You gotta fight
the powers that be
And when I rolled
with the punches
We gotta fight
the powers that be
Huh?
Oh, my God.
It means cover me, go left.
Read the manual, why don't you?
Wait for my three count.
One... two...
Unbelievable.
FBI! Freeze!
Hands on top of your head!
On your head!
Surprise.
We've checked everywhere.
There's nothing.
Place is clean, Ashburn.
Looks like your...
...theory has a few holes in it.
Let's roll, boys.
So you think it's clean, huh?
Oh, here we go.
That's what they said last year
right before I arrested
the Red Falls Killer.
What are those?
Barbecued spare ribs?
Is that what that is?
I don't know,
maybe I'm wrong. Or...
...maybe I'm not.
Yeah. Airtight.
Dipped in wax.
I respect that.
I especially like the meat
to distract the dog.
And while that may have fooled the
loudest breather in the world...
...it did not fool me.
And unfortunately it's not
what I'm looking for.
So let's just cut to the chase.
Are there guns in the house?
I don't know anything
about any guns.
ASHBURN: Interesting.
Maybe I'm wrong... you know?
Wait for it.
Maybe these guys
are right for a change.
Stranger things
have happened, right?
That's a trap.
ASHBURN: Meteors, comets...
Somebody married Pete and he
can't even count to three.
See? Right there.
ASHBURN: Oh, so frustrating.
You know, they loved these houses
during the prohibition era.
You guys know what
prohibition is, don't you?
Yeah, selling your ass
for money?
Really?
No, it was alcohol.
People loved to drink it, even
though they weren't supposed to.
And these houses
had all these nooks
and crannies where they could hide it.
Like this one.
Is there something behind me?
There is, isn't there?
Fuck.
Now you can roll.
Gentlemen.
Nice work, dick.
Let's go!
Hard to believe she's single.
DOCTOR: Immediately below that,
you feel a little crease...
Wow, that's pretty impressive, huh?
Do you see that?
Look at that.
DOCTOR'. Make an incision
right through there.
ASHBURN: That's
pretty amazing, huh?
Pretty amazing.
WOMAN: Pumpkin!
Here, kitty, kitty!
Are you at
the neighbor's again?
Pumpkin!
Here, kitty, kitty!
Go on home. I'll see you tomorrow.
There you go.
Pumpkin, I told you to stay
away from that weird lady.
Oh, boy. Wife doesn't like
you working late, huh?
What do you want?
Oh, just letting you know that I
have been observing the agents.
Overseeing what
they've been up to,
you know...
keeping an eye on them.
Yeah. Supervising.
Supervising. Yes, sir.
Look, Ashburn.
I haven't made
any decisions yet.
Oh, of course not.
Everyone deserves a shot.
I don't know if you are the
right person for this position.
I'm sorry, what?
I'm confused.
Walk with me.
I've closed more cases than any agent here.
Should I not have done that?
You are a solid agent. There
are many other solid agents.
None of them have closed
the Red Falls Killer case.
Ashburn, it's no secret that none
of the other agents like you.
What?
I've gotten
countless complaints
of arrogance and competitiveness.
..showmanship.
Just give it a rest.
All right. We've got
a situation in Boston.
The Feds picked up chatter
on a guy moving in.
Simon Larkin.
We don't know what he looks like,
where he comes from, nothing.
We believe this guy is
doing the legwork for him.
Julian Vincent.
Nasty son of a bitch.
Murder. Extortion.
This is his M.O.
The problem with
guys like that is...
...everyone's
too scared to talk.
Pack your bags.
I'm sending you to Boston.
You know how to get
inside people's heads.
You want to find Larkin,
get to Julian.
You do well with this,
we can talk about the job.
She's got stickers
on her locker
And the boys' numbers there
in magic marker
I'm hungry and
the hunger will linger
I eat sixteen saltine crackers
then I lick my fingers
Well, every morning
I deliver the news...
MAN: Hey, Rojas sent me over.
He said you were really nice.
GIRL: Yeah,
what you looking for?
What's your name?
Champaz. What's yours?
MAN: Champaz?
Did your mom
give you that name?
GIRL:
Not exactly.
DISPATCHER: Hey, Mullins. Captain
wants to know when you're coming in.
You know what? Tell him I'll be there
sharply at go-fuck-yourself o'clock.
Okay? If there's no traffic.
Thank you.
That seems kind of expensive.
Expensive?
Can you break a hundred?
GIRL: No, I'm not gonna
break a hundred.
I don't think I have that.
Do you have a discount?
What's going on here?
Okay, I don't want any drugs.
All right? Oh!
How you doing?
Are you trying to get a
deal on my girl here?
Are you her pimp?
No, we're just friends.
Well, I think this is just between
her and I, so...
Am I invading your space here?
MAN: Kind Of.
I don't want to do that. Let
me see if this'll help you.
I just want to...
Oh!
It's a good thing I didn't
get the drugs from you.
Yeah, can you imagine that?
That would have been crazy.
That would have been bad.
That would have been bad!
Phew!
You'd better wipe that brow.
Listen, I gotta ask. Whatever... But
what was actually going on here?
We were just...
She looked kind of sad, so I thought I'd
help her out and give her a ride home.
That's nice, like a good Samaritan.
Yeah.
Are you depressed? Was he
giving you a ride home?
Yeah, I was cheering you up.
Yeah, good for you.
You know who else is pretty sad?
Frank over here.
Right, Frank? You get sad 'cause
you shit and piss yourself?
You having a sad day, Frank?
Hey, maybe you can put him
in the back of your car.
You want to shit and piss
all over this guy's car?
Let's open up the...
Frank, you wanna shit your pants and get in the...
Oh, Good, it's open.
I can put Frank in there.
He can shit and piss
himself until he's happy.
I got some towels...
Does that sound good?
Why don't you let me
see your I.D.?
Oh, come on, please?
Let me take the whole thing.
I don't...
It's good, I got it.
Oh, good.
I got nervous that
maybe you didn't have
a wife and a whole
bunch of kids, but...
...luckily you do.
What's your wife's name?
Bella.
Oh, Bella. Good.
Hey, can I borrow your phone for a minute?
My battery's out.
Why do you want
to borrow my phone?
Because I asked
you for your phone.
Give me your fucking phone.
Shut your mouth.
Can you give me one chance here?
Yeah, I'll give you one chance.
Yeah, who's this? Is this Bella?
No, no, no!
Don't do that. Don't do that.
This is Officer Mullins.
I'm here with your husband.
God! What are you, Spock?
No, he's not been in an
accident, unfortunately.
I do have him here
with a known prostitute.
She's lying!
Bella, she's lying!
Oh, that's not
the first time, huh?
Yeah, that's him. He's crying because
I'm breaking his fucking hand.
Oh, she said do it harder.
Ow! All right, Bella.
That's for Bella.
You got to go with
your instincts, Bella.
You're welcome.
She's probably gonna
burn your shit today.
You don't understand.
She just had a baby.
There's a lot going on down there.
I'm not gonna touch that!
Why don't you take
your seatbelt off?
Come on, please.
You seem reasonable.
Take your fucking belt off.
You look like you
got some compassion.
I love the sound
of a guy that...
...after his wife gives him
his fifth fucking child,
complains about
her messy vagina.
And then you don't want
to fucking touch her?
I can unlock the door!
Get out of the fucking car!
Get out of the fucking car!
MAN: Are you kidding me?
Get up against the car.
What is your problem?
You want to do that?
It's hot! The car is hot!
Good! I hope it burns
your fucking dick off.
MULLINS: Hey, it's Rojas!
My favorite asshole.
Look what I found.
Did I take some of your business away?
That's a shame.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I just stand on this corner...
...and do my sodukas, okay?
Oh, is that right? First of
all, it's sudoku, dumb-ass.
And you want to tell me that
you're just here coincidentally?
Right in the middle
of all the prostitutes?
Lady, why are you
so obsessed with me?
You should be ashamed,
trying to break down a successful
black man. You racist?
Don't play that race
bullshit card with me!
Nine out of ten guys
I fuck are black guys!
Lady, what you need to do is go down
the road, take a vacation, okay?
And go get your groove back.
Lady, just relax. Chill. Okay?
What is that?
Take off.
That's what I thought.
MAN: I'm not
a part of this!
MULLINS: Shut up! Shut up!
MAN: Oh, my God!
Oh, it's on.
She's crazy!
Come on, please let me out. I
get really carsick.
Oh, no, that's terrible!
I got him now.
I got him!
You are a meth head!
Oh, my God!
Hey, look who's here!
Yeah, you better run!
Oh, shit.
I got him! I got him!
You piece of shit, I said stop!
I said stop!
I said stop!
You're crushing my balls!
I hope they fucking rupture!
Lady, get the fuck off me! What
the hell is wrong with you?
Bella, I'm sorry!
Let me go! Hold still,
you piece of shit!
My leg, lady! Let me go!
What is wrong with you?
I'll tell you what's the matter with me!
It's you, piece of shit!
Son of a bitch!
Stop moving!
Leave me alone!
Get off me! Get off me!
Shit. OW!
MULLINS: Yeah.
What the hell did
you throw at me?
A watermelon.
A watermelon?
Aw, hell, no! See, I told
you you was a racist.
I tried to hit you with my car.
What's that make me?
Let's see what you got in...
Oh, look at this!
Look at this.
Not even my birthday.
Hey, you planted
that shit on me!
Yeah, I planted it.
I'm innocent!
Shut up before I feed you watermelon.
Get up!
Levy?
Federal Agent Sarah Ashburn
from the New York field office.
Hi, how are you?
I need all your files on all
known drug dealers of the area.
Right. We heard
you were coming.
Actually, I was expecting it.
I'll show you to your desk.
Not necessary.
I won't be here long.
I can carry these.
Thank you.
Whoa! Hey! Ashburn!
Oh!
Oh, God!
You okay?
What is it?
Low-end dealer just brought
into the East Boston precinct.
Name's Terrell Rojas.
Oh. Oh, okay.
Good. Thank you very much.
Good luck out there.
It's not about luck, pal.
Not about luck.
Wow.
That was almost cool.
Almost.
Come on, come on.
Ain't gonna fucking park today?
All right.
Here we go. Finally.
I'm moving in there!
No, don't...
Hey, hey!
No, get back in your car!
Hey, asshole!
Goddamn it!
FBI.
Hey, you need to sign in.
Captain Woods?
Captain Woods?
Christ.
I'm sorry?
Uh... How can I help you?
Special Agent Sarah Ashburn.
We got intel recently
that you brought in
a dealer by the name
of Terrell Rojas.
Yeah, but Detective Mullins
isn't back from lunch yet.
I'm sure he won't mind.
He's a she, and we're not
allowed to go near her collars.
Let me tell you what I think.
Every second
we're standing here
is interfering with
the federal investigation.
So if you'd be so kind
as to show Mr. Rojas
to an interrogation room.
Thank you.
Special Agent?
This way.
Special Agent.
Special Agent.
Shit.
You are looking at
possession with intent...
...which is a class D drug charge,
chapter 94C, section 32A.
I had a joint and a few
little bags of coke.
Since when is
that shit illegal?
The answer to your
question is always.
And with your priors...
...you are looking at 25 years
and some pretty stiff fines.
Who the hell cares about fines?
That's 25 years!
Never mind. Let's see
what you make of these.
What I make of them...
...is that somebody doesn't want
somebody else selling on their turf.
But you're still here... and you're alive.
Why is that?
Who you working for?
Nobody.
Who you working for?
Nobody.
Who you working for?
Nobody!
If I tell you,
that's my ass chopped up
into a million
motherfucking pieces!
Goddamn it.
Fucker
God. Puss!
Motherfucker!
Everybody's got to fucking
park in my spot. Goddamn it!
Shit! Suit-wearing, god...
Ow, fuck!
I said I'm fucking parking there!
Steal my goddamn fucking space!
I don't
want you to do time.
I don't want you to get chopped
up into little, tiny...
...mother-F-ing pieces. Oh.
I can protect you. I can.
But you've got to help me.
I can help you.
You'll help me?
Yeah.
Where can I find Julian?
I get my stuff from this bitch
named Tatiana on Newkirk Avenue.
Can you describe her?
She got brown eyes.
She got some
big-ass breastses.
Big breastses.
Okay.
Can you maybe be a little
bit more specific?
Her breastses is like this.
Okay. Thank you.
That's a shame.
Don't.
Oh! Ha-ha! Oh, yeah!
We're at a comedy party!
Move the fuck out of my way.
Get a room.
Tim, you still owe me $40.
Yeah, tomorrow it's $60!
Fucking dickweed.
Why is the cage empty?
What did I tell you
about moving my prisoners?
He's in interrogation.
Why would he be in interrogation
when I'm standing right here?
They came and got him.
Who's "they"?
It better be two of me.
Is it two of me?
It was a lady.
I'm a lady.
Did I come and get him?
No, it was a different lady.
She was nice.
I'm fucking nice.
Why was she nice to you?
She made me give her the keys.
I'm gonna make you
fucking bend over...
...and I'm gonna reach up
your ass into your pocket
and get the keys to your house.
Then I'm gonna drive there...
...come in your front door
and kill you in your sleep.
I think I have a clear idea
of what we're looking for,
and I appreciate your time.
Wow, lady, you're on
a real fucking roll.
Excuse me?
No, I won't excuse you.
I just spent the last 30 minutes
thinking of ways to kill you.
I'm sorry, when did we meet?
Is this your lawyer?
Are you an insurance salesman?
Do you sell those shitty suits?
I'm Special Agent Sarah Ashburn.
How can I help you?
You can get all of that
and get the fuck out of here.
This is my room
Were you about to be
questioned by a detective?
I am a detective
and that's my perp.
Ah! I understand now.
Detective, Mr. Rojas will
be continuing on with me.
No.
It's a jurisdictional issue.
Not gonna happen.
Your efforts are duly noted.
Oh, great.
And if you're okay with
everything, could you just...
...close the door on the way out?
I'll shut the door on you.
Will you lay down and put
your head in the door?
I'll slam it
about 157,000 times.
Aw, shit, girl, you better run.
Shut your mouth.
Run like you on fire.
Be quiet.
Get up and we'll
settle this outside.
I won't be going outside.
You're gonna get up
and come outside.
No, ma'am.
Fine. We'll do this inside.
Can somebody remove this person
from the interrogation room?
Mental illness is nothing to be ashamed of.
It runs in many families.
I'm gonna hit you.
You're not. Please don't.
I'm gonna hit you and knock
all your little buttons.
I'm gonna hit you there,
or here...
Do not put your finger in...
Stop touching my buttons!
Stop wearing buttons.
Don't move those
fucking hands at me.
I'll get that stupid barrette!
I'll take that barrette right
out of your fucking hair!
Stop, stop, stop!
Both of you... my office now.
Nope. Not in there.
There is nothing I can do, Mullins.
The FBI has jurisdiction.
Maybe they're in here.
Stop. Will you stop?
Nope, they're not in there.
What is she doing?
She's looking for my balls.
Hey, if anyone sees
the Captain's balls...
...let me know. They're about
this big, but a lot tinier.
They're like a pea... or
like a ball bearing.
Or if you've ever seen a mouse
ball, about half that size.
Incredibly tiny. They're
like really, really tiny...
...little girl balls.
If little girls had balls.
So if you find little,
tiny girl balls...
...that are so fucking
tiny and shriveled up...
...let me know, because I'll put
them right back up his scrotum!
Knock it off.
How about you do
something for once?
What do you want me to do?
Have my back
and stop being so goddamn
disappointing like everybody else!
Well, that was professional.
Was that not professional?
Here.
Let me be professional. Let
me help you pick up your bag.
That's very mature.
Let me just
straighten that shit up.
Oh, wait, hey!
Good news! Good news,
I found his balls!
In a clear sack! Yeah, enjoy that.
Shove those back up there.
Cop of the year!
Keep it up!
This job is destroying me.
You know how old I am?
I'm 43 years old.
Mmm-hmm.
Well, I always round up.
I have a five-year-old son
who calls me grandpa!
So, uh... anyhoo, sir...
...if you could
just... you know...
...keep her... away from me...
...that would
be... very helpful.
She stole your keys,
didn't she?
Yes, she did. Do you know
where I can find her?
She's probably at O'Flanagan's.
It's a bar down the street.
It's a little divey.
You might want to wear a vest.
I'm next to that cheese
like rat traps
On top of that green
like grass ass
That's over y'all head
like snapbacks
I get it where I fit in,
put up then I put in
Tryna find an ass
I can put my fucking foot in
Run this shit,
no, I run this shit
Don't give one fuck, bitch
I done this shit...
Sir, is this place open?
Is there a door... Oh.
So there is. Could you point
it out to me with your finger?
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
ASHBURN: Hand them over.
Give me the keys. Now.
Oh, my God.
Did you drop something?
I apologize.
You are so concerned about
taking down a guy like Rojas...
...wasting all this time
when I could have stopped a drug
lord who is far more dangerous...
...and supplies to
people like Rojas.
Bullshit. Who?
Okay, you want to
see some bull feces?
I think I said "bullshit".
Here's some bull poo-poo.
How does that look?
See that? Oh, come on.
I got a kid here.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I'm very, very sorry.
Wait a minute, this is a bar.
No, absolutely not.
No, no, no, no.
Why do I not know
who Simon Larkin is?
That would probably be because
the FBI knows more than you do.
Anything happening in my
neighborhood I have a right to know.
No, you actually don't.
You want to know.
And you do not
have the clearance
that would allow you to read
everything that is in this file.
Okay, all right!
When bad shit happens
in my neighborhood,
I get a little
passionate about it.
I shouldn't have read your files.
I went too far.
Well, I accept your apology.
But you need to understand that
this is a highly important case.
And the information is
highly, highly sensitive.
Therefore we have
these clearances.
I don't have the clearances.
Right? I mean, you are...
You are, wow, FBI.
I mean, you are a goddamn
angel of the law.
Well, that's a little...
I want you to spread those
wings and just soar.
Watch it!
You watch it.
I'm a federal agent.
WOMAN: Oh, yeah? Well, guess what, you dick!
I'm a federal agent, too!
I work at the post office.
Well, I appreciate the work you do
for us on the ground. Thank you.
You bet your ass you do.
I see no one will be
getting their mail today!
MULLINS: Good burn.
Good burn. You got burned,
you big drunk paddy!
WOMAN: Kiss my cunt,
you twat!
So we are good?
Thank you.
Thank you.
America thanks you.
And I it.
And it you.
Thank you.
Whoa!
Yes, okay.
Good day.
Dumbass.
MULLINS: So how
you been, Jason?
You want to talk
about Simon Larkin?
I never heard of him.
Don't lie to me.
You're my brother,
I know when you're lying.
I'm just a low-level guy.
I heard of Larkin
but I never met him.
He's a goddamn animal, and I'm
trying to keep him from meeting you.
You gonna storm through Boston
and take down a drug lord?
Yeah, I might.
Have you met me?
Yeah, unfortunately.
Yeah, shut up.
Look, I get out tomorrow.
I'm coming home.
I'm gonna be fine.
I promise, all right?
Oh! Never approach me if
I'm not expecting you!
What are you, an animal?
You said you would
stay off my case,
and now I find you in front
of Tatiana's apartment.
I live here.
Oh, that's hilarious.
You know what's not funny?
That you stole a
confidential FBI case file.
I don't remember any of that.
I'm going to say it one more time.
Stand down, Officer.
Fuck off, Officer.
Oh, okay, now you've really done it.
I'm going to call my boss.
Yeah, you do that, tattle tits!
Fucking narc!
Unbelievable. Unbelievable.
It's Ashburn, sir.
I need authorization...
...to suspend a police officer
from my investigation.
Ashburn, why is working with local
authorities a problem for you?
I understand how this might
sound coming from me...
...but I think this individual might
actually be mentally unstable.
Her captain says she
grew up on those streets
and knows them
better than anyone.
That seems like an asset
to our investigation.
Sir, I...
No, just work with her.
Show me you can do this
or forget the promotion.
Well, sir, no need to take someone's badge.
I think I can, uh...
I think I can work
something out, sir.
All right. Thank you.
You know, uh...
I just...
I think you and I got off
on the wrong foot.
Oh!
I don't know Boston,
and you obviously have...
...a lot of resources and a lot of
knowledge about the area that could be,
you know, useful.
Probably very.
So, uh...
...maybe we can work
together on this.
I don't need your help
to take down Larkin.
You wouldn't even have known
about Larkin if not for me.
So obviously the FBI can
get information you can't.
And there's a lot more
where that comes from. A lot!
Maybe I just need to hear a little
"I need your help, Mullins."
I won't be doing that.
Okay, then get your
ass back in your car.
This is ridiculous.
I'm an FBI agent.
You're a police officer.
"I need your help, Mullins."
I need your help, Mullins.
What is this, a whisper party? I
want that third floor to hear it.
"I need your help, Mullins." Then
give me a little echo on "Mullins".
I need your help, Mullins,
Mullins, Mullins...
Just move. Move, move!
God! Even in that,
you're annoying.
I will work with you...
...as long as we're clear
that this is my case.
That's actually
not... correct.
Awesome.
Glad you see it my way.
Careful of the car.
Goddamn it.
Stand down.
I got it.
If you just let go...
I got it.
ASHBURN: I have it,
just let me...
MULLINS: I've got it.
I got it.
Oh, shit!
Ma'am, you, uh...
Let me take the lead on this.
I'm a trained interviewer.
"Interviewer?" What are
you, Barbara Walters?
I thought we'd go in there and
bring in some heat on her.
I'm sorry, what does
that even mean?
Me and you, we're the heat.
We go in there, interrogate her,
scare the shit out of her...
We don't say "interrogation".
It's too aggressive.
Rule number one, catch more
with sugar than with a stick.
That's a horrible
fucking saying.
We like to create a genuine
personal interest in the subject,
allowing them to open up.
Then I'll perform instant
personality assessments
based on
the Myers-Briggs theory...
...Thematic
Apperception Tests and...
...a few others I
won't bore you with.
Well, lam balls deep
in boredom.
All right, as long as
you don't do that
whole long explanation again...
...we'll try it
your way first.
Only because you're older.
Oh, my God.
Tatiana Krumova, lam Special
Agent Sarah Ashburn...
...and this is Detective Mullins.
Detective Mullins.
And we'd like to ask you a few questions
if you could give us a moment.
Oh, shoot. You know, now is bad.
I'm making butter.
How about other time?
If you could just give... How
about right fucking now?
Right fucking now!
Well, Tatiana, thank you.
This is very kind of you.
So...
How long have you lived here?
I've lived here
since I moved in.
Okay, that's
very... very helpful.
Okay, we'll get
a little more specific.
What do you do for a living?
I know what this asshole
does for a living.
What you know, asshole?
Sugar, no stick.
It is Bulgarian, is it not?
No, I'm fucking French!
Oh, Jesus.
Tatiana...
I don't understand
what you are saying.
Nice bullshit Bulgarian.
That was perfect Bulgarian.
I mean I don't understand
what you are talking about!
Why I go to jail
when I don't do shits?
Ah! So she did understand what I
was saying, just not the context.
Oh, sweet God.
All right, Rosetta Stone,
you're done.
Ugh! Oh, Jesus.
How many porns have been
made on this couch?
Oh, this couch not of your satisfaction?
You're not comfy?
I'll get comfy. When
my foot's up your ass.
Wow.
That'll make me really comfy.
Don't poke me!
Tatiana, I want to
get really real.
You ready to get real?
Let's get real.
Okay, we both know you've been
blowing shit up your nose all day.
Man, I get it. There's nothing
more I'd love to do than...
...slip into my camisole, put my
feet up, have a little smack.
Real good time,
maybe a couple cold ones,
a little chip and dip,
watch some cartoons.
I'd get a big bowl of coke...
I'd put my face in it, cut
it with a little Ritalin...
Heaven on fucking earth, right?
Sure.
I'd camp out all week
for tickets to that show.
What is this, Training
All fucking week
I'd camp out for that!
But you, you piece of shit, you've
been rolling deep for a long time.
And now it's time you open
up that goddamn mouth
and tell us what
we want to know.
You got good point. I tell you what.
I open my mouth.
You get the fuck
out my house now!
How's that for open mouth?
Fuck out! Get fuck out!
Yeah, I'll get the fuck out.
All right.
You should really stop smoking
because it's an awfully bad habit.
You're leaving half your
lipstick in the ashtray.
I had a great aunt that lost
most of her teeth to smoking.
Good to know.
A lot of fistfights,
too, but mostly smoking.
We're gonna get
out of your hair.
That is not front door.
Puty our hands
where I can see 'em!
Don't fucking move.
Is this your drug mule?
Oh, my gosh!
TATIANA: That's my mother!
Do you have balloons
of horse up your ass?
You break my fucking door!
Stand down, Officer.
Who closes the door
to take a shit?
Humans do.
Don't touch underpants!
Get out, bull in china shop!
Out of my house!
What the fuck's wrong with you?
Wow, you are just
all stick and no sugar.
Did you get
the cigarette or not?
Uh, yeah... of course I did.
Yeah.
I snagged these matches, too. I think
our guy likes to go to Club Ekko.
Really?
Yes, really.
Let's find out, shall we?
Hang on. The couch was disgusting.
I need to wash my hands.
Wait a minute,
you do live here?
That's what I said.
Oh.
Wow, your windows
are all boarded up.
Yeah, I've got the glass,
I just don't have the...
you know, window blankets.
The curtains?
You mean the curtains?
Whatever. Okay?
That's just my family.
ASHBURN: Oh.
Yeah, it's sweet.
You want something to eat?
I didn't finish my submarine
sandwich the other day.
No, thank you.
Sorry I don't have poached
eggs in rubies for you.
No, I don't mean
to be rude, but...
...one could catch a MRSA
infection in here, that's all.
What part of that wasn't rude?
Just for your own well-being.
For example, that door.
That door has no
way of locking.
Someone could barge in at any moment.
It's not safe.
No one's coming in here...
...because they know
I keep this fully stocked.
Oh, my God.
Yeah, I know.
A Marlin 1894CB?
Is that an FN PS90?
Yeah! Nice one.
You have all of this
in your house?
You didn't even
mention my baby.
Look at this.
Oh!
My little pride and joy.
This little beauty could
vaporize an above-ground pool.
If you didn't want
the pool anymore.
No kidding.
Pretty, huh?
Yeah. How do you refuse
that sales pitch, huh?
You don't.
Unless you're an asshole.
I haven't seen one of these
since World War ll.
No! God,
that... occasionally ticks.
Put it back slowly.
Slowly!
Like half that speed.
Half that speed!
Stop shaking.
Put your pinky down.
I got it on eBay. It was supposed
to be bigger and different.
It doesn't matter.
I'm gonna "Bad Feedback"
his ass, though.
LEVY; All right, ladies.
Here's the DNA results
from the book of matches
and the cigarette butt
you got from Tatiana's.
We pulled two sets of prints.
First one's a real nut job.
Look at this. Reckless
driving, assault, arson.
Oh, God.
Ahem! Really?
Who the fuck is this guy?
He's my assistant.
You know I'm an agent, right?
Arson?
It was a drug house!
I really feel the need
to finish reading your files.
I feel the need for you to
stay out of my business
so I don't punch
you in the teeth.
What did you find out
about the cigarette?
Okay. Hank LeSoire.
Local businessman.
Got tons of ties to the
drug world, black market...
...as well as prostitution rings.
Co-owner of Club Ekko.
It looks like we found our distributor.
Can you back that up, please?
Back up to which one?
That.
I'm not into you!
Your breast is
invading my space.
Keep your finger
out of my areola.
Contain your areola!
MULLINS: There. Now we're even.
He looks like a real Chatty Cathy.
Did you tap the phone?
LEVY: I haven't been able to. Guy
gets a new prepaid every other week.
By the time I can
get his phone number
and hack in,
he's got a new one.
Let's get a bug into the
phone he does have.
I want to know what
he's saying this week.
Just get a court order and a bug.
We'll do it ourselves.
If you're gonna boss me around,
at least buy me dinner first.
No.
Okay. Cool.
I'll get that to you ASAP.
You got to work on your game.
That was weak.
What? I thought I
was being charming.
I don't know what to say to that.
Now I just feel bad for you.
Okay, so LeSoire
co-owns Club Ekko.
Let's start surveilling it and figure
out how to get a bug in his phone.
Tell me everything
you know about it.
It's just
a shitty club downtown.
I've never been inside,
but there's always a line of
awful people around the corner.
They've called P.D. a couple
times to break up fights.
Oh, shit.
What's wrong?
Just don't look. Don't look!
Act like we're talking.
Hey, Shannon.
Hey, Robin.
I really enjoyed our night together.
You just disappeared on me.
Yeah, I know.
I was there.
Can I take you to dinner,
or a movie, or something?
Do you not hear how pathetic
everything out of your mouth sounds?
There's a girl out there
for you, but it's not me.
Maybe it's her. Her lady business
is like an old dirty attic.
It's full of broken Christmas
lights and doll shoes and shit.
Why don't you
clean that out for her?
ASHBURN: That's a
misrepresentation of my vagina.
Wow, what was that about?
You sleep with a guy one time and he
wants to marry you. Jesus Christ!
Yeah, I know what you mean.
Who was that?
My mom.
SPORTS ANNOUNCER: Ortiz
settles in the batter's box.
Verlander with the pitch.
A ground ball...
...through the legs of Cabrera
into right field.
Pedroia is headed for second base.
He slides, and he is...
How about I tell you
a little something
about myself?
Oh, God.
Let's see...
I went to undergrad at Yale.
I have been with the Bureau
for about twelve years.
Up for a promotion.
See, I caught
the Red Falls Killer.
I remember thinking
that guy was innocent.
He's been in jail for eleven months.
That would make me...
...a horrible person if what
you said was actually factual.
Well, you can just tell
the judge you fucked up.
I didn't. I did not F up.
Don't get your
panties in a wad.
They're not wadded.
I'm intuitive. I say what I feel.
I'm usually right.
Take it or leave it.
Oh, I did not know.
MULLINS: Okay.
There's our guy.
I see him as well.
Well, Daft Punk
is playing at my house
I'll show you the ropes, kid,
show you the ropes
I got a bus and a
trailer at my house
There he is. Over there.
We got to get past
those bodyguards.
We won't have to,
because he'll come to us.
Excuse me!
Step aside, please!
All right.
This will go fast.
When I pull the alarm, the crowd
will head towards the two exits.
He will head toward
the nearest one,
which is northeast.
I will bump into him.
I will grab the cell, place the bug
in it, tell him he dropped the phone.
It's something I like
to call a "cop drop".
Yeah, I got it.
Okay... here we go.
My God, there are no wires
attached to this thing.
What is that? Gum?
Or is it Silly Putty?
Don't touch it!
It's a condom.
All right,
he's on the move.
We got to get out there and shake our
asses like the rest of the foxes.
Oh, yes, dancing to get close to him.
Fantastic idea!
Jesus. Don't!
Don't do anything you're doing.
But he's over that way.
Let's just go find a bathroom.
I told you, I don't have
to use the bathroom!
Did I ask about your bathroom habits?
You are killing us out there.
You don't fit in! Take
off that fucking jacket.
This is a good jacket.
You look like you're
gonna set up a table
and do their taxes.
Take it off!
This is ridiculous.
Your shitty jacket?
My God!
Okay, jacket's off.
Jacket's off.
I can't watch whatever
process is about to happen.
Now unbutton your buttons.
I'm a federal agent!
I know, and you look like one.
You think you'll bump into him and
he won't think something's up?
Fine. How's that? Is that good?
Can we go?
No, I think it's getting worse.
My fear is I'm gonna
put you in a bikini
and you'll still look like
a fucking bank teller.
Do you have to
use that language?
I'm trying to make a point!
I'm saying your face
and whatever is underneath this
shitty outfit is
maybe not terrible.
I'll have you know I
dress appropriately.
I got it!
It's when this...
...your big flapping mouth, starts
running, and then you put...
...this getup on top of it, and it's just...
it's a boner killer.
I'm gonna help you.
What are you doing?
Now I just want you to shut up.
on, my God.
Oh, my God! I only brought
five of these to Boston!
I'll cut the other four.
God, that's terrible fabric!
Just get that off your wrist.
This one was of
my favorite ones.
Just take it off.
Take it off!
Okay, just give me a second!
Okay, I look like
I've been attacked.
That's not my fault.
Oh, it's my fault? Let
me even out the bottom.
Would you stop
carving up my clothes?
I'm making shorts!
Everybody likes shorts.
Jesus! Hold still!
That feels... awkward. Weird.
Don't touch that area.
Don't duck down, or you're
gonna suck my hand up there.
Will you stop
pulling my pants off?
Jesus!
What?
What are those?
What are those?
Stop it!
They're my Spanx. They
hold everything together.
Why? What's gonna
come popping out?
Nothing! It just keeps everything
where it's supposed to be.
Shit, like medically?
No, not medically.
Just to...
It just keeps it right
where it's supposed to be.
You got to vent that furnace.
That's a lot of
compression and heat.
It gets plenty of
ventilation, thank you.
My hand's a foot off
and it's on fire.
Then why don't you
cut them shorter
because no one can
see my cervix yet?
I'll cut them shorter. No, stop it!
We're finished.
Okay, let's do you now.
I don't need that!
What do you mean?
I put my sexuality
out through motion.
When this starts going, it's all...
You'll get it.
So I have to look like this and
you get to look like that?
I know, it's not fair.
We gotta tackle the helmet.
It's got a real style
memory, huh?
You gotta flip that shit over.
Bend over.
Why?
You look like Darth Vader.
Just flip it over.
God Almighty.
I gotta just finger tease
the shit out of this.
Wait. What?
I'm gonna finger tease it.
What is that?
What does that mean?
Not what you want it to mean.
Hit it!
What are you looking at?
I like how your friend's shorts
make me feel in my shorts.
I am sorry. That was much
cruder than I meant it to be.
I stand corrected on the shorts.
Let's proceed.
Oh, God, we're dead.
ASHBURN: At one o'clock.
MULLINS: Let's do this.
All right.
Get in there.
Get in there.
How do you get in?
I don't know how.
Back it in.
Get in there. Get your hands
in and get the phone.
Okay, Pinky.
Do the cop drop.
I'm trying to!
Do the fucking cop drop!
I can't do it
from this position!
No. No, no, no!
Okay, coming in one more time.
Get her away.
MULLINS: I got her! But
you're like a fucking nanny!
Picture time!
Damn it. Can somebody
get my phone?
ASHBURN: I got it!
I got it! Let go!
LeSOIRE: Thanks a lot, bro. And close
a couple buttons... club policy.
ASHBURN: God bless!
MULLINS: I got
the orange one!
I need some water.
Stop it! Stop it!
I will fucking kill you.
Where is he?
Get in there.
Okay, one more time.
Get her away.
MULLINS: Jesus,
there's too many of them!
LeSOIRE Hello.
ASHBURN: Hi.
Your moves are weird
as shit... and I love it.
You have really soft hair.
Oh, yeah,
it's the shampoo move!
MULLINS: Use your boobs!
You see these?
Oh, God, yeah.
I'm looking, I'm liking.
Oh, girl, so great!
Hey, what is this?
What's going on? Whoa!
Oh, God, back it in.
Whoa, please!
Hi.
Hi.
You're the first chick over
forty to give me a boner.
Great.
Want to go get a drink?
Okay. Yeah.
Maybe. Maybe.
That's the only reason
girls hit on me.
Oh, sorry, yeah.
Every night, the hottest
chicks come in here.
They're like, "There's LeSoire!"
Short skirts, too much makeup.
Looking like fucking gremlins.
Oh, I hate that!
Don't feed them after midnight, right?
They turn into more sluts.
Give me a whiskey.
I just noticed that lion.
That is amazing.
Fuck!
Who the fuck keeps putting
lions in the back?
Fourteen dollars.
Fourteen dollars?
Is it magic fucking whiskey?
Do I get a motorcycle with it?
Is it served in Jesus's shoe?
Can I sit in your lap?
Obviously.
I like where this is going.
ASHBURN: Me, too.
I would love to!
LeSOIRE: We're having
a big foam party later.
ASHBURN: So sorry.
I am so sorry.
LeSOIRE: Drunk bitch.
Get her out of here.
ASHBURN: She holds her
liquor like a five-year-old.
MULLINS: I'm so sorry!
All right, sweetheart, you're out.
ASHBURN: Sorry.
MULLINS:  I'm a pony!
ASHBURN: Sorry.
Get her the fuck out!
Take her home.
I've got to drive the school bus tomorrow!
It's my shift.
It's my shift!
BOUNCER: Here we go.
I didn't get your number!
I'll find you. I'll find you.
Oh! Pretty nice, right?
Ooh!
I have to say that
was pretty awesome.
It really was. Put her there.
Put her there!
No, put her there.
Ah!
Don't do that.
You just make it odd.
I'm trying not to
lash out at you,
and you make it
really impossible.
What was that about?
We got company.
Oh, shit.
Hold on, I can lose them.
You want me to take the wheel?
No, I was a precision
driver at Quantico.
They thought I was the instructor...
I was that good.
Oh, shoot.
Lose them!
What do you think
I'm trying to do?
Stop it! Stop it!
I got it.
Hold on.
ASHBURN: Ah!
And that is how
you lose a tail.
Nicely done.
I'm surprised.
Our friends are back.
I got it. I got it.
Tag out.
What are you doing?
I'll show you
how I stop a tail.
MULLINS;  Watch out!
FBI! Drop your weapon!
Oh, my God.
What the hell is that?
I don't know.
Special Agent Garrett, DEA!
Drop it!
No, seriously,
what the fuck are you?
What are you, fucking deaf?
I just told you, DEA!
Drop your fucking gun!
Now!
Shit.
I'm very sorry about earlier.
I just thought you
were an assassin.
Because of your... weapon.
And because you
look evil as shit.
Yeah, I get it. I'm an albino,
so I look like a bad guy, right?
No, that's not what we were...
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah, well, I'm DEA! And
let me tell you something.
Two months we've been
sitting on that club,
then you two
come in one night...
...like a couple of amateurs and
almost blow the whole thing!
Obviously you have no idea
who you are speaking with.
I'm Federal Agent
Sarah Ashburn.
Yes, I'm sure your credentials
are quite impressive,
as is your choice
of... wardrobe.
Nice hot pants.
You might want to try
shaving above
the knee next time.
Are you giving beauty tips?
Do you own a fucking mirror?
Listen. This whole "female
professionals in the workplace" thing,
I'm fine with it.
But the problem, all due
respect with you people...
...is that you get all excited,
your emotions take over...
...your hormones kick in, you're
riding the cotton pony...
Next thing you know
you're complimenting
the bad guy on
his fucking couch!
Oh, all due respect to you,
who's your wife?
A five-pound bag of flour
with a hole in it?
ADAM: Hey, hey, hey!
Listen, ma'ams.
We've been cramped inside
this van for two months.
We're not gonna
let you swoop in
from nowhere and
take all the credit.
I don't want to see you two
anywhere near this case!
We have got
informants everywhere!
We've got
surveillance everywhere!
We do not need
the two of you...
...coming in with your estrogen
flying at full speed...
...sticking out in the middle of broad
daylight fucking things up for us!
Because the two of us are
gonna bring these guys in.
Fuck you, chalk balls!
Not even on your birthday,
sweetheart.
That's right, keep walking.
This isn't over.
FYI, we women were born
with hair on our legs.
You don't have to stop.
What are you doing? Whoa!
You want to tell me
what was wrong back there?
Nothing.
I saw your face when
you watched the footage.
It looked like you saw someone you knew.
Possibly your brother?
You did not read that
from my fucking face.
You read my file, didn't you?
God, you're an asshole!
Yes, I read it,
but it is my job
to know everything
about a case,
including who I work with.
I don't like that.
We should talk to him tomorrow.
Where is he?
Probably at my parents'.
Well then... let's
go to your parents'.
No, I can't go to my parents'.
Why?
I'm the one that
put him in jail.
Okay, never mind.
It's not like I liked doing it.
He got mixed up with a lot
of really bad people.
And then he started...
He started using that shit. I
just had to get him out of there.
You know, ironically, a lot
of people become addicted...
...when they're in prison.
I think it's like...
...80%-85% of the inmates
require treatments.
I hate you.
Yeah, I know.
I'm sorry.
But I actually wasn't finished.
I was going to say...
Why can't you just be quiet?
What the F?
These are cloth.
They're nice.
I could have shot you!
Oh, I'm sorry, do you not like
someone invading your privacy?
Oh, come on. I glanced at your file.
You broke into my home!
I care about who
I'm working with, too.
And it's a little uncomfortable
that you feel the need
to travel with trophies.
It's not what you think.
They moved me up here,
rented this apartment,
and that is all my stuff.
These four shitty, sad boxes... this is it?
This is your life?
Yes.
Oh, God. I don't think that
could be any sadder if you...
...threw it all
in the trash bag
and started
dragging it behind you.
You use coffee filters for
toilet paper at your house.
I'm buying them anyway.
They have a dual purpose.
That's not what they're for.
Yeah, real fancy-pants.
I see it. I see it in here.
Looks like you were pretty
cool in high school, huh?
Yes. Yes, I was.
But what...
Because you weren't.
You know what that girl's not?
That girl's not cool.
My favorite part is you
only have two signatures...
...both by teachers.
Mrs. Burke said, "Have a good
summer." That's a personal touch.
My real favorite is this one.
"It'll get better."
Yes, fine.
Okay, now we're even.
Okay-
I see you have a cat.
Yep-
Is he around? Because I'd like
to, you know, pet him and stuff.
He... ran away, uh,
when I was in New York.
Oh, God, that
kind of tears me up.
Yeah, it was,
um... it was a loss.
That cat got one look
at your shitty life
and said,
"No fucking thanks, man...
am outta here!"
I'm still kind of just grieving
a little bit about it.
That fucking tabby is an
asshole, that's what he is.
FUCK you!
Yeah, "Fuck you!" That's what I
say to that cat. Goddamn it.
Such a shitty,
shitty little life.
You can't even keep a cat.
That hurts a little bit.
That's just the grief.
No, not the grief.
It's just the pounding
a little bit.
Oh. All right.
Don't be a dick about it.
Thank you for that.
All right, let's
hit the road, okay?
I've got to change.
What's the matter
with your pantsuit?
It's pajamas.
Well, excuse
the shit out of me,
I didn't realize you
slept in a fucking tux.
Go ahead, get your top hat.
MRS. MULLINS: This is the place where
you're supposed to be civilized!
MARK: Be a mother
for once in your life.
Oh, great. This asshole!
Just take it easy.
Hey, Pop.
Hey, pork Chop.
Well, well, well.
Look who it is!
The rat's back in the house. Did you
come back to arrest somebody else?
You know, I saw Ma throw a can of Diet
Coke in the garbage the other day.
She didn't recycle it!
Dad here, he's splicing cable
off the neighbors next door.
Come on now, Mark.
MARK: Maybe you should
fingerprint him.
Maybe get yourself
some stripes!
Petey here, how many songs
you download illegally
off the Internet? 5,000?
Ten, twenty thousand.
MARK: 20,000!
Mikey just stole
a laptop from his work!
Stole? I fucking worked there for six weeks.
I deserved to take it.
Exactly. No health insurance.
That balances out.
But not you... you'll probably
call in the SWAT team!
Actually, she could, because
those are horrible examples.
Here are the nuggies!
Here we go.
What kind of an animal throws
her own brother in jail?
This kind of animal... right here!
Shut up.
How about keeps him
from killing himself?
I was the only one that
got him off the street.
None of you fucks did!
You should never
arrest your family!
Who the fuck are you?
That's Gina!
Well, tell Gina I'm gonna
strangle her at the table!
She is my best friend! You touch
her, you gotta go through me first.
Who the fuck are you?
I'll kill you, and kill her
with your fucking dead body!
Everybody calm down.
Shannon's right.
This one has no business
chiming in on a family matter!
"This one?" Why are you talking
about my girlfriend like that?
She wears sweatpants
to your mother's dinner!
Those are her
classy sweatpants.
They don't say
"insert Here" on the ass.
Her ass is hanging out!
Look at her breasts
at the table!
Welcome home.
You here to arrest me?
I hope not.
You selling Bibles?
No, she's Ashburn.
Let's go.
We need to talk.
Sit down.
Uh, that is one
of the better...
...Jesus sports-themed
paintings I've seen.
It's very good. Nice.
What are you doing
at Club Ekko?
What are you, my mother?
How do you know I was there?
I know everything. Are you already
working for those guys again?
No, this guy Julian,
he sent for me
because he wants me
to start working with him.
But I told him no, I'm getting
a straight job, and it's fine.
Everybody's cool now.
We parted amicably.
Are you a knock?
I'm sorry?
Are you a knock?
A "knock"?
I'm sorry, I don't
know what that is.
GINA: A knock.
Am I speaking fucking Japanese?
Yeah, listen to him.
MICHAEL:
I'll sound it out for you.
Are you...
...or are you not...
...a knock?
A fucking knock!
Like Johnny Depp
in  Jump Street.
Ah, I see! Okay, a narc.
A knock, yes!
What was I saying?
I was missing the R. I heard
"knock", but apparently there's a C.
He said knock!
I said fucking knock, right?
Why are you wearing a long-sleeved flannel?
It's hot out.
I'm a little fluey.
It's nothing.
You want me to break that thumb?
Please, don't! No!
Mercy. Mercy. Mercy.
MULLINS: Straighten that arm.
It looks worse than it is. It's not a big deal.
This guy Julian...
...wants me to keep working.
They like me.
Tell me where I can
find Julian right now.
No. Just stay out of it.
They're maniacs. They'll chop you
up, or gun you down, or worse.
Jason, tell me
what you fucking know!
I don't know anything.
Okay. Sal Natale.
Okay?
You know Sal Natale?
Of course I do.
He was gonna steal
this huge shipment
they got coming in,
so they popped him.
He's in the trunk of his Caddy
under the Charles River Bridge.
I want you to stay
in this house.
If I catch you outside, I'll
hurt you worse than them.
PETER: What are you?
Why are you here?
I'm a federal agent.
I'm a Special Agent.
Special, like retarded?
We don't use that word.
We say "special needs".
But I have a very high IQ.
Are you a boy or a girl?
That's a fair question.
Uh, I'm... I'm female.
No kidding.
All woman!
From the get-go?
No operation?
Um...
From birth, yes.
How you get that close a shave
on your face?
I need to go, but I'll be back to, um...
PETER: Nice knowing you.
Yeah, thank you.
MULLINS: Yep, that's
Sal Natale, all right.
Bullet hole through the head. That's
unusually civilized for them.
Oh, they cut out his tongue, too.
Ah.
There you have it. They
like to send a message.
Did you find the tongue? Sure.
Shoved it up his anal cavity.
That's a weird message.
The tip of the tongue was
sticking out of the rectum.
So it made it appear
as if his buttocks
were giving the police
the raspberry.
Did they draw googly eyes or
anything on his butt cheeks?
No.
Seems like kind of an opportunity missed.
That would have been funny.
Well, I feel that they were just
trying to be tongue in cheek.
God, don't do that.
Where are his belongings?
Any clues as to where
the body was killed?
We're still looking
for their base camp.
Well, if there's
anything on him
that will tell us,
I will find it.
ASHBURN: Huh. MULLINS:
Is that coke?
I don't think so.
It's more like a coating.
Same traces found
on all the victims' shoes.
All of them had...
Epoxy powder coating.
Right?
That's right.
Each sample was made of the same ingredient.
Which means...
They were all
killed same place.
Exactly.
I checked it out Wow.
There are three places that
have this kind of powder.
Paint factory!
Yeah.
We all know that.
Well, it's...
Look at this.
This one right here is
centered in the location...
Where all four dead
bodies were found!
Right.
That's what I thought.
This one shut down years ago,
owned by a man by
the name of Lief Sa...
Sambertineson?
Sagglemint?
Samber...?
Old Sagglemint.
Santino.
Oh, Santino!
Santino... Sanfino.
Is that a derivative
of Sagglemint?
Get me the address
to that paint factory ASAP.
Excuse me, Ashburn? Um...
I was wondering...
Oh. This
is a little awkward.
Uh, it's nothing personal, but
as a rule I make it a point...
...not to date my
co-workers, so... thank you.
I was wondering if you would
not talk to me in that tone.
Oh! Yes, of course!
That's a little different.
I wouldn't.
Why would I?
Why would you? Really.
We should go to
the paint factory.
Are we clear here? Because
it got real awkward.
No... I think we're all good.
Right?
Uh... ASHBURN:
We're really good.
Same page.
Because I don't want any bad...
ASHBURN: We're all good.
Here we go.
Let's go to the paint factory.
She doesn't want to date
co-workers, so spread the word.
Shut up.
Caught my man cheating Now I'm
rolling through the west side
'Bout to burn this fucking
house down like I'm Left Eye
'Bout to burn this motherfucker
down like I'm Left Eye
Heard my man is cheating with
another bitch at my house
What is that shit?
Stop it.
Just cover
me and go right.
Well, then say that.
You make me want to shoot you.
JULIAN: I don't know what your
problem is, but we told you...
stay out of the city.
I don't know what it is. Are you deaf?
Do you not speak English?
I got to do something
with you, man.
Look, Jullian...
I'm sorry.
I'll sell for you guys.
Whatever you want me to do.
I'm just trying to
make some extra money.
You can't blame
me for that, right?
Relax.
I totally get it.
Thank you. I'm not
gonna shoot you.
Okay. It's cool, man. Thanks.
He is.
Wait! Hold on!
Shit!
If we grab Julian,
I can get into his head.
We'll have Larkin by tonight.
Two against two.
I like those odds.
I'll call for backup.
It's already here.
Oh, hey!
I was looking for you. Um, I
forgot to get your number.
Cool. It's, uh,
That's, uh...
too many numbers.
I met these disasters at
the club the other night.
Now they're both here.
You think you
might have been bugged?
Give me a break.
What the fuck?
Think you're hot shit?
Guess what.
You guys look even
older in this lighting!
Come on.
Fuck you.
Fuck you! It's not fuck me.
It's fuck you.
You know why? Because I'm
about to fuck you up.
Pick it up.
Do it. Give me a reason
to shoot you in the face.
How long will this take?
Maybe 12 hours, hopefully less.
I have to find out
what drives him.
We could just beat him
with a phonebook.
No! For so many
reasons, no.
You just need to be
patient, all right?
It is crucial that
you remain patient.
It's also crucial that you stop
wearing this stupid barrette.
Don't! Just leave it.
Why? You have one on your head.
Yeah, on top of my head,
like a normal person.
What is the difference?
Just move on.
If you enter that room, you could
break the bond we have created.
Okay? Just please, please
trust me on this one.
Do you understand
how important this is?
Yeah, I do.
And you will be patient?
I will.
Okay. All right.
Hello.
Coffee?
I drink a little more coffee
than I probably should.
Where's Larkin?
You couldn't wait ten seconds?
What's so funny?
You... thinking you're
going to make me talk.
You're talking
right now, dumb-ass!
You look like one of
the Campbell's soup kids
who grew up and
became an alcoholic.
Oh, surprisingly catty.
You're a fucking genius.
I asked
you to stay outside!
I need to
go tough on him.
Are you not already doing that?
No! I'm doing
good cop, bad cop.
You know, I can hear you.
Shut up!
Just please,
don't do anything crazy.
I won't do anything crazy.
What am I gonna do that's crazy?
I'm a police officer. Huh?
Am I gonna
shoot you in the dick?
You said nothing crazy,
and that is a no-no!
No-no!
Turn around. I need you
to pass a polygraph.
Put it away!
Turn around!
Don't worry, she won't do it.
She won't do anything.
So you want to gamble with your
scrotum and your testicles?
Okay, gamble away!
Just go to the corner!
I'm in it!
I'll tell you what we're gonna do...
play a little game.
I'm gonna take
out these bullets.
Except this one. Because
this is my favorite.
I'm gonna keep that in there.
And then you're gonna
tell me where Larkin is.
And you're gonna
tell me when and where
that shipment is coming in.
Okay?
Right now.
I'm gonna kill you
and everyone you know.
That's not what I asked.
Straight arrow,
take the gun from her!
Now you want me to
save your scrotum?
When is the shipment coming in?
I don't know.
Ah!
All right! There's a
shipment on Wednesday!
Where?
I don't know!
I swear
to God, I don't know!
Tell her! Just tell
her where it is!
Don't shoot me in the dick!
I don't know! It's gonna be Wednesday!
That's four shots!
Don't take any more shots!
Just tell her
where it's coming in!
I don't know! Don't
shoot me in the dick!
Enough! Stop it!
You brought
Julian and LeSoire in?
You out of your minds?
Wasn't too smart.
Oh. So you're not supposed
to arrest someone
when they commit murder
and try and kill you?
You wanted us to
keep them on the street?
You shouldn't
even have been there!
Larkin is the big catch,
not those two!
Now we're never
gonna be able to...
Craig! Calm down!
We can all hear you.
Yeah, dogs can hear you.
Of course dogs can hear me!
Are you okay? Because
you look really pale.
It's a genetic condition!
Ashburn, come here.
Fucking snow cone.
CRAIG: Oh, I get it! That's a good
one because I'm really white!
Can I have a moment
with my agent, please?
I'm good.
All right. I'm gonna
be right over there.
Right there.
Thank you.
Why didn't you alert anyone
once you found evidence
of Julian's whereabouts?
It was an unconfirmed lead.
I wasn't gonna waste anyone's
time until I knew it was real.
Give it a rest. I want
you to stand down...
...while I figure out how to
repair all this shit with the DEA.
Sir, no, please.
I swear I've been doing
everything you sent
me out here to do.
We've been doing
such good work.
I know you are.
It's just...
I don't know, it's... never
easy when you are involved.
Fuck that guy.
If you're not in trouble,
you're not doing your job.
Yeah.
We should go get a drink. Right?
What's the point of being a cop
if you can't get one drink
at the end of the night?
That's what I'm talking about!
I said I just want one.
Oh, no, no, here...
it is one.
Sometimes he just likes
to do this thing where...
...he pours them in three
little glasses, but it's one.
All right, here we go!
Let's loosen that up.
Okey-dokey.
There you go.
There you go. Keep a pace.
Okay.
Don't spit that shit out.
It's not free.
Let's go.
Keep that in.
Ooh.
Hey, how you doing?
I haven't heard from you.
Shit.
No, you haven't.
Well, did I do
something wrong, or...
Okay, here we go.
It's not you, it's me.
Uh, I'm still
working on myself.
So I can't be a part of two
until I'm a better one.
You don't have to do that.
Oh, wait.
My favorite's coming.
Oh.
You make me want to
be a better woman.
I thought we had a good time.
We did have a lot of fun.
And now we're gonna move on.
Let it go.
All right. Cool.
No hard feelings, right?
Okay, hit it.
Hit it.
Bye.
I didn't know how else to say it.
It's pretty clear.
That's why you
don't feed strays.
Can we get two more...
...shots?
Six.
MULLINS: We should get a
few more of these, right?
ASHBURN: I don't know, Mullins.
It's hard.
I know we're not
supposed to say this,
but being a woman
in this field is hard.
Men are just so intimidated
by me, which is like... why?
And then you put your personality
on top of that and it is...
...it is off-putting.
You know, I was actually
married for six some years.
Was he a hearing man?
Yes.
He didn't understand how
much the job meant to me,
so I thought it'd
be best to just...
...be alone rather than
to compromise the work.
I get that.
It's kind of weird that it does
get lonely... a little bit.
It's hard to
make female friends.
I hung out, you know...
...really just with my brothers
and stuff growing up and...
...they just all turned out
to be terrible people.
So that's kind of a bummer.
Your family loves you.
I mean,
in their own unique way,
but they love you and
that's a wonderful...
Very unique.
That sounds like
it's coming from
somebody
that's an only child.
No, I was actually raised
with a lot of children.
Other children?
What, in a circus?
No, just in...
in the houses.
Oh, my God.
You're a foster kid.
Yes, I was.
Oh, my God.
No. Jesus, that clears up a lot.
Foster kid. That makes sense.
That's a tough go of it.
No, it was totally fine.
There was a lot of benefits
to being a foster kid.
Yeah?
Yeah.
On Christmases, there was
this local drugstore
that would sponsor us and give us
little baggies of toiletries and stuff.
On Thanksgiving, we would hit these
different putt putt golf courses.
You'd meet all kinds of...
Other sad kids?
No...
Oh, Jesus.
That's the saddest series
of images I've ever heard.
I don't think it affected me in
the long run at all. At all.
You're probably fine.
I can see how maybe it was, like, a
little bit, but not anything that's...
Maybe it has?
Oh, God.
Oh, God, my life!
Oh, God.
All right. Let it
out, that's it.
Good for you to start
working through it.
I don't feel well.
I don't feel well.
You're not
making me feel great.
All right...
blow it out.
Really let it go.
You've got more than that.
Oh!
Good job!
I don't feel well.
Do you want some Jéger?
Two Jégers!
MULLINS:
Let's hear it!
Whoo!
This is for you!
The chills that you spill
Up my back keep me filled
With satisfaction
when we're done
Sex walk!
Look at it!
Look at it!
Look at it.
Giving it to you!
Higher.
My name...
...is Detective Mullins.
You'd better lay your ass down.
I smell bacon.
I smell bacon.
I smell bacon.
Ooh! Ooh!
Ooh! Ooh!
Biscuits are done!
Let's do it again!
No! Stop playing this song!
Why? Because you played
it 26 fucking times.
Hey! She's a foster kid. Yeah.
She had Q-tips and tampons
and shit for Christmas.
She's had a horrible,
fucking miserable life.
Look at her!
Yeah!
All right.
Play the goddamn song.
Don't you fucking swear at us.
Yes, you celebrate your music.
Okay.
Everybody, get up!
Come dance!
Come on!
Get up, you fuck!
Get on!
Look, it's a frenzy.
We started a frenzy.
You're covered in nuts.
You've having a bad dream.
You're covered in nuts.
Let's give them a little something...
Hold still.
Spin me around
till I fell asleep
Then up the stairs
he would carry me
Girl you're every woman
in the world to me
I love this place.
Hey, to this...
to this place.
Ah.
Ah.
I don't feel it.
Keep ii UP-
Girl you're every woman
in the world to me
Oh, crap.
Oh!
Hey, how long
have we been here?
Oh, crap.
Okay, focus.
You know what? Here's this.
This counts as something.
That's it.
I'm all in.
Hey, how's it going?
Jesus, you've got to get
a mint in that dumpster.
Oh, God. Was I smoking
cigarettes last night?
Yeah, you kept taking them out of
people's mouths and smoking them.
God, that's so nasty!
It was pretty gross.
Why is my jacket in the pot?
Don't worry.
I'll get it right back.
Let's see what you got.
Oh, shit.
That's great.
Good evening.
That's great.
There you go.
I didn't think you'd care
that much about your jacket.
You didn't care at all when
you gave away your car.
Who did I give it to? To Wayne!
Who's Wayne?
Wayne! He just
walked out of here!
You were sitting
in his lap all night.
You had your
tongue down his throat.
Oh, God! It feels like we've been hibernating!
Didn't bother you last night.
Oh, Jesus, ten missed messages.
Will you get him, please?
Wayne, Ashburn wants
her underwear back!
I do not! You cannot take that car!
It's government property.
Oh, yeah? Well, I pay taxes,
so fuck the government!
Let's not, okay?
Get out of the car,
you asshole!
Oh, God.
Oh, my God!
Oh, shit! Wayne!
God, your first boyfriend.
You two were electric.
How did Julian escape?
Federal marshals transferring
him got ambushed.
We're not sure whether Larkin's
men followed the marshals
or got information
from the inside.
Isn't it obvious?
FUCK you!
I know when I smell
a fucking albino rat.
If you want to point a finger,
why don't you point it
at yourself?
If you two hadn't
brought Julian in,
Larkin would have never
known we were on to him!
And this whole case
wouldn't be the giant mixed-up
bucket of shit that it is now.
So fuck you and
your albino prejudice!
Now Larkin knows who you are,
and Julian's angry as shit.
If I were you,
I would get out of town.
You'd like that, wouldn't you?
Ashburn, he's right.
This isn't a choice.
No way!
You're not my boss, Puss in Boots.
And even if you were...
...you still
couldn't stop me.
I have more invested in this
case than any of you assholes.
And now you fucked it up!
That's another fucked-up area of my life.
Thanks for bringing it up.
No, this was just
emailed to me.
Okay, fine. I guess
I'm out of line, huh.
I'll step back and see
what you assholes can do.
Go U.S.A. Let's go.
We got to get my family out.
They're gonna kill them.
I'll talk to Hale. The FBI
can arrange everything.
Are you kidding?
We got a mole in there.
I'm assuming it's the
albino, but we don't know.
It could be Levy.
It could be somebody
from my precinct.
It could be your boss,
Puss in Boots.
We are going in there by
ourselves and doing it now.
Are you with me or not?
Okay.
This is bullshit!
Why should we uproot our lives
because you're an asshole?
Don't talk to her like that.
It's not her fault.
You want to bring everyone?
No, but it'd be
like Schindler's List.
Dad! Come on, we cannot
fit that in the car!
I don't want them
to take my treasures.
No, no, no!
I thought you were inside.
Say bye-We-
Say bye-bye. No. I'll call
you when I get there.
You are so rude.
I know. I'm so sorry.
This is my house!
Just go outside.
Where are you going? Outside!
I'll be right back
I can see through your shirt.
Oh, God, are you serious?
Oh, my God.
What are you doing
with the bat?
Just let 'em try to come over here, Shan.
Just let 'em try.
They're not gonna
throw soft balls at you.
They're gonna shoot you, moron.
Get your bag.
Would you get over yourself
for Christ's sake?
Bring it on, motherfuckers.
Not you, Mrs. Amendola.
Hi. Can I drive?
No, but if you could
make your way around...
Get out and let me drive.
I'm a really good driver!
Mullins! Your mom.
Our lives are in danger. I
may have to change my name.
So if you get a call from
someone named Carla, it's me!
When did you become
such a princess?
MULLINS:
You make it impossible!
All right, seatbelts, everyone!
Come on, buddy...
come on.
Right here, buddy!
Right here!
What the fuck is this?
That's my puppy. I got
him four months ago.
I named him Kevin Garnett.
You're an asshole!
You gotta see
the cock on this thing.
Move. We're not bringing this
fucking horse to a motel.
We gotta get Gina.
For what?
Because you put her
fucking life in danger!
Nobody gives a shit about her.
If I'm going, Gina's going!
I'm not going
unless we get Gina.
Just get in.
We're getting Gina.
Move your feet,
I'll chop 'em off!
We're going to Gina's!
MULLINS: I hope a truck
hits us and we all die.
What the fuck is
this girl doing?
Could she go any slower? Could
she physically go slower?
MRS. MULLINS:
Go get your girlfriend.
PETER:
She's fine, Ma!
I forgot my curling
iron, Mrs. Mullins!
Come on, Gina, get in the car!
What the fuck?
I got you the rollie so you could roll the bag!
So get over here!
You kidding?
You bought me
a bag for Christmas
so that I could
carry my own luggage?
Gina, come on...
let's go.
I'm gonna get you
a dick-sucker for Christmas
so I don't have to
do it no more.
MRS. MULLINS: Go get her!
Jesus! I'm going!
Gina! You really
didn't say that.
Oh, that's why you're here.
MRS. MULLINS:
Go get her.
Come on, Pete, just break
up with this girl!
Let's go, let's go!
You're making a scene,
you assholes!
You think you're man enough?
You fucking man enough?
Knock it off!
Just knock it off!
I got this!
Hey! Assholes!
Get in the car! Get in the car!
Get in the car!
Did she just pull out a gun?
You know what happens now?
You don't get this one!
So, Jason,
your family seems nice.
Yeah, we have our good days.
My make-up is
in that one.
I'll rip your pants off!
If we just knew where that
shipment was coming to,
we would have
Larkin and Julian.
They would both be there,
and we could get them.
I'm just happy that Jason
is out of there for now.
Yeah.
Shame, though.
Having your brother on the
inside would be a coup for us.
That's what you want to say?
Because you're
saying that out loud.
You would say exactly the same
thing if it wasn't your brother.
We're done talking about this.
So if it was just
some random drug dealer,
you wouldn't send him back in?
If it was someone like Rojas
We're not talking about Rojas.
We're talking about my
brother, you fuckwit.
We all have a lot to lose
if we don't catch Larkin.
What do you have to lose?
I have a lot.
Some bullshit promotion?
You don't give
a shit about my family
or if Jason gets out
there and gets killed.
I feel you're not being honest.
Because nobody forced your brother
to get involved with drugs.
You're an asshole for that.
Okay, that's not
helping, either.
I'm trying to
create a dialogue.
Note that I start my
statements with "I feel".
Oh, I feel like
you're an asshole.
You know what I feel?
I feel that you have worn that
shirt every day this week.
And I feel that you
turning it inside out
does not make it a new shirt.
Well, I feel like it does
Oh, really? Well, I
feel I disagree.
Must be nice.
What?
Must be really nice
for you to know everything.
To be so much smarter
than everybody else.
I don't profess to know everything,
but I do know quite a bit.
What I know is accurate
and scientifically proven,
and I share that
information with you.
If you have
a problem with that,
tune me out like you always do.
WOMAN:
Help! He's choking!
Okay, I've got it.
Somebody call an ambulance!
Check his mouth!
There's nothing there!
Okay, lay him down.
Sir, relax.
Everything will be fine.
Let me get his head back.
He's choking. I need a
knife and a straw, please!
A knife and a straw!
Why a knife and a straw?
I'm going to perform
an emergency tracheotomy.
I'll need a glass of vodka.
Vodka! It's a Denny's!
For sterilization.
Hot water!
Do you know what you're doing?
Technically, no...
...but I've been
doing some research
and I feel fairly
confident I know how.
He's still choking!
Sir, what I'm going
to do is find your...
Please don't put that in there.
Shh. Stop touching me.
I think the cricothyroid membrane is here.
I'll make a small incision...
Let go of my hand.
Please don't do that.
I'm going to make
a small incision.
The reason I'm doing this...
is because you're choking.
I'm gonna cut in... just a
little bigger...
That goes in
deeper than I thought.
Now I'm going to
insert my fingers.
Don't put your finger in there!
There is the membrane.
It's a fucking horror show! Don't
put your fingers in there!
Sir, what I'm going to do is
insert the straw in the hole...
...and it will allow the
oxygen to get to your brain.
In one moment, you will feel the
oxygen flow into your brain.
That's not oxygen.
That's not oxygen!
That's a lot of blood.
Oh, my God,
there's so much blood!
I don't know what I'm doing!
Stop crying!
You did this!
When's the ambulance coming?
I got it! Move!
I'm so sorry
So much blood!
You asshole!
You probably
could have just pulled
the piece of pancake
out of his throat.
He's alive, isn't he?
I have a cut on my arm
from earlier.
Do you think I
should amputate it?
You know you're
not a real doctor?
Neither are you.
Bye-bye! You're a
reckless person.
Thank you.
Not you.
Oh, my God.
Ashburn.
Why don't you
have your own phone?
Who am I, the Queen of England?
I don't know. Does the Queen of
England only wear sweatpants?
Fuck you.
You F you.
This is Mullins.
Shannon, I left. I couldn't
sit there anymore.
What? Where are you?
I talked to them and everything's fine.
Nothing's weird, we're good.
It doesn't work
that way, Jason.
They know you're my brother.
But they also
know you arrested me
and that made it seem
like I hated you.
No, it doesn't work that way.
Shut up for a minute!
Look, I know where the
shipment's going to.
I don't give a shit
about the shipment!
Just get your
ass back here now.
I'm gonna stick around or
they'll know something's weird.
Get off me!
It's my phone.
Trust me, I'm trying
to do the right thing.
Are you kidding me?
Jason! Jason!
Let go of my vest!
Shannon?
It's Ashburn. What the
fuck is going on?
What have you got?
Don't talk to her!
The shipment's coming to the Boston
Harbor Shipyard at 11 o'clock.
big freight, tons of guys.
They'll be heavily armed. You
got to be careful, you hear me?
The ship is called the S.S.
Tank or something like that.
I promise we'll be there.
I got to go.
I'll break your fucking arm!
Okay, take it easy!
Just take it easy!
Shit!
You just made my
brother a dead man!
No, he's gonna be fine.
Mullins, I swear he'll be fine.
We're gonna have
the full power of...
...the Boston FBI down on that
terminal tonight, I promise you.
He'll be fine.
It really is a good thing.
You'll thank me.
Shut up!
ASHBURN: All right. SWAT TEAM
LEADER: The  coming in.
Okay, here we go.
FBI! Get your fucking hands in the air now!
Let's see 'em!
Boat's clean.
It's not clean. We found a
joint in that girl's purse.
Oh, now...
this is really a mess.
Sir, we just have to
hit the streets again.
And if the shipment came in...
Ashburn, enough.
It's over.
I'm sending you
back to New York.
Sir, no, please!
I'm telling you, I'm so close.
This was just a little hiccup.
It wasn't a hiccup.
Lo siento.
Don't.
Don't even...
Oh, God.
Um, sorry. Detective Mullins.
Have you seen her?
Hospital. Some kind
of family emergency.
Oh, God.
He's in an induced coma.
They shot him and left
him out in the street.
I'm so sorry, Mullins.
I'm sorry.
He was trying to move on.
He had a job interview.
I saw the resume.
It was a terrible resume.
He mentioned prison and...
...in Special Skills he said,
"Keeping it real", but...
...he was trying.
How's your family holding up?
They're not talking to me.
Blame me now more than ever.
It's not your fault.
Yes, it is.
Damn it, I should have
handled it by myself!
So that's it?
I'm not your partner anymore?
No, you're not. You're another
fucking disappointment.
I want you to know that I'm gonna
find the man responsible for this.
Hey, Shannon.
GINA: Uh, that was wicked rude.
You can walk along
a crowded street
But the city
really ain't no bigger
Police!
Put your hands up!
Really?
But it don't do too
much good to be talkin'
I'll give these back to you.
Thank you so much
for your help.
Anytime.
We're gonna miss
you around here.
Oh, I don't think so.
I might.
You did a good job out there.
Just keep your fingers out of guys' necks.
It's nasty.
Bye.
HALE: We sent out alerts
to airports, train stations.
DEA's gonna take
the lead on this one.
Although this is
a joint task force,
we're also working
with the Boston P.D.
Adam and I will be handpicking
all the officers so we
don't wind up with this.
Any questions?
That's not right.
No, it's not.
That officer you're making fun
of and all laughing at...
...has more integrity,
commitment,
courage and guts than
anybody in this room.
Yeah... but less
mental stability.
So just to be clear,
what does mental
instability look like?
Keeping people safe?
Protecting the community?
Getting the job done?
Is that what it looks like?
Then great.
If that's what it looks like,
sign me up for the crazy house!
That officer right there...
...is a better law enforcement
officer than anybody in this room.
Myself included. She is better than
you, she is better than you...
...and she is definitely
better than you.
What are you doing? Are you texting?
Playing a game?
What is it? Put it away!
God, you guys!
What is the matter with you?
You're just such jerks!
You're just such...
You're just a shit-jerk! You're
just a shit-jerk dick... fucker!
You're a shit-jerk
dick-fucker assholer!
And you just go
fuck yourselves!
Sorry, senor, not you.
Pardon, please.
Just... all you fuckers!
Get on the ground!
You are under arrest!
Put your hands up and tell me where
the fuck Larkin is!
I think it'd be much more better
if you put your hands up.
ASHBURN:
"Much more better?"
Drop the gun and take a
grammar course, you idiot.
Who the fuck are you?
Me and her...
...we're the fucking heat.
All right... we've got some
scumbags to visit, huh?
Yeah, we do.
Get up, asshole!
Let's go.
Where's Larkin?
I don't even know who that is.
Where is he?
I don't know who
the fuck that is!
ASHBURN: Really? It's clean?
You not finding anything?
Nothing in here?
Okay, hold on a second.
How about this? Right there!
Right there!
MULLINS: Got your pizza!
Got your pizza, mister!
Fresh hot pizza!
ASHBURN: Get on your knees!
Where's your stash?
I don't have anything yet.
I'm waiting to get some
from a new distributor.
Who's your new distributor?
Oh, shit, man!
Guess who.
Surprise.
Come on, man!
I don't know what y'all are doing here!
I'm out of the game.
You know what I hate? Drugs.
I'm a different man!
This is not mine.
I just bought that
refrigerator the other day.
This must have been in there.
We want to know
where all this new shit
is coming from.
Where is Larkin?
Bitch, what part of "I'm out"
do you not understand? I'm out!
You want to interview him?
No. No. I think I have
something better in mind.
Oh, shit! I don't know shit!
Come on!
MULLINS: I don't know, you're
getting awfully heavy, Rojas.
Yeah, lie to me again.
I want to feel your body sliding
through my delicate hands.
I don't know shit!
Whoa, I can't hold you!
ROJAS: No,
I don't want to die!
I don't want to die!
Okay! It's at a warehouse!
On Summer Street!
I'm almost disappointed.
Get me up!
Let's pull him up.
No, I'm not kidding.
I can't lift him up.
I can't lift him!
I've only done this
one other time
and it was
a really tiny hooker.
Lift my ass up!
You ain't putting
nobody over no rails
you can't fucking
lift them out!
Okay, okay!
Uh... Just tuck your head
and relax your body.
Lady, what the fuck?
Crap! Crap!
Get me up!
Thank you again!
Thank you!
That was on me.
I take that.
I hope this ain't my car.
This is my car?
On, shit! My 200s!
Let's load up.
I'm ready to dance
when the vamp up
And when I hit that dip,
get your camera
No, no, no!
Yes, yes.
You said that thing ticks.
But not for days.
The bitch who wants
to compete and
I could freak a 'fit,
that pump with the peep and
You know what your bitch
become when her weave in
I just wanna sip that punch
with your peeps and
Sit in that lunch
if you're treating
Kick it with your bitch
who come from Parisian
She know where I get mine
from, and the season
You hungry? I got a
sandwich I didn't finish.
Is that the same sandwich
you offered me a week ago?
It's cheese.
Cheese doesn't go bad.
I heard you're riding with
the same tall, tall tale
Telling them you made some
Made some
Saying you're grinding
but you ain't going nowhere
Bitch, the end
of your lives are near
Bitch, the end
of your lives are near
Baby formula.
Cartels have been smuggling
cocaine in baby formula for years.
Two of them, two of us.
I like those odds.
Boston P.D.!
FBI!
Get down on the ground!
ASHBURN: That's right,
that's how we roll. Come on.
You guys are all coming back
from break at the same time?
Unfortunate.
You guys get less attractive
every time I see you.
Put the fucking guns down.
No, thanks.
Nice entrance, Teen Wolf.
You look like a Ninja Turtle.
Take it easy.
I've held someone at gunpoint
for  hours before.
Let's go.
We need to do what he says.
What?
It's the best thing.
We gonna shoot our way out of this?
Put the gun in the bag.
No, hold your gun up.
Give them the bag,
give them everything!
Goddamn you. I thought
you had my back.
Put it in the bag
and slide it over, now.
It's in the bag!
Slide the bag over!
Sorry.
I guess you and her
are engaged now, huh?
What?
Well, because“.
...you just gave me
a ring, motherfucker!
Oh, shit!
Shit.
Oh, God.
No, stop, stop!
Okay, that feels broken.
MULLINS: Pull it out.
It's out!
Nice work.
How many of you are there?
Really!
How funny.
This is like when you were interrogating
me, only now you're tied up...
...and I've got
all these knives.
You know, I don't
like to shoot people.
I like cutting people up.
It's kind of what I do.
I like that one.
That's a good small one.
Good choice, it's small.
You like this?
Not too flashy.
This is actually
an oyster shucking knife.
Either of you ladies
need your oyster shucked?
Not at the moment.
Not me.
I got to tell you,
I've done this
a lot of times
to a lot of people...
...but you two, you're
gonna be the most fun.
What?
Larkin's here.
Larkin.
Upstairs.
This fun will have to wait.
The boss is here.
Can you please excuse
me a second, ladies?
Sure, take what time you need.
Yeah, take your time.
Okay, cool.
Oh, also, um...
...would you mind
holding this for me?
Well, my hands are tied,
but I can certainly try.
Okay, let me help you.
Jesus!
Thanks
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
Shit!
Breathe through the pain...
Yeah, do that.
Do that, do that.
Breathe it out, breathe it out.
Okay, Mullins.
If we should perish...
We're not gonna.
Just shh!
I know I'm not very
good with my feelings...
...but I need to
tell you something.
You are smart.
You are smart and
you are intuitive.
And you're the best cop
I've ever worked with.
You, too, thank you.
You were right. I went back and
looked at the evidence and...
...I think the Red Falls
Killer is innocent
Did you happen to
mention that to anybody
before you put yourself in a
life-threatening situation?
No, I didn't!
Jesus! Good luck... you're taking
that to your grave probably.
Fuck, the other leg!
Fuck, the other leg!
You can move your chair,
too, you know.
I am moving my chair.
Just grab the knife.
Take it!
Just take it!
MULLINS: I'm sorry.
got it! Shit!
Shut up.
Shut up. Shut up.
Just come on, all right?
I am doing it as fast as I can.
It's almost there.
Got it!
Hurry up, hurry UP-
Hurry up.
What?
Somebody's coming up.
Got to put it back in. What?
I got to put it back in.
And I'll put my hands
behind my back.
When he gets close,
I'll grab him.
But you got to shut up
and let me put it back in.
Okay, just put it in.
What are you doing?
Sorry, it doesn't
go in that easy.
Just shut up!
Motherfucker!
I'm sorry. Oh, shit.
I'll pretend to
keep my hands tied.
Shut up, shut up.
Oh, no, Scoob! Velma and
Daphne got captured!
I never thought I'd
be happy to see you guys.
We got to get her
to the hospital.
Did you guys call this in?
Yeah, I sent a fucking
owl with a note.
How did you even
know we were here?
We followed you.
I knew you wouldn't
give up easily,
especially not after they
greased your shitbag brother.
Fuck you. It takes a lot more than
Larkin to take down a Mullins.
Jason's not dead?
Come on, Adam.
Larkin is on his way.
What is this, a Q and A?
Can we do this later?
Wait. Did he talk to the police?
Did he see Larkin?
How is she supposed to know? He's
been in a coma. Untie my leg.
That's too bad. Where is he?
Is he at Boston General?
Why? You gonna send
him fucking flowers?
ASHBURN:
Why are you so...?
Oh, my God.
You piece of shit.
You guys are
working with Larkin.
I really wish you
hadn't said that.
Said What?
Oh, God!
Shit!
That felt good!
It wasn't the albino.
I feel bad.
He wasn't working for Larkin.
He just wanted you off the case
'cause he's
a misogynistic asshole.
Why are you doing this? You
getting some kind of payoff?
I was in the beginning.
Six years dealing
with these lowlifes,
making shit money...
Ah!
You're Larkin.
Holy shit.
Ta-da!
Get it? Right?
Makes perfect sense!
Now I'm bragging, but it's very
nice having a second income.
I heard shots.
What the...?
Aw, the albino.
That guy was hilarious!
Boss, I don't think that
was such a good idea.
You spend three years in a van
with him, you'd kill him, too.
We'll pin it on LeSoire.
I've got to go to the
hospital to finish Jason.
You deal with these two. No loose ends.
Mmm-hmm.
You fucking rat.
We told you to stay out of the way.
Good-bye.
You fucking rat!
See you, buddy.
Don't call me buddy.
He's actually a great guy.
All right...
...let's have some fun.
I've been waiting to
do this a long time.
Campbell soup, you're up first.
Please don't hurt us.
Please. I didn't mean
to say the shit I said.
Don't hurt us.
Mullins, gun at two-thirty!
Get it!
Don't!
You take one step
and your partner gets it.
Oh!
Oh, shit.
Nice.
Oh, God!
Look at me.
Are you okay?
I think I'm gonna throw up.
That was
a really bad head-butt.
It was good... but
you're gonna feel it.
Go!
Get yourself untied.
Then we're gonna go
get Jason. Got it?
MULLINS: Why won't they
answer the fucking phone?
ASHBURN: Go, go, go!
Oh, dick-fucker!
Get off the fucking phone!
Useless!
NURSE: We got something!
I got it.
Get her on the stretcher.
No, I got it. I got it!
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Wow, crap.
Here we go. Oh, crap.
All right. Got to turn.
Call 911!
You won't shoot me?
Just call it!
Where is my brother,
you asshole?
It's that kind of language
from your family
that forced us to move
him to the east wing.
Move, dipshit!
Jason, I'm coming!
What the fuck?
Come on, come on.
This stupid chair!
Screw it.
It's amazing what a little air
in the bloodstream
does to the human heart.
You may not want to watch this.
Wait!
I just want you to know
that I get it.
I get it. I mean...
...I've been on the job
a long time and...
...you just see so many bad
things and bad people and...
...you just start to wonder if
there's anybody good anymore and...
...I just want you to know that
you don't have to do this.
You don't have to do it.
I know.
But I do.
Because I have plans
that don't involve
me going to prison
with people I put there.
So say good-bye
to your mick brother.
MULLINS: Wait!
Drop it or I'll
fire this weapon!
Or I inject...
Oh, you shot him in the dick!
Twice.
Oh, shit!
I took a page right out
of your book, partner
But I've never done it.
I just aim it at it. I don't actually do it.
That's too fucking crazy.
What about Julian?
I take the bullets out!
I just use it as a tactic to scare him.
I mean, Jesus, I'm not crazy!
Don't make me
feel bad about it!
No, I know.
Ooh, watch that leg.
You did good, little buddy.
You saved my brother's life.
Internal Affairs is going to open
a top-to-bottom investigation
of every department now.
Nice work.
Well, it was
a team effort, sir.
Yeah, we put out
an APB on Julian.
Oh, don't bother,
he's in the trunk.
Oh, and, sir...
...we're going to have to reopen
the Red Falls Killer case.
Good for you.
I thought that would feel
good, but it felt awful.
MULLINS: That's probably
gonna just keep feeling bad.
But I'm glad you did it.
ASHBURN: Should we be
leaving the hospital?
MULLINS: Oh, shit. No.
Probably not.
Probably not. Spin it.
Let's take this one.
Get up here.
Is that clean?
It's clean enough.
Oh, my God! It smells like
several people died on here.
Let me just sit. I don't
need to be on my face!
You can
help the process.
Not clean!
Inchworm it up.
Okay, that's good.
Just flip me.
Get off the leg,
get off the leg.
Don't fall off!
I want this place
locked down, people!
Nobody goes in or out
without talking to me!
I want you three stationed at each
end of the east wing. Let's go!
Let's clear
this hallway, people!
Get the press out of here.
You Okay?
Yeah, yeah, I'm good.
Yeah, I knew you would be.
I'm good, too.
Excuse me.
This woman is one of the
best agents in the FBI.
Make sure she's well taken care of.
All right?
That was...
That was interesting, right?
I would look into that.
What is that?
All right, let's go.
You actually have to stay here.
Well, just do what you
can to save that leg.
Oh, I'm not a doctor.
All right, fucktard,
I know you're not a doctor.
But tell it to the doctor!
How about that?
All right! I'll wait
right here for you!
Throw out that sandwich!
I'll bring you that sandwich!
No! Throw it out!
You got it, buddy.
CAPTAIN WOODS:
For outstanding service...
...Officer Shannon Mullins.
There you go, Shannon! That's
what I'm talking about!
Now hold it up!
Hold it up! Yeah!
Take out the gun!
MARK:
a
I move to
cake-toast to Jason!
Yeah! To Jason!
May I have your attention?
I wanted you to have this.
It was your grandmother's.
She would have been
very proud of you
for taking care
of your brother.
That's awesome.
Take a picture.
Take a picture!
Come on, take a picture!
JASON: Are you serious?
"Dunkin' Jesus"?
No cell phones.
How about now?
Oh, different story?
Aw, come on back!
So, you getting all
settled in your new digs?
Yeah, they're pretty sweet. Who
needed that promotion anyway?
I'm glad I stayed around
where all the action is.
We got a lot of scumbags
to take down here in Boston.
Yeah, we do.
Hey... did you get
that package I sent?
Oh, I haven't opened
it yet I'm sorry.
Your dad sent me
something, too.
So it's like
the Mullins gift day.
Oh. Okay.
I signed it in the front.
Does that mean you broke
into my house again?
Maybe, maybe not.
Amazing how that door
opens all by itself.
I see it. Very funny.
I know. I was just kidding.
Look at the back.
Oh, you wrote something
else mean and...
...profanity-laden
in the back?
Okay, here it is.
Well... don't make it weird.
Later, nerd.
It takes a nerd to know a nerd.
Okay. You made it weird. Bye.
GINA: I left
my baby in the car.
Hey, there's, uh...
...something I've been
thinking about a lot
that's been bothering me and...
I got you something.
Oh.
I found your friend.
Pumpkin!
Awesome, right?
I drove all the way
to New Jersey,
and I was up and down these
streets, looking all over.
I was just about to give up,
and I was over
by your old place,
and suddenly I hear
this little bell.
I thought, wait a minute! I looked
in your neighbor's window...
...and I saw this asshole
sitting right on the couch.
I said,
"You are coming with me,
"even if you don't want
to go back with her."
Oh, he fought you, huh?
Yeah, he fought me pretty hard.
Wow.
But I'm just glad that I
could make this reuniting.
What a surprise this is, huh?
What a surprise, huh?
Look at where you are!
This was never your cat, was it?
No.
Goddamn it. Put him in the box.
Put him in the box!
Can you put him back?
Do I have a lot of choice?
Can you make sure he's got
lots of water?
Just don't.
He likes to snuggle.
Don't make me put the
cat down and punch you.
It's no use
We're gonna have to fight
You've thrown your words
'round a thousand times
Like a child
who can't empathize
You don't speak the language
You don't read my signs
You wanna know
what I really think?
You wanna know
what I really believe?
There's a fire
burning up in here
See the smoke
coming out of my ears
More trouble's gonna find us
if we're all alone
I wanna show you
what I really mean
But you're always
on the outside looking in
Oh, won't you
come into my head?
Come inside,
lie down in my head?
Oh, won't you
come into my head?
I just wanna have you
up in my head
Look through my eyes
I'm your binocular
And every time you'll get
a shock you'll learn
What's it like to be
in my dimension
I'll be the center
of your attention
The quiet prose and
the crack of the snare
More trouble's gonna find us
if we're all alone
I wanna show you
what I really mean
But you're always
on the outside looking in
Oh, won't you
come into my head?
Come inside,
lie down in my head
Oh, won't you

Oh, won't you
come into my head?
Come inside,
lie down in my head?
Oh, won't you
come into my head?
I just wanna have you
up in my head
Oh, you want
a piece of my mind?
Emphatic and erratic
at the drop of a dime
Oh, you want
a piece of my mind?
Climatic and dramatic
like Jekyll and Hyde
Emphatic and erratic
at the drop of a dime
Oh, you want
a piece of my mind?
Like the blood
running through my veins
But from the pews
of the congregation
You'll never know
the real salvation
You wanna know
what I really think?
You wanna know
what I really believe?
There's a fire
burning up in here
See the smoke
coming out my ears?
Oh, won't you
