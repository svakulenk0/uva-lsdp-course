White Mike and his father
moved after his mother died of breast cancer.
They can't control the old radiators,
and it's very hot in springtime.
In White Mike's room,
old unpacked boxes stick out of the closet...
But sometimes, if you can't see
what you're finished with, it's better.
White Mike stripped to his shorts
and lay down on the floor...
That's how it was
the first night in his new room.
White Mike has never
smoked a cigarette in his life.
Never had a drink.
Never sucked down a doobie.
He once went three days without sleep
as a kind of experiment.
That's as close as he's ever gotten
to fucked up.
White Mike has become
a very good drug dealer.
Upper East Side of Manhattan.
-
- White Mike is busy with pickups in Harlem.
The one that the kids White Mike sells to
only know from rap songs.
- And loud music and packed houses and more rounds.
-
And kids from Hotchkiss and Andover
and St. PauI's and Deerfield-
They tell stories about how it is
to kids from Dalton and Collegiate...
You've
reached Mike. Do your thing at the beep.
Look, shit is happening, Coz-
monstrous, bewildering shit-
and I need to see you.
You know, so call me back fast, all right?
White Mike is avoiding
his cousin Charlie's phone calls tonight...
because Charlie is strung out
on a new drug called Twelve.
I saw the popgun man...
in the park today.
Charlie and their friend Hunter
stayed with White Mike...
So, to my mom.
To your mom.
Now everything's different.
White Mike thought,
"Business first. I'll deal with Charlie later."
All she could think was,
"That bitch, Miss Lemky, gave me a 'B."'
Miss Lemky has had it out for me ever since she
overheard me telling Vanessa she's a lesbian.
Seriously, you hire your girlfriend
as your assistant? How obvious is that?
No! This isn't just one "B."
This is huge. This can affect everything-
getting into Wesleyan, Which law school
I attend, the firm I become partner at...
maybe even Who I marry-
assuming I don't marry Johnny Depp.
They should send Miss Lemky back to Reade
Where they found her eating pussy and granola.
I see you.
Sara Ludlow is the hottest girl in her school.
When that kid Chris, whose house
she's going to, made up the chart...
about where the girls stood-
like the stock market quotes-
Where are we going? Who's gonna be there?
Mostly seniors, I hope. It's that kid Chris's
house with the crazy-ass brother Claude.
Oh, my God.
His parents sent him to some Outward Bound
boot camp so he wouldn't go to jail.
- Jail!
- Okay. But he is so superthug six-pack hard.
- We have to go.
- Ew.
- Whatever. Your nose job looks good.
- Thank you.
I got you, White boy. Come on.
Hunter McCullough plays ball
at the Harlem rec...
'cause he doesn't like being the rich white kid
from the Upper East Side.
Yo, Watch it, man!
-  They don't like it either.
- Whoo!
Yo, What the fuck?
Get fuckin' off!
Hey, man. Get off me!
Hell yeah! Fuck him up, man.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Stay down, punk! Down! Stay down.
Get off of me!

-
- What's up?
- Yo, fuck your boy, Mike.
Nana.
What the fuck?
- Consigliere.
- What the hell happened, man?
Can you believe this shit?
Nana fucking Went crazy.
-  Geez.
- How's school going, man?
Yo, my dad told me if I didn't get into Harvard,
I had to go to Dartmouth.
He Went there, right?
My grandfather gave them a science building.
-
- Yeah.
I guess if you got into Harvard, you'd get
to be with Warren. That's good, right?
Yeah, dude. That's What I'm saying, man.
If Warren got in, We could rip that place up.
- Ah.
- Come on. The three of us together.
Old times. Look. You'd be my year.
No, I know, man. I just-
That's exactly What I want, right?
Old times. Come on.
-
- Look. Could you just let one go?
Hey. Spring break, Hunter-gatherer.
Hey. What do you need?
"Yeah. Old times, Mike,"Hunter thought.
"When you weren't a drug dealer
and Charlie wasn't a junkie with a gun.
On the corner of 149th Street
and Malcolm X Boulevard...
For him, it's always a lot better going down
to the rec than it is coming back uptown-
- What the fuck is the matter with you, Charles?
- I'm gonna need some more.
Think I got time
to be out here bullshitting with you?
- Man, What?
- I'll get it to you tomorrow.
Come here with that bullshit.
Where my money, Charlie?
No, I'm sorry. You're right. No, I fucked up.
Get the fuck over here.
Give me the fucking money,
you White junkie-ass bitch.
I got your money.
Give me the fucking money.
- Oh, shit.
- Get back, all right?
- Chill out, man.
- Just give me the shit, Lionel. Just give me the shit.
Relax, man. You got What you want.
Here's the TWelve, man. Take it.
Relax, man.
-  Yo, it's Charlie. Not here.
-
Yo, Charlie. It's your cousin.
Call me back, man.
Hey.
Chris Kenten throws parties for people...
he doesn't really know
and doesn't really like...
and pretends to enjoy them
because he thinks he should.
Hey, you want to come in?
Uh- No. I'm good.
You guys have fun. Call me.
Oh, shit.
That's White Mike.
No shit.
- Oh, Ludlow, I love you so much!
- Ladies.
Yo, White Mike. Hold up, man. Hold up.
- What's up, buddy?
- Yo, We gotta smoke some bowls tonight.
- Rothko. Cool it.
- And then We can find some hos.
You thuglings gotta quit smoking Weed.
Mark Rothko is called Mark Rothko...
- because on a school trip to the Met-
-  Hey!
He careened into
the real Mark Rothko's Untitled #12.
-
-
Oh, shit!
The painting had to be restored.
He has no ideq
who the real Mark Rothko was...
- ##
- You're Sara Ludlow.
- You know me?
- Everyone knows Who you are.
It's not too packed.
It's early. Where's your boyfriend?
Driving in from Southampton.
- Is your brother here?
- No.
Alissa Royston Reade...
thought there were only two people
at this party she'd want to talk to-
Roy Llewelyn Frowick,
who is the last word on fashion...
Hi.
- How are you?
- Good. How are you?
Yo, White Mike is a douche bag.
They developed it.
It's really not that complicated.
Toxic sludge spills over CÃte d'Ivoire,
a bunch of Africans fall over dead.
- Hey.
- Hi.
How are ya?
Who was driving that boat?
A Greek tanker flying a Panamanian flag.
- Molly, What are you doing?
- Hey, Michael.
Molly Norton.
Her father had once worked
for White Mike's father as a waiter.
He always kept her separate
from the privileged world he grew up in.
How is working for your dad?
Are you glad you took the year off?
Yeah, no. It's good, you know.
I'm just, um- I'm learning a lot, Which is nice.
And I- I'm working so much...
I can practically run the place
with my eyes closed, so that's good.
That's cool. What kind of stuff does he
have you doing? What's your day like?
Well, I normally go in around 1:00...
and I just do errands for my dad
and bookkeeping and all that.
Just, you know, living the life.
You know me, Molly.
- Hey. It sounds nice. Better than my job.
- Yeah.
Uh, do they have you working
on Saturday night?
Yeah, I actually do have to work
on Saturday night.
Would you maybe want to grab coffee
in the afternoon?
- I can do that. That sounds good.
- Yeah?
Yeah, sure. Hey.
Hey, Saturday afternoon's perfect.
But listen. I gotta go.
I'll talk to you soon, okay?
- Yeah. I'll see you on Saturday.
- Okay.
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye.
Molly always
reminded White Mike of his mother.
and she couldn't remember a time
she hadn't been in love with him.
Molly came to Mike's mother's funeral,
but Mike didn't talk to her.
Mike dropped out of school
and started dealing to his ex-classmates.

What the fuck is this shit?
Chris!
Oh, Christopher!
Oh, my God. It's him. It's Claude.
- Go fuck him.
- What? Like just go-
- Go.
- Okay.
- Fuck!
-
Chris's brother Claude
once took a shit in the middle of his bed...
They made Luisa the housekeeper
clean it up.
Daddy's home, boys.
Hi, Claude.
Listen. You're not gonna be a fuckin' pussy
and tell Mom I'm home, are you?
- Of course not.
- Yeah?
What about the time I Went AWOL from Mountain
School and was chilling in the Hamptons?
I told you a thousand times, Claude,
that wasn't me that ratted you out.
- Just keep it shut.
- What happened?
I kicked the boot camp guy's ass and split.
So fuck your punk-ass party!
- Yo, T-Man.
- Hey, man.
- We're out.
- Right now?
Yes, now.
Now!
-  Wait.
- What if Mom and Dad call?
Just keep your mouth shut.
Hi.
Hunter?
- I'm kind of tired, Dad.
- Hey. Look.
I gotta get going, but your letter of intent
is due in a couple Weeks.
I just want to remind you how lucky you are
that you're going to Harvard.
I worked my ass off in prep school,
and even if I got into Harvard...
your grandfather wouldn't let me go.
And look, the, um-
The cell phones-
they're not gonna work on the boat.
So, I want to use the sat phone, all right?
You didn't even notice the blood, Dad?
Hunter.
Claude and Tobias are in Chinatown...
buying a barbecued duck
for Claude's piranhas.
In Claude's pockets he's carrying
one clear plastic prism filled with weed...
one fake I.D. with his picture and fake name,
Maurice Charles, Columbus, Ohio...
whom he fingered
while they watched Blue Man Group.
Two MetroCards and one cell phone that
says "Pussy Monger" when he turns it on.
Get the fuck out, man.
You are one true criminal, Claudius.
You know that?
I'm out of here by Easter, man.
- No way, dude.
- Yeah, the Gunnery.
You've been in more fucking boarding schools
than my mom's had husbands.
You know that?
Cash only.
- You're so not gonna do this.
- I am so gonna do this.
Gabby and Shelly
don't think blow jobs are sex.
They're best friends
because they agree on things like that.
The lighting in here is terrible.
Really? Shut up. Do I look fat?
Put Claude's face next to your face.
Sara Ludlow is tired
of waiting for her boyfriend.
She thought, "How long does it take
to drive in from Southampton anyway?"
I had to wait for my parents to go to their
stupid party so I could sneak the Porsche.
I'm coming as fast as I can.
Fuck you.
- Whoo!
- ##

-
Gabby. Shelly.
You're not- You're not leaving?
You should've invited more people.
# Hey, you #
Did you just come in your pants?
I'm gonna- I'm gonna get a beer.
- Okay.
-
Hey.
You. Um-
You-
Jessicq's an ace at soccer, swimming, skiing...
Late one night she read the Gettysburg
address for her advanced history class.
She memorized it
and liked it more than anybody.
I chose to do my speech on Abraham Lincoln
because he was so tall.
the same way John F. Kennedy
would become one.
And in their deaths...
was created a symbol of freedom and peace.
Something this country can look up to.
But the truth is, death doesn't vindicate.
It doesn't vindicate.
It may have been good for the country,
but it wasn't good for Lincoln...
and it definitely wasn't good
for John F. Kennedy.
'And it wasn't good for me,"
thought White Mike...
- whose mother had died the day before.
- So-
White Mike's father said
he didn't have to go to school.
What are you saying? Did they die in vain?
"Four score and seven"-
But if you had to ask John or Abe...
if they liked being shot in the head...
probably say "no."
"We cannot dedicate, We cannot consecrate...
Where the tragedy lies-
they Were robbed of their future...
and the possibilities that lay within it.
And these lives will never be replaced.
So you're born in the capital of the world.
And that's how it is,
because that's how everyone wants it to be.
It is about when you wake up in the morning
and the snow is already coming down...
and it's bright between the buildings
where the sun falls...
Because if you don't want something,
you've got nothing.
You're washed away and then buried
under the snow and shadows...
no one will remember
where you were frozen and buried.
I can't find Charlie, Mike.
He left this Weird message.
Yeah.
He said he saw the popgun man in the park.
All right. Call me.
Yeah. Me and Nana Were tight.
Was he ever in any kind of trouble?
- No, man. He was straight up, man.
- How was he last night?
This punk-ass White kid, Hunter,
just started fucking with him.
He's like a racist or something, Detective,
like one of them Nazis or some shit.
He comes up here to play ball at our rec
'cause he likes starting shit.
The Man fucking with minorities.
Jessica had every bear
that she had ever purchased...
or that had ever been given to her
since the day she was born.
Hi.
I'm Donnie.
Aren't you too old to be a Donnie?
Tell your mom I'll call her later.
Jess. Baby.
Would you get me a little blue pill
from my medicine cabinet?
Mm-hmm.
Jessica got one pill
for her mother and two for herself.
Â¶ California friends Â¶
- Hello.
- Hey, Chris. It's Jessicq.
Thank you for taking care of me last night
and getting me home and everything.
Yeah, sure.
So you get your Weed
from that White Mike dude, right?
Um, could I get his number?
Yeah. Yeah, sure.
You want to get some and smoke?
Actually, I was thinking
about getting something else.
Where's Sara?
Oh, my God. Sean totaled his dad's Porsche
and is near death at St. Luke's.
Oh, please! He hurt his ankle
or his shoulder or something.
- Whatever.
- Is she there now?
Later. She Went to go get her teeth
Whitened for her birthday.
Exactly. What are We doing tomorrow night?
Fieldstone lacrosse team
is having one on Madison.
Riverdale boys on Fifth.
Dalton- cute guys- on 58th.
- That kid. You know his dad's-
- No.
- What?
- 58th is too far downtown.
- Well, yeah.
- Yeah.
Even though Jessica knows
she is smarter than her friends...
Who is cool and Who is not.
Chicks must come before dicks.
Our parents suck.
The Hamptons rock.
Oh, my God. It's Andrew. He's, like, deep.
He's never hit on me.
- He must be so gay.
- He's really cute.
Hey, Hunter. It's Andrew. Where are you, man?
I'm headed for the reservoir.
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God. You're bleeding. He's bleeding.
-  Oh, my God. Is he okay?
-  EW!
Hunter McCullough?
You played ball at the rec center,
Yeah.
You mind taking a ride down to the precinct
to answer a few questions?
Wha- About What?
The fight at the rec? Did Nana press charges?
Just a few questions, Hunter.
- I'm just gonna go change.
- No.
You're fine like that.
- Did something happen?
- No. Who said anything happened?
Just gonna ask you a few questions.
- There you go.
- Thanks, man.
White Mike.
Um, Chris sent me.
Oh, yeah. What do you need?
Um, last night I did this thing.
It's like... coke...
and then it was like ecstasy, and then-
Yeah. It's called Twelve.
Can I buy some?
I don't handle it.
Um, do you know Who does?
Yeah.
Yeah, I think I can hook you up.
Chris has your number, yeah?
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
Bye.
In second and third grade,
Charlie's nanny, Dorrine...
took Charlie, Hunter and White Mike
to the zoo regularly.
They would always wait so they could
see the animal statue strike the time.
The most important ritual, the one the boys
remembered as long as they lived...
White Mike hadn't seen
the popgun man or Dorrine in years.
- By the way, do you smoke dope?
- Oh, yes, Michael.
At those parties, me and all
the other nannies and housekeepers...
used to smoke spliffs
out in the back stairwell...
and talk about all the famous,
beautiful people...
after I put you to sleep.
And don't you know, Michael?
We really moved like ghosts
in and out of your lives...
just the way good help should.
Yeah. Yeah. I know What you mean.
It's like What I do now in dealing and all that.
It's like that.
I move in and out of people's lives
like a ghost...
so no one even remembers When I'm gone.
That's the way the best help
is supposed to be.
Take care of your cousin Charlie, Michael.
Where'd you get that, Charlie?
I love how shiny it is in my hand, you know.
It's like-
It's like I'm pointing lightning, you know.
Get that out of my face, huh?
You know I don't do guns, man.
- Hey. It's Hunter. Leave a message.
-
Hey, Hunter. It's me.
Just wondering
if you've seen Charlie around anywhere.
He's vanished again.
So let me know.
And Where are you? Call me back. Bye.
How often do you play ball up there?
I don't know. It depends. About twice a month.
- You ever see Nana outside the gym?
- No.
How'd you get home after the game?
I walked.
Why not take a taxi?
I'm sorry. Did something happen to Nana or-
Maybe you know something
you're not telling me.
Look. When can I get out of here?
Your doorman, Javier, nice guy.
Says you're a good kid.
Says you came home around 10:00...
but you left again shortly after.
Where'd you go?
I went for a walk.
You do a lot of walkin', huh?
Yeah. I like the city at night.
Huh.
Why didn't you change your shirt
before you left?
Hunter thinks he should call someone.
But his father and mother are on some boat,
and they'd be pissed.
He could call White Mike,
but he's a drug dealer...
Hi.
-
- Mmm.
- Where are your parents?
- They just left.
Dad's so pissed I totaled the Porsche.
Yeah.
What did the doctor say about football?
I don't remember.
You're on heavy drugs, huh?
- Yeah.
-
How about a hand job?
This is supposed to be a private room.
I was born in this hospital.
I mean, it's just a few stitches. I can go home.
Seventeen stitches, actually,
and you have to stay for observation.
You should go see Dr. Baker
Who did my mom's face-lift.
- You're Sara Ludlow.
- You know me?
My sister Vanessa,
she goes to school with Layla-
Yeah. Everyone knows everyone.
What happened to you?
Um, hockey.
Oh, yeah? Where do you play?
Collegiate.
Collegiate?
- Isn't that all guys?
- Yeah.
Your playlist is so cool. Mine sucks.
- Take it.
- No, I couldn't.
No. Really. Just take it.
It's okay.
I'll get it from you next time I see you.
That's sweet. Thanks.
Hey. Where are we gonna party
for your birthday tomorrow night?
I have a plan.
Bye, jocks.
I'm glad you're home, Bro.
- Chris.
- No, I don't want to-
Hit me. Come on.
Hit me! Go.

Yo, there she is up ahead.
This is Lionel.

A thousand. Here.
Get that shit out of my face.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Let's walk.
Ball it up in the palm of your hand.
Pass it to me.
- Here.
-
So, Lionel, I was thinking, maybe I could
get your number, then we could just-
You know, it'd be easier
if we just went direct next time.
No. Miguel Blanco here will hook us up.
- Start stepping, bitch.
- Sorry.
Bitch gonna ask for the number.
Fuck.
Have you seen my cousin Charlie around?
- Who?
- Charlie.
The guy Who hooked us up.
He's still dealing Twelve for you, isn't he?
No, I ain't seen him.
All right. If you do, let him know I'm looking
for him. I appreciate that. Later.
Peace.
We should throw my birthday party
here tomorrow night.
Just had a party last night.
No. I mean... famous party.
The kind of party people lie
and say they were at.
I could get everybody cool to come.
Sit down.
Wouldn't want it to be too big.
Don't you want to have
a famous party for my birthday?
- Yeah. Sure, but-
- Biggest party ever.
It'll be amazing.
Wait till you see my dress.
Not too many people though.
But it has to be huge.
Besides...
people will need
to keep themselves entertained...
in case we start to have extra fun by ourselves.
Somewhere else.
Thought you had a boyfriend.
I have lots of boyfriends.
I mean, I'm not a slut.
Of course you're not.
But different guys are interesting
for different reasons.
You're interesting for a very specific reason.
What's that?
You'll have to figure that out for yourself.
I just don't want too many people.
You want me, don't you?
Just... leave the people up to me. Okay?
Now, how about some cash for your part?
Yeah. Come upstairs.
I'll grab the money. How much?
Two grand. And I'll stay here.
Okay.
- You want a beer or something?
- I'm good. Thanks.
Are we inviting everyone?
Well, not everyone.
Everyone.
Well, I mean, everyone cool.
Tobias has been a model
since getting discovered...
on the beach in East Hampton
when he was 11.
He loves hands touching
his head, face and body-
- Yo. Medicine Man.
- Hey. How's it going?
-  Tobias.
- Fuck.
There's a bombshell model back there
if you want me to hook it up.
- I'm good, man.
- Sure?
- Yeah.

- I'll let you get back to it. See you.
-
- Hey, Molly.
- Michael. Hey, what are you doing?
Not much. Just running a few errands
for my dad actually. How about you?
I'm just writing a report
on The Plague by Camus.
Have to finish before break's over.
Can you believe it?
Oh, my God. Yeah, I totally know The Plague.
How do you like it?
Rats dying, people dying.
It's just so much death and... dying.
I'm- I'm so sorry.
No, no. Don't worry about it.
-
- You know, Michael.
I'm here for you if you ever want to talk,
you know, about your mom or-
Hey, listen. My dad's calling me
on the other line, so I'm just gonna go.
I'll talk to you When I see you. Okay?
Yeah, yeah. Are we still on for tomorrow?
Yeah, yeah.
I'm gonna see you tomorrow. That's right.
All right. See you then.
Bye.
Molly didn't see White Mike cry at the funeral.
She saw his cousin Charlie cry about it-
and White Mike's father.
Everyone said he looked handsome
at the funeral.
There was a wig on his mother's corpse,
which made him angry.
He would have rather
had seen her for the last time...
No, Mom. Adjust your camera.
How's Saint Martin's?
Besides your father's sunburn
and the mosquitoes...
- Everything okay, sweetie?
- Yeah.
Carmelita's nephew came in from the
Dominican, so I gave her a few days off.
Thank you, darling.
You are really taking control.
I'm having a few people over tomorrow night.
Nothing too big.
Actually, I gotta go.
Mark and Timmy just showed up. Guys.
Hey! Mommy dearest! How are you?
Claude, you know
you are not welcome in that house.
Well, rehab was great. Thanks for asking.
You look tired, Mom. You still taking
your Ambien, Xanax, Sonata, Lunesta?
Did I miss any?
- I want you to leave immediately.
- But I'm just settling in!
If you don't leave immediately,
I'm gonna get your father.
I love you too, Mom.
- Chris, I'm disappointed in you.
-
Mom, you have to talk to him.
Just ask him about rehab or something.
He's leaving in a few days for the Gunnery.
Just chill out, Mom.
-
-
Mom wants to talk to you.
Claude.
-
- Claude.
- You guys really need to cut this shit out.
- Fuck you!
Please talk to her, man.
"Maurice Charles. " "Columbus, Ohio"?
How's it hanging, dog?
It's fake.
No. Come on. What the fuck, man?
Fake, fake. No wear hat in real I.D.
Just give him the beer, okay, Al-Qaeda?
Please. Thanks.
Leave, or I call cops.
Well, how about I call my foot up your ass?
Shit! He just busted out a nine-mil.
He was gonna pop a cap in your ass.
So, there's a whole
lot of shit that goes down at school, huh?
Sure is.
Yeah, they all have bad taste in music,
and they're all assholes.
What about her friends?
Especially her friends.
Who would you kill first
if you had to kill someone there?
- I'd kill 'em all.
- I would have to kill that Jessica bitch first.
I'd take the nine-milli, and I'd be like
"pop, pop" right to the back of her head.
And I would never have to
be an honor student at Wesleyan.
Everyone would cry and say
what a lovely, lovely girl she was.
And the school would have
a moment of silence.
Diane Sawyer
would have Sarq, Gabby and Shelly-
Katie Couric would do an in-depth report
on high school violence.
And the most moving voice of all, Ann Curry...
Oh, no.
- Did it all.
-  All gone.
Oh, fuck.
- Oh, no.
-
Oh, fuck.
-
- I'm looking for something special.
Cash only.
- Can I go now?
- You know a kid named Arturo Berrara?
Uh, Arturo from the rec?
Arturo can place you at the projects
a few minutes after the shots were fired.
Shots? No, he's lying.
I- I want an attorney.
I need to contact my father by satellite phone.
Forensics has a match. The blood on your
shoes and the blood at the murder scene.
Murder scene? What?
You murdered Nana.
And now you want to tell me
the name of the White kid you killed?
His I.D. says he's Maurice Charles
from Columbus, Ohio.
But, Hunter...
there is no Maurice Charles
from Columbus, Ohio.
Yo, Warren. What's going on, man?
You back in the city?
Yeah, Well, listen, I have a-
I've got about a quarter left.
- You want it?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Oh, shit.
White Mike thought...
-
- Fuck!
I was just thinking that
maybe instead of us going to Bergdorf's...
you could just give me money
and I could go myself.
Absolutely not.
You've already spent all of your vacation money.
Oh, my God. Mom!
I'm buying you a new dress
for Sara's party tonight, and that is it.
I don't want a new dress.
You have no idea how lucky you are.
Are you aware that the Mortimers
have lost 40 % of their net worth?
- Forty.
- Yes. And they are still stinking rich.
Better not let your father
hear you talk that way.
Better not let my father meet Donnie.
I just got your report card.
Mom, I got one fucking "B."
Can we not make a media circus about it?
Okay. I was just wondering
if anything was bothering you.
No!
No.
Well, if there is, it might be time
for you to go talk to someone.
You want me to go to a shrink.
Yeah, a shrink. I go to one.
Three-quarters of your idiot friends go to one.
And the other quarter should go to one.
I try to fuck with my shrink.
I try to fuck my shrink.
Mine knows nothing about sex or guys.
My shrink is so stupid.
It might help to get that grade up.
This Whole Wesleyan idea-
that's between you and your father.
It has nothing to do with me,
and a "B" isn't cutting it.
Whatever, Mommy! I don't need a shrink.
I don't know What I would talk about.
You'd talk about school, boys, me.
I'm sure you'd find something.
Fine! I will go. Can I just have some money?
Absolutely not.
And I put a great little Marc Jacobs
on hold for you at Bergdorf's.
Rosa, we're leaving.
God!
I can meet you around, like, 4:00?
Is that too late?
No, not at all.
Listen, let's meet
at that coffee shop you like on Lex.
Across from that pizza place. Remember?
Yeah, yeah. That sounds good.
All right. Listen, I'll see you
When I get there. Okay?
- Bye.
- Bye.
- What's up, warren? I thought you were in Cancun.
- How you doin'?
I gotta meet the family.
We're skiing in Sun Valley.
I leave tonight. It's boring.
- I'm almost looking forward to going back to school.
- Yeah, right.
No, really, man.
Harvard's better than you think.
- You should come.
- Nah.
You got no discipline, Mike.
Discipline?
Warren, my Whole life disciplined me.
Yeah. And so real.
Excuse me?
What, you come back here thinking
you're learning something important?
I spent the night in a fucking
construction hole there, Warren...
to save my last bag
to bring to you on 88th Street.
My dad's a waiter. All right?
To pay off his debts from my mom's cancer
and his bankrupt restaurant.
- And you think you're real?
- Don't be so melodramatic.
Look at yourself. Fuck off.
Hey, do you know Where Hunter is?
Yeah, Hunter. Where are you?
If you and Charlie are fucking with me,
I swear to God.
By the way, Warren's a douche.
Hunter.
You may not remember me.
Avery Kimball, your father's attorney.
I brought you some fresh clothing.
And I have your father on the line.
We'll have you out of here in an hour.
Dad, I didn't kill anyone.
Don't say anything, Hunter.
You're in Avery's hands now.
Yeah, I know.
All right. I'm on the first plane there.
That's the best I can do.
JesusI Who could have
expected anything like this?
Yeah. I know.
Hunter thought...
Pretty shitty, Dad.
Just say it once, please.
You need to be moving Twelve, man.
I got orders off the rack coming out your hood.
- Yeah?
- I'm telling you, Mike.
This is What you need to fuck with, right here.
Twelve, man.
- You know that girl you sold to yesterday?
- What girl, man?
She's been hitting me up hard.
She wants your number.
She wants to place a tall order
for some birthday party.
But, Lionel, look.
I can't be getting involved
with this Twelve shit, man.
All right?
Is it cool if I give her your number?
White Mike's just popping, man.
You're full of questions, man.
You want some trees or not?
Give her my number, man.
All right. Cool. Thanks.
It's gonna be a famous party.
And I'll be famous.
That's What you want- to be famous?
Well, if you're famous in your school,
you're famous in all schools...
and then in the city-
or at least the part that matters.
Then you have a career.
So...
Sean's your boyfriend?
I have lots of boyfriends.
I mean, I'm not a slut.
Different guys are interesting
for different reasons.
You're interesting for-
I'm sorry.
That's a line.
I've used it before, a lot.
I think if I met myself, I'd hate me.
Why do you say that?
Because...
I'm a shallow, narcissistic bitch...
Who manipulates everyone for everything...
and freaks out royally
When I don't get What I want.
I mean, you wouldn't even like me
if I wasn't hot, right?
- Who says I like you?
-
You're sweet.
- Do you have any weed?
- Yeah. Sure.
Bring it tonight, okay?
Everyone's bringing something.
- That blonde bitch is using you.
- Shut up.
Not that you'll listen to me...
not that you actually have a chance
of popping your fucking cherry.
Shut up. I'm not a virgin.
- Oh, yeah? Who?
- Zibby Schwartz, Southampton.
You wish.
How would you know? You weren't even there.
Where the hell did you get that?
The only tits you ever sucked on are Mom's.
- You're Mama's boy.
- Shut the fuck up.
I- I'm sorry. What? What did you say?
I couldn't hear you.
Chill out.
Listen!
You've always been her favorite.
That's Why you're going to Saint Martin's
tomorrow, and I'm not.
I found your ticket in your room.
Mama's boy.
- She thought you'd still be at boot camp.
- What?
You on roids again?
Say it. "I'm a- I'm a fucking mama's boy."
- No.
- Say it!
Um-
Luisa has to get in your room to clean.
Yeah.
Get the fuck out of my face.
Luisa Bustamonte
has worked for the family for 25 years.
Chris, Claude and their parents
think she loves them.
Careful, careful. Let me help you.
Jessica?
Chris.
Hey, could I borrow some money?
I'll pay you back as soon as school starts.
I just-
Uh, actually, Sara spent all my money.
You're looking at it.
Here you go.
Andrew thought, "Damn. This is a drug deal."
Is this your first time?
And the last, hopefully.
Since you're not planning on becoming
a regular customer, Why the weed?
This girl I know wanted it,
so I'm sort of picking it up for her.
It's her birthday.
She shouldn't smoke it
if she's not brave enough to buy it.
Yeah, I guess. You know girls.
Yeah.
Do you have a girlfriend?
Not really, no. She's, um-
Well, she's too good for the life I lead,
you know?
Well, listen, um-
Good luck with the girl and everything.
- Yeah. Thanks for the weed.
- Hey, anytime.
Good luck to you too, man,
you know, with dealing or Whatever.
I hope it works out for you.
Yeah. Thanks.
As Andrew walked away, he thought...
Hey. What do you got for me?
Medicine Man. Can you hook me up with
a couple ounces for the bounces, quick?
Okay, listen, I have a 4.00
at 71st and Lexington.
That pizza place, you know?
If you can be there in five minutes.
Oh, dude, I'm so there. Fuckin' Medicine Man.
-
- Fuck.
Hey, Where are you?
I said fi- I said five minutes.
- I'm across the street, dude.
- Okay, Well, I'm here. Bye.
Man.
- Yo, Medicine Man.
- Hey.
- I'm sorry. I ran into this babe.
- Don't worry about it.
- So What's up? How are you?
- Here. Good.
- Are you listening to me?
- Yeah.
There's undercovers in the area.
We gotta get the fuck out of here
as fast as we can.
- I will catch you at Sara's party tonight.
- Will do.
- See you later?
- Okay.
- All right.
- Bye.
Hey!
Hey! What's going on?
- How are you?
- I'm good. How you been?
I've been really, really good.
It's been a long time, Michael.
Yeah, I know. I've just been-
A lot of late nights, you know?
It's good though.
You look tired.
Has your dad been working you hard?
I've just been working till 3:00 in the morning
every night hosting for my dad.
- But other than that, yeah, it's a good gig.
-
- Good.
- The restaurant host. How you doing?
I'm good.
I think I need to induct someone
into the Hypocrites' Club.
Uh-oh. Who's that?
Me.
It's not that easy to make the cut, Molly.
- You know that.
- Oh, I don't know about that.
I just let some pretty boy
try and put the moves on me.
Oh, so What?
So What about the fact that guys like him
stand for everything we despise...
and I totally let him flatter me?
- I did. And get this-
- Hmm. Hmm.
Not only is he a model,
he made sure to give me his card.
But he told me exactly What pages
of What magazines all of his pictures are on.
- And he had blue toenail polish.
- Oh, that's painful.
- Cool. Thanks.
- Thank you.
- I ordered us hot chocolates.
- Thank you.
So, What do you think?
Do I make it into this dreaded club or What?
Well, let's see.
He's obviously pretty good-looking,
and girls are attracted to beauty.
But no, you're repelled by superficiality...
so it's complexity, not hypocrisy.
You don't get in.
Why are you the only one that gets me?
And Why can I never figure you out, Michael?
I don't know.
Uh- Well, Blue Toes
invited me to a party tonight.
What party?
Sara something
and I guess a guy named Chris.
- I don't know them.
- Yeah? Let me see.
Well, um, are you gonna go?
I was, uh- I was thinking maybe
I could come by the restaurant tonight.
I haven't been by in forever, and it'd be nice
to do something When you get off.
It just gets really busy on Saturday nights.
Or you could. I mean-
It's just busy.
- Yeah, yeah.
- I mean, maybe some other time.
Yeah, I understand.
So-
Well, um, I guess I'm gonna
go to this party then.
- You are?
- Yeah.
Yeah? Okay.
Um-
Okay. Well, uh-
Listen, I gotta go.
My dad's, um- he's waiting on me.
- And, um-
- All right.
- I gotta get to work, so-
- Okay.
But listen, it was really nice to see you.
Um, here.
- No, I got it. I already paid.
- What?
Don't worry about it.
Thanks.
All right.
Well, have fun at the party...
With Tobias the tool bag.
Is that a hint of jealousy
I'm hearing in your voice, Michael?
- No, it's not jealousy.
- No?
Come on. We're friends, right?
Yeah.
Bye.
- Take care of yourself, okay?
- You too.
White Mike loves rooftops.
It's Saturday night,
and the city is bright and loud...
in case he finally gets laid tonight,
pops his cherry...
fucks her hard, fucks her from behind,
fucks her gratuitously...
taps that ass, gets with her,
gets some, gets in, gets it on...
From now on,
I can get Sara Ludlow to whack it."
-
- Andrew masturbates in the shower...
because he doesn't want to seem too horny
if he hooks up with Sarq.
I'm not a tank-top girl!
Molly decides this would be
a good night to get drunk.
Lionel, it's Jessica.
And Claude didn't give a shit
what anyone thought.
# Bang, bump-bump #
- Thank you so much.
- # Bump-bump, bump-bump, bump #
Hi. How are you?
Hey. How are you?
So, I was thinking that maybe
We should get some Twelve later.
I would get it, but I don't have any cash.
I don't have shit on me. I'm so sorry.
We'll talk about it.
- I don't even-
- Hi!
- # And you believe me Yeah, bitch, believe me #
-
Chris! We need more champagne!
- Okay.
- Tobias invited me.
Claude could feel the house filling up.
- Yo, Whitey!
- What the hell are you guys doing here?
- We hanging with the White Dog!
- No, you're not.
We're trying to score some chronic, man.
Can you hook us up?
- We need the hookup.
- Holler, baller!
For the last time, you guys aren't
getting any weed, okay? Ever!
I'm sorry.
Goddamn it!
Now we're never gonna get blizzy.
Yo, fuck this shit.
Let's go to Chris's party, man.
We can probably score some shit there.
You know Who else is gonna be there?
-  Ludlow!
-
- Dad?
-  Michael?
- Hey.
- Um, hey, listen. Where are you?
Can you come
to the restaurant right away?
Why? What's wrong?
I really think it's better
if I tell you when you get here.
No, Dad, just tell me now. I can take it.
No, Dad. What is it?
Just tell me right now, please.
# You're gonna drive me crazy #
- # You're gonna drive me wild #
- Sorry.
- # Makin'hairpins out of glass #
-
- # I believe in believing the things that we don't see #
-
- This is like the best party... ever!
- Ever!
Party people, I have returned!
- I'm so happy you're here.
- You are?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Hi.
- Hi.
I'm Molly. Tobias invited me,
but I haven't seen him yet.
He's around somewhere.
# Better things are coming
I swear there's truth in that #
Hey, I'm Chris, and this is my party.
Really? Chris, is this the kind of party
Where a 16-year-old girl can get drunk?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Damn, girl! You some fine-ass booty!
I'm really sorry about them.
White Mike thought, "Why am I going here?"
# Oh, yeah #
-
-
Hi.
Let me see the thousand.
I don't have any money right now.
Wait!
I can get you the money later...
if you just leave the Twelve now.
Not without the cash.
- I'm good for the money, Lionel.
- No.
You need to go back in that house
and get you some drinks.
Just relax.
Wait!
I can give you something else.
I don't want some antique piece of shit
out this old-ass house you just came out of.
I'll give you a blow job.
A blow job?
I'm serious.
- A thousand-dollar blow job?
- I'm serious. What's so funny?
That's an expensive blow job.
I'll fuck you.
I'm a virgin.
Two fucks.
One before I give you the drugs, one after.
No.
First drugs, then we'll have sex.
What are you waiting for, Lionel?
White Mike knew
he'd been in there a long time...
but none from the only person
he wanted to see right now.
-  # Come with me, come with me #
-
- # Come with me, come with me #
-
- ##
-
So, What's going on with you and Tobias?
Nothing. I haven't even seen him actually.
# Five, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 #
Excuse me.
- # Five, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 #
- You guys know Molly Norton?
- No, you hold it.
- Idon't have time for your bullshit.
Fuck you, Mike!
Hey, Molly Norton.
You know Where she is? She's at your party.
- Why don't you chill the fuck out?
- Who the fuck are you?
- What the fuck you gonna do?
- Fuck with me, huh?
Don't fuck with me.
I'm fucking with you!
You're ruining my party!
Hey! White Mike, the drug dealer,
is starting shit upstairs.
- Molly Norton, Chris!
- I don't- Upstairs, man.
Fuck!
Yeah, that's the drug dealer right there.
Michael?
Yo.
Molly? Oh, shit!
- Fuck.
- Lionel. Whoa.
What the fuck you want?
I don't know.
Lionel, that's Charlie's gun.
Fuck, man. He was on some shit, man.
He pulled it on me, man.
- You shot him.
- What the fuck?
You would've shot him too, man.
Oh, God. You killed him.
Chris?
Chris?
Christopher!
You fucking pussy!
Get out here!
Christopher!
-
-
The shooter? Is the shooter inside?
Second floor. His name's Claude.
Good party.
Claude! Put your weapon
down and come out with your hands up!
I repeat: Put your weapon down
and come out with your hands up!
Do it now!
Mmm.
Yeah.
-  Drop your weapon!
-  Drop it!
- Drop the gun!
- Drop it!
-
-
As Sara lay dying, she thought...
and make an unbelievable story
when school starts again.
Molly, I'm so sorry...
I lied to you.
I just-
You know, I didn't want you to know
I was the president...
of the Hypocrites' Club.
Why do you do it?
I mean, how- how can you do it?
I mean, there's-
There's no reason.
I think there is.
You don't- You don't drink.
You don't do drugs.
Because you like the power you have...
being sober...
around people Who are always fucked up.
But you know What?
That makes you
so much more fucked up than them.
Because Who gave you this right...
to just go around and experiment
With other people's lives?
No, you're right.
You're right. I'm sorry. I just-
Molly, When I get out of here,
I'm gonna call you.
No, Michael, no.
Please, don't.
Do not call me or anything
until you stop dealing.
Okay?
I'm sorry.
Molly always
reminded White Mike of his mother.
Hi.
I'm sorry.
Don't say that, Mom.
Okay?
Okay.
We won't talk about it anymore.
We'll just live the best life we can.
Did you hear me, Michael?
Always live the best life you can.
You will not be remembered if you die now.
and you're either too smart
or too dumb to find God.
You have seen that before you
lies a great stretch of road...
# But we have the weights
We have the measures #
# We have to wage an assault
on what it is #
