Connection is a strange thing!
Don't ask how it works
Our friendship goes back years
Our connection is stronger than
Wi-Fi, Bluetooth
The best actor award goes to
Aryan Khanna
First time I'm getting an award,
a major award in the film industry
This one's for you, Ma
Thank you very much
Before I could walk, I learned
how to jump like Aryan
Aryan? The moron!
Anyone insults him
I fight
If I copy his style...
...I get whacked
I don't think I've done enough work.
It's just been 5 years
I still have a long way to go
as an actor and star
I'll work hard and prove
I'm a genuine superstar
I never compare
What is better is to say you are the
best, not bother about others
You're the greatest.
But I'm better
Never met him. But I spend
all day with him
That's real connection
Whatever he does, I cut, copy,
paste, and ditto
Tiny difference
He became a star
And I became his fan
And something else
We live together
In one cinema or the other
The real drama will start now!
None of my achievements
are my own
I am who I am today,
I am where I am today
It's all thanks to my fans
Without my fans, I'm nothing
Can't you even get 40% marks?
It's always Aryan, Aryan
My parents don't get it
He's not just a star,
he's my world
But God bowled a great googly
When God was making Aryan,
some clay was left behind...
...God made me with that
He and I are different.
Poles apart
But we are one
He is Aryan and me, Junior Aryan
I topped up your phone.
Send the money tomorrow
Don't worry
Tomorrow is fine
The shop is closing now
Check your phone
You're a gem. Bye, aunty
Batman, Superman!
Enough slaughter
Shut down now. Kill the bad guys
tomorrow
- Gaurav, what's this?
- It's only 5.30, bro
Don't act smart. I told you.
You're out by 5.30
Go home, kids
Don't mess with me
All well?
Miss Call Center, where were you?
I'm closing
So early?
- I have a show
- 5 minutes. Please
No. I'll be late
Only 5 minutes
It's urgent
I need a recommendation letter
for my US visa
I have a costume trial
Can you do it later? Ok then
Thanks
You don't let us stay and for her...
Her work is urgent. You just
shoot partridges
I get what's urgent
Come back tomorrow
Get lost!
You losers
Sitting here dreaming of America
won't help you
But staring at Aryan's photo
will help you?
- Two minutes to go
- All done
Thank you
How much?
Forget it. Can't charge you
for 5 minutes
- Thanks
- Enjoy!
Brothers, the shop is closed
So the action just left?
What's 30 minutes?
I put this notice up a week ago
Due to the grand Dussehra show
Organised by the Resident Welfare
Assoc. Inder Vihar, DDA Colony
AK Cyber Chat closes
at 5:30 sharp
By order Gaurav Chandna,
proprietor AK Cyber Chat
See you again
If I knew English well, I'd be
a computer myself
The shop won't stay open,
even for the Prime Minister
I said it's closed. You'll get
extra time tomorrow
You photocopy!
Don't be cruel like Ravan
This boy needs to watch porn.
He's upset
I don't heal upset minds
at Cyber Chat
No porn films allowed here anyway.
Out, you guys!
You better outgrow Aryan Khanna.
Sid Kapoor is the man now
Get smart, photocopy
The shop in Sector 28 is open
- Go there
- Don't you dare touch me!
- Don't touch
- Here, I'm touching
Get out of here
Let go! They need a lesson
Want to see porn? Huh...
What are you doing?
Nothing. I let you chat.
So they made trouble
I'm fine
You can all go. Thank you!
The jobless morons
They came to watch blue films.
I whacked them
Why play the hero?
Why didn't you call for help?
But I did call you
My heart did
So you came back
Please, Gaurav. Stop talking
like Aryan
Drop it. Coming to the show tonight?
Too much to do. I don't
have time like you
Today's a birthday special
No, thank you
Welcome
How did you get hurt?
Who hit you? I'll complain to
the association
It's fine. Don't ruin my concentration
Concentration? You can't move.
How will you go on stage?
The prize is 20,000. Cash!
You won't give me 20,000
to go and meet Aryan
My only chance to fulfill my dream
I don't have money to burn
on your silly dreams
What about your Tuesday trips
to the Hanuman temple?
Doesn't your 101-rupee donation
go up in smoke?
Hanumanji is a God.
And your Aryan...
He's important to me
Every fool has met him,
only I haven't
Spray some scent on me
- Careful
- If you can't do it, never mind
My fans are waiting. Get ready
Listen to your mother.
Stop your drama
The real drama starts now
Hold on to your hearts
You're about to see a performance...
...that the Western Union,
moving money for better...
...Super Star competition
can never do without
You guessed right
Here he comes.
The two-year winner:
Our Aryan Khanna Junior
Jindal aunty!
Your pressure cooker on the stove?
The only whistle you'll hear
today is right here
My hattrick year
Today I'll share something personal
About me and Aryan
I hide nothing from you
I'm no ace at romancing
But when I see her, my emotions
go haywire
Words escape me
Senior is an expert heart-stealer.
So I asked him...
...to help his Junior
It's delicate. I must tread carefully
Don't forget
The heart's job is to beat
When you count the night stars...
...and yearn to etch my name
on every star
You know you're in love
When you want to turn back
as you walk ahead
When you look for me
in a crowd
You know you're in love
If you don't believe me
Then hold my hand
If your heart stops, then you know...
...you're in love
I don't have your style, Senior
But if anyone insults you...
...I want to break their teeth
Mummy says, Calm down
Aryan is India's sweetheart
But he's a Delhi boy after all
Come, Senior. Let's show them
some Delhi muscle
Ma used to say: Don't weigh
the food you're eating
Don't count the guys you whack
Here
Use this
I feel like just staring
at the screen
I have this dream
Keep doing your thing
with your heroines
I've been your fan forever
I think you owe me a dance
We'll have a blast
No one will tell who is Senior,
who is Junior. Hit it!
One last thing before I go
I am what I am today
I am where I am today
It's all thanks to my fans
Without my fans
I'm nothing
Brothers and sisters!
The Virat act did not impress us
The Katrina act did not impress
This year like every other year
The Western Union, moving money
for better...
Super Star competition's trophy
goes to our very own...
Gaurav Chandna
Give him a big hand!
I want to thank my Mummy
My Papa
My God
The greatest actor in the world
The Aryan Khanna
Ok, go
But why travel without a ticket?
- Go later
- Later?
Aryan's birthday is in 2 days.
And I must wait to book a ticket?
The ticket collector will catch you
and belt you
Remind her...
...how Aryan travelled to Mumbai
for the first time
- WT
- Without ticket!
You want to give him the trophy?
Courier it. Post it
Papa, count the cash again
Phony fans cheer him from afar
But I'll hug him and hand him
the trophy myself
- Like this
- Have you gone mad?
Control the boy
Here. 20,000
Is your spit on the notes?
Socks, in the outside pocket.
Underwear, inside the bag
Any extra underwear? I'll have
no time to wash them
Here. Give this to him from
your Papa and me
Sohan halwa
Tell him your father got it
especially for him
- From Chandni Chowk
- Why tell him? I'll show him
I'll show Aryan a family selfie.
Come, we'll get the background
Mummy, hold the box.
I'll hold the trophy
Papa, hide those undies
- Cheese
- Cheese!
- Shall I drop you at the station?
- No, you go to the shop
- Can you manage?
- Sure
Don't overstay at Aryan's
I've only four days leave.
Can't extend
Don't worry, Papa. By mummy
Be careful, son
Where to?
Hi!
Your parents throw you out?
Keep dreaming about moving
to America
I'm off to meet Aryan,
face-to-face
Told Aryan you're coming?
He's my Aryan, not America.
No visa needed
I'm going to America to make a new
life. You'll get zero meeting Aryan
Forget it, you won't understand
Hello, uncle
Hello, aunty
Your ice cream
One vegetarian meal
Seat number?
I'll get it
If you want to stretch your legs
or your back, tell me
It's only one night. We'll adjust
Allow me
Now it's ok
Let me put uncle's plate down.
Don't worry
We're coming
Without ticket?
Uncle, it's a long story
Let me explain
I'll do the explaining. Call
Ratlam police station
Let him spend two days inside.
No more WT travelling
Uncle, you don't get it. I could've
bought the ticket
- I want to travel without one
- Come along
I'm not a thief or a criminal
You see tomorrow is
Aryan Khanna's birthday
No point if I get there late
Aryan Khanna?
Right! He went to Mumbai WT
Stayed at Hotel Delite.
Room number 205
I'll be staying there too.
Get the picture?
Let me get to Mumbai.
You won't lose anything
Here's the ticket money. Keep it
- But I'll travel WT
- Shut up!
You need a tight slap
Take him. He won't listen
Damn you!
Take me to Mumbai. Or I'll jump
You'll be answering the cops
all night
Want to die? Get back inside
If I can't see Aryan Khanna
on his birthday...
...no point living
Don't lose your head over
these film stars
He may be a film star to you.
But he's special to me
Give me your hand or you'll die
- Take me to Mumbai
- OK! Give me your hand
- One veg meal?
- Done. Give me your hand
Ok, hold me
Is he a relative? Do you
really know him?
Is he family? What are you
to Aryan Khanna?
A fan
Room 205 is occupied
Why? I've booked it
No bookings here
First come, first serve.
Pay cash, take the key
I'll pay double
But only room 205
If you don't give it to me,
just see what I'll do
Hey boy! Move the stuff from 205
to 209
Here, brother. Room 205 for you
Happy birthday, Senior
Let me pass, brother. I'm late.
Move it!
What a crowd! By God
Brother, move aside
The press over there
Let them come in
A selfie! Smile
Thank you
These two-faced fans
They moan about his films
And come here to pose with him
You can't go there
I'm not one of them. Those FB types.
Phony fans
I'm Gaurav Chandna
I've come from Delhi. WT.
Rajdhani Express
Guess where I'm staying?
Guess!
Hotel Delite. Room number 205
Don't you get it?
I'll show you magic
You'll enjoy it. Look!
When you count the night stars...
...and yearn to etch her name
on every star
You know you're in love
When her breath is carried
by the breeze...
Lets go press
You know you're in love
When you turn back as you walk ahead
Check the press IDs
Go inside
Not you! Don't you get it?
I want to show him my trophy
I just want him to see it.
Then I'll be gone
Moron!
If Aryan ever hears that
you hit me...
...he'll thrash you
It's ok. It's nothing
Mummy sent you special halwa
And this trophy...your birthday.
Mummy sent special halwa
Yes, Mummy?
I'm fine
Aryan is fine, too
I haven't met him yet. You're talking
like a child, Mummy
He's a superstar. How can
I just meet him?
There are thousands of people
here to meet him
They've built a 50 ft wall
in front of him
The poor guy is stuck alone behind it
Scream as hard as you want,
he can't hear
I'm hanging up. I'll call later
They say common sense deserts
a man in bad times
Seems that's Aryan Khanna's
fate now
In his twilight years, his films
are bombing
No surprise that he's on edge
and snappy
On his 48th birthday, he showed
his irritation...
...through his gift to Sid Kapoor
No star has matched Aryan till now
But Sid Kapoor...
...has pulled the rug
from under his feet
The party guests said...
Sid Kapoor just hinted that...
...Aryan Khanna's days were over
What did Kapoor tell Aryan Khanna...
...that made him hit Sid Kapoor?
I went to wish him happy birthday
Look what he did to me!
Totally out of order
He's an elder. I respect him a lot
I always say I've learned how
to act by watching his films
I don't know why I make him
insecure
What will you do?
Take legal action?
I should
I'll talk to my legal team
Let's see what they say.
It's my duty to do something
So no newcomer is mistreated
by a senior star
That's all I want to say
We'll talk after I've consulted
my legal team
Liar! Cheat
Playing the good boy on TV.
Anyone can see through you
You think he's insecure?
He's seen off dozens like you
No one has touched Aryan Khanna
for 25 years
Do your worst, sonny!
No one can touch him
Just you wait
Cut it!
Great shot
Superb!
- Liked it?
- Fantastic
Sid Kapoor! You swallowed
Aryan Khanna whole
What dialogue delivery!
You've destroyed Aryan Khanna.
Blew him away
I am your biggest fan, sir
At the contest back home...
It's my bad luck I look like Aryan,
but I always impersonate you
I win, sir
I've even won a trophy.
I love you, sir
Let me show you my trophy, sir.
Please...
- You let the girls through
- Let him come
Sir says yes
Sorry. Give me space
I'll show you my act?
Ok
The mind always outsmarts
the face, Mr. Singhania
You can ape someone
But you can't ape his mind
When all doors are shut
There's a knock at mind's door
And when that door opens,
you see a new road
I have walked that road to you,
Singhania
And through that very door
you shall walk to your peril
You're too good, fan
Well done, man
Relax man, calm down
I have the same jacket you're wearing
That's good. Very nice
- Sir's lunch break now
- One chance, sir
Santosh, bring me the salad
in half an hour
And this fan, come on!
Hear that?
- Sit down
- No, thank you
Sir, a small suggestion from a fan
Why fight with Aryan Khanna?
Why bother with the police
and police reports?
That's nothing, bro
I'll drag him to court
Allow me
Time's up for Aryan Khanna
- I'll wring your neck
- Santosh!
To hell with Santosh
Shut up! No one is coming
Close your mouth
Now listen... sit quietly...
Don't open your mouth again
to insult Aryan. One peep and...
I'll crush your chocolate face
with the wrapper
No fan will look at you again
Spouting pearls of wisdom on TV.
Look at my camera
Read! Here's the script.
Learn the lines
Do your rubbish acting
Your damn phone never
stops ringing
Now I'll see
Read it!
Start
It's in Hindi, dude
You're a Hindi film hero
and you can't read Hindi?
Where do they find you guys?
What do you film people say?
Action!
Dear Aryan sir
I'm really very sorry
My statement to the press
was all lies
I wanted to spoil your name
No one can take your place.
You're the best
The greatest, the most evergreen
super-duper star
I apologise again
Think of me as your kid brother
and forgive me
Why won't he play with you?
Shall I tell him to?
Dad, he bullies me
He bullies you because
he's scared of you
He thinks you'll win. We'll cheat!
- Dhruv, let's play
- Dad, come on
Play with Isha. I've trained her
- I am so sorry
- Dad, you made me lose a point
Now she's ahead of you.
Try and win from her
I'm glad Sid realised his mistake.
He's a great guy. Young and new
Glad it got sorted
Ladies and gentlemen,
last point, next point
Nothing is sorted, it's a game
Apology, say sorry - it's all a game
You should've controlled yourself
I tried very hard
I gave him one slap. More a pat
See the scandal it's created
If someone comes to my house,
drinks my expensive wine
Flirts with my wife. Must I just
stand by and watch?
You have no time
Let someone else flirt with me
Actually you're right
But not this moron
The video has gone viral.
Social media is abuzz
Join us for the stock market news
after this short break
Aryan, wake up!
What happened?
Did you sleep here all night?
I was reading a script. It was
so good that I dozed off
Sunaina is here. She has something
to wake you up with
Good morning, Aryan
It's too early, Sunaina
I know. I'm really sorry.
I have to tell you something
- Are you pregnant?
- Shut up, Aryan
See this
Come on. Look here and say
your lines. Hurry
Dear Aryan sir
Look here. Look at the camera
Ok. I'll do it
- Come on
- Did Aryan send you?
Aryan has nothing to do with it.
Do as you're told. The camera
If you want cash, take it.
Just let me go
Cash? I'll give you cash
Stop! I'll do it
What will you do? Scum!
A fan
Calls himself Junior Aryan Khanna
He sent a message
A small birthday gift to the love
of my life, Senior Aryan Khanna
Call me once to thank me.
My life will be set
Hello
Junior Aryan Khanna?
You calling from Aryan's house?
Yes
Where is Senior? Aryan Khanna?
He's busy right now. He asked me
to call you
How come he's so busy?
No time to talk to his Junior?
I did so much for him
I came to the house on his birthday,
The crowd...
Yeah, yeah, hello
Aryan...
Aryan Khanna?
Gaurav this side.
Your fan, your Junior
Where are you?
Just guess
Delite hotel, in your room
Room no. 205. Charni Road.
Remember?
But if you're calling to say
thank you, it won't do
I deserve a hug from my brother
- You want to see me?
- Sure
I made a big scandal just to meet you
Wait there. I'll send a car to
pick you up
Done, Senior
Thank you!
Mind blasting
Really?
Go by taxi
You're going to Aryan Khanna's.
Don't go by auto-rickshaw
He's sending me his personal car
He's invited me home
Don't forget to take pictures
If he offers you any food, no
pouncing on it like a pauper
Food? I'm not going for the food.
I'm going there to hug him
Tell him to wear the clothes I had
made for him at Diwali
- Make sure he takes the trophy
- As though he wouldn't
- Say hello from me
- And me, too
Ok. I'll tell him
Phone me once you've met him
The car's here. Call you later
The car is there
Hello
Are you the driver?
Junior Aryan Khanna?
- Did you act smart with Sid Kapoor?
- No
You're mistaken
Did Sid Kapoor send you?
I'll tell you later. Come
I'm meeting Aryan.
I won't go anywhere
- Like hell you won't
- I won't come
Don't touch me
No touching
Let me go!
Stop!
Try catching me!
- Stop! You rascal
- Please don't hit me
Don't hit hard. We have orders
Let's go
Let me call Aryan Khanna
Where are you taking me?
Sid Kapoor is evil. Don't get
mixed up with him
Shut up!
I did it for Aryan Khanna.
His problem is my problem
If Aryan hears about this...
...he'll skin you alive
Stop!
Think carefully. We'll be back.
Let's go
Good evening, sir. Come in
We asked him why he made the video
He says he'll talk only to you
You told us to go easy on him
- Hardly touched him
- Thank you
- Usman
- Yes, sir?
This is for his expenses
Keep him here for 2 days
Get him a ticket to Delhi.
Take him to the station
As I said, don't beat him up
too badly
Just enough to scare him
No one must hear about this
No police record, no video statement.
Please
Sure, sir
Where is he?
I want to meet him alone
- You stay here
- Yeah
Gaurav
Senior
You're here
I knew you'd come
They hit me and hit me
They broke my bones
I protected my face
It's Aryan Khanna's face.
Nothing must happen to it
See? Same to same
Everyone calls me Junior
Aryan Khanna. But I say...
...there's only one Aryan Khanna
Relax
It's ok
I impersonate you at the yearly
Super Star competition
Always win first prize
The bastards took my bag.
My trophy was in it
I brought it to show you
I could show you my act
I'm nervous in front of you
It's all right. Sit
No audience here. Their screaming
and cheering helps
- Are you from Delhi?
- West Delhi
You're from Rajender Nagar,
I'm from Inder Vihar
Two traffic lights from the TV tower.
Near DAV Park
Listen carefully
You did something nasty
It's a crime
A crime in the eyes of the law.
Love in your eyes, no?
Not love, it's stupidity
Do you have family?
There's Papa, Mummy
And you, too
Have you thought what
your parents would say?
They'd be sad seeing you
in that sadistic video
Why would we show it to them?
It was for you
Did you like my birthday gift?
Sid Kapoor? I beat the crap
out of him
I don't understand how the cops
discovered our little secret
Our?
There is no our between
you and me
The police brought you here
on my orders
You made a mistake. You
had to be punished
So you won't mess up again
On your orders? I did so much for you
Who are you to do anything
for me?
I'm your fan
- You're my star
- Fan? So you do as you please?
Thrash people? Murder?
If need be, I could murder for you
You're not my fan
Don't say that
I risked my life to meet you
I hit Sid Kapoor a little, so you'd
meet me. What did I want...
...in return?
To see you, a few photos,
an autograph. That's all
- Can't you spare 5 min of your life?
- It's my life
Why must I give you even
five seconds?
I am who I am today,
where I am today
My stardom
It's all thanks to my fans
If it weren't for my fans...
I'd be nothing
Gaurav makes Aryan
Without Gaurav...
...Aryan is nothing
Now you listen carefully
When the police let you go,
go straight to Delhi, get it?
I'll forget all about Gaurav
And you forget you ever met Aryan
Stay in your life.
I stay in mine
This is your final warning. Ok
Forget it
You won't understand
Yes, Mummy
I'll be home soon
Everything ok?
Everything is fine
Why didn't you take my call?
I was busy
Gaurav, we're worried about you
Don't worry
You'll come home soon?
Tell Papa to mind the Cyber Cafe
Are you eating properly?
The food is fine here
Thank you
Come, hero. Sir wants you
Whatever happened has happened.
Put it behind you. Right?
Thank you, brother. I made
a mistake. Sorry
Gaurav!
Did you hug Aryan Khanna?
Didn't he meet you?
Didn't spare 5 minutes?
Don't you feel bad
It's not my loss. It's his
He's happy where he is.
I'm happy where I am
Mummy, make me some
rice and beans tonight
Hello, aunty
You're moving out?
Who knows what this boy wants
Got a good price?
Don't worry, Papa. I'll invest wisely
Too much time wasted on Aryan
The shop is sold, Mummy.
Let's go
Hurry. You coming?
- Let's go
- Ok, come
All well, aunty?
Fans chase stars
Now a star will chase a fan
Whenever Aryan Khanna's name
is taken...
...it'll be in the same breath
as Gaurav Chandna
Welcome to Bollywood Caf.
Do you know what's special
about the weekend?
Guys, this weekend...
...is the Aryan Khanna reloaded
show presented by Hyundai
Stars have a great life
I want a life like Aryan's
Full on, jet setter!
One day in London, Dubrovnik the next
For the grand Bhutiani wedding
Then back to the London show
Wow!
Do you know London is
one of his favourite places?
In fact he considers it his
second home after Mumbai
We have some good news
and some bad news
The bad news first, obviously
The Hyundai Aryan Khanna reloaded
show is houseful
Oh no! What's the good news?
We have 20 free tickets
for our listeners
Who ever is the first to answer
my question correctly...
...wins a free show ticket
My question follows straight after
this beautiful song
Here's your tickets. Enjoy your visit
- How can I help you?
- One ticket please
Enjoy your visit
The real drama starts now
Aryan Khanna!
Mr. Khanna, Tim Baker,
the Manager
Aryan Khanna, the actor
I hope it's not a bother
Fans never bother
Sir, a photo with your wax figure
Let me say this. It's amazing
You've come all the way to London...
...to take a photo with
my wax figure
Really, that's very sweet.
Is this better?
Better now?
Let me warn you
I was much younger then
You like it?
Honestly...
...it's very scary
So, does he look like me?
- You look great in real life
- Exactly, darling
I agree. What a fat nose he has
My nose is tiny
A phony face
A fake smile
All phony
I don't smile like this
Actually no one smiles like this
His hair smells bad.
Feels bad, looks bad
In fact, I don't look like him at all
This is a fake
Aryan Khanna is a fake
I want a refund. Aryan Khanna
is a fake
This isn't right. You can't do this
to our property
The white man claims
my face is his property
Mr. Property Agent. This is me
My face, my property
- Stop now and leave, sir
- I won't leave
It's a joke. You guys can't
take a joke
Come here. Come
Who can stop me?
I'll shoot you all
I don't understand what
you're talking about
You are gonna be in a lot
of trouble over this
Really?
You are in trouble too
Stay out of my way! I'll shoot
You alright?
Aryan...
What?
Come out
What are you saying?
Arrest warrant for you
What the hell is this?
I didn't go to Madame Tussauds
- The Indian Ambassador on line
- I'm not talking to any Ambassador
I'm here to arrest him
Sir, Mr. Khanna did not go to
Madame Tussauds...
Are you Mr. Khanna?
Then just shut up and let me
do my job
Excuse me. So you are doing
your job and we are faffing?
Must say you have a very polite way
of talking to women, Mr. Duncan
Guess what?
It's my turn to be polite now
This, sir, is nonsense
Where were you between
- I was at home
- And who were you with?
I was alone
Did anyone see you at home?
I just told you I was alone
Aryan, I'll call our lawyer
Can you talk in a language
we all can understand?
Let me translate it in a language
you understand
Lawyer
Two options
Handcuffs if you are nasty,
without handcuffs if you are nice
Nasty
Just five minutes
You stay here
Just five minutes sir, please
Let's call Akhtar
What happened?
Lost your funny bone?
That's not me
Behaves like you
Looks like you
Everybody calls this person
by your name
I said that's not me
You have any proof?
Say something, Mr. Superstar
Not to you, Mr. Small-Time cop
Not a word without my lawyer
Suit yourself
Till he comes out with the truth
- You can't do that
- Sure, I can
Sir, one photograph please?
- You have a safe trip, sir
- Yeah, I will be
It's time. Lets go
DUBROVNIK
In Croatian, we say - How are you?
I'm fine
My name is Gaurav
Thank you
Vegetable sandwich... one
Which one do you want?
This one?
Ok. Here we go
No, no, more. Six more
It's ok. Here
Thank you
Thanks
It's only bail
We know you're lying
Why would I waste my lies on you?
That was no imposter.
You twisted psycho
We'll have you back
in jail in no time
Please do that
Maybe I'll earn some money suing you
and the entire British police
Aryan, control your temper
It's their city, their country
Don't make matters worse
for yourself
So we're done with all
the formalities?
Thanks a lot
Pathetic fool
I'm coming with you to Dubrovnik
in case of any immigration problem
Hey! Not that way
The press is outside
Aryan, this is Deputy High
Commissioner, Mr. Murthy
Pleased to meet you
Sorry you had to go through
all this but...
We can't interfere very much
This is a foreign country after all
I know. Rules in every country
are made to get the innocent
Sir, we're diplomats, not detectives
Before the case is solved, we have
permission for you to travel
Now we can only do that much
It's a serious matter.
A diplomatic issue
So you must prove it wasn't you
at Madame Tussauds
Must I prove it? Ok, I'll play cop
I really appreciate your help
Thank you
Thank you, sir
In jail or dancing at a wedding...
...these stars are so arrogant
Your home CCTV footage has saved us.
It's with the police
It proves an impostor was at Madame
Tussauds and you were at home
Who is he? What's his motive
Forget the London cops
Find out. We need to get this guy
We'll know more back in London
So you know you can
really relax now
Wine? Champagne? Anything?
Everything
Come on, Aryan. It's over now
Sir, a call
He says he knows the imposter
at Madame Tussauds
- Give me the phone. I'll talk
- He'll only talk to sir
He won't give me his name
Give it to me
Hello
Senior
Chandna?
I won't let you forget my name
It'll be taken in the same breath
as your name
What do you want?
The stage is set
Tell everyone - admit what you did
was wrong
You'll never break a fan's heart
again. Say sorry
Stop this nonsense! I'm not
apologising to anyone
I tried to make you see sense
If you had agreed to give me
I would have my life.
You would have yours
But you had to prove you had
star power
Now you'll see a fan's power
I'm a star
I took your pranks as childishness.
Threw you inside for only 2 days
If I knew the real you,
you'd still be inside
In 48 hours you snatched away
my devotion of 25 years
If you don't say sorry...
...in the next 48 hours,
your stardom is over
Do what you want
I've seen off dozens like you
The higher you fly, the harder
I'll make you fall
But you must fly as high as me,
Gaurav Chandna
Impossible for you
We'll see how far you get
impersonating me
I don't need to go far
You're getting closer to me.
In Dubrovnik
Idiot. He's in Dubrovnik
Unknown caller, unknown location
Obviously, Sunaina. He won't
call from a traceable number
Say sorry. It's no big deal
He's mad
Is that so? And what am I?
Is the make-up team in place?
They are on there way
Oh great. The props, fireworks,
confetti all that
We've done a couple of rehearsals.
Everything's perfect
Ok. Thank you
Aryan asked for a background
check of all the staff members
- Is it done yet?
- It's going on right now
Ok. Thank you
Nicksi Jelopera
- Medium?
- Medium size
You're so late, Aryan Khanna.
It's just not done
I apologise. I'm extremely sorry,
Mr. Bhutiani
I had a crisis, I'm sorry
You celebrities always have
some crisis
But my daughter doesn't
get married everyday
- I know. I'm sorry
- You've no idea
That stunt you pulled in London has
caused me great loss of face
No, Mr. Bhutiani
What happened at Madame Tussauds...
You know what? I'll make
it up to you
I swear. Your guests will always think
of the grand Bhutiani wedding
They better do
After all I'm spending
a bomb on you
Only you can. I'll get ready
Sunaina, find out where
the CCTV cameras are
Usman, watch the guest areas,
the bars, the toilets, the corridors
- Keep an eye on everyone
- Excuse me, sir
I'm really sorry to interrupt but
we just have 2 minutes
I don't need two, darling.
Let's go, I'm ready
Good luck
Payal, tell me the names
Is Bhutiani's son-in-law called
Amul Mirchandani?
It's Anmol Mirchandani
Guys, all the best. Break
a leg and do well
And sisters Anushka, Deepshika?
That's for later, it's all here
Second entry dance 5,6,7,8.
You're giving it to me
- Sir, your shades
- Thank you, Payal
Ok guys. You have 30 seconds
to go
All the best, just kill it
Check all entries and exits
Ok, Sunaina
Find anything?
Not yet, sir. I've spoken to the team,
no one enters without an invite
Sir, your cue cards
Can you go to cam 4
When you count the night stars...
...and yearn to etch her name
on every star
You know you're in love
When you want to turn back
as you walk ahead
When you look for her in a crowd,
you know you're in love
Say sorry
Check the crew's photos
He's not a guest. He's crew.
Quick
Got it
Sorry
There. Zoom in
Check the crew backstage
Copy
Payal, we need the crew ids.
Photographs and bio-datas
- Anything serious, sir?
- Aryan wants to know
Sorry
It's fine
The crew is local
Except one guy. Half Indian,
half Croatian
Akhtar is sending you a photo
of him
Keep a close eye
Round up all the crew
- Any sign of him?
- Sir, nothing
He's not responding
Sunaina
Can't see him on any camera
- But I'm at it
- What are you at it?
Where is there no CCTV camera?
Your make-up room
Careful, sir
Gaurav makes Aryan
You're very stubborn.
You don't listen to me
Why are you hiding?
Talk face-to-face
I stand face-to-face, Aryan Khanna
But you never see me
Now when I'm not there, you're
longing to see me
I know the feeling
I felt it among the crowd
in front of your house
Sir, the Bhutianis are waiting.
The audience interaction...
Yeah. I'm coming
- I'll take care of it
- Thank you
I'll come back and see you.
Hi sweetheart
Hope you enjoyed the show
- Aryan, it was marvelous
- Thank you
That's my daughter
She's been practicing a step to
dance with you for two months
Actually we were both practicing
How pretty is she
You know what? Let me start
with the young one
...and I'll come back
for the experience
We've found Chandna
In the corridor, across from where
you're dancing
I'm not dancing
Chandna is on the dance floor
What the hell is wrong with him?
I was dancing. He started touching me
here, there, everywhere
I don't know. You'll have
to do something
- Get him out
- I don't care
What the hell are you doing?
Mr. Bhutiani?
- Where do you think you are?
- Calm down, Mr. Bhutiani
- What happened?
- That girl is like my daughter
Is this how you film stars behave?
I'm really sorry, ladies.
I'm sorry
I'll explain. The guy who was
here wasn't me
- Nonsense
- It was somebody else
I'm Aryan Khanna
- I'm Aryan Khanna
- What nonsense!
You known me for years
I love you guys. I'd never
harm you people
That person wasn't me
I suggest you leave
Keep back!
Stop the car!
No one has given me the
interaction script
Is there a delay?
What?
The show's cancelled
They've boycotted the show
Sponsors have also pulled out
Nobody came, not a soul
Whats wrong with you?
You wimp
Watch where you're going?
Media playing up the story
The wedding video has gone viral
Given Khanna's status, he must
take responsibility for his actions
Is he attention-seeking?
Movie stars forget that one day
they'll be has-beens
Stars must go through traumas.
Look at what his done
It's a crime if an ordinary man
misbehaves...
...if it's a star - it's a stunt.
Why these double standards...
...for stars? A criminal is
a criminal
Hello
Hello, sir. It's me, Aryan.
I'm calling from London
I know you are in London,
but what's going on?
A Delhi boy is impersonating me,
committing crimes
We have to arrest him
But the crimes are committed
outside of India
We can't arrest him. It's not
in our jurisdiction
Must we wait till he commits
a crime in India?
His name is Gaurav Chandna
Find me his Delhi address.
It will help
You don't teach me my job
But who shall we arrest?
You're the accused, Aryan
I just...
Come back to India
Then we'll look into the matter with
the proper procedure. OK?
Hello
What did he say?
Organise a press conference
first thing tomorrow
- In Mumbai?
- No, here in London
You now have the video footage
and all the documents, etc
You have proof...
...that Aryan Khanna did not
commit these crimes
You're angry with me, and you
have the right to be
But believe me
That dangerous and evil face
you see on TV is not me
That person is not me
So please give me time
Time, so that I can prove
I've done nothing wrong
I'd never do anything that
would make you ashamed...
...to call me your star
Whatever I am...
I just want to say, I would
never do anything like this
Thank you
Sir, do you know this impostor?
Have you met him?
Sorry. We can't talk now.
The case is under trial
What about the imposter's name?
As soon as we have proof,
you'll be the first to know
Are you the real Aryan Khanna
or the imposter?
You find this funny? A big joke?
If this happened to a girl in your
family would you still be grinning?
A woman was molested and
you find it's funny?
And one more thing
This press meet is not
to prove my innocence
I want to warn you all
The man who's impersonating me,
spoiling my name
He can hurt anyone, anytime
So please be careful
Thank you everybody.
Thanks for coming
Aryan has a flight to catch, he's
going back to India
So have a great day and
see you soon
MUMBAI
Don't stop, go from behind
Open up!
One minute, sir. Madam said we must
inform her
Good. Hurry up
Before the journalists outside mob me
Hello
Ma'am, can sir come in?
No, wait a second
- Are you sure it's him?
- It sounds like sir
Ask him to face the camera
Sir, ma'am wants you to step forward
Hi, I am Aryan Khanna. Height 5'10.
Black hair, black eyes
A big nose
School: Kendriya Vidyalaya,
New Delhi
Hans Raj College, Delhi University
Give me the phone, quick!
The press will surround me
Let me in. Or I'll end up
in their arms
Why is your phone off?
Can I tell you inside?
Open the door
Guys. Dad's here
Aryan, you're back?
- Hi
- Hi
- You're back
- Yes, I'm back
Are the kids asleep?
Yes. It's way past their bedtime
Of course
Let them sleep
Let's relax and talk quietly
in our room
Yes
- What an entrance exam!
- You passed with flying colours
I spent my life preparing
for this moment
Relax. Make yourself a drink.
I'll run the shower for you
Of course
She was crying. Not easy getting
her to sleep again
It's better for us both if Isha
stays asleep
I did say...
...we could talk calmly
Why do you need that?
Give
I have nothing against you
or your children
Give me that
Senior ignores me
You can't let him do that
Show me Aryan's study, he's
always talking about it
Sound asleep
Come, come
Sit. He lands in 20 minutes.
I haven't much time
Come on, sit down
This room has so many stories
Many stories behind these awards
In these costumes
Days that Aryan does not want
to forget
Memories he wants to keep close
to his heart
I treasured his memories too
Kept them right here
At home, on the walls of my room,
in cupboards
On shelves like these
Aryan Khanna filled every corner
of my life
But he ended it all
Five minutes! I asked him for
only five minutes
Know what he said?
It's my life
Why must I give you even
five seconds of it?
- I apologise on his behalf
- Why should you apologise?
I hit Sid Kapoor for his sake
He was hassling Aryan
What did Aryan do? Threw me in jail.
Had me beaten
Said: It's a crime! A crime?
Crime is what I'll do now
Breaking hearts of fans who are
devoted to you...
...is a crime too
You tell me
Am I so wrong?
When he fights with you,
doesn't he say sorry?
So, why can't he say sorry to me?
Tell me!
Don't do this. I beg you
What do you mean please?
He left nothing for me. Why must
I leave anything for him?
How can I? Impossible
A sham. All lies
Liar. He's a fake
The rascal acts all the time
An actor after all
I wanted to give him my trophy
A belated happy birthday,
Aryan Khanna
Open the door!
I sent the children to my parents
They were terrified. I didn't know
what to tell them
Isha asked me repeatedly: Why did
Papa destroy the study?
Don't worry. It's ok
- Why don't we call the police?
- The police will do nothing
They'll ask for proof. They believe
I'm the criminal
I came this far in life
on my own steam
I'll handle it myself
Play rough like a street hoodlum
I'll rip him apart. Send him back
to where he belongs
Gaurav Chandna has seen my star face
Now he'll see my real face
I'm a Delhi man too
The dangerous and evil face
on the news is not me
That person is not me.
Give me time
I'll prove I've done nothing wrong
I'd never do anything to make you
ashamed calling me your star
Aryan Khanna's press conference
proves that he is innocent
A criminal is impersonating him
and committing crimes
Who is the culprit? His name?
His whereabouts?
No one knows the motives
behind his terrible actions
The police have informed us that
they're very hopeful...
...this criminal will not escape them
When he's arrested, he'll be
severely punished
Hello, Gauru
Mummy
What's wrong with your phone?
Where are you, Gauru?
Right here
I'm ok
And you?
Son, come home soon.
We're in trouble
You've roamed the world, now return
to your home
Aryan?
You barged into my home?
You can barge into mine, can't I
do the same?
I came here to grab your
parents by the throat
To ask why they produced
a nasty son like you
- But I am not a lowlife like you
- Don't drag my parents into this
They did nothing
What did my kids do?
I went alone into your fortress.
Did you bring an army?
I am here alone, Gaurav Chandna
No security, no secretary.
No star, no hero
If you have the guts, face me
Settle the score
The score will only be settled
when you apologise
Get on the stage at the Inder Vihar
contest and say sorry
And listen...
If you touch my parents with
a feather even...
I know your mother-in-law's house,
where your children are hiding
Your daughter is very cute, by God
- Your son is stubborn like you
- You rascal
I'll bury you in a gutter here, if you
dream of harming my kids
What will my parents think?
Such a big star...
...with such a foul tongue
Forget it
See you at the contest
Your son has lost his mind
- He's crossed the line
- Our Gaurav was not like that
He was a good boy
He changed after meeting you
What would you have lost
if you gave him 5 mins?
Don't blame Aryan
It's our fault
We let him get obsessed by
your glamorous life
Not your hard slog. He would've
followed your example
Worked hard and become someone
Then the call center girl could've
become his girlfriend or wife
He has a girlfriend?
A one-way romance.
Gaurav loves her but...
Enough. We have to accept things
the way they are
- Where's the contest held?
- The other end of the colony
Apologise. End this terrible situation
You think I'm wrong too?
And I must apologise?
Arrest him
He must be punished
Imprison him for years, if you must
But don't beat him
Please
Hey Junior. Where were you?
- Hello Uncle, Aunty
- Hello
Have you been watching the
news on TV about Aryan?
Never mind
I have good news for you all
I've got my American visa
I knew it
Why is he standing with his back
to me? It's not like him
He's going on stage soon,
he's just nervous
Him? And nervous?
Has he done anything in life
besides copying Aryan?
Hey Superstar, your make-up...
Neha
I have to talk to you
Super surprise!
Western Union - moving money
for better
Now for the last act of the
Super Star competition
Our favourite winner
Our Junior Aryan Khanna
He's a criminal!
Get him off the stage
Calm down
It's not the real Aryan Khanna
It's our very own superstar...
Gaurav Chandna
Give him a big hand!
I do a show for Aryan every year
I know, Aunty. You cheer the loudest
But this year's show...
The show today is for...
...someone else
The girl over there who is...
...smiling at me. She's my friend
Neha!
Come, babes
There's something I've kept
in my heart for days
I love you, Neha
- I love you too, Aryan
- Not Aryan
Gaurav loves you
Gaurav loves Neha
What nonsense!
Get lost
- He's nuts
- Thinks he's real Aryan Khanna
Get him off
Wait! He is talking to me.
I'll deal with it
I love you!
Drop it. You love only Aryan
He can go to hell
- Is that you talking?
- It's not just talk
I've sent him to hell
I fixed Aryan Khanna for good
First in London, then in Dubrovnik
I made my way into his house too
Smashed everything in sight
If you don't believe me, read the
papers. Watch TV or the Net
Your Gaurav is famous the world over
I'm no less than Aryan
Not at all
I am a star in real life
Not a star. A monster
What?
They all think you're a star
While you shamed Inder Vihar
Listen to her
I became a monster for her
I don't want to know a monster
A monster! Forget it
Take my hand and say:
I love you too
- Let go
- I won't
I'm very sorry, Neha
Are you ok?
Thank you
Aryan. He's a good guy
Gaurav!
Get down!
Enough!
Enough of this game
Get up!
I am happy in my life
Can't you be happy in yours?
Be a good son to your parents
A good friend, a good boyfriend
Stop being a fan
What's the difference between us?
I came from the same streets
I had normal parents like you
A regular house, regular school,
regular friends
I made my way up alone
Not in anyone's shadow
I'm human
I laugh and cry, get mad like you.
I have a family. Responsibilities
I don't have the time to meet
all my fans
I'll say it again
I'll forget all this
You do the same
Start over
Not as Junior Aryan Khanna
See how it feels like to be
Gaurav Chandna
Come!
The joy of living as yourself...
...cannot be matched by living
as another
Stop now
Live your life
Let me live mine
Where to, Senior?
You destroyed me and ask me
to let you live your life?
And my life?
You took everything from me
My parents' love
Neha's friendship
My neighbours' smiles
You were my lifeline, Senior
You cut the connection
OK. I'll do as you say
I'll stop this game
I can separate myself from you
But you can never separate
my name from yours
You said everything
But you never said sorry
Gaurav!
No, Gaurav
It's not over
Think of your parents
Stop this madness
Forget it. You won't understand
Aryan Khanna has cleared
his name completely
But Inder Vihar's Gaurav Chandna...
...has tied his name to superstar
Aryan's name forever
A wave of love greets Aryan's
on his birthday today
Fans are singing his songs. They're
here in their thousands
It's time
Everyone is waiting
