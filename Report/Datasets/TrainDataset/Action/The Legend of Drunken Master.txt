You must declare all items.
Undeclared items
will be confiscated.
Cho, declare the ginseng
to customs.
Why, Pop? They make us pay
I know.
What ifI just hide it
in my pants?
They'll never know.
Brilliant, Fei-Hong.
Betteryet,
why don't we have
the master hold onto it?
They'll never search him
because he's
too respectable.
What doyou think?
Ha ha ha!
Very good idea.
You're hopeless--
both ofyou.
Bad idea.
I'll not hear any more
ofyour nonsense.
I just don't understand
whywe have to pay duties
on everything we buy.
I don't care whatyou say.
Just listen to me.
Avoid trouble.
Pay the duties, that's it.
I know best.
Soldier: Back, back.
Back. Make way.
Let the ambassador through.
What's going on?
Now watch it.
It's the ambassador
and he deserves respect.
He's treated like royalty.
He doesn't have
to pay any duties.
How about that one?
Wow. He's a lucky one.
Man::
Nopushing: Don'tpush:
Everybodyback:
Let thesepeople through!
Ay!
Oh, no.
Hey, areyou all right?
Let's go.
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
What happened?
Shut up.
Someone push him.
Huh?
Please, sir, I apologize.
Listen, Fei-Hong.
Fei-Hong, why did you
give him our ginseng?
We don't have to pay tax.
Once we get on the train,
I'll look for the box.
Ah, what a terrific idea.
What's that?
You could throw me
down again
and I'll hide some more.
Here I go.
Here I go.
Aah!
Cho:: Ooh:
He must've tripped.
Look atyou.
You're so clumsy.
Come on, get up.
File in!
Wow, what a crowd.
Why don'tyou go get a seat
and I'll pay the taxes.
All right, son.
I'll seeyou on board.
Ifyou have nothing
to declare,
begin boarding right now.
Cho::
Here, Fei-Hong, take this:
Got it.
Come on.
Fei-Hong, great.
Wong::Easy, easy:
Be careful.
You'll crush everything.
Wong::
That'sgood:
Hold it.
Hey, where areyou going?
Stop!
Come back! Fei-Hong!
Wong::
Fei-Hong, lethimgo!
Fei-Hong,
forget about him!
Come back here.
Come back.
Fei-Hong,
now, let me remind you.
A hero lives
but a few seconds.
A master holds
onto his life.
But he stoleyourwallet.
And I took it back.
That's not the issue.
The point is,
the stronger man knows...
It's more important to
forgive than it is to fight.
That's right.
What was I thinking?
Uhh.
Your turn.
How about this?
Hey, you know better than that.
But there's no other move.
Try it again.
Try it again.
Hey, look at the white crane.
Wow. Haveyou ever
seen one like that?
It's still your play.
Come on.
Can we start over?
You still have a chance.
Where? I don't see it.
It'snotfair:
Youalways win:
Ready?
Oh, God!
Cho::Damnit!
Uhh...
Areyou OK?
Oh...
I bet that hurt.
I'm sorry, sir.
- Wong::Is thisyours?
- I'm afraidso:
Be more careful.
Shh.
Yes, sir.
Ready?
Ready.
Wong::
Fei-Hong, what's this?
We call it cheating.
You've only got 1 0 minutes,
so hurry up.
Woman:
Come on, we ain't got all day!
Oh, the ginseng--
time to find it.
Oh, yeah. Good idea.
Father, forget about this.
Let me go find something
you're really going to like.
Ha ha. I don't think
I'm ready to eat,
but I thankyou.
Come on, how about
a nice roasted chicken?
We can find him one.
How about it, huh?
Look, I can seeyou two
want to look around a bit.
It's OK.
I'll be fine here.
- Go on.
- Come on.
Wong: Hey...
you two stay out oftrouble,
you hear me?
You make sure
you come right back.
Pardon me.
Excuse me.
Pardon me.
Sorry, sorry.
God, doyou believe
the smell ofthis place?
I think I'm going
to be sick.
God.
Hey, this way.
Wow.
The vegetation's much nicer.
Yes, I see.
It's making me hungry.
Maybe we could grab a roll.
Hey!
What areyou doing here?
- Nothing.
- Nothing.
You thinkyou have reservations?
Yeah, yeah, we do.
Go on back.
Check inside.
I've had enough. Go on.
One more time,
and you're offthe train.
So what do we do now?
I got an idea.
Now what?
Just watch me.
Go!
Man:: Goaway!Goaway!
Look out!
They've gone wild!
Here. Hold this.
-
- Stop him!
Fire! Fire!
Woman::Aah!
Sorry, sir. Huh?
Wait.
Hey!
He...
Man::I'msure
he came this way:
Hey, stop!
Hey, you!
- Guard:: Whereyougoing?
- Whereyou going?
Hey, you.
Wait. Whyyou hit--
- I kill you!
- Oh!
There. Traitor.
A what?
Hot tea, sir?
Man:
Hot tea for sale.
Thankyou.
You leave me alone!
Yaah!
Next time,
I cutyour throat...
Traitor.
You.
Fei-Hong:
Hey, listen!
I'm not a traitor,
you hear me? You--
Then what are we
fighting about?
Don't play games.
You hit me.
Yaah!
Where'd he go?
Hey!
Hmm.
Back again?
Why don'tyou give up?
Oh, no, old man.
Apologize.
What did you say?
How dareyou
call me a traitor.
OK. Sorry.
Fine, but I still
oweyou one.
Here.
Hey, show respect.
Stand still.
Respect toyou?
You must be kidding me.
Let's make this fair.
Huhh.
Ready?
Ah, drunken boxing.
That's right.
I'm the master.
You think so?
Again.
Come on.
- Let's go.
- You come.
You know...
a kid likeyou
isn't worth my time.
I showyou!
Tiger Slash At Bear!
Quail!
Huh?
What doyou call that one?
Ha. It's called
Turtle Holding Wild Bear.
Catch the Bouquet!
Eagle Catch the Rabbit!
Down the Hatch!
- Hmm.
- Drunk Plays the Flute?
* Da da da da da da da *
Fei-Hong::
**Lala la la la la la**
**Deela da da
la la la la la la--**
Uhh.
And this one?
Nursing a Hangover.
OK...
stand up.
Your kung fu is pretty good.
Young man, you're not
too bad yourself,
but that drunken boxing wasn't--
Impressed?
Basically, it's slow,
and you have no power.
It's pathetic.
What?
I can defeat any kung fu.
I showyou power.
That's nice,
butyou're out oftime.
Time? I'm young and strong.
I've got lots oftime.
Butyour train's
leaving over there.
Nice try, old man,
but nowyou're going to get it.
Ay. All right, kid.
Come back here!
Oh, no, the train!
Fei-Hong: Wait for me!
Come on, give meyour hand.
Hey, thanks a lot.
Get whatyou were after?
Good fortune toyou!
Ah, the ginseng.
Ah.
Ginseng?
All right,
everyone here get up.
Gatheryour luggage
for inspection.
Guard::
Everyone, now: Come on:
You.
Wake up.
Good morning.
What areyou doing?
Something has been stolen,
and we're going to find it.
Guard...

All right, what is all that?
Guard:
You, take it out.
Hurry up.
Cho, open this. Fei-Hong.
Let me see.
Bear claw.
What else? Come on.
Green toad.
Guard::Next:
Wong::
Deerhorn, ginseng--
What's that?
The oneyou dropped.
Open that.
This one?
What's that?
Fried yak.
- Guard:: OK, next:
- Fei-Hong: Shit.
Nowthe otherbox:
Come on:
Letmesee the otherbox:
Acorn.
Not that--that.
Let me see that one.
Not that one.
The one over there.
Fei-Hong:: Which one?
Guard::

Fei-Hong::
This?No, no, no: Thatone:
He means the ginseng.
He wasn't hiding it.
Well, then open it up.
Guard::
Whatareyou waiting for?
Open thatbox!
Right now!
Excuse me, sir...
these gentlemen are clearly
physicians from Hunan.
Why don'tyou
give them a break, huh?
I don't give breaks.
I give orders.
Guard::
Showmeyourpapers:
Come on, let'ssee them:
Here.
Sir, my apologies.
Shh.
Sir.
He's with Counterintelligence.
John::
He's with the centralgovernment:
Betternotchallenge
hisauthority:
Guard::
Allright, nextcar:
- Search up there.
- Next car.
I'm amazed theywould think
we would steal anything.
It is such an insult.
Yeah.
Put that away.
Doyou all realize
what this means?
They certainlywon't buy
the rest ofthe shipment
without it.
You know,
I'm truly astounded
at the incompetence
ofall ofyou.
You severely damaged
my reputation
with the British
Museum ofArt.
They've asked me
to deliver
thejade seal
ofthe emperor,
and I have every intention
offulfilling that request.
I don't care
howyou do it.
I want it back.
Both: Yes, sir.
We thinkwe know
who the thiefis, sir.
Get him.
Yes, sir.
John...
we're having
a bit oftrouble
with the workers
at the steel factory.
I trustyou'll deal with it.
Ofcourse, sir.
I knowjust what to do
in this situation.
I promiseyou'll have
no more trouble.
Let's make sure.
Yes, sir.
Uhh!
Ancestors be blessed.
Ha!
It's grand slam.
Women: Aw...
Ha ha ha!
Let's go, let's go.
Come on, come on, pay up, pay up.
Quickly.
We haven't got all day.
Go and see
who is at the door.
Come on.
Money. Ha ha ha!
That's the way.
More. Nowyour turn.
Ling:: Come on:
Man::
She wins everyturn:
Madam?
The master is back.
Yeah, yeah, the master.
Oh, God, it's my husband!
Hi.
Hello.
What tookyou so long?
I was in the kitchen.
Uhh. Unh.
Stand back.
Here.
Miss me?
Wong::
Whatareyouall doing?
Oh, it's you.
I'm so glad you're home.
How was your trip?
Is everything all right?
Ling::Allright?
Um...oh.
Hmm.
More mah-jongg?
Quiet!
How many times
have I asked you
not to see patients
while I'm away?
You know it's illegal.
Oh, now, I know
I'm not supposed to,
and I tried to wait,
but I had no idea
when you would return.
Besides, ifyou were me,
I knowyou would've done
the same thing.
Wow. I betyou won a lot.
Not now.
Perhaps I should
examine them.
Uh, oh, it's a female problem.
I can handle it.
Fei-Hong, would you prepare
my altar for me?
All right.
You should wash your hands.
Stop it.
We'll need the altar ladder
over here, please.
Did you remember
to water the plants?
- Oh, yes.
- Excellent.
Thankyou.
Fei-Hong::
Hey, Mom, whosemoney?
Wow.
- Son.
- Huh?
What was that?
I didn't hear anything.
Wong:: Thealtar:
Hmm.
Oh, thanks for coming.
My share. Gimme.
Go. Go.
Hey...
show a little respect.
Now, rememberyour treatment
next Friday, ladies.
Bring money.
Ha ha ha.
Hello, Mrs. Wong.
How areyou?
Has MasterWong returned?
Yes. He's inside.
Any news about my ginseng?
Did he get it?
Let's ask him.
Come in.
Oh, thankyou.
Mr. Chan has come
for his ginseng.
Ah, Mr. Chan, I'm--
Why areyou here so soon?
Fei-Hong.
- The ginseng's in the back.
- I know.
- Let me get it.
- Go on.
It's beautiful.
I broughtyou a whole root.
Wait till you see it.
It'sjust in back.
Some tea?
Ah, you are so kind.
Yes. Please have a seat.
I'll be right back.
Thankyou.
I'm getting out ofhere.
Where areyou going?
You got to help me out.
When the master finds out,
he'll kill me.
He will not.
Ling::Fei-Hong:
What areyou doing?
Stepma, come here.
Fei-Hong::
Idon'tknow what to do:
We're in such trouble.
I lost the ginseng
on the train.
What? What did you do now?
What'd she say?
OK, OK, OK. Shh.
Please.
You got to help us out.
Wong::Fei-Hong!
Yes, Dad!
Youjust go out
and serve him tea.
I'll think ofsomething.
I'll leave it up
toyou two. Coming!
Oh, madam, what should
we do about this?
You see that door
behind me?
You mean...
- In the cabinet.
- Sure.
- There's a black box.
- Oh, yeah?
Look inside it.
Ah, another ginseng.
I can't believe it!
Strychnine.
- What for?
- Foryou.
Oh, no, madam, please
don't tease me this way!
Who's teasing?
I haveyour tea, Mr. Chan.
Thankyou very much, son.
Enjoy it.
Go, go.
Father, you must be very hot.
- Let me helpyou.
- Mr. Chan.
Hmm?
Wow.
It's real.
Now, Mr. Chan,
I knowyou have never seen
a specimen as beautiful
as this, haveyou?
Oh, and let me tell you--
wait till you see
what happens toyou
when you take it.
Why, women won't believe
the difference
in your performance,
and you will owe it
all to the master.
What areyou doing
with that rutabaga?
Fei-Hong:
Ohh.
Rutabaga?
This is a rutabaga?
You mean it isn't ginseng?
- No.
- Silly ofme.
Ofcourse it isn't ginseng.
What I meant to tell you
was thatyoushould
stayaway from rutabagas--
especiallybig rutabagas
like this one--
whileyou're takingginseng:
It causes gas and
neutralizes the effect
or something like that.
Excuse me.
Mr. Chan...
I'm glad she remembered
to tell you about that.
You know, most people
don't realize
that when you use ginseng
you should avoid
the use ofrutabaga,
because they're not a good mix.
Rutabaga, shmutabaga.
Stop that, Fei-Hong!
Hi. Back so soon?
Oh, Lord. Now what?
Good luck, now.
You think this
looks like ginseng?
Oh, yeah,
it looksjust like it.
Where did you find it?
Father's bonsai tree.
What a great idea.
Just blame it on Cho.
- OK.
- Aah!
I'll try to keep
your father distracted.
What doyou think ofthis?
Boy, that looks great.
Great. I'm a genius.
Excuse me.
May I have a word?
Just a second.
Ofcourse.
I can wait.
What is it, dear?
- Come.
- What?
Come on.
Just one minute.
Can't this wait?
I'm busy right now.
I'm sorry.
I couldn't wait
anylongerto tellyou:
Fei-Hong is all grown up now.
Someday, he will leave our house.
- What?
- Oh, you know...
how cute he was
when he was little.
Chan::
But whyisit wet?
Let me tell you.
I'm glad you asked.
Because it wasjust
picked this morning.
You're really going
to enjoy the potency
ofthis one.
It's really powerful.
Youjust need
a little bit.
A little brother around here
could take his place.
We can talk
about this later.
Don't be rude.
Please, or I will
never forgiveyou.
You shouldn't talk
that way to me.
Well, you never
let me talk.
Honey, not now.
Mr. Chan--
Don'tyou turn
your back on me.
OK. Fold it up tight
to keep it
nice and fresh
and keep it close
toyour heart--
Like that.
Rememberwhat I told you
and have a nice day.
Right.
Yes. I really do think
we need to talk
about this now.
MasterWong?
Thanks for the ginseng.
Ah. Everything
is all right?
Just fine.
- I'll keep it inside.
- He liked it.
Let me seeyou out.
Let Fei-Hong do it.
I can showyou.
Please, this way.
- Bye-bye, now.
- Good-bye, Mr. Chan.
Anyway, as I was saying
before Mr: Chaninterruptedus,
it's timeyou
thoughtabout this:
I don't know what
you're trying to tell me.
Fei-Hong::
Mother, Mr: Chan'sgone:
Oh, thank God.
What's this all about?
Look, ifyou don't want
to talk about this
right now, I understand.
You've had
a really long trip,
and you should get some rest.
Come on.
Let's sit down.
Yes, Father.
Please take a rest.
It's a good idea.
I better start taking
better care ofmyself.
I need to realize
I'm not getting anyyounger.
Well? Why doyou
make that look?
Because I'm afraid
he'll find the tree.
Don't be silly.
Throw the pot away.
That's not all.
What?
What happens when
Mr. Chan drinks the tea
made from those roots?
Ho ho ho! So he will
get a little dizzy.
Ling::He'sgoing tohave
the time ofhis life:
I wish I could
say the same.
Man::Allright, allright:
That'sitforme:
Seeyou tomorrow.
Hey, thanks for
bringing it down.
Man::Ho Sang,
she's cooling down:
Can you give me
some more fire?
Just give me one minute.
Stand back.
That was great.
Thanks for the light.
Almost quitting time.
After this, I ought to.
That's it!
Seeyou tomorrow.
Hey!
Get them back to work.
But why?
Go!
I'm the new foreman here.
Now ring the bell.
Go on.
Yes, sir.
Hey, Ho Sang,
what the hell you doing now?
Yeah, what areyou,
out ofyour mind?
Sorry.
I wasjust told that
we have a new foreman here.
New foreman?
Well...
we seem to have fallen
behind this month,
so everybodyworks
the night shift
for one month.
What? Extra shifts?
Hey, hold on.
So, let's saywe work
all those overtime
hours foryou...
then we need overtime pay.
Quiet.
You give us no choice.
You eitherwork
the overtime,
orwe close
the steel mill down,
and you'll all be
withoutjobs.
Now, you can take it
or leave it.
Mr. Smith, you can't
blackmail us anymore.
We worked hard foryou,
and now we've had enough!
We quit!
Hold it!
Nobody is to leave.
You'll stay and work.
Doyou understand that?
You can take myjob,
butyou can't run my life!
You thinkyou can make us?
Whoyou thinkyou are?
Let's go!
Don't move!
You're in ourway!
All ofyou, right now!
Get back to work!
Strike breaker!
That's enough!
Aah!
Aah!
Free him!
Ahh! Ohh!
Man: Get him!
Aah!
Everyone up!
Back to work!
Great!
You see?
He's very persuasive.
They're going to get
right back to work.
Ha ha ha!
Men::Huhh!
Instructor::
No, again:
- Ki-yah!
- Huhh!
Ki-yah!
Ki-yah! Ki-yah!
Ki-yah! Ki-yah!
Ki-yah!
Ki-yah!
Ki-yah!
Ki-yah! Ki-yah!
BlackTiger Slash!
Ha! Ki-yah!
Ki-yah!
OK, now! Clean!
It's bloody impossible
to sleep with all this noise.
Why don't wejust buy it
and have it bulldozed?
You know that we've been
through this before.
Mr. Wong refuses to sell.
It's ruining my life,
so why don'tyou go
and do something about it?
Yes, sir.
Man:
I'll catch you later!
Hey, Fun, you're
working too hard.
You need husband to run
that snake stand, huh?
Perfectjob for me, huh?
Tsan::Hahahaha!
A husband, huh?
Yeah. I betyou'd be
running away
from these snakes all day.
Come on, now.
Whywould I want
to pay some lazy man
when I can do it
better, huh?
You know, you make good point.
But seriously now, Fun,
you know, you don't
have man around,
so I worry about
your safety.
Hey, Fun,
I've been thinking--
Let me teach you kung fu.
How about drunken boxing?
Where did you get that idea?
No one does that.
Ifyou reallywant to fight,
I teach you
the Choy Li Fu boxing style.
Oh, wise man speak.
Whatyou looking at?
Get back to work.
We've got customers waiting.
They need the help now.
Woman::
Yellowtail!
Yellowtail? OK.
Drunken boxing.
What does she know anyway?
Hey, Chang Tsan.
Huh?
What, Fei-Hong?
A fillet ofsalmon
and a pound
offish marrow, OK?
Hey, where areyou going?
Fun::
Reallysoftskin,
but themeatis tougher:
Hey, Fun, I'm going
to need a few things, OK?
- Ohh!
- Hi.
Oh, it's getting away.
Oh! Ha ha ha!
One pheasant and
two orders ofhargow:
Ah, that would've
been my choice.
Woman: I've been waiting
for a long time.
- Here.
- Thankyou.
You want this or not?
Tsan::
Igota customer waiting:
Oh, yeah.
I'll be right there.
Oh, Fei-Hong.
Fun::Iheardrunkenboxing
is thebest:
Would you be able
to teach me?
How about it?
Fei-Hong::
Ofcourse: Anytime:
Tsan::Hey!
How about I bone it
foryou, eh?
Oh, no. That's all right.
How about laterwith that?
Fun:: We're discussing
drunkenboxing:
Fei-Hong, when doyou think
you could teach me?
Anytime would be fine.
Youjust let me know.
Tsan::Fun, youneed
realinstructor
to learn how to fight.
Maybe Chang Tsan
can giveyou a lesson.
He doesn't teach
the style I like.
It's for fighting.
Drunken masterjust for show.
Tsan:: Youcannot win
Fiight that way:
Forget him.
He'sjealous.
I likeyour style.
Fei-Hong, time to admit it.
Your drunken boxing is
no match for Choy Li Fu.
Isn't that right?
You agree?
Men: Yeah! Right!
That's right.
Man::
Mastermuchbetter:
Man::Heknows:
Depends on who's fighting.
What doyou say
to a challenge, then?
Out ofmyway.
My Choy Li Fu,
your drunken boxing.
And ifI lose,
you can haveyour fish
and anything elseyou
want no charge, on me.
Listen...
you can learn from Fei-Hong.
I don't need your help.
I appreciate the offer,
but there's
too many people here,
and somebody
could get hurt.
No way, Fei-Hong.
You're going to fight this time.
Attention, everybody!
Listen!
I'm Chang Tsan,
and this is Wong Fei-Hong.
It's your lucky day.
I have challenged him
to a fight.
Come on.
I'll hold this.
Remember, it's an exhibition match,
so go on.
Hah! Hah! Hi! Hyah!
Man:: Oh:
Drunken boxing.
Haah!
Ah!
Fun:: OK, OK,
that's enough:
Allright, that's enough:
The winneris Fei-Hong:
No. Really, it was a draw.
I think Chang Tsan
would agree.
It's not overyet.
Ling::Fei-Hong!
Yeah, I'm coming!
It's my stepma.
- Tsan:: Come on!
- I got to go. Thankyou, Fun.
Seeyou tomorrow.
- Fish.
- Why, thankyou.
What do I oweyou for this?
You can have it.
Thanks a lot.
Fei-Hong::
Thankyou: Excuseme:
Everyone saw
it was a draw, right?
OK, OK, show over.
Don't tell meyou were
fighting for food again.
Me? No way.
You knowyour father
will kill you
ifhe hears about it.
Fei-Hong::
Howcan Ireplace theginseng?
Pawn my diamond necklace,
that's how.
But, why?
We'll be in big trouble
if Mr. Chan decides
to brew that tree root.
You would do that?
Just remember,
you owe me one.
Yeah.
Hey, that's the guy
we're looking for.
Stay close to him while
I go and get the boss, OK?
Yes, sir.
Woman::Stophere:
Ah, OK, here's the money.
I'm sure they're
high quality.
She got them
from her husband.
Look, I'm late already.
Let's go, OK?
So, was the drought
very serious?
In that province,
rice and grain were scarce
before there was a drought.
With no rainfall,
there will be no harvest,
and that is serious.
We must act now.
It's so bad.
They so poor
that some families
have to share
a single pair ofpants.
Wow. Who gets to wear them?
Ifyou havejob,
you wear the pants.
Oh, wow.
Hello. Sorry I'm late.
Man::It'sallright:
Howareyou?
Goodtoseeyou:
Fei-Hong, don'tyou think
we should be going?
Aren'tyou meeting
mywife for tea?
Oh, no, not mah-jongg again.
How can you say that?
It's our fund-raising meeting,
and you were supposed
to remind me.
Oh, I almost forgot.
We'd better be going.
Ah. You don't want
to keep them waiting.
You should go.
Ofcourse.
You're right.
- Bye.
- Good-bye.
Ling: Good day.
No mah-jongg!
Fei-Hong:
Yes, sir.
Man::
Thisguyoverhere:
Go tellJohn.
It's been called
to our attention
that MasterWong needs us
to lend him some money.
Oh, no, no, no.
That's not for me.
I'm sure I speak
for everyone.
We'll just take up
a collection.
Did you hearwhat I said?
I don't personally need
any ofyour money.
It's for
the drought victims.
Butyourwife--
Look, it's nothing
to be ashamed of.
This could happen toyou.
I say if Mr. Wong
needs money...
Nothing right now.
You sure?
You better not
have said anything,
you understand?
I won't tell a soul.
Besides, she's the one
that talks a lot.
Likeyou don't?
How dareyou say that?
I only told my sister--
Qu doesn't even know
I came here.
Whoa, ladies, somebody
has been talking.
They always lie to me.
Look at their faces.
Now, that's enough.
Second Woman:
Can't wejust take a look?
Let's see.
There.
Hey, careful!
Woman::
Oh, sobeautiful:
Oh, don't handle it
like that.
And I'm only
borrowing the money.
You're going to have
to give it back to me.
I know, I know.
I understand.
Come on.
Show it to us.
Here.
So, did you get it?
No. I haven't
actually seen it,
but I'm sure they have it.
Well, we can't waste
any more time.
Grab the seal,
and we'll meetyou out front.
OK, grab it,
and I'll seeyou outside.
Oh, you're so lucky.
You're lucky.
Ah, it's so beautiful on you.
Hey, wait!
The necklace is gone.
You've got to learn
to speak up.
Stop him!
Stop him!
Stop! Come on!
Ling::Let'sgo!
Huh?
Leave it.
Ling::Fei-Hong!
It's over there!
He went that way! Go!
Excuse me!
Excuse me!
You better run.
Fei-Hong, you're my hero!
Oh, you are a hero.
Hey, Fei-Hong.
You see that?
Atta way.
What's this?
You bumped me.
Oh, I'm sorry about that.
No. That's not good enough.
Did I miss something?
Get on your knees
and bow--right now.
What? You must be
out ofyour mind.
Ling::
Leavehim alone:
You were in on it.
I saw the whole thing.
Why don'tyou mind
your own business, bitch?
Hey, whoyou calling bitch?
I can't let him
get awaywith that.
And who the hell
doyou thinkyou are
strutting around here
like a peacock
in that bad English
suit ofyours?
I think I should
kickyour ass.
Oh, yeah?
Wait! Uhh!
Uhh.
Mom, areyou all right?
Go away.
I want this guywasted.
Hey, hey, take it easy.
You'll be OK.
Oh, she wants to fight?
We'll take the two ofyou.
What? You're going
to start this again?
What'd you say?
I said, kick his ass!
You want me to go kick--
You will, or I will.
All right.
Woman:
Oh, what happened?
I'm all right.
He's a very good fighter.
The necklace is inside.
It's going to be ruined!
The necklace?
Fei-Hong!
Over here, Fei-Hong!
Here.
Man:: Where'dhe
learn to do that?
Po Chi Lam.
He does drunken boxing,
doesn't he?
Oh, well, then,
maybe he'll give us
an exhibition
on drunken boxing.
All right.
Whateveryou want.
Fei-Hong! Come here!
All right...
time for drunken boxing.
What about Father?
I'll take care ofhim.
Besides, it will be
great publicity
for the school.
Your dad will be happy.
OK.
Drunken boxing!
All right,
what areyou scared of?
Four ofyou guys
can't beat one?
Get him!
Men: Waah!
What is that, huh?
It's drunken boxing.
Oh.
Come on, now.
What doyou think?
Well, can he do more?
Ofcourse he can.
Yeah.
Hey, you're
a bunch offools.
Come on.
Oh. Let's go.
Wait for us.
Take as much
as you can carry.
OK.
Hey, who's going
to pay for that?
MasterWong's charge account.
All right, then.
Hey, where'd they go?
Over there, I think.
- Let's go.
- Wait for us! Hurry, ladies!
What are they doing?
What's that?
Don't know.
Oh! I'm going
to call the police.
Don't do that.
Fei-Hong, I broughtyou some help.
But Fatherwill kill me.
You can blame it all on me.
You're going to lose
ifyou don't,
sojust go ahead.
Yeah.
Hereyou go--
another bottle.
Both: Aah!
Ling::2atonce?
Doyou think
that's a good idea?
Don't worry.
It gives him power.
Man: Yaah!
Ow!
Ow!
Uhh!
Ohh!
Areyou all right?
What?
One more drink
would be helpful.
Here is the very last bottle.
Yii!
You, get up!
Ow! What the hell was that?
What does it mean
when there's
a picture ofa skull?
Oh. Good stuff.
The last one
really hit the spot.
Whoo!
Monkey Drinks Master's Wine.
That was Crazy Corkscrew
Open Wine Bottle.
White TigerWashes Face.
Turn the Barrel!
What's wrong?
You have a hangover?
Kill him!
Doyou like Drunken Monkey?
Ee-hee!
Ay!
Ah, Eagle Carries Wine Bottle.
Man::
Gotyounow!
Attack! Waterfall!
That one there,
I showed him.
Here is Peter Piper
Playing the Flute.
Mmm! Ooh! Ha ha ha!
Oh, that's a good one.
Down the Hatch!
Wheelbarrow.
Ahh!
Drunken Maid
Flirting With the Master.
- Aah!
- Fei-Hong::Snake Eyes:
Ohh!
And this one?
Uh, GypsyWine.
It's called Gypsywhat?
Just watch.
Aah!
Uncle Stirs the Barrel.
Come back!
Fei-Hong!
He can't even
stand up straight!
Find some more wine.
Ofcourse.
Aah!
MasterWong!
What's going on here?
Those men
are attacking Fei-Hong!
Hold this. Fei-Hong!
Fei-Hong!
Smash Bottle Against the Wall!
Oh, no!
Fei-Hong!
- Ha ha!
- Haveyou been drinking?
You stop it right now!
Down the Hatch!
What areyou doing?
Uh, Father?
Ohh....
Ha ha! You have
the cutest little nose.
Look how well they get along.
How areyou, Dad?
Fighting again!
Fighting? OK.
You should have been here.
Fei-Hong defeated
all 5 ofthose gangsters.
What was this all about?
They tried to steal
the diamond necklace
that Ling sold to me.
What?
You sold your diamond necklace?
Why didn'tyou tell us
Po Chi Lam needed more money?
We would have helped you.
You know we're all friends here.
No. The school
doesn't need money.
Here, you can take charge
ofthe funds we raised.
Stop that! Fei-Hong!
- Hi.
- Hello, Madam Wong.
I said stop it!
No, please, MasterWong,
don't hurt him!
He's drunk!
Mom, fetch me another bottle.
Wong:: Gohomenow!
Now!
Yes, dear.
Do as he says. All right.
Seeyou.
* Go home now, Daddy*
Go on. Follow him!
Losers.
You didn't do any better.
And what wereyou trying to do?
You've ruined
the school's reputation!
They thinkwe're broke!
And you, you idiot,
what have I told you
about drunken boxing and
fighting in the streets?
Now, tell me,
is everything here so bad
you have to sell
your diamonds?
Come on!
Doyou really think
I would have
sold something
that's precious to us?
I would never!
Don't lie to me!
How much money did you
lose playing mah-jongg?
Well, how much?
I always win at mah-jongg.
You don't know what
you're talking about.
Besides, who areyou
going to believe,
me or friends?
Stepma, I believeyou.
Shut up!
Did you hearwhat
I told you? Shut up!
You disobeyed me!
I said absolutely
no fighting and no drinking.
And above all,
no drunken boxing!
You even fought with me,
your own father!
Youdisgraced
your familyname!
Wait! Wait! Hold on!
Would you stop hitting him?
He wasjust defending me!
They tried to break myjaw.
I guess that's something
you don't care about.
Damn you, woman!
It was forbidden!
They could have killed him.
Don'tyou care about that?
Oh, sure.
Like it matters.
You're beating him worse
than those guys ever did.
You're driving me insane!
I can't believe this!
Wong:: What's this?
Cho:: Oh, myGod!
What has happened
to my 300-year-old bonsai?
Damn it!
I forgot to throw it out!
Mr. Cho!
Aah!
What went wrong?
Wong:: Youknowthis garden
isyourresponsibility
andIexpectananswer! Well?
Just hold on!
You shouldn't blame
everything on him that way,
because I was actually
the one who did it.
I was practicing my kung fu
and then I tripped over
that statue right over there.
Luckily, the tree
was there to grab.
God only knows,
I could have gotten killed,
but I see now
you don't care. Oh, well.
You know that's not it, Ling.
I am so sick and tired
ofyour deception!
Ifyou're going
to hit me,just go on.
You know, that's not a bad idea.
Wong::It's time
youshowedmerespect:
That's not gonna work
this time!
You've been hurting me so I
won't cause any more trouble.
You're driving me out ofmy mind!
Aah!
Hit me!
Hit me all right!
Over the head! Kill me!
Kill me and the little one
inside me!
Little one?
Is that so?
We're going
to have a baby?
Wong::
Why didn'tyou tellme?
- Never!
- Come inside.
You told me to get on my knees,
so here I am!
On my knees!
It doesn't matter ifI'm pregnant!
Mom has a little baby!
I apologize.
I wouldn't hityou.
Get away!
You said enough!
Ling, no!
You will hurt the baby!
- Then put me down!
- OK.
Leave me alone, I said!
No! You have to stop this!
All right, I will.
Areyou all right?
There's no way
I'll forgiveyou!
What areyou doing?
This is all my fault.
Please be careful.
Get Madam a chair! Quickly!
Wong::
Whatareyou waiting for?
I'm begging you, Ling.
Sit over there,
you'll be all right.
- Aah!
- Ling!
Oh! Sorry.
Ling, I'm so sorry.
How dareyou?!
Oh, it was an accident, Ling.
Let me helpyou.
You did it on purpose.
Now, ofcourse I didn't.
Don't lie.
Haven'tyou done enough?
Is the baby all right?
Stop it!
Eee. Ooh. Ugh.
It's fine.
Wong::
Good: Areyoucomfortable?
MasterWong,
Mrs. Chan is here.
She has a bit ofa problem.
You stay right here.
I'll be right back.
Congratulations, Father.
I'm really proud ofyou.
Thankyou.
Ah, Mrs. Chan,
it's such a pleasure.
Dr. Wong, uh, this
really isn't ginseng.
I showed it to another doctor
and he says it's poisonous.
Now, I'm not sure
whereyou got it,
butyou've surely
been misled.
It has made my husband
deathly ill.
Mrs: Chan::
Thank Godhe onlybrewedhalfofit:
You owe me,
and you're going to have to
take the blame
for this mess. Now!
Mm-hmm.
Forgive me.
Uncle Ho, get the snake extract.
I can assureyou he will recover
ifyou give him this.
Ah, Dr. Wong,
oh, this is wonderful.
I promise
I won't tell anyone.
It must have been a mistake.
Good day, madam.
Mrs: Chan::
Goodday:
Wong:: Well?
Mmm.
Get over here, Cho!
What's this?
He did it! Fei-Hong!
How could you do such a thing?
Areyou out ofyour mind?
You are destroying
my reputation!
Hereyou go, Father.
You dropped your bonsai tree.
That's it!
I'm gonna kill you!
Ruin me! Drunk!
Wait, Wong, don't! Aah!
Hurt my friends!
That's it!
Just listen!
It was stolen offthe train
and he couldn't get it back!
Oh, shit.
What am I saying?
See, he was trying
to saveyou some tax.
How would he have known
the ginseng would be stolen?
The ginseng was stolen?
Even so,
he still lied to me!
No! Not acceptable!
You shouldn't defend him!
He's a thiefand a drunk.
Just stay out ofit!
I'm thirsty.
Oh, yeah?
You like some wine?
Just stay right there.
I'll giveyou some wine.
Come on, open up.
Come on, drink!
Ling::
Stopit, Wong!Stop!
Nomore!
Whatareyoudoing?
Aaah!
You're going to fight me now?
I disown you!
You are not my son!
Now, get out!
You better do as I say!
Get out!
Come on!
Get out ofhere!
Stop it! That's enough!
Ling::
You'regoing tokillhim!
That's enough, Wong!
Fei-Hong! Fei-Hong!
Ling::
Please, don't!Please!
You're killing him,
Wong, can'tyou see?
I don't care!
I want him out!
Father!
Up! Get out ofhere!
Aah!
That was self-defense!
He didn't mean to do it!
Ling:: Tellyour father
you'resorry!
Out!
Now!
Fei-Hong! Come back!
After him, Cho!
Don't let him go!
Cho!
That way.
Oh, yes.
Man::

Woman::Excuseme, sir:

Woman:

Hello. Beer, please.
Yes, sir.
Very good, sir.
I've never seen you
drink so much.
You knowyour father's
going to be
very angrywith you, Fei-Hong.
Let's not talk about this.
Bring me another drink.
Keep it coming.
Ah, no way.
That's it for tonight.
Ahh.
Excuse me, miss?
I want a song here.
Something I should sing?
The Ocean's Crying,
but I sing it.
You play for me now?
OK.

He's real tough.
A fighter.
Well, let'sjust

**Istillloveyou**
**Nomatter whatyou--**
Party's over.

Fei-Hong::

What? You stop that!
Fei-Hong::
**Loveyou**
You shut up!
Listen to me!
John:: Therestofyou,
go onhome!
Go on!Getoutofhere!
Yeah. You gotta leave.
Go on. Move!
Man:
Let's get out ofthe way.
What happened to the music?
- Oh!
- Aah!
Areyou the drunken boxer?
Sure. I'm pretty drunk,
but I don't know
about boxing.
Man:
He'sjust faking.
Hyah!
John:: Come on:
What's thematter withyou?
GetupandFiightme!
That's Fei-Hong.
Out ofmyway!
What areyou doing?
Hey.
It's none of
your goddamn business.
Aah!
Get him out!
What's going on?
Is this some kind ofjoke?
No! You should
have seen him!
He couldn't be stopped.
Ask anyone.
John::I'llstophim:
Man::
We Finishedhim!
Ha ha! Whyyou kick me?
Look atyou.
Get up and fight me! Come on!
Get this drunk
out ofmy sight!
Go! Go on! Kill him!
No, wait. Notyet.
Don't kill him,
teach him a lesson.
Man::Allright,
you'vehaditnow:
Man::
Careful, he's tricky!
Fei-Hong.
He's hurt bad, yeah.
Girl: Come.
Ooh, that's bad.
Let's go.
Oh, God.
Fei-Hong!
Man: Up there!
Wang!
Woman:: Gethim!
Cuthim down!
Fei-Hong, don't be ashamed.
When we were kids,
we used to go naked all the time.
I should have found you sooner.
You'll be OK.
Just give it some time.
By the way...
I have some good news, too.
Just listen to me.
Guess what.
Everywoman in town
wants to beyourwife.
It's the truth.
Hey, all right. Come on.
Dryyour eyes.
Father...
I know.
I have a good reason
to forbid drunken boxing.
Those who practice it frequently
wind up as alcoholics.
Not ifone uses restraint
and self-discipline.
But that's more difficult
than you might think.
Wong::It's true thatalcohol
canmake thebodyloose
anditspain thresholdhigher,
butit's diffiicult
to drink theproperamount:
Many drunkenboxers
becomenothingmore
than drunken fools:
The odds ofbringing
shameanddisgrace
upon oneselfandone's family
isjust toogreat:
It also reminds me
there is an ancient proverb
that equates the drinking
ofalcohol with water--
'' Boats can foat on water,''
or so it says,
''but they can sink
in it, too.''
Now, that's
a profound lesson.
I have only one question.
What?
Whose boat are
we talking about?
I will never drink again.
Ah, there, there, Fei-Hong.
I'm glad to see
thatyou're OK now.
Come on, let's get up
and thank all your friends here
for helping you. Go on.
Ho Sang::
Fei-Hong, you OK?
Thankyou.
You OK?
You should--
Tsan::Don'tevergive up:
You'llbebetternow:
Everybodymakesmistakes:
How's the baby today?
He'sjust fine.
Let him be.
Oh. All right.
Sorry, we are closed now.
Where's Fei-Hong?
Excuse me?
Is he here?
He might be.
What for?
It's private.
May I come in?
Well, in that case...
Ling::
Iknow whosentyou:
What was that for?
Keepyour distance.
That's enough.
I wantyou to leave.
Hmm.
You know, you're not bad.
Huh? It's you!
You!
Fei-Hong, hold him for me!
Unh!
Help.
Father, help!
- Help him!
- Wong:: That's enough!
Hurting me! Aah!
Fei-Hong, areyou all right?
Yeah, I wasjust pretending.
Fei-Hong, who is that?
Hey!
Fei-Hong, hold it!
We haveyou surrounded!
I'm talking toyou.
Yeah. Would you stop?
Me?
Wong::Please, sir,
Ihopeyoucan forgive us:
I am Wong Kei-Ying.
I apologize.
You are very famous.
Meeting you is an honor.
I am Fu Wen-Chi.
Fu Wen-Chi?
Our most decorated
Manchu officer.
Is it true?
Yes, it is.
It's an honor. Welcome.
- Right this way.
- Thankyou.
Good evening.
I guess that man
is someone important.
Trust me,
ifhe was important,
he wouldn't be hitting
women, would he?
Oh.
Think about it.
What?
Keep searching.
We have to find it.
Look in the parlor
when you're done.
Yes, ma'am.
You have no idea
whereyou left it?
No, I don't.
Where could it be?
Cho might know.
Hey!
Something's wrong?
Oh, it's hot tonight.
I can't stand it.
She's quite a handful.
Oh, think I'll get some ice.
Cho, where's thejade box I had?
What?
Where did you put it?
I don't know.
What is that?
Ground garlic.
I mean there in your hand.
We found it!
Fei-Hong, where areyou going?
- Mom!
- I'm not finished with that.
Fu:: Whenyousurprisedme
in thebaggage car,
I was trying toget
back thejadeseal
thatAmbassadorMorley
hadstolen:
I woundup with
yourginseng instead:
Tell me something,
there must be a hundred
jade seals in our museum.
Is this one so special?
Fei-Hong, they all are special.
Think about this.
Today they plunder a seal.
It seems small.
Tomorrow they take another,
and the next thing you know,
the Great Wall is gone.
And what's next?
Our children must travel abroad
just to see their history.
So, don'tyou see
thatyou and I
are the only possible defense
from governments trying
to strip us ofour culture?
So, I hopeyou can
help me do this,
ifonly for the future
generations ofour people.
All right.
I'll be honored to help.
Thankyou, Fei-Hong.
It's awfully quiet
all ofa sudden.
Where is everyone?
Yeah. There's no one here.
I'll go take a look.
Fei-Hong:: What the:::
Yaah!
- Aah!
- Aah!
Let's go! Let's go! Move!
Fei-Hong:: Uh-oh:
What do we do?
Follow me.
Here I go!
Get him!
Huh?
Man::Allright, liftit!
Fu::Here, Fei-Hong!
Let's go!
- Aah!
- Aah!
Oh, they started.
Oh, I see the fun's begun.
Sounds great.
When you have the Ax Gang,
you're sure to get thejob done.
That's what we're paying for.
Fei-Hong, here!
Hai!
Unh!
- Huh?
- Fu::Fei-Hong!
Oh, my God! No!
Aah!
Hai! Yaah!
Fei-Hong!
Your shirt, take it off!.
OK!
- Quickly, now, go!
- This way!
Go! Go! Move it!
Run! Go on!
What's this?
What's going on?
Don't get involved.
Get on out ofhere.
Now. Go on.
Help.
That's Fu Wen-Chi!
Unh!
Ow! That hurt!
- Man::Hey!
-
Fu Wen-Chi!
- There!
- Master Fu!
Huh? Come on! Let's go!
Master Fu!
- Get behind!
- Help! Help!
- Aah!
- Easy, easy!
Try to stop the bleeding.
Don't die!
Hold on! Master Fu!
We'll go for a doctor!
You'll be all right!
The royal seal...
I know. We'll get it.
Don't worry.
I'll find it.
The embassy. Go quickly.
- What do I do?
- Tonight.
Hold on, Master.
My fatherwill take care ofyou.
I promise. Don't give up!
No, Master Fu! Come on!
What areyou thinking?
Nothing!
May I giveyou a light?
Hold this, please.
Thanks very much.
Thereyou are.
Carry on.
Pick it up.
What's wrong with you?
- Chang Tsan?
- Fei-Hong?
Come on!
You almost killed me!
What areyou doing here?
Me? What areyou doing here?
Come on.
I got him.
So, where's the seal?
How should I know?
Let's go.
Here.
Thanks.
Fei-Hong::
Anybodyseeyou?
Tsan::No: Ican'tsee:
Yougotalight?
Ofcourse: Holdit:
Down.
Ambassador::
Looking forsomething?
Is this what broughtyou here?
Guard::Kneel!
Ambassador::
Ihopeyoudon'tmind:
We've taken the liberty
to documentyour stay
at our magnificent embassy.
Please do enjoy
our hospitality.
You can go straight to hell!
Man:: That's enough!Over!
A winner.
That'll be all, gentlemen.
We'll continue the plan
as scheduled.
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.
Thankyou.
Things have worked out
ratherwell
now that we have
thejade seal back
and a way to acquire
Po Chi Lam.
That's right.
I've already sent
the embassy photographs
of Fei-Hong and his friend
to MasterWong.
He'll sell just like I told you.
He has no choice.
Make sure
he understands,John,
that we expect him to vacate
the Po Chi Lam immediately,
orwe'll plan
to execute Fei-Hong.
Oh!
Damn those boys!
Don't they understand
there's nothing we can do?
As an embassy, they're exempt
from the laws ofChina.
Maybe we can reason
with them. I'll go.
Sit down!
You know what theywant--
the rights to Po Chi Lam!
Theyjust wanted
to return the seal.
They aren't the criminals.
- You spoiled him!
- You disowned him!
- This is all your fault!
- This is all your fault!
You're impossible.
And you're his father.
We're running out oftime.
We've got to do something.
You're right.
I refuse.
How can I?
You know this land has been
in our family for centuries.
There has always been
a school here.
What would you do,
just give it up?
I'll never do it.
Oh, really?
What would his mother have done?
I bet I know!
Sister, I need yourwisdom
more than ever.
What can we do for Fei-Hong?
Can you help us?
Release them.
You may let them go.
You OK?
Just go on.
Tsan.
I'm grateful.
Areyou hurt? OK.
Stepmom.
Just look atyou.
I'm gonna be all right.
Madam Wong.
Areyou OK, Master?
Some bruises, but I'll be fine.
So, what will we do now?
What doyou mean?
MasterWong has sold
the school to the embassy.
He did what?!
How could that be?
Don'tyou see?
They made him sell it.
He had to or they
would kill you both.
You'rejust lucky
to be alive.
Fei-Hong, this fight is over.
We can't do this anymore.
I hopeyou knowyour father
has sacrificed everything.
I wish that
they had killed me.
Now, Fei-Hong,
that is enough.
Life's changes are
like a moving river.
What's here today
is gone tomorrow
and tomorrow brings
a whole newjourney.
Let's move forward and live.
So, when will the ship be leaving?
This Tuesday.
Hmm. And everything's ready?
Man:: Yes, sir:
Readyandwaiting, sir:
Good, good.
I want to close down the factory,
lay offthe workers,
and transport the shipment
to Hong Kong.
Pick it up.
Men: Yes, sir.
First we work overtime!
We refuse, then they beat us!
Chin::Andnowthey think
they can Fireallofus
just like that!
So, areyou guys going
to let him get awaywith that?
What doyou say, huh?
Chang Tsan, what's going on?
They closed the mill,
and you know what?
It was English ambassador
who was in charge
ofdoing it.
Sounds like trouble.
I don't think I can helpyou.
Oh, sure.
You didn't loseyourjob.
Well, I'm not gonna
let them push us around.
Yeah. As soon as they
finished the last shipment,
they fired all the men.
And you think they have
something to do with it?
I don't know, but I'm going
to find out for sure.
Let me think
what it could be.
We should check the office.
Fei-Hong, could that be it?
Well, we know
they're up to something.
- Find a way into the factory.
- OK.
Then we'll find
a way to stop them.
Let's go.
Chin::
What--What's this?
My God!
Lookwhat they're doing!
Well, we've got
to stop them.
I'll tell Fei-Hong.
Hurry, Ho Sang!
In a hurry?
Sorry.
Aah!
Let go!
Aah!
Unh!
Chin:: Gogethelp!
Ho Sang, this way!
No. I've got
to tell Fei-Hong.
Get out ofhere!
Get them!
Bring Fei-Hong!
Go now!
Yaah!
Yaah!
Shit!
Madam, they're coming out.
All right, keep it down.
Then we can organize.
A good idea. Good day.
Good-bye.
Have a safe trip.
Take care ofthe baby.
I will.
Fei-Hong?
Yes, Father?
Don't get up.
Keep working.
Areyou almost
through with that?
Almost finished.
Then start another one.
I'll make sure he does.
It's my responsibility.
He's not allowed to leave.
You understand me?
Perfectly.
All right. Good.
You know, dear,
I'vebeen thinkingabout
names forthebaby:
Ifwe were to have a boy,
he could be Wong Tei-Pau.
Ifit's a girl, Wong Pei.
Nice. Both names are fine.
But do we really
need to pick one now?
What ifI'm early?
That shouldn't be a problem
ifyou take it easy
till I get back.
Ofcourse.
- Yes?
- Fei-Hong?
Water the plants.
I will!
Hold on! I've got to go.
Remember, get lots ofrest.
We'll be fine.
Don't worry.
Fei-Hong and I
will bejust fine.
Go! We don't have
any time to spare!
Hurry!
We've got to get Chin
out ofthere.
I hope he's still alive.
What can we do?
I'm going to stop them.
I'm going to do what I can!
I gave my promise
to Fu and Chin!
What doyou think?
Let's go.
Hey, wait,
where areyou going?
I'm going to battle!
But--
Wait, madam, you can't go
in your condition.
What condition?
Come on, I'm only pregnant.
Oh, madam, please.
Think about the baby.
What ifsomething
were to happen?
You're right.
Go ahead without me, then.
I'll go get my students.
Meet me at the mill.
Right.
I'll gather up the men.
Oh, thanks, Fei-Hong.
You're with us, right?
Yeah, OK.
Will you be all right, madam?
- Good.
- I'll be fine.
But what if
Father finds out?
Oh, go on.
Who cares now whatyour father thinks?
Only make me proud.
I will. OK.
- Yeah?
- Oh! Fei-Hong!
Something for good luck.
I can use it.
Men: We demandjustice!
We demandjustice!

Guards:

You step aside now!
We demandjustice!
We know whatyou have in there!

Hmm.
On behalfofthe governor,
I want to thank Fei-Hong
for his role in returning
the stolen antiquities
and on the arrest
ofthe ambassador.
Thankyou, sir.
None ofthis could
have happened
without the support
ofhis loving father.
Ah, well, we need more fathers
who treat their sons like that.
You should be
very proud ofhim.
So, where is he?
Fei-Hong is still feeling
some ofthe aftereffects
ofall that
he's been through.
We hope he'll soon be
on his feet.
I'm sure that he will come
seeyou as soon as he can.
Oh, and he better.
I've got ajob for that boy.
I am certain he will be
most pleased.
