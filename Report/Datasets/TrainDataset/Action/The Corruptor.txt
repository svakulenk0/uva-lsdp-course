Fukienese Dragons not funny now, huh?
MAN : The Fukienese Dragons...
the newest entity
on the Chinatown crime scene...
are headed by 20-year-old Bobby Vu
from the Fukien province of China.
Sources say the bombing
and the execution of a Tong soldier...
are the latest chapter
in a power struggle...
between the Fukienese Dragons
youth gang...
and the Tong-run
Tong Fung Benevolent Association...
believed to be headed
by businessman Benjamin Wong...
known in the neighborhood
as Uncle Benny...
along with his lieutenant, Henry Lee.
Whoa.
CHEN :
-  Fuck you.
-  Hey.
Learned some English. Good for you.
PHAN:
What the fuck?
English?
Good. What do they call you?
Jack.
I can't hear you.
- Jack.
- Jack.
Tell Bobby Vu his time is running out
in Chinatown.
MAN: In the history of the 15th Precinct,
few officers have done more...
to serve and protect the public
of this great city...
than Lieutenant Nicholas Chen.
Lieutenant, for bravery in the line
of fire and for bringing to justice...
those responsible
for the Chinatown bombings...
the people of New York thank you...
and present you with this commendation.
Whew.
CHEN :
VU: Let your brothers die, huh?
Let your brothers die, huh? Huh?
- Sorry.
- Are you Fukienese Dragon?
- JACK: Yeah. I'm Fukienese Dragon.
- Huh? Huh?
Avenge your brothers, okay?
Kill that cop.
POLICEMAN:
No, no, no, you better tell him.
Everybody works tonight.
We are visiting Ginzu Massage.
UNG: My kind of raid.
Found another young pretty
in a dumpster.
CHEN: Hmm.
Anybody I know?
Did a two-hour sweep.
No one would speak to me.
- UNG: Try breath mints.
- DENG: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
And the two who found the body say
they didn't see, hear or smell anything.
- What's new?
- Hi.
I'm Daniel Wallace.
I was assigned to this unit.
The Chinese don't trust whites or cops.
And you're giving me a white cop?
Hey, you've been squawking
about more manpower?
They want more ethnic diversity
in each squad. Bing.
You get a white face in AGU.
He's worse than white. He's green.
- Ha, ha.
- Good. You school him, then.
So he can get me killed?
It's your fault he's here
in the first place.
My fault?
A freaking tourist gets blown up
in our backyard...
- ...and it was on your watch.
- Oh, yeah.
Mayor's on television talking about it.
Police commissioner's promising
safe streets in Chinatown.
Christ, it was even on Nightline.
So if putting a white cop
in the Asian Gang Unit...
makes them happy
and gets them off my back...
fine and dandy.
Get out of here. Do something about
those whores turning up in dumpsters.
It's an embarrassment.
You still here?
CHEN: Why does a white cop
request the Asian gang unit?
Detective's shield,
extra 8 grand a year in my pocket...
the chance to work with you.
UNG: Uh-oh. Yellow fever.
You got a hard-on
for all things Chinese, right?
Food, customs, women?
I bet you got a Chinese girlfriend,
don't you?
- Actually, no, I don't.
- But you did.
Heh. Are we all gonna exchange
our sexual histories here?
Heh, heh. I knew it. Yellow fucking fever.
Junior's here to walk the street...
and get his wick licked
by a nice almond-eyed beauty.
I'm here so Chinese immigrants
don't have to live 30 to a room...
work 20 hours a day
making close to slave wages.
Why do you give a shit
about the Chinese immigrants?
I'm a cop. I give a shit
about enforcing the law. That's my job.
So, what's your plan
to save the yellow people?
Same techniques used in every
organized crime operation in the city.
Bust street soldiers every time
we see them.
Work our way up the food chain to the
council, cramp them with surveillance...
and keep climbing all the way
to Benjamin Wong.
This ain't every other
organized crime operation.
We work cases, junior.
Keep the tourists safe.
Violence spills in the street,
we break heads.
You don't change Chinatown, boy.
It changes you.
Well, I'm ready to give it a shot.
That's why I'm here, sir.
All right.
Don't make plans tonight.
Well, why not?
Because we're going
on a panty raid. Oh!
You never know how a guy getting
his dick rubbed is gonna react.
Keep your eyes sharp
and your Glock cocked.
And don't feel any Chinese titties,
you little pervert.
Hey, boy, stay out there.
CHEN: Police!
- POLICEMAN 1: All right.
- We've got 18.
- The place is secured.
- Hold on a second.
Deng, see if you can find
any files back there.
John, take them down.
Wallace will help you. Come on.
JOHN: Come on, ladies.
POLICEMAN 2: Hey.
DANNY:
Hey, want me to take her for you?
CHEN : Always throw back
the smallest fish of the day.
Let's go.
- Hey.
- WOMEN: Aah!
CHEN: Go!
Fire your weapon!
They're Fukienese!
I'm out on three!
One, two, three!
CHEN: Stop!
Drop your weapon! Drop it!
Hands to the wall.
- You stupid Fukienese!
- Aah! Unh.
You're late.
- Ung.
- POLICEMAN: Let me get this.
CHEN: Get me the car.
CHEN: Bobby Vu.
MAN: Hey.
You want some? Want some?
Fukienese Dragon.
Beef intestine noodles. Want some?
No.
Wanna be a Chinese,
you gotta eat the nasty stuff.
You saved my life last night.
Part of my job.
Hey, man, I still wanna say thanks.
That said, I heard you paid a visit
to Bobby Vu.
Look, I tightened up, but I didn't find my
badge in a Cracker Jack box. I earned it.
You study Chinese, so you know
what it means that I saved your life.
It means my life is yours to do with
as you wish.
Mm. That's right.
So here's my advice:
quit before you end up dead.
If you don't wanna work with me, fine.
Let me do my own investigation.
Just don't keep me from doing my work.
I'm a cop.
You, a cop? Heh.
You're playing cop.
Playing?
Playing's driving past shit
pretending you didn't even see it.
That's what playing is.
You got something to say? Say it.
Why don't I show you?
MAN: Cops! Get out of here!
DANNY: Police, freeze!
Freeze!
What do we have here?
Hands behind your back.
You're under arrest.
FBI. I want each one of these guys
in different rooms, now.
Each guy in different rooms, right now!
- POLICEMAN: Let's go.
- Can I talk to you, please?
What's up, Pete?
Oh. Nothing. Only that you assholes
just arrested a federal agent...
working undercover with the Tongs.
Nice work, junior.
I made the arrest.
Well, goody for you.
So tell me, Einstein,
what am I supposed to do now?
Hmm?
What do I do?
Put a federal agent in jail
to maintain his cover? What do I do?
What do I do? Let him go?
We put him back on the street, everyone
will think he cut a deal with you...
and he'll be dead inside an hour.
- So, what should I do?
- Do a better job of keeping us informed.
- Hear, hear.
- SCHABACKER: Heh. Oh, right.
Confidential undercover assignment.
Key word being "confidential"...
which nothing in this
CHEN: Relax, Pete.
We lost the drugs, no evidence.
They can all go.
All right, all right. Keep them three hours,
slap the shit out of them, let them go.
I want everything on the raid by the end
of the day. Keep that dipshit on a leash.
You take care of your people,
I'll take care of mine.
Which one's FBI?
Uh, the Chinese one.
UNG: You wanna eat this with soy sauce?
UNG: Hey, cough up the cash, junior.
Knuckleheads buy all rounds.
Blow me.
That's it.
Show a little piss and vinegar.
So your first bust
was a federal agent...
and a senior fed
bit off a giant piece of your ass.
So why did the FBI want the info
on the Ginzu raid?
It was their raid.
They use us
so nobody knows it's the FBI.
Mostly, they use us
because they are lazy shits.
Last summer,
we grabbed a Vietnamese gang...
bringing in heroin by the boatload.
Who swoops in last minute
to get the credit?
Your friend Schabacker of the FBI.
Now they have agent working
undercover inside the Tongs.
We find the agent,
see what he's got going.
When the time is right,
we make the bust...
and pull the case
right out from under them.
UNG: You speak Chinese?
Doesn't everybody in Chinatown?
Danny Wallace, Henry Lee.
You gentlemen are partners?
Are we?
Cagney and Lacey.
Chinatown needs more police.
I hope you find a home here.
I think you'll discover that Chinese
people are warm and generous.
I hope to see much of you
in the coming weeks.
Enjoy.
He's Tong.
That's why it's Cristal
and not Asti-fucking-Spumanti.
Ah. Henry.
It is very dangerous
to approach a white policeman.
We cannot risk exposing our other ties
in the department.
That's why, uncle,
we must approach Wallace.
He could compromise Chen...
at a time when he's our best weapon
against the Fukes.
We need him with us
to safeguard Chen's position.
Besides, to the N.Y.P.D.,
Chen is Chinese first and a cop second.
Chen can take care of himself.
He knows what we need of him.
LEE:
He knows what he hears in the 15th.
A white officer would have ears
outside the precinct.
We could let Chen test the waters.
- What do you want?
- I liked your partner.
I think he could help us.
He could hurt us more.
Afraid of competition?
Afraid of piquing the kid's interest...
In who else is a dirty cop.
Uncle Benny feels he might poke his
nose in places a Chinese cop wouldn't.
I can handle him.
He also feels he might be an asset
against the Fukes...
heh, since you don't seem
to be doing much, eh? Heh, heh.
I will take care of the Fukes.
The kid's a short-time.
Leave him alone.
I didn't realize
you had such maternal instincts.
Uncle Benny wants you
to speak with him.
No.
This costs $1 to make...
and some fool will pay hundreds for it.
It's amazing how easy it is
for some people to overestimate worth.
Don't overestimate yours.
Talk to him.
- Who's in the bin?
- DENG: The invisible woman.
No ID, no prints, no nothing.
- Thought you liked Chinese food, junior.
- CHEN: Shut up.
- Let's go. I need about 50 coffees.
- What, we're not gonna investigate this?
- We just did.
- What? What are you talking about?
Tell our partner what we learned.
Deceased is an illegal,
straight off the boat. Less than a week.
There's two bills Chinese
under the oysters, by her spleen.
She finds her passage over
was twice what she thought.
She can't pay and doesn't like working
as a prostitute, so she ends up here.
No family, no friends, no witnesses.
UNG: No sense wasting taxpayers' money.
What, so case closed?
Take a walk with Deng.
See if anybody knows anything.
Sure.
Let's go.
- POLICEMAN 1: Careful.
- POLICEMAN 2: Go ahead. Go ahead.
- JACK: What the fuck, man?
- UNG: Easy, Jackarroo.
Chen is now able to identify the shooter
who got away from the lamp store.
Unless you can do something for me.
I want Bobby Vu.
He'd kill me.
UNG: The alternative to helping us
is 10 to 20 at Sing Sing.
And that's gotta hurt...
especially for somebody 98 pounds
soaking wet.
- No court, no wire?
- No promises.
Think about it.
You got 10 seconds
to make up your mind.
- Five, four, three...
- JACK: Fuck you.
- ...two...
- JACK: Unh.
Kid's loyal.
See how loyal he is
after two weeks in lockup.
- Could've killed you.
- Could've killed you first.
- What are you doing here?
- Father can't visit his son?
Got something to drink?
I'm as dry as a 90-year-old tit.
How'd you get in?
Twenty years Robbery and Homicide.
Out of the two-five, greenhorn.
That's how I got in.
- I've been through more windows...
- I don't have any money.
I'm in for 12 grand.
Those fucking dagos down on Mulberry.
- Good luck.
- I'm not asking for the 12.
God forbid you should bail me out
with your lawyer money.
I wouldn't want you to miss out
on becoming a leech, asshole.
And here I thought you'd want me
to be a chip off the old block.
All I'm asking for is a little
stake money to get me even.
Wouldn't work. Too much of a loser.
Then we'll go partners.
You was always
a lucky son of a bitch, eh? Eh? Eh?
I wouldn't be here
if this wasn't serious.
Cold, hard cash. You slay me.
There's a little over 500 there,
and we're not partners.
That's to buy you off.
Next time you sneak up on me...
Yeah, yeah, I know, I know.
You'll kill me, huh?
By the way...
there's a Chink watching you
from across the street, Sherlock.
Good night, officer.
Yeah, you're welcome.
I got something for you.
I love gifts.
This isn't free. Forget the kid.
That's an expensive request.
CHEN: This is an expensive item.
LEE: Let's hear it.
The FBI have an informant
inside the Tong.
This time, it's one of their own.
It's an agent.
- Who is it?
- Don't know.
We picked up four of your guys,
and one was a fed.
It won't take long
to find out which one.
And all you gotta do
is blow his cover...
and they'll pull him.
No violence, no mess.
My thanks.
The kid is out.
As you wish.
Would you like May to give you a grape?
LEE: We need to delay
the start of our new partnership.
We've got a federal agent
sniffing around.
I have to postpone delivery.
VU: We can't.
The boat's coming into port next week.
It'll wait at the port.
I'm not afraid of the FBI.
Everything we've done has been
to keep the feds' focus on Uncle Benny.
When he's gone and I lead the Tongs,
you'll make all the money you want.
Let's kill him now.
When Uncle Benny's indicted, he'll be
a danger to our partners in Hong Kong.
Killing him then will come with thanks
instead of retribution.
We kill Chen too.
All in good time.
Do you remember me?
Yeah.
Heh. I have information about the girl
you found in the garbage dumpster.
- How'd you find me?
- You're conspicuous in Chinatown.
Two brothers on Chrystie Street
bring in illegals.
That girl worked in their brothel,
then tried to run.
They left her as a message
to the others.
- How do you know?
- Everyone knows.
No one is going to speak of it,
especially to police.
So why are you?
I knew her.
- What are their names?
- You can't tell anyone, not even Chen.
- Forget it. I can't do that.
- For every person who knows...
the chances of me
being killed in reprisal...
increases a hundredfold.
The girl was 15.
And there are more to come
if you don't help us.
Check out the basement of a place
called Tony's.
Don't worry. This is how things
get done in Chinatown.
The boy come in yet?
Not that I've seen.
DANNY: Police, freeze!
Freeze!
I said, freeze!
What were you doing in here?
I was coming out of the diner on Pell
and I saw this guy snatch a purse...
so I chased him into the building.
I lost him as soon as I got inside.
Then I heard some screaming from down
here and I just kind of stumbled onto it.
We got close to 40 women here,
all illegals...
and we found about a hundred tapes.
Landlord remembers the four Jane Does
we pulled out of the dumpsters...
were part of the stable.
- Good job, officer.
- Thanks.
- POLICEMAN 1: Attaboy, Wallace.
- Yeah, way to go.
- POLICEMAN 2: Wallace.
- POLICEMAN 3: Good job.
MAN: For bravery in the line of fire,
the people of New York...
thank you and present you
with this commendation.
- POLICEMAN: Way to go.
- POLICEWOMAN: Hey.
It's dick size.
- You think everything is dick size, huh?
- It is.
White people believe
all Asians got little dicks.
So you think that when an Asian chick
sees your pecker...
she's gonna think
it's Mount St. Helens.
It's true.
And then you look at the tiny hands
on most Asian chicks...
and figure your weenie's gonna look
like a sewer pipe in her fist.
Ha-ha-ha. He's discovered my secret.
Well, the joke's on you...
because this Chinaman's hung
like a fucking...
Gnat. Ha-ha-ha.
You wanna see? You wanna see?
- Hey, hey, come on, put that thing away.
- CHEN: No, no. Sit down.
That's my cue.
I'm gonna see you guys tomorrow.
Eight sharp. We gotta put a tag
on those guys you busted...
find out which one is the FBI agent.
And I remember you and me used to spend
The whole goddamned day in bed
Losing a whole year
Hey, Wallace.
You did a lot for those women
down there. You did a good job.
- Thanks.
- But it was an accident.
You are lucky you are not dead.
So don't you ever go off alone again.
Congratulations, Danny.
- Thanks. Look, I gotta...
- You must allow me to buy you a drink.
- I gotta go.
- You've done a great thing...
for the people of this community.
Let me thank you, as a show of respect.
Please.
- DANNY: Shit.
- SEAN: I tried to, but I never made it.
- Pop, we gotta get you to a hospital.
- No time.
- Shit, you're bleeding inside, Pop.
- Oh, well, wouldn't be surprised.
I need the money.
- I don't have that kind of money, Pop.
- How much you got?
I don't know. A grand at most.
Shit.
Shit. Come on, again.
- Come on, this way.
- No. Hey, hey.
Would you give it to me if you had it?
Hmm? Hmm?
No, I don't think I could, Pop.
Fucking honest, just like your mother.
Oh, screw it, then.
Might as well go to the hospital.
Come on.
We'll get you there.
Come on. Get up.
What's going on?
Figure out which one's the FBI agent?
- If he's there, we haven't seen him.
- You better get in there.
He's fucking pissed at you.
What's new?
- CHEN: You are late.
- DANNY: Sorry about that.
My old man fell last night.
I had to take him to the hospital.
- Took all night to get him there?
- Well, he fell last night...
but I didn't find him till this morning.
He was in the bathroom.
- Looks like he scratched you.
- Yeah, well, I was carrying him.
- He all right?
- Yeah. He should be fine.
He was a cop, right?
Uh, yeah, in the two-five.
Tough beat.
Is that why you're here?
Prove something to your old man?
No, why, is that why you're here?
CHEN: My old man's dead.
I don't have to prove anything
to anybody.
- How about you?
- Just to you, I guess.
That's for sure.
Why do you have to constantly
break my balls?
I'm educating you well this time.
Do you mean you care about me?
I don't know what to say.
Try nothing.
Oh, but I'm overwhelmed.
I mean, I had no idea
that you felt this way about me, it's...
I mean, it's just very kind
and warm and... Heh.
Hey, check this out.
These guys don't look like junkies.
- You got pictures?
- Not all of them.
- Shit!
- Shit.
CHEN: Police!
Meet me with the car!
Come on, boy!
This is Car 7 in the green sector.
We're in pursuit of a burgundy Cadillac.
Jersey plates.
Five-nine-five-Alpha-Alpha-Zulu...
traveling south on Park Row.
Suspects are armed and dangerous.
Requesting roadblock units
on all lanes.
WOMAN :
All green units, 10-85.
All green units, 10-85.
Burgundy Cadillac traveling south
on Park Row.
Suspects armed and dangerous.
WOMAN 2: Hey!
Nick, right there!
Chen, watch out!
CHEN: Hold on!
Ugh. Damn it.
- DANNY: You okay?
- Yeah. Yeah! Aah!
Go! I said, go!
- You all right?
- You?
SCHABACKER: Six innocent bystanders...
dozens of cars...
millions in property, all destroyed.
Not to mention...
Federal Agent Ronald Ming is dead.
Shot seven times in the back.
And I'm thinking some scumbag
in the 15th is responsible.
Maybe some scumbag in the bureau
is responsible.
Maybe I'm gonna grow
a tree out of my dick.
- If anybody could...
- You bet your ass, it'd be an oak.
They ID'd the shooters.
They're Fukienese.
Fukes have been making a move
on Tongs for months.
That's the only thing keeping me...
from ripping this
fucking precinct to the ground.
That and this.
Assholes were
in such a hurry to get moving...
they didn't check the bodies for wires.
Who's on it?
Benny Wong.
A few others.
Three weeks' worth of undercover work.
A court would never admit it
without the agent backing it up.
Yeah, they will...
once you tell them you've been
working with us on this investigation.
That after the shooting and before
the chase, you entered the building.
You approached our agent,
who with his last breath...
told you that he got this tape
and corroborated what's on it.
That's perjury.
Why would I do that?
Why?
Well, to keep me
from bringing charges against you...
for obstructing
a federal investigation.
Oh, yeah. Wallace told us...
how you engaged in the unauthorized
surveillance of a federal agent...
which possibly blew his cover,
resulting in his assassination.
That speech
may have shivered a rookie...
but you need better for me.
Yeah? I'll tell you what.
You better watch your back.
My guts still tell me somebody
in the 15th gave my guy up.
If I can't have Uncle Benny,
I'm gonna fucking have him.
Mr. Chen.
Come on. Let's go.
DANNY: Yeah?
Hey.
- You alone?
- Yeah.
Then ask me in.
You wanna come in?
Hmm... Tsk.
What's going on?
- You got something to drink?
- No.
Well, I haven't gone shopping yet.
About yesterday,
you saved my life out there.
It's part of the job.
Maybe...
but I still want to say thank you.
You know what it means
now that I saved your life, right?
This is America.
It doesn't mean anything.
So feds getting you nervous?
No, not at all.
Good.
Because whether it's the feds,
Internal Affairs, whoever...
the inside of a cop car is sacred.
You don't tell them what we do
unless you come to me first.
Why the sudden paranoia?
I'm just saying,
no more talking with the feds...
until we are working off the same page.
Yeah, sure.
Good.
Do you even have water?
Regular water, yeah.
Please.
Thank you.
Nice-looking girl.
Do you know she's in the country
illegally?
Gonna have to send her back...
after a little jail time, of course.
Shame you two
will never see each other again.
You can't send her.
She's in trouble there.
She'll be sent to prison.
CHEN: Too bad.
I can't help you.
That's what you told me, isn't it?
I help you when they move me.
She comes too, with papers.
My pager number.
Punch one one after your number
so I know it's you.
I get you out...
you better not run on me.
I want whoever shot that undercover fed
on this tape.
And I want to know
if he talks to Henry Lee.
WOMAN :
Dr. Bergen to ICU west.
Dr. Bergen to ICU west.
SEAN: Hey.
Thank you.
For the money. They sent a guy.
You must've really put something
on the line.
I'm not gonna forget that.
- LEE: Hello, officer.
- Did you cover my father?
- Tea?
- I asked you a question.
I want to help you
because I want you to help me.
What do you mean, help you?
Heh. My business is victimless.
I supply services people want
and are forbidden to them by politicians.
However, there are those
whose business is not victimless...
whose tactic is violence.
I can help you rid Chinatown
of those elements...
and help keep your father alive.
All I ask is that you look out
for my interests in return.
I think you're asking
for more than that.
Long after you and I are gone...
there will be gambling in Chinatown.
There will be men
waiting to pay a woman for her favors.
And the police will always be
the last to know. That's a fact.
Now, you can chase your tail in the dark
and accomplish nothing...
or you can really do some good...
for the people of Chinatown...
for your career...
and for your father.
Think of how many more young women
would have ended up in dumpsters...
if not for your acceptance of my help.
Do we have a deal?
Or do you want me to call the Italians
and rescind my offer...
and let them deal with your father?
Good.
There's something I'd like you to do
tomorrow morning.
There's a tin shop on Mott.
A Malaysian runs it.
Tomorrow morning at 6 a.m...
he'll be receiving two bricks
of heroin from a Colombian.
These men are scum.
They deal to children.
I want you to stop them.
Freeze! Police!
You son of a bitch.
When did Lee approach you?
The bust from Chrystie, right?
- Yeah.
- I knew your story was full of shit.
When did he approach you?
I bet it was quite a while before that.
When was it, two years ago,
five years ago?
How long have you been working
for him, or can you even remember?
You're dead.
Your life is over.
I thought you were smart,
but you're not.
You're as dumb as they come.
DANNY:
You gave him that FBI agent, didn't you?
That's why you pressed that kid
so hard to wear the wire, huh?
You wanna know if the Fukes
killed that agent or Henry Lee.
- We had a deal.
- You brought him in, not me.
I couldn't risk it.
- Let him go.
- LEE: What's done is done.
You know that better than anyone.
You want to help him? Smarten him up.
Make sure he doesn't trip on his toes
and fuck both of you.
I hear dirty cops have an extra
rough time of it in prison.
I find out you killed the fed,
I'll kill you.
Black or red plum?
I don't like plums.
What do you mean, you don't like plums?
- I like peaches.
- Peaches are shit.
Haven't you ever heard the song
Sinatra sang?
"Out of the tree of life,
I just picked me a plum."
- Not a peach, a plum.
- I don't care if he picked a raisin...
out of Sammy Davis' eye socket,
I prefer peaches.
Then I'm not paying for it.
So when did Lee get to you?
I was the first Chinese cop in the 15th.
Thought I was gonna clean up Chinatown.
But white cops wouldn't work with me.
And the people wouldn't talk to a cop,
Chinese or not.
Only Benny Wong would talk to me.
He took me around,
took care of my debts...
fed me a few busts.
Made me look good, and I liked it.
Then he became my godfather.
At that time, Henry Lee was nothing.
One night, my father walks into
a gambling house and ends up dead.
Turns out,
Lee knew there was a contract on him.
He made it clear.
He could have told me.
I could have saved him.
Got me thinking I was better
at my job with him...
than without him.
And he was right.
SCHABACKER:
Give me everything you got on this guy.
Detective in the 15th Precinct.
His name is Daniel Wallace.
His old man went crooked
out of the two-five. Check on him too.
Mr. Wong...
we're running a one-day sale.
Chance of a lifetime.
The opportunity to buy your freedom.
Now, this tape was obtained...
by a federal agent working undercover
inside the Tong.
I'll put a pistol in your mouth and pull
- Hello?
- Patience has paid off.
Uncle Benny made a visit to the FBI.
His time is over.
Good.
- VU: We got a job.
- What is it?
We take care of Benny Wong tonight.
Heh. Come on, let's go.
CHEN: My friends are waiting for me.
How long do you think
the feds are gonna be watching us?
Month. Maybe two.
I didn't want Lee involving you.
It's not your fault.
What I'm saying
is that you're alone now.
You can't trust anybody
in the department.
Not the guys in the 15th.
Not the guys in the AGU.
And you sure can't trust Henry Lee.
So if anything gets sticky,
you come to me.
How do I know I can trust you?
You don't.
Hey. Hey. I know this might sound crazy,
but I'm glad it's not just me.
You hungry? I could buy you a plum.
- I got plans.
- Maybe next time.
Yeah. Next time.
Thanks.
CHEN:
May?
I gotta take a leak, man.
MAN:
He said he wanted me at the other ward.
She's lucky you found her.
I want you to write her up
as a deceased.
- Nick.
- She recovers, she go to work.
Two weeks later,
she back in here, maybe not so lucky.
You're asking a lot.
Let her stay here a few days.
Then I come to get her.
What the fuck are you doing?
I'm sick.
I wasn't sure
if I had to go back inside or not.
I'm all right, man, let's go.
What the fuck's going on here?
Let's get out of here.
Uh, hello, is this Domino's Pizza?
Jack thought
he was gonna shit his pants.
Uncle Benny.
You kill me?
You're not man enough, huh?
- We kill you anyway!
- Heh, heh.
Uncle Benny!
Wallace!
Wallace!
Where are you going?
Lee's not covering my old man
with the Italians. I gotta move him.
- I told him to stop.
- Why the hell did you do that?
Because the feds are building a case
against you.
- How do you know?
- Lee told me.
If they nabbed you, it would take
three seconds for you to give them me.
- I would never do that.
- I'm not saying it's fatal.
The point now is to cover tracks and
keep everything clean on the surface.
When they call you in,
keep your mouth shut.
This is your cut from Lee. Four grand.
I gotta get to the hospital.
- Where are you gonna move him?
- I don't know.
- CHEN: To cover your old man.
- I can't.
Just take it.
Thanks.
Remember, don't say anything.
Let me deal with the FBI, all right?
Whoa-ho.
Hard to find you, Jack.
Tell her to take in a movie.
- CHEN: Go on!
- I wanted to call. I couldn't.
Now I'm here.
So, what do you want to tell me
about Benny Wong?
AGENT: Daniel Wallace? FBI.
Hi, could you pass
that letter off to my father?
He's in 409. Sean Wallace.
- Back off. What the hell is going on?
- AGENT: Don't be an ass.
Don't touch my gun or badge.
I'm active.
Fine. Let's just get out of here
real quietly, all right?
Just got a few questions
we'd like to ask you.
- Look, I got my father...
- We'll put someone on the door.
Pass it. Thank you.
- CHEN: Then everybody took off?
- JACK: Yeah.
Good.
You're coming with me.
Where?
You're gonna tell the feds you've been
working with Wallace and me.
That the hit on Benny was Fukienese...
and you're eager to testify
against Bobby Vu.
Do it right, I will back you
on trying to tip me before the hit.
Do it wrong,
I go out of my way to bury you.
So why the fuck didn't you tell me
you were Internal Affairs?
Confidential undercover assignment,
Pete.
Key word being "confidential,"
which nothing in the bureau is.
- Fuck yourself.
- Nobody knows except a few of us in IA.
Not even the commanding officer
in the 15th knows.
Well, now I know.
Bag man's kid. Internal Affairs. Wow.
Your old man must think
you're a real scumbag, huh?
Yeah.
Well...
So, what do you got on Chen?
This isn't a federal case.
No reason to tell you anything.
No, there is, actually.
Because from where I'm sitting,
it looks to me like a young IA rat...
went to build a case
against Nick Chen...
- ...and ended up working for him.
- You're reaching.
Enjoying for himself
the Chinatown whores...
and financial assistance
to help a family gambling problem.
Don't start with that.
I'll start and finish with it
unless somebody hands me Chen.
- He's here.
- SCHABACKER: Who's here?
AGENT: Chen.
Hello, Pete.
Nick.
Who's your friend?
CHEN: A buddy of Wallace's and mine.
He's an eyewitness
to the Benny Wong murder.
SCHABACKER: Hmm. Peanut?
Eyewitness?
And you bring him here to me. Why?
You know why.
My compliments, Wallace.
You must've sunk your hooks
into Chen pretty good, huh?
- What did he want?
- To trade for you.
KIRKPATRICK: He said that?
Not in so many words.
He brought that Fuke snitch of yours
who rode shotgun on the Wong killing.
He gives me the eyewitness, I call off
the FBI investigation on Wallace.
- KIRKPATRICK: What'd you tell him?
- Ah.
I told him fine.
Putting the kid back on the street to get
the rest of the Fukes on tape...
talking about the hit on Wong.
And in return, I'm not gonna press
charges on young Wallace here.
- Is Chen still here?
- SCHABACKER: No, he took off.
But you gotta promise me
that I can be there...
when you break the bad news
to Chen, heh...
because that's gonna be
fucking priceless.
Your wire's showing.
How long you been IA?
First assignment.
Quickest way to a gold shield and
all you gotta do is bury your partner.
The guy who shoved 10 grand
into your fist to back your play.
I figure you ain't worth much
to the Chinks yet...
so this must be Chen's money.
And you're gonna bury him.
And for what?
Turning his head?
Making a few dollars?
I know it wouldn't mean much to you,
Pop.
Lying and cheating
is what you're made of.
That's a hell of a lot better
than what you're made of.
You don't even know
what I'm made of, Pop.
It's the one thing
I should thank you for.
Your lack of interest.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
You've been real honest
with your partner.
Ends justifies the means, Pop.
The ends is bullshit.
The means...
is what you live with.
Keep it.
I don't want nothing from you.
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
TAI: Don't you like me?
Of course I like you.
I just need to go to the bathroom.
TAI: Huh.
Shit.
What the fuck are you doing?
DANNY: Where's the lieutenant?
He left.
He said he wanted you to be very happy.
The police are running in circles on
the unfortunate death of Uncle Benny.
Uncle Benny, yeah. We didn't kill him
for nothing, okay? Give us the money.
Then it's time to bring the cargo ship
to port and unload our freight.
One hundred eighty-six
at 40,000 apiece.
I'd say that's a nice start
to our relationship...
- ...wouldn't you?
- Ha, ha. Shit, yeah!
Hot tea.
The only time I was ever in here,
I was talking to my godfather.
- Uncle Benny was a great man.
- You would know better than anyone.
But even a great man
can outlast his time.
I've got something for you.
Should quiet any doubts
as to Wallace's character.
The Fukes are bringing in
a highly valuable cargo by ship.
Bobby Vu will be on site
supervising the unloading.
Take the Fukes and half the cargo.
I'll keep the other half.
You're getting greedy.
I'm an American.
Hey. Let's go.
We gotta pick up Jack
and send him to the feds.
What time is it?
Time for a shower. You stink.
- Got a match?
- Yeah.
You know, you were right.
- About what?
- I wish it was neither of us.
But the fact is,
I'm glad it's not just me.
Get up.
You sure it was Henry Lee?
It was him.
I think everybody here knows Assistant
U.S. Attorney Margaret Wheeler.
Gentlemen, tape's good.
Probably enough for convictions
on Bobby Vu and the rest.
I think we hold off.
We wait till they make their move
to bring in the illegal shipment.
We bust them on the ship,
then we go for the murder charge.
With Jack connecting the dots
to an ongoing criminal enterprise...
we get life sentences.
- What about Henry Lee?
- What about him?
Do we have a case, Pete?
Enough to drag Mr. Lee
before a grand jury.
It's his word against their word,
and he'll win.
We wait till after the shipment comes in,
then the tape's got merit.
Daniel, what are your thoughts?
It's Margaret's call.
WHEELER: Then we wait.
Everybody works round the clock.
As soon as Jack finds out
when delivery is set, we'll reconvene...
and make the arrests.
That's it, gentlemen.
- Thank you.
- Pleasure.
Nick, what do you say
after we bust the Fuke Dragons...
we get together, bury the hatchet, huh?
- Oh, can't wait.
- SCHABACKER: All right.
Danny, you up for that?
Oh, yeah. Sure.
Good.
Bacardi and Coke.
I'll get a Bud.
I got it.
The suckers lose themselves
In the games they love to play
I gave the fed to Lee.
The children love to sing
I know.
But then their voices slowly fade away
People always take a step away
I'm gonna have to answer for him
someday.
We all have something to answer for.
Yeah.
You do, you do, you do, you do
You do, you do
Ah.
Speak of the devil.
- Lee.
- CHEN: Yeah.
Order me another.
No apology because my urge is genuine
CHEN: It's Chen.
LEE :
I've been paging you all day.
What do you want?
Wallace is Internal Affairs.
- What?
- You heard me.
I don't believe it.
Your girlfriends found a wire on him
last night.
I checked it out, and the fuck
is making a case against you.
- You there?
- Yeah.
Who knows how long he was wired.
He's gotta go.
You kill him tonight.
The Fukes are taking delivery in one
hour, Pier 25 at Port Imperial in Jersey.
A ship called the Dorian.
Take him along, make sure he doesn't
leave the boat, you understand me?
I don't give a shit about the cargo, the
Fukes. Just make sure Wallace is dead.
Are we clear?
He'll hang us both.
Yeah.
I understand.
You get ahold of him?
CHEN: Yeah.
And did you tell him about the tape?
CHEN: No.
Well, what did he say?
CHEN:
He wanted to tell me that the Fukes...
are picking up the shipment
in an hour in Jersey.
Well, shit, we gotta move.
Did you call the feds?
Yeah.
They're gonna meet us there.
Well, let's go.
No sign of anybody.
Have a look.
- DANNY: Lee said an hour, right?
- Yeah.
- Still nothing?
- No.
Are you sure?
Yep. It's all clear.
What about Internal Affairs?
- What?
- I forgot to mention...
Lee thinks they are making a case
against someone in the 15th.
- Who?
- He didn't know.
Maybe it's just a rumor.
You hear anything?
- They're here.
- You keep watching.
We got to let them lead us
to the cargo.
MAN: Come on!
Go!
They're heading away from us.
CHEN: What would you do
if you knew IA had a case against you?
I don't know.
What would you do if you knew
your partner gave you up, amigo?
Answer me!
I'm asking you!
I don't know.
You should have let me die in the car
that day.
At least then I die a cop.
You are a cop.
You're a good cop.
I tell that to anybody that asks me.
And you?
I don't know.
All I know is you saved me
and you saved my father.
My life is really yours to do with
as you wish.
Wallace. Come here.
- DANNY: Maybe that's all of them.
- Bobby Vu is here.
He would never leave without us.
You mean without you.
- DANNY: Where?
- Come here.
No!
Fuck you!
Shit. Hold on.
You all right? You okay?
I'm so sorry.
Who sends a white cop undercover
in Chinatown?
I swear to God, I wish they never did.
Nick. Nick, can you hear me?
Nick.
Bring a fucking stretcher now!
Nick.
Nick.
It's just you and me.
I'm your partner.
Please.
Where's the stretcher?!
Nick, you gotta hold on.
You wanna get Wallace out here, please?
You wanna get Wallace out here, please?
Now.
KIRKPATRICK: What is this bullshit?
Exactly what it says.
After a month-long investigation,
I find no evidence...
supporting any charges against Chen.
SCHABACKER:
Think you can get away with this? Hmm?
Forget it, man. That man's responsible
for the death of a federal agent.
The man's dead.
And no matter what you believe,
the officer died a good fucking cop.
Move.
Henry Lee, you're under arrest.
I'd like to introduce you
to my attorney.
I'd like to introduce you to the inmates
at Rikers Island...
but that'll take a few weeks.
I was very saddened to hear
about your friend Lieutenant Chen.
Heh, I'm sorry.
He wasn't your friend after all, was he?
I'd like to thank you for killing
all the witnesses against me.
Not all.
Not the one who recorded this tape.
VU : We didn't kill him
for nothing. Give us the money.
LEE : Then it's time to bring
the ship to port and unload our freight.
One hundred eighty-six
at 40,000 apiece.
I'd say that's a nice start
to our relationship, wouldn't you?
VU: Ha, ha. Shit, yeah!
Let's go, hotshot. You're under arrest.
You have the right to remain silent.
You understand?
You have the right to refuse
to answer any questions.
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.
You have the right
to have an attorney present...
