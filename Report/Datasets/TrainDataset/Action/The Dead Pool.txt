Get off my ass.
He's going.
Did you recognize
any of the attackers?
Is this attack connected to your
testimony at the Janero trial?
Has Janero put out a contract
on your life?
Were these Janero's men?
Have you received death threats?
Has the department offered
any extra protection?
The department will issue
a complete statement...
...as soon as we've conducted
our own investigation.
$13,453.63.
That's how much
an unmarked squad car costs.
That's the third car
you've trashed this month.
- Lou Janero.
- What?
His men shot up the car.
Send him the bill.
Very funny.
See how funny it is behind a desk,
because you're off the street.
All this for a car?
At Lieutenant Ackerman's request.
The chief approved.
It's for your own good.
- If you think I'm gonna...
- Just until we handle Janero.
He may be in prison, but it's clear
he's calling the shots. Literally.
Can't have our newest hero turned to
Swiss cheese before the commendation.
See? You're getting a commendation.
Swell.
It's time we took advantage
of the press you're getting.
How do you propose to do that?
It's my opinion that you should
work with me in public relations.
Opinions are like assholes.
Everybody has one.
You don't realize what you've done
for the department's image.
You just put a major
crime figure in prison.
You've got an extremely high
visibility right now.
And for once, it's positive.
You know what that means
in terms of recruitment?
Look at this.
Look at this copy we're getting.
We've never been
this swamped for interviews.
I'm not some dog-and-pony act.
It's important we maximize your public
relations value while we can.
Getting close and personal
with reporters isn't my job.
Your job is to promote the department.
How positive would it be
if I resigned...
...lieutenant?
Don't misunderstand me.
Harry, all I'm asking for
is a little cooperation.
All right, we don't have to pull you
off the street completely.
If you'd just be more cooperative
with the press.
Anything else?
Yeah.
Quan, will you come in here?
Quan's moving over from the youth gang
task force to Homicide.
Good, Homicide can always use a cop
with Al's experience.
I'm glad you agree.
If you want to stay on the street,
you take Quan to watch your back.
- Now hold on.
- That's final.
That's swell, being that most
of my partners end up hurt or dead.
Ask Al how he feels about that.
Well, Quan? Any objections
to working with Callahan?
I think I can handle it.
Get a bulletproof vest, kid.
Teaming Harry with a Chinese-American
will be good for the department image.
You have any kids?
Me? No.
Lucky for them.
Cut. Cut!
You're out of sync, Johnny.
What's the problem here?
Where is that fool?
Jeff!
Jeff!
We've had a short, Peter.
You had all the bugs out.
"Trust me," you said.
- Right? Did he say that?
- "Trust me."
That means "fuck you"
in this business.
I checked it.
I've got a backup head.
Give me 20 minutes and we'll be ready.
All right, do it.
And no cock-ups this time.
And that goes for the rest
of you morons.
This sucks, man.
How can I sing
with shit exploding all over?
It was just an accident.
This whole movie is an accident.
How did I get talked into this shit?
You needed a video.
I needed this sequence for the film.
Stop complaining,
we're getting what we want.
Why couldn't we shoot on a warm
sound stage, instead of a meat locker?
I need it cold so the audience
can see your breath when you sing.
Brilliant.
We won't be original, but people
will know I froze my ass off.
What's that supposed to mean?
A director with talent would have
the guts to shoot something original.
Instead of ripping off old movies
like
This is not a rip-off,
it's a homage. You stupid...
Jesus, I don't believe you.
What?
You're hurting.
I don't know what you mean.
Don't give me that.
You promised, not during shooting.
I know what I'm doing.
I can handle it.
You won't fuck up my film!
I said, I can handle it!
Just let me go back to the trailer
and get it together.
Then we'll kick some ass.
- OIKK?
- OIKK.
Can I get a Coke?
Get a Coke, please, for Johnny.
Now what?
Don't worry,
Johnny's like a trained seal.
Throw him a fish, he'll perform.
Rise and shine, boys.
Time to get up.
What's happening?
I always knew working Homicide
would be glamorous.
I mean, meeting celebrities and all.
Too bad you can't get his autograph.
You know, Harry,
they always die in threes.
When one celebrity dies, two more
always go in a week or two.
It's a fact, Harry.
Celebrities always die in threes.
Well, this one's got crystalline
powder around his nose and mouth.
Scabs up and down both arms.
Fresh puncture marks
on his left forearm.
Yeah, Homicide can be
really glamorous.
All right,
check the dummy out, please.
Meagan.
I want a three-inch lens, very tight.
Try not to drop it.
Let's hurry up and shoot this
and wrap this up, please.
And my second assistant and I
found Johnny in his trailer.
He was just lying there.
At first we thought it was a joke.
- But then, well...
- When did you last see him alive?
About a half-hour before that.
He went back to his trailer
while we set up.
Was he alone?
I don't know.
But he was alone when we found him.
Tell me, does anyone
on your set use drugs?
We don't do drugs, Callahan.
We do film.
Look, what people do
is their own business.
If it doesn't interfere with my film,
I really don't give a shit.
What about Squares? Was he using?
How should I know?
Johnny had agents, lawyers, friends.
It was their job to deal with his
drug problem, not mine.
Well, that's a very caring attitude.
What do you want, Callahan?
Drugs were Johnny's trademark.
He made his career singing about them.
It made him controversial.
I can see why you'd want him
in your flick.
It was a marketing decision.
Johnny Squares sells tickets.
You know, bums on seats, love.
Besides, we needed
a music video tie-in.
Any idea who was supplying him?
No, but if I hear of anything,
you'll be the first one I call.
Marvelous.
Check on anyone
who dealt with Squares.
- Whether it was the cast or crew...
- Inspector Callahan.
Inspector.
Shit.
Is it true that Johnny Squares OD'd?
We're conducting an investigation.
Right as we speak.
At this point, nothing's been...
Thank you, inspector.
Excuse me, are you Suzanne Dayton?
What's going on here?
Johnny?
Johnny?
Hold it. I'm sorry,
you have to step back.
- No, Johnny!
- There's nothing they can do.
You're gonna make yourself sick.
Hold on, could we
give her a little air?
Out of the way, please.
Off with that camera.
I can film whatever I want.
IKKeep shooting.
This is someone else's heartache.
Right in here.
What are you doing? Give me that.
Smart.
High and Dry
Hotel Satan.
What's that all about?
My past catching up with me.
As a kid, I was in the gang
that hit him up for protection money.
All my life, I've been running in
gangs or trying to put them away.
So I figured I'd come over to Homicide
for something different.
It's different, all right.
Call for backup.
Come on, get the fuck out of here.
Hurry up!
Move it! Move it!
Put your money on the table!
Hurry up!
Don't move!
Don't fuck with me, lady!
Come on, guys, hurry up!
- You forgot your fortune cookie.
- What!?
It says:
"You're shit out of luck."
Get out of the way!
"Teaming up with a Chinese-American is
good for the department's image."
Who was he?
Some guy in the wrong place
at the wrong time.
Madison. Dean Madison was his name.
Does it ring a bell?
- Never heard of him.
- Well, he knew you, Harry.
I found this in his pocket.
It's a list of celebrities.
Tony Engelhart, the pro linebacker.
Michael Cipriano, the race car driver.
Oh, and one Inspector Harry Callahan.
Johnny Squares is on that list.
See what's written by his name?
Yeah, RIP. "Rest in peace."
You know what this is?
It's a bill for a TV camera and lens.
When I said stop wrecking cars,
I didn't mean destroy something else.
They interfered
with an investigation, sir.
Don't give us that. Is this
your idea of media cooperation?
Cooperation works two ways.
What is it you have against reporters?
Some of them
are just marvelous people.
Others walk through a pile and track
it through an investigation.
You better change
your attitude fast.
Because unless we
reach an agreement with them...
...it's liable to cost this city
Join us, please.
This is Ms. Samantha Walker
of station IKKWSF.
Captain Donnelly.
- Ms. Walker.
- Captain.
- And this is Inspector...
- Callahan. We've met.
Yes, of course. Won't you sit down?
Ms. Walker...
...Lieutenant Ackerman tells me
you have a proposal to make...
...regarding the accidental
damage to...
There was nothing accidental about it.
The department might have something
to say about that.
Although the camera was destroyed...
...I have the entire
incident on video.
I see.
And your proposal?
We may be willing to drop
the lawsuit against the city...
...but that depends
on Inspector Callahan.
I'm sure the inspector
would be willing to...
What do you have in mind?
Dinner.
I owe you an apology.
You were right
about what I did the other day.
I had no business intruding
on that girl's grief.
I get too eager sometimes.
In my rush to get the story,
I made an error in judgement.
We all make those sometimes.
No, I should have known better.
I'm sorry.
- Let me ask you, Miss Walker...
- Sam.
Sam.
Do you like cops?
If they're not in my
rear-view mirror. Why?
I wonder what
we're supposed to talk about...
...other than the damaged camera.
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm letting the insurance company
deal with that.
And I think I can be persuaded
to drop the lawsuit...
...but I want something in return.
What would that be?
I want your story.
What's that?
I've done my homework on you.
You've had quite a colorful career.
Loot at this. You see...
...there's a lot of interest right now
in the Janero case...
...and the cop who put him in prison.
Channel 8 is doing a news special
on organized crime in the Bay Area.
But what I would like to do
is an in-depth profile...
...of you, Inspector Harry Callahan.
Sorry, I'm not interested.
Why not? This latest attempt
on your life by one of Janero's men...
You're not interested
in doing a story on me.
You want blood. That's what sells...
- Now wait a minute...
- No, you wait a minute.
You people are interested
in death and mayhem...
...and you don't care
how you get the story.
That is not fair. That's not
the kind of journalism I do.
To you I'm just a cop
with a price on his head.
Let me tell you, I don't like
people saying they're gonna kill me.
Nor do I like journalists using it
as a way to increase ratings.
- What I was going to say...
- That's the end of the story.
Sorry.
The coroner's report last night...
...said that Squares used speedballs.
Injecting cocaine and heroin?
But that's not what killed him.
He was using an inhaler
with some new designer drug.
A synthetic form of heroin.
You mean something along the lines
of China White.
Only a thousand times wore powerful.
One snort and he went into
immediate respiratory failure.
IKKnow what I'm trying to figure?
Why is a guy like that...
...screwing with synthetic junk
when he's got the real stuff?
Maybe he didn't know
what he was using.
Harry.
Harry?
Sorry about that.
Get you next time.
Check the cast and crew
for prior drug busts.
I'll check with Narcotics to see if any
dealers are moving synthetic heroin.
Harry, there's something here
you should see.
Tribune...
"There is no man who is master of the
breath of life so as to retain it...
...and none has mastery
over the day of death.
For the Lord of all
shows no partiality...
...nor does He fear greatness...
...because He himself
made the great...
...as well as the small.
And He provides for all alike.
And the dust returns to the
earth, as it once was.
And the life breath
returns to God, who gaveth."
My condolences.
Mrs. Dayton, I'm terribly sorry.
Suzanne, I'm very sorry
for your trouble.
Thank you.
My sympathies, dear.
Do you mind, gentlemen?
I happen to be at a funeral.
I'd like to talk about your list.
It's no big secret.
The cast and crew knew about it.
The Dead Pool is just a harmless game.
It sounds pretty sick to me.
Let me tell you something.
People are fascinated
with death and violence.
That's why my films make money.
They're an escape,
a vicarious release of fear.
Same thing with this game.
Nobody takes my films
or the Dead Pool seriously.
Someone gave Squares the drugs
that killed him. Maybe you.
You can't tie me to Johnny's death
because of a coincidence.
My assistant and effects supervisor
played too. Why not talk to them?
We will.
But nobody on their list is dead yet.
Johnny was a drug user and I predicted
he'd die this year. That's all.
The idea is to pick celebrities
who won't make it...
...because they're old, sick
or in a high-risk profession.
Like police work?
Nothing personal.
I don't like being on your list, Swan.
That's what this is really about,
isn't it?
If you have a choice...
Maybe I'll start my own Pool
and put you on it.
Are you threatening me?
If you want to play the game,
you'd better know the rules, love.
That's our report. I'm Patrick Snow.
I'm Samantha Walker.
Thank you for being with us.
Tune in tonight
for an exclusive report...
...on chemical dependency
among celebrities.
Who they are, why they do it...
...and the price they pay.
Tonight at 11.
Good night.
And we're clear.
Thought I'd seen the last of you.
I saw your report yesterday.
We confirmed it
with people in the game.
Vicky Owens, Swan's assistant,
and effects supervisor, Jeff Howser.
It didn't occur to you
to clear it with us first?
I had to go with the story.
The papers got the same tip.
I had to get the story out fast.
Or someone else would get it first?
- Something like that.
- How were you tipped?
By mail. A copy of the Dead Pool
and a letter explaining it.
- It's already started.
- What has?
All the media bullshit.
Newspapers print the Dead Pool
and it hurts our investigation.
What bothers you...
...is that we found out about
the Dead Pool first.
You people take Janero and the Dead
Pool, add hype and distortion...
...and innocent people get hurt.
Aren't you overreacting?
I've seen it happen.
I don't like the hype, either...
...but it happens when reporters
compete for a story.
Why don't you start thinking about
your responsibility to the public?
You can't kill the messenger
because of the message.
I'm sorry, it wasn't my intention
to screw up your investigation.
Here's the list. Now, excuse me.
Thanks.
It seems I owe you one.
Dinner, that is.
I was offered a job as an anchor
at this small, local station.
Because...
...I was first runner-up
in Miss Colorado.
Colorado? We're right over here.
But I had absolutely no experience,
just my bachelor's in journalism.
But it was a way in, so I grabbed it.
But I didn't just smile at
the camera and read copy.
I did anything and everything
at this station.
Sports, news, hard news, weather.
I produced documentaries.
I love San Francisco.
But it isn't easy.
Big city, big news.
I had to prove myself all over again.
Have you succeeded?
Somewhat.
Apparently not with you.
I shouldn't complain. At least you
stayed for dinner this time.
I'd still love to do your story.
No, thanks.
You're wrong about me, Callahan,
and what I want to do.
I wish I could convince you.
I'll tell you what.
Let's think on it.
Sounds fair.
Thank you.
It's the truth,
I don't care what you say.
Hey, Callahan.
- You're Callahan, aren't you?
- That's right.
What can I do for you?
You're the cop who put Janero away.
All I want is your autograph.
Can I shake your hand?
I'd just like to thank you.
It's about time somebody
did something about Janero.
Could you sign it to
Chester Docksteder? That's me.
Let me buy you a drink.
Some other time.
We need more cops like you.
That's what we need.
I gotta change my shorts.
What are you laughing at?
This is your 15 minutes, Callahan.
Andy Warhol said everybody's famous
for 15 minutes. Well, this is it.
Swell.
Was it your first autograph?
Yeah.
And I hope my last.
You know something?
I don't think Lou Janero
likes you very much.
She's okay. Just a little shaken up.
How're you doing, girl?
Whatever they're paying you, Harry,
it couldn't be enough.
My colleagues.
I don't want to be the news.
Let's get you out of here.
You sure you want to see this guy?
Yeah.
Here's your animal.
Hicks.
What the fuck do you want?
I brought you some cigarettes.
And what would I have to do for you?
Nothing. Just stand where I tell you.
Stay right here.
Fifth cell down.
That's the trouble with this prison.
They let anybody in.
I don't like scum like you
trying to kill me.
Sounds to me like this Dead Pool thing
is making you a little paranoid.
Oh, yeah. I heard about it.
Good news travels fast.
Big fucking media hero.
Hero today and gone tomorrow.
Call off your guns.
What are you talking about?
Your trouble is, you have
too much time on your hands.
What you need is a job.
A what?
A job.
I'm gonna give you a job
being a postman, understand?
It'll be your job to see
the mail gets through.
See that gorilla down there?
That's Butcher Hicks, and he's killed
three men. You know how?
He tore them apart with his teeth.
Never found all the pieces.
He has an unhealthy appetite.
So what?
So Hicks there is my new pen pal.
I'll write him once a week...
...about how I'm looking in
on his sick mother...
...and trying to get him
special privileges here.
And the interesting part is,
if anything happens to me...
...and Hicks doesn't get his letter...
...he'll be really pissed off.
And he'll come to see you...
...because you're the mailman.
He'll probably come down here
and cancel your ass like a stamp.
You better ensure prompt,
courteous delivery.
And pray nothing happens to me.
- That's it?
- That's it.
See that dirtbag
I was talking to down there?
He says smoking can cause cancer...
...and anyone who smokes as much
as you do is one dumb son of a bitch.
Fire!
Cut!
Cut! Cut.
Where is that stupid fuck? Hauser!
Get your ass down here.
You're supposed to harpoon
the goddamn dummy.
The tide shifted.
"The tide shifted."
The ocean's incompetent, not you.
This is the third time this week.
You'll never work for me again.
There's a bunch
of reporters down there.
Come on, come on.
Can we ask you a few questions?
Please!
I'd like to say one thing.
In light of what's happened...
...perhaps playing the Dead Pool game
isn't smart.
Any tie between the Dead Pool
and Squares' death?
None whatsoever. Next question.
Mr. Swan, will the game continue?
No, we're filming a nightmare
sequence at the shipyards...
...and we'd like to forget this
and get on with our job.
Johnny would have wanted it that way.
First Squares died, then your
production accountant was killed.
Is  cursed?
People can believe what they want,
but nothing...
Nothing will stop me
from making this film.
End of interview.
Whatever you want,
money, credit cards, just take it.
Ever notice how time
slows down at night?
Just like in my films. A dream world.
Shut up!
I can't hear the colors.
I've got to hear them.
That's the mark of a good director,
you have to hear the colors.
You've gotta be able
to taste the sounds.
I have a heart condition.
A critic with a heart.
That's a laugh.
Do you like my films?
- I said, do you like my films?
- Who are you?
- You know who I am.
- I don't. I don't know you.
God...
...what kind of a film critic are you?
!
!
!
Peter Swan.
Brilliant, love.
What do you think of my films?
Give me your honest opinion.
I like them.
Liar!
The entrance is probably
through the sliding glass door.
She wasn't sexually assaulted.
IKKilled sometime last night.
Maid found her this morning.
Do you recognize her?
Molly Fisher. Famous movie critic.
On a scale of 1 to 10,
...I'd have to rate this one an 8.
Harry, we found this.
Thanks.
Dead Pool.
Molly Fisher's also
on Peter Swan's list.
Those are just some of the highlights
of Peter Swan's films.
The typeface is the same as those sent
to the papers and TV stations.
And the neighbor saw a man exiting
Molly Fisher's condo last night.
Mid-30s, wearing a black jacket.
I want Swan in custody now.
It doesn't feel right.
Doesn't feel right?
Every celebrity on this list has
called in the last couple days.
They're all screaming
for police protection.
We don't have the manpower
to be 24-hour babysitters.
Ackerman is whining about the negative
publicity this case is giving us.
And your name
is on this list too, Callahan.
My gut feeling tells me Swan is the
best suspect we have...
...so get his butt in here!
Donnelly.
What?
It's for you, Callahan.
We'll be right there.
Wait a minute. Where are you going?
To do my job.
I think we've got our man.
You all stay back.
Everyone.
I'm gonna go up.
Where's the news crew?
You better get them here.
I mean it. Now!
What's up?
Name's Gus Wheeler.
He says he's the Dead Pool killer.
We found him like this.
He's soaked in gas and threatening
to set himself on fire.
Why not hose him down?
He says if he sees a fireman or even
a garden hose, he'll torch himself.
What's he want?
To be on television.
He wants a cameraman and a reporter.
Al and I will just pose as...
It has to be someone he recognizes.
Stay back. Stay back from me.
It's gonna go up. You hear me?
Better keep those people back.
- You all right?
- Not really.
Stop right there! That's far enough.
I'm Samantha Walker from...
- I know who you are!
- What do you want?
Is that camera on?
You want to know why I'm doing this?
Because nobody cares.
We care, Mr. Wheeler...
No! Nobody ever paid
any attention to me before.
In order to get attention,
you gotta do something.
Well, I'm really gonna
do something this time!
Did you have anything
to do with the deaths...
...of Johnny Squares and Molly Fisher?
No, I just said that so you'd listen!
I want everyone to see this!
I want everyone to remember me!
And to remember what I did here!
Oh, Jesus, Harry, he's
really gonna do it.
That's right, lady. I'm really
gonna set myself on fire.
And it's gonna be on the news...
...and then finally everybody
will know about me.
About me! Gus Wheeler!
No one's going to see you die.
What?
I said, no one's gonna see you die.
Not if we stop filming.
You can talk to me
and tell me your story...
...but we won't film your suicide.
What are you doing?
- Turn the camera back on!
- We're not gonna film it!
- We're not.
- She's right.
You can set yourself on fire
and we'll roast marshmallows.
But you won't be on
You're ruining everything.
Give me the flare.
You've got plenty of coverage.
You think so?
Trust me.
Okay.
Harry, you okay?
- You hurt?
- No, I'm fine.
Get that gurney over here, quick!
You all right?
Oh, God, Harry.
This man sets himself on fire.
And it's my fault.
It was an accident.
Maybe if we'd have kept filming.
That's exactly what he wanted.
What you did took guts. Most people
would have gone for the exclusive.
Reel three, George.
Just a moment.
What is this? Why the fuck
are you harassing me?
I was at a party when
Fisher was killed.
I was there until 2,
and I have witnesses.
We know that. We checked.
Somebody's trying to make us think
that you killed Squares and Fisher.
Any idea who it is?
Are you kidding? It could be anyone.
They all hate me.
My former agent.
My producers, my crew. The public.
They envy my talent so much
they wish to destroy it.
You don't believe me?
Talk to my secretary.
She'll show you the letters I get.
Warnings, death threats...
I get so many,
I don't pay attention anymore.
I'll check on it.
Tell me...
...anyone else have
a jacket like this?
Most of my crew. Why?
Maybe it was someone in your crew,
or who's worked for you in the past.
Whoever's doing these murders uses
your films and you as inspiration.
Nolan IKKennard Show.
First Johnny Squares, then Molly
Fisher, now Nolan IKKennard.
- Like I said, celebrities always die...
- In threes, yeah.
- At least the guy went out with a...
- A bang, I know.
- What do you have, Russ?
- Hello, Harry.
From the residue on the frags,
I'd say plastic. Probably C3 or 4.
We'll do an analysis back at the lab.
- Let me know the results.
- You got it.
What's that?
I don't know.
It looks like the wheel from a toy.
Have you been questioned about
Nolan IKKennard?
Is his death connected
to the Dead Pool?
- I don't know.
- Is his death due to your list?
- I don't know.
- In
...a character's poisoned.
has several stabbings.
- We can guess what ...
- Get to the point.
Are there parallels between the deaths
in your film...
...and the death of Johnny Squares?
That's a stupid question!
Do you feel any responsibility?
You people are
blowing this out of proportion.
Callahan!
You.
Harry.
I think that's about it for me.
What's that tattoo?
Oh, that.
One of my grandfather's superstitions.
You see, he painted these words
on my back and chest.
It's supposed to ward off
anything that's harmful or evil.
When he heard I was your partner,
he figured I could use the help.
I was just trying
to honor the old guy.
Besides, I didn't think it could hurt.
Listen, I think I'm gonna go home.
I'll catch you later for a beer.
- See him?
- I saw him.
He can't be over there.
How y'all doing?
You're the last asshole Janero sends.
Wait, you got it wrong!
Don't fuck with me, buddy.
I'll kick your ass right now.
It's not what you think.
Janero did hire us.
But this ain't a hit.
Janero doesn't want
anything to happen to you.
We're your...
...bodyguards.
Those letters
all came from your files.
Harlan Rook. God.
Yes, I remember him.
Every time I was at a film festival
or a seminar, he was there.
Mr. IKKnow-It-AII, I called him.
He knew everything about my films.
To tell the truth,
I found it a little unnerving.
What'd he want?
He had this screenplay...
...for a horror film
he wanted me to direct.
He said it'd be
the ultimate Peter Swan film.
He was crazy.
I couldn't get rid of him.
Finally, my attorney
put a restraining order on him.
Then what happened?
I didn't see or hear from him again.
That must have been over a year ago.
Is he the one?
The typewriter
used on these letters...
...is the same one used
to tip us off to the Dead Pool.
Call Swan's attorney
and see what he knows about Rook.
And run a DMV check.
Right.
It might not be a bad idea to start
playing it a little safe.
Maybe your granddaddy can paint me up.
Look, I'm being serious.
Don't go where you normally go,
not even home. You can stay with me.
Thanks, but I think I can
do a little better.
Price of fame.
Is this what Ackerman meant
by cooperating with the press?
It must have been one of those
in-depth interviews.
I got a lead on Rook.
A psychiatrist who treated him.
Good.
- Give it a try.
- Okay.
It won't respond.
Someone's on my frequency.
Forget it. It's just not working.
Now what the hell is that?
Time's up, Callahan.
You all right, Al?
Shit.
Two fractured ribs.
He bled in the chest.
We drained it and set up an IV.
He's lucky, the bulletproof vest
he had on saved his life.
Another of my
grandfather's superstitions.
When your partner gives you advice...
...take it.
Harry.
This is Dr. Friedman, chief
psychiatrist here at the hospital.
I'm sorry about what happened.
I feel somewhat responsible.
Your partner contacted me about
a former patient of ours.
- Harlan Rook?
- Yes.
At first, I didn't recall the name.
I found the file today.
He was evaluated here a year ago.
The diagnosis was
process schizophrenia.
Multiple personality.
Exactly.
His sense of self-hate
was so strong...
...that he no longer had
any personality of his own.
Consequently,
he substituted identities...
...found in books, films...
...fan magazines.
Identities with which he had
love-hate relationships.
He wasn't dangerous enough to hold?
Most mentally ill people
are not violent, inspector.
By law, a person who poses no danger
can only be held for 72 hours.
I'm sorry, this is one instance
where the system failed.
Is this address recent?
I assume it's still the same.
Samantha Walker.
I see.
No doubt about it.
He's our boy, Harry.
Explosives. Caps.
Detonator.
It all connects.
Harry, you gotta see this.
Talk about obsession.
Looks like he had a real
Peter Swan shrine going here.
I'm not sure.
I could have sworn I put it in my bag.
But I'm not sure.
- Bob, do you have my little mike?
- It's in your bag.
Thank you.
Look at this.
I'll call the TV station.
Samantha went out to the shipyard
to interview Peter Swan.
Swan doesn't know anything about it.
- What's this?
- A payroll stub.
Sundown Security, made out to
Ed Butler? I don't get it.
That's the company that provides
security for Swan's locations.
Ed Butler may be an alias for Rook.
Where are you going? Harry?
Harry!
That's my car!
Yes.
That's the shot I'm looking for.
What is it you want from me?
You've got it wrong, love.
This is what you wanted.
An exclusive interview.
But you're not Swan.
Shut up! You don't know!
You don't know!
I know who I am.
Do you know who you are?
Do you?!
Yes.
All those films he made.
Those are my nightmares, not his!
Every night I dream,
and somehow he reads my mind.
He stole my thoughts.
He put my thoughts on film,
and he takes all the credit.
He can't get away with it.
He has to pay.
He stole my nightmares
and made them real.
So I stole his Dead Pool.
I'll play his game and make it real.
He can take credit for that.
Drop it, Rook.
You didn't die, Callahan,
so I had to find another celebrity.
You're next.
Shoot me, Callahan.
Maybe you'll get lucky.
Maybe my muscles won't contract
and drive this knife into her throat.
Let her go.
First the gun.
Drop it and kick it over to me.
Time's up. What's it gonna be?
What the fuck?
You've locked yourself in, asshole.
Yeah.
Just you and me, asshole.
The gun, Callahan.
Now!
No!
He'll kill us both!
Oh, God.
You let me down,
Mr. Famous-Fucking-Cop.
You let Swan get away.
You're the killer, not Swan.
I should have killed you first.
That was my big mistake.
Now kick it over to me.
Harry, don't.
Think you're smart, don't you?
Callahan, you son of a bitch!
I'm gonna kill you slow!
Do you hear that, Callahan?!
Stay in there.
Callahan!
Come on out, Callahan.
There's nowhere left to run, Callahan.
Don't make me come in and get you.
The game's over!
You're out of bullets.
You know what that means.
You're shit out of luck.
- Where's Rook?
- He's hanging out back there.
Inspector, was this another
hit attempt by Janero?
Is it connected to the Dead Pool case?
