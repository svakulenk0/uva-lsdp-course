It's a fucking hot box.
Man, the fucking dirt here
tastes like dog shit.
Oh, well, you'd know, wouldn't you?
Shut the fuck up.
MAN 1:
Breacher up!
I got a military-age male...
...that's on a cell phone,
watching the convoy. Over.
OFFICER:
...you have a green light. Your call.
Over.
Maybe he's just calling his old lady. Heh.
He stepped off.
Hold on, I got a woman and a kid 200 yards
out, moving towards the convoy.
Her arms aren't swinging.
She's carrying something.
She's got a grenade. She got a RKG Russian
grenade she just handed to the kid.
OFFICER:
You got eyes on this?
Can you confirm?
Negative. You know the R.O.E.
Your call.
They fry you if you're wrong.
They send your ass to Leavenworth.
- You got him.
- Heh.
Now get back here.
You don't ever leave
your rifle in the dirt.
Yes, sir.
It was a hell of a shot, son.
You got a gift.
You're gonna make a fine hunter someday.
PASTOR:
Here in the Book of Acts...
...several times,
Paul stands in judgment...
...for what he believes.
At times, we all have to do that.
I mean, we don't see with his eyes...
...so we don't know the glory of his plan.
Our lives unfold before us like
puzzling reflections in a mirror.
-  What are you doing?
- Shh. Shh.
PASTOR: But on the day we rise,
we will see with clarity...
...and understand the mystery of his ways.
Let us pray.
WAYNE:
There are three types
of people in this world.
Now, some people prefer to believe
that evil doesn't exist in the world.
And if it ever darkened their doorstep, they
wouldn't know how to protect themselves.
Those are the sheep.
And then you got predators.
Come on, Jeff, punch him.
And then there are those who've been
blessed with the gift of aggression...
...and the overpowering need
to protect the flock.
...that live to confront the wolf.
They are the sheepdog.
Now, we're not raising any sheep
in this family.
- I will whup your ass if you turn into a wolf.
- Wayne.
But we protect our own.
If someone tries to fight you...
...or tries to bully your little brother,
you have my permission to finish it.
The guy was picking on Jeff.
Is that true?
Yes, sir. Yes, he was.
Did you finish it?
ANNOUNCER: Chris Kyle draws the horse
Big Business here this evening.
I'm doing all right.
That's good.
So tonight he needs to beat
the leading score of 86.
The louder you cheer,
the longer he'll ride!
MAN:
Come on! Yeah!
WOMAN:
Jeff, looks like your brother did it again!
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
Chris Kyle!
Man, wasn't nobody there,
and you come out with a belt buckle.
- What are you supposed to with it?
- Supposed to get laid with it.
I'll wear it,
see if it puts Sarah in the mood.
Shit, a strong wind'll put Sarah
in the mood.
- Is that what they say?
- You know what they called her...
...in high school
- Don't say it.
- Sarah Sucks-a-Lotta...
- What I say?!
Shit, Chris.
Goddamn it.
JEFF:
Oh, buckle bunny, those are two girls.
No, he kept looking... He had his eyes
on her, and that's why the last time...
Wait till you see what this does.
Let's see him go!
Baby, who wants
to fuck a rodeo sta...? What the fuck?!
You said you wasn't coming home
until tomorrow.
- I said what?
- Leave him alone. He didn't do anything!
MAN: Easy! I didn't know shit, man.
CHRIS: Come out here!
Chris, leave him alone! Fucking Chris,
leave him alone! Goddamn it!
- He didn't know, all right?!
- Oh, he didn't know.
- What didn't you know?
- I didn't know. Just give me my hat.
SARAH: He didn't know.
- Get his hat, babe.
Whose rifles did you think those were?
Them men's clothes were hers?
You didn't know,
you fucking son of bitch?
What the fuck is wrong with you?
You don't have to fucking punch everyone!
CHRIS: Put that fucking hat on
and get the fuck out.
SARAH:
What the fuck is wrong with you?
- Get out.
- You know what...
...I don't know
what you expect from me.
You just drag me out here and then you run
off with your brother every damn weekend.
Why do you think I did this, huh?
I do this to get attention,
don't you get that?
Get your stuff and get out.
Fine. You know what? Fuck you. Fine.
You think you're a cowboy
because you rodeo.
You're not a cowboy.
You're just a lousy ranch hand.
And you're a shitty fucking lay!
Don't say it.
When's the wedding?
JEFF:
I understand what you're saying...
...but, you know,
we get to travel over the whole state.
Different city every weekend.
Broncs and steers.
I don't know, maybe she's right, though.
"She's right"?
Right about what, Chris?
She's not right, man.
We're cowboys, we're living the dream.
ANNOUNCER:
KOPPEL: Those explosions
set to go off at the U.S. embassies...
...in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania
and Nairobi, Kenya...
...were clearly a part of someone's war
against the United States.
...more than 1700 injured
in two bomb blasts today...
Hey, Jeff. Jeff.
...which exploded just minutes
and 450 miles apart.
Look at this.
It is still unclear who our enemy is. Although
the embassies were obviously the targets...
Look what they did to us.
...most of the dead and injured
are not Americans.
Still, eight Americans, including one child,
are dead and five are still missing.
- So you're from Texas.
- Yes, sir.
- And you're a patriot.
- Yes, sir.
And you're pissed off.
I'm looking to be of service.
- Do you like to fight?
- Yes, sir.
You like to fight. Okay, well,
I want you to meet the warrior elite.
CHRIS:
SEALs.
Yup. Sea, Air and Land.
Well, I'm not much for the water, sir.
No? Well, this ain't for the faint-a-heart.
Most men, they wash out, they quit.
Well, I'm not most men, sir. I don't quit.
TONY: This is where the fun stops!
ROLLE: Take it, girls.
TONY:
It's gonna get harder from here on out.
ROLLE: That's it. Take it. Take it.
Only hurts the first time.
What we got here?
You a quitter, boy?
- Hooyah, no, Instructor Rolle.
- Bullshit! Your ass is fleet meat...
...if I ever did see it!
Don't turn away from me, son.
You look at me and you take this shit.
Hooyah. yes!
You old as fuck! You join the Navy because you
had such a good goddamn time on Noah's ark?
How old are you, boy?
- Hooyah, 30!
- 30?!
Your fart dust could've fathered
half these boys!
We gonna weed through the quitters.
Yeah, we gonna find us
a goddamn warrior or two today.
TONY:
Dauber, you sure you from Connecticut?
I ain't never met no hick
from Hartford before.
Hooyah, Instructor Friday.
Country's countrywide.
I came here to kill terrorists.
ROLLE:
Who the fuck told your ass to giggle?
Hooyah, no one, Instructor Rolle!
- Did I ask you to open up your mouth?
BIGGLES: Hooyah, no, Instructor Rolle.
ROLLE:
Look at your fat, pasty, giggly ass.
Damn, son.
You a big Dr. Pepper,
Cheeto-eating motherfucker!
Yeah! That's what I'm talking about.
Biggles! That's your name
from now on, sunshine.
And that's your ticket home.
"D"! What are you still doing in my
line trying to make this team?
Everybody knows black guys don't swim.
It's all right, sir.
I'm not black!
- No?
- No, I'm the new black.
We run slow, we jump low, we swim good
and we shop at Gap.
And I make the white folk proud
when I hose down their ladies.
I dick them down!
MAN:
Chicken!
There it is.
That is a quitter.
You say goodbye, I say good riddance.
He quits on you here,
he gonna quit in the field of battle.
When shit gets hairy, he won't step up.
Your ass gets shot, he won't pull you out.
RECRUITS: Six.
ROLLE: I'm looking for warriors!
- Seven.
- Keep counting!
- Eight!
- I can't hear you!
Nine!
TONY: Want me to call your mama?
Maybe she can come and take your place!
ROLLE:
This is foreplay!
I'm about to turn on some Marvin Gaye
and get in that ass!
That's what I'm talking about!
TONY: Squirrel, Squirrel, Squirrel,
where the fuck are your nuts?
Oh, they're gone for good, sir.
They crawled back up inside.
But they are warm!
TONY:
Big talk from a little man!
Now, you.
How about you, old man? Huh?
How you feeling?
Hooyah! Dangerous. Feeling dangerous.
Hooyah! Kyle's feeling dangerous!
Move!
TONY:
Take seats!
D:
Yeah! 56 degrees! So fresh, so clean!
MAN: Here she comes!
TONY: Mother Nature's got something for you!
Only a few more hours
and you're Navy SEALs!
RECRUITS :
TONY:
RECRUITS:
I'm the only one who's hit one, so...
D:
Boom!
D:
Oh, yeah! Chris, your turn, man.
- You got one more.
D: I got one more? All right.
All right. One more. Here we go.
Hey, we want a smaller target
we'll use your arm, man.
Hello.
Hi.
How you doing?
Good. Thank you.
Can I get you a drink?
Will a drink make you
six inches taller and charming?
Will it make you not married?
I'm not ma...
Yeah, I just watched you
take your ring off, okay?
Don't be a scumbag. Go home.
Oh, my God.
It may have been the leather pants.
Oh, yeah?
What kind of pants does a girl
have to wear to be left alone?
Well, maybe corduroy.
I mean, is that how it is with you guys?
You're suddenly single after three beers?
Oh, no, after three beers
all I know is to get a fourth.
That's great. That's great.
Real redneck.
- Oh, I'm not a redneck, I'm from Texas.
- Mm.
What's the difference?
Well, we ride horses...
...and they ride their cousins.
What do you do for work?
You're obviously military.
Oh, uh, I polish dolphins.
They're in captivity.
What I do is just sort of scrape off
the crustaceans...
Do I look stupid to you?
No, honestly, you look a little sad.
Am I tall enough to buy you a drink?
Not until you tell me what you do.
Okay, how about this. Hey, Greg?
Get two shots?
How about we do a shot for a question.
Every time you ask me a question
that I answer, do a shot.
- Same, vice versa.
- Game on.
You can leave the bottle too.
Okay, shoot.
All right. Ahem.
You're obviously military.
What branch?
I just finished BUD/S,
heading to sniper school.
Are you kidding me? You're a SEAL?
Yes, ma'am.
That's two questions.
- Shit.
- Ha, ha.
Really?
Oh, I didn't really mean
you had to do that. Heh.
Okay. Shit.
I know all about you guys.
My sister was engaged to a SEAL.
- Oh, was she?
- Yeah.
- Mm.
- Mm-hm.
Hold on, how you know all about us?
What do you mean?
What I mean is, you're a bunch
of arrogant, self-centered pricks...
...who think you can lie and cheat
and do whatever the fuck you want.
I'd never date a SEAL.
Wait, why would you say I'm self-centered?
I'd lay down my life for my country.
Why?
It's the greatest country on Earth.
I'd do everything I can to protect it.
Look, I'm sorry what happened
to your sister, but that's not me.
It's nice to meet you.
Where you going?
Just gonna go home because
you said you wouldn't date a SEAL, so...
I said I'd never marry one.
Oh. Okay. Well, then, maybe, hello.
Nice to meet you.
- What's your name?
- Taya.
Taya.
Chris. I'm Chris Kyle.
Nice to meet you.
Pleasure.
I mean, it's pretty egotistical of you to
think you can protect us all. Isn't it, Chris?
Well, our BUD/S office commander said
that it's three...
Okay.
He said there's three things we gotta
worry about: ego, booze and women.
Well...
...it sounds like you're under attack.
CHRIS:
You're pretty.
You're so beautiful.
Hey. I got you.
I'm not going home with you,
so don't even think about it.
Feel breath filling every
cell in your body.
This is our ritual.
We master our breath,
we master our mind.
Pulling the trigger
will become an unconscious effort.
You will be aware of it,
but not directing it.
And as you exhale,
find your natural respiratory pause...
...and the space between heartbeats.
TAYA :
Hey, this is Taya.
I can't get to the phone.
CHRIS:
So, yeah, I was thinking maybe
you didn't get that last message?
The last message I left
or the one before that?
- You figured what?
Good.
Not a lot. You?
KARNAN:
Aim small, miss small.
If you aim for a shirt button,
you might miss by two inches.
If you aim for a shirt,
you might miss by two feet.
You better close those groupings, Kyle.
Yes, sir.
TAYA:
Come on. Whoo!
Not bad.
- What do we get for that?
MAN: Top shelf.
I like that one. The brown one.
- Here you go.
- Great.
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sir. Have a good day.
Hello.
Good. That looks good on you.
So did you always want to be a soldier?
Oh. Uh, no, I wanted to be a cowboy, but...
I don't know. I did that.
I thought I was meant for something more.
So you started rescuing girls from bars?
- I think I rescued that bar from you.
- Ha, ha.
You like country music?
Only when I'm depressed.
How about kids. You want kids?
Yeah, someday.
My mom says I have a nose
for picking the wrong men.
Well, that's a shitty
thing to say to a girl.
Well, I've proven her right.
Them wrong picks put you here...
...made you who you are.
I like who you are.
You ever think about what happens when there's
a real person on the end of that gun?
I don't know. I just hope
I can do my job when that day comes.
Are we looking at the same target?
You're spitting dust.
And don't worry. We can always use
corpsmen for the guys who can't shoot.
Oh, fuck.
You're trembling.
I know it.
- We don't have to do this.
- No, I want to. I do.
- Yeah?
- You just feel real and it scares me.
You got your off-eye shut?
Well, if I close my off-eye
then I can't see what's out there.
- There's nothing out there but the target.
- Negative, sir. There is something out there.
Punch it.
Will pushups help?
Give me 50, Kyle. Clear and safe.
I'm better when it's breathing.
TAYA:
Oh, my God. Chris.
- What's wrong?
- No!
MAN :
You see the first plane coming in
from what looks like the east side.
And it goes into the building
with the flames...
...and the smoke billowing out
the other side of the tower.
It's hard for me to tell exactly which is
the north side and which is the south side.
It appears it's coming out
of the north side.
And then, moments ago,
these incredible images.
It almost looks like one of those
implosions of buildings that you see...
...except there is nothing controlled
about this. This is devastation.
You hardly even know me.
I know enough.
You are a package deal, babe.
What are you so afraid of?
Nothing.
Everything, I don't know.
What if it doesn't work out?
We're gonna get married
and then we're gonna start a family.
You got it all planned out, don't you?
I'm done.
I love you.
You're gonna need a ring if you
wanna talk all tough like that.
Okay.
MAN: Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. and Mrs. Chris Kyle!
- What the hell is on your neck?
- Hm?
Your neck. You got, like,
green paint all over you.
Would you believe me, babe,
if I told you...
...that I had an IV and I was
all green about two hours ago?
What?
CHRIS:
It's a package deal, babe.
Oh, my God.
Come here, you.
Cheers to that.
What's the word, chief?
Just got the call, boys.
It's on!
ALL:
Hooyah! Ha-ha-ha.
BIGGLES:
Shots!
Yeah! Whoo!
- Only six weeks, baby.
- I'm so afraid, baby.
That's what they say.
You got nothing to be afraid of.
It's all part of the plan.
Your heart is beating out of your chest.
That's just because I'm not the only
one who's going to war, that's all.
MARC: Welcome to Fallujah.
The new Wild West of the old Middle East.
AQl put a price on your heads, and now
extremists from around the globe...
...are flooding the
borders to collect on it.
You snipers, you're gonna be paired
with a Marine to watch your back...
...and inserted along the main road to do
overwatch for 1st Marines going door to door.
Your job is to protect those Marines
at all costs.
The city has been evacuated.
Any military-age male
who is still here...
...is here to kill you.
Let's bring these boys in safe
and get our asses back home.
SOLDIER:
Out of my truck! Out, out, out!
WINSTON:
I'd keep that head down, Tex.
Muj got snipers, too, you know.
A sniper won't aim for your head.
Man, they got this one sniper that's been
hitting headshots from 500 yards out.
They call him Mustafa.
He's in the Olympics.
They got sniping in the Olympics now?
Hold on, I got a woman and a kid,
Her arms aren't swinging.
She's carrying something.
She's got a grenade. She got a RKG
Russian grenade she just handed to the kid.
OFFICER:
You got eyes on this? Can you confirm?
Man, they fry you if you're wrong.
They send your ass to Leavenworth.
Fuck, that was gnarly.
Fucking evil bitch.
OFFICER 1:
OFFICER 2:
- Fuck, you hear that, man?
- Get the fuck off me.
CHRIS: Where is everybody?
- We're just picking our dicks.
- We're training those fucking Haji soldiers.
- Hey, why aren't you out there?
Well, I have the shits.
What...
...from reading a comic book?
It's a fucking graphic novel, man.
It's a big difference.
I heard you were on fucking fire out there.
Marc Lee came in,
said you popped your cherry.
Is that right?
There was a kid
who barely had any hair on his balls.
Mother gives him a grenade.
Sends him out there to kill Marines.
Dude, that was evil like
I never seen before.
Yeah, but, hey, man...
...you know that kid could've taken out,
like, ten fucking Marines, right?
- Yeah, but I killed him.
- You did your job.
That's the end of the story.
Yeah, it's just not how I envisioned
that first one to go down.
MARINE 1: Oh!
MARINE 2: Fuck, man.
What the hell?
That was your overwatch, Einstein.
You can thank him later.
Let's move!
Keep it going.
MARINE 3: Keep it going.
MARINE 4: Hurry up.
Contact! Front disperse!
MARC:
Cease fire!
Whoa.
MARINE 1: Eyes on the rooftop.
Keep your eyes up there.
MARINE 2:
Breacher up!
MARINE 3: Man down! Man down!
We need a corpsman over here now.
MARINE 4:
Approximate grid:
Quebec-Romeo-155604.
Smells like piss in here.
CHRIS:
Yeah, well...
MARC: You covered our asses out there,
man. Some ballsy shots.
CHRIS:
Uhn. Fuck. They were clean, right?
MARC:
Hell, yeah, they were.
Fucking sniper went right up our ass.
I already chewed out security detail.
Won't happen again.
It better not happen again.
There's a hot spot 400 meters out.
I'm gonna go write up
some shooter statements.
How many did you get?
I got six...
Well, that's not true. I got eight...
...but they dragged two off.
You got six?
- Yeah, why? What's wrong?
- Nothing.
You got more
than the rest of the snipers combined.
Yeah, but they got one of us.
You can't shoot what you can't see.
His wife said he was carrying a Koran.
Look, I don't know what
a Koran looks like...
...but I can tell you what he was carrying.
It was pressed metal, shot 7.62s,
and it looked just like an AK-47.
So you tell me what he was carrying.
BIGGLES:
Oh, here he comes.
Ladies and genitals, listen up!
We have a legend in our midst.
Round of applause for the legend.
There we go. We're so proud of you
back home on the range, boy.
Now, it's been said that the legend here...
...can kill 100 men with one blow.
Or, no, it was... No, fuck, what was it?
It was one blow from a single man.
He blew 100 men.
And he's single.
And so...
Goddamn it! Shit!
D:
Oh, shit!
BIGGLES:
Damn, man!
You want a food fight?
Come on. Shit.
Only way to shut you up.
TAYA :
CHRIS: That is not the way the call home
is supposed to go, babe.
Don't be weird with me.
Seriously.
I want you to tell me everything.
Well, there's certain things
you just can't say over the phone.
Okay, you knocked me up, right?
And I'm sitting here by myself,
literally assembling baby cribs...
...and you can't talk to me?
That's your big plan?
I can't stop thinking about that little
pink number you wore on our honeymoon.
Yeah, it's called a nightgown.
And three days?
Three days is not a honeymoon.
You know, it was a good three days.
I miss you real bad.
Hey, you want me to talk dirty to you?
But I got a phone in one hand
and a gun in the other...
...so I don't know what I'm gonna do.
Well, you're gonna have to decide
what's more important, baby.
You're horny preggers.
- Ha-ha-ha.
If you were 300 pounds, I'd still do you.
So romantic.
Nobody said it's a boy.
I can't wait to see
the way you're gonna be with him.
I just know.
I can sense it.
I hope you're right.
Hey, did your dad get ahold of you?
Shit.
Okay, you need to hang up
and call him, all right?
Fuck, I'm so selfish.
I wasn't even thinking.
Taya, what's wrong?
Your little brother deployed.
What? What happened to jump school?
No, he didn't get in.
You just hang up and call your dad, okay?
What do you mean? Deployed?
Where is he?
The man with the blade?
He's a Jordanian militant.
He's funded by bin Laden.
He's trained by bin Laden.
He is loyal to bin Laden.
His name...
...is Zarqawi.
Now this asshole...
...is right now the crown prince
of al-Qaeda in Iraq.
His mercenary army, AQl?
They're 5000 strong.
Now, these guys
are not your average shit-kickers.
These guys are well-trained,
they are well-paid...
...and right now, they are waging
the largest urban assault since Vietnam.
Zarqawi and his lieutenants,
these are our top priority.
Now, there is only one way
to root these guys out...
...and that is to go door to door,
house to house...
...until we find them or we find someone
who will give us their whereabouts.
So we are going to need to clear
ten structures an hour...
...which, I know, is a lot.
It's aggressive.
We're gonna be loosening things up
with air support.
This is the highest priority target
we have to date.
I want this asshole dead or captured.
Do you understand?
Are there any questions?
These Marines keep rushing in
like they're doing...
...they'll have their asses shot off.
- They're Marines.
They don't get the training we do. Half
these guys were civilians six months ago.
Let's coach them. I'll show them how Team
guys do it. I'll lead the unit on the street.
No, we can't do that.
We need you on overwatch.
Come on. If I'm on the street, Marc...
House to house is
the deadliest job here, man.
- You got some sort of savior complex?
- I want to get the bad guys.
If I can't see them, I can't shoot them.
All these guys? They know your name,
and they feel invincible with you up there.
- They're not.
- They are if they think they are.
Just keep banging on the long gun.
We'll let these dogs sniff out Zarqawi.
CHRIS: You said AQl has a sniper
in the Olympics...
...but Iraq hasn't qualified a shooter
in three games.
Well, that's because Mustafa's not Iraqi.
He's from Syria.
MARINE 1:
Breacher up!
Hey, once you all gain entry
I can't see shit...
...so take it slow
and move through your target.
GILLESPIE: Understood.
MARINE 1: Fire in the hole!
MARINE 2:
Man down!
You better back him down!
Oh, fuck this.
I'm gonna go clear houses with Marines.
- You coming?
- Fuck, no, I'm not coming.
No, man, I like my life.
I'd actually like to make it home alive.
It's not my job
to go fucking knocking down doors.
Those guys picked the wrong fucking job.
I'm not doing that shit.
All right.
Well, if I don't see you down there...
...you make sure I don't see you again.
- Hey. You all mind if I roll with you?
- Hey, man. Any SEAL is cool by me.
MARINE 1:
Breacher up!
You're the one they're calling the Legend.
You got 24 confirmed kills.
Well, who's counting?
That's fucking badass.
Yeah, I heard some motherfucker
in Bravo's catching up, yo.
I know y'all are meat-eaters,
but I know a couple things.
Simple shit I could show you. Maybe
keep us above ground. What do you say?
Yeah. All right.
THOMPSON:
Right on.
- Hey, what's that mean, bro?
- Breacher up.
MARINE 1:
Come on! Go!
CHRIS:
Moving.
Get down! Get down
on the ground right now!
Get your fucking ass down!
- No, no!
- He no understand!
GILLESPIE: Get down!
CHRIS: Why are you here?!
You're supposed to be evacuated.
Why are you still here?
I am Sheikh al-Obeidi!
- Sheikh alla-who?! Who the fuck are you?!
- This my home! I stay!
CHRIS: I don't give a fuck it's your home!
This is a war zone, sir!
- Sir, please!
CHRIS: Get that kid down!
Come on! Let's go! Move it!
- Found these bitches in the back closet.
- You are welcome here. You are my guest!
- How many more do you have here?!
- But tell the soldiers to come in.
SANCHEZ: This Haji just wants us
all in here so he can blow us up.
- If he see American, he know we speak.
CHRIS: Who?
- Please.
- Who says talking of us?
- Please come in.
- Who knows we're talking?!
Who?!
He come. He...
He very bad. Please.
- Target secure?
GILLESPIE: Target's secure.
Bring them in. Get your head down
on the ground. Hands behind your back.
- Now! Move now!
- Please, please.
CHRIS:
You gonna talk, we'll talk to you.
Bring him in the other room.
If he talks to U.S. soldiers,
they will come and make examples of them.
He? Who's he? Who's he?
The man who comes they call
"The Butcher." He's the despaired one.
Son of Shaytan, son of Devil.
Oh, he's like an enforcer?
- Yes, enforcer.
- Number one soldier Zarqawi.
Zarqawi? Yeah, we'd like to know
where Zarqawi is.
Do you know where he is?
You tell us where he is right now.
How can we get him?
CHRIS: You have information for us
about Zarqawi, tell us right now.
Find The Butcher, you find Zarqawi.
He reports to him.
Okay, well, how do we find him?
All right, look at me when I'm talking
to you. Where do we find him?
We must understand the risk to them,
but he will ask for money.
He need $100,000.
You need $100,000?
I have no proof this guy exists.
Fatima!
Hello.
- This is the proof.
- Look, I wanna help you out. I do.
But I need something. I need
phone numbers, address, names.
You have to give me something.
Sir! First platoon's pinned down.
Move out!
Sheikh, look at me when I'm talking to you.
Hey! Look at me!
I need something.
I can help you out, sheikh.
You give me a name,
and we will take care of it.
I can promise you that.
We will give you safety. Tell me right now!
- Emile Anafanoos?
- Amir Khalaf Fanus.
This is given name of The Butcher.
We believe that The Butcher's
Zarqawi's number two man.
This is your guy right here.
But you don't know his real name.
Otherwise, you'd have written it up there.
We got several aliases.
Now, if "Fanus" is legit...
...we'll go see the sheikh.
He's asking for 100,000.
Figures.
But if he delivers The Butcher,
he's gonna get it.
This is Agent Snead, DIA.
I need a name check
on an "Amir Khalaf Fanus."
Yeah, I'll wait.
If we're gonna go back out there,
Team 3 can pull security.
Won't happen. Head-shed will want
contractors if we're humping money.
Yeah, I'm here. What do you got?
All right. Okay.
Let's go see the sheikh.
Road kill.
You know The Butcher
is Zarqawi's enforcer?
They say his weapon of choice
is a fucking drill.
Went to seminary school
before I joined the Navy.
Was close to being a preacher.
And why didn't you?
I love to gamble, man.
I love those dice.
That's my kind of preacher.
It's like that now, huh?
Haven't you heard?
I'm the Legend.
Hey, babe.
You were right. The doctor says it's a boy.
What?
It's a boy!
It's a boy?!
- Hell, yeah, man. Congratulations!
- Ha-ha-ha.
Chris?!
Down! Grab the money! Get to the truck!
SOLDIER: Let's go! Let's go! Grab the bag!
Grab the bag!
Chris.
SNEAD: Go! Get the fuck out of here.
We'll come back for them.
Baby?
I heard one shot.
Check. Came in at an angle.
Be 300 or more yards out.
Oh, my God.
- You got a bead on him?
- I got Tango in the window.
Oh, shit.
I got eyes on The Butcher. He's got
the sheikh's kid on the avenue.
Requesting QRF.
We're being pinned down by sniper fire
on approach of high value target.
Grid 04536236. Over.
I'm gonna pop a smoke. I'm gonna secure
this building. I'm going to the roof.
Hold up!
Hold. Hold it.
Go!
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Come on, you fucking son of a bitch!
Fuck you!
GRONSKI:
You are one dumb son of a bitch,
you know that?
What the hell were you thinking?!
You completely failed
to secure the battlefield.
I'm shutting this whole thing down
pending an inquiry. Get back to base!
Hey, we gotta set up a squad
and pursue him.
Nope, they're shutting us down.
What do you mean?
Can't leave the wire till
they figure this shit out.
Well, he can't just leave us like that.
Hey!
I go home in three weeks!
Man, that's gonna be a long three weeks.
CHRIS:
Hey.
Hey, baby.
TAYA:
I thought you were dead.
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I thought you were dead.
I'm not. I'm right here.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
You're the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.
I have an alien growing inside me.
And there's a strange man in my bedroom.
It's our bedroom.
Your hands feel different.
Oh, no. They're my hands.
- Why am I so fucking nervous?
- Well, I am too.
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.
- You're lying.
- I swear.
How do I know some alien in there
is not gonna come out and grab me...
...in the middle of the night?
I'm gonna have to...
...choke him out.
It's gonna be okay.
- Promise?
- Yeah, of course.
Why're you so good with me?
TAYA: Hey, babe.
It might be nice to get out.
You listening to me?
- Chris.
- Huh?
What do you wanna do today, hon?
I thought we could just relax here.
Okay, we do that.
Let's relax.
CHRIS:
What are you doing?
TAYA:
Putting my foot on you.
Well, you know that's the way to my heart.
I'm coming over.
HALLERMAN: And that looks great.
TAYA: Oh, look.
Look. He's touching his nose.
- How are you feeling?
- I'm all right. I just want him out.
- I'm tired.
- It's gonna be any day now.
TAYA:
I hope so.
- How about you? How're you feeling?
- I'm feeling good. Thank you, ma'am.
I imagine it's hard to decompress.
Not really. No.
This is the first time
we've left the house.
I'm happy to be home. Yeah.
Here. Slip this on for me, would you?
Uh, I think if you wanna check anything out,
you may wanna check out these knees.
HALLERMAN: Are you a smoker?
- No, ma'am.
- You drink?
- Only when I'm thirsty.
HALLERMAN:
It's 170/110.
Jesus Christ, Chris.
Is that high?
Not if you've just had 14 cups of coffee.
But for someone who is sitting down, yes.
Oh, I appreciate you taking a look at that.
I'll look into it. Thank you.
Will you look into it?
Yeah.
You sabotaged me back there.
What am I supposed to do? You're not
talking. You act like it's all okay.
- It is okay. I'm fine.
- You're not fine, Chris, all right?
Your blood pressure is,
like, fucking 170/110.
Babe, I'm driving down the freeway.
It's sunny. It's 72 degrees. I'm fine.
There's a war going on. There's people
dying. No one's even talking about that.
It's like it's not even happening.
We're all on our cell phones...
...living our simple, simplistic lives.
It's not even on the news.
No one cares. There's a war going on,
I'm headed to the mall.
I'm not supposed to be here.
It's happening.
- What's wrong? You okay?
- It's happening.
Shit. Okay. I'm gonna go back.
- You're fucking crazy! You know that?
- It's okay. Hey! Shh. Baby, baby.
Oh, my God. Baby.
You look beautiful.
It's fucking happening.
Oh, my baby.
Hey.
Look at your mama.
- Hi.
- Hey, pal.
- Hey.
- Hey, baby-
Hey, little guy.
Hey, baby.
Hey, little guy.
Look what we did.
Look what we did.
Look what we made.
Look what we made.
The baby's crying.
I thought you were gonna get him.
No, don't bother turning it off.
I already watched it.
Had to make sure you didn't have an
Iraqi girlfriend sending you sexy videos.
That's a sniper recording his kills.
Mustafa.
He sells that shit on the street.
Those are American soldiers.
That day that we were on the phone,
was that him?
Was it?
Chris, just talk about it. You're not
protecting me by not talking about it.
No, I don't want you
getting that in your head.
- My imagination is so much worse.
- Oh, no, it's not. They're savages.
- Chris.
- Babe, they're fucking savages.
It's not about them.
It's about us.
What?
You have to make it back to us.
Okay?
Welcome home, chief.
Colonel Jones is waiting.
How was the flight?
- Longer than Christmas.
- I bet.
Hey. Can you wait a second?
All right. Hurry up.
CHRIS:
Hey, grunt!
Chris?
Hey, brother!
- Hi.
- Ha-ha-ha.
You all right?
You in one piece?
I heard you been kicking ass out here. All
the guys, that's what they've been saying.
That's what they say?
How you doing? You okay?
- Shoot, it's good to see you.
- You're my hero, bro.
Okay? You always have been.
Let's go, Kyle! Colonel's waiting.
The Legend, huh?
What happened?
You all right?
Man, I'm gonna miss my ride.
Hey, what happened?
I'm just tired, man.
I'm going home.
I'm proud of you.
Dad is too.
Dad's proud of you.
- Fuck this place.
- Huh?
What'd you say?
Fuck this place.
MARTIN:
Chief, we gotta move. Let's go!
JONES:
Thank you, sir.
Gronski's gone. A lot of top brass are.
Running off a new play book now.
I've studied insurgencies
for the last decade.
I know every stone thrown
since before the first century.
These wars are won and lost
in the minds of our enemy.
Yes, sir.
That you?
That's a Crusader cross. Yes, sir.
Yeah.
You're now the most wanted man in Iraq.
There's 180,000 on your head.
Congrats.
Well, don't tell my wife.
She might take that number right now.
Understand you wanna put together a
direct action squad to hunt The Butcher.
Yes, sir.
We got some intel
indicating his area of operations.
I want you to put the fear of God
into these savages...
...and find his ass.
Yes, sir.
CHRIS:
All right, let's go get this motherfucker.
- Gonna be a pop quiz before we leave.
- Small words next time, Big Legend.
- What'd you say?
- Small words next time
CHRIS:
I'll tell you those stories
if you want them.
BIGGLES: One hell of a PowerPoint, man.
- Oh, thanks, Biggles.
Always gotta say something, motherfucker.
That Bible of yours, is that bulletproof?
What, the one I put in here?
Yeah. I just never saw you open it.
I assumed...
God, country, family, right?
You got a God?
I got a God? You getting weird on me?
Growing up in Oregon, we had this
electric fence around our property.
Us kids would grab onto it
and see who could hold on the longest.
War feels kind of like that.
Puts lightning in your bones and makes it
hard to hold onto anything else.
Hey, man, you need to sit this one out?
I just wanna believe
in what we're doing here.
Oh, there's evil here. We've seen it.
Yeah. There's evil everywhere.
Oh, you want these motherfuckers
to come to San Diego or New York?
We're protecting more than just this dirt.
All right.
Let's go kill this fucker.
Bingo.
It's the building right here.
Any apartment on the east side
faces the restaurant.
In front of me, sir. Go, go, go.
CHRIS:
Clear.
Other door.
CHRIS: Get down on the ground.
Get down on the ground now.
- Put your hands behind your back.
- Okay.
D:
Target secure.
I got the window, Chris.
- Set security, boys.
BIGGLES: Get set up.
Corner.
CHRIS:
Let's move them in the other room.
Y'all ask if he knows him?
You recognize this guy?
INTERPRETER:
He says he does not.
CHRIS: How about you, son?
You recognize this face?
You sure?
All right, well, you make sure you tell them
they're not gonna go anywhere until we do.
Hey, you keep eyes on that window.
Make sure you take pictures
of anybody coming and going.
CHRIS:
What do we got?
MARC:
Sixteen military-age males have gone in.
CHRIS:
Sixteen?
Yeah, they serve more customers
than a fucking McDonald's.
Here, check this out.
CHRIS:
Is he still in there?
I clocked one point of entry.
He's in there, but it's not gonna be
an easy breach.
Oh, I don't know about that, man.
Probably see the Legend and just let him
right in, you know, big-time celebrity.
Ask him to sign their burka.
- Appear at their child's birthday parties.
- Ha-ha-ha.
Hey, what is your problem?
I didn't promote myself.
Yeah, no shit, motherfucker.
I did that for you.
You would've never made chief if I had
nicknamed you the fucking Myth or some shit.
He invites you to join him
for Eid al-Adha supper.
He says, on this day,
everyone has a seat at my table.
Oh, that's very generous of him.
BIGGLES:
That was, like, close, man.
TONY: Have some. Pretty good.
SQUIRREL: That's very nice.
TONY:
Take a cucumber.
Take cucumber
and put it in a tub with vinegar.
BIGGLES:
Yeah.
Stick in cayenne pepper,
add a lemon in it...
...and let it soak overnight.
BIGGLES: It's that, just add vodka.
That's the idea. You wanna get in on it?
TONY: Let's do it. I'm a ground-floor investor.
BIGGLES: All right.
CHRIS: Biggles, you never cooked
a day in your life.
Dude, that was the real question.
That was super real.
All these random people getting behind us.
CHRIS:
Get my father to fall in behind me.
D:
Holy shit.
D: Squirrel? You want some olives?
SQUIRREL: No, I don't do olives, man.
TONY: Somebody will get on that lamb head?
SQUIRREL: No, no.
TONY:
Come on, man. Get some brains!
I gotta wash my hands.
- It's good.
TONY: It's good?
D:
Hey, man.
This is good, man.
DAUBER:
Go check that out, Biggles.
- Stay right here!
BIGGLES: Wait.
SQUIRREL: What the fuck?!
DAUBER: Biggles, help me out here.
See that, muj? Huh?
You see that?
- What the fuck's going on?
- Bring the Terp in.
BIGGLES:
Oh, shit.
All right. Now you tell him that he's
gonna be sent off to detention...
...and the Iraqi courts can decide
what to do with him.
Or he can help us get inside
that restaurant downstairs.
You tell him. Say it's his choice.
DAUBER:
That's it.
MARC :
All clear.
Good, good. Moving.
CHRIS:
Assault team set.
BIGGLES:
Green-side security set.
Package is moving.
Fifteen meters out.
Ten meters.
Five meters.
He's knocking.
Hold.
They're vetting him.
Lights out, muj.
Execute. Execute.
D:
Frag out! Frag out!
Aah!
CHRIS: Anything coming out the back?
BIGGLES: Negative. No movement.
CHRIS:
Oh, shit.
- "D", take him down.
D: Got him.
CHRIS:
Get him down.
Oh, shit!
We found a tunnel. Watch your back.
Keep your eyes open.
BIGGLES:
Contact front!
Contact! Fall back!
MARC:
White-side, all security. White-side.
Butcher's on the move.
Repeat: Butcher's on the move,
I'm in pursuit.
Butcher's down. Moving your position.
I offered him detention.
It was his choice.
Picked the wrong side.
It's all there is to it. Fog of war.
Yo, Chris!
Fuck them, man. Let's go.
Shit's getting hairy.
Armed insurgents are moving this way.
We need to make tracks.
Good job here, chief.
CHRIS: Want another one or are you good?
- Look. What is this?
You get what it gives you.
That's how this thing works.
You don't get that one,
if that's the one you want.
COLTON:
I like that.
That's good. That's strong.
RECEPTIONIST: Chris, your truck's ready.
- You can move that all you want.
COLTON:
Your truck's ready. Impossible.
Give me your credit card.
Okay. Interesting.
CHRIS: I gave it to you?
RECEPTIONIST: Right.
- Pick it up off the floor.
- See if Chris Kyle's on file?
Off the floor.
Make sure you get all of them up.
Well, you got one back here.
Excuse me, sir?
Uh...
Are you Chief Chris Kyle?
Yes, sir.
My name is Mads. Um...
We met in Fallujah. You saved my life.
I did?
Yes, sir.
We were stuck in a house
until you came in with the 1st Marines.
You carried me out.
Oh, wow. Well, the Marines saved our
ass plenty of times.
- How are you? All right? You holding up?
- Great. Yeah.
I'm just grateful to be alive.
It hasn't been...
- It hasn't been easy.
CHRIS: Oh.
MADS:
Well, you know.
- A lot of guys lost more than just a leg.
- Mm-hm. Mm-hm.
Did you lose some friends?
Well, that too.
But I'm talking about the guys that lived.
You know, that made it back,
but they're just not back, you know?
- They can't seem to get right.
- Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Why don't you come down to the VA
sometime. The guys would love it.
They all know who the Legend is.
- Yeah, that sounds like a good idea.
- Hey, buddy.
Can I tell you something?
Your dad? He's a hero.
That's right.
He saved my life...
...and he helped me get back
to my little girl.
So thank you for lending him to us.
COLTON:
Okay.
I wouldn't be here without him.
My family thanks you for your service.
Okay, thank you. All right.
- Take care of yourself.
- It's great to see you again.
- Come down to the VA sometime.
- Okay. Yeah.
Grab your little lizard up there.
- Thank you.
RECEPTIONIST: You're welcome.
- Have a good day.
- You have a good day.
COLTON:
Goodbye.
CHRIS:
All right, let's go meet your sister, bubba.
Hey. Some help here?
My daughter's crying.
That's my daughter over there.
I think she's crying. Tend to her, please?
Excuse me.
Hey!
Hey, where you going?
Hey!
Hey, would you tend to my daughter,
please?
Hey!
Hey! Tend to my daughter, please!
Right now!
I'm making memories by myself.
I have no one to share them with.
Yeah, well, we got our
whole lives for that.
When does that start?
Even when you're here, you're not here.
I see you.
I feel you.
But you're not here.
I hate the Teams for it.
I do.
You're my husband.
You're the father of my children, but
they're the ones that pull you back.
Yeah, but, you see,
they can't wait and we can.
If you think this war isn't changing you,
you're wrong.
You can only circle the flame so long.
It's true.
Cadillac 31 actual, we're tailing The Butcher's
courier currently on Maryland Street. Over.
Hey! Got the ring.
From where?
From here?
Yeah, man. Fuck, yeah.
It's so much cheaper here.
Dude, you bought it from savages? How
do you know it's not a blood diamond?
What the fuck do you care, man?
You've spilled so much blood over here.
You're the Legend.
It's not for a rock.
Oh, what the fuck ever, man.
That's just hypocritical.
Hey, ease up on that.
Don't get too close.
Hey, did you tell her
where you bought it from?
Fuck no. I'm gonna tell her
I got that shit from Zales.
BIGGLES:
Just a half block back, baby.
We are wet and ready, Big Giggles.
You know, "D"...
...I predict in 20 years,
we're gonna have a reunion...
...you'll be married to a dude.
As long as you can cook and clean.
Now, there they are.
CHRIS:
Oh, shit.
Mustafa's got his peepers out.
BIGGLES: This motherfucker
is Keyser fucking Söze, bro.
Next time you get a clear shot,
you try not to miss him, all right?
Well, I would've gotten him in the alleyway
if I didn't have to save your ass.
So you gonna be my best man?
Just me? Or is it gonna be
everybody else too?
There's only gonna be one best man,
dude.
CHRIS:
Vehicle 1 taking fire.
- Come on, give me a shot.
BIGGLES: All right.
- Uhn!
CHRIS: Biggles, move.
Clear.
BIGGLES:
One on me.
SOLDER:
DAUBER:
Nope.
CHRIS:
Rooftop's secure.
Ahem. Aren't you worried that she's
gonna take that thing to Zales...
...find out how much you spent?
Well, no, I wasn't.
Set security.
- Now I'm a little worried about it.
- You should be.
What do you mean,
she can trace the diamond to Zales?
I don't think that's gonna...
You okay, buddy?
You're all right.
Got a man down.
Biggles is down.
Northwest corner.
Rooftop.
Hang in there, bud.
I need a corpsman right now!
Okay, bubba. We're gonna pick you up.
I'm gonna take you downstairs.
BIGGLES:
I can walk.
There we go.
Let's get him in the Humvee.
Taking off.
CHRIS:
I got him. I got him.
Get in. Hang in there, Biggles.
DAUBER:
Fuck.
Hang in there, Biggles.
CHRIS:
Hang in, Biggles.
- It's okay.
- Shit, I'm sorry, man.
For what?
What are you sorry for?
It's my fault we went on that roof.
Am I gonna die?
Fuck no, Biggles.
You're a fucking frogman.
Frogmen don't fucking die.
Gonna put some sand in this fucking cut,
get you a fucking canteen of water.
You're gonna be fucking fine.
Hang in there.
Hey, Chris. You make sure
she gets that ring, all right?
CHRIS:
Sure will.
MEDIC 1: Let's increase suction.
MEDIC 2: The retractor, please.
More blood.
MEDIC 1:
How long before we get film?
MEDIC 2:
We need another unit of blood.
MEDIC 3: Got that.
MEDIC 2: Saline, now.
MEDIC 1: More suction.
MEDIC 2: Hold your hand right here.
MEDIC 4:
Type and cross.
MEDIC 2:
Get it up. I need those numbers now.
Did you see where it came from?
It was more than 1000 meters out.
Only one enemy sniper
could've made that shot.
Will he make it?
Took a round off the feed tray cover
of his 48.
Doesn't look good.
That's the first SEAL hit, sir.
Fuck!
Shi'a cab driver we source is saying
there's a stronghold seven doors down.
Marine units covered your exfil
are still engaged there.
I can understand if you want
to stand down and regroup.
It's up to you.
MARC:
Eye for an eye.
We're going back out.
BOTH: Fucking-A.
- Fuck, yes.
Let's go.
It's on.
Hey!
MARC:
Two klicks out.
CHRIS:
Hallway clear.
On the left.
Bumpy.
Hallway.
Hallway clear. On the left.
Clear.
All clear.
All clear.
Hey, Marc.
Looks like someone left in a hurry. Huh?
TONY: Man down!
CHRIS: Contact window!
TONY:
Man down!
DAUBER:
Contact window!
CHRIS:
Contact window!
DAUBER:
Come on, Marc.
Let's go, buddy.
I got you, man. I got you.
Look at me. Look at me!
I got you.
Marc's gone, bro.
I got One Sierra down.
I need a CASEVAC immediately.
We gotta fucking move him.
WOMAN:
...and others find themselves
stumbling upon...
Either way, it is a noble
gesture that one...
...finds bestowed upon them.
My question is
when does glory fade away...
...and become the wrongful crusade?
Or an unjustified means...
...by which consumes one completely?
I've...
...seen war...
...and I've seen...
...death."
LEADER:
Detail. Ten-hut!

Marc wrote that letter two weeks ago.
Did he say any of that to you?
Chris, I wanna know
what you thought of his letter.
An AQl informant had called in a tip...
...and Biggles had just been shot.
We were operating out of emotion,
and we just walked right into an ambush.
But that's not what killed him.
That letter did.
That letter killed Marc.
I mean, he just let go,
and he paid the price for it.
Sign in here?
Hey, buddy.
- Hey, Chris?
- Yeah.
- Where you at?
- I'm right here. Right here.
- Oh, shit. You're blind as a bat.
- Yeah, it fucking blows.
- They say they're gonna fix my face, though.
- Oh, thank God.
About time.
Your face needs some fixing.
It's too soon, man.
It's too soon?
Way too soon.
Hey, I heard you proposed.
- Yeah.
- Well, good for you.
You didn't tell her
you bought that diamond...
- You told her you bought it at Zales, right?
- No.
- You didn't?
- No.
No, got a new one.
It's a smaller one.
Her dad helped me out with it.
Oh, nice.
- Oh, good.
- Mm-hm.
She wouldn't leave me, bro.
I told her to go, and she wouldn't leave.
She's getting a raw fucking deal.
Why would you say that?
Don't say that.
She's got you.
All two inches of you.
Two inches.
Yeah, you know, I'm glad
this happened to me and not you.
Ain't no way you could've handled it.
Yeah, you're probably right.
So they say you're the deadliest sniper
in U.S. military history.
Oh, is that right?
That's what I heard.
Them bad guys ended up in Sadr City.
You're not going back.
We are. We'll wall them in
and hunt them down.
- Come on. You don't have to do that.
- We have to do that.
You're my brother...
...and they're gonna fucking pay
for what they did to you.
Hooyah, Legend.
Fucking hooyah.
Something happens to me...
...you'd be all right.
You'd find someone else.
Do you wanna die?
Is that what it is?
No.
Then just tell me.
Tell me why you do it.
- Oh, come on.
- I wanna understand.
Babe, I do it for you.
I do it to protect you.
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.
I'm here. Your family is here.
Your children have no father.
- Yeah, well, I have to serve my country.
- Such fucking bullshit!
No, it's not.
You don't know when to quit.
You did your part. We've sacrificed enough.
You let somebody else go.
Let somebody else go?
- Babe, I couldn't live with myself if I did.
- Yeah, well, you find a way.
You have to.
Okay, I need you to be human again.
I need you here.
Baby, I need you here.
If you leave again...
...I don't think we'll be here
when you get back.
Come here.
Hey, Chris.
Oh, man.
We've been shot off position
three nights in a row, man.
Fallujah was bad. Ramadi was worse.
This shit is fucking biblical, Chris.
Is there any other Punishers here?
Squirrel cycled out.
And Dauber was coming back,
but his wife knocked him up.
And if I bring home another rug, my wife'll
murder my motherfucking ass, Chris.
- Teams and shit, right?
- Teams and shit.
Man, that Biggles news hit hard, man.
I went to see him in the hospital
before I left.
Motherfucker can't see shit.
Biggles is gone, Chris.
He was in surgery yesterday...
...and he died on that table.
TAYA :
I can't get to the phone,
so please leave a message.
CHRIS:
Don't pick it up.
Don't you fucking pick it up.
Son of a bitch.
Fucking drop it.
Drop it, you little cocksucker.
MARTIN:
The head-shed believe
this T-wall here will help...
...win the war by trapping
the remaining AQl behind it.
Problem is the engineers building
the thing are getting picked off...
...by a sniper from deep behind the wall.
- How deep?
Roughly 1000 meters.
- Is it Mustafa?
- Mu-who?
I don't know, dude.
Sniper who killed
our fucking friend, Biggles.
He can be whoever the fuck you need
him to be. We just need him dead.
We'll shuttle you six blocks north into
enemy territory which will put you...
...right under the sniper's nose
when he takes his shot.
In the middle of a fucking sandstorm?
Bring your fucking goggles, Bambi.
We need to shut this shooter down.
Understood? Gear up.
SOLDIERS:
Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.
CHRIS:
Clear.
We're maneuver. You're base.
Go.
Go!
CHRIS:
Clear.
Moving.
Go! Go!
All clear.
Set security.
The streets are crawling.
Hold your fire.
Enter the fucking sandman.
MAN 1: Stay down!
MAN 2: Sniper!
CHRIS:
Shit!
Shot came from the east!
We set up in the wrong fucking direction.
Doesn't matter.
Hold your fire.
We got uglies right below us.
I got something 1900 yards out.
Fuck, he can't even see that far out.
Hold your fire. You'll expose us all.
He's right, Legend.
Correction. It's 2100 yards out.
That's more than a mile.
Impossible shot, Chris.
It's him.
This is Task Unit Bruiser. I got eyes
on target. Initiate QRF. Over.
OFFICER: Copy that. ET on
Quick Reaction Force is 20 minutes out.
He has eyes on our guys.
Can you confirm it's him?
It's him.
Oh, it's him.
It's your call, Chris.
Quick Reaction Force is 20 minutes
out. You'll stand the fuck down!
If you got it, take it, man.
Aim small, miss small.
Do it for Biggles.
You just fucked us, Legend.
Tango down.
We need QRF ASAP!
Mission accomplished.
He had eyes on our guys.
Yeah. And now we're fucked
like a football bat!
Biggles would be proud.
You did it, Chris.
OFFICER: Echo 7 Kilo, be advised you have
enemy approaching all directions of your pos.
RANGER:
White-side! Goddamn it, Legend. Fuck!
D:
Yeah, let's go. Come on.
All right, I see two ways up on the roof.
Now, we wanna lock both staircases.
Get some, motherfuckers.
OFFICER: Echo 7 Kilo, you have
Tango-heavy gun on your green-side.
RANGER:
Oh... Whew.
"D", I'm down to two mags. We gotta move!
Don't stop fucking shooting, man!
QRF's stuck three blocks out.
DELTA SNIPER: I'm out!
- 3 o'clock. Loading last mag.
SOLDER:
RANGER:
GUNNER:
D: We can't hold them any longer!
We gotta move!
MARTIN:
Those guys are sitting ducks.
- I don't wanna get dragged in the street.
- That's it. Do it.
Call it in.
This is Rio 2 Bravo
requesting ordnance drop.
Grid number 04837959.
OFFICER: That target location is your position.
- I know my fucking position.
- They're right on top of us. Just drop it!
- Viper 34, move to final attack heading.
Viper 34. Roger.
Thirty seconds out.
TAYA :
Baby?
Baby, I ca... Baby, I can't hear you.
Hello?
I'm ready.
I'm ready to come home.
I have the building in sight.
I'm ready to come home, baby.
Chris?
Pretty bad air up here.
Tell the pilot "turn it loose."
OFFICER:
Shit.
RANGER:
We need to exfil now!
Let's go! Let's move!
RANGER:
We gotta move!
OFFICER: Echo 7 Kilo,
green-side is clear for exit.
CHRIS:
I got the out. Green-side pole on my go!
RANGER:
Down the roof!
Let's go!
CHRIS:
Last man!
RANGER:
Get to the trucks!
RECON SNIPER:
Go! Go! Go!
RANGER:
Come on! Inside!
SOLDIER 1: That's one!
SOLDIER 2: Get in now! Gotta go!
Come on! We gotta go! Now!
D:
Shit! Let me on!
Come on. Let me on.
- Where's Chris?
RANGER: What?
D: He was just behind me.
Where is Chris, man?
Open the fucking door!
Stop the goddamn rig!
RANGER:
Chris, come on!
SOLDIER 1:
Come on, you squid!
D: We can't leave you! Come on, Chris!
Grab my hand!
SOLDIER 2:
Grab his hand, "D"! Come on!
SOLDIER 1:
Pull him in now!
We gotta go! Now!
D:
Come on, Legend! Get in here!
Come on, Chris! Pull!
Yeah?
TAYA :
I just got this weird message that
you were on a plane or something?
You did?
So, what, are you in Germany, or...?
Where?
No, I'm here.
I'm stateside.
You're home?
What are you doing?
I guess I just needed a minute.
Chris, the kids are dying to see you.
It's been nine months. What...?
I'm coming home.
Yeah, I'm good.
Babe, come home. Okay?
You know, we miss you.
Okay.
TAYA:
Hey, Chris?
Babe.
Hon, I'm going outside.
- Get it!
GIRL: Higher.
TAYA: Look at you.
I can see your face again, babe.
- Looks good.
- Well, good.
Looks different.
So the game's this Saturday.
You know, he's the tallest kid on the team.
Doctor said he could be 6'4".
- Isn't that insane?
- Mm.
Can't wait for you to see him play. I go
crazy when the other kids jump on him.
I need you there as, like,
a leveler, you know what I mean?
Hey, maybe you could even coach,
you know?
'Kenna's gonna lose that tooth.
I'm so worried she's gonna swallow it,
like, in her sleep or something.
And she said she'd let you pull it,
but only you. Would you do that?
TAYA:
Chris!
DOCTOR: You know, I got a very interesting
phone call. It's from your wife.
She told me about the barbecue.
Yeah, that was unfortunate. Yeah.
Things seem like they got
a little out of hand. Are you worried?
No, sir.
So you're not worried about what
happened, or what might happen?
No, sir, I'm not worried about that.
Let me ask you a question, Chris.
How much time did you spend in-country?
Uh, well, four tours, so...
That's like, what, 1000 days?
Yeah, sounds about right.
Would you be surprised if I told you
that the Navy has credited you...
...with over 160 kills?
- Mm.
Do you ever think...
...that you might have seen things or done
things over there that you wish you hadn't?
Oh, that's not me. No.
What's not you?
I was just protecting my guys.
They were trying to kill our soldiers...
...and I'm willing to meet my Creator
and answer for every shot that I took.
The thing...
...that haunts me are all the guys
that I couldn't save.
You know, I'm willing and able
to be there but I'm not. I'm here. I quit.
So you wish you could've
saved more guys?
Yes, sir.
You know, you can walk down any hall
in this hospital.
We got plenty of soldiers need saving.
Mm-hm.
Wanna take a walk?
Sure.
All right.
I wanna show you something.
I still smoke, but can't be too mad at it
because it kind of saved my right hand.
CHRIS:
How so?
When I got blown up, I had both of my
hands on the bottom of the steering wheel.
And right before the explosion went off,
I took my hand off...
...grabbed a cigarette,
stuck it in my mouth.
When I went to go light it,
the explosion happened.
And it took the whole bottom of the
steering wheel and my left hand off.
And I was lucky that I had this.
I mean, it still fucked up my right hand,
but...
CHRIS: Yeah.
- I still got it.
CHRIS:
And you still smoke?
Yeah, I still smoke.
Miss. Three inches to the right.
Come on, Wynn.
You can do better than that.
CHRIS:
Bring this to the right.
Make sure you keep both eyes open.
Let that trigger surprise you.
We're not shooting bad guys,
we're shooting paper.
How about the Legend stops
trying to fuck up my shot?
How about you hit one?
- Hit!
CHRIS: There you go.
Bull's-eye, boy.
Damn, if that don't feel like
I got my balls back.
Why you spending
all this time with us, man?
I know you got a family.
I heard you had a boot collection
before the war?
I saw we were about the same size.
Seriously, man.
Why do you do it?
Well, we take care of each other, right?
Let's see if you can't hit two in a row.
Come on, man. You got this.
- Hit!
- Nice.
- Hit!
- Whoo!
Goddamn.
Who's the legend now?
That's a title you don't want.
Trust me.
CHRIS: Yo, will you hop down?
I'll give them to you.
- You got one more?
- Yeah.
- All right, take them inside.
- All right.
CHRIS:
Come here. Tsk, tsk, tsk.
It's not a bad life out here, is it?
Got a smile on his face.
Looks cheery to me.
Just doing his thing.
Wave goodbye to him.
CHRIS:
Oh! Fuck, who is that?!
Oh, babe, is that you?
Yep-a-doo-dee!
Baby, I fucking hurt myself. Shit.
- What?
- No, I'm all right. I'm all right!
I'm all right. Fuck.
- Baby, I'm sorry.
- It's okay.
What happened?
Don't you...! Ooh!
CHRIS: You know that it's a heck of thing
to stop a beating heart.
COLTON:
Yeah.
That's why we're gonna do it together
for your first time.
All right.
Now remember, you gotta be calm...
...confident...
...and you never hesitate.
All right.
- You got it, bubba?
- I got it.
- You feel good?
- Yeah.
- Shh.
- Shh.
Hands in the air, little lady.
- No way.
- Hands in the air.
Now, you drop them drawers.
But you drop them nice and easy.
Oh, baby, look at you.
Look at you.
Can I tell you something, Chris?
- Tell it to the judge.
- Stop it.
No, I am so proud of you,
and I don't tell you enough.
I'm so proud of you.
You're such a great father.
And I am so happy
that I've got my husband back.
And I also know how hard you fought
to get here.
You're worth fighting for.
Now tell me one other thing.
- Did you pleat those jeans?
- Hm?
Yes, ma'am.
I believe they're right down the middle.
- Oh, you're just a regular, old cowboy again.
- Mm-hm. That's right. And...
- Why don't you really drop them drawers.
- I'm not wearing any drawers, baby.
I got four minutes.
Ha-ha-ha.
Is that all it takes?
No, it takes two minutes.
But then I want two minutes to look at you.
Aren't you going to the range?
Who are you taking out?
This Marine.
His mama kept asking me.
She parks cars at the elementary school,
and she said, "Can you help out my son?"
And I just thought today's the only day
I can really do it, so...
It'll be just a bit of the afternoon.
I'll be back.
COLTON:
Yes! Ha-ha-ha.
Make sure you keep them drawers...
What's up?
- Dad, you wanna play "Skylanders"?
- No, I can't play right now.
I'll do it when I get back, boy.
See you're on Level 8, and that
doesn't work. I gotta be on Level 4.
I wanna win.
You gotta let me win.
COLTON:
No way!
McKENNA: Poke the bear!
- Poke the what?
- Poke the bear!
- Poke the what?!
Poke the bear!
- No! You're supposed to roar, like, grr!
- Like what?
- Grr!
- Like a beast, right? Like what?
Ooh. All right, bubba.
- Y'all look after our women, okay?
- Yeah.
Okay. It's a big responsibility.
You up for it?
All right. See you later, baby.
- I love you.
- Love you back.
CHRIS: How are you? You good?
- Good.
We're gonna go about a two-hour drive...
...shoot some guns, maybe have
a little conversation along the way.
All right. Let's go.
Thank you.
