Bull's-eye.
- It's dead as a doornail around here.
- Yeah.
How about seeing a picture, Rocky?
There's one at the Academy on 14th.
- Yeah, what?
- Covered Wagon. It's new, just come out.
- You got any dough?
- No. You got any?
No.
Oh, look. There's Rocky Sullivan.
Walk right by him like we don't see him.
Hey, Rocky, there's Laury Martin coming.
So what?
Oh, my books, they're coming loose.
Say, that ain't a bad-looking doll,
that one in the middle.
- The one with the pretzel legs.
- He means you, Laury.
- Why, the fresh...
- Don't be so smart-alecky, Rocky Sullivan.
- Go on. Beat it, pigtails.
- Trying to show off, ain't you?
- Scram, before I wipe the street with you.
- You better wipe your nose first.
- Is that so? I'll fix you.
- You better scram. You know the Rocky.
- Come on.
- Leave me alone, I can handle him.
Wait till I get down there. I'll fix you.
- I'll slap you down.
- Oh! Why, you, you...
Shut up.
Come on. Let's get out of here,
dig up some corn.
You won't get away with that, Rocky.
I'll get even someday. You just wait.
Say, maybe this winter we can
hop a freight to Florida.
They say you can go swimming there,
even in January.
Sure, we can even hop one to California
if we wanted to.
Look here, "Rubelin Coal Company,
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania."
It's too bad it ain't winter. We could
grab a couple bags of those coals.
"Everwrite Fountain Pen Company."
I wonder what's in there.
Come on. Let's take a look.
It's loaded full of cases.
Fountain pens. Hundreds of them.
- We can break that easy.
- We shouldn't, we don't need those pens.
- It ain't like stealing coal to keep warm.
- We can sell them.
Now, listen.
What we don't take, we ain't got.
Look around. See what you can find
to break that lock.
All right, whoever's in here,
come on out.
Come on out, I say!
- What's the trouble?
- Just a couple of kids. I heard them.
Come on out of there.
Come on, you hoodlums.
You won't get away.
- Come out, or I'll come in after you.
- Let's make a break for it, Jerry, now.
Come on, Rocky! Jump!
Hi, Snowflakes.
- Hi, Jerry.
- Hello.
What do you hear? What do you say?
Sit down.
- How they treating you, Rocky?
- Like a prince.
I get three square meals and real butter
on my bread. What a life.
- Is that a bad cut on your eye?
- Not bad. Just a few stitches.
I thought you knocked your eye out.
You coming to my trial tomorrow?
Rocky, I've been worrying about
this all last night.
- I can't let you take the whole blame.
- Pipe down, want the flapper to hear?
Now get this. You got away, didn't you?
Okay. I wanna be a sucker.
But, Rocky, maybe if they thought
I was in on it, they'd go easier on you.
In a pig's eye. Just because you can run
faster, you don't gotta eat yourself.
- But it ain't fair to you, Rocky.
- Look, so they send me up. So what?
What've I got to lose? The old man's
got troubles enough without me. Forget it.
I got caught, and you got away.
But you, Rocky. Supposing I was the one
who got caught, you wouldn't keep quiet.
- You'd make them send you up too.
- What do you think I am?
- I'd lay dead just like you're gonna do.
- You would?
Sure. Always remember, don't be a sucker.
I'm pulling every string I can.
I'm seeing the right people.
- I can get you off with about three years.
- You talk like I can do it in a handstand.
That ain't no picnic. You'll be outside
having it soft on cushions.
It's tough. I'm not gonna mark time.
I'll scout around, make connections.
- Not only for me, for both of us.
- Why should I take the fall?
There's no other way out. Be sensible.
If they get me, I'll be disbarred. They'll
check my vault box and grab the 100 grand.
You don't want to lose that dough,
do you?
All right, Frazier.
It's my rap, and I'll take it...
...but it's my 100 grand, and I'll take
that, too, the day I get out. Look...
I know you're a smart lawyer,
very smart...
...but don't get smart with me.
Very good, boys. That's all.
Wait till I get you outside, mug-face.
I'll immobilize you.
Yeah? You and your old maid!
Come in.
What's on your mind, son?
Not very much, Father. It's just been
bothering me for 15 years.
What did you do with those fountain pens
you stole?
- Rocky! You old...
- Jerry, glad to see you.
- What do you hear? What do you say?
- I'm glad to see you.
Good to see you.
Fifteen years.
Hasn't changed a bit.
- You remember Father Boyle's old sacristy.
- Remember it?
He used to stand right where you are
and boil the tar out of me.
Gosh, 15 years. It doesn't seem possible
I haven't seen you in that length of time.
- I've seen you.
- You have? Where?
I was there when you made
the 90-yard run against NYU.
- Why didn't you come back and see me?
- Some people were waiting for me.
- Oh. Well, I got a kick coming, though.
- You have? What?
- Why haven't you written to me?
- You know how it is, Jerry.
I changed my address and number
so often, you had no way to answer me.
You know what happens to letters
written in the stir. Everybody reads them.
When I was inside, nothing happened.
When I was out...
...it was all there to read
on the front page.
Yes, I read all the papers.
- You certainly make a good-looking priest.
- Thanks.
Your mother always wanted you to do it,
but what finally decided you?
Well, I was riding along on the top
of a bus...
...looking down, passing the cathedral.
- That gave you the idea, huh?
That's funny, I got an idea on the top
of a bus once. Got me six years.
I was around while you were
singing with the kids...
...and I kept thinking of you and me
- With Father Boyle.
- Yeah.
Remember slipping "Merry Oldsmobile"
into the hymnbook?
- How could I forget it?
- How'd it go?
Lead, kindly light
Amid the encircling gloom
Lead thou me on, for the night is dark
And I am far from...
- Did a lot of crazy things in those days.
- Certainly did. Certainly did.
Come in.
Father, you're supposed to be down at
the store. The fellas are waiting for you.
You run and tell them I'll be right over.
Tell them to get the game started.
- Okay, Father!
- All right.
What's this store racket?
Got the kids shilling for the parish?
That's not a bad idea, Rocky.
No. It's a pet scheme of mine.
- A recreation spot for the kids.
- Kind of a kindergarten place, huh?
No, it's for the big fellas too.
You'd be surprised how tremendously it's
helped to keep the kids from becoming...
Hoodlums like me?
- You've cost me a lot of prayer.
- I've been in kind of a retreat myself.
- Yes. Will you be here for some time?
- Depends. I got a little business to attend.
- I gotta find a place to live.
- Get a room here in the parish.
- Not a bad idea. No place like home.
- Yes, and it's great to have you home.
- I came back to take a look at your kisser.
- Stick around and take a lot of them.
This is Maggione's. Go in and get a
furnished room. Remember her, don't you?
Took a lot of good lead pipe
out of that cellar.
Church is just around the corner.
I can drop in to see you from time to time.
- See you at Mass Sunday?
- Sure. I'll help you with your collection.
- It's a deal.
- Fair enough.
- Mrs. Maggione at home?
- What do you want?
Looking for a room.
My mother ain't here, but the lady
in number two will show you the rooms.
Yes?
Yes?
I'm looking for a room. Mrs. Maggione's
kid told me you'd take care of that.
Yes. I'll get the key.
Third floor.
There's something about your face
that looks awfully familiar.
- You've been looking at the funny papers.
- No, really.
Listen, sister, all I'm looking for
is a room.
Here it is.
Mrs. Maggione will give it
a good cleaning.
- It's all right. I've seen worse.
- I guess you have.
- I'll take the room. What's the tariff?
- Five dollars a week.
- Sold.
- In advance.
All right.
Write me a receipt.
You can trust me.
How did you happen to come
to this house?
Looking for references, huh?
An old friend of mine sent me over here.
Jerry Connolly, the priest from the parish.
- You know him?
- Father Jerry?
Yeah. Does that send me in?
Oh, I get it now. You're Rocky Sullivan.
- Yeah.
- Remember me?
- No.
- Laury Martin?
Laury Martin? That little fresh kid
with the pigtails?
Well, hello. What do you hear?
What do you say?
Hello.
- Hey! Wait a minute!
- I've waited 15 years to do that!
I wanna see Jim Frazier.
- I wanna see Frazier.
- He's busy.
- I'll wait.
- Who are you?
- Rocky Sullivan.
- Oh. Come on.
Number one. Clear the board.
Wait here.
- There's somebody to see you.
- Yeah? Who?
Rocky Sullivan.
- Rocky Sullivan?
- Yeah.
- Does he know I'm here?
- Sure. Didn't you want me to tell him?
That's all right. Send him in.
Well, well, Rocky! This is a surprise.
- What do you hear? What do you say?
- I had the date on the calendar.
I thought it was next month. Otherwise
I would've met you with a brass band.
I thought it was funny you didn't show,
but you've been busy the last three years.
You got a swell layout here.
Looks like you're in the dough.
- Yes, only... Well, you know Mac Keefer.
- Mac Keefer? Yeah, heard of him.
- He owns the town. Can buy and sell it.
- Only he doesn't buy it. He sells it.
- That's soft, eh?
- Softer than that store cot...
...I've been sleeping on
for the last three years.
- Well, you're out now, Rocky.
- Yeah.
- Where's that dough?
- What? The hundred grand?
I had it for you, only as I said,
I didn't expect...
- I know. You said it before.
- You don't have to worry about it.
- I'm not worried.
- I'll have it by the end of the week.
In the meantime, I suppose you'd like
some spending money. Here, here's 500.
I'll take that. It'll take me
a few days to get settled.
By that time, you can get that dough
together and tell me where I come in.
Where you come in? What do you mean?
What business you want me to handle,
what parts of town and what my cut is.
- Your cut?
- Yeah. That was the idea, wasn't it?
I took the rap, three years. You took
the dough, made connections, built it up.
For you and me. Wasn't that it?
Oh, I see. Yes. I understand...
...but you've got this thing all wrong.
See, I work for Keefer. He's the boss.
I haven't anything to say.
If you want a spot in his business, why...
...you'll have to take it up with him.
Now, look, Frazier, I'm not taking it up
with anybody but you.
You figure it out for yourself.
I'm taking up with you where I left off.
That was the agreement,
and we're going to stick to it. Got it?
- Well, yes, but...
- But what?
Well...
- Hello, Mac.
- Am I breaking in on anything here, Jim?
No, not at all. Come right in.
I want you to meet Rocky Sullivan.
Pleased to meet you, Sullivan.
I know all about you. You're okay.
- When did you get out?
- Couple days ago.
- What are you doing?
- Looking around.
- Maybe I might have a spot for you.
- We were just talking about that.
- Where you stopping?
- A room at my old neighborhood...
...on Dock Street, number 24.
Well, I'll blow now.
I'll drop up, say, Monday?
- Monday? That'll be fine.
- I'm going downtown. I'll give you a lift.
- Thanks.
- See you later, Jim.
Monday.
Get me Steve.
There's a fella leaving with Mac.
I want you to...
Yeah?
Yeah, I got a good look.
Yeah, yeah. I got it.
Sure, I'll take care of him.
Out of the way, blubberhead.
The famine is on.
Guys, want some cigarettes?
All you guys can have cigarettes off me.
You better pack them now, boys.
Here comes the beef trust.
How do you do?
- A nickel you don't conk him.
- All right, a nickel I do.
- You missed him, chump.
- Yeah. A nickel apiece you owe.
That cop don't walk right or something.
- Those cops are so dumb, it's pathetic.
- You'd think they'd learn where...
...a tomato comes from in police college.
Look.
Hello, toots. You want the bottle?
You want the bottle? Oh, nuts.
Hey! What are you doing with my baby?
"Hey! What are you doing with my baby?"
Here's your baby!
- You loafer! I'll get the cops after you!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
The way he talks, you'd think
he had something there.
Excuse me.
Hey. Look at the dude.
- Come on. Let's give him the works.
- All right, kiddo.
- Hey, watch out!
- Give me that!
I'll make you eat that ball in a minute!
All right, come on! Let's go!
Like taking candy from a baby.
How'd you get it, Crab?
I hoisted it over the transom
in the alley and dropped it.
- The corner caught me right in the dome.
- So long as it didn't break the machine.
Boy, we'll be in the money now.
Six nickels and two slugs.
Imagine crooks like that?
Putting slugs in a slot machine.
- Chiselers.
- I'm gonna break this thing...
Pipe down.
- It's only Soapy and the gang.
- That's good.
Hi, Soapy!
- Soapy, look what we got.
- You should see the hook I got.
It's the most I got in my life.
- We got a sucker's poke.
- No kidding!
- Come on. Dish it out. Time's a-wasting.
- What's the matter, crabbing already?
- Give me air! Give me air!
- How much you got there, Soapy?
- Let me see. Ten, 20, 30, 35...
- Gee! There must be more than 100 there!
- A hundred nothing. We're in the big chips.
- Wow, what a haul!
"Wow, what a haul!"
- Six ways! Don't forget, six ways!
- You'll get yours.
- What, are you grabbing already?
- Come on. Come on. Give me, Soapy.
- Oh, that looks nice.
- Oh, my!
We split half, all right?
- Hey, I didn't get mine!
- You bunch of chiselers!
Stick them up!
You're all covered.
Give us a break, mister.
We wasn't there.
We had nothing to do with it.
- Say your prayers, mugs.
- On the level, mister!
Shut up, rats!
Stop your squealing.
- Who's the leader?
- I am.
Come here.
Collect that dough, and fast.
Come on. Hand it over.
You too. Come on.
Here.
Now get them up and turn around.
- Hey!
- Hey! What's the matter?
Next time you roll a guy for his poke,
make sure he don't know your hideout.
How did you know?
Come here, suckers.
- How do you know this place so good?
- Yeah, how do you know?
Let me show you. Here.
Look at this.
- "R.S."?
- Hey, you ain't Rocky Sullivan!
Rocky Sullivan!
Hey, did you get that?
It's Rocky Sullivan!
We tried to hook you! What a boner!
When you saw us duck down the alley...
...you knew we was headed to the hideout.
- I took the old shortcut.
- What do they call you?
- Soapy's the name. He's Bim.
This mug here's Swing.
This palooka up here's Hunky.
- Hi, Rocky.
- And I'm Pasty, and this guy's Crabface.
- We just call him Crab for short.
- Hi.
Glad to meet you, Rocky.
Fellas, meet Rocky Sullivan, headliner!
- Hi, Rocky!
- Hiya, Rocky!
Good to see you!
Hey, Rocky.
Hey, you took the room above us,
number 24, didn't you?
- Yeah.
- Sure, sure. We knew.
- You knew when you rolled me?
- Certainly. Johnny Maggione told us.
- He didn't tell us who you was.
- You shouldn't have taken a chance.
Never bother anybody in your own
neighborhood. You got a lot to learn.
You ought to be able to learn us, Rocky.
Now, look, how would you like
to have a bite with me?
Here's a fin. Go to the deli
and get some sandwiches and pickles...
...and some beer. Bring them over
to my place. We'll have a feed.
I'm not in a bread line.
Will you give me some beans?
- All right, all right, all right.
- I'm on no hunger strike.
- Give out with this Irish caviar.
- Come on. A little more, you stingy grubber.
- Give me some pickles.
- You don't want any pickles.
- Sure, I want pickles.
- You like pickles? Take them.
Boy! Pickles!
- What are you doing? Going into business?
- No. Souvenirs. Free.
Here, Rocky. Here's your change.
- Where's the other 50 cents?
- We had to buy something, didn't we?
You guys got an awful lot to learn.
Chuck your chest up to the wood.
- These beans are rotten.
- Oh. You don't like the beans?
No!
Hey, these beans taste soapy.
But good! Very good.
Come in.
- Hello, Jerry.
- Hello, Rocky.
What do you hear? What do you say?
Having a little bite to eat with the kids.
- Sit in?
- Sure, why not?
- Right here.
- Thanks.
- How about a sandwich?
- All right.
Thanks, Swing.
It didn't take long to get
acquainted with Rocky, did it?
Hey, Rock, looks like you
and the Father are old pals.
Look, next time you get
down to the hideout...
...look at that old door. You'll see right
next to my initials, "J.C." Jerry Connolly.
Father used to hang with
Rocky at the old boiler room?
Certainly. We spend most of our
time at the gym now, Rocky.
Oh, yeah?
Boys, I hoped to start
that basketball game today.
- We're too busy. Too busy.
- Hey, give me a sandwich, will you?
What's the matter, Soapy? Why don't
you want to go to the basketball game?
- It ought to be fun.
- You think we're a bunch of cream puffs?
Hey, imagine us playing
basketball all of a sudden.
Oh, yeah? Well, I'll tell you what.
I'll tell you what.
I'll bet a buck to a nickel you can't
get the ball past the other team.
- And I haven't even seen them.
- We'll run them into the ground.
- You'll come with us, Rocky?
- Yeah, is it a bet?
- I got a nickel. It's a bet.
- Split the winnings.
- We have to practice first.
- The gym is open, you can go now...
...if you like, go ahead.
Goodbye, Father.
I've been working on them
for a year. Can't get anyplace.
You talk for 10 minutes, they'd
jump through a hoop if you asked.
Maybe it's because
I wear my collar frontwards.
As long as you're sponsoring the gym,
let's go and take a look at it.
- You mean now?
- Sure. Come on, I want to show you.
- You remember old Krausmeyer's store.
- Yeah, sure. We used to rob it.
I've been trailing him, but he's
mixed up with a priest and kids...
...and I can't get a crack at him.
- Don't let him out of your sight.
I'll send Bugs down with a couple boys.
Come on, fellas. Let's wipe up
the floor with these kids!
The kids play a swell game.
Keep a good eye on them.
Keep your chin covered.
All right, boys, clear the floor!
Take the mats off! Line up.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Friends?
- Okay.
What have you been doing,
playing a duck for me?
- I wasn't gonna hurt you.
- No, I forgot you were in the neighborhood.
Well, what are you doing?
Same thing you're doing,
watching the game.
Say, you turned out to be
a pretty snappy-looking dish.
- Thanks.
- For a sociable worker.
- Thanks again.
- I can't figure out why some smart guy...
...hasn't grabbed you off.
- Some smart guy always in the headlines?
You could do worse.
You know better than that.
Wait till I blow the whistle.
Okay, let's get going.
- What happened?
- Here you are. Right here.
Ready?
Run! Run!
- Free throw!
- That's not fair. He didn't do nothing.
That's it.
- Come on! Take it down!
- I got my man!
You do that again,
you're out of the game.
- I didn't do nothing. He's screwy.
- Give us a break.
- What's the matter?
- Can't even shove a guy in this game?
What do you mean, shove a guy?
It's a free throw. Gibby, take it.
That's not fair!
- Hey, dribble that ball and pass it.
- Dribble that.
Foul!
That big bozo just stuck his belly out.
You boys know better than that. You
committed technical and personal fouls.
Stop it. You've got six men on the floor.
Pasty, get off the floor.
- Somebody take care of that trapeze.
- Just me good deed for today.
All right. Red out.
Here. Watch this.
- Make a few notes.
- All right, boys!
Mr. Sullivan's gonna referee.
- Don't forget about that bet.
- Go on.
- Get off the floor!
- What am I, an orphan?
Now! Get going! All right.
- Don't forget. According to rules.
- Yeah.
- Throw it to me.
- Here we go.
What's the matter with you?
Don't raise your hand to me.
Get in here. Play ball.
Ready? Position, now. Here we go.
Wait for the whistle.
What's going on here?
- Rocky sure handles those kids, doesn't he?
- Yes...
...but don't you think it's a bit
like playing with dynamite?
Why do you say that, Laury?
Look, Father, just because you've got
me seeing things straight now...
...there's no reason I should wear blinders.
I still remember what Rocky's kind is like.
I don't know.
Somehow, I feel that Rocky
could be straightened out.
Get up!
- Come on! Let's go!
- Break it up!
Foul!
All right!
Come on! Sullivan,
what are you doing?
Foul!
Foul ball!
- Wait for the whistle, you understand?
- Let's go.
- What's the idea?
- He didn't do nothing.
What's the idea?
I'm asking you. Play according to the rules,
or I'll slap sense into you.
- I didn't do nothing!
- Well, don't do it again. Give me that ball.
Here we go.
Where you running?
Personal foul.
Free throw over here.
I didn't do nothing.
- Foul!
- Foul? What did he do, hit me?
Foul. Our ball over here.
- Get him!
- Give me that ball!
Give me that ball.
Rocky, what are you doing,
playing for the other team?
Now, are you guys going to play
according to the rules or not?
Okay, Rocky.
According to the rules, fellas. Got me?
We'll beat them!
Thirty-two to 8. Boy, what a slaughter.
What do you mean, 32 to 8?
It was a close game.
- Yeah! You just won by a nose.
- All you guys, shower down.
Right there. All those nickels. You. You.
You. And you. Right there.
Put them in there.
- Somebody stole it.
- They played rough.
Where's my nickel?
- Who put those slugs in there?
- Not me.
- Kid, come on.
- Think I'd gyp you?
Rocky, you give us some practice tomorrow,
and we'll mop up these mugs.
I don't know nothing about that.
Better ask Father.
- Will you give us another chance tomorrow?
- Father! Come on!
- Give us some practice.
- Be a sport.
Well, I'll tell you...
...promise no fouls. Meet me here,
and I'll try to arrange a game.
- Can you get smaller kids?
- Yeah.
Oh, boy!
- You didn't know it was there, did you?
- No.
Just in time. Thanks.
Say...
...you going home?
- Yes.
I'll wait for you.
Hey, Rock...
...you wanna watch out. She's a jinx.
She put her last guy 6 foot under.
Anybody ask you?
I didn't say a word.
- Who's carrying your books for you now?
- Nobody.
I heard somewhere about you being
mixed up with a guy. Who was that?
There was only one: My husband.
- Took care of him?
- Yeah, about four years ago.
What happened?
What usually happens when a boy
gets mixed up...
...with a bunch of would-be
tough guys.
He was a swell kid
when we first got married.
But he tried to give me a lot more
than he could get driving a cab.
Partly my fault. I didn't stop him.
Well, he got in deeper and deeper.
One night, he tried to shoot it out
with the cops.
That's what always happens, isn't it?
Maybe with guys who don't know
their business.
Hey, look, I think I got something
in my eye. Can you see anything?
- No.
- Got a handkerchief?
Yeah, sure.
No, no. It's all right.
What's the difference?
I've seen everything.
You know, you were right the other day.
This neighborhood don't change much.
Know that?
There's too much traffic.
We gotta wait for a better opening.
Now, trail him slow. We'll get him.
Well, here we are.
Here we go.
Honey, make out this is where you
live. Say good night, and go inside.
- What's wrong?
- Stop asking questions. Go on in.
Sure. Good night, Rocky,
and thanks for bringing me home.
- Good night.
- Rocky, please be careful.
He just went in the drugstore.
Can I help you, sir?
I don't think so.
Cherry Coke.
You go in and keep the place cleared out.
I don't like the setup.
We gotta figure out something.
The guy's heel is in too good a spot.
We go in the front, he swings around
and starts popping. It's no good.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
We get him in the phone booth
where he can't move.
Hop in the delicatessen.
Ring the drugstore and ask for Sullivan.
Leave the receiver off the hook.
If he falls for it, we're set.
Okay.
Got a phone?
- How about my prescription?
- When'd you leave it?
- Yesterday.
- The name?
- Peterson.
- Excuse me. I'll see.
Hello. Nadler Drugstore.
Who?
Just a minute.
You Rocky Sullivan?
- Yeah.
- You're wanted on the telephone.
Hello.
Rocky Sullivan speaking.
Hold the line.
He fell for it. Ed, hop in the car
and keep close. Let's go.
Get in that backroom. Keep your mouth
shut and your eyes closed.
- Go on. Get going.
- I'll have it in just a minute.
Give me that canister.
Now back up.
Come on. Faster.
Now get in there, and get in deep.
Answer that phone.
Right over there, officer!
- What do you know?
- Never saw him before.
He asked for a prescription.
Said he left it yesterday.
I couldn't remember.
He said his name was Peterson.
Clean it out! Clear out!
Come on. Hurry it up.
Hey, can you see him?
There must be 100 holes in him.
Who do you think done it, Soapy?
- On your way! Beat it! Clear out of here!
- Who do you think you're pushing?
Hello, Frazier.
This is Bugs.
Everything's fixed. We got him.
That's good.
All right, drop out of sight
for a couple of days.
- Rocky.
- Yeah. Rocky.
I ain't dead yet. Give me those keys.
Get going.
Open it up.
I didn't have anything to do with it,
Rocky, I swear.
I ought to give it to you in the head,
but you owe me 100 grand.
It's yours, but I've only got about
Shut up and get it open.
Get away from there.
Saving these too?
You're a smart lawyer, Frazier.
A little too smart for your own good.
- Two grand.
- Yeah, that's all.
- There's some securities and some bonds.
- Get out of here. Sit down.
There. Fourth Street National, 280,000.
Farmers and Merchants, 160,000.
Industrial Trust, 65,000.
You done all right, Frazier.
I'm mighty proud.
- Why shouldn't I? We're partners, ain't we?
- Of course, Rocky. Of course.
Just like we said three years ago.
- Let's see...
- That's nothing.
Sit down and relax.
We're collecting autographs?
Some pretty important...
Some very important people.
Some officials here might be
interesting to know about.
Paid off just about everybody in town.
Made them sign too.
That's the way you held the club over
them? I'm gonna take this and study up.
- One partner should know about the other.
- Of course.
- What's Keefer's number?
- Circle-0500.
- His private number.
- That's it.
Dial.
Now, look. You're gonna get on there
and tell Keefer I'm coming in the morning.
And he's to get me that 100 grand,
you get it?
And no wrong cracks, or I'll cut you
off short. Got that too? Come on.
Hello, Mac? This is Rocky.
Yeah. Surprise, surprise.
No, I ain't down at the morgue.
It's one of your own boys. Look,
Frazier wants to talk to you. Go ahead.
Hello, Mac? Rocky will be up
at the El Toro in the morning.
to get to the bank.
to get to the bank.
Take $ 100,000 out of my personal
account and give it to him.
What's up? Is he holding you?
- Tell him yes.
- Yes.
You've got to do it, Mac.
You understand?
Okay. I'll give it to him.
- No slip-ups. It's very important to you.
- And no slip-ups. It's very important to me.
Okay, okay. I said I'd give it to him.
Come on.
Mac, I get you out of bed?
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I think he's sore.
Good morning, gentlemen.
Nice day for murder.
- Where's Frazier?
- Where's that 100 grand?
- Think we're gonna pay off?
- Certainly.
If I don't get it in three minutes,
Frazier will be splashed all over my hideout.
- You don't expect to get away with this?
- Why not?
I guess we can make you talk.
All right. Suppose you don't make me talk.
I give you a wrong number.
Another wrong number.
Meanwhile, Frazier's watching the clock,
waiting for the phone to ring.
How much you like Frazier?
- Give him the dough.
- Well, look...
Give him the dough.
Look...
...suppose you don't produce Frazier.
What do I want with him?
A hundred grand.
Give me a phone with an outside line.
Hello.
Poleano Vegetable Market.
Hello. Yeah, this is Rocky.
Look, when I walk past your window,
call that number I gave you.
But don't call if you see me
smoking a cigarette.
That means I'm being followed.
Hello. Hello.
What you talk? You crazy?
Yeah. Yeah, I got it.
Yeah. All right.
See, when I walk past that window...
...Frazier will be sprung.
Unless I'm followed.
Okay. Beat it and let him go.
We'll get him as soon as we see Frazier.
I got a better idea.
Get me the police station.
Hello.
It's Mac Keefer. Let me talk to Buckley.
Hello, Buck? Mac.
Yeah.
Listen, I'm gonna do something for you.
I'm gonna give you a hot tip.
Last night, Rocky Sullivan
snatched Frazier.
I just paid off 100 grand to him.
What are you doing, kidding me?
Yeah. Yeah, I get you.
Thanks for the tip.
Okay.
What you doing? I don't get you.
What's the idea of bringing
the cops in?
Because I'm not a mug.
I'm smart, see.
Sure, you'd like rough stuff.
Why, when you can do it nice and legal?
No trouble, no fuss.
And the top boys will like it. Why don't
you guys use your brains like I do?
- Soapy, my room.
- Be right up.
- Where's Rocky Sullivan's room?
- Upstairs.
Get out of here and stash that someplace
where it'll be safe. Don't open it.
Okay, Rocky.
This is it.
Come on, Sullivan. Open up.
Come in. It's open.
- How are you, Rocky?
- Hello.
Why all the artillery?
Reading your life story.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
You forgot the garbage can.
What did you do with it?
- Tell me what you're looking for.
- The dough.
- What dough?
- Get your coat on.
Speed it up, Rocky. You're not so funny.
It's killing me.
Quiet! Quiet!
- What the cops jug him for?
- He didn't have time to tell me nothing.
He gives me this and tells me to hide it.
- What do you think's in it?
- How should I know?
- Something valuable.
- Let's open it and see.
- Wanna lose your hand?
- What's the idea?
- Rocky said not to open it. See?
- All right. All right. I was just asking.
How'd you get away with it?
You should've seen them cops pass me
on the stairs. They don't know nothing.
And me with this in me shirt.
You're all wrong, boys.
There was no snatch.
- We was on a business trip, that's all.
- Come on, Rocky. Just spill.
- We've got all the dope anyway.
- Let me call my lawyer.
Oh, sure.
- Yeah. Who is your lawyer, Rocky?
- Frazier.
Hello, Jim.
- Hello.
- Don't know how you feel. You look terrible.
It wasn't any picnic down in the cellar,
with a lot of rats and dirt.
Maybe you'll leave the rough stuff to me.
Well, is it my fault if those apes of yours
can't get the right man?
- Did you put anybody after Sullivan?
- No.
- That's good.
- You did that once too often.
- I'm letting the coppers take care of him.
- You what?
I tipped them off that he snatched you.
I just got word they picked him up.
- That's what you shouldn't have done.
- It's already done.
You don't understand.
Sullivan got me at my home.
He's got everything in my safe:
Account books, receipts, names,
addresses, everything.
If he's prosecuted for this kidnapping,
he'll talk. He's got evidence to back it up.
He'll tear this whole town wide open.
- We gotta pull him out of there.
- Lf anybody pulled a boner, you did.
- Get me Buckley.
- Let me talk to him.
Hello. Hello?
Buckley? This is Mac.
Listen, you'll have to spring Sullivan.
Yes, I just learned it's all been
a little mistake.
Little mistake, what do you mean?
A mistake in a pig's eye!
You can't pull a thing like this on me.
- See you soon, Rocky.
- Not if I can help it.
Drive west.
Extra! Extra! Read all about it!
Lawyer kidnapped!
Extra! Extra! Lawyer kidnapped!
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir. Extra!
"Two-gun Rocky Sullivan,
well-known gangster...
...perpetrated the snatch
and received the money.
Sullivan evidently returned
directly to his boyhood haunt...
...following his release and was
here a few days...
...before he kidnapped James Frazier,
the prominent attorney and playboy.
Ransom asked was 100,000 smackers."
- Boy, you don't find that in poor boxes.
- Yeah. Leave it to Rocky.
- I'll bet that dough's in the envelope.
- Maybe it is. So what?
So the kid has an idea.
And if Rocky does go up,
it all belongs to us.
That envelope goes to Rocky, see?
Even if it gotta wait 20 years.
You won't have to wait that long.
- Rocky!
- Hey, Rocky!
Glad to see you.
We was just talking about you.
- Did you break out?
- No. I walked out.
- It said in the papers...
- Never believe them.
First you're in, and then you're out.
Boy, they certainly can't hold you, Rocky.
- Come on. Where's that envelope?
- I got it. I got it.
All right, let's have it!
Wait a minute, Rocky.
I'll get it for you.
Here you are, Rocky.
Just like you give it to me.
Hey, that's the 100 grand
the paper said you got, ain't it?
Asking questions again, huh?
Listen, someday you're gonna stick your
nose, and you're gonna get something in it.
- I only thought it was...
- Shut up!
Now, look, you don't know anything
about this, see?
No. No. No, I don't know nothing.
- But you do know what guys get who talk.
- Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah.
Now, look...
...that goes for the rest of you.
You understand?
- Certainly.
- Sure!
- Now we're pals.
- Put her there, Rocky!
All right, Soapy.
Here you are.
Cut that up any way you like.
- It's okay. I just saw it made.
- Thanks, Rocky.
Yeah, don't have to worry about the guys.
We once had a squealer in the gang,
but now he ain't got no teeth.
- I'll see you in a couple days.
- Hey, Rock!
- So long, Rocky!
- Bye, Rock!
Hey, Rocky!
- Have a good time!
- Come on, guys!
- You ought to join the circus.
- Yeah!
Here's your cut.
- Come on. Give me some of that.
- Fifty bucks!
"Fifty bucks!"
- Yeah! And the same for the rest of you too.
- Oh, boy, 50 simoleon.
My old man never made that much in his life
working for the Department of Sanitation.
- Hey, how much you got there, Soapy?
- About 100.
A hundred? How come?
It's twice as much as I got.
- You wanna make something out of it?
- No. No.
- He deserves it. Why you starting trouble?
- You pull in your ears.
What are we gonna do with it?
It's burning a hole through my hands.
I'm gonna get me a pair
of chromium-plated brass knuckles.
- Come on!
- Let's go!
- Can I come in, Rocky?
- Yeah. Yeah.
Wait a minute, Jerry.
Just a second! I wanna dry me hands.
- Hello, Jerry.
- Hello, Rocky.
- What do you hear? What do you say?
- What do you say?
You know, you gave me a terrific scare.
Before I finished reading about your arrest,
they said you were out.
Nothing to it. You know how it is
with a guy with a record.
Haul him in because you have
nothing else to do.
- They didn't keep you very long.
- What are you worrying about?
- Plenty.
- What's up?
The boys had a return game today,
and they haven't shown up.
I can't locate them.
- Thought you might know where they were.
- How would I? Am I a nursemaid?
No, Rocky. I didn't mean that.
Thought they might be up here
celebrating your release.
With them, it's kind of a hero worship.
You can't blame them for that, can you?
Rocky, why don't you tell me
what it's all about.
Look, Jerry, I've been answering
a lot of questions all morning, see.
A lot of them.
Frazier and me were just away
on a business trip.
Some dope wanted to start trouble and
have a laugh on the cops at the same time.
- Spread a false alarm, that's all.
- I'm glad it wasn't any more than that.
I'm gonna run along.
- Yeah? Hello, Laury!
- Hello, Father.
What do you say?
This looks like it's getting to be a big day.
I have to admit, I was pretty worried.
Sounds very nice to hear.
Well, Father, I finally located
our precious angels.
- You did? Where?
- Murphy's poolroom.
- What?
- Yeah, Soapy and the gang.
Passing out beer to the neighborhood
kids. Throwing dollar bills like confetti.
- Wonder where they got the money.
- Well, you might ask them.
- Well, I'm gonna be going, Rocky.
- So soon?
- Coming, Laury?
- No, Father.
I want to stay and talk to Rocky
for a while.
When will I see you, Rocky?
- I'll catch up with you.
- Okay.
Bye.
- Well, Rocky, I guess...
- Wait a minute.
You're the kind of gal that's smart enough
to mind her own business.
- Am I right or wrong?
- Don't worry.
I know all the rules.
Get your one here. Five. Get your 10 here.
All bets covered! Come on, put it in.
Where'd you get the dough, Pasty?
We wrote to Santa Claus, see.
Then when we woke up this morning,
there it was in our socks.
All bets covered. Come on, boys.
- Give me another one.
- What do you mean? All I bet was 5 bucks!
- You trying to gyp the kid or something?
- He owes me 5 bucks.
Shut up!
- Dirty tables aggravate me.
- You're gonna make this shot, you know.
- Put your eight ball on the corner.
- Okay.
- All right.
- Hey, bury that beef, will you?
Pull in your head and get that off the table!
Got a three ball off the corner.
Nice shot, boy!
Eight bucks!
Eight bucks! My mother has to work almost
all week to make this much.
Give, give, give.
All right. All right.
All gamblers die broke.
Hey, Soapy, you promised us another round
of beers if you won.
Okay, go on, bring up another case.
What's the difference?
Those chumps are paying for it.
- What is this, a raid?
- No.
Maybe they're gonna make
a Sunday school out of it.
- Come on. I'll take two.
- I got that covered.
- Give me two.
- I got it covered.
Weren't you boys going over
to start that game?
Sure, Father, we just wanted to see
what was going on in here.
Come on, Joe. Come on, kids.
Let's go to the gym.
Giving a party, Soapy?
Everybody invited?
Yeah.
Why don't you give it at the gym.
Because we're having it here.
What about that game you asked for?
Hey, Small Change...
...double that bet on that shot, okay?
- Okay. It's your murder.
Where did you get this money
you've been spending?
Hasn't anything I've told you for the last
three years meant anything?
You think that spending
this kind of money...
...with a lot of hoodlums is gonna get you
anyplace but jail?
Come on, fellas, what do you say?
Why not go with me, and we'll figure
this whole thing out.
Come on. Let's go over to the gym.
- How about it, Swing?
- I don't know, Father.
I got a sore leg.
What do you say, Bim?
Father, there ain't no future
in playing basketball.
- Well, how about you fellas?
- Can't a guy even have any fun?
It's a waste of time.
Look, Father...
...we don't fall for that pie-in-the-sky
stuff no more, see.
What's wrong? Can't you get them
to go to heaven with you?
You got the wrong slant, honey.
You got a bad break a long time ago...
...and you're still figuring
that's the only way.
You're reading stuff about
"crime don't pay."
Don't be a sucker. That's for smalltimers
on shoestrings. Not people like us.
You belong in the bigshot class.
Both of us do.
- I wonder.
- Look...
Got any glad rags, something fancy,
an evening gown?
- A very old one.
- Well, come on, get it on.
- We'll go out and celebrate.
- What will we be celebrating?
All this! You don't get on
the front pages every day.
You don't get away
from the cops every day.
You do if you're smart. Come here.
See those white lights up there?
That's where you belong,
and that's where you're going.
Come on, I'll show you who
this town's made for.
Well, I hope that old gown of mine
hangs together.
- Wants an eight.
- Wants an eight.
- Here's 10,000 on red.
- You got a bet!
Thirty-six, red.
- Place your bets.
- Give the lady a stack of black chips.
- For whom?
- For me.
- Rocky Sullivan.
- Oh, yes. Sure, of course.
Try your luck. I got some business.
I'll be back in a while.
- But, Rocky, I'm not lucky.
- Don't be afraid. Let your hair down.
- Have some fun. Go ahead.
- Place your bets.
- How much are these?
- Fifty dollars.
- Change them to dollar chips.
- But he wants black.
- I don't like black.
- Oh, you don't like black.
After I knew the facts, and seeing how
Jim owed you the dough...
...and it being a misunderstanding,
we'll call it square, with no hard feelings...
...especially now that you're
in the know of things.
- You boys really want to talk business?
- Yeah.
Come on, let's talk.
Look here, Rocky, what about
those accounts you took from my safe?
Those are very good insurance,
just in case you boys change your minds.
- Okay. What do you want, Rocky?
- Nothing from you, Mac.
Just my original agreement with Frazier:
That sounds fair enough, Jim.
All right. It's a deal.
Now, look, I'm gonna take very good care
of those accounts.
If I was you, I wouldn't do anything
I'd be sorry for...
...because I'm gonna pay special attention
to those books, understand?
A deal between you guys is a deal,
just like it was on paper.
- That's me, Rocky. I do everything legal.
- Oh, yeah. I know that.
If you don't mind, partners, my accountant
will go over the books...
...just to make sure you boys ain't cheating.
Fair enough?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
How long do you think I'll let that guy
sit in my chair?
Just as long as he hangs on
to that information.
- You like this place?
- Sure. Why wouldn't I?
- Just got a piece of it.
- Rocky.
- Yeah.
- Maybe you are smart enough.
How'd you like to give up that
two-for-nickel job and move in here?
Doing what?
Just sitting, looking pretty, dance a little,
play a little. Kind of a hostess.
Give you 100 a week and expenses.
And it'll be very nice to have
at least one friend in this place.
Come in.
Yes, Mrs. McGee, what is it?
Well, I've had lunch waiting since noon,
then this package came by messenger.
I thought maybe it was important,
so I brought it up.
All right. Thank you.
Is there anything wrong, Father?
No, no, nothing.
Oh, I won't have any lunch.
If I'd known that this morning,
I could've saved some money.
You wait. I'll tell him you're here.
Make yourself at home.
Thanks.
Hi, Jerry. What do you hear?
What do you say? Trying your luck?
Yes, I'd like to,
but I haven't got any money.
Except this, and it's not mine.
- Say, where did you get ahold of that?
- Where did you?
Here, Rocky. Thanks, but I can't accept it.
What's the matter? You silly?
That ain't mine.
I know it isn't. That's why I can't take it.
What is this?
You flash this wad on me, then try to tell
me the dough is mine. What's it all about?
You've got a great poker face, Rocky.
But don't forget, I've known that face
for a long time.
I know you forced Frazier to get you
$ 100,000. Everybody knows it.
What's the difference
where the dough came from?
First place, Frazier owed it to me.
It's mine.
Second, it's a lot better you get
a chunk of it than him.
And suppose the dough is hot?
Nobody knows that but you and me.
That's just it.
Oh, come on. Don't be such an angel.
You want to get the center built?
Go get it started!
I don't want to build it
on rotten foundations.
Oh, don't be a sucker!
All right, Rocky.
Supposing I take the money.
And I kid myself it's a means to an end.
Well, it isn't. Never will be.
Inside the center, my boys will be clean,
and outside...
...they'd be surrounded by the same
rotten corruption and crime and criminals.
Yes, yourself included.
Criminals on all sides for my boys
to look up to and revere...
...and respect and admire and imitate.
What good is it to teach
that honesty is the best policy...
...when all around, they see
that dishonesty is a better policy?
The hoodlum and gangster is looked up to
with the same respect...
...as the successful businessman
or popular hero.
You, and the Fraziers
and the Keefers...
...and the rest of those rotten politicians
you've got in the palm of your hand.
Yes, and you've got my boys too.
Whatever I teach them,
you show me up.
You show them the easiest way.
The quickest way
is with a racket or a gun.
Well, it's so, ain't it?
Yes, it's so. God help us.
You see, Rocky...
...I thought I could solve
my problems and...
Problems with my boys,
which, after all, they are...
...from the bottom up.
But I can't do it.
- I've got to start from the top down.
- Yeah? How?
I'll tell you how.
I'm gonna use your kidnapping Frazier
as a crowbar...
...to pry open and uncover
this cesspool.
I'm gonna force the law,
corrupt or not...
...to bring to the light of day
this filthy affair.
Now, there's gonna be a lot of people
stepped on, Rocky...
...and if you happen to get in the way...
...I'll be sorry, but you'll be stepped on
just as hard.
All right, Jerry, go to it. But you've got
as much chance of getting an indictment...
...as I have of getting into
Bible Society.
You'll find nobody cares.
You'll find them laughing at you.
End up a lot of blind alleys.
But go ahead, kid.
And if I'm in your way, why,
keep on stepping just as hard.
For being honest
and for old times' sake.
Rocky, there's one favor I'm gonna
have to ask you.
Maybe I won't be able to return it.
Well, go ahead. Anything you say.
Soapy and those kids,
give them a break, will you?
Don't offer them any more money.
Don't encourage them to...
To admire you.
All right. I'll do that.
Sure, you will.
Father Connolly, I'd like to help you.
I really would.
But we can't get away with it.
The organization is too powerful to fight.
You know what you're asking of me?
Yes, Mr. White.
The other papers have gone to great lengths
to explain the risks to me.
You'll go into the fight personally?
Devote your full time to it?
Believe me when I say,
nothing would please me any more.
Very well, Father Connolly, I'm with you.
The press will back you to the limit.
Thank you, and I appreciate it.
Get me the inside
on Frazier and Keefer's bank accounts.
I don't care where you get the dope
but get it.
Pap, get me all the information you can
on Frazier before he got to town.
If he'd ever been mixed up with Sullivan.
The lid is off on expenses.
Jenkins, go back through the police files
and find out...
...how many of Keefer's men
have been sprung since Frazier moved in.
Why are you hounding Rocky?
Why are you trying to send him
to prison for life?
You can't do that to Rocky.
I won't let you.
It's not his fault, Father.
He was just a kid who made a mistake
and got sent to reform school.
They made a criminal out of him.
But he's not bad, not really bad.
You know that.
And whatever they've done to him,
no matter what he is now...
...no matter whether he's right or wrong...
...we both love him, Father.
Yes, Laury, we both love him.
I've loved him since we were kids,
We worked together, fought together.
Stole together.
Oh, I'm not blaming Rocky
for what he is today.
But for the grace of God,
there walk I.
I'd do anything for him, Laury...
...anything in the world to help him.
I'd give my life if I thought
it would do any good...
...but it wouldn't.
You see, Laury,
there's all those other kids...
...hundreds of them, in the streets
and bad environment...
...whom I don't want to see
grow up like Rocky did.
I can't sacrifice them for Rocky.
You see, Laury, they have lives too.
I can't throw them away.
I can't.
And the very fact that countless thousands
of you are listening in tonight...
...is proof to fling in the teeth
of these cynics and skeptics...
...that the public does care
and does propose to do something...
...about the appalling conditions
I have tried to describe tonight.
And do not doubt that our efforts so far
have not struck fear and panic...
...into the cesspool of official
and near-official corruption.
Yeah, I'm shaking like a leaf.
"This very afternoon, I was approached
with a sugarcoated proposition...
...a bribe offered me
by this corrupt officialdom.
$ 100,000 for the building and equipment
of a recreation center in my parish...
...if I would agree to refrain
from further attacks...
...if I would sabotage this campaign...
...if I would shut my eyes, stop my ears
and hold my tongue.
But the building of an isolated playground
to shield my boys from crime...
...is not rooting out the crime itself.
We must rid ourselves
of the criminal parasites that feed on us.
We must wipe out those
we have ignorantly elected...
...and those who manipulate this
diseased officialdom behind locked doors.
Tonight, we have in our power
to ask definitely...
...incriminating questions
of these officials.
And the power to demand
satisfactory answers.
What really is the truth in the case of
the racketeer and gunman Rocky Sullivan?
Why did the police release him so suddenly
with all the evidence they had against him?
Why did the notorious Mac Keefer
pay Sullivan $ 100,000 in cash...
...and what political sword does he hold
over the trembling hands...
...of district attorneys, judges
and police officials?
But tomorrow, the new grand jury will meet,
and these questions must be answered.
Therefore, I ask all of you
who are listening in... "
And you thought you could
buy him off?
- I told you you were wasting your time.
- We ain't wasting any more time.
That was that guy's last chance.
We're gonna take care of him tonight.
You're talking through your hat.
You can't bump off a priest.
Forget it.
I'll forget it. Tomorrow morning,
when he's floating down the river.
Now, get this straight, Sullivan.
Even if he is an old pal of yours,
I'm still running the works.
I'm not taking orders from you
all of a sudden.
He's not gonna appear
at no grand jury tomorrow.
Shooting off his mouth...
I say he gets it tonight.
- Not if I'm around.
- Now, wait a minute, gentlemen.
There's no sense in running
too far ahead of ourselves.
Don't forget, there are all kinds
of grand juries...
...and there's all kinds of ways
of handling them.
That's what you got me for.
- Lf you can do a thing legally, why take a...?
- Sure, only I want action.
I don't care how we stop that guy,
I only want him stopped.
All right, then leave it to me.
You know, Rocky...
...this is no penny-ante reform wave
this priest is starting.
This is a tidal wave,
and unless we stop it quick...
...we're gonna find ourselves in the pen.
Look, Frazier, nobody knows better than me
that we're in a spot. I know that.
And, Mac, as far as I'm concerned,
you can settle it any way you like.
But lay off the rough stuff, you see?
That's out.
I'll see you later.
Don't worry, Mac. I've got an idea
how we can stymie that grand jury.
That preacher won't get to first base.
I hope you were stalling.
I meant what I said.
This is the way I figure it.
- Connolly is Rocky's pal, and he's a priest.
- So what?
Where would be the logical place
for Rocky to keep those accounts?
With a priest, to make them public
if anything happens to Rocky.
That ain't news to me.
I knew that.
- That's why he can be a wise guy.
- All right.
If we're gonna get that preacher tonight,
why not get those accounts too?
Yeah.
Only this time, no drugstore mistakes.
I'm taking care of this job myself.
Get Blackie up here right away.
Now listen, Mac. I don't care how
you handle Sullivan.
It's got to look like an accident
with the priest.
Leave that to me.
Rocky! Don't! Don't!
- I'll do anything.
- Oh, no, you won't.
You've had your last chance.
Take this with you.
I never let go of those papers.
All you had to do was bump me off.
- It's locked.
- Come on, stand back. Shoot it off.
Gunfight at the El Toro.
Is Father Connolly still there?
I must talk to him. It's urgent.
- Well?
- Rocky Sullivan, captain.
He got Frazier and Keefer. They've chased
him up on the roof of the El Toro.
MacMahon, throw a cordon
around the block.
Come on, you men, with me.
Here's the microphone, captain.
O'Flannigan, hook up those searchlights
and play them on the building.
Galavan, cover the warehouse skylights.
There he is!
Sullivan, are you coming out,
or must we smoke you out?
All right, give him the tear gas.
Please.
Captain.
I'm Father Connolly,
an old friend of Rocky's.
He'll come out for me.
He'll listen to me.
This is a job for the police, Father.
He'll need a priest later.
- You wanna kill him, or you want him alive?
- What do you mean by that?
He'll listen to me, I'm sure.
Won't you let me talk to him?
- Go ahead.
- Thank you.
Rocky! Rocky, this is Jerry.
Please come out.
Tell him we'll get him, if we have to
blow up the whole block.
Rocky, you've got to come out!
I'm coming up.
Officers, hold your fire.
Rocky?
- Rocky.
- What are you doing up here? Beat it!
I'm coming in, Rocky.
You wanna get your skull full of lead?
Get out of here!
You're smarter than to stick your kisser
in this place.
I couldn't watch them shoot you down,
Rocky.
They've got you covered from every angle.
Your only chance is to give yourself up.
You're through, Rocky. You're finished.
Yeah, I was until you stepped into it.
Father Connolly, are you all right?
Go on.
Get over there and tell them
to call off their dogs.
I'm going down with you.
Sure, you are.
Call off your men, all of them!
Sullivan's coming out with me.
Hold your fire, men, but stand by.
Let's go.
Come on, get them up, Jerry.
Sorry it has to be you, kid,
but get going.
Get away, or I'll let him have it!
Get away!
Back around.
Come on.
Get them up high. High!
Get back, all of you.
I'll give it to him right in the head!
Back!
Duck, Jerry!
Got him in the leg.
Empty.
So is your thick skull, copper.
Extra! Identify killer!
Papers! Get your papers! Extra!
Extra! Get your papers!
Identify killer!
Gee, that's tough.
Boy, I'd like to get my hands
on those squealers.
"Special prosecutor for trial of Rocky today.
State builds strong case."
That dope of a governor's so scared
of Rocky, he's appointing a special shyster.
"Rocky guilty. To die."
Gee, you think they'll burn him
in the chair?
No, they can't build no death house
that'll hold Rocky.
- You mean he'll blow it?
- Just wait, that's all. Just wait.
He'll show those mugs how to die
in a big way.
Sure, he will. They'll never make him crack.
- There's nothing yellow about Rocky.
- You bet.
Remember what he said at the trial?
He said he'd spit in their eye.
He'll do it too. He'll laugh at them.
Sure. Sure, he'll show those phonies up.
Sullivan.
Rocky, Father Connolly has received
permission to be with you.
He just arrived. You'll see him, won't you?
Yeah, sure, send him in.
But tell him none of that incense
and holy-water stuff, will you?
Whatever you say, Rocky.
Did you enjoy your dinner, Mr. Sullivan?
Yeah, it was good,
only the meat was burnt.
And I don't like burnt meat,
do you?
Listen, big shot, you got only
Don't try stalling around
with that priest pal of yours.
Ten minutes till that hot seat.
I'm gonna tell the electrician
to give it to you slow and easy, wise guy.
Somebody get him out of here,
will you!
- Come on! Take him out of there!
- Get him out of there!
Let him alone, Herbert.
Quiet.
Quiet, now! Quiet.
- How are you?
- How much time?
About 10 minutes.
Hi, Jerry. What do you hear?
What do you say?
- Hello, Rocky. How do you feel?
- Like a million.
- How's Soapy and the kids?
- Pulling for you all the way...
...as long as there's
the slightest hope from the governor.
- They'll be easier to handle without me.
- That's up to you, Rocky.
We haven't got a lot of time.
I want to ask one last favor.
- There's not much left that I can do, kid.
- Yes, there is, Rocky.
Perhaps more than you could do
under any other circumstances.
If you have the courage for it,
and I know you have.
Walking in there?
That's not gonna take much.
- I know that, Rocky.
- It's like a barber chair.
They're gonna ask, "Anything to say?"
I'll say, "Sure, give me a haircut, a shave
and one of those new electric massages."
- But you're not afraid, Rocky?
- No. They'd like me to be.
But I'm afraid I can't oblige them, kid.
You know, Jerry, I think to be afraid,
you gotta have a heart.
I don't think I got one.
I had that cut out of me a long time ago.
Suppose I asked you to have the heart, huh?
- To be scared.
- What do you mean?
Suppose the guards dragged you out of here
screaming for mercy.
- Suppose you went to the chair yellow.
- Yellow?
Say, what's the matter with you?
You've been worrying about my courage.
I know that.
This is a different kind of courage,
Rocky.
The kind that's...
Well, it's born in heaven.
Not the courage of heroics and bravado.
The kind that you and I
and God know about.
I don't know what you mean.
Look, Rocky, just before I came up here,
the boys saw me off on the train.
Soapy and several of the others.
You can well imagine what they told me.
"Father, tell Rocky to show the world
what he's made of.
Tell him not to be afraid...
...and to go out laughing... "
- Well, what do you want?
I'm not gonna let them down.
That's what I want you to do.
I want you to let them down.
See, you've been a hero to these kids and
hundreds of others, all through your life.
Now you're gonna be a glorified hero
in death, and I want to prevent that, Rocky.
They've gotta despise your memory.
They've got to be ashamed of you.
You're asking me to pull an act, turn yellow
so those kids will think I'm no-good?
You're asking me to throw away the only
thing I got left that they can't take away.
To give those newspapers a chance to say,
"Another rat turned yellow."
You and I will know you're not.
You ask a nice little favor, Jerry.
Asking me to crawl on my belly
the last thing I do.
I know what I'm asking.
The reason I'm asking is because
being kids together gave me the idea...
...that you might like to
join hands with me...
...and save some of those other boys
from ending up here.
You're asking too much.
You wanna help those kids...
...figure out some other way.
- It's impossible to do it without your help.
I can't reach all of those boys.
Thousands of hero-worshiping kids
all over the country.
Don't give me that humanity stuff again.
I had enough in the courtroom.
Told everything. Named names.
Told the whole mess.
What more do you want?
What I've always wanted, Rocky.
Straighten yourself out with God.
Outside of that,
I can't ask for anything else.
Well, don't!
It's time, Rocky. Are you ready?
Yeah.
You figure on going in with me?
- I'd like to, Rocky. That is, if...
- You can if you wish.
- Do you mind, Father?
- Certainly not.
That's better. Be kind of lonesome
going down that last mile.
Promise me something.
Promise me you won't let me
hear you pray.
I promise you won't hear me.
Get away from me, screw,
or I'll bust your face in.
It'll be the last face you see, big shot,
laughing at you.
Don't get near me now.
I'll spit in your eye.
Herbert, stand back.
Thompson, take care of him.
Lay off.
I don't need anybody. Come on.
Attaboy, Rocky.
Pick your own company.
So long, Rocky. We won't be long.
So long, Rocky.
Rocky, please.
No.
So long, kid.
Goodbye, Rocky.
May God have mercy on you.
No. I don't want to die!
Oh, please!
I don't want to die!
Oh, please!
Don't make me burn in hell!
Oh, please let go of me!
Please don't kill me!
Oh, don't kill me, please!
Okay, hold him down there!
Please don't kill me!
The yellow rat was gonna
spit in my eye.
"At the fatal stroke of 11 p.m., Rocky was
led through the little green door of death.
No sooner had he entered
the death chamber...
...than he tore himself
from the guards' grasp...
...flung himself on the floor,
screaming for mercy.
And as they dragged him
to the electric chair...
...he clawed wildly the concrete floor
with agonized shrieks.
In contrast to his former heroics...
...Rocky Sullivan died a coward."
I don't believe it.
- I don't believe one rotten word of it.
- I don't believe it either.
If anybody says it's true, I'll...
He couldn't die that way, not Rocky!
He couldn't.
It's all lies! Lies, I tell you!
Hey, fellas.
Here's Father Connolly.
Let's ask him. He ought to know.
He'll tell us everything.
You were there, Father.
You saw everything.
What happened?
Did Rocky die like they said?
Like a yellow rat?
It's true, boys. Every word of it.
He died like they said.
All right, fellas.
Let's go and...
...say a prayer for a boy
who couldn't run as fast as I could.
