Come on ladies, we're pushing pennies
around like a lot of old 'tards here.
Let's see a real bet.
Twice.
- That's better.
- Fold.
All in.
Good morning mate.
Delivery for you.
Fresh as you like.
Bloody hell.
What you plan on
doing with that?
I'm gonna chop his head off.
- You know I'm a vegetarian?!
- For Christ sake Tim!
I'm not asking you
to fucking eat it.
Only chop the head off.
Ben, I can't mate.
Really, I can't.
The head..
Is mine.
All right.
Johnny's got the head.
I've got the belly.
Which leaves you
the legs
the gut
or the fucking tale.
Where's the other fellow?
You're late.
Did I not make myself clear?!
The other fellow, where is he?
We can handle it!
Guarantied!
I need three of you inside.
You've got three of us.
You mean to tell me that tinker
bell here is gonna go inside?
No.. Tinker..
Tim.. will stay in the van.
All right.
So Tink takes the wheel
whilst you and loud
ass there go inside?
The two of you?
- I trust him with my life.
- Yeah, well I don't.
So you find someone else, otherwise,
the deal is of, all right?!
All right.
I'll find another guy.
Okay?
If..
And I mean if this goes
according to plan..
He's got a ring.
You take it!
The ring is very
important to him.
You might say it's
his little friend.
Adios.
Fucking tosser!
- Hello?
Wow, I'm touched.
Sounds like I'll come in for
a very good night tonight?!
Oh yes, but it was
different in my dreams.
Why is that?
You've been having those
dirty dreams about me again?
Hmm, but it happened in
a Polish restaurant.
- Oh shit.
No, that's no good, cause since you've
met me, all your dreams have come true.
I've ordered a table at
Gordon's, just the two of us.
An hour?
Well, at least it's not Polish.
Definitely not. And I
have a surprise for you.
Yeah, you should do.
Besides, I've got a little
surprise for you too.
Surprise?! I'm finally
going to meet the queen?
Who told you?
No, but..
I do have a little..
Now, there is a surprise.
I'll be there in a jiffy.
What the shitty fuck?!
Let go of me!
What the fuck?!
Take it off!
Please, let go of me.
Help?!
I'll give you anything!
You work for her Majesty?
What's it got to do with you?
You'd take a bullet in your
bullocks for queen and country?
What?
Even though the old deer makes you
work on your fucking birthday.
Johnny, you fucker!
Happy birthday mate.
God save the Queen.
Piss off Ben!
Come on! Come on! Let me out!
You scared the shit out of me.
Here. Happy birthday fellow.
Yeah, what were you doing
with that bunny rabbit, eh?
That is Jess..
Well it was just
Jessica's present.
I was thinking about
you, the whole time.
Oh, you pervert.
- And you?
- Sorry Michael.
We just wanted to give you
the best surprise ever.
Oh why, well you
certainly did that Tim.
No problem there!
All right, let's go!
- Go? Go where?
- Here.
All right, what?!
A wrank looking strip club. Even you're
not thick enough to think of going there.
Oh yeah, we forgot.
You're into cuddly
toys now, aren't you?
I am not going in there!
I don't care what you
say, I've had enough!
Jessica.
- Mickey?!
- No. I'm sorry, I've got to go.
- Must see Jessie, she's waiting on me.
- Mickey, for fuck's sake.
Will you just calm down?!
Mickey please?!
Look! I have to go and see Jessica,
all right?! She's waiting for me.
All right. I see the
surprise is out the window.
But we have to go and tell the girls.
Please, ten minutes?!
No, thank you. It's
not my business!
Come on mate please, for
fuck's sake, do us a favor.
All right, five
minutes, all right?!
And not a heartbeat more!
Okay Mickey. Just
turn the van around.
These girls might
take us by force.
Hopefully.
You sure are fucking cunts!
Let me tell you what John.
He's gonna go
apeshit when he finds out.
It's a fact mate.
Fuck you and your facts Tim.
We stick to the plan!
Here
We're closed.
Closed or not mate, I
have to drop this off.
You're not dropping
anything off mate.
I told you, the bar is closed. So
fuck off and come back tomorrow!
Shut it dickhead!
You know the trouble with
the world right now Karl?
Not enough trust.
But I'm gonna trust these cards.
When I said use your head,
I meant your own one.
Fresh meat.
What?
Wait! Wait! Wait!
Don't you flinch!
Put your hands on the table!
Where I can see them!
What the fuck is going on here?
Shut your mouth!
Or I'll shut it for you!
Open it up! Come on!
I think you pricks are
a little confused.
Slowly, don't you make me
fucking nervous. Come on!
Do you have any idea who
owns this establishment?
Who sent you?
The international
red fucking cross!
Let's gather the harvest.
Come on gentlemen!
Come on!
Faster gentlemen! Faster!
I said..
Five minutes!
Fuck!
Come on! Faster, you
fucking cripple!
Aren't you forgetting something?
Like what?
Your ring!
Are you deaf?!
Put the ring on the
fucking table!
Shoot!
What?
Shoot him!
No! Oh, no! I can't..
I can't do it!
Fuck! Shoot him!
Motherfucker I'm telling you!
I can't!
Pour his fucking brains out!
Now!
I can't.
You're such a fucking pussy!
Oh fu..
Get back!
I promise I'll aim
better next time.
You're fucking mental!
Really?! You're not
the first to notice.
I'll find you!
I'll fucking find you!
And when I do..
I'll cut of your fucking balls..
And when you fucking eat them..
I'm gonna pull them out of your
fucking asshole with this hand!
You fucking fat cunt!
Oy?!
Is this what you
were looking for?
What?
Don't play silly
puppets with me!
You wanted your play with
his ring didn't you?
Well, as it happens..
I've grown quite fond of it.
I think I'll just adopt to it.
I'll think of it
as a present!
Fucking knew.
You fucking snake!
Come on! Come on!
Move! Move! Move! Now!
Move! Fucking move!
You come and investigate,
you're the police.
I'll call you back.
Mickey start the van!
Wait, what happened?
Drive! Just fucking drive!
Now wait a minute.
- Move!
- All right!
Shittin' Jesus Christ.
What was all that about?
Nothing Mickey.
- We're all good.
- Good?!
How can it be good Johnny?
I heard a fucking gunshot!
Need to clear your
ears out mate.
Probably just been foy.
Oh fuck off Ben!
Calm down Mickey.
Girls just..
Got a bit upset, that's all.
But we got you a present.
Piss off with your presents!
Are you sure about that?
Don't think you want me fucking
around with your future.
What is that?
Problems with your
eyesight, lad?!
Oh fuck! No!
No! No! No! No! No!
What did you do Johnny? Eh?
What the fuck did you do?
Set you up mate.
Tell me you're just having
another laugh, all right?!
Tell me that this is
just a fucking wind-up.
Not really.
I know you're pissed
off now mate.
But please
just try to calm down.
You tell me to calm down
just one more time
I will fucking end you!
Look at it, we always said
we were to start it new.
Now we can. All of us.
We're sorted.
Whose money is that?
Look at it as a long-term loan.
With payment optional.
Who saw you? you?
As far as I'm aware, no one!
You're in the clear mate.
And by the time those
guys sort themselves out,
we'll be long gone.
Gone?!
Gone where?
Malaysia my friend.
Sunshine. Paradise is
just around the corner.
And we've got a place for you.
If you're willing to join us.
Shit!
This is fucking real?!
You really are all just the
sneakiest, fucking donk shit, right?!
You're right Johnny,
you clever bastard.
Nobody did see me.
So I weren't there.
Just so we're clear?!
I didn't do anything!
You don't know me.
And I don't know you.
Any of you!
And if I ever see you again.
You're fucking dead!
I'll kill ya'll!
His name's John.
I don't know his last name.
That's all I know Paul, I swear.
Believe me.
I know I fucked up, I
fucked up big-time Paul.
But give me a chance, yeah?
And I'll get the fuckers myself.
I promise.
They'll pay.
Yeah, they'll pay.
I'll get the fuckers
myself, and they'll pay.
I promise you they'll pay, ok?
I'll get them! I'll
get them Paul.
Yeah? I'll get them..
Pst!
Fuck up!
I'll crush you!
I believe you.
Yeah?
Everybody pays.
Yeah.
He was in the fucking van.
He seems fucking familiar to me.
How come?
If that really is him then..
Then we've just been fucked
by the honorary guard of her
Majesty, Queen Elizabeth,
the fucking second.
If we get this little
prick, we find the others.
I want you to take
all of our boys
find out where they fucking live
where they drink
and even if they're coming up
to the queen of fucking England
I want them crown jewels.
- Hello?
Oh, Jess.
Yeah, I.. I'm sorry darling.
- Yeah, I'm on my way there now.
Are you ok? What's
the matter with you?
No no..
No. Everything's honky..
Everything's fine!
Hurry up then.
Yes, yes! I'll be there
in a minute, all right?!
Oh fuck!
- Oh shit!
- He's inside!
Fuck!
Shit.
Fucker's got away.
I need to go to the toilet.
Tim, what the fuck
are you doing?!
You don't know me!
I'll be back in a sec.
Excuse me.
Jesus Christ!
I promised ya'll I'd kill you!
Michael, I'm sorry! I wanted
to tell you, honestly.
Where is it?
I'm sorry.
Where is it?
It's on me!
Fuck!
Michael, don't do this! Listen, right!
There's no way back!
Mike, what the fuck
are you doing?
Mickey..
They found me Johnny!
Do you understand me?!
They found me and then
nearly fucking killed me!
Fuck you Mickeeey!
This is the final boarding call for
passengers on the flight F43421C
to Kuala Lumpur.
Please proceed to
gate C, immediately.
Thick clouds of
ash flew up today
forcing airlines to cancel
thousands of flights.
It drifted at high altitudes south & east,
from an erupting volcano in Iceland.
The airspace shut-down was one of the
most sweeping ever ordered in peace time.
The cloud made up of
minute particles of
silicate, that can severely
damage jet engines,
left airplanes stranded on the tarmac of
some of the world's busiest airports,
as it spread over Britain and
towards continental Europe.
5,000-6,000 of the 28,000 daily
flights across Europe were cancelled,
or redirected to the nearest available
airports, as the results of the ash plume.
The ash plume of volcano Eyjafjallajökull,
was reported to be drifting
at 18,000-33,000 feet
above the earth.
At those altitudes, the cloud is directly
in the road of commercial airliners...
Excuse me mate. Where are we?
Sorry mate, I don't speak
Malaysian, I'm sorry.
We found them.
It was about fucking time.
They didn't get as
far as Malaysia.
Some big volcano has
just erupted in Iceland.
The flight redirected.
To Lithuania.
Lith-a-fucking what?
Lithuania?!
Not Malaysia?!
It's in Eastern fucking Europe.
And the bastards
are still there.
How?
I mean how? How? How
did I get here?
You arrive here
about two hours ago
from the airport
with three friends.
I like them fucking Islandicks.
But I like the
volcanoes even better.
Let's get our asses
fucking out there.
Hey barman, give me some vodka.
Cheers fellow.
Benny my boy, lucky tonight.
See you back at the hotel.
I'll see you later.
Ben, don't you think we
should get back to the hotel.
You've gone fucking soft?!
I'm not going back to
some shitty hotel!
Hello boys. Our hen party
needs some company.
Where're you from?
England.
- Come on girls, surround them.
- All right ladies.
Right here, fucking right here!
Fuck!
Oh, you dumb fucks!
- Hello?
Jessica, thank God!
Were you ever planning
on calling me back?
What are you doing? Do you
have any idea how I feel?
Yes! Yes I know.
I'll be back in a couple
of hours, I promise!
- Jessie listen!
- Airport please mate.
You're going to the airport?
Without me?
Good night my friend.
And you can't even explain to
me where you pissed off to?!
Why is that? Just don't call me anymore.
I don't want to hear shit anymore.
Jess, it's very, very confusing!
But you have to trust me!
Yes!
Lithuan.. Oh, Jesus Christ.
- It doesn't really matter.
I will explain everything to
you, when it becomes clear.
Why've we stop.. Look, can you just
wait a minute? Why've we stopped?
Look! I need to get to the airport mate!
I'm in a bit of a hurry..
Who's this now?
- What are you doing to me?
You're a son of a bitch Michael. How can
you have fun when my heart's broken?
How can I have ever
gotten with you?
And you have nothing
to say for yourself?
Oh fuck!
Oh Jesus Christ.
Hi.
I don't even know
how I got here.
I don't know where any of my
friends are and I need help!
Is your room 1402?
No, yea.. I don't know, why?

Hmm... Men!
We said we're friends of yours.
Did they now?!
Johnny?!

Who are you? What do you want?
I was going to ask
you the same thing.
Oh now, there's been
some kind of a mistake.
Mistake?!
Where there's a lot of greed,
there's plenty of mistakes.
No! You see, I didn't
know anything.
They set me up. They
ruined my plan.
Plan?!
Your plan is going to end
up the same way as Karl's.
Where is the money?
It was in here. I wanted
to give it back to you.
I swear to God, I wanted
to give it back to you.
Where's my fucking ring?

bells with you?

They're in my hotel.
They want their money.
But, it was taken, you
see, it's all gone.

You want me to be
honest with you?!
They're not my actual friends.

them, but that is not important.
They are going to kill me.
You have to believe me!
What's money?
Who robbed you?
You?
How much money?
