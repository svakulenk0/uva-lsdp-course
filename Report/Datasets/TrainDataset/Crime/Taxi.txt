Quiet.
Quiet.
Quiet
Please give your attention to Agent Mullins
FBI Armed Robbery Unit
Thank you It's tape of this morning's robbery
Watch close
It goes by pretty fast
Four cameras
Four perfect shots
In and out in 35 seconds.
Lieutenant, you have the witnesses'statements.
Miss Williams,
I'm Lieutenant Robbins
This is Agent Mullins with the FBI
We want to ask you a few questions
- Am I under arrest?
- Well, no
Then I ain't answering no questions
until somebody tells me
who is paying for the damage on my cab
and when do I get it back?
Miss Williams, I'm afraid your vehicle's
physical evidence now
- We have to run ballistics tests...
- Ballistics tests? On what?
We already know
who shot my cab
It was that stupid idiot right there
with that dumb look on his face
That's not fair
Agent Mullins wasn't even on the scene
- I was talkin' about you
- Me?
You shot my back window out
You could've shot me
- You don't talk to me like that
- I'll talk however I want
- Get him out.
- Take his stinkin' ass out of here
- All right, all right I'm sorry
- Are you kidding me?
- I'm sorry
- That is the FBI in there You need to calm down
Somebody better talk to him.
Sorry 'bout that, dude, um, sir
The adrenaline's still pumping
You know what I'm saying?
Had a crazy morning
I'm a little out of line,
and I apologize
Detective Washburn,
you were the first one on the scene, correct?
Yes, I was
I was the first one on the scene
My first instinct is to give you a shot
at leading this investigation
- However, I spoke with your lieutenant
You're off the case
- Permanently
- What?
Nice meeting you
I know
Y... Marta, you can't...
Lieutenant
- You can't...
- Enough
Now, go clock in
You're late for your shift
I already told you everything I know
You can't hold me.
Now, I want my cab.
- Says here you did a year in juvenile hall
- That's supposed to be sealed
Joyriding Graduated to reckless driving,
fleeing the scene of an accident...
look at this... moving violation,
moving violation, moving violation
- Come on Everybody got a few tickets
- Not 75
And not on a bicycle,
Miss Williams
Officers at the front desk will give you
the forms you need to fill out.
As far as your car's concerned, you'll get that back
when we're done Two weeks, maybe longer
Two weeks? Come on, man
This is bullshit
That's notjust my car.
That is myjob.
Wh-What am I supposed to do?
Give people piggyback rides to Newark Airport?
One more question
Did you ever get close enough
to see the guy driving the car?
No, sir
All I saw was their taillights
Can I go now?
- Here we go again.
Didn't I say 5.00? Where are you?
- Jesse.
I feel like a damn fool, B,
thinking you'd actually be here on time
- I tried
- No, no, no No I'm tired of hearing excuses, okay?
I'm sittin' in my cab, right?
All of a sudden out of nowhere, this guy jumps...
Hello? Baby?
Jesse?
What the hell
could be so damn important?
- Freakin' day I had
- Hey Miss Williams
- You again
- Hey, hey, hey
- Go ahead Talk
- I just wanna talk
- Talk then
- I can get you your cab back
Come on
Come on
You gotta help me first
Okay? Just hear me out
They got five detectives on this case.
We gotta catch these guys first.
All I got to go on is
the MO, modus operandi
- That's police jargon for...
- I know what it means
- It's not police jargon It's Latin
- Right Whatever It's both
They were pretty quick though
They were in and out in, like, under a minute
That's real pros Witnesses
said they're either Spanish or Italian
Nah, I think they're Brazilian
They were speaking Portuguese
- You sure?
- Confia em mim.
My first job was delivering food at...
Brazilian
This is huge
Hey, why are we not
doing this at the station?
Sometimes a good cop's got to bend the rules
so that laws don't get broken
You know what I'm saying?
I'm not afraid to live outside the law.
You living outside of your mind
That's where you live
Well, the reports here say
that the man driving was about 5'10"
No No, no, no, no
If that was a man, so am I
She looked like a model
Tan, blondish hair
All right As I was saying
It was a woman driving
- and she was driving a Mercedes... an Au...
- No
- Mm-mmm No, no, no
- She was driving... Definitely you saw her driving
- a BMW?
- Right
- Yeah, but not just a BMW It was a 760
- Mm-hmm
- But the engine sounded lighter
- Light, yeah
Now, with that much torque, she had to have
an inboard torsion damper system
with a push rod bell crank
and double wishbone arrangement.
Wait a minute
You shot her tire out, didn't you?
Yeah Standard OP
- That's police jargon for...
- But she kept on going
'cause she had run flats
Yeah, that's what I thought
She had "runs" flats on
Armored tires They seal themselves
with a gel when they're punctured
Now, they're good,
but they only go for about 50 miles
So, if she wants to drive that car again,
she's gonna have to get a new tire
And there's only one place to get that tire
around here Lou's Garage in Secaucus
- What are we waiting for? Let's hit it Take my ride
- All right
There's my baby, right there
- This is your unmarked car?
- We found her
A Daewoo? Man, I know people
I can't be seen in this thing
Tsk Open the door
I don't wanna get Daewoo on my hands
Buckle up for safety, everybody
Hard to do it with my holster on
Okay, we're good
Good, wipers work
Mirrors work
And here we go
Oh, damn
- Whoa! Sheesh, man
- Little ding Little ding
- That's why you got bumpers
- Can't you... What the hell?
- You trying to kill me?
- I'm not a perfect driving robot
- I know Oh! What are you doing?
- Here comes Junior
- Here comes Junior
- You can't... Oh, shit! Wait! Stop Stop Stop
What the hell are you trying to do,
a 78-point turn?
- Can you get us out of this spot?
- Yes

Everyone just chill out
Be real cool about it
God... damn!
Now, I'm turning the wheel
Turning the wheel

Daggone whiplash
You got a driver's license?
Let me get my belt on
Who the hell gave you a driver's license?
That's what I wanna know
Okay, after I show you this place,
I'm gonna get my cab back?
- Deal.
- 'Cause I don't really trust you.
Soon as I know this is the place,
we'll go back to the station, I'll get your cab back.
- This is it?
- Yep
If they gettin' that car fixed,
they-they gotta come here
- So, what now?
- We wait
You can open your eyes now
I'm done
You didn't see my nads, did you?
Man
So, you got guy problems, huh?
Overheard you and your man on the phone
Want a little bit
of wisdom from the man side?
I'll give it to you
Men are like cats, you know?
Sure, we'll play with
the ball of yarn
unless you want us
to play with the ball of yarn
Trick is,
hide the ball of yarn
Don't hide it where you can't find it,
you know?
"Hey, what's the ball of yarn
doin' in the fridge?"
Whatever
You know what I'm saying?
You know, cops are supposed
to talk to each other on stakeouts
It helps the mission
go by faster
- Would you please shut up?
- Okay That's cool
You wanna be quiet? That's cool
No room for chitchat That's fine
I don't care I don't need...
I don't need to talk
We'll just sit here
in silence
So, are you into cars, or...
I mean, what got you into cars?
I mean, were you always into them?
Did you just, like, stumble upon them?
Damn My grandpa
- Okay?
- Yeah
W-What?
He loved driving, or...
Yeah He was a mechanic
Taught me everything I know
We used to live
next to a track
You used to go to the track all day?
That's fun
No We didn't really go that much
I mean, we went to a couple races
But mostly, we would just listen
to the races together
I could hear those cars.
Hear those engines.
I got good
l-I got to the point where
I could tell who won the race
without even seeing it
- Yeah. Driving NASCAR. That's my dream.
- Wow
Wait. Let me ask you something.
Why would you take a taxi to a bank robbery?
I mean,
I've never seen that

B.M. W. Pulls out in front, right?
Well, see, that's the amazing thing right there...
getting a parking space in Manhattan.
YeahJesse's totally right
Wait a sec
How do you get a parkin' space in front
of a bank two days in a row? In Manhattan?
Yeah, 'cause the only places I ever find
are no-parkin' zones:
Loadin' zones, hospitals
or streets that are "no parking" for, uh...
- Garbage day
- Yeah
- Garbage day
- Yeah
- The whole side of the street is a no-parkin' zone
- Course!
So, they rob the bank early in the morning,
then they put the cash in the garbage can.
We chase the Beemer The garbage truck
picks up the cash,
and they meet up later on
So even if you do catch 'em,
that's why they ain't got the money on 'em
The only thing they need to pull it off
is a garbage man
- We gotta find that garbage man
- Okay
- Bye, Mom
- Hold on. Where you goin'?
Bye, baby
Wait, wait! Yo, whoa!
Yo, what do you want me to do with this?
We can't wait till the morning
