This is car 71. Roger.
Gus.
Gus.
- What time this punk come in?
- I don't watch the clock.
- I own the joint.
- No gun.
I'll search the joint.
- You got a warrant?
- Look, why don't you cooperate.
- Get a warrant.
- Take him in.
- On what?
- We'll book him on vag.
All right. Come on, you.
Come on.

That's enough.
Well, do you see the man
who pulled the stickup last night?
- I don't know.
- What do you mean, you don't know?
He had a hat on.
Put on your hats.
Well?
He was tall, you say. He had on
a brown suit and a wide-brim hat.
All right. Don't you see him?
Well, come on. Is that him?
No, it isn't him.
- Okay.
- That's all.
Lieutenant Ditrich, commissioner
wants to see you in his office right away.
Sit down, lieutenant.
Thank you, sir.
Thirty-nine thefts, 33 burglaries,
...five morals offenses
in the past 30 days.
Quite a record,
even for the 4th Precinct.
We know the guy who's been pulling
most of the stickups.
Name's Dix Handley.
He was in the show-up this morning, but
our witness got cold feet and backed down.
- What can you do?
- Lock up the witness! Scare him worse!
It's your job, knowing what to do.
The only merchants
safe from harm in your precinct...
...are those who take wagers
on the horses.
I wanna know why those
parlors are still operating.
I close them down,
but they open up again.
You don't close them hard enough.
Rip out the phones, smash up the furniture!
People like to bet the horses,
and just because the law says...
I don't want your opinion of the law.
- Is that all, sir?
- No, that's not all.
- Where's Erwin Riedenschneider?
- I'm waiting to hear on that, sir.
You don't know where he is, do you?
No, but we ought to get
a word from our stoolies.
It was all dumped in your lap.
He left prison yesterday at 12 noon, took
a train for this city, time of arrival, 3:17.
All you had to do was stay with him
for 24 hours.
If he didn't register, lock him up.
What happens?
He loses you five blocks from the depot,
and a dangerous criminal...
...is at large in this city.
Two men on that detail
ought to get medals for dumbness.
They were assigned by you.
You should get one too.
Ditrich, I can do three things about you:
I can reduce you to patrolman,
send you down to Five Corners.
I can bring you up for trial
on charges of incompetence.
Or I can give you one more chance
to make good on your responsibilities.
I think that'll be
the greatest punishment of all.
Thank you, sir.
There's the number you're looking for,
but it's dark.
You want me to wait?
I wouldn't go parading around
this neighborhood with a suitcase.
Some of these young punks might clip you
just to get a clean shirt.
- Yeah?
- I want to see Cobby.
- Who are you?
- Just say Doc is here...
...and would like to see him.
Wait here.
You'd better be on the legit, pal.
Well, where the devil is he?
I'm a busy man.
What do you want?
I just got out today.
Oh, so that's it.
I'm tired of you guys
putting a bite on me.
- I'm no bank.
- I got a proposition for you.
All you guys have.
- Maybe you didn't get who I was.
- I ain't never seen you before. What is it?
Maybe you've heard of me.
The Professor? Or Herr Doctor, maybe.
You mean, you are Riedenschneider?
Well, why didn't you say so?
Come on in, Doc. Come on in.
Sit down, Doc. Sit down.
- Have a drink?
- Nothing to drink.
I got out of the habit behind the walls.
That's all it is, a habit.
Well, here's to the drink habit, the only one
I got that don't get me into trouble.
Well, Doc. What's on your mind?
I got a proposition. A big one.
- How big is big?
- Too big for you, Cobby.
Now, wait, Doc. I don't like to brag,
but I'm doing all right.
Making book. I'm in the chips.
What kind of proposition is it?
A plan for a caper.
And it's a good one.
I could sell it for $ 100,000
on the open market...
...but that would be
throwing money away.
- I prefer to execute it myself and make...
- How much?
Half a million dollars.
Maybe even more.
I will have to do a little checking,
as the plan is some years old...
...but not much checking. Not much.
I need roughly 50,000 to operate.
Fifty thousand?
- No, no, no. I don't see.
- Of course.
I thought maybe Mr. Emmerich
What do you know about Mr. Emmerich?
Only what I heard in the walls...
...that he has money to invest and that
the way to get to him is through you.
- Lf my information is not correct...
- Correct, sure. Sure. It's correct.
I just never thought of Mr. Emmerich
in connection with this kind of deal.
Excuse me a minute.
I'll be right back.
- Hello, Dix. What do you want?
- I wanna make a bet.
- Well?
- Your man says you got to okay it.
- What are you in for?
- 2300 and some.
Okay. Your tab's good for 2500...
...but that's the limit. Either pick a winner
or pay me when you get that far.
Don't bone me!
- I'm not...
- Did I ever welsh?
- Nobody said you did...
- You just boned me.
I'm not asking you any favors.
I'll go get you your 2300 right now.
Now, Dix. Now, Dix, listen.
Will you have a drink? Come on.
Come on. Come back here.
Have a drink, will you?
Can you beat that?
- Where does he come off, blowing a fuse?
- Who is he?
A smalltime hooligan,
who's crazy for horses.
My book beats him and beats him,
he keeps coming back for more.
Say, Doc...
...I forgot on account of that big tramp.
I spoke to Mr. Emmerich on the phone.
He's gonna meet us later tonight.
He's giving a party at his house in town
for a bunch of swells...
...but he'll be at another address later on.
A man like Emmerich has got
more than one place to hang his hat.
Smart cat. Never does a lick of work,
stays out all night, sleeps all day.
What's a big, dirty cat
doing at an eating joint?
I run over one every time I get a chance.
People feeding cats,
and some kids haven't got enough to eat.
You gonna buy that magazine?
Why should I?
I seen all the dames in it already.
Wanna make something of it?
- You're a little off your beat.
- How do you mean, Humpty Dumpty?
I mean, you don't belong around here.
You're just passing through,
only not fast enough.
If I ever see you running over a cat,
I'll kick your teeth out.
I'd take you apart if you were about
a foot taller and straightened up a little.
Suppose you want your heater back.
Well, you ain't gonna get it.
How about that?
- Quit kidding, Gus.
- I mean it.
Go on, get sore. Smack me down.
- You know I wouldn't do that.
- Look, Dix...
...take my advice
and knock off for a while.
The happiness boys are on a rampage.
Headquarters has given them the push.
- I can't afford to knock off.
- Oh, stop worrying. I'll stake you.
- Yeah? I need 2300.
- What?
- Something I just gotta take care of.
- Cobby, maybe?
Well, let him sweat. It'll do him good.
Cobby can spare a few pounds.
You can't owe money
to a guy like him...
...a little loudmouth who bones you
when he isn't even trying to.
I don't get you, Dix.
I just can't be in Cobby's debt
and keep my self-respect.
All right.
I got a grand put away.
You can have that.
Maybe I can dig up 1300 more.
- I guess it's all right to owe me, huh?
- I guess.
Yeah. It's just my luck.
Well, I'll get it tomorrow or bust a gut.
In the meantime, stay away
from the boulevard, especially at night.
By the way, they knocked over
the Club Regal.
- Wasn't that where Doll worked?
- Yeah.
It's coming in bunches, it looks like.
Go home, Dix. Stay home.
Don't get your flag at half-mast.
Remember, you still got old Gus.
Thirteen hundred? You must be crazy.
For Dix? What do I care
for that hooligan?
I'd like to help you out, Gus,
but I got mouths to feed...
...and rent to pay and all that stuff.
You're a low-down scum.
A low-down, dirty scum,
to talk to me like that.
Look, Gus.
I guess I can make it, all right.
- Yeah?
Doll?
Hi, honey.
Come on in.
- Close the door.
- Well, sure, Dix. Sure.
I'm awful sorry to bother you,
honey, but
Doll, if you're gonna smoke,
you gotta learn to carry matches.
Doll, what are you crying about?
Nothing...
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Dix.
I don't know what I was thinking about,
bothering you at this time of the night.
I'll just run along.
Gus told me the Club Regal
got knocked over.
Yeah. Can you imagine, raiding the Regal?
The cops must have all gone crazy.
So it's a clip joint. So what?
And it would have to happen
on pay night.
- How about a drink?
- Hey, don't care if I do.
One of my eyelashes is coming off.
Were you locked out of your room?
How'd you guess?
Here's how.
Dix, if it wouldn't be too much trouble,
could I stay here a couple of days?
Just a day or two.
All right. Stay if you want to,
but don't you go getting any ideas, Doll.
Everything is here, from the observed
routine of the personnel...
...to the alarm system,
the type of locks on doors...
...the age and condition of the main safe
and so forth, so forth.
Take my word for it, Mr. Emmerich.
This is a ripe plum ready to fall.
My friend, according to the boys,
all takes are easy...
...but as a lawyer, I make lots of money
getting them out of jail.
Please, Mr. Emmerich.
Perhaps you know my reputation.
I've engineered some very big things.
That's a fact, Mr. Emmerich.
Doc here is tops.
Am I to understand you gathered this
information before doing your last stretch?
That is correct.
I was ready to begin operations...
...and the cops grabbed me for
an old caper I'd almost forgotten about.
The Adelphia Finance caper.
You took them for 160,000,
didn't you, Doc?
A hundred and fifty-eight.
You really believe
there's a million in this thing?
- Maybe even more.
- You mean by that...
...that the take will be worth
half a million to us in actual cash?
You know as well as I do
that in no case will a fence...
...give you more than 50 percent.
- That's right, sir.
- Well, what are your main problems?
- There are three.
Money to operate, personnel
and finally, the disposing of the take.
No trouble about the first, eh?
Wait a minute.
This remains to be seen.
The helpers will be paid off
like housepainters.
They'll be told nothing
about the size of the take.
Sometimes, men get greedy.
- Well, how many helpers do you need?
- Only three.
A box man.
Him, we pay most.
Maybe $25,000.
I got a guy for you. Louis Ciavelli.
Best box man west of Chicago.
Expert mechanic.
Been in some very big capers.
From what I hear, he can open a safe
like the back of a watch. Only, he costs.
Then we need a topnotch driver,
in case of a rumble.
He should get 10,000.
And finally, sad to say,
we need a hooligan.
Most of these fellas are drug addicts.
They're a no-good lot.
Violence is all they know,
but they are, unfortunately, necessary.
For a more or less reliable man,
I'd say 15,000.
Well, that's 50,000 in all.
How...?
How's this take to be handled?
Get in touch with the best fences
in the Midwest...
...and deal with whoever makes
the highest offer.
Maybe no one fence
can handle the whole thing.
In that case, we deal with two or three.
Half a million, eh?
I
I'm just thinking.
If I decide to go into this thing, I
I, myself, I might handle the...
You, a fence, Mr. Emmerich?
Oh, no, no, Cobby. Not exactly.
But your proposition looks pretty good.
I'd like to see the most made of it.
Oh, I suppose a fella should stick
to his own trade...
...but I know some big men that might
not be averse to a deal like this...
...if they're properly approached.
Highly respectable men, I might add.
So why don't you let me see what I can do
before you look for a fence.
A few days wouldn't make
much difference to you, I don't suppose.
Might mean a lot more money
for all of us.
Good. There's just one thing.
I dislike to mention it, but...
...I've just come from prison and
- Well, of course.
Cobby will be glad to advance you
anything you need.
- See that you have a place to stay. Cobby?
- Well, you bet your life.
And I got some fancy phone numbers
for you too, Doc.
What's it like, a man of your taste,
seven years behind the walls?
Not too bad.
It's a matter of temperament.
I cause no trouble.
The prison authorities appreciate that.
They made me assistant librarian.
I'm afraid I wouldn't make
a model prisoner.
After this job, it's Mexico for me.
I'll live like a king.
Mexican girls are very pretty.
I'll have nothing to do all day long
but chase them in the sunshine.
- You've been very kind, sir.
- Good night. Good night.
- Mr. Emmerich.
- Cobby.
What's the big idea, standing there
staring at me, Uncle Lon?
Don't call me "Uncle Lon."
I thought you liked it.
Maybe I did.
I don't anymore.
I had the market send over
some salt mackerel for you.
I know how you love it for breakfast.
Some sweet kid.
It's late.
Why don't you go to bed.
Some sweet kid.
Hello, Bob Brannom?
This is Emmerich.
No, no. I didn't call you
to get the right time.
Listen, I've got a job for you.
No, no. Nothing like that.
I've got over $ 100,000
standing out on my books.
Come to my office tomorrow, I'll give you
a list of the people that owe me.
No, no, no.
Use the method called for
in each particular case...
...and don't tell me anything about it.
All I want is results.
Easy, boy.
Easy, boy. Easy.
Hello. Who?
Oh, sure, Gus.
He's still asleep.
What?
Yeah. Yeah, I'll tell him.
Honey. Honey, that was Gus.
He says you can come over.
He's got something for you.
Okay.
Coffee, honey? I made fresh.
Yeah, yeah.
Hey, you sure were dreaming.
How do you know?
You were talking in your sleep.
What was I saying?
It was all jumbled up,
but I heard one word real plain.
You called it out several times.
"Corn cracker."
What's that mean?
Corn cracker.
Corn Cracker was a colt.
Yeah, it would be.
Yeah. He was a tall, black colt.
Yeah, I remember what I was dreaming.
I was up on that colt's back.
My father and my grandfather were there,
watching the fun.
That colt was buckjumping
and pitching...
...and tried to scrape me off against
the fence, but I stayed with him.
Then I heard my granddaddy say, "He's
a real Handley, that boy. A real Handley."
And I felt proud as you please.
Did that really happen, Dix,
when you were a kid?
No. The black colt pitched me
into a fence on the first buck...
...and my old man come over,
prodded me with his boot, said:
"Maybe that'll teach you not to brag
about how good you are on a horse."
It's nice to hear you laugh.
You know something?
One of my ancestors imported the first
Irish thoroughbred into our county.
- Is that a fact?
- Sure.
Why, our farm was in the family
for generations.
One hundred sixty acres,
Fine barn and seven brood mares.
- It sounds wonderful, Dix.
- It was.
And then everything happened at once.
My old man died,
and we lost our corn crop.
That black colt I was telling you about,
he broke his leg and had to be shot.
That was a rotten year.
I'll never forget the day we left.
Me and my brother swore we'd buy
Hickorywood Farm back someday.
Growing up in a place and then
having to leave must be awful.
I never had a proper home.
Twelve grand would have swung it,
and I almost made it once.
I had more than $5000 in my pocket...
...and Pampoon was running
in the Suburban.
I figured he couldn't lose.
I put it all on his nose.
He lost by a nose.
Drink your coffee, honey,
before it gets cold.
The way I figure,
my luck's just gotta turn.
One of these days, I'll make a real killing,
then I'm gonna head for home.
First thing I do, I take a bath in the creek
and get this city dirt off me.
- What's the matter?
- Nothing, Dix. Nothing.
- I say something wrong?
- No.
But, gee, this place is a mess.
It needs a good cleaning.
How can you stand to live like this?
Count it.
- Count it.
- Don't have to pay the whole tab at once.
Go ahead and count it.
Why get sore?
There's no reason to get sore.
You boned me in front of a stranger,
made me look small.
I didn't mean it.
I shoot my mouth off.
Maybe I had a slight load on.
You know how it is.
No, I don't know how it is.
Look, Dix...
...I made a mistake.
Don't you ever make a mistake? Sure.
Sure. Here, have a drink.
Here you are.
There you are, Dix.
You gotta play the horses the smart way.
Save your money.
The next time there's a fix,
I'll let you know. It'll be money from home.
Excuse me.
Oh, it's the Doc. Come on in, Doc.
Meet a friend of mine, Dix Handley.
This is Doc Riedenschneider.
You heard of him, I guess.
Yeah.
Well, how'd you like the whiskey?
Made in your home state.
Where is that, sir?
Kentucky. Boone County, Kentucky.
- Best water in the U.S.A.
- Is that so?
Yes, the water makes
the whiskey fit to drink.
Well...
...I gotta be going.
I'll see you around, maybe.
So long, Dix.
Big hick.
His money's all right,
but I wish he wasn't so touchy.
Maybe it's a point of honor with him.
A gambling debt.
Him, that hooligan? Honor?
Don't make me laugh.
- He's a hooligan?
- Yeah, but a smalltimer.
He'll stick up cigar stores, gas stations.
And every cent goes to the ponies.
One way or another,
we all work for our vice.
What do you say, Doc?
How was your date last night?
The young lady drank too much,
but the evening wasn't a complete loss.
- She talked more than if she'd been sober.
- Yeah? What about?
- Your friend Mr. Emmerich.
- Emmerich? Now, look here, Doc...
There's half a million at stake.
I've gotta know where I stand.
Emmerich must put up
before I can hire a crew.
For him, it's nothing. A dead cinch.
The information she gave me
is that he's broke.
Are you crazy?
I've seen him operate for 20 years.
He handles only the biggest cases.
He's got two houses, four cars,
half a dozen servants...
- And one blond.
- Doc, whose word you gonna take?
Mine or some dimwitted dame?
Yours, naturally.
If he's broke,
I wanna be broke the same way.
Lieutenant! Lieutenant!
That guy you saw in my office,
he's just passing through.
Shut up. I didn't see anybody.
How could I? I wasn't here.
Yeah, that's right. That's right.
- Look
- Yeah?
I came to tell you
you'll have to stand still for a raid.
- You mean they'll haul me downtown?
- It's a short ride.
I thought you were a friend of mine.
Right now I've got one friend: Ditrich.
And Ditrich's out on his ear
if he don't make a showing.
- Why me? Why pick on me?
- Because it's logic.
You're the biggest parlor in my precinct.
The citizens know it, the newspapers
know it and even I know it.
- And Mr. Commissioner knows I know it.
- I just hate to have it happen, that's all.
- I'm as sorry as you are.
- Look, lieutenant...
...I've always given you
plenty of cooperation...
...but you're hitting me
at just the wrong time.
Well, all right.
Close up tight.
Keep the place dark.
Don't answer any phones.
Thanks, lieutenant.
Thanks.
That copper, he recognized me.
- How'd you know he was a copper?
- I can smell one a block off.
Don't worry about Ditrich.
He's on my payroll.
Me and him, we're like that.
Experience taught me
never to trust a policeman.
Just when you think one's all right,
he turns legit.
- A Mr. Brannom is here.
- Oh, yes, show him in.
Pardon me, sir.
Mrs. Emmerich is not feeling well.
Yes, well...
...send for Dr. Houseman.
- I already have, sir.
Good.
Tell her
Say I'll be up to see her later.
Well, what about my debtors?
How many of them came through?
- Not a one.
- What's that?
You want all the excuses?
- I've got some beauts.
- It's as bad as that, eh?
Two or three may come through with a part.
- They promised.
- I don't want promises, I want cash.
Look, my friend, a private detective
can't go around threatening people.
I'd lose my license. Ninety-eight percent
of them you're gonna have to sue.
There's no time for that.
I gotta have money.
I've gotta have it this minute.
What is it, girl trouble?
Shut up, Brannom! That's not funny.
How's that?
Nobody tells me to shut up.
Sorry, Bob.
Bob, l...
I'm broke.
There. That's the plain, simple fact.
I'm finished. I'm bankrupt.
- How could you let Angela take you?
- It's not Angela.
It's everything. It's my whole way of life.
Every time I turn around, it costs thousands
of dollars. 10,000 here, 10,000 there.
I gotta... I gotta get out.
I gotta get out from under.
And the irony of it is
that I've got an opportunity...
...and I can't take it.
- Tough.
Bob...
...I'm gonna hand you
the shock of a lifetime.
Did you ever hear of
Doc Riedenschneider?
Sure. Behind the walls, isn't he?
No, he's out. He got out last week.
Cobby brought him to me.
He's got a plan, beautifully worked out...
...for the biggest caper ever to be pulled
in the Middle West.
Only, he wants $50,000 backing.
Who would be taken?
Belletier's.
The rocks alone would be worth,
conservatively speaking, half a million.
- How much would you get out of it?
- A third of the take.
Brother. You're knocking me out.
What if I were to tell you that I've got
a plan worked out to get it all?
I could tell them that I'd fence
the stuff myself, you see?
Promise them cash on delivery.
Then...
...when the time comes,
I simply wouldn't have the cash.
I'd tell them it'd take
a few days more to raise it.
I'm certain I could get them to leave
the stuff with me while we're waiting.
- Go on.
- Well, then I'd disappear.
I'd take a plane to another country,
to another life.
The gold and platinum I could melt up
and sell as bullion, you see.
And the rocks, sell them one at a time.
There'd be no hurry.
They'd last a lifetime.
How wrong can a guy be?
Here I was worrying about your nerves...
...and you were dreaming up
a double-cross like this.
Yes.
But I can't do it,
because I haven't got $50,000.
I can tell you how to raise it.
You? How?
- What's in it for me?
- Fifty-fifty.
Okay.
But we may get ourselves killed,
my friend.
Yes, I know.
- Well, how do we raise the money?
- Simple. Cobby.
- Cobby.
- Believe me.
He can dig it up without half-trying.
Yes.
But what do we tell him?
Why do I need money?
Leave it to me. Cobby wants to feel big.
Here's his chance.
Advancing money
for the great Alonzo P. Emmerich.
He'll do it.
He'll sweat, but he'll do it.
What boxes have you opened?
Cannonball, double door,
even a few fire chests. All of them.
- Can you open a vault with a time lock?
- Sure.
- What do you use, lock or seam?
- Seam.
Ever taken one?
- Remember the Shafter job?
- Yes, I heard about it behind the walls.
It was a good score.
- Who supplies your soup?
- I thrash it myself.
- How are you as a picklock?
- I can open anything in four minutes.
- He'll do.
- You're in.
Not so fast. What's the cut?
No cut. You get a flat guarantee.
- I want 30,000.
- 30,000? Now, Louis
Twenty-five is what we figured.
- All right, 15 down.
- Ten down.
Fifteen is satisfactory, I think.
There's your paymaster.
What are you sweating for?
Money makes me sweat, that's all.
It's the way I am.
- Who are the others on this job, Doc?
- Haven't got them yet.
There's only one driver,
as far as I'm concerned. Gus Minissi.
Ask Cobby, he knows him.
- Gus, 100 percent.
- Get hold of him.
- He'll take the heat and won't flap his lip.
- Get hold of him.
Sure, Doc.
Any ideas about a hooligan?
I know a very good heavy. I haven't
seen him in some time. Red Traynor.
- He's taking the cure.
- Rule him out.
What about Timmons?
- Who's that?
- My doorman.
That busted-down wrestler,
are you kidding?
He's got nothing upstairs
but solid knuckle.
I'm a stranger and do not know
as much as you gentlemen...
...but what about this southerner,
this Dix?
He impressed me as a very determined man
and far from stupid.
Frankly, I don't like the guy,
but I never saw a hooligan I did like.
They're like left-handed pitchers.
They all have a screw loose somewhere.
I suppose he's as good
as anybody, though.
Gus thinks he's tops,
and Gus is usually right.
I like him. I say we take him.
Suits me. You're the boss.
Well, I better be getting home now.
Mrs. Ciavelli's worried about the kid.
- What's the trouble?
- He's got a cold again.
She takes him out first thing
in the morning. It's cold then.
She claims a baby's gotta taste fresh air.
Like I'm always telling her, "If you want
fresh air, don't look for it in this town!"
Here.
He's 9 months old there.
I must say, I envy you,
being a family man.
Yeah.
Well, always problems, huh?
One good thing about Dix,
you can get him for nickels and dimes.
Tell me something, Cobby.
It's your money, isn't it?
Not Mr. Emmerich's.
- What difference does it make?
- None, really.
It's this way. Mr. Emmerich doesn't want
this transaction appearing in his books.
I'm not risking anything.
He's good for it in case of a runout.
Then you haven't got a worry.
No.
- Where are you going?
- I found a place.
A girlfriend's leaving town.
She let me have her apartment.
The rent's paid up
till the first of the month.
- When did this happen?
- This morning, before you woke up.
I bumped into her on the street.
Remember that tall brunette, used to do
the novelty dances at the Bandwagon?
Blanche LaRue. It sure was nice of her.
I can't go living off you forever, can I?
- I was glad to help out.
- Yeah.
Well, maybe I can do something
for you sometime.
You don't owe me a thing. Forget it.
Well
Goodbye.
- How are you fixed for dough?
- A couple of bucks. Enough.
Here, take this and...
No. No, thanks, Dix.
I'm all through bothering.
Give us a kiss, huh?
Doll.
Yes, Dix?
Maybe I'll wanna get in touch with you.
Sure, my new address.
I'll be at 42 Merton Street.
- Hello.
- Yeah.
- Oh, hiya, Cobby.
- Yeah.
Right.
Everything's here.
The soft spot's an old steam tunnel.
Manhole's on the corner.
You drop into the manhole at 11:45.
Dix will cover you.
You break through the wall.
It'll take about six minutes to get
into Belletier's from the furnace room.
Watch out for floor wires.
Make your way up the back stairs
and jump the alarm system.
That will take another three minutes.
At exactly 11:54,
Dix and I will come to the back door.
You open it for us.
- I'll be waiting for you.
- Good.
Any questions?
- Everything sounds okay.
- Same here.
Well, guess I better be getting home.
- How's the boy?
- Oh, he's okay.
Ran a temperature yesterday.
Pretty high too.
We called the doctor, but temperatures
don't mean so much with kids.
He's back to normal today.
- See you tomorrow night, 11:30.
- Good night.
Have you got a minute, Dix?
Sure. What's on your mind?
My friend, what do you know
about this fellow Emmerich?
You mean the big fixer?
I've heard his name, that's all.
- I can talk to you, I think.
- Sure.
Mr. Emmerich is taking the jewelry
off our hands.
You sure are surprising me, Doc.
I don't exactly trust Mr. Emmerich.
Just a feeling. I may be wrong.
But it's up to us to collect, you and me.
Everything may go smooth,
but if it don't
- lf he's got it, we'll collect.
- Good.
We'll meet Mr. Emmerich after the caper,
deliver the jewelry and get our money.
The payment is to be immediate
and in cash.
After that, we pay off and scatter.
Don't worry, Doc. We'll collect.
Lon...
...is that you?
- Lon?
- Yes, May.
Come in, Lon.
- I've got a business appointment.
- Sit down a minute.
It's 11:30. Isn't that
rather late for business?
- Lon.
- Yes, May?
I'm not feeling well.
You haven't been feeling well
for a long time.
At night, I get nervous.
And when I get nervous, I hate
to stay in this big house all by myself.
Look here. May, you're not alone.
There are three servants in the house.
- All you have to...
- I know. Press a button.
Well, what do you want me to do?
Sit down, Lon.
All right.
Do I sit here and watch you
read a magazine?
- Would that be so awful?
- Oh, now, look, May...
We could play cards.
- Casino, like we used to.
- Some other night.
Please, Lon, just one hand.
I couldn't sleep last night.
Then I got to thinking of the old days...
...how we used to like to stay up
and play casino. Just the two of us.
Yes. I wish I could stay, but I can't.
My dear, this is business.
I tell you what I'll do.
I'll look in later, and if you're still awake,
we'll have a little game.
Take your keys, please. We're closing up.
Okay.
- All set?
- Yeah.
Better be careful
how you handle this stuff.
They'll pick you up in little pieces.
What time have you got?
Good.
Good luck, Doc.
Did he give you the soup?
Here's the electric eye.
Soup.
It's gonna take a lot to blow this baby.
Here goes.
- What's that?
- Keep going.
Hey, Doc, alarms are going off
all over the block.
- The blast must've shook the whole system.
- What do we do?
I would hate to leave now.
We're so close.
- I'm for finishing what we started.
- How about you, Louis?
- It's okay with me.
- Will Gus hold still?
Don't worry about Gus.
What's the matter?
The drill broke.
We should finish before 12:15,
before the watchman gets here.
The store cop? Let me worry about him.
- Hear that, Dix?
- Yeah.
- Coming this way?
- From the river. Don't sound good.
Take a look, see what's happening.
We gotta blow, fast!
This is everything of real value.
- Heavy, ain't she?
- Plenty.
This is the biggest one yet.
Wait till you see it in the papers.
Watchman. Pull open the door, Louis.
- Maybe he'll go away.
- Do what Dix says.
Now.
Follow me.
- Gus, take me home.
- Where did it get you?
Thigh. I can feel it going up.
I think I got the slug in my belly.
- I'll take you to a guy, used to be a doctor.
- No, no. Take me home, Gus!
All right, Louis.
It's after 1.
They should be here any minute.
Unless there's been trouble.
Where is Angela tonight?
She's at her sister's.
She says.
I'd go easy on that liquor if I were you.
Half-drunk, I got better wits
than most people.
And more nerve.
You look worried, my friend.
Something bothering you?
Live and learn.
All these years, I've been suffering
from an inferiority complex.
I should've been in the money
years ago.
You big boys, what have you got?
Front. Nothing but front.
And when that slips
I do believe our guests are arriving.
Well? Everything go all right?
This is a friend of mine, Mr. Brannom.
He's been a great help to me
on this deal.
Follow me. Follow me, gentlemen.
It's much more comfortable in here.
Say, I'll bet that thing is full
of Koh-i-noors and Grand Moguls, eh?
Could be.
Sit down, gentlemen. Sit down.
- Let me get you a drink.
- No, thanks.
Do you mind if we have a look?
You're entitled to a look, naturally.
- Convinced?
- Why, of course. Of course.
There never was any doubt in my mind.
You know, I know this fellow's reputation.
Just a matter of curiosity, that's all.
I'll bet the appraisal is going to exceed
even your estimate...
Good. Good.
In that case, I'd just like to see
the color of the money.
Gentlemen, I must admit
at this moment I
I'm embarrassed.
- You mean you haven't got the money?
- Oh, I have it.
- That is, I have the assurance of it.
- You haven't got it.
No, I haven't got the currency
right here in my hands...
...but it's promised
by an unimpeachable source.
Gentlemen, I'm afraid we were
a little hasty. We moved too fast.
We moved on your word.
Wait a minute.
That's a large sum of money, you know...
...considering present-day conditions...
...and considering the fact
that we had to have it in cash.
So I'm afraid a few days more
are needed to raise it.
A few days more may not seem like
a very long time to you, Mr. Emmerich.
But to me, carrying this around,
it would seem like years.
I understand.
I've got a solution for that too.
That is, if you boys trust me.
And if you don't, well, there's nothing
I can say except that I'm sorry.
Mr. Emmerich,
what are you trying to tell us?
About the jewels.
Wouldn't be safe for you
to carry that stuff around.
You mean, we leave them with you?
Well, when the police start looking
for that stuff tomorrow morning...
...they're not likely to call me up.
They're not likely to send detectives out
to search my house, you know.
You, on the other hand, Doc, you
You're just out of prison.
They're certainly gonna be looking
for the big-timers like yourself.
Some smart cop might even connect
this burglary with your release.
Well, there you are.
Of course, as I said, it's up to you.
Keep in touch with me through Cobby.
You did a great job, Emmerich,
but it's not working.
- Bob!
- Back away and keep out of this, Emmerich.
Now, you, farmer, get your hands up.
And you, Fritz...
...throw the bag on the floor.
Over here by my feet.
Be careful how you throw it.
I got a pistol expert medal.
- What do you say, Dix?
- He's got no say.
He makes a crooked move,
he'll never pitch another forkful of manure.
He's got us, Doc. Toss him the bag.
You're not as dumb as you look.
Are you a man or what?
Trying to gyp and double-cross me
with no guts for it.
What's inside of you?
What's keeping you alive?
Why don't you kill me?
- What's stopping you?
- Okay, mister...
Dix, listen to me. Don't kill him.
It's too easy an out for him.
Sit down, sir.
Whatever possessed you
to pull such a stunt?
I was broke, facing bankruptcy.
He's a witness.
He saw me knock off that guy.
- You think he wouldn't holler?
- He's in no position to talk.
What did you and your man on the floor
intend to do with the jewels?
Leave town.
Sell them off a little at a time.
No good. The police would have been
on you after the first sale.
You can't go peddling stuff like this around
when the heat's on.
Let's not fool around here any longer.
Be patient, Dix.
Mr. Emmerich got us into this hole,
and he's going to get us out.
I didn't save your life
because I'm a lover of humanity.
We're in trouble with
this satchel full of jewels.
As things stand, it's just so much junk.
- There's nothing I can do.
- Yes, there is, Mr. Emmerich.
You can go to the insurance company.
- Insurance company?
- They'll listen to reason.
This is a very bad jolt for them.
It's possible they'll be willing to buy
the jewels back, no questions asked...
...for as high as 25 percent
of what they're worth.
Doc, let's blow.
I'll start on it tomorrow.
Get busy, Emmerich.
And remember, you might have been
lying here dead with your friend.
Shall I get in touch with you
through Cobby?
No. I'll get in touch with you.
Come on, Dix.
I advise you to clean up after your friend.
- Don't give him any water.
- He asked for it.
- I said, don't give him any water.
- Let go.
You wanna kill him?
Maybe he's hurt in the stomach.
Where's the doctor?
Why doesn't he come?
You said 10 minutes. It's half an hour.
Louis will die.
Why can't I take him to the hospital?
They wheel him into an operating room,
you'll never see him again.
Take it easy, Maria.
Louis is gonna be all right.
The doctor will be here,
fix him up good as new.
You and Louis are gonna have
six more kids.
All as fat as pigs, big black eyes,
lots of hair.
Just like Louis, eh, Maria?
Stay away from the baby!
Tell me the truth.
How did it happen?
- I told you. A fight.
- Louis don't fight. You know that.
Why is it always you?
Whenever Louis gets into trouble,
you're around.
You dirty cripple! You crooked-back!
- You have the evil eye!
- Shut your mouth, Maria!
I don't let anybody say that to me.
I'm sorry, Gus...
...but I gotta blame somebody.
What I carry on my back,
I was born with it.
I didn't grow it myself.
Please forgive me, Gus. I didn't mean it.
- Listen to that.
- Yeah. Must be a fire.
It's not in this neighborhood, though.
Someplace else.
Oh, Gus. I pray to God
that doctor get here quick.
He'll be here any minute, Maria.
Sounds like a soul in hell.
Dix, why don't you get in touch with Gus
and let him take you to the doctor.
- Don't be foolish.
- I don't like doctors.
I'm getting along all right.
That bullet just ripped through my side
and went on about its business.
- Good thing I jumped.
- How can things go so wrong?
How is it possible?
One man killed,
two others plugged.
I'm out 30 grand. We got a load
of rocks we can't even peddle.
Quit crying and get me some bourbon.
I must be awful stupid.
Here I am with
a good business...
...money rolling in...
...I gotta get mixed up
in a thing like this.
I ought to have
my head examined.
Yeah, hello, hello.
Yeah, this is Cobby.
What?
It's Gus. Dragnet's out,
and they're combing the district.
He wants to talk to you.
You, Dix.
Gus? Dix.
Yeah. Listen careful.
Cops are knocking over joints along
the boulevard, meat wagons and all.
Now, look, I already called a guy,
Eddie Donato.
Donato's got a grocery down by the river.
Louis is not so good. He got a slug
in his belly. Doc's doing all he can.
Here they are now,
the happiness boys.
Hello. How are you?
Looks like I'm in for a working-over.
Look. Go down to Eddie's
by way of the old car barn.
It's deserted at night.
You get beyond that, you're okay.
Cops never bother Eddie's neighborhood.
So long, Dix. Blow now.
All right, all right, all right.
What? Please talk a little louder.
This is Eddie Donato.
Oh, sure, sure.
I'll get Doc for you.
Hey, , I got your man.
Hello.
Yes.
Fine, fine.
Good.
That will be satisfactory.
- Cobby?
- Yes.
Emmerich came through.
The insurance people say okay.
Of course, we have to wait
till the banks open Monday morning.
But it's 250,000, which is not bad.
- What's the matter?
- As a lawyer, you may be very brilliant.
But as a casino player,
you have a lot to learn.
- You don't mind if I smoke, do you?
- Of course not, Lon.
Lon, how could you make
a play like that?
You won't make
a single point this hand.
- Come in.
- Two gentlemen to see you, sir.
They are from the police department.
What on earth could they want, Lon?
Well, something to do
with a case, I suppose.
- Excuse me?
- Oh, bother. We were having so much fun.
- Hurry back.
- Sure.
- Yes?
- Sorry to disturb you, Mr. Emmerich.
I'm Andrews.
This is Officer Janocek.
- How do you do?
- How are you?
Well, what can I do for you?
Do you know a man
named Robert Brannom?
Brannom. Yes, of course.
What is it?
Something the matter?
There sure is, Mr. Emmerich.
His body was pulled
out of the river this morning.
- Great heavens.
- But it was no drowning.
He had a hole through his pump.
He'd been shot.
Will you step in here for a minute?
Well, I must say, this is
It's quite a shock.
Bob Brannom, eh?
Murdered, you say?
Great heavens.
We found a list of names in his pocket
written on your business stationery.
- Who are these people, do you know?
- Oh, that's a list of my debtors.
Brannom was working for me.
He was trying to collect old debts...
...without much success, I must say.
Was he giving the treatment
to anybody on this list?
Certainly not.
Then you don't think there's any connection
between this work for you and his death?
- None whatever.
- When did you see him last?
Well, now, last Wednesday evening,
in this room.
Yes. We went over that list together.
The coroner says he was plugged
at 1:00 or 2:00 this morning.
Not much after the Belletier job was pulled.
We figured there
might be a connection.
One of the heist guys was shot,
we know that.
There was blood on the floor.
Maybe it was Brannom's.
He could've died in the car,
they dropped him in the river.
Oh, no, no. Bob Brannom's a good deal
of a roughneck, but he's no criminal.
And if I'm any judge, Belletier's was
the work of bigtime professionals.
Oh, no, no, gentlemen.
Bob Brannom mixed up in any burglary...
...why, that's inconceivable.
I see.
Oh, one more thing, Mr. Emmerich.
Just for the records, of course.
Could you give us an account
of your whereabouts last night?
Yes, I could.
Why? Is it necessary?
I'm afraid so, Mr. Emmerich.
Well, boys, a man of my years
hates to make an admission like this...
...but a Miss Phinlay is living
in my cottage on the river.
And last night, I went to visit her
at about 11:30, I think it was.
Stayed rather late.
Oh, she'll verify this, of course.
Oh, but boys...
...use a little discretion, eh?
Unless, of course, it serves
some useful purpose.
I understand, Mr. Emmerich,
and thank you very much for your help.
Oh, not at all. Thank you.
And say, if I can be any further help,
you just call on me.
- Good day.
- Good day.
- Hello, Angela?
- This is Lon.
?
Listen, baby,
you may have a visit from the police.
?
- No, no. It's nothing like that.
They'll probably ask you
some questions about last night.
Now, listen, baby.
I want you to tell them
that I was there with you...
...from 11:30 until 3 in the morning.
- Most of the night, that's right.
- Now, is that clear?
Yes. Oh, no, no. Just politics, baby.
- Good old dirty politics.
- Yes, I'll call you later.
Yes.
Can we go on playing?
Certainly. Why not?
Why, Lon, you're as pale as a ghost.
What's the matter?
Well, I just had some bad news.
A man who works for me got killed.
Oh, Lon, how awful.
Was it an accident?
No.
No. It was...
...an intentional killing.
- Do they know who did it?
- No.
Oh, Lon, when I think of all those
awful people you come in contact with...
...downright criminals,
I get scared.
Oh, there's nothing's
so different about them.
After all, crime is only...
...a left-handed form
of human endeavor.
- Ever been in Mexico City, Dix?
- Nope.
It's 8000 feet up.
The air is very pure.
Many first-class clubs,
restaurants, a horse track...
...and girls.
Beautiful young girls.
How would you like to go there,
all expenses paid?
Sorry, Doc, not interested.
I'm heading home.
Listen, Dix.
You can always go home.
And when you do, it's nothing.
Believe me. I've done it. Nothing.
My mind's made up.
It's me.
Look, my friends.
My friends...
...I am a respectable man.
For Gus, I do a favor, all right?
With this picture in the paper...
You mean you want us to blow?
Is that right, Eddie? Okay.
The sooner we get out of here,
the better.
Eddie's getting to the place where
he'd talk with encouragement.
Oh, no. I no talk.
Gus cut my belly open.
I'm sorry, my friends,
to bring you this bad news.
- I go now, please.
- Sit down, Donato.
You're not going anyplace till I say so.
Stay put, Eddie.
Nobody's gonna hurt you, so long as you
sit still and keep your mouth shut.
The way I figure, the insurance guys sicced
the cops on that phony, and he spilled.
You never should've stopped me
from blasting him.
No, Dix. He hasn't spilled...
...or they wouldn't be looking for just me.
- Then how come?
Because there's only three or four men
who can manage a job like this.
Somebody in the department with
a few brains has decided I'm the guy.
I've been half-expecting it.
It doesn't worry me much.
We'll get our money tomorrow, you bet.
I hope so.
- Where are we going, Dix?
- I know a place.
Eddie, if you're a smart boy,
you'll forget you ever seen us.
- I wanna see the commissioner.
- State your business.
I'm a citizen. I can see the
commissioner if I want to, can't I?
- Is it about Riedenschneider?
- Could be.
He sure gets around, that guy.
About 5000 people have seen him
in the last 24 hours.
If you get in that line and wait your turn,
you can tell your story.
- I won't tell anybody but the commissioner.
- Okay. Sit down and wait, buddy.
- But it may be some time.
- Okay.
I'd like to see the commissioner.
Where do you think you're going?
- We're on our way home.
- Yeah?
- Where do you live?
- South on Camden.
You got no business here.
This is city property. There are signs.
- Everybody uses it.
- You're telling me.
Even hoodlums have been
bringing girls here.
- Is that a fact?
- Yeah.
It's cost one of our boys his job,
on account of the beefs.
If I were you, I'd stay out of here.
You understand?
Okay, officer.
Hey, wait a minute.
You, with the bag.
Come here.
Dix!
Oh, Dix, honey.
You'll have to excuse me.
I took a couple of sleeping pills,
and I guess I'm still kind of groggy.
I haven't been able
to sleep much lately, Dix...
...worrying about you
and everything.
I was up at your place.
They told me the cops
were after you.
Get me some cold water
and some towels and stop yapping.
Sure, Dix. Sure.
- Get a move on.
- Oh, you bet.
Put in hours and hours of planning.
Figure everything down
to the last detail. Then what?
Burglar alarms start going off
all over the place for no sensible reason.
A gun fires of its own accord,
and a man is shot.
A broken-down old harness bull,
no good for anything but chasing kids...
...has to trip over us.
Blind accident.
What can you do against blind accident?
One thing I ought to have
figured was Emmerich.
I know why I didn't.
I'm not kidding myself.
It was the extra dough he promised.
I got hungry.
Greed made me blind.
Hey, Dix. Dix, isn't he the one
with the reward on him?
Mind your own business.
She confirmed what Emmerich said,
that he was with her from 11:30 till 3.
- How did she impress you?
- Very much.
- She's some babe.
- That's not what I mean.
Was her manner straightforward?
Oh, I guess she was
telling the truth, all right.
Married 20 years,
consorting with a woman...
...young enough to be his granddaughter.
It's disgusting.
But nothing about Emmerich
would surprise me.
Educated man who uses brains
to circumvent the law.
Worst type of human being.
No excuse for him.
- Excuse me, commissioner.
- Well?
There's a taxi driver
been waiting outside.
- Says he's got some important information.
- Concerning what?
I tried to find out, but he
wouldn't talk to anyone but you.
He's been waiting two hours.
- All right, send him in.
- Yes, sir.
- What's your name?
- Charles Wright.
Hackie number 14803.
Green Stripe Company.
- What's this information you've got?
- That doctor everybody's looking for.
- I think I had him for a fare.
- You drove him someplace?
Well, now, I'm pretty sure it was him I
picked up at the station a week ago Friday.
Friday the 16th?
Where did you take him?
To a number on Camden West.
I remember I asked him
if he wanted me to wait.
I know a fella that got
rolled once on Camden West.
He didn't have nothing,
so they stole his pants.
Where did you take him?
What number?
It was dark.
- What's that number again?
- 4717.
Used to be a bookie joint, commissioner.
Get hold of Lieutenant Ditrich.
Yeah, that's him.
At first I thought I was making
a fool of myself by coming down here.
But that's him, all right.
You may be in for a reward.
I hope so.
- Where are you, Ditrich?
All right. Now, get a search warrant
and go to 4717 Camden West.
- Riedenschneider was seen there.
Yeah.
Stake your men out before
you go in. Get a move on.
Some news just came in.
A patrolman was on duty at the car barn.
He ran into two men and was slugged.
They got away, but he identified one
as Riedenschneider.
Good. Great.
We'll block off the whole area.
No sirens. We'll make it a sneak.
How about the patrolman? Badly hurt?
A head wound and he's punchy.
The doctor doesn't
think he's got a fracture.
Well, son, looks like maybe
we're getting somewhere at last.
Look, lieutenant,
what would I know about Belletier's?
I wouldn't mix into a robbery.
You know that.
- Wouldn't you?
- No, of course not!
You saw Riedenschneider here, sure.
- That don't say...
- You're nuts.
Never seen anybody here.
How could I?
I never been here before this.
Well, that being the case...
...what's to connect me
with the Belletier job?
Somebody saw him here.
I don't know who.
Maybe you got a fink around.
Look. You're sure you
won't have one, lieutenant?
No, thanks.
I never drink while on duty.
It's against regulations.
Look, I got nothing to hide.
Riedenschneider holed up here.
He was broke.
I let him use one of the rooms
for a couple days.
I got tired of having him around.
I gave him a few bucks to get rid of him.
- Where did he go?
- I don't know.
I don't know.
Look, Cobby, do you figure me
for a pal, or don't you?
I sure do, lieutenant.
Then take my advice and turn state's.
We'll make a deal
with the commissioner.
- You won't get more than a year or two.
- Look, I'm clean.
I don't know where he went.
That's the truth.
They won't believe
you at headquarters.
When you tell them that,
they'd work you over.
You ain't the type that can take it.
You'd spill your guts in a half-hour.
Give me a break.
You came to make a pinch, sure.
But I'm not here.
I had to go to Chi on business.
You're right here, Cobby.
I've always treated you right, lieutenant.
Let me duck out.
- You can get away with it.
- No, I couldn't.
The commissioner's mad.
He's out for blood.
And it's not going to be mine.
You're not gonna stop me!
You're gonna let me go!
You're gonna do that!
If you don't...
Yeah, I know.
You'll be a Grade A pigeon.
That's right. I'll tell them
you saw Riedenschneider here...
...and didn't roust him. Why?
You'd have to explain
what you were doing here.
I'll tell them about the juice
you've been getting.
The only thing you're doing
is making me sore.
Once I start singing, I won't stop!
They'll jug you right alongside of me!
That's where you're wrong.
Even if they believe you,
it won't go too hard with me.
Because I'll be the guy that cracked
the biggest case ever pulled in the country.
- You're gonna get hurt, Cobby.
- What, have you gone crazy?
Stand up!
I told you you couldn't take it, Cobby.
Here.
They'll call me a fink.
That's my boy.
So since I'm gonna be
busy with a lot of cases...
...you might like to take a trip.
- Where to?
I don't know. The coast, Florida.
Anywhere you like.
Could I, Uncle Lon?
Anywhere? No fooling?
Yes. I think a change of scenery
might be good for you.
Wait. You wait right here.
I've got the most terrific idea.
Oh, Cuba. There, that's not a bad idea.
Imagine me on this beach here
in my green bathing suit.
I almost bought a white one,
but it wasn't extreme enough.
If I really went in for the extreme extreme,
I would have bought a French one.
Run for your lives, girls.
The fleet's in.
Oh, Uncle Lon, am I excited!
Look, Uncle Lon. Isn't it romantic?
Real palms and ocean and everything!
Who can that be this time of night?
See who it is, Uncle Lon.
Why are they pounding so?
I'm scared, Uncle Lon.
Well, young man,
you've got an iron fist...
Oh, hello, Hardy. Come in.
Well, there's a fire in here.
Come on in. You look cold.
I'm here to arrest you, Emmerich.
May I ask what for?
Complicity in robbery and in murder.
If I were you, Hardy,
I'd think up a few more charges.
You might make
one of them stand up...
...if you get an imbecile jury
and the right judge.
- Get the young lady.
- Yes, sir.
It may interest you to know that your
friend Cobb has signed a confession.
Want to take a look at it? Here.
Okay, miss. It's a shame to bust
this door in, but here goes.
Haven't you bothered me enough,
you big banana-head?
Just try breaking my door,
and Mr. Emmerich will throw you out.
Afraid not, miss.
He's got troubles enough.
As a matter of fact, he's a dead duck.
Hurry up, Andrews.
Bring the young lady in here.
Do I have to talk to him?
Couldn't I just talk to you?
Come on, baby.
Get it over with.
And be smart.
Tell the commissioner the truth.
That's the only thing to do.
Come on.
Sit down.
Andrews, repeat the statement Miss Phinlay
made before you yesterday afternoon.
She said Mr. Emmerich was here with her
from 11:30 p.m. To 3 a.m. Last Friday night.
Is that the statement you made?
- Yes, sir.
- Was it the truth?
You better think before you answer...
...unless you wanna go to jail.
- Jail?
For setting up a false alibi to keep
another from being punished for a crime.
- Mr. Emmerich wouldn't commit a crime.
- He would and did.
Tell him the truth.
- Uncle Lon.
- It's the only thing to do...
...unless you want to be indicted
for obstructing justice.
What I said yesterday was
Well, it wasn't exactly...
I mean...
- It wasn't really the...
- Was it the truth?
No, sir.
- You weren't with Emmerich, were you?
- No, sir.
- You were someplace else, not with him.
- Yes, sir.
He told you what to say,
made you learn it by heart.
Answer me!
I mean, yes, sir!
I mean, I learned it by heart!
Get a new statement from her.
Have her sign it.
This time, young lady,
I want the whole truth.
Over here, miss.
I'm sorry, Uncle Lon.
I tried.
You did pretty well, considering.
What about my trip, Uncle Lon?
Is it still on?
Don't worry, baby.
You'll have plenty of trips.
Seems to be all wrapped up, Emmerich.
Oh, here.
Say, I'd like to telephone my wife,
if you don't mind.
Getting late. She might be worried.
Help yourself. But don't try to run.
You won't get very far.
Emmerich!
- Stop! Stop!
- Come on!
- You wait and see...
- Break loose!
You dirty fink. You're gonna
wind up where you belong.
You're gonna wind up in the morgue!
You wait and see, you dirty fink!
Home of the pigeons!
Fink! Fink!
Fire escape.
We're looking for Louis Ciavelli.
I'd consider it a great favor
if you didn't insist on going in.
Mrs. Ciavelli is, well,
I don't have to tell you.
If the father says it's okay,
Williams, it's okay.
- Call the commissioner's office.
- The commissioner knows me.
- Mention my name. Sortino.
- Thank you, Father.
"Emmerich was a graduate of
the law college of State University...
...and had practiced here
for over 25 years."
What foolishness. Unbelievable.
He wouldn't have gotten
more than two years.
He even double-crossed himself.
How's your head, Doc?
Good as it ever was,
which isn't saying much.
You know, getting out of town's
not gonna be a cinch for you.
Oh, I'll get out, all right.
I'll take a taxi to the edge of town,
then have him drive me as far as Cleveland.
Sure you wouldn't come
along with me, Dix?
Keep it.
No, thank you.
If you won't come,
will you finance me?
I haven't got but 4 or 5 dollars.
Sure, I'll finance you.
How much you need?
I can get along on $ 1000,
thanks very much.
And you can have
the rest of these stones.
That's $50,000 worth.
What would I do? Can you see me
walking into a hockshop with that stuff?
First they'd think they were phony,
then they'd yell for the riot squad.
No. You can have the thousand,
but no rocks for me.
Well, thank you, Dix.
Tell me where to write you. At least I can
send you the 5 grand you got coming.
- What will your address be in Kentucky?
- Forget it.
Maybe I'll see you around.
Well...
...goodbye, then.
- Goodbye, Doc.
Hey, wait. You haven't got a heater.
I'd let you have mine,
but you got a gun, Doll?
No, Dix. I used to have one around,
but I guess somebody stole it.
I don't want a gun.
I haven't carried a gun since my 20s.
You carry a gun, you shoot a policeman.
Bad rap, hard to beat.
You don't carry a gun,
you give up and they hold one on you.
All right, Doc. You know best.
How about a cup of coffee, honey?
That squarehead.
He's a funny little guy.
I don't get him at all.
Maybe it's because he's a foreigner.
They just don't think like us.
I gotta get out of town too,
before morning.
Anyway, he's got plenty of guts.
- How about a cup of coffee, honey?
- Make it or shut up about it.
- It's that wound.
- Bright girl.
Dix, it's starting to bleed again.
I know, aspirin.
Pickering Avenue and Center Street.
You know where that is?
- The other side of town.
- How far is that?
- I can make it in an hour.
- Okay. I got relatives living there.
I'm between trains.
I got nothing else to do.
I know how it is.
I got relatives myself, on both sides.
Always writing me letters for money.
I haven't spoken German for a long time.
- You have a  accent.
- I was born there.
You know what they say,
"Home is where the money is."
- Yeah.
- Franz?
- Would you drive me to Cleveland?
- It's a long way, my friend.
But it would still be quicker
than to take the train.
- What about your relatives?
- Forget them.
Well, I don't know.
Cleveland, that's a long way.
- Costs a lot of money.
- There's a $50 tip for you.
- What do you say?
- For $50, I'd drive you to the North Pole.
Well, we better get gas
if we're going to Cleveland.
Let's not stop.
Wait till we get out of town.
We can do everything at once.
Have a little meal, beer, a cigar.
Go in comfort.
You're a man who likes
his pleasures.
Well, Franz, what else
is there in life, I ask you?
You've been gone two hours.
What happened?
It took time.
I was stopped twice, prowler cars.
The neighborhood's
crawling with coppers. Dix, you...
- Did you get a car?
- Yes.
Here's the change.
It only came to $400.
I got it from Big Vivian.
It's in pretty good shape, Dix, except...
- Did you put gas in it?
- Yes.
- Where is it parked?
- Three blocks away.
- Good girl.
- Dix.
- Yeah?
- I'm scared.
All those cops out there.
They don't worry me one bit.
I'll drive slow. Head down
the main boulevard, and in 10 hours...
...I'll be home.
How are you gonna
drive all that way?
- I'll make it.
- No!
Not in the shape you're in.
- I'll make it!
- Dix.
Let me go with you?
Please, Dix. Please.
Are you crazy? I'm on the lam.
I'm wanted bad, packing heat.
- What good would you be?
- I could drive!
No, Doll. I'm wanted on a killing rap.
I don't care.
I just want to be with you.
You can't go without me.
I won't let you.
I won't tell you where the car is.
I don't get it.
I just don't get it.
All right, kid. Get your things packed.
Come on, let's play some more.
I'm fresh out of nickels, Jeannie.
How about you?
- I'm always fresh out.
- Well, get some.
You know, you can cost a guy
a lot of dough.
Nickels he's complaining about.
What a spender.
Sure, he wants a date.
He always wants a date.
And where do we go?
To a third-run movie.
Then we take a ride
and blow two tires.
Then we come in here,
and what do you treat me to? Cokes.
- That's for you.
- Thanks.
- Would you have change for this in nickels?
- Sure thing.
At least you could dig for enough
to play me some music.
Jeannie, cut it out.
Excuse me, boys.
Young lady, I like music too.
- Would you play me a tune?
- Sure. What do you want?
- You pick them.
- Gosh, how many have you got here?
- Not very many. Play what you like.
- Okay.
Mister.
Mister. It's getting late.
Mister, we better be moving along.
Plenty of time, my friend. Plenty of time.
Look, mister, it's a long way to Cleveland.
Well, I suppose we better go now.
- Don't go. We haven't used all the nickels.
- You use them.
- Thanks. It's sure nice of you.
- Don't mention it.
Goodbye and thanks.
Thanks ever so much.
Pleasure was all mine.
You men want something?
What do you think, Ed?
Might be the number-one boy.
- Just might be.
- Say, what is this?
- Shut up.
- Better frisk him.
- Go right ahead.
- Put up your hands.
You have me mixed up with somebody else.
I'm from Cleveland, the importing business.
My name's Kremper.
Nothing there.
Let me see that coat.
- You're making a big...
- Shut up. Stay out of this.
Bill, better phone the city
and check on the description.
We don't need a description.
I'll tell them we got him.
- Okay, mister. Keep those hands up.
- Of course.
Excuse me, officer,
but will you tell me something?
Maybe. Just keep your face front.
How long have you been out here?
- That's a darn funny question.
- It's not important.
We've been watching you
through that window two, three minutes.
Yes. Say, about as long as it takes
to play a phonograph record.
How's that again?
What are you talking about?
- It doesn't matter.
- Keep your face front.
You mind if I smoke a cigar?
Just stand quiet there, mister.
We'll talk about smoking a cigar later.
Certainly, officer. Certainly.
How you feeling now, Dix?
All right. Cold.
Didn't used to get cold this time of year.
Why don't you let me drive
for a while, honey.
You don't know the way.
I don't wanna have to keep telling you.
Much longer, Dix?
Dix. Dix.
Dix!
Dix.
Mister! Mister!
Mister!
You gotta help me.
I gotta find a doctor.
My husband, he's sick.
Come on. I'll show you.
Go straight on, ma'am.
Down to the end of the block.
We'll get Doc Swanson.
He lives right near here, on Elm Street.
My husband, he's sick. Save him!
Get him inside here where I can look at him.
Right in this other room here, please.
On the table.
Take his coat off.
On the chair.
This man's been hemorrhaging.
He's lost a lot of blood. What happened?
He was hurt.
He was hurt in an auto accident.
- How long has this wound been let go?
- A couple of days.
Is it bad, doctor?
Is he hurt real bad?
It's not good.
- You got a good, strong arm?
- Good as any, Doc, I guess.
Come around here
and hold this for me, please.
That's right.
There we are.
Hello. Let me talk to Tom.
This is Dr. Swanson. Well, wake him up!
- I'm thirsty. Get me a drink of water.
- Sure, Dix. Sure.
Lie down, sweetheart. Please lie down.
Hello, sheriff.
This is Tom. I got a man here
with a gunshot wound. Pretty bad.
- Here, sweetheart.
- Who's that?
I had to take you to the doctor's, Dix.
I couldn't help it.
Hold him? I don't have to.
The man's unconscious.
No, no, no. He's a stranger to me.
His wife's with him.
She says it was an auto accident.
Dix.
Dix. Dix!
Well, he won't get very far,
that's for sure.
He hasn't got enough blood left in him
to keep a chicken alive.
- Any more questions?
- I don't like to harp on the same point...
...but what about Ditrich?
If the past of the department...
He's in jail and he'll go to trial.
He'll be tried by 12 citizens.
The people he's worked for. Let them
show justice or compassion as they see fit.
- What would be your verdict, commissioner?
- I'm not sure.
I'm not sure at all.
Let me put it this way.
It's not anything strange that there
are corrupt officers in police departments.
The dirt they're trying to clean up
is bound to rub off on some, but not all.
Maybe one out of 100.
The other 99 are honest men
trying to do an honest job.
- Listen.
I know you're police reporters
and hear this all day...
...but listen with your conscience,
not just your ears.
We send police assistance
to each of those calls...
...because they're not just codes
on a radio, they're cries for help.
People are being cheated,
robbed, murdered, raped.
And that goes on 24 hours a day,
every day in the year.
And that's not exceptional, that's usual.
It's the same in every city
of the modern world.
But suppose we had no police force,
good or bad.
Suppose we had...
...just silence.
Nobody to listen. Nobody to answer.
The battle's finished.
The jungle wins.
The predatory beasts take over.
Think about it.
Well, gentlemen...
...three men are in jail, three men dead, one
by his own hand. One man's a fugitive...
...and we have reason to believe
seriously wounded.
That's six out of seven. Not bad.
And we'll get the last one too.
In some ways,
he's the most dangerous of them all.
A hardened killer. A hooligan.
A man without human feeling
or human mercy.
I tell you...
...the black one's the best
we ever had at Hickorywood.
The bay's all right, but...
...the black's a real good colt.
Prettiest way of
Going of Anything...
...Pa ever bred.
Easiest thing...
...but he's always way out front...
...of the other yearlings.
He's a stake horse...
...or I never saw one.
I sure hope...
...Pa don't sell him.
If Pa just hangs on to that black colt...
...everything's gonna be all right.
- Oh, Dix. God!
I said it.
I'll say it again.
If Pa just hangs on to that black colt...
...everything's gonna be okay.
What's this...?
Oh, Dix!
Dix! Dix!
Oh, God. Oh, my God, Dix.
Dix.
