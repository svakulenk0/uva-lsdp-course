Zeberdee, it's Bill.
What? How am I?
What do you mean, "how am I"?
I'm fuckin' buzzin'!
We've gone right through the slit.
Keep your fuckin' nut down.
He's a right fuckin' stringer, this kid.
- What's he say?
- Nothing.
- What do you mean, "nothing"?
- He fuckin' hung up.
Raff, call Tommy.
Find out where he is.
There's a pub on the corner called
the Ship and Billet. Head for that.
I'll have to bell you back,
Harris is trying to get through.
Just spotted their little firm
going to a pub in Denbigh Street.
They won't know what's fuckin' hit 'em.
There you are.
Here, come here!
- Sweet, Bill?
- Yeah.
- Where's the others?
- On their way.
- Harris said there's about 25 of the others.
- There won't be when we've finished with 'em.
Wait round the corner!
What for?
Cos it's all going to be on top,
us all standin' here, you si.
- Jog on.
- Jog on!
Bill, it's Harris.
Hello, son. Yeah?
All right. See you there.
What happened to you last night?
Thought you was coming out for a drink?
Johnson had me on some nutty skunk.
Ended up down the petrol garage
at two o'clock in the morning.
What you driving for?
You're on a ban, you lunatic.
Ban? What am I gonna do, walk?
Here he is.
Right, there's someone
outside the pub.
- How old is he?
- He's only a kid.
Go on, crack him.
Keep the noise down.
- Excuse me, mate, you got a light?
- Don't fuck about, ping him.
Let's go!
It's going good anyway.
Let's settle it.
- Come on, let's...
- Keep it down, keep it down.
- Keep it down.
- Fuckin' hell, come on, boys.
Keep it down, keep it down.
- Come on. Fuckin' hell.
- Keep it down.
Don't fuck this up.
Fuckin' clowns won't stop us.
You're fuckin' animals!
You give this fuckin' country
a bad fuckin' name!
You ain't no football supporters!
You're fuckin' muggy little cunts!
How fuckin' perfect was that?
Soppy bollocks here even managed to get
the canister inside the fuckin' pub this time.
Do you remember that time at Upton...
That time at Upton Park,
he let it off on the tube!
Mind you, premature ejaculation,
that's right up your fuckin' street!
Anyway, he's virtually throwing 'em
out of the fuckin' pub at me, right?
He's throwing 'em out of the fuckin' pub at me.
Crunch! Crunch!
I hit this geezer so fuckin' hard,
his legs went like a fuckin' baby giraffe.
State of that. I done me knuckles.
So hit people in the mouth,
not the back of the fuckin' head.
Just as well I did or you'd be in hospital,
you cunt.
You know what to do
if someone tries to clump you?
Kick him in the fuckin' bollocks.
Hurry up, Tom, I'm starving.
She ain't walkin' for a week.
"We'll fight them on the beaches,
we'll fight them on the..."
Right, that's it.
I'll fight every one of you
before you move on next door to us.
Come on, son!
Still he was one of
the first football thugs
Oi, three bottles of Bud, please, mate.
Bill, let's get out of here.
There's about ten Stoke fans staring at us.
- How many of 'em did you say there was?
- About ten. Please don't start, Bill.
- Right, which one of them's staring at me.
See you, you cunt. I'll cut you first.
You fuckin' mugs!
Aargh!
Hold your hand out, Raff.
- What?
- Hold your hand out.
Hold your hand out, Bill.
Do what?
Hold it out like Raff
and we'll see how old you are.
Oooh.
You trying to mug me off?
Oh, shut up.
I'm only fuckin' about an' that.
- What d'you mean, "fuckin' about"?
What d'you mean, "what"?
You know, just...
Well, don't fuckin' just.
Leave it out.
You trying to wind me up?
I'm fuckin' serious.
What I want to know is, what makes you think
you can come in here
I... I didn't mean nothing by it, Bill.
It was only a bubble, that's all.
Just a bubble?
What you talking to me
in that fuckin' muggy rhyming slang for?
I never fuckin' liked you, you little cunt.
- Leave it out, Bill.
- Leave what fuckin' out?
What, d'you wanna get
involved an' all, do you?
Don't be stupid.
I'm just saying, he's only a kid.
he's old enough to talk for himself.
I'll tell you something, Zeberfuckindee,
for mugging me off and making me look a cunt
in front of my fuckin' pals.
I...
I didn't say nothing.
Come on, outside,
you little fuckin' stumblebum.
Leave it out, eh?
Stop mutterin' and stutterin'
and fuckin' liven yourself up.
I fuckin' had you there!
Fuckin' hell, Zeb,
you should have seen your fuckin' face.
I thought you was gonna burst into tears.
What is it, four, five...
eight lagers, Donna, please, babe.
There'll be none of this in Australia.
As of next week, strictly the amber nectar.
Not to worry, William.
I think I'm more of a cocktail man anyway.
Well, I won't be sitting next to you.
Well, that was the idea.
Bill, Albert, I didn't see you there. Wanna pint?
Very funny. Very, very funny!
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, yeah.
Now a little one. Now a little one.
That's it, now let me get the door.
Let me get the door. I'll be right in there.
Comfy? Do you want any help with that?
Bit different nowadays, though, innit, eh? Gone.
It's the Pakis coming over in the '70s, see.
Taking over everything. Spoilt it.
And what you got now, eh? What you got now?
Fuckin' asylum seekers.
Bloody Tony fuckin' Blair.
He's gotta be a poof, ain't he? New Labour?
There was a time I used to be able to clear
seven and a half, eight hundred shots a week.
Not any more. Nah.
Now what you got is your fuckin' spades
up in Soho moonlighting!
Moonlighting!
Fuck's sake, that's a joke!
You need a full moon just to see 'em!
This country was built on
good people like yourselves.
Not enough of you about, that's what I say.
Here, let me give you a hand with that.
Swing your old arse round in there, look.
That's it, lovely.
And I just want to say, it's been a privilege
to drive two gentlemen like you.
And the fare's on me.
Don't be silly.
You're letting the wheelchair fool you.
No, I insist.
Don't forget, you watch
out for them darkies, eh?
What a wanker.
Let's go dancing.
Hello, Mavis, my little darling.
How are you?
I shall be sad to see you both gone, Bill.
Are you packed up yet?
Course we have. Ain't you gonna say goodbye?
Can't you do better than that.?
What are you talking about, Bill?
Don't you know?
You fucking disgusting old man!
My grandson gave me a going-away present.
A joint of his very best home-grown.
You mean drugs?
Yeah, well, you light up old, son.
I'll make do with this.
we'll be watching the sun go down
on the other side of the world.
And it won't be surrounded by tower blocks.
Miles of golden sand and bronze tits.
You packed yet?
Haven't given it a thought.
My case has been packed
and sitting inside the front door for three days.
You want to get your skates on, Farrell.
Oh, stop nagging, you old woman.
- What's that?
I'm feeling dizzy.
I tell you, I'm fuckin' mullered, me.
I am fuckin' mullered.
Look at the fuckin' boat on it.
Imagine that round your fuckin' helmet.
No, no, no, Tom. Proper fuckin' slosh pots.
Shut up, you... What's the matter with you?
All right, sweetheart? You all right, girl, yeah?
- All right?
- Do you want a drink?
A couple of little
cheeky tequilas, yeah?
- A little cheeky tequila...?
- Tequilas.
I'm gonna smash the fuckin'
granny out of that.
All the good people, right,
all the good people...
are being forced into the suburbs,
due to the influx of illegal immigrants
forcing their way into this country.
-
- Hey, mate.
Mate, will you shut your fuckin' noise?
Here you are, sloppy bollocks.
You fuckin' cunt.
Get up there, girl. Get up there.
I cannot wait to fuckin' see your fanny.
I'm gonna fuckin' ruin you...
- Let's have a butcher's here. Rod, look.
- Smash you in the...
- Look at that.
Beautiful, beautiful.
He's only fallen asleep, Tameka.
Same here, Shian. Little fuckers.
Shame. He's hung like a pike in here.
Good for you. I've got a stickleback in here.
You fuckin' little mug!
How dare you come into my fuckin' gaff,
and try and get hold of my little sister
against her will?
You're in bandit country now, boy,
no-one will even know you were fuckin' here.
There's holes dug all over South London
for people like you.
Oi, silly bollocks. What are these?
What?
- What are they?
- Flowers.
- What sort of flowers, dinlow?
- Lilies.
Then what are they doing
with the chrysanths?
All right. Sorry.
- What?
- Er... there's someone here to see you, Bill.
Who?
and wound up copping for two slosh pots
out of Chigwell.
Smashed the granny out of the pair of 'em
in the Tower Hotel till eleven, Sunday morning.
Yeah, I was back home in time for a Sunday
roast, but I was completely fuckin' anninilated.
Look, I've got to go, mate. My man's here.
Ta-da.
Good to see you, son.
- How are you? All right?
Heard you Chelsea boys had a little turnout
at Tottenham at the weekend.
You ain't wrong. Heard you Millwall boys
had a little turnout down in Pompey.
We did. We should have had a meet.
Would have been fun.
You know where to find us.
Any time you like.
Your time'll come. What have you got for me?
It's bang on. What you got round you?
Four K.
- Go on, then. I'll take the lot.
- Cash.
Hang on.
Slow down.
What? You're fuckin' joking!
All right.
I'll go straight up the hospital.
- Problem, Fred?
Someone's just done him round the canister
with a cricket bat.
You're fuckin' joking?
Is he all right?
They don't know yet.
Look, I gotta go.
- I'll keep this lot on ice for you.
- I'll call you later.
Oi! What are you fuckin' doing?
You're three hours late.
Don't start, mate. I've had a bit of ag.
What you got a sheet on for?
You don't wanna know.
You're right, I don't.
Get in and sort them dinlows out.
They're putting lilies
in with the chrysanths.
You got anything on under there?
- What do you reckon, fat boy?
- You look like a vicar, mate.
Are you fuckin' mad?
This is Prada, you cunt.
It's iron's gear.
Get your fuckin' skates on.
We gotta get there for the draw.
Horrible cunt.
What about the draw?
How are we gonna find a telly to watch it?
Oh, there'll be tellies where we're going.
Slow down, will you, Davis, eh? What's
the matter with you? Are you a fuckin' Hoover?
Let's see what's on the menu.
Oi.
Either turn that TV up, or tell that lot down there
to hold their noise down.
Calm down, Bill.
We don't want to cause a scene.
No. No, you're right.
Oi!
Oi. Will you shut up?
I'm trying to watch the fuckin' telly!
Yes! Fuckin' yes!
Eh? Can't fuckin' hear you.
Who is it, for fuck's sake?
Eh?
Yes!
- Who, who, who?
- It's fuckin' Millwall!
Aaaarghh!
Drive, mate! Fuckin' drive.
I'm being chased!
Hard to have a nice night out in London, eh?
I blame all the black s and fun pubs, myself.
Well, come on, Albert, you old bastard!
We'll miss our flight.
All right, Bill? You look pissed off.
No, I'm not fuckin' all right.
Some cunt burgled my house last night.
Hold that.
Good, this.
- What did they nick, Bill?
Even took the fuckin' kids' PlayStation
and my mobile.
- Yeah.
You know what to do?
Ring your number and see if they've still got it.
That'll freak 'em out.
Tell them you know where they live and that.
Good call, Rods.
I've got that Ride Of The Valkyries ring tone.
You know, the war cry.
That'll fuckin' freak 'em out.
Hello?
You are fuckin' dead meat.
I didn't know it was your house.
I didn't know it was your house!
Look, I've got all the gear.
I've got the PlayStation.
I'll shall fuckin' open you up!
Fuck.
Where are you from, mate?
Just around.
Are you fookin' Chelsea?
Yeah.
You flash cockney bastards.
Do you know Stanley?
Run!
Go on, run, you pair of rats.
Hey! Stop the fuckin' bus, you cunt!
Fuckin' come on!
Where the fuck are you running now?
Cunts! Fuckin' cunts!
Go on. Fuck off!
Come here.
You didn't fuckin' shine there, did you, son?
What?
I've got to go to work on him now,
stop him opening you up.
You silly bollocks.
What was all that about?
But we did 'em, didn't we, H?
Right. No thieving.
No bringing attention to yourselves.
Just keep your nuts down.
I want you to be outside and back on the road
in five minutes.
Oh, yeah, and whatever you do, no fighting.
Bit rich, coming from him, innit?
Zeb, what did Billy say to you?
He said we've got to get his gear back to him
by tomorrow.
And we've got to apologise to his wife and kids.
You've had a result there.
You're lucky. He could have battered you.
Blinding result, eh?
This complete nutter will never talk to us again,
and everyone think s we're thieving little cunts.
You  thieving little cunts.
But you know what you've got to do, don't you?
Prove yourself at Millwall.
That'll sort it out.
Yeah, do the business down there,
and you'll be an hero in his eyes.
Will you stop moaning about beer?
All you do is complain about beer.
I'll be opening bottles with my fuckin' teeth
all the way up there, Bill.
Could have done with a couple of cans.
Shouldn't have had that chicken burger.
Stone me, it's them Stoke fans that done us.
- Where?
- Over there. Look. It's them.
On the Rory, on the Rory, on the Rory.
Listen. We'll get the beers safe.
Then we'll outflank 'em, yeah?
I ain't saying a word.
What the fuck are you doing?
There's two of them Stoke fans that done us.
Drop 'em now. We'll be late for the meet.
Fuck 'em. They kicked the shit out of us.
I'll give  fuckin' "no"!
Northern cunt!
Fuckin' idiots.
Slow down, you two, for fuck's sake!
What, was you fuckin' bullied at school,
was you?
Have fun, boys.
Who are you fuckin' looking at?
Know what? I think I'll call it a night. Tom?
Yeah, let's go and have a beer.
Yeah, good idea. We'll jog on.
What about you, Tom?
All right, boys. I'll see you in a bit.
Order us some Miller.
- Light?
- Er... regular.
- No problem.
- See you later.
You all right down there, mister?
I've had the shit kicked out of me.
What about you?
Me? I'm dead.
Bill! Rod!
Help! Where are you?
Bill! Help!
Fuckin' hell.
Liven yourself up.
We're in court in half an hour.
Court? What?
Fuck... What about my dream?
What's wrong with you, Bright?
You're 40 years old,
I see children with more common sense.
Don't you dare answer me with that
insolent tongue of yours, you fat fucking slob!
Yes, sir. I'm very sorry, sir. It won't happen
again, sir. You can be sure of that.
I do hope that's the case, Mr Bright.
I'm passing this over for reports.
- Yes, sir?
If you appear before me again before that date,
How are the tulips selling?
They flew out at the market.
What's happening, Tom?
Here. I got nicked with Bright the other day,
kicking off with the OB. You'd have loved it.
Nice one, Tom. Sounds really clever.
It's not my scene any more.
Yeah, well, I'm just saying.
Well, go and say it somewhere else, and don't
come down my stall giving it the big 'un.
All right. Slow down, Ad.
Slow down?
I'll tell you about fuckin' "slow down".
What's the matter with you, clumping people?
Ain't it about time you started growing up?
You're nearly 30. You wanna get hold
of yourself. It's all a lot of bollocks, anyway.
- What?
- You're a bright kid. Work it out.
- Here you are.
- No, they're from both of us.
Tommy... think about it.
See you, Albert.
What's Harris and Bright doing there?
I could hardly stop them, Bill.
They're foolish men, Tom.
Harris think s we're connected
cos I fought in the war.
What he doesn't understand is, I fought to stop
people like him with their Fascist opinions.
Billy is a fuckin' idiot.
Are you still going to Australia?
I don't know. There's a spare ticket
going begging, if you're interested.
Your cousins would love to see you.
Do yourself a favour.
Put a bit of distance between you
and all that stuff you're mixed up in.
I'm all right, Bill.
I'm just having a laugh.
Well, just be careful.
Next time you visit the boneyard,
it could be in a box.
What are you fuckin' doing here,
you little cunt?
I've cme to pay my respects.
Well, you're not wanted.
Let's have it right. You didn't even
fuckin' know him, did you? Did you?
Well, put your soppy cap on,
then, and fuck off.
Go on, jog on.
Don't forget our appointment.
All right, boys? What's happening?
Why have you got a dartboard
drawn on your shirt, Zeb?
Well, what's it got to do with you, you mug?
All right, boys. First one to a hundred.
Aaaarghh!
Aaaarghh!
Stand up straight.
He wants to know
which one stole the PlayStation.
Me.
Good call. Crack on.
Aaaarghh!
Oi, shithead, hold your hand out.
- What, Zeb?
- I said, hold your hand out.
Just a kid, ain't you?
hold your hand out, Zeb.
Let's see how old  are.
Are you trying to fuckin' mug me off?
Bit of a coincidence, eh? Our kids play against
each other just before we meet in the Cup.
Somehow, I don't think this game's
gonna get quite as messy. Do you?
Fancy yourselves in bandit country, then?
Well, let's have it right.
If history's anything to go by,
last time we met you lot,
we ran you all over London.
You couldn't run 100 yards, mate!
- Won't fuckin' need to, either!
- Don't get lemon, Bill. It don't suit you.
Spell it, you cunt.
C-U-N-T. Cunt.
I meant "lemon", soppy bollocks.
We'll see about lemon when you're lost
in deep south, you fat fuckin' prick.
Whoa! Now we're getting personal.
Now, what's your problem?
That you have to open your kebab shop soon
or that you buy Charlie off a white man?
Well, how does it feel doing business with
a Turk, when you're supposed to be right wing?
Scooby-Do's less confused than you.
You'll be confused when I open your canister up.
You wanna wait till the game or make one now?
Don't punch above your weight,
you long streak of piss.
Well, stop punching your old woman about,
then, wanker.
What did you fuckin' say, you mug?
You fuckin' heard, you fat fuckin' Johnson cunt.
Fuckin' mug! Look at you, you cunt!
Get off me, you... Get off me, you cunt!
Fuck this. If they can't be grown up, let's go.
I'll fuckin' do you!
So... what do you do, then, Thomas?
Me?
I work long and hard.
Sounds like Rod!
Cor...
Seems nice.
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, he's a top bloke.
Bill, it's Tom. Fancy a quiet drink?
I'm bored out of my skull.
Meet me at work around seven in the morning.
Don't worry. I'll bring my tools.
- Fancy a sauna?
- Good call, Bill.
Johnson!
Johnson!
All right, Billy. What's it gonna be today?
A little lavender head massage?
No, forget that and just crack straight on
with the blow job, eh?
Stone me, she won't be working for a week.
What was that screaming about?
- What do you think?
- Good boy.
Bill, can I talk to you for a minute?
Yeah, yeah, course you can, son.
It's just er... I keep...
I dunno. I just keep... You know?
Yeah, yeah, I know.
- Really?
Fuck! Fuck it.
I thought it was just me.
No, listen.
It happens to me all the time.
No, don't worry about it. It's sweet.
Don't worry. I'm gonna sort you out.
Thank s, Bill.
You're a fuckin' good man.
Listen. Don't mention it.
- What?
Enjoy!
Wake up, sleepy.
That was my parents on the phone.
They're coming to London at the weekend
and want to take us out.
Well, as long as it ain't Saturday.
We got Millwall.
It is Saturday, Rod.
What about Sunday?
They're going to my brother's in Reading.
Don't tell me you'd rather go to football.
Well, I am male.
It's one game.
I am male.
But my parents only come round
once every few months.
Yeah, Millwall comes round
less than the eclipse, babe.
Well, don't just run out.
- I'm going to work.
There's nothing to talk about.
All right, boys?
Yeah. Sweet. Speak to you later.
Fuck off.
- Are you serving?
- Yeah, what do you need? Whites or browns?
Hit him, hit him! Hit the cunt.
Come here.
Cunt! Cunt! Cunt!
Grab the fuckin' rock.
Come on. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.
Cunt!
Come on!
- Fuckin' hell!
- Shit, that must have been Zeberdee.
Come, let's go.
You should come to Millwall at the weekend.
That'll liven you up a bit.
You all right for money, Bill?
It ain't as if I got a bird to spend it on.
Unlike Rod.
You sound over the moon about that.
Yeah, well...
Your chance'll come.
Don't you ever get the itch?
Yeah.
I can see myself on a sun lounger
in my back garden,
a couple of kids running about...
sipping my Pimm's quietly.
Kids, eh?
Yeah. Why not?
What's their names?
Dorian, after my mate.
Dorian?
Yeah, probably.
What if they're girls?
Dorian.
You're a good boy, Tom.
Keep your eye on my wallet, Bill.
I'm going to the toilet.
I tell you what, Fred.
Bollocks, does it.
I'll have Bermondsey any day.
It's full of spivs and skint hoorays round here.
I just wanna find this fuckin' Tommy Johnson
and get out of here.
Let's just cut him and fuck off back over south.
Oi, you, skint boat, come here.
- Me?
- Yes, fuckin' you. Come here.
Come on.
Ever heard of a geezer
called Tommy Johnson?
Johnson...
Johnson...
No, I've never heard of him, mate.
Yeah?
Yeah.
So, what's  name?
- What?
- I said, what's your fuckin' name?
Dorian.
Poof!
Dorian? Sounds like a fuckin' poof.
Yeah, I know.
Just a name, though, innit?
Prove it.
Prevve wmnat?
Stop fuckin' stuttering,
and fuckin' prove it.
Just show him some fuckin' brief.
Er...
I ain't got my wallet on me, mate.
Go on, then. Fuck off, you mug. Go on.
Hang on.
You've had a fuckin' touch. Little mug.
Do you reckon he's somewhere else?
We'll try the other gaff.
He's got to be here somewhere.
You'd fuckin' think so! I tell you.
The moment I seen them follow you in,
I knew you'd give them a dodgy name.
It's a little trick we picked up in the army.
I'm definitely calling my kids Dorian now.
Dorian.
- Dorian.
See you, Rodder,
I fuckin' love you sometimes. Do you know that?
You ain't too bad yourself, Johnson.
I'm well up for it now.
The omens are good. Millwall who?
Yeah.
What?
You fuckin' know.
Look, Tom, fuckin'...
Her mum and dad are coming down.
Tom, you'll need these
where you're going.
How you doing, mister?
Nah. Not good. You?
Still dead.
Sorry about that. Am I?
No, you're still alive.
- Who are you, mate?
Can't tell till I
take these bandages off.
What?
What do you mean, "what"?
What are you looking at me like that for?
You don't know?
What, Rod?
You don't remember what
you done last night?
I was fuckin' lashed, wasn't I?
Last thing I remember was being in the boozer
with you and my grandad.
Jesus, Tom...
For fuck's sake, Rod, what's so bad?
You don't remember Barbara?
Barbara who?
You tried to get off
with Billy's wife.
Fuck off.
And when she blanked you, you beat her up.
- What?
- You broke her fuckin' jaw, Tom.
I know you're winding me up, Rod.
Please tell me you're winding me up, Rod.
I ain't, mate.
Fuck off, King. I tell you what.
I'll ring Zeb. He'll fuckin' know.
All right, Zeb?
Fuckin' hell, Tom. I don't know what to say.
What am I gonna do, Rod?
You're gonna have to go round there.
What?
Just go round there and fuckin' beg.
Well, that's a good idea. I might as well
break her fuckin' nose while I'm at it.
I don't know what else to say to you, Tom.
No, you're right. I'II...
I'll fling myself on my knees
and let him kick the fuck out of me.
Hopefully,
he'll have mercy on me if I'm on the floor.
You know him better than me, mate.
That's the problem. I know what he'll do.
Johnson.
Listen, Bill, listen.
On my life, I don't remember nothing.
I was obviously smashed out of my tree.
I've woke up...
I'm none the wiser, Bill. Please, Bill.
My life.
You soppy, muggy streak of piss.
I can't fuckin' believe you fell for that!
If you'd touched my woman,
you'd already be dead!
Fuckin' arseholes.
Go on. Have a fuckin' laugh, will you?
Go on. Really fuckin'...
I really fuckin' need this at the moment,
what with my dreams,
fuckin' florists, fuckin' billboards...
Bollocks!
Cunts.
On his fuckin' knees!
Hello, Bill.
Donna, give him a pint, love.
Put 'em on the tab.
- How's your luck?
- Not bad, Billy. How are you?
I'll take some of you lot
down through South Bermondsey,
and Tommy will take the
rest from Surrey Quays.
Where's the meet?
It can't be too far away.
They'll have spotters out all over the place.
- And it's on top of the Old Bill before we start.
What about Billy?
He knows Millwall like the back of his hand.
Fuck Billy.
He don't know what he's doing any more.
Now, let's have it right.
We all know he's become a liability.
But he can't run a turnout
down in South London.
Bollocksed the day up.
His problem is,
he's taken too much of that shit up his nose.
Just forget him.
Slow down. He's one of your own.
It's like having a big kid around.
He's a fuckin' dope, mate.
He's a spent force.
What's the matter, babe?
You think I'm all right, don't you?
What?
I'm all right, aren't I?
Yeah, course you are, you silly sod.
Come here.
Eat your dinner.
Bright!
Don't fuckin' creep up
on me like that, you si!
Bill. Take it easy.
How comes you weren't down the pub
last night?
Fell asleep, didn't I?
How comes  know I weren't there?
Harris belled me and asked where you were.
Maybe he forgot, eh?
- Fuck me! What's that for?
Millwall.
Don't be stupid.
You can't take a gun down there.
- It's only a flare gun.
- What are you on about? You'll kill someone.
Fuckin' hell, Bill.
You're on the turn, ain't you?
- Ain't I?
You look as handsome
as you did on our wedding day.
You can't go to Whitehall without them, dear.
Make me the proudest woman alive.
Don't look at me.
Yeah, go on. Fuck off, you Pakis.
Fuck off!
Got the little chavvy?
Corned beefs all over the gaff.
I know, I know, I know.
Did you see the state of his boat?
Did you see it?
You don't even know you're fuckin' born!
Oh, fuck off.
Go on, fuck off, you old mug!
I know who I am now.
Show me, then.
All right, for fuck's sake.
Hurry up, lazy bollocks.
It's Millwall today.
You all right?
I'm sweet, mate. I'm fuckin' buzzing.
This is it.
What's wrong?
You look like you've seen a ghost.
Listen, Zeb. Listen, listen.
You... You'd better just...
What, Tom?
Fucking hell, Tom, what had I better do?
Just look after yourself. It might turn ugly.
Don't worry about me.
I'm gonna be a fuckin' hero.
Liven up, we've got to meet the others.
I tell you, it's a fuckin' buzz! Come on!
Here, Tom, where's Rod?
Fuck knows. You all right?
Yeah. Couldn't sleep, could I? Fuckin' buzzing.
That espresso's really kicked in.
Tell me more about the air conditioning,
Rodney. I'm fascinated.
Air conditioning?
You told me you run an
air-conditioning firm.
Well, we have a few vans out on jobs at once
most of the time.
Well, it's always busier in the summer.
Nothing like a soaring temperature
to help the work.
Anyway, most of the time I just sit
around the office, waiting for the weekend.
Don't get me wrong.
I love the money the job pays.
But my real passion lies
in kicking people's fucking heads in at football.
See, I've got to channel it somewhere,
and as you can tell by my bulging stomach,
I don't participate in too
many sporting activities.
And I don't do drugs.
Well, that's not entirely true, but not a lot.
So, I need my release, and a good fuckin' fight
seems the best way. Wouldn't you agree?
At least I wouldn't be walking around like you -
fuckin' horrible cunts with stick s up your arses,
trying to pretend
your little suburban nightmare's all right.
Mate, can we have the...
No, I'll...
Rod! I fuckin' knew you'd make it!
Wouldn't miss it for the world, mate.
There's a fuckin' shot, man.
You lot fuckin' ready for us, or what?
Well, let's see how game you really are.
So, come and find us, then, shithead.
Oh, and be careful.
Remember you're gonna be in deep south.
Away from all the crowds and the ready eye.
So, watch your fuckin' backs.
- Let's have it!
Hello, Tom.
What's happening, Joe boy?
Everything's sweet round here.
- Where's Harris?
- On his way from South Bermondsey.
Get yourself up on the bridge lively.
Later on. Bye.
- Hello, Joe, son. Where are you?
- On the bridge. It's all quiet down here.
Keep your eyes peeled.
We´ll be there soon.
- Speak to you later.
- Right. Here you are. It's sweet.
- Other end of the bridge, lively.
Sweet, Bill?
Get down here all right?
toe to toe with you.
You fuckin' mug me off like that?
Forget it.
Anyone who runs is gonna get
properly served up when we get home.
You got it?
Are you all right, son, yeah?
Yeah. Are you?
I've got to tell you now.
I've got a really bad fuckin' feeling about this.
Oi. Oi. Hold it here.
Hold it. Hold it.
Hold it.
Oi. Keep your fuckin' voices down.
Keep your fuckin' voices down.
Keep it quiet. Keep it quiet.
Fuckin' wankers!
Fuck.
Cunts!
You and your f...
Fuckin' cunt!
Get him!
Step on the cunt!
Get the cunt on the floor.
Get into him!
Johnson! Johnson!
Leave my fuckin' brother in Casualty, you cunt?
Get the fuck back!
Get out of the way!
Leave it.
You nearly wound up in
the boneyard, my son.
How come you're here?
They call it grieving.
I call it falling fuckin' over.
Rod and the others was up.
Brought you some grapes.
Was er... Zeberdee there?
Erm... young fella with black hair?
What, that little prick?
Yes, he was.
Thank fuck for that.
What about Australia, Bill?
I'll fly next Tuesday.
What about you?
What about me?
Huh!
Was it worth it?
Yeah, just get a pint over here.
They reckon, as soon as he got sentenced,
he started crying his eyes out.
I'll do it standing on my head, you mug.
Fuck off.
You corrupt cunt. It's people like you
that are ruining this fuckin' country, you nonce.
-
-
Here you are.
- Where are you going, you slippery cunt?
- Khazi. He gave me a livener.
Zeb, leave me some,
or you're fuckin' dead.
What's happenin', Zeberfuckindee?
