someone comes home unexpectedly.

Even with the banal simple forgeries
it takes weeks before it is discovered.
have to happen.
For a work of art so valuable
that you do not have to worry about anything.
Or you get caught.
My name is Roger Brown.
I is 1.68.
You do not need a psychologist to understand
that it must be compensated.
My house, for example.
Tariff: 30 million.
I do not like it, and has not
afford it. But she loved it.
How often do you have a girlfriend
which opens the gallery?
I said it was an inheritance. Something I had to say.
But I have just inherited bad genes.
There has been a laborious process
to find the truth.
If someone like me get what he wants,
only one thing:
Money.
A lot of money.
But there is one thing
Diana wants more than anything else.
And that's just the thing
I do not want to give her.
- Is not she cute?
- Cute.
Diana Power Eliassen is
one of the beautiful, tall, smart.
Those who are used to make love.
Those who take it for granted.
The NOK of men would give her that.
Men who are higher than 1.68.
But soon it's my turn.
My opportunity. I can feel it.
In the meantime, I play loud. For the
he who does not play, do not win.
- What are you going tomorrow?
- Why?
We are invited to dinner.
- We are invited to dinner?
- Yes.
- Are you talking about with others?
- There is one I want you to meet.
This ends now.
I am sincerely sorry.
- Let now be...
- No. Lotte...
- The two of us are not.
- Can you keep up?
- An impressive resume, Lander.
- Thank you.
Yes, I think I am
the right man for the Pathfinder.
- What about your life outside of work?
- Is it?
You should then here in Oslo. On Sk√∏yen.
And is married to...?
Camilla. Been married for nine years.
Two children. They go to school.
Jobs-she?
- Yes. In a law office downtown.
- Who is the home of a child is sick?
- She.
- No maid?
- No.
- Dog?
- No.
- Allergic?
- No.
How much is your reputation
head worth?
My reputation?
What do you mean?
The plant is designed by Julian Opie.
Worth a quarter of a million.
- Do you art in the price range?
- Yes, actually.
A lithograph by Munch.
Brooch.
Can you say what it is worth
just by looking at it?
This consists of circles and lines.
Monotone coloring, without texture.
Anything that makes it worth the quarter
million, is the artist's reputation.
- And the same applies to managers?
- Quite right.
And that is why
you are not going to get this job.
- What?
- Oh my God, you searched for it myself.
- What else could I do?
- Won someone to tell us about you.
Left as if you did not know about it
when we contacted you.
Everything is a game, Lander.
Listen now...
Pathfinders Chairman
and controller come in the morning.
I want you to meet them.
Listen politely.
So you explain why
you are no longer interested.
- They will perceive me as junk.
- No. As ambitious.
As someone who knows his own value.
- Lander, this is your opportunity.
- Ability?
Let me build your reputation.
I will promise you a job
as fivefold salary within two years.
How can you promise that?
Because I have never given a customer
a recommendation he has not followed.
- But how?
- The answer begins with "r".
- Renomm√©...
- My whole career is built on it.
Hello.
You have an interview with Jeremiah
Lander and Pathfinder in the morning at. 12.
- The information is on file.
- Yes. Great.
Your wife's supposed to open gallery
Now this weekend, and I was wondering...
- Is it possible to get there?
- Are you invited?
- Yes, I'm there?
- Are you?
I have received an invoice for 357000
for renovation of Kasper Hansen Street.
Votes. I have helped Diana with
expenses. She opened the gallery on Friday.
You have to cut consumption.
You can go bankrupt at any time.
I'm working on it.
I must tell you
how serious the situation is.
You have overdrawn card
with several hundred thousand...
I have another phone here.
I'll call later.
You have a candidate.
Jeremiah Lander, lives in Sk√∏yen.
- Yes. We got him. When?
- A meeting of the Alfa in the morning at. 12.
- No one home?
- No. His wife works in the city.
We meet about twenty.
Receiver in Gothenburg
was to have fifty percent.
Ove Kjikerud would be 20% for
to disconnect the alarm, get the art -
And run to Sweden with it.
To hire him in Tripolis was something
of the smartest thing I had done.
Although I was left with 80000
It was not until the next
quarterly installments on the house.
Something had to happen.
Hello.
Thank you for coming.
- It looks very good.
- Not half has come yet.
- But I'll not have to meet...
- Hey, it's very nice.
- Congratulations. Fantastic show.
- Thank you.
There has been something wild today.
I can not tell it now.
- But I want you to meet him.
- Hitting who?
- This is my husband. Roger Brown.
- Clas Greve.
Clas has just moved here.
From the Netherlands.
Hello, are you going?
No, the kids just brighten up.
- What brings you to Norway? Work?
- I inherited my grandmother's apartment.
- She was Norwegian?
- Yes.
I have retired me early.
I'll put the apartment in order.
Retired?
From what?
I was a director of a uniform
technology business.
We work primarily with GPS.
Shall we...?
- Hollandsk? Not HOTE, right?
- Yes, exactly.
Did not they just acquired by
a large American company? Amtech?
- You work yourself in the industry?
- No.
- Why did you leave?
- Let me not bore you with the job talk.
I work in the recruitment industry.
You bored me with a job talk.
- Do you know the Pathfinder?
- Of course. Our competitors.
Small.
Skilled.
I have to go.
Have a good evening.
Clas...
Pathfinder seeks new boss.
One that can withstand
takeover attempts by foreign countries.
- Shall we take a meeting?
- Sorry.
A lunch. Monday at. 12.
We can talk about something else.
Arts, renovation,
Polish workers...
I write down
the name of a good restaurant.
You do not take no for an answer?
A parting gift
for long and faithful service?
No, I stole it.
When we meet.
Say hello to your charming wife.
- This is my husband.
- Roger Brown.
Broad-lock, NCIS.
- You have seen on TV.
- He investigates art thefts.
- Do not murder?
We insert all resources
on this. We must stop it.
- Are you in the art industry?
- No. I work as a headhunter.
- In the recruitment industry. Alfa.
- One of the partners, that is.
I gave your wife a compliment
for the exclusive earrings.
- She said they were a gift from you.
- Yes.
Yes, the best of us
good bonus schemes.
I wish
that we had it in my industry as well.
Barring? From VG.
Could we have a picture?
Sure.
Roger?
Will you?
See here. The search for
the kalydonske boar, by Rubens.
Stolen by Germans
in Antwerp in 1941.
Since it has been missed.
Do you know how it all fits now?
- No.
- Clas Greve apartment in Oscars gate.
The grandmother had a secret relationship
to a German officer during the war.
Then he was arrested,
and shot a few days.
- She panicked to be discovered.
- And then she hid the painting?
- But it is not true.
- Overall, the Germans on the reproductions?
- Why did he tell you?
- He would have an independent valuation.
Asked if I knew someone
who could do it.
Clas Greve has a genuine Rubens painting
in his apartment?
- Here in Oslo?
- Yes.
I offered to contact
an art museum, to be moved there.
Next week. Such a picture stack the
not only in a safety deposit box.
- How much do you think it is worth?
- Tens of millions. Maybe 100
Do you know what I think?
I think that we two should celebrate.
- Celebrate what?
- That you have started your own gallery.
- And us.
- Thank you for supporting me, Roger.
- Everything will be fine.
- What do you mean?
The fact that we have two
should start thinking about the future.
- Yes, it's Ove.
- We have a candidate.
- Do you know what time it is?
- Clas Greve, Oscars gate 25
- Is there a count?
- His name is Count.
Ove?
- Ove? What happens?
- Sorry. Natasha is here.
- What did you say?
- Meet me at the house tomorrow.
No, not tomorrow! It's Saturday.
I have her all weekend.
This is great, Ove.
We only have a couple of days on us.
The time-a!
- Okay, okay.
- So nice you are.
- Good morning.
- You...?
- Yes?
What you said yesterday
to think ahead...
Includes the sound of
small shuffling feet in the hallways here?
- Maybe so.
- Do not say maybe, Roger.
I said yesterday
that everything would work out.
- I will have that conversation now.
- Agree, but I will in an important meeting.
Do you think I'm stupid?
You should be in an important meeting?
Come in a position tonight?
I must go.
We called later.
- What are you so afraid?
- Nothing.
Dogs.
And you, when you are like now.
If we are to be childless
the rest of my life, I know.
Yes, but now I
in an important meeting.
- Have tried to talk about it for 7 years.
- And it will take 7 years.
If you continue
to push on the way!
It did not.
You are never going to give me a child.
How many million are we talking about?
- Perhaps up to a hundred.
- A hundred?!
It's every time, Ove. I have said
I do not want stuff like that here.
You know I always have weapons.
At home I have weapons everywhere.
Can now a Green in every room.
You should also get one.
Sooner or later they come.
Ok. You go to Gothenburg
and obtain a reproduction.
We must have a well. I have lunch
with Clas Greve on Monday...
Ove?
- I told you to get in the car!
- But I have no fire!
Out!
We have a meeting here!
Women...
As I would say before I was interrupted
of a Russian prostitute...
At lunch Monday I will find out
when the apartment is empty.
- You go to Sweden immediately. Now.
- Okay.
- No, fuck. I'm busy.
- Busy?
Natasha is here.
I'll make a new movie with her.
I have arranged everything
with the guys at work.
- You movies her?
- I must have something to watch.
I just turn on the alarm,
then roll the cameras.
- So she does not know that you are filming?
- No.
And the guards are sitting
and watching the two of you...?
I have no camera
directed against the bed!
They will see that she is undressing,
and some fingering. That's it.
She has cut itself.
Nice.
The rest is for the parlor.
Fat, or?
There are only a few days
the image moves.
- Do you understand how big this is?
- She is here twice a season.
You will
to be left with millions.
For that much money you can buy her.
For the rest of your life.
I take it without crayfish jelly,
and dressing on the side.
Are you in Oslo now, or
it will be much oscillation in the future?
Three and a half million,
plus stock options.
You take things a bit for granted.
Remember that you are a foreigner.
Norwegian companies want...
Your method works for sure
at most.
But we have been
in this situation before.
- You literally savlet...
- Savlet?
You dribbled when we met at the gallery.
It made you right in.
The problem was only
I was not interested in the job.
But I found that renovation
the apartment is not as exciting.
So if it's ok for you...
Let's just drop the play.
Ok.
I give myself.
- But I need more information.
- Do you play squash?
- Married?
- Signs.
- Children?
- Unfortunately.
- Dog?
- Yes. I have.
- In Amsterdam.
- Quarantine?
I will fly down and get it tomorrow.
It's hard in the GPS industry?
- Your back.
- Now... It is from the military.
I joined as a 18-year-old.
After a few years
I ended in a special unit...
- Specialized in what?
- Tracking.
- Tracking...?
- People.
Missing.
Wanted.
- And the technology was provided by HOTE?
- Exactly.
They made microscopic transmitters.
I had suggestions for improvements.
So they recruited me.
- Where are the scars from?
- Bolivia.
- Were you tortured?
- No, I dropped off on time.
- Sounds like something from a movie.
- No, you have not seen the movie.
- When can we meet with Pathfinder?
- Anytime.
- When are you back?
- The day after tomorrow.
So we take it then.
Diana?
Hey, it's Diana. I can not
answer the phone now. Have a nice day.
- Hey.
- As of late you are.
- I tried to call you on your mobile.
- I must have missed it in the gallery.
- Was it something important?
- No.
I just wanted to hear your voice.
You are cute. Come and sit down,
it has just started a film.
No.
I...
I'm completely finished.
I go to bed.
Ok.
We developed a gel that contains
hundreds of transmitters per ml.
It sticks to everything,
and are impossible to remove.
You mean Trace.
The weakness is that Trace is
sensitive to such. mud.
This I know
of experience as a soldier.
When you are in, excuse me,
the world's butt hole...
When you are dependent on
that the equipment works.
That you come by Brown,
is clearly of great importance.
Ultimately, it is he
which must make its recommendation.
A moment only.
- Very good.
- Thank you. Well home.
When writing your recommendation?
- We must make a decision first.
- What do you say?
There are several candidates. We must
assess the overall picture. You will be notified.
Have we been at the same meeting?
It could not have gone better.
- They were ready to write the contract.
- When you're in the good way.
Hello.
You travel to Gothenburg tonight, Ove.
The image is sold
as quickly as possible.
Hello.
I have to talk to you.
- Don't see me like this.
- Can you give me two seconds?
I apologize if it's my fault
that you have it so, but we have...
It's really not
something more to talk about.
- Do you need money?
- I miss you so much.
Lotte...
Lotte...
Do not contact me again.
- You look tired.
- Thank you.
- Is there anything?
- No.
- Is there a lot at work?
- Yes, a little.
I had a meeting with Pathfinder
in the day. And Clas Greve.
- Okay?
- No.
- He does not get the job?
- Absolutely not.
Tomorrow I'll call the other agencies.
I will ensure
that he did not get a job in Norway.
Why?
Did you find your mobile, by the way?
- You had lost your mobile.
- Yes.
- In Gallery?
- Yes.
- So good. More wine?
- Yes, thank you.
Ove?
Ove...
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?
You came down here and did not come out.
- I was worried.
- For what?
Nothing.
- You Roger...
- Yes?
Have a nice day at work, then.
I love you.
Ove!
- Ove, where do you live?
- Natasha...
Ove...
Ove!
Where are...?
Ove, what happened in the garage?
Did you see anyone?
Answer me now.
So what happened?
Was there anyone there?
- Natasha...
- What?
What the hell is going on here?
Ove, what is the password?
- The password for the alarm.
- Natasha...
We need to disable the alarm.
What is the password?
- What is my password!
- That is what I say! Natasha!
Sj or ch?
Ove...
Ove, how's it going?
- What happened?
- You put yourself in a syringe in the car.
A syringe?
- You have been lucky.
- Lucky?!
You got the needle in the knee.
The toxin did not properly inserted.
- Do you fuck up?
- This is about something else!
Diana has a relationship with Clas Greve.
He kills you not
because if he fucks your wife!
Call 1-13, then!
- We shall have no police up here!
Please, Roger.
I've got to the hospital.
- Or so I dauer.
- I collect milk.
Milk neutralizes poison. They had
done nothing else in the hospital.
- Call.
- Do not do anything stupid.
When I do it myself.
Now we take it very quiet...
Roger.
I must speak with you.
I have spent most of my
adult life to track down people.
Microscopic transmitters.
Good day.
Have imagined a short trip to the cabin.
- I thought it was Kjikerud.
- No.
- It is his car.
- Yes.
- If you do not like that business man?
- I got fired.
- Can I put the car in the barn?
-500 A day.
You can get free
down the road, you know.
If you touch the tractor,
I have a compensation!
- Makan to the race that is here today!
- I will only visit the Roger Brown.
- Is he the business man?
- Yes.
- What are you doing with him?
- We have a deal.
I have nothing to do with
what you are doing, but...
He has not invited you
for coffee and cakes at the cabin.
In the cabin?
Since it is my site, is perhaps
some compensation just and reasonable.
Search!
Hello?
Who are you?
Oh, oh hell...
You will not be up, you!
- Has anyone asked for me?
- No. Come and lie down.
Apart from the police.
They sit and wait for you at a time.
I said you should
eat breakfast first.
Because if you manage to turn into
larynx, are you good at fighting.
Ever heard of co-daw-ying?
Not so strange. Do you know how many
martial arts that exist? 3000.
Egyptian shuffle game...
Stand still!
Sunded, I got him!
Olav Sunded from NCIS.
You are suspected of
killing of farmer Sindre Aa.
Join us Kjikerud,
we will rest inside.
You erOve Kjikerud?
Yes.
- Where are we?
- Elverum police for questioning.
Hope you work,
so I can go to Oslo tomorrow.
- Message to all patrol cars.
- Both, in other words.
Bravo 3-0 match.
Egmon Karlsen
reviewed the trailer stolen.
- Sounded Karlsen sober look like?
- Not entirely, no.
Call Bear pub.
It is probably parked there.
- Why did you kill the farmer, then?
- I have no idea what you're talking about.
Mercedes was your
the barn to Sindre Aa.
- You drove his tractor into the ditch.
- I have never heard the name.
- No trailer outside the Bear pub.
- I have more important things to do now.
Check behind the Kiwi.
Sorry.
- We have several witnesses...
- Where is the course, fuck me!
Call Egmon. I see the trailer.
Surely the son who has stolen borrowed it.
What do you do now, Basking shark?
As I said.
We have many proofs.
And the stubborn refusal.
Then you tell me details,
for I fall right out here.
Neighbors to find you in the ditch
next to the tractor.
We developed a gel that contained
hundreds of transmitters per ml.
It sticks to everything,
and are impossible to remove.
I love you.
- We have to leave.
- No.
He's going to kill us.
He has smeared transmitters in my hair!
- Calm down!
- He has smeared transmitters in my hair!
- He will kill me!
- Calm down!
We must get out!
Hey, it's Diana.
Hello?
Hello?
Roger, is that you?
After this
we go to Forensic.
Then we take a look
the house of Kjikerud.
"I am a single girl in Gjovik.
You are the most sexy cop. "
"And the smartest. Will you meet me?
I'm with at the most. "
What the hell happened here?
Lotte, wait.
- What are you doing here? What has happened?
I need help. Please.
- Do not poke yourself in this.
- Into what?
When they ask, do not lie.
Just say that I was here.
Just say that I forced myself into.
What has happened?
Wait here.
I'll get something to clean it with.
Do you have a case?
Lotte, who do you contact?
- Get the phone!
- Stop.
- "Roger lives. He is in the apartment".
It's not who you think...
- What is going on?
- I do not know!
It's not my fault!
- What is going on?
- Please...
- What is it Greve want with me?
- He will have a job in the Pathfinder.
- Man does not kill for a job!
It's about billion.
They have worked with it since they found
that Pathfinder searched president.
- Who are 'they'?!
- Clas.
- He still works for HOTE.
- What?
- What?!
- They have huge financial problems.
Amtech requires HOTE provide them
Pathfinder technology.
- It was Clas' task.
- Are you insane?
I should learn to recognize,
and then introduce you to him.
He had to add a new plan,
since you would not see me more.
He had to find
a way to meet you.
His grandmother had an old copy
of a Rubens painting.
He made a wild story about
she got it from a German officer.
He told Diana story
and she believed him.
Then he met you.
The only thing I did was
to lubricate the transmitters in your hair for you.
Did you know?
Is it you who have smeared
the crap in my hair?!
- Is Diana with it?
- I do not know. I think so.
- You think so?!
It's not that I want this!
I just want away from him.
Can not you help me?
Can I get a glass of water?
Lotte!
The suspect died in the accident along
with three of the four police officers.
The last police officer
is still missing.
Divers from the Army is now seeking to
and along the river. So, to Middle East...
Diana.
Roger?
What has happened?
Do not look at me like that.
I know why you left.
There is no more between the Classroom and me.
I tried to put it in the garage,
but could not.
- But what do you know...?
- No, I have to say this now.
It was not meant
that it would happen. But you hurt me.
He was so easy to talk to,
and I just...
Did not want no more.
It was wrong.
And I am ashamed of myself that way.
For it is you I want.
If you really believe that we do not
to have children, we do not need it.
I am willing to
to do anything.
You love me, you...
Never stop believing in it.
Promise me that.
- And you did nothing.
- About what?
You knew nothing.
Oh, my God.
What has happened?
Come.
Dog bites are dangerous.
You must get a doctor to look at it.
It fits a little bad right now.
Hold this.
- What are you going to do now?
- I do not know.
They will soon find out
who died in the accident.
I have to remove the evidence.
And then?
I must get away from here.
Restart.
Maybe the two of us could...
I can wait
by saying that it is stolen.
I have to clean them too.
Do you love her?
No.
How could you be so fucking stupid?
Rane art?
And buy things I need?
Who do you think I am?
You have asked me
what I fear.
And I have been afraid
since the first time I met you.
I have been afraid
that you would leave me.
Afraid that we would have a child that
you would have loved more than me.
And I have been afraid that you
to see who I really was.
And hate it.
- Sorry this Greve.
- It's all right.
Roger Brown is
on an unexpected trip abroad.
- It sounds interesting.
- He had to rescue an important contract.
But you are in safe hands now. The
only formalities remain.
So it will be NOK go quickly.
Hello.
We should replace a fan of B4.
We have gone back and forth across the
day. But this card works not.
Thank you.
Hello, boys. Sorry,
but we are a little behind here.
Got just a woman who has
lying dead on the floor heating for 14 days.
- What do you think about this, then?
- Typical car accident damage to both.
- Internal bleeding is the cause of death.
- Where are the peanuts?
It's about a bag of peanuts.
Where is it?
I have not eaten them.
- Has it been compromised here?
- To steal a bag of peanuts?
Who is it?
What the hell is going on here, Roger?
Removes the track? Do you think
you get away with this?
What the heck?
So you did it with the hair?
That's where the transmitters set.
That it was Lotte, who...
- That's why you killed her?
- Does it feel like a loss?
I give you a choice.
Tells you what is going on,
you get a shot in the head.
- Otherwise, you get a bullet in the stomach.
- Have you no feelings about it?
I want to know
about people like you really are.
Such as me?
People who can not love.
Which is without empathy.
- Empathy?
- Yes.
If you want an answer to it,
so look yourself in the mirror.
- I'm not like you.
- Are you not?
No.
- I have loved someone.
- You have loved someone? Diana?
Her you loved?
I'm afraid
that I have sad news.
She says she longs for me.
She wants me.
And I'm only human.
Have you loved someone?
Someone other than the dead dog?
I do not have time for this.
I have an appointment with Diana in the evening.
You pick the hair. You know
I will come after you. Why?
It takes a long time to die of stomach shots.
You will beg me to kill you.
So I ask you one final time:
Why am I here?
Why are you smiling?
Why am I here?
Stop that!
Do you know why I smiled, Clas?
Because you just proved
that Diana loves me.
She did not come to you
because she wanted you.
She came because she was
replacement cartridges in your gun.
She has replaced bullets in your gun.
To I√, sskudd.
Or what do you call it in Denmark?
Blanks?
- What the hell are you talking about?
- She hates you.
She wants you to die.
But I'll give you one chance.
I have no idea how many balls
Diana managed to change.
It is not like you, Clas...
Is it over?
Yes.
I might not myself,
but others. The gamble I.
Welcome to this press conference
under the auspices of the Oslo police and NCIS.
I had prepared myself well.
Service pistol from the crash would
Police find the Kjikeruds bedside.
The same gun killed Lotte Madsen,
as the press called Greves mistress.
How "art thieves" Ove Kjikerud and
Clas Greve had killed each other...
Had a whole world
been joined on the internet.
They also wanted to find out
that the gun fired Greve, -
- Consistent with the ball
as perforated trained head.
He should never have taken the gun.
We can present
a breakthrough in the case.
I had done everything right.
But one thing I could not change.
Ove was already dead
when I shot Greve.
But Broad lock is
Norway's most famous detective.
Unresolved issues are not his style.
Especially not after VG called him:
"The man who gets to Norway
to sleep well at night. "
Because he's accomplished?
Absolutely.
But mostly because he has understood what
