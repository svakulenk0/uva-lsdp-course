Alright.
But you take care of it.
Hello
I'm Lieutenant McDonagh.
New Orleans homicide.
What can I do for you?
A friend of mine's daughter got a ticket
for speeding.
She was doing 75 on the way to the
hospital to visit her grandmother.
Has a couple of minor, minor moving
violation in the past. She's in danger
of losing her license.
- What do you want me to do?
- I'd like you to take care of it for me.
You come out to the scene of an accident
just to ask me that?
We got both parts to submit.
It shouldn't be a problem.
Are you asking me to break the law?
Is that what you're doing here?
Are you asking me to break the law?
I'm asking you one cop to another
to do me a favor.
- The answer is no.
- Just like that?
Just like that.
Isn't this the same police department
my father was in?
Will you excuse me.
Right. Guardian of the flame, right?
Fucking ass.
Get back in your car, Lieutenant.
Or else what?
Hey there.
Hey, what are you doing here?
- You know, the lieutenant, officer?
- Yes, we used to work together.
Why don't you walk him back to his car.
I could've told not to bother with that
asshole.
If you need a ticket fixed, why didn't
you come to me?
I didn't know you work here
They only let me out on patrol when
they're shorthanded. Or else they got
me in the property room.
Property room? What are you doing tonight?
- You're asking me out?
- Yes, I am.
Hey.
You like this boots, don't you?
Who cares who bought it on you, you
know that.
- You horny?
- Oh yeah.
No, you're not.
Yeah true.
Whenever I take prescription except for
the heroin.
Hey! Wake up McDonagh.
You know there's times I can't get what
I need with the prescription.
- Really?
- Yeah.
My back hurts sometimes
Maybe there's something I can do to make
that pain go away.
You definitely can.
What's that, baby? What do you want me
to do for you.
Check out your property room.
See if there's any Oxycotin or morphine
that you can sneak out of there.
Just make sure you get rid off the
voucher copy.
You're nuts.
It's gonna be more complicated than I
thought.
You're kidding me.
The best thing to do is now have a plead
not guilty. By the time a court date
comes around, I'll talk to cover up.
I thought that's what you're gonna do.
I went straight to the lieutenant.
It'll work out. It's just gonna take a
little longer.
Kinda calls in the question 'half a
point for nothing' concept don't you
think?
- You're some cheap freak, you know that?
- You say you gonna do something, you dont do it.
Good. Charge me for that point.
And, after last weekend, you're down $
You might I mean might have thought to
bring me little something?
Okay. You got it.
- How long has he been in there?
- About 20 minutes.
- Who else?
- His girlfriend at least one.
That's as far as we know.
What are these fucking Iguanas doing on
my coffee table?
- They ain't no Iguana.
- Yeah, they are.
It ain't no iguana.
What the fuck is that?
Fucking iguana.
Are we set up?
- SWAT is around the corner.
- No.
No. No SWAT. Let them stay there.
Well the Duty Captain said he want to
coordinate with us when we...
Is that right, Stevie? Is that what
you're fucking doing now? Reporting back
to the fucking Duty...
I'm telling you what he said.
We need SWAT, we'll call 'em.
Let's go.
- Who else is in here?
- Nobody.
We don't come back everyday, you
understand?
One times we come back, you want
chances that child getting shot.
Ain't nobody here.
He's hiding back there in the armoire.
You all stay with her. Armand.
Get out. I said get out.
Damn, man
You know, it's always nice to see
intact family.
Father want as his obligations, as far
as the children are concern.
Less the important thing. You maybe
hiding in an armoire. But your child
knows you're here.
- Are you trippin' man?
- Armand give us some air, would you?
And shut the door.
Shut up.
Shut the door.
Sit down.
Relax, take a sit.
Now we can talk.
- You dont mind if I light one up, do you?
- Fuck, man.
I find it relaxes me.
What the fuck, man.
You know we got your boy. "G" right?
Man, I don't know no "G".
He knows you.
It's amazing how much you can get done
when you got a simple purpose guiding
you through life.
My purpose is to find out who shot up
this apartment, on Josephine.
I know the guy is from Senegal,
I know he was selling heroin,
I know whose territory he was stepping on.
I know who went over to the apartment to
straight him out.
I found out all that in the past few days.
Where's Big Fate, Son?
I don't know no Big Fate.
You see, I know that's not true.
Because everybody who comes from where
you come from does know who Big Fate is.
The fact that you're lying to me about
it, tells me you're hiding something.
Since you know my only reason for being
here is to find out who shot up the
apartment I know that's what you're
See, it all...
It all comes back to that same simple
purpose.
Man,
I ain't telling you shit.
Hey, what's wrong?
Your father was mad at me because I
can't take care of his fucking dog
Why he had you to take care of it?
Because he's going back into A. A.
He says he can't deal with anymore
responsibility.
Besides, he's gotta stop drinking.
I mean gotta take care of it, but I leave
at 7 o'clock in the morning to go to work.
Let me talk to him.
I tried to be good wife to him,
Terrence. I do.
But you know I got a limit too.
He says he got a drinking problem
He wants to do something about it,
that's good.
He's been down that road before, It
didn't take, he wants to try it again.
Good.
I said why don't just take beer the way
I do. He says he can't do that.
- Hey, Pop.
- How are you doing?
- You said the meeting is at 7.
- I'd like to get there early. Set up the chairs.
I'll take it.
She can do it.
I came over to see you let me take you
for a ride at least.
You feed the dog?
You feed the dog?
I can take care of it.
What are you talking about?
Genevieve told me a little about what's
going on and I'll take the dog off your
hands for a while.
And how you're gonna take care of a dog?
I got a friend. She just loves animal.
All of them. Dogs too.
Let's go
Have a good time
No, no
Fuck you.
Fuck you.
Can we not discuss this on the phone?
How come you only come when you need
something?
You're fucked up, aren't you?
What? Yeah... yeah...
I'm fucked up.
What are you doing?
I'm going to work.
I've to go to "Bloxxy" tonight. Going
to the hotel casino.
Well how are you gonna take care of the dog if
you're fucked up, and you're going to "Bloxxy"?
The doorman is gonna walk him in the
morning and get back in the afternoon?
- What's his name?
- I don't know.
You don't know his name?
That's my father's
You are unbelievable.
I gotta get going.
Unbelievable.
Baby, nice to me.
He smells.
He needs a bath.
Did you try to understand something. It doesn't
matter that you're just along for the ride.
It doesn't matter that you didn't
actually shoot anybody.
You're playing "The Price is Right" now.
The price is Big Fate gain off lights gonna help
D.A. convict you and your boy "G".
I guarantee you that's just the way he's gonna do.
- The piss smoke at, man.
- What are you talking about.
Might as well get fucked up I gotta
listen to all this bullshit.
- So break out the smoke, man.
- You flippin' out on us, Midget?
Nah, man. Your partner lid up a motherfucking
blunt before you put the cuffs on.
I love this guy.
What did you say? You saying I smoke
Marijuana in your presence.
Cannabis? Is that what you're saying?
Yeah, right.
Your word against mine, so the fucker
won't believe me, right?
Lieutenant, can you step out for a
moment?
My name is Eugene Gratz, Lieutenant.
I'm an attorney.
This is my client, Donald Godsha.
I understand you've been looking for him.
How can I help you?
I just wanna talk to these guys for a
second. Why don't you wait in there?
Gentlemen.
- Can I get you a glass of water?
- No, thanks.
I got to turn over the names of my
witnesses to my lawyer
Once I do that,
Godshaw look to scare the kid
He can't scare him, he kill him.
I'll never get to him.
Since Godshaw turn himself in, I've
authorized 24 hour to start immediately.
Just remember, we have no fingerprints,
no DNA, no weapon.
We lost the kid, we lose the case
Understood?
He's a nice dog, but I just can't keep him.
She said she'd be back at one o'clock
this afternoon. I'm off at 4, and I
have anotherjob I gotta be at.
- She didn't call?
- No.
And I ain't gonna walk him. And I just
can't leave the animal on her apartment,
It might do damage.
- How do you get my number?
- Ms. Frankie gave it to me. In case of emergencies.
Emergencies.
This is what I'm talking about.
Doesn't pick up the phone.
Isn't where she's supposed to be.
Not showing up.
Terence, did you think you can put me
on the witness stand by May 15th.
I don't know. Why?
My mom goes for the parole board.
I'm sure we can get people to put in a
good word for her.
Hello
Where are you?
Okay, I'm about an hour from there.
I'm on my way.
Frankie, I'm on my way.
You ever been to "Bloxxy"?
Okay, You stand there. Don't move.
I'll be back in five minutes
- Baby.
- Hi, Baby...
What are you doing?
You alright?
You okay?
Who did it?
- Do you have anything for me?
- Some coke.
- That's it?
- And Vicodin.
I'll take both.
What the fuck is going on in here?
Who is this?
Get easy.
Just get my money. He never paid.
- What are you, jealous boyfriend?
- Shut the fuck up.
Just get me my money.
I used to pay when I'm done.
Done smacking her around?
It was out of chip, man.
I didn't hurt her.
Terence, let's just go.
We don't hit woman down south.
You just made a big mistake there.
My father is Andy.
You wanna get rid of him?
Who?
- One of the biggest developers in the Gulf Coast.
- Congratulations.
Tommy Leonardi is one of his best friends.
Hey listen to me, scumbag!
Don't try to impress me with your father
knows some guinea hood.
What you gotta take away from this experience.
Is if you ever see that girl again? You
turn around and you walk in opposite
direction. You got that?
I had you just looking at that girl,
you gonna wish you were born without a dick.
Big mistake.
Big mistake
Daryl, this is Frankie, Frankie, this is Daryl.
- Hi Daryl.
- Hi.
I gotta go talk to someone.
You go and take Frankie to the coffee
shop, and you stay with her.
- You can do that, right?
- Yeah.
- Do you have to do that now?
- I'll be with you in a minute.
Let's go. Take care of me.
- What Louisiana go off at?
- 3 points underdogs.
- What are they losing by?
- 8.
- How the fuck is that?
- There's still 2 minutes to play.
Louisiana ain't got his passing game, friend.
Good point.
You want my pick for the "Pac-10"?
Do I look like I wanna hear em?
Where is the boy?
He went to the bathroom
- Are there any bath beside that one?
- Yeah, on the other side.
What's going on?
What he said when he left?
He asked me if I'd be okay waiting here
by myself. I said yeah, he said he
gotta go to the bathroom.
- He is a witness to a homicide.
- What?
To 5 homicides. Let's go.
- Where are we going?
- To find him.
Where is he?
Binnie, call security.
There isn't gonna be anybody.
Where's your grandson, Binnie?
I don't have to tell you anything.
Yeah, you do.
I haven't done anything. My grandson
haven't done anything.
If he don't want to be witness, he
doesn't have to be a witness.
This is bigger than you want to.
It was a massacre.
Children were executed.
Well maybe you should've thought of that before.
I need to know where he is.
Young man, I would like to know the
name of your superior.
Right now, I walk on about an hour and
half of sleep over the past 3 days.
And I'm still trying to remain calm.
I'm beginning to think that that's
getting in the way of being effective.
What are you doing?
I want to know where Daryl is.
My God.
Nobody saw me coming.
Nobody knows I'm here.
This old woman gonna run out of air.
And you're gonna have a tough time convincing
people that It wasnt you who did it to her.
And even if. Even if you convinced them
that you didn't kill her on purpose.
You're still gonna have a tough time
selling them that you took care of her
with a fuck.
Now, listen to me.
Where the fuck is he?
I said where the fuck is he?
He's on an aeroplane.
Ms. Edwin had bought him a ticket.
She sent them to live with her family in
England.
It's okay.
There we go, that's it.
That's a good girl.
Let's breathe.
You drop dead you selfish cunt.
You ever think about your kids?
Your grandkids?
Suck it up their inheritance through
that oxygen tube?
And Binnie's fucking intensive care.
I hate you, I hate you both
Right now, I should've fucking kill you.
You're the fucking reason this country
going down to drain.
Watch out, he is not in a good mood.
Come in.
Have a sit.
Scotland Yard called.
The kid's in England.
Make him a material witness.
Maybe Scotland Yard will hold him.
Can't do that.
He had no involvment with the crime.
He don't want to testify.
We can't compel it.
Well we can still try flipping one of
the three.
Yeah you can try all you want.
Nobody flippin' on Godshaw. They're
scared to death.
As of now, all they all are person of
interest.
You gotta let them go.
Come on.
You weren't supposed to let the kid out
of your sight, Lieutenant. Now you
just be glad that he dont turn out dead.
- This is bullshit.
- Get the hell out of here.
Hey lawyer, you're not the one...
Get out of my office!
- We're risking our lives on the street.
- Easy... easy...
You know what's involved, right?
- Take it easy.
- Maybe if we have a prosecutor...
- What happened when you went to see his grandmother.
- I told you.
She said that the woman she takes care
are buying a plane ticket and he was on
his way to England, to stay with

- What kind of incident?
Any kind.
No.
Whatever it is,
you gonna have your story down.
Come on they're gonna public integrity
into this?
What for?
The old woman, her son is
United States Congressman.
I asked where Daryl was. His
grandmother told me.
You didn't at anytime threaten his
grandmother?
No, I did not.
You didn't at anytime threatened
Antoinette Fahringer?
No. I did not.
Think you should know form of complaints
been filed. Alleging you cut off...
Mrs. Fahringer oxygen supply.
Well who's saying that? Mrs. Fahringer?
Is it true?
I think she might be suffering from a
little dementia.
Is it true?
Absolutely not.
I saw 5 of those. I want you to clean
that up.
Ned. Excellent. You got my message.
Good. Come on.
You got the flowers I sent? How's Jenny?
What the fuck are you talking about.
Stop it.
- What are you doing here?
- What do you think?
I don't have anything for you.
- Then this is a problem.
- Yeah well then it's a problem.
You owe me 5 large, Terrence.
I haven't got it.
Give me something, give me goods, if
you dont have cash.

Who are you?
Sit down.
I told you. I'm Dave.
And the guy you robbed,
I know told you he was.
You make a date with a pretty girl,
you gotta pay.
Dear.
Like this.
You see that's it. We engage with another
human being, we remind us we're not alone.
Plus who knows maybe we even learned a
little something.
How much?
You took 10 off to make it right, you
gotta come up with 50.
Bullshit.
It's punitive damages.
What can I tell you.
- I don't get it.
She kept up her end of the bargain.
- He says no.
He's a fucking liar. I did everything
he asked me to do.
- Which was what?
- You want details? Sick people.
Listen to her stand up for herself.
The indignation. I love it.
- Where's the money?
- My bag.
It's all here.
Here are 5,000 and some changes here.
Why dont I give you this and call it a day.
We could do that alternatively I could
tell Jeffy to shoot the dog.
You want me to shoot the fucking dog?
I'll put my calling card on this gorgeous.
I don't give a shit about the dog.
But you mark her up, I'm gonna have a
tough time getting you your money.
By my money you mean $ 50,000.
- I need a couple of days.
- By couple you mean two?
Yeah.
Good
I know, relax.
The boys wanna saddle her up just in the
spirit for friendliness. You mind?
Well, gotta let her clean up.
Put on something hot.
- She looks like shit right now
- Beautiful.
What are you waiting for?
I don't wanna play pressure on you, but
she has a client coming over in 15 minutes.
You boys can be done by then, right?
- The both of us?
- They'd been done in 15 seconds
if you havent mention it.
My mistake.
You'll hear it when we come back.
Two days, same time same station, yes?
Ok, you got it baby.
Don't make me look for you Terrence.
They're gone.
You're taking him to my father's house.
Frankie.
They're gone.
I can't take care of them.
I just need a place where she could stay
for a couple of days.
Why can't you put her in your place.
I can't take a chance this guy found out
where I live, dad. Come on.
Christ!
I get me ajob for bringing the cookies to the
meeting. It takes me half a day to get it done.
You want me to babysit a prost?
You dont have to babysit her.
She's very self sufficient.
I'm not in any kind of shape to take on
something like this.
I get home from one meeting, I lie on a
couch and I wait.
TiI it's time for the next meeting.
That's all I can do right now.
Let your wife deal with her.
They'll get along like sisters.
Get away from me, you fag.
My husband's trying to quit drinking and
you bring this shit into our house?
Give that back, lady or I swear to God,
I will stab you in the heart.
- What's this?
- What kind of trash you bring in here, Terrence?
She's going through my bag.
My personal shit.
Everybody calm down.
- Give it to me.
- He got to put up with narcotics under his nose.
Oh God, Come on, it can't be any worse than
you're being shitface on beer all the time.
You told her I'm shitface all the time?
No
It's pretty fucking obvious, lady.
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.
Well, fucking whore. Watch this.
Come fucking get it.
I can't deal with this shit.
Terrence.
We come in or you come out?
Alright. Come on let's go
Francesca Donnenfeld. You know her?
Just cut the bullshit, and tell me what
you're here for.
I'm Yasco. Here's the thing tough guy.
You just keep fucking with the wrong people.
First, the old lady.
Now, your prostitute friend customer.
The old lady, you might have written
out. She didn't remember so good.
The colored nurse, She's covering for
the grandson, whatever.
But when I get a call from a chief of
D's office. That you're shaken down
your prost friend's customer.
Whose father is hung all the way from
here to fucking city hall.
You're done, Lieutenant.
What do you want?
Your gun for starters.
Huh.
Until the outcome of the hearing,
you're on modified duty.
Better call your delegate.
You have a good day, Lieutenant.
I didn't have a gun.
I know, look you cut the best deal you can
and you get to handle the police department.
Because if you stay in,
it's gonna get worse.
Terrence, can I talk to you for a second.
I can't stay here.
I didn't take the shit from my own mother.
And I'm not gonna take it from her.
Hey, Dad. Can I get a minute alone
with my girlfriend?
She's gonna calm down. I promise.
I'm so happy you're here.
I got something else I wanna show you.
I wanna show you this place.
I spent a lot of time here...
When I was a boy.
I was here alone a lot.
This was my special place...
...as a child.
My castle.
And I would imagine things here.
Pirates, buried treasures.
My dad didn't like that so much,
But my mom, she got it.
Before she died.
She bought me a metal detector.
I wanna show you something.
Look at that. Right out there.
I thought that pirates came up the
Mississippi,
And that they bury treasure right there
by that tree...
Next to the house.
I took the metal detector my mom gave me.
And I went out there and it started
beeping like 'Beep'... 'Beep'... 'Beep'.
I started digging, and I I dug and I
dug and I dug...
And I found a sterling silver spoon.
And I was so happy I started screaming,
and jumping and laughing.
And I went
"Hey Man... this is treasure".
"This is Pirate's treasure."
And I came back here with it.
And I hid it somewhere. I just
Sterling silver spoon.
I still can't find it.
It could be anywhere.
I know it's here.
I don't know what to tell you,
Terrence.
Not a lot I can do in this
circumstances.
I tell you guys all the time, you can
not get away with that cowboy shit
anymore.
You don't listen,
and now this is what we had.
My best fucking detective, and I gotta
put him in the property room.
Terrence, come on.
I don't wanna get you in full of orders.
You do all this Fonz shit, and I'm
here, they're gonna think I'm doing it
too.
So who go to the storage house when
you're not here?
While you're there, get my. 45 Magnum
and bring it to me.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- You work here?
- Looks that way.
Why do you got there?
You see that scale over there?
It's broken.
Useless.
I sent for a new one, as soon it gets here.
I'll weigh the drugs, and I'll get you
your voucher, okay?
Alright, bye bye...
How may I help you, Sir?
May I help you, Sir?
- Can I talk to you a minute?
- Excuse me.
You mind stepping outside?
I'd like to talk to you.
You interrupted my meal.
I'm gonna pretend to be polite, suit
you like a big man in front of your
friends.
But you give me hard times...
...I put the cuffs on you, just like
any other shit bird.
I'll be back.
- You alright?
- What the fuck you wanna talk to me?
You ain't gonna shoot me,
are you motherfucker?
Why would I do that?
I got something for you and I think
you're gonna like it.
Let's take a walk.
You're crazy for coming down here.
I'm gonna give you a chance
to make some money the old fashion way.
With a cop protecting you.
- What I need protection for?
- Other cops.
A cop gonna protect me from cops.
You'll know when a supply is under
surveillance,
You'll know when it's safe to make a
pickup, when it's not.
What do I gotta give you?
$ 15,000 - shipment.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Am I being unfair?
How do I know you ain't looking to set me up?
Tomorrow I'll bring you some information.
Small shit.
You decide if you wanna go to the next step.
What about the murders?
You won't give a fuck about them no more?
Look at me.
Now look at you. I never did.
I got the weight on that dope, finally.
Thanks.
That's all there was?
I'll double check it if you want.
Don't matter,
when that's enough for felony.
Hey where do you guys get going on today?

On Andre's outfit.
Happy hunting.

Yeah, I need to make a stop first.
Is that alright?
Yes.
- This is prime real estate.
- Doesn't look prime.
See that's the point.
Now is the time to get in.
All of this will be river front condos.
Marble floors, health spas...
By that time, another motherfucker
made all the money.
Don't be going legit on me now, Big.
Money is money
Tell you what. You'll be the frontman,
I'll be the power behind the throne.
Just like we work your 4th grader good.
Yeah you're right.
This is a good spot to build condominiums.
See, I know I like you, man.
Come on.
May I ask you to step out of the vehicle
- What I do?
- You bought dope.
I watched you buy dope,

Was that what you're gonna
tell the judge then?
Maybe you'll get lucky, and he'd be a
football fans.
- You know who I am.
- Oh, I know who you are.
Then why you wanna fuck my life for?
I gotta spend a night and that's gonna
knock me out the draft.
I'm sure you'll get a contract or some
kind eventually, Shit!
You run the 4th and what?
Why did you do this to me?
Because of some motherfucking marijuana, man?
I was gonna buy my mama a house.
So.
You're going off 6 points favor against Texas.
You win by 5 or less, or you lose
altogether. None of this ever happened.
Sir, I I can't do that.
A fumble on this assignment.
You can absolutely do it.
Sir, please please don't make me...
Now, listen to me Renaldo.
I've thrown a lot of money this year...
...on you. I gotta chance
to get some of that back,
I want to take advantage of it. You're
gonna tell me your integrity game is too
much to you, Fine...
...I respect that. When a dream of
trying to convince you to go against
your concience.
So turn around, I'm placing you under arrest.
You...
You won't tell nobody.
You ain't gonna tell nobody.
This Taliban shit.
That's what this is.
This does show Osama get a motherfucker
before they blow themselves up.
That's money.
Shut up!
Where's the 15,000?
You'll get it, man. Relax.
Did I not do what I said I was going to do?
Yo, man. Relax.
Tell me again to relax.
I'm not looking to beat you, man.
Where's my money?
- I'll get your money
- When?
- Tomorrow.
- Where?
My place.
Give me a cut of the uncut dope.
Look. I'm gonna pay you in money.
This is interest.
That's bullshit, man.
- What's that little man?
- Yo, Midge, chill out.
Here.
Now put that gun away.
Before you kill somebody.
I'll kill all of you.
To the break of dawn.
To the break of dawn, baby.
What's up?
What's up? What's up? What's up?
- No, don't talk to me...
- What's up motherfucker?
...about no fucking bet, Terrence.
Now what's the matter?
You don't pay your debts, I don't
wanna know you. I can't afford it.
Ten grand. 5 by 0. Yeah? All for
Louisiana. Right there.
- Where did you get this?
- What are you my priest?
- That's a 6 point spread.
- No shit.
Frankie!
Frankie!
- Hi.
- Hi.
- I got something for you.
- I need to get my clothes.
Don't worry about your clothes right
now. This is uncut dope.
Just a bunch of stuff from my closet,
and then from my dresser by the bed.
I'm not gonna give you much until we know
how strong it is. 'Coz it's pure, you know?
Baby, I've been talking to your father a lot.
And I think I'm gonna go to the meeting with him.
Does that mean you don't want any?
I mean, of course I want some but I,
maybe when I get back.
Frankie,
- Ready?
- We gotta go.
Okay.
Thank you
This is the way to do business.
This? This way I ain't gotta worry about
what I'm walking into. I got you.
Let me hit that shit
Yeah.
You eatin' this shit?
Hey, Midget.
Light the Caucasion's swag.
You're my kind of motherfucking cop,
man.
You look crazy, motherfucker.
- Why do you care?
- I'm guessing $ 60,000.
- Pretty good guess.
- Will you shut the fuck up?
You owe me 15,000.
I'll take 25% of the dope uncut.
That means you're getting my price.
There's one way of looking at it.
The other is you get to keep 75%, and I
go to prison for the rest of your life.
Make sure you cut it before you sell it.
Unless you wanna kill the motherfucker
who buys it.
Hey, did I ever tell you story about
Nigger Elk. Nigger Elk, yeah?
I was watching TV, The game, right?
When Renaldo Hayes, he got tossed upon,
He was running with it, running,
running, running.
He jumped over 3 linebacks and in mid air...
He spouted antlers like a gizelle, like an elk.
He landed again, he ran, ran ran.
He scored a touchdown.
I'm not worried about you so I'll be
concern about me.
'cos I'm not concern, You're not
concern, So don't worry 'cos...
I'm not really concern.
I'm worried, because if you drop dead,
I'm the motherfucker they come looking for.
And then I gotta end up having a nigger
from Africa trying to move in on my shit.
I don't wanna shot no more purple ass
niggers from Africa.
- You understand?
- Easy... Easy... 'coz I'm not Eazy-E.
- I need to go to the store.
- So?
So I need you to watch him.
Well. Fuck No! I can't watch him!
Well don't be yellin', They ain't
nothin' to eat then.
Get the fuck out of here.
Get the fuck out of here.
Hit me again with another one of them rocks.
Now what the fuck is that?
It's my lucky crack pipe.
You're a crazy motherfucker.
You don't have a lucky crack pipe?
No.
I don't have a lucky motherfucking crack pipe.
Well then, Donald.
You gotta take a hit off from mine.
Why I gotta do that?
'Cause it's lucky.
Sorry we're late, fellas.
I hope you didn't wait dinner.
- Who the fuck are you?
- 3rd party Ben Fishery.
Your friend here can feel you
in on the details.
I'm working on getting your money,
Dave. That's what I'm doing here.
Yeah, I don't know about you but I find
the hardest part of collecting debts is
having to listen to the stories.
Wait a minute.
Terrence owes you some money?
Fifty thousand dollars.
Plus my two young friends here were
supposed to have had a sexual experience
at their choosing...
...with an attractive woman. Nothing!
He came across with none of it.
Now that's wrong. That's wrong when you
don't do what you say you gonna do,
Terrence
My end of the dope worths more than $ 50,000.
Take it.
Why don't I take all the dope?
What are you gonna take what belongs to me?
Well, there was a time when I wouldn't have.
I'd have taken what's mine
and left the rest on the table.
But you see,
I never got rich enough to retire.
I'm stuck doing this shit.
And I'm not young anymore.
So now I don't leave nothing on the table.
Pick it up.
- Kill him again.
- What for?
His soul is still dancing.
Shoot him again.
What are you doing tonight?
I'm getting out of here and go to bed.
Well just for fun.
Why don't you stop writing report on
Josephine?
- For fun?
- I think you might find something interesting there.
Like what?
I've been thinking this bushwhackers, might've
hit a crack pipe while they were there.
Dropped under the bed where the kids were?
And we missed it?
The DNA place 'em at the scene.
Yeah, the vision, right?
Frankie.
Where's Frankie?
She's not in the house?
- Frankie's on the way to Rehab.
- Rehab?
What about her clothes
Someone bring her, her clothes.
Anything else you wanna know?
You don't have to hide it from me.
Both like a poison.
You just drink beer, I thought.
- I'm gonna watch the game.
- Be my guest.
...and all this without Renaldo Hayes.
We still don't know the nature of his injury...
I'll kill him.
...you know I'm looking right there...
Hayes And I tell you what.
The guy just does not look like a happy guy.
I mean he's on the sideline...
He's obviously suffering
from some sort of injury...
First off, This thing between us is
gotten way out hand, my man.
Got way out of hand.
Okay?
Those goomballs couple fucking assholes.
I take this because of something
you did to 'em?
Woah, man...
I got no beef with you whatsoever.
Everything between me, rinsed with rain.
I want you to know,
That my father got in touch with this
guy, and he told like whoever it is,
That complaint has been withdrawn.
Finished. Oh yeah.
Okay?
Okay.
Oh yeah...
- This way out.
- Oh, yeah.
No... no... Look Ned
If you'd called first I would've save
you the trip. I, I...
I'm guessing, that you didn't see the game.
How did this happen?
Louisiana by 3.
- Hayes ended up playing?
- Nope.
- Worked out anyway.
- What are you talking about?
Nothing.
And my daughter's tickets.
Speeding tickets.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
This female highway patrol officer
calls up says they're taken care of.
It's $ 10,000.
You sure you don't wanna count it?
I trust you.
- Alright, man. You take care of yourself.
- Alright.
- Great news.
- Why?
Armand came up with this at the crime
scene on Josephine.
I was uh... I just got lucky.
Lab found Godshaw's DNA on it.
That is fantastic!
Yes!
Oh... Look at that.
I found the spoon.
It's not silver and little rusty.
I want to give it to you.
It's yours
It's for me?
That's so sweet.
It's beautiful.
Yes, eight.
It's going down, baby.
I got some help.
Police Department. Stand up.
Keep your hands where we can see em.
- What the fuck is this?
- Shut up!
We got it.
Check the outside. Check the backyard.
Check upstairs. Check his car.
We got this. It's okay.
Good. We're good.
- Upstairs.
- Cuff him.
No!
- No!
- What do you mean no?
Here's what happens. Before we can cuff
him, he goes for this weapon,
we shoot this prick and steal his shit.
What the fuck? Terrence...
What are we doing?
I thought we had our thing going.
And you're wrong, baby.
He acts like he likes you,
cause he likes to get high.
That don't mean he stops being the police.
- Cuff him, Stevie.
- No.
I said "Cuff him, Stevie!"
This is about money? You want money?
You want my fucking money? Take my money!
But you won't gotta kill me for this shit.
Go for it, Son.
Go for it.
Go for it. Go for it.
Next time.
Now fucking cuff him.
I said cuff the motherfucker, Stevie.
One year later
Ladies and Gentlemen.
It's an honor to conclude this year
on a positive note.
In recognition of his leadership, and
tenacity, and the investigation of
Ndele family murders,
resulting in successful apprehension,
and prosecution...
...of the 3 individuals responsible
So I'm proud to include Lt. Terrence
McDonagh among those being promoted...

Captain Mc Donagh.
- Excuse me, would you care for some wine?
- No, thank you.
We're all gonna stick
with our sparkling water.
I would like to make a toast.
To the new Captain.
To new life.
- I'm probably gonna start to cry right now.
- Aw... That's okay.
To my new family.
- God Bless!
- Hear, hear...
You're still gonna working the nightshift
when I get closer to the D-Day?
I'll make sure I'm not. How's that.
I can get to the hospital on my own, but...
But I like having you home at night.
I like it better that way too.
- Stand against the wall.
- What did we do?
- Hey! Stand against the wall
- Wait!
What are you doing?
You two match a description.
In passing drugs in a club.
- Sir. You have the...
- Don't say anything.
Do exactly what I tell you to do.
So.
- What are you hiding tonight?
- Nothing.
- We didn't do...
- Empty your pocket and stuffed out the handbag.
- Room Service.
- I didn't order any room service.
Must've make a mistake again.
Holy shit.
I'm Evaristo Chavez, man.
You saved my life.
I was in the prison that was flooding, man.
- Oh yeah.
- Do you remember me?
Are you still with the police department?
Port of Call. Still New Orleans.
Okay.
What happened with you?
Judge amend me to a drug free program.
November 14th.
I'd have a year clean.
Congratulations.
Are you alright?
Sometimes, I had bad days.
Listen. You saved my life.
I'm almost done working. I'm gonna
get you out of here, okay?
Okay?
Does fish have dreams?
You know, Chavez. I still hate that I
ruined my underwear for you.
