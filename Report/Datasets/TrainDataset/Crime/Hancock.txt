Get the Hell out of my face.
Asshole

You heard me.
Asshole!
Watch out!
Hancock is in the car and he appears
to be negotiating with the gunmen
shhhh shhh shhhhhhh
Fellas, fellas
I don't give a shit what
you did. I dont care.
Three guys in the car with
no girls, Rave music
hey, I'm not going to judge
but if you dont pull over and give
yourselves over quietly
I swear to Christ. Your head is going
up the drivers ass
His head, is going up your ass and
you drew the short stick
cause your head is going up my ass.
We've just confirmed there is
chaos here on the 105
Konichiwa

Huh?
You want down?
Ahhh.
I'm real good at down.
I'm Real good at down
Alright?
Alright!
This, Hancocks latest act of so-called
heroics
took a hefty financial toll.
Initial estimates are said to top
Nine Million dollars
Which, if accurate, represents a
personal record for the notoriously
publicity shy Hancock.
Who, as usual, cant be reached
for comment
With all the cracks in the streets,
the fires, the water damage, the fires
L.A. would be a lot better off if this guy
would just leave and let us
get on with our jobs.
He's never asked us for a badge
He's never worked with us in any
capacity
what so-ever. Zero
I dont mind if he could just
do it somewhere else.
New York maybe!
Let them tussel with him for a
while.
What the hell is the crane doing there?
Move the...
The crane's not gonna help idiot!
Iwill break my foot off in your
ass woman
This Hancock guy, is surely on
some kind of mission and he's using
our city to beat himself up for reasons
known only to him....
Sir. Ray Embry
Ray. Pleasure
So?
Ray's like the Bono of P.R.
Actually, Bono is like the Bono of P.R.
but i do try
Well... Lets see it.
Ok
I'll get right into it.
Good morning everyone
I'm here to talk to you about
charitable giving
ok and we all know the way that
that works is you give one maybe
two percent of your net cash and you
get and arm band or a wrist band
or a ribbon or whatever it is
It's nowhere near enough
and thats why we, at Embry Publicity
would like to offer you..
The All Heart symbol.
Now..
you would be among a very select
group
of corporate giants to bare this logo
on your product
and what this would say to the
public
is that your company, Phara Thompsis,
Has made a radical contribution..
to helping our world. And here's
all you need to do to qualify.
Your new T.B. drug, Micodine,
we would like you to give that
product away
for free.
Did you say free?
I did.
Only to those that really need it.
Only to those who, without it,
would other wise die.
well, it is a concept thats up there with..
lethal side effects
Mandatory product recall.
Get indicted, go to jail
Get out, work at IHop for the
rest of your life
Understandable reactions.
A radical concept but.
It is the brand that represents a
fairer and better world
The brand that everyone
is talking about
Who is everyone?
We do already have a sports franchise.
NFL? MBA? MLB?
Soccer.
MLS?
Which team?
Well, It's a local team.
Encino Hurricanes.
My sons team.
Anyway...
We can save the world.
Alright. Someones just gotta go first

bully Michael?
Michele.
Michele huh?

Michele, Hancock is this..
Hancock? Michele is this neighborhood
bully. We've been trying to teach Aaron
about conflict resolution.
hmmm...
Know what i mean?
Yeah, Turn the other cheek
and all that?
Thats exactly right.
uh huh, Well just dont ever turn
that one alright.
Never let them punk you.
Got it.
Ok Aaron. Eat your food.
The way you deal with bullies is you
take you right foot...
bring it right up.. catch him
in his little piss punk.
You dont have to do that honey.
ok?
It's a good idea.
You aim strait..
Make sure he cant use that thing for
nothing but a flap to keep the dust
out of his buttcrack.
Ok, Please.
Just stop. Michele is not a man.
He's a little boy ok. And his parents
happen to be going through a really
bad divorce and
thats why he's acting up.
And maybe you dont know this but
not everything in this world gets
resolved by brute force
Not everything has to be bang, scream,
blood, more blood.
there is just so much distruction..
Angel!
She watches so much news...
That sometimes it gets to be
a little too much.
you got a toilet?
yup.
Yeah, just past the fridge.
Did he... Just take the wiskey
bottle to the bathroom?
Do you want him to kill
us all?
Thanks for coming on in.
Good right?
Very. Yeah. Yeah.
You want to say goodbye to him?
Goodbye Hancock.
Hey, Alright little buddy.

This is some of the stuff
we're going to work on.
How do think that conversation is
going to go down with his mom?
landing like that in the street
is also on the uncool side.
naaa, that was already like
that when i got here.
I live here.
I know what the streets look like.
we're just gonna make those
problems of the past.
Im going to teach you how to
interface with the public.
Where's the wife?
Ahh, Mary took Aaron
to his soccer game.
Hancock,
Pulled some stuff up on YouTube.
A supprising large amount of not great
stuff on you but it's gonna be helpfull
What is this?
Thats me trying to change the world.
Unfortunatly not doing real well.
come on. Lets get to you.
This stuff was on YouTube.
Now, everybody loves a Nutty Buddy
I get it.
But this doesnt work sir.
Hey, give me a Nutty Buddy.
Mom, Mom, MOM!!!
Those are...
Children.
Get that camera out of my
face.
You ever uh...
put out an appartment
fire Ray?
No. I've never done that.
I'm in P.R.
My ass was hot.
Alright. How 'bout this?
This is Walter, the grey whale
everybody remembers him
stuck on the beach in Montezuma
Along comes Hancock...
I dont even remember that. Yeah.. Greenpeace
Does. Walter does.
This all gets redundant after a while,
but my basic diagnosis of your
fundamental problem is..
Wanna hear it?
No.
You're and asshole
I know. I call it like I see it though.
It's not a crime to be an asshole
but it's very counterproductive.
Not a crime but you are an asshole.
dont you think?
Be careful.
Alright, How about this?
I've been thinking about something. This
kinda goes to how you present yourself.
Come on, Really?
It's the middle of the day.
What springs to mind...
When you see this?
Homo
How 'bout that?
Homo in red
Norwegian homo.
I'll give ya that.
Let's move past the comics.
Lets get into something deaper
I think... That deap down you behave
badly because you are lonely
I think deep down you want
peoples acceptance.
come on now, you save peoples
lives and they reject you
so you reject them back.
and we're switch that cycle. We're
gonna start fresh, start new.
This is outstanding. If you turn
some of this power into will-power
Hey Hancock!
We almost won.
Yeah we did. ok, up stairs. I'm
making lunch. Go change.
Hey sweetheart.
were you watching the news?
No. we've been working on Hancock
interfacing with the public.
interfacing with the public.
This has been on all day.
The law, is the law Mr. Hancock.
And you are not above it.
Felony destruction of property
Amounting to tens of millions of dollars,
theft and now this.
From where i sit... I see a selfish self
absorbed man,
With a lot of muscle, but no regard for
anyone but yourself.
Mr Hancock. Let me remind you. You
are not above the law.
You have failed to show at over 600
subpoenas and civil suits.
Anybody else would be held in contempt.
But, Oh no, not you.
You may be a super-hero but let
me tell you this.
You're not nearly as strong as the
U.S. Constitution.
Bank on it buddy!
Genius. Things just got real.
This is exactly what we needed.
This is perfect. Right now there is a D.A.
trying to figure out how to come up here
and put you in jail.
Bitch can try.
I say you go.
People take you for granted you know?
We gotta make people miss you.
People don't like you Hancock.
: I do.
Two weeks. You know? The public will be
clammering for you. When they do..
We'll be ready. And uh, worst case scenario is
I'm wrong and you just fly out of there.
what do you have to lose ?
I apologise to the people of Los Angeles.
But my behavior has been improper
and i accept the consequences.
I ask my fellow Angelinos for their
patience and understanding.
You're and asshole!
Life here can be difficult for me.
After-all I'm the only one of my kind.
During my incarceration I will be
participating in Alcohol and
anger management treatment.
You deserve better from me. I can
be better. I will be better.
Give me the hand playboy.
Oh, I get it.
I put some uh.. well most
of you in here.
I can understand you feeling some
kind of way about that.
Uh.. so... I'm gonna do me. And I'm
gonna let you do you
I.. I.. Dont want no trouble.
Alright?
I just want to go to my cell.
Excuse me.
Excuse me please.
If you don't move..
Your head is going up his ass.
Ya'll fellas sure you want to
ride this train?
Choo Choo asshole.
ohh.
Ohhhhhhh!!!
Did you shove one man's
head up another man's ass?
alright we are gonna circle back to that.
The DA's office wants your
sentence to run 8 years.
it's a big number, but not something
we didn't anticipate
you know our plan is to..
what are you doing?
Hey hey hey  hey hey!
it sounded like you said they want
me to spend 8 years in this shithole?
with good behavior
but it's irrelavant' because with
you out of the picture
and with the crime rate
going up through the roof
The D.A. and the cops are going to
call for your immediate release
and they are going to demand it.
They're gonna ask you..
Where you going? Hey!
Stop right there.
Hancock. Hancock!
Get Back!
You're a coward!
Who you talking to Ray?
I'm talking to you!
Who you talking to Ray?
Stop pretending that you dont care.
You've got a calling. You're a hero
Hancock. You're going to be
miserable the rest of your life
Untill you accept that.
Trust me. Trust this plan. This
process Just stay in here
When they call, A hero is
what we are going to give them.
How we gonna do that Ray?
Aright guys uh.. Lets start sharing.
Don?
Yeah.
You had something?
Yeah I.. I uh.. think i might have
had a little bit of a break-through
Good for you.
Yeah, I realize that breaking necks is easy
but uh.. I'm sitting there
and i'm stairing at myself in the mirror
and I thought...
This is tough.
ha ha ha
Why do you always laugh?
Picturing you look at the mirror
scares the shit out of me.
Everytime I'm talking it
completely ruins the cycle.
lets watch the cross talk.
Ok?
I'm not gonna share anymore
if he keeps doing that.
no no no no no no
Keep sharing. Lets move on.

Could you guys get use to this or what?
How’d you two meet?
Umm.. I was married once before
First wife, a she died giving birth to Aaron
That’s another dinner, but I’ll.. But umm…
So there I am,
I’m with this beautiful little baby and
I don’t know what the hell to do and
I was in the super market and I’m in
the baby aisle
and I got a brand of diapers in each hand
and I’m staring at them like I don’t know how
I’m going to get thorough the day
And Angel
Sees me
She knew and she gave this look
And even in the trance I was in
I knew that somebody; somewhere...
was throwing me a little rope
Well starting that day I put my life back together.
Right?
You’re drunk.
so? Come here.
What about you buddy?
You’re from another planet, aren’t you?
Naw man, I’m from Miami.
You didn’t come in on like a meteor or …?
Nope, woke up in a hospital, first thing I remember.
Government hospital, yes? Experimenting on you and
No Ray, regular ole Miami emergency room.
Come on?
Yeah a my a my a skull was fractured.
They told me I tried to stop a mugging...
Somebody knocked you out?
I guess I was a regular guy before and
when I woke up I was changed.
The hospital nurse tried to put a
needle in my arm and
It just broke against my skin
and then my skull healed in like an hour
Doctors were astounded
And umm they wanted to know my story
Just like you but, I couldn’t tell them
I don’t know who I am
Amnesia.
You know the blow to the head
Yeah well that’s what they figured
You don’t remember anything?
The only thing I had in my pocket was
bubble gum and 2 movie tickets
Boris Karloff, Frankenstein
But no ID, nothing
I went to sign out and the uhh nurse
asked me for my John Hancock
So I actually thought that’s who I was
How come I didn’t hear any of this, read
about it in any newspapers?
It was probably in the papers
about 80 years ago
Oh..  I don’t, I don’t age.. This is it.
That’s nice.
Gotta wonder though
What kind of Bastard must I have been
That nobody was there to claim me?
I mean I’m not the most charming guy in the world
So I’ve been told, but..
Nobody?
That didn’t tire you out at all coming up the stairs?
Not really
you could’ve just flown me up the stairs
wooo, I could have done with out that.
Let’s get your shoes off here.
Alright but that’s all you’re getting
off me though, haha
You believe in me, don’t you Hancock?
Of course Ray, I believe in you.
Help me up here
Listen to me this is important
“Cause I believe in you know and I and
You’re gonna do great
You’re gonna fix everything
You get some sleep Ray
You sleep tight too
Hancock, tucking me in
Alright he’s asleep
Damn babysitter never cleans up after herself
You have a bruise on your hand
You, you should go
It’s getting late
If Ray finds out about me...
You’re dead
Joan, we’re going to take care of that, okay?
Don’t you worry.
Hi Honey, breakfast?
Hancock sneezed, uh?
Can you believe it? Achoo
It’s amazing that you slept through that
You’re a good sleeper
Holy shit
I’m not going to say I told you so but..
You told me he was going to sneeze a hole
through the front of the house?
I just said can’t be around
Oh sweetheart can you get that
Thanks, Oh God you you’re strong.
I got it.
But you don’t worry about anything
I already apologized to the neighbors,
called State Farm
Everything is taken care of.
You just...
enjoy that breakfast
What’s this?  We’re going on vacation?
Uh-hum
Are we?
Just the 3 of us
End of the summer?
Tonight.
Tonight?
Let’s go somewhere.
Knock Knock.
Guzuntight
Uh?
I…I was just telling Ray here
I hope you are done sneezing
Because I don’t think our house
can take much more
Of your sneezing
Yeah.. sometimes uh..
I sneeze when there’s dust
Or if I get really surprised
That’s unfortunate.
This is Killborn
Mike, how ya doing?
It was great to see you too
Yep well uh... right
Go head shoot
Oh I got a pen right here
Right, no I know.

I am warning you
Alright go ahead

Now that’s still…
Hang on one second
Do me a favor?
We are going to talk.
Go away.
I can do this all day…Bong! Bong Bong!!
Shut Up!!!

Fine, we’ll talk okay?
And when we are done talking, you go
away and leave my family alone.
My place at 4 o’clock.
Whatever.

I like to save them for the pitch
So then let’s just set a time
That’s good with me I will see you then
Alright yeah 3:30 great
Hun is it hot in here?
he hurt you didn’t he?
Ahhh… Use your words
How did it make you feel?
Sore.
Bad
Cause he took your power.
And you have to get your power back
And no-one will give your power back
You have to go out and take it
You understand me?
We’re gonna go find Hancock and
Get your power back.
Ask.
You and I?
You and I what?
We’re the same?
No.
I’m stronger
Really?
Oh yeah

Gods, angels, different cultures call
us by different names
Now all of a sudden its super heroes.
there are more of us?
There were
They all died.
Just the two of us
What is this?
Who are we to each other?
We’re brother and sister
That’s a lie.
No I’m your sister
That is a lie.
I’m your sister
No
Sisters don’t kiss brothers the way
you kissed me last night.
You’re lying, deals off
Let’s go see how Ray feels about this.
Get your ass back here!
I’m telling
The All Heart symbol will be known globally,
As a symbol that represents companies
That are committed to changing the world
They can give away there substance goods okay?
Foods, drugs, power, clothing for free.
I thought we were talking about Hancock?
Two…
Stay away from me and my family
You are not going to do this to me again.
What?
I don’t know what you are talking about.
It can’t work.
It always end the same way
Persia, Greece, Brooklyn
Brooklyn?
I’ve never been to Brooklyn.
I have put up with your Bullshit for
the last 3000 years and I’m done.
I don’t know what you are talking about?
Done! You Listening?
I don’t know what you are talking about!
I am happy, okay, finally I’m happy
You are not going to mess it up
Look at me… I don’t know what you are talking about?
I hate to burst your little crazy lady
bubble but it must not
Have been all that great
‘cause I don’t remember you
Call me crazy….
one more time.
Coo coo
Alright hold it…Alright
You better not hit me with that truck
For companies to qualify for the All Heart symbol
they need to prove that the are a leader
in the global revolution.
We gonna talk about Mr. Hancock?
That they are committed to the bettering of
the world And they can do this
in 4 different ways. This is how they…
The most important thing with All Heart is
the Brand recognition That’s why I mocked
up the examples here and
Tokyo, London, Dubai, Paris
So we need maximum exposure
We need extreme marketing
Is it snowing?
Get off me!!
Listen to me
I hate you
I’m sorry
Who ever I am, What ever I did
Look at me
I’m sorry
Why were you flying?
You were flying Mary.
She was definitely flying
Okay I was flying
And I’m very strong as well
It's just the way we are
We?
Me and him, it’s just us now.
The others paired up and died.
You didn’t say anything about the others
pairing up at the trailer.
You were at his trailer?
This is very hard to explain.
Great, I’m all ears Mary.
Me too
Do me a favor
Just give me and my wife one moment please.
Don’t, don’t bring it here Ray
The adults are talking for once second
Technically speaking,
He’s my husband
Hoooooly shit
What?
We broke-up decades ago
long before you were borne.
He just can’t remember
But you can, right?
You knew?
That’s something you might want to
bring up on a first date Mary.
I don’t like to travel, I’m allergic to cats,
I’m immortal, okay?
Those are like some of things you
might want to give a heads up on
What ever we are, we were built in two's, okay?
We’re drawn to each other no matter
how far I run He’s always there
he finds me. Its physics.
What are you saying, are you
are fated to be together?
I’ve lived for a very long time Ray
And the one thing I’ve learned...
fate doesn’t decide everything.
People get to choose.
You chose to let me think I was here alone
I didn’t think you would miss
what you didn’t remember
Great, now what?
I didn’t plan for this

My Zagnut bar versus your gun

What’s happening to me
This just in.. John Hancock has just been
rushed to Los Angeles General Hospital
Hancock is in serious condition with
multiple gunshot wounds
No story yet as to how this happened to him but
We will continue to cover this story
live as it unfolds.
Reporting live from …
From what I’ve heard
he was trying to stop a robbery
Do you know if some special ammunition
was used in the gun that shot him?
No
Some new bullet
No No Not that I’m a aware of
Could this have anything to do with the
mysterious super woman who appeared?
I do not have that answer
You’re becoming mortal
It’s us
Being close to each other
It’s never happened this fast before
You have to leave
The further away you get from me the
better you’re gonna feel
You’ll start getting your powers back
And you’ll be flying and breaking things
And saving people before you know it
It’s like I said, we were built in pairs
And when we get..
close to our opposites we lose power
why?
So we can live human lives
Love, connect
grow old, die
What happened to us?
Summer of ’04 BC,
we were becoming mortal like now
They came after me with swords
You saved me
you pulled me out of the flames
We were living in Miami
And a new movie was playing in town
Frankenstein
And after we walked down Flagler street and
You took my hand and you held it so tight
They attacked us in an alley
They hit you so hard
There was so much blood
They wouldn’t let me ride in the
ambulance with you
And by the time I got to the
hospital you were awake
But you didn’t know me
So I left because every time we’re together..
they come after you through me
You’re built to save people more
than the rest of us
That’s who you are, you are a hero
The insurance policy of the Gods
Keep one alive
you to protect this world.
Mary!!
Mary!
Stay down!
Screams
Mary?
Stop!!
Stay down
Mary!
Help me get her up.
Screams
Both screaming!!
Hold it hold it
I think we are losing her
Heart monitor
Upon us all Hancock,
you're no different
Time to shut her down Hancock
It’s been a nice run
Oh we are all gonna surely miss you
But it is time for you to move on
And maybe to a happier place
You can thank me if you want to
Super hero
