TONY: Okay.
Let's talk business.
This fat bastard is trying
to move in on Maurizio's business.
Now, you know Maurizio
is a reasonable guy.
He just wants a little conversation.
But this guy, he don't
want to hear about it.
Maybe he'll listen to you.
He comes to town every Tuesday.
Are you free Tuesday?
Yeah, I'm free Tuesday.
Nice to see you again, Mr. Jones.
Remember, neatness counts.
You got one half hour.
Ah!
One hour.
Yeah, what?
It's Tonto, downstairs.
There's a guy who wants to talk to you.
What's he look like?
Serious.
LEON:
Tell him I'm coming up.
He's coming up.
Somebody's coming up.
Somebody serious.
Mickey, open your eyes.
We got company.
We got company.
Come on.
Stop, stop, man!
Tonto.
Tell the driver to wait for us out back,
and hurry up.
Hey, sweetie, what's going on?
Don't worry, baby.
It's cool. Take a nap.
Oh, my God.
Those fuckers blocked both the exits.
Check the terrace!
Hey! Yo!
OPERATOR:
I need help.
Somebody's trying to kill me.
All right. Just stay on the line.
I'll just be off a moment.
Sir, I'm gonna connect
you with an officer.
Okay.
Detective Jefferson.
May I help you?
I'll call you back.
Hey, relax, man. I got half of Bolivia
sitting in them suitcases over here.
Ain't even cut yet.
Go ahead, take it. It's yours.
Dial this number.
I'll talk to you later, sweetie, okay?
Bye.
Hello?
It's Maurizio.
Remember me?
Yeah. I mean, no.
Just for today.
So it's safe to say today's
your last day in town
and we'll never see
your fat fucking face again.
Yeah. Right.
He wants to talk to you.
Yes?
Do you understand?
So say it.
I understand.
Good.
Jesus.
Two milk as usual?
Hi.
Why did you hide the cigarette?
This building's full of rats.
I didn't want my old man to find out.
Got enough problems.
What happened?
I fell off my bike.
Hey.
Don't tell my dad about the cigarette, okay?
MALKY:
...why you're doing this to us.
FATHER:
I don't know...
Funny how people got memory problems these days.
I mean, it must be the sun.
You know, a man should know
when to come out of the sun.
I don't know how it happened.
I mean, what's my job?
I'm just a holder.
I hold the stuff just like you give it to me.
I don't look at it, I don't touch it.
I don't even know how to cut it.
Try and follow me, all right?
In June, we gave you the dope.
It tests 100% pure. Now it's July,
we pick up the dope,
and it tests 90% pure.
Now, somewhere between June and July,
I don't know. It's none of my business.
I'm just a holder.
You give me the stuff, I hold the stuff.
That's all I know.
Hey, look, you know,
I'm trying to help you out here,
but, you know,
if you're gonna be a hard-ass about it...
I gotta disturb him.
Now, let me tell you, when he's
into his music, he hates being disturbed.
I'm telling the truth.
I hope so, because he's got a
talent for sniffing out a lie.
It's scary.
It's almost like a sixth sense.
Are you gonna change your tune
or I got to bust into his?
I'm telling you the truth.
All right.
Stan. Stan.
I'm sorry.
See, he said he didn't cut the dope.
Oh!
Of course he didn't.
Just do me a favor.
Find out who did by tomorrow.
Noon.
FATHER: Malky, hey, wait.
Hey, I didn't cut your shit.
Find out yourself!
What the hell are you doing out here?
Get inside and do your homework.
I did it already.
- Oh, yeah? Well, you can get inside
and help your sister
clean up the goddamn house!
And stop smoking cigarettes!
AEROBICS INSTRUCTOR:
Time's up. My turn.
Change the channel,
and I'll smash your face.
So ready for the legs.
And down.
Oh! Sorry, sweetheart.
AEROBICS lINSTRUCTOR:
Good morning, sweetie.
Hi, honey.
Sweetheart, turn that down.
Mama's got a headache.
She took my turn.
She just wants to watch
these goddamn cartoons!
It wouldn't hurt her
to move her ass a bit.
I'm not the one
with a fat ass around here.
Can someone who's doing
nothing all day but watching cartoons
move a little ass and go get some food?
I dare you to say that again.
Margie, I think I screwed up.
It wouldn't be the first time.
I mean, you always come up
with something, right?
Yeah. I think I went
a little too far this time.
I think you're going a little too far right now.
I'm gonna be late for work.
What about working at home today?
Really feel it.
That's it, stomach in.
One...
Shit! She's gonna hit me!
Daddy, she's...
Shit!
Shut the goddamn door!
MAN ON TV:
Fucking bitch.
AEROBICS INSTRUCTOR:
When you use your quadriceps,
your thigh muscles have warmed up your body...
FATHER:
Hey, can somebody answer the phone?
I'm busy!
Hello?
headmistress at the Spencer School
in Wildwood, New Jersey.
Yes, this is she.
Mrs. Lando, when your husband
enrolled Mathilda at Spencer,
Well, as you know, we pride ourselves
in turning troubled girls
But if they are not here,
there is very little we can do.
Now, Mathilda left school
without permission nearly two weeks ago.
I know your husband paid
tuition in advance for a year,
in the rules and regulations
manual we sent you,
you will see that unless there is
a valid excuse for prolonged absence,
She's dead.
FATHER: Tell that fucking kid
to do a little work around here!
Clean up! I'm tired of this fucking mess.
Hurry up!
WOMAN: Taxi!
Why am I feeling when
things could look black
That nothing could
possibly go wrong
This has been
a most unusual day
Love has made me see things
in a different way
Is life always this hard,
or is it just when you're a kid?
Always like this.
Keep it.
MATHILDA: Hey, I'm going grocery shopping.
You want some milk?
One quart or two?
It's two, right?
I like these calm little
moments before the storm.
It reminds me of Beethoven.
Can you hear it?
It's like when you put
your head to the grass,
you can hear it growing.
You can hear the insects.
Do you like Beethoven?
Couldn't really say.
I'm gonna play you some.
Daddy!
Benny, stay here.
Daddy! Daddy!
We said noon.
I've got one minute past.
You don't like Beethoven.
You don't know what you're missing.
Overtures like that
get my juices flowing.
So powerful.
But after his openings,
to be honest,
he does tend to get
a little fucking boring.
That's why I stopped!
Toss the apartment.
You're a Mozart fan.
I love him, too.
I love Mozart!
He was Austrian, you know.
But for this kind of work,
he's a little bit light.
So I tend to go for the heavier guys.
Cool.
Dude, what the fuck are you doing?
Man, keep your bumbaclot mouth shut.
Check out Brahms.
He's good, too.
MAN: What the fuck do
you know about music?
Man, knock it off!
You check the mattress?
Nope.
Wow.
Oh!
Fuck!
Stan.
Jesus. Look what you did.
Stan, you all right? Stan.
STAN: Look what you did!
MALKY: Stan!
Hey, Stan, what are you doing?
What are you doing?
He's dead!
But he ruined my suit.
Yeah, I know, but he's dead.
He's a piece of meat.
Forget about it. Calm down.
I'm calm.
Stay there, all right?
Okay.
Benny! Benny!
Jesus fucking Christ, Benny!
It's Malky and Stan!
Take it easy, all right?
Benny!
Come on, let's get a cigarette, all right?
Benny, we're coming out!
Benny, don't fire!
Get in there!
Jesus fucking Christ, Benny!
You wear something new and...
MALKY: You got a light?
Take it easy.
Stay out there.
What's happening out there?
It's all right, ma'am. Go in.
DEA. Police.
Why don't you leave
that poor family alone?
Everything's all right.
Just calm down.
I am calm. I'm calm.
Why don't you leave them alone?
He said go back inside.
Stan, I think it's better
if we go inside, all right?
MALKY: Benny, turn that kitchen upside down!
Find that shit!
Willy Blood, look what you did!
You killed a four-year-old kid!
Did you really have to do that?
Please open the door.
Please.
Benny, there are three kids here.
I think Stan killed this girl.
And Willy, that asshole,
shot the little boy.
The third one's missing.
Find her.
Shit.
Hey, we missed a little girl, man.
I'm gonna try to find the fucking
super in this goddamn building.
MAN: Shit.
Yo! I found it!
Bingo!
Stan, they found it.
I know.
There it is.
There's cops outside.
We better go.
It's the cops outside.
We better go. You stay here.
What do you want me to tell them?
Tell them we were doing
our job.
LEON: What's your name?
Mathilda.
Sorry about your father.
If somebody didn't do it
one day or another,
I would have probably done it myself.
Your mother, she...
She's not my mother.
My sister,
she wanted to lose some weight anyway.
Bet she never looked better.
She's not even my real sister.
Just a half sister.
Not a good half at that.
If you couldn't stand them,
why are you crying?
Because they killed my brother.
What the hell did he do?
He was four years old.
He never used to cry.
He just used to sit next to me and cuddle.
I was more of a mother to him
than that goddamned pig ever was.
Hey, don't talk like that about pigs.
They're usually much nicer than people.
But they smell like shit.
Not true.
As a matter of fact,
right now I have one in my kitchen,
that's very clean,
and smells very nice.
You don't have a pig in your kitchen.
Yes, I do.
I was just in there,
and I didn't see any goddamn pig.
Don't move.
I'll get him.
Piggy, Piggy, where are you?
There you are.
Hi, Mathilda.
Hi, Piggy.
How are you today?
I've seen better days.
What's your name?
Leon.
Cute name.
You have anyone to go to,
any family anyplace else?
I'm gonna get some more milk.
Holy shit.
Don't touch nothing.
Leon, what exactly
do you do for a living?
Cleaner.
You mean you're a hit man?
Yeah.
Cool.
MATHILDA:
Do you clean anyone?
No women, no kids.
That's the rules.
How much would it cost to hire someone
to get those dirtbags
who killed my brother?
Five grand a head.
Wow.
How about this?
I work for you,
and in exchange,
you teach me how to clean?
What do you think?
I'll clean your place.
I'll do the shopping.
I'll even wash your clothes.
Is it a deal?
No, it's not a deal.
What do you want me to do?
I've got no place to go.
You've had a rough day today.
Go to sleep, and we'll see tomorrow.
Okay?
You've been really great with me, Leon,
and it's not always like that.
You know?
Good night.
Sleep well?
Good.
Because after breakfast
you got to take off.
Where to?
Not my problem.
Read it.
You don't know how to read.
I'm learning,
but I've had a lot of work lately,
so I'm a little behind.
What's it say?
I've decided what to do with my life.
I want to be a cleaner.
You want to be a cleaner.
Here. Take it.
It's a goodbye gift.
Go clean, but not with me.
I work alone.
Understand? Alone.
Bonnie and Clyde didn't work alone.
Thelma and Louise didn't work alone.
And they were the best.
Mathilda, why are you doing this to me?
I've been nothing but nice to you.
I even saved your life yesterday,
right outside the door.
Right.
So now you're responsible for it.
If you saved my life,
you must've saved it for a good reason.
If you throw me out now,
it's like you never opened your door,
like you let me die
right there in front of it.
But you did open it.
So...
Mathilda...
If you don't help me, I'll die tonight.
I can feel it.
Now, I don't want to die tonight.
Mathilda, you're just a little girl.
So don't take it badly,
but I don't think you could do it.
I'm sorry.
How's that?
Mathilda.
Don't you ever do that again
or I'll break your head.
You got that?
Okay.
I don't work like that.
It's not professional.
There is rules.
Okay.
And stop saying "okay" all the time,
okay?
Okay.
Good.
Hi.
You expect to use that in this hotel?
Mister, I have to use it,
because I have an audition
at Juilliard next month
and I have to practice.
Okay, okay, okay,
but not after 10:00.
Okay, I promise.
All right.
I'll put you at the end of the hall,
so that you don't disturb anyone.
And would you fill those out, please?
Oh! Um...
Daddy, can I please fill them out?
You know how I like to check in to hotels.
Thanks, Pop.
I'll bring these back in a minute.
Fourth floor!
Thanks, mister!
You're lucky to have
a little girl that's interested in things.
I have a kid, 17,
does nothing all day long.
Can I leave my plant here
while I take my stuff upstairs?
Of course.
Hi.
I'm putting in a name
of a girl in my class who makes me sick.
If things get hot,
she'll take the heat.
There. Finished.
How old are you?
Want to see my license?
No.
Just look a little younger.
Thanks.
Leon, I want you to teach me
how to be like you.
I want to be strong like you,
smart like you.
Mathilda.
I know I'm not strong enough yet,
but I could learn
the basics, the theory.
What do you think?
Just the theory.
I need this, Leon.
I need time to get my head together.
Yeah, and I need...
a drink.
Don't move.
I'll go get one.
You know, when you told me
to get this baby out for you,
I thought my hearing's going.
I says to myself, "Leon's a pro.
Nobody uses that except beginners."
I like to stay in shape.
Sure. Always stay on top.
It's like me. I got to
know where everything is all the time.
That's why I never leave this place,
except to go from here to there.
Change ain't good, Leon.
You know?
Yeah.
Check it.
Make sure it's the right thing.
I trust you.
One thing's got nothing to do with the other.
Remember that, Leon.
I will.
The rifle is the first weapon
you learn how to use,
because it lets you keep
your distance from the client.
The closer you get to being a pro,
the closer you can get to the client.
The knife, for example,
is the last thing you learn.
Okay?
Okay.
Position.
No.
Never take it off until the last minute.
It reflects light.
They can see you coming
from a mile away.
And always dress down.
Never brighter than the floor, okay?
Okay.
Let's practice now.
It's the best way to learn.
Who should I hit?
Whoever.
I'll be with you in a second.
Give me a few minutes.
Thank you. Thanks a lot.
You guys in the suits get lost.
I don't want to see you, all right?
AGENT ON RADlO:
This has to look natural.
MATHILDA:
No women, no kids, right?
LEON: Right.
Jogger in the yellow and orange?
Okay.
Keep calm.
Don't take your eyes off him.
Breathe easy.
Watch his movement.
Pretend you're running with him.
Try to feel his next movement.
Take a deep breath.
Hold it.
Now.
Ow!
Oh, my God!
Get down!
I'm all right. I'm fine. I'm fine.
AGENT 1:
Get down! Get down!
Where'd that come from?
One shot. Not bad, huh?
What the hell? I'm fine.
I just can't breathe! Get off of me!
AGENT 2: Stay down!
Can we try with real bullets now?
Not today. Let's pack up.
They go like that.
Here. After...
No, thanks.
No discussion.
"It seemed
"to Socrates..."
"To Socrates..."
I'll do it.
Leon, all we do is work.
We need a break.
Let's play a game.
What kind of game?
I have this great game.
It makes you think and it helps your memory.
It's exactly what you need.
Okay.
Like a virgin
Touched for
the very first time
Like a virgin
Okay, who is it?
I don't know.
Okay.
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday,
Mr. President
I don't know.
Moustache.
No.
I'm singing in the rain
Just singing in the rain
What a...
Gene Kelly?
Good. Your turn now.
Huh?
Okay, pilgrim.
Uh...
Clint Eastwood?
I don't know. I give up.
John Wayne.
I was just about to say that.
I swear. It's amazing.
Leon, really brilliant.
Amazing.
MATHILDA:
You love your plant, don't you?
It's my best friend.
Always happy.
No questions.
It is like me, you see.
No roots.
If you really love it, you should
plant it in the middle of a park,
so that it can have roots.
Yeah.
I'm the one you should be watering
if you want me to grow.
You're right.
No! No!
Yes! Yes! Yes!
Wait! Stop!
Stop. Stop!
They gotta be jumping out of the plate.
They gotta be alive.
It's been a long time, Leon.
I missed you.
And you missed some nice jobs, too.
Been training.
Training's good,
but don't overdo it.
You know, training don't
pay as good as working, Leon.
Tony.
All the money I make,
that you keep for me...
You need some money?
No. Just curious.
Because I've been working a long time
and I haven't done anything with my money.
I thought maybe someday
I could use it.
You met a woman.
Leon.
Leon, you got to be
careful with women.
Remember when you
arrived in this country, Leon?
When I took you in, you
were still wet behind the fucking ears,
and already you were in deep shit
because of a woman.
Don't forget that, Leon.
I wish I could sometimes.
You know, about my money,
maybe I could give
a little
to someone.
You know, to help out.
Hey, it's your money.
I mean, I'm just holding it for you,
you know, like a bank.
Except, you know,
better than a bank,
because, you know,
banks always get knocked off.
You know, no one knocks off old Tony.
And besides, with a bank,
there's always tons of forms
to be filled and all that shit.
But old Tony,
nothing to read, nothing to write.
It's all in his head.
I know how to read now.
That's good, Leon. Good.
Your money's here.
Whenever you want it, you just ask me. Okay?
Here's a grand.
No, no. Come on.
It's okay.
I don't need it.
Come on. Take it. Have some fun.
No.
Go ahead. Take it.
Thank you.
All right.
Now let's talk business.
Don't move.
I'll go get the file.
Manolo, a glass of milk
for my friend Leon here.
Listen, Mathilda,
you better be careful.
You can't just speak
to any guy off the street.
Leon, get a grip.
What's the big fucking deal?
I was just smoking a butt
while I was waiting.
I want you to stop cursing.
You can't talk to people
like that all the time.
I want you to make
an effort to talk nice.
Okay.
And I want you to stop smoking.
It will kill you.
Okay.
Stay away from him.
He looks like a weirdo.
Okay.
I'll be out in five minutes.
Stand where I can see you.
Okay.
Leon, I think I'm kind of
falling in love with you.
It's the first time for me,
you know.
How do you know it's love
if you've never been in love before?
'Cause I feel it.
Where?
In my stomach.
It's all warm.
I always had a knot there,
and now it's gone.
Mathilda, I'm glad you
don't have a stomach ache anymore.
I don't think it means anything.
I'm late for work.
I hate being late for work.
Hey, how's the practicing going?
And how are we today, miss?
A little sick of practicing.
Yeah, I understand,
but you're doing all right.
I haven't received
any complaints at all.
Well, I put a cloth over the strings
to lessen the noise.
Oh.
That's very smart.
Not everyone loves music.
I know.
What exactly does your father do?
Well, he's a composer.
That's wonderful.
Except he's not really my father.
He's my lover.
I think I'll go for a walk.
Bye.
What are you doing Saturday night?
What about dinner?
Hey, where are you going?
Visiting friends at 6J.
Okay. Go ahead.
So, what about Saturday?
About 8:00?
WOMAN: I don't know.
You got plans?
I'll meet you here?
We know you're a busy man
and we'll try to make this
as short as possible.
Now, if you'll just
take us step-by-step
through exactly what happened.
The guy was here,
he went for his gun.
Bang. We shot him.
Where exactly were the kids?
I don't know!
They should've been at school,
don't you think?
But in your statement
you said you were the first man in.
Didn't you see any kids?
- The door was broken.
What happened?
Did you follow the procedure?
I lost a good man here.
What the fuck do you want with me?
Cooperation.
I haven't got time for
this Mickey Mouse bullshit.
You want cooperation?
Come up to my office. Room 4602.
Kids should be at school.
- Hey!
STAN: Hey! Hey, come on.
That's my ball.
Hey, give that back.
Come on, where are you going?
Damn, where are you going, man?
That's my ball.
Follow the blue car.
And I suppose you want me to blast the music
and go through the lights, eh?
No.
You're gonna drive slowly.
Take the hundred bucks
and shut the fuck up, okay?
I do not want to fight you,
but you leave me no choice.
MAN 1 ON TV:
MAN 2:
WOMAN:
Welcome back to E! News Daily,<
our 30-minute look at
the latest in entertainment news.
It's for you.
It's a present.
Do you want me to open it?
I'll open it.
How do you like it?
Nice, eh?
MAN: Mr. McGuffin?
Can I have a word with you?
Here. It's for a contract.
Twenty grand, right?
His name is Norman Stansfield,
and he's in Room 4602
in the DEA building,
I'm not taking it.
Why not?
Too heavy.
- Well...
would you rent me
your gear for the day?
I never lend out my gear.
But you still have your gun.
Use it.
Just do me a favor.
Don't shoot out the window. Okay?
Why are you so mean to me?
Wildly killing people
you don't give a shit about.
But you won't get the bastards
that killed my whole family?
Revenge is not good once you're done.
Believe.
It's better to forget.
To forget?
After I've seen the outline
of my brother's body on the floor,
you expect me to forget?
I want to kill those sons of bitches.
I'm gonna blow their fucking heads off.
Nothing's the same
after you've killed someone.
Your life is changed forever.
You have to sleep with one eye open
for the rest of your life.
I don't give a shit about sleeping, Leon.
I want love or death.
That's it.
Love or death.
Get off my case, Mathilda.
I'm tired of your games.
There's a really great game, Leon.
Makes people nicer.
Starts them thinking.
The kind of game you love.
If I win, you keep me
with you for life.
And if you lose?
Go shopping alone, like before.
You're gonna lose, Mathilda.
There's a round in the chamber.
I heard it.
So what?
What's it to you if I end up
with a bullet in the head?
Nothing.
I hope you're not lying, Leon.
I really hope that deep down inside
there's no love in you.
Because if there is just
a little bit of love in you for me,
I think that in a few minutes
you'll regret you never said anything.
I love you, Leon.
I win.
I took a hit.
I need a hand now.
I know she's young,
but she learns fast.
Kids need to be shaped
into something, right?
Yeah, I know. I taught you that.
But ain't there an age limit?
She's 18.
Oh, really?
How about something to drink, Tony?
Yeah, sure. Manolo,
glass of milk for Leon.
Nice tattoo.
Manolo, make that two.
What's that for?
Can't afford to catch cold.
First you find out where the chain is.
You can't see it,
but you can feel it. Here.
I'll ring, you start talking.
What do I say?
Whatever you want.
MAN: Yes?
- Hi.
It's Susan.
I'm sorry. You must have
the wrong door, little girl.
I don't know any Susan.
Move back a little.
I can't see anything.
The light's out.
It's all dark out here.
Mister, I'm scared.
Okay. Okay.
MAN:
What the fuck are you doing?
Open up.
If it leaves your mouth,
I'll pull the trigger.
Here is okay. Let it go.
I said let it go.
Move. Move over.
Easy. Easy.
Easy. Careful.
You want me...
Go ahead. Your turn.
Help me.
Please don't beat me.
Sir? Sir?
Sir? Sir, it's not my dope.
Sir, look l...
A little left, please.
Before... Please...
Okay. Now, the security shot.
No, the second goes
higher on the chest.
Aim for the heart and lungs.
There. Right there.
You see?
The first shot takes him out of order.
The second finishes him off.
- What the fuck...
What are you fucking doing?
Never in the face.
If they can't recognize the client,
you don't get paid.
Because you could take out anybody
and said you did the job.
Got it?
Got it. Never in the face.
Okay. Now you can put the tools away.
What are you fucking doing?
What the fuck is going on?
Hey, mister!
What are you fucking...
You see, when you use the silencer a lot
you have to put a piece of cloth here,
because it gets very hot
and could burn it inside.
A damp, black cloth is the best.
What you doing?
We said no women, no kids.
Who do you think this is gonna kill,
junkies and monkeys?
Now it's clean.
Let's get out of here.
I thought we don't
have the right to drink.
I know, but we're making
an exception for your first time.
Well, if we're making
exceptions for a job well done,
how about a kiss, like in the movies?
No.
Yes.
What you doing?
I'm going to kiss you.
Mathilda, stop, please.
Come on. Just a kiss.
Stop. Everyone is watching us.
Go sit down.
WAlTER: Enjoy.
You don't believe me, do you?
How's that?
When I say I'm in love with you.
Mathilda, please drop it.
Just change the subject, okay?
Okay, okay. Sorry.
So how old were you
when you made your first hit?
Nineteen.
Beat you.
What you doing?
Can't afford to catch a cold.
There's no doorbell.
So knock on the door.
MAN: Yes?
Hi.
I'm looking for Mr. Reuben's apartment,
but it's all dark out here in the hall,
and I'm lost.
MAN: Just a second.
You want more? Come on.
Show your fucking face.
You think you're going
to get me that easily?
Fuck you. Motherfucker.
When it's tough like this,
you know it's gonna be ugly.
Better make it quick or else we'll
be here all day listening to his crap.
MAN: Asshole! Come on, show me
your fucking face, faggot!
Come on, gum trick.
Hey.
What about the ring trick?
You know that one?
MAN: Ring trick? Come on, asshole.
I'm waiting. Show it to me, motherfucker.
LEON: That's the ring trick.
Mario, go back to the barbershop.
We'll finish later.
Hey, Leon, what's up?
All done already?
No, no.
Nicer than people, eh?
TONY: I told you that.
You got a problem?
- No.
Get the chair.
Sit down. Sit.
I was thinking.
If something happens to me someday...
Hey, Leon, nothing's gonna happen to you.
You're indestructible.
Bullets slide off you. You play with them.
Tony, I thought about my money.
You remember the girl
who came here the other day?
Yeah.
Her name is Mathilda.
If anything happens to me,
I'd like you
to give her
my money.
You can count on me, Leon.
Thank you, Tony.
- Yeah.
I won't be long.
Did I do something wrong?
No.
This one is too big.
Yeah, and I only get the leftovers,
is that it?
Mathilda, since I met you,
everything's been different.
So I just need some time alone.
You need some time
to grow up a little.
I finished growing up, Leon.
I just get older.
For me it's the opposite.
I'm old enough.
I need time to grow up.
Shit.
Come on! Come on!
Come on! Hustle!
Good shot.
Come on.
You're new, aren't you?
Fifth floor, right?
You know, you can't
sit here like that.
Really, why not?
Nothing's free.
Like a parking meter.
When you stop, you pay.
It's the law.
Only on TV.
- What'd you say?
Forget it.
How much is your meter?
Ten dollars,
a month.
Got change?
Don't worry about it.
We'll do 10 for 12.
I'll pay now for
the rest of the year, okay?
Okay, a year.
Does paying rent here
mean I have to put up with you guys?
No.
So go play somewhere else.
I need to think.
Stand up.
Don't you like your job?
Food.
Where you going?
Special delivery,
Room 4602.
Sign here.
Come here.
Have a nice weekend, girls.
WOMAN: Thanks.
I'm gonna go to the restroom.
Special delivery?
Let me guess.
Chinese?
Thai, maybe?
I've got it.
Italian food.
What's your name, angel?
Mathilda.
Mathilda.
I want you to put
the sack on the floor.
Good.
And now I want you to tell me
everything you know about Italian food.
And don't forget the name
of the chef who fixed it for me.
Nobody sent me.
I do business for myself.
So this is something
personal, is it?
What filthy piece of shit
did I do now?
You killed my brother.
I'm sorry.
And you want to join him?
No.
It's always the same thing.
It's when you start to
become really afraid of death
that you learn to appreciate life.
Do you like life, sweetheart?
Yes.
That's good.
Because I take no pleasure
in taking a life
if it's from a person
who doesn't care about it.
Stan. Stan. Shit, Stan,
I've been looking all over for you, man,
and I checked upstairs...
What? I'm busy.
It's Malky, man.
He's dead.
Malky was making a buy
for us from the Chinaman.
Yo, but they got
nothing to do with it, man.
They told me this guy came from the outside.
He was a pro.
He was fast.
He fucking came out of nowhere.
Boom, shoots the Chinamen
dead in two seconds.
Easy, man. I'm a cop.
Then turns around,
says something to Malky like...
No women, no kids.
I think it was something personal.
Death is whimsical today.
Blood, do you hear me?
Yeah, man, I hear you, Stan.
Just chill out, man.
Would you take her up to my office?
All right. Yeah.
Jesus fucking Christ.
MATHILDA:
"I know where to find the guys
who killed my brother.
"Their boss is Norman Stansfield
"If something goes wrong,
I left you 20 grand on the table.
"It's for a contract.
Five grand a head, right?
"I know I'll feel better
after I do this.
Wait for me.
I won't be long.
Whoa, I can't park in front like this.
It's a federal building!
He's gonna do the same
exact thing that I said.
MAN: A nine milli.
Bullets.
And another nine milli.
What'd you plan to do
with all these guns?
Maybe she was planning on
taking out the whole building.
Holy shit!
What we got here? Lunch.
Careful, Blood, it might be poisoned.
No, man. There's no anchovies on this.
Is that what you call
"I won't be long"?
I've been hanging around here
for at least 10 minutes.
I did my best.
Do you like it?
Yes.
So say it.
I like it.
Not thirsty?
You know, a girI's first time
is very important.
It determines the rest of her life sexually.
I read that once in
one of my sister's magazines.
My girlfriends told me that
they hated their first experience.
That's because they didn't love the guys.
They just did it to show off.
Afterwards, they started liking it,
like cigarettes.
Will I like it the first time?
Mathilda, no.
Why not?
I just can't.
You love someone else?
No.
I mean...
There was someone
a long time ago.
Before I came to the States.
Her father didn't want her to see me.
She was from a very respectable family.
Mine was,
you know,
not so respectable.
Her dad went nuts every time
she'd take off to see me.
She still snuck off to see you, right?
Right.
See, nothing can stop love, Leon.
He killed her.
One shot through the head.
They kept him in jail for two days,
and they let him go free.
They said it was an accident.
So
one night I waited for him.
Five hundred feet with a lens.
He also had an accident.
The same night I took a boat
and came here
to meet up with my father
who was working for Tony.
I was 19.
Since then I've never left the city,
and I've never had another girlfriend.
You see, Mathilda,
I wouldn't be a good lover.
Okay.
Would you do me one favor?
What?
I'm sick of watching you
sleeping on your chair.
We're gonna share the bed.
I don't think it's a good idea.
MATHILDA: It's okay.
Put your legs up on the bed.
Yeah. That's nice.
Put your head down.
It's okay. Relax.
Good night, Leon.
Good night.
BOY 1:
I want a piece of cake first!
BOY 2:
Hey, come on.
Manolo, take the kids in the kitchen.
I have a lot of respect
for your business, Tony.
When you've killed for us in the past,
we've always been satisfied.
And that's exactly why today
is going to be very, very hard for me.
I hope you'll excuse my mood.
My man was killed
right here on your turf.
And the Chinks tell me that the hit man
was kind of the Italian type.
So we figured that Tony
might know something.
Wait. There's more.
You're gonna love this.
A few hours later, a little
armed to the teeth, with the firm intention
of sending me straight to the morgue.
And do you know who came and
got her in the middle of the afternoon
right there in my building?
The very same Italian hit man.
I'm dying to meet him.
Relax. Everything's fine.
Sleep well?
I never really sleep.
Got one eye open always.
Yeah, I forgot.
You know, I never saw someone
with one eye open snore so much.
I snore?
- Like a baby.
I'm gonna go get some milk for breakfast.
I won't be long.
Don't forget the code
when you come back.
Two knocks, then one, and two knocks again.
Right?
Right.
Ring these up.
I'm gonna go get some milk.
From here on out,
you don't make a sound.
You answer my questions by nodding yes
or shaking your head no. You got it?
Is he alone?
Does he expect you?
Do you have keys to the apartment?
Is there a code, a way of knocking,
so he knows it's you?
Alpha team.
Final position.
We're ready to go.
Be careful.
Leon! Leon!
What up? What up?
Move! Move! Fuck.
Shit.
Alpha team.
Man down. Man down.
I told you.
Benny.
Bring me everyone.
What do you mean, "Everyone"?
Everyone!
Take this.
Uh...
Go take a look.
Don't move.
Do you see anything?
It's the guy. He's here.
He's got a gun to my head.
Okay, nobody moves.
Let the girl go.
Now, take it easy, man!
Let the girl go.
Okay, the girl's coming out.
Let the girl go.
Grab the ax off the wall.
Over there. Go!
You're coming with us.
Christ, he shot him!
Bastard!
Move, move, move, move!
Shut the fucking water off!
Got it.
LEON: Come!
We're in a bad way here. Send the Cats.
I repeat. Send the Cats.
I don't know what happened.
I didn't see them coming, I swear!
I just went shopping and I came back,
and they were everywhere.
Stay away from the window.
Leon.
Come here.
Snipers.
Okay, now, get this fucking asshole out of there.
How are we gonna get out of here now?
Leave it to me.
We're checking out.
But, Leon, it's not big enough for you.
It's barely big enough for me.
We said no discussion.
No, I'm not letting...
Listen...
I'm not going! I won't go!
- Listen...
Listen to me. Listen to me.
Listen to me.
I won't go!
We have no chance together.
But if I'm alone, I can do it.
Trust me.
I'm in good shape, Mathilda.
I know I've got a lot of money with Tony.
A lot. We'll take it and leave together,
just the two of us.
Okay? Go.
No. You're just saying that
so I won't worry.
I don't wanna lose you, Leon.
You're not gonna lose me, Mathilda.
You've given me a taste for life.
I wanna be happy,
sleep in a bed, have roots.
You'll never be alone again, Mathilda.
Please, go now, baby. Go.
Calm down. Go now. Go.
Go.
See you at Tony's. I'm gonna clean them all.
Tony's in an hour.
I love you, Mathilda.
I love you, too, Leon.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
what the fuck is going on up there?
I just said take the guy out,
not the whole fucking building.
Hey, we've got one breathing here!
Get a medic on the horn!
Clear the hall!
Let him through!
We've got a wounded man here.
Make way!
Down those stairs.
Let's go! Move!
Get that guy off the stairs!
Leave him on the landing.
Get your team back up there!
I got him!
We've got two men
coming down the stairs. Let's hurry!
You okay?
Hey, I need a medic over here!
Move your fucking asses.
Squad Number One,
what's the status on the apartment?
MAN: Can't see shit. Too much smoke in here.
Give us five minutes to clear it out.
Okay. You got it.
What, what, what? You're 200 men
and you can't find one man and a girl?
Did you find the girl?
Hi, how are you doing?
Take your mask off, quick.
Let me see you. That's deep.
Right. And this one here...
You're from the 3rd Precinct?
Yeah.
MEDlC: All right,
let's open up his sleeve a little bit.
All right, fine. Put it down.
Put it down. This one.
You stay there for two minutes.
I'll be right back.
Let me put the mask back on.
I breathe better with it.
Okay. You're all right.
Sit tight.
Okay, come on, everybody out!
Come on, let's go, let's go, let's go!
Come on. Out!
MAN: Clear the way.
Clear the way, men.
COP: Come on. What are you doing here?
Get out. Get out. Come on.
Stansfield.
At your service.
This is from
Mathilda.
Shit.
Get out of here!
Leon asked me to help you out
if something happened,
and I think something happened, right?
He put aside a little cash for you.
So what I'm suggesting is that
seeing as how you're still so young,
I should hold the money
for you until you're older.
Like a bank, you know,
except it's better than a bank, 'cause,
you know, banks always get knocked off.
No one knocks off old Tony.
But it's your money.
In the meantime, all you gotta do
is come here
every once in a while and I'll dish it out
so you can have a little fun, okay?
Here.
Here's a hundred bucks to start with.
Can't I get a job instead?
A job?
What the hell can you do?
I can clean.
I ain't got no work for a 12-year-old kid,
so get it out of your goddamn head!
It's over! The game's over!
Leo's dead!
You hear me?
Come on.
You think I ain't hurting, too?
But he's dead.
You're gonna forget all this craziness
and get your little ass back to school.
Now take this money
and get the hell out of here.
And don't let me see
your face till next month,
'cause something tells me
I'm about to lose my famous kind streak.
My parents
died in a car accident four weeks ago.
It was terrible.
You know, we didn't have the time
to get to know one another
when you first came here,
but I want you to know that
I'm not the kind of woman who'd let down a child,
whatever her situation,
whatever her mistake.
So I'm going to help you and
do my best to welcome you here again.
But on one condition.
You have to stop lying to me, Mathilda.
I want you to take a chance
and trust me.
Now, tell me what happened to you.
Okay.
My family got shot down by DEA officers
because of a drug problem.
I lived with the greatest guy on Earth.
He was a hit man, the best in town,
but he died this morning.
And if you don't help me,
I'll be dead by tonight.
You know her?
No. I've never seen her.
I think we'll be okay here, Leon.
He deals the cards
as a meditation
And those he plays
never suspect
He doesn't play
for the money he wins
He deals the cards
to find the answer
The sacred geometry
of chance
The hidden law
of a probable outcome
I know that the spades
are the swords of a soldier
I know that the clubs
are weapons of war
I know that diamonds
mean money for this art
But that's not the shape
of my heart
He may play
the jack of diamonds
He may lay
the queen of spades
He may conceal
a king in his hand
I know that the spades
are the swords of a soldier
I know that the clubs
are weapons of war
I know that diamonds
mean money for this art
But that's not the shape
of my heart
And if I told you
that I loved you
You'd maybe think
there's something wrong
I'm not a man
of too many faces
Like those who curse
their luck in too many places
I know that the spades
are the swords of a soldier
I know that the clubs
is weapons of war
I know that diamonds
mean money for this art
But that's not the shape
of my heart
