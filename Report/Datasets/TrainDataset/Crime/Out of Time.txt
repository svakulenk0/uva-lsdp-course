LENO ON TV:
Chief Whitlock.
All right.
Be right over, ma'am.
How you doing,
Miss Harrison?
Chief.
You okay?
I'm fine.
Mind if I come in?
Come in.
Thank you.
Oh, boy.
Did you, uh... you get a
good look at this fella?
Uh, yeah.
He was, um...
About your height.
Mm-hmm.
Your weight.
Come to think of it,
he kind of looked like you.
Looked like me?
So he was good-looking?
No.
Okay.
Sorry. Just not my type.
So this "ugly" man--
you know how he got
in the house?
Um...
The bedroom window.
It's all right
if I come in your bedroom?
Yeah. Come in.
Why don't you tell me
what happened?
Okay. I was asleep.
But, um, then I woke up
'cause I felt something.
I saw the window was open...
And he was standing
right where you are.
Right here?
Mm-hmm.
You sure? Okay...
All right,
so what did he do?
He, uh...
He came toward me.
He came toward you?
Uh-huh.
Like this?
Uh-huh.
Then he grabbed me.
Where?
Right here.
Like that?
Uh-huh.
But he was much stronger than you.
Like that?
Uh-huh.
He forced himself
on top of me.
Like that?
His breath smelled like
he'd been drinking on the
job, kind of like yours.
Really?
What happened next?
He kissed me.
Where?
Where, baby?
And he stripped me naked.
I was confused.
He ripped my shirt off.
You didn't put up
much of a fight, did you?
Oh, really?
I didn't put up
much of a fight?
So you took control?
What did you do next?
What did you do, baby?
Watch me.
Tell me what
you did next, baby.
Oh...
POLICE RADIO: Chief, you've got
to get down to the scuttlebutt.
Yeah, Tony, what's up?
Can you get here?
We need you to come quick.
Okay. Um...
Look, Tony, I'm...
Coming now.
No.
I've got to go, baby.
I've got to go.
I've got to go to work.
So we'll pick up
on this crime tomorrow?
Okay.
What kind of crime?
Assault with
a deadly weapon.
Breaking and entering.
See you later, baby.
How y'all doing?
Good, chief.
Matt.
Morning.
Hey, Matt.
Mathias Lee Whitlock.
How you doing, Chris?
You having breakfast
with all your friends here?
I would invite you, Chris,
but I don't want to.
I'd sit down,
but I don't want to.
ANN:
Did they find us a table?
Yeah, we're in the back.
Matt.
How you doing, Ann?
Okay. I'm starving.
Good to see you.
Good to see you, too.
Hey, Chris, try the crab.
It's real good.
I'm allergic.
I know.
Right.
How you doing, Sharlene?
Hey, chief.
What time is it?
It's 3:00.
Hey, man, you're
out of paper towels again.
How you doing, Chae?
Good.
Thought the camera
only added ten pounds.
Looks good, doesn't it?
Kind of, in a pudgy way.
I thought this might
be an opportune time
to revisit my offer to invest
in that little business venture.
Costa Rica?
Yeah. Chartered fishing boat.
Steal the evidence money?
What's this?
You file a report on that yet?
Is that it?
That's it.
Can I touch it?
No, you can't.
I just want to touch it.
Get your hands out of there.
Maybe I'll just steal it.
Maybe I'll just shoot you.
Stop thinking like a cop.
Just listen to my proposition.
We'll take a grand out.
We'll go to the boat show.
We'll just walk around
with the money in our pocket,
get a sense
of what it feels like
to know we could buy a boat,
if we were of a mind to.
I'll see you in a minute.
What do you think?
Chae.
Stranger.
How you doing?
How you doing, Alex?
I need your keys.
I'm fine, thanks for asking.
How about you?
Listen, I need your keys.
I left a couple of things.
Okay. I'll go with you.
No. Uh-uh.
Why not?
I just want to go with you.
I don't want to get into anything.
I've got a lot of work to do.
I know your work is important.
Are you going to start with that?
I'm gonna go in the other room and
pretend to make a phone call.
Congrats on making detective.
Thanks, Chae.
Forget it.
Forget it.
Even if I left the
hope diamond in there,
it's just not worth it.
Bye, Matt.
Good-bye, Alex.
Would you just give me
the goddamn keys?
They're on the desk
right in front of you.
I'll drop them off.
Oh!
See you, Chae.
See you, sweetie.
She looks good.
Sometimes I think you
want me to shoot you, Chae.
Wait. Hold that thought.
Medical examiner.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. All right.
What kind of prick dies
at cocktail hour on a Friday?
The nerve of some people.
Have a good one, Chae.
Yeah, see you.
Catch anything?
Hey!
Hey.
Trying to catch my self-respect.
Figuring out what it is I'm doing
in the middle of
this...threesome.
Try foursome.
You're forgetting your wife.
She left me.
I told her the other day--
I told her today--
come get her stuff.
So, how's the pro
football quarterback?
He's up north
hunting for the weekend.
The whole weekend.
I got a splinter
in my butt.
You okay?
I'm okay.
I'm definitely okay.
It's all right.
You still love her, don't you?
Huh?
You still love her,
don't you?
Yeah, I do.
Yeah, you do. Will you divorce her?
You still got your ring on.
Chris needs me.
Oh, okay.
He does.
He's lost, been that way
since he got cut from the team.
I feel sorry for him.
Remember that the next time
he goes upside your head.
Hello.
Mm-hmm.
Okay. Sure.
All right.
I'll be right there.
Ann Merai. Hi.
Dr. Frieland.
This is my brother Matt.
Nice to meet you.
I'm sorry to
bring you in today.
I was in surgery all day yesterday.
Please.
You can talk in front of him.
It's fine.
Okay.
Right. Okay.
Ann, I'm afraid there's been
a bit of a setback.
I had your tests back yesterday.
The cancer is not in remission.
It's come back very aggressively.
It's attacked
your liver and lungs.
How--how long?
Well, that's difficult to say.
How long?
Five, six months.
No one can say for sure.
But I feel--
I feel fine.
Listen...
There's a counselor here
at the hospital
I'd like you to see.
She's very good.
She'll help you during this period.
Thank you for coming in
on your day off.
Ann, wait.
Excuse me.
Maybe you could speak to
her about the counseling?
Listen, you should be able
to do something, right?
What about that experimental stuff?
You know, like
I don't know.
I mean, there are
alternative approaches.
Yeah?
Sure.
I mean, let's see...
Autologous cancer vaccines,
hematology procedures,
hyperthermia treatments.
Here. Take a look at those.
They're extremely expensive,
and there are no guarantees.
Thanks.
Okay.
You all right?
Yeah.
Why didn't you tell me, baby?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
When I was with you, I--
I forgot about it.
For a couple hours,
I didn't think about dying.
I understand.
You know, they've got
this alternative stuff.
There's a clinic in
Switzerland, and they say--
I know. With my blood.
I don't put much stock
in all that stuff.
They said there's
a 17% success rate.
A whole 17%?
Odds are better
I'd hit the lottery,
which is what I'd have to do
to afford something like that.
Now listen.
Where are you going?
I don't think we should
do this anymore.
Ann. Ann.
It wasn't right for me
to drag you into this.
You didn't drag me into anything.
I'm a big boy.
Matt, I'm dying.
I'm dying.
ANN: Thanks for the flowers.
MATT: You're welcome.
The girls at work
were so jealous.
Glad to hear that. I know
that's not why you called me.
What's up?
What's up?
I wanted to show you
something.
Chris didn't hit you
again, did he?
No.
When we were married,
we took out insurance policies
on each other,
but they were only
for $100,000.
This says $1 million.
Did you know about this?
No. I remember
signing some things,
but I didn't know
he made any changes.
He can't get away with this.
This is fraud. You were sick.
No. I was diagnosed
six months ago.
Chris increased the policy
almost a year ago,
right after my 32nd birthday.
My mother was 33
when she died of cancer.
Oh, no.
That Chris?
He's here.
Maybe he can explain this.
No.
Why not? Now's the time.
This is not the time.
When is the time?
I don't know.
Please. I'm sorry, baby.
Hey.
Hey.
I'm just taking the trash out.
Thought you were working
a double tonight.
Yeah, I bet you did.
How was your appointment
on Saturday?
Appointment?
Yeah, with Dr. Frieland.
I didn't have an appointment.
No? You sure?
I'm sure.
'Cause Jay saw you
go inside his office.
You were going inside
with some other guy.
No, I just stopped by.
I had to ask some questions.
Now you were there.
I was there, but I had
to ask him some questions.
Here we go
with the lies again.
I'm not lying to you.
Yes, you are!
Start telling me the truth!
You're hurting me!
Why do you make me do this?
I'm not making you
do anything!
It ain't my goddamn fault!
It ain't my fault!
Chris, how you doing,
football player?
Good, Mathias.
How you doing?
I'm good.
Judy Anderson called,
said she saw a prowler
in the neighborhood.
You see anything?
Nah.
No?
Mm-mmm.
What about your wife?
She home?
She didn't see anything.
You didn't ask her, Chris.
She didn't say anything
about it.
Maybe I should ask her, not that
I don't trust your mind-reading.
Hey, Ann, how you doing?
I didn't see anything.
Okay?
Okay.
I'm gonna just
check the perimeter.
Go ahead.
You see somebody, you holler, okay?
Oh, yeah.
Ann?
Mm-hmm.
You have a good night.
ALEX: We did it.
This wasn't necessary.
My name shouldn't be on your house.
I'll buy my own in a few years.
All right.
Chief Whitlock.
I've found a way to go to
that clinic in Switzerland.
Right.
Hold on.
Forget it.
Excuse me. I'm sorry.
You know, I got to go.
Tell her I say hi. Bye.
Hello.
Yeah. It's no problem.
I name you the beneficiary
of my life insurance policy.
MAN: No, no.
Not me personally.
You name the living gift
as your beneficiary
after we purchase
the policy from you.
And you--
I mean, the living gift--
collects on the policy
when I die.
As the beneficiary, yes,
we collect on the policy.
So you make
a profit if she dies?
Is that legal?
We wouldn't be here if it wasn't.
How much do I get?
I know the amount depends on
how long your medical staff
says I have to live.
How about a ballpark figure?
MATT: $750,000.
I know.
Even if they have to repeat
the treatment several times,
there would still be enough money
left over for us to go somewhere.
Like the conch festival
in key west?
No.
Clambake in Opa Locka?
No! Europe.
Europe?
Yeah. Or Africa.
I'm going to beat this.
You watch.
Richard petty,
give me a hand.
Hey, man, watch it.
Don't slip. Watch that blood.
Come on, Ann, talk to me.
Their investors won't let them
buy any new policies.
The living gift?
Mm-hmm.
We can go somewhere else.
We'll get somebody else
to buy it.
I can't. There's only
two days left to change it.
What do you mean?
A provision says the beneficiary
can't be changed after a year,
and that's in two days.
Well, maybe we
could call down...
It's too late!
Ann, listen...
Don't, don't. Don't.
This is not fixable.
Just go, Matt.
Just go.
What the hell did Alex pick up
from your place the other day?
I don't know.
Well, over for sure now, huh?
She left something so she'd
have a chance to come see you,
see if she still had feelings.
Based on what I saw, she didn't
have any feelings... except anger.
Think you've had enough.
I'm trying to help you here.
One of your patrons
has been overserved.
I may have to cite you
on that, Helena.
See you tomorrow, Chae.
See you tomorrow.
Man. Bustin' my chops,
Mr. Drinking-on-duty.
I'll see you later.
Good night.
Take it easy.
Let me get you
a refill, chief.
No, I'm good, Chris.
It ain't a bribe,
just a beer.
Two, whatever
he was just drinking.
Thank you.
Let me ask you something.
That night you were out there
looking for that prowler,
did you see anybody?
No, I didn't.
'Cause I had this feeling
when I got home that...
Ann was with
some other guy.
Really?
I think he snuck out the back
when I got home.
No, I didn't--
I didn't see anybody.
I'll tell you what,
though.
Next time that little
pussy comes around...
Little pussy?
Sure. The guy scurries
out the back door
the second
he hears my voice.
"Scurries?"
Yeah.
You know, I could
almost respect a man
who had the balls
to confront me,
tell me, "yeah,
I'm banging your wife."
Maybe this--this--
this guy,
maybe there's nothing
he would rather do
than, you know,
to tell you
that you're a lousy husband
and you don't deserve Ann.
Maybe there's nothing
he would rather do
than to walk up into your face,
look you in the eye,
and say to you, "Chris,
I'm banging your wife...
Good."
Maybe. You know, maybe...
Maybe your wife won't let him.
I'd respect him at least.
And if he did that,
then I'd go up to him,
look him in his eye,
and I'd say,
"just come near her again...
And I'll kill you."
Oh, Chris. Wow.
You're talking to the wrong guy,
because, as a police officer,
I can't let you go around
threatening people's lives.
If you're serious,
then I'd be obligated
to do something about it.
Really?
That's right.
Thanks for the beer...
And the conversation.
Thanks for listening.
You give Ann my best...
If you can.
You been waiting long?
Hi.
Sorry about last night.
Okay.
You must really
be mad at me.
God, I used to love
coming out here with you.
I thought I was the shit,
being a freshman
making out with a senior.
You were.
Still are.
I guess I was, huh?
Here.
What's this?
My going-away present.
Going away?
Insurance policy.
Making me
the beneficiary?
Come on, Ann.
Yes, you can.
Buy that fishing boat
you and Chae
have always talked about.
Right.
Here.
No. I'm leaving tomorrow.
What?
I'm leaving town tomorrow.
And, um...
I've got to
get out of here.
I need to get away
from Chris.
I need some peace.
Chief Whitlock.
How can I help you?
You just did, buddy.
How you doing?
Good.
Take this.
Meet me at my house.
What is it?
It's a gift to you.
Switzerland.
What?
It's money.
What money?
That drug money?
Matt, no, no.
Oh, my God.
What if they want it back?
By law, the money
has to stay in the custody
of the arresting department until
the appeals process is over.
With the money Scarcetti has,
it could take years.
But Tony and the guys--
they think I'm putting it
in a safe deposit box.
What time does
Chris get home?
Uh...11:30.
Go to your house, pack a bag,
meet me at my house, 11:00.
You okay?
Uh-huh.
See you later.
WHITLOCK:
Ann?
Oh, hey...
What are you doing here?
Barbara's pissed off
about something.
Got to wait her out.
Listen, listen.
You see anybody
come in here?
No.
You sure?
Okay. Why don't you
head over to the Scuttlebutt?
They cut me off,
no thanks to you.
Just tell them chief Whitlock
said everything's okay.
That's the first place
Barbara's going to look!
She won't look there.
Yes, she will!
I've got half a pack
of cigarettes in there!
Lieutenant, tell engine two
to lay it out
and start attacking it
from the back!
Go, go!
Pull it up!
Let's get moving!
POLICE RADIO:
Go! Go! Let's keep moving!
Aim the hose right there!
Yeah, I got that covered.
RADIO:
Mathias, you all right?
I know it's hard to take.
I'll grab you
a cup of coffee.
Was it an accident?
I don't know. Maybe.
These propane tanks
just don't blow for no reason.
Man, this place
was an inferno.
Those poor folks
didn't have a chance.
Hi, chief.
Chief.
What are you doing here?
I'm a homicide detective,
and there's two dead bodies.
So what happened?
They think the propane tank blew.
You know who they are?
I think it's definitely "were."
ALEX:
Right, Chae.
Hey, Mathias, check it out.
Definitely arson.
It's definitely arson.
Definitely.
I'm thinking the closer I stay
to the scene, the better.
Yeah, it's possibly
a double homicide.
We're gonna have to
take this thing over.
Chief?
Yeah.
Chief, Judy Anderson's mom
is visiting from Orlando.
Last night, Judy said her mom
saw somebody sneaking around.
I checked it out,
I didn't see anything.
We should probably tell Alex.
I'll tell her.
You get back to the office.
Hey, chief, they want me
to run my investigation
out of your place
for the next 24.
I'm going to
need your help--
background on the vics,
people they knew.
A tour guide?
Pretty much. You cool with that?
Okay. No problem.
Are you sure?
No problem at all.
Why don't we ride back and you
fill me in on the Harrisons?
My boys will set up
at your place.
Okay.
Great.
I just wanted to say I'm
really sorry about the timing.
What do you mean?
With the papers,
and then this today.
The divorce papers?
I should have
called you before.
That would have been nice.
I know.
But it has been eight months.
Don't you think
we need some closure?
I really don't want
to talk about it.
Thanks for opening up.
So let's talk
about the Harrisons, then.
Either of them
screwing around on the side?
I don't know. Is anybody
happily married these days?
MAN: These have already
been gone through.
Right. He was supposed
to get off at 11:30.
Right. Mr. Harrison.
So you don't know if Mr. Harrison
even came to work or not.
Hold on one second.
Did you know she worked as a
dental hygienist for a Dr. Shider?
Really? No.
I'm going to pay him a visit.
You want to come?
Okay.
Okay. Thanks.
So she quit yesterday?
Well, kind of.
Ann Merai had terminal cancer.
Really?
I think she was trying
to keep it quiet.
Anything else
you could tell us?
I think she was
having an affair.
Did she actually tell you
she was having an affair?
We don't really talk a lot,
mainly what's happening
on our stories
and stuff like that,
but I just got the feeling.
Like, sometimes when
she'd be on the phone,
she would talk real quiet.
Whisper?
Did you ever see him,
or did she ever
tell you who he was?
No, no.
But--but he was classy.
About a week ago, she got this big
thing of flowers from Rosie's.
Really nice.
It was beautiful.
Remember, Bruce?
But I met her husband once,
and he just doesn't seem
like the type to send flowers.
Right.
Rosie! Chief Whitlock.
Listen, we're trying to find out
if some flowers were sent
to an Ann Merai Harrison
last week, sent to her office.
Harrison. Check and see
if one of your guys sent them.
WOMAN:
Mercy Med.
Ah!
Chris Harrison.
Her husband.
Okay. Thanks a lot, Rosie.
Yeah. No, that's all.
Okay. Thank you, Rosie.
You ready?
I guess so.
Okay. All right.
Thank you for your help.
Sure.
Thank you.
If you think of anything else,
here's my card. Thanks a lot.
Please don't do me like that.
You knew I wasn't finished.
I'm sorry.
Dr. Shider gave me the name
of Ann Merai's doctor.
I want to find out more
about her cancer.
You can drop me off
back at the station.
You really don't like
being around me, do you?
No, no. I just, you know...
There isn't any reason
for both of us
to be wasting time
at the doctor's office.
What's so pressing
that you have to do?
I do have a job.
I am chief of police.
Yeah, of a four-person
department, Matt.
See, that's the problem
between the two of us.
You think your job
is more important than my job.
Never said that.
Yeah, you did.
You never say it directly,
but in indirect ways you say it.
You wanted to leave
Banyan Key, go to Miami
so we could be closer
to  important job.
You never said the commute
was taking time away from us?
I didn't have a problem with that.
You didn't?
So I'm hearing things now?
Whatever.
Is that the reason
you're not coming with me?
Is that your date paging you?
One of my four officers checked in.
It's a tracking device.
And you can tell on that?
That's what it tells me. GPS.
We're all tied in to it.
The mayor's brother sells them,
so we spent
half the budget on them.
See, if we were moving,
you'd see it tracking.
Sorry.
If we were moving right now,
it would show us tracking.
Great.
Why don't we drive
to the doctor's office,
and I can see how it works?
Okay.
Okay.
Thank you.
I'm going to the bathroom.
I'll meet you in there.
Hi.
May I help you?
Yeah. Dr. Donovan's office.
Her office
is on the third floor.
Thank you, Ramona.
Ann Harrison
didn't have cancer.
Are you sure?
Not counting the time
she spent in Atlanta,
Ann Merai has been my patient
since Junior high school.
If she had cancer,
I would have known.
I don't get it.
Maybe she saw
another doctor.
She was here for her yearly
when she first got back to town
two months ago,
and she was healthy
as a proverbial horse.
I'm looking it
over here, and...
I don't understand.
Who told you she had cancer?
Excuse me.
So...
Can I help you?
Yeah, I'm looking
for Dr. Frieland.
You're looking at him.
You're Dr. Frieland?
Yes, I am.
Hold on, pop.
You're sure?
This is your office?
It has been
for ten years, yes.
Look, I'll get back to you.
Do you have a patient named
Ann Merai Harrison?
I really can't
tell you that.
You can tell me.
Was she your patient or not?
Was she
your patient or not?
You don't understand--
was she
your patient or not?
No, I've never had
a patient by that name.
You sure?
Yes, I'm sure, very sure.
Yeah, I would know that.
Okay, I'm sorry.
That your pen?
Pen? Yes.
Do you use it much?
No, not very much.
You don't mind
if I take it, do you?
No, you can have the pen.
Sure. It's yours.
Take it. It's yours.
ALEX:
Right.
Right.
I know that part.
Hang on one sec.
Did you get a checkup
or something?
No, just bad coffee.
All right.
No, just tell them they've
got to stop lagging.
We need
those phone records now.
All right. Thanks.
You all right?
Yeah.
We all good? Fantastic.
How's this, ma'am?
You fixed his nose already?
Just wonderful.
Hey, chief.
Hey.
How you doing, Judy?
I'm fine, thanks,
considering...
Alex, we've got
an eyewitness here.
Mr. Anderson, this is
detective Diaz-Whitlock.
Well, just...
We're on top of it.
Chief, I told them how
Judy's ma saw somebody
sneaking around the
Harrison place last night.
Got them right over there
sketching it out for us.
...the guy she saw
outside her window...
That's her right there?
Okay, all right. Good job, T.
Chief,
check this out.
Sketch of a prowler out to
the Harrison's last night.
Yeah.
Ring any bells?
Hi, Tony.
No. I mean, no.
He looked like him.
Like who?
Like him.
Like me?
Yeah, yeah. You.
Mom, he's the chief of police.
So he was black, ma'am?
Yeah, he was black.
Wait a minute.
Maybe...
Maybe him.
Mrs. Anderson, thank you.
Thank you very, very much.
Anyway...
I'm so sorry.
Mother was raised
in a different time.
Don't worry about it.
We're on top of it, okay?
I need to talk to you.
I appreciate you
coming down.
I am so embarrassed.
Please, you've got to stop.
I want you to take this
up to Miami for me, okay?
I want you to give it
to a detective Gissen.
Gissen?
Gissen, right.
I'm going to give you
his phone number.
Tell him
I need prints on that asap.
Is it for this thing?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Who?
Thank you.
Yeah.
Chief Whitlock.
Busy.
I understand you guys are holding
the evidence in the Scarcetti case.
Uh-huh.
I'm going to send a couple
agents this afternoon
If we can tie the serial numbers
to the bills you guys have,
we can tie Estaban to Scarcetti.
Why don't I call you tomorrow,
and we figure out a time--
The evidence has to stay
in my possession
until the appeals
process is over.
I didn't call you to get a lecture
on the rules of evidence.
We, i.e..,
the United States government,
need to check
the serial numbers on that cash.
Oh, yeah, and, chief...
Yeah?
It's been ten seconds.
Chief, you okay?
Yeah, yeah. Fine.
Just tell Gissen that I need
those prints really quick.
I'm sure Alex can--
we don't want
to give them to Alex.
Sorry. I just thought--
just do it!
All right. Okay.
I'm sorry.
I'm very sorry.
Just--just go there,
stay there,
and call me as soon
as they're done.
You got it.
ALEX: No, I've been on hold.
When should I call back?
Okay. Thanks.
MAN:
Here you go.
Basté, my phone records!
How long can it take to fax over
a few sheets of paper?
I'll call them again.
Alex, I think
we've got something here.
ALEX:
What?
Look at this entry into the
checkbook, that last one.
Is this the only
entry you found?
So far,
but it's a new register.
What's going on?
Hey. Looks like they got
a life insurance policy,
and we've got
a potential murder.
There's got to be tons of these
life insurance companies, right?
Right.
You got any pull at the bank?
Sure.
You want me to get an address?
Please.
MAN: Hey, Sharlene, you know
that report I gave you?
They're not going to
be able to run them
for another half an hour.
Shit.
You should see the rack
Just call me, T.
Those my phone records?
No, just a fax for me.
Basté, what's up with my fax?
It's not here.
She said she sent them.
Who's "she"?
Miss white.
Who's Miss white?
She's a supervisor over there.
I've dealt with her before.
Call Miss white back,
'cause they're not here.
I talked to her
a couple of minutes ago.
Detective...
Well, she assured me
that she sent them.
We need to call her back
and actually have her wait
as we see the fax
coming through.
Sure, boss. Be happy to.
Miss white?
This is detective Basté
with Miami-Dade.
Yeah, I just spoke to you about
the Harrison phone records.
I haven't received them yet.
What do you mean
you sent them?
I'm staring at the fax machine,
and it's not there.
I'm going to stand
right in front of it,
and if I don't hear
the phone ring in 30 seconds,
I'm going to your superiors.
Do I need to be
more clear than that?
Can I use your computer?
Couple of minutes.
They just e-mailed me a bunch
of warrants I need to look up.
Chief--
I'm not raising
my voice!
You got writer's block.
No, just working
on my report.
On what?
On somebody jaywalking?
Yeah, someone was jaywalking
or urinating on the sidewalk
or throwing spitballs
at a crossing guard.
I know it's a small office,
but it's my office.
Phone records
coming in. Alex!
Is this it?
It says "receiving."
Oh, shit.
It's out of paper.
You're kidding me.
Oh, God.
Could we get
some paper, Sharlene?
Anybody got any paper?
Paper, folks!
Don't all move at once.
Anybody in Banyan Key
have any paper?
It's about 8 1/2 by 11 inches.
Little rectangle.
Here you go.
What do you do? "Start"?
Here it comes.
We've got a little problem
with this machine.
It's fine, fine.
Great. Thank you.
Let me just get over here.
I hate this thing.
Here.
There we go. "Start."
Hah! There we go.
I can't read this.
It's the toner.
Have her re-fax it.
It's okay.
I can read it. It's okay.
No, fax it again.
That says Barry Thomas.
A friend of Chris' from high school.
I know him.
That one is Will Blount.
You guys okay?
It's okay.
This one is Frank Rhodes.
Frank Rhodes.
No. All the boxes
go to Miami.
So the last call they made was
to American airlines at 8 P.M.
Hey. Got a surprise for you.
Both of them already dead
when somebody
turned them into s'mores.
What?
Both of them?
No sign of smoke
in their lungs.
Come on. If they'd been alive
when that place went up,
their lungs
would look like mine.
Alex, here are
the cell phone records.
Cell phone?
They're on a different database
than the land lines.
"Town of Banyan Key."
"12:34 A.M."
What time did grandma say
she saw that prowler?
BASTÉ:
After
What time's  over?
Like 12:00, 12:30?
Hello?
ALEX:
This might be our guy.
How many phone calls
do you get after midnight?
MATT:
Must be a bad connection.
ALEX: All right.
Come on, come on.
Yeah. Okay.
Let me see if I can find
the number for you.
I don't know who it is.
OPERATOR: The Nextel subscriber
you are trying to reach
No, I don't have it.
Whoever it is works
for the town of Banyan Key.
How do we find out
whose phone this is?
All right, I'll...
BASTÉ: Just ask.
Is there anybody
even in Banyan Key?
Yeah, I'll talk to you later.
Hey, Alex?
I'm sorry,
I was drifting off there.
What'd you say that number was?
CHAE:
You're sure it's not 1099?
Chae, 0199.
That's my cell phone number.
Yours?
Yeah.
Aren't you county?
I work part-time as a paramedic--
football games, school stuff.
And you called him
last night?
I don't know.
Did I...
Oh, Jesus, I did
call him last night.
I called him from the bar.
I wanted to see if he wanted
to have a couple of drinks.
You're friends with him?
I wouldn't say that.
He's, like,
my bottom-of-the-list guy
when you've got to have
somebody to drink with.
I would have mentioned it.
I totally forgot.
You should have told me this
at the scene, Chae.
I'm sorry. I don't remember
too much about last night.
I had a fight with Barbara.
I was in no good shape.
Check with the bartender.
I closed the place,
staggered home,
passed out next to my wife.
I didn't move until I got the
call to show up at the scene.
I need a statement.
I'll give you
a statement right now.
What's the matter with you?
You're like a love child
of Barney fife and Joe Friday.
All right, a statement.
What the hell was that about?
I was sleeping with her.
Jesus.
So you...
No, but it was all a plan,
them coming back here.
They set me up.
They planned the whole thing.
What plan?
What do you mean?
I gave her
the Scarcetti money.
God!
Would you have given it to me
if I slept with you?
Any trace of the money?
None.
I thought I had
trouble with women.
Maybe you should
just tell her.
Who, Alex?
Yeah. Tell Alex.
Are you out of your mind?
Look what they got on me.
Motive--Ann Merai names me
beneficiary on her insurance policy,
and I was having
an affair with her.
Opportunity--
an eyewitness saw me
outside their house
the night it blew up.
You want to hear some more?
Alibi.
Home, by myself.
That good? At least you changed
your cell phone number.
Even if Alex
wanted to believe me,
there's so much evidence
against me,
she'd have to turn me in.
You're right.
That'd kill any chance you had
of getting back together.
What?
She says, "let's call
the divorce off."
What are you talking about?
I'm looking at murder charges.
The gal's a peach. I don't
know what you were thinking.
Never mind. Forget it.
Can I do anything?
You don't think obstruction
of justice is enough?
I'm on a roll.
Chief Whitlock.
They matched the prints
on the pen.
The guy's name is Paul Cabot.
He's done time before.
They got his prints
from a criminal database.
You got an address?
All right, come on.
Hurry up.
You want a beer?
Nah, I'm okay.
Ho ho ho.
What tangled webs we weave...
What you got?
Your doctor
worked at the hospital,
but seems he was
in my line of work.
Son of a gun.
Let's get out of here.
Let me get the beer.
Chae, come on, let's go.
Come on. I've got
to get the beer.
A beer in the hand
is worth two in the fridge.
What are you doing?
Bottom of the ninth.
Down by a lot of runs.
I got about
ten grand in the bank.
Get you down to Costa Rica.
You can scout out boats for us.
You think I'm done?
Mmm...
I appreciate the offer,
but I'm not running.
No. The idea
was I drive you.
Yeah, you can drive me.
Drive me back to the station.
All right.
All right.
Got your insurance company
on the line.
MAN:
Any messages there for me?
Who's the beneficiary?
All right, thank you.
You've been really helpful.
So she changed it?
So what does that mean?
Is that in the mail or...
Waiting to be processed.
Can you connect me?
All right, so call back
in half an hour?
Thank you.
How you doing, Bill?
You got no idea.
Let me ask you a favor.
I've got
a credit-card statement,
capitol one
credit-card statement
on a Paul Cabot.
I need you to find out the
last place he used his card.
I got something for you.
Yeah.
Yeah. No problem.
I found this under the seat
of one of the Harrison's cars.
It's a bank card receipt
to a gas station
used by a guy named Paul Cabot.
ALEX: Nice.
Check the phone records.
Already on it.
Paul Cabot.
Anybody know or ever heard
of a Paul Cabot?
Come on, people, wake up.
Yes? No?
ALL:
No.
Paul Cabot?
Frank, call the bank,
see what they've got.
No records of any incoming or
outgoing calls to a Paul Cabot.
Check every restaurant,
gas station...
BILL:
Yeah, Bill?
If this guy took a piss
and paid for it, I want to know.
There's a hold on it now?
Costa Coral hotel.
Yeah. On Atlantic Avenue.
You're a lifesaver.
Chief Whitlock?
Yeah.
Agent white.
This is Agent Fetzer.
We're here to pick up
the Scarcetti money.
Agent Stark said to send
the money to his office.
My guy left five minutes ago.
He told you we'd pick it up.
He said send it to his office.
He told you to send
the money to the office?
He'll tell you.
He wants to talk to you.
Hello.
What the hell is your problem?
I told you to get that
money ready,
you said--
what are you, a parrot,
telling me what I said?
I know what I said.
No, I'm not a parrot.
I know what you said.
Then where the hell
is the money?
If you shut up
for five minutes,
I can tell you
where the money is.
I sent the money to your office.
My guy just left.
call your partners at the IRS,
tell them to audit me.
You little bastard!
What? What?
I meant five seconds.
Sorry, I can't hear you.
You're breaking up.
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?
Sorry about your phone.
Can you hear me now?
OPERATOR: Costa Coral hotel.
Good afternoon.
I just checked in
to your hotel.
I'm trying to access
my voice mail.
I'm on my cell phone.
Can you help me?
I don't remember.
I just checked in.
Paul Cabot.
Alex, we've got a Paul Cabot
at a Costa Coral hotel in Miami.
It's on Atlantic.
You're supposed to be here already.
Did you get those things?
Yeah. You got a TV?
Watch pay-per-view.
Forget pay-per-view.
You got your wife under control?
She's not talking to nobody.
She's not going nowhere.
She's got too much to lose.
Damn, man.
You take a terrible picture.
Right, right.
Excuse me.
How you doing?
I left my key up in my room.
A knucklehead.
Paul Cabot, 715.
Happens all the time,
Mr. Cabot.
Thank you.
Paul?
Paul Cabot, it's the police.
WOMAN:
MAN:
Oh, fuck...
DISPATCH:
There's somebody up there!
What?
There's somebody up there!
Oh, my God!
Where?
WOMAN ON TV: So you're breaking up
with me because I'm too...blonde?
See you, Mr. Cabot.
BASTÉ: Do you have a Paul Cabot
registered here?
CONCIERGE: Cabot?
Yeah.
Someone was just pushed off
the seventh-floor balcony!
ALEX:
How do you know he was pushed?
A man was seen climbing
back into his room.
Calm down, relax.
Which side of the building was it on?
That's the guy!
That's him! That's Cabot!
I'll take four.
You go upstairs.
Stop!
Jesus!
Mathias?
I pulled in right after you.
Did he come down?
Nobody came past me.
I'll meet you
in the lobby.
Okay.
In the lobby.
Get these people out of here.
I'm gonna shut down
the elevators.
It's him. It's him!
Police officer.
Upstairs, upstairs!
I'll cover the back!
CHAE:
Yeah, I got the money.
Right behind the seat.
I'm not flying to Costa Rica.
Get off the phone.
I gotta go.
Your new girl?
No.
Weren't we supposed
to meet in the lobby?
I just had to get my cell
out of the car, make a call...
...back to the office,
you know, checking on a lead.
Let's go back upstairs.
My boys are on it.
Okay.
Why don't we go have a talk?
Sure.
Okay.
ALEX: You got something
you, uh...Want to tell me
or need to tell me?
What do you mean?
I mean something
that I ought to know,
but that you might not
want to say.
Congratulations
on making detective.
I'm proud of you.
I never said it, but I am.
I know you are.
You don't have to say it.
That's not what
I'm talking about.
How'd you get
to the hotel so fast?
I heard it on the radio.
So nothing else
you want to say?
I'm gonna sign
those divorce papers.
I'm not talking--
I'll get to it.
I just haven't...
When we leave here, I'll sign 'em.
Mathias, it's cool.
We're in no hurry.
Are we?
I'm not.
You know what this place
reminds me of?
When we first started
going out.
Remember when we used to talk
on the phone for hours?
And you had this thing.
You'd say, "well,
I guess that's everything."
And you'd hang up on me.
And then you'd call right back.
That's right.
What would you say?
That I love you...
Very much.
I liked that.
Come here.
Come here, you have
something in your hair.
Chief. Chief.
These are from agent Stark.
He sounded kind of pissed.
See you tomorrow, okay?
MAN:
Detective, the hotel called.
The clerk's on his way
from the hospital.
Detective?
Call the insurance company,
see if they found out
who the beneficiary is yet.
Okay, you got it.
Hi. Accounting, please.
Of course they have.
Thank you.
Alex, did Cabot make any
phone calls from his hotel?
We're waiting on them.
Okay.
Chief, the hotel called.
They left a message.
The clerk left half an hour ago.
He should be here any minute.
Great.
Whitlock.
Hello?
ANN:
This is a surprise.
There's so much
I have to tell you.
I need to...
You got a lot of people
worried about you, Ann.
We all had the funny idea
that you were dead.
I'm sorry, Matt.
I'm so sorry.
Where's Chris?
He forced me to do this.
He and his friend Paul found
out about the Scarcetti thing.
You switched
the dental records.
He was?
to collect on
the insurance policy.
So what do you want me to do?
So where's Chris?
You're right.
I should have come to you earlier.
He's there, isn't he?
Yes.
Uh-huh.
Matt?
I have the money.
Oh, Matt.
No, I don't want to involve you
in any more of this.
Where are you?
Stay there.
I'll meet you.
MAN:
I've interviewed her twice already,
and it does match up.
Neil, detective
Diaz-Whitlock.
Hi.
Ouch. How you feeling?
I'm okay.
You're up for answering
a few questions? Yeah?
You need anything else?
This way.
All right, Neil,
take a seat to your left.
Here you go.
Where's chief Whitlock?
I don't know. Bathroom, maybe.
Alex, insurance
company, line two.
Detective Diaz-Whitlock.
Thank you.
Matt. Matt.
Agent Stark, DEA.
I'm looking for chief Whitlock.
How much was it?
Did he arrange to have it
picked up or dropped off?
He told my agents he was
sending it to my office.
Nobody showed.
I'm sure there was just
a miscommunication.
That's a .38, Chris.
Only six shots.
Give me the gun.
Give me the gun!
He's gone.
You all right?
Give me the gun.
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.
Ann...
You said he beat you up.
It was self-defense.
No jury would convict you.
Just put the gun down.
You think Chris
did this to my face?
I think you should
put your gun on the floor.
What?
Put it down, Matt.
I didn't think I could
do this, but I will.
You set this up.
Put your gun on the floor.
Are you sure?
Mm-hmm.
Don't do this, Ann.
Where's the money?
Come on. Jesus!
So you...
We--we didn't mean anything
to each other?
It's not important.
So that's not important now.
It was just all an act?
Where's the money?
Look me in the eye and tell me
you didn't mean any of it.
Some of it!
Don't try to confuse me!
I don't have any choice now.
You don't have to do this.
I've known you all your life.
I know you're not a criminal.
Matt, stop!
What?!
Okay. All right,
high-school sweetheart.
You think I'm playing?
I'm not playing, Matt.
Damn!
I was aiming for your arm.
Well, you missed!
Where is it?
Outside the door.
Show me!
All right, all right.
Just calm down. Just calm down, Ann.
Just wait.
Just wait.
Don't shoot me, okay?
I'm just gonna reach for it.
Show me!
Here it is.
Put it down.
Wait, don't shoot me.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I'm--I'm-- I'm the one
that got you the money.
I'm trying to
save your life.
It wasn't all an act, baby.
It wasn't.
I can't live broke.
Life ain't shit when you're broke.
Shit!
Wait, wait, Ann!
Ann, wait, no!
Ann!
Oh, my God.
Anyone else up here?
No.
Oh...
How'd you find me?
Are you hit?
No, I'm okay.
I'm all right.
It's Alex. Get me an ambulance
and a med examiner.
No, I'm fine.
I'm at the end
of Runyon Road on the dock.
Hurry.
Did you kill Paul Cabot?
No...
It was self-defense.
He was attacking me.
I was trying
to get the money back.
You were just gonna
hand the money back?
That's what I was trying to do, Alex.
Then what's that over there, Matt?
What do you got?
Chris and Ann Harrison's
bodies are upstairs.
The real ones.
They were both
working for Cabot.
Chief found out they were here
and took care of business,
right?
Right.
Let's move.
Good job.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Your guy never
showed up, Whitlock.
Agent Stark?
Yeah.
You know, I don't care
if you're injured or not,
I want that evidence money,
or you're gonna be looking
at a case of your own--
where the hell is Southeast
No.
I told you 53rd street,
not 63rd.
No, you did not.
Yes, I did.
I said Southeast 53rd--
you said,
"those assholes in the DEA
are at 8400
Southeast 63rd street."
I didn't.
I'm sorry, agent Stark.
What I said was,
"those assholes from the DEA
are at 8400
southeast 53rd," Chae.
Never mind.
Just give them the money.
Give them the money.
You don't have to count it.
It's all there.
Have a safe ride home.
Come on.
Assholes.
It is all there, right?
Most of it.
It's all there. Jesus.
That's a pretty good one.
Nice touch.
A little over the top.
Which part?
Your part.
My part? You're the one
that came in here screaming.
What happened to you, man?
Just never leave your wife.
That's what happened to me.
I'd take the bullet.
Be careful there.
It's a classic, okay?
That grille work
comes from France.
How you feeling?
Excuse us.
Yes, ma'am.
Did you love her?
No.
Why would you do this, then?
Because I'm...
Because I'm stupid.
Because...
I thought I was doing
the right thing,
trying to help her,
but it's no excuse.
Alex, sometimes people,
you know,
do stupid things.
Especially when
they're still in love.
Thank you.
Let's go.
Chae?
Hello.
Hi.
How you doing?
I thought you were Chae.
He called all worked up
about something.
Okay.
You, uh,
you want to sit down?
Yeah.
How you doing?
Good.
I ask that already?
Yes. I said I was good.
You want a beer?
Yes.
I don't have any left.
You can share mine, though.
So what brings you
out this way?
I just needed to move
the rest of my stuff.
Okay.
That's cool, I guess.
The house is a mess.
CHAE:
Say, Matt!
This came for you
at the station.
Hi, Chae.
You opened it? You opened my mail?
Yeah.
Why you always opening my mail?
Read it.
They just want you
to fill out the forms.
"To claim amount payable
to the beneficiary
for the sum of $1 million."
What?
We're rich.
The enclosed forms...
We're rich.
How about that?
$1 million.
Easy, Chae. Easy.
He can't take that money.
I can't take the money?
Why not?
It's a conflict of interest.
He's the legal beneficiary.
I am the legal beneficiary.
And he's one of
the arresting officers.
What the hell's that got to do
with anything? So what?
Tell him how much trouble
you can get in.
Matt, it's a million bucks!
It's the chance
of a lifetime! No!
No, Chae.
As his wife, I'm telling you
he's not taking that money.
As my wife?
As your wife.
Matt, come on.
Come on, don't fall for that.
What do you mean as my wife?
As your wife.
You said you came
to move your stuff.
I'm moving back in.
This is great. Congratulations.
It's kind of fortuitous.
You serious?
Yeah.
Are you gonna behave?
I'm actually afraid
to leave you by yourself.
You won the sweepstakes, man.
Matt, you can do this later.
It's a million bucks.
Let's not lose focus.
You know, a honeymoon fund,
a nursery wing for the...
Matt, this is the--the--
the golden pot
at the end of
the storm thing!
Matt?
Just sign it
before you go in, huh?
I'm not gonna let you
do this to yourself.
I'm gonna be sitting out here
when you're finished.
I can wait three minutes.
I'm a patient man.
I am a patient man.
Come on, Matt!
