TEACHER: Okay, guys,
you might remember last week
I gave that great lecture on
Elvis Presley and the 1950s,
but today
we have to change gears
and talk about something
that's a little bit deeper,
a little harder to get at,
which is the
civil rights movement,
or the black freedom struggle,
or what some
historians have called
the second reconstruction.
Which I really like
because it ties it to
the first reconstruction
after the Civil War
to show that
there is a continuum,
there is a constant
struggle on the part of
African Americans in the south
to claim their freedom,
their liberty.
And, without a doubt,
uh, World War II really
provides the fuel for this,
that when you go
overseas to fight Hitler,
you get shot at,
you see your friends killed,
you're going to come home
a different person.
You're going to come back
a radicalized individual
willing to risk
life and limb.
So the Double V Campaign
during the war
is quite interesting.
It stood for
victory at home
and victory abroad.
Defeat Hitler and fascism
and his racist policies,
but also defeat Jim Crow,
the racist south.
And they tried to do that,
but they needed some help,
and without question in one
of the most important...
I can feel...
I can feel the presence
of almighty God in this room.
WOMAN: Yes!
Oh!
The swagger is coming
all upon us, isn't it?
MAN: Amen!
Crazy Keith,
are you crazy for Jesus?
MAN: Amen!
Are you jacked up on Jesus?
I am. I am.
I'm feeling the
almighty Jesus
in this room.
Are you all hearing me?
Let's all rise.
Let's all rise
and get a good amen.
Amen?
ALL: Amen.
Amen.
ALL: Amen.
Praise God.
Amen, amen
Amen, amen, amen
Amen, amen
Amen, amen, amen
Amen, amen
Amen, amen, amen
Amen, amen
Amen, amen, amen
In closing,
we are going to
read one more verse.
I'm going to read from
It says,
"But when you are tempted,
He will also provide a way out
"so that you can endure it."
How cool is that?
WOMAN: That's right!
Dudes, how cool is that?
MAN: It's awesome.
He's going to give you
a way out.
PREACHER:You all feel me?
Can I get an amen?
ALL:Yes!
Amen!
Let's close with a prayer.
PREACHER:Dear heavenly
Father, thank you so much
for bringing me
in the presence of these
wonderful young Christians
to discuss and to talk
about temptation,
Are you going to Florida?
Yeah, I'm driving.
Who you going with?
Brit and Candy and Cotty.
Be careful.
Why?
Because those
girls are scary.
No.
Especially Brit and Candy.
Why do you all say that?
'Cause they're just so cold.
They got demon blood.
They're evil.
They give me
the freakin' chill bumps.
Yeah.
No, I've known them
since kindergarten.
They're sweet.
They don't seem right, though.
I hope you pray
down there in Florida.
Pray hard core.
Pray super hard core.
GIRL: So fucking high!
Hit that baby.
Good morning, sunshine.
Wakey, wakey.
Rise and shine, little bitch.
What do y'all want?
BOTH: We want your money.
Fuck off!
Mind your own
fucking business.
Get out!
Your roommate sucks.
Come on, Faith, wake up.
Wake up.
I'm up.
What time is it?
Doesn't matter.
We need your money.
Where's the money?
All right, really,
where's your money?
For what?
BOTH: You know what.
It's getting hot in here
So take off all your clothes
I am getting so hot
I wanna take my clothes off
It's getting hot in here
Oh, so hot!
I am getting so hot
I wanna take my clothes off
With a little bit of ah ah
and a little bit of ah ah
$325.
What, are you serious?
That's it?
We're not even
like half way to spring break.
CANDY: Fuck.
That won't even get us
one night's hotel room
down there.
I have another $20
in my purse.
Faith.
Faith.
Do you know how expensive
that place is?
FAITH: So tired of seeing the
same things every single day.
Everybody's miserable here
because everybody sees
the same things.
They wake up
in the same bed,
the same houses,
same depressing
street lights.
One gas station.
The grass,
it's not even green,
it's brown.
Everything is the same
and everyone is just sad.
I don't want to end up
like them. I really want
to get out of here.
This is more than just
spring break.
This is our chance to see
something different.
COTTY:Everybody else
already left.
BRIT:Yeah,
everyone's gone.
We're the only
ones still here.
We fucking suck.
COTTY:We're leaving,
you guys.
We're not
gonna be stuck here.
FAITH:We're not gonna be
the only ones here.
BRIT:Yeah, we've been
saving this money since
the beginning of the year.
COTTY:We'll figure out
a way to get more.
How are we gonna get
enough money?
I don't know.
All I know is
I'm not gonna
sit here another day.
I'm not going
to sit in the same
fucking classroom.
We're not gonna be miserable.
We're getting out of here.
What's up?
Um... Can we use your car?
No.
Why?
It's in the shop.
Why?
Um, do you know anyone
else's car we can use?
Shady!
Do you?
No.
Come on, Cotty.
Everyone's pretty much gone.
You know where
Professor Stevens
keeps his car, don't you?
The El Camino?
Yes.
I know where
he hides the keys.
Of course you do.
Fuck you.
Why? What are you up to?
Don't worry.
I know we can.
Just fucking pretend like
it's a video game.
Act like you're in
a movie or something.
We can do this.
You can't be scared of shit.
Fuck that.
Don't be scared of nothing.
Let's just get
that fucking cash
and go on spring break.
CANDY:Just pretend
it's a fucking video game.
Act like you're in
a movie or something.
BRIT:You can't be
scared of shit.
Don't be scared of anything.
BRIT:Let's just get
this fucking money and
go on spring break, y'all.
Fuck yeah!
Let's fucking do it.
Fuck yeah!
Move! Go! Go!
Look, oh, my gosh.
How much money is that?
Look at all this!
A lot.
Where did it all come from?
We robbed The Chicken Shack.
Shut up.
With squirt guns.
With squirt guns.
Are you serious?
We did it. We pulled it off,
we really fucking
pulled it off.
It was fucking awesome.
Spring break.
Take a hit.
Fuck yeah!
Seeing all this money
makes my pussy wet.
Smell this shit.
Smell this shit.
Makes my tits look bigger.
Spring break.
We're going on
fucking spring break.
Spring break.
FAITH:
Hi, Grandma.
I'm starting to think
this is the most spiritual
place I've ever been.
I think
we found ourselves here.
We finally got
to see some other
parts of the world.
We saw some
beautiful things here.
God, I can't believe
how many new friends we made.
Friends from
all over the place, I mean,
everyone was so sweet here.
It's way more than just
having a good time.
God, it was so nice
to get a break from reality
for a little while.
I'll always
remember this trip.
I want to go back again
next year with you.
Feels as if
the world is perfect.
Dude, are you ready?
We gonna go live!
Spring break,
what's happening?
Yo, yo, yo,
what up, St. Pete?
You all just got transported.
I don't know if you know
that, but we're in
a magic place, y'all!
You are!
I ain't even
from this planet.
I'm from a different planet.
I just transported y'all out
into fucking space, y'all!
Here's some poetry.
I was laying on
the beach, yo.
There's palm trees, y'all.
This is the room
of the world, y'all.
You can change your life.
You can change
who you are, y'all.
You just got hypnotized
and transported to
another realm, y'all.
And this lasts forever.
We're gonna change
the world, y'all!
This is poetry in motion.
Big booties
and money falling, y'all.
Bikinis and
big booties, y'all,
that's what life is about.
Spring break forever, y'all!
Let me hear you!
Spring break!
Y'all,
it's like paradise here.
I know, I love it.
I wish we could all buy
a house here together.
Oh, yes.
I don't ever wanna leave.
Uh, fuck school.
Just fuck it.
Stop.
Give her some more, boys.
Yeah, motherfuckers!
Oil change.
Check it out!
FAITH: You know what
would be really cool?
If we could freeze life.
Like, if we could just
click it
and freeze it and say,
"This is the way
it's going to be forever."
Like having this moment
together forever.
That'd be real cool, Faith.
Really cool.
I'm not drunk enough
for that.
"Really cool, really cool."
"I'm so cool, y'all."
Are y'all making fun of me?
No, we just
want to click things
and freeze them.
And freeze them.
And buy houses together
and go to church services.
And pray.
I'm serious, y'all.
It's different here.
Here we go.
Here we go, baby.
Doing a good job!
That's what I'm talking about!
Oh! Take it like a stripper.
Goddamn, you look sexy.
I want that pussy, baby.
You're never gonna
get this pussy.
Never gonna
get this pussy
You're never gonna
get this pussy
FAITH:
Hi, Grandma.
The people here
are so much fun.
I want to come back again
next year with you.
That'd be cool.
No, I miss you, too.
I know, Mom, I'm sorry,
I should've told you
that I came.
You'd never let me go.
I should've told you.
I just wanted to go.
Well, we had
enough money, so...
We're fine,
we're... We're...
We got scooters.
We're just driving around.
We're meeting people
and I'm having fun.
I'm fine.
Fuck you, bitch.
I'm gonna fuck
your pussy tonight.
No, you're not.
You know why?
Why?
Because you're a little bitch.
I will, okay.
Bye.
I never want to go home.
Never want to go back.
Me either.
Same.
I finally feel like
I can be who I was
supposed to be here.
I know you did
a really bad thing,
but I'm really glad
you did it.
I feel better here.
Eighteen packs for $10.
That's cheap as hell.
That shit's cheap as hell!
That guy we got
stuck talking to...
He was so weird.
Next time, with those people
we don't like,
we'll talk deaf.
We'll pretend
like we're deaf.
We'll pretend that we're deaf
and then they'll go, ooh.
That is so mean.
"You want to fuck me?"
Let me find my pitch.
Open your mouth, bitch.
Open your mouth, bitch.
I was in the car.
I was sitting there,
looking out for all the
motherfucking police.
We were in the back,
we just opened the door
and we go,
"Freeze, motherfuckers!
Hands in the
motherfucking air!"
"Get your motherfucking knees
on the motherfucking ground,
you piece of shit!"
"Down, motherfuckers!
Down, motherfuckers, down!"
Get on your
fucking knees. Faith,
get on your fucking knees.
"Get your
motherfucking knees
on the fucking ground!"
What did they do?
They fucking
got on the ground.
You wanna die tonight?
I don't think so!
Give me your wallet now!
Give me your fucking wallet!
I put my shit up
to this bitch,
and I was going,
"Yo, fucking get on
your goddamn knees
"before I shoot your
motherfucking face off."
"Give me your
motherfucking money,
I won't kill you."
Give me your
fucking wallet, now!
You fucking hear me?
You fucking hear me?
"You want to
fucking die tonight?
"You want to fucking die
tonight? Give me all your
goddamn money.
"Give it to me now!"
"Get on your fucking knees!"
Y'all said that?
Yeah, we said it.
Get on your knees.
Get on your
motherfucking knees, bitch!
You wanna die tonight?
No.
You fucking scared?
You like that,
you piece of shit?
Give us your money.
You like that,
you sick piece of shit?
Give us your money.
Don't kill me.
Give it to us.
Give us your motherfucking
money now, bitch.
Give me all your
motherfucking money, now!
You gotta learn, man.
It's amazing.
Stick with us.
It's the best way to live.
You'll have all this power
and all the money you want.
Faith.
Faith, it's okay.
This isn't
supposed to happen.
We were just having fun.
We didn't do anything wrong.
This is where we are
supposed to find ourselves.
This is where we were
supposed to find who we are.
It's not supposed to
end this way.
This is where we were
gonna be forever.
This can't be
the end of the dream.
Now let me guess.
Spring breakers?
You're not going
to be charged with
narcotics possession
because it wasn't found
on your actual person.
You will be
issued citations.
You're gonna
have to pay the fines
or you're gonna do
two more days in County.
FAITH:We're gonna be
in so much trouble.
This wasn't
supposed to happen.
But you are gonna be
issued citations.
You're gonna have to
pay the fine
or you can do
two more days in County.
We don't have any money.
Call mommy or daddy
or do the time.
Spring break is not
an invitation to do
drugs and commit crimes.
Thank you.
Have fun, girls.
Somebody loves y'all.
You're free to go.
You just made bail.
Really?
Yes.
Morning.
Who are you?
My name is Alien.
My real name is Al,
but truth be told,
I ain't from
this planet, y'all.
Alien?
That's what they call me.
COTTY: Why are you here?
I saw y'all in there.
You looked like nice people.
Thought maybe
I'd bail you out.
Everyone can use a little
bailing out once in a while.
Why?
Why not?
Come on, y'all,
why you acting suspicious?
Get in.
Where we going?
We can go wherever
you all want.
Cotty?
She's got the
right idea, come on.
I'll be your chauffeur.
You're gonna be
our chauffeur?
Yeah.
Y'all can play Beyonce.
You all ever been
arrested before?
No.
Never?
No.
Shoplifting,
shit like that?
Steal bras?
Tough bitches up in here.
Bunch of tough
fucking criminals up in here.
You went to a party
and you got crazy?
Did you get crazy?
Come on, spring break.
Did you get crazy?
Smoke some weed?
Cocaine?
A little cocaine.
Cocaine? Shit.
See some bitches
all up on each other.
Yeah.
Yeah, what did you
think about that?
You liked it? You all ever
do that to each other?
Best friends.
I know you're in college.
Experimenting.
The time to experiment.
You met the twins?
Now, you got to
watch out for these twins.
You know,
they do everything together.
They eat together,
sleep together,
and they share their women.
You know what
they are all about, do you?
Double penetration.
That's how they do it.
Ain't that right?
Calm down over there.
Don't worry,
I'll keep them on a leash.
How about
this one right here.
What's your name?
Faith.
Faith?
That's a pretty name.
Thank you.
That mean you got faith?
You believe in God?
Amen, amen
FAITH:Yes.
Amen, amen
You pray a lot?
You pray for your friends
over here?
They bad girls?
You been doing
a lot of praying on this
trip for your girlfriends?
I was just thinking,
maybe you did
all that praying,
and I'm the answer
to your prayers.
You was all in trouble
and here I am.
How old are you?
You look about 15.
But you're pretty.
You're all pretty.
You run out of money?
What did you spend it on,
weed and motels?
Scooters?
Am I right?
Spring break.
Don't worry.
I got plenty of money.
How much?
Shit, I'm fucking
made of money.
Don't worry.
You'll get plenty.
We do it right here
in St. Pete's.
We do it gangster.
Gangster.
What do you say?
You want to have some fun?
Faith, you want
to have some fun?
You got a wild side?
You know,
I live at the beach
all year round.
I'm from here.
My home.
Grew up here.
I was the only white boy
in my whole neighborhood.
My daddy cracked out.
My mother, you know,
same old sob story, whatever.
But I'm making
this shit work.
Only bad part
is spring break.
That's when
all the scum come.
What do you do?
What you mean?
Like for a job.
For a job?
Straight hustle.
I'm a hustler.
I'm also a rapper.
Making it work.
I play all up
and down the coast.
People know me.
I got this song,
I got this hook,
"Hangin' with them dope boys."
People sing it
right back at me.
Shit, I don't know
any of these people.
They are singing at me.
Swear to God,
it was humbling.
Like, "Shit,
people listening."
You can check it out
on YouTube.
I'm blowing up.
you know, I've done
about every illegal activity
under the sun.
I'm a fucking gangster
with a heart of gold.
I'm all about
making that money.
Always and forever.
Are you being serious?
What do you think?
You better run
like you're running
from the police.
ALIEN: Let the girls play.
Faith, come here.
Come here!
That one?
Yo, let Faith shoot.
I don't like it here.
It's too weird.
This is not what
we came here for.
We came here to have fun and
we came here to party and...
This is not what
it was supposed to be.
It's not fair to me
because this is not
what I signed up for,
I don't know these people.
And we were in jail.
And this guy that
I don't even know
checks us out of the jail
and says all this weird stuff
and brings us here
with these people
touching us and
talking to us,
and I don't know them.
And I don't feel comfortable
and I want to go home.
This is not what
I signed up for.
I don't like it here.
Please, just take me home.
MAN: Come on,
just come with me.
Come on, we gonna party.
Stop acting scared.
It's okay, Faith.
Faith, we are not
going to let anything
happen to you, all right.
It's okay.
You all right?
What's wrong?
I just...
I want to go home.
Why? You upset?
I don't like it here.
Why? What's wrong?
This isn't why
we came here.
Why'd you come here?
I don't like
where we're from,
so I thought
if we came here
that we could...
Be free or just have fun.
Okay,
ain't that what we're doing?
Ain't we having fun?
No.
What kind of fun
did you want to have?
Not going to jail.
Well, you're out of jail now.
I didn't get you in jail,
I got you out of jail.
So don't put that on me.
I don't know you.
All right. And?
I don't know
what you want with
me and my friends.
But you should
leave us alone.
ALIEN: What, I'm just
trying to be nice.
Let's go home.
Please come back with me.
Please come back
home with me.
Let's go home.
Please.
FAITH:I don't know you.
ALIEN:All right.
I'll tell you what.
I like you.
I like you.
I ain't going to do
nothing to hurt you.
Don't you see that?
If you want to go home,
you can go home.
But then you're just
going to be home.
You're going to be back
right where you started.
And you'll be
thinking, "Hmm.
"Maybe I missed
something out there."
You want to go?
Why?
Why you so upset?
Nothing's wrong.
Nothing's wrong.
I want to go home.
I know. You can.
Goddamn,
I like you so much.
Listen to me,
listen to me.
You're going to go,
but your friends
are going to stay.
Your friends are
going to stay with me.
And I want you to know
that I like you so much.
I really do.
And your friends
ain't gonna go with you.
And I'm going to be thinking
about you when I'm with
your friends, okay?
I can tell that
something really, really bad
is going to happen.
Please. I just
have a really, really
bad feeling about this.
I just want you guys to come
home with me. Please.
Don't leave us.
I love you.
I'm going.
I don't want
to miss my bus.
ALIEN: Y'all be careful
with that water.
Lots of sharks out there.
The water looks real pretty,
but the sharks are waiting.
Bunch of vicious
motherfuckers.
Just lurking.
Just lurking.
Lurking.
Goddamn!
I must be dreaming.
Like a fucking calendar.
These three girls
in front of me,
I can't believe what I see.
How can this be?
They're like mermaids
come up from the sea.
Close my eyes.
Every time I look,
they're like
old fashioned bitches
straight out of book.
These three girls
in front of me,
can't believe what I see.
ALIEN:You're making it
so easy for me.
I don't know what
I did to deserve this.
My lucky year.
My lucky life.
I must've done
something good.
Some little kids,
they want to grow to
be president.
Some kids
want to be a doctor.
I just wanted to be bad.
They kicked me out of school,
I thought that was great!
ALIEN:"Shit,
I don't have to
go to your school."
That was the best
thing in the world.
Some people,
they want to do
the right thing.
I like doing
the wrong thing.
Everyone's always
telling me, "Yo,
you gotta change."
I'm about
stacking change, y'all.
Stacking change.
That's it, money.
I'm about making money.
That's the dream, y'all.
Most of my brothers
and sisters, they dead.
It was all bad.
They got murdered.
I'm the last one standing.
It's in our blood,
y'all, and I love it.
This was my dream.
I made it come true.
This is the fucking
American dream, y'all.
This is my fucking dream,
y'all. All this shit.
Look at my shit.
I got shorts,
every fucking color.
I got designer T-shirts.
I got gold bullets,
motherfucking vampires.
I gotScarface on repeat.
Nice movie.
Scarface on repeat,
constant, y'all.
I got Escape.
I got Calvin Klein Escape.
Mix that shit up
with Calvin Klein B.
Smell nice. I smell nice.
Ain't a fucking bed,
that's a fucking art piece.
My fucking spaceship.
USS Enterprise on this shit.
I go to different planets
on this motherfucker.
Me and my fucking Franklins,
we take off.
Take it off.
Take it off.
Look at my shit!
Look at my shit.
I got my blue Kool-Aid.
Ooh, you got your Kool-Aid.
I got my fucking nunchucks.
I got shurikens.
I got different flavors.
I got them scythes.
I got scythes, I got blades.
Look at my shit.
This ain't nothing.
I got rooms of this shit.
I got my dark tanning oil.
Lay out by the pool,
put on my dark tanning oil.
Machine guns.
Look at this!
Look at this motherfucker
here! Look at this
motherfucker!
ALIEN:I'm a fuckin' army
up in this shit.
ALIEN:Let me tell you all
about that motherfucker.
Them dudes are
straight off the block,
no-joke murderers,
killers and base heads,
motherfucking
nightmares walking.
ARCHIE:You got
a lot of fucking nerve.
Why, am I in trouble?
You bring your ass
into my club.
I'm just here to have
a little fun.
Here to have some fun.
You must think this is when
we were kids, remember that?
Of course I remember,
you was my best friend.
Yeah, you took me to
the ocean that one time.
That's the only time
I've ever been.
Yeah,
I taught your ass
how to swim.
And I taught you
everything you know.
I ain't denying it.
Now you think
you're a boss,
got your own operation,
you slick
and I don't like that shit.
What you want me to do,
you want me to
stay in your shadow
for the rest of my life?
I want you to buy
a fucking surfboard
and go back in
the middle of the ocean
and disappear.
Go back and do
what white boys do,
like robbing spring breakers,
hide under the boardwalk
like when we was kids.
Sounds to me like
someone's getting greedy.
Sounds to me like
somebody's getting pissed.
You saying there ain't
enough to go around?
Fuck no. You know
I own these streets.
You can handle
all this on your own?
You think
you can handle it?
Archie, you made me.
Anything you can handle,
I can handle.
Just like I made you,
I'm gonna break you.
I guess
we'll see, Professor.
ALIEN:Missiles on
that motherfucker!
I don't give a fuck!
I don't give a fuck!
Tell Archie and them
niggas come up now.
Tell Archie and those
motherfuckers to come
fuck with me now.
I'll fucking blast
their fucking asses.
Man fucking down.
I'll fuck that shit up.
Look at my shit!
Look at my shit!
I'm a fucking nightmare!

Death Star up in this shit.
Dropping fucking planets.
I'll drop that
fucking black planet.
Drop a missile

Let me smell it.
Let me smell it.
Careful with that,

That's loaded.
That's better.
Careful.
Don't point it at me.
It's a nice fucking gun.
Don't point it at me.
Sit the fuck down.
Get down on your
motherfucking knees.
Get down on

Do you know who

You think that you can

Open your mouth.

You like that, don't you?
Oh yeah,

You're a nasty little fuck.
Yeah, you are.
Do you like that?
You like that in there?
We have everything
we need right here.
We don't need you, Alien.
What if we just
used you to come here?
And in five seconds
we just shoot you?
Blow your brains out.
And you're dead.
You're gone.
You're dead.
We have all your stuff.
What do you think, Brit,
should we kill him?
I don't know.
Oh, you want more?
Oh, yeah! Mmm-hmm!
Oh, yeah! Ahh!
You sick motherfucker!
Oh, yeah!
ALIEN: Ahh!
You're nasty.
I just sucked

Did you like it?
You loved it.
And you're going
to do it again.
Mmm-hmm.
I'll do that shit
every night.
You better.
You're my motherfucking
soul mates.
I swear to God,
I just fell in love
with y'all.
ALIEN:You girls are
different from the rest.
I knew y'all were special
from the moment I saw you.
It's in your eyes.
It's written on your faces.
I want us all
to fall in love.
Let's cause
some trouble now.
Play something.
What you all want to hear?
Maybe something sweet.
Something uplifting.
Something sweet
and uplifting, huh?
Yeah.
Play something inspiring.
Y'all want to see
my sensitive side.
Mmm-hmm.
Sure do.
Play something
fucking inspiring.
Ah.
This one's by the little known
pop singer by the name
of Miss Britney Spears.
One of the greatest
singers of all time,
and an angel if there ever
was one on this Earth.
Spring break, bitches!
Alien's bringing
too much heat down,
and I don't like it.
He's taking food out
of my baby's mouth,
and my baby's hungry.
My baby needs to eat.
My baby's starving
and we're going
to do something about it.
Come on.
Not bad. Not bad.
Not bad.
What,

Ho, ho, ho, merry spring
motherfucking break.
What's up, my nigga?
What's up, Alien?
The fuck are your
bitches looking at, huh?
Y'all want
to die tonight?
Y'all motherfucking
wanna die today?
I've been looking for you.
Where the fuck you been?
You been hiding?
Listen, these are
my streets, man.
These streets belong to me.
Not you, motherfucker.
I should kill
your stupid ass.
You need to know to get
that through your thick
fucking skull, man.
This would be a good night
to kill somebody, man.
I should probably shoot you
in your motherfucking face.
Merry Christmas! Brrr!
Oh.
I'm so sorry.
I should've never
let this happen to you.
You know I care about you.
And I ain't gonna
let him get away
with this.
Spring break's over.
I know you both
want to stay.
I'm gonna get him.
I don't want
you to go home.
Please.

ARCHIE: That feels good, babe.
That feels real good.
I like that.
I feel like I'm living
the American dream.
I never want
this shit to stop
Look at these titties
and look at that ass.
Come here, Puss.
Damn, baby.
Feel like you're
playing piano on my dick,
like you're playing Mozart.
Hey, Mom.
I'm good.
I've actually been
thinking a lot lately.
I just want to do better.
Better at school,
better at life.
I just feel different
for some reason.
I feel changed,
like I just want to be
a good girl now.
I want to be happy
and have fun.
Yeah, Mommy,
I think that's the
secret to life.
Being a good person.
I'm sorry I haven't
called in so long.
I know.
No, I know, I know.
I apologize. Yeah.
Look, we went
on spring break.
Yeah.
It was so much fun.
You have no idea, Mom.
We had such an amazing time.
It was a blast. Yeah.
I just wanted
to let you know
that I'm coming home,
back to school
and everything.
And I just...
I love you so much, Mom.
And I'm gonna do better now.
I'm going to be
the best I can be.
ARCHIE: That's it, baby.
Do it just like that.
Yeah, make it all sparkle.
Get it squeaky
clean for me.
CANDY OVER PHONE:Yeah, Mom,
it was really great.
I think we found
ourselves here.
We finally got
to see some other
parts of the world.
We saw some beautiful
things here.
Things we'll never forget.
We got to let loose.
God, I can't
believe how many
new friends we made.
Friends from
all over the place.
Everyone was
so sweet here.
So warm and friendly.
I know we
made friends that
will last us a lifetime.
We met people
who are just like us.
People just
the same as us.
Everyone was just trying
to find themselves.
It was way more than just
having a good time.
We're different people now.
We see things differently.
More colors, more love,
more understanding.
God, it was so nice
to get a break from
reality for a little while.
I know we have to go back
to school, but I'll always
remember this trip.
Something so amazing.
Magical.
Feels as if
the world is perfect,
like it's never gonna end.
And at night here,
we can see way
past the stars.
We can see
into the light.
It's just... Ah!
It's beautiful.
Spring break forever.
