Come on, Carl!
There's been a break-in.
I found her.
She was out here by the shed
and she was just
lying on the ground.
And I could tell she was dead
the second I saw her.
And, um, I just don't get it.
We're not used to things like this
happening in this neighborhood.
I just can't believe
there was anybody that--
- Hey, how you doin'?
- Hey.
So, do you know this girl?
- No. So sad.
- Anyone else been around here?
Oh, yeah, my uncle George--
he lives across the street--
he was here.
His wife Arlene called the police
and then my sister Bonnie
came over with the twins.
And there have been
a lot of people over here.
- A little regular family picnic, huh?
- People are curious.
I want you to stay here with
the officer. Don't go nowhere.
- Oh, okay.
- Ma'am, right this way.
- You wanna run that tape back 10 feet?
- Yes, sir.
How long do you think she's been
trampling on the crime scene?
Too long.
No obvious blood.
Lots of trauma.
Look at her knees.
Toes are scraped.
There's no drag marks.
No rigor.
It's probably under two hours.
It didn't happen here.
Wanna wait for Crime Scene
before you start dicking with the body?
It's gonna rain.
I'll go run tape
and try to keep
this thundering herd
off the rest of the evidence.
Hey, princess!
Go get me a tarp.
She's fuckin' sitting
on a pile of pissants.
Yeah.
What's that? Gray fiber?
Any of you clowns call Crime Scene?
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee;
blessed art thou
amongst women,
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus...
Brian.
...Pray for us sinners,
now and at the hour of our death.
Amen.
Hey!
Come here.
What's in the bag?
I knew you'd find me.
It's not a game, Anne.
What's in the bag?
Milk of magnesia.
I get stomachaches.
All right, get in.
You're on juvie probation.
You're supposed to be home.
My mom says don't come home
till the porch light's out.
- So you can talk to her.
- She still got all the boyfriends?
Ain't you the one
with all the boyfriends?
I got diamonds put on each finger.
Aren't they pretty?
That's real nice.
I'm pushing the damn thing!
Every time I go--
How you doin', Lucie?
I'm all right.
You and I both know she's on probation.
What's she doing out?
She don't come home from school.
So what you're telling me
is you want her to come home
right after school, right?
Yeah, of course.
- You hear that?
- Yeah, I heard it.
All right, I'm gonna be
coming by here from time to time,
make sure she's home, okay?
I can call you
when she doesn't show up.
You don't need to be wasting
your time on us, Officer Brian.
Come on, honey.
Supper's on.
Mike.
Just wait over here by the car.
Don't move.
You been warned, princess
Come on, ladies!
Let's go.
I told you.
Let's go home. Come on.
Hey! Come on, everyone.
Move.
You got a wife and two kids, boy.
Come on up here, guys.
Against the truck, please.
Come on, keep going.
Keep going.
What'd I do?
- What'd you just say?
- What'd I do?
So, were you waiting in line
for a blow job or giving them?
ID.
You, too, dipshit.
Now, why don't I call
personnel at the plant,
have you move on
down the road?
Nah.
I like it here.
What you doin', brother?
- Just taking out the garbage.
- Mm-hmm.
This one here--
that's Lucie's son.
Yeah, he's probably banging her, too.
Go on inside.
What, your daddy drop you
on your fuckin' head or something?
Get in.
If it gets bad around here,
you call me, okay?
Come on in the house now, baby.
You come on in the house now.
Come on.
You just made it worse
for that little girl.
Social work ain't gonna
save her, Brian.
This is Detective Heigh.
Hey, Brian, this is Pam.
Listen, hon, we got a girl
gone missing over here.
- How long missing?
- 26 hours and no leads.
It's a- a new...
light green Toyota,
Texas plate-- GHY.
The girl's name is Kirsten Laine.
You got your command post
up yet?
Yeah, real soon. I'm gonna
call this in to your duty officer
'cause, listen, hon, I could really use
your help around here.
Yeah, Pam, I can't do that.
How come?
We got a homicide of our own
over here.
Female, blonde, well-dressed?
Female, probably a street kid,
dark hair.
Oh, come on, now.
Why don't you leave the early work
to that ace detective partner of yours
and help me out?
After all, he is the best.
There ain't a woman in the world
who don't love how I do it, sugar.
Okay? So, now,
don't try phoning our chief,
trying to pull some strings
and all that other kind of horseshit.
Take me off speaker.
Pam.
Would you request your partner
not continue to be
the asshole he was
when I was married to him?
They're just going to
refuse you permission.
'Cause of last time.
I cannot go
into your jurisdiction again
Your captain's going
to call my captain,
and he's going to unload about
how many hours and money they spent
on me working
on other counties' cases.
Listen, Bri, this is looking
like a real stinker.
We just located the car.
Where?
It's in the fields.
All right, right now what you have
is a missing person.
If you find a body-
if you find a body,
you call me right away.
Thank you, hon.
See, my daddy always said,
"Sometimes you get;
sometimes you get got."
I'll let you suss out
what just happened to you.
Clark County Sheriff’s Office...
- This is the area where six bodies...
- Come on, boy.
- ...Since 1970 have been found.
- Easy.
Damn it.
Say it ain't so.
Ma'am, can I see some ID?
Can I see some ID, please?
Why, yes, Officer, of course.
By the way, you the one
selling tickets here?
'Cause I'd sure as hell
like to buy one.
Detective Stall. You think maybe
you could do me a little favor
and get every asshole
off my crime scene right now?
While you're at it, why don't you
go ahead and make a list
of everybody whose footprints,
fingerprints, tire prints,
and hoof prints I might find on top
of the real goddamn evidence?
- Back up!
- Eddie, come on.
- Get that fuckin' horse out of here.
- You heard her!
Where the hell is CSI?

- Hi, sweetie.
- Hi.
Okay day?
It was okay.
# How could I say good... #
You better slow down on that 40.
Shit.
The 5-0.
- What's up, B?
- Hey, how are you?
- How's everybody today?
- All right.
- Staying out of the heat?
- Tryin'.
- Lady Worm, how are you?
- What you got?
I got to show you guys something.
I need you to take a look
and let me know if you've seen
this little girl before.
Mm-hmm.
- He came right up here to the house.
- Sheila.
What happened to your hand, Sheila?
Doctor taking them out tomorrow.
Her sister's boyfriend's
pit bull got her.
I should have stayed out of the yard,
but they told me the dog
was locked up.
- I told you they didn't lock that gate.
- They told you.
Anyway, he came right up here
to the house asking about her.
Who's "he"?
- Levon.
- Sheila.
- Levon.
- See...
Did you know that they crossed
a pit bull with a shih tzu?
What the hell is a shih tzu?
What are you talking about?
One of them little Chinese dogs, man-
one of them little bitty dogs.
That must have hurt.
- It's called a bullshit.
- You--
Are you gonna ask her
if it's one of her girls or what?
Or you just gonna read 'em
a bedtime story?
That's all you about, is bullshit.
You all bullshit.
- Come on.
- That's all you about.
I'm gonna go see a man
about a man.
Check with CSI.
I'll meet you there.
All right, let's go back,
talk about this girl.
She's about 15 years old,
just a little crack ho from up north--
Dallas or somewhere.
We called her the Little Debbie
She stayed everywhere,
slept where she could,
- sometimes over at Reba's shelter.
- Really?
And them boys
ain't scared of nobody.
And the scary one
is the white dude.
Yo, which way be Edwards Street?
- Say, you want a ride?
- I'm good.
Come on, you sure look like
you could use a ride.
Don't be teasing me now, girl.
- Lunchtime.
- All right, you good now, boys.
How you doin"?
I'm Brian-
Texas City Police Department.
I know your daddy.
Don't look at her.
Look at me.
I'm extending my hand here.
You should shake it.
- I'm not from here.
- You got any ID?
You seen this girl,
Levon Chalmers?
She came to me,
said a guy was following her,
giving her the fix.
I even think I seen him once.
You know her name?
Not really.
- Not really?
- No.
Why don't you ask him
what he call her?
All right, Levon, I need you
to come down to the station
and talk to me and my partner,
look at some pictures.
I'll give you my card.
You get lost or you need a ride,
use that card
and you call me, okay?
Most definitely.
Most definitely.
I'll see you soon.
All right.
Of course, it's only been
a few weeks,
but he has been
a good employee, though.
No problems.
Every time some little bitch
gets her period,
y'all gotta drag my ass in here?
Bet that one right there
is on the rag.
Bring him in first.
Can we sit in?
Okay, but don't talk,
don't smile,
don't even blink
if he looks at you.
What are you doing for women
these days, Salter?
Don't look at him.
What are you doing for ladies?
I ain't been with a woman
since I got out.
You just lie to me?
Did you not meet my girlfriend,
Pamela Palm?
Tell me the truth.
Tell me the truth.
Got a hooker.
I give her money.
- Is that it?
- Yeah, I got a couple of 'em.
Jesus Christ.
I hope he don't need
medical attention.
You had to call my chief, huh?
Yeah, and I asked for Brian.
Where's Brian?
If Brian gets stuck in your case,
we'll never get him out.
So you get Prince Charming instead.
It's okay.
I feel the same way.
It's 48 hours.
Just make the best of it.

- Hey, Reba, how you doin'?
- Hey, Brian, how are you?
- Got something for you.
- Thank you.
I need you to take a look
at this for me.
All right.
Oh.
- What are you doing here?
- She's been hanging out here lately.
You know, the girls upstairs
knew her real well.
Come on, let me take y'all up.
Man on the floor!
Man on the floor!
Hey, guys.
I'm Brian-
Texas City Police Department.
This is my partner Mike.
Mind if I sit down?
What's your names?
- Imani.
- I'm Marie.
Marie?
- How long you been in here?
- Four months.
How old are you?
You have family in here-
a mother, aunt, something?
All right, I have to
show you guys a picture.
I need to know
if you know this girl.
You ever seen her before?
She was our friend.
You know her name?
- Debbie Mills.
- Debbie what?
- Debbie Mills.
- Debbie Mills.
We kept her ID for her.
Mike, you got that other picture?
You ever seen this guy around?
- Yeah.
- Was that her pimp?
Was that her pimp?
- Look, she had to eat.
- You ever seen him smack her?
She would come here to hide
from him and the white guy.
They followed her here
and they dragged her out of bed.
- What else?
- He kicked her. He punched her.
- Yeah?
- He always made her cry.
- What else did he do?
- Tried to take all her money.
That's why we hid her real ID
and her money for her.
You said "white guy."
What'd he look like?
Pointy chin.
Go on, then.
- Short blond hair.
- How short?
I don't know!
Just short blond hair
- Go on.
- Some tattoos. That's all I know.
- Were they on his arms?
- On his arm and his neck.
Okay.
Good.
Give me your IDs.
Thank you.
Don't look at me like that.
We're gonna need CPS down here
at Reba's shelter on North Main.
Texas City Police Department.
Please hold.
Hey, Levon.
Sorry we're late.
- Thank you, thank you.
- Well, okay.
You wanted to ask me
some questions- here I am.
All right, good.
And, yeah.
Interview with Levon Chalmers
by Detectives Heigh and Souder.
I'm glad you want
to cooperate, Levon.
You came in here on your own accord,
so you can leave whenever you want.
That's greatly appreciated.
Here's your rights sheet.
I'm sure you've seen that before.
Will you sign that for me, please?
- Thank you.
- This'll be easy.
All I really want to know
is how you get a 14-year-old girl
to become a prostitute.
She said she was 15, man.
So, you knew she was a minor.
Okay. Good.
And you ever beat her up?
Okay, did you ever hold her
against her will?
Did you ever make her suck a dick
in the front seat of a truck
and then you kind of pulled her out
and beat the living shit out of her?
Bri, Pam's on the phone.
- I told you only to talk to me.
- You said I could go.
- Wait a minute.
- You sit the fuck down, asshole!
Pimping out young girls.
You motherfucker!
I ought to rip that thing
off your chin
- and shove it up your fuckin' ass!
- Mike!
- Don't you look at me like that.
- Levon came in here for a reason.
You're gonna help us
clear some stuff up, right?
Oh, I'm sorry, Levon.
I'm sorry we're stopping you
from your day job as what--
a fuckin' rocket scientist?
Levon here has got a rep
on the streets.
He knows what's going on.
I'm gonna ask you
a couple questions, all right?
Why would a killer, after he murdered
somebody, cut into 'em?
I'd assume to send a message-
"Don't fuck with us."
- You're assuming to send a message?
- Yeah, I'm assuming.
Yeah, 'cause you're not
that kind of guy.
Nah, that's not me.
All right, what about this other guy
I keep hearing about
that you hang out with,
this white guy with the tattoos?
What's his name?
What's his name?
Rule.
Rule Valley.
His name is Rule Valley.
- Stay close, all right?
- You know where I'm at.
Oh, my God!
No, no!
No, no!
No, no, no!
No!
No! God!
No!
Hey, come here.
Help me.
A man-- a man in my house.
- Is he still there?
- No. No, he's- he's outside.
Is your address 3214 Collin Avenue?
Yes. And my baby-
Ma'am, put the baby down...
- Brian.
- ...and secure all doors and windows.
- Police are on the way.
- Okay.
Ma'am, do you hear me?
...under attack at this time.
Unknown male assailant.
Oh, no! Ah!
Ma'am? Ma'am, hang on.
- The police are on their way.
- Help me! Help me!
Okay, come on.
I'm making a quick path
through the main room and crossing.
- I may just head off in there.
- 10-4.
What have we got?
He's got to be nearby.
Check this out.
The bag over there
and the street clothes.
Okay, I'll go get K-9 unit.
Leave that bag.
heading northwest of your location.
- Rawls, Rawls!
- I got him!
- You okay?
- I can't breathe.
We need medical assistance...
I'm telling you,
I was right on that guy's tail.
It was like I got jumped
by two guys.
They find my gun?
No, not yet.
You ready?
You recognize any of this?
Ah. Sorry.
Don't touch.
Just point, okay?
Those are mine.
They were on my clothesline.
That's probably
how he chose you, okay?
He saw your clothes
on that line.
You remember anybody
hanging around your neighborhood,
around your house,
your street, at the mall?
No.
There were two of them.
Say what?
Someone was outside.
Is this your office?
Mm-hmm.
Who can we expect to catch in here?
- Mommy might have to go get Grandma.
- Why?
Well, Grandma and I are gonna
go catch that bad man.
- Why?
- Because the policemen
want to sit in their office
instead of being on the street
looking for the criminal.
Look, I know it's late.
We just need a full description
and a statement.
- That's it.
- See...
- Detective Souder, line 2.
- ...this is probably how he chose you.
Okay? He saw your clothing-
No! No!
- Come with me.
- Brian.
Okay.
Officer, you take them
into my office right now.
And get Jim Roson.
You call him at home if you have to.
Notify County.
No, please stop!
Please stop!
Can you hear that?
I didn't pray for this girl
while it was happening.
I listened to her die,
and it was--
it was like I forgot or something.
You ever wonder why we're here?
Why Texas City?
Well, I know why you're here.
What if I can't stop this one, either?
You ain't gonna like this.
No, please stop! Please stop!
Can you track specifically
where the call originated from?
Yeah, I'm trying, Brian,
but the guy that called you
and your partner last night-
Yeah?
He did it from an area
where we get almost no coverage-
all along those bayous
outside Texas City.
- The killing fields?
- Yeah.
You get a connection,
you walk 10 feet and it disappears,
no matter what we try to do.
We gotta bring in
outside construction contractors
'cause our local people
won't go in there.
Why not?
Even the Indians who got pushed
in there in the 19th century
turned to cannibalism.
It's-- it's-- I don't know.
It's infected or something.
All right, just keep trying, okay?
Just keep trying.
- I'm gonna do everything I can.
- Thanks, Jim.
I thought you went to hell
if you worked on Sunday.
I needed to get a newspaper.
What are you doing here?
When you go to church,
you don't pray for me, right?
No, I pray for you.
- Don't do it no more.
- Why not?
'Cause everyone you pray for
ends up fuckin' dead.
Oh, am I allowed
to say "fuck" in front of him?
Actually, that one's dead.
That's what I'm talking about.
Mike, what's up?
I need subscribers.
That's all the information.
- Today?
- Yes, please.
You brought her in
on a Sunday?
That's Pam's rich kid's
cell phone numbers.
Ls the new pope the one
that don't like fags?
What's going on
with the phone, Mike?
Okay.
'Cause you're from New York,
I will now try to educate you
about round here.
I got an idea- why don't you go home
and aggravate your dog?
I don't know if that Laine girl
is alive or dead.
If she is in the fields,
then she is as good as gone.
And it don't matter
her family,
money, newspaper people,
detectives,
or how much you want to pray...
half of her is probably
back in the food chain.
You have her picture?
This is Us-.
Texas City, Debbie Mills.
One dead girl,
one unsolved.
This is them-
Clark County, the fields.
It's not our jurisdiction.
- What?
- Hey, that's enough now.
I told you to stay out
when I got the company, baby.
Now, come on.
Come on.
You just get your stuff
and get out of here.
Now.
- Fuck you, Russell!
- Hey, what's going on?
I don't know.
One of Mama's boyfriends.
Oh, shit.
Where you going, ladybug?
# Ladybug, ladybug,
fly away home #
# The house is on fire
and the kids are all gone. #
Ladybug
- $5.50.
- All right.
Wait.
$7.25.
Thank you.
A pack of Reds in the box.
Dad!
Hey, guys.
Sean, this is Anne.
Anne, this is my kids.
This is Coryn.
That's Grandma over there.
- Where's your mom, guys?
- Inside.
Mom, Dad's home!
- Who's this?
- This is Anne.
Anne, this is my wife Gwen.
This is for you.
Well, thank you very much.
Come on.
Everybody come on in.
Pass the plates, Mom.
One more meatloaf coming up.
This is our Sunday tradition.
You got it, Mama?
For over 100 years,
ever since the war.
Not today, not today, not today.
- Here's some mashed potatoes.
- You take some of that.
That's right, hooves,
or it can chews the 'could.'
My question is, "What is the could?"
Everybody get this.
- What is the could?
- The could.
Hold on, I'll get the phone.
Hello?
Honey, it's Pam.
- It's okay. I'll take her home.
- Mommy.
You good?
I'll be right back, okay?
You doin' all right, son?
The boy found the body
when he was walking his dog.
I left a message for Mike
on his cell phone.
Yep, left about 15 messages.
- Haven't heard from him?
- I learned on our honeymoon,
never call Mike after 2:00
in the afternoon on a weekend.
This ain't good, Bri.
- Is it Kirsten Laine?
- Yeah, it is.
They took her hands.
Her dress is buttoned up wrong.
Somebody put that dress
back on her.
You see the cause of death?
Not yet.
We got to get her out of here.
I got something here.
Pam, I got a print.
Damn it.
Ugh!
Come on.
Pull her out.
God damn it!
Good. You got it?
You still got it?
Oh, God!
- No. Damn it! Damn it.
- God!
Here, here.
God damn.
Here.
Why don't you answer your phone
once in a while, Detective?
You got 30 cops,
you got feds,
a fuckin' helicopter, you got
my fuckin' partner part time!
What the hell else you want?
I pulled Levon's rap sheet.
You get a chance to read it?
Huh?
You got rape, kidnapping, assault.
You got two guys with priors.
It goes right to them.
Our beat is Texas City.
I don't want to be here.
You don't belong here.
What if this is the girl we heard?
She was down and bound
here in this place.
And somebody took the time
to pick up their cell phone
and dial a number.
You know whose fucking number
they dialed, Mike?
That was yours and mine.
We're in there the other night
and there's no women there
and it's just dudes,
and they're all from North Carolina.
How'd you know they all
from North Carolina?
Well, they know Sparta,
Winston-Salem, Boone.
So anyway, there's no women there.
So I said, "Let's play cricket."
Cricket?
Ain't no cricket in North Carolina.
Oh, yes, they is.
Cricket's a game they play
in England.
You gotta be rich or a fag to play it.
I'm talkin' crickets and darts, man.
Come on.
Then you should have said "darts."
You know what I mean, though--
you gotta cancel out the 20s;
you cancel out the 19s;
you cancel out the 18s.
So, anyway, we're waiting
on them whores, and Brett-
Don't say "whores"
in front of your little sister.
They don't come inside
till around 11:00,
after the last shift.
You know, it's none of your business
what I say in front of my little sister.
Hey. Hey!
Hey!
How about I choke
your fuckin' lights out? Huh?
You dumb little bastard.
Should I get out and get her?
Nah. She's just gonna run on you.
# Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
how I wonder where you are #
# Up above the world so high,
like a diamond in the sky #
# Twinkle, twinkle, little star... #
What does he want?
You're not back working the streets,
are you, Lady Worm?
I gave that up a long time ago,
Officer Cracker.
- So you're an upstanding citizen?
- Mm-hmm, that's right.
All right.
Then, uh...
you wouldn't mind
telling me about the white guy
with the green Pontiac.
- You got a warrant?
- Just open the damn door.
It's none of your
damn business what's in here
No plates on this.
White guy took them off,
then parked it here.
Uh-huh.
- And how long has it been here?
- Two days.
. Is he paving yo"?
- No.
- No?
- You stupid? I said no.
I ain't crazy.
I ain't asking him for no money.
'Cause I don't want to have to
run you in as an accessory.
Detective, you wouldn't
be talking to me that way
if we was in a white neighborhood.
Why do you say that?
It means I don't see you
living on my street after work.
And you damn sure ain't gonna
let me sleep where you live.
Go sit on the curb
and don't go nowhere.
- This all for the Laine girl?
- Yeah.
Where are we headed?
Poachers' bar, near the fields.
Don't touch that.
Let me get it.
Might be.
Need to thaw it out.
Missing a ring finger?
All right, here.
I'm gonna need gas and restaurant
receipts for the last four days.
Did I say something funny?
Come on, darling.
Why don't you introduce us
to the boys who found the hand?
I tried.
I'm Detective Heigh,
Texas City Police Department.
Which one of you found the hand?
Me.
What about you?
I wasn't there.
What's your name?
Frank.
All right, Frank.
I'm gonna need that ring back.
What ring?
I'm gonna need that ring back.
So, is this the gratitude we get
for giving you guys a hand?
Hey!
Stop it! Down!
Get the fuck down!
Get down!
Get the fuck down!
Bri, we're good.
Bri!
Enough!
Bri, stop.
Brian, enough!
Brian!
Enough!
Brian!
Where'd you find it?
I'm gonna get a map,
and you're gonna show me
goddamn exactly where it is.
- I ain't seen you in years, boy.
- Mm-hmm.
You're an important person now, huh?
You used to come over here
a lot with your daddy.
Oh, yeah, I remember
when he made me hang around
while-- while you and the rest
of the bums- remember?
You just drank
as much alcohol as y'all could
and then--
and then y'all would vomit
all over each other.
- Shit, you remember that night?
- Yeah.
First guy pukes, and then all the rest
go at the same time,
- all over that damn card game.
- Mm-hmm.
You got to drive 'em home, though.
You was, what?
Yeah, I was 11.
Next time you don't answer
my partner's questions,
I'm gonna take
your peace officer's license
and I'm gonna shove it
up your ass.
You say hi to Nancy for me.
- Will these do?
- Yeah.
So, Levon and Rule
stashed the car
in Lady Worm's garage.
There's blood spatters.
There's a potential murder weapon.
It's the works.
The DNA's a match for Debbie Mills.
The judge issued warrants.
We'll pick 'em up on site.
Yeah.
You know--
you know,
I wish I'd seen all this.
What were you thinking?
Huh? Were you thinking,
"I'm a big New York gorilla"?
- Thinking, "I'm a big tough guy..."
- Go away, Mike.
"...Getting all tough
on those small-town fish"?
Was I talking to you?
Go on.
You don't know how close
to the edge you are.
You belong with Levon and Rule
in Texas City with me.
You don't know
where you are right here.
This place- this place
is nothing but chaos.
Your God don't even come here.
You don't know
where you are right here.
I know exactly where I am.
See the red?
That's the first call to 911
from that woman Lila.
The assailant's
the background voice
Now, the blue--
that's the call that came in later
on your office phone.
See? They match.
All right, where'd the second call
come from?
- The fields.
- Yeah.
And he's using a cell-
someone else's.
A-- someone called...
Kirsten Laine.
He's using her cell.
He wants us to know
he can use her cell.
All right, how much coverage
can you get on this number?
I need your help.
I need you to get me up
on that girl's cell phone, okay?
She got caught trying to sell
a driver's license at school.
Had your card on her.
Can't you just go home and watch TV
like other kids? Can you do that?
- Yeah.
- Then get out of here. Go do it.
Look, what did I do? Huh?
What did I do?
You know you're never alone?
There's always someone
looking out for you.
Now, who's that, hmm? God?
Now, you see,
God's too busy for me.
I figured it out.
Everybody's always, you know,
busting his balls all the time-
you know, "Give me this.
I want that."
He ain't got time for little people.
Not me.
Is that what you think?
You all right?
Yeah.
Why don't you run in
and get some of that
milk of magnesia stuff?
Here, let me give you some money.
I'm gonna stay here
and make a phone call, okay?
- Yeah.
- I'll be waiting for you.
Jim, it's Brian.
Jim, no, I just want to know
when the line is up.
All right. Will you let me know
as soon as you are?
Pam, it's Brian.
You get any prints
off what we found?
All right. All right, bye.
Excuse me.
A little girl just came in here.
- Did you see her?
- I don't know.
- I heard some kids fighting.
- Anne?
Might be in the bathroom
in the back.
Anne?
- Your security cameras up?
- Haven't worked in weeks.
Anne?
Anne!
at a Jim's Convenience Store.
Will you send some cars?
Base to 7-IDA-07.
Go ahead, base.
We can't raise 06.
Just try Brian at his residence.
Tell him we're set up at the garage.
Yeah, we got a green Pontiac
doing the block here.
He's been by us three times already.
- All right, give me the plate.
- It's not our guy, 07.
It is Texas 89 Juliet Romeo 623.
They've left the area.
Is that thing decked out
with custom wheels and dent in the rear?
Well, they just changed the plates.
All units, our boys are gonna be
back in the hood.
They're back on the set.
just stand by for my signal.
Leave a message.
Mike?
I think they snatched Little Anne.
I need you and your dog out here.
I'm midway between
the Taylor crime scene
and the poachers' camp.
Damn it.
Base, I need you
to raise my partner.
Base to 7-IDA-06.
Base to 7-IDA-06.
Base to 7-IDA-07;
I want them to enter
the garage before we take them.
- Is that one of our two ladies?
- Yeah. It's the old one, I think.
She's heading east,
coming your way.
passing by your location
with a shopping bag right now.
Ahh!
- Ow, ow!
- Stay down.
It's okay.
Help's coming.
My legs! Look at my legs!
- Stay calm. Look at me.
Stay calm.
Sheila!
There-- that driver, that car!
suspect's vehicle has hostage.
I got a civilian with burns.
Come on, get here!
- Stay here. It's okay, I'm here.
- Help me. Help me.
Deal with her!
- Let me the fuck out!
Shut the fuck up, bitch. Shut up!
green Pontiac
Get off my ass!
Shit!
- What the fuck is this shit?
- I got this shit.
What the fuck? We got shit.
Get back in the fuckin' car, man.
What the fuck are you doing?
This is motherfuckin' bad.
Fuck.
Motherfucker.
Mike, listen, I think
they snatched Little Anne.
I need you and your dog out here.
I'm midway between
the Taylor crime scene
and the poachers' camp.
Hey!
I had her at a convenience store.
She didn't come back out.
I went in-
signs of a struggle
Phone company
says this is where
the phone call to us
originated from.
So, I come from the biggest
clusterfuck of my career
to come look at a map and mud.
The body was found
right over there.
This is where Pam
found the latest girl.
These are other body recovery sites.
This bayou
we're standing in right now
connects every single one
of those sites.
It's right here.
I'm in this shit, too.
Yeah, you be Big Billy Badass.
That don't make you hard.
You still be a bitch in my book.
That's not what I'm trying
to say, nigga.
Then what you saying?
You don't shoot no laws.
You gotta discriminate.
I do whatever the fuck I want.
I even do you like that,
you get in my way.
You'd pull a gun on me?
That's it- our friendship
just died right then.
Get your toy, nigger.
See, you hard, you pull that trigger.
Brian.
Brian, over here.
She's alive, she's alive.
I've got a pulse.
It's okay, it's okay.
We'll get you out of here.
- God damn it.
- Hang in there, hang in there.
- Go, go.
- All right.
Come on!
- There we go.
- Get her out of here.
Brian, don't do nothing stupid.
- Now, we got two fugitives.
- They kept her alive,
- 'cause they're coming back for her.
- No!
Get out of my way!
Damn it.
- What do I tell Gwen?
- She already knows.
Come on, Lee.
Alex!
Stay here with the ambulance.
I'm going up ahead.
- I want an update in 15.
- Yes, ma'am.
Where? Where am I going?
He's here.
Follow this bayou.
- All right.
- Okay?
That fucking idiot took our dog.
My dog.
My dog.
Put your hands above your head.
Get down on your knees.
I said get down
on your goddamn knees.
Ah! Ah!
Go! Go!
Go!
- Yeah?
- He's dead.
Who's dead? Who is this?
- He said he's dead.
- He said Brian's dead?
I think so.
You think so?
Task force 3 to all units,
prepare to copy.
Just received unknown caller,
said 06 dead.
Repeat, said 06 dead.
- No further information.
- It's Brian's phone.
Yeah, hello?
Brian, he just called your partner
He said somebody's dead.
Who is this?
Who am I talking to?
I'm Brian's partner.
Who the fuck are you?
How did you know I got a call?
If you don't give me
the right answer,
I'm gonna come fuckin' over there
and find you.
The guy's using
Kirsten Laine's cell phone.
You're up on the girl's cell phone?
Yes.
Where'd the call originate from?
It came from the tower
on the west side,
near the old bridge.
Okay.
Okay, you call me
if he uses it again. You hear?
He said the killer's using
the victim's cell phone.
Near that bridge.
Lucie's place.
Fuckin' knew it!
I knew it.
Take 'em.
Go.
- Check this out, right here.
- Wait. Shh.
This way!
Give me the girl's phone number.
It's, uh, 587...
- You seen your sister?
- No.
Give me that.
Who's this?
- Put Lucie on the phone.
- What?
Put Lucie on the phone.
You asshole.
- He's out there.
- What'd he say?
- Who?
- He wants to speak to her.
Why Ma?

Where are we going?
You want me to pack my bag?
Where's the keys?

- Where's the keys?
Rhino? Rhino,

Hello?
- Ask 'em what they did to Little Anne.
- What?
Ask 'em what they did
to your daughter.
Some- somebody said, "Ask them
what they did to your daughter."
I didn't do nothing. Rhino--
- He killed a goddamn cop.
- Well, I had to.
This- this guy said, "Ask them--"
- Who-- who-
- Ma.
He killed Little Anne.
Ma, she's gone.
What are you saying?
I'm sorry.
Little Anne--
she ain't coming back.
She-- that's my baby.
He said she made
the cops come around.
- That's my little baby!
- And he made me go with him,
- but he did all the killing.
- That's my little baby!
He made me, Ma!
Don't touch me!
That is my baby!
He made me.
Damn it. Ah!
No!
Do it.
We got him!
- Do you want to look?
- No.
Anne?
Anne?
You ready?
