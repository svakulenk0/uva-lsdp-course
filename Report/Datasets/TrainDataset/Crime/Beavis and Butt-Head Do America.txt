Uh huh huh huh...
This is cool. Uh huh huh...
Ow. Cut it out, butt-hole.
BUTT-HEAD: Whoa!
Aah!
Uh huh huh huh...
Uh, hey, baby. Uh huh.
I'm, like, pretty tall.
Uh huh huh...
Damn it, cut it out.
I'm trying to score.
Nah! Yah!
Look at you, you bung-holes.
Uh huh...
Hey, baby, how's it goin'?
- Hey!
- No way, Beavis. I saw her first.
Damn it. I'm gonna kick your ass.
Damn it, Beavis.
I saw her first. Get outta here.
Hey, Butt-head.
Butt-head! Wake up!
Uh... uh... Damn it, Beavis,
I was about to score.
But check it out. It's gone.
- Mm mm mm...
- Uh... What?
- The TV! Mm mm mm...
- Uh... Oh, yeah.
Uh huh huh... Well, where is it?
I don't know.
I just woke up and it was gone.
And look, the window's broken.
We'll get 100 bucks for this.
Heh heh heh.
- No...
- Hmm. Uh huh huh huh...
- Uhh...
- Oh, no...
- Ohh...
- Uhh...
Uh huh huh huh...
- Ohh...
- Uhh...
Uh huh huh... Uhh...
I think I just
figured something out, Beavis.
W-w-what? Mm mm, heh...
This sucks. Uh huh huh...
Yeah, it really sucks.
Heh heh heh...
This sucks more than anything
that has ever sucked before.
We must find this butt-hole
that took our TV.
Yeah. Yeah!
# ISAAC HAYES: A couple of mean guys
with fire in their eyes
# Known by the names of
# CHORUS: Beavis and Butt-head!
# ISAAC HAYES: Yeah
# They'll chew you up
and spit you out, beyond a doubt
# It pays not to mess with
# CHORUS: Beavis and Butt-head!
# ISAAC HAYES: You got it
# If you cross Beavis and Butt-head
# They will throw down
and blow your ass away
# Y'know what I'm sayin'?
# Beavis and Butt-head!
# Beavis and Butt-head
BUTT-HEAD: Huh huh huh...
# Ahh, yes
It's not in here.
What are we gonna do, Butt-head?
- What if we never find it?
- Settle down, Beavis.
Wait a minute. I don't wanna go
to school. We gotta find our TV.
Shut up, Beavis. I got an idea.
Uh huh huh huh...
Let's just wheel this thing
back to the house.
Uh huh... yeah.
Uh, hey, excuse me, boys.
What's going on here?
Someone stole our TV.
We're just gonna use this one.
Get outta the way.
I'm afraid that TV
belongs to the school, mm-kay?
This could be a really positive
experience for you guys.
There's a wonderful
and exciting world out there
when we discover that we
don't need TV to entertain us.
He said anus. Uh huh huh huh...
Entertain us... anus. Oh, yeah.
Have you guys
heard a word I've said?
Uh, yeah. Anus.
Yeah, yeah. Heh heh...
Yeah, I heard it, too.
Look, guys, just take the TV
back to the A/V room right now.
And try to be a little more open
to life experiences, mm-kay?
What a dork.
Get it over here...
Ow. No!
- Aah!
- That was cool.
- No, it wasn't.
- Uh... oh, yeah.
Uh, what's going on out here?
Oh, no!
Uh, that belongs to the school.
It's supposed to be in the A/V room.
- Wasn't our fault.
- Get back here!
Beavis and Butt-head,
you're both expelled!
Cool.
Whoa, check it out, Beavis.
I didn't know Anderson had a camper.
Yeah. Maybe it has a TV.
Oh, hello. Are you boys here
to look at the refrigerator?
Uhh, no.
We're here to look at the TV.
Tom didn't tell me
it was broken. Go on in.
- Cool.
- Heh heh heh.
Well, that ought to hold her.
You know, the most important thing
you can have on a camper
is a good butane regulator,
and this here's
the best one they make.
I hope we can fix that fridge.
Marcy, we've been plannin'
for this trip our whole lives...
- And we're gonna go...
- Da-da-da...
What in the hell is that?
Dah... dah... da-da-dah
Ah, must be them damn buzzard hawks.
Let's get something to drink.
Ahh.
Aah! This crap is warm.
Beavis, you butt-hole, you broke it.
Aah, no, no, damn it!
Hey, what the hell's goin' on here?
- They're here to fix the TV.
- What? The TV ain't broken.
Uh... yeah, it is.
Yeah. Heh... heh heh...
Hey, wait a minute.
You two look kind of familiar.
Ain't you them kids that have
been whackin' off in my tool shed?
Uh huh huh...
We still don't have a TV, Butt-head.
I know, Beavis.
And damn it,
I can't sleep without a TV.
BUTT-HEAD: Dumb-ass.
H-help. Help me.
No... no...
What's your problem, Beavis?
Uhh... I need TV.
I need TV now! Damn it!
Whoa. TV.
Yeah, yeah. TV. Heh heh.
TV! Yeah.
Unh... unh... damn it.
Uhh... no.
Damn it!
You sure these guys
can pull this off, Earl?
It's gotta look like an accident.
Ohh! Oh, yeah.
Ohh...
Uh huh huh...
Ohh...
Beavis and Butt-head,
y-you little bastards!
Can we watch your TV?
No! Y-you're expelled.
Now, get outta here!
Wait a minute. Damn it!
I need a TV now.
We're missing everything.
Yeah, hold on a minute.
That must be them now.
Yeah, I'll call you back. Come in!
Ahh...
TV. Yeah.
You're late.
Really? Did we miss Baywatch?
Earl said you guys were young,
but, jeez...
As long as you can get the job done.
What are your names?
Uh, Butt-head. Uh huh...
Oh, I mean, Beavis. Heh heh heh...
That's OK. I'd rather not know
your names, anyway. Mine's Muddy.
I'm gonna get right to the point.
I'll pay you ten grand plus
expenses, payable after you do her.
Uhh... do her?
That's right - do her.
I'm offering you $10,000
plus expenses to do my wife.
We got a deal?
Um, actually,
we just want to watch TV.
Shut up, Beavis.
Uhh... yeah, we'll do your wife.
N-no! I wanna watch TV.
Aah!
Damn it, Beavis, you butt-munch.
This guy wants us to score with
his wife, and he's gonna pay us.
We can buy a new TV.
Heh heh. Really? Heh heh. Cool.
Uhh, huh huh... we'll do it, sir.
Well, all right, then.
Let's get down to business.
Here she is, boys.
Her name's Dallas.
She ain't as sweet as she looks.
She stole everything from me.
Watch out. She'll do you
faster than you do her.
Whoa. Uh huh... cool.
Heh heh. Yeah.
She's in her room in Vegas.
I got you one next to hers.
Your flight leaves in an hour.
I'll drive you to the airport.
Holed up.
Uh huh huh...
Hole.
Can we watch some TV first?
No.
Now, listen to me.
This is real important.
My wife's got this leather satchel.
A black bag, this big.
I need it back, boys.
Sentimental value,
you know what I mean?
Any questions so far?
Uhh, does she have big hooters?
Heh heh. Yeah, she sure does.
Uh huh... this is gonna be cool.
Y-y-yeah. Boi-yoi-yoi-ing.
Heh heh heh...
You guys are funny.
Let's have a drink on it, huh?
Now, don't let me down.
We're gonna get paid to score.
Yeah. Then we're gonna
get a big-screen TV...
with 2 remotes.
Beavis, this is the greatest day
of our lives.
Yeah.
Here you are.
Hey, Beavis, she touched my butt.
Hello there.
Are you two headin' for Las Vegas?
Yeah. We're gonna score.
Oh. Well, I hope
to score big there myself.
I'm mostly gonna be doin' the slots.
Yeah, yeah. I'm hoping
to do some sluts, too.
Do they have lots of sluts in Vegas?
There's so many slots
you won't know where to begin.
Whoa. Hey, Butt-head,
this chick is pretty cool.
She says
there's tons of sluts in Vegas.
Cool. Uh huh...
It's so nice to meet young men
who are so well-mannered.
I'm gonna have money
and a big-screen TV,
and there's gonna be
sluts everywhere.
- It's gonna rule.
- Oh, that's nice.
CAPTAIN: 'Look to the front of
the cabin for safety instructions.'
ATTENDANT:
'To fasten your seat belt,
'insert the free end
into the coupling... '
"Insert." Uh huh huh...
Uhh... hmm.
Damn it!
Uhh...
Hi. Can I help you with that?
- There. All set.
- I love you. Uh huh...
Hey, cut it out.
I want HER to do it.
Uh huh... come to Butt-head.
CAPTAIN: 'Flight attendants,
prepare for take-off.'
Nn! Damn it.
Hey, wait a minute. What's going on?
Aah! We're gonna die!
Aah! We're all gonna die!
Come to Butt-heaaaah...
Uhh, could you, like,
do that thing with my belt again?
Yeah. This is her.
Oh, she looks lovely.
I'm probably going to make out
with her first before we, uh...
you know, heh heh, get down.
I'm sorry.
You have to speak up, son.
I have this ringin' in my ears.
My doctor says it could be related
to my heart palpitations.
Heh. Really? I poop too much.
Ooh.
Maybe you're lactose-intolerant.
No, no. I poop too much!
And then I get tired.
Tired? Oh, well,
I know all about tired, dear.
I have just the thing for ya.
Take a couple of these.
They perk me right up.
Thanks.
Tastes like crap. What else ya got?
Oh, go right ahead. Help yourself.
So, uhh, huh huh...
goin' to Las Vegas?
Yi-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai...
Hi. We're serving dinner now.
Our selections tonight are
chicken piccata or seafood gumbo.
- Piccata! Titicaca!
- Does the gumbo have corn?
I am Cornholio.
I need piccata for my bung-hole.
You'll have to wait.
Are you threatening me?
My bung-hole will not wait.
Heh heh. Bungholio.
Uhh, hey, I got a beer.
Want some? Uh huh...
I am Cornholio!
Aah! Aah!
Aah...
Get outta the cockpit!
- Uh huh. You said...
- Now!
PA: 'Welcome to Las Vegas.'
Uhh...
This is Las Vegas?
Yeah. I thought there'd be
casinos and lights and stuff.
This isn't very good.
Hey, Butt-head,
why is that guy holding a sign?
Uhh...
maybe he's blind.
Uh huh. Check this out.
Ahem. Excuse me. Heh heh.
You guys know
where I can find these guys?
Oh.
Uhh, Be-a... Be-ave?
Um, Buh... Boo...
Boot? Someone named Boot?
This says Beavis.
And Boot-head.
Uhh... that's Butt-head.
Don't you get it, Beavis?
These dudes
have the same name as us.
Whoa, really? We should party.
This way, sirs.
Where are those guys?
Where the hell is he?
You sure this is the right place?
You Muddy?
What are you, cops?
No. Earl sent us, you know,
to take care of your wife.
What? Take care...
What the hell are you talkin' about?
- Who were the other two clowns?
- Huh?
God damn it! She did it again!
I'm going to Vegas
to kill all three of them!
I noticed your TV was broken.
Wanna buy a new one?
Just leave it.
Worthless piece of crap.
Really, man. We gotta start
stealin' from rich people.

I'm sorry about that little
misunderstanding, gentlemen.
We didn't realise
you were registered guests.
If there's anything we can do to...
Mm! Damn it!
This thing is stuck.
Uh, sir, it's attached to the...
You dumb-ass. Let me try.
Uh huh huh.
Hey, check it out.
That guy's still standing there.
Ahem.
Uhh... could you, like,
not stand there and stuff?
- Some people are dumb.
- Yeah, really.
Uhh... check it out, Beavis.
I wonder where this goes.
Uhh... huh huh.
Whoa. I think I hear a chick.
Really? Cool! Neat!
Ow!
All right, who are you?
CIA, FBI, ATF?
Hey, Butt-head, it's her!
- Whoa!
- Yeah!
Uh... huh huh huh, hey, baby...
Are we, like, gonna do it?
You got 2 seconds.
Uhh... huh huh...
Is that gonna be enough time?
- Who sent you?
- Uh, this drunk dude.
He said he was gonna
pay us to do you.
Muddy... Son of a bitch.
Hold it. What's he paying you?
Uhh... 10, uhh...
I got a better deal. I'll double it.
I'll pay you 20
to go back and do him.
Uh, you want us to do a guy? No way.
I don't know, Butt-head.
That is a lot of money.
We could close our eyes and pretend
he's a chick... Aah!
DALLAS: Damn.
You two wait right there.
Uh... huh huh huh.
I'm ready for love.
Yeah! I don't believe this.
Hmm.
Yeah, Las Vegas.
Give me the number
for Dream America tours.
Right.
Uh huh huh. Uh huh huh.
Yeah. You got a bus leaving today?
Where's it going?
Washington DC.
Give me 2 tickets.
No way, Butt-head.
You're always first.
Damn it, Beavis,
we've never done this before.
Oh, uhh... huh huh...
Wanna... you know... Uh huh huh...
Do it? Heh heh.
Hey, we're finally gonna score!
Do it?
BEAVIS: Ow!
You guys wanna... score? Oh, ho ho.
BEAVIS: Damn it!
Ow! Cut it out!
You wait here.
- Bunghole!
- Damn it! Ow! Aah!
Aah!
Uh... huh huh huh.
- Aah!
- Uh... huh huh huh.
No!
Aah! Aah! Aah!
DALLAS: Ahem!
BEAVIS: Aah!
Don't wear yourselves out, boys.
Save some energy for me.
- Uh huh huh huh.
- Hm hm, heh heh.
This is it, Beavis.
We're finally gonna score.
Heh heh... Thank God.
Yeah. We're gonna do it, all right.
- Uh, huh... Uh, huh...
- Oh, yeah! Eh, heh...
DALLAS: Ahem!
Boys... boys...
Boys!
First, you have to do a little
job for me. Would you like to?
Here's what it is.
I want you to take the bus
to Washington. That's all.
And when you get there,
I'll be waiting.
You're gonna make
a whole lot of money,
and I'm gonna give you everything.
- Uh huh huh...
- Hm, heh heh...
Until then, keep your pants on.
Now, your bus is downstairs waiting,
so get going.
- Uh huh huh...
- Hm, heh heh...
Let's go!
On three!
This is gonna be cool.
Can't wait. Heh heh.
Ow.
Get outta there, Beavis.
I want the window.
Why don't ya take turns?
Look, Butt-head.
It's that slut from the plane.
Oh, why, it's you two.
How d'you do in Las Vegas?
Um, we didn't score yet.
Oh, well, I'm sorry to hear that.
Me, I took a beatin'!
Cool.
So that's why
I'm bussin' it across America.
I'm so glad you're here.
Jim, Jim!
I want you to meet two nice boys.
Uh... oh...
This is Travis and Bob.
What's your last name, dear?
Uhh, Head.
My first name's Butt. Uh huh huh.
Agent Flemming, ATF.
Are you gonna tell us where it is,
or shall Agent Hurly
give you another cavity search?
Is that a promise?
Look, Mrs Scum, we know who you are.
Tell her, Bork.
Dallas Grimes,
married to Muddy Grimes.
You run a mom-and-pop
arms smuggling ring.
- Mmm. You got my bad side.
- Three days ago,
you pulled a job at the Army
Research Facility in Hadley, Nevada,
where you stole the X-5 unit.
We know you had it when you checked
in, so tell us where it is?
You gonna charge me?
I didn't think so.
You wanna let me go, or wait
till I file a wrongful arrest?
We got nothing. We can only hold her
another couple of hours.
Damn it! Cut her loose.
Where's that damn unit?
BUTT-HEAD:
Uh huh huh huh. We're in Washington.
BEAVIS:
Yeah, yeah. We're gonna score now.
OLD LADY: Actually, son,
we're at the Hoover Dam.
BEAVIS:
Um, no, no. We're in Washington!
BUTT-HEAD: Yeah.
We're gonna score now!
Over 40,000 tons of concrete
were used to build the Hoover Dam.
From top to bottom,
the dam is 51 stories.
It has a maximum capacity
for generating...
- Wow. Really?
- 2.074 Megawatts of electricity,
but on average,
it generates about 25% of that.
BEAVIS: I'll be damned.
Does anybody know how much energy
it takes to power Vegas?
Um, yeah, I just have a question.
Is this a God dam?
Uh huh huh.
You know, God damn. You know?
GUIDE: If you'll follow me this way.
BUTT-HEAD: This is dumb.
Let's go find that chick.
Yeah. Enough of this crap.
Whoa. Check it out, Butt-head. TV!
Cool.
I gotta hit the head.
Can you get me some coffee?
All right.
Talk to me, Bork.
A witness saw two teenagers
leaving Dallas's room
shortly before we arrived.
Did he get a full cavity search?
Uh... the witness?
You can never be too careful, Bork.
I didn't think it was necessary.
We have a picture from the elevator.
Here. Have a look.
What the hell?
They look like a couple of kids,
Chief.
Don't you know
what kids are capable of?
Don't you read the papers?
What the...
Damn it!
All they have
is these shows about water.
Yeah, really.
They need some shows about fire.
- Uhh, what are you doing, Beavis?
- Something's wrong with my butt.
Your butt sucks.
Hey, how come there's no sound?
Uhh... I'll fix it.
Uhh...
Yeah, yeah! There you go.
Louder! Louder!
Uh, huh... Hmm... Huh huh...
Mas... ter... a...
Masturbation? Uh huh huh huh!
You know, I'll tell you what.
It doesn't get any better than this.
This here is God's country.
Unspoiled and...
Aaaaah!
Uhh...
I think I found the remote.
What the hell's going on?
I swear, that's all I know.
They got on a tour bus heading west.
Uhh! Please...
I'm gonna kill 'em!
That was boring.
Yeah, yeah. Just the same thing,
over and over again.
Uhh, wait a minute.
We can't leave Washington
till we find that chick.
Oh, we're a long way
from Washington, Bob.
This is the Hoover Dam.
Dam. I'll be damned. Heh heh.
You boys better show up.
- See that, Bork?
- I don't get it.
You got half the state after you.
How do you get away?
Cut the power!
Damn right.
We're dealing with pros here.
My opinion - terrorists. What's
the scoop on that stolen unit?
Well, sir, it's not good.
Roll the tape.
The X-5 unit is a new
top-secret biological weapon.
A man-made virus,
the deadliest known to man.
It could wipe out
five states in five days.
Here's what happened
when it was tested on army recruits.
Look at these guys, Chief.
This thing
is a veritable Doomsday device.
Jesus jumped-up Christ!
If it falls into the wrong hands...
It gets worse.
The unit wasn't finished.
It has a flaw - the casing.
If hit hard, it could open,
releasing the virus.
As of now, these are
the most dangerous men in America.
I want these faces in front of every
Fed and sheriff within 1,000 miles.
The orders are dead or alive.
Let's just pray
that nothing hits that unit.
Ow! Ow!
Cut it out!
Get outta the way.
I wanna sit by the window.
OK, people, next stop: Grand Canyon.
# AC/DC: Gone Shootin'

RANGER: There are over 200
active geysers in Yellowstone Park.
Old Faithful here
is one of the largest.
During an eruption, the water
can reach as high as 200 feet.
- So?
- Hm hm, heh heh.
Uh, the geyser
shoots out over 12,000 gallons
of water in a single eruption.
That's not that much.
Yeah, really. Let's get outta here.
If you'll just step over here,
the geyser is seconds away...
Ooh, it's incredible.
Oh, oh, yeah. That's amazing.
It's incredible.
That's amazing.
- Uh huh huh huh.
- Hm hm, heh heh.
- Uh huh huh huh.
- Hm hm, heh heh.
Can't wait forever.
Damn kids. No respect.
Don't appreciate anything.
Oh, my God!
Wait! Stop!
Darn it.
Get me the police.
- Uh huh.
- Hm, heh.
This is the coolest thing
I have ever seen.
We got 'em.
They're on a bus on Highway 89.
Ah... heh... yeah, that was great.
Yeah.
Uhh... is this the right bus?
Um... heh heh.
Uh huh huh huh.
Hey, Beavis,
we're on a bus with chicks.
Hey, baby.
- They're not on the bus.
- These people know something.
I want full cavity searches.
- Everyone. Go deep on 'em.
- Agent Hurly.
I tell you, Bork,
these guys are smart, damn smart.
They're probably
a hundred miles away by now.
Uh huh huh.
Butt-head, this book kicks ass.
There's a talking snake,
and a naked chick,
and then this dude
puts a leaf on his schlong.
Cool.
Uhh... uhh...
Ow!
- Uh huh huh.
- Hm, heh heh.
Check it out, Butt-head -
porta-potties.
Cool. I gotta take a dump.
- Uh huh huh huh.
- Hm hm, heh heh.
BUTT-HEAD: Uhh... where's the toilet?
Forgive me, Father. I've sinned.
I slept with a woman, and, uh...
BUTT-HEAD: Really?
Uh huh huh. Was she naked?
Well, yes, Father.
Please forgive me.
Cool! Uh huh huh.
Could you, like, see her boobs?
Uh huh huh huh.
Uh, I'm sorry. How many Hail Marys?
BEAVIS: A thousand! Heh...
And I want you to hit yourself!
Right now!
- Uh, now?
- Yeah... do it!
Yeah! Harder! Do it again!
Oww! Aah!
- Uh huh huh huh.
- Hm hm, heh heh.
Heh... hm hm.
RECORDING: 'Welcome
to the petrified forest,
'the world's largest site
of petrified wood.'
- Uh huh huh.
- Hm, heh heh.
"Wood." Uh huh huh!
RECORDING: 'You may wonder,
"how can wood get so hard?"'
- Uh huh huh.
- Hm, heh heh.
RECORDING: 'The wood became hard
over 2 million years ago.'
Uh huh huh huh.
Hm hm, heh heh.
- Uh huh huh.
- Heh heh.
- Uh huh huh huh.
- Hm hm, heh heh.
"Wood." Uh huh huh...
Hey, where'd those chicks go?
I think you scared them off.
This sucks. What are we doing here?
Uhh... I don't know.
Uhh,
do you know where Washington is?
Uh, yeah.
About 2,000 miles that way.
- Cool.
- Thanks.
Didn't see which way they went
or their vehicle.
I don't suppose
you tried to stop them.
The most dangerous guys in America?
No, thanks. I make $9 an hour.
National security is the
responsibility of every American.
- Bork...
- Cavity search?
- Deep and hard.
- Agent Hurly.
They're not getting away.
I want roadblocks - every road
out of here for 200 miles.
Um... this sucks.
It's all hot and stuff.
This desert is stupid.
They need to put
a drinking fountain out here.
Yeah, like,
a 7-Eleven or something. Heh.
Somethin' wrong, Officer?
We're looking for these fugitives.
Well, I'll be danged.
That's them kids that have
been whackin' in my camper.
- You saw them?
- Sure.
Boy, I never seen two kids
do so much damned whackin'.
Blue Den, this is post 9.
I have positive ID.
They're like two spider monkeys...
Step out of the vehicle, please.
Wait a minute. Me and the missus
are on our way to Washington...
Now!
Now, wait right there.
You're dealing with a veteran
of two foreign wars.
They're the ones been whackin'.
I find anything broken,
you and I'll tangle.
Masturbating in the man's camper.
We're dealing
with two sick individuals.
I want that camper torn apart,
full cavity searches all around.
Something tells me
he could be involved.
What in the... Wait just a minute!
Chief, 2 days ago,
Express Airways had a disturbance
by someone calling himself
"Cornholio".
Guess who matches the description?
Finally, a real break.
Get me the departure point.
We'll kick ass.
- Uh huh huh.
- Nuhn.
- Uh huh huh...
- Hm hm, heh.
Uhh...
Uhh huh... hey!
One of you bastards got a match?
Uhh, yeah. My butt and your...
uhh... butt. Uh huh huh.
Uh huh huh. Uh huh.
- Uh huh huh.
- Hm, heh heh.
- Hm hm, heh heh.
- Uh huh huh huh.
Here's a song that might help you
cope with those feelings, mm-kay?
It's called Lesbian Seagull.
# She flies so gracefully
# Over rocks, trees and sand
# Soaring over cliffs
# And gently floating down to land
# She proudly lifts her voice
# To sound the mating call
# And soon her mate responds
# By singing, "caw"
# "Caw, caw"
# Come with me
# Lesbian seagull
# Settle down and rest with me
# Fly high
# Lesbian seagull... #
Uh, that's him!
He's their teacher!
Uh, huh, yeah.
Uh, what's going on here?
I'll ask the questions.
Are these your students?
I assume you're a government agent.
I would think you would know
there is something in this country
called due process, mm-kay?
That's the talk I'd expect
from the guy who taught these two.
Take this scum away.
I believe I'm supposed
to be read my Miranda rights.
Now... Whaa!
I always knew they were no good.
Uh, I hate...
Shut up! You've been harbouring
two criminal masterminds.
Chief, you know that guy whose
camper they were whackin' off in?
Bork, you are a federal agent.
You represent
the United States Government.
Never end a sentence
with a preposition.
Oh. Uh...
You know that guy
in whose camper they...
I mean that guy off
in whose camper they were whacking?
That's better. Yes?
We've run a sample through
the criminal sperm bank
and found two possible
genetic matches for a father.
Former Mötley Crüe roadies
turned drifters.
- You were a roadie for Mötley Crüe?
- Yep. Uh huh huh huh.
Aha... fire.
Uh, here's another true story.
About 15 years ago,
we stopped in this toilet...
uhh, called Highland.
Really? That's where we're from.
Then you know
what I'm talking about.
Anyway, here's the story.
I scored with these two chicks.
True story.
Heh heh heh. Yeah. Me, too.
You scored with two chicks?
Yeah. They were sluts.
- Aah!
- Shut up, dumb-ass!
You didn't score.
I scored with both of 'em.
Uh, do you think these two sluts
still live in Highland?
That would be cool.
Hey, you want to see
something really cool?
Uh huh huh huh.
BEAVIS: Fire!
Ahh...
Uhh...
Hmm. Where'd those guys go? Yeah.
Um...
Are we almost there yet?
Uhh... probably, like,
another five minutes or something.
- The sun sucks.
- Yeah.
Cut it out, butt-hole!
Hey, Butt-head.
Isn't there supposed to be,
like, water in cactuses?
Uhh...
Hey, Beavis...
check it out.
- Uh huh huh.
- Heh heh heh.
Well, no, I can't say
that I've seen them, Officer.
- I hope it's safe to drive here.
- Stick to the main roads.
They're probably
hiding out in the desert.
Well, that's good to know, Officer.
Yeah.
Oh...
Hey, Butt-head, are we gonna die?
Uhh... uhh... probably.
Whoa!
I think my life is, like,
flashing in front of my eyes.
Whoa...
My life was cool.
Mm mm, oh, yeah...
Wait a minute.
I think I'm seeing something, too.
It's, like, a really long time ago.
Heh heh heh.
Yeah. This is gonna be cool.
Hey, how's it going?
Aah!
Mm mm, heh heh.
Yeah. I scored.
Hey, Butt-head,
I'm starting to feel weird.
I think I'm freaking out.
Uh... OK.
Whoa, this is cool.
It's like,
it's like everything looks
all weird...
There're all these weird shapes...
And it's sort of like...
it's like a music video.
What are you doing,
Butt-head? Stop it!
You're freaking me out! Cut it out!
What's going on?
# WHITE ZOMBIE: Ratfinks,
Suicide Tanks And Cannibal Girls
There's a problem here.
Ohh!
Oh, yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Fire! Fire! Fire!
Oh, yes!
- Aah!
- Aah! I'm all wet!
- Uhh...
- Oh, hey, cool.
Yeah. Water.
Oh, I'm gonna enjoy this.
Any last words before I kill you?
Uhh...
I have a couple.
Butt cheeks.
Yeah, yeah! And, um, and boobs.
I just wanna say that again. Boobs.
I'm gonna blow you both to hell!
Cool. Whoa.
Beavis, that's that dude
that's paying us to do his wife.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Um, can you just take us
to Washington?
We're gonna meet her there
and, you know...
Washington? That's where
she's gonna meet up with you?
You know, I just might
need you boys after all.
Get in the trunk. Both of you. Now!
BUTT-HEAD:
Boy, it sure is hard to score.
BEAVIS: Yeah, really.
Hey, hey, Butt-head,
check it out. Ajack.
- Uh huh huh.
- Heh heh heh.
# OZZY OSBOURNE: Walk on Water
# I met a magic man
# Who had a daughter
# She learned her lessons well
# But still I taught her...
BUTT-HEAD: Jack.
# As lambs to slaughter
# We shared forbidden fruit
# And things I brought her
# You may say I'm a miracle man... #
Hey, Beavis, check it out.
I'm jacking off.
- Uh huh huh.
- Heh heh heh.
Yeah.
- Uh huh huh.
- Heh heh heh.
Let's get out of here.
You go first, Beavis.
I don't know, Butt-head.
The road's moving pretty fast.
Come on, Beavis. Start running
really fast when you hit the ground.
- It'll work.
- No way. You go.
Don't be a wuss, Beavis.
Aah!
Uh huh huh.
That was cool.
Unh! Unh! Unh!
Boy, what I wouldn't give
for five minutes alone
with them two little bastards.
Aah!
MEDIC: I need a trauma box
over here right now!
The news here is not good.
Authorities call this the worst
highway disaster in history.
'Behind me, over 400 vehicles
lay wrecked or stuck.'
Chief, look!
'No one knows what caused it... '
Well, I'll be a blue-nosed gopher.
Where did these guys come from?
The question is
where are they going?
TV: 'ln other news,
G-PAC begins at 2 pm tomorrow,
'when representatives
from around the world... '
What the hell?
Bork! That bus we picked up,
where was it heading?
Uh, DC, Chief.
Jesus jumped-up...
Bork, can you imagine
what would happen
if they set that thing off
in the capital?
If they sold it to someone at that
conference? It's not gonna happen!
Whoa!
- This kicks ass.
- Yeah.
Yoo-hoo! Travis and Bob Head!
Hellooo!
- Butt-head, it's that chick.
- Uh, oh, yeah. Cool.
Maybe they'll take us to Washington,
and we can finally score.
Yeah.
Um, isn't Seattle in Washington?
Uh, yep. It sure is.
Cool. I was thinking after we score,
maybe we could go see Hole.
BUTT-HEAD: Hole.
Hmm.
MUDDY: Expecting somebody?
Well, well, look at this.
The love of my life.
Where have you been?
Honey, I was gonna split it
after I sold it.
Down the middle, I swear...
Now you don't have to
go to all that bother.
Come on, Muddy,
how about we just forget about it
and get a room like old times?
I don't think so. Where is it?
PA: All senators
are requested for a vote.
- Can I help you?
- Uh...
We're looking for Washington?
We're gonna meet this chick
with really big hooters.
Sirs, you are in Washington.
Really? Well, where is she?
Uh, could you make an announcement
that we're ready to score?
No.
Just a moment.
Hello? How may I help you?
BUTT-HEAD ON PA: 'Uh... attention.
'Attention. We're looking
for the chick with big boobs.'
BEAVIS: 'Yeah! Yeah! '
'We are ready to do you now.'
BOTH: 'Uh huh huh huh.'
SENATORS: Uh huh huh huh.
You forget
who you're dealing with, honey.
I got your mules
right here in my trunk, and...
Hey! Oh, damn! Damn!
I am gonna kill them!
No, honey...
We'regonna kill them.
DRIVER: Next stop, White House.
Hey! What's going on?
Why are we back on the bus?
It's time to go, son.
We can't leave!
We never met that chick! Damn it!
We were supposed to get some!
Settle down, Beavis.
No! I won't settle down!
Not this time!
Damn it! This always happens!
I think I'm gonna score,
then never score! It's not fair!
We travelled, um, um... 100 miles
'cause we thought we'd score!
It's not gonna happen! Damn it!
- Buddy, sit down!
- Shut up, asswipe!
I'm sick and tired of this!
We're never gonna score!
It's not gonna happen!
We'll get old like these people!
- But they've probably scored!
- Hey! Sit down!
It's, like, this chick's a slut!
And this guy's old,
but he's scored a million times!
Oh, yeah.
But not us! We're never gonna score!
We're never gonna score!
Right! That's it, numb-nuts!
Aah!
BEAVIS: Once more and I'll... Unh!
Kick your ass!
Well, look what we have here.
You two make me sick.
Book 'em, Bork.
You don't have anything on us.
Oh, I don't? How about lewd conduct?
Maybe indecent exposure.
Here's what's gonna happen.
One of you is gonna get me the unit.
The other gets 60 years in jail.
That's where you're wrong, boy.
We're back together,
and you'll never...
He stole the unit!
Said he put it in some kid's pants.
Why you damn little four-legged...
Hey! Take it easy!
I'm gonna rip your...
Now, Travis, it doesn't
do a body good to get all worked up.
Here, this should help you relax.
Does that say "Xanax"?
Um, yeah.
Probably. I don't know.
What else you got in there?
Gimme that thing!
Waah!
Our suspects are on a tour bus
heading for...
the White House?
Jumping Jesus!
I want everyone there!
Our people. Locals.
Orders are shoot to kill.
Ngaah!
Yeah, yeah, heh heh,
you know what's really cool?
Butt-head. Butt-head.
- Shut up, Beavis.
- Yeah. Ooh. Eeh.
Hey, Butt-head! Hey, Butt-head!
...l'll be your tour guide.
If you don't know,
today's a very special day.
Gathered at the White House today
for an historic
global conference called
"Give Peace A Chance" or "G-PAC"
are representatives
from around the world.
BEAVIS: Ngaaahh!
GUIDE: This is the East Room.
Many of these portraits
were saved from the fire
- set by the British in 1814...
- Fire! Fire!
What's your problem, Beavis?
Weeahh!
The site for the White House
was chosen by President Washington
and Pierre L'Enfant.
L'enfentata!
L'enfentata titicaca
for my bunghole!
- Bunghole!
- Sir?
Sir, are you OK?
Are you threatening me?
I am Cornholio!
OK... uh... sir,
maybe you should wait
out in the lobby?
Um, OK.
In this lobby, will there be TP?
For my bunghole?
- Cornholio... heh, heh.
- The room was originally...
Boy, where are you
when we need you, lke?
You know, honey,
even with all we've been through,
it don't change a thing.
I've said it before,
and I'll say it again.
This is the greatest country
on Earth, and...
Say, that looks kind of like...
naw, it couldn't be.
BEAVIS: Bungholio!
Are you threatening me?
I am Cornholio!
Yes, the President
does plan to speak today
at the G-PAC conference.
Mr Secretary! Mr Secretary!
What about the rumours that
a biological weapon has been stolen
and smuggled out of the country
during this conference?
Those rumours are
entirely unfounded.
Those rumours are totally unfounded.
I am the great Cornholio!
I am a gringo!
I have no bunghole.
Bungholio. Bungholio!
This is the State dining room,
where the most powerful
world leaders are entertained.
Hey! Uh, where's the TV?
There are no TVs
in the dining room.
This house sucks.
GUIDE: Please follow me.
Evacuation?
It's probably just another
bomb threat or something.
OK.
Is this the lobby?
I am Cornholio!
I need TP for my bunghole!
Yes, Mr President.
BEAVIS: 'I am Cornholio!
'My bunghole, it goes rattatataa... '
- Mr President?
-
Mr President,
I can't understand you.
Bwah! Bwah! Bwah! Ngaaah!
Sir, the President sounds strange.
I don't think it's a drill.
Washington may be under attack.
Go to DEFCON 4.
Step on it! Step on it! Move!
Uh huh huh huh...
Uh huh huh huh...
Uh huh huh...
Move it along, folks. Move it along.
Whoa! Hey, baby.
I noticed you have braces.
I have braces, too.
Whoa!
Uh huh huh huh. That was cool.
Whoa!
This is the coolest thing
I have ever seen.
- All right, where's the unit?
- Uhh...
My unit? Uh huh huh.
In my pants.
Uh... uh...
Not on him, Chief.
Agent Hurly, I want you to give
this scumbag a cavity search.
I'm talking roto-rooter.
Don't stop till you reach
the back of his teeth.
Yeah. Uh huh huh huh.
- Sir, we await your orders.
- Surrender your TP!
Give me that!
Mr President,
in the name of all that's holy,
I need those launch codes.
I am Cornholio!
You will cooperate with my bunghole.
For there is but one bunghole.
The almighty bunghole.
He's clean, Chief.
Uh... huh huh huh...
Did I just score?
The other guy has it.
He's got to be here somewhere.
"Cornholio?"
"Cornholio."
Bung-ho!
Est-ce que vouz savez
ce que c'est un "bung-hole?"
BEAVIS: Huh?
Fire. Bungholio.
Excuse me. I'm terribly sorry
for the inconvenience, gentlemen,
but we'll have to wait
outside for a moment.
Follow me, please?
"TP for my bunghole?"
Yeah! Yeah! TP for my bunghole.
AIDE: Let these conference gentlemen
through, please.
It's OK. He's with them.
You cannot run
from your own bunghole.
Bunghole, bunghole, bunghole.
Aha.
Uh heh heh heh. Oh, yeah.
Ohh.
# Mucha muchacha
Ahh.
# Mucha muchacha
Oh-ho-ho.
Boi-yoi-yoi-yoi-yoi-ing!
# Mucha muchacha,
Mucha muchacha #
Boy, it really makes you proud.
I could stay in here all day.
Sir,
I have to ask you to leave. Now!
That's enough. I been plannin'
this trip my whole life...
What do you think you're?
Something about a corn hole...
We haven't seen the Lincoln Room.
Let go of me!
Uh, say, Chief...
isn't that the guy whose camper
they were whackin'...
I mean,
off in whose whackin' camper...
Not now, Bork.
Honey, this country's going to hell
in a hand-basket.
I'm going to go and talk
to my congressman about this.
BEAVIS: Aah! Ooh. Mmm. Ah!
What the hell?
Wait here a minute.
BEAVIS: Oh! No! Ohh, no!
What in the hell is that damn noise?
I... Huh? Aah! What?!
BEAVIS: Hey. How's it going?
Pull your damn pants up, boy!
I don't want to see that!
Get out of here!
If I ever catch you
whackin' in here again,
I'll hog-tie you!
Aw, damn it!
Now I gotta straighten up in here.
We just cleared all four floors.
No sign of him.
Where the hell is he?
Say, Chief, isn't that the camper...
Bork, not now.
Chief, look.
Well, I'll be
a monkey's bare-assed uncle.
Attention, all units. We've got him.
He's on Pennsylvania Avenue.
I am Cornholio!
I will lay waste to your bunghole!
Bungholio. Holio-bungholio.
Hit the deck! Get down!
Bunghole, bunghole, bunghole...
OK, nobody shoot.
He could still have the unit on him.
Keep your distance.
We don't want to risk hitting it.
- Where are his pants?
- Who knows?
Bunghole.
- Bunghole? Bungholio.
- This is Agent Flemming, ATF.
We won't hurt you.
We just want the unit.
Tell us where it is.
Do you have TP?
TP for my bunghole?
We'll get you whatever you want.
We might need that other kid.
Do you have any holio?
Uh, yeah, this is Bork.
Listen, we need some TP.
And some...
what did he say?
Whoa. Uh huh huh huh.
This rules.
Can I have a gun, too?
You must bow down
to the almighty bunghole!
This is cool.
Garga-holio-ala-hole...
This is your last chance.
Give us the unit now.
Why does everybody
want to see my schlong?
Uh, bunghole.
- Mmm-bungholio-o-o-o-o.
- He's jerking us off.
We're gonna have to take him out.
Get ready to fire on my orders.
I am the one and only almighty
one and only bungholio!
FLEMMING: This is your last chance.
I'll give you three seconds.
BEAVIS: I have no bungholio!
Fire on the count of three. One...
Would you like to see my bunghole?
- I will show you my bungho-o-o-ole!
- Two...
I have no bungho-o-le!
Uh huh huh huh.
What's going on?
- What is this?
- Three!
Take your damn pants with you!
- Hold your fire!
- What in hell?
The pants! He's got the unit!
Drop the pants. Now!
Wait a minute. I ain't the one...
who...
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!
Uh huh. Uh huh huh.
Whoa. Oh.
Uh... here you go. Uh huh huh huh.
Wait just a minute, mister.
Sir, take a look at this.
How do you explain this?
What are you talking about?
So, using two innocent teenagers
as pawns in your sick game, huh?
I already told you
I don't know what this is about.
- Take him away.
- Hey! Get your damn hands off me!
God damn it! Hey!
Aah! Ow!
Damn it!
You don't know
who you're dealing with!
I'm a veteran of two foreign wars!
I ain't the one that...
I always thought
there was something wrong with him.
Yeah. Uh huh huh huh.
- He had a lot of problems.
- Yeah, yeah.
And he used to hit me.
Yeah. Uh heh heh.
Uh, hey...
does anyone wanna see MYunit?
I admit it. I figured you wrong.
I thought you were scum,
but you saved more lives
than you'll ever know.
You led us to one of the sickest
criminals in history.
This country owes you a debt.
Uh, does that mean we're gonna get,
like, money and stuff?
And, um, and chicks.
We were supposed to score.
For security reasons,
your actions will have
to remain top secret.
But someone very special
wants to give his thanks.
Beavis and Butt-head,
on behalf of your fellow Americans,
I extend my deepest thanks.
You exemplify a fine new crop
of young Americans,
who will grow into the leaders
of this great country.
Uh huh huh huh. He said "extend".
Oh, yeah.
In recognition
for your great service,
I'm appointing you honorary agents
in the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco & Firearms.
Whoa!
Alcohol and tobacco?
Yeah.
- And firearms! Yeah.
- Cool, huh?
Cigarettes and beer kick ass.
Yeah! Yeah!
We're in the Bureau
of beer and fire and cigarettes.
And maybe some chicks, too.
This is gonna be cool.
- Uh huh huh huh.
- Heh heh heh heh.
You know what sucks?
We never scored, or got any money.
Yeah. Really.
Um...
And my butt's still sore,
and that chick with the braces...
Butt-head. Butt-head, look!
- Yes!
- Yes!
Yes! Yes!
- Ohh. Ohh, yes.
- Uh huh huh.
Oh, yeah.
Hey, Butt-head.
Do you think we're ever gonna score?
Uh, I probably will.
But not you. Uh huh huh huh.
You're too much of a butt-monkey.
- Shut up, dill-hole. Mm heh heh.
- Butt-dumpling. Uh huh huh.
- Turd burglar. Mm heh heh.
- Uh, ass goblin. Uh huh huh.
Shut up, Butt-head.
Um, hey, doesn't Tom Anderson
live on this street?
- Uh, yeah.
- 'Cause, um...
I just need to stop by his tool shed
for a minute.
Heh heh heh.
You know what I'm saying?
Tool. Uh huh huh huh.
Boi-yoi-yoi-yoi-yoi-ing!
