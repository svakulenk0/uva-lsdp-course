Hey! Come on,
Mouse, out of the water!
Oh, Mama. A little longer.
- I said out! Right now!
You're both completely blue!
They're pretty.
- Who are they?
The Shah of Iran and his wife.
- Ah, my three Graces.
Papa, what is a Shah?
- Sort of like a king.
A Shah may cut off the
head of anyone he dislikes.
Don't tell the children such rubbish.
- The Truth is Simple.
With such power, there is no joke.
- Hallo, Klaus.
And? How goes the Revolution?
- Right now, it's on holiday.
Will you to come to our party tonight?
- Certainly.
Well, until then.
- Yes.
Ah, Klaus, not now.
Yeah, sure, OK.
- It makes me nervous.
Yes, but not very much.
So cheer up.
The royal couple landed at 11.05...
in a private plane
at Tempelhof airport.
Empress Farah wore a fox-fur coat
and a black and white hat.
Stefan!
Stefan!
The Shah inspected an
honour-guard of the Berlin Police.
Stefan, dear friend.
Fresh off the presses.
OK.
For all to hear.
My clever star-journalist wife...
wrote an open letter
to her imperial highness Farah Diba.
Don't make a big deal of it.
- It'll be in the next edition.
already at the universities.
Very good.
Good day, Mrs Pahlevi. There's a story
in the New Review about life in Iran,
about how hot it gets there,
and how you, like most Persians,
like to holiday on the Caspian coast.
Like most Persians?
Isn't that an exaggeration?
Most Persians are farmers,
and make less than 100 Marks a year.
And half of all Persian
mothers die giving birth.
From hunger, poverty and illness.
And the children work
Do most of them really holiday
with you at the Caspian seaside?
They write:
"The Shah must have a son. "
Iranian Law is
very strict on that point.
Strange that it seems so
unimportant to the Shah.
And no official statement is made.
That the Minister of Justice
makes no comment.
That unofficial courts
are held in secret.
That torture is allowed
under Persian law.
We do not want to insult you.
But the German public
should not be insulted
with crap like this
story in the New Review.
Faithfully,
Ulrike Meinhof.
Welcome, Pahlevi!
- Princess, Princess!
Farah! Farah Diba!
Murderer!
Are they crazy?
Murderer!
Are you crazy?
What are you doing?
Don't push me, you wanker!
Stop!
Is there a doctor here?
Let us through!
It's out of control here.
Are you stupid? There, the woman!
Can you help us?
We have an injured person here.
What happened?
He was attacking me.
- You are mad?
Let's go.
He needs a physician!
Mrs Meinhof, they were not on
the demonstrators' side. Why?
The right-wing press blamed
the disaster on the students.
Above all the Springer group
tried, in its newspaper,
to label the students as rioters.
"To shout is no longer enough,
now they want blood. "
But the truth is,
the protest proved that
we live in a Police state.
That the Police and the press
went too far in Berlin on June 2nd.
And that the only freedom
here is for the Police.
But Mrs Meinhof, with all respect...
- We all know that Kurras...
...who shot Ohnesorg, will be acquitted.
That is pure demagogy!
That is demagogy.
In America they discuss using
nuclear weapons in Vietnam,
and Israel starts a war of
aggression with the help of the USA.
which is called "preventive war" here.
- Israel has to defend itself.
Then Hitler's attacks on Poland
and Russia were also "preventive".
But you can't say that!
- Mrs Meinhof, I must say...
You must also consider the child.
This woman has nothing worthwhile to say.
The American Imperialist
machine will not stop!
Vietnam, Bolivia and now the Near East.
America has supplied
Israel with weapons for years.
Each warplane, each rocket,
each tank, everything comes from the USA.
Or the western industrial nations.
- They are not the people's friends!
The pigs want to control the
oil fields of the Near East.
It's just shit to them if
many thousands of people die.
I must now go to church.
- You should preach...
that over half the people in the world
do not have enough to eat.
Is it senseless to
preach for a better world?
That those condemned once again must resist!
You should get married soon.
Ulrike! Wait!
Wait!
Finally.
Hello, Baby.
- Well, Kitty?
So, here it is.
I hope it's enough.
Will it be enough?
- Why?
So...
- Hey!
I think... we don't want to
torch the department store
We need hard action to show
that wanker that we're not kidding!
And if people are still inside?
- Don't talk like a homo, Tussi.
Who'd be there at night?
And if there is: a bigger headline!
Are you insane?
- Andreas knows what he's doing.
You're under arrest!
- Police! Halt!
Idiot!
- Police!
Handcuff them!
- You're under arrest for arson.
Good morning.
Under continuous bombardment
by American warplanes...
of alleged Vietcong positions,
civilian populations suffer the most.
In the USA, particularly at
universities, these pictures led...
the students to rise up in protest.
In the Federal Republic...
thousands of students protest,
such as these, in Berlin.
The Anarchist Rudi Dutschke
mobilizes the resistance.
Comrades, we don't have much time.
In Vietnam the bombs fall every day.
We must stand up for them.
As Che said: It is not a matter of
wishing success to the victim of aggression,
but of sharing his fate.
One must accompany him
to his death or to victory.
From German ground...
From German ground
wars are still prepared.
From German ports and miltary bases...
The American military
wages the Vietnam war!
We cannot allow this!
We must stop the German government
helping this Imperialist war in Viet Nam!
Are you Ulrike Meinhof?
- Yes.
We are forced to take illegal action...
let sabotage and blockades start now!
We protest against this conference!
Ladies and Gentlemen,
this conference is terminated!
Are you Rudi Dutschke?
Yes, I am.
- You dirty communist pig!
I am dead. Let me live.
Father. Mother.
Soldier... Soldier...
He's down here!
He went down here somewhere.
Search the building site.
- Covering!
You are surrounded!
Come out with hands up!
I can't stand communists.
Rudi Dutschke is in critical condition
after two hours of emergency surgery today.
Only one of the two bullets
could be removed from his head.
Spontaneous demonstrations
have sprung up across the country,
blaming the Springer publishing house
for inciting the assasination attempt.
Springer, Murderer!
I didn't think this was your style!
Attention, this is the Police!
You are trespassing
on private property.
Leave the area immediately!
Come along!
Frau Meinhof? What are you doing here?
Release her. Frau Meinhof is a journalist.
Dresden!
Hiroshima!
Vietnam!
Dresden!
Hiroshima!
Vietnam!
Che Guevara was captured...
and then murdered by the CIA...
Yesterday Martin Luther King
was assasinated...
...Senator Robert Kennedy was shot...
Republican Richard Nixon becomes
the 37th President of the USA
Soldiers sealed off the street
and fired into the crowd.
One of the first Soviet vehicles
into Czechoslovakia...
The students call the protests
in Paris cultural revolution.
The state calls it anarchy.
The more I hear of this shouting,
the clearer it becomes - we need
to ensure the rule of law in this country.
In agreement with Andreas Baader
I want to make a statement.
He and I placed the bomb
in the department store.
We did it to protest
against the indifference...
of people who sit and watch
the genocide in Vietnam.
We believe that speech
without action is wrong.
Order, please!
Order, please!
Mr Mahler?
Could you do us the honour of
allowing the court to share the joke?
The judges can hardly understand
the ideas Ms Ensslins and Mr Baader.
Otherwise they would take off their
robes and join the protests themselves.
Order!
Order, please!
Mr Ensslin, your daughter wanted to
address your generation with her act.
Whatever they wanted to do,
it comes to this:
Our generation experienced,
in the name of the people,
concentration camps, Jew hate, genocide,
and now will not permit
reformation, a new beginning.
How do you explain that,
with the world as it is?
It's amazing that Gudrun, who considers
things very rationally and intelligently,
by one foolish act, experienced
a holy self implementation.
I feel that she created
something free with her act.
Even in the family.
I feel liberated.
Of a tightness and a fear,
that had ruled my life before.
It took the fear from me.
Throw a single stone,
and that is a crime.
Throw a thousand stones
and that is a political action.
Set fire to a car,
that is a crime.
Burn a thousand cars,
and that is a political act.
Protest is saying:
"I disagree with this and that. "
Thanks for making this possible.
- It's OK. I've read your work.
Can one stop the genocide in Vietnam by
burning down a department store?
No. It was an error,
as I said in court.
It was an act of rebellion.
But it was pointless...
while Fascism grows
as strong as it was under Hitler.
This time we offer resistance.
Out of responsibility before history.
People, here and in America,
must eat. Must eat and buy.
But they do not think
about it, they just consume.
We wanted them to
think about it a little.
So you burned down
a department store?
I will never resign myself
to doing nothing. Never.
If people try to murder us,
like Ohnesorg und Dutschke,
then we will shoot back.
That is only consistent.
Do you really mean that?
All over the world
comrades fight with guns in hand.
We must become soldiers.
- We fight already.
And if the fascists throw
you into prison for it?
Such victims they'll have.
Or do you believe that you'll change
something with your grand theory?
Sorry, I didn't mean to be cruel.
Is Baader or Gudrun here?
- Gudrun is up there.
Oh! Sorry!
- Hello. Who are you?
I'm Peter Boock.
- And I'm Gudrun.
Are you a runaway?
Youth Training Centre.
- There are others here, too.
They'll soon come and join us.
They gather up here.
Can I bathe afterwards?
- Bathe now.
No water wasting here.
Tell me about yourself.
Where did you get that?
- Youth Training Centre. Lucky City.
I heard about it.
You nearly burned the place down.
The bastards nearly
beat us to death for it.
If they catch me,
no more day leave till I turn 21.
Don't let it worry you.
You're part of our family now.
You were locked up for arson, too.
But we are free on appeal.
And at least we can make an appeal.
And so we make it.
- And if they find me?
Andreas and I must disappear,
if our appeal is rejected.
Tell me... do I see right?
You trying to fuck my old lady?
Well, Kitty?
Hey.
Andreas, this is Peter.
What happened to you?
- The staff at Lucky City.
Then we should tear them some new arseholes.
Great leather jacket!
Here, it's yours.
Let's go! To Darmstadt!
- We don't have enough cars.
Then we'll steal two or three.
Only the gun cures the rigidity.
Go on, fire at will!
Fire at will!
We have made
extraordinary efforts...
to understand what the people want.
We want more democracy.
These words of the new Federal Chancellor
Willy Brandt as he takes office...
reconcile the students and end
nearly 3 years continuous riots.
The reform promises to create
peace at the universities, and the basis
to bring the outside parliamentary
opposition into the democratic process.
And what do you believe?
- I think the worst is over.
The protest movement
has lost its momentum.
Groups which feel existentially oppressed
will not hesitate
to bomb whatever parts of
society they see as oppressive.
Over here!
Can't you see us?
Gudrun?
Andreas... Hallo, Astrid.
- Mister Counsellor.
And? What are your plans?
What's next for you?
Can't you talk normally? Do you
really think Interpol are after us?
...because those jerks
in Frankfurt rejected our appeal?
We're not going back to prison.
Then come to Berlin. Illegally.
We're building up a new group.
We're further along than you'd think.
What have your guys done?
A lot's happened since you've been away.
We have good contacts.
Houses, ID, money, weapons.
We can provide everything.
Yeah, under your leadership.
The illegal underground attorney.
I'm shitting myself.
- Let him finish.
They couldn't steal grandma's puppy!
- That's not the point.
Where's Dutschke now?
- Living in London.
He's crippled, can hardly speak.
Since he was shot, nobody leads
while the struggle goes on.
The struggle would have been won,
if they hadn't screwed it up.
Show us what you're made of.
Steal the purse from granny's bag.
Baby...
- I want to know if he's got the balls.
Or is it all just talk?
Oh, man!
Fucking shit, they're stealing my car!
Hey! Stop!
Fucking spagetti-muncher!
Shit! You dumb bitch,
you left the car open again!
So what? Steal a new one.
- You CUNT!
CUNT! FUCK IT ALL!
WHY?
What are you doing here? Why us?
So call the cops.
Where's Ulrike?
- In bed.
Where's the bedroom?
- Back there.
Wait a minute.
Quiet, you'll wake the children.
We're back.
They're hunting you, you know.
- Big deal.
Can we stay here for a while?
- Yes, of course.
We're recruiting here
in Berlin. And in other cities.
We're expanding the group.
Political conditions change.
What are your plans?
- What kind of stupid question is that?
We take action.
If it goes wrong, too bad.
So, that's it for me.
Where can I crash?
I'll join you in a moment.
What does he mean, though?
- He means exactly what he said.
Andreas does not compromise.
You must understand that.
Andreas is more of a revolutionary
than all the rest of us together.
Sounds great when you're stoned.
You look unhappy.
I saw a film about Youth Homes.
Girls there are treated like shit.
I thought I could do something
about it, but they remain shitty.
But Peggy there escaped.
What we need is a new morality.
You must see that clearly.
Draw a line between you and our enemies.
You must leave the system
and burn your bridges.
And your son?
That you may never see again?
If you're serious,
you have to be prepared to suffer.
Andreas also has a baby daughter.
I could never leave my children.
Shit.
Do you know how fast you were going?
- No. Do you?
Show me your license, please.
And the registration papers, please.
I'm sorry about this, officer.
My friend seems to have thrown them out.
You live in Rome, Mr Hoger?
- Yes.
Your date of birth?
- 14/6 nineteen...
'39.
You don't seem too sure about it.
- It was a long time ago.
And?
They're holding him in Moabit jail.
We have to get him out.
- I'll help.
Me too.
How? Tying sheets together?
You can write about it afterwards.
That's all you're good for.
Perhaps Andreas should
just serve the ten months.
Shit! Freeing Prisoners is
what we're always talking about.
We'll show the pigs what we can do,
if they lock up our people.
We're getting Andy out! Now!
We can't visit him in prison anyway.
You'll be a publisher.
We'll get in with a book contract.
Good day.
This is Dr Gretel Weitemeier,
who will be publishing our book.
Pleased to meet you.
- The pleasure's all mine.
Are you insane?
Man, it only fires tear gas.
Looks real though, eh?
Where did you get that?
- from Gudrun.
We've got a lot of things, now.
- And who is "we"?
I cannot say.
Well, I can:
Gudrun, Astrid, Ingrid.
I bought some Asprin.
- Ulrike.
She's only the decoy.
You told me you
wouldn't be involved!
What is your part? Well?
Mahler arranged for Andreas and I
to visit the Sociological Institute...
to research our book.
- They're allowing him out for that?
With a Police escort, of course.
- That's where we come in.
Inside the Institute,
we stick guns in the cops' faces...
and away runs Baader.
- And you?
I stand back and look surprised. That's all.
Now can we get on with dinner?
But you're all female.
What if they don't take you seriously?
Mahler knows some professionals.
We'll have help. Mahler says...
it'll be a piece of cake.
- I don't believe it.
The cops have real guns,
not like that piece of junk.
This is completely insane!
I have to go through with it.
Mr Baader, in the event of an
escape attempt, we are authorised to shoot.
I want to make sure you know that.
- You needn't worry about it.
I've seen you on TV.
- Hopefully I was interesting.
Yes, very. Anything else you need?
- Thanks, I'll manage.
Hey.
- Hey.
Sit down here.
Can I get a cup of coffee?
- Of course.
Are you married? Do you have any children?
- Yes, wife and child.
So, moving along. We have...
I told you yesterday,
come back after noon today.
The reading room is occupied.
- Then we'll wait here.
It's a long wait.
- We have time.
In the following discussion...
Go, quick. Let's move.
- What do you want here?
Shit!
Hands up!
- Up against the wall!
C'mon, Kitty!
Gudrun! Help me!
Stay down!
According to reports the kidnappers
shot the doorman with tear gas
They overpowered the guards
and released Baader by force of arms.
My God, the children!
Go, children, run.
Quickly.
We say: The uniform-wearer
is a pig, not a human.
And so we treat it as such.
We will not negotiate with them.
It is wrong to talk
at all with these people.
And of course, they may be shot
when we consider it necessary.
The gun makes its statement.
It is possible,
in our actions, our enemies
may occasionally triumph.
But where it is important,
they will not beat us.
Welcome to the camp!
- The attorney looks like Fidel Castro!
Welcome, Andreas. Hi, Gudrun.
- Which way to Havana?
This is Achmed, the Commander.
This is Gudrun and Andy.
The men sleep here, the women there!
- What?
The rules of the camp.
- Shit on that. We sleep together! There!
What's Ali Baba saying?
- Forget it. Come.
It's all fine. Sleep where you like.
All in this house here.
Fucking shit!
This does not have
anything to do with our job!
We are urban guerrillas, understand?
We don't fight in the desert!
Tell that camel-jockey we
fight against bank guards!
French.
What are they laughing about?
- We're just admiring your trousers.
You've got them a little dirty.
I'll finish you off, you cocksucker.
Baby, leave it.
he's one of us.
He is not one of us.
He's only here because he's
scared of the cops in Germany.
SICILY
You're homesick, right?
Which means you give up.
- These people are fighting a war...
What does our situation
in Germany have to do with it?
You can't force a revolution
there, even with a Kalashnikov.
Germany is just one front.
We fight with comrades everywhere
against injustice and oppression.
I thought you knew that.
- And what about your children?
You live underground.
Why bring them into it?
Sooner or later it'll come out that
I did not participate in the Baader escape.
Then I can go back legally.
I could take care of the children.
That sounds very much like betrayal.
Betrayal? Of whom?
Look after yourself.
What now? Can't we have a little fun?
He won't give us any more ammunition.
- Then we go on strike.
What are they staring at?
- Probably never seen naked women before.
Hey, look who's here.
What does one do with a traitor?
People's court.
What?
He asks us to get dressed.
- Why should we?
Sexual freedom and the fight
against imperialism go together.
He doesn't understand, Baby.
Fucking and shooting are the same!
Abu Hassan is commander
of the whole camp.
Don't worry...
...we'll bring you out.
Hands up!
Don't move!
Get down on the floor!
This is a hold-up!
Get away from the window!
Get down!
In West-Berlin today, a gang robbed
three different banks in 10 minutes.
In Breitenbach Platz, three
masked men and one woman.
At 8.10 AM four men dressed in parkas...
The robbers got away with
approximately 200,000 Marks.
It is believed that the robbers
are militant left-wing extremists.
Detectives found a bag of
ski-masks dumped by the bandits.
They left handbills with the text
"Expropriate from enemies of the people".
Not bad for 10 minutes work.
- Ulrike should write a statement.
Make clear that we only
took the money of capitalists.
That only the rich need be worried.
- Yeah, liberal wankers think that's good.
Stupid whore! Can't you
be careful? Shit-for-brains!
And so was the revolution made!
Some say,
Bank robbery is not political.
Revolutionaries in Latin America
call bank robbery "expropriation".
Official Statement
on Bank robbery.
It is politically
right to expropriate.
It is strategically right,
if it finances the revolution.
Your children are gone.
I just heard from Sicily.
The man who took them
even knew the code word.
They're surely already
with your ex, the old fascist.
The Baader-Meinhof group will become
accepted as leaders of the revolution.
What are you doing there?
That's my car!
Yesterday five arrests were made:
Attorney Horst Mahler,
student Peggy Schönau...
In the young woman's handbag,
police found a Belgian pistol.
The charges: possession of guns,
falsification of identity papers,
car theft, burglary,
theft and armed robbery.
In Mühlheim, Dortmund, and Konstanz,
the prisoners face similar charges.
Show me your identity papers.
Get back!
...further threats of violence...
The trial of Astrid Berger began today.
According to a study by
the Allensbacher Institute...
are sympathetic to the RAF.
That's about 7 million people.
Which makes finding
them a lot more difficult.
Lobster soup.
So we plan to
computerise identity papers.
I'll explain by
giving you an example.
Underground terrorists naturally
hide their identities from authority.
Without the new ID card...
no bank account.
Now they'll find it hard
to rent somewhere to live.
Everything will require
the new cards. Gas, water, electricity.
In Frankfurt alone, 16,000
customers usually pay bills in cash.
We will no longer accept cash.
All customers will have to use their new ID.
No ID: no health care, either.
- And then?
Then we take it further. For example,
No ID: no driving license,
no child support payments.
If everyone has to have an ID,
the last handful who don't: suspects.
That is a mathematical certainty.
In the long term it does
nothing to smash heads.
Or, as some would prefer,
to cut heads off.
Not the police,
but political powers
resistant to change,
allow terrorism to develop.
That is my opinion.
Oh, and say hello to
the minister for me.
Shit!
Floor it!
Halt!
Freeze!
Hands up! You too!
Go! Go! Petra, go!
Drop your weapons!
Kiss my arse!
Stop, girl! Freeze! Hands up!
