Previously on Veronica Mars
This has nothing to do with us.
No. Your secret, illegitimate
child affects neither you nor me.
I found them in my daughter's room.
We were trying to help Grace.
They've been abusing her.
They had her locked in the closet.
Their adoption contracts are
all about religious indoctrination.
When I think of my child
brought up like that...
Astrid, if you're done gaping...
How can you put up with her?
She promised to pay my way
through grad school.
We're leaving now.
Honey, there's something
I need to tell you.
Meg died.
The baby?
She survived.
Hi, ho.
What did you say?
Oh, your uniform.
Hi, ho,
it's off to work you go.
I guess that makes me Snow White.
You must be on your
way up to see Mopey.
How's he doing, Sleazy?
Wouldn't know.
He doesn't come out of his room.
Old italian ladies
don't grieve like this.
Boy, he must have really loved Meg.
Well, then there's that other thing
you know,
he can't see his baby.
A baby?
How'd that happen?
There she goes...
the angel of mercy.
Time to fake the doughnut.
Uh-oh.
Did you catch him waxing his board?
What are you doing here?
I was invited.
How about you?
Lost?
Oh, quit standing there so smug.
Tomorrow you're just gonna call
me at 2:00 in the morning
saying you want some company.
For your information,
that really doesn't satisfy me, Logan.
Really?
You always come.
Logan told me what happened.
You got to let it go,
Ronnie.
Take a deep breath and let it go.
If you're gonna date
an heir to billions,
the occasional afternoon quickie --
you got to let it slide.
Cost of doing business,
you know?
Seriously,
girls like Kendall --
they let you do things
that girls like you --
well, let's just say,
you should be thankful.
Vile stuff, you know,
really vile stuff.
Move, Dick.
Just trying to be helpful.
So, where were you yesterday?
I stayed home.
No, you didn't.
I came by.
I stayed home, then in the
afternoon, I went for a drive.
I called your cell 10 times.
I had it turned off.
Yeah,
I figured that out.
God, what's your problem?
I needed some time to think.
My problem starts with
finding Kendall in your shower.
Kendall? She probably
got the bedrooms confused.
Don't lie to me!
I trusted you the first time.
But not anymore.
I'm nobody's fool.
Perfect. Meg's dead.
I can't see my daughter.
But by all means Veronica
let's make this about you.
Why shouldn't it be like any other day?
God, shut up about Meg already!
I'm alive!
I'm your girlfriend!
Not anymore.
was everything
a man could want to do
Veronica.
Sorry,
I'll turn it down.
I'm coming in.
Honey.
I'm okay.
You  remember I'm a detective,
right, a pretty good one?
Duncan and I broke up.
Yeah, I got that.
Is there anything I can do?
Thanks.
Really I just need some time.
Anything  you need, Honey,
I'm here.
It's down to two guys.
Hector or Bootsy.
One of them stabbed Felix.
Thumper says they were the
only two left on the bridge
with you and him.
So, how we gonna figure out who did it?
The one that did it is the one who's
in business with the Fitzpatricks.
He's got a pipeline of coke, meth, "E".
You know anyone who can...
Yeah. I'll handle it.
I don't want to wait
Oh, that's just pathetic.
Up! Get up!
I came over here to see Veronica Mars.
Who's this emo girl?
Leave me alone.
I'm wallowing.
Not anymore.
We're going out.
We got to go see a movie or
get in a bar fight or something.
I don't want to get in a bar fight.
Tough, 'cause you're going
if I have to drag you.
But before we do,
Veronica, shower.
You smell bad.
You're not helping.
You think you're helping,
but you're not.
You'll be needing this.
And what's that?
A ticket to tomorrow
night's basketball game.
Ah, he reveals his true colors.
That's right.
I bleed the gold and green.
I'm a pirate born,
a pirate bred,
and when me die...
a pirate dead?
Big talk from a guy who only
moved back to Neptune to play ball.
If your Chicago high school
hadn't had their tryouts last year,
you'd still be there.
And if ifs and buts
were candy and nuts,
we'd all have a merry christmas.
What does that mean?
No clue.
Something my mom says.
Veronica, can you come here?
Honey, Duncan's missing.
What do you mean,
he's missing?
He's taken --
He's kidnapped the Manning baby,
but you already know, don't you?
What?
Veronica Mars, you're under arrest
as an accomplice in the abduction
and the disappearance of Faith Manning.
Find out more about this episode in our
dedicated topic on www.forom.com
Number five, step forward.
What was that all about?
You were picked
out of the lineup
by a merchant from
the L.A. Jewelry district.
Oh.
What do you mean, oh?
I was expecting shock and indignation.
Yeah, I know what
they must be thinking.
The witness claims you sold him some
earrings that belonged to Celeste Kane.
The sheriff thinks you're an accomplice
and that you helped Duncan plan
and finance this kidnapping.
That's a lot of thinking for Lamb.
He may tire himself out.
This is not a joke.
This is kidnapping.
What Duncan's done is wrong,
and if you've helped him in
any way, you're going to prison.
Now, straighten up.
I did sell the earrings,
Duncan asked me to,
but not to finance a kidnapping.
We had a plan.
A plan?
A plan to get custody of the baby...
legally.
Duncan wanted to hire a lawyer,
but he needed money.
Did you know the
earrings were Celeste's?
I  didn't ask.
Veronica.
I figured they were, but his
parents didn't want Duncan adopting.
Celeste isn't quite ready
to be a grandmother.
Veronica,
listen to me clearly.
You're gonna cooperate with Lamb.
You're  gonna answer every
question he asks, truthfully.
And when Duncan Kane is found,
and he will be found,
there's gonna be no doubt
whose side you were on in all this.
Understood?
Here's Veronica for you.
Hey, Veronica,
what's the haps?
Oh, you know, I didn't think
there'd be air conditioning, but...
other than that, this is pretty
much how I pictured hell.
She knows where my son is, sheriff.
I guarantee it.
If she doesn't cooperate fully,
I want her prosecuted for her
involvement in the theft of my jewelry.
What are you doing here?
Big case, missing person.
So, where do you got him stashed?
All right, enough.
I'll ask the questions.
You're only here as
a guest of mrs. Kane.
Mrs. Kane, a word of advice...
private investigators...
just make the work of law
enforcement officers more difficult.
Save your money. We'll find Duncan.
We'll bring him in safely.
It's kind of weird, huh ?
Hoping Lamb is competent
rather than betting he's not?
Keep me posted on any developments.
I find comfort in knowing
the child isn't yours.
Let's hope she's got your smile.
Mr. Vanlowe.
Sit.
Write down everything you can think of.
You know what I'm looking for --
fake I.Ds, secret credit cards,
hiding spots, favorite restaurants,
anyone who might let him borrow
a car or a vacation home.
Let me ask you a question.
Do you think the baby is
better off now with Duncan,
or with the Mannings?
I should have busted you that night.
Now my ass is in a sling
if I don't find the Kane kid.
You're not going home
tonight unless that pad is full.
When this is all over,
if you left anything off,
I will make it my mission to put
you in prison as an accessory.
Dig it out, baby.
Dig it out.
Make daddy proud.
Hey, listen, I need
you to do me a favor.
It's not that favor Bobby Brown
does for Whitney, is it?
No.
Yeah, then, what up?
I need you to try to buy some
ecstasy from a couple P.C.H.Ers.
Yeah, no sweat.
I'm like this with those guys.
Oh, no, honey,
bad set, bad set.
Don't make daddy hose you down.
You're not real complicated,
are you, Dick?
I try not to be.
That's everything.
Better be.
Waiting for your
girlfriend to make bail?
No, no, no.
Her shift ends at 5:00.
I'm  waiting for you, V-dog.
What for?
I thought maybe you'd tell me
where you're keeping Duncan,
save us all some time, you know,
earn some karma points.
I have no idea where he is,
and if I did,
you would be the...
last person I'd tell.
Am I hearing you right?
Because you'd tell Osama Bin Laden
before you'd tell me?
Because back in my day,
we had a little thing
called patriotism.
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.
It's a negotiation, right?
Okay, let's say I sweeten the pot.
Let's make it...
$5,000. The karma points
are yours to keep,
and if you act now, I'll throw
in a free set of steak knives.
I don't know where he is.
All right, say no more.
I gave it a shot.
You can't blame a guy for that.
Hey, Vinnie...
you dropped your pen in my bag.
You sure it's mine?
I don't think I'm missing a pen.
"Sugars cabaret invitational
long ball championship."
Pretty sure it's yours.
Veronica, 72 hours from now,
I'm gonna have that kid back,
and you'll wish you
had those steak knives.
The next question in the
search-engine olympics.
Contestants, get ready.
What is the Varsity Boys' basketball
team's record in district play?
Go!
I kill in this game.
See, while my nimrod
classmates are typing in
"Neptune High basketball"
and getting 50 pages of results,
all I have to do
is type in Wallace's name,
then click the most recent
box score, then...
box scores from Chicago?
Wallace lied.
He didn't come back to Neptune
to play basketball.
By the looks of this,
he was having a dream
season in Chicago.
Hey, what's the word?
The one they call bootsy told me no
and went on to suggest I perform sexual
intercourse upon my own person.
Doesn't he understand?
If you could do that,
you'd never come to school.
Boy, that's the truth.
Then after?
- Sold me 10 hits of "E"
-  Mint?
I gave you enough cash for 20.
He gave me the 09er discount,
charged me double.
And you paid it?
What's time to a hog?
Off me, boy.
If he came to the border, sheriff,
it was probably before anyone
knew the baby was missing.
We'd like to consider
scaling the searches back.
You know, I don't think
he's left town yet.
It's really a zoo down here.
If you could see it...
I understand perfectly what
this is doing at the border crossing.
Let me give it some thoughts.
I'd appreciate if you would, sheriff.
We could really use some relief.
Listen, I'm gonna check it out.
We've got the feds coming in.
Maybe we'll call off the dogs.
You've got company.
Not now.
It's the FBI.
I'm gonna have to get back to you.
- I'd appreciate if you would, sheriff.
- Yes. Bye.
Send them in.
Right in here.
S heriff?
Oh.
Agent Morris.
Agent Wills.
Sheriff Don Lamb.
Take yourselves a seat.
Thank you.
Now, sheriff, I think we should make it
clear right from the get-go
that we are here to get that baby back,
and we are willing to
combine our resources...
I'll share anything that you need...
...until such time as you piss us off.
And when that time comes...
and it usually comes
quickly in Sleepyburg or...
"world's biggest ball of Stringsville"
or wherever the hell
we are this week...
...when that time comes,
we will cut you out like
you were a meter maid.
You don't get the photo op,
and you don't get the fruit basket.
So, repeat after me.
Team.
Me.
Team.
Come on, you can do it.
Team.
Me.
Me.
Great.
So, why don't you get us up to speed
with what you've been doing here.
Is the sheriff around?
He's in with the FBI.
You're Veronica Mars, aren't you?
That's me.
I'm supposed to keep an eye on you.
Great.
You ever hit the clubs
in L.A., Veronica?
I'm 18.
Yeah, show me a club that'll care.
I moonlight over at club thin.
Club thin?
I'm a bouncer.
Well I didn't think
you were a cage dancer.
The reason why I ask --
you come up, I'll get you in.
Okay.
Cool.
Yes?
Sheriff, Veronica Mars
is looking for you.
She says she has something
you might be interested in.
Mars?
You mean the girlfriend?
Put her in interrogation.
Ex-girlfriend, ugly breakup,
from what I heard.
Before we go in there,
you should probably know something
about Veronica Mars.
We need to be careful with this one.
She's slippery.
Sheriff, we have interrogated
Al Qaeda members at Gitmo.
I think we can handle a teenage girl.
Nick and Jessica.
Is nothing sacred?
Whoa, Agent Wills,
call for backup.
- Just the chopper?
- Snipers.
What is it, Veronica?
Who are the suits?
Agent Morris, agent Wills...
...they're with the FBI.
What do you got?
Duncan may have taken his computer,
but he had a .Mac account.
He used it to back up his laptop.
What's a .Mac?
Online storage.
Users can back up their files or...
synchronize their computers,
calendars, addresses.
Browser bookmarks.
It wasn't on your list?
I just thought of it,
and I came straight here.
I can get a warrant
so we can search it.
Yeah, get the computer
boys to break the password.
Sheriff, border patrol on line one.
Border patrol?
Don't bother.
Duncan hates Mexico.
Is that so, brer rabbit?
Yeah, this is Lamb.
No, don't back off
those searches at all.
No, not at all.
Veronica, why don't you
wait outside in the hall?
Why don't you?
Your next option is a cell.
We'll take a coffee
when you get a minute.
- Sacks, two coffees.
- What?
So...
the FBI.
I've thought about it,
you know?
But big fish, small town has its perks.
Still, who knows?
I still might apply.
You go to college?
For a year.
Blew out a knee at southwest
Texas playing ball.
Speak a foreign language?
A little mexican,
enough to get by.
I tell them to turn their music down.
Any expertise in computer science, law,
physics, chemistry,
forensics, mathematics?
Expertise?
Small town, big fish...
You know,
I'd ride with that.
I don't know what
you're talking about, Weevil.
I'm not in business
with the Fitzpatricks.
I know you're lying,
Hector.
I know you sold "E"
to an 09er just today.
That?
Yeah, that.
You did it,
didn't you?
Yeah, but I didn't get it
from the Fitzpatricks.
Some white boy asked
me to get him some.
He looked dumb and desperate,
so I said I'd get it
for him at $40 a hit.
He said yeah, so...
So what?
So I got it from this other
white boy who I know deals.
He's lying.
What white boy?
What was so wrong?
I made a few bucks selling
from one 09er to another.
Come on. Like you know
an 09er drug dealer?
Who was it?
My sister works with his dad.
I want a name.
Veronica,
they got into the files.
They need you.
That was quick.
Two hours for the search warrant,
What was it?
Enak gem.
What?
What's she gonna do with it?
Enak gem?
"Meg Kane" backwards.
Miss Mars,
what can you tell us about
Duncan Kane's sailing ability?
Duncan's been sailing
his whole life. Why?
Duncan bookmarked a boat for sail.
We tracked down the seller.
Turns out he sold it last week
to a teenage boy who paid cash.
I assume that's a generous
use of the term "we"?
I got a hundred bucks
says he's heading south.
What do you think Veronica? Want to put
your money where your mouth is?
How much does your
boyfriend hate mexico, huh?
Isn't gambling illegal?
That's what I thought.
It's the coast guard.
They spotted the boat.
It's ignoring their warning calls.
They're preparing to board.
That kid's gonna get himself killed.
Put it on the speaker.
There's no one on deck.
Our men are checking down below.
But we have found dirty diapers
and 12 empty cans of spaghettios.
What about history of mental issues?
Any chance that he just said,
"goodbye, cruel world"?
Duncan didn't kill himself,
and he didn't kill his baby.
Somebody picked him up.
He's still on the run.
Morning, Sam.
Morning, Ralph.
Fritter?
You should be out looking for Duncan.
Oh, right! Duncan Kane.
I got so swept up in your beauty,
I almost forgot my assignment.
If you do find him and
he gives you any trouble,
will you give him this?
Will do.
Oh, how the mighty have fallen.
Do you remember last year
when you looked down on me
like you were so much better?
Yeah. Did you get the impression
something has changed?
Well, yeah.
It seems both our families are
in the domestic staffing industry.
That makes us like family.
I steal cars. You sell drugs.
Hey, I can hardly tell
where you end and I begin.
I get it.
What can I get you?
A little crank,
some blow?
Just tell me the name of your supplier.
Yeah, that's not happening.
Is it the Fitzpatricks?
The Fitzpatricks?
They take a blowtorch to you
if you're short a dime bag.
I'm not that dumb.
Am I free to go?
Have a nice day.
You believe him?
Don't you?
One of my boys is mixed up
with the Fitzpatricks. I know it.
Has it crossed your mind that maybe
the one mixed up with the Fitzpatricks
is the one that's already dead?
You remember when Karen and Patrick
Fitzpatrick still went to school here
back when we were freshman?
They were like seventh-year seniors.
The only reason they stuck around was
to keep the high-school drug trade going.
As soon as this school got
smart and expelled them,
my predecessor...
the reaper, gus.
Yes, the reaper,
decided to expand our business.
A couple months in,
he disappears like Jimmy Hoffa.
No one's seen him since.
You know why the reaper
was called that?
He lost a bet?
His name...
Gustavio Toombs.
He was Felix's big brother.
So, no, Felix wasn't working
with the Fitzpatricks,
no way in hell.
Gonna eat your cake?
Take it.
I got a little present for you.
What is it?
Just a little scrapbook I put together.
You were kicking butt in Chicago...
Undefeated?
I wanted to tell you.
Why did you really
come back, Wallace?
If you read these stories, then you know
my new teammate was Rashard Rucker.
Is that supposed to mean something?
Yeah. He's the best high
school player in the nation,
this year's Lebron James.
Just before christmas,
me and Rashard,
a couple of guys on the team,
hit this house party.
Rashard had a few beers, but
he said he was okay to drive.
On the way home,
this wino staggered out
in front of the car.
Oh, Wallace.
He hit him.
I was yelling for him to stop,
but he panicked.
We drove to his uncle's.
His uncle's?
He's Rashard's agent,
manager, boss.
He said we probably hit a dog and
we should just keep our mouths shut.
"Millions of dollars are at stake."
But I couldn't just let it go.
I couldn't go to practice and
just pretend it hadn't happened.
So, I thought if I came back here,
I could just forget about it.
You know,
you could have told me.
No, I couldn't.
Why?
Because you would've stayed.
You'd have done the right thing.
I'm embarrassed I didn't.
Hello?
Veronica, it's me.
Duncan, what are you doing?
Where are you?
You got to turn yourself in.
Where I am isn't important.
I'm doing the right thing.
No, you're not.
You need to turn yourself in.
You're not ready to raise that baby.
We'll win in court.
There's no way I'll ever...
No, don't hang up.
Tell me where you are.
You know what the Mannings...
Duncan, you're gonna get
yourself thrown in prison.
They think I helped you.
You got it?
He's up in big bear.
Just give me five minutes.
I'll have it down to a building.
We can be there in two hours.
Sheriff, we appreciate
your time, your effort,
and your cooperation,
but we got it.
It's time.
Duncan, she's beautiful.
I know.
We're doing the right thing.
I think so.
You ready to travel?
Ready for a big trip?
The FBI is heading up to Big
Bear. We got to move.
Kendall?
Everyone bought it,
including her.
The boat?
The same.
Everything's in motion.
We got to go now,
or things are gonna fall apart.
Veronica,
slow down one minute.
After we leave this room,
we can't call each other,
e-mail each other,
see each other...
Stop.
Goodbye, Veronica.
I love you.
Always have, always will.
You better.
Sheriff.
Yeah?
We got a hit on Veronica's ATM card.
Where?
Mexico, a hotel near Jacumba.
It's big with american surfers.
I told them, didn't I?
Everything out of that
girl's mouth is a lie.
Let's see how the FBI likes it
when this high-school-educated
local lawman brings back the prize.
It's veronica.
Leave a message.
Veronica...
Hey, I need to see you
at home A.S.A.P., Kiddo.
We need a little
daddy-daughter time.
He knows you can shoot,
just like I know you can shoot.
Wallace fennel?
Yeah.
Ernie sayers,
chicago statesman.
I was hoping to ask
you a few questions.
The night of december 14th,
a homeless man was
the victim of a hit-and-run.
You mind?
That man is paralyzed
from the waist down.
Now, a convenience-store clerk
who was locking up says...
...that the car that hit him was a red
hummer with 22-inch spinning rims.
Do you know how many of
those there are in Chicago?
Less than you'd think.
I talked to some kids
from your old school.
They said that you,
Rashard Rucker,
and a couple of teammates left a house
party around 2:00 A.M. that night.
So, what's the question?
I guess the question is,
what kind of man were
you planning on being?
I'm still a drunk,
I'm still a loser
¿usted lo ha visto?
No.
But you all look alike to me.
Try the restaurant up the road.
If they take you away,
if you're sent to prison...
You read the letters,
though, right?
From Meg to child protection services...
they're about her parents.
It's not just your life you're
gambling with, Veronica.
I would not survive without you.
Do you understand what you've done?
We had to do it.
I know you think you did.
We did.
You played me, Veronica.
I had to.
I love you.
I'll always love you,
but I don't know how
I'll ever trust you again.
Mr. Mars, we have a warrant
to search your premises.
Is this really necessary?
Hasn't my daughter
cooperated in every way asked?
Funny thing happened
in big bear, mr. Mars.
There was no sign of
Duncan Kane anywhere.
But the manager of the condo did
show a model unit to a cute,
young, blond woman.
We did find this mini cassette in
a dumpster behind the complex.
Where I am isn't important.
I'm doing the right thing.
There's no way I'll ever
get to keep the baby now.
I thought you'd understand.
I thought you'd help.
You know what the Mannings
would do to her.
Forget it. Forget it.
We'll go it alone.
And I asked myself,
"is it possible to have an unrehearsed
conversation with a tape recording?"
I don't think so.
Sounds like they got you, honey.
Well, think of the money
we'll save on a prom dress.
I'm gonna make a sandwich.
Anyone want a sandwich?
You're cool, mr. Mars.
You're very cool.
And you got a cool daughter.
But kidnapping cases don't go
away. You should know that.
Is that a no?
Almost done?
Getting there.
Oh, hey, man,
I got something for you.
What's this?
I was gonna put that on your buddy's
chest before he got himself killed.
Good-looking girl.
Who is it?
The name's Molly Fitzpatrick.
Couple of hours ago he asked me
where there was a grocery store,
but I didn't see a baby.
What did you tell him?
Another few miles, south,
past the old train station.
Thanks.
It might not be the guy, man.
You sure you got
jurisdiction down here?
Good luck, you all.
- Thanks.
- You too.
¿Necesita un paseo?
Sí, sí.
Gas, grass, or ass, kid...
nobody rides for free.
Pleasure doing business.
Ooh, you pay better than your mom.
You ready to see your daddy?
She won't let go of my finger.
She thinks you're Veronica.
Yeah, so does the FBI.
Hey, Lilly.
Daddy's here.
Everything's gonna be all right.
I recognize the voices
talking in my head
I couldn't make out
everything the voices said
I had you
and you had so much promise then
You promised me
that you would never leave again
To be broken
