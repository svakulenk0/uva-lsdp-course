Man:
Well, it's not a matter of right and wrong.
It's a matter of righter and wronger.
Man #2:
Righter and wronger?
Those are not words, Carlo.
Carlo:
Hey, that's what the judge said.
The judge said that
in a court of law.
He said righter and wronger,
right there.
"Pledge of Allegiance,"
all that bullshit.
What else did the judge say?
He said that people will,
you know, protect their lives
no matter what.
I mean, he didn't say it like that.
You know, he said it like
the fancy legal shit, but... but yeah.
He said people will protect
their lives no matter what,
something like that.
You heard
about what happened, right?
On the Belt Parkway.
You heard that?
- No.
- Yeah, I was on the Belt Parkway,
- like 65th Street...
- You were on the Belt Parkway?
Yeah, down by the pier.
I'm driving like a bastard
and, you know,
fucking cops pull me over, right?
They give me the breath test.
You know, I'm drunk off my ass,
right, and they lock me up.
So before I go in front of the judge,
my lawyer, he says to me...
he says,
"You know, you were so drunk that...
that it's considered a felony."
- Which means I broke parole.
- Yeah.
That's seven years.
I mean, no lies, Sal...
l... I felt like I was gonna
shit a bowling ball.
So I finally go in front of the judge.
He goes, "Can you please
explain what happened?"
And I said,
"Your Honor, look.
I'm in a bar,
I'm having a drink, right?
These two fucking guys come in,
they assaulted me.
The bashed me, you know,
smashed bottles over my head.
Yeah, there's bottles over my head
and kicked me in the face.
And to save myself,
I got in my car...
you know, I ran out of there,
I got in my car,
- and, you know, I drove off."
- Right. And he bought that?
Yeah, well, he bought nothing.
That's a true story.
- I got no...
- Oh, come on.
Hey, that's a true story.
Okay.
All right.
Okay.
Yeah, I owed all these bookies
and back then I didn't have
nothing to pay them, you know.
So somebody
in the bar called the cops.
But the judge,
he's listening to this
and he's...
you know, he looks like
he's gonna shit a bowling ball.
He says that this is not a simple case
of right and wrong,
but righter and wronger.
Because the defendant had
to break the law...
to protect his own life.
It's un-fucking-believable.
What happened to the cops?
Nothing. They were right
even though they were wrong.
And I was wrong
only because that I was right.
You see? You get that now.
- You get that, right?
- Yeah.
- Righter and wronger.
- Righter and wronger.
That's right.
- You're too much.
- You see what I'm...
-
-
-
-
-
- Yo, Tango!
We got that shit on deck!
-
-
Man: Hey, get your
motherfucking hands off me!
Reporter:
Still very active here at the BK projects.
Details are sketchy,
but here's what we know.
A young African-American man
named Allen Daniels
was allegedly shot
and killed by police.
We're hearing
it was one police officer
who was trying to rob him.
-  He's a good boy.
- It's gonna be okay, all right?
- He's a good boy!
- Reporter: Residents here are
- obviously outraged...
- My boy! My boy!
- Let's just kick it, man.
- Let's go.
Y'all little niggas know
what to do. Hurry up.
It's hot out this motherfucker.
There's police everywhere.
Yo, hurry up.
Yo, it's crazy right now.
What happened?
Tango. Come here, man.
Lemme holla at you real quick.
I thought you was
going back to school, B.
Come on, Tango.
What they gonna teach me
in there I ain't
already learning out here?
But you're gonna make
that court date, right?
Come on, Tango.
You know I'm gonna make the court date.
- You know I'm gonna make the court date.
- All right. Cool.
- What's going on here?
- Yo, these fucking pigs, man.
They done clap a little homey, man.
Shit crazy right now, boy.
- Word?
- Yeah.
-
-
Check it.
I don't wanna hear
y'all been spending y'all gwap
on these hookers either. You heard?
Wake up in the morning with
your dick looking like a trophy
with the mother.
Ask K Rock.
You know bitches be burning this shit.
Come on, man.
You better stop telling people.
We gonna go in the living room
and fuck with the PlayStation real quick.
Let me see you pop verse two, son.
- What up, Tang.
- What's up, man?
Man:
But yo, truthfully, man,
you know that was
you and your cousin that got shot.
- Man #2: Word up.
- Man: Stretched out.
- Three shots in the chest.
- Police are crazy. Wild.
Oh God!
Oh God!
Sal:
I did a bad thing...
but to a bad guy.
A very very bad guy, all right?
And for a good reason.
You think that's
a rationalization, right?
That's what you're thinking.
You're here.
So you've prayed for guidance.
No, I couldn't do that.
Priest: Why not?
'Cause prayers were
not gonna give me what I needed.
Is that more important
than your relationship with God?
No matter what you may have done...
- He's ready to forgive you.
- He is, huh?
We're all imperfect creatures...
and we're led to sin.
That's why we have to
surrender our souls to God.
Well, to be honest with you,
I've been here before, all right,
asking for God's help
a lot of times, okay?
And my situation is not getting
any sunnier, you know?
So... so why should it now?
Your pride is denying
the possibility of God's goodness.
Why does He get all the glory?
You know, why is that?
Huh? He gets all the glory
and I get all the blame.
I mean, is it not possible...
that maybe God
isn't carrying His end of the weight?
Look. This thing is
obviously weighing on you.
So release it.
Confess your sin.
Pray for forgiveness.
I don't want God's forgiveness.
I want His fucking help.
What? Is that so hard?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Let's just... let's do a few
"Hail Mary"s and go, okay?
Let's... thank you.
Thank you.
This has been really good.
Thank you.
"Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee;
blessed art thou amongst women,
and blessed is
the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners now
and at the hour of our death. Amen."
Thank you.
- Sal.
-
All right, everybody.
Listen up. Give me your ears.
All right, everybody.
Listen up. Give me your ears.
The BK projects,
you all know it.
The highest crime area
in the highest crime precinct.
Good morning, Sal.
Thanks for joining us.
Larceny, rape, prostitution...
it even takes the crown for kidnapping.
- It's estimated that over...
- Yo.
- What do you hear? What do you say?
- Not too much.
Oh, fuck.
Hey, what do you know about...
what's his name? ...Bobby Powers
with CI? You hear about that?
- Carlo?
- Yeah.
Found him with his face blown off
in a Town Car over by the cemetery.
Oh. They got any leads on that?
Carlo was a grade A asshole.
Everyone's a lead. Why?
No, nothing.
It's just... you know.
And now, the media
shovelling shit on our badges
over the shooting
that took place there.
We have to remind the public
that one man from this unit
cannot stain
the sum total of our efforts;
That we are not in the business
of harming the public but of helping it.
We've been entrusted
with the responsibility to protect
- those who cannot protect themselves.
-
This is where
we accomplish that, gentlemen.
Hey, Eddie, what are you doing here?
The bars close early?
I heard you let
another cuffed perp escape.
What's that, about six now?
Is he fucking laughing at you?
- Laughing? Are you laughing at me?
- I'll just slap your fucking mouth.
- Whoa whoa!
- I just wanna talk to him.
- No, just... don't...
- Are you laughing at me, man?
Forget about him. Come on.
Forget about him. Come on.
Fucking burn out, man.
-
- Nobody want you here, man.
Let's go.
Hey, you got my fucking "Playboy"?
- That's my "Playboy."
- That's mine.
- You boys starting trouble?
- No, Captain. No, sir.
Dugan.
See me in my office.
Five minutes.
Eddie:
I forget to fill something out?
Captain: Everything went fine.
Retirement's gone through.
Eddie: Great.
Captain:
How are you doing, Eddie?
You know.
Captain:
The wife?
Eddie:
You know.
Captain: Here's the deal.
Our commissioner,
he believes in this new program
that puts rookie cops
in the highest crime areas.
So they want
seasoned hairbags like you
breaking these recruits in.
Since you're the oldest here...
Hey, look,
if it's all the same to you,
I've got seven days.
I'm no one's teacher.
I'm not a role model.
God knows you're not, Eddie,
but your name came up
in the computer, pal.
This thing's been kicked up
by two months
and all eyes are on it.
Just do the best you can, okay?
Come on, Dugan.
Don't you want to do something useful
with your last two minutes on the job?
Not really.
What the fuck, Clarence?
I've been nursing this seat for 15 minutes.
Don't call me Clarence.
You order for me yet?
Yeah, pancakes, eggs and bacon.
- I told you...
- I know. I remembered turkey bacon.
I know that you don't eat the swine.
All right.
The drugs are in play.
All the principles are accounted for.
I haven't made contact
with the connect yet.
Again with Jersey, huh?
Fuck those racist crackers, man.
You know how they do, Bill.
Black man, black car,
profiling shit.
What am I supposed to do?
Just cave into them?
I played that shit perfectly.
In all fairness there was
Yeah?
Well, they didn't know that.
It's called tact.
You know what tact is, right?
I don't wanna play games
with you, Bill, all right?
Now you need to push harder
about me making grade.
- Talk to the chief.
- I know.
It's not like you haven't earned it.
You've earned it.
But it's just, I've told you,
these things, they take...
Time.
You keep saying that shit,
but you know that
I've put in more than e-fucking-nough.
What's happening?
What's going on? Why is this
all of a sudden so urgent, huh?
When that trooper
pulled us over last night...
-
...he gets me out of the car
and he's doing
his whole Gestapo bit, right?
My man and thems
in the car are ready.
Shotgun, he's on high alert.
Kid in the back, he's locked,
cocked and ready to rock.
- I ain't going back to jail.
- No, man, hold it. Hold it.
- No no no.
- I'm dying to bust my guns, man.
You know I can't stand
these motherfuckers.
Tango: This guy has no fucking idea
what's about to go down.
-
- Tango: You know what I'm thinking?
"Fuck it."
-
- "Let it be."
And then we get back to the Ps,
and I see the young brother
laid out on the concrete
and I find out how...
Next time you're on my road,
knock the speeding off.
I don't give a damn who you are.
...I start thinking, "We should've just
deaded them motherfuckers on the road.
It'd have been two to one,
but so what?
I'm good with those odds.
Fuck it."
You see what I'm saying?
I'm fucked up in the game, man.
You've got to get me out of here.
I'm gonna keep greasing the wheel
for you, see what we can do, okay?
Desk, suit, tie.
It's just something I need, okay?
I need that shit like water.
Can you look at something for me?
The kid you saw killed in the projects...
it gets worse.
He was an honor student,
a grad student.
The cop who shot him
was trying to rob him.
So of course when
the major newspapers get ahold of this,
the shit's really gonna hit the fan,
if you know what I mean.
Please tell me they caught
the son of a bitch.
Yeah, we caught him,
but the bosses are gonna wanna find
some kind of thing
that's gonna clean this up pronto.
So there's gonna be
some kind of play that goes down.
Some kind of play is gonna happen.
I don't know what it's gonna be,
but I need to know... I need to know
you're my boy out there.
- Oh, I'm your boy, huh?
- You know that's not what I meant.
You get in touch with Allisa?
L... she sent these.
They're divorce papers.
You know, I've got some lawyers'
names in there for you, a list of them.
I've got the department taking care
of everything for you, okay?
I want my life back, Bill.
I can see that,
and I'm working on it.
Please. Work harder.
The captain says you're retiring.
What did you say your name was?
Melvin Panton...
Lance Corporal, US Marines.
Marines.
Well, Lance Corporal Melvin Panton...
seven days from today
is 22 years for me.
Pension doesn't get
any better after that.
Seven days from today?
That's... that's my birthday.
You've been a cop
longer than I've been alive.
Ain't that something?
I can see you're married... the ring.
Separated.
You know, I've always wanted
to be on the force my whole life.
Yeah, it's true.
I had plastic handcuffs
when I was three.
Yeah, every Halloween
I always dressed as a cop.
I bet you find that
pretty corny, right?
But hey, I'm here now.
- Wait here.
- Woman: You know what? Fuck you.
Don't touch or do anything.
You got it?
Man: Stop it with the fingers
to the fucking face, all right?
Woman: Oh, yeah? What are
you gonna do? What are you gonna do?
Man: I'm gonna cut 'em right off.
Stop it with the fucking fingers.
- Every fucking...
- You'd better back down.
- Every fucking time you do that.
- You'd better fucking back down.
Get out of my face.
Get out of my face.
- Ah!
- All right, how about that?
- You're always talking to these guys.
- Woman: I ain't doing nothing.
- Man: Yeah, you are.
- No, I'm not doing... I was shopping!
You know what? You're fucking pissing...
don't you fucking start with me.
- Man: Get your finger out of my face.
- Don't start with me!
- All right? Get your finger...
- Hey! Hey hey hey hey, enough!
- Take a step back.
- Get the fuck outta here.
- I'm gonna ask you one more time...
- Who the fuck are you?
- All right, that's it. You're under arrest.
- That's good. That's okay.
Walk... walk... walk away. Walk away.
Walk away. What did I tell you?
- I said don't do anything, just sit there.
- He just hit her, man.
Hey, this is 64th Precinct.
We are what?
What are we?
- 65.
- 65th, right.
Was it Halloween that day
at the academy?
What the fuck is wrong with you?
You do not make
an arrest out of zone.
Get in the car.
Get in the car.
- Eddie. Eddie, it is...
- We'll talk about it in the car.
- You...
- Get in the car.
-
- Uh-huh.
Happy days are here again.
You've reached Allisa.
I can't come to the phone right...
Hey! Yo.
- Hey, calm down.
- Get the fuck away from my car.
Get a real fucking job, man.
-
-
Well, what if you turn on
the news tonight and she's dead?
- Hmm?
- I don't watch the news.
- It's depressing.
- You just...
You're just gonna act
like this never happened?
This is your first day, kid.
Today a woman gets hit.
Tomorrow it's a rape.
The day after that it's a murder.
- Dad! Dad!
- What's up, Dad?
Eddie:
You've got 20 years of days.
This job takes enough out of you.
Don't take it home.
In my book, that's called a coward.
Yeah, well,
I'm not much of a reader either.
- I'll eat in the car.
- Yeah, good.
Good idea.
Seven days, Eddie.
Seven days.
- You're the one that always...
- Shut up.
- You're asking him.
- You ask him.
You ask him.
You do it. Okay.
- Hey, Dad.
- Dad. Hey, Dad, Dad, Dad.
- Dad, turtle turtle...
- What did I tell you?
- What did I tell him about the turtle?
- You can't get a turtle until you get a room.
That's right. So now you go to
the pet store
and pick out two turtles, 'cause you boys
are gonna have your own room.
- Boys: Really?!
- Sal: Yes.
- Boy: Yeah!
-
- Sal: Dad here looking for a princess.
-
There she is.
There she is.
What are you doing, huh?
What are you doing?
- Look what I made.
- Oh, yeah? What is it? Is that me?
- Yeah.
- Is my head that big?
- Yeah.
- You better say no. You better say no.
Where's your mother, huh?
Where is she?
- No, where is she in real life?
- Angela: Sal.
- Go get her.
- Mom! Dad's home!
This is not enough, man.
What's this...
this is not enough.
This is not enough.
- This is... fuck!
- Angela: Watch your language!
What are you doing down there?
Come on, we're waiting for you.
No, l... fuck.
Sal, what are you doing?
Sal.

- Boy: Mom!

- Vicky: I didn't do it, Vinny did.
Angela: Come on, Sal.
Don't touch the glass.
Hello.

Oh. 50. 50?
On a bad day.
Ooh.
My man Tango.
You always were smarter

But on the strength, though,
I just wanna say thank you, man.
The lawyer you turned me onto...
shit, I don't know
what that motherfucker did,
but whatever it was...
I wouldn't have won
that appeal if it wasn't for him.
- Oh, man, that was nothing.
- Nothing?
Bullshit.
Yo, man, I've been running
with Red and them...
I ran with them motherfuckers
since free lunch,
and not one...
not one of them motherfuckers
came to see me, man.
Not a card, not a visit,

Nothing.
You different though, man.
Motherfuckers don't understand

You know

Vinny:
Fine, okay.

Mrs. Vincent called.

- "Where's the deposit?"
- "I need the deposit. Where is it?"
-
No, I'll call her tomorrow.
I thought... I thought... I thought
that wasn't gonna work out.
What? No.
No, there was a problem,
but every problem's
an opportunity, right?
Yeah. I just don't want you to build it up
too much for the kids, you know?
Oh shit, though. Did you see?
Oh, you should've...
Vinny and Vito when I told them
when I came in,
they were... they light up.
Oh. Yeah, we've been down
this road before though, you know?
No, we haven't.
We haven't been down this road.
Yeah, get their hopes up...
the swimming pool.
- Don't...
- I don't mean to be negative, but...
You don't mean to be negative,
but, you know... pop!

- No, it's...
it's gonna be all right, okay?
I promise you.
- I absolutely promise you.
- I just think you should keep it...

- No.
- No, this is not like before.
- Yeah, I do.
It is not like... come on, look at this.
This is our house.
We belong here.
Look at this.
Right here you have a little pool
for a little turtle for Mr. Vinny.
All right, over here you have
a little garden for Vicky.
And in here is the kitchen.
You've seen the kitchen, right?
- Yeah.
- Oh, this kitchen's gonna knock you out.
- Sal, I don't... Sal. Sal.
- You know, they've got this great...
- Sal, I believe you.
- No, you don't believe me.
Sal. Sal, you tell me
the sky's purple,
I'm gonna believe you, okay?
- Did you go to the doctor today?
- Yes.
- Yeah? What did he say?
- Yeah, l... yeah, I feel worse,
you know, and I should feel better
- than I do.
-
He goes on and on. It's just...
Yeah, well, you're still not
telling me what he said.
- Yeah, I know, 'cause you know why?
- Why?
'Cause I got dizzy... twice.
Oh, fuck. You're getting dizzy spells?
You're getting dizzy spells
- and you're not telling me?
- A little bit.
Angie, you cannot do that.
You've gotta tell me.
Okay? 'Cause it's the fucking mold
in these walls.
That's what it is.
You know it is.
It gets to your asthma.
It goes into your lungs.
No no no, baby.
No no no.
You need a new house.
I'm calling Mrs. Vincent right now.
Sal, I don't need anything.
I really don't.
Just you, babe.
No, you need a new house, okay?
Somebody needs to take care of you,
and that somebody is me, okay?

Don't fucking move.
Here we go.

Come on, I got this, man.

Yo, come on.
Hurry up.
- Go go go!
- Hands where I can see 'em.
What the fuck are you doing
by the window? What the fuck?
Where's the money?
Are you hiding money?
Did you throw it out the window?
You're fucking lying to me.
- Are you lying to me?
- No, I'm not.
- Where is the fucking money?
- Ain't no money.
Somebody out there? Huh?
Who's that? Who's that?
Hey! Get the fuck down.
Get the fuck down.
Do not even fucking
look at me, asshole.
- The money's left the building.
- Sal, what are you doing, man?
- Shut your fucking mouth.
- The money's left the building.
Stop!
- Hey!
- Aah!
Get off me!
- Do not fucking move.
- Get off me.
You hear me?
Do not fucking move.
Suspect got away.
Suspect got away.
- Please.
- Where's the money? Huh?
Where's the money?
What the fuck are you talking about?
I ain't got no money.
Don't got any money?
What are you running for
if you don't have any money?
I could have shot you
in the fucking back.
Get out of here. Get your shit and get
out of here before you get me in trouble.
What the fuck? Diapers?
What the fuck?
- Fuck! Holy shit!
- Shit.
Oh fuck.
- Hey, what's up?
- How you doing?
- That the botulism special?
- Hey, vamos, Tango.
Who's that at the table with Bill?
I don't even know, man.
Clarence... I mean Tango.
I'd like you to mean Special Agent...
Smith. Sit down, chief.
Smith comes in on all our big cases.
You've done some
very impressive work.
Got me promoted.
I thank you.
And my realtor really thanks you.
You want to tell me what I'm doing here?
You know,
when Washington got wind
of this dirty cop
shooting that grad student,
we had to step in.
A thing like that,
it messes people up.
They forget what side they're on.
They forget who the real enemy is.
Every now and then we've got
to come in and remind 'em.
Casanova Phillips.
Judge gave this scumbag
a get out of jail free card.
We want you to take that card away,
but we need evidence.
You put him on a deal
with our UCs and push it through.
Provide a location narco can hit.
Raid supplies the evidence
and I get myself a high profile arrest.
Yeah, well...
I respectfully decline your offer.
What the fuck is this?
You fucking kidding me?
How's Allisa your wife?
Oh, I'm sorry, that's soon
to be ex-wife, right?
Get out. Get out.
It's all right. Thank you.
Just give us a minute, please.
I heard she's remodeling your house.
On a cop's salary, huh?
You know, a whole lot of cash
has passed through your hands
over the last two years.
I ain't stole so much as a nickel
since I've been on the job.
You ain't got shit.
Oh, you do not want me to put
a microscope up your ass,
'cause if I do, I will keep looking
until I find something.
- Or you plant something?
- Watch that.
Now you listen to me.
You think you're a tough guy
'cause you did undercover
at Clinton Correctional?
You even survived a little incident.
If you know so much about me,
then maybe you should
stop fucking with me.
If you got a case, bring it.
But until that time, step off, dude.
Hey! Hey!
Wait.
Was this shit
supposed to be serious?
You expect me to stand there and listen?
Get the fuck out of here.
Don't let her get to you.
Don't let her get to you, okay?
She's about to become the head
of the New York division too.
- Can you believe that?
- What'd you get out of this, Bill?
- What'd I get out of it?
- Yeah, you got an upgrade?
You gonna be sergeant?
Captain? What?
Take it easy.
I'm on your side.
Now I understand you got
a history with this Phillips.
He saved my fucking life, man.
Hey, know why I'm here?
You do this,
you've got detective first grade.
It's real this time. Huh?
Approved yesterday.
Office of your choice.
Shift of your choice.
All you got to do is just get
through this one lousy thing.
You know, it's always
one more thing with you, Bill.
Hey, don't throw this away.
- Hey, Tango.
-
Don't throw this away.
This is your life.
Sal: All right, let's up the ante.
Five buck ante.
Let's do it.
Let's play like men.
- Put your five bucks in.
- I already anted.
So you guys hear
the latest
on Bobby Powers?
I'm gonna slap you.
Come on.
Word is he was in on this
insurance scam with the mob.
He is so fucked.
Wait a minute.
If his old lady moves out on him
because of this, I call first dibs.
Come on, no wives,
no girlfriends, man.
So one of these wiseguys gets pinched
for some drug thing in Jersey
and to save his own ass he rats
on Bobby for guess what?
- Robbing dealers in Brooklyn.
- Prick.
I'll never get that. If you're gonna do
something wrong there's a risk.
If you can't handle the risk,
you shouldn't do it in the first place.
Yeah, one bad cop
makes us all look bad.
Ronny, are you retarded?
I'm talking about the mob guy
who ratted him out.
Boy Scouts of America over here.
Girl Scout. Yo, throw me
a couple cookies, huh?
Come on, Ronny. These wiseguys,
they break the law to become wiseguys.
And then soon as shit goes bad
they break their bullshit mafia codes
to get witness protection under the same
laws they were breaking in the first place.
Wait wait wait wait.
I wasn't talking about the fucking mafia.
I was talking about us.
Cops.
I don't know about you, Pat,
but I think we're too good
to take drug money, right?
I say get off your high horse.
There's no civilians in the room.
- You gonna call?
- I'm in, baby.
- Okay.
- Read 'em and weep.
- You too, Brutus?
- Read 'em and weep.
Cheddar coming, kid.
That's it, baby.
Give me that money, kid.
I love the smell.
Would you do it? Tell 'em.
Sal, come on.
We all know where that money goes.
Better still, we know
where it doesn't go.
It's not going to rehab clinics.
That money is not going to junkies
to help with their families.
It sure as shit is not going to us,
'cause I haven't had a raise
in four years, all right?
They got millions
of dollars sitting in an office
waiting to get shoveled
to the city's excess fund,
and you know what that is.
It's city big shots decorating
their offices with mahogany desks
and Persian rugs, right?
All with drug money.
We risk life and limb
taking and giving money
to scumbags who don't deserve it.
So far be it for me to wag my finger
at somebody
who's looking out for himself.
You guys want to take
the soapbox away here?
You brought a tear
to my eye right there.
Hey, fuck you guys.
Don't act like you don't know
what I'm talking about.
I'm on your side.
The city's got no respect for cops.
I mean, what's the starting pay?
$20,000.
All right, 20 fucking grand.
Come on.
Who's gonna raise a family on that?
All right, that's it.
That's the worst part of it.
All right, the $100,000 they pay your family
if you get killed in the line of duty.
Fat lot of good that does anybody.
You're worth more to them
dead than alive, man
You know what?
Shoot me in the fucking face.
My girl needs a new car.
Hey, don't you touch that gun.
Again, the point that you've got to be
a fatality to provide for your kids...
- Daddy.
- Shit, I told you don't come down here.
Shit.
Nobody touch the cards or the...
shit, I told you
not to come down here, all right?
Nobody touch the money.
Nobody touch the cards.
What are you doing down here?
What, Vinny? Vinny, what?
Daddy, Vinny keeps coming in my room.
We're trying to get dressed.
What is that skirt?
What are you doing?
Um, what is this smoke?
- All right, see what I told you?
- Touché.
All right, don't worry about the smoke.
Don't tell your mother.
Here, you and Myeisha take this.
Go out and have
a good time, all right?
I love you.
Give me a kiss.
- Bye, Myeisha.
- Good bye.
- Bye, have fun.
- Change that skirt.
People will start to think
we're Catholic only on Sundays.
Yo yo, Sally Sal, I didn't realize
you were living in Harlem.
-
- Watch your mouth.
Don't fuck around, Patrick.
We don't talk like that in this house.
Not in front of my kid.
I dig it over here
on Malcolm X Boulevard.
- Oh no, you didn't.
- Yes, I did, my nigga.
- See you later, Dad.
- Ronny: Hey, Pat.
You want me to come over there
and kick your ass?
- Is that what you want?
- Ooh.
- You know my wife is black.
- Of course I know your wife is black.
My shorty is black. Don't we go
shopping for cocoa butter together?
Now that's it!
- You racist prick!
- What the fuck is wrong with you, man?
What the fuck, Sal?
Fuck you, I'm a fucking racist.
I would take a bullet for you, Sal.
Not in front of my kids.
I listen to your shit all day long.
Come on, George, get off of me.
What the fuck, Sal?
Take it outside.
Take it outside.
- You're dead, man.
- Just take him upstairs.
Take him upstairs for five minutes.
Just give us five minutes.
That's all I need is
someone fucking with my game.
What's going on?
Ronny, I'm in trouble.
Okay.
Angie's expecting twins.
Twins?
You lucky bastard.
Congratulations. That's a problem?
Ronny, I ain't got room for twins.
Sure you do.
You've got room here.
Ronny, if I don't get a new house
or get some more bread,
I got to tell one of these kids
that they got to move in with my sister.
How am I gonna do that?
How am I gonna tell one of 'em
that you're the one
that's got to go?
I can't do that.
You don't have to do
that right away, all right?
I mean, how big are twins?
They're like this size.
Keep 'em in a drawer
for the first year.
Don't worry about it.
You know what I'd give for one?
You're a lucky guy.
- You know something? You're right.
- This ain't a problem.
Mrs. Vincent, it's Sal.
I have the money
for the down payment.
Mrs. Vincent:
You've got the whole thing?
No, actually I don't
have all the money.
Mrs. Vincent:
Is there a problem?
No no, there's not a problem.
The situation is just complicated,
that's all, Mrs. Vincent.
No, I know the deadline is Tuesday.
There's no problem about the deadline.
I'm gonna have it well
before the deadline.
That's not a problem.
All right? Hand to God.
Oh fuck.
No, you don't got to keep thanking
me about the violations thing.
- It's not a problem.
- I appreciate it.
Well, I appreciate you keeping
the house off the market for me.
- Otherwise I couldn't afford it.
- How can you?
How can I afford it?
Um...
You know what, Mrs. Vincent?
You hear that train?
I got another train coming by in
a second so why don't I just do this...
I'm gonna call you back
when I have all the money
and then we can figure out
a time to meet.
- Okay, God bless you.
- Okay, God bless you too, okay?
Shot him down! Shot him down!
NYPD shot him down.
Fuck the police.
Officer:
Back up, please. Back up.
- NYPD shot him down.
- We ain't scared of you no more.
Officer Dugan.
Some guy,
I think he's the captain,
he said that the guy I was with
yesterday is going with your guy
and I'm with you.
I don't know why
they keep switching us.
Officer:
Stay behind the barricade.
Get inside.
No, the other side.
Officer:
Back up, people. Back up.
- Eddie Quinlan.
- Windows up.
Listen, kid, I'm not sure
what you did yesterday
or how you did it, but today we're gonna
do things a little different, all right?
Yeah.
Man on radio:
Central Aviation 1, be advised.
Verify arson explosion.
Respond with Central.
Woman on radio:
Copy that. All medical units respond.
Man on radio: Central Aviation 1, be
advised I'm in the vicinity of BK housing.
We have an RMP on fire.
Woman on radio:
Part of a 904. Part of a 904.
Man on radio: Can you get
an eye on that second building?
Come on, cop.
I was an eyewitness.
So I could get...
I could get posted here?
Woman on radio:

Any units in the vicinity
of 742 Rockaway Avenue,
a reported 10-10 in progress.
The owner...

Quinlan:
I'm allergic to fire
and this gun is a lot lighter
than a mailbag.
You sure got everything figured out.
How could I not, right?
Just live long enough to get
a retirement good enough
to have a nice pension
and what else is there?
What are you gonna do between
now and that pension?
I'm gonna do the job.
And what's the job?
The job.
Yeah, right.
It's not what you expect.
It's never going to be.
It couldn't be.
Just keep your eyes open
and keep walking.
Whoa, you all right?
- I'm cool.
- Okay.
But I have won my appeal.
Oh, they can do that shit?
Appeal the appeal, huh?
Whatever.
What's up?
These motherfuckers is rabid, man.
They're thirsty.
They want to eat up all the food, man.
What you mean?
Fucking lawyer's telling me
they're talking about charging me
with some shit from 10 years ago.
That's just gonna get thrown out.
Don't worry about that.
That shit ain't gonna stick.
Fucking freedom ain't free, boy.
I'm telling you.
I'm putting these motherfucker's
grandchildren through college.
Officer:
Hey hey hey.
Uniform got popped in
Bed-Stuy, didn't make it.
New guy, Melvin Panton.
Jesus fucking Christ.
It's a fucking shame,
a young guy like that.
Probably just starting a family.
Yeah yeah, probably.
Probably did.
Hey, Sal.
It's Angela.
- Tell her I'll call her back.
- She says it's important.
All right.
- Get up.
-
- Oh, thanks.
- Any news?
No, nothing. Nothing.
Angie's as tough as they come.
She'll pull through.
She'll be back to calling you
an asshole in next to no time.
Thanks.
Anytime.
Oh shit.
Yeah, hi.
How are you?
Yeah, I'm aware that
the deadline is tomorrow.
I'm well aware of that.
But the good news is it's all settled.
Uh-huh, all good. Yup.
No, l... well, I can't really
talk right now.
But if you call me in the AM
I'll do it first thing.
Yeah yeah yeah.
Okay.
You too. Bye bye.
Everything okay?
Mr. Rosario.
Yeah, hey. So the asthma?
Well, your wife has significant traces
of wood mold in her lungs.
- Wood mold.
- When you have wood inside your house
- the particles travel in the air...
- I know all about the mold.
Well, if your wife's case,
because of her asthma
her lungs are working three times
as hard as they should,
which is jeopardizing her and the twins.
One of the babies is significantly
smaller than the other.
- But they're okay though?
- For now.
Mr. Rosario, have you
considered moving?
Yeah, I have.
- Fuck you, man. Fuck you.
- Whoa whoa.
Whoa whoa whoa!
He accused me
of stealing fucking candy.
Stop. Whoa! Whoa!
Hey hey! Stop!
Calm down, everybody.
Just...
You hear me now?
Huh?
We got this shit working like clockwork.
You want to go and fuck up our money?
Get your little bitch ass up, man.
- Don't kill me.
- What'd you tell them niggas, huh?
- Don't kill me, man.
- I can send your ass.
Uh-huh, I hope your ass
can fly, nigga.
Do your little ass dirty.
Go go go.
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Get the fuck down.
Stay the fuck down
and keep your mouth shut.
What are you doing?
Get the fuck off me.
Get that shit in the bag.
Get it in the bag. Hurry up.
Here they come.
Come on.
