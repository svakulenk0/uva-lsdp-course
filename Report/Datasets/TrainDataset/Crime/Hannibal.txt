BARNEY: Sometimes
Dr. Lecter and I would talk,
when things got quiet enough,
about the science courses
I was taking, and...
CORDELL: Some kind of mail-order courses
in psychology, Nurse Barney?
No, sir.
See, I don't consider psychology a science,
and neither did Dr. Lecter.
Now, Barney,
while you were working at the asylum,
you observed Clarice Starling
and Hannibal Lecter interacting.
Interacting?
CORDELL: Talking to one another.
Yes. Yes, it seemed to me that they...
I can see you're eager to justify
your consulting fee,
but why don't we start
with what you saw,
not what you thought
about what you saw?
VERGER: Cordell, don't be like that.
Barney can give us his opinion.
Barney, give us your opinion
of what you saw.
What was it between them?
Well, most of the time,
Dr. Lecter didn't respond at all to visitors.
He'd just, for instance,
open his eyes long enough
to insult some academic
who was there to look over him.
With Starling, he answered her questions.
She interested him. She intrigued him.
He thought she was charming
and amusing.
So, Clarice Starling and Hannibal Lecter
became friendly?
Well, inside a kind of formal structure, yes.
And he was fond of her?
Yes.
Thank you, Barney.
Thank you very much for your candor.
And keep all those wonderful items
from your personal
Lecter treasure trove coming,
I've enjoyed them immensely.
Mr. Verger.
Oh, I almost forgot.
I might be able to get a cookie down.
What do you say, Cordell?
I think it would kill you.
-How much?
-250,000.
Cordell, cut a check for $250,000.
How can she sleep at a time like this?
She's on jump-out squad all night,
she's saving her strength.
CLARICE: All right, everyone,
pay attention. Here's the layout.
Excuse me. I'm Officer Bolton, D.C. Police.
Yes, I can see that from your badge.
How do you do?
I'm in charge here.
Officer Bolton, I'm Special Agent Starling.
And just so we don't get off on the wrong
foot, let me explain why we're all here.
I'm here because I know Evelda Drumgo.
I've arrested her twice on RICO warrants.
DEA and ATF,
in addition to backing me up,
are here for the drugs and the weapons.
You're here because our mayor
wants to appear tough on drugs,
especially after
his own cocaine conviction,
and hopes he can accomplish that
by having you join us here today.
You got a smart mouth, lady.
Officer, if you wouldn't mind,
I'd appreciate it if you'd let me continue.
All right, take a look.
Fish market, back's on the water.
Across the street, ground floor,
is the meth lab.
Evelda Drumgo is HIV positive.
She will spit and bite if she's cornered,
so you should watch it.
And if you happen to be the one
who puts her in a patrol car
in front of the news cameras,
Officer Bolton,
you don't wanna push her head down,
she'll likely have a needle in her hair.
CLARICE ON RADIO: We wanna take her
inside the building, not out in the street.
We can get closest with the van.
If it looks good, on my signal,
we hit the front, DEA hits the back,
DCPD backing them up.
She'll have her watchers out
at least three blocks around.
They've tipped her before in time,
so let's not make spectacles of ourselves.
-Pretty busy today.
-MAN: I agree.
Can I please get a cup of coffee?
-Did you see that?
-That's a roger.
-What's up, man?
-Hey.
Goddamn it. It's her, with three guys.
They're all packing.
She's carrying something.
She's got a baby.
Hey, Brigham, it's too crowded.
There are too many people.
I say we call it off. What do you say?
I agree.
All units, stand down.
-Whiskey Team copies.
-Burke copy.
This is Bolton. Stay on target.
I said all units stand down, Bolton,
right now.
-BOLTON: It's too late, we're moving in.
-Hey, Bolton, he said it's off.
Stand down, now.
She's carrying a baby.
I repeat, she's carrying a baby.
All units stand down.
OFFICER: Keep that gun down, Bolton.
-Damn, dude got a piece.
-Light his ass up.
-Son of a bitch!
-It's a go. FBI, get on the ground!
CLARICE: Hold it!
Hold your fire!
Down!
Evelda, get out of the car!
Starling, is that you?
Step away from the car!
Show me your hands, Evelda.
Please, show me your hands.
-How have you been?
-Don't do this.
Do what?
It's all right. It's okay.
I know, I know.
Baby, I know. It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.
NEWSREADER ON TV: Friends, family,
and co-workers gathered here this morning
at Arlington National Cemetery
to bury BATF agent John Brigham,
shot and killed in the line of duty, Friday.
He was 40 years old.
This ill-fated drug raid,
that claimed his life and five others,
is the latest in a seemingly
endless series of incidents,
beginning with Waco, Texas, in which
the Justice Department and the FBI
have been questioned
about their use of firepower
rather than judgment.
This time,
it was FBI Special Agent Clarice Starling
heading up the calamitous strike force.
Agent Starling attained some measure
of celebrity 10 years ago,
when she was given information
by Dr. Hannibal "the Cannibal" Lecter,
which led to the rescue
of Catherine Martin, daughter of
the former U.S. senator from Tennessee.
However, when she returns
to work later this week,
she won't be so celebrated.
Attorney Telford Higgins,
representing one of the families
of those slain,
says he will file a wrongful death suit.
Cordell.
-Yes, sir.
-Get me the Justice Department.
ELDRIDGE: Agent Starling?
This is John Eldridge from DEA.
Assistant Director Noonan,
of course, you know.
Larkin Wayne from our
Office of Professional Responsibility.
Bob Sneed, ATF.
Benny Holcombe, assistant to the mayor,
and Paul Krendler.
You know Paul.
Paul's come over from Justice
unofficially, as a favor to us.
In other words, he's here,
and he's not here.
So, I take it you've seen the coverage
in the papers, and on television?
I have nothing to do with the news,
Mr. Krendler.
The woman had a baby in her arms.
There are pictures.
You can see the problem, I would think.
Not in her arms,
in a carrier across her chest.
In her arms, she had a MAC-10.
Look, we're here to help you, Starling.
It's gonna be a hell of a lot harder to do
with a combative attitude.
Can I speak freely, Mr. Pearsall?
Your agency called this office
to get me assigned
to help you on this raid.
I tried to do that.
I clearly expressed my judgment,
and was ignored,
and now a good agent,
and a friend, is dead.
You shot and killed five people out there,
Agent Starling.
Is that how you define good judgment?
This raid was an ugly mess.
I ended up in a position
where I had a choice of dying,
or shooting a woman carrying a child.
I chose.
I shot her.
I killed a mother holding her child.
And I regret it, I resent myself for it.
All right, gentlemen,
I'm going to call a halt to this meeting
and get back to you individually by phone.
Waste of time.
You have a secret admirer, Starling.
Isn't much to look at,
but he does have friends in high places.
Remember Mason Verger?
Lecter's fourth victim,
the rich one.
The only one that survived.
He says he has some new information
on Lecter. He'll only share it with you.
CLARICE: What do you mean, only share it
with me? You want it, seize it.
We'd rather not.
I wasn't speaking to you, Mr. Krendler.
When I speak to you,
you'll know it, because I'll look at you.
Why would we rather not?
The last time he called
was when we took Lecter off
the Ten Most Wanted list.
He was upset about that.
We said, "Hey, that's life."
He said, "Hey, this is
a Senate oversight committee,
"to make your life miserable."
His family's political contributions
may not be enough to buy a senator,
but they are enough to rent them
from time to time.
There's no reason to go through that again
if he really does have something new.
KRENDLER: It's a good deal for you,
Starling. You can't pretend it isn't.
You get to go back on a celebrated case.
I'll take care of the media
for your Drumgo killing.
-Everyone's gonna be happy.
-I'm not happy.
Well, maybe you're incapable
of being happy.
Mr. Krendler,
when you're out on the street,
you know you might take
a bullet in the line of duty.
You accept it, or you get out.
You live with it.
What you don't expect, or accept,
is taking one in the back
in your boss' office
for doing your job
exactly as they've taught you.
That makes you unhappy.
Of course, you're right, Starling,
but it doesn't really change anything.
It changes everything. It changes me.
Agent Starling, hi.
I'm Cordell Doemling,
Mr. Verger's private physician.
How do you do?
If you'd be so kind
as to park down at the end.
One's eyes adjust to the darkness.
NEWSREADER ON TV: ...versus
an estimate of 16.
Dylan, they're saying sales
have slowed down.
Seems like a recurring theme here.
Perhaps corporate spending
on a slowdown...
CORDELL: Mr. Verger,
Agent Starling is here.
Good morning, Mr. Verger.
VERGER: Was that a Mustang
I heard out there?
Yes, it was.
-A five liter?
-CLARICE: Yes.
Fast.
Cordell, I think you can leave us now.
I thought I might stay.
Perhaps I could be useful.
You could be useful
seeing about my lunch.
I'd like to attach this microphone
to your clothing or your pillow,
if you're comfortable with that.
Oh, by all means.
Here, this should make it easier.
You know, I thank God for what happened.
It was my salvation.
Have you accepted Jesus, Agent Starling?
-Do you have faith?
-I was raised Lutheran.
That's not what I asked.
This is Special Agent Clarice Starling,
deposing Mason R. Verger
on March 20, sworn and attested...
-I wanna tell you about summer camp.
-Mr. Verger...
-It was a wonderful childhood experience.
-We can get to that later.
No, we can get to it now.
You see, it all comes to bear.
It was a Christian camp my father founded
for poor, unfortunate,
castoff little boys and girls
who would do anything for a candy bar.
Mr. Verger, I don't need to know
about the sex offenses,
-I just have to...
-No, it's all right.
I have immunity from the U.S. Attorneys,
and I have an immunity
from the Risen Jesus.
And nobody beats the Riz.
Had you ever seen Dr. Lecter
before the court assigned you
to him for therapy?
What do you mean?
Socially?
That is what I mean.
Yes, if you don't mind talking about it.
-Oh, not at all. I'm not ashamed.
-I didn't say you should be.
No. We met conventionally,
as doctor and patient.
How did he end up at your house?
I invited him, of course.
To my pied-à-terre.
I came to the door
in my nicest "come hither" outfit.
I was concerned he'd be afraid of me,
but he didn't seem to be afraid of me.
That's almost funny now.
I showed him my toys,
my noose setup, among other things.
It's a way you sort of hang yourself,
but not really.
It feels good while you...
Well, you know.
Anyway, he said, "Mason..."
Mason, would you like a popper?
And I said, "Would l?
"Oh, wow."
Once that kicked in, I was flying.
He said, "Mason, show me how you smile
"to gain the confidence of a child."
Then I smiled.
He said, "Oh, I see how you do it."
The good doctor approached me
with a piece of broken mirror.
"Try this."
Try peeling off your face.
"And feeding it to the dogs."
LECTER: No. I can still see it.
Try again.
No, I'm afraid not.
That's entertainment!
It seemed like a good idea at the time.
Mr. Verger, you indicated to me that you'd
received some kind of new information.
Cordell.
Where did this come from?
Buenos Aires. I received it two weeks ago.
Where is the package it came in?
Good question.
There was nothing written
on it of interest.
Cordell, did we throw it out?
Yes, I'm afraid we did.
Oh, dear. You think it'll help?
I hope so.
I hope it'll help you catch him,
to help cleanse the stigma
of your recent dishonor.
Thank you. I think that's all I need.
Did you find some rapport with Dr. Lecter,
in your talks at the asylum?
I know I did, while I was peeling.
We exchanged information in a civil way.
-But always through the glass?
-Yes.
Isn't it funny?
What's that?
You can look at my face,
but you shied when I said
the name of God.
Finding what you want?
Are you sure this is all of it?
That's all there is now. There was more,
but it's been picked over
little by little over the years.
You know, this stuff's worth
a lot of money in certain circles.
It's kind of like the cocaine
that disappears around here,
little by little.
Let me go!
Hey, Barney.
Remember me?
Would you agree for the record,
Agent Starling,
that I've not been read my rights?
I have not Mirandized Barney.
He is unaware of his rights.
So, when you turned Dr. Lecter over
to the Tennessee police...
They weren't civil to him.
They're all dead now.
Yeah, they only survived his company
three days.
You survived him six years at the asylum.
How'd you do that?
It wasn't just being civil.
Yes, it was.
Did you ever think after he escaped
he might come after you?
No. He once told me
that whenever feasible,
he preferred to eat the rude.
"Free-range rude," he called them.
What about you?
You ever think he might come after you?
You ever think about him at all?
Oh, at least 30 seconds of every day.
I can't help it.
He's always with me, like a bad habit.
Do you know what happened to his stuff?
His books, papers, drawings...
Everything got thrown away
when the place closed. Cutbacks.
Barney, I just found out
that Dr. Lecter's signed copy
of The Joy of Cooking
sold to a private collector for $16,000.
It was probably a fake.
The seller's affidavit of ownership
was signed Karen Phlox.
Do you know Karen Phlox? You should.
She filled out your
employment application,
only at the bottom, she signed it "Barney."
Same thing on your tax returns.
You want the book?
Maybe I can get it back.
I want the X-ray they shot
after you broke Lecter's arm
during the attack on that nurse.
And everything else you got.
We used to talk about
a lot of things at night,
after the screaming finally died down.
We talked about you sometimes.
You wanna know what he said?
Go get the X-ray.
-I'm not a bad guy.
-I didn't say you were.
Dr. Chilton was a bad guy.
After your first visit,
he started taping
your conversations with Dr. Lecter.
These are valuable.
Go on, now.
You've grieved long enough.
And what'd he say?
What'd he say about me, late at night?
Well, he was talking about inherited,
hard-wired behavior.
He was using genetics
in the roller pigeons as an example.
They fly way up in the air,
roll over backwards in a display,
falling toward the ground.
LECTER ON TAPE: There are shallow
rollers, and there are deep rollers.
You can't breed two deep rollers,
or their young, their offspring,
will roll all the way down,
hit, and die.
Agent Starling is a deep roller, Barney.
Let us hope one of her parents was not.
Surely, the odd confluence of events
hasn't escaped you, Clarice.
Jack Crawford dangles you in front of me,
then I give you a bit of help.
Do you think
it's because I like to look at you
and imagine how good you would taste,
Clarice?
CLARICE: I don't know. Is it?
LECTER: I've been in this room
for eight years now, Clarice.
I know they will never, ever
let me out while I'm alive.
What I want is a view.
I want a window where I can see a tree,
or even water.
I want to be in a federal institution,
far away from Dr. Chilton.
The Capponi correspondence
goes back to the 13th century.
Dr. Fell might hold in his hand,
his non-Italian hand,
a note from Dante Alighieri himself,
but would he recognize it? I think not.
Gentlemen, you have examined him
in medieval Italian,
and I will not deny
that his language is admirable
for a straniero, but
is he acquainted with the personalities
of the pre-Renaissance Firenze?
I think not.
What if he came upon a note
in the Capponi Library,
say, from Guido de Cavalcanti?
Would he recognize that?
I think not.
They're still arguing.
The Capponi correspondence
goes back to the 13th century.
Sogliato wants the job for his nephew,
but the scholars seem satisfied
with the temporary guy they appointed.
If he's such an expert on Dante,
let him lecture on Dante to the studiolo.
Let him face them if he can.
-I look forward to it.
-Let's set a date.
MAN: Very well. On the 14th.
Dr. Fell?
Chief Inspector Rinaldo Pazzi
of the Questura.
Commendatore. How can I be of service?
I'm sorry.
I'm investigating the disappearance
of your predecessor,
Signore de Bonaventura.
I was wondering if...
"Predecessor" implies I have the job.
Unfortunately, I don't, not yet,
though I am hopeful.
They are letting me look after the library,
for a stipend.
The officers who first checked,
didn't find any sort of farewell
or suicide note.
I was wondering if you...
If I happen to come across anything
in the Capponi Library,
stuffed in a drawer or book, yes,
I'll call you at once.
Thank you.
You've been reassigned.
Pardon?
You were on the ll Mostro case,
I'm sure I read.
-Yes, that's right.
-Now you're on this.
This is much less grand a case,
I would think.
Well, if I thought of my work
in those terms,
yes, I guess I'd agree.
-A missing person.
-Sorry?
Were you unfairly dismissed
from the grander case,
or did you deserve it?
Regarding this one, Dr. Fell,
are the signore's personal effects
still at the palazzo?
Mmm-hmm.
Packed neatly in four cases
with an inventory.
Alas, no note.
Well, I'll send someone
over to pick them up.
Thank you for your help.
Hey, thanks.
How's it going? Any leads?
Yeah, they're all leads,
they just don't lead to him.
I don't know how you live with this stuff.
CLARICE: Oh, God.
This is from
The Guinness Book of World Records,
congratulating me on being
"The Female FBI Agent
"Who Has Shot and Killed
the Most People."
Geoffrey, would you excuse me, please?
Sure.
LECTER: Dear Clarice,
I have followed with enthusiasm
the course of your disgrace
and public shaming.
My own never bothered me,
except for the inconvenience
of being incarcerated,
but you may lack perspective.
In our discussions down in the dungeon,
it was apparent to me that your father,
the dead night watchman,
figures largely in your value system.
I think your success in putting an end
to Jame Gumb's career as a couturier,
pleased you most because you could
imagine your father being pleased.
But now, alas,
you're in bad odor with the FBI.
Do you imagine your daddy being shamed
by your disgrace?
Do you see him in his plain pine box
crushed by your failure?
The sorry,
petty end of a promising career?
What is worst
about this humiliation, Clarice?
Is it how your failure
will reflect on your mommy and daddy?
Is your worst fear
that people will now and forever
believe they were, indeed,
just good old trailer-camp,
tornado-bait, white trash,
and that perhaps you are, too?
By the way, I couldn't help noticing
on the FBI's rather dull public website,
that I have been hoisted
from the Bureau's archives
of the common criminal,
and elevated to the more prestigious
Ten Most Wanted list.
Is this coincidence,
or are you back on the case?
If so, goody, goody,
'cause I need to come out of retirement
and return to public life.
I imagine you sitting
in a dark basement room,
bent over papers and computer screens.
Is that accurate?
Please tell me truly,
Special Agent Starling.
Regards, your old pal,
Hannibal Lecter, M.D.
P.S., clearly this new assignment
is not your choice.
Rather, I suppose it is part of the bargain,
but you accepted it, Clarice.
Your job is to craft my doom,
so I am not sure
how well I should wish you,
but I'm sure we'll have a lot of fun.
Ta-ta. "H."
On the letter,
there's one partial fingerprint, here.
Not enough to hold up in court, but...
I know it's him.
Where he was when he wrote it,
is what I need.
Well, the paper isn't gonna help.
And, yes, it's linen fiber,
yes, it's on the expensive side,
but, no, it isn't so rare
that you're not gonna be able to find it
in a thousand different stationery stores
throughout the world.
It's the same with the ink,
and the same with the wax.
And your Las Vegas postmark,
well, you can check it out,
but I'll bet you a dollar
it came from a remailing service.
No, Las Vegas would be the last place
he'd be.
It'd be an assault on his sense of taste.
LECTER ON TAPE: Don't you feel eyes
moving over your body, Clarice?
I hardly see how you couldn't.
And don't your eyes move
over the things you want?
CLARICE ON TAPE: All right, then,
tell me how.
No. It's your turn to tell me, Clarice.
You don't have any more vacations
to sell on Anthrax Island.
Quid pro quo, Clarice.
I tell you things, you tell me things.
Not about this case, about yourself.
Quid pro quo.
Yes or no, Clarice?
Hand cream.
Raw ambergris base.
Tennessee lavender.
Trace of something else.
Fleece.
Lovely.
What's ambergris?
Ambergris is a whale product.
Alas, much as we'd like to,
we can't import it.
Endangered Species Act.
CLARICE: Where isn't it illegal?
Japan, of course.
Couple of places in Europe.
You'd almost certainly find it
somewhere in Paris, Rome, Amsterdam.
Maybe London.
This bouquet was hand-engineered
to someone's specifications.
Is there any way of knowing which shops?
Of course. We'll give you a list.
It'll be short.
I need opera tickets.
I don't think I got any on me.
It's sold out, whatever it's called.
It's the pretty, young wife
with the ever-open beak
who needs opera tickets.
-Benetti.
-What?
-Rewind it.
-I can't rewind it.
I'm making a copy, I'm recording.
What is this?
Security camera from a perfume shop
in Via Della Scala.
FBI through Interpol requested a copy.
-Why?
-They didn't say.
They didn't say?
No. It was actually kind of weird,
like they were making a point not to say.
-Are we going to the opera?
-Yes.
Sorry. Yes, we are going.
You got tickets.
No, but I will.
In fact, I was just about to look here.
Please not the back row.
I would like to see it this time.
Nowhere near the back row,
no matter what the cost.
LECTER ON TAPE: Tell me, Clarice,
wouldn't you want to harm those
who've forced you to consider it, though?
It's perfectly okay to admit it.
It's perfectly au naturel
to want to taste the enemy.
It just feels so good. Tell me, Clarice,
what is your worst memory of childhood?
-KRENDLER: Jesus, Starling!
-Can I help you, Mr. Krendler?
What the hell you doing
sitting there in the dark, Starling?
-Thinking about cannibalism.
-People in Justice are thinking, too.
You know that?
They're thinking,
"What exactly is she doing about Lecter?"
Aren't you curious
why he dines on his victims?
And what's the point of that?
What, are you writing a book,
or you catching a crook?
To show his contempt
for those who exasperate him.
Or sometimes to perform a public service.
In the case of the flutist, Benjamin Raspail,
he did it to improve the sound
of the Baltimore Philharmonic Orchestra,
serving the not-so-talented
flute player's sweetbreads to the Board,
with a nice Montrachet at $700 a bottle.
Well...
That meal began with green oysters
from the Gironde,
followed by the sweetbreads, a sorbet,
and then you can read here in
Gourmet Cuisine,
"A notable dark and glossy ragout,
"the constituents never determined."
I always figured him for a queer.
Why would you say that, Paul?
Oh, all this artsy-fartsy stuff.
Chamber music, tea party food.
Not that I mean anything personal,
if you've got a lot of sympathy
for those people.
What I came here to impress
upon you, Starling,
is I'd better see cooperation.
There are no little fiefdoms here.
I wanna be copied
on every 302, you understand?
Mmm-hmm.
If you work with me,
then your so-called career here
might improve.
If you don't, then all I have to do
is draw a line through your name
rather than under it, and it's over.
Paul, what is it with you?
I told you to go home to your wife.
That was wrong?
Don't flatter yourself, Starling.
That was a long time ago.
Why would I hold that against you, hmm?
And besides, this town is full of corn-pone
country pussy.
That said, I wouldn't mind
having a go with you right now,
if you wanna reconsider.
In the gym, anytime,
no pads.
CLARICE: Is it possible
it went out with the regular mail?
BENETTI: No, I overnighted it to you.
I filled out the slip myself.
This was the day after your request.
I did it right away.
I don't understand what happened.
I think you should have it by now.
I don't. Can you send me another one?
Sure. I will make another copy
especially for you,
Agent Clarice?
Is that right? Can I call you Clarice?
CLARICE: Agent Starling.
I'd appreciate it. What's your name?
Oh, my name is Franco Benetti.
Agent Franco Benetti.
-Well, thank you very much, Agent Benetti.
-Okay.
-So, I'll send you it tomorrow?
-All right.
Bye-bye.
-Nothing, huh?
-Nothing yet.
Still waiting on Florence and London.
MAN ON ANSWERING MACHINE:
The number you have dialed
is not in service at this time.
Please check the...
MAN: Yes? Hello?
I have information about Hannibal Lecter.
Have you shared your information
with the police, sir?
I'm required to encourage you to do so.
Oh.
Is the reward payable
under special circumstances?
May I suggest you contact an attorney
before taking any possibly illegal action?
There is one in Geneva
who is excellent in these matters.
May I give you his toll-free number?
The number is
Thank you for calling.
-MAN: Hello?
-Yes.
I was just speaking with someone...
RECORDED VOICE: There's
a $100,000 advance.
To qualify for the advance,
a fingerprint must be provided,
in situ, on an object
Once the print has been
positively identified,
the balance of the money
will be placed in escrow
at Geneve Credit Suisse,
and may be viewed at any time
subject to 24-hour prior notification.
To repeat the message in French,
press two,
in Spanish, press three,
in German...
Dr. Fell? It's Inspector Pazzi.
Yes, I can see you.
Come on up.
Dr. Fell.
Hello?
Dr. Fell.
Dr. Fell?
Hello?
Snap.
I should have encouraged you
to bring someone along.
The cases, I'm afraid,
are on the heavy side.
Maybe you could help me with them.
Mmm-hmm.
Just down the stairs, I mean.
Yeah. This way.
Here we are.
-Is that the inventory?
-Yes.
May I see it?
Of course.
You are a Pazzi,
of the Pazzi family, I think.
Wasn't it at the Palazzo Vecchio,
your ancestor was hanged?
Francesco de Pazzi?
Yes, thrown naked with a noose
around his neck from a window,
writhing and kicking
alongside the archbishop,
against the cold stone wall.
In fact, I found a very nice rendering of it
here in the library the other day.
If you like,
perhaps I could sneak it out for you.
I would think
that might jeopardize your chances
for permanent appointment
to the curatorship.
Only if you told.
Remind me, what was his crime?
He was accused of killing
Giuliano de' Medici.
Unjustly?
No. No, I don't think so.
Then he wasn't just accused,
he did it, he was guilty.
I think that would make living in Florence
with the name Pazzi, uncomfortable,
even 500 years later.
Not really.
In fact, I can't remember the last time
before today, someone brought it up.
People don't always tell you
what they're thinking.
They just see to it you don't
advance in life.
I'm sorry, Commendatore.
I too often say what I'm thinking.
I'll be right back to help you.
You know, the room you're standing in,
was built in the 15th century.
PAZZI: It's beautiful.
Yes, it is.
Unfortunately, I think the heating system
was installed about the same time.
-That's a pity.
-Yes.
Okey-dokey, let's drag these down.
They must be as heavy as bodies.
WOMAN: And the set?
SALESMAN: 8,000.
Okay.
Hey.
-How much is this?
-50,000.
I'll take it.
Well done.
When you go for his wallet,
he'll catch you by the wrist.
I have done this a few times, Inspector.
Not like this.
If there isn't a clean print on the bracelet,
you'll spend the summer
in a cell at the Sollicciano.
Give me the bracelet.
Wash your fucking hands.
He's coming.
I got it.
He grabbed me just right.
Tried to hit me in the balls,
but he missed.
Let me help you.
No, don't.
WOMAN: 16-point match, Mr. Verger.
Bingo.
-VERGER: Carlo?
-Mason?
Very well. Well.
-Am I coming to see you?
-Yeah, soon, I hope,
but first, I need you to pack off the boys.
-Now?
-Yes, I know.
The day you never thought
would arrive, has.
Now, Cordell will fax the veterinary forms
directly to Animal and Plant Health,
but you need to get the vet
affidavits from Sardinia.
How are they?
They are big, Mason, very big.
Tommaso.
-Say again?
-They are big, Mason, really big.
Maybe 270 kilos.
Oh, wow!
Can you hear?
Hear!
Oh, they sound fantastic.
Oh, super.
The full balance of the money
is payable upon receipt of the doctor alive.
Of course, you won't have
to seize him yourself,
rather, just point him out.
In fact, it's preferable to all concerned,
if that's the extent of your involvement
from this point.
I prefer to stay involved,
to make sure things go right.
Professionals will see to that.
I am a professional.
You enjoy the performance,
Commendatore?
Oh, very much.
Allegra, this is Dr. Fell,
curator of the Capponi Library.
Signora Pazzi. I'm honored.
Are you from America, Doctor?
Not originally. I've traveled there.
I've always wanted to visit,
New England, especially.
I've enjoyed many excellent meals there.
I noticed you wrapped up in the libretto.
Thought this might amuse you.
Dante's first sonnet from La Vita Nuova.
Mmm-hmm.
It's beautiful.
-Rinaldo, look at this.
-Well, yeah, I can see.
"Joyous love, sing to me
"The while he held my heart in his hands
"And in his arms my lady lay asleep
"Wrapped in a veil."
"He woke her then
and trembling and obedient
"She ate that burning heart
out of his hand
"Weeping, I saw him then
depart from me."
Dr. Fell, do you believe a man could
become so obsessed with a woman
from a single encounter?
Could he daily feel
a stab of hunger for her,
and find nourishment
in the very sight of her?
I think so.
Would she see through
the bars of his plight
and ache for him?
Please keep that.
-Oh, I couldn't.
-I insist.
Commendatore.
Allegra.
Ciao.
Goodbye.
-Let's get something to eat.
-Of course.
Why not?
Is that you, Doctor?
Questura. Pandolfini.
CLARICE: I'd like to speak with
Chief Inspector Rinaldo Pazzi, please.
This is Agent Clarice Starling
from the American FBI.
One moment.
Pazzi! FBI.
I'm not here.
Pazzi.
Inspector Pazzi, it's Agent Starling
from the FBI. How do you do?
Actually, I was just leaving for the day.
-Can I call you back tomorrow?
-Oh, this won't take long.
First of all, I'd like to thank you
for sending us the security tape
from the perfume store.
When I say you,
I mean your department, Agent Benetti.
Is he there? Can I speak with him?
-I'm sorry, he's gone home.
-That's all right.
I should tell you this,
rather than him, anyway.
I'm late
for an important appointment.
Well, the person I'm looking for, Inspector,
who was indeed shown on that tape,
is Hannibal Lecter.
-Who?
-Dr. Hannibal Lecter.
-You've never heard of him?
-I'm not familiar.
And the tape confirms that he is,
or was recently, in Florence.
-Really?
-He's a very dangerous man, Inspector.
He's killed 14 people that we know of.
I really have to go, Miss...
Starling. Just another minute.
Are you sure you've never heard of him?
-No, I haven't.
-Because I'm confused.
I'm confused, because someone there
has been accessing our private VICAP files
on Dr. Lecter, with some regularity,
on your computer.
Everybody uses
everybody's computer here.
Maybe one of the detectives on ll Mostro
was looking at profiles of killers...
I'm speaking about the computer
at your home, sir.
You're trying to catch him yourself,
aren't you?
For the reward?
I cannot warn you
strongly enough against that.
He killed three policemen down
in Memphis while in custody,
tearing the face off one of them,
and he will kill you, too.
VERGER: I want him out of Tuscany fast.
Believe me, he'll be gone from
the face of the Earth fast,
feet first.
Because of his avarice,
and his betrayal of the emperor's trust,
Pier Della Vigna was disgraced,
blinded and imprisoned.
Dante's pilgrim finds Pier Della Vigna
on the seventh level of the Inferno.
Like Judas Iscariot, he died by hanging.
So, Judas and Pier Della Vigna
are linked, in Dante,
by the avarice he saw in them.
In fact, avarice and hanging
are linked in the medieval mind.
Now, this is the earliest known
depiction of the crucifixion,
carved on an ivory box in Gaul,
about A.D. 400.
It includes the death by hanging of Judas,
his face upturned to the branch
that suspends him.
Here he is again, on the doors
of the Benevento Cathedral,
this time with his bowels falling out.
Ah, Commendatore Pazzi.
CLARICE: It wasn't easy, but I got this
number. Without telling why, Inspector...
-Sorry.
-Not at all. Welcome.
-Please join us.
-Thank you.
Now, in this plate from the 15th century
edition of the Inferno,
Pier Della Vigna's body
hangs from a bleeding tree.
I will not belabor the obvious parallel
with Judas Iscariot,
but Dante Alighieri
needed no drawn illustration.
It is his genius to make Pier Della Vigna,
now in hell,
speak in strained hisses
and coughing sibilants,
as though he is hanging still.
Avarice, hanging, self-destruction.
"I make my own home
"Be my gallows."
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen,
for your kind attention.
I'm not a scholar,
but I think you've got the job.
Thank you.
-May I buy you a drink?
-How kind of you, I'd like that.
I'll be a minute gathering my things.
Take your time.
Yeah?
Allegra, I'll be home just
a little later than I said.
I'm taking Dr. Fell out for a drink.
Yes.
I can see the people coming out now.
Yes. Bye, honey.
My wife.
LECTER: Oh, I should have
shown them this one.
I can't imagine how I missed it.
Remember? I told you about it.
It's a rendering I found
in the Capponi Library.
Can you make it out?
There's a name there,
the one I told you about.
It's your ancestor, Commendatore,
hanging beneath these very windows,
Francesco de Pazzi.
On a related subject,
I must confess to you,
I'm giving very serious thought
to eating your wife.
If you tell me what I need to know,
Commendatore,
it might be convenient for me
to leave Florence without my meal.
So, I'll ask you the questions,
and then we'll see, all right?
Okay?
So...
Now, was it Mason Verger
you sold me to?
Blink twice for "yes," once for "no."
Was it Mason Verger you sold me to?
Yes. Good. Thank you.
And are his men waiting for me outside?
Was that a single blink?
Oh, you're confused.
Well, please don't be confused,
because I may have to fillet
Signora Pazzi after all.
Have you told anyone
in the Questura about me?
No, I thought not.
Have you told Allegra?
No? Are you sure?
I believe you.
Okey-dokey, here we go.
Okay.
Your heart is really palpitating.
Oh, it's not your heart.
Well, shall I answer it?
CLARICE: I've gone above you.
I've spoken to your section chief.
Someday, you'll thank me, or you won't.
I don't care, you'll be alive.
Inspector Pazzi?
LECTER: Is this Clarice?
Well, hello, Clarice.
I'm afraid I have bad news for you.
Is he dead?
Did you get my note?
I hope you liked the skin cream,
I had it specially made for you.
Is he dead, Dr. Lecter?
Clarice, there is nothing in this world
that I would love
more than to be able to chat with you.
Unfortunately, you've caught me
at an awkward moment.
Please forgive me.
See you around.
An old friend.
Okay, hold on.
Here we go.
I'll go around back.
Cut him! Kill him if you have to!
What's it to be, bowels in, or bowels out?
Like Judas.
Are you confused?
Then I'll decide for you, if you'll permit me.
Carlo!
LECTER: Yes?
Good evening.
Cordell,
to you, does that look like
a wave goodbye,
or hello?
So, what do you think?
Does Lecter wanna fuck her,
or kill her, or eat her, or what?
Probably all three,
though I wouldn't wanna predict
in what order.
Here's what I think.
No matter how Barney
might wanna romanticize it,
or make it "Beauty and the Beast,"
Lecter's object,
as I know from personal experience,
has always been degradation
and suffering.
Cordell, get this damn thing off me,
I can't breathe in this thing.
He comes in the guise of a mentor,
as he did with me, and her,
but it's distress that excites him.
To draw him,
she needs to be distressed.
To make her attractive to him,
let him see her distressed.
Let the damage he sees,
suggest the damage he could do.
When the fox hears the rabbit scream,
he comes a-running,
but not to help.
KRENDLER: I don't understand.
VERGER: Well, there's nothing
to understand, Paul.
All you have to understand
is what it's worth to you.
No, no. I don't understand
why she didn't turn this over.
I mean, she's such a straight arrow.
She didn't turn it over,
because she didn't receive it.
She didn't receive it,
because it was never sent.
It was never sent,
because Lecter didn't write it.
He didn't write it, because I did.
VERGER: So, what do you think?
I think you'd have been better off
if you never got her out of trouble
in the first place.
Woulda, shoulda, coulda.
I meant what do you think
about the money?
Five.
Oh, let's just toss it off, like, "Five."
Let's say it with the respect it deserves.
$500,000.
That's better, but not much.
-And will it work?
-It'll work.
-It won't be pretty.
-What ever is?
Cocksucker.
CLARICE: I've never seen this before
in my life.
KRENDLER: Then how do you account for
its being found in your office?
Your basement?
How do you want me to answer that,
Mr. Krendler?
Let me ask you this. What possible reason
might I have to withhold it?
Well, perhaps because of the nature
of its content.
Reads to me like... Like a love letter.
Has it been tested for prints?
No prints on it. None on the last one.
CLARICE: Handwriting analysis?
KRENDLER: "Did you ever think, Clarice,
"why the Philistines don't understand you?
"It's because you're the answer
to Samson's riddle.
"You are the honey in the lion."
It sounds like him to me.
Do you mean, Mr. Krendler,
like a homosexual?
Like a nut with a crush.
Excuse me, Director Noonan...
NOONAN: Agent Starling,
I am placing you on administrative leave
till document analysis tells me,
unequivocally, a mistake's been made.
In the meantime, you remain eligible
for insurance and medical benefits.
Surrender your weapons
and your identification to Agent Pearsall.
I wanna say something,
I think I'm entitled.
Go ahead.
I think Mr. Mason Verger is trying
to capture Dr. Lecter
for the purposes of personal revenge.
I think
Mr. Krendler is in collusion with him,
and wants the FBI's efforts against
Dr. Lecter to work for Mr. Verger.
I think Mr. Krendler
is being paid to do this.
You're lucky you're not sworn
here today, Starling.
Swear me! You swear, too!
NOONAN: Clarice,
if the evidence is lacking,
you'll be entitled to full reinstatement
without prejudice,
if you don't do or say anything
in the meantime,
that would make that impossible.
NEWSREADER ON TV: Relieved of field duty
pending an internal investigation
into the charges,
Special Agent Clarice Starling,
a 10-year veteran on the Bureau,
began her career with an assignment
to interview lethal madman
Hannibal Lecter.
Earlier today, we heard comments
from Justice Department
spokesman Paul Krendler.
-There he is.
-Krendler! Krendler!
Can you comment on
the Justice Department's
decision at this morning's meeting?
The FBI and the Justice Department
are looking very carefully into the charges,
and, yes, they're extremely serious.
KRENDLER: I'd like to add
a personal note, though.
Starling is one of the best agents
that we have.
No, no, no. Stay. Stay.
Having known her for a number of years,
I would be very surprised
if these accusations turn out to be true.
REPORTER: Is the Justice Department
and the FBI united in this decision?
KRENDLER: Look, it's much too soon
to condemn her.
Good boy.
Ah, and this.
BARNEY ON TAPE: I think she's nice.
She's always been nice to me, polite.
Don't you think?
LECTER ON TAPE: Do you know
what a roller pigeon is, Barney?
Well, roller pigeons climb high and fast,
then roll over and fall
just as fast towards the earth.
There are shallow rollers,
and there are deep rollers.
You can't breed two deep rollers,
or their young, their offspring,
will roll all the way down,
hit, and die.
Agent Starling is a deep roller.
Let's hope one of her parents was not.
Hello?
LECTER: The power in that battery is low,
Clarice.
I would have changed it,
but I didn't wanna wake you.
You're gonna have to use the other one
in the charger.
Hopefully, the light on it is green by now.
Because this is gonna be a long call,
and I can't let you off,
because even though you've been
stripped of your duties,
I know you wouldn't abandon them.
You'll try to put on a trace.
So, we'll disconnect long enough
for you to exchange the battery
in the phone
for the one in the charger.
Shall we say three seconds?
Are you ready?
-Yes.
-Go.
-Very good.
-Thank you.
Remember, Clarice, if you get caught with
a concealed, unlicensed firearm,
in the District of Columbia,
the penalty is pretty stiff.
But bring the guns if you have to.
Now get in your car.
The reason we're doing it like this, Clarice,
is because I like to watch you as we speak,
with your eyes open.
No, it does not excite me, it pleases me.
You have very shapely feet.
Where are we now? Call it out.
-Massachusetts Avenue.
-Take it.
I thought, to begin with,
you might tell me how you're feeling.
About what?
The masters you serve,
and how they've treated you.
Your career, such as it is.
Your life, Clarice.
I thought we might talk about yours.
What's the next cross street?
Capitol Street.
In two blocks,
make a left into Union Station.
Park.
My life? What is there to say about mine?
I have been in a state of hibernation
for some time.
A little inactive, but now I'm back home,
and very happy and very healthy.
You, though, it's you I'm worried about.
I'm fine.
No, you're certainly not fine, Clarice.
You fell in love with the Bureau,
the institution,
only to discover,
after giving it everything you've got,
that it does not love you back.
That, in fact, it resents you.
Resents you more than the husband
and children you gave up to it.
Why is that, do you think?
-Why are you so resented, Clarice?
-Tell me.
Tell you? God bless you.
Well, isn't it clear?
You serve the idea of order, Clarice,
they don't.
You believe in the oath you took,
they don't.
You feel it is your duty
to protect the sheep, they don't.
They don't like you
because you're not like them.
They hate you and they envy you.
They're weak and unruly,
and believe in nothing.
Mason Verger wants to kill you, Dr. Lecter.
Turn yourself in to me,
and I promise no one will hurt you.
Will you stay with me in my
prison cell and hold my hand, Clarice?
We could have some fun.
No, Mason Verger
does not want to kill me,
any more than I want to kill him.
He just wants to see me suffer
in some unimaginable way.
He is rather twisted, you know.
Have you had the pleasure
of meeting him?
CLARICE: I have.
-Face to face, so to speak?
-Yes.
Attractive, isn't he?
Dr. Lecter?
Okay, back to you.
I want to know what it is
you think you will do,
now that everything in the world
you've ever cared about,
-has been taken away from you.
-I don't know, Dr. Lecter.
Tell me, Clarice, do you think you'll work
as a chambermaid at a motel on Route 66,
just like your mommy?
MALE ANNOUNCER: May I have
your attention, please.
Will Mrs. Clark meet
your arriving party at Gate B?
LECTER: What are you thinking now?
Are you paying attention to me,
ex-Special Agent Starling?
Are you, by any chance,
trying to trace my whereabouts?
I'm being followed, Dr. Lecter.
I know, I've seen them.
And now you're in a real dilemma,
aren't you?
Do you continue to try to find me,
knowing that you're leading them to me?
Do you have so much faith
in your abilities, Clarice,
that you honestly believe
you could somehow simultaneously
arrest me and them?
It could get very messy, Clarice,
like the fish market.
-Hey, Clarice.
-Yeah?
-What if I did it for you?
-Did what?
Harmed them, Clarice.
The ones who have harmed you.
What if I made them scream apologies?
No, I shouldn't even say it,
because you'll feel, with your
perfect grasp of right and wrong,
that you were somehow accompli.
Don't help me.
No. Of course not.
Forget I said it.
Piero.
Clarice, you were very, very warm.
You were so close.
And now you're getting colder again.
Yeah, warmer again.
Well, I think I've been generous enough
with you, and the clues.
You're on your own now, Clarice.
Dr. Lecter.
Hope you like them, Clarice. Ta-ta.
Go.
Get out of the way!
I know the first thing an hysteric says is,
"I am not an hysteric,"
but I am not an hysteric. I'm calm.
I'll ask you one time,
think before you answer.
Think about every good thing you ever did.
Think about what you swore.
Two men in a van, a third driving.
Another man down.
They put him in the back.
I think it was Lecter.
I've given you the license plate.
I'm reporting it all to you again,
in front of witnesses.
All right.
I'll go with it as a kidnapping.
I'll send someone out
with the local authorities,
if they'll let us on the property
without a warrant.
I should go, too. You could deputize me.
No. You're not going.
You're going home,
where you'll wait for me to call
and tell you, what, if anything, we found.
Thank Mr. Verger
for letting us look around.
-Sorry if we inconvenienced him.
-Not at all, he's always happy to see you.
Phone.
WOMAN ON PHONE: What number, please?
Carlo.
Give me one.
Hello?
-VERGER: How is he?
-Sleeping.
Bring him home.
CLARICE ON ANSWERING MACHINE:
You've reached Clarice Starling.
Please leave a message.
PEARSALL ON PHONE: Pick up, Starling.
There was nothing out there.
I'm gonna say it again,
in case you didn't hear me clearly before,
you are not a law officer
while you're on suspension.
You're Joe Blow.
I hope for your sake
you're in the bathroom.
VERGER: Hylochoerus
meinertzhageni.
Ring any bells
from high school biology, Doctor?
No?
Well, I could list
its most conspicuous features,
if that will help jog the memory.
Three pairs of incisors,
one pair of elongated canines,
three pairs of molars,
four pairs of premolars, upper and lower,
for a total of 44 teeth.
The meal will begin
with an hors d'oeuvre tartare.
Your feet.
The main course, the rest of you,
won't be served until seven hours later.
But during that time,
you'll be able to enjoy
the effects of the consumed appetizer
with a full-bodied saline drip.
I guess you wish now, you...
You'd fed the rest of me
to the dogs, hmm?
No, Mason.
No, I much prefer you the way you are.
So, dinner at 8:00.
You will stay for
the evening's entertainment,
won't you, Cordell?
If it's all right with you,
I think I'd rather not.
"Rather not"
or "will not"?
Your little brother must smell
almost as bad as you do by now.
Hold it! Hands where I can see them!
Quiet!
What was that?
Cordell, quickly!
Down on your stomach!
Good evening, Clarice. Just like old times.
Shut up.
-Can you walk?
-I can try.
-You look well.
-I'm gonna cut you loose.
If you touch me, I will shoot you.
-Understood.
-Do right, and you'll live through this.
Spoken like a true Protestant.
Better hurry.
This might go faster
if you hand me the knife.
There was a third in the loft.
No, Clarice. Behind me.
Cordell, shoot him!
Get the gun and shoot him!
-Go into the pen?
-Yes.
No. I'm staying out of this.
You're involved, is what you are,
in all of it!
-Now do it!
-No.
Yes!
Hey, Cordell! Why don't you push him in?
You can always say it was me.
Cordell!
Cordell? Cordell!
Cordell!
KRENDLER: Yeah, Mary, it's me.
I decided to take off early.
I'll be at my lake house all weekend.
I don't want any calls
forwarded either, you understand?
Whoever it is, they can all wait, okay?
Mary, listen, it's Fourth of July,
for Christ sakes.
Thank you.
What the fuck?
Good. You brought the wine.
Oh, God!
LECTER: This won't hurt a bit.
OFFICER: We've traced your call,
and units will be there in about 10 minutes.
If you can do it safely,
just get out of the house.
Otherwise, stay on the phone with me.
Ma'am?
Are you there?
Ma'am?
LECTER: We need to make sure
they feel welcome.
KRENDLER: Are those shallots?
LECTER: Mmm-hmm.
And caper berries.
That butter smells wonderful.
You feeling hungry, Paul?
Very.
What's the main course?
You should never ask,
it spoils the surprise.
Clarice, what are you doing up?
You should be resting. Get back to bed.
I'm hungry.
Hello, Paul.
Paul, don't be rude.
Say, "Hello, Agent Starling."
Hello, Agent Starling.
I always wanted to watch you eat.
LECTER: What have you got
in your hand, Clarice?
Something to bash me
over the head with?
Put it on the table.
-Good girl.
-Hey,
-that's mine.
-Now, sit down.
Clarice, love the dress.
It's beautiful.
-What do you think, Paul?
-KRENDLER: Nice.
-Nice.
-Yeah.
Why don't you say grace, Paul?
-Me?
-Yeah.
-Grace?
-Sure.
Okay.
Bow your head.
Father, we thank thee for thy blessings,
and dedicate them to thy mercy,
we are about to receive.
Forgive us all,
even white trash like Starling here,
and bring her into my service. Amen.
You know, I have to tell you, Paul,
even the apostle Paul
couldn't have done better.
He hated women, too.
-May I have some wine, please?
-I don't think that's a good idea, Clarice,
not with the morphine.
I think you should eat some broth. Okay?
By the way, Starling,
that was a job offering
I worked into the blessing.
-I'm going to Congress, you know.
-Are you?
Come around campaign headquarters.
You could be a office girl!
Can you type and file?
Can you take dictation?
Take this down.
Washington is full
of corn-pone country pussy.
I took it down.
You said it already.
Paul, now you're being rude,
and I hate rude people.
Drink your broth like a good boy.
Come on. Sip.
Good.
Well, that's not very good, buddy.
I admit I added something to yours,
perhaps it's clashing with the cumin.
But I assure you,
the next course is to die for.
Come on, Clarice. No. That's a good girl.
Good.
Dr. Lecter.
You see, the brain itself feels no pain,
Clarice, if that concerns you.
For example, Paul won't miss
this little piece here,
which is the part of the prefrontal lobe
which they say is the seat
of good manners.
Your profile at the border stations
has five features.
-I'll trade you.
-"Trade"?
Stop now, and I'll tell you what they are.
How does that word
taste to you, Clarice, hmm?
Cheap and metallic,
like sucking on a greasy coin?
Who's Clarice?
Agent Starling, Paul.
If you can't keep up with the conversation,
better not try to join in at all.
Me, Paul. I'm Starling.
See.
Here...
Right here is the
sac that contains the brain.
I would really like some wine!
That smells great.
Here. Like to try a little piece?
CLARICE: I would really like some wine.
It is good.
LECTER: All right. Just a little.
Okay.
No?
Given the chance,
you would deny me my life, wouldn't you?
Not your life.
My freedom. Just that.
You'd take that from me.
And if you did, would they have you back,
do you think?
The FBI?
Those people you despise
almost as much as they despise you?
Would they give you a medal, Clarice,
do you think?
Would you have it professionally framed,
and hang it on your wall to look at,
and remind you of your courage
and incorruptibility?
All you would need for that,
Clarice, is a mirror.
KRENDLER: I had plans
for that smart mouth,
but I'm never gonna hire her... You now.
LECTER: Paul?
Remember what I said?
If you can't be polite to our guests,
you have to sit at the kiddies' table.
Don't get up, Clarice.
Paul will help me clear,
and make the coffee.
LECTER: Just think about
what I said, Clarice.
Coffee.
I came halfway around the world
to watch you run, Clarice.
Let me run, huh?
Tell me, Clarice,
would you ever say to me,
"Stop. If you loved me, you'd stop"?
Not in a thousand years.
"Not in a thousand years."
That's my girl.
Now, that's really interesting, Clarice.
I'm really pressed for time,
so where's the key?
Where's the key?
Okay.
Above or below the wrist, Clarice?
This is really gonna hurt.
Show me your hands!
Identify yourself!
I'm Clarice Starling!
FBI!
-Hi.
-Hi. What's that?
That's caviar.
What are those?
These are figs.
And that?
And this?
That I don't think you would like.
It looks good.
-Oh, it is good.
-Can I have some?
You're a very unusual boy, aren't you?
-I couldn't eat what they gave me.
-Nor should you.
It isn't even food,
as I understand the definition.
Which is why I always bring my own.
-Hmm.
-Hmm.
So, which would you like to try?
Well, I suppose it's all right.
After all, as your mother tells you,
and my mother certainly told me,
"It is important," she always used to say,
"always to try new things."
Open up.
LECTER: Ta-ta. H.
