Thirty-five years ago,
a gang of bandits...
were caught by the gendarme
on Cudi mountain.
In the course of
these thirty-five years,
illness and prison violence
wiped off all the bandits.
All but one...
Mother Ceran. Is that you?
Yeah. Who are you?
It's Baran.
Baran. The Bandit, you are back?
I'm back Mother Ceran. What
happened to the village?
The water came. Covered everything.
They said ''Go away from here.''
Everyone has deserted the village.
I, alone, stayed here.
I told them not to go.
They wouldn't listen.
Things turned bad after you went
to jail. Evil won the day.
The weak were trampled on.
Where is Mustafa, Ceran?
Left for the city, long time ago...
This place is finished.
Everything's sunk.
Our graves will be next.
Come with me. You'll be
food for the beasts here.
The beasts are of us. Evil is
elsewhere.
I am the madwoman of
this place. I cannot go anywhere.
You're heading for trouble.
I said the same to your father.
I told him ''They'll trap you.''
He wouldn't listen. He went and
didn't come back.
Now if I say ''Don't go!'' You'll go.
I know you will.
Take this, Bandit. It will
protect you from bullets.
Are you going to kill me, Bandit?
Aye Mustafa. I will.
Do you have a gun?
I do.
Give it to me.
Why did you inform on me,
brother Mustafa?
Stupidity, poverty, call it what
you like. This has been killing me.
I can't sleep.
You visit me every night.
I hear your footsteps behind
me. I'm tired of watching my back.
People call me informer. I've lost
face. Even my children shun me.
Why did you do it?
I caved in for a few gold pieces.
Shame on those who forced me.
Who forced you?
I was sworn not to tell, but it
doesn't matter anymore.
Berfo made me do it.
Berfo?
Berfo! He is the one who asked
me to inform on you.
Woe, brother Berfo...
Why did he do it?
To steal Keje from you.
Did Keje go with him?
Yeah. she went with him.
After you went to jail...
Berfo took your gold, then
he went to Keje's father.
I begged him not to. I said ''Keje
is Bandit's girl. Spare her at least.''
He said, ''Fool! I did it all for Keje.''
He took the gold and Keje,
and he disappeared.
Then we heard
he went to Istanbul.
So, this is the thirty year story.
So Keje went with him.
Her father made her go.
She became Berfo's.
We put you in jail. I made a
mistake. I was starved.
Still I'm starved brother.
Bad luck, that gold was.
All went to women and gambling,
All of it.
Our village was covered with dam
water. Everyone was scattered around.
No-one knows who is where.
I'm groveling here as you see.
Anyway, thank god it will all end
now. Come on, finish it off.
Bandit... Bandit.
I can't wait any
longer. Kill me...
Bandit! ....
Greetings.
Hello.
Here. You smoke?
Have one of these, uncle.
No... Please.
please take one of these.
Where are you heading, uncle?
Istanbul, God willing.
Yeah, you're the only one missing
anyway.
Oh my God! Shit! The police.
What shall I do now?..
Bring this bag to
Kismet Garage in Tarlabas i.
Bring this to Kismet Garage
Car mechanic's.
For God's sake!
Please... It's life or death
uncle. I'm begging you please.
I'll pay you a lot.
Please do it man!
-Stop! Police.
-What is this, man?..
Shut up! Cut it out! Go on!
Just a moment. There's a mistake.
What's the charge?
Come on brother.
Where are you taking me man?
I'm off the train, nicely going
home.
Excuse me, can I ask something?
What have I done now?
Clean?
Clean.
He's clean, inspector.
Come on, talk man!
Talk what brother?
You! Did you sell us out, you?
No! I swear. There's no such
thing brother Demircan.
How can you give the stuff costing
billions to just anyone in the street?
The police surrounded me.
Honestly, I swear...
I wasn't afraid of getting caught.
It was for the stuff.
Or? Are you a police mole?
What are you saying brother? That's
the guy's suitcase over there.
What did we do? Didn't we send out
two couriers and tipped...
the cops on
on the wrong one?
How come the cops didn't go after
the decoy then? And got you?
This was only your first job. Talk!
Are you an informer? Say it!
Bring him in.
Forgive me brother.
I had trouble finding the place.
That's him! That's the guy!
It is my first time in Istanbul.
Okay. The stuff is here.
Wow! That was a close one.
What's happened to this thing?
It had an accident. I'm sorry.
Here. It was a promise. Buy
yourself new suitcase.
No. I don't want it.
Take it. You have no idea what you
saved me from. Thanks.
Wasn't trouble at all.
Almost had it man. Yours truly
almost would've had it.
Huh?
Nevermind. Okay. Thanks
I'll be off now uncle if it's okay
with you.
What are you doing?
Just looking.
What at?
Where am I now?
Tarlabas i.
Well... Okay.
Where will you go now?
I don't know really. I'm looking
for a place to stay.
A hotel?
Right, friend. Some place
cheap you know.
Ah! Okay. Come with me.
God bless you, brother.
I felt a little strange you know.
Come with me, uncle. Don't worry.
I did it four times.
Big deal.
Cut the crap you two.
You should never trust a woman.
They always cocktease.
-How did it go?
-It was taken care of.
-Is the job done?
-What job?
Are you still there?
Just a minute uncle, wait for me.
How you doing?
Welcome back. Did you take care
of your business?
Yeah. Why the long face?
I got news from my brother.
He's really in a squeeze.
Well. Prison is a tough place.
Emel! Who are you talking to?
Just friends, come on mom.
Okay, see you then.
Get in! What friends at this
hour? Come help me.
You are a slut.
There is whore in you.
The place is coming down again.
The witch's lost it.
This guy is waiting for you.
-Who's this?
-Just a poor old soul.
Where are you taking him?
To my hotel. He has nowhere to stay.
Wait for me.
-Who did he say he was?
-His grandpa.
-No? He's still alive?
-Lay off Avarel, you're a moron.
Cheapest hotel in Tarlabas i.
Girl Naci will do us a favour.
Naci, you got a room?
What do you want it for?
I'm going to stick it up
you know where.
I'll headbutt your face in,
then you'll see.
-Say it girl, got a room?
-Yes Master Cumali, at your service.
Give a room for uncle here.
Who's this guy anyway?
How do I know he'll pay?
Actor Kemal still owes me
a month's rent.
You're having your period or
something?
Give him the room,
don't drive me crazy.
-ID?
-What?
Hakan... What's up kid?
Come here, I'll kill you. I told
him I'm not buying the mintendo thing.
Bastard spat at me.
Comehere!
Come on uncle Kemal have some water
or something.
I'll be alright now.
Alright? You're getting worse every
day.
You've got to see a doctor.
You haven't been around lately.
I took care of some business.
That's my boy.
It is worst when it starts
during shooting.
The other day-what am I saying-six
months ago, I was playing a small part.
I began coughing, it wouldn't
go away.
Finally, they kicked me out.
Didn't pay me, either.
I hate the communists but in those
days these things were better in Russia.
If you fell ill, they
took you straight to hospital.
This would never have happened.
Especially to an artist like you.
Still, those reds. They ruined
my country.
Don't start again Andrei Mishkin.
All that's over now.
You know, you got me out of a
difficult situation there.
Not at all.
Your binoculars puzzled the cops.
I said I was peeping around.
Why do you
carry them around anyway?
Well. It is a keepsake.
You live in this hotel?
Yeah.
Why? Don't you have a family?
A home?
No. It's better this way.
Why are you in Istanbul uncle?
I am looking for somebody.
Where is that somebody?
I don't know...
What do you mean
''I don't know''?
I don't know where he is.
How are you going to find him
in this huge city?
I will.
Uncle, ten million people
live in this city.
I will look at all ten million
faces if I have to.
When did you last see
this somebody?
Thirty, thirty five years ago.
And you're going to look for
someone you haven't seen for...
...thirty five years
in a city like Istanbul?
You're out of your mind!
Is she looking?
She is. You got her Cimbom.
What is this? You get mushy the
moment you see the girls.
Are we going out tonight?
We got to do some work first.
We're all broke.
Look at the legs on that Fatma.
I'm not going to spend the rest of
my life stealing car stereos.
Wish we could break into Demircan's
lot. He is close to Mafia.
I risked my life for Demircan's job
while you were sitting...
...on your
backs, you faggots.
Cumali, watch your language man.
Fuck off smart ass! So what?
I'm crazy for this Fatma.
What are you staring at you bums?
She's taking you for a ride, idiot.
What? Stupid!
Isn't this him?
What's up?
Well. You know... Nothing.
You're going to look for
your man?
For God's sake, you'll get lost
uncle!
Really? We'll see.
In Istanbul? I don't believe it.
Idiot! Go get lost.
I'll come along with you today. Just
in case. This city could swallow a man.
God bless you. So many people,
so crowded.
Just like the ward
I was in.
Now. Who are we looking for?
Keje.
And where are we headed if we
don't know where she is?
I don't know.
So, Why do we go this way
and not that way?
I don't know. Don't keep asking
questions. I'm only trying to hear...
...the sound of this place.
Don't distract me. Just walk.
We're crazy to be walking
like this. Someone called Keje.
Address: Istanbul.
My feet hurt. This can't go on.
You go back if you want.
What if you get lost?
Displaying your wares again, eh?
You go to the hotel.
I'll be along.
Who's that?
He's the guy who helped me.
Got me walking all day.
Come inside. I'll ask you something.
-What happened to the thing?
-What thing baby?
You were going to take me to see
my brother in prison.
-Anything for you.
-Tomorrow's the open visit.
-Okay, we'll go.
-Mom will kill me if she finds out.
Don't let mom find out about the
prison. She hates my brother.
Come on. Give us a hug.
My dear Kemal Bey.
It's been three months.
I can only bow in humiliation
Naci Bey brother.
I can't wait till you get a part.
This is your last week.
Besides, this coughing of yours.
It's just too much.
I know. Even the syrups don't
soothe it anymore.
All the guests are complaining.
The whole building is shaking.
Any messages for me?
Sure, the mayor called.
He is upset you haven't called.
Fuck off! I'm going out.
The police!
If they ask I'm not here.
If the police find this on me,
I'm fucked. They're already after me.
Why are you armed?
Do you have enemies?
In Istanbul, everyone is your
enemy.
You never know what will
happen next.
See how it shines. Fourteen bullets
at a time. We stole it.
Common property of the gang.
What is this place?
Istanbul.
Istanbul!
Where else?
Istanbul! It looks like where I
live. There are plains...
mountains and towns.
As if I'm on top of Cudi.
How are you?
Fine. I miss you badly though.
Me too, sweetheart.
How's Mom?
God damn her.
Shut up! Cut it out!
Is this him?
Cumali. My brother.
Hello Cumali brother.
Hello brother Sedat. May God
spare you. How are you?
Not too well.
Something wrong?
Yes. Got mixed up in something
here. The top guys passed my...
sentence. They'll stab me.
Sedat!
Shut up! I've got to escape chief.
If I make it to the medical centre,
then I'll escape from the hospital.
But you need to bribe people to get
to the medical centre.
How much?
Two hundred million.
Wow!
Anyway, forget it now.
You're okay?
I'm not.
You take care of this girl chief.
She is your responsibility.
If anything happens to her I will
get out of my grave, and find you.
They will kill him.
How can he get this kind of money?
The money will be found.
Who will find it?
Two hundred million isn't nothing.
I will find it.
No. How can you shoulder such a
burden?
Your brother is
my brother.
Cumali! My hero.
What are you doing here?
Looking around.
What is that in your hand?
Binoculars.
You've no shame? Peeping on
people's wives and daughters.
No, I wouldn't...
I am looking for someone.
With binoculars?
Aye, How else could I see him?
Go away, man.
I have to find two hundred million.
You're kidding?
-Where the hell is he?
-This is for you, from Sekine.
-Where is mine, baby?
-Idiot!
Go inside.
And you go home too.
He must have lost his way.
Who?
That guy, the one in the hotel.
Why do you hang around
with that peasant?
Watch your language! He is
old enough to be your father.
This is how I talk to my father.
Hey! Hakan. Where's your mom?
She's out working.
So she went out early today. Naci, girl,
are you sure you didn't see uncle?
I told you I didn't.
You sure get obsessed about things.
The guy's got lost.
I shouldn't have let him go alone.
Where have you been, uncle?
We were all worried about you.
-We thought you were lost.
-I was lost, brother.
Great! So how did you
find your way back?..
The old way. I trailed my way back.
This city is a prison Cumali.
I can't breathe in this city.
It stinks like rotten carcass.
The wards used to smell like this.
Here, I brought you candies.
What's that?
Binoculars.
-Can I have a look?
-Sure.
Who uses this?
The gendarme, army officers,
and once... The bandits.
What is a bandit?
A brigand, a robber.
Living on mountains.
Just a human being like you
and me.
You know any bandits?
I know one. He was called Baran.
The clan chief sent Baran's father...
...to the mined border and had
him killed.
And Baran rebelled and took to the
mountains.
Baran is very young then. He is in
love with a girl. And a terrific shot.
It was a mighty mountain like
that one.
He fought the clan chief's
bandits at that time.
He picked them out with these binoculars
and gave them the bullet.
Are you that Baran?
Yes. I am.
Hakan. To your room, quick!
It is bed time.
Come on, Cumali.
Shut up. Give me the binoculars
Off you go.
Are you a bandit?
It was thirty five years ago.
Wow! Our uncle, a bandit!
So, what have you done
all these thirty five years?
I was in jail.
What? For thirty five years?
Thirty five years.
That's enough to kill a man.
It did kill all my friends.
Look, here.
How come you weren't pardoned?
I killed three more in prison.
What?
They sent hired men on me.
I finished them off.
You were talking about a
sweetheart. Is that Keje?
Aye.
You're looking for her?
Keje and the man who abducted Keje.
The first film about the Southeastern
problem will soon be released.
The film is expected to boldly take up
the greatest problem of this country.
In other news. The attempt on
business tycoon Mahmut Saho%lu's
life is under investigation.
The police have not yet made a
public statement. In the meantime,
Saho%lu remains silent.
The elusive Saho%lu is the owner of
an empire that has extraordinarily
grown to the size of thirty
companies in the last twenty years
and has reached everywhere like the
tentacles of an octopus.
He recently gave his only TV
interview to date to Mithat Bereket.
Mahmut Bey, you have become the
centre of attention with your
outbursts against the Industrialists'
Association and the government.
Yes!
In fact, there are various
unpleasant allegations about your
own wealth. You accuse the
Association of illegal practices,
but you cannot explain how you grew
so powerful in a matter of twenty years?
You are also accused of loansharking
and of seizing businesses with
Mafia assistance.Your textile factory
is shown as an example.
There are also allegations
that granting of your bankers'
licence is somewhat questionable.
-Who sent you here?
Excuse me?
You! Who pays you? How dare you
present rumours as the truth?
Please watch your tone. You can't
talk to me like that.
Go send me your boss...
You won't pull me down, ever!
-I am a journalist.
-You are a hired pen!
No, I am an independent journalist.
I employ a hundred people like
you. Go tell those who mess with me
they can't tear me down. They
don't have what it takes.
Get out of my house! Get out!
Turn the damn thing off. Cut!
I found you.
What does it say?
Come on, tell us.
I'm not saying!
Say it and I'll treat you to a
whore.
Fuck off then, don't!
-You're going to talk, or not?
-Cumali, don't!
-It could go off, man.
-Speak up, what did she write?
Brother Cumali, come help me.
What is it? What happened?
Come to the hotel. I'll show you
someone. I saw him. On TV.
I'll be right back. You guys stay
put. We'll be on a job tonight.
Yeah, you put the kid to bed.
Make sure he drinks his milk.
Did you wet yourself?
He was here?
Who?
Berfo! In a wheelchair.
Tubes up his nose.
Where is he? Where has he gone?
Who are you talking about, man?..
He means Mahmut Saho%lu.
Mahmut Saho%lu? You know him?
Take me to him.
Why did you bring this geezer?
Hush! He'll hear.
He is an old bandit.
-What?
-A bandit!
Meaning what?
You know, a bandit. On the
mountains. A highwayman.
You sure he didn't make it up?
I saw the photo. He snuffed three
people in prison.
Imagine what he
must have done in the mountains.
Run for it!
Hey, Bandit, come on!
Will you find him for me?
Take me to him
Give me a break, for God's sake.
God damn it.
We're just drifting bums.
Every job should have some
respectability. Look at us.
As they say: Live fast, die young
and you'll leave a handsome corpse.
Let me tell you something. Only way
to play this game is to play it big
When my father migrated to
Istanbul, he got a job as a waiter.
That's where he lost the game
I've been a mechanic, a bouncer
at clubs, parked cars.
Still I am a nobody.
I went to jail for nothing.
We're all the same.
The other day, I quarreled with my
dad, He wants me to go back to my...
job at the factory. I said no.
You're a worker and look where it
got us. He went mad.
We should all move out like Cumali.
I will go to brother Demircan. I'll
say: Rescue us from this life.
Get us on your team.
We'd be like royalty round here.
We'll get respect, man.
Everyone will look up to us,
shop owners etc. The girls.
Maybe I shouldn't come.
Sure! Left to yourself, you'd
get lost again. Stick to me
Just a minute, uncle.
Beg your pardon?
The week is over. You owe me.
Put him on my bill.
-But, Cumali...
-Shut up or I'll clobber you.
I have friends, I have partners I am
responsible to. I have to be careful.
Now, you almost sank us on that job
the other day. Still, you didn't
talk to the police, you're okay. I
know that.
Our business is no kids' play,
amateurs fail.
So last time, you begged and prayed
and I let you have your chance.
What will you say for yourself
this time Cumali?
This time we are here to put
ourselves entirely at your command.
I and my friends are solid, brother
Demircan.
Order us to die and we will.
And we know our way around.
You can't find better men to deal
the stuff.
There isn't a club we don't know.
Give us just one chance,
then decide.
Okay, we'll give it a try. Not a
word to anyone about this though.
And stay out of the
police's way.
If you get caught
I don't know you.
And this uncle over there, is he
part of your gang?
No. He's a bandit.
A real bandit. A mountain man.
That's of course, back when.
No bandits left on the mountains,
uncle.
Now, all the bandits are
down in the city.
I have important news for you.
Come inside, mom's out.
Sekine, when will you put out?
Cimbom's all horny.
God damn you, asshole!
Didn't I tell you not to wear
mini-skirts?
Mom first, now you start.
You jealous pig!
What is it?
We have a deal with brother
Demircan.
We'll push some of
the stuff for him.
So, it means we're finding money.
Don't look at my face like an idiot.
I'll be able to save your
brother.
Thank god!
My hero!
Don't. Mom will be
back any minute now.
Come on girl, give it to me.
We'll be married anyway.
Not before the wedding,
Shit! It's mom.
What shall we do? Let's pretend we
are just talking.
No! To the window...
Keje...
Keje...
Keje...
We almost got nailed there.
This is not the right way to go.
What's wrong with way?
Drugs are bad news. Don't do it.
You are poisoning people.
I've known many dealers in prison.
They all ended up badly.
''Don't do it'', eh? What should I do
then? Is theft better?
Or conning people?
Which one is better?
None. None of that is fitting for
human beings.
All of that is fitting for human
beings.
Or they wouldn't be around.
Why did you do it then?
You know why my dad named me Cumali?
My father adored Yilmaz Güney.
He named me after one of Güney's
screen characters.
He saw ''Ince Cumali''
fifteen times.
In everyday life my father imitated
Yilmaz Güney.
Walked and talked like him.
Looked a bit like him too.
My stepmother betrayed
him. Can you imagine?
A betrayed hero!
He shot them both. My stepmother
was crippled and the guy died.
So that's what my father got for
being a good guy.
I mean, anything can happen in
life.
Besides, I don't like doing this. But
Emel needs the money for her brother.
Back in jail, we knew two Kemals,
Mustafa Kemal and Dodo Kemal.
Dodo Kemal was a very young
convict. A murderer.
Every morning, he used to get the
papers first. He used to go through...
the pages like crazy, looking for
news of an amnesty.
After years of this, he did receive
his pardon and was freed.
A week later, he had murdered
someone and was back in jail.
You remind me of him. If I had
a son, he would be your age.
And if my father were alive, he
would be your age, Bandit.
Will you take me to him, brother.
Who?
The man on the TV.
Take me to him.
That's all I ask of you.
This is my request.
Is this the place?
Yes. This is it.
Are you sure?
Don't drive me nuts Bandit.
You said ''take me'', and I did.
This guy is one of the richest guys
in Turkey.
What is your business
with him uncle?
Look, I'm leaving. Can you find
your way back to the hotel?
You saw what you wanted to see.
The car's gone too. Let's go now.
Who are you looking for, man. Why
should I care anyway?
I don't own you.
I'm leaving.
Hey! What's going on? Just a
minute. Where are you taking us?
Didn't I tell you ''Let's go''
It is my fault. I should have left.
Get lost if you want. Am I your mom
or your dad? You're a grown man.
Get me out of here!
Get me out!
I'll break down the door.
Get me out of here!
Stop it Bandit! Are you out of your
mind? Don't!
What were you doing there?..
Were you there to kill Mahmut Bey?
No. I don't have a gun.
Why were you watching the place?
You're an ex-convict.
Are you a hitman?
No such thing.
Sir, there's a call for you sir.
Sir, please let me explain, you see,
this poor old guy is penniless.
We were looking for a job for
him when we saw that mansion.
We thought they might be hiring
a gardener or something.
We are not terrorists or anything.
We are your decent, honest...
one hundred percent Turkish,
sort of people.
Cut it out! Get out of here,
both of you.
See, my spiel worked. The guys
thought we were terrorists.
You're not going to
that house again, understand?
Hello.
Hello brother.
You are coming with us.
Where are you going?
Who are you?
You are not coming. Just him.
