Hey, can I get another drink
down here?
I've been to prison once.
I've been married twice.
I was once drafted by
Lyndon Johnson and had to live
in shit-ass Mexico for two
and a half years for no reason.
I've had my eye socket
punched in, a kidney taken out,
and I got a bone chip in my
ankle that's never gonna heal.
I've seen some pretty shitty
situations in my life.
But nothing has ever sucked
more ass than this.
If I'd known I was gonna have to
put up with screaming brats
pissing on my lap for 30 days
out of the year,
I would have killed myself
a long time ago.
Come to think of it,
I still might.
Where I come from,
we didn't celebrate Christmas.
Not because we were Jewish,
but because my dad
was a worthless-coward fucking
asshole whose idea of a present
was a daily punch
to the back of the head.
He did teach me
how to crack a safe, though.
My dad never did shit with his
life, so he took it out on me.
You could say I'm no different.
I'd have to say you were right.
But at this point,
it's too late to start over.
Funny how things work out.
It's fucking hilarious.
There's Santa Claus.
Look there.
Wow.
Oh, my.
What a darling photo.
Are you certain you only want
the single?
Additional photos come in handy
as gifts for Grandma and Grandpa
or as a wonderful remembrance
for friends.
Gee.
You know what?
This one, I think it's more
than enough.
Thanks.
Merry Christmas.
So, what do you want,
little girl?
A drum set.
Oh, the old man will love that.
Okay. Fine.
See you later.
I saw you at another mall.
Well, I'm very happy for you.
You're not really Santa.
If you were Santa,
you could do magic.
You want to see some magic?
Here.
Let's watch you disappear.
Watch the bladder, kid.
Santa's got to pee.
- What do you want?
- A new bike.
Wow. That's a new one.
Excellent.
Attention, shoppers.
The store will be closing
in five minutes.
We hope tomorrow is
a pleasant Christmas.
Thank you for shopping with us.
- Is that it?
- Yeah, that's the last one.
Thank the fuck Christ.
Jesus, Mother Mary, and Joseph.
You pissed yourself.
Aw, Jesus.
Yeah, all right.
Yeah.
Hey, happy holidays.
All right.
Merry Christmas.
Happy holidays.
Get home safe.
Yeah, okay.
I don't care what he says.
- We're going out for a beer.
- What the fuck?
I'll get right back to you.
What the hell's wrong with you?
I'm trying to fucking leave.
Pants are awful baggy.
You got anything in there?
Yeah. My dick.
You want to see it?
Keep pushing me.
I got my eyes on you.
All the time.
Ready.
Jesus.
- How's it going?
- I'm finished when I'm finished.
I'm going back upstairs.
I need a melon baller
and a loofah.
Got it.
Fuck the loofah.
Let's go.
Marcus, you get the loofah?
Drive.
Oh!
Oh, I'm dizzy.
Put me down.
Hey, put me down.
Come on!
Put me down.
Oh, come on.
Oh, man.
Hey, baby, two more of these,
all right?
No.
That's it for me.
You can't drink worth a shit,
you know that?
I weigh 92 pounds, you dick.
Come on. One more.
It's a celebration.
Here's to you.
You're getting worse,
you know that?
Well, at least I got it open.
It took you long enough.
I remember when you could unlock
a lock like it was nothing.
Yeah, well, you don't have to
worry about me anymore.
I'm out.
Bullshit.
Bullshit, my ass.
We just made $ 111,000
in one night.
Exactly. I figure I got enough
to go to Miami.
And do what?
I don't know. Shit.
Get a car.
Get a place, maybe.
Maybe start a business.
A bar out on the beach.
Something like that.
I could quit drinking
and run the place.
Maybe marry a waitress.
What?
You ain't gonna do shit
except go down there
and drink your fucking ass off.
You're gonna piss
everything away
and end up counting the days
till next Christmas.
You'd like that, wouldn't you?
Well, it ain't gonna happen.
If I call you next December...
if I call you next December...
you're gonna be so happy
to hear from me
you're gonna do
a goddamn backflip.
You're gonna put
that Santa hat on so fast
that you're gonna get
fucking hat-burn.
Can I get you guys two more?
No, thanks.
We're all right.
See?
I'm already on the wagon.
Hey. Asshole!
How many times
I got to tell you?
Get out from behind my bar!
Put the drink down right now.
Put the drink down right now!
Ahh.
Fuck you.
- Fuck me, huh?
- Right.
Oh. Hey!
Ow!
Get the fuck out of my bar.
Fuck you!
You're fucking crazy.
Fucking prick.
Asshole!
Get the fuck out of here
right now!
Fucking shit!
Fuck you!
Fuck you!
Fuck you!
Yeah, baby.
Hey, Tiffany, you want to play
"Hide the Nazi" one day?
God damn it.
Here you go, sweetie.
I got something
for your pretty ass.
- You do?
- Yeah.
Wow. $5.
Thanks.
I gotta listen to my messages,
and you need to take a shower.
I'm a dancer.
I sweat.
Yeah, well, you smell like
a bum's nut sac.
Fuck you.
Message one.
Mr. Soke?
This is Andrew Kaplan again,
from the collection agency.
Message two.
This is Dolores Axelrod.
You ran into my car last week.
I called State Farm,
but they have no record
of any insurance policy for you.
In case you misplaced it,
my phone number is 4...
Message three.
Willie, it's Marcus.
It's that time of year again.
Pack your shit.
Phoenix.
Jesus Christ!
Can you maybe keep it together
for just 10 minutes?
Harrison, just let me explain,
please. Financially...
Well, you get what you paid for,
Chipeska.
Five Christmases I've been here.
You flip me for some stranger
who'll do it for peanuts
and who happens to work
with a real midget.
Nobody cares.
Nobody comes here for the elf.
Santa's the attraction.
I do Burl Ives songs.
Does this schmo
even play guitar?
Look, Harrison, it's not about
the money or the midget.
Believe me, if it was, I...
I don't think they like
"midget."
I think you're supposed to
call them...
Oh, just forget it.
Hacks!
Hi.
Bob Chipeska.
Welcome.
Great photo and résumé,
by the way.
Thanks.
We've been at this
a long time and all.
We'd like to think we do
a good job.
I'm so glad you guys could
come in on such short notice.
I must say,
your look is just sensational.
Thanks.
We've been at this for years.
You got nothing to worry about.
You two are the best men
for this job, truly.
So don't let his unpleasantness
affect your performance.
- Oh, no. We're fine.
- Performance?
Yes. Uh, your performance.
You know, the, um...
Performance, like sexual?
- Excuse me?
- Willie.
Are you saying there's
something wrong with my gear?
Is that what you're saying?
- I'm sorry. Your gear?
- Willie.
My fuck stick.
Hey, Willie.
Take a seat.
You know how
your blood sugar is.
He's not going to say "fuck
stick" in front of the children?
No, no, no.
It's a joke.
An adult joke for us adults.
It's a joke.
Just a joke.
"Fuck stick"?
Yes. I thought it was
very strange, too.
So, as our security chief,
I wanted you to be aware.
But his little friend promised
he wouldn't say it
in front of the children,
which is fine.
Because, you know,
there is an adult world
and a child's world,
and that's okay.
I'm no censor.
"Little friend"?
Yes, he happens to be a dwarf.
Or midget.
I don't know
what he's called exactly.
But, uh, he's a little guy.
Little Billy Barty.
God rest.
But thin fingers.
Not the fat sausage fingers.
"Little people."
That's what they like.
Yes. Uh, right.
Little people.
So "fuck stick."
That's it?
Yeah.
Merry Christmas!
Santa's coming. Yay!
Merry Christmas!
Santa's coming. Yay!
Merry Christmas!
Have you seen that new Santa
they just hired?
Yeah.
He's back there drunk.
He's coming, guys.
Santa will be here real soon.
God damn it!
What the fuck you doing?
You blow this, and we're broke.
So stop acting
like you know something.
'Cause, pal of mine,
you don't know squat!
Now, put on your hat
and get out there.
And try to act professional,
for Christ's sakes.
What do you want?
What?
Get out of here.
Next.
Next.
Oh, good.
What do you want?
What do you want?
What are you doing?
God damn it!
Nintendo Deer Hunter 3.
I don't give a shit
what you want.
Blowing snot all over everybody
and fucking whatever.
Next.
Come on.
What do you want?
- Um, Santa?
- Yeah, I'm Santa.
Come on.
What do you want?
- Um, Barbie.
- Say cheese.
Okay. Fine.
Barbie.
Oh, thank you.
Ow! Watch the toenails, kid!
Shit.
Next.
Next!
What do you want?
Fraggle-Stick car.
What the fuck is that?
Fraggle-Stick car.
Well, I heard you.
Fraggle-Stick car. Fine.
Hey, check out this loser.
Hey, fat-ass.
How you doing today?
Hey, loser.
Hey, dipshit.
Moron.
Hey, loser.
How you doing today?
Dumb-ass,
why don't you turn around?
You know what?
Fuck this.
You're next.
Next.
I said next, God damn it.
This is not the DMV, all right?
Move it along.
What's your name?
You can tell me.
I know.
How about Santa?
If you don't tell him,
you won't get a present.
That's right.
Come on and tell Santa
all about it.
What do you want?
Well, come on.
What do you want?
A snot-rag?
Great.
Another fucking Mongoloid.
Marcus, get this kid off me
before he pisses on me.
Don't fuck with my beard.
It's not real.
No shit.
Well, it was real.
But, you see, I got sick
and all the hair fell out.
How did you get sick?
I loved a woman
who wasn't clean.
Mrs. Santa?
No.
It was her sister.
What's it like
at the North Pole?
Like the suburbs.
Which one?
Apache Junction.
What the fuck do you care?
Now, get off my lap.
You sit there
like a fucking retard.
You are really Santa, right?
No.
I'm an accountant.
I wear this fucking thing as
a fashion statement, all right?
Okay.
Get this kid out of here.
He's freaking me out.
I got to get a drink on.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Just don't come into work
stinking of booze again.
Yeah.
Why don't you get going?
You'll be late for your
"Wizard of Oz" Candy Bar Guild.
Lollipop Guild, you asshole.
Jesus!
Two-year-olds flip me shit
better than you.
You saying something to me?
Yeah. I'm gonna stick
my whole fist up your ass.
What?
Mmm.
Another Grand-Dad, Santa?
Yeah.
Yeah?
Got a name?
Yeah.
So, what do you do, you know...
After the holidays, I mean.
Well, nothing till March,
and then I'm the Easter Bunny.
Oh. Another?
Yeah. Why not?
Merry Christmas.
Not a big talker.
No, not really.
- Buy you one?
- Why not?
Happy New Year.
You're pretty regular
for a Santa.
It's not that big
a fucking deal.
It's just a job,
you know what I mean?
I'm an eating, drinking,
shitting, fucking Santy Claus.
Prove it.
Fuck me, Santa.
Fuck me, Santa.
Fuck me, Santa. Fuck me, Santa.
Fuck me, Santa. Fuck me, Santa.
Fuck me, Santa.
Fuck me, Santa!
Can't I at least take
this hat off?
No. I love the hat.
Okay.
Whoo!
I've always had a thing
for Santa Claus.
In case you didn't notice.
It's like some deep-seated
childhood thing.
So is my thing for tits.
Yeah.
It is like that, though.
From when you're a kid.
'Cause my dad was Jewish,
and we didn't have Christmas.
So it was like
this forbidden thing.
So...
I like you.
Don't mothball that suit.
What the fuck?
I am not gay.
- What the hell, buddy?
- Buddy?
I said I am not gay.
Are you off your fucking meds
or something?
Yes.
But that isn't
what this is about.
You're as queer as a $ 10 bill.
Let me tell you something,
motherfucker.
My brother lost a goddamn arm
fighting you fuckers in Vietnam.
So I want you to look at my face
one last fucking time.
This is the last thing you're
ever gonna see before I...
Elf fucker!
- Motherfucker!
- Turn around, elf fucker.
Who's the bitch now,
Santy Claus? Huh?
Faggy Claus!
Faggy!
Leave Santa alone!
Little boy, don't interfere.
I am doing this for all of us.
Leave Santa alone!
Ass clown.
Hey, you're that kid.
What the fuck are you
doing here?
This one fucking time
I take you home, okay?
Uh-huh.
I'm not your fucking dada.
Uh-huh.
It's not like you helped me
with that nutjob or anything.
- Uh-huh.
- You're the right height.
You're right there
to grab his balls.
- You could twist them.
- Why do you need a car?
- What?
- This car.
Which turn is it?
Sage Terrace.
Where's your sleigh?
It's in the shop,
getting repaired.
- Where are the reindeer?
- I stabled them.
Is it left or right?
That way.
Where's the stable?
- Next to the shop.
- How do they sleep?
Who? The reindeer?
Standing up.
But the noise.
How do they sleep?
- What noise?
- From the shop.
They only work during the day,
all right?
I thought it was always night
at the North Pole.
Well, not now.
Right now it's always day.
Then how do they sleep?
- Oh, shit. Sage Terrace.
What is it with you? Somebody
drop you on your fucking head?
On my head?
Are they gonna drop you
on somebody else's head?
How can they drop me
onto my own head?
No, not onto your...
Would...
God damn it!
Are you fucking with me?
Okay.
Which house is it?
That one.
With Jesus and his family
there or what?
No.
The one beside that.
- Right here?
- Yeah. That one.
All right.
Nice digs.
Is Daddy home?
He's on an adventure,
exploring mountains.
He's been gone a long time.
Exploring mountains, huh?
How long is he gonna be gone?
Till next year.
Yeah?
What about Mommy?
She lives in God's house with
Jesus and Mary and the ghost
and the long-eared donkey and
Joseph and the talking walnut.
Well, who the fuck takes care
of you, then?
Grandma.
Yeah?
What's her name?
Grandma.
Is Granny spry?
Everybody!
Grandma? Grandma?
Santa's here.
Oh, Roger.
You're home.
Are you spry?
Let me fix you some sandwiches.
Are you telling me
she's the only one here?
Nobody else?
No aunts or cousins or uncles
or anything like that?
A butler or security guard
or something?
Nuh-unh.
You're shitting me.
Does your daddy have a safe?
Need money to fix your sleigh?
Exactly.
You want milk and cookies?
No.
Should I fix you
some sandwiches?
Unh-unh.
Does your daddy have a car?
Bye, Santa!
Oh, my!
- Keep going.
- Jesus!
Ohh!
Oh, God!
Ooh!
Oh, Zena!
Oh, Mary!
Keep it going.
Jesus Christ!
Yeah, baby.
Yeah, baby.
You ain't gonna
shit right for a week.
Oh!
- Yeah, buddy!
- Yeah!
- Whoo!
It won't happen again.
I can promise you that.
Willie here has low blood sugar.
That's all.
That's right.
I forgot to take my pill.
It's not just the swearing.
Um...
Forgive me for prying.
But did one of you, um...
fornicate...
Fornicate?
Yes, with a heavyset woman
in the Big & Tall dressing room.
Look, I've boned a lot
of fat chicks in my time, sure.
But as far as I can recall,
I've never fornicated anybody.
Yes, well, even still,
I think it's best for
all parties considered if we...
If we what?
Well, I have someone else
interested in the position.
Before you do something stupid,
you may want to think
about this shit.
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about firing
a little black midget.
A colored, African-American
small person.
That's what I'm talking about.
I'm talking about your face
all over goddamn "USA Today."
I'm talking about 150
of these little motherfuckers
all over the sidewalk out there.
Little picket signs,
chanting and raving.
Using little bullhorns
and shit like that.
Screaming and hollering
your name out.
Unfair practices.
Get me?
No. No, no.
This is not a handicap thing.
I have nothing
against you people.
"You people"?
Did you hear that, Marcus?
He said, "You people."
Who the hell is "us people"?
Wait. Wait.
No, no.
I... You don't under...
What?
He...
No, no.
Um, you know, I think it's best
if we just forget we had
this conversation.
Okay.
Good thinking.
And don't worry about us.
We'll be fine.
Let's get the hell
out of here, Marcus.
You're pathetic.
I dig that little thing
on your belly button.
What's that?
Like a diamond?
It's a belly-button ring.
Oh, yeah?
Hang on a second.
Check this out.
You got to thrust.
See what I'm saying?
You gotta move the ball around.
You go up there, baby.
Come on.
See? Move the ball.
There you go.
Motherfucker!
Oh, you lousy, fucking
motherfucker.
That's the shit
that's gonna get us pinched.
She said she was 18.
But you promised no arcades.
You said you'd only hustle
Big & Tall.
You shat me out of your womb?
You're my fucking mom now?
I don't need
any goddamn lectures.
I know how to keep
a low profile. Thank you.
What the fuck is this,
Mr. Low Profile?
Mind your own goddamn business.
Ever hear of
the open bottle law?
A couple of days ago, I was in,
uh, Women's Big & Tall.
And I heard these...
Um, you know, these noises.
And I heard a woman screaming,
"Yeah. Oh, yeah."
And I heard his voice saying,
"That's right.
You ain't going to S-H-l-T
right for a month."
But don't get me wrong.
I was against
the Clinton impeachment.
What a man does
with his own penis...
Oval Office,
Women's Big & Tall...
it's not for
the American people to say.
Yeah, right.
But when you're dealing
with children...
They have a tender sensibility.
And you are in a position
of trust.
I think perhaps someone who has
screaming orgasms
with large women shouldn't...
Yeah.
Of course,
I can't fire him for that.
Oh, yeah.
Unfair practices.
Special pleading.
Bitch, bitch, bitch.
Fucking broads.
But I just can't help it.
There's something about the guy
that makes me uneasy.
Well, sure.
Santa fucking someone
in the ass.
- So...
Maybe there's something
I could fire him for.
Yeah, I get you.
Do you?
Do you think
you could find something?
Shit, yeah.
There's always something.
Shit.
Hey, Opal.
Come here.
Unh-unh.
Screw you, Willie,
your kinky ass.
Last time I didn't shit right
for a week.
No, it's not that.
I need to talk to you.
I'm just tired of you, Willie.
Ooh.
Who the fuck is in my room?
Did you see somebody
go in my room?
Yeah.
Some guy asking about you.
Looked like a cop.
Oh, shit.
Marcus, it's Willie.
I just got back to the motel.
Some guy is nosing around
in my room.
What guy?
You get a look at him?
No.
But I think he's a cop, though.
Think somebody's onto us?
Is there anything in the room?
Anything professional?
No, I just got clothes in there.
Just ditch, you idiot.
You got anywhere to sack out
for a while?
- Santa!
- Yeah.
You're bringing
my present early?
No.
But I never told you
what I wanted.
I said I didn't bring it,
dipshit.
Okay. Good.
I want a stuffed elephant.
A pink one.
Wish in one hand,
shit in the other one.
See which one fills up first.
Okay.
So I'm gonna be staying here
for a while.
Things are all fucked up
at the North Pole.
Mrs. Santa caught me
fucking her sister.
And I'm out on my ass now.
She got half of everything.
This is gonna be cool.
This will do fine.
So I'm gonna be crashing here.
It will be just you and me,
like roommates, you know?
Do you and Mrs. Santa have kids?
No.
Thank the fuck Christ.
What about the elves?
Well, they stay with Mrs. Santa.
I get them on the weekends.
Why don't you go run me a bath?
What about the reindeer?
Would you please shut up
about reindeer?
What are their names?
Who?
The elves.
Oh, shit.
I can't remember.
I think one of them is Sneezy.
There's a Dopey.
That's the Seven Dwarfs.
Oh, you're shitting me.
I thought...
I was thinking it was the...
I don't know.
Fuck, kid.
I just call them, "bub."
I say, "Hey, bub" or "chief"
or whatever the fuck.
I tell him to make
the goddamn toy.
What the fuck is wrong
with you?
I can't remember this shit!
Does everything with you
have to be a fucking test?
How old are they?
You want cookies?
No.
Warm milk?
No.
Should I fix you
some sandwiches?
I don't want
any fucking sandwiches.
What is it with you
and fixing fucking sandwiches?
Okay.
Do you want anything else?
No.
Okay.
Santa?
What?
I brought you some orange juice.
What's in it?
Oranges.
Look what I have.
An Advent calendar.
What the hell is that?
It's the story of Christmas,
but in a calendar.
Every day you peel open
a new box.
You get part of the story.
And then there's
a chocolate inside.
Do you want to open up
today's box and read it?
No.
You go ahead.
Jesus Christ, kid.
Watch the nuts.
"So Joseph went up from
the town of Nazareth in Galilee
to Judea, to Bethlehem,
the town of David.
In those days Caesar Augustus
issued a decree
that a census should be taken
of the entire Roman world.
Everyone went to his hometown
to register."
- That it?
- Yep.
That's an awesome
fucking story, kid.
There's more to it, but we
have to wait till tomorrow.
Do you want to eat
the chocolate?
You go ahead.
Are you coming downstairs?
I'll be down in a minute.
I got to go to work.
Fuck me?
Fuck you.
You can't just take up
with some kid.
You don't know who's around
or what they do.
You got some nerve,
you little shit, you.
What, you're my mom now?
You shat me out of your womb?
You said that yesterday,
you stupid fuck.
Shit.
Fuck you.
You are by far the dumbest,
most pathetic piece
of maggot-eating shit
that has ever slid
from a human being's hairy ass.
What if the kid has one of those
fucking playdates they have now?
Are you shitting me?
The kid don't have any friends.
He don't even have an imaginary
friend unless he ditched him.
He lives with his drooling-ass
old grandmother.
Sits in front of the TV
all the time.
You think she's gonna
rat me out?
She don't know her ass
from last Tuesday.
You fuck her?
Jesus Christ.
Is everything fucking sex
with you?
With me?
I fuck one person.
I ain't out there
serial fornicating,
trying to float my liver,
drinking myself silly
'cause I can't stand
what a piece of shit I am.
What are you,
Sigmund Sawed-off Fucking Freud?
Yeah, that's right.
Go ahead.
Talk about my height.
Make it about something safe
'cause you're
an emotional cripple.
Your soul is dog shit.
Every single fucking thing
about you is ugly.
Come on, Lois.
Let's get out of here.
Look who's here, Jimmy.
It's Santa.
That's fucking great.
Let's tell him what you want
for Christmas.
Fuck.
I'm on my fucking
lunch break, okay?
Are you insane?
Management's gonna hear
about this.
You think that's a threat?
If you think you can make my
life any worse, go right ahead.
Be my fucking guest.
Take a shot.
Just looking.
Aah!
Find everything
you're looking for?
Um, yeah.
Thank you.
Nothing I can help
you with, huh?
No. I'm just looking at
the games 'cause I have an Xbox.
Get your hands
out of my pants, man!
You're stealing from the store,
you're stealing from me.
What is this?
I was gonna pay for it.
Wrong answer.
When I look at you,
you know what I think?
I think America has
a sad future ahead of it.
And you're part
of this sorry-ass generation.
What you want to be
when you grow up?
I don't know.
- This MP3?
- Yeah.
Take it off.
But my grandmother gave...
Take it off. I don't care
who gave it to you.
Take it off.
I don't care if it choke you
to death.
Now, I want you to get on
out of here. Get!
- But can I have...
- Get!
Happy Kwanzaa.
And pull your damn pants up!
What's wrong with you kids
these days?
Gin?
- Yeah.
- What do you need?
I need you to run a plate
for me.
It's Arizona plates.
Hold on.
Let me get a pen.
Is that it?
For Christ's sake, make a move
and stick with it, would you?
King me.
Son of a bitch!
You lousy, cheating little shit!
You're fucking with me!
You did that on purpose.
You play like the dead lice
are falling off of you,
and then suddenly, you're like
Seabiscuit all over the place.
You're a smartass,
is what you are, kid.
Want to play again?
Howdy.
Herb Gunner.
I live two streets over
on Burning Trail Road.
I don't think we've met.
I'm Uncle Willie.
I'm organizing the decorations
for the subdivision this year.
- You mind if I come in?
- Yeah.
I mean yeah, I mind.
Okay. Uh...
Will you be participating in our
luminarias program this year?
- What the hell is a lunamaria?
- They're luminarias.
Small sacks filled with
about a pound of sand each.
We insert a candle
in the middle, light it,
and the bag glows.
Then we line
all the sidewalks here
all around the neighborhood.
You see, we don't celebrate
Christmas around here, so...
We're, uh, we're Muslims.
Look, it's my first year
running this.
I'd like it if there weren't
any gaps in it.
What if I come by
Christmas Eve and do it for you?
No, you know what?
You don't have to do that.
Yeah, me and the kid here,
we'll do something.
Great.
I got the supplies.
- I'll throw them in the garage.
- Perfect.
Awesome.
Going in the garage,
just so you know.
You can make
a delicious six-pound chicken.
Enough hot dogs and sausages
to feed a small army.
Not one, but two delicious
rotisserie chickens.
Fuck me, Santa. Fuck me, Santa.
Fuck me, Santa.
Fuck me, Santa.
Fuck me, Santa. Fuck me, Santa.
Scrumptious
And everybody's favorite,
baby back ribs.
This is such a nice house.
Needs a woman's touch, though.
I just rent
the fucking place anyway.
Yeah.
I just rent stuff, too.
Yeah?
How long are you gonna be here?
What? On the couch?
No.
In town.
I don't know.
Just through the holidays.
You know, then I'll move on.
So, do you like kids?
Fuck, no!
Do you think
I'm some kind of pervert?
I just mean because
you're Santa Claus.
Oh.
I like kids.
I really like kids.
- You do?
- I love kids.
Well, good.
Yeah, they're something else,
those kids.
And to tell you the truth...
The fact of the matter is,
I'm not Santa.
Like ya anyway.
So, you'll call me, right?
Yeah.
I'll call you.
I'm gonna buy you some flowers.
Some of those
really good expensive ones.
Shut up.
Bye.
Roger, you're home.
Let me fix you some sandwiches.
What the fuck?
Kid, what the fuck
is wrong with you?
Jesus Christ!
Let me see it!
Let me see it!
What the hell happened to you?!
I cut my hand by mistake!
Ow!
- Of course it was by mistake.
- Ow!
Here, hold still.
Hold still.
I was just trying to help you!
I forgot to say,
"It's gonna sting a little bit."
Shouldn't I wrap it
in a T-shirt or something?
God damn it.
- Hey, kid?
Kid, you okay up there?
You need a Band-Aid
or something?
Aw, shit.
You're late.
Kids.
Let me tell you.
They run you ragged.
Morning, team.
Hey, hey, hey.
It's not quite 8:00 yet.
Well, how close are we?
Now it's 8:00.
Merry Christmas.
Up your ass.
God damn it!
You tear your ball again?
I don't think so.
That's it.
God damn it!
Sweetheart,
don't romance 'em, now.
Go on and get in there.
I can take it.
Yeah.
Gin, I got the info
on that Arizona plate.
All right.
Now you're talking.
Oh, hold on one minute.
Baby, baby. Baby, baby.
Don't use that one.
That's not the stuff.
Use something
with some claws to it.
Yeah, that hard candy.
That's it right there.
Let me get some of that.
Yeah, that's it.
Okay.
Yeah, I'm back.
The guy's Roger Merman.
- Guess where he is.
- Give it to me.
Ow! Damn it!
What's wrong with you, woman?
Who are you?
Your name Roger Merman?
Yes. But...
You doing three to six
for embezzlement?
Uh, well, many accounting
questions are not cut-and-dried.
Do you live at 41 Sage Terrace?
Is it Grandma?
Is my son all right?
They're fine.
Do you have any houseguests?
Houseguests?
Thank you for your time.
God bless.
Well, hey, who are you?
Houseguests?
Little trick I learned
up at the North Pole.
If you fry baloney,
it tastes like a hot dog.
I thought you
didn't like sandwiches.
Yeah, but this
is not a sandwich.
A sandwich has
two pieces of bread
with a bunch of junk on it.
It's like a tostada.
This isn't a tostada.
There you go, Granny.
Little salsa here.
Now it's a tostada.
Have you seen
my Advent calendar?
What the fuck is it
with the Advent calendar?
Why are you so obsessed
with that goddamn thing?
The story sucks anyway.
I think I saw it in the hallway.
- Really?
- I think so.
Looks like someone messed
with my Advent calendar.
What are you talking about?
Let me see.
Nobody messed with it.
It looks fine.
There's a candy corn
in this one.
Well, they can't all be winners,
can they?
Well, it's fucked.
Yeah?
Yeah.
- Fucked, frankly.
- He's...
- Clean...
- Oh.
- As a fucking whistle.
- Nothing?
- No.
- Oh.
- Nothing. I mean shit.
- Yeah.
- He curses.
- Yeah?
- But never around children.
- Oh.
- No criminal record.
- Yeah.
- No parking tickets.
- Nothing.
- No bad habits, even.
- Oh.
Sex, yeah.
- But man is a sexual being.
- Yeah.
- Fuckin' Darwinian.
- Oh.
- You can't do shit about that.
- No.
Hell, I wouldn't want to.
No, of course not.
I'm not advocating celibacy.
Hope not. It'd be the end
of the fucking human race.
Yeah.
Fucks large women.
What can I say?
Hey, look,
it's the retard again.
Wedgie.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Well, what the hell do you want?
Pokémon!
Done.
You probably shouldn't
be digging in your ass.
Santa...
Oh, jeez.
- Is that your underwear?
- Part of it.
Where the hell's the rest of it?
No, actually, don't tell me.
What do you want?
I was thinking I wanted a purple
stuffed elephant, not pink.
But now I changed my mind.
- Yeah, what?
- Now I don't want an elephant.
I want a gorilla named Davey
for beating up the skateboard
kids who pull on my underwear.
He could take his orders
from the talking walnut,
so it wouldn't be my bad thing.
Jesus, kid.
When I was your age,
I didn't need no gorilla,
and I wasn't as big
as one of your legs.
Four kids beat me up
and I went crying to my daddy.
- You know what he did?
- He made it all better?
No, he kicked my ass.
You know why?
'Cause you went to the bathroom
on Mommy's dishes?
What the fuck?
No.
He tried to teach you
not to cry and be a man?
No. It's because he was
a mean, drunk son of a bitch.
When he wasn't busting my ass,
he was putting cigarettes out
on my neck.
The world ain't fair.
You gotta take what you need
when you can get it.
Learn to stand up for yourself.
Quit being a pussy.
Kick these kids
in the balls or something.
Or don't.
Shit, I don't care.
Just leave me out of it.
Now, get on out of here.
Okay.
Thanks, Santa.
Go get the next lucky boy
or girl, okay?
All right, next.
Open the ropes there, Marcus.
I know you?
Not yet.
Seven cities in seven years.
Pretty impressive.
The store changes,
your name changes.
But you always get away clean.
Yeah.
Pretty darn impressive.
Well, let's face the facts.
Y'all are a couple
of half-bucket small-timers.
You, because of your physical
attributes, found a niche,
and I respect that.
But you also been caught...
...by me.
So this is how it's gonna be.
I don't want to take over.
I don't even want to change
your scam.
Whatever you guys do, it works.
All I want is a taste.
When the deed is done,
we part ways.
I'll buy a little ranch
in Havasu,
and you all take your little
medicine show back on the road.
- How much?
- Half.
No way! You don't know
who you're fucking with.
Back off, Will.
I got this. I got this!
Okay. 30%.
There's three of us.
Half.
I meant 33%...
I meant half.
...and 1/3.
Half.
Half.
Half.
Half.
Half.
Half.
Half.
Well, what's one point?
We split the dough
right down the middle.
Any merchandise you take, I get
to look at and cherry-pick.
No! Money's one thing,
but you ain't gettin' the...
This ain't no Chinese menu,
jagoff.
I tell you how it's gonna be.
This is pricks fix.
Pricks fix?
He's a fucking moron.
Oh, really?
Is that how you got
the upper hand?
Fuck you.
Negotiating?
If you don't like,
next year, fuck off.
I can always get
another box jockey.
I can get another midget, too.
Yeah, where?
You see us hanging off of trees
like fucking crab apples?
Even if we did, you'd never
front your own racket.
You know why, Willie?
You got no discipline.
You got zero fuckin' initiative.
You'd fall apart without me.
You're too pathetic for words.
You're a fucking loser,
and you fucking know it.
Santa'll be here real soon,
kids. Real soon.
There he is.
Look.
Oh, no.
Oh, my God!
Sweet Jews for Jesus.
I pissed myself.
What the fuck
do you think you doing?
You son of a bitch!
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey.
Hey, come on, come on.
Look, hey!
Come on, come on!
Look here.
Get him out of here.
I'll smooth things over
with Chipeska.
- Tell him food poisoning.
- "Get him out of here"?
Take him to the car.
In case you hadn't noticed,
I'm a motherfuckin' dwarf.
So unless you got
a forklift handy,
maybe you should
lend a hand, hmm?
That figures. You want
all kind of set-asides.
Special treatment
'cause you're handicapped.
You all the same.
Special treatment?
I'm 3-foot-fucking-tall,
you asshole!
It's a matter of physics.
Draw me a sketch of how
I get him to the car, huh?
Bitch, bitch, bitch.
Sketch it up, you moron.
Fucking Leonardo da Vinci.
What you call me, thigh high?
I called you
a fucking guinea homo
from the 15th-fucking-century,
you dickhead!
I could stick you up my ass,
small fry.
Yeah? You sure it ain't
too sore from last night?
You got some lip on you, midget.
Well, these lips were on
your wife's pussy last night.
Why don't you dust that
thing off once in a while?
Asshole.
I pissed my pants.
Oh, shut up.
Santa.
Santa?
What?
What are you doing?
Nothing.
You going to work today?
Not really.
You just gonna sit there?
Yeah.
Just let me alone, okay?
Hey, wait a minute.
Hey, kid?
Yeah?
I want you to take this letter.
When the paramedics come
to bag Santa up,
there's gonna be
some cops there.
I want you to make sure that
those cops get that envelope.
What is it?
It just tells
all the bad things that...
What the fuck happened
to your eye?
Fucking little prick!
So you like to give little kids
black eyes, huh?
How 'bout you, huh?!
You want some?!
Anybody else?
Anybody else? Come on!
Yeah, there you go.
You know, I think
I've turned a corner.
Yeah?
You fucking petites now?
No. I'm not talking about that.
I beat the shit
out of some kids today.
But it was for a purpose.
It made me feel good
about myself.
It was like I did something
constructive with my life.
I don't know.
Like I accomplished something.
You need many years of therapy.
Many, many, many
fuckin' years of therapy.
Okay. You don't drink,
which is smart on your part.
But being sober can put you
at a disadvantage
when it comes to violence.
I can't box worth a shit, see.
But I'm good in a fight
because I can't feel anything.
You, you're gonna feel
everything.
Okay.
Now put your dukes up.
Let me see what you got.
This is bullshit!
Give me one good reason why I
should even consider doing this.
'Cause I let 2,000 kids
spit in my face for your ass.
That's why.
Now, I'm asking you
for this one thing.
Come on, look at the kid.
He is pathetic.
Yeah, he's just a little...
He's a fucking retard.
Yeah, let's show him
a couple of things
so he can defend himself, then.
Unless you're scared.
All right,
here's what's gonna happen.
Marcus is a bully, right?
He's gonna pull your underwear
up out of your pants.
Now, what do you do?
I don't know.
God damn it!
You don't know?
If somebody wants to pull your
underwear up out of your pants,
you have to get mad.
Yeah, kid, come on.
Get mad.
Scream at him.
Jesus fucking Christ.
Listen at him.
He's a fucking faggot.
Loud! Scream!
Be loud! Be mean!
Piss him off!
Come on!
Aah!
You don't
hit people in the balls,
you asshole!
Aah!
What the fuck's wrong with you?
He's just a kid.
- Fuck you, Willie!
- Ow!
God damn it.
I told you
I didn't want to do this!
Making me...
Ohh!
Oh, shit.
Kid, maybe you shouldn't spend
so much time around me.
You sneaky little prick.
Fuck you!
Little bastard!
Get off me!
Shut up. That's not even
what you said.
Oh, God damn it,
I forgot about that.
We got a fucking nursing home
around here.
Well, we can go in another room.
She does look kind of still,
doesn't she?
Hey, Granny?
Hey, Granny.
Hey, there, Granny?
Oh, Granny.
Oh, my God.
What the fuck?
Oh, shit.
- Roger!
- God!
- God damn it! Shit!
- You're home.
- Please just tap me.
- Let me fix some sandwiches.
Hello, little boy.
Hello.
Santa...
I know that Christmas Eve
is in a couple days,
and you have to fly around
the world
and give presents to everyone,
and you won't be around anymore.
Yeah?
So I thought I'd give you
your present now.
What the fuck is it?
It's a wooden pickle.
- Why'd you paint it brown?
- It's not paint.
It's blood from when I cut
my hand making it for you.
Oh.
Well, shit, kid, I don't know.
I...
Thanks.
You're welcome.
Good night, Santa.
Good night, Mrs. Santa's sister.
Good night, sweetie.
Oh, my God.
That was so sweet.
He's a really sweet kid,
isn't he?
Yeah, I guess so.
Come on, baby.
Come here.
What?
Oh, nothing.
I'm all right.
Just a little tired.
Oh.
Santa!
God damn it!
Whoa! Shit!
Want to see my report card?
You scared the holy shit
out of me.
Think I did good?
How would I know? I haven't seen
the fuckin' thing yet.
Who the fuck is Thurman?
- Is your name Thurman?
- Yeah.
Thurman Merman?
Yeah.
Jesus.
So, you think I did good?
What do you care
what I think, anyway?
Hell, I guess you did better
than I did.
I never got any B's.
I thought maybe at least
since I did good in school,
maybe you'd bring me a present.
'Cause last year
and the year before that,
you didn't bring me
any presents.
Even though I'm a dipshit loser.
Jesus fucking Christ, kid!
Why do you talk about
yourself that way?!
Let me give you some news.
I'm not Santa Claus, all right?
Take a look at me.
Do I look like Santa Claus?
As a matter of fact,
I'm living fucking proof
that there's not a Santa Claus.
I know there's no Santa.
I just thought maybe you'd
want to give me a present
'cause we're friends.
There he is.
That lousy, leather-faced,
frog-eyed, motherfucker.
- Good night, Gin.
- Good night.
Jesus, Mother Mary, and Joseph.
What is the problem now?
I'm sorry.
The van stalled.
Will you give us a jump, please?
I'll be dipped in dog shit.
Do I look like
an auto mechanic to you?
I appreciate it.
All right, small fry,
help yourself.
I can't reach it.
Jesus Christ, give me that.
Thanks.
All right, hit it.
Oh, my.
What a terrible accident.
Mm-mm-mmm.
- Is he dead?
- No.
But it looks like
you broke most of his ribs.
I'd say maybe 50% of them,
or do you think 30%?
I needed more
of a running start.
I couldn't build up
enough speed.
Merry Christmas Eve.
Got you a little something.
You shouldn't have.
You should put that stuff
in the kitchen.
God damn, you look good.
Here you go.
Little behind there, sweetie?
We don't need any more
of this shit.
"Christmas keeps us connected
to each other in peace.
The angel is going to tell
everyone in the world."
Aspirin?
Shit!
Jesus.
Santa?
- What?
- I was gonna make sandwiches.
I could make you one
before you leave.
Listen, kid, I don't know.
I got shit to do and everything.
Okay, make me some sandwiches.
I gotta go to the mall
and talk to somebody.
I'll be back.
For dinner?
Yeah, that's what I said.
Yeah.
How many sandwiches do you want?
Uh, a bunch.
How much lettuce do you want?
I don't know.
The usual amount.
Whatever the hell people do.
Whatever you think.
Okay.
Have a very merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.
- Good night.
Merry Christmas.
Good night.
- Good night.
- Okay! Happy holiday!
Attention, shoppers.
The store will be closing
in five minutes.
We wish you all
a merry Christmas,
a happy Hanukkah,
and a joyous Kwanzaa.
All right, hold it steady.
Oh, yeah, shit, let's do it.
Oh, Christ.
Merry Christmas.
Good night.
Merry Christmas, Willie.
Up your ass.
Aaaah!
Whoa!
Oh, shit.
What?
What?
It's a Kitnerboy Redoubt.
So?
Remember Andy Pitz?
Andy Pitzorella?
Yeah.
No, Andy Ripitski.
Andy Pitzorella
was Andy Blue Balls.
Since he got married,
they call him Andy Pitzorella.
What's your fucking point?!
They say he can get
into anything.
Anything.
They say he's been
in Margaret Thatcher's pussy.
And that's a good thing?
So what the fuck
are you getting at?
When I was
in the joint with him,
he told me that the Kitnerboy
Redoubt can't be cracked.
Are you shittin' me?
Are you telling me
that after I propped you up,
held you together,
smiled for all those kids,
danced for all those
fucking housewives
in a fucking lime-green,
fucking velvet elf costume,
that you cannot
get in this fucking safe?!
Is that what you're
telling me?! Huh?!
No, I'm just saying
it's gonna take a minute.
Fuck.
Shit.
Fuck!
Piece of cake.
I gotta get one more thing.
I'll be right back.
Oh, shit.
Which one did he say?
I'll bet the store dick
don't want this.
Store dick don't want shit.
What do you mean?
Store dick's dead.
Store dick don't want shit.
He's dead, huh?
I didn't even know he was sick.
Willie...
this has been
a long time coming.
Every year, you're worse.
Every year, less reliable.
More booze.
More bullshit.
More buttfucking.
Sure, the three B's.
You gotta be able to rely,
Willie.
You people are monsters.
There's no joy in this for me.
I'm not talking about
you taking me out.
That part, I get.
But look at all that shit.
Do you really need
all that shit?
For Christ sakes,
it's Christmas.
It is Christmas, Willie.
But this is what we do.
We get the shit.
Christmastime, we get the shit.
Because we are men and Lois.
It is Christmas, Willie.
And we are men and Lois.
What you waiting for, honey?
Come on, plug him.
Goodbye, Willie.
- Drop the gun.
- Huh?!
And you, Santa,
drop the elephant.
- Where did you come from?
- Tipped off.
Shit, that fucking kid.
All three of you are in so much
shit, it's almost unbelievable.
Marcus, hop on!
Fuck me.
Hey, hey!
This is Christmas, and the kid's
getting his fucking present.
Halt, police!
Put your hands up!
I said freeze!
Freeze!
- Aaaah!
- Aaaah!
"Dear kid...
I hope that you got my present
and that there wasn't
too much blood on it,
although there was blood
on the present you gave me,
which didn't keep me
from enjoying it.
So maybe the blood doesn't
matter so much, I guess."
"Anyway, just in case
they took it as evidence,
I'm also sending you a T-shirt.
I hope it's the right size."
"I'm healing up good,
and they tell me
that I will soon be 100%,
even with 8 bullets
dug out of me,
because they didn't hit
any vital organs,
just my liver,
which is fucked anyway.
Ha ha ha.
Thank you for giving
that letter to the cops.
I forgot I asked you to do it,
but it's a good thing you did
or Santa's little helper
would've plugged his ass.
Now the cops know I wrote it,
which is gonna keep my ass
out of jail.
That, plus everyone agreeing
that the Phoenix police
shooting an unarmed Santa
was even more fucked up
than Rodney King."
"The cops are treating me
like fucking royalty now,
which is new in my experience.
They're gonna make me
a sensitivity counselor
so that tragedies like this
will never again embarrass
the whole fucking department.
I told the cops you had no one
to take the fuck care of you,
so they set it up
with Mrs. Santa's sister
watching you
till your dad gets back
in one year and three months.
They made her a guardian
pro tem or some such shit.
Anyway, she seems to like you
and your house and Jacuzzi.
I sent her some money,
so if you play
your cards right,
you can probably get her
to buy you something.
As for my little helper,
I'm sorry to have to tell you
that him and his
prune-faced, mail-order wife
are gonna be exploring
mountains with your dad.
I hope your dad doesn't go
sucking shit from them
like I did.
They're supposed to let me
out of this hospital room soon,
so get some sandwiches ready.
Until then, don't take
no shit from nobody,
least of all yourself.
Ho ho ho.
Your pal, Santa."
Hey, loser.
I hear your buddy's not here
to protect you anymore.
See you got me a new bike.
Thanks a lot.
I'm talking to you, fat-ass!
Aaah!
