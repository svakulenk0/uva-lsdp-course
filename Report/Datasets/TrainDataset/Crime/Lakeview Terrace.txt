ANNOUNCER: Joining me now
to talk more about that,
Lieutenant Solomon Goff from the
Esmeralda County Sheriff's Department.
Lieutenant Goff,
at this hour,
what is going on
up at the fire line?
GOFF: Well, they're just doing
the best they can to put it out.
There's about 450
fire personnel up there
and the fire is going in all
different directions. We're...
You alive in there?
CELIA: Almost.
All right. Shake a leg.
Well, the beach cities today
are gonna be in the mid-90s.
What a great day
to hit the surf.
And downtown Los Angeles, I'm
forecasting a cool 102 degrees.
And hey, you folks
out in the valleys,
get ready for a
record-breaking May high...
Stand up.
What'd I tell you
about that jersey?
It's clean.
We're not advertising
that guy, okay?
Why not?
'Cause he don't
approve of him.
He's, like,
Marcus. Another
shirt, please.
Look, Son.
We talked about this, right?
We decided to make
the jump to Shaq.
Doesn't approve.
What?
What's the rule?
I don't know,
you got so many.
Have. I have so many.
And let me remind you,
not at the table.
It's disrespectful.
One, two, three
strikes. It's out.
But Aunt Dorrie
gave me this.
I'll give it back to her.
CELIA: I'm
changing my name.
MARCUS: How come?
'Cause I don't wanna be
from this family no more.
Anymore.
What about me?
You're on your own.
So you're not going
to Aunt Dorrie's this summer?
I'm going.
Am I coming back,
is the question.
Who's this?
You think they'll let us
swim in their pool?
HAROLD: Never
this hot in Oakland.
LISA: Oh, stop complaining.
CELIA: Come on. Hurry up.
CHRIS: I'll start unloading.
MARCUS: Coming.
LISA: Okay, yeah. That's great.
We're here.
LISA: Well,
I really like this...
HAROLD: All right.
I can't believe
how imprudent you are.
Did an inspector take
a look at that?
LISA: Yes.
It's totally stable.
They're building townhouses
there next year.
LISA: Can you not be
such a grump?
Can you not be
such a grump?
You made this possible.
You helped a lot.
This is so great.
I love you.
Johnny, my man.
How you doing?
New neighbors?
Yeah, looks like it.
Did you meet them yet?
You wanna give people a chance
to settle in, you know?
I'll wait till
the movers leave.
How much you think
they paid?
I don't know, man.
Hell of a lot more
than I did 20 years ago.
Still the best investment.
Up, up, up.
When you're right,
you're right.
Have a good one.
You'll make it,
you have plenty of time.
Well, the pilot's
already checked in.
And I don't mind
driving you to the airport.
You might look
good in a Prius.
That man won't mind driving me
either, and I'm willing to tip him.
Okay.
Bye.
Chris.
Harold.
Always a pleasure.
Yeah.
You check in.
Okay.
Let us know how
things are going.
You know how
your mother gets.
What a shame he lives
It makes me sad.
Yeah. Yeah.
You gonna cry?
Can he move in?
Come on.
Come, come, come.
What the...
What is that?
I don't know.
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.
That's my only Prada.
What?
Oh!
That's better.
He's got security lights.
Who does?
Whoever, next door.
He's got one
on a pole in the back.
I told you we should've
put sheets on the windows.
Sheets?
We need bricks.
Hey, babe?
Yeah?
I look okay?
It's gonna be a hundred
and something degrees.
I know, but I can't do
this in just a shirt.
They'll think it's rude.
Oh, is that where
you're gonna put the...
Yes, it is, because
I like this space
and I'm the one
that's here all day long.
Okay?
Perfect.
So I'll call you,
like, 2:00-ish.
You're okay
driving the truck back?
Oh, gosh, I don't know.
Maybe if you showed me where
the key goes in the little...
I'll show you
where the key in the...
I gotta go.
Okay. Break legs.
Hey.
Yeah.
We're homeowners.
Oh! Sweetie, your bag.
Babe?
What the...
Here you go.
I got a ticket.
Yeah, well, you are
hanging out a little bit.
Well... So what? Are we living
in Bel Air or something?
Sweetheart,
it's not filled out. Look.
"Welcome
to Lakeview, neighbor.
"Observe all
parking regulations."
"A.T."
Look at you,
making nice-nice.
Oh, gosh.
A little cop humor.
He's here to protect
and serve us.
Maybe we can
borrow his handcuffs.
Ooh! I like that.
Hey, we can go over
tonight and say hello.
Okay.
Don't work too hard.
Never.
MAN 1: Out of here.
Yo, chief!
MAN 2: Let's roll, man.
Five-O. Come on!
Let's get out of here, man.
Clarence Darlington, hold!
Don't run. Hey, hey!
Don't make us chase you.
CLARENCE:
Nobody say nothing.
Shit!
Come here.
Front and center, let's go.
Right here.
Some  French
Connection bullshit.
Watch your mouth.
Come on, on the car.
Pulling this shit on me?
In front of my people?
I would never do
that to you, dawg.
This is for
your benefit, man.
Now it looks like you fought
the law and the law won.
You can go back
and be the man,
instead of the crack-dealing
little snitch that you are.
Forget the circumstance.
Shit's disrespectful
to a brother.
Brother? Clarence,
we ain't brothers.
We didn't even crawl out of
the same evolutionary pool.
What are you, anyway?
You know, I always wondered about that.
You a Euro-Mexi-Japa-Chine-stani
or what?
You don't even know, do you?
Ain't got a clue.
Watch yourself.
You're a weed, that's what you are.
A junkyard weed.
Spray your ass
with some Roundup.
I'm 1/7th Cherokee, bitch!
Yeah, and the
other 93% wigger.
Can you do the math
on that, dumb ass?
You got problems, man.
Seriously.
This shit aside,
you don't see straight.
What you got
for me, Clarence?
Give me something other than this
fake-ass Vanilla Ice impression.
I know who popped
that kid on Palm Grove.
Leontro Wilson.
He's running with a crew
up in the Baldwin Village.
You got an address?
What?
You're the sworn officer.
Go knock on some
doors and shit.
Are we done? I got quotas, too.
Hold, hold, hold, hold.
One thing. One thing.
You get to stay in business as
long as you're useful, okay?
All right, man,
you told me.
Oh, and one other thing.
No more little girls.
I don't wanna see that shit.
Baby ain't too little for me.
Just 'cause they don't
scream when you use them
doesn't mean
they're not little.
You understand me?
Now bounce.
Prick.
JAVIER: Watch
your ass, big guy.
Knew not who I was,
but listen here
Dres, D-R-E-S,
yes I get suckers start
If it's all right with you,
I'll rip this here one apart
Back, Middle,
to the front, don't front
Wanna a good time,
gonna give you what you want
The styling is creative,
Black Sheep of the Native
Can't be violated,
or even decepticated
Deaf retarded uncles,
in parties were they rest
Guess, which way,
what, when, how
Mista Lawnge, Dres,
Black Sheep slam now
Know you've heard the others,
phonies to the lovers
Then of course,
the choice is yours
You can get with this,
or you can get with that
You can get with this,
or you can get with that
You can get with this,
or you can get with that
You can get with this,
or you can get with that
ABEL: Give me your wallet.
Give up the wallet, man.
Give it up!
Oh, shit.
Come on, hurry up! Give it up!
And turn that shit down!
God damn it.
Boy, you got a lot to learn.
What?
Never roll your window
down when somebody does that.
No matter where
you are, Chris.
You scared
the hell out of me.
Well, how else
you gonna learn?
Abel Turner.
Hey. Yeah, Chris...
Mattson.
Yeah. I was
meaning to come over.
You got a lot
on your hands.
Yeah, well,
you know, moving and...
It's very stressful, you know?
Yeah.
But you got your mad beats and your
blunt here to help you chill out.
Oh, it's just
a cigarette. Organic.
Okay. Not against
the law yet.
Well, it is in my house.
I hear you.
So are you
a SoCal boy, Chris?
Chicago.
Went to Berkeley
on a lacrosse scholarship.
Stayed there after college.
Doing what?
I work for Good.
Oh, the enemy of evil.
You a superhero there, Chris?
No, the supermarket
chain. Yeah.
They're expanding down here,
so we talked it over...
You and your wife?
Yeah, Lisa.
Is she from Chicago, too?
No, she's from up there.
Berkeley.
Oakland.
Oak-town girl, all right!
Kind of, like,
opposites attract.
Well, no, not exactly.
We actually have a lot in common.
Yeah? Like what?
Uh, well...
Oh! Rap music.
Well, I like it,
she doesn't.
Imagine that.
Yeah.
Yeah, well, I'm going
to finish my rounds.
You know, I do a little neighborhood
patrol every night, you know?
Oh. Cool. Welcome.
Good to have you.
Thanks, yeah. Nice to meet you.
Mmm-hmm.
All right.
Say, you know,
you can listen to that
noise all night long,
but when you wake up in the
morning, you'll still be white.
CHRIS: There you are.
Hi.
How's the water?
Amazing.
How was your day?
Awesome.
So I met our new neighbor.
A.T. Abel Turner.
And?
He has a very
special brand of humor.
So he was joking.
Yeah.
Did you ask him
about the lights?
Wasn't the best time.
Oh.
I always wanted to say this.
What?
"Honey, I'm homeowner."
No, that's really bad.
No, it's good.
No, it's bad.
But I'm gonna kiss you
and make it better.
What are you doing?
Move over.
Time to christen the pool.
We can't.
Come on.
It's our house.
LISA: Hurry up
and get in the pool.
CELIA: You're gonna
go to hell.
I am not.
Yes, you are.
God's gonna send you
down there with a stiffy
and everyone's
gonna laugh.
Man, you told me to look.
You were dumb
enough to do it.
MARCUS:
Get off me!
Marcus? Celia?
Don't say anything.
What the hell is
going on up here?
You're supposed to be
looking out for him.
I wasn't doing nothing.
Marcus, hey, hey, hey.
I wasn't doing what?
Anything. I wasn't
doing anything.
What the hell
are you fighting...
Um...
Look, why don't
you guys wash up?
Let's go downstairs and have some
big bowls of ice cream. Okay?
Babe?
Can I ask you a question?
Mmm-hmm.
This house has
three bedrooms, right?
And there's two of us.
Mmm-hmm.
So, you know, like,
how many offices or dens,
whatever-type rooms,
does one need, really?
Well, we could...
I always wanted
a sewing room for me.
Sewing.
Come on, we'll, you know...
No.
No, I don't know.
I mean, I know
that we could
turn one of those rooms
into a nursery...
No.
...if we wanted to.
Or not.
Lis, come on,
we've talked about this.
We'll get around to it.
It's just...
Right now, we don't know how
any of this is gonna play out.
Okay. I just think
that there are really
good reasons to not wait.
No, you're right.
In fact, to do this right now.
No, I...
You know?
Like, I'm not only
thinking about us.
I'm thinking
about our families.
I think that our families
would really benefit from...
I know, I know,
I know, I know.
Are you hot?
No. Are you kidding?
No.
No.
It isn't working.
Here you go.
Why is it so loose?
Probably forgot
to screw it back in.
The joys of
home ownership.
What's that?
It's a good
image for an antismoking campaign.
You've gotta be kidding me.
I'll talk to him tomorrow.
Mr. Turner.
You can call me Abel.
Morning.
Getting your miles in?
Before it gets too hot.
Or before
I talk myself out of it.
Yeah, I hear you on that.
Need a hand?
Matter of fact, I do.
Trying to reach this bolt
down here behind the battery.
I need you to hold it
this way, just pull it.
There you go.
Come on.
I got it.
You all right?
Yeah, just...
Let's see.
Oh, yeah, you're not
bleeding too bad.
It's all right.
You're a tough guy.
Must have
some Irish in you.
Black Irish, probably.
Hey, you didn't see
anyone around
the side of our house
last night, did you?
Something happen?
Lisa's a little paranoid.
Got an alarm system, right?
Yeah, it's kind of wonky.
You might want
to get that fixed.
You know, you got a woman
you wanna try and protect.
Well, you know,
this is stupid,
but your outside
lights over here...
Mmm-hmm.
What about them?
They're shining
right into our upstairs.
I see how that
could be annoying.
Just till we get
some curtains up.
You know the arroyo back here that
runs along everybody's house?
There's some unsavory
characters down there.
You know, kids
with nothing to do.
They tag stuff, vandalize.
Been some break-ins.
Is that right?
I got a teenage daughter who
likes to sneak out at night
if I don't stay
on top of it.
You know what I mean?
I hear you.
I bet you don't want them shining down
on your pool deck at night, either.
I guess not.
Celia, Marcus.
This is Mr. Mattson.
He's the man on the other
side of the fence.
Say hi.
Hi.
All right.
See you, guys.
MARCUS: Bye, Dad.
Thanks for your time.
CELIA: Okay, get out
of the way. Move.
MARCUS: No,
don't kick the ball.
Move!
You're stupid!
What'd you do that for?
Now the lady's coming.
LISA: Hello?
Hey.
She did it.
Come get it.
Dad never let us over here.
LISA: Why not?
He don't want us
being freeloaders.
That's a good
thing to not be.
You don't even know
what a freeloader is.
Somebody that can
swim in this pool.
Well, you guys can swim
here anytime you want.
You just need
to ask your parents.
Parent.
Our mom died.
LISA: Oh.
I'm sorry.
So it's just you guys
and your dad?
Yeah. But he has enough
rules for two people.
Yeah, well,
that's how dads are.
It'll get better
as you get older.
No. He will never
change his mind.
What he says is what goes, and the
more you argue, the more he's like,
"Excuse me? I am the law."
Anyways, I like your hair.
Thank you. I'm Lisa.
Celia.
And you are?
I'm Marcus.
Nice to meet you.
So, Celia, can you
do me a favor?
Sure.
My husband and I are having a
housewarming party here on Friday
and I would love it if you and
your dad and Marcus all came over
so we could kind
of get acquainted.
You don't have
to invite Marcus.
She already did.
So I'll see you Friday.
Okay.
Yes.
Okay.
Nice to meet you guys.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Corporations owe Dey
gotta give up the dough
Shut 'em, shut 'em down,
I shut 'em down
Shut 'em down, shut 'em,
shut 'em down
Okay, okay, okay.
Hey.
Hello there.
Late night?
Well, you know, big town.
A lot of people
to suck up to.
So, honey, these are...
Did you talk to him
about the lights?
Yeah. He's gonna
take care of it.
I'm gonna go talk to him.
No, I'll do it.
Here, let me.
No, because you...
Let me handle it. Please.
Okay.
All right.
Be nice.
I am nice.
And don't be all...
You know, 'cause he's...
What?
'Cause he's a brother.
He's your brother?
I didn't know that.
Chris.
Jesus.
Chris, what's up?
Hey, Abel.
Your lights?
Oh!
You know, I did not
get to that today.
Can't you just
turn them off?
No. You know,
they're on a master timer
with the rest of the outdoor
lights, sprinklers.
I'd have to do that whole
instruction manual thing, you know?
Right.
There's no excuse, you know.
I just had a hell of a day.
No, I know what you mean.
Want a beer?
No. Thanks.
But...
You'll...
Thanks.
Chris, wait. Hold it.
Be right with you,
wait a minute. All right?
Let me take you on patrol with
me, show you the neighborhood.
Okay.
Sure the neighbors
appreciate this.
Well, not everybody up here's
somebody you wanna live next to.
Like who?
This guy here,
for instance.
Sakorsky,
Sakwasky, whatever.
Beats on his wife.
I told her to come
straight to me, but...
You know, she didn't
have to live that way.
Did she...
Well, other
people's relationships.
You think somebody
shouldn't be with somebody,
but you can't say that to
their face, now can you?
Yup.
Over here, now, got some dealing
going on, I think, you know?
Pills, weed, maybe
a little coke, meth.
A lot of coming and going.
Interesting thing is
guy's got a different car
in the driveway every week.
Maybe he's a car dealer.
So what'd they tell you
about the hillside?
Behind the house?
Hmm.
Said there was
a slide 10 years ago,
county reinforced it,
and now they're clearing it
out for condos or whatever.
Yeah. Hope they knew
what they were doing.
Look, Abel, we're here.
Okay?
And we're counting on
being here a few years.
We really want this
to be our home.
Raise your family?
Yeah, eventually.
Don't wanna rush it,
though, right?
Whenever we decide,
that's our choice.
You and your wife?
Who else's would it be?
Ah! It's a brave new world.
How's that?
You know, I got nothing
against you. Or her.
LAPD. I work with all kinds.
I'd lay my life down
for those guys.
"All kinds?"
But that's where I work.
This is where I live.
I'm trying to raise
these kids by myself.
Teach them
to respect themselves
and the people
they come from.
So I don't need you
or your lady
putting your bedroom scenes
out here for them to see.
I don't think they're
ever going to forget
that little synchronized
swimming exhibition.
Me, either.
Look, Abel,
I'm sorry. I...
Maybe there's places
where that's okay.
And maybe that's
where you ought to live.
Hey.
They saw us.
Last night.
What do you mean?
In the pool.
Him, the kids...
Oh, my God.
I'm mortified.
Well, I don't think
he likes us anyway.
Well, honey, it's not the
best first impression.
No, I mean,
I don't think he likes
the idea of us
together as a couple.
Did he say that?
In so many words.
Then why would you say that?
Because I just know.
It's not like your
dad's my biggest fan.
Okay. There's a leap.
No, I... Just something
I picked up on.
Because your
parents are perfect.
My parents love you.
Oh, yeah, they must,
because they say it to my
face every time they see me.
That's a little harsh.
Come on, we said we
wouldn't do this, remember?
You are making assumptions about
his guy. You don't even know him.
I just walked around the entire
neighborhood with the guy.
I think I know him
better than you do.
Chris, you don't know him.
Oh, come on.
You don't.
You're right.
Whatever.
No, look. You're right.
Uh-huh.
I don't know him.
Guess I never will.
I'm off to bed.
Okay.
He's still not gonna
shut off the lights.
Lis, where's your bathroom?
Down the hall, to the right.
I'll get it.
Abel.
Chris, hey.
Welcome.
Nice jacket.
Yeah, I like it.
Mr. Turner,
I'm Lisa, Chris' wife.
Abel, please.
Oh.
And where are your kids?
They could not come.
Oh.
I'll take a drink, though.
Okay.
Right this way.
What are you having?
Anything wet.
Well, we have
a lot of that.
Wet and cold.
Okay.
Hey, Chris.
What?
You hit the
total jackpot, man.
I so want to date
a black girl.
I'm working my
way up, though,
doing the Pacific Rim
thing right now,
if you get what I mean.
Well, good luck with that.
DALE: You know, I heard something
on the news about fires.
Where?
Around Santa Clarita.
It's global warming.
Totally. This is not even normal.
Yeah. We gotta study
the problem further.
Don't wanna jump to conclusions.
Wouldn't be right.
He's right. It wouldn't be right.
Code red. Blue state.
A hundred-something degrees?
It's snowing at
the South Pole.
And it's hot in Africa.
What? I just mean
that's normal, right?
Anyway, there is an awful lot
of evidence piling up, so...
That something you studied up
at Berkeley, Chris?
No, Abel, just something
I'm interested in.
Oh, so you're not an expert?
I mean, you work for, like,
a grocery store chain or
something like that, right?
Yeah, with a pretty strong
environmental agenda.
Timeout. Debate over.
I don't even know what that means.
Well, what do you do, Abel?
I am a police officer.
DONNIE: Oh, you are?
Yes, sir.
Well, Chris, hide the pot.
Not the pot I'm worried about.
It's those cigarette butts he keeps flicking
over the fence so the wife won't see.
Dude, you're so busted.
Really?
Where do you patrol, Abel?
I'm assigned to the Valley
Bureau of the LAPD,
over near Panorama City.
You know where that is?
Uh... Yes. I think.
Been there?
Never been.
Come on down.
We'll show you some things.
Like how to be
an asshole.
I'm sorry, is there
something you wanna say?
No.
But you seem
to have an opinion
about law enforcement.
I'd like to hear it.
Oh, let's talk about something else.
Oh, no, no, no.
We could talk
about something else,
but I think your friends
wanna talk about this.
I just find that
there's an attitude.
Mmm-hmm?
You know, a kind of aggressiveness
when you deal with them.
Which I can
certainly understand.
I'm sorry, Miss...
Eden.
Eden.
Well, Eden, when you're getting
jacked outside your loft
and Dubya here doesn't have
the energy to stop it,
we'll see about sending the
nice police over to help you.
That's if it's not too late.
Oh, what is this?
White zinfandel.
NADINE: It's very refreshing.
Oh, good.
Well, it's getting late.
Chris, Lisa, thanks
for inviting me.
It's been enlightening.
Night, all.
Don't drink and drive.
EDEN: What time is it?
Yeah, let's go.
That's fresh dill.
Abel, hold on.
Look, the cigarettes,
I'm sorry.
I wasn't thinking.
I apologize.
Uh-huh.
But in
front of my wife?
That's really not cool.
You didn't like that?
No, I didn't.
And whatever it is about me,
or us, that bothers you,
we gotta figure out a way to
deal with this. All right?
So, what do you propose?
What?
What's your agenda?
My agenda is...
Can't we all
just get along?
Oh, not Rodney King.
You playing the race card?
Come on, man, this is getting a
little out of hand, I mean...
I need you to back off.
Back off?
Yeah, a little.
Or what?
See, you keep
saying stuff like that.
Like we're not welcome
here, we should move.
But we're
fitting in just fine.
Says who?
Maybe you're the one
with the problem.
I don't smoke.
You know what?
I said I was sorry.
Just stay out of my life.
Stay out of your life?
You have a good night, Chris.
Jesus...
What is it with
this neighborhood?
It's like they hate us.
Oh, honey?
Is that the Prius?
LISA: Honey, do you
see anything?
No. Hit the lights.
LISA: Okay.
Hey, babe? Did you
leave this door open?
No.
Oh, shit.
The tires are flat.
They're slashed.
Shit.
What are you...
Move, move.
Chris! Chris,
what are you doing?
God damn it.
Well, whoever it is,
they're gone.
ABEL: Everything
okay over there?
I thought I heard somebody
moving around over there.
Did you see anyone?
No.
I just see you.
So you're just not gonna
do anything about it?
I'm sorry, ma'am, there's
just not much we can do.
Abel, Officer Turner,
he said he heard some noises.
Sounded like somebody moving
along the side of your house.
I'm sure he did.
Well, you get some late-night
traffic from the arroyo back there.
Bunch of kids with
nothing better to do
than make other
people's lives miserable.
Yeah, I keep
hearing about them.
That's not much of a
lock on that door there.
But we'll take a swing around,
you know, see what we see.
It wasn't kids in the arroyo.
Then what was it?
Well, if you hear
any other noises, ma'am,
I'm sorry, just
give us a call, okay?
You guys are lucky.
You have a cop
living next door.
Thank you, Officer.
Thank you for all your help.
ABEL: Thanks, guys,
for coming out.
OFFICER: Hey,
we can come on back.
ABEL: Stay alert
out there, all right?
I guess we could
dust for prints.
Honey, next time,
use an ashtray.
How do you even
know it's mine?
Do you have any proof?
Not exactly.
But he told us we weren't
welcome in the neighborhood.
That's what he told me.
He refused to turn
off his floodlights,
he's made these implications
about Lisa and me,
and he was standing right there after
the whole car tire thing, just waiting.
Honey, do you
have any proof?
Chris just answered
that, Daddy.
No. No, not exactly, but...
The way it seems to me,
the man never made an actual threat
against your life or property.
So it's his word
against yours.
And he has, let's say,
the color issue on his side.
And that color
happens to be blue.
As for the lights,
you could file a civil suit.
I wouldn't advise it.
These things have a knack
for turning out badly.
Yeah, but why do we
have to be the ones to...
That was my
professional opinion.
What's the point of
carrying on with this?
You bought this
as a starter home.
Fine, you started.
Put it back on the market.
You take a loss, so what?
Then you can do what
we wanted you to do,
which is let us help you.
Harold, do you think you
could just have the courtesy
of including me
in the conversation?
Are you going
to have children?
What?
Daddy, that's not what we came
here to talk to you about.
Chris wants me
to address him.
This is what's on my mind.
You plan to have children
with my daughter?
Yes, I do.
We do. I do. Yes.
How do you intend
to protect them?
How am I going
to protect them?
Well, I'm gonna
get a gun, Harold.
I'm going to
amass an arsenal.
A lot of firepower.
How's that work for you?
Excuse me for a moment.
Wow, look at that.
It's worse
than this morning.
Yeah, I know.
Are we gonna talk
about this at all?
What?
Oh, well. There's a 10-day
grace period on firearms,
so I got lights.
And do we think that this is the right
thing to do to solve the problem?
Oh, I don't think
it's gonna solve anything.
But I'm gonna enjoy
the shit out of it.
Okay. Let me know
if you need any help.
Okay.
JAVIER: Man, I am so
totally burnt right now.
Late night?
Yeah, Connie kept me up.
Yeah, I seem to remember
something like that.
No, it's she wants
out of Boyle Heights.
You know, she's right, man.
You can't be living around the
people you got to be arresting.
Wife ever bust your chops
about moving up?
Jocelyn?
Yeah.
Never gave her
a chance, man.
I was busting
my hump for her.
Eight years
of double shifts,
all the overtime
I could drag down,
extra security jobs, taking all the
shit details nobody else wanted.
I grew up in South Central.
There's no way I was gonna
raise my kids there.
Now's the time to
get out, you know.
They'll be gone
before you know it.
It's the perfect opportunity.
That's why I'm
taking the exam.
What exam's that?
Detective exam.
Get off the street,
bump up a pay grade.
About 15 years,
and I'm out.
'Cause I don't really wanna be
doing this stuff when I'm...
I just don't love the
job the way you do.
Hmm.
DISPATCHER: Unit 51,
we have a 4-15 in progress.
Male suspect,
possible shots fired.
Pop the siren,
detective sergeant.
Unit 51, 10-4.
MAN: About time.
ABEL: Who called the cops?
He's got his wife and
his little girl in there,
yelling about how he
gonna kill them both.
JAVIER: Have any weapons?
Yeah, yeah, I think
he's got a gun.
He didn't open the door and I
wasn't staying to find out.
Okay, what
apartment number is it?
Apartment seven.
Straight back in the corner.
Left?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Right.
What's his name?
Damon Richards.
Keep these people back.
All right.
Get inside.
RICHARDS: What? I'm poor,
okay! What? Look at me!
Trying to say you're
better than me now?
WOMAN: I'm not talking
about my baby!
RICHARDS: You know what?
Forget him and you!
Please hurry.
RICHARDS: You can take
this damn baby away!
I don't need it!
Both of you!
You're just a strain
on my finances.
LAPD, Mr. Richards.
Man, get away
from my door!
Listen, my name is Abel.
I wanna know if your wife
and child are safe, okay?
Man, don't
worry about them!
Get away from my door!
Listen, Damon,
let's talk about this.
Man, we ain't gonna
talk about nothing!
We can play this any
way you want, okay?
Let's just keep talking,
all right?
Make sure everything
is cool inside, all right?
Gun!
WOMAN: Oh, my baby.
You okay?
No!
Damon! Stop!
Everything's gonna be okay.
Just stay there.
WOMAN: Officer, wait!
Please don't hurt him!
Stop!
He's a good guy!
Our guy's on the ground!
He's out the window!
Call for backup!
JAVIER: Hey!
Stay back! Sit down!
No! No!
Stay back!
WOMAN: Please! Please,
just let him go, Officer.
JAVIER: Unit 51 requesting
assistance. Man with a gun.
Give it up, Damon!
Come on, give it up!
Stop, Damon!
Stop right there!
Put the gun down!
End of the line! Hold it!
Don't come closer!
Don't come closer!
I swear to God I'll do it!
Okay, okay.
Okay, okay, okay.
Don't come closer!
Let's talk about this, all right?
Calm down, calm down, calm down.
I'll do it!
Take it easy. Take it easy, okay?
I'll do it. I'll do it!
We can talk about this.
All right?
There you go.
What are you doing?
Now stop bullshitting.
You wanna do this, do it.
Come on, stop playing. Stop bullshitting.
Go ahead, do it! Do it!
Come on!
What, you need some help?
Move your finger.
Move your finger!
No! No!
Give me the
goddamn gun then!
Up! Get up!
Look in my eyes.
Look in my eyes!
Is this gonna happen again?
No!
What?
No, sir! No!
I swear to God, no!
God ain't here,
you swear to me.
I swear.
I swear to you, sir!
Now, you be a man,
understand?
You take your responsibility.
I don't give a shit
what your situation is!
You be a father to
that baby, you got me?
JAVIER: Abel!
If I have
to come back here,
I'm gonna be the one doing the
shooting, you understand?
Yes, sir.
Detective Villareal.
JAVIER: Yes, sir.
Put some restraints
on this young man.
But do it gently, please.
Absolutely.
JAVIER: You heard him.
Come on.
Let's go. Come on!
Hey.
What are you doing?
You said any time.
Yeah, if your dad said
it was okay, Celia.
I have a feeling he didn't.
How old are you?
You're a very brave girl.
Make sure you ask
your dad next time, okay?
Yeah. Right.
Hey, can I ask
you a question?
Sure.
You got me.
So, in school there's
a lot of hooking up.
Okay.
And if a black guy
goes out with a white girl,
his boys are like,
"Dawg, you the shit."
Right.
But other way around
and they're on you.
"Sister" this,
"sister" that.
Is that what's
going on with you?
There's this guy.
And you like him?
Well, it depends.
How much
do I have to like him?
Um...
Well, if he's gonna
be your boyfriend
you should probably
really like him.
Especially if he's white,
because it may not be easy.
But you like who
you like, right?
Yeah.
All right.
Hey, what is this?
Destiny's Child.
Okay. I think
I've heard this.
You think?
It's nice. I like it.
No, I think I gotta
move to this. Wait.
Oh, my gosh!
I feel so old.
CELIA: Come on, take it.
LISA: No!
You can shuffle around a little bit.
Uh-huh.
Sure.
Come on.
You're not old.
You'll get it.
Come on.
No. No, no, no.
You are doing fine
for the both of us.
Come on!
Oh, my gosh,
you're a great dancer.
Come on, get down to it. Come on.
No way!
No! No. Absolutely not.
I'm not doing that.
Remember this one?
Who taught you that?
What do you know about that?
My mom did.
My mom taught me that.
Oh, my God.
I feel so old.
Come on!
Did I give you permission
to come over here?
LISA: Abel.
Answer me, young lady.
No, I'm just...
No, I did not give you, my daughter,
permission to come over here
because it matters to me
what you're learning
and who you're
learning it from.
Okay, I told her
she could come over
and swim whenever
she wanted to.
Oh, so what I say
doesn't matter.
That's not what
I meant, Abel.
No, no, no, no, no.
I understand where
you're coming from.
I need to be
fresh and liberal
and open to what other people think
and do, is that right, Lisa?
That's right.
Okay. All right, then.
Well, let's
all get crazy.
Let's just get
down then, huh?
What are you doing?
Forget the rules, huh?
There are no rules.
Abel...
We make them up
as we go along,
is that right, Lisa?
I am right, aren't I?
You've made
your point, Abel.
Whatever we wanna do,
that's all right, right?
That's enough.
How you say it, baby girl?
Listen, you made your point.
Let's get ill! This is sick!
Okay, Dad! All right!
This is dope! Let's keep it gangsta!
Holla!
What?
It's okay for you to parade
around in your underwear,
but not me, huh?
You know what that is?
That's hypocrisy.
That's a double standard.
There's no room in this
world for that anymore.
Didn't you teach
her that, Lisa?
I mean, you did teach her
everything you know, right?
No.
She knows a shitload more than you do.
Okay, Celia...
I beg your pardon?
Stop messing with my life!
Telling me what to do,
what to say, what to wear!
You don't know anything about
me, who I am or what I think.
You're just an old man with a
badge on and his pants off.
Okay, Abel,
that is not okay.
I'm sorry.
I'm not myself these days.
You know, I'm not
sleeping very well.
You have no right
to hit her.
Oh, let's you and me have a long
discussion about my parental rights,
why don't we?
Get off my property.
Or what?
You wanna call the cops?
Here. I'll tell you
who's on duty.
CHRIS: You okay?
You're not eating.
LISA: My stomach's
been funny all day.
You getting the flu?
Just tension.
Maybe he finally
got the message.
No lights tonight.
It's nice out here.
This place is
gonna look really sweet
by the time
we're done with it.
Just about when we're ready
to put it back on the market.
I'm sensing a theme here.
Be honest with me.
You wanna sell this place?
Do you?
Why, I certainly don't want
anyone else deciding that for us.
Not the guy next door.
Not your father.
They're not
the same person, Chris.
And you don't have to prove
anything to either one of them.
Come on, I know that.
Why wouldn't I...
Okay, we'll just let that be your
own little transference deal.
We won't actually talk
about that, I guess.
What?
That's what you
think this is?
Oh, don't get all "I know..."
Come on, you know exactly what I'm
talking about. Don't do this.
I am constantly taking shit
from black guys
about our relationship.
"Constantly."
Constantly?
Okay. Whatever. Lisa...
It just gets exhausting being on
the front lines all the time.
You have no idea.
What does that mean?
I'm just gonna go upstairs and
lie down and read my book, okay?
Everything meet
with your approval?
You always did keep
the place neat.
Just don't seem
to enjoy it much anymore.
You just said
something nice to me, right?
I mean, sort of?
Hey, baby.
You got everything?
Yup. I'm gonna ride the horse
this year, Aunt Dorrie.
Are you asking or telling?
Asking.
Well, then I think we can manage that.
Giddyup, partner.
And have fun, okay?
Okay.
Don't I get a goodbye?
See you.
Can we go?
So, what was all that about?
I don't know.
She's 15 and female.
You tell me.
Here.
You can give
this back to her
if you want her walking
around like a zombie child
for the next two weeks.
What is going on
with you, Abel?
I mean, you seemed
like you were fine.
Now all of a sudden, I don't
know, you seem different.
I am fine, and I've
always been different.
Never been better.
See you, guys.
Have fun.
You okay in there?
LISA: Uh...
I'm pregnant.
You sure?
Yeah.
I did three of them.
Should we call, or...
What about your pills?
I might have
missed a few. Maybe.
Well, either you did
or you didn't.
I did. Okay?
So... I did.
I thought we were gonna wait.
You don't always get to choose
this kind of thing, Chris.
Yeah, you do,
that's sort of the point.
Come on, you choose
to take birth control,
you can read the label and...
Come on, we had a plan.
Our plan was
to start a family.
I can't believe
you're not even
just a little bit
happy about this.
Oh, come on,
that's not fair.
Well, you know, I didn't...
This is not some
sort of sneak attack.
Right now, you want to
start a family right now?
Right now?
We just moved in!
I'm sorry. Is it not
convenient for you?
Oh, God! No, come on!
It's not about convenience.
It's a whole different life, you know?
And what life is that, Chris?
The one where you're
not married to me?
Come on, Lisa,
that's not...
I gotta go to work.
I'm late.
Bye.
What's going on, Captain?
Damon Richards.
You know him?
And you are?
Uh... This is Bronson
and Morgada. They're...
Internal Affairs.
Yeah. It's just
a procedural thing, Abel.
So, what about Richards?
We arrested him last week.
He took two shots
at me and my partner.
He's bringing a suit
against the department.
MORGADA: Brutality charges,
violation of civil rights,
as well as a personnel
complaint against you.
"Officer Turner used excessive
force, made threats against..."
I gave that
asshole a pass, Cap.
He took two shots at us.
You were verbally abusive and you
left him with three broken ribs.
Not to mention
shoving a gun in his face.
That is not accurate.
I talked to him.
I tried to educate the individual.
I never struck him.
If he was injured,
that happened when
he was out of our custody.
Look, this is
all bullshit, Abel.
But this is what we have
to deal with now, right?
So finish your tour today,
then take some time off in
lieu of disciplinary action.
All right?
How much time?
MORGADA: Until we tell you otherwise.
Because, you know, frankly,
over the last few years,
you have a number of question
marks on your record.
So I wouldn't push it.
You should be thinking retirement.
It's about that time.
and this is what I get?
What do you
think you deserve?
OFFICER 1: Heads up, heads up.
Don't stop on my account.
You don't wanna
hear it, Abel.
I heard nigger jokes before.
No, it's not that.
We're throwing a bachelor
party for Davis tonight.
And I'm not invited?
Yeah, sure you are.
We just thought that,
you know, it wasn't...
We thought it's
not your thing.
Tell you what, why don't you
bring it to my house, okay?
No civilians,
you can cut loose all night.
What about the kids?
Ah! They're doing
their two-week bit
with my sister-in-law
out in Lancaster.
Perfect timing.
You really want to?
My reputation's
on the line here.
Besides, I need
a good lap dance.
OFFICER 2: All right, let's do it.
OFFICER 3: Now we got a place.
OFFICER 1: We got a place.
LISA: What's going on?
Nothing.
Babe, do you hear this?
I don't believe this.
What time is it?
It's, like, 3:00
in the morning.
Where are you going?
To tell them to shut up!
No, you're not...
Lisa, wait. Wait!
No.
Wait! Wait, wait.
No.
Look, please.
Hey, let go of me.
I'll deal with it.
Oh, this you wanna
deal with, right?
The macho bullshit.
This you can handle.
Don't start.
MAN 1: Open the front door, man.
Open it!
JAVIER: I got it.
Yeah?
Hey, can you ask Abel
to come to the door?
What's the problem?
Well, we're trying to sleep.
We're trying to get
hammered, asshole.
MAN 2: Hey, man!
What's up?
MAN 3: Hey,
there you guys are, man.
What happened to you?
Hey! Who put you
on the VIP list?
Abel, what are you doing?
It's 3:00 in the morning,
we're trying to sleep.
Come on, Chris. I'm glad you came
over, we can bury the hatchet.
Let's get you a drink.
Fellows!
This is my next
door neighbor, Chris.
As you can see,
he is a Democrat.
Hey, we're
not biased here.
You can hug as many and any
tree you want. All right?
Here you go.
Whoo!
Fellow cop's
getting hitched.
Condemned man's last meal,
you know the deal, right?
CHRIS: Oh, hey,
congratulations.
Now can you just turn
the goddamn music down?
Is it disturbing you?
Come on, it's practically
breaking the fricking windows.
I bet you can't even
hear yourselves screw, huh?
Chris here got himself a little
dark meat over there, you know?
You know, you need
to be careful, neighbor.
You might not be
enough man for her.
Just busting your balls.
You know what they say,
"Once you go black..."
"You never go back."
There you go!
Besides, you don't wanna
piss these guys off, do you?
Whoo!
Look at that!
That's something, isn't it?
I'm massively aroused.
Oh, see, there you go.
You're doing that
Berkeley thing again.
You're saying one thing,
but you mean another.
That's irony, right?
I don't know.
I don't know.
You don't know?
If you went to Stanford you'd know.
Oh, come on, man,
lighten up.
Look, look. As soon as we
get through with the groom,
we'll turn the music down,
you go home, you get
some sleep, all right?
Bring him in here, yeah!
JAVIER: Bring him
in here, guys!
ABEL: Put it on him,
put it on him, put it on him!
STRIPPER: Show these cops.
Come on, now!
Hit him in the
face with them!
Beat him in the face
with those things!
Come on, now!
Kim!
Come on, now, give it up!
Thank you.
Oh, shut up.
Come with me.
Are you bad?
Take it down!
Now, look...
Don't let him
get away! No, no!
Now we talking!
Now we talking!
Get off me!
Grind it on him, baby.
Put it on him!
Put it on him!
Be careful now,
he's a married man!
He doesn't look
so married to me.
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Let him up, let him up! Let him up!
Whoo!
Nice pair, huh, Chris?
Little bit better than
Lisa's, though, right?
You do not wanna
do that. Believe me.
Get him out of here.
Get off me.
ABEL: It's a grown man's
playground over here, Chris.
Tell the wife good night!
JAVIER: Oh, shit! Bring
those strippers back here.
Come on,
don't let her stop!
No, now's the time.
Put them titties out.
Break those titties
out on him, baby!
Whoo! Yeah,
right there! Right there.
Hey.
Babe, what are you doing?
Where's my
goddamn camcorder?
Why?
I've gotta record
everything that bastard does.
Chris.
I'm gonna take
away his job...
Honey.
Pension...
His house...
Honey, what
happened over there?
God. You didn't forget.
What?
You didn't forget!
You stopped taking them!
What are you talking about?
Your pills!
What, you had to trick me?
That's the kind of
marriage you want? Fine!
I didn't stop taking them, I just
missed a few days, and then I...
I didn't do it on purpose!
Oh, really?
'Cause I find
that hard to believe!
I don't even know
who you are.
I'm your wife.
Are you?
'Cause I don't even
recognize you anymore!
Where is that damn thing?
MALE ANNOUNCER: A number of
wildfires are raging out of control
and have so far
burned 2500 acres
and destroyed 185 homes and
businesses all around the Southland.
The governor has declared
a state of emergency
in six counties in
Southern California.
40 thousand people have been
evacuated in the declared areas.
FEMALE ANNOUNCER:
Everything is just so hard.
I mean, no one want to lose any
houses, much less their own.
Right now two
additional fire teams
are gearing up to
hit the lines tonight.
We are joined right now by
Metro fire chief Greg Malio.
Greg, thanks
for being with us.
FIRE CHIEF:
You're welcome, Pamela.
ABEL: Be careful now,
he's a married man!
He doesn't look
so married to me.
Let him up, let him up!
Let him up!
CHRIS: That's great, guys.
Just put them all along the wall.
Why are we doing this?
It's good for the environment.
Trees make oxygen.
Well, you certainly
don't look pregnant.
That must make you happy.
What's going on, Lis?
I'm sorry.
I just can't stand this.
I hate my job.
I'm not even getting paid.
Then quit.
And do what?
I hate this neighborhood.
I miss my family.
Look, we knew
it was gonna be hard.
Maybe not this hard.
But we agreed that we'd...
No, I agreed to do
whatever you wanted
because I thought that we
were moving toward something.
We are.
It's your idea about what all
this is supposed to look like.
We just need to
get used to this.
"We" are now
all three of us.
I really need you
to start thinking that way.
I'll do whatever
it takes to make you happy.
That is all
I have ever wanted.
Hey. Hey!
Hey!
Hey! What are you...
Hey! What the hell
are you doing?
What? I can't hear you!
Turn that goddamn thing off!
LISA: Abel,
what's wrong with you?
Turn it off
and put it down!
Now, you didn't ask my
permission to plant these trees.
But they're hanging
over on my property,
so I don't need your
permission to cut them down.
Oh, come on!
Turn that goddamn thing off!
You wanna shut that
mouthy bitch of yours up?
She can say whatever
she wants, asshole.
Or what? You wanna come over here
and get busy, Chris? Come on!
Come on over.
Let's do something.
Abel, come on,
turn it off!
Shut it off, my ass.
LISA: What is wrong with you?
Come on over.
Oh, you want her
to be the man now?
CHRIS: Shut up!
Come on. Bring it on over here. Come on.
Come on, player, come on! Come on!
Come on, then.
That's what you want?
Think you're bad?
Yeah, yeah!
Yeah, that's right, I'm bad!
Yeah, put your
little saw down!
What do you got now, buddy?
Stop it. Honey. Honey! Honey!
Hey! Stop it!
Stop it!
You like that, huh?
Lisa, back up!
LISA: Have you lost your mind, Chris?
Lisa, get off.
Stop it! Stop it!
Get off of me!
Come on!
Chris, stop it!
Have you lost your mind?
ABEL: Real tough now, huh?
Oh, shut up. Put the
saw down and let's see.
Let's go! Come on!
Come on over here.
Come on!
There you go.
Run on in the house.
Pussy. Sugar britches.
Prick.
That's right!
Plant something
else over there,
see if I don't
cut that down, too!
ANNOUNCER: The flames are advancing
quickly in the hills surrounding
four counties
in Southern California.
In a moment,
we're gonna talk about
the drought conditions
across much of the country.
But first, we're gonna go
to where they're paying
a big price for
tinderbox conditions.
Hot enough for you?
I could use
another 50 degrees.
Anything else?
No, I'm good. Thanks.
Well, welcome
to the neighborhood.
Thank you.
ANNOUNCER: People here are
describing the harrowing scene
as they grabbed
whatever they could
of their precious possessions
and fled for their lives.
As the fires
roared out of control,
fanned by 65-mile-per-hour
Santa Ana winds...
Oh! Damn. I was trying
to get away from you.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
It's okay.
She's got a big old
Nothing's gonna jump off.
Nope. Had my drink.
There's no need
in you rushing home.
Lisa's not back yet.
That kind of woman, you gotta
let her cool off for a while.
Abel, Abel. Abel.
I don't care what
you have to say.
I don't care
what you think.
Just save it,
all right?
All your poisonous
race crap.
Okay. You know what?
Wasn't a good day for me.
Shit got a little
out of hand. My bad.
Sweetheart,
bring me my regular
and give him another whatever
it was he was having on me.
Okay? All right?
There you go, darling.
Thank you, baby.
Here you go.
Look at that shit.
Headed right for us, huh?
You know what today is?
No, how would you know?
Today's the third anniversary
of my wife's death.
When Marcus went
back to school,
she became
a home-care aide.
Mostly old people.
Alzheimer's patients,
stroke victims.
I don't know how
in the hell she did it,
but it made me kind of glad that
that's what she did, you know?
Sort of, you know, balanced
things out, you know?
How's that?
Well, you know, because
of what I do on my job.
Three years ago
to the day,
I get a phone call.
My wife's been in
a head-on collision.
Some guy high off his ass,
going 90 miles an hour the
wrong way on the 101 just...
They took her to
Hollywood Memorial.
She died
on a gurney in the hall
because somebody
forgot to tell them
she was the wife
of a police officer,
so they treated her
by pigmentation.
How do you know that?
Because I know things.
Well, I'm sorry.
Thing is,
what I been trying to figure out
for three years to this day
is why she was
with her employer,
who took a steering column
through the chest, by the way.
Where were they going
or coming from, Chris?
My wife and her white boss?
In the middle of
the afternoon on the 101
when she should
have been changing
some old Jew's Depends
down on Fairfax.
That really what you
wanna think about today?
Wouldn't you?
No, I wouldn't.
And why you telling me this?
What does this
have to do with me?
Nothing.
Except you and your
little chocolate drop
picked the wrong time
to move and the wrong place.
Ah! Whatever, Abel.
See, there you go. You white boys
always say that. "Whatever."
And then you go ahead
and just do your shit anyway.
What's that
supposed to mean?
That you think you can
take whatever you want.
And I hate that.
I hate it!
That's what it means!
Hey, sorry, sweetheart.
We just having
a heart-to-heart here.
Right, Chris?
You know what, Abel?
Fuck you.
Is that a
"we are the world" fuck you?
No. It's a special one,
just for you.
You've earned it.
We're not moving.
"Whatever."
They said it's
under control.
Yeah, well,
let's get this over with.
Then what?
I don't know.
SANG HEE: We feel safe
with Abel across the street
because there are very
bad people out there.
People who steal
and shoot you.
But we have a black
policeman living here.
Yes, it's very comforting.
ABEL: Annabelle, you leaving?
Hey, hey, hey.
Abel's famous cornbread.
Where's Celia and Marcus?
ABEL: It's their week to spend
with my sister-in-law.
Hi, Lisa. How are you?
They're probably out
there sharing tales
about what a hard-ass
their dad is.
SANG HEE: They're gonna be
grateful for the rules one day.
Yeah, I keep
telling them that,
but I don't think
they believe me.
Fellows.
Hey, what's the word, Abel?
Are we gonna be
okay down here?
Yeah. You know, they'll
stop it at the firebreak.
Never get through the pass.
Chris, how you doing?
Good.
Ooh!
Got his game face on.
Who's winning?
Johnny and Chris right now.
All right, well, I got next.
Great.
Hope this is not Division.
Turner here.
It's Darlington.
Yeah.
I'm in the crib, homey.
MAN: Nice shot.
All right, do your thing.
Nice shot.
Ain't nobody bitch,
you prick!
LISA: Babe, I'm just really...
I think I should go.
You sure?
You want me to go?
No, it's fine.
You accepted the invite,
you should stay.
All right.
I'll be home in a bit.
All right.
Come on. Pick up.
What's up?
Get out of the house now.
The wife is
on the way home.
You said they were away.
Bail your big ass
out of there right now.
Shit.
Chris?
Be nice.
Calm down.
Jesus.
No! Stop!
What is that?
Is that mine?
I'll check on it.
Wait. Wait.
That is mine.
Calm down.
Just hold still!
No! No!
Will you just calm down?
Chris. Wait!
Shit!
Chris!
What?
Stay there!
It's my wife!
Lisa?
Lisa?
Yo, playa!
What's up, man?
What the hell, dude?
Come on.
CHRIS: Hey, what are you...
CHRIS: Lisa?
Lisa?
God damn it.
Oh, shit.
No, no, no, no. Baby.
Don't touch her.
This is Officer Abel Turner
with the Valley Bureau.
I need a black and white and an
ambulance at 1100 Lakeview Circle.
Don't move her!
Look, I'm trying to see if she's alive!
Just talk to her.
Keep her calm till
the paramedics come.
CHRIS: Oh, Jesus.
Oh, God. Oh, God.
Oh, God, you're okay.
You're okay.
You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay.
ABEL: Come on. Shit,
where's your goddamn phone?
Abel.
MAN: Jesus Christ!
Everything's under control.
The ambulance is on its way.
MAN: You all right?
Fine.
ANNOUNCER: Dr. Cohen,
Mr. Mattson? The doctor
will see you now.
Okay, thanks.
CHRIS: Hey.
How you doing?
About three degrees
south of awful.
I don't even know
what that means.
So they checked you out
and you're okay.
Baby's okay.
Honey, that guy...
What happened?
Did they catch him?
Abel took care of him.
Abel?
Shot him.
In our house?
What was Abel
doing in our house?
We heard the alarm.
Ran over.
Right.
Hey, you need to rest, okay?
Yeah.
They're just gonna do
a few more tests
and we'll get
out of here soon.
Yeah, Turner here.
JAVIER: Hey, my man.
How's it going?
Detective.
How goes it with you?
Hey, man,
I just wanted you to know,
I told them you never
laid a finger on that guy.
Thanks a lot.
Appreciate it.
So when you coming back?
You know, it's hard
to say. I don't know.
Baby.
Yeah, well, we still got some
fine times ahead of us, man.
I'm not taking that test for, like,
probably a year, or whatever.
That's great.
Anyway, I just thought I'd
call and check up on you, man.
I saw your neighborhood
on the news
and you pour that whole reservoir
on it if you have to, okay?
You know I will.
Thanks for calling.
Bye.
Hey.
MAN 1: Go on through.
Right on through.
Keep going.
MAN 2: He's right.
They've been notified!
It's closed off.
Hey. Can we go up?
Only fire crew
and homeowners, sir.
We live on Lakeview Circle.
Hold on.
That's us.
That's our address.
I strongly suggest you pack what
you can quickly and evacuate.
Nobody knows where this
thing's headed right now.
Okay. Thanks.
Thank you.
MAN 1: All right,
clear a lane here!
MAN 2: No problem.
Let them through.
Hey.
You better think
about getting out of here.
I'll tough it out.
CLARENCE: Yo, what's up?
This is Clarence. Leave it.
Oh, God.
This is unbelievable.
Oh, my God.
Honey, we should
start packing.
I know. I know,
I know, I know.
Let's get going.
You know what? Go on inside,
I'm gonna go talk to Abel.
Um, baby...
No, I wanna thank him.
Right.
Abel.
Hey, how's your wife?
She's okay.
Thanks to you.
Look, that guy who broke in,
he deserved what he got.
And I'll tell anyone that.
You know, you better get on this
or get on back down the hill.
Yeah, we're just gonna
grab some things and...
Just wanna say thanks.
Okay.
Babe, what can I get
from downstairs?
Just the photo albums.
Okay. I'll be right back up.
CHRIS: Lisa!
Chris?
You got this all wrong.
Yeah, that's the
bad guy's phone.
He's been calling me, threatening
me, saying he's gonna hurt Celia.
Came to your
place by mistake.
You said yourself
I did the right thing.
And you were good
with that, right?
LISA: Chris!
Oh, God!
Stay down! Stay down!
Don't move,
you son of a bitch!
Lisa! Lisa, get out here!
Stay down!
Take the keys, take the
car, take this phone,
go down the hill
and get the police.
LISA: What do you mean?
He lied about everything!
He got the guy
to break into the house!
Just go, honey, go! Go!
Okay, okay! Okay, okay.
You son of a bitch!
LISA: Please help me!
Chris.
Chris, help!
CHRIS: Come on!
Chris! Chris, please help!
ABEL: You can't get away!
Neither one of you!
Stay back!
Give it up, Chris!
LISA: Get away from us!
You made your stand!
LISA: Chris!
Get back!
Come on!
LISA: Help me!
Please, no, no, no, no!
OFFICER 1: Put down your weapon!
Do it! Jesus Christ.
Put down your weapon!
He's trying to kill us!
I got it under
control, fellows.
It's all right, okay?
He's my neighbor.
He's having a bad day,
you know?
He's under a lot of stress.
He's lying!
Don't listen to him, he's got a gun!
I do not have a weapon! Look!
LISA: No, he's lying.
His wife was
attacked today.
I took the guy down.
You can call in and check that out.
All right?
Do not move any further!
He's just a little demented.
He went off and attacked me,
but he's okay. All right?
He's got a gun,
it's right behind his back!
Listen, I'm LAPD, guys!
I'm law enforcement like you!
I don't give a damn
if you're the Pope, asshole!
Do not move any further!
It's true, he's a cop!
See, Chris?
I'm the police!
You have to do
what I say, okay?
Put down the gun,
all right?
Sir, put the weapon down!
No, I will not!
Not till he puts his down!
He's got a gun, God damn it!
Chris, get down.
I do not have a gun.
Then turn around, Abel!
Then turn around!
OFFICER: Sir, drop the weapon!
Please. Please get down.
Come on!
If you point that
thing at me, Chris,
you better be
willing to use it.
Stay where you are!
This is what you want,
huh, Abel?
OFFICER: Sir, drop it!
This is what you want?
Chris, listen to me!
Stop it!
Listen to your wife,
asshole!
Chris, please stop!
Chris.
Did you listen
to your wife?
What?
Did you?
Chris, stop!
Maybe you should've listened to your wife.
Did you see it coming?
Shut up! You don't bring
my wife into this!
When she ran off on you?
You leave my wife out of this!
Did you see it coming?
Don't let her name
come out of your mouth!
Did you see it coming, Abel?
OFFICER: He's got a gun!
He's got a gun!
ABEL: Just shut up!
PARAMEDIC: Ma'am,
can you come with me please?
Just take your time.
Here we go.
Let's get you up
in here to see someone.
Watch your step.
Hey.
WOMAN: We're gonna move him
to the hospital now.
We've stopped the bleeding.
You should let me
take a look at you, miss.
No, I'm fine.
You sure?
Yeah.
How are you?
Three degrees south of...
I love you.
I know.
I love you, too.
The rest isn't important.
We're gonna have a family.
