Son, that's not so bad
Country is developing now these days
What kind of development?
Tap without water
electric bulbs without electricity
Roads with less
vehicles and more gullies
You can't walk on the
footpath because of the shops
Names are on the
waiting list of the train
Train will be cancel
if the ticket is confirm
Hospitals are without beds
lf the bed is available
then there is no one for care
Nobody going to solve your complaints
Ask the minister and
he recommends Bapu....

Call him at home and
he is in the bathroom
When he'll meet you he
ask for an application...
that will be in duplicate form
