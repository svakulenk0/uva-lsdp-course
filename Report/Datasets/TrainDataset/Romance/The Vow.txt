Wow, it was barely
an inch when we went in.
It's so beautiful.
It's good,
it's good, it's good.
I can't feel my fingers.
Thank you.
...do anything for love
You do not like this song.
You have to turn it off.
Oh, no, I won't...
I'm married to a cheeser!
Please, stop!
You love it.
Say you love it. Stop! Ow!
Stop it!
You love that song.
Oh, Leo.
Hey, I have this theory.
Mmm-hmm.
That a girl's guaranteed to get
preggers if she does it in a car.
What?
Mmm-hmm.
I have a theory, too.
My theory is about moments.
My theory is that
these moments of impact,
that completely turn
our lives upside down,
actually end up
defining who we are.
Thanks.
Next in line.
One of my absolute
favorite moments.
Oh!
You forgot your permit.
Yeah. Well, I just sort of come
here to enjoy the two-hour line.
The permit's
sort of a bonus.
The Art Institute.
You work there?
No, I'm a student.
I'm Paige.
I'm sorry. I'm Leo.
Well, thank you for this, Leo.
You know what, I noticed, in a
totally non-threatening way,
we have the same RPP zone.
Is that right?
Yup.
Hmm.
You have impressive
powers of observation.
Yes.
What's an RPP zone?
Residential
permit parking zone.
Oh.
That sounds intimate.
Yeah.
Okay.
What I was thinking is that...
I think we owe it
to ourselves, really,
to maybe get a drink,
out of respect for our
zone compatibility and all.
Okay.
Okay?
Mmm-hmm.
All right, okay.
After you.
Pick a hand. Pick a hand.
Pick a hand.
That one.
Here we go.
Mmm.
Mmm.
This is good.
Still I know you're
in the darkness shining
When the sun
starts coming through
Or when the cardinal
chides the moon
Let me know if you
need anything else.
That no one has to see
for us to prove
And everything
we'll ever see and do
Oh.
Oh.
Mmm.
Specks of gold
in the river running
When the sun
starts coming through
Or when the cardinal
chides the moon
That no one has to see
for us to prove
The rain pours down
in a million rivers
Did you just fart?
No.
Oh.
Maybe a little.
That is so twisted.
But totally romantic.
God, I'm so in love
with you, it's insane.
As you know,
your wife's CT scan
showed
intracranial hemorrhaging.
We purposely keep patients
with traumatic brain injuries
in a comatose state in order
to calm their systems
and allow the brain time to heal
itself while the swelling subsides.
And then we slowly
wean them off it. Now...
The thing is, each one
of us is the sum total of
every moment that
we've ever experienced,
with all the people
we've ever known.
And it's these moments
that become our history.
Like our own personal greatest
hits of memories that we play
and replay in our minds
over and over again.
Aren't you hungry?
Hey.
Hi.
What you doing?
Nothing.
Really?
No.
What's that?
Nothing.
Oh, nothing?
Food's ready.
Look, if you keep
feeding that fleabag,
it's gonna keep coming
back and I'm allergic.
Like you claim to be
allergic to cilantro?
I can't stand cilantro.
Exactly.
But you're not allergic.
Does anybody want strawberries I
bought at the farmers' market?
Buying groceries, bad sign.
What?
And we all know
what that means.
I like her.
She's like our mascot.
Thanks, I think.
I would rather have her than that
ferret you tried to make us adopt.
And she makes great coffee.
Let's keep her.
Thank you.
Have some.
Thank you.
"Movie"? I think you
spelled "movie" wrong.
No.
Told you.
Yes.
Mmm-hmm.
I vow to help you love life,
to always hold you
with tenderness,
and to have the patience
that love demands.
To speak when words are needed
and to share the silence
when they're not.
To agree to disagree
on red velvet cake.
And to live within
the warmth of your heart
and always call it home.
Wow, you set the bar
kind of high.
Did you write
your vows on a menu?
Yeah. Why?
I vow to fiercely love you
in all your forms,
now and forever.
I promise to never forget that
this is a once-in-a-lifetime love.
And to always know in the
deepest part of my soul
that no matter what challenges
might carry us apart,
that we'll always find the
way back to each other.
Do you take each other
as spouses forever?
I do.
I do.
Then by the power vested in me
by the State of Illinois, I...
Security.
I now pronounce you man and
wife and best friends for life.
Kiss! Run!
You had to run
for the weekend
You blew a kiss
to a goodbye and
I have one piece.
One piece.
It's...
It's not happening.
I don't...
Oh, my God.
You're gonna be fine.
Oh, my God. I'm gonna
have to call them.
I'm gonna have to call them
and tell them
that I can't do it.
Come to bed with me.
Come on. I know you wanna
come to bed with me.
Don't!
Oh, no, please, no.
Stop it!
Okay, okay, okay.
I think this one's
coming along fine.
I mean,
I know it's not finished,
but I'm already starting
to see a mood.
It's got like a darkening
curtain thing happening there,
and then a competing
light element, there.
Mmm-hmm.
It's abstract, but,
I mean, I don't know,
I kind ofthink
it's already powerful.
What?
You totally love me.
Yeah, I do.
Yeah.
I know because
this is my piece,
and that's the scrap pile,
which I'm now saving.
Hmm.
A moment of total physical,
mental, and every other kind of love.
Don't crowd her.
She's gonna be a little groggy,
so let's just
give her some space.
Hey.
It's so good to see you.
Paige?
It's okay.
You're in the hospital.
You were in a car accident.
You hit your head,
but you're okay.
We just kept you asleep
for a little while.
How do you feel?
My head hurts.
Yeah, well,
that's perfectly normal.
I'll get you
something for that.
Was anyone else hurt, Doctor?
Uh...
Paige,
you know who I am, right?
Yeah. You're my doctor.
Um...
I'm your husband.
Paige?
Mr. Collins? You said
things were very good.
A brain injury isn't like a
broken bone or a laceration.
Brains are
much less predictable.
Sometimes, due to the way the swelling
tissue presses against the skull,
it can cause some impairment.
Some impairment?
She doesn't remember me.
Even though she's awake,
the swelling
can cause confusion
or memory loss,
erratic mood swings.
What?
But that's normal.
That these moments of impact
define who we are.
was what if, one day, you could
no longer remember any of them?
Hi.
What are you up to?
Sleeping.
Right.
I brought you some clothes.
Thank you.
I'm kind of hungry.
Okay.
Come on.
So, I just wanted to verify
few things with you bout me,
about us.
Great.
So, we're married?
Yes.
Yeah.
And I have weird hair.
I think that's
taking a narrow view.
You said it takes
too long to straighten
and you'd rather use that
time to work in your studio.
My studio?
Why do I have a studio?
You're an artist.
Sculptor.
A really good one.
Right now, you're
working on four pieces
for the Tribune Tower lobby,
which is huge.
Everyone in town
wanted that commission.
But your show at the MCA's
so you won it.
What about my law degree?
I don't have a law degree?
I think you were
a few credits shy.
Last time I wanted
to be an artist,
I was in high school.
I think you need to
look at it like a win.
Traumatic brain injury is awin?
You're an idiot.
If she doesn't
remember who you are,
then she doesn't remember all
the stupid shit you ever did.
You can start over,
wipe the slate clean.
I'm just worried if
she doesn't remember you,
how's she going to remember
she's in love with you? What?
I was frankly a little stunned
she went for you
the first time.
If anything, you've
become less attractive.
You guys are
a great support system.
Seriously, though.
What if she doesn't
remember me?
Then what?
She's gonna remember you.
She's gonna remember all of us.
We're her family.
Yeah, you're right.
Excuse me. I'm looking
for my wife, Paige Collins.
She was right
over here yesterday.
Well, it looks like they moved
her up to the VIP floor.
That sounds expensive.
It's a donor's wing.
Just go down here
and take the elevator
to the second floor
and make a right.
Okay. Thanks.
Paige, your long-term
memory recall is intact
and I'm very optimistic the rest of your
memory is going to improve with time.
Mr. Collins,
I'm so glad you're here.
This is bizarre.
I'm Leo, Paige's husband.
Do you know how disconcerting
it was to hear second-hand
that my daughter had been
in the ICU for weeks
and we hadn't been told?
You should have called us.
I'm sorry.
You've never met my parents?
I don't understand.
Why haven't you met him?
So, Doctor, now what
is the next step?
The sooner she settles
back into her life,
her normal routine, the better.
Starting in a week or so,
I'm gonna recommend
that Paige see
a neural psychologist.
Okay.
Whatever she needs.
Therapy, specialists,
I'll make sure
she gets the best.
You'll come home where I
can take care of you.
Mom can make up
your old room,
and I can take
some time off work.
I don't mean to
be disrespectful,
'cause we really
appreciate that,
but you just heard
Paige's doctor say
that she needs to go back
to her normal routine.
Her life with me is
her normal routine.
Yes, but that's a life
she doesn't remember.
She will.
That's what her doctor
just got through saying.
No. What she said was that
maybe Paige will remember.
Now, why not
let her come home
and recover with
people that she knows?
And loves?
We're only trying to
do the best for Paige.
That's interesting, 'cause you
haven't even asked her once.
Well, no, but... What I
really need is for everyone
to just stop bickering!
Listen, none of this
needs to be decided right now.
No. Sorry.
I think you should
all head home, get some rest.
I'm sure everyone could use it.
How is it that
you're my husband
and you've never met my family?
You haven't spoken
to them in years.
Why would I ever stop
speaking to my family?
It all went down before we met.
And we never talked about it?
No, we did.
So?
For starters, you wanted
to move into the city
and go to the Art Institute.
And your father insisted
that you stay in law school.
He had some pretty strict views
on what you ought to be doing.
Things just
spiraled from there.
Okay. Look, what I remember
is being in law school
and being engaged to Jeremy.
I.. I don't know.
Paige.
Okay, babe, babe, just, just...
The best thing to do
at this point
is to go back
to your life with me.
You heard what the doctor said.
It's the best thing
for your recovery.
Okay, but I don't know you.
And I'm just supposed
to get in your car
and go and live at your place?
It's our place.
Without any proof of us
even being in love?
Other than our marriage?
People get married for all
kinds of different reasons.
Okay. Like?
Like for a green card.
I'm from Cincinnati.
Did I keep a journal?
No, not that I know of.
I guess this is
all he could find.
Oh, well.
It looks fine, honey.
I mean, we're
just going home, so...
It's horrible...
Paige?
I understand you're
finally leaving us.
Oh, yes, that's
what they tell me.
So, no driving until
I give you the say-so.
But other than that, I'm gonna
see you in four to six weeks.
All right?
Thank you so much.
Thank you, Doctor, for everything.
Thank you, Doctor.
Okay.
You ready? Let's go.
Wait, hold on.
I got a voicemail.
It's from before the accident.
You said you wanted evidence.
Okay, yeah.
Well, let's have a listen.
Hey, baby.
Ugh. I'm sorry,
I'm still at my studio.
I miss you so bad my sculptures
are starting to look like you.
I kind of need some Leo time,
if you know what I mean.
Love you.
I don't know, I guess
in listening back to it,
it doesn't
exactly prove anything.
No, no, it's...
It's cute.
I mean, I sound happy.
Okay, look.
Think about it.
You quit law school,
you broke off your engagement
and you moved into the city.
Those were all
choices that you made,
way before you even met me.
I think that
you owe it to yourself
to honor those decisions,
at least for right now.
This is a mistake, Paige.
I promise that
I will take care of her.
Please, come home with me.
Come home with me.
We'll figure this out together.
I guess I could just try it out
to see if it would
help my memory and...
Mmm-hmm.
I could always come home
if I change my mind.
I married him. It must
have been for some reason.
A guarded endorsement.
But I will take it.
I look like a freak.
I think you look great.
Where do we live?
On the north side.
Who's the president?
Of the country?
Yeah.
Obama.
The senator?
Yeah. You voted for him.
I did?
Welcome home.
After you.
Surprise!
Uh...
It's good to see you.
We were there every day
at the hospital,
but Leo didn't want us
to overwhelm you.
Yeah. They were.
Every day.
We really missed you.
I gather we're close?
I'm Sonia. And this
is my boyfriend Kyle.
Hey, Paige.
And this is Jim.
You look great, Paige.
And Lily.
Hey. What, were you, like,
working out at the hospital?
Hey, Paige.
And Josh.
I... Sorry, I... Excuse me.
Thank you all for coming.
I'm sorry it ended early.
It's all right.
Take care, Leo.
Are you okay?
What do you think?
I know. It's a lot to take in.
No.
A lot to take in
would've been coming home,
to a strange apartment,
with a man I don't know.
That would be a lot to take in.
But coming home to all of that,
plus a house full of people
pulling on me, and hugging
me, and crying in my face,
and talking about more shit
that I don't remember,
that's not a lot to take in,
that's total bullshit.
You're right.
It was only supposed
to be a few people.
Will you please just get out?
Paige, I'm sorry.
Are you honestly not
gonna leave me alone?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Of course.
I'm sorry.
Oh.
Oh, my God. Oh, my
mother's gonna kill me.
Good morning.
Good morning.
What?
You didn't knock!
It's habit. I'm sorry.
It's not like you haven't
seen it before. Come on.
This is not funny.
You should knock.
I'm sorry.
You look nice.
Really?
This is about the only piece of my
clothing I feel comfortable in.
That's mine, actually.
Oh.
No, it's fine.
What?
Huh?
You're looking at me like I'm
some kind of zoo animal.
Sorry, I don't know.
I'm just trying
to figure this out,
too, I guess.
You normally do all this?
This is my apology
for last night.
That was such a bonehead move.
I just wasn't thinking.
No, please.
I'm sorry. I...
I don't want you to
worry about me, okay?
Just go about your
normal routine and...
Do you work?
Do you have a job?
Yeah. Well, that's
if I'm still in business.
I own a recording studio.
Hmm. Cool.
So, what is my routine?
What do I do all day?
Well...
You usually get up
and make coffee.
All right. No, no, no. I got
it, I got it, I got it.
I did it this morning, I think.
And then you... Oh, no, don't.
That one's for me.
You don't eat meat.
Oh.
Then you check e-mails
and pay bills.
Okay.
Which I'm betting that you don't
remember any of the passwords
or account numbers, huh?
Mmm-mmm.
So, I guess I'll do that.
Okay.
And then you go down
to your studio.
I could take you down there,
show you what you're working on.
You know what? We don't have to
rehash everything right now.
I mean, just...
You go to work, and we can make
flashcards later, or something.
Are you sure?
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.
Okay. Well, your, look...
You got keys, phone here.
If you need me, all my
numbers are on there.
Okay.
Okay.
All right.
Yup.
Have a good day.
What's up, Lil?
Hey.
Fill me in.
That guy, Pointy Shoes?
He's a really bad kisser.
I don't think I'm gonna
keep him in rotation.
Okay.
Honestly, though,
it's actually been hell.
Yesterday, we were
somehow double-booked.
Too many clients,
that's a high-class problem.
Yeah, but with only one studio,
it's pretty impossible
to take on both gigs.
Right? So, Dune Advertising
weren't flexible
and they rebooked
over at Soundspace.
Wait? What? Come on.
That's a big account.
They should always
be prioritized.
You know that.
Yeah. Look...
I can't run the sessions and
handle account services, right?
This isn't
a one-woman operation.
It's not like
I flaked or something.
I know, I get it.
I'm not mad.
I'm just... I'm just
saying shit's slipping.
Well, I'm here now.
How's she doing?
She's getting there.
She's...
Look, thanks.
It'll be fine.
Okay. Good.
So, you'll be
at the 3:30 pitch?
Of course.
I'm going to head home, then
change, and check on Paige,
but I'll be there.
Okay.
to always hold you
with tenderness,
and to have the patience
that love demands.
and to share the silence
when they're not.
To agree to disagree
on red velvet cake.
And to live within
the warmth of your heart
Did you write
your vows on a menu?
Weird.
I vow
to fiercely Jove you
in all your forms,
now and forever.
I promise to never forget that
this is a once-in-a-lifetime Jove.
And to always know in the
deepest part of my soul,
no matter what challenges
might carry us apart,
that we'll always find the
way back to each other.
Oh, hi.
Hi.
Could I have a...
One of these?
You don't want the usual?
I have a usual?
That would be perfect.
I'll have the usual.
All right.
Here you go.
Thank you.
Thanks.
You know you can't keep
letting it get you down
And you can't keep dragging
that dead weight around
Paige?
If there ain't
all that much to lug around
Better run like hell
when you hit the ground
Can I help you?
Could I borrow your phone?
Hello?
Hey, Lil.
No, I know it's 3:30.
Look, I can't. I can't.
I gotta find Paige.
No, no. I don't know.
Make it up.
I'm sorry. I didn't
know who else to call.
Get in, sweetheart.
Get in.
Oh, sweetie.
Yeah You all right?
Hey.
Hey.
Where you been? I was starting
to get a little worried.
Thought something
might've happened to you.
Sorry.
I was lost, physically.
Mentally, I guess, as well.
Well, you should've called me.
Yeah, I forgot the phone
and I don't know
your number by heart,
so I called my mom
and we made a day of it,
which was great.
She invited us
for dinner tonight.
Dinner? Okay.
You don't have to go.
Well, you're not allowed to
drive, so I do have to go.
But that's not the point.
You know, maybe I'm gonna
wake up tomorrow
and remember everything,
but right now they're the
only thing I'm sure about.
Okay.
We'll go.
Okay.
Okay.
Are you gonna change?
Mmm. Mmm-hmm.
Changing.
It's just a left up here
at the Caldwells',
and then a right
at the cul-de-sac,
and we're six houses
in on the right.
Oh, the Prestleys got
a new mailbox. So cute.
You know, this arrangement
doesn't exactly say,
"I'm sorry that
we haven't spoken,"
"but now that
I have a brain injury,"
"maybe you can
overlook it."
You're right.
We should've got them
forget-me-nots.
That's funny.
Actually, that is funny.
So, well, you've
already met my parents,
but my dad will say to call him
Bill, but he prefers Mr. Thornton.
And my sister's name is...
Gwen.
I know a lot about
your family, Paige.
Right. Yeah.
We're married.
You know?
Oh, my God, you're engaged!
I know.
Wow.
You guys make a really cute couple.
Oh, thanks, Paige.
Wow.
It has been forever.
Has it?
The weird thing is that everyone
looks a little bit older.
Really? Yeah. You,
especially
Oh, I'm... I'm so happy
to have you back.
In honor of Paige being home,
I made your favorite dinner.
Filet mignon.
Oh, please. Please. Sit down.
Before we start, I think this
evening deserves a toast.
Darling?
Well, I... I would like
to drink to my family.
I am so fortunate to have these
three beautiful women in my life
and, when we're all together,
that fortune just multiplies.
Paige, honey, welcome home.
To family.
To family.
So, Leo,
what about your family?
Do you see them often?
No.
Oh, that's a shame.
Both my parents are dead.
It's just Paige.
She's my family now.
And what kind of
work do you do, Leo?
I just opened up my own
recording studio downtown.
Paige actually convinced me
to turn it into a business.
I did?
Yeah.
Isn't that sort
of a dying field?
No, I just mean,
can't people record things
on their computers at home
and they sound just as good?
Ryan.
What?
Look, the records that I like,
they have life
and warmth and soul.
Like the slapback on Scotty
Moore's guitar on Mystery Train.
Look, you're not gonna get
that in your computer.
You're gonna want a live room,
you're gonna want to bounce to tape.
You're gonna want real musicians in
a room, vibing off of each other.
You...
I guess, to answer your question,
it may be a dying field
and you can record
high-quality stuff at home.
But, I mean, come on,
you can't get the Sun
Sessions on your laptop.
Wow.
Wow.
Wow.
Wow.
I heard everyone is
gonna be here tonight.
This kind of thing might be a
little too much for Paige.
Oh, no,
I'm good here, actually.
Isn't that Diane Chain?
Yeah, we don't really
hang out any more.
God, you have been
away a long time.
Oh, my God!
Good luck, man.
Hi.
Hi!
Sorry. Leo, these are my
friends from high school.
This is Shana, Carrie, Lizbet.
Hi.
What about me? I don't
get an introduction?
Hi.
Hi.
Sorry, this is...
Jeremy.
It's been a long time.
Has it?
It doesn't seem like it.
You haven't changed a bit.
I'm not sure if she
mentioned it. I'm Leo.
Hi.
Paige's husband.
Right.
I'm gonna grab a drink.
You guys want anything?
Disaronno sour?
I'll have a blueberry mojito.
Really?
Yes, I remember.
Oh, my God, Paige.
Do you remember when we
were in the ninth grade,
and we were getting ready
for the Christmas dance,
we were curling your hair...
We ended up
burning off half your hair.
I totally remember that!
And didn't I wind up having
to wear a beret to the dance?
No, no, no,
that was the...
It was like she was
some sweater-set wearing,
mojito-drinking
sorority girl.
Like a Stepford wife?
Yeah, basically.
She was even flirting with
Jeremy right in front of me.
Ex-fiancé Jeremy?
No, no. No.
In her mind,
it's current fiancé Jeremy.
Which is why it was
probably pretty annoying
to have her stranger husband
cock-block her all night.
That is a lot to
get my mind around.
So, what turns her on?
Paige?
No, her mother.
Yes, Paige.
Like, in bed?
Oh, my God, Leo.
What?
It's private. It's...
I don't know.
It's... It's kind of a
between-me-and-her kind of thing.
Hey, I'm not gonna judge.
She likes being tickled.
Seriously?
Wow. Thought you
weren't gonna judge.
I'm not. I'm just... I...
I don't care if
you're into kink.
It's not like that.
It just breaks her down
when she's stuck in her head.
Okay.
You should give that a shot.
Seriously?
Yeah. What do
you have to lose?
Hey, Lisa.
Hey.
Paige?
Because I've been dealing with these
people forever and I know they have...
Something important
just popped up.
I'm gonna call you
right back. Okay.
Hi.
Hi.
Please.
So, you remember
that time at the lake,
when you told me you'd always
have my back, no matter what?
The night in the boathouse.
Mmm-hmm. Yeah.
Yeah.
So, can you please tell me
what went down with us?
Only you, Paige,
can dump a guy,
then come back
and demand answers.
So I dumped you?
A cruel, hard,
pre-wedding dumping.
Why?
Well, that's a question
that I and all of my friends
and the two rebound girls,
yeah, we'd all
love an answer to.
Come on, seriously.
I must have had
some kind of reason.
You...
You... You changed.
You talked differently,
you dressed differently.
You weren't sure
about law school any more.
And you definitely weren't
sure about me any more.
Did I give you your ring back?
Yeah, you did.
Who has that now?
No one yet.
But I've been with Rose.
You remember?
From Gwen's class.
I've been with Rose
for about a year now.
I couldn't wait forever, Paige.
You couldn't have anticipated
that I'd have a brain trauma
and forget our break-up
and come waltzing
into your office
demanding answers?
What's wrong with you?
I'm sorry. I'm gonna
let you go back to work.
Sure.
Sorry.
I'm sorry.
I was not expecting that.
Habit, I guess.
I honestly didn't even know where I
was headed until I found myself here.
It just seems
so ridiculous to me
that I shut everyone out
for five years.
It just doesn't feel right.
Hey.
Hey.
How was your day?
Uh...
It was fine.
I'm just happy to
be home with you.
Sorry about the mess here.
No problem.
What, are you collaging?
Do I collage?
No, not that I remember.
No, you know,
I was just so inspired
just seeing
everybody last night.
To collage?
All those memories just
came flooding back to me,
so I thought I'd make a
timeline, you know, of my life.
That's... That's great.
That's a great idea.
Yeah.
I kind of rummaged through some of your stuff.
I hope you don't mind.
It's fine. It's fine.
What's mine is yours.
I even have a certificate from the
State of Illinois to prove it.
Yes, I found that.
It's in the lost years.
See, I started over here.
I found some family photos, me when
I was little, stuff like that.
That was easy to put
into chronological order
because I remember that stuff.
That's good, right?
Yeah, yeah. I guess so.
But what I've been trying to do
is pinpoint
the last memory I had
before everything
just went blank.
How's that going?
I think I was
at the Macaroni Grill,
and I was asking them if they had
those special toasted ravioli.
And I don't
remember the answer.
That's it, that's all,
that's my last memory
before I woke up in a hospital.
Oh, no. How are we ever gonna
know if they had toasted ravioli?
God, this is not happening.
It's okay.
This is not happening.
Okay? No, no, no, no,
please don't do that.
What Come on.
What are you doing?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. Was that...
That was one of our things?
Yeah, kind of. It...
I'm sorry...
No. You don't have
to say it.
You don't. I get it.
It'll all come back.
We just have to keep
doing what we're doing
let you fall back
into your life.
It'll
all sort itself out.
Yeah.
About a dozen
downtown businesses were boarded up...
About a dozen
downtown businesses were boarded up...
Glass littered sidewalks,
following two nights of pro tests
Hey.
There were few people
on the street.
I think I'm ready
to see my studio now.
Will you show it to me?
Yeah.
Come on.
This is the first studio
you've ever had to yourself.
It's a cool space, huh?
Wow.
You weren't sure you liked
it at first, though.
Until you had this idea
to burn some smudge stick
that you bought from some guy
on the corner of Diversey.
We lit this thing
and we started waving it around
until we realized that it was
just some old pieces of lettuce.
So, we're waving around burning lettuce.
I don't know.
But it must've done
the trick, though,
'cause after that, I couldn't
get you out of here.
You would come in
and crank your music,
and you'd get lost
in a project,
and I'd have to come and remind
you that it was night-time.
This is one of your pieces
for the Tribune Tower series.
What is it supposed to be?
I'm not sure if
you even knew yet.
But come here.
I...
Here, just help it figure
out what it wants to be.
Okay.
I don't...
I don't really know
how to use this thing.
Sure you do.
Wait, hold on.
That's better. Come on.
Just try it.
It might be fun.
Can you just turn down
the music, please?
I swear you used
to listen to it
so much louder than this.
I never could understand
how you would just
be able to focus...
I have a clinically bad,
goddamn headache!
Please turn down the music!
I'm trying to help you!
But I am not your punching bag.
We don't speak to
each other like this.
This is hard for me,
too, Paige.
Paige?
Yeah?
Hey.
Hey.
I passed by that
little Portuguese bakery
that you love on the way home,
and I got us some...
Is somebody here?
Yeah.
Leo.
Hey.
My sister's just up to her
eyeballs with this wedding stuff,
and we've got the
engagement party coming up.
And we all thought Paige could
come home and help her out.
It just seems like
the right thing to do,
to be there for Gwen.
Okay. But what
about your life here?
What about all the work
that you haven't finished?
I talked to the people
at the Tribune.
And they were really understanding
about the accident,
and Dad's gonna
loan me the money
to pay back
their advance, so...
I don't know.
I just... I can't do it.
You just come out
when you're ready, honey.
Okay, thanks, Dad.
I'm sorry. It's just
until after the wedding.
I just want you to
be careful, okay?
Well, I'm not joining a cult.
I'm just going to
stay with my family.
I know, but...
But what?
Can I at least give you
an awkward hug?
So, how are you feeling?
Mmm. I feel fine.
Yeah? No dizziness,
disorientation, sleepiness?
Nope.
Great.
Well, I'm very happy, and
your CT scan looks excellent.
Oh.
What a relief. Well...
So, your memory recall,
anything?
Not really.
No, huh?
That's not normal, is it?
Listen, when it comes to the
brain, nothing is normal,
because no two brain
injuries are the same.
Paige seems
perfectly herself again.
It's wonderful.
Mrs. Thornton, could I just talk to
Paige alone for a moment, please?
It's okay, Mom.
I'm... I'm good.
All right.
Thanks.
Paige, do you want
to regain your memory?
Yes.
Because some patients fear
that when their memory
comes back,
so will the memory
of the trauma,
but mercifully
that's rarely the case.
Oh, no, that's not it.
I'm... I'm...
I'm not afraid of the accident.
So, what are you afraid of?
I guess I just...
I don't know. It's...
I mean, what if I don't
like the life that I had?
Or what if I like it too much?
I...
I just don't know.
I only did one psych rotation,
so this may be terrible advice.
But I think you have to
try and fill the holes.
You can still decide
you want a different life,
but if you don't at least
open yourself up
to remembering,
I'm afraid you're gonna live
in fear of your own past.
Hey. I'm here.
These guys are?
Knife Skillz, with a Z.
Right.
Okay, Mikey, sounds amazing.
Let's just go for it.
The bass line is one note.
Just one note.
Okay, cool.
Take two.
Wow.
You look different.
Yeah. Going for
a Kanye kind of thing.
I'm gonna say
more Michael Bublé,
but, whatever, it's still good.
Hmm.
So... I'm gonna be
in and out for awhile.
Sounds really good, Mikey.
Let's just take it from the top
or the middle or wherever.
You know what? People come
here to work with you, okay?
I mean, I'm doing my best,
but you gotta be here.
I know.
But if Paige is in Lake
Forest with her family,
that's where I gotta be.
I gotta make my wife
fall in love with me again.
Oh, you found each other.
Hi!
Let's see it.
It's good to see you.
All right, take it easy.
The countdown's on, man.
Hey, man.
One week left of
your former life.
How you feeling?
I feel pretty good, actually.
I mean, I do get a little dizzy
if I think about it
for too long, but...
What?
No, honey, it's like
a good dizzy. It's like...
It's like panic or excitement.
Well, panic and excitement
are different.
Honey, there's gonna
be 400 people there.
Right.
Hey, do you also have a little
tingling in your fingers?
Yeah. Is that bad?
Do you listen
to Radio-head?
Uh-huh.
Thom Yorke, he talks about
dizzy spells all the time.
He says when
his fingers tingle,
that's how he knows that he's
creating something genius.
And then he gets
so amped up playing
that he almost passes out.
Ryan, it sounds to me like
you're on the verge of genius.
That's cool, man.
Cheers.
Ooh, Ryan, I have someone
I want you to meet.
Mom, you listen
to Radio-head?
Yeah. Why wouldn't I?
So, is that true?
Mmm-hmm.
Paige?
Hey, Leo.
What?
Your hair.
It looks so different.
You look beautiful.
Thank you.
Okay, look, so I've been
thinking about something.
Okay.
What's your favorite book?
It's probably not
what you remember.
That's fine.
That's not the point.
Okay. The Beach House
by James Patterson.
No, really?
Yeah.
Okay. The Beach House.
Okay, if it was great, you probably
loaned it to somebody, right?
Yeah. Gwen, I think.
Okay, and you probably
said to yourself,
"God, I wish I was the
person that hadn't read it,"
"so that I could experience
it all over again."
Yeah, I guess so.
That's how I think
we should look at this.
What?
You can't remember how we met.
Mmm-hmm.
And you can't remember
how we fell in love.
And in a way, yeah, that sucks.
But it was
the greatest time of my life.
I just thought
how cool it would be
to get to experience it
all over again.
Like reading your favorite
book for the first time.
Exactly.
Got you.
Which is why I want to
ask you out on a date.
A date?
Like two people that are just
meeting for the first time.
Jeremy...
Yeah, I'm sorry.
Well, I don't know.
I mean, you know,
we've got
the wedding coming up.
But if we go out before then,
you might still be able
to take me as your date.
I can't promise anything,
but I'll put in
a good word for you.
All right.
So, I have an idea, but it
involves going into the city.
You okay with that?
Yeah, that's fine.
I just have to be back
by 10:00 in the morning.
Oh, my God.
What?
First date and you're already
inviting yourself
to stay the night?
I'm just a little
scandalized is all.
No, I just meant...
Don't worry.
I'll have you back tonight.
If you wanna
stay the night, that's...
I mean, it's...
If you want...
You wanna just see
how it goes? All right.
Should we get out?
We don't have to.
Is this the part of the date
where I find out
you're not actually my husband
but some crazy stalker,
and you're gonna strangle me
with my purse?
No. This is
the exact parking spot
where we first met.
Oh.
I'm gonna take you on
a little retrospective of us.
Mmm.
That is so good.
You ready for dessert?
Dessert?
Hmm.
We just had waffles.
Mmm-mmm.
This is dinner.
These are dessert.
Well, how do you know
what flavors they all are?
It's like a chocolate Russian roulette.
It's part of the fun.
We'd be surprised
by the ones we liked
and the ones we didn't.
Okay.
And...
You don't like it?
I do not like that one.
Here. Try this one I think
you'd like this one.
Oh?
Mmm.
Told you.
Okay.
Your turn.
Are we going shot for shot?
Wait till you try
their hot chocolate.
We would come here
whenever it snowed.
Are you trying to make me
diabetic or just fat?
No, I...
You got a...
It's still in your hair.
So, we come down here at
night and look at the lake?
That's not exactly what we do.
I... I'm not...
I don't...
No, no, it's not that.
We said we'd go in
once a month every month,
and we haven't done April yet.
We started in July.
Why? Why would we do that?
We were at
this spaghetti place,
and we had this waiter
and he said he did it.
And he was, like, 80.
So we thought we could.
Yeah.
Now, we said
no wetsuits, but...
You're serious.
...for you, I guess
I'll make an exception.
All right. Turn around.
Turn around.
Okay.
Wait. No wetsuit?
We said no wetsuits, right?
Yeah.
Oh, no.
No, no. No, no!
Come on.
Thank you.
Heat, heat.
My left eyelid's frozen shut.
I can't feel my fingers.
I can't feel them.
I don't know what your
Paige did on a first date,
but with me, you're
only getting to first base.
Okay.
I'm sorry.
I can do better.
My... My lips
are still numb.
It's nice.
Second base, tops.
This is perfect.
Thank you for coming out
with me tonight.
I had a really nice time.
I've missed you.
I miss our life together.
I miss being with you.
I love you.
I should probably get inside.
Good night.
Good night.
Hey.
Hey. I didn't know
you were gonna be here.
Were you out with Jeremy?
No.
I was with Leo.
I like him.
Yeah.
Me, too.
Are you okay?
Paige, I've never seen
you like this before.
I mean, is this
crying thing the new you?
Because it's bizarre.
I don't know.
I don't know what's me.
I have a tattoo.
And I'm a vegetarian, too.
Look, it was just like it used to be.
It was better, actually.
Everything that
I fell in love with
about Paige is still there.
You know, to you,
I'm sure it seemed
like a confirmation
of your love
or your marriage, right?
But to her,
it probably seemed more
like a really good first date.
Exactly. Which is why
I think you've gotta wait
the requisite three days
before you call.
I gotta wait three days
to call after a date
with my own wife?
At least. This is a unique case.
Maybe longer.
It can't be longer.
I'm gonna see her
on Saturday at the wedding.
I'm telling you,
it was so obvious.
Even with all this crazy shit going on
around us, we still belong together.
Obvious to her or to you?
To both of us.
Oh. Oh, Paige?
Yeah?
We have to start writing out
those place cards after we eat.
Yes.
Before you start on that,
I have a little surprise
for you, Paige.
Oh?
You know Ray Porter, right?
He taught constitutional law
at Northwestern.
He and I were on
law review together.
We've known each other
He is the dean of
the law school now.
Okay.
And they're gonna
let you back in.
What?
Well...
I didn't even apply.
I took care of it.
This is crazy.
I feel like I'm getting
a free do-over in life.
You look like
you could use a drink.
I've already had several.
But you haven't had this.
All right.
I'm glad we're
having a moment alone.
I haven't gotten a chance
to really talk to you, Leo.
Yeah.
Yeah, cool.
Congratulations.
That's nice.
Yes, it is.
I've been thinking.
And I think that it's probably
time to let us take it from here.
Take what?
Things with Paige.
Look, I know she didn't have
health insurance because
you chose to live
in a certain way,
and I know you must
be drowning in debt.
But I also know
away out of this.
What's that?
Divorce her.
The bills have
only just begun, Leo.
Mr. Thornton, I don't think
this is the time
or the place to discuss this.
Fine. If you don't care
about losing your business,
which, clearly, you don't,
what about Paige?
What about doing
what is obviously
the right thing for her?
And you know
what's right for her?
As a matter of fact, I do.
You're such a hypocrite.
What did you say?
If you're such
a family man, how come I...
I never once saw
you come and try
to put things back
together with Paige?
You're such a coward.
Hey, can I introduce
you around a little bit?
Can't feel good to
be the odd man out.
I'm not the odd man out.
All right.
If you say so.
You just seem a little creepy
over here all by yourself.
I'm just waiting
for Paige, man.
All right, well,
best of luck with that.
You like this, right?
I'm sorry, like what?
Paige leaves you behind.
She goes and has
this life without you,
with some guy that no one gets.
And now you get to
see her reject all that.
I mean, I like it
a little bit.
Yeah?
Well, let me
tell you what I like.
I like the fact
that Paige told me
everything about you, Jeremy.
Okay.
She told me that
when she was with you,
she would wake up
at night in a panic,
thinking,
"Is this all there is?"
Wow.
She told you everything, huh?
Mmm-hmm.
Did she tell you
that she threw herself
at me the other day?
Did she tell you that?
Or did she stop
telling you everything
when she forgot
who the hell you were?
Look, I get why
you're being such a dick.
You obviously love her,
and you think you're
gonna get her back.
But the thing is,
she outgrew you.
What makes you think
that won't happen again?
Thank you for that advice.
I will mull it over while
I'm in bed with your wife.
Leo!
Paige, wait!
What the hell
were you thinking?
I don't know. That's
a really good question,
because I have been
driving myself insane,
making a complete ass
of myself!
Literally trying
everything possible
to try to save what we have.
And you've been throwing
yourself at Jeremy.
That's not fair.
It's not fair?
I see the way you look at him.
I know,
because you used to
look at me that way.
Leo, I...
No, I think we need to
start being realistic.
Your memory's not coming back.
The fact is that
I'm still just a stranger.
I'm not trying to hurt you.
But I'm just...
I'm so tired of
disappointing you.
I know.
I'm so sorry.
I'll apologize
to Gwen and Ryan.
Oh, God, no, it's fine.
Wedding disasters have a way
of turning into great stories.
Eventually.
How do you look at
the girl you love
and tell yourself
it's time to walk away?
Leg?
I hope one day I can love
the way that you love me.
You figured it out once.
You'll do it again.
Shit.
You're here, not there.
Are you okay?
I'm done.
It's over. I give up.
No, you never give up, Leo.
No, if we were
meant to be together,
we would be together.
I was just thinking
about the first time
that we went to
that Greek restaurant
on the corner.
There was
this big banner saying.
"Now Serving Soup,"
and I just started to
go on and on.
about all the obstacles
that the owner
must have overcome
to achieve his lifelong dream
of serving soup.
And then...
And when I was finished...
She didn't say anything
for a few seconds
and she just...
She just sort of exhaled it.
It was almost to herself.
"I love you."
And it just hung there.
It was the first time
she had said it,
and I didn't
even wanna respond.
I just wanted to
keep hearing it.
That was two weeks
after we met.
It only took her two weeks
to fall in love with me before.
She doesn't love me.
Sign here, please.
Come here, little buddy.
Diane?
Hey.
How are you?
Listen...
I know it's been years.
I was away for awhile.
I never had a chance
to apologize.
I was just going through
a really weird time,
but your dad ended it
as soon as your mother
confronted him about us.
And I just always
wanted you to know that.
I don't mean to
open old wounds, but...
I just really needed
to say that I'm sorry.
No, I'm really glad
that you said something.
You were always
a really good friend.
I just wish I could've
returned the favor.
The lilies were bad,
so I got sunflowers instead.
I wanted to tell you.
You knew?
You knew the whole time?
I'm sorry.
Don't talk to me.
Paige. Paige. Paige!
Hey, where have you
been all day, stranger?
Hmm?
Paige?
I ran into Diane Chain
at the store.
That's why I left, isn't it?
Because I found out.
Mom, I barely
even know who I am,
and then it turns out
you're lying to me,
and you've used my accident
to rewrite the past?
I couldn't bear the thought
of losing you again.
Do you have any idea how
betrayed I feel right now?
I'm sorry, Paige.
We were happier than
we'd been in years.
Oh, Mom!
We finally had you back again.
Back on your terms!
No!
Yes, as usual!
Paige!
He cheated on you
with my friend!
How could you stay with him?
I...
I was going to leave.
I was.
I was all ready to leave.
And then one afternoon, I
was all alone in the house,
and I started looking at
all the photographs of you
and your...
And your sister.
And the house seemed
so full of all of us.
We were a family, Paige.
And I realized
in that moment that
that was the most important
thing in the world for me.
And I couldn't, I couldn't,
I could not go.
So, you just WASPed it away?
No.
I chose to stay with him
for all the things
that he had done right
and not to leave him for the one
thing that he had done wrong.
I chose to forgive him.
Maybe Leo was right.
Maybe I can't figure out who I
am and be around all of you.
I still feel a little chilly.
I don't care what you say.
That's fine.
Paige.
I'm sorry.
Is everything okay?
Look, you two obviously need
to talk, so I'm just...
Okay.
Talk to you later.
All right, bye.
I'm... I'm sorry.
What happened?
Can I ask you something?
Yeah.
You can always ask me anything.
Did you know
about my dad's affair?
Yeah.
I knew.
Why didn't you tell me?
There were so many times
that I almost did.
But to drive you away
from your family again?
That just felt wrong.
I wanted your love, I...
Just not like that.
I wanted to earn it.
I just don't think I can
afford to lose them right now.
So don't.

Supreme Court,

of Eldred v. Ashcroft...
Thanks for lunch.
Actually, there's something
that I wanted to tell you.
Okay.
Things are over with Rose.
I ended it, Paige.
No. Why did you do that?
I thought you were
getting engaged...
We were,
but that was before you.
No, that was after me.
Okay, it was after you,
but it was before this you.
It was before
the old you came back.
Jeremy, I'm not the old me.
I'm just me.
I'm just the me that's trying
to figure it out still.
I understand,
but, whichever it is,
the old you or the new you,
I don't care.
I know you remember
what we were like together.
I know you do.
This is our chance
to get that back.
What we had was wonderful.
Those were wonderful memories,
but those were...
Those are my only memories.
Everything after you is erased.
I...
I have to discover what it's like
to be without you, on my own.
Are you sure you don't remember
breaking up with me
the first time?
Why?
'Cause it sounded
a hell of a lot like that.
Let's go.
Hey.
I was looking all over.
I was worried when I didn't
see you outside the library.
So...
How's that intellectual
property class going?
Actually, I wanna
talk to you about that.
I've decided to
leave law school.
And I'm gonna get
an apartment in the city.
It's happening
all over again, isn't it?
Damn it, Paige.
I've made a lot of mistakes.
Dad, this isn't about you
or anything you've done.
This is about me,
who I want to be, who I am.
Just tell me what to say,
so I don't lose you again.
You won't.

and wait until
the next collision.
I vow to
help you love life,
to always hold you
with tenderness,
and to have the patience
that love demands.
and to share the silence
when they're not.
To agree to disagree
on red velvet cake.
And to live within
the warmth of your heart
Hi.
Hi.
I hope you didn't
come all the way
into the city
for hot chocolate.
Actually, I moved
back here six months ago.
I'm over in Rogers Park.
Really? That...
That's great.
I'm actually back
at the Art Institute.
What?
Are you kidding me?
Mmm-mmm.
That's amazing.
Yeah. I mean, I'm sitting
in on a few classes,
and it's crazy
what my hands remember
that my, you know,
that my mind forgot.
Yeah.
So, thank you.
I didn't do anything.
You did everything.
You accepted me for who I am,
and not for
what you wanted me to be.
I just wanted you to be happy.
That's all.
Isn't there some
Cuban place around here
where we used to go
when this place was closed?
Yeah. It's... Wait.
You remember?
No, no.
I wish.
No, the memory stuff
hasn't come back, but I've...
Sonia and I have been
hanging out a little bit,
and I've been
asking her about us.
Really?
And what has she been saying?
That she doesn't think you're
seeing anyone right now.
She just happens to be right.
You? Are you seeing anyone?
That's good.
So, do you wanna go
to the Cuban place?
With me?
Okay.
Okay.
What would you say
to trying someplace
that we haven't been to before?
Someplace new?
I'd like that.
After you.
I've been looking so long
at these pictures of you
That I almost believe
that they're real
I've been living so long
with my pictures of you
Remembering you
standing quiet in the rain
As I ran to your heart
to be near
And we kissed
as the sky fell in
How I always held close
in your fear
Remembering you
running soft through the night
You were bigger and brighter
and wider than snow
And screamed
at the make-believe
And you finally found
all your courage
Remembering you
fallen into my arms
Crying for the death
of your heart
You were stone white
So delicate
You were always
so lost in the dark
Remembering you
how you used to be
Hold for the last time
then slip away quietly
Open my eyes
But I never see anything
If only I'd thought
of the right words
I could have held on
to your heart
If only I'd thought
of the right words
Looking so long
at these pictures of you
But I never hold on
to your heart
There was nothing
in the world
Than to feel you
deep in my heart
There was nothing
in the world
Than to never feel
the breaking apart
