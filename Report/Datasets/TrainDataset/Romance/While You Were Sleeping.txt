LUCY: Okay, there are two things that
I remember about my childhood.
I just don't remember it
being this orange.
First, I remember being with my dad.
He would get these far-off looks
in his eye,
and he would say,
"Life doesn't always turn out
the way you plan."
I just wish I'd realized at the time
he was talking about my life.
But that never stopped us
from taking our adventures together.
He would pack up
our sometimes-working car,
and he would tell me amazing stories
about strange and exotic lands
as we headed off to
exciting destinations like Milwaukee.
It's amazing how exotic Wisconsin isn't.
But my favorite memories
were the stories
that he would tell me about my mom.
He would take me to the church
where they got married,
and I'd beg him to tell me more
about the ceremony
and about my crazy Uncle Irwin,
who fell asleep
in the macaroni and cheese.
And I asked my dad when he
knew that he truly loved my mom.
And he said to me, "Lucy,
your mother gave me a special gift.
"She gave me the world."
Actually it was a globe with a light in it.
But for the romantic that he was,
it might as well have been the world.
Well, the first time I saw him,
he didn't exactly give me the world.
It was a dollar-fifty train token.
But I looked forward to it
every single day.
He started coming to my booth
between 8:01 and 8:15 every morning,
Monday through Friday,
and he was just perfect.
My Prince Charming.
Well, we've never actually spoken,
but I know someday we will.
I know it. I just know it.
And I know that someday
I will find a way to introduce myself,
and that's gonna be perfect.
Just like my prince.
$45 for a Christmas tree
and they don't deliver?
You order $10 worth of chow chow mein
from Mr. Wong's,
they bring it to your door.
I should've gotten the blue spruce.
They're lighter.
Ahh!
FUSCO: Lucy!
Nature of claim,
Christmas tree through window.
How am I gonna put that on my insurance?
They're still pissed
about the fire we had
when Joe Jr. Barbecued in the stairwell.
- I missed that one.
- Oh, great sausage.
- Look, I'll pay for this.
- That's okay, Lucy.
My brother Julie's
in the glass business.
Oh, I almost forgot. Merry Christmas.
Aw, Lucy.
You didn't have to do that.
Well, I wanted to.
I haven't even gotten
to my shopping yet.
JOE JR: Hey, Pop.
Can I give that bottle of Blue Nun
from cousin Ornella
to my probation officer?
FUSCO: Can't you see
we got some company?
- Say hello.
- Hello, Luce.
Nice, uh...
Sweater.
- Thank you.
- It's over there.
Lucy, you're a nice girl.
Joe Jr.'s still single.
Yeah, it's a shocker.
What'll you have?
- Oh, the usual.
- What's that?
- Mustard, Coke.
- Lucy. Lucy, Lucy, Lucy.
- Hi, Jerry.
- I'm glad to find you here.
I was hoping you'd find me in Bermuda.
Bermuda? Oh, that's good.
I am recommending you
for Employee of the Month.
The usual.
Really? I didn't know there was
an Employee of the Month.
Oh, yeah.
"Supervisor Jerry Wallace
nominates Lucy Moderatz
"for Employee of the Month.
"Lucy is never tardy,
always works holidays,
"even if she has worked
the previous holiday.
"Just because she worked Thanksgiving,
"Lucy is willing to work Christmas, too."
Jerry, I'm not working Christmas.
Uh...
You'll get a nice plaque
with the mayor's stamp on it.
- I didn't vote.
- You get to ride on a float.
- Saint Paddy's Day.
- I hate parades.
Did I mention extra holiday pay?
- I hate you.
- Lucy.
Look, Violet is sick
and Celeste can't switch
because she's got some big family thing.
And I promised my kids
I'd be there for them this year.
It stinks, Jerry.
I know it isn't fair,
and I can't make you do it.
But, Lucy, you're the only one...
Without family.
Come on, Richie.
MAN 1: Hi.
Merry Christmas.
Uh-huh.
Nice coat?
Merry Christmas to you, too?
You're beautiful. Will you marry me?
I love you.
MAN 2: Hey.
MAN 3: Nice coat.
MAN 1: It's Christmas.
I don't want any trouble. Whoa!
MAN 2: Let's go, let's go, let's go.
Somebody help me, please.
Sir? Sir? Sir?
Are you okay? Can you get up?
God, sir, this is not good.
Oh, God, mister...
Can you... Are you breathing?
Oh, God, you smell good.
Please wake up. Please, please.
Oh, God. Can you wake up?
- Can you hear me?
-
Oh, God.
Wake up. Somebody help me, please.
Mister? Mister?
There's a train coming, and it's fast.
It's an express.
Oh, God.
Hi.
MAN: All right, bring him down here.
WOMAN 1: I need a doctor here.
WOMAN 2 ON PA:
Dr. Stevens, Dr. Jessica Stevens...
Hi, excuse me.
About two seconds ago,
a man was brought in...
- What's his name?
- I don't know it.
- I need to know his name.
LUCY: - He's right there.
You don't know his name?
Why don't you...
- You can't go in.
- You can't go in there.
- You don't understand.
- INTERN: You family?
- Family only.
LUCY: - No, you don't understand.
- I was...
- You wait there.
Okay, guys, what do we got here?
I was gonna marry him.
INTERN: Get Dr. Rubin
or Dr. Ortiz here.
WOMAN 2 ON PA:
Dr. Memrack to ICU West.
WANDA: Come on, come with me.
Over here.
- Let him hear your voice, hon.
- Okay.
Hi.
Everything is gonna be okay. I know it.
It's gonna be fine.
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?
Is that the woman that saved his life?
- Yeah.
- Whoa.
It gets even better than that.
She's his fiancée.
Excuse me, ma'am.
I'm sorry, but I need to ask you
a few questions.
- Okay.
- Officer, may I interrupt you?
- Sure. I'll be right over there.
- Thank you.
- I'm Dr. Rubin.
- Hi, I'm Lucy.
Don't tell me about passes.
Where the hell is he?
MARY: - Dad, don't embarrass me.
- Oh, he's so pale. Oh, my God.
- RUBIN: What is this?
- This is my son. How is he?
RUBIN: You can't come
bursting into this unit.
MIDGE: - He'll be all right, right? Right?
- What happened? What's going on?
- He's in a coma.
- On Christmas Day.
OX: Jesus.
His vital signs are strong,
his brain waves are good.
-  Brain waves?
- RUBIN: He's going to get through this.
- Are you a specialist?
- How did this happen?
He was pushed from the platform
at the train station.
Who's she?
- She's his fiancée.
- His fiancée?
WANDA: Yeah.
MARY: Peter's fiancée?
- Peter's engaged?
- Yeah, I thought...
No, no, you don't understand.
MIDGE: I mean,
he would have told us, right?
Maybe he was busy.
Too busy to tell his own mother
he's getting married?
MIDGE: Don't yell at him.
OX: I'm not yelling at him.
- If only Jack were here.
- Grandma?
- Is she okay?
- She's got a little heart problem.
She's had three attacks already.
They weren't attacks.
They were episodes.
OX: Oh, jeez.
- Nothing wrong with her hearing.
- Excuse me, Doctor.
What is she doing in here?
Hey, buddy, she saved his life.
You saved his life?
Yeah, yeah, but...
I thought he was pushed
off a train platform.
She jumped on the tracks.
You jumped on the tracks?
Doctor, it's supposed to be family only.
- She is family.
- She's the fiancée, you idiot.
- Look, I'm sorry, you don't understand.
MIDGE: - I'm awfully sorry.
We haven't seen him for a long time,
so we didn't know.
I always wanted him to find a nice girl.
I'm so glad he found you.
Oh, Peter.
- Why did you say that?
- Say what?
- I'm not his fiancée.
- Why did you tell me that you were?
I'm not engaged.
I've never even spoken to the guy.
What? But downstairs you said...
You said you were gonna marry him.
Oh, jeez, I was talking to myself.
Well, next time you talk to yourself,
tell yourself you're single
and end the conversation.
- What am I gonna do?
- I don't know.
She held me so tight.
You know, I couldn't tell her.
- I know.
- Excuse me, nurse.
- Is there a pharmacy in the hospital?
- What do you need?
Elsie, she wants nitroglycerin.
Oh, for her heart problem?
Problem?
Problems.
You know something,
I think you saved her life.
In fact, I think you saved
the whole family.
Bless you.
WANDA: Why don't you come with me?
I'll take you down there.
So,
tell us how you met Peter.
Ma, she doesn't wanna
talk about that now, okay?
ELSIE: Why not?
Could use a nice story.
- How do you know it was nice?
- ELSIE: Of course it was nice.
Why shouldn't it be nice?
What about that other girl?
The one he met in the bar.
What's that got to do
with the price of eggs?
- Ashley Bartlett Bacon.
MIDGE: - Ox.
All I know is
she was pretty high and mighty
for someone named after breakfast meat.
Well, he has a nice girl now.
So did you steal him from Ashley?
I bet it was love at first sight. Right?
I have a sense about these things.
- Elsie, let her tell it.
- She is telling it.
I bet that he picked you up
in that fancy car of his...
What was it about him that,
you know, first struck you?
- It was his, uh, smile.
- They're caps.
- Six hundred bucks a tooth.
- Shh!
Well, um, we saw each other
and, um, he smiled.
And...
And I knew that my life
would never be the same.
So...
- Tomorrow night, 8:00.
- What?
I got Ice Capades. I know a guy.
LUCY: Hi.
Um...
Bet you're wondering what I'm doing
here in the middle of the night, huh?
Well, I thought
I should introduce myself.
My name's Lucy.
Lucy Eleanor Moderatz.
Um...
Think you should know
your family thinks we're engaged.
Never been engaged before.
This is all very sudden for me.
What I really came here to tell you
was that
I didn't mean for this to happen.
I don't know what to do.
I mean, if you were awake,
I wouldn't be in this mess.
Oh, God. Not that I'm blaming you.
Sorry.
It's just that, you know,
when I was a kid,
I always imagined what I would be like,
or where I would be,
or what I would have when I got older.
And, you know, it was the normal stuff.
You know, I'd have a house and family
and things like that.
You know, not that I'm complaining
or anything,
because, you know, I have a cat.
I have an apartment. Um...
Sole possession of the remote control.
That's very important.
It's just...
I never met anybody
that I could laugh with, you know?
Do you believe in love at first sight?
No, I bet you don't.
You're probably too sensible for that.
Or have you ever, like, seen somebody,
and you knew that if only that person
really knew you, they would...
Well, they would of course dump
the perfect model that they were with
and realize that you were the one
that they wanted to just grow old with.
Have you ever fallen in love with
somebody you haven't even talked to?
Have you ever been so alone you spend
the night confusing a man in a coma?
-
- MAN ON PA: Brian Lynch.
Mr. Brian Lynch,
please call Amber Lynch at 2617.
Oh, my God.
Bye.
- Lucy. We didn't know you were here.
- Hi.
LUCY: - Hi.
- Hi.
- Were you here all night?
- Yeah.
You're like me.
I could always sleep anywhere.
And believe me, she has.
Way to go, Gram.
So how's Peter?
LUCY: Well, he's got more color.
He has some color.
Looks like he has some color.
Yeah.
Well, I have to go,
so it was great to see you guys again.
- Why don't you tell her? Go on, tell her.
- Yeah.
We didn't get to celebrate Christmas,
so it would be nice if you could join us.
Oh, um...
I would love to, but I can't.
- Jack's gonna be there.
- That's right. You haven't met Jack yet.
- No, not yet.
- He'll be so happy to meet you.
So you'll come tonight?
I really shouldn't,
because I have to work. I can't.
OX: Look, here. Put your phone number
and address there.
Midge'll call you and talk you into it.
LUCY: Okay.
Here's another card
for when you change your mind.
We're in the estate-furniture business.
We buy furniture from dead people.
Okay. All right, well, I have it, so bye.
MIDGE: - Bye, dear. See you later.
- Bye.
- Ma'am? Excuse me, ma'am.
- What? What is this?
I'm sorry, Mrs. Callaghan.
These are your husband's things.
He's not my husband.
I'm sorry. Your fiancé.
MAN: You're Peter's fiancée?
- Okay.
- Dalton Clarke.
Colleague of Peter's
at Lubel, Parker, Jacobs and Fink.
- I have to go now.
- He's a great guy.
He's had a tough year.
What with the accident
last month and all.
- Accident?
- Well, of course it was an accident.
I mean, it wasn't my...
Did he tell you it was my fault?
We're playing basketball, all right?
I carry a pencil. I'm a lawyer, I do that.
LUCY: - Okay.
- Jesus, what's he...
It's gonna be okay.
JERRY: So, what's the big deal?
LUCY: What's the big deal? Jerry, they
think I'm their future daughter-in-law.
And the grandmother,
she's got this heart thing.
If I tell the truth, she's gonna have
a heart attack and die,
and it's gonna be on my head.
Well, then, go along with it.
And when Peter comes out of the coma,
the family will be so happy,
they won't care that you lied to them.
They'll probably even thank you for it.
Just mustard.
Okay, what if he doesn't
come out of his coma?
Well, then who's to know?
- I don't know.
- Now, look, look. Lucy.
When my mother found out
I was getting married to my wife,
her intestines exploded.
- Oh, my God.
- Now, you tell them now,
you might as well shoot Grandma.
Come on, Mel. Mel...
Psst, psst, psst!
What am I doing?
SAUL: Lucy.
LUCY: - Hi, Saul. Hi.
- You made it?
- Yeah.
- How do you feel?
Okay. Okay.
Come on, keep me company for a while.
I don't like to smoke in the house.
- Listen, you want one?
- I'm trying to quit.
SAUL:  That's good.
Here, sit down.
They don't bother you, do they?
No, no, I'm fine.
Did you know
that I was Peter's godfather?
Really? I thought you had to be
Catholic for that.
Ox fudged it over.
He donated 50 folding chairs
to Father Shea's bingo night.
You know, being a godfather
is very important to Catholics.
It means you're practically
part of the family.
Well, you're lucky.
It's really important to have family
around this time of year.
Are you, uh...
I mean, are your parents with you?
No, no.
My mom died when I was really young.
And a couple years ago, my dad got sick.
And we moved from Indiana to Chicago
so he could go to a research hospital.
Research.
A medical term for "very expensive"?
Yeah. Yeah, exactly. I had to quit school
and then I started working for the CTA.
And about a year ago,
he decided he had had enough research,
and he passed away.
My wife of 51 years passed away
two years ago, February the 9th.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, it was a rough time for me.
- Yeah.
- But Ox got me through.
- You're good friends?
- The best.
Lucy, the Callaghans...
Well, they took me in
as part of their family.
I'd never let anyone hurt them.
Neither would I.
I believe you wouldn't.
Lucy? You came?
Hi, Saul. Oh, this is great.
Okay, come on in, you two.
It's freezing out here.
Elsie made her eggnog.
- Word to the wise, drink soda.
- Okay.
MIDGE: Ox, Mom, look who's here.
Lucy came.
What a surprise.
LUCY: - Hi, Mary.
- Come on in. It's cold out there.
Oh, sweetheart.
ELSIE: We've got
the most wonderful dinner.
LUCY: It smells so good.
Hi.
This is so beautiful.
MARY: That's Peter on the right.
LUCY: He's so sweet.
MARY: Oh, yeah, the squirrels.
MIDGE: Eggnog, everyone.
Ma, where are you?
I'm serving your eggnog.
ELSIE: I'm getting my camera.
Come on, everybody.
Get close to the tree.
MIDGE: Christmas pictures.
- Lucy, come on.
- OX: Come on, Lucy.
MIDGE: - Let's go.
- I...
ELSIE: Watch the birdie.
MIDGE: Oh, Ma, take it again. I blinked.
- SAUL: You're lucky. I'm blind.
-
OX: Oh, yeah, I love it.
- Oh, excuse me.
- I don't drink anymore.
Oh.
- I don't drink any less either.
-
ELSIE: Perhaps I should.
SAUL: You got me on that one.
OX: Oh, look at this.
MIDGE: More presents.
I'll take these two.
MARY: What is this?
OX: Open it.
SAUL: What is that?
MIDGE: Turn them over.
- Pierced? Really?
MIDGE: - Mmm-hmm.
MARY: Oh, my God, thank you.
- We'll go to Wal-Mart on Monday.
- Thank you.
Don't thank me. If it was up to me,
I would've gotten you a Barbie.
MIDGE: Did you like that?
OX: More presents.
- We hit the jackpot.
MARY: - Mom, this is for you.
Oh! "To Ox, from Uncle Al."
Who the hell is Uncle Al?
Uncle Al.
You know, Uncle Al from Buffalo.
SAUL: You remember Al.
OX: Uncle Al?
To Lucy, from Santa.
MIDGE: You remember Uncle Al.
SAUL: Remember Al? He was here.
OX: Oh, yeah, that Uncle Al.
MIDGE: That was
a real good Christmas.
Seven bow ties, I bet.
- Oh, you shouldn't have.
- ELSIE: That's right, she made these.
Oh, the gold watch. I love it.
Oh, sweetheart, it's so expensive.
MARY: Oh, Gram, these are so great.
Thank you.
They're so pretty.
MIDGE: You remember Uncle Al,
don't you?
ELSIE: No. Yeah, yeah.
Well, he wasn't really uncle.
OX: I never got him anything.
MIDGE: He had this moustache.
He was Daddy's friend, right?
OX: I know an Uncle Ed.
MIDGE: No, Uncle Al.
PETER ON RECORDING:
This is Callaghan.
Leave a message
and I'll get back to you. Ciao.
ASHLEY ON PHONE: Hi, it's Ashley.
Lisbon is absolutely gorgeous,
but I'm cutting my trip short,
because I have been doing
a lot of thinking,
and what the hey,
I will marry you.
MARY: Jack.
JACK: Hey.
MARY: Hey, buddy.
Shh!
Don't wake Lucy.
Who's Lucy?
Lucy's Peter fiancée.
No, that's not Peter's fiancée.
MARY: You haven't met her?
JACK: No.
Well, she's great.
You're gonna love her.
JACK: You know what, kid?
Maybe I'll stay the night.
MARY: Don't eat my cereal
in the morning.
JACK: So it's Mary's special cereal.
MARY: Last time you took
the toy surprise, remember?
- Good morning.
- Ah!
Oh, God.
- Oh, you scared me.
- Sorry.
Good morning, Jack.
Um...
I guess I don't remember meeting you.
Well, it's probably because
we've never met.
That might have something to do with it.
Cab. I have to go.
I'm really late, because I have to go.
But it was nice to meet you, Jack.
So bye.
- Lucy.
- Okay, look.
- I know that I...
- Hey.
Hmm?
Welcome to the family.
Oh, thank you.
Bye.
We pray that the Lord's healing presence
will be felt by those who are sick
and by their families.
Especially Jo-Jo Goreki,
Peter Callaghan,
Craig Little and Peggy Dunne.
We pray to the Lord.
- Lord, hear our prayer.
- ALL: Lord, hear our prayer.
O, God, you call us to live as one family.
- Save us from...
- So who's this Lucy?
She's your brother's fiancée.
You'd think
if Peter were getting married,
he would have announced it
in the Tribune.
- We read the Sun Times. Amen.
- ALL: Amen.
So why did she sneak out this morning?
She has a job.
I like Mass better in Latin.
It's nicer when you don't know
what they're saying.
- Did you get the Bourbeau estate?
- Got it.
- What about Downey's?
- Got it.
- Himmelstein's?
- Yeah.
- Did you get Van Allan?
- Himmelstein's took too long.
- For Chrissake, Jack.
- Stop swearing.
Look, you're running the business now.
There's something I'd like to talk about.
- Talk about that later, okay?
- Talk about it now.
- He can't kill you in church.
- Will you please pipe down?
Hey, be nice, pally. We're in church.
- You're disrupting the Mass.
- Who made you the pope?
Ox.
How did Joe Kelly get to be a lector?
He takes marijuana.
ALL: Amen.
Ugh.
GIRL 1: Hi, Luce.
GIRL 2: Hi, Lucy.
WOMAN: Hi, Lucy.
JOE JR: Come on, you stupid wing nut.
Your mother's...
Excuse me, do you live here?
Live here? I own this place.
Great. Well, then you would know
the woman that lives in 201.
Know her? I'm dating her.
Very clean.
Kitty?
Kitty? Rich kitty?
Come here. Mealtime.
Kitty, kitty, kitty. Kitty, kitty, kitty.
Kitty.
Kitty?
Food. Kitty, kitty, kitty. Come here.
Come here. Come on, honey.
Where are you?
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Nice shot.
I'll get you some ice. I'm sorry.
I wasn't expecting anybody.
- Hey, how'd you get in here?
- Um...
Key?
Key. Oh, you stay here a lot, huh?
Oh, you know, feed the cat.
Peter doesn't have a cat.
Oh.
Hello. Hello, honey.
Fluffy. Hello, Fluffy.
You must be so hungry.
Are you gonna get that?
Oh, no, I'm gonna let the machine get it.
Hello?
It's for you.
Hello.
Okay. Bye-bye.
That was the hospital.
They say it's customary for friends and
family to come down and give blood.
Let's go together.
You know what? I think maybe
we should take your truck.
- Oh, no, we ought to take Peter's car.
LUCY: - Huh.
Okay.
You know where it's parked, don't you?
Oh, yeah, I... Yeah.
- Hmm.
- Hmm.
Hey, we'll have to get your picture
for the mantel.
- Of me?
- No, of you and Peter.
I'm not that photogenic.
I doubt that.
All right, now, I want you to sit here
and sip this or you'll get woozy.
When did you start seeing Peter?
September 17th.
- Three months. That's quick.
- You have no idea.
- That's fast. That's...
- NURSE: Miss.
I'm fine.
JACK: That's a fast engagement.
NURSE: Wait, I'm not finished.
I got it. I got it. I got it.
Oh.
What the hell's he got a TV for?
He's in a coma for Chrissakes.
Ox. You know, he might hear you.
Then get him a radio.
Maybe he'd like us to sing to him.
Maybe Lucy knows his favorite song.
- Puff the Magic Dragon.
- Dragon.
Dragon.
Which one of the Three Stooges
was Peter's favorite?
- Curly.
- Curly. Ha!
- He's everybody's favorite.
- Well, I like Shemp.
- Favorite ice cream?
- Baskin-Robbins.
- Favorite baseball team?
- Chicago.
Cubs or White Sox?
What the heck is going on?
Why are you asking her
all these questions?
Don't ask me. Ask her boyfriend.
That isn't very funny, you know.
No, no. Not this boyfriend. Joe Fusco.
Joe Jr?
Mmm-hmm. That's right.
Mr. Joe Fusco, Jr.
He said that you were intimate.
Yeah, well, he also said
he invented aluminum foil.
He's delusional.
He was very lucid when I talked to him.
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.
- Ma, are you okay?
- You see what you did?
What did I do?
You know, if she wanted to prove it,
she'd prove it.
Peter has one testicle.
- No way.
- Way.
About a month ago,
there was an accident,
and he was playing basketball,
and his friend had a pencil
in his back pocket.
Ew.
Maybe, um...
No.
SAUL: Oh, no.
JACK: Well, somebody's gotta look.
MARY: Don't look at me.
- No.
- Yeah, maybe, uh...
- OX: Listen, it's not my...
- Okay, I'm his mother.
Oh, Ma, ew.
Well, look at the bright side.
He's got more room in his Jockey shorts.
Ma.
- Who is it?
- JOE JR: What gives?
- You stood me up.
- For what?
- Our date.
- What date?
To the Ice Capades.
I had to eat your ticket.
I never said
I would go on a date with you.
- Yes, you did.
- No, I didn't.
- Did.
- Didn't.
- Who is it?
- SAUL: Lucy, it's Saul.
- Oh, my God.
- What, are you two-timing Joe Jr?
LUCY: I'm not two-timing.
I never one-timed.
- Hey, I'll fight the guy.
- Hey. Get in the closet.
- Not a word.
- JOE JR: Nice panties.
Hey.
I like boxer shorts, but I'll try these if...
- Sorry.
- Have you got company?
No, TV. It's on next door.
Do you want some coffee or tea
or something?
No, no. Not a thing.
Lucy, there's something you should know.
What?
Well, the night you visited Peter,
I was outside the door.
I know the truth.
Sorry. You know,
you don't have to worry,
because I'm gonna tell them everything.
Don't tell them a thing.
You remember the day you said
you'd never do anything
to hurt the family?
- Yeah.
- Well, since they met you,
they figure they have Peter back.
Now, if you tell them the truth,
you'll take him away again.
They need you, Lucy.
Just like you need them.
Now, look, I know you're a good girl.
And I know you'll do the right thing.
- I don't know.
- Yeah. Yes, you will.
Oh, by the way,
how did you know about the...
Peter, with the one, uh...
You know something?
I don't wanna know.
LUCY: Bye.
JOE JR: Ooh!
Oh, my God. What are you... What?
- What are you doing?
- I slipped.
- You're trying on my shoes?
- No.
When I fell, my foot went
- right into the shoe.
-
- Who is it?
- JACK: It's me, Jack Callaghan.
Oh, my God, doesn't anybody
use a phone anymore?
- I do.
- I'm not talking about 900 numbers.
Who told?
Hi. So, more questions?
No. I have an engagement present
for you.
You really shouldn't have.
- I didn't. It's from my parents.
- Oh!
It's furniture.
You want me to bring it up?
Hey, was that Saul I saw leaving?
What's that?
Cat.
Big cat?
I think you should bring it to...
Bring it to Peter's apartment.
- You don't know what it is.
- Well, you know,
anything would look nicer
in Peter's apartment.
You know what? I'll come with you.
-
-
You know what?
I think you parked too...
You know, I think you parked
too close to the other car.
I had to. We gotta unload the furniture.
Ready for your surprise?
Ta-da!
Oh, that is great. That is so great.
- You like that?
- Yeah.
Too bad. Ox bought you the love seat.
LUCY: - Oh, I'm sorry.
- Don't be. I made this.
- This? No, you didn't.
- Shocking, isn't it?
- Can I sit in it?
- Rock out.
My God, this is perfect.
You should go into business
or something.
Well, that gets tricky.
Oh, yeah, working with your dad
and everything, right?
The business used to be called
Callaghan and Sons,
and when Peter went off to law school,
it became Callaghan and Son.
If I were to leave, it'll just be Callaghan.
Let's take a second here
and unlock the doors...
No, I got it, I got it. See? Here we go.
Oh, this technique. It's always very...
A very modern technique.
DOORMAN: Excuse me, sir.
What apartment?
Well, sir, I'm sorry, but guests
have to be announced, you know?
Well, I'm with her. I'm helping her.
- So?
- You don't know her?
DOORMAN: No.
But I'm new here.
Oh, well, she's Peter Callaghan's
fiancée in 57G.
Oh. Oh, yeah.
They told me about her, sir.
She's scary.
Tell me about it.
Be careful.
Maybe we should angle it a little bit.
I think it's wedged.
Why don't you step back for a little bit?
I'm gonna try an old trick.
What's the trick?
Push it really hard.
Okay.
Okay, okay, push.
JACK: I did.
Do you want me to help you now?
- All right, a little help would be good.
- Okay.
Ready? One, two, three.
Ooh!
I think the sofa should go right there.
Oh, no. No, no, no. Look at this.
Idiot has blocked me in.
- But I told you not to park that close.
- Aargh.
Hey, check the meter, see what time.
It's 6:00. They can pretty much stay
here all night if they wanted to.
- All night, huh?
- Um...
Good night.
You're just gonna leave me here
with the truck?
Basically, yeah.
Well, maybe I ought to walk you back.
Well, what for?
- For protection.
- Oh, no, I'm fine. I'm okay.
For me. I don't wanna be here
by myself. This is Chicago.
JACK: You look cold.
LUCY: Hmm?
JACK: You look cold.
LUCY: Probably because I am cold.
How about you?
JACK: This jacket's reversible.
I'm wearing the warm side now.
LUCY:  Oh, I see.
JACK: You need a better coat.
- This is my dad's.
- Then he's probably freezing.
He passed away.
- Sorry.
- It's not your fault.
He passed away last year.
I don't even remember my mom, so...
Well, what was he like?
He was a lot like me.
Dark hair, flat chest.
What do you remember most about him?
Oh, that. Okay. Well...
He liked maps.
Yeah, I live by maps.
My truck's filled with them.
He used to hear of a place on the TV,
we would pull out the atlas,
we'd find where it was and we'd route
out this, like, little way to get there.
If there was one place
in the world where you'd go...
Florence.
Italy? I haven't delivered
any furniture to Florence yet,
- but I'm told it's nice.
- Yeah.
I take it you've never been there.
Well, you know, the L doesn't exactly
make it all the way to Florence, so...
Oh, but I do have...
My passport.
- You have your passport? With you?
- Yes, I do.
Yes, well, just in case I need to
quickly leave the country.
- You need to...
- Yeah, it's perfect. It's great.
Oh, you're right.
You're not very photogenic at all.
Just joking.
There aren't any stamps in that.
Yeah, well, I haven't gone anywhere yet.
But, you know, I'm planning
the trip to Florence really soon,
so, you know, I'll go.
That'll make your dad very proud.
Yeah.
You know, in a very small way,
you kind of remind me of him a little bit.
I see.
So he was a classy guy,
always a gentleman.
A working man, who...
Who just stepped in doggy poopy.
Oh!
Now, that's classy. That's classy.
JACK: All right, tell me more.
Where did you grow up?
LUCY: God, you've just become
Mr. Chatty this evening.
JACK: The fact is,
I'm about to start shivering,
and making conversation
keeps my face from freezing.
Thank you. I had a good time.
- It's slippery here. Come on.
- I'm fine.
We got this far,
I'll take you the rest of the way.
LUCY: You gotta watch out. A little icy.
So you gonna go see Peter tomorrow?
- All right.
- Do not take me with you.
- No, it's all right. Not too bad.
- You got it? Good? Okay.
This is big.
- There we go. All right.
- Okay.
- All right?
- Yeah.
I think we're all right now.
Yeah. Let's just move this way.
This way.
- Whoa. Ow.
- Ow.
What was that?
Oh. Was that my pants or my muscles?
Oh, give me your hand.
Give me your hand.
- Whoa.
- Okay.
Oh, man.
Do you have an extra pair of pants
in your apartment?
If you fit into my pants, I will kill myself.
- You don't have to follow me.
- No, you're blocking the wind.
I'll wait till you get inside.
Well, good night.
Night.
- I'll see you when I see you?
- Yeah.
All right, Lucy, it's either me or him.
Him.
You don't have to answer right away.
I'm having an affair. I like Jack.
Who's Jack?
- Peter's brother.
- So?
- So he thinks I'm engaged.
- To who?
To Peter.
Lucy, I really don't have time for this.
Oh, no, no, no.
You have to tell me what to do.
Tell the truth.
If I tell Jack that I lied to his family,
he will never speak to me again.
And Ox and Midge and Mary and Saul.
Saul? Who's Saul?
He's the next-door neighbor.
But you know what? Actually, he knows.
Lucy, you're born into a family.
You do not join them
like you do the Marines.
You have to tell me what to do.
Pull the plug.
- You are sick.
- I'm sick?
You're cheating on a vegetable.
JACK: Down and dirty.
Are you gonna fold?
You're not gonna fold?
He is staying in with a pair.
Very impressive. Very bold, confident.
Full house.
You are unlucky at cards.
But lucky in love.
Remember in, like, fifth or sixth grade,
I was starting to get really good
at poker,
and going home with lots of lunch money?
I got to know the principal's office
really well.
He always used to say to me,
"How come you can't be more
like your brother Peter?"
Well, you know what?
I was all right with that.
I had no problems with that,
because I was proud of you.
And I was never envious
of anything that you had.
Until now.
I'll cut the deck.
High card gets Lucy.
All right, we'll go best out of three.
So, Lucy, have you and Peter decided
where you're gonna go on your honeymoon?
I went to Cuba.
Ricky Ricardo was Cuban.
Didn't Peter look great today?
SAUL: Oh, that kid.
You know, he should've been an actor.
He's tall.
All the great ones were tall.
Lucy, you think you can find me
a nice girl for Jack?
Oh, Mom, come on.
Well, I really don't know Jack's type,
so I'm not one to...
I like blonds. Chubby ones.
Alan Ladd wasn't tall.
Marshal Dillon was 6'5".
MIDGE: Well, we all know
who Lucy's type is.
These mashed potatoes are so creamy.
You like brunettes.
I could never make a good pot roast.
You need good beef.
Argentina has great beef.
Beef and Nazis.
John Wayne was tall.
Dustin Hoffman was 5'6".
Would you wanna see Dustin Hoffman
save the Alamo?
MIDGE: These mashed potatoes
are so creamy.
OX: Spain has good beef.
MIDGE: Mary mashed them.
- SAUL: Cesar Romero was tall.
- Cesar Romero was not Spanish.
I didn't say Cesar Romero was Spanish.
Well, what did you say?
I said Cesar Romero was tall.
ELSIE: We all know he's tall.
SAUL: Well, that's what I said.
Cesar Romero was tall. That's all I said.
LUCY: So if you need any help
with history, don't call me.
Now, remember, honey, if you're free
for New Year's, we wanna see you.
- Thank you very much.
- Yeah.
- I had a great time. Thank you.
- Us, too.
- Bye.
- Bye-bye, Lucy.
Hey, look, you guys.
You're under the mistletoe.
Ooh!
- Kiss her then. It's mistletoe.
- SAUL: Yeah.
- It's tradition.
- JACK: It's Christmas.
Come on, idiot, kiss her.
SAUL: There you go.
OX: Oh, yeah.
- Good night.
- Bye.
ELSIE: Good night.
MIDGE: Mary,
we're on dish detail tonight.
- Let's go.
MARY: - Ma.
MIDGE: I don't wanna hear
any excuses.
SAUL: Since the first year, I remember.
MAN: Regular fare.
One token, please.
Oh, my God, Mary,
what are you doing here?
Hi. You wanna come through?
- We can?
- Yeah, absolutely.
Come on in.
WOMAN: Transfer, please.
MARY: - Hi.
- Hi.
Hey, who's this?
- I'm Mary. This is Beth.
- Hi.
Mary's my, um...
Lucy's going to marry my brother Peter.
CELESTE: What?
Lucy, you're getting married?
LUCY: Well, it hasn't
really been announced.
So it's a little awkward
for me to say anything, and, um...
- The train is here.
- Train. Okay, I'll see you later.
Thank you for coming.
It's nice to meet you, Beth.
Girl, are you pregnant?
LUCY: Yes, I'm pregnant, Celeste.
Lucy, you're not telling me
what's going on.
You're not giving me details.
What's going on?
Celeste, you have to have sex
in order to be pregnant.
But I thought you were engaged.
Well, we're waiting.
Waiting?
ASHLEY ON RECORDING:
Peter? Hi, it's Ashley.
Is this machine working?
Look, I'm back in Chicago
and I'm kind of shocked
that you haven't called me back.
Look, I really would like to
hear from you,
and I'd like to see my cat. Call me.
New Year's Eve hasn't been the same
since Guy Lombardo died.
SAUL: I love a clarinet.
You know, nobody plays the clarinet
anymore.
Guy Lombardo didn't play the clarinet.
I didn't say Guy Lombardo
played the clarinet.
- Hey, Pop.
- SAUL: Your Benny Goodman,
he could play the licorice stick.
- We got the Van Allan estate.
- Hey, way to go.
- Attaboy.
- SAUL: That's great.
OX: That's great. Attaboy.
MIDGE: Way to go.
Hey, everybody.
Lucy's pregnant.
How did you find out?
What do you mean she's pregnant?
- How do you know?
- That's what Beth said.
Jack, do you know anything about this?
OX: Go up to your room.
- Who is it?
- Joe Jr.
I'm not here.
I know that trick.
Hey, my old man's got a set of keys.
That is illegal and you know it, Joey.
Ta-da!
I told them to give me the same ones
they use in the winner's circle
at Arlington.
They're beautiful.
I can't accept them.
I could move in here.
I bet you Pop would knock 50 bucks
off the rent.
I have six months left to live.
You're just trying
to make me feel better.
It's that other guy, isn't it?
What do you mean?
I've seen the way you look at him.
What? How do I look at him?
Like you just seen your first Trans Am.
Here, take them.
You can lay them on my coffin.
Thank you.
Are you wearing the black bra?
I love black underwears.
LUCY: Jack.
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?
Um, uh...
You're going to a party.
Yeah, my friend Celeste
is having a party tonight.
Great. Hey, I'll drive you.
Oh, you know what?
It's really not that far. It's fine.
No, come on, come on.
Okay, but it's really not that far.
I move a lot of things with this truck.
LUCY: So is everything okay?
JACK: Why? Why wouldn't it be okay?
LUCY: You're just acting really weird.
JACK: No, I'm not being weird.
LUCY: Yes, you are.
JACK: No, I'm not being weird.
- So, what about Peter?
- What about Peter?
Peter is going to have a lot
to deal with when he wakes up.
- Lucy, hi. How are you?
LUCY: - Hi.
Come in, come in. Hey, everybody.
Lucy and her fiancé are here.
JERRY: Lucy. How's it going?
CELESTE: Jerry, you know Peter, right?
Thank you. Hi. Take his coat, Cindy.
- JERRY: Is this Peter?
- I gotta talk to you.
Well, jeez, he looks good.
That's not Peter, that's Jack.
- Who's Jack again?
- Peter's brother.
- Peter's the guy who's in the coma?
- Yeah.
So then why did you bring Jack?
I didn't bring Jack. He followed me here.
- So Jack's the fiancé?
- No, Peter.
Peter doesn't even know you exist.
- I know.
- So Jack is Peter?
Yeah.
- Lucy.
- Yeah?
They have doctors for this kind of thing.
JACK: Hey.
- That's spiked.
- Thank God.
- You shouldn't have any.
- Why not?
Because it's not good for the baby.
JACK: Wait a minute, will you?
MAN 1: It's freezing.
MAN 2: Watch out, watch out.
This whole evening did not work out
well at all, and...
Oh, and I'm supposed to share
some responsibility in that?
No. Would you slow down a little bit?
Look, it was just a misunderstanding,
and on top of the Joe Jr. Thing...
Excuse me?
It's nothing.
No, no, no, there's no nothing now.
What Joe Jr. Thing?
The leaning thing.
The leaning thing?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
What do you mean by the leaning...
Because he gave me flowers?
And then you leaned.
- And then I leaned.
- Yeah.
Okay. How did I lean when I leaned?
- How were you leaning?
- Yeah.
It was a lot different than hugging.
Hugging's very different.
Hugging, that involves arms and hands,
and leaning is whole bodies
moving in like this.
Leaning involves wanting
and accepting, leaning.
Hey, Luce.
Is this guy bothering you?
No, no.
Are you sure?
Because it looks like he's leaning.
Thank you. See?
JOE JR: I'll be right over here
if you need me.
Okay, thank you very much.
I know karate.
Okay, is... Ahem!
Now, all right,
what about the other thing?
The other thing?
The other misunderstanding?
Why did you think I was pregnant?
Well, Mary said that she had heard
something like that.
And you believed her?
I didn't have any reason
not to believe her.
So the only reason your brother
would wanna marry someone like me
is if I was pregnant, right?
No, no.
Good night.
The fact is,
you're not really Peter's type.
Yeah, Jack? All right. Whose type am I?
- Thank you.
- Look, it's a great idea, you and Peter.
It's just not obvious
to the whole world, that's all.
You know what, Jack?
I've had a really lousy Christmas.
You've just managed
to kill my New Year's.
If you come back on Easter,
you can burn down my apartment.
- JACK: Hey, come on, Lucy.
- What do you want from me, Jack?
I want you not to be unhappy.
And what are you,
the happiness guru, Jack?
Are you happy?
I don't remember you having
had a conversation with your father.
You wanna leave the business, don't you?
Is this just another miscommunication
that we are having here?
What do you know about my family?
Spending a week with them
does not make you an expert.
Spending a lifetime with them
hasn't made you one either.
Yeah, well, I know that keeping
your family happy gets complicated.
Would your father be happy knowing
you're sitting in a token booth
planning vacations
that you aren't taking?
No, he wouldn't. You're right.
But you have no idea
what it's like to be alone.
Hey, you have Peter.
I don't have anybody.
MAN 3: Happy New Year!
MAN 4: Happy New Year!
Good night.
MAN 5: Happy New Year!
Happy New Year!
Ox, they called me
and told me to get down here.
- What happened?
- He's awake.
Oh!
WOMAN ON PA: Will the Meyers family
please meet in the solarium?
- Boy, will he be glad to see you.
- Yeah.
RUBIN: Peter.
Peter.
Your family's here, Peter.
Who are you?
My God.
He's got amnesia.
Lacunar amnesia is a condition
in which memory loss
is localized and patchy.
Limited to isolated events.
- Selective amnesia?
- RUBIN: Okay, exactly.
Um, I'm sorry. I need to tell you
something that is really important.
- I was never...
- Pregnant?
Huh?
We know. Jack called us.
MIDGE: - Jack.
- Hey, so he's come out of it, huh?
I'm so glad you're here, honey.
Excuse me, Doctor? He's up again.
All right, let's go.
ELSIE: Jack.
Oh, I'm so glad you're here.
- Saul.
- Now, now, listen. Let me handle it.
I'm too old a friend and too old a person
for them to kill.
- I'll take care of it.
- Okay.
- And I'll do it right now. Come on.
- Okay.
SAUL: I'm right behind you.
- How you feeling, champ?
- I don't know.
Hi.
Hey, remember her?
- Should I?
- Look closely.
PETER: She looks a little familiar.
- Why?
- I think it's coming back.
- I think so.
- What's coming back? Tell me.
- Tell me. What?
- Peter, you have amnesia.
I do?
Peter, you're engaged.
- To who?
- To Lucy.
Lucy. Who's Lucy?
You don't remember, do you?
Excuse me.
Got some Jell-O for you today.
- Do I like Jell-O?
- Yum!
I think he's had enough excitement
for one evening.
- Let's all go home.
- Hang in there, champ.
MIDGE: - Good night, honey.
- Good night, Mom.
- It's so good to see you.
- Mom.
MIDGE: He looks so good, you know?
OX: He's going to be fine.
MIDGE: - I think he looked wonderful.
- All right, we'll be back.
Jack, you, too. Come on.
Let's go home.
Saul, where have you been?
What? I'm not allowed
to go to the bathroom?
- Saul.
- I'm handling it.
- I will tell them.
- When? When?
On my golden anniversary?
- Lucy, I'll tell them.
LUCY: - You better tell them.
SAUL: I said I'd tell them.
A, B, C, D, E, F, G
Jack, you've been really great
this week.
Yeah, like when I accused you
of lying to everybody.
Or when I accused you
of having a relationship with Joe Jr.
Or when I thought you were pregnant,
and I announced it to all your friends.
You've had a really busy week
this week, haven't you?
Look, Jack, I...
Starting tomorrow, things are probably
gonna be kind of different.
Yeah.
I just wanted you to know
that you've become
a really good friend.
Okay.
Good friend.
- Lucy.
- Yeah?
I didn't mean what I said
about you and Peter.
I think you two are gonna
make a really terrific couple.
And I'm really glad
that you won't be alone anymore.
- Goodbye.
- Bye.
Jack? Is that you?
Hey, Pop.
- Brought you some donuts.
- Oh, you're a savior.
Your mother's got me eating
these fat-free bran muffins.
They taste like plywood.
Catching up?
It's been almost a week
since I read the obituaries.
You know, we missed a lot of good stuff
the day after Christmas.
Been a hell of a week, hasn't it?
Life is a pain in the ass. I'll tell you.
You know, you work hard,
try to provide for the family,
and then for one minute,
everything's good.
Everyone's well, everyone's happy.
In that one minute, you have peace.
Pop.
This isn't that minute.
What do you mean?
Um...
You remember that rocking chair
I made for Grandma?
Are you kidding me?
It's so fancy, she won't even sit in it.
This fancy chair, two months ago,
I sold three just like it.
I've sold two dining tables.
I got orders for six more.
Well, that's a good side business.
It's not a side business.
This is good business.
Wait a second.
You don't want my business?
No, I don't.
- How long have you felt this way?
- A long time.
Well, why didn't you say
something sooner?
I could have sold the whole damn thing
to Uncle Eddy for twice its value.
I could have taken your mother
on the cruise with Kathie Lee Gifford.
You're not mad at me?
Are you nuts?
You are nuts.
You wanna make rocking chairs.
Hey, Mrs. Fletcher finally went, huh?
Her dining room alone
has got to be worth 40 grand.
Yeah. Those McMurphy boys,
they were moving in
before the deed was done.
That's their problem. They're too pushy.
- They're pushy, aren't they?
- We'll call them next week.
You call them next week.
That's right, I'll call them next week.
Yeah.
- Do I get a donut?
- I'm sorry.
Eighth-grade locker combination.
Birth date, 3-11-59.
You have to remember Lucy.
Social security number, 144-60-6894.
You love her. You just don't remember.
Three-point-seven-three grade point
average, Northwestern University.
Can I talk to Peter alone?
- Everything okay, Saul?
- Senior class president, 1981.
I just wanna talk to my godson.
MIDGE: - Let me take that for you.
- Thanks.
OX: We'll be back.
MIDGE: We'll see you later.
- You sure, Saul?
- Yeah, yeah, sure.
- OX: See you, son.
- See you, Dad.
Peter, I've known you
since you were born.
I've been to every major event
in your life from Cub Scouts to...
Well, to the day you discovered
hair on your schmeckel.
You've got a good education.
You're very popular
with all those friends of yours.
You make a nice living.
And everybody knows
you're a good-looking kid.
But, Peter, you're a putz.
Excuse me?
Now, look, I'm your godfather.
I mean, I love you.
I couldn't love you any more
if you were my own son.
But the fact of the matter is you're...
Well, you're a putz.
Is there a point to this?
Lucy.
Peter, there's something
you have to know about her.
You see, she...
Well...
Uh...
She's...
You know...
She's not only your fiancée,
she's your guardian angel.
Yeah. Peter, she saved your life.
Now, she's coming to see you today,
and I want you to do yourself a favor.
I want you to look deeply into her eyes
and listen with the heart of a man
who has just been given
a second chance at life.
And after two minutes,
if you're not madly in love with her,
why, tell her you wanna break up.
And you can go back to being a putz.
But if in the two minutes,
you see what the rest of us
only took seconds to see,
you will propose to her
for the second time,
and marry her
before she has a chance to escape.
Before she comes, take a little time
and think about
what an old putz just told you.
All right?
You know, if I was 40 years younger,
I'd marry her myself.
That is, if she'd convert.
- Hey, that's a joke.
- Oh, I know.
Lucy.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Um...
I came to bring you back your things.
Would you like a sandwich?
No, no. I'm okay, thanks.
Can I get you anything?
I wish I had my own clothes.
Well, I like your blue pinstripe.
- Double-breasted?
- Yeah.
- That's my favorite.
- Really?
Yeah.
Please sit down.
I saw a picture of you
when you saved the three squirrels.
They never call, they never write.
That was a long time ago.
Yeah, I guess we don't get to do
many heroic things as an adult.
Oh, that's for sure.
You do, though.
Oh, no. Jumping in front of that train
was unusual.
I don't think I've done anything
truly heroic my whole life.
I chased a purse snatcher once.
Well, that's something.
I pretended to pull a hamstring.
Well, most guys probably wouldn't have
chased after him in the first place.
I mean, I work at the L.
Believe me, I know.
You give up your seat
every day in the train.
Well...
That's not heroic.
It is to the person who sits in it.
And you always gave me something
to look forward to every day, so...
You know, you do remind me of someone.
It's probably you.
Excuse me. Excuse me, ma'am.
What apartment?
- You're new.
- Yes, ma'am. What apartment?
I'm going to Peter Callaghan's
apartment.
And your name, please?
Ashley Bartlett Bacon.
I am Peter's fiancée.
You're not his fiancée.
- Huh?
- Huh?
Hey, looking good.
Yeah, well, they're moving me
to the second floor.
Great. Mind if I drove?
No problem. See you by the elevators.
All right. Okay. There we go.
It's a little drafty.
Here, I brought you some contraband.
Chocolate peanut butter. Thanks.
Hey, Lucy's pretty terrific, isn't she?
- Oh, yeah.
- We're engaged, you know.
- Yeah, I heard that.
- Mmm.
Now, this, I remember.
Everything is better.
Everything looks better, feels better.
Even this chocolate peanut
butter tastes better.
Good. It's fudge mint.
Whatever. I'm reborn.
If you were a priest right now,
I'd confess everything to you.
No, no, don't confess.
I'm trying to be positive right now.
Just eat your ice cream.
I don't know what my secretary
sent Mom and Dad for Christmas.
It was a fruit basket.
Now, look, I don't wanna...
- I've never been faithful.
- I'm gonna leave.
Remember the squirrels?
Don't even say it.
First I knocked them out of their nest
with a rock.
Peter.
Then I saved them.
Eh!
Did you say any of this to Lucy?
That was in the past.
I'm making a clean start with Lucy.
She is... She is... She...
What is she? She's...
I'd say that she gets under your skin
as soon as you meet her.
She drives you so nuts,
you don't know whether to hug her
or just really arm-wrestle her.
She would go all the way to Europe
just to get a stamp in her passport.
I don't know if that amounts to insanity
or just being really, really likeable.
No, that's not it.
But she's gotta be really special.
She's gotta be.
And I can spend the rest of my life
finding out why.
I don't have to know now,
I don't have to know tomorrow.
I don't have to know in a year,
or 10 years.
I don't have to...
I don't have to have
all the answers today, or...
Maybe someday I'll have a clue,
but it doesn't mean
I can't make a lifetime commitment.
Does this make any sense?
Not really,
but that's common after a head injury.
My shoes.
- Oh, hi.
- What'd they say?
- Who?
- The Callaghans. Are they inside?
You missed them.
Well, what was their reaction
to the news?
- I didn't tell them yet.
- What do you mean, Saul?
- Now, what about Peter?
- Well, I didn't tell him either.
What? You said
you were gonna handle this.
- I'll handle it.
- This is handling it?
- This is handling it.
- Saul.
- What?
- You're fired.
Fired?
- Sorry.
- Pardon me.
Huh!
- Two, please.
- Four, please.
WOMAN ON PA:
Dr. Biloxi, Dr. Biloxi to ICU North.
Dr. Biloxi, Dr. Biloxi to ICU North.
- Thanks.
- NURSE: You're welcome.
- PETER: Ashley.
- Scumbag.
You're engaged?
May I remind you
that you proposed to me?
You said no. We broke up.
No, no. I was confused.
We stepped back.
You moved to Portugal.
Yes, well, I didn't think
you were going to run out
and marry the first bimbo
that you came across.
Lucy's not a bimbo.
Lucy? Lucy who?
I don't remember.
Liar.
I don't remember proposing.
I was in a coma, I have amnesia.
Amnesia? Oh, well, now, that's rich.
All right, fine. I want my stuff back.
Fine.
- Then I want my stuff back.
- What stuff?
Your nose.
You can't take my nose back.
I paid for it.
Well, then here. You paid for these, too.
Keep them. I'm a changed man, Ashley.
Go ahead. Go ahead and marry her,
you one-balled bastard.
Holy buckets, Peter.
Moving on to greener pastures.
Yeah.
You got it, pal.
MAN: So we should come back later?
WOMAN: Yes, the doctor...
- Lucy, they moved him.
- They moved him?
Come with me, downstairs.
Lucy.
What? Oh!
- Lucy.
- Hi, Peter.
My God, you look really good.
I feel really good. You know what?
Facing death makes a man
evaluate his life.
And I've been thinking about mine
and haven't liked what I've seen.
I've seen a man who has
courtside tickets to the Bulls,
a lucrative investment portfolio.
An apartment
on la rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré.
- Where?
- Paris.
But I've also seen a man
who has no one to trust,
no one to wanna have a son with.
You were there when I needed
someone the most.
You gave me a second chance at life.
It took a coma to wake me up.
My family loves you.
I might as well love you.
Lucy Eleanor Moderatz,
will you marry me?
NURSE: Wanda?
Wanda, are you all right?
Um...
NURSE: Honey? Wanda?
JOE JR: Your hair is looking
very big tonight.
PHYLLIS: Why, thank you.
I love your new cologne.
Yeah, it's called Paris Guy.
It's from France.
- Ooh, nice.
- How you doing?
- Hey, are you going to see Lucy?
- Yeah.
She is the best-looking chick
in this building.
Hey.
But you are the best-looking chick
on the third floor.
- Joe Jr.
- Phyllis.
No? This one?
This one?
I don't want any flowers from you,
I am not wearing black underwear,
and I definitely do not wanna
move in with you...
Jack.
Well, I don't have any flowers,
I wouldn't mind
seeing the black underwear,
but under the circumstances, I don't
think we should move in together.
- I thought you were Joe Jr.
- I get that a lot.
Do you wanna come in?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
Wow. So that's the wedding dress, huh?
- Hmm?
- The wedding dress.
It works good as a tie, too.
Yeah.
I just wanted to give you this
before all the presents
started to pile up.
I was dropping off some furniture
in Little Italy,
I look in a window, and...
Florence.
Thank you. It's really beautiful.
And I wanted to say that I think that
Peter is a very lucky guy.
Thank you.
I had to say that because
you're gonna be my sister-in-law.
Ha, ha, ha.
I guess we'll be seeing
a lot of each other then.
- I'd better get going.
- Yeah.
LUCY: Hey, Jack?
- Jack.
- Yeah?
Can you give me any reason
why I shouldn't marry your brother?
I can't.
- What's this?
- It's a wedding invitation.
Wait a minute.
This is your wedding invitation.
So?
Whom are we marrying?
Jerry, Peter Callaghan.
The coma guy? Are you insane?
Yes, Jerry, I'm insane.
Every day I go and I sit in a booth
like a veal.
I work every holiday, I go home to a cat.
And now a rich and handsome man
has asked me to marry him,
and I have said yes.
Okay, okay, that makes me
a raving, total lunatic.
The wedding is tomorrow, Lucy.
I know it's tomorrow, Jerry.
But I even wish it were yesterday.
That would mean that today
that I would be on my honeymoon,
that I would finally have a stamp
in my passport,
and that it would say Italy on it.
What happened with the other guy?
He didn't want me.
- Maybe she forgot.
- A woman doesn't forget her wedding.
Maybe she's stuck in traffic.
- This isn't... Does this look ridiculous?
- No, you look fine.
- All right. Well, you got the rings?
- Yeah, I got the rings.
What's the matter with you, Jack?
You suck.
I suck or the outfit sucks?
It's a toss-up.
MAN: What do you mean?
ELSIE: Oh, here she is.
She's a little nervous.
ELSIE: She's lovely.
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here
today to join...
I object.
Oh, gee.
I didn't get to that part yet.
I would have to object, too.
What about you?
- I'm thinking.
- What the hell is going on?
I am in love with your son.
- I know.
- Not that one.
That one.
Jack, what the hell did you do?
He didn't do anything.
He didn't do anything.
It was me. It was all me.
Elsie, how are you doing?
You doing okay?
Um...
Do you remember
that day at the hospital?
Of course you remember
that day at the hospital.
Well, there was a little mix-up.
I saw Peter get pushed onto the tracks,
and I saved his life.
But when I got to the hospital,
they wouldn't let me see him,
so someone told the doctor
that I was his fiancée.
Only, um...
It's not true.
I was never engaged to Peter.
Why didn't you say something?
Because I didn't know how to tell you.
We never even met
until that day on the tracks.
It's just when we were
in the hospital room,
everything happened so fast,
and I couldn't tell you the truth.
And then I didn't wanna
tell you the truth,
because the truth was that
I fell in love with you.
You fell in love with me?
No. No. Yes. All of you.
I went from being all alone
to being a fiancée,
a daughter, a granddaughter, a sister,
and a friend.
I might have saved your life
on the tracks, but you know what?
You really saved mine.
You allowed me
to be a part of your family.
And I haven't had that
in a really long time.
And I just didn't wanna let go of that.
So even though
it was just for a little while,
I will love them always.
I'm very sorry.
Oh, um...
And I'm very sorry about your carpet.
What about my carpet?
Peter Callaghan is engaged to me.
I object to this wedding.
Get in line.
And I object to your objection.
Who's that?
Ashley's husband.
You proposed to a married woman?
Yes, and I was in a coma
when my brother makes a play for my...
Sort of my fiancée.
MIDGE: Peter, how could you do this?
PETER: Listen, a deal is a deal.
MAN: You two are better off together.
MARY: Stop yelling.
ASHLEY: Hey.
SAUL: Hold on.
Hold on, just hold it right there.
Hey, Luce.
I just wanted to say that I'm sorry
things didn't work out with that guy.
And, you know, right now,
you should get in touch
with the child within
and explore your feminine side.
And, you know, don't start eating
cookies and cake and stuff like that,
because you'll blow up
like my Aunt Roberta, you know?
You deserve better than that.
So how are things going
with Miss Third Floor?
Pfft!
She's...
- Oh, Joey, Joey.
- She said that I...
LUCY: - What?
- Do you have any cookies?
LUCY: No. You know what?
- We can try on some of my shoes.
- JOE JR: Okay.
- Hey. Last day, huh?
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna miss you.
- I'm gonna miss you.
- Oh, we'll see each other.
- You better.
- Of course.
- All right?
- Bye.
- See you.
Lucy?
I need to ask you a question.
ELSIE: Get down on your knee.
It's more romantic.
He's proposing. Let him do it.
I am letting him do it.
Can I come in there, please?
I can't.
Not without a token.
MIDGE: He just put the token in.
Really? I didn't notice.
Marry me?
Yeah.
I love you.
I love you back.
- That's nice.
- I'm so happy.
LUCY: So I had planned to marry
Peter, but I married Jack instead.
Thank goodness my father was right.
Life doesn't always turn out
the way you plan.
But Jack, Jack gave me the perfect gift,
a stamp in my passport.
He took me to Florence
for our honeymoon.
I guess you might say
he gave me the world.
Peter once asked me when
it was that I fell in love with Jack.
And I told him,
"It was while you were sleeping."
