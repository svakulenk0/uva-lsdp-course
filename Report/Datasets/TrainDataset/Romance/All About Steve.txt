-
I'll be there in about 10 minutes.
- Excuse me.
-
- Sorry.
-
Right? The party was amazing
atJasmine's last night.
Girl, everybody was there.
-  Oh. Hold on.
- Uh, is Soloman here?
Oh, he's in the back, baby.
Yeah, you wanna
go out with us tonight?
-
Horowitz!
- Eight down?
- Oh. Uh, uh, that would be Bora-Bora.
It's a tough one. Don't punish yourself.
Please say yes. Please say yes.
-
- Oh, hey, Mary.
Hello, sir.
Um, I have an idea.
Do you have next week's crossword?
Indeed I do, but better yet...
I have many and a brilliant plan.
Instead of doing just one crossword per week,
I could go daily.
- I could do five per week-
- I'm sorry...
but we just don't
have space for that kind of content.
I know, but, sir, the crossword...
is everyone's favorite part of the newspaper.
And we could be just like the
where the puzzle gets harder as the week goes.
So on Monday,
a day that traditionally bites the big one-
This isn't the
We're a local paper.
- Our readers just wanna have fun.
- Oh.
Oh! Well, sir, if fun is what they want...
then Mary Horowitz has their fun.
Ta-da! For Saint Patty's Day.
Top o' the morning to ya.
- Leprechaun. -
Congratulations, man.
- Mary.
- Yes?
Do you ever stop working
long enough to, you know, like, go out?
- Mm-mmm.
- Uh, spend time with friends?
- Nope.
- Go on a date?
Mm-mmm. Oh. Uh, well,
I have a- a date this evening, sir.
- Oh?
- Yes. A-A blind one.
My parents set it up.
So I was obviously going to cancel.
Go on out on your date.
You know, have some fun with him, and-
Have you moved back into your apartment?
Uh, no. Still fumigating.
But I'm just waiting for
the chemicals to settle...
so I don't get the- the old brain cancer.
Though if I don't move out of my parents' home
soon, I'll be forced to get a lobotomy.
- So it's brain cancer, lobotomy, brain cancer-
- Mary.
Mary, less work, more of everything else.
Just enjoy being normal.
Martin, I need that feature
on the pumpkin shortage.
Is it ready?
Be normal.
- Normal.
-
I like your protective ensemble.
Bunker gear, if you will.
So, if these kids set you on fire,
you're good to what- 300 degrees?
If I survive this- Phew!
I'm supposed to go on a blind date tonight.
Yeah. Steve.
Steve. Yeah.
His mother probably thinks he's gay.
So, my parents are no doubt pimping me out
to test his sexuality. Thanks.
Yeah. I mean, wouldn't you?
Yeah? Though l-I could use a little-
if you know what I'm saying.
- Yeah. Been a long time.
-
Mary Horowitz.
Yes. Yes. That is-That's me.
Here's a treat, students.
Miss Mary Horowitz is the crossword
constructor for the
You know the crossword puzzles that you see
each week in the newspaper?
Well, it's her job to create them.
Isn't that fun?
people do crossword puzzles all the time...
but they don't often think of the person
who made all the words fit together.
and it helps if they can spell.
Okay. Um-
Okay. That's good.
Imagine, if you will, a world.
- A world-
- Daniel. You have a question.
You make a living doing that?
Well-
One puzzle a week
can't make you enough to live on.
Oh, uh-
Well, my parents have graciously permitted me
to bunk at their abode...
-
- You live with your parents?
But, then again, so do all of you.
So there. Now-
- You don't have a husband, do you?
- Or a boyfriend.
- Kids, come on.
-
No. Not-Not at- Not at this time.
Though I have had liaisons.
-
- Shoot.
-
- No, no, no, no, no.
Hi. I often suffer from
benign positional vertigo.
- Do you mind not driving until I can get my-
-
Okay. Okay. All right.
-
- Ow.
-
-
Mary? How'd it go?
Smashing success.
Or as they say in old Paris,
meaning "masterstroke."
- Okay, I'm gonna go upstairs and, uh,
get ready. - Good.
Oh. So you're going ahead with the date?
Yes. Of course.
Look how excited I am. Better get going...
if I'm gonna fall in love and get proposed to...
register at Barnes and "Normal"...
plastic bride and groom on top of a cake,
posing like this.
I'm gonna go.
Yeah.
Go out and have some fun.
Mm-hmm.
You ever wanna see any grandchildren...
you're gonna have to burn those damn boots.
-
- Carol, I have a date.
A blind one.
But...
if this Steven is anything better than
excessively hideous...
I think we really should try and make it work.
Because, if society wants me to be normal...
then normal we shall be, right?
Yes.
Oh, and, Carol, I really would appreciate
your support on this too.
And by "support," I don't mean that.
-
-
Knock, knock, knock.
Oh. Look at you.
Already have- repeatedly.
Mar. He's hot.
Please don't mean on the inside.
- -
-
-
- -
-
-
Hey, Mary. I'm Steve.
Carol. Carol, I bring news.
There's been a-
There's been a most unexpected turn of events.
My date is substantially
better looking than one might have predicted.
And you know what? Colin Powell once said,
"There's no secret to success."
Well...
clearly he doesn't understand the power
of spectacular skivvies.
There she is!
Oh, wow.
Nice boots.
Thank you.
You ready?
Mmm.
- So nice to meet you.
-
- Oh, yeah. It's raining outside.
- Hold this. The door.
-
- Thanks again.
-
-
I have to admit, at first I wasn't so sure
about this whole blind date thing...
but now I'm surprised
our parents didn't set it up earlier...
especially knowing my mother.
Must be some kind of conspiracy.
Oop. You good?
Oh, he's so not gay.
Oh, man, it's coming down.
- It's really coming down, huh?
-
I thought maybe we could go to, uh, Ernesto's.
They've got great tamales.
And they have this drink
called, uh, "El Gallo Negro."
- You have, like, two of those drinks,
it's like you- -
- Oh. You okay? You okay?
-
Mmm. Mmm. Mmm.
Wait, wait.
What-What about-What about your parents?
- What about my parents?
- Your mom.
Mmm. She's married,
and you're not her type. Mmm.
No, I just mean-
I just mean we're right in front of home.
Whoa. I just-
I just mean we're right in front of their house.
And I have no problem with that whatsoever.
-
- Oh, Steven. Oh, Steven.
-  - Is that Steven with
a "V" or Stephen with a "P-H"?
- It's with a "V."
-  I thought so.
- Yeah.
- Thought so. You know, There's over...
a million Stevens with a- a "V" in the country.
It's much more popular than the "P-H" way.
Twice as popular, in fact.
I think it was the Brits who prefer their P-H's.
-  Yeah. Not as much
as their fish and chips. -
Steven, we really should
commend our mothers...
- for predicting our all-encompassing
compatibility. - I got it.
I mean, we're-we're both
professionally compatible...
you in TV,
and- and me in, uh-you know, in newspapers.
I'll help you. Also noticing we're both
quite sexually compatible.
I don't know if you noticed like I noticed,
but we're both wearing blue...
- and what are the chances of that?
- Ooh.
- Okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Of course, the chances are
probably pretty good- -
Do you, uh- Do you like crosswords?
- Sure I do.
-
- Really?
- Yeah.
You know how when the perfect clue
gets stuck in your brain...
and it just explodes
into this bouquet of mixed emotions?
I'm - I'm aroused.
I'm intrigued. I'm a- I'm amused.
- I'm perplexed. I'm
- I'm just like all these things. - Uh-huh.
- Yeah? - Yeah. Can- Let's go back to the,
uh- the aroused.
- Okay. Okay. Wow. Steven.
- Whoa.
- Oh.
- It's like we're two rare Earth elements...
just brought together by the Norns.
- It's just-That's Scandinavian for the Destinies.
- Oh.
- And now I'm going to eat you like a
mountain lion. -
-
- You know what? I'm sorry.
- It's my phone.
- What are you doing?
- I didn't hear it ring. That's odd.
- Vibrate. It vibrated.
- I didn't feel it.
- Oh, probably because of all the grinding.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- I'll get over here.
- Yeah?
What? Yeah. What's up?
- All right. I'm coming.
- Oh! Already?
- Okay. Okay. I can hurry. I can hurry.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
l- I gotta go to work.
-
- Oh. Oh!
- Gosh, I'm so sorry.
- -
I gotta go to, uh, Boston.
Wow. Boston, huh?
That's a spectacular city.
Known not only for its- its tea...
but, uh, for Sam Morse,
who invented the Morse code.
- Get out of here.
-
No. You know, it's so- it'd be so much more
interesting staying here and everything.
Like, I really wish you could be there.
-
- Oh. l- l-
But you have a job to do.
Oh. He likes Twinkies.
Okay. It's been fun.
-  Okay. That's for you.
- Oh
Yeah.
Thank God.
Okay. Big crazy person.
-
-
-
-
-
-
And I need to- l-This crossword is bullshit.
Anyway, he said he was gonna change,
and I, for one, believe him, so-
This doesn't make any sense.
- Well, to me, it does.
- Oh. Yeah. Of course.
-  This is lame.
-  Have you tried six down?
-
-
I can't get any of these!
Oh, thanks.
Don't even bother. I don't know what the deal is,
but it looks like every single clue is-
"All About Steve"?
One across: Steve's eye color.
Five across: Steve's car odor.
Twenty across: Steve's lips taste like-
Mint explosion.
Mary, who's Steve?
- Oh. An extraordinary-
- No, no. That's not what's important.
What's important is what you've done
with this crossword puzzle. I mean, it's - it's -
- It's inspired.
- No.
- Romantic.
- No.
Oh, you're a tough one today. Let's see. Um-
It's unprofessional.
Un- No.
That's not the word.
Um, okay. Let me think. You are-
Mmm.
You've tarnished the paper's reputation.
Do you have any idea
how many readers you've let down?
Uh, 7,402, but-
- Mary.
- Yes?
Mary, we're gonna have to let you go.
Oh.
by doing a fishing themed crossword.
I know how you love the- the piscatology.
- I'm sorry.
-
We can, um-
Yeah, we'll just, uh-We'll-
I'll call you, and we'll just-
Okay, guys. You're set.
Tucson's affiliate's on site now.
Remote van's waiting for you at the airport.
-  Okay.
- But I get an Escalade, right?
Dan, we talked about this.
Nick Vasquez gets an Escalade.
- Nick Vasquez has six Emmys.
- Stolen from me.
- He was robbed, Dan. All six times.
-
I mean, he can't help it
if he's considerably older than Vasquez.
By "older" he means
experienced, Marlboro Man handsome.
Um, I'm pretty sure I meant old.
...little feller just needs to stiffen up.
-
- I'd, uh, be happy to, Dan.
- Look at how the blue brings out my eyes.
Yeah. What I was going for here was-
Oh, look at that smooth push-in.
In Hollywood, they call that a Mae West,
'cause Mae West had-
Keep talking, fellas. Keep talking your way
right back to the Weather Channel.
Right back to 10 degrees in Buffalo...
where you'll be spending most of your days
taking close-up shots of kids' snotsicles.
Well, give us something good, Danny.
- I mean-  we're fighter pilots, man.
- Yeah, we really are.
It's like sending an F-16
to kill your neighbor's dog.
And I need one big report, man,
to get that anchor desk.
Get out of my office.
And you, Angus,
you're responsible for these guys.
Make sure they don't embarrass me in Tucson.
They screw around, you're out.
- Yes, sir. - Remember the Escalade.
- Starling, how you doing?
- Whatever.
- Jackie, looking sweet. Paula.
- In your dreams.
- I can feel your love darts coming over this way.
-
- Mom. I'm working. What's up?
- You're the man, Hartman Hughes.
No, I haven't read it. Why?
Uh, okay. Hey.
Does anybody have a
-
- Right. Yeah, I got it.
Yes, I ate lunch. What section?
Oh, wow. This is all about me.
Wait. This is all about me.
Yes.
Oh. Ow, ow, ow.
Doesn't hurt, doesn't hurt, doesn't hurt.
But obviously the gods have seen-
Where are you?
Ooh. Hi. There you are.
Okay. Do you know what's at work here?
Clues. They're just-They're-They're everywhere.
One, I was thinking of not going on the date,
but then the good children...
of, uh, Youngstrum Academy kindly-
You know, they-they persuaded me to go.
Two, my date duly arrives.
And lo, not only is he, uh,
but he likes my red boots.
if I could be on the road with him.
Four, only days later,
I learn I no longer have a job...
which is obviously just the final clue
leading to the blindingly simple answer:
Onward, Mary Horowitz.
Onward. Go be with Steve.
What do you mean you don't have a job?
Missing the point, Father. Uh, the clues
have been deciphered. I must journey forth.
Journey forth where?
Father, you're making me crazy.
- ##
- Ah. Voilà, Papa.
If it is news, Steven is there.
Auf Wiedersehen.
This is Hartman Hughes reporting from the edge.
- Anybody seen Vasquez? Huh?
-
- Anybody seen Vasquez?
- No.
Too much of a pussy to come
to a dangerous hostage crisis.
-
Just gonna bring you around on the left.
Well, I wanna open up on the dust,
then we're gonna hit a 45 up to your right side.
All right. Steve, but I'm gonna indicate
down the street. I'm gonna come around the left.
- And right here.
- Ten seconds-you're on with Paula.
She still mad at you
for giving thoseJenny Craig gift certificates?
- And five, four- - Fact I was looking at
her ass to begin with is a compliment.
Paula, I've just arrived
at Wild Willy's Old Western Town...
beloved tourist attraction in Tucson, Arizona.
On a typical day, this street would be busy...
with families eager to enjoy
the Wild West life experience.
Tragically, today,
the man who plays Wild Willy the Outlaw...
has taken his role to heart...
and captured eight of his coworkers,
taking them hostage...
a mere 85 yards away from where I stand now.
-
- Shots have been fired, Paula!
-
-
or how many lives have perhaps been lost.
Okay. Breaking news, Paula.
We have our first confirmed kill:
a horse.
First victim of this senseless tragedy.
It's at moments like this I'd like to believe
that there's a heaven just for horses-
rolling meadows, lush grasses...
Long may you roam...
- in heaven, O noble horse.
-
And yet, the horse not quite dead, Paula.
He's apparently a trained horse, Paula.
- Trained to drop down-
-
during Wild Willy's
Old West shoot-out routine.
also sensitive to trucks backfiring on Route 20.
Well-
- in the midst of tragedy, a blessed miracle.
-
- Cut. - Damn it, Steve!
Do you think this is funny?
You guys could see the horse is alive, and
you're giving me the "bring 'em the tears" signal?
No, no. This is the "bring the tears" signal.
This is "Hey, the horse is up. It's galloping."
Yeah.
Y-You know what they make there? No?
No? They make-They make steel.
Yeah. Do you know how they make it? No?
I won't bore you with the whole story,
just the-just the best parts...
like- like how it's made from, uh,
molten pig iron, which-
which does not, as everyone might think,
have anything to do with pigs or swines or hogs.
It's -It's a raw iron made from iron and coke.
Or the booger sugar.
Oh. And Bessemer is also a town in Alabama.
Yea!
Yep. And you know what they have there?
No? No?
Hitler's typewriter.
Hitler's typewriter.
That guy was such an asshole.
-
We're gonna take five minutes here.
Establishments in desolate areas like this
are usually run by family members that are, uh-
No! No! Stop!
-
-
Crap. Crap.
-
-
##
Yes. Hi. Uh, Do you know when
the next bus to Tucson goes through here?
'Cause I kind of just-just missed mine.
I'm headed that way.
Oh. That's nice.
No.
No? Okay.
What about humans? That had to-
Would I tell you if I did?
Touché, sir. Touché.
-
-
Uh- Uh-
Roughly 9.85.
I will give this to you and just-Thank you.
Stop! Stop!
May I see your license, please?
Norman James Durwood?
Mary Magdalene Horowitz. Nice to meet you.
Good to meet you, I think.
you are going to have to cut my body up
into a million chunks...
and scatter me all over four states...
because this appendage...
will lead homicide detectives right to you.
And that would be  I think we're good.
My other rules about
crossword is this: no pencils.
Doing a crossword with a pencil is like
screaming with your lips duct-taped together.
you need to do it fearlessly
and with abandon and with a pen.
I prefer medium felt-tip blue.
It's about choosing your path, Norm,
and just committing to it.
maybe you weren't meant to take it.
Hmm.
-
- It's like this awful eye pus that starts to ooze-
-
quiet time might be real good right about now.
Oh. Okay.
Quiet
Hey, Norm.
Mary?
Thanks for not raping me.
My pleasure.
- All righty. Give my love to the kids.
-
Good luck. And if that Steve
shows you any disrespect-
Disrespect. Well, if you mean unmannerly...
tactless and vulgar,
he is a straight man, Norman.
Some things can't be helped.
But if you mean that he's someone-
See ya, Mary.
- See ya, Norm.
-
-
-
-
-

Oh. Oh

...Guadalupe Aguero, or to us, Baby Peggy...
was born with an extremely rare
birth defect: a third leg.
Shortly after the birth,
her poor immigrant parents separated.
Now with joint custody, one parent
wants the abnormal baby to keep the third leg.
- The other wants it gone.
- After months of legal wrangling...
the judge has ordered in favor of the mother.
Amputation surgery is scheduled for tomorrow...
but the father, Mr. Aguero,
isn't about to give up.
As his lawyers work to secure an injunction...
the father continues to rally support
around the rogue leg.
I'm quoting. " If God didn't want my daughter
to have a third leg...
he wouldn't have stuck one
between the other two."
So, for now, the fate
of the precious child's third leg...
is in the hands of a judge.
Hartman Hughes,
reporting from Oklahoma City...
near the leg,
and as always, from the edge.
- Cut.
- Okay. What do you think?
In the next segment,
I was thinking about saying...
"Baby Peggy is in
a three-legged race against time."
- What do you think?
- Okay.
- Wanna do some one-on-ones?
- Do it.
Okay.
Just intelligent arguments from both sides.
Intelligent arguments, guys!
I was born with a vestigial penis.
That means a penis hanging outside the body.
You know, like yours. I'm talking about
a ding-a-ling. Know what I'm saying?
And it was pretty good size. I was kind of
proud of it. I got to be in seventh grade.
I used to work it, hang it on the side
in gym class. I got all the attention.
Right? Okay. So, they cut it off, then-
What? What happened? H- I wasn't finished.
- That was unbelievable. - Yeah, that
was the, uh, highlight of my morning.
- Vasquez.
- Where?
Look at that. He brought toys.
Ooh, that's that guy from the news.
Hey. You with the baby. Hey.
Son of a bitch.
He's got a three-legged doll baby. Angus!
What?
Oh, no.
- Hi!
- Oh!
-  Hey.
- Hi. Hi.
- Hey. Oh.
-
- How are ya? Hey!
- I'm good. Surprise!
Yeah, I didn't - l-Yeah.
- Look at you, here.
- Sorry it took me so long.
- It did. It did.
- Yeah.
-  - Oh, I brought your-
I brought your umbrella back.
- And I got a surprise-
- Oh. I have a lot, but that's fine.
that I know you love.
Oh. Wow. That's, uh-
- That's -Wow. That's scary thoughtful.
-
- Thanks. Thank you.
- l-l-I know you love them. Twinkies.
- So, you-you-you came here all
the way just to see me? - Yes, sir.
"Ask and you shall receive."
You know who said that?
- No.
- Jesus.
- Did Jesus tell you to come here?
-
Jesus ask me to come here.
- No. You did.
- Oh. No. No.
- Yes, you did.
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.
- I don't think so.
Yes. Right after you fondled my breasts.
Remember?
- Who?
- You.  Remember?
- Oh.
- "Oh, life on the road sure is awful.
Sure would be great if you could
be out there with me."
-
- Oh, yeah.
With your big old hands.
Just grabbed my little puppies and-
- Yeah.
- went to town.
- It felt good.
- Good.
- Yeah.
- Uh, well, that's great.
Yeah. It will be great,
because you are making journalistic history-
- Oh. That's sweet of you to say.
- and I will be right by your side...
for- for support and encouragement...
and whatever, like...
- nurturing and-and coddling you
as a man should require. - Okay.
I'm -I'm pretty much a one-man team. It's just-
It's - It's just me and, uh, my camera.
God, yeah.
- You know what? And yes.
- Can't believe it.
You know,
the news- the news needs you. Look.
Because l-I bet my left ovary...
that that- that's Baby Peggy's daddy
leaving the hospital to avoid the press.
- Right there. Look.
- Oh, no, that's a nurse.
- No. Right- - No, they're all dressed
like- There's a lot of nurses.
- 'Cause we're at a hospital. - But a- But a
nurse not wearing sterilized nonslip footwear?
- What?
-
Oh! Ho-Holy shit! You're right.
- Yeah. l- I should, uh-Thank you.
- Go, Steven with a "V."
First priority, your-your occupation.
First priority, your-your occupation.
Second priority, fornication!
Fornication.
- Excuse me, ma'am.
- Yes. Ooh. Sorry?
- Only media are allowed up here.
- Oh. Absolutely.
My credentials, kind sir.
- "Cruciverbalist"?
- /.
- You gotta stay down there with your friends.
-
My friends.
Don't make us beg! Save the third leg!
- Don't make us beg! Save the third leg!
- Again!
-
-
Oh. Thanks.
Are you pro-leg or anti-leg?
Neither really.
Well, um, this is the pro-leg group over here.
Oh, we are supporting Baby Peggy's dad
in the fight to save the baby's third leg.
- Oh, wow. - Um, over there-Well,
those are the anti-leggers.
Well, is the, uh- is the additional leg
functioning or nonfunctioning?
Because if it has full mobility, it's both
a physical asset and a medical phenomenon.
Those are a lot of words.
- And they're kind of big. I don't understand.
- Sorry.
In addition to promoting a righteous cause...
the pro-leggers have better snacks.
Okay. I'm, um...
definitely pro-leg then.
Yea!
Come around.
You can help light the rest of the candles.
Okay. Okay.
Love those boots.
- Nice work.
-
- How'd you get that?
- Uh-
This is Hartman Hughes reporting from the edge.
You remember the blind date I went on?
- Yeah. The one who did the crossword.
- Yeah.
She followed me here.
- Here?
- Yeah, yeah.
I mean, I saw her at the bridge, and l- I think
she's with the protesters. She has red boots.
- Is she attractive?
- I mean, who cares?
I've been married to the same woman
for nine years. I care.
- I think she thinks that I invited her here.
- Did you?
No. I mean, well-
Kind of. I mean-
But I was just trying to be nice, you know,
to get her out of my truck.
You could have tried "Get out of my truck."
I can't be held responsible
for being a nice guy, right?
No. Of course not.
Unless she's doing a crossword all about you...
and following you
across the country like a stalker.
Stalker?
- Who has a stalker?
- Steve does. Big-time.
- No, no, no, no. What?
- Big-time.
Really? What's going on with that?
She was on me like a mountain lion in the truck.
Great in theory, but... wouldn't stop talking.
She was like a talking encyclopedia.
So, uh, is she here, or-
No. No, no, no. I think she went up-
Red boots, with the protesters. Hot.
Red boots?
- You bang a fireman?
- No.
No, I did not bang a fireman.
Hmm.
All right.
I'm gonna go outside...
and get some, uh, snacks.
- You want anything?
-
- Awesome. He's getting me drinks.
- You think that's where he's going?
- Yeah! - That's not where he's going.
I don't know what he's up to.
He's always thinking about something.
-
- This glue is making me high.
-  - It's the,
uh- It's the methylbenzene in there, Winston.
- Give me that.
-
- Here.
-
- Hey, guys.
- Oh, hi.
- Uh, can I help?
- Oh, sure.
Mary, have you met Howard?
Howard, Mary. Mary, Howard.
- How do you do?
- Uh, I'm not quite sure what you mean.
-
- Uh-
I'm just gonna sit down.
- So, what can I do?
- Can you, um- Can you do the ribbon?
- Yes.
- Okay. Here's scissors if you need them.
- Mary.
- Oh, hey. That's that news guy.
Hartman Hughes.
So, this is the pro-legger camp.
-  Yeah.
- Handsome group.
You folks are all for
keeping Baby Peggy abnormal.
- Abnormal?
- Extra legs equals extra awesomeness.
-
-
- She'd just be like the tree frog.
- Come again?
A trematode parasite causes polymely-
that means "extra limbs" - in-in tree frogs. Yeah.
Happens all the time. It's -It's totally normal.
- In some ponds,there's a quarter
of the tree frogs- - Hartman Hughes!
with extra limbs,
and sometimes they found that if-
You know, over at the media tent...
we're gonna take a break in a few minutes...
and, uh, sure enough like you to join me.
Oh.
I can't. Um, I have flute lessons.
Will Steve be there?
- Who do you think sent me?
- Oh.
Go on to that media tent with your bad self.
- I'll be right back.
-
- Did Steve tell you all about the
crossword I did for him? - Oh, yeah.
There's no words to describe
how much it meant to him.
Oh, but there are. There are always words.
- You know-
- Yes?
It's easy to see
why he fell for you the way he did.
Oh.
- So, he, uh- Oh, yeah.
-
he told you all about
the incredible connection and intensity...
- and je ne sais quoi?
- Oh, yeah.
-
- He told me about the quoi.
He wouldn't shut his piehole about the quoi.
- But, you know, his bliss is tempered with fear.
-
- Oh.
- When you saw him today...
did he seem like a man
whose heart and loins were full of joy?
- -
-
l- l-l-I don't know. I don't know if- if-
- Mmm, no.
- No.
- It's because he's afraid, Mary.
- Oh.
He's afraid you're gonna... break his heart.
But I wouldn't do that.
I wouldn't do that to Steve. I could never do that.
- I'm incapable-
- Shh.
You rest those pretty little mouth pillows, huh?
You're gonna need 'em later
for all sorts of naughtiness.
What I need to know from you right now...
are you gonna stick around long enough
to help us work through Steve's fear?
- Oh. Of course. Of course. Yes.
- Ah.
- If he tells you to go, you don't go.
- Mm-hmm. No? Okay.
Mm-mmm. He starts throwing words around
like "cuckoo" and "loony" and "crazy"...
- that's his fear talking.
- Oh.
- All right?
- Okay. Okay. Yes.
If he tries to run away, I want you to grab him.
- Okay. - And with the strength
that God gives you, hang on.
- Be calm and focused.
- Okay. Okay.
- You wanna know why?
- Why? Yeah. Why?
You're the rock in this relationship.
I'm the rock.
- You're the glue that holds it together.
- I'm the glue. Okay.
Right here. Look at me. Focus.
Are you gonna soldier on...
no matter what happens?
Of course.
- Of course.
- Good.
-  - You know what I see in those big,
beautiful eyes?
Plica semilunaris secretions?
Do I have something in my eye?
Bravery.
Hmm. Well, I'm a little nervous.
- Now you go get your Steve on.
- Okay. Okay.
-
- Yeah, she's really hyper.
That's good. That's good.
The calm and focused ones...
they keep all that bottled up inside,
and before you know it-
You know? But as long as she's hyper,
you don't have to worry about it.
One thing she isn't is calm.
-  Dude.
- Something you wanna tell me?
- Dude. Is that her?
- Hmm?
Is that her?
Oh.
Want some?
Okay.
- How'd she get in here?
-  I don't know. She's calm.
Boy, did I miss you, Steven with a "V."
- Let's go for a talk outside.
- Okay. Walkie-talk.
- Right out here.
- Okay.
-
- All right.
- Oops. Yes?
- Okay.
- You can't stay here.
- Sure I can.
- No.
- That's the beauty of my job. I can send in...
- crossword puzzles from anywhere in the world.
- No. Listen. Listen. Okay.
- Listen to me.
- Mm-hmm?
I don't want you here. Okay?
But you said.
I said- I know- I'm a guy. Okay?
We say things we don't mean.
Well, then, how do I know
you mean what you're saying now...
- when you said you didn't mean what you said?
- That's crazy.
Well, see, that's your fear talking.
Why are you so calm?
How come you're not more hyper?
That's freaking me out a bit. I gotta be honest.
- Steve, it's all gonna be okay.
- I know it is, if you-
Maybe even wonderful.
- Hartman Hughes told me everything.
- What?
- I talked to Hartman Hughes.
- When did you talk to him?
- It doesn't matter.
- Did he- Did he come get you?
- Steve.
- Where is he? Hughes.
Steven, Steven, Steven, Steven. Come here.
Look at me. You here? Are you here with me?
- Okay.
- Focus. Right here. Okay? Look at me.
"Intimate relationships
cannot substitute for a life plan...
"but to have any meaning or validity at all...
a life plan must include intimate relationships."
Do you know who said that?
- Jesus?
- Harriet Lerner.
- Oh.
- Psychologist, lecturer and author...
of the timeless classic
- I was gonna run for governor, but-
- Hey, Hughes.
- Come here.
-
- Come here.
- Steve.
- Yes, sir.
- This another one of your pranks? Huh?
I don't know what you're into, lago,
but you better tell her the truth, okay?
I'm a newsman.
I'm incapable of saying anything but the truth.
Okay. Well, then tell her you lied and-
and that I really-
I don't want you here. I'm sorry.
Okay.
- Sorry. Just...
- ##
-
- You're gonna find a great guy.
Baby.
What is that?
I want you guys to have a baby.
Why?
You guys belong together.
- I'm gonna hit you, man.
- Aw, come on.
You're not gonna hit the face of CCN-
Stop it! "Victory attained through violence
is tantamount to defeat, for it is momentary."
- This is what I'm talking about.
- Do you know who said it? Gandhi. Gandhi.
- What are you afraid of?
- What am I afraid of?
You don't want her to know about
"I heart Mary" carved in a tree trunk?
Why are you putting stuff like that in her head?
- You said that?
- No, I never said that.
Maybe you're afraid the great Hartman Hughes
is gonna steal her away.
- You're crazy!
- I'm like Helen ofTroy. No fights!
Hey, guys!
Baby Peggy's parents settled.
- Steve, your camera.
- Oh, Jesus, Angus!
- Sorry. Sorry.
- See what happens?
You mess with me, you mess with my boy.
- Mary, stay! Mary, stay!
- But you-
- Mary!
-
-  Mary!
-
Tissue.
With mere hours to spare,
the Agueros reconciled...
agreeing to halt surgery until Baby Peggy
is old enough to decide for herself.
It's time for the Agueros
to be a family once again.
So today, like the noble tree frog...
whose third leg is nothing if not natural...
Baby Peggy marches on
with her three-legged life.
Steve! I'm coming. Excuse me.
Possible concussion, could faint at any time.
- Steve, I'm coming.
- No, no. Ma'am, you can't go back there.
Could someone please help him?
Maybe apply a vasoconstrictor
or a nasal tampon? Please.
- She trying to kill me? She's trying to kill me.
-
This is Hartman Hughes report-
What the hell was that?
It's this girl who Steve invited, sir.
I didn't invite her. She's stalking me.
Never mind.
There's a hurricane off the coast ofTexas.
Get to it.
I'm sorry. It'll never happen again.
If you three weren't the closest crew to
Galveston, you'd be hitchhiking home by now.
- Yes, sir.
- Get off the phone.
Did you hear that about the tree frog?
Every time she speaks, I smell anchor desk.
I get it, Hartman. You're trying
to get back at me, but Mary's not the way.
She's insane. She tried to kill me.
Hartman, something's wrong with her.
- You didn't see that?
- You fell down. Boo-hoo.
I fell down? My legs were
taken out from under me.
What are you talking about? She's stalking me.
-
-
Oh, shit!
Tell her I'm not here. Tell her I'm not here.
- Steve. Hi, guys.
-  Hello, Mary.
Hi. I'm so sorry I was detained.
But all's been resolved. Steve.
Considering you almost cost us our job,
maybe now's not a great time.
I'm so sorry.
I could call your employer and apologize.
I can actually apologize
in 17 different languages.
- Huh.
-
So, Mary, we're going to Galveston.
There's a big storm there.
- What do you know about Galveston?
- What are you doing?
Great. Galveston.
Well, Galveston's the South's new gay mecca-
one of the country's
top 10 gay-friendliest cities.
- Huh. Gay friendly, Angus.
- Yeah. Hi, Steve.
Is she running alongside the van?
- What else you got?
-
-
- Really?
Over 6,000 dead in Galveston alone. Yeah.
Ten- Can I have that?
- Ten nuns and 90 orphans.
-
- Ask her why she's following me. Please.
- Why are you stalking him?
I'm not-
I'm not stalking. No, I'm not stalking.
Stalking's an obsessive pursuit of prey.
But you're kind of
following alongside his van.
Who wouldn't?
Steven is a smart, decent, loving-
If he allows himself, right?
Loving, talented human being
with deep-seated fears.
-
- Mary.
- Steve, hi.
- Go home. Go.
Oh.
You should come!
We didn't get to light all the candles, Howard.
- That's okay. We can save them.
- Okay. Ooh.
Hi, Mary. Where you been?
I'm -I'm going to-
I'm going to go meet Steve at his next job.
- Oh.
- Yeah. Galveston.
- Yes, it's a storm.
-
Could you sign my autograph
book before you go?
Yeah, if I, uh- If I had a- a car...
where they have the world's largest peanut.
I love peanuts, especially the giant ones.
- Yeah, well, who doesn't?
- I know.
Love them.
-
- I'll drive.
- Really?
- Yeah, why not?
All right. Vamoose.
Vamoose indeed.
- So, uh, what kind of car do you have?
- A Gremlin.
- What year?
- '76.
- Did you replace the two-wire
ignition connector? - Yes.
The reverse doesn't work, and sometimes
it stalls. But otherwise, it's good as new.
This storm could be nasty.
Are we sure that we wanna drive into it?
Come on. How bad could it be, right?
-
-
And what makes this situation
even more frightening-
that area ofTexas currently in the midst...
of the worst tornado season in history.
- And here's where things get interesting.
-
-
-
Did you know that back in the '80s when
everyone's concern was with the aerosol cans...
it was actually the cows and their gases...
which were actually
doing the most damage to the ozone layer?
-
-
A little wrinkled old lady.
Yeah, that's Mother Teresa.
She's my best seller.
- I'm an apple sculptor.
-
I love apples.
- Yeah?
- I do.
Well, I went to school for physics,
but I got bored.
So I, uh- So now I just make these and
sell them on AppleHeadsRule. com.
- Oh! Clay Aiken!
-
I love him!
You know, I was sitting at home...
just thinking that I had
everything I needed right there.
And then I just thought,
maybe there's more, you know?
Maybe this is the road I'm supposed to be on.
Maybe it is.
Hartman, not getting too wet, are you?
Paula, the only thing keeping me
from falling into the bottomless depths...
of these shark-infested waters...
is this flimsy two-by-four railing.
will not surpass the storm of 1900...
when 6,000 people lost their lives-
nuns, orphans washed out to sea.
This is Hartman Hughes in Galveston...
in the middle of a mild storm...
All right. Good work.
- Good job.
- Happy to help!
- Holy shit! There's Mary!
- Where?
- You know, you're an asshole!
- Hmm!
You know what? I love dressing up. I do.
But, guys, those panties are short on sparkle.
Thank the good Lord for the BeDazzler.
- Guys? Hold on!
-
- Oh, crap!
-  Oh, God!
-
-
The car won't start! Reverse doesn't work!
- Oh, my God!
- Put it in drive!
- I can't! It's stalled!
- Okay. Oh, God!
Okay, okay. Uh- Uh-
-
-
- Okay. Okay.
- Get out!
Guys, come on!
- My shoe!
-  Give me your hand!
Ow, ow, ow!
Come on! Keep running!
- Come on!
- We have to hurry!
Everybody get in!
Get in and go all the way down! Hurry!
It's blocked!
We're gonna be okay though.
We're gonna be fine.
Yea! Ponchos!
-
- Oh!
Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh.
-
-
Oh. Oh! Oh!
Insecta Hemiptera
of the suborder Auchenorrhyncha!
Cicada.
This species only comes around every 17 years!
it's like a once-in-a-lifetime natural miracle!
- Do you know how lucky we are?
- Cool.
Shit!
-
- My car.
- Storm's over. What else is happening?
- All quiet.
Hey, Chris, any celebrities
arrested for drunk driving today?
Give me the phone.
Angus, how in the hell
do you miss a "tornadocane"?
- Please, give us another chance. - If you
keep this up, you're leaving me no choice.
- Please, sir, l- - Get me downed street signs,
damaged boats, drowned puppies-
whatever.
And then I want you all in my office
Tuesday morning at 9:00.
- Sir, I'm sorry, sir, l-
-
They're through, all of them. Finished.
Find out if Vasquez is happy at NNC.
We need to go shoot some B-roll
of the storm damage.
I'm not scared of love.
I went on one date with her, Mom.
I went on one date with her.
A complete waste of my handsome gifts.
Where's a decent tragedy
when you need one, huh?
Hey, kids. Who's ready for some fun?
No!
You can knit this handy purse.
- But my favorite project-
- Sorry. We're gonna have to interrupt.
Breaking news from Silver Plume, Colorado.
A group of hearing-impaired children
have plummeted into an abandoned mine shaft.
-  - Yeah, I just heard.
Who are we sending to cover it?
What?
-
- Is there no one else?
-
- Now that's a great story.
-
- Angus, where'd you get those?
- Hmm?
- Mary could have planted those.
- Think she poisoned our chips?
- Well, can you prove that she didn't?
Huh? Did you buy them? I didn't buy them.
Did you buy-
You don't buy anything. Did you buy them?
Are you kidding me?
- Nope.
- Hey!
Everything's gotta go out.
We gotta flush it. We gotta flush it, guys.
Give a hoot. Don't pollute.
- I'm sorry.
- It's not your fault.
You know, my old man was
a combat journalist in 'Nam.
Got killed before I ever had a chance
to say good-bye to him.
Yeah, if I ever get that anchor desk...
he's gonna be really proud of me in heaven.
Well, looks like we found
the eye of the storm, guys.
Holy shit. There's Mary.
Oh, my God. It's Steve. Steve.
- Steve.
-
- What are you doing? What?
- Getting some air.
I'm making some notes! Leave me alone!
-  - Stop it! - No way!
Steve! Steve! Steve! Steve!
Oh, Jesus! She's got a machete!
Where the hell did she get a machete?
Oh, my God! She's gonna cut my feet off!
I'm not gonna be able to walk!
She's gonna make me eat my legs!
She's gonna make you eat your legs?
- Yeah, I read about it!
- Oh, really?
What, some sort of pimento leg loaf?
- Hey! You think this is funny?
I've read up on this! -
- -
- Just shut up. Just shut up.
Just shut up! Just shut the heck up!
- I swear to-
- Shut up! All right?
Jesus! Where do I begin?
Hartman, for the love of God, stop tanning.
You look like a Cheese Nip!
You look like a wrinkled peach!
And you! Geraldo! Lose the wig!
You look like a retired porn star.
The van's the same, dumb-ass!
Mary is not a psycho the psycho.
She's just a smart girl with red boots.
Okay. Ooh. Okay.
"Deaf kids in a mine. Silver Plume.
Please 'meat' me."
"Meat."
"Please meat" - M-E-A-T.
See? He needs me,
if only to help with his spelling.
You know what one of my favorite ingredients
of crosswording is? Perseverance.
If you quit a puzzle, you can't finish it.
Sure, every once in a while,
you run into a doozy...
that you don't think you could ever solve
in a million years...
but if you stick with it, you figure it out.
Eventually.
Worst thing you can do is leave it unfinished.
It's never the solution, is it?
-  - You know what my
favorite part of a crossword is?
When you realize you know something
you didn't think you knew.
-
- Maybe.
To Colorado then?
-
-  Yea!
Hey, people, back it up!
This ground can collapse at any time,
so please, please back it up!
Vasquez.
Hey, what's he doing with his hands?
Son of a bitch.
I haven't had my big moment yet,
so I gotta find something.
-
- They're all okay!
All right, on three.
Three, two, one.
Elation here in Colorado...
and yet danger lurking at every corner...
as rescuers bring the "besmudged"
little cherubs up one at a time.
Thank God they're all right.
Thank you, God.
- That's the last of them!
-
He's out.
- Oh!
-
"Is my family in danger
from an abandoned mine?
Yeah.
Well. "Truth is truth, to the end of reckoning."
Shakespeare.
And I say to these complete strangers-
- Bye.
- Bye.
...one that has left parents
across this country wondering...
"How do I keep my family safe
from abandoned mines?
-
Holy shit.
on top
of an abandoned mine?
"Is my child's school built
on top of an abandoned mine?
-
-
- Mary's in the hole.
- Don't be ridiculous.
-
-
-  Get back from the tape now!
- What?
Did somebody fall in the mine?
Tell her help is on the way.
We're working on getting a new crane.
We just need her to confirm she's conscious.
Here. Give me that.
-
-
Okay, I am not afraid.
I'm not afraid, nor am I affrightened.
Okay.
Uh-
Hello!
It is me, Mary Horowitz.
Yes, I seem to have fallen into the mine.
Hello? Everyone?
It's, uh, me, Mary Horowitz. Hello?
-
- People, please move back.
-
-
So she just dove in that hole, like a gopher.
No, dude, not like a gopher.
Like a human being.
She was running after me,
and she fell in the hole.
That shot of Steve's girlfriend
falling into the pit is priceless.
We've got the inside advantage here,
so let's use it.
Get Steve ready to go on
and talk about his girlfriend...
as soon as we get the graphics together.
Fifteen minutes.
-  Here he comes!
- You people are ruining the ferns!
Can you comment on the rumors that Mary's fall
into the mine was a suicide attempt?
Well-That's ridiculous. Not our Mary.
The word "depression" is not in her vocabulary.
All right, obviously it is in her vocabulary.
But no. No.
She-She never lets anything get her down.
Still living at home at her age-
clearly not a normal situation.
Not normal?
We-We love having her here.
- Yes. Yes, we love having her here.
- Yes, we do.
Fumigation can't be rushed.
-
- One more question!
Now, I don't wanna speculate here...
-
-  Ow! Ow! Ow!
I don't wanna speculate either,
but, yes, absolutely, it could.
And as we await the tragic
fate of Mary Horowitz...
attention now on the boots she was wearing
when she slipped into the mine...
a story I couldn't tell
until I'd walked a mile in Mary's shoes.
Take a look.
It's hour one, and it's as if
my feet have been placed in vise grips.
We're at the two-hour mark,
and, actually, right now I feel pretty-
Oh!
-
-
light."'
Oh. Voilà. Yes.
Yes, it's perfect. Yes. This is per-
Ah! Oh!
You scared the crap out of me.
Hi. I'm -I'm sorry.
Uh, can you, uh-
Can you- Can you hear me? I mean, at all?
Do you have sensory-neural hearing loss...
or do you have conductive?
Because if-if it-
She doesn't hear me. Okay.
You know, I understand
a little bit of sign language...
so if you wanna-you know? No? Okay.
Um, "Deaf people can do anything
except for hear."
Do you know who said that?
Dr. Jordan-
first deaf president at Gallaudet U.
Yeah. Maybe you'll go there one day.
If we both don't perish in here.
Hold on. I'll be right back.
You stay here, okay? Okay? Right.
-
a piece of paper, a number two pencil.
This is Hartman Hughes reporting from the edge.
Cut. Corbitt wants you on next.
I told you I am not her boyfriend, Angus.
Yeah, but you're the one that encouraged her
to come here to begin with.
- You're the one that asked her to come here,
not me! - Guys! Guys!
NNC has got their hands
on everything but her panty size.
- What?
- Our Mary?
- Yes.
- Son of a bitch. Vasquez scooped
Behold, notice of our imminent rescue.
Oh, okay. Okay.
This is good news. This is good news, okay?
They're going to tell us something wonderful.
And it says, "Mary, are you" -
Oh.
That's a good sign right there.
-
- Oh, God!
What's it say, son?
Millions of people are watching.
Um, okay.
"I think you mean, am I conscious?
Not, am I conscience?
"'Conscience' is your inner morality gauge...
"you know, the thing
that stops you from doing bad things...
e.g., killing, stealing,
harming helpless animals and whatnot."
- Can we leave her down there?
-
"To answer your question, yes, I am conscious.
-
- "My leg is bleeding, though I'll probably live.
- Yours truly, Mary Horowitz."
- Yes!
"P.S. Did anyone lose a little deaf girl?
I found one. She's fine,
other than not being able to hear, I mean."
They missed a child? Can't these people count?
Thank God for this woman Mary Horowitz.
Let's bring up that picture of her again.
Yesterday, Mary Horowitz.
Today, Mary Horowitz- hero.
- -
-  I'm coming to save you!
speculation as to whether or not Mary
intentionally heaved herself into the mine...
to save the poor deaf child...
after rescuers ignored her
desperate, desperate pleas.
Steve's girlfriend, Mary Horowitz...
struggling for her life
down in the abandoned mine, as we speak.
She's not my girlfriend, and I'm not
gonna say that just to get ratings. Okay?
Yeah, and the truth is
I don't really even wanna do this.
These words also described
Ted Kaczynski, the Unabomber.
However, you never know about these people.
They're clean-cut-
But people deserve to know the truth about her.
I mean, she sees things that other people don't.
And she's kind, and-
and I think she means well...
even though, when she does things,
they're just a little unusual.
And she's smart. She's supersmart.
And not in a freakish way. In-
Like, she has a gift.
I mean, she knows everything...
everything but whom not to trust
and how not to get hurt and-
and how to survive us.
And she doesn't pretend to be
somebody that she's not.
And she certainly doesn't
deserve to be where she is now.
-
-
-
Yeah. The tracks down there just-
just keep going and going down and-
-  - If we just concentrate
on this and that and that, then we'll-
But not to- not to worry.
I'll- I'll get us out of here.
Hope that crane gets here soon.
I hope so too.
'Cause if there's carbon monoxide down there-
But the air's coming through the top.
Even at concentrations of five ppm,
they could suffocate.
I am so sorry.
- She has stolen a little piece of my heart.
-
-  - The stress
fractures are worsening by the minute.
The longer they're down there,
the greater the chance of collapse.
They thought the air quality was bad...
try a 50-foot span of rock and earth
dropping down there.
Oh, Jesus.
That's a bunch of horseshit.
She's gonna be fine.
Odds are she won't. We gotta go on.
What are we gonna say?
Say she's not gonna make it?
Her whole family is watching, Angus. Christ.
- I'll be back in a minute.
- Hughes.
All right, two minutes. That's it.
-
- Some blind date, huh?
Here's a candle.
Hi, Winston.
I think I'll feel better
if I pretend that it's Mary's surprise party.
I'm making an apple head for Mary
for when she gets out.
- And she's gonna get out.
-
-
-
Helicopters are out of the question
because of all the power lines.
Hope is fading fast.
The earth tremors
are getting stronger. They have to get out soon.
The other side. Oh!
Ouch too.
I can't do this. I can't get us out of here.
Guess what.
Mary Horowitz doesn't have the answers.
Or a job.
And-And my job mattered!
I was the
crossword constructor...
and I threw it all away- for what?
"Mary, Steve wants you to come be with us.
He needs you."
Really? Methinks the media lies.
-
- A little.
Words, people. Words.
There are meaningful words,
there are pointless words...
and then there are words that hurt.
"Mary, why can't you be like every other girl?"
"Mary, why do you talk like that?"
-
Oh, oh! Oh! Oh!
And the pièce de résistance, yes.
"Mary, why do you wear
those stupid red boots all the time?"
You wanna know why? Huh?
Do you wanna know why?
Okay, I will tell you why.
like 10 friends on a camping trip.
That's why I wear them.
We're finished.
The ground is gonna collapse.
We're gonna perish.
I just wanna go home.
Sorry.
I know.
I know.
Ma'am, I'm sorry.
You're gonna have to step back.
-
- Not now.
You brought her here. And if she dies-
This is just a fence.
Being on that side of it
doesn't make you any better.
You did that.
...cheated on her taxes-
...and the red boots-
Mary-
she did this.
He was my ticket to normal.
Yeah.
"Why would you want to be normal?"
I don't. I don't.
These will keep you warm.
Yeah.
"Maybe someone will figure out how to save us."
Maybe. Maybe.
Say that again.
"Maybe someone" -
"Maybe." "Maybe."
Little deaf girl,
it's time for us to go home.
Why aren't they doing anything?
How much- How much do you weigh?
Fifty pounds, give or take? Okay.
See.
Okay, just get it right down here.
Just get all over the joints.
When I got kicked out of Girl Scouts...
and all the other girls were
learning how to sell cookies...
I was at home- ow- reading physics books.
Voilà.
It's my fault Mary's in the hole.
But like Patton said...
"A bad plan violently executed today...
is better than a great plan tomorrow."
So, I'm gonna pull the lever,
push the cart...
and up we go, okay?
I'm coming, Mary Horowitz! I'm coming!
I'm coming to save you!
-
- What the-
One, two-
Oh! Okay! Pretty good drop.
You guys doing all right?
Mm-hmm. But we were just on-on, you know-
Something just touched me! Something bit me!
Something- Help!
There's something in that water.
Something ni-nibbled at my leg.
Hartman Hughes just jumped-
I repeat, jumped into the mine.
he literally dove right into the mine.
All eyes now not only on Mary Horowitz...
but also CCN reporter Hartman Hughes.
Why the hell didn't I think of that?
Did you check the perimeter for spiders?
Uh, yes. Yes, I did.
It's really... scary down here.
You know, if my old man could see me now.
I'm sorry.
I mean, I got you into this.
Thanks.
Um, how much do you weigh?
I'll be cradling her here,
and I'll be cradling you here.
Maybe you-you would like
to be holding us like this when we go up.
No, no. It's your plan,
and I don't wanna take the credit.
- I'd like to take the credit.
- Okay. All right.
-  - I don't know.
He said something about Patton and a bad plan.
- Did you see the cable just move? -
Please do notjump into the mine!
Get the camera right now.
We- Steve!
That cable's moving. Looks like they're coming
up. Is there anything I can do to help out?
- We're doing everything we can.
- I know, but can it take all that weight?
-
-
- Okay.
- All set.
- All right.
- Okay.
- You ready?
- Are you ready?
- Yeah. I just hope this works.
- Yeah, you and me.
- Hold on.
- What's up?
Oh. Thank you. Appreciate that.
Thank you. I'm camera-ready.
Okay. All right.
-
- Okay.
Three, two, one.
-
-
The crane is beginning to tilt over.
I think they're coming up!
It's hard to tell what's going on.
-
-
- Oh, my God! Mary!
- Oh, my God!
-
-  It's her!
- Whoo!
-
-
-
-  They're safe!
- Ah!
-
-
-
- Look at him!
Come on, pull! Let's go!
Hartman Hughes!
Everything feels so wonderful.
Looks like we're gonna have to
give her her job back.
Our own Hartman Hughes
becoming the hero of this story...
risking his own life
to save the life of Mary Horowitz...
and an unidentified little girl.
I'm gonna have to make that idiot anchor.
There you go. You okay?
-
- Okay.
- Thanks, Mary.
- You're welcome.
- Hey.
- Yeah?
- Have a nice life.
- Okay.
- Mary. Are you okay?
- Yes. Yes, I am.
Uh, a few lacerations...
but I was able to tourniquet them off
with this bandanna I found.
I never should've said anything to you
that, uh, I didn't mean.
Uh, I'm sorry.
Um-
- Oh.
- Here.
Thank you for the loan.
You're welcome.
I have to go.
- Okay.
- Bye.
Bye.
Mary?
Don't ever change- for anybody.
I'm Jewish-Catholic.
I'm pretty much set in stone.
-
-
Mary! Mary! Mary!
Oh, my goodness!
- You're okay!
-
I missed you guys so much! Oh, God!
Mary Horowitz.
Angus. Let's finish this.
-
- Move aside. Move aside.
Hey! Get in here!
Ah. It's good to see you guys.
- Come here, Steve. Come on, buddy.
- No, no.
Good to see you. Okay, all right.
- Come on. Confessional.
- Let's do this.
Hartman Hughes,
you reminded us to believe in miracles.
What does it feel like to be a hero?
I'm not a hero.
I'm a humble guy who's lucky to be alive.

patriotic American
would've jumped in that hole...
once he knew, uh, there was
a little girl down there...
- and a good-looking lady, single, huh?

We love you!
