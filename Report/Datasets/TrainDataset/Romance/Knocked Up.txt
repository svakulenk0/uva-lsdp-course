Light your nuts on fire.
Fuck! Fuck! My hands!
Too hot for Jonah!
I got fucking water
in my mouth!
Oh, my God!
I got to get off! I got
to get off! Got to get off!
Got to get off!
Sadie, wake up!
Oh, my gosh!
Daddy, wake up!
Okay, I'm up.
Is that my genius over here?
Is that my genius?
I need you to take the kids
to school this morning.
I would, but I'm supposed
to work out.
What?
Yeah. I got an appointment
with a trainer. I can't cancel
it now. He'll charge me.
You didn't tell me that.
Yeah, I did.
Last week I told you.
You didn't tell me.
I did. And then I wrote it
on the calendar
like you told me to.
No, you didn't tell me.
I did tell you.
Well, you didn't,
but what are we gonna do,
'cause I have an appointment?
So you're taking
the kids to school.
Don't use the baby
to cover your tracks.
I can drive them.
I'll drive them to school.
Thank you very much.
Great. Good.
You turned my sister
into a limo driver.
I don't mind.
It all worked out!
What are you giggling about?
Be quiet.
You're starting to annoy me.
Poo poo.
Ladies. Be nice.
You know what
I did the other day?
ALLlSON: What?
I googled "murder."
You googled "murder"?
Yeah.
Why?
I mean, what did it say?
It didn't say anything.
It just showed pictures
of people lying dead
on the floor and blood
everywhere, and...
That was just ketchup.
Who wants to hear some music?
I want to hear Rent.
I want to hear Green Day!
No, we're listening to Rent!
Well, I want to listen
to Green Day.
I got your baby!
Don't taunt her. Come on.
Here.
Sadie! Why did you just
do that? Don't throw
things at your sister!
She hit me.
Did you hit her?
I did not.
Make her happy. It's okay.
It won't make her happy.
It's okay. It's okay.
She spilled all the
marbles on the floor.
Well, give her
her marble back.
All right? Are you sure
you understand
the terms of the bet?
Because this is serious.
No.
Martin, all right, listen.
You don't shave your beard
or cut your hair for one year,
and if you can do that,
I will pay your rent.
But if you shave,
then you have to pay
all five of our rents.
Thanks for
the free money, bitch.
Hey, Martin, was it weird
when you joined the Taliban,
being American
and everything like that?
Like when you see
a woman driving a car,
do you just get pissed?
Just watch your back, Serpico.
You never know
who your friends are.
Okay, all right. You guys
can't make fun of me
the whole time.
But, Martin, it's a competition.
It's called the Dirty Man Competition.
We're gonna make fun of you
until you shave the beard.
That's the rules.
That's the whole point.
You're supposed to be
tempted into shaving.
Your face looks
like Robin Williams' knuckles.
You guys aren't allowed
to make fun of me.
It's not part of the rules.
Martin, why didn't you
just listen to me when
I was explaining the rules?
You just looked
at me with that
blank stare of yours.
It was like talking
to a wax statue.
BEN: Okay, guys, are you ready?
So, "Only at
fleshofthestars.com will
customers be able to find
"exactly how long
into what movies their
favorite stars are exposed."
MARTlN: Nice.
Oh, fucking brilliant.
Pretty good, right?
Yeah. Yeah, ka-ching.
JAY: We're in.
All right, guys,
let start logging, all right?
Charles Manson?
Do you have
any other thoughts?
Good, awesome,
let's start this off
with a bang.
Jamie Lee Curtis. I got
an hour and 10 minutes
into Trading Places.
Both chesticles.
I got Julianne
"Red Beard" Moore.
Short Cuts, two hours,
Julianne Moore special.
She loves it.
I've seen that,
and from the look of her bush,
Short Cuts is the wrong
name for that movie.
Nice.
Nice. Nice. Well done.
Her bush looks like
the hedge maze
from The Shining but red
and without
Scatman Crothers in it.
Red Bush.
Red Bush.
SEACREST: So if you want that
perfect tan like the stars,
he's the one to see.
We'll be right back
on E! News. Stay with us.
Okay.
Okay, is Jessica Simpson
here yet?
Let me check. Let me see.
Is she on her way?
She's left her house?
Hey, guys?
Okay, let me know
when she's pulling in.
She's about to pull in.
Is she camera-ready?
Is she camera-ready?
If she's gonna be in hair
and makeup for three hours,
I can't do it.
I'm not gonna be here.
I got to do American Idol.
It's live. I got to do it.
I got to be there.
What are we gonna
interview her about?
Nothing personal.
No personal questions.
No personal questions.
Don't ask her about her sister
and her nose job.
No plastic surgery questions.
No plastic...
No personal questions.
She doesn't want to talk about
her boobs or her father's
comments about her boobs.
Great. We'll talk about
the Middle East and maybe
an idea of an exit strategy.
Maybe she has a good pitch.
Should I ask her about Korea?
Maybe have her point it
out to us on a globe?
I don't understand
the young talent in this town!
It doesn't make any sense.
I got four jobs.
Hell, I'm more famous
than half the people
we talk to, anyway!
No one stands up.
No one has the balls
to sit them down
and say,
"Look, just cut the shit."
But everybody works for them.
They're all on the payroll.
They're all sucking the teat!
Nobody sits them down,
eye-to-eye, one-on-one,
and says, "Cut the shit."
And all these stars
just fuck it up.
That's what they do.
They fuck my day up!
And it pisses me off.
And now I'm sweating.
Okay, you want to...
You know what?
You want us to just come
and get you
when she gets here?
You want to head to
the green room for a minute?
Just chill out? Okay.
Yeah. That's a good idea.
Want us to bring you anything?
You want some water?
You want a cookie?
Cookie, yeah, cookie. Thanks.
Okay, we'll get you a cookie.
Sorry. I'm sorry. I'm pissed.
ALLlSON: What do we got?
Chocolate chip?
Allison?
Yeah.
Jack and I need
to see you in his office.
Okay.
Thanks for coming in, Allison.
Well, we wanted
to talk to you today
because we had a little debate
on the conference call
with New York about you.
You... About me?
You were talking about me?
We were wondering
aloud to one another
whether or not you would
be good for on camera.
What'd you decide?
They... They decided
that they like you,
and they would like
to put you on camera.
Really?
I know.
I was so surprised, too.
Oh, my God.
This is the best news ever.
Thank you so much.
This is great!
Congratulations.
Thank you.
I'll take that smile
as a "Yes, I'll do it."
Absolutely. I'm so excited!
Oh, my God.
It's a lot of work. Can't wait
to see what happens.
It's gonna be tough.
Tough job.
About the work,
most immediately,
there's gonna be
some things that you're
gonna be able to get...
ALLlSON: Okay.
...that other people
in the office don't get.
One of them, gym membership.
You want me to lose weight?
No, I don't
want you to lose weight.
No. We can't legally
ask you to do that.
We didn't say lose weight.
I might say tighten.
Tight.
A little tighter?
Just like toned and smaller.
Don't make everything smaller.
I don't want to
generalize that way.
Tighter.
We don't want you
to lose weight. We just
want you to be healthy.
Okay.
You know, by eating less.
We would just like it
if you go home
and step on a scale
and write down
how much you weigh
and subtract it by, like, 20.
Twenty.
And then weigh that much.
Just remember,
you've got it here,
you've got it here
and everybody's gonna
see you right there.
Yay! That's so exciting!
Oh, my God!
Hey!
Huh?
I got a promotion.
Oh, congratulations!
Thank you.
Hey, maybe you can
get your own place now.
Let's not get ahead
of ourselves.
Yay!
Let's go celebrate.
Okay. Let's do it.
Pete'll watch the kids?
Yeah!
We can watch
Taxicab Confessions.
What are you gonna do?
I don't know!
I'm so excited!
I walked in on him
masturbating one night.
Did he get the
deer-in-the-headlights look?
Did he freeze
or did he finish?
No, he tried to pretend
like he wasn't doing
anything under the covers.
Oh, no!
I buy these nice towels,
and he whacks off into them.
Deb and Pete, forever.
And...
And once he does that
into them once,
they're never soft ever again.
I can always tell if I'm
looking good based on
whether or not we get in.
Ladies?
Guess we're looking good.
If I didn't get in,
I would've lost my shit.
What's going on, man?
How long you gonna
make us wait out here,
for Christ's sake?
What the fuck?
You know what movie I just
saw again the other day,
which is fucking, like,
mind-blowing,
and I haven't seen it
since it came out is Munich.
Oh, Munich!
Oh, man, Munich fucking rules.
Munich is awesome!
That movie was Eric Bana
kicking fucking ass!
Dude, every movie with Jews,
we're the ones getting killed.
Munich flips it on its ear.
We're capping motherfuckers.
Not only killing but fucking,
like, taking names.
If any of us get laid tonight,
it's because
of Eric Bana in Munich.
I agree with that.
I agree.
You know what is not
helping us get laid
is the shoe bomber,
Richard Reid,
over here at our table.
BEN: I don't like your shoes.
How is Burning Man this year?
Fuck you guys.
I'm glad I'm not Jewish.
So are we.
Yeah, so are we.
Yeah. Fine, screw it.
You weren't chosen
for a reason.
Yeah.
It's like everyone
in here is 1 2 years old.
Am I too old to be here?
What?
Am I too old to be here?
No, of course not.
Does it look weird
that I'm here?
No, not at all.
Am I hotter than
these little bitches?
Yes! You look amazing.
Guys in here would
fuck me, right?
Yes.
That's weird to say,
but it makes me feel better.
You look hot.
Okay. I believe you.
Okay. I'm getting us drinks.
Okay.
Yo, a beer over here, please?
You're gonna be embarrassed
when you realize
I'm Wilmer Valderrama.
God.
Hey, hey! Excuse me!
He's literally ignoring
this entire half of the bar.
Don't even bother.
Yeah, awesome.
A beer over here, please?
He looked at us!
Did you see that?
Yeah, that was rough.
Oh, my God. And if
you can't get service,
what am I gonna do, you know?
Great. It's gonna be
that night.
Okay, you want a beer?
Yeah, just...
Well, I'm... Watch this.
Okay? Just observe.
There you go.
Come on, man.
Here you go. For your trouble.
Thank you. There you go.
Thank you.
Okay, enjoy it.
Are you sure?
I am sure.
I tried that once before
at the Comedy Store,
and I got punched in the ear.
Thanks a lot.
Oh, fuck, fuck!
I'm supposed
to get one for my sister.
Oh, here, take mine.
No, that's okay. I'll wait.
Please, I very rarely
look cool. This is a big
moment for me. Just take it.
Thank you. Awesome.
No problem.
I'm Allison.
I'm Ben.
Well, have a great night.
Yeah, you, too.
Thanks for the beer.
Okay, enjoy, be nice to them.
Bye. Thanks again.
I'll see you.
No, I'll see you later.
No, I won't
'cause I'm a pussy.
What's up, Ben?
That girl. She totally
gave me an opening, man,
and I locked up.
I just want to get
shit-faced tonight,
though, you know.
I'll just jerk it later.
It's cool.
Are you fucking crazy, man?
She looks smart.
Who's that she's sitting with?
It's her sister.
Her sister?
Yeah.
Dude, it's the dream.
What are we doing
standing here, man?
Let's go. Come on, follow me.
You stay here. Stay here.
Why?
Because your face
looks like a vagina.
Dick!
Hey, which one's
the sister?
Hey, Crockett,
you still partying
with Tubbs these days?
Come on, man. I'm getting
it from all angles here.
I don't like it anymore.
I know. I don't, either.
Was it weird when you changed
your name from Cat Stevens
to Yusuf lslam?
Yeah, it was really awkward.
All right, man.
I got to take off.
See you, Scorsese-on-coke.
What's that?
Chewbacca.
You know, it's Chewie.
Oh, another beard joke.
Fuck.
Fucking hilarious!
Hey.
Hey.
Hi, this is my friend, Jason.
I just wanted to see
how my beers were doing.
This is my sister, Debbie.
Oh, hi, I'm Ben.
Hi. Ben?
Yes.
Nice to meet you.
How you doing?
Good, how are you?
Just trying not to stare.
She's married.
Why do you have to say that?
What?
It's a shame.
You're beautiful.
Thank you.
She has two kids, too.
Shut up!
What? It's nothing
to be ashamed of.
You think that's gonna
stop him from hitting on her?
It's not at all.
I love kids.
Really?
Yeah, absolutely.
Excuse me.
Hello?
Cool phone.
Yeah, she's got
a really cool phone.
What? Is it a rash,
or is it the chicken pox?
I don't know! Google it.
Okay. All right, bye.
I got to go. Sadie might
have the chicken pox.
I had the chicken pox
three times.
I have no immunity to it.
BEN: We don't have the heart
to tell him it's herpes.
It's not herpes
if it's everywhere.
Are you coming?
You know, I'm all dressed,
so I'll just hang out.
Really?
Yeah, I'll take a cab home.
Okay. Be safe.
I will. Yeah.
Bye, lovely.
Bye.
All right, I'm gonna let you
two get to know each other.
Cheers.
Cheers.
To you.
No, no. You know, the, like,
Entertainment News channel?
E!
E!
Dude, I think he's doing
the dice thing too much.
That's really all he's got.
I love your curly hair!
It's so great.
Do you, like,
use a product or anything?
No, that's...
I use Jew, it's called.
You wanna get out of here?
Yeah, let's go.
You wanna come back
and hang out at my place?
Yes.
Yeah. Wicked.
I'll show you
my audition tape.
It's really funny.
Okay, I'm really
excited to watch that.
Let's go.
We could get a cab up,
this way. For sure.
This is a big yard.
Let's go swimming right now.
Let's just do that.
I know. It feels so right.
That's right.
Oh, man. Oh, man.
You're prettier than I am.
A lot.
Do you have a condom?
I do.
Okay.
In my pants. I have a condom.
Okay. Okay.
I'll get it.
Come on.
Hurry up.
Stupid fucker.
What are you doing?
I almost got it.
Just give me a second.
Oh, God, just do it already!
Okay.
Oh, great. Okay.
God.
Oh, that's great!
Good thing I'm drunk.
This is lasting forever.
Yeah, it's awesome.
I just doubled my record time.
Oh, yeah. You did.
I'm sorry,
I'm sweating on you.
Okay, just stop talking.
Fuck off, Martin.
I said, fuck off, Martin.
Hi.
Oh. Hey.
Hey.
I'm naked.
Yeah.
Did we have sex?
Yes.
Nice.
What time is it?
Why the fuck are we awake?
Let's go back to sleep.
I have to go to work.
Really?
Do you need to get
to work or anything?
No, I'm... No work today.
Do you wanna get breakfast?
Okay.
Morning.
Good morning, Allison.
I'm Ben.
What's happening, man?
Ben.
How's it going?
Ah, to be young.
Stop it.
You stop it.
Okay, see you later.
All righty.
See you later. Enjoy the day.
Never do what they did.
I'm gonna do it.
You are? Uh-oh. Someone's
getting home-schooled.
I just yacked something nasty.
I feel way better, though.
I think that's like
the secret. Like you gotta...
I mean, once you're hung-over,
you just gotta puke.
It feels so... Did you puke?
No.
You can. I won't think
it's gross or anything.
Oh, that's okay, I'm fine.
Okay.
I just need some coffee, so...
You know, the best thing
for a hangover is weed.
Do you smoke...
Do you smoke weed?
Not really.
You don't?
No.
At all?
Mmm-mmm.
Like in the morning?
No, I just don't.
You know, it's like...
It is like the best medicine.
Because it fixes everything.
Jonah broke his elbow once.
He just got high,
and it still clicks,
but, I mean, he's okay.
Right.
Yeah.
Last night was great,
what I remember of it.
Right, yeah.
Yeah, no, it was fun.
We had a great time.
Yeah.
So what do you do?
I work at E!
The television channel?
Uh-huh.
Remember?
Wow!
We had this
conversation last night.
I told you about my promotion.
I was out celebrating it.
No?
No.
I don't remember that at all.
Yeah. I'm super
excited about it.
I'm actually doing my first
on-air interview today, so...
With who?
Matthew Fox.
Matthew Fox from Lost?
Yeah.
You know what's interesting
about him?
What?
Nothing.
What?
Will you tell him
he's an asshole for me?
No.
Someone needs to.
Like who gives a shit?
Well, I hope a lot of people,
actually, because that's
what my job entails
is making sure people care
what he has to say.
I'm interviewing him.
Maybe it's just me. Maybe
I just don't give a shit.
I'm just saying
he deserves a beat-down.
Actually, it's sort
of embarrassing
to ask at this point,
but what do you do for work?
Me and my roommates
have started a... We're
starting an lnternet website.
Oh, cool. What is it?
I'll give you the virtual
experience, okay? How's that?
You're at your computer.
Mmm-hmm.
Who's an actress you like?
Mary Tyler Moore?
No.
That does not work at all.
No?
No.
Okay.
Let's say you love Meg Ryan.
I do.
Great. Who doesn't?
Yeah.
Let's say you like her so much
you wanna know every movie
where she shows her tits.
And not just that,
but how long into that
movie she shows her tits.
You come to our
web page exclusively.
Type in "Meg Ryan." Bam!
In the Cut, 38 minutes in,
like an hour and 10 minutes...
She's, like, naked
that whole fucking movie.
She does full frontal
in that movie.
Wow.
They should've called her
Harry, not Sally.
Really.
I'll show it to you.
I'll show you Meg Ryan's bush.
Okay.
Cool.
Yeah, I actually need
to get going, so...
Well, could...
Can I get your number?
I mean, I don't...
We had fun, right?
We should hook up again.
I'm gonna give you my card
'cause that'll be
the best way to...
Well, I mean, if you want
to contact me, I don't have
a cell, right now,
because of
payment complications.
But, I mean, you can e-mail me
at the web page. I check...
It's just Ben
at flesh-of-the-stars,
one word, dot-com.
Yeah.
Yeah. Okay.
Okay.
So, awesome.
All right, then.
Nice to meet you.
Yeah. Okay.
Bye. Take care.
See you.
Bye!
That was fucking brutal.
Yeah, that was brutal.
It was a huge mistake.
What's a mistake?
Nothing. Nothing that we need
to talk about right now.
Why did you do it?
Aunty Allison drank
too much chocolate milk.
And I was feeling weird
because of that.
And I made a...
I think that's enough.
Okay.
Did he wear a condom?
Yes.
Thank God.
Do you think
you'll do it again?
No, no way.
She was totally
repulsed by me.
What?
She just really
didn't seem to like me.
Like, she wasn't laughing at my jokes.
I mean, I'm like a funny guy.
Fucking funny as balls.
Hilarious, man.
I'm giving her the A shit.
Nothing. She thought our
web page was a bad idea.
What?
That fucking stuck-up bitch.
Yeah, I think so, too.
I think it's awesome
that you had sex with her.
If a goofy guy like you
had sex with her, I feel like
I had sex with her also.
I was so drunk.
I just wish I remembered it.
Hi, I'm Allison Scott.
And we're here today with
James Franco from Spider-Man.
How are you?
Great, great.
Thanks for coming.
Of course.
Tell me, were you
a big fan of the...
I'm sorry,
let me take that again.
Okay.
Tell me, were you a big fan
of the comic books growing up?
No, actually,
I didn't read any of
the comic books until
I got the movie and then...
Are you okay?
Mmm-hmm.
Yeah, just what about
the comic books?
Just keep talking.
Like I said,
I really wasn't into them,
but now that I did
the research, I think they're
pretty amazing, like...
Shit.
What the fuck?
Is that the sound
of you puking?
If this is one of those
fucking joke shows,
I'm not into it.
We should put this on YouTube.
Shut up.
This is hilarious.
You're an asshole.
Look how sweaty you are.
You look like Dom DeLuise.
I don't need to see it again.
It's gonna make me throw up.
You look like
Jabba the Hutt dying.
You're such an asshole.
I'm just jerking your chain.
I'll fix this. No problem.
Yeah, maybe if you can just
edit this out, and we can...
We can reshoot my questions.
What's up?
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
No, no, no. Over here.
Not on the mix board,
not on the mix board, here.
Are you okay?
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Are you sick?
I don't know.
What'd you eat?
I haven't eaten today yet.
You haven't...
Do you have, like,
a napkin or something?
Here, here.
What, do you have,
like, the flu?
I don't know.
God, I hope
you're not pregnant.
It's impossible. You have
to have sex to get pregnant.
B.K. It's Brent Master Five.
Allison just puked.
Dude, that's what I said.
She's probably
pregnant, right?
Oh, shit.
How does she look right now?
She looks like
she just realized
that she's pregnant.
No, I can't be
pregnant. Right?
I mean that was, what?
Eight weeks ago?
When was that?
Mmm-hmm.
Did you miss your period?
No. Wait.
I don't know.
Shit. I don't know.
I can't remember.
I was... I mean, I've been
really stressed at work.
I can't remember
my last period.
Are you the lady who doesn't
realize she's pregnant
till she's sitting
on the toilet
and a kid pops out?
Can you not joke right now?
Don't joke right now.
This is really serious.
Did I meet him?
Yeah. You know, he was
kind of like medium height,
sort of chubby.
Blonde, curly hair. Remember?
With the man-boobs.
Yes.
Here, I have this thing
of him on my phone.
I just watched it.
Hey! I live in your phone!
Oh.
This is the best
night of my life.
I gotta pee.
Yeah.
Oh, God.
How did this happen?
Oh, shit.
Well, there's only
one way to find out.
They're here!
Here they are! Over here!
Oh, no.
Okay, here we are.
Okay.
Okay. All right.
Here.
Oh, no. Give me more!
Give me a few more!
Did you try the Ova-Sure?
I'm dripping,
I'm dripping. Wait.
Oh, good! A smiley face!
Oh, I think that's bad.
How long does this one take?
These can't all be positive.
Let me try one.
God, you really had to pee.
What is this?
What the hell is this?
I think you picked up
the wrong one.
Oh, fuck.
That scared me.
That would suck. I'm sorry.
That scared me.
It's gonna be fine. Right?
Right?
Of course it will be fine.
It's gonna be fine.
You just need to call him.
Maybe I don't need to call him
until after I see the doctor.
You need to call.
I don't want to call him.
I don't need to call him.
You should call.
I can't call him anyway.
He doesn't even have a phone.
He didn't even have
a number to give me.
He doesn't have a phone?
Said he had some
kind of billing issue.
He can't afford a phone?
Sadie has a phone.
Oh, shit, you're right.
I got to call.
I don't know. I'm gonna
have to look him up
on his stupid website.
What kind of website
does he have?
DEBBlE: He spelled "coming"
wrong. Oh, it's cum...
Yeah.
Oh, that's gross.
Just go to "Contact Us."
Ben?
Yeah.
"What is your number?
I need to speak
with you right away."
Send?
Yep.
You're sure?
Yeah.
I love weed.
JONAH: I could smoke weed
every second of every day.
Jay, I am your stoner.
Hey, Benjamin?
Yeah.
Flesh of the Stars
just got an e-mail.
Really?
Would you like me
to read it to you?
Yeah, sure.
"Ben, what is your number?
"l need to speak to you
right away. Allison Scott."
ALL: Oh! Shit!
Someone wants seconds, mama!
Oh, man!
"Looking forward
to speaking with you."
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Do one of those
smiley faces at the end.
Fucking-A. Those are sexy.
Sent.
Somebody wants another piece!
Booty-booty call.
Yeah, hello?
Hi.
Hey, Ben, this is...
This is Allison. I don't know
if you remember me.
Oh, yeah, Allison. What's up?
She like the way
your dick tastes.
Yeah, I actually was
just wondering if maybe you
wanted to get together,
like tomorrow night?
I've been meaning
to call you so we could,
like, hook up again.
You know what I'm saying?
Okay, cool.
Let's meet up maybe
tomorrow night? You wanna
just grab some dinner?
Yeah. Why not?
Meeting of minds sounds good.
What do you say Geisha House,
Hollywood, 9..00?
Sure, sure. That's cool.
Can we make it
more like 6:00, though?
I'd like to keep it early.
BEN: 6:00. Beat the rush.
Yeah, leaves
more time for afterwards.
Dessert. Sweet.
Okay, great.
So, yeah. I'll just meet
you there, then, at 6:00.
Yeah.
I'll see you there.
Okay, take care. Peace.
Oh, shit.
I'm gonna get laid,
motherfucker!
Yes! Yes!
BEN: Nice place, huh?
ALLlSON: Yeah,
it's really nice.
Sorry it took so long to
get a table. I didn't realize
you needed a reservation.
Oh, no, that's okay.
So how's work?
Great.
How's E!?
Great.
That's awesome.
Do you know Vince Vaughn?
Have you ever met him?
No.
I really feel like
we'd get along well. I just...
He seems like a fun guy.
I feel like we'd, like,
hang together well.
Mmm-hmm.
I feel like he'd like me.
I'm sure a lot of guys
are like, "Oh, I'd like
to hang out with that celeb",
but I really think he would
want to hang out with me,
is like the cool thing.
I'm sure he would. Yeah.
You look very pretty, though.
Thanks.
By the way.
Yeah, I just thought...
I don't know, I thought
maybe it'd be cool
to hang out
a little bit and...
We didn't really get
to talk that much
last time, so I thought...
That we didn't.
I thought maybe we'd
just talk and get to know
each other better.
Cool. Okay.
I'll start. I'm Canadian.
Oh, that's cool.
From Vancouver. I live
here illegally, actually.
Don't tell anyone.
But it works out
in my advantage,
I think, ultimately,
'cause I don't have
to pay any taxes.
So financially that's helpful
'cause I don't have
a lot of money.
You know, I mean,
I'm not poor or anything,
but I eat a lot of spaghetti.
So, you know, the web page
or whatever is just something
that you guys do for fun?
Do you have a real job?
Well, that is our job.
Oh.
We don't technically get money
for the hours we put in,
but it is our job.
So, how do you... Right.
How do I pay rent and shit?
When I was in high school,
I got ran over
by a postal truck.
Oh, my God.
It just kind of...
It was my foot
more than anything.
But I got like 14 grand from
the British Columbia government.
Right.
And that really lasted me.
I mean, until now.
It's been almost 10 years.
I have like 900 bucks left.
So that should last me for,
like, I mean, I'm not
a mathematician,
but like another
two years or some shit.
I think.
Yeah.
So I have something
I really need to tell you.
It's kind of why I called you.
Here goes. Um...
I'm pregnant.
Fuck off.
What?
What?
I'm pregnant.
With emotion?
With a baby.
You're the father.
I'm the father?
Yes.
How the fuck
could this happen?
I don't know.
I don't know. I mean,
I thought you were
wearing a condom.
No.
What?
I wasn't.
Why not?
Because you told me not to.
What are you talking about?
What am I talking about?
You told me not to.
I did not tell you
not to wear a condom.
Here's what happened, okay?
I will give you a play-by-play
of my memory.
I almost had
the condom on my dick.
It was on the cusp,
and then you said,
"Just do it, already."
I didn't mean do it
without a condom.
I meant "do it"
like "hurry up,"
Iike "Get fucking going!"
Well, I assumed
you were wearing a patch,
or like a dental dam
or one of those
fucking butterfly clips
or something like that.
What the hell is a dental dam?
It's like Saran Wrap!
It's disgusting, okay?
But I thought you had one.
Why the fuck didn't you
stop me once we started?
I don't know! I couldn't tell
that you didn't have one on!
Obviously, I was drunk!
Was your vagina drunk?
Did you think
it's the thinnest condom
on earth I have on?
I'm a fucking inventor?
I made a dick-skin condom?
He hollowed out
a penis and put it on?
What the fuck?
You are unbelievable.
Okay, you know what? Maybe
I've reacted unfavorably.
So what happens now?
I don't know how this works.
I am going to
the doctor next week,
and I thought you could
come with me
to the gynecologist.
So you haven't seen him,
though?
No.
So you don't know
if you're pregnant.
Well, I'm not 100% sure.
You're not 100% sure.
I bet you're not pregnant.
No, they're not.
No, they're all in the bag.
They're in the bag.
Allison Scott?
Yeah. Come on.
I'm supposed to come?
Yes.
Hello. My name is
Thomas Pellagrino.
I'm... I'm Ben Stone.
Hi, there, champ.
Nice to meet you.
And you must be
Debbie's sister.
Yeah.
Alice.
Allison. Hi.
Hi. How are you?
Good.
So, what can
I help you with today,
Mr. and Mrs. Stone?
I took a home pregnancy test,
and it said I was pregnant,
so here we are.
Okay. Let's have a look.
Legs up.
Nice office.
Thank you.
Well, you do look
a lot like your sister.
This is gonna be cold.
And you're next.
Okay, there is
the cervix and the uterus.
See that?
That dark sac there,
that's the amniotic sac.
And right there
in the middle is the embryo.
Do you see that flicker?
You know what that is?
Yeah, that's a heartbeat.
Yeah, it looks like
you are pregnant.
About eight or nine weeks,
I'd say.
Congratulations.
That... That's it?
Yep.
Take good care of it.
Now the fun part starts.
Let me... Let me make
a picture for you, huh?
That'll be fun.
Okay. Well, I'll...
I'll meet you in my office.
Okay.
I'll give you
a little time alone, there.
Oh, God.
Oh, no.
It's okay.
I can't fucking believe
you didn't wear a bag!
Who does that?
Why did we go to Costco
and buy a year's supply
of condoms
if you weren't gonna
use them, man?
I can't believe you did this.
You fucked everything up.
JASON: Look, the real point
is not to get yourself
in this position.
That's what
you have to realize.
You gotta know
all the tricks.
Like, for example,
if a woman's on top,
she can't get pregnant.
It's just gravity.
Well, that's true.
Everyone knows that.
What goes up must come down.
I think it's awesome that
you're gonna have a kid, man.
Think about it like this.
It's just an excuse to play
with all your old toys again.
You know what
I think you should do?
Take care of it.
Tell me you don't want him
to get an "A" word.
Yes, I do, and I won't say it
for little Baby Ears
over there,
but it rhymes
with "Shma-shmortion."
I'm just saying...
Hold on, Jay, cover your ears.
You should get
a shma-shmortion
at the shma-shmortion clinic.
Ben, you cannot let
these monsters have
any part of your child's life.
All right? I'm gonna be
there to rear your child.
You hear that, Ben?
Don't let him near the kid.
He wants
to rear your child!
I just have a quick question.
Do you use that Canadian
flag tattoo as a cum target
of some sort?
How many points do you get if you hit
the leaf? Like a million?
Jonah, I am a patriot.
This is a tribute to my
country and my countrymen.
I always aim right.
Right into a dude's ass.
Please, guys.
Ben, come on, man.
I'm just kidding you.
Oh, great. Now he's upset.
I won't let him do it.
Allison, just take care of it.
Take care of it. Move on.
What's gonna happen
with your career?
How are you gonna tell them?
I'm not gonna tell them
for a while.
I have a while
before I have to say anything.
How could you not tell them?
They're not gonna know.
I mean, I'm only gonna start
to show when I'm like,
I don't know,
six months or something.
Seven months.
Three months.
No.
Three months. Fat in the face,
jowls, fat ass.
Debbie didn't get fat.
Debbie is a freak of nature.
Mom, you know,
it's important to me
that you be supportive.
I cannot be supportive
of this. This is a mistake.
This is a big, big mistake.
Now, think about
your stepsister.
Now, you remember
what happened with her?
She had the same
situation as you,
and she had it taken care of.
And you know what?
Now she has a real baby.
Honey, this is not the time.
I'm gonna be a grandfather.
You happy about that?
Absolutely. Delighted.
This is a disaster.
No, this is not a disaster.
It is...
An earthquake is a disaster.
Your grandmother
having Alzheimer's so bad
she doesn't even know
who the fuck I am,
that's a disaster.
This is a good thing.
This is a blessing.
I have a vision
for how my life would go,
and this definitely is not it.
Wait. Is this your vision?
Are you living
your vision right now?
I am kind of living
my vision, yeah.
Well, that is sad,
I'm telling you.
Life doesn't care
about your vision. Okay?
Stuff happens.
You just got to deal with it.
You roll with it.
That's the beauty of it all.
I just don't get how I tell
the kid not to do drugs
when I do drugs.
I'll feel like a hypocrite.
Well, remember what I told you
when you were a teenager?
What did you say?
I said,
"No pills, no powders."
That's right, that's right.
Right. If it grows
in the ground,
it's probably okay.
I mean, I guess it worked.
Like you told me not
to smoke pot all those years,
and then I found out
you were smoking pot
that whole time.
Not the whole time.
Just in the evenings
and all day every weekend.
Not that much.
Honestly, though,
when you look at me
do you not think at all, like,
"You know,
if he just never existed,
"l would have avoided
a massive heap of trouble,"
you know?
Absolutely not.
I love you totally
and completely.
You're the best thing
that ever happened to me.
I'm the best thing
that ever happened to you?
Yeah.
Now I just feel bad for you.
BEN: Hello?
Hi. Ben?
Oh. Hey, Allison.
How's it going?
Good, good.
You know,
I was just calling to...
To let you know that I've
decided to keep the baby.
I'm keeping it.
Oh.
Yeah. So, that's
what's happening with that.
Good. That's good. That's what
I was hoping you'd do.
So, awesome.
Yeah. Yeah, it is good.
Okay, I know
we didn't plan this,
and, you know,
neither of us really thought
it was gonna happen,
but life is like that,
you know,
you can't plan for it.
And even if we did plan,
Iife doesn't care about
your plans, necessarily.
And you just kind of have
to go with the flow and,
you know,
I know my job is to just
support you in whatever
it is you wanna do,
and, I'm in, you know.
So whatever you wanna do,
I'm gonna do,
you know. It's...
I'm on board. Yay!
I really appreciate
you saying that.
No problem.
You know, so I'll tell you,
you know, maybe if you could
help me by telling me, like,
one thing that I am
supposed to do,
then that would be good,
because I literally have
no idea whatsoever.
I have no idea, either.
So, do you want to, like,
get together and talk about it
or something like that?
Yeah, sure.
Like a date? I mean...
Yeah.
Hey.
Hi.
You look beautiful.
Thank you.
No problem. Come on in.
BEN: Everyone,
this is Allison.
Hi.
Ally. Hey. Jason,
I'm sure you remember.
Yes.
You look beautiful.
Thank you.
Your body's responding
really well to the pregnancy.
Thank you.
It's amazing
how fast the milk arrives.
Oh.
How's your sis?
She's good.
Oh, good. Tell her,
"What's up?" for me.
Okay.
All right, I'm gonna go make
a protein shake.
And this beautiful
young man is Jonah.
ALLlSON: Hi.
Hey.
Okay, that's Martin
and Jodi over there.
ALLlSON: Hi.
I'm gonna grab my shirt.
Just take a seat if you want.
Okay.
Cool.
WOMAN ON TV:
You are scared, aren't you?
Just another day
at the office.
Uh-huh.
JONAH: Do you have
any acting experience?
No. Uh-huh.
How's it going?
You wanna toke?
No. I'm good.
Hi.
ALLlSON: Hi.
I'm Jodi.
Yeah, hi.
I heard you were pregnant.
Mmm-hmm.
Oh, aren't you scared?
The way it's gonna
come out of your...
It's gonna hurt a lot, I bet.
Your vagina...
That's so sick.
I don't know.
Are you hungry?
No, I'm okay right now.
Thank you.
You must be angry
at the baby whenever
it steals your food, huh?
"Oh, it's mine, not yours."
But, you know,
because you're family,
you got to share.
Right.
Man, my balls are shaved.
My pubes are trimmed.
I'm ready to fucking
rock this shit.
JONAH: What the fuck, man?
If I go in there and see
fucking pubes sprinkled
on the toilet seat,
I'm gonna fucking
lose my mind!
Last time I went
to the bathroom, Jay,
I took a shit and my shit looked
like a fucking stuffed animal!
You're embarrassing me
in company.
You embarrass yourself.
Oh, great. I hope you have
a great evening!
All right. Let's go.
Okay.
BEN: See you guys later.
The funny thing is I really
had never even thought
about having a baby.
Yeah.
I mean, if this
hadn't happened,
I don't think I would have
wanted to have a baby for like,
I don't know,
at least 10 years.
At least!
God, I mean, honestly,
I just got used to the, like,
notion that someone would even
have sex with me.
I didn't think
this would happen.
Get ready.
This will be coming out of you
in seven months.
This is exactly what
our baby will look like.
It's a beautiful picture, Ben.
It is. It's not bad.
Hello, Mommy.
Our baby's gonna be
French-Canadian.
With a little hint
of Spanish.
Exactly. I'm not good
with accents, but...
BEN: Baby books.
ALLlSON: Awesome.
"What to Expect
When You're Expecting. "
What can we expect?
Well, you can't eat sushi.
You can't smoke.
You can't smoke marijuana.
You can't smoke crack.
You can't jump on trampolines.
This is basically a giant list
of things you can't do.
Yeah, it sounds thrilling.
I'm gonna be sitting there
on the trampoline
smoking crack.
And you're not gonna have
anything to do.
You're gonna be bored.
But I can't wait
to read these, honestly.
Seriously, I put these
in front of my toilet, though,
they'll be read
by tomorrow morning.
Do you want me
to get you that?
Yeah.
You like it?
Yeah, thank you.
No problem.
These are heavy.
So what do you think?
Should we have sex tonight?
Sounds awful.
I'm just really constipated.
Do you really want to?
Well, now...
Shut up.
It's pretty crazy,
your sister's pregnant.
We have to help her.
I think they'll be fine.
Look at us. It happened to us.
We'll help her raise the baby.
Well...
Fuck!
At least we don't have
to use a condom, you know?
But we can. I don't...
I brought some
just in case. I don't...
I don't have VD or anything.
I mean, I don't, I thought...
It's not that.
You know, it's just...
I thought maybe we could get
a little fun out of
your situation, you know?
Okay, first of all,
it's not my situation.
It's our situation.
I know, of course,
I know that.
And just because I'm pregnant,
I'm not some ruined woman
and all romance
goes out the door.
Okay, okay. I'm sorry.
It's just...
I like you a lot.
That's all this is. That's...
I like you, too.
Sweet.
A little, so far.
I mean, we have seven months
before the baby comes.
We don't have to rush it.
Yeah.
We should really just try
to get to know each other
and give this a real shot.
You know, we got ourselves
into this situation.
We kind of have to.
For the baby, right?
Exactly.
Okay, if this was our second
date, what would you do?
B.J., if I'm just being
honest, I would probably...
I told my roommates
I thought I was gonna
get a B.J., so...
You know what?
For the sake of getting
to know one another,
can you not talk like that?
Yeah, I can do that.
I'm... I'm really nervous.
I'm nervous, too.
I'm really nervous.
Yeah.
You're a sweet guy, right?
I think I am. Yeah.
Don't fuck me over, okay?
I wouldn't do that.
Just so you know,
I'm the guy girls fuck over.
I'm that guy.
So you don't fuck me over.
Okay?
Okay.
I couldn't take it.
I can't raise this baby alone.
Who's he?
I'm Ben Stone.
He's my boyfriend.
That's nice.
I've never met him before.
Well, he's a new boyfriend.
But a boyfriend.
So he came over
for breakfast because
he's your new boyfriend?
DEBBlE: Yeah.
He came from his house.
Drove over to our house
because he thought
it would be fun
to have breakfast with us,
so he drove his car
from his house to our house
to have breakfast.
Because he likes
breakfast so much.
I love breakfast.
You guys wanna hear something neat?
We're gonna have a baby together.
SADlE: What?
Yeah, a baby.
Well, you're not married.
Aren't you supposed
to be married to have a baby?
You don't have to be.
But they should be
because they love each other,
and people who love each other
get married and have babies.
Mmm-mmm.
Do you love each other?
Yes, they love each other.
Because that's what you do.
When you love each other,
you get married
and have a baby.
Where do babies come from?
DEBBlE: Where do you think
they come from?
Well, I think a stork,
he drops it down,
and then a hole goes
in your body,
and there's blood everywhere,
coming out of your head,
and then you push
your belly button,
and then your butt falls off,
and then you hold your butt
and you have to dig,
and you'll find a little baby.
That's exactly right.
Feed the teddy bear.
Okay, I feed
your bear the grass?
Okay.
You know what your bear
would also like
to do with some grass?
Smoke it.
What do you think of him?
He's funny, right?
Mmm-hmm.
Fetch.
All right, bring it back.
He's playing fetch
with my kids.
He's treating my kids
like they're dogs.
No, he's not.
Go get it! Fetch!
DEBBlE: Who plays fetch
with kids?
ALLlSON: He's trying.
He's making an effort.
BEN: Bring it back.
He's overweight.
Where does that end?
How old is he?
Looks 33.
He can barely get in and out
of that little house.
Imagine how much bigger
he's gonna get.
That means he has bad genes.
Your kid is gonna
be overweight.
Shit.
I'm gonna get you!
I'm gonna get...
Just give him a break.
Okay. I'll try.
They seem to love bubbles.
Oh, God. They go
ape shit over bubbles.
They're really going ape shit.
I mean, that's an incredible
thing about a child.
I mean, what's so great
about bubbles?
They float. You can pop them.
I mean, I get it. I get it.
I wish I liked anything as much
as my kids like bubbles.
That's sad.
It's totally sad.
Their smiling faces just
point out your inability
to enjoy anything.
Am I gonna be okay, man?
Oh, who knows?
Is anybody okay? I'm not okay.
You're asking the wrong guy.
Just don't ask me to lend you
any money, you know?
Can I just have some?
No.
I have 15 years
of tennis lessons.
And 12 years
of sucking dick lessons.
So?
I can't ref the next games,
by the way.
I got to go meet
gynecologists with Allison.
She doesn't like
her gynecologist.
JAY: You think she likes you?
She's trying to.
She's entertaining
the idea of liking you.
Exactly. I'll take that.
Yeah, well, see,
she's bringing you
to the gynaechiatrist.
She must like you.
Yeah. Pretty good, I think.
You know who
I'd like to get pregnant,
is that Felicity Huffman, man.
Ever since Transamerica, I can't
get her out of my mind.
Okay, guys. I hate to
crack the whip,
but it's kind of
business meeting time.
I need moolah.
When do you think
we can launch this site?
Jeez.
Look, man. You can't rush this.
You know what happens
to these sites when they go up
and they don't function well?
They die.
Seriously, guys, let's say
I want to launch today.
Let's start. Let's use that
as a jumping off point.
Let's make this happen.
What can we do?
Look, man, I didn't go
to Yale so I could work
I thought you went
to Santa Monica City College.
I went where I went, Jason.
BEN: I'm not asking you
to work 12 hours a day.
I mean, you guys watch movies
without nudity in them.
I'll tell you what, man.
We could probably
get it online in three months.
Thank you. Yes! Three months.
JONAH: Come on, Jason!
Fuck off!
Yeah, well, you still have
a little dick, Cartman.
Do you have mints?
Yeah, right there.
I see what you're saying.
Totally.
I don't get how
you're comfortable
with any of these guys
when they're doing
what they're doing to you.
First guy...
Oh, there that shit is.
I've been looking for that.
The first guy,
when he put his finger in,
he gave me this look like,
"Sorry, man, it's the job"
and I'm like, "Don't look
at me when your finger's..."
I mean, get in and get out.
Get on with your day,
you know?
That's the closest
I'll ever come to being
in a threesome, I think.
Really?
If you had to do a threesome
with me and one
of my other roommates,
who would it be?
Um...
I'm gonna have to go with Jay.
Oh, no.
Yeah.
Jay?
I'm really turned on by his
sort of skinny awkwardness
and his hot little Mohawk.
His Mohawk.
You two are never allowed to be in
the same room ever again.
If we ever had a three-way
with Jay, you turn around,
he'd be sucking my dick.
I'm telling you right now.
Do you smoke cigarettes?
No.
Do you smoke cigarettes?
I have on occasion.
On occasion? When? When was
the last time you had one cig?
You know, one, you know, little...
I need to know,
or I will not be your doctor.
How you doing?
I'm breathing like James
Gandolfini over here.
Slow down, man.
You're making me look
like a jackass.
How long you kids
been married?
We're not.
No.
You're single?
She's not single.
She's just not married.
Are you two together?
Hey, you wanna
trade boyfriends?
Just kidding. Kind of.
That is not your vagina.
That's your asshole.
That happens
about five times a day.
Are you sure you don't
wanna come paintballing?
Have fun, guys. Seriously.
Watch the eyes.
See you, guys.
JASON: See you, Ally. Bye.
I don't wanna go.
I swear to God.
I wanna see Breathless
at the LACMA.
Boobs! Boobs, boobs, boobs!
Hold on, pause it,
pause it, pause it.
Boobs and bush!
Boobs and bush.
Good boobs.
Those are good ones!
We're like
Right in
the beginning credits.
Credit bush.
You never get
opening credit bush.
I know. That's so crazy.
No.
You got me.
You got me.
How many doctors are there
in your practice?
Just 'cause I'm sort of
looking for a more
personal experience.
I wanna make sure
that you're my doctor
on the day, and...
Yeah, I understand.
We have three other doctors
in the practice,
but I'm your man, okay?
I don't take vacations.
I hate Hawaii.
I went to the Caribbean
when I was 14,
and I'm never going back.
I feel really good about this.
I think we found our doctor.
Really?
Yeah.
All right.
Are you serious right now?
Yeah.
Wow.
You look relieved.
I am very relieved.
I can't imagine meeting
any more of you people.
You're being dramatic.
We didn't meet that many.
Do they know?
Pardon?
The belly.
Oh, yeah. The donuts,
they call to me.
Hey, Allison. Great job.
Thanks.
You're pregnant, aren't you?
What?
I mean, you've put on like,
eight pounds, nine.
It's all in your uterus.
Oh, shit.
I haven't told them.
Do you think
they're gonna be mad?
I'm, like, really
chickening out about this.
It's okay. We can hide this.
We'll dress you in black,
and we'll emphasize
your boobs.
Awesome.
I mean, your boobs
are gonna be big.
And then they're
gonna be, like, scary big.
But then they'll go down.
And then they'll stay down.
Just... Just don't
say anything, okay?
Please don't say anything.
Oh, no, I won't, I won't.
Just tell them. They'll be cool.
Everybody loves
somebody pregnant.
Did you see
this sex offender website?
These are all the sex
offenders in our neighborhood.
Looks like your computer
has chicken pox.
Those are sex offenders.
These people live
in our neighborhood.
Well, I'll skip their houses
when we're trick-or-treating.
What do you want me to do?
Form a posse?
Got your six-shooter on you?
I got my lynching rope.
You shouldn't take it
so lightly.
I don't take it lightly.
You know, I'm not gonna
go over to any of these
people's houses and say,
"Hey, do you mind...
Can you baby-sit?"
If I didn't care about
these things,
you wouldn't
care about anything.
Care more.
You're so concerned
with stuff, like
"Don't get them vaccinated.
"Don't let them eat fish.
There's mercury in the water."
Jesus, how much
Dateline NBC can you watch?
I know we're supposed
to be nice
with each other right now,
but I'm having
a really hard time.
I'm struggling
with it right now.
What am I doing?
'Cause I want to rip your
fucking head off because
you're so fucking stupid!
This is scary.
These are our children.
Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.
You fucking dipshit.
God! You...
Mmm-hmm.
I literally am at a point where
I don't know what I can say.
So I'm the bad guy
because I'm trying to protect
our kids from child molesters
and mercury?
And you're cool
'cause you don't give a shit.
Yeah.
Yeah? Is that it?
Pretty much.
God, you're an asshole.
Don't do this in front of Ben.
I don't give a shit about Ben.
Sorry, Ben.
It's okay. I didn't think
she did, anyway.
Okay, come on! Let's go.
Oh, I can't go.
This band is doing a showcase
out in the Valley. I got to go.
It's Saturday.
I got to go.
DEBBlE: You don't want to know
the sex of the baby?
That's no fun.
Ben knows, but I've
sworn him to secrecy.
I'll get it out of him.
No.
Hey.
Think we'll ever be as happy
as Baby Björn couple is?
We are that happy.
Yeah. You look happy.
Which is awesome,
'cause I never like
guys like you. It's great.
You keep saying that. I know.
This is it. This is perfect.
Nice.
Holy shit! It's 1,400 bucks.
We can just borrow yours.
Is that okay?
No. You need your own crib.
You know, there's one
of these lying in an alley
behind my house.
We could just grab that.
Just rub Purell all over it.
You know what? Let me buy it.
I need to get you
a baby present anyway.
And I would love
to get it for you.
ALLlSON: No.
I'm serious. I want to.
No. It's too much.
Yes. We'll take it.
Obviously, I mean,
don't insult the woman.
She wants to get us a gift.
Right.
Wanna buy me some new shoes?
What else can l
squeeze out of you?
Xbox 360. Xbox 360.
So hot in the Valley.
ASHLEY: Hey! Oh, Allison!
GlRL: Hi.
How are you?
It's so good to see you.
We've been watching you on E!
It's the coolest thing.
Yeah, it's been super
exciting, just crazy busy.
I'm so sorry I haven't called.
GlRL: Oh, it's fine.
Hi, I'm Ashley.
This is my friend, Ben.
I'm Ben.
I went to school with Allison.
Okay, so, is Debbie
having another baby?
No. Allison is.
What? I just saw you
a couple months ago.
You're pregnant?
It was a big surprise.
It's actually... It's a really
funny story, actually.
If you guys... If you got
a second to hear it.
It's not really funny.
It's not funny.
Let them be the judge, okay?
I think it's funny.
You know they say
don't drink and drive?
Uh-huh.
BEN: Don't drink and bone!
GlRL: Wow.
Okay.
Yeah, I mean,
she was acting weird,
and I really think
it's just 'cause, like,
you know, I haven't made
an honest woman out of her.
She's carrying my bastard child.
No one wants that.
That's what I did.
I mean, I married Debbie
when she got pregnant.
You think she's, like,
hiding me?
Like, she's, like, embarrassed
by me or something like that?
Probably. I'd hide you.
How much do wedding rings cost?
I mean, it really depends,
you know?
I think you're supposed to spend,
like, three months' pay on a ring.
That'll be easy.
I don't make any money.
Really? I thought there was
lot of money in porn.
God, it's not porn, okay?
All we do is we show you
what nude scenes
are in what movies.
Oh, like Mr. Skin?
Who's Mr. Skin?
Dude, Mr. Skin.
Mr. Skin?
JONAH: No!
JONAH: We've wasted
This is exactly
the same as our site.
How the fuck did this happen?
Mr. Skin. That's even
a better name than ours!
Fuck me in the beard.
Dude, they got the top 10
group shower scenes!
Why didn't you think
of that, Jay?
Don't put this on me!
God damn it!
Well, shit, I saw it online
at one point, but I guess
I didn't connect the dots.
What are we gonna do now?
All we need to do is think
of a new, better idea
that no one else
has thought of already.
Oh, dude, Spider-Man 3
starts in eight minutes.
JONAH: Don't worry, man.
We'll figure it out.
You know what?
I think just because
this site exists
doesn't mean our site
won't work, necessarily.
Good things come
in pairs, man, you know.
Oh, for sure.
Volcano, Dante's Peak,
Deep Impact, Armageddon, right?
Wyatt Earp, Tombstone.
Panda Express,
Yoshinoya Beef Bowl.
Exactly. We can work together.
This can help us,
if anything, I think.
We're fine. We're golden.
Look, Allison, I'm sure
this isn't how you pictured
it being, exactly,
and it's not
how I wanted it to be,
but that is why I'm presenting
you this empty box.
It's a promise, Allison.
It's a promise
that one day I will...
I will fill this box
with a ring that you deserve,
a beautiful ring.
And I can't afford it yet.
I've picked it out already,
though, and it's at De Beers,
and it's really nice.
So basically I'm asking you,
will you marry me?
Because I'm in love with you.
I love you, too.
Really?
Oh, man,
that's so nice to hear.
That's the first time a girl's
ever said that to me, so...
But here's the thing.
There's a thing?
I don't really know yet what
that love means, you know.
Just 'cause it's so new,
and it's so exciting
that it's great.
I don't know. We've only
known each other
Okay.
Honestly, I mean, I thought...
I thought you felt weird
that we're having a baby
and we're not
engaged or anything.
I'm gonna get off my knee.
Yeah.
It's hurting a little bit.
No, I'm okay with that.
You know, we're just doing
what we can.
We're making the best of it,
and I don't want us
to put any more pressure
on ourselves
than we already have.
Okay. Yeah.
That makes perfect sense.
Are you okay? I don't want
to hurt your feelings.
No, no, no.
Honestly, I just wanted
to do right by you, you know?
So if you don't want to,
that's totally cool, you know?
Okay.
I really do love you.
I know. Thanks.
You mentioned that. It's nice.
