Well, he walked up to me
and he asked me if I wanted to dance
He looked kind of nice
and so I said I might take a chance
When he danced he held me tight
And when he walked me home
that night
All the stars were shining bright
And then he kissed me
Each time I saw him
I couldn't wait to see him again
I wanted to let him know
that he was more than a friend
I didn't know just what to do
So I whispered I love you
And he said that he loved me too
And then he kissed me
He kissed me in a way
that I've never been kissed before
He kissed me in a way
that I want to be kissed for evermore
I knew that he was mine
so I gave him all the love that I had
And one day he took me home
to meet his mom and his dad
Then he asked me to be his bride
And always be right by his side
I felt so happy I almost cried
And then he kissed me
And then he kissed me
And then he kissed me
-
- Oh, God. He's here.
OK Chris, just relax.
Tonight is going to be the greatest
night of your life.
Hi.
Hi, Chris.
- l'm a little bit overdressed.
- No, it's just...
l got to cancel.
My little sister got sick and my
parents are going out tonight.
Well, l could come over and help out.
We could make some chicken soup
or something.
No, you don't want to be there.
She's contagious.
l don't want you to get sick.
We'll do the French restaurant thing
next week, OK?
OK.
When?
l don't know. Friday, Saturday.
l got to get going.
My sister's waiting for me.
You're upset about tonight,
aren't you?
No.
Well, yeah, a little.
But l understand.
You know, Chris...
Girls like you come along
once in a lifetime.
Whoa!
Contagious.
- Contagious?
- Yeah, that's what he said.
He's lying.
Brenda...!
l don't know why you're making
such a big deal about him.
He's the best thing that's ever
happened to me.
He's the only thing that's ever
happened to you.
That's why we've got to get out.
lt's like a Dairy Queen.
You only get one flavour.
You know, l asked you over here
to cheer me up.
- l feel worse.
- Oh, Chris, l'm sorry.
l'm just in a really bad mood.
My parents are driving me crazy.
My stepmom is such a pain.
lf l don't get out of the house l'm
going to spike her Tab with Drano.
Don't do that.
Chris?
- Hi, Brenda.
- Hi.
Hi, Mom.
That was Mrs Anderson.
She wants to know if you can babysit
for her tonight.
- No. Tell her l can't.
- Why not?
- Wait, aren't we doing something?
- l have to go home.
Because l want to stay home
and be depressed.
Sit for the Andersons.
That'll depress anyone.
l'm too old to babysit.
Sometimes you know
what you're looking for
Sometimes you don't make it
out the door
This time I know what I'm doing
I'm not fooling
cos I just can't stop
Trying to get a hold on you
Guess what, Brad?
Mom is going to kill you for wearing
skates indoors.
Mom's got to catch me first.
Guess what?
l don't care, winghead.
Mom got Chris to babysit for me.
Chris?
Oh, my...
- Sara!
- Bye!
The night was long
and the road was rough
Chris is coming!
Would you get out of the way?
Chris is coming.
Now that I've found you
I'll hold on tight
Never gonna let you
out of my sight
Oh, no.
Hi, Chris. Come on in.
Thanks a million for this.
l'm sorry about the short notice.
No problem.
l'm glad l could help.
Sara.
- Did you take my Clearasil again?
- l ran out of brown.
Great. How am l supposed
to cover up my zits?
- You want some orange?
- l can't use paint.
What do you think?
l figure it's my best yet.
l got the sun rays and the cape
and the special helmet...
Great! You wasted all my Clearasil
on another picture of Thor?
Thor's my hero.
- Thor's a homo.
- ls not.
- Yeah, he is.
- ls not.
- Thor's a complete homo.
- Take it back, Brad.
Take back what you said about Thor.
Take it back, Brad.
Take back what you said about Thor.
You are going to kill somebody
with these things.
Take back what you said about Thor!
No.
lf you don't take it back,
l'll tell Chris about all those love
poems you write about her.
All right, Sara. l'm sorry.
- Thor's not a homo.
- Thank you.
- Hi, Chris.
- Hi.
Hi.
Hi.
- You didn't just hear what my...
- No.
Cool.
Boy, you look great. l mean, really.
Your hair. Your eyes.
What about them?
They're so well placed.
- Brad, relax.
- Relax.
Take your coat?
Sorry. l'm sorry.
- l didn't...
- Thank you.
Boy, this is a really cool coat.
No way is this from Sears.
This is way too cool.
- lt was my grandpa's.
- He's got great taste.
He's dead.
Brad, stop fawning all over Chris.
Come on in the kitchen, honey.
- Yeah, she did.
- We played bridge the other night.
- Hi.
- Hiya, Chris.
- Brad did it.
- Clean it up.
Sure, mom.
All right, Chris.
l left some notes for you.
We're going to be at a reception
at the Associates Centre. Here.
Sara is not to wear her skates
in the house.
Now, Sara, Chris is in charge, OK?
Sure.
Can we go to Häagen-Dazs?
Well, yes.
But don't go too late, all right?
Brad will stay at his friend Daryl's
tonight, so don't worry about him.
This one is just getting over
a very bad cough...
lt's been almost two weeks.
..so l want her to take some of this.
Give her a spoonful in about an hour
and another before she goes to bed.
Will you stop eating chocolate?
You're going to have zits
all over your face.
Mom...!
Jesus!
- You guys have a good time.
- We should be home by one.
- OK.
- Take good care of my baby.
l'll guard her with my life.
Bye.
Goodbye.
Brad, into the kitchen
and clean up that mess.
That's the back door. l'll get it.
Come on, Chris.
Let's go watch some TV.
- Are you coming over or what?
- No, not any more.
- Chris is here, isn't she?
- No.
Yes she is.
That's why l'm sleeping here tonight.
- l don't think so.
- Come on.
- Did you get her clothes off yet?
- Don't be crude. Get back.
You fall in love
and suddenly you're a classy guy.
- l have not fallen in love.
- What's she wearing?
- Clothes. Now get out.
- You got to see the new Playboy.
There's this girl in it
and she looks exactly like Chris.
She's got these humongous...
Oh, God...!
- Who was at the door?
- Stray dog.
What?
- Are you going to go to college?
- Huh?
Oh, great!
Thanks, mom.
- You're going to college?
- No.
- Thank God.
- Calm down.
Maybe it's Mike.
Hello?
Will you accept a collect call
from Brenda?
- Oh. Yeah, sure.
- Chris?
- Chris, it's Brenda.
- Brenda?
Chris!
- Brenda, what's wrong?
- Oh Chris, l'm in trouble.
- You're always in trouble.
- No, l'm really in trouble.
- I did it.
- You spiked her Tab with Drano?
No, l ran away from home.
You what?
- Where are you?
- l'm at the bus station downtown.
Brenda...!
- Look, just don't go anywhere.
- l don't have any money.
l spent it all on the cab here.
- Chris, l need help.
- I know.
You're in my house!
lf l take a cab to the Andersons',
could you pay for it?
Oh no, that's going to be like $40.
l don't have $40.
Well, can you pick me up?
No, l'm babysitting.
I can't call anybody else.
My dad doesn't know.
He'd kill me if he found out.
l'm begging you.
lt's really scary here.
l've seen three people shoot up,
a bald Chinese lady with no pants on,
and there's this old guy outside
who wants his slippers.
Get out of my house!
You've just moved!
Please hurry up and get here.
l've got my mom's car.
l can't drive it into the city.
Oh, my God. There's a man with a gun.
Get me the hell out of here.
Look, just hang up and sit down.
Don't move.
I'll be there in half an hour.
Please hurry. l think he's going
to kill somebody. Maybe me.
Brenda?
l don't believe this. l do not.
- Who's Mike? He your boyfriend?
- Yes.
l've got to go downtown.
Brad, will you watch Sara?
No way.
What if the house explodes?
The house is not going to explode.
You leave him here and it will.
l will be gone an hour there
and back. That's it. OK?
- You guys go steady or what?
- What?
- Do you?
- Yes. Are you two listening to me?
My mom is paying you good money
to watch me.
Brad can watch you.
Why would my mom pay you good money
for Brad to watch me?
Sara...
- Why can't we just all go?
- Because.
- Do you like him a lot?
- No. Yes.
Well, which is it?
Yes. l like him a lot.
No, Sara, your parents would die if
they found out l took you into town.
They'd die if they found out you left
me here alone with him.
Well, who's going to tell them?
- Anybody have to go to the bathroom?
-  Nope.
Come on, let's go.
Now, if anybody asks,
we went for ice cream.
- Road trip?
- Jesus!
Where are you going?
- Downtown.
- The city?
- Hey, can l go?
- No, Daryl. Go home.
- Who is this kid?
- Stray dog.
Daryl Coopersmith.
- And you're Chris Parker, right?
- Go home.
- You must be a great babysitter.
- What is he talking about?
Mr and Mrs Anderson
must really trust you
to take little kids into the city.
- Alone.
- Yeah, isn't it great?
lt is so great
that l'll get my mom to talk
to the Andersons about you.
- Then maybe you can babysit for me.
- Stop it.
And then maybe we can
drive off to New York just for kicks.
- Chris...
- Daryl...
- You think?
- What am l supposed to do?
Get in the car and run him over.
- Let him come.
- Daryl!
Sorry, can't talk. Got to run.
Will you just get in the car?
All right!
Now boys, l swear if you give me
any grief over the next 60 minutes
l swear to God l'll kill you.
Dead. Murdered. Stabbed.
- Raped?
- l am too old for this crap.
25 miles from home, girl
My feet are hurting mighty bad
Mike what?
-  Mike what what?
- What are we talking about?
- What's his last name?
- Todwell.
- Are you writing a book?
- Mike Todwell?
- Do you know him?
- They go out.
He's got a red Camaro, right?
Oh gee, Daryl.
Are you a gearhead and a sex fiend?
A lot of people have Camaros.
But do a lot of people have the
license plate SO COOL?
That's Mike.
He's the guy who beat me up for
touching his car, which l didn't do.
- That was him?
- Mike wouldn't do that.
- Yes, he would.
- He would not.
He did. He kicked my ass.
Want to see the footprint?
No.
Look.
That's where Thor lives!
Thor?
All the superheroes live in the city.
Spider-Man, Daredevil
and Captain America.
But Thor's the best.
He fights the forces of darkness.
Forces of darkness, beware.
So the babysitter goes upstairs and
the sound keeps getting louder.
Scrape, scrape, scrape.
The babysitter stops
at the kid's room.
She reaches for the doorknob.
Her hand is trembling,
her heart is beating fast.
Sweat pours down her face.
She opens the door...
and the kids are safely
in their beds.
l'd like to be safely in her bed.
- What are you guys doing back there?
- Uh, um...
Nothing. Nothing at all.
Nothing. Really.
That was my dad's, stupid.
You shouldn't have
brought it along, stupid.
- So what happens?
- OK.
But when the babysitter looks more
closely at the kids, she sees that
- they don't have any faces!
- Oh, my God!
- lt's just a pool of mushy goo.
- Like Spaghetti-O's?
- Spaghetti-O's with meat.
- Yuk!
The babysitter screams
and turns to run,
but there's this big giant hairy guy
standing right in front of her.
He raises his arm,
but there's a big metal hook
instead of a hand.
And the hook goes to her face.
Scrape, scrape, scrape!
- Oh, no.
- All right!
- You got a flat. Pull over.
- This is great.
To the right, go to the right.
- Slowly. Take it easy.
- This is not funny.
Hold it steady.
- Go slow. Pull over.
- l'm pulling over.
This is great.
Uh... where's the spare?
l don't know.
Maybe it's on the car.
You think?
OK. We are going to flag somebody
down and we'll go buy a tyre.
l've got my chequebook.
My purse.
Oh, shit!
l forgot my purse.
l don't have any money.
- l don't have my license!
- Did you forget your purse?
Yes, you little asshole.
- She's great.
- Wait, l got some money.
Here.
What, 50 cents? You don't have any
money. You're a kid, for Chrissake.
Yeah, she's right. You're a kid, for
Chrissake. You don't have any money.
Why don't you take a walk
over there, OK? Right there.
Everybody stay behind me.
You kids having some trouble?
You got a spare?
- No.
- Sara...!
You went on the expressway
without a spare?
- We're history.
- Ancient history.
Aagghh!
Just relax. Stay calm. Don't panic.
- What do you want?
- Just want to help you.
Don't listen to him. He just wants
to scrape our faces off.
What, are you scared of this?
You kids must be from the suburbs.
l suddenly feel like a total idiot.
Just stay here, OK?
l'll be right back.
Listen, l'm really sorry
for freaking out back there.
- l guess we just overreacted.
- That's OK. l'm used to it.
Listen, l appreciate this, but...
we don't have any money.
l'm stuck babysitting
for these kids, and...
l'm not supposed to be taking them
into the city like this.
l'll tell you what. l'll tow you
to town, to Dawson's garage,
and l'll buy you a tyre.
My treat, OK?
OK?
- Oh no, that wouldn't be right.
- What would be right?
Leaving you kids alone
on the expressway?
No, l guess not.
My name's Chris. Chris Parker.
Pruitt. Handsome John Pruitt.
- Hey, mister?
- Yeah, red. What?
How did... how did you...
you know... lose it?
- Lose what?
- Your hand.
Was it in 'Nam?
Nah, 'fraid not.
l was changing a tyre on a big rig
and the jack gave out.
Back of the truck fell on the hand
and popped it right off.
Vietnam...!
What did they do with the hand?
Did they bury it?
No, l wouldn't let them.
- l kept it.
- You kept it?
l got it in the glove
compartment.
- Pruitt.
- Yo.
Dawson here.
I just went by your place.
- And what did you see?
- You won't like it.
- What did you see?!
- That car was parked in front.
- She's with that bastard again.
-
Oh, my God!
- Stop, Mr Pruitt, please! Slow down.
-  This is great!
That's my mother's car!
- OK, look out, kids.
-  Oh, God!
- ls it a hand?
- No.
- Oh, good.
- lt's a gun.
Can we do that again?
-
- What's going on?
-
- Jesus!
l can't believe this.
l mean it. l'm going to kill him!
Please don't hurt him.
Everybody out.
Be careful.
- No, please!
-
My mom's car!
- Chris, get in the car.
- Hey, kids! Get out of my car!
- Come on, Sara.
- Lock the doors.
That's my car!
Get out of there.
Get out of my car!
Oh, thanks, mister.
You saved our lives.
- Chris?
- Yeah?
Um... He's a car thief.
This is a stolen car.
- No.
- Yeah.
- The chick is losing it.
- l am not.
You guys want some candy?
Brad, no chocolate. Your acne.
Sara, it is time
for your cough syrup.
Daryl, fasten the seatbelt.
She's definitely losing it.
l am not losing anything.
l am still in control here.
Got it?
Sir, would you please take us
to the next corner and drop us off?
ln this neighbourhood?
Hey, I wouldn't even get out the car
in this neighbourhood.
- Could you drop us off at a mall?
- A mall?
Where y'all think we at,
Boise, ldaho?
Man, look. l'll tell you what.
Come with me. l got a little business
to take care of
and then l can drop you
at a train station or something,
but hey, l ain't driving
to no mall. No way.
Do you promise me
you won't hurt these kids?
Yeah, l promise you.
Long way from home
Can't sleep at night
Grab your telephone cos
Something just ain't right
That's evil
Evil is going on
Well, I'm warning you girls
You better watch your happy home
Where are we going?
To hell.
Kind of exciting, don't you think?
Cos that's evil
Evil is going on
Well, I'm warning you girls
You better watch your happy home
- Did you steal all of these cars?
- Yeah. lt gets me some good money.
- lsn't it kind of dangerous?
- Hey, l like danger, all right?
You should try babysitting.
- Sir...
- Wait, wait, wait.
My name is Joe Gipp, OK?
- Mr Gipp...
- No, just Joe.
Just Joe, all right?
We have to get our car
to Dawson's garage.
- Do you think you could...
- Relax. Everything'll be OK.
All right,
it's quitting time at Tara!
- Good job. Got any defects?
- Yeah. A few.
Hi.
How you doing? l'm Brad Anderson.
Nice to meet you.
This is my sister Sara.
This is Chris Parker and that's my
best friend, Daryl Coopersmith.
Pleased to meet you. Really.
lt's great. Uh...
- Great shirt.
- What are you doing?
Hi! Nice to meet you.
lt's a nice place you got here.
Really. l love it.
- Thanks.
- Yeah, it's... great.
Look.
We sort of took a wrong turn
somewhere,
and if you don't mind,
we'd like to get out.
Mm-hm.
Damn.
Hey, don't hold it in, Graydon.
Go and get pissed, man.
You boosted a Caddie full of kids?
They got in the car
while l was still in there, man.
Was l supposed to put them out on the
street? They would have been killed.
They know where our operation is.
They could go to the cops.
Sir.
No, we wouldn't go to the cops.
How am l supposed to know that?
Uh...
Uh... Hey, we can put it in writing.
We'd all sign it.
- We can take it to a notary...
- Shut up.
Take the Brady Bunch upstairs.
We'll take care of them
after the meeting.
All right, you guys go on home.
Clear out of here!
Don't worry. We'll get home.
This has all just been a big mistake.
- But what about Brenda?
- That was her parents' mistake.
l can't see!
Oh, Chris, please hurry
and pick me up!
- lt's dead.
- Kind of like us.
- What?
- We're really in trouble.
- We're going to die here.
- No, we're not.
Oh, no. No, we are not climbing up
there. lt is much too dangerous.
Look at that.
You could poke your eyes out.
Yeah, well,
they might poke our brains out.
Dallas gets the Ferraris,
there's one Lamborghini to Phoenix
and Cleveland needs four Porsches.
- Forget that.
- But they got an order.
l said forget it. l didn't like the
way they've been running things.
Cleveland is dead.
We can go to that window.
- You got to be shitting me.
- Watch your mouth.
Watch my mouth?
You got to be shitting me.
- What if l fall?
- l won't let you fall.
Thanks, Sara.
Just be careful.
l don't think your parents will ever
ask me to babysit again.
lf they do,
l'd ask them for a buck more an hour.
Well, multiple murder
or did Sara just cut off her finger?
- l got the answering machine.
- They went for ice cream.
They're OK. Chris can handle it.
Sure! Sara's probably hanging
from the rafters by now.
Don't look down.
You idiot!
Boston, two Mercedes.
What about the Philadelphia order?
Where's the magazine?
The Playboy?
Uh... l...
l took the Playboy upstairs.
- There was this article...
- Get it.
Let's go. Come on. Hurry up.
Sara, hold on.
One BMW. lndianapolis...
- Where is it?
- lt's... not up there.
- l think the kid's got it.
- So get it back from them.
They're not up there either.
They... got away.
- Where did you get this?
- From the office.
Come on!
You're going to get us into
so much trouble.
- Hey, you kids get back here!
- Run!
Get the car.
Oh, come on. They're kids.
What are you going to do,
run them down and kill them?
Get the car.
Got to get that magazine back. lt has
my notes for the Philadelphia order.
That could
put us away for 20 years.
Faster.
Oh, no!
Hey! You kids get back here.
Come on!
ln here.
Sir, we didn't mean to interrupt
your little concert here.
We'll just get off the stage...
Nobody gets out of this place
without singing the blues.
What?
Nobody leaves this place
without singing the blues.
You want me to sing?
- They want me to sing.
- Well, do whatever they want.
- Just get us out of here.
- l can't sing.
Hi.
My name's Chris Parker.
I live in Oak Park.
That's a suburb.
They probably figured that out.
This is Brad, Sara and Daryl -
and we're in trouble.
Ain't no doubt.
See, me and my boyfriend Mike -
tonight's our anniversary.
But then he went and cancelled, and
now I'm stuck watching these three.
And it's so hard.
And it's so hard
Babysitting these guys.
? She got the...
I got this call from Brenda.
I went to pick her up.
The tyre had a blowout.
And my mom's car got... shot up.
- This guy started to chase us.
- And we all got hijacked.
- We're cruising down the highway.
- In this big old Cadillac.
And it's so hard
It's so hard
Babysitting these guys
She got the
Babysitting blues
Baby baby, babysitting blues
I've got the
Babysitting blues
Well, all right!
There are nights
You swear you were born to lose
Like tonight
And you wish your feet
Were walking in
someone else's shoes
- Some guys are out to get us
- And Brenda's probably dead
- We ain't got a nickel
- And they should be in bed
And you out of luck
Out of luck watching these guys
I've got the
Babysitting blues
Baby baby
Babysitting blues
Baby baby
Babysitting blues
There are nights
You swear you were born to lose
Like tonight
And you wish your feet were walking
In someone else's shoes
- Some guy's out to get her
- And the girl's probably dead
- She ain't got a nickel
- And we should be in bed
Well, you out of luck
Out of luck watching these guys
That's right!
I've got the
Babysitting blues
Baby baby
Babysitting blues
Baby baby
Babysitting blues
Nobody leaves this place
without singing the blues.
You were incredible.
Amazing.
- l didn't know you were so cool.
- l did.
You guys were pretty cool yourselves.
Come on.
- Where are we going?
- l don't know. Anywhere but here.
- Chris?
- Yeah?
- Can l tell you something?
- Sure.
l, uh...
l didn't really know you
until tonight.
l mean...
l knew you were pretty.
l mean, you are pretty.
Thanks. ls that your dad's building?
Yeah.
You're more than just that, though.
You're kind of smart too.
l think we should turn ourselves in.
Wait, listen to me.
The point is, l...
The point is, l...
l don't know what the hell you're
doing with Mike Todwell, OK?
What?!
l mean it. The guy is a total loser.
Daryl knows it. l know it.
lt's none of your business.
There's nothing personal, Chris. l...
l just think you should give
other guys a chance.
Like who?
- Well, like...
- Don't say it. Don't say it!
-  Like me?
- Oh no, he said it.
-
- What's so funny?
Well, it's just that you're a child.
You're just a girl in love
with an asshole.
Brad, look, l'm sorry.
l didn't mean to...
Forget it!
Chris, look where Daryl is.
l would really like to get to know
you. lf you have any time.
l have tons of time.
What are you doing? l'm trying to get
a date. You're cramping my style.
- She's too old for you.
- And you're not?
l'm his babysitter.
- How old are you?
- l'm 1 7.
So am l.
You're 1 7?
- What are you doing on the streets?
- l ran away from home.
Brenda. Come on.
Bye.
Oh Chris, why aren't you here?
Oh!
Oh, lt's a kitten!
Here, kitty kitty!
Hello. Hello.
Aaaw!
What's the matter? You got lost?
- You ran away from home.
- Drop it.
- What?
- Put the animal down.

Kitten?
- This ain't no kitten.

Aagghhh!
You wouldn't believe

Who's paying for those kids?
Somebody better pay for those kids

Well, how am l supposed to...
- l don't know anything, you know?
- You know something.
Yeah, you do, don't you?
They...
They got to get their car.
We'll get to it first.
What do those guys want?
Maybe they want to give us
a ride home.
Do you think?
Sara, honey, l think you should
lay down and get some sleep.
- l'm not tired.
- Well, pretend you're tired.
- Then can l pretend to sleep?
- Yeah, whatever.
Jesus!
Cool threads.
We'll get off at the next stop.
Now don't you even think about

Only people getting off
this here train

-  That's right!
- How you sound? This is our train.
Well, your train
is rolling in our turf.
So what?
As soon as we cross Devereaux Street

- They're going to kill each other.
- And kill us doing it.
There goes Jefferson.
There goes Jackson.
Here comes Devereaux.
Excuse me. l couldn't help but notice
that you're about to start
killing each other.
l was wondering if you could please
wait until we get off the train?
- Sit down, bitch.
- Yeah, bitch. Sit down.
Are you going to let them
get away with that?
- Wait a minute.

That was really rude.
Take it back, apologise.

- Brad, just up.
- Hey, listen to the bitch, Brad.
Watch your mouth, you...
- You big-city scum-sucker.

You just can't keep your foot
out of your mouth, can you, boy?
Let me help.
- Don't fuck with the Lords of Hell.

Don't fuck with the babysitter.
All right, baby, chill out. Shit.
The girl's crazy.
- Are you OK?
- l can't feel anything.
Don't touch it! lt could get
infected. You could get anything.
Tetanus, lockjaw,
rabies, scabies, emphysema.
Well, then don't let him walk on it.
Pick him up.
- What are we going to do with him?
- Guys, can't you read?
Take him to the hospital.
- l can't feel a thing.
- Look out for the car.
Ow! Ow!
Get the doors open, quickly.
Get out of the way!
Doctor!
Can we have a doctor? Please?
Can l help you?
We need a doctor. My friend was
wounded in a gang fight.
Calm down. l'll tell you what to do.
Wait. That's them.
Those are the kids who stole my car!
What are you bothering me for?
lt's them you want.
Brenda, if you're dead
l wish l was with you.
- Those are hot dogs, right?
- Yeah. Want one?
Yeah, l'd love one.
That'll be two bucks.
- A cheque?
- But it's a good cheque.
Chris's mom wrote it to Chris
cos Chris bought her something,
then l bought Chris some press-on
nails and she wrote it over to me.
So l'll write the check over to you
and take the hot dog.
You got a pen?
- Get out of here.
- Wait. l'm starving.
You'd rather throw it away?
- l work on a cash-only basis.
- But it's a perfectly good cheque.
No! l'll make it very clear.
You slip me the cash
and l'll slip you the wiener.
- But l don't have any cash.
- Then l don't have a wiener!
There you are.
One stitch. All better.
- One stitch?
- Yes, one stitch.
My only shot at every being in a gang
fight and all l get is one stitch?
Chris is going to think
l'm a total failure.
Dr Nuhkbane, the guy with
the stab wounds just died.
Oh, dear.
Oh, Doctor.
We're looking for a friend.
Your friend? Which one is he?
He's the one with the stab wound.
- Oh, dear.
- What?
l am sorry. Your friend is dead.
Dead?
Dead?
Dead?
Oh, Chris!
Sara, what happened?
Brad.
Brad!
Daryl, why are you hugging me?
Brad, don't you ever die on me. Ever.
OK. l won't.
What's going on?
What happened?
Oh, dear, you're her friend.
She's fainted.
l had the worst nightmare.
We were stuck in this...
- lt's really happening.
- Some night, huh?
lt's all right.
l made a mistake, see? He's fine.
Now, you children,
you stay right here.
l'll send the nurse back
with the paperwork.
Come on with me.
Paperwork. She's going to want
to know my name and stuff.
- l'm going to call my mom.
- No, no mothers.
They'll kill us. No way.
Hey, you kids!
Where's my car, goddammit?

- Heh-heh!
Babysitter! You want your car,
come on. lt's fixed. Let's go.
Hey, wait a minute there.
- What are you doing here?
- l got a little banged up.
- Where's our car?
- At Dawson's garage.

That's my fault. But Dawson's going

- Kind of like us.
- Good luck, babysitter.
- You too, Mr Pruitt!
Hey, Pruitt, stop!
Hold it right there!
Where are we going to get 50 bucks?
Maybe we could sell Daryl. You think?
We will think of something. Come on.
- Chris, l got to make.
- You got to what?
l got to go to the bathroom.
l've really got to go.
- Just try and hold it, honey, OK?
- Sounds like a party.
Looks like a party...
lt is a party!
- Daryl, get back here.
- Sorry, can't talk. Got to run.
Why do l have this feeling
we're never going to see him again?
Come on, Sara, you can go
to the bathroom in there.
I've been trying to get to you
For a long time
Seems constantly that
You were on my mind
I was thinking about
a short-cut I might take
Well, it seems like
I made a mistake

- l have to go really bad.
- ln a minute.
- What?
- l don't believe it.
- l don't believe it.
- Who is it? Some high-lQ kids?
No, stupid, it's Miss March.
There's Daryl.
No way!

This is amazing. Could you sign this?
Right here.

- Can't believe what?
- This is not me.
- lt sure is you.
lt is not.
- What's your name?
- lt's not Shaylene.
- She's not Shaylene.
- Wait a minute.
Guys, come on. Think about this.
Do you honestly believe
a Playboy centrefold
would have nothing better to do
than to show up at a Kappa party
with a bunch of kids?
- Yeah.
- Maybe.
Where's your brain?
Told you it wasn't her, stupid.
Sorry.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
l've really got to go, Chris.
- Where's your bathroom?
- lt's right that way.
l'll...
l'll take Sara to the bathroom.
One, two, three!
Aagghh!
- Hey, guys.
- l must be hallucinating.
Does anybody else see
a talking penis?
Hey, speaking of penises,

how the Playboy Unabashed Dictionary
defines oral gratification?

much. You a freshman?
Sophomore.
You can't be a junior.

I'm going to slow it down now and do
a song I wrote for the woman I love.
Do it, Bobby.
I go through each day
Hoping for something
Some little sign
So, you're babysitting these kids?
Huh! l don't think you can call it
babysitting.
I see my future in your eyes
lf they end up as drug addicts and
mass-murderers it's my fault.
Look, don't worry about it.
Everything's going to be OK.
- l think you're doing a great job.
- You do?
Sure l do. l mean,
you've gotten the kids this far.
They're still alive.
lt could be a lot worse.
lt could be.
I know how quickly time flies
I see my future in your eyes
I see my future in your eyes
Yes, I've felt the sorrow
And I've heard the crying
Believe me, I've tasted the tears
lt's always the same.
All he cares about are the Bears,
the Bengals, the Dolphins.
What about the love?
The romance?
And the sex?

Deeply.

How could a righteous babe like you

That's the sweetest thing

This is really weird.
You're weird.
- The car is fixed.

Thank you. Really.
No problem.
Why don't you go pay for the car

Yeah, l'm sure.
OK.
Take care of yourself.

-  Secret identity.
- What do you want?
Um... Mr Pruitt sent us.
This is our car.
You owe me 50 bucks.
Have you been fighting
the forces of darkness?
What is she talking about?
- She thinks you're somebody else.
- lt's him, Brad. lt's really him.
- Look, it's Thor!
- Come on, let's go.
Don't listen to him anyway.
He said you were a homo.
You spreading rumours about me, kid?
Oh, no. No, sir.
Thank you. Come on, Sara.
What's this? There's $45 here.
You owe me 50.

- Then you don't have a car.
You don't understand.
We have had an unbelievable night...
Save it!
You owe me money.
Now, you give me five bucks,
or you get out.
l thought you always helped
people in trouble.
Hey, kid, this is the city.
- l help nobody but myself.
- But l thought...
Get lost!
Wait! l know why you're not
acting like yourself.
You don't have your special helmet.
See, you're wearing the baseball hat.
You're supposed to be wearing this.
Take mine.
Go on, take it.
Take it.
You're giving this to me?
Well, yeah. You're my hero.

Man, am l up late!
Good work, Joe Gipp.
Follow them.
Stop!
Thief!
She's woken up!
Get out of my house!
Wow, look at that toy store!
Chris, look at the toy store!
- Look at all those toys!
- l can see it.
Oh, great.
What are we looking at?
Mike was supposed to
take me there tonight.
Oh-ho-ho!
- What?
- Looks like he went without you.
Check it out.
What's wrong?
Everything.
- Ahem! May l help you?
- We're just looking for somebody.
- Let's just go in and get 'em.
- Patience.
He's with Sesame Blexar.
She's such a sleaze.
He dumps you for an easy chick
and you get a night of hell.
Doesn't seem fair to me.
Stay here and watch Sara.
l will be right back.
l got to see this.
You know, Ses,
girls like you come along
once in a lifetime.
Or twice in the same night.
Oh, wow.
- How's your sister? All better
- Well...
You lied.
- No, l didn't.
- Don't lie!
Get a grip. Jesus!
A grip. Do you have any idea
what l've been through tonight?
l thought that...
l thought that...
that you loved me.
Or is it all just bullshit, huh?
Look, little girl,
l don't know what you thought we had,
but it wasn't half as serious
as you like to think it was.
All right. You let go of her.
Picking them kind of young,
aren't you?
This kid's got more class at 1 5
than you'll ever have.
- You're such a loser.
- Here we go again.
l could only dream of having somebody
like Chris for a girlfriend.
But you've got her!
- And you treat her like this?
- Don't waste your time, half-pint.
Her legs are locked together
at the knee.
l'd love to hit you.
- l'd love to pound on your face.
- Yeah? Go ahead?
But l won't.
You're so slimy,
l won't sink to your level.
l will.
- Oh! That's just great.
- See you around, Mike.
Did you see that? That was great.
We were amazing!
We were, weren't we?
lt was so cool.
- I was so cool.
- Can you believe it?
Where is Sara?
Hey, kid.
Come here for a second.
Get her.
- Mom. Dad.
-
Sara!
- Sara!
- l thought she'd be here.
Let go!
Hey, kid. Hey, hold it, man.
- Dammit.
- Sara!
Sara!
- Guys, look.
- What?
lt's my dad's building.
My mom and dad are there.
She's probably there. Come on!
Mom?
Dad?
l'll take this floor
and you take the one above.
Hey, kid. Come on out.
l just need to get something
from you.
l'm not going to hurt you.
Hey, come on, kid.
Sara!
Sara!
- Sara?
- Sara!
Sara's in trouble.
Hey! Stop! Don't go out there.
Get back here.
Hey, kid, wait.
Jesus Christ.
Hey!
Come on back up here. Come on!
- Which floor?
- We'll try this one first.
Oh God. We're at my parents' party.
Now kid, stay right where you are.
Don't move.
My parents. What are we going to do?
- l'm going out there to find Sara.
- You can't. They'll see you.
No they won't.
Stay right here. l'll be right back.
Be right back with the coats, honey.
l don't believe it.
Len Lescher. Loyola Law?
Class of '68?
- Sorry, wrong guy.
- Honey, we should be going.
- Nice meeting you.
- lt's getting kind of late.
Looking for something?
- Come on, let's go.
- Oh come on, honey.
Just one more.
My diet doesn't start till next week.
- Well, we told Chris one o'clock.
- These are so good.
Excuse me.
- You tried one of these?
- What?
They are so delicious.
l've got to get this recipe.
Do you happen to know
the name of the caterer?
Caterer?
We didn't mean to
spring it on you like this.
Hello?
You'll excuse me.
Oh, my God. ls he OK?
Did you hurt yourself?
Brad. Daryl.
- Where's Sara?
- She's out the window.
Take it easy. No rush.
What?
She must have gone upstairs and out
the window. She's out there now.
Mom? Dad?
Goddamn!
Sara, just hold on, OK?
Don't be scared.
Daryl, Brad, loosen the rope.
Come on, hurry.
Let me give you a hand.
Sara, grab the rope.
Easy, easy.
That's the most exciting thing
that's happened all night.
Just take it really slow.
Don't be scared of him, Sara.
OK, that's good. Don't look down.
OK, that's good.
Keep walking, that's right.
Just walk right by him.
Hold on.
You're almost here. Hold on, Sara.
Just walk right up it.
You're almost there. Hang on.
OK, real close. Don't worry. Grab on.
Oh, Brad!
Sara?
- Are you OK?
- Yeah. Can we go home now?
Not yet.
Look, l'm not going to hurt you,
all right? l just need the Playboy.
See, this is what they were after.
Some notes and stuff.
You know, that they need. l guess
they're pretty important to them.
- Don't say it.
-
- Wow!
- lt's pretty uncanny, huh?
She don't even compare to you.
- Well, what about him?
- Who?
Come here.
- Help!
- Uh... yeah.
Leave him hanging out there for a
while. Let him sweat it out. Come on.
Give me the magazine
and get out of here.
l'll take care of the children.
You're right.
Babysitting is dangerous.
Come on.
? 25 miles from home, girl
? My feet are hurting mighty bad
? Now I've been walking for
three days and two lonely nights
? You know that I'm mighty mad
Chris!
Oh, l'm so happy.
What took you guys so long?
You'll never believe
what l've been through tonight.
? I'm so tired
? But I just can't lose my stride
l lost my skate. lt's not here.
- Maybe you left it some place.
- We gotta go back and find it.
No, Sara honey, we can't.
- Brad?
- What?
Sara, that's not your parents' car,
is it?
-  Yes, it is.
- No!
- What are we going to do?
- Everybody duck.
Oh, my God, look at that lunatic.
Brad and Sara will be driving soon.
On the road with people like that!
- How fast do your parents drive?
- l don't know. About 45?
We'll go 80.
Brad, Sara, Daryl, upstairs now.
lnto your pyjamas.
- l don't have any pyjamas here.
- l don't care. Just go upstairs.
- Go home.
- But l don't want to go home.
You have to. l'm sorry.
l'll call you tomorrow.
Come on feet, don't fail me now
I got ten more miles to go
I got nine
Eight
Seven
Six, six, six
I got five more miles to go now
Over up the hills
just around the bend
Although my feet are tired
I can't lose my stride
I got to get to my baby again
I got to keep on walking
I got to walk on
I'm so tired
But I just can't lose my stride
- Hiya, Chris. Sorry we're late.
- Oh, that's OK.
Any problems?
No, not really. Well, Brad stayed
home and Daryl's sleeping over.
Daryl? Whoah!
What a nightmare for you.
- His head's been torn off.
- Gross!
- What happened?
- Everything is cool.
Chris, can we do this again
next Friday?
Aaw, Sara...
l think l'm retired.
You've got to sit for me again.
- We'll see, OK?
- OK.
l know that seniors don't normally
hang out with freshmen,
so if l see you around school,
and l say hi and you ignore me
as usual, it's OK.
l don't ignore friends, Brad.
Chris?
l'd just like to say thanks
for giving me what was probably
the greatest night of my life.
So far.
- Me too.
- Me too.
Me too.
- Thanks a lot.
- You're welcome.
- Bye-bye. Drive safely.
- l will, thanks.
- Hi.
- Hi!
How did you know l...
l thought the little girl
might be missing this.
She left it in the back seat.
You came all the way out here
just to return this?
Well, actually,
l was... going to ask you...
Oh, you came for the money.
No, no, no, no.
l'm looking for a babysitter.
Really?
Well...
l think tonight was my last job.
Oh.
That's too bad.
Who was the babysitter for?
Me.
Maybe retirement can wait.
Kiss him!
Well, he walked up to me
and he asked me if I wanted to dance
He looked kind of nice
and so I said I might take a chance
When he danced he held me tight
And when he walked me home
that night
All the stars were shining bright
And then he kissed me
And then he kissed me
And then he kissed me
And then he kissed me ?
