Original Air Date on June 14, 2015
== sync, corrected by  ==
Man:
The Lord of Light has made good
on his promise, my king.
His fires have melted
the snows away.
The way ahead is clear.
We ride for Winterfell.
And you will take it.
The Lord has shown me
Bolton banners burning.
You will receive
what is yours by right.
Your Grace.
Prepare to form up.
Your Grace.
Tell me.
The men, many deserted
before dawn.
Stannis:
General:
All the sellswords
with all the horses.
Your Grace.
Speak up.
Can't be worse than mutiny.
Cut her down.
General:
The Lady Melisandre
was just seen riding out of camp.
Get the men
into marching formation.
On to Winterfell.
-
-
He raised his hands
and they all stood up
at once.
Tens of thousands of them.
The biggest army in the world.
So what are you
gonna do?
I'm gonna hope they don't
learn how to climb the Wall.
But the dragonglass...
No one's ever
getting that back now.
But you killed
a white walker.
I saw them shatter steel axes
like they were glass.
- But Longclaw...
- Sam:
How many Valyrian steel swords
are left in the Seven Kingdoms?
Not enough.
The first Lord Commander
in history
to sacrifice the lives
of sworn brothers
to save the lives
of wildlings.
How's it feel to be friends
with the most hated man in Castle Black?
And I wasn't winning
any elections back then.
Here's to us, then.
Long may they sneer.
What?
I wanted to ask
you something.
To ask something of you.
Send me, Gilly,
and the baby to Oldtown
so I can become a maester.
That's what I'm meant to be.
Not this.
I need you here, Sam.
If you leave, who's left
to give me advice I trust?
Well, there's Edd.
I'd be more use
to you as a maester.
More use to everyone
now that Maester Aemon is gone.
The Citadel has the world's
greatest library.
I'll learn about history,
strategy, healing.
And other things,
things that will
help when--
when they come.
If Gilly stays here,
then she'll die.
And the baby that she named
after me will die.
And I'll end up dying, too,
trying to protect them.
Which means that the last thing that
I'll see in this world
will be the look in her eyes
when I fail them.
And I'd rather see
a thousand white walkers than see that.
Thank you.
You know that the Citadel will make you
swear off women, too.
Oh, they'll bloody try.
- Sam.
- What?
Sam.
You had just been
beaten half to death. How did you--
Oh, very carefully.
I'm glad
the end of the world's
working out well
for someone.
I'll come back.
To your return.
To my return.
Man:
Podrick:
Stannis.
Stannis Baratheon is coming.
His whole army.
How do you know
it's Stannis?
They're carrying his
flaming heart banners.
From the Blackwater.
I'll never forget it.
Trench here.
Another one 300 yards
from the castle wall.
Hurry them along.
- Right, Curlew.
- Yes, sir.
- Spread out.
- Soldier:
- Soldier #2:
- Soldier #3:
And send out
a foraging party immediately.
Siege begins
at sunrise.
There's not going
to be a siege, Your Grace.
Soldier:
-
-
-
-
-
-
- Soldier:
-
Bolton has women
fighting for him?
I don't fight
for the Boltons.
I'm Brienne of Tarth.
I was Kingsguard
to Renly Baratheon.
I was there when he was
murdered by a shadow with your face.
I did.
In the name of Renly
of House Baratheon,
First of His Name,
rightful King of the Andals
and the First Men,
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms
and Protector of the Realm,
I, Brienne of Tarth,
sentence you to die.
Do you have
any last words?
Go on, do your duty.
Looks like we're done here.
I surrender!
I surrender!
And I accept
your surrender.
Let's head back.
My wife must be lonely.
My lady.
I've come to escort you
back to your chamber.
Go with her, please.
I know what Ramsay is.
I know what
he'll do to me.
If I'm going to die,
let it happen while there's
still some of me left.
Die?
Who said anything
about dying?
You can't die.
Your father was
Warden of the North.
Ramsay needs you.
Though I suppose
he doesn't need all of you.
Just the parts he'll use
to make his heir,
until you've given him a boy or two
and he's finished using them.
Then he's got incredible
plans for those parts.
So, shall we wait
for him to come back
or should we begin now?
You're leaving it to me?
Good.
Let's begin.
Reek-- stop!
Stop!
-
- Man:
He's coming back.
-
-
I can see I have
my work cut out for me.
You two, out.
You were the first person
on my list, you know.
For killing Syrio Forel.
Remember him?
Probably not.
I've gotten a few
of the others.
The Many-Faced God stole
a few more from me.
But I'm glad
he left me you.
Do you know who I am?
I can't hear you.
-
-
You know who I am.
I'm Arya Stark.
-
-
Do you know
who you are?
You're no one.
You're nothing.
A girl has taken a life.
The wrong life.
I was right about her.
You were.
You're not ready.
Not at all.
That man's life
was not yours to take.
A girl stole from
the Many-Faced God.
Now a debt is owed.
Only death
can pay for life.
No! No!
No, you-- don't die!
Don't die!
Why are you crying?
He was my friend.
No, he wasn't.
Didn't you listen to him?
Jaqen:
But if you're--
who's this?
Jaqen:
Just as a girl should have been
before she took a face from the hall.
You are still someone.
And to someone,
the faces are as good
as poison.
I can't see.
What's happening?
What's happening?!
- Doran:
- Thank you.
Forgive me, child.
I wish you all the happiness
in the world.
Maybe I'll come
visit you sometime.
Maybe I'll come
visit you.
Don't wait too long.
Got a noblewoman
to marry back home.
You want a good girl,
but you need
the bad pussy.
Jaime:
Try not to lose it
this time.
I'll never
take it off again.
I know you didn't
want to leave Dorne,
but I'm glad
you're coming home.
Your mother's desperate
to see you.
I'm glad Trystane
is coming with us.
He seems like a nice boy.
You're lucky.
Arranged marriages
are rarely so--
so well arranged.
Do you think Mother
will like him?
If she sees you're happy,
I'm sure she will.
You really believe that?
Have you ever known
your mother to like anyone
aside from her children?
She likes you.
I'm not so sure
about that.
Listen...
there's something
I wanted to tell you.
Something I should
have told you long ago.
So...
now that you've seen
more of the world,
you've learned how complicated
things can be,
people can be.
The Lannisters and the Martells have
hated each other for years,
but you've fallen
in love with Trystane.
It was an accident, really.
I mean, what were the chances?
You happen to fall
in love with the man
you were assigned
to marry?
My point is...
we don't choose
whom we love.
It just, well--
it's beyond our control.
- I sound like an idiot.
- No, you don't.
What I'm trying to say--
what I'm trying
and failing to say--
I know what
you're trying to say.
No, I'm afraid you don't.
I do.
I know.
About you and Mother.
I think a part of me
always knew.
And I'm glad.
I'm glad
that you're my father.
Myrcella?
Myrcella?
Myrcella?
Myrcella?
You love her,
don't you?
How could you not?
Of course it's hopeless
for the both of you.
A sellsword from the fighting pits,
a disgraced knight.
Neither one of you
is fit consort for a queen.
But we always want
the wrong woman.
Does he always
talk so much?
Jorah the Andal.
Torgo Nudho.
He should not be here.
No, but he is.
Our queen ordered him
exiled from city.
Our queen would be dead
if not for him.
Thank you.
I am sorry.
Sorry I not there
to fight for our queen.
You missed a good scrap.
None of that matters now.
The longer we sit
here bantering,
the longer Daenerys is out there
in the wilderness.
He's right.
The dragon headed north.
If we're going to find her,
that's where we'll have to go.
We?
You're a Lannister.
The queen intends to remove
your family from power.
And I intend
to help her do it.
You've been here
for how many days now?
I've fought
for her for years.
Since she was little
more than a child.
- You betrayed her.
- Careful now.
And she exiled you.
Twice, I believe.
The second time
thanks to you.
Don't blame me
for your crimes, Mormont.
He's right.
Our queen exiled Jorah.
And he's right.
Jorah saved her life.
Perhaps she feels
differently about him now.
Perhaps not. The only way
we'll know is if we ask her.
Tyrion:
Just as long as he promises
not to kill me in my sleep.
If I ever kill you,
your eyes will be wide open.
Forgive me, but why would
we bring you?
Pardon me?
Have you ever tracked
animals in the wilderness?
Not precisely, but I have other skills
that would be useful.
Can you fight?
I have fought.
I don't claim to be
a great warrior.
Are you good
on a horse?
Middling.
So mainly you talk.
And drink.
I've survived so far.
Which I respect, but you would
not help us on this expedition.
You would help us
here in Meereen, though.
None of us have experience
governing a city
except for him.
You want to prove
your value to the queen?
Prove it right here
in Meereen.
He's a foreign dwarf
that barely speaks the language.
Why would the Meereenese
listen to him?
They wouldn't.
They will listen
to Grey Worm.
I'll come with you.
I'll find our queen.
- You are not strong enough to go anywhere.
- I am.
He is. He's the toughest man
with no balls I ever met.
But you still can't go.
The people believe in you.
They know you speak
for the queen.
It's true.
Only the Unsullied can keep
the peace in Meereen.
If you leave, half this city will
consume the other half.
And Missandei.
Our queen trusts no one
more than Missandei.
Certainly not me.
The queen's
closest confidante,
the commander
of the Unsullied,
and a foreign dwarf
with a scarred face.
Good fortune,
my friends.
Meereen is ancient
and glorious.
Try not to ruin her.
Looks like it's you and me,
Jorah the Andal.
Let's find
some good horses.
We have so much
to talk about.
Varys:
Hello, old friend.
I thought we were so happy together
until you abandoned me.
I suppose there's no point
asking how you found me.
The birds sing in the west,
the birds sing in the east,
if one knows
how to listen.
They tell me you've
already found favor
with the Mother
of Dragons.
Well, she didn't
execute me,
so that's
a promising start.
Now the heroes
are off to find her
and I'm stuck here
trying to placate a city
on the brink of civil war.
Any advice
for an old comrade?
Information is the key.
You need to learn
your enemy's strengths and strategies.
You need to learn which of your friends
are not your friends.
If only I knew someone
with a vast network of spies.
If only.
A grand old city
choking on violence,
corruption, and deceit.
Who could possibly
have any experience
managing such a massive,
ungainly beast?
I did miss you.
Oh, I know.
We have to go home.
Oh, my poor,
sweet thing.
Does it hurt?
We have to go home.
Drogon.
Can you take me
back to Meereen?
How far
did you carry me?
Drogon, we need
to return.
My people need me.
Well, there's no food.
At the very least,
you could hunt us some supper.
Confess.
Confess.
I have sinned.
I see that now.
How can I have been
so blind for so long?
I want to be clean again.
I want absolution.
The Crone came to me
with her lamp raised high.
And by its holy light--
You wish to make
a confession?
Once I've confessed,
will I be free?
Your Grace will be
dealt with according to her sins.
The Mother have
mercy, then.
I lay with a man outside
the bonds of marriage. I confess.
Name him.
Lancel Lannister.
Your cousin
and the king's squire.
- I was lonely and afraid.
- You had a husband.
A husband off whoring
every chance he--
His sins do not
pardon your own.
May the gods forgive me.
Other men?
No.
No others?
No.
I do.
There are those
that say your children
were not fathered
by King Robert,
that they are bastards
born of incest and adultery.
A lie.
A lie from the lips
of Stannis Baratheon.
He wants the throne, but his brother's
So he claims they are
not his brother's.
That filth.
There is not one shred
of truth to it.
I deny it.
Good.
But these
are terrible charges.
And the realm must know
the truth of them.
If Your Grace has given
honest testimony,
your trial will prove
your innocence.
Trial?
I have confessed.
To a single sin.
Others you have denied.
Your trial will separate the truths
from the falsehoods.
I bow to the wisdom
of Your High Holiness.
But if I might beg
for just one drop
of the Mother's mercy.
I haven't seen my son--
I don't know
how long it's been.
I need to see him, please.
You have taken the first step on the path
back to righteousness.
In light of this,
I will permit you
to return to the Red Keep.
Thank you.
Thank you.
The Mother is merciful.
It is her
you should thank.
I will. I will.
I swear it,
day and night.
Good.
Am I free to go?
After your atonement.
My atonement?
A sinner
comes before you.
Cersei of House Lannister.
Mother to His Grace
King Tommen.
Widow of His Grace
King Robert.
She has committed
the acts of falsehood
and fornication.
to you,
the good people
of the city.
She comes before you
with a solemn heart,
shorn of secrets,
to make her walk
of atonement.

Your Grace.
It's good
to have you back.
Come.
We'll take you inside.
I need to have a look
at those feet.
-
-
May I have the honor of presenting
the newest member of the Kingsguard?
If it please Your Grace,
he has taken a holy vow of silence.
He has sworn
that he will not speak
until all His Grace's
enemies are dead
and evil has been
driven from the realm.
Who came to your aid?
Stannis.
Now he needs you.
We don't have enough men
to make any difference.
The wildlings will make
a difference.
The wildlings will never
fight for Stannis.
- I told him before.
- You saved their bloody lives.
If they're gonna live
in the Seven Kingdoms,
safe behind Wall,
they ought to fight for the damn place.
- It's not their fight.
- Man:
Stannis?
Shireen?
The princess?
Lord Commander.
Says he's still alive.
Are you sure
he's talking about Benjen?
Said he was
First Ranger.
Said he knows
where to find him.
Man says he saw
your uncle at Hardhome
at the last full moon.
- Could be lying.
- Could be.
There are ways
to find out.
- Where is he?
- Over there.
For the Watch.
For the Watch.
For the Watch.
-
- For the Watch.
-
- For the Watch.
Olly...
For the Watch.
