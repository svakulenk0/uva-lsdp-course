Richard, don't go out too far.
Em's a fraidy cat!
Richard! Emmeline!
Come back here this minute.
And be careful.
What's gotten into you, Richard?
Bad enough to endanger yourself,
but to encourage Emmeline...
I'm sorry, Father.
I know you want to have fun.
All I'm trying to do is get us all
to San Francisco in one piece.
Will Mommy be coming to San Fr'isco?
I don't believe so, Richard.
I told you. Once they go to heaven...
...they don't come back.
Isn't that right, Uncle Arthur?
My mommy and daddy haven't come back.
Because God wants them to stay...
...and do his work and wait for the day...
...when you will take
the long voyage to see them.
When will that be?
When you've lived a full life...
...and experienced all that it has to offer.
Look!
Father, what are they called?
Sharks.
I wish I had a hook. I'd pull 'em aboard
and the cook would fry 'em for dinner.
Captain, do you know
there's a fog bank coming in?
I'm aware of that fact, sir.
I heard one of the men say
those storms rounding the cape...
...pushed us far west of our course.
That's right, sir.
Last night's celestial puts us about here.
Richard, what are you looking at?
They don't have any clothes on.
What the hell are you two doing here?
I'll teach you, bucko!
Come here.
Don't you dare hurt him.
You want a hiding, too, do you?
- Fire!
- Fire?
Did somebody say "fire"?
Man the pumps.
- Button.
- Yes, sir?
Take the children and Mr. Lestrange
and row them away from the ship.
Come on.
Mr. Lestrange.
There's blasting powder in that hold.
I saw them load it.
Keep moving!
Come on, will you?
Come on, you.
Uncle Arthur!
Richard! Emmeline!
- This way, Lestrange.
- The children!
They've already taken their leave.
Follow me, sir.
No, there is no more room.
Lower away!
Abandon ship!
Don't explode yet!
Further.
What's happening? I can't see.
- What was that?
- The ship. Cover your faces.
Richard!
Emmeline!
Uncle Arthur!
There they are!
Where?
Captain, over here.
Richard!
Hello.
Father!
Don't go shouting both at once.
I won't know which way to steer.
Longboat, ahoy! Where are you?
Hello!
Father!
Gone.
Lord, help us.
Where is Father?
What is your name?
Paddy Button. Now, belay your questions.
Can't you see I'm busy?
Damn it. No food or water.
That's Chopin. I can play it on the piano.
Mr. Button, can I ask you a question?
Yes.
Are you a pirate?
I'm thirsty.
Me, too.
Listen...
...you'll hear it hiss
when it touches the water.
- You hear it?
- I think so.
I don't hear anything.
Listen harder.
It must be fairly boilin' by now.
There. Do you hear it?
I hear it. Don't you hear it now, Em?
I think so.
Yes, I hear it.
I smell flowers.
Flowers?
Mr. Button! Richard! Look!
It's land!
Land ho!
We're saved.
I would never have believed it.
Where are we?
Nirvana, that's where we are. No more
"yes, sir," "no, sir," for Paddy Button.
No more breaking my back
over a stinkin' stove.
Will Father be coming to fetch us?
Come on, let's look around.
Listen.
Come on.
I knew it.
It's lovely.
Water.
Ho, down there! Look out below!
Mr. Button, there's a barrel over here...
...with funny stuff in it
that smells like the Captain's breath.
The Captain's breath?
It's rum.
Sweet Jesus.
Look what a funny thing I found.
It's got holes in it.
Give me that. Where did you get it?
- What was it?
- We'd better get out of here.
There's a bunch of them up there.
Come on, let's get out of here.
Hurry it up, will you?
I don't see Father's boat.
No, not yet. Maybe he'll be along later.
Maybe not.
Take them things out of your mouth!
Open your mouth!
Take them out of your mouth!
Spit them out! Go on!
Don't cry. I ain't mad at you.
If you eat them berries, you'll go to sleep.
You'll never wake up again.
They're never-wake-up berries, you see?
Just leave them berries alone. Come on.
We had a cat once
that went to sleep and never woke up.
Uncle Arthur said she was dead and buried.
Mr. Button, do you think she ate
some of those berries?
Maybe.
What does it really mean, Paddy,
"dead and buried"?
It means that they put you in the ground
and they cover you up.
And you're dead and buried, do you see?
Like Mrs. Jones' baby. Remember, Em?
The doctor dug it out of the cabbage patch.
The cabbage patch?
That's right.
But he took it back and planted it again.
So it could grow and turn into an angel.
I got a trowel
and dug our cabbage patch all up.
But there weren't any babies or any angels.
Only worms.
What's in them pictures, Richard?
It's a story about these funny people
who get married.
There is a saying under each one.
Give us a look.
Yeah.
Were you ever married, Paddy?
Seven times.
Kids in every port from Callao to Macao.
Seventeen at the last count.
Never set eyes on a single of them.
Slanted-eyed little devils...
...black little devils,
even a couple of pink ones like you.
And all with my eyes.
Paddy, what's "subjugation"?
Something I've been trying to avoid
all my life.
Come back here. This ain't gonna hurt you.
We don't want to go swimming!
We don't have our bathing costumes!
To hell with your bathing costumes!
You don't wear them
when you have a bath, do you?
This isn't a bathtub. This is the ocean!
Ready, go. That's it.
Whenever you see a ship,
you run down quick...
...and you light the signal fire.
Do you hear me?
There's the rabbit hole...
There's a fox, see. Pull it tight.
There's a knot. Do it.
Run your finger up like that.
You shove that around under there.
There you are. Put it there, shipmate.
Where'd you find that?
I didn't find it.
I made it from the knots you taught me.
You made it? Well...
...pity it's not a bit bigger.
Let's go swimming.
Yeah.
Come back here and put your clothes on!
I don't want to wear my old britches.
It ain't proper to be
running around naked all the time.
Alone at last.
Richard, Emmeline,
I want you both to promise me something.
I want you to promise me
that you will never, ever go over...
...to the other side of the island.
Why, Paddy?
Why? Because I tell you, that's why!
There's nasty things go on over there, see?
Vile, evil, sinister things.
Like what?
Yes, Mr. Button, like what?
Well, for a start,
that's where the bogeyman lives.
The bogeyman?
That's right. And you know what happens
when the bogeyman...
...gets his hands on little people
like yourselves?
Why, he just eats them.
He pops them into his mouth like candy...
...and he chews them up
and he swallows them, bones and all.
Do you know what "law" is?
Good. From now on, that's the law, see?
No one goes over to the other side.
You look funny.
Children, where are you?
Look at me.
Look at me.
You're silly
when you drink out of that barrel.
This is a serious dance.
Sing the one
about the Hoochie Coochie girls.
Come on. Are you ready?
Where's Paddy?
He's gone.
There he is.
He must have swum over there
and gone to sleep. Come on.
What are you doing that for?
I'm going to put it on Mr. Button's head,
so when you say "boo" into his ear...
...he'll jump up with it on.
Paddy, wake up, it's us.
Wake up!
Don't worry, Em, we'll be all right.
Take me away from this place, Richard.
Look!
This looks like a good place
to stay for awhile.
Wake up. It's Christmas morning.
Christmas?
Yesterday, I counted 52 big marks
on the tree and last night he came.
What are you talking about?
Santa Claus. I saw all his reindeer
right there on the beach.
Let's see if he brought us anything.
Come on, Em, hurry.
That's where the reindeer were, see?
Look at our stockings.
And there's something in them!
Look, just what I always wanted.
What are they?
What do they look like? They're marbles.
See, these are your Jaspers
and these are your Peewees.
You did it all.
But...
Fooled ya, didn't I?
You!
Why are we always fighting so much?
I don't know.
That should be our New Year's revolution:
to stop fighting so much.
- I'll try, but...
- But, what?
I don't know what's wrong with me
when I say the things I say.
I just keep on having
all these strange thoughts.
What kind of thoughts?
Just thoughts.
Funny thoughts about you and me.
Tell me.
I couldn't.
They're just thoughts.
They don't mean anything.
Where did you find these?
I found them in those little shells.
They're beautiful. Thank you.
"O come, all ye faithful"
"O little town of Bethlehem"
"Dashing through the snow
In a one-horse open sleigh
"All the"
Help!
What's wrong?
You're bleeding.
Don't! I'm all right.
But you're bleeding.
Go away! Don't look at me.
Go away!
What was it, Em?
- Why were you bleeding like that?
- I don't know.
Liar!
It's true, I don't know.
People don't bleed like that
unless they've cut themselves.
Maybe you're hurt real bad
and you just don't know it.
- Let me look.
- No! I don't want you to look.
- But, why?
- Just because.
That is not fair.
I don't keep any secrets from you.
I tell you everything.
Everything.
What are you looking at?
Your muscles.
What about them?
You're really acting silly lately.
Always saying dumb things like that.
Always looking at me funny.
You're not coming down with something,
are you?
Well, don't give it to me.
Tell me again.
- Where are your mother and father?
- In heaven.
But where's heaven?
You know, up there.
- Your father might be there, too.
- No, he's not.
He's coming on a ship someday
to take us home.
Do you hear it?
No.
Do you ever hear it?
Sometimes I think I do.
I think Paddy was a liar.
He told us there was a pot of gold
at the end of every rainbow...
...and that was a lie.
He told us if we dug far enough
we'd reach China.
And Santa Claus never came.
Do you ever think about him?
I do.
I know you don't like to talk about it, but...
...don't you ever wonder
what really happened?
I don't want to know what happened.
I do.
There are so many things
I don't understand.
Why do fish stop swimming and lie on top
of the tide pools after it rains?
Why do you hear the waves
inside the big shells?
Why are all these funny hairs
growing on me?
I wish a big book with all the answers
to every question in the world...
...would drop out of the sky
and land in my hand right now.
- I'd read it till I knew everything.
- You can't know everything.
Only God knows everything.
God?
He can't find us
any better than Santa Claus.
I wonder what fish think about?
What are you doing?
Trying to cheer you up. Come on, laugh.
It's not going to work.
There it is again.
Do you think it's the bogeyman?
Maybe it's another person.
No...
...or he would have come over
to meet us and say hello.
That's the proper thing to do.
What if he's not nice?
What if he wants to hurt us?
Then I'll spear him.
Look! I'm the greatest fisherman
who ever lived.
I'm the greatest fisherman who ever lived.
While you scare them off,
I catch as many as I want to.
That's my fish dance!
It doesn't scare them off.
It brings them up to the surface
where I can spear them.
Who cares what you say?
It's not how many you catch.
It's how you do it.
Stop that!
Please play something else.
Why must you do that
when you know it makes me angry?
"It doesn't scare them away.
It brings 'em to the top...
"...where I can spear them."
I'll spear you.
Here I am.
Come back here...
...or I'll pull your britches down
and take a switch to you.
Don't you dare try to spank me. I mean it.
I'll put never-wake-up berries in your food!
I mean it.
Say, "Richard is the smartest person
on the island."
- Say it!
- Stop it, Richard. I'm getting angry.
- Stop it! Now get off.
- Say it!
Richard is the smartest person
on the island.
- The fastest swimmer.
- The fastest swimmer.
- The fastest runner.
- The fastest runner.
- The best hut builder.
- You're the best everything. Now get off!
It's true.
Just you wait.
You'll never know when it'll happen.
Just one little bite
and you'll never wake up again.
- What is it? What happened?
- I saw him.
- Who?
- The face Paddy thought was a bogeyman.
- You went to the other side?
- He's not the bogeyman.
I think he's God.
God?
He looks like Pastor Logan said
he looked like:
"You'd better be good or else."
And he was bleeding.
- I don't believe you.
- Just like Jesus.
Don't go there again. It's the law.
What if he really is God?
Shouldn't we go and pray?
Or won't he be mad
and not let us go to heaven?
I don't want to talk about it.
What is it?
I'm here.
- You ate the "dead and berries"...
- No, I'm fine.
- You just had a bad dream.
- Don't ever leave me.
Promise you won't.
Promise you'll always be with me.
I promise.
Don't.
What are you doing?
Go away!
Where are you going?
Wait. What's the matter?
- What are you doing?
- What do you want?
Why won't you talk to me?
Just leave me alone.
A ship, Emmeline!
The signal fire, you didn't light it.
Why didn't you light it?
You know how much I want to leave.
It's the most important thing to me.
I know.
First you cry for help,
then you throw sticks at me.
A ship comes, a ship!
The first ship we've seen
since we've been here and you let it go by.
Well, that's it. I've had it.
I'm sick and tired
of waiting for you to get better.
I'm going to San Fr'isco without you.
You'll never build a boat strong enough
to get to San Fr'isco.
That's the fourth time you've tried
and they've all sunk.
Shut up!
Why don't you give up?
You don't even know where San Fr'isco is.
You're such a silly dodo.
We're never getting off this island.
Thanks to you.
This is where we live.
This is our home, now and forever.
No!
I could never live here forever
with just you.
I don't even like you.
You never used to laugh at me.
You never used to have secrets.
You're not so perfect either,
Mr. Richard Lestrange.
I've seen you playing with it.
And I'll tell your father if he ever gets here.
You. I hate you.
You almost hit me.
- Take back what you said.
- I've seen it all.
What happens after you do it a long time.
Shut up! That isn't fair, peeking.
- I don't peek on you.
- That's a lie.
You're always staring at my buppies.
Only because they look so funny.
You know what you look like now?
You look like
one of those pictures Paddy had.
One of his Hoochie Coochie girls.
I do not!
Stop that, or I'll never talk to you again.
See them jiggle, wiggle and shake.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hit you.
I wish you were dead and buried.
What are you doing?
It's my hut. I built it.
That's not true. I helped you.
I did most of it.
You can find some other place to live.
I said I was sorry, Richard.
What more do you want me to say?
I don't want you to say anything.
I don't ever want to see you again.
You just wait, Richard Lestrange.
I'll get you for this!
What's wrong with you?
Go away.
What happened?
I stepped on one of those fish
that looks like a rock.
Don't go to sleep.
Oh, no. Please wake up.
God.
Take me to God.
But the law...
God...
...please don't make Em never wake up.
I didn't mean it when I said
I wanted her dead and buried.
I forgot most of my prayers, God...
But...
Our Father...
...who art in heaven...
...kingdom come...
...with liberty and justice for all.
Amen.
Em, are you all right?
I've been so worried.
You mean, you're not mad at me anymore?
Of course not.
I was so scared.
All I could think of was:
What if I lost my Em?
What would I do?
Here's some food
to help you get your strength back.
Do you see that island out there?
Yes.
I've been thinking, maybe the person
who makes the drum noise...
...lives there and then comes here to pray.
Maybe.
Would you like to try to walk?
You all right?
Yes.
Kiss me.
You're all sticky.
So what? Kiss me.
Stop it, I can't breath.
But I don't want to stop.
What are you doing?
Stop it.
I feel so funny in my stomach.
Me, too.
My heart is beating so fast.
Mine, too.
Will you stop eating? You're getting fat.
Come on up, keep me warm?
Where's Em, Coco?
I'm sorry, Richard.
You didn't want it all day yesterday either.
What's the matter?
Don't you love me anymore?
Yes, I love you more than ever, Richard.
Then why don't you want to do it?
It just hurts right now, that's all.
When it stops hurting, we'll do it.
When is that going to be?
I don't understand. Why does it hurt?
I don't know.
I don't know anything.
But if you touch my tummy right now,
you can feel it.
Feel what?
How did you make
your tummy move like that?
I'm not doing it.
It's not doing it by itself.
Yes, it is.
There. I felt it again.
What's making it do that?
I don't know.
Where are you?
Where are you?
What's wrong? Did they hurt you?
They?
What is it? Tell me what to do.
What is it?
Answer me.
Why did you have a baby?
I don't know.
Hello, baby.
Look, I think he's hungry.
What do you feed him?
Try some fruit.
Here you go.
Good food. Fruit.
It doesn't like it.
Here, let me try this.
What do I do?
Why are you doing that?
The drum people.
What?
I saw them.
When?
The night he came.
What did they look like?
I don't want to talk about it.
Paddy was right.
We shouldn't have gone to the other side.
We should have never broken the law.
- Do they know we're here?
- I don't think so.
If they come,
I'll do to them what I do to the fish.
I'll stick it through their eyes!
I'll stick it through their bellies
and watch their guts come out!
Remember on the ship
when we tried to get to the dinghy...
...how the men
pushed and shoved each other?
How their eyes looked?
It was the same with the drum people.
I don't understand. Why do people
have to be so bad to each other?
Come here, hurry.
I'm busy keeping watch.
Come on, you have to see this.
You taught him to swim.
Water.
Look at the fishies.
Around the tree and back down the hole.
Get the boat.
Look at the bird. Look, Paddy.
Do you see some fishies?
What do you see?
Tell me, do you see a ship?
Paddy, fan.
Richard.
He said my name.
Look, Paddy, we're making footprints.
Like Boston in the winter.
Remember the snowball fights we had
every time it snowed?
See, it's freezing.
It's cold.
The bogeyman.
You better bring him up to see
or he'll hear about it from the crew...
...and we'll have to sail back tomorrow.
Excuse me, sir.
We sighted something.
There.
What do you think?
Can we go closer?
I'll see,
but we have to be careful of that reef.
Look at that face.
Boat.
No, that couldn't be them.
Do you know how to get to
the place where we lived with Paddy?
Sure. I go there for bananas.
Take me there?
I thought you were afraid.
I want to see it again.
In you go.
You coming?
Shark!
I have to get the oars.
Help me, Em, we're drifting.
Go away.
Look how far out we are!
I can't stop this.
Paddy, look.
When it hits the water,
you can hear it hiss.
Look, see?
Hear it?
I'm thirsty.
I wish we had some water.
Fishies.
No, Paddy!
- Where did you get those?
- Get those out of your mouth.
What are you doing?
Get those out of your mouth.
He swallowed some.
Come here.
Don't close your eyes, Paddy.
Please don't go to sleep.
Please.
Three points to port, sir.
Looks to be a small craft.
See anyone in it?
I can't make it out.
Captain, three points to port.
Are they dead?
No, sir. They're asleep.
