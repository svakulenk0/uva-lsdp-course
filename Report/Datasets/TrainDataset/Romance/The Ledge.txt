- You know, I'm not really sure
I even want to do this,
but this couple
down at the precinct,
they been at me for this
for a year now.
We've known 'em for 15 years,
I mean, Don and Jan Connolly.
They're real good people,
but, you know,
but they can't have kids,
so he goes, you know,
"If I had a child, I would
want him to be like Hollis."
Shoot, I ain't even told
my wife.
- Mr. Lucetti.
Mr. Lucetti.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm just so nervous.
This ain't my normal routine,
you know,
in a jar before breakfast.
- Hollis.
- Yes, Doc?
- This woman is not going
to be having your baby.
- Why?
- You have a birth defect.
- You mean I'm infertile?
Sterile?
- Everything else functions,
but...
- Have I always been infertile?
- Yes.
I'm afraid so.
-
- We got a jumper.
He's on the roof
at the Tamlacker Building.
- Look, I'm not feeling
so well today.
- Well, I'll get Partridge in
to relieve you.
Let's go.
- Please stay behind
the barricade, ma'am.
- Hey, how you doing?
I'm Hollis.
- You a cop?
- Yes, but it's okay.
You can call me Hollis
or Holly.
Some of my friends
call me Holly.
- Is this your specialty,
Hollis?
- Well, I'm a detective
in this precinct,
and I do other work,
but I take care
of this kind of thing too.
- What's your success rate?
- It's decent.
Tell me,
what's your name?
- Gavin.
- Are you married, Gavin?
- No.
- Then what in the hell
are you doing up here?
- That was a joke?
- It was an attempt at a joke.
- Well, you're married,
obviously.
- Listen, I'm trained to talk
to you for hours on end,
and I'll go around and around
in circles until you're so dizzy
that you fall off of here,
but my gut tells me that you're
too smart for the standard bull,
so why don't we
just cut right to it
and you tell me
what's your problem?
- No, I think I'd like to go
around in circles for a while.
- Okay.
- So how long you been together,
you and your wife?
- 15 years.
- Is the sex still good?
- Do we have to talk
about this, Gavin?
- No.
I could jump.
- Yeah, well, from way up here,
there's nothing we can put down
that's gonna save you.
You know that, right?
- So is it still good?
- Better than when we first met.
- Isn't it usually
the other way around?
I mean, isn't that the way
it's supposed to go?
- Yeah, a lot of things
that are supposed to go one way
end up going the other.
That's one of the things
you learn in my job.
- You been faithful?
- Yes.
But on the subject of faith...
Do you have any?
- Do you?
- Yes.
I'm Catholic.
So no faith, huh?
You got you a girlfriend?
- Not exactly.
- I understand.
You one of them gay guys, huh?
- No.
Although I do live with one.
He got kicked out of his job
when they found out
he was HIV-positive.
I took him in,
helped him get a newjob.
And now he's-
- Gavin!
Hey!
What are you doing?
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Gavin!
Gavin, stop for a second, man.
- What are you doing?
- Gavin.
- Fuck me.
Why is this so hard?
- You don't have to do this,
you know.
You really don't.
- No, actually, I do.
And when I'm gone,
you're gonna have to take care
of something for me, okay?
- I won't do it.
If you got something
that you need to handle,
I suggest you climb in here
and you take care of it
yourself.
- I can't.
- You're not up here by choice,
are you?
- No.
I have to stay up here
until noon
and then jump.
If I don't,
someone else is gonna die.
- Why?
- Mornin'.
- How's it goin'?
- Good.
- Morning, sir.
- Hey, guys.
Oh, please, come on in.
- You used to be a teacher,
right?
- Yeah.
- So I'm in
this art history class,
and we're studying
religious art,
and my assignment this week
is to write about an object
that's sacred to me to which
I have an emotional attachment,
and I need your advice.
- Okay.
- I found this
in one of the rooms,
and I'm thinking, tonight,
I'm gonna have
a religious experience.
- So your question is,
"Does having
a religious experience
"with this
intimidatingly large dildo
transform it
into a sacred object?"
- You're so smart, Gavin.
- Well, it's highly
questionable.
Maybe the real question
here is,
"Is your attachment to this
going to be emotional?"
- Oh, my emotions
get aroused pretty easily.
- I'll bet they do.
- Although looking at Buzz here
and then looking at you,
I can't help but think
"three-way."
- Jesus Christ.
I always enjoy
talking to you, Harper,
but you're gonna get me fired.
- Come on,
I'm just flirting with you.
- It's a slippery slope.
- How would you know?
- Good one.
Haven't you got some work to do?
- Oh.
Oh. This is Shana Harris.
She's in
the art history class too.
Looking for a job,
so be nice to her.
But not too nice.
- I didn't realize
you worked here.
- No, I don't work very hard.
- Does that make it
less of a coincidence?
- I'm Gavin.
Assistant manager.
Please have a seat.
You live with that guy?
- Yeah. We only just moved in.
- How do you like it?
- I like it.
My husband's not so sure.
- What's your major?
- Accounting.
- Ah.
- I always thought
I'd do something in music.
I took lessons as a kid.
But got to earn a living,
you know?
- People don't earn a living
with music?
- I'm just looking
for a part-time job
to help with tuition.
I'm a serious person,
and I'm very hardworking.
I could do anything.
- What do you play?
- I play piano,
but we don't have one right now,
so I'm actually learning guitar.
- Cool.
Well, start when you want.
- Really?
- Hey, it's not my hotel.
What do I care?
- Thank you.
- So I see this very pretty girl
comin' out of 213.
- Yeah. Shana.
Married.
- Right, Shana.
How'd you know that?
- Little early for whiskey,
don't you think?
- It's Saturday.
- Yeah.
- I've spoken with her
a couple times in the hallway.
They just moved in.
- Anyhow, I see her
saying good-bye to the guy,
the husband.
- Yeah?
- Next thing I know,
she's on the bus.
Then she's at the hotel,
wanting a job.
- I suppose you think that's all
just coincidence, right?
- Well, yeah, Chris.
Why else would I be telling you?
What else would it be?
- Why can't you just accept
that things have meaning, Gavin?
-
Meaning.
What possible meaning
could that have?
- Connections.
Destiny.
- She's married.
Where's the destiny in that?
- Why do you always
have to be so rational?
- Why is it wrong
to be rational?
- Okay, we're gonna get
into a fight.
- So how was your week?
- Full of light.
- Fuck off.
Both:
Hi.
- Hey.
- My wife tells me
you're her new boss.
- Yeah.
Well, sort of.
- I'm Joe Harris.
How's it goin'?
- Gavin.
This is Chris.
- Hey. Hi.
- Hi.
Both:
Hi.
- How are you, Shana?
- I'm good, thank you.
- You guys want to come in
for a beer, sandwich?
- Uh, no, thank you.
Actually, we wanted
to invite you guys
over for dinner
some night.
- Great.
Any night but Fridays.
- How about Wednesday?
- Good.
- Sure. Why not?
Can you email directions?
- 7:00?
- Fine.
Lookin' forward to it.
- Great.
- Bye.
Front desk: Landon.
How's it goin', Landon?
- Fine, sir.
- The geniuses at head office
want to get rid of him,
project a younger image.
I tell 'em
he goes, I go.
Reservations: Selena,
the most inhospitable
reservationist
in the hospitality industry.
Probably responsible for 50%
of the empty rooms in the hotel.
Right, Selena?
- Hi, Papi.
- Don't call me Papi.
Head of security.
We all feel much safer
knowing he's asleep in here.
So I don't have any room service
slots available yet,
but you can do
some housekeeping shifts,
and then I'll switch you over.
I'll assign you your own floor.
That way, I can tell
from the complaints
if it's you
who's screwing things up.
Consuela, this is Shana.
- Hi.
- Show her how to do
a housekeeping shift, okay?
- Sure.
- Show a little respect.
I'll see you later.
- Hi.
- Hey.
- Hi, guys.
Come on in.
- Thanks.
How's it goin'?
- Good. How are you?
- Gavin.
- Hey.
- Chris, how are you?
- Hi.
This is lovely.
- Thank you.
- Here.
- Oh, thank you.
- Yeah, you're welcome.
- Thank you for the gift.
- We need this.
- Please sit down.
Would you like
a glass of wine?
- Sure, thanks.
- Shana.
- I could do that if you like.
- Thank you for having us over.
That's very nice of you.
- Our pleasure.
- Thanks.
Is that yours?
- Oh, yeah.
But I wore out the strings.
- How's school going?
- It's okay.
- You doing that same essay
as Harper, sacred object?
- Yeah.
- So what's your sacred object
gonna be?
- Um, a teddy bear.
- Wow, that's pretty radical,
Shana.
Harper's going
in a whole different direction-
- It's more complicated
than you think.
It's a good essay.
- Oh, I'm sure it is.
- Maybe you could critique it.
You're good at that, right?
- So who else
is gonna get lubed?
- We don't drink.
- Oh.
- But please, feel free.
Chris?
- Uh, no, thanks.
I'll take a water, though.
- Glass of water, Shana.
- So what do you do, Joe?
- I work at the oil refinery.
I'm a systems manager.
And you?
- I'm in TV.
I'm an editor.
Yeah, right now,
I'm working on a show
about the long-term
psychological effects
of disaster.
- Okay.
- Oh.
- So you guys want to watch
the game here tonight?
- Oh, no,
thank you.
- No?
You don't like baseball?
- It's okay, I guess.
- Chris?
- Well, yeah, sure.
Maybe a couple innings.
Why not?
- How long have you two
been friends?
- About a year.
- Yeah, we're coming up
on our first anniversary.
- That's right.
- Would you mind
if we prayed for you both?
- No.
- Lord, thank you
for this wonderful meal,
and thank you for bringing
these two men into our lives.
And please grant them
the strength to fight
what is abominable in your eyes,
for we are all sinners.
Amen.
- Amen.
-
And what exactly is it
that you find so abominable
about us, Joe?
- Well, it's not my judgment,
Gavin.
It's God's.
- Well, I hope God's a good shot
with those lightning bolts,
or one of us is gonna get
wrongfully struck.
Well, thank you for dinner.
- He has very strong beliefs.
- So do we, Chris.
You know, there are programs
that can help you.
- Joe.
- I can-
- That's enough.
- Hey, you know what?
Honestly, Joe,
I think if you knew
all the facts,
you wouldn't want me
on your team.
Okay?
Thank you.
- Let me show you out.
- Well, we're here
if you change your mind.
- I'm sorry.
- Un-fucking-believable.
I mean,
what a hateful fucking pair.
The food wasn't even that good.
And you know what pisses me off
most of all?
Is that you buy into
his horse shit in your own way.
- They don't talk about that
stuff at the Kabbalah center.
It's never an issue.
- Oh, read the damn book, Chris.
It says right in the Torah,
"If a man lies with a man
as one lies with a woman,
"both have done
what is detestable
and shall be put to death."
Jesus Christ,
I let them hold my hands
and pray for me.
- I don't think she's that bad.
She apologized when I left.
- Did she?
- "The object
that's most sacred to me
"is a small fluffy bear
my dad gave me when I was nine.
"He left when I was ten,
and I haven't seen him since.
"I try not to blame him
for what he did
"and remember that he loved me.
"At least he did then,
"because he told me so
with tears in his eyes.
"I guess he knew he was leaving
"and this was
his good-bye present.
"It is sacred to me
because it represents
my capacity to forgive."
-
- Good job.
How many beds
you get done in a day?
One?
Two?
- I get my work done.
- Just making a bed
in our own little room.
It's okay to laugh, you know.
It's in the employee manual.
In fact, it says when
the management makes a joke,
you have to laugh.
- Ha-ha.
- Actually, I just came by to
thank you for dinner last night.
- Yeah, I'm sorry about that.
- What are you sorry about?
- The gay thing.
- I'd like to say I'm sorry
I reacted the way I did,
but I'm not,
so I won't.
I read your essay.
It's pretty good.
You want to grab lunch
and talk about it?
I'll promote you
to room service.
- How corrupt you are.
- All right,
forget about it.
I'll see you later.
- I'd like to.
It's just one of the maids here
goes to the same church
as me and Joe.
- I'm inviting you to lunch,
Shana, not to a hotel.
In fact, we'd actually be
leaving a hotel.
You'd be a lot safer.
- He was a truck driver, my dad.
He had this huge red truck.
He was gone a lot,
and then he'd come back,
and me and my mom
would be waiting for him.
And the first thing
he'd always do
was find fault in something.
You know, like he had
to remind us who was boss.
- Did he hit you?
- Yeah.
Both of us.
But I don't think
he could help it.
- Maybe he left
'cause he was scared
he'd really hurt you
one day.
- I'd like to think so.
- Want a beer?
- Beer at lunch?
Quite the role model, Boss.
- You never drink?
- Almost never.
- You want to make an exception?
- Why would I?
- I don't know.
'Cause it might be fun.
-
Well, in that case...
You got an opener?
- It's not a twist-off?
- It's okay.
- Holy shit.
Note to self:
Decline blowjob if offered.
- Oh, my God.
So your friend Chris,
he's into that Kabbalah thing?
- Yeah.
- What's it about?
- I have no idea.
Some new age crap like,
E.G.O., ego:
Everyone's Got One.
It's a total crock of shit.
- Wow, you're kind of
an angry person, aren't you?
- Me?
How can you not be?
I mean, take this homophobia
crap, for example.
If I was in charge
of this country,
I'd ban heterosexual marriage.
- What?
Why?
- 'Cause heteros breed too much.
Gay men tend to adopt.
In an overcrowded world,
why would any reasonable person
discourage them in any way?
- Hmm.
I better get back to work.
Want my beer?
- Sure.
- Thanks for lunch.
- Jesus Christ, Gavin.
What the hell's
the matter with you?
I'll tell you
what's the matter with me.
The minute Joe started off
on that homophobic
biblical bullshit,
I decided to liberate his wife.
I was thinking of it as, like,
a Operation Rescue
type of thing.
I mean, come on,
what's a woman like that
doing with a man like him?
- Excuse me.
- Daddy!
- What are you doing back?
- I forgot something.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
Why don't you all
get to your bus
before you're late for school?
- Hi.
Is everything okay?
- No.
Come inside.
- Hollis, what's wrong?
Tell me.
- Whose kids are these?
Whose kids are these?
I'm asking you
whose kids they are!
Will you just tell me
how you can let me,
for all these years,
go around thinking
these are my damn kids
and I can't have any!
Whose kids are these?
Tell me!
- This is not what you think.
- What am I supposed to think?
Yea, though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death,
I will fear no evil.
Hey, forgive me.
- You okay?
- Yeah, now,
don't worry about me.
All right, then,
where were we?
- Oh, whoa.
- Excuse me.
- Morning.
- Mornin'.
- Hey, Gavin.
Sorry about the other night.
Thought you were gay.
- Hey, I'm a nonbeliever.
You can hate me
for that instead.
- Well, I don't hate gay people,
Gavin.
- Love the sinner,
hate the sin?
- Absolutely.
You know, if your friend
doesn't correct his ways,
he's going to hell.
And I'd do anything
to avoid that, Gavin,
because hell's a reality.
- Well, I'm late,
so maybe you can tell me
how you know this
some other time, okay?
I mean, have you been to hell?
Ever met anyone who's-
- How about Wednesday night?
- Hell and homos,
Wednesday night?
- And philosophy.
Salvation.
- Look, I got to go,
or I'm gonna miss my bus-
- Hey, you know,
don't be so close-minded.
- Are you willing to admit
that God might not exist?
- No.
- So who's being
close-minded here?
- Maybe you can change my mind.
- Okay.
Philosophy, Wednesday night.
- There you go.
- Sure.
- So how's the gay lifestyle
treating you?
- Fine.
How's the hetero lifestyle
treating you?
- You ever been married?
- Yeah.
But something tells me
the problems I had
are not the problems
you're having.
- What do you think
the problems I'm having are?
- Appreciating
someone's kindness
isn't necessarily the same thing
as being in love.
- Man, you have a big mouth.
- Sorry.
- Have you ever seen
a happy marriage?
I mean, really happy?
- I have to say,
for the first few years of my
marriage, I was very happy.
- And what happened?
- And then she left me.
- When was this?
- Two years ago.
- Boy, you sure take your time
to recover, don't you?
- You know what, Shana?
You're right.
Way too long.
But if you do
the charitable thing here
and start having sex with me
on a regular basis,
pretty sure
I'd start healing right away.
You have a very sexy mouth.
- A very sexy married mouth.
- That's right.
I forgot.
You see, the trick,
I figured,
having been on the receiving end
of such a thing,
was just to open the door.
After that, if she had
the slightest interest,
well, next time
her husband's cold to her,
couple of thoughts blow in.
Pretty soon, what blows in
is more than just nice.
It's perfect.
I mean, why wouldn't it be?
It's in her head.
She thinks, "What's the harm
in just thinking about this
if it makes me feel good?"
And then it's,
"Well, what's the harm
in just thinking about this
and coming?"
And so she comes.
Well, that takes care of that.
- Here we go.
- Thank you.
- What a relief.
Never again.
- The cantaloupe looks great.
- Trouble is,
a connection's been made.
She remembers it vividly.
I kissed her lips.
I was inside her.
Maybe I even said I loved her.
- Hey.
- Hi.
- So look what we got
from a single remark.
Now we add in something else.
Look, I'm embarrassed.
What I said the other day
was totally out of line.
I'm really sorry, okay?
- It's okay.
- It's not, really.
I've never done that before
with an employee,
and I won't do it again, okay?
- You're forgiven.
- Abandonment-
clearly a big issue for her.
"What, I haven't even had
the guy for real,
and now he's slamming the door
in my face?"
I know.
But don't hate me yet,
trust me.
I got mine coming.
- Now, let me ask you.
You ever look around
and the world just seems
empty to you?
- Oh, yeah.
- Has it ever occurred to you
that maybe
it's because
you don't have God in your life?
- No.
- Never?
- Look, Joe, when I was a kid,
I totally believed in God.
But, you know, you grow up.
Well, I did.
I looked around.
I said,
"Santa Claus: No evidence.
"The tooth fairy: No evidence.
"God, the same thing:
No evidence."
And then you think,
"Hmm.
I wonder if I really need
all these imaginary friends."
- So you think God's
just a pleasant thing?
Like it's easier
to believe than not?
- Well, easier for you, clearly.
- No, Gavin, faith is hard.
God tests you
time and time again.
Sometimes He even demands
that you die for Him.
You think that's easy?
- For people of faith, sure.
That's the problem.
Like, I could never fly
a jet into a building.
But those 9/11 guys could
'cause they had faith
in an afterlife,
not to mention 72 virgins,
though why anyone would want
virgins, I don't know.
- What did God do to you
to make you so angry at Him?
Look at the world
that He created,
all the beauty.
- Wars and plagues
and genocides
and earthquakes and tidal waves.
And then,
after all that suffering,
what does your God do next?
He sends most of us to hell.
- Well, not if you've
been born again.
- Right, the old
baptismal Jacuzzi.
- You have to accept
Jesus Christ
as your Lord and Savior.
That is your only
entrance requirement.
- Okay, so the Hebes,
the Hindus,
the Muslims, the atheists,
the Buddhists,
all damned, right?
- They have to accept
Jesus Christ.
- And the Catholics,
'cause they're not
born again, right?
- Right.
- Face it, man,
it's kind of crazy.
- No, it's not crazy.
God gives us free will
for that purpose.
Otherwise,
we would just be puppets.
Life would be...
Life would be meaningless.
That's the beauty
of eternal salvation.
You see, anyone can go
to heaven or hell,
because anyone can be saved.
It's your choice.
- Unless you're a kid in China
who gets hit by a bus
and never even heard
of this getting saved deal.
Where's his choice?
- Well, that's why
it's so important
to spread the gospel,
try and save people.
- I'm sorry.
I don't mean to laugh.
I just find this kind
of fundamentalism incredible.
I mean, all of you,
totally convinced
you know exactly who God is
and exactly how He wants
to be worshipped
and all without a lick
of evidence He even exists.
-
- No wonder
there are so many holy wars.
Without evidence, how else
would you win this argument
except by killing each other?
- See, I see evidence
in all kinds of things.
- So do they.
And sooner or later,
one of these guys
who hears God in his head
is gonna get ahold
of weapons of mass destruction,
and then,
when it's way too late,
we're finally
gonna ask ourselves,
"Why, after thousands of years
of bloodshed,
"didn't we at least try
to do away
"with this insane concept
of faith
before it fucking killed us?"
- You know,
maybe I'm just coming at this
from a different angle.
- And what angle would that be?
- Well, it's not abstract to me.
I go to the hospital,
and I visit
sick children, right?
Two days ago, I was
at the bedside of a dying child.
His mother and father
were killed in an auto accident.
He's about to pass as well.
And he asks me
if heaven really exists.
I say, "Yes, it does.
It's where Mommy and Daddy are."
About an hour or so later,
he dies
with a smile on his face.
So what would you have said
in my place-
"Sorry, kid,
no evidence"?
- No.
I probably would have told him
exactly the same lie you did.
But, Joe,
I'll tell you one thing
I damned sure
wouldn't have said,
and that's, "I'm sorry kid.
You're going to hell
if you haven't been baptized."
- Lord, forgive this man for his
hard heart and his blasphemy.
I think he has suffered
much more than he knows,
and he needs your love
and support now more than ever-
- No!
Joe, I'm sorry,
but you don't know
a damned thing about me,
and I don't need your help
or your salvation
or any other fucking bullshit
you may have to offer.
- Don't swear
in front of my wife!
- Gavin,
I think you should leave.
- With pleasure.
- Why can't you
leave people alone?
- Don't you dare
talk to me.
You get out of my sight.
- What the hell are you doing,
Chris?
- It's blessed water
from the temple.
- And how much
did you pay for that?
- I'm not going to tell you.
- I'm surrounded by imbeciles.
- Hi, I'm Frank.
I met Chris at temple.
- Hmm.
Hey.
- Can we meet
where we met before?
- Sure.
- When I was 18,
I got into drugs
and then into harder drugs,
and then I couldn't
afford them anymore.
And then I met a pimp.
And one night,
he sent me to see this john
who liked to do it in church.
But what he didn't tell me
was that the guy liked to beat
the girl when he was done.
I woke up in the morning,
and I couldn't even walk.
I didn't know what to do.
So I started to crawl
towards the altar
to see if there was something
I could steal.
But I didn't realize
it was Sunday morning,
and I got caught.
That was the day I met Joe.
And he took me to the hospital,
and he stayed with me.
If it weren't for him,
I don't think I'd be alive
right now.
He was the first man
who ever saw
something better in me
than what I was.
Joe takes care of me.
- You don't need anyone
to take care of you, Shana.
You're a strong,
intelligent woman.
- Yeah.
Will you do me a favor
and stay away from my husband?
Please?
- I'll do whatever you want.
- Believe it or not,
you actually got through to him.
- Really?
- He's decided we need
to be more evangelical.
We're going to a new church.
They do missionary work
in Uganda.
- What else?
- They're against smoking
and drinking,
immodest dress for women,
and secular music.
- Pfft.
Jesus Christ.
Restrings your guitar one day,
stops you from playing it
the next.
- You're so flippant,
aren't you?
You have no idea
what it's like
to lose everything
and to try and put it all
back together again.
- Actually, Shana-
- You don't know
what it's like for me and Joe.
-
I'm sorry.
I really didn't mean
to cause you problems.
I'm a fuckin' moron.
- Not even a little smirk,
Gavin?
- I think I made a big mistake.
You're so beautiful.
- You're pretty cute yourself.
That's why I'm gonna ask you
to stay away from me too.
Don't make this hard for me,
okay?
- Fuck.
- She said stay away, huh?
Guess you didn't listen.
- No, I did.
I stayed away
for, like, three weeks.
-
- Consuela, what's wrong?
- My father died.
Please let him into heaven.
You ask, too, Gavin.
- Please let Consuela's father
into heaven.
He must've been a good man,
or Consuela would not be
such a good woman.
I'm so sorry, Consuela.
Getting serious, huh?
- He's a nice guy.
We have a lot in common.
- Is the rabbi gonna marry you?
- Don't provoke me.
- Sorry.
- Look, as it happens,
we're gonna ask,
just hypothetically.
We have an appointment.
- Good luck.
- Since when do you smoke?
- I don't smoke.
- Mind if I join you?
- Not at all.
- Can I have a drag of that?
- You sure?
- Don't you start.
I was on my way to the store.
Got kind of claustrophobic.
- Things not so good, huh?
- Yeah.
Not so good.
- I'm sorry.
- You know what the problem is?
When I was doing
what I was doing,
I enjoyed it
in a sick kind of way.
I really liked getting high.
It was a relief.
But it was killing me,
and Joe showed me something
better that wouldn't kill me.
- What?
What did he show you?
- How to be at peace
by being in touch with
something bigger than myself.
- I got that for you.
Come on.
Lie down over here.
- That's not exactly
what I had in mind.
- Come on. Trust me.
Lie down.
There you have it.
- What?
- The universe.
I mean, look at it.
It's incredible.
You know, some of the stars
you can see on a clear night,
their light,
it's taken 21/2 million years
to get here.
When that light started out,
the Ice Age hadn't even begun.
When you want a connection
to something bigger,
how much bigger can you get
than this?
- It's pretty big.
- Yeah.
And we're a part of it,
a lucky part of it,
'cause as far as we know,
only Earth came together
in a way
that enabled life to exist.
I mean, what a break, right?
Thank you, universe.
And then you die, and that's it.
- Oh, now I'm definitely
feeling better.
- You should.
Once you understand
that life is finite,
you don't want to waste
a moment of it.
- I hate to say it,
but I'm not getting
the same buzz I get from church.
- Why not?
- 'Cause I want someone up there
I can talk to.
- That's what I thought, see?
You don't want a spiritual life
based on truth.
You want a daddy in the sky,
and even if he is
totally imaginary,
he's always gonna be there
when you need him.
- What I want is to be loved.
- I'm sorry.
- We thank you, Lord,
for your love and salvation,
but we are afraid.
If you call us
to do your work in Uganda,
please give us courage.
And also, Lord,
please give us the strength
to resist temptation,
for sometimes we are
sorely tried in this evil world.
Amen.
- Amen.
- I don't think I've ever loved
anyone before you.
Now I'm not even sure
I could live without you.
- Joe.
- But if we are to be laborers
together with God,
then we have to answer
when He calls.
- What about my education?
- Is that what this is about,
Shana?
Really?
- Yes.
- I don't want us to live
a small life, Shana.
- Yup?
Hold on!
Here.
Call me.
- Who's Exley?
- Oh, he used to work here.
- I have to go to school.
- Hold on!
- I'll call you
as soon as I can.
- Okay.
Here.
Hello?
- Tonight around 8:00?
- Yes.
- Where?
- The hotel.
I'll find a room and email you.
- You really put
some thought into this, huh?
- Yeah.
- So did I.
- When do you reckon
you'll get back?
- I'm just filling in
for someone.
I don't know
when they'll show up.
- Okay.
- Hi.
- Want a drink?
- I think I need one.
Are all these flowers for me?
- Stole 'em from the ballroom.
- Wedding?
- Memorial service.
You don't have to do it.
Let me undress you.
You're perfect.
-  Years float away
on the wind
Give me this day I can win
Give me your hands
to forget
Everything
You know the feeling
when your heart walked in
And you remember
why you kiss first, stare
She remembers all the good
up there that I've done
But I found
you're like a ghost of me
Like a secret sea,
you were stealing me
Mm
And it feels like
I'm remembering
Years float away
on the wind
Give me a moment to win
Give me your lips to forget
Everything,
everything
Years float away
on the wind
Give me this day
Give me your hands
to forget
Everything
- Oh, my God.
- You have a job.
You have God.
I am washed, sanctified,
and justified.
Help me.
Help Shana.
- When I got home last night,
he wasn't there.
Then he came back,
and I asked him where he'd been,
and he said, "Thinking.
Where have you been?"
- Then what?
- And then this morning,
he was distant,
and then he just went to work.
- Why don't you leave him?
I mean it.
- I'm afraid of what
he might do to himself.
- Like what?
- I don't know.
I feel scared of him,
and I feel sorry for him
and grateful and ashamed.
But at the same time,
it's-
I sort of can't even think
about him.
It's like he's disappearing.
All I can think about is you.
- I feel the same way.
I didn't sleep at all
last night.
- Really?
Could we see each other again
tonight?
- How would you get out?
- He's going
to some church thing
from 7:00 to 10:00.
- Chris too.
Finally something
to thank God for.
- I'm sorry.
- Take it.
I'll wait.
- What do you want?
- Hey.
I just wanted
to give you a family.
- What makes you think
I want to talk about this now?
- Hollis, it was
just an arrangement.
That's all.
Hollis, I was just afraid
of losing you, so I just-
- I'm up here on the ledge
with somebody and-
- Please, Hollis.
I love you.
- I cannot have
this conversation right now.
- I love you.
I love you more
than anything in life.
- Look, I got to go.
- You have to go?
- No, no, no, no.
I'm good.
So what happened next?
- Well, I better be going.
- Okay.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- I want to do it here.
- Okay.
- Take my panties off.
Oh, my...
I love the way you touch me.
- Who is that?
- That's my daughter.
- You have a daughter?
- I had a daughter.
- What happened?
- She died two years ago.
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- I'm sure she's up in heaven
with all the other
little baby angels.
I'm sorry.
I don't mean to be
such an asshole.
I really don't.
I was driving her
to school one day.
And we'd had a fight.
The radio was on.
There was a song
we both really liked.
She was singing along.
I was watching her
in the mirror,
and I was just about to tell her
that it was all okay,
and then a truck
swerved from traffic
from the opposite direction,
and I had less than a second
to think.
And I don't know if it was
instinct or a bad guess
or maybe self-preservation,
but...
I swung the wheel
the wrong way,
and the truck hit her side
of the car.
And five minutes later,
she's dead.
My wife never blamed me,
exactly.
It was-the truck driver
had a heart attack.
It wasn't my fault, but...
It was in her eyes.
I needed her to forgive me,
and she couldn't do it.
And so we split up,
and I totally fell apart.
And then I got a job
in the hospitality industry.
And now I'm just dandy.
- Oh!
Uh, I thought you were out.
I was gonna get a sip
of your whiskey.
We-
- You ever think of knocking?
- Excuse us.
Sorry.
- What happened?
- Uh, you were right.
Turns out this center
is a little more conservative
than we thought.
- Light gets switched off
before it reaches the homos?
- Not exactly.
Dimmed.
- Sorry.
Really.
- Hey.
To the grave, okay?
- Oh.
- It's okay.
He's cool.
Both of them.
- You know,
if you and I
could ever be together,
I think we'd be really happy.
- Strange thing is,
I felt the same way.
I had to make a game of it
at the start...
'cause I wasn't really up
for it, you know?
Love.
- No wonder.
- I guess
it's always inexplicable
why you fall in love, isn't it?
I mean, you tell me,
why do you love your wife?
- To be honest with you,
Gavin,
I don't think I do anymore.
As a matter of fact,
I don't even think
I'm going home tonight.
- Why not?
- She cheated on me.
I kind of lost
both of my kids today.
My little boy and my girl,
you know.
Found out neither one of 'em
was mine this morning.
- Why?
- 'Cause I'm sterile.
I just found out.
I've always been.
- Did you want kids?
- Like you wouldn't believe,
you know?
I mean, we tried and tried
for years,
and when nothing happened,
eventually we went over
to the clinic,
and we got tested.
And I never bothered
to go and get the results.
But she did.
And when she told me
everything was okay, I was...
And then nine months later, we-
She said that she was afraid
she was going to lose me
and that it was just
an arrangement.
- Who's the father?
- She wanted the kids to look
as much like me as possible.
I got a younger brother, man.
Look, I'm sorry,
Gavin,
but please don't make my day
any worse than it already is.
Why don't you just
come on in here?
- Believe me,
if I could, I would.
- Hollis.
- Excuse me.
- Spoke to the roommate, Chris.
He says he thinks Joe's capable
ofjust about anything.
Shana never made it to school.
Joe never showed up for work.
I've been trying both
their numbers.
I got nothing.
- Please, keep calling them.
- All right.
How's he doin'?
- Do I think he might do it?
I think he could.
- All right.
Are you good?
- I'm having a rough day.
Hey, forgive me.
- Look man, the point is,
you got kids,
even if it wasn't exactly
how you wanted.
- Let's just go on
with your story, okay?
- Okay.
We decided to tell Joe
the truth.
But Shana wanted to speak
to the pastor first
'cause she was so scared
he'd kill himself.
- I know I haven't been
an exciting lover for you.
I know that I have been
too dominating
in a way
that wasn't interesting.
But I wasn't always like this.
I know how bad things are.
I just want one night.
Borrow an apartment.
Go to a hotel.
A night away from
what we're supposed to be,
a night to prove I can
make you happy that way.
Don't I at least deserve that?
- I have to get out of this
the right way.
I owe him so much.
- I know.
I know, and I know
I have no right, but...
- We only have to get through
a couple more days, okay?
Okay?
- Okay.
- I should go.
I'm doing the night shift,
and then I'm gonna go see
the pastor in the morning.
- Come by after.
Let me know how it went.
- I love you.
- Crescent Riverview.
- Hi.
I'd like a room, please.
- When would it be for?
- Tonight, if you've got one.
Come on in.
Would you mind if we talked?
- Oh-
- Please, it's important.
Sit down.
You know what the difference is
between you and me, Gavin?
- No.
- There are two differences.
First of all, you don't see
the world as it is.
This world
is a disgusting place.
I know this because I've seen
some of the worst
it has to offer.
- I find that hard to believe.
- Did you know
I was married before?
- No, I didn't know that, Joe.
- Mm-hmm.
A lovely wife,
two beautiful children,
great home.
But I couldn't stay home,
because I was drawn to sin.
I'd go out for a drink,
and five hours later,
I'd be coked out of my head
and in a booth in a porno shop,
or I'd get a hooker,
or I'd go-go gambling,
or pretty much whatever
you can imagine, I did.
And I lost it all.
My wife left me.
She caught diseases from me.
I lost my job.
I lost my children.
But even still, I couldn't stop.
I mean, so what do you think
that is?
You think
I'm, like, a sex addict
or a junkie
or a gambling addict,
alcoholic?
What?
- I don't know, Joe.
I have no idea.
- The answer
is none of the above.
I just had to have sensation.
I had to feel alive,
because inside, I was dying.
Spiritually, right?
I was lost.
See, I was, you know,
half an inch from death
when Jesus came to me.
I was.
I was lying in the gutter
and got up,
stumbled into a church,
and I was born again.
I was saved.
I was a new man.
The joy-the relief, really...
You have no idea how that feels.
About a year later,
the Lord, having given me
so much already,
He gave me Shana.
He brought her into the church.
And the moment that I saw her,
I knew that I loved her.
Then we were married
in His sight,
in His house.
And loving her was the-
It was such a pure love.
Until two nights ago.
When you were...
fucking her in your kitchen,
I was outside the door,
listening.
And I thought
of smashing down that door
and killing you both.
But I just ran away.
I ran away, and I did things
that I have not done
in a long time.
And when I came home,
she was asleep in there.
And I watched her lying there.
And she was smiling.
It's hard when we lose
someone we love,
isn't it?
- Yes, it is.
- So I came in here,
and I opened up the Bible.
And I read Psalm 23.
"The Lord is my shepherd.
I shall not want.
"Yea, though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death,
"I will fear no evil,
for thou art with me.
Thy rod and thy staff,
they comfort me."
And I took this gun,
and I put it right here.
Now...
You think I'm still here
because I was afraid?
- I don't know, Joe.
- No.
I have no fear, Gavin.
You ever been
totally without fear?
- No.
- That's the second difference
between us.
I have the courage
to die for my beliefs
because I know where I'm going.
You have the courage
to die for your beliefs?
- I guess so, you know,
if I had to.
- I don't think you do.
But I figured out
I was the last person
that should die.
- Joe.
-
Read the marked passage.
- "The man
that committeth adultery
"with another man's wife,
the adulterer and the adulteress
shall surely be put to death."
But, Joe,
what about the New Testament?
Doesn't Jesus say
about an adulteress,
"He who is without sin
amongst you,
let him cast a stone at her?"
- That's right, and no one did,
because no one was without sin.
And Jesus said to the woman,
"Neither do I condemn thee.
Now go and sin no more."
- Right.
- Are you prepared
to sin no more?
Is Shana?
I am washed, sanctified,
and justified.
And if I say
I'm gonna do something,
you better believe I will.
Get out.
- Listen, Gavin.
For God's sake,
just come in here.
I promise I can help you.
- You think I want this, man?
- We just got five minutes left.
Please let me...
Excuse me.
If you were gonna kill someone
that had an affair
with your wife
and you were doing it this way,
what would you want?
- Gavin!
Get down from there, man!
- I'd want to watch him.
- Me too.
I think I just saw something
on the ninth floor
at the Crescent Hotel.
- What are you doing?
- Look, for God's sake, Gavin,
please just come in here.
Let me help you.
- There's nothing you can do.
- Hi. This is Shana.
Please leave a message.
Beep!
- Fuck.
Shana.
- You know how I said
I had the courage
to die for my beliefs
but you didn't?
- Yeah.
- You disagreed.
- Yeah.
- You still think you have
the courage?
- Yeah, Joe,
but what does that matter?
- Yeah, will let me tell you
what the situation is here,
Gavin.
See, I've decided I'm more
of an Old Testament sort of guy.
But I am willing to compromise.
Only one of you
has to die today.
I have Shana
right in front of me,
and I have my gun
pointed at her head.
- Listen, Joe, whatever-
- Stop.
Stop.
Go to the Tamlacker Building.
There's a door around back.
Take the staircase
all the way up to the top.
On the roof,
you'll find a utility shed.
You get on the ledge
in front of it.
You stand there and think.
At noon, you jump,
or I put a bullet in her head.
Maybe you'll find God.
- What in the hell
is wrong with you?
Don't you realize if you had
told me this from the start,
I could've found him?
I could've done something.
- He would've killed her.
- How do you know he's even
capable of killing her?
You don't even know
what you're capable of.
I mean, would you kill your mom
in order to save your father
or kill one of your kids
in order to save another kid?
These are things
that we cannot know.
- I know what he's capable of,
Hollis.
I saw it in his eyes.
- Look, man, I am not gonna
blow smoke up your ass.
You are in a terrible dilemma.
But I swear to you,
if I was in your place-
- Who do your kids
think their dad is?
- Gavin-
- You get over it for them.
- Gavin, please.
Please just come in here-
- Where's your faith now?
Your wife says she loves you
and she did this for you, right?
- Why can't you have faith
in that?
- Why don't you just mind
your own fuckin' business?
Listen, man,
if you do this to me,
I'm gonna carry this shit
the rest of my life.
- Not if you do
what I want you to do.
- Tell Shana-
- I will not do it.
I will not do it.
If you got somethin'
that you need to tell her,
you climb your ass in here,
you tell her yourself!
You're always so rational.
I mean, does this sound
rational to you?
- Whoa! Get out of here!
- I mean, think about it.
What makes her life
more valuable than yours?
Please.
Gavin.
Just come here.
Just come here, man.
Now, Gavin, please.
Gavin, please come here.
Just come here, man.
- Look, I feel like
I've gotten to know you.
And I like you, and I'm sorry
I'm gonna have to do this.
- Please.
- But if you were standing
where I am
and your wife or any one
of your kids had a gun
to his or her head,
this time,
you did have time to think,
could anyone on Earth
stop you from jumping?
- I'm begging you.
Please don't do this.
- Here's what I want you to do.
- Gavin, please don't do this.
- I never told Shana
I loved her.
You tell her for me.
- I will not do it.
- Yes, you will.
Then you go home, okay?
- Gavin, don't you do this.
Please, Gavin.
- Fuck.
Here.
- Gavin, please!
- Freeze.
Freeze!
On the ground, now.
Drop it.
- Do you have anyone
to stay with?
- I think I'll try being alone
for a while.
Never really done that.
- Well, at least for tonight,
like, a friend?
- I guess I'll find out.
- Look, not that I imagine
you're doubting it,
but he did want me
to tell you that...
he loved you.
- Thank you.
Both:
Daddy!
- They heard
what happened today.
The guy on the-
- It was on the TV?
- I'm really sorry.
- It's okay.
Life goes on.
- So shall we say grace?
- No, not tonight.
We don't say grace tonight,
okay?
- Why not?
- Because I'm your father,
and I said so, okay?
- Okay.
- Okay?
- Okay.
- Let's eat.
- Hey, will you pass me
the bread, Junior?
-  Thank you for this day
We walked downtown
in our heavy coats
She held my hand
And pulled me through
The crowds
I watched her smile
As the sun burst through
The clouds
Is there still love
In this heart
Is there still love
In this heart
Thank you for this dream
Though everything feels real
Waking up
Pale and shattered
In her arms
Heavy rain
Bouncing through
her bamboo blinds
Is there still love
In this heart
Is there still love
In this heart
If I had a message
For the universe
She asked,
"What would it be?"
If I had a message
For the universe
She asked,
"What would it be?"
Thank you
