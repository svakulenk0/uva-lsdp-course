Resync by
First Ranger, you have
command of Castle Black.
Lord Commander,
it is my duty to tell you
I believe this mission
to be reckless, foolhardy,
and an insult
to all the brothers
who have died
fighting the wildlings.
As always, thank you
for your honesty.
Safe travels, Lord Commander.
Thank you, Sam.
Oh, um...
It's dragonglass.
It's what I used
to kill the white walker.
I hope you don't need them.
Me, too.
Yah.
There he is.
That laugh.
One of the first things
I remember.
His little brother Aegon.
He became king.
And before that,
he was a jolly fellow,
like this one.
Get him south, Gillyflower.
Before it's too late.
Theon, wait.
Not Theon, my lady.
Reek.
Help me.
You're his wife now.
Theon.
Do what he says.
Do what he says
or he'll hurt you.
He already hurts me every night.
All day I'm locked in this room
and every night he comes...
It can't be any worse.
It can.
It can always be worse.
- What did he do to you?
- Please.
- You betrayed my family!
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
You have to help me.
Theon, help me.
He'll see us.
You don't know him.
My family still has
friends in the North.
All I need to do is give a
signal and they'll rescue me.
Climb to the top
of the broken tower.
Light this candle
and put it in the window.
- Promise me, Theon.
- Reek! My name is Reek.
Your name is Theon Greyjoy.
Last surviving son
of Balon Greyjoy,
Lord of the Iron Islands.
Do you hear me?
Theon...
promise me.
Yes, Reek?
Egg.
Mother's looking for you.
Egg.
Get some sleep, Sam.
You'll have to speak
for him tomorrow.
You don't know that.
Get some sleep.
I'll watch over him.
I'm staying, too.
He's always been good to me.
I can't leave him now.
Egg!
Egg.
I dreamed...
that I was old.
His name
was Aemon Targaryen.
He came to us
from King's Landing.
A maester of the Citadel,
chained and sworn,
and sworn brother of the
Night's Watch, ever faithful.
At the Wall,
a dozen lord commanders
came and went during
his years of service,
but he was always there
to counsel them.
He was the blood
of the dragon...
but now his fire has gone out.
And now his watch is ended.
And now his watch is ended.
You're losing
all your friends, Tarly.
My beautiful wife.
When my father told me
we were marrying,
I half expected
a fat, bearded beast.
Do you know how pleased
I was when I saw you?
You've made me very happy.
Our scouts report that Stannis
Baratheon rides for Winterfell.
He's a respected commander.
His troops are loyal
and battle-tested.
He's hired thousands of foreign
sellswords to bolster his army.
But this storm is a stroke
of luck for us northerners.
Our people are used
to fighting in the frost.
His army is out there now
suffering in the snow.
One day I'll be
Lord of Winterfell
and Warden of the North.
You'll be my lady and Wardeness.
But isn't
your stepmother pregnant?
What of it?
What happens if she has a boy?
Then I'll have a baby brother.
But he'll be the heir.
I'm Lord Bolton's eldest son.
But you're a bastard.
A trueborn will always
have the stronger claim.
I've been naturalized
by a royal decree from...
Tommen Baratheon?
Another bastard.
Bastards can rise
high in the world.
Like your half-brother
Jon Snow.
Born the bastard of Winterfell,
now the Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch.
You didn't know?
Yes, he's done
very well for himself.
Oh.
I nearly forgot why
I asked you to join me.
Come, my lady.
Reek told me
you wanted to leave.
Why?
Winterfell is your home
and I am your husband.
Tough old bird.
Everyone talks
when I start peeling them.
But this one,
her heart gave out before
I even got to her face.
We do breed them tough
in the North.
Bring my wife
back to her chamber.
It's far too cold
out here for a lady.
You should hold on
to your candles.
The nights are so long now.
40 horses
died in the night.
We'll lose more come sunset.
We're running out of food.
We can't open the supply
line until the snow clears.
What else?
The Stormcrows
rode off last night.
Sellswords.
Loyal to nothing but gold.
We still have a hard
march to Winterfell
and we won't be marching
anywhere in this weather.
And?
This isn't our time.
We should head back to Castle
Black when the snow clears.
I retreated from
King's Landing, Ser Davos.
If I retreat again,
I'll become the King Who Ran.
- Your Grace...
- Winter is coming.
Those aren't just the Stark words.
It's a fact.
If we march
back to Castle Black,
we winter at Castle Black.
And who can say how many years
this winter will last?
It's better to wait for the right
time than risk everything.
This is the right time
and I will risk everything.
Because if I don't, we've lost.
We march to victory
or we march to defeat.
But we go forward.
Only forward.
Your Grace.
I've trusted in your visions
and your prophecies for years.
You saw it yourself, my king,
when you stared into the flames.
- I don't know what I saw.
-
Trust yourself.
And you?
Do you trust yourself?
I trust in the Lord.
Are you sure?
I have seen myself walk along
the battlements of Winterfell.
I have seen the flayed man
banners lowered to the ground.
But sometimes sacrifices must
be made to ensure victory.
I have shown you
the power of king's blood.
The usurper Robb Stark.
The usurper Joffrey Baratheon.
We don't have
Robert's bastard here.
No, we have someone better.
And your blood
runs through her veins.
Have you lost your mind?
Do you doubt me?
Still?
After all that you've seen.
There must be another way.
- Leeches or...
- There is only one way.
You must become king
before the Long Night begins.
Only you can lead
the living against the dead.
All your life has led us
to this moment.
- To this decision.
- She's my daughter.
Get out.
There's always
some sort of grub on.
A bit of mutton would be nice.
A beauty from beyond the Wall.
Where you going, love? Aren't we
better-looking than the fat man?
No, the question is is she pretty
down south in the real world
or is she pretty 'cause
she's the only girl here?
Even in White Harbor,
I'd want a kiss.
Come on, love, give us a kiss.
- Leave me alone. - Oh, if you were my girl,
I wouldn't leave you alone.
- One little kiss.
- Come on, give him a kiss.
A man gets lonely
guarding the Wall.
There's no need to be rude.
We just want a little affection.
Ooh.
Get your hands off her.
Brother Derek, Brother Brant,
I believe you both
have guard duty tonight.
Sam the Slayer.
You gonna slay me
with that sword?
Gilly, go on.
Get back to your room,
lock the door.
- I'm warning you.
- Come on.
Come on.
Sam!
You lying sack of shit.
You fat-ass fuck.
Come on, get up.
- No!
- This your hero? This hog?
Leave him alone!
Stubborn little wildling
bitch, aren't you?
- Come on!
- No!
- Sam! Sam! Sam!
- Come on!
- Sam! Sam!
- Come on.
- Turn her over.
- All right.
I said get your hands off her.
You're gonna
get yourself killed.
Your lover Jon Snow's
not here to save you.
I killed a white walker,
I killed a Thenn.
I'll take my chances with you.
- I'm all right.
- You're not.
Just a bit woozy.
The next time you see something
like that, you leave it alone.
I will not.
They would have...
I don't know what
they would have done.
I know they would have killed
you if Ghost hadn't come.
No. No, no.
They were tiring out.
I had them
in the palm of my hand.
Don't be stupid, Sam.
You're not a fighter.
What kind of man would I be
if I ran away when I saw
someone hurting you?
Just promise me
whatever happens, you'll
take care of Little Sam.
But of course I will.
And...
I'll take care of you, too.
I need more water.
Stay.
Am I hurting you?
Are you sure?
Oh, my!
A rare find for the
fighting pits, my friends.
Not your usual street tough
or drunken pirate.
This one's a Westerosi knight
from an ancient house
trained in sword and lance.
He fought beside
the stag king Robert
on the far side
of the Narrow Sea.
He was first through the breach
during the Siege of Spike,
slaughtering 50 men
with his flaming sword.
He killed the great Khal
Drogo in single combat.
Betrayed by his woman,
he sold himself into slavery
to repay his debts.
Do I have 14?
Do I hear 16?
Sold.
Wait! You have
to buy me as well.
Why?
We're a team.
I'm a great fighter, too.
He's funny.
You have to give him that.
You're right, he's funny.
Thank you, my lord.
Thank you.
Yes.
My lord, if I may.
I've heard Meereen
has become a free city.
You might run into trouble if you try
to fight slaves in the fighting pits.
Now, if you were to fight freed
men who'd be paid a wage...
There's your wages, funny man.
Should last the rest
of your life.
These are warrior
hands, not a serving girl's.
How long before the King of
Meereen comes to claim my pillow?
Don't be ridiculous.
My marriage to Hizdahr
is political.
I think he's smart enough
to understand that.
I think the Sons of the
Harpy have stopped killing
because their leader
was made king.
Are you jealous?
You think I'm petty enough
to speak ill of a man
just because he
represents competition?
I do.
You're right.
My motivations
are entirely impure.
Doesn't make me wrong.
You told me yourself I can't fight
enemies within and without.
So when enemies without
come knocking,
I need the city
of Meereen behind me.
I have no choice.
Everyone has a choice.
Even slaves
have a choice...
Death or slavery.
So what else can I do, hmm?
Marry me instead.
Even if I wanted to do
such an inadvisable thing,
I couldn't.
Why not?
You are queen.
You can do what you like.
No, I can't.
Then you are the only person
in Meereen who's not free.
And I know I'm here to serve
my queen and not give advice,
but can I make
one more suggestion?
Of course.
On the day of the great games,
gather all the Great
Masters and Wise Masters
and Worthy Masters you can find
and slaughter them all.
I am a queen, not a butcher.
All rulers are either
butchers or meat.
You there. Where would
I find the High Septon
or High Sparrow or whatever
bloody fool name he's got?
It's not as good a name as
Queen of Thorns, I'll admit.
You should have the decency
to stand when
you speak to a lady.
You should have the decency
to kneel before the gods.
Don't spar with me,
little fellow.
For me, it's the knees.
- You?
- Hips.
Ah.
A man of the people.
Is that your game?
It's an old game.
Dull and unconvincing.
A man of the people
who does Cersei's
dirty work for her.
The people always
do the dirty work.
Spare me the homilies. I can
smell a fraud from a mile away.
Useful talent.
I'm here for my grandson
and granddaughter.
Your grandson and granddaughter
swore sacred vows and lied.
The Father judges us all.
Sons of high lords,
sons of fishermen.
If you break his laws,
you will be punished.
Don't you walk away from me.
You don't give commands
here, Lady Olenna.
What is it you want?
Gold?
I'll make you the richest
septon who ever lived.
What, then?
I imagine this
is strange for you.
Everyone you meet
has a hidden motive
and you pride yourself
on sniffing it out.
But I'm telling you
a simple truth.
I serve the gods.
The gods demand justice.
How do they communicate
their demands?
By raven or horse?
By the holy text,
"The Seven-Pointed Star."
If you don't have one
in your library,
I've read
"The Seven-Pointed Star."
Then you'll remember the passages
concerning buggery and perjury.
Your grandchildren
will be punished
in the same manner as anyone
who breaks the sacred laws.
Half the men,
women, and children
in this foul city
break the sacred laws.
You live among murderers,
thieves, and rapists,
and yet you punish Loras
for shagging some perfumed ponce
and Margaery for defending
her brother?
Yes. The gods' laws must
be applied to all equally.
If it's equality
you want, so be it.
When House Tyrell stops sending
our crops to the capital,
everyone here will starve.
And I'll make sure the
hungry know who's to blame.
Have you ever sowed the
field, Lady Olenna?
Have you ever reaped the grain?
Has anyone in House Tyrell?
A lifetime of wealth and power
has left you blind in one eye.
You are the few,
we are the many.
And when the many
stop fearing the few...
Lady Olenna.
Starving yourself
won't make things
any better for her, my love.
She's in a prison cell
and there is nothing I can do.
I am the king!
The queen is in prison and
there is nothing I can do!
No matter who you are,
no matter how strong
you are, sooner or later,
you'll face circumstances
beyond your control.
Events you couldn't
possibly have anticipated
or prevented even if you had.
You cannot blame
yourself for fate.
Your father,
your brother,
your grandfather...
I was Queen of the Seven
Kingdoms and what could I do?
Hold them as they
left this world.
Kissed their heads
after they'd gone.
I'll call in the army.
I'll take back the sept
and kill every last one of them.
I'll start a war if I have to.
You know as well as I do who the
first casualty of that war would be.
I love her.
I love her...
and I can't help her.
We must be strong
for those we love.
We cannot give in to despair.
I will speak
with the High Sparrow.
There must be
something he...
Let me talk to him
on your behalf.
The king cannot sully himself
negotiating with an unwashed fanatic.
You will try to help her?
I'll do everything I can to win
her freedom and her brother's.
Your happiness is all
I want in this world.
- I know.
- No, you don't.
You can't possibly.
Not until you have
children of your own.
I would do anything for you.
Anything to keep you from harm.
I would burn cities
to the ground.
You are all that matters.
You and your sister.
From the moment you came
into this world.
My boy.
My only boy.
Prince Doran hopes
this satisfies
your concerns about the
princess's well-being.
You looked different
when I left.
You had more hair.
And more hands.
- How's Trystane?
- He'll be all right.
I'm sorry for that.
It wasn't supposed
to happen that way.
Why is it happening at all?
Your mother's worried about you.
Threats have been made.
Dorne's too dangerous for you.
- I've come to take you home.
- This is my home.
This has been my home for years.
I didn't want to come here,
but she told me to.
I did what she said.
I did my duty and now
she's forcing me to go back?
It's for your own good.
These are complicated matters.
No, it's not complicated at all.
It's simple.
I love Trystane,
I'm going to marry him,
and we're staying right here.
- I don't understand.
- Of course you don't.
You don't know me.
Brothers, O brothers,
my days here are done
The Dornishman's
taken my life
But what does it matter
For all men must die
And I've tasted
the Dornishman's wife
I have, I've tasted
the Dornishman's wife.
He's got a good voice.
We're lucky he's a singer.
If he were a fighter, we
might have been in trouble.
It's against my code
to hurt a woman.
It's amazing how many men we
beat seem to have this code.
I wouldn't say you beat me.
How's your arm?
Wonderful.
Wouldn't feel right to leave
Dorne without a new scar.
You think you're leaving Dorne?
No great hurry.
Dornish women are the most
beautiful women in the world.
Thank you.
I said Dornish women.
I didn't say you.
I'm not the most beautiful
woman you've ever seen?
I've seen
quite a few women
Name one more beautiful
than I am.
Well, now, in King's Landing,
there was an absolutely
gorgeous...
There was a what?
In King's Landing,
you were saying?
Was I?
There was a woman
more beautiful than I am.
Was there?
My memory's not
what it was earlier.
How's your arm now?
You seem concerned with it.
And how about your head?
My head?
You don't even want to
know what's going on in...
Your nose is bleeding.
It's nothing.
It's the dry air.
My dagger was coated with a
special ointment from Asshai.
It takes time to work,
but if a single drop
makes contact with the skin,
death.
The only antidote.
Who's the most beautiful
woman in the world?
You.
Sorry? Who?
You.
Don't drop it.
I think you're
very handsome as well.
- I'm sorry about the locale.
- No, you're not.
It felt like the safest place.
Not for your clientele, clearly.
It was an establishment
like no other.
The sheer range
of appetites catered to.
Desires that didn't even exist
until we invented them.
You've always been rather impressed
with yourself, haven't you?
The past is the past.
The future is all
that's worth discussing.
The future of House Tyrell.
Don't pretend to have
any concern for my house,
my grandchildren or me.
I should have known
you'd return to the capital
as soon as things
started to go wrong.
- I promise you...
- I promise you, Lord Baelish,
that our fates are joined.
Together we murdered a king.
If my house should fall,
I will have nothing to hide.
And if I should meet
with some accident
here at your broken
little flesh market,
they'll never even find
what's left of you.
So...
do you deny a part in all this?
Cersei summoned me
to King's Landing.
I dared not refuse her.
And what did she want?
A piece of information
she knew that I had.
Neither silence
nor lies were an option.
But I have other information
of which she is unaware.
And as you say,
our interests are aligned.
I have a gift for you.
What kind of gift?
The same kind I gave Cersei.
A handsome young man.
Many worthy
fighters have died
trying to make it
to the great games.
When most of you worthless scum
join them in death this afternoon,
it will represent a significant
rise in your station.
But if you do happen
to triumph here,
you will fight at the Great
Pit of Daznak itself
So whatever happens, the gods
have smiled upon you today.
This is the day your lives
actually start to mean something.
You and you.
You.
You two.
Up.
- Valar morghulis.
- Valar dohaeris.
Prepare yourselves.
Sitting through the great
games will be bad enough.
For generations in the days
leading up to the great games,
it has been customary
for our ruler
to make the rounds
of the lower pits
to pay the fighters there
the honor of her presence.
Your Grace.
Your future Grace.
You honor us all.
Stand there.
Stand straight.
That's the fucking queen.
We fight and
die for your glory,
O glorious queen.
We fight and
die for your glory,
I think I've seen enough.
Your Grace, it is a tradition
for the queen to stay
until the victor has emerged.
I've sacrificed more than
enough for your traditions.
What are you doing?
Wait your turn,
you piece of fucking filth.
Get him out of my sight.
Khaleesi, please.
I just need
a moment of your time.
I brought you a gift.
He has.
Who are you?
I am the gift.
It's a pleasure
to meet you, Your Grace.
My name is Tyrion Lannister.
This is horrible.
Unacceptable.
Are they feeding you
enough at least?
I brought you this.
Venison.
It's quite good.
I had it myself for supper
only last night.
We did everything we could from the
moment they took your brother.
Tommen even went
to the sept himself
to confront the High Sparrow.
But I fear the Faith
has left reason behind.
I know you did this.
We are making every effort
on your behalf.
I swear to you
by all the seven gods.
Lies come easily to you.
Everyone knows that.
you're not very good
at those, I'm afraid.
Perhaps that's why
your son was so eager
to cast you aside for me.
You're upset.
You're not thinking clearly.
I'll visit again when you've
had a chance to calm down.
I don't want to see you again.
I do hope you change
your mind about that.
I've been told men often go mad
in the Black Cells
beneath the Red Keep.
Though I suppose
your isolation will end
when your trial begins.
Leave.
Yes.
I'm afraid I must.
My son needs me now
more than ever.
Get out, you hateful bitch!
Sleep well, sister.
Thank you, Boake.
- You saw her?
- Yes.
- And?
- Her accommodations seem sufficient.
What happens to her now?
Well, she and her brother
are both being held
under fair suspicion.
A trial will be held
for each of them
to determine if they're
guilty of any acts
that might constitute a violation
of the tenets of the faith.
Who will stand judge?
Seven septons as it was in all
trials before the Targaryens.
Will you be one of them?
I will.
If one or both of them
were to confess
before the trial...
Then they will be shown
the Mother's mercy.
And what does
the Mother's mercy entail?
It depends upon the situation.
The acts themselves,
the degree of contrition.
Thank you, High Septon,
for bringing them whatever
justice they deserve
is one of the oldest
structures in King's Landing?
I think I may have
heard at one point.
Baelor built his sept around it.
But men worshipped here
long before him.
Who carved this altar?
- Do you know?
- I'm afraid I don't.
No one does.
There's no name on it or
anywhere else in the chapel.
No, the people
who built this place
didn't inflict their vanity
on those who came after them
the way Baelor did with that great
gilded monstrosity up there.
Hmm.
Their faith was clean.
Strip away the gold
and the ornaments,
knock down the statues
and the pillars,
and this is what remains.
Something simple...
and solid and true.
The Tyrells' finery
will be stripped away.
Their true hearts
laid bare for all to see.
And so it will be for all of us.
High and low alike.
What will we find
when we strip away your finery?
A young man came to us
not long ago.
Broken in body and spirit.
He had so much to strip away.
But piece by piece,
he unburdened himself.
pride, sin.
Now his soul is so light,
he will float through the
Seven Heavens like a bird.
Hmm.
And he has much
to say about you.
Move.
Let me go immediately.
You will order her to let me go.
I am the queen!
I am the queen!
Have you lost your mind?
Let me go!
I am the queen!
Let me go!
Look at me.
Look at my face.
It's the last thing
you'll see before you die.
