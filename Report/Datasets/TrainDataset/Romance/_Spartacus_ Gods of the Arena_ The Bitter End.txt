Buy passage far from Capua
and the things that
have been done to you.
I will see you again one day.
Go.
Dagan is now blind
to attack from the right.
I cannot stay within
these walls
You are champion now.
That is all that matters.
with a gift.
A more permanent solution
was required between us.
One that I added
to Tullius' gift.
I would share drink.
Quintus will not forgive
Tullius this
and Gaia's death
with be avenged.
warwerwor
It is a heavy thing...
Seeing a father,
so strong in life,
unable to rise.
The weight of it keenly felt.
Titus was much loved
by this city.
Hold comfort in the knowledge.
The magistrate himself
pays respect?
It's a great honor.
For my father.
Years I wished for
blistering tongue to cool.
Only to long for it
to scorch ear once more.
I know you did not wish
him gone in such a manner.
Nor did I,
despite our many differences.
Yet the gods have willed it.
The gods had no
fucking hand in this.
Tullius' alone inflicts injury.
And how shall it be answered?
Apologies.
Unwelcome guest
makes appearance.
Vettius.
Temper emotion, and greet him
with measured voice.
It would serve no purpose
to have confrontation here
in front of the Magistrate.
Good Batiatus.
My sympathy for
the passing of your father.
A titan, standing far
above all who follow.
You come absent Tullius?
I thought nothing
could keep the man
from observance
of such a tragedy.
He confers with dignitaries
from Antioch.
Antioch?
He is engaged
in business there,
to the further glory
of the Republic.
He sends regret that
he could not be present.
And a reminder
that a bargain was struck with
your father before he passed.
Concerning the sale
of Gannicus.
You dare broach subject
on such a fucking day?
We have respectfully waited
for eight of them to pass.
Your period of mourning
comes to conclusion.
Tomorrow the sun
greets a ninth day,
and with it we expect
delivery of Gannicus.
Turn desire towards
piss and shit,
and see yourselves
well satisfied.
Then Tullius will be forced
to withdraw offer
to include your men
in the opening games
of the new arena.
And all that follow.
Batiatus summons the men.
You will see her ashes
beneath the ground?
As is her people's custom.
There were many things that
I did not pause to ask her of.
Now I am but filled
with questions.
Speak of her, in quiet moments.
And see them answered.
Oenomaus...
She was the rarest of women.
A flower of beauty
and compassion,
in a world of shit.
so that her laugh
may once again fill solemn air.
She would not wish it.
She loved you.
As a brother.
As I loved her.
We have known
the agony of heart ripped
yet beating
from sundered chest.
And yet here we stand.
The House of Batiatus
is no stranger to misfortune.
and base men that would
position themselves as such.
And yet.
Here we stand.
This house is built
atop unshakable foundation
of honor and respect.
And in no man were these
qualities more evident
than Titus Lentulus Batiatus.
by seeing
the House of Batiatus elevated
beyond the imagining
of my ancestors.
I will need all
of you to see it done.
Men of hard purpose and desire.
Let previous
decisions fall aside.
None among you will
be sent to the mines,
Let us celebrate the name
Titus Lentulus Batiatus
with drink
and the clash of swords!
Their sound to carry my father
to the afterlife!
Take position!
Will you fight your man
to conclusion?
Or drop defense
and allow for hollow victory,
as you did with me
before Titus?
You are champion now.
Do not broach
fucking subject again.
yet live to one day die with
glory and honor in the arena!
Begin!
This is all that remains.
When the smoke clears
and the embers die.
This was my father's
last act before his death.
A bill of sale,
transferring your ownership.
The cause that moved you
to seek audience,
on the day I watched
my father burn?
Apologies, Dominus.
I could wait no longer.
To honor my father's wishes
sees you fall to control
of a man most hated.
To defy them sees
this house forever
excluded from the new arena.
A cock in the ass,
from either direction.
Speak, and give reason
to see this join
my father's ashes.
I have no words
towards such end.
I come to see
agreement honored.
You wish to leave this house?
I wish to see blood.
See me delivered to
Tullius' care,
and I will see his life
for your father's.
My father never aimed
a favored word towards you.
Yet you entreat to be
the instrument of his vengeance?
Or is it another
you seek it for?
You would sacrifice your life,
in the memory of hers?
I would sacrifice a thousand
if I had but had them.
If you had such
stirrings for Melitta,
why did you not fight harder
in the contest before my father?
You could have taken Crixus,
and remained here,
close to your heart's desires.
The match was lost
before sword was ever raised.
The same can be said
of your plan against Tullius.
He is forever surrounded
not only by his own men,
but by good citizens who
would quickly come to the aid
of such a "noble" Roman.
Then they too shall fall.
You do not fucking think!
This grants ownership
to Tullius'
lap dog Vettius!
You would be sent to
the boy's ludus in fucking Nola.
A year could pass
before you find yourself
close enough to Tullius.
I would suffer a lifetime but to
have the chance to strike.
This house would be
the one that suffers!
A year of the greatest
gladiator in the Republic
fighting for those shits!
A year of you needing
to win each fight
against my fucking men
in the hopes of gaining
an audience with Tullius.
Will he not wish to see the man
he has fought so hard to gain?
When so delivered?
Your desires are well noted.
I will weigh argument,
and come to an answer
in the balance.
Dominus.
Fetch more wine.
Vettius' appearance
was ill timed.
He is a dog,
untrained where not to shit.
The hand that grips his leash
is of greater concern.
Has Quintus voiced thought
towards Tullius?
He has not.
Yet what would any of us do,
to see the death
of one so loved avenged?
The very heart of my concern.
To take action against Tullius
is to invite
mortal consequence.
He has made repeated
attacks against this house.
You would have us do nothing?
I would have you live.
If the situation with Tullius
turns to further disadvantage...
Know that you may always
seek refuge beneath my roof.
As a friend.
Where is the fucking wine?
Naevia brings more.
I should take my leave.
Gannicus presses to honor
terms towards his sale.
Then the matter is resolved.
The man only desires
close proximity to Tullius,
and the villain's throat
beneath his hands.
He would kill Tullius for us?
Do you believe it possible?
You speak of madness!
Tullius is far too cautious
to ever lower guard.
Especially in
the presence of a man
loyal to the House of Batiatus.
And what would brave Solonius
do in my fucking position?!
Turn blind eye towards
the murder of his father?!
He would be certain to strike
appropriate target.
What if Tullius
had no hand in this?
His gift of wine
was tainted with death.
But was it by Tullius' hand?
Or another moved
by equal grievance?
What if Vettius
is the true cause of this?
The boy's hatred for you
is well known.
Vengeance would stand
a hollow vessel...
were it not filled
with retribution
against all who have
injured this house.
Including young Vettius.
You twist my intention!
He but straightens purpose.
Is this not what
set tragedy in motion?
Arrogance and impatience?
You are forever
reaching beyond grasp,
and dragging those
beside you as you fall.
And you have never
had the stomach
to do what it takes to make
a fucking name in this world!
Good Solonius,
forever bowing and scraping
in the shit of his betters.
Is it any wonder
no woman would have you?
Emotion carries us
beyond reason.
Solonius has been
as a brother to us.
It has been a trying day,
in a long succession of many.
Apologies.
I have asked much
of our friendship,
with little reward.
Yet I must seek more,
if we are to see injuries
against our house redressed.
What are your thoughts?
They yet stand clouded.
Come, let us
put minds together,
and see them cleared.
And even greater
responsibility.
Melitta held many years
as my body slave.
And shall be missed
beyond the measure of words.
I expect equal loyalty
from you now.
You must always
to stand by my side,
never to leave it.
Or this house.
As Diona chose.
to be so used by men
for base entertainment.
I understand.
Yet cannot forgive.
Yes, Domina.
is make promise
that no one will ever
lay hands upon you for sport.
Your maidenhood will be
preserved as precious gift,
and given only
to the most worthy.
As Melitta was
given to Oenomaus.
There.
We are forever
bound to each other.
Bring oil
and a sharpened blade.
I would be rid
of this fucking beard.
Solonius?
His courage hardened,
and hands set to task.
Then you have come to decision.
One that not even
good Tullius will see coming.
Gather my father's ashes.
And tell Oenomaus to prepare
Gannicus to leave these walls.
Batiatus again
spits in my face?
News absent surprise.
A snake by nature favors
maneuvering upon its belly.
I would stand upright.
Among honorable men.
Where does he take Gannicus?
Batiatus sent me to secure sale
to the Syrian trader Galeagra.
By morning Gannicus
will be on a ship
sailing towards points unknown.
Forever beyond your reach.
You aided Batiatus in this?
I have known the man
for many years.
I was...
conflicted.
As am I.
On whether to strip flesh
from your fucking face.
Wait!
I came to you with this!
After the fact.
There is still time!
He meets the Syrian
at the edge of the city!
Gather the men.
I cannot believe
even Batiatus so thick,
to imagine concealing
such an act.
He will spin story...
of Gannicus escaping.
To perhaps follow
his slave Diona,
who recently went to foot.
He thinks me the fool,
to accept the tale?
Batiatus knows you will
summon him to meeting.
To "discuss" the matter.
He lays plans to see much coin
in your men's hands.
Payment in aid against your life
when he stands before you.
The fucking cock on him.
Batiatus has always thought
himself above those around him.
Even closest friend.
I shall prove the notion false.
And see fucking son
join his father.
Where are they?
I will search ahead.
Stay where you are.
I would not
have you from my fucking side.
If you had sold me to Tullius,
no one else's
life would be at risk.
With great risk
comes greater reward.
And I would have mine.
The Syrians arrives.
I grow weary
of these games, Batiatus.
And would see them
to bitter end.
As would I.
Come.
Let us embrace,
you fucking cunt.
Fucking kill him Barca!
Fuck you!
You fucking shit!
You fuck!
Wait, hold!
Said hold!
Such a death...
would be far too quick.
Bind him.
And you.
You played your part
to fucking perfection!
It was not difficult.
When passion for vengeance
overtakes caution,
even the keenest of minds
is easily deceived.
Modest to the fucking last.
See these bodies put to grass.
Then get yourself
to the Medicus.
You are sure to your purpose?
My path has never been clearer.
Good Tullius.
Let us have final words.
Before you depart this life.
The lamb finally wakes.
Calm yourself.
I merely wish to break words.
Seek to raise alarm,
and find throat slit
well in advance of aid.
We are clear?
You are fucking dead.
Threats absent form,
without Tullius
to support them.
What have you done to him?
Me?
I have done nothing.
I have never known
quarrel with good Tullius.
Yet Batiatus...
he is of a contrary nature.
And moves even
as we speak to end
his conflict with your man.
Forever.
The opening of the arena
is upon us.
Tullius' absence will be noted.
And your part
in it quick upon heel.
You are mistaken.
No one will suspect
Tullius has left this world.
Not when trusted
Vettius heralds news
that he has unexpectedly
set sail abroad.
To attend pressing
matters in Antioch.
What would move tongue
to voice such fucking lie?
It more easily forms words
to see you and Batiatus
executed for your crimes.
Based upon what evidence?
We were not found
knife in hand,
kneeling beside body.
A body which even now Batiatus
conceals beyond
reach of human eyes.
No, my concern rests
with your safety.
Attempt to raise
unwarranted suspicion,
and Batiatus would
be sure to take offense.
And without Tullius
to protect you...
Ah.
Youth finally matures.
Now that we have settled issue,
let us turn to other matters.
Of a more personal nature...
What we hold close
to our hearts
eventually pass from this world.
And what we once
turned from in disgust...
We embrace as necessity.
Raise your eyes.
What do you see?
The Domina of this house.
Is that all?
I see a woman.
Unlike any I have seen before.
Better.
I did not think I pleased you.
When last called
to your chambers.
I love my husband,
beyond all men.
I would do anything for him.
And his legacy.
I do not need seek pleasure.
I need only your cock.
Speak of this,
and see it parted
from your body.
Yes, Domina.
Your hair and your beard
give the appearance
of a fucking animal.
I would have you reformed
into the semblance of a man.
To make the lie I must
tell myself more convincing...
A game well played, Batiatus.
Now let us come to terms.
Your man Gannicus obviously
means a good deal to you,
to press to such extremes.
I will cease my pursuit of him.
Offer more.
I will see your house
take prominence
in all upcoming games.
More.
Speak desire,
and see it attended.
I desire to see you suffer.
As I have suffered
at your fucking hands.
Your suffering
has only begun, lanista.
When it is discovered
what you have done to me!
You will not be discovered.
Nor missed.
Solonius moves young Vettius,
towards offering
proper explanation
Vettius?
The city will mourn.
Soon your name will
be spoken of less and less.
Until it is lost to history.
I should have had your life
at the beginning of this.
The mistake is mine,
having stayed hand
in respect of your father.
Respect?
Then pay it to the remains
of the man himself!
Tell him how high you hold him!
Even as your poisoned wine
robs him of fucking life!
Tell him!
Tell him, you fucking shit!
Why should I strike
against your father?
He was an honorable Roman.
A man who knew his place.
As I know yours.
There will be an accounting,
Batiatus.
For this and everything
that follows.
The gods will
see to it some day.
But not this one.
This arena was your life.
Add to its foundation.
Have eyes ever beheld
such a sight?
The laurel crown
of the Republic.
Its majesty even more evident
when viewed from the pulvinus.
A great honor,
to be invited by Tullius.
One I fear undeserved.
Yet he is a difficult
man to turn from.
A fact well known
to all present.
I am surprised by his delay.
The opening of the arena
has been the only
subject on his tongue.
Now he stands late
to his own celebration.
Apologies.
Tullius regrets
he will be absent altogether.
What could wrest him
from so high a perch?
Pressing concerns
abroad in Antioch.
His departure was...
unexpected.
The arena would not exist
without Tullius.
We would not be standing here,
were it not for his actions.
We should halt the celebrations
until his return.
Agreed.
I shall address the crowd...
Tullius sends hard
instruction for ceremony
to carry without him.
This arena was a gift
to his beloved city.
He would not see misfortune
to stand in the way
of the giving of it.
A most gracious offer,
well received.
Come.
Haunt Tullius'
place by my side,
possessing his spirit
for the occasion.
Again I must offer apology.
I make preparations
to follow Tullius to Antioch.
What of your ventures here?
Your ludus?
I am retiring from
the lowly call of the lanista.
In favor of station more
befitting a man of breeding.
What will become of your men?
They fight this very day.
I would not see your brief
labors turn to naught.
Solonius and I can make
fair offer to divide them.
Yet unnecessary.
Solonius and I have
already come to terms.
Terms?
I have transferred deed to all
my gladiators to Solonius,
under whose noble banner
they will fight this day.
You are indeed blessed,
Solonius.
Your ludus now stands above
all others in sheer numbers.
May the gods continue
to show favor.
Give good Solonius
all consideration
towards future games.
Tullius and I would have it so.
You are overly generous.
Come. I would see you away.
The boy all but runs from us.
Vettius has always been
little more than Tullius' pet.
Is it any wonder
he runs to heel
when leash is jerked?
Batiatus speaks truth.
Let us put absent
friends from mind,
and turn towards
the glories of the day.
You have done well.
I but dance
to the yank of strings.
Avoid them forming a noose,
and never return to Capua
while I draw breath.
I shall pray
for the day it ceases.
We were supposed to divide
Vettius' men among us.
What the fuck are you doing?
What it takes to make
a name in this world.
After years of
"bowing and scraping in shit".
Is that what this is about?
A few words spoken
in anger absent thought?
A few words?
You name me friend and brother,
yet at every turn remind
that I lack this trait or that.
You take information
given to aid
and move against Tullius,
absent regard of the difficult
position it places me.
You talk of nothing.
Every tongue that is not
your own is accused of the same.
It has taken years
and the price of blood,
but I at last see you
for what you are.
A man that holds no one
in esteem beyond himself.
I owe you gratitude.
Without you to show the way,
I would never have
raised nerve to betray
those closest to me.
What excuse does Solonius give?
None that merit consideration.
What has the crowd
in such a state?
Sextus announces executions
before the games begin.
Is that not one of yours,
Batiatus?
The girl on the end,
what was her name...
Diona.
Diona, yes.
Apologies, Batiatus.
The girl was only
rounded up this morning.
If you wish her removed
to be dealt with personally...
No.
To all others who would
seek to betray me.
Caburus is your man now,
Solonius.
Rise, and see him to purpose.
As you wish.
A pity,
to lose one so fetching.
Soon you join. Cunt.
Doctore.
I can fight.
Have word with dominus
I already have.
Aid your brothers in
preparing for the day.
You will fight again
when you are able.
Yes, Doctore.
You will face
Tasgetius and Synetos.
In the match before the primus.
Show all of Capua why you are
considered such a prize.
Fight.
And honor
the House of Batiatus.
There are many things
I would die for.
This house is
no longer among them.
Then fight for her.
Every life you take.
The blood you shed.
She will see it
from the afterlife.
Then I shall fill her eyes.
Crixus!
The sands have been moistened
with our first
offerings of blood!
But more is demanded
on such a day.
And you shall have it!
The houses of Solonius
and Batiatus
will battle each other
in deadly contest.
No mercy shown!
No quarter given!
The victors all to face
each in the primus!
You will school
that little shit
in the ways of a true lanista.
A lesson to be remembered.
It shall be a spectacle
the likes of which
the gods themselves
have never witnessed!
Glory to Capua!
Glory to Rome!
Yes!
Yes!
Once more Gannicus proves
himself a god of the arena!
Were that Tullius present
to witness such triumph!
Yet I fear the numbers stand
against you in the primus.
Numbers are meaningless.
A lesson good Solonius
is about to discover.
You shall stand
above all others
eclipsed only
by the gods themselves!
So at last meet upon the sands.
Two among many.
I give no shit about other men.
I shall prove myself against you
in proper contest.
We face Solonius' men,
not each other.
Then we shall stand alone,
absent thought of brotherhood.
Attend.
Your Dominus would have words.
Everything we have dreamed of.
Suffered and died for.
The worth of it all turns
upon this single moment.
Only one man will
claim victory this day
and earn the title
Champion of Capua.
And by the gods
that man will be
from the fucking
House of Batiatus!
Gladiators!
Form!
Many have fought this day.
Many have died,
their blood staining the sands.
Yet this arena towers above
all others in the republic.
Two great houses
face each other.
Yet every man
must ultimately stand
What are they doing?
It matters not.
Fire burns
within their breasts.
And it is fire that shall
bind them in final contest!
Fall to the sands
beyond the flames,
and find yourself
removed from the primus.
Fall within them,
and be removed from this world.
Do not die before we meet.
Split heaven with
the sound of your fury!
Begin!
First blood to Solonius!
Yeah!
Yes!
Yes!
It is a pity you did not land
more men
in the primus, Solonius.
I fear you may be
eliminated prematurely.
You crazy fuck.
Batiatus' men think
so little of his house,
Who stands now?
Capua!
Fuck!
Let us press advantage, brother!
Then decide who
is champion between us!
No!
Your men again
set upon each other
before common foe is defeated.
To be expected, when animals
are not properly trained.
Gannicus is mine!
It appears odds have shifted.
The odds return to balance.
Yes!
The House of Batiatus
stands fucking triumphant!
Apologies.
None required.
A most impressive showing.
I do but honor this city.
And my champion
continues to do the same.
I have mind towards
your man for my own games.
Listen how he
ignites the crowd.
Gannicus!
Would they not forever
remember this day,
and the men
responsible for it...
if Gannicus
were granted freedom?
Freedom?
I would have granted the same
in deference to the crowd.
An excellent suggestion.
You can always train
another gladiator.
Yet to conclude
the opening ceremonies
with such a blessing...
As I said.
I but honor this city.
Gannicus has proven himself
to the city of Capua!
Let him be rewarded...
With freedom!
Gannicus!
Gannicus!
After all we have suffered.
Gannicus is still lost to us.
I offered the man coin.
Freedom to come
and go as he pleases.
If he would yet
fight for our house.
Memories haunt the man.
Crixus afforded himself
well in the games.
Let us turn
our hope towards him,
that he may bring us honor
and good fortune.
Yes.
Let us place stock in the Gaul.
And see what ends
he may service.
Real proud of you brother.
I shall join you one day,
you mad fuck.
Of that there is no doubt.
We have not yet
had proper contest.
Win your own freedom,
and seek me out.
Crixus.
I was given this when I became
champion of this house.
Wear it with more honor
than I have.
You have earned the rudis.
Proof you no longer
stand a slave.
A lifetime of blood.
And victory.
It lifts troubled heart,
to see my brother
gain his freedom.
Melitta would have been proud.
Oenomaus...
She loved you.
Above all others.
The thought shall keep me warm.
Until I join her
in the afterlife.
I shall meet you both there.
Doctore.
Begin the day's training.
I would not hear
the name Gannicus
spoken within these walls.
Nor that of Tullius
or his cock eating apprentice.
These things are of the past.
Let us look towards
brighter future.
My eyes are firmly fixed.
We will see this house elevated.
Beyond my father.
Beyond Solonius.
Beyond the fucking gods
themselves.
We will leave
our mark upon this city.
And one day,
see proper reward
for all we have done.
I have done this
thing because it is just!
at the whims
of our masters for too long.
and together
we shall see Rome tremble!
warwerwor
