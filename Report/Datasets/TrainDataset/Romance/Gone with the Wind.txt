BRENT:
What do we care if we were expelled?
The war's gonna start,
so we would've left anyhow.
War! Isn’t it exciting, Scarlett?
-Those fool Yankees want a war.
BRENT: We'll show them!
Fiddle-dee-dee. War, war, war!
This war talk's spoiling
all the fun at every party.
I get so bored I could scream.
Besides, there isn't
going to be any war.
BRENT: Not gonna be any war?
-Of course there'll be a war.
If either of you boys
says "war" once again...
...I'll go in the house.
-But, Scarlett!
-Don't you want us to have a war?
BRENT: Wait a minute, honey, please!
STUART: We're sorry.
SCARLETT:
Well....
But remember, I warned you.
I've got an idea!
We'll talk about the Wilkes' barbecue
at Twelve Oaks.
You're eating barbecue with us,
aren't you?
I haven't thought about that yet.
I'll think about that tomorrow.
We want all your waltzes.
First Brent, then me,
then Brent, and so on.
-Promise?
-Why, I'd just love to.
If only I didn't have every one
of them taken already.
-You can't do that to us!
-We'll tell you a secret.
A secret? Who by?
You know Melanie Hamilton?
Ashley Wilkes' cousin?
She's visiting--
That goody-goody!
Who wants to know about her?
Anyway, we heard-- They say--
Ashley Wilkes is gonna marry her.
-Wilkeses always marry their cousins.
STUART: Do we get those waltzes?
Of course.
-It can't be true! Ashley loves me!
STUART: Scarlett!
-What's gotten into her?
-Suppose we made her mad?
Where are you going without your
shawl and the night air coming?
How come you didn't ask them
gentlemen to supper?
You got no more manners
than a field hand.
After me and Miss Ellen
done labored with you!
Come on in before you catch
your death of dampness.
No! I'm going to wait
for Pa to come home.
Come on in here!
Come on!
Mm-mm-mm!
FIELD HAND:
Quitting time!
-Who says it's quitting time?
-I said.
I's the foreman. I say
when it's quitting time at Tara.
Quitting time!
Quitting time!
There's none in the county
can touch you, and none in the state.
Pa!
How proud of yourself you are!
GERALD: Well, Katie Scarlett O'Hara,
so you've been spying on me.
Like your sister, you'll tell
your mother that I was jumping again.
You know I'm no tattletale
like Suellen.
But after you broke your knee
last year jumping that fence--
I'll not have me own daughter telling me
what I shall jump and not jump.
It's my own neck, so it is.
All right, Pa, you jump what you please.
-How are they at Twelve Oaks?
-The Wilkeses?
In the stew you'd expect with a barbecue
and talking nothing but war.
Bother the war!
Was there anyone else there?
Their cousin Melanie
and her brother, Charles.
Melanie Hamilton is a pale-faced,
mealy-mouthed ninny!
Ashley Wilkes doesn't think so.
Ashley Wilkes couldn't like
anyone like her.
What's your interest
in Ashley and Miss Melanie?
Nothing. Let's go into the house.
Has he been trifling with you?
Has he asked you to marry him?
-No.
-Nor will he.
I had it in strict confidence
from John Wilkes today...
...Ashley's going to marry Melanie.
It'll be announced
tomorrow night at the ball.
I don't believe it!
GERALD:
Here! Where are you off to?
Scarlett!
What are you about?
Have you been running after a man
who's not in love with you?
When you might have any other?
I haven't been running after him,
it's just a surprise.
Now, don't be jerking
your chin at me!
If Ashley wanted to marry you,
I'd have misgivings.
I want my girl to be happy.
You'd not be happy with him.
I would! I would!
What's the difference who you marry?
So long as he's a Southerner.
And when I'm gone
I'll leave Tara to you.
I don't want it.
It doesn't mean anything--
Do you mean to tell me,
Katie Scarlett O'Hara...
...that land doesn't mean
anything to you?
Land is the only thing in the
world worth working for...
...worth fighting for, worth dying for.
-It's the only thing that lasts!
-You talk like an Irishman.
It's proud I am that I'm Irish.
Don't you be forgetting...
...that you're half Irish too.
To anyone with a drop
of Irish blood in them...
...the land they live on
is like their mother.
But there now. You're just a child.
It'll come to you,
this love of the land.
There's no getting away from it
if you're Irish.
MAMMY:
Here she comes!
Scarlett, Suellen, Carreen,
your mama's home!
Acting like a wet nurse to
them white-trash Slatterys...
...instead of eating her supper.
Set up the fire!
Got no business wearing herself out....
Pork! Take the lamp
out on the porch.
Wearing herself out.
Mr. Gerald, Miss Ellen's home!
Waiting on them poor white trash.
Shut up, dog!
Barking in the house!
Get up from there!
Don't you hear Miss Ellen?
Get out there and get
her medicine chest!
PORK:
We was worried about you, Miss Ellen.
It's all right, Pork. I'm home.
WILKERSON: Mrs. O'Hara, we finished
plowing the creek bottom today.
What do you want me
to start on tomorrow?
Mr. Wilkerson, I've just come
from Emmie Slattery's bedside.
Your child has been born.
My child, ma'am?
I'm sure I don't understand.
Has been born and
mercifully has died.
Good night, Mr. Wilkerson.
MAMMY: I fix your supper myself
and you eats it.
-Yes, after prayers, Mammy.
-Yes'm.
Mr. O'Hara, you must
dismiss Jonas Wilkerson.
Dismiss him, Mrs. O'Hara?
He's the best overseer in the county.
He must go tomorrow morning,
the first thing!
-No.
-Yes.
The Yankee Wilkerson and
the white-trash Slattery girl?
-We'll discuss it later, Mr. O'Hara.
-Yes, Mrs. O'Hara.
SUELLEN: Scarlett's dress
is prettier than mine!
Can't she wear my pink dress?
I wanna wear Scarlett's green dress.
I don't like your tone, Suellen.
Your pink gown's lovely.
CARREEN: Can't I stay up for the ball?
-You may wear my garnets.
CARREEN: Why can't I stay up for
the ball tomorrow?
Scarlett. You look tired, my dear.
I'm worried about you.
I'm all right, Mother.
Why can't I stay up for the ball?
I'm 13 now.
You may go to the barbecue.
I didn't want your tacky dress anyhow!
-Hush up!
ELLEN: Prayers, girls.
--and to all the saints, that I have
sinned in thought, word and deed...
...through my fault, through my fault,
through my most grievous fault.
Therefore, I beseech thee,
blessed Mary, ever virgin...
...blessed Michael the Archangel...
...blessed John the Baptist...
...the Holy Apostles, Peter and Paul,
and all the saints...
...pray to the Lord....
Ashley doesn't know I love him.
I'll tell him that I love him...
...and then he can't marry.
Hear thee Almighty,
most merciful Lord...
...grant us pardon, absolution
and remission of our sins. Amen.
Ooh!
Just hold on and suck in!
Mammy, here's
Miss Scarlett's vittles.
Take it back to the kitchen.
I won't eat a bite.
Yes'm, you is!
You's gonna eat every mouthful.
No, I'm not!
Put on the dress.
We're late already.
-What my lamb gonna wear?
-That.
No, you ain't! You can't show
your bosom before 3:00!
I'm gonna speak to your ma!
If you say one word to mother,
I won't eat a bite.
Well....
Keep your shawl on. I ain't
aiming for you to get freckled...
...after the buttermilk I done put
on you, bleaching them freckles.
Now, Miss Scarlett. You come on
and be good and eat just a little, honey.
No! I'm going to have a good time
today and eat at the barbecue.
If you don't care
what folks says, I does!
You can always tell a lady by how
she eats in front of folks like a bird.
I ain't aiming for you to go to
John Wilkes' and gobble like a hog!
Fiddle-dee-dee!
Ashley told me he likes
girls with a healthy appetite.
MAMMY: What gentlemens says
and thinks is different things.
And I ain't noticed Mr. Ashley
asking for to marry you.
Now don't eat too fast. Ain't no need
a having it come right back up again.
Why is it a girl has to be
so silly to catch a husband?
GERALD: Scarlett O'Hara! If you're not
down here by the time I count 10...
-...we'll go without you!
-I'm coming, Pa!
GERALD:
One, two, three, four, five....
Oh, dear!
My stays are so tight, I'll never
get through the day without belching!
GERALD:
Well, John Wilkes.
-It's a grand day for the barbecue.
-So it seems, Gerald.
Why isn't Mrs. O'Hara with you?
She's settling accounts with the overseer,
but she'll be along tonight.
-Welcome to Twelve Oaks, Mr. O'Hara.
-Thank you kindly, India.
Your daughter's getting
prettier every day, John.
Here are the O'Hara girls.
We must greet them.
I can't stand Scarlett.
She throws herself at Ashley.
That's your brother's business.
You must remember
your duties as hostess.
Good morning, girls.
You're looking lovely.
Good morning, Scarlett.
India Wilkes,
what a lovely dress!
I just can't take my eyes off it.
Good morning, Miss Scarlett.
You look mighty fine
this morning, Miss Scarlett.
It's a pleasure to see you,
Miss Scarlett.
Ashley!
Scarlett, my dear!
I've been looking for you everywhere.
I've got something I must tell you.
Can't we go someplace quiet?
Yes, I'd like to, but I have
something to tell you too.
Something I hope
you'll be glad to hear.
Come say hello
to my cousin Melanie first.
Oh, do we have to?
She's been looking forward
to seeing you again. Melanie!
ASHLEY: Here's Scarlett.
-Scarlett!
I'm so glad to see you again.
Melanie, what a surprise
to run into you here.
I hope you'll stay with us a few days.
I hope I shall stay long enough
for us to become real friends.
-I do want us to be.
-We'll keep her here, won't we?
We'll make the biggest fuss over her!
If anybody can give a girl
a good time, it's Ashley.
Our good times must seem silly
to you. You're so serious.
Oh, Scarlett, you have so much life.
I've always admired you.
I wish I could be more like you.
You mustn't flatter me
and say things you don't mean.
Nobody could accuse Melanie
of being insincere. Could they, my dear?
She's not like you, is she, Ashley?
He never means a word
he says to any girl.
Why, Charles Hamilton,
you handsome old thing, you!
But, Miss O'Hara, I--
Was it kind to bring your good-looking
brother here to break my poor heart?
Now that Charles is your beau,
she's after him like a hornet.
Charles, I want to eat
barbecue with you.
Don't go philandering with any other girl,
because I'm mighty jealous.
I won't, Miss O'Hara.
I couldn't!
I do declare, Frank Kennedy! You look
dashing with those new whiskers.
Thank you, thank you, Miss Scarlett.
Charles and Wade asked me to eat with
them, but I told them I promised you.
You needn't be so amused.
She's after your beau now.
That's mighty flattering of you,
Miss Scarlett.
I'll see what I can do.
Why's your sister mad?
You sparking her beau?
As if I couldn't do better
than that old maid in britches.
SCARLETT: Brent and Stuart,
you handsome old things!
-I didn't mean it. I'm mad at you!
-What have we done?
You haven't been near me all day!
I wore this old dress for you.
I was counting on eating with you.
-You are, Scarlett.
-Of course you are, honey.
I never can make up my mind
which of you is the handsomest.
I was awake all last night
trying to figure it out.
Oh, shucks!
-Cathleen, who's that?
-Who?
That man looking at us and smiling.
The nasty dark one.
Don't you know? That's Rhett Butler.
He's from Charleston.
He has a most terrible reputation.
He looks as if he knows
what I look like without my shimmy.
My dear, he isn't received.
He spends his time up North
because his folks won't speak to him.
He was expelled
from West Point, he's so fast.
And there's that business
about the girl he wouldn't marry.
Tell, tell!
He took her out buggy-riding in
the late afternoon without a chaperon...
...and then he refused to marry her!
No, but she was ruined just the same.
Ashley....
-Happy?
-So happy.
ASHLEY:
You seem to belong here...
...as if it had all been
imagined for you.
I like to feel that I belong
to the things you love.
-You love Twelve Oaks as I do.
-Yes, Ashley.
I love it as more than a house.
It's a whole world that wants only
to be graceful and beautiful.
It's so unaware
that it may not last forever.
You're afraid of what may happen
if the war comes?
But we don't have to be afraid for us.
No war can come into our world, Ashley.
Whatever comes, I'll love you...
...just as I do now, until I die.
Isn’t this better than a table?
A girl hasn't got but two sides
to her at a table.
-I'll get her dessert.
-She said me!
Allow me, Miss O'Hara?
I think....
Hmm....
I think Charles Hamilton may get it.
Thank you, Miss O'Hara.
Thank you!
STUART: Go get it, boy!
Isn’t he the luckiest....
Miss O'Hara...
...I love you.
I don't guess I'm as hungry
as I thought.
Why do I have to take a nap?
I'm not tired.
Well-brought-up ladies
takes naps at parties.
It's time you behave and act
like you was Miss Ellen's daughter.
When we were in Saratoga,
I didn't see Yankee girls taking naps.
And you won't see no Yankee
girls at the ball, neither.
How was Ashley today?
He didn't pay much attention to you.
You mind your own business!
You'll be lucky you don't lose
whisker-face Kennedy.
You're sweet on Ashley, and his
engagement's being announced tonight.
That's as much as you know.
You ought to behave yourself!
Acting like poor white-trash children!
If you's old enough for parties,
you should act like ladies!
Who cares?
GERALD: We've borne enough insults
from the Yankees.
We'll keep our slaves
with or without their approval.
'Twas the sovereign right of
Georgia to secede from the Union.
The South must assert herself
by force of arms.
After we've fired on the Yankee rascals
at Fort Sumter, we've got to fight.
-There's no other way.
MAN 1: That's right!
MAN 1:
Let the Yankees ask for peace.
The situation's very simple.
The Yankees can't fight and we can.
There won't be a battle.
They'll turn and run.
BRENT: One of us can lick 20 Yanks.
STUART: We'll beat them in one battle.
Gentlemen can always fight
better than rabble.
Gentlemen always fight better.
GERALD: What does the captain
of our Troop say?
Well, gentlemen,
if Georgia fights, I go with her.
I hope the Yankees let us
leave the Union in peace.
BRENT:
Ashley, they've insulted us!
STUART:
You can't mean you don't want war?
Most of the miseries of the world
were caused by wars.
And when the wars were over,
no one ever knew what they were about.
Now, gentlemen. Mr. Butler's
been up North, I hear.
Don't you agree with us?
I think it's hard winning
a war with words.
What do you mean, sir?
There's not a cannon factory
in the whole South.
What difference does that make
to a gentleman?
It'll make a great difference
to a great many gentlemen, sir.
Are you hinting
that the Yankees can lick us?
No, I'm not hinting.
I'm saying plainly, the Yankees
are better equipped than we.
They've got factories,
shipyards, coal mines...
...and a fleet to bottle up
our harbors and starve us.
All we've got is cotton and slaves,
and arrogance.
I refuse to listen
to any renegade talk!
-I'm sorry if the truth offends you.
-Apologies aren't enough, sir.
I hear you were turned out
of West Point, Mr. Rhett Butler.
And you aren't received in
any family in Charleston.
Not even your own!
I apologize again
for all my shortcomings.
Perhaps you won't mind if
I look over your place?
I seem to be spoiling everybody's
brandy and cigars...
...and dreams of victory.
CHARLES: That's what you can expect
from somebody like Rhett Butler.
GERALD:
You did everything but call him out.
-He refused to fight.
-Not quite there, Charles.
-He refused to take advantage of you.
-Take advantage of me?
He's one of the best shots in the country,
as he's proved many times.
-He's got steadier hands than yours.
-Well, I'll show him!
Please. Don't go tweaking
his nose anymore.
You may be needed for more
important fighting.
If you'll excuse me,
Mr. Butler's our guest.
I think I'll just show him around.
SCARLETT :
Ashley!
Ashley....
Scarlett.
Who are you hiding from in here?
What are you up to?
Why aren't you upstairs,
resting with the other girls?
What is this, Scarlett, a secret?
Oh, Ashley....
Ashley!
-I love you.
-Scarlett!
I love you, I do!
Isn’t it enough that you gathered
every other man's heart today?
You've always had mine.
You cut your teeth on it.
Don't tease me now.
Have I your heart, my darling?
I love you, I love you!
You mustn't say such things.
You'll hate me for hearing them.
I could never hate you,
and I know you must care about me.
You do care, don't you?
Yes, I care.
Can't we go away
and forget we ever said these things?
SCARLETT:
But how can we do that?
Don't you--?
Don't you want to marry me?
I'm going to marry Melanie.
But you can't!
Not if you care for me!
Oh, my dear, why must you make me
say things that will hurt you?
How can I make you understand?
You're so young, you don't
know what marriage means.
I know I love you,
and I want to be your wife.
You don't love Melanie.
She's like me, Scarlett.
She's my blood
and we understand each other.
But you love me!
How could I help loving you?
You have all the passion
for life that I lack.
That kind of love isn't enough
for two people as different as we are.
Why not say it, you coward?
You're afraid to marry me.
You'd marry that fool
who can only say...
..."yes," "no" and raise
a passel of mealy-mouthed brats!
You mustn't say that!
Who are you to tell me I mustn't?
You led me on!
-You made me believe you'd marry me.
-Scarlett, be fair!
-I never at any time--
-You did! It's true, you did!
I'll hate you till I die!
I can't think of anything
bad enough to call you!
Has the war started?
Sir, you should have made
your presence known.
In the middle of that
beautiful love scene?
That wouldn't have been tactful,
would it?
But don't worry.
Your secret is safe with me.
-Sir, you are no gentleman.
-And you, miss, are no lady.
I don't hold that against you.
Ladies never held any charm for me.
First you take advantage of me,
then you insult me!
I meant it as a compliment.
I hope to see more of you, when
you're free of the spell of Mr. Wilkes.
He doesn't strike me as good
enough for a girl of your--
What was it?
Your "passion for living."
How dare you!
You aren't fit to wipe his boots!
And you were going to hate him
for the rest of your life.
INDIA: She certainly made a fool
of herself running after all the men.
MELANIE:
That's not fair, India.
She's so attractive,
men naturally flock to her.
INDIA:
Melanie, you're just too good to be true.
-Didn't you see her going after Charles?
-And she knows Charles belongs to me.
You're wrong, India.
Scarlett's just high-spirited
and vivacious.
INDIA: Men flirt with girls like that,
but they don't marry them.
MELANIE:
I think you're being very mean to her.
Miss O'Hara!
Miss O'Hara!
Mr. Lincoln's called volunteers
to fight against us!
Don't you men think
about anything important?
But it's war! Everybody's going off
to enlist. I'm going too!
Everybody?
CHARLES:
Miss O'Hara, will you be sorry?
To see us go?
I'll cry into my pillow every night.
Miss O'Hara, I told you I loved you.
You're the most beautiful girl in the world,
and the sweetest, the dearest.
I couldn't hope that you could love me.
I'm so clumsy and stupid
and not nearly good enough for you.
But if you could think of marrying me,
I'd do anything in the world for you.
Just anything, I promise.
What did you say?
Miss O'Hara, I said,
"Would you marry me?"
Yes, Mr. Hamilton, I will.
You will? You'll marry me?
You'll wait for me?
-I don't think I'd want to wait.
-You'll marry me before I go?
Oh, Miss O'Hara! Scarlett.
-When may I speak to your father?
-The sooner the better.
I'll go now, I can't wait.
Will you excuse me, dear?
Dear!
Mr. O'Hara! Mr. O'Hara!
-It'll be a week before they call me.
-A week till they take you away from me!
Oh, Ashley.
I thought of you
at our wedding yesterday...
...and I hoped yours
would be as beautiful.
-And it was!
-Was it?
Now we're really and truly sisters.
-Charles!
-Melanie.
Don't cry, darling.
The war will be over in a few weeks,
and I'll be coming back to you.
Miss Scarlett!
I don't care!
I'm too young to be a widow.
Miss Scarlett!
Why, I'd just go around
scaring people in that thing.
You shouldn't be around people.
You's in mourning!
For what? I don't feel anything.
Why should I have to
pretend and pretend?
What is it?
Oh, poor baby!
What is it?
SCARLETT:
My life is over!
-Nothing will ever happen to me anymore!
-Darling....
Oh, Mother,
I know you think I'm horrible.
But I just can't bear
going around in black.
It's bad enough not being able to
go to parties. But looking this way too?
I don't think you're at all horrible.
It's only natural you want to look young
and be young when you are young.
Oh, baby!
How would you like to visit somewhere?
Savannah, perhaps?
What would I do in Savannah?
Well, Atlanta then.
There's lots going on there.
And you can stay with Melanie
and her Aunt Pittypat.
Melanie?
Yes.
Yes, I could, couldn't I?
Oh, Mother, you're sweeter
than anybody in the world!
You'd like it, really?
All right, then.
Now stop your crying and smile.
You can take Prissy with you.
Start packing
Miss Scarlett's things, Mammy.
I'll go write the necessary letters.
Atlanta!
Savannah would be better for you.
You'll get in trouble in Atlanta.
What are you talking about?
You know what I's talking about.
I'm talking about Mr. Ashley Wilkes.
He'll come to Atlanta for his leave
and you waiting for him just like a spider!
-He belongs to Miss Melanie--
-Go pack my things like Mother said!
They're all whispering,
and I know it's about her!
What's it matter, Pittypat?
Scarlett's living under my roof,
so they think I'm responsible for her.
And for a widow to appear in public
at a social gathering...
...every time I think of it, I feel faint.
You know Scarlett came here
only to help raise money for the Cause.
It was splendid of her
to make the sacrifice.
Anyone hearing you talk would think
she came to dance instead of sell things.
DR. MEADE: Ladies and gentlemen,
I have important news! Glorious news!
Another triumph
for our magnificent men in arms!
General Lee has completely
whipped the enemy...
...and swept the Yankee army
northward from Virginia!
And now, a happy surprise
for all of us.
We have with us tonight, that most
daring of all blockade runners...
...whose fleet schooners,
slipping past the Yankee guns...
...have brought us here the very
woolens and laces we wear tonight.
I refer, ladies and gentlemen, to that
will-o'-the-wisp of the bounding main.
None other than our friend
from Charleston...
...Captain Rhett Butler!
Permit me.
Captain Butler, such a pleasure
to see you again.
I met you last at my husband's home.
That's kind of you to remember,
Mrs. Wilkes.
Did you meet Captain Butler
at Twelve Oaks, Scarlett?
Yes, I-- I think so.
Only for a moment.
It was in the library.
You had broken something.
Yes, Captain Butler, I remember you.
Ladies, the Confederacy asks for your
jewelry on behalf of our noble Cause.
We aren't wearing any.
We're in mourning.
Wait.
On behalf of Mrs. Wilkes
and Mrs. Hamilton.
Thank you, Captain Butler.
Just a moment, please.
But it's your wedding ring, ma'am.
It may help my husband more
off my finger.
Thank you.
That was a very beautiful thing to do.
Here.
You can have mine too.
For the Cause.
And you, Mrs. Hamilton.
I know just how much that means to you.
DR.MEADE:
Melanie?
-Dr. Meade?
-I need your approval...
...for something we want to do
that's rather shocking.
DR. MEADE:
Will you excuse us?
I'll say one thing. The war makes
the most peculiar widows.
I wish you'd go away!
If you had any raising, you'd know
I'd never want to see you again!
Now, why be silly?
You've no reason for hating me.
I'll carry your guilty secret
to my grave.
I'd be very unpatriotic to hate
a great hero of the war.
I declare, I was surprised you
turned out to be a noble character.
I can't bear to take advantage
of your little-girl ideas.
I'm neither noble nor heroic.
-But you are a blockade runner?
-For profit, and profit only.
You don't believe in the Cause?
Rhett Butler is the only cause I know.
The rest doesn't mean much to me.
And now, ladies and gentlemen...
...I have a startling surprise
for the benefit of the hospital.
Gentlemen, if you wish to lead the reel
with the lady of your choice...
...you must bid for her!
Caroline Meade, how can you let your
husband conduct this slave auction!
Darlene Merriwether,
how dare you criticize me!
Melanie told the doctor that
if it's for the Cause, it's quite all right.
She did?
Oh, dear! Oh, dear!
Where are my smelling salts?
-I think I shall faint.
-Don't you dare faint, Pittypat!
If Melanie says it's all right,
it is all right.
DR. MEADE: Come, gentlemen,
do I hear your bids? Make your offers!
Don't be bashful, gentlemen!
Twenty dollars! Twenty dollars
for Miss Maybelle Merriwether!
Twenty-five dollars
for Miss Fanny Elsing!
DR. MEADE:
Only $25 to give your--
-One hundred and fifty dollars in gold.
-For what lady, sir?
For Mrs. Charles Hamilton.
-For whom, sir?
-Mrs. Charles Hamilton.
Mrs. Hamilton is in mourning.
But I'm sure any of our Atlanta belles
would be proud to--
Dr. Meade, I said
Mrs. Charles Hamilton.
She will not consider it, sir.
Oh, yes, I will!
WOMAN 1:
My goodness gracious!
PITTY:
Ooh! Ooh!
Choose your partners
for the Virginia reel!
We've shocked the Confederacy.
It's like blockade running, isn't it?
It's worse. I expect
a very fancy profit out of it.
I don't care what you expect.
I'm gonna dance and dance!
Tonight I wouldn't mind dancing
with Abe Lincoln himself!
Another dance and my reputation
will be lost forever.
With enough courage
you can do without a reputation.
Oh, you do talk scandalous!
You do waltz divinely, Captain Butler.
Don't start flirting with me.
I'm not one of your plantation beaus.
I want more than flirting from you.
What do you want?
I'll tell you, Scarlett O'Hara, if you'll take
that Southern belle simper off your face.
Someday I want you to say to me the
words I heard you say to Ashley Wilkes.
"I love you."
That's something you'll never hear
from me as long as you live.
MELANIE: How sweet. How kind.
He is a thoughtful gentleman.
SCARLETT: Why doesn't he say
something about my sacrifice?
SCARLETT:
Oh. Oh!
Oh, the darling thing!
Oh, Rhett, it's lovely, lovely!
You didn't really bring it
all the way from Paris just for me.
Yes, I thought it was about time
I got you out of that fake mourning.
Next trip I'll bring you some
green silk for a frock to match it.
-Oh, Rhett.
-It's my duty to our...
...brave boys at the front to
keep our girls at home looking pretty.
SCARLETT:
It's so long since I had anything new!
How do I look?
Awful! Just awful!
Why? What's the matter?
This war's stopped being a joke when
a girl doesn't know the latest fashion.
Oh, Rhett! Let me do it.
But, Rhett, I don't know
how I'd dare wear it!
You will, though.
And another thing, those pantalets!
I don't know a woman in Paris
who wears pantalets anymore.
What do they--? You shouldn't
talk about such things.
You don't mind my knowing about them,
just my talking about them.
I can't go on accepting these gifts,
though you're awfully kind.
I'm not kind. I'm tempting you.
I never give without expecting
something in return. I always get paid.
I won't marry you
to pay for the bonnet.
Don't flatter yourself.
I'm not a marrying man.
Well, I won't kiss you for it either.
Open your eyes and look at me.
No, I don't think I will kiss you.
Although you need kissing, badly.
That's what's wrong with you.
You should be kissed, and often.
And by someone who knows how.
And I suppose you think
you're the proper person!
I might be, if the right moment
ever came.
You're a conceited,
black-hearted varmint!
I don't know why
I let you come and see me.
I'll tell you why, Scarlett.
I'm the only man over 16 and under 60
who's around to show you a good time.
But cheer up.
The war can't last much longer.
Really, Rhett? Why?
There's a battle going on now
that ought to fix things...
-...one way or the other.
-Oh, Rhett.
Is Ashley in it?
So you haven't gotten the wooden-headed
Mr. Wilkes out of your mind.
-Yes, I suppose he's in it.
-But tell me, where is it?
Some little town in Pennsylvania
called Gettysburg.
MAN:
Casualty lists! Casualty lists!
WOMAN:
Please! Please!
Here you is. They was fighting
for them so, it got tore in half.
Scarlett, you look.
The W's at the end.
Wellman, Wendel, White, Whitman,
Wilkens, Williams, Woolsey, Wortman--
Scarlett, you've passed him!
He isn't there! He isn't there!
Ashley's safe, he isn't listed!
Oh, he's safe. He's safe!
Scarlett, you're so sweet to worry
about Ashley like this for me.
I must go to her.
Don't, my dear. Not here.
Let's go home.
Dr. Meade, not--?
Yes, our boy Darcy.
I was making these mittens for him.
He won't need them now.
Well, I'm gonna enlist.
I'll show them!
I'll kill those Yankees!
You hush your mouth.
You think it'll help your mother
to have you shot too? It's silly!
It's a black day, Scarlett.
Haven't had bad news, have you?
-Ashley's safe.
-I'm glad, for Mrs. Wilkes' sake.
There are so many others.
-Any of your friends?
-About every family in the county.
-The Tarleton boys, both of them.
-Yes.
Look at them.
All these poor tragic people.
The South's sinking to its knees.
It'll never rise again.
The Cause.
The cause of living in the past
is dying right in front of us.
I never heard you talk like that.
I'm angry. Waste always makes me angry
and that's what this is, sheer waste!
But don't you be downcast.
Ashley's still alive to come home
to the women who love him.
Both of them.
MELANIE:
You're here!
Oh, you're here!
You're really here at last!
Oh, my dear, I've waited so long!
Melanie, my dear, my darling wife!
But we're forgetting Scarlett.
ASHLEY:
Scarlett, dear.
Why, is this any way to greet
a returning warrior?
Ashley, I....
I....
Merry Christmas, Ashley.
Come on, old gentleman, come on.
We's ate all your wives.
We's ate all your little chicks.
You got nobody to worry
your head about leaving.
Come on. Now you just
stand still so you...
...can be Christmas
for the white folks.
Now, hold on!
Hold on!
Don't go getting so uppity.
Even if you is the last chicken
in Atlanta.
SCARLETT:
Let's not talk about the war.
Let's talk Twelve Oaks and Tara
and times before there was a war.
Could we have the wine?
PITTY: Why did you say there
wasn't enough?
There's plenty. It's the very last
of my father's fine Madeira.
He got it from his uncle
Admiral Will Hamilton of Savannah...
...who married his cousin
Jessica Carroll of Carrolton...
...who was his second cousin
and akin to the Wilkeses too.
I saved it to wish Ashley
a merry Christmas.
But you mustn't drink it all at once,
because it is the last.
I meant it, my dear.
It was a lovely Christmas gift.
Only generals have tunics like this.
I'm so happy you like it.
Where did you get the cloth?
It was sent by a Charleston lady.
I nursed her son while he was
in the hospital before he died and--
You will take good care of it, won't you?
You won't let it get torn.
Promise me.
You mustn't worry.
I'll bring it back to you
without any holes in it. I promise.
ASHLEY: Good night, my dear.
-Good night, Scarlett, darling.
Uncle Peter, is it time
for Mr. Ashley to leave?
Pretty quick now, Miss Scarlett.
Melanie isn't going to the depot?
She hasn't changed her mind?
No, ma'am, she's laying down.
She's so upset, Mr. Wilkes told her
she can't even come downstairs.
Ashley....
Ashley, let me go to the depot with you.
Scarlett, I'd rather remember
you as you are now.
Not shivering at the depot.
All right.
Ashley, I've got a present for you too!
Why, Scarlett, it's beautiful!
Tie it on me, my dear.
While Melly was making a new tunic,
I made this to go with it.
You made it yourself?
Well, then I shall
value it all the more.
You know there's nothing
I wouldn't do for you.
There's something you can do for me.
What is it?
Will you look after Melanie for me?
She's so frail and gentle,
and she loves you so much.
-If I were killed--
-You mustn't say that! It's bad luck.
Say a prayer, quickly.
You say one for me.
We shall need all our prayers.
Now the end is coming.
-The end?
-The end of the war...
...and the end of our world, Scarlett.
But you don't think
the Yankees are beating us?
Oh, Scarlett,
my men are barefooted now!
And the snow in Virginia's deep.
When I see them, and I see
the Yankees coming and coming...
...always more and more!
When the end does come,
I shall be far away.
It'll be a comfort to me
to know that she has you.
You will promise, won't you?
Yes.
Is that all, Ashley?
All except...goodbye.
Oh, Ashley, I can't let you go!
-You must be brave. You must!
-No, no!
How else can I bear going?
Oh, Scarlett! You're so fine
and strong and beautiful.
Not just your sweet face, my dear...
...but you.
Ashley, kiss me. Kiss me goodbye.
Ashley.
ASHLEY: No, Scarlett. No!
-Oh, Ashley, I love you.
I've always loved you.
I've never loved anyone else.
I only married Charles just to hurt you.
Ashley, tell me you love me.
I'll live on it the rest of my life!
Goodbye.
When the war's over, Ashley.
When the war's over.
SOLDIER:
--and there's a place back home...
...where a wild plum tree
comes to flower in the springtime...
...down by the creek, you know.
Yes, I know, I know.
SOLDIER: When we were little,
my brother Jeff and I used to--
I told you about my brother Jeff,
didn't I, ma'am?
I know I did. He....
We don't know
where Jeff is now, ma'am.
Since Bull Run,
we haven't heard anything and--
Please, we must have
your temperature now.
Just take this in your mouth
and not talk anymore. Not just now.
Melanie, I'm so tired.
I've got to go home.
Aren't you tired, Melanie?
No, I'm not tired, Scarlett.
This might be Ashley...
...and only strangers here
to comfort him.
No, I'm not tired, Scarlett.
They could all be...
...Ashley.
BELLE: I've been waiting one solid hour
to speak to you, Mrs. Wilkes.
Go on, you trash.
Don't you be pestering these ladies.
-Don't talk to her.
-It's all right. Who are you?
My name's Belle Watling.
But that don't matter.
You think I got no business here.
Tell me what you want
to see me about.
First time I come here, I says,
"Belle, you're a nurse."
They didn't want my kind of nursing.
They was more than likely right.
Then I tried giving them money.
My money wasn't good enough either!
The old peahens!
I know a gentleman who says
you're a human being.
If you are, which they ain't,
you'll take my money for the hospital.
What are you doing here?
Haven't you been told twice already?
This time I'm conversing
with Mrs. Wilkes!
You might as well take my money.
It's good money, even if it is mine.
-I'm sure you're very generous.
-I'm a Confederate, like everybody else.
Of course you are!
Some folks here wouldn't feel that way.
But maybe they ain't
as good Christians as you.
Look, Mrs. Meade,
it's a great deal of money.
Ten, 20, 30, 50!
And it's not our paper money,
it's gold!
Let me see that handkerchief. R.B.!
And she's driving away
in Rhett Butler's carriage!
Oh, if I just wasn't a lady,
what wouldn't I tell that varmint!
"The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not want.
He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.
He restoreth my soul.
He leadeth me in the paths of
righteousness for His name's sake.
Yea, though I walk through
the valley of the shadow of death...
...I will fear no evil,
for Thou art with me.
Thy rod and Thy staff,
they comfort me."
SOLDIER 1:
The Yankees!
Yankees! Oh, Dr. Meade,
they're getting closer.
They'll never get into Atlanta.
Never get through old Peg Leg Hood.
SOLDIER 2:
Give me something for the pain!
Give me something for the pain!
Sorry, son, we haven't
got anything to give you.
These animals is driving me crazy!
What luck! You got my jack.
Give me an ace
and I'll start another war.
And I'll bid the moon.
--that I never see you
and my Pa again.
This leg's got to come off.
No, don't! Leave me alone!
I'm sorry, soldier.
-We're all out of chloroform.
-We'll operate without it.
SOLDIER 3: No, no, you won't!
You can't do it.
I won't let you do it!
Tell Dr. Wilson to take this leg off.
It's gangrene.
SOLDIER 3:
No! Oh!
I haven't seen my family in three days.
I'm going home for half an hour.
Orderly, give me a lift!
Nurse, you can free this bed.
FRANK:
Miss Scarlett!
Why, Frank Kennedy.
Miss Suellen. Is she well?
When did they bring you in?
Are you bad hurt?
-Suellen. Is she--?
-She's all right.
Dr. Wilson needs you
in the operating room.
He's gonna take off that leg.
Better hurry.
I'll be back.
SOLDIER 3:
No! You leave me alone! Don't!
I can't stand it! No, don't!
Don't cut! Don't cut!
Don't! Don't! Please!
DR. WILSON:
Where's the nurse?
ORDERLY:
Dr. Wilson's waiting.
Let him wait! I'm going home!
I've done enough!
I don't want any more men dying
and screaming. I don't want any more!
Big Sam!
Big Sam! Big Sam!
Almighty Moses!
It's Miss Scarlett!
Big Sam! Big Sam.
Sam, Elijah, Prophet, Apostle.
I'm so glad to see you.
Tell me about Tara, about my mother.
She didn't write me.
-She gone got sick.
-Sick?
Just a little bit sick, that's all.
Your pa went wild when
they wouldn't let him fight.
He had fits when they took us
to dig the ditch for the soldiers.
Your ma said the Confederacy needs it.
We's digging for the South.
-Was there a doctor?
CAPTAIN: We've got to march.
Don't worry, we'll stop them Yankees.
Goodbye, Big Sam. Goodbye, boys.
If you get sick or hurt,
let me know.
-Goodbye, Miss Scarlett. Goodbye.
SCARLETT: Goodbye. Goodbye.
Scarlett! Scarlett!
Whoa.
Climb into this buggy. This is no day
for walking. You'll get run over!
Oh, Rhett.
Drive me to Aunt Pitty's, please.
Panic's a pretty sight, isn't it?
Whoa, whoa!
Just another of Sherman's calling
cards. He'll pay us a visit soon.
I gotta get out of here
before the Yankees come!
Leave your work at the hospital?
Or have you had enough of death
and lice and men chopped up?
I suppose you weren't meant
for sick men.
Don't talk like that. I'm so scared!
I wish I could get out of here.
Let's get out together.
No use letting the South
come down around your ears.
There are too many nice places
to go and visit.
-Mexico, London, Paris--
-With you?
Yes, ma'am.
With a man who understands
and admires you for what you are.
I figure we belong together,
being the same sort.
I've been waiting for you to grow up
and get Ashley out of your heart.
Well, I hear Mrs. Wilkes is going to
have a baby in another month or so.
It'll be hard loving a man with
a wife and baby clinging to him.
Whoa!
Well, here we are. Are you going
with me or are you getting out?
I hate and despise you, Rhett Butler.
I'll hate and despise you till I die!
Oh, no, you won't, Scarlett.
Not that long.
Miss Scarlett! Miss Scarlett!
Folks is all going to Macon,
and folks is running away!
I can't bear those cannonballs
right in my ears!
I faint every time I hear one.
Uncle Peter, look out for that trunk.
-You aren't leaving?
-I may be a coward...
...but oh, dear! Yankees in Georgia!
How did they ever get in?
I'm going too.
Prissy, go pack my things.
Wait, I won't be a minute.
-Do you really think you ought to?
DR. MEADE: Scarlett!
What is this?
You ain't planning on running away?
Don't try to stop me.
I'm never going back to that hospital.
I've had enough of smelling death,
of rot and death.
I'm going home! I want my mother.
My mother needs me.
Listen to me! You must stay here.
Without a chaperon?
It simply isn't--
Good heavens, this is war,
not a garden party!
-Melanie needs you.
-Oh, bother Melanie!
She's ill already. She shouldn't
even be having a baby.
Can't we take her along?
Want her to be jounced over rough roads
and have the baby ahead of time?
It isn't my baby.
You take care of her!
We haven't enough doctors
to look after a sick woman.
You've got to stay.
What for? I don't know anything
about babies being born.
PRISSY: I knows! I knows!
I knows how to do it.
I's done it lots and lots.
Let me, doctor. Let me.
-I can do everything.
-Good. I'll rely on you to help us.
Ashley's fighting in the field.
Fighting for the Cause.
He may never come back.
He may die.
Scarlett, we owe him
a well-born child.
Ashley.
PITTY:
If you're coming, Scarlett, hurry!
I promised Ashley something....
Then you'll stay?
Good. Go along, Miss Pittypat.
Scarlett's staying.
Go on, Uncle Peter.
I don't know what to do.
It's like the end of the world!
Uncle Peter, my smelling salt!
Melanie, Melanie!
It's all your fault!
I hate you! I hate you!
And I hate your baby!
If only I hadn't promised Ashley.
If only I hadn't promised him!
SCARLETT:
Stop! Stop! Stop! Please, stop.
Are the Yankees coming?
The army's pulling out.
Pulling out and leaving us
to the Yankees?
Not leaving, evacuating. Before
Sherman cuts the McDonough road.
It can't be true!
What'll I do?
Better refugee south, right quick.
If you'll excuse me.
SCARLETT:
Prissy!
Prissy! Go pack my things and
Melanie's too. We're going to Tara.
The Yankees are coming!
MELANIE:
Scarlett! Scarlett!
Melly, we're going to--
Melly....
I'm sorry to be
such a bother, Scarlett.
It began at daybreak.
But-- But--
But the Yankees are coming.
Poor Scarlett.
You'd be at Tara now
with your mother, wouldn't you?
If it weren't for me.
Oh, Scarlett, darling.
You've been so good to me.
No sister could have been sweeter.
I've been lying here thinking...
...if I should die...
...will you take my baby?
Fiddle-dee-dee, Melly.
Aren't things bad enough
without you talking about dying?
-I'll send for Dr. Meade.
-Not yet, Scarlett.
I couldn't let Dr. Meade
sit here for hours...
...while all those poor,
wounded boys....
Prissy! Prissy, Prissy!
Come here, quick!
Go get Dr. Meade. Run! Quick!
The baby.
Don't stand there like
a scared goat. Run!
Hurry, hurry!
I'll sell you south, I will.
I swear I will!
Where's that Prissy?
This room's like an oven already
and it isn't noon yet.
Don't worry, Melly.
Mother says it always seems
like the doctor will never come.
If I don't take a strap to that Prissy!
Oh, Melly....
Know what I heard
about Maybelle Merriwether?
You remember that
funny-looking beau of hers?
The one with the uniform
like ladies' red flannels?
You don't have to keep on
talking for my sake.
I know how worried you are.
For to tote the weary load
No matter, 'twill never....
Oh, Melly....
I'll just go and fetch you
some cooler water.
You're slow as molasses in January.
Where's Dr. Meade?
-I never seen him, Miss Scarlett.
-What?
He ain't at the hospital.
A man told me that the doctor's
down at the car shed...
...with the wounded soldiers--
Well, why didn't you go after him?
Miss Scarlett, I's scared
to go down there at the car shed.
There's folks dying down there.
And I's scared of dead folks!
SCARLETT:
Go sit by Miss Melly.
And don't you be upsetting her
or I'll whip the hide off you.
Just a few more days
For to tote the weary load
SCARLETT: Have you seen--?
SOLDIER: Move aside, lady, please.
Dr. Meade?
SCARLETT:
Dr. Meade.
Dr. Meade, at last!
Thank heaven you're here.
I need every pair of hands.
Now, come, child, wake up.
We got work to do.
But Melly's having her baby.
You've got to come with me!
Are you crazy? I can't
leave these men for a baby.
They're dying! Hundreds!
Get a woman to help.
But there isn't anybody.
Dr. Meade, she might die.
Die? Look at them, bleeding
to death in front of my eyes!
No chloroform. No bandages.
Nothing!
Nothing to ease their pain.
Run along and don't bother me.
Don't worry, child.
There's nothing to bringing a baby.
-Bring the stretchers in here.
MAN: Dr. Meade?
Yeah, I'm coming.
PRISSY:
Is the doctor come?
No, he can't come.
Oh, Miss Scarlett,
Miss Melly bad off.
He can't come.
There's nobody to come.
You've got to manage
without the doctor. I'll help you.
Oh, Lordy, Miss Scarlett!
Well, what is it?
Lordy, we's got to have a doctor!
I don't know nothing
about birthing babies!
-What do you mean?
-I don't know--
You told me
you knew everything!
I don't know why I lied!
Ma ain't never let me around
when folks was having them.
MELANIE:
Scarlett! Scarlett!
PRISSY:
Miss Scarlett!
Stop it!
Go light a fire on the stove.
Boil water in the kettle.
Get me a ball of twine,
clean towels and the scissors.
Don't tell me you can't find them!
Go get them and get them quick!
MELANIE:
Scarlett! Scarlett!
-Scarlett!
-Coming, Melly.
Coming!
MELANIE: You better go
before the Yankees get here.
SCARLETT:
You know I won't leave you.
MELANIE:
It's no use. I'm gonna die.
SCARLETT: Don't be a goose, Melly.
Hold on to me.
-Hold on to me!
-Talk to me, Scarlett.
Please, talk to me.
Don't try to be brave. Yell!
There's nobody to hear.
PRISSY: Ma says if you puts a knife
under the bed, it cuts the pain.
PRISSY:
Captain Butler!
Captain Butler! Captain Butler!
-Who do you want?
-Captain Butler.
He's upstairs.
Belle Watling's giving a party.
PRISSY:
Yes, sir. Thank you.
Captain Butler! Oh, Captain Butler!
What's all the rumpus about?
PRISSY: I's got a message
for Captain Butler, Mrs. Watling.
Captain Butler, you come out here
in the streets to me!
-What is it, Prissy?
-Miss Scarlett done sent me for you.
Miss Melly, she done
had her baby today.
A fine baby boy.
And Miss Scarlett and me,
we brung it.
Are you telling me Scarlett--?
It was mostly me, Captain Butler.
Only Miss Scarlett,
she helped me a little.
But I don't expect no doctor
could have done no better.
Only, Miss Melly, she feel
kind of poorly now it's all over.
Yes, I can believe that.
And the Yankees is coming.
And Miss Scarlett, she says--
Captain Butler, the Yankees is here!
Please come and bring
your carriage for us right away!
I'm sorry, but the army
took my horse and carriage.
You better come upstairs.
I'll see what I can do.
Oh, no, Captain Butler.
Ma would wear me out with a cornstalk
if I was to go into Mrs. Watling's.
Any of you beauties know where
I can steal a horse for a good cause?
Whoa!
SCARLETT: Is that you, Rhett?
PRISSY: We's here, Miss Scarlett!
I knew you'd come.
Nice weather we're having.
Prissy tells me you're--
If you make any jokes now,
I'll kill you!
-Don't tell me you're frightened?
-I'm scared to death!
If you had sense,
you'd be scared too.
-Oh, the Yankees!
-No, not yet.
That's what's left of our army
blowing up the ammunition.
We gotta get out of here!
At your service.
Where are you going?
-Home, to Tara.
-They've been fighting around Tara.
You're going to parade through there
with a sick woman, a baby and a darkie?
Do you intend leaving them?
They're going with me,
and you can't stop me!
It's dangerous jouncing
Mrs. Wilkes over open country.
I want my mother!
I want to go home to Tara!
Tara's probably been burned.
The woods are full of stragglers.
The least they'll do
is take the horse.
It's not much,
but I had trouble stealing it.
I'm going home if I have to walk
every step of the way!
I'll kill you if you try
to stop me! I will, I will!
I will, I will!
Shh, shh, shh.
All right, darling, all right.
Now you shall go home.
I guess anybody who did what you've
done today can take care of Sherman.
Stop crying.
Now blow your nose
like a good little girl. There.
SCARLETT: What're you doing?
-I'm packing!
SCARLETT: Well, stop it
and come and get the baby!
Melly?
-Melly?
RHETT: Mrs. Wilkes?
-We're taking you to Tara.
-Tara?
It's the only way, Melly.
They'll burn the house
over our heads if we stay.
It's all right, Melly.
MELANIE:
My baby.
My poor baby.
-Can you put your arms around my neck?
-I think so.
RHETT:
Never mind.
Ashley, Charles!
What's she want?
Ashley's picture and Charles' sword.
Get them.
SCARLETT:
What's that?
Our gallant lads set fire
to the warehouses.
Enough ammunition in boxcars
to blow us to Tara.
-We have to get across the tracks.
-Not that way!
We have to. McDonough road's the
only one the Yankees haven't cut yet.
Wait, I forgot to lock the front door!
-What are you laughing at?
-At you, locking the Yankees out.
SCARLETT: Oh, dear!
I wish they'd hurry.
RHETT: I wouldn't be in such a hurry
to see them go.
With them goes the last
semblance of law and order.
Scavengers aren't wasting any time.
Better get out of here fast.
SCAVENGER 1:
There's a horse! Get it!
Give us that horse!
Down the alley! Cut him off!
SCAVENGER 2:
Pull that horse!
SCAVENGER 3:
I'll get him!
SCAVENGER 4:
Give me that horse!
PRISSY:
Oh, Miss Scarlett!
RHETT:
Haven't left much to take.
We'll make a dash for it before
the fire reaches that ammunition.
RHETT:
Come on!
Throw me your shawl.
You'll like it better
if you don't see anything.
RHETT:
Come on!
Take a good look, my dear.
It's a historic moment.
Tell your grandchildren how you watched
the Old South disappear one night.
They were gonna lick the Yankees
in a month. The poor gallant fools.
They make me sick.
Getting us all into this
by swaggering and boasting.
That's the way I felt once about
their "swaggering and boasting."
I'm so glad you aren't with the army.
You can be proud. Proud that
you've been smarter than all of them.
I'm not so proud.
Why did you stop?
This is the turn to Tara.
Let the horse breathe a bit.
Mrs. Wilkes.
Miss Melly done fainted
way back, Captain Butler.
She's better off. She couldn't
stand the pain if she were conscious.
Scarlett, are you still determined
to do this crazy thing?
Oh, yes, yes.
I know we can get through, Rhett.
Not we, my dear, you.
I'm leaving you here.
You're what?
Rhett, where are you going?
-I'm going to join the army.
-You're joking.
-I could kill you for scaring me so.
-I'm very serious, Scarlett.
I'm going to join up
with our brave lads in gray.
But they're running away.
They'll turn and make a last stand.
When they do, I'll be with them.
-I'm a little late, but better late--
-You must be joking!
Selfish to the end, aren't you?
Thinking of your own hide,
never a thought for the Cause.
How could you do this to me?
And why should you go now that
it's all over, and I need you?
-Why? Why?
-Why?
I've always had a weakness
for lost causes, once they're really lost.
Or maybe....
Maybe I'm ashamed of myself.
Who knows?
You should die of shame
to leave me alone and helpless!
You? Helpless?
Heaven help the Yankees
if they capture you.
Now climb down here.
-I want to say goodbye.
-No!
Climb down!
Rhett, please don't go!
You can't leave me, please.
I'll never forgive you!
I'm not asking you to forgive me.
I'll never forgive myself.
If a bullet gets me, I'll laugh
at myself for being an idiot.
There's one thing I do know,
and that is I love you, Scarlett.
In spite of you and me and the world
going to pieces, I love you.
Because we're alike.
Bad lots, both of us.
Selfish and shrewd, but able to look
things in the eye and call them by name.
Don't hold me like that!
Scarlett....
Look at me.
I love you more than
I've ever loved any woman.
And I've waited longer
for you than any woman.
Let me alone!
A soldier of the South loves you.
Wants your arms around him.
Wants to carry the memory
of your kisses into battle.
Never mind about loving me.
You're a woman sending a soldier
to his death with a beautiful memory.
Scarlett, kiss me.
Kiss me once.
You low-down, cowardly,
nasty thing, you!
They were right. Everybody was right.
You aren't a gentleman.
A minor point at such a moment.
Here. If anyone lays a hand
on that nag, shoot him.
But don't make a mistake
and shoot the nag.
Go on! I want you to go.
I hope a cannonball blows you
into a million pieces--!
Never mind the rest.
I follow your general idea.
And when I'm dead on the altar of my
country, I hope your conscience irks you.
Goodbye, Scarlett.
Come on, you. We're going home.
Oh, my poor baby.
Don't worry. Mother will take care
of him when we get home.
Miss Scarlett, I's powerful hungry.
-We's got to have something to eat.
-Hush up!
We're nearly at Twelve Oaks.
We'll stop there.
Go on!
Oh, Ashley.
Ashley, I'm glad
you're not here to see this.
The Yankees. The dirty Yankees!
Prissy! Come tie up this cow.
We don't need no cow, Miss Scarlett.
We'll be home soon,
and I's scared of cows.
Tie her onto the back of the wagon
with your petticoat.
We need milk for the baby, and we
don't know what we'll find at home.
SCARLETT:
Melly, we're home!
We're at Tara.
Hurry! Move, you brute!
PRISSY:
Miss Scarlett, it's dead!
SCARLETT:
I can't see the house. Is it there?
I can't see the house.
Have they burned it?
It's all right! It's all right!
They haven't burned it.
It's still there!
Mother! Mother, I'm home!
Mother! Mother, I'm home!
Mother, let me in. It's me. Scarlett!
Oh, Pa!
I'm home.
I'm home.
Katie?
Katie Scarlett!
Oh, darlin'!
Mammy!
Mammy, I'm home.
Honey child....
Mammy, I'm so....
Where's Mother?
Why...
...Miss Suellen, Miss Carreen,
they was sick with the typhoid.
They had it bad,
but they's doing all right now.
-Just weak, like little kittens.
-But where's Mother?
Well....
Miss Ellen. She went down
to nurse that Emmie Slattery...
...that white trash,
and she took down with it too.
Then last night, she--
Mother?
Mother?
Mother?
Mother?
Miss Scarlett, honey.
If there's anything I can do,
Miss Scarlett....
-What did you do with Melly?
-Don't worry your pretty head.
I done slapped her in bed,
along with the baby.
You better put that cow into the barn.
There ain't no barn no more.
-Yankees burned it for firewood.
MAMMY: This was their headquarters.
PORK:
They camped all around.
Yankees in Tara?
Yes'm, and they stole
most everything they didn't burn.
All the clothes and all the rugs,
and even Miss Ellen's rosaries.
I'm starving.
Get me something to eat.
MAMMY: There ain't nothing
to eat, honey. They took it all.
All the chickens? Everything?
They took them first.
What they didn't eat,
they carried off.
Don't tell me any more about
what "they" did!
What's this, Pa?
-Whiskey?
-Yes, daughter.
Katie Scarlett, that's enough.
Your not knowing spirits,
you'll make yourself tipsy.
I hope it makes me drunk.
I'd like to be drunk.
Oh, Pa....
What are those papers?
Bonds.
They're all we've saved,
all we have left.
Bonds.
But what kind of bonds, Pa?
Why, Confederate bonds, of course.
Confederate bonds.
What good are they to anybody?
I'll not have you talking like that.
Oh, Pa, what are we going to do
with no money...
...and nothing to eat?
We must ask your mother.
That's it.
We must ask Mrs. O'Hara.
-Ask Mother?
-Yes.
Mrs. O'Hara will know
what's to be done.
Now don't be bothering me.
Go out for a ride.
I'm busy.
Oh, Pa....
Don't worry about anything.
Katie Scarlett's home.
You needn't worry.
MAMMY: What'll we do with nothing
to feed those sick folks and that child?
I don't know, Mammy.
I don't know.
We ain't got nothing
but radishes in the garden.
PRISSY: Miss Scarlett,
Miss Suellen and Miss Carreen...
...they's fussing to be sponged off.
-Where are the other servants?
-Only just me and Pork left.
The others went to war
or runned away.
PRISSY: I can't take care of
that baby and sick folkses too!
I's only got two hands.
Who's gonna milk that cow,
Miss Scarlett? We's houseworkers.
As God is my witness....
As God is my witness,
they're not going to lick me.
I'm going to live through this,
and when it's all over...
...I'll never be hungry again.
No, nor any of my folk.
If I have to lie, steal,
cheat, or kill...
...as God is my witness,
I'll never be hungry again!
My back's near broken.
Look at my hands!
Mother said you could always
tell a lady by her hands.
I guess things like hands and ladies
don't matter so much anymore.
Rest, Sue. You're not well yet.
I can pick cotton for both of us.
Scarlett's hateful!
Making us work in the fields--
SCARLETT:
Too bad about that.
Get back to work. I can't do
everything at Tara myself.
What do I care about Tara?
I hate Tara!
Don't you ever dare say
you hate Tara again!
It's the same as hating Pa and Ma.
There's something
I must speak to you about.
What is it?
I don't like the way
you're treating Prissy and Mammy.
You must be firm with inferiors,
but gentle with them. Especially darkies.
I know. But I'm not asking them to do
what I don't do myself.
Nevertheless, I don't like it.
I shall speak to Mrs. O'Hara about it.
-What are you doing out of bed?
-I must talk to you.
You're all working so hard.
I can't just lie in bed.
Go upstairs.
You're as weak as a newborn colt.
-Please, let me.
-Stop being noble.
I don't need you making yourself
sick so you'll never be any use.
Oh, I didn't think of it that way.
YANKEE: Who's there?
Halt or I'll shoot!
You all alone, little lady?
You ain't very friendly, are you?
You got anything else
besides these earbobs?
You Yankees have been here before.
Regular little spitfire, ain't you?
What do you got hidden in your hand?
Scarlett, you killed him.
I'm glad you killed him.
CARREEN: Scarlett, what happened?
What is it, Scarlett? What is it?
MELANIE:
Don't be scared!
Your sister was cleaning a revolver
and it went off and scared her.
CARREEN: Thank goodness!
SUELLEN: We got enough to frighten us.
Tell Katie Scarlett
she must be more careful.
What a cool liar you are, Melly.
We gotta get him out of here
and bury him.
If the Yankees find him here--
I didn't see anyone else.
I think he must be a deserter.
Even so, we've gotta hide him.
They might hear about it,
and then they'd come and get you.
I could bury him in the arbor
where the ground is soft...
...but how will I get him
out of here?
-We'll both take a leg and drag him.
-You couldn't drag a cat.
Scarlett....
Would it be dishonest
if we went through his haversack?
I'm ashamed I didn't think
of that myself.
You take the haversack.
I'll search his pockets.
You look. I'm feeling a little weak.
I think it's full of money.
Melly, look. Just look!
Ten, 20, 30--
Don't stop to count it now.
We haven't got time!
Do you realize this means we can eat?
Look in his other pockets.
Hurry, hurry!
We've got to get him out of here.
If he bleeds across the yard,
we can't hide it.
Give me your nightgown.
I'll wad it round his head.
Don't be silly, I won't look at you.
If I had on pantalets, I'd use them.
Thank heavens I'm not that modest.
Now go back to bed.
You'll be dead if you don't.
I'll clean up my mess
when I've buried him.
No, I'll clean it up.
Well, I guess I've done murder.
I won't think about that now.
I'll think about that tomorrow.
GERALD:
Katie Scarlett!
It's over! It's over!
It's all over, the war.
Lee surrendered!
-It's not possible.
-Why did we ever fight?
Ashley will be coming home.
Yes, Ashley will be coming home.
We'll plant more cotton.
Cotton ought to go sky-high next year.
CARPETBAGGER 1 :
The flag that makes you free
So we sing the chorus
From Atlanta to the sea
While we were marching through Georgia
CARPETBAGGER 2:
Get out of the road, rebel!
Have you room for a dying man?
Not for any Southern scum,
alive or dead. Get out of the way!
I reckon he'd rather try
and walk it, at that.
CARPETBAGGER 2:
Jump, you gray-backed beggars!
Acts like they won the war.
You come on, give me
them pants, Mr. Kennedy.
Come on!
Scrub yourself with that lye soap,
'fore I scrub you myself.
I'm gonna put these britches
in the boiling pot.
The whole army's
got the same troubles...
...crawling clothes and dysentery.
It's humiliating how
you're treating him.
You'd be a sight more humiliated
if Mr. Kennedy's lice gets on you.
MELANIE:
Oh, come on, Beau!
We must leave this gentleman alone
because he's tired and he's hungry.
I don't mind, ma'am.
Good to see a youngster again.
Nice little fella.
Another two years, and we could've
had him in Cobb's Legion.
-Were you in Cobb's Legion?
SOLDIER: Yes, ma'am.
Why, then, you must know
my husband, Major Wilkes?
Oh, yes, ma'am. He was captured
at Spotsylvania, I think.
Captured? Oh, thank heaven!
Then he isn't--
-My poor Ashley, in a Yankee prison.
SCARLETT: Melanie?
Yes, Scarlett, I'm coming.
Come along, Beau.
I'll watch out for him.
We're good friends.
Thank you.
I slave day and night
just so we can have enough food...
...and you give it away
to scarecrows.
-I'd sooner have a plague of locusts.
-Don't scold me, Scarlett.
I've just heard that Ashley
was taken prisoner.
-Ashley a prisoner?
-Yes.
And maybe if he's alive and well,
he's on some Northern road right now.
Maybe a Northern woman
is giving him some of her dinner...
...and helping my beloved
to come back home to me.
-I hope so, Melly.
FRANK: Miss Scarlett?
I want to take up something
with your Pa, but he doesn't seem to--
Perhaps I can help you.
I'm head of the house now.
Well, I-- I....
Miss Scarlett, I was aiming
to ask for Suellen.
Are you telling me you haven't asked
for her after all these years?
The truth is, I'm so much
older than she is...
...and now I haven't
a cent to my name.
Who has, nowadays?
Miss Scarlett, if true love
carries any weight with you...
...you can be sure your sister
will be rich in that.
I'd go and get myself a little business,
if we're engaged.
-As soon as I'm on my feet again--
-All right, Frank.
I'm sure I can speak for Pa.
You go ask her now.
Thank you.
Thank you, Miss Scarlett.
Excuse me, Mrs. Wilkes.
Excuse me.
What seems to be
the trouble with Mr. Kennedy?
More trouble than he guesses.
He's finally asked for Suellen's hand.
Oh, I'm so glad.
It's a pity he can't marry her now.
It'd be one less mouth to feed.
Oh, another one!
-Hope this one isn't hungry.
-He'll be hungry.
I'll tell Prissy to get
an extra plate--
Ashley!
Ashley!
Miss Scarlett!
Don't spoil it.
Turn me loose, you fool.
Turn me loose! It's Ashley!
He's her husband, ain't he?
-Miss Scarlett?
-High time you got back.
-Did you get the horse shod?
-Yes'm, he's shod.
Fine thing, horses
get shoes and humans can't.
Here, stir this soap.
Miss Scarlett, ma'am?
I gotta know how much money
have you got left. In gold.
Ten dollars. Why?
That won't be enough.
What are you talking about?
Well, I see'd that old no-count
white-trash Wilkerson...
...that used to be
Mr. Gerald's overseer here.
He's a regular Yankee now,
and he was making a brag...
...that his Carpetbagger friends run
the taxes way up sky-high on Tara.
-How much more we got to pay?
-I hear the taxman say $300.
Three hundred--!
It might just as well be 3 million.
But we gotta raise it, that's all.
Yes'm. How?
-I'll go ask Mr. Ashley.
-He ain't got no $300.
Well, I can ask him
if I want to, can't I?
Asking ain't getting.
Ashley....
They say Abe Lincoln
got his start splitting rails.
Just think what heights I may
climb to, once I get the knack.
Ashley, the Yankees
want $300 more in taxes.
What shall we do?
Ashley, what's to become of us?
What becomes of people
when their civilization breaks up?
Those with brains and courage
come through all right.
Those that haven't are winnowed out.
For heaven's sake...
...don't talk nonsense
when it's us being winnowed out!
You're right, Scarlett. Here I am
talking tommyrot about civilization...
...while your Tara is in danger.
You've come to me for help,
and I've none to give.
Oh, Scarlett, I'm a coward.
You, Ashley? A coward?
What are you afraid of?
Mostly of life becoming
too real for me, I suppose.
Not that I mind splitting rails.
But I do mind very much losing
the beauty of that life I loved.
If the war hadn't come, I'd have spent
my life happily buried at Twelve Oaks.
But the war did come.
I saw my boyhood friends blown to bits.
I saw men crumple up in agony
when I shot them.
And now I find myself in a world
which for me is worse than death.
A world in which there's
no place for me.
I can't make you understand.
You don't know the meaning of fear.
You never mind facing realities.
You never want to escape
from them as I do.
Escape?
Ashley, you're wrong.
I do want to escape too.
I'm so very tired of it all.
I've struggled for food and for money.
I've weeded, hoed and picked cotton
till I can't stand it.
I tell you, the South is dead.
It's dead!
The Yankees and Carpetbaggers
have it and left nothing for us.
Oh, Ashley....
Let's run away.
We'd go to Mexico.
They want officers in the Mexican army.
We'd be happy.
I'd work for you.
I'd do anything for you!
You don't love Melanie. You said
you loved me at Twelve Oaks.
And anyway, Melanie can't--
Dr. Meade said she can't have
more children. I could give you--
Can't we ever forget Twelve Oaks?
You think I could ever forget?
Have you?
Can you honestly say
you don't love me?
-No, I don't love you.
-It's a lie!
Even so, do you think
I'd leave Melanie and the baby?
You couldn't leave
your father and the girls.
I'm sick of them.
I'm tired of them!
Yes, you're sick and tired.
That's why you're talking this way.
You've carried the load
for all of us.
From now on, I'll be more help
to you. I promise.
There's only one way you can help me.
Take me away.
There's nothing to keep us here.
Nothing?
Nothing except honor.
Please, Scarlett.
Please, dear. You mustn't cry.
You mustn't. Please,
my brave dear, you mustn't.
SCARLETT:
You do love me! You do love me!
-No, don't, don't.
-You love me.
We won't do this.
I tell you, we won't do it!
It won't happen again.
I'll take Melanie and go.
-Say it. You love me.
-All right, I'll say it.
I love your courage and stubbornness
so much that I could forget...
...the best wife a man ever had.
But I'm not going to forget her!
Then there's nothing left for me.
Nothing to fight for.
Nothing to live for.
Yes, there is something.
Something you love better than me...
...though you may not know it.
Tara.
Yes.
I still have this.
You needn't go.
I won't have you all starve, simply
because I threw myself at your head.
It won't happen again.
SCARLETT:
It's Emmie Slattery.
-Yes'm, it's me.
SCARLETT: Stop!
You haven't forgotten
your old overseer, have you?
Emmie's Mrs. Wilkerson now.
Get off those steps, you wench!
Get off this land!
You can't speak that way to my wife.
Wife? High time
you made her your wife.
Who baptized your brats
after you killed my mother?
We came out here to pay a call.
A friendly call, and talk business
with old friends.
Friends? When were we ever friends?
Still high and mighty, ain't you?
Well, I know all about you.
Your father's turned idiot.
You can't pay your taxes, and I come
to offer to buy the place from you.
To make you a right good offer.
Emmie wants to live here.
Get off this place, you dirty Yankee!
WILKERSON: You'll see who's running
things when you're sold out for taxes.
I'll buy this place
and I'll live in it!
But I'll wait for the sheriff's sale.
SCARLETT:
That's all of Tara you'll ever get!
You'll be sorry for that.
WILKERSON:
We'll be back!
I'll show you who
the owner of Tara is!
SCARLETT:
Pa, come back!
Pa, come back!
Yankee coward!
SCARLETT:
Pa!
PORK: Lordy, Miss Scarlett,
that's Mr. Gerald's watch!
SCARLETT: You take it. It's for you.
Pa'd want you to have it.
You ain't got no business
parting from this watch now.
You needs all your valuables
to sell for that tax money.
Do you think I'd sell Pa's watch?
And don't cry.
I can stand everybody's
tears but yours.
Oh, Mammy, Mammy!
You've been brave so long.
You just gotta go on being brave.
-Think about your Pa like he used to be.
-I can't think about Pa.
I can't think of anything
but that $300.
Ain't no good thinking about that.
Ain't nobody got that much money.
Nobody but Yankees and Scalawags
got that much money now.
Rhett.
MAMMY:
Who that? A Yankee?
Oh, Mammy, I'm so thin and pale...
...and I haven't any clothes.
Go and get Ma's old box
of dress patterns.
-What you up to?
-You'll make me a new dress.
Not with Miss Ellen's portières!
Great balls of fire!
They're my portières now.
I'm going to Atlanta for $300,
and I've got to look like a queen.
-Who's going with you?
-I'll go alone.
That's what you think!
I's going with you and that new dress.
-Mammy, darling.
-No use to try to sweet talk me.
I knows you since I put
diapers on you.
I said I's going with you,
and going I is!
RHETT: Kings in trade, eh?
Too good for me, major.
It's a pity the war
wasn't a poker game.
You'd done better than Grant,
with far less effort.
What is it?
There's a lady to see Captain Butler.
Says she's his sister.
Another sister?
MAJOR:
This is a jail not a harem, captain.
CORPORAL: No, she ain't one of those.
She's got her mammy with her.
She has?
I'd like to see this one, major.
Without her mammy.
Let's see, my losses for
the afternoon come to what?
Three hundred and forty?
My debts do mount up,
don't they, major?
All right, corporal, show Captain
Butler's "sister" to his cell.
Thank you, major.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
It's hard to be strict with a man
who loses money so pleasantly.
-Rhett!
-Scarlett!
My dear little sister!
It's all right, corporal. My sister
has brought me no files or saws.
Can I really kiss you?
On the forehead, like a good brother.
No, thanks. I'll wait and hope
for better things.
I was so distressed when
I heard you were in jail.
I couldn't sleep for thinking.
It's not true they'll hang you?
Would you be sorry?
-Oh, Rhett.
-Well, don't worry yet.
They trumped up a charge,
but they really want my money.
They think I made off
with the Confederate treasury.
-Well, did you?
-What a leading question.
Let's not talk about things
like money.
How good of you to come and see me.
And how pretty you look!
How you do run on,
teasing a country girl like me.
Thank heavens you're not in rags.
I'm tired of women in rags. Turn around.
You look good enough to eat,
and prosperous.
I've been doing very well.
Everyone's well at Tara, only...
...I got so bored, I thought
I'd treat myself to a visit to town.
You're heartless,
but that's part of your charm.
You've got more charm
than the law allows.
I didn't come to talk
silliness about me.
I was so miserable at the thought
of you in trouble.
I was mad at you when
you left me on the road to Tara.
-And I still haven't forgiven you.
-Don't say that.
Well, I must admit I might not be
alive now, only for you.
When I think of myself
with anything I could possibly hope for...
...not a care in the world,
and you here in this horrid jail.
And not even a human jail,
Rhett, a horse jail!
Listen to me trying to make jokes...
...when I really want to cry.
In a minute I shall cry.
Scarlett....
Can it be possible that--?
Can what be possible, Rhett?
That you've grown a woman's heart?
A real woman's heart.
I have, Rhett. I know I have.
It's worth being in jail
just to hear you say that.
It's well worth it.
You can drop the moonlight
and magnolia.
Things have been going well at Tara?
What've you done with your hands?
-I went riding without my gloves--
-You've been working like a field hand!
Why did you lie,
and what are you up to?
-I almost believed you cared.
-But I do care!
Let's get down to the truth.
You want something enough...
...to put on quite a
show in your velvets.
What is it? Money?
I want $300 to pay the taxes on Tara.
I lied when I said
everything was all right.
Things are as bad as they possibly
could be. And you've got millions.
What collateral do you have?
-My earbobs.
-Not interested.
-Mortgage on Tara.
-What would I do with a farm?
-I'd pay you out of next year's cotton.
-Not good enough.
You once said you loved me.
If you still love me....
You haven't forgotten,
I'm not a marrying man.
No, I haven't forgotten.
You're not worth $300.
You'll never mean anything
but misery to any man.
SCARLETT: I don't care what you say,
only give me the money.
I won't let Tara go! I can't while
there's a breath left in my body.
Oh, Rhett, won't you please
give me the money?
I couldn't if I wanted to.
My funds are in Liverpool,
not Atlanta.
If I drew a draft, they'd be on me
like a duck on a June bug.
So you see, my dear,
you've abased yourself to no purpose.
Here, here. Stop it! You want
the Yankees to see you like this?
Take your hands off me, you skunk!
You knew what I wanted.
You knew you wouldn't lend me
the money and you let me go on!
I enjoyed hearing
what you had to say. Cheer up.
Come to my hanging,
I'll put you in my will.
I'll come to your hanging!
I'm just afraid they won't hang you
in time to pay the taxes on Tara!
BELLE:
Tell him Belle Watling.
Where you been? I thought
you deserted Captain Butler.
I keep myself occupied.
Help me out.
Who that? I ain't never see'd hair
that color before in my life.
You know a dyed-haired woman?
Wish I knew that one.
She'd get my money for me.
Whatever they done
to you in there...
...they didn't do no more than you
deserve for visiting white trash.
MAN 1: Fresh and green.
MAN 2: Right off the farm.
MAN 3: What you doing tonight, Susie?
MAN 4: That's a Georgia peach!
MAN 5:
Nothing like that in Ohio.
CARPETBAGGER:
You know what we'll do?
MAN 6:
What?
We're gonna give every one of you
MAN 7: And a mule?
-Forty acres and a mule!
MAN 7: Gee!
-Because we're your friend.
And you're gonna become voters
and vote like your friends do!
MAN 8: What's your hurry?
MAMMY: What's come over this town?
Yankees have come over it.
Same as they've come over all of them.
MAMMY:
Out of our way, trash!
Get out of the way here!
Get away! Go on.
FRANK:
It can't be Miss Scarlett!
SCARLETT: Frank Kennedy!
FRANK: And Mammy.
MAMMY:
It's good to see home folks.
FRANK: I didn't know you were here.
SCARLETT: I didn't know you were.
Didn't Suellen tell you
about my store?
Did she? I don't remember.
Have you a store?
-This?
-Won't you come in, look around a bit?
I don't suppose
it looks like much to a lady...
...but I can't help being proud of it.
-You're not making money?
-Well, I can't complain.
In fact, I'm mighty encouraged.
Folks tell me
I'm just a born merchant.
Won't be long before
Miss Suellen and I can marry.
-Are you doing as well as all that?
-Yes, I am.
I'm no millionaire yet...
...but I've cleared $1000 already.
SCARLETT:
And lumber too.
-That's only a sideline.
-A sideline, Frank?
With all the good Georgia pine
around Atlanta, and all this building?
Well, all that takes money,
Miss Scarlett...
...and I gotta think
about buying a home.
Why would you want a home?
For Suellen to set up housekeeping.
Here in Atlanta.
You'd want to bring her to Atlanta.
There wouldn't be much help
in that for Tara.
I don't know what you mean.
I don't mean a thing.
How'd you like to drive me
to my Aunt Pitty's?
Nothing'd give me more pleasure.
You better stay to supper.
Aunt Pitty'd be agreeable,
and I'd like a long visit.
You act on me just like a tonic,
Miss Scarlett.
And will you tell me all the news...
...of Miss Suellen?
What's the matter?
Miss Suellen's not ill, is she?
Oh, no, no. I thought
surely she had written you.
I guess she was ashamed to write you.
She should be ashamed.
How awful to have such a mean sister.
You must tell me.
Don't leave me on tenterhooks.
Well, she's going to marry
one of the county boys next month.
She got tired of waiting,
was afraid she'd be an old maid and....
Oh, I'm sorry to be
the one to tell you.
It's cold, and I left my muff at home.
Would you mind if I put my hand
in your pocket?
But, Melanie, you don't realize
what she's done!
She's gone and married
my Mr. Kennedy!
He's my beau and she's married him!
-She did it to save Tara.
-I hate Tara!
SUELLEN: I hate Scarlett! She's
the only thing I hate worse than Tara!
It's all my fault.
I should've committed robbery
to get that tax money for you.
I couldn't let you do
anything like that.
Anyway, it's done now.
Yes, it's done now.
You won't let me do
anything dishonorable...
...yet you'd sell yourself in marriage
to a man you didn't love.
You won't have to worry
about my helplessness anymore.
What do you mean?
ASHLEY:
I'm going to New York.
I've arranged
for a position in a bank.
But you can't do that.
I counted on you to help me start
a lumber business and....
I counted on you.
I don't know anything
about the lumber business.
You know as much as you do
about banking...
...and I'd give you half the business.
That's generous of you, Scarlett.
But it isn't that.
If I go to Atlanta
and take help from you again...
...I'd bury any hope
of ever standing alone.
SCARLETT:
Oh, is that all?
You could gradually buy the business,
and then it would be your own and--
No, Scarlett.
Oh! Ashley!
Ashley!
Scarlett?
Scarlett, what is it?
SCARLETT:
Ashley's so mean and hateful!
MELANIE:
What have you done?
She wanted me to go to Atlanta.
To help me start my lumber business.
And he won't help me!
How unchivalrous of you.
Why, think, Ashley, think!
If it hadn't been for Scarlett,
I'd have died in Atlanta...
...and maybe we wouldn't have
little Beau.
When I think of her picking cotton
and plowing...
...just to keep food in our mouths,
I could just--
Oh, my darling.
All right, Melanie.
I'll go to Atlanta.
I can't fight you both.
GALLEGHER:
Come on, lift them feet!
There's your new mill hands,
Mrs. Kennedy.
The pick of all the best jails
in Georgia.
SCARLETT: They look thin and weak.
GALLEGHER: Halt!
They're the best you can lease.
If you'll give Johnnie Gallegher
a free hand...
...you'll get what you want
out of them.
All right, you're the foreman.
Just keep the mill running
and deliver my lumber when I want it.
GALLEGHER: Johnnie Gallegher's
your man, miss. But remember...
...no questions and no interference.
SCARLETT: That's a bargain.
Start in the morning.
GALLEGHER:
Come on, get a move on there!
But this isn't right, and you know it.
Bad enough to be a businesswoman--
Why do you complain?
You wouldn't own a mill
if I didn't take over.
But I didn't want the mill.
We couldn't buy it if you hadn't
pressed our friends for their debts.
Isn’t that right, Ashley?
Are you running
a charitable institution?
Go back to the store, and go home
and take your medicine.
Sugar, don't you think--?
Great balls of fire! Don't bother me.
And don't call me "sugar."
All right. All right.
Good night, Ashley.
My, my!
She can get mad quicker
than any woman I ever saw.
I don't like to interfere...
...but I wish you'd let me hire
darkies and not use convicts.
We could do better.
Darkies' pay would break us.
Convicts are cheap.
If we give Gallegher a free hand--
A free hand? That means
he'll starve and whip them.
Didn't you see them?
Some are sick.
How you do run on.
If I let you alone,
you'd give them chicken...
...and tuck them in with quilts.
I won't make money out of the
enforced labor and misery of others.
You didn't mind owning slaves.
That was different.
We didn't treat them that way.
I'd have freed them
when father died...
...if the war hadn't
already freed them.
Oh, I'm sorry, Ashley.
Do you forget what it's like
without money?
Money is the most
important thing in the world.
I don't intend to be without it again.
I'll make enough the only way I know
how so the Yankees can't take Tara.
We're not the only Southerners
who've suffered.
Look at all our friends. They're
keeping their honor and kindness.
And they're starving. I've no use
for fools who won't help themselves.
I know what they say about me.
I don't care.
I'll befriend Carpetbaggers
and beat them at their own game.
And you'll beat them with me.
SCARLETT: That's it. Pull it
a little over to that side.
-Afternoon, Mrs. Kennedy.
-Good afternoon.
-Business is certainly growing.
-It certainly is.
You're doing business
with the people...
...who robbed us, tortured us
and left us to starve.
All that's past.
I intend to make the best of things,
even if they are Yankee things.
And do you know that Dr. Meade
actually saw her...
-...peddling lumber to Yankees herself?
-That isn't all.
It's shocking what she's doing
to my brother.
She's even taken to driving
her own buggy.
My dear Mrs. Kennedy.
My very dear Mrs. Kennedy!
I don't see how you have
the gall to face me!
You could've had my millions
if you'd just waited a while.
Oh, how fickle is woman!
What is it you want?
I have things to do.
Will you satisfy my curiosity on a point
which has always bothered me?
Well, what is it?
Tell me, do you never shrink
from marrying men you don't love?
How'd you get out of jail?
Why didn't they hang you?
Oh, that! There's nothing much
that money won't buy.
I observe it's even bought you
the honorable Mr. Wilkes.
So you still hate Ashley Wilkes.
I believe you're jealous of him.
You still think you're the belle of the
county, the cutest trick in shoe leather.
-That every man is in love with you.
-Let me by.
Don't be angry.
Tell me, where are you going?
-I'm going out to the mill.
-Through Shantytown alone?
It's dangerous to drive alone
through all that riffraff.
Don't worry about me.
I can shoot straight,
if I don't have to shoot too far.
What a woman!
Give me a quarter.
Let go of my horse!
ROBBER:
Hold this horse.
-Let go!
-Give me that gun.
Help! Help!
Help!
Help!
Miss Scarlett!
SAM:
Wait!
Miss Scarlett, wait!
Miss Scarlett! Miss Scarlett!
SAM: It's Sam!
-Big Sam?
Miss Scarlett, wait!
Sam! Sam!
Is you hurt, Miss Scarlett?
Did they hurt you?
Don't you cry. Big Sam will get
you out of this in a jiffy.
Horse, make tracks!
Get to Tara as quick
as you can and stay there.
I will. I's had enough
of them Carpetbaggers.
Thank you, Mr. Frank.
Goodbye, Miss Scarlett.
SCARLETT:
Goodbye, Sam. Thank you.
Change your dress and go over
to Miss Melly's.
I've got to go
to a political meeting.
How can you go to a political meeting
after what I've been through?
Oh, sugar.
You're more scared than hurt.
Nobody cares about me.
You all act as though
it were nothing at all.
The men talk
about protecting our women...
...and then after what happened to me,
Frank went to a political meeting.
And if it won't pain you too much,
India Wilkes...
...tell me why you're staring at me.
Has my face gone green?
It won't pain me.
What happened today
was just what you deserved.
With any justice,
you'd have gotten worse.
MELANIE: India, hush up.
-Let her talk. She's always hated me.
Ever since I took Charles away,
though she won't admit it.
If she thought anybody'd notice,
she'd walk the street naked.
I do hate you!
You've done all you could to lower
the prestige of decent people.
Now you've endangered
the lives of our men...
-...because they've got to--
MELANIE: India!
We'd better not say any more,
or one of us will be saying too much.
What's going on
that I don't know about?
Shh!
Somebody's coming up the walk.
Somebody that ain't Mr. Ashley.
Will you hand me the pistol,
Mrs. Meade?
Whoever it is...
...we know nothing.
Where have they gone?
Tell me. It's life or death.
Don't tell him.
He's a Yankee spy.
Quickly. There may be time.
-How'd you know?
-I played poker with Yankees.
They knew there'd be trouble.
They sent the cavalry out.
Your men are walking
into a trap.
Don't tell him.
He's trying to trap you.
Out the Decatur road.
The old Sullivan plantation.
They're meeting in the cellar.
I'll do what I can.
What's this about?
If you don't tell me, I'll go crazy.
MELANIE:
We thought it best not to tell you.
The men have gone to clean out
the woods where you were attacked.
It's what many of our Southern men
have had to do to protect us.
And if they're captured, they'll be
hanged. And it will be your fault.
MELANIE:
Another word and you leave, India.
Scarlett did what she had to do.
Our men are doing
what they think they have to do.
Frank...
...and Ashley.
Oh, it isn't possible.
There's horses, Miss Melly.
Here they come.
We're sewing, we're sewing!
Open the door.
Good evening, Mrs. Kennedy.
Who is Mrs. Wilkes?
I am Mrs. Wilkes.
-I should like to speak to Mr. Wilkes.
-He's not here.
-Are you sure?
-Don't you doubt Miss Melly's word!
I meant no disrespect, Mrs. Wilkes.
If you give me your word,
I won't search the house.
Mr. Wilkes is at a political meeting
at Mr. Kennedy's store.
He's not at the store. There's no
meeting tonight, no political meeting.
We'll wait outside till
he and his friends return.
Surround the house.
Put a man on each door and window.
Keep on with your sewing, ladies.
And I'll read aloud.
"The Personal History and Experience
of David Copperfield.
Chapter One.
I am born.
To begin my life with the beginning
of my life, I record that I was born...."
"Chapter Nine.
I have a memorable birthday.
I pass over all that happened
at school...
...until the anniversary
of my birthday came round in March.
Except that Steerforth was more to be
admired than ever, I remember nothing.
He was going away
at the end of the half-year...
...if not sooner, and was more
spirited and independent than before.
But beyond this,
I remember nothing.
The great--"
"I remember nothing."
Melly, they're drunk!
Leave this to me, Scarlett.
And, please, say nothing.
-You stupid fool!
-Shh!
CAPTAIN:
Quiet!
Will you shut up, for the love of--
Hello, Melly.
So you've got my husband
intoxicated again. Well, bring him in.
I'm sorry,
your husband's under arrest.
If you arrest all the drunks in Atlanta,
you must arrest a good many Yankees.
Bring him in, Captain Butler,
if you can walk yourself.
-Wait.
-I wanna tell you a story.
Listen, doctor, I--
Put him down in that chair.
Now, captain,
please leave my house...
...and try to remember
not to come here again.
That's fine thanks I get
for bringing him home...
...and not leaving him
in this shameful condition.
DR. MEADE:
Now, boys, all together--
Dr. Meade!
I'm astonished at you!
MELANIE:
Oh, Ashley!
How can you do this to me?
I ain't so very drunk, Melly.
Take him to the bedroom.
Lay him out on the bed.
-Don't touch him. He's under arrest.
-Now, Tom.
What do you want to arrest him for?
I've seen him drunker.
I've seen you drunker.
And you've seen me--
He can lie in the gutter for all I care.
I'm not a policeman.
He led a raid on that Shantytown
where Mrs. Kennedy got into trouble.
A lot of shanties were burned.
A couple of men were killed.
It's time you rebels learned you can't
take the law into your own hands.
What are you laughing at?
This isn't your night to teach
that lesson.
These two have been
with me tonight. Yes, sir.
With you, Rhett?
Where?
I don't like to say
in the presence of ladies.
You'd better say.
Come out on the porch
and I'll tell you.
Speak out. I think I have a right
to know where my husband's been.
Well, ma'am...
...we dropped in on a friend of mine...
...and the captain's.
A Mrs. Belle Watling.
We played cards
and drank champagne, and, well....
Now you've done it. Did you have
to show me up in front of my wife?
Now, I hope you're satisfied.
These ladies won't be speaking
with their husbands.
CAPTAIN:
Well, Rhett, I had no idea.
Look here, will you take an oath that
they were with you tonight at Belle's?
Ask Belle if you don't believe me.
She'll tell you.
Will you give me your word,
as a gentleman?
As a gentleman?
Why, certainly, Tom.
Well, if I've made a mistake,
I'm sorry.
I hope you'll forgive me, Mrs. Wilkes.
If you'll leave us in peace.
Well, I say I'm sorry.
Well, I am sorry.
Come on, sergeant.
Lock that door. Pull down the shades.
-Oh!
-Ashley!
He's all right.
It's only in the shoulder.
Get him on the bed
where I can dress the wound.
I think I can walk.
It's not worth the effort.
Which way?
In here.
DR. MEADE:
Mammy, I want hot water.
And lint for bandages.
What can I use for a probe?
If I only had my bag.
Were you really there?
What did it look like?
Does she have cut-glass chandeliers,
plush curtains and dozens of mirrors?
Good heavens, Mrs. Meade,
remember yourself.
Captain Butler, tell me what happened,
all that happened.
I was too late.
When I got to the Sullivan place,
there had already been a skirmish.
I found Mr. Wilkes wounded,
and Dr. Meade was with him.
I had to prove they'd been somewhere,
anyplace but where they were.
-So I took them to Belle's.
-And she took them in?
She's by way of being
an old friend of mine.
Oh, I'm sorry--
I'm sorry I couldn't think up
a more dignified alibi.
This isn't the first time you've come
between me and disaster.
It isn't likely that I'd question
any device of yours.
And now I'll go and see
what Dr. Meade needs.
Oh, Ashley....
Ashley....
Have you no interest in what's
become of your own husband?
Did Frank go with you
to Belle Watling's?
RHETT:
No.
Well, where is he?
He's lying out on Decatur Road...
...shot through the head.
He's dead.
Who is it?
It's Mrs. Watling.
Oh, Mrs. Watling.
Won't you come in the house?
Oh, no, I couldn't do that,
Mrs. Wilkes.
You come in and sit a minute with me.
How can I thank you enough
for what you did for us?
I got your note saying you would
call on me and thank me.
Why, Mrs. Wilkes,
you must have lost your mind.
I came as soon as it was dark to say
you mustn't think of any such thing.
Why, I'm....
Well, you're....
It wouldn't be fitting at all.
It wouldn't be fitting for me to thank
a woman who saved my husband's life?
Mrs. Wilkes, there ain't never been
a lady nice to me like you was.
I mean, about the money
for the hospital.
I don't forget a kindness.
I thought about you being widowed
with a little boy...
...if Mr. Wilkes got hung.
He's a nice little boy,
your boy is, Mrs. Wilkes.
I got a boy myself, so I....
You have? Does he live--?
Oh, no, he ain't here in Atlanta.
He ain't never been here.
He's off at school.
I ain't seen him since he was little.
Anyways, if it had been that
Mrs. Kennedy's husband by hisself...
...I wouldn't have lifted a finger,
no matter what Rhett said.
She's a mighty cold woman...
...prancing about Atlanta by herself.
She killed her husband
same as if she shot him.
You mustn't say unkind things
about my sister-in-law.
Oh.
Please don't freeze me, Mrs. Wilkes.
I forgot how you liked her.
She just ain't in the same class with you,
and I can't help it if I think so.
Well, anyways, I gotta be going.
I'm scared somebody'll recognize
this carriage if I stay any longer.
That wouldn't do you no good.
And, Mrs. Wilkes, if you ever see me
on the street...
...you don't have to speak to me.
I'll understand.
I should be proud to speak to you.
Proud to be under obligation to you.
I hope we meet again.
Oh, no. That wouldn't be fitting.
-Good night, Mrs. Wilkes.
-Good night, Mrs. Watling.
And you're wrong about Mrs. Kennedy.
She's brokenhearted about her husband.
RHETT:
Whoa!
SCARLETT:
Great balls of fire!
It's Rhett.
MAMMY: Captain Butler's here.
I told him you was prostrate with grief.
Tell him I'll be right down, Mammy.
She says she's coming.
I don't know why she's coming,
but she's coming.
You don't like me, Mammy.
Don't you argue with me.
You don't. You really don't.
It's no good, Scarlett.
-What?
-The cologne.
I don't know what you mean.
I mean you've been drinking.
Brandy. Quite a lot.
Well, what if I have?
Is that any of your affair?
Don't drink alone.
People always find out,
and it ruins a reputation.
What is it?
This is more than losing old Frank.
Oh, Rhett, I'm so afraid.
I don't believe it.
You've never been afraid.
I'm afraid now.
I'm afraid of dying and going to hell.
You look pretty healthy.
And maybe there isn't any hell.
Oh, there is. I know there is.
I was raised on it.
Far be it from me to question
the teachings of childhood.
Tell me what you've done
that hell yawns before you.
I ought never to have married Frank.
He was Suellen's beau,
and he loved her, not me.
And I made him miserable,
and I killed him.
Yes, I did. I killed him.
Rhett, for the first time...
...I'm finding out what it is
to be sorry for something I've done.
Here. Dry your eyes.
If you had it all to do over again,
you'd do no differently.
You're like the thief
who isn't sorry he stole...
...but he's terribly sorry
he's going to jail.
I'm glad Mother's dead.
I'm glad she's dead
so she can't see me.
I always wanted to be like her,
calm and kind...
...and sadly, I've turned out
disappointing.
You know, Scarlett, I think
you're on the verge of a crying jag.
So I'll change the subject
and say what I came to say.
Say it, then, and get out!
-What is it?
-I can't go on any longer without you.
Oh! You really are the most ill-bred man
to come here at a time--
I made up my mind you were
the only woman for me...
...the first day I saw you.
Now you have a mill
and Frank's money...
...and won't come to me
as you did to the jail.
-So I see I shall have to marry you.
-I never heard of such bad taste.
Would you be convinced
if I fell to my knees?
Turn me loose and get out.
Forgive me for startling you
with my impetuous sentiments...
...my dear Scarlett--
I mean, my dear Mrs. Kennedy.
But you must have noticed
that for some time...
...the friendship I've felt for you
has ripened into a deeper feeling.
A feeling more beautiful,
more pure, more sacred....
Dare I name it? Can it be love?
Get up off your knees.
I don't like your common jokes.
This is an honorable proposal
of marriage...
...made at what I consider
a most opportune moment.
I can't go all my life waiting
to catch you between husbands.
You're coarse and you're conceited.
And I think this conversation's
gone far enough.
Besides, I shall never marry again.
Oh, yes, you will.
And you'll marry me.
You? You?
I don't love you.
And I don't like being married.
Ever think of marrying
just for fun?
Marriage, fun?
Fiddle-dee-dee!
Fun for men, you mean.
Do you want them to hear you?
You've been married
to a boy and an old man.
Why not try a husband of the right age,
with a way with women?
You're a fool, Rhett Butler...
...when you know I shall always love
another man.
Stop it. You hear me? Stop it.
No more of that talk.
Don't. I shall faint.
I want you to faint.
This is what you're meant for.
None of those fools
have kissed you like this.
Your Charles or your Frank
or your stupid Ashley.
Say you're going to marry me.
Say yes. Say yes.
Yes.
Are you sure you meant it?
You don't want to take it back?
No.
Look at me,
and try to tell me the truth.
Did you say yes because of my money?
Well, yes, partly.
Partly?
Well, you know, Rhett,
money does help.
-And, of course, I am fond of you.
-Fond of me?
If I said I was madly in love
with you, you'd know I was lying.
-You say we have a lot in common--
-Yes, you're right, my dear.
I'm not in love
any more than you are.
Heaven help the man
who ever really loves you.
What kind of ring would you like?
A diamond ring,
and do buy a great big one.
You'll have the biggest
and most vulgar ring in Atlanta.
I'll take you to New Orleans
for the most expensive honeymoon.
-That'd be heavenly.
-I'll buy your trousseau for you too.
How wonderful...
...but you won't tell anybody,
will you?
Still the little hypocrite.
Won't you kiss me goodbye?
You've had enough kissing
for one afternoon.
You're impossible. You can go.
I don't care if you never come back.
But I will come back.
What are you thinking about, Scarlett?
I'm thinking about how rich we are.
I can keep the lumber business too?
Yes, of course you can,
if it amuses you.
Now that you're so rich, you can tell
everybody to go to the devil.
But you were the main one
I wanted to go to the devil.
Don't scrape the plate.
I'm sure there's more in the kitchen.
Oh, Rhett, can I have
a chocolate one stuffed with meringue?
If you don't stop being a glutton,
you'll get as fat as Mammy.
And I'll divorce you.
RHETT: It'd be nice if you bought
something for Mammy.
Why should I buy her a present
when she called us both mules?
Mules? Why mules?
She said we could give ourselves air
and get slicked up like racehorses...
...but we were just mules in horse
harness and we didn't fool anybody.
I never heard anything more true.
Mammy's a smart old soul.
And one of the few people I know
whose respect I'd like to have.
-I won't give her a thing.
-Then I'll take her a petticoat.
My mammy said
when she went to heaven...
...she wanted a red taffeta petticoat
so stiff that it'd stand by itself...
...and so rustley the Lord would say
it's made of angels' wings.
She won't take it from you.
She'd rather die than wear it.
That may be. But I'm making
the gesture just the same.
RHETT:
Wake up. Wake up!
You were having another nightmare.
Oh, Rhett.
Rhett, I was so cold
and hungry and so tired.
I couldn't find it. I ran through
the mist and I couldn't find it.
-Find what, honey?
-I don't know.
I always dream the same dream,
and I never know.
It seems to be hidden in the mist.
Darling....
Oh, Rhett, do you think I'll ever dream
that I found it, and that I'm safe?
Dreams don't work that way.
But when you get used
to being safe and warm...
...you'll stop dreaming that dream.
And, Scarlett, I'm going to see
that you are safe.
Rhett, would you do something for me
if I asked you?
You know I would.
Will you take me away from here?
-Don't you like New Orleans?
-I love New Orleans...
...but I want to go home
and visit Tara.
Will you take me to Tara?
Yes, Scarlett. Of course I will.
We'll go tomorrow.
You get your strength
from this red earth of Tara.
You're part of it
and it's part of you.
I'd give anything to have Tara
the way it was before the war.
Would you?
Go ahead and make it that way.
Spend whatever you want.
Make it as fine a plantation
as it ever was.
Oh, Rhett!
Rhett, you are good to me.
Can we still have our big new house
in Atlanta?
Yes. And it can be
as ornate as you want.
Marble terraces,
stained-glass windows.
Won't everyone be jealous!
I want everybody who's been mean
to me to be pea-green with envy.
I don't care. Scarlett's hateful...
...building that new house
just to show off!
And even taking our servants!
Oh, darling, you mustn't think
unkindly of her.
She's made it possible for us
to keep Tara, always.
Yes, and what good is Tara?
She's had three husbands,
and I'll be an old maid!
PORK:
Great Jehoshaphat!
Great Jehoshaphat!
Lordy, we sure is rich now.
RHETT: That's ridiculous!
Why can't I go in?
I'm entitled to at least see
what my own child looks like.
You control yourself.
You'll be seeing it for a long time.
I'd like to apologize
about its not being a boy.
Oh, hush your mouth.
Who wants a boy?
Boys aren't any use.
Don't you think I'm proof of that?
Have a drink of sherry.
Mammy, she is beautiful, isn't she?
She sure is.
You ever see a prettier one?
Miss Scarlett was mighty near that
pretty when she come, but not quite.
Have another glass.
Mammy?
What's that rustling noise I hear?
Lordy, that ain't nothing but my
red silk petticoat you done give me.
Nothing but your petticoat?
I don't believe it. Pull up your skirt.
Mr. Rhett, you is bad.
Yea, Lordy!
You sure took a long enough time
about wearing it.
Yes, sir. Too long.
No more mule in horse's harness?
Mister Rhett, Miss Scarlett
was bad telling you about that.
You ain't holding that
against old Mammy, is you?
I don't hold it against you.
I just wanted to know.
Have another glass.
Here, take the whole bottle.
Dr. Meade says you can go in now,
Captain Butler.
This sure is a happy day to me.
I done diapered three generations
of this family's girls.
And it sure is a happy day.
Oh, yes, Mammy. The happiest days
are when babies come. I wish--
Oh, Mammy, she's beautiful.
What do you suppose they'll name her?
Miss Scarlett done told me
if it was a girl...
...she was going to name it
Eugenia Victoria.
RHETT:
Yes, she's a beautiful baby.
The most beautiful baby ever.
Yes....
Do you know that this is
your birthday?
That you're a week old today?
Yes, I'm going to buy her a pony,
the likes of which...
...this town has never seen.
Yes, I'm going to send her to
the best schools in Charleston.
Yes, and her will be received by
the best families in the South.
And when it comes time
for her to marry...
...well, she'll be a little princess.
Certainly making a fool of yourself.
Why shouldn't I?
She's the first person who's ever
completely belonged to me.
Great balls of fire!
I had the baby, didn't I?
MELANIE: It's Melanie. May I come in?
-Come in.
Yes, come in and look at
my daughter's beautiful blue eyes.
Most babies have blue eyes
when they're born.
Don't tell him anything.
He knows everything about babies.
Nevertheless, her eyes are blue
and they'll stay blue.
As blue as the Bonnie Blue flag.
That's it.
That's what we'll call her.
"Bonnie Blue Butler."
Try again, Mammy.
Twenty inches.
Twenty inches.
I've grown as big as Aunt Pitty.
You simply gotta make it 18 1/2 again.
You done had a baby.
And you ain't never gonna be
no 18 1/2 inches again.
There ain't nothing to do about it.
There is something to do about it.
I'm just not going to get old and fat
before my time.
I just won't have any more babies.
I heard Mr. Rhett say
that he'd be wanting a son next year.
Tell Captain Butler I decided
not to go out.
I'll have supper in my room.
I got your message.
I'll have them bring
my supper up here too.
No objections to that, I hope?
No.
Yes. Uh....
I mean, I don't care
where you have your supper.
Rhett....
RHETT: Yes?
-You see....
Well, I've decided....
Well, I hope I don't have
any more children.
My pet, as I told you
before Bonnie was born...
...it's immaterial to me
whether you have one child or 20.
No, but you know what I....
Do you know what I mean?
I do. And do you know
I can divorce you for this?
You're low enough to think of that.
If you had any chivalry in you,
or were nice....
Look at Ashley Wilkes. Melanie can't
have any more children and he....
You've been to the lumber office
this afternoon.
What has that got to do with it?
Quite the little gentleman, Ashley.
Pray, go on, Mrs. Butler.
It's no use. You wouldn't understand.
-You know, I'm sorry for you, Scarlett.
-Sorry for me?
Yes, sorry for you because you throw
away happiness with both hands...
...and reach out for something
that'll never make you happy.
I don't know
what you're talking about.
If you were free and Melly were dead
and you had your precious Ashley...
...do you think you'd be happy?
You'd never know him,
never even understand his mind...
...any more than you understand
anything, except money.
Never mind about that. I want--
You may keep your sanctity.
It'll work no hardship on me.
You don't care?
The world is full
of many things and people...
...and I shan't be lonely.
I will find comfort elsewhere.
Well, that's fine.
But I warn you, in case you change
your mind, I intend to lock my door.
Why bother?
If I wanted to come in,
no lock could keep me out.
I knew most women were cheats...
...hypocritical and hard,
but this one....
-It ain't no use.
-What do you mean?
I mean you're poisoned with her.
I don't care what she's done to you.
You're still in love with her.
-It pleasures me none to say it.
-Maybe so, but I'm through with her.
You've gotta think of the child.
Child's worth 10 of the mother.
You're a shrewd woman, Belle.
And a very nice one.
Yes, Rhett?
I was just thinking of the difference
between you and....
You're both hardheaded businesswomen,
and successful.
But you've got a heart, Belle.
And you're honest.
Goodbye, Rhett.
Goodbye, Belle.
RHETT:
She'll be a wonderful horsewoman.
Look at those hands. And that seat!
SCARLETT:
Oh, fiddle-dee-dee!
Why we have to wheel a baby
when we have servants--
-Good morning, Mrs. Merriwether.
MERRIWETHER: Captain Butler.
Good morning, Scarlett.
Making fools of ourselves
in front of these buffaloes.
If you'd thought of your position,
you wouldn't have to.
But as it is, we're going to cultivate
every female dragon of the Old Guard--
-Good morning, Mrs. Whiting.
WHITING: Captain Butler.
Good morning, Scarlett.
So the millionaire speculator
is turning respectable.
Money can't buy
what I want for Bonnie.
I'll admit I've been at fault too.
Bonnie will have a place
among decent people.
Even if we both have to crawl
on our bellies to every fat old cat--
Good morning, Mrs. Meade.
MRS. MEADE: Good morning, Captain
Butler. Good morning, Scarlett.
RHETT: Mrs. Merriwether, I have
great regard for your knowledge.
-Could you give me some advice?
-Why, certainly.
My Bonnie sucks her thumb.
I can't stop her.
You should make her stop!
It'll ruin the shape of her mouth.
I know, I know.
She has such a beautiful mouth too.
-I tried putting soap on her nails.
MERRIWETHER: Soap? Bah!
Put quinine on her thumb and
she'll stop sucking it quick enough.
Quinine! I never would have
thought of it.
I can't thank you enough.
You've taken a great load off my mind.
Good morning.
Good morning, Dolly.
Wasn't that Captain Butler?
Good morning, Caroline.
I was just thinking...
...there's a great deal of good in
a man who would love a child so much.
But of course there is.
Fanny Elsing told Dr. Meade that
Captain Butler finally admitted...
...that he was honored for his
services at the Battle of Franklin.
No, and did I tell you
that Captain Butler made...
...a stupendous contribution to the
Association for the Beautification...
-...of the Graves of the Glorious Dead?
-No!
My grandbaby, Napoleon Picard,
is giving a party for Bonnie next week.
Why, Dolly Merriwether, it was
my idea to give a party for Bonnie.
Why, Caroline Meade,
how can you say a thing like that?
RHETT: Watch Daddy put your pony
over it, Bonnie. Now, watch!
Daddy, let me! Let me!
All right, darling.
Put her on, Pork.
Up we go!
Oh, there!
Lordy mercy!
There he goes again.
RHETT: Grip tightly with your legs.
Lean forward and go with him.
Hold your reins properly
in a firm hand. Up!
That was fine. I knew you'd do it.
When you're older,
I'll take you to Kentucky and Virginia.
You'll be the best horsewoman
in the South. Give your daddy a kiss.
MAMMY:
Mr. Rhett? Mr. Rhett!
Mr. Rhett!
Did you see her?
Wasn't she wonderful?
Mr. Rhett, I done told you
and told you...
...it just ain't fittin' for a girl to ride
astraddle with her dress flying up.
All right. I'll teach her
to ride sidesaddle.
And I'll buy her a blue velvet
riding habit. She'll love that.
A nice black broadcloth
is what little girls wear.
Oh, now, Mammy,
be reasonable.
Well, I don't think it's fittin', but....
It ain't fittin', it just ain't fittin'.
It ain't fittin'.
ASHLEY: Why, Scarlett, what are you
doing downtown at this time of day?
Well, Ashley, I just--
Why aren't you helping Melly
with my surprise birthday party?
Why, Ashley Wilkes, you aren't
supposed to know anything about that.
Melly'd be so disappointed
if you weren't surprised.
I won't let on.
I'll be the most surprised man
in Atlanta.
As long as you're here,
let me show you the books...
...so you can see how bad
a businessman I am.
Don't let's fool with any books today.
When I'm wearing a new bonnet...
...all the figures I ever knew
go right out of my head.
Figures are well lost when
the bonnet's as pretty as that.
Scarlett, you know,
you get prettier all the time.
You haven't changed a bit since
our last barbecue at Twelve Oaks...
...where you sat under a tree
surrounded by dozens of beaus.
That girl doesn't exist anymore.
Nothing's turned out as I expected,
Ashley. Nothing.
Yes, we've traveled a long road
since the old days, haven't we?
Oh, the lazy days...
...the warm, still,
country twilight...
...the high, soft Negro laughter
from the quarters...
...the golden warmth and security
of those days.
Don't look back, Ashley.
Don't look back.
It drags at your heart till...
...you can't do anything
but look back.
I didn't mean to make you sad,
my dear.
I never want you to be anything
but completely happy.
Oh, Ashley!
-Who is it?
RHETT: Only your husband.
Come in.
Am I actually being invited
into the sanctuary?
You're not ready for Melanie's party.
I've got a headache, Rhett.
You go without me
and make my excuses to Melanie.
What a white-livered
little coward you are!
Get up! You're going to that party
and you'll have to hurry.
-Has India dared--?
-Yes, India has.
-Everyone in town knows the story.
-Kill them for spreading lies.
I don't kill people who tell the truth.
No time to argue.
I won't go! I can't go until
this misunderstanding clears up.
You won't cheat Melly out of publicly
ordering you out of her house.
There was nothing wrong.
India hates me so. I can't go.
If you don't show your face tonight,
you'll never be able to again.
I don't care, but you won't ruin
Bonnie's chances.
You're going to that party,
for her sake. Get dressed.
Wear that. Nothing modest
or matronly will do for this occasion.
And put on plenty of rouge.
I want you to look your part tonight.
GUESTS :
For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow
Which nobody can deny
Which nobody can deny
Which nobody can deny
-Good night, Scarlett.
-But, Rhett--
You're going into the arena alone.
The lions are hungry.
Don't leave me. Don't.
You're not afraid?
MELANIE:
What a lovely dress, darling.
India wasn't able to come.
Will you be an angel?
I do need you to help me
receive my guests.
Mrs. Meade...
...here's our darling Scarlett.
-Good evening.
-Good evening.
-Why, Scarlett.
-Good evening.
Ashley, aren't you going to get
our Scarlett a glass of punch?
MAMMY: Did you have a good time
at Miss Melly's party?
Yes. Now, Mammy,
be sure and leave word.
If Captain Butler asks for me
when he comes back, I'm asleep.
Yes'm.
RHETT:
Come in, Mrs. Butler.
Come here.
Sit down.
No reason you shouldn't
have a nightcap, even if I am here.
I didn't want a drink.
I heard a noise--
You heard nothing of the kind.
You wouldn't have come
if you thought I was here.
-You must need a drink badly.
-I do not.
Take it. Don't give yourself airs.
I know you drink on the quiet,
and I know how much you drink.
Do you think I care
if you like your brandy?
-You're drunk and I'm going to bed.
-I'm very drunk...
...and I intend getting still drunker
before the evening's over.
But you're not going to bed.
Not yet.
Sit down.
So she stood by you, did she?
How's it feel to have the woman
you've wronged cloak your sins?
You're wondering if she knows
all about you and Ashley.
You're wondering if she did it
just to save face.
You're thinking she's a fool for doing it,
even if it saved your hide--
-I will not listen.
-Yes, you'll listen.
Miss Melly's a fool,
but not the kind you think.
She has too much honor to conceive
of dishonor in anyone she loves.
And she loves you.
Though just why she does,
I'm sure I don't know.
If you weren't so drunk and insulting,
I could explain everything.
-As it is, though--
-You get out of that chair once more....
Of course, the comic figure in all this
is the long-suffering Mr. Wilkes.
Mr. Wilkes, who can't be
mentally faithful to his wife...
...and won't be unfaithful to her
technically.
-Why doesn't he make up his mind?
-Rhett, you--
Observe my hands, my dear.
I could tear you to pieces with them.
And I'd do it if it'd take
Ashley out of your mind forever.
But it wouldn't.
So I'll remove him
from your mind forever, this way.
I'll put my hands so.
One on each side of your head.
And I'll smash your skull
between them like a walnut.
And that'll block him out.
Take your hands off me,
you drunken fool!
You know, I've always admired
your spirit, my dear.
Never more than now,
when you're cornered.
I'm not cornered.
You'll never corner me or frighten me.
You've lived in dirt so long,
you can't understand anything else.
You're jealous of something
you can't understand.
Good night.
RHETT:
Jealous, am I?
Yes, I suppose I am.
Even though I know you've been
faithful to me all along.
How do I know?
Because I know Ashley Wilkes
and his honorable breed.
They're gentlemen.
That's more than I can say
for you or for me.
We're not gentlemen.
And we have no honor, have we?
It's not that easy, Scarlett.
You turn me out while you chase Ashley,
while you dream of Ashley.
This is one night
you're not turning me out.
How are you feeling this morning?
Well, this misery in my back...
...ain't so good.
You act mighty happy this morning.
I am, Mammy. I am.
Oh, she wept with delight
When he gave her a smile
And trembled with fear at his frown
RHETT:
Hello.
I, um....
I'd like to extend my apology
for my conduct of last night.
Oh, but, Rhett.
I was very drunk...
...and quite swept off my feet
by your charms.
You needn't bother to apologize.
Nothing you do surprises me.
I've been thinking, and I believe
it would be better for both of us...
...if we admitted we made a mistake
and got a divorce.
-A divorce?
-Yes.
There's no point in holding on
to each other.
I'll provide for you.
You've plenty of grounds.
Just give me Bonnie,
and you can say what you please.
Thank you, but I wouldn't dream of
disgracing the family with a divorce.
You'd disgrace it
if Ashley were free.
Makes my head spin to think
how quickly you'd divorce me.
Wouldn't you?
Answer me. Wouldn't you?
Please go now and leave me alone.
I'm going. That's what I came
to tell you.
I'm going on a very extended trip
to London.
-And I'm leaving today.
-Oh.
I'm taking Bonnie with me.
Please get her duds packed right away.
You'll never take my child
out of this house.
She's my child too. You're mistaken
if you think I'm leaving her here...
...with a mother who doesn't
consider her reputation.
You're a fine one to talk.
You think I'll let her out when you'll
have her around people like Belle?
If you were a man,
I'd break your neck for that.
I'll thank you to shut your mouth.
As for you giving yourself airs
about motherhood...
...a cat's a better mother
than you are.
Have her things packed for me
in an hour, or I warn you...
...I've always thought a lashing with
a whip would benefit you immensely.
Excuse me, Mr. Rhett.
-Hello, Uncle Rhett.
-Hello, Beau.
Daddy, where have you been?
I've been waiting for you all morning.
I've been hunting for a rabbit skin
to wrap my little Bonnie in.
Give your best sweetheart a kiss.
Bonnie, I'm going to take you
on a long trip to fairyland.
Where? Where?
I'll show you the Tower of London,
where the little princes were...
...and London Bridge.
London Bridge?
Will it be falling down?
Well, it will
if you want it to, darling.
BONNIE :
Daddy, dark!
Dark!
RHETT:
Bonnie! Bonnie!
It's all right, Bonnie.
Who put out that light? Nurse!
BONNIE: Daddy, dark!
RHETT: Yes, yes, yes....
What's the matter with my Bonnie?
BONNIE:
A bear!
Oh, a bear? A big bear?
BONNIE:
Dreadful big!
And he sat on my chest!
I'll stay here and shoot him
if he comes back.
NURSE:
Oh, good evening, Mr. Butler.
I told you never to leave
this child alone in the dark.
Children are often afraid of the dark,
but they get over it.
Let her scream for a night--
Let her scream?
Either you're a fool
or an inhuman woman.
If you want her to grow up cowardly--
Cowardly? There isn't
a cowardly bone in her body.
You're discharged.
As you say, sir.
Where's Mother?
Bonnie....
Aren't you happy here
in London with me?
I wanna go home.
Miss Bonnie! And Captain Butler!
Miss Scarlett!
BONNIE:
Hello, Mammy!
MAMMY:
Honey child!
Miss Scarlett, they's back.
They's back!
Bonnie! Bonnie, baby.
Darling baby!
You glad to be home?
Daddy gave me a kitten.
But London's a horrid place.
Where's my pony?
I wanna go out and see my pony.
You go out and see your pony.
BONNIE:
Where's my pony?
I want to go out and see my pony.
You run along with Mammy.
Come on, honey child.
Mammy sure missed you, honey.
Mrs. Butler, I believe.
Mammy said you'd come back.
Only to bring Bonnie.
Apparently any mother,
even a bad one, is better than none.
You mean you're going away again?
What perception, Mrs. Butler.
Right away.
-In fact, I left my bags at the station.
-Oh.
You're looking pale.
Is there a shortage of rouge?
Or can this wanness mean
you've been missing me?
If I'm pale, it's your fault.
Not because I've been
missing you, but because....
Pray continue, Mrs. Butler.
It's because I'm going to have a baby.
Indeed. And who's the happy father?
You know it's yours.
I don't want it any more than you do.
No woman would want the child
of a cad like you.
I wish it were anybody's
child but yours!
Well, cheer up.
Maybe you'll have an accident.
Is she better?
Has she asked for me?
Don't you understand?
She's delirious.
Rhett....
I want Rhett!
MAMMY: What's the matter, honey?
Did you call somebody, child?
It's no use. It's no use!
Dr. Meade's left.
-Scarlett's dead.
-Oh, no, she's much better.
Really she is.
There, there, Captain Butler,
you're beside yourself.
She'll very soon be well again.
I promise you.
She never wanted this baby.
Not want a baby?
Why, every woman wants a baby.
You do, but she doesn't.
Not my children.
She told me she didn't want any more.
I wanted to hurt her because
she'd hurt me. And I did.
You mustn't tell me these things.
It's not fair to--
I didn't know about this baby
until she fell.
If I'd only known,
I'd have come straight home.
Well, of course you would.
And then when she told me
there on the steps, what did I do?
What did I say?
I laughed and I said--
But you didn't mean it.
I know you didn't mean it.
But I did mean it.
I was crazy with jealousy.
She's never cared for me. I tried
to make her care, but I couldn't.
You're so wrong.
Scarlett loves you a great deal.
Much more than she knows.
If that were true, I'd wait forever.
If she'd only forgive me.
She will. You must be patient.
No, it's not possible. If you
only knew who she really loved--
You wouldn't believe it.
Surely you haven't
listened to idle gossip.
No, Captain Butler.
I wouldn't believe it.
There, there. Scarlett's going to get well,
and there can be other babies.
She couldn't even if she wanted to.
But of course she could!
I'm going to.
No, Miss Melly, you mustn't risk it.
It's too dangerous.
Children are life renewing itself,
Captain Butler.
And when life does that,
danger seems very unimportant.
I've never before known anyone
who was really brave.
I pray God things go well
with you, Miss Melly.
And I want to thank you for all
you've done for me and for Scarlett.
From my heart, I thank you.
Miss Scarlett's feeling
a heap better today, Mr. Rhett.
Thank you, Mammy.
I've come to ask your forgiveness...
...hoping our life together
has another chance.
Our life together? When did we
ever have a life together?
Yes, you're right.
But I'm sure if we could only
try again, we could be happy.
What is there
to make us happy now?
Well, there's Bonnie...
...and I love you, Scarlett.
When did you discover that?
I've always loved you, but you've
never given me a chance to show it.
And just what do you want me to do?
To begin with, give up the mill,
Scarlett. We'll go away.
We'll take Bonnie
and have another honeymoon.
Give up the mill?
It's making more money than ever.
I know, but we don't need it.
Sell it.
Or give it to Ashley.
Melanie's been such a friend to us.
Melanie!
If you'd only think more about me!
I am thinking of you.
And I'm thinking that, well...
...maybe the mill's taking you
away from me and Bonnie.
I know what you're thinking.
Don't bring Bonnie into it.
-You're taking her away from me.
-But she loves you.
You've made her love you and not me.
She's so spoiled now, that--
Mommy, Daddy! Watch me.
SCARLETT:
We're watching, darling.
You're mighty pretty, precious.
So are you.
I'm going to jump.
Watch me, Daddy.
I don't think you ought
to do much jumping yet.
You just learned
to ride sidesaddle.
I will so jump.
I can jump better than ever,
because I've grown.
I moved the bar higher.
Don't let her do it, Rhett.
No, Bonnie, you can't.
If you fall off,
don't cry and blame me!
Rhett, stop her.
Bonnie!
Bonnie!
She's just like Pa.
Just like Pa...!
Bonnie! Bonnie!
Bonnie!
Bonnie!
Lordy, Miss Melly.
I sure is glad you's come.
Oh, Mammy, this house won't seem
the same without Bonnie.
How's Miss Scarlett bearing up?
Miss Melly, this here's
done broke her heart.
I didn't fetch you
on Miss Scarlett's account.
What that child got to stand, the good
Lord give her strength to stand.
It's Mr. Rhett I's worried about.
He done lost his mind
these last couple of days.
Oh, no, Mammy, no.
I ain't never seen no man, black or white,
set such store on any child.
When Dr. Meade say her neck broke...
...Mr. Rhett grabbed his gun and run
out and shoot that poor pony.
And for a minute,
I think he gonna shoot hisself.
Oh, poor Captain Butler.
Miss Scarlett called him a murderer
for teaching that child to jump.
She said, "You give me my baby
what you killed."
And then he say Miss Scarlett ain't
never cared nothing about Miss Bonnie.
It like to turn my blood cold,
the things they say to one another.
Stop, Mammy, don't tell me any more.
And then that night...
...Mr. Rhett, he locked hisself
in the nursery with Miss Bonnie.
He wouldn't open the door when
Miss Scarlett beat on it and hollered.
And that's where he's been
for two whole days.
Oh, Mammy!
This evening, Miss Scarlett shouted
through the door and said:
"The funeral's set for tomorrow."
He says, "You try that,
and I kills you tomorrow.
Do you think I's gonna put my child
in the dark when she's so scared of it?"
Oh, Mammy, Mammy!
-He has lost his mind!
-Yes'm, that's the God's truth.
He ain't gonna let us bury
that child. You gotta help us.
Oh, but I can't intrude.
If you can't help us, who can?
Mr. Rhett always set great store
by your opinion.
Please, Miss Melly.
I'll do what I can, Mammy.
RHETT: Get away from that door
and leave us alone.
MELANIE:
It's Mrs. Wilkes, Captain Butler.
Please let me in.
I've come to see Bonnie.
Oh, Lord, please help Mr. Rhett
in this hour of his grief.
Mammy....
I want you to make a good deal
of strong coffee...
...and bring it up to Captain Butler.
I'll go and see Miss Scarlett.
But....
Captain Butler's willing for the funeral
to take place tomorrow morning.
Hallelujah! I expect the angels
fights on your side, Miss Melly.
Miss Melly! Miss Melly! Miss Melly!
Miss Melly. Miss Melly.
Send for Dr. Meade, Mammy.
And try....
Try to get me home.
Miss Melly! Miss Melly!
BEAU:
Where is my mother going away to?
And why can't I go along, please?
We can't always go along, Beau,
as much as we may want to.
You're going back to bed now.
Oh, Rhett, she can't be dying.
She can't be.
She hasn't your strength.
She's never had any.
-She's never had anything but heart.
-You knew that too?
Why do I have to go back to bed?
It's morning.
It isn't really morning yet.
You may come in now, Scarlett.
Dr. Meade, please let me see her.
I've been waiting here two days.
I've got to tell her
that I was wrong about something.
She knows you were wrong.
She wants to see Scarlett.
Miss Melly's going to die in peace.
Don't ease your conscience...
...telling her things that make
no difference now. You understand?
It's me, Melly.
Promise me?
Anything.
Look after my little son.
I gave him to you once before.
Remember?
The day he was born.
Please, Melly, don't talk this way.
I know you'll get well.
Promise me...college.
Yes, and Europe, and a pony.
Whatever he wants, but...
...oh, Melly, do try.
Ashley....
Ashley and you....
What about Ashley, Melly?
Look after him for me...
...just as you looked after me...
...for him.
I will, Melly.
Look after him...
...but never let him know.
Good night.
Promise?
What else, Melly?
Captain Butler.
-Be kind to him.
-Rhett?
He loves you so.
Yes, Melly.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
You ladies may come in now.
Rhett....
Ashley!
I don't know where
the mate to this is.
She must've put it away.
Stop it! Hold me. I'm so frightened!
I'm so frightened!
Scarlett, what can I do?
I can't live without her. I can't!
Everything I ever had
is going with her.
Oh, Ashley....
You really love her, don't you?
She's the only dream I ever had
that didn't die in the face of reality.
Dreams. Always dreams with you.
Never common sense.
Scarlett, if you knew what
I've gone through!
Ashley, you should've told me years
ago that you loved her and not me.
And not left me dangling
with your talk of honor.
But you had to wait till now,
now when Melly's dying...
...to show me that I could never
mean any more to you...
...than this Watling woman
does to Rhett.
And I've loved something
that doesn't really exist.
But somehow...
...I don't care.
Somehow, it doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter one bit.
Oh, Ashley....
Ashley, forgive me.
Don't cry. She mustn't see
you've been crying.
Ashley!
ASHLEY:
Melly!
Melly!
Rhett! Rhett!
Rhett, where are you?
Rhett, wait for me!
Rhett, wait for me!
Rhett!
Rhett!
Rhett!
Rhett!
Rhett!
Rhett!
Rhett!
Rhett!
Come in.
Rhett....
Melanie, she's...?
Well, God rest her.
She was the only completely
kind person I ever knew.
A great lady. A very great lady.
So she's dead. That makes it
nice for you, doesn't it?
How can you say such a thing?
You know how I loved her, really.
No, I don't know that I do.
It's to your credit that
you could appreciate her.
Of course I appreciated her.
She thought of everybody except herself.
-Why, her last words were about you.
-What did she say?
She said, "Be kind to Captain Butler...
...he loves you so."
RHETT: Did she say anything else?
SCARLETT: She said....
She asked me to look after Ashley too.
It's convenient to have
the first wife's permission, isn't it?
What do you mean?
What are you doing?
I'm leaving you, my dear.
All you need now is a divorce,
and your dreams of Ashley can come true.
Oh, no!
No, you're wrong. Terribly wrong.
I don't want a divorce.
Oh, Rhett, when I knew tonight,
when I knew I loved you...
...I ran home to tell you.
Oh, darling, darling!
Please don't go on with this.
Leave us some dignity out
of our marriage. Spare us this last.
This last? Do listen to me! I must
have loved you for years, only...
...I was such a fool,
I didn't know it.
Please believe me. You must care.
Melly said you did.
I believe you.
And what about Ashley Wilkes?
I never really loved Ashley.
You certainly gave a good imitation
of it, up to this morning.
No, Scarlett. I've tried everything.
If you'd met me halfway, even
when I came back from London.
I was so glad to see you.
I was, Rhett, but you were so nasty.
Then when you were sick,
and it was all my fault.
I hoped that you'd call for me.
But you didn't.
I wanted you. I wanted you
desperately...
...but I didn't think you wanted me.
It seems we've been
at cross purposes, doesn't it?
But it's no use now.
As long as there was Bonnie,
there was a chance we might be happy.
I liked to think that Bonnie
was you, a little girl again.
Before the war and poverty
had done things to you.
She was so like you.
And I could pet her and spoil her,
as I wanted to spoil you.
But when she went, she took everything.
Rhett, please don't say that.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry for everything.
My darling, you're such a child.
You think that by saying, "I'm sorry,"
all the past can be corrected.
Here, take my handkerchief.
Never, in any crisis of your life, have
I known you to have a handkerchief.
Rhett! Rhett, where are you going?
I'm going to Charleston,
back where I belong.
Please. Please take me with you.
No. I'm through
with everything here.
I want peace.
I want to see if somewhere...
...there isn't something left
in life of charm and grace.
-You know what I'm talking about?
-No!
-I only know that I love you!
-That's your misfortune.
Oh, Rhett!
Rhett!
Rhett! Rhett!
Rhett! If you go, where shall I go?
What shall I do?
Frankly, my dear,
I don't give a damn.
I can't let him go. I can't!
There must be some way
to bring him back.
Oh, I can't think about this now.
I'll go crazy if I do.
I'll think about it tomorrow.
But I must think about it!
I must think about it.
What is there to do?
What is there that matters?
GERALD: You mean to tell me,
Scarlett, Tara doesn't mean anything?
Land's the only thing that matters.
It's the only thing that lasts.
ASHLEY: Something you love more than
me, though you may not know it. Tara.
RHETT: It's this from which you get
your strength, the red earth of Tara.
GERALD: Land's the only thing that matters.
The only thing that lasts.
ASHLEY: Something you love more
than me, though you may not know it.
RHETT: --from which you get
your strength. Tara.
GERALD:
Land's the only thing that matters.
ASHLEY:
Something you love more.
RHETT: --the red earth of Tara.
GERALD: Tara!
ASHLEY: Tara!
RHETT: Tara!
Tara!
Home.
I'll go home.
And I'll think of some way
to get him back.
After all, tomorrow is another day!
