You took the part
that once was my heart
so why not
take all of me?
One, two, three, four.
Take it, Roger.
I'm getting too old for this.
Oh, God.
Happy birthday, my darling.
So, how does it feel
to be thirty-eight?
Oh, great.
Just think, in two years
I'll be forty, in twelve I'll be fifty.
I'm really excited about this.
- It's fun.
- Oh, sweetie.
Hey, what am I doing
with my life?
What am I doing with my career?
- What am I doing with us?
- You're boring us.
Yeah.
Do you love it?
It's an African grave post.
Is that gorgeous?
You bought me a grave post
for my thirty-eighth birthday?
Look, I'm sorry.
I like it, I really do.
It's really nice.
Look, uh, I've been thinkin'.
Remember, remember that thing
you used to wanna talk about,
and I never did?
You know, uh,
the "M" word?
Well, I think maybe it's time
that we did the "M" word.
Roger, I don't think you're
ready to do the "M" word.
Yeah, I am, honest.
Peggy, I want to get...
..."M'd".
Roger, if you can't say
the "M" word,
then you're not ready
to do the "M" word.
I can say the "M" word.
Geez!
Marriage, marriage, of course,
I can say it. What do you think?
I think we shouldn't get into
this right now.
You're going to be late for work,
and you know how daddy hates that.
I just came by to wish you
a happy, happy thirty-eighth.
Mmm.
Happy thirty-eighth.
That's a contradiction in terms.
That was very bodacious.
Hey, Roger Dodger,
what it is?
- Hey, Bix.
-
Makin' any money today?
Almost as much
as I made last night.
- That bad, huh?
- Yeah.
Look, Roger,
I've been thinkin' of joinin'
Jimmy Bowers' big band.
I want you to come and go with me.
I appreciate it, Ty, but--
No, don't give me that but, but jive.
Hey, look at this face.
- I'm quitting the group, Ty.
- You're doin' what?
I gotta give up something.
I figure I still have time to
make something of myself
as a lawyer
and I'm not going any further
as a musician.
Oh, this is an unhappy face.
Not that unhappy.
This is the face of a man who
has given up the wrong thing.
- Don't pick my nose.
-
And if you do not correct
your thinkin' in this matter,
I shall be forced to tell the
world that you are a honky mook!
Tyrone, you really should not
call another person a honky mook.
And why not?
Well, for one reason,
you're white.
- I am?
- Yeah.
Oh, my God, I am.
I'm late, Ty, I gotta go.
I'm doing the right thing, really.
You be cool, fool.
Good jammin' with you, Bix.
Well?
Well, you're dying alright.
Ever since I was a child doctors
have been telling me I'm dying.
Yeah, well, I guess
you've had enough practice
because you're really doing it now.
- How much time?
- A week, a day.
- A month?
- Mm-hm.
Good.
The phone.
- Got a cigarette?
- You don't smoke.
It can't hurt now.
Thank you.
After thirty-two years
of marriage,
you're still a naughty
little devil, aren't you?
Shouldn't you answer that?
Maybe it's your wife.
Ever since she filed for divorce
she hardly ever calls anymore.
I'm sorry, Mr. Schuyler, but,
Edwina Cutwater is on one.
Oh, God.
Alright.
It's okay.
I just wanted to tell you,
your wife subpoenaed me.
Oh, Gretch,
I'm so sorry about that.
I do have to take this call.
- Good morning, Margo.
- Good morning, Roger.
Good morning, Bix.
Any good ones for me today?
Any unfairly evicted tenants?
Uh, farm workers, Indians?
Well, Mr. Van Rensselaer called.
He wants you to fire his chauffeur.
Mr. Spencer Sr. wants you
to draw up a pre-marital agreement
for Mr. Spencer, Jr.
And finally,
Mr. Spencer Jr. called,
he wants you to tell Mr. Spencer Sr.
to mind his own friggin' business.
May justice prevail.
Why do I do it?
I think it's called paying dues.
I've been paying dues for eleven years.
I should own the entire club by now.
- Right on, Roger.
- No more.
I want worthwhile cases.
I want to defend right against wrong.
I want a partnership.
You're telling the wrong people, Roger.
I know. I was practicing.
Pretty good, huh?
I think wadding the message
is very effective.
I'm gonna do this
for Schuyler right now.
Seymour, she was the fourth woman
today to tell she's been subpoenaed.
Mr. Schuyler, I have to talk to you.
I don't want her on the stand!
Listen, if you haven't got the
guff to handle this the right way,
I'm going to find someone who does!
- Mr. Schuyler--
- I was just gonna call you.
Get Miss Cutwater's file.
Go out to the house.
Edwina claims that she's finally dying
and needs to get her affairs in order.
No, uh, I have to discuss
my future here right now.
Well, Roger,
we are discussing your future.
You're going to
Edwina Cutwater's house.
I want a partnership.
Listen, the day you give up bebop
and concentrate on the law, we'll talk.
Start talking.
I quit the band.
As of today I'm dedicating
myself full time to my legal career.
Later today, I'm going to buy a vest.
My God, you're serious.
I am serious.
But I want to start
handling real cases, the big cases.
No more of this trick or treat stuff.
Roger, you don't know how long I have
waited to hear you say those words.
Going out to Edwina Cutwater's
house is not my idea--
No, no. Listen to me.
Long after Edwina
is gone from this earth,
her estate is going to generate
more income for this office
than most small countries see in a year.
And it's going to take
a lot of very sophisticated
legal expertise to structure
and administer those affairs.
Now, you do this for me, today,
go out to her house,
and I'll put you in charge of all that.
Now, if that's not real law,
if that's not big law,
I don't know what the hell is.
Actually the more I think about
this thing, the better it sounds.
Don't look at me
like that, will you?
I'm not going in there
as a messenger boy.
I'm going in as a highly
skilled legal adviser.
This is really good.
No more being looked
down upon by people that think
they're better than I am,
because they're rich.
From now on
I'm gonna be respected...
By people who think they're better
than I am, because they're rich.
Hi. Roger Cobb from Schuyler
and Mifflin to see Miss Cutwater.
- Yes, sir, you are expected.
- I'll show him up.
- Betty Ahrens.
- I'm Roger Cobb.
Try not to excite her, okay?
Edwina:
Grayson? Oh, Grayson.
- Yes, madam?
- Don't forget to pick up
the invitations,
and make sure they're
hand delivered the moment I die.
The moment you die.
Yes, madam.
- Oh, Mr.--
- Cobb.
Cobb. Oh, yes,
you're the tedious one.
Do you mind accompanying me
back to my deathbed?
Now, here's the name of my caterer,
and the evening's menu.
Make sure they have plenty
of goose paté, it's marvelous.
This is for the funeral?
One doesn't have goose
paté at a funeral.
Now, Mr. Fulton Norris is a
wonderful society orchestra.
I should like you to engage him
for the entire weekend.
-
- This is for the wake, ma'am?
Heavens, no. It's for a party,
and I want it to be a corker.
- Guess what I'm going to do?
- What?
I'm going to come back
from the dead.
And, ah, what makes you think
you can do that?
Because I'm rich.
Grayson, come in here, please.
Over.
Miss Cutwater, this is not a parking
ticket we're talking about, here,
this is the, uh, Grim Reaper.
You cannot bribe
the Grim Reaper.
Oh, Mr. Cobb,
I spent a lifetime shackled by...
frailty and poor health...
wheelchairs and sick beds.
It's my heart, you see.
It means well, but it's always
been something of a lemon.
I've had all the money in the world
and not one good chance to enjoy it.
I have never been to Europe.
I've never
been anywhere, really.
Oh, sure I've ordered
from Neiman's and Gucci's,
but I've never
actually been there.
I've never ridden my horses.
I've never been to a ballet.
I've never danced.
But, Cutwater's
aren't quitters.
So, I've decided that if my
wealth cannot help me in this life,
then my God,
it's going to buy me another one.
- Ah, Grayson.
- You, ah, walkie-talkied, madam?
Yes, please send in Mr. Prakha
Lasa and what's her name,
- Fred's daughter.
- Miss Terry, madam.
Gas me.
Excuse me, am I just
getting you goose paté,
or do you have any
legal work for me?
of course I do.
I need you to amend my will...
so that what's her name, um...
Fred's daughter will become
inheritor over my entire
estate.
So we must draw up
a new codicil.
We need it witnessed.
Ah, your grace.
It's alright,
Prakha, come in.
Come in. Come, come.
What's going on here?
- Wait.
- Who's Fred's daughter?
Hello.
- Hello. I'm Terry Hoskins.
- Roger Cobb.
- Uh, so,
you're Fred's daughter?
Mm-hm.
Roger:
Who the heck is Fred?
Terry:
Daddy, come in, please.
I'm against the whole thing, I am.
My father is
Miss Cutwater's stableman.
It's unnatural.
Let me get something
straight here,
you're going to will all of your
money to the stableman's daughter,
and he's against it?
No.
- He just said that--
- You see, I should inherit nothing.
But you just said you wanted to
make her your sole beneficiary.
That is correct.
- So you will inherit the estate?
- No, she won't.
What am I missing here?
You see, thanks to
his highness Prakha Lasa,
I'm going to be transmigrated.
Transmigrated means that my soul
is going to leave my body forever
and become one with the universe.
At which time my soul
will enter her body.
Ah, good plan.
I'm sorry, but I don't think
it's a good plan at all.
My daughter's soul leavin' her body
and going off to who knows where?
Fred, let's not go through
all this again, shall we?
I know I wasn't much of a father
to her when she was growing up,
but I won't lose her again.
No, I won't.
Zip it, Fred.
Miss Cutwater, as your attorney
it is my duty to inform you
that the will could be
contested if you're deemed...
not of perfectly sound mind.
Why you presumptuous
ambulance chaser.
Are you insinuating that I am
not of perfectly sound mind?
No. no, I wouldn't do that,
but I think practically
everybody in
the solar system would.
Mr. Cobb,
that's last thing I need around here
is your ill-informed negativity.
Get out.
- Thanks for not exciting her.
- Prakha:
There, there.
Edwina:
No, Prakha, not yet.
Prakha, not yet.
I'm not ready.
Is everybody here bananas?
Mr. Cobb...
Let me explain something to you.
You see...
closer please.
That's for bananas,
now get out!
What century is this?
I hurt my hand.
I'm going to tell Mr. Schuyler that
you're an insolent little toad.
And demand that he fire you.
Why don't you just enter
his body and do it yourself?
And don't you come back,
you peasant!
Look, lady...
just because my grandfather
didn't rape the environment
and exploit the workers
doesn't make me a peasant!
And it's not that he didn't
want to rape the environment
and exploit the workers,
I'm sure he did.
It's just that as a barber
he didn't have that much opportunity.
Grayson, bring the car
and my hairdresser,
and the golden
diamond jewelry. Over.
I've got to hand it to you,
it's brilliant.
- What is?
- Your scam.
It's legal, it's logical.
I thought the bit with the bowl
was overdoing it a little,
but, it's certainly original.
The bowl, Mr. Cobb,
is attuned to the harmonics
of Miss Cutwater's life force.
When her body dies it becomes
a repository of that life force
so I hold the bowl and it becomes
the conduit from her body to mine.
You really believe that?
Yes.
Of course, uh...
if you're wrong you inherit
twenty million bucks.
I don't want her money.
When I was fifteen
I ran away from home
thinking I could find myself
in the material world.
I found only pain.
His holiness, Prakha Lasa, teaches
that possessions transmit pain.
I want something far more
valuable than money...
far more elusive,
for which I'm willing to give up
my physical being and become one
with the universe.
And ah, don't you think
that's just a little bit...
whacko?
Feel my heart.
You are unhappy.
You are anxious and unfulfilled
because you are not doing
with your life as you wish.
I'm at peace.
Which one of us is crazy?
You are.
Thank you.
Margo.
Oh, Mr. Durand called.
He needs you to set up
a Bermuda corporation,
so he can write off
his honeymoon.
- Also, there was a call--
- Forget it.
I'm telling Schuyler today
he's got to play me or trade me.
He's in the conference room
with Miss Cutwater.
She's here?
Also with her doctor,
with her nurse,
Mr. Mifflin, some english girl
with no bra.
And a Hindu
holding a bedpan on a stick.
I don't think you should
go in there.
Schuyler:
We just had a little
bit more to go over now.
Are you strong enough to continue?
What? Oh, I'm fine. Really.
I'm fine. Tell them.
She could drop dead any minute.
Never mind her.
She's only trying to make me feel good.
I'm very sorry to interrupt.
Madam, I wish to apologize
for upsetting you before.
Mr. Cobb, please don't grovel.
I'm not groveling,
I'm apologizing.
- If I could see you outside.
- If you're trying to save your job,
you're too late.
- What?
- It's quite lost by now.
Let me tell you something.
My father
worked himself into an early grave
defending the rights of needy people
in a rat infested
store front over on ninth street.
When he died my mother took
a job as a plumber's assistant
so I could go to law school
and carry on in his name.
So now the only job I can get
is in some skidrow legal aid office,
I'd just as soon take it
as have to kowtow to people like her
- for the rest of my life!
- Schuyler: That's enough!
You know what you are?
You're an energy vampire.
- That's enough.
- You leap in my neck.
You suck all the fun out of
being a lawyer.
Schuyler:
Shut up! That's enough!
I have never heard such a
moronic load of crap in my life!
Well, I don't have to take that.
No, not you, her.
Did you hear what she wants
to do with her soul?
Yeah.
Jesus Christ,
the woman is looney tunes.
She's nuts!
But you,
Roger, you've got guts.
I never saw you stand up
to anyone like that before.
You have a fire burning
inside you.
To defend people who really need you.
And I never knew that about
your father or your mother.
- Well, I made that up.
- You didn't?
- You son-of-a-gun.
- Pretty good, huh?
I like a man who thinks
on his feet.
Thanks.
Roger, I have a case that needs
a lawyer just like you.
You win it,
and I'll put you up
for a partnership.
This is not for one of these
rich goofballs?
No, no, no.
It's for a very nice man...
who's getting divorced.
I think I'm gonna
be a partner.
Mazel tov!
Oh, Bix, you're going to be
a partner's best friend.
Call the Fulton Morris
Orchestra tell them Miss Cutwater
has requested her favorite saxophone
player Tyrone Wattell for her party.
And she'd like him to receive
a thousand dollars for the night.
We're gonna inform Mr. Wattell.
- Come on, Bix.
-
What a guy.
Now, then...
Mr. Mifflin can witness
the codicil.
I will sign as executor
of the estate
and then we will be all signed,
sealed and---
- Oh, a tunnel...
- Hmm?
- Edwina?
- ...with a very bright light.
I was afraid of this.
What the hell is she
talking about?
Terry...
Prakha...
Schuyler:
What the hell is going on?
Miss Cutwater?
Wait a minute.
Mifflin:
Did she sign everything?
Ahrens:
Jan, S10 I.V. Hurry!
Kim, call the insurance company.
Mifflin:
How is she?
Will she be alright?
Ahrens:
I'm losing her. I'm losing her.
Get out of my way, you fool!
Ahrens:
I lost her.
-
- Roger: Ouch!
Edwina's voice: Where am I?
What?
Edwina:  I'm breathing.
I must be alive.
Who said that?
Edwina:
No, I can't be. I just died.
I'm picking up General Hospital
in my fillings.
Edwina:
Oh, it worked.
Oh, my Lord!
What the hell's happening to me?
I feel like the healthiest
woman alive.
Oooh!
Who said that?
I did.
I'm going crazy.
Edwina voice:
That does not sound like
Fred's daughter.
No, I'm not going crazy.
Something hit me on the head.
Ouch!
I'm just hallucinating.
That's all!
Edwina:
Oh, shit!
What the hell are you doing
in there?
I can't believe this.
I can't even die right.
Why are you doing this to me?
Dear, God, don't you get enough
laughs up there?
What did I ever do to you?
Somebody please tell me
this is not happening.
Edwina:
I'm afraid it is,
so let's just go inside,
and have Prakha Lasa
straighten out this mess.
Oh, geez, I can't move
my right leg.
I'm paralyzed!
Edwina:
Here let me try.
Edwina:
We obviously have mutual
control over our body.
Our body?
It's my body.
I'm not sharing my body
with anyone.
Everybody’s going to be
real disappointed.
Where are we going?
We've got to find Prakha Lasa!
I can't go in there,
Schuyler will think--
Excuse me, this is a private
conversation, do you mind?
Ah, no.
Edwina:
Please, just do as I say!
Nooo!
Edwina:
You seem to have control over
the left side of your body,
while I feel dominant
on the right.
Oh, let go of that.
Oh, you bitch!
How about a little respect
for the deceased?
Let go of my hand you brute!
I will not!
Edwina:
Just stop it!
If you want me out of you,
then you must stop this
ridiculous behavior.
Roger:
Lady, I don't know how
you got in there,
but I'm going to get you
out of me right now!
Let's go!
Edwina:
Just wait, I'll go first.
Calm down and try
to concentrate.
I'm the right side,
Uh, and you're the left.
First me, then you.
Me. You.
See, if we just cooperate.
Now all we have to do
is find Prakha Lasa.
Actually, there's something
we have to do first.
Edwina:
What?
I really have to take a leak.
Bix, go see Margo.
Edwina:
Your foot, my foot,
your foot, my foot, very good.
Your foot, my foot,
your foot, my foot.
You're doing wonderfully well.
Mifflin:
Isn't it awful?
Roger:
You have no idea.
I can't go in there.
That's the men's room.
Just shut up and do as I say!
Don't you ever,
ever yell at me again.
I'm sorry, but this is not
my idea of a good time.
Well, I'm not exactly having
one my best days either.
I died five minutes ago.
Oh, God.
You'll have to do it.
I'll have to do what?
You know, take it out.
Take what out?
The little fireman.
The little fireman?
You know, my penis!
How dare you say penis
to a dead person.
Listen, lady, if you don't
give Big Ed some air,
he's gonna piss all over
your half of my body.
Mr. Cobb, if you're trying
to scare me, it won't work.
Both:
Stop it! Stop it!
Alright...
first, let go of your grip.
Now slowly take your hand...
Now slowly!
Alright,
we're going to try it again.
Carefully. Very carefully.
What the hell are you doing
in there?
I'm trying to release
your Mister Ed.
Stop playing with it already,
and take it out!
You don't have to talk out loud,
I can hear your thoughts.
Oh, great, just what
I always wanted.
Shall I tap?
- Yes.
- Tap, tap.
Thank you.
I meant what I said
about yelling.
I was, ah, just talking
to myself in there...
...it wasn't anything really.
Edwina:
There's Fred's daughter!
Yoohoo, Terry.
Stop it!
From now on, don't use my mouth.
And try to walk more like a man.
Alright.
Mr. Cobb...
- I feel so terrible.
- I know.
It's not your fault
it didn't work.
How do you know it didn't work?
You're not going
to believe this...
Hey, where's the swami?
He left when
all those people came in.
- He's very shy, you know.
- Left? Where did he go?
Oh, stop worrying,
I know where to find him.
You better had!
Mr. Cobb?
You still want to go through
this transmigration thing?
- Well, yes, but she's--
- Fine. Look,
- We'll go get Gunga Den...
- Mr. Cobb?
Excuse me. Mr. Schuyler needs
to see you right away.
Fine, thanks.
Where can we reach you?
I'm staying at Miss Cutwater's.
- Who's we?
- Roger?
He said now!
I'll explain later.
Trust me.
Don't swing your arm so much.
There's something very odd
about Cobb.
The man has been bringing a dog
to a law office for three years
and you just noticed he's odd?
Yes, but he's speaking
with a funny voice.
Have you heard his secretary?
And he's impi--
We'll discuss this later!
Tattle tale.
Are you feeling alright?
Yeah. Just this whole Cutwater
thing really got under my skin.
Look, I need to leave
for just about an hour.
Forget it.
We're going to court tomorrow.
Court tomorrow.
Really, I, I--
Clear the decks.
Sit down.
It's my divorce.
Ah, nobody knew.
Tell you the truth,
it's a little embarrassing.
Seymour was representing me,
but he wasn't doing squat!
He wanted me to settle.
You want a partnership,
you do for me what you did
in the Brenner case.
Oh, God, not now.
Edwina:
Oh, just explain what happened.
Roger: Are you crazy?
I don't even believe it.
If I tell him
he'll have me put away.
Look, before I can
take care of any of this,
there's something very personal,
very private I have to clear up.
Oh, yes, of course.
Alright, sit down.
I'll tell you everything.
- No, no. I meant that--
- That's alright,
don't be embarrassed.
I started cheating on my wife
three years ago.
Edwina:
Oh, goody, man talk.
I never intended to.
Women just started throwing
themselves at me.
Oh, you must be joking.
- What?
-  I must be choking.
Anyway, I know it's not because
I'm Paul Newman or anything.
You can say that again.
- What?
- I said, uh, could you say that again?
I'm not Paul Newman.
Not Paul Newman.
Anyway...
It seems that one of my wife's
best friends suddenly lost her husband.
Well. Women usually do
outlive their men.
So, naturally,
she found herself cut off
from her normal sexual
relations, and, uh...
She turned to you
and you comforted her.
I understand, sir, you really
didn't do anything wrong.
Oh, you better believe it.
I was incredible.
I see, sir. I think I can
figure out the rest.
And then another one was widowed.
Okay, so, two little indiscretions.
That's not such a big deal.
And then, another one.
And, uh, another.
And, uh, pretty soon, just going
to a funeral would give me a hard-on.
Edwina:
Speaking on behalf of the dead,
I find this disgusting.
I think I got the picture now.
I'm not sure you do.
You see, it's not just sex.
Let me tell you.
These sweet darling ladies have
given new purpose to my life.
They given me the opportunity
to give something back to the world
instead of just take, take, take.
- Are you alright?
- Fine. Fine!
Edwina: Ops, sorry.
Anyway, you understand
what I'm saying?
I get to give love
and happiness to people who
really need and appreciate it.
Hell, I'm the west coast
distributor of love and happiness.
And for that,
I have to go to court?
Now I don't deserve that.
I should get a dinner!
Edwina:
He should get a social disease.
- I won't let you down.
- I'm counting on you, son.
Shake hands with him.
Like a man.
Crazy musicians.
You won't regret this.
I know I won't.
If I do,
you'll never practice
in the free world again.
Edwina:
I certainly hope you plan on
losing that case.
How did it go, Roger?
The only thing I plan on losing is you!
Nice talking to you, Rog'.
You know, you have
a great deal to learn
about making
someone feel welcome.
Let's get something straight, here.
I never liked you
when you were in your body,
I certainly don't
like you in mine!
Well, I don't see why you're
getting so upset about all this.
Because I want my body back!
And I want my freedom
and my privacy.
And most of all, I'd like to be able
to take a leak without being fondled!
You may find
this hard to believe,
but fondling you
while you make pee-pee,
is not my idea of a good time.
Fine! Fine!
It's two o'clock.
I have a lot to work to do.
I want you out of me by 3:15.
Now, where's the swami?
Well...
you know he's never
been away from Tibet.
So, I put him up
at the Ambassador.
Let's see.
What is that number?
Hotels, H, H, H,
Let's see.
Let your fingers do--
Here it is,
The Ambassador.
And look over here.
The Arlington.
That's where mommy
in the spring of sixty-two
had her amethyst stolen
from her in the elevator.
It was just so distressing.
Give me that!
No, he hasn't checked out.
Oh, dear.
Yeah, oh, dear.
Don't worry, I know where to find him.
- Good going, Edwina.
- It's Miss Cutwater to you.
- Hello, Margo.
- Oh, hi, Peg.
Roger:
Any woman who fondles me
in a men's room,
I think I can be on
a first name basis with!
That's not fair.
You told me to pull out your penis.
How about a cup of coffee?
Where is she?
Oh, boy.
Where is she!?
- There's nobody here.
- Liar! I heard her!
So you want to get married
and settle down, huh?
Peggy, I swear,
there's nobody else here.
Come out, you little slut.
- Who is she calling a slut?
- Shhh!
I heard that.
Come on, deny it.
Where is she?
It was me.
Bix, stop that.
- What was you?
- The voice you heard.
I was talkin' to myself.
Listen...
your perfume suits you.
It's cheap and common.
Edwina:
At least she slapped your side.
And who did I heard you say
was fondling you in the men's room?
- Me.
- Liar!
Edwina:
How dare she.
- Peggy:
- Edwina!
Edwina?
My name is Peggy, you pig!
No, let me explain.
It's Edwina Cutwater.
She died today.
You did it with a dead woman?
- No!
- Roger, you are sick.
To think I came up here
to even discuss marrying you.
Despite the fact that I heard
what you're doing to my mother.
How did your mother
get into this?
I just found out you're going
to court tomorrow
to represent the other side
against my own mother.
I'm respecting your father.
You're going to try
to beat my mother.
- Oh, God!
- Roger, you go to court
tomorrow, we're through.
If I don't, your father
will have my balls.
Then it's either me
or your balls, Roger.
But you can't have both.
Hmm, very interesting choice.
I'm not certain what purpose
balls actually serve
but they've got to make a
better pair than the two of you.
- Well?
- I'm very attached to them, Peg.
Goodbye, Roger.
By the way...
I never liked your dog
and I think jazz is stupid!
And I faked all those orgasms.
Sound familiar?
Yeah, well, I faked mine, too.
Aw, believe me, we're better off
without her.
She just isn't right for us.
You know, ever since
our little accident,
I have sensed a lot of
hostility coming from you.
Well, excuse me!
But I'm watching my entire
career go down the sewer,
'cause I've got a dead woman
living inside me.
And the only person who can
get you out is some...
cosmic weirdo you can't
even find.
I can so find him.
I think.
Wait, I'm sure I know
where he'll be this evening.
Do you have a car?
Edwina laughing:
Oh, this is fun.
Roger:
Shift, damn it.
- Shifting, whee!
- What are you doing?
I never learned how to drive.
Which is it, one of these
pedal things?
Roger:
The brakes, not the gas!
Edwina:
The brakes, the gas,
I don't know which one it is.
Bix, let go of her.
Edwina:
Stop it.
I'm going to strangle
this mangy mongrel.
Roger:
Alright, that's it.
Edwina:
This isn't the way.
Where are we going?
It's enough that I have
to put up with you,
but I will not subject my dog
to this one minute more.
Tyrone. Oh, great,
I gotta talk to you.
Hey, Roger Dodger.
I got a call from the union
about some gig.
They wouldn't tell me
who recommended me,
but I smelled your
finger prints all over it.
- Thank you, bro.
- It was nothing really.
Can we get on with this,
please?
Who's that?
Someone with you?
Sort of, yeah.
Well, where are
your manners, chump?
Introduce me to the lady.
Edwina Cutwater,
Tyrone Wattell.
- Pleased to meet you.
- Pleased to meet you.
Hairy knuckles for a chick.
Look, I need your help.
Can you take care of Bix
for a couple of days?
Oh, sure, I'd be--
Wait a minute, Roger,
what's wrong?
I really don't think I can
explain it.
What's wrong, Roger.
Well, Edwina died today.
Her soul entered me and took
over the right half of my body.
Why didn't you say so
in the first place?
I knew you'd understand.
Thanks for not having me committed.
Roger. I got a lot of friends
crazier than you,
but I ain't got many better.
Thanks, pal.
Go with him, Bix.
Come on, Bix.
Nice meetin' you, Edwina.
Bye.
Minister:
A woman who would rather
buy a candle,
than curse the darkness.
You pack 'em in, don't you?
Hello. Come in.
- I can start over if you'd like.
- Uh, no, thank you.
And we wonder, 0 Lord,
what it means when a person
passes away
and so few take the time
to pay final respects.
Edwina:
Oh, big deal.
Roger:
He's not here,
let's go find him.
However, we received
a number of mailgrams,
from bereaved loved ones.
Edwina:
Wait! Wait! I must hear this.
Lady, I have to prepare for the
most important case of my life,
let's get out of here, okay?
Edwina:
No. I want to hear these mailgrams.
- Oh, I really got to--
- I mean it, sit!
Very touching.
We will miss her.
The Bel Air
Oxygen Supply Company.
She was truly
a great customer,
J.J. Wheelchairs.
Edwina:
Oh, they remembered.
From Browing Orthopedic Mattresses...
May she continue
to rest in peace.
Edwina:
Oh, how deeply touching.
- Mr. Cobb.
- Huh?
Mr. Cobb?
Oh, hi.
- What time is it?
- Almost midnight.
Mr. Cobb, this morning
you were going to tell me
how you knew it didn't work.
Edwina?
- She's asleep.
- Who's asleep?
Edwina.
Don't wake her.
Wow.
This is great.
When she's asleep.
Mr. Cobb, Miss Cutwater is dead.
No. She's not.
She entered me instead of you.
What?
- Where's the swami?
- I haven't seen him.
Maybe he's back at the hotel.
I just called,
there's no answer.
Well, we should go there
and wait for him.
I've got to find that guy.
I can't take more...
- Oh, God!
- You poor dear.
You must relax.
Stop worrying.
Oh, no. I really think
we oughta go find him.
I'm sure he'll be at
the funeral tomorrow morning.
And if Miss Cutwater
really is inside you,
he will help her leave
your body, and enter mine.
I think I envy her.
Mr. Cobb,
this morning when I placed
your hand on my heart,
did you feel anything special?
Yes,
I felt your left--
Yes, I felt something
very special pass between us.
Oh, Mr. Cobb, by this time
tomorrow my soul will be gone.
I want to know love
one last time.
Don't you think
we really oughta go--
Please, Mr. Cobb.
Let me take the memory of passion
to sustain me in the next world.
So this would be like...
...for a good cause?
Oh, yes.
We have to be very quiet.
I'm not sure
that will be possible.
It's a good cause.
It's a good cause.
I'm ready, Mr. Cobb.
Take me.
Shhh! Keep sleeping, Edwina.
Now.
Edwina:
What-- what is all this?
What's going on here?
- No.
- Oh, yes.
Edwina:
What are you doing to her?
Roger:
Nothing. I'm not doing anything.
Go back to sleep, you're dreaming.
Why, Miss Hoskins!
You whore!
You lascivious whore.
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.
You're a shameless little slut.
- Yes.
- Shut up!
Talk dirty.
You're nohing
but a cheap sex tramp.
Good!
Now call me a poodle, Mr. Cobb.
Call me a cheap slut,
sex poodle.
Why you deserve a good
spanking!
Oooh! Mr. Cobb!
Oh you, you little bad bunny.
- Edwina, no!
- Mr. Cobb, yes.
You love rocket.
Stop talking like that.
Oh, spank me again, you bad boy.
Edwina, stop it!
I will not!
She should be ashamed of herself.
And you should, too!
Hey, hey, hey stop!
Mr. Cobb?
For God's sake, Edwina,
go away, will you?
I own that body!
What if you got her pregnant?
You have no right.
No, you have no right.
And you have no class.
You're rude, crude
and thoroughly unattractive.
God, it is Miss Cutwater.
I'm sorry you had
such a lousy life.
I really am. But just because
nobody ever did this with you
doesn't mean the rest of us
have to go without.
As a matter of fact,
I am quite proud of my virginity!
It's something
I have always treasured.
Of course you did!
Nobody else ever wanted it!
Terry, wait!
Lady...
if Prakha caca doesn't
show up by tomorrow
I'm going to get a lobotomy...
or a high colonic or something.
But you're getting
the keys to the street.
Oh, stop being such a martyr.
As soon as I'm not dead anymore,
I'll pay you for your trouble.
Pay me? Oh, Jesus,
I just realized why no one
showed up at your memorial services.
You forgot to hire mourners.
Edwina:
You are an insensitive horse's ass,
do you know that?
Oh, drop dead.
Look, Cobb, I am talking to you.
For your information,
there's a perfectly good reason
nobody showed up
at my memorial service.
Yeah, what?
I don't have any friends.
I'm looking back
at an entire lifetime
and I don't have one friend.
I never had any friends.
I've had only nannies
and tutors
and servants and nurses.
Once my parents hired a clown
to entertain me,
but he didn't like me.
And when my parents weren't
in the room,
he'd just sit there.
He didn't lift a finger
to amuse me.
That's a terrible clown.
Yes.
Well, that's not all.
When Fred's daughter
was a little girl,
she'd come to my house
to visit her father
and the nurses would push
my oxygen tent
over to the bedroom window
so I could watch her
and all of her little friends
ride my horses
and swim in my pool
and run and play and laugh
and dance.
Then I swore,
I'd give every cent I ever had
to be able to do all that.
To be free.
To be like her.
Well, I've humiliated myself.
Anyway, what I really
wanted to say was
I'm sorry if I spoiled
your birthday.
And I'm sorry if I made you
being dead an unpleasant experience.
I am dead, aren't I?
Oh, please, make me not dead.
I can't, Edwina.
No sense wishing.
Oh, I feel much better.
It's really late.
Why don't you go back to sleep.
Well, aren't you coming to bed?
I can't.
I've got to prepare
for this case tomorrow.
You go to sleep.
Edwina:
Okay.
Good night, Roger.
Good night, Edwina.
Edwina:
Roger? Roger?
Roger, wake up.
Wake up, Roger.
Funeral time.
Let's go.
We've got to get up, Roger.
Come on!
Up, up, up, up.
Let's go!
Did you have a good night's
sleep last night?
Oh, yeah.
Got the full seven--
seven and a half minutes.
Oh, God.
Edwina:
Roger!
Alright! Alright!
I'm awake. I'm awake.
Edwina:
Well you have no idea
what it's like
to be inside a healthier body
than you've ever been in before.
I know. That's what
I was trying to find out last night.
I can not believe you're
still upset about that.
Careful, careful.
Of course you can't.
Can we hurry this up, please?
See, your problem is,
you don't understand how
life is to be lived.
It's to be experienced
and savored.
Edwina:
Oh, I know that you big dope.
Why do you think I've gone
to so much trouble and expense
to buy myself another chance?
'Cause you're operating under
the mistaken assumption
that it's going to make
a difference.
Oh, come on.
It will, too, make a difference.
Inside your new body
you'll still be the same 'ol sour puss.
You'll wind up as bitter and
alone as you always have been.
Edwina:
Oh, I think not.
I'm gonna dance, Roger.
I'm gonna twirl and whirl and spin.
I'm gonna cha-cha-cha.
I'm gonna dip deeply.
- Go like this.
- It's too unattractive.
So is a deep scar.
Just do as I say,
we don't have time to argue.
What's the big hurry anyway?
My funeral's not until 10:30.
I have to be in court at 8:30.
How are you gonna make
the 10:30 funeral
if you have to be in court?
I'll figure it out
at 10:29, okay?
You are so cranky when you
haven't had enough sleep.
And you recognize your
signature on this check?
Yes.
And on this?
Yes.
And this?
Yes.
No further questions.
Counselor?
Edwina:
Roger?
Roger?
Roger? Oh, my God.
You can't fall asleep on me now.
Judge:
Counselor?
Just a second.
Edwina:
Roger, please, wake up.
Counselor, the court is waiting.
Well...
Your honor--
Edwina:
Edwina, a man, act like a man.
Your honor, ah...
your honor...
Proceed with the witness.
What the hell's the matter
with you?
I'm just a little nervous,
that's all.
Don't be nervous.
It's just your career
that's at stake, that's all.
Mr. Schuyler...
you didn't really
give those women
a half million dollars in gifts now,
did you?
Yes, I did.
Well, I'll bet you had
a darn good reason to,
now didn't you, sport?
Why are you acting like this?
Say yes.
Yes.
He had a darn good reason.
- Proceed.
- Proceed?
Edwina:
Proceed, Edwina, like a man.
Like a man.
Wait a second, every Christmas
you gave me--
You gave Miss Cutwater
darling little gifts, now didn't you?
- Yeah.
- So, it's your practice.
Indeed, ladies and gentlemen
of the...
...world.
It's standard practice among
many business professionals
to reward valued clients
with gifts, is it not?
Yeah.
Yes, it is!
Objection!
The money in question came
from the Schuyler's personal account
and not from the law firm.
And therefore cannot
be construed as business gifts.
Good point, toots.
Women, huh?
Can't live with 'em,
Can't live without 'em.
Edwina:
Oh, Roger, please wake up.
Judge:
Mr. Cobb?
Edwina:
I'm sorry, Roger.
Roger! Wake up!
Mr. Cobb, are you alright?
Yeah.
No problem.
How do you respond
to the objection?
Objection?
Ah, could you read that back?
The money in question came from
the Schuyler's personal account,
not from the law firm
and therefore
cannot be construed
as business gifts.
Business gifts?
Edwina:
I'm sorry, I couldn't
think of anything else.
Roger:
Edwina, you're brilliant.
Your honor,
Mrs. Schuyler's sole source
of support was Mr. Schuyler,
whose sole source of income
was the law firm.
So the better the law firm's
business was
the more money Mr. Schuyler
could take home to Mrs. Schuyler.
Therefore, since business gifts
are intended to increase
business,
the more generous Mr. Schuyler
was with his gift giving,
the better able he was
to support Mrs. Schuyler
in the manner to which
she's become accustomed.
Give me a minute.
Edwina, I could kiss you.
We're gonna win it.
I'm gonna get my partnership
and we're gonna make that funeral.
Of course, none of those
women were clients,
but I won't tell anyone
if you won't.
Edwina:
What?
I'm going to overrule
the objection.
- Thank you, your honor.
- Edwina: Just a second,
if they're not his clients,
then this isn't fair.
Your honor, I move we dismiss
claims for damages
on the grounds that
those women were not his--
Shut up!
- What did you just say?
- Nothing.
Judge:
Just tell me what you said.
I didn't say anything.
- Were not his what?
- Nothing, your honor.
Those women were not his client---
Mr. Cobb, are you alright?
Just bit my tongue, that's all.
Mr. Schuyler, were any of those
women clients of yours?
Ah, here we go.
No!
You're dead meat, buddy.
It's not me,
it's Edwina Cutwater,
her soul's inside me.
Oh, that's right,
blame it all on me.
Well, it is your fault,
I had this case won.
No, I had it won!
But it would have been wrong!
What the hell is going on here?
It's not fair and I will not be
a party to unfairness.
Edwina, we're in a court of law.
Fairness has nothing to do with it.
That will cost you
five hundred dollars.
Contempt of court!
- Good for you, judge.
- A thousand dollars!
- Will you shut up?
- No, you shut up! Fifteen hundred!
Not you, her.
I got someone inside me!
Well then both of you shut up!
Don't you tell me
to shut up, Charles.
I contributed to your campaign.
Two thousand dollars and bailiff
throw this jackass out of my court!
I'm going to the state bar.
You're a lunatic.
You can't do this to me.
Mifflin:
He's not just a lunatic,
he's a pervert, too.
He plays with himself
in the men's room.
And he cheated on me, daddy.
He had sex with a dead body
in your office.
You're fired, Cobb!
Edwina:
Oh, Roger, I see what you mean
about life is to be savored.
It's so, it's so dramatic.
I am going to kill you.
Edwina:
I was just trying to help.
You failed!
You know what's happened to me
since you've been helping me?
I've lost me girl!
I've lost my job!
I've alienated my dog!
I broke my sunglasses!
You can't even get
that kind anymore.
- Stop helping me!
- You know, you are so ungrateful.
If it weren't for me
you would get that partnership
and then you'd have to take
cases like that.
And kiss your father's
high ideals goodbye.
You'd also be married to Peggy.
You call that savoring life?
Look who's talking about
savoring life.
I spent my life in a sick bed.
What's your excuse?
You know, it's just like a dead person
to say something like that.
- How much to the airport?
- Uh, thirty bucks.
Make it a hundred.
Pan Am Airlines.
See that he gets on the plane.
Geez, lady, this plane
don't leave till midnight.
- Make it two hundred.
- No problem.
No problem.
- Bon voyage.
- Voyage?
We're wasting our time here.
Let's get to the cemetery.
He better be there, lady.
- Maybe Terry picked him up.
- He just better be there!
Edwina:
Oh, there's the elevator.
Hurry!
Oh, I love running.
- Have you seen Prakha?
- I was hoping you had.
I stopped by the hotel
this morning, but he wasn't there.
Oh, I'm ruined. God.
Edwina:
What is that?
And who are all those people
behind my hearse?
Roger:
Oh, I invited them.
Edwina:
What do you mean?
Last night while
you were asleep,
I wanted to surprise you.
I thought it might make your
funeral a little more fun.
I don't know.
Edwina?
Edwina?
You got a little mirror?
Uh, compact or something.
Thank you.
Oh, Roger, thank you.
Okay, okay.
Don't make a big deal out of it.
I just-- I just did it
'cause I thought I liked you.
I've gotten over that since then.
Now, come on.
Edwina:
It's alright. I'm okay now.
Really, I'm fine.
- You're okay?
- Yes.
It's the nicest thing anybody's
ever done for me.
Don't say that.
Well, it is.
You're the best friend
I've ever had.
- Thanks.
- Are you alright?
Oh, yeah.
The music got to me.
Minister:
...and I will dwell in the house
of the Lord forever.
Amen.
crowd: Amen.
Terry?
I have this
terrible feeling we're never
going to see Prakha Lasa again.
Oh, I gotta find that guy.
- Maybe he's back at the hotel.
- I told you, he's not there.
Let's call the police,
file a missing persons report.
Hey, maybe he's trying
to get home.
- Let's check the airport.
- Actually, you may be right
about the hotel.
He's bound to turn up
there eventually.
- We should try there first.
- Okay.
- What are you doing?
- We may not have another chance.
Oh, but I really don't think
I can--
Please, Roger,
I want to feel your naked skin
next to mine.
I want to feel our bodies merge.
Well, I guess there's nothing
wrong with a quick, little merge.
Edwina:
Oh, no you don't.
Do we have to go through
this again?
Roger: Why don't you just relax,
maybe you'll learn something.
Edwina:
I thought we were going
to find Prakha Lasa?
Roger:
I'm just taking a little breather,
that's all.
Edwina:
Yes, well, put your little breather
back inside your trousers
and let's go find him.
- Roger, what's wrong?
- What?
Don't I excite you?
Edwina, what are you doing?
Edwina:
I am think of very old nuns.
Oh, please don't do this to me.
Roger, don't you want me?
Oh, God.
Now she's thinking of dead kittens.
Would you excuse us?
Alright.
What happened to
"Oh, Roger, you're my best friend"?
I just don't feel like performing
a sexual act on Fred's daughter.
Okay, okay. How about if she
preforms one on us?
- No!
- Please?
No! No! What is so important
about sex?
What's so important about--
That's like saying,
"What's so important about laughing?"
or, Duke Ellington,
or the World Series?
It's one of those things
that makes you feel like
you're really living,
like you're glad to be alive.
I am already glad to be alive.
I don't need to play tonsil
hockey with some english tart,
to feel good.
I already feel good.
I feel wonderful.
In fact, I feel...
quite tingly.
That's right.
Those are my tingles you're feeling.
What do you mean?
It's called sexual...
- ...excitement.
- It is?
Yes.
And if you think this feels good,
wait'll you feel hot...
passionate...
boffing feels like.
And what happens?
Bigger tingles?
Oh, major tingles.
But will she still respect us
in the morning?
She doesn't respect us now.
Let's boff.
Edwina:
Oh, dear, this could
be sort of embarrassing.
Roger:
For who?
Edwina:
For me. As soon as I get
Terry's body,
you'll know what
I look like naked.
Roger:
I swear to God
I'll never tell anyone.
Edwina:
Okay, thank you.
Roger:
You're welcome.
Now, shut up!
Edwina:
Well, what should I do?
How can I help?
Roger:
Fantasize.
Edwina:
Okay, I'm good at that.
- Oh, Terry.
- Oh, Roger.
Oh, Clark.
Wait a second.
Wait!
- What are you doing?
- I'm fantasizing.
I know, my head is filled with pictures
of Clark Gable taking his shirt off.
I know.
Isn't that hot?
No! It's sort of cooling me off,
if you know what I mean?
It's making me tingle
like crazy, Roger.
Great, great. Now, just throw
in a couple of women on top of him
and we're in business, okay?
Okay.
- Is it alright now?
- Sort of.
She's got the whole cast of
Gone With The Wind humping in my head.
- Oh, Roger.
- Oh, Terry.
Edwina:
Oh, Clark. Vivian and Olivia.
Oh, Ashley and Butterfly.
Terry:
Oh, no. Son-of-a-bitch.
Son-of-a-bitch?
I don't believe it.
Prakha, where the hell
have you been?
Been?
The airport?
What the hell were you doing
at the airport?
Prakha:
Airport?
Prakha, Prakha, it's now time
for Miss Cutwater's soul
to enter miss Hoskins.
Enter miss Hoskins?
It's me, Prakha,
I'm inside Roger.
-
- Go warm up the bowl.
Yeah!
Terry?
I guess it wasn't meant
to be between us.
I'll always regret that.
But I want you to know that,
wherever it is you're going,
I hope you'll be very happy.
Oh, I will. I've got a wonderful house
and beautiful horses
and all the money in the world
why shouldn't I be happy?
What?
Well...
if you think I'm really going
to go through with this,
you're not just stupid,
you're crazy.
What do you mean?
I'll handle this.
What do you mean?
When I first heard about this
I thought,
if the mad woman wants
to give her money away,
she may as well give it to me,
but I never really thought
that the flying nun here
would pull it off.
Wait a second.
you just can't leave her in me!
I'd really love to stay and chat,
darling,
but you served your purpose.
And I've got to get back
to my mansion,
and get ready for my party.
Ciao.
Oh, by the way,
don't bother coming.
The guards will have orders
to keep you out.
Bye, Roger.
Goodbye, Miss Cutwater.
So long, Prakha.
Please, don't say it.
Oh, dear God.
All I wanted was a second chance.
A fair shake.
Instead I've made
a complete mess of your life.
And I've...
I've left all my money
to a lying, cheap slut,
sex poodle.
Oooh!
Prakha, I want you
to release my soul.
Give Roger his freedom.
No! She double crossed us,
we can fight this.
No. Perhaps Prakha can
put my soul into an eagle.
Or some wonderful bird, Roger.
So that I can fly free
with the wind.
Hover over my house...
and shit on her head.
Stop talking like that.
I can't help it.
I'm pissed.
I became a lawyer because
I wanted to fight injustice.
I wanted to help the little guy
against the big guy.
Big guy!
Instead, I wound up representing
powerful rich people like you.
But now, don't you see,
you're pauper.
You're bilked out of
what is rightfully yours
by Miss Terry Hoskins,
who is today one of the wealthiest
women in the state of California.
And you wanna be a bird?
Forget it!
Oooh!
Don't go soft on me now.
Oh, it's not that.
It's just that offering you your freedom
is the first unselfish thing
I've ever done.
How's it feel?
Oh, wonderful.
You're okay, Edwina.
Give me the number of the
Fulton Norris Orchestra, please.
Dad, you don't have to do that.
You're not an employee anymore.
- Someone's got to do it.
- I shall hire someone.
Pack your things.
You're moving up to the house.
I won't move in there.
It's not right.
Yes, you will.
I won't have people saying
my father lives in a stable.
I bought you a tuxedo.
You're coming to the party tonight.
For God's sake take a bath!
You know, you're nicer to that
horse than you are to people.
Why don't you take him
to your party?
If I thought it were appropriate,
I would.
Oh, you're lucky
you're a gelding.
Norris: Snap it up, guys.
Thank you.
Smile please. And if you have
to winkie let's do it now.
We'll have a full rehearsal
in five minutes.
Come on, come on.
Come on.
Roger, exactly how you plan
on pullin' this off?
Beats the heck outta me.
Well, if I can be of
any help at all,
you in worse trouble
than I thought.
That's right.
Roger:
Strum, strum, strum.
Edwina:
Oh, this is so much
more fun than being a lawyer.
Roger:
I know.
Edwina:
I think you should forget the
law and become a musician full time.
Roger:
Oh, it's a nice dream,
but I can't.
Edwina: Roger, there's
nothing sadder then looking back
at the end of your life and saying,
"I didn't do it right."
And believe me, I know.
Roger:
Yeah, my solo's comin' up.
I need control of my hand.
- Can you give it to me?
- Sure.
Edwina:
Oops, sorry again.
Is this some sort of a joke?
You didn't like that?
Listen, I'll be okay.
I just need a minute.
Alright, gentlemen.
Let's take a break.
Who are those guys?
- Bring the bowl.
- The bowl.
Come on.
You know, your friend's
a real freak.
Thank you.
Fred:
See you in the mornin'.
I'm gonna put on
a bloody tuxedo.
Oh, Edwina?
Okay, Miss Hoskins.
Hoskins.
- Grab the bowl!
- Stop it!
Edwina in bowl?
- Where's Edwina?
- Edwina.
- Edwina in water?
-  Edwina.
You just made
a big mistake, buster.
Guards!
Can you put Edwina
back in the bowl?
Back in bowl.
Yes, back in bowl.
- Yes, back in bowl.
- Back in bowl. Nyhm.
Nyhm? Whatta you mean?
Oh, you have to fix the bowl?
- Fix bowl.
-  Fix bowl.
-  Fix bowl.
- Fix bowl.
- You put Edwina back in bowl.
- Back in bowl.
Edwina, back in bowl.
- Go fix bowl.
- Go fix bowl.
Go, go, go!
Edwina, if you can hear me,
blow some bubbles or something.
I'm talking to a bucket.
Get the bucket.
Get the bucket.
Don't let him get away. Hurry!
Ty, feel this.
Take good care of it.
What is it?
It's very, very special.
No problem.
Hey, where are you going
with that green bucket?
Get out of my way!
Oooh, damn!
It's alright.
Terry, No!
Want us to throw
him out, ma'am?
No, he's harmless, now.
Goodbye, Edwina.
Good evening.
Ah, Mr. Mifflin.
Good evening, Mr. Schuyler.
We have rather
a pleasant orchestra.
Why don't you come and dance?
Good evening, senator.
Daddy, how debonair.
Oh, good evening.
I'm Terry Hoskins.
Welcome to Hoskins Manner.
All of me...
why not take all of me...
can't you see...
I'm no good without...
God rest her wonderful soul.
I'll never forget her.
Just remember how
comforting it will be
to look around
this magnificent home
and always see a little bit
of Edwina in everything.
Yes, especially the flower bed.
Yes.
Ty, I thought I had
everything under control.
I'm sorry mah man.
I did not see her grab the pitcher.
You know what I'm sayin'?
It's not your fault, Ty.
Oh, man, I feel empty.
You know,
I know this sounds crazy...
but I actually miss
the old girl.
Who are you calling
an old girl?
It's not funny, Ty.
I'm not trying to be funny,
you-- you peasant.
Edwina?
No, it's Pearl Bailey.
Who the hell do you think it is?
Oh, Edwina.
Hey, hey,
that's my side, stupid.
- I'm over here.
- What are you doing in Ty?
How should I know,
I can't see a thing in here.
Oh, man, when you set
that pitcher down here
and said take care of it,
I thought it was gin and I drank some.
You mean you've been
inside all the time?
Why didn't you say something?
I wanted to see
if you missed me.
Cute, cute, cute, oh God!
Come on, Ty. Come on.
- Come on.
- Hey, Bix.
Prakha?
Fix bowl.
- Ah, fix bowl. Great.
- Edwina in water?
No, no! Edwina not in water.
You're not gonna believe this.
Say something.
Your holiness, it is I,
Edwina Cutwater.
I fail to see humor
in the situation.
He drank her.
Drink her.
He drink her.
He drink her?
If it had not been
for Mr. Wattell...
I'd be Edwina the flower bed
right now, you big dope.
Big dope!
Look, look. Take Edwina out,
put back in me.
- In me.
- Okay?
Okay.
Really?
It's the only safe place.
Edwina:
Oh, you really
are my friend.
Tyrone:
I sure hope nobody
else can see this.
Good night.
We're in the Roosevelt, you know.
Yes. If you need anything
you call Grace.
Good night.
Ty, don't be crazy.
You gotta get back on the bus.
No way, Jose. I gotta find out
how this megillah ends.
- Ty!
- Besides...
I can be of help. Walking around
in the dark is my territory.
- Okay, you're hired.
- Thank you.
Oh, God! This way.
What kind of seein' eye dog
is this anyway?
You hang back here.
Hang back here.
Edwina:
Hi, sailor.
Are you having a good time?
I am.
I hope I have as much fun in my
new body as I've had in yours.
Thanks.
There she is.
Roger, now that you know what
a horrible person she is...
aren't you glad you
weren't intimate with her?
I thank my lucky stars.
I'm glad you said that.
I've been thinking...
if things work out, you just
might get another chance.
Oh, Edwina Cutwater.
That's our cue.
- Let's go.
- Let's go.
Ty, watch your head.
Shhh! Come on Prakha, come on.
Bix, go outside, go on.
- Prakha, take care of Ty.
- Ty.
- Take care of Ty.
-  Ty.
Good. Shhh!
Oooh!
Hello, darling.
Watta you waitin' for, Roger?
Grab her!
Watch out man,
I think she's got a gun.
Let's all take a
little walk now, shall we?
Where we goin'?
Shhh, you don't want to
wake up the other guests.
What are you going to do?
I shall say you sneaked back
into the house to rob me.
Oh, we in trouble, Roger.
That you took this gun
from my night table.
Big trouble.
You led me at gunpoint
to a quiet room.
This is it.
Get in there!
How do you expect
to get away with this?
I'll just tell the truth.
You brought me to this room...
we struggled, I grabbed the gun.
What the hell is going on?
Watch out!
Sounds like a gunshot!
Somebody's fighting now, Roger.
Somebody just knocked over
some furniture.
Sounds like an end table with
tchothkes keys on it, Roger.
It's okay, now.
It's all over.
Who won?
- We did, Ty.
- I'm calling the police.
Good idea.
Who's that?
No, don't!
I won't go back to jail.
Back to jail?
Who's going back to jail?
Terry?
Where did all these
people come from?
Get me the police.
- Police?
- That's right.
This is attempted homicide.
Two counts, maybe.
Oh, no. That'll be
her third conviction.
Third conviction?
You're a three time loser.
You're going into the slammer
and they're going to throw away the key.
I won't go back.
I promise I'll kill myself first.
She would, you know.
Hello, police?
Yes, this is Burton Schuyler.
I want to report
an attempted homicide.
- Yes, I'm over here--
- Stop!
Miss Cutwater...
Yes?
If I go to jail,
I take my body with me.
Hang up, Schuyler.
I'll make a deal with you.
Terry.
Oh, my lord,
that was powerful.
Edwina.
Roger.
It worked. It really worked.
Is Terry in there, too?
She's gone.
Terry?
Are you sure this is what
you want, honey bun?
Thank you, ma'am.
I don't know how I'm
going to explain this
to her parole officer.
Thank you.
That's quite alright, Fred.
Come on, baby.
I'm gonna fix you up
a nice private stable
and never leave daddy again.
No more thieving,
no more swindling...
just runnin' and prancin'
and jumpin' for the rest
of your life.
So, how do you feel?
Alive and healthy and...
and scared.
Why?
Because I finally got
what I always wanted...
and I've no excuses anymore.
Yeah, welcome to the real world.
- What?
- Tingles.
It's supposed to.
You oughta try it more often.
Is that advice
from my lawyer?
Lawyer, hell. I'm no lawyer.
I'm a musician.
- You are?
- Yeah.
You know, I've had more real
feeling in the last two days
than I've had in the last
ten years in that damn office.
Those papers stacked
up to here and
that florescent lighting
burning off all my vitamins.
Unlike you, most of us only get
to go around once in life and
I'm not going to spend the rest
of mine sitting behind a desk.
Oh, I love it when you talk
like a beer commercial.
Hey, let's dance.
I don't know how.
Oh, it's easy.
Now, put your feet
on top of mine.
Come on. This is how kids
learn how to dance. See?
Try it with your own feet.
All of me
Why not take all of me
Can't you see
I'm no good without you
Take my lips
I want to loose them
Take my arms
I'll never use them
Your goodbye
Left me with eyes that cry
How can I go on without you
You took the part
That once was my heart
So why not take all of me
Why not take all...
Of me
Take all of me
Can't you see
I'm no good without you
Take my lips
I want to loose them
And take my arms
I'll never use them
Your goodbye
Left me with eyes that cry
How can I go on without you
You took the part
That once was my heart
So why not, why not,
why not, why not, why not
Why not, why not, why not,
why not, why not
Why not take all of me
Why not take all of me, baby
Why not take all of me
Why not take all of me.
