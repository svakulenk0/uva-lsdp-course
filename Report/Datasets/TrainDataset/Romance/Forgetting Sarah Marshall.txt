Good for you, Pete.
Good for you.
BILLY: Access Hollywood
spotlight on sexy
crime fighter Sarah Marshall:
Hi, everybody, welcome
to Access Hollywood.
I'm Billy Bush:
Each week, millions of
viewers love to watch
Ms: Marshall's
brainy sexpot character,
Maddy Stark,
alongside Billy Baldwin's
dark and brooding,
hard-to-love
lead detective, Hunter Rush:
And this isn't
your jurisdiction:
I just made it
my jurisdiction:
Can you say "cat fight"?
BILLY: Off-screen,
Sarah cozies up
to her successful
composer boyfriend,
Peter Bretter:
He's no household name,
yet Bretter's
dark and ominous score
has set the tone
for this gruesome juggernaut:
Take a look:
What do you think?
I think it's gonna be hard
for her
to re-enter the pageant
without a face:
BILLY: Looks like
the sky's the limit
for this adorable couple:
Anything could happen:
We got to do something
We got to do something
Before Mother Earth
gets any more hurt
We got to do something
BILLY: We leave you tonight
with the newest smash single
from Infant Sorrow:
Lead singer and notorious
lothario, Aldous Snow,
begs us to change
in his environmental anthem,
We've Got to Do Something.
I hope, for once,
we all hear the message:
Good night:
Mr: Prime Minister
and Mr: President
You better see
that it's not only me
No, a mob is rising in size
And they've
been dying to scream
Hey, baby.
Just working.
Salad.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Totally.
I didn't realize that
you were gonna
be back so early.
Great. I'll see you
in a bit.
Okay, bye.
ALDOUS:
It's time to do something
Someone should do something
We got to do something
And that someone
is you and you
And you and you
I pray
it ain't all lost and gone
I pray we might learn
right from wrong
And I pray this broken day
will not last too long
Hey, you got here fast.
I got a surprise for you.
Peter, as you know,
I love you very much.
Are you breaking up with me?
Pete, are you...
I just need a minute.
Okay.
Please don't go.
Why don't you just
put on some clothes,
and we can sit down
and discuss this.
No. I can't
do anything
right now.
I'm so sorry, Pete.
I'm in love
with you.
Why don't you just
put some clothes on,
okay?
I'm not going to
go put clothes on.
I know what that means,
if I put clothes on,
it's over. Okay?
Excuse me.
Let's talk.
Let's talk about him.
I feel...
I've been feeling
for a long time
that we've been
growing apart.
We're leading
different lives.
Who's the dude?
Who's the dude? What?
No, that's not
what this is about.
There's no one else.
I know what's happening
here. I really do.
You've been
working so much lately,
that we haven't
got to spend
much time together,
and you're forgetting
what it's like
to be with me.
But maybe, if we just held
each other or something,
you would remember
what it's like
to be with me.
Just hold me. No.
Please. Here we go.
There's someone else.
I'm sorry.
We don't hang out
in places like this,
Liz and I.
Why did you take me here?
This place smells
like stripper's perfume.
I'm gonna get herpes
just from sitting
on this couch.
Sure you okay,
bro? Yeah?
Yeah.
Yeah. You don't
have to keep asking me.
I'm good.
You're out!
Thank you so much
for this opportunity:
Auf Wiedersehen!
Auf Wiedersehen!
Thank you:
Thank you all:
Auf Wiedersehen!
I feel really good.
I feel happy.
Maybe you should work
on the Dracula musical.
Look, you've been
working on it
for a while.
It'll help your mind.
Be creative.
Think about you.
I think I need to
fuck somebody.
You're not
my stepbrother anymore.
You're
a step-stranger.
Why you talking like that?
Brian!
You don't need to put
your P in a V
right now.
No, I don't.
I need to B my L
on somebody's T's.
That's disgusting.
You don't need
to be doing that.
And if anything,
you should
leave your P in the V
and blow it inside the V,
so you can have a B-A-B-Y
and be a normal person.
I'm leaving, man.
I'm out of here.
She's fucking somebody.
Okay, Bri?
It's all I can think about,
is that she's out there,
and until I do
the same thing, I'm gonna
feel like I wanna die.
So just talk to girls
with me tonight,
all right?
All right. All right,
I'll help you out.
I'll talk to girls with you.
So, Peter, what do you do?
Musician.
He's being modest.
He works on a show
called Crime Scene:
Oh, my God!
It is what it is,
you know?
No, I love that show.
Wait, Crime Scene:
Scene of the Crime or
Crime Scene: Phoenix?
Scene of the Crime:
Oh, my God!
I love that show.
I find you both
very sexually
attractive.
Let's pump
the brakes. Okay?
I think that
having sex
with either of you
would be
a great treat
for me.
You are so funny.
PETER: I just got out
of a five-and-a-half-year
relationship,
so I'm not looking
for anything serious.
Just sexual activity.
Let's wrap it up, buddy.
You wanna come home?
I'm sorry,
you're cracking me up.
Yeah. Oh, yeah?
Do you wanna
come home?
Stop it, seriously.
That was fun.
Yeah, yeah.
Overall, I think
that went
really well. Yeah.
I want to have sex with you!
Are you crying?
What? No.
I'm sorry
that I'm
being so weird now.
No, that's okay.
You've been weird
pretty much
the whole time, so
it's not unusual. Okay.
Last night, like
some sort of idiot,
I had sex with this woman
who I barely even know.
I used a condom, but
I'm really scared
that I have an STD, Doc.
Peter, I'm a pediatrician.
Have you noticed
you're sitting
on a fire truck?
Right. Little kids running?
Yeah, this is new.
I like it.
I'm kind of
backed up...
Could you take a look
at my penis?
Go ahead.
Let me see it.
Sorry.
That's all right.
Take it out.
Good.
You barely
looked at it.
It's a good-looking
dick, Peter.
Do you think Beautiful dick.
maybe while I'm here,
I could get some blood work?
Peter!
Your girlfriend
dumped you, right?
Are you hurting?
Are you hurt?
Stop it. Stop crying.
Use your dick.
Keep fucking.
Fuck everything that moves.
Just wear a condom.
Listen, I'm backed up,
I got a lot of kids.
I gotta go, okay?
You want something?
You want a balloon?
You want a lolly?
I just came.
Hi.
Hi.
Hi. Hi.
Hi.
Hi.
Hi.
Okay, do you mind
not saying that
over and over again?
You can gag me.
You brought a gag?
And handcuffs.
Do you wanna gag me?
Kind of, now.
What've we got today?
Just a walk
and talk at the lab.
That's what
will do to you:
What've we got here?
The victim's penis was found
behind the AC unit:
Ouch!
Can you say "dicksicle"?
Let's do this:
Okay, I'm ready.
The victim's penis
was found
behind the AC unit:
Just go with
the usual
stuff, maybe.
Something dark
and ominous.
Like losing
your penis
is a bad thing.
Oh, you want
dark and ominous.
Come on, I got
Allman Brother tickets,
I gotta get out of here!
That's what
will do to you:
What've we got here?
Peter! Peter,
Jesus Christ!
You're fucking
Billy Baldwin,
aren't you?
Aren't you?
Pete, Pete, Pete.
Stop staring at me.
Pete!
You know you're
not getting paid for
today's session, right?
I'm aware of that.
Fucking asshole.
Peter, it's Brian.
PETER: Go away.
Listen, your landlord
called me.
Said there's smoke
coming out
of your place.
Who, Mr. Lopez?
'Cause he's a liar!
He doesn't...
We worry
about you, Petey.
Yeah, come on, Peter.
Open up the door.
The fire marshal's
gonna come in
and bust it down.
You haven't been
out of the house
in two weeks.
PETER: Why are you
so damn strong?
PETER: I feel
so strong!
Hey, don't walk
away from me.
You come close.
Your place
is disgusting, Peter.
Hey, don't walk
away from me.
What are
you burning, man?
Come on.
It's everything.
It's everything
that reminds me of her
and I need it gone!
Okay, I thought
I was fine, Brian,
and I'm not.
I'm not fine at all.
Okay, let's just
put the picture down.
Put that down.
Let's discuss this.
I know. I love her, man.
Look, Liz and I,
we think the world
of Sarah.
We think she's great.
Okay, but everything...
I'm just
being honest here.
Every time
she would come over
to our house,
she always acted,
you know,
like a little bitch!
Okay, okay,
pump the brakes.
Dating Sarah is not
like dating Liz. Okay?
Sarah is better
than Liz.
You really wanna
have this conversation?
Do you really
wanna have
this conversation?
Yes.
She is the mother
of my unborn child. Sorry.
You're my stepbrother.
We're not even blood.
I have no qualms
with sticking you.
I will equalize you.
You dick! Sorry.
I'm just worked up.
You gotta get your shit
together, man.
I'm trying to.
It's so hard here.
Brian, everywhere I look,
I'm reminded of her, okay?
Like, she got me this,
okay, because
I would always leave
my cereal boxes open,
and the cereal
would get stale,
and so one day I came home,
and she had
this waiting for me,
because it keeps
my cereal fresh.
And now I have
the freshest cereal.
Why don't you,
you know what,
go on a vacation?
Go to the Alps.
Alps?
Go to Gstaad.
It's the best.
I could go to Hawaii.
Sarah was always talking
about this place in Hawaii
that was supposed to be nice.
No, don't.
I wouldn't go there.
What, I can't go
to Hawaii now,
because Sarah Marshall
has heard of Hawaii?
Then go to Hawaii.
Go to Hawaii.
Do it.
No, no, no,
don't destroy
the computer.
I'm just deleting
these pictures.
Okay, I need them
off my computer.
You know what?
You're not even doing
a proper permanent delete.
Well...
If we end up
getting back together,
I wanna have
a few of them left.
You're crazy.
No, no, please
don't delete them.
They have to go.
Done, done.
SARAH:
That was hilarious: Aloha!
I'm Sarah Marshall
from Crime Scene:
Scene of the crime.
And when I'm not scrubbing
for evidence, I'm flying
Hawaiian Airlines: : :
Excuse me! Hi.
: : : to my favorite
destinations: Mahalo:
Hi, can I have another
bloody mary, please?
You're still working
on that one.
It's just
an anticipatory order.
Okay, I'll be right back!
SARAH: What do you think
caused
such excessive bleeding?
HUNTER: He was either
stabbed in the aorta or
it was his time of the month:
Aloha!
Check in this way.
Just married?
Yes, how did
you guess?
Oh, you've got that
magic newlywed dust
all over you.
Oh, my wife.
Oh, my husband.
Oh, my wife. My husband.
My old ball and chain.
You quit squirming
and come here.
What is into you?
Not me, yet.
Here is your room key.
So you're all set.
Room 222.
Room key's inside,
and the elevators
are to the right.
Congratulations.
Here you go, sir.
Have some POG juice.
Welcome to Turtle Bay.
What can I do for you?
I'm checking in.
My name's Bretter,
Peter Bretter,
but actually,
I don't have
a reservation.
I just thought
I'd take my chances.
Bold!
We are all booked up,
but we do have
the Kapua suite available.
Okay.
How much is that?
$6,000 a night.
Beautiful views. Wow.
I can imagine.
That's a little bit
out of my price range.
Sorry.
That's a shame.
This is a beautiful
hotel.
Oh, yeah,
it's Sarah Marshall
from Crime Scene:
People are excited
that she's here.
She's my ex-girlfriend.
We broke up
three weeks ago.
I'm sorry, sir.
Right.
This is fine, right?
Sir?
It's totally fine.
Okay, there she is.
Did she see me?
Is she
coming over here?
Yup.
I wish I wasn't wearing
this fucking shirt.
Fair enough.
Why don't you try
to unbutton it?
Button it back up.
Peter! Hey.
Hi.
What are
you doing here?
Came here
to murder you.
Really, what are
you doing here?
I have been having
a tough time,
you know, back in LA.
But then I came here,
and here you are.
I just think
that's too crazy
to be...
Hello there,
you little sex object.
I've lost a shoe.
Have you seen
it anywhere?
It's like this one,
but, you know,
obviously it's
the opposite one.
Excuse me, missus,
I've lost a shoe.
Like this one.
It's like
this one's fellow.
Sort of the
exact opposite,
in fact, of that.
Not an evil version,
but just, you know,
a shoe like this,
but for
the other foot.
Otherwise,
I'd have two right...
Aldous, this is Peter.
Hey, all right, Peter.
Nice to meet you,
mate. Aldous.
Good to
meet you, man.
My ex-boyfriend.
Right. Hey,
I'm Aldous Snow.
I know who you are.
Yeah, you're very,
very famous.
Yeah, I am.
I am for my sins.
So are you
staying here,
as well?
I'm not,
as a matter of fact...
I'm sorry.
Excuse me,
Mr. Bretter,
Ms. Marshall,
but we were able to book
the Kapua suite for you,
sir, for four nights.
Yes, sir. You were?
Perfect. Marvelous.
Perfect amount of time.
Listen, if you wanna
have dinner with us
one of those nights...
Aldous... feel very...
PETER: No.
That's very gentlemanly
of you, but you two
enjoy your trip.
I'll be just fine
on my own.
ALDOUS: All right, Peter.
The Kapua suite...
Have a good trip, Pete.
I like your shirt.
It's colorful.
ALDOUS: Bye.
Bye now.
Ta-ta. I was wearing
two shoes
this morning, right?
Thank you.
Thank you
for bailing me out.
I still can't afford
that room.
Nobody can.
It's for, like, Oprah or,
like, Céline Dion.
Really, it's not
a big deal.
So you can stay in the suite,
but since you're
not technically a guest,
you have to clean up
after yourself.
Otherwise, here is
your room key
and enjoy your stay.
Why are you doing
this for me?
She's here with
some guy already?
Kind of messed up.
Yeah. Right?
Thank you.
Really, it's not a big deal.
Go enjoy yourself.
Rachel Jansen.
A thousand times,
thank you,
you know
what I mean...
Go enjoy yourself.
This is a disaster!
This is a disaster!
BRIAN:
Calm down, man:
Are there other hotels
on the island?
Of course
there are
other hotels,
but I'm not leaving here,
it'll look like
I'm running away.
Wait. Why are you whispering?
You're not
following them, are you?
I had
a girlfriend, right?
And Liam and Noel Gallagher
both had it off with her
right in front of me,
so that's similar.
And that was
a bit awkward,
actually.
So if you do wanna
change hotels,
I quite understand.
No, no, I'm not
changing hotels.
Stop following
and just go back
to your room, Peter.
They're gone!
Why are you looking for them?
I don't know.
You're acting like an idiot:
Run! Get out of there!
Go to your room!
What do you think
they're doing?
Peter, go:
Oh, God! Okay,
there they are.
There they are, I see them.
Go back to your room, Peter:
Peter, go back to your room.
Go back to your room, Peter.
I'm going in.
Go back to you room, Peter:
Are you listening to me?
Peter, go back to your room:
Peter, Peter, Peter: : :
Hey!
PETER: Hey, nice room.
BRIAN: Go!
I am in the Kapua suite.
BRIAN:
What are you doing?
Sucker!
Have fun.
BRIAN: Listen,
you piece of shit!
You're an idiot!
Back to
your room, Peter:
Peter, back to
your room:
Did you enjoy that?
Did you like what you saw?
That hurt a lot:
But I know Sarah,
and I'm pretty sure
I just ruined her day.
You know
how we thought
the killer masturbated
before he committed
each homicide?
That's the theory:
Take a look
at the microscope:
Oh, yeah, looks like
where he's going,
he'll need to know
how to masturbate:
Oh, God!
Hello.
RACHEL: Hey, Peter?
No. Sarah?
It's Rachel Jansen,
from the front desk.
Hey!
Hey, what's going on
up there?
I'm getting complaints
about a woman
crying hysterically.
Yeah, you know what,
I hear her, too,
and it sounds like
she's having
such a hard time.
I think it's coming from
the floor above me.
You're on the top floor.
I'll try to keep it down.
Are you okay?
Yeah, you have
a nice night.
Okay:
I would love to
sell you some weed, Jeremy,
but I'm at my
fucking job right now.
Obviously, because
you called me at work,
you know that
I'm at my place of work.
So I can't just leave here
and sell you some weed.
I can sell you some weed
when I'm done.
Hold on, I gotta
call you back.
Mahalo, all right.
Hey, how's it going?
Hey.
I'd just like to
grab some dinner,
please.
Okay, great.
Is your wife
gonna meet you?
No.
Your girlfriend?
No, I don't have
a girlfriend.
You're just by yourself?
Yeah.
Sucks.
Okay, so just one.
Here's your wine list
and your menu. Come on.
Do you want,
like, a magazine
or something?
It's gonna be boring
if you're just
sitting by yourself.
I'll be all right.
Thank you.
I just would be
so depressed.
Yeah. Here you go.
Thank you.
The best thing is,
you have the greatest
table in the house.
Oh, yeah?
That's Aldous Snow
right there.
I know. I know, dude.
I know.
I'm gonna ask him.
I'll ask him politely.
No, please don't,
please.
Mate!
Why don't you come over
and sit with us?
You'll be very welcome.
No, thank you.
I need a drink.
Would you guys
like a drink?
Well, no, actually,
because...
Seven years clean.
That's what
this tattoo denotes.
Seven years free
from drugs and alcohol.
If I have just
one sip of wine,
by the end of the evening,
I'll be, like, rimming
waiters for their tips
just to get me hands
on a rock.
You know
what I mean? Nasty.
I heard that.
Hey, what's up, man?
How are you enjoying
your vegetable medley?
It's mundane.
It is mundane.
It's great, I know.
Will you
marry me?
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Yes!
Beautiful. She said yes!
Congratulations!
I'm so excited!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Peter!
What's up?
Are you doing okay?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm good.
Look, did you follow me here?
Did my assistant
tell you I was coming?
Did you talk to her? No.
No, I didn't talk
to your assistant.
It's not all about you,
you know.
Hawaii is a beautiful place.
People come here,
usually not to follow you.
So you're really staying?
You're gonna stay?
Yeah, I think so.
I really like it here.
I feel at home here.
I just love it.
Yeah, you should stay.
I appreciate
your consideration.
Sounds like Aldous probably
shared a lot of needles,
so thank you for
dating him after me.
I appreciate that.
Hope you have
a really good time here.
Have a great dinner.
Thank you.
Groupie whore.
Psycho stalker.
You know what? It's vacation.
I think I'll just
take a piña colada, please.
You know what? It's vacation.
I think I'll just
take a piña colada, please.
Look at this guy.
Look at this guy.
Not us, buddy.
Right? Not us.
I'm on Sex and the City:
What's up, Miranda?
I'm Samantha.
I have sex with everyone.
Maybe it's a good thing
that they're here.
You know what I mean?
Maybe this is
a challenge from God
for me to forget her.
You know?
Or maybe it's a sign
from God that
you should be with her.
I love her show.
When they mix the sexuality
and the violence, I like it.
What the hell
is wrong with you two?
You gotta move on.
I hear you say that,
but it's not that easy.
It's that easy.
Promise you it is.
I lived
in South Central.
South Central.
And I hated it.
That's why
I moved to Oahu.
Now I can name you
over 200
different kinds of fish.
PETER: No, you can't.
Oh, yes, I can.
Yeah, you cannot. Do it.
G. Ghost pipefish,
grill fish, goaler fish,
grouper fish, greenback...
What's the state fish
of Hawaii?
Humuhumunukunukuapua'a.
Yeah, bitch.
Hey.
You ready?
Yeah, just
gonna close up.
Hello, Mr. Bretter,
Mr. Brayden.
Where's your wife, sir?
She is in bed.
How are things going
with the lady?
Not awesome.
She's complicated,
like The Da Vinci Code,
you know,
but harder to crack.
But life is full of lessons.
You learn something
new every day.
Wonder what I'm going
to learn tomorrow.
Well.
Good night, sir.
Good night.
Good night, sir.
BRAYDEN: Off to find
the mythical clitoris.
So, Peter, were you able
to get that crying lady
out of your room?
'Cause I could
send someone up,
if you want.
Oh, you could? Yeah.
That's very funny.
It is.
Well, listen,
Sarah Marshall Show sucks.
Who cares?
I do the music
for that program.
Did I mention
that the music rocks?
That's very sweet of you.
That's very
sweet of you to say.
You don't have to say that,
though. It's not music.
There's no melody,
it's just tones.
Just dark,
ominous tones.
"The masturbating
dog killer
is on the loose again.
"He'll kill the owner,
but at least
the dogs are happy."
I'm no Aldous Snow,
I guess, you know.
Time to start the music
All gonna light the light
Yeah, yeah, gonna get things
started on
The Muppet Show tonight
Whipped cream
or berry?
Whipped cream.
Here we are, sir.
Have a wonderful
breakfast.
What a lovely table,
so close to the buffet.
I'm glad
you like it.
Mahalo:
Good morning, sir.
Can I start you
with anything?
Orange juice, coffee?
What about, like, some
pineapple juice with a
little bit of rum on the side.
Of course.
I like your style.
Cocktail guy.
You are welcome. Thank you.
We've already reserved
the sea kayak for noon.
Honey, I know that,
but you know
that I wanted to see...
Hey. Hello there,
friend.
Hey.
How are you guys?
How was your evening?
Awesome. Great.
I can't feel anything.
All right.
Does that
feel good?
I still can't
feel anything.
Okay, 'cause
it hurts me.
Would you do that
for me?
Yeah.
Yeah.
No, no, no. No.
God put our mouths
on our head
for a reason. No!
I'm going to
the bathroom.
Okay.
Is everything okay with...
Waffles.
Here you go, sir.
Breakfast of champions.
Oh, thank you.
And don't tell anybody, but...
A little extra love for you.
Thank you.
Take it easy.
You, too.
Hi. Hi.
This is the yoga
place, yeah?
Yes. But there's
no alcohol allowed
in the studio.
Oh, no, I mean, obviously.
This is just pineapple juice.
Well, there's
no outside drinks
allowed in the studio.
Can I set it down? Sure.
Cool, thank you. I like your hat.
Thank you.
Please remove it
before class.
Hey, everyone,
why don't you all
grab your mats?
Sorry, I recognize you from
the cover of Namaste Magazine:
I'm a huge fan.
Thank you.
That's so sweet
of you to say.
I appreciate that.
Obviously, I don't do
yoga for recognition.
Right, of course
you wouldn't.
Then stop being
so good at it.
That's very flexible.
That's nice.
And, you,
I recognize you
from your show.
Thank you.
You seem much taller
on your show.
No, I know. I'm not.
Okay, if you just wanna
start by bringing
your palms into your chest.
Today we're gonna start
with the Surya Namaskar,
or Sun Salutation.
Let's take
a deep inhale in.
Exhale and
release the hands.
Inhale, arms up
to the sky.
Continue.
Good, exhale
and folding forward.
Strong, strong backs.
Good, excellent.
Remember this is
not a competition,
although you two seem
to be the best in the class.
Excellent. Perfect form,
you two, perfect.
Coming up into
downward-facing dog.
Good. It's really important
in this pose,
that you arch your back
and keep it flat
at the same time.
I feel like
those are opposing ideas.
No, they're not,
'cause you're arching
your back up while it's flat.
Okay.
Good, yeah, sweat it out.
Sweat out all the toxins
from this morning.
Come on, lady.
My name is Prana,
and I know
that wasn't just juice.
You don't really
need any adjusting,
so I'm just gonna
do this for myself.
Just to learn
from your body,
memorize your body.
Good.
Strong legs.
Come on.
Perfect skin and form.
Okay, class, I'd like
to now move into
a tripod headstand.
This is more of
an advanced pose,
so if you don't
feel comfortable
or strong enough,
please feel free
to just lay on your mat
in child's pose.
I got it.
All right,
so let's all come down
to our mats.
Get in a prep position
for the tripod headstand.
If you don't
feel comfortable,
there's no shame
in just laying on your mat
in child's pose.
PETER: Lady, I got it.
Okay.
Good, so let's prep
to come up. Good.
Sir, if you just want
to lay down
in child's pose.
Now, you all heard me say,
"If you want to
be in child's pose,
that's okay."
Just in case
he gets hurt.
Bring it, bring it.
I don't want you to
break your neck.
PETER: What's up?
Just relax.
My legs,
that's what.
We're doing
quiet headstands today.
I'm doing a handstand,
motherfucker!
I'm doing a handstand.
Okay, you know,
why don't we just release.
Thank God.
Good, everybody.
Good.
Hey.
Are you Chuck?
Oh, man, you know,
they won't
change that flyer.
That's my mainland name.
My Hawaiian
name is Koonu.
Cool, sorry.
No, it's all good.
Does Koonu have some, like,
cool Hawaiian meaning?
It means Chuck.
I plugged it
into a database.
There's a thing you can go on,
on the Internet,
you just type in your name,
and it just says it.
What's your name?
I'm Peter. Peter.
Yeah. I'm gonna give you
a Hawaiian name.
Oh, great.
Pepiopi.
Great.
Pepiopi, looks like
you've got
a little pain
behind those eyes.
Yeah, maybe a little.
There's really only
one cure for that.
What's that?
Weed. You got any?
No.
Well, then
let's go surfing.
Okay, when we're out there,
I want you to
ignore your instincts.
I'm gonna be your instincts.
Koonu will be your instincts.
Don't do anything.
Don't try to surf,
don't do it.
The less you do,
the more you do.
Let's see you pop up.
Pop it up!
That's not it
at all.
Do less. Get down.
Try less. Do it again.
Pop up.
No, too slow.
Do less.
Pop up.
Pop up.
You're doing too much.
Do less. Pop down.
Pop up now.
Stop! Get down.
Get down there.
Remember,
don't do anything.
Nothing. Pop up.
Well, you...
No, you gotta do
more than that,
'cause you're just
laying right out.
It looks like
you're boogie-boarding.
Just do it.
Feel it.
Pop up.
Yeah. That wasn't quite it,
but we're gonna
figure it out, out there.
Let's go surfing,
come on.
Everybody's learning
how, come on and...
The weather outside
is weather
PETER: How long
you lived out here?
Man, I don't know.
I quit wearing a watch
when I moved out here.
Wow, that's so cool.
Yeah.
No, like my cell phone
has a clock on it,
so I don't really need it.
Right, so it's basically
the same thing.
How old are you?
I don't really believe
in age or numbers,
you know, I don't...
I mean, if you had
to put a number on it,
I guess
I'd be 44.
Fuck!
Thanks for
taking me out here.
This is the first time
I've felt good
in three weeks or so.
You need to get back
on that board
is what you need to do.
Hey, here's the deal. Yeah?
When life gives you lemons,
just say,
"Fuck the lemons,"
and bail.
Yeah. No.
You said it, totally.
You gotta just
pull yourself up
by your wetsuit,
get back on that board...
Hey, look, man,
if you're attacked
by a shark,
are you gonna
give up surfing?
Probably, yeah.
Let's go in, all right.
Tacos are on me.
Can you try to listen
to what I'm saying
to you, Brian?
I'm confused
and I don't know
what to do.
What's up with that hat?
What are you
in the Buena Vista
Social Club?
This is a nice hat.
What member of
the Brat Pack are you?
You look like one
of those guys
suspected of killing JFK:
That's very funny.
That's great.
LIZ: Tell him
to make friends:
You need to get out there
and make some friends, man:
Is Liz there right now?
No, no, she's not
in here, buddy:
I just heard her.
She's gone:
Who are you looking at?
What?
Is she still... Hi, Liz.
No: I swear on
my mother's grave, it: : :
Okay, it was Liz:
She wasn't here
the entire time:
Go out and meet people:
We meet people
all the time: : :
All the time on vacation:
Constantly:
I've tried, all right,
there's a couple
of dudes here,
but they're kind of weird.
Just be friendly:
Iron your shirt:
Iron your shirt,
look sharp:
Even your T-shirts:
There is this girl
at the front desk
who's pretty cute.
Oh, yeah: You know what?
Go have another
dirty one night stand:
That worked out
so well before:
What do you want from me?
You just told me
I need to meet people.
Ask her out:
Maybe that's what
he needs, is a rebound:
BRIAN: He's had
plenty of chances
for rebounds: This isn't: : :
LIZ: Can we get on
the same team here?
Okay, I'm sorry:
We're on the same team:
Sorry:
LIZ: You should go
on a date with this girl:
Well, maybe
I'll ask her out then.
LIZ: Yes: My wife says so.
Hey, I'm in Hawaii, too!
LIZ: Oh, that's neat:
Aloha, bitches!
That's very cool.
They're not
Native Americans, Brian.
Bri...
What are you doing?
The luha:
Is that right?
Oh, yeah:
It's called the hula:
Luau? No, hula.
You're doing a luau?
Hey. PETER: Hey.
Peter. Wow.
You look beautiful.
I mean, that's
a beautiful dress.
Thank you. Yeah.
This'll be fun.
May I help you
with something else, Peter?
No, I'll just grab a drink.
I'm just gonna head inside.
Happy 4th of July!
Thank you.
Aloha!
You done here?
No, actually, I just sat down,
I'm just getting started.
It's delicious,
though, thank you.
I'll just go
fuck myself.
Mahalo. Sorry, what?
SARAH: Hi, Peter.
Hey. Hey, bro.
Hi. Hey, all right.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Everybody, can I have
your attention
for one second, please.
We have a very special guest
with us here, today.
He is the lead singer
of the band,
Infant Sorrow,
one of my favorite musicians
of all time.
He's so awesome.
Please, please,
let's take...
Let's see if we can get him
up here, Mr. Aldous Snow.
Please, come on.
Share your gift.
Duty calls
and all that.
I'm trying to be
incognito, it's weird.
It's like work to me,
this is no fun.
Hey! Thank you!
ALDOUS: Thank you.
What a lovely introduction.
What an eccentric
and confident young man.
I'd like to dedicate this song
to a very beautiful woman
that's here today.
It's Miss Sarah Marshall,
there she is.
Look at her, blimey!
Old as ancient skies
I've had these wandering eyes
but you took me by surprise
when you let me inside you
Inside you
Inside you
This went from
Teach me how to grow
while I'm moving
inside of you
Inside of you
Inside you Inside you
I long to be,
is it wrong to be
inside of you
Inside of you the restless
find their dreams
Inside of you
this king has found his queen
Hey.
You're from
the breakfast
buffet, right?
Yeah. Whipped cream
or berries?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm Peter.
Kemo. Kemo.
Good to
meet you, man.
Good to
meet, you, man.
Have a beer.
Thanks. Thank you.
Sarah Marshall.
Yes.
How do you know
I was dating
Sarah Marshall?
Dwayne told me.
Chuck told me.
Even Rachel told me.
I heard about it
from everybody.
You gotta stop
talking about it.
It's like The Sopranos:
It's over.
Find a new show.
You need a hug.
Come here.
Oh, thank you.
You're awfully nice.
I gotta go.
I'm prepping the pig
for tomorrow's luau:
You should come and help me.
It'll take your mind
off of things.
No. Yeah? You don't mind?
I mean, I must say
I'm a pretty good cook.
All right!
I can't! Please don't
make me do this!
Do it!
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
KEMO: You can stop
crying now.
He's dead already.
I'm not crying.
You should stop crying.
I don't cry.
I'm not a baby.
Really?
'Cause you look like
a gigantic baby.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean
that at all.
Hey.
Listen, would you like to
hang out tonight, like, not
in an official hotel function?
Yeah. Totally.
A bunch of us are going to
go to this, like,
little beach thing afterwards.
You're totally welcome
to come.
Maybe we could
go together?
Yeah, whatever.
I mean we don't have to,
if you don't want to,
I just thought
that maybe...
No, listen,
you don't have
to make this weird.
You either want to go
or you don't.
I would love to. Okay.
Awesome.
Why don't you go upstairs,
change that shirt,
and I'll meet you
out front in,
like, five?
This is so cool.
You like it?
So what brought
you to Hawaii?
A dude.
Of course.
A surfer dude.
You know, WCT,
top 44.
Totally.
We were together
for two years.
Dropped out of school,
moved out here with him.
Three weeks later,
I caught him
cheating on me,
so I moved out,
and that's that.
What an asshole.
No, he's just a boy.
You ever think about
going back home,
finishing school, or...
No.
No. I work
at the hotel,
doesn't really have to
be a future in there.
Okay, my turn.
Okay.
So, how do you like
writing music
for a TV show?
It's great, you know.
People are great.
It's great to have
a steady paycheck.
It's... I'm very lucky.
Oh, my God, you hate it.
I fucking hate it
so much.
So then, do something
about it.
Excuse me.
I'm just saying,
if you hate something,
change it.
Don't dwell. Well, I'm trying.
I'm actually working
on a rock opera.
Yeah? Yeah.
What's your
rock opera about?
Dracula.
Yeah, and eternal love,
you know.
That's the theme.
But I think
the two sort of go
hand in hand, you know?
And I...
I have this vision
of doing it with puppets.
I mean, humans also,
you know.
Why Dracula?
Because he's a man
like anyone else.
He just wants to be loved.
And every time
he gets close
to a human woman,
he ends up
smothering
and killing her,
which is a feeling
I am familiar with.
What?
That's just a joke.
Oh, shit. What?
My ex.
If I run, you run.
Do you understand?
No, I don't understand at all.
Fucking motherfucker!
Dipshit!
Rachel,
what are you doing?
I thought I told you
to stay back
on your island.
Take it easy,
just take it easy.
Yeah, you know what?
The deal
was over April 9.
Well, the deal's back on,
motherfucker.
You ain't the chief
in this village.
I'm the chief.
Of the idiots?
Rachel, let me handle this.
I know his friend.
Let me handle this, okay?
Go ahead.
Hey, man, you remember
me from breakfast?
Oh, yeah,
the cocktail guy,
that's right.
Yeah.
This ain't the
breakfast buffet.
What, you with my girl?
Keeping her warm for me
at night, huh?
Hey, what are
you doing here?
That's right.
Just hit him!
Rachel, we gotta get
out of here. Rachel?
You get
what you deserve.
Just a boy?
No, that dude
was a fucking man.
No, no, no. He's an asshole.
I can't believe
I ever dated him.
Yeah. You went nuts.
You guys
are dysfunctional.
You were like one of
those girls
from Flavor of Love:
From what? You were.
"I'll kill you.
I'll kill you."
Okay, I'm gonna go
get us another round.
I'll grab it.
It's no big deal.
You don't have to
dote on me.
I'm not that type of girl.
You look so hot.
Give me Crime Scene:
Give me dirty
Crime Scene girl.
André the Giant,
out of the shot, please.
Mutombo, out of
the shot, come on.
Did you know
that there's a picture
of you flashing,
hanging in
the men's room?
Yeah. I hate it so much.
My jackass boyfriend
made me do it.
Keoki took it,
right there.
And I asked him
to take it down,
but he said that
it would ruin the balance
of the collage.
Do you want me to try
to get it down for you?
No. No, no, no,
he'll kill you.
Like, really kill you.
But I have
a surprise for you.
Really, what?
MAN: We're gonna
take a quick break.
Tonight we have
a special guest
from the mainland,
singing a song
from his Dracula musical,
please welcome
to the stage,
Mr. Peter Bretter.
Peter!
Yeah!
Go get them,
tiger!
Please don't.
Peter!
Dracula! Peter! Rachel...
Get them!
What's up?
Thank you.
You know, I could play
something else.
I just think out of
context this might be...
RACHEL: Dracula musical!
Thank you.
It's getting
kind of hard to believe
things are going to get better
I've been drowning
too long to believe
that the tide's going to turn
And I've been living too hard
to believe things
are going to get easier now
I'm still trying to
shake off the pain from
the lessons I've learned
And if I see Van Helsing,
I swear to the lord
I will slay him
Take it from me, but I swear
I won't let it be so
Blood will run down his face
when he is decapitated
His head on my mantle
is how I will
let this one know
How much I love you
Die
Die
Die
I can't
RACHEL: Awesome!
PETER: Thank you.
Thank you.
So, I had a really,
really great time tonight.
Yeah. I mean, Yeah?
it got a little wild.
"A little"?
Yeah. You can say that.
But it was really fun,
and you're so cool,
and it was...
Thank you
for taking me out.
No, I had a great time.
Thank you.
You did? Yeah.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry,
I just... I don't...
I just don't wanna
complicate things.
No, of course! Yeah?
No, no, no. Totally.
I totally get that.
I had a great time.
A handshake?
Well, I don't know.
Okay.
All right, all right.
All right.
Get home safe.
You, too.
Thanks again. Bye.
ALDOUS:
I'm on a hammock
with me lady
Watching the sea roll by
Things have been great now
'Cause we're in Hawaii
Hey, guys.
Hey, man.
I'm Koonu.
Yeah. No, I remember.
I'm Peter.
We took a surf lesson
together.
Yeah, you're that guy
that works with
Kaiser Permanente.
No, I'm Peter.
We had a nice talk
out on the water.
That's cool.
Okay, can I just
say something?
I went on a date
tonight with
Rachel, right?
That wasn't a date.
She's in
customer service, dude.
She took you out
for charity.
It was a date, okay?
Trust me. I know a date,
and that was a date.
I bet you think
strippers like you, too.
That's really not necessary.
It's true.
Don't waste your time, man.
Believe me,
it is a nowhere road. I know.
Did you see
her ex-boyfriend?
He is ridiculous.
Who, Greg?
I love Greg, man.
I saw him beat up a guy
with a starfish.
Okay, that's
just ridiculous.
That guy was me.
Dude, my homie over here,
on his honeymoon?
Getting as much sex
as he possibly can
ever have.
Are you giving to her
hard and rough, dude?
Come on.
The wife wants me to
do certain things
that I find inappropriate.
Let me just say
that if God
was a city planner,
he would not put
a playground
next to a sewage system.
We're trying to fuck,
but we're not
having fun fucking.
We're just, like...
I'm stabbing
her private parts,
and it's not fun,
and it causes anxiety.
Fucking is...
And then when
you're not fucking...
PETER: Hey, someone's
gotta stop him.
You're the butt
of a joke.
Fucking this ring is...
Fuck!
It's gonna
be all right.
Hi.
Hi, do you wanna
come back to bed?
Sure.
Have fun.
I like her hair.
I wonder if the carpet
matches her pubes.
Julian, what's up?
God.
The show's been canceled.
That's good,
'cause that's what
you wanted.
Yeah. Yeah, it is.
It's just... I guess
I thought we had
another year left.
It seems like we did, and...
This'll be good,
'cause it's been
a long-awaited transition
into film for me.
Don't get me wrong,
but it's just...
It's a surprise.
Come on tour with me.
I'll serenade you
every night in front of
thousands of women.
I didn't know
you were going on tour.
Yeah, I'm going
in two weeks.
It's like an 18-month tour,
and it's gonna be
a massive tour.
Yeah. I can't come
'cause I have a job.
I'm a working actress.
Not anymore.
You're an unemployed
actress, perfect.
You could be the queen
of the groupies,
queen of the Sorrow Suckers.
The Sorrow Suckers.
Sorrow Suckers.
I don't know
why they call them that.
Mr. and Mrs. Snow, sorry.
Sorry to bother you.
The hotel wanted to
offer you some
complimentary coconut cake.
It's from the hotel.
It's definitely not
from me personally, so...
Yeah, thanks.
Okay, great.
When were you planning
on telling me this?
I just
told you, then.
Yeah. No, I know.
But telling me now
isn't really the same
as telling me.
Well, look, you know,
I've not told you
I've got genital herpes,
because it's not inflamed
at the moment.
Do you guys
want some champagne
with your cake,
or do you want it
without your cake?
ALDOUS: I don't drink.
All right, so I came here
to give you
my demo. I just...
I worship you,
and I just wanted to
give you my demo.
Just take a listen and...
Okay.
'Cause you know what?
You don't wanna be
the guy sitting there,
watching BBC,
and saying,
"Oh, I saw that guy!
He was my waiter,
"and I totally dismissed him
like everyone else
does in his life.
"And I totally was wrong,
"because he's a major,
major, major
influence on me now,
"and I feel terrible!"
That stupid English voice,
was that me?
Unfortunately, yes.
You're really
gonna like it.
I'll listen to it
when you've gone.
Hey, look,
just don't tell
anyone at the hotel.
What's up, dude?
What's up?
Peter, I got some
really interesting news
this morning.
Aldous gave you
gonorrhea?
No. Why would
I tell you that?
Crime Scene was cancelled.
Whoa!
Wow.
You all right?
Yeah. Yeah.
I mean, I've been waiting
to take the next step,
you know, into features
for a long time,
so it's a really good thing.
This isn't The View:
I mean, we can have an honest
talk about this if we want.
I don't wanna step out
of the spotlight
and then be forgotten.
I don't wanna disappear.
I'm freaked out.
I wanna be honest.
I'm really freaked out
right now, okay?
Because, seemingly,
the only actresses that
actually can survive
are the ones that show
their cooter, and, excuse me,
but I refuse to do that.
I have a little dignity.
And I don't have the frame
to support plastic surgery.
I would tip over.
And I'm not gonna do that.
I'm not gonna
exploit myself.
Listen, you're gonna be fine.
You have a long career
ahead of you.
You've got, like,
four years
until you're 30.
It's gonna be fine.
How are you?
I'm screwed.
Frankly, I don't
stand a chance.
No, I'll be fine.
I've been quietly
stealing money from you
for a long time.
You're always good
at cheering me up,
Pete, thank you.
Die
Die
Die
I can't
It's really good, Peter.
I just don't
understand it. I don't.
I mean, just
chalk it up to that.
Please don't
play it again,
'cause I don't...
Just listen to it
one more time and see...
Where's Aldous?
BRAYDEN: Mr. Snow,
may I ask you
a question?
ALDOUS: Okay.
I want to
please my wife here,
on our honeymoon,
but I don't know
what I'm doing.
You having difficulty
sex-wise?
Do you not know
how to use this?
I know how.
Have you had
sex before?
We can't.
Why? Our religion.
Right, 'cause of God
and everything?
Hey, that's not
gonna be a problem,
because God
should be present
in the bedroom.
Just tell me
specifically
what I need to do.
You need to penetrate
deeply and stimulate
the clitoris simultaneously.
That's what you gotta do.
That's what it's about.
If you can involve the anus
in that, then that's
absolute perfection.
Got it.
Explore her ears.
Find it in you to be
a little more circly.
You are a man.
God's within you.
I actually feel okay
about it.
You know, I'm a little scared,
but I'll be all right.
I'll get another job.
That's interesting, man:
You know what else
is interesting?
What?
Me on the moon:
I just wanna talk to you
about something.
Can you stop?
All right, I'm just gonna
talk, and then...
Air!
There was this
interesting moment
with Sarah.
Whoa, what? I don't wanna hear
about your interesting
moment with Sarah, Pete:
Then who am I
supposed to talk to
about this?
Well, not me, because have
I ever had an interesting
moment with an ex-girlfriend?
Do you have
an ex-girlfriend? No!
No:
LIZ: No:
I would really love to get
the woman's perspective
on the matter.
No. Really?
But come on in
and just sit down.
Stay:
You have to: : :
Honey, no, no,
the camera's
right there:
No, I know,
but I just wanna
tell him, though:
No, the camera: : :
Think about how much
she's hurt you:
Hey, Liz?
Yeah?
I think you need to move just
a tiny bit further away
from the microphone.
No, closer. Just: : :
Now a little further.
Okay:
Closer. And then...
And then a little further,
and then closer.
I don't know:
Keep your head down, though.
I'm bad at this thing:
Can you hear me?
Yeah, closer.
Further away.
I know what you're doing:
That's not funny at all:
What? You stop that:
What's he doing?
Come on:
Yeah, yeah, real funny:
Hey, that's
a great necklace, Liz.
Did you have that
a second ago?
Thank you!
That's gross!
LIZ: I don't get it: Stop it.
He's saying
if I were to sperm on you: : :
What?
: : : it would be
a pearl necklace:
Why?
Real funny:
Sorry.
Hey, Dracula!
"And when I see Van Helsing,
I swear to the Lord,
I'll slay him."
That shit is funny, dude!
Hey, Pete.
So I was gonna go over
to Lazy Joe's later tonight,
and I wanted to see
if you wanted to
come and join.
I think I'm confused,
because I thought
last night...
Oh, my God. Dude,
get out of your head.
It's really nice out here.
Yeah, I bet it is.
All right, yeah.
You know what?
I could totally use
a friendly hangout, so...
All right.
I don't know if you want,
instead of Lazy Joe's,
I was thinking of going
to Laie Point right now.
Really? Yeah.
I heard that place
was a pain in the ass.
RACHEL: Okay.
RACHEL: Hey!
DWAYNE: Yo, what's up, guys?
We're just going
for a hike.
No, you're not,
you're going
snorkeling.
PETER: I think
we're gonna go on a hike.
DWAYNE: It is sea turtle
fucking season,
dude. Let's go.
They fuck for
three hours, dude.
I mean, that's magical.
No, we're going on a hike.
I think we'll go on
a hike, yeah.
What? Your loss.
Why won't anybody
go snorkeling with me?
How you doing
back there?
Awesome.
I don't think
I've ever been this covered
in sweat before.
It's like I have
some sort of fever.
I told you this was
a pain in the ass.
Could've been
at Lazy Joe's.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, shit.
You good? No.
PETER: Wow, we're really
going up to
the edge of this, huh?
Look!
Wow, this is
really beautiful.
All right, so now that
your show's done,
are you gonna finish
the Dracula musical?
It's not that easy,
you know.
Sarah always thought
it was crazy, and...
Well, you're definitely crazy.
But so is everyone, right?
So who cares?
I just don't feel
like doing anything.
Why?
'Cause my heart
is broken,
and I can't imagine
doing anything
right now.
It's probably the same reason
you don't go back
to school, you know?
Maybe it's good
we got hurt like that,
you know?
I don't know about you,
but it makes me
feel impervious to pain.
Yeah. Kind of like
there's nothing left
to be afraid of.
Yeah. No, exactly.
Right.
We could leap off this rock,
and it won't hurt us
as bad as they did.
So jump, then.
No, I meant that,
like, as a metaphor,
you know?
No. Just do it.
You'll be fine. Jump.
What the hell?
Oh, God! Oh, God.
I made her kill herself!
You must be crazy!
So are you gonna
jump or what?
No!
Come on, Peter!
I can see your vagina
from here!
I can see your hoo-ha.
I mean, I'll jump!
Chicken! Come on!
Please, God,
don't let me die today.
I'm okay! Okay!
I'll just let go,
right?
No, no, no!
If you fall straight down,
you'd probably hit a rock
and kill yourself!
Totally. Yeah.
So what do I do?
Why don't you
press your feet
up against the rock,
and, like,
shoot yourself off!
What, like a frog?
I don't know, Peter!
Just get off
the fucking rock!
Here I go!
Okay!
PETER: One!
Two!
Two!
Two and a half!
Jump!
Three!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
You saw that, right?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I saw it!
I was there.
I witnessed it.
Thanks.
Come on.
You've got Christ
between your thighs,
but with
a shorter beard.
Mahalo!
Aloha!
Sex!
I'm cramping,
I'm cramping.
Okay.
Okay, okay.
Petey? Petey?
Sorry. I knocked a bunch.
You were really out.
Ken sent me.
Dakota Fanning
and her people,
they need this room.
She loves it here.
So does that mean
I have to leave the hotel?
Ken found you a room.
I'll take it, yeah.
I wanna hang out
with Rachel a little more.
Are those sad tissues
or happy tissues?
Maybe you should
just give me a minute.
It was the only
room available!
I'm sure it was!
Hey, how's it going?
It's all right.
Really?
I think you got some pain
behind those eyes.
A kind of pain that only...
Okay, you know what?
Let's cut the bullshit.
I wanna stand up
on a wave
before I leave.
I don't think
you're ready yet, man.
I'm ready to
ride giants, Koonu.
I think you're ready.
Petey!
Hi. Hi.
Miss Marshall,
what can I do for you?
Is there a place
to get good sushi
around here?
Yeah. Yeah, there's
a really great place
about five minutes
from here called Asuki.
Perfect.
Do you want me
to get you a map? Please.
Okay.
So, this is
where we are.
Head down Kamehameha,
and then pass
Funaho Loko Marsh.
And it should be
right to the left.
It might take, like,
five minutes.
Great. Thank you.
Any time.
I saw you
with Peter Bretter...
Yeah.
...who's my ex-boyfriend.
Oh, my God.
I'm really sorry.
It's not like that at all. No.
It's not what you're... No, it's fine.
I'm just really glad
you're keeping
him company, 'cause...
Gosh, no.
...you seem like
a really nice person...
Thank you.
...and you're
very pretty.
Gosh, you're,
like, way prettier.
No, you're, like,
so pretty.
Really?
Yeah.
Wow, thank you.
Thank you.
And one more thing
about Peter.
He's a really good guy.
Really good.
Like, great, actually.
Yeah.
Please don't cry,
Miss Marshall.
God. Do you need me
to get you a tissue?
Oh, no, I'm good, I'm good.
I'm okay, I'm okay.
Okay.
Thank you, Rachel.
Any time, Miss Marshall.
Hey, ahoy, there!
You surf, too?
Good Lord, no.
I'm just drifting
around, you know?
Getting in touch
with the ocean and stuff.
It's really pleasant.
It was, yeah.
I'm gonna head in.
Before you go,
actually, Peter,
I just wanted to tell you,
I was listening
to Sarah's iPod
the other day,
and amidst the interminable
dross that's on that thing,
I found one track
that I quite liked.
So I checked what it was,
and it was
actually one of yours.
And it kind of reminded me
of a dark, gothic
Neil Diamond. It's great.
That's, like, exactly
what I'm going for.
Right, yeah.
Fuck.
Fuck, you're cool.
It's so hard to say,
because, like,
I hate you in so many ways,
but whatever.
I can see why
Sarah likes you.
No accounting for taste,
I suppose.
In her case, anyway.
She was with me
for five years,
so there you go.
Yeah, you got
four on me there, mate.
You slept with Sarah
a year ago?
I thought you knew!
Peter, please,
don't take it seriously.
What the fuck, man!
You've...
Don't get offended
by that.
You can't be so casual
about this!
This isn't Europe, okay?
There are rules here.
I'm really sorry.
I apologize
for offending you, Peter.
I just hope this doesn't
ruin our friendship.
Well, what's
that about?
What do you think
it's about?
This is a big deal!
What about a code
of the ocean?
That's not on.
What about
codes among men?
You don't sleep
with another
man's girlfriend!
Think of... Get out of here!
All right, okay!
All right!
Get out of here!
Oh, God!
PETER: Koonu!
This guy needs help!
Koonu!
Should I call
the front desk?
It hurts.
It hurts.
Wow, you got coral
right there in your leg!
Can you get it out
of my leg, please,
hotel man?
Can you do something
about that?
I'd love to, you know,
but hotel policy...
They don't let me
do that kind of thing.
They get all weirded out.
Insurance...
Koonu, can you call
the front desk for me,
please?
Yeah.
ALDOUS: It really hurts.
Koonu, call
the front desk now!
Okay, monster man.
Pete, he's not
gonna do nothing.
I kind of have this thing
about blood, okay?
Look at it.
It's raping my leg.
Peter, get it out of
my fucking leg, please!
One, two.
You can't get it out.
It's really in there.
Get it out of me!
Three!
Fuck my arse!
Okay, I got it.
It's all done.
It's all over.
Everything looks fine.
It's all good!
They're coming wiki wiki:
Can you get some
towels for me, please?
I'm really losing
a lot of blood.
You sound like
you're from London.
Yeah, I'm from London.
What's going on?
You fainted.
I didn't want you to
wake up by yourself.
How's your friend?
Is he all right?
Yeah.
They gave him stitches,
and he's sleeping it off.
Hey, you wanna hear
something funny?
What?
Are you ready to laugh?
'Cause this is a gas.
Okay.
Edward Scissorhands over there
told me that you two
were fucking each other
for a whole God damn year
while we were together.
Shit.
How about that, Sarah?
I'm sorry, Peter.
Pete, you shouldn't be up
and walking around.
Can you please...
Please don't touch me.
Just don't
touch me, okay?
I'm not touching you.
Will you just please sit?
Please?
All right, I'll sit down,
but I'm sitting down
'cause I want to,
not because
you've asked me
to sit, okay?
Great.
A year?
Listen, I get it,
okay? I just...
I need to understand
what I did to
make you cheat. I just...
Pete, it's not
anything you did.
You didn't do anything.
I mean, you were great.
Will you please
cut the bullshit and
have a talk with me?
Fine. Cutting
the bullshit.
It got really hard
to keep
taking care of you
when you stopped
taking care of yourself.
I tried to get you
out of the house.
I tried to get you off
your little island
you loved so much, the couch.
You didn't wanna see
the light of day!
God, there was one week
when you wore
sweatpants! Every day.
You shall not pass!
You know what?
If they were Sean John
sweatpants,
it would have been fine.
But because they're
Costco brand, it's like
the worst thing I could do.
That has nothing
to do with it.
That's what you don't get.
I'm sorry that
I didn't end up
being who we thought
I was gonna be,
you know?
I tried really hard.
I promise you that.
I just didn't have it in me.
I think if you had just,
maybe tried harder.
I tried!
You have no idea
how hard I tried, Peter.
I talked to a therapist.
I talked to my mother.
I read every book possible.
I took love seminars.
I took sex seminars.
None of it worked.
None of it
made a difference to you.
And I couldn't drown
with you anymore.
Don't you dare sit there
and tell me
that I didn't try.
I did.
You were just
too stupid to notice.
Whoa. I thought
you were gonna wear
the shirt I got you.
What? No.
I mean, I do love
that shirt you got me.
I admire Sir Tommy Bahama
an awful lot.
He's a talented man,
but tonight, I feel
that this is appropriate.
Wow, thank you.
Yeah, Sarah
got it for me.
This is, like,
way more convenient
than my backpack.
Awesome hat!
Thank you.
Yeah, my girlfriend
got it for me!
I'm fucking with you!
Cool!
Sarah, can I use
this lipstick, please?
Sure. I don't care.
I think it looks great.
But if you're not,
let's go change.
No, I like it.
I didn't like it
at first.
Now I really
think it's...
Oh, bloody hell.
This is a small resort.
SARAH: Hi, Peter.
Hey. Wow.
Aldous, Sarah,
this is Rachel.
Sarah bought me
this shirt.
I could've
guessed that. Yeah.
Looks great. You look great.
Looks awesome.
Thanks. See.
Mr. Snow, I'm so sorry.
I did not know
you guys were coming.
You're gonna have to
wait five minutes.
I did not know
you guys were coming.
It's okay.
It's not a problem.
I didn't see you guys, so...
ALDOUS: There's really
no need to weep.
I'm not crying.
It's no problem,
honestly.
It's not a problem.
So, your table
is ready, guys.
Oh, great.
Hey, have
a lovely evening,
you two.
Thank you. Have a great
dinner, you guys. Thank you.
You're welcome
to join us, obviously,
if you want.
Wouldn't dream Okay.
of it. What?
What?
Oh, okay. Okay.
RACHEL: That's great. Awesome.
Sure.
Great.
I'll just set
two more places.
Not a big deal. Okay.
Awesome.
So this is actually happening.
We're gonna let this happen.
I am so sorry.
I never thought
in a million years
she would say yes.
I did.
What? I just accepted
an invitation.
I didn't wanna be rude.
It's got us
in a terrible situation.
Now I'm gonna have to
sit with him wearing
this shirt all night.
You're wearing
the shirt regardless.
Australia is amazing.
I'm telling you.
It is a great place
to shoot.
Yeah?
Rachel, you would love it.
You would love it.
I wanna go.
I really, really
wanna go there.
Wait, so when's
the movie coming out?
It came out.
It was already released.
Oh.
Well, you know,
it's an island.
It's isolated.
Movies don't really Yeah.
come out here.
Obviously.
Did you like it?
Yeah. The movie?
It was...
Awful bloody film.
I say, it's just
a ridiculous premise.
What would happen
if your mobile phone
killed you?
Why would a mobile phone
kill anyone?
Doesn't make sense.
How can a mobile phone
have an agenda
and kill people...
I told her that
when she
read the script.
Yeah. You were
the voice of
reason, mate.
I tried to be,
but she didn't listen.
Going around killing people.
A mobile phone,
like, doing murders.
Why couldn't
you just take the battery
out of the phone?
ALDOUS: Right. That's it.
The battle's over.
Yeah, we've won. I hated it.
Well, it's not for
everyone, but it...
No, it's ridiculous.
Here's my favorite scene.
Ring-ring. Hello?
ALDOUS: Right.
It would never happen.
Yeah.
No, it could never happen.
It's a metaphor
for addiction to technology.
For society,
for how we're reliant
on technology.
I get it. I'm with you.
It's a metaphor
for a crap movie.
Well, it was the right choice
for me at the time.
RACHEL: Sure. You know?
Well, this is awkward.
Yeah?
It's a bit
more awkward now.
RACHEL: A little.
Hey, excuse me.
Can we get another
bottle of wine, please?
Sure.
Thank you.
Mr. Snow?
Can I get cranberry juice
with a bit of
lime in it, please.
Do you want cranberry juice
or cranberry cocktail?
Because I can probably
rustle up either one.
Throw some OJ...
I don't care.
Okay, great.
Hey, can we get
another bottle of wine?
If I've learned anything
from addiction,
it's that,
you know, life is as brief
as the twinkling
of a star over all too soon.
So if you're in a situation
where you're with a woman,
why not do the most
interesting thing that
you can do in that situation?
And by which, I don't mean
have a conversation,
have a chin-wag,
a bit of a chat.
Lose yourself in something
that's both
ancient and perennial.
Find something eternal,
perpetual.
Lose yourself in fuck.
I'm going to disagree.
Respectfully,
of course, sir.
Maybe for you,
that works.
For me, it's much more
enjoyable to get
to know somebody.
If you end up
sleeping with them,
that's great.
But I like getting
to know somebody.
But he...
What he's saying is that
he's gonna stick it
wherever he wants,
but he's joking.
I ain't.
No, I'm not joking.
It's just what
I believe, really.
So...
Just so we're clear and so
I can hone in on your
central thesis of the night,
wade through
all the bullshit,
you're telling me
that you think
you have the right
to just fuck anyone,
anywhere, anytime?
Yes. There it is.
That's right.
That's what you're saying?
Not so eloquently
as you just put it,
sweetheart.
But ultimately,
yes, that is...
Oh, no! Not the shirt!
Take my eyes,
but not the shirt.
Yeah, that's pretty much
what I believe, Sarah.
When you're done making jokes,
are you gonna get a napkin?
Do you know what?
I think I've improved it,
actually,
against all odds.
I think I deserve
a design award.
Please get
some seltzer water.
Garçon, could we
get some...
I saw it from
farther away.
Okay.
Just lean back for a second.
No, it's all right.
It's not there.
Let me...
You're very diligent.
I appreciate it.
Let go of the glass now.
You're gonna
have to walk away.
Bless you.
There you are.
Oh, me, oh, my.
Oh, good. Call the doctor.
I love Hawaii.
RACHEL: Is it good?
Yeah, it's nice,
but I think for
like a week tops.
Any more than that,
I know I'd go crazy,
because I think that
Hawaii is a place
to escape
for people who can't deal
with the real world.
Yeah, you know, there's
so few personal shoppers
and pet therapists.
Gosh, it's such
a hard life.
I like living here.
Anyone need
any more vino?
I think we're good.
I've a question
for you
real quick, Mr. S.
I was actually meaning
to ask you, what did
you exactly think of my demo?
Did you get it?
Did you get it?
Oh, no. I was gonna
listen to that,
but then I just carried on
living my life.
Not at all?
No, I didn't,
because, you know,
I go on my instincts,
and they weren't good.
You know what, dude?
Fuck you, okay?
You can go fuck yourself.
I can't yell right now
because I'll get fired.
My boss will hear me,
and then I won't
be able to pay off
my student loans.
But you know what?
You're an asshole.
I fucking hate you.
I bought all your records.
This whole fucking time,
I've been trying to get you
to come hang out with me.
I'm gonna have people
fuck with your food
the rest of your trip,
you fucking dick!
I like him.
That was quite moving.
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.
Are you sure
that you're not,
like, too drunk?
Jesus, would you stop
being so sensitive.
Aldous.
Wake up.
Aldous. Wake up.
Make love to me.
All right.
You go on top, though,
'cause I'm knackered.
Listen.
Yes! Yes!
Yeah. SARAH: Yes!
Oh, yes! Yeah!
Yeah! Oh, God!
Yeah!
Right there!
Yes!
Yes! She's having Yes!
an orgasm!
This is the best sex ever!
Yeah, all right,
that'll do.
What?
I made a mistake
coming here with you.
And I'm not done either!
Please shut up! Okay.
Okay!
You're still involved
with him next door,
ain't you?
Excuse me?
You should've seen yourself
at dinner, Sarah.
Then we come back here,
and you put on
that ghastly performance.
I mean, I've heard that
women do fake orgasms,
but I've never seen one.
It really deeply upset me.
You should have seen
yourself at dinner.
"Oh, I'm Aldous Snow.
Bullshit, bullshit,
bullshit, bullshit.
"No, no drinks
for me, thanks.
"Bullshit, bullshit,
bullshit."
That's a really
reductive impression.
If I wanted to
see you act badly,
I'd just watch your TV show,
which, obviously,
I can't now, because
it's been cancelled.
Oh, my God,
you're such a prick.
And you know what?
Let me tell you something
about these tattoos, okay?
That is Buddhist.
That is Nordic. That is Hindu.
That's just gibberish.
They are completely
conflicting ideologies.
And that does not make you
a citizen of the world.
It makes you full of shit.
Was that genuine
or did you fake that?
Right. I'm gonna
probably clear off now.
I'll have a little sleep
for a few hours,
then I'm gonna probably go
in the morning, okay?
I hate your music.
Yeah, well,
I fucked the housekeeper
the other day.
Are you sleeping?
Not anymore.
I know that I'm leaving
in a couple of days,
so I don't even know
what the hell this means,
but I really like
spending time
with you a lot.
I know. Me too.
Hey.
Good morning.
Where are you going?
The Korean Textile
Manufacturer's Luau.
Just kill me.
Fun.
Joy.
I want you to know
that I meant
what I said last night.
I know you did.
I did, too.
Can I see you
again tonight?
Yeah.
I get off at 7:00. Yay.
Bye.
Sir, morning mai tai.
You know what?
I actually will not
be having an alcoholic
beverage this morning.
WOMAN: Jump! Jump! Jump!
Don't make me do it.
Hey. Morning, mate.
How are you today?
Yeah, I'm good.
I'm good.
You okay?
Am I okay?
I'm better than okay,
my friend.
You seem sprightly.
I had a great time
last night.
Congratulations.
Well done. Well done.
Thank you.
What about you?
What's with the bag?
Right, yeah.
I'm off back
to England, mate.
Oh, you and Sarah
are going to England.
No, no, no.
I'm just going alone.
Did you guys Yeah.
have a fight or something?
Yeah, it was really...
How you served five years
under her, I don't know.
You deserve a medal
or a holiday or at least
a cuddle from somebody.
You were only here
for a week.
Well, I don't know.
For me,
that one week of it
was like going on holiday
with, I don't know,
I wouldn't say Hitler,
but certainly Goebbels.
It was like
a little holiday with Hitler.
Jesus.
Hey, listen, at least
it's clear now
for you two to reconnect.
No, no. No.
You know what?
I have a good thing
going on with Rachel,
and I want to
see that through.
Well, maybe you could
have both of them.
Rachel and Sarah.
They got on all right,
didn't they, at dinner?
So maybe...
You know what?
First of all,
I'm not that kind of guy.
And even if I was,
I don't think that
I have the sexual competency
to really pull that off.
Yeah. It's a gift.
I will say,
if you do get back
with Miss Marshall,
handle with care,
because, you know...
Okay. Well, I think
my ride's here.
So I'm gonna skedaddle
then before anything
else happens to me.
Before life gets
any more daft.
Is someone
gonna take that?
Listen, don't let them
grind you down.
Take it easy.
Hey, look at my driver.
I'm gonna
have sex with her.
He said it was clear
I wasn't over you.
And then he left.
Fucking prick.
And then I started
thinking,
what if he's right?
What if
I'm not over you?
Sarah...
Please just let me
finish, Pete.
What if I made
a really, really
horrible mistake?
Sarah. Yeah?
Sarah. Yeah?
Stop pulling my face
towards your face.
Why?
You don't like it?
Listen, pulling my shirt
towards you
is the same concept
as pulling my face.
Let's spend one more
night here together,
and then let's
go home and then...
And we'll just pretend
like it never happened.
...face reality. No.
That's the big plan?
No. I love you.
That's not fair.
That's not fair of you
to say that to me.
Please, Peter.
Tell me you're sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I missed you.
I'm sorry.
God, I missed you, Peter.
All right.
Get hard for me, Pete.
Get hard for me.
I know what
I'm supposed to do.
Okay.
Just do it.
Come on. Get hard.
I'm trying. Okay.
Here. Just let me
do it for a second.
Okay.
I really
want you, Peter.
I missed you.
You don't want help?
You don't want help?
Can you be quiet
just for a minute?
Do you want my hands?
Maybe just don't
talk for a second
is what I mean.
Do you want
my mouth?
Yeah, maybe your mouth.
Yeah. Okay.
What's the problem, Peter?
I don't know... More?
You can keep trying
if you want.
What's wrong with you?
Nothing is wrong
with me, okay? Okay.
No, I didn't...
Just, something doesn't
feel right anymore.
Okay. Well, did you...
You know what?
Did you drink today?
Because sometimes
when you drink...
Excuse me.
No, I haven't had
anything to drink today.
Maybe the problem is that
you broke my heart
into a million pieces,
and so my cock doesn't
want to be around you
anymore, okay?
Ever!
Because you know
what I just realized? Huh?
You're the God damn
devil. Okay?
Wedding in Hawaii!
Real original!
Hey.
Hey, Rachel.
Sarah and Aldous
broke up this morning.
What a surprise.
So I went to check
on Sarah, and...
Listen, I'm here
because I don't want to
lie to you, okay?
Some stuff happened.
I'm really, really
sorry that it did,
but I'm also really glad
that it did, because
I'm able to see so
clearly now that Sarah and I
are not right for each other.
What stuff?
I went up to make sure
that she was okay,
and it got weird.
But now
everything is fine.
And I need you to
understand
that I meant everything
that I said to you
this morning.
What exactly
happened, Peter?
We fooled around
a little bit.
Shut the fuck up,
and tell me exactly
what you did.
All right. I went to her room,
and she was crying
and crying and crying.
And I felt like
I should comfort her.
And then she started
kissing me because
I was comforting her.
And then the next thing
I knew,
I was kissing her
because she had been
kissing me
because of the comforting.
Then she started taking
my clothes off, and
then her clothes were off.
Then she performed
of oral sex on me.
Okay. Peter,
you can leave now.
At the most. Maximum.
Thank you for staying
at Turtle Bay.
Rachel, please
don't do this.
The only reason
I'm telling you this
is because
I really care about...
Listen to me, Peter.
I was a mess, too.
I understand. Okay?
But it does not excuse
you acting like
a complete asshole.
Listen, I know that
I fucked things up
for a minute,
but I'm not like
every other asshole.
You should not be
with anybody right now.
Anybody.
I know...
I know that there is
something here.
I know that I was
not wrong about that.
And, yes, it's only been
four days, but I know
you feel it, too.
I need you to leave.
Do not write me.
Do not call me.
Do not e-mail me.
Peter, I need you to go.
I won't
bother you anymore.
I'm sorry.
I don't know what to do.
Hey, brother,
what you doing, huh?
You stealing my art?
I want you to
put it back right now.
Put it back, bro!
Listen, give me
the picture.
Doo-doo paper.
You're throwing
doo-doo paper?
Give me the picture.
Don't be stupid, brother.
Just give me the picture.
You can hit me as many times
as you want. I'm not
giving you the photo back.
Oh, yeah.
No, no, no.
Peter, I told you I
did not want to see you.
Aloha, I'm Sarah Marshall
from Crime Scene:
Scene of the Crime.
And when I'm not
scrubbing for evidence,
I'm flying Hawaiian Airlines
to my favorite destinations:
Now sit back
and enjoy your
in-flight entertainment:
I know I will: Mahalo.
PETER:
Everybody hates you
Everybody wishes
that you were dead
Because, Peter, you suck
Peter, you suck
Peter, your music
is fucking terrible
Peter, you suck
Peter, you suck
Peter, you don't
do anything of value
Peter, you suck
Write some music but instead
you sit and write
these bullshit songs
It's so self-loathing
Go see a psychiatrist
I hate the psychiatrist
Well, go see one anyway
I don't like the psychiatrist
You need to go and see one
See a psychiatrist
I'm not going
It's getting
kind of hard to believe things
are going to get better
I don't understand
what there is
to think about.
Because, D, he...
She licked the tip.
That doesn't count.
Of course
it counts. He...
He what?
He refused a blow job
from his ex-girlfriend
mid-blow job.
Do you know
what that's like
for a man?
It's called
blue balls, Rachel.
This guy is like Gandhi,
but better.
He likes puppets.
I love puppets.
I love Fraggle Rock.
I love Lamb Chop.
I love Elmo.
Sesame Street, Bert and Ernie,
Snuffelupagus.
Fucks my shit up.
This is a song that
I never thought I would write
On the night I'm dying
Sorry for all the wrong
I've done
I'm finished trying
It was a wonderful dream
Now let him come and slay me
There he is
The demon
who haunted
the streets of London
I've come to slay you
Here I am!
I'll leave you
bleeding in my dungeon
I'll never obey you
I'll rip out
your esophagus
Please,
Mr: Van Helsing
Listen to me
He is just a man
who wishes to be free
Lay him in a hearse
You must end this curse
He is the worst!
Don't go my love
I can't say goodbye
My reign is done
It's time to die
I'm pregnant
Dracula
What have I done?
Has flown above
Who killed Dracula?
But he found a taste
A taste for love
My life is a lie
Sweet Dracula
I miss
my young dead prince
I'll never see him again
Until my death
What a wonderful dream
To find a taste for love
A taste for love
Wow. You came.
I can't believe
that you came.
Peter, this is great.
It was really
funny. Yeah.
Thank you.
You know what?
I didn't realize
that it was a comedy,
and then someone told me that,
and it just, like,
opened the whole thing up.
How long
are you in town for?
Open-ended.
Bold. Yeah.
Yeah, you know,
I'm kind of checking
out some schools.
Congratulations.
Yeah, maybe.
You never called.
You told me not to.
And I listened.
Right.
Wasn't easy.
I might have called
once and hung up.
From a private number. No. No.
No.
Maybe.
MAN 1: Peter!
MAN 2: Nice job, Bretter.
Well, you should
probably go back.
Would you like to hang out
while you're here?
Maybe we could
go to dinner or...
Yeah.
Still have my number?
Yeah. Yeah, I'll call you.
Go.
Yeah, I should do that.
Yeah, yeah. Go mingle.
MAN 1: Hey, Peter!
MAN 2: Hey, Bretter!
Come over here
and meet my mom!
Go, go.
Off I go.
MAN 1: Hey, Peter.
MAN 2: Nice job, Bretter.
The play was
sick, man. Good work.
Nice job.
Good job, man.
That was awesome.
So cool!
Peter, congratulations.
I just wanted
to say thank you.
I had such
a great time
tonight.
Oh, good. You know what?
I'm gonna change
out of this unitard,
'cause I'm getting
a chafe. Okay.
Enough said.
Thank you. Congratulations.
Hey, Peter?
I was just calling you.
Wow.
Oh, Peter.
I'm sorry.
Stop laughing.
Can you please
stop laughing?
I missed you.
I just...
You know, I actually wanted
to tell you that I've been
thinking so much about...
