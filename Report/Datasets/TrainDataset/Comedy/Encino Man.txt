I hate those things.
Oh.

?? Ooo-ooo
ooo-ooo ??
?? Reality used to be
a friend of mine ??
?? Reality used to be
a friend of mine ??
?? May be why the question
that's on your mind ??
?? But reality used to be
a friend of mine ??
?? Reality used to be
a friend of mine ??
?? Reality used to be
a friend of mine ??
?? Please don't ask me
'cause i don't know why ??
?? But reality used to be
a friend of mine ??
?? I used to be friends
with reality ??
?? She used to be a pal
real close to me ??
?? But she tried to hide from me
what was in store ??
stanley, is that --
will you put that back ?
Ummm.
Put that back !
Hey, i just washed
all this stuff.
It's my gear.
Sorry, man.
It's okay.
What's my mom
screaming about ?
She's bummed 'cause i
snaked your last bagel.
Grab a shovel,
man.
No, i just
wanna munch.
You don't wanna help,
that's just fine.
uh-huh.
You know, this is
a total waste of time.
Dave, be more of a geek.
There's no way
you're going to the prom.
you're a disease.
Ahh.
And no one will ever swim
in this stupid pool.
Hey !
Later.
Look, david,
please do me a favor
and stress less, bro.
High school
is over, buddy.
Get into it.
We're losers.
I've decided something, stoney.
I wanna look back on
my high school career,
And think that i started
slowly but i finished
strong, you know ?
High school's almost over
and i don't have
anything to show for it.
I know, me neither.
You should be stoked
though, buddy,
'cause you got through
the last four years without
the full-on melon tweekage.
It's not enough.
I mean, i want my own
page in the yearbook.
Jump off the gym,
splatter on the street
and go for the co-ver.
It's not funny.
I'm not goin' down as
this geek kid from encino.
When i finish this pool,
i'm gonna have the
killer party after the prom.
I'm gonna be the prom king !
And i'm gonna graduate a legend.
well, what about me ?
Oh, well you'll
be there too.
Thanks, but robyn sweeney,
she's not goin' to
the prom with you, man.
-i wish she would but she's not.
-What are you talkin' about ?
Robyn sweeney
is mine.
She's become a major babe
and she loves me.
She finds you crusty,
dave.
I'll convince her.
She'll see
the truth.
Truth is...
Life's about greasin'
the do-back, buddy
and weasin' on the buffest.
High school was
interesting, right,
But it was kind of
like a harsh ride.
O-o-o-ow.
We're goin' on to bigger
and better things, buddy.
Stoney, i am on to
bigger and better things.
Count on it !
oh, wow !
Hey, what's up ?
?? I'm a stoney crusty dude
?? Did you know that ?
Get out, dude.
?? I got a mop
on top ??
Watch out !
Excuse me.  could you move.
Me and my friend, david
are comin' through.
Hey, there's robyn.
Hey, robyn.
O-o-o-ow !
Four-wheelin'
over the ferns.
Look, dave, you're gonna
have to mellow out, bro,
on this whole robyn thing.
She always shines ya.
You don't understand.
We have history.
You had pre-freshman
history.  you could've
had her back then.
She hadn't hit
"babehood" yet.
Milk does a body good.
Check her.
she's clean, buddy,
And he's got her.
Matt wilson ?
What a jerk.
What does she
see in him anyway ?
he's got the buff spikes
chillin' the top of his melon.
Dude, he's checkin'
her cheeks.  ooh !
He's got the serious beak,
his own personal... Oh !
Holding company,
Full of fundage, bro,
That he weases
off of ma--
jor.
eighteen inch bi's.
Bye-bye.
Mine are only four.
Besides that.
He walks like this,
right ?
Just like this,
the nugs fully loose.
Hi, matt.
Hi, matt.
All right, everybody.
Quiet, please.
Settle down, quiet.
We're gonna start
this week's class...
Same place we ended
last week's class.
That's talking about
prehistoric man
in the what ?
Prehistoric man
in the -- ?
Oh, stoney ?
Ice age.
Yes, ice age.
That's right,
the ice age.
Why do we call it the ice age ?
'cause there was a lot of ice.
What do we call
these big chunks of ice,
those big slabs of ice ?
We called what ?
What do we call them ?
Glaciers.
Right.  you are paying
attention.  that's good.
These glaciers, as they
moved down our way,
They're so heavy, cold
and thick that they
freeze the ground water...
And they form
underground -- ?
Glaciers.
Right.  believe it or not,
some scientists believe
that there are actual...
Underground glacial movements
still in this part of the world.
You know what i think
that is, class ?
lame !
Exactly.
Bunco, bogus.
Listen,
please remember...
That most of this hemisphere,
including the ground
i'm walking on,
All of this was under ice
at some point, so i guess...
Finding something frozen,
dug up here or there,
Wouldn't be that uncommon
when you think about it.
So moving right along
on your journey of knowledge,
Let me show you
cro-magnon man.
woo !
He's dope.
I'd go out with him.
no, no.
I don't think so, ella.
Cro-magnon man, even though
he's not bad-lookin',
He's standin' upright and all,
he was extremely brutal.
He just took
whatever he wanted...
And that included
his women.
That's barbaric !
Indeed.
????
Stone !
Stoney !
????
Hey !  come on,
check this out.
That's my lobes.
Feel the ground,
man.
Whoa, buddy,
it's chillin'.
It's not like
chillin', chillin'.
Bro, it is chillin' !
I know.
It's cold !
It's so, uh --
help me.
Check it, buddy.
Oh, buddy !
Dude, i know
what this is, bro.
What is it ?
It's a
mousterian bowl.
No way !
Hey, come on, david.
Be careful with that.
What's a mousterian bowl ?
A mousterian bowl
from the mousterian era.
"prehistoric artifacts
for five hundred, alex."
Don't you ever
watch "jeopardy" ?
Buddy, this is kind of like
prehistoric tupperware, bro.
It's still preserved...
Like smuckers !
Oooow !
Earthquake !
earthquake !
Earthquake !
Ahhhh !
Oh !
Oh god !
oh god !
Nice save, davage.
Stone ?
Yeah.

What ?
It's a caveman.
Would you please !
No, i'm serious.
No way !
Whoa.
A caveman !
This is unbelievable !
Do you know what
this could mean for us ?
This could mean --
this could mean fame
or money !
Or popularity !
Far too much
responsibility for me.
Anyways,
i'm already popular.
Yeah, you travel
in large groups
of one, stoney.
Besides, this is
my one chance to make
somethin' out of myself.
You gotta help me dig
him out.  you were here.
You're part of it.
I don't wanna be part
of anything, dave.
i'm happy just to be me.
It could mean money.
You tellin' me you
couldn't use a,
a new scooter ?
Some new bell-bottoms ?
A little fun-dage ?
Wease some older nugs
with a mansion and a pool ?
Soakin' up the rays,
Watchin' all the
"jeop-ardy" you can handle ?
That was the clincher.
Everybody's got a price.
Come on, man.
Steady it !
Give it more gas,
more gas !
Perfect !  hold !
This thing
weighs a ton.
Ahh !
Hey, there's his pits,
bro.

That's his skull.
Get off me !
What are you

I don't like mornings.
Ow !  come on,
let's get up.
He's still in here.
No kidding, dave.
He's an ice cube.
We gotta
thaw him out.
Okay.
This has gotta be
our secret, okay ?
You can't tell anybody...
Nobody !

Robyn wouldn't piss
on your gums if your
teeth were on fire.

Shush !  hush, please !

If we tell anyone,

They'll cut him up

They'll take all the credit,

Dad, linkavitch
chomofsky.
Our exchange student ?
He's here.
He's gonna help us
dig the pool.
- yeah !

Why does none of this
sound familiar to me ?
I told you about this
months ago, remember ?
About school giving us
extra credit for college
for housing exchange students,
And learning about
their culture and
you said it was okay.
Now you're gonna
take it back ?
No, no, no, i'm not
gonna take it back.
This is important to me.
this is my life.
It's embarrassing.
He travelled here
all the way from --
- i don't know, estonia ?
- yeah, estonia !
Mom, come on.
You're not buying this ?
Well, i --
dad ?
Actually, i, i,
i think now...
That i, i, i do
recall something.

- see, it's about focusing.
You're bogus.
Larry, how could i forget
something like this ?
He's an exchange student.
He's going to be staying
in our house.
You forgot me
in the third grade.
I spent the entire night after
the play in the parking lot.
In the sixth grade, the soccer ?
Okay, where's
he gonna stay ?
And why is he
attacking the dog ?
He's gonna stay in my room.
He's not attacking the dog.
He's bonding.
- as if !
- shut up !
- you shut up.
- no, everybody shut up.
Larry, it's okay.
I'm tired.
i'm a little hungry.
It's time we decide
what we're gonna make
for dinner.
I assume you'll
be joining us ?
You assume correctly, mr. M.
We practically feed the
entire neighborhood.  why not

I always eat here

Great.
Stop it !  no.
No, no, no.

Now he's gotta go

Who's that guy with
the dork squad ?
Oh my god,

Totally.
We have got a
major find here.
This guy's our ticket
to fame and popularity.
All we gotta do is get him
enrolled in school and he'll
help us become popular.
That's harsh.
We'll make him famous.
We'll teach him some
stupid pet tricks and
get him on letterman.
You're weasin' off
his gig.
Oh please !
He's a caveman,
for god sakes.
Look at him.
He's practically
a monkey.
We found him.
We can do whatever
we want with him.
We, we, we ?
No, no, no.
You, you, you.
I just wanna be
his friend.
Fine.
Hello, mrs. Mackey.

Gee, link, that

Is it old ?
You know, mr. M.,
the way i look at it,
some day...
Your daughter and i
could be married...
And we could
be related.
I count the days.
So, stanley,
how's your mother ?
She's really bummed.
Can you pass the peas ?
Sure.
Thanks.
Mr. Morgan, if you're edged
'cause i'm weasin' on your
grindage, just chill.
'cause if i had
the whole brady-bunch
thing happenin' at my pad,
I'd go grind over there.
So don't tax my gig so
hard core, cruster.
- stanley, speak english.
- dad !
Link, how was your day ?
How are you adjusting ?
He's doin' just great.
We got him enrolled
in all his classes.
Didn't we, pal ?
Yeah.
Ugh.
A success.
What's up ?
How was your day, mom ?
Where you goin' ?
- what's he doin' ?

?? Shoo, fly
don't bother me ??
?? Shoo, fly
don't bother me ??
?? Shoo, fly
don't bother me ??
?? 'cause you belong
to my friend, link ??
Good catch.
Meat group !
He's into munchin' too,

Blades... Finally
part of the elite.
How cool are we ?
We're cool.
David, i even showered.
Check out my --
I got some radical
deodorant on, buddy.
Take a whiff, bro.
?? Oh no
you're invited but
your friend can't come ??
Link, hey !
I am so glad
to see you.
Ugh.
Oh, hon, lose the geek squad.
They're bad for your deal.
Ugh ?
Blades !
Hummer patrol,
barneys incoming.
Robyn.
Get him.
Got him.
Hey, rob--
Robyn !
Good.
Good.
That was not cool
at all, you guys.
You could hurt his
pancreas or something.
I like the ketchup
and mustard.
Very avant-garde.
Whoa !
Is that me ?
Betty.
Betty.
betty ?
Betty, betty nugs.
Betty nugs.
Robyn, don't forget,
We've been
naked together.
Nice body.
Remember when
we were together ?
Did you show this
to anyone ?
No.
That's your copy.
Show anyone you want.
Thanks, dave.
Oh, i get it.
This is like your
old girlfriend in estonia ?
Do you miss her ?
Ugh.
Because i can tell you
from experience,
Long-distance relationships
never work out.
Ugh.
Estonia's a
long ways away, link.
Yeah.
And i'm right here...
So let's work on changing
your mind.
rad mobile.
Rad mobile
rad mobile.
Whoa !
Or not.
You just think i'm
bad for your act,
that's all.
Right, and you think
i'm good for yours.
What ?
Matt !
What are you doin' ?
You're not allowed in here.
Whoa-oa-oa !
Woo !
woo-woo-woo-woo !
Are you deaf, dork ?
Didn't i forbid you
to speak to her ?
I'm sorry.
That's all, link.
It's over.
End of story.
I'm sorry.
i'm sorry.
Huh ?
wease some juice !
Hey, you want
a piece of me ?
Oh god !
I don't know you.
I don't like you.
As of now,
i'm all over you.
Did you see that ?
the new kid,
he took it.
Whoa !
Whoa !
Don't just stand there.
Do something.
Stand up for yourself.
Hit him back !
Link, hit him back !
Where you goin' ?
What do you think of your
bulgarian dork bud, now ?
Hmm ?
That was harsh,
matt.
Let's get
out of here.
The stench of losers is
doing damage to my sinuses.
Just stop it, matt.
Don't even come near me.
Hey, watch it.
Why don't you take this,
'cause i don't think
i need it anymore.
Hey !
I can't believe
he got nailed.
He's a pacifist.
A pacifist caveman !
You're mental.
Cavemens aren't like us,
dave.
They fought for food and
survival.  they did not
fight for popularity.
What would he be
fighting for, huh ?
For face.
For us !
To be cool !
Cool, huh ?
He does not know
what cool is.
He doesn't know where he is.
he knows nothin'.
He's gotta learn
how to defend himself.
Against what ?
Against butt holes
like matt.
Come on.
come on.
?? I'm gonna knock you out
mama said knock you out ??
?? I'm gonna knock you out
mama said knock you out ??
our airplane's been
going round and round.

Hey, stop !

Ow !  hey, link !
Hey, look !
Hey, dude.
You took it from wilson.
No one's ever done that
before and survived.
Link,
come back here.
Stop !
Oh god.
He is so cool.
?? Matty told hatty ??
?? 'bout a thing she saw ??
?? It had two big horns
and a wooly jaw ??
?? Wooly bully ??

Hey.

Hello, little one.
We took a vote and
the computer club

Will be a valuable asset
to our organization.
Computer club.

Computer club.
Homeboy.
Why doesn't that happen
when matt hits me ?
Give yourself a
few million years, david.
Link.  link.
link, get down.
All right,
come on.
No, no.
I was just playin'.
all right,
cro-magnon man.
What you're looking at here
is a representation...
Of what cro-magnon man's
everyday life
may have been like.
If he was here today, you could
sit next to him, you would
never know the difference.
Stoney, let's move on.
We're gonna look at
the giant sloth.
Class, this is
saber-toothed cat.
Even though he's
been extinct for
over 10,000 years,
While he was alive
you can imagine that
many a caveman...
Was a tasty meal
to one of these.
There's one now.
Uh-oh.
Let's look at
the mammoth display,
our school mascot.
Look out !
Whoa.
Link !  link,
get out from there !
Look at him.
He's flipping out.
He knows, dave.
What ?
He knows.
He knows what
happened to him.
We have
to help him.
Link.
Link.  link.
Ow !
Link.
Hey.  hey,
come on, man.
Stop it.
Look, i understand.
Family.
Family.
Family.
You okay ?
It's okay.
We're your new family.
We're your
new family.
It's okay.
It's all right.
he's burnt
from all this.
Seeing as we started
the school year
as total losers,
And now everyone
knows who we are,
I don't think one mistake
is such a big deal.
But you're doggin' him.
Just promise me,
Just a little more mellow,
not so much ?
Stoney !
Dave !
All right.
If it'll make you
feel better, i'll be
more mellow with him.
Robyn sweeney ?
Here.
Again ?
I'm sorry.  i can't get
that parallel parking thing.
Whoa.  parallel parking
is not a thing, understand ?
It's not a feeling,
not a state of mind,
or one of your disco dances.
Yeah.
Get in the car and
don't take it personally.
Okay, mr. Beady.
- linkavitch chomofsky ?
- ugh, ugh.
What are you
lookin' at ?
Ugh.
Get inside the car...
And shoot
your barber.
Contrast this
with hemingway's
"the sun also rises,"
Where the blood sport
of bullfighting...
Is used and
perhaps what --
uh-oh.
Oh god.
Rad mobile !
Rad mobile !
Boys, will you sit down ?
Class ?
You promised me mellow.
This isn't mellow.
Link !  link !

Oh shit !
All right, link.

Red light !
Boom !

It's e684-257.
You don't have to write
that i left the keys
in the ignition, do you ?
Ow-o-o-o-o !
i think he's got
the hang of it.
That concludes our
parallel parking for today.
Class dismissed.

just failed driver's ed.

Great !

Nice element
you're hanging out with.
Who are your friends
in the low-rider ?
None of your business.
Go home.
Huh.
What time do you want me
to pick you up tomorrow night ?
It's the prom,
remember ?
You are just like
everyone else.
All you care about
is what people think.
It's really pathetic.
Hey, watch it.
Matt, i'm not going
to the prom with you.
I wanna go with somebody
who's really cool,
Who's not afraid of
being himself or having fun.
Good night.
Who's cooler than me ?
Your phone call.
You got one.
Make it quick.
Thanks.
Matthew wilson !
Hello.
Robyn ?
Robyn.
Dave, did you guys
get away okay ?
We're in prison.
Look, this is
my one phone call.
I'm using it to ask you
to go to the prom with me.
Just say yes,
okay ?
no.
Why not ?
I wanna go
with link.
What ?
Will you ask link
if he'll go with me ?
You want me to what ?
Look, i'm sorry.
I'll tell you what.
We'll all go.

How about that ?
Dave ?
Hey !
¿¿ c?Mo est? Usted ?

Did you meet anyone ?
Hey, wait !
Wait up.

It's best for me too,
all right ?
Here.
For rad mobile.
For rad mobile.
Yeah.
Put 'em
in your pocket.
Don't look at me

This is just the way
it's gotta be.
Go on,

Go on.
Go on, leave.
Go.
I'm sorry.
hey, hey, hey !
Talk to me, david.
Let me know what's
going on, man.
What are you doin' ?
I'm letting him go.
What ?
I can't handle him
anymore.
He'll be better off
with somebody else.
No, he's not !
Listen to me.
Call him back.
I can't take it anymore.
I'm not kiddin'.
Call him back.
It's time.
I'm serious.
Call him back.
That's harsh.
He's not
my responsibility.
You're the one who weased
off his gig the whole time...
'cause you thought maybe
he'd get you somewhere.
Now the guy gets a little crusty
and you're gonna bag him.
It's not happenin', dave.
That's not how it works
with friends, man.
You don't bag your friends
'cause they get in the way,
no matter what, dude.
Like you care ?  the only thing
you've cared about is nugs,
chillin' and grindage.
I happen to care
right now.
That's convenient.
You came along for
the ride and let me
do the dirty work...
'cause you thought it might
work to your advantage.
Those are desperate words
of a loser.
Maybe matt wilson was right
about you all along.
Take that back.
No, you take it back.
Take it back !
You're a loser.
-   family !
- all right.
I'm sorry.
Family.
You can let go,
link.
I'm sorry, man.
It's okay.
I don't know
what got into me.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it,
stoney.
I'm sorry, bud.
Ow !
You look great.
Have a good time.
You deserve it.
If you touch her ?
Ugh.
You think
they're ready ?
I don't know.
Dave ?
Dave, hey.
Hey.
You're not ready.
I, i can't go.
Of course you can.
Just go upstairs,
