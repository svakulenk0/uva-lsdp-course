Hey, Sailor, wait!
I got something for you.
Marietta tells me you were trying to
fuck her in the toilets.
- Oh, man ...
You crazy bad boy, trying to
fuck your girl's mama!
Tell me: how does
that little cunt Lula feel about that?
You know ...
Marietta gave me this
to kill you.
And then she said
I'd be able to fuck Lula ...
PEE DEE PENITENTIARY
Hello ...?
- Is Lula there?
Who is this?
Sailor Ripley.
Can I ... talk to Lula?
There's no way in hell!
If you even think
about seeing Lula, you're dead. - What?
You heard me.
And don't you ever call here again!
Mama?
You know who that was.
And you know you aren't,
and I mean are not
gonna see him ever.
End of story!
Like hell!
Lula!
Sailor!
- Peanut!
Hey baby!
I've got a surprise for you!
Hey, my snakeskin jacket!
Thanks, baby! Did I ever tell you
that this jacket is a symbol of my
belief in personal freedom?
About 50,000 times.
I got us a room at
the Cape Fear. And guess what?
"Powermad" is at the "Hurricane"!
Stab it and steer!
Jeez Lou-eez, Sailor,
you are something else ...
When I was 15,
my mama told me
that pretty soon
I'd be starting to think about sex,
and that I should tell her before
I did anything about it.
But I thought
you told me your uncle Pooch
raped you
when you was 13?
True.
Uncle Pooch wasn't really an uncle.
He was
a business partner of my daddy's.
Mama never knew 'bout me and him ...
that's for damn sure.
You know what?
You're a pumpkin.
Oh, my God! Get out!
Uncle Pooch died
in a car crash 3 months later,
on holiday in Myrtle Beach.
They still got
way too much traffic there.
Have you been
noticin' the buildup in traffic?
Here she goes again.
I'm sorry, Sailor,
but that ozone layer is disappearin'.
One of these mornings, the sun's gonna
burn a hole clean through the earth
like an electrical X-ray.
That won't happen, honey.
At least not in our lifetime.
And by then,
they'll be driving Buicks to the moon.
You OK, honey?
That woman's laugh
creeps me out.
Like something I've heard before.
Sounded like the Wicked Witch.
Just sounded like an old gal
having a good time to me.
You ready to go dancing?
I'm always ready to dance.
But I need my kiss first.
Just one!
I'm gonna hire me a hit man, if you
don't help me stop this thing.
I'm going to call Marcello Santos.
Marietta, I am gonna help you.
So don't get carried away.
You don't want
to bring Santos and his bunch into this.
You're just jealous of him
'cause he's still sweet on me.
You been seeing him again?
Oh my God,
I don't believe this!
Johnnie Farragut ...
who doesn't even trust
his very own Marietta?
Alright, I'm sorry honey, but ...
I just love you,
and it just brings out ...
That ugly jealous side,
I hate it, God!
No tongue! My lipstick.
Sweetheart, I want you
to stop worrying about me,
and start worryin' about
how to get Lula from that murderer.
Honey, wait a minute now:
Sailor ain't no murderer.
Now listen to me!
You gotta get off that kick.
As far as I know, Sailor was
all clean before he got involved in
in that event with Lula.
And even there,
he was trying to protect her.
That crazy Bob Ray Lemon was
comin' at them with a knife.
He could've killed both of them.
You oughtta be thankin' him!
I don't know why I'm telling you this.
You were there,
you saw the whole damned thing!
Didn't you?
Sailor boy!
How'd you like
to fuck Lula's mama?
No ... ma'am ...
I sure don't.
- Lula's mama would like to fuck you.
Mrs. Fortune, I really think
you need a cup of coffee.
Maybe I was there.
But I didn't see anything at all.
All I know is,
is that trash,
he killed a man
with his bare hands,
hands that are probably
all over my baby right now!
Oh, honey, settle down.
It's all right, come on now.
It's alright.
Now listen, I want
what's best for her too.
I'll do everything I can
to bring her back home, OK?
Baby, quit bouncing.
I got one more toe to do.
Let's go dancing, Peanut!
I'm ready.
But we better be careful.
Mama's gonna
have Johnnie Farragut after us.
He's one clever detective.
You know how clever?
How clever?
- He told me once,
he could find
an honest man in Washington.
I just want two more moments,
then my toes will be dry.
One thing puzzles me, sugar.
- What's that?
You're 20 years old.
Ain't you ever curious as to why
your mama wants to keep us apart ?
I'll tell you, Lula ...
it's more than
me killing Bob Ray Lemon.
Maybe my mama
cares for me just a little too much.
Yeah, maybe.
I just want
to kiss you goodbye.
You know too much about Lula's Mama.
What do you mean?
Johnnie told me
you were a driver for Marcello Santos.
So what?
- So maybe one night,
you got too close to a fire.
So maybe you're gonna burn.
Besides, you're shit.
You think I'd let my little girl
hang out with a piece
of s-h-i-t like you?
Kid, you belong
in one of these toilets!
You piece of white trash!
You ...
You're gonna have to kill me
to keep me away from Lula.
Don't worry about that.
First I'm gonna cut your balls off
and feed them to you.
You're gonna have to kill me.
I can arrange that.
It's a problem I don't think
is gonna go away too soon.
I'm ready to break parole
and take you out to sunny California!
Sailor!
- You up for that?
I'd go to the far end
of the world for you, baby.
You know that.
Rockin' good news!
Are those toenails about dry yet,
sweetheart?
We've got some dancing to do!
You gonna give me the
opportunity to prove my love to my girl?
Or you gonna save yourself
some trouble and apologize to her?
Don't fuck with me, man.
You look like a clown
in that stupid jacket.
This is a snakeskin jacket..
It's a symbol of my individuality
and my belief
in personal freedom.
Asshole!
Come here!
- Sailor, honey ...
I'm sorry to do this to you
here in front of a crowd and all...
But I want you to get up
and apologize to my girl.
I'm sorry.
You just bumped against
the wrong girl, that's all.
Get yourself a beer.
You fellas have
a lot of the same power "E" had.
Do you know this one?
Sail', how come you didn't
sing me "Love me tender"?
You told me
that was your favorite love song.
I told you I'd only sing
"Love me tender" to my wife.
Did you ever think something ...
you can hear a wind ...
and see the Wicked Witch of the East
come flyin' in?
I really did miss your mind
while I was out at Pee Dee.
The rest of your too, of course.
But the way your head works
is God's mystery.
What were you thinking?
Well, I was thinking
about smoking, actually.
My mama smokes Merits now.
She used to smoke Viceroys.
I started stealing
'em from her about 6th grade.
When did you start smoking, Sail'?
I started when I was about ...
four.
My mom was already
dead then from lung cancer.
What brand did she smoke?
- Marlboros, same as me.
I guess both my mom
and my daddy died
of smoke
or alcohol related illness.
Jeez, Sail', I'm sorry.
- Its OK, honey.
I hardly used to see them anyways.
I didn't have much
parental guidance.
The public defender
kept saying that.
He was a good ol' boy,
he stood by me.
I'd stand by you, Sail',
through anything.
Hell, Peanut ...
You stuck by me after
I planted Bob Ray Lemon.
A man can't ask for more than that.
You move me, Sail'.
You really do.
You mark me the deepest.
You're perfect for me too.
You remind me of my daddy.
Mama told me
he liked skinny women
with breasts
that stood up and said "Hello".
He had a long nose too,
just like yours.
Did I ever tell you
how my daddy died?
In a fire, as I recall.
Yeah ...
Mama told me he poured
kerosene all over himself,
and lit a match.
That was the year
before I met you.
No, I haven't found them yet.
Just try to take it easy.
- Johnnie!
I'm going to stay
right here, by this telephone,
until you find Lula.
And then I'm coming to get her.
So call me the second
you get to New Orleans.
I will, honey.
- Please don't let me down again!
I'll miss you.
- Get going! - OK. Bye.
Bye, honey.
Well, I guess you
broke parole now.
You guess?
My parole was broke 200 miles back,
when we burned Portagee County.
I guess I'll send Mama
a postcard from somewhere.
I don't want
her to worry more than necessary.
That's not why I
called you here, Santos.
That don't smell like a Kool.
It ain't.
It's part of the lessons of life.
Just tell me what you want.
You ain't gonna start worrying
about what's bad for you?
I mean, here you are, crossing
state lines with a real murderer ...
A manslaughterer, honey,
not murderer. Don't exaggerate.
OK, manslaughterer ...
who just broke parole and has only
immoral purposes in mind,
as far as you're concerned.
- Thank the Lord!
Well, you ain't
let me down yet.. Sail'.
That's more than
I can say for the rest of the world.
You please me too, Peanut
You want me to shoot
Sailor in the brains, with a gun.
Yes.
In the forehead?
- Yes.
Wrong!
It's always better to blow a hole
through the back of the head.
Right through ...
to the nose.
Lots of irreparable damage.
See?
I knew
you had it under control.
You are a little slow, but
you're beginning to get it.
Why didn't you send
Johnnie Farragut?
Maybe I did.
Why don't you
look in New Orleans?
Lula always talks about that town.
- On one condition:
You give me permission
to kill Johnnie Farragut.
Santos, please!
You're not telling me
you're that sweet on him?
What? No ...
- Are you that sweet on him?
No, but ...
- One day he's gonna find out
what we're up to with Mr. Reindeer,
and he can cause us a lot of trouble.
I'll take your silence as a "yes".
No, ... no, Santos ...
- Shhh, it's OK.
It's alright.
- No! You're not gonna kill him!
You're not gonna kill him!
- No, no ...
No, not Johnnie.
You kill Sailor!
I am going to kill Sailor.
You can be certain of that.
Hello, Mr. Reindeer.
Marcello Santos speaking.
Mr. Marcello Santos. Hey there!
That was great shit
you sent last in last month.
I've got a problem.
A couple of problems, in fact.
A couple of problems?
For each problem, drop a
silver dollar through my mail slot.
With all particulars.
We'll work out
"il conto" later.
Have a beautiful day!
We are.
Keep them panties up,
we're in Jimmy Swaggart country!
You know what?
That little bitch Susie
stole my comb.
I hate that.
The stupid little shit!
Phone's ringing.
Juana.
A couple of silver dollars
came my way today.
I'm sending one to you,
with a paper on the beneficiary.
As usual, you are completely free
to fulfill the obligation
in any manner you so desire.
In fact, send
Reggie and Drop Shadow over,
for the silver dollar
and the papers.
Now.
They're on their way.
Who's getting' the second silver dollar?
That's for me to know.
Yeah?
Thanks, Mr. Reindeer.
Have fun, darling.
How you doin', my boy?
Sometimes, when we're making love,
you just about take me
right over that rainbow.
You're so aware of what goes on in me,
I mean, you pay attention.
And I swear, baby,
you got the sweetest cock.
It's like it's talking to me
when you're inside.
You get right on me.
You are dangerously cute, baby,
I got to admit it.
Let's go out
into the crazy world of New Orleans!
Let's get a fried banana sandwich.
That's about the cutest
thing I've ever seen.
Pigeons spread diseases and
mess up the place. You've seen it.
The big N.O.!
Santos? I don't know ...
I'm having second thoughts.
Guess what?
There's no turnin' back,
remember?
I'm in a killing mood.
- Santos!
I saw your boyfriend on Bourbon Street.
- I'm not sure ...
What? Are you in New Orleans?
Crazy fucking bitch!
Ladies!
What are you?
You're not just a pretty face
with a fucking smile.
You're here
to make Mr. Reindeer happy.
And to show him a good time.
Do not bring misfortune
upon yourselves.
When I gave you
the silver dollar, I forgot
to include
the contents of this envelope.
They are to be returned.
Show it just before the deed.
I knew I had an important lesson
to learn that day.
When she got to the top step,
I stuck my hand between her legs.
Baby, what a bad boy you are!
Baby, what a bad boy you are!
That's just what she said.
I had a boner with a capital "O".
Anyway, I found her lying
in a room filled with
guns and porno magazines.
So, I slid
my hand between her legs again,
and she closed her thighs.
You're exciting me, honey.
Then what did she do?
Her face was
half pushed into the pillow,
and I remember, she looked back
over her shoulder at me and said:
"I won't suck you.
Don't ask me to suck you."
Poor baby, she doesn't know
what she missed.
What color hair did she have?
- Jet black,
but gentlemen prefer blondes.
Anyway, dig this:
She turns over,
peels off them orange pants,
spreads her legs
real wide
and says to me:
"Take a bite of peach."
Jesus, honey, you more than
sort of got what you come for.
Baby, you better run me
back to the hotel.
You've got me hotter
than Georgia asphalt.
Say no more,
but go easy on me, sweetheart,
tomorrow we got
a lot of driving to do.
Hotter than Georgia asphalt.
Wouldn't it be fabulous
if we someway stayed in love forever?
You think of the weirdest damn things
to say sometimes, Peanut.
Ain't we been
doing a pretty fair job thus far?
Oh, you know exactly
what I mean, sugar.
It'd make the future so simple and nice.
I've done a few things
in my life
which I ain't too proud of.
But from now on I ain't
gonna do nothin' for no good reason.
All I know for sure is
there's more than a few bad ideas
runnin' loose out there.
There's something
I ain't never told you about.
This here's a story with a lesson
about bad ideas.
What's that?
Well, my cousin Dell was
always fighting bad ideas.
See, Dell loved Christmas.
We used to call him
"Jingle Dell".
He wanted
Christmas to last all year long.
He sure would scream
when his mom told him it was summer,
and Christmas was
six months off.
Also, he said ...
he felt there's men
with black rubber gloves who were
following him around.
Dell said that trust in the spirit of
Christmas was destroyed
by ideas being controlled
by aliens wearing black gloves.
These aliens would get Dell
to do all kinds of things.
Then he'd carry on about the weather,
talk about how rainfall is
controlled by aliens on earth.
Aunt Rootie told him
that one day he would realize
that the alien wearing
the black gloves was him,
and him alone.
Sounds like old Dell
was more than just a bit confused.
Dell was learning a hard lesson.
It got so he would stay up
all night making sandwiches.
Dell, what are you doing?
I'm making my lunch!
Mama told me
Aunt Rootie, that's Dell's mama,
found cockroaches in Dell's underwear.
One time, she found Dell
putting one big cockroach
on his anus.
Hell, Peanut!
It ain't so funny now, though.
Dell disappeared.
Nobody's seen him since.
Too bad he couldn't visit
that old Wizard of Oz,
and get some good advice.
Too bad
we all can't, baby.
Are you there, Johnnie?
What's wrong, honey?
Johnnie, sweetheart.
Wait, I've got something to tell you.
I want you to know something.
I've done something so bad,
real bad.
What?
- Not on the phone! No ...
I'm coming to New Orleans tomorrow
to tell you in person. OK?
Don't do this to me. You'd freak out
if I did that to you. Now what is it?
No,
I'm not gonna tell you on the phone.
But honey, I gotta leave right now
and get on their trail.
The kids were here. They checked
out of the Hotel Brazil this morning.
No!
Stay right there! Don't go anywhere!
I'm coming in on Piedmont
tomorrow, on the 7 o'clock flight.
We're going after Lula together!
- OK, if that's what you want.
But I'm against it!
tomorrow evening. Sugar, ...
We'll have dinner at our
favorite French restaurant, OK?
You fix it up. OK, bye now?
I love you.
Marietta?
How much we got left, baby?
Under 100.
You want me to drive
so you can get a bit of rest?
- Yeah, that'd be good.
Come in, San Antonio, Texas.
What's on your mind this evening?
I just had triple bypass,
open-heart surgery,
and it's people like you who make me
wanna get out of the hospital ...
How can anyone listen to this crap?
... for her recent divorce, shot
her three children, aged seven ...
A judge
praised defendant John Roy,
but was dismayed to learn
that he'd had sex with the corpse.
What?
State authorities, last October
released 500 turtles ino the Ganges,
to try and reduce human pollution,
and will now use crocodiles to eat
corpses dumped by poor Hindus ...
Holy shit!
It's Night of the Living Dead!
What's that, Peanut?
- I can't take any more of this radio!
I've never heard
so much shit in all my life!
Sailor Ripley, you get me
some music now! I mean it!
... victim of a sexual assault ...
... mutilated ... raped ...
Johnnie, I can't tell you now,
honey, but listen:
Is there any way, any way
that we could get on the road tonight?
Something was upsetting you bad
last night when you called.
And you wanted to tell me.
So I figured that you
wanted me to help you.
I did.
Oh, I did.
But that was last night.
Now I need your help. We have to
find Lula before it's too late.
Honey, I have to ask you something.
- Okay.
Is Santos
involved in this in any way?
Hell no!
Do you think I would do something
like that without coming to you?
I'm sorry, honey.
Goddamned Pucinski, son of a bitch!
- Who, Uncle Pooch?
The son of a bitch who introduced
Santos to you and Clyde.
Johnnie ...
That's all the past.
Now what you and I have to do ...
is think about our future.
Do you mean that?
You bet your sweet ass I do!
Gosh.
Did I tell you
how great it was to see you again?
Just about five times, that's all.
Oh God, Johnnie, I love you!
- I love you too.
Let's get our backsides
out of this town and go get my Lula!
What's troublin' you, sugar?
You know, Lula ...
I never told you what all
I was doing before I met you.
I just figured
you were out being Mr. Cool.
Not exactly, sugar.
One reason we're in this trouble
is because of what I was doing.
I tried to tell you this before.
You're scaring me, baby.
Well, there's a good side
as well as a bad side to it.
The good side is that I knew
your daddy. Clyde was a good guy.
You knew my daddy?
- Yes.
I sure did.
The bad side of it ...
is I did some driving
for a man named Marcello Santos.
Oh Shit.
I quit working for him,
but just before I did,
I ended up one night at a house.
I didn't know it then,
but it was your house.
I don't know
what they think I saw that night.
I was just sitting out in the car,
'til the whole place went up in flames.
Oh God, Sailor,
that's the night my daddy died!
I know, sugar.
Daddy?
That's ...
some big secret
you've been carrying, Sail'.
We all got
a secret side, baby.
I hope you don't think
I been lyin' to you about other things.
Lula, you there?
Yeah, I'm here ...
You upset with me?
It just shocking sometimes ...
when things aren't
what you thought they were.
We're really
in the middle of it now, ain't we?
I'm gonna pack real fast,
then I'll meet you downstairs.
My God, what we could've done
on that kingsize bed tonight!
Don't worry, I'll make up for it!
- Alright.
See you in a minute.
- Okay.
Marietta ...
What's that?
I don't know ...
Looks like clothes.
Oh God, Sailor!
One bad car accident.
What should we do?
I don't know, but we got to
help that girl, get her to a town,
and hope nobody finds out
that I broke parole.
This bobby pin ...
I can't find it.
My mother's gonna kill me ...
... it's got all my cards ...
It was in my pocket.
Now my pocket's gone.
Gotta help me find it ...
All my cards ...
and it was in my pocket, and ...
My purse is gone!
Now she tells me!
Let's get a hold of her!
- Is she going to make it?
Don't know, but she's gonna
bleed all over our car!
Hey ... hello! Girl!
Come with us, honey!
Leave me alone!
Robert?
Robert!
Shit.
Got this damned
sticky stuff in my hair ...
... got sticky stuff in my hair.
Better come with us, honey. Come on!
Gotta find my wallet ...
Don't tell my mother, please.
God, she's gonna kill me!
Can't worry about that ...
Where's my hairbrush?
- God, she's dying right in front of us.
Get my lipstick ...
It's in my purse.
She died
right in front of us, Sailor ...
Why'd she have to go and do that?
Let's get outta here, honey.
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!
I don't understand this one tiny bit.
See, he told me to wait
for him here in that lobby there.
What I feel is that something
terrible has happened to him.
Perhaps we should
call a local law enforcement officer?
No, please! Please no!
The last thing I need
is some damned policeman
moving and going around here ...
No, I just can't ...
no ... no.
I am sorry ...
I must have overlooked this.
I'm truly
sorry, ma'am.
What?
Could you ...?
"Gone fishing with a friend ...
and maybe buffalo hunting, too."
Buffalo hunting?
"I've gone buffalo hunting."?
What the fuck
does "Buffalo hunting" mean?
Well, I am sure
I wouldn't know, I mean ...
My God ...
He's afraid.
He's done it again!
The fucker split!
"I've made a commitment."
Marietta!
Santos!
Gentlemen, I'd like
to take this opportunity to ask you:
Please, clear out!
- How rude!
Me too?
- Yeah, you too.
What did you do to Johnnie?
Where's Johnnie?
What's happening here?
Tell me what's happening here!
Santos, tell me!
You been crying?
You gotta cut out
this crybaby stuff, you know?
You're my girl now, and Santos ...
Santos ...
Santos wants to wipe away the tears,
and make you happy.
I want you to tell me ...
I want you to tell me ...
Did you do anything to Johnnie?
Did you hurt him? I want to know.
I did not do anything
to Johnnie Farragut.
You swear, on your mother?
I swear. On my mother.
- God! Oh God!
Come on. We have to go.
I got word:
The kids are moving through Texas.
And I think a happy end
is being arranged there.
That's it, give me a smile!
Oh Santos.
You're the only one
that always came through for me.
I smell your shit now, Johnnie.
Give us one more kiss, Reggie!
Oh, fuck me!
Fuck me!
Fuck me!
We hunt buffalo now.
Can't wait no more!
Remember the number ... ten!
I can't stop her, Johnnie.
But I gonna be standing behind you
with this big old gun!
It's a Marine issue!
I go out now ...
Reggie!
- Yes?
Show him now!
Honey ...
I forget to show you this!
Santos?
Oh God, Marietta, honey ...
One ...
Bye now!
- two ...
three ... four ...
Gettin' too hot now, Reggie!
five ...
... feeling myself ...
six ...
seven ...
eight ...
nine ...
Fuck me now, Reggie!
ten!
Why in the hell d'you want
to come to Big Tuna, Sail'?
I know
it's not exactly Emerald City ...
Not as bad as the weather, ...
'though it's a long way
off that road to California.
Why in the hell d'you want
to come here, baby?
Oh, look at this!
What do you want, Mr. Snakeskin?
I was hoping you could tell me
if there's a contract out on me.
I really need to know.
- By who?
Santos. Or Marietta Fortune.
I heard you were going
with that bitch's daughter.
You heard right.
- You are one big, stupid asshole.
Don't you know that her mami and
Santos killed her daddy?
So maybe one night
you got too close to a fire ...
So maybe you're gonna burn.
I didn't see nothin'.
- Sure. I did.
Santos!
Is there a contract?
We had a deal once:
We'd tip each other off if we heard.
I know. I remember.
Well?
I heard of nothing.
Thanks.
Sail', honey, is that you?
The one and only!
D'you get that oil, baby?
- Yes siree!
I met a guy called Red.
He owns a garage.
What's that smell?
I barfed.
I tried to make it to the bathroom,
but it was the wrong door.
I think all this driving
is upsetting me, baby.
D'you think we could stay here
and rest a couple of days?
Are you
carsick, sweetheart?
A little, I guess.
Oh Sailor, honey:
I hope seeing that girl die
didn't jinx us.
I got this for you.
It has 40 different flavors.
One for about every reason
I love you.
Sail', I'm gonna save this.
But if I ever eat it,
I'll be thinking of you.
"Robert Brenton
and two passengers, William Reese
and Julie Day, were killed
when his car crashed on Highway 118."
Robert Brenton, that dumb fuck!
That stupid shit was so dumb,
he deserved to die!
That asshole!
Timmy, what's going on in No. 4,
where them lights are always on?
Them are making
a pornographic movie, Texas style!
You wanna join in?
To survive in Big Tuna, you
need an active sense of humor!
This is Bosis Spool.
We call him "OO Spool".
The man is a rocket scientist!
My dog barks some.
Mentally, you picture my dog,
but, I have not told you
the type of dog which I have.
Perhaps
you might even picture Toto
from the "Wizard of Oz".
But I can tell you
my dog is always with me.
Hey everybody!
Bobby!
Hey, Sailor, Lula,
This is the man himself!
Bobby, this is Sailor and Lula,
the 2 most recent strandees,
of the economic variety.
Bobby Peru. Like the country.
Bobby just rolled into town
a few days ago.
Yeah, Bobby is
the most exciting item
to hit Big Tuna
since the '86 cyclone
sheared
the roof off the high school.
You from Texas, Mr. Peru?
I'm from all over.
You were in the Marines.
Four years.
Bobby was at Cao Ben.
- What's Cao Ben?
How old are you?
- Twenty.
A lot of women and kids
and old people died at Cao Ben.
You was on a ship, partner.
Pretty hard to make contact
with the people,
when you're out
floating in the Golf of Tonkin.
Come on Bobby,
have another glass of Jack.
Don't mind
if I fuckin' do.
Speakin' of Jack ...
One-eyed Jack's yearning to go
peeping in a seafood store ...
Alright.
Nice meetin' you.
Adios, boys!
- See ya, Bobby!
Bobby's got a way ...
Can't shake
that institution out of him.
Baby, I still ain't feelin' so well.
I'm goin' to bed.
Will you come with me?
- Yeah, I'll come along.
Well ...
Good night!
- Good night!
Lordy, what was that about?
I don't know ...
Man, that barf smell
don't fade fast.
Is there anything I can do for you?
I don't think so, Sail'.
I just need to lie down.
You know what?
I know you ain't
too pleased being here.
It's not that.
I'm gonna write it down,
because I can't say it.
You can't say it?
I can't say this, not out loud.
I'M PREGNANT.
Oh God!
It's okay by me, Peanut.
Well, nothing personal ...
But I ain't so sure
it's okay by me.
Really, Sail',
it's nothing against you, baby.
I love you.
I love you too.
I know.
I'm just sort of uncomfortable
about how things are going,
since we broke down
along that Yellow Brick Road,
and this doesn't soothe me.
Honey, I promise I ain't gonna let
things get no worse.
Not in a million years.
Hey, pretty woman. Is Sailor here?
No, he's changing oil out in our car.
- I gotta take a piss, bad,
can I use your head?
Oh ... yeah, I guess.
I don't mean your head head ...
I'm not goin' to piss on your hair,
just gonna piss in the toilet.
Ya'll take a listen, you'll hear
a deep sound comin' from Bobby Peru!
There's a smell in this room of puke.
Have you been puking?
Are you sick?
Pregnant?
- You used the toilet, now go!
It ain't none of your business
what I do around here!
I sure do like a woman
with nice tits like yours,
who talks tough and looks like
she can fuck like a bunny.
Can you fuck like that?
You like it like a bunny?
'Cause if you do, baby,
I'll fuck you good,
like a big old jack-rabbit,
jump all around that hole!
Bobby Peru don't come up for air!
Get out!
Am I scarin' you?
Is your pussy wet?
Is it wet?
Oh, don't jump back so slow.
I thought you was a bunny!
Bunnies jump fast.
You jump back slow.
Means something, don't it?
Means something to me.
Means you want Bobby Peru.
You want Bobby Peru
to fuck you hard, baby,
to open you
like a Christmas present!
You want me to do it?
Just a simple "yes" or "no".
Just feel me breathin' on ya.
And you know I mean business
when it comes to fuckin' ! - Out!
Bobby Peru will grab ya ...
hold ya tight ...
feel everythin' in ya.
Be quiet!
Say "Fuck me".
Then I'll leave.
- No way. Get out!
Say it! I'll tear your
fuckin' heart out, girl!
Say "Fuck me".
Say "Fuck me"!
Then I'll go. Say "Fuck me"!
Whisper it. Say it!
Say it. Say it!
Say "Fuck me".
Whisper it. "Fuck me".
"Fuck me". Say "Fuck me".
Some day honey, I will!
But I gotta get goin' !
Sing! Don't cry ...
Hi Bobby!
You need a hand?
- Thanks, but I'm about done.
How about a beer?
A beer ...
Well, ...
Yeah, Bobby, that'd be fine.
Where is your
pretty little lady today?
She's up in our room, restin'.
Hasn't been feelin' well lately.
Sorry to hear it.
I've been studying
a situation over in Lobo.
Take two men to handle it.
What's that?
A feed store,
keeps up to 5 K in their safe.
Need me a good boy
for backup. Even split.
Interested?
No, man.
I don't think so.
It'll be easy, Sailor.
Two employees. I take 'em in back
to open the safe. You cover the door.
You ain't plannin' on raisin'
a family in the Big Tuna, are you?
Wait a minute ...
Whad'ya mean by family?
Well, I mean ...
with Lula ...
being in a family way and all.
Did Lula tell you
she was pregnant?
Couple of grand or two
sure would help you two out.
Get you out West, to Mexico, or
anywhere with a few dollars to spare.
I've got it figured out good.
When did you talk to Lula?
I talked to her
this afternoon,
when you was out.
Did she really say
she was pregnant?
I just took a guess, that's all.
You in or out on this deal?
I ain't fucking sure, Bobby.
Don't take too long to think about it.
Had enough?
Have now!
Let's go outside.
I have something to show you.
Right here
is a double-barreled, sawed-off
Ithica shotgun.
Next to it:
a Smith & Wesson .38 handgun
with a 4-inch barrel.
Those'll do her,
really loosen up that 5 grand.
Two and a half
for you and the little lady.
How much money you got left?
Forty bucks ...
This is easy money, partner.
Ain't nobody gonna get hurt.
And I don't think
you can afford to pass it up ...
I'll bring the Eldorado to
the back of the motel at 10 AM.
Really could
set you and that little lady up good.
Yeah, I guess so.
That kinda money
will get us a long way down
that Yellow Brick Road.
But damn it, this better go real smooth,
you understand me?
Like taking candy from a baby.
Here comes Sailor.
You've been drinkin', huh?
A few beers is all.
Feelin' any better?
Can't tell yet.
That smell's still filling this room good.
So where d'you say you was?
I went with Bobby.
Sail'?
Let's leave here.
We are, Peanut.
Real soon.
You up to somethin' with Bobby Peru?
What could I be up to?
That Bobby Peru
is a black angel, Sail'.
You hook up
with him and you'll regret it ...
If you live to.
Thanks, darling.
I know
you got my interests in mind,
and I appreciate it sincerely.
I love you, but
I got to get some sleep now.
This whole world is wild at heart ...
and weird on top.
I wish you'd sing me
"Love me tender".
Oh, I wish
I was somewhere over that rainbow.
It's just shit!
Shit, shit, shit!
The whole gang, huh?
Yes.
You know, you look
a whole lot better in the flesh.
The cobra
is waitin' to strike, Chica.
You know that guy, Sailor?
He came by the other afternoon.
He wanted to know if there was
a contract on him. - No shit?
You know him?
- I used to.
What did you say?
- "No", of course.
That's right.
He could have
a bad accident, though.
Before,
during or after a hold-up.
What am I doing here?
Sailor, what are you doing here?
I can't do this.
Climb in back!
What the hell's she doin' here?
She's my girl.
She's drivin'. That bother you?
Jump in!
You owe me one.
Come on, Mr. Big Round Balls,
let's go
and make us some easy money.
They say the eagle flies on Friday.
Get that mask on!
Keep it revvin', Chiquita.
We'll be right back!
Nobody's gonna get hurt.
Remember that!
Right, partner!
Okay, boys!
Get in the back!
Get into the back! Now! Both of you!
If anyone comes in,
herd 'em back here quick.
Alright,
let's make this nice and easy!
You waitin' for somebody?
My husband.
He's in the feed store.
Well, watch that cigarette, ma'am.
It's about to burn down to your fingers.
Thank you, officer.
I haven't seen you before.
Are you from Lobo?
No.
Over here!
Big Tuna, huh?
That's quite a drive, isn't it?
- Yes.
Let's go!
Say "Cheese".
Stay put!
Cool it, man!
You're next, fucker!
Those are dummies, dummy!
Step up here, hotshot!
I'll slap
that smile right off your face!
Stop, you sons of bitches!
This is the police!
Hold it or I'll shoot!
Oh, for Christ's sakes!
That poor bastard.
Hands behind your head, cowboy!
Lula, I really let you
down this time.
Peanut!
Look for the damned thing!
We'll find it,
they sew them things back on.
Works good as new.
I can't find it.
Where is the damned thing?
It's gotta be here somewhere.
Pardon me. I'm lookin' for 770378.
Sailor, baby!
Oh my God! Oh my God!
My baby, sweetest one. Oh, sweetheart.
Mama's gonna take you home.
We're gonna go home.
Santos is gonna help us.
He's gonna take us
to the airport in San Antonio.
It's OK, baby.
- No ... - Yes.
Come!
We're gonna go.
It's OK.
- Mama! - Yes?
Sailor's in deep trouble here.
I can't just leave him.
Oh yes, you can!
Yes, you can!
Your mama was
real worried about you, honey.
Me too.
Can you
give your old friend Santos a hug?
Dearest Sailor,
First thing you'll want to know is:
I'm keeping the baby.
Mama wasn't for it at first,
but I think now she is.
I'm gonna name it Pace,
no matter if it's a boy or a girl.
It's kinda hard to believe that
Pace will be six when you get out.
Our child!
I love you, Sailor.
I miss dancing
and talking,
and especially the other!
When ... does ... Sailor's train get in?
Six.
If I asked you
not to go ...
It wouldn't make any difference.
Girl, what if I told you
not to go?
Mama, if you get in the way
of our happiness,
I'll fucking pull your
arms out by the roots!
No!
Mama,
you almost crashed us!
Oh, an accident, baby!
Oh no, oh man!
Same fuckin' thing
happened to me last year!
You must be my son.
Shake hands with your daddy, Pace.
It's a pleasure to meet you, Pace.
I read a lot about you.
Are you hungry?
Lead the way.
No!
No!
What's wrong, Mama?
Don't worry, son. Just stay here.
I'm sorry, Sailor,
I just can't help it.
Just give me one little minute,
then I'll quit.
The boy's frightened,
Lula. This ain't no good.
Really, Sailor, I'll be okay.
It's a mistake, honey.
You two go on.
I'll walk back to the depot.
What are you talking about?
That's your son in there!
He never knew me, Lula.
So there's not
much for him to forget.
And 6 years apart
makes it almost simple for us too.
How can you say that, Sailor?
It's what makes sense.
Please don't do this, Sailor!
If ever something
doesn't feel right to you,
remember
what Pancho said to the Cisco Kid:
"Let's win, before we're dancing
at the end of a rope, without music."
You've been fine without me.
No need to make life
tougher than it has to be.
Sailor, come back!
What do you faggots want?
The Good Witch ...
Lula loves you.
But I'm a robber
and a manslaughterer.
And I haven't had
any parental guidance.
She's forgiven you all that.
You love her.
Don't be afraid, Sailor.
But I'm wild at heart.
If you are truly wild at heart,
you'll fight for your dreams.
Don't turn away from love, Sailor.
Don't turn away from love.
Had enough, asshole?
Yes I have.
And I want to
apologize to you gentlemen
for referring to you as homosexuals.
I also want to thank you fellows.
You've taught me
a valuable lesson in life.
I just met
the Good Witch.
