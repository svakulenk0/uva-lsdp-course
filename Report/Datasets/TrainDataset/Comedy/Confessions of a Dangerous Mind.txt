I wouldn't want to live his life.
He hasn't been happy.
I think
if you can find work, stay healthy,
find somebody to share it,
you're the ultimate success.
He's had some of the pieces
of the puzzle but not all of them.
Chuck, it's Pen.
Jesus. How did you find me?
You wrote me your last letter
on hotel stationery.
Fuck.
It's great to see you, Pen.
You look... beautiful.
This place is scary.
Yeah. The human psyche.
I came to take you back
to California with me.
No.
It's a lonely state without you.
I am home, Red.
I can't wait forever.
Please marry me.
Well, apparently, I can.
But... I really don't want to.
Penny.
Listen, I gotta go.
I'm kind of busy right now.
OK?
What?
- Tuvia
- What?
Wanna lick it?
No. Why should I?
Well, it tastes like strawberry.
My sister tells me
you love strawberries.
Yeah, well, I hate strawberries.
Seriously. It tastes
like a strawberry lollipop.
- Look, I know that's not true.
- I bet you it does.
I bet you it doesn't.
I bet you a dollar.
We began making
commercial broadcasts in 1941
and in 1953, NBC made the first ever
colour telecast by network
during the
Now we'll see the studio
where they make the  show.
Excuse me, Miss. Do you know
where I can apply for NBC page?
which you
can tune into on Saturdays at 7:30.
which you won't wanna miss
on Tuesdays at 8pm
and hold on one second...
OK. And my personal favourite,
starring Rosemary Clooney.
Which you can enjoy
every Thursday at ten.
And
on Sundays at eight.
You may like to know
that Steve Allen
got his start in entertainment
as an NBC page.
Ladies and gentlemen, follow me...
You know Raymond in accounting?
He's kinda cute.
Cute is all well and good, Marianne,
but what you want
is a man who's going places.
A go-getter
on the management fast track.
Yeah, a management trainee
application, please, ma'am.
How many people
have applied for this?
Let's see.
Including you, about 2,000.
- For how many positions?
- Five.
Thanks, ma'am.
- Tell me again.
- Head of sales at 30.
Head of the entire network by 40.
I love you, Mr Chuck Barris.
Management trainee!
I got fired today.
Fired?
Yeah, fired.
Fired?
What the fuck did you get fired for?
I don't know.
Cutbacks, all that bullshit.
Look, it's gonna be fine.
I'm pregnant.
So, I figured, I'm gonna skip town.
I intend to be important, you know?
I can't be sad over this.
Then I remembered
something Carlyle said.
Do the duty which lies nearest thee.
- So you see...
- Who's Carlyle?
Dear God. Why do I?
Fuck you, you condescending prick.
Pregnant?
Yeah. Pregnant.
Fuck you.
Why the fuck
did you get pregnant?
Fuck you.
Why the fuck did I get pregnant?
You got me fucking pregnant,
you fuck.
Fuck you!
Fuck you. Fucking...
Fuck you.
Fuck!
Fuck you.
Looks like I was just late.
Yes. We had a great time.
The crew loved him and the show.
Because it was crazy and we could
do anything we wanted to, sort of,
and yeah.
They liked him very much.
He was a good guy.
Even though he's a prick,
he's a good guy too.
What a dream faculty.
Wouldn't school be wonderful
if we had a faculty like this?
Principal Sal Mineo,
Vice Principal Tony Perkins.
Imagine a school
where Sal Mineo was the principal.
Hi.
- What?
- Hi.
I wrote this song.
It's number three on the pop charts.
- See?
- Uh-huh.
Yeah.
There's a great future in television.
Uh-huh.
I'm gonna take my royalties
and I'm gonna create a pilot.
A pilot's
what they call a test TV show.
I work in TV.
Yeah. What's your name?
I'm Chuck.
- Debbie.
- Debbie. So you live in Philly?
No. I live in Manhattan.
It's going to be a game show.
I see a great future in game shows.
- That's good.
- Yeah.
Everyone loves game shows, right?
- I don't know.
- Well, they do.
Well, that's great then.
I'm on my way.
Hello.
Hi.
Don't be alarmed.
I'm here with Debbie.
Yeah. I figured that.
- Hungry?
- Er... no, thanks.
- Thirsty?
- Sure.
If you have a beer...
So how was sex with Debbie?
I always wanted to know.
It was good. Fine. Thanks for asking.
No problem.
I just got fucked by this drummer
cat. A real righteous negro hipster.
Ha. Interesting.
We did the brotherhood of man.
I fucked an Oriental last week.
- What are you?
- Jew.
I had one of those once.
He was Sephardic.
You look Ashkenazi.
- Ashkenazi?
- Right. Ashkenazi.
I haven't had one of those yet.
You're a romantic.
Yeah, I just don't get into all
the bullshit between cats and chicks.
- I know what you mean.
- You know?
Otherwise you give your heart
to one cat and get hurt.
Don't I know it.
We could ball if you want.
That would be good.
What kind of name is Debbie?
It doesn't seem right.
That's true. I didn't think of that.
I'm going to go to bed.
It was nice meeting you.
What's your name?
I'm Penny.
I'm Chuck.
- Chuck Barris?
- Yeah.
You wrote that Palisades song.
I like that song.
- Well, thanks.
- Yeah, real sentimental bullshit.
Right.
Last night in my dreams, this ape and
I are sitting staring at each other.
It was like across time
and evolution.
And then he started talking but in a
language I didn't really understand.
Swiss, maybe.
And then he turned into Perry Como.
Real square.
What's wrong with you?
Nothing.
Just because we fucked
doesn't mean there are strings.
I just wanted to tell you.
Nothing more complicated.
Don't panic.
I'm just not used to all this
dating bullshit, you know?
Now we're a couple, I'm obliged
to give a shit what you say.
Don't worry.
I'm not into those games.
So, anyway.
The monkey turns into Perry Como.
Holy fuck.
- What?
- Holy, holy fuck.
You just gave me an idea.
- For a show. Fuck!
- A show about monkeys?
No, about people.
About sex, about romance.
About the bullshit of dating.
I call it
And that's what it's about,
Mr Goldberg.
A pretty girl
asks three handsome guys
who she can't see
silly questions.
And based on her answers,
she picks one to date.
And we pay for the date.
That's it. That's the show.
Hot damn!
- What?
- They bought it!
They bought it! They bought it!
They gave me 7500 fuckin' dollars
to do the pilot!
Let's go roller skating!
I can't. I got a date!
- OK, cool. Will you call me after?
- OK.
OK. Bye.
- No.
- No.
- No.
- No.
No.
Alright. Lose it.
Whoa, I like this one.
Well, he led an amazingly long life.
What do they know?
That's long for a dog.
I don't know.
About 70 for you and me.
It's nine years to every one of ours.
Yeah.
I'm sorry about your show.
What?
How long has it been dead?
Jesus, Phoebe, that's...
Yeah. No, I'll hold on.
- Is that your mum?
- My sister.
Come here.
Here we go.
- I got you these.
- I'm not...
I wanna tell you something.
I talked to a psychic.
- A what?
- A psychic.
And she said you are gonna be
very successful.
Really. Yeah.
Very successful.
- Tarot cards?
- Tea leaves.
Say that again, Phoebe. I missed it.
Tuvia?
No, why would I have seen her?
She... She did?
Who's Tuvia?
To Manhattan?
Who's Tuvia?
Yeah.
Your niece.
Divorced? Really?
I didn't know she got married.
Yes?
Hi. Tuvia.
Well, if it isn't
Strawberry Dick Barris.
What do you want?
I'm back in town for a while
and I thought maybe...
Jesus, you've gotta be kidding.
He's so convincing when he talks.
He'll convince you of anything.
He's one of the very few guys
I'd like to have on my side
in a street fight.
You're a pretty angry young fella.
Can't fight worth a damn, though.
Screw off, queer.
I seen you watching me
in that bar for a week now.
Bit of a loner, I'd say.
Fairly bright, tad anti-social.
Mad at the world.
Can I buy you lunch?
There's a schoolyard up there.
Why don't you go trawling there?
I can teach you
at least 30 different ways
to kill a man
with a single blow, Mr Barris.
It might help in future bar fights.
Just a thought.
And there's money in it.
Good money.
You know,
I figure if I can keep afloat
until I come up
with the next game show idea
then... all will be copacetic.
That sounds great, Chuck.
I've never known a television
producer before. I'm impressed.
Yeah. What's the money deal
you were talking about?
I work for a governmnent agency.
Always looking for enthusiastic men
to help us carry out our directives.
What kind of work?
What government agency?
Problem-solving work.
The Office of Diplomatic Security.
So what?
I've never heard of it. Is that
the fucking CIA or something?
Please be discreet, Mr Barris.
Jesus.
It is the fucking CIA?
Yeah, I'll be a spy.
Where do I sign up?
You're fucking with me.
Hardly.
You wouldn't be
working for the company.
You'd be an independent
contract agent. Independent.
No official tie to any agency.
Understand?
Why me?
As you know, I've been watching you.
For quite some time, actually. I've
only let you know in the last week.
I'm happy to report
you fit our profile, Mr Barris.
Are you interested in the work?
Well, what's the profile?
Are you interested in the work,
Mr Barris?
Yeah, sure,
I wanna be a secret agent.
A contract agent, whatever.
Get to fuck Eastern European women.
What we do is very serious,
Mr Barris.
It's essential
in quelling the rise of Communism,
allowing democracy to get its
rightful foothold around the globe.
You understand?
Yeah. Sure.
Yeah.
Yeah. OK. That's good.
There are several efficient methods
for killing a man
were you to find yourself
without a weapon.
The edge of your hand against
your adversary's Adam's apple.
This will crush his windpipe,
causing strangulation.
And death.
Shit.
I need another volunteer.
- They're training me to be a killer.
- I knew you were bright.
Look, I'm not killing people.
My future's in television.
You're 32 years old
and you've achieved nothing.
Jesus was dead and alive again
by 33. You better get cracking.
I have ideas for shows.
Good. Why don't you spend
another six months developing them
while you stare out the window
waiting for Goldberg to call?
- What do you know about it?
- I know everything about you.
I know which hand
you jerk off with. Left.
Leave in the morning, if you want.
I'm here to tell you
this is honest work. Good pay.
You're making the world safer.
The country'll be grateful.
It'll toughen you up.
But wait a second.
We've gotta talk about this.
Glycerine is, of course,
the best known nitrating agent.
Keep in mind, though, that
nitroglycerine is extremely unstable.
A slight tap.
A one-degree change in temperature...
and it will blow up in your hands.
So let's mix us up a batch.
Everybody take
your 75 millilitre beaker.
And fill it up to the 13ml level
with red hot fuming nitric acid.
The field phone.
Used as an instrument
of interrogation. Or torture.
Attaching firmly to the genitalia.
Ivan.
Are you now or have you ever been
a member of the Communist party?
What's your aunt Tilly's recipe
for vodka cookies?
Alright, Jack.
Take care, Lee.
I know a lot about him you
are not gonna know. I can't tell you.
Yeah. I know some things about him
that are very distressing.
And you wouldn't wanna know them
about him.
So what did this guy
really do anyway?
Your job is to follow directives,
not question them.
-
-
- Eduardo, help me, please.
-
- No, no, no.
- Can I be of some assistance?
He's a bad guy.
He's one of the bad guys.
Bad for the US, right, Jim?
Not in the absolute sense,
just bad for the US.
Don't dance with me. He's bad
for the Tea and Biscuit Company.
He's bad for me personally.
You work for me. Renda's bad for me.
You can't back out now.
We've let you in on everything.
You don't play, you don't leave.
Understand?
You don't play, you don't leave.
You're gonna have a nice career
but grow up. There's a war on.
Yeah.
You did us proud today, Chuck.
Renda was a bad guy.
He really was.
- Chuck, is that you?
- Jesus Christ, Pen!
You scared the shit out of me.
- What are you doing here?
- I've been crashing here.
- Where have you been?
- Mexico, on a little vacation.
Did you drink the water?
Yeah.
That's Montessori's Revenge.
Montezuma's.
You can't open your eyes or mouth
when you take a shower there.
Why is our water so good
and theirs is poison?
- It's the same ocean.
- I don't know.
I'm a hippy now.
I've been to San Francisco.
It's amazing there.
Everybody loves everybody.
There are so many colours.
We're gonna change the world.
Will you come back there
and be my old man with me?
Well, not that old.
- Penny, I'm a little tired...
- Wait! I gotta play you this song!
Penny?
Penny, what did you do to my wall?
Some guy called. Goldbird.
Goldberg.
Larry Goldberg?
You're kidding me!
Hi, this is Chuck Barris
returning for Larry Goldberg.
- Hi, Chuck.
- Mr Goldberg.
I'm so sorry
I didn't get back to you right away.
I was on vacation in Mexico.
Good for you. Listen.
I'm just going through things
and I have a hole
in my daytime schedule.
It might be right for your baby.
My... My baby, Mr Goldberg?
Chuck,
Isn't that your baby?
- Yes, sir. It is.
- Are you still interested?
Yes. Very interested.
I've got six weeks to get it on.
Is that do-able for your people?
My people? Six weeks?
Sure. Yeah.
Give me a call
when you get to LA, Chuck.
Goddamn!
Hot dog!
Shit! Yes!
Who's Larry Goldberg?
Bachelor number one.
What would I like most about you?
I'm very romantic
and I'd send you flowers every day.
That's so sweet.
Bachelor number three,
what would I like most about you?
My big cock.
Bachelor number one.
What nationality are you?
My daddy is Welsh,
my mama's Hungarian,
so I guess that makes me Well-Hung.
Bachelor number... two.
I play the trombone.
If I blew you,
what would you sound like?
What would I sound like?
Alright...
Chuck, quite frankly,
these episodes are unairable.
Look, Larry. The show's spontaneous.
It's unscripted. That's its charm.
- I can't help what people say.
- Be that as it may, Mr Barris.
We can't have black men getting
blow jobs on national television.
It's not that he's black.
- I know that, Larry.
- Chuck, that's it.
We can't air this stuff. If you
can't retain spontaneity on the show
without lewd conduct,
it's finished, you're history.
Fix this fucking thing
or we've got a problem.
Hi, folks.
Before we begin taping today,
I'd like to introduce you
to Mr Peter Janks
from the Federal Communications
Commission. OK?
Thank you, Mr Barris.
I don't know if any of you...
are aware of this.
But it's a federal offence
to make lascivious remarks
on a television network broadcast.
The penalty...
...for this disgusting...
...un-American... behaviour
is one year in prison...
or a $10,000 fine.
Or both!
Anyone making a sick,
subversive remark tonight
will be arrested immediately.
I will personally escort
the offender to prison
for booking under edict number 364
of the Broadcasting Act of 1963.
And it's a long drive
to that prison, baby.
Just you and me.
No witnesses.
OK. Have fun, everybody.
Alright.
He gave everybody jackets
with their names on.
When we got number-one ratings,
everybody got a gold plaque.
He was a good boss
and obviously had the common touch
because he really knew
what people wanted to watch.
- A
- Hey, baby.
- I got a story to tell you.
- Asshole.
I know, I know.
I got a little story for you.
I'm busy. We're in the middle
of a bachelorette crisis.
Sit down, relax. Take a load off.
Make yourself at home.
- The network just called. Drink?
- Got any weed?
- I wish. No, no weed.
- Then I'll have a drink.
Bad news?
got pulled from Saturday night.
Not Tammy!
They want a primetime version
of  in its place.
That's fucking great.
But the daytime version's not hot
enough. They want more excitement.
I've got 48 hours.
What have you got?
I don't have a clue.
I've got nothing.
This is a big deal.
This could be my big break.
I know.
- Don't blow it.
- Thanks for the help.
- Let me ask you something, Chuck.
- Jesus.
What the... What are you doing here?
I've been put in charge
of a fairly large operation
and I could use your help.
I've got a TV show on the air.
I don't need to kill people for hire.
You may not need to,
but you'd like to.
- Bullshit.
- Think of it as a hobby.
Something you do to relax.
You can be an assassination
enthusiast. A murder bug.
I got more important things.
- I've no time to fuck around.
- This is serious work, Chuck.
Serious work.
Now how about
I help you with your little show
and you help me. Tit for tat.
That's the kind of guy I am.
Yeah. You're a piece of work.
I've seen this
I have a thought.
Now you're a big TV producer?
I'm John Q Public
when it comes to TV.
That should make my opinion
of value to you.
Alright, let's hear it.
Alright.
What do you have?
Some couple gets sent to
some second-rate shit-can
restaurant, set you back 50 bucks?
Not too exciting a prize for us
vicarious-living boobs in TV land.
- What's your point?
- Up the stakes, Chuck.
Send them to some exotic locale
in Europe.
Southeast Asia, for example.
The network won't let me send
unmarried kids on vacation.
Send a chaperone.
It's...
That's not half bad.
I'm telling you. Sometimes
you could be the chaperone.
Say we have a job for you in Austria.
You, successful television producer,
chaperones a young couple.
While there, you take on
some company business.
It's a perfect cover. TV producer
by day, CIA operative at night.
I got money, Jim. I don't have to
kill people for money any more.
Chuck, when I said
you fit the profile,
very little of that
meant you needed the money.
You liked it with Renda.
I saw it in your eyes.
You liked it but you botched it.
You could be a great warrior, Chuck.
This guy's never been on a date.
Ready four? Take four.
The only date this guy has had
is with his right hand.
Ready one? Take one.
Bachelor number three.
What if I pick you and?
- She's going for the three!
-
Ready four? Take four.
Bachelor number three.
Can you tell me what a girl is like
who has never been on a date before
and how you can tell?
Well...
I'll ask her what she likes to do.
And if she doesn't know
what she likes to do,
then I'll know
she hasn't done it yet.
Why don't you talk to her?
You can do that.
She's real shy.
You have to tell her.
That's your job.
Tell her
that I think she's real pretty
and I wanna be her boyfriend.
I'm shy, too.
You gotta tell her that, Chuck.
I used to skate. I told her that.
She didn't even look at me.
Talk to her, Chuck. It's your job.
She picked me.
She didn't pick those other guys.
You're the chaperone, Chuck.
She called me gay. I'm not gay.
You gotta tell her that.
You're not doing your job very well.
I know it takes time
to get to know each other
but this is ridiculous.
They thought he was...
They sort of walked a straight line.
They'd talk about him.
"This guy, he can turn on you."
And I never saw that side.
A lot of the crew thought
he could turn on them.
Chuck?
Excuse me. Is this seat taken?
By you.
Helsinki is wonderful
this time of year, isn't it?
Yes, it is.
I'm sorry.
Excuse me.
Helsinki is wonderful
this time of year, isn't it?
Especially the snow.
It affords one solitude,
even in a city full of people.
I'm Chuck.
So I gathered.
You are?
Here you are, Chuck.
At least give me a made-up name,
something for me to cry out
during those dark nights of the soul.
Cry out Olivia.
That's
Very good, Chuck.
Pleasantly surprised.
You're not like the other murderers.
You have it?
- Yeah, I have it.
- You have it?
Sorry.
- We're not gonna cheat you.
- Just the same.
Sorry about your teeth.
Chuck?
Chuck?
Olivia?
It's Patricia, actually.
So I spent a year in Operation Chaos,
inside the anti-war movement,
nudging it towards violence
to discredit it.
- That was fun.
- It sounds fun.
Tell me, Patricia.
Why did you come up here tonight?
I don't know.
You're kinda cute,
in a homely sort of way.
It's lonely
when the civilian you're fucking
calls out the name
on your fake passport.
All the information I have about
myself is from forged documents.
Nabokov.
Wait. I gotta go to the bathroom
and take care of something.
Leave the microfilm in, baby.
Do you know when
my episode's gonna air? OK.
Well, see you, Chuck. Bye.
This is Simon Oliver. Everything
go OK? You don't look too good.
Mr Barris. Do not ever
again jeopardise one of my missions
by having a game-show contestant
becoming a witness. Understood?
Do I make myself clear?
- Fuck you. They're my contestants.
- You are a bloody amateur.
- You're a faggot.
- Chuck...
Tell me, Mr Barris. Are you
in possession of my microfilm?
- I got it.
- Let me have it.
It's up my ass. Why don't you
reach up and get it?
What is this shit?
I just feel I deserve a little
appreciation for my efforts, Jim.
What do you think
Patricia Watson was?
Prick.
Well, if it isn't the hitman.
What?
The hitman.
- Surprise!
- What's going on?
ABC's picking up
daytime and primetime!
My God! That's sensational!
Fantastic!
We need a new ice box.
- Interpet.
- Inter-pret.
- Do you have an extra R?
- I can't give you a letter.
I should make you forfeit a turn.
- OK.
- You look cute today, Pen.
I always look cute.
Don't distract me.
- What was I gonna say?
- I don't know.
What were you gonna say?
I think we should get married.
Cos we've known each other forever.
And we've fucked each other forever.
And you think I'm cute,
you just said.
You always come to me
when you're in trouble
and I'm nothing like your mother.
What does that mean? What is that?
I'm just kidding.
Don't ask me to marry you again, OK?
Over here, Strawberry Dick.
- How do you know those things?
- We even know how it tasted to her.
Really? What did she think?
That's on a need to know basis,
my friend.
- What can I do for you?
- I really need something, Jim.
I need something for my head.
I got something for your head.
Name's Hans Colbert,
other side of the wall.
We don't like him very much.
You'll work with
a kraut named Keeler.
He's been tailing Colbert.
Knows the routine.
Keeler's a drunk,
so stay sober and take charge.
Done and done.
Kill for me, baby.
Sorry.
What are you writing?
Just keeping track of anything that
happens in the Clara-Zetkin-Straﬂe.
That's him.
Too many people.
Chuck.
- Chuck.
- Alright.
- Take the camera.
- Alright.
What is this?
What the?
- Take a picture.
- Take a what?
Take a picture.
Take a picture. Come on.
Take a picture.
He would disappear
for a week or so at a time.
His secretary would say, "He's
out of town. We don't know where."
I don't know whether
it's true or not. I couldn't say.
Are you still in one piece?
- Where the fuck you been?
- Nice flight?
Fuck you. Where you been?
I got one contact, Jim, and it's you.
If you disappear, I got no one.
- She's good, huh?
- She's very good, very good.
- That's great.
- That's fine. Thank you.
- Can't I sing the whole song?
- That was wonderful. Great.
That was enough. That was fine.
That was great. Thanks.
Alright. Next thing.
Christ. There has to be somebody
in America with talent... Hi.
Now, I saw her in a little club.
I swear you're gonna love her.
- Alright, thank you. Wonderful.
- That's great! Fantastic.
Great. We'll be in touch.
Thank you. Thank you.
We're going about this all wrong.
We're trying to find good acts.
We just put bad ones
and kill them.
Chuck, honestly, this is torture.
We kill 'em before they're through.
As soon as it gets unbearable,
we kill 'em. Dead.
Ladies and gentlemen, this guy...
This is so good. I love this man.
This next act
answers the age-old question.
If you wear a Cellophane...
If you... OK.
If you wear... a Cellophane suit,
can people clearly see you're nuts?
I don't know. A little humour, folks.
All the way from Pacoima,
Mick... Donnelly!
I should have known
there were so many Americans
We'll be back with more... stuff
right after this message.
You know what the sad part is?
Barris has a reputation
for lowering the bar of television
and the standards and all but...
He knew what people wanted.
And he couldn't take the criticism.
Hey! You're Chuck Barris.
- I love that show.
- Thanks.
Hi.
- Hi.
- I thought that was you.
Yeah.
It's me.
Well, I'm glad to meet you.
I've seen
You're the most despicable force
in entertainment today.
How dare you subject the world
to your loathsome views of humanity?
I don't think it's that...
What is it, then?
To mock some poor, lonely people
who are just craving
a little attention? To destroy them?
They're still people.
They still deserve
a little respect and compassion.
Who the hell are you?
What the fuck have you done
to elevate yourself
above the pathetic masses?
That's right. You created
Wow...
That's right up there
with the Sistine Chapel.
It wouldn't surprise me
to see this next act...
That means... it's Gene!
Gene... The Dancing Machine!
Line One's for you, Chuck.
Who is it?
A guy. He says
he's a friend of yours from Berlin.
Hello.
I guess you heard about Oliver.
Someone changed sides.
What was so urgent?
I was wondering. You wanna grab
a bite? I'm in town for a day.
- How's showbiz?
- Well, it's hit and miss.
I got a new show called
which I believe is really gonna kill.
It's sort of
a Bob Hope-visiting-the-troops thing.
Instead of Bob Hope,
it's Flip Wilson.
Chuck...
Why do you do what you do?
Well, I like to think
that I bring joy and laughter
to millions of people. That's very
important in these difficult times.
I'm not saying the show
is as good as it can be, yet.
No, no, no.
Why do we do what we do?
Hmm? Come on.
I got my feet wet in World War II.
Germany.
The pleasure of killing...
was exhilarating.
Later in life, I couldn't
find a place to fill that void.
To get that same rush of energy.
So I started up my own business.
Gentlemen. Are you ready to order?
A green salad. No dressing.
And for you, sir?
I'll get a steak. Rare.
Thank you.
Let me read you something.
Whatsoever your hand finds to do,
do it gladly,
because there is no work, love,
knowledge or wisdom in the grave.
Who was that? Carlyle?
No, it's the Old Testament.
It's God.
It's amazing you should quote him.
He's my hero.
Killing my first... man...
...was like making love
to my first woman.
I remember... every little detail.
It's like entering
a different time zone.
Ladies and gentlemen.
The host of
- Chuck Barris.
- It's good to see you, Sig.
Yeah. It'll be alright.
It'll be alright.
I think.
Was that right?
Yeah. It was real good.
It was real good.
So what's wrong, Chuck?
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, yeah. I'm OK.
It's just a guy I know
killed himself last night.
A guy I know killed himself.
Who was he?
You don't know him.
He's a... stage hand.
Why did he do it?
He didn't like his work any more.
Thanks.
Is being a stage hand
really, really bad?
Yeah, it's pretty bad.
Hello?
We were supposed to meet
at The Palm two hours ago.
- Fuck. I forgot.
- You forgot. Really?
- Keeler's dead.
- Yeah, I heard, I heard.
- What did you hear?
- I heard he took himself out.
- Did Byrd tell you that?
- Yeah, he said he was depressed.
- Hey! Alright!
- Who is this?
I don't get stood up. Get it?
Fine. Excuse me.
So glad... Penny, Patricia.
How did you find me?
Are you serious?
This is what I do for a living.
- What does she mean?
- You're dead, Strawberry Dick.
Strawberry Dick? What's that?
See you around. Nice to meet you,
Penny. I've heard a lot about you.
Why don't you stay for a... cocktail?
- Penny?
- And...
You know. Man...
I am giving you one more chance,
get it?
Thank you.
Thanks.
- Yeah?
-
You can come in now, Mr Flexner.
Chuck.
- Great to see ya.
- What's up, Rod?
Well... Chuck. May I sit?
How's that redhead?
Good. You know. Keeps...
Well, Chuck.
The thing is, we have to talk.
What's up, Ron?
Well, the thing is...
Some of your old shows aren't doing
so well in the old ratings war.
So,, I've been put
in the unfortunate position
of having to inform you that the
network is cancelling these shows.
Now don't shoot me, Chuck.
I'm just the messenger.
This really is
the hardest part of the job for me.
They killed my babies, Tino.
Just like that.
I pushed them into the world through
the birth canal of my imagination.
Lovingly. Tenderly.
Where's the humanity
of these people?
- Huh?
- Fuck 'em.
Fuck 'em.
They're fucking bastards anyway.
Yeah, what am I gonna do now?
Baby...
Yeah.
It's so good.
Chuck?
- Chuck?
- Fuck! Fuck!
Penny. Fuck.
I came here to tell you
I sold the painting.
That's great.
- What's she doing here?
- She's...
This is our house.
It's one thing to go elsewhere
for your pussy needs.
But... this is our house.
- It's my house, Pen.
- It's our house.
I found it with you,
I decorated it with you.
I spent six fucking months
waiting for the fucking plumber
to fucking come.
You're such an asshole.
No, I'm not saying that.
- That's not what I'm saying.
- Then what are you saying, Chuck?
Do you want me around or not?
Do you even like me?
Of course I like you. Penny...
- How much?
- What?
I need to know how much you like me.
I don't know what that means.
How much? How can I
rate a person in that way?
You could if you felt it.
If you felt it, it would be easy.
You would just...
...spread your arms
as wide as they would go
and say, "This much, Penny."
Everything...
Everything's complicated, Pen.
You know,
nothing's black and white like that.
Do you want me around or not?
Cos if you don't, it's OK.
Just tell me.
I love you, Penny.
In my way.
Maybe not in that crazy,
head-over-heels thing
but what is that anyway?
Romantic love?
Isn't that just an illusion?
You just said you loved me, right?
- Hiya, Chuck.
- Jim. What do you want?
How's work?
Any new gameshow ideas?
Dozens. Why are you here, Jim?
We need you to find the mole
and take him out.
Yeah.
I'm done killing people.
I just want to entertain people.
No.
It ain't that.
Yeah, I got an idea.
If you want him so bad,
why don't you do it?
Why don't you kill the mole?
You got a problem with killing, Jim?
I just don't fit the profile.
What profile?
There is no fucking profile.
- OK. There's no profile.
- There's no profile.
OK.
You had a twin sister, stillborn,
strangled by your umbilical cord.
Your first hit.
Your mother wanted a daughter.
She blamed you for her death
so until your sister Phoebe was
born, she raised you as a girl.
What else?
Your father, the dentist.
Not really your father.
Your real father was a man
named Edmond James Windsor.
Among other things, he was a serial
killer. Your mother didn't know
when she had an affair with him
in 1928.
- That's ridiculous.
- Is it?
That's insane.
Windsor died
in the electric chair in 1939.
I'm trying to think of
what more I can tell you
but you have me at a disadvantage.
I don't have your files with me.
I'm out, Jim.
I'm out.
As long as the mole's alive,
you're a dead man.
How do I know it's not you?
You're a fairly bright guy, Chuck.
Figure it out.
- Chuck. I...
- Take it off.
Who are you? What's your name?
What's your name?
That's the way it goes on... TV.
Get off the stage. Get off the stage.
Go back to Scotland.
Get yourself... a Guinness
and some Lucky Charms.
Alright.
Ladies and gentlemen.
Prince of Puns,
the Wizard of Whoopee!
The Unknown Comic!
Chuck-a-Daydee.
Chuck-a-Daydee! I got a joke for you.
What's the difference between
toilet paper and a shower curtain?
- I don't know.
- Here's the guy!
Get off the stage. Get off the stage.
- You're fucking crazy, man.
- Get the fuck outta here.
Ladies and gentlemen, our...
Our next act...
...first came...
...to us
all the way...
Lord, I'm going crazy
on coast to coast.
You like the way Mummy looks?
I bet you'd like to be a mummy
some day, wouldn't you?
Come on. Take me away now.
Take me away.
What are you waiting for?
Come on.
Come on. Come on.
Well...
Look who comes out of hiding.
I started thinking.
You're the only woman in the world
who really knows me. I know
I screwed you over in the past.
I'm sorry.
I just want you to know that...
...I hate myself.
Goddamn, I hate myself
for how I lived, Trish.
Nietzsche says,
"Whoever despises oneself
still respects oneself
as one who despises."
Shit, I never thought of that.
I can't even despise myself
with any insight.
Insane asylums are full of people
who think they're Jesus or Satan.
Very few have delusions
of being a guy down the block,
who works for
an insurance company.
Coffee.
Look at this.
I wanted to be a writer.
I wanted to write something
that someday some lesser person
would quote but I never did.
I'm the lesser person.
If I say anything meaningful,
it was said by someone else first.
I am disposable.
I disposed of people
and I'm disposable.
I've been thinking about you
a lot lately, Chuck.
Yeah?
- I've missed you.
- You could have fooled me.
Well, I've mellowed.
Look, Boston is a beautiful city.
We could start over here,
a normal life together.
Sell insurance.
Yeah, that sounds good.
That sounds right.
Look at that.
I could learn to love that skyline.
Did you see
I got your picture framed?
Yeah? Where?
Hot dog.
To life.
To life.
You devil. Isn't that sweet?
What about
splitting our time in New York?
Fuck. I just bit...
It's just a...
Too quick. You're supposed to get
to the bathroom and throw up first.
God, you should have seen
Oliver's face.
It was just... Well...
If I do say so myself. I got
a nice snapshot of it, actually.
Keeler was easy. He travelled halfway
round the world for a night with me.
OK.
Let's see.
Chuck, you've put on weight.
Come on.
Nearly blew it with Byrd. Never farm
out a job you should do yourself.
Do you want a laugh?
He thought you were the mole.
He was going to kill you.
What an idiot.
"I'm not at all the person
you and I took me for."
Hmm. Sounds like an epitaph.
Your handwriting, too.
You see, Chuck, I save everything.
All your lovely notes.
You know what?
I like Carlyle best, too.
I really do. Yeah.
Say hi to the boys when you see 'em.
To life.
Creator of
and many others.
Chuck Barris, who, most recently,
brought us such hits
as
Chuck Barris,
who I'm sure will be back soon
with even more shows
that will stimulate and educate
and keep us on the edge of our seats.
Hi, how are you?
Thanks. Thanks. Thanks.
Hit it. Drive, now!
- Bye...
- There's something I gotta confess.
Something I gotta tell you.
Listen.
You've known me a long time.
As the host of
OK. Yeah, yeah. Listen.
I worked... I worked for the CIA.
You understand? And I killed people.
I killed a lot...
I killed a lot of people.
You understand?
I killed a lot of people.
