Come on, Charlie. Stop messing
about. We have to get down to it.
I just hope our friendship survives.
George, don't be so melodramatic.
It's your autobiography, Charlie.
And as your editor...
...I have to tell you
that parts of the manuscript...
...are vague, at best.
For instance, your mother.
When did she first lose control?
We need to know those facts.
It's hard to say.
She could be so wonderful.
On her good days.
You are my honey, honeysuckle.
I'd like to sip the honey
from those red lips.
I love you dearly.
And I want you to love me.
You are...
You are...
Come on, love!
Get on with it!
Get off, you silly cow!
Come on, Mum!
We want a refund!
Come on!
Get off!
Off! Quick, Lady, off!
Come on. Cut it out!
Off!
You're out of it. Finished.
Ladies and gentlemen!
We crave your special attention!
Play the game!
Play the game! Come on, lads!
Please, sir!
Get off the bloody stage!
Isn't he cute?
I know it. I can do the song.
Let him do it!
Let him try!
Give the boy a chance!
What's your name?
- Charles.
Charles what?
- Charles Chaplin.
At very short notice
and great expense...
...for your special pleasure,
we present...
...Master Charles Chaplin.
Half a mo!
Ready?
You are my honey, honeysuckle.
I am your bee.
I'd like to sip...
...the honey sweet from those lips...
...you see.
I love you dearly, dearly.
And I want you to love me.
You are my honey.
Honeysuckle.
And I am your bee.
Your mother never sang again?
No. Never.
Mrs. Chaplin, if I don't get me rent,
I'll report you!
Them two little mites ain't fed proper!
If I don't get me rent, I'll report you!
You're two months behind!
The rent? Rent?
What on earth is that?
Shut up, you ghastly woman!
You tell her!
Sorry it's only fish heads again.
I'll get you plum cake one day.
When my ship comes in.
Mum? Someone's coming!
Mrs. Chaplin?
Are these your children?
Not the workhouse.
It's for their own good.
Stop! Come back here!
Come here!
Come here!
We've got him! Quick!
Syd!
Get off!
Put me down! Let me go!
You were beaten?
With a cane thick as a man's thumb.
And Syd?
Send to a training ship.
Then to sea.
You omit how long you were in
the workhouse, or how you got out.
That's a mistake. I was there a year.
My mother started
taking in piecework.
Sewing gloves.
While you were growing up,
there was just the two of you.
Your father?
- What about him?
He died during that period.
You don't write much about him.
I don't know much. He left,
sang on stage and died of drink.
What else should I say?
This is you're book we're discussing.
It's your life. It's up to you.
How do, old scout!
How do, old scout! What's up Rummy?
All the police gone?
Don't give me your lip.
All right, clear off! Now!
Didn't mean no harm.
Hey, Lil.
Charlie? Hello love.
Your mum's gone mad again!
Get off!
Thank God you got here, Charlie!
I got you that plum cake,
just like I said.
Thanks, Mum.
Make your mark, if you can't sign.
The doctor said to bring her here.
She'll be better off.
What about you?
- I'll be fine.
What do you mean, "fine"?
I'll stay with me aunt.
Watch your feet, mister!
Shoes cost money!
Sometimes she thinks
the floor is a river.
We won't get wet.
Yes, we'll do our best.
You should say good-bye now.
Wasn't thinking.
Mum, I love you so much.
I know, I know.
If you had given me a cup of tea,
I'd be fine.
They'll take better care of you.
One cup! You must have
wanted to get rid of me bad.
I didn't. I really didn't.
Come along, dear.
- You're a lying little runt.
You'll end up like your father.
Charlie? Don't do this to me.
I love you. Don't let them
take me away from you!
Don't let them do this to me!
Don't let them do this to me, Charlie!
Don't let them take me away
from you, Charlie!
Dressed in style
with your father's old green tie on.
I wouldn't give you tuppence
for your old watch chain.
Old iron, old iron.
Was you scared when you first
met this Karno geezer?
Everyone's scared.
And it's Mr. Karno, remember.
To be in vaudeville, you work
for him, or you work for nobody.
If you get this job,
and with what I'm bringing in...
...we can move Mom
somewhere better.
Don't let me down.
- I'll be great.
You don't have to be great.
Just shut up and be funny.
Hello, Mr. Karno.
Hello, Sydney. Come on over.
We've got something to eat.
Now then. What about
this young brother of yours?
He's been legit up to now, Mr. Karno.
But he sings and he dances a treat.
I've got song and dance men
like you coming out of my ears.
Well, his slapstick is fantastic.
He's got the knack.
Watch him.
He can do more, you know.
More stuff.
I hope so.
Bloody hell!
You okay?
Need the job that bad?
Yes, sir.
Comedy is knowing who you are
and where you come from.
It has to be perfection.
Can I come out now?
You may.
It's been a great evening so far,
hasn't it?
I promise, you're going to love
the next act.
Everybody loves elephants.
And here on our stage,
you will see twenty of the largest...
...most graceful specimens.
These are straight from the jungle.
Do you mind, sir?
I'm introducing
our dancing elephants.
Please do take your seat, sir.
Sit down, sir!
Take your feet down, sir!
Show a little respect!
Now ladies and gentlemen...
...a very big round of applause
for our next act!
Captain Boynton and his
Pulchritudinous Pachyderms!
Really, sir! This is too much.
Kindly remember, sir,
this is a place of entertainment...
...not a bar...
...or rest home for inebriates!
Now, sit down and behave yourself.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Charles Chaplin!
Good evening.
Hey, cookie.
Hello, dearie.
- Hello, Charlie.
I hear your governor's here tonight.
- I saw him.
Charlie, come and do me up, will you?
I'm so late!
I'll never make it.
When did it start?
This afternoon. He's four.
He was coughing his heart out.
It could be the croup. Call a doctor.
I can't afford a doctor!
Yankee Doodles,
five minutes, please!
Come on. Girls, move.
My Harry was in last night.
He thought you were hysterical!
How do I look?
Fine, fine.
You're a good boy, Charlie.
You saved me.
What are you doing in here?
The others don't mind.
Well, I do!
You must be new.
I'm going to complain.
I'll tell Mr. Karno.
Dirty good-for-nothing.
Lips.
Lips.
I'm still going to complain.
Well, thanks, I suppose.
Last again?
I'll get your coat.
Look the other way.
Hello, hello, who's out on the town?
Evening, Govenor.
And in my tails, at that!
Don't spill nothing down your front,
lad. That suit cost me good money.
Fred, you old devil.
You watch him now.
Tomorrow he'll be at sea.
Don't say I didn't warn you.
Good evening. I booked a table.
Name of Chaplin.
Mr. Charles Chaplin.
I booked it a week ago.
There's nothing here, sir.
We're fully booked.
There must be some error.
I really did book that table.
You know?
I know.
It's cause that geezer
saw us with Karno.
They won't have theatricals
in them fancy places.
You wait. Someday they'll beg.
We'll walk in, you and me.
You in a fur, dripping jewels,
me in my own whistle.
Whistle?
Whistle and flute. Suit.
Oh, I see.
Will you marry me?
No.
Where would I get the jewels?
From me. Engagement rings,
wedding tiaras, rubies...
Charlie, I can't marry you.
I don't see why not.
I'm only sixteen.
But you'll get over that. Why else?
We hardly know each other.
This is our first date.
When I return from America,
we'll spend more time together.
Are you serious?
Were you, Charlie?
You say you were.
I want to make sure.
It's on page forty-something.
Thirty-three.
I mean, you never even kissed her.
You think I don't know that?
I'll just backtrack for a moment.
After you had your mother
committed it all gets a bit vague.
Yes, it does.
Why?
Because I don't wish to remember.
Fair enough. But...
...if you'll allow me to say so...
...I don't think, and I know
this sounds very American
you shouldn't be afraid to let
the readers share your feelings.
Know what I mean?
You'll break me heart
if you say no.
At least say you'll wait for me.
I'll wait for you.
How long will you be in America?
I don't know exactly.
It depends if they like the drunk act.
If they throw things,
I won't be gone long.
They won't throw things.
They'll think you're wonderful.
I think you're wonderful.
The funny thing is...
...you never mentioned love.
I don't have to, do I?
The number nine's in from Chicago.
Let's load up the steers.
Nickel.
Sit down.
Have you seen that English bloke?
Watch this.
I've seen it before.
A telegram came for you.
Show it again.
You've seen everything twice.
The one with the fire engine.
You'll love this one.
If any of them could act,
they'd be on the stage.
Charlie, it's a telegram.
That can only mean somebody's died.
Some bloke's offered me
a job in California.
In the flickers!
The flickers aren't legit.
A hundred and fifty a week.
A hundred and fifty a week!
Watch your step.
Mack Sennett Studios
Hit him harder, Fred.
Harder.
Put some muscle into it.
This ain't a Sunday school picnic.
Ready when you are, Mr. Sennett.
Someone's in the shot.
Keep cranking. Still cranking!
Cut. Cut it! Jesus Christ!
Was it good till the dummies fell out?
How could I find Mr. Mack Sennett?
What the hell were you doing?
I'm afraid you just found him.
Hello, sir. I'm Charlie Chaplin.
You sent me a telegram.
Butte, Montana. You hired me
for a year, Mr. Sennett.
You're not Chaplin. Chaplin did
the best comedy drunk I ever saw.
I don't pay $ 100 a week to kids.
Another one, boss?
- No.
Mr. Sennett?
You might be Chaplin, after all.
And it was $ 150.
Plum in the middle of a shot.
You sure screwed it up, didn't you?
Fix it, will you, Rollie?
We don't print until we cut it.
That was negative, kid.
I know this is new to you,
this is not an ancient industry.
It's all built around speed.
Start the story, the chase.
I get bored easy is why.
How much of Mabel? A couple of yards?
Yeah. No, try three.
But we don't sacrifice quality.
I only make two pictures a week.
I'll spend up to $ 1,000 on each.
Well, Rollie?
Almost done.
Waste not, want not. That's my motto.
When Rollie's done, no one
will know you were there.
I'm rewinding.
You're on the cutting room floor.
Not the place to be.
Got it.
Forget everything you ever learned.
You're not in the theatre anymore.
That did it.
If you need me, I'll be with Mabel.
Nothing quite like it.
The feeling of film. But was it clear...
...how much the movies terrified me?
Not really. Why?
You must help me get that right.
I was right to be scared.
I was dreadful.
Sennett wished he'd never hired me.
I could barely keep control.
I would have been a total disaster
if I hadn't invented the tramp.
I wanted to talk to you
about that section.
The words just poured out.
It practically wrote itself.
I'd only been with Sennett a month.
That magical moment,
as I walked through...
...the wardrobe door.
I felt possessed.
I could feel him calling out to me.
The Tramp.
Bullshit. And you know it.
But the truth was so boring, George.
Jesus.
You told him to change.
- Into what, a suit of armour?
Chaplin! Get your ass
onto this stage, right now!
Forget the Limey. Get cranking.
Okay! Begin!
Very formal, everyone.
What the hell? He's crazy.
What do I do?
Cut it. No, wait. Hold it. Keep going.
Maybe he's not so crazy.
Photographer! Henry!
Chase him around the camera!
Okay, put him in line.
Big reaction! Who is this?
Stay down, Henry. Stay down!
Groom! Look jealous!
Jealous! Better than that!
Mabel give the tramp the eye.
That's right.
Matron, you're real hoity-toity.
Who is this bum? Good. Very good.
Groom, he's trying to steal your bride!
Matron, hit him!
All right! Domino fall! Domino fall!
Start the chase!
Don't stop! Keep going!
Good! Good! Terrific!
Look into the camera.
Snap it.
Watch the bride.
That's enough. Cut.
Chaplin, what are you trying
to do to me?
I knew I was right to hire him.
Listen.
You do what I say,
or I'll report you to Mack.
You stand up right now.
Pick up this hose and when I say,
sprinkle the road.
I could do more with that hose.
I could be funny.
Two months you think you know
everything. I'm the director.
This is not a movie about
being funny with a hose.
You're right. But it could be.
Chaplin!
He's coming.
I don't insist you fire him,
but if you do, that's fine.
I'd love to axe the Limey,
but I talked to new York.
It seems he's an asset to the company.
But I'll make sure he knows
you're a great director.
Is Mack ever waiting for you!
Come in.
Charlie, come in, please.
You got to help me with Mabel.
She actually thinks she can direct.
You're not mad, then?
I've been waiting for an actor
to have the guts to stand up to her.
I really like you, Charlie.
I really like you too, Mack.
And I'll bet you've talked to New York.
Let me direct the next one.
How do you know you can?
- I couldn't do worse.
Says you. What if no one wants it?
What if it stinks?
Who'll pay?
I've never seen you pick up a check.
I'll pay.
This is my work.
Did you pay?
No. But, boy, did I work.
I directed more than 20 films
by the year's end.
Why didn't you send for Hetty?
I did write. Never got a reply.
I thought she might be on tour.
So I asked Syd to track her down...
...see how she felt.
My god, look at him!
Dressed in style with your father's
old green tie on.
I wouldn't give you tuppence
for your old watch chain, old iron.
This is Minnie.
Nice to meet you.
Give us a hand, Chas, come on.
Why did you pick him?
- He's not so bad.
Our Syd's all right.
I don't know, Chas.
I don't see anybody staring at you.
Nice flivver. How long you had it?
- A couple of weeks.
When do I meet Mr. Sennett?
Got something to show you first.
Look!
New Chaplin Film
I don't believe it!
It's all happened so quick, Chas.
Last year, you were in vaudeville.
I'm top of the bill.
I still don't see anyone staring at you.
I don't look like me.
What news?
Mum? Oh, Mum is fine.
Well, not fine,
but there are lots of good days.
Well, not lots. But some.
And Hetty. Does she know?
The whole world knows about you.
She gave me this for you.
Fancy Hetty writing.
Look at this.
She got married.
I know.
I'm not surprised.
I wish her lots of happiness.
Well, not lots. But some.
Chin up, kid.
See, I was right. He is the
most famous man in the world.
Value for money is what we want, sir.
Charlie, take this guy back
to the asylum.
Syd's my manager. He left his
acting career to handle me.
Woe is me!
The theatre will never be the same.
What career? A thousand a week
is more than I get.
Charlie's name is bigger,
if you'll pardon me for saying so.
Charlie, I've been so rotten to you!
I don't know if you can forgive me.
I forced you to leave Butte, Montana.
I made you accept
a hundred and fifty per week.
I stuffed directing down
your throat, too.
Tell me how Uncle Mack can
make it up to you!
I want to run my own show.
I want control.
Dream on, kid. I know this business.
You're not that big.
First time I've seen you miss.
But, Charlie, Mack Sennett
was the king of comedy.
He gave you your start. How could
you walk out and leave him?
The reasons are clearly intellectual.
Money.
So you joined up with
Bronco Billy Anderson...
...a puffed-up cowboy star?
Not the high point of my career.
But I wanted my own studio.
I was putting money aside
to build one.
Excuse me.
Do you always eat alone?
Only when I'm trying to meet someone.
Actually, I'm waiting for my girlfriend.
I'm a motion picture director.
I'm forming a new company
with Bronco Billy over there.
And you need a new leading lady.
Lucky me.
You must be an actress, miss...
Purviance. Sorry. Just a secretary.
I'm auditioning actresses
who aren't actresses.
Well, if you need an untalented
actress who isn't an actress...
...you couldn't do better than me.
Worse than me.
Don't you want to know who I am?
I have no interest in who you are.
Mr. Chaplin.
Cut.
Not great.
We'll do another.
If I eat one more bean,
I'm going to be sick.
You almost had it. But this time...
...not quite so dainty. You're starving.
I know.
But it's hard to be hungry
after 46 takes.
But no one could do it as well.
We both know it.
I'll do my best.
How about dinner tonight?
Chili con carne.
I'll kill you, Charlie.
More beans.
Camera.
Action!
The arrival in the land of liberty.
That's all for today, folks.
Good to know I can count
on my nearest and dearest.
Don't come it with me.
"Arrival in the land of liberty"?
Showing the statue?
What are you playing at?
No one else seemed to mind.
Kicking an immigration officer
on the backside.
You think that's funny?
For those of us with a sense
of humour, very.
It was supposed to be a comedy.
You've turned it into a bloody
political tract.
We're guests here.
You can't criticize the way it's run.
Syd, I love this country.
I owe it everything.
That's why I can criticize it.
Why I must.
Remember where we're from.
There's a war going on, remember?
You make a million a year
while British boys die in France.
The London papers are after you.
You want that here, too?
I registered for the draft.
They never called me.
It isn't like I'm hard to find.
I'm on your side, kid.
First one on board, remember?
Be careful, Chas.
Just watch it.
That's all I'm saying.
You said you detested studio parties.
The worst. But not where
Doug Fairbanks was concerned.
Life was fun when Doug was around.
I don't think anyone today remembers
what a huge star he was.
I mean in those days, he was huge.
Men liked him.
Women adored him.
He was royalty.
Look out below!
Sire, you are most truly welcome.
Great party, Doug.
Isn't it fabulous?
- Wonderful.
I hate it more than you do.
I doubt it.
Of course everything changed
when America's Sweetheart came.
You mean Mary Pickford?
I always found her to be something
of an undersized bitch.
But Doug fell for her
like a ton of bricks.
Hello, Charlie.
Hi, Doug. Thanks for inviting me.
Mary. It's a pleasure.
Duty calls. Excuse me.
He's really a lovely person, Charlie.
Yes. Hungry?
Her name is Mildred Harris.
An actress?
Oh, yes. A child actress.
You ever hear the word "jailbait"?
That's the definition.
I'd watch it if I was you.
I value that, Mary.
Coming from you.
When America's Sweetheart gives
you advice, you'd better listen.
"Better listen?" Thanks, Charlie.
When here you're married and Doug
is married and you two are rutting...
...pretending you've just met.
Mr. Chaplin, please?
Lecture me more about morality.
Bettah, Bettah.
Bettah. Bitch.
Better.
I washed my face.
Come here.
What is it?
I just need some...
you just need some lip rouge.
I've some in my purse.
It's in the drawer, over there.
Look at me.
Is this right?
Just put it on.
You weren't yet 30 and were
the most famous man in the world.
You had your own studio, named
after you. Couldn't you just enjoy?
I can, now.
I couldn't then. It meant too much.
Mr. Chaplin, welcome.
Can I take your picture?
Cut!
- Hold it.
Let's try a little less.
Hold the smoke.
The dirt, I mean.
Someone get me out of this thing.
Looks great, Charlie. I kept the boys
here till you got out of costume.
You are an ass!
- Thank you.
One more, Charlie?
How's the light? I know.
It's better down at Barney's Bar.
Call it a day.
I don't feel funny anymore.
- Let's go, Charlie.
Are you cheating, Fairbanks?
You are a truly strange fellow,
Charles.
Nonsense.
Facts indicate otherwise.
Out.
These facts show a young man
of what, 29?
Not perhaps handsome,
but certainly not repellent.
Flatteringly put.
Double fault. Lucky me.
A fellow of fame and fortune,
not without talent.
Ready?
If only you'd put one in play.
Call this one out.
What for? I'm winning.
Damn.
Damn.
And who is he escorting?
Mildred Harris, that intellectual giant
of 16 who still sucks her thumb.
Very funny.
Then why aren't you laughing?
Because I'm marrying her.
She's really not that bad.
"Really not that bad"?
Spoken like a man desperately in love.
You're madder than I thought.
You sure it's yours?
I can only hope.
There are ways of getting out of this.
Where I come from,
that's not an option.
Besides, I want a family...
You'll have one before you know it.
May I congratulate you?
You may not!
Good!
You didn't suspect about Mildred?
Not for a moment.
Why don't you add that? Put that in?
I'll never forget the night
Mary told me.
We were celebrating
the end of WW1.
I met J. Edgar Hoover
for the first time.
You should explain this was before
he became head of the FBI.
If I may continue, Mr. Hearst.
We're too generous.
We're too open.
If we don't watch out...
...if we don't take steps now to impose
some new discipline, some decency...
...then we're in trouble. Deep trouble.
It's not fashionable to say this.
We're celebrating, we think it's over.
But democracy carries a price tag.
I think one of the most misguided
promises we ever made...
...was inscribed
on the Statue of Liberty.
One I predict will lead this country
into trouble.
"Give us your poor,
your huddled masses. "
We must stop this
before it goes too far.
Our concept of America
does not include...
...never included this kind of scum.
You must forgive
our famous young friend...
...his artistic temperament.
What you're saying is important.
We are giving sanctuary
to the refuse of the world.
Left-wing intellectuals
who want to bring us down.
Aren't you overstating?
No, I'm not.
Do you people realize
the responsibility you have?
To my way of thinking, movies...
...are the most influential form
of communication ever invented.
And they're not controlled.
Your message
reaches people everywhere.
Message?
Of course.
Mr. Chaplin reaches millions
who only have to see.
And when they see our immigration
service mocked...
...I call that a message.
As you've already said, Mr. Hoover...
...movies are for the people.
Most people work for a living
and don't make very much.
It pleases them to see officials and the
upper class kicked on the backside.
Always have and it always will.
And if that can change things,
so much the better.
Bettah.
He's improving.
But movies have made you rich.
They sure have.
I think you've handled it wonderfully.
Mildred.
The pregnancy?
Everyone knows you were conned.
Excuse us, Mr. Hearst.
I must be up early.
Come along, my dear.
You made an enemy there.
Was it personal, you think?
Personal? Maybe.
I'm sure he really believed
I was a communist.
I wasn't. I was simply a humanist.
He also believed you were a Jew.
Something I've rarely troubled
to deny, mainly because of Syd.
He's half-Jewish.
Same mother, different fathers.
I suppose the false pregnancy
was the end with Mildred.
You're so late again.
I'd almost given up.
Sometimes I feel I'm so close
to getting it right...
...but it slips away.
You've been editing that film
for months.
Will be for months, more than likely.
Not like the old days.
The good times.
The good times? Are they over?
You want me to leave?
No.
I'll leave.
Why aren't you bitter towards her?
Stealing my movie wasn't her idea.
Poor child was so stupid,
I doubt she could even spell "idea".
Wake up!
They're trying to seize the film.
Wash your face and wake up.
Sweet little bride of yours. Her divorce
lawyers say the film's an asset.
An asset?
I've got Rollie, the wife and 40
cans of film in the car. Come on.
Once we're out of the state,
we'll finish cutting the film.
You've got
your pants on back to front.
It's good.
It moves now.
I really do love that kid.
Where's that shot, Syd?
Look in 102, Rollie.
Wait. I've got it, Chas.
Minnie, answer the door. Hurry.
Here's your tea.
- Thanks very much.
He's on to us, boys.
You are the honeysuckle
and I am the bee.
They're here, boss.
I've dreamed of this moment for years.
This is America.
It's where your dreams come true.
Charlie bought you a lovely house.
It's not too big.
- Great ocean view.
You always wanted to live by the see.
Don't stop Syd. You're right. I have.
I think I will love watching the waves.
I'm sure I will. You boys!
You spoil me so!
More tea?
The mark on my arm?
I got that at the asylum.
If I'd fed you proper,
I'd never have gone there.
Now, if they ever come back for me,
I'll have enough food for us all.
I could never deal with my mother.
I just threw money at her.
You have to explain why you chose
that time to go to London.
I was tired. I had a movie opening.
I wanted to see old friends.
Straight into the water, ass over tip!
He needed the job that bad!
But I was worried, Charlie.
I was prepared for the worst.
I've seen it happen
in the profession so many times.
I'm sure you have, Mr. Karno.
Head size. That's the only true
measure of a man.
I sent this lad to America.
Look what's come back to me.
My head never swelled,
not with all my successes.
But I was worried about you, Charlie.
That night at the Troc, remember?
You took a tall suit from the
wardrobe and tried to be a gent.
Trying to impress that dancer,
Hetty-wasn't that her name?
Hetty Kelly.
I could see that you fancied her.
Sad.
I know all about it. She got married.
She sent me a lovely note.
I've got it with me somewhere.
Oh, Charlie, Charlie.
Don't you know?
Has nobody told you? She's gone!
The flu epidemic after the war
carried her away.
I thought someone
must have told you.
Must have written.
Didn't nobody?
What will we do, Charlie?
Smile.
Give me my hat.
Hey! That's Charlie Chaplin!
What can I get you?
Light ale, please.
That'll be tuppence, sir.
There's someone who had a good war!
He wasn't in the army!
Come to stare at the animals, Charlie?
Give your mouth a rest, Ted.
I just came in for a quiet drink.
Good to see you.
Have one on me.
You have one on me.
Mr. Charlie fucking Chaplin!
Cheers! Bloody bastard!
Don't worry about him. He's always
been a miserable old sod.
Good luck!
- I've seen all your pictures!
That's Charlie Chaplin!
There's the back way, sir.
You're very kind.
Charles Chaplin in the Kid.
Welcome home, Charlie.
I knew then that I had no home. So I
decided to put down roots in America.
A man came to see me the other day.
A corset salesman? I sent him.
Your paunch needs help.
He was the FBl, old darling.
Said he knew I was a loyal American.
He wondered if everyone else
felt the same.
I let him work his way around to you...
...which he did.
He asked if you were a member
of the Communist Party.
I said that was
an absolute impossibility.
Because I love America.
You were too cheap to pay the dues.
Remarkable. Your timing in work
is flawless. In life, it's the reverse.
You're a miserable pain in the ass.
But I'm worried about you.
Worry about your family jewels...
...old darling.
I'm serious. Watch out.
For what?
You're a foreigner.
You're still an outsider.
You don't understand this country.
It's a good country underneath.
No. It's a good country on top.
Underneath is what starts showing
when we're scared.
But you don't care about politics.
What is this?
Why are you worried?
Me? I haven't a care in the world.
I'm the oldest action star around
and talkies are coming.
What have I got
to be worried about?
That's talkies, Charles.
Talkies!
Talkies!
Imagine the tramp talking.
It's the future, Charlie.
Not in my lifetime.
Talkies!
It'll never catch on.
Talkies!
We've enlarged it for you.
I still can't make him out.
Have you got a positive I.D.?
It's Hawkins, sir. The red labour leader.
Visiting him in the studio.
How can we make them
realize the danger?
I told him that.
Face to face.
"You can damage this country".
He didn't get it.
How old is this one?
She's under age is all that matters.
We can go after him
for statuary rape.
The scandal will destroy him.
I appreciate your zeal.
But Chaplin and Miss Grey
were married yesterday.
If only he'd just sleep with them!
It would be so much easier.
Still...
...we must do what we can.
Lita was your second wife. She gave
you two sons, whom you adored.
This book is over 500 pages long.
Yet only five lines to her. Why?
I hated the bitch.
She was hardly more than a child.
It can't all have been her fault.
She was a profoundly flawed
human being.
We must deal with the problem.
You married her.
All your life you bedded babies.
Readers will want to understand.
Where were you when she had those
two boys less than a year apart?
You know were I was. Making a little
film called "The Gold Rush".
You're a flawed human being,
just like the rest of us.
Only, you have to address it.
I mean, why are we here talking
in Switzerland and not California?
It wasn't just the parlour pink
business or the speeches...
...or the donations that finally turned
you into an exile.
Nah.
You know what it was?
Sex.
Yes. Sex.
It's odd, but I've never looked
at a woman...
...without measuring that
possibility between us.
At the same time, I'm not that
interested-never during work.
I suppose it was only when I wasn't
working I was...
...vulnerable.
Why don't you write about that?
If you want to understand me...
...watch my movies.
Okay, sonny boy, tell your poor
little brother today's problem.
The same as yesterday.
And the day before
and the day before.
Fine. You be creative for a change.
The Tramp buys a flower from the girl.
For the plot to work,
she has to think he's rich. That's all.
Except, of course, the girl is blind.
And I don't know how to make her
mistake him for a millionaire.
Easy.
We'll do what everyone else is doing.
Joe!
We'll have the actors talk.
Joseph Curb, Vitaphone.
Hello, sir.
Sorry. You're in the middle
of a family feud.
You decide who's right.
The Tramp can't talk.
The minute he talks, he's dead.
Tell me I'm right.
He can't, because you're wrong.
Who'll pay to see you,
when everyone else uses sound?
I'll tell you who.
The Japanese and the Russkies...
Anyone who doesn't speak English.
Or did you forget about the other
Who's the most famous ballet dancer
in the world?
The most famous ballet dancer
in the world?
Nijinsky.
Fine. So let's say he was doing
"Swan Lake" today...
...and we went to see it.
He comes down to the footlights.
The orchestra stops.
He says, "Hi, I'm Vaslav Nijinsky".
No, he'd have Russian accent.
"Hi, folksies. Call me Vaslav Nijinsky.
Just call me Vas"
"It's okay by me".
"Everything is wonderful".
"Today I'm going to jump up
and down for you".
"Hope you like me. "
What would happen when he danced?
It would be awful.
Because the magic is gone.
As it would with the tramp.
Tell me I'm right.
I'm in the word business,
so I have to say you're wrong.
But I'm glad I got to meet you.
Enjoyed the dancing?
Yeah. And the talking.
Take Mr. Curb to his office.
Rollie! Get them all back.
Syd, we're in business!
How does a blind girl mistake
a tramp for a rich man?
When she hears a door slam
on the rich man's car.
She thinks the tramp's the owner.
Easy. When you know how.
Boys!
Boys!
I'm taking your ball to the cellar.
I don't see any stairs.
Mum's here. Off you go!
Your mummy's here.
I'll see you next weekend.
Come on, off you go!
It can't be all that bad, Mr. Chaplin.
Do I know you?
And why don't I?
I'm Paulette Levy.
Would you like a drink?
I already have one.
A fur coat?
You look hungry.
Actress?
If you watch B movies and don't blink.
But don't get any ideas.
- You're taken.
No, but I'm twenty-one.
Way too old for you.
You're very pretty, Miss Levy.
I didn't get here
thanks to my Shakespeare reviews.
May I say something?
You'd be prettier as a brunette.
You'd be devastating
if you were 6 inches taller.
Punch? Two, please.
At least you can do something
about your hair.
Never! I was born this way.
Nice to see you again, sir.
Evening, Mr. Chaplin.
Sorry,
I'm waiting for a natural blonde.
You look beautiful.
My usual table.
- Of course. Right this way.
You'd come a long way.
- Yes. My own suit.
No need to book a table.
I lived in luxury. But I was blind.
Blind?
Yes. That's fatal, for a storyteller.
Did I tell you I sold all my stocks
the year before the Crash?
That was clever.
It was deeply cruel, the Depression.
Can I have an autograph, Mr. Chaplin?
Yes, of course.
I wish they'd wanted my money.
You know what?
I've always had that gift.
After a man makes love to me,
he just goes wild from happiness.
I am happy.
Then I don't want to be around
when you're sad.
Terrible things have happened
since the Crash.
Millions of Americans
have been robbed of work.
Machinery is replacing manpower.
And I've said nothing.
Shame on me.
Shame on me.
You're right, Charlie.
It's three seconds too short.
Okay, we'll do a two-bar repeat
of the xylophone.
Sorry, darling.
I'm taking the boys out today.
Why don't you come?
Tomorrow, darling.
Definitely tomorrow.
Put that in straight away.
What should we do?
- Change the key.
Let me hear it.
No. I'll tell you why.
Charlie, you were supposed
to meet us at the fight.
I'm sorry. Who was fighting?
Mostly Mary and Doug.
You're wonderful, Miss Goddard.
That didn't work either, did it?
The Fairbanks are getting a divorce.
Mussolini has invaded Abyssinia.
You really need a break, Charlie.
We should take a trip.
Good idea.
What's a good idea?
Around the world, I thought.
I'm not going to make it.
Did you lose your other wives
this way?
I think so.
But you'd have to ask them.
Paulette. She was wonderful.
Her personality, you mean?
In bed?
- No. Well, that was good.
She didn't take me for a fortune.
Let me help you. Come on.
Okay?
I know you so well. I know you're
thinking of Doug, aren't you?
I was the only one who knew.
Don't say I don't look after you.
Mr. Chaplin. Always a pleasure.
How are you?
You look even prettier.
Nobody's fine and everyone needs
a drink. Champagne, scotch?
Scotch.
Is he, uh...?
Yes.
Seriously?
His heart.
- Shit.
Hey. Don't laugh.
I'm testing for Scarlett.
Why should I laugh?
Because it's a joke.
Everyone's testing for Scarlett.
I hear Katie Hepburn has it locked
away. So they say.
I haven't worked
since "Modern Times".
Neither have I.
No ideas. I'm desperate.
See you later.
I can manage a double.
Should you?
Are you two still married or what?
I find it very confusing.
When people thought we were having
an affair, we were married.
Now people know,
we're getting divorced.
You're a wizard with women,
no question about it.
Who's that man? Sounds German.
- Looks German.
Probably one of those directors.
Maybe he has a job for me.
Like Plato, Adolf Hitler is defining
the ideal state to be a model...
...for backward systems.
Do you know him?
I have that good fortune, yes.
And you have my word.
We only desire to defend our
historical frontiers. That's paramount.
Told you. Paramount.
It's not funny.
He merely wants to improve
the situation for the German people.
How can they let these fascist thugs...
To cut out the profit speculator.
The Jew.
Mr. Chaplin!
I am a great admirer of yours.
I'm sorry.
I don't shake hands with nazis.
What have you got against us?
What have you got
against everyone else?
You must forgive Mr. Chaplin.
He's a Jew.
So!
I'm afraid I don't have that honour.
Shame on you!
The former Miss Levy.
Shall we, my dear?
God bless you, Charlie.
I'll call you.
Yes. Please do.
A fine international incident
you caused!
Let's go out.
Not tonight, old darling.
I'm a bit tired.
It's funny, you look a lot like him.
Adolf, I mean.
With your moustache on.
I think he stole your act.
'Night, old boy.
'Night.
Sweet prince.
So much ended around then.
I'd been there 25 years.
Everyone else had gone over to sound.
I don't know
if I could resist it much longer.
Of course, U.A. was over for me.
United Artists.
You haven't written anything
about how that began.
I'll put something in.
It was a great idea, I think.
Creative people had their say
for the first time.
No milk.
A distributor said, "The Lunatics
have taken over the asylum".
That became quite a famous remark.
But U.A. did mean a lot to Doug.
When my mother died, it was sad.
But she was old, she'd had her run.
It was different with Doug.
Even today, I still miss him.
Tell me, when did you start
"The Great Dictator"?
'38.
And everyone thought you were crazy.
But when the war broke out,
you became a genius.
Not to those
who thought I was a communist.
Commen für der hair-dryen!
Und lager beer mit pizza parliament!
Big smile!
I know you. You bastard.
Syd? Is that you?
What's wrong? You wanted to make me
a talkie. Now I'm making a talkie.
Yeah, but not this.
I know this man.
I'm born the same year,
four days apart.
He's like me, capable of anything.
Nobody wants to see a film...
...about Adolf fucking Hitler!
I do!
You're missing the point.
It's not about Hitler,
it's about the Tramp.
The little Jewish barber
taking his place.
What's happening in Europe
is not our problem.
Ninety percent of the Americans
want to stay out of the war.
That's nine out of ten!
It's not your business.
You're a comic.
Yes, Syd. And you're a Jew.
Nevertheless, I've got to give it a try.
Otherwise, what have I been doing
all these years?
I know talking
will be the end of the Tramp.
But at least he'll say something
I believe in.
Okay. We'll see how it goes.
"The Great Dictator"
Scene y-11-a, take one.
I'm sorry, but I'm not an emperor.
I don't want to rule or conquer anyone.
I'd like to help everyone, if possible.
Jew, gentile, black man, white.
We all want to help one another.
People are like that.
We want to live by each other's
happiness, not misery.
Greed has poisoned men's souls
and barricaded the world with hate.
It's goose-stepped us
into misery and bloodshed.
Do not despair.
The hate of men will pass,
and dictators die.
He's not talking about Germany...
He's talking about America.
Turn that damn thing down!
This is what we need
to make people understand.
Mr. Seeley,
you're looking a little pale.
You need a trip to California.
Comrades!
Let us fight for a new world.
Commie bastard!
Soldiers! In the name of democracy,
let us unite!
What brings you here?
My firm is getting into movies.
But I really don't know
much about it.
Congratulations on the London opening.
Tea is on it's way, sir.
Lovely afternoon, Charlie.
Women drop handkerchiefs.
Men must drop other things.
"Upper regional domes
immensely expensive. "
That's how you describe Joan Barry.
She was very well-endowed,
is that what you mean?
You expect people to believe
it wasn't just sex?
Well, I didn't have to put a girl
under contract to sleep with her.
I spent thousands on her.
I wrote a screen-play for her.
I don't care what the readers think.
Joan definitely had talent.
She was intelligent. She was pretty.
She was willing to work hard.
And the screen test proved
that she was very photogenic.
But she became erratic.
For some reason she began
to have some kind of breakdown.
She took to driving to my house,
drunk, in the middle of the night.
She was arrested. Made a scene.
I refused to have anything further
to do with her.
How could you have been so foolish?
You took up with a crazy girl...
A promiscuous, vengeful liar.
And for the first time,
you didn't propose marriage.
Hoover had kept tabs on you
for 20 years.
And he still couldn't nail you until...
...you played it right into his hands
by shutting Joan out.
You're improving.
Can't you find someone else
to play with?
Apparently not. Not anymore.
Who's that?
The debutante.
You're doing a favour for her agent.
Not another one who wants to act.
It's endless.
This is the last time.
They think it's so easy. I bet as
a child, she wanted to be a fireman.
In half an hour, say I have an
appointment. Someone important.
Leave it to me.
Mr. Chaplin?
I'm Oona O'Neill.
If I'm interrupting your game,
I can always come back...
No. No.
I was waiting for you.
I always have tea at 4:00.
How long have you been here?
Just this summer.
My agent got me
a screen test at Fox.
Will they give you a contract?
I don't know.
Will you tell me?
Yes, if you want me to.
Charlie!
Excuse me.
It's nearly time for your appointment.
Appointment?
Who's it with?
Uh, Fred.
Fred.
Not Astaire again.
That's right.
And Ginger?
Could be.
I'm sick of them.
I'm not teaching them any more.
Let them make it on their own.
Right.
Sorry. I asked him to interrupt
in case I was...
I mean, in case you were...
I've never been to England.
All proceeds from tonight's world
premiere...
...will benefit families of American
soldiers serving overseas.
George, I've written this for the end.
For the last 20 years,
I have known happiness.
I wish I could write more about this.
But, it involves love.
Perfect love is the most beautiful
of all frustrations.
Because it is more
than one can express.
Excuse me, sir.
Sorry for the intrusion.
It's all right. Come in.
What is it?
I just took a call from Miss Barry, sir.
She wanted me to tell you
that she's pregnant.
Where's Charles?
With Harry.
He may be on the stage by now.
Is Charles down there?
She'll drop the paternity suit.
Her lawyers said she'll settle.
No. What? Just listen.
She'll take $ 150,000.
That's nothing, compared to a trial.
She says you did it at Christmas
when she came to your house.
I've never made you a deal
this good, kid.
It was over before Christmas.
It's not my child.
It'll be out of the way.
I can't do that. I've got Oona to think of.
I must prove my innocence.
I'm all for proving your innocence,
but how?
Go back to them.
I beg you.
Get them to agree to a blood test.
So that night you went to his house...
...did you and Mr. Chaplin
have sexual relations?
Doesn't it look like it?
Never mind what it looks like.
Did you?
She said she did.
Why else agree to a blood test?
The next morning,
he just called a cab.
Paid me off.
He wanted somebody younger.
Classier.
Didn't he?
Yes, thank you.
It's all over.
The test proved it's not my baby.
Let's just forget all this new-fangled
rubbish about blood-tests.
Put it out of our minds.
His honour has ruled them...
...inadmissible.
What matters now is the financial
future of this poor child.
It is her future
the State is here to protect.
It makes me mad...
...how this fellow tries to put it
over us simpletons.
This great star...
...of stage and screen...
...who has enjoyed our hospitality
for 30 years without...
...applying for American citizenship.
But what good has his money done
Chaplin?
Wasting his time debauching girls.
What good has it done America?
This is the kind of stuff
that makes for communism.
Now my client...
...on the other hand...
...is, alas...
...no more moral than Chaplin.
Ah, yes. Yes.
They're both equally guilty.
Only Chaplin is old enough
to be her father.
Prowling around with girls.
Members of the jury, use your common
sense, and just look at this man.
This cheap, Cockney cad.
This...
...little tramp.
Then take a very good look at...
...innocent Carol Ann.
I defy you not to see
the resemblance.
Gentlemen an ladies... wives and
mothers everywhere are watching you.
Watching to see you stop Chaplin
in his tracks.
You'll sleep well the night
you give this baby a name.
The night you show this lecher...
...the law means him
as well as the bums on skid row.
GUILTY!
Chaplin Baby Gets $75 a week

Chaplin Faces Call In Red Inquiry
Drive to Bar Reds Stirred
by Attack on Chaplin
Chaplin Joins
Red-Organized Peace Group
Not a Red, Chaplin Says
CHAPLIN FINISHES "LIMELIGHT"
It's a star-studded evening here.
Here is Charlie Chaplin
with his lovely wife, Oona.
Are you a communist, Mr. Chaplin?
Are you a fellow traveller?
Will you attend
the McCarthy hearings?
Gentlemen, please.
Mr. Chaplin has said he will go
whenever he is called.
Senator Joseph McCarthy
Even if there's one communist...
...in the state department...
...that would still be
one communist too many.
Mr. Lawson, are you now
or have you ever been...
...a member of the communist party?
I'm responding in the only way
in which any American...
...can respond to a question
which absolutely invades...
Then you refuse to answer, correct?
I have said I will offer my beliefs...
Stand away from the stand.
Stand away from the stand!
I am fighting for the Bill of Rights!
I'd love to get away for a while.
Maybe after this bundle arrives,
we could go.
Sir.
We just got word.
Chaplin left for London on vacation.
Where's Mr. Chaplin?
We left him at the stern.
It's all right, darling.
What is it, sweetheart?
Is it Syd?
What is it?
They've thrown you out.
Thrown me out?
Thrown me out of what?
Of America.
I'm so sorry.
I can't go back.
There are nights when it's still hard
being in exile.
They surely wouldn't refuse you a
visa now. Thought of going back?
Let's go in.
- I have everything I need here.
It's cold.
- I like the cold.
I must go away.
I must go anyway.
The telephone!
- I heard it ringing, thank you.
No, George, in answer to your
question. I'm used to invitations.
It's been a long day.
You must be very tired.
Come on, George, finish it off.
The question mark.
What is it?
You mean that?
It was a personal matter.
Nothing relevant.
Tell me.
Okay.
The madness.
I wondered,
how much did it affect you?
What makes you think it did?
Your mother was certified insane,
and...
...your grandmother was as well,
and, uh...
That's not what dogged me, George.
It wasn't that.
It was...
...the knowledge that if you did what
I did, if you were a clown.
And you had passion to tell
a particular story...
...something...
...beyond.
You only had one chance
to get it right.
And I never did.
One never does. But you know that.
That's not the problem.
It's when you feel you're
getting close...
...but you can't make it.
You're not good enough.
You're not complete enough.
And despite all your fantasies...
...you're second-rate.
It's human.
And it's very hard.
Why not add that?
It's not important, really.
Ultimately, you're judged by what
you did, not what you didn't do.
And I didn't change things, I just...
...he just...
...cheered people up.
Not bad, that.
Charlie?
Charlie, dear.
I dreamed I was answering
questions for George. Silly.
California called again.
You have to give them an answer.
They took 20 years to decide,
I can take another afternoon.
Enough. Enough!
From Los Angeles, the 44th annual
Academy Awards Presentation.
Suppose they start throwing things.
Now that would be a story.
You never know... on the stage.
I can see the headlines:
"Amazing incident at Academy Awards".
"Chaplin Disappears under
Avalanche of Oscars".
Look, it's Walter.
Does that make you happy?
No.
- Crabby.
I shouldn't have let them show
film clips.
People will think they're old.
They are old.
Well over 50 years, some of them.
You know the worst thing
about age is...
...you can't defend yourself.
When I was young and handsome
and had my power...
...I'd make a movie...
...and make them laugh
and make them cry.
Now I'm at their mercy.
Come in.
- Go away.
We're ready for you, Mr. Chaplin.
Behave yourself.
Now the President of the Academy,
Mr. Daniel Taradash.
Remember the President
of the Academy, Daniel Taradash.
Taradash? Sounds like a spice.
The inscription reads:
"To Charles Chaplin...
...for the incalculable effect
he had making motion picture...
...the art form of this century. "
"Humour heightens our sense
of survival...
...and preserves our sanity. "
The words of Charlie Chaplin.
The abiding elements of Chaplin's
artistic conscience...
...as actor, writer, director, and...
...to quote W. C. Fields,
"greatest ballet dancer who ever lived".
A few years ago, Mr. Chaplin said:
"My only enemy is time. "
We respectfully disagree.
I'm leaving you here, darling.
My white dress... They mustn't
see anyone until the clips are over.
Time is Charlie Chaplin's dearest
and eternal friend.
Here is the proof.
Watch... remember... rejoice.
The End
Charles Spencer Chaplin accepted
his Special Academy Award.
Days later, he left Hollywood
and returned to Switzerland.
In 1975 Charlie
became sir Charles Chaplin...
...receiving his knighthood
from Queen Elizabeth in London.
During a 54-years career, Charlie
made 81 films. Five were talkies...
...67 where completed
before his 30th birthday.
Charlie died, aged 88,
on Christmas Day 1977 at his home...
