For some brotherhood.
Then why did you send their names
to Hunt?
Because l thought the wrong code
could protect me.
But now l see.
Nobody can.
You're mess up in some weird shit, lady.

We have to go through out of the country.
Now my dear.
Would you mind taking off that wig.
Showing us Shosha.
We never told him she was the list.
Look at that.
to centres of tradition.
The only real proof
that the secret world exists.
Take their guns.
l told you he was bad, didn't l tell you?
While l was thinking it,
the explosion at the embassy.
As head of the world criminal court,
it would make sense for me
to be a target.
Why did you come to my room?
Geneviere was going to be killed.
Having you die in the crossfire
would put an end to the investigation.
Now, it will end another value.
lt's over, Reynard.
You know what it's like
to be an old man in prison?
They call you pops.
They make you work in the library.

Hundreds of years ago, the Triads will
kill their enemies...
with 100 cuts to the body.
They would be very careful to avoid
any major arteries...
so that the victim would stay alive
for as long as possible.
You have just experience
to your first cut.
