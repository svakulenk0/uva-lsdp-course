A-ha!
Eh?
"Booby Traps"?
Ah...
Oh, there you are,
my lovely.
Hmm! What's that?
Take the book?
I don't mind if I do.
At last, it is mine.
Finally, you are mine.
All right. Let's do this.
Bare knuckles.
Bring it on, skinny.
You don't scare me.
You got any sevens?
Go fish.
Is that all you got?
Ooh.
Hmm.
Man, this is way overdue.
"Once upon a time,
under the sea,
"there was a little town
called Bikini Bottom.
"In this town,
there was a place
"where folks would
come to eat a thing
"Every greasy spoon
has a fry cook,
"was named
SpongeBob SquarePants."
SEAGULLS: ¶ Who lives
in a pineapple under the sea?
Just hold it. Hold it.
¶ If nautical nonsense
be something you wish
¶ Then drop on the deck
and flop like a fish
Stop!
Huh?
There's only one thing worse
than talking birds,
and that would be...
Singing birds!
Okay, I promise not to
Take it from us.
He really does hate
singing birds.
Just keep weading.
Pwease, Mr. Piwate, sir.
Come closer
while I tell you the tale.
Okay, start reading.
No. Not that close!
Yeah. Hmm.
All right, here we go.
Now, SpongeBob
loved his job
He loved
his best friend, Patrick.
Whee!
He loved making
Krabby Patties
for the folks of
Bikini Bottom
just as much
as they loved eating them.
Why did they eat them
for breakfast...
despite their
doctor's warnings?
He'll be gone in a week.
Oh, Harold!
BURGER BEARD:
in these patties
that made them so delicious.
And, frankly,
no one cared,
Meh.
Plankton owned a restaurant
right across the street
because the food
was really bad.
Now, is that
really necessary?
BURGER BEARD: Plankton
had made it his life's work
SpongeBob, please,
let's talk about this!
And SpongeBob was
always there to protect it.
Good morning, SpongeBob!
Morning, Patrick!
You here for
your pre-lunch
Krabby Patty?
I'm getting two today.
One for me
and one for my friend.
Oh. Have I met this friend?
"You know me, SpongeBob."
Enjoy, Patrick's tummy.
Thirteen,
fourteen, fifteen...
Hey, Mr. Krabs,
I thought we got
our tartar sauce delivery
on Thursday.
Tartar...
Sauce?
PLANKTON: Bull's-eye!
Plankton!
So it's a food fight
he wants, eh?
Welcome to Air Plankton.
Please put your seat backs
and tray tables up
as we're now approaching
our final destination.
Okay, Patrick,
load the potatoes!
Mashed or scalloped, sir?
No, Patrick. Raw.
Sir, yes, sir!
Locked and loaded!
Don't worry, little formuler,
you'll be safe in this,
uh, safe.
Fire!
Potatoes?
He's closing in!
I think we have a few minutes
before he gets here.
He's right
on top of us!
Hey, it's raining fries!
It's gonna take
a lot more than potatoes
to bring this baby down.
Or maybe not.
Whoo!
Wait a minute,
Patrick, look!
He's got a tank!
Well, Krabs, you're certainly
in a pickle now!
Hey, it's raining pickles!
Now it's raining...
Tanks.
You're welcome!
Finland.
Your orders, sir!
I'll have two
Krabby Patties-extra ketchup,
extra mustard,
and hold the mayo.
Wrong channel!
Your orders, sir!
Extra ketchup! Extra mustard!
Hold the mayo!
Yes, sir!
Extra ketchup! Extra mustard!
Hold the mayo!
Unleash the condiments!
With relish.
Excuse me.
Hello?
Hello?
Money?
Thank you! Come again!
I can't hold the mayo
any longer!
Mayo? Well, it's going to
take a lot more than mayo
to stop...
Now what?
Oh!
I just remembered,
I don't work for Mr. Krabs!
SPONGEBOB: Robot! Robot!
Robot! Giant robot!
Robot! Robot!
Mr. Krabs, Plankton's here
and he's got a giant robot!
Quick, boy, bar the door!
Got it!
I'll take
one secret formula...
...to go.
Oh, barnacles.
I'm out of gas?
I'm not through yet.
I've got something
that will make you
hand over that formula.
Something you can't resist.
Money!
Yes! Huh?
That's... That's...
That's impossible!
Well, it was full of money
just last week.
And then
I bought that airplane
and built that tank.
KRABS: Sounds to me like
someone's just
a wee bit broke!
Well, Krabs,
I guess you've won.
I've spent every penny
I've ever made
trying to put you
out of business.
Except this one.
My last penny.
Besides, what can I do
with one measly cent anyway?
You could give it to me.
Just a suggestion.
Here, take it.
You've taken everything else.
Why not?
Well, Plankton,
like a reheated Krabby Patty,
you've been foiled again.
I guess this means
the secret formula
is safe forever,
right, Mr. Krabs?
It sure does, boy.
Why don't you scurry along?
Thanks for coming!
Have a nice day!
KRABS: He's been out there
crying for 20 minutes.
Pathetic.
I'm just going to
go out there
and gloat a little.
Cyclops to Laptop.
Come in, Laptop.
"Laptop." You do realize
that nickname is demeaning?
I have twice the processing
power of a laptop.
Never mind.
Maintain radio silence.
Finally!
Huh?
A pressure plate, eh, Krabs?
Amateur hour.
Hmm.
Perfect!
Not a bad likeness.
Good enough to fool
that idiot Krabs.
Easy, easy.
Plankton's broke!
Ooh-ooh.
SPONGEBOB:
Look at Mr. Krabs go.
I've never seen him
gloat this hard before.
Hey, well, Plankton,
me bunions are telling me
it's time to stop gloating.
Huh? Looks like you're
falling apart at the seams.
Huh?
Poor me.
Sob, sob.
A robot?
Plankton?
Uh-oh.
That ain't good.
FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE:
Me formuler!
Huh? Ow!
No, no, no! No!
Squidward! Open up!
Ha-ha, victory dance.
Boo-ya.
Give me that!
Come on, SpongeBob, join me!
And we'll be rich
and powerful,
until I eventually
betray you.
Uh, join me!
No! Never!
I'm on Team Krabs for life!
Plankton!
What? Where'd it go?
PLANKTON: Wait a minute.
Molecular deconstruction?
SPONGEBOB:
I think I forgot to empty
Gary's litter box today.
Where's me formuler,
Plankton?
I... I don't know!
It just disappeared!
Why should I believe you,
you lying liar?
Normally, I'd agree
with you, Mr. Krabs,
but this time he's telling
the truth. It just vanished!
It's true!
Mr. Krabs, I'm telling you
he's innocent!
What are you
going to do, Krabs?
Pour hot oil on me?
Or put bamboo shoots
under my nails?
No. Knock, knock.
Knock-knock jokes?
I can do this all day, Krabs.
Knock, knock.
Oh, boy. Who's there?
Jimmy.
Jimmy who?
Jimmy back my formuler,
Plankton!
Well, that's stupid,
but how is it torture?
You'll see.
"Jimmy back my formula"?
Hmm.
Oh!
I get it!
Oh, make it stop, Krabs!
Make it stop!
Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob, zip it!
Thank you, Squidward.
The customers
are getting restless!
They're asking for
refunds.
Refunds.
Refunds?
CUSTOMERS:
Refund! Refund!
Listen up, boy.
Get in there
and make me customers
some Krabby Patties!
All right, Plankton... Huh?
SpongeBob!
What's wrong, boy?
We're out of Krabby Patties?
How can we make
more Krabby Patties
without the secret formula?
You've got to have that
formuler memorized by now!
But as you are aware, sir,
the employee handbook
clearly states, and I quote,
"No employee may,
in part or in whole,
"commit the Krabby Patty
secret formula
"to any recorded written
or visual form,
"including memories, dreams,
and/or needlepoint."
Curse you,
fine print!
CUSTOMERS:
Refund! Refund! Refund!
Stop!
I'm not your enemy!
Plankton is your enemy!
So is he an anemone
or a plankton?
Well, someone had to do it.
But Mr. Krabs...
He took this from you!
Krabby Patty...
I can almost taste it.
Uh, Mr. Krabs,
Plankton didn't take
the secret formula.
Not now, SpongeBob!
Hey! I ordered
a double Krabby Patty!
So join me! Help get
the formuler back,
and I'll give each
and every one of you
a free Krabby Patty!
Oh, no! Wait!
Even better,
a slight discount!
To The Chum Bucket!
But he didn't do it.
PLANKTON: I had it right
in my greedy little mitts,
and then... Poof!
And now it's gone.
Gone forever.
Oh, I was so close to
gaining the people's
respect-slash-fear.
Oh, when will my
frustration-slash-humiliation
end?
Not now, hon!
I'm ranting-slash-raving.
All right, what is it?
Oh.
CROWD: Hmm?
We'd like to have
a word with you!
You all look very hungry.
Can I get anybody
a Chum Burger?
KRABS: Enough with
the niceties, Plankton!
This is the last time
I'm going to ask you.
Where is me formuler?
I told you, Krabs,
I don't have it.
Wrong answer.
SPONGEBOB: Stop!
All right, Mr. Krabs,
let me get in on this.
What's going on around here?
You may want to
step back a little,
Mr. Krabs.
This could get messy.
Let's hope so.
So you won't talk,
eh, Plankton?
I didn't want to
have to do this.
Plankton,
here comes the pain.
Soap in the eye, eh?
Diabolical!
No! Stop! Don't!
Wait.
That didn't look painful.
Mr. Krabs,
you may not understand
what I'm about to do today,
but someday we'll look back
and have a good laugh.
Wait a minute.
Hey, they're getting away!
Sorry, Mr. Krabs!
So, you've been running
a long con on me, eh?
All these years you've been
working for Plankton!
They're in cahoots!
Yeah, I guess that's
a short way of saying it.
Stop that bubble!
Please tell me there's
something soft below me.
BOTH: Mmm, nope.
KRABS: SpongeBob!
Oh. You were like
an underpaid son to me.
I would've expected Squidward
to stab me in the back.
Huh? What? Huh?
But SpongeBob?
Me most trusted employee?
Working with me sworn enemy?
You know what this means,
Mr. Squidward.
We get the rest
of the day off?
No!
This be but a harbinger
of what I fear lies ahead.
For you. For me.
For all of Bikini Bottom!
The Krabby Patty
is what ties us all together!
Without it, there will be
a complete breakdown
of social order.
A war of all against all!
Dark times are ahead.
Dark times indeed!
Seriously?
Aren't you
overreacting a bit?
ALL: Huh?
Welcome to the apocalypse,
Mr. Squidward.
I hope you like leather.
SQUIDWARD: I prefer suede.
BURGER BEARD: And so
Bikini Bottom became
an apocalyptic cesspool
forevermore.
The end.
Wait a minute.
That's a terrible ending.
Oh, this is bad.
Really bad.
What? What?
SpongeBob's in trouble
and the story's over?
Ouch. Ouch. Ouch.
SEAGULL 1:
Hey, call a therapist!
SEAGULL 2: I have anxiety!
There is no way that
that's the end of this story.
Of course it is.
I'll show you.
Just turn around.
Oh, all right.
Hey!
I need that to fly, you jerk.
"The
"End"!
SEAGULL 4:
Of course it is!
Unhand that book!
You let go of that!
Let go, you numbskull!
You better keep reading,
Mr. Pirate,
or else!
I know
I shouldn't be littering,
but that ending was rubbish!
Rubbish!
Good morning, Squidward.
I'll have the usual.
With cheese.
We're out of Krabby Patties
right now!
No Krabby Patties?
No!
Look what's become
of Bikini Bottom.
We've really gotta
get that formula back.
Hmm. Get the secret formula,
you say?
Excuse me, I need a moment.
With that formula,
I could rule the world!
You know I can
hear you, right?
Well, what do we do now?
Now we work together.
You know, teamwork.
What's, uh, "tee-am work"?
No, Plankton, teamwork.
Tee-am work.
Teamwork.
Tie-'em work.
Teamwork.
Tie 'em up!
Say "team,"
like a sports...
Team.
Team. Now say "work."
Work.
Put them together.
What do you got?
Time bomb work.
Getting better!
Now, Bikini Bottom
Action News!
Oh, hey, Patrick!
Krabby Patty, Krabby Patty,
Krabby Patty, Krabby Patty!
Krabby Patty, Krabby Patty,
Krabby...
Krabby Patty, Krabby...
Krabby Patty...
Krabby...
Krabby!
Come on, tummy,
it's gonna be a long day.
NEWS ANCHOR: We interrupt
your regular program
for an important
news bulletin.
Perch Perkins reporting live
from downtown
Bikini  Bottom.
Complete chaos here today
as our town
attempts to deal with
a sudden and complete shortage
of Krabby Patties. Whoa!
Events here have
this reporter wondering,
what is the secret ingredient
in Krabby Patties anyway?
It's love!
The secret ingredient is love!
No more
Krabby Patties?
If I'd have known that,
I'd have chewed it slower.
Huh?
What the corndog is that?
Come on, Plankton,
it's easy!
It means, I help you,
you help me,
and when
we accomplish our goal,
then we do
hands in the middle.
Hands in the middle?
No, no. Sounds idiotic.
Besides, the two of us
are no match for
that cranky mob!
We could probably
use a few more
tee-am works.
That's exactly
what I was thinking!
Wait, what are you doing?
PATRICK: I
need Krabby Patties!
Patrick, what are you doing?
Krabby Patties!
Vandalizing stuff.
Isn't that your house?
Hey, what's with
all the questions?
Who are you guys?
It's me, your best friend!
SpongeBob?
Oh, yeah?
Well, if you're SpongeBob,
then what's
the secret password?
BOTH: Uh...
Correct! It is you!
SpongeBob!
Whoa!
SpongeBob.
Patrick!
SpongeBob!
Why aren't you
at The Krusty Krab
making Krabby Patties?
Well, I'd love to,
but the formula's gone.
Yeah, Mr. Krabs says
you and Plankton took it.
No, that's not
what happened.
It just disappeared.
We're putting
a team together
to find it.
A team?
Oh! Oh! Pick me!
Pick me! Pick me!
Okay, Patrick, you're in.
PLANKTON:
I don't know, SpongeBob.
What exactly does this clown
bring to the tee-am?
He brings loyalty, Plankton.
Loyalty.
Isn't that right, Patrick?
Yeah, yeah, loyalty.
I've got SpongeBob!
He's over here!
Let's go get him!
Come on, SpongeBob,
let's get out of here!
Patrick!
Patrick, why are you
doing this?
Because I need
Krabby Patties!
Hurry up! I'm hungry!
Over here!
Guys, am I still
on the team?
Hey, what are you
looking at?
Sandy!
Sandy!
Sandy?
Sandy, are you home?
Gee, Plankton,
I wonder where she is.
What is all this stuff?
Sandy?
Don't touch that!
Incoherent muttering.
Sandy? Are you okay?
Okay?
Have you looked outside?
Does that seem "okay" to you?
I'm trying to figure out
what happened to society.
If we don't fix it soon,
there won't be
anything left to fix!
Sandy?
The lack of Krabby Patties
has driven her mad.
And I think
I figgered it out.
Look.
When this came down
from above,
I knew it could
only mean one thing.
And that would be?
It means it's the end!
The sandwich gods
are angry with us!
BOTH: Sandwich gods?
I just don't know
how we're going to
appease them!
PLANKTON:
You got any other friends
who aren't dim bulbs
or nut jobs?
Well, I have one friend
who's loyal to the very end.
Gary, I'm home.
Gare-bear?
Gary?
Gary?
Ugh.
Huh?
Revolting!
But it means
Gary is close by!
Gary, I'm back!
Whoa.
Oh, hey, Gary, Plankton and I
need you to help us find
the Krabby Patty formula
and fix Bikini Bottom.
What do you mean, you don't
have to do as I say anymore?
What do you mean,
"King of Snails"?
Gary The Snail,
you get down here right now
and join this team!
What do you mean,
"Seize them"?
Why are you running?
Because they're
right on our tail.
Oh, right, snails.
Well, so much
for your tee-am.
Putting together
a team is a lot harder
than I thought it would be!
KRABS: This way!
We better get out of here
until things cool off.
SPONGEBOB: Everything we know
and love has been destroyed.
Oh, yeah, looks like
they're gonna have to
change the name
of Bikini Bottom
to Dirty Bottom.
Right, SpongeBob?
That's kind
of gross, Plankton.
Yeah.
Yeah, too soon, huh?
This feels like
it really is the end.
Don't worry, SpongeBob,
we'll find the secret formula
and everything will go back
to the way it was,
you know,
all happy and junk.
Now let's try
and get some sleep.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
Here you are. Feel comfy?
You know, Plankton,
I think you might know
a little bit more
about teamwork
than you let on.
Good night, SpongeBob.
Good night, Plankton.
"Good night," indeed.
That's right,
SpongeBob, sleep.
You're hiding that formula
in there somewhere.
Huh?
Well, here goes nothing.
Huh?
What is this place?
Fudge fight!
Oh, it's all over me!
Ew! It's so sweet in here!
I think my eyeball
is getting a toothache!
FEMALE VOICES:
Hello, Plankton.
Come and play with us.
Hurry
before we melt.
Whoa...
So much sweetness.
I think I'm going
to be sick!
Huh?
Daddy!
Uh, Plankton?
Oh, Plankton!
I just had
the craziest dream!
And you were in it!
I'm sure it was nothing.
Now go back to sleep.
Were you in my brain?
What? No!
That's crazy talk!
Then why is there
cotton candy
on your antenna?
Because, uh, because, uh...
Okay, fine,
I was in your brain.
What were you
doing in there?
What do you think
I was doing?
Looking for
the secret formula.
What?
Don't act so innocent.
You knew what I was up to.
That's why you're pretending
not to know the formula.
I'm not pretending!
I can't believe
you thought I was lying.
Hey, don't take it
personally.
I just assume
everyone is lying.
That is a horrible way
to live your life.
Whatever.
It is! And if we're going
to be on the same team...
Maybe I don't want to be
on the tee-am!
You think of that?
But, Plankton,
everything's better
when you're part of a team.
You're not going
to start singing, are you?
Oh, brother.
¶ We can do anything
when we have teamwork
¶ Don't you think so,
my friend?

All right,
you can put me down.
Well...
That's one minute of my life
I'll never get back.
Not without a time machine.
Wait a minute.
Hold that thought.
Now back up.
Slow down.
Not without
a time machine.
Hmm.
Yes!
SpongeBob,
you're a genius!
I am?
If we build a time machine,
we can go back to before
the formula disappeared.
Before society broke down.
Before we became the hunted!
That sounds great, Plankton,
but how do we build
a time machine?
Well, first we'll need
a computer powerful enough
to calculate the intricacies
of time travel.
Where would
we get one of those?
Hmm.
PLANKTON: There she is.
My computer wife.
They've got her tied up
in the back room.
I've never seen this many
people at The Chum Bucket.
I've never seen
anyone there.
Now was that
really necessary?
Cause the food's really bad.
Oh, come on! Really?
Shh!
How are we gonna
sneak past those guards?
Hmm.
Well, what do we have here?
We better hurry.
Those guys really hate tires.
We'll never get in.
The door's locked.
Hmm.
Wait. The window is open.
Come on, Plankton,
it's time for some teamwork.
Give me a boost.
Okay. Wait a minute, no!
Just a little higher,
Plankton.
Plankton?
Why don't you
boost me up instead?
Oh, yeah, good thinking.
Come on, SpongeBob, come on!
We're in!
Shh!
There's a guard
over there.
Let's take the key
from around his neck.
We're gonna have to be
very quiet.
Let's walk
on the tips of our toes.
Will you stop playing
that tiny piano?
You're gonna get us caught.
Sorry.
Now just reach over
and grab it.
Halt! Who goes there?
Stop! Pull it over his head!
Oh.
Stop, stop, stop!
Let me get up there.
Help me.
What?
No!
Plankton, help!
I'll rock him,
you tell him a bedtime story.
Once upon a time
there was a big fat
pink idiot who went
to sleep. The end!
Nice try,
but it's gonna take
more than that to...
I told you, I don't have
the formula, you monsters!
Hey, baby, how are you?
My hero!
You must need something,
otherwise you wouldn't
have come back.
Plankton has a plan
to save Bikini Bottom.
It doesn't matter, Plankton.
Krabs knows all your plans.
He's been through
my hard drive
looking for
the secret formula.
Eh, I never had it.
But we're going to get it.
We're gonna go back in time
to steal the formula
before it disappeared.
Where are you gonna find
a computer that can do that?
I've never carried
a head before.
PLANKTON:
You'll get used to it.
It's still warm.
So you won't talk, huh?
Let some air out of him.
SPONGEBOB: Is this where
we're gonna build
our time machine?
PLANKTON: Sure.
It's got everything we need.
A photo booth.
A cuckoo clock.
Some day-old chips.
Now all we have to do
is build it.
Oh, no, you don't!
Hey, my pitch pipe!
Uh, I need it.
For the time machine.
Oh. Okay.
Installed!
Mmm.
I did it!
No, we did it!
Wait. We did do it.
As a tee-am.
A team.
Whatever.
BOTH:
¶ Side by side,
we can reach our dreams
¶ 'Cause nothing's impossible
When we're a team ¶
Okay, now for the brains!
It's gonna take
all my processors
and energy to power
this time machine.
So if you have anything
you wanna tell me,
Well, Karen...
I know I've taken you
for granted
all these years, and
I, I just wanted to say,
I'm glad
you're on my tee-am.
that's the sweetest thing
you've ever...
Plankton, are you crying?
No, no, no!
It's just one of the hazards
of having a giant eyeball.
There's always stuff
getting in there.
Anyway,
where were we?
Say "cheese."
Cheese!
According to
my calculations,
The Krusty Krab
should be right here!
What's that over there?
SpongeBob?
Patrick?
Is it really you?
Yes, Patrick, it's...
Finally!
The Great Krabby
Patty Famine is over!
Great Krabby Patty Famine?
Oh, what year is this?
It's Thursday.
According to
my calculations,
we've only gone
four days into the future.
Where is everybody?
They all gave up on you.
But not me!
Cause I'm not very smart.
Where is The Krusty Krab?
Right where
it's always been!
I think we may be
lost in time, Plankton.
Maybe we should ask
this guy for directions.
Excuse me, sir?
Can you tell us when we are?
Who dares disturb
The One Who Watches?
SPONGEBOB:
The One Who Watches?
Your name is
The One Who Watches?
No, my true name is
Bubbles.
Bubbles?
What kind of a name
is Bubbles?
It is my ancient
dolphin name.
So what's a dolphin
doing out here
in the middle of space?
My kind
have been watching
and protecting
the galaxy for...
Hmm.
Oh, so you're the one
keeping the meteors
from hitting us.
BUBBLES: Yes, I am.
And I could really do
with a potty break.
Would you mind
keeping an eye
on things?
Sure thing. But, uh,
what am I keeping my eye on?
What are you doing?
I'm watching.
We don't even know
what we're watching for.
SPONGEBOB:
Maybe we should
split up the workload.
You watch the one
with the big red eye,
I'll watch the one
with the ringy thingies.
Like a team.
Okay, mine's moving.
Mine, too.
No, this doesn't
seem right.
Should we call Bubbles?
Let's give him a minute.
He's been holding it
for 10,000 years.
I'm pretty sure that wasn't
supposed to happen.
Come on, Plankton,
we got to clean this up
before Bubbles gets back!
Much better. Yes.
You two are free to go.
What happened to
Saturn and Jupiter?
You were supposed to...
Keep them from smashing
into each other!
Sorry.
Now
I am going to lose my job!
And you will lose your lives.
Quarter me!
Plankton?
SpongeBob!
Plankton?
SpongeBob?
Who are you two
supposed to be?
I'm you, from the future.
And I'm him from the future.
So you traveled
back through time
to help me?
Great thinking.
Nope. He's helping me.
But he's the enemy!
Was the enemy.
Now we're a team.
What? A tee-am?
A team!
All right,
go get the formula.
What have I become?
All right, Plankton.
Do you have
flying boatmobiles
in the future?
We only came back
from the day
after tomorrow, dimwit.
Are there rocket packs?
Oh!
Did they outlaw
clothes in the future?
No!
Then why are you naked?
Because they don't make
clothes in my size.
Hold still, you!
If you're from the future,
what am I gonna say next?
Something moronic?
Wow.
Hey, hurry up over there!
Uh-oh. That ain't good.
FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE:
Come on, SpongeBob,
we gotta get out of here!
Got it!
Come on!
Oh, that was crazy!
So that's what teamwork is.
All those years
I tried to make you mine,
and I finally did it.
I mean, we did it!
BURGER BEARD:
And so it would seem that
our heroes have accomplished
all they had set out to do.
Now that's an ending.
Whoo-hoo!
Andy, cue the music.
BURGER BEARD: Oh, no.
That's not the end.
So you mean the ending
might be even happier?
MAN 2: Here we go!
Land ho!
BOY: Mom, where's my towel?
What?
BURGER BEARD: Whoa!
MAN: Whoa! Dude, look at that.
WOMAN: What?
I'm coming! Come on,
you lazy people!
Out of my way!
I'm coming!
Out of there!
Sorry!
Too fast!
Slow down!
I'm coming!
No, no!
Yeah!
All right,
you feathered rats,
time to shove off!
What? Why?
Well, I can't have
you pooping
all over my restaurant,
can I?
Restaurant? I thought
this was a pirate ship.
Oh, it is.
But it is also...
A-ha!
My very own food truck!
SEAGULL 1: A what?
Uh, you know,
a restaurant on wheels.
Like a garbage truck.
No!
Are you trying to
scare away my customers?
Well, we're not leaving
till we see
how the story ends.
No problem.
You guys like
a little snack
while you wait?
Sure, I'll take
a curdled milk.
How about a fish head?
And a French fry
covered in sand.
Who wants some
hot wings?
Wait a minute.
Where's Kyle?
Which one of you is next?
SEAGULL 1: He's a madman!
SEAGULL 2:
Let's get out of here!
You crazy, man! You crazy!
SEAGULL 4: Bye-bye, Mr. Poop.
Now I can get
my gold sticker.
Oh, hey, Mr. Piwate.
I wouldn't go in there
if I were you.
Boo!
I can't fly without
my feathers.
Where to, Mac?
Just dwive.
Oh...
Squidward!
Still out of
Krabby Patties.
Does anyone have a picture
of ketchup?
I done figgered it out!
We have angered
the sandwich gods
and only a sacrifice
will appease them!
Well, that sounds
reasonable.
Soon our
post-apoca-whatchamacallit
will be over,
and Krabby Patties
will rain down from above!
Rain down?
Well, that's no good.
How will I get me money?
Oh, you don't like that idea?
Then we'll sacrifice you!
ALL:
Sacrifice! Sacrifice!
It's not a good idea
to have a sacrifice
on an empty stomach.
Who wants a Krabby Patty?
SpongeBob,
is that me formuler?
Oh, happy day!
I missed you so much.
Where was it?
Where did you find it?
Well, Plankton and I
built a time machine
out of an old photo booth
and then we added...
Cheese!
Patrick, wait!
It's okay, everyone.
The post-apocalypse
is almost over!
Ain't that right, SpongeBob?
"Eugene, eat my
"subaquatic air bubbles.
"Love, Plankton"?
You grabbed
the wrong bottle!
I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs!
That's okay, SpongeBob.
We'll just have to sacrifice
the two of you then.
Prepare them
for the sacrifice!
I bring a message
from the dawn of time!
What is it, Patrick?
Run!
Squidosaurus rex!
Well, Plankton,
I guess we failed
to accomplish our goals.
"We"?
But even failure
hurts a little less
when you do it
as a team, right?
This is all your fault!
My fault?
You're the one who stole
the wrong secret formula.
I didn't know
there were two bottles.
Of course you didn't!
Because you got
cotton candy for brains!
ALL: Ooh!
No, seriously,
he really does.
Well, we wouldn't
even be in this mess
in the first place, if you
weren't so selfish and evil.
I was selfish and evil,
until you ruined everything
with your "teamwork"!
Oh! You take that back!
You are the worst
teammate ever!
No!
Oh, my Neptune, he's mixing
garbage and recycling!
Look at me.
Why, I've become
like all of you.
Savage.
Fear-ridden.
Selfish.
An entire town
of formerly good citizens
turned into heartless freaks,
bent on their own
self-prever...
Self-preter...
"Preservation?"
Yes!
We've become alienated
from each other.
Each one an island
unto himself,
concerned only with
ourselves.
And in the name
of all fishhood,
I am not about
to let that happen!
And so,
if a sacrifice
is needed to restore
Bikini Bottom
to its former glory...
Then I am willing
to take one for the team!
You heard him!
ALL:  Sacrifice!
Sacrifice! Sacrifice!
Sacrifice!
Sacrifice! Sacrifice!
Let the sacrifice begin!
ALL:
Patties! Patties!
And I thought
my friends were primitive.
Don't cry, me boy.
Everything's going
to be fine, for us.
Oh, I'm not crying,
Mr. Krabs.
I smell Krabby Patties!
That's right. Keep thinking
happy thoughts. Now!
ALL:
Sacrifice! Sacrifice!
The boy's right.
MAN: My leg!
I smell 'em, too!
Okay, SpongeBob, go get it!
Wait. You mean we can
just take this stuff off?
Go find that Krabby Patty!
Come on, everybody!
I've got some Krabby Patty
orders to fill!
It's coming from over there!
Come on, guys, I think
it's just over this hill.
How do you expect us
to go up to the surface?
We won't be able to breathe!
All right,
all secondary characters
come with me.
Yeah, I'm with you guys.
No way, Squidward.
You're going up there
with us.
My feet hurt.
Patrick, you don't
have feet.
It's not fair!
You have feet.
Sandy has feet.
Squidward has feet.
Actually,
I have four feet.
SPONGEBOB:
It's not about feet.
SQUIDWARD:
What is it about, then?
SPONGEBOB:
It's about being a team
and sticking together,
no matter what!
The only way we're going
up there is if some
fairy godmother shows up
and helps us breathe air.
Bubbles!
SpongeBob,
you know this guy?
Don't hurt us!
We're sorry we got you fired.
Hurt you?
Why, I traveled back
through time to thank you.
I've been stuck
in that job for eons.
I needed a change,
but I was too afraid
to go for it.
Well, Bubbles,
I'm glad we could help.
Now it is my turn to help.
I can get you safely
to the surface.
Now!
Quick, all of you,
get in my mouth.
Come on, guys, let's go!
There's no way I'm climbing
into some dolphin's mouth.
Yeah. This guy
just wants a free lunch.
Guys, if Bubbles
has the courage
to quit his dead-end,
nowhere job
and travel back through time
to help us,
then we need
to have the courage to...
Well, I never thought
I'd be eaten by a dolphin.
No, if he was eating us,
he'd be chewing us up
and we'd be going down there.
This is what you call
riding in style.
Not a lot
of legroom in here.
Well, maybe if you
didn't have four feet!
Note to self:
Never stow away
in a gym sock.
What's happening?
I feel tingly!
SQUIDWARD: Ow, my neck!
I've done all I can.
The rest is up to you.
Thank you, Bubbles!
Farewell, SpongeBob.
Farewell, Bubbles.
Now to update my...
Resume!
Ah! Fresh air!
Oh, how I've missed you.
Ugh! This place
smells awful!
Come on, guys.
Let's get
the Krabby Patty formula
and save Bikini Bottom.
Whoa!
What is this place?
KRABS: I have
a bad feeling about this.
Maybe this guy knows
where we are.
He looks smart.
He's got five heads.
Uh, sir? Could you tell us
where to find a Krabby Patty?
Hey, my friend's
talking to you!
What?
A giant, hairy porpoise!
It's beached!
It's suffering.
Poor thing.
Y'all, those aren't
porpoises.
All hands on deck!
Oh, brother.
We need to get these guys
back in the water.
SPONGEBOB: Come on! Push!
KRABS: Heave!
ALL: Ho!
Heave!
ALL: Ho!
Heave!
ALL: Ho!
Put your back into it!
Come on, push!
SQUIDWARD: Well, I guess
this is where that
horrible smell
was coming from.
Whoa!
Excuse me, do you know
where we can get
a Krabby Patty around here?
Invaders!
Uh-oh.
You get out of
my sister's sand castle!
GIRL: Mom!
Oh!
Where have you been
all my life?
Ow. Whoa!
WOMAN: Mmm.
Oh, Frank.
That feels so good.
Gross!
Oh, hey, Squidward.
Sandy!
The Krabby Patty!
I think I see
where it's coming from!
SpongeBob, you will not
believe the size
of the ice creams here.
I wonder what other
giant snacks they have.
Cotton candy?
Wow.
If you ate all that,
you'd have enough energy
to run around
the whole world!
BOTH: Whoo-hoo!
Ugh! When is the sugar
gonna wear off?
Hey, guys,
I smell Krabby Patties!
I think it's this way!
Huh?
KRABS: Don't leave me,
Squidward!
Now what?
We're never going to
make it!
ALL: Huh?
Heave!
Ho!
Heave!
Ho!
Heave!
Ho!
We're doing it, guys!
MAN: Dude, watch out!
Hold on!
SQUIDWARD: SpongeBob!
Huh? Lean!
Starboard!
ALL: Whoa!
What the...
What?
"Home of the Krabby Patty"?
But The Krusty Krab
is the home
of the Krabby Patty!
Mr. Krabs,
what are we gonna do?
$8.99 for a Krabby Patty?
Why didn't I think of that?
You!
Huh?
Cease and desist that
unauthorized patty flipping!
Yeah, that's my job!
BURGER BEARD:
How did you get here?
You cannot breathe air.
Well, there was
this magical dolphin
from the future who shot us
out of his blowhole, and...
Wait! Wait.
That's not in the book.
Book?
There is no magical dolphin
in this story.
What story?
The story
of how Bikini Bottom
was brought to its knees
when its beloved
Krabby Patty formula
was stolen by me,
Burger Beard.
How does it end?
Well, let me see.
It looks like, uh,
Burger Beard
becomes the richest
food truck proprietor
in all the land.
But how did you
steal the formula?
That was easy.
I simply rewrote
the story, and...
Poof!
Me formuler!
What do you mean,
rewrote the story?
Watch this.
"The brave
"and handsome
"Burger Beard
"banished our poor heroes..."
"...to be stranded on
"Pelican Island!"
"The End"!
Oh, this looks bad.
And these guys
look hungry!
Look out!
Nice. So this is
what teamwork gets you.
Here! Take Squidward,
you vile beasts!
I want to be on a new team.
This one's broken.
Sandy, you're smart.
You have any ideas?
I ain't been too smart
since I found
this old piece of paper!
What?
KRABS: Incoming!
Wait a minute!
Now all we need
is some ink!
Oh. Which Squidward
has helpfully provided.
It happens when I'm nervous.
Whatever you're going to do,
make it quick!
They're closing in on us!
I'm gonna write us an ending.
Will it be a happy ending?
It's going to be
superpowered!
I'll show you
a happy ending.
Huh?
Da-da-da-da!
Patrick!
Huh?
Hey, I got feet!
Oh, what is in these things?
We'll take one
secret formula to go!
Clear the area, citizens.
There's going to be
some serious
aft-kicking here.
But I banished you.
Sour Note?
SEAGULL 1:
My tiny little eardrums!
Hey, hey, wait!
Hold on! Hold on!
Wait! Wait! Customers!
Wait, please!
SPONGEBOB:
Mr. Superawesomeness,
take him down.
Huh?
Huh?
Um, maybe we
should have picked
a better superpower
for you, Patrick.
Let's see you get out
of this one!
Ka-ching!
Get ready
for the Invinci-Bubble!
No!
My book!
All right, team,
time for hands in the middle!
Yes! Huh?
Oh, yeah.
Great job, guys.
We did it!
ALL: Ew!
Huh?
What?
Sandy? Is that you?
You can call me The Rodent!
Hi-yah!
Hey, where'd the pirate go?
Hmm. Uh...
Mmm.
It looks like Burger Beard
forgot the first rule
of mobile fry cooking.
Always batten down
your grease traps.
Follow that grease, team!
BURGER BEARD:
There she blows.
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
SPONGEBOB: Whoo-hoo!
SPONGEBOB: Whoo!
Oh, no, you don't.
Ow!
Oh!
He's after the book!
Sandy, use your
squirrel powers!
Roger that!
Oh, she's never gonna
make it!
Huh? Everyone...
Lean!
That's what you get.
Come here.
Come here.
The book!
Sour Note!
All right, Burger Beard,
prepare to be teamworked!
I'm going to scrub
my armpits with you.
Uh, I don't get it.
Because you're a sponge.
Duh.
Oh.
Get him, The Rodent!
Consider him roasted!
Huh?
Aw, nuts!
I'm all out of nuts!
Justice is best soft served.
Patrick, I should have
never doubted your powers!
I can't think
of a sweeter way to go.
Ha! It's all mine!
Not so fast, Booger Beard!
Me formuler. Huh?
This will make you
feel a little butter.
Not melted butter!
Mr. Krabs!
Uh-oh.
A-ha!
Oh, yeah!
Huh?
Hoo-hoo!
Ta-da!
They're beautiful!
Patrick!
BURGER BEARD: I gotcha!
SpongeBob!
Patrick?
Talk to me, buddy.
I'm... I'm seeing
a bright light.
Is this better?
Much. Thank you.
But the discomfort I feel
in my eyes is nothing
compared to the shame I feel
for letting down the Patty.
For letting down
Bikini Bottom.
Yeah, SpongeBob,
you really blew it.
No, Patrick, we blew it,
as a team.
Nope. This one's on you.
PLANKTON: Where do you
think you're going?
Why don't you get going,
little fella,
before you hurt yourself?
Plankton?
It's Plank-Ton!
Come on down from there,
little fella.
You wouldn't want to
get hurt.
Huh?
Come out, come out,
wherever you are!
Huh?
My eye!
He's getting away!
Ready for a Plank-Ton
of bubbles?
The formula, please.
Come on. Team up with me.
We'll be rich
and powerful! Huh?
PLANKTON: No, thanks.
I'm already
part of a teamwork.
Can we do hands
in the middle again?
Yes, we can, Patrick.
But this time,
there's one more hand
to go in the middle.
Plankton?
Hmm.
Oh, no.
Here you go, Krabs.
Huh?
She's all yours.
This doesn't have
another insulting
note in it, does it?
No, that's the old me.
The one who turned his back
on everything important
just to have that formula
all to himself.
But I realize now
that keeping
something to myself is...
Selfish.
Especially
when that something
is the Krabby Patty.
Okay, everybody,
let's get back
to Bikini Bottom and...
Oh, no!
I don't have the page!
Oh, no!
SPONGEBOB: It must be
back on Pelican Island!
Don't worry.
I thought of everything.
All right, SpongeBob,
take us home.
Thanks.
Squidward!
Oh, yeah.
Come on,
it's time to go back
and open up The Krusty Krab!
Are you out of your
patty-flipping mind?
I'll never leave this place!
I mean, look at me.
I'm a god!
No, Squidward,
you're a cashier.
Wait a minute! What? No!
Well, it was fun
while it lasted.
Don't be sad, Squidward.
I left you a little surprise
under your shirt!
SQUIDWARD: Rock-hard abs!
Aw, SpongeBob,
you're okay in my book.
Aw, shucks.
Excuse us! We'd like 3,000
Krabby Patties, please!
That sound must mean
things are back to normal.
Who wants
First one's for you, Gary.
Extra mayo,
just the way you like it.
A-ha!
Caught you red-handed!
Gary hates mayo.
Plankton!
Up to your old tricks
again already, eh?
Hey, I'm just
putting things back
the way they were.
What do you have
to say about this, Gary?
Oh, shrimp.
See you later,
tee-am-mate!
Now can we sing it?
SEAGULLS: Yeah!
Pwease, Mr. Piwate?
Oh, Kyle...
How can I say no to you?
Are you ready, kids?
SEAGULLS: Aye-aye, Captain!
Uh, what did you say?
There's sand in my ears and
I can't hear you!
SEAGULLS: Aye-aye, Captain!
ALL:
¶ Who lives in
a pineapple under the sea?
ALL:
¶ Absorbent and yellow
and porous is he!
ALL:
¶ If nautical nonsense
be something you wish
ALL:
¶ Then drop on the deck
and flop like a fish!
ALL:
Ready?
ALL:
ALL:
ALL:
Silence!
Oh, man. I like that song.
What happened?
I don't like that song
and I put an end to it.
Well, this music
is terrible.
I suppose
you're entitled to your...
Wait. Why am I
talking to you?
¶ What could you know
about taste?
¶ You get excited by
a pile of trash on a plate
¶ That song's so bad
That I can't even stand it
¶ Dispense with this
nonsense at once
¶ Against my power
Don't try it
¶ Just sit there with
your flappy beak shut
¶ You can't insult us
¶ The Seagull crew
¶ We're floating on the breeze
Party in seven seas
¶ You got your nose
on your head
¶ You blow up
when you sneeze
¶ 'Cause he's older
than a fossil
Here, knock it off!
Yer making the movie
too long!
¶ Why don't you
take us back in time
¶ So we can finish
our song? ¶
Fine.
ALL:
That was pretty good,
actually.
PATRICK: Oh, yeah, sorry!
This dance is so last year.
You know what this needs?
A little interpretive dance!
