This is so beautiful.
You know it, Gary.
Look at her.
Do you know
what I'd like to do?
Shower with them.
Then we hit
the city, baby,
dead on,
for a little drinks,
a little nightlife,
dancing--
Dancing.
We throw a huge party,
I mean  party--
Everybody's invited,
women everywhere.
All these girls,
they're all there.
Naked bodies everywhere.
Gary.
They'll know my name.
What?
Nobody likes us.
Nobody.
Why are you messing
with the fantasy?
We know about
the reality.
Don't ruin
the fantasy, okay?
And then,
we're a hit, man.
We're popular.
We're revered.
Man, we're studs.
When the smoke clears,
right...
those two dames
fall amazingly,
completely,
and totally in love
with us, Wyatt.
Check it out.
Yo!
Check us out!
Look, we're
sorry about--
Where did your
parents go, anyway?
Cincinnati.
They're meeting the guy
my sister wants to marry.
Chloe? Who the hell
would marry Chloe?
He's studying
to be a vet.
Don't make a mess.
The maid doesn't come
till Monday.
How come your parents
suddenly trust you?
Chet's coming home
from college
for the weekend.
He's in charge.
Chet? Shit!
You should have
told me this
before I agreed
to sleep over.
How do you
put up with him?
If I don't,
he beats the shit
out of me.
It's a habit
he picked up
in military school.
He's very
protective of me.
Nice relationship.
!
.
.
.
G.
.
.
--
.
.
.
.
.
...
--
.
It's not a bad idea.
What?
...
Making a girl.
Actually making a girl...
just like Frankenstein,
except cuter.
!
!
.
You're serious.
Yes.
Look me in the eyes.
Do I look serious?
!
.
Gary Wallace,
that's absolutely gross.
I'm not digging up
dead girls.
I'm not talking about
digging up a dead girl.
I'm talking about
your computer, idiot.
You can simulate stuff
on your computer.
Why can't we
simulate a girl?
I guess I could,
but why?
It's two-dimensional
on the screen.
It's not
flesh and blood.
But we can
ask it questions.
We'll put it in
real-life sexual situations
and see how it reacts.
Well, what about
your girl in Canada?
She lives in Canada.
She has no morals.
I don't like that
in a girl.
Anyway, get to work.
Very nice.
Hold it, Wyatt.
I know female stats.
Anything bigger
than a handful,
you're risking
a sprained tongue.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Perfect.
Okay. Now what?
Should we give her
a brain?
Yeah. We'll play chess
with her.
Chess? Just give her
a brain.
That's all we can do
with my stuff.
Did you get
a free toaster
with this, too?
The problem is,
this is a lame idea.
Your computer
is a wimp.
We need
a lot more power.
What do you suggest?
We're in.
We're in trouble, Gary.
This is highly illegal.
We got to
fill this thing
with data.
We'll make her
as real as possible.
I want her
to live, breathe.
I want her
to aerobicize.
!
!
It's moving,
it's working.
It's working
by itself.
--
But, Gary...
by the way,
why are we wearing
bras on our heads?
Ceremonial.
You ready?
Yeah.
Let's go.
Turn it off!.
It  off!.
Hang up the phone!
Wyatt,
what's going on?
I don't know!
Unplug it!
Oh, shit!
Arf!. Arf!.
No!
It's a birthday present!
Oh, shit!
Oh, shit!
Let's get this thing
out of your house!
You get it out!
This is
all your fault!
I'll get it out!
Whoa!
What the hell is it?
Oh, shit!
One, two, three.
!
Uhhhhh.
So what would you
little maniacs
like to do first?
You guys created me.
I didn't come
from anywhere.
Before you messed around
with your computer,
I didn't even exist.
By the way,
you did an excellent job.
Thank you.
Hello?
Isn't showering real fun?
If we're going to have
fun together,
you guys
had better loosen up.
What're we gonna
do with her?
We'll just go
with the situation.
By Sunday, you'll
think of something.
You're
a very bright guy.
I'm just
being practical.
I know.
I appreciate it.
Let's go.
What about
this mess?
Clean it up
tomorrow.
Okay, but don't get
B.O. on Chet's suit,
or he'd kill me.
Where are we going?
We're going
downtown and--
Oh, my God!
Whose stuff is this?
Is that yours?
Gary, I don't know--
What is
going on here?
I don't know!
You look good, though, okay?
Did you steal
this car?
No.
How did you get it?
I can get
anything I want.
Right now,
I want to party.
Party?
Yeah. Think up
a name for me.
What name
do you want?
You think of one.
Lisa.
Why Lisa?
Why not?
He used to like
a girl named Lisa.
Oh, yeah?
Old girlfriend?
She kicked him
in the nuts.
Will you shut up?
It wasn't
your fault.
All you said was
hello to her.
Shut up!
Guys, I like Lisa.
That'll do just fine.
You guys
ready to rock?
Ready.
Ready.
Lisa?
Yeah?
I don't think
we belong here.
Don't be silly.
It's a public place.
We'd both
love to stay,
but we're not 21 .
You're 21 .
You're 21 .
Maybe you'd feel better
if you mingled.
We don't mingle, okay?
Then we'll invite these people
to your house
and we could all
mingle there.
We'll mingle.
We'll mingle.
Hi, dudes.
Well, goddamn!
Listening to
this blues music
reminds me
of my own trials
and tribulations
as a young guy.
My folks
really dump on me.
You guys get along
with your parents?
I guess you guys
moved out by now.
Uh, what's this, sir?
Drink it.
That's a very
sweet thought,
but I really don't--
Until now.
See you guys
in the emergency room.
Pretty lady,
what's a beautiful broad
like you...
doing with a malaca
like this?
It's purely sexual.
No shit.
She's into
malacas, Dino.
Ha ha ha ha ha!
She's into malacas!
Do you believe that?
Ha ha ha ha ha!
You can
say that again!
Fats, man, let me tell you
my story, man.
Last year,
I was insane for this
crazy little 8th-grade bitch.
Crazy insane?
Insane?
Crazy?
I was nuts
for the woman, man.
I'm tellin'
the truth here.
I was nuts for the girl.
She had big titties.
She wouldn't have had
to worry about no titties
for the rest of her life.
That's the truth.
I called her every night
for like a month.
Every damn night?
Every night, Mitch.
What's this boy
talkin' about,
on the telephone?
Explain it
to him.
We know
there's a telephone.
But he hung up
on her.
The chick with
those big titties?
You know what
the bitch did to me?
Lay it on me.
Listen--
She kneed you
in the nuts.
She did what?
Bitch kneed your nuts?
Bitch kneed my nuts!
In the family
jewels?
.
Broke my heart in two.
She broke more
than your heart.
.
You got
this fine jewel
sitting by you.
Ain't that the truth,
baby?
That's the plain truth!
Party's over.
Party's over,
says the girl.
Here's money for you--
$50 for you,
$50 for you.
I'll bet $5 that boy
won't make it
through the club.
d Woo, baby d
d Woo, baby d
d You know I love you d
I really shouldn't
be driving.
Listen,
I appreciate it.
I don't feel
like driving.
Okay, forget it.
I'll drive.
Give me the keys!
Will he
be all right?
I warned him about
that blind dog bourbon.
He don't have
a license.
I don't even have
a learner's permit.
Hey, let's scout
another party, man.
What will you
tell Chet about me?
Nothing.
Nothing?
That's not very
realistic, Wyatt.
I'm just trying
to concentrate
on the road.
Concentrate harder.
You're running
a red light.
Oh, shit!
I hate that stuff!.
I never listen to it!
I hate this car!
Are you okay?
My nuts
are halfway up my ass.
Other than that,
I'm perfect.
Think of what
you'll do about Chet.
He's one serious idiot.
You're stewed, butt-wad!
Who, me?
Know what time it is?
Uh, 2:00?
Time to pay the fiddler.
I was kind of
counting on you
to be human about this.
Here's the
bottom line, Wyatt.
I'm telling Mom and Dad
everything.
And I'm even considering
making up some shit.
All right, Chet.
Name your price.
$1 7 5 and zero cents,
cash--
New bills,
crisp and clean,
in my wallet by 7 A.M.
Thank you.
Hey, what are
big brothers for?
See you upstairs.
How to be jilted.
Pllllttt.
Shh.
Shh.
The boozehounds return.
What a joke!
Hi, girls.
How about a nice
greasy pork sandwich
served in
a dirty ashtray?
He pukes, you die.
He's not laughing
at you, Chet.
.
Did you tell Chet
about the woman
we made tonight?
He's drunk.
No shit.
No shit, Chet.
You donkey dicks
couldn't get laid
in a morgue.
You're absolutely right.
You're absolutely
right, Chet.
Hey, Gary.
What?
Ha ha ha ha!
He's an asshole.
Look at his haircut.
Anybody with
a haircut like that
.
Psst. Lisa.
Where are you?
I'm right behind you.
Surprise!
I won't hurt you.
Your lips feel like
rigor mortis has set in.
Relax a little bit.
I wasn't expecting you
to kiss me.
I mean, I was just--
I was...uh...
That was better.
Want to try it again?
If you don't mind.
I mean,
yes, please, ma'am.
Mmph!
You sure
you're only 1 5?
I'll be 1 6 in June.
You made me.
You control me.
What are you
thinking about, huh?
Um...
women's gymnastics.
Well, I don't know.
I'll do my best.
Good.
Oh.
Wyatt, Wyatt,
Wyatt, where are you?
I'm right here, Gary.
What happened?
I don't know.
I think
it was a dream.
What?
Everything--
Last night, Lisa.
It had to be a dream.
.
Two people can't have
the same dream.
It had to be a dream.
did I get up
in the middle
of the night
.
Maybe it was a dream,
you know--
A very weird, bizarre,
.
Maybe we have malaria.
Shit.
Gary! Wyatt!
!
I don't
have the bucks
to pay Chet off
about this.
You can't fear Chet
the rest of your life.
Why not?
Please...
I don't know, Wyatt.
I mean, it's seriously
affecting your sex life.
.
You slept.
I did my toes.
By the way,
you're very cute.
We'll try it again
sometime.
Good morning,
turd brain.
Hi, Chet.
You spit in this?
Not that
I'm aware of, no.
Hey, that looks
pretty good.
Now make yourself one,
dick weed.
I like your panties.
It's a joke, Chet.
That's not a joke!
That is a severe
behavioral disorder.
Those are women's
underpants!
Next you'll be wearing
a bra on your head.
The old man's
going to have a stroke.
All right, Chet.
How much?
How much?
This goes way beyond
payment, pal.
Come on, Chet.
Please?
Well...
your VCR
should cover it...
for openers.
Thank you.
For Christ's sakes,
will you cover yourself?
You guys looking
for something
for your mom?
I really don't
think so...Sue.
Do you guys have,
uh...girlfriends?
One does not refer to
a 23-year-old woman
as a girlfriend.
Uh, mistress, Gar.
Um, lover.
Sexpot.
She's a sexpot.
at the homecoming
game, right?
Do you think
you could wrap up
a bottle of
this scent for me?
.
Set yourself up
with one, too.
Three scents, please.
If you were
a 1 5-year-old boy,
would these
turn you on?
I think so, too.
I'll take them.
Do you have a bra
to match that...
something leather,
rubber, or barbed wire?
Give me a break.
Check it out.
What?
Five bucks?
Finsky.
Max, what
will you do?
For the first time
in my life,
I don't feel like
a total dick.
Yeah, me either.
Ha ha ha ha ha!
!
Sorry, boys.
Momentary loss
of motor control.
There's a big
white sale going on...
at Towel World!
We're not impressed.
Can I have some
of that, please?
Their shit bores me.
Should we dump them?
We've been with them
three months.
We've been
to all the parties.
We won't go
to any more parties.
We'll go into
a social coma.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Let's give them
another chance.
Okay.
Will you
forgive us?
Oh, you guys.
What will
we do with you?
Excuse me!
We got her,
we got her.
Hey!
Hey.
Hi.
That's Ian.
This is Max.
We call him Mad Max.
.
You were looking
at us, right?
Yeah.
So what
are you doing?
Nothing.
I'm waiting
for my ride.
come on, hon.
We're late.
.
Speak
to you later.
She likes the rough stuff.
What can I do?
There's a party tonight
at Wyatt's house.
You can find his name
in the students' directory
.
.
Party?
Don't ask.
You'll have a heart attack
by the time you're 40.
Learn to relax.
Have you tried
inversion boots?
Lisa, you don't
understand my parents.
What's there
to understand?
They're oppressive,
meddlesome,
difficult, demanding,
and totally bizarre.
They're normal parents.
Go get dressed.
Lisa, I created you.
Why do you do things
I don't want?
You and Gary want friends,
you want popularity,
you want
all that stuff, right?
I thought about it.
Sure, but--
So I'm
giving it to you.
Thank you,
but I don't want it
in my house.
If you want to be
a party animal,
learn to live
in the jungle.
.
I'll pick up Gary.
I can't wait
to meet his parents.
Do you go
to Gary's school?
Do I look like
I'm in high school?
No.
.
They have a different
educational system
.
You look very...
mature.
Doesn't she?
I was thinking
the same thing.
What do you do
for a living, Al?
I'm an independent
businessman.
.
.
I guess you plumb,
right, Dad?
Yeah.
I think
it's time to go.
You ready?
Where are you going?
To a party.
To a movie.
Movie party,
is what it is.
No. I've whipped up
this nasty soiree
at his friend
Wyatt's house.
Soir what?
Soiree, honey.
I think
that means party.
Party.
There's going to be
sex, drugs, rock n' roll,
--
.
I'm not talking
candle wax on the nipples--
.
I've heard enough!
Gary, get to your room!
Yes, sir!
It's okay.
I'll handle this.
Girlie, get out
before I throw you out.
Don't threaten me, Al!
You're out of shape.
I'll kick your ass.
.
I'm taking Gary
to a party.
Over my dead body.
He's a good kid.
He studies hard.
If anybody
should be bitching,
it should be Gary.
Or on anything?
Hey! Hey!
Compliments
embarrass me.
Shut up!
Shut up!
It's so sad that your son's
only sexual outlet
is tossing off to magazines
in the bathroom.
Oh, Gary!
I never tossed off!.
!
I was!
Gary, shut up!
Water's running
all day.
Shut up!
I never tossed off!.
And you wouldn't tell
your own mother!
Shut up!
Shut up!
This guy
deserves a party.
Look, I don't know
who you are,
what you are,
or where you came from,
but I'm not taking
any more of this.
Dial the police, Lucy,
and give me the phone.
I'm going to get the--
Give me the phone.
Well, here it is.
Jesus, God.
.
.
Oh.
Whoa.
Go ahead...
make your day?
I'm sorry it has to
come to this.
Come to what?
Cheer up, or I'll
blow your face off.
Don't be
such an old lady.
Everything's cool.
Everything's cool!
My dad's going to
castrate me.
My mother almost had
a cardiac arrest.
I'll be grounded
till I'm 45.
Other than that,
everything's great.
Couldn't be better.
Trust me for once,
will you?
They don't know
what happened.
Did you think
Gary was acting
a little strangely
this evening?
Gary?
Who's Gary?
Lisa, promise me
things won't get
out of control.
Don't worry.
You're just having
a few friends over.
I don't have
any friends.
He doesn't.
Boy ain't lying.
You do now.
Hi.
Hi!
Hi!
Hi!
!
!
!
!
Ho!
How you doing?
How you doing?
Where's the bar?
Bar!
Do you think they'll
embarrass us tonight?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Caviar?
If Max and Ian
see her,
it's over for us.
How's your stomach?
Better.
If you're gonna
float an air biscuit,
let me know.
Float a what?
If you fart,
I'll hit the fan.
Sorry. I suffer
pain and discomfort
due to occasional
stomach upset.
We always talk about
how great it would be
if we went to parties.
Now it's our party,
hundreds of people
are having fun,
and we're in theJohn.
You're as uptight
as I am.
Nobody can be
as uptight as you.
Your middle name
is tense--
Wyatt ''Tense Up''
Donnely.
It's not that bad.
We can hear the music.
Maybe if we put
our noses to the door,
we can smell the food.
Hey, brother!
What's happening,
my main man?
Right on!
Scotch.
Straight up?
Give me
the whole bottle.
Bend over.
I'll shove it
straight up your ass.
On the rocks is fine.
Ha ha ha ha!
Yeah, that's what
I thought you'd say.
There she is.
You deal
with the drinks.
.
I wonder
if Lisa's having fun.
Lisa could have fun at
an insurance seminar, Wyatt.
The thing
that really galls me
is that she's ours
and we can't
get close to her.
Hit the fan.
This is
the best party
I've ever been to.
It's great!
Whose house is this?
It's probably
that girl with
the English accent.
She doesn't have a zit
on her whole body.
She has zero fat.
And she's so relaxed.
She burped
and it was charming.
Uh, yeah.
The bathroom.
Ladies.
Hi.
Hi.
Hi.
!
!
Light a match!
Light a fire!
Hi.
Hi.
Hi.
We thought there were
just girls in there.
It's just us dudes.
Why are you here?
Gary was just
taking a shit.
I meant--
What are you doing
at the party?
Oh, it's my house.
This is your party?
We like to do this
once a week,
throw little
get-togethers.
Haven't you guys
been by?
How did we
miss these two?
So many people,
so many parties.
So many parties.
You lose track.
Can I come in
and check my face?
What's wrong with it?
Can we come in?
Come on in.
Sure. Be our guests.
Thanks, guys.
We've seen you
at school,
but we've never met.
You're Hilly.
You're Deb.
Hi. I'm Gary.
Hi, Gary.
What have you guys
been doing--
I didn't know you guys
had so many friends.
Neither did we.
Who's the girl
with the accent?
I thought
this was her party.
You mean the sensuous
sex symbol type?
Yeah.
Yeah.
.
She's with...you guys?
Come on, Lisa.
Why not?
Because I belong
to Gary and Wyatt.
Did they make you
in the garage
with power tools?
Do they own you?
.
Seriously.
They're toads.
Do I look like
I'd go out with two toads?
.
Gary and Wyatt
will force everyone
to redefine their terms.
And you're completely
loyal to them?
I do whatever they say.
Hi.
Could you excuse us
for a minute, please?
No problem.
We'll be in here.
Okay, fine.
They're stoked
for us.
Should we go for it?
What about Lisa?
She said we should party.
Let's score points
with these two.
We'll deal with
the mechanics later.
Sounds good.
Let's not hurt
Lisa's feelings.
She wants
a bone job from me.
Ready to party?
Let's break!
Those guys are weird,
but they're kinda cute.
Hi.
Where did you two
disappear to?
We were in
the bathroom.
We were
in the kitchen.
Eating.
Doing our hair.
Have you met
Gary and Wyatt?
Yes.
No.
Sort of.
If you get the chance,
shower with them.
I did.
It's a mind scrambler!
Oh, hurts so good.
She took a shower
with them.
I have a wonderful
idea, Henry.
After dinner,
let's stop by
and visit Wyatt.
He's alone
at home tonight.
Doesn't he have
anything to read?
I don't know, dear,
but nothing's
more important
to a teenage boy
than his grandparents.
We'll drop by.
Ha ha ha!
Yeah! Woo!
I'd like to apologize
for the Icee today at the mall.
It was very immature.
I'm sorry.
It was just,
like, tomfoolery.
.
It happened.
What's the deal
with Lisa?
Can we borrow her?
We can't do that, guys.
Common decency
prohibits us.
We can't.
It's not cool.
Well, she said
it was cool.
We can't take advantage
of her loyalties.
That's really
selfish.
Just forget it, guys.
We can't do it,
you know?
Come on.
Quit being pricks.
Hey, come on.
our feelings for Lisa
run very deep.
So do ours
for Deb and Hilly.
It's respect, the time
you spent together.
You guys deserve them.
.
Let us have
a crack at Lisa
and Deb and Hilly
are yours.
Can you guys
keep a secret?
Sure.
A secret?
Look again.
It's Gary.
No, no.
It's our boy, Gary.
He's our
I don't know
what the hell you're
talking about, Lucy.
I feel
like an asshole.
This had better work.
This is just
the blueprint.
You like it?
Bigger tits.
Bigger tits.
Go, go, go, go!
G
.
Excuse me, Arthur.
It's Art.
Excuse me, Art.
Oh, shit.
Aah!
.
.
Oh!
Oh! Oh! Oh!
What's going on?
Turn this thing off!.
You'll love it!
I'm shitting
in my pants!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah! Aah!
Aah! Aah! Aah!
Whoa!
Aah!
Aah!
It worked.
You had to be big shots,
didn't you?
You had to show off.
People will like you
for what you are,
not for what
you can give them.
you forgot
one small detail.
We forgot to
hook up the doll.
You forgot to
hook up the doll.
Something's
going on here,
Carmen.
I have a feeling
we won't approve, Henry.
A missile!
A missile!
A missile
in my house, Gary!
This puppy's
for real, all right.
It was an accident.
It happens--
Accident my ass, Gary!
My parents and Chet
will freak out!
They'll shit egg rolls.
Get out!
Get out! Scat!
Out! Disgusting tramps!
You, you, you...
hosers!
Out! Out!
Stop that!
You shouldn't walk
into somebody's house
and hit people
with your hat.
This is
my daughter's home.
Who are you?
I'm a close
personal friend
of your grandson's.
Henry,
call the police.
I'll have you
incarcerated.
Here's the deal--
Gary and Wyatt--
they created me
on their computer.
I'm not going to listen
to this baloney.
He doesn't stand
for baloney.
Do you mind waiting?
I won't be a moment.
Have you ever?
Never.
Wyatt, your
grandparents
are downstairs.
Okay. Thanks, Lis.
Lisa!
Yes?
Where are
my grandparents?
Your kitchen
is blue.
Want to try one?
Where are
my grandparents?
They're all
taken care of.
You're going to
love this one.
Are they all right?
They're fine.
They're
better than fine.
They're not aging
anymore.
.
If any more
of his relatives
drop by,
we'll be upstairs
in the bathroom.
Those guys really need
some self-confidence,
a challenge--
.
I'm so bloody clever.
Now!
Aaah!
Aaah!
Aaah!
Arrggghhh!
Ha ha ha ha!
This Bud's for you.
Arrggghhh!
This party's lame, Max.
What about the girls?
Girls, shmirls.
Aaah!
Aaah!
!
What's going on?
Aaah!
Arrggghhh!
Aaah!
Oh!
Oh!
Gary!
Gary, listen to me.
There are motorcycles
in my house!
There are killer mutants
in your house, okay?
Screw the house.
Screw the house.
Aaaaahhhh!
Ha ha ha ha!
Guys, you have
uninvited guests.
Ask them to leave.
They're getting
pretty rowdy.
Ha ha ha ha!
This is
an excellent chance
for you to prove your
bravery and courage.
Those are outdated concepts.
Don't letJohn Wayne
hear you say that.
The man is dead!
So are you
if you don't deal
with this situation.
No, thanks.
No, thanks.
Gary, do you feel
like a chicken?
If I could shoot
an egg out my ass,
I would.
Will all these people
think we're cowards?
I don't know.
We can deal with shame.
Death is
a much deeper issue.
Aah!
Aah!
Grrr.
We'll get you guys
some drinks.
You look like
a scotch man.
Arrggghhh!
Is this your party?
Uh...well, kind of.
I don't know if
you can call it a party.
It's, um,
just a few friends.
How come two
unpopular dicks
like you
is having a party?
.
Dicks sometimes do
the weirdest things.
I don't know.
How would you like
all your friends here
to know that you wear
a bra on your heads?
Ha ha ha ha!
Ha ha!
Tossed off into
any good books
lately, have we?
Ha ha ha ha!
You two can't even
take a shower
with a beautiful woman
without wearing
your jeans!
Ha ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha ha!
You!
Come here!
Now!
Grrr.
Yah!
Ha ha ha ha!
Aah!
Oh!
Haaa!
Prepare to die,
Wyatt.
I can't wait to die.
We're gonna kick...
ass.
Okay. This is war.
.
Leave the girls
out of this.
Ha ha ha ha!
I said hands off!.
!
Ah...ahh!
Hee hee hee hee!
Hee hee hee hee!
Why don't you
shut up, bitch?
And as for
your ugly ass,
with your faggot friends,
driving your motorbikes
all over his floors,
stinking up the place--
and you do stink.
You're going to
let go of the girls
and apologize
to all these people.
Get on your bikes.
Pedal your ugly asses
out of here.
Ha ha ha ha!
We're gentlemen,
so we'll give you a choice.
You can
leave in peace...
or you can stay and die.
Ugh!
The choice is yours.
Aaaahhhhh!
Get out of here.
Beg your pardon.
Your home is lovely.
.
Call me.
We'll have lunch.
Can we keep this
between us?
I'd hate to lose
my teaching job.
God bless you.
I can't believe it.
Is everyone all right?
We're heroes.
We showed
these guys down.
You and me saved
all these people.
This could mean
a guest shot
on .
This is exciting, man!
Where did you
get that thing?
It's a squirt gun.
Aah!
That's my boys.
What a weird night, huh?
You really weren't
afraid of those guys?
I was scared.
But what could I do?
I probably shouldn't
ask too many questions
about tonight.
Probably.
can I ask you
something strange?
Would you kiss me?
What about Ian?
We all make mistakes.
Okay.
Okay.
Where do you want it?
Can I ask you
a question?
Yeah.
How do you feel
about Lisa?
I love her.
That's what I figured.
But, uh...
it's definitely
a different
kind of love.
You know,
it's more sisterly,
like big sisters,
like, kind of.
But she's
so beautiful.
Yeah, she's
really beautiful.
And her body is...
it's gorgeous.
It's a nice figure.
So...
I mean,
what would I be
compared to her?
Deb, Lisa is everything
I ever wanted in a girl...
before I knew
what I wanted.
I'd make her
just like you.
Honest.
Dead honest.
I'm like... I'm really honest
when I say that.
I'm so very honest.
.
What the hell?
!
That little bastard.
If my room's okay,
I won't kill him.
I'll just hurt him
real bad.
Freeze.
Chet!
Where's my brother?
Ow.
Uh...
I don't know.
You're dead meat,
pilgrim.
Uh...
Chet, Chet,
that's her nose.
She has nothing
to do with it.
Okay. You die.
She walks out of here
with a severe limp.
I'll be back.
That's Wyatt's
older brother, Chet.
He's an asshole.
Oh, hi, Chet.
What the hell's
going on around here?
Chet, it was
an accident.
An accident?
Do you realize
it's snowing in my room,
goddamn it?
.
It doesn't
take a genius
to figure that out,
monkey dick.
Start talking.
Gary and I
made a woman
with the computer.
She went crazy and
messed up the house.
Don't smart-mouth me,
you shit!
Leave him alone.
This is a family
matter, bimbo.
Chet,just let me
find Lisa.
She'll clear
everything up.
You can have
my college money
and my social security,
Chet.
So you guys think
you can fool me, huh?
Huh?
You've synched everybody
to the same bullshit story.
This is
a Pershing missile, Chip.
My name is Chet.
And I didn't think
it was a whale's dick, honey.
Hi, Nanny.
Hi, Grampy.
I'm not a moron.
I...
Was that
my grandparents?
Are they dead?
No. They're
just resting.
What are they
doing in here?
.
.
catatonic in a closet?
Do you have any idea
how disrespectful that is?
I wouldn't give
a squirt of piss
for your ass right now.
.
.
Gary, take the Ferrari.
The Ferrari?
I want to be alone
with Chet.
Good to see you.
Get out of here!
Take your little
hussies home!
I want to get to
the bottom of this,
A.S.A.F.P.
Oh, so do I.
First, I'd like to
butter your muffin.
Why must you be
such a wanker?
Because
I get off on it.
I want you to
keep your big mouth shut
about everything
that's happened here.
Treat Wyatt and Gary
with dignity and respect.
Oh, really?
Yeah. Really.
I can be
a real serious bitch...
if I don't get
what I want.
Ooh. Hit me
with your best shot.
How fast
are you going?
About 3 5.
Wait.
This can't be right.
No. I'm looking at
about 50 tickets.
Bye!
This happens
every time!
Oh, my. Whew!
That was great!
You son of a bitch!
Al, Al!
Al, that was Gary!
Who is this
Gary character?
I had a great time
last night.
I'll probably
be grounded for
a month or so, but...
I'll wait for you.
Mmph!
Mmm.
Hilly!
I love you!
All right!
I want to thank you
for a great night.
Same here.
I have kind of
a confession to make.
I'm really
not this cool.
That's not my car.
This is not my suit.
Those people
weren't my friends.
Why are you telling me
all of this?
Because I want you
to like me
for what I am.
Whatever you are,
I like it.
Whew!
Well, I'd better
get going.
Wyatt and I still
have to deal with Chet.
Quit screwing around!
This isn't funny,
you stupid bitch!
Careful, Chet.
Don't make me angry.
Sorry.
That's better.
Turn me back
to normal.
I haven't done
anything to you.
You've done plenty
to your brother.
Like what?
You've nagged him,
harassed him...
Huh, me?
Supressed him,
extorted money from him.
It was done
out of love.
I should give you
a set of elephant balls.
Heeagghh!
Promise me you'll leave
Wyatt and Gary alone,
and I'll change you back.
Oh, all right.
Shake on it, huh?
No, thanks.
I'd rather not.
Wait!
Where are you going?
I have to
go and get changed.
What about me?
The effect
will wear off, okay?
Well?
I'm in love.
Isn't it great?
The best.
I'll tell you what.
Things are
turning around for us.
.
Okay, what about Lisa?
We'll have
a talk with her.
Think she'll understand?
I think so.
I sure as hell
wouldn't want
to date you.
You're not my type.
Chet?
Hi, dudes!
I'm sorry, Wyatt,
for being a shit to you
all these years.
And gee,
I want you to know that...
I love you.
Blech!
Ha ha ha ha!
That's nasty, Wyatt.
That's Chet, Gary.
Hey, hey.
Mmm.
Mmm!
Oh, my God!
In here.
Lisa.
You saw Chet?
Yes, I did.
Yes, I am.
Lisa, we can't
have him like that.
It'd ruin Christmas.
He'll be fine
in half an hour.
He won't
spoil Christmas.
.
Um, Lisa, we have to
have a talk with you.
What's on your mind?
I really don't know
how to say this.
You guys found
girlfriends, right?
.
.
That's all I ever
wanted for you.
You're not hurt?
Yeah, sure I'm hurt.
.
I'm really
just getting off
seeing you guys
straightened out.
I have to go.
Oh.
I've had
a wonderful time.
Lisa.
Bye.
Boys?
We're home!
Hi, Mr. Donnely.
How are you?
Hi, honey.
Dad, hi.
No, no, no.
Not much.
Hung around the house.
Daddy thought
you might throw a party
or do something nutty.
Not us.
Not here.
No way.
No way.
Shh, shh, shh.
.
Drop and give me 20.
