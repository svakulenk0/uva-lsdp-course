Dear Santa,
Are you real?
how come I can't see your house
when I look on Google Earth?
'Cause you'd be
incredibly old.
How do you have time
to read all the letters
And how many cookies and
mince pies have you eaten
How do you get
all of the presents in the sack?
every year, 'cause of
exponential population growth?
And how do you
get down the chimneys?
I put my head in ours,
and it's really small,
even if you could
squeeze down in 1 minute.
And there's 9 houses in my village,
so that's nearly 10 minutes,
and there are
millions of loads in the world.
It must be so hard
being Santa these days.
I mean, what if,
after all of that,
Santa, how can you get
'round the whole world
My friend said, that
you'd have to go so fast,
it would make you,
and the sleigh,
and the reindeer,
all burn up!
I would love a pink
twinkle-bike with stabilizers.
But, please, don't
bring it
if it makes you
and the reindeer burn.
Love,
Gwen Hines.
Thank you for
your letter and,
twinkle-bike will be
passed on to Santa.
and he can get around
the world to every child
without a single reindeer
being roasted alive, or hurt.
By the time the sun
comes up on Christmas day,
First field elf battalion set!
- Straighten that teddy bear, soldier.
- Now!
Ho, ho, ho.
And a ho, ho, ho, ha.
Field elves, jingle.
Jingle! Jingle!
Drop-time:  18.14 seconds
per household.
Left foot, sir.
- Right foot, sir. That's it.
- Oof.
Dog food incoming!
Mini-chunks in the hole!
This kid must've been
good his whole life!
Marvelous!
Hits me every time.
AWK! MERRY CHRISTMAS!
AWK! MERRY CHRISTMAS!
AWK! MERRY--
Carrot chomped.
Ahem?
Oh!
Sorry. Ha ha.
Drop complete.
Standby S-1.
- You'll never make it.
- Our goose is merry!
You have weather fluctuation.
Update camouflage.
- Denmark cleared.

Flensburg ready.
Press "E".
Converting milk and
cookies to biofuel.
Hello?
Oh! Ah!
- Sorry. Forgot PIN code.
Uh, we just crossed into Germany, sir.
Germany? Huh.
So many countries these days.
It's a big night, sir.
My, uh, 70th mission. Yes.
Oh, sorry.
One too many, uh,
mince pies.
So, you looking forward to it?
Retirement?
- Maintain.
Carry on.
Delete rice pudding
and carrot.
German "leave-out" for Santa is
shoe upon step.
Oy, soldier!
Get off your bum-bum!
What happened to peace
and goodwill to all men, Sarge?
It don't say nothing
about elves, soldier.
Go! Drop!
This is Germany, father.
Drive on the right.
National dish:  sausage.
OK. Let's show them, people!
Operation "Santa Claus
is Coming to Town".
- Drop complete!     - Drop Complete!
- Drop complete!     - Drop Complete!
- Wow!
- Hold the handrail.
And,uh, that's Grace Smith.
She wants an elephant.
What are you doing in here, Arthur?
I've got to get this letter
from Maria Costa down to Steve.
- Oh, no! Maria!
- Whoops. Bye-bye, Maria.
Is this yours, Arthur?
Thanks, Ken.
Merry Christmas!
You want a ride, Arthur?
No. Thanks.
I'm not very good
with heights and speed.
Buckle down, people!
Buckle down!
- Peter.
- Ready, sir.
SitRep on Special Forces.
Where are they?
America, sir. White House, sir.
Delivering to the
President's children, sir.
Okay, team.
Left out of the Oval Office,
right at the cabinet room,
second floor, by the air vents.
You think of everything, sir.
Thank you, Peter.
I'd love an espresso.
Coming right up!
Brother!
Merry Christmas!
- Ow!
- Mind the glasses.
Oh, you thought of everybody!
Sorry, can I just...um...
- ...no. Never mind.
- Ow!
Oh dear!
So sorry!
- ...6...B...
- Merry Christmas!
- ...0...I...C...
- And a happy new year!
Out with the old Santa,
- in with the new, eh?
- Well, I...
Let's focus on the now.
Eh, Peter?
Support teams,
prep Poland.
- Wow! Poland!
Do you know
what they call Dad here?
Święty Mikołaj!
- Anyway...
- I guess he's harmless.
- Whoa!
- Ow!      - Ow!
Oh, terribly sorry.
Is that your leg?
I'm sorry!
I'm really sorry, Steve.
It's my Christmas
slippers on the ice.
They're from China.
- Found it.
- What?
The letter. You know?
The one I said,
from Maria Costa.
She asked for a pocket puppy,
but she really wants the blue one,
'cause it looks like her
auntie's dog Biffo that ran away.
I remember, 'cause she
sent a picture of Biffo.
- See?
- Uh, child 3G7X...
- A...A...Arthur...
- This was Greece, sir!
Five countries ago, sir!
Oh. Um...
I just want it to be
perfect for every kid.
Hey! There's Dad!
Santa!
Maria Costa, Dad!
Did she get the blue one?
Little bro, it's great
to have you around.
You...You bring a...
a genuine aura...
...of seasonal positivity.
- Thank you.
- But could you...
...not be in Mission Control...
at all?
For the rest of the night.
Oh. Um...ah...
- ...Yeah.
Ah, of course.
Right.
Sorry if I...uh...
Brilliant!
They should put him
somewhere out of harm's way.
What? Like the South Pole?
Waker!
We have a waker!
And Santa's in there!
Santa?
Are you here?
-  Steve...
- Hold on, father.
Intel. Get me intel!
Santa's head seems to be
resting on some sort of
- "Try Me" button, sir.
It's the "Quack Quack
Moo Activity Farm", sir.
It features 12
separate animal sounds,
and sings
"Old MacDonald Had a Farm".
The moment your father lifts his head,
there'll be 10 seconds
of constant "moo"ing.
- Captain Moreno.
You're going to have
to take the batteries out.
But he'll have to get past
the wrapping, the box,
and 14 twist-ties
anchoring it to the cardboard.
- It's too noisy!
- And you'll wake the boy!
He'll see Santa!
And, at 1816,
when Santa was seen,
they tracked him home.
He had to go into hiding.
No Christmas for six years!
The elves!
All alone!
- The elves? Alone?
- What are we going to do?
Calm down!
It's not 1816 now.
Moreno, your HOHO
is equipped with
state of the art EMF
sensor technology
hacked directly from the
military's missile program.
I want you to locate the batteries
and perform a level 3
gift-wrap incision.
Go in through the robin.
Big girl's blouse.
Lot of fuss.
I did my 70 missions
without any of this malarkey!
Didn't we, lad?
Can I watch with you, Grand-Santa?
Shut the door!
Hell's ***,
- It's the North Pole!
- Is the kid still asleep?
He mustn't see Santa!
Dad would rather die
than spoil it for him.
What if you do
wake the old nipper?
A whack on the head
with a sock full of sand
and a dab of whiskey on the lips;
they don't remember
in the morning.
-
-
- Yes!
What happened to going
down the chimney?
Never did me any--
Get off me!
Down, boy!
Basket!
Here you are,
Grand-Santa.
I made you a
nice mince pie.
I can't eat that.
It gets in me teeth.
Oh, dear.
Now, I've just got to
visit the elf hospital,
look over a treaty with Greenland,
and make the gravy.
Then we'll finally have the
whole family home for Christmas.
They're nearly done.
-
- Oh, no!
-
- It's the detachable milkmaid!
They've got 5 seconds
'til she starts singing!
Use your HOHO!
Exit Code 12.
Code 12!
OLD MACDONALD HAD A FARM.
OK! Go! Go! Go!
Revise drop-time to
Let's pick this up, people!
-
- Hey!
Oh, what a night that was!
Just the beginning.
Right, sir?
I...got you a present, sir.
Not "S" for Steve, sir.
"S" for Santa!
Oh...I don't know about that, Peter.
Okay! Let's bring them home!
CCTV in every room!
I had to go under the floor!
Stand back!
Olly Injury coming through!
Hey! Fancy a trip
on the S-1, Arthur?
It only goes 150,000
miles per hour.
No, thanks. I see a bit of the
world from my office, you know.
Some of the stamps I get are amazing!
Excuse me!
Santa!
Dad! Dad!
Dad!
Oops. I'm sorry. So sorry.
- Dad! Dad!
- Santa's waving!
- He's waving at me!
- He's waving at me!
- Arthur.
- Happy Christmas!
You, too.
You were fantastic!
Look:  Christmas slippers!
Huh. Well done. Yes.
- Father?
- Ah! There he is!
Steve!
Mission:  Accomplished!
Tonight, we delivered
on this, my 70th mission!
Standby!
Oh, thank you.
You know, I sometimes think
I couldn't do it without you,
and my splendid Margaret,
who stood by me
all these years,
very ably doing all that, uh,
stuff that women do when
their husbands are at work.  Marvelous.
And, uh, Arthur. Yes.
Doing vital work in maintenance.
- Really vital.
- I, um,
I work in letters, Dad.
Letters. Of course.
I'm so sorry.
You moved me after
I tripped over that plug
and melted down the elf barracks.
Yes. Now...
Many years ago,
my father told me,
that being Santa
is the best job in the world.
He was right.
I loved it.
I can't wait for year seventy one!
Merry Christmas everyone!
What do you get
if you eat
Christmas decorations?
Tinsel-itis!
Isn't this the best
bit of Christmas?
It certainly is, Arthur.
The whole family together.
- How about a toast, Malcolm?
- Oh!
Uh, well ... here's to me ...
doing an even better job next year!
I mean, you're
already perfect, Dad.
Ha! That turkey did more than him.
Ha! Ha! H--
You wouldn't understand, Father.
I'd rather move
things on since your day.
Eh, Steve?
Forget Techno Tommy.
He's texting on his
calculator after another job.
It's a rganizer:
the HOHO 3000.
- I'm enacting mission closure.
- Ooo. Whoopie doo.
Aren't you the Fancy Nancy?
Don't matter what
you come up with, son.
You may be the next in line,
but you'll never get to be
Santa unless you knock him off.
Um...
I've got you all a present.
After all the hard work,
I wanted everyone
to have some Christmas fun.
Ta-da!
What is that?
- I'm Santa!
- No. I'm Santa.
This is ridiculous. You just took
the piece out of my hand!
Well, I am actually Santa,
so I rather think I should have it.
Well, yes. You're the
non-executive figurehead.
Exactly. The figurehead.
It means a fatty with a
beard and fits the suit.
The other pieces are good, too.
Or, I can make
extra Santa's for everyone.
Why don't you
be the candle, Steve?
All those bright ideas, eh?
Fine.  I'm the candle.
Arthur's the turkey.  And you,
Father, are, of course,
Santa.
Grand-Santa, you can be
this charming relic.
Relic? Relic?
I did the whole of
Christmas in one of these, Arthur!
Oh, yes. I didn't need a
trillion elves in blinking hats.
We don't just fly about throwing
lead-painted toys down chimneys any more.
- That space sends you back to Lapland.
- Why?
Malcolm, where did you get those?
Just moving things along.
- Do I win?
- Cheats! The pair of you!
- Mum, are you okay?
- Polar bear, dear.
Attacked me on the ice.
Good job I did
that online survival course,
or it would be
one less for turkey next year.
Christmas has gone
right down the Rodney hole.
You're a postman with a spaceship!
My S-1 festivized the world
at 1,860 times the speed of sound!
Christmas, 1941.
World War II.
I did the whole thing with
six reindeer and a drunken elf!
I was shot at, Arthur.
Took twelve direct hits.
- Lost three reindeer.
- What happened to the elf?
Fell out of the sleigh over
Lake Geneva.  Never saw him again.
Goodness.  Now,
Christmas crackers.
Sing "Silent Night" backwards.
Who would know that?
tneliS thgin! yloH thgin!
llA si mlac, lla si thgirb.
I went on alone.
I could still do it now, Arthur.
- Just gimme a go!
- In a heap of sticks.
Heap of--
I'll show you,
Rumpy the robot!
- Oh, dear.
- Oh, my. That won't make--
- I would've won, anyway.
- What?
Oh, yeah! Run away,
now that you're losing!
Steve!
Steve! Don't be upset.
Look:  You keep this.
Then you can be Santa next time.
That'll be you there, Steve.
Next year, I bet.
You'll be great.
How many times, Arthur?
It's the North Pole.
Shut the doors!
I secured the gift, sir.
Gift secured.
It just can't be.
The system is foolproof.
- It has to be an error, sir.
- Error!?
I spotted the ribbon
glinting in the shadows, sir.
I am actually trained in wrapping.
But I say to myself, "Bryony,"
the wrapping looks okay.
Thank goodness!
- But that present should not be lying in the--
- Yes. Yes. Thank you, soldier.
Someone got the wrong present?
That's awful!
- Whose is it?
- No one gets the wrong present.
Gift undelivered?!
They got ... nothing.
-
- A child's been missed.
Not necessarily.
A child's been missed!
Do you want to wake up
the whole North Pole?
Good idea.
A CHILD'S BEEN MISSED!!!!
Arthur!
Everything all right?
There's been ...
a glitch.
- We've missed a child!
- Really?
Dear, oh dear.
That's awful.
How did you let it happen, Steven?
How did I--
- I thought it was your mission.
- Oh, no, no.
- This is your department.
- What are we going to do?
We must...um...
We must...
What must we do, Steven?
There's...nothing to do.
The mission was a success.
We can't leave
a child out of Christmas.
Sunrise at destination is 7:39 A.M.
- There's no way to get there in time.
- No way.
- Except, of course, the S-1.
- The S-1.
- Righto.
- No!
The S-1 has just traveled
- We could damage it!
- Oh, dear.
- And, risk the lives of the elves.
- Oh, dear.
I'll go, sir.
Bryony Shelfley, Wrapping
Division. Grade Three, sir!
- Who asked you?
- I wasn't called up for field duty this year,
Served up my mission
in gift-wrap support.
I wrapped
If you want that bike delivered
in a perfect state of enwrapment,
- then I'm your elf.
- No one is going!
- It's impossible!
- But, this child!
It's a margin of error of
Wow.
I mean, "Hello??"
Where's the champagne?
My department has
delivered the most
outstanding Christmas ever.
Oh.  Uh...
Well done, us.
But, there's a child
without a present.
Arthur, Christmas is not
a time for emotion.
We will get 47785BXK a present
within...the window of Christmas.
We'll messenger the item.
It'll be there in 5 days.
But, that'll ruin the magic.
If there was any way at all
to make the drop tonight;
it can't be done.
Your brother knows
about these things.
I won't sleep easy after this, Arthur.
But there it is.
It can't be done.
Merry Christmas.
Arthur,
you're compromising
the wrapping!
That is not a toy!
Well, it is, but that's not the--
ARTHUR!
C'mon, C'mon, C'mon, C'mon.
Child 47785BXK...
Where are you?
Ah!
Dear Santa,
and my friend doesn't believe in you.
For Christmas, I'd like
a pink twinkle-bike.
Gwen Hines.
Trelew, Cornwall, England.
This figurehead thing.
I'm not just a
fatty with a suit, am I?
Of course not, dear.
No.  I'm Santa.
Children...
rely on me.
- Here.
- Thank you.
It's just cheques for the boys
and cash for Father.
Oh, Malcolm.
The 2 billion other gifts, dear.
Christmas has become
such a mad rush!
Until you...retire....
Retire?
Sit next to Father,
watching Steve on TV.
You are sent a level 1 access HOHO.
Please state your identity.
Who would I be?
You'd be my Malcolm, dear.
And there's...Arthur.
Dear Arthur.
What a puzzle.
- This one's from me, dear.
- Oh.
Happy Christmas, Margaret.
Oh, thank you.
I'm still very much
after the two of you, now.
Ho-ho--
Night, dear.
Good night,
Malcolm.
It just can't be.
It can't.
It just can't be. It can't.
It just CAN'T--
What's all this
caboodle, young man?
Grand-Santa!
It's this little girl.
- She's been missed.
- Ha!
So much for your brother's
fancy-pants technology.
No! Steve and Dad
wracked their brains,
- but they said it's impossible.
- Is it, now?
Missed a child.
Dear, oh, dear.
Sends shivers down me shins.
In 2 hours,
she's gonna wake up,
head downstairs,
search under the tree, and
the look on her face...
when there's nothing there.
She won't understand.
She'll think she's the
one kid in the whole world
that Santa doesn't care about.
She'll feel so...
left out.
On Christmas night,
he comes.
Gwen can't not have
a present from Santa.
Do you know, Arthur,
there is a way.
It's impossible.
They used to say
it was impossible
to teach women to read.
Follow me.
It's--
It's the actual sleigh!
Hello, Evie.
I though it was
scrapped years ago.
So did everyone else.
I know.
Icelandic birch.
Arctic balsa.
Built in 1845.
Able to reach
at a height of 40,000 feet!
- With a--
- Over here, you sprig of tinsel!
Potash of Carboniloroxy Amilocitrate...
Magic dust!
Mined from the aurora borealis.
She doesn't still...
go?
Not just a hobby, Arthur.
Great-great grandchildren
of the original 8.
Dasher!
Wow!
Dancer!
Prancer!
Uh, what are the others called?
I could never ruddy remember.
B-Bambi?
-John!
You there,
with the white ear.
And you.
Not you, you bag of fleas.
Uh...
Ah!
- I'm not really good with big animals!
- Piffle!
Don't get bit-mind.
They can smell fear.
Let's hitch 'em up!
Grand-Santa!
Ah, excuse me.
You can go to Gwen,
on the old sleigh,
with the reindeer,
and the magic dust,
and everything!
It's a miracle!
You're coming too, lad.
Me? On that?
Up there?
Pulled by them?
Ah!
N-no way.
I'm 136. I can't do it
on me own. I need an elf.
I can't fly a sleigh!
I can't even ride
a bike without stabilizers.
I know! Let's
wake Steve. He'll--
No!
He's a worrier, Arthur.
What if he stops us?
Gwen's forgotten.
You really care.
Well, of course I do!
I was Santa, too.
Think of your dad.
Lying awake,
chewing his
beard off with
worry over this girl.
Don't you want
to help, for once?
Make him proud?
I can't.
I just...
I...
No! I can't.
Ready?
No!
Ha Ha!
You promised not to go too fast!
I get travel sick,
and I'm allergic to snow!
Ho ho!
So you're a son of Santa?
Wait! My slippers!
They're not **!
Dash! Dash!
DAAAASSSHHH!!!
Ha! Ha! Ha!
See? Who's Santa now?
Ho-ho-ho!
Whoooo!
Aah! Put me down!
- What's the matter, boy?
- I'm having a heart attack!
- Ha! Ha!Ha!
- Ga...
They've never flown before.
Just gotta break them in.
Now:
Come away!
Dash away!
Look, Arthur:
All those stars!
We're one of them, now.
A shooting star!
Stuck that there for
your dad when he was a boy.
Dad? He sat here?
So did I.
Every young heir to the Pole
gets took out by his father.
Right back to Saint Nick.
We Clauses used to be
the only men in the world
who could fly, Arthur.
See all this?
It was a gift.
Great big ball wrapped in
oceans and mountains.
I remember the look on your
father's face when he saw it.
Fish!
- With horns!
- Ha, ha!
Want to help me
make a snowman?
Ah! Where's the seatbelt?
Whoa!
Woo hoo!
Can Dad do that?
Did he make
a snowman for Steve?
Robot Roy? Ha!
Ice and cocoa.
Next Santa, and he's
never even sat in a sleigh.
- Is that...?
- The map of the Clauses.
Used every
Christmas night in history.
Whatever your brother says, Arthur,
it's the same old world.
Whaaaaaaaa!
- What is it?
- No idea! I've never seen it before!
- It's a city!
- New one erected.
They're always putting these things up.
I remember the first time
I ran into Chicago.
Chicago wasn't on the map?
Now then,
where are we?
Aha! Here we are. See?
Oho! No, that's Peking.
- Um...Ahead, there's a--
- Whoa!
They can see us!
Well, pull the camouflage lever!
Now, then. We'd better draw in
a few of these sky-scratchers. Just...
Well, that's a steam train, you ninny!
So, what do they call this place?
To-ron-to.
- Toronto's in Canada!
- The Santa's always come through Canada.
Nobody lives here.
It's nice and quiet.
'Til your brother came
along, with all his,
"You can't cut through
Saigon. There's a war." rubbish.
I don't need him to tell me
what's ahead. I've got eyes.
Grand-Santa!!
Ah! It's an elf!
Bryony Shelfley. Ow!
This is more stronger
than your gift wrap, sir,
- but I can fix it.
- A stowaway.
I can wrap anything, sir,
with three bits
of sticky tape. Three.
Good.
Wrap yourself a parachute.
Grand-Santa!
Ah!
Toronto.
- Present and correct.
- Not quite, sir.
You've lost one of the reindeer!
Quantitative easing...
What the...? Hello?
- What elf?
The crazy wrapping elf,
you know?
Security tracked her
to sector 9-G, and...
- Arthur?
Who else leaves
the door open, huh, sir?
The old sleigh barn?
That was sealed up decades ago!
After that terrible night,
Grand-Santa sneaked out and...
Thank goodness he's
too old these days
to get into trouble.
Bash it with a brick, Arthur!
Go on!
Grab its antlers and tug.
I may just be
a wrapping operative, sir,
but this contravenes...
specific mission regulations!
I'm in charge here,
not Billy the bureaucrat.
Tug!
Wrap your head.
Come on, lad!
You're as much use
as a cheese chopstick!
Got it!
Oh.
Oh, my big Aunt Betty...
It'll have to do.
Pass it down!
What?
Permission to breathe, sir.
I have about 9 seconds
left before I black out.
One breath.
- Sir?
- I said, "One."
Hurry up, Arthur.
Don't we need a whole one?
You know, to balance the sleigh?
Oh, it won't balance
the sleigh. No. No.
If anything,
it'll slow us down.
So, why are we taking it?
It's for Gwen.
Eight beautiful reindeer.
That's what she's dreaming of.
The jingly bells,
the sleigh on the roof.
- Yeah, but...
- That's what the kids want,
not some spaceship!
We're giving her the star treatment.
What now?
We have a waker, sir.
With a gun!
That's it, lad.
You distract it!
- Grand-Santa!
- Who's there?
Uh--
We come in peace.
Our craft has to travel
around the world
in less than an hour!
We need the sign
for our slei--
craft.
Sorry I can't pay you.
Where I come from,
we don't have moneyyyy--
Christmas, 1923:
Had a heart attack at the reins.
Left ventricle
popped out me mouth.
Pushed it back down
and carried on.
Ha, ha.
Big, isn't it?
The Atlantic.
You think we should
stop and ask someone?
Pishy whipper!
We're nearly there!
See? I take the
North Star there
as a fixed point,
then I plot my bearings from--
That's a plane, sir.
Insubordination!
I'll have you harpooned, elf.
I thought it would be
chillier near England.
Uh...globular warming.
Ha! Land ahoy!
There it is!
Told you.
Now, now.
There you go.
Wow!
England.
Maybe we've come
to the right a bit.
We're a reindeer short.
France.
They have elephants in France?
The odd stray.
They breed in the drains.
This way.
Paris zoo.
Then this is where
they keep the lions!
They won't eat me.
I'm Santa!
Lie down!
Right.
- Call the keeper!
- How old is this?
Atlantis?
Here be cannibals?
You gotta watch out for cannibals.
This isn't France, is it?
Technically, it's North Africa.
Ah!
Serengeti National Park,
Tanzania.
Rubbish. How can
you possibly be sure?
The GPS in the HOHO, sir.
Take her!
Take the elf!
GPS?
Why didn't you say?
I'm a wrapping elf.
I don't navigate.
I wrap! I use it
to draw pictures of bows.
She's right. You've
brought us to Africa!
I've seen it on a stamp.
I'm too young
to die, Arthur!
Do something!
Arthur!!!!!!
The old sleigh?
What is happening here?
It was supposed to be chopped
up for firewood decades ago!
- Who on Earth would be that devious?
- Old people, sir.
Shall I get you
your stress ball?
We have a finer
comms array than the Pentagon,
and you say we
can't contact him
except by some crazy, ancient--
- Ernie Clicker, sir.
Whole of communications
for 46 missions.
Me and your granddad
saw some time.
- I remember, once--
- Wow. Must catch up soon. Now...
Ooh, you're in a hurry.
I can tell.
Oh, this is ridiculous.
Can't we hurry this?
Ooh, you can't rush
the Stigdamater.
Got to play her gentle.
So, what do you
wish to say?
I wouldn't worry.
It's not like they're
facing man-eating lions.
Silent night
H-holy night
All is calm-- AAH!
All is bright
I realize this is mental
but it's all that I know
It's Christmas, nice kitty,
so please, let us go
Sleep in heavenly peace
-
- AAAAhhhh!!!!
Whoa!
Dad!
- Oh! Something's coming through!
- What does it say?
ROAR...GRRR....
Get off her!
That's me Evie,
you mangy moron!
No!
That's Gwen's gift!
Only children get
to tear the wrapping!
- Bryony?!
- Automatic tape gun!
Bad doggy!
Bad doggy!
Laser-guided scissors!
Oh, no!
Not the...
Standard-issue gift-wrap!
There's no time for a bow!
There's always time for a bow!
Not that knob!
- Oh! Good night!
- Oh, no!
- Uhhh...
- Something else!
No! Leave it alone!
My camera!
Wait!
Look!
- Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
- Wow!
- Whoa!
- What's so funny?
Look what
they've done to my Evie!
And the map!
But, it's okay!
We've got this! Look:
Mimosa Avenue, Trelew.
Proceed to the
highlighted route.
What's the point?
Look at us.
And my camera totally bad-jacked.
- How do I get my picture now?
- What picture?
The sleigh on the roof,
the eight beautiful reindeer,
and Santa--me--
going down the chimney!
That's what I
wanted them to see.
They missed the kid,
but I got there.
My way.
That's why you came.
Not for Gwen.
1,368 miles,
then, slight left.
For the love of Lulu,
bossed about
by Tim TomTom.
Try them again.
Keep trying!
All this about 1 child...
in 600 million!
We can turn their **.
Don't worry, sir.
Children are stupid.
Either he won't know
he got missed,
or he'll think he's been bad!
It's a win-win!
You missed one?
A nipper?
What's all this here for,
if you've missed one?
Would you please
type faster?
Systems critical.
Lead in Christmas.
Oopsy-daisy.
Peter?
Let go of my hand, please.
Yes, sir.
Sorry, sir.
And get me IT.
Whoo-hoo! We did it!
Woopty-doo.
In 100 yards,
turn left.
Straight ahead.
Turn right. Left again.
Steady!
We made it.
I survived!
I'll walk home,
I'll get a boat,
but I am never getting back
in that crazy flying death-trap ever again!
Go on.
Get it over.
I want my bed.
You're not coming?
You have to deliver the present!
You put your
special coat on.
You're our Santa!
I said, me and Evie
could get here and we did.
The rest is just elf work.
Go on , Festive Freddy,
sling your hook.
It doesn't matter
how we got here.
The sleigh on the roof,
the jingle bells;
the eight reindeer.
Gwen would never
have seen that.
I wish Dad could see this.
It would take
such a load off his mind.
So,
what are your orders?
You're a Claus.
You give the orders.
Yeah! Oh, um...
I'm just happy being an elf, really.
You know,
just part of it all.
You want the orderly
to go through the cat flap?
Oh, yes.
That's a grand idea.
Do you want
the girl to let you in?
Brilliant!
Thank you, Bryony.
And do you want...
Wait!
Uh, the alarm?
Yes! Definitely!
Is this your first time?
Bryony?
He loves these slippers
even more than you do!
Merry Christmas.
When you put
the address into the HOHO,
- what did you see?
- A list of Trelews.
I just clicked on the first one.
Which was not Trelew, England!
We're in the wrong Trelew!
They've been watching us.
They've seen Evie!
It's just like last time!
Governments tonight
are waking to news of a UFO
traveling around the globe
at incredible speed.
Ha, ha!
The clear sighting was at
this tractor dealership in Idaho.
...and eyeballs on its feet,
and a pointy little head.
- We're on the news!
And from the trail
left in Toronto,
these beings do not
appear to be friendly.
We are online, sir.
** police found
a little furry thing
which tried to mate
with a dog.
Paul, I have calls reporting a
steam train flying around downtown.
- What do you see on satellite?
- It's gone black over Mexico.
This thing is going faster
than anything we know of.
The herd is now
in Mozambique's airspace,
Two billion items delivered,
and we didn't leave
a footprint in the snow. And now?
Sir, we have lost
No! No! We have 18 pulse data
reservoirs of a trillion terabytes!
Sorry.
Auto-save was off.
Shall I sock it, sir?
Quite hard?
Sir, there's a polar bear on level 6.
Sir, why is Arthur out there?
He missed one.
A nipper.
I mean:  47785BXK.
Sir, we've got something.
Bryony Shelfley.
It's her HOHO.
We can still get there.
We just have
to go faster. Higher.
You changed your tune.
I'm not going anywhere!
I'm not here!
- I taped myself in, Grand-Santa!
- Leave me alone!
- It's that terrible night, all over again!
- What night?
Last time I
took Evie for a spin,
I didn't know
it was the Cuban Missile crisis!
I nearly started World War III.
Someone has to drive!
Oh, no! Fencer!
Mincer! Come back!
- Bryony!
- Hi-ya!
Grand-Santa, get here!
Oy, that's me new hip!
Please!
I'll read you Gwen's letter.
Stone-deaf. I'm 136.
- What's that?
- It's Steve!
- Steve!
- Tell him I'm not here!
Grand-Santa says he's not here.
- Is the first one help?
- Yes! You can help us, Steve!
- It was him!
Trusty the Madman!
He forced me to come!
Elf, back me up
if you want a career.
- I forced you?
- You see? Look--
What do you want, Grand-Santa?
Let me guess.
Hmm. A picture of you,
in the sleigh,
delivering the gift,
to show me how it's really done?
- Do you know the picture they'll have tomorrow?
You led away in handcuffs.
The Santa who was seen.
By everybody on Earth.
We'll be back home
in the whup of a reindeer's buttocks.
- Gwen.
For that,
you'd threaten my whole operation?
Steve, you said
if there was any way
to get there, you would.
Well, this is it!
Look:
The old sleigh's perfect!
Ah, right. Well, anyway,
it goes really fast,
and we've got
quite a few reindeer left,
and, if I'm sick again,
I can be sick in a bag!
- We can help them, sir.
- "No one missed", sir.
"All correct presents,
present and correct," sir!
If you help us, Steve,
we can do it.
Grand-Santa and Arthur
would be the heroes of the night, sir!
Come home, now!
If we all just
gave in to Christmas spirit,
there'd be chaos!
- We're on our way, Steve.
- No!
Arthur...
This is Dad
we're talking about.
There was a time
when he cared about every last gift tag,
but now,
he just wants to be loved.
Get some rest.
Please, do not disturb
until December 26.
- Is that it, dear?
- Yes, Malcom! Press 3.
Santa's the most
caring man in the world.
So, why are you here,
not him?
Aaahhh!!!!
Don't leave me, Arthur.
Poor old man
and his reindeer,
on our own at Christmas.
At least have the decency
to finish us off with a rock!
Poor Evie.
Sun will be up soon.
It's Christmas!
Christmas is for kids.
You grow out of it.
What,
in the last six minutes?
I know what you
all say about me, you know.
"He belongs in the South Pole."
"Poor Arthur."
"What a puzzle."
Well, you were right.
All that fuss over one kid.
Well, you were right.
All that fuss over one kid.
I must be ridiculous!
This is nice.
Good to get
away from it all, you know.
All the Christmas fuss.
I'm sorry I've messed things up, lad.
You see,
the night I last took Evie out,
when there was all that....fuss,
your father came to me.
I'll never forget it;
couldn't look me in the eye.
"Dad," he says,
"Steve thinks it best
you don't fly again."
"We're scrapping the sleigh."
Me only son,
who used to sit where you sit,
looking up at me.
I just wanted them to remember
who I used to be.
I was a bit like you, lad.
Keen as cranberry.
So was your dad.
You get old.
That's all.
Everything...changes.
Does it?
How can I ever write
another letter
saying that Santa cares?
Good night, Dad.
Sleep well.
Sir, we know
you shouldn't believe rumors,
but we do.
Is it true you missed a child?
Me? No, no.
Well, in a way, yes.
It was just one.
In fact,
not even that.
Naught point,
lots more naughts,
then a number,
and some sort
of percent at the end.
Not really an error.
Just a one.
One child doesn't matter?
- Which one?
- Well, I...
Well, I did nice ones in **,
does those ones matter?
What about my ones in Germany?
- One of them was twins!
- They don't matter. **
Why don't you ask Steve?
He can explain.
- Fiendishly clever.
- But, aren't you in charge, sir?
Of course.
I'm Santa.
Sir, if the one that
got missed doesn't matter,
why have Arthur and
Grand-Santa gone to take it?
- What? Oh...
- Malcolm,
What's this about Arthur?
It's the religious children
who don't matter.
Santa says they don't matter 100%.
Is it true? Children aren't real?
They're just anti-matter?
Ssh! No! No! Look,
I festivized every single
country in the world!
You see? This one. This one.
This one. All of them!
I mean, who cares about
one single tiny child?
Uh...I do.
Oh, Arthur.
My poor boy!
Why on Earth would he...
Well, you're his brother, Steve.
How could you let him?
And, um, about
this child you missed,
I'm really not sure
you made the right decision.
Is that bird poo on your shoulder?
Right. Over there,
is satellite tracking.
Navigation.
Data analysis.
Copy machine's by the door.
Good night... Santa.
Glorious in excelsis
Um...
I'll be right back.
Thanks for your letter,
and drawing of Santa
tripping over your dog.
It was hilarious!
Dear Alessandro,
Sorry your family's had a hard year,
Dear Lois,
I promise,
- Can I burn this?
- Sure.
There's millions like it.
Pathetic!
This picture...
This...This drawing--
It isn't of Dad!
Or you...
Or Steve...
This is Santa!
Ha, ha! And as long
as we get the bike
to Gwen
before she wakes up,
then Santa came!
And he cares!
Ha, ha!
Ha, ha ha!
- Aah!
-  Jingle bells, Jingle bells,
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to reach
Gwen Hines on Christmas day. Hey!
Jingle bells
This boat smells
3000 miles to go
Oh, dear.
I've seen this before.
Sleigh fever,
they call it.
Pressure of Christmas
sends a man doolally tap.
Santa Claus the 16th
got it 1802.
Every child that year
got a sausage
nailed to a piece of bark.
Arthur!
Do you really think
you can row the
Atlantic Ocean in the next...
It's not too late, yet!
Just... have to keep... going.
We need
a blunt instrument.
Knock him out and regroup.
Make a legal U-turn,
then slight right,
You do know we're
going around in circles?
You know, we're
not the only ones
Maybe I will
see Evie again!
What do you mean?
Reindeer are
brave, powerful beasts,
but they're also
dappled cretins
with twigs on their heads.
They'll just keep going
in a straight line,
right around the world!
They'll be
way up in the sky,
flying at unimaginable speed,
but they'll pass
right over our heads!
Great! We CAN
get the sleigh back!
Chief De Silva.
So, where is this UFO?
It's circling the Earth, ma'am.
it went into orbit.
You?
Up there?
Catch that
with this?
Magic dust!
You crack it over your head.
You'll have to focus.
The sleigh will be coming at you
at 45,000 miles an hour.
- 45,000?
- You'll be torn in half!
Depends on the angle
the sleigh hits.
You might just get beheaded.
I've got a phobia of
being beheaded, and heights!
And speed,
and reindeer,
and... the buttons.
- Buttons?
- Yeah. I'm pretty much scared of everything.
Gwen thinks you're coming.
You can't do this.
Yes, you can!
No, you can't.
Yes, you can. COME ON, ARTHUR!
Don't worry, son.
Only a raving lunatic--
I have to worry!
It's the only thing I'm good at!
- Worry me.
- The sleigh will be back any minute!
Come on!
Worry me! Quickly!
Imagine Gwen,
all alone.
- nothing under the tree...
Here we go!
Aaahh! I don't
like this! Stop!
- Stop! Get me down!
- Tears, as she finds she's been left out!
Screaming "Santa didn't come!"
Oh, Gwen...
Aaaaahhhhoho!
It's just too high!
Gwen, in the street,
surrounded by kids on new bikes,
pointing,
"That's the girl that Santa hates!"
- No!
- She runs away.
Alcoholic by the age of 9.
Dead before she
gave birth--
She may never
build a snowman again!
What if there are buttons
on the sleigh I don't know about?
Here they come!
Eep!
Um...
Yaaaaaahhhhhh!!!
How do you
think he's, uh...
Fine. Fine.
Probably just, uh...
Ah! Ah! Ah!
Waaaaahhhhh!
So, how come you
didn't scrap the sleigh, sir?
I threatened the elves.
Said I'd feed 'em
to the polar bears.
Elf, how do you fancy
being the one to
tell his parents about all this?
Yaaaahhh!
Whoa!
Whoa! Whoa!
Yaaay! Arthur,
you did it!
I did it with worry!
I'm sure you're dying with fear!
Proceed to the
highlighted route.
Just keep
worrying about Gwen!
I'll find a way there, boy,
whatever it takes!
To Trelewwww!
Margaret,
Hand me my "me" suit.
All sorted.
Steve's...uh....
holding the fort,
while I deliver the present.
Yes.
And find Arthur a father.
Well done, dear.
Trelew's on a course
for 187.7 degrees
from the geographic pole,
but as it's the old sleigh,
we should allow a drift margin
of 1,000 miles outside the Greenwich meridian.
I put a sweater for Arthur,
your father's pills,
and some nice, sweet tea.
- Sir!
"Popped out to take present"
"Turkey sandwich in fridge.
Mom and Dad"
Idiot Arthur!
Send everyone crazy!
He'll destroy Christmas!
And you'll never
get to be Santa!
Steven!
I, um...
- Trelew.
- Oof!
Really, Malcolm, there's
no harm in using a manual. Men...
Margaret, I order you to disembark.
It's not safe.
Piffle. I did a bite of
light-flying course on the Internet.
It can't be that different.
Oh. Steve.
You dented it!
You take it out
without asking!
Malcolm! You
told me he knew!
You know how Steve
feels about his S-1.
My S-1!
"S" for Santa!
I'm flying to this child!
She's all that matters!
Not me, your son!
Not the 2 billion things
I did right tonight! No.
This is about that
pool table, isn't it?
I told you,
you should have written to me.
I was eight!
- You're my dad!
- For goodness' sake!
Arthur and Grand-Santa
are out there
probably not wearing
nearly enough layers,
and you two are
bickering over a big, red toy!
I... I'm not bickering.
If Steven could
just stand back-- OOF!
You drive, Steven.
Thank you.
So, since gift delivery to
child 47785BXK is all that seems to matter,
I'll do it myself.
Then we'll pick up
Arthur and Grand-Santa
from whatever ditch
they've ended up in.
Um... when Santa said he'd be right back...
what do you think he'd, um--
He's not coming back!
The Santas are leaving!
The children don't matter?
- Christmas doesn't matter!
- Nothing, man!
It's like 1816!
- Abandon the North Pole!
- Everybody panic!
Are you sure
you want to delete Christmas?
I know where
we can find a map, lad.
It's a bit risky, this.
Breaking the rules,
even in the old days!
There:
Biggest map in the world!
Dash!
Friends,
on this night of peace,
we stand confronted
by an unknown danger:
aliens.
Aliens from space.
What talk about?
Maybe the aliens come in peace?
They burst an inflatable Santa Claus
in Toronto, on Christmas night!
Let us attempt contact,
but be ready
to save our planet!
Hold tight, lad!
This is where
it gets really rough.
Not now,
you sack of antlers!
- Yay!
- Woo-hoo!
Coming down through
the atmosphere, ma'am.
- We'll see it any minute.
- 46...
They'll be waiting for us, sir.
We were on the news!
All their technology,
against my Evie!
Well, come on!
Let's do it with worry!
Santa mustn't be seen,
eh, lad?
Let's give them
something to shoot at!
We have visual.
Here it comes!
Take us to your leader!
Ha, ha!
England!
No sign of anyone.
- The sun's coming up!
- Come on, lad!
You can do it!
Mankind greets you.
Do you copy?
Season's greetings
from mankind.
Good morning.
Do you copy?
The hull is some kind of
woody substance, ma'am.
Like... wood.
Coated in lead paint!
- Yes, it seems to be alive.
- And furry!
Come on, lad.
Put your back into it!
Dashing through the snow
On a one-horse open sleigh
Over the fields we go
Laughing all the way
Ha! Ha! Ha!
I have something.
It's very faint, but--
Scramble drone.
...bells, Jingle bells
Jingle all the--
- That's it, there!
- Oh!
- We made it!
- Yay!
Not quite! Dash!
It runs off a steam **.
It's tracking something electronic!
We haven't got any elec-trickery!
Just wood and brass!
Oh, dear!
Your slipper!
We have lock.
We've got to
get you down there, lad!
They'll see us!
We'll be stopped!
- Give me that!
- What are you doing?
It's Evie they're after.
She doesn't fit
this world, Arthur.
She's a relic.
Evie?
I always knew she'd
be needed one more time.
You go on.
- We'll let them have her.
- You're coming, too?
You were right, Arthur.
It doesn't matter how
Santa's gift gets there.
Doesn't even matter
if it's Mr. Postman in his spaceship.
As long as it gets there.
You made it happen, lad.
No one got left out.
Get 'er off.
Now, do as I say!
They're firing on us!
- A death ray,
- made of chocolate and...
- oranges.
Unidentified varnished object,
- turn back, or we will shoot.
- Go!
Turn back.
Happy Christmas!
In Santa we believe!
Go on, elf.
You, too.
Hi-ya!
This is it, old fella.
Maybe the next Santa
never sat in my Evie,
but Arthur did,
and he's as good a man
as any Santa there's ever been.
Goodbye, Evie.
Thank you, everyone.
You've just saved Christmas.
Aaaah!
Out with the old,
in with the new.
Well done, dear.
Poor Arthur.
He tried so hard.
- He's flunked again.
- Of course he hasn't, dear.
We're here. The little
girl will get her present.
I think he's done
rather splendidly.
My Margaret...
Good morning, Gwen.
Ho, ho, etc.
Apologies for the minor delay.
I'm sure that even a child
can understand that in an
operation as complex as Christmas,
there's always an
insignificant margin of error.
Which is you.
As a gesture,
I've upgraded you to the
Glamafast Ultra X-3,
which retails at
Bigger, ergo better.
If you'll mind
just signing a legal waiver.
Pedro?
A boy?
A Spanish boy.
This is an error.
-
- Will you...
No, no no.
Please don't cry. No cry-o.
It's over a mile!
We've got no sleigh,
no reindeer,
and you can't even walk!
What are you doing?
I can cycle.
Hey! Come back!
What about the wrapping?!
Church!
She lives by the church!
Happy Christmas comes!
What the...?
Look, everyone!
It's Arthur!
He's delivering
the present!
- It's Arthur!
- Arthur!
Come back!
Oh, my head.
Yeebobo,
the beautiful young reindeer.
Ah.
So, who am I, then?
Gah! Okay, so,
I'm not great with children.
Does that make me a bad Santa?
You're hardly perfect.
Let me guess:
You put in the address,
you saw a list of Trelews,
and just clicked
on the first one?
You're just like Arthur!
- Am I?
-
Sir, the soldiers
have shot the sleigh!
But, sir,
it's Arthur.
- Arthur?
No one gets an
unwrapped present on my watch!
Three bits of sticky tape.
Three!
- Stand up!
- Oh.
Finger!
The church!
Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa!
Right foot!
Left foot!
There it is!
One!
Hands up!
Aaahh! Whoa!
Whoa!
Arthur! Arthur!
Arthur! Arthur! Arthur!
We're nearly there!
Front wheel!
- Two!
- Yes!
That's it, there!
Back wheel!
- Ready?
- Do it!
Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa!
Here we go!
Waaaaaaahhhhh!!!!
Three!
- Elf down.
- Bryony?
Go on, Arthur.
Quick!
There's always time for a bow.
No...
We can't be too late...
So unfair.
Ho! Ho!
Ho, ho!
Merry Christmas!
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
All the Santas
taking the missing present!
It's beautiful!
Hug me! Hug me!
Ha, ha, ha!
Dad!
You came!
I knew you would!
You wouldn't just
go to bed and forget Gwen.
You're Santa!
- Give me that!
- I'm Santa!
- I'm delivering it!
- Don't be silly!
I'm Santa.
Can't you see for me suit?
I am actually Santa,
- but I think it would be best to--
- I'm Santa!
You hand it over!
- You said I could drive!
- I'm Santa, you naughty boys.
Here:  Have a bon-bon.
Ssshhhh...
Please!
Gwen just has to
have a present from Santa!
You do it, Arthur.
Mummy! Daddy!
Wake up!
- Ho, ho, ho.      - Shh!
Merry... Christmas... everyone...
Dad! Wait!
Please! Its...
Oh. In all my years,
I never actually...
Always so busy...
Too busy...
I'm not good at...
In my day, a pat on the back,
and a walnut, went a long way.
Mummy! Daddy!
Come on!
Dad! I heard
something downstairs!
I think it's under the tree!
Oh! What is it?
I can see pink!
- It's a bike!
Santa brought me the bike I wanted!
Oh, can I have a go?
Please? Please? Please?
Steve,
you deserve to be Santa.
But, Steve,
I wonder...
if Gwen...
is right.
Oh! Watch out!
Beep, beep!
Careful! I'm going
to bump into you!
I'll... be the candle, eh?
Ah. Whoopee.
You're better men than--
The both of you.
Oh! A bike, and...
Oh! A squirrel!
Ow!
Drop complete,
and we have a new Santa!
- Arthur!
- Arthur.
You know,
I've always liked Arthur.
You think he likes espresso?
- Oh!
It's so important
to make someone happy
Make just one someone happy
Make just one heart the heart you...
you sing to
One... smile that cheers you
One face that lights
when it nears you
One girl you're...
you're everything to
Fame
if you win it
Comes and goes
in a minute
Where's the real stuff in life
to cling to?
Love
is the answer
Someone to love is the answer
Once you found her
build your world around her
Make
someone happy
Make just one someone happy
and we'll be happy, too
