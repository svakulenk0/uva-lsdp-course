CARL: You have very beautiful toes.
Did l ever tell you that?
Yes, you have.
l'm not even...
l'm not even a foot guy.
They're not even webbed.
Are you concentrating
on the game,
or are you just lusting
after the feet of your
soon-to-be wife?
l'm concentrating.
NElL: Carl, it's Neil.
Are you there?
No, we're not.
NElL: Carl. lt's Neil.
There's a problem.
NElL: There's
a wedding-related problem.
All right, go. Get it.
Hey.
NElL: l hear you whispering
about not answering me.
Just remember,
when this is all over
it's just you and me.
NElL: Carl, if you're humping,
stop, 'cause l'm coming in.
Dude, it's Dupree.
How the hell
did Dupree end up
on the wrong island?
Dupree was born
on the wrong island.
MAN: Gentlemen,
move this out of the way,
please! We're coming through.
Thank you very much.
Right this way, please.
Careful with the boxes.
Ten minutes ago
those were supposed to be out.
Where's Mr. Thompson?
MOLLY:
Dad, this is incredible.
We really didn't
need all this.
l know. But l did.
NElL: Dupree!
There he is.
Did other people land
on the wrong island?
DUPREE: Guys, l know
l'm in the doghouse,
but come on.
These islands,
Maui, Cowee, Lenowi,
very easy to get mixed up.
Don't worry, you're here.
Don't worry.
l got my head
turned around.
l'm sorry.
Come here, you big lug.
All right.
THOMPSON: Thank you.
Folks, this is
a bittersweet time for me.
A day that Molly's mother,
rest her soul,
and l used to dream about.
On one hand, l'm inheriting
a new son-in-law,
but on the other,
Daddy's losing
his only little girl.
Now, when Molly told me
that she was gonna marry Carl,
l said, ''Who?''
And Molly said,
''Daddy, he works for you.''
l said, ''Honey, l've got
But then l started to worry.
Maybe he was some young buck
trying to push me aside,
grab the reins of my company.
And then l met Carl,
sitting in cubicle 26.
And l said,
''You know, l like my chances.''
So, ladies and gentlemen,
will you raise your glass
to Molly and Carl,
to health and happiness.
He's funny.
Cheers.
ALL: Hear! Hear!
ALL: One! Two! Three! Carl!
Hey, everybody,
listen up.
Now, wait.
Just wait.
ln honor of your
impending nuptials,
l want to perform a feat
that l've used to mark
every special occasion
in our lives since
at least high school.
Ladies and gentlemen,
birds and bees,
l present to you
the Flaming Tornado!
Honey, look who's here!
Hi!
This is just
a safety precaution.
Okay. Little room here.
Need to focus.
Barkeep, your finest
Kentucky bourbon,
low-grade tequila...
l've got a mai tai.
Don't let him start
till l get back.
...lemon slices, a funnel,
and an open flame.
NElL: Yeah!
Okay. Funnel.
ALL: Tornado! Tornado!
Open flames.
Carl will have the honor.
Will the groom
please light the liquid?
Carl, grab this.
Carl, you got...
Where...
What are you doing?
Do the Tornado.
Maybe later.
NElL: No!
No.
What are you doing, man?
No, we'll do it later.
Do it now!
MAN: Carl has to be here.
Now!
Let Carl come and do it.
Dude.
l'm doing the Tornado, bitch!
Do that Tornado!
CROWD: Neil! Neil! Neil!
GlRL: Oh, my God!
Yo, Tornado Man.
This one is for you,
my brother.
Nice one.
Well, l guess this is where
the road ends for you and me.
We had a good run,
though, didn't we?
Hey, Dupree, l'm not dying.
l'm just getting married.
Yeah, l know. Hey, listen.
l feel bad about, you know,
earlier when l was laughing
like a hyena
when Mr. Thompson
was making all those
jokes at your expense.
Well, they weren't
really at my expense.
No, no, no, they were.
lt was a shot
across your bow.
Yeah? You think?
lt wasn't that funny.
l mean, it was,
but l shouldn't
have been laughing,
'cause l'm your best man,
and l don't want this guy
getting in your head, okay?
'Cause he's in my head
a little bit.
lt just...
lt's... l don't know.
l don't want you to forget
that you're bringing something
to the table, too, okay?
You've got that...
That Carlness.
That little
twinkle in your eye.
And you're giving it
to me right now.
That little glint
that says they're
never gonna beat you.
They can't lay
a glove on you.
And don't forget that,
because you can't put
a price tag on it.
End of sermon.
Well, thanks, buddy,
l appreciate it.
But, you know, l really think
he was kidding around.
Yeah.
Guy's got a kind of
a weird sense of humor.
Besides, it's not like
l'm gonna be working for him
for the rest of my life.
You know,
l got plans of my own.
There it is.
There's that Carlness.
They can't lay
a glove on you,
can they?
God, l admire you.
l really do.
That's no secret.
Thanks, buddy. Thanks.
Oh, l wanted to give you this.
You know,
for being my best man.
You got to be shitting me.
lt's a flask!
You like it?
l love this.
Good.
Hey, you know, that reminds
me of the groomsmen outfits.
l really like them,
but l'm wondering,
should mine
be a little different
since l'm the best man?
What did you have in mind?
Just like a little
insignia or a patch.
l don't want
people to be confused.
l'm talking
something understated,
like a lightning bolt.
Nothing big.
Lightning bolt?
Something.
Could be cool.
Yeah. l like it.
Although, it is going
to be listed in the program
that you're the best man.
Really?
Uh-huh.
That's pretty good. Okay.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That should be enough.
Now, is Neil gonna be
okay over there?
l'm seeing him,
and it looks like
the tide's coming up.
Neil's gonna be fine.
Bingo!
MOLLY: Oh, wow!
How many thank-you notes
do you think we have to write?
Well, l counted 1 1 1 .
Honey, l'm gonna do
half of them.
Oh, come on. Really?
No, no, no. Really.
Dear whoever gave us
this platter, l love it!
Finally a platter.
Just what l always wanted
ever since l was a little boy.
And now you've made
my platter dreams come true.
That's perfect.
And then you write
and you're done.
Yeah.
MOLLY
And this is Molly.
Molly.
We can't get
to the phone right now.
You've reached the Petersons.
So, if you
leave a message...
Wait for the beep.
...we'll get back to you
as soon as we can.
All right...
Have a beautiful day.
All right, let's do it again.
No. That was really cute.
l called you Carl.
lt was really funny.
Molly, it was cheesy.
No, it wasn't cheesy.
Give it to me.
lt's totally cheesy.
Give me the machine.
No! lt's good cheesy!
Give me the machine.
No!
PACO: lD?
Hey, married guy,
how you doing?
Good morning, Reese.
lD?
Top of the morning, Paco.
So, we're back
from the honeymoon.
Oh, yeah, we...
We had a great time, sir.
lt was just...
lt was really wonderful.
So l took a look
at your proposal
while you were gone.
The Oaks at Mesa Vista.
You like it?
Did l like it?
l loved it!
lt's perfect for lot 208.
lf l may, Mr. Thompson, it...
Mesa Vista is really
more of a smaller,
Not anymore, Carl.
You got to think big,
you got to think bold.
You're a married man now.
You're married
to my little girl.
l'm fast-tracking
this project.
And you, sir,
you're the lead designer
on it.
Excuse me, sir?
That's right.
You are the lead designer.
Wow, that's...
Wow, that's...
That's great.
What happened to Harrison?
l had to let him go
while you were gone.
l had a little problem
with Rancho del Mar.
But, Carl,
l believe in you.
You've got it.
lt's here and it's here.
Release it.
Okay. l'll do that, sir.
Release it.
Wow! l can't believe it.
He made you lead designer.
Yeah. Apparently,
he just loved my proposal.
And it's a little bit bigger
than l initially planned,
but you know, hey,
maybe that's a good thing.
So, what does this mean?
Well, it means
l've got my own office.
O
A view of trees and some cars.
lt's just terrific, and...
Living the dream, honey.
Living the dream.
MOLLY
M
a little when you get
home tonight from guys' night.
Are you trying to seduce me?
I
CARL: What's up, guys?
DUPREE: Carl, you made it!
DUPREE:
lntense matches going on.
Guys' night, man!
Hey, there he is!
Guys' night!
Can you feel the fun
for the guys' night?
l can just feel it,
you know?
Shit balls!
What's that?
lt's my alarm. My hour's up.
That's it for me.
What, are you kidding me?
Bullshit.
Where are you going?
l've got to go
meet my wife
and watch S
l don't... How late
do you get to stay out?
l used to have midnight.
Do you get midnight?
'Cause l was late once, and...
l'm a grown man, Neil.
l don't have a curfew.
Not yet you don't.
But in all seriousness,
you got to tell me something,
okay?
Do l smell like beer?
Yeah.
Good. Because you know what
l don't smell like, then?
Cigarettes and weed.
That one's free.
Yeah!
The dream continues!
Still undefeated!
Yes! Nice.
Will you look at this guy?
Look at you.
ls this what it looks like
to be married?
Come here, man.
lt's still early on.
To fidelity, commitment,
the whole shebang.
Yeah, and l also
got a promotion today.
Add it to the list.
Forever blessed
as the dream continues.
How are you doing, buddy?
How am l doing?
Good question.
Turns out l got fired
for taking that week off
to go to the wedding.
Wait a minute.
You got fired?
Apparently,
l never had authorization.
My boss claims
he never received my e-mail.
Then l had a little bit
of a cash flow situation,
so l ended up
losing my apartment.
You're not living
out of your car?
Carl, l'm not an animal.
Plus, it was a company car.
So when l lost the job...
lt's okay.
l picked up a ten-speed.
Dave's letting me crash
at the bar after hours.
Dupree,
you can't sleep in a bar.
We're not in our 20s anymore.
Sure you can. l got
a cot set up in the back.
This is ridiculous.
Look, you're gonna
come home and you're
going to stay with us.
That's sweet of you to say,
but l can't impose,
and l won't.
Dupree will land
on his feet as always.
Can l have a toast, please?
Thank you.
Listen, Dupree,
we've got to get
rid of the cot.
Some of the regulars
are starting to complain.
They don't think it's fair
that you get to sleep here
and they don't.
Curley said that, didn't he?
Curley? Curley!
What?
What? You got a problem
with me sleeping on the cot?
We all have a problem
with you sleeping on the cot.
We took a vote.
The ayes have it.
Dupree? Live with us?
Not live.
Just stay for a couple of days
until he gets back
on his feet.
Molly, he's been
sleeping in a bar.
How does that happen?
Who knows? lt's Dupree.
l mean, l told you.
His mother moved to
Florida with that yoga idiot,
and all of his friends
are married,
including myself.
He's got nowhere to go.
He's like an orphan.
Wait a second.
What's all this?
This is that celebration
we were supposed to have
about your promotion.
Oh, that's right.
l'm sorry, hon.
Look, Molly,
let me go outside
and tell Dupree
to bring his bags in...
What? Dupree's here?
Carl! Carl.
Carl.
Okay, look, you're right.
l screwed up. l did this
all wrong, and l'm sorry.
l should have called first.
You know what?
Maybe l should just give him
some money for a motel.
Carl. Carl.
He's your best friend.
He's here.
He can stay.
That's great, Molly.
Look, it's only gonna
be for a couple days.
Well, a week at the most.
Okay.
After that,
he's out of here.
Keep those candles burning.
l'll be right back.
Okay.
Hey, Molly.
l want you to know l really,
really appreciate this, okay?
Yeah. No. lt's really
no problem, Dupree.
Thanks.
Nice moose.
Oh, yeah.
Murphy,
say hello to the missus.
Hi, Murphy.
Come on in, buddy.
Make yourself at home.
Great.
l hope the couch
is okay 'cause
we're working on
everything upstairs.
Oh, yeah. l'm fine anyplace.
And you know
where everything is.
Thank you.
Great.
Thanks.
Thank you. And, hey, listen,
just to put your minds
at ease,
this is not a permanent
situation. Okay?
l'm hitting the job trail,
l'm gonna hit it hard
tomorrow.
Wheels of change
are in motion.
Good. Good.
That's a good attitude.
Despite what my ex-boss said,
l'm not unhirable.
Those copiers didn't exactly
sell themselves.
And frankly, l think
we had an inferior product,
and l'd tell people that
if they asked.
l wasn't going to lie
for that son of...
l don't want to get
started on him, but...
Okay, great.
Well, make yourself at home,
and Molly and l are...
Well,
we're going to go upstairs
and take care of some stuff.
Well, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Listen, we're all adults here.
You're newlyweds.
Making love's
a big part of that.
You're supposed to
explore each other.
l get it.
Come on.
lf this situation's
gonna work,
we've got to be honest
with each other.
Now, go on.
Enjoy yourselves.
l'm not gonna listen.
Hump away. Go on,
get out of here.
Good night.
Okay.
Good night.
MOLLY: l'm kind of dreading
the talk with his parents.
He hasn't really been treating
anybody very nicely at...
That's not good.
No. Not for us
or our couch.
Computer skills. Not really.
The Oaks at Mesa Vista.
This is exciting, isn't it?
Stunning. Just stunning.
You know, sir, if we're
not gonna have any trees,
maybe we should consider
changing the name.
No. No, no,
l love the name.
Names are important, Carl.
Are you gonna
answer that phone?
Give me a second.
What do you want?
D
Real quick, where
do you keep the plungers?
A plunger? What do you need
a plunger for?
No reason. Just want
to stay on top of stuff.
What do you mean ''no reason''?
What happened?
No reason. l just want
to know where things are
in case there's an emergency,
which there probably
never will be.
l don't have time for this.
l'm...
l don't have time for this.
l'm at work. l got to go.
You better
make some time for it
'cause we got
a little bit of a situation.
l didn't want to have to
say anything, but...
Carl?
Just stopped.
Where were we?
We were talking
about names, Carl.
How important they are.
Would you ever
consider letting
Molly keep her last name?
l mean, l know
it's a strange request
coming from a father-in-law,
but a man's name
is his legacy,
and if Molly takes yours,
then the Thompson name
dies with me.
Well, there's lots
of Thompsons around,
aren't there?
Not in a direct line, Carl.
No, no, not in a direct line.
Well, what about our kids?
Children should have
the last name of the father,
don't you think?
You're having kids?
Well, not right now,
but eventually.
You know, in certain
Asian cultures, Carl,
the husband
takes the wife's name.
Wait a minute. You just said
a man's legacy is his name.
All right.
What about a hyphen?
A hyphen?
Yeah.
l could ask Molly,
but l don't think she...
Wait a minute. You mean me.
You mean
l'm supposed to hyphenate.
Well, then you can still use
your own name, only you'll be
hyphenating it. lt's win-win.
With all due respect,
not for me it isn't, sir.
All right, forget it.
You're obviously upset
about it.
You know what,
l'm sorry l even
brought it up.
Let's keep focused
on your project.
Come on! Come on! Toshi,
what are you doing?
You gave him a meatball!
BOY: Watch the car!
DUPREE: Throw it, throw it.
We got him.
Throw it, throw it!
Did he touch the plate? He...
Oh, here we go.
The game just turned. Yes!
Carl Peterson,
third team honorable mention.
All-district, 1984.
We get Carl.
BOY: No, we get him.
Hey, what's going on?
There he is.
Hey, sweet heat.
Time to dust off
the old jockstrap.
This kid Dougie's been
killing us all afternoon.
We need your arm out there.
Let's go.
Dupree, l'd love to,
but l can't. l kind of
had a rough day.
And l better go in
and see Molly.
l like it.
Family first. Priorities.
Okay, he can't play.
We're gonna have to
do it ourselves.
Now listen, l want you to
brush him back here, okay?
What's a brushback?
lt's where you throw it
really close to him.
Scare him a little bit,
but don't hit him
'cause he's bigger
than you.
But, Mr. Dupree,
l don't even play baseball.
l'm in the orchestra,
remember?
First of all, call me Dupree
'cause l'm your team-mate.
Second of all, so what
if you're in the orchestra.
So was Catfish Hunter.
Let's go. Let's go.
Here we go! Here we go!
Hey, batter, batter...
Hi! How was work?
lt was fine.
Good fine? Bad fine?
Fine, fine.
You wouldn't believe
the response l'm getting
for my Career Day program.
And l saved a spot
for you on the 15th
if you're interested.
Yeah, of course.
l'll bring in some blueprints
and maybe even some models.
lt'll be fun.
TOSHl: No. Get away.
DOUGlE: You hit me!
You hit me on purpose!
The kids'll really love it.
MAN: No more fighting.
Thank you, that's it!
Hey! Hey! Come on now!
Break it up. That's it!
D Hola,
I
I
Can you believe that?
A little chin music
and the whole neighborhood
goes crazy.
lt was like...
O
Oh, l meant
to tell you about that.
l changed the
answering machine in case
somebody calls about a job.
l'm staying on top
of this job thing.
You guys are okay with that,
right?
We got to put the job first.
Well, Carl,
are we okay with that?
Molly. Molly, come on.
Nice.
MAN ON
When did we get HBO?
Yeah, you saw that.
l upgraded us, and l'm
going to go halfsies on it
'cause l love it also.
You get it upstairs,
too.
l think you get
the Oxygen channel, too.
What? What are you doing?
What?
What do you want? Cinemax?
MOLLY: So, let me get this
straight. l mean, he hijacks
our answering machine.
''Carl and Molly, press two.''
Okay?
And then he decides,
''Hey, l'm sleeping
on the couch,
''and l'm gonna order HBO.''
l mean, l don't know, Carl.
Am l wrong here?
Carl!
Molly, what do you want
me to do, whack the guy?
Look, l told Dupree
not to change anything
without asking,
and l gave him
a pair of pajamas.
Dupree's gonna
get the hang of this.
He's never truly been
domesticated. He's like
the ape-man of Borneo.
Oh, so we're the lucky ones
who get to housebreak him?
No, you know what l mean,
honey.
l'm over it.
l finished
my thank-you notes today.
Do you need help
with your half?
No, no, no, l...
Candlesticks, bread maker,
Crock-Pot. l got them covered.
lt's my final offer.
No, l got them covered.
Sorry to interrupt. Oh!
Damn it, Dupree!
What is this?
This is an emergency.
l'm sorry.
The downstairs crapper,
it's on the fritz again.
What do you mean,
''lt's on the fritz''?
l don't know.
lt's on the fritz.
Please tell me he's joking.
We might need some matches.
Does that
answer your question?
MOLLY: Oh, God!
Dupree! Oh, my God. l don't...
Carl! Carl!
Dupree! Dupree?
Yo!
Dupree, what you did
in our bathroom last night
was disgusting.
Molly nearly passed out.
l know, l know.
Believe me.
l'm never eating
Buffalo wings again.
l don't care how much
l love them. l'm off them.
lt's weird. l used to have
a stomach like a billy goat,
but not anymore.
Now, l made a little breakfast
for... Molly, great.
Come here.
Morning.
DUPREE: Good morning.
Right here. Let me get
this chair for you here.
Have a seat.
Breakfast is served.
Yes.
l believe Carl told me
you're a fan of
the banana pancake
and the soy macchiato.
One second.
DUPREE: l want
this to be perfect.
Did you tell him all this?
Here you go.
Soy macchiato.
Dupree, you really
didn't have to do all this.
Yes, l did have to do this.
Look, l know l got off
on the wrong foot,
and l just want you both
to know that l really
appreciate this.
And l'm grateful.
l don't know
what to say, but...
Don't say anything.
Just accept my apology
and enjoy this feast.
l'm off to a very promising
job interview
which explains
my natty attire.
Wish me luck. Goodbye.
CARL: Good luck.
Go get them, tiger!
l will. Thank you.
Off like a prom dress.
MANAGER: So, why don't you
describe yourself, Mr. Dupree.
l'm a people person.
Very personable.
l absolutely insist
on enjoying life.
Not so task-oriented.
l'm not a workhorse.
lf you're looking
for a Clydesdale,
l'm probably not your man.
Like, l don't live to work.
lt's more the other way
around. l work to live.
lncidentally, what's
your policy on Columbus Day?
Yeah, we work.
Really?
The guy discovered
the New World.
l'm afraid to even ask
about Victory over Japan Day.
LAD Y O
Y
Hey, we tried. Right?
Thanks a lot. Yeah.
l'm gonna keep my résumé.
Excuse me.
You've got to lean into it
and commit to it.
That's the way.
You get hurt if you're afraid.
And if you time it
just right, then you both...
There he goes. Come down.
You guys got to
get a rhythm going.
Come on.
Here, watch me. See, l'm just
running down the ramp.
lt's actually harder
than on a skateboard.
There we go.
Speed's your friend. Hold on.
Yeah, come down. Go.
You see how he's timing it?
And then he pops it up? Go!
Yes! Go! One more time.
So,
what's going on over here?
Carl, check out this badass
skate ramp l had Aaron's dad
build for us.
Hey, man, l was just
telling these guys how we used
to tear it up back in the day.
Yep! Pretty good.
Hey, l got an idea.
What do you say we put on
a little show for these guys?
Throw down some one-wheelers.
Make it rain out here.
Come on. For a second.
BOY 1 : Yeah,
let's see what you got.
BOY 2: Yeah,
show us something.
Okay, give me a board.
Yes! Carl!
Step aside, guys.
Honey, l need some help.
CARL: Yep,
just like back in the day.
DUPREE: Nice!
CARL: Let's show them
how we used to do it.
DUPREE: Step aside.
Step aside.
Well, no one ever said
we were gonna live forever.
Let's go.
Carl! Carl,
what are you doing?
What's it look like
he's doing? He's getting
ready to rip it up.
Relax, Molly.
This is only gonna
take a second.
BOY: Come on, Dupree!
Say when.
When!
Yeah!
DUPREE: Oh, l'm racked!
Carl!
Oh, l racked
my little Duprees.
When was the last time
you were even on a skateboard?
Oh.
For a second there
we almost had it back.
CARL: Yeah.
CARL: What is this?
Are you kidding me?
Are you kidding me?
ls this some kind of a joke?
Carl,
Thompson wanted more units.
Thought it would work better
as a wraparound.
Wraparound.
Mesa Vista
is not a wraparound.
Paco.
Good night, boss.
Look, Mr. Thompson.
Hey. You see
the preliminaries?
Yeah, l did, and
it's completely different
than my original proposal.
God damn it, Carl.
Will you stop fighting this?
People buy homes.
Let the government
pay for the parks.
That's why we have taxes.
The Oaks at Mesa Vista
is a money train.
You wanna be on it?
Yeah, l'm on it.
Money train.
l'll give you a money train.
DUPREE:
Right there! Right there!
You gotta throw it now!
NElL: Please, please, please!
No, he didn't go over!
No! No! Why?
He didn't make it, man.
Carl! Welcome home!
Come here, buddy!
We got one for you.
DUPREE: Get a beer for him.
What are you guys doing?
We're watching the game.
Yeah, l can see that.
Hey, guys!
Please, shut the hell up
for two seconds
'cause it's
fourth and inches.
Please, just shut up.
You shut up!
NElL: lt's fourth and inches!
Why don't you watch it
in your house?
l can't have friends
over on weeknights
and you know that.
Grow a sac.
lt's not my problem, Neil.
Take it up with Annie.
Time for the lion tamer.
Yeah, well, l can't
talk to him like this.
What's going on?
You all right?
Yeah. l'm fine.
God, l've been
watching you lately, man,
and you're really putting in
the hours, but you got
to find some balance.
Find a little Carl time.
You know what l'm saying?
Carl time.
MAN ON
N
You're right.
Carl time.
Come here.
Molly's got the
Back to School
thing tonight.
We got the house
to ourselves for a while.
Let's watch the game.
Let your hair down.
Let your hair down.
l mean...
You think l've been
overdoing it
with the work thing?
l know you've been
overdoing it.
Yeah. Shake it loose, huh?
Just live a little, man.
Just live a little.
Yeah. You know,
maybe l ought to
make my nachos.
Nice!
Yes!
Carl time!
NElL: Nachos, Carl nachos
are in my belly.
CARL: Hey, Neil,
turn up the volume.
Okay. Yeah, yeah.
You know who else loves
Carl's nachos is Eddie.
Give him a call.
l already did.
Carl, soup them up, man!
Make them spicy!
Okay, guys.
This is it. This is it.
Come on. Just come on.
Please. Please, God!
Send everybody!
Send everybody!
Yes! Yes! Yes!
Damn!
DUPREE: No, no.
NElL: No, no.
No!
No, no!
No! No!
No!
Yes!
What did l tell you?
That's what l'm saying!
Congratulations, idiots.
Congratulations, guys.
Very good.
Fifty pushups, faggot.
Fifty pushups.
l'm not giving you
any pushups.
That was the deal.
Fine. Okay? Enjoy it.
ALL: One, two...
He has a condition.
ALL: ...three, four.
That's right!
l have a condition.
l should not keep doing this.
Come on!
NElL: l have a gamey colon,
and it gets spastic
and spasms.
CARL:
You don't have a condition.
Carl. Carl! Neil,
shut up! Carl.
l didn't read that.
Mark, what? What is it, Mark?
Molly.
Hi.
Oh, hey, Molly.
CARL: You're home early.
Really?
l just invited
some of the guys over
to watch a little football.
Figured it was just a
little time to loosen up.
A little Carl time.
M margarita!
Dupree.
Molly.
ALL: Charlie.
Brilliant.
CHARLlE: Sorry.
We should go.
You guys want to go?
Yeah, let's get out of here.
That's a good idea.
Let's go to Larry's.
Let's get out of here.
Let it go. Let it go.
CHARLlE: What'd l do
with my tie?
Let's go.
Bye.
Sorry, l ashed on your floor.
Great.
Take that tie off your head.
l'll bring this back tomorrow.
l'll give it to Carl
at the office.
So, don't tell Annie
l was here. And if you do,
don't...
Just don't tell her that
l asked you not to...
Get out, Neil.
Out!
Okay. l'll just go.
l know what you're thinking,
Molly.
But we were gonna have
this rug shampooed.
l promise you.
Oh, and look. Look at that.
lt's my grandmother's
silver cheese platter.
You used it to serve nachos.
Well,
nachos have cheese in them.
Let me just start
cleaning up some of...
Dupree, please stop.
Somebody arriving
late for the party.
Don't worry about it.
The party... Game's over!
Go away! The party's over!
Party... Molly,
for the love of God! Please!
We heard there were
some bad boys in here.
There were, but they left.
You know, Carl, l...
l really think l've been
pretty cool about this
whole situation,
and l hate having
this conversation with you.
But this is not exactly
how l pictured us
getting started.
l know.
Look, Dupree's got to go.
No. lt's not about
kicking Dupree out.
lt's just that you said
it was gonna be
a couple of days.
Look, Molly.
He's my best friend.
Somehow l feel
responsible for him.
Then maybe it's time
to start prioritizing
your responsibilities.
You're right.
What if he had
a girlfriend?
Good idea.
But how is a guy
with no job, no car,
living on somebody's couch
gonna find
any kind of girlfriend?
Our new librarian.
She seems really nice.
You want to fix Dupree up
with a really nice librarian?
Listen, l know the guy
for 25 years.
l think he's more into
the young, foreign,
non-librarian type.
Well, it wouldn't hurt to ask.
l wouldn't get my hopes up.
l'll do it.
Oh, that's great.
Do you want to know
anything about her?
No. Well, does she have a car?
Yeah. She does.
Good. See if she can swing by
and get me around 8:00.
Or quarter to.
Tonight?
Please.
Okay.
Candy?
Mandy.
Mandy. That's even better.
Librarian.
No. No.
l thought you were
really brave.
l mean, l have a whole new
respect for you, Carl.
Well, the rice was okay,
but just for the record,
octopus does not
taste like chicken.
But you ate it.
What is that?
lt looks like Dupree
brought his date home.
Honey, what is a tie
doing on our door?
Molly, l think we ought to
drive around the block
a couple times.
Wait a minute. No way.
Mandy's a Mormon.
She's not the kind of girl...
A Mormon?
...who would get busy
on the first date.
You fixed Dupree up
with a Mormon librarian.
Molly, wait!
Oh, my God.
What?
Let's drive
around the block.
Carl!
That butter dish
was our wedding gift.
Guys, guys! Hold it!
Let me explain.
What was he doing with butter?
Dupree, no need to explain.
lt's not what it looks like.
Dupree,
no explanation necessary.
l know.
Go back in the house!
Not before l thank Molly
for the best night of my life.
Mol, Mol. Thank you.
What happened in there,
it was so natural.
So beautiful.
Go back inside.
Listen, l've got neighbors.
l know you do.
But listen to me.
l'm in love.
Dupree. Dupree,
l'm not going to do this
with you tonight!
Jesus! Molly,
call the fire department!
Oh, my...
Carl!
Mandy!
Mandy! Mandy!
MOLLY: Fire in our house!
lt's fire!
CARL: My couch!
DUPREE: Roll!
God, l loved this couch.
You know,
when l saw you on fire,
my heart stopped.
l had so much adrenaline
pumping through me,
l probably could have...
Could have picked up this car
and just hurled it 10 blocks.
Are you gonna do this,
or am l gonna have to?
l'll take care of it.
Tonight, Carl.
Go on, get out of here.
Or l'm not responsible
for what these hands
are gonna do. Go!
Bye.
You okay?
Yeah.
Yeah, just a little
smoke inhalation.
Wow. Unbelievable.
Mandy was
completely unharmed.
Fire chief said that
the butter probably
saved her life.
You talk about a miracle.
You just got to thank
the big man.
lt's all you can...
What is wrong with you?
Why did you have to use
so many candles?
l was just trying
to set a mood.
You know how l am, Carl.
Yeah. l do.
Look...
lt's about time
you got on the road.
You guys need any help?
No, we're good. Relax.
DUPREE: Well,
l had a lovely stay.
Thank you both
for your generosity.
Sorry about last night,
and no hard feelings.
l hope. At least,
there are none on my part.
Okay. Are you sure
you got a place to go?
Yeah. l got a place to go.
Going to Mandy's.
The librarian?
Don't you think
that's kind of moving
a little quickly, Dupree?
Maybe it is, but so what?
Something special
is happening there.
l'm not gonna fight it.
Hey, take care of this
big mook for me.
Bye. See you guys.
Tosh, listen.
You got the heart
of a damn lion.
l respect you.
You took a beating,
but you took it like a man.
God bless all of you.
DUPREE: Goodbye!
Off to Mandy's!
Oh, my God! Carl.
Okay!
Sir, are you sure
you're okay?
DUPREE: My helmet saved me.
You see that?
He's gonna be fine.
Here's your bag.
Thank you.
Bye!
Bye.
Carl.
Carl?
We've been staring at this
for over two hours.
Let's go get some dinner.
Or margaritas.
Celebrate our emancipation.
The insurance adjuster
recommended that we
sue Dupree.
For a moose head?
Just curious.
lt was the margarita
that did it, wasn't it?
lt was the emancipation
that did it.
CARL: l like this song.
S
S
Oh, my God.
What?
Are you kidding me?
What the hell is he doing?
MOLLY: l thought
he was going to Mandy's.
Honey, l don't think
he can see us.
Maybe we should
just keep going.
lt's pouring rain outside.
Not that bad.
Honey, look at him.
What?
Damn it.
Molly. Molly!
Dupree!
Dupree.
Dupree, what are you doing?
lt's pouring rain outside.
l don't know
what l'm doing anymore.
Yeah, well,
what about Mandy?
Don't ask.
Carl, can you get his bike?
Come on. Let's go.
Let's go home.
MOLLY: Carl, honey, bike.
MOLLY: Carl!
l'm coming!
l really appreciate this,
guys.
Trust me, no more open flames.
l've learned my lesson.
All right, well,
it's been a long night.
So, l'm gonna go to bed.
Dupree, try not to go to sleep
with that head wet. Okay?
Good night, Molly.
Dupree. l don't mean
to come down on you,
but you need to start
getting your life together.
We're grown-ups now.
Yeah.
You know what l mean?
l know. l know.
You're right.
And if you're going to
stay here, things are gonna
be different from now on.
No more naked stuff.
Well, it felt natural
to be naked. l...
l don't care!
Okay.
l do not care.
Clean up after yourself,
watch the noise,
try to help out
around the house, please?
lt's not too much to ask.
You're right.
Carl? l can be really helpful
when l set my mind to it.
And that's what l'm gonna do.
Oh, and...
Another thing.
Would you mind writing
some thank-you notes for me?
Okay.
Yeah. That'd be great.
Try to get some sleep.
Gut-check time, Dupree.
''Dear Aunt Kathy.
''Thank you so much
for the wine glasses.''
MAN ON
A
Hello?
Yeah, Dupree.
l'm gonna need you
to do me a solid.
Yeah, no problem.
What do you got?
l promised Molly
l would give this Career Day
presentation today at 1 :00.
But her father just dropped
a big one on me,
so l'm gonna need you
to step in and fill in for me.
Can you do that?
l don't know, Carl.
l don't know
the first thing about
the development business.
l really think Mr. Thompson
might find me in over my head.
No, not the development
business. School, Dupree.
No, no, no. Not this time.
What?
No, no, l'm talking
to Lance Armstrong.
He's trying to break away
from the pack.
l got him, though.
Will you quit dicking around
with your little Huffy bike
and listen to me?
