Okay. One picture
and we're history.
That's what I'm afraid of.
Come on.
You want everyone
at school to think
we're chicken?
I could live with that.
You wuss. Come on.
Oh, whoa!
Oh, man!
I-I don't see anything.
Do you?
No, I don't
see anything.
Let's just take the picture
and get outta here.
Fine, fine. Here,
take the picture.
Now, wait a minute. I gotta
be in the picture too, or no one
will believe I was here.
Just shut up
and take the picture.
No, you take the picture.
You take it.
You!

Foundation: $1.2 million.
To the Patagonian Wasp
Salvation Fund: $1.4 million.
...
To hell with the livestock.
What'd the old stiff
leave me?
Um, I believe that
what the bereaved...
is trying to express
is that the sudden death...
of her  father has
left a great gaping void...
in her bank...
in her life.
Carrigan wonders what he has
left her to fill it up with.
Hmm. Let's see.
Bobcats, owls,
Whipstaff Manor in Maine.
And?
And I'm late for lunch,
so if you'll excuse me.
Are you trying to tell me
that I just spent
the last two days...
holding his clammy hand,
waiting for him to kick,
and all I get in return
is one lousy piece of property?
No, it was  50 years ago.
Now it's condemned.
Enjoy.
Wait a minute!
This is not fair!
Knock yourself out.
Dibs! This is all
your fault, as usual.
If you would have just
forged the damn will.
Carrigan, this is
condemned  property.
Oh, Dibs!
Don't you get it?
Flipper got more money
than me.
Carrigan,
the deed's in there!
Oh! Ouch!
Ow. Ouch!
"Buccaneers
and buried gold.
Whipstaff doth
a treasure hold."
Treasure?
Dibs, you idiot!
Get it out!
I knew that place was
worth something. There's
treasure in that house.
And finally, I'm gonna
get what I deserve.
Carrigan,
I think I need a doctor.
Oh, there's plenty in Maine.
So... what do you think?
I think you're
gonna get wet.
Hey! Wait!
Carrigan!
Carrigan!
Dibs, light, light!
What a dump.
This place is fabulous.
You could just do
so much with it.
I mean, it's
a bit spooky.
Dibs.
Aaah! Aaah!
Huh?
Who is it?
Who is it?
Why not?
Why not?
...
Is he the caretaker?
Are you the caretaker?
Is he a transient?
Is he...
Are you a transient?
Tell him
to show himself.
Show yourself!
Are you a burglar?
I must warn you
that I am armed.
Hello?
Listen!
Cut the crap, okay?
If you don't show yourself,
I'm gonna have you arrested
for trespassing!
Hi! I'm Casper!
You shouldn't do that
or you'll wake up...
Too late.
So tell me,
you have experience?
I have-a quite a bit
of experience.
Not, you know,
like, exactly doin' it.
But I've studied it,
and I've talked to people
who have done it.
I've-a seen videos,
and I feel very confident
with-a my knowledge...
I could do it,
no problem.
Then you can
handle this?
It's-a no problem.
It's-a like no problem
whatsoever. Piece of cake.
Piece of  cake.
Well?
How did it go?
Oh, it was-a fine.
Was, uh, no problem.
Piece of cake.
Who you gonna call?
Someone else.
What do we do now?
What do I usually do
when something stands
in my way?
Um, are you sure
we're not going
a tad overboard here?
Dibs, I have huffed and puffed.
Now I want to rip
this place down.
I want my treasure.
They can't haunt a pile
of rubble, for Christ's sake.
You're sweaty
male construction types,
for Christ's sake!
Dibs, do something.
Charlie, quick, keep runnin'!
Don't look back!
Run, Charlie, run!
Oh, every time.
All I want's a friend.
Did you ever feel the way
Priscilla Cow felt?
That you'd like to be
completely different?
Almost everybody feels
like that once in a while.
But most of the time,
I hope you can be glad
to be yourself.
That's really
something to celebrate.
A g-g-ghost!
More on the Pentagon playboys
as the story unfolds, but now:
Step aside, Sigmund Freud.
Jump back, Joyce Brothers.
It's Dr. James Harvey,
therapist to the dead?
Are you depressed, anxious?
Are you lonely?
Do you need someone to talk to?
No problem,
if you're a ghost.
You can call them ghosts,
if you like, or as I prefer,
the living impaired.
But the bottom line is,
they need help sometimes.
Just like the rest of us.
After the sudden, unexpected
death of his wife Amelia,
Dr. Harvey gave up
conventional psychiatry and,
some say, conventional sanity.
Now, along with his
loner daughter, Kat...
short for Kathy...
Doc Harvey travels from
town to town, searching
for paranoid poltergeists,
scared specters,
the depressed and the dead.
How do you feel about what
your father does for a living?
Could you please
not ask me any questions?
Do you believe
in ghosts? Ever seen one?
Does your father ever hurt you?
He's my father.
Could you just talk to us?
Look, it's the first day of school.
I'm sure I'm gonna have homework,
so would you please?
Carrigan.
But who is this man...
No, not "I ate fish."
I hate fish.
Don't you have cows here?
Listen, I have had
a long and trying day.
Do you think you could bring me
a pint of Haagen-Dazs ice cream,
rum raisin, and a Diet Pepsi?
Think you can handle that?
Now you want me to hold.
Fine.
With therapy, they can
begin to process this pain.
They can pack up
their emotional baggage,
and they can move on.
My Harry passed away
five years ago,
but he was so miserable,
his spirit wouldn't leave
the apartment.
So I called Dr. Harvey.
He came over.
And in a few weeks,
Harry left, smiling.
It's a lack of resolution.
Ghosts are simply spirits
without resolution,
with unfinished business.
It's my job to find out
what that is.
This week they're in Santa Fe.
But next week? Boo knows?
Yes, I'm still here.
Get me Santa Fe.

* That's what
all the people say *
* You're ridin' high in April
shot down in... **
Oh, honey, I'm sorry
about your Cactus Spooners.
Crooners.
I don't care what they said.
You are not demented.
You're a picture
of mental health.
They were talking about
Try explaining
afterlife therapy to
a bunch of junior high kids.
Some people go through life
never questioning the norm.
But you and I, we're doing
something extraordinary
with our lives.
No,  aren't doing anything.
You're the one who's been
packing up my stuff and
moving me around the country.
In two years, I have been
to nine different schools.
I have eaten in nine
different cafeterias.
I can't even
remember anyone's name.
For once, I would
just like to be...
in one place long enough
to make a friend.
Honey, you will.
I mean, come on.
We're movin' to
Friendship, Maine.
Even I might make one.
You better, Dad.
'Cause a single guy your age
is more likely to become
a bank hostage...
than to make new friends.
You sound like your mother.
You're not gonna find her.
Mom's not a ghost, Dad.
Oh, yes, she is.
She has unfinished business.
There's no such thing
as ghosts.
I'll tell you what.
You go with me
this one last time.
If I don't find what
I'm looking for, it's over.
No more moving,
no more ghost mining.
You promise?
I promise.
Deal.
Deal.
Wow! It's not
so bad, huh?
If you're Stephen King.
Dr. Harvey, hello.
I'm Carrigan Crittenden.
And this is Dibs.
Hello.
I'm a close,
personal friend.
Ah.
And this is my daughter, Kat.
His close,
personal daughter.
How nice to meet you,
Kat.
Very nice to meet you.
You have
a beautiful daughter.
Very beautiful.
I can't tell you
how happy we are
you could come to Whipstaff.
Very happy.
The both of us.
You're kind of
hurting my face.
Sorry. Now, Dr. Harvey,
Tell me you go
in the house and spray
and that's it.
Pssssst!
No, no, no.
As with a traditional
psychological cure, it can
take weeks or years for...
Excuse me. You didn't
just say the word "years,"
did you?
It's conceivable.
No, it isn't.
- Days is conceivable.
Weeks, maybe.
- Possibly.
- Months? No.
Years? Forget it!
- Forget it.
Dibs, check.
Get the bouquet.
Now, Dr. Harvey.
I will be watching you
very closely.
These are for you!
Have a lovely night.
Wow.
It's her. She's here.
She's in my house. I did it!
What if she likes me?
What if she doesn't?
Hi, I'm Casper.
I'm a ghost?
No, that's total disaster. Oh!
Yo, I'm Casper.
So, give me four.
Oh, God,
I'd kill for a pinky.
Huh? See?
That was easy.
Yeah. These should hold for now,
but we ought to get a box
of 20 amps in the morning.
Oh, uh,
right, yeah.
Uh, twenties
should be fine.
All right, I'm gonna
go find a room, Dad.
You gonna be
all right alone?
Hey, if I'm not
back in ten days,
send a search party.
Man, they had cruel parents.
Wonder where
Doc and Dopey sleep.
Dad! I found my room.
There's a girl...
on my bed. Yes!
Hey, space master.
In here.
Oh.
Have you seen
any surprises yet?
Please. This is
the deadest place yet.
Oh, this is
a nice room.
Yeah, right. This place
is a freak's holiday.
Hi... Ooh! Ooh!
Oh.
Mom belongs over here.
Hey, how about
if I help you unpack?
Why bother?
We'll just be repacking
in two weeks anyway, right?
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
This place is... fine.
Good. Night, Bucket.
Night, Dad.
We're gonna be glad we came.
You watch.
Wh... Whoa!
Ooh, ooh!
Uh...
I... No.
I...
Uh...
Uh... Hi?
Oh, man!
Perfect first impression.
What a jerk.
Better?
Hon... Honey?
Honey, what?
Dad, Dad,
I saw a ghost!
It was a real ghost.
It was a real, live ghost.
Slow down. What?
I saw a ghost.
It had a head, and it was round,
and it was white and see-through.
Honey, wait.
Now maybe...
Dad, please.
Do not think I'm as crazy
as I thought you were.
I promise.
No, no, no.
But remember, ghosts
can't hurt you, okay?
They're simply spirits
with unfinished business.
Let's just see
about this ghost.
Come here. Come on.
Check here. Oop, see?
No ghost there.
Now we can check over here.
Nope.
Oh! No, there's
no ghost in there.
We can even check over here.
There. See?
Pleasure to meet you, sir.
Dad!
Put me down!
This is insane.
What are you doing?
I can walk, you know?
Right. Now, I want you
to stay in here...
no matter what
you hear, okay?
Okay.
Okay.
Wait.
What?
Dad, I'm sorry.
For what?
For not believing you.
For thinking you were
a total loser.
Aw, honey...
Apologize later.
Blew it, blew it,
blew it, blew it...
Uh-oh, it's them.
Here they come!
Yee-haw!
Man, oh, man,
them ponies run faster
when we go down to Belmont.
Here, Flicka.
Bleaaugh!
Hey, guys.
Have fun?
Oh, look, it's Casper.
Casper.
You know on a scale
of one to ten...
ten being fun,
and one being you...
yeah, we had fun.
Giddyup there.
Say, bulbhead, why ain't you
inside doin' your chores?
Yeah, where's dinner?
I'm starvin'.
I'm wastin' away.
I know. How about you guys
relax out here, and tonight
we'll eat al fresco?
Hey, sounds great.
Who's that?
Short sheet, you wouldn't
be trying to keep us
outta the house, would ya?
No! No!
I can see right through
that bulbous head of yours.
It's just such
a lovely night.
I thought we'd
have fun eating
under the harvest moon.
* Shine on *
**
* Shine on, harvest moon
Up in the sky **
Aaah!
Hey, hold it.
Hey, Fatso,
you smell somethin'?
Yeah!
No, besides him.
Huh? Hey!
The idea, don't be afraid.
I'd like to make contact
with you, but just one
little thing, please.
Don't pop out from under a rug
or through a keyhole.
No spooking.
Let's get beyond that.
I would like to approach you.
Now, I'm coming
in the room now.
I'm in, in the room.
Can ya deal with that?
Dive!
Dive!
Dive! Huh?
Dad?
I'm gonna kill you,
your mama and all her
bridge-playin' friends.
You think you got it tough?
I got a face-lift. There was
one just like it underneath.
Hmph? Hmph?
Aaah!
Aah! Aah-aah!
Aaah!
Aah!
Hey, boys, we got
a closet case here.
Smell-o-gram.
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa!
All for one, and one for all!
Catch your pants
before they fall.
On the runway now,
we have Dr. James Harvey,
wearing smashing underwear.
Marky Mark he's not!
You are good.
Oh, stop. It's you.
Are we scary or what?
Aiii-ya!
Oh, and it looks as if
we're gonna go into
sudden death overtime.
Anybody for
a little shish ka-doc?
I am!
Hah!
Yeow!
Ha-ha!
Ha, ha!
Kitchie-koo!
Who do you think you are,
defiling our domicile, huh?
Dr. James... Harvey,
your... therapist.
Dad? Dad?
Are you okay?
Dad?
Dad?
Yaa!
Ha!
Get back.
What the hell
is that thing?
- Ha, ha!
-
Not the nose!
I'm bein' hosed!
No, no, no, no, no!
Th-Th-This sucks!
Are you okay?
Oh, I'm fine.
Why don't we go,
uh, regroup?
...
Morning!
Oh, no, please don't scream.
I-I promise I won't hurt you.
I'm a ghost, yes, I admit it.
But I'm a friendly ghost.
You have to trust me.
If you scream,
you'll wake up my uncles,
and they get awfully cranky.
I'm gonna
let you go now, okay?
You're so cold.
Yeah, but it saves
on the heating bill. Ha!
It's okay.
I can see
right through you.
Kind of happens
when you don't have any skin.
Wh... What are you made of?
Well, you know that
tingling feeling when
your foot falls asleep?
I think
I'm made of that.
Um, sunny-side up
kind of makes me yak.
No problem.
So, can you go invisible?
Ha, ha.
That one's easy.
It's fresh.
Go ahead.
I've never
done this before.
Me neither.
Can you hurt me?
N-No.
Can I hurt you?
No.
Cool.
Morning, Dr. Harvey.
Uh, some breakfast?
Uh, hmph. Uh...
Well, uh, yeah.
Honey? You okay?
Good.
How about a paper?
Sure.
Comin' at ya.
Well...
Hope you're hungry.

I love the smell
of fleshies in the morning.
I'm melting!
I'm melting!
Auntie Phlegm!
Auntie Phlegm!
What a world!
They're gone.
What happened?
They must have
crossed over.
-
-
Don't think so!
Guess again, bonebag!
Fellas, good morning.
Casper!
How dare you serve
these air-sucking intruders
before us.
I was just...
Give me...
My meal!
Okay, okay.
Mmm!
Mmm!
Mmm!
Ketchup, please.
Yum, yum! Yum!
You know what the problem is?
Casper's got no respect for us.
After all we've done
for the little glowworm.
Yeah. What the hell do you
think you're doin', bulbhead?
But we have company.
Oh, yeah?
Well, company loves misery.
Boom!
You guys are disgusting,
obnoxious creeps.
Thank you!
What's your problem?
He's just cleaning the floor.
Shut up, skinbag.
Piss off.
Take a hike.
Get a grave.
Honey!
You've got the school thing.
You don't wanna be late.
Drop dead!
-
- You'll have a lot of fun.
I know you will!
All right, guys.
We've obviously gotten off
on the wrong foot here.
Now, you know and I know
that you really shouldn't be here.
So I'll tell you what.
Why don't you go ahead
and finish your meal...
and we can meet in my office and
start the process of crossing over.
What do you say?
Well, it's your hour.
Watch it!
Hey, Amber!
Wait up!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Had that locker
last year.
Thanks.
My name's Vic.
Kat.
Coming, Vic?
Put a lid on it!
Ow!
Okay, I've got a couple
of announcements to make.
First,
the asbestos removal
from the gym is taking
longer than planned.
We're gonna have to push back
the Halloween dance
by a couple of months.
Well, as most of you know,
my parents have finished
the new boathouse.
So I'm sure it'd be no problem
having the party at my place.
That's done. Secondly,
we have a new student today.
I'd like you all to meet
Harvey Kathleen.
Would you like to come up
and say hi to everyone for me?
Harvey.
Um, well, it's Kat.
And, um, I guess
I just moved here...
And Friendship seems
like a pretty friendly place.
No. Whipstaff?
You've heard of it?
You actually live there?
But, I mean, I don't know...
Inside it's kind of cool.
Well, yeah,
if you drink blood.
Mr. Curtis, check this.
We're dead for
the Halloween dance, right?
This girl has a seriously,
seriously creepy house
with room to spare.
I thought we were
having the party
at my place.
Oh? Okay,
we'll take a vote.
Whoever wants the party
at my house, raise your hand.
Whipstaff?
Oh!
Johns Hopkins University?
Very impressive.
Not... this one.
Thank you, gentlemen.
Hey, what a dish, Doc!
The little missus perhaps?
Hubba, hubba!
Fatso, you animal.
She available, Doc?
She's my wife Amelia.
She's deceased.
Even better.
But... we're not here
to talk about me.
See? Now don't
you feel just awful?
I was just goofin'.
Don't be goofin' on Amelia.
She's as nice a person
as they come.
Wait a minute.
What are you saying?
You've actually seen her?
You think I'm blind?
Of course I've seen her.
Who hasn't?
You're not lookin' for her,
are ya, Doc?
Well, that's not really
the focus of our sessions
here, is it?
But as long as
you raised the issue,
you wouldn't have a way...
of contacting others
like yourselves, would you?
Hmm?
I didn't think so.
Now, that's not generally
allowed there, Doc.
Paperwork.
Red tape.
A holy mess, you know?
But for you?
I don't know.
Maybe we could work
somethin' out.
You keep that ghoul
Crittenden off our backs,
and I'd say we got
a deal, right, boys?
Mm-hmm!
Deal?
Deal.
Fatso, you know
where Amelia floats.
Go!
It's that easy, huh?
We got a ghost-to-ghost
network.
We share haunting stories.
We throw parties.
The parties are always
pretty dead, though.
That was fast.
Go.
Amelia?
My man!
Hmm.
Vic?
What are you do...
I mean, hi.
Can I come in?
Uh, no, no.
It's so much nicer
out here...
in the flesh...
fresh air.
So did ya ask your dad
about the party?
Y-Yeah, yeah. He, um,
kind of hit the ceiling,
but, um, I think
it's gonna be okay.
Cool. So, listen,
if you're not hooked up
with anybody else,
you wanna...
I don't know... hang out
with me at the party?
I'd love to.
All right, cool.
All right, see ya.
Okay.
Yes!
Well, did you ask her?
Yeah.
And she actually
believed you?
This really bites.
No, it's absolutely perfect.
Hey!
****
See? I'm a good dancer.
Whoa!
Don't need a costume.
I'm always the life
of the party.
Casper, listen.
I know you want to go.
Come on. We'd have
a great time together.
Casper, I have a date.
What's this Vic guy got
that I don't, huh?
A pulse?
Big fleshy deal.
A tan.
Very bad for your skin.
How about a reflection?
Okay, okay,
but can he do this?
Come with me if you want to live.
Casper?
Casper! No! Don't!
Casper, no!
Casper, no! No, no, no, no!
Casper, no. Oh, my God!
High! This is very high!
Casper! Casper!
Casper,
this is beautiful.
I come here every night.
Alone?
Mm-hmm.
What were you like
when you were alive?
I was... I was...
I don't remember.
You don't remember
anything from your life?
No.
So... Nothing?
No.
You don't remember
what school you went to,
how old you were?
Your favorite song?
What about your dad?
Hm-mmm.
Not even your mom?
Is that bad?
No.
It's just kind of sad.
I wonder why you
don't remember anything.
Hmm? Guess 'cause
when you're a ghost,
life doesn't matter
that much anymore.
So you forget.
Sometimes I worry
that I'm trying to forget.
Forget what?
My mom.
Just certain things.
The sound of her making
breakfast downstairs.
The way she put on
her lipstick...
so carefully.
I do remember...
she always used Ivory soap.
And when she'd hug me,
I'd breathe her in...
so deep.
And I remember,
before I'd go to sleep,
she'd whisper in my ear,
"Stardust in the eyes,
rosy cheeks and a happy girl
in the morning."
Casper?
Hmm?
If my mom's a ghost,
did she forget about me?
No, she'd
never forget you.
Kat?
Mm-hmm?
If I were alive, would you go to
the Halloween dance with me?
Mm-hmm.
Kat?
Hmm?
Can I keep you?
Mm-hmm.
Casper, close the window.
It's cold.
Hey, Dad!
Found your Visa card.
Where was it?
Um, in your wallet.
Maybe I could use it to buy
this perfect costume I saw
in a store downtown.
You always
made your costume.
No, Mom did.
I think I could come up
with something pretty good.
Why don't we roll you
in aluminum foil, and you
could go as a leftover?
Don't worry.
You always look cute.
I don't wanna look cute.
Cute's like when
you're nine years old...
and you've got papier-mache
around your head.
I want to look... nice.
Mm-hmm.
Like... Like date nice.
Really? Uh...
Honey, I think maybe
it's time that we...
...
It's a little late
for that, Dad.
- How late?
- Oh, don't worry.
Not that late.
Oh, good.
You know that I would love
to buy you everything you wanted.
But until Miss Crittenden
pays me, that thing
is pretty worthless.
Oh, well, that's okay.
Don't worry about it.
I'm sure I can come up
with something perfect
for the party.
**
**
** **
Dad, please,
whatever you do,
don't let those guys
crash it.
Oh, no, I think they're actually
getting to be quite focused now.
**
**
** ****
Late again, I see.
Could this be an expression
of hostility, Doc?
What? So silent?
No pearls of wisdom
today, Doc?
Come on, Doc.
Stay tough. Don't stop.
Come on, Doc.
Hang with us homeboys.
Hey, wait a second.
What?
You ain't thinkin'
about packin' it in now,
are ya, Doc?
We were just startin'
to have fun.
It ain't often we meet
a bonebag as amusin' as you.
Boys, this is serious.
I think the doc is havin'
one of them fleshy breakdowns.
Think we should break
into a song?
No!
It's time we gave the doc
our own prescription.
What about the party?
The party will have to wait.
Are you thinkin'
what I'm thinkin'?
Gentlemen?
Happy hour!
Happy hour!
Happy hour.
Whoop...
Yee-haw!

This is an outrage.
This is appalling.
You pay a man to get
the ghosts out of the house,
and what does he do?
He gets the ghosts
out of the house.
Exactly.
It's about time.
Ohh!
Look familiar?
This is...
This is...
And...
I know this.
I had five fingers.
I remember!
Hootie!
And wait!
Check it out.
Oh, wow.
It was my mom's.
Can I...
Go ahead.
Oh, Casper,
it's perfect.
You think I could wear it
to the party tonight?
Casper?
I begged and begged my dad
to get me this sled,
and he acted like
I couldn't even have it,
'cause I didn't know
how to ride it.
And then one morning,
I... I came down
for breakfast,
and there it was,
just for me.
For no reason at all.
I took it out,
went sledding all day,
and my dad said,
"That's enough,"
but I couldn't stop.
I was having so much fun.
Then it got late.
It got dark.
Got cold.
And I got sick.
My dad got sad.
What's it like to die?
Like being born.
Only backwards.
I remember I didn't go
where I was supposed to go.
I just stayed behind...
so my dad
wouldn't be lonely.
Is that your dad?
"McFadden claimed that he
was haunted by the ghost
of his dead son,
"and that he
invented a machine
to bring him back to life:
The Lazarus."
The Lazarus.
Ooh.
Hee-hee. Sorry.
I guess we'll have
to take the long way.
Hurry up!
Come on!
My dad hid it
so no one can find it,
but I remember where it is!
- Don't you know a shortcut?
- You got it.
Casper, no!
Wall... human?
Stop!
Go ahead.
Sit down.
I would hold on.
Why?
Casper!
Well?
What was that?
The "Up and At 'Em" machine.
My dad was a great inventor,
but he had a little trouble
getting going in the morning.
Didn't he ever hear
of caffeine?
-
- Dibs!
Wha...
What is all this?
My dad's lab.
Kind of a slob,
wasn't he?
Down here, he could do
whatever he wanted to.
But no matter how busy he was,
he would drop everything
to play pirates with me.
Aye, matey.
Buccaneers and buried gold.
Whipstaff doth a treasure hold.
Oh!
Come on.
Dibs!
Oh!
So where's this
Lazarus thing?
Down there?
Huh. That's useful.
Oh, I know there's a way
to get it going.
I just can't...
What about that?
That?
Nah. That's the vault.
Wait!
It's gotta be this!
Hey, I did it!
Lazarus!
Ah. Ooh. Ouch.
What is this?
Careful!
That's what makes
the whole thing work.
Kind of an instant
primordial soup mix.
It's what brings ghosts
back to life.
Just enough for one.
- Pull the lever.
- Which one?
I don't know.
Try one.
- Casper?
- I'm gonna be alive.
Oh, man, how am I
gonna do this?
I couldn't even get
my Easy Bake oven to work.
Okay.
Casper?
Am I alive?
Dibs, do you have any idea
what this means?
Yes!
No.
You don't have to be scared
of death anymore.
One minute you'll be a ghost;
next, you're back on your feet,
free to come and go
as you please.
Hell, you could even
fly through...
Walls.
Thick walls.
Thick as steel.
Certainly could get to
whatever's behind those walls.
Like a, a treasure,
for example?
And snap, crackle, pop:
You're back alive
and on your way
to the Riviera.
If you were a ghost.
If you were.
- If you would just...
-
Whoa.
Wa-a-a-a!
-
-
Dibs, you're takin' this
way too personally.
Please!
Carrigan!
Are you
a ghost yet?
Carrigan!
What a tragic waste.
She had my favorite sunglasses.
Wha...

Hey, this Dr. Harvey's got
a lot of spirit, you know
what I'm sayin'?
Yeah, but he's got
his whole miserable
life ahead of him.
So we could do him a favor
and put him out of his misery.
Yeah. Hey,
good idea.
We been the ghostly trio
long enough.
Time to make it a...
quartet!
****
****
Could I just
say something here?
- And get a little personal?
-  Oh, yeah.
You know how it is. Okay.
Well, I just
got to tell you...
you guys remind me
of what it's like to
hang out with the boys.
I mean, you are absolutely
there for each other.
**... **
I mean, you look life
right in the face.
You say, "I'm a ghost.
I don't need you. Mmm."
You know what? I'm gonna
tell that Miss Critten Picken...
Uh, Crichton Critten...
Crut...
I'm gonna tell that lady
you aren't goin' anywhere.
It's your house.
You're haunting it.
Possession is
nine-tenths of the law.
No.
No.
No.
Yes.
No.
No.
No.
Yes.
Aww.
Aww.
I didn't think so
at first, but...
you guys are great.
I love you... guys.
Hey. Hey!
Eeow!
Eeeeee!
Ohh!
Hey.
Noooo.
Heh-heh.
Oof!
What a sweetheart.
I can't croak him now.
Me neither.
No way.
All right, boys!
The night is young.
Mm-hmm.
We are gonna clean out
every bar this town has got.
Uh-uh-uh.
We're gonna booze it
until we lose it.
Come on.
Come on.
Think my ears
just popped.
- My treasure!
- You mean  treasure.
Uhhh.
Miss Crittenden?
In the flesh.
Well, in a couple of minutes.
-
-
Dibs! What are you doing?
This is no time to shave.
Helping you, remember?
Remember what?
This!
You stole that.
That's Casper's.
So sue me. Dibs!
The capsule! Now!
Coming.
I'm coming, okay?
Here. Jump in.
Oh!
Oy.
Perfect.
- We're here.
- Uh, okay.
Hi. Come on in.
This is the room.
Um, stay together;
you'll be safe.
And I'll be right back.
Amber, do we
have to do this?
Hey, she wants a Halloween party,
she's gonna get a Halloween party.
Hey, that's
my treasure!
Stay back!
Keep away from me.
Casper!
Don't come near me,
you spiteful spook, or I'll
knock you into the next world.
Come on.
Let's go.
* Ta-da *
Hey, "poppin' fresh,"
it's  turn in the oven.
Dibs! Get this thing cooking,
you blasted little worm you!
Ah... Carrigan.
How kind of you to drop in.
if there's one thing I've
learned from you, it's:
Always kick 'em
when they're down.
And, baby,
you're six feet under.
Oh, what a shame.
Sorry, sweetheart.
We're through.
I am not gonna
forget this, you ungrateful,
lousy little worm you.
Oh, you can haunt me
all you want,
but it's gonna be
in a great big,
expensive house...
with lovely
purple wallpaper...
and great big
green carpets...
and a little dog
called Carrigan...
a bitch just like you.
I got the power.
I got the treasure.
And you have
a flight to catch.
Any other takers?
No. But aren't you
forgetting something?
What?
Your unfinished
business.
- My what?
- You know,
unfinished business.
All ghosts have unfinished business.
That's why they don't cross over.
Unfinished business?
I have no unfinished business.
I have my treasure, my mansion.
I have everything.
I'm just perfect.
I have unfinished business,
lots of unfinished business.
I-I'm not ready
to cross over yet.
Wait! You tricked me,
you rotten little brats!
My treasure!
A ball?
That's your treasure?
Are you kidding? It's
autographed by Duke Snyder,
the Brooklyn Dodgers.
My favorite player.
Casper, it's time.
Whoooaaa-ehhhh-whoo-ohhh!
Ooh.
Dad?
No! What have you
done to him?
Nothin'. He's just
a little... dead.
I'm free!
I've never felt
so good in my life.
I can fly-y-y-eee!
Rookie.
Stinkie,
work with him.
Dad?
Yeah.
Hey!
Who's the girl?
Dad, it's me.
I-It's Kat.
Kat. Kat?
- Kat Ballou.
- Katatonic.
Katastrophic.
Kreplach soup.
- Flesh flood alert.
- Dad?
Don't you remember?
Oh, yeah!
I remember!
No!
Oh.
Uh-oh.
Uh-oh.
Uh-oh.
Oh, Kat!
Oh, sweetheart.
Oh, what have I done?
I... Oh, Kat.
Don't cry. I...
Oh, please.
Come on, Dr. Harvey.
You need this
more than I do.
Casper.
This is the way
it's gotta be.
-
-
Dad?
Oh, Kat!
Oh! Ohh, Kat.
Aww. Hey.
Oh, that felt like
the strangest dream.
I... I thought we
almost lost each other
for a minute there.
Oh, Bucket.
**
Your party started
without you.
Your date's
probably waiting.
Maybe we should
get going.
Uh...
where are we?
**
Well, go ahead.
What about you?
Hey, this is your party.
Go do your thing.
Go hang.
Or chill or kick it or
whatever you call it.
I think you got
a date out there.
Thanks, Dad.
****
I hope no one saw that.
Hold still!
I'm trying.
Could you weigh any more?
Just shut up and
get your head down.
Oh, my... Oh,
you gotta see this.
People are gonna freak.
Let me see.
Cool.
Thank you.
-
-
Yeah!
You're...
Uh-huh.
You're...
That's right.
Kat's mom?
Are... Are you
an angel?
That was a very noble thing
you did tonight, Casper.
I know Kat
will never forget it.
She needs her father.
And I know yours
will never forget it either.
You fulfilled
his greatest dream, Casper,
and I know he is
very, very proud of you.
And for what you've done,
I'm giving you your dream
in return.
it's just for tonight.
Sort of a Cinderella deal.
- So I have
until midnight?
- 10:00.
Hey, Cinderella
got until midnight.
Cinderella wasn't 12 years old.

I told you
I was a good dancer.
Can I keep you?
Casper?
Hello, James.
Amelia.
It's all right.
It's just me.
I...
I thought I'd have
a hundred things
to say when I...
How?
Let's just say you know
three crazy ghosts
who kept their word.
James, I know you've
been searching for me.
But there's something
you have to understand.
You and Kat loved me
so well when I was alive...
that I have no
unfinished business.
Please don't
let me be yours.
But, Amelia,
I don't...
I don't really know
what I'm doing.
What parent does?
James, Kat is
growing up beautifully
because of you.
No wonder
I miss you so much.
Just a couple things,
though.
Don't pick up the extension
every time she gets a phone call.
French fries
are not a breakfast food.
And don't ask her
to wear a T-shirt...
under her...
Ah, under her bathing suit.
I know.
Our daughter is...
A teenager.
A teenager.
Wait.
Where are you going?
Where I can watch over
both of you...
until we're
together again.
- Good-bye, James.
-
Casper?
Uh, ha. Boo?
Not bad for
my first party, huh?
Couldn't have
been better.
It ain't over yet.
Boys!
