MAN:  And now,
it's time for a breakdown.
Mmm, mmm, mmm, yeah...
Man, I told you Robbie
Wheirdicht showers here
during first period.
Why doesn't he just shower at
home like a normal person?
Look at him. Does anything
about that look normal to you?
You know, he's actually
a pretty good dancer.
Let's wreck him.
TREVOR: Hey, Weird Dick!
Come on.
Finally, young ladies
and young gentlemen,
it is my pleasure to
announce that the winner
of the National High School
Student of the Year Award
is none other than your very own
two-time student
body president,
the captain of Central High's
All Valley track team,
president of the drama club
and the senior voted
"Most Likely to Succeed."
I gotta tell you folks, after
he is my favorite student.
I wish he were my son
if I were medically able
to have children.
He's everybody's
favorite all-around guy...
Calvin "The Golden Jet"
Joyner! Come on!
ALL:  Golden Jet!
Golden Jet! Golden Jet!
Oh, my goodness.
Wow. Wow, guys.
Hey! How about a hand
for Principal Kent, huh?
Huh?
Honestly, if my mom was into
white guys, it would be you.
I know it would, okay?
Well, as we all know,
this is our last assembly
which means this is the last
time, in front of you guys
that I'll be able to tell
the most beautiful girl in the world...
I'm talking about you, Maggie Johnson,
that I love you.
I love you, baby. I do.
I'm gonna put it in my pocket.
I'll save it.
All right, guys.
We're seniors now.
And once we get those diplomas,
the decisions that we make
after that are all up to us.
I don't know what path
life is gonna take me on.
But I can promise you all this...
That I, for one, will push myself
at every stage, at every step.
So, I got one question to ask.
I got one question for the
graduating class of 1996
and that's "Will you..."
Check out my Weird Dick!
Hey. Here, here man.
Thank you.
Well, there's no coming back from that.
Calvin Joyner, everybody,
voted "Most Likely
to Succeed."
ALL:  Golden Jet!
Golden Jet! Golden Jet!
Hey. Check it.
What is the matter with you? What?
What do you mean, "What"?
Why do you think I wanna see that?
Well, no, I'm working on
a new sexting app.
Okay. It's kind of like
Instagram, right?
But, instead of filters,
it just makes your junk look huge.
Like, three to six inches
bigger. It's amazing.
It's called "Junk Mail."
Clever, right?
You know, right now, this
little walk right here?
I kinda want to just take
it away from my life.
Why are you all cranky-pants
this morning, huh?
Oh. It's because Ethan got
promoted instead of you?
Ethan got promoted?
Youngest senior associate
in the history of the firm.
Corner office, the whole deal.
Didn't he used to be your assistant?
Who cares! Hey, you should
come to lunch with us.
We're gonna be
celebrating his pro-mosh!
It'll probably be good for
you to kiss the ring a bit.
"Kiss the ring a bit"?
Hey, you play your chessboard
however you like, okay?
Me, lunch today? I'm gonna
French kiss that thing.
Aah...
I can't. I'm taking my wife
to lunch today, so...
All right.
Bummer for you.
* 'Cause we gonna get hyphy!
* We gonna get hyphy!
Right?
Can you just get out of my face?
Blessed.
To a guy I not only
consider my coworker,
but my personal friend.
To Ethan!
Cheers!
Do you wanna move tables?
I know this kind of sucks.
No, no. It doesn't suck.
Hey, if I wanted to get
one of those ice teas
but I want most of it to be bourbon...
What is that called?
Okay. How about
we change the topic
to something a little more fun?
Anything else, please.
Oh, how about...
This is the dress that I'm
thinking about wearing.
CALVIN: Oh!
Honey, I want every single girl
to be jealous tomorrow night.
Oh.
What?
I just...
I just don't want to go.
Calvin, it's our 20-year
high school reunion.
I'm not gonna go without you.
We agreed we were going.
I RSVP'd for us.
I just changed my mind.
That's all.
Okay. I see.
You're disappointed about the promotion.
I get it.
This is not about the promotion.
Okay, this has to do with me not
wanting to spend my Friday night
answering the "What are
you doing now?" question.
That's what I'll get
all night. "Hey, Calvin,
"what are you doing now?"
"I'm an accountant."
"An accountant? Really?
"I thought you would
be the governor, man.
"Wait a minute. Didn't you get
voted "'Most Likely to Succeed'?
"I guess we
missed that one."
Is this why you've been
so weird and moody, lately?
'Cause you're freaking out
about the reunion?
No.
And what's the matter
with being an accountant?
You love your job.
No, you love your job.
I'm good at my job.
It's not the same thing.
Honey, that's not fair.
You're a partner at your firm.
I work in a building with a giant,
inflatable gorilla out in front of it.
Look, I don't want to be the
guy that peaked in high school
and, after he peaked,
his life went like this...
I don't know the sound
that that thing makes,
but you know what I'm trying to do.
I'm the guy that went down, okay?
Yeah.
Then my life
down here became a disappointment.
That's what I'll be.
Wow.
What?
I had no idea that your life with me
was such a soundless,
crashing disappointment!
Don't do that.
That's not... Don't do that.
That's the sound.
You want to know the sound
I'm about to make right now?
The sound of me not going.
That's the sound I'm making.
I'm not going.
Yeah.
Mmm-mmm-mmm.
No.
Not going to that.
Bob Stone?
Okay.
Hello?
Hey.
Girl, you scared me.
I did? Yes. I thought that you were...
I just... On the...
Never mind.
Hey, I'm glad you called.
I'm sorry about lunch today.
I'm an idiot, babe.
I don't even know what's
going on with me right now.
I really don't.
Yeah?
Actually, honey,
that's what I was calling
to talk to you about.
Look, honey, I think
that we should see someone.
What do you mean, "Someone"?
What do you mean?
See someone, like a therapist.
Uh, honey, black people
don't go to therapy.
We go to barbershops.
That's where we talk out our problems.
Or we watch the movie Barbershop.
One or the other.
Look, my parents were really unhappy
for a long time
before they got divorced.
And maybe if they saw someone sooner,
they would still be married.
I just want to nip this thing
in the bud, whatever it is.
I don't want to end up like my parents.
Wassup?
Wassup?
MAGGIE: Please, just do it
for me, if not for you.
CALVIN: All right. Uh...
When... When do you
want to do it?
MAGGIE: Really?
The doctor said
he could see us at 6:00 p.m.
Um...
Yeah. Yeah,
is that a problem?
Holy shit!
Robbie Wheirdicht.
Calvin, honey? Hello?
Um, yeah.
I can't. I already made plans
for tonight, baby.
MAGGIE: Plans with who?
With Bob Stone.
Who's Bob Stone? That
sounds like a fake name.
No, no. Do you remember Robbie
Wheirdicht, from high school?
No.
The guy who got beaten up by
Trisha Demarco at homecoming?
No.
The kid that tried to rap along to
Coolio's "1,2,3,4" at the talent show
but then he kinda lost
his way, midway through
so he just started bopping his
head, and he stood there?
No. Nothing.
The guy who got thrown out the gym,
butt-ass-naked,
senior year?
Oh, my God, yeah!
Why wouldn't you start with that?
Because I thought that was kind of mean.
I don't know.
He never came back
to school after that, right?
Like, not for finals
or graduation or anything.
I'm not sure. I don't
know if he did or not,
but he changed his name to "Bob Stone"
and apparently he's in town
for the high school reunion.
He wants to go to dinner tonight,
and I kinda
already said "yes."
Okay.
If you want me to cancel,
I will. You know?
If that's what you want, I don't mind.
Mmm-mmm. I mean, it's a
little weird, but whatever.
I'll just see if the doctor
can fit us in tomorrow.
How about at lunch time?
Okay. All right, fine.
Okay, good. I love you.
I love you, too,
babe. I do.
Oh, my...
MAGGIE: What is that?
Okay.
Calvin? Are you...
Love you. Bye-bye.
No!
Stop, stop!
Hey, man. I...
Hey! What's up, guys?
Congratulations on that promotion, man.
It's quite the thing.
Thank you. Hey, that's
not work appropriate.
Yup.
Not cool, man. Not cool.
Dude, forward that to me.
MAN 1: For real man,
seriously?
MAN 2: Yeah. Watch it, punk.
Excuse you, too.
My man!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Calvin. It's me, Bob.
Sorry, what?
Do I know you?
Do you know...
Robbie Wheirdicht from high school!
Are you kidding? What?
Wait, you're Robbie Wheirdicht?
Yeah!
God, man, look at you! You've
lost, like, 200 pounds!
I see you gained it back in muscle.
Oh, my God!
You look great!
No, you look great!
Stop it.
No, you haven't changed
since high school, dude!
No, you're just sexy as dick right now.
You don't look somebody
in the eyes and say that.
Hey, let's get hammered.
I got an early day at work,
so I'll probably...
No, come on, I'm buying!
Oh, shit.
Mmm.
I'm sorry, man.
I am blown away right now.
Dude, you used to be Fat Robbie.
Look at you!
This is like a total transformation.
You look like Hercules or somebody.
What did you do?
Come on, give it to me.
I didn't do much, really.
Stop it.
All right. Well, I just did one thing.
Come on, I need to know.
I worked out
six hours a day, every day,
for the last 20 years straight.
I mean, anybody can do it, right?
Yeah.
Yeah. You know,
I've gotten into hot yoga.
I started doing some sessions.
Uh-huh.
Nice unicorn, man.
Oh, yeah,
I'm big-time into 'corns.
So magical, right?
You know, they're the most
lethal animal on the planet.
Here you go.
Guys, my name's Lexi.
Just let me know if you need anything.
Okay.
I mean, like, anything at all.
Okie-dokie.
You're funny. Do you
ever, like, Snapchat?
Oh, no. You know...
I wasn't talking to you.
No, no, no.
I don't do that.
I'm just catching up with an
old friend from high school.
Aw. You're so sweet.
I think unicorns are sexy, too.
That must happen to you
all the time, right?
Ah, nah.
I mean, all that
meaningless sex is just...
It's not my bag anymore, CJ.
Oh.
No, now, I'm looking for more
of an emotional connection.
The next woman I lay with,
she's gonna be beautiful on the inside,
just as much as she is on the outside.
Hey, wait.
Whatever happened
to that girl that you liked
in high school?
Oh, God, man.
The "Doogie Howser" girl.
She was 14, but somehow
she was a senior.
She wore a cape.
Darla McGuckian.
Darla McGuckian.
"Yucky Gucky."
Didn't she have
a lazy eye or something?
Two of 'em.
Right.
Hey, but listen, I don't
wanna talk about me.
I wanna talk about you.
I heard that you and
Maggie Johnson got hitched.
Yeah, man, right after college.
Wow! The prettiest girl
in school,
and the coolest guy in school!
Oh, man, I got lucky.
I mean, you guys are like
a power couple, dude!
No, no.
Yes!
You're like Taylor Swift
and whoever she's dating right now.
Power.
Uh... Thanks!
Yeah. You guys got kids?
No. No kids yet.
We planned on it after college,
but Maggie went to law school,
I kept changing jobs.
You know, having kids just
isn't in our cards right now.
Not at this point, that's all.
Oh, okay.
Yeah.
Oh, I got an idea.
Let's do shots!
No!
I'm sorry for saying
it like that, but no.
I haven't had shots
in almost 10 years, man.
What? Come on, we have to!
We're celebrating!
Celebrating what?
Celebrating that I'm hanging with
the coolest kid in high school.
Oh, stop it.
Calvin Joyner!
The Golden Jet.
You got to be
shitting me. Wow!
I haven't... God!
It's been forever
since I heard that, man!
I'll do one.
All right!
One shot.
Shots!
No. One shot.
Just one, okay?
Bob, it's been a while.
Oh, shit! You remember this?
This was the jammy-jam!
What's that?
Is that a fanny pack, Bob?
Hell, yeah!
Dude, you want one?
No, it's okay.
I got two at home.
I'll hook you up.
Leather pack for The Jet.
Fanny!
Shit.
What the hell did I get myself into?
Mmm. Mmm-mmm-mmm.
Whoa! Hey, sir, somebody's
actually sitting there.
Yeah, someone was.
No! Hey, man!
Hey, you don't see
the sweatshirt right here?
Man, somebody's sitting here.
Move your meat,
lose your seat.
Dude, you don't have
to be a dick about it.
Somebody's sitting in the chair.
Bro, are you seriously
gonna go there, bro?
'Cause there's only one way back, bro.
Through intensive care, bro.
Was that the last "bro"?
'Cause if it was, then I'll talk.
That supposed to be funny?
Hey, now!
What's the rumpus?
CALVIN: You know...
There's no problem, man.
Let's just go to another table.
Get your jacket.
Let's go.
No, we're not gonna go anywhere.
Listen to your pussy friend.
Those gym muscles
aren't scaring anybody, pal.
Oh, these?
Let's just go. It's okay.
No, we're not gonna go.
This man insulted you.
And we're not gonna leave
until he apologizes.
It's okay.
Hey, we got a problem here?
No, no. Yeah, we got a big problem.
Your friend, here,
really insulted my friend
and he needs to apologize.
I don't think he does.
CALVIN: He doesn't.
Whoa! You know what, man?
I think this whole situation's
getting a little out of control.
I can fix this whole thing.
I'll order some nachos.
The "Explosions."
It's got four cheeses!
Let's eat 'em together.
You know what?
You take them.
Let's go.
Nah. We're not
going anywhere, Jet.
This whole thing
will be over in a jiff.
Hey, how about this?
Why don't you and your boyfriend
apologize to Big Rick here
and then go jerk each other
in the parking lot?
That's a lot...
Yeah. You're right, CJ.
That's a lot of homophobia
coming out of a very angry man.
You need to go get that looked
at by a trained professional.
But, since you have
escalated this whole scenario
by bringing what I can only assume
is an unlicensed firearm
into this public place,
endangering the lives of
all these innocent people,
I can no longer, in good
conscience, walk away
and jerk anyone off in the parking lot.
I'm afraid we ain't going anywhere.
It's time for you
to get out of here, pal.
CALVIN: Whoa, whoa, whoa.
There's four of us, tough guy.
Yeah. I got that.
All right. Well, before
this whole thing goes down,
you should know one thing about me.
What's that?
I don't like bullies.
Let's go, Jet.
Yes.
Oh, my God!
I hope he's Catholic.
Oh, my God!
What the hell was that?
Bob, that was amazing! I've
never seen anything like that!
You took the one guy,
you hit him like this.
He couldn't breathe.
I sat there, I'm looking at him...
You talkin' to him like,
"I don't like bullies."
I was like, "That's not a
good line." But it was!
I didn't even know you could fight!
You had a unicorn shirt, a fanny pack,
and it totally worked!
You were like Jason Bourne,
man, but with jorts!
How did you do that? Where'd
you learn that stuff?
I took a couple classes at work.
I hope I didn't go too far.
I'm sorry about ruining the night, Jet.
Ruin my night? No! It was the
coolest thing ever, man!
Really?
Yes!
To see my boy go in and whoop ass
on those idiots back there.
Dude, that was amazing!
Wait, we're boys?
Yeah, we boys.
Wow. I...
Never had a boy.
That's awesome! Come here!
Oh, wait.
Stop. What's going on, man?
I'm a hugger!
What're you doing?
Hey! I got an idea.
Let's roll. Here's my bike.
Wait. That's your bike?
Yeah. Kawasaki 800!
I know what the bike is.
I had the same bike
in high school, man.
You still ride?
No, man.
I haven't ridden a bike in years!
Oh, come on, let's roll.
Where?
Where you trying to go?
I know the perfect spot.
Come on, Jet.
You know, why not?
Why not?
After this... Yeah, okay!
BOB: Let's roll.
CALVIN: Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey, Bob!
Slow, slow, slow!
Bob, hey, hey!
God, this is so crazy, man.
This brings back so many memories.
BOB: I don't know, CJ.
I mean, high school
wasn't easy for me, man.
I don't know if you know this,
but I didn't have
many friends back then.
What?
Really?
No.
I don't know why I thought...
True story.
Oh.
Man, I thought high school was
gonna be like Sixteen Candles
and I was gonna be like Molly Ringwald.
Sure, things were
difficult in the beginning,
but then, by the end,
everything worked out.
And Jake Ryan picked her up
in that red Porsche.
What-what?
You ever see that movie?
I'm black, so I don't know the...
Oh. You gotta
see it, dude.
Total classic. It's my
favorite all-time movie.
Then I realized high school
was nothing like Sixteen Candles.
And I'll never be like Molly Ringwald.
Yeah, well, depends on who you ask.
That's the thing.
For me, I...
What's going on?
Oh, wow.
Hey, man, I just wanna say
that I'm really sorry
about what Trevor and those
guys did to you back then.
No biggie. I don't even
think about it anymore. No.
Okay, good.
Yeah. Here's the secret.
You know what I did, Jet?
I took all that stuff and
I balled it up real tight
and then I shoved it way down deep.
And I just pretty much ignore it.
You know, that sounds
really unhealthy, Bob.
Hey, I gotta tell you.
You were the only one
who helped me out that day.
In the gym?
Remember that?
And you gave me your lettermans jacket!
Hey, not for nothing,
but I never got that jacket back, man.
Huh! Really?
Strange.
Hey, but, listen,
I just wanna thank you
for what you did for me that day.
That was really cool of you, Jet.
Stop, man. It was the right
thing to do, you know?
You wanna hear something weird?
What?
I have not been naked since that day.
I mean, not in front of anyone.
Never.
So, you're telling me
that for the last 20 years,
you've never been seen
in your birthday suit?
What about when you have sex?
I keep it pitch-black,
just like Vin Diesel.
Hey, Bob, look, if you
ever wanna talk, I'm here.
So I don't mind, you know?
I don't mind at all, if you wanna...
What?
Whoa. This is all our stuff
from our year!
Yeah. Must be getting ready
for the reunion tomorrow night.
Come on, man.
Let's get out of here.
What? No! "Get out..."
Look, you're all over this!
Look at this. Basketball,
baseball, cross country.
Hamlet.
Prom King.
There's Darla McGuckian.
Synchronized swimming, that's so sexy.
This is like the Guinness Book
of Golden Jet Records right there.
I see that.
To be honest with you, I don't
even recognize this guy anymore.
This guy, here, he was gonna...
He was gonna conquer the world.
If 18-year-old me
could see me now,
he'd probably think
I was a total loser.
What? That's crazy talk!
You're The Golden Jet, dude! Stop.
Stop, Bob. Spare me
with The Golden Jet shit.
I'm not The Golden Jet, man.
I'm an accountant.
That's my reality.
I just thought I was
meant for more, you know?
My life would be something special.
You know how they say every man
is the hero of his own story?
Was that in Twilight?
No, I don't think
that's where it's from.
But those books are cool,
right? Vampires!
Oh, and there's a wolf-boy.
I'm not... I'm not talking
about Twilight, Bob, okay?
I'm talking about the fact
that I don't feel like
I'm the hero
of my own story. That's...
How are you not the hero
of your own story?
No one else can be!
Yo, CJ, I gotta be
honest with you, man.
I mean, all this talk
about Calvin Joyner
not feeling like he's a hero...
That's crazy talk, man.
No. No, it's not.
You were the best thing
about high school.
I'll always believe in you.
Yo, do you remember those
backflips you used to do?
The crowd would go crazy!
I was there, too.
I was, like,
"What? How's he do that?"
How did you do that?
I don't know.
I just did it, man.
Exactly.
So, do it now.
No, no. You're crazy! No.
What's that?
What're you talking about?
What's what?
Golden Jet!
No, stop it.
Golden Jet!
Okay, stop it!
Golden Jet!
All right.
Golden Jet!
I'm not gonna stop until
you do The Golden Jet flip!
Golden Jet!
All right, everybody,
settle down. Settle down!
If the crowd wants a Golden Jet flip,
then they gonna get a Golden Jet flip.
You go, girl!
Oh, God!
That was so close, Jet.
Here, buddy. Come on.
They must have just waxed these floors.
That was definitely a first, man.
Oh, man, I am beat.
Oh.
Hey, Jet!
Man, I had a great time tonight.
Whoa.
You know what? I had a
good time, too, man.
I feel like I needed this, you know?
Yeah. Yeah. Me, too!
Thank you.
My pleasure, amigo.
Anytime.
Hey, if there's ever anything I can
do for you, just say the word.
Wow. You really mean that?
Yeah.
I wasn't gonna bring it up,
but I might as well.
Lately, I've been having this problem
with my payroll account.
And, um...
It's all screwed up, somehow.
You know, I was overseas working
for a while before I got fired.
So, it's kinda like
a forensic international account thingy
which, I think, is kind
of your specialty, right?
Um...
Yeah, no, it is. I'll take
a look at that for you.
You would?
You would do that for me?
I've got the login info,
if you wanna crack open your computer,
we can do this!
Oh, you mean now?
That's awesome! Yeah!
Okay.
Look at this!
Hey, Bob...
Whoa!
Bob, you gotta keep your voice down!
Maggie's sleeping.
Wow.
This is a pretty serious international
account dossier you've got here.
Right? I just want
to make sure
everything was hunky-dory.
Going to your router.
Now you're talking to me.
Bingo.
I'm in.
Oh. That's great, Jet.
Thank you, man!
I mean, just looking
at it first-hand,
it kinda looks like it's a bunch
of off-shore
escrow accounts.
These have been backwashed
into a series of domestic
dummy accounts for some reason.
I mean, the logs are all crazy, too.
You have China,
Syria, Iran.
This is an auction site, Bob!
These are bids.
All of these.
This is hundreds of millions of
dollars in bids, right here.
And judging by this clock, here,
it says it's all gonna end tomorrow.
Whoa! What the hell?
Why?
What did...
Oh! I'm sorry, Jet!
Bob!
Jet, I'm so sorry!
Oh, man.
I'm all thumbs.
It's my computer!
I'm sorry.
No! Please, Bob.
I'm sorry, Jet.
Leave it. I got it.
It's fine, Bob.
It's fine. Just leave it.
The worst!
God!
Hey! What the hell
was that on that site?
That didn't have anything
to do with payroll.
I don't know. I've never
seen that before.
That was crazy.
Let's figure it out tomorrow
when we're bright-eyed
and bushy-tailed.
What do you say, CJ?
I am beat.
Hey, do you mind if I crash here?
Um...
No.
Let me go grab some blankets.
Hey, thanks for the jammies, Jet.
Okay, well, you can keep those.
Those are...
Those are officially yours.
Yeah.
All right.
Oh.
You gonna sleep with your fanny pack.
Golden Jet!
Yeah, it's my baby.
You, uh, need anything else?
You're okay?
I can't believe I'm having a sleepover
at Calvin Joyner's house right now.
This is blowing my mind!
Okay.
Uh, good night, Bob.
Good night, Jet.
Me?
Yeah, you.
What the hell?
One second.
Hold on.
Uh, may I help you?
Mr. Joyner,
my name is Pamela Harris,
I'm with the Central
Intelligence Agency.
Have you had any contact with this man?
Uh, yeah, he's on my...
He's on my couch sleeping.
Target's in the house.
What's going on? Hey!
Excuse me. Excuse me!
AGENT STAN:
Target's fled.
Shit.
Target's on the move.
Excuse me! What...
Hello, hey! Excuse me!
And voice chatter in the vicinity.
CALVIN: Hello! Excuse me!
If he's in the wind again, it's
gonna be your ass. Go now.
Hello! Alert Langley,
asset uncontained.
Excuse me!
Can I help you?
Hello!
It's my house.
Is something going on?
Well, Mr. Joyner,
your sleepover buddy, Robert Wheirdicht
is wanted for murder and treason
and is presently in possession
of highly classified state secrets
which he intends to sell
to our enemies.
You mind?
Creamer's in the fridge.
What?
I don't need it.
What I do need is information.
I need you to tell me
everything and anything
about your contact with Agent Stone.
Agent Stone?
Bob, your friend Bob.
Come on.
Stay with me, please.
Okay, I think
there's a misunderstanding.
No. No, he is not
my friend.
Then why did he list you
as his emergency contact
in all his personnel forms?
I'm sorry... He what?
Bob Stone has no siblings, or parents,
or family of any kind.
You are the only person
he listed in his personal references.
Oh...
That's crazy, all right?
I barely even know the guy.
Then, why was he sleeping
on your couch?
Because we went out
and had drinks last night.
Oh, so you went out drinking
with your non-friend?
Okay.
All right, let's...
You're not...
Time out.
I'm pressing the time out button.
Okay? You guys barged
in my house.
I pay my taxes.
So you're not gonna come here
and treat me like I'm the enemy, okay?
That's the first thing.
Now, if you want to get into facts...
You wanna talk about facts?
This is Facebook's fault.
He sent me a friend request.
That's how this whole thing started.
And you accepted?
Don't do that.
Don't do that to me.
You give me a second. Okay?
Don't fire back like that.
First of all, fuck Mark
Zuckerberg, all right?
Now, I accepted
because it was Facebook.
And it's rude when you don't accept it
and I don't know if
the person on the other end
can see me not accept it.
That's why I accepted.
Are you nervous,
Mr. Joyner?
Is it hot?
Are you getting hot?
Because I'm getting hot.
I'm not gonna take off my jacket
because that makes me look guilty.
And that's what
you guys look for. Hmm?
Is this what a guilty man would do?
Look how comfortable I am.
Mr. Joyner,
your friend Bob Stone
is a dangerous psychotic.
You're lucky to be alive.
Okay, listen to me.
This man is not, I repeat to you,
he is not, not, my friend!
Zero allegiance.
All right, Mr. Joyner.
Prove it.
Yeah, well, I need a second.
You gotta step outside.
I gotta take a shit.
This is a lot.
I got to go.
Just give me a second, man!
I'll be waiting.
Jesus Christ!
All teams be advised,
we're Oscar Mike with the bait.
I'm sorry, did you just
call me "the bait"?
No.
Yeah, you did.
She just called me the bait.
Why am I the bait?
No, that doesn't sound like
something I'd ever say.
You just said it.
What's going on here?
Sir, I'm gonna need you to step aside.
This is a matter of national security.
Yeah, right!
I love it.
What is this?
Like a strippergram thing
to suck up to Ethan?
Gotta love strippers.
So dirty.
Show us your tits!
Show us your tits!
Hey, let's see some titty!
This you?
Yeah, right here.
You did this to yourself.
Small.
Yeah.
Calvin Joyner, Accounting.
Hello? Calvin Joyner,
Accounting.
BOB: Calvin?
It's Bob! It's Bob!
Act natural.
BOB: Calvin. Is that you?
Are you there?
Well, hey. Well, yeah.
Yeah, wassup?
What up, Bobby-o?
Are you quite well?
I'm in big trouble.
Oh, God! I screwed up.
I screwed up big time.
We gotta talk.
Can you meet me?
Sure. Yeah. Where?
Where do you want me to meet you?
I'm in the stairwell of your
building, two flights down.
Stairwell?
Hurry!
He's in the stairwell, two flights down!
Move, move!
Alert Charlie team.
Hold on. What's going on?
Am I safe here?
As long as Bob Stone is in
the building, no one's safe.
Get back in your office now!
Okay!
Good news is we heard her, guys.
So, everybody,
let's all just stay calm.
As long as...
As long... Shit!
What the hell is going on?
Relax.
Hey.
Great job at getting
them out of here, Jet.
Oh, Bob!
That's teamwork!
Wait! How did you...
What did you just do?
It's a tradecraft, buddy.
Spoiler alert...
I'm in the CIA.
Oh, no shit!
Hey, hey! What're you
doing with my phone?
You about to turn my phone
into a bomb, aren't you?
I've seen Homeland.
So I know what they do.
Homeland? No,
I'm ordering us an Uber.
Six minutes.
That's kinda tight.
I'm gonna need your tie.
You're gonna... No!
Your necktie, take it off. No,
I'm not taking my tie off!
Come on, Jet!
Don't do that. Don't do that.
That's good.
Save it, save it, save it.
Save it, Jet.
Fine, take it, take it.
There we go, just right over here.
You can have it.
Okay, that...
Listen to me. Listen.
Stop. Stop!
I need to know what is
happening, right now.
Okay, okay. You know what?
Moving too fast.
Bottom line, are you in or you out?
What are you...
In or out of what?
Mmm-mmm. No time for
questions, just action.
In or out? Okay, well, then I'm out.
I'm sorry, Jet.
Actually you're already in.
Then why would you ask me?
Because I thought
you would go, "I'm in, Bob!"
And we would've
had a really cool moment,
but you kinda ruined the whole thing.
I ruined...
Okay, okay, okay.
Listen to me right now.
Bob, I don't know what it is
that you're into
but what I do know is that
I am really, really
Do you understand that?
God, you are good!
What?
Calvin Joyner, president
of the Drama Club
for a reason, folks!
You're like
a snack-size Denzel.
Okay. Stop it,
stop it, stop it.
This is not a game.
I'm being serious right now.
I'm out!
Okay. Okay.
I can't say I'm not disappointed, Jet,
but if you're out, you're out.
Thank you! I'm out!
Well, I'm just happy
that we can communicate
openly and honestly.
I think it says a lot
about our relationship.
Wait, hold up, wait. What're you doing?
Oh, my God!
Here's the thing, though.
There's only one way
for you to get out.
What's that?
You gotta get in first.
What is it that...
What-what!
Take my gun, Jet,
we may have to kill some people.
Come on, it's not gonna bite you.
I will do no such thing.
I think you'll like it.
I will not!
You're gonna need it.
You're gonna need it!
He's in here!
Jet.
He's in there!
Bob's in there!
He's got a gun!
He's got a gun!
Down, down, get down!
Move, move, move!
All right. I'm gonna need
your improv skills.
What?
Hostage role-play,
you ready?
No!
Sweet, let's go.
No, I said no!
I said no!
AGENT: He's got a hostage!
No!
No! Stop it,
you gonna get me killed!
Don't shoot!
There we go, Jet!
Hang tight, Jet! No, I'm
not doing anything!
Stop including me in your stuff!
Get him, Agent!
Hit him with the stick!
He got a coffee pot!
He got a banana!
Oh! Oh!
Freeze!
Jet, help!
What?
Golden Jet, help.
No, man, I'm not helping you!
Oh, shit.
Give me the gun!
Stop it!
Stop resisting!
No, let me go!
Let me go! I'm trying
to give it to you!
Oh, shit!
That was an accident!
Don't move!
No, stop! Listen to me!
Let's go.
Wait, wait! Oh, come on!
What are you... Ah!
Come on, man!
This has gotta stop! Okay?
Shit!
Don't shoot!
Oh, God!
Show us your hands!
Drop your weapon!
Do it now!
Ow.
Sorry, Jet.
It's over, Bob. Give up.
You know I can't do that, Pam.
There's nowhere to run, Agent Stone.
Just like Caracas.
Uh, Caracas would've worked
if you trusted me
like Calvin trusts me.
No. No.
That is not true.
I do not trust him!
I do not trust him at all.
As a matter of fact,
this is a perfect time
for us to clear this up
especially in the middle
of this standoff.
I shouldn't be here!
So I feel like me being
in the middle of this throws me in it.
So let me exclude myself.
Hey, stay down!
Don't move!
Okay, all right.
I'll stay in. I'll stay in.
I got a plan.
Might get us both killed
but if it works, it'll be
a totally boss story.
Cool?
No! No, it's not cool!
Cool.
No, I said it's not cool.
I said it's not cool!
Time's up.
You're right, Pam.
My time is up.
In three, two,
one.
Bob, Bob, Bob!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Oh, shit!
Whoo-hoo!
Whoo!
Wow! Did you
feel that, Jet?
That was the balls right there!
CALVIN: Get it off!
You guys order an Uber?
What are you doing?
You better get your tuchus in the car.
You're gonna get shot!
Don't shoot me! Shoot him!
Shoot him! I'm out!
I'm out! I'm out!
Let me in! Let me in!
Let me in! Go, Bob!
Put the word out to all assets.
I'm doubling the price on Bob's head.
Hey, what the shit,
honey...
Get Larry on it.
Car, car, car!
All right, well,
here's the dilly-o, Jet.
About three weeks ago,
an enemy of the state
codenamed "The Black Badger"
stole the encryption keys to the
entire US spy satellite program
which he's gonna sell to a buyer
from that auction site
on your computer last night.
Bob...
If we lose control of our satellites,
we're completely vulnerable
to any terrorist attacks.
That's why I had to go back to
your office and get you, Jet.
I need your super sweet
accounting skills
to help me figure out the
last piece of this puzzle
which is the transaction
number from the winning bid.
That'll tell us where
the deal is going down.
That way, we can get The Black Badger.
I can't do it without you, Jet.
Stop the car.
You stop the car right now!
Stop the car!
Okay, okay.
That's a great idea, Jet.
We should get off the grid right now.
CALVIN: Whoa!
All right. We're clear.
Okay.
Okay. Let's just take
some deep breaths.
Okay? Deep breaths.
All you gotta do is get out of this car
and have a rational
conversation with Bob
and he'll understand.
Robert, I would like to
go home now, please.
Buddy, you and me both.
But until we clear our names,
there's no going home.
I'm sorry, can you clarify
that last sentence for me?
Yeah, well, now that you're in...
Let me stop you
right there. I'm not in.
I never said that I was in.
In fact, I expressly remember
saying that I was out!
I know, but they think you're in.
I am...
I'm freaking out!
I'm out!
What's left to tell?
Hey, no, I get it.
I'm not in! I'm just saying
they think you're in.
I'm not in! I am not in!
I get it.
I'm not in! I'm out!
One sec, Jet, just
gotta disable the GPS.
Where did you...
You wanna go under...
That's fine!
Wait a minute.
You did this on purpose, didn't you?
This whole thing was done on purpose.
This is your plan!
You tricked me!
It's fine, but I know you tricked me.
Trick you? You tricked... Hey, boy!
What?
What'd you just...
I didn't trick you,
you offered to help me.
You know what's funny?
Harris told me.
She told me everything, man.
She told me that you stole the codes.
Let me tell you something about Harris.
You can't trust her, all right?
She's already trying to frame
me for my partner's murder!
You killed your partner?
No.
I would never do that.
The Black Badger killed my partner.
Let me explain to you something, dude.
This is what happened.
After The Black Badger stole the
satellite encryption codes,
my partner Phil and I tracked
him to a penthouse in Kiev.
Hey, Phil.
Yeah.
I'll see you on the other side.
See you on the other side.
All right.
God, I love that guy.
BOB: He knew we were coming,
so he set a trap.
Hey, Bob! Bob!
No!
BOB: Phil was my partner,
my teammate
and I couldn't save him.
No!
It was awful, Cal.
It was a setup,
right from the get-go.
Damn, man.
The Black Badger was never there.
I should've been the one
on that elevator, not Phil.
God.
Okay. Bob, please...
I'm begging you, man. Can
you just let me go home?
CJ, I totally understand.
But right now, Agent
Harris and her taskforce
has that place surveilled
up the yin-yang.
She's got contract killers
looking for us.
Your place isn't safe.
Oh, my God. Maggie.
Maggie! What the hell am I
supposed to do about Maggie?
Get down, Jet!
Shit! Oh!
Look out, Bob!
Who the hell is that?
Who is that? Bob?
Oh, shit.
Larry.
Thought you retired.
I did.
But you're worth a lot of
money, Bob, dead or alive.
Well, tough luck,
because I've got back up.
Ain't that right, Jet?
Jet!
Okay.
Hey, baby. I know.
I'm sorry I'm late.
The stupid Koplin deposition ran long.
I'm leaving right now.
I'll meet you at the house.
No, no, no!
Don't go home!
Don't go home!
Why? What's going on?
Nothing! Nothing.
I'm just running late, too.
So I was gonna say let's just
meet at Dr. Dan's office.
Yeah. Okay.
Is everything all right?
Yeah! Yeah. Why?
Everything's fine.
Uh, because you kind of sound like
Ray Liotta at the end of Goodfellas.
What?
That's so funny, babe.
That's such a good reference.
That's classic Mags right there.
So, okay. So you're not
gonna go home, right?
Okay, fine.
I won't go home.
I'll meet you at Dr. Dan's.
See you soon.
Okay. All right, bye.
All right, bye.
Get in.
I'm gonna
address the elephant
in the room.
Okay, first of all, you...
You guys, I want to say sorry to.
Because what you're probably
thinking is not what happened.
Accidents!
I know you're like,
"How can you accidentally
pistol-whip somebody
"and shoot somebody?"
Well, it can happen.
Okay? Today is proof
that it can happen. So...
I'm glad I got to
get that off my chest.
Relax, Mr. Joyner.
I believe you.
Okay, thank you.
Trust me, I know a scared-shitless
civilian when I see one.
You don't have to convince me.
You got him over here.
That is me.
Right now, I'm not comfortable.
Okay, I am scared, okay?
I don't have no shit in my system.
If I sat down on a toilet,
nothing's coming out.
Farts or just air.
It'd sound like lasers.
Thank you for that description.
Mr. Joyner,
let me explain something.
Bob's last forced psych eval
show a person rapidly
losing his grip on reality.
Bob became obsessed with a ghost,
a figment of his imagination,
he started calling,
"The Black Badger."
This obsession led to an instability,
first reported by his partner,
Phil, three weeks ago.
Just before Phil
was killed in the field.
Do you know how Phil died?
Yeah, uh, Bob told me that
The Black Badger killed him.
What?
What?
Mr. Joyner, Bob Stone
is The Black Badger.
Phil was Bob's partner of six years.
His best friend.
See you on the other side.
See you on the other side.
Hey, Bob!
AGENT HARRIS: After he stole
the satellite encryption codes
Bob betrayed Phil.
No!
He killed him to cover his tracks.
And, after that, Bob went rogue.
This is all that's left of Phil.
Um, this is PornHub.
Oh, shit, shit,
shit. Sorry.
There you go.
CALVIN: Oh! Oh, God!
Oh, I didn't see that coming.
Oh, man!
It's a hell of a way to go.
Okay, wait a minute.
Why wouldn't Bob just go sell the
satellite encryption codes himself?
Because in a black market,
blind-bidding situation
the buyer and the seller,
they don't know each other.
They need the auction site
to tell them exactly where to meet up
and when to make the exchange.
The transaction number from the
auction site gives them that,
which means Bob still needs you.
Which is why we find ourselves
in a little catch-and-release
scenario.
You are the only one Bob trusts.
That's why we're
putting you in the field.
The next time you're with Bob,
press this button.
We're going to have him cold.
Now, go take care of your marriage.
Oh, one more thing.
Don't tell your wife shit.
All right.
MAGGIE: I just don't know
what's wrong.
I mean, the man that I married,
the person I knew in high school,
he was filled with
drive and desire. I mean...
We used to sneak off every lunch hour
and make out under the gym bleachers.
Like, that guy, back then,
he wanted things, you know?
DR. DAN: Hmm.
Hey, I'm sorry I'm late. I
couldn't find the parking.
Hi, no, no, it's okay.
We got started without you.
Babe, Calvin,
this is Dr. Dan.
Hello, Calvin.
Oh, shit! Oh, jeez. What's the matter?
Holy shit! Get behind me!
Honey... Calvin, what?
It's okay, Maggie.
It's okay. Just relax.
This is a very common reaction
in the therapeutic process.
It is?
What?
It is.
It absolutely is.
Calvin, this is a very safe place.
Please, sit down.
This is not a safe place! No, no, no.
Honey, it's a...
No, this is most definitely
not a safe place!
Me and my wife
are leaving. Let's go.
No, no, no! You are
going to sit down...
And we are going to go through
this therapeutic process...
Yes...together, as a couple.
Um... Fine, fine, fine.
Sit down. Thank you.
Fine.
Okay, guys.
Why don't we start off
with a little bit of word association?
Okay.
This is exciting.
I've heard this can really
open a couple up.
Uh, Maggie, I'm going to
offer you a word,
and you respond however you're moved to
from here.
Okay.
Black.
White.
Water.
Ocean.
Sunshine.
Happy.
I'm very impressed, Maggie.
Really?
You're very in tune.
I'm very in tune.
Calvin, you're next.
I do not want to do this.
Relax, Calvin.
There are no wrong answers.
Up.
Down.
Mmm.
"Mmm." What is that?
What're you writing in your book?
It's fine. Don't freak out.
Nobody's freaking out.
I just don't understand
the rules to the game.
Freaking out.
Let's switch gears for a second, okay?
Why don't we try a simple
role-playing exercise?
Calvin, you be Calvin
and I will become Maggie.
Mmm.
I'm confused.
It's called "soul gazing."
Stare into my soul
and I'll stare into yours.
Maggie, this...
Hey. Shh.
There's no talking,
and don't look away.
Stare into my soul.
You are not my...
Shh. There's no talking.
Babe, I'm not staring...
Me and you.
Stay with me. I'm your wife.
You are not my wife.
How could you hit your wife?
How can I...
How can I what?
You hit your wife!
No...
He hit me!
Okay.
He hit you!
Okay.
You hit us!
I'm swaddling you.
I know what you're doing.
I'm swaddling you.
I know what you're...
Come here.
Oh, my God!
You...
You know what?
We're leaving! Let's go!
This is not real.
It's real to me.
You know what, Calvin?
If you can't commit
to working on our marriage,
then you need to let me know.
Maggie, you...
What!
Oh, my God!
You're...
Something's not right.
Come on, Jet, listen.
Come on, come on, Jet!
Now, I know things got a
little rough there at the end.
But the truth is, with all the heat
that you have coming down on you,
Maggie is definitely safer without you.
And, trust me, when this
whole thing is said and done
and you basically save
the entire free world,
she's going to forgive you.
It'll all work itself out.
It'll all work itself out?
Okay, Bob, you know, I'm sick
of playing games with you.
Where's the real Dr. Dan?
What-what?
Oh, my... Dr. Dan, I had
nothing to do with this.
He's fine. I'll get you
some water in a little bit.
Thanks, doc.
You know...
That's it. That is it.
That is it.
All right, Jet.
I see that Harris has
given you a button to push.
Relax, I would've taken the same
deal, too, if I was in your shoes.
Otherwise, she wouldn't let
you out of her sight, right?
It makes perfect sense.
But you're not going to
press the button, right?
You got the top-secret
satellite codes?
Yes or no?
This ain't the time to bullshit me.
Okay, my ass is sweating.
I'm nervous.
Don't bullshit me!
Of course not, dude.
Hey, hey, come on!
Of course, I don't have the codes.
Why would I go through
all this trouble, then?
I need your skill set, Jet,
to help me get the bank transaction
numbers to the winning bid.
We already know it's going down tonight
from the countdown on your computer.
Now, all we need is
the "where."
And the bank transaction numbers
will give us the "where."
That's why I need you.
Your job gives you access to
exactly that kind of information.
Then we can get The Badger,
we can get the buyer
in one fell swoop.
And it'll all be over tonight.
Please, I swear.
You gotta believe me.
Can't you just get us
the transaction number?
Not when the money originates
from an offshore account.
When that happens, then only a certified
international banking official
can access it.
But, it shouldn't be a problem.
We just give this guy the offshore
account numbers that you gave me,
then he can give us
the transaction number
without knowing that he's
committing treason when he does it.
Sound familiar?
Ouch! Low blow, CJ.
Hey, besides, it's only
treason if we're wrong.
Who's this mystery man?
It's Trevor.
Trevor.
TREVOR: This week
just keeps getting better.
You know, I mean...
Robbie Wheirdicht and Calvin "The
Golden Jet" Joyner in my office.
Who would've thunk it?
Not me.
This is great, huh?
Talk about caterpillar
to the butterfly...
What is this? P-90-X?
More like
"P-1,000,000-X," huh?
Congratulations.
CALVIN:
Hey, I, um...
I really appreciate the help, Trevor.
My client's all on me to get
this stuff handled right away.
So, you know, if we could...
Say no more. It's my pleasure.
I've been there.
These international accounts
can be very, very tricky
if you don't have the right clearances.
You can get a bunch of
digital red tape.
I'm happy to help, you know?
Robbie.
You're such a blast
from the past, buddy.
How long has it been since I saw you?
Was it high school?
What's that?
Um... How we doing
with those account access codes?
Are they coming?
TREVOR: It's coming.
Everything's good?
It's coming.
I'm going as fast as I can. I know you
guys are in a rush. I'm so sorry.
Anything for a couple of
fellow Centaurs.
Speaking of which, you guys are going
to the reunion tonight, right?
No, I don't think so.
You're both going.
Here it is. Here's your
transaction number.
You're both going because
you want to know what?
They're going to vote on
homecoming king and queen again.
Maybe you and Maggie
can make it two for two.
Now, before you go,
stay seated one second.
Give me two minutes, sit down.
Men,
a few years ago...
I found the Lord Almighty.
And, ever since then,
my life has been
completely different. Okay?
He's got a plan for each
and every one of us
and, in his infinite wisdom,
he makes no mistakes. Hmm?
You're right about that.
I think the Lord put you here because
he wants me to get
something off my chest.
He wants me to clear my conscience
and he wants me to ask for forgiveness.
Robert.
What I did to you at that
rally in senior year
was a cowardly act.
It's something that I've
regretted every single day.
Yeah. I mean, bullying
is a national crisis.
It can leave people
with a lifetime of pain.
So...
I just want to say how truly sorry I am
for what happened, you know.
Or for what I did.
It didn't just happen.
I did it.
I did it, and I wish to God
that I had not done it.
So, I'm hoping that you
can find it in your heart
to forgive me.
I wasn't expecting this at all.
Don't I know it.
I know it.
I'm just so happy.
Uh, I don't know what to say.
How about you say...
"The Oscar goes
to Trevor Olson."
What do you mean?
Weird Dick!
You stupid ass!
Good God, you're dumb!
Dumber than ever, I guess!
And you, too, Calvin!
Look at that stupid look
on those two faces.
"The Lord taught me to care."
Unbelievable.
I'm a Scientologist.
Okay, that's "A."
And thetan-free since 2003.
Clear as shit.
And I'm sorry for what I did?
Let me tell you what I'm sorry about.
I'm sorry I didn't toss your naked
ass out there three more times.
It was the best senior prank ever.
I still get emails about it.
Know what?
You're going to regret you ever opened
your mouth. You hear me, Trevor?
Oh, yeah?
How come, Calvin?
Oh, because he's about to
whoop your ass, that's why.
Who is?
Bob, get up and whoop his ass.
Oh, here she comes!
Let me tell you something...
Weird Dick can't chug a bunch
of steroids and elk urine
and miraculously be able
to kick my ass all of a sudden, okay?
It ain't gonna happen.
'Cause here's why.
Once a fat kid, always a fat kid.
Huh? Prove me wrong.
Bob, come on.
Do what you did in the bar.
Come on, hit me!
And I'll sue your ass, and
take your fanny pack away.
What's the matter with you?
I just want to go.
She wants to go.
Go ahead. There you go.
No, it's a push.
Boy, 50-50 shot.
You missed that.
At least you found the handle.
Boy, he's still a scared little bitch.
You know, you're still an asshole.
Yeah, well, you're still
shorter than my cat.
Here's your transaction number.
Hit it, Ant-Man.
Thank you, Trevor.
Yup.
Glad to see you haven't changed a bit.
Bye-bye now.
Was it push or pull?
Clean push.
Which one is it? You want
me to do it for you?
Which one is it?
Hey, hey, hey!
Goddamn it, Joyner!
Jenny!
Jenny, get the Windex!
And security for this one.
Get your asshole
off my door! That's it!
Bob! Bob!
Bob! Bob! Bob!
Mr. Joyner. Guess who
we're about to arrest
for conspiracy to commit treason.
That's right.
Your lovely wife.
So, here's what you're going to do.
You're going to tell us exactly
where you and Bob are.
And then you're going to go outside
and you're going to keep Bob on-site
until we arrive.
And if he leaves, you lose.
Is that clear?
Oh, hey.
I don't know what happened in there,
and I just froze up.
I locked up. I'm sorry.
Look, Bob, I, uh...
No, I gotta tell you
something, CJ, listen.
You're the only one
who's ever been nice to me,
the only one who's never laughed at me.
And you're the only one in
this whole world that I trust.
And I know you have a lot of friends...
but I don't.
You're my only friend, Calvin.
And I will never let you
down again, I promise.
I'm sorry, man.
Sorry for what?
I told Harris where we are.
They were going to hurt Maggie.
I had to.
I didn't have a choice.
I'm sorry.
Freeze, Bob!
Hands on your head!
Do it now!
I know you know how this goes,
so I'll spare you the dramatics.
I'll ask you just once.
Where are the satellite
encryption codes?
Aw. What's the matter, Bob?
Are you upset that
your friend turned you in?
I don't have any friends.
Okay, I don't want to watch this, guys.
Don't worry, it'll be over quick.
She always gets them to break.
AGENT HARRIS:
Okay.
You have it your way.
We're going to
do this old-school.
Get the extraction tools.
The extraction tools?
If you don't have the
stomach for it, you can go.
Come on.
Stop recording.
Why am I coming here?
I was told I'd be able to leave.
You can leave,
when Agent Harris says you can leave,
which might be never.
I gotta watch this.
I'm sorry, Bob.
I'm sorry, man.
Oh, Jesus!
What the hell?
Hey! Hey!
Don't move!
You get your hands off!
Get them off the keyboard!
What are you doing, Calvin?
Give me your keycard!
Give me your keycard!
Give it to me.
Okay...
Go sit down.
Okay. Yeah.
Sorry. I'm sorry.
Sit down! Sit down!
Okay, okay, okay.
You know, Bob?
This is actually my
favorite part of the job.
Thank you for being so uncooperative.
What do you think
your little buddy, Joyner,
would say if he could
see you like this?
Two words.
I'm in.
What-what?
You're making
a big mistake, Mr. Joyner.
That's only if I'm wrong.
Come on, Bob. Let's go!
What're you doing?
Come on, man!
Okay, listen to me.
Bob, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I double-crossed you.
You hear me?
I should've believed you,
I should've trusted you, and I didn't.
I'm sorry for that.
Listen to me. Bob, we don't
have time for this, man!
I need you to tap into
that super-spy stuff
and I need you to get us the
hell out of here right now.
Do you hear me?
Now, come on, man.
We boys?
We're boys.
Oh!
Sorry, Jet.
Oh, God!
Oh, God!
See? Good as new.
Wow. Sorry, man.
AGENT: Go, go!
Get me out!
He got the jump on us.
Give me the key.
CALVIN: Look out, Bob!
Here, Jet! Get him!
Watch out!
Did you see that, Bob?
I did the thing!
I did the thing, Bob!
Yeah!
Yeah! Yeah!
Come on! Follow me!
Let's do it!
No! What am I doing?
Here! You go! You bigger.
Okay, okay.
I'm behind you.
AGENT: Roger that, base.
Confirming there's been
a security breach.
Oh, my God.
There's two of them.
Yeah, I'll distract them
and you open the door, okay?
What? No!
Let's roll.
No, no.
Go, go!
Close in!
Moving out!
Freeze, Bob! BOB: Sorry
about this, guys.
BOB: Nope, come here.
Come on.
Wrong keycard, pal.
Turn around.
You needed this one.
On the ground, now.
Can I say something first?
What?
This is going to hurt.
Hey, get the keycard!
Let's roll.
All right, all right.
Which car are we taking?
Not that one.
Oh. Oh, my God.
Oh, God. Oh, sh...
Oh.
Here we go, Jet.
Bob, they are shooting at us!
It's okay, it's bulletproof.
Drive, drive!
Here you go, Jet.
What's this?
Bug-out bag,
courtesy of the CIA.
Go ahead and grab that
encrypted phone in there.
For what?
You still have
the bank transaction code?
How are transaction numbers gonna help
us find out where the bad guys are?
Well, it's not bank transaction
numbers or codes, it's actually...
Longitude and latitude.
Look at
the spy brain on the Jet!
What-what!
You're like a chocolate
Google.
Bob, don't do that.
Stop it.
Stop it.
You're getting good at this, man.
Yeah, you're absolutely right.
It's longitude and latitude.
All you gotta do is plug those
digits into the GPS, and boom!
We're gonna catch the buyer and
The Badger, just like that.
Boston.
We're gonna need a plane.
You ever steal a plane before?
I stole some Starbursts one time.
Mmm-hmm.
So I don't know if that
compares or anything,
but I wasn't successful with that.
On the way out, I dropped 'em.
Dropped the whole bag.
The guy caught me.
"What's that?"
I just said, "A Starburst."
Told him myself.
It was a mess.
Check it out.
The universe provides.
CALVIN: Oh.
Golden Jet.
Golden Jet.
Golden Jet.
It's just one guard in there.
All right.
You get in there
and distract that guard,
I'm gonna get us a plane.
What?
I don't know what the hell you expect...
Bob!
Bob!
Bob!
Damn it!
Hey, uh, I need a plane.
Sir, you cannot be in here.
This is a private airfield.
I understand that but I have an
organ in this cooler right now
that needs to get transported ASAP.
Really?
Because my sister-in-law had
a heart transplant last year
and they did not bring it
in a Playmate lunch cooler.
Well, I hate to break it to you,
but this is not a, uh...
This is not a heart.
Oh, it's not a heart?
No, it's not.
Hmm. What is it then?
It's a dick.
Okay.
I am made of questions right now.
Well, you don't have to ask.
Last night, lady got
into it with a man.
She ended up cutting his pecker off.
She left with it, got in a car, drove,
got on 95, threw it out the window.
The second largest penis
hunt in the state history.
The man was Korean,
so you better believe
it took a long time to find.
JARED: You're stereotyping
Korean dicks.
That's racist.
I've seen Korean dicks bigger than you.
Okay, sir, we don't need
to demean each other here.
I don't believe a word you're saying.
Let me see it.
I have no problem showing you this.
So if you wanna see it
then get ready to see.
Here I go.
Go for it.
Oh, shit! Oh, shit.
I'm just kidding.
This is my friend.
Oh!
It's my buddy.
His name's Snake Gyllenhaal.
He guards my lunch.
Okay, that's enough.
It's gotta be Harris, right?
What do you mean?
I mean, she's gotta be
The Black Badger.
It's the only thing that makes sense.
I mean, she's had access
to the encryption codes
and she's so hot and bothered about
pinning this whole thing on you.
It's gotta be her!
I don't know, Jet.
I'm pretty sure she thinks
I'm The Black Badger.
She worked me over pretty good
in that interrogation room.
Hold on, wait, wait...
What's going on?
What's that? Whoa. Whoa.
What's going on right now, Bob?
No biggie.
We're completely outta gas.
Oh, my... Oh!
We're going down, Jet!
There's nothing I can do!
Oh, shit!
Really quickly...
What's the one thing you wish
you'd done in your life?
The one thing I wish I hadn't done
is not get in a plane with a guy
who didn't check the goddamned fuel!
Why wouldn't you check the fuel?
No, something that's real.
What's the one thing you
regret not doing for you?
Oh, my God!
I think we're gonna die!
Not having a kid, man!
Not being a father!
I regret not being a father!
Maggie, I should've gave you a kid!
I should've gave you my seed, Maggie!
I should've!
I'm so selfish!
I'm sorry, Maggie!
That wasn't so hard, right? What?
Hey, just for the record,
I think you'd make a great dad.
Did you just fake this whole thing?
Yeah, kinda.
Oh, you gotta be shitting me glory!
No, not at all.
I just thought that maybe
facing your own death situation
might help motivate you
to clarify some of your goals in life.
And, hey, between me and you,
I know you've been
struggling a little bit.
You know what I'm struggling
with right now, Bob?
Not whooping your ass.
Okay, Jet.
Hey, you're really cute when you cry.
Stop it! Enough!
I don't get it.
I mean, if these
coordinates are correct,
we should be standing
right on top of it.
Well, the deal doesn't go down
for another 30 minutes, Jet,
so we're kinda early.
No!
Why would you do it
out in the open like this?
Why would you take that risk?
Just doesn't make any sense, man.
Shit! Come on.
Wait.
Oh, wait. It's not happening up here.
No, it's not. It's...
Oh, it's happening
beneath us. Look.
It's an underground parking garage.
Yeah, that's a good eye, Jet.
Why don't you stay up here?
Keep overwatch.
I'll go down there
and check things out.
Wait, what?
No, I'm going with you.
Well, you can't go with me.
The smarter play is if we split up.
Smarter play for who?
Do you know what happens
when people split up, Bob?
Somebody dies!
I'd be the one to die.
You know why?
Because I don't have a bulletproof vest
and I don't have a gun!
Which means that you
are my bulletproof vest!
My little black ass is gonna stay
behind you, you're not leaving me!
That's exactly why
you should stay up here.
Look, if you went down in that
garage and you got shot to death
you know how hurt I would be?
I'd be super bummed out!
I don't want that.
It's safer for you up here.
If something happened up here,
what am I supposed to do, Bob?
How do I get your attention?
Make a bird call?
Does that sound like
a bird to you? Huh?
That's my biggest weakness!
I can't make bird noises.
I never could.
So if that's what I gotta
depend on to live,
it means I'm gonna die!
I'mma die up here, by myself
sounding like
a dead-ass pigeon.
I have no idea what a pigeon...
Jet, Jet, Jet, Jet, Jet!
You don't have to make bird noises.
You don't have to sound like a pigeon.
All you gotta do is call
me on the encrypted phone
that's in your hand.
Okay?
Okay, yeah.
I'll be right back Okay.
All right?
Oh, Jet.
I'll see you on the other side.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You're early.
So are you.
Come on.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God.
I knew it.
I knew it. I knew she
was The Black Badger!
Oh, my God!
Pick up the phone.
Pick up the phone.
BOB: Yello?
Bob, Harris is The Black Badger!
Hello?
Harris is The Black Badger!
I can't hear you.
Harris is The Black Badger!
Just kidding! I'm not here.
Leave a message at the beep.
What?
Oh. Harris is
The Black Badger!
Harris is The Black Badger!
I knew it. I knew it.
Harris is The Black Badger!
Bob! Harris is The...
Who is he?
That's my partner.
I don't like splitting my fees.
The package. Please.
Thought you'd never ask.
Wait! You're making a mistake.
Hello, Bob.
But you're dead.
Not as much as people think.
Look, he's not The Black Badger...
I am.
And those aren't the encryption codes,
these are.
He's lying to you.
This man is a CIA agent,
and he's trying
to sell you bogus plans.
Damn.
Ow, ow.
He shot me.
These are the real codes
and I am the real Black Badger.
Bob is The Black Badger.
Bob is The Black Badger.
I am The Black Badger.
Phil?
No, I'm The Black Badger.
I'm starting to think
I might be The Black Badger.
Here's the thing.
I have no idea who is
the real Black Badger.
And I don't care.
'Cause I'm The Honey Badger.
And The Honey Badger
doesn't give a shit.
The Honey Badger's nasty.
He's so nasty, he'll take them both.
Hand them over.
Phil, when this thing is over,
I'm going to rip your throat out
like Patrick Swayze in Road House.
PHIL: Oh, my God.
You and Road House.
Get over that movie.
It sucked then, it sucks now.
The only movie that sucks
more is Sixteen Candles.
How dare you!
Drop your weapons!
Oh! Oh, shit!
The codes.
Don't do it.
Stupid.
Okay.
One,
two,
three! Shit!
Uh-oh! Oh!
No!
He's got the codes!
Whoo!
I mean, this is crazy, right?
You stay the hell away from me, Bob!
You shot me in the neck!
Jet!
Okay.
Golden Jet for the win!
No. Shit!
Drop your weapon, Bob.
Oh, shit!
Get behind me,
Mr. Joyner.
Oh, you don't wanna do that, Jet.
It's obvious he's the bad guy.
I'm the good guy.
You wanna get behind me.
Agent Harris had me go dark
to get Bob to reveal himself
as The Black Badger.
You don't seriously
believe this guy, do you?
You wanna get behind me, Jet.
You betrayed your nation, Bob.
You betrayed your partner, Phil.
Okay, no, wait!
Everybody just stop!
Cut the shit!
I'mma cut the line right now!
I cut the shit!
Hear me? Now I don't
care who betrayed who.
Okay? I just don't
wanna get hurt!
So there ain't
gonna be no... Shit!
Come on.
Shi...
Shit.
Smart move,
Mr. Joyner.
You've done your country
a great service.
Now, hand me the firearm
and we'll turn over the
satellite codes together.
Stay right there, man.
Don't you take another step.
Just because I shot him
does not mean I trust you.
We don't have time for this.
Stop! I said, "Stop."
Aw, whoopsie.
Nice throw, bitch.
You wanna know why your pal Bob
could never have been The Black Badger?
It's because he's too weak.
And if I had to hear
another goddamned story
about Calvin "The Golden Jet" Joyner
and how awesome you were in high school
and how you were this
big idiot's best friend...
I was just gonna lose it.
Looking at you right now,
you don't seem so cool.
You just seem like a regular guy.
An everyday Joe.
You know, faking my own
death was the easy part.
But dealing with Bob, day after day,
was the hard part.
Hey, Phil.
What, Bob?
I'll see you on the other side.
No, I hope
we don't. All right?
Just no. Bye, bye, bye.
Just go.
I made up the Black Badger,
rigged up a blood bag
and that big dummy bought it.
Bob!
No, no!
Hang on, buddy.
No, there's some sort of bomb in here.
You're pushing it closed, I think.
No, no, no. Sorry.
No, don't give up!
Bye, Bob.
PHIL: I'm getting away with
a half a billion dollars.
And Boy Scout Bob is gonna
spend his life in prison.
Ain't America great?
So now you're gonna be
the second partner of Bob's to die.
Just relax.
On your knees, Golden Jet.
What the hell was that?
Golden Jet flip.
Yeah? Well, you
really suck at it.
I know.
Then why'd you do it?
Distraction.
Oh, you just pulled his throat out!
I'll see you on the other side.
Oh, Jet, come here. Give
me your hand, old buddy.
Oh, shit! Get that
away from me!
Sorry, Jet.
Come here, Jet. That was a trachea.
Great distraction, man!
Sorry I had to shoot you, Jet.
It was the only way
I could save your life.
But when you shot me
to get Phil to confess
that he was The Black Badger
that was some
next-level-type shit!
Yeah, no. I'm glad you
see it the way I saw it.
That was my plan
the whole time. So...
You are a natural
for this line of work.
I mean, you're smart,
you got the skill set,
you're a people person
and you already got
a dope-ass code name,
"The Golden Jet!" What?
But in the meantime, we gotta
get those encryption codes
over to Harris right away
or we're gonna be late.
What are you talking about?
Late for what?
The reunion, dude. What-what!
This shit's on!
Bob.
Damn it.
Bob!
One more thing.
Thanks for securing
the satellite codes.
You really saved my ass.
Your country thanks you.
Just doing my job.
I'm really sorry about your hand.
I hope you know that wasn't personal.
Oh, no hard feelings
at all, Pam.
Besides, everybody makes mistakes.
Calvin, here, thought
you were The Black Badger.
I don't...
No, I don't think...
When we were in the plane,
you said, "Hey, Harris
is the Black..."
I think you should...
Maybe I...
Mr. Joyner, it was a
pleasure working with you.
If you ever want a career change,
you give me a call.
If I were to give you a call,
how would I get in touch with you?
Just pick up any phone in your house.
They're all bugged.
You're crazy.
Hey, you're crazy!
That's a good one.
Calvin!
I got your text and came right over.
Where the hell have you been?
Why did you get out of a helicopter?
Hey, uh, Maggie.
Uh, hi!
Babe, why
is Dr. Dan with you?
Well... Uh...
That's not Dr. Dan.
Allow me to properly introduce myself.
My name is Bob Stone,
the artist formerly known
as Robbie Wheirdicht.
I work for the CIA.
I roped your husband into helping
me track down a traitor,
who was gonna sell military
state secrets to a terrorist.
We did all that, we stopped them,
we saved the free world,
and here we are.
What the hell is going on?
Okay, listen, listen.
I've been a fool.
All right?
I thought that my life was a failure.
I thought that it wasn't special.
But it is special.
It's special because I have you in it.
You are my world. You are
what makes me special!
You're everything to me, Mags.
I love you.
I love you.
BOB: Okay.
Here come the waterworks.
I promised myself I wouldn't do this.
Come on, come on. Okay.
That's Robbie Wheirdicht? Yeah.
Hi, Brian.
Hi, Gail.
Guys, this isn't a good idea.
You know what?
I'll just meet you later.
I shouldn't have come.
Wait, wait, wait.
Bob, calm down, okay?
Listen to me.
Tonight is not gonna be how high
school was for you 20 years ago.
I promise.
HOSTESS: Attention, por favor.
And now,
for the moment you've all
been waiting for,
tonight's vote for the reunion
homecoming king and queen!
We'll announce the queen in one moment.
But first, without further ado...
The new homecoming king
for the Central High School
Centaurs, Class of 1996 is...
I really gotta pee, Jet.
Bob Stone!
Do we have a Bob Stone?
Here he is, Bob Stone, huh!
Yeah!
Go on, get your
rock-hard ass up there.
For reals?
For reals, for reals.
Go ahead, man.
Whoo!
You did it, big guy!
How did Bob Stone win homecoming king?
I hacked into the votes
on the flight in.
Calvin Joyner, forensic accountant,
at your service.
I had no idea you could do that.
There's a lot of things that you
don't know about me, Maggie.
No, scratch that I said that.
It was supposed to
come out cool. It didn't.
It was something I thought
of, it was like a...
Forget it.
TREVOR: Well, well,
let's hear it for him!
Fat Robbie made good.
King Robbie Weird Dick,
our naked mascot.
Still a scared
little bitch.
I don't like bullies.
And the name is Bob Stone, bitch!
Whoo-whoo!
Come on, baby.
Step over.
Hi, everybody!
Most of you knew me back
in high school as, um...
Robbie Wheirdicht.
MAN 1: That's
Robbie Wheirdicht?
MAN 2: No way!
I wore prescription pants every day.
I stood in front of you all
naked
and embarrassed.
Some of you might remember that day.
A lot of you probably even laughed.
But that's okay.
Tonight's gonna be different because
my best friend is here with me.
And he taught me what it means
to be the hero of your own story.
Would you hold this for me, please?
Being the hero of your own story
isn't about stopping bad guys
or climbing mountains.
It's about overcoming
bullies in your life,
whatever or whomever they may be.
It's about putting it all out there
for everyone
to see.
And it's realizing that, in life,
the most important thing
that you can be...
is yourself.
So, Central High,
Class of 1996,
this is me,
Robbie Wheirdicht.
Oh, my God! Bob just went commando!
Yes! Yes!
CALVIN: Way to go, Bob!
Be you!
Robbie!
Robbie! Robbie!
ALL: Robbie! Robbie! Robbie!
Hey, man!
Dude, this is amazing!
I'm so happy for you!
Thank you, Jet!
I feel so free!
Come here.
No, no, no. Your junk is out. Huh?
Oh. Sorry, Jet.
Excuse me.
Hi, Robbie.
You probably don't remember me.
Darla.
Is that Darla McGuckian? Yeah.
Wow! She looks great!
Didn't she used to have a lazy eye?
Two of them.
Wow.
I can't believe you remember me.
Remember you?
How could I forget you?
You still have the same sweet smile,
the same sweet face.
But your hair's changed.
You used to wear it curlier.
I like it though.
You haven't changed at all.
Oh, I don't know.
You're still as beautiful as ever.
Oh.
Yeah, Bob!
Go, Bob!
No, no, no.
Oh, I got spinny.
Super spinny.
Yeah, that's nice.
That's my jam!
Go show them what you got.
All right, Darla.
Good going, Bob!
Come on, Bob!
All right, babe.
Good luck!
Love you.
I love you.
I love you, too, little Golden Jet!
Mmm...
Okay. Uh...
How long do you think he's been there?
MAGGIE: Hmm, probably
since last night.
All right, babe, I'll see you later.
Have fun with your friend!
Who, me?
Yes, you.
Wow, Jet!
You look amazing!
Do you think?
Oh, what? Yes!
I just didn't know the kind of look to
go for on my first day at the agency.
