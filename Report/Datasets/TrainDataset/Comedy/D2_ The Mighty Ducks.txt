- Bring it in, Gordon.
- Okay, Dad.
All right! Way to shoot, there.
You look good, son.
Thanks.
Listen, i want you
to remember this pond.
No matter how far you go,
don't forget your home.
Here in the third period, where the
Minnehaha Waves led by Gordon Bombay...
are in the lead four to one.
What a story this is.!
He went from a legal career to coach
the Minneapolis Mighty Ducks...
to a State Pee Wee
Championship last year.
And this year, at age 29...
he's one short step away
from the N.H.L.
There's the puck at center ice.
It's intercepted by Gordon Bombay.
Bombay across the blue line. He's in
all alone. Great chance for Bombay.
Dekes once, twice, in front.
He shoots. He scores.!
Yeah!
Gordon Bombay, unassisted,
puts his team up five to one.
Boy, he can still fly.
Ifhe keeps this up, I'd expect to see
him in the National Hockey League...
real soon.
Here's Bombay in his own zone. Comes up the
right wing side, steps away from one check there.
Still has the puck at center ice.
Gets pinned along the boards.
Fights to get free.
Aah! Aah!
Oh, what a hit.!
Bombay goes down hard.
~Like the river flows ~
~Like the snow melts ~
~ You're gonna find your situation ~
~ Changing for the better ~
~Like the melting snow ~
~Just let your troubles go ~
~ 'Cause you and I ~
~ will get through this together ~
- ~Some days seem to drag on forever ~
- it's great to be home.
~ You need all your strength ~
- ~Just to keep your head together ~
- Hello,Jan!
Welcome back, Gordon.
Get in! Get in!
Thanks for comin' down to get me.
Great to see ya.
Hans couldn't make it?
Ah, don't get me
started on that strudel-head.
He went back
to the old country for the summer.
Left me to run
the shop all by myself.
Wanted to visit our mama.
She loves him more, you know.
~ This too will pass ~
~ This too will pass ~~
- Sorry, did i wake you?
- Hey, Charlie.
- Hey, Coach. it's good to see you.
- Good to see you.
We really missed you.
For breakfast, my specialty:
Jan's hasen-
Hasenpfeffer and eggs.
- Yeah.
I thought I smelled
something burning.
i see you've met
my new apprentice.
Jan told me you did
this job when you were my age.
- That's right. i hope he pays you more than he paid me.
- You got paid?
Eat, everybody, before
the hasenpfeffer gets cold.
That was a good day.
Look at Charlie. God, he's grown.
Oh. They do that.
Since his mother remarried, he
started spending a lot of time here.
i just had to hire him.
- i should've kept in touch more.
- But you are here now.
So what's your plan?
Have you talked
to Ducksworth?
No, no. i'm not a lawyer,
Jan, i'm a player.
But your injury,
it requires rest and time.
Yeah, time is something
i don't have a whole lot of.
i was this close to the N.H.L.,Jan.
i was back in the game.
And, man, i was alive.
Have you thought about coaching?
After all, you were
the Minnesota Miracle Man.
Well, coaching the Ducks was one
of the best things in my life...
but i can't make a living
coaching Pee Wee hockey.
Where there's a way,
there must be a will.
My hockey suppliers tell me
Team U.S.A. is still without a coach...
for the
Junior Goodwill Games.
Sounds great. Give 'em
a call for me,Jan.
- Maybe i can sharpen their skates.
- Don't knock skate sharpening.
i know.
it's a great skill,Jan.
But i don't want to spend the rest of my life
sharpening skates in this rinky-dink town.
i want something better.
Something bigger.
Whoa!
- You don't have to do them right now.
- Oh, thanks.
You have a customer.
Go and help him.
Then come back and do them.
- Can i help you?
- Oh!
Oops, sorry.
Got away from me. Hi.
Oh, wow, yeah.
You look great. Yeah.
- Yeah, much better than your pictures.
- Thanks.
i'm, uh, Don Tibbles...
Senior V.P.,
Hendrix Hockey Apparel.
How's the knee? i have a doctor in Los
Angeles i want to take a look at it.
- He's doing great things with baboon ligaments.
- Hendrix Hockey, huh?
What exactly is it that
you want, Mr. Tibbles?
i want you, Gordon.
i want the next coach ofTeam
U.S.A. to become a household name.
i want you to become
synonymous with winning...
and winning to become
synonymous with Hendrix.
Er, wait a minute.
Y- You're joking, right? i mean...
- this is a joke.
- it's no joke. This is the real thing, Gordon.
You want me to coach
Team U.S.A.?
Your friend Jan's been
pitching you for months.
Gordon, what you did with the
Ducks, there was magic, and we-
and by we, i mean
Hendrix Hockey...
theJunior Goodwill Games and your country
- need that magic.
What do ya say, coach?
Come on.
Let's round up those Ducks.
- Got a lot of work to do.
- Gordon.
Use this.
- Thanks,Jan.
- Go get 'em, Gordon.
Hey, Charlie.!

Hey, guys! i'm Don Tibbles,
Hendrix Hockey Apparel.
We're your official sponsors.
Anybody want a card?
Yeah, yeah! Absolutely!
i'll take one!
Hey.
Nice wheels. i used to
ride around in one of these.
Well, i got something
to show you.
This is your endorsement
contract with Hendrix.
i been tryin' to figure this out.
What does Hendrix want with me?
- i-i'm just a coach.
- Pat Riley, Bear Bryant...
Mike Ditka,
are theyjust coaches?
Gordon, today coaches have
images. Images mean dollars.
i sell you, you sell the sport.
We both get rich. How's that sound?
- Don't get me wrong. i don't have anything against making money.
- No, Gordon.
A lot of money.
You're gonna pay me that much
to endorse sportswear?
Gordon, life can be great
when you know the right people.
What do you say?
- Got a pen?
- Oh,yeah.
Former Pee Wee coach and minor
league player Gordon Bombay...
makes the move to the national stage as
he steps behind the bench for Team U.S.A.
Coach Bombay's Ducks will bejoined
by some of the top young players...
from around the United States.
Tell me about my new kids.
- That's Luis Mendoza.
He's from our Miami club.
A real speedster. Incredible skater.
I clocked him at 1.9 seconds,
blue line to blue line.
- Good-lookin' skater. - Very
good-lookin'. What do you think, Guy?
- Shut up, Averman.
- Oof!.
He has one minor problem.
Aah!
- Has a little trouble stopping.
- i'd say so.
- Are you okay?
- Need some help?
Yeah. i'm all right.
i almost had it that time.
Yee-haw! How is everyone!
Y'all ready to play some puck?
- Hey, look.
it's Hopalong Gretzky.
That's Dwayne Robertson
from Austin.
He's the best puck handler
I've ever seen.
- You mean for his age.
- No, i don't.
Hey, this is easier than
ropin' hogs! Yee-haw!
- He does have a tendency to showboat.
- Yahoo!
- Wow.
- There's Julie "The Cat'"Gaffney.
She won the state championship
for Maine three years in a row.
Well, we have a goalie.
Goldberg.
All right! Bring 'em on, man! i'm ready
for this! i'm the man! i'm the man!
Ohh.!
Uh, help.
Watch this.
Well, we...
could use a backup.
Isn't that that kid from the
Olympics? The figure skater?
Yup. Ken Wu.
What can I say?
I convinced him that hockey
had more of a future.
We put a stick in his hands
and nobody's been able to touch him.
Yeah. Show time!
- That guy's a teenager?
- ~ Don't you know that ~
~ Everything's on fire, yeah ~
- Uh, yeah. Hormones.
- He's a goon.
- Ohh!
- C'mon, Tex! Sing it with me!
- Uh-uh! No!
- ~ Everything ~
- Here ya go, sweetie!
- My kids don't play that kinda hockey.
i believe they're
called enforcers, Gordon.
- When you play iceland, you're gonna need him.
- My little man!
- Who does this guy
think he is?
- All right, that's it!
- Let me take care of this.
Everybody freeze!
Now, we didn't
come here to fight!
We came here to play hockey!
We're Team U.S.A.
You represent your country.
- That's right.
- Now, i want you-
To be all that you
can be, right?
Ya gotta raise yourself up,
guys! Ya got-
- All right, now. Let's
start with the scrimmage.
Great! Scrimmage!
You heard your coach! Now-
Hey. You don't need me here.
i've got an appointment anyway.
i've got to see Miss MacKay.
- She's the team tutor.
- Don?
Come on.
You'll get it back
at the end of the school term.
All right, Ducks.
Show 'em what you got!
Let's scrimmage!
- Great day for hockey, ain't it?
- Sure is, cowboy.
Yee-haw!
- Hey, man, take it easy! Slow down!
- Goldberg, look out!
Oh, no!
This guy's gotta
learn how to stop.
- Thanks for breaking my fall.
- Anytime.
- Let's go, defense!
- Whoa!
Come on!
Dig it out of there!
Let's go! Come on!
Haven't you guys been training
in the off-season?
You know, i knew
we forgot somethin'.
Good shot, Adam.
Way to show 'em.!
- How do you feel,
tough guy?
Ding! Round one.
Wait 'til you meet these kids.
They're just fantastic.
- Look out!
- It's Fulton.! Look out for his shot.!
What a bunch of wusses!
Oh!
Half of'em are ringers from various
parts of the U.S. Then the other half-
- Duck!
- That's right. The Ducks.
Hello? Mr. Tibbles?
Mr.. Tibbles?
Mr. Tibbles, can you hear me?
Mr. Tibbles, wake up.
Oh, Mr. Tibbles,
are you all right?
Oh, uh, i-i'll have the cheeseburger,
fries, and a chocolate shake, please.
i think he'll be okay.
We'll keep an eye on him.
Oh, i'm sorry. He didn't
have a chance to introduce us.
i'm Michele MacKay,
their tutor.
Hi, i'm Coach Bombay,
their coach.
- Who said we need a tutor? - Yeah.
Really. - i don't need no school.
Now, Miss MacKay,
we're America's team here.
Shouldn't we just
be concentrating on hockey?
May i suggest
optional attendance?
- i agree.
- Yeah. Good idea.
- Well, that's not a bad idea.
- Call me Goldberg.
Goldberg. Yes.
School will be optional.
However-
However, should you not attend,
you will not be eligible to play.
Oh, that's unfair.!
Man, can she do that?
Hey, is that a tattoo?
is it real?
- Get away from me.
- Yes, sir.
Well, i'm just here to tutor the kids and
provide them with a little adult supervision.
- Oh, my gosh!
- Oh!
- That was awesome. Are you okay?
- Yes.
All right.!
- Sorry.
- Yeah, sorry.
We're okay.
This is more crowded than
a truckload of goats.
Somebody better
watch their hands.
Yeah, someone licked me!
- Oh, i smell somethin'. Eewh.
- Eewh.
Goldberg!
- it wasn't me.
- No, it was me!
Thank you.
i don't know how to make
this any clearer.
You are a team.
And to win this thing,
you have to work as one.
Now as one, skate.
Whoa!
Everyone goes their own way,
everyone falls down.
Now get up and try it again.
- All right, all of you move to your right. Now.
- Who made you boss?
- Everyone to the left.
- Yeah, left guys. Come on.
- Aw, man.
- You guys can argue all you want...
but i am not untying you
until you move as one.
Now you're learning!
Communication! That's it!
Good, together.
Move together.
Charge! All right!
- Right turn!
- Turn right.
Yeah, that's it! That's it!
All right! Knock wood, Charlie.
You guys are startin' to look like
hockey players. i'm proud of ya, team.
You worked hard today.
But hockey
should also be fun.
- Rancher Dwayne.
- Yes, sir!
- Round me up some stray
cattle there. - Uh-oh.
- My pleasure!
- Whoa!
~ Together we stand
Divided we fall ~
~ Come on, people
Let's all get on the ball ~

- Oh! That's awesome!
- Hey, y'all. That's us!
- Duh, whatta ya know?
- Today,
it's a Wheaties box.
Tomorrow, it's video games, action
figures, lunch boxes. The sky is the limit.
Now,just to make sure
that everybody knows who you are...
try on one of these.
- Oh, that's so cool!
- Brought to you by those wonderful people at Hendrix...
for all your hockey needs.
Fulton, there you go. Coach.
Everybody take your own. I'm not
gonna give 'em out to everybody.
That's nice, Coach, but we're Ducks.
This stuff says "Hendrix" all over it.
Well, yeah, they're
our sponsors, Charlie.
So what?
Can't we be U.S.A. Ducks?
Or at least
keep our own colors?
it's business stuff, Charlie.
Don't worry about it.
- What'd ya think?
- i love it. it's cool.
Ancient Greece was the beginning
of Western Civilization.
See, in Greece, they didn't
have professional sports...
or Wheaties boxes.
So the athletes competed
for another reason.
- Anybody?
- Falafels?
- Ohh. Greg.
- You wish, Goldberg.
- Charlie?
- Pride.
That's right. The various
city-states waved their flags...
and wore
their home colors proudly.
Did America always dominate?
- Fulton.
- That's a good question.
- No. America wasn't
around back then.
- it's okay.
- Don't forget that compared to other countries...
America is still young,
still forming its own identity.
- America is a teenagerjust like you.
- Like us?
You bet.
A little awkward at times...
but always right there
on the verge of greatness.

Welcome to Los Angeles, California,
and theJunior Goodwill Games...
as teams from around the world arrive to
compete in both winter and summer events.
The U.S.A. is expected to
score well in the medal count...
especially in basketball,
swimming and hockey.
And there's Team U.S.A. hockey
led by Coach Gordon Bombay.
They're looking fit and anxious
to begin the competition.
Tonight's game matches
the second-seeded Team U.S.A...
against the tenth-seeded team,
Trinidad Tobago.
This marks the first game for Team
U.S.A. in this double-elimination...
winner-take-all
tournament.
Gordon Bombay looks to have his team well
in control here. They lead six to nothing.
This is sewn up tight!
All right! Yeah!
Yeah, high-five some more. Man, my
little brother could score on these guys.
- Go bother him, then. - Ha-ha!

- Look at those guys! Look at 'em!
They're the Bash Brothers!
Hey, ya got a girl
in the stands?
No. Scouts, man.
Look at 'em.
Don't worry about scouts, Adam.
Just play your best.
Team U.S.A. loses the puck
at center ice.
Here's Bellafonte across the
blue line with a great move.
Walks right down in front.
He shoots, he scores.!
Way to go, man!
Way to go!
Nearing the end of the game, Team
U.S.A. with it out at center ice.
Here's Connie Moreau. Moreau
stick-handling in the Trinidad zone.
Moreau still with it, moves around
a pileup, gives it to Kenny Wu.
Wu, the former figure skater, back behind
the net, ducks underneath the check.
Moves around the it.
It's a wraparound. He scores.!
All right, way to go.!
- That wasn't a game,
that was a statement!
Ladies and gentlemen,
Team U.S.A. hockey.
And the man chosen to lead
them to the gold, Gordon Bombay.
- Bring the bear up here. This
is Henry, the Hendrix bear.
- Hello, everyone.!
- Guys, I want you to come in, get some shots with the bear.
Big wave.! Big wave.!
Wave to everybody.!
- Hello, everybody! it's great to be here!
- Got that? Great.
Thanks a lot. Okay, we're gonna
open it up to questions. Yes.
Team U.S.A., how does
it feel competing...
on the international level
here in Los Angeles?
- Um-
- Feels good. Love it.
Coach Bombay, the Vikings from
iceland are the heavy favorite.
Their coach has already
guaranteed victory.
- How are you gonna handle them?
- Um... hard work.
i think our team is ready to go
up against the best in the world.
We're not worried about 'em.
Iceland may be tough, but, uh...
we're Team U.S.A. and
we're goin' all the way.
- Yeah.! All right, Coach.!
- Okay, that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you, everybody.
- Real good. Did good.
- Team U.S.A. 's going down.
That's where
you're going.
See you on the ice, Bombay!
That's, uh, Stansson.
Coach of the Iceland team.
He's wound a little tight.
Stansson from the N.H.L.? Wolf"The
Dentist" Stansson is coaching?
- You didn't tell me that.
- it's all right!
- That guy's a dentist?
- That was his nickname.
Played one year of pro,
collected more teeth than goals.
- He even punched out his coach.
- They ran him out of the league and the country.
What happened to freedom of
speech, huh? isn't this America?
That's his team?
Those guys are huge!
- One more thing- - He's
already told you what he thinks.
- Gordon.
- Thanks. How'd i do?
- Great. it was quite a circus, huh?
- it's all part of the game.
A giant polar bear with sunglasses
is part of hockey now?
i guess the game's
really changed.
Gordon, come on.
CNN, one on one.
CNN.
Gordon.! Just one question.!
One question.!
- Hello, there, missy.
How about a bear hug?
Tibbles, what are we
doin' here in Malibu?
This is your new place, man.
it's our way of saying "Thank you. "
You take care of Hendrix,
Hendrix is gonna take care of you.
i can't help feeling a little guilty.
Shouldn't i be closer to the team?
Whoa.
You know, they don't
need me 24 hours a day.

- Yeah.
Shh. Do it quiet.
All right.
Let me get the hand.

Hello.
Nice to meet you.
Kareem, i'd like you to meet
Gordon Bombay, coach ofTeam U.S.A.
- Hey, Gordon, how ya doin'?
- Glad to meet ya.
Coaching. Okay,
two words about that: Pat Riley.
What it is, it's a loafer.
And we'll call it
the Air Bombay loafer...
for kids who wanna coach.
You think there's enough kids
out there who wanna... coach?
Absolutely.
This don't look like
no Rodeo Drive to me.
No, that's Ro-day-o Drive.
You can't fool me. i saw it on
the sign. it says Rodeo Drive.
No, see, there's
an accent at- Never mind.
i don't get it. This is Beverly
Hills. Where's all the hills?
- Where's that 90210 school? What about the Hillbillies?
- Where are the movie stars?
Wasn't that the captain
from The Love Boat?
- Let's go check out some stores.
- Great. i gotta buy my mom a T-shirt.
- She'll love it.
- Yeah.
Let's think about it
and go get an espresso, okay?
Maybe they're not open.
Hey, there's a doorbell here.
i'm sorry. We do not allow
unsupervised children into the store.
- Can you make an exception?
- No, now go away or the police will be called.
if we were in Texas,
this wouldn't have happened.
- We'll find some other place.
Step back from the vehicle.
- You have activated
the theft-deterrent device.
- Yes, hello.
- Hi, we'd like four burgers. What do you want to drink?
You kids get outta here!
Quit playin' with that thing!
- I'm sorry.
We do not allow unsupervised-
i'm sure Uncle Aaron will be very upset to
hear we were treated with such disrespect.
Aaron? Aaron Spelling?
No, Hank Aaron.
Of course, Aaron Spelling.
Now, i want you to make yourselves
comfortable. Carole, beverages.
And i will be with you
in a moment.
- Gosh, this store sure is nice.
- Goldberg, my man.
- Cheers.

- Hey!
- You little brats don't ever come back into this store.!
Anti-children!
No, no, no. it's not a sneaker,
it's a street shoe.
Like coaches wear.
Yeah, come on in.
Sure, with a pump.
That'll work.
Go ahead, sit down.
We'll talk about it at dinner. Okay.
What's up?

When am i gonna get my chance?
Julie, Goldberg's
on a hot streak.
i gotta stick with him
as long as we're winning.

Just give it time.
You will show the world.

Okay?

Fulton, talk to 'em.
Uh, hey, ladies. Nice night
for a stroll, wouldn't you say?
That was a good one!
No curfew's
gonna keep us down.
- Yeah!
- ice cream.
Wait a minute. I thought
Iceland was covered with ice.
- No, it's very green.
- i thought Greenland was green.
- Greenland is covered with ice, and iceland is very nice.
- Ahh.
i imagine it'd be
like Minnesota, where you're from.
How do you know
where i'm from?
i asked around.
Okay.
Look at this.
She's an iceland chick.
What's he doin'with her?
Great coach we got.
All right, are we ready
for warm-ups?
- Let's go!
- Whoa! He's stylin'! Mr. Coach!
Yeah, all right.
All right.
- Nice jacket. Did you get
- two pairs of pants with that?
- Good night last night, Coach?
- Yeah, it was fine.
What'd ya do?
Oh, i... just watched some TV,
got to bed early.
But not without
a little dessert, right?
A little
ice cream, maybe?
Nice haircut.
What, ya lose a bet?
Live from Los Angeles, welcome
to theJunior Goodwill Games.
Tonight's matchup, Team U.S.A.
faces off against Team iceland.
- Cakewalk.
- We have with us Greg Goldberg, goaltender for Team U.S.A.
Greg, what is it gonna take to beat
these feisty icelanders tonight?
i think it'll take a supreme
individual effort by me, Greg Goldberg.
- Let's play hockey, gentlemen.
- Okay, cut it.
Hi, everybody.
Welcome to today's game.
This is a very important matchup,
Team U.S.A. against Iceland...
in what could be a preview
of the championship game.
Iceland, coached by
Wolf"The Dentist'"Stansson.
He'll be taking on
Gordon Bombay.
Good luck, there,
Coach.
You'll sure need it.
What does that mean?
You'll find out.
Come on, fool! Get up!
- You ran at him unprovoked.
- Huh?
- Calm down, son. You're out of the game.
- Give me a break!
You're throwin' him out? You can't do
that! it's three seconds into the game!
Oh, man.
Come and get it.
Wake up, defense.
Can't do this all myself.
Hey, Goldberg! if that puck was a
cheeseburger, you'd stop it! Ha-ha-ha!
Yee-haw!
- Pass the puck, Dwayne! Come on!
- Dwayne, give me the puck.!
- Pass it to Fulton!
- Dwayne, pass it!
- Look out, Dwayne!
- Yee-haw! Aah!
Oh, man!
i can't believe this is
happening! i should be out there!
...missing big Dean Portman,
it's one-nothing iceland.
iceland outhitting and
outskating Team U.S.A...
all over the ice
in the first period.
Here's Gunnar Stahl
again for Iceland.
Team U.S.A. can't stop him.
On the backhand, saved by Goldberg.
Captain Adam Banks has it for Team
U.S.A. He gets knocked head over heels.
Team U.S.A. still with the puck.
Luis Mendoza, he can really fly.
Mendoza across the blue line. He
gets tripped, slides into the boards.
Come on, ref,
call something.
- We're in trouble, Ken. What can you do for us?
- Let's see.
Uh, a triple aerial
with a Double Hamill Camel...
that should split the D, then a
pirouetting half-toe-touch for the goal.
- Show it to me, son.
- Come on, Kenny. Get us back in the game.
i'm sure
you can do it, Ken.
Aah!
Aw, man. Aw.
Aw.
Was that it?
Please give me one more
chance to get those guys!
They've got to get back into
this game. Iceland with the puck.
Here's Olaf Sanderson
right down the middle.
- Sanderson over to Stahl.
He scores.!
Where's our concentration?
You guys are runnin' around like a bunch
of chickens with your heads cut off!.
- We're doin' our best.
- Well, your best isn't good enough anymore.
Blow this game and we are one
loss away from elimination.
You guys might want to go home
early, but i sure as heck don't.
My, that was inspiring.
Four-nothing, Iceland, as we
head for the final period.
I hope Bombay's got some magic up his sleeve,
because he's getting manhandled tonight.
No! No.
You're off, Goldberg!
Ah, thank you.
- Hey, good luck, goalie. You're gonna need it.
- Thanks, Goldberg.
- Sending in a woman to do a man's job.
- Don't break a nail.
i'm sorry, boys, but can you
help me with my pads, please?
Yeah. Oof!.
Intent to injure.!
You're out of the game.!
- See ya around, fellas.
Aw, geez.
Thanks for the breather.
- Fulton! Get out there and blast one!
- Go on in!
Fulton Reed on the ice
for Team U.S.A.
- He's open to the blue line.
- Fulton, fire it in there!
Reed winding up-
Whoa.! Glove save by Seggi.
Oh, what a save.! He'll have an
imprint of a puck in his palm...
after that one.!
- Hi.
- i know how you feel.
Here's Banks,
starts onto the ice...
moves along the left wing side,
now moves into the center, but-
A spinning move.! A great
move to the blue line.
Banks all alone.
He scores.!
Yeah, we got one!
Hey!
Come on! Relax!
Take it easy!
- Calm down, son.
- Are you okay?
- i'm all right. i'm okay.
- Are you sure?
He scored!
- Sit down. Right in there.
- Sanderson!
In my country,
we call that a love tap.
i want a piece of you,
Sanderson! You're mine!
- Oh, you think it's funny?
- Come on, get down!
i want you!
Hey, man, don't touch me.!
C'mon, Charlie!
That's it!
- iceland!
- Olaf.
Ja, Coach.
- Good game, Coach.
- Thanks, ref.
Damn it!
Twelve to one, huh?
Twelve to one.
Ya think Hendrix is interested
in backing a loser?
Hey, how are ya?
You're only good to us
if you win.
Don, i'm- i've-
i- i've been good to you, man.
i gave ya a real shot.
A real shot
to be somebody...
and this is
how you repay me.
We just didn't have
the magic tonight.
Well, you better get the damn
magic, and you better get it fast.
Or i'm out of a job, and you're on your
way back to Palookaville, Minnesota...
shoveling snow
and sharpening skates.
Have a nice night.
Twelve to one.
You know what word comes to
mind when you think of that? Hmm?
Pathetic.!
You guys were brought
here to play hockey.
- What about you?
- What about me,Jesse?
Coach Stansson knew everything
about us. They were ready for us.
And you spend your time driving around in
convertibles talking to those sponsor fools.
Or hanging with the iceland lady.
We saw you two Saturday night.
Eating ice cream with
the enemy, huh, coach?
What? What are you talking
about? What's going on?
Hey. Hey, what i do is none of
your business. is that clear?
Don't take those pads off.
Everyone stay in your gear.
We have practice.
Tonight?
This isn't
very much fun, Coach.
Who said it was
supposed to be fun?
You did, when you
coached the Ducks.
Well, i don't see
any Ducks here, Charlie.
All i see is Team U.S.A.
one loss away from elimination.
Twenty more sprints!
Let's go!
Line up! Come on, let's go!
Line up, Charlie!
Let's go! Keep you here
all night if i have to.
Not my best...
Luis.
Sorry.
All right, let's go!
Team?
Hello!
Hey, guys.
- Hello?
- I canceled their practice.
- What're ya talkin' about? Where are they?
- They needed a day off. Trust me.
i need 'em here
to practice!
Well,
they need to rest.
You've been running
those children ragged.
They can barely stay awake in class.
They're calling you Captain Blood.
i am preparing these kids for
battle. Can you understand that?
We win the gold,
we go on to bigger things.
- Bigger things?
- That's right!
Please!
Gordon, it's a game!
You said it yourself. Games
should be fun. Remember?
- And hold, two, three- - Coach
isn't here. Why do we have to be?
We have a game tonight.
We have to work out.
i say mutiny.
Who's with me?
Goldberg,
i'm too tired to mutiny.
Come on, guys, it's not like we
couldn't use the conditioning.
- Speak for yourself, babe.
- Her name is Julie, not "babe. "
- Don't tell me how to talk, rich boy!
- Hey, Portman, chill!
Hey, you want a piece of this?
Yo, Team U.S.A., what are you gonna
do today, a million jumping jacks?
- This kid's crazier than me. Forget about him. Look, Fulton!
- Hey, chill!
Hey, man,
i'm gettin' sick of you!
i'm gettin' sick of seeing the U.S.A.
represented by a bunch of whining babies.
Too bad you can't back up
that mouth.
Me and my boys can take you
anytime, anywhere.
- i don't see no "boys. "
- i got 'em waitin'.
Grab your gear and let's go play
some schoolyard puck.
- Or maybe you forgot what it's like to play for real pride.
- You got a pass?
- Come on, it's not too far, you little wimps.
- Come on.
- What are you doin'? Get off!. You comin' or not?
- Let's go.
My little brother Russ here has been telling
me that you have been chokin' big time.
Your brother's
got a big mouth.
Uh-oh.
He does, doesn't he?
- Oh, boy.
- We thought we'd call you all to see what you got.
We know you can talk to the
press and sign autographs.
- We can do more than that.
- Yeah? We can teach you to play like the real Team U.S.A.
What would you know
about it?
~Party people ~
You gotta earn every inch.

And then you take a few breaths,

and do it again!
- ~Let me hear you say ~

- Ah, you like that, huh?
- Yeah.
That's my knucklepuck. it's hard to be
accurate but it drives goalies crazy.
Let's play!

- All right!
- Come on, go get 'em.! You guys do it, okay?
- All right.!
- Play hard!
Go, U.S.A.
Go get 'em.
This is not a place
for a coach.
So who's looking
after the shop?
We are closed.
First time in ten years.
i saw the iceland game
on television.
- Who was that man in the suit with the wet hair? Was it raining?
- it's a style,Jan.
You looked like
you just got out of the shower.
You came 2,000 miles to make fun of me?
You could have done this over the phone.
On TV, you looked like
a man who needs a friend.
You don't understand.
Gordon...
when i told the Goodwill Committee
who you were...
i did not talk
to them about your good looks.
I didn't tell them
you would win at any cost.
i told them you were a man
who loves the game.
And i told them you were a man
who could teach the kids...
about more than just
winning or losing.
I told them you were
the Minnesota Miracle Man.
And only you
could teach them to fly.
So be that man.
Be that man, Gordon.
Hey, team.! Hey, team.
We're gonna be great today, right?
- Where's Gordon?
- You tell us.
- i don't believe this.
- Team U.S.A. i'm sorry.
Without a coach behind the bench,
you'll forfeit the game.
- But you can't do that.
- We have one.
Miss MacKay.!
Hey, Charlie,
what's up?
You have to pretend you're a coach
or we forfeit the game.
- Where's Coach Bombay?
- Pretend or we're out of the tournament.
But i don't know anything
about coaching.
Here she is, our coach; Coach MacKay.
Yeah.
- Come on, Coach MacKay.
- What are you waitin' for, ice to freeze? Let's play!
Let's go.
Yes!
Face-off at center ice.
Germany wins the draw.
Comes across the U.S.A. blue line.
Germany on the right wing side.
Down to big Klaus Stabias.
He shoots.!
And a save by Goldberg.
Great save by Goldberg.
As Germany is really
throwing their weight around.
Oh! We look tired.
We need to, uh... trade places.
- What?
- New players.
- Oh, say, "Change it up. "
- Change it up.
- Scream it!
- Change it up!
Cool.
- We're late in the period
with a face off coming up.
Look who finally
shows up.
- Just ignore him. Averman,
take the face-off. - All right.
- What do we got to lose?
- Respect. He'll dump us the minute it's all over.
Come on in!
Let's go, come on.
Thanks.
Team.
Guys.
I was wrong.
And i'm sorry.
i forgot about the team.
And the team is all I have.
All I want...
is another chance.
Just one more shot.
i'm back.
Okay?
Believe me.
Together now.
Come on,Jesse.
- Jesse,just do it, man!
- All right, let's go! Flying "V"!
Hall joined by his teammates behind
the Team U.S.A. net in the third period.
They start back out
and they form a "V';
I've heard of this before but I've never
seen it. It's the Flying "V'"led byJesse Hall.
Hall up to center ice. Hall with
it toward the Germany blue line.
Hall
- Shot by Averman. He scores.!
Yes!
i've had a lot of big distractions
since i've been here in L.A.
This is a distraction.
- Nice haircut, Coach.
- Looks familiar. i know that guy.
This is a fire in a barrel.
This is a distraction in a
fire in a barrel. Any questions?
Good job, Coach.
All right!
Wooo!
All right, Coach.!
We've got a lot of work to do. We've gotta
study our opponents and study ourselves.
We have to learn
from our mistakes.
You all have special skills.
Now we have to refine them.
Luis, your speed is a great weapon.
Now you must learn to harness it.
Let's do it.
- Whoa!
- We need to get back to basics.
That's it. Dwayne, hustle. We're gonna
be a lean, mean, fighting machine.
Move that big butt.
Go!
- Hey, how you feelin' today, Goldberg?
- Lean and mean.
Banks.!
Show me something, now.! That's it.!
Good. Good.
Hey, Banks,
let's go!
Comin'.
i'll be right there.
And no matter what, we'll work
together to overcome every obstacle.
- Nowjust think how you'd play with two good wrists.
- Coach.
it's just a little sore.
i'm okay.
i should have spotted this sooner.
Sorry, man, i wasn't doin' my job.
Coach, i'm fine.
i can play, i swear.
Okay.
Here.
Let's find out.
The other hand.
Now rotate it.
i have to bench you.
No!
You can't do that.
- Adam, you could injure yourself permanently.
- You can't bench me.
i gotta play. All the scouts are
here watching me. This is my shot.
You're young and you're gonna
have plenty of shots, believe me.
But my dad's
counting on me.
I'm sorry.
Hey.
My dad worked a lot
when i was a kid.
So when he made it
to a game...
i wanted so bad
to score 100 goals for him.
i spent half the game a nervous
wreck, my stomach in knots.
That's how i feel.
Before he died,
my dad told me...
that his happiest times...
were watching me skate on this
pond we had behind our house.
He didn't need me
to score 100 goals for him.
He was proud of me
'cause i was his son...
and i did my best.
I'm sure that's how
your dad feels.
i know it is.
Thanks, Coach.
All right. Let's go
get that wrist X-rayed.
Come on.
- That's the way.
- We will work hard and we're gonna succeed.
Nothing will bring us down.
If we fall,
we'll get up and try it again.
Way to get over
on your edge there, Connie!
Good, Portman, good.
Soft hands.
Coach. Coach, i know with Banks
out, we got a roster slot open.
- Yeah?
- You know how I always told you I'd make a better coach than a player?
I did some scouting
for us. Come on in.!
- Russ Tyler. Coach Bombay.
- Hiya, Coach.
Russ Tyler, huh.
Well, Russ,
what can you do for the team?
You never heard
of my knucklepuck?
Knucklepuck?
No.
- U.S.A. leading Russia two-to-one
here in the third period. - Over here.
Russ Tyler, Team U.S.A. 's newest member from
Los Angeles calling for the puck. He gets it.
- it's knucklepuck time.
- He winds up.
He shoots.
He scores.!
Yeah!
- Yeah!
That's my stuff!.
I told him no visitors, but he
wanted to congratulate you anyway.
That's Wayne Gretzky.
Can i shake your hand?
How ya doin'?
- This is The Great One.
- Wayne's fine.
- Say, hockey.
- Hockey!
Powered by a one goal victory
over Russia...
Team U.S.A. hockey advances to the
finals of theJunior Goodwill Games...
where they'll go up against the
top-seeded team from Iceland.
- Coach, shouldn't we have our hockey gear on?
- Yeah?
- Guys, this is our last team practice,
which means- - The return of Captain Blood.
No.
- it means... let's have some fun.
- All right!
- Easy, easy now.
- Whoa.
- Good.
- i love it.
i can skate.
Yes, he can skate.
Oh.
Playtime is over.
We have the ice now.
You and your little rink rats
must leave.
We're right here,
Coach.
The only thing little
was your career in the pros.
Gordon, no,
let's go.
Well, at least I had a shot.
I was there.
You were a disgrace.
All right, team,
we're outta here.
- Let's go, i said! Come on!
- Can you still move on the ice?
Well, please,
play a little with me.
Show me the famous triple deke
your daddy taught you.
Or was it that
old geezer over there?
Marria.
Three bar. First one to hit
both posts and the crossbar.
- Have to take it out past the blue line.
- i know the game.
Come on, Bombay.
Come on!
That's it. That's it.!
Yeah.!
News flash.
That wasn't even
my triple deke.
One more post and you go home crying. By
the way, Stansson, you owe me a beach ball.
It's all right.
Get your coach off the ice.
We have to practice now.
Stay back!
Back, back, back.
Live from the Arrowhead Pond
in Anaheim, California...
it's Team U.S.A. versus Iceland in the
hockey finals of theJunior Goodwill Games.

Miller along with Jacques Berman.

Coach.

and the pain was gone.
Adam, i'm sorry,

He can have my spot.

for the team.
Let me do it.
Charlie, i need you on the bench,
+coaching right there with me.
Take a deep breath.
Here we go.
Now the two teams gather
at their respective benches.

And off the face-off,
Averman gets knocked down.
Iceland physically dominated
the first game between two teams...
and they'll try
to do it again tonight.
Guy Germaine gets checked down
in the corner.

Iceland with a one-nothing lead.
Throwing everything they have at U.S.A.
Team U.S.A. has to find a way

stronger, faster. They got more facial hair.

Referee taking Robertson
over to the penalty box.
What are they gonna call this
penalty? It's two minutes for roping?
That's a new one on me. We're
at the end of the second period.
Iceland has a commanding
four-to-one lead.
This isn't a hockey game;
it's a circus.
- Did you all enjoy that?
- Yeah!
So did they, because they're still three
points up and we're one period away from defeat.
- if we can't beat them, we might as well keep our pride.
- Yeah.
Jesse, that's not pride.
Sure, when Dwayne roped that
big oaf, part of me cheered.
But, guys, i've been there.
i know how you feel.
i wanted to cream that jerk that busted
my knee when i played in the minors.
And i really, really wanted to go
after Stansson for that cheap shot.
But you know what?
My knee will heal.
And if i become
someone i'm not...
if i sink
to their level...
well, then,
i lost more than my knee.
You understand?
Yeah.
We're not goons.
We're not bullies.
No matter
what people say or do...
we have to be ourselves.

- Because we are Ducks.
- And ducks fly together.
- That's right,Jan.
- And just when you think they're about
to break apart- - Ducks fly together!

the sky is black- - Ducks fly together!
When the roosters are crowing and the
cows are spinning circles in the pasture-
- Um. Okay.
- Ducks fly together!
And when everyone says it can't be done
- Ducks fly together.
Now, new Ducks...
and old Ducks must unite
under a new banner.
And i thought perhaps
something like this.
Wooo!
Here to start the third period,
what team is this?
It's not Team U.S.A. Yes, it
is. They've got on new uniforms.
They're wearing the logo of the
duck. I've never seen this before.
Yeah! Come on!
I'vejust gotten word that there is
no rule against changing uniforms.
- Come on. This is ridiculous.
- Well, Gordon Bombay's old team was called the "Ducks';..
and I guess we've got
the U.S.A. Ducks out there now.

Time running out here
in the third period.
The Ducks with the puck. They're still down
by a goal. They're back in their own zone.
