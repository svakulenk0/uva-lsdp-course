Lou:
Man: Uh, we're going
to just touch you up.
- Okay, Mr. Dorchen?
- Hey.
Do I need nipple Rouge?
Man: Uh, can we get...
I don't, uh...
Do I need any nipple Rouge?
Man: Yeah.
Touch up his nipples, please.
What kind of brush is that?
Is that rabbit fur?
Narrator: Lou Dorchen,
the legendary lead singer
of the metal supergroup
motley Lue,
who burst onto the world stage
out of nowhere
to become the very definition
of a rock God.
Livin' the dream with
high school sweetheart
So how did the ultimate party
animal get the inspiration
to build the most innovative,
forward-thinking
I don't have to tell
you where I got
my inspiration from,
first of all.
Because that's called
"intellectual property"
and I can copyright that shit.
Just like I copyrighted
the word "well,"
so you can't even say "well"
without paying me money.
- Man: Uh, well, um...
- You owe me money.
Narrator: Lou Dorchen's
best friend is yet another
American success story,
music mogul Nick Webber.
Ever since I wrote
back in '86,
I've been on a roll.
A lot of stations still
playin' gin and juicey juice.
You oughta know.
Feelin' like teen spirit.
I guess you could say
I take from a lot of artists.
Take my inspiration
from a lot of artists.
I don't...
I don't take their stuff.
That's... who would do that?
- Yeah. Ask me anything.
- Man: Okay.
How's your
relationship with your father?
Narrator: Still struggling to find his
own place in the world, Jacob Dorchen
comments on his father's
game-changing innovation.
He didn't invent
Goo... lougle.
He couldn't invent his way
out of a fucking paper bag.
And that's...
That's not a turn of phrase,
that's anecdotal evidence.
He got caught in a giant paper
bag a couple weeks ago.
Adam... Adam yates.
Yes, he rounds out
He made it real big
with his bestselling novel,
Jacuzzi Timelord.
But Adam, he's, uh... he's off
on an experiential journey.
I got a feeling
we'll see him again.
I got a feeling.
that tonight's gonna be
a good night
just came to me.
Narrator:
seemed to kick-start
their lives into high gear.
We turned to high school pal,
Gary Winkle.
I bet you guys didn't know that I was
supposed to go on that trip, huh?
- I stood outside all day...
-
...but they never showed.
Left me hanging.
You know what
I got that weekend?
Chlamydia from
the batting cages.
My best buddies go up
the Mountain as regular Joes.
Come down fucking rich.
I mean, how did that happen?
I mean, at the end of the day,
I'm just a simple guy like you
who had a couple
of great ideas
that happen to make him
a bunch of money. That's it.
I mean,
how was I supposed to know
that it would change the fabric of our existence?
I couldn't.
You know, I couldn't,
unless I had some sort of...
well, don't listen, huh?
Don't be listening
listening, glistening
in the sun I'm glistening
when I'm laying down
in the sun
I put on some lotion
no, no, no
cut! Let's reset. Do it again.
One word, Nick.
Fucking amazing...
Don't fuck with my groove,
Terry.
- Jacob: Hey, Nick.
- Rip off any pop stars lately?
-
For your information, today
I recorded an original piece.
Really?
Okay, it was that
Lisa loeb song.
Well, as much of it
as I could remember.
The lyrics I made up
were original.
Listen, Nick, I get it.
You don't have
any natural talent.
All I know is that hot tub
made me a king.
It's my duty to live up
to the throne.
All right,
I can't see you right now,
but I'm gonna assume you're putting
"King" and "Throne" in quotes.
Hey, Nick, I'm sorry.
I'm not trying to be a dick.
Are you coming to Lou's party?
I gotta talk to Courtney.
I'm... I don't know.
- How is Courtney?
Oh, really?
Still fighting, huh?
Why don't you just write her
a Josh Groban song?
-
-
Hello?
Oh, shit!
Cocaine!
- Fuck!
-
Oh, God. Oh, my God.
Don't fucking sneak up
on me like that, huh!
Knock on something.
You took most of the doors out
and put beads up, Lou.
What am I supposed
to fucking knock on?
What do you want?
Put it down!
What, do you want
a round of applause?
"Thank you, Jacob,
for making sure we don't starve to death.
"Even though
this is completely ridiculous
"and inappropriate,
what we're doing."
You're welcome, mom and dad.
I'm just happy that you guys are happy.
What the fuck are
you still doing here?
Today's my birthday,
by the way.
- Happy Birthday.
- Oh, thanks, mom.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I got you... I got you something.
It'll be here tomorrow,
via Fedex.
- Right.
- Daddy's little buddy is
turning into
daddy's big buddy.
I'm going to help you out.
It's not really my birthday.
Do you know what day it is?
Mmm...
Okay. Enjoy your shit.
The sooner you choke to death on it,
the sooner I get all this.
Any other questions,
or is this interview over?
Don't let the lack of a door
hit you on the way out.
He just
gets me so mad.
- So who is he?
- That's my Butler.
And our son, consequently.
Oh, my God. Right.
Lisa Loeb?
Oh, my God. I can't believe
Nick Webber knows
the name of the cat wrangler.
Yeah. Crazy, right?
You know,
I just have to tell you,
I really love this song
so much.
- It feels so personal.
- Mmm.
It's almost...
Violating.
I'm so sorry.
Lou: Yeah!
Nailed it!
All rise!
Penis court is now in session!
The honorable
Judge Lou dorchen presiding.
Uh, Mr. Dorchen, could we get
this board meeting started?
Yeah. Brad, do your thing.
Ladies and gentlemen...
- Lougle is at a crossroads.
- Whoo!
We did it, guys!
We got to the crossroads!
Our competitors lycos and
geocities are crushing us.
Those guys are fucking nerds,
Brad.
What about yahoo,
huh? Where are they?
Yahoo? What's yahoo?
Exactly.
As your head of R&D,
I have to tell you
that lougle cannot continue
down this path.
Well, that's why I moved us
to new Orleans, Brad,
The Silicon Valley
of the South.
Huh?
Oh, shit! Shit!
Susan, look, turn around.
Turn around, right now!
Susan, quick, quick, quick!
I'm not going to look, Lou.
Susan, I promise it's not
a dick and balls this time.
I swear to God.
Look, look, look!
Dick and balls! You looked
at a dick and balls!
I burned you.
I can't believe
I let you talk me
I was one of
"30 under 30."
Really?
I was on track
to be "20 under 40,"
but now I'm
"zero under fuck me"!
You fucked me, Lou.
You fucked my whole life.
My brother works at the NSA
and I work for a Mad Man.
is a great show.
Sometimes I wish
I could just...
Okay, okay. Looks like
you're hungry for an idea.
So why doesn't Uncle Lou give
you guys a little taste, huh?
If you combine the right
amounts of nitrotrinadium
with specifically heated water
in a specialized basin,
you get
the elements necessary
for time travel!
Boom! Shotgun to the dick!
I'm gonna be in the lab,
trying to save this company.
Yeah!
Why are all these people here?
Are we having another seance?
Yeah.
Every day's a seance, baby.
Every day's a seance.
I fucking hate you
so much, Lou.
I fucking hate you, too, baby.
Courtney, it's not a big deal.
Well, maybe it's not
a big deal to you,
but she's my only sister,
and we never go visit her.
- It's the grammys.
- It's always the grammys.
It's not always the grammys.
Sometimes it's the grammys.
Oh, wow. Look at you.
Every fucking year, Lou?
Hey, enough with this
dad stuff. Call me Lou.
Why do I have to pretend
to be your Butler?
You are my Butler.
No, Lou, just 'cause
my room's near the bar
and I'm good
at receiving guests and...
Holy fuck, I'm your Butler.
Wait... hey, hey, Lou,
what do you think about,
maybe this summer, you know,
I can work with you at lougle?
Listen, this is what
I'll do for you, okay?
If we ever come up
with a division where
you sit on the couch and masturbate
while playing video games,
I'll get you an interview.
You started
an interactive porno division.
We have that.
Even the retarded Venn Diagram
you just mentioned, it exists.
Listen, you are a key part
of this operation, Jacob.
Really?
You're my Chief Mixologist!
Yay.
Bloop.
I love you, buddy.
Hey, Courtney.
Your tits look fantastic!
Eat shit, Lou.
She's one
of the good ones, man.
Come on. Let's get a drink.
Jeez. The place
is like a deathtrap, huh?
Just lousy with statues,
and the...
Not a lot of coats, right?
Not a lot of coats.
Can I take your jacket?
Oh, no, no, no. I'm actually
kind of "on the job" tonight.
It's my dad's party,
he runs lougle.
What do you do?
You know,
I'm just kind of a Jack-of-all-trades.
- So you're the Butler.
- No!
Come on. Do I look like
a Butler to you?
You look exactly
like a Butler.
Goddamn, it's good
to see you, man.
You, too, buddy.
Man. That tub, huh?
Really turned it all around.
It's the best thing that
ever happened to me.
You ever wish we could
go back for one more dip?
You know, tweak some things?
Use time travel
for more important reasons.
Too bad the tub is gone.
Yeah.
Too bad.
Oh, fuck.
Sorry.
What the fuck? Lou...
Nick-Nack-Paddywhack!
Give a dog a what?
Gary Winkle.
Look at this. Look,
Lou spilled his drink on me
so I don't have
to talk to you.
Good looking out.
Okay,
just laying it all out there.
Where are me and you right now
on a scale of, like,
"dinner and a movie"
to "tropical sex vacation"?
We're on the "it's never,
ever going to happen" part of the scale.
- So, like a four.
- One and a half.
- Mmm-hmm.
- Minus the half.
What are you selling, Gary?
What? No love for Gary Winkle?
Okay, but it is a sound investment this time.
I'm telling you, man.
No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.
It is only 12 blocks
from the river.
Pristine lot.
You can build an office tower,
nightclub, combo,
whatever the fuck.
Okay, I get it, man, I get it.
I get it. I'm a loser.
Okay, I'm always
going to be a loser.
I didn't magically turn it all
around after that ski trip.
All I got is this
piece of land,
and I know
it's a piece of shit, okay?
But it's...
It can be our piece of shit.
Not interested. Pass.
Bruce buffer:
Coming to you
from the heart of the bayou.
We've grown quite a bit
over the years, haven't we?
Some of us have
achieved our dreams.
Others have found
new dreams to chase.
You know, I bet...
I bet there's not a person
in this room who,
given the chance to do it
all over again
would do it any differently.
Am I right?
- Am I right?
-
Hmm.
And if you believe that...
If you truly believe that
in your heart of hearts,
well, then,
You're all a bunch
of fucking morons!
Genius.
Life is about do-overs, okay?
And if you see
your second chance
peeking its dick around
a corner, snatch it!
Grab it! Take my advice.
Look at the people
you love most in this world,
then you tell them
to go fuck themselves.
Because life is about
number one.
Lou-no!
So come on,
it's a party, right?
Let's all get nude and fuck!
-
-
Man: Move!
About time someone manned up
and shot the bastard.
- Holy shit, he's been shot.
- In the dick!
Shit! It's bad!
Somebody call an ambulance!
- Nick.
- Yeah, buddy.
You got your hand on my penis!
I'm applying direct pressure!
You don't have
to touch it that hard.
My hand is acting
as a Tourniquet!
You work his dick. Whatever.
No, no! Lou, Lou!
Stay with me!
Stay with me.
Look at me. Look at me.
Who shot you?
Chux... Zedo.
Chuck Zito? That motherfucker!
- I think he's saying "Tuxedo".
- Tuxedo?
God, it hurts so bad.
Who the fuck's
wearing a tuxedo?
What? What?
Okay, first of all,
this isn't a tuxedo,
this is a morning suit.
It's way more casual.
Mmm-hmm.
Don't you watch
I was standing right there beside you!
I didn't fuckin' shoot him!
I want my dick back!
Lou's gonna fuckin' die!
He's out of time!
No, he's not.
We'll give him more time.
- What?
- Grab his arms.
Oh, God, I take it back!
I take it back!
I don't want a shotgun
to the dick!
It hurts so much!
Oh, God! Oh, God!
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Hang on. Trust me.
Whoa.
Holy shit.
- I know, right?
- How?
He stole it.
I stole time!
I stole the whole ski lodge!
Check it out.
Pure Nitrotrinadium.
Lou got it from the Russians.
He told them he's gonna build them a bomb.
Nick: Classic Lou.
Yeah. They've never seen
All right. Everybody, get in.
A little help here.
Jacob: Come on, Lou,
you got to earn it.
Adam's trench coat?
What the fuck is this?
Is Adam here?
Nick: Stay with me, violator.
Where's my hair?
It's where my power lies.
Fuck your fucking wig.
We gotta go back in time and stop
the killer before he shoots Lou.
No.
It's how it works.
We get blackout drunk,
we hallucinate,
we wake up back in time.
Don't mess
with a winning formula, huh?
Don't be a fuckin' pussy!
Guys, I feel fucking great!
I think it worked.
Jacob: Lou's not breathing.
Nick: I think he's gone.
Nick, Nick, Nick!
Help, help, help!
Nick: Oh, shit.
- Lou, Lou.
- Lou. Lou!
Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck.
I guess we were too late.
Life is fucking weird,
you know?
I spent so much time
hating him.
And now that he's gone,
I can't help but feel...
Love.
No. Not love. Don't be stupid.
Respect?
No, that's still
way too strong a word.
Admiration?
I mean, there's nothing
admirable about him.
Well, I mean, he's your dad.
Honor, maybe?
Not honor. I mean,
that falls kind of with respect and admiration.
Maybe just kind of a...
Just a general sense of...
Missing, you miss him.
- Yeah, I miss him.
- Ah, you miss him. Yeah, yeah.
I motherfucking miss him.
What're you doing? You up
in heaven? Raping angels?
Good for you, buddy.
- Oh, God.
- What the fuck?
I saw this on
- The bowels evacuate when the body dies.
- Oh.
That smells like hatred.
This is gonna get worse
before it gets better.
- My dick! My dick!
-
It worked! Holy shit! Look!
Look, look!
That's a good-looking
dick to me!
My dick is back!
How far back did we go?
I don't know.
We put a big dryer in so we
don't have to time travel naked.
This is different.
Lou: It's like a Scandinavian
gay bar.
Looks like a Miami Ikea.
Dude, it looks amazing.
I mean, look how classy it is.
It's like a museum.
Who...
Who is this?
- I think it's Jacob.
-
Why am I bald?
What did you do?
I didn't... I didn't do that.
You look like a pedophile
dressed you.
You look like
a Jewish Jason Statham.
You look like Michael chiklis
fucked big daddy warbucks,
who fucked Lex Luthor.
That's what it is.
And... and...
Who's the little doggie?
What's he do... what's he
just doing there like this?
Why aren't you fucking
that doggie?
Why would I be fucking
the dog?
Both: Power over nature.
Sophie: Hey, you.
Is that the coat-check girl?
Boobs.
Hey, how are you?
I didn't know you had company.
- Yeah...
- Hey, Nick.
'Sup?
What's he doing here?
This is my house.
Think that'll hold
you till later?
Yeah, I'm sure.
- Bye, Nick.
- Bye.
- See you at the club?
- Right.
That coat-check girl is rude.
I like her.
I think it's pretty obvious
what's going on here, right.
What?
Alternate universe.
Like
Both:
-  You're a fucking nerd
-  Nerd
-  Nerd
-  And no one likes you

Thank you, Mr. Dorchen.
Male announcer 1:
Choozy Doozy.
I think I may be Mr. Dorchen.
- What? No.
- I think this is my house.
- No way.
- I think he's right, Lou.
- That's impossible.
- You heard it.
- It just answered me.
- Uh-uh!
Male announcer 2:
the daily show
Hey!
Welcome to the daily show.
Tonight's guest,
dame Jennifer Lawrence
streepin' it real.
Hey, how do they get
the people to be on this show?
between two self-driving
smart cars in new Detroit.
President Neil Patrick Harris
has called
for greater regulation
of the industry,
This show's still got it.
Holy shit. We went 10 years
into the future.
Whoa.
I'm distinguished.
Oh, I should shave this,
right?
Yeah, that's not a good look.
This is so smooth,
I don't think I went bald.
I think this is a choice,
like Andre Agassi or Bruce Willis or something.
You don't look anything like
either of those two people.
For one,
they're fit and handsome
and you're neither
of those things.
You look like a turtle
crawled out of his shell.
Fuck you for making me bald.
You look like an orchestra
conductor for stray cats.
You look like you give
lectures on public access.
You look like
a grown-up gerber baby.
Lou: You look like an egg
gave birth to another egg.
You look like
Gandalf the poor.
You look like
you advise Lando Calrissian.
That's a good one.
You look like the guy that owns the
one house that ruins the whole street.
Have I bombed anything,
you think?
You look like you've never
made a correct decision.
Ever.
I have definitely given
a back-alley blowjob.
I gotta admit
I kinda like this.
I want to hit you
into the corner pocket.
Now I know why the coat-check
girl didn't like me.
I look like fucking shit.
So far so good
on this future shit, huh?
Yeah. You know what?
I don't feel like anything
bad's going to happen.
Hey, check it out. I found all
the gear from the painting.
- Cool, huh?
- Whoa.
What happened to the bottom
of your suit?
That pesky little doggie
eat it?
It's called fashion, Lou.
You look like...
Nope, not doing any more
"you look like."
We did it on the stairs. We
did it in front of the mirror.
It'd be tacky to do it
a third time.
Anyway, do you guys
want some fresh clothes?
I got a whole closet
full of stuff.
I love this shirt.
My shit is fly.
Weren't you listening
to my speech, dude?
Always pack a bag.
Hey, is that...
- No. It is not.
- How did you get that?
- I didn't get...
- I know what it...
I saw what it said.
It doesn't say anything!
Was that the Cincinnati box?
- Don't say that out loud.
- It might hear you.
You're really never going to
tell me what's inside that box?
Okay, we'll tell you.
We'll tell him.
- I'm going to tell him.
- Nick: Lou.
It's the declaration of independence
with a map on the back.
- Our family's chosen.
- Yep.
That's just the plot of that
movie
That's raiders of the Lost
Ark. You're not even tryin'.
I mean,
that's not even anything that could be in the box.
Okay, this has gone on
long enough.
Okay.
It's a ring that
turns you invisible
and carries with it
the power of evil.
I've seen fucking movies,
you guys! I've seen movies!
Wait, why are you alive?
What?
Why are you alive?
We're in the future.
Yeah, you know what?
He's right.
'Cause if we went back
in time, you'd be alive.
But we went 10 years
in the fuckin' future.
You should be dead.
Yeah, what the fuck?
What you should be
asking yourselves is,
- "when the fuck?"
-
Goddamn it!
- This fucking guy again!
- Why do you do that?
Lou: He's not going
to tell us anything.
Hey, why don't you make like
a fuck off and get out of here?
Wait. So all we have
to do is go back
and Lou's gonna
be okay, right?
It's not that simple, really.
The hot tub doesn't take you
where you want to go.
It takes you
where you need to go.
Come on!
There are certain calculations
and innovations
and salutations that haven't
even come to pass yet.
What the hell does that mean?
What it means is,
at the present,
your tub here is just a tub.
Wait, are you saying that time
travel is not even possible?
Right on, Liz.
Give the pretty lady a flower.
- Damn it.
- Lizzie.
That's bullshit, okay?
We got a whole vault
of nitro right here.
Where'd it go?
Where did it go?
What did you do with my nitro?
How can I take
what doesn't exist yet?
It exists in the past. How can
it not exist in the future?
The past, the future.
All very cute.
But who's to say the past
isn't anything more
than the future
of this present?
So nitro is from the future?
Like
- Yeah.
- Oh! Oh, my God.
You think everything
is like
'Cause everything
is like
Arnold's hand gets chopped off
in the past,
somebody finds it, reverse
engineers that shit. Boom!
Terminators running all
around this motherfucker.
That's how we got nitro?
I don't know.
I never saw
Oh, fuck this guy
and his riddles!
-
-
Thanks for holding him
down for me!
"Hold him down"?
So you can beat to death
the mystical time baron
that holds the keys
to our very existence?
That's your fucking plan here?
Shut up.
Tighten your shit up. Lou.
We needed him.
Amateur hour.
This thing is awesome.
I probably invented it.
"Lou sux
"Cox n Dix." Flip it.
Okay.
Try to stay with me.
This is going
to get complicated.
This is time.
-
- And you're dead.
So Lou is killed
in our present,
which means that here,
in the future,
he should still be dead.
Well, clearly,
he's not fuckin' dead,
'cause he's sittin' here,
still bothering me.
So what that tells me is
we're in a completely
different future
on a completely
different timeline.
Jacob, I'm the sarlacc.
-
- Jacob: Okay.
Anyway, the repairman said that
the past is actually the future
of the present we're in
right now.
So I think what that means is
the killer is from the future.
So clearly,
someone from 2025 will go back in time and shoot Lou.
Wow!
How about
a fucking spoiler alert?
"Hey, Lou, you want
to go see Looper?"
"Nah, I got a thing
I gotta do."
It's in my queue! That counts.
It's the first Bruce Willis
movie we missed.
- Is Bruce in that?
- Jacob: Okay.
Plainly, just by virtue of
Lou being here alive in 2025
when we know that
he died in 2015,
we're here to stop
his future murder.
- Which happens in the past.
- Exactly.
I get this shit.
I'm bored by this shit.
Let's go check out the future
strip club situation.
High five.
Did you just say "High Five"
instead of high-fiving?
- High five.
- High five.
That's the laziest thing
I've ever heard.
High five.
You don't have
the energy for this?
No, no. You guys,
we can't just fuck around.
We got to find your murderer.
Or we don't have
to do any of that
and we go check out
a strip club.
Oh!
- You flickered.
- Ah, you're flickering.
I flickered...
Why am I flickering?
By threatening
your own existence.
Have you listened to anything
I've been saying?
I have not listened
to any of it.
God, okay, fine! Fine.
We'll solve my stupid murder,
which hasn't happened yet.
Or we can just go
to a strip club.
Oh...
All right, fine!
The fucking murder thing.
Huh. Nothing's really changed.
You'd figure after 10 years,
something would be different, right?
That's some sexy-ass
future shit, right there.
Do you or someone you love
have a problem with Heroin?
- Yes. Yeah. Uh-huh.
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
Al Michaels' revenge?
Or Cocaine?
First order of business,
we get ourselves some Al Michaels' revenge, right?
We can help put the "U"
back in "Re-you-venate."
We're still demonizing addiction, huh?
Like it's some kind of sickness?
- I can't wait for you to hit rock bottom.
-  Yeah.
Who in the future
would want to kill you, Lou?
I don't know.
The only person who's ever had any
motivation to kill me has been me.
I treat everyone with the
utmost respect and kindness.
Lou, you tried to push me
down the stairs last week.
- As a joke!
-
Oh, my God, it's you.
Jacob is the murderer.
I'm not the murderer. Come on.
Oh, really?
Because you seem to have stepped right into my life.
You always wanted to be
the one fucking that tiger!
Lou, if I was going
to fuckin' kill you,
I wouldn't use a gun, okay?
I would spike
your mid-morning cocktail
with a tasteless,
but potent sedative.
And, while you slept,
I would wait the 9 hours
for it to flush out of your
system, so there's no trace.
And I would take you out
into the Gulf
and feed you to a tiger shark.
Damn, that's cold.
But I wouldn't use a gun.
I'll be making my own mid-morning
cocktail from now on, thank you.
Man, I wish Adam was here.
He'd know what to do.
You just described
my whole entire life.
We need Adam
and he's not here.
Where the hell is he?
Holy shit.
When we were carrying you
after you got shot,
I saw his trench coat
beside the hot tub
time machine.
Adam murdered me.
Jacob:
Okay, so Adam shoots Lou,
then uses the hot tub
to escape somewhere in time.
Textbook.
Only in our fucked-up social
circle is that textbook.
Why would Adam
wanna shoot you?
I don't know. I've only been
the best of friends to him.
- You tried to fuck his wife.
- You tried to fuck his wife?
As a joke!
Come on, you guys get that.
No.
- You get it.
-
In lougle financial news,
no surprise here,
lougle finished trading up
Nice. Looks like
I turned the company around.
I'll turn you around.
Somebody's grumpy
'cause they got murdered.
Nick: Mmm-hmm.
Adam! Come on out!
It's your best friends
in the whole fucking world!
You sure
this is the right place?
Lougle search brought up
Adam's location and DNA.
He's really got to fix
his privacy settings.
If he's here, I'm gonna
kill him before he kills me.
Hi. Can I help you?
Oh, my God.
Jacob Dorchen and Nick Webber?
-
- Guilty.
Just tell me. Tell me,
am I on celebrity Subpoena?
And hello, sir. Who are you?
- Fuck it, wrong house.
- Stop.
Does Adam Yates live here?
I'm Adam Yates Stedmeyer.
Okay, so you're married
to my aunt,
which makes you my Uncle.
But that means that
you and I are first cousins.
Oh, my God, you guys.
This is aws.
Nick: He looks like
a preppie braveheart.
I found this photo
after my mother died.
Both: Great white buffalo.
Great white buffalo.
- Both: Great white buffalo.
- Great white buffalo.
Great white buffalo. Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
So this is him, right?
This is my dad?
So you never met him?
No, they broke up
before I was even born.
Oh.
But you guys can introduce us.
Yeah. See, the thing about
that is, it's complicated.
Do you guys ever feel like
everything happens
for a reason?
- Yes.
- No.
Call it destiny,
or predestiny.
I think it's "Predestination."
No, it's predestiny.
I read a book.
Uh, was that book
a dictionary?
No, it was a book
called predestiny.
Okay, I don't
really give a shit.
With predestiny, it dictates
that there is a force or
something holding the strings
and setting everything up
just so they can be
knocked down perfectly
into
place.
I can't! I can't do it!
I gotta go. Let's go.
- Jacob: Sorry.
- Sorry, bro, we gotta go.
Nice skirt, by the way.
- Thank you.
- Jill: I have the dress.
Wait, who said anything
about a dress?
I certainly didn't say
anything about the dress.
Oh.
I'm sorry. I didn't realize
that Adam had guests.
- Hey, babe.
- Hi.
Guys, meet Jill.
Jill, meet the guys.
We're getting married
this weekend.
Uh, me and Jill,
not me and you guys.
Oh, stop it. You're gonna make
milk come out of my nose.
- Milk? What milk?
- I had milk earlier.
Oh.
Are you Nick Webber?
Yes. Yes, I am.
Would you please do
the Webber Strut?
The Webber...
Come on, you know it.
He wants us to do it.
I think so.
Both: Everybody,
strut, strut, strut, strut.
- Stop that.
- Strut, strut, strut...
Wow, they're really good
at your dance.
Your poor man's macarena
that you are very famous for.
they're, like,
picking dicks out of a tree.
It looks like dick-picking.
And for the record,
I still like your music.
I mean, I know you've fallen
on hard times.
Hard times?
You're so poor now,
but I really like you still.
What do you mean, poor?
- Oh, my God, that's the one.
- That's the one?
- That is the one.
-
Honey, we found
our mini-cake bites.
- Phew!
- Guys!
We found our mini-cake bites.
What?
Oh, I didn't tell you.
- Jacob is my cousin.
- No.
- And Uncle Lou...
- Don't you ever call me that.
- ...is my Uncle.
- What?
And they came here in a, uh...
What was it?
Both: Hot Tub Time Machine.
That's right.
Oh, okay.
So I guess you came here in
a hot tub time machine, too.
Listen.
- They're looking for my dad.
- What?
- You have to go with them.
- Uh...
Would you guys mind?
It would be really,
really great
to have my father
at the wedding.
Fuck that. Fuck that.
No way in hell.
No way in hell.
You gotta let Adam go.
I mean, this is exactly the
sort of thing that he needs.
We've been together
for 10 years.
He hardly ever goes out.
He didn't even have
a bachelor party.
You're making me
seem a little stiff.
Right.
All right. Well, you have fun
and make good choices.
- You're my best choice.
- You're my best choice.
- No, you're my best choice.
- You're my bestest choice.
No, you're my best choice!
Both: You're my best choice!
You're... My... Best... Choice.
- The fuck?
- Yeah, seriously.
Guys, I'll be there
in one second.
Both:
You're... My... Best... Choice.
Uh, so you guys are my dad's
full-on bros, huh?
I always wondered
what my dad's full-on bros
would be like and now...
Now I totally know.
'Cause we're getting some
serious hang-time.
Hey.
You know what,
I feel like we are going to have an unforgettably...
Dude, where the fuck
are we going?
Oh. Well, my mom used
to live near here,
so I figured we'd go
by her old building
and see if we can find a clue.
Okay! Well, there's
a 50-50 chance I might
murder your dad,
so if you have a reunion
speech, keep it tight.
- Nick: Whoa!
- Oh, shit!
Wassup, man?
No, no, no, no, no.
There's no one
driving that car.
Yeah, it's a smart car.
- Yeah, I can see that.
- No, it's a smart car.
- It's self-driving.
- What?
That's awesome!
Now, see, this is that future
shit I'm talking about.
How much that set you back?
You guys are hilarious.
I don't own it.
I mean, no one does.
You need a car, one shows up.
Really?
You're a wonderful car
and I appreciate you.
Come on.
So, this car
runs on feelings.
Yeah, I guess a six-year-old
would say that.
- Oh?
- Nick: Burn.
Really?
Would a six-year-old say that?
- What the fuck was that?
- Revved up on you.
- Did he just rev up on me?
- He sure did.
Hey! What's up?
You got a problem with me?
You know what?
I'll give you the first punch, huh? Go ahead.
Go ahead! Hit me!
Come on!
You're not a good car!
You're not smart!
You're just a car!
Okay. I don't think
it actually works that way.
Like, you can't
hurt its feelings.
You're a wonderful car
and I appreciate you.
Well, guess what?
You can hurt my feelings,
okay?
- What?
- I'm walking.
- Is he always like this?
- Pretty much.
Does he have, like,
emotional problems?
He's got a real serious
drug problem.
He got shot last night.
- He's got that runt ball.
- His son hates him.
That's fair to say, right?
Yeah, yeah. He's a monster.
I'd like to help him.
Oh, hey, I'm sure you're sick
of this, but,
will you sign my dick pad?
Jacob: Oh, you put your dick
in there!
Adam: It's a genius invention.
I know, okay? I know.
You put your whole mouth inside
your son's jerk-off machine.
What does your son's penis
taste like?
Goddamn you.
Was it delicious?
Oh, hey, a friend of mine's
some sort a big shot
over at lougle. Brad syed?
He's coming to my wedding.
- Brad?
- Hey.
You guys should absolutely
come to my wedding.
Jacob: Oh, man, I wish we
could, but we're doing, uh...
Motherfucker!
Gary Winkle.
Fuck him in the face.
Right in the fucking face.
It's not about money,
it's about making money.
- Oh! Look who it...
-
- Ah!
- How are you rich, huh?
How the fuck are you rich?
- Oh, Lou...
- You killed me!
I'm going to kill you before
you can kill me again!
Okay. Whoa, whoa, whoa...
That's hilarious. Why would I kill you?
I love you, man.
What?
Okay, okay, okay.
All right. I'm fine.
You not buying that land was the
best thing that ever happened to me.
Because when Hurricane Beth
came through
and destroyed half
the Waterfront...
It turned this worthless piece
of dirt into a gold mine.
What?
So you didn't murder me?
What are you talking about?
I love you, man.
So, are you boys coming up
or what?
It's not a party unless
it's a Gary Winkle party.
At Gary Winkle's
the wink.
- What are you doing?
- It's a double wink.
Ah, technically,
that's more of a blink.
- That's a blink.
- You can't wink, can you?
Of course I can wink.
Prove it.
Yeah.
Let me do this. Hold on.
Let me hold this open.
I'll hold this open.
Now do it.
Both: See?
Can we go
to the fuckin' party now?
Welcome to the wink!
Hey, jugglers, give my boys
anything they want...
From that shelf down.
- Lou, what are we doing here?
- You know.
Winkle is not the killer.
We gotta go.
I don't care, 'cause there's
cocaine right there.
Didn't you see the cocaine?
Look, look, look.
I see the cocaine. So what?
Well, I'm going to do that.
So first... and then...
Look, I'm not flickering.
Am I flickering?
You cannot say
that I'm flickering.
We're on a mission
to save your life.
You think I don't want to roll
my dick around some cocaine,
- and get titty-slapped?
- Okay.
Pop some bottles?
Do some crazy future shit?
I'm trying to keep you
from flickering.
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Good talk.
Thank you. And popping
bottles, that's old school.
You bringing that back?
- Yeah.
-
I like that. I like you.
Uh-oh.
What are these? I don't care.
Oh. So, Nick, listen,
I was so sorry
to hear about
you and Courtney.
- What do you mean?
- Ah.
Gotcha.
Forget I even brought it up.
No, no, no, really,
what do you mean?
I hear you
loud and clear, man.
I don't think
you hear me at all.
Hey, Sophie!
There you are.
I have a surprise for you.
Oh. Uh...
Sophie has a surprise for me.
Bye, dude!
I'll take a room-temperature
almond milk, please.
No, actually, I'll get
a Tangerine Margarita.
I'll just take an Apricot
sliced into fours. And a Kiwi.
Do you have Kiwi?
I'll take a Kiwi, sliced up.
A banana thrown in there.
You know what?
Dealer's choice.
Just a fruit salad.
Should we go
somewhere more private?
Jacob Dorchen wants privacy.
That's so 2018.
Right, right.
No. Get that out of here.
I mean, I wouldn't mind
a little something.
Remember, we agreed?
Look at your dad.
You're not going down that road anymore.
Oh, God, I'm so good at that!
Yes!
It's Satan.
Like, I'll finger your dog,
I don't care.
As a joke! As a joke!
I have some advice for you.
If you don't want to be
considered a sex offender,
don't take a shit in a sandbox
that happens to be
in a playground.
Okay? Don't do it.
'Cause guess what?
You have two things, a record
and a fucking nickname.
I know it's a potentially
risky move... wedding sorbet!
As a palate cleanser,
of course.
I mean, I'm not insane.
Oh, my God! Fuckin' a!
You're Nick Webber, man!
Let's take a picture!
I can't believe it's you, man.
I'm gonna send this
to everyone.
I'm gonna get, like,
a billion views!
I remember when I first heard
that stupid song. I was like,
"man, that song is so dumb."
Do the Strut.
- Do the Strut.
- No, I'm good.
You won't do the fucking song?
You want to see the strut?
Whoa, whoa, whoa...
Dj:  Hey, yo!
Check this out!
Nick Webber's in the house,
so get ready for the original
- Webber Strut!
-
Before that, let's back it up.
Six years ago,
see where it all began.
I made a lot of mistakes.
I've taken advantage.
And now I'm ready
to be original.
This is dedicated to those
who never got to be,
Strut to the time
of the clock
It's midnight
everybody strut right now
Nick Webber
Nick Webber
you don't know
but you think you know
Nick Webber
Nick Webber
Everybody do the
strut, strut, strut
Everybody do the
strut, strut, strut
Everybody do the
strut, strut, strut
Everybody do the
strut, strut, strut
Oh!
Oh, this...
this room is so much better than the other room.
What?
No!
Look at him go.
Chip off the old block.
Okay, be nice. Be nice. Be nice.
Be nice. Be nice. Be nice. Be nice!
Hmm. Son!
Hey! What a coincidence.
Wondered where you ran off to,
but here you are.
Who let you in here?
Would you go find your murderer?
Think your old man can get in
on a little of this action, or...
- This is... This is a private party.
- This one's mine.
- Jacob: What?
- Yes! See? Ha! Still got it.
What are the...
What are the house rules here?
I just want to know what to do.
Don't want to break any rules,
get chucked out right away,
you know? That'd be fucked up.
Touch me, you filthy vagrant.
Jacob:  Oh, wait, wait,
what was that?
Nothing. What was that?
It wasn't anything.
- You just flickered.
- Flickered? No, I didn't.
- How did you do that?
- He's threatening his own existence.
Lou, you can't be here 'cause
you're jeopardizing your future.
You mind your own
fucking beeswax, huh.
Whatever. I'm over this.
No... no!
No! No!
Adam: Long story short,
the caterer did talk us
into the chateaubriand,
which, you know, I'll admit,
is a sexy side of beef.
Sounds like it.
And I think you know
where I'm going with this.
- You thought wrong.
- Horseradish station.
That's right. We're gonna have
the white and the reds,
separate service,
different intensity.
It's gonna be great...
Wait a second. Nick?
You should play our wedding.
People would love to see
the strut in person.
I'm sure they would.
Hey, what do you guys
want from the party tray?
Me? Oh, uh...
I don't know.
I'm getting married tomorrow,
so I'm really trying
to take it easy.
Yeah, you're getting married
for the rest of your life,
so why have any fun
tonight at all?
- Oh!
- Yeah.
- Uncle Lou is right.
- Don't call me that.
Give me the craziest thing
you got.
Someone sounds like he wants
the electric ladybug.
Ooh, the electric...
- What, uh... I'm sorry, what exactly is that?
-
Don't take it off
for 24 hours.
Why can't I take it off
for 24 hours?
Yeah. What's so funny?
Relax. Relax.
It's just like baby aspirin.
Except more of a super-high
intensity psychotropic drug trip.
I promise you,
you're not gonna like this.
Bye-bye.
Horseradish.
-
- Hello.
Oh!
Shit.
Not in the dumpster.
I owe you 50 bucks.
Adam: Hey, lick my pussy.
Just kidding, guys.
I'm up here. What's up?
Jacob: What are you doing
up there?
Why are you down there,
stupid fuck?
You guys, last night,
my eyes
opened.
- Okay.
- I'm telling you, you guys,
you got to get up here.
I mean,
the way the sun is just dancing off these leaves...
Mr. Webber.
Hi. I'm from
I'm here to take you to the show.
Show?
-
- Yeah.
Nick: How about that?
Nick Webber has a show
in 2025. Still got it!
Right, but, I mean,
we can't go
because we have
to solve his murder.
Come on! Look.
Hey, not flickering.
Maybe it's a lead.
It's a fun lead.
Jacob: Until somebody goes
back in time and kills you.
I can't miss my gig.
Okay,
is my favorite show.
Wait, how did you find us?
I just go where
the cars take me.
Adam: Okay, I'm coming down.
You think I can make
that dumpster, guys?
- No.
- No.
Yeah, I think
I can probably make it.
Yes, yes, yes, yes! Come on!
Yeah, I think so, too, Lou.
Thanks.
- Adam, stay right there.
- Stop. Adam!
- Come on!
- Nick: Baby Adam!
-  You can!
- Stop, Lou!
Here I go. I'm gonna jump.
- Whoo!
- Lou: Holy fuck...
Got you!
Jacob:
That was fucking awesome!
- Oh, my God!
- How did you even do that?
I'm strong as fuck.
Male announcer: Get ready
for Mischief, Mayhem,
plenty of truths
and more than one dare!
This is
celebrity Choozy Doozy!
Thank you very much
for that, gill!
Welcome to our show!
We got a very, very exciting
show planned for you tonight.
Please help me welcome back to
the stage, musical sensation,
- Nick Webber!
-
Hello?
Hey, honey,
guess where I am. Just guess.
Okay, shut up.
I'm at
I tried to call you, like,
a hundred times.
What was with that crazy
phone call last night?
You don't remember calling me
and telling me that
you were a God?
No. Does that sound like me?
Listen, I had the most
amazing night.
I did everything.
I punched a man in the face.
Just walked up to him.
Just punched him with my fist.
I did eskimo kisses
with this beautiful woman.
What are you talking about?
that everything that
you've experienced and said
up to this point
is just a fraud?
Excuse me?
No. Okay,
"Fraud" is too strong a word.
It's more like
a lie.
"Lie" is actually...
It's not right, either.
It's kind of
a hard concept to...
Okay, bye, honey.
All right, that went well.
That went really well.
Our studio audience
will have the opportunity
to challenge you
to specific tasks.
The best idea shall prevail.
Because this is...
All:
What is that, exactly?
Let me hear some ideas
from the audience.
Come on!
We want some new ideas!
Woman:
Eat a bunch of waffles!
Eat a bunch of waffles.
Very, very nice choice.
Man 1: Juggle Knives!
Ooh! Very scary!
He could lose an arm!
That happened last week.
Man 2: Swallow a watch!
Can you swallow a watch, Nick?
I hope not.
Fuck a dude!
- Whoa!
-
Yeah!
Say some more stuff!
Say something else!
Now, remember, folks, when you
see something you like,
you make your selection,
- and it'll show up here on the board.
-
Uh, I don't want
to fuck a dude.
Ah, you're adorable.
This is the best day
of my life.
What the fuck's wrong
with everybody?
Waffles, waffles.
It's a neck-and-neck with...
Oh! Oh, well...
Look at that.
Oh, hell, no!
Brett: You just got
very lucky, my friend,
because you were almost about to
have to eat a whole bunch of waffles!
I'm willing to do that.
I'm willing...
I'll eat the waffles.
Okay, now...
Who had the idea of this man
fornicating with a gentleman?
Over here! This guy!
What's your name, sir?
Lou Dorchen.
Well, Lou, as you know,
with
All: You choose it,
you dooze it!
You choose it, you dooze it.
I'm sorry. I dooze what now?
Oh, shit!
- Come on up here, Lou!
- Lou: This is crazy!
Stop smiling!
And, we're back with
the
challenge round.
We have Nick Webber along
with his pal, Lou Dorchen!
What exactly is this?
It's the number one show
on TV.
Okay, load 'em up!
What the fuck?
I don't think this is real.
Yeah. It's like
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.
Just like
except, you know,
we're supposed to fuck.
Yeah, well,
that's not going to happen.
Bring me the thing!
Well...
I'm glad
we're on the same page.
What's going on? Lou!
Oh...
-
-
Motherfucker!
This is getting a little dark.
Dark? What do you mean?
Okay, if this is the most
popular show,
give me some
of the other shows?
Yeah, of course.
There's
there's daddy,
where are you going?
There's, um,
- Yeah,
It just shows big buildings
falling down, and...
Kids, like, trapped in the basement,
and the building falls,
and they're like,
"Ma, get me out of here."
And it shows them how
to get out in an emergency,
but also tells them
when to give up.
Ah!
Bing bong! What's the delay?
Hey.
Hey. There's something
trying to kill us here.
That's 10,000 volts of electricity
coursing through the suits
that you're wearing
back here in the studio!
Every week,
it's the same goddamn thing.
It's guy on guy, girl on girl.
Sometimes it's even
guy on girl.
What is the big deal with the two
of you boys sleeping together?
You're acting like it's 2010,
for Christ's sakes.
Now we got a show to do, boys!
So start fucking!
Dude, is there, like, a stage manager?
They're going to kill these guys.
Hey, I'm sorry.
Look, if you're going to sit next to me,
I need to know right now.
Do you have a problem with this show?
Well, yeah,
clearly I have a problem with the show.
- I mean, look, this is grotesque.
- Jacob, this is a great show.
This is the number one show in the nation.
This is a show that families enjoy, okay?
- This is a family show?
- Absolutely.
- Like it's on at, like, 8:00?
- It's on at 7:00 on Sunday nights
against
and it always wins.
Classic Lou.
Okay.
Okay.
I'm sorry, Lou.
I know you are, buddy! I know!
I know. I love you, man!
Don't say that!
I don't wanna have
an emotional connection
to this moment!
What... oh, God forbid
a couple of friends
can't express their brotherly love for each other!
I love you.
I told you to
stop saying that!
Lou: I'm so sorry!
So there are
no more sex taboos?
Well, I guess bestiality,
but only from a community property perspective.
What do you...
What do you mean?
What, you don't remember
Guy tries to divorce a Llama,
and the land is in dispute
because the llama
needs to graze?
But people still
eat animals, right?
Oh, yeah, absolutely.
And animals eat people. It's all the same.
You got a tuft of hair
coming out your crack.
Don't fuckin' worry
about it, okay?
I'll get your
grooming tips later.
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.
Okay. I love you.
All right! Put it in slow!
Really slow!
One...
Two...
- Take that dick.
- What the fuck?
Come on!
It's just something I say.
"Take that dick"?
Oh, wait, hold on!
Stop, stop, stop!
Oh!
Looks like somebody
chose a lifeline!
Me! Me! I did it! I chose it!
Who will the lucky winner be?
What happens?
Do we get waffles?
- What happened?
- It's a lifeline,
so the chooser picks
a new doozer.
You gotta choose someone,
Lou.
Nick: Choose waffles.
Oh.
Okay, I get it. I get it.
All right. All right. Uh...
Yeah, I know just the guy.
He loves this show.
Oh!
Oh, no, no, no. I'm...
I'm actually getting married
tonight, so I can't.
It's actually
an issue of fidelity.
I cannot do this.
You're a monster, Lou.
What's up?
Nick: Get ready,
'cause here it comes.
Here what comes?
Oh, wow!
That was good TV.
You know what, Adam,
I thought about it.
You can call me Uncle Lou now.
Holy shit! Did you see that?
You're a fucking lunatic!
- Was that the same car?
- Couldn't be.
That car tried to run me down on purpose.
Did you see that?
What if that car's
my murderer?
You were shot in the dick
in the past, remember?
Oh, like that would be
the craziest fucking thing
that's ever happened to us.
That car's an asshole.
That car's not an asshole.
You're an asshole.
Whoa. Where'd that come from?
Everything is all about Lou.
No regard for anybody else.
I'm pretty sure that's never
been the case at all, ever.
Because of you,
Adam just got raped.
Are we calling it a rape?
Whoa! Nobody got raped.
It felt like kind
of a gray area.
You're a fucking virus, Lou.
You find a vulnerable host,
and you attach yourself
and you just
- fuck 'em all up.
- Lou:  Okay.
Okay. Someone needs
to find a chill-out tent.
Let's get you a comfy couch
and a video game.
Where does it say in the Shitty Parents'
Handbook to treat your son like shit?
Well, if it's the
wouldn't it
be, like, the theme
of the whole book?
No, he's...
He's right. Wait.
No, no, no, no.
It's a step by step guide for how to be a shitty parent.
- Exactly.
Okay. You're right.
I apologize. I apologize.
- You were totally wrong.
- No, why would someone write that book?
Actually, Nick's idea about re-titling
it
is a solid idea,
if you want to use the metaphor again.
- Lou: It's an impulse buy.
- All right, you know what? Forget it.
You're right. That's fair.
It was a misleading title. But the point is...
Fuck you!
If they're not gonna say it,
I will.
I am so tired of solving
your problems.
You wanna stop your murder,
figure it out yourself. I'm going to Winkle's.
- Jacob, what the fuck?
- Youngblood!
No. You know why?
'Cause as long as we're here,
I'm Jacob fucking Dorchen!
And that means something.
Jacob, come on!
Youngblood,
we got to figure this out.
Lou: You're the only one
keeping track of important stuff!
I mean...
You know what?
Fuck it. Fuck it.
Who cares? Who needs him?
I don't need him.
Hey, I'm getting
married today, guys.
What do you say
we kick this day in the pants
and get over there early
for some Bloody Mary-Tinis?
I'm sorry. Can I just
get rid of this thing?
No! She said not
to take it off for 24 hours.
- Or what?
- I don't know.
Yeah, exactly. If I had
a dime for every time
I did something a cocktail waitress told me not to do,
I'd be rich. Look.
Oh!
Oh, my God, the cocktail
waitress was wrong.
Sorry, my mistake.
I should listen to you more often, Lou.
- All right.
-
You just learned
a valuable life lesson.
I did.
Guys?
Come on.
Mm...
Ew, God. So...
- 911, right?
- Yeah.
Lou: Ugh.
Fucking disgusting, dude!
Okay, you're sick.
You made your point.
Come on, Lou,
you know he can't help it.
You okay, buddy?
Okay, this is becoming
a bit of a hygiene issue.
All right, let's see what
we have here. Okay, yeah.
Kel.
Come on, really?
Divorced? What the fuck
are you talking about?
Kelly, we're soulmates.
Not anymore.
- Mommy?
- No, I'm not your mommy.
- Homie?
- Yeah, I'm your homie.
Was it... was it something
you did? If so, I don't care.
I don't care. I forgive you.
- Put this in his mouth.
-
If you don't communicate
with me, I can't fix this!
You can't fix anything.
Hey, bite down on this.
Good. Okay.
- What's going on?
- Here we go.
Okay.
Oh, that's actually not bad.
You know,
it's, like, kind of sweet.
What's happening to him?
Oh, this is totally normal.
The Nanobots are attacking
the Narcotics.
How long has he been
on heroin?
It was a Ladybug.
- Wait, the sticker?
- Yeah, on the neck.
Yeah. We normally
give Tylenol for that.
- I just pumped him full of...
- Narcotic-Seeking Nanobots?
- Yeah.
- Whoops.
You're a great listener.
I should have married you.
Lou: Look, Kel,
I'm sorry, okay?
I'm sorry.
Can we just move on?
I did move on, Lou.
I got clean.
You're the one who doesn't
have a rock bottom.
I just pray that
there's still hope for Jacob.
Gary: This ain't a circus!
Quick juggling
and make some fucking drinks!
Hey! Jake the snake!
Hey, is it still
day out there?
Who gives a shit?
What can I get you?
I'll take everything!
You sure about that?
'Cause, remember what
happened last time?
Everything.
Okay.
All right! Set Mr. Dorchen up
with the usual...
And, you know, call security.
Kelly: The nanobots
can't find any drugs,
so they're traveling to
the lowest part of his body,
where they'll harden
and expand.
- His feet?
- In his testicles.
Well, that hardly seems like
the lowest part of his body.
- Shit!
- What's happening?
Okay. It's now or never.
Adam:
What are you doing?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
-
What is that?
What you gonna
do with that?
Stick him! Stick him!
Oh, shit!
That's a lot of juice!
Okay! Enough!
Now what's gonna happen,
I'm going to pull this out,
and there might
be some leakage, okay?
Don't pull it out.
Don't pull it out.
- I like it where it is.
- Kelly: One, two, three...
Ha! Ah!
- Lou: Oh, wow! Okay.
- Fuck your ball juice!
Oh, I walked right
into that one. Literally.
Oh, I don't know about you guys,
but I feel way better.
There's definitely
semen in that.
There's definitely
fucking semen in that.
Did you taste the robots?
They're gritty.
Oh, fucking bottle service.
-
- Woman: Hey!
Every fucking weekend.
Hey, baby.
You're a fuck-up, Jacob.
Just like your loser dad.
I'm not anything
like my fucking dad!
No...
Oh, no, wait, wait, wait.
Wait.
Wait.
I know how this looks.
No. You don't.
You see my son?
Do you know my son?
Jacob!
Has anybody seen
a Grown-Up garbage pail kid?
There's Winkle.
Gary: I pay you girls
to like me. Hey, smile!
Hey!
Uh-oh! Electric Ladybug, huh?
- Fuck you, dude!
- Yeah.
Hey, how you doing?
I'm doing fucking shitty,
Gary.
Still haven't found my killer,
and there's a car trying to run me down.
I had a passat follow me around
for three weeks one time.
Had to buy it rims
to make it go away.
You know what
I'm talking about, huh?
Where's Jacob?
Oh, I had to throw him out,
like I always do.
You know what I mean?
He said something about going
to see his family therapist,
whoever the fuck that is.
I know where he is.
I'm not that strong.
Hey, son.
It's daddy.
It's a nice... nice place.
Yeah, yeah.
I mean, like,
as far as rooms go,
this is one of the biggest.
A great room is a great room.
I could see myself
chilling here.
Right. Throwing some football.
Having a football match right
in the middle of the floor.
Football, basketball,
you know, just all the sports.
I'm so comfortable
and relaxed right now.
Me, too.
- Hey, Adam...
- Yeah.
...about what happened
at
No, it was...
You know, it was virtual.
Yeah. Virtual.
So it was just like...
It's in the ether.
- It does not exist.
- Who cares?
That shit happened.
Yeah, we should get
that show cancelled.
Or at least arrest someone.
I could've ate
some goddamn waffles.
It's like you shoved
a fucking buick up my butt.
I got a buick dick.
You do.
Shit got bad, Lou.
I mean, bad like the part
of
after Mark Wahlberg jerks off
in the pickup truck.
I mean, here we are,
with the greatest power
the universe has to offer
at our fingertips
and we're just
a bunch of fuck-ups.
Jacob, I know what
you're going through.
Yeah, I know that you do.
You're the biggest fuck-up
I know.
Look.
You know, all dorchen men end up
on a roof at some point in their lives.
We party till we want to kill
ourselves. My dad did it.
And your son
will do it after you.
Even grandpappy dorchen?
Jumped off a roof, survived,
died of syphilis.
Jacob, how can we expect
to find happiness
anywhere in time if we're just
not happy people?
We do the best that we can.
Here comes the hug monster.
All right. Come on. Let's go
do some more dumb shit.
- Whoa!
- I got you!
- Lou, don't drop me!
- I got you!
Don't drop me!
I'm not gonna let you fall,
I promise.
- I trust you.
- Okay.
Oh, fuck, I'm gonna drop you!
Don't drop me! Don't drop me!
I'm dropping you!
You fell!
Fuck you!
No!
Female automated voice:
Oh, look at that. Force field.
Oh, this is a great call.
I must have invented that.
Seriously. Thank you, dad.
My pleasure, son.
- Is it fun?
- Yeah, it's kind of fun.
You know what?
I'm coming down, too! Yay!
Lou: Guys, guys, guys,
come on!
We got a murder
to solve here, huh?
Let's think. It's not Winkle.
It's obviously not Jacob.
- Right?
- Hey.
- No? Right
- come on. Come on.
All right. Okay.
Some curious news out
of the tech sector today.
A new synthetic element
has been developed.
is tentatively being
called nitrotrinadium.
That's it.
- Brad never liked me.
- No?
And Brad's going
to Adam's wedding.
Oh, I keep forgetting
you guys know Brad.
It's gonna be fun, my wedding.
I'm looking forward to it.
Oh, fuck! My wedding!
Jill's going to kill me.
I have to go change.
Oh, God. I can't believe that
son of a bitch stole my idea.
Let's split up and find Brad
on three. One, two, three.
All: Split up and find Brad before
he goes back in time and kills Lou!
- Wow! We are so locked in.
- Same page.
- We are so locked in.
- Same page.
- That's awesome.
- Nick: Right.
It's normal for men to blow off some
steam before their wedding, right?
Adam? What'd he do, have
a light lunch and a spa day?
He did drugs and had sex with a
man he barely knows on national TV.
That doesn't sound like Adam.
Honey, like you said,
he's just blowing off steam.
Why didn't I blow off steam?
I have steam to blow off.
All I did
was get my hair done!
- It looks beautiful.
- Oh, shut up, you dumb slut.
You blew half of Pittsburgh
before your bachelorette party.
Get me some champagne.
I don't know
what's taking Jill.
You think she saw
Does she watch it?
- It's her favorite show.
- Then she probably saw it.
Fuck!
Sorry.
This isn't good.
She's never late. Ever.
Do you think
she and I are gonna be okay?
I don't know, man.
I'm not the guy to ask about marriage.
- Wait, are you married?
- Yeah. Well...
I don't know.
I hope so.
Okay. Well, I have to find Jill.
Will you cover for me?
No, we gotta find Brad.
Fuck a dude. Fuck two dudes.
"I'm Adam.
I get plowed by dudes on TV."
Oh.
Eeny, meeny, miney, drunk.
Choozy Doozey.
Oh, so sorry. Wrong room.
Ohh, shit.
Anybody know a Brad Syed?
Report...
Hey, Nick Webber.
Do the dance.
Yeah, do the dance.
You want me to do
the fucking dance?
All: Yeah!
This is who I've become,
isn't it?
The man who will
apparently do anything
to keep
his shitty career going.
Meanwhile,
when's the last time
I shared a romantic dinner
with my wife?
Or just did anything,
just the two of us?
I'll bet there's a lot
of people here tonight
who have been
taken for granted.
When's the last time
your man gave you flowers,
Fuck you, dude.
Right?
On this special occasion,
be thankful
for the one you're with.
Now do the dance!
All: Yeah!
Do it! Do it!
-
-
- Hey, Brad.
- Hey, Jacob...
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa...
Give me the Nitrotrinadium,
Brad!
Give me the fuckin' Nitro!
- Okay, okay.
- Slowly.
Slowly.
Be very careful,
it's my only one.
I only trust you with it.
You thought you had it all
figured out, didn't ya?
Just gonna go back in time
and kill my dad.
- Kill your dad?
- Yeah.
I know your plan, Brad.
Okay, sure,
I thought about it.
A lot. When I worked for him.
I knew it.
But why would I wanna kill
the man partly responsible
for the greatest scientific
achievement of all time?
There was no such thing
as Nitrotrinadium
when your dad gave me the idea
for it 10 years ago.
...for time travel!
Brad: He had a history
of pulling great ideas
- Boom!
Brad: ...And goddamn it,
he did it again.
I'm gonna be in the lab,
trying to save this company.
I dedicated my life's work to making
Lou dorchen's vision a reality.
Wait. So you are the inventor
of time travel.
Right? It's fucking awesome.
So you weren't gonna
go back to 2015
and shoot him in the dick.
Shoot him?
If I was going to kill your dad,
it wouldn't be with a gun.
What I would do
is spike his morning cocktail
with a potent sedative
before dragging his body
to the Gulf and...
Both: ...Feeding it
to a shark.
- Yeah.
- It's the perfect plan.
Lou: Are you having
as fantastic a time as I am?
Jill: Shut up!
This isn't making love!
This is a "fuck you"
to my fiance!
Lou: Right, right,
right, right. Okay.
Jill: Fuck me, Uncle Lou!
Lou: Whoa! Whoa! Hold on!
I feel like that is an
important distinction to make.
Fuck me,
Uncle Lou by marriage!
I can't believe I'm fucking Adam's
father's future daughter-in-law!
Jill:
I can't believe I'm fucking
Adam's father's
sister's husband!
Adam! Have you seen Lou?
That jacuzzi time machine
thing, is that real?
- It's a hot tub.
- Whatever!
Listen, Adam, I'm sorry,
I gotta be a stickler on this.
Jacuzzi is a brand name,
and...
Shut up! How does it work?
- How does it work?
- This!
Brad: It's the only nitrotrinadium in the whole world!
Ten fucking years!
It was a bitch to make, dude!
I know, Brad. I didn't
mean to fuckin' lose it.
He got the jump on me.
But he's so much
smaller than you.
He had, like,
super-human strength,
like that fucking baby
in
You mean baby superman?
That baby was Superman.
Yeah, I mean...
That baby was Superman, Jacob!
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.
- Any luck?
-
- Yeah.
- You found him?
Oh, shit! No. Brad. No, you?
Nah.
Dude.
Ten years of my life.
Handle it.
Instead of linear,
think of space-time as being fluid...
- Hey.
- Hey, Lou.
Both: America!
Brad was helping.
He's not the murderer.
Oh. Hmm.
- Oops.
- Then what happened?
Adam took the nitro.
He's going back to 2015 to kill you.
Adam Junior's the murderer?
Why would he do that?
Um, hmm...
I think... uh...
You guys are gonna think
this is hilarious. I may have,
uh, fucked his wife.
A tiny bit! A tiny bit.
You know, in her vagina,
or whatever.
Fuck, Lou!
So you just created
your own killer.
- Oh, so I'm the bad guy now!
- Yes!
Yes.
Come on!
Jacob: Fuck!
Lou: Shit.
Baby Adam got away.
Oh, shit. Shit.
Look, look, look!
Come on, come on, come on...
No, no, no, no, no!
This has got to end now.
-
- Nick and Jacob: Lou...
- Lou, what are you doing?
- Lou, get out of the road.
- Nick and Jacob: Lou!
- I know what I'm doing!
Get the fuck out
of the street!
You don't know what you're doing.
You're going to die!
Lou, would you come
the fuck on?
Let me do this! I got this!
I got this!
- Stop!
-
I'm sorry. Okay.
-
- Okay, okay, okay! I mean it.
I do. I mean it. I'm a dick.
Ask my friends.
- He's a dick.
- Big ol' dick.
Look, I get you. I do.
I know what it's like
to feel unappreciated,
like just a member
of the pack.
I just want you to know that
despite what I said before,
I do appreciate you.
And I'm appealing to your
sense of humanity right now.
There is a maniac
trying to kill me.
And I'm asking you to be the
bigger car and help me out.
I'm just a guy
looking at a car
and asking it to love me.
Listen, you can't
go with me, okay?
Scat!
-
-
Hey, listen. I'll be back,
okay? I promise I'll be back.
We'll go all the places that
we never got to go.
Okay? Just...
Wait for me. You, uh...
Stay blue.
Jacob: Oh, shit.
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
We're too late.
We just missed him.
I guess that's it.
We're stuck here.
That means in a minute,
Lou's going to
disappear.
No. That can't be right.
Right, Jacob?
I mean, you got...
You got a plan or something.
No. We just got to, um...
What are we gonna do?
Fuck, I don't know.
I don't know.
Aw, shit, Lou.
- I'll miss you, brother.
- I'll miss you, too.
Hey.
Before I forget, will you just
keep an eye on him?
He's got such
a big future ahead of him.
- Obviously.
- Yeah.
I got it.
Jacob, it's okay. Don't...
No, no, no.
Our nitro was missing
because it didn't exist yet.
But if Adam took
the nitro to the past,
then it exists here
in the future.
Holy shit!
Nick: There's still time.
- Jacob!
- Let's go!
Nick: We gotta go back to
the past to save the future.
What does this remind you of?
- Always
- Always  I know.
Let's go save Lou's life.
Both: High five.
High five.
This is my favorite part!
Ah, here we go! Here we go!
- I think we made it!
- Let's go!
- Let's go!
- Okay.
It's the party.
And there's still time!
He's gotta be around
here somewhere!
Buffer:
Worth 2.3 billion dollars,
introducing
- Hey, everybody.
- Adam: Lou!
Lou, I found him.
I'm going to shoot you
in the dick
so you can't fuck
anyone else's wife!
Technically,
you all aren't married yet,
- so she's not your wife.
- Yes, she is!
Jacob: Adam, I hate to be a stickler,
but you guys haven't met yet.
- It's 2015.
- Shut the fuck up!
- Mazel Tov!
- Congratulations!
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
It's probably pretty hard
to shoot a man, right?
Don't.
It's okay. It's okay. Watch.
I'm just gonna make it
easier on you. Look.
- Shotgun to the dick.
- His destiny.
I turned you into a murderer.
I've just ruined my own life.
I have so much fuckin' poison in
me that I've ruined yours, too.
Jacob was right.
I'm a virus.
This is your revenge to take.
Okay?
Please.
I've seen my future.
You saw it. I'm a disaster.
It's okay.
Just kill me and put us both
out of our misery?
Please.
I can't.
I can't do it.
Jesus Christ, do I have
to fucking do everything?
Lou...
No!
You okay?
You're fucking crazy, Lou.
I'm sorry,
I may have shit my pants.
That's all right.
It was a stressful situation.
It was really stressful.
I'm exhausted.
Both: Oh!
- I'm so sorry.
- I'm sorry.
- Jill?
- How did you know my...
Oh. My Nametag.
No, no,
it's because you're my...
I'm sorry. This is just...
This is weird.
Up until yesterday,
I thought I had a normal life.
I know what you mean. I...
Have you ever felt like
your entire life was a fraud?
I'm sorry. "Fraud" is
the wrong word. "Lie"?
I'm Adam.
- I'm...
- Jill. I know.
Lovely tuxedo you're wearing.
Thank you.
Well, it's for our...
Forgot what I was
going to say.
Well, that was exciting.
I guess it's not
a lougle party
until somebody gets shot at.
I don't want to go
to the Grammys.
No?
I don't wanna go
to your sister's either.
I just want to go somewhere,
just you and me.
Start making things right.
I like that. Okay.
And I want to get out
of this shirt.
I've been in it for, like,
three days,
and it's really loud.
- Come here.
- Hmm?
Put your arms up for a sec,
like that.
Is this a dance or something?
Something like that.
More of a Strut.
I'm coming in.
Okay.
- There it is. Yeah.
- Oh, okay.
- Oh, this is some stupid shit.
- You have no idea.
Kelly:
Did I just hear fireworks?
Because fireworks make me want
to puke, and you know that.
Hmm? Mmm...
Why are you more handsome?
I'm a bald person.
Hey.
What do you think about doing
a 12-step program with me?
You know, like,
go to an awesome rehab
with good food and a pool
and classy people.
What do you think?
- Okay.
- Yeah?
I fucking hate you, Lou.
I fucking hate you, Kelly.
Jacob: Sophie! Hey!
Where are you going?
Um, people are shooting
each other.
I'm getting out of here.
I've seen our future together
and I will be the first person
to admit that it is fucking insane.
The drugs,
the constant partying.
It's enough to make anybody ask,
"when is enough enough?"
What are you talking about?
Just stay with me here.
Just stay with me.
Did you change?
Yeah, in so many ways.
But, listen,
right in the middle
of that future
is this toxic power couple
named you and me.
And does it all end
in tragedy and tears
and a murder mystery?
Yes, of course it does.
But I don't care.
I just got one question,
Sophie.
Are you ready for the ride
of your fucking life?
What's that in your pocket?
My dick.
Oh, the other thing.
A billion fucking dollars.
Hey, I just met
my future wife in there.
Yeah, man. Hang out with us,
that kind of shit happens all the time.
Yeah.
A lot of highs and lows here.
- Yeah.
- When you think about it,
Lou had to fuck your wife
in the future,
so you could meet her
in the past.
- Well...
- Yeah. But, hey...
That's what uncles do, right?
Not really.
Jacob: Hey,
just think of it this way.
Since it happened
in the future,
it technically hasn't
happened at all.
It's Cyclical.
Adam: Yeah. And even though I didn't meet my dad,
I met some friends for life.
Nick: Oh, yeah? Who?
- Adam: Hey, Lou?
- Uncle Lou.
Uncle Lou.
No harm, no foul,
but did you ejaculate in her?
Hey. That doesn't matter.
I ejaculated inside of you.
Jacob: And that doesn't
matter either.
Because those are both just
hypothetical future scenarios.
No one ejaculated inside
of anything, really.
No one's ejaculated.
-  Yeah, I did.
- Lou: You know what?
I had this moment earlier.
I think it was when my nephew
from the future
had a shotgun
pointed at my dick
that I'd helped him
place there.
That was me.
But in that moment,
everything became clear to me.
We need to change
people's lives.
Make the world a better place.
All we have to do is...
-
- Ah!
Lou!
Man: Don't listen to
anything he says.
Jacob: Adam?
Nick: What the fuck? You shot Lou!
Dad?
What's going on?
- No time to explain. Follow me.
- But where?
Cincinnati.
Adam: No, no, dad, wait!
Why did my dad just kill Lou?
- He probably had an okay reason.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Wait! Don't go with Adam!
Patriot Lou.
Are those wooden teeth?
Nick: He looks like Cap'n Crunch fucked Paul Revere.
- His hair is breathtaking.
- He's beautiful.
- Don't listen to him.
- Why?
It's a long story.
Believe me, he did us all a favor.
This one was bad.
Okay.
But the bigger question is, how...
That's not the only me.
You think you're the only you?
There's a ton of yous
out there.
Look, you're gonna like
this me a lot better.
This me is great.
Take it from me.
Holy shit.
I mean,
you guys get it, right?
