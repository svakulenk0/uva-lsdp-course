Man's voice:
My whole life, it was obvious
l was gonna end up in this city.
l don't want to be arrogant here,
but l'm an incredibly attractive man.
l can't help it.
l don't try to be. l just am.
When l was a kid, my mother's
best friend used to tell me
that l was gonna be
a little heartbreaker.
Turns out she was right.
Her husband came home
from work one day
and found us fucking
on the Stairmaster.
Los Angeles, California.
That's where all the beautiful little
heartbreakers go to live and dream.
every single month.
and queens
and Little Miss Cute Tits,
every one of them
with stars in their eyes
and a dream in their heart.
When l first came out here,
l had a dream--
a dream of an easy life.
l was gonna get rich
from lyin' around
having my picture taken.
l was gonna live in the hills
and drive a noisy yellow sports car
and fuck 6' girls
who weighed 89 Ibs.
-
- Guess what? Most of it came true.
Hey, handsome!
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
- Excuse me.
- What's up?
-
- Good to see you.
- You're here a little early, man.
- Well, you know, a boy's gotta eat.
#  l don't wanna tell you #
#  'Cause you're lookin'
that way #
#  Turn around and wonder
how you keep up #
#  With things that
l don't want to tell you #
#  'Cause you're lookin'
that way #
#  Turn around and wonder
how you keep up #
#  With things that
l don't... #
Man's voice:
Some men remember breast feeding.
l do not.
l do remember seeing
my mother in the shower once.
She had a giant
mound of pubic hair.
lt caused me an aversion
to all things untrimmed.
Ah. Meet Jen.
She has a bush like the outback.
Strong hands though.
l like that.
Let's see.
Ah, Shelly.
Ladies, if you want tits,
go to Canada.
They just do 'em better up there.
Don't ask me why.
l don't remember her name.
But l do remember the look on her face
when she found out l was
also sleeping with her sister.
But tonight l'm not looking
for the tight skin of a 20-year-old.
l am in need of assiduation
and that changes the game.
Ah, here we go.
The jacket's Dolce,
the jeans are by Helmut Lang
and the complexion comes
from a strict regimen of facials.
l'm guessing
she drives a Mercedes.
By the way,
there's only one pick-up line.
Everything else is cheese.
Hi. What's your name?
- Samantha.
- Hi, Samantha.
l'm Nikki.
- l'm leaving.
- Really?
Why?
- It's late.
- You're right.
We should get going.
So wait a second.
You had dinner here?
What'd you have?
l had a salad.
- What kind of salad?
- A Greek salad.
You had a Greek salad
at a French restaurant?
l like that.
Oh. Valet, huh?
l bet you're a bad driver.
You want me to drive?
l'll flip you for it. Here.
Heads, l drive;
tails, you drive.
- There it is.
- It's tails. You flipped it.
You always flip it.
Don't be a sore loser.
Look, you're cute and everything,
but you're not coming home with me.
Thank you.
You're gonna have to do
better than that.
''You're cute and everything''?
What is that?
l was trying not to be rude.
- You're far from rude.
- Aww.
l'll help you out.
Tell me that you're married.
l am not married.
That would be a lie.
You're not.
Tell me that you're madly in love
with someone.
- That would also be a lie.
- Mm-hmm.
Then tell me why l can't
come home with you.
l don't know you.
Nikki's voice: Roll the windows down,
turn the music up
and make an ass out of yourself.
lt puts them at ease.
lt's nice.
Peter Bogdanovich
used to live here.
Hmm. l bet he did.
What's that supposed to mean?
Nikki's voice:
Never show you're impressed.
lt lowers your market value.
Do you want a drink?
l don't drink.
Come here.
Wait.
No boots in the bed.
lt's my bed.
The boots go or l go.
Nikki's voice:
You want to give them a good fucking,
but not too good. Leave a little
room for the relationship to grow.
- Oh, this fucking--
-
Hey, Nikki.
Nikki, wake up.
l gotta go to work.
Now pay very close attention.
l call this the ''roll over
sleeping smile.''
- Right here is fine.
- There?
Yeah.
Nice spread, man.
Yeah, it is, isn't it?
Hey, do you keep
these cards on file?
Yeah, we can.
Nikki's voice: It doesn't matter
if you can cook or not.
Women grade on effort. It's almost
better when the meal's a flop.
lt shows that you're willing
to make a fool of yourself.
lt's all about creating equity.
Think of it as a point system.
One for flowers, two for dinner,
three for an orgasm.
You need 26 points
for them to trust you.
And then you can go back
to watching football.
- Hello?
- In here.
Oh ho ho, you're still here.
And you're cooking.
- l'm trying.
- Hmm.
Turn around.
Here you go.
Sit down...
and take off your shoes.
l'm gonna go pour you
a glass of wine.
Nikki's voice:
Here's what she doesn't know--
l'm homeless, carless
and completely unreliable.
l do, however,
own a cell phone
that happens to be
right in front of her.
That's right, baby. 19 other offers
and l'm here with you
creating equity.
So what do you do?
What?
For work?
Do you have a job?
No.
What did you do today?
l was here today.
Yesterday--
what did you do yesterday?
Yesterday.
Yesterday, l woke up,
l got a cup of coffee,
l had something to eat,
and then l went outside
to see what it was like.
And what was it like?
lt was nice.
Have you ever had a job?
Yes.
What sort of job?
You know--
jobs on lakes,
jobs on water.
Job-jobs.
Are you looking
for a job right now?
Not right now.
- No?
- No.
Right now,
l'm having dinner with you.
- Is that it?
-
: fire :
#  Me and old Ricardo #
#  We're swooping
down to town #
#  We're coming
round your way #
#  Tonight #
#  So open up your eyes #
#  Then pull back the skies #
#  'Cause we are
coming round #
#  Hick it #
#  That's right... #
That's a lot.
#  That's right. #
Nikki's voice:
Just rack up those points until...
l'm going to New York
for a few days.
l thought you might
want to come.
l can't.
You want to stay here.
Do you want me to stay here?
Yeah, l do.
Then l'll stay.
l have my cell.
l'll leave it on.
Okay.
- Thursday morning you'll pick me up?
- Of course.
- You have a safe flight.
- l hope so.
#  Been so long
since you told me #
#  Been so long since

#  Been so long

Hey!
l don't like you two
talking to each other.
l do not like you two
talking to each other.
This is bad.
- Stop! Stop!
-
- God.
- How do you like my new house?
You think any girls are gonna
believe this is your house?
The young ones do.
Oh FYl, l'm a graphic designer
if anybody asks.
What? What happened?
- l blew it.
- With who?
- El Paso Erin.
- That DJ girl?
No, that's Hi-fi Tara.
No El Paso's a somatologist.
- She's--
- That's--
l fuckin' froze up.
l couldn't say anything.
l-- l started making
cricket noises.
You know what your problem is?
You care too much.
You gotta cut out
the conversation, right?
And just like say something
to piss 'em off.
- Why?
- 'Cause once you piss 'em off,
you set up the apology.
And once you apologize,
you look like a sensitive guy.
l am a sensitive guy.
All right, but you've
gotta look like a rebel
before you look
like a sensitive guy.
- Is that Helen?
- Helen: Oh!
- Who invited her?
- l don't know.
- l didn't fucking invite her.
- She's gonna tell people
- it's not my house.
- Hey, Nikki.
- Hi.
- Yeah, l heard you were having a party
so l thought l'd just
stop by and say hi,
see where you landed.
Yeah, not bad.
Not-- not bad at all.
- So, you want to go swimming?
- Oh whoa!
- Helen, uh, just--
-
Nikki:
Okay, we gotta get her out of here.
- You gotta take her home.
- What?!
Just take her home. she's gonna
blow this whole thing for us.
- l was hoping to meet someone, man.
- Who you gonna meet tonight?
- l don't know.
- Who are you gonna meet?
Nikki.
Hey.
l'm drunk as shit.
Where's my tour?
Your tour's starting right now.
l-- l love you.
- Hey, Helen? Meet Harry.
- Helen: Huh?
Nikki's voice: A tour of the house
should always end in the bedroom.
l like fucking in the kitchen
as much as the next guy,
but you're three times
more likely to get laid
if there's a bed in the room.
- You're good at that.
- l used to be a cheerleader.
- Oh really?
- Mm-hmm.
So you took your pants off a lot?
- What?
- What?
You date the offense
or the defense?
Give me some credit.
Offense.
Offense.
- Mm-hmm.
- Quarterbacks?
- Receivers.
- Mm.
Took a bunch of acid once
and thought my dick was a Dolphin.
l hate the Dolphins.
- l'm a Niners fan.
-
l don't know how l feel about that.
Feels like you like it.
That lady's crazy.
- Crazy good, right?
- No. Just crazy.
She almost got us killed...
trying to grab me,
get my zipper down...
while l'm driving.
- That's a problem?
- She's trying to fuck me
while l'm driving.
l need to see the road.
lt's an important part
of driving.
Somebody's gotta make
the first move, man.
Yeah, well, she wanted to know
if you brought any girls
over to her house
when you were living there.
What'd you say?
What was l supposed to say?
All these things l can say,
things l can't say.
Sometimes l get confused.
What am l supposed to do?
Dude.
- What am l supposed to do?
-
You're an asshole.
l hate you.
Did you show her
the little red Corvette?
But of course... not.
Dude, you didn't fuck her?
How could you not fuck her?
- Fuck you.
- She's got a magical pussy.
- Ain't nothing wrong with it.
- Oh because it's, what,
- been worked on like 30 times maybe?
-
Hey, there's a spare bedroom here
if you want to stay.
- Yeah.
- Don't let me screw this one up, okay?
This is hot.
Yeah, this is prem nice.
Nikki: When you're rich,
it costs more money to stay rich.
Nikki's voice:
l always follow up a meaningless fuck
with a cham phone call.
Heeps me in the game.
Most guys drop the ball
after they ball.
l look ahead.
An easy call the day
after a lay can go a long way.
Hola, amiga!
Lo siento por el mess.
- Hello?
- Hey, where are you?
- Nikki: Uh, l'm at your house.
- Really?
So why didn't you answer the phone?
l called you twice last night.
You did?
How's New York?
Samantha: These guys don't need
a lawyer. They need a babysitter.
So, listen, we have some friends
coming over on Thursday night.
We do?
Samantha: We do.
Do you want to check your schedule?
Yeah, sure.
Hey, Gina, how's my
Thursday night look?
Oh, that's sweet.
So we're on.
- We're on.
- Okay.
- Bye.
- Okay.
Bye.
Announcer:
The home team has first and 10...
Oh my God. You didn't tell me you live
at the top of the fucking globe.
My car overheated,
so l walked up the hill.
This guy offers me a ride.
l say no, but he keeps
following me,
so l ran.
Oh my God.
Is that a ham?
l haven't eaten
since like Thursday.
Cornflakes.
l started this band--
me and this guy.
We tell everyone
we're brother and sister
and then we get
all sexy on stage.
Who are you hustling, Nikk?
- What?
- Mm. The house.
- Who's it belong to?
- Uh...
it used to belong
to Peter Bogdanovich.
Who? Come on, Nikk.
It's me, okay?
Remember me?
l was the first girl
to shave your balls.
You were the first guy
in my ass, l mean--
there were feelings.
lt's not what you think.
You can tell me.
l mean,
it's not like you're getting
any from me.
Nikki's voice: When a girl tells you
you're not getting any,
before you ask,
before you even try,
you're getting some.
Mm-hmm.
What do you tell these women?
Less is more.
Why do you care?
Um, so that when you call me
lonely and miserable
in 10 years,
l can tell you exactly
how you got there.
- Hmm.
- You're a good person, Nikki.
l mean, this can't feel good.
So what's her deal?
How old is she?
l have to be inside you
right now.
Every time we have sex,
you disappear.
- It's not like that--
- You say that every time.
l didn't call you for sex.
l called you because l miss you.
Yeah, but now that l'm here,
you don't miss me anymore
and now you want sex.
- And you don't?
- l want more than sex.
Me too.
What, Nikki?
More what?
l-- l don't know.
It's all very new, this feeling.
You are so full of shit.
You're right.
l am full of shit.
Does she have a bathtub?
You want to shave my papaya?
Be careful with me.
Promise.
l promise.
Nikki's voice:
Lots of times l can envision my future
with a woman before l come.
How long are you gonna
keep doing this?
And then after, l just want them
to stop touching me.
l don't know.
What if we just gave it a try?
l don't want
to do that to you again.
l'm a big girl.
l can handle it.
Maybe you just
don't care about me.
You cool?
Yep, l'm cool.
You know you're
my homegirl, right?
Yeah.
- See ya.
- Drive safe, okay?
Yep.
-
- Oh!
Announcer:
The snap...
Brown kicks it off.
It's 40, at the 45,
he's at the 30, 35...
- Oh yes! Yes!
-
- No!
- Yes!
-
-
- What the hell's wrong with them?
- They suck,
that's what's wrong with them.
- Shut up.
- You shut up.
Jesus Christ.
- Turn it off.
-

- Uh...
- Get out.
- Her?
Her! Get out.
l, uh--
- Announcer: Brown has it.
- --we were watching the game
and, uh, one thing led to--
l'm-- l--
- l'm sorry.
- For what? Getting caught?
How was your little party?
- What party?
- The one my maid cleaned up for you.
Sit down.
Thanks.
See you later.
l trusted you.
l fucking trusted you.
Yeah? Really?
You trusted me?
'Cause it kind of feels like
you came home early
to catch me at something,
but catch me at what?
l don't really know, 'cause we never
really had the conversation.
Oh, the conversation?
You want to have
the fucking conversation?
Okay, how would you
characterize our relationship?
What? l'm--
You want me to characterize
and you can confirm or deny?
- Confirm or deny.
- Yeah, confirm or deny.
We are hopelessly
in love with each other.
Come on! Are we hopelessly
in love with each other?
- No.
- No, of course not.
- No.
- So how about this?
We have a relationship built
on honesty and integrity.
- Samantha, l'm not--
- What? Confirm or deny!
- Well, you want me-- deny!
- Deny is right.
How about this?
l support you
and you perform sexual favors.
ls that what this is about?
- We're friends.
- We're friends?
Friends who...
fuck.
Okay, how about we're
friends who fuck
and you don't
stay here anymore?
- Fine.
- Great.
l don't know how
that's gonna work.
l don't have a car,
so l can't--
it's not-- l can't come over.
And l don't have a place,
so it's not like you can come and...
fuck me,
so, l-- l guess if we're--
and as my friend,
l think you should be
a little bit concerned
that l don't have
a place to live.
You are a real piece of work.
#  Help #
#  Standing at the door,

#  Shaking on my hand... #

They're buttermilk pancakes.
They're supposed to be sour.
Oh, maybe you're right.

Really? You new to LA?
Why? You want

Okay. Maybe you

l don't think so.
Can l get you anything else?
How about a phone number?
Why? 'Cause we're
so compatible?
l don't know. l just thought we'd get
a cup of coffee or something.
When l leave here,
the last thing l want is coffee.
Hey, maybe we could go on a hike?
No. No hikes.
We could just talk.
We're talking now,
and don't take this personally--
it's not that you're not
a brilliant conversationalist--
Okay okay okay.
Why don't you just

Because l don't

Whenever you're ready.
She's hot, huh?
Yeah.

What are you ironing
your pants for?
Can l call you right back?
Yeah. Yeah, no problem.
Just call me back.
All right.
''l'll call you back.''
Doesn't that mean like 15 minutes
or something?
You say it all the time.
You don't call me back in 15 minutes.
- It's been like 12 hours.
-
And that sucks, doesn't it?
Right, look, you're-- you're mad
'cause you can't follow your own advice.
Okay, you can always call a girl.
You can't uncall her.
Come on, man.

- Yeah.
-
Why does all my stuff
smell like mothballs?
'Cause l don't want moths.
Well, what's worse,
moths or mothballs?
l don't know. If you don't like it,
you should take your shit.
Tell you man, between
your mothballs and your frogs.
What's wrong with the frogs?

Are you mad?
Will you ever forgive me?
Maybe someday
when l'm old and gray.
Let's get a table.
Take Camp David, for example.
There's no camping.
How much better would it be
if the four dignitaries
could just pitch a tent
and hang out?
- We'd have Israel, Palestine...
-
...talking out their differences
over a campfire roasting marshmallows.
lt's just that there's a better way to
Iead a superpower into the 21st century.
Hey.
l'm with friends.
She's with the commander in chief.
What are you talking about?
You're a little monkey,

Are you kidding me?
- Who are you fucking?
- Huh?
Who are you fucking?
Nobody.
Liar.
l need you to drive me
to the hospital.
- Nikki: What for?
- Just get dressed.
Why do you go to the hospital?
Not your business.
lt's none of my business.
All right.
Just drop me off.
Pick me up tomorrow.
Oh hey, is Heather here?
No, Heather doesn't
work here anymore.
''Are you alone?''
Yeah.
l love your house.
What are you doing?
Am l interrupting anything?
Yeah. A peanut butter
and jelly sandwich.
What kind of jelly?
lt was jam actually.
Apricot.
l love that you know
the difference.
Hey, what's your deal?
You're having
a good time with someone
and you just take off,
you split.
- What's that?
- Is that what you think?
What l think is that
you have a boyFriend.
- You're wrong.
- Oh right.
Then what was the big emergency?
Who's ''monkey''?
- My little brother.
- Oh. Right.
You know, l just met you.
You really need to know all this?
He has MS.
He's 17 and... incontinent.
You know what that means?
Of course.
Hey.
l smoke sometimes.
Mm.
l'm allergic to cats.
Okay.
l hate my last name.
l really like you.
l don't want to rush this, okay?
Okay.
Will you just hold me?
Yeah.

What are you talking about?
You're a little monkey,
you know that?
You're a little monkey.
You're a fucking whore.
l asked you if you had a boyFriend
and you said no.
l'm waiting tables
and driving an $80,OOO car.
Did you actually
think it was mine?
Get out.
Hey. Hey.
- l missed you.
- You okay?
- Hi.
- Hl.
Let me just tell you a little bit
about vaginal rejuvenation.
What l did was, l took
fat cells from her thighs
and l injected them
into the walls of her vagina
tightening it all up.
So that means no penetration
for five days.
But l think you'll find it
well worth the wait.
- See you soon.
- Okay.
Hey.
You all right?
You didn't come home
all night.
You didn't call.
You didn't answer my calls.
You didn't leave me a note.
No, l'm not all right.
- l'm really sorry.
- You're not sorry.
You know what l meant.
No, l don't know
what you meant.
l know what you fucking said.
Why don't you show some regret?
Why don't you show me
that you're sorry?
Fuck it.
This isn't working out.
Where'd you pick that up?
Junior high?
Oh you're gonna go?
You wanna go?
You're gonna go now? You better
take all the fucking shit l bought you.
- Come on.
- Gucci.
-
- $400 jeans--
- Stop it.
- And fucking--
Stop it.
- Prada--
- Stop it!
l don't want it.
You don't want it?
Let me tell you something.
You are getting older.
You're losing your looks.
And your only charming
'cause you're cute.
You're not really charming.
You're not funny.
And you're not smart,
l hope you understand that.
You're nothing but six inches
and a prem face
and you're gonna have to suffer
just like everybody else.
- It's seven.
- It's not seven.
It's okay.
You'll be okay.
You're gonna be okay.
You hungry?
Want me to make you an omelet?
Where are you gonna go?
l don't know.
How long do you think it'll be before
you come crawling back here?
l don't know.
S-- Samantha!
- Say goodbye to the little cunts.
- Fuck!
lf you like me so much,
tell me what you like about me.
l like that you're smart...
and you're interesting...
and you don't take shit
from people...
and l like who l am
when l'm with you.
See?
lt's not even about me.
You don't give a shit about me.
- Well, that's not true.
- Yeah?
Then why don't you
ask me any questions?
Ask you any quest--
what do you mean?
- That's a question right there.
- No, l mean like
''Hey, Em, how's your band?''
''How's your sick mom, Emily?''
- Well, l'm not a question asker.
-
- You know what it's like?
- You're gonna say l'm not --
lt's just like l can't tell if you're--
l don't know if it's me,
or if-- or if you're just afraid.
Afraid? l'm afraid of what?
lntimacy.
- And you're not.
- No, l'm not.
Oh come-- all right, that's why
you're with someone right now?
Don't you ever think that maybe you
just haven't met the right person yet?
You know, l feel like
when l meet that person,
that l'll ask the right questions.
This is a waste of time.
You can't stay here.
You-- you tell me
that l'm afraid.
And then the minute l get real,
you're gonna kick me out.
- You want me to get real with you?
- Yeah.
Okay, l have always been
attracted to you, okay?
But that is it.
'Cause l don't find you
remotely interesting.
- You don't mean that.
- Yeah, l do. l think you're vacuous.
And you fuck women for stu_?
You're a whore.
ls everything okay?
Yeah, it's fine.
Harry. Hey, where are you?
Where?
- Nikki?
- Yeah yeah.
l'm Sean. l'm Harry's buddy
from high school.
Very very nice.
That girl's hot.
How are you?
l love you.
You're fucking hot.
Harry, yo, l gotta talk to you.
Harry.
Oh my goodness. Hi.
You are fucking gorgeous.
Let's do this right now.
Let's just start.
Hey, hi, how are you?
Hi, nice to meet you.
Can l just--
can you lean back for a second?
All right? Wow?
- Will you rub your box for me?
- All right.
- That's not--
- Rub your box for me, come on.
Rub your box for Daddy.
Fucking love it.
- Dude, what the fuck?
- Come on, come on. Rub your box.
Yo, come on, man.
- No, they like that.
- No, that's not cool.
- That's not cool.
- Will you rub your box for me?
Just like rub your box for me
like you were in the shower.
- Nikki: Don't talk to her like that.
- Sean: No, they like that.
Did you wash your ass, actually?
Can l smell?
- What the fuck, man?
- That would be great.
You little fucking whore!
- Okay. What the--
- Harry: Hey hey hey!
Hey, what are you doing, man?
lt's a fucking strip club, man.
Come on, man.
That girl's straight off the bus
from like Hansas or whatever.
You don't talk to her like that.
She's a human being, man.
Are you kidding me?
You objecti_ women more than anyone.
What if that girl
was your sister, man?
Dude, l wouldn't let you within
And you wouldn't even go after her
'cause she doesn't have the right car
or the right house, right?
Well, you should've told me that
before l fucked her.
Smelled like Teen Spirit, man.
Fuck you.
Get the fuck out of my face.
Here comes your boyFriend.
- Think l can slip in?
- Sorry, bro, not tonight, man.
- No, you're kidding me, right?
- Not my call.
Come on.
l'm sorry.
- You're joking, right?
- It's not us tonight. It's a buyout.
-
-
Come on, man.
l said l was sorry.
You're always sorry.
Just take your shit.
l got nowhere to go, man.
l'm sure you're gonna figure it out.
#  Baby girl, hold on... #
Unbelievable.
It's unbelievable.
You guys have--
what-- what about the sweater?
- What'll you give me for the sweater?
- Nine bucks.
Nine bucks?!
No, that's rob-- fine.
You know what?
Take it. Take it.
#  You give it u-u-u-up #
#  Baby girl, hold on #
#  l won't let go-o-o-o #
#  l won't let go... #
l'm good. Yeah, things are good.
Real good.
Woman:
You've been out there for a long time.
Are you working?
Yeah.
l'm up for a couple jobs.
They're, um--
they're big campaigns actually,
so if l get one
it could be real good.
Hello?
Mom?
#  Hold on, it's just
you and me... #

Hollywood Hollywood #
#  You can be a big star,

Nikki's voice:
When l first came here,
l thought every day was
gonna be a Van Halen video--
hot chicks wearing bikinis
riding around on roller skates
drinking cocktails by the pool.
Damn you, Van Halen.
#  All the fallen leaves will find
their branches again #
#  Raindrops from the heavens,
l'll eventually swim #
#  A river, an ocean,
a wave in my heart #
#  We got your money,

#  All the fallen leaves

#  Heart... #
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Swimming.
Look,
l'm sorry about what happened,
but this is not fucking cool.
What happened?
l called you an asshole.
l kicked you out.
l called you a whore.
l'm sorry.
That's strange.
'Cause it seems like you and l
are maybe playing the same cards.
- Yeah.
- Last time l checked, you were living
in a $5 million house. Now you're
turning tricks for a sandwich.
- Nikki: l'm not turning anything.
- Tell me something, though--
out of everybody here, why her?
l don't think you understand
my situation, okay?
l'm about to get evicted
from the Sahara Motor Inn.
l'm selling my near-mint
sweaters for nine bucks.
And the club sandwich is gonna be
the first thing l've had to eat all day.
l don't really have time
to be picky.
Going up to my suite.
Are you coming?
He'd like to know if your AmEx
is silver or black?
l'll buy him a sandwich...
you ram bitch.
- This is us?
- Is that okay?
What? Are you scamming
a schoolteacher now?
- Used car salesman.
-
l hate the furniture.
Don't look at it.
My roommate's a total pothead.
She never comes out of her room.
-
- So what happened to Mercedes?
l told her it wasn't working out.
- What about the Porsche?
- Turned into an asshole.
l got back at him though.
l sold his cigars on eBay.
Dougie.
l don't know.
Where you been looking?
Actually, l was on my way to do
some grocery shopping.
Bristol Farms on Doheny.
You said you wanted to see me.
Great.
When are you picking me up?
Perfect.
See you then, baby.
Ciao.
What do you want for dinner?
Cheers to that.
This wine would be better after 2012.
Maybe we should wait.

Heather's voice:
We're not in. Leave a message.
Woman's voice: Hey, it's me.
You know Douglas Dukes,
that video game billionaire? l guess
he just broke up with what's-her-name.
And he and his boys
are going to Les Trois tonight.
l can't go,
but l put you on the list.
- Have fun.
-
You gonna keep stepping
on my dress like that?
All night long l'm stepping
on your dress like that.
Two shots of tequila, please.
- Got him.
- Where?
Next to the girl in the yellow.
Not bad.
- Hmm.
- Can l have a gin and tonic?
- What are we drinking to?
- Trouble.
- Laugh.
- What?
l just said something funny.
Laugh.
Well done.
- l try.
- Any more moves?
- Can you dance?
- Can l dance?
#  Why aren't you
coming anymore? #
#  Why aren't you
coming anymore? #
Nikki's voice: They say you gotta kiss
a lot of frogs to find your prince.
But in this town,
everyone thinks they're royalty.
And the frogs
don't stand a chance.
- l want 150/o.
- You're out of your mind.
Fine, 12.
Four and that's my final offer.
- What are you, my pimp?
-
Look, l--
Oh man.
All l need's a blanket.
l don't need all those
sheets and everything.
l don't want you getting
your funk all over.
My funk.
Yeah, you can't wash a couch.
- Night.
- Hey, thank you.
l'd let you sleep in my bed,
but, um, l wouldn't
want you to get confused.
Good night.
The, uh, couch is--
the couch is a little short.
So, l'm-- l'm just gonna--
just gonna lie
down here like this.
-
- l'm on the side, away from you.
You won't even know l'm here.
- Okay, l'll take the couch.
- No. No no no.
No, wait. Wait.
- What?
- What are you afraid of?
You really think l'm gonna
make a pass at you?
- You're in my bed.
- And?
You don't-- you don't think you can
keep your hands off me, huh?
Please!
We're adults. l think
we can control ourselves.
Whatever.
Sorry.
For what?
What? l nudged you, didn't l?
l didn't feel anything.
Well, l-- l-- l brushed up
against your foot like that.
l felt that.
Do you feel that?
That tickles.
Like good tickles or bad tickles?
Just tickles.
l can tell you're smiling
and l can't even see your face.
How many times
have you used that line?
Oh, l don't know.
But l'm not just saying it
to get your pants off.
My pants are already off.
Oh.
What are we doing?
Why do we have to be doing anything?
This is not a good idea.
lf l don't kiss your right now,
my face is gonna fall off.
- All right.
- There.
Oh, l need more than that.
For what?
See if l like it.
lf you like it?
Yeah.
Like it?
- l didn't like that at all.
-
- Really?
- Yeah.
So none of that was true?
l don't have a brother.
Well, l knew that.
But l'm from Canada.
- l'm sorry about that.
-
So when'd you decide to stop
playing Mata Hari with me?
What makes you
so sure l stopped?
You're two drinks in
and you're already bragging
about all your lies.
l could drink you
under the table.
- Oh come on.
- Oh my God--
- Nikki, hi.
- Hey.
- How are you? Hi.
- Hey.
Hey, remember me?
Yeah, of course.
- What's my name?
- Your name.
My name.
l'm blanking out.
Um, l'm blanking.
You don't remember.
That was fucked up.
- Sorry.
- Don't be sorry.
She's a jerk.
Chew this into your food.
- Mm?
- Yeah.
- Oh-- ah!
- Oh my God. Waiter!
- How can l assist?
- l don't want to cause a scene,
but there's garbage in the food.
We're leaving now.
- Wow.
- l'm sorry, sir.
- Come on.
- Yeah, l'm coming, honey.
How long do you think
it takes for it to set?
- l don't know, like 20 seconds?
- See the dolphin?
You see the dolphins?
There's freaking dolphins out there.
- Oh!
- See it?
- Yeah.
- There's freaking dolphins.

You gotta fucking

He's my fiancé.
Why didn't you tell me?

When's the last time
you talked to him?
Yesterday.
When's the last time
you saw him?
- Don't do this.
- Don't do what?
What am l doing?
Like it's a big surprise.
He's rich.
- His family owns the Rangers.
- Which one,
Texas or New York?
New York.
Well, fuck, what'd you
break up with him for?
He sounds like a fucking catch.
- You know why.
- No, l don't.
Honestly, l don't
know what to think.
Because l love you.
Happy? l said it.
- Do you love him?
- No.
Well...
l don't think l was
faking it all the time.
Are you faking it with me?
Why would l fake it?
You don't have a dime
or a job or a fucking plan.
What would l fake for?
- Where are you going?
- l don't know.
l don't have a fucking plan.

Don't burn down the house.
Big hug. Heather.''
Just come back.
You-- don't leave.

Hey. What are you doing?
You want to watch the game?

Heather:
Are you mad?
No, l was worried.

lt's been hard to get away.
Nikki:
Are you with him now?
No, l'm not with him.
Baby, l'm sorry.

We're not gonna do that anymore.

Who's the girl?
lt's-- she's just a friend.
l was-- she was drunk
and l didn't want her
to drive and so l--
l told her that
l would take her home.
What kind of car does she have?
This isn't funny anymore!
lt's a Mercedes,

Heather:
l've gotta go.
No, baby, don't-- don't--

You're an asshole.

Where's Heather?
That's what l'm

- What is your name?
- Nikki.
- l'm Eva.
- Hey.
Sure means certain.
Prem sure

Okay, l'm sure.
Okay. Then you need to act.

Get on a plane?

What kind of commitment?
A commitment.

Close the door.
You shouldn't have come here.

This isn't real.
You know this isn't real.
This is bullshit.
l've been here.
You can't be happy.
Come here.
Come here.
Come with me.
Let's go.
Go get your stuff.
l can't.
Why not?
Say we go back to LA.
Then what?
Get an apartment?
They want first, last and security.
That's five grand.
Where do we get that?
Hmm?
- We'll figure it out.
- You're not a realist.
You're a dreamer
and it scares me.
lt's not a diamond.
l want to spend
the rest of my life with you.
Marry me.
Be my wife,
to have and to hold
and all that.
We're already married.
No. You can get a divorce.
l can't.
Why not?

Man:
Hey, l'm home.

Honey, um, do you have a five
for the grocery boy?
Oh sure, yeah, hey.
Thanks, man.
- Thanks. Hey.
- Thank you!
- Hello.
- Hi.
#  Good morning, dear #
#  l hope l didn't

#  Because my mind #
#  Is growing tired #
#  Too much thinking
what l should do #
#  l picture you #
#  Out there #
#  It must be beautiful #
#  This time of year #
#  All those East Coast leaves #
#  Floating round like embers #
#  From burning trees #
#  Well, the weather out here #
#  Is just the same #
#  But the garden #
#  That you planted #
#  Remains... #
Nikki's voice:
When you're a kid, it's LA
that teaches you how to dream.
Tell me that you didn't learn more from
the movies than you did from school,
more from TV than you did
from your parents.
And what do we learn?
We learn to believe in fairy tales.
Hey.
- How are you?
- Do you want to-- l'm good.
You?
l'm great.
Thank you.
Take care, Nikki.
You too.
#  'Cause everything
around me has changed #
#  But the garden #
#  That you planted #
#  Remains. #
You know why the departures
and the arrivals at LAX
are on separate levels?
So the 30,OOO heartbreakers
that come here each month
don't notice the 30,OOO that are leaving
with their hearts broken.
My whole life, it was obvious
l was gonna end up in this city.
l'm still here.
