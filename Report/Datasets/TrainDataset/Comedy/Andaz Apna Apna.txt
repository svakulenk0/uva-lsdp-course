Excuse me! Can I help you?
Goodness!
It's Juhi Chawla!
I've to attend a shoot and
my car's broken down.
Can you give me a lift?
I?!
Why not? Please come!
I'm very fortunate to have found you.
I'll never forget this favor of
yours for the rest of my life.
No favor at all!
This is only my duty.
They don't 'make' them
like you anymore.
Madam's arrived!
Hurry up!
You will meet me again, won't you?
Why did you summon me
so suddenly, Miss Juhi?
There was no reason, really.
I just felt like meeting you.
It's a very romantic place, isn't it?
Yes, it is.
There are times when I think of
the fate that would befall me...
...if I didn't have these strong
shoulders supporting me.
Give me your word... you
will always be with me!
What's this you're saying, Miss Juhi?
Not 'Miss Juhi'... simply Juhi!
- Goodness! Govinda?!
- Who are you?
Meet Mr. Amar, Govinda.
Haven't I told you about him?
So, he's the one who helped
you at every step, eh?
You're a very handsome young man.
Your tastes are improving, Juhi!
She's feeling shy...
Listen, when you're so handsome,
why don't you try a career in films?
I've received many offers.
But I'm being selective...
Come into my arms!
No, Gopal!
This can't be!
Why not?
Only because I'm poor?
And you're rich? No power
on earth can keep us apart!
Come into my arms!
But try to understand a
woman's helplessness, Gopal!
This heartless world...
...this world full of enemies will not let us live.
- And that is the truth.
- The truth is that you love me!
You love me and I love you.
Only this is true...
...the rest is fake! Forget it!
Come and embrace me!
Embrace her tightly, Govinda!
- What happened?!
- I felt Shah Rukh Khan had arrived!
Shah Rukh Khan, Sunny Deol, Govinda
...they're the ones in your life!
I'm told you're doing many films with Sunny?
Yes.
People like us paired together.
- And you?
- I like it, too.
He's very handsome.
Why did you ask?
Are you feeling jealous?
I'm afraid I might kill someone!
You're upset?
I was only joking.
You're everything to me...
...you're my beloved.
It's true, Amar.
I can't live without you now.
Let's get married somewhere.
- Oh yes!
- I'll quit acting for you!
No!
There's no need to do that!
Go ahead and act. I'll handle
everything, including the money!
But I'll choose your lead-men.
And you must maintain a distance!
I treat God as witness and...
...accept you with all my heart and soul.
I too treat God as witness and...
...accept you with heart, soul and wealth!
Oh, Dad!
You ruined my beautiful dream!
Did you have to arrive just as
I was about to marry the heroine?
- Couldn't you wait for 2 minutes?
- Shut up and get up!
He sits at the cash-counter and goes to sleep.
Haven't I told you, Babulal, not
to let him near the cash-counter?
How much of money does your
cash-counter have anyway?
A beggar of Bombay would have
more loose change than you do!
Be careful, Babulal. Don't cut his
ear off, like you did yesterday.
- Careful!
- How can currency notes be here?
He took a hundred rupees
yesterday and blew it up!
Not blew it up,
I 'spent' it.
I had a haircut at
Taj Mahal's saloon yesterday.
What?! I shave a hundred people
to put together Rs. 100/...
...and you tip people at the Taj?!
Your hair hasn't been cut, too!
They've been cut in a style you can never tell.
Speaking a lot of English, eh?
You fool! It was with the 'change'
from this cash-counter that I...
...got you educated with;
threats and intimidation's.
I somehow got you into college, too.
But they even kicked you out of there!
I wasn't kicked out...
I quit on my own!
In fact, the Principal couldn't
understand what I said.
I have many ideas in my
brains... dying to pop out!
They're meant for the nation,
and for this generation...
And especially so, for the fathers!
Because, till the parent does not
improve, the nation cannot, too!
The Principal's son could understand this...
...but the Principal couldn't.
But you...
I'll shave off your hair
without even applying water!
Oh come on, Pop!
If you shave my hair, people'll think you've...
- Shut up, donkey!
- Peace, father, peace...
I have a new idea.
Why don't we sell this shop?
We'll get good money.
I mean, we can open a
bangles-shop with that money.
- A bangles-shop?
- Yes. A bangles-shop.
Just imagine...
...we'll be surrounded by beautiful faces all day.
I'll make the daughter's try out the bangles...
...while you will be busy with the mothers.
The sound of laughter...
and the meeting of eyes...
...the spread of their tresses
and the slipping of their veils!
Their pretty and delicate hands
will be in your fat, ugly paws!
You'll very lovingly make
them wear the bangles.
They'll gracefully make sounds of protest.
You will, meanwhile, make noises of mischief!
I told you to take care of his ears!
- It's because of you!
- Because of me?!
You're distracting him!
Get out! Get out!
Watch it, Pop. I can't say about
you, but I command respect here.
Respect indeed!
You steal change from the counter!
You beggar!
Pretending to be a hero, eh?
You're angry now, father.
I'll explain it this evening.
You mean you will return in the evening?!
No father can possibly have
such a useless son as you are!
Indeed there must be!
Like father, like son!
My left-eye's twitching a lot today.
That's considered to be a good omen!
You'll receive good news from everywhere.
Good news, my foot!
The day I became a father
was the last of my good days!
From that day to the present...
...my son Prem has never given
me the opportunity to be happy!
I make the hard-earned
money, and he blows it up!
Who are you cribbing about?
My son!
But what brings you here?
Have you forgotten?
You owe the moneylender Rs.500.
What nonsense!
Oh yes!
The money must be paid, right?
Here's the money in
Prem has cleaned out my money-box!
Why are you making excuses?
That poor chap's sitting at "Wow Wow Studios"
- "Wow Wow Studious", eh?
- Yes.
The film-bug, Johny, has bitten him real badly!
He's swindling my son!
This Johny had sent my father to
Bombay, promising a career in films!
He still hasn't returned!
You find him standing like this in
the crowd scenes in some films.
He's conning my son, this Johny!
Where's my stick?
Wow!
What a face!
What a mug!
It's the only one of its kind!
- What was that?
- I spat to ward off evil!
Well, teacher,
I'll become a star, won't it?
'Become' a star?
You're already a star, pal!
Get on with the
Production now!
It's already started.
I've even spoken to Amitabh.
- What about me?
- You'll play the main lead!
He'll only play your father.
- Will he 'do'?
- Do?! It's more than done!
Amitabh and I... the father and the son...
...and the ensuing clash between the two!
Wow!
What a scene!
Steaming hot... the tea at
"Wow Wow Productions"
Here you are, sir!
Get him a cold drink.
Any news of the call we were
to receive from Subhash Ghai?
Oh, that?!
It's due any moment!
I had sent your photographs to Subhash Ghai.
He needs a new 'mug' like
yours, for a film he's making.
It's called
'The Romance of Dracula"
Don't forget my role!
Yes, 'Subbu'?
It's Subhash Ghai on the line!
Convey my respects, too, Sir!
Did you like the photographs?
What?! It's created a furors
in the whole of Bombay?!
Have people liked it so much?
What?!
Oh no...
Is that so?
He showed your photographs to Madhuri Dixit.
What did she say?
She'll work only with him?
And with nobody else?!
That's wonderful!
She even kept a snap of his with herself?!
Oh no!
There are two heroines in the film.
He's spoken to Juhi, too.
She has your address.
She'll be here to meet you.
Will both of them 'do'?
'Do' did you ask?!
Of course they will!
Hey, get up!
Listen to me...
Your work is now accomplished.
But the respect and honor of
"Wow Wow Productions" is ruined!
The shopkeeper says that if he
does not get Rs.500/- immediately...
...he'll take away your camera from here!
I try to give the
Film Industry new faces...
...and they want to take away my camera!
It's only a camera, after all.
Not his good-fortune!
- Give away the camera!
- Wait!
He wants to pay up!
Give it to him...
Throw this money in his face!
I'll do the hitting on your face!
You're squandering away
my money on this baldie!
- He's making me a star!
- A star, eh?
He can't be a peon himself!
I'll make you the hero in my film, too, uncle!
You old sinner!
You've even conned my father!
And you're pretending to be young, eh?
Listen carefully...
...if you fool my foolish son any further...
...I'll put a needle in one ear
and pull it out of your other!
I'll seal your ears, not to speak of shut mouths!
Call me a fool if you like, but
I'll achieve something in life!
- Hello!
- Hello, yourself!
Stitch-up your lips and hold the
tailors' scissors in your hand!
- I can't do that, father!
- Can't do it?
Would you like a begging-bowl then?
No, father...
I can see my goal ahead!
There's the Police Station
and the graveyard ahead!
Which of the two is your goal, son?
How do I explain?
The 'star' of my destiny, is about to shine!
Is it true that you've come
to India only to get married?
Yes.
What's so surprising?
The only daughter of the
filthy-rich Ramgopal Bajaj...
...you've been to the whole of the world.
But why did you choose
India to get married?
I mean, why the Indian boys.
I believe that people here
are in love with love...
I mean, they use their hearts, not their brains.
I too am looking for one such crazy chap.
You'll find him!
It's a country of crazy people!
You'll find thousands of them!
You haven't said something, have you?
- You've heard nothing, right?
- Oh nothing!
I spoke a little.
Can something go wrong if I speak?
You say something, they
understand another thing...
...they understand little, but write a lot...
...they write here, it's published elsewhere...
...whatever is published, is strange...
...and that strange something
could lead to everything strange!
Yes...
It'll lead to something.
Who are you, 'Miss Something'?
This is Karisma.
She's my...
One last question.
If you come across two boys...
...one intelligent and the other
large-hearted, whom will you choose?
They will both be rejected.
Because she likes boys a bit large-hearted.
And intelligent, too.
Isn't Mr. Rustom there?
Why does she sell stale eatables?
How are you, Amar?
Hasn't the strike been called off, Mr. Ahmed?
- No, it's still continuing.
- I can't understand Govt. Policies.
For all that the leaders do, we pay for it, right?
Looks like I'll have to do something.
The bum's arrived at last!
Are you newly employed?
Switch on the fan.
The old thing can fall on your head at any time.
The Beauty from London now in India.
In search of an eligible bachelor.
What a babe!
She looks like a film-star!
She's come here to get married.
Go on and read...
The person whom she marries
will inherit Rs.50 crores!
- Besides two factories in London.
- A diamond-business in Switzerland!
There's a farmhouse, too!
She's not a girl, she's a jackpot!
That's enough!
This news is for me!
- For you?!
- Of course!
- She's my heroine!
- Am I dead, then?!
She's here in India, only for me!
Bravo, my boy!
Manage to trap her just once...
...like I've trapped you... I mean,
like I've made you the hero...
...and bring her here.
Our "Wow Wow Productions" will then
become an international company.
After which, we'll make films only in English.
We'll need lots of money for this!
Money can be arranged.
Sell your father's shop and his house.
Give me half the money, and
vanish with the other half.
I'll sit here and finalize the
story, set-up and music.
Only bring the girl, and become a star.
You ungrateful wretch!
You compete with me, before my very shop!
It's not my own business, sir, it's yours!
Amar drove everybody out of the shop, sir.
I wonder what's happened to Amar.
He's mumbling to himself!
Mumbling to himself?!
You?!
Hats off to you!
I always knew you had it...
But so much!
Amar salutes you!
- What's going on?
- I asked you stand outside.
- You donkey!
- Father?! It's you!
I was awaiting you.
You're great! You're exemplary!
There's no father like you!
You're worth worshipping.
You're supreme!
In fact, I've realized that you're not even man...
You're a great-soul!
Great! Simply superb!
You're the Knowledgeable One!
At last you've heard my prayers, O Lord!
He did that 26 years ago!
Where are your feet?
I want to fall at them!
Oh forget it, son.
But tell me...
...what did you suddenly discover in me?
You don't know your own virtues, father!
You're so great, because you
happen to be Amar's father!
I recognize you now.
Everybody will, too, in the future.
They'll say, "there goes Amar's father"
The cops will say that, too!
"There goes Amar's father"
Whenever I'm happy, you
seem to be sad, father!
What else can I do?
As and when you've been happy,
I've been ruined.
Do you remember, when I
first bought you a bicycle?
You were very happy.
But you crashed into my father's legs.
And till the time he died, he
was known as the lame-duck.
The next time you were happy was when...
...I bought you a firework
called Ram Bharose Rocket...
...you fired it, and burnt down Gupta's shop.
I'm still paying for the damages.
The third time you were happy was when...
...you pulled the string from your aunt's slip...
Forget the past!
I'm about to do something for which I was born!
And what is that?
Stop worrying and imagine...
...a cigar worth Rs.50 in your hand
instead of a 50 paise 'beedi'!
And a hat instead of this cap!
A suit and imported shoes!
- How does it feel, dad?
- Great!
But how will all this be possible?
- I'm going to marry a rich girl!
- Is it?
We'll be rich after that!
I'll open many such shops for you.
Then why don't you get married quickly?
You'll have to sell off your
third-rate saloon for that...
...and give me Rs.25,000!
Rs. 25,000/-?!
You won't get a penny!
Get out!
Out you go!
Here's the money.
Return the 25 paise.
The big noise you make for 25 paise!
That's how I've built this house of mine!
Hi! How was your pilgrimage?
Could you see the deity?
There was a big crowd...
...but somehow I managed to get in.
What's the noise for? Has the
money lender's house been sold?
Not the moneylender's; your house's sold.
My house is sold?!
Hold this!
...who sold it?!
But why are you dragging me?
- Keep the stuff down!
- Father!
He even screams!
F-A-T-H-E-R!
- What's it, son?
- Who's this?
- He's Liyaqat.
- Liyaqat who?
He owns a butcher's shop at Chimney Street.
You mean he'll slaughter animals
instead of using the scissors!
- Who are you?
- Who am I?
I own this house.
I went out and you occupied it!
So what if you did!
So, it's you, eh?
Greetings!
When were you discharged from the hospital?
Your son said you were being
treated for a mental disorder.
Mental disorder?
What's all this?
You have a good son.
He said he needed money
for his father's treatment.
I gave him Rs. 22,000 for this house.
He took the money!
This is my ancestral property, Sir!
It used to be.
It no longer is.
I'll deal with you, Prem!
Bravo, Babulal, my loyal friend...
...you're continuing my business even outside!
Not your business anymore, sir.
It's my own, this time.
Your business is closed.
Your shop has been sold!
Amar sold it to Shankar when
you went away for 2 days.
Your son has sold this shop to me.
I'll sell bangles in this shop now!
He left a note for you.
Wealth worth Rs.50 crores.
The only heir.
I had seen her when she was small.
The poor thing will see
very few days of her youth.
She's coming to India to get married...
It's funny how death drags
a person all over the world.
It's good... it'll be an interesting game to play.
Ask Bhalla to take D'Souza's
place at Shanti Villa.
Yes, sir.
But Mr. Bhalla has a fantastic idea, sir...
...why don't we throw D'Souza
from a cliff at Junagadh...
Keep Bhalla's ideas to yourself.
How each card of this game has to be dealt...
...is something
I know very well.
This is the biggest game of my life.
I'll make each and every move very carefully.
None of them is any good, Robert!
They all have some defect or the other.
Coming to India was a waste of time!
I'm very angry with my manager, D'Souza!
How dare he present such pictures to me!
- Where is he, by the way?
- He's no more, Madam.
Who are you?
Who's he, Robert?
He's our new manager.
The name's Vinod... but everybody
in town calls me Bhalla.
- But where's D'Souza?
- Yes?
He's 'off', Madam.
He means D'Souza is on a long-holiday.
Now I will make all the arrangements here.
I can't figure out anything.
Okay, you may leave now.
Madam wants to rest, and we've got work to do.
Oh Mother!
It was the same again.
Okay, please go ahead.
- You go ahead.
- No, you go on.
- Go ahead.
- Please do.
A couple of aristocratic gentlemen
lost their train in this manner.
Mr. Raj Kapoor has dealt
with this in detail in 'Bobby'.
So, before the bus departs,
let me get in. You can follow me.
Oh sure! Please do!
Come on...
- What do you do?
- Nothing.
I mean, I don't have to work at all.
My father has made a pile.
He's got a flourishing business.
What business?
We're into garments.
We export garments...
Nothing is sold here... everything is exported!
You must have heard the name...
Chaudhary and Sons!
Oh yes!
Chaudhary and Sons!
- I've heard the name.
- You have?
The raw material you use, is from our company.
The Mehta Group... it's a very big company.
We give a lot of people goods on credit...
I think Chaudhary and
Sons owes us money, too.
That's okay.
I'll check the accounts!
"Mehta Textiles!"
"When there's no Chaudhary & Sons
how can there be Mehta Textiles?"
"Chaudhary & Sons, eh?"
"He looks like a worker in
an Indian-smokes factory!"
"The bloody rotten mango!"
Where did you buy that cap from?
From France?
Oh no, it's from Switzerland.
I go there very often.
I like the Sunset there.
The cap's very nice, too.
It looks good on you.
"He looks like an ape with
a watermelon on his head!"
Where did you get this jacket from?
Is it a Chaudhary & Sons product?
- Oh no.
- It must be from America then.
Oh no,
I got it from New York.
Oh?!
I thought it was American.
"He's as big a liar as I am"
"He looks like a monkey
retired from the circus!"
- Where are you both going?
- To Ooty.
- I'm going to Ooty, too.
- Is it? You too?
- We seem to have the same goal.
- We'll have a nice trip.
EROS
Hey! What are two cups for?
Take away one of them!
- I'll also have tea.
- We'll share the tea, pal!
- It strengthens friendship.
- Does it?
Go on and drink.
We're not sharing tea, my friend.
We're sharing love.
What are you doing? I'll pay!
Take the money back!
- But why?
- It's not fair. Take it back!
- It doesn't matter.
- It does. Take it back!
- That's no friendship...
- Okay.
- I'll take it...
- Pay for it, if you insist.
But I'll pay the next time.
You can't always pay it!
Hey Danny boy!
Take this.
Our friendship will set an
example in the days to come.
Amar! Look at that... your future sister-in-law!
Are you getting married to Madhuri Dixit?
No, not that picture.
The one below that.
She's not my sister-in-law,
but yours, understand?
- Amar, our friendship...
- To hell with it!
I'll get married to her!
- You're doing a somersault!
- So what?
I could tell from the look of you!
Marry Raveena, my foot!
Do you know how you look
in that two-penny cap?
It looks like a watermelon on an ape's head!
Insult?! And you?! This jacket
from the street-shops...
...makes you look like a
retired monkey from a circus!
- Bloody monkey!
- Rotten-mango! I won't spare you!
I won't spare you!
Careful!
Rascals! Getting into fights?!
I'll lock you up!
- Come on!
- We won't fight, Sir!
Our bags are in the bus, sir!
Peace! Peace!
That's a good combination!
This looks like a new
Police Station, sir.
It's brand new!
- Sir, they...
- Quiet. We're talking.
- You remain quiet.
- It's new. Built in 2 months.
- Sir, they both...
- I know they’re Amar and Prem.
You mustn't interfere when
there are big people talking.
- Quiet!
- But they were...
Everything here is new; including the furniture!
I'm only waiting for someone to cut the 'ribbon'.
The lock-up will have to
be inaugurated, you see!
For that, I need a thief, a rascal, a loafer...
...he'll inaugurate the
lock-up and I'll enjoy myself!
We'll take your leave now, sir.
It's been a pleasure meeting you.
I'd brought them here for the inauguration, sir!
They're both ruffians.
They were fighting it out on the streets!
- It wasn't me. It was him!
- Yes, sir...
- No, sir! It was him.
- He started it, sir.
- He hit me first, sir.
- But who kicked first?
- Why did you abuse me?
- Didn't you abuse me, too?
But I didn't abuse him, sir!
- I'll lock both of you!
- Look at my face, sir...
...do I look capable of fighting?
I'm a follower of non-violence, sir.
He's a liar, sir.
He's being 'misled' by your looks!
- He thinks you're a fool!
- Fool?!
He called you a fool!
He abused you!
I too could have called you
a donkey? But did I? No!
Because I know that your
appearance is deceptive.
The two of you are calling me
names in 'my' Police Station!
Where is it...
I'll shoot you both!
He abused you. Lock him up!
Let me go!
The Inspector's busy... to
hell with the Commissioner!
It was the Commissioner's phone!
He's put you to trouble, sir!
Look at his audacity!
He wants me locked up!
I know you're great and have
recognized him at the first glance!
He's flattering you, sir!
- He's cut the ribbon, sir!
- There's less of sugar.
- Get some sugar!
- He had your tea, sir!
My tea!
Throw him in the cell, sir!
He drank my tea; called me names!
I'm fed up with both of you!
- Can we go, sir?
- N-O!
I'll deal with both of you separately.
With me first, sir.
I'm in a hurry.
I'm not in a hurry, sir!
Go away... go and sit there.
Go!
- Sit down.
- He waves his gun for nothing!
I had picked Prem's pocket.
Let me see how much 'bread'
the bloody millionaire has!
The bloody ape!
Is there nothing?
"Shame on you, thief?!"
Okay...
Go and sit there.
- But, sir...
- Sit down there!
- Come here.
- Who? I?
Come here!
Oh Mother!
- Listen to me!
- But... sir...
I'll show you something instead.
Come with me...
Come with me and
look at this...
...I've brought the thief you were looking for!
Don't let his innocent face deceive you!
He is, in fact, a dangerous criminal!
Now lock him up, after
charging him appropriately.
Wait a minute...
What are you looking at me and the snap for?
Look at him and then at the snap!
- That's not me, Sir!
- Shall we go?
He's a twin-brother!
"My father always said I'd
make a big name for myself"
Give him a big hand!
"Our darling son will
accomplish something so big..."
Here's your wallet.
Would I leave your wallet,
when you had picked mine?
It has 5 bucks.
You'll need the dough. Bye!
There's no vacant room in this lodge.
- Give me a cot then.
- There's no cot, too!
I'll manage under the cot, too.
- Now listen...
- Look. God's looking at you!
Like you, I'm
His devotee too!
I'll die, if I don't find place to sleep today.
Suppose I die, my blind sister...
...and my poor mother, who's a widow...
My blind sister and my mother who's a widow...
God! I was about to commit a grave sin!
- Listen, I have a room upstairs.
- It'll do.
- There's a lot of stuff there...
- It will do.
- Let's go.
- You're not a man...
- What?!
- You're a Great Soul!
Don't talk...
Just listen.
Where have you brought me, Mr. Sewaram?
Don't talk. Only listen.
- You don't snore, do you?
- Oh no.
There's a graveyard nearby;
the dead shouldn't complain.
Have a bath between 1 and 2 in
the morning when there's water.
- Between 1 and 2 in the morning...
- Don't talk. Listen...
Don't mess with the ceiling-fan.
It can fall anytime.
And don't switch on the
lights after Sunset.
But it's only after Sunset...
What I mean is how will I change?
Why do you need lights
to change your clothes?
Take them off and go to sleep!
- Do you plan to show something?
- Oh no!
The fatso doesn't even allow
the lights to be switched on!
That's okay, sonny-boy...
...once you get Raveena,
there'll be lights all around.
Lights all around.
I'm exhausted...
This is the bed...
let's sleep now.
Your Amar has arrived, Raveena.
Prem really put me into trouble.
But it was your love which saved me.
There must be many donkeys
dreaming about you, Raveena.
But when you meet Prem ...
...you'll fall head over heels in love with him!
My love!
- What are you doing here?
- And what are you doing here?
I think the idiot's dead.
His spirit is roaming...
It must be your spirit.
- Get lost!
- You get lost!
- Go... get lost... damn you...
- Go... get lost... Oh mother!
Hey, Amar...
How are you?
- 'First Class'. How are you?
- 'Tip Top'!
- Y-O-U?!
- Y-O-U?!
- What are you doing here?
- How about you?
- I came here first!
- By conning me!
- You picked my pocket first!
- You did!
What did you say?!
What's going on?
Fighting and arson in my lodge?!
Not fighting!
This is affection!
We were separated in our childhood.
Which explains the affection!
Lots of love!
Why did you get separated?
It wasn't me... we were separated
in the fair held at Kumbh!
It was because he left my hand.
Why did you do that?
Come and embrace me, brother...
Never leave me now!
You've become very fat!
Naughty boy!
Make up for the lost years.
Your love and affection...
...reminds me of that episode of
Raman and Sagar's "Ramayan"...
...in which Lord Rama and Bharat were united.
Not two... take away one cup of tea...
...we'll share the tea.
It'll strengthen our friendship.
Keep it there!
What friendship?
To hell with it!
I'm telling you
Raveena's not for you.
You don't understand and instead get angry!
Be a good boy and return to Bhopal.
You're threatening me!
Do you see these muscles?
I'll crush you!
Flexing muscles, idiot?!
Raveena's mine! Hear that!
Yes.
She's your sister-in-law.
What are you fighting for?
The deserving person from the trio will get her.
- Who's the third?
- Who's the third, punk?
- I'm there, too.
- You?!
How dare you?!
How could you even imagine!
Just as you did!
That's enough.
I've got a nasty temper!
- And then? What will you do?
- I... I'll think...
There's no time to waste.
Do you think we're the only aspirants here?
Go there and take a look...
there are thousands there!
There's a big queue. Tokens are
being distributed for the interview.
I had to wait for 20 hours to even get a token!
Oh Mother! No. 717...
Raveena's in great demand!
It's disgusting...
...there's a limit to unemployment.
Youngsters ought to be ashamed!
One rich girl and everybody's
make a beeline for her!
Even though they lack in looks and talent!
You're one of us, too!
My case is different.
We'll have to do something to begin with.
We'll have to ruin the chances of all
those who have assembled here.
After that, the deserving person will get her.
The deserving will surely get her!
Okay.
Let's go.
Let's go...
I already have her.
You illiterate, ill-mannered, insolent donkey!
You dare ask us for our identity!
Introduce us, Mr. Dhamru!
This is the Nawab Noorali Nizamuddin
Barkatali, alias Bade Miyan.
And this is Ameerali, Ashleelali,
Asli, alias Chhote Miyan.
And I am Damru Tehmurlang Turk.
So many names?
Where are the rest of them?
They're their names.
- Who are you?
- I'm her Sr. Executive Manager.
- And I'm the Junior.
- They appear to be servants.
Their faces say it all.
- We can't see our little girl.
- I'm looking for her, too.
Who's the 'little one'?
Raveena Bajaj has a function here.
She's the 'little one'.
She used to play in my lap!
And I used to carry her on my shoulder!
- She used to call me 'Uncle'...
- And I was younger uncle...
Oh, so you're her uncle!
You've come at the right time.
Today she...
...she will choose her bridegroom.
- Bridegroom?
- There are many suitors here...
Because of which we
arranged the function here.
- Idiot! Where are the suitors?
- Over there!
Take me there...
Shame on them!
Look, there they are!
Hey young men!
Come here and listen to me!
Just forget the idea of
getting married to Raveena!
Because she was engaged
when she was a child!
To Prem Singh, that is!
- Go away all of you. Get lost!
- No!
We will not leave!
We will not go!
- Deal with them, Dhumro!
- As you wish, Sir!
Go and bring Raveena here!
Come on! Hurry up!
- Congratulations.
- To you, too.
There are two elderly gentlemen outside.
They claim that they've had
your father playing in their laps!
They also claim that you
used to call them 'Uncle'.
- Uncle?
- Recognize me? I'm your Uncle!
You're scaring the girl!
Come to me, dear...
...do you remember, dear?
We used to go for those walks?
Remember that sweet-meats shop?
Those sweets?
And also the zoo with all those animals...
Step aside!
Come and embrace your uncle!
Come dear, come to me!
She's embraced you enough
when she was a kid.
But I was her favorite!
My sweet, honey, darling!
He seems to be hungry!
Give him something to eat!
Oh no! I'm not hungry!
What are you looking back for, all the time?
The old man suffers fits of epilepsy!
And clings to anyone who comes before him!
Is that so? You have those sweets.
I'll go take a look.
Sweet-meats?!
They're nice indeed!
You're more beautiful than
any of your photographs!
Which is why I've fixed your
marriage with Amar Singh.
- Who's Amar Singh?
- Don't you know Amar Singh?!
- No.
- Amar Singh is the handsome youth...
...who makes girl swoon when
he walks through their streets!
- They really do.
- How can I believe you?
You ill-mannered wretch!
You doubt my words!
People still don't get married in
Aligarh without consulting me!
Not a single marriage!
That's my experience!
My hair hasn't turned gray out
of inexperience, you know!
There are many tales revolving
around me and my brother.
We've done everything since
the Independence of India.
So, you know Raveena
since she was a child, right?
Not only our darling Raveena,
I know her father too!
What else do you know?
When Raveena sat in my
lap, she just wouldn't get up!
She used to pester me for things
to eat and to roam around the city!
Which is why you even chose
the bridegroom for her, right?
What a boy! He's one in a million!
Prem Singh!
- But he said it was Amar Singh.
- The old man's getting senile!
Neither can he see nor hear properly!
What can we do for you?
Just tell me where the other old gentleman is.
He's gone to sleep.
I'm not feeling very good, too...
...I think I too will
lie down for sometime.
We've made all the
arrangements for you to lie down!
- Where's my cane?
- Cane? Here it is!
You should have let me know,
if your disguise had come off.
I too would have fled with you.
May even my enemies not
have friends like you are!
So, return to Bhopal.
This is simply not your ball-game.
What are two cups for?
Take away one!
We'll share the tea.
It'll strengthen our friendship.
Keep it there and scoot!
To hell with your friendship!
You always get me beaten up!
You think I'm a fool, eh?
- I...
- Freeze!
One punch and you'll break to pieces!
Only my back is broken...
Not my elbow!
- Threatening me with your elbow?
- No...
What are you fighting for?
There are only the two of you now.
I've already quit the race.
When were you in the race?
You can't be compared with me!
I was in the race, too!
But I forgot all about
romance, after seeing his fate.
I'm happy as I am. But I'll always
help you. Till I breathe my last!
Learn a thing or two from him!
Look how wise he's being!
Henceforth, you too start helping me, okay?
You'll see it, God will never forgive you!
Why don't you people take turns in trying?
That's a good idea!
I'll make the first attempt.
First get into the position of making an attempt!
You'll suffer the consequences of my curse!
- Have you seen the film 'Sholay'?
- Yes. At least 10 times!
- His father wrote it.
- Don't drag him into this!
In 'Sholay', Amitabh and Dharmendra
tossed a coin to decide everything.
You do that, too. The winner
will make the first attempt.
Yes!
Now, that's a good idea!
We'll leave it to the toss.
Winners are 'Conquerors'
losers are apes!
Now listen...
Heads I win, Tails you lose.
- Is that okay?
- No! Reverse that!
Okay...
Tails you lose, Heads I win.
Here goes the coin... and the winner...
Tails you lose,
Heads I win!
Here I come, Raveena!
If he wins Heads, you win Tails.
You haven't lost! You've won!
Oh yes!
I'm the conqueror!
But he's made an ape out of you!
My plan will take me straight
to the girl's bedroom!
- To the bedroom?
- Absolutely!
Once you reach the bedroom, it
won't take much to reach her heart.
- Oh no!
- But there's a problem.
- The stick.
- Stick?
The girl must be somehow
made to give me the stick.
- But why will she hit you?
- Because I'll worry her.
- So, you'll worry her, too?!
- Yes, a lot...
- But why?
- Because I want her to hit me.
Will you quietly get hit?
- With pleasure.
- Don't worry. I'll supply the stick.
- Really?
EROS
She's killed him!
Is anybody there?!
No! I haven't done this!
I saw you doing it!
It was your hand!
It was your club!
One hit and the poor chap died!
Listen to me!
The club kept coming before me...
...and he continued misbehaving.
I held myself from hitting him...
But you struck at last!
Listen! Please don't call the Police!
- Who else can I call?
- He's breathing! He'll get up.
How will the poor chap wake up?
It’ll take four people to haul him up now.
He's left the world for good!
He died at a young age!
No! Don't call the Police!
I'll get him cured!
Please give me a hand!
Where am I? Who am I?
Who are you people?
Where have I come from?
What's my name?
The poor chap's struck by amnesia!
All this happened because
of the blow you gave him!
Why do you keep scolding me?!
Why is she crying? What blow?
Which blow?
I can't understand anything.
Won't you people tell me?
You tell me! You'll have to!
What have you done, Raveena?
You too scold me?!
I won't speak to anyone!
I'll have to call the police now!
Don't call the police.
Please!
It was I who hit him,
I'll have him treated too.
Till he recovers his memory,
I'll keep him here. Care for him!
You're so nice...
So beautiful...
...how much you care for me.
What's your name, Miss Raveena?
It's necessary for you to recover soon.
- What's the hurry?
- Mr. Bajaj is arriving tomorrow.
I've made a mistake, sir...
I forgot to tell you.
Mr. Bajaj called from London
to say he's coming next week.
Father's funny too!
He's left us here all alone.
There's some problem everyday.
He's not bothered about us!
I think so, too.
He doesn't care for you.
What kind of a father is he?
He should've been here. With you.
Just think; two girls, poor things,
all alone in a strange city...
Robert, dial his number.
I'll talk to him.
Who am I?
Where am I?
Who is this?
You seemed to be pretty
decent in your younger days.
You were fooled, weren't you?
That's the game!
He's my brother, my twin-brother.
Mr. Ramgopal Bajaj.
My name's not Teja... it's Shyamgopal Bajaj.
He was my father's pet.
My old man used to love him a lot.
I wonder what spell he had them under...
...but he was always considered to
be Lord Rama and I was Ravana.
I decided then that I'd knock off
my father and clear his cards, too.
And I gave it a good try.
As it happened, our clerk,
Harishankar, spilled the beans.
But it was good. He used to bore
me with a lot of holy mumbo-jumbo.
I was sentenced to 10 years
of imprisonment in that case.
I was in jail for 10 years!
When I came out, the
whole scene had changed.
He had gone away to London
and multiplied his 1 crore to 30!
But sir, why didn't you go to London, too?
How could I go to London?
The police is on my trail.
Mogambo's nephew is hunting
me for the 5 lakhs I swindled.
Don't I want to see London?
But how could I go?
But now the bad days are behind us.
That girl is his daughter!
Let him enter my domain just once...
...I will not be defeated
like Ravana was!
I'll 'lay out' all his cards!
A profit of millions for only one murder?!
Leave that to me, Mr. Teja.
I'll kill him in a manner he
won't even realize he's dead.
But you will kill him only when
he comes to India, won't you?
But when will he come to India?
When will he?
His daughter's here, sir.
He'll certainly come, too!
Good!
That's very good!
Kill his daughter then!
- Who's that? Miss Raveena?
- What's it, Tilu?
When I got up this morning,
I saw that I had lost my eye-sight.
Where are we, by the way?
The world seemed strange
when I lost my memory...
...and now it's turning dark,
when I've lost my eye-sight.
Get a grip on yourself, Tilu.
Control, my foot!
Excuse me... step aside!
Leave me! Leave me!
- No!
- Let me go!
I have right to live!
- What's going on here?
- He's committing suicide.
Oh?!
There's someone to see you, Madam.
Let go of me!
Let me go, I said!
Oh God!
- Who are you?
- What is it?
Please don't worry.
I'm a Police Doctor.
Just as the police smells out the criminals...
...I reach the patients with the scent I get, too.
Old?
Khurana... not Purana ...
Dr Prem Khurana!
I have information that there's
a patient hiding in your house.
I didn't do it deliberately...
I was only standing with the club...
I know that!
But where is he?
How should we have known
that he'd lose his memory?
Tilu's eye-sight is failing him, too.
- Tilu?
- Yes, we found him at the Lake...
...so we call him Tilu.
He'll see everything clearly
when he catches sight of me!
Hasn't he recognized me?!
- Will he get back his memory then?
- Of the last seven births!
- I know this ailment well.
- Who's he, Miss Raveena?
He's a doctor.
I'm a pretty old hand.
He seems more like a carpenter!
- My father was a carpenter.
- I don't want him treating me.
Give me poison instead.
I'd rather die.
I'll fulfill that wish too.
Leave her hand.
- No.
- Let go of her hand!
He has a contagious disease!
Everything will be okay, now that I've come.
The name's Prem...
Prem Khurana.
See how I set him right now.
Our friendship?! Have you forgotten?
I'm your friend, after all!
- To hell with it!
- I feel like strangling you!
I'll give you an injection meant
for horses. You'll neigh, too!
What are you discussing with him?
- That's very confidential.
- Confidential?
Distractions! Tilu!
The treatment!
What's all this?
You can understand this, Miss.
I don't want my memory.
I'll manage with what little I have.
This is a disease which spreads at his touch!
To treat him, you must
keep him away from food.
Will he recover his memory if
he's hit on the same spot again?
- That's possible.
- Oh no!
Can we give him another blow then?
He must be hit on the same spot.
A hard blow!
I'll hit him! I'll succeed if
I give him two or four blows!
I've had it!
You hit him earlier, Miss Raveena.
Let me try now.
You're going to get a sound thrashing!
Leave this to me.
Only tell me when and how
many blows he must be given.
Can I try, sir?
Two and two...
Four in all!
Everybody will be given a fair chance.
Give him two blows, when he gets up.
Keep giving him two blows, as
and when he wants to sleep.
I get up before everybody else does, sir.
There's nothing to worry about, is there Doctor?
I've given him the injection.
He needs blessings and blows now.
Don't forget to keep hitting him.
Till he recovers,
I'll stay here.
- An unwanted guest?
- That's how I am.
Accommodate him in the outhouse, Robert.
Not there; In this house, near your room.
- Give me the room opposite mine.
- Is there nothing adjoining?
- There is. Near mine.
- Opposite will do. Thanks.
The doctor's very nice. Isn't he?
Gone crazy over him, have you?
Hurry up...
We've to give Tilu some blows.
- This is a unique bouquet, Robert.
- It's beautiful, sir.
- I've kept a time-bomb in it.
- You hold it.
It's time for Raveena to come out.
When she smilingly picks it up,
it'll blast at the appointed time.
And that will be the
last 'time' of her life.
It's time for you to keep the bouquet.
But if I keep it, the police will...
Don't worry, Robert.
I've written Tilu's name on it.
Tilu will go to prison, and Raveena to heaven.
It's like killing two people using the same arrow!
It's like killing two, with one arrow.
Go now. There's very little
time in the time-bomb left.
Have you switched it on?!
- Is the car ready, Robert?
- No! Yes... it is!
No!
I've kept the time-bomb on the table, sir.
Raveena will be out soon.
Good-timing is okay, but
when will good times come?
Good times will be upon us very soon...
What's that?
Flowers?!
For Raveena? From Tilu?!
You dare do this!
I'll put my name there...
What's going on, Doctor?
Who are you giving the bouquet to?
And what's this behind you?
What are you hiding?
For Raveena, is it?
...Tilu!
Your name instead of mine, eh?
Don't mess with me...
Mr. Tilu!
Who's Tilu?
I'll give you a kick!
What's up?
What's happening, Tilu?
I brought you flowers, but the
doctor wants to beat me up!
- Well, doctor?
- I brought the flowers!
- I brought them!
- I did!
- I brought them!
- I did!
Start counting, Robert.
Have the good times arrived?
- You threw it!
- You did!
What you mean to say is that...
...you couldn't play the 'game'
because of those two clowns.
Very good.
I've got great satisfaction.
Sorry, sir.
We made a mistake my oversight.
Those two boys are very smart, sir.
At breakfast yesterday...
Please don't worry, Mr. Teja.
A snoring rat can't awaken a lion, can it?
- According to our new plan...
- Shut up!
You and your 'plans'!
I'm going through a bad patch!
They speak like lions and are
not even rats themselves!
I don't want any excuses this time.
Do anything, but finish the 'game'.
And this time, come here
with the news of their death!
I'll come with the corpse, if you wish.
Or better still, I'll kill her here in your presence.
We've very smartly managed to
discover something more, Sir.
Mr. Bajaj of London has converted
all his wealth into diamonds.
He'll arrive here in 10 days.
We heard that when he was talking
to his daughter over the phone.
- What did boss say?
- I couldn't hear him.
But he definitely must have said 'smart boy'!
Will I get food today,
Miss Raveena?
- Yes, you will.
- Really?
Certainly.
- Has the doctor left?
- Forget him and eat. Okay?
So much of food?!
For me?!
Careful!
Who hit me?
All that food is for us.
And this food is for you.
Pepper-balls, ginger sweets...
...bitter gourd soup and chilies-salad.
I think I'm recovering my memory!
- Anything else?
- No.
Your treatment continues then.
Eat it, Tilu.
You'll recover soon.
Eat it as if it were medicine.
The doctor himself made it.
I'd rather die than eat this!
How can you die like this, Tilu?
We won't let you die so easily, after all.
Feed him with your hands, Miss.
He'll have to eat then...
Else, it'll break her heart.
Eat this...
You're very smart, doctor.
Who's all that food for, Robert?
It's for the doctor, sir.
- Is it something special?
- Yes. Especially for him.
With lots of butter and clarified butter.
I can't hope for all this.
Could you get my medicines from
upstairs? I'll live on them now.
- I'll get it, sir.
- Hurry.
Pepper-balls for me and
mutton-soup for you, eh?!
Here's purgative meant for horses.
It really knocks them out!
- You'll crave for food!
- Is dinner served, Robert?
Does it have enough of butter, Robert?
This is delicious...
Is anything left?
No...
The food was excellent today.
- Where's Miss Raveena, Robert?
- Upstairs.
"For the very first time, I've seen
Love in my beloved's eyes"
"Now is when my heart is contented, too"
It's you?
Please come, doctor.
- Stop calling me doctor.
- Well?
You can call me Prem.
Have some oranges.
- I want to say something to you.
- Yes?
Actually, this has to do with the heart.
Yes...
From quite some time now...
Go on.
- Yes?
- Give me two minutes.
- Please come, doctor.
- I asked you not to call me doctor.
- Call me Prem.
- Have some oranges.
