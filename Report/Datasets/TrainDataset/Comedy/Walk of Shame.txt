Thank you so much
for coming with me.
You're my girl.
Team.
Right. Team.
They're not going to bring up
the cat thing, right?
That was 100 years ago.
No one looks at those
YouTube things anymore.
Yeah, right.
Relax, Meghan.
Relax?
Ooh. It's the network.
It's a big step up from local,
but you are ready.
Oh, I'm ready.
Just be yourself.
No, I'm going to be exactly
what they want me to be.
"Anchor."
It is both a noun and a verb.
A reliable or principal support,
but in action,
it means to hold fast.
Hmm.
Mmm.
I believe I can do that
for your viewers...
be the center,
and hold them... steady.
Tell us more about yourself.
Well, I was raised in Texas.
I studied journalism
at the University of Texas.
I love to read.
I'm a voracious reader.
Mostly historical fiction.
Have you read
Toni Morrison's
- Of course.
- Good answer.
My role models
include my parents,
which I know is corny,
but they've
been married 35 years...
and, um, I am recently engaged.
We like that.
We'll have a decision
in two weeks.
There isn't any...
dirt in your past
that we should know about?
Skeletons?
Bones of any kind?
I'm a good girl.
Morning, Meghan Miles.
Be well.
Good day. Good day.
Hey, looking good,
Chuck Rogers.
Five minutes to air, people.
I just spoke to my source
inside the network.
And?
Its down to you
and Wendy Chang.
The decision
should come down today.
Don't be nervous.
Don't be nervous?
You shouldn't have told me.
Breathe.
Oh, gosh, hang on.
This is Meghan Miles.
Meghan, you dirty hooker.
Rosie, stop.
I'm about to go on air.
But be advised that we
are going out tonight
to celebrate.
Honey, I didn't get the job yet.
- Minor detail.
- I don't know.
It's been a really long week.
Repeat after me:
"I will not block the cock."
You know what? Hang on.
I have another call.
It could be the network.
This is Meghan Miles.
- Hey, Mama.
- We just saw
your last newscast.
Although that outfit
was a little revealing
by about a button.
Really?
I've been telling wardrobe
to watch out for it.
Thank you for the feedback.
Say hi to Kyle.
Talk soon.
Fine. I will not block
the cock.
- Still me, hon.
-
I'm so sorry, Mama.
This is KZLA
- With Jane Rain, weather.
- Camera one.
Ready, Chuck?
Let's do this.
Chuck Rogers, sports.
And Chopper Steve, traffic.
Will you stop it?
My mother's gonna kill me.
steer clear.
steer clear.
And we're clear.
Great.
Chopper Steve...
Is he on his meds?
Short answer, no.
Did anybody call?
Did you get any e-mails?
No. No. Calm down.
Any text messages
I need to know about?
Calm down.
I'm going to hear
from them,
and I'll call you at home.
I can't wait
to get my drink on.
And get my dance on.
And...
Just those two things.
Denise.
What?
Meghan.
Meghan! Meghan Miles.
Either she's not home
or she's ignoring us.
Or she's incapacitated,
tied up...
or maybe she had a stroke
or a seizure or something.
Denise, this is Brentwood.
Nothing bad
ever happens in Brent...
Oh, my God, O.J. Simpson.
I just remembered that.
Yeah.
Meghan!
It's open.
Honey, you are not back
on the farm in Texas.
You cannot just
leave your door unlocked.
Hey, party girls.
What's up?
What do you want to drink?
I have tap water.
Wait.
Wait, what's going on?
Where's Kyle?
He's at the supermarket.
And, um, where's all your stuff?
Oh. Um...
Kyle took it all
to the supermarket.
The
He's gone.
He, um...
He said he didn't know
who I was anymore,
and then he left
and he took everything.
That's so weird.
When is he coming back?
Why did you not tell us?
I don't know.
I'm sorry.
Rosie, I just...
Yeah, but, honey,
we're your friends.
We're not gonna judge you.
Hang on. It's Dan.
Chang!
This is such a terrible time
for Kyle to not be here.
Denise, shut up.
They gave it to Wendy Chang.
She's an anchor
in San Francisco.
There you go, honey.
That's a diversity hire.
Asian. What can you do
about that?
She's not even Asian.
She's adopted.
She has red fucking hair.
I'm sorry. That was mean.
Good for her.
No.
Screw Chang.
You are the best.
Yeah. No one reads
the news like you, Meghan.
We're going to sit down
and come up with a plan
to fix your life.
Okay, guys, no more
pity party. It's fine.
So go. I'll be fine.
I'm just gonna stay here
and catch up on
No! We're not gonna
leave you here.
You don't even have your dog.
Technically, it was Kyle's dog.
Who cares? Forget it.
Get a cat.
Ew. That's gross.
Cats hate me. You know that.
People say cats are clean,
but they're really filthy.
I am sorry, okay?
Whatever.
You're gonna meet
some young, stupid, hot guy,
and you're gonna take all
your anger and your aggression
out on his penis.
I don't know.
I don't do that with penises.
I'm more of
a relationship type of girl.
We're taking you out.
Come on. Let's go.
Fine, but I'm wearing
these sweatpants.
No. You're gonna wear
something slutty,
like Denise.
I don't own anything
slutty like Denise.
Denise, give Meghan your dress.
- But...
- No buts.
You can wear
one of her pantsuits.
Ew.
Ew.
Why is it so loud in here?
Isn't it great?
This is what you need.
Shots time.
Already?
Yup, that's right.
Throw it back.
Unless you're too soft.
Yeah.
Whoa, whoo!
Yeah, the other two were for us.
I guess we're gonna need
three more.
This is good.
Three more. Three more.
How about
something different?
To match your dress.
Thanks.
Fancy.
Looking at us?
Oh, my God.
What do you do?
Act bitchy?
Yeah. Bitchy.
Boo.
Ooh.
Sunshine.
You want to join me
and my boys
for some drinks?
Will the drinks be alcoholic?
More tequila?
That's what that is.
Wow, your friend's
quite the party girl, huh?
Tonight she is.
Let's make a toast
to these girls, huh, boys?
Yes. My dad made a toast
at my fifth grade graduation,
- and I kept it in my memory...
- Keep it there.
Cheers!
I love my daddy.
Kyle sucks.
Can I just get
one of these buckets?
Thank you so much.
Excuse me.
Go get a cab.
Let's get rid of this.
All good.
Let's rally. Let's rally!
You want to get out of here?
Absolutely.
You stay here.
No, no.
Where are you going?
I got to go for a wee-wee.
Excuse me.
Oh.
Oh. This is high.
Uh... Hello?
There's no handle.
Hello?
Hi.
Oh, hi.
Whatcha you doing up there?
I'm just looking
for the bathroom.
Are you stuck?
How dare you, sir.
Don't you know it is rude
to ask if a lady is stuck?
Oh.
Yes, I am stuck.
And I'm a little drunk.
I should tell you that.
All right.
Nothing wrong with that.
Stay stuck for a second.
Whoa!
That won't be hard.
I can't move.
Breaking news, 2:00 a.m.
Girl stuck on balcony.
Hi.
Hi.
- Huh. Oh!
- What do you think?
Wow. This is a mess.
Bit of a situation.
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.
If we could just find a way
to get this shoe off.
What a puzzle.
All right.
Well, we got a strap
coming around here.
Wait. Oh, my God!
What?
There's a whole other strap.
-
- Which one?
Left? Right?
You need to stay calm.
- What's your name?
- Meghan.
- Meghan, where you from?
- Texas.
Texas. I like Texas.
Hurry! The timer
is reading five seconds.
All right.
Stay with me, Meghan.
- Four, three, two...
- Here we go.
Aaah!
Are we alive?
I think so.
You're a hero.
Thank you.
Should we get down?
You can do it.
I'm right behind you.
Okay.
So, are you trying to escape?
French exit?
Yeah, I think I was.
I just sort of had my fill
of the lecherous males...
and the...
I don't know.
I don't really
do this very much,
and so I just felt
this wave of depression
coming over me...
Here.
and I thought
I should probably...
It's cold.
It is cold.
Anyway. Rosie.
What?
She says she's leaving.
I should get my car.
Um...
I should go.
Your car? No, no.
I don't think
you should be driving.
Why don't we get you a cab?
Let's find a cab
for you.
No, I really want my car.
You don't think I can drive?
Uh...
Come here.
Sobriety test.
Smell that meat.
Oh, my God.
That smells so good.
You're so drunk.
That's not even meat.
Screw you, cracker.
It's meat.
All right, why don't I
drive you home in your car,
and then I'll take a cab
home from there?
How about that?
No, you don't have
to leave work.
No, no. It's fine.
I'm not just a bartender.
I got other things
going on.
You got a day job?
I am a writer of books.
What kind of books?
Uh, sort of post-modern
romantic fiction.
That is my favorite genre.
Are you messing with me?
No. It's really cool.
I'm a journalist.
I've done some...
I don't know.
I don't write anything, really.
I thought I would,
but I mostly just read.
I read the news.
I don't know.
Anyway, so what does
a post-modern romantic writer
do all day?
Find beauty and praise it.
Wow.
That is the opposite
of what I do, I think.
All right, let's go.
I'm getting you home safe.
Where do you live?
Where do  live?
Okay, you're getting
on my level.
You like the dark stuff.
Okay, hands like this.
Shotgun poetry.
All right, get ready.
"Hark! 'Tis an elfin-storm
from faery land,
of haggard seeming,
but a boon indeed.
I have a home for thee."
I win!
Let's take our clothes off.
I'd like to go
to the judges on that one.
Okay. Judges?
Where are you, judges?
Okay. It's a girl.
All right. It's a girl.
Ooh! What is in there?
I only know two chords
Do you trust me?
Yeah, I do.
You trust me?
I do.
I don't. I don't.
No, no!
-
- Yes!
Oh, fuck.
Don't mess with Texas.
Dress down. Down.
Oh.
I'm hungry.
Okay. What is this?
What is this little table thing?
Put that one down
and get another one.
I want to do
This is the best.
Mmm. Mmm.
Mmm.
Let me see.
Don't be shy.
Yes!
Yellow's your color.
Oh, God.
Okay, where's my phone?
My purse. My phone.

Oh.
Ohhh.
No. I hate cats.
Don't you do anything.
Mmm. Mmm.
No, no, no.
No, no, no, no.
You were in the box.
Shoes, shoes, shoes.
Where's my...
Where are my keys?
I hate cats!
Okay.
Okay. All right.
Okay.
Where is my car?
Oh, wait. He drove.
We kissed,
and then I fumbled
for some Tic Tacs.
Oh, no.
There's no names.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait!
That's my car. Hey!
That's... That's my car.
That's my car.
That was my car.
Aaah! Don't shoot!
Don't shoot.
You sneak up, I shoot you.
No, no, no, no.
I just want a ride.
I'm just trying to hire you.
Oh, no, no, no.
Off duty. Off duty.
No, please, sir.
I will pay you...
Double. Triple.
To take me to the tow place.
Mm-mmm.
Do you know where that is,
the place they tow to?
Oh. Tow to?
Yes! Yes, you understand.
The tow to.
Tow to.
Okay, great.
Thank God.

Yes, I work.
Very important

Tonight. Okay.

So, here we go.

You know, I like it, your work.
You know my work?
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Very nice.
Oh, well, thank you.
Thank you so much.
Yeah, I love what I do.
It gives me a lot
of self-worth and really...
I don't know. I...
You have boyfriend?
Um, presently,
I do not technically have a man.
I mean, I just...
I don't know.
I met someone, and...
Oh, but I just left someone.
I didn't...
Well, truth be told,
he left me.
Actually, I don't
really give a shit.
Okay. Good talk.
Ah!
Here.
Here? Where here?
-
- Here. Tow to.
No, no.
Oh, my goodness.
No, no, no.
This is Tattoo,
and I said "tow to"
as in "tow your car."
This is a funny
language miscommunication.
I can't get out here
because I don't nave my money.
It's in my purse,
which is in my car.
Which is at the
to place. Tow to.
You no pay, I drive you jail.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
We don't... There's no jail.
Then you pay $23.
I am not a stripper.
I'm actually a journalist...
with local Emmy nominations
and a lot of connections,
so you will get paid.
You will get your money.
But right now, I really,
really need you to just
help me out, okay?
Do you understand?
Okay.
Okay.
You give me
a dance on lap. Huh?
Four song.
Dance on lap, $23.

Yes.

Okay!
You dance on lap

Bullshit for me.
Good deal. Yeah?
Two songs.
Okay. Two song.
Alanis Morissette

The... Sure. The V.I.P. room.
Just unlock the door.
Yeah. Okay.

You can't take a gun in there.
Oh, no gun. No gun.
I get lap ready.
Come on. We...
Hey!

Come on back!
We had deal.

Son of a bitch.
This is nuts.

Wait. You can help me.
Hang on. You can...

You could help... Hey!
Oh. Hey, hey. Hey, hi.
Hey.
Hi.
Hi.

I could really use
some help.
Yeah, I could use
some help too.
Oh, really? With what?
Oh, no.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
No.
I'm not a...
I'm not a hooker.
Yeah, okay.
Have a good night.
No, no, no, no.
Wait. You can't...
Oh! That's disgusting.
Oh, God.
This stupid dress.
I am gonna murder Denise.
Oh, my God, I'm...
freezing.
-
Hey!
-
Who the fuck are you?
Uh, I'm not a prostitute.
Excuse me?
Check out Barbie over here.
Where did you guys
come from?
Go on.
Hey, hey. Excuse me.
Is there any chance that you
are not looking for a hooker?
Free agent?
Get out of here.
Looks like it.
It's ballsy.
Gotta give it to her, man.
That takes a lot of balls.
Oh, no, come on, Dave.
Man, it's the end
of our shift.
Look, dude,
I just gotta get home,
get a little bit of rest.
I was gonna drive
down to Long Beach.
Got this whole
fishing-charter thing
set up.
It's our job, Walter.
No, it isn't.
Our job is to keep
the hookers over there,
away from the
decent people down there.
All right.
All right, look.
We can issue her
an official warning,
but if I see her out here
again, we gotta take her in.
See? That's good police work.
That's what I'm talking about.
- What's the matter,
you can't hear?
- I have nothing against...
uh, modern...
female entrepreneurs.
Oh, shit.
Thank God. Oh, hallelujah!
of not approaching the vehicle.
I... Okay.
I can't see now.
Thank goodness you are here.
I am so happy to see you.
You deaf?
This has been the longest
night of my life.
Quit your babbling.
This has been the...
Quit your babbling and listen.
Okay.
We have you on video
soliciting those cars.
What...
We can haul you in
right now.
No, no, no, no.
I was not soliciting sex.
Ma'am, do not
raise your voice at me.
Don't you raise
your voice at him!
How much you had
to drink tonight?
- Uh...
- You smell like a distillery.
I just...
I haven't been home.
Neither have I.
Which is why we're gonna give
you a break and let you off
with a warning.
Ready? Here it is.
Stay off of my streets.
- But-But...
- We see you out here again,
and you will go to jail.
But I didn't do anything wrong.
Really?
You haven't done
anything wrong?
What, are you going out
to get some eggs?
Just wrapping up
your paper route?
It's time to grow up.
- Now stay off my streets.
- Stay off his streets.
- I can...
- Sit down and think about it.
Think about it.
Sit down.
Don't be on your knees.
Off his streets
and grow the fuck up, okay?
You're not going to help me?
Aren't you supposed
to help people?
I... I'm not a...
Bitch, get outta here.
That sounded tough. Veteran.
Oh, thank you.
Yeah, we did the right thing.
You better start running!
Okay. I'm going.
I'm running. I'm running.
I'm running.
Molly?
Me... Mel...
Meghan.
Meghan?
Meghan?
I'm just calling to make sure
that you got home okay,
'cause things got
a little fuzzy last night.
Hey, babe.
What...
What are you doing here?
I like to get up early.
Of course you do.
You're like 70.
Just to clarify,
what happened last night?
Everything.
Everything?
- And by everything,
you mean...
- Everything.
- I just passed out...
- Everything but that.
Listen, you got a banana
or something?
I'm sorry.
This was a mistake.
I thought I was taking home
a really young, very cute guy.
You must mean my son.
Yeah, we get confused
all the time.
Don't worry about it.
Crazy night.
You can party.
Fuck.
Yeah. What you
think I'm doing?
I'm on the corner.
Yeah. Hold up.
Hold up. Hold up.
What's up?
All right, cool.
Follow that guy down there.
Yeah, baby, what's up?
Sometimes I wonder.
They like the fuckin'
Keystone Kops out there.
All right, later.
Sneaking up on me
is a bad idea.
No, no, no.
Hi. I'm not sneaking up.
I wasn't. I just...
No samples.
Keep your zombie ass moving.
I-I just need a little help.
Sir.
Now, I know you can see
I'm working,
and I'm sure you done
worked that ass
enough tonight.
You need
to get on home.
That's all I want to do.
And I don't want your drugs.
Excuse me?
Oh. I mean... That was
a terrible assumption.
I mean, I don't know
if there's...
I wouldn't...
Yeah, you don't know.
You're right.
You need to forget
what you think I'm doing.
It's already forgotten.
I'm so sorry about that.
Um, I just want
to borrow your phone.
Can I please make a call
on your phone?
I'm pretty sure today might
be the most important day
of my life,
but I really need
to make a call.
Please, I'm...
I am not what you think I am.
I swear.
I'm a good girl.
-
-
Oh, shit.
You ain't that good.
The police said
if they find me again
they're gonna arrest me.
For what?
Being a good girl?
It was a misunderstanding...
at worst.
Five-0! Five-O!
Full team's coming.
Oh. You better get lost.
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
What the fuck are you doing?
I'm getting lost.
Get lost somewhere else.
Where?
I don't know.
That's why they
call that shit lost.
Bitch, why are you so fast?
I ran track in high school.
Hang on. Hey.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Hang on. Hey!
Fuckin' yellow-ass Terminator.
I've gotta go home.
What are you
still doing behind me?
- Get out of here, man!
- I need to get in here.
Get off me.
Get away from me, bitch.
Oh, my God.
What are you doing?
Just give me the phone.
You better go back out.
Go back out.
I can't go out there.
Go.
I can't go out there.
I can't. I can't
be caught out there.
Oh.
What the fuck
are you doing in here?
I was one of the ones
runnin' from the Five-O.
- Who the fuck are you?
- Yo, chill. Chill, chill.
- She with me.
- Yeah. I'm with him.
Yeah.
Just some dumb ho.
You fuckin' stupid?
Look at this bitch.
She a undercover cop
wearing what looks like
a Marc Jacobs dress.
You think some raggedy-ass
trick get her hands on that?
Hold the fuck up.
How the fuck
you know what a fuckin'
Marc "Jenkins" dress is?
Watch one episode
of
and get back to me.
- Bitch is a cop.
- Man, she a trick.
- Cop.
- She's a trick.
No! That's the bitch
from the news.
What?
Why you let Pookie
up in here?
Why you let
some cop up in here?
Look, she ain't no cop.
That's the bitch from the news.
Channel Six
I'm about to put my foot up
in your motherfucking mouth.
I-I'm not a cop.
I'm not.
I am...
I'm bitch from the news.
"For KZLA
I'm Meghan Miles.
Be well."
Pookie, shut the hell up.
Why the hell would
KZLA's Meghan Miles...
be sucking dick
for crack in our hood?
No, I'm not
sucking dick for crack.
What you sucking dick for then?
Nothing.
- Shit's free?
- Uh...
So, you ain't sucked
one dick tonight?
Yeah, that's what I thought.
Okay, but it's...
That's not, uh...
Look, I'm just lost.
And I just need
to make a phone call.
- I just wanted
to borrow your phone.
- Look, right here. Look.
- Oh, my God.
- Bitch from the news.
Yeah.
Look at this.
"Be well." I love it.
Oh, shit.
It do kind of look like you.
Yeah. I'm Meghan.
Meghan Miles.
Look, bitch from the news,
you real good and stuff,
but I just think
you need to work on inviting
the audience in a little more.
Earnin' they trust.
You have a natural,
approachable beauty.
I like it.
But your delivery
is just a little robotic.
I just feel like
you can show us
a little more warmth.
- I know it's in there.
- Pookie, what
you smoking on?
Weed laced with embalming fluid.
It's pretty good.
No, no, no. I kind of see
what he's sayin'.
Uh-huh.
See, it's like you closed
to the world.
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah.
I mean, look how you holding
your shoulders right now.
Mm-hmm.
All closed off...
like you don't trust us.
Okay, these are, uh,
excellent points.
Viewer feedback
is very important
to me, Mr., uh...
- Hulk.
- Hulk.
- And?
- Scrilla.
Scrilla and Pookie.
- With two O's.
- Okay.
I'm gonna take
everything you said...
I'm going to take it all
under consideration.
I need to get back
to do the news.
Tonight, live at 5:00.
I'm up for a promotion,
so it's really important
that I be there.
But I am lost,
and I don't have a phone
or money,
and my car's in the impound lot.
And I am currently
standing in the middle
of a ghetto crack house.
Sorry. No offense.
- None taken.
- That's a pretty fair
description.
Look, I'll tell you what.
I'm going to help you out.
- Yeah. Exactly.
- Give her that one.
Use that one.
Okay.
Thank you.
You got it.
- Thank you.
- Right over there.
Okay.
Give me that.
What happened to that dress?
Since when you watch the news?
I wake up at 5:00.
That's what I...
You got a TV?
You see the TV in the back.
You need to sell that shit.
You owe me money.
I already paid you.
Remember my E.B.T. card?
Shut the hell up.
What's wrong, sweetheart?
I don't know anybody's number.
They were all in my phone.
I use the voice dialing
in my car,
and everyone's on speed dial.
That's some modern-day,
fucked-up shit, huh?
Yeah.
I only know,
like, three numbers.
My parents in Texas,
and I am  calling them.
I know my own number
so I could give it out
to people.
I'll just...
I should text myself, right?
Someone might get it.
That's a good idea.
Okay. "It's Meghan.
Help. I'm"...
- Where am I?
- The hood.
We more like hood-adjacent.
Hood. Yeah.
So what's the other number?
Who is this?
Goddamn it,
I said who is this?
Just talk.
It's me. It's Meghan.
You were never gonna call me.
I had to call you, okay, Kyle?
I had to.
Breaking up
was the hardest thing
I ever did.
Hang on.
Why are you talking so low?
Are you...
Are you with someone?
Is someone there
with you
- Are you drunk?
- Technically, probably yes.
-
- Is this a booty call?
No! I don't want
to have sex with you.
Damn! Who you
talking to?
It's my ex-fiancé.
Oh, okay.
All right.
- Who's that?
- That is Pookie.
He's an acquaintance of mine.
Okay, so then you
are not alone either.
What are you doing?
Why are you calling me?
I called you
because I'm in trouble,
Kyle, okay?
I need you to come and get me,
and I only knew
three numbers, okay?
You and my parents
and 1-800-FLOWERS,
and I wish to God
it wasn't the case,
but some things just stick,
you know?
I can't get rid of you.
Anybody know any numbers?
I don't know.
I know the bail bond's number.
800-588-2300
What you gonna
need that for?
Empire
I may need some carpet
or something.
- Are you in jail?
- Not yet, but it's
a distinct possibility.
Sober up.
Call a taxi, all right?
I gotta go.
Kyle, who are you talking to?
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God,
there  someone there!
I'm sorry.
Baby, can you please
come help me?
- Listen...
- Gotta...
Now you listen, motherfucker.
I don't know
what the fuck you did
to Meghan Miles...
from the motherfuckin' news,
but you better drag
your cracker-ass
out of bed...
And get down to this crack
house and get Meghan Miles
the fuck out of here.
She gotta go
do the motherfuckin' news,
or else she won't get
her fuckin' promotion.
You show one more
motherfuckin' ounce
of disrespect to this woman,
and I swear I will
track your bitch ass down
and set your ass on fire.
You hear me?
Now I got your number
in my phone,
but say something else.
That's good.
That was so sweet.
Really. Thank you.
I got you.
Uh, who's
That's Scrilla and Hulk.
They are also
acquaintances of mine.
Are you in a crack house?
That is what I am
trying to tell you.
I am in a crack house.
-
- Oh, shit!
Die slow, motherfucker!
Is this a joke, Meghan?
What the fuck is happening?
Meghan Miles from the news,
you gotta go now.
Go through that door,
make a right.
Go down the steps.
You'll see a vent.
Jump in it.
It'll take you out the back.
Go! Go!
You got this, right?
Wait up, bitch from the news.
I'm gonna put
some caps in your ass!
Why is this happening to me?
Right down here.
Who the fuck
are you, motherfuckers?
Ooh! Oh!
Aaah!
Oh. My bad.
Pookie?
Yeah, it's me.
Okay.
Come on, to the right.
Come on.
Okay.
Now go to the right.
This way, Meghan Miles.
Who was that?
Why is that happening?
I don't know.
That was insane.
I don't want to get shot.
I was just out
having a good time.
Come on.
You believe this?
Maybe it's some
other white chick
in a yellow dress.
Hey, hey, hey. Whoa.
You saw this lady?
- You gotta talk
to the lieutenant.
- No, we don't.
Yeah, you do.
Actually, we do.
I know we do.
You're just supposed
to say we don't.
Aw, shit.
Shit, shit.
Go!
Pookie?
Huh?
Do you know where
the impound lot is?
Where they tow cars to?
Uh...
The tow to.
You know where that is?
Is it nearby?
Yes, yes. Okay.
The impound lot.
Yeah.
What you want to do,
you wanna take this street
all the way down.
Hit Western.
Follow that like
it's your yellow brick road.
You gonna go under the 10.
If you hit Dollar Taco,
you gone too far.
Okay, so the Western
and the 10.
You're sure?
Yeah. Yeah, I'm about sure.
But look, don't use
the bathroom at Dollar Taco.
It's really bad.
Okay.
Don't do it.
Thank you.
Okay, you be good.
Wait, wait, wait!
What?
Oh, no, no.
No, I...
No. Take this.
Pookie, I can't take your crack.
It's worth about $10
on the street.
But don't smoke it.
It normally doesn't end well,
at least for me.
Pookie, I cannot
take your crack.
No. No, no.
I insist. Please.
When a crackhead
gives you his crack,
you have his heart right there.
Just remember,
shout out your boy Pookie
next time you're on air, okay?
Um, okay.
And don't forget to
shout out Scrilla and Hulk...
Yup.
And Skip, Skip-a-doo,
Treezy, B-Bow...
not to be confused
with G-Bow...
- Little Markeese
and also my Uncle Joseph.
- Sure.
He's locked down in Chino.
Okay.
- Oh, and Meghan Miles?
- Yeah?
Be well.
Be well too.
I'll be well if I get
my ass out of here.
For two years, there's been
a tenuous peace...
Then, all of a sudden,
some mystery white woman in
a yellow dress shows up...
and everything goes to shit.
I know. It's crazy.
Add to that,
she jacks a cabdriver.
Now she's running
with Scrilla's gang.
No, no, no, no.
She's just a hooker.
We saw her at the Point.
Yeah.
- And you didn't bring her in?
- I wanted to.
Tell you what, Lieutenant,
How about we just brief
the next shift coming in...
Next shift?
Ain't no next shift for you.
You two can I.D. her.
You're staying on
till we bring her in.
Caucasian, yellow dress, hooker.
Back to the streets, fellas.
Sorry.
What's wrong with you?
"I wanted to."
Protect and serve.
Go fuck yourself, Vic.
"It's Meghan. Help.
Lost in the Hood."
Oh, hey. This is...
I'm looking for Meghan.
Oh! Ooh.
Oh. Sorry.
I didn't see you there.
Ugh. Okay.
Hey! You're Meghan Miles,
that Channel Six news lady.
What are you doing
down here?
It's a long story.
You don't have five dollars,
do you?
- In the store, I do.
Can you wait right here?
- Sure.
For five dollars,
let me take your photo
and I'll put it on the wall.
Oh. No, no. I can't...
And then I put it
on Facebook
and everyone likes it.
No, no. Oh, no, no.
You can't put a photo
on Facebook.
No, no photos.
I'll send you a head shot.
I'll send you something.
Hey, look!
Meghan Miles
on the walk of shame.
Uh, Meghan's phone.
Who's this?
Where's Meghan?
Well, where is she now?
Why do you have her phone?
Did you hurt her?
No. No, I...
We went home together
last night,
and I'm thinking
she might be in some
trouble right now.
She left her phone here,
and I have no idea
where she is.
You better be telling
the truth, psycho,
because I will out-psycho you.
And if you hurt Meghan,
I will reign fucking fury down
on you.
- Where the fuck is that?
- It's downtown
near the Sixth Street bridge.
People live there?
Buzz 810 when you get here.
All right, well, you stay
there or I'm calling the cops.
-
-
-
- I'm up.
- I can hear
your sound machine.
- I need to just lie here.
It's bad.
It's really bad.
Denise, just get up.
Meghan might be in trouble.
She needs us.
Hey, babe, is everything cool?
Please don't touch me.
Who is that?
I think I may have
taken Iggy Pop home.
All right, all right.
What's up? What's up?
There you go.
Mm-hmm.
What the fuck is this?
Hi.
All right.
Hey, I don't wanna
waste anyone's time.
I'm gonna assume that
you're a crack dealer.
And, um, I was wondering
if you wanted
a little more.
A little more what?
A little more crack.
You know, like, maybe
I could cash it in
for some money.
You wanna sell me crack?
Well, I technically
don't wanna sell it because
I think that that's wrong.
But I was hoping
that maybe make a return
or something.
Oh. Okay. A return.
Yeah.
You got the receipt?
The...
Uh...
Or maybe the box
it came in?
Oh, come on, man,
I just have the crack.
Oh, you just got the crack?
Yeah, that's all I have.
And I just thought,
you know, you could
add it to your stash,
Uh-huh.
Give me, like, 10 bucks,
and then you can
sell it for more,
and that's good business.
You don't walk
into McDonald's
with your own hamburgers...
and try to sell it to 'em.
You know why?
Because they already got
their own hamburgers.
They're not gonna look
at your hamburgers
and be like, "Oh, shit.
She's got hamburgers.
That looks like a good deal.
Maybe I could buy 'em,
turn around and sell 'em
for twice as much."
Crack is
all the same, right?
It's just this little thing.
Put that shit away.
What the fuck you doing,
trying to set me up?
I'm saying that it
would be very easy to
pass off as your own crack.
It's probably all
from the same place,
isn't it?
I technically got it
from Pookie who, I'm sure,
got it from Scrilla.
Scrilla?
Yeah, yeah.
It's his crack.
You wanna unload
Scrilla's shit on my corner,
pass it off as my own?
You got a death wish, lady?
Yo, Ladeke!
What?
Who's Ladeke?
Deal with this shit.
School this bitch right now.
You're in the wrong territory.
This is the Figueroa Crew,
man.
I'm going.
- No, no, no, no, no.
- I'm not done with you.
- I'm getting on the bus.
- Come back here, man.
You wanna disrespect me?
Yo, Ladeke,
what am I, a sparrow?
When I whistle,
you got to respond!
You can't be behind the line.
This one?
There's two sides.
Is this the side?
You on the wrong side.
Okay, okay, great.
$1.50.
You, blondie.
Uh, yes. Yes.
$1.50.
Such a good
round... number.
- Where's your money?
- Oh, it's, uh...
You know what?
You can just keep going.
It's, um...
It's here somewhere.
It's, um...
Shame.
Are... Are you
talking to me?
Have you no shame?
I don't know
who you think you are,
Judgey Judgey Judgeyson,
but I am... You know, don't...
I'm just trying to get
to work.
Why don't you get
your pimp to drive you?
These people are good people.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I missed the sign
"good people only."
How do you know
what is in my soul?
Hey!
Oh, I can tell.
I can tell.
$1.50.
Okay. Does the $1.50
need to be paid
at every stop...
or does it cover
the entire journey?
Are you for serious?
I am for serious.
Do you take credit cards?
Yeah. You can swipe it
right there.
Really? That is amazing,
innovative technology...
that you can just...
Do you take
debit cards?
Do you have a debit card?
I do not.
Listen. I'm gonna give you
some advice.
Sure.
You might wanna think
about another line of work,
'cause you ain't
no good at this.
If you ain't even got $1.50,
you probably should
think about retiring
as a whore.
And if you do scrape up $1.50,
use it to buy yourself
a sandwich.
That's the reason
you can't turn no tricks...
'cause you ain't got
no meat on your bones.
Now, that advice was free,
but this ride is $1.50.
So you can pay that
or you can get your ass
off my bus.
Okay. I just need to get as
far away from this gang
territory as possible.
Really?
If you want, I can sit down
and tell you the whole story.
- No.
- No, no.
You don't have to get up.
You ain't nothing
but a skinny crack whore.
Now get your ass off my bus.
I am not a crack whore.
I... I...
- Hmm.
- Oh, that's...
But this is... this is part of
that long story that I wanted
to tell you about.
Okay, this...
Ugh! Yech!
You did good.
You did good.
All right, here it is.
Could I conduct
the interviews this time?
Hey, knock yourself out.
Latest report
has Caucasian woman
in yellow dress...
ejected
from municipal bus 32,
Western line.
This sounds
like a psychotic break.
That's pretty good there,
Dr. Phil.
Uh, X22 responding.
Hey, Dan.
Yeah.
I'm just
working on the new
Granny Bandit story.
Oh, Granny's old news.
I think we have
a better story brewing.
The discord
at this year's
G8 summit?
Don't be a smart-ass.
The network is coming
to see Meghan today.
- We have to do
a great show.
- Yeah.
- Have you seen her yet?
- Nope.
Did you try and call her?
Yes. Several times.
All right, if you
were Meghan Miles,
where would you be?
Nothing to see here.
Lord?
Hello.
Hello. Hello. Hi.
Oh.
Hi.
Can you help me?
But this is a place
of worship, right?
A house of God?
You're a rabbi.
No.
Oh, you're not a...
Isn't that what they're
called?
You're obviously a temptress
sent here to test my faith.
Oh.
Stimulation is
a distraction from,
and an offense to, God.
And with an uncovered head.
And this dress.
I shouldn't look.
Okay, can you please just...
Please, just go.
Come on.
You're telling me
in this day and age,
you're not going to let me use
the bathroom or make a call...
or-or give me bus fare?
Yeah, I just need...
I need $1.50.
No, no. Look,
there are no women
allowed in there, okay?
Women are kept separate
from the men.
In fact, our men
aren't even allowed
to hear a woman sing.
It's just bus fare.
That's really all I need.
No one will know.
There's no one here.
It's just us.
Okay. Look, of all
the prohibitions,
I love the female voice
mixing in the wind.
The lilt.
The sweetness.
Hmm.
Now, I know I cannot touch.
But can not my ears touch?
A small price of $1.50
would eagerly be paid
for such a delight.
Forbidden, though it is.
Um...
I threw a wish in a well
Don't ask me I'll never tell
I looked to you as it fell
But now you're in my way
Please don't stop.
Your stare was holding
Ripped jeans
Skin was showing
Hot night Wind was blowing
Where you think
you're going, baby?
Hey, I just met you
And this is crazy
But here's my number
Call me maybe
Call me maybe
-
Moshe, what's happening here?
- Uh...
Hello.
I don't know.
She-She-She just appeared.
She... She wants money.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
No, no, no. I sang for you,
and you owe me.
-
- What's that?
He called you a witch.
Okay, what is wrong with you?
You've got to have
some money in your pocket.
No, no, you can't!
Wait, wait!
Stop her!
Possible hate crime
at Wilshire "Ha"... "Ha"...
"Ha"... "Ha"...
"Ha"... "Ha"...
- "Habad."
- Chabad.
"Habad." Shit.
- It's a place of worship.
-
Hi.
Do you, uh... Hi.
I don't have...
Leave me alone.
Okay.
Hi. I'm Gordon.
You are
so not her type.
I get it though.
You guys wanna come in?
What is this,
an artist loft?
Are you a hipster?
Uh, no, not a hipster.
I can't grow
a convincing enough beard.
- Oh, my God. A single man
with a cat. Wow.
-
She's a rescue.
What a guy.
Why do you look so familiar?
I was also your bartender
last night.
I gave you all your seven
or eight rounds of shots.
Oh, so you, uh, stalk 'em,
you get 'em drunk,
then you take them home.
That is not
how it happened, okay?
She needed help.
I was trying to help her,
and we... well, we kind
of hit it off.
Denise,
four-point douche test.
Go.
What?
Have you ever been
to a strip club?
Yes, but they
make me uncomfortable.
What do you call
your penis?
My penis.
- That's hot.
- Denise, Focus.
Sorry. How do you feel
about Robert Pattinson?
Not my favorite actor.
You shut your mouth.
Okay.
Can I get
a "whoop, whoop"?
Whoop, whoop.
No. Don't ever
do that again.
Kill an innocent dog
or cheat on your girlfriend?
Cheat on my girlfriend.
I'm not going to kill
an innocent dog.
That's sick.
You passed.
Okay. So, we're good?
- Can I get a hot chocolate?
- Not so fast.
Which one is Karlin?
Hi. Dan.
Josh Feldman, CNB.
Jordan Gethers, CNB.
Ah. Dan Karlin, KZLA.
So, Miss Miles...
Where is she?
Oh. Well, normally,
Meghan would be here
by now.
But knowing Meghan,
she's out in the field
doing research.
Daddy, look. Look.
I think that's Lindsay Lohan.
No, honey.
Just keep walking.
Yes. Hi. Yes. I need help.
I'm in trouble and...
No, no. No police. I don't
need the police. I just need
help making a call.
I don't know any numbers
and I don't have any money.
I know a toll-free number.
Uh... Uh, yes.
Okay, listen.
Can you please connect me...
KZLA tip line.
What's your news tip?
Yes! Hi! Hi!
Hallelujah.
It's Meghan Miles.
Oh, I just need to speak
with Dan Karlin, please.
If you'd like to speak
to an employee,
you can call him or her
on their private line.
Okay, great.
Can you give me
Dan's number, please?
No, 'cause it's private.
No, no.
Okay, it's Meghan Miles.
From the news.
If your news
is that you're Meghan Miles
from the news,
then that's not news
'cause it's not true.
No, no. I need to speak
with Dan... Dan Kar...
You...
So, you drove her home
in her car.
Yes. That's right.
Why didn't you
take your car?
I don't have a car.
You don't have a car
in the city of Los Angeles.
How do you get around?
I take public
transportation mostly.
I will take the bus
to work normally.
Sometimes I take the subway.
You son of a bitch!
You killed her!
Jesus!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Denise!
He is lying to us.
There's no subway
in Los Angeles.
- Yes, there is.
- Where?
How come I've never seen it?
It's underground.
Right. Okay.
Sorry about that.
Okay.
So, she left her phone.
Uh, what else did she leave?
She didn't come in with much.
She had her phone and
her keys. I had her keys.
Well, where did you put them?
Over by the door, on the table.
The keys aren't here.
So she probably has her keys.
She has her key?
That's great.
She has the Keytective
key service
on her key chain.
Keytective
Find your keys with ease
What in God's name
are you rambling on about?
It's a little thing
that goes on your key chain...
and it has
a little computer inside,
and somehow
they can figure out
where the heck you are.
Anyway,
I told Meghan about it.
She thought it was sensible.
Let's call from the car,
see if the service number's
in there.
No, no.
Wait a minute.
She just got a text.
"Miles, wrong day
to be M.I.A. W.T.F."
- "What the fuck."
- "Network is here.
Job's yours if you can just
get here for a newscast.
Karlin."
Karlin is her boss.
Oh, my God.
We have to find her.
So, Mr. Karlin,
to your knowledge,
any questionable Flickr images,
tweets, pics, I.M.'s, e-mails,
Facebook status updates,
Yelp reviews,
anything at all associated
with Meghan Miles?
No. Uh, Meghan Miles
is a good girl.
Okay.
Come on.
Locked.
- Oh.
- Lady, what are you
doing with my bike?
I'm really, really sorry.
But I'm gonna need
to borrow your bike.
I got to get to my car.
I got to get my life back.
Have you ever had
one of those days...
where everything you do
just goes wrong?
And no matter
how hard you try
or how good your intentions,
life just keeps beating,
beating you down, huh?
Well, I could really use
a friend right now.
So if you just let me
borrow your bike,
I'll have it back to you
in no time.
Really, I promise.
It would just be so great
if you could help me out.
Okay.
Oh, kid.
You're an angel.
Show me your boobs
and I'll let you
borrow my bike.
Boobies.
I had higher hopes for you.
Yeah, let's go.
Get over here.
Come on.
All right, get in close.
Close your eyes first.
- I'm calling your mother.
- What are you doing?
That's my bike! Hey!
-
- It really seems like
she wants to get caught.
She's like a criminal beacon,
sending off signals.
- Where did you get that from?
- The detective's exam manual.
Gordon, this is
what a car looks like.
Oh, thank you.
This is so exciting!
Keytective.
Right here in her phone.
Calling. Calling, calling.
Uh... Meghan.
- Miles.
- Miles.
Meghan Miles.
That's me.
Uh... Password.
The... Is it
mother's maiden name?
Mr. T. My dog's name is Mr. T.
- Yeah, we went deep
last night.
- I bet you did.
Great.
They're running a trace.
Wow.
So, you actually
banged Meghan last night.
I am really proud of her
for letting go.
I really am.
Was she a freak?
I bet she was.
- I'm not talking about
the details with you.
- Did she juggle your balls?
Did she slap
you around a little bit,
tell you you're pretty?
Um...
'Cause you're pretty.
You saw this little
in the yellow dress
steal your bike?
She was really scary.
- You got a good look at her?
- Yeah. She had these,
like, crazy eyes.
All right, kid.
Come with us.
Hop in.
We'll do a ride-along, okay?
But when we find her,
I want five minutes alone
with her, okay?
Not okay, creepy kid.
Get in the back.
Be happy that you're coming.
Just concentrate
on apprehending the perp.
It's like the fucking
What? No.
I wouldn't want that
even if she'd agree to it.
Why? Is that something
that you... like?
It's just a pinky.
West on Normandie. Okay.
Great. Rose, go to Norton
and Wilshire.
I don't know where I am.
Three more blocks
and then make a right.
Hey, driver,
you got to go faster.
We have to find the bike.
It's "Officer." "Driver"?
What, your dad rich
or something?
My dad's taxes pay your bills.
Find the bike.
Kid, if you don't shut up,
I'm going to drop you off
right on this corner.
God, I just want
to find my bike!
And I just want
to be fucking fishing!
Oh, my God.
Oh, come on.
There you go.
You've really hurt
his feelings now.
Well, the kid's an asshole.
- What are you smoking?
- It's an e-cig.
Fake cigarette.
That's dumb.
I smoke weed.
Great.
Now we have to arrest you.
- No. I was kidding.
- Well, you're already
in the back.
- Why is this kid here?
- He's a witness.
The yellow dress
is going to give her away.
-
- You...
Over there! Over there!
There she is.
All right!
Make a U-turn. Hurry!
Go back!
All right,

Come on! Drive faster!
Stop banging on the glass!
There it is!
I see the bike.
Bingo.
She's here.
Stay in the car.

Oasis Spa.
You. What you fellows want?
Ma'am, we're in pursuit
of a suspect.
We just want to look around

You're not my guy.
I took care

What does that mean, Walter?
Don't worry about it.
Oh, yeah, yeah.

Ohh!
Oh, this is good.
Okay, she stopped moving.
We got an address. Let's do

No, no.
I go call my guy
at the station.
My guy, Vic.
Okay?
You know Vic?
Hilarious.
So, new girl, what's your name?

Yeah, yeah.
No, you tense. You tense.
Oh, yeah.
I had bad night.
This yellow whore cheat me
out of fare.

I chased her,

In this country,

Ah, ah. You... No, no.

Jesus Christ.
Did you see a woman
in a yellow dress?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
She steal money from me
and then she assaulted me.
-
- Whoa.
She can't have gotten too far.
Any luck with Miles?
Nothing.
We got to find her.
Carpocalypse.
I can get across.
- I just have to.
- No.
Oh, my God! God!
Oh, you scared me.
Who are you?
Oh, you scared...
What are you doing here?
Uh, I need to get
across the freeway.
Underpass about a mile down.
No, no.
I don't have to go that far.
Uh, the freeway's empty.
There won't be any cars
till 4:00 p.m.
I could maybe
let you cross here.
Great.
For a toll.
A toll?
I have nothing.
I have no money.
I have no...
I like those.
Oh, man.
I just got these.
They're a nice color.
Um... Yeah,
if we have an anchor.
You've got a feed
from Chopper Steve.
Check this out.
Yeah, Steve.
Oh, my God. There's
a woman in a yellow dress
trying to cross the freeway.
Freeze!
Put your hands
in the air!
Freeze!
Get down on the ground!
Put your hands
behind your back.
Hands back.
Hands in the air!
- Hands up or hands down?
- Do not move.
- Let me see your hands.
- Dave, stop talking
about her hands.
- Sorry, Walter.
- I got this.
Just let me handle this.
- Don't move. Don't move.
- We got her, Walter.
We got her.
- We got her.
- Game over, ma'am.
Stop!
Shit!
I knew it.
Ma'am, stop!
Come on, Dave.
Come on.
No!
Don't, don't, don't!
-
-
Ohh!
Oh, my God.
She made it.
Jesus Christ,
she's an Olympian.
Walter,
she's getting away!
Sorry!
Walter, we're stuck.
That chick is a psycho.
Good job, Steve.
Keep on her.
Suckers.
Boop-boop.
Do not call. Don't tell Vic!
I won't tell Vic,
but I got to call it in.
I will fucking shoot you.
You left your purse
in your car?
Yes.
And your shoes too?
Um, I don't see what the shoes
have to do with anything.
Okay, I cannot
let you in that car
without payment.
I have the key!
It's right here.
Look.
Boop-boop.
See the boop?
You can't block a boop-boop
with your hand.
Boop-boop.
Look. Turn around.
You'll see it boop-booping.
Mm-mmm. I'm not going
to fall for this.
Could be a trick.
What kind of trick?
What am I, a magician?
You need to calm down.
I'm trying to help you.
You are?
Yeah.
Really?
Yeah.
Now, what is the address...
from where "your" car was towed?
Okay. Yes.
It was, um...
Okay, well, it's not...
it's not my address,
um, because I was visiting
a friend at the time
of the towing.
He was a...
It was a new friend.
Naughty.
Are you telling me
that there's no way...
that I could go to my car
without my license...
and get my wallet
which has my money?
You see what I'm laying down?
You see
what I'm putting down?
I'm putting that down.
Are you trying to bribe me?
No.
That's a shame.
Because I was thinking
I might want Quiznos
for lunch today.
- How much?
- $500.
Quiznos does not cost...
$500?
It does for me.
Okay, you are going
to let me into my car.
Hands off of there.
You are going to let me
into my car!
Hands off.
Stop it.
Get your hands
off the glass.
Stop it.
No.
I can see it!
It's right there.
Hands off
the glass.
Get out of here.
Give me my car.
It's right there.
No, not my purse!
My purse. No! No! No!
No.
Fuck this.
Yes. Yeah!
Suck it, lady!
Oh!
Come on. Go. Come on. Go.
Come on. Go, go, go, go.
Come on. Come on.
No, no, no, no, no.
Gotcha.
I know you.
You're stuck again.
You gonna...
Hi. I'm Gordon. I'm...
From last night.
How you doing?
How you doing?
Any chance you
can pop the sunroof?
Yeah. Uh-huh.
All right, a little more.
Hi.
Watch yourself.
Let's get you out of here.
Apparently, you have
some news to deliver.
How did you know?
What are you...
I know everything.
Hi.
Where's your car?
I don't have a car.
What?
I know, I know.
Damn, what did you
do to yourself?
What did you do to my dress?
How did you guys find me?
You got to get me out of here.
Okay, tell me what's going on.
I can't believe
you guys are here.
You guys are...
- We did it!
- God, you're alive!
I can't believe we found you.
Thank you, guys.
I love you so much.
Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo!
How did you find me?
I got your friends
and your G.P.S.
- Your Keytective thing.
- Oh, my God!
Keytective!
My commercial.
You thought of that?
I know.
Do you want me to sing it?
No, don't sing it.
- Okay, I'm so sorry
that I left.
- No, no. It's okay.
I don't have a bigger
regret in my life.
It led to  most insane...
I don't do this sort
of thing at all.
It's okay.
Guys, I hate
to interrupt your second date,
cause it's really cute,
-
-
Bingo. We got her.
Who has my phone?
He does.
I got it.
I got it.
Meghan.
Where the hell are you?
Yeah, yeah. I'm on my way.
Have hair and makeup
standing by.
They're ready. They're ready.
Get here.
And can you connect me
to an outside line?
Hey there. I saw your ad
on Swinging Singles.
Let me ask you something.
How can you be that hot,
that young and that single?
Sorry. Got to go.
Duty calls.
Lady, get out of the way!
Does the fucking siren
not mean anything to you?
Meghan Miles,
This is Chopper Steve,
setting down.
Okay! I got to go.
I'll give you a call.
I got to do the news.
Good luck!
No. You come.
I'm not good with helicopters.
Good luck, Meghan!
You're gonna be great!
Kill it!
We love you, Meghan!
Christ on a piece
of halibut!
What happened to you?
I need to get to the station.
There's a girl
in a yellow dress out there
who almost got killed.
Yeah, yeah. That's nuts.
Let's go.
Let's cut some sky.
Meghan!
We love you, Meghan!
Good luck, Meghan!
You're gonna be great!
Read that news!
It's so exciting!
Let me do all the talking.
No, opposite, opposite.
Ma'am, did you see
a woman in a yellow dress
get on that helicopter?
I saw Meghan Miles,
undercover investigator
for KZLA,
get on a helicopter.
Wait. The woman we're chasing
is just a reporter?
Dear God, it's worse
than we ever imagined.
The hooker has
infiltrated the media,
where she's posing
as KZLA's Meghan Miles.
What do you mean,
she's infiltrated
the media?
So, you're saying
that our best friend Meghan
is an undercover hooker?
It looks that way.
So, you have
an idiot friend too?
Yeah. Mine's by choice.
You got stuck
with this guy, right?
We have her! Let's move!
Oh, my God, honey.
There's too much to do.
Let's get her on the chair.
Hurry up. Triage.
People, we don't have
much time.
Go, go, go, go, go.
Let's go.
Ten seconds to air.
Come on.
All right,
this is gonna be great.
It's up to me, right?
- Perfect.
-
In three, two, one.
All right, get out!
Oh.
Huh?
So let's just let the shame
lie with everyone...
Meghan, Have you lost your mind?
I'm so glad I dumped her.
We traced your number
from a recovered cell phone
used by a drug syndicate.
We did good.
We crushed it.
Hey, is it too early
for shots?
Hell to the no.
What are you still doing here?
So, I'm
a little bit crazy.
Also, you looked
really good in this dress.
I just remembered that part.
And one last thing.
Aw!
Aw!
What I'd tell ya?
What?
What?
That's my bitch
from the news.
Okay. Thanks, Dan.
- Good luck, Chuck.
-  Chuck,
move to Meghan's chair.
I think we should
get out of here.
Maybe we should go.
Yeah, I think we should.
You know what happened.
I'm not crazy.
Meghan.
No, what was crazy
about that?
Incredible.
Yeah,
I'm really sorry.
You should hire Chang.
I mean, what an incredible
idea for an investigative
series.
The girl in the yellow dress.
Right. But you know
I didn't plan that.
It was just what happened.
Even better. Like
meets...
Tyra Banks in a fat suit
meets
It's fresh.
Meghan, I know there's
something we can do together
at the network.
- What are we talking about?
- It's a reality show.
I love it.
Love it.
- Reality?
-
Your call.
I need to think about it
and get back to you.
Dan here can get
the ball rolling.
I just need a pair of shoes.
Maybe a sandwich.
Get you some shoes.
Oh, some food too.
Maybe brush my teeth.
Right?
No, no, you're fine.
Just do some hair fixing.
I got your back,
Meghan.
So, what do you have
in mind for us?
- You two are a package?
- Yeah, I'm her producer.
How much to go away?
Hey, babe.
There he is.
Arrest him.
Sir, we need you to stand up,
put your hands behind your back.
What are you talking about?
Put your cookies down.
Let's go.
What are you doing,
arresting me?
For what?
Being too sexy? Ow!
So, your place or mine?
Yeah. Um...
I'd love to show you mine.
It's very empty,
but it has a bed.
Nice. How are we
going to get there?
Ooh, I have not thought of that.
Uh, maybe we should
take that cab.
No. No, no.
No time for that.
No, it's not.
I never wanna see
a cab again.
Okay.
We're gonna walk.
That's fine with me.
This will be more
of an adventure.
