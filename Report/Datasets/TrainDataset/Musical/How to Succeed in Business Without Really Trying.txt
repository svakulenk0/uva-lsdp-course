BEFORE APPLYING FOR A JOB,
MAKE SURE THE COMPANY

THIS IS ESSENTIAL.
IT SHOULD BE AT LEAST
LARGE ENOUGH...
SO THAT NOBODY QUITE KNOWS
WHAT THE OTHER FELLOW IS DOING.
HERE !  HERE !

SIR,
BUT I'D LIKE TO APPLY FOR A JOB.
A JOB.
DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM ?
NO, SIR, I--
I'M J.B. BIGGLEY, THE
PRESIDENT OF THIS COMPANY.
THAT'S WHY I'M--
THAT'S WHO THE HELL I AM.
OH, MY.
HOW DARE YOU COME TO THE
PRESIDENT AND ASK FOR A JOB ?
WHY DO YOU THINK I HAVE
A PERSONNEL MAN ?
WHY DO YOU THINK I HAVE A WHOLE
DAMN PERSONNEL DEPARTMENT ?
YOU BUMPED INTO THE WRONG MAN.
DAMN, DAMN, COAL-BURNING,
DITHERING, DING, DING, DING.
DING, DING, DING, DING,
DING, DING.
YOU JUST COMMITTED
INDUSTRIAL SUICIDE, BOY.
THAT'S THE BIG FELLA.
OH !

HELLO.
DID YOU HURT YOURSELF ?
NO, NO.
I'M ALL RIGHT.
I KNOW HOW HARD IT IS TO--
WHAT ?
I KNOW HOW HARD IT IS
TO FIND A JOB.
I'VE BEEN THROUGH
THAT KIND OF THING MYSELF.
THANK YOU, YOU'RE VERY KIND.
COULD YOU TELL ME WHERE
THE PERSONNEL OFFICE IS ?
PERSONNEL ?  WELL,
IT'S RIGHT THERE.
OH.  THANK YOU.
WELL, LISTEN !
YOU MEAN YOU'RE
NOT DISCOURAGED ?
OH, NO, NOT AT ALL.
I'M PREPARED FOR
EXACTLY THIS SORT OF THING.
SAY, MY FRIEND SMITTY
WORKS IN PERSONNEL.
MAYBE SHE CAN HELP YOU.
SHE'S AROUND SOMEWHERE.
I'LL FIND HER.
NO !  THAT'S NOT NECESSARY.
PLEASE !
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
GO THROUGH, UH--
WHERE DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE GOING ?
TO SEE THE PERSONNEL MANAGER.
I'M THE MANAGER.
WE'RE NOT HIRING ANYONE.
WELL, I WAS JUST SPEAKING
TO MR. BIGGLEY.
BIGGLEY ?  J.B. BIGGLEY ?
YES, SIR.
HE TOLD ME TO SEE YOU.
YOU WERE SPEAKING
TO J.B. BIGGLEY HIMSELF ?
I JUST BUMPED INTO HIM.
HE'S A FRIEND OF YOURS ?
I DON'T THINK A MAN SHOULD TRADE
ON FRIENDSHIP TO GET A JOB.
BY GEORGE, I LIKE A MAN
WHO STANDS ON HIS OWN TWO FEET.
MY NAME IS BRATT.  YOU'RE--
FINCH, SIR.
PIERREPONT FINCH.
PIERREPONT.  COME IN.
YOU KNOW, MAYBE THAT OUGHT TO BE
J. PIERREPONT FINCH !
AS A MATTER OF FACT, SIR,
IT IS.
OH !
GOOD GAD, ROSEMARY.
YOU COULD AT LEAST LET ME
FINISH MY METRECAL.
WHAT'S THE BIG URGENT URGENCY ?
OH, HE HAS THAT WOEBEGONE LOOK.
A PUPPY DOG.
WELL, YOU COULD JUST TELL
HE'LL NEVER GET ANYWHERE.
I FIGURED YOU COULD INTRODUCE--
WHERE'D HE GO ?
HOW SHOULD I KNOW ?
ROSEMARY,
WHAT'S GOT INTO YOU ?
WHERE IS THIS CREEP DIFFERENT
FROM ALL OTHER CREEPS ?
HE'S NOT A CREEP !
SMITTY, HE HAS
A SORT OF UNDAUNTED
SORT OF NOBLE COURAGE.
YET DEEP DOWN, YOU SENSE
HE'S A HELPLESS
LITTLE MUFFIN.
...THE MAN
IN THE MANHOLE COVER.
THAT'S A GOOD ONE.
IT'S ALL SETTLED, THEN.
NICE TO HAVE YOU ABOARD, FINCH.
WELL, I'M HAPPY TO SHIP OUT
WITH YOU, SIR.  REALLY.
YOU DON'T HAVE A--
OH, YES, YES.
LET ME DO THAT FOR YOU.
IS THAT THE--
HELPLESS LITTLE MUFFIN.
MY SECRETARY WILL
FILL OUT THE FORMS.
OH, SMITTY ?
YES, MR. BRATT ?
THIS IS OUR NEW MR. FINCH.
HELLO.
MY NAME IS PILKINGTON.
ROSEMARY PILKINGTON.
HELLO.
HI.  I'M
LUCILLE KRUMHOLTZ.
MR. FINCH WILL BE
STARTING OUT IN OUR MAIL ROOM.
GLAD YOU DON'T MIND THAT, FINCH.
OH, SIR, IN A BIG POND
LIKE THIS, EVERYONE MUST
BEGIN AS A LITTLE FISH.
EVEN A BARRACUDA.
WHAT'D YOU SAY ?
SAY, BUD.  HAVE YOU GUYS
IN THE MAIL ROOM SENT OUT
THOSE NEW WICKET CATALOGS YET ?
I DON'T KNOW.
I'M GOING TO THE BARBER SHOP
TO GET A SCALP MASSAGE.
AT THIS TIME
OF THE MORNING ?  WHY ?
BECAUSE I'M THE BOSS'S NEPHEW.
EXCUSE ME.
OH, BUD.
THIS IS BUD FRUMP,
MR. BIGGLEY'S NEPHEW.
SAY HELLO TO OUR NEW MR. FINCH.
HE'LL BE WORKING WITH YOU
IN THE MAIL ROOM.
HELLO, FINCH.
I'M BUD FRUMP,
MR. BIGGLEY'S NEPHEW.
HOW DO YOU DO ?
SMITTY ?
YES, MR. BRATT ?
GET MR. FINCH'S
VITAL STATISTICS.
YES, MR. BRATT.
NICE TO HAVE YOU
ON THE TEAM, FINCH.
GOOD TO BE PLAYING
WITH YOU, SIR.
ARE YOU AMBITIOUS ?
NO, NOT NECESSARILY.
GOOD.  YOU JUST
KEEP THAT IN MIND.
IF YOU JUST REMEMBER
WHO I AM AND WHO YOU ARE,
WE'LL GET ALONG FINE.  IF NOT--
YOU'LL GO CRYING
TO YOUR UNCLE.
I BEG YOUR PARDON !
I DO NOT GO CRYING
TO MY UNCLE !
IT JUST HAPPENS THAT MY MOTHER
IS MRS. BIGGLEY'S SISTER.
IF SOMETHING IS WRONG,
I PHONE MY MOTHER.
SHE PHONES MRS. BIGGLEY,
AND MRS. BIGGLEY
PHONES MR. BIGGLEY.
THAT'S THE DEMOCRATIC WAY.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
WORRY ABOUT BUD FRUMP.
EVERY COMPANY HAS A COUPLE
OF RELATIVES FLOATING AROUND.
SMITTY, YOU WERE GOING
TO GET MR. FINCH'S
VITAL STATISTICS.
OH, YES.  THE FIRST
QUESTION IS--
MARRIED ?
MARRIED ?  NO.
I'M NOT, AND I DON'T EVEN
HAVE A GIRLFRIEND.
GOOD !
GOOD.  I MEAN, IT'S GOOD YOU
ANSWERED WITH THE RIGHT ANSWER.
FOR THE QUESTIONNAIRE,
THAT IS.  IT'S NOT VERY WISE
TO HAVE A GIRL.
NO, IT ISN'T.
I'M GLAD YOU UNDERSTAND THAT.
SOME WOMEN WOULDN'T.
I FEEL THAT
WHEN A MAN WANTS TO RISE
IN THE WORLD OF BUSINESS,
A GIRL, OR LET'S SAY
AN EMOTIONAL INVOLVEMENT,
CAN ONLY LEAD TO GETTING
INVOLVED... EMOTIONALLY.
WHAT THE HECK WAS THAT ?
THAT'S VERY INTELLIGENT,
MR. FINCH.
ARE YOU QUITE FINISHED
WITH MR. FINCH ?
FOR THE MOMENT.
IRVING !  TAKE MR. FINCH
TO THE MAIL ROOM AND INTRODUCE
HIM TO MR. TWIMBLE.
YOU CAN FILL IN
THE PERSONNEL FORMS LATER.
COME ON, FINCH.
OH, WELL, GOOD LUCK,
MR. FINCH.
THANK YOU, UH, MISS--
PILKINGTON.
ROSEMARY PILKINGTON.
PILKINGTON.
ROSEMARY PILKINGTON.
COME ON, FINCH.
POOR BABY.
HE LOOKS SO UTTERLY VULNERABLE.
THEY'LL EAT HIM ALIVE
IN THIS JUNGLE.
- COFFEE BREAK !
- WELL, IT'S ABOUT TIME !
JUST TAKE CARE OF THE EXECUTIVE
MAIL !  THAT'S ALL YOU
GOTTA TAKE CARE OF !
LOOK, LOOK, DON'T WORRY !
I'M DOING THE VERY BEST
I CAN, MR. TWIMBLE !
WELL, DON'T ARGUE !  JUST GET
THE EXECUTIVE MAIL OUT.  THAT'S
ALL YOU'VE GOT TO WORRY ABOUT !
LEMON DROPS ?
WHERE DID THESE LEMON DROPS
COME FROM ?
OH, THEY'RE MINE,
MR. TWIMBLE.
I JUST THOUGHT
I'D SHARE THEM
WITH OUR MAIL ROOM FAMILY.
LEMON IS MY FAVORITE DROP.
OH, I'LL BE DARNED.
UH, FINCH ?
YES, SIR ?
I'VE BEEN WATCHING YOU
THIS FIRST MORNING, AND I'M
VERY PLEASED WITH YOUR WORK.
THANK YOU, SIR.
THAT'S EXCEPTIONALLY KIND.

GIFT FOR "MAIL ROOMERY."
THANK YOU--
OH, EXCUSE ME, SIR.

MR. TWIMBLE, IT'S FOR YOU.
IT'S MR. BRATT, IN PERSONNEL.
THIS MAY BE AN IMPORTANT CALL
FOR SOME OF US !  HELLO ?
GOOD MORNING, MR. BRATT !
OH, YES, YES.
HEY, WHAT'S THE IDEA ?
THE IDEA OF WHAT, BUD ?
YOU'RE TRYING TO BUTTER UP
MR. TWIMBLE.  WELL, IT WON'T
DO YOU ANY GOOD.
GOOD GOSH !  JUST BECAUSE
I'M BEING NICE TO AN OLDER MAN--
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE UP TO,
AND IF ANYBODY'S GONNA GET HIS
JOB--
MR. BRATT.
THANKS VERY MUCH.
WELL, BOYS, THEY'RE FINALLY
GONNA PROMOTE OLD TWIMBLE
TO THE SHIPPING DEPARTMENT.
CONGRATULATIONS.
UH, YEAH, CONGRATULATIONS.
WHO'S GONNA BE NEW HEAD
OF THE MAIL ROOM ?
MR. BRATT IS GONNA
LEAVE THE CHOICE TO ME.
"TWIMBLE," HE SAID, "THE
MAIL ROOM IS THE NERVE CENTER
OF THIS MIGHTY ORGANIZATION.
"YOU'VE BEEN AN OUTSTANDING
MAIL ROOM HEAD.  WE WANT YOU
TO CHOOSE YOUR SUCCESSOR.
"WE WANT YOU TO CHOOSE HIM
ON MERIT.
ON MERIT ALONE."
THAT'S NOT FAIR !
I'M GOING OUT
TO HAVE A SMOKE.
SMOKE ?
HE'S GONNA CALL HIS MOTHER.
IT WON'T DO HIM ANY GOOD.
BRATT SAID I WAS GONNA
SELECT THE NEW HEAD.
MR. TWIMBLE ?
YEAH ?
YOU'VE BEEN WITH THIS COMPANY
A LONG TIME NOW, HAVEN'T YOU ?
A LONG TIME.
LAST MONTH I BECAME
A QUARTER-OF-A-CENTURY MAN.
OH, THAT'S BEAUTIFUL.
A QUARTER OF A CENTURY ?
QUARTER OF A CENTURY.
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN
IN THE MAIL ROOM ?
TWENTY-FIVE YEARS.
IT'S NOT EASY TO GET THIS MEDAL.
TAKES A COMBINATION OF SKILL,
DIPLOMACY...
AND BOLD CAUTION.
?? WHEN I JOINED THIS FIRM ??
?? AS A BRASH YOUNG MAN ??
?? WELL, I SAID TO MYSELF
NOW BRASH YOUNG MAN ??
?? DON'T GET ANY IDEAS ??
?? WELL, I STUCK TO THAT
AND I HAVEN'T HAD ONE
IN YEARS ??
YOU PLAY IT SAFE.
?? I PLAY IT THE COMPANY WAY ??
?? WHEREVER THE COMPANY PUTS ME
THERE I'LL STAY ??
?? BUT WHAT IS YOUR
POINT OF VIEW ??
?? I HAVE NO POINT OF VIEW ??
?? SUPPOSING THE COMPANY
THINKS ??
?? I THINK SO TOO ??
WELL, WHAT WOULD YOU
SAY IF--
I WOULDN'T SAY.  I WOULDN'T SAY.
?? YOUR FACE
IS A COMPANY FACE ??
?? IT SMILES AT EXECUTIVES
THEN GOES BACK IN PLACE ??
?? THE COMPANY FURNITURE ??
?? OH, IT SUITS ME FINE ??
?? THE COMPANY LETTERHEAD ??
?? A VALENTINE ??
IS THERE ANYTHING
YOU'RE AGAINST ?
UNEMPLOYMENT.
?? WHEN THEY WANT
BRILLIANT THINKING ??
?? FROM EMPLOYEES ??
?? THAT IS NO CONCERN OF MINE ??
?? SUPPOSE A MAN OF GENIUS
MAKES SUGGESTIONS ??
?? WATCH THAT GENIUS
GET SUGGESTED TO RESIGN ??
?? SO YOU PLAY IT
THE COMPANY WAY ??
?? OH, COMPANY POLICY
IS BY ME OKAY ??
?? YOU'LL NEVER RISE UP
TO THE TOP ??
?? BUT THERE'S ONE THING CLEAR
WHOEVER THE COMPANY FIRES ??
??
?? I WILL STILL BE HERE
OH, YOU CERTAINLY
FOUND A HOME.
IT'S COZY.
?? YOUR BRAIN
IS A COMPANY BRAIN ??
?? THE COMPANY WASHED IT
NOW I CAN'T COMPLAIN ??
?? THE COMPANY MAGAZINE ??
?? BOY, WHAT STYLE
WHAT PUNCH ??
?? THE COMPANY RESTAURANT ??
?? EVERY DAY, SAME LUNCH ??
THEIR HADDOCK SANDWICH,
IT'S DELICIOUS.
OH, I MUST TRY IT.
EARLY IN THE WEEK.
?
?? DO YOU HAVE ANY HOBBIES ?
?? I'VE A HOBBY
I PLAY GIN WITH MR. BRATT ??
MR. BRATT !
?? AND DO YOU
PLAY IT NICELY ??
?? PLAY IT NICELY ??
?? STILL, HE BLITZES ME
IN EVERY GAME LIKE THAT ??
WHY ?
?? 'CAUSE I PLAY IT
THE COMPANY WAY ??
THE COMPANY WAY.  YES !
EXECUTIVE POLICY.
?? EXECUTIVE POLICY
IS BY ME OKAY ??
?? HOW CAN YOU GET
ANYWHERE ??
?? JUNIOR, HAVE NO FEAR ??
?? WHOEVER THE COMPANY FIRES
I WILL STILL BE HERE ??
?? YOU WILL STILL BE HERE ??
?? YEAR AFTER YEAR
AFTER FISCAL ??
?? NEVER TAKE A RISK-AL
YEAR ????
?? OH, YEAH ????
ALL RIGHT.
I'LL GET THIS OUT
AS SOON AS I CAN.
NOT AS SOON AS YOU CAN !
I WANT IT BY NOON,
MISS PILKINGTON !
YES, SIR.
WOW.  HI.  DO YOU WORK
FOR MR. OVINGTON, MISS--

OH, WHY DON'T YOU CALL ME,
UH, PONTY.
OKAY, PONTY.
I LIKE THAT.
HOW'S IT GOING ?
OH, PRETTY GOOD.

EVERYBODY'S SO BUSY.
THEY DON'T EVEN NOTICE ME.
OH, THEY WILL.

YOUNG MAN.

YOU JUST WANT ME
TO HAVE THIS FLOWER ?
YOU DON'T KNOW WHO I AM ?
IT DOESN'T MATTER.
WHAT MATTERS IS THE FLOWER.
IT SEEMED TO CRY OUT TO BE WORN.
BY YOU.
YOUNG MAN.
I'M MISS JONES,
MR. J.B. BIGGLEY'S SECRETARY.
OH, NO !
NO.  YOU COULDN'T BE.
WHY NOT ?
WELL, FROM BUD FRUMP'S
DESCRIPTION OF YOU.
I'D NEVER HAVE--
WELL, YOU--
YOU'RE NOT
A FRIGHTENING PERSON.
THANK YOU.
AND IF IT'S NOT OUT OF PLACE
FOR ME TO SAY SO, MISS JONES,
I THINK YOU'RE VERY ATTRACTIVE,
NO MATTER WHAT BUD FRUMP SAYS.
WHAT DID YOU SAY
YOUR NAME WAS ?
FINCH.  F-I-N-C-H.
FINCH.  PIERREPONT FINCH.
WHY HAVEN'T I SEEN YOU
AROUND HERE BEFORE ?
I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO DELIVER
THE EXECUTIVE MAIL.
THAT'S HIS JOB.
BUD FRUMP.  F-R-U-M-P.
HMM.  WELL, THANK YOU
FOR THE FLOWER, FINCH.
YOU'RE A VERY INTERESTING
YOUNG MAN.
YOU'RE WELCOME, MISS JONES.
JONESIE, I'D LIKE AN APPOINTMENT
WITH THE BOSS AT AROUND 3:00.
I'LL LET YOU KNOW, MILT.
AH, FLOWERS.
GOT A NEW BOYFRIEND,
JONESIE ?
THIS WAS GIVEN TO ME
BY A VERY NICE YOUNG MAN.
YOU SHOULD KNOW HIM.  FINCH ?
YES, MA'AM ?
FINCH, THIS IS
MR. GATCH.
HOW ARE YOU, SON ?
MR. GATCH IS GOOD TO KNOW.  HIS
DEPARTMENT IS VERY IMPORTANT.
I KNOW ALL ABOUT MR. GATCH.
HE'S MANAGER OF EXECUTIVE
PERSONNEL PLACEMENT.
WONDERFUL MEMO THAT YOU PUT OUT
THIS MORNING, SIR,
ABOUT THAT, UH, EXECUTIVE
PERSONNEL PLACEMENT SERVICE.
YOU READ THE MEMOS ?
AND YOUR NAME IS--
FINCH.  F-I-N--
C-H.
C-H.  YES.
SAY, JONESIE,
THIS IS A SMART ONE.
WE'LL HAVE TO
KEEP AN EYE ON HIM.
AH, THAT'S A VERY FINE MAN,
MR. GATCH.
I HEAR HE HAS A FINE OPENING
IN HIS DEPARTMENT.
BUT HE HASN'T BEEN ABLE
TO MAKE UP HIS MIND.
WELL, AGAIN, THANKS
FOR THE FLOWER, YOUNG MAN.
YOU'RE WELCOME.
I CAUGHT YOU !
YOU GIVE ME THAT.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING ?
A FELLA CAN'T GO FOR A SMOKE
WITHOUT GETTING STABBED !
IT'S THE EXECUTIVE MAIL !
THE EXECUTIVE MAIL
IS MY JOB.
MR. TWIMBLE TOLD ME--
IF YOU HAVE ANY IDEAS ABOUT
CLIMBING THE LADDER HERE,
THE VIEW IS GONNA GET
AWFULLY MONOTONOUS.
EVERY TIME YOU LOOK UP,
YOU'RE GONNA SEE
THE SEAT OF MY PANTS.
HIYA, JONESIE.
"MISS JONES" TO YOU,
IF YOU DON'T MIND.
MR. BIGGLEY'S OFFICE.
ONE MOMENT, PLEASE.
YES, MISS JONES.
WHAT IS IT ?
YOUR WIFE IS ON LINE TWO.
TELL HER I'M BUSY.
TELL HER I'M IN A MEETING.
TELL HER I'M OUT.
DAMN IT.  PUT HER ON.
HELLO, GERTRUDE.
GLAD YOU CALLED.
DEAR, I WANT TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT BUD.
I'M BUSY.
NOW, JASPER,
THIS IS IMPORTANT.
WHAT IS IT THIS TIME ?
HE'S HEARD THERE'S
GOING TO BE AN OPENING
IN THE MAIL ROOM MANAGEMENT.
I CAN'T HELP BUD THERE.
THE HEAD OF THE MAIL ROOM SHOULD
CHOOSE HIS OWN SUCCESSOR.
YOU'RE THE HEAD OF THE COMPANY.
I CAN'T SWITCH SIGNALS
IN THE MIDDLE OF A PLAY.
IT WOULD UPSET THE TEAM.
IF YOU WANTED TO,
YOU COULD !
IF I INTERFERED,
IT'D BE NEPOTISM.
IT WOULD BE WHAT ?
NEPOTISM !
WHAT'S NEPOTISM ?
THAT'S WHEN YOUR NEPHEW
IS A DAMN POOP.
NOW, LOOK HERE, JASPER--
I'LL DO SOMETHING.
I'LL DO SOMETHING.
DAMN, DAMN COAL-BURNING,
DITHERING, DING, DING.
MISS JONES.
YES, MR. BIGGLEY ?
YOU KNOW THAT TALKING
TO MY WIFE UPSETS ME.
YOU SAID TO PUT HER ON.
NEVER MIND THAT.  I NEED
SOMETHING TO CALM MY NERVES !
WHERE IS MY--
YOU KNOW.
I PUT IT IN THE BACK
OF YOUR RIGHT-HAND DRAWER.
AH, YES, YES, YES.
HERE IT IS.
CONGRATULATIONS.
YOU HAVE FOLLOWED INSTRUCTIONS
AND HAVE MADE IT TO THE FIRST
RUNG OF THE LADDER.
YOU ARE WORKING
IN THE MAIL ROOM.
ONE WORD OF CAUTION
ABOUT THE MAIL ROOM.
IT IS A PLACE
OUT OF WHICH YOU MUST GET.
WELL, TWIMBLE,
WE'VE GOT GREAT NEWS FOR YOU !
YES, MR. BRATT ?
BOYS, BOYS, GATHER ROUND.
GATHER ROUND.
BOYS, AS OF TODAY YOUR BOSS
IS BEING PROMOTED TO HEAD
OF THE SHIPPING DEPARTMENT.
ALL RIGHT, BOYS.
BACK TO WORK.  BACK TO WORK.
NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT
YOUR SUCCESSOR.
OH, SAY, MR. BRATT !
HAVE YOU HEARD FROM
MY UNCLE TODAY ?
NO, BUD.
ALL RIGHT, TWIMBLE, YOUR SHOES
ARE GOING TO BE HARD TO FILL,
BUT WHO HAVE YOU PICKED ?
I'VE GIVEN IT A GOOD DEAL
OF THOUGHT,
AND I THINK THIS IS OUR MAN.
CONGRATULATIONS, FINCH !
I'M GOING OUT FOR A SMOKE.
THANKS.
NO, I CAN'T ACCEPT.
ARE YOU TURNING THIS JOB DOWN ?
YES, SIR.  I THINK THERE'S
A MAN WHO'S BETTER QUALIFIED,
AND A MAN WHO'S BEEN HERE
LONGER THAN I HAVE.
GENTLEMEN, I RECOMMEND
BUD FRUMP FOR THIS JOB.
YOU'RE KIDDING.
NO.
BUD FRUMP.  YECH.
AS LONG AS HE FEELS SO STRONGLY,
I'LL GO WITH THE RECOMMENDATION.
I GOTTA CALL MY MOTHER !
SHE'LL BE SO HAPPY !
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
YES, UH, WELL, MR. TWIMBLE,
LET ME EXPLAIN.
KNOWING YOU HAS TAUGHT ME
A LOT ABOUT-- WELL,
THE CORPORATE SETUP.
HELLO, MAIL ROOM.
OH, YES, J.B.
THIS IS BRATT.
THAT'S THE BIG BOSS.
THAT SISTER-IN-LAW OF MINE HAS
BEEN CALLING MY WIFE AND GIVING
ME A BAD TIME ABOUT BUD FRUMP.
I UNDERSTAND YOUR PROBLEM, J.B.
ACTUALLY WE HAD PICKED SOMEONE
ELSE, BUT IT'S TURNED OUT FINE.
THE YOUNG FELLOW
TURNED THE JOB OVER TO BUD.
HE THINKS BUD'S
BETTER QUALIFIED.
NO, HE DOESN'T SEEM
TO BE OUT OF HIS MIND.
HE WAS EXPLAINING
WHEN YOU CALLED.
GO AHEAD, FINCH.
MR. TWIMBLE, THE GREAT THING
THAT YOU'VE TAUGHT ME...
IS THAT NO INDIVIDUAL IS AS
IMPORTANT AS THE WHOLE COMPANY.
NO INDIVIDUAL
IS AS IMPORTANT
AS THE COMPANY.
THE WHOLE TEAM IS GREATER
THAN ANY SINGLE PLAYER.
THE WHOLE TEAM IS GREATER.
THE WHOLE CREW IS GREATER
THAN ANY ONE OARSMAN.
THE WHOLE CREW IS GREATER !
THE WHOLE SALAD IS LARGER
THAN ONE PIECE OF LETTUCE.
THE WHOLE SALAD--
OH, YOU CAN HEAR HIM.
THE WHOLE OMELET...
IS LARGER THAN ONE EGG
THAT YOU MIGHT--
SEE--
ISN'T THAT GREAT, J.B. ?
SORT OF CHOKES YOU UP.
HIS NAME'S FINCH.
F-I-N-C-H.
F-I-N-C-H.
WHAT IT MEANS IS--
I WAS JUST GOING TO SAY
THAT SAME THING, J.B. !
WE SHOULD KEEP AN EYE
ON THAT YOUNG LAD.
NICE TO CHAT
WITH YOU, J.B.
SEE YOU LATER.
OH, FINCH, YOU
GOT ME OFF THE SPOT
WITH MR. BIGGLEY.
I'M GLAD
TO BE OF HELP, SIR.
OH, THAT FEELS GOOD.
WELL, TWIMBLE, GOOD LUCK
IN THE NEW JOB, SIR.
THANKS, MR. BRATT.
KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK.

WOMAN WHO CALLS THE COMPANY.
WHAT'S HER NAME ?
SHE SAID YOU'LL KNOW.
OH.
HELLO.  YOU KNEW
I WOULDN'T FORGET.
I'LL TAKE CARE OF EVERYTHING.
JUST A MOMENT.
MISS JONES, GET ME BRATT

THERE, YOU SEE, IT'S ALL SET.
COME IN ANY TIME.
ASK FOR THE PERSONNEL MANAGER.
HIS NAME IS BRATT.
HE'LL TAKE CARE OF EVERYTHING.
?? GOOD-BYE ????
BRATT, THIS IS J.B.
I'D LIKE YOU TO DO ME A FAVOR.
I WONDER IF YOU COULD FIND
A SPOT FOR A YOUNG LADY ?
SHE WANTS TO BE A SECRETARY.
SHE'S AN OLD FRIEND
OF THE FAMILY.
DAD WAS A CLASSMATE OF MINE
AT OLD IVY.
SHE'S A BRIGHT GIRL, GOT
A GOOD HEAD ON HER SHOULDERS.
HER NAME ?
LaRUE.  HEDY LaRUE.
UH, MAY I HELP YOU, HONEY ?
"SCA-ROO."

SORRY TO HAVE KEPT YOU WAITING.
OH, NOT AT ALL, SIR.
IT IS I WHOM AM LATE.
OH, NO, NOT REALLY.
OH, YES.  I WAS VERY NAUGHTY
THIS MORNING.
I'M STILL NOT ACCUSTOMED
TO EARLY "ARISAL."
OH, I UNDERSTAND.
WELL, WHY DON'T WE
MOVE UP TO MY OFFICE,
MISS LaRUE.
I HOPE YOU DIDN'T HAVE ANY
TROUBLE FINDING THE BUILDING ?
OH, NO, THE TAXI DROPPED ME
RIGHT OFF DOWNSTAIRS.
THIS IS MY SECRETARY.
MISS, UH--  MISS--
SMITH.
HOW ARE YOU, DEAR ?
OH, FINE, DEAR.
MR. BRATT, I HAVE TO GO DOWN

I HAVE TO GO DOWN TO ACCOUNTING
AND GET SOME WITHHOLDING BLANKS.
YES, YES, YOU DO THAT.
JUST THROUGH HERE, MISS LaRUE.

A NEW SECRETARY.
GENTLEMEN, MISS LaRUE
WILL BE ASSIGNED ACCORDING
TO NORMAL PROCEDURES...
AS SOON AS HER QUALIFICATIONS
HAVE BEEN DETERMINED.
I'LL DETERMINE 'EM.
COUNT ME IN.
GENTLEMEN !
?? A SECRETARY IS NOT A TOY ??
?? NO, MY BOY
NOT A TOY ??
?? TO FONDLE AND DANDLE ??
?? AND PLAYFULLY HANDLE ??
?? IN SEARCH OF
SOME PUERILE JOY ??
?? NO ??
?? A SECRETARY IS NOT ??
?? DEFINITELY NOT A TOY ????
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT,
MR. BRATT.
WE WOULDN'T HAVE IT
ANY OTHER WAY, MR. BRATT.
IT'S THE COMPANY RULE,
MR. BRATT.
????
??
?? A SECRETARY IS NOT A TOY
?? NO, MY BOY
NOT A TOY ??
?? SO DO NOT GO
JUMPING FOR JOY ??
?? BOY, A SECRETARY IS NOT ?
?
?? A SECRETARY IS NOT ??
?? A SECRETARY IS NOT ??
?? A TOY ??
?? A SECRETARY IS NOT TO BE
USED FOR PLAY THERAPY ??
?? BE GOOD TO THE GIRL
YOU EMPLOY, BOY ??
?? REMEMBER NO MATTER WHAT ??
?
?? NEUROTIC TROUBLE YOU'VE GOT ?
?? A SECRETARY IS NOT
A TOY ??
????
????
?? A SECRETARY IS NOT
A TOY ??
?
?? AND WHEN YOU PUT HER TO USE ?
?? OBSERVE WHEN YOU PUT HER ??
?? TO USE ??
?? THAT YOU DON'T FIND
THE NAME LIONEL ??
?? ON HER CABOOSE ??
?? A SECRETARY IS NOT A THING ??
?? WOUND BY KEY
PULLED BY STRING ??
?? HER PAD IS TO WRITE IN ??
?? AND NOT SPEND THE NIGHT IN ??
?? IF THAT'S WHAT YOU PLAN
TO ENJOY ??
?? NO ??
????
?? A SECRETARY IS NOT ??
?? IS DEFINITELY NOT ??
?? EMPLOYED TO DO A GAVOTTE
OR YOU-KNOW-WHAT ??
?
?? BEFORE YOU JUMP FOR JOY ?
?? REMEMBER THIS, MY BOY ??
????
?? A SECRETARY IS NOT ??
?? A TINKERTOY ????
MISS JONES, BE SURE THAT I CALL
KIMBALL IN OUR TEXAS OFFICE
MONDAY MORNING.
PUSH THAT BOARD MEETING
UP TO 10:00.  AND DID YOU
CALL MRS. BIGGLEY...
AND TELL HER I WOULDN'T

YES, SIR.
INCIDENTALLY, YOU LEFT YOUR
GOLF CLUBS IN THE OFFICE.
TOMORROW'S SATURDAY.
REMEMBER YOU'RE PLAYING GOLF
WITH THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD.
YES.  I'M STAYING IN TOWN.
I'LL COME DOWN TO THE OFFICE
AND PICK UP THE CLUBS.
YOU ASKED TO BE REMINDED ABOUT
YOUR COLLEGE ALUMNI ASSOCIATION.
SEND THEM THAT SAME CHECK.
I GET A KICK OUT OF THINKING
OF THEIR FACES...
WHEN THEY GET THAT FAT CHECK
FROM OLD LEAST-LIKELY-

HOW SWEET OF YOU TO BE
INTERESTED IN A LITTLE THING

I'D LOVE THAT, BUT
I SHOULD GET TO BED EARLY.
SEE, I HAVE TO WORK
TOMORROW.
ON SATURDAY ?

PONTY, YOU'RE
A VERY UNUSUAL BOY.

WE COULD MEET ??

VEGETABLE PLATE ??

OF THE AD ??
?? NOT BAD
SERVICE FOR TWO
THREE FIFTY-EIGHT ??
?? TO MAKE A BARGAIN
MAKE A DATE ??
WONDERFUL.
IT'S FATE.
?? NOW SHE'S THINKING ??
?? WHAT FEMALE KIND OF TRAP
COULD I SPRING ??
?? AND HE'S THINKING ??
?? I MIGHT AS WELL
FORGET THE WHOLE THING ??
?? NOW SHE'S THINKING ??

I TAKE HIS ARM ??
?? AND HE'S THINKING ??

J.B. !
BLITHERING, BLATHERING !
YOU'VE BEEN CALLING YOUR MOTHER.
SHE WANTS YOU PROMOTED.
WHY NOT ?  OTHER PEOPLE
ARE BEING PROMOTED.
I TOLD YOUR AUNT--
OH, THERE YOU--
GOOD EVENING, MR. BIGGLEY.
GOOD EVENING,
MISS LaRUE.
UNCLE JASPER, I WANT--
I TOLD YOU NEVER TO CALL ME
THAT AROUND HERE.
HAVEN'T YOU SOMETHING
TO DO ?
I WAS JUST GONNA GET MY HAT
AND GO HOME.
GOOD.  DO IT !
HOW DO YOU LIKE
YOUR NEW JOB, MISS LaRUE ?
IT'S A BIG FAT NOTHING.
DON'T TALK LIKE THAT HERE !
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA HELP ME
BE A BIG BUSINESS WOMAN...
LIKE HELENA RUBENSTEIN
OR FANNIE FARMER.
SO WHAT HAPPENS ?
I'M STUCK IN THE LOUSY
STENOGRAPHIC POOL...
WITH NO ONE TO FISH ME
THE HELL OUT.
BUT ANGEL, THESE
THINGS TAKE TIME.
YOU HAVE TO LEARN--
YES, MISS LaRUE,
IN A LARGE OPERATION
LIKE WORLD WIDE WICKETS,
THERE ARE MULTIPLE FACETS
WHICH ARE VERY IMPORTANT
TO THE SCHEME OF THINGS.
I GAVE UP A WONDERFUL JOB.
HEAD CIGARETTE GIRL AT THE COPA.
I THOUGHT YOU HATED
ALL THOSE MEN STARING
AT YOU, MAKING ADVANCES.
WELL, IT'S NO DIFFERENT HERE
IN BIG BUSINESS.
AT LEAST AT THE COPA, WHEN I
GOT PINCHED, I GOT TIPPED.
AROUND HERE, A GIRL CAN'T EVEN
BEND DOWN TO PICK UP A PENCIL
WITH CONFIDENCE.
YOU MEAN SOMEBODY'S BEEN
BOTHERING YOU ?  WHO ?
JUST LET ME KNOW WHO HE IS--
YES !  MISS LaRUE, IN A LARGE
OPERATION LIKE WORLD WIDE FACETS
THERE ARE MULTIPLE WICKETS--
WHO PINCHED YOU ?
I DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT.
LOOK.
YOU DID NOT KEEP YOUR PART
OF MY BARGAIN.
BUT DARLING, I MEANT EVERY WORD.
TELL YOU WHAT.  I'LL MEET YOU
AT YOUR PLACE IN TEN MINUTES.
WE'LL TALK EVERYTHING OVER.
NO.
BUT ANGEL--
YES, MISS LaRUE,
IN A LARGE OPERATION--
WHY DON'T YOU GO HOME ?
I'M WAITING
FOR THE ELEVATOR.
WHY DON'T YOU WALK DOWN ?
IT'S 30 FLOORS.
WHY DON'T YOU JUMP ?
OH, J.B.
A VERY ATTRACTIVE GIRL,
MISS LaRUE.
YES, SHE IS.
I WAS JUST TRYING
TO PUT HER AT EASE.
SHE'S A VERY SHY PERSON.
YES.  WELL, YOU JUST
GO AHEAD, J.B.
I'M MEETING MOTHER
FOR DINNER.
MOTHER JUST LOVES
HAVING DINNER WITH ME.
I TELL HER EVERYTHING
THAT HAPPENS ALL DAY
AT THE OFFICE.
?? NOW HE'S THINKING ??
?? THE KID COULD REALLY
PUT ME THROUGH HELL ??
?? AND SHE'S THINKING ??
?? THE KID COULD EVEN
NAME THE HOTEL ??
?
?? NOW HE'S THINKING ??
?? I WONDER
IF HE'D DARE ?
?? AND SHE'S THINKING ??
?? THERE'S BLACKMAIL
IN THE AIR ??
?? AND HE SAYS ??
IT'S A HOLDUP.
?? AND SHE SAYS ??
DOWN !
WAIT A MINUTE.
OKAY, YOU'RE PROMOTED.
?
?? WELL, IT'S BEEN A LONG
BEEN A LONG, BEEN A LONG ?
?? BEEN A LONG DAY ??
?
?? WELL, IT'S BEEN A LONG
BEEN A LONG, BEEN A LONG ?
?? BEEN A LONG DAY ????
HAH !
REALLY, I MEAN IT.
YOU'VE GOTTA SEE THIS.
THIS IS MY OLDER SISTER,
BERNICE.
THE ONE THAT GOT MARRIED
AT 17.  AND THAT'S SAM
AND THE SEVEN CHILDREN.
YES.  PRETTY.
SEVEN !
TOO MANY ?
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.
NOT ENOUGH ?
NO, I DIDN'T SAY
ANYTHING--
YOU DON'T LIKE CHILDREN.
ACTUALLY, I COME FROM A
RATHER LARGE FAMILY MYSELF.
I KNOW.  SIX.
HOW'D YOU KNOW THAT ?
SMITTY HAD YOUR PERSONNEL FILE
OUT, AND, UH, SHE WAS JUST
CHECKING OFF A FEW--
MAYBE WE BETTER ORDER.
HUH ?
MAYBE WE BETTER ORDER.
OKAY.
ACTUALLY, IT'S INCUMBENT
ON BIG CORPORATIONS TO FIND
BRIGHT, YOUNG MEN.
I SUPPOSE YOU'RE RIGHT.
BUT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT,
BECAUSE ONCE--
HOW DO YOU LIKE
THOSE VEGETABLES ?
WELL, IT'S DELICIOUS.
I DO MY CARROTS IN A BOUILLON
WITH JUST A DOLLOP
OF WORCESTERSHIRE.
DOLLOP ?
JUST GREAT.  I WOULD REALLY
LOVE YOU TO HAVE IT SOMETIME.
WHAT WAS I TALKING ABOUT ?
BEFORE THE DOLLOP.
YOU TAKE THE AVERAGE YOUNG
PERSON TODAY.  THE TROUBLE
IS THEY'RE LOOKING FOR...
INSTANT POETRY,
INSTANT PSYCHOANALYSIS,
INSTANT MASHED POTATOES...
AND INSTANT
OLD-FASHIONED LOVE.
I MEAN, THEY DON'T REALIZE
THAT IT TAKES--
TAKES, UH, TIME TO ESTABLISH
A MEANINGFUL RELATIONSHIP.
DON'T YOU AGREE ?
WELL, NO.  I AGREE WITH
SOME OF THAT, ROSEMARY.
BUT IN THE WORLD OF BUSINESS,
I-- I SEE NO REASON...
WHY A PERSON HAS TO WAIT YEARS
TO BECOME A SUCCESS.
I DON'T KNOW.  IN THE WORLD
OF BUSINESS WHERE OLDER
AND MORE SOPHISTICATED--
WHAT'S THE MATTER ?
THIS IS WHERE I LIVE.
OH !
I'VE GOT MY KEY
IN HERE SOMEPLACE.
HERE YOU GO.
THERE.
THANK YOU.
OH, YOU BETTER GIVE ME THOSE.
THAT HAS THE KEY TO MY DESK,
AND I LOST IT TWICE...
...IN THE LAST--
OH, HERE, HERE.
LET ME.  LET ME GET THOSE.
THANK YOU.  I LOVE TO CURL UP
IN BED WITH A GOOD MAGAZINE.
DON'T YOU ?
ROSEMARY, THIS IS
THE DARNDEST THING !
YOU'RE THE FIRST GIRL
THAT I'VE MET THAT I--
THAT I FEEL I CAN TRUST.
ANYONE WHO CAN CURL UP IN BED
WITHFORTUNEANDBUSINESS WEEK--
WELL, THAT'S SUBSTANCE.
THANK YOU.
LISTEN, I WANNA--
HERE.  I WANNA THANK YOU
FOR A VERY STIMULATING EVENING.
I DON'T KNOW.  I'VE BEEN
ENJOYING MYSELF SO MUCH THAT
I FORGOT THAT I WAS DEPRESSED.
DEPRESSED ABOUT WHAT ?
I'VE BEEN WORKING SO HARD,
TRYING TO DO MY BEST,
AND I DON'T EVEN HAVE
MY OWN OFFICE YET.
YOU'VE ONLY BEEN
WORKING THERE TWO DAYS.
YES, BUT...
I FEEL I'M NEVER
GONNA GET ANY PLACE.
SOME MEN SPEND YEARS TRYING
TO ACCOMPLISH WHAT YOU'VE
JUST DONE IN TWO DAYS.
YES, BUT I'M 27 YEARS OLD,
AND I'M ONLY
A JUNIOR EXECUTIVE.
I'M NOT GETTING ANY YOUNGER.
YOU'VE GOT A WONDERFUL CAREER
AHEAD OF YOU.
OH, NO.
I'VE LOST THE VISION.
WELL, I HAVEN'T.
NOW, YOU LISTEN TO ME,
J. PIERREPONT FINCH.
?? YOU HAVE ??
?? THE COOL ??
?? CLEAR EYES ??
?? OF A SEEKER
OF WISDOM AND TRUTH ??
?? YET THERE'S
THAT UPTURNED CHIN ??
?? AND THE GRIN
OF IMPETUOUS YOUTH ??
?? OH, I BELIEVE IN YOU ??
?? I BELIEVE IN YOU ??
?? I HEAR THE SOUND ??
?? OF GOOD SOLID JUDGEMENT ??
?? WHENEVER YOU TALK ??
?? YET THERE'S
THE BOLD, BRAVE ??
?? SPRING OF A TIGER
THAT QUICKENS YOUR WALK ??
?? OH, I BELIEVE IN YOU ??
?? I BELIEVE IN YOU ??
?? AND WHEN MY FAITH
IN MY FELLOW MAN ??
?? ALL BUT FALLS APART ??
?? I'VE BUT TO FEEL YOUR HAND
GRASPING MINE ??
?? AND I TAKE HEART ??
?? I TAKE HEART ??
?? TO SEE ??
?? THE COOL, CLEAR EYES ??
?? OF A SEEKER
OF WISDOM AND TRUTH ??
?? YET WITH
THE SLAM-BANG TANG ??
?? REMINISCENT
OF GIN AND VERMOUTH ??
?? OH, I BELIEVE IN YOU ??
?? I BELIEVE IN YOU ????
ROSEMARY.
YES ?
YOU'VE GIVEN ME
A GREAT IDEA.

ABOUT THE BIG GAME TODAY.
I'M SORRY I HAVE TO MISS IT,
BUT, UH--  WE'RE PLAYING

YES.  I CAN'T MAKE IT EITHER.
I HOPE THOSE DAMNED CHIPMUNKS
DON'T GIVE US TOO MUCH TROUBLE.
NO, I THINK WE'LL TAKE 'EM,
SIR.  CHARNOWSKY'S KNEE,
YOU KNOW, IS--
IT'S MUCH BETTER.
YES, WITH CHARNOWSKY BACK, THE
TEAM'S MORALE SHOULD PICK UP.

I'M SORRY, SIR.
I JUST WANT TO,

"THINK, FINCH."
THINK FINCH, THINK FINCH.
WHERE ARE YOU HEADED FOR ?
WHAT'S YOUR AMBITION
IN THIS OUTFIT ?
SMART FELLOW LIKE YOU
MUST HAVE IT ALL FIGURED OUT.
SIR, I DON'T KNOW.
I'D LIKE TO BE
WHERE A MAN COULD GET
HIS TEETH INTO SOMETHING.
WHERE HE COULD, UH--
DO SOMETHING REAL,
SOLID, YOU KNOW--
DOWN-TO-EARTH.
I'D LIKE THE, UH,
ADVERTISING DEPARTMENT.
YES !
ADVERTISING ?
WOULDN'T DO FOR
AN OLD SCHOOLMATE OF MINE.
TOO ROUGH, TOO INSECURE.
OH.
WHY, WE'VE HAD 15
NEW ADVERTISING MANAGERS
HERE IN THE PAST YEAR ALONE.
THE POOR DEVILS DISAPPEAR
AT THE RATE OF ONE A MONTH.
WHY IS THAT ?
I FIRE 'EM.
BUT, SIR--
IF YOU HAD A MAN
WITH IDEAS--
IDEAS ?
THAT'S WHAT I LOOK FOR.
I KEEP HIRING A LOT
OF FELLOWS WHO ARE SUPPOSED
TO HAVE BRILLIANT IDEAS,

I'LL GET ON IT RIGHT AWAY.

WELL, THANK YOU.
WHAT DO YOU THINK ?
I MEAN IT'S-- IT'S--
IT'S NOT BAD CONSIDERING.
I DID WANT MY NAME

BUT I DECIDED NOT TO ASK,
'CAUSE THERE'S NO DOOR.
WELL, IT'S BEAUTIFUL,
AND IT'S YOURS.
OH, YES.
LISTEN, PONTY, I JUST CAME BY
TO TELL YOU THAT...
I HAD A REAL GOOD TIME
THE OTHER NIGHT.
OH, ME TOO.

THE CONVERSATION.
I GUESS

I KNOW IT WAS OUR FIRST DATE,
AND I DON'T WANT YOU TO GET
THE WRONG IMPRESSION,
BUT WELL,
I GUESS IT'S ONLY NATURAL
FOR A FELLA TO TRY TO GET
A LITTLE FRESH WITH A GIRL...
AND MAKE A PASS AT HER.
BUT YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING !
WELL, I HAD
TO GET UP EARLY--
SIR, UH, MISS--
I'M MISS LaRUE, HONEY.
YES, WELL, I DON'T, UH--
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU ?
A SECRETARY WAS ORDERED
TO BE ASSIGNED TO YOU.
I'M YOUR ASSIGNATION.
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME
YOU WERE GETTING A SECRETARY.
I JUST FOUND OUT MYSELF.

MISS LaRUE--
OH, JUST CALL ME HEDY.
WELL, YES, BUT I THINK
THAT PERHAPS, YOU KNOW,
IN A BUSINESS
RELATIONSHIP--
YOU'RE CUTE.
EXCUSE ME A MOMENT.
CHOOSING A SECRETARY CAN BE
FRAUGHT WITH PERIL.
TAKE A GOOD LOOK
AT THE YOUNG LADY WHO
HAS BEEN ASSIGNED TO YOU.
IF SHE IS SO ATTRACTIVE
THAT YOU FEEL THINGS
ARE TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE,
BE VERY CAREFUL.
IT MAY BE THAT ONE OF
THE BIG MEN IN THE COMPANY
IS INTERESTED IN HER CAREER.
THERE'S A SIMPLE TEST FOR THIS:
CHECK ON HER SECRETARIAL SKILL.
THE SMALLER HER ABILITIES,
THE BIGGER HER PROTECTOR.
YES.
UH, MISS LaRUE,
LET'S TRY SOME DICTATION.
TAKE A LETTER FOR ME.
SHOOT.
YES, UH, THIS IS
TO MR. GATCH.
UH, "DEAR...
MISTER... GATCH.

WHEN I TYPE.
OH, I SEE.
OH, YOU TYPE FAST, HUH ?
LIKE A JACKRABBIT.
TWELVE WORDS A MINUTE.
MISS LaRUE.  HEDY.
TELL ME SOMETHING.
I'D LIKE TO KNOW.
WHAT-- NOW-- WHAT--
WAS YOUR LAST...
POSITION ?
HMM ?
I WAS IN THE TOBACCO BUSINESS.
IN THE TOBACCO BUSINESS.
- BUT THEN MR. BIGGLEY...
- MR. BIGGLEY ?
WAS INTERESTED IN WICKETS,
SO I MATRICULATED MYSELF
INTO BUSINESS SCHOOLING.
WELL, HERE I AM.
OH, YES, YOU ARE.
YES, YES.
GO AHEAD, DICTATE SOME MORE,
I'M GONNA LIKE THIS JAZZ.
MISS LaRUE.  HEDY.
LOOK, PUT THE LETTER
ASIDE FOR A MOMENT.
I WANT YOU TO DO ME A FAVOR.
I HAVE A VERY IMPORTANT
JOB FOR YOU NOW.
OH, GOOD !
I WANT YOU TO TAKE THIS
IN TO MR. GATCH.
MR. GATCH.
NOW, MR. GATCH,
HE'S MY BOSS.
Y-YEAH.
WAIT A MINUTE.
I WANT YOU TO GIVE IT...

ALL RIGHT, HEDY ?
DID YOU GET THAT ?
FINE.
H-HEDY !

MISS, UH--
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING TONIGHT ?
I'VE GOT
A DATE WITH MY GENTLEMAN FRIEND.
OH, COME ON.  YOU'RE
IN THE BIG TIME NOW.
DON'T FOOL AROUND
WITH SMALL FRY.

IT'S THE
PRODUCTION DEPARTMENT.
OH.

I'M RUNNING EXECUTIVE
PERSONNEL PLACEMENT
DEPARTMENT NOW.
OH, Y-YOU WANT TO SPEAK
TO MR. GATCH ?
WELL, UH--
NO, HE'S BEEN TRANSFERRED...
TO ONE OF OUR--
OUR OUT-OF-TOWN OFFICES.
VENEZUELA.
VERY WELL.  IT IS TIME TO LOOK
TO YOUR NEXT STEP UP THE LADDER.
THIS IS AN IMPORTANT STEP.
WEIGH CAREFULLY
THE NEXT POSITION
YOU WANT TO OBTAIN.
MISS KRUMHOLTZ,
TAKE A MEMO FOR ME,
PLEASE.
YES, I WAS JUST
STRAIGHTENING UP YOUR DESK.
THAT'LL WAIT.
THIS IS AN INTEROFFICE
MEMO TO ALL DEPARTMENTS:
"WE ARE REASSIGNING...
"MR. J. PIERREPONT FINCH
TO THE WORLD WIDE WICKET
ADVERTISING DEPARTMENT.
SIGNED, UH, MANAGER,

WHO THE HELL PUT THROUGH
THIS ASSIGNMENT ?
I DIDN'T ORDER ANY HELP.
WHO ARE YOU, ANYWAY ?
WELL, UH, FINCH, SIR.
J. PIERREPONT FINCH.
IAM THE ONE WHO DECIDES
IF THIS DEPARTMENT NEEDS
REPLACEMENT PERSONNEL.
AND IF I NEED THEM,
I PICK THEM.  ME.  PERSONALLY.

ARE YOU LISTENING ?

I HEARD EVERY WORD, SIR.
WHO THE HELL TRANSFERRED
YOU INTO THIS DEPARTMENT ?
WELL, IT WAS THE MANAGER OF
EXECUTIVE PERSONNEL PLACEMENT.
WHO IS HE ?
WHAT'S HIS NAME ?
NO !  HE--
SIR, HE'S NOT THERE ANYMORE.
HE'S BEEN, UH--
TRANSFERRED TO--
DAMN SYSTEM.
DAMN
CORPORATE PROCEDURES.
I AGREE WITH YOU, MR. OVINGTON.
WHY, IT'S CRIMINAL
THE WAY THEY SHIFT PERSONNEL
WITHOUT CHECKING.
BUT I JUST WANTED TO SAY
SINCE THEY HAVE MADE THIS--
THIS DREADFUL REASSIGNMENT,
I PROMISE YOU I'LL--
I PROMISE.
I'LL DO MY BEST...
TO MAKE YOU HAPPY
WITH ME, SIR.
OH, REALLY.
...PLANNED SO THAT
IT WILL TAKE IN ALL COUNTRIES
IN EUROPE AND THE NEAR EAST.
HEDY ?
PERSONALLY.
OKAY, CHARLIE.
HELLO THERE.
WHO SENT YOU WITH THIS ?
WHAT HAPPENED ?
HE WANTS TO SEE YOU.
PERSONALLY.
SIT DOWN, FINCH.
OH.  THANK YOU, SIR.
YES ?
FINCH, I'VE BEEN WATCHING YOU
FOR THESE LAST TWO DAYS.
OH, WELL--
WOULD YOU LIKE TO KNOW
MY APPRAISAL OF YOU ?
WELL, YES, I WOULD, SIR.
FINCH, YOU REMIND ME OF MYSELF
WHEN I WAS A YOUNG MAN.
WELL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
SO BEFORE YOU TRY
TO TAKE OVER MY JOB,
I'M FIRING YOU.
- FIRING ME ?
- I'VE PUT THE PAPERS THROUGH
AND NOTIFIED PERSONNEL.
YOU'LL GET THE NORMAL
TWO WEEKS SEVERANCE PAY.
OH, AND THE PARTY.
I'VE SCHEDULED YOUR FAREWELL
PARTY FOR TOMORROW AFTERNOON
ON THE ROOFTOP GARDEN.
WELL, I BELIEVE
THAT'S EVERYTHING, FINCH.
YOU MAY SPEND THE REST
OF THE AFTERNOON CLEANING OUT
YOUR PERSONAL BELONGINGS.
GOOD-BYE, FINCH.
UH, DON'T YOU FEEL--
GOOD-BYE.
FINCH.
PONTY, I'M TERRIBLY SORRY.
I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.
HE JUST FIRED ME.
JUST LIKE THAT.
EVERYONE IS JUST SHOCKED.
ABSOLUTELY STUNNED.
YOU WERE ADVANCING SO NICELY.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT.
DO YOU KNOW, HE WAS SO
DISPASSIONATE AND COLD.
HE'S--  OH.
HE'S THE ONLY ONE
THAT I COULD NEVER
GET AN ANGLE ON.
LOOK.  LOOK, YOU'RE
HIS SECRETARY.
YOU MUST KNOW...
ONE WEAKNESS THAT HE
HAS, SOME LITTLE ANGLE
THAT I COULD WORK ON.
PONTY, I SWEAR TO YOU,
WE HARDLY KNOW HIM.
NO ONE KNOWS
ANYTHING ABOUT HIM.
HE'S THE COMPANY MYSTERY MAN.
BUT, HEY, WHAT ABOUT
HIS PERSONAL PHONE CALLS ?
NO, NO, NO.
HE HAS A PRIVATE TELEPHONE
HE KEEPS LOCKED UP IN A CABINET,
AND HIS PERSONAL PHONE CALLS
NEVER GO THROUGH ME
OR THE SWITCHBOARD.
PONTY, YOU'D HAVE TO BE
A FLY ON THE WINDOWSILL
TO LEARN ANYTHING ABOUT HIM.
BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT I'D DO ANYTHING
IN THE WORLD TO HELP.
SAY THAT AGAIN.
I SAID I'D DO
ANYTHING IN THE WORLD
TO HELP YOU.
NO, BEFORE THAT.
WHAT DID YOU SAY ?
I SAID,
"YOU'D HAVE TO BE A FLY
ON HIS WINDOWSILL."
YEAH.
IT SHOULD BE DE-ACCENTUATED.
I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED IN YOU.
HE MISSED
THE WHOLE POINT.
HE ALWAYS DOES.
HERE'S A NEW APPROACH
TO WHAT WE'VE BEEN SAYING.
WELL, THAT IS MORE--
OH, GENTLEMEN, WOULD YOU LEAVE
ME ALONE FOR A FEW MOMENTS ?
WE'LL BE OUTSIDE, BURTON,
IF YOU NEED US.
- HELLO ?  YES ?

-BEEN WAITING FOR YOUR CALL.
YES, TONIGHT.

I'LL SEE YOU
RIGHT AFTER WORK.
TOODLE-OO.

I KNOW THAT.
FINCH, IT'S A GOOD THING
YOU'RE ON THE BALL WHEN
IT COMES TO ADVERTISING.
WHAT ARE WE
GONNA DO FOR A NEW
ADVERTISING MANAGER ?
FINCH, IT COULD BE FATE
THAT YOU DISCOVERED THIS
BEFORE OVINGTON FIRED YOU.
WHY, SIR ?
YOU'VE ALWAYS WANTED
THIS ROTTEN JOB.
YOU THINK
YOU CAN HANDLE IT ?
WELL, I-- I DON'T KNOW, SIR.
I'VE NEVER HAD--
IF THERE'S ONE THING I ADMIRE
IN A MAN, IT IS HUMILITY !
UM, WELL, HMM.

FINCH, I GUESS
I OWE YOU AN APOLOGY.
Y-YOU DO, SIR ?
FOR WHAT ?
NEVER MIND.
I WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT I DO NOT APPROVE...
OF WHAT YOU WERE DOING
WHEN I WALKED IN.
I DON'T CARE FOR THAT BETWEEN
AN EXECUTIVE AND HIS SECRETARY.
BUT MISS PILKINGTON
WON'T BE MY SECRETARY
UNTIL MONDAY.
THAT'S A GOOD POINT !
YOU CAN COME OUT
NOW, GIRLS.
ROSEMARY, I WANT
TO THANK YOU SO--
I WANT TO THANK YOU
FOR--
ROSEMARY,
WHERE ARE YOU GOING ?
I NEVER WANT TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
ROSEMARY, COME HERE.  LISTEN.
YOU'RE GOING TO BE MY SECRETARY.
I WOULDN'T BE YOUR SECRETARY
IF WILD HORSES DRAGGED ME.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT ?
I'LL TAKE THE JOB !
HEDY, HEDY.
I WOULD LOVE THAT.
I REALLY WOULD.
BUT ROSEMARY'S GOING
TO BE MY SECRETARY.
NOW, LISTEN TO ME.
HEY.
I CAN EXPLAIN EVERYTHING
LATER ABOUT HEDY.
ABOUT EVERYTHING.
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND ?
I'VE JUST BEEN MADE
VICE PRESIDENT.
IN CHARGE OF ADVERTISING.
NOW, YOU KNOW WHAT
A TOUGH JOB THAT IS.
HEY !
AND I CAN ONLY DO IT
IF I HAVE YOUR HELP.
ROSEMARY, I NEED YOU.
WELL, WHEN YOU
PUT IT THAT WAY--
GUESS I'LL WAIT
FOR THAT PIGEON TILL
AFTER HE'S MARRIED.
SURE A LOT OF
WHISPERING GOING ON.
IT'S
THE MERCHANDISE MAFIA AT WORK.
EVER SINCE FINCH BECAME
VICE PRESIDENT, THEY'RE ALL
SCARED OUT OF THEIR WITS.
THEY CAN'T WAIT FOR HIM
TO LAY AN EGG.
WHAT TIME IS THE BIG
MEETING THIS AFTERNOON ?
SO, YOU ARE NOW
A VICE PRESIDENT.
YOU HAVE CLIMBED
THE LADDER OF SUCCESS,
RUNG BY PAINFUL RUNG,
UNTIL YOU'VE ALMOST
SCALED THE TOP.
YOU HAVE DONE BEAUTIFULLY--
UNLESS YOU ARE VICE PRESIDENT
IN CHARGE OF ADVERTISING.
IN THAT CASE,
YOU'RE IN TERRIBLE TROUBLE.
THERE IS ONE THING
THAT CAN SAVE YOU.
YOU MUST GET
A BRILLIANT IDEA.
NOW, THE QUICKEST WAY
TO GET A BRILLIANT IDEA...
IS TO STEAL
SOMEONE ELSE'S !
HI, PONTY.
I HAD TO TALK TO YOU.
- HI, BUD.
- HEY, FIRST TIME
I'VE SEEN YOUR NEW OFFICE.
HEY, QUITE A LAYOUT.
MY FAVORITE STYLE.
CHINESE PROVINCIAL.
PONTY, I WANT YOU AND ME
TO BE FRIENDS.
OH, BUD.  NOW, COME ON.
YOU KNOW,
"SMOKE-UM PEACE PIPE."
OH, LOOK, WOULD YOU--
YOU NEVER LIKED ME.
BUD, NOW DON'T--
DON'T DENY IT.
IT'S TRUE, AND
I DON'T BLAME YOU.
I'VE BEEN A NO-GOOD,
BACKBITING FINK !
OH, NOW BUD, COME ON.
I THINK THAT PUTS IT
A BIT STRONG.
HOW WOULD YOU PUT IT ?
I GUESS
YOUR WAY IS BEST.
I WANT TO CHANGE ALL THAT.
NOW, I KNOW YOU'RE STUCK
FOR AN IDEA, SO--
I--  WAIT A MINUTE !
I'M NOT STUCK FOR AN IDEA.
I KNOW YOU'RE STUCK
FOR AN IDEA.
YOU'RE STUCK FOR AN IDEA,
AND I WAS THINKING THAT
GIVEAWAY SHOWS ARE COMING BACK.
I DON'T NEED ANYONE ELSE'S IDEA.
WHAT DID YOU SAY ABOUT
A GIVEAWAY SHOW ?
I HAVE THIS DANDY IDEA
FOR A GIVEAWAY PROGRAM.
A GIVEAWAY PROGRAM.
YEAH.  IT'S CALLED
THE WORLD WIDE WICKET
TREASURE HUNT.
A TREASURE HUNT.
WE HIDE A $1,000
SAVINGS BOND SOMEWHERE.
AND EACH WEEK
ON TELEVISION, WE GIVE CLUES
TO WHERE IT'S HIDDEN.
LOOK, LIKE YOU SAY,
YOU DON'T NEED AN IDEA.
NO, I DON'T NEED IT.
LET ME LEAVE IT WITH YOU,
AND IF YOU GET A CHANCE,
LOOK IT OVER.
YEAH.
BECAUSE THE MEETING'S
IN A FEW LITTLE WHILE.
I MEAN, IT'S SOON.
WHAT DID YOUR UNCLE SAY
WHEN, UM-- WHEN YOU TOLD
IT TO HIM ?
I HAVEN'T TOLD IT TO J.B.
IF I BROUGHT IT TO HIM,
HE WOULDN'T LISTEN.
THAT'S WHY
I BROUGHT IT TO YOU.
YOU NEVER MENTIONED THIS
TO YOUR UNCLE AT ALL ?
NO, PONTY.
BUT HOW CAN I BELIEVE THAT ?
AN IDEA LIKE THIS ?
NO, PONTY.
IF YOU'RE NOT INTERESTED,
THAT'S ONE THING--
NO, ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT, I'LL--
HMM.
WELL, I'LL GIVE IT
A BIT OF A THINK THING.
MULL IT AROUND A BIT.
FEEL FREE TO USE IT.
"TREASURE HUNT."
ARE YOU PREGNANT
OR SOMETHING ?
HEDY, I TOLD
YOU NEVER TO COME--
I DID NOT INTEND
TO EMBARRASS YOU, I JUST
CAME FOR A BUSINESS PURPOSE.
BUSINESS ?
I WISH TO TENDER YOU
WITH MY RESIGNATION.
YOUR RESIGNATION ?
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
HEDY !
YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME.
J.B., J.B., J.B. !
OH, I'M SORRY.
WHAT THE HELL
DO YOU WANT ?
J.B., DO YOU REMEMBER
THAT TELEVISION IDEA
I TOLD YOU ABOUT,
THE TREASURE HUNT ?
I'VE TOLD YOU WHAT I THOUGHT
OF THAT STUPID IDEA.
I JUST WANTED TO REMIND YOU
THAT YOU HATED IT.
OUT !
YOU DO HATE IT.
I'M GOING, I'M GOING, I'M GOING.
I SAID, OUT !
NOW, WHAT IS THIS
RESIGNATION NONSENSE ?
WHERE ARE YOU GOING ?
I DON'T KNOW.
ALL I KNOW IS, I AM
CLEARING OUT OF HERE !
I AM BEGINNING TO ROT IN
THAT SECRETARIAL POOL.
NOT ONE PERSON WILL
USE ME AS HIS SECRETARY.
THEY STAY AWAY FROM ME,
LIKE I HAD AN EXTREMELY
TROPICAL DISEASE.
JUST BE PATIENT.  I PROMISE
WE'LL FIND A SPOT FOR YOU.
PROMISES, PROMISES, PROMISES.
BUT NO ACTION.
NO, NO, NO.
I AM FED UP WITH
THAT SECRETARIAL POOL.
I'LL GIVE YOU
IT'S GOOD-BYE WICKETS,
HELLO SOMEBODY
WHO CAN DO ME
SOMETHING FOR REAL !
HEDY, ON MY WORD OF HONOR
AS A GENTLEMAN,
I PROMISE YOU'LL BE OUT
OF THAT SECRETARIAL POOL
BY TOMORROW !
YOU BETTER, OR ELSE !
EXECUTIVE WASHROOM.
YEAH, WE'RE ALL DOWN HERE.
THE MEETING'S AT 4:30.
COME ON DOWN.
WE'LL MAKE PLANS.
BIG MEETING TODAY,
HUH ?
HEAR ANYTHING ABOUT
WHAT FINCH IS PLANNING ?
J.B. SET THE BOARD MEETING,
SO HE MUST HAVE
COME UP WITH SOMETHING.
YOU KNOW, FELLAS,
I'M GETTING A LITTLE
AFRAID OF FINCH.
ME TOO.  IF WE DON'T
STOP HIM, PRETTY SOON--
HE'LL PROBABLY HAVE US ALL
WORKING IN THE MAIL ROOM.
GOOD LUCK TO US.
HI, MEN !
HELLO, BUD.
HI, BUD.
DID YOU HEAR ANYTHING ?
CHAPS,
OUR WORRIES ARE OVER.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN ?
OH, I'M SO HAPPY I COULD CRY !
FINCH IS GOING AHEAD WITH--
WHAT ?
WELL, BELIEVE ME,
HE'S DEAD, DEAD, DEAD.
OH, I'M GLAD
TO HEAR THAT.
I DON'T KNOW.
FINCH HAS A WAY OF BOUNCING.
I WOULDN'T BELIEVE HE WAS DEAD
EVEN IF I READ HIS OBITUARY.
OH, YOU MAY BE RIGHT.
ORDINARILY,
I'D AGREE WITH YOU.
FINCH IS VERY SMART.
BUT LET'S NOT FORGET THAT

GOOD AFTERNOON.
UH, THANK YOU.
GENTLEMEN,
I'D LIKE TO PRESENT...
MY NEW APPROACH
TO WICKET ADVERTISING,
WHICH IN MY HUMBLE OPINION--
I THINK IT'S BRILLIANT !
SOUNDS PROMISING.
PROCEED, FINCH.
THANK YOU.
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT ?
THAT IS A PICTURE
OF MOUNT VESUVIUS
IN ERUPTION,
WHICH GIVES YOU THE IMPACT
THAT OUR NEW TELEVISION SHOW
IS GOING TO HAVE.
NOW, J.B., THE TYPE
OF NATIONAL PUBLICITY
THAT YOU...
AND, WELL, YOU ALONE
CAN LOOK FORWARD TO:
THE COVER OFTIMEMAGAZINE.
OH, YES, YES !
YES, AND THE COVER
OFNEWSWEEK.
DELIGHTFUL !
AND FINALLY, J.B.,
THE GOLFER OF THE YEAR.
BRAVO, J.B.,
YOU'VE DONE IT AGAIN.
THANK YOU.
NOW, GENTLEMEN,
THIS IS A MAP OF
THE POTENTIAL WICKET MARKET.
IT'S DIVIDED INTO
SOCIAL, GEOGRAPHIC
AND ETHNIC GROUPS.
ETHNIC ?
ETHNIC.
IT SHOWS HOW...
WE WILL MAKE DEEP PENETRATION,
OVERWHELMING SATURATION
INTO THOSE AREAS...
WHICH HAVE LONG REMAINED,
UH, PEAKIEST !
I LIKE THIS THINKING !
NOW, THIS IS A SALES CHART.
THIS IS A SALES CHART
OF THE PAST FISCAL YEAR,
WHICH REFLECTS
THE DISASTROUS EFFECT OF OUR
FORMER ADVERTISING POLICY...
IN TERMS OF PER CAPITA
CONSUMPTION OF WICKETS.
NOTE, GENTLEMEN,
THE SHARP DECLINE
FROM NORMAL REGULARITY.
DOWN, DOWN, DOWN.
BUT THIS IS WHAT'S GOING
TO HAPPEN TO OUR SALES...
AFTER MY NEW TELEVISION PROGRAM
SEEPS INTO THE PUBLIC MIND.
-
- UP, UP, UP !
UP, UP, UP.
AND THERE YOU HAVE IT.
WHOO !
FINCH, I THINK YOU'VE
DONE IT.  VERY GOOD.
THANK YOU, SIR.
YES, YES, YES.
CAN I ASK A QUESTION,
J.B. ?
NOT "CAN I," DAMN IT, "MAY I."
YOU WENT TO COLLEGE.
MAYI ASK A QUESTION ?
YOU MAY.
WHAT'S HIS IDEA ?
YOU HEARD.  IT'S A TELEVISION
SHOW, DESIGNED TO GIVE US
PENETRATION AND PEAK REACTION.
DON'T YOU EVER LISTEN ?
SOUNDS GREAT, FINCH, GREAT.
DOESN'T IT, MEN ?
BUT WHAT IS HISIDEA
FOR THE SHOW ?
I DON'T SEE WHY
YOU HAVE TO BE
SO DAMNED NEGATIVE.
THE ONLY THINGS YOU EVER
COME UP WITH ARE LOUSY IDEAS
LIKE TREASURE HUNTS !
ALL RIGHT, FINCH,
WHAT IS THE IDEA FOR THE SHOW ?
I DON'T THINK I'M GOING
TO TELL IT TO YOU.
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN ?
- YOU KNOW, J.B.,
LOOK, I'VE--
I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT OF YOU
AS A MAN OF, UH--
A MAN OF
PERSPICACITY AND VISION.
OPEN TO NEW IDEAS !
BUT NOW I--
I DON'T KNOW.
I'M THROWN.
BY WHAT ?
THE WAY YOU TALKED TO BUD !
ABOUT HIS IDEA.
FOR A TREASURE HUNT.
YOU DISMISSED IT.
THERE ARE TREASURE HUNTS
AND TREASUREHUNTS.
AND AT FIRST--  AT FIRST
I THOUGHT BUD'S IDEA...
WAS A ROTTEN IDEA
MYSELF.
BUT GENTLEMEN,
IN THE FIELD OF MEDICINE,
THERE WERE MEN LIKE...
HIPPOCRATES, UH,
LOUIS PASTEUR,
SIGMUND FREUD,
JONAS SALK.
GENTLEMEN, THEY ALL HAD
BRILLIANT IDEAS, BUT IT TOOK
MODERN TECHNOLOGY...
TO TAKE ALL THESE IDEAS
AND DEVELOP THEM INTO
A GREAT TELEVISION PROGRAM.
- LIKEDR. KILDARE.
-
THE PUBLIC ALWAYS LOVES
A SHOW WHERE SOMEONE
WINS A LOT OF MONEY.
AND THE FIRST ONE
WHO COMES UP WITH A--
WITH A NEW, AN UNRIGGED,
AN UNFIXED WAY TO GIVE AWAY
SOMETHING FOR NOTHING...
IS GOING TO SWEEP
THE AIRWAVES.
IT CAN'T BE DONE, J.B.
CAN'T BE DONE.
BUT IF IT COULD, J.B.
IF IT COULD.
WOULDN'T IT CREATE
TREMENDOUS EXCITEMENT ?
IT CAN'T BE DONE !
BUT IF IT COULD !
BUT IT CAN'T.
JUST FOR A MOMENT,
SAY, "IT COULD BE DONE."
NOW, WHAT IS YOUR ANSWER ?
I FORGOT THE QUESTION !
I HATE GIVEAWAY SHOWS.
THEY LACK DIGNITY.
PLEASE, BE PATIENT.
GENTLEMEN.
THE WORLD WIDE WICKET
TREASURE GIRL.
WHAT IS THIS ?
THIS IS THE
SECRET INGREDIENT.
IT CAN'T MISS.
I'M COMBINING GREED
WITH SEX.  GO AHEAD, HEDY.
HELLO THERE.

CLUE.
CLUE... TO WHERE
THE WORLD WIDE TREASURE
HAS BEEN STASHED.
BURIED !
BURIED TREASURE.
OH, YEAH.  BURIED.
THIS EYE PATCH
GETS ME MIXED UP.
J.B., MISS LaRUE IS,
WELL, SHE'S JUST
HELPING ME WITH THE IDEA.
SHE WILL NOT BE OUR
REGULAR TREASURE GIRL.
ACTUALLY,
WHEN WE GO ON THE AIR,
WE'RE GOING TO NEED A--
YOU KNOW, WE'LL NEED
A BIG NAME PERSONALITY.
SOMEONE LIKE, UH,
ELIZABETH TAYLOR.
WHY DON'T YOU GET
QUEEN ELIZABETH ?
THIS IS AN AMERICAN PROGRAM.
THIS IS INSANITY, J.B. !
LET'S TELL THIS MANIAC OFF
AND GET ON WITH BUSINESS !
I'LL HANDLE THIS.
WILL YOU GENTLEMEN
AND MISS LaRUE...
KINDLY LEAVE ME ALONE
WITH MR. FINCH.
I CAN EXPLAIN THIS, SIR.
I KNOW IT TAKES--
NOW, WAIT A MINUTE !
THAT'S NOT TRUE AT ALL.
BUT GENTLEMEN, UH, SIR--
GIVEAWAY SHOW.
I'LL HAVE TO MULL THIS OVER.
WHERE IS THE TREASURE
GOING TO BE HIDDEN ?
SIR, THIS IS A COMPLETELY
HONEST SHOW.  NOT EVEN
THE TREASURE GIRL...
IS GOING TO KNOW WHERE
THE TREASURE IS HIDDEN.
I MEAN, WHOEVER SHE MAY BE.
I'M THE ONLY ONE
THAT WILL KNOW, SIR.
AS PRESIDENT OF THE COMPANY,
DON'T YOU THINK I SHOULD KNOW ?
YES.  WELL, I'M GONNA HIDE
IN EACH OF THE TEN
WORLD WIDE WICKET BUILDINGS
THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.
NOW--
WELL, NOW YOU KNOW, SIR.
BUT IT JUST MUST BE
A SECRET BETWEEN YOU AND ME.
FINCH, YOU'RE A BRILLIANT
YOUNG MAN, BUT I'M AFRAID
YOU'VE LET US DOWN.
YOU'VE MISSED THE BOAT !
HAVEN'T THOUGHT
THIS OUT PROPERLY.
WHY, SIR ?
I DON'T--

TREASURE GIRL HAVE TO BE
A BIG-NAME PERSONALITY ?

WOULD YOU PLACE
YOUR RIGHT HAND
ON THE BIBLE, PLEASE ?
NO, YOUR OTHER
RIGHT HAND.
DO YOU SWEAR THERE
HAS BEEN NO FIXING OR RIGGING
IN CONNECTION WITH THIS SHOW ?
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH HER ?
SHE LOOKED
SURPRISED.
YES, SHE IS.
HEDY DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THIS.
I WANTED THIS PART OF THE SHOW
TO BE COMPLETELY SPONTANEOUS
AND SORT OF UNREHEARSED.
THAT CAN BE
VERY DANGEROUS.
DO YOU SWEAR THAT YOU
YOURSELF DO NOT KNOW...
WHERE THE TREASURE
IS ACTUALLY HIDDEN ?
IS THIS A REAL BIBLE ?
YES, THIS
IS A REAL BIBLE.
YOU SEE, WE'RE GOING
TO GET INTO TROUBLE.
WHY, J.B. ?  YOU AND I
ARE THE ONLY ONES WHO KNOW
WHERE THE TREASURE IS HIDDEN.
I MEAN, SHE DOESN'T KNOW,
DOES SHE ?
PLEASE.  TIME IS SLIPPING BY.
DOES SHE ?
UH, TREASURE GIRL.
THE ENTIRE NATION
IS WAITING.
-I'LL REPEAT THE QUESTION.
- NOBODY TOLD ME ABOUT THIS.
MISS TREASURE GIRL--
I DO NOT WISH
TO TAKE A BUM RAP.
MISS TREASURE GIRL--
MY MOMMY AND DADDY
TOLD ME NEVER...
TO SWEAR FALSE WITNESS
AGAINST PERJURY.
IDOKNOW WHERE
THE TREASURE IS HIDDEN.
I FOUND OUT LAST NIGHT !
THERE IS TREASURE HIDDEN IN ALL
THE WORLD WIDE WICKET BUILDINGS.
- RIGHT NOW.
-
PLEASE, FOLKS, COME BACK.
EVERYONE TAKE A SEAT.
SAM, STOP THAT !
WHAT ARE YOU DOING ?
IT'S ANOTHER TREASURE HUNTER.
THIS LITTLE CREEP TRIED
TO SNEAK PAST ME THREE TIMES !
TAKE YOUR HANDS OFF HIM !
I'M TERRIBLY SORRY, SIR.
THIS IS THE LITTLE CREEP
WHO HAPPENS TO BE
THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD.
CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD ?
THEY ALL LOOK ALIKE TO ME.
OH !
I'M VERY SORRY, MR. WOMPER.
IF YOU'LL COME WITH ME,
MR. BIGGLEY'S WAITING.
MISS JONES,
HAVE YOU SEEN PONTY ?
NO.
EVERYBODY'S LOOKING FOR HIM.
OH, POOR BABY.
I'VE GOT TO FIND HIM.
HE WAS A NICE BOY,
BUT SOMEBODY'S HEAD
HAS TO ROLL.
HOW TO HANDLE A DISASTER.
IN EVERY BUSINESSMAN'S CAREER,
THERE ARE TIMES WHEN
EVERYTHING GOES WRONG.
THIS IS A TIME
FOR MAINTAINING A COOL HEAD...
AND FOLLOWING
THE ONE, SIMPLE RULE:
PUT THE BLAME
ON SOMEBODY ELSE.
OH, PONTY !
I'VE BEEN WORRIED TO DEATH.
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT ?
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ?
I'VE BEEN JUST
WALKING THE STREETS.
I'VE JUST BEEN
THINKING, THINKING--
WELL--
OH, YOU'VE GOT
A BRUISE ON YOUR HEAD.
I KNOW !
I KNOW,
I GOT IT LAST NIGHT.
THEY--
WELL, THEY THREW ME
OUT OF A SALOON.
WHY'D THEY DO THAT ?
I DIDN'T BUY ANYTHING.
THE BRUTES.
OH, PONTY, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT ?
I WAS SO WORRIED, AND EVERYONE'S
LOOKING FOR YOU.
YES, I BET.
I'M GONNA
BE ALL RIGHT.
BUT BEFORE THEY FIND ME,
I HAVE TO READ UP ON HOW
TO HANDLE THIS DISASTER.
READ UP ?
WELL, WHAT DO YOU MEAN ?
WELL, I MIGHT AS WELL
TELL YOU.  SEE, BEFORE
I CAME TO THIS COMPANY,
I WAS A--
WHAT WERE YOU ?
I WAS A WINDOW WASHER.
THEN I CAME ACROSS
THIS BOOK.
HOW TO SUCCEED IN BUSINESS.
IT JUST MUST EXPLAIN
HOW TO PUT THE BLAME
ON SOMEONE ELSE.
OH, PONTY, YOU WOULDN'T.
THAT'S DISHONEST.
IT WAS YOUR IDEA.
YOU'VE GOT TO GO IN THERE
AND FACE THE MUSIC.
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT IT'S LIKE
IN BIG BUSINESS.
THEY-- THEY'D FIRE ME.
I'D HAVE TO GO BACK
TO WASHING WINDOWS.
PONTY, I COULDN'T LOVE
A MAN WHO WASN'T HONEST.
IF YOU DON'T
MAKE A CLEAN BREAST
OF EVERYTHING,
I'LL NEVER HAVE
ANY RESPECT FOR YOU.
ROSEMARY, LOOK.
IT'S NO LIFE FOR YOU,
BEING MARRIED TO A--
A WINDOW WASHER.
PONTY,
ARE YOU GONNA GO IN THERE
AND FACE THEM HONESTLY OR NOT ?
GOOD-BYE, PONTY.
ROSEMARY, WAIT !
ROSEMARY, WAIT !
ROSEMARY !
AHA !  FINCH, YOU'RE WANTED
IN J.B.'S OFFICE.
YEAH, WELL, I THOUGHT
I'D WASH UP FIRST.
THEY WANT YOU NOW.
THAT'S WHAT I FIGURED.
LET ME TELL YOU BEFORE WE GO
ANY FURTHER.  I'M THE PRESIDENT
OF THIS COMPANY,
THE MAN WHO'S RESPONSIBLE
FOR EVERYTHING
THAT GOES ON HERE.
I WANT TO STATE RIGHT NOW
THAT ANYTHING THAT HAPPENED
IS NOT MY FAULT !
THERE'S ONE BRIGHT SIDE
TO THIS THING, WALLY.
YOU'LL BE HAPPY
TO KNOW WE'VE SOMEONE
WE CAN PIN IT ON.
YOU'LL SOON SEE
WHERE THE RESPONSIBILITY
FOR THIS WHOLE THING LIES.
WHEN FINCH GETS HERE,
I'LL DO ALL THE TALKING.
THIS IS A VERY SLICK
YOUNGSTER, WALLY.
HERE HE IS NOW.
ALL RIGHT.
MR. BIGGLEY, PLEASE--
I'LL DO ALL THE TALKING.
BY THE WAY, YOU HAVEN'T MET
MR. WOMPER.  THIS IS
THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD.
HOW DO YOU DO, MR. WOMPER.
MR. WOMPER--
NO SPEECHES.
IT'S ALL SETTLED.
I WANT YOU TO SIGN
A LETTER OF RESIGNATION...
IN WHICH YOU ACCEPT
ALL THE BLAME
FOR WHAT HAPPENED.
ROSEMARY.
WHAT ?
ALL RIGHT, MR. BIGGLEY, I--
ALL RIGHT.  I'LL BE GLAD
TO SIGN THE RESIGNATION.
IS THIS ONE
OF YOUR TRICKS ?
NO, MR. BIGGLEY.
I'M THROUGH WITH ALL THAT.
TH-THIS FIRM HAS BEEN
PRETTY GOOD TO ME.
NOW, I'M JUST GOING TO RESIGN.
I'M GONNA TAKE THE BLAME...
AND GO BACK TO WHAT I DID
BEFORE I CAME HERE.
- WHAT DID YOU DO, FINCH ?
-
- I WAS A WINDOW WASHER.
- NO KIDDIN' !
I STARTED AS
A WINDOW WASHER MYSELF !
YOUWERE
A WINDOW WASHER ?
WHAT THE HELL
DID YOU THINK I WAS,
A RAIL-SPLITTER ?
COLLEGE MAN.
SO YOU WERE A WINDOW WASHER ?
CALL ME WALLY.
YES, MR. WOMPER.
OKAY, WALLY.
WHY DON'T YOU CALL ME PONTY ?
TELL ME, FINCH--
OKAY, PONTY.  IT'S BEEN
A LONG TIME SINCE I HAD ANYBODY
AROUND HERE I COULD TALK TO.
HOW'D YOU HAPPEN TO GO
INTO THIS BUSINESS ?
WELL, SIR--
LET ME TELL YA,
I HAD A BOOK--
ME TOO.
IT WAS A BOOK ON
HOW TO SUCCEED IN BUSINESS.
MY BOOK WAS MORE USEFUL.
I BOOKED BETS FOR ALL
THE OTHER WINDOW WASHERS.
CLEANED UP A BUNDLE.
SHOULD HAVE STOOD
IN THAT BUSINESS.
EIGHT BUILDINGS WRECKED,
OUR STOCK IS DOWN FIVE POINTS !
- WE'RE THE LAUGHINGSTOCK
OF THE INDUSTRY.
- UGH !  I KNOW, WALLY.
- IT'S GHASTLY.
- PONTY, HOW DID THIS HAPPEN ?
I COULD UNDERSTAND A COLLEGE MAN
PULLING A BONER LIKE THIS,
BUT NOT NO WINDOW WASHER !
NOW, THIS IDEA OF YOURS
ABOUT A TREASURE HUNT--
NOW, HOLD IT, WALLY.
LOOK, IF THERE'S ONE THING
THAT I WON'T DO,
IT'S TAKE CREDIT
FOR ANOTHER MAN'S IDEA.
ESPECIALLY WHEN
HE'S THE BOSS'S NEPHEW.
YOU NEVER TOLD ME
YOU HIRED YOUR NEPHEW.
NEPHEW ?  OH, NEPHEW.
HE'S NOT REALLY MY NEPHEW,
HE'S MY WIFE'S NEPHEW.
I NEVER SHOWED HIM
ANY FAVORITISM.
IN FACT, I HATE HIM.
BUT YOU LOVE HIS IDEAS.
NO, WHEN HE TOLD ME THE IDEA,
I THOUGHT IT WAS A LOUSY IDEA.
WHEN FINCH BROUGHT IT
TO ME, I STILL SAID
IT WAS A LOUSY IDEA.
IN FACT, I TOLD FINCH
IT WAS A LOUSY IDEA !
WHY DID YOU BUY IT ?
SEEMED LIKE A GOOD IDEA.
TREASURE HUNT,
TREASURE GIRL.
FINCH DRESSED IT ALL UP.
HE CAN'T DENY THAT THE IDEA
OF THE TREASURE GIRL...
WAS HIS !
WALLY, THAT WAS MY IDEA.
AND NOT A BAD ONE,
PONTY.
BUT WHO THE HELL PICKED
THAT BUBBLE-HEADED TOMATO ?
AHA !
DON'T GET ANY WRONG IDEAS,
WALLY.  SHE'S A FINE GIRL.
YOU SHOULD HAVE
A TALK WITH HER.
I INTEND TO.
WELL, I THINK I GOT
THE WHOLE PICTURE.
NOW, THE QUESTION
IS WHAT TO DO
AND WHO TO DO IT TO.
WALLY, BEFORE YOU MAKE
ANY HASTY DECISIONS, I'D--
WELL, I'D LIKE TO SAY
A FEW WORDS.
ABOUT WHAT ?
ABOUT, WELL--
ABOUT HUMANITY.
OH !
NO, LOOK, EVEN THOUGH
WE'RE ALL PART OF
THE COLD, CORPORATE SETUP,
DEEP DOWN UNDER OUR SKINS
THERE'S FLESH AND BLOOD.
- WE'RE ALL BROTHERS.
- BUT SOME OF US ARE UNCLES !
?? NOW YOU MAY JOIN
THE ELKS, MY FRIEND ??
?? AND I MAY JOIN
THE SHRINERS ??
?? AND OTHER MEN
MAY CARRY CARDS ??
?? AS MEMBERS
OF THE DINERS ??
?? STILL OTHERS WEAR
A GOLDEN KEY ??
?? OR SMALL
GREEK LETTER PIN ??
?? BUT I HAVE LEARNED
THERE'S ONE GREAT CLUB ??
?? THAT ALL OF US ARE IN ??
?? THERE IS
A BROTHERHOOD ??
?? OF MAN ??
??
?? A BENEVOLENT BROTHERHOOD
?? OF MAN ??
?? A NOBLE TIE THAT BINDS ??
?? ALL HUMAN HEARTS
AND MINDS ??
?? INTO A BROTHERHOOD OF MAN ??
?? YOUR LIFELONG MEMBERSHIP ??
?? IS FREE ??
?? KEEP A-GIVIN'
EACH BROTHER ALL ??
?? YOU CAN ??
?? OH, AREN'T
YOU PROUD TO BE ??
?? IN THAT FRATERNITY ??
?? THE GREAT BIG
BROTHERHOOD OF MAN ??
NOW, WALLY, I WANT YOU
TO REMEMBER THAT BEFORE
YOU CONSIDER FIRING MR. BIGGLEY.
WHO'S CONSIDERING THAT ?
GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE !
YOU SEE, I KNOW WHAT'S
ON YOUR MIND.  YOU'D LIKE
TO CLEAR OUT THE WHOLE PLACE.
FROM TOP TO BOTTOM.
IT'S THE OBVIOUS MOVE,
BUT STOP AND THINK.
?? ONE MAN
MAY SEEM INCOMPETENT ??
?? ANOTHER NOT MAKE SENSE ??
?? WHILE OTHERS LOOK
LIKE QUITE A WASTE ??
?? OF COMPANY EXPENSE ??
?? THEY NEED
A BROTHER'S LEADERSHIP ??
?? SO PLEASE
DON'T DO THEM IN ??
?? REMEMBER MEDIOCRITY ??
?? IS NOT A MORTAL SIN ??
?? THEY'RE... IN... THE
??
?? WE'RE... IN... THE ??
?? BROTHERHOOD OF MAN ??
?? DEDICATED TO GIVING ALL ??
?? WE CAN ??
?? OH-H, AREN'T
YOU PROUD TO BE ??
?? IN THAT FRATERNITY ??
?? THE GREAT BIG
BROTHERHOOD OF MAN ??
OW !
WHAT'D I DO ?
NO KIDDIN' !
?? IS THERE REALLY
A BROTHERHOOD ??
?? OF MAN ??
?? YOU ARE A BROTHER ??
?? A BENEVOLENT BROTHERHOOD
OF MAN ??
?? OH, YES, OH, YES
A NOBLE TIE THAT BINDS ??
?? ALL HUMAN HEARTS AND MINDS ??
?? INTO ONE
BROTHERHOOD OF MAN ??
?? OH, YES
OUR LIFELONG MEMBERSHIP ??
?? IS FREE ??
?? KEEP GIVIN' EACH BROTHER ALL

WELL, PONTY,
WHAT DO YOU THINK ?
LARGE.
SMITTY,
YOU DON'T THINK THAT ROSEMARY
WENT HOME TO HER MOTHER ?
SHE JUST HAS TO BE HERE.

IT'S JUST NO GOOD WITHOUT HER.
I'LL CALL HER FAMILY'S PLACE.
MAYBE THEY'VE HEARD FROM HER.
