All right. All right, Sarah,
you had your water.
Now let's get you upstairs
and into bed.
But... But... But, I have to...
He said Santa would have to
fly faster than light...
...to get to every house in one night.
And to hold everyone's presents...
...his sled would be bigger
than an ocean liner.
Your brother said that? He was just
kidding you. He knows there's a Santa.
He said he wasn't sure.
He wasn't sure if Santa was for real.
Of course Santa is real.
He's as real as Christmas itself.
But he won't come until you're
sound asleep, young lady.
Sweet dreams.
Santa will be here before you know it.
So go to sleep.
"Stark, barren.
Devoid of life. "
He's gotta be asleep by now.
He used to stay awake all night
waiting for Santa.
Think those days are just about over.
That would be sad if that were true.
Yeah, an end of the magic.
Merry Christmas, sweetheart.
See, he's out like a light.
An express train
wouldn't wake him up now.
All aboard!
Well? You coming?
Where?
Why, to the North Pole, of course.
This is the Polar Express.
The North Pole?
I see.
Hold this, please.
Thank you.
Is this you?
- Yeah.
- Well, it says here...
...no photo with a department-store
Santa this year, no letter to Santa.
And you made your sister
put out the milk and cookies.
Sounds to me like
this is your crucial year.
If I were you, I would think
about climbing onboard.
Come on, come on.
I've got a schedule to keep.
Suit yourself.
Hey. Hey, you. Yeah, you.
Do you know what kind of train this is?
Train. Do you know what kind of train
this is? Do you?
Of course.
It's a magic train.
- We're going to the North Pole.
- I know it's a magic train.
It's a Baldwin 2-8-4 S3-class
steam locomotive...
...built in 1931 at the Baldwin Locomotive
Works. It weighs 456,100 pounds and...
Are we really going to the North Pole?
- Hey, look!
- Isn't that wonderful?
Herpolsheimer's! Herpolsheimer's!
Wow, look at all those presents.
I want all of them.
It's so Christmassy and cozy
and beautiful!
Tickets.
Tickets, please.
Try your pocket.
Try your other pocket.
Thank you, sir.
Hey, watch out, there.
Thank you, sir.
That is a public-address microphone.
It is not a toy.
Boy, that guy sure likes to show off.
Look what that wise guy
punched on my ticket.
- "L-E." What the heck does that mean?
- Next stop, 11344 Edbrooke.
We're heading for the other side
of the tracks.
Well? You coming?
It's just another pickup.
That's weird. I thought you were
supposed to be the last one.
Why, to the North Pole, of course.
This is the Polar Express.
Suit yourself.
Hey, that kid wants
to get on the train.
Come on!
Hurry up!
We have to stop the train.
- I don't know how.
- Pull the emergency brake!
Who in the blazes applied
that emergency brake?!
He did.
You.
In case you didn't know, that cord
is for emergency purposes only.
And in case you weren't aware,
tonight is Christmas Eve.
And in case you hadn't noticed,
this train is on a very tight schedule.
Now, young man, Christmas
may not be important to some people...
...but it is very important
to the rest of us!
But... But...
He was just trying to stop the train
so that kid could get on.
I see. Young man,
is that what happened?
Well...
Let me remind you we are
on a very tight schedule.
And I've never been late before...
...and I am certainly not
going to be late tonight.
Now, everybody, take your seats, please!
Thank you.
Your attention, please.
Are there any Polar Express passengers
in need of refreshment?
- Me! Me! Me!
- I thought so.
You know, Montezuma,
the king of the Aztecs...
...would drink 50 quarts
of hot chocolate every day.
It was thick as mud and red.
He put chili pepper in instead of sugar.
- Get it? Hot chocolate?
- How do you know? That's not true.
- Where you going with that?
- It's for him.
- I don't think we're to leave our seats.
- It's a violation of safety regulations...
...for a kid to cross moving cars
without a grown-up.
I think I'll be okay.
Are you sure?
What about this lad in the back?
Did he get any refreshment?
Well, let's take some to him,
by all means.
Watch your step, now. Watch your step.
She forgot her ticket.
It hasn't been punched.
What are you doing?
You're gonna get us in trouble!
Young lady, forgive me.
I believe I have neglected
to punch your ticket.
May I?
I left my ticket right here on the seat.
- But it's gone.
- You mean...
...you have lost your ticket.
She didn't lose her ticket.
I did.
I was trying to return it to you.
But the wind blew it out of my hand.
You can have my ticket.
These tickets are not transferable.
Young lady...
...you will just have to
come along with me.
You know what's gonna happen now?
He's gonna throw her off the train.
He's gonna probably throw her
off the rear platform.
Standard procedure. That way,
she won't get sucked under the wheels.
They may slow the train down,
but they're never gonna stop it.
Stop it?
That's it! I have to stop the train again.
No, please, don't do that again.
Where'd they go?
What happened to them?
Please, she's in big trouble.
You have to help me.
I found your ticket! Wait!
Wait!
I have your ticket!
Is there something I can do for you?
I'm looking for a girl.
A gi...?
Ain't we all?
I have her ticket.
Well, lookie. Lookie here. What is this?
This is an official, authentic,
genuine ticket to ride.
You better keep this
in a safe place, young man.
If I was you...
I keep all my valuables right here.
Right here in the old size 13.
Experience shows
this is the safest place.
Not that I have much use for those.
Tickets.
I ride for free.
Oh, yeah, yeah. I hop aboard this rattler
any time I feels like it.
I own this train. Oh, yeah.
It's like I'm the king of this train.
Yeah. The king of the Pol Ex.
In fact, I am the king
of the North Pole!
Oh, where's my manners? Sit, sit. Sit.
Take a load off.
Hey, would you like some Joe?
Nice hot refreshment.
Perfect for a cold winter's night.
There. Bless you.
What about Santa?
- Santa?
- Isn't he the king of the North Pole?
You mean this guy?
What exactly is your persuasion
on the big man?
Since you brought him up.
Well, I...
I want to believe.
- But...
- But you don't wanna be bamboozled.
You don't wanna be
led down the primrose path.
You don't wanna be conned or duped,
have the wool pulled over your eyes.
Hoodwinked. You don't wanna be
taken for a ride, railroaded.
Seeing is believing.
Am I right?
But what about this train?
What about it?
We're all really going
to the North Pole...
...aren't we?
Aren't we?
Are you saying
that this is all just a dream?
You said it, kid. Not me.
So let's go find that girl.
One other thing.
Do you believe in ghosts?
Interesting.
Wait.
I have to wake up.
Yeah. I have to wake up.
Wake up. Wake up. Wake up.
Kid!
Kid, get your head out of the clouds!
Wake up, kid!
There's no sleepwalking
on the Polar Express.
We gotta jump them knuckles.
Come on, kid. Flip my shoulders.
Grab my lily.
That skirt you're chasing
must have moved ahead.
- We gotta hightail it to the hog, pronto.
- To the hog?
The engine. The engine, you tenderfoot.
We gotta make the engine
before we hit Flat Top Tunnel.
How come?
So many questions.
There is but one inch of clearance
between the roof of this rattler...
...and the roof of Flat Top Tunnel.
Savvy?
It's just the run up to the hump, kid.
This will be interesting.
Get back on, kid. Hurry!
Grab my muck stick.
There's only one trick to this, kid.
When I say "jump"...
...you jump!
You. I thought you got thrown off, and...
- You're driving the train?
- They put me in charge.
- The engineer had to check the light.
- Here's the light. Careful.
All right, now.
I got it.
- How do you know how?
- It's easy. Come here, I'll show you.
This big lever here, that's the throttle.
This little one here, that's the brake.
And those are the pressure gauges.
And that rope is the whistle.
The whistle.
You wanna try it?
I've wanted to do that my whole life.
Hold still! Hold still! Don't move!
Look!
Stop the train! Stop the train!
Stop the train!
What?
They want us to stop the train.
- Which one is the brake?
- He told me this was.
- Who?
- The engineer.
- The engineer? This one looks like a brake.
- No, he said this was the brake.
Are you sure?
Pull the brake!
Stop the train!
Caribou?
There can be no Christmas without
the Polar Express arriving on time.
Am I the only one who understands that?
You. I should have known.
Are you bound and determined that
this train never reaches the North Pole?
But look.
Caribou crossing?!
I make that herd to be at least
It's gonna be hours
before they clear this track.
- A tough nut to crack.
- We are in some serious jelly.
- And a jam.
- Tight spot.
- Up a creek.
- Up a tree.
- Lost in the grass.
- I'll tell you what's grass: Our a...
Problem solved. All ahead, slow.
We're going pretty fast.
Tell the engineer to slow down.
Slow it down.
Watch the speed!
Jumping jeepers,
the cotter pin sheared off.
- What?
- The pin.
- Where?
- There.
- They can't hear me.
- They can't?
I don't like the look of this.
Under the safety bar.
Is everything all right?
What should we do?
Considering we've lost communication
with the engineer...
...we are standing totally exposed
on the front of the locomotive...
...the train appears to be
accelerating uncontrollably...
...and we are rapidly
approaching Glacier Gulch...
...which happens to be the steepest
downhill grade in the world...
...I suggest we all hold on...
...tightly.
- The pin.
- The pin.
Jiminy Christmas, the ice has frozen
over the tracks.
Hold on. Hold on. No, no.
Come on. Watch your step.
Come on, sweetie.
Up you go. Up you go.
Put your feet on here. On here.
Little adventure, huh?
Young man, quick thinking on your part.
Step to your left, please. To your left.
Well, that is more like it.
What in the name of Mike?
Look.
Get us the blazes out of here!
Turn this sled around.
Look there.
Tracks.
Dead ahead.
Right.
Left.
Right.
Hang a Louie.
Toss a Ritchie.
Port astern.
To the starboard.
- My slipper.
- You're gonna lose your ticket.
It's not my ticket, it's yours.
- It's my ticket?
- Yes.
Right. Keep up with me. Left.
Right. Left.
Right.
Left.
Right.
Left. Right.
- Oh, no!
- Oh, no!
Brace yourselves!
Well, that's more like it.
Thank you.
Thank you. I can't believe
you found my ticket.
Did someone say they found a ticket?
Well, in that case... Tickets, please.
Thank you.
- "L-E"?
- Just like that know-it-all kid.
Watch your step.
Tricky walking up here.
It's mighty slick.
Mighty slick, I tell you.
There you go. What did I tell you?
Years ago, on my first Christmas Eve run,
I was up on the roof making my rounds...
...when I slipped on the ice myself.
I reached out for a hand iron,
but it broke off. I slid and fell.
And yet, I did not fall off this train.
Someone saved you?
Or something.
An angel.
Maybe.
Wait. Wait.
What did he look like? Did you see him?
No, sir. But sometimes
seeing is believing.
And sometimes the most real things
in the world are the things we can't see.
The forsaken and the abandoned.
Mind your step, now.
These poor toys have suffered enough...
...being left to rust and decay in the
back alleys and vacant lots of the world.
What are they doing here?
It's a new concept
the boss came up with.
Instead of being thrown away,
they're collected. Refurbished.
He calls it "rebicycling. "
Something like that.
Makes me wanna cry...
...seeing toys that were
treated this way.
These hopelessly entangled
string puppets and marionettes...
...pose a particular problem. We found
the nimble fingers of our work force...
...here at the North Pole are best
for working out those knots and tangles.
Thank you. Double-locked here.
You are just like me, my friend.
A scrooge!
Ebenezer Scrooge.
North Pole, Santa Claus, this train...
...it's all a bunch of humbug.
A bout of indigestion.
Oh, yeah. I know what you are.
You're a doubter.
A doubter. You don't believe!
You're a doubter! You don't believe!
You missed it.
We rode down some really sharp hills.
We were on what looked like
a frozen lake.
But I know it was just
an optical illusion.
He said the train was on ice.
I said it's impossible...
You can't put a train track...
Where you going now?
Look.
The northern lights.
Hey. You three.
We just crossed it.
Latitude 66°33'.
The Arctic Circle.
And do you see?
Those lights in the distance.
They look like the lights of a strange
ocean liner sailing on a frozen sea.
There...
...is the North Pole.
We made it. With five minutes to spare.
We made it.
There should be elves.
Where are the elves?
Yeah, where are the elves?
They are gathering
in the center of the city.
That is where Santa will give
the first gift of Christmas.
Who gets the first gift of Christmas?
He will choose one of you.
- Look.
- Elves!
All right. All right,
ladies and gentlemen.
Two columns, if you please.
Shorter in the front, taller in the rear.
Even-numbered birthdays on the right,
odd-numbered on the left.
No pushing. No pushing.
But let's not dilly-dally.
It's five minutes to midnight.
Hey, what gives? It was five minutes
till midnight four minutes ago.
Exactly. Columns of two.
- One, two.
- Excuse me.
- Question.
- What about him?
No one is required to see Santa.
Ladies and gentlemen,
you do not have to hold hands...
- Come on.
... but please remain in your columns...
...while we are in transit.
- Look, you have to come with us.
- She's right.
Christmas just doesn't work out
for me. Never has.
But Christmas is such a wonderful,
beautiful time.
It's a time for giving and being thankful,
for friends and family.
People hang decorations and lights. Santa
leaves presents under our Christmas trees.
Christmas just...
...doesn't work out for me.
Look, I don't know if Christmas
is gonna work out for you or not...
...but this is Christmas Eve.
Don't stay here by yourself.
Yes, come with us.
We'll go together.
Oh, no.
We're gonna be okay.
Maybe not!
The emergency brake.
The emergency brake.
There's no brake. I can't find the brake!
Take a break, kid.
How about a nice, good hot cup of Joe?
We're gonna crash!
We're spinning.
You hear that?
The bell.
- What bell?
- The sleighbell.
- Sleighbell?
- Don't you hear it?
It's coming from that tunnel.
That's the way we should go.
Come on.
What?
- What?
- Come on.
Come on.
We're lost.
Yes.
- Yes. I hear it.
- I hear it too.
- I don't hear anything.
- Okay, it's down this way.
Are you sure?
Absolutely.
Why can't I hear anything?
Get down and be quiet.
Yeah.
Okay.
Well, that was the wrapping hall, chief.
- Just finished the last one.
- How's it wrapped?
It's wrapped in candy-striped red
with a number-seven holly-green bow.
A number-seven bow?
When we're this close to liftoff?
What are they thinking down there?
Are they meshuggener?
- What's the routing?
- Going to the States.
Grand Rapids, Michigan.
That's my town. I'm from Grand Rapids.
We got a troublemaker now.
Just what we need.
Things aren't bad enough.
What's his 20?
Apparently, some kid
from Maplewood, New Jersey...
...stuck some gum in his sister's hair.
New Jersey? Is that the same kid
that put the tack...
...underneath his teacher's chair
last year?
- No, sir. This kid's name is Steven.
- Steven.
So, what do we do, chief?
Alert the big man?
We talking nothing for Christmas here?
Look, it's...
It's almost Christmas, huh?
We'll cut the kid a break.
But put him on the check-twice list
for next year.
All right, boys.
Let's shut it down.
That's it for this year. Come on.
- Hey, boss, are we taking the pneumatic?
- Of course we're taking the pneumatic.
It's the only way to get
to the square on time.
- Let's go.
- And time is money.
Ready, and mount.
Good. Close.
All right, get in.
I don't know about this.
I don't hear it. Do you?
No.
I think we should follow those arrows.
I thought there'd be a way out.
We're gonna miss everything.
Hey, look.
A present.
It's going to my town.
To someone named Billy.
- My name is Billy.
- It's going to 11344 Edbrooke Avenue.
That's my address.
Come on.
Look.
It says, "Merry Christmas, Billy.
From Mr. C."
I think I know what it is.
I wanted one of these my whole life.
Wait, wait. Stop. Look.
But I...
Those are the rules.
Something's got me.
It's got my leg.
I can't hold him.
Give me your other hand.
Give me your other hand.
- I can't.
- On three.
One, two, three.
- Look.
- It's still got me.
On three again. One, two, three.
- You.
- You.
- What are you doing here?
- Same as you.
Checking my presents. Making sure
I'm getting everything on my list.
I found one present.
All it had was stupid underwear.
Look.
It's still five to.
I think we're gonna make it.
Of course. It's been five to
for the last hour.
We got plenty of time. We got nothing
but time. We got time to kill.
You know what?
I don't think we're gonna make it.
I may be just an old railroader...
...and know nothing about
lighter-than-air craft...
...but from my layman's perspective,
you need more altitude!
More altitude!
Geronimo!
The Flying Elves.
They are specialists.
Do not try that at home, kids.
Do not try that at home.
We're not gonna make it.
A well-oiled machine.
All right, you stowaways.
- Party's over.
- I was just following them.
We fell in here by mistake.
Forget about it. We knew you
was in there the whole time.
Come on, out you go.
Let's go, come on.
Step up, step up. There we go.
Not a problem. Come on.
Watch your step. There you go.
So nobody gets hurt, here's
how we're gonna get you guys down.
- This is simple. Why, I know...
- What do you know?
You're not supposed to be here
in the first place.
But since it's Christmas,
I'm gonna let you slide.
Hey.
Been looking for you.
There you go.
Watch your step.
Careful.
Beautiful form. Beautiful.
Nice to see you again.
Cutting it kind of close, aren't we?
I'll take care of this.
It's in good hands.
Trust me.
Aren't those bells
the most beautiful sound?
He's here! He's here!
Where?
I see him. He's over there.
I can't see him.
I believe.
What was that you said?
I believe.
I believe.
I believe that this is yours.
Well...
Thank you.
- Me, me. Pick me, Santa.
- What are you doing? Stop it.
- Pick me, pick me. I want the first gift.
- Hush.
Young man...
...patience.
And a smidgen of humility
might also serve you well.
Yes, sir.
And you, young lady...
A lady of decision.
Full of confidence and spirit.
Christmas spirit.
Keep up the good work.
Thank you.
And Billy.
It is Billy?
I see you've made some new friends.
Yes, sir. I sure have.
That's a lucky lad.
There's no greater gift than friendship.
And speaking of gifts...
...let's have this young fellow
right here.
Now...
...what would you like for Christmas?
Me.
You.
Yes. Indeed.
Yes, indeed.
The first gift of Christmas!
This bell is a wonderful symbol
of the spirit of Christmas...
...as am I.
Just remember...
...the true spirit of Christmas...
...lies in your heart.
Merry Christmas.
Better keep that in a safe place.
Hey, hey. Man alive, are you lucky.
Pull, Comet. Pull, boy!
Prancer, that's a girl.
Good boy, Donder.
Now, Dasher. Now, Prancer and Vixen.
It's everything I dreamed it would be.
Could all...?
Could all this be nothing but a dream?
No.
All aboard!
One, two. One, two, three, go.
Come on, shorty!
Show your tickets.
Have your tickets ready.
Remember to eat
the five basic food groups.
Ticket, please.
And please brush after every meal.
Remember to duck and cover.
All right, you. Ticket, please.
"Lean. " Whatever that's
supposed to mean.
"Lean" is spelled with four letters.
I believed I punched five.
Hey, are you saying
I don't know how to...?
I'm sorry. It says "learn. " My mistake.
Lesson learned.
Ticket.
That is some special ticket.
Sure is.
So can you count on us
to get you home safe and sound?
Absolutely.
Me...
...and my friends.
Ticket.
It says "lead. " Like "lead balloon. "
I believe it also is pronounced "lead. "
As in "leader," "leadership. "
"Lead the way. "
Follow you anywhere, ma'am.
Ah, yes.
Young man with all the questions.
Ticket.
It says...
It's nothing I need to know.
- Come on, let's see the bell.
- Let's see it.
- Come on, let's see the bell.
- Show us the bell.
Yeah, let's see the bell.
It's gone.
- Where is it?
- I lost it.
I lost the bell from Santa's sleigh.
It's gone?
Don't worry.
- We'll... We'll find it.
- Yeah, we'll find it.
Yeah, we'll help you. All of us.
Yeah, let's hurry out
and find it right now.
It's too late.
Gee, that's really too bad.
Really.
I'm sorry.
Next stop, 11344 Edbrooke.
Hey, where you going?
Home.
Oh, okay. Merry Christmas.
Thanks for stopping the train for me.
Have a wonderful Christmas.
Watch your step, please.
And merry Christmas.
Look.
Santa got to Billy's house already.
Look, look! Santa got here!
Isn't that amazing?
It is amazing.
It is amazing.
I'm sorry about the bell.
It was a really special present.
Well, you know what they say.
It's the thought that counts.
Yeah.
Well, see you.
Well...
...see you.
See you.
Watch your step, please.
Thank you.
No, thank you.
One thing about trains:
It doesn't matter where they're going.
What matters is deciding to get on.
Merry Christmas!
What?
Merry Christmas!
Wake up. Wake up.
Santa's been here. Santa's been here.
Hurry up. Hurry up!
Mom, Dad, wake up. Wake up!
Santa's been here! Santa's been here!
Mom, Dad, look!
He brought us all kinds of stuff!
Look, a train!
This is the beautiful-est,
most wonderful-est Christmas ever.
Wait. Look.
Here's one more.
Has your name on it.
Oh, what a beautiful bell.
Who's it from?
- Santa.
- Santa?
Really?
- Oh, that's too bad.
- What's this?
Broken.
Sorry about that, sport.
Come on, kids. We don't wanna be late.
