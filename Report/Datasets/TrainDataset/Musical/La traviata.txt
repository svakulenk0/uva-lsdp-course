It's late.
We expected you earlier.
We were gambling at Flora's.
A card game makes time fly.
Flora, my dear friends...
you bring new life...
and splendor to the evening.
Wine will liven the party.
Can you enjoy the festivities?
I want to.
I believe that pleasure...
is the best cure for what ails me.
Pleasure alone can brighten life.
In Alfredo Germont, madam...
you'll find someone
who adores you.
Few friends match such devotion.
Dear Viscount...
I thank you for the thought.
My dear Alfredo!
Marquis.
As I said, friendship here...
is no stranger to pleasure.
Is everything ready?
Take your seats, my friends.
Let the pleasures of the table...
open everyone's heart.
Well said! And let the wine...
banish our most secret pain.
Let the pleasures of the table...
open everyone's heart.
Alfredo's always thinking of you.
You're joking!
While you were ill,
he came by every day.
Don't say that.
I am nothing to him.
I'm not lying.
Is it true?
I don't understand.
Yes, it's true.
I'm indebted to you.
You, Baron, never cared as much.
I've only known you for a year.
He just met me a minute ago!
You should have
kept your mouth shut.
I dislike that young man.
Why?
I find him charming.
Aren't you saying anything?
Only our hostess
can make him speak.
I'll be Hebe,
cupbearer to the gods.
And I hope just as immortal.
Let's drink! Let's drink!
Baron, a toast...
for this happy occasion!
It's up to you, then.
Y es, yes, a toast!
I'm not inspired just now.
But you're so good at it.
Would it please you?
Yes? Then it's already
in my heart.
Your attention, then.
Quiet. Let's listen...
to the poet.
Let's drink...
Iet's drink
from this chalice of joy...
that beauty so enhances.
May the fleeting instant...
be given over to voluptuousness.
Let's drink to that sweet ecstasy...
that love arouses.
The power of piercing eyes...
straight at the heart is aimed.
Let's drink to love...
and our drinking...
will render our kisses
more ardent.
With you all...
I'll learn to share...
my hours of leisure.
Life is folly...
and only pleasure counts.
Let's enjoy ourselves...
for love burns fast.
A flower that blooms and dies...
it was never meant to last.
So revel and rejoice...
bids an alluring voice!
Life means celebration--
If you have not known love.
Don't tell me. I never have.
That seems to be my fate!
Wouldn't you like to dance now?
What a lovely idea!
We'd love to, of course.
Let's go, then.
What's wrong?
Nothing... nothing.
Why do you stop?
Let's go.
Oh, God!
Again?
Are you ill?
Heavens, what is it?
I felt a chill.
Go on.
I'll follow in a moment.
As you wish.
I'm so pale!
Oh, it's you!
Is the spell over?
I feel better.
You'll kill yourself if you go on.
You must take care of yourself.
How could l?
If you were mine...
I would protect you...
and watch over you.
Why do you say that?
No one has ever cared.
Because no one really loved you.
No one--
But me.
It's true! I had forgotten
this great passion!
You laugh!
Have you no heart?
A heart? Maybe.
Why do you ask?
If you had one...
you wouldn't laugh.
Is that true?
I'm not lying.
How long have you loved me?
It's been a year now.
One day...
so radiant and ethereal...
you suddenly appeared to me.
And from that day on...
I have burned...
with a secret passion.
With a love...
that is the heartbeat...
of the universe...
of the entire universe.
Mysterious...
mysterious and proud...
torment...
torment and delight...
delight of my heart.
If that is true, then run away.
For friendship is all I can offer.
I'm not able to love...
nor could I bear such heroism.
Love, mysterious and proud--
You have to be able...
to forget me.
Forget me.
What the devil are you doing?
Just chatting.
All right, then. Continue.
So no more talk of love.
Agreed?
As you say.
I'll leave.
Is it that bad?
Take this flower.
But why?
Bring it back.
When?
When it withers.
Oh, God! Tomorrow!
All right. Tomorrow.
I'm so happy!
Then you still love me?
I love you so.
Are you leaving?
Good-bye.
I am overwhelmed.
Good-bye.
Good-bye.
Dawn awakens the day.
It's time to say good-bye.
Thank you, kind lady,
for such a splendid time.
The town is full of revelry.
The pleasure hour is over.
In sleep we'll find strength.
Tomorrow we'll begin again.
How strange.
His words are carved in my heart.
Will true love...
bring misfortune to me?
What do you feel,
my troubled soul?
No man ever moved you so.
An exaltation...
Iike I've never known!
To love and be loved!
Could I turn such love away...
for this mad, sterile life of mine?
It must be him...
whose portrait my soul...
Iost in the whirl...
has often liked to paint...
in secret colors.
He, so modest and considerate...
came to my side...
awakening the flame of love.
Oh, love!
A love that is the heartbeat...
of the universe...
the entire universe.
Mysterious...
mysterious and proud...
torment and delight...
delight of my heart.
Madness! Madness!
It's all a mere illusion.
Poor woman...
alone and forsaken...
in this populous desert
they call Paris.
What can I hope for?
What should I do?
Abandon myself...
to the whirl of pleasure!
To die of sin!
To revel!
I must be forever free...
to flutter
from pleasure to pleasure.
I want my life to flow...
down the paths of pleasure...
from dawn to dusk...
in joyous company.
My thoughts should fly...
towards pleasures fresh and new.
Love...
Iove is the heartbeat...
of the universe...
the entire universe.
Madness! Madness!
There's no joy for me...
away from her!
Three months have passed...
since my Violetta...
gave up for me...
wealth, luxury...
and sumptuous parties...
where every admirer was a slave...
paying homage...
to her beauty!
Now she's happy...
in this secluded place.
She has forsaken all for me.
Here, next to her...
I feel reborn...
redeemed by the breath of love.
In her radiance...
the past is forgotten.
She has tempered...
the youthful ardor...
of my fiery soul...
with the gentle smile of love.
From the day she said...
"l want to live...
remaining faithful only to you"...
forgetting the outside world...
I live...
as if in heaven!
Annina, where were you?
In Paris.
Who sent you?
My mistress.
Why?
To sell the horses, carriages
and everything she owns.
What are you saying?
It's so expensive
to live here, alone.
You never told me.
I had orders not to.
Orders? How much is needed?
A thousand louis.
Go now. I'm off to Paris.
Your mistress mustn't know.
I can still arrange everything.
He's gone to Paris.
And will return...?
Before evening.
He asked me to tell you.
How strange!
It's for you.
A businessman
should be here soon.
Show him in at once.
Flora has found out
my hiding place.
She's asking me
to the ball tonight!
She'll wait in vain.
There's a gentleman waiting.
He must be the one I expect.
Mademoiselle Valery?
I am Alfredo's father.
The young fool,
bewitched by you...
is headed for disaster!
I, sir, am a woman...
and this is my house.
Allow me to leave...
for your sake more than mine.
She has character! And yet--
You've been deceived.
He would give you all he owns.
So far he hasn't dared.
I would refuse.
Still, all this luxury--
It's a mystery to everyone.
It shouldn't be to you.
Heavens!
What's the meaning of this?
You want to rid yourself...
of all your possessions?
A woman with your past--
It exists no more.
I love Alfredo.
God has absolved me
of my past...
through my repentance.
A noble sentiment, I admit.
How sweet is the sound
of your words!
But I must ask a sacrifice
from you.
Oh, no, don't say it!
What you will ask
must be terrible.
I knew it. I was expecting you.
I was much too happy!
Alfredo's father...
must ask you...
to think of the fate...
of his two children.
Two children?
God granted me a daughter...
pure as an angel.
If Alfredo doesn't return...
to the bosom of his family...
the young man she loves
and who loves her...
and whom she is soon to marry...
would break the engagement...
that would have made them
so happy.
Please don't change into thorns...
the roses of love.
Oh, how I pray that your heart...
will grant my request.
I understand.
I have to leave Alfredo
for a while.
It will be painful for me. Still--
That is not what I ask.
God, what more do you want?
I've granted so much already!
It's still not enough.
You want me to give him up?
You must.
Oh, no, never!
No, never!
Can you not see
the great passion...
that lives and burns
in my breast?
Having neither family
nor friends...
among the living.
Alfredo swore...
he'd be everything to me!
Don't you know
my life is tainted...
with a dreadful malady?
That I know the end is near?
Leave Alfredo!
A torture so cruel
I would rather die!
Yes, I'd rather die!
It is a great sacrifice...
but listen to me calmly.
You're beautiful...
you're young...
and in time--
Oh, say no more!
I understand...
but it's impossible.
I could only love him.
Perhaps.
But men...
are often fickle--
Good God!
One day, time...
will tarnish your charms.
Then boredom will set in.
What then?
Think it over.
You will find no help...
in the force of your love.
For the Lord
will not have blessed...
a union such as yours.
Then give up...
this seductive dream.
It is true.
Become instead...
our family's guardian angel.
Violetta, for pity's sake...
there's still time!
God Himself, my child...
God speaks
through a grieving father.
Then there's no hope...
for the wretched woman...
who fell from grace one day.
She will never rise again.
God, in all His kindness...
may nonetheless forgive her.
But men will not relent!
Tell your daughter...
so innocent and beautiful...
that a victim of misfortune...
has renounced...
for her sake...
her one glimmer of hope...
before dying!
Weep, weep...
poor, unhappy child.
Courage!
A heart as noble as your own...
will surely triumph!
What must I do?
Tell him you don't love him.
He won't believe me.
Then leave.
He would follow.
Like your daughter...
take me in your arms.
It will make me strong.
Soon you'll have him back...
heartbroken...
and you'll console him.
What will you do?
If you knew, you'd stop me.
Noble creature!
What can I do for you?
I'll die!
But when I'm dead...
don't let him curse my memory.
At least let him know...
how much I've suffered for him.
No, my child, you must live...
and find happiness.
Heaven will reward...
your tears some day.
- He must know the sacrifice...
- Your great sacrifice...
- I made for love.
- will one day be rewarded.
- My last breath...
- You'll then be proud...
- will be for him!
- of an act so noble.
Someone's coming. Go.
My heart's so grateful to you!
Leave!
We may never meet again.
Be happy!
Farewell!
Give me strength...
O God!
Did you call?
Deliver this note in person.
Quiet!
Go now.
I must write him.
What will I say?
Who will give me the courage?
What are you doing?
Nothing.
Writing?
You're so nervous.
Who is the letter for?
For you.
Give it to me!
Not yet.
Forgive me. I'm worried.
My father was here.
You saw him?
No. He left me a stern letter.
But he'll be back.
He'll love you at first sight.
He mustn't find me here.
Let me go.
Calm him.
I'll throw myself at his feet.
He will not separate us.
We'll be happy...
because you love me, Alfredo.
You love me, don't you?
You love me, Alfredo.
You love me!
So very much!
Why are you crying?
I need these tears.
Now I'm better.
Can't you tell?
I'm smiling. See?
I'll be there...
among my flowers...
close to you always...
always close to you.
Love me, Alfredo...
as much as I love you!
Farewell!
My darling lives...
only for my love.
It's late.
My father won't come.
Someone's in the garden.
Who is it?
Monsieur Germont?
A lady in a carriage,
not far from here...
gave me this for you.
From Violetta!
Why am I so moved?
Perhaps she wants me
to join her.
I'm shaking.
Courage!
"Alfredo, by the time
you read this letter--"
Father!
My son, I know
how you must suffer.
Cry no more.
Come back to your father.
You're his pride and joy!
The sea and soil of Provence...
what erased them
from your heart?
What fate lured you away...
from the sunny land of your birth?
Remember in your sorrow...
the joy that you knew...
and that the same burning sun...
will restore your peace of mind.
I have you back at last.
I never lost hope,
and God heard my prayer.
Are you refusing
your father's love?
A thousand demons rage in me!
Leave me!
Leave you?
Revenge!
Do not linger here. Let's go!
It was the baron!
Do you hear me?
Am I to lose you...
now that I've found you again?
She's gone to the ball!
I must demand satisfaction!
What are you saying? Stop!
Tonight is the night of masks.
The viscount is in charge.
Violetta and Alfredo are invited.
Haven't you heard the news?
Violetta and Germont
are no longer together.
She's coming with the baron.
I saw them yesterday.
They seemed happy.
Hush! Do you hear?
Our friends are here!
We are gypsies...
come from afar.
On every palm...
we can read the future.
The stars we consult...
have no secrets for us.
Concerning the future...
we can predict everything.
Let's see.
You, madam...
have many rivals.
You, Marquis, will never be...
a model of fidelity.
So you're fooling around?
You'll pay for this!
What are you saying?
It's all a lie!
An old fox
cannot mend its ways.
Watch out, Marquis...
or you'll regret it!
The matter is closed.
The past is past.
What's done is done.
Let's look to the future.
We, the matadors of Madrid...
are the heroes of the arena.
We want to know the madness...
of Carnival in Paris.
Let us tell you a story...
that recounts
what lovers we are.
Bravo! Tell us!
We would love
to hear your stories!
Alfredo, you've come!
I'm here, my friends.
Where is Violetta?
No idea.
You don't care! Bravo!
Now, can we start the game?
I'm so glad you came.
You were kind to ask me.
I'm honored, Baron...
to welcome you as well.
Germont is here!
Did you see him?
I see him.
Not one word...
to this Alfredo.
Not one word!
What a fool I was to come!
God have pity on me!
Sit beside me.
Tell me the news.
Four.
You win again.
Unlucky in love...
Iucky at cards.
He always wins!
Oh, I'll win, all right...
and with the gold I'll win...
I'll happily go back
to the country.
Alone?
I'll take someone
I once lived with...
and who left me!
Stop or I'll leave.
Are you speaking to me, Baron?
Your winning streak...
is irresistible to me.
I accept the challenge.
I think I'll die.
Lord, have mercy on me!
A hundred louis on the right.
And a hundred on the left.
Ace.
Knave.
You win.
Double?
Double.
Four... seven.
Again!
I win again!
Bravo! Bravo!
It's Alfredo's night!
The baron will pay for sure!
Continue without me.
Dinner is served.
What will happen?
I think I'll die.
Have mercy, O Lord...
have mercy on me.
If you wish to continue--
Not at the moment.
I'll get even later.
Any game you choose.
Let's go with our friends.
Later.
As you wish.
I asked him to meet me here.
Will he come? Will he listen?
He'll come.
His bitter hatred...
will bring him,
if not my request.
You asked me here.
What do you want?
You must leave this place.
You're in danger here.
Ah! I understand! Enough!
Do you think me so vile?
No, never!
Why are you afraid?
I'm afraid of the baron.
There's bad blood between us.
If I should win the duel...
a single blow would take away...
your lover and your protector.
Does the prospect frighten you?
But what if he should kill you?
That's the one tragedy...
I fear I could not endure.
What's my death to you?
Please go! This instant!
I'll leave, but swear...
you'll follow me...
wherever I go!
No, never!
Never?
Go, unfortunate man, and forget
this dishonored name.
Leave this instant.
I took a sacred oath
to leave you.
Who could ask such a thing?
Someone who had the right.
Was it the baron?
So you do love him!
Y es...
I love him.
Everybody, listen!
Are you calling us?
What do you want?
Do you know this woman?
Who? Violetta?
Do you know
what she has done?
Don't speak--
This woman would give up...
all she owns for my sake.
And l, blind, vile...
and wretched...
accepted it all.
But there's still time.
I want to wipe away
this awful stain.
I have called you here
as witnesses.
Tonight I've paid...
for her favors...
in full!
You've done an infamous thing!
You've wounded such a kind heart!
You've insulted a noble woman!
Leave at once! We despise you!
Worthy of contempt...
becomes the man...
who, even in blind anger...
offends a woman!
Where is my son?
I see him no more.
For in you
Alfredo does not exist.
What have I done?
The horror!
Mad jealousy, betrayed love...
tear at my heart. I cannot reason.
She will never forgive me.
I wanted to escape from her.
I couldn't.
Anger brought me here.
Now that my fury is spent...
I'm damned with regret.
Alfredo, you can't understand...
all the love that's in my heart.
You'll never know that,
at the risk of your hate...
I put my love to the test.
Don't grieve! Take heart!
But a time will come...
when you will learn...
how much I loved you.
Then may God save you...
from remorse.
"You kept your promise.
The duel took place.
The baron was wounded...
but will recover.
Alfredo's gone abroad.
I told him of your sacrifice.
He will return to be forgiven.
I will also come.
Feel better.
You deserve a happier future.
Giorgio Germont."
It's too late!
I wait...
but nobody ever comes.
How I have changed!
The doctor speaks kind words.
But my affliction...
Ieaves no room for hope.
Good-bye...
happy dreams of the past...
The rose of my cheeks
is already fading.
I so desperately need
Alfredo's love...
comfort and sustenance...
of my exhausted soul.
This woman gone astray...
smile upon her...
Have pity on her...
receive her, O Lord.
It's all over...
all over!
What is it?
You feel better today...
don't you?
Yes. Why?
Promise you'll keep calm.
What are you driving at?
I want to prepare you
for a happy surprise.
Happy, you say?
Alfredo! You've seen him!
He's coming! Oh, hurry!
Far from Paris, my love...
we shall go, just us two.
We shall spend
the rest of our lives...
together forever.
All our heartaches...
will soon be forgotten.
Your health will return.
You will be my breath
and my life.
The future will smile on us.
Far from Paris, my love...
we shall go, just us two.
We shall spend
the rest of our lives...
together forever.
All our heartaches...
will soon be forgotten.
My health will return.
No more! To church, Alfredo...
we must go...
to offer our thanks
for your return.
You're so pale!
It's nothing. A joyful surprise...
cannot but trouble my sad heart.
It's my illness. I feel weak.
Now I'm strong.
Don't you see?
I'm smiling.
Oh, such a cruel fate!
It's nothing.
Annina, help me get dressed.
Now? Let's wait.
No, I want to go out.
Oh, God, I can't!
Quick, get the doctor!
Tell him Alfredo has returned.
My love brought him back.
Tell him I want to live...
to go on living.
And yet, if your return...
couldn't save my life...
then nothing on Earth
can save me!
Oh, my God, to die so young...
I who suffered so long!
To die now...
when my sorrow has finally ended!
What cruel madness...
this foolish hope of mine!
Was it in vain...
that my heart held fast?
My breath, my heartbeat...
my heart's chosen one...
our tears...
must flow together.
But, more than ever before,
believe me...
we must be faithful now.
Don't turn your heart...
away from hope.
It's you, monsieur!
Father!
You haven't forgotten me?
I kept my promise.
I'm here to hold you in my arms.
Oh, generous woman!
Alas...
you're too late.
But I'm still grateful.
Grenvil, do you see?
I'm dying in the arms...
of those I love most
in the world.
Don't say that!
Oh, God!
It is true!
Don't you see, Father?
Don't hurt me anymore.
Remorse gnaws at my heart.
Every word she says
tears me apart!
Oh, fatuous old man!
Only now do I see
the harm I've done!
Come nearer.
Listen.
Alfredo, my love.
Take this.
It's the image of my past.
It will remind you of someone...
who loved you so well.
No, you can't die!
You must live, my love.
God did not bring me back...
to endure such agony!
If a maiden fair...
should give her heart to you...
marry her.
I want you to.
Show her this portrait.
Tell her it's a gift...
from someone who,
among the angels...
prays...
for her and for you.
As long as eyes have tears...
I will weep for you.
Fly to the kingdom of heaven.
God is calling you.
He is calling you to Him.
How strange!
The spasms...
have stopped.
In me is reborn...
reawakened...
a new strength...
Yes, l.. I...
I am returning to life!
