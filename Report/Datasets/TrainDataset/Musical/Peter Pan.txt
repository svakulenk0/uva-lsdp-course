Some say that as we grow up,
we become different people...
at different ages,
but l don't believe this.
l thinkwe remain the same
throughout,
merely passing in these years
from one room to another...
but always in the same house.
lfwe unlockthe rooms
ofthe far past,
we can look in and see ourselves
beginning to become you and me.

SMALL BOY:.
l won't go to bed, Nana.
l won't go to bed.
-Liza, is it 6:.OO yet?
-Yes.
Please, Nana, do l have to
go to bed?
Liza,we're pretending
we're Mother and Father
and we're going to the ball
tonight. Come play.
Always playing games.
l have much more important
things to do...
than play at make-believe
and dancing.

MOTHER:. Wendy,John.
WENDY:. Oh, Mother!
JOHN:. You look lovely.
MOTHER:. Oh,thankyou.
What are you doing
in my hat?
We're doing an act.
Yes. We're playing at being
you and Father.
l'm Father.
A little less noise there
a little less noise.
Mother,they never let me play
Father. They never let me dance.
Well,we'll soon fix that.
There. May l have the honor
ofthis dance, Mr. Darling?

FATHER:. Mother! Mother!
WENDY:. Oh, it's Father.
Oh,there you are, Mother.
MOTHER:. What's the matter
Father dear?
The matter? This tie. It will
not tie, not round my neck.
Round the bedpost, oh,yes,
but round my neck, no.
Oh, dear no.
Begs to be excused.
Say it again, Father.
Say it again.
A little less noise there.
l warn you ofthis,
that unless this goes round...
my neck properly,we don't go
out to dinnertonight.
lfwe don't go out to dinner,
l'll never go
to the office again,
and if l never go to the office
again,we will starve...
and our children will be flung
into the streets.
CHILDREN:. Oh, no, Father!
Wait a minute, Father dear.
l think l've got it.
Oh! One more day
when all is right.
Oh, Nana, Nana.
Mother, look here.
Hairs all over my trousers.
Clumsy, clumsy.
-l'll brush them off, Father.
-Thankyou.
There's times l think
it's a mistake...
to have a dog for a nurse.
Oh, George. Nana's a treasure.
No doubt. But l sometimes have
a sorrt offeeling...
that she looks upon the children
as her puppies.
George,we must keep Nana.
l'll tell you why.
Get ready for bed, children.
Nana will take you.
That's right.
Now, run along.
George.
Tonight l saw a face
at the window.
Face at the window
two floors up?
lt was a face of a little boy.
He was tying to get in.
Oh, it's impossible.
That's not the first time
l've seen that boy.
-Oh?
-The first time was a week ago.
l remember because it was
Nana's night off.
l was sitting there by the fire,
and suddenly l felt a draft...
as though the windowwere open.
l looked...
and l sawthat boy in the room.
l screamed.
Just then, Nana came back
and sprang at him at once.
The boy leapt at the window.
Nana closed it quickly.
-lt was too late to catch him.
-l thought so.
But wait! He escaped, but his
shadow hadn't time to get out.
l hid it.
l rolled it up.
-And here it is.
-Aha!
Well, l don't think
it's anyone we know,
though he does look a scoundrel.
You know, l think he comes back
tying to get his shadow.
-l daresay.
-But wait!
l haven't told you all.
The boy was not quite alone.
He was accompanied by...
l don't know
howto describe it.
A ball of light
no biggerthan my fist...
that darrted around the room
like a living thing.
This is most unusual.
-George,what can it mean?
-What indeed?
What indeed?
Oh, Nana! Oh, my knee! My knee!
WENDY:. Father, she's cying.
She's cying? What about me?
Go and coddle her.
Nobody ever coddles me.
l'm only the breadwinner.
Why should l be coddled?
Why,why,why?
Not so loud.
Liza will hear.
l refuse to allowthat dog
to lord over me in my nursey...
one hour longer.
WENDY:. Oh, Father!
ln vain, in vain. Your place
is downstairs. Come on, Nana.
MOTHER:. George.
Rememberwhat l told you
about that boy?
Am l master in this house
or is she? Come on, Nana.
FATHER:. Ow!
Come, Nana.
Good Nana.
Nice Nana.
Dear Nana.
Pretty Nana.
Gotcha! Come out! This way!
Oh, he's chaining Nana up!
FATHER:. Out the dooryou go.
JOHN:. She's unhappy.
FATHER:. No, no. There,there.
That's not her unhappy bark.
That's her bark
when she smells danger.
Wendy, are you sure?
Yes, Mother.
WENDY:. Is eveything all right?
lt's all quiet and still.
l wish l weren't going out
to dinnertonight.
MICHAEL:. Can anything
harm us, Mommy,
afterthe night-lights are lit?
No, precious. They're the eyes
a mother leaves behind...
to guard her children.
Now sing your good-night song...
and into your beds.
Tender shepherd,tender shepherd
Let me help you count your sheep
One in the meadow
Two in the garden
Three in the nursey,
fast asleep
MICHAEL:. Tender shepherd,
tender shepherd
JOHN:. Tender shepherd,
tender shepherd
WENDY:. Tender shepherd,
tender shepherd
Watches over all his sheep
One, say your prayers
And two, close your eyes
And three, safe and happily,
fall asleep
Fall asleep
Fall asleep
Fall asleep.
Dear night-lights that protecct
my sleeping children,
burn clear and steadfast
tonight.
Tinker Bell.
Tinker Bell!
Tink! Where are you?
There you are.
Tink, do come out ofthat jug.
Do you knowwhere it is?
Overthere?
My shadow!
l'll stickyou on with soap.
My shadow,what's the matter
with you?
Boy,why are you cying?
What's your name?
Wendy Myra Angela Darling.
What's your name?
Peter Pan.
Where do you live?
Second to the right
and straight on till morning.
ls that what they put
on your letters?
Don't get any letters.
But your mother gets letters.
Don't have a mother.
-Oh, Peter!
-You mustn't touch me!
But why?
No one must evertouch me.
Why not?
l don't know.
No wonderyou were cying.
l wasn't cying about that.
l can't get my shadow
to stick on.
lt's come off? How awful!
Oh, ha ha ha! Peter!
You've been tying
to stick it on with soap.
-Well,then?
-l'll have to sew it on foryou,
my little man.
-Thankyou.
-Now,you sit there.
l daresay this will hurrt
a little.
l never cy.
There!
Thankyou.
PETER:. Wouldn't you know it!
My shadow!
My vey own shadow!
WENDY:. But it's only a shadow.
Yes, but it's all mine.
Oh, l'm clever!
Oh,the cleverness of me!
WENDY:. Of course, l did nothing.
You're conceited!
Conceited?
Not me
lt's just that l am what l am
And l'm me
When l look at myself
and l see in myself
All the wonderful things
that l see
lf l'm pleased with myself
l have evey good reason to be
l gotta crow
l'm just the cleverest fella
'Twas ever my forrtune to know
l taught a trickto my shadow
To stickto the tip of my toe
l gotta crow
l gotta brag
l think it's sweet
l have fingers and feet
l can wiggle and wag
l can climb trees and play tag
with the breeze
ln the meadows below
l gotta crow
lf l were a vey ordinay
Eveyday thing
l'd never be heard
Cock-a-doodlin' round
like a bird
So naturally
When l discoverthe cleverness
of a remarkable me
How can l hide it
When deep down inside,
it just tickles me so?
That l gotta let go
And crow
Ha ha ha!
l'm really a rare thing
Such a fairthing
l can't keep still
l'm bursting with pride
And l just couldn't
keep it inside
lf l tried
So naturally
When l discoverthe cleverness
of a remarkable me
How can l hide it
When deep down inside,
it just tickles me so?
That l gotta let go
And crow
Oh, Peter,you are so clever.
Peter, how old are you?
l don't know.
l ran away from home
the day l was born.
Ran away? Why?
Because l heard Father
and Mother discussing...
what l was to be
when l became a man.
l want to always be a little boy
and have fun.
So l ran away, and l've lived
a long time among the fairies.
Oh, Peter!
Do you really knowfairies?
Yes.
But they're nearly all dead now.
You see,Wendy,when the first
baby laughed forthe first time,
the laugh broke into
a thousand pieces,
and they all went
skipping about.
And that was the beginning
offairies.
So now evey time
a new baby is born,
its first laugh becomes a faiy.
There ought to be a faiy
for evey girl and boy.
WENDY:. Ought to be? Isn't there?
Oh, no.
Children know such a lot now.
Soon,they don't believe.
And evey time a child says
''l don't believe in fairies,''
there's a faiy someplace
that falls down dead.
WENDY:. Poorthings!
l can't think
where she's gone to.
-Tink!
-Peter!
You don't mean to tell me
there's a faiy in this room?!
She came here with me.
Wendy, l believe l've shut her
up in that drawer.
Well,you needn't say that.
Well, l'm vey sory.
Well, how did l know
you were in the drawer?
Tink,this lady wishes
you were herfaiy.
What did she say?
She's not vey polite.
She says you're a great
ugly girl, and she's mine.
Tink,you knowyou can't be my
faiy because l'm a gentleman,
and you're a lady.
What did she say?
She said, ''You silly ass.''
She's quite a common girl,
you know.
Oh, it's all right.
She's chained up.
Peter,where do you live?
PETER:. Way out there!
WENDY:. Well, how do you find
yourway home?
You just follow
all the golden arrows.
Where do they lead you?
lt's a secret place.
Oh, please tell me.
Would you believe me
if l told you?
l promise.
PETER:. For sure?
WENDY:. For sure.
Then l'll tell you.
l have a place
where dreams are born
And time is never planned
lt's not on any charrt
You must find it with your hearrt
Never Never Land
lt might be miles
beyond the moon
Or right there where you stand
Just keep an open mind
And then suddenly you'll find
Never Never Land
You'll have a treasure
ifyou stay there
More precious farthan gold
For once you have found
yourway there
You can never, never grow old
And that's my home
where dreams are born
And time is never planned
Just think of lovely things
And your hearrt will fly on wings
Forever
ln Never Never Land
Peter,what does it look like?
lt's an island,Wendy.
A large one?
No. Quite small...
and nicely crammed...
with hardly any space between
one adventure and another.
Oh, it sounds lovely.
Who else lives there, Peter?
The Lost Boys.
Who are they?
They're the children who fall
out oftheir carriages...
when the nurse is looking
the otherway.
lfthey're not claimed
in 7 days,
they're sent far away
to Never Land.
l'm captain!
What fun it must be!
Yes...
But we're rather lonely.
Peter,why did you come
to our nursey window?
To hearthe stories.
None of us know any stories.
How perrfecctly awwful.
Wendy...
Your motherwas telling you
such a lovely stoy.
Oh? Which stoy is it?
lt was about the prince.
And he couldn't find the lady
who wore the glass slipper.
Oh. That's ''Cinderella.''
He found her.
And they lived
happily ever after.
l'm glad!
Where are you going?
-To tell the other boys!
-Oh, please don't go!
l know lots of stories.
Do you?
WENDY:. Oh,the stories
l could tell the other boys.
Come on. We'll fly.
Fly? You can fly?
Wendy, come with me.
Oh, howwe should
all respecct you.
And you could tuck us in at
night and make pockets for us.
None of us has any pockets.
Would you teach John and Michael
howto fly?
lfyou like.
John! Michael! Wake up!
There's a boy here who's going
to teach us to fly.
MICHAEL:. There is?
JOHN:. l'll get up at once.
Someone's coming. Quick! Hide!
There. You see?
They are perrfecctly safe
and sound asleep in bed.
Now, no more.
Go along,you naughty dog.
All clear!
MICHAEL:. Fly!
JOHN:. Can you really fly?
-l'll teach you.
-How lovely to fly.
l'll teach you to jum,p

and away we'll go!
-Ooh!
-Wendy,when you're sleeping...
in your silly bed,you might be
flying about with me,
saying funny things
to the stars.
MICHAEL:. How do you do it?
You just think lovely,

NARRATOR:. Second to the right
and straight on till morning.
That is the way to Never Land.
lfyou close your eyes,
you will see a pool
of lovely pale colors.
lfyou squeeze them tighter,
the pool will take on
different shapes,
and the colors
will become brighter,
so bright that in a moment,
they'll go on fire.
And in that moment
just before they do,
you will see Never Land,
a magic island on whose shores
children are forever at play.
BOY:. Now!
-Did you catch her?
-No, but look!
Tootles, has Peter
come backyet?
-No, he hasn't.
-Maybe he's waiting to hear...
the end of ''Cinderella.''
l'm always afraid
of pirates and Indians.
Yes,when Peter's not here
to protecct us.
Oh, l'm not afraid of anything.
BOYS:. Oh!
BOY:. What's that?
We massacre
Indians, kill little boys
And caterto Captain Hook
BOYS:. Pirates!
PIRRATES:. Yo-ho!
PIRRATES:. Ha!
PIRRATES:. Yo-ho! Yo-ho!
Yo-ho!
Ah! Ah!
We're bloody buccaneers, ha
And each a murderous crook, ha
We massacre Indians
kill little boys
And caterto Captain Hook
PIRRATES:. Yo-ho!
HOOK:. Yo-ho!
PIRRATES:. Yo-ho!
HOOK:. Yo-ho!
The terrible Captain Hook
-Clumsy!
-Aah!
-Butterrfingers!
-Aah!
-l'll get him, Captain!
-Aha!
Aah! No, Captain! No!
Drop that pistol first!
lt was one ofthose boys
you hate.
-l could have shot him dead.
-Aye.
And with the first crack
it will bring Tiger Lily
and her Indians.
PIRRATES:. Indians!
-Do you want to lose your scalp?
-That is true.
Shall l after him, Captain,
and tickle him
with Johnny Corkscrew?
Johnny's a silent fellow.
No, Smee.
That's only one,
and l want to mischief
all ofthem.
They must be around here
somewhere.
Scatter and lookforthem!
But most of all, l want
their captain, Peter Pan.
'Twas he cut off me arm.
l've waited long to shake hands
with him with this.
Ooh, l'll tear him.
Yet l've oft heard you say...
your hookwas worrth
a score of hands...
for combing the hair
and other homely uses.
Aye. If l were a mother,
l should pray that me children
be born with this...
instead ofthat.
But Peterthrew me hand
to a crocodile...
who happened to be passing by,
and that croc liked
the taste of me hand so much
he's followed me ever since
from land to land,
from sea to sea
he follows the ship licking
his lips forthe rest of me.
Well, in a way,
it is a sorrt of compliment.
Well, l want
no such compliments.
l want Peter Pan,who first
gave the brute his taste for me.
Smee,that crocwould have
got me long ere this...
if it could have
crept upon me unawares.
But by some lucky chance,
it swallowed a clock.
A clock!
And it goes tick-to,ck-tick
within him
and so before he can reach me
l hearthe tick and bolt!
Ha ha ha ha! Oh!
-What's the matter, Captain?
-This seat's hot. It's vey hot.
Odds, bods, hammer, and tongs,
l'm burning! Smee, help me!
SMEE:. Yes,yes.
That's enough, Smee.
Ooh! Help me.
A chimney! Smee,these boys
must be living...
Underground! Call backthe band!
l must think!
lnspire me! Play,you dogs!
SMEE:. What tempo, Captain?
Tempo,tempo,tempo...
A tango.
SMEE:. A tango!
SMEE:. Ungrip your plan, Captain.
To cook a cake quite large
And fill each layer in between
With icing mixed with poison
Till it turns a tempting green
We'll place it nearthe house
Just where the boys
are sure to come
And being greedy
They won't care
to question such a plum
The boys who have
no mother sweet
No one to showthem
their mistake
Won't know it's dangerous to eat
So damp and rich a cake
And so before
The blinking of an eye
Those boys will eat
that poison cake
And one by one
They'll die
HOOK:. Olé!
PIRRATES:. Bravo! Bravo!
Oh, no. Stop it!
-Smee! Smee!
-What's the matter, Captain?
-Smee!
HOOK:. The croc!
SMEE:. How do you know?
l can hear it ticking!
Save me, Smee! Save me!
Save me! Oh, save me, Smee!
Aah!
SMEE:. Don't leave me, Captain!
Don't leave me, Captain!
They're gone.
BOYS:. Indians!

Greetings, boys. l'm back,
and l have a great surprise.
-So do we.
-We killed a great big bird.
BOYS:. Look!
Wendy!
With an arrow in her hearrt.
This is no bird.
It's a lady.
BOYS:. A lady?
l was bringing her here
to be our mother.
And nowyou've killed her.
Whose arrow?
Mine, Peter.
Oh, dastard hand!
l cannot strike.
Something stops me.
BOY:. Look at her arm!
PETER:. She lives!
BOYS:. She lives!
See,the arrow struck
against this button.
Are you asleep,Wendy?
Thankyou.
Don't you want to get up
and play?
Howwill we get Wendy
into the house?
l know.
We'll build a house around her.
BOYS:. Ah!
PETER:. Come.
l have a plan.
We'll need lots ofwood
Need lots of leaves
Need lots of paint
But hush, hush, hush, hush
Hush
Let's be quiet as a mouse
And build a lovely little house
ForWendy
All forWendy
She's come to stay
And be our mother
At last we have a mother
''Home sweet home'' upon the wall
A welcome mat down in the hall
ForWendy
So that Wendy
Won't go away
BOYS:. We have a mother
at last we have a mother
Oh,what pleasure
she'll bring to us
Make us pockets
And sing to us
Tell us stories
we've been longing to hear
Over and over
She'll be waiting at the door
We won't be lonely anymore
Since Wendy
Lovely Wendy's here to stay
We have a mother
at last we have a mot'her
Hury up and get ready.
Bring eveything forthe house.
Quick! Quick!
Oh,thanks.
ALL:. We have a mother

Help, Peter! How do we get out?
Now! Oh!
Oh,what pleasure

We've been longing to hear
Over and over
She'll be waiting at the door
We won't be lonely anymore
Since Wendy
Lovely Wendy's here to stay
BOYS:. We have a mother
at last we have a mother
She'll be our mother
lt's nice to have a mother
Wendy's here to stay
BOYS:. Wendy lady, be our mother.
Oh, l'd love to be your mother,
provided Peter
will be the father.
Ha! All right.
As long as
it's only make-believe.
La la la la
La la la la la la la la

La la la la
La la la la
We have a mother
at last we have a mot'her
-Look! A cake!
-Oh, boy!
BOYS:. A cake!
WENDY:. Now, children
l'm sure this cake is much
too damp and rich foryou.
BOYS:. Oh! l want a piece.
Now, let's go inside,
and before l put you to sleep,
l'll have just enough time
to finish the stoy
of ''Cinderella.''
BOYS:. Ah! ''Cinderella!''
The game is up.
Those boys have found a mother.
What's a mother?
-l must think.
-What tempo, Captain?
Tempo,tempo,tempo,tempo...
-A tarantella!
-A tarantella!
Methinks
l see a spark, a gleam
A glimmer of a plan
With which perhaps l may redeem
me honor as a man
Kidnap Wendy, seize the boys,
and you'll have Hookto thank
Forwhen the time is ripe,
you see
The children walkthe plank
Oh,when was such a princely
plot concoccted by another?
To murder all the boys and keep
the Wendy for our mother
Tra la la la
Tra la la la
Tra la la la
Tra la la la
Oh, and keep the Wendy
For our mother
Yo-ho,yo-ho

Good night, Peter.

How do you do?
Oh,thankyou.

A little less noise there.
What is it, Peter?

But not really.
Well, no

Peter.
What are your exacct feelings
for me?
Those of a devoted son,Wendy.

You're so strange.
Tinker Bell's just the same.
There's something
she wants to be to me
but she says it's not my mother.
l almost agree with her.
BOY:. We're all ready
for bed now, Mother.
TOOTLES:. l brushed
my teeth.
WENDY:. Well,then
into your beds you g'o.
WENDY:. Peter?
Do you know a lullaby
to sing to our children?
Lullaby?
Lullaby.
l think so.
Sometimes, late at night...
l seem to remember...
Once upon a time and long ago
l heard someone singing
soft and low
Nowwhen day is done
and night is near
l recall this song
l used to hear
My child, my vey own
Don't be afraid
you're not alone'
Sleep until the dawn,
for all is well
Long ago,this song
was sung to me
Now it's just a distant melody
Somewhere from the past
l used to know
Once upon a time and long ago
Wendy?
WENDY:. Yes, Michael?
l'm homesick. l want to go home.
JOHN:. So do l.
Yes. We must go home.
Perhaps Motherwill be
in half mourning by this time.
TTWIN:. Oh,Wendy,
you're not leaving us?
l must. At once.
Peter, l appeal to you to make
the necessay arrangements.
All right. Tink,you are

and take Wendy on a journey
across the sea.
WENDY:. Oh, dear ones...

and fatherwould adopt you.
BOYS:. Hooray!

PETER:. All right.
BOYS:. Oh, boy!
Then put your beds away

before yourjourney.
Get yourthings, Peter.
l'm not going with you,Wendy.
Oh,yes, Peter.
-No.
-But why not?
l don't want to grow up

a little boy and have fun.
No one's gonna catch me
and make me a man.
-We're ready to go now.
-We've got our clothes.
WENDY:. Peter isn't

You're dying.
Your light is growing faint,

Yourvoice is so low

NARRRATOR:. It is night
in Never Land.
Not farfrom
the Mermaids' Lagoon,
one green light
squinting over Kidd's Creek,
which is nearthe mo,uth
ofthe Pirate River
marks where the ship
The Jolly Roger lies at anchor.
A rakish-looking craft,
fore to the hull
she lies low in the darkwater
wrapped in the blanket
ofthe night,
a cannibal ofthe seas.
How still the night is.
Nothing sounds alive.
Now is the hourwhen child,ren
in their homes are abed
their lips bright-browned
with a good-night chocolate...
and theirtongues drowsily
searching for belated crumbs...
housed insecurely
on their shining cheeks.
Compare with them,the captive
children on this boat!
Split me infinitives,
but 'tis me hour oftriumph--
Peter killed at last...
and all the boys
about to walkthe plank.
At last, l've reached me peak!

of all time!

NARRRATOR:. That was

the girl Wendy
ever saw Peter.
Years came and went without
bringing the careless boy.
Wendy tried,for Peter's sake,
not to have growing pains,
but,you see, all children
except Peter grow up.
Then...
One night, a long time after,
when it was once more
spring-cleaning time...
the stars blew open
the nursey windows.
Hello,Wendy.

WENDY:. Ha! He's not here now.
