Sold! Your number, sir?

Thank you very much.

Thank you, madam.
Twenty-five I am bid.

Selling at 30 francs, then.
Thirty once, 30 twice...
Sold for 30 francs
to the Vicomte de Chagny.
Thank you very much, sir.
Boy.
A collector's piece indeed
Every detail exactly as she said
She often spoke of you, my friend
Your velvet lining and your figurine of lead
Will you still play
when all the rest of us are dead?
Lot 666, then.
A chandelier in pieces.
Some of you may recall the strange affair
of The Phantom of the Opera,
a mystery never fully explained.
We are told, ladies and gentlemen,
that this is the very chandelier
that figures in that famous disaster.
Our workshops have restored it
and fitted parts of it with wiring
for the new electric light,
so that we may get a hint
of how it may look when reassembled.
Perhaps we may even frighten away
the ghost of so many years ago
with a little illumination, gentlemen!
This
Trophy
From our saviours
From the enslaving force
Of Rome
CHORUS:
With feasting and dancing and song
Tonight in celebration
We greet the victorious throng
Returned to bring salvation
The trumpets of Carthage resound
Hear Romans now and tremble
Hark to our step on the ground
Hear the drums, Hannibal comes
Sad to return to find the land we love
Threatened once more
by Roma's far-reaching grasp...
No, no, no, no!
Signor, if you please.
- "Rome". We say "Rome", not "Roma".
-
"Rome"? "Rome" is very hard for me.
Well, once again, if you please, signor,
"Sad to return..."
- It's very, very hard. I am from Italy.
- Just get it right, please.
PIANGI: Rome. Signor...
Sad to return to find the land we love
Threatened once more
by Rome's far-reaching grasp
Tomorrow we shall
break the chains of Rome
Tonight, rejoice
Your army
Has come home
Bid welcome to Hannibal's guests
The elephants of Carthage
As guides on our conquering quests
Dido sends
Hannibal's friends
Once more to my welcoming arms
My love returns in splendour
Once more to the sweetest of charms
My heart and soul surrender
The trumpeting elephants sound
Hear Romans now and tremble
Hark to their step on the ground
Hear the drums
Hannibal comes
REYER: Hey! Hey! We're doing that all again!
Thank you very much.
You were very good.
This song is marvellous. Thank you.
LEFEVRE: This way, gentlemen, this way.
REYER: Girls!
Rehearsals, as you see, are underway
for a new production
of Chalumeau's Hannibal.
Ladies and gentlemen...
Ladies and gentlemen, please...
Ladies and...
Madame Giry.
Thank you.
May I have your attention, please?
As you know, for some weeks
there have been rumours
about my imminent retirement.
I can now tell you, these were all true,
and it is now my pleasure to introduce you
to the two gentlemen
who now own the Opera Populaire,
Monsieur Richard Firmin
and Monsieur Giles André.
-
- ANDRÉ: Oh, no, please.
Gentlemen, Signora Carlotta Giudicelli,
our leading soprano for 19 seasons now.
Of course, of course, I have experienced
all your greatest roles, signora.
And Signor Ubaldo Piangi.
An honour, signor.
If I remember rightly,
Elissa has a rather fine aria
in Act Three of Hannibal.
I wonder, signora, if, as a personal favour,
you would oblige us with a private rendition?
Unless, of course, Monsieur Reyer objects...
No, my manager commands!
My diva commands.
Would two bars be sufficient introduction?
Two bars will be quite sufficient.
REYER: Signora?
Think of me
Think of me fondly
When we've said goodbye
Remember me
Every so often
Promise me you'll try
On that day, that not so distant day
When you are far away and free
If you ever find a moment
Spare a thought for me
Think of me
Think of me warmly...
He's here, The Phantom of the Opera
He's there, The Phantom of the Opera
CHORUS:  He is with us
It's the ghost
Good heavens, will you show a little courtesy!
Mademoiselle, please!
LEFEVRE: Signora! Are you all right?
Buquet! Where is Buquet?
Get that man down here!
Buquet, chief of the flys.
He's responsible for this.
Buquet! For God's sake, man,
what's going on up there?
Please, monsieur, don't look at me
As God's my witness, I was not at my post
Please, monsieur, there's no one there
And if there is,
well, then, it must be a ghost
-
-
He's there, The Phantom of the Opera
Good heavens!
I have never known such insolence.
Signora, please.
These things do happen.
"These things do happen"?
You have been here five minutes!
What do you know?
Si, these things do happen,
all the time!
For the past three years,
these things do happen.
And did you stop them happening? No!
And you... You're as bad as him.
"These things do happen."
Well, until you stop these things happening,
this thing does not happen!
Ubaldo, andiamo!
Amateurs!
I don't think there's much more I can do
to assist you, gentlemen. Good luck.
If you need me, I  shall be in Frankfurt.
But, monsieur...
LEFEVRE: Move, please. Out of the way.
Oh...
La Carlotta will be back.
You think so, monsieur?
Yes.
I have a message, sir, from the Opera Ghost.
Oh, God in heaven, you're all obsessed!
He merely welcomes you to his opera house.
Commands that you continue
to leave Box Five empty for his use,
and reminds you that his salary is due.
His salary?
Monsieur Lefevre paid him
Perhaps you could afford more,
with the Vicomte de Chagny as your patron.
Madame, I had hoped to have made
that announcement myself.
Will the Vicomte be at the performance
this evening, monsieur?
In our box.
Madame, who is the understudy for the role?
There is no understudy, monsieur.
The production is new.
Christine Daaé could sing it, sir.
A ballet girl?
Well, she's been taking lessons
from a great teacher.
Oh, from whom?
I don't know, sir.
Oh, not you as well. Can you believe it?
A full house, and we have to cancel!
Daaé? That's a curious name.
Any relation to the violinist?
My father, sir.
Let her sing for you, monsieur.
She has been well taught.
Very well.
Oh, from the beginning
of the aria then, mam'selle.
Gentlemen, please.
Think of me
Think of me fondly
When we've said goodbye
Remember me
Every so often
Promise me you'll try
André, this is doing nothing for my nerves.
Don't fret, Firmin.
On that day, that not so distant day
When you are far away and free
If you ever find a moment
Spare a thought for me
REYER: Madame! Monsieur!
Thank you. Thank you so much.
And though it's clear
Though it was always clear
That this was never meant to be
If you happen to remember
Stop and think of me
Think of August
When the world was green
Don't think about the way
Things might have been
Think of me
Think of me waking
Silent and resigned
Imagine me
Trying too hard
To put you from my mind
Think of me
Please say you'll think of me
Whatever else you choose to do
There will never be a day
When I won't think of you
Can it be?
Can it be Christine?
Brava! Brava!
Long ago
It seems so long ago
How young and innocent we were
She may not remember me
But I remember her
Flowers fade
The fruits of summer fade
They have their seasons
So do we
But please promise me
That sometimes
You will think
Of me
MAN: Brava! Brava!
Christine Daaé, that was unbelievable.
-
-
Yes, you did well.
He will be pleased.
And, you! You were a disgrace!
Such ronds de jambes! Such temps de cuisse!
Come! We rehearse. Now!
PHANTOM:  Brava
Brava
Bravissima
MEG:  Christine
Christine
PHANTOM:  Christine
Where in the world have you been hiding?
Really, you were perfect
I only wish I knew your secret
Who is this new tutor?
Father once spoke of an angel
I used to dream he'd appear
Now as I sing I can sense him
And I know he's here
Here in this room, he calls me softly
Somewhere inside, hiding
Somehow I know he's always with me
He, the unseen genius
I watched your face from the shadows
Distant through all the applause
I hear your voice in the darkness
Yet the words aren't yours
Angel of Music, guide and guardian
-  Grant to me your glory
-  Who is this angel?
BOTH:  This Angel of Music hide no longer
Secret and strange angel
-  He's with me even now
-  Your hands are cold
-  All around
-  Your face, Christine, it's white
-  It frightens me
-  Don't be frightened
Meg Giry. Are you a dancer?
Then go and practice.
My dear, I was asked to give you this.
Thank you.
"A red scarf. The attic. Little Lotte."
ANDRÉ: A tour de force!
There's no other way to describe it!
What a relief! Not a single refund!
Greedy.
Richard, I think we've made
quite a discovery with Miss Daaé!
FIRMIN: Here we are, Monsieur Vicomte.
Gentlemen, if you wouldn't mind.
This is one visit I should prefer
to make unaccompanied.
As you wish, monsieur.
- They appear to have met before.
-
Christine Daaé, where is your red scarf?
- Monsieur?
- Well, you can't have lost it.
After all the trouble I took.
I was just 14 and soaked to the skin...
Because you had run into the sea
to fetch my scarf.
- Oh, Raoul. So it is you.
- Christine.
Little Lotte, let her mind wander
You remember that, too?
Little Lotte thought, am I fonder of dolls
BOTH:  Or of goblins, of shoes
Or of riddles, of frocks
Those picnics in the attic.
Or of chocolates?
Father playing the violin.
As we read to each other
dark stories of the north.
"No, what I love best," Lotte said
"Is when I'm asleep in my bed
"And the Angel of Music
sings songs in my head
BOTH:  "The Angel of Music
sings songs in my head"
Father said, "When I'm in heaven, child,
"I will send the Angel of Music to you."
Well, Father is dead, Raoul,
and I have been visited by the Angel of Music.
No doubt of it. And now, we go to supper.
No, Raoul, the Angel of Music is very strict.
- I shan't keep you up late.
- No...
You must change. I must get my hat.
Two minutes... Little Lotte.
Raoul!
Things have changed, Raoul.
PHANTOM:
Insolent boy, the slave of fashion
Basking in your glory
Ignorant fool, this brave young suitor
Sharing in my triumph
Angel, I hear you
Speak, I listen
Stay by my side, guide me
Angel, my soul was weak, forgive me
Enter at last, master
PHANTOM:
Flattering child, you shall know me
See why in shadow I hide
Look at your face in the mirror
I am there inside
Angel of Music, guide and guardian
Grant to me your glory
Angel of Music, hide no longer
Come to me, strange angel
I am your Angel of Music
Come to me, Angel of Music
I am your Angel of Music
Come to me, Angel of Music
Christine!
CHRISTINE:  In sleep he sang to me
In dreams he came
That voice which calls to me
And speaks my name
And do I dream again
For now I find
The Phantom of the Opera is there
Inside my mind
PHANTOM:  Sing once again with me
Our strange duet
My power over you
Grows stronger yet
And though you turn from me
To glance behind
The Phantom of the Opera is there
Inside your mind
Those who have seen your face
Draw back in fear
I am the mask you wear
It's me they hear
CHRISTINE:  My spirit and my voice
PHANTOM:  Your spirit and your voice
BOTH:  In one combined
The Phantom of the Opera is there
CHRISTINE:  Inside my mind
PHANTOM:  Inside your mind
CHORUS:  He's there,
The Phantom of the Opera
Beware, The Phantom of the Opera
In all your fantasies
You always knew
That man and mystery
Were both in you
BOTH:  And in this labyrinth
Where night is blind
The Phantom of the Opera is there
Inside my mind
Inside your mind
Sing for me
My Angel of Music!
He's there, The Phantom of the Opera
- Sing!
-
Sing!
Sing for me!
I have brought you
To the seat of sweet music's throne
To this kingdom
where all must pay homage to music
Music
You have come here
For one purpose and one alone
Since the moment I first heard you sing
I have needed you with me to serve me
To sing for my music
My music
Night-time sharpens
Heightens each sensation
Darkness stirs
And wakes imagination
Silently the senses
Abandon their defenses
Slowly, gently
Night unfurls its splendour
Grasp it, sense it
Tremulous and tender
Turn your face away
From the garish light of day
Turn your thoughts away
From cold, unfeeling light
And listen to the music
Of the night
Close your eyes and surrender
To your darkest dreams
Purge your thoughts
Of the life you knew before
Close your eyes
Let your spirit start to soar
And you'll live
As you've never lived before
Softly, deftly
Music shall surround you
Hear it, feel it
Closing in around you
Open up your mind
Let your fantasies unwind
In this darkness
Which you know you cannot fight
The darkness of the music
Of the night
Let your mind start a journey
through a strange new world
Leave all thoughts of the world
you knew before
Let your soul
Take you where you long to be
Only then
Can you belong
To me
Floating, falling
Sweet intoxication
Touch me, trust me
Savour each sensation
Let the dream begin
Let your darker side give in
To the power of the music
That I write
The power of the music
Of the night
You alone can make
My song take flight
Help me make the music
Of the
Night
I remember there was mist
Swirling mist upon a vast, glassy lake
There were candles all around
And on the lake there was a boat
And in the boat there was a man
Who was that shape in the shadows?
Whose is that face in the mask?
Damn you! You little prying Pandora
You little demon
Is this what you wanted to see?
Curse you!
-
You little lying Delilah!
You little viper
Now you cannot ever be free
Damn you!
Curse you!
Stranger than you dreamt it
Can you even dare to look
Or bear to think of me
This loathsome gargoyle who burns in hell
But secretly yearns for heaven
Secretly, secretly
But, Christine
Fear can turn to love
You'll learn to see
To find the man behind the monster
This repulsive carcass
Who seems a beast
But secretly dreams of beauty
Secretly, secretly
Oh, Christine...
No.
Come, we must return
Those two fools who run my theatre
will be missing you
- GIRL: Let's go this way:
-
- Quick! Come this way!
-
Like yellow parchment is his skin
A great black hole serves as the nose
which never grew
You must be always on your guard
Or he will catch you with his magical lasso
-
-
GIRY:  Those who speak of what they know
Find too late that prudent silence is wise
Joseph Buquet hold your tongue
He will burn you with the heat of his eyes
"Mystery after gala night"
It says, "Mystery of soprano's flight"
"Mystified," baffled Sûreté say
"We are mystified
We suspect foul play"
Bad news on soprano scene
First Carlotta, now Christine
Still, at least the seats get sold
Gossip's worth its weight in gold
Diva tenders resignation
Cover does a moonlight flit
Half your cast disappears,
but the crowd still cheers
Opera, to hell with Gluck and Handel
Have a scandal and you're sure to have a hit
Damnable, will they all walk out?
This is damnable
André, please don't shout
It's publicity
And the take is vast
Free publicity
But we have no cast
But, André, have you seen the queue?
Oh, it seems you've got one, too
Hmm.
"Dear André, what a charming gala
"Christine enjoyed a great success
"We were hardly bereft when Carlotta left
"Otherwise, the chorus was entrancing
"But the dancing was a lamentable mess"
"Dear Firmin, just a brief reminder
"My salary has not been paid
"Send it care of the Ghost by return of post
"PTO, no one likes a debtor
"So it's better if my orders are obeyed"
BOTH:
Who would have the gall to send this?
Someone with a puerile brain
These are both signed "O.G."
Who the hell is he?
BOTH:  Opera Ghost
-  It's really not amusing
-  He's abusing our position
-  In addition he wants money
-  He's a funny sort of spectre
BOTH:  To expect a large retainer
Nothing plainer
He is clearly quite insane
-  Where is she?
-  You mean Carlotta?
I mean Miss Daaé
Where is she?
-  Well, how should we know?
-  I want an answer
-  I take it that you sent me this note
-  What's all this nonsense?
-  Of course not
-  Don't look at us
-  She's not with you then?
-  Of course not
-  We're in the dark
-  Monsieur, don't argue
Isn't this the letter you wrote?
And what is it
that we're meant to have wrote?
Written?
"Do not fear for Miss Daaé
"The Angel of Music has her under his wing
"Make no attempt to see her again"
Well, if you didn't write it, who did?
Where is he?
-  Ah, welcome back
-  Your precious patron
-  Where is he?
-  What is it now?
I have your letter
A letter which I rather resent
-  Did you send it?
-  Of course not
ANDRÉ:  As if he would
-  You didn't send it?
-  Of course not
-  What's going on?
You dare to tell me
that this is not the letter you sent?
And what is it that I'm meant to have sent?
"Your days at the Opera Populaire
are numbered
"Christine Daaé will be singing
on your behalf tonight
"Be prepared for a great misfortune
"Should you attempt to take her place"
BOTH:  Far too many notes for my taste
And most of them about Christine
All we've heard since we came
is Miss Daaé's name
Miss Daaé has returned
In which case I think
our meeting is adjourned
Where precisely is she now?
I thought it best that she went home
She needed rest
May I see her?
No, monsieur, she will see no one
Will she sing?
Will she sing?
Here, I have a note
ALL:  Let me see it
-  Please!
"Gentlemen, I have now sent you
several notes of the most amiable nature,
"detailing how my theatre is to be run."
Hmm.
"You have not followed my instructions."
- "I shall give you one last chance..."
- PHANTOM: I shall give you one last chance:
Christine Daaé has returned to you
And I am anxious
her career should progress
In the new production of El Muto
You will therefore cast Carlotta
as the pageboy
And put Miss Daaé in the role of Countess
The role which Miss Daaé plays
calls for charm and appeal
The role of the pageboy is silent
Which makes my casting, in a word, ideal
I shall watch the performance
from my normal seat in Box Five,
which will be kept empty for me:
- Should these commands be ignored...
- "Should these commands be ignored,
"a disaster beyond your imagination
will occur.
"I remain, gentlemen,
your obedient servant, O.G."
Christine, Christine
-  Christine!
-  Whatever next
It's all a ploy to help Christine
-  This is insane
-  I know who sent this
The Vicomte, her lover
Indeed? Can you believe this?
-  Signora!
-  How can you do this?
O traditori
O mentitori
-  Signora!
-  You are our star
And always will be
-  Signora!
-  The man is mad
-  We don't take orders
-  Miss Daaé will be playing the pageboy
The silent role
Carlotta will be playing the lead
You don't deserve her!
-  It's useless trying to appease me
-  Appease her
-  You're only saying this to please me
-  To please her
Signori, è vero?
BOTH:  No, no, non voglio udire!
Lasciatemi morire!
O Padre mio! Dio!
Who scorn his word, beware to those
The Angel sees
Why did Christine fly from my arms?
The Angel knows
You have rebuked me
MANAGERS:  Signora, pardon us
You have replaced me
BOTH:  Please, signora, we beseech you
GIRY:  This hour shall see your darkest fears
-  I must see her
The Angel knows
The Angel hears
Abbandonata, desiderata
O, sventura, disgraziata
Signora, sing for us
-  Abbandonata
-  Don't be unfeeling
-  What new surprises are in store?
-  Our star
Your public needs you
We need you, too
Would you not rather
have your precious little ingénue?
BOTH:  Signora, no
The world wants you
Prima donna, first lady of the stage
Your devotees are on their knees
to implore you
Can you bow out
when they're shouting your name?
Think of how they all adore you
Prima donna, enchant us once again
Think of your muse
And of the queues round the theatre
Can you deny us the triumph in store?
Sing, prima donna, once more
RAOUL:  Christine spoke of an angel
Prima donna, your song shall live again
You took a snub
Think of your public
But there's a public who needs you
Those who hear your voice
liken you to an angel
Think of their cry of undying support
RAOUL:  Is this the Angel of Music?
We get our opera
She gets her limelight
Follow where the limelight leads you
Leading ladies are a trial
Prima donna, your song will never die
You'll sing again
and to an unending ovation
Think how you'll shine in that final encore
Sing, prima donna, once more
ALL:  ...demands are rejected
Who'd believe a diva
happy to relieve a chorus girl
Who's gone and slept with the patron?
Raoul and the soubrette
entwined in love's duet
Although he may demur
He must have been with her
You'd never get away with all this in a play
But if it's loudly sung
and in a foreign tongue
It's just the sort of story audiences adore
In fact a perfect opera
For if his curse is on this opera
Prima donna, the world is at your feet
A nation waits
and how it hates to be cheated
Light up the stage with that age-old rapport
Sing, prima donna
Once more
PHANTOM: So, it is to be war between us.
If these demands are not met,
a disaster beyond imagination will occur!
ALL:  Once more
RAOUL: Gentlemen, if you would care to take
your seats? We shall be sitting in Box Five.
ANDRÉ: Do you really think
that's wise, monsieur?
RAOUL: My dear André, there would appear
to be no seats available other than Box Five.
They say that this youth
has set my lady's heart aflame
His Lordship sure would die of shock
His Lordship is a laughing stock
Should he suspect her, God protect her
ALL:  Shame, shame, shame
This faithless lady's bound for Hades
Shame, shame, shame
Serafimo, your disguise is perfect
Why, who can this be?
Gentle wife, admit your loving husband
ANDRÉ: Every seat sold!
FIRMIN: Hardly a disaster
beyond imagination.
My love, I am called to England
on affairs of State
And must leave you with your new maid
Though I'd happily take the maid with me.
The old fool's leaving.
I suspect my young bride is untrue to me
I shall not leave but shall hide over there
To observe her
Addio
BOTH:  Addio
Serafimo, away with this pretence
You cannot speak
But kiss me in my husband's absence
Poor fool, he makes me laugh
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Time I tried to get a better, better half
ALL:  Poor fool, he doesn't know
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho
If he knew the truth he'd never ever go
PHANTOM:  Did I not instruct
that Box Five was to be kept empty?
He's here, The Phantom of the Opera
It's him, I know it. It's him.
-
- Calm down.
Your part is silent, little toad!
PHANTOM: A toad, madame?
Perhaps it is you who are the toad.
Maestro, da capo, per piacere.
Serafimo, away with this pretence
You cannot speak, but kiss me in my...
Poor fool, he makes me laugh
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
PIANGI: Maestro! Maestro, no!
PHANTOM: Behold!
She is singing to bring down the chandelier!
FIRMIN: Ladies and gentlemen, we apologise.
The performance will continue
in 10 minutes' time,
when the role of the Countess
will be sung by Miss Christine Daaé.
Ladies and gentlemen!
Oh:
In the meantime, ladies and gentlemen,
we shall be giving you the ballet...
Uh, from Act...
...Three of tonight's opera.
Maestro, bring the ballet forward.
The ballet. Now!
Ladies and gentlemen,
please remain in your seats.
Do not panic. It was an accident.
Simply an accident.
-  Why have you brought us here?
-  Don't take me back there
-  We must return
-  He'll kill me
-  His eyes will find me there
-  Christine, don't say that
-  Those eyes that burn
-  Don't even think it
-  And if he has to kill a thousand men
-  Forget this waking nightmare
-  The Phantom of the Opera will kill again
-  The Phantom is a fable
Believe me,
there is no Phantom of the Opera
My God, who is this man?
My God, who is this man?
-  Who hunts to kill
-  This mask of death
-  I can't escape from him
-  Whose is this voice you hear
-  I never will
-  With every breath?
BOTH:  And in this labyrinth
where night is blind
-  The Phantom of the Opera is here
-  The Phantom of the Opera is there
-  Inside my mind
-  Inside your mind
There is no Phantom of the Opera
Raoul, I've been there
To his world of unending night
To a world where the daylight dissolves
into darkness
Darkness
Raoul, I've seen him
Can I ever forget that sight?
Can I ever escape from that face?
So distorted, deformed
It was hardly a face in that darkness
Darkness
But his voice filled my spirit
With a strange, sweet sound
In that night there was music
In my mind
And through music
My soul began to soar
And I heard
-  As I'd never heard before
-  What you heard was
A dream and nothing more
Yet in his eyes
All the sadness of the world
Those pleading eyes
That both threaten
And adore
Christine, Christine
PHANTOM:  Christine
What was that?
Christine, come here.
No more talk of darkness
Forget these wide-eyed fears
I'm here, nothing will harm you
My words will warm and calm you
Let me be your freedom
Let daylight dry your tears
I'm here, with you, beside you
To guard you and to guide you
Say you'll love me every waking moment
Turn my head with talk of summertime
Say you need me with you, now and always
Promise me that all you say is true
That's all I ask of you
Let me be your shelter
Let me be your light
You're safe, no one can find you
Your fears are far behind you
All I want is freedom
A world with no more night
And you always beside me
To hold me and to hide me
Then say you'll share with me one love
One lifetime
Let me lead you from your solitude
Say you need me with you
Here beside you
Anywhere you go, let me go, too
Christine, that's all I ask of you
Say you'll share with me one love
One lifetime
Say the word and I will follow you
Share each day with me
Each night, each morning
Say you love me
You know I do
BOTH:  Love me
That's all I ask of you
Anywhere you go, let me go, too
Love me
That's all I ask
Of you
I must go
They'll wonder where I am
Wait for me, Raoul
Christine, I love you
Order your fine horses
Be with them at the door
And soon you'll be beside me
You'll guard me and you'll guide me
I gave you my music
Made your song take wing
And now
How you've repaid me
Denied me and betrayed me
He was bound to love you
When he heard you sing
Christine...
CHRISTINE AND RAOUL:
Say you'll share with me one love
One lifetime
Say the word
And I will follow you
Share each day with me
Each night, each morning
You will curse the day you did not do
All that the Phantom
Asked of you
Monsieur Firmin?
Monsieur André?
Dear André, what a splendid party
The prologue to a bright new year
Quite a night, I'm impressed
Well, one does one's best
BOTH:  Here's to us
A toast to all the city
Such a pity that The Phantom can't be here
ALL:  Masquerade
Paper faces on parade
Masquerade
Hide your face
so the world will never find you
Masquerade
Every face a different shade
Masquerade
Look around
There's another mask behind you
Flash of mauve
Splash of puce
Fool and king
Ghoul and goose
Green and black
Queen and priest
Trace of rouge
Face of beast
Faces
Take your turn
Take a ride
On the merry-go-round
In an inhuman race
-  Thigh of blue
-  True is false
-  Who is who
-  Curl of lip
-  Swirl of gown
-  Ace of hearts
Face of clown
ALL:  Faces
Drink it in
Drink it up
Till you've drowned in the light
In the sound
BOTH:  But who can name the face?
ALL:  Masquerade
Grinning yellows
Spinning reds
Masquerade
Take your fill
Let the spectacle astound you
Masquerade
Burning glances
Turning heads
Masquerade
Stop and stare
At the sea of smiles around you
Masquerade
Seething shadows
Breathing lies
Masquerade
You can fool
Any friend who ever knew you
Masquerade
Leering satyrs
Peering eyes
Masquerade
Run and hide
But the face will still pursue you
-  What a night
MEG:  What a crowd
ANDRÉ:  Makes you glad
-  Makes you proud
-  All the créme de la créme
-  Watching us
-  And watching them
-  And all our fears are in the past
ANDRÉ:  Six months
PIANGI:  Of relief
CARLOTTA:  Of delight
ANDRÉ:  Of Elysian peace
And we can breathe at last
-  No more notes
-  No more ghost
-  Here's a health
-  Here's a toast
-  To a prosperous year
-  To the new chandelier
And may its splendour never fade
-  What a change
-  What a blessed release
And what a masquerade
Think of it
A secret engagement
Look, your future bride
Just think of it
But why is it secret?
What have we to hide?
-  You promised me
-  You promised me
No, Raoul, please don't
They'll see
Well, let them see
It's an engagement, not a crime
Christine, what are you afraid of?
-  Let's not argue
-  Let's not argue
-  Please pretend
-  I can only hope
-  You will understand in time
-  I'll understand in time
Masquerade
Paper faces on parade
Masquerade
Hide your face
So the world will never find you
Masquerade
Every face a different shade
Masquerade
Look around
There's another mask behind you
Masquerade
Burning glances

Masquerade
Take your fill
Let the spectacle astound you
Why so silent, good messieurs?
Did you think that I had left you for good?
Have you missed me, good messieurs?
I have written you an opera
Here I bring the finished score
Don Juan Triumphant
I advise you to comply
My instructions should be clear
Remember there are worse things
than a shattered chandelier
Your chains are still mine
You will sing for me
Madame Giry?
- Madame Giry!
- Monsieur, don't ask me.
I know no more than anyone else.
That's not true.
You know something, don't you?
I know nothing.
Please, monsieur, don't ask me.
Madame, for all our sakes.
Very well.
It was years ago.
There was a travelling fair in the city.
Tumblers, conjurers, human oddities.
- Go on.
- And there was...
I shall never forget him.
A man locked in a cage.
- In a cage?
- Aprodigy, monsieur.
Scholar, architect, musician.
- A composer.
- And an inventor, too, monsieur.
They boasted he had once built
for the Shah of Persia
- a maze of mirrors.
- Who was this man?
A freak of nature
More monster than man
- Deformed?
- From birth it seemed.
- My God.
- Then he went missing.
- He escaped.
- Go on.
They never found him
It was said he had died
But he didn't die, did he?
The world forgot him
But I never can
For in this darkness
-  I have seen him again
-  And so our phantom's this man?
I have said too much, monsieur, too much.
- No! Wait!
- And there have been too many accidents.
Accidents? Madame Giry!
Ludicrous
Have you seen the score?
Simply ludicrous
It's the final straw
This is lunacy
Well, you know my views
Utter lunacy
But we daren't refuse
Not another chandelier
Look, my friend, what we have here
"Dear André,
Re my orchestrations
"We need another first bassoon
"Every note's overblown
"And that third trombone has to go
"The man could not be deafer
"So please preferably
one who plays in tune"
"Dear Firmin,
Vis-à-vis my opera
"Some chorus members must be sacked
"If you could find out which
has a sense of pitch
"Wisely though
"I've managed to assign a rather minor role
-  "To those who cannot act"
-  Outrage!
-  What is it now?
-  This whole affair
-  Is an outrage
-  Signora, please
-  Now what's the matter?
-  Have you seen the size of my part?
-  Signora, listen
-  It's an insult
-  Not you as well
-  Just look at this
It's an insult
-  Please understand
-  Signor, Signora
The things I have to do for my art
If you can call this gibberish "art"!
Ah, here's our little flower
Ah, Miss Daaé
Quite the lady of the hour
You have secured
the largest role in this Don Juan
Christine Daaé
She doesn't have the voice
Signora, please
-  Then I take it you're agreeing
-  She's behind this
It appears we have no choice
She's the one behind this
Christine Daaé
-  How dare you?
-  I'm not a fool
You evil woman
How dare you?
-  You think I'm blind?
-  This isn't my fault
I don't want any part in this plot
-  Miss Daaé, surely
-  But why not?
PIANGI:  What does she say?
-  It's your decision
-  But why not?
-  She's backing out
ANDRÉ:  You have a duty
I cannot sing it, duty or not
Christine, Christine
You don't have to
They can't make you
Please, monsieur. Another note.
"Fondest greetings to you all
"A few instructions
just before rehearsal starts
"Carlotta must be taught to act
"Not her normal trick of..."
PHANTOM:  Not her normal trick of
Strutting round the stage
Our Don Juan must lose some weight
It's not healthy in a man of Piangi's age
And my managers must learn
That their place is in an office
Not the arts
As for Miss Christine Daaé
No doubt she'll do her best
It's true her voice is good
She knows
Though should she wish to excel
She has much still to learn
If pride will let her return to me
Her teacher, her teacher
- Your obedient friend.
- "...and Angel"
I can't. I won't do it.
We have all been blind
And yet the answer is staring us in the face
This could be the chance
To ensnare our clever friend
We're listening
Go on
We shall play his game
Perform his work
But remember we hold the ace
For if Miss Daaé sings
He is certain to attend
We make certain the doors are barred
We make certain our men are there
RAOUL:  We make certain they're armed
The curtain falls
His reign will end
-  Madness!
-  I'm not so sure
-  Not if it works
-  This is madness
The tide will turn
Monsieur, believe me
There is no way of turning the tide
-  You stick to ballet
-  Then help us
-  Monsieur, I can't
-  Instead of warning us
ALL:  Help us!
-  I wish I could
MANAGERS:  Don't make excuses
Or could it be that you're on his side?
She's his accomplice
Monsieur, believe me, I intend no ill
But, messieurs, be careful
We have seen him kill
MANAGERS:  We'll say he'll fall
And fall he will
She's the one behind this
Christine
-  This is the truth
-  This is all her doing
PIANGI:  Christine Daaé
-  This is his undoing
MANAGERS:  If you succeed, you free us all
-  Angel of Music, fear my fury
-  This so-called "Angel" has to fall
GIRY:  Hear my warning
Hear his fury
Please don't
If you don't stop this, I'll go mad!
Raoul, I'm frightened
Don't make me do this
Raoul, it scares me
Don't put me through this ordeal by fire
He'll take me, I know
We'll be parted forever
He won't let me go
What I once used to dream, I now dread
If he finds me, it won't ever end
And he'll always be there
Singing songs in my head
He'll always be there
Singing songs in my head
She's mad.
You said yourself
He was nothing but a man
Yet while he lives
He will haunt us till we're dead
Twisted every way
What answer can I give?
Am I to risk my life
to win the chance to live?
Can I betray the man
who once inspired my voice?
Do I become his prey?
Do I have any choice?
He kills without a thought
He murders all that's good
I know I can't refuse
And yet I wish I could
Oh, God, if I agree
What horrors wait for me?
In this, The Phantom's opera
Christine, Christine
Don't think that I don't care
But every hope and every prayer
Rests on you now
I can't!
Christine!
So, it is to be war between us!
But this time, my clever friend,
the disaster will be yours!
ALL:  Hide your sword now, wounded knight
Your vainglorious gasconade
Brought you to your final fight
For your pride, high price you've paid
Silken couch and hay-filled barn
Both have been his battlefield
Those who tangle with Don Juan
No, no, no!
Chorus, rest, please.
Don Juan: Signor Piangi.
- Si.
- REYER: This is the phrase:
Those who tangle with Don Juan
If you please.
Those who tangle with Don Juan
Nearly, but no
Those who tang! Tang! Tang!
Those who tang! Tang! Tang!
His way is better.
At least he makes it sound like music.
Signora, would you speak that way
in the presence of the composer?
The composer is not here.
- And if he were here, I would...
- Can you be certain of that,
signora?
Once again, if you please, Signor Piangi.
After seven.
Five, six, seven...
Those who have been
tangling with Don Juan
What does it matter what notes we sing?
No one will know if it is right or wrong.
No one will care.
ALL:  Poor young maiden
For the thrill on your tongue
of stolen sweets
You will have to pay the bill
Tangled in the winding sheets
In sleep he sang to me
In dreams he came
That voice which calls to me
And speaks my name
Little Lotte thought of
everything and nothing
Her father promised her that
he would send her the Angel of Music
Her father promised her
Her father promised her
You were once
My one companion
You were all that mattered
You were once a friend and father
Then my world was shattered
Wishing you were somehow here again
Wishing you were somehow near
Sometimes it seemed
If I just dreamed
Somehow you would be here
Wishing I could hear your voice again
Knowing that I never would
Dreaming of you won't help me to do
All that you dreamed I could
Passing bells and sculpted angels
Cold and monumental
Seemed for you the wrong companions
You were warm and gentle
Too many years, fighting back tears
Why can't the past just die?
Wishing you were somehow here again
Knowing we must say goodbye
Try to forgive, teach me to live
Give me the strength to try
No more memories
No more silent tears
No more gazing across
The wasted years
Help me say
Goodbye
Help me say
Goodbye
Wandering child
So lost, so helpless
Yearning for my guidance
Angel or father
Friend or phantom
Who is it there, staring?
Have you forgotten your angel?
Angel, oh, speak
What endless longings
Echo in this whisper
Too long you've wandered in winter
Once again she is his
Far from my fathering gaze
Once again she returns
Wildly my mind beats against you
-  You resist yet your soul obeys
-  Yet my soul obeys
Into the arms of her...
-  Angel of Music, I denied you
-  Angel of Music, you denied me
Angel or demon, still he calls her
-  Turning from true beauty
-  Turning from true beauty
Luring her back from the grave
-  Angel of Music, my protector
-  Angel of Music, do not shun me
RAOUL:  Angel or dark seducer
Who are you strange angel?
Come to me strange angel
Come to me strange angel
I am your Angel of Music
Come to me, Angel of Music
Angel of darkness, cease this torment!
I am your Angel of Music
Christine! Christine!
Listen to me, whatever you may believe,
this man...
This... This thing is not your father.
I am your Angel of Music
Let her go. For God's sake, let her go!
Come to me, Angel of Music
- Christine!
- Raoul!
Bravo, monsieur, such spirited words.
- More tricks, monsieur?
- Let's see, monsieur, how far you dare go.
- More deception, more violence?
- That's right, that's right,
keep walking this way.
You can't win her love
by making her your prisoner.
I'm here: I'm here, monsieur.
The angel of death.
Come on. Come on. Don't stop. Don't stop.
So be it.
Now, let it be war upon you both!
You understand your instructions?
When you hear the whistle,
take up your positions.
I shall then instruct you
to secure the doors.
It is essential that
all doors are properly secured.
André, are we doing the right thing?
Well, have you got a better idea?
Monsieur Vicomte, am I to give the order?
Give the order.
You, in the pit, do you have
a clear view of that box?
Yes, sir.
Remember, when the time comes, shoot.
Only if you have to, but shoot to kill.
- How will I know, sir?
- You'll know.
Monsieur le Vicomte,
are you confident this will work?
- Will Miss Daaé sing?
- Don't worry, Firmin: André?
We're in your hands, monsieur.
My men are now in position, sir.
Go ahead, then.
Are the doors secure?
-
- MAN 1: Secure!
MAN 2: Secure!
MAN 3: Secure!
MAN 4: Secure!
MAN 5: Secure!
PHANTOM:  I'm here,
The Phantom of the Opera
I'm here, The Phantom of the Opera
I'm here. I'm here. I'm here!
-
- Idiot! I said only when the time comes!
- But, Monsieur le Vicomte.
- PHANTOM: No "buts"!
For once, Monsieur Vicomte is right.
Seal my fate tonight
I hate to have to cut the fun short
But the joke's wearing thin
Let my opera begin
ALL:  Here the sire may serve the dam
Here the master takes his meat
Here the sacrificial lamb
Utters one despairing bleat
Poor young maiden
For the thrill on your tongue
of stolen sweets
You will have to pay the bill
Tangled in the winding sheets
Serve the meal and serve the maid
Serve the meal and serve the maid
Serve the master so that
When tables, plans and maids are laid
Don Juan triumphs
Once again
-
-  Shoo!
Passarino, faithful friend
Once again recite the plan
Your young guest believes I'm you
I the master, you the man
When you met, you wore my cloak
She could not have seen your face
She believes she dines with me
In her master's borrowed place
Furtively we'll scoff and quaff
Stealing what in truth is mine
When it's late and modesty
Starts to mellow with the wine
You come home
I use your voice
Slam the door like crack of doom
I will say, "Come hide with me
"Where, oh, where? Of course, my room"
Poor thing hasn't got a chance
Here's my hat, my cloak and sword
Conquest is assured
if I do not forget myself and laugh
Ha! Ha! Ha!
No thoughts within her head
But thoughts of joy
No dreams within her heart
But dreams of love
PASSARINO:  Master?
PHANTOM:  Passarino
Go away, for the trap is set
And waits for its prey
You have come here
In pursuit of your deepest urge
In pursuit of that wish
Which till now has been silent, silent
I have brought you
That our passion may fuse and merge
In your mind
you've already succumbed to me
Dropped all defenses
Completely succumbed to me
Now you are here with me
No second thoughts
You've decided
Decided
Past the point of no return
No backward glances
Our games of make believe
Are at an end
Past all thought of "if" or "when"
No use resisting
Abandon thought
And let the dream descend
What raging fire shall flood the soul
What rich desire unlocks its door
What sweet seduction lies before us
Past the point of no return
The final threshold
What warm unspoken secrets
Will we learn?
Beyond the point
Of no return
You have brought me
To that moment when words run dry
To that moment when speech
Disappears into silence
Silence
I have come here
Hardly knowing the reason why
In my mind
I've already imagined our bodies entwining
Defenseless and silent
And now I am here with you
No second thoughts
I've decided
Decided
Past the point of no return
No going back now
Our passion play has now
At last begun
Past all thought of right or wrong
One final question
How long should we two wait
Before we're one?
When will the blood begin to race?
The sleeping bud burst into bloom?
When will the flames at last
Consume us?
BOTH:  Past the point of no return
The final threshold
The bridge is crossed
So stand and watch it burn
We've passed the point
Of no return
Say you'll share with me
One love, one lifetime
Lead me, save me
From my solitude
Say you want me
With you here
Beside you
Anywhere you go
Let me go, too
Christine
That's all I ask of...
No!
RAOUL: No! Don't shoot!
No! What are you doing there?
Give me this, monsieur. Get water, monsieur!
Upstairs, monsieur! Come!
Monsieur Firmin, come!
Open the doors, monsieur!
Monsieur Vicomte, come with me!
I know where they are!
- Can I trust you?
- You must.
But remember, keep your hand
at the level of your eyes.
- But why?
- The Punjab lasso, monsieur.
First Buquet, now Piangi.
Like this, monsieur. Look, I'II go with you.
No, Meg! No: You stay here.
Come with me, monsieur, do as I say.
But hurry, or we shall be too late.
Down once more
To the dungeon of my black despair
Down we plunge to the prison of my mind
Down that path into darkness
Deep as hell!
Why, you ask, was I bound and chained
In this cold and dismal place?
Not for any mortal sin
But the wickedness of my abhorrent face!
CHORUS:  Track down this murderer
He must be found
Hounded out by everyone
Met with hatred everywhere
No kind word from anyone
No compassion anywhere
Christine:
Christine, why? Why?
Your hand at the level of your eyes
At the level of your eyes
CHORUS:  At the level of your eyes
Level of your eyes
He lives across the lake, monsieur.
This is as far as I dare go.
Madame Giry,
thank you.
CHORUS:  Track down this murderer
He must be found
Track down this murderer
He must be found
Hunt down this animal who runs to ground
Too long he's preyed on us
But now we know
The Phantom of the Opera is here
Deep down below
He's here, The Phantom of the Opera
Have you gorged yourself at last
in your lust for blood?
Am I now to be prey to your lust for flesh?
That fate which condemns me
to wallow in blood
Has also denied me the joys of the flesh
This face
The infection which poisons our love
This face
Which earned a mother's fear and loathing
A mask, my first
Unfeeling scrap of clothing
Pity comes too late
Turn around and face your fate
An eternity of this
Before your eyes
This haunted face
Holds no horror for me now
It's in your soul
That the true distortion lies
Wait: I think, my dear, we have a guest.
- CHRISTINE: Raoul!
- Sir, this is indeed an unparalleled delight.
I had rather hoped that you would come
No!
And now, my wish comes true
You have truly made my night
-  Free her!
-
Do what you will, only free her!
Have you no pity?
Your lover makes a passionate plea
Please, Raoul, it's useless!
I love her
Does that mean nothing?
I love her
Show some compassion!
The world showed no compassion to me!
Christine, Christine
Let me see her!
Be my guest,
sir.
Christine.
Monsieur, I bid you welcome
Did you think that I would harm her?
Why should I make her pay
For the sins which are yours?
- No!
-
Order your fine horses now
Raise up your hand to the level of your eyes
Nothing can save you now
Except perhaps Christine
Start a new life with me
Buy his freedom with your love
Refuse me and you send
your lover to his death
This is the choice
This is the point of no return!
The tears I might have shed
For your dark fate
Grow cold
And turn to tears of hate
Christine, forgive me
Please, forgive me
I did it all for you and all for nothing
Farewell my fallen idol and false friend
-  Too late for turning back
-  We had such hopes
-  Too late for prayers and useless pity
-  And now such hopes are shattered
-  Say you love him and my life is over
-  Past all hopes of cries for help
No point in fighting
-  Either way you choose he has to win
-  Either way you choose you cannot win
So, do you end your days with me
Or do you send him to his grave?
Why make her lie to you to save me?
-  Past the point of no return
-  Angel of Music
-  Who deserves this?
-  The final threshold
RAOUL:  For pity's sake, Christine, say no!
His life is now the prize
which you must earn
Why do you curse mercy?
I fought so hard to free you
-  You've past the point of no return
-  Angel of Music
You deceived me
I gave my mind blindly
Blindly.
You try my patience.
Make your choice.
Pitiful creature of darkness
What kind of life have you known?
God give me courage to show you
You are not alone
CHORUS:  Track down this murderer
He must be found
Take her, forget me, forget all of this!
CHORUS:  Who is this monster?
Leave me alone! Forget all you've seen.
Go now, don't let them find you!
CHORUS:  Revenge for Piangi
Revenge for Buquet
Take the boat.
Swear to me never to tell
of the secret you know...
CHORUS:  This creature must never go free
The Phantom of the Opera
...of this Angel of Hell!
Go!
Go now, and leave me!
Masquerade
Paper faces on parade
Masquerade
Hide your face
So the world
Will never find you
Christine
I love
You
Say you'll share with me
One love, one lifetime
Say the word
And I will follow you
Share each day with me
Each night, each morning
You alone can make
My song take flight
It's over now
The music
Of the night
ANDREW LLOYD WEBBER: Thank you.
Oh, thank you. Thank you.
Gosh, uh, do sit down, for goodness' sake.
I might talk for too long.
Gosh, when I was a little boy
and I was first brought here by my mother
when I was five, I think,
to a Promenade concert,
I think I heard Beethoven's Third Symphony,
and I don't think I could have ever,
ever believed,
sitting somewhere up there,
that anything like this
would ever happen to my music.
And I have to thank, immediately,
Cameron Mackintosh.
What an extraordinary production
he's put together.
Thank you, Cameron.
We'll meet him in a moment.
But before I go any further,
the wonderful thing about musicals is that
something has to happen
that brings them all together.
I mean, you can have a really great musical
and one aspect of it could be wrong,
whether it be the production,
whether it be something to do with
how it's staged or anything,
and it might get buried
and then take years to find again.
But what happened so extraordinarily
with this is that everything came together
with Cameron as the producer.
Before we go any further, I have to say that
it would have never happened
without Maria Björnson, and of course...
Maria Björnson
was, as all of you know,
the incredible designer of the show:
It was her vision combined, I think,
with everything else
that really brought us along.
She tragically died some years ago.
One of the greatest sadnesses
is that she's not here tonight,
but I hope we've honoured her spirit
in every way.
So. Maria, thank you.
And I ought to say,
tonight's rather extraordinary
because I know that there are
many companies of The Phantom of the Opera
watching this performance around the world
because it's being beamed
around the world tonight.
And none, I suppose, more important
than the director who made it possible,
who's in New York at the moment
with the New York Broadway company,
Hal Prince So, hello, Hal!
And thank you for everything, Hal.
So without any more ado, let's bring on
the original creative team from London.
Here they come,
led by Sir Cameron Mackintosh.
Charles Hart, our lyricist, of course.
Andy Bridge, our lighting, and above all
Gillian Lynne, who staged tonight.
Thank you, Gillian.
And the creative team
from the Albert Hall tonight.
Here they all are.
Laurence, the director, in the middle.
Now...
Next, I have to thank our fantastic company.
What a fantastic show.
Ramin, Sierra, you couldn't have
done me more proud.
And Anthony Inglis
and the fantastic orchestra.
Just before we move on,
I'm going to introduce you in a second
to the original London company,
but I just would like you
to remember John Aron,
Steve Barton, who of course played Raoul,
and Mary Millar,
who sadly are no longer with us, but they
were wonderful members of our original team.
So, a small appreciation to them, please.
And here is our original London company.
We have one other member
of the company tonight
who has hotfooted it
from the London Palladium,
Michael Crawford.
Finally.
And I suppose this is very special for me.
It is a great joy for me to welcome tonight
my Angel of Music, Sarah Brightman.
But...
Without these two, we would not be here.
Uh, we have one slight additional surprise.
Sarah has agreed to sing.
So, I'm going to leave you
in the hands of the Angel of Music.
Maestro, take it away.
In sleep he sang to me
In dreams he came
That voice which calls to me
And speaks my name
And do I dream again
For now I find
The Phantom of the Opera is there
Inside my mind
Sing once again with me
Our strange duet
My power over you
Grows stronger yet
And though you turn from me
To glance behind
The Phantom of the Opera is there
Inside your mind
Those who have seen your face
Draw back in fear
I am the mask you wear
MEN:  It's me they hear
-  My spirit and your voice
-  Your spirit and my voice
ALL:  In one combined
The Phantom of the Opera is there
MEN:  Inside your mind
BRIGHTMAN:  Inside my mind
CHORUS:  He's there
The Phantom of the Opera
Beware, The Phantom of the Opera
BOTH:  In all your fantasies
You always knew
That man and mystery
Were both in you
ALL:  And in this labyrinth
Where night is blind
The Phantom of the Opera is there
Inside your mind
Sing! Sing, my Angel of Music!
He's there
The Phantom of the Opera
Sing for me!
Sing for me!
MEN: Sing for me!
ALL:  We have brought you
To the seat of sweet music's throne
To this kingdom
where all must pay homage to music
Music
We have come here
For one purpose and one alone
Since the moment you first heard us sing
We have needed you with us to serve him
To sing for his music
His music
Night-time sharpens
Heightens each sensation
Darkness stirs
And wakes imagination
Silently the senses
Abandon their defenses
Slowly, gently
Night unfurls its splendour
Grasp it, sense it
Tremulous and tender
Turn your face away
From the garish light of day
Turn your thoughts away
From cold, unfeeling light
And listen to the music of the night
Close your eyes and surrender
To your darkest dreams
Purge your thoughts of the life
You knew before
Close your eyes, let your spirit
Start to soar
And you'll live
As you've never lived before
ALL:  Softly, deftly
Music shall caress you
Hear it, feel it
Secretly possess you
Open up your mind
Let your fantasies unwind
In this darkness that
you know you cannot fight
The darkness of the music
Of the night
Let you mind start a journey
To a strange new world
Leave all thoughts
of the world you knew before
BOTH:  Let you soul take you where
You long to be
Only then
Can you belong
To me
Floating, falling
Sweet intoxication
Touch me, trust me
Savour each sensation
BOTH:  Let the dream begin
MEN:  Let your darker side give in
To the power of the music
That I write
The power of the music
Of the night
You alone can make
Our song take flight
ALL:  It's over now
The music of
The night
