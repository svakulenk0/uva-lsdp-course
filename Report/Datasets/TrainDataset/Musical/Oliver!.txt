Is it worth the waiting for
If we live till 84?
All we ever get is gruel
Every day we say our prayer
Will they change
the bill of fare?
Still we get
the same old gruel!
There's not a crust
Not a crumb can we find
Can we beg,
can we borrow or cadge?
But there's nothing
to stop us from
getting a thrill
When we all close
our eyes and imagine
Food, glorious food!
Hot sausage and mustard!
While we're in the mood
Cold jelly and custard!
Peas, pudding and saveloys!
What next is the question
Rich gentlemen have it, boys
Indigestion!
Food!
We're anxious to try it
Three banquets a day
Our favorite diet!
Just picture
a great big steak
Fried, roasted or stewed
Oh, food!
Wonderful food!
Marvelous food!
Glorious food!
Food, glorious food!
Don't care
what it looks like
Burned, underdone, crude
Don't care what
the cook's like
Just thinking
of growing fat
Our senses go reeling
One moment of knowing that
Full-up feeling
Food, glorious food!
What wouldn't we give for
That extra bit more
That's all that we live for
Why should we be fated to
Do nothing but brood
Oh, food
Magical food
Wonderful food
Marvelous food
Heavenly food
Beautiful food
Glorious food!
For what you are
about to receive
May the Lord make
you truly thankful
Amen
Please, sir,
I want some more.
What?
Please, sir,
I want some more?
More?
Catch him!
Snatch him!
Hold him!
Scold him!
Pounce him!
Trounce him!
Pick him up
and bounce him!
Wait!
Before we take
the lad to task
May I be so curious
as to ask his name?
Oliver
Oliver Twist, Mr. Bumble.
You named him
so yourself.
So that's who he is!
Oliver! Oliver!
Never before has
a boy wanted more!
Oliver! Oliver!
Won't ask for more
when he knows
what's in store
There's a dark,
thin, winding
Stairway without
any banister
Which we'll throw him down
And feed him on cockroaches
served in a canister
-  Oliver!
-  Oliver!
What will he do
when he's turned
black and blue?
He will rue the day
Somebody named him Oliver!
Oliver, Oliver
Never before has
a boy wanted more!
Oliver! Oliver!
Won't ask for more
when he knows
what's in store
There's a long,
thin, winding
Stairway without
any banister
Which we'll throw
him down
And feed him on cockroaches
served in a canister
Oliver! Oliver!
What, heavens pray,
will the governors say?
They will lay the blame
on the one who named him
Oliver!
- Out!
- Out!
One boy
Boy for sale
He's going cheap
How much, then?
Only seven guineas
How much?
That or thereabout
Fine boy
Boy for sale
He's yours to keep
For 1,000 pennies
You can work it out
That's four pounds,
three and four
Slightly under four guineas
Knocked down
from seven guineas
Three pounds,
ten shillings.
Three pounds
what, sir?
Certainly not, sir
Any advance on
three pounds ten, then?
Going
Gone
I could not say
He isn't very greedy
I dare not
I'd be telling you a tale
One boy
Boy for sale
Come take a peek
Have you ever seen
as nice a boy
For sale?
How much did you say?
Only three guineas,
Mr. Sowerberry.
A bargain,
if ever there was one.
I was looking
for a boy.
All right, bring him in,
Mr. Bumble.
Bring him in.
Ah, my love.
I said we might
consider taking this boy
to help in the shop.
Dear me.
He's very small.
Oh, he is rather small,
there's no denying,
but he'll grow,
Mrs. Sowerberry.
He'll grow.
I daresay he will.
On our vittles
and our drink!
These workhouse boys
always cost more
than they're worth.
Where did he come from?
Mother came to us destitute.
She brings a child
into the world,
takes one look at him
and promptly dies
without leaving so much
as a forwarding
name and address.
So here he is,
yours for three guineas,
as agreed. Cash on delivery.
Oh, no.
No, Mr. Bumble, no, no.
Cash upon liking.
A week on approval.
If we get enough
work out of him
without putting too
much food into him,
then we'll keep him.
But he's...
He can help Noah Claypole
put the shutters up.
Do you hear, now?
Then he can clean
out the stables,
fill the lamps
and sweep the yard.
I'll look after him, missus.
You see, my dear,
it occurred to me
that he'd make
a delightful
coffin-follower.
That, uh...
That expression
of melancholy.
It's very interesting,
don't you think so, my love?
MRS. SOWERBERRY: Hmm.
I don't mean
a regular coffin-follower
to attend grown-up people,
no, no, no,
just at children's
funerals.
A mute in proportion,
so to speak?
Precisely. A superb effect,
don't you think so, my love?
Mmm. Do you think you could look
like that gentleman up there?
Perhaps,
if I had a tall hat.
Look, it's Oliver!
Noah, come on.
No.
How's your mother,
workhouse?
You leave my mother
out of it. She's dead.
What did she die of?
Shortage of breath?
You'd better
not say anything
about her to me.
Don't you be cheeky,
workhouse.
Your mother,
she was a nice one.
A regular right-down
bad one, she was.
What did you say?
It's a good thing
she died when she did,
'cause she'd been in prison
doing hard labor...
Help! Help!
Get away, you!
Get away from him!
MRS. SOWERBERRY:
What's going on down here?
What are you trying to do,
wake up the dead
or something?
It's you, you little...
Get out of here!
He started it!
Come here, you!
Quick!
Put the lid on.
Oh, dear!
I'm going off. Water!
Noah, run over
to the workhouse.
Get Mr. Bumble.
Tell him to come quick.
Well, where is he?
Where is the young rascal?
- Oliver?
- OLIVER:  Yes, I'm here!
Do you know this
here voice, Oliver?
Yes, I do!
Well, ain't you
afraid of it, Oliver?
Ain't you a-trembling
when I speak, Oliver?
No, I'm not!
He's gone mad, Mr. Bumble.
Or he wouldn't
dare to speak
to you like that.
It's not madness,
ma'am, it's meat.
Meat?
Meat, ma'am, meat!
You overfed the boy, ma'am.
You've raised an artificial
spirit in the lad
unbecoming to his
station in life.
This would never have happened
if you kept him on gruel.
MRS. SOWERBERRY: Gruel?
I'll be glad to
give you the recipe.
Well, well, well.
Having a rest,
Mr. Bumble?
He's sitting on Oliver.
Quite right.
We must all
sit on Oliver.
You been drinking again?
I met a friend
in the cemetery.
OLIVER: Help!
Who's in there?
That coffin should
not have been occupied
until tomorrow.
It's reserved for
a very important client.
Stand back!
Now, then.
What's your explanation,
you young scallywag?
He called my mum a name.
And what if he did,
you ungrateful
little wretch?
She deserved what
he said and worse.
She didn't!
She did!
It's a lie!
Hold your tongue, boy!
Put him down in the cellar,
Mr. Bumble. That'll teach him.
My love?
Yes!
It's really
quite comfortable.
You'll stay down there
till we decide what's
to be done with you.
And here's your baggage,
workhouse.
MRS. SOWERBERRY:
Three pounds, indeed!
You can take him back.
Where is love?
Does it fall
from skies above?
Is it underneath
the willow tree
That I've been
dreaming of?
Where is she
Who I close
my eyes to see?
Will I ever know
the sweet hello
That's meant for only me?
Who can say
where she may hide?
Must I travel
far and wide?
Till I am beside
the someone who
I can mean something to
Where
Is love?
Every night
I kneel and pray
Let tomorrow be the day
When I see the face
of someone who
I can mean something to
Where
Is love?
Please help me. Please!
What you staring at?
Haven't you
never seen a toff?
No, never. I'm sorry.
I didn't...
Oh, that's all right.
Hungry?
Yes, I am.
I've come a long way.
I've been walking
for seven days.
Been running away from
the beak, have you?
The what?
Now, don't say you don't
know what a beak is.
It's a bird's mouth,
isn't it?
My eyes,
how green can you get!
For your information,
a beak is a magistrate.
Who you running
away from, then?
Your old man?
No, I'm an orphan.
I've come to London
to make my fortune.
Oh.
You have, have you?
Got any lodgings?
Money?
Not a farthing.
Do you live
in London?
What the...
I suppose you want someplace
to sleep tonight, eh?
Do you know
of anywhere?
Uh...
As it so happens,
I know a respectable
old gentleman
what'll give you
lodgings for nothing.
Really?
And never ask
for the change.
That is, if any other
gentleman he knows
introduces you.
And don't he know me?
He must be a very
kind old gentleman.
Oh. Oh, yes, yes,
he's very kind.
And I'm a particular
favorite of his.
Well, now,
if you're coming along,
I'd better know who you are.
My name's Oliver.
Oliver Twist.
And mine's Jack Dawkins.
Better known among me more
intimate friends as
the Artful Dodger.
Pleased to meet you,
Mr. Dodger.
Sure the old gentleman
won't mind?
Mind?
Consider yourself at home
Consider yourself
one of the family
I've taken to you so strong
It's clear we're
going to get along
Consider yourself well in
Consider yourself

Here!
There isn't a lot to spare
Who cares?
Whatever we got we share!
If it should

Empty-larder days
Why grouse?
Always a chance we'll meet
Somebody to foot the bill
Then the drinks

Consider yourself our mate
We don't want

For after some consideration
we can state
Consider yourself

WOMEN:  La-la-la-la-la

There's a cup o' tea for all
Only it's wise to be handy
with a rolling pin
When the landlord
comes to call!

There you go, boys.
Hammer up, hammer down!
Lift, down!
Up! Out! Down! Lift! Drop!

Lift, down! Up!
ALL: Help!

It's Dodger! Coming up.
Dodger.
Oliver!
Up you go.
Oh, not again!
Get out!
Hey, Fagin,
I brought a new
friend to see you.
Oliver Twist.
Sir.
I hope I shall
have the honor
of your intimate
acquaintance.
We are very glad to
see you, Oliver. Very.
Aren't we, my dears?
Oh, yeah, Fagin!
Yes, Fagin!
Give me back my things!
Leave it! Leave it!
Leave him alone!
Dodger,
take off the sausages.
Charlie, lay a place at
the table for Mr. Twist.
The Dodger tells me you
have come to London
to seek your fortune, Oliver.
Yes, sir.
Well, we must see
what we can do to
help you, mustn't we?
Ooh. Thank you, sir.
These sausages
are moldy!
Shut up and drink your gin!
You're staring at the
pocket handkerchiefs,
eh, my dear?
We just hung them up
ready for the wash,
that's all.
Is this a laundry,
then, sir?
Yeah, that's right.
A laundry!
Not exactly, my boy.
I suppose a laundry
would be a very
nice thing indeed.
But our line
of business pays
a little better.
Don't it, boys?
You see, Oliver...
In this life,
one thing counts
In the bank, large amounts!
I'm afraid these
don't grow on trees
You've got to pick
a pocket or two
You've got to pick
a pocket or two, boys
You've got to pick
a pocket or two
Large amounts
don't grow on trees
You've got to pick
a pocket or two
Let's show Oliver how
to do it, my dears!
Just a game, Oliver,
just a game.
Why should we
break our backs
Stupidly paying tax?
Better get some
untaxed income
Better pick a pocket or two
You've got to pick
a pocket or two, boys
You've got to pick
a pocket or two
Why should we all
break our backs?
Better pick
a pocket or two
Robin Hood, what a crook
Gave away what he took
Charity's fine
Subscribe to mine
Get out and pick
a pocket or two
You've got to pick
a pocket or two, boys
ALL:  Robin Hood
was far too good
He had to pick
a pocket or two
Take a tip from Bill Sikes
He can whip what he likes
I recall, he started small
He had to pick a pocket or two
You've got to pick
a pocket or two, boys
You've got to pick
a pocket or two
We could be
like old Bill Sikes
If we pick a pocket or two
Dear old gent passing by
Something nice takes his eye
Everything's clear
Attack the rear!
Get in and pick
a pocket or two
You've got to pick
a pocket or two, boys
You've got to pick
a pocket or two
ALL:  Have no fear
Attack the rear
Get in and pick
a pocket or two
When I see someone rich
Both my thumbs start to itch
Only to find
some peace of mind
I have to pick
a pocket or two
You've got to pick
a pocket or two, boys
You've got to pick
a pocket or two
Just to find
some peace of mind
We have to pick
a pocket or two!
Put them all
back in the box!
Oh, why must we?
Why?
All of them.
Come here!
Good boy. What a crook!
We've all been
hard at work today,
haven't we, my dears?
And what have
you got, Dodger?
A couple of wallets.
Lined?
Only the best.
Not as heavy as
they might be.
But very nicely made.
Ingenious workman,
ain't he, Oliver?
Does he make
these himself?
With his own
lily-white hands!
What have you
got, Charlie?
A couple of wipes.
Well, they're very
good ones. Very.
But you haven't embroidered them
too well, though,
have you, Charlie?
So we'll have to
pick the initials
out with a needle.
You'll need to learn
how to do this, too,
Oliver, my dear.
Won't he, boys?
Yeah, the trademark.
BOY: The trademark.
In the meantime,
you must learn
how to make wallets.
Like the Dodger.
You'd like that,
wouldn't you, my dear?
Yes, Mr. Fagin,
if you'll teach me.
Certainly, my boy,
no fee.
Just do everything
that Dodger and
the others do.
Make them your
models, my dear,
especially Dodger.
He's going to be
a right little Bill Sikes.
Who's Bill Sikes, Mr. Fagin?
Ah. He's a very clever
gentleman.
You'll meet him tomorrow.
Maybe. Now is it
possible, perchance,
that my kerchief
is protruding
from my pocket?
Yes. I can just
see the edge.
Can you?
Well, then.
See if you can take it out
without my feeling it,
like you saw the others do.
Rum-pum-pum
Rum-pum-pum
Skiddle-ay-ty
Tiddle-iddle-ay-ty
Ti-rum-a-tum
a-rum-tum-tum
You've got to pick
a pocket or two, boys
You've got to pick
a pocket or two
Is it gone?
Yes, Mr. Fagin. Look!
Well, that's a surprise, I must say.
You're a clever boy,
Oliver.
I never saw a sharper lad.
Here's a shilling
for you.
I have to go to the bank.
Now, bedtime, all of you!
There's a hard
day's work ahead!
Close the shutters!
Where do I sleep, sir?
Hmm?
Over here, my dear.
Settle down!
Dodger, take your
hat off in bed!
Where's your manners?
Here, my dear,
have a good sleep.
There, that's it.
Put you up right. There.
If you go on
the way you started,
you will be the greatest
man of all time.
Sweet dreams, Oliver.
Sweet dreams.
Good night, sir.
You've got to pick
a pocket or two, boys
You've got to pick
a pocket or two
Is he here?
Mr. Sikes.
Has he come yet?
Nancy's inside
waiting for him.
And how's business?
Nice and brisk? Hmm?
Don't burn your fingers,
will you?
I never do, my dear.
Not if I can help it.
Nancy!
Nancy! He's back! He's here!
Nancy.
Beautiful.
You done well, Bill.
All one job?
Such a professional.
Now, Bill...
Bill. Carry cash?
At this time of night?
All those thieves and robbers
lurking in dark alleyways?
I wouldn't dare.
Besides, I've got
to price it first.
Nancy's waiting.
Give you a good supper.
Tomorrow, Bill.
My word on it.
Small pleasures,
small pleasures
Who would deny us these?
Gin toddies, large measures
No skimping, if you please!
I rough it, I love it
Life is a game of chance
I never tire of it
Leading a merry dance
If you don't mind
having to go without things
It's a fine life!
Though it ain't all
jolly old pleasure outings
It's a fine life!
When you've got
someone to love
You forget your
care and strife
Let the prudes
look down on us
Let the wide world
frown on us
It's a fine, fine life!
Who cares if strait-laces
Sneer at us in the street?
Fine airs and fine graces
Don't have to sin to eat
We wander through London
Who knows what we may find?
There's pockets left undone
On many a behind
If you don't mind taking it
like it turns out
It's a fine life!
Keep the candle burning
until it burns out
It's a fine life!
Though you
sometimes do come by
The occasional black eye
You can always cover one
Till he blacks the other one
But you don't dare cry
No flounces, no feathers
No frills and furbelows
All winds and all weather
Ain't good for fancy clothes
These trappings
These tatters
These we can just afford
What future? What matters?
We've got our bed and board
If you don't mind
having to deal with Fagin
It's a fine life!
Though diseased rats
threaten to bring
the plague in
It's a fine life!
And the grass
is green and dense
On the right side
of the fence
So we take good care of it
That we get our share of it
And we don't mean pence
If you don't mind
having to like or lump it
It's a fine life!
It's a fine...
Though there's
no tea-sipping
and eating crumpets
It's a fine life!
Not for me, the happy home
Happy husband, happy wife
Though it
sometimes touches me
For the likes of such as me
Mine's a fine, fine life!
Bull's-eye! Come here,
will you? Bull's-eye!
Bull's-eye! Come here!
Worth all the rest
put together.
Can I help it?
This is my private treasure.
My little pleasure.
A cup of coffee
and a quick count-up.
I mean, who's gonna look
after me in me old age?
Would you, birdie?
Will you?
Why are you watching me?
Why are you, mate?
Quick! Speak out!
I want to know
every detail you saw!
I'm sorry, sir.
I'm sorry.
Did you see where
I fetched the box from?
I don't think so, sir.
Be sure. Be sure!
Quite sure, sir!
Well,
if you're sure,
then I'm sure.
Of course,
I knew all along, my dear.
I didn't mean
to frighten you.
Brave boy, Oliver.
Brave boy.
Did you...
Did you see any of
those pretty things,
my dear?
Yes, sir.
They're mine, Oliver.
My little treasure.
All I got to live on
in me old age.
It's a terrible thing,
old age.
Yes, sir.
I'm sorry, sir.
Can I go back to sleep
again now, sir?
Certainly, my boy,
go to sleep.
Pleasant dreams.
Same to you, sir.
Sauce boat, George III,
scroll handle, £5.
Tiara, George II,
rose-cut diamond,
paste, half a crown.
Nancy!
I'm coming!
Bill?
Bill, your breakfast
is ready.
Oh, for God's sake.
Oh, I'll warm it up
for your supper.
Go down to Fagin's
and get the cash,
will you?
All right.
Nancy.
I am trying to sleep.
Bill.
You do love me, don't you?
Of course I do!
I live with you, don't I?
That bit's for me,
ain't it, Fagin?
Eat, eat, eat, eat, eat!
Appetite!
Come on,
finish your breakfast,
it's time to get to work.
Hurry up, you'll miss
the morning trade.
Ain't there no more
sausages, then?
You want some supper
tonight? Hmm?
Hi, hi.
Who wants some bull's-eyes?
Oh, Wait a minute, now!
One at a time!
One at a time!
Oh, go on, then.
Go and share them.
Miladies, they must
meet our new boy.
Well!
What have we
got here, then?
Oh, ladies, I forgot you
must meet our new lodger,
Mr. Oliver Twist, Esquire.
Nancy and Beth.
Charmed.
Oh, yes. We're all
ladies and gentlemen around
here. We're all quality.
Now, don't you take
no notice of him, Oliver.
Just 'cause you got
manners and they ain't.
What you mean,
I ain't got no manners?
I'm a regular gent, I am!
Yeah!
DODGER: Permit me to assist
you across the road?
Well, I was only going
to the palace, actually.
Doorman, a cab,
if you please.
Allow me the privilege
to escort you in me
own carriage.
Oh!
After you, Your Grace.
Sir Artful,
you are too kind.
I'd do anything
For you, dear, anything
For you mean
everything to me
I know that
I'd go anywhere
For your smile,
anywhere
For your smile
everywhere I'd see
Would you climb
a hill?
Anything!
Wear a daffodil?
Anything!
Leave me all your will?
Anything!
Even fight my Bill?
What? Fisticuffs?
I'd risk everything
For one kiss, everything
Yes, I'd do anything!
Anything?
Anything for you!
I'd do anything
For you, dear, anything
For you mean
everything to me
I know that
I'd go anywhere
For your smile, anywhere
For your smile
everywhere I'd see
Would you lace
my shoe?
Anything!
Paint your face
bright blue?
Anything!
Catch a kangaroo?
Anything!
Go to Timbuktu?
And back again
I'd risk everything
For one kiss, everything
Yes, I'd do anything
Anything?
Anything for you!
I'd go anywhere
For your smile, anywhere
For your smile
everywhere I'd see
I know that
I'd do anything
For you, dear, anything
For you mean
everything to me
To me!
To me!
To me!
To me, me, me, me, me!
I'd do anything
For you, dear, anything
Yes, I'd do anything
Anything?
Anything for you!
Would you rob a shop?
Anything!
Would you risk the drop?
Anything
Though your eyes go pop?
Anything!
When you come down, plop!
Hang everything!
We'd risk life and limb
To keep you in the swim
Yes, we'd do anything!
Anything?
Anything for you
Well, get to work, then!
No argument when
there's fine pickings
in the street.
Get out and earn your keep.
You promised we could
go see the hanging!
Be sure it ain't
your own.
Fagin, I'm waiting.
Waiting, my dear? What for?
Bill will give you what-for
if you don't fork out.
Now come on, hand over.
Start counting.
Come on,
what do you think we are?
Rush, rush, rush.
You and your Bill,
you'll be the ruin
of me between you!
That's right.
If it's all the same to you!
What was that for?
For getting caught!
I was only practicing!
I'll die a pauper yet.
Here, take it.
I'll starve. You'll find me
lying in the gutter
with me feet
sticking up in the air.
Bill might think the
count is a bit short,
wouldn't you say?
I only wish you had to
get rid of the stuff.
That's all I wish.
He still might. Come on.
So me and the boys,
we live on air till
I find a customer?
Heartless,
that's what I am.
Come on, Beth.
Ta-ta, kids!
BOYS: Ta-ta, Nancy!
Bye, Nancy!
Hey, Fagin.
Young Oliver wants
to come on the game
with Charlie and me.
...six and four is ten,
another 13, and 3 1.
Hmm?
What's that?
On the job, you mean?
Can I? Please?
I'd like to.
Would you, my dear?
Well, why not?
You got to start somewhere.
You couldn't do it
in better company.
Look after him, Dodger.
Hats on, boys.
Time we're off.
Then I can go, sir?
Good luck on your
firstjob, my dear.
I'll be waiting for you
here when you come back.
- Line up!
- Line up!
Single file!
Single file!
Quick march, left!
Right!
Left!
Right!
Aye, aye!
You can go,
but be back soon
You can go,
but while you're working
This place I'm pacing 'round
Until you're home,
safe and sound
Fare thee well,
but be back soon
Who can tell where
danger's lurking?
Do not forget this tune
Be back soon
How could we forget?
How could we let
Our dear old Fagin worry?
We love him so
We'll come back home
In, oh,
such a great big hurry
It's him that pays the piper
It's us that calls the tune
So long, fare thee well
Pip-pip, cheerio
We'll be back soon
Cheerio, but be back soon
I don't know,
somehow I miss you
I love you
That's why I
Say cheerio, not good-bye
Don't be gone long
Be back soon
Give me one long, last look
Bless you
Remember our old tune
Be back soon
You can go,
but be back soon
You can go,
but bring back plenty
Of wallets full of cash
Don't want to see any trash
Whip 'em quick
and be back soon
Only thick ones now,
not empty
Get rich this afternoon
Be back soon
Our pockets hold
a watch of gold
That chimes upon the hour
A wallet fat
An old man's hat
The jewels from the Tower
We know the nosy policemen
But they don't know this tune
So long, fare thee well
Pip-pip, cheerio
We'll be back soon
Cheerio, but be back soon
I don't know,
somehow I miss you
I love you
That's why I
Say cheerio, not good-bye
Don't be gone long,
be back soon
Give me one long last look
Bless you
Remember our old tune
Be back soon
And when we're
in the distance
You'll hear
this whispered tune
So long, fare thee well
Pip-pip, cheerio
We'll be back soon
So long, fare thee well
Pip-pip, cheerio
We'll be back soon
So long, fare thee well
Pip-pip, cheerio
We'll be back soon
Cheerio, but be back soon
I don't know,
somehow I miss you
I love you
That's why I
Say cheerio, not good-bye
And when we're
in the distance
You'll hear
this whispered tune
So long, fare thee well
Pip-pip, cheerio
We'll be back soon
Dodger! Oliver!
Come on!
Now, now, now!
Go on, get going!
Come here, boy.
Now,
give that back, you hear?
Give that back.
Come along, boy.
Come along...
Stop that boy!
Thief! My wallet!
Stop that boy!
Hold that boy! Stop!
Stop him! Stop him!
Stop! Thief!
Leave him to us!
He stole the gent's wallet!
We'll catch him!
Would you...
He went that way!
Have you seen him?
No. He's disappeared.
He's gone.
Come here.
Come here, you...
Here!
Watch it!
Watch where you're going!
WOMAN:
Do something someone. Bring him down.
Boy!
There's the gent
he stole from.
Can you identify this
boy as the thief, sir?
Yes! Well, I saw him
running away.
Why didn't you
look after him?
Why didn't you bring
him back with you?
How can I help it?
A fine thing,
Oliver in the lockup.
And in the morning
he's up in front of the beak!
For pinching a wallet.
So he goes to jail.
What's it matter?
I'm afraid he may
say something
which will get
us into trouble.
That's very likely,
Fagin.
You see,
you're blowed upon.
And I'm afraid, you see,
that if the game
was up with us,
it might be up
with a good many more.
And it would come out
rather worse for you
than it would for me.
Why, you miserable,
sneaking, treacherous old...
No, Bill!
You go down to that
court in the morning
and you will find
out what happens.
Me? Go to court?
With a magistrate
sitting there?
I'll go.
They won't know me.
Good girl. Clever girl.
And if he does talk,
you'll come and tell us
quick, eh, Nancy? Quick!
'Cause then we'll have
to look after ourselves,
won't we?
You won't have to look
after yourself, Fagin.
'Cause I'll look
after you, believe me.
I always believe you, Bill.
Have another drink.
Silence. Silence in court.
Well? What crime is
this one charged with?
He looks a thoroughbred
old reprobate to me.
Speak up, man!
What's he charged with?
He's not charged at all,
Your Worship.
This gentlemen appears
against the boy.
Mmm? Boy?
What boy? I see no boy.
The boy in the dock,
Your Worship.
Mmm?
Oh, yes. Stand up, boy,
I can't see you!
He is standing up,
Your Worship.
Don't be impertinent!
Put him on a box
or something.
MAGISTRATE:
Well, what's he charged with?
CLERK: Picking pockets, sir.
What's your name, boy?
Oliver.
Hmm.
And does your father
know you're here?
Hmm?
I'm an orphan.
He says he's
an orphan, sir.
And where do you come from?
Where do you live?
Who looks after you?
He doesn't seem able
to say where he lives,
or anything else, sir.
Well.
A liar as well
as a thief, eh?
And insolent
into the bargain.
Well, that settles it.
The boy is committed
to three months
with hard labor.
This is disgraceful!
I demand to be heard.
- You have not yet...
- Sir, I was there!
What's this disturbance?
Remove this lunatic!
Clear the court!
I will speak!
I saw what happened.
It was outside my shop.
Two other boys stole
Mr. Brownlow's wallet.
This child had
nothing to do with it.
But sentence
has been passed!
Hasn't it?
He didn't talk.
Case was dismissed.
What a greatjudge!
Fetch the boy.
I've done my share.
Cor! Look!
Now, come on.
Where are we going?
At least I can
make some amends.
You're coming home with me.
Jump in.
Dodger! After them!
Let the kid go!
He can still blab
on us, can't he?
Leave him be!
Dodger! Don't lose him!
WOMAN:  Who will buy
my sweet red roses?
Two blooms for a penny
Who will buy
my sweet red roses?
Two blooms for a penny
Who will buy

Two blooms for a penny
Who will buy
my sweet red roses?

Ripe strawberries, ripe!
Any milk today, mistress?

Ripe strawberries, ripe!
Any milk today, mistress?
Knives, knives to grind!
Any knives to grind?
Ripe strawberries, ripe!
Who will buy?
Who will buy this
wonderful morning?
Such a sky,
you never did see
Who will buy
my sweet red roses?
Who will tie it up
with a ribbon
And put it in a box for me?
Ripe strawberries, ripe!
So I could see it
at my leisure
Whenever things go wrong
And I would keep it
as a treasure
To last my whole life long
Any milk today?
Who will buy this
wonderful feeling?
I'm so high
I swear I could fly
Knives to grind!
Ripe strawberries, ripe!
Me, oh, my
I don't want to lose it
So what am I to do
To keep the sky so blue?
There must be
someone who will buy
Toy windmills
Onions
Knives to grind
Who will buy?
Who will buy this
wonderful morning?
Such a sky
you never did see
Who will tie it
up with a ribbon
And put it in a box for me?
There'll never
be a day so sunny
It could not happen twice
Where is the man
with all the money?
It's cheap
at half the price!
Who will buy this

someone who will buy
There'll never
be a day so sunny
I know it could
not happen twice
Where is the man
with all the money?
It's cheap
at half the price!
At half the price
Who will buy this morning
of mornings?
Makes you feel
you're walking on air
Every tree and
flower is singing
How fortunate of me
to be alive to see
The dawning of a day so fair
Bye-bye, lullaby
Who will buy this
wonderful feeling?
I'm so high
I swear I could fly
What a sky, a heavenly ceiling,
inviting you to try and fly
There'll never
be a day so sunny
It could not happen twice
Where is the man
with all the money?
It's cheap
at half the price!

We've got to get him back,
do you hear?
Nab him the first
time he sets foot
out of the door.
He never goes out alone.
You know that.
Don't you back-answer me,
my girl.
Three days since
I spotted him.
And what you done
about it, eh?
Eh?
Nothing!
We've got to get
hold of him somehow.
Now, who's coming?
Suppose it'll
have to be me.
Shut your trap, Dodger.
You've caused
enough trouble already.
It's going to be
done quiet, no fuss.
Someone who has
the boy's confidence.
Nancy, my dear,
what do you say?
It's no good you
trying it on with me.
And just exactly
what do you mean
by that remark?
What I say!
I'm not going!
Why can't you
leave the boy alone?
He won't do you no harm!
Why can't you
leave him where he is,
where he'll have
the chance of
a decent life?
You'll bring him
back here, my girl,
unless you want
to feel my hand
on your throat.
Nancy, my dear,
we must have that
boy brought back.
If he talked, think
what would happen to us.
Think what would
happen to Bill.
It would be the gallows
for him, Nancy.
The drop!
You wouldn't want that to happen,
would you, my dear? Not to Bill.
She'll go, Fagin.
No, she won't, Fagin!
Yes, she will, Fagin!
She'll go.
Even if I have to
drag her there meself.
As long as he needs me
Oh, yes, he does need me
In spite of what you see
I'm sure that he needs me
Who else would
love him still
When they've
been used so ill
He knows I always will
As long as he needs me
I miss him so much
when he is gone
But when he's near me
I don't let on
The way I feel
Inside
The love I have to hide
The hell!
I've got my pride!
As long as he needs me
He doesn't say
the things he should
He acts the way
he thinks he should
But all the same
I'll play this game
His way
As long
As he needs me
I know where I must be
I'll cling on steadfastly
As long as he needs me
As long as life is long
I'll love him
right or wrong
And somehow I'll be strong
As long as he
Needs me
If you are lonely
Then you will know
When someone needs you
You'll love them so
I won't
Betray his trust
Though people say I must
I've got to stay true just
As long as he
Needs me
Can I answer it, Rose?
Thank you, dear.
Books from Mr. Jessop.
Thank you.
Please, sir,
these books came for you.
Oh, good.
Oh, wait,
there are some to go back.
Boy's gone, sir.
Can I take them for you?
I know where the shop is.
Please let me take them.
I'll be very quick.
All right. Mrs. Bedwin,
the books are on the
table beside my bed.
Now, then, Oliver.
You'll take those
books to Mr. Jessop
and tell him you
have come to pay
the £4.10 that I owe him.
This is a £5 note,
so it'll be 10
shillings change.
You under...
Understand?
She's a very pretty lady,
isn't she, sir?
Yes.
I'll take the books for you.
In a new suit of clothes,
with a set ofvaluable books
and a £5 note in his pocket,
and you expect
him to come back?
Don't you?
If he does,
I'll eat me head,
with me hat on it.
Look at that portrait.
Do you see
a likeness to the lad?
Well, that's your niece,
isn't it?
That's what I mean.
Wasn't she the girl who...
Who ran away.
A young, innocent face,
nothing more.
Mere coincidence.
I'm not so sure.
Born in a workhouse
at Dunstable, he thinks.
That's all he can tell us.
Very well.
Who will buy this
wonderful morning?
Morning.
Morning!
Such a sky
you never did see
Who will tie it
up with a ribbon
And put it in a box for me?
Help! Help!
Get in the cart.
Bull's-eye.
Here, boy, hurry up.
Bull's-eye?
Bull's-eye! Come here!
Oliver's back!
Look at his togs!
He's got books, too!
Quite the little gent,
ain't he?
Lovely bit of stuff.
Delighted to see
you're looking
so well, my dear.
The Dodger will
give you another suit,
for fear you should
spoil that Sunday one.
Cor! Look at this!
I'll bank it for you.
What's that?
That's mine, Fagin.
No, no, my dear.
Mine. Ours.
You shall have the books.
You hand it over,
you avaricious old skeleton.
That's for our share
of the trouble.
You keep the books.
Start a library.
Mr. Brownlow will be here after you
if he finds out you've got
his books and money.
So he'll be out here, will he?
Out here?
After us?
What did you
tell him about us?
Nothing!
Fagin, I'll wager
this young rat's
told him everything.
What did you tell him?
No! Leave him alone!
You stand off me!
No violence!
You'll have to kill me before I let you
lay a hand on that boy.
Don't you tell me.
Just don't you tell me.
You keep out of this!
If he says he
didn't tell them,
he didn't tell them.
Hit me, would you?
I won't stand by
and see it done, Bill.
Let him be!
Let him be, or I'll put my mark
on you, and I don't care
for no consequences
Nancy, you're
wonderful tonight!
Such talent! Such a joker!
You take care I don't
overdo it, Fagin,
or I'll put the finger
on all of you,
and I don't care
if I hang for it!
Do you know who you are?
And what you are?
You don't have to tell me.
A fine one for the boy
to make a friend of.
Yes, I am, God help me!
And I wish I'd been struck down dead
before I laid a hand
to bring him back here.
From tonight he's a liar
and a thief,
and all that's bad.
Ain't that enough for you
without beating him to death?
Come, come, Sikes.
We must have civil words.
Civil words.
Oh, yes, you deserve them
from me, don't you?
I thieved for you
when I was half his age.
And it's your dirty work
I've been doing ever since.
Well, if you have,
it's a living, isn't it?
He's right, Nancy.
A living is a living.
Some living! Lord help me!
Some living!
FAGIN: Get to bed, all of you.
Get to bed, I said!
All this violence,
all these scenes,
screams, dramas!
I'm asking you,
is it necessary?
Not yet, Fagin.
Not yet.
But if this godforsaken
little good-for-nothing's
uttered one word,
one word, mind you...
If he has, the little devil,
we sit down,
we talk it over,
we think it out,
we decide upon
a proper course of safe action,
we stay calm!
Do we?
And while we're sitting here
thinking, and talking,
and staying calm,
our collars get felt, don't they?
And it's,
"Come along with me,
if you please."
No, thank you very much.
Look, you thought us
into this little lot.
You can think
your way out of it.
But from now on,
Bill Sikes takes the law
into his own hands.
These hands.
Have you ever heard the sound
a chicken makes when they're
wringing off its neck?
Can't say I ever had the...
They squawks, Fagin.
They squawks.
Not a very pretty sound.
No, Bill.
And then they dies,
don't they?
Yes, Bill. I mean, no, Bill.
Then they say some
even start squawking
before that event.
They get what you might call
a premonition.
Now, then,
you wouldn't be
having no premonition
of that sort by any chance,
would you?
Not me, Bill.
The lips are sealed.
I'm glad.
'Cause if anyone here
should lead the law to me,
and I gets to hear of it,
then it will be your neck.
Your scraggy old neck.
You think about it, Fagin.
A violent man, Dodger.
A very violent man.
When that man's
back is up, Dodger,
no one is safe.
Look after him, Dodger.
And I'll look after meself.
A man's got a heart,
hasn't he?
Joking apart, hasn't he?
And though I'd be
the first one to say
that I wasn't a saint
I'm finding it hard
To be really as black
as they paint
I'm reviewing the situation
Can a fellow be
a villain all his life?
All the trials
and tribulation!
Better settle down
and get myself a wife
And the wife would
cook and sew for me
And come for me,
and go for me
And go for me and nag at me
The finger she would wag at me
The money she
would take from me
A misery she'd make from me
I think I'd better
think it out again
A wife you can keep anyway
I'd rather sleep anyway
Left without
anyone in the world
And I'm starting from now
So how to win friends
and to influence people?
So how?
I'm reviewing
the situation
I must quickly look
up everyone I know
Titled people
with a station
Who can help me make
a real impressive show!
I will own
a suite at Claridge's
And run a fleet of carriages
And wave at all
the duchesses
With friendliness,
as much as is
Befitting of my new estate
Good morrow to you,
Magistrate!
I think I'd better
think it out again
So where shall I go?
Somebody!
Who do I know? Nobody!
All my dearest companions
have always been
villains and thieves
So, at my time of life
I should start turning
over new leaves?
I'm reviewing
the situation
If you want to eat,
you've got to earn a bob
Is it such a humiliation
For a robber to perform
an honestjob?
So a job I'm getting, possibly
I wonder who my boss'll be?
I wonder
if he'll take to me?
What bonuses
he'll make to me?
I'll start at 8:00
and finish late
At normal rate
and all, but wait!
I think
I'd better think it out
I think I'd better
think it out again!
What happens when I'm 70?
Must come a time, 70
When you're old
and it's cold
And who cares if
you live or you die?
Your one consolation's
the money you may have put by
I'm reviewing the situation
I'm a bad 'un and
a bad 'un I shall stay!
You'll be seeing
no transformation
But it's wrong to be
a rogue in every way
I don't want
nobody hurt for me
Or made to do
the dirt for me
This rotten life
is not for me
It's getting
far too hot for me
There is no
in-between for me
But who will change
the scene for me?
Don't want no one
to rob for me
But who will find
a job for me?
I think I'd better
think it out again! Hey!
And so, sir,
the instant I received
your communication
regarding dear
little Oliver,
I decided we must take
the first coach to London.
I decided.
That's right, sir,
my dear wife decided.
It was good of you
to come.
Now, what have you
got to tell me?
This locket,
sir, once belonged
to the boy's mother.
Found by the wife
after she passed away.
The boy's mother,
that is, not my dear wife.
You've kept this
all these years?
Why should I not?
Did it not occur to you
that this might provide the answer
to the boy's parentage?
His identity? His very name?
But he had no name, sir.
The mother was unmarried.
It was your clear duty
to show this evidence
to some higher authority.
Your behavior, madam,
was shameful!
How dare you speak to me so?
I only came here to help you.
You came here to profit
from your own greed
and dishonesty.
Sir, if you think
the locket don't properly
belong to my dear wife...
Be quiet,
you old fool!
Here. Your reward.
And something for the locket.
Take it.
Think yourselves lucky
you're not in the hands
of the law.
Mrs. Bedwin,
show these people out.
There's gratitude for you!
I hope this unfortunate
little circumstance
won't deprive me of
my parochial office?
My hope, sir,
is that it will.
But it was all
Mrs. Bumble, sir.
I knew nothing of
it until yesterday.
That's no excuse.
In the eyes of the law,
you are the more
guilty of the two.
For the law supposes
that your wife acts
under your direction.
If that's what
the law supposes, sir,
then the law's an ass!
If that's the eye
of the law, sir,
then law is a bachelor!
And the worst I wish
the law is that its eye
may be opened by experience!
By experience, sir!
Sir, the locket,
I didn't really see...
I recognized it at once.
I gave it to my niece, Emily,
on her 18th birthday.
So it wasn'tjust her
young man jilting her
that made her run away?
No.
She must have made her
way to that workhouse
and had her baby there.
What's going on?
Why have you
brought the boy here?
'Cause he's coming on a job
with me.
But why him?
'Cause I need
a little one.
That's why.
And he's nice and thin.
And on this particularjob,
that's what counts.
Must I go?
One word out of you
while you're out with me
and you know
what will happen.
Bill, you can't
do this to him.
Please! You can't!
I won't let you...
We'll have
no more of that.
You just be at
the tavern at 11:00.
Bull's-eye.
I've come about Oliver.
Look, could you
tell Brownlow...
You better come inside.
Mr. Brownlow!
No. Don't call him.
I just want to
leave a message...
But he'll want to see you.
Please! I can't stay!
Sir, this person says
that she wants to...
Who is it?
It's about
the boy, sir.
Is there news of him?
He's in danger.
In bad company.
He was dragged off
the day you sent him
out with them books.
Who took him?
Me and someone else.
You took him by force?
Yes!
And God help me,
I wish now I'd
never been part of it.
But where is he now?
And who is this other
person you speak of?
Can you take me to him?
No, no, I can't.
You want to help
the boy, don't you?
Why else are you here?
Yes, I do want
to help him, but...
Then tell me where he is!
I can't!
But I'll bring him to you.
Not here. It's too far.
Where, then?
The bridge.
London Bridge,
tonight at midnight.
But you've got to come alone.
Promise you'll
come on your own!
You don't trust me, do you?
But you've got to.
I'll be there.
Thank God. Now let me go.
Wait! Is the boy hurt?
Ill-treated? If so, I shall...
I can't say no more.
Please!
He'll kill me as it
is if he finds out.
Who is this man?
No, I won't tell you!
Whatever else I do,
I won't turn on him.
You wouldn't understand.
I've got to go back.
I want to go back.
Promise you'll come?
At 12:00.
Now, you remember,
you little worm.
The front door.
Psst!
There.
Hurry!
Look above you.
Who is it? Who's there?
Rufus! Jenkins!
Come on down. Seize him!
Seize him! Seize him!
Good dogs!
Why worry, my dear?
He always turns up!
Maybe he's taken
Oliver back to my place.
He said he was
coming straight here.
Then that is
what he will do!
Everything
all right, Bill?
No, it's not, Fagin.
The little brat
woke them up.
We had to run for it.
FAGIN: Anybody see you?
BILL: No.
I'll just take the boy
and put him to bed.
I'll be back.
Oi.
Put him back.
Bull's-eye.
Bull's-eye?
Bull's-eye,
watch him, will you?
Go on, watch him!
Sit.
MEN:  Oom-pah-pah!
Oom-pah-pah!
That's how it goes
Oom-pah-pah! Oom-pah-pah!
Everyone knows
They all suppose
what they want to suppose
When they hear
oom-pah-pah!
Oom-pah-pah! Oom-pah-pah!
That's how it goes
Oom-pah-pah! Oom-pah-pah!
Everyone knows
They all suppose
what they want to suppose
When they hear
oom-pah-pah!
Oom-pah-pah! Oom-pah-pah!
There's a little ditty
They're singing in the city
Especially when they've been
On the gin or the beer
If you got the patience
Your own imaginations
Will tell you just exactly
what you want to hear
Oom-pah-pah! Oom-pah-pah!
That's how it goes
Oom-pah-pah! Oom-pah-pah!
Everyone knows
They all suppose
what they want to suppose
When they hear
oom-pah-pah!
Mr. Percy Snodgrass
Would often have
the odd glass
But never when he thought
anybody could see
Secretly he'd buy it
And drink it on the quiet
And dream he was an earl
With a girl on each knee
Oom-pah-pah! Oom-pah-pah!
That's how it goes
Oom-pah-pah! Oom-pah-pah!
Everyone knows
What is the cause
of his red shiny nose?
Could it be oom-pah-pah?
What is the cause
of his red shiny nose?
Could it be oom-pah-pah?
Pretty little Sally
Goes walking down the alley
Displays her pretty ankles
for all of the men
They can see her garters
But not for free and gratis
An inch or two, and then
she knows when to say when!
Oom-pah-pah! Oom-pah-pah!
That's how it goes
Oom-pah-pah! Oom-pah-pah!
Everyone knows
Whether it's hidden
or whether it shows
It's the same oom-pah-pah
She was from the country
But now she's up a gum tree
She let a fellow feed her
Then lead her along
What's the good of crying?
She's made her bed to lie in
She's glad to
bring the coin in
And join in this song
Oom-pah-pah! Oom-pah-pah!
That's how it goes
Oom-pah-pah! Oom-pah-pah!
Everyone knows
She is no longer
the same blushing rose
Ever since oom-pah-pah!
Oh!
Oom-pah-pah!
ALL:  Oom-pah-pah!
Oom-pah-pah!
ALL:  Oom-pah-pah!
Oom-pah-pah!
ALL:  Oom-pah-pah!
Oom-pah-pah!
Oom-pah-pah! Oom-pah-pah!
Oom-pah-pah! Oom-pah-pah!
Oom-pah-pah!

Careful, Bill!
Please! No violence!
There! You see him?
Now go on. Quick!
Go on. Go on.
Stop! Stop!
I'll pay you back!
Bull's-eye!
Bull's-eye! Come here, boy.
Bull's-eye!
Bull's-eye, come here!
You come here, Bull's-eye.
Bull's-eye.
You come here, Bull's-eye.
They've seen you, Bull's-eye.
So you can't come
with me no further.
'Cause if you do,
they'll know you,
Bull's-eye.
Come on.
You ain't afraid of me,
are you, Bull's-eye?
Bull's-eye, you come here.
Come here, Bull's-eye!
Bull's-eye!
You see anyone about?
I don't know.
I thought I saw
someone running.
MAN: Here, that dog
was here just now.
Wait a moment,
I think I know.
Bull's-eye?
That's Bull's-eye, Bill Sikes's dog.
They're always around together.
If anyone can find
Sikes for you, he can.
Bull's-eye? Come on, Bull's-eye.
Come on, boy.
Come on, fella.
Psst!
Brass! I want some brass!
I've got to get away.
What's wrong, Bill?
Do you understand?
I want brass.
Brass! Money!
There's...
There's blood
on your coat.
Where's Nancy?
Hmm?
Bill?
Bill Sikes,
what did you do?
What did you do?
She won't peach
on nobody no more.
You shouldn't
have done that.
She peached?
Are you sure?
Well, she must have done,
mustn't she?
She was handing the boy over
to Brownlow on the bridge.
He was there,
waiting for her.
Then what did you
come here for?
Get out! Do you hear me?
Get out!
I want money!
How much? 10? 20?
No!
All of it.
If anyone at all
should come here
asking for me...
They won't find me here.
You don't think I'm
going to stand here
and wait for them, do you?
It's him.
Bull's-eye.
Quick, boys! All of you!
We're changing lodgings!
Nancy, I loved you,
didn't I?
Look what you've done to me.
Bill! Why make things worse?
Leave him!
It's me they're after!
But they won't go for me.
Not with the boy close,
they won't.
So you keep out of it!
Out the back way. Come on!
Look! Up there!
It's him! It's Bill Sikes!
It's him for sure!
And the boy!
MAN: Murderer!
WOMAN: Villain!
Scoundrel!
MAN 2: The hangman's
waiting for you, Sikes!
Get back! Get back!
Get back!
The other street!
The other street, quickly!
After you, Fagin.
After you, Dodger.
Don't bother with that.
Get out of it.
Hey, Fagin, what do I do?
Live up to your name,
Dodger.
Dodge about.
Sharpish!
Ooh!
Get up there!
Now, then. You loop
the rope over the end
of the beam there.
That's right.
That's good.
MAN:
Stop him! Stop him!
Can somebody change?
It's possible
Maybe it's strange
But it's possible
All my dearest
companions and treasures
I've left them behind
I'll turn a leaf over
And who can tell
what I may find?
Yes, young man?
And do I have the honor
of your acquaintance?
Lined?
Only the best.
Lovely workmanship,
ain't it?
I'm reviewing
the situation
Once the villain,
you're a villain
to the end
Your light fingers
Your inspiration
What a team!
Am I your partner?
More a friend
For your talent
is employable
So make your life
enjoyable
A world with
pockets open wide
Awaits your whim
to grope inside
Collections
undetectable
We might retire
respectable
Together
till our dying day
The living proof
that crime can pay
I think we'll have
to think it out again!
BOTH: Hey!
Consider yourself well in
Consider yourself
part of the furniture
There isn't a lot to spare
Who cares?
Whatever we've got we share
Consider yourself our mate
We don't want
to have no fuss
For after some
consideration we can state
Consider yourself
Consider yourself
one of us
