Saturday, September 25th:
Another heavenly day.
Yes.
It's always a heavenly day.
Every day is perfect.
Nothing but happiness.
Yes, happiness,
happiness, happiness.
I have everything that any man
or angel could desire.
Beautiful memories of the past.
Pictures, toys...
Toys.
Children play
with the dreams of tomorrow...
...and old men play
with the memories of yesterday.
Broadway.
Broadway I can see it again.
The Broadway of 1907.
The Broadway
that was waiting for me.
An innocent world
believing in a golden future.
Well...
What will I talk about?
I ain't got anything funny to say.
- All I know is what I read in the paper.
Ziegfeld Follies.
Those were the good old days.
And yet, I wonder.
Are those days really over?
Just because I moved up here
did the  have to die too?
Couldn't there be a new ?
No, no, I suppose not.
After all, how could there be
a  without Ziegfeld?
What I would give to be able
to put on one more .
Yes.
So many personalities
down there to choose from.
Great personalities from my day,
and great ones that have come up since.
How would I open?
Let's see.
I'd like a crayon and paper.
Thank you.
I think I'd open with a pink number.
Yes, a beautiful pink number...
...with a beautiful
pink and white, blue-eyed girl.
Yes. And maybe to introduce
the whole thing...
Well, who would be better
than my old friend Fred Astaire?
A great star, Freddie.
I'd be taking no chances with him.
And I know Freddie would say
something very nice about me.
What can I say about Ziegfeld?
Well, I can only tell you
that as long as there's a dance...
...a song, a musical show
and it's good...
...somewhere around or in it
is Ziegfeld.
He never cared so much
about villains, plots, stories.
The  never had a story.
The  was itself
a story of an era.
If it was gay, bright, beautiful...
...that's how Ziggy wanted it.
And, oh, I almost forgot:
The girls.
Ziggy was a specialist
at glorifying girls.
That's one of the most important
things about the , you know.
So...
Ziegfeld Follies
Ziegfeld Follies

Could you tell me

Oh, thank you.

I liked it.
When the airplanes went over...
A fellow had one leg.
Handsome, brave...
Operator!
Operator,
believe me when I tell you...
...you don't have to get me

I can spare that extra nickel.
I just want Plaza 5-5597.
- Yes, that's right.
- Thank you.
Oh, hello. Louis?
- Operator.
Operator, all I want is Plaza 5-5597.
Now,
that's Louis Sebastian's cigar store.
It's right around the corner.
I could walk there.
I don't want the world
with a fence around it.
All I want is Plaza 5-5597.
Thank you.
Hello, Louis?
- Pardon me, sir.
- Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
- Hi, operator?
Say, operator, I'd like to talk
to Colonel Culpepper...
...at the Magnolia Manor Plantation
in Chattanooga, Tennessee.
Chattanooga, Tennessee.
Hello, Colonel Culpepper?
Oh, hi, Cul.
Say, Cul, Willie Mae says...
...why don't y'all drop over
for the weekend...
...and bring Mrs. Culpepper
and all the kids with y'all.
- After all, y'all only live once.
- Why, sure.
Well, so long, y'all.
It's been a real pleasure, sir.
Look, operator...
I'd kind of like Plaza 5-5597,
please.
Hello, Louis?
- Look, operator...
I would like Plaza 5-5597.
Plaza. P for Plaza.
L for Louis. A for annoying.
Z for Xavier Cugat.
A for Anaheim, Azusa,
Cucamonga 5-5597.
- Operator.
Operator. Ope...
Operator. Ope...
- Hello, operator.
I want to speak
to Sir Geoffrey Kirsten...
...of the Frennessey Brandy Company,
Cape Town, South Africa.
No, I don't know the number.
Oh, she don't know the number.
- Hello, Porky.
- Hello, Por...
Hello, Porky.
You stink, you big baboon.
And that goes for you too, buster.
- Hello, operator.
Operator,
I would like to speak to Oogu...
...in Dumdum Proper,
South Transylvania.
No, I don't know the number...
...and I don't know
Mr. Oogu's first name.
All I know is Oogu.
Just plain Oogu.
Look, Oogu,
you won't remember me...
...but we met
at a preview of .
- Yeah.
Look, Oogu, I wonder
if you would do me a favor.
Oh, I'm glad you feel that way.
Look, Oogu...
...would you get me Plaza 5-55...
Keep moving.
Watch your step there.
Step lively. Right this way, please.
Step lively. Keep moving.
- Hey, excuse me.
- Hey.
I beg your pardon.
Now, this property that we're gonna
look at is worth $ 190,000.
He's asking 125.
We'll offer him...
...fifty-five...
We'll offer him 60
and settle for 75.
Nothing doing.
Why don't you leave the bu...?
- Well, really.
- I'm sorry. All right.
Why don't you leave
the business things to me? I... I...
Excuse me, little girl... Madam.
Now, listen, I'll get it for 50,000.
I'll save you 25.
Never mind.
If it's worth 150,000, I'll give him 75.
No, $50,000. Now stop worrying
about it, will you? I'm your lawyer.
You're my lawyer.
It'll be like the last deal.
You were gonna save me 25,000
and I lost the whole deal.
I could have made 200,000.
You're my lawyer.
- Hey, what's the matter?
- You're under arrest.
- It ain't lit.
- I said you were under arrest.
- What for?
- For expectorating in a subway.
Now I gotta take you to court
and they'll fine you $2.
I didn't know what I was doing.
Can't we settle this out of court?
- I'll give you the 2 dollars.
- Okay.
I've got it right here.
I haven't got it on me.
He'll give you the 2 dollars.
- Give him the 2 dollars.
- I will not.
Have you got any witnesses?
How do you know he expectorated
on the floor?
- I saw him with my own eyes.
- Stop arguing. What's 2 dollars?
Give him the 2 dollars.
If we ain't uptown by 8:00...
...we'll lose the whole deal.
- You won't lose a thing.
- I dare you to arrest my client.
- Oh, a smart guy, eh?
Yes, I never lost a case in my life.
Well, we'll see about that.
Come on with me.
- Pay him the 2 dollars.
- I'll break you for this, officer.
Pay him the 2 dollars.
The court finds the defendant guilty
of expectorating in the subway...
...and hereby fines the defendant
two dollars, or 30 days in jail.
- All right. Pay him the 2 dollars.
- Nothing doing.
We'll appeal.
- Oh, pay the 2 dollars.
- No.
You're a businessman
and you can't afford...
...to have a black mark against you.
- We'll take it to a higher court.
- Take him away.
Oh, please. Pay the 2 dollars.
Don't worry. I'll have you
out of here in 20 minutes.
How long have you been in here?
I'll bet you've got
the same lawyer I've got.
Hello, Victor, how are you?
Where have you been?
I've been waiting here 12 days
for you to get back in 20 minutes.
Oh, now, Victor,
don't be so impatient.
I haven't much time.
I am in a bit of a hurry.
But I couldn't help but drop by,
and give you the good news.
Yes, the court has granted
our motion for an appeal.
Look, "Whereas my client,
Victor Moore...
...here and after known
as the defendant...
...is being sued
for committing a public nuisance"...
Never mind that stuff.
Just pay them the 2 dollars.
I will not.
I never lost a case in my life.
Say, what are you trying to do?
Spoil my record?
No. All I'm trying to do
is get out of jail.
Won't you please pay them
the 2 dollars?
Nothing doing.
You're going to appeal.
And by the way,
I want you to know...
...that I kept the accounts
absolutely straight.
- What do you mean, "accounts"?
- It takes money to file an appeal.
- Well, pay the 2 dollars.
- No, no. It's too late.
I've already filed my briefs.
Now here are the accounts.
Never mind.
How much did you spend?
Well, three stenographers
for 10 days at 5 dollars a day.
A hundred and fifty dollars.
That's for preparing the briefs.
Now, $ 10 a day for taking
them to lunch.
What do you mean
by taking stenographers...
...out to lunch on my money?
- Don't tell me how to live my life.
Now then, $ 100 a day
for three assistants.
- Five thousand to Walter Wilson.
- For what?
- For an opinion.
- What did Wilson say?
He said, "Pay them the 2 dollars."
Five thousand dollars to Barker,
Barker, Barker and Barker.
- What did Barker, Barker, Barker and...?
- And Barker?
- Barker. What did they say?
- "Pay them the $2."
Five thousand
to Jerry Geisler for an opinion.
- What did he say?
- He said, "Pay them the $2."
Seems to be quite
a difference of opinion.
Oh, wait. I'm not through yet.
Now, there's $250
to my nephew for an opinion.
A hundred and fifty
to my niece for an opinion.
And $ 75 for my wife's opinion.
What are you bringing them in for?
They're not lawyers.
Well, everybody's entitled
to their opinion.
Now comes my opinion: $3000.
Oh, but we're gonna win this case.
We got an ace in the hole.
- We got four witnesses.
- What? We ain't got no witnesses.
Oh, yes, we have.
Two are coming from Chicago,
and two from Detroit.
And that makes
the total expense to date...
...$463,663.63.
For goodness sake,
will you pay the 2 dollars.
It is the opinion of this court...
...that the decision
of the lower court be reversed.
- Reversed. Didn't I tell you?
- Is that good?
Silence.
As a result of the defendant's
behavior in the subway...
...a deadly germ was spread...
...which caused the death
of two citizens.
We therefore find the defendant guilty
of murder in the first degree.
And the defendant
is hereby sentenced...
...to the punishment of death.
Your Honor, we appeal.
Pay them the 2 dollars.
Give them each 2 dollars.
Victor, you have only
a few hours left to live.
Nonsense.
I've got this case all sewed up.
You've got nothing to worry about.
I had the governor
on the phone all afternoon...
...and the pardon will be here
any minute.
What would you like
for dinner, Victor?
This will be your last meal.
You can order anything you want.
- I can have anything?
- Anything.
- You take the order?
- Yes, sir.
Well, I have an order of toast...
...dry toast.
Not the thin Melba toast...
...thicker.
And a cup of cocoa...
...and some stewed prunes
and cream.
No. Better leave out the cream.
That's fattening.
Oh, come on, Victor, cheer up.
Have a cigar.
Didn't I tell you the governor
would come through with a pardon?
Arnold never lost a case.
It's a good thing you had me
as a lawyer...
...or you would have been
a dead pigeon, sure.
You're a lucky man.
Yeah. I'm a lucky man.
You ruined my business.
You wrecked my health.
You spend all my money.
My wife left me
because I'm an ex-convict.
My children are disgraced.
I'm a ruined man,
and all because of you.
You're a lawyer.
- You're under arrest.
- What, again? Hand it to him.
- Don't worry, they can't do this.
- Please pay him the 2 dollars.
- I'll have you out in 20 minutes.
- I wanted to pay them.
Don't do a thing, Victor,
until you hear from me.
Hello, operator?
I just dialed a number.
What? No outgoing calls?
I mailed you a check yesterday.
You'll positively receive it tomorrow.
You'll leave the phone connected?
Thank you.
Please get me that number.
Hello. Is this the butcher?
This is Mrs. Ederman.
I got to have 2 pound
lamb chops right away for dinner.
No meat? I mailed you
a check yesterday.
You'll positively receive it tomorrow.
I'll get the lamb chops tomorrow.
Thank you.
I mailed you...
Oh, it's the door.
Come in.
- Mrs. Ederman?
- Yeah.
- A cablegram.
- A cablegram?
- Yeah, from... From Ireland.
- Ireland? Let me see.
- Who do I know in Ireland?
- I think you won the sweepstakes.
"Congratulations,
your ticket number 44678...
...has been drawn
in the Irish Sweepstakes."
Here. I got no change.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
I... I won. I won.
Well, somebody, I won.
Oi, Monty, Monty.
Hello. I won.
Oi, Ireland, what a marvelous city.
Is that you, Monty?
- Norma? Is dinner re...?
- Monty. I love you. Monty, I love you.
What's the matter?
You been untrue to me?
Yes. No. I mean,
I just got a cable from Ireland.
- Monty, have I got a surprise for you.
- What is it?
The ticket you bought
on the sweepstakes?
- Yes.
- Well, it won.
We won a steak?
- We... We won the sweepstakes?
- Yeah.
A glass of water, please.
What do you mean, water?
Champagne. We're rich.
All our troubles are over.
Dance. Do something.
- Oi, Monty.
- Hurrah. We're rich.
We're rich. We got...
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Monty, don't go crazy yet.
Wait till we get the money.
I haven't gone crazy.
Something terrible has happened.
What could be terrible
when we won the sweepstakes?
I met the landlord in the hall and
had to pay him the month's rent, $45.
So? We'll buy the house.
But you don't understand,
I only had $42.50.
To make up the extra two dollars and
a half, I gave the landlord the ticket.
So what?
- What did you say?
- I gave the landlord the ticket.
- Monty, dear, you should drop dead.
- I'll jump out the window.
Who stops you?
If he knows the ticket won,
he won't give it back.
But if he don't know,
we'll get it. Quick.
- He's out in the hall.
- Get him.
- Get him.
- Mr. Martin.
Mr. Martin. Mr. Martin.
Why, come in, Mr. Martin.
Funny, my wife
was just talking about you.
- Hello, Mrs. Ederman.
- Hello, Mr. Martin. Sit down.
- Thanks.
- You look good.
You look absolutely wonderful.
Make yourself at home.
Here. Take an apple.
- Thank you.
- You know, Mr. Martin...
...my wife is so superstitious
about that sweepstake ticket.
- Yeah.
- If you let me have it back...
...l'll give you the 2.50 tomorrow.
If that's why
you called me in, I'm going.
I've got the ticket here in my wallet
and that's where it's gonna stay.
- No, no. Sit down.
- You just arrived. Yes.
You know, you never
come around to see us...
...and we're always
so glad to see you.
Why don't you make yourself
comfortable?
- Go on. Take off your coat.
- All right.
Sure, take it off.
It's hot in here, you know.
Oh, it's so wrinkled.
I could press it for you.
Oh, thank you.
The pants is wrinkled too.
I could press the whole suit in a jiffy.
- No, never mind.
- Sure. Take off your pants.
Never mind the pants.
If it'll make you feel at home,
I'll take off mine.
No, just press the coat.
Do you know that I have a feeling
that this ticket's gonna win?
Pardon me. I don't feel so good.
Come in.
Here, Mr. Martin. Sit down again.
- Have an apple.
- Oh, thanks.
Cablegram, Mrs. Ederman.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you. Beat it.
- Why did he offer you congratulations?
- A relative died.
- Oh, that's too bad.
- Yeah, it's terrible, ain't it?
- Now I'm gonna press your coat.
- Thank you.
Monty. Monty.
A London syndicate is offering us
$25,000 for the ticket.
And we ain't got the ticket.
Talk. Talk.
- Talk, talk. Talk, talk.
- Well, I...
Don't say a word.
Don't say a word.
The trouble with you,
you get too excited.
Don't get excited.
Don't get excited.
Don't get excited.
Hold yourself together.
Don't go to pieces.
Hold yourself together.
- You all right?
- Fine.
What will we do?
What will we do?
Let's tell him the truth.
Maybe he'll give us half the money.
Poison, he'll give us.
That's what's the trouble with you.
You get excited.
You go to pieces.
I got an idea.
If we get excited,
he'll get suspicious.
So we'll go in there,
and we'll act very nonchalantly.
- You know, namby-pamby.
- Pamby-namby?
See, like nothing happened.
Wait, where's a cigarette?
Here. Here. Put a cigarette in there.
Now laugh.
Laugh like you told me a funny story.
Like nothing happened. Laugh.
Oh, Monty.
That was the funniest story.
Tell it to him.
Mr. Martin, my wife is so in love
with that sweepstake ticket.
Not that it means anything,
just a whim.
Mr. Martin, if that ticket did win,
what would you do?
I'd hop on a boat, go over to Ireland
and collect the money.
Monty. Monty.
Monty, it didn't work.
We was too namby-pamby.
Now what will we do?
Honesty is the best policy.
Let's tell him the truth.
- There must be an easier way.
- George Washington told the truth.
Did he win a sweepstakes?
Besides, this man
is holding back our property.
- Here. Take this vase.
- What for?
Just a light tap. Not hard.
Just a little tap on his head.
- Don't break the vase.
- Why should I hit him?
- Say he tried to kiss me.
- Who would believe it?
I can dream, can't I? Wait.
I know how to get the ticket.
I'll flirt with him.
If I only had a sweater.
I'll take this.
I'll get that ticket
or my middle name ain't Violet.
I'll captivate him.
- Am I captivating?
- I never noticed it before.
Norma, I think you've got
something there, but don't go too far.
No, just far enough
to get the ticket.
What's the matter?
Did you hurt yourself?
No.
You know, Mr. Martin...
...I find life just too dull for words.
- Ain't you?
- What?
All my life. All my life...
...l've been languishing
away in this terrible flat.
What's the matter? Is there something
wrong with the plumbing?
No, it's not that. It's my husband.
He don't understand me.
Is that so?
Well, do you know, Mrs. Ederman...
...you're looking very attractive.
- You think so?
- Would you like to loll away the time?
- Yes.
Shall I turn on the radio?
And we'll dance?
- Yes.
- And we'll have a good time?
- Can you do the jitterbug?
- Well, I'll take a chance.
Spanish, Señor Martin.
You know, my grandfather
was a Spaniard.
So that's what you're up to, huh?
The old Badger game.
You'll not get away with it.
I'll have you arrested.
Oh, please don't do that, Mr. Martin.
I might as well tell you the truth.
That ticket you've got
won the sweepstakes...
...and they're offering
$25,000 for it.
- You mean this ticket won?
- It won.
You're right, Monty.
Honesty is the best policy.

She's expecting you, gentlemen.
Won't you come in?
The other gentlemen are here.
Please come in.
Fribbins, what is all this?
The gentlemen of the press, milady.
Darlings.
How utterly charming of you
to have dropped in like this.
How delightfully informal of you
to have dropped in like this.
I mean, how perfectly
marvelous of you to have...
Well, you have dropped in,
haven't you?
And I...
Well, gentlemen...
...you have caught me
pitifully unprepared.
And now you may rise.
And now you may rise.
Come. Get up, get up, get up.
Let's get on with this.
There. Now, that's better, isn't it?
Gentlemen of the press.
Members of the fourth estate,
what can I do for you?
Tell me, pray do.
This is much too much.
A sort of a bit of a go and touch.
But confidentially, gentlemen,
and this is off the record, of course.
Of course.
But about my next picture...
I'm faced with a curious problem.
Yes.
Oh, but now, you darlings.
You adorable dear, dear boys.
I'm going to tell you
all about my next picture.
What is my next picture?
No, don't tell me, don't tell me.
Excuse me, darling.
, gentlemen...
...will be a monumental
biographical tribute...
...to a monumental
biographical woman...
...who toiled, searched, starved...
...slaved, suffered...
...pioneered, so that the world...
...you and I...
...could reap the benefits
of her magnificent discovery:
The safety pin.
The story starts in a dark, dank...
...dingy tenement in Amsterdam.
Holland, you know.
In the flat of a poor
impoverished family...
...but of rather good antecedents.
Gretchen Crematante was a very
brave and noble woman who...
...against the wishes of her father...
The baron, you know.
- Married this young inventor
who didn't have a sou, penniless.
How are you?
- Say, you're Fred Astaire. Hello.
- That's right. Hello.
I'm sorry, I can't quite place you.
What line of business are you in?
Well, I dance.
Oh, at home for the folks,
picnics and that kind of thing?
- No, in public.
- On street corners?
Oh, no. On the screen.
Motion pictures.
You do go to pictures
that have dancing in them, don't you?
I try to see them all.
I go as often as I can.
Did you see a picture
called ?
Yes.
Well, who did all the dancing
in that?
You're not Rita Hayworth?
No, I'm not, Ginger.
- Well, so long, Gene.
- See you around.
- I've got a little number to do.
- I've got a little number to do.
- You have?
- Well, sure.
- Here?
- Sure.
Say, why don't we just ad-lib
a little something together then, huh?
- Whip it up here on the spot?
- Throw it away.
Like the one we've been rehearsing
for two weeks.
