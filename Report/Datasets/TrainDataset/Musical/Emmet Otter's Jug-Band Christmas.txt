Together:
LONG, LONG AGO
THERE LIVED A LADY
SIMPLE BUT ELEGANT
AS ANY ON THE SHORE.
SHE WAS KNOWN FOR
HER GENEROUS SILHOUETTE,
Together:
AND YET...
SHE WAS KNOWN
EVEN MORE FOR...
THE BATHING SUIT SHE WORE.
EVEN SO IT WAS HER BATHING
SUIT THAT MADE HER FAMOUS,
IT WAS ALMOST HEAVEN-SENT.
MANY TIMES WHEN IT WAS
DRYING ON THE LINE
A TOURIST WOULD MISTAKE IT
FOR A CIRCUS TENT...
OH, HI, EMMET.
I'M FISHING!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
DELIVERING LAUNDRY
AND GOIN' TO WATERVILLE!
SEE YA, WENDELL!
Together:
NOW SHE HAS GONE.
NOW SHE HAS LEFT US.
LEFT WITH
SWEET MEMORIES
AND LEFT WITH
SOMETHING MORE;
WE'VE MADE CURTAINS
AND HANDKERCHIEFS
AND CLOTHING
FOR THE...
Together:
POOR...
FROM THE ONE BATHING SUIT
THAT YOUR GRANDMA OTTER WORE.
FROM THAT ONE BATHING SUIT
THAT YOUR GRANDMA OTTER WORE.
SAY, MA, THAT SOUNDED
PRETTY NICE.
BETTER LEAN INTO
THAT STARBOARD OAR.
THERE'S OLD GRETCHEN FOX

WAITIN' FOR HER LAUNDRY.
WHEW-HOO, SHE LOOKS
FRIENDLY AS A POLECAT TODAY.
WELL, IT'S ABOUTTIME

SAME TIME
WEALWAYSGET HERE.
YES, YOU'RE LATE
EVERY WEEK.
AND LAST WEEK WHEN I
OPENED THE LAUNDRY PARCEL
THERE WAS A SCORCH MARK
ON ONE OF THE SHEETS.
OH!
WELL, MAYBE I CAN
KNOCK OFF A LITTLE BIT
ON THE PRICE.
I, UH--
YOU CERTAINLY SHALL.
REMIND ME OF THAT
WHEN I PAY YOU NEXT WEEK.
WELL, I'VE GOT THE BILL
RIGHT HE-HERE.
AND SINCE IT'S
THREE DAYS TILL CHRISTMAS,
I'D REALLY
APPRECIATE IT IF---
TA!
WELL, THAT'S
TELLING HER, ALICE.
MORNIN',
WILL POSSUM.
MORNIN'.
I DIDN'T SEE YOU
SITTING THERE.
WELL, THAT'S
OKAY, ALICE.
LISTEN, YOU GOT ANYTHING
TO BARTER WITH TODAY?
OH, GLAD
YOU ASKED.
JUST KNITTED UP
A FINE PAIR OF WOOL SOCKS.
GREAT! I'VE GOT
A FEW BIG OL' PUMPKINS.
PUMPKINS, HUH?
I COULD MAKE 'EM INTO PIES
AND SELL 'EM AT A PROFIT.
WELL, THEY'RE IN THE GARDEN
RIGHT OVER HERE.
CAN YOU MAKE MUCH MONEY
ON THOSE PUMPKIN PIES, MA?
OOH, ABOUT ENOUGH
TO BUY WOOL
FOR ANOTHER PAIR OF SOCKS,
I GUESS.
GOOD THINKING, MA.
NOW YOU CAN KNIT MORE SOCKS
TO BUY MORE PUMPKINS
TO SELL MORE PUMPKINS
TO BUY MORE WOOL--
OH, ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.
LEAN INTO THOSE OARS
OR WE'LL NEVER
GET TO WATERVILLE.
STOP!
HEY, WHADYA

RIGHT, BOSS?
AAAGGHH!

OH, I'M SORRY,

JEEZ, A FELLA SHOULD BE
GRATEFUL HE'SGOTSHOULDERS...
COME ON, GUYS,
LET'S GO IN THE STORE.
ARE YOU CRAZY?
ME AND CHUCK DON'T WANNA GO
TO NO DUMB MUSIC STORE.
NAW, NAW,
WE DIDN'T THINK SO.
I'D LIKE TO.
I'LL STAY HERE.
IT'S TOO DRY IN THERE.
HEY, YOU,
YOU YOUNG RAGSCAMPS!
YOU JUST MESSED UP
MY FRUIT STAND.
AWW, SO SORRY!
RIGHT, CHUCK
SORRY ABOUT THAT...
IS THAT ALL THE ERRANDS
WE HAVE TO DO?
NOPE, BUT IT'S
THE END OF THE MONEY
WE HAVE
TO DO 'EM WITH.
DI
WAIT NOW, EMMET.
DN'T SAM TURTLE PAY YOU
FOR FIXING HIS STEPS YESTERDAY?
UH, NO...
I WAS THE ONE
WHO BROKE 'EM.
OH, EMMET,
YOU WITH
YOUR ODD JOBS,
ME WITH MY SOCKS
AND PUMPKINS...
NO WONDER
WE'RE SO RICH.
AWW, WE'LL MAKE OUT.
YOU GOTTA
HAVE FAITH, MA.
OOH, I'VE GOT
PLENTY OF FAITH.
I SPENT ALL THOSE YEARS
MARRIED TO A SNAKE OIL
SALESMAN, DIDN'T I?
WELL, PASHOULD'VE
GOTTEN RICH ON SNAKE OIL.
BUT, "THERE JUST
AREN'T ENOUGH PEOPLE
Together:
"WHO WANT TO OIL A SNAKE!"
OH, PA USED TO ALWAYS SAY THAT
WHEN BUSINESS WAS BAD.
YEP, HE SAID IT
A LOT.
WAIT NOW...

LOOKAT THAT.
WHAT?
THAT SWELL GUITAR!
MOTHER-OF-PEARL
INLAYS, TOO!
NOW, MA,THAT'SWHAT
YOU CAN GET ME FOR CHRISTMAS!
OH, SURE...
AFTER ALL,
IT'S ONLY $40!
SAY, WHAT IS
THAT RACKET?
OH, NO,
NO, NO...
OH, I CAN'T BELIEVE
WHAT'S HAPPENING
HERE IN MY STORE!
WHO ARE THEY, MA?
BEATS ME.
HOOLIGANS
IS WHAT THEY ARE.
PROBABLY SOME OF
THOSE RIVERBOTTOM BOYS.
Store Owner:
NOW SEE WHAT
YOU'VE DONE?!
I WANT ALL OF YOU
OUT OF HERE AT ONCE!
HERE YA GO,
IT AIN'T EVEN HURT.
IF THEY DIDN'T WANT
THESE THINGS TO ROLL,
THEY SHOULDA
MADE 'EM SQUARE.
HEY!
YEAH, CHUCK?
I'M HUNGRY.
HEY, EVERYBODY,
CHUCK'S HUNGRY.
NO, I'M NOT
HUNGRY...
I'MHUUUNNNGRY!
CHECK, CHUCK!

OHH, GETTING COLDER
EVERY DAY NOW.
BE WALKING
THE RIVER SOON.
AND SKATING ON IT.
GOT TO EXPECT
COLD WEATHER,
JUST A FEW DAYS
BEFORE CHRISTMAS.
DON'T TALK ABOUT
CHRISTMAS ALL THE TIME.
THERE'S NO POINT,
IS THERE?
WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH
FOR REGULAR DAYS.
SORRY.
I REMEMBER THE LAST
CHRISTMAS BEFORE PA DIED...
OH, EMMET.
I REMEMBER DECORATING
THE CHRISTMAS BRANCH AND...
PA SANG AND...
YOU PLAYED
THAT OL' PIANO WE HAD.
I REMEMBER ALL RIGHT.
SELLING THAT OLD PIANO
WAS ONE OF THE SADDEST THINGS
I EVER HAD TO DO.
SEEMS LIKE WE'VE SOLD
JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING
LAST COUPLE OF YEARS.
ABOUT ALL I'VE GOT LEFT IS
A SENSE OF HUMOR AND A WASHTUB.
WELL, AT LEAST THERE AIN'T
NO HOLE IN THE WASHTUB.
HEAD FULL OF GOOD THOUGHTS,
BELLY FULL OF GRUB,
MONEY IN YOUR POCKET,
WHEN THERE AIN'T
NO HOLE IN THE WASHTUB.
SWEET AS HONEYSUCKLE
ON THE VINE, MA.
Together:
YOUR NAILS WON'T BREAK
AND YOUR TOES WON'T STUB,
YOU NEVER GET A FEVER
WHEN THERE AIN'T
NO HOLE IN THE WASHTUB.
IF YOU LOOK
TO THE GOOD SIDE,
FALLING DOWN'S A FREE RIDE
SLIPPING AND A-SLIDING
IN THE MUD.
IF YOUR BACK IS HURTIN'
I CAN SAY FOR CERTAIN
I'LL BE THERE TO TREAT YOU
TO A SOOTHING BACK RUB.
Emmet:
WHEN THERE AIN'T
NO HOLE IN THE WASHTUB.
LUNCH WITH
THE UPPER CRUST,
DINNER AT THE CLUB,
HIGH ON THE HOG
WHEN THERE AIN'T
NO HOLE IN THE WASHTUB.
WATERMELON GARDEN,
BERRIES ON THE SHRUB,
COOKIES IN THE KITCHEN
WHEN THERE AIN'T
NO HOLE IN THE WASHTUB.
HI, EMMET.
LOOK WHAT I CAUGHT!
GOOD CATCH, WENDELL!
YEAH, THEY'RE
REALLY BITING TODAY!
I'LL BE THERE TO TREAT YOU
TO A SOOTHING BACK RUB.
WHEN THERE AIN'T
NO HOLE IN THE WASHTUB.
THERE GO TWO OF THE NICEST FOLK
ON THE RIVER.
IF YOU LOOK
TO THE GOOD SIDE,
FALLING DOWN'S A FREE RIDE
SLIPPING AND A-SLIDING
IN THE MUD.
THOUGH IT TWISTS
AND CONTORTS YOU,
THAT BARREL SUPPORTS YOU.
YOU CAN FEED
AND CLOTHE YOURSELF
WITH A RUB-A-DUB-DUB
WHEN THERE AIN'T
NO HOLE IN THE WASHTUB.
AIN'T NO HOLE
IN THE WASHTUB.
AIN'T NO HOLE
IN THE WASHTUB.
PHEW! BOY,

A MIGHTY FINE SINGING VOICE.
HMM...HMM.
ANYBODY'D BE INTERESTED
IN $50...
HEY, WHY DON'T
YOU ENTER, EMMET?
YOU'RE A GOOD SINGER...
I
ARE YOU KIDDING?
COULDN'T GET UP THERE

IT'D BE EMBARRASSING!
HI, HARVEY.
HI, CHARLEY.
HEY, EMMET...
WENDELL,
HEY, LISTEN,
YOU TWO ARE JUST WHO
WE'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR.
YOU BET.
OH, YEAH?
WHAT'S UP, HARVEY?
WELL, YOU KNOW ABOUT
THE WATERVILLE TALENT CONTEST?
SURE, EVERYBODY'S
HEARD OF THAT.
RIGHT, EMMET?
WELL, YOU SEE,
CHARLIE AND ME
WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT
WHAT WE SHOULD DO IS
ORGANIZE A JUG-BAND.
YEAH, WOULDN'T
THAT BE SWELL?!
SEE, I PLAY KAZOO
AND WASHBOARD
AND CHARLIE HERE PLAYS
A GOOD CIGAR BOX BANJO.
I REALLY DO...
UH...MY MA SAYS.
MM-HMM.
SO ALLS WE NEED IS
A COUPLE OF OTHER GUYS
TO FILL OUT THE BAND.
WELL, HOW COME US?
WELL, YOU SEE,
YOU CAN BLOW
A JUG, WENDELL.
YEAH!
HEY, THIS IS
A GOOD IDEA, EMMET.
MAYBE.
WHAT WOULD I PLAY?
WHAT ELSE?
YOU GET TO PLAY
WASHTUB BASS.
WHY ME?
WELL, BECAUSE YOUR
MA'S GOT THE WASHTUB!
OH, NO!
FORGET IT,
COUNT ME OUT!
I'M NOT IN YOUR BAND,
AND THAT'SFINAL!
All:
AWWWWW.
CO
ME ON,
WHY NOT, EMMET?
BECAUSE, TO MAKE
A WASHTUB BASS,
YOU HAVE TO PUT
A HOLE IN THE WASHTUB!!
HMM...I DON'T EVEN HAVE
A PROPER COSTUME.
HETTY, I CAN'T POSSIBLY
ENTER THAT CONTEST!
YOU'RE RIGHT, ALICE.
FORGET THE WHOLE THING.
HETTY MUSKRAT, YOU STOP TRYING
TO SWEET-TALK ME INTO THIS!
THIS IS THE FENCE
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO MEND?
WELL...
YEAH.
THAT'S NOT REPAIRING,
THAT'S REBUILDING.
DON'T JUST
STAND AROUND, BOYS.
YA GOT WORK TO DO.
JUST ONCE I'D LIKE TO GIVE
A FINE STORE-BOUGHT PRESENT
TO EMMET FOR CHRISTMAS.
AND WITH $50...
I'VE NEVER GIVEN MA
A NICE CHRISTMAS PRESENT.
NEVER GAVE ONE TO PA, EITHER...
AND...NOW IT'S TOO LATE.
HARVEY SAYS $50
SPLIT FOUR WAYS IS $12.50.
LOTTA MONEY.
THAT GUITAR WE SAW IN TOWN...
THE ONE WITH
THE MOTHER-OF-PEARL INLAYS...
EMMET REALLYWANTS IT.
BUT...$40!
I CAN'T BUY A PIANO
FOR $12.50 ANYWAY...
BUT YOU COULDPUT
A DOWN PAYMENT ON A USED ONE.
BUT IF I DO ENTER,
I GOTTA HAVE A COSTUME.
AND TO BUY A COSTUME,
I'D HAVE TO HOCK SOMETHING.
HMM...
NOTHING LEFT TO HOCK.
OF COURSE, THERE'S
PA'S OLD TOOL CHEST.
BUT EMMET USES THAT
FOR ODD JOBS!
WE WOULDMAKE
A GOOD JUG-BAND...
BUT TO PUT A HOLE
IN MA'S WASHTUB...
HE SURE WOULD
LIKE THAT GUITAR.
NOTHIN' WOULD MAKE HER HAPPIER
THAN HAVING
A GOOD OL' PIANO AGAIN.
I JUST DON'T KNOW...
I JUST CAN'T DECIDE...
MA...
I'M HOME!
I CUT THE CHRISTMAS BRANCH.
OH, I SEE YOU DID.
WELL, AFTER ALL,
TOMORROW'S CHRISTMAS EVE
AND EVEN IF WE
DON'T HAVE PRESENTS,
AT LEAST WE CAN
HAVE THE BRANCH.
IT'S A NICE ONE, EMMET.
JUST LIKE
PA USED TO BRING HOME.
YUP.
EVERY YEAR HE'D GO OUT VOWING
HE WAS GOING TO BRING HOME
AREALWHOLE CHRISTMAS TREE.
HA! BUT HE NEVER HAD
THE HEART TO DO IT.
AND EVERY YEAR HE'D SAY...
"BECAUSE I DIDN'T CUT IT DOWN,"
"THE REST OF THAT TREE WILL
STILL BE ALIVE IN 100 YEARS."
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES
YOU EVEN SOUND LIKE YOUR PA!
MA, DO YOU SUPPOSE IT'D BE
SAFE TO USE PA'S SLIDE NOW?
OH, I SHOULD
THINK SO!
THE ICE MUST BE SOLID
BY THIS TIME.
RACE YA TO HER!
HEY, WAIT FOR ME NOW...
FIRST SLIDE OF THE YEAR...
WHOOPEE!
WOW!
I FORGOT
HOW MUCH FUN
THAT IS!
WELL, STAND BACK!
IT'S MY TURN!
WHOOOO!
WOW, WASN'T
THAT GREAT?
IT'S GOOD ENOUGH.
GOOD ENOUGH
FOR WHAT?
GOOD ENOUGH
TO DO AGAIN!
HEY, NOW,
MY TURN NEXT!
WATCH, EMMET,
IT'S MY TURN AGAIN.
WHHHEEEEE!
OH, BOY!
OH, WATCH
THIS ONE, MA.
OHHHHHH!
OH, BOY.
THAT OLD SLIDE'S JUST ABOUT
THE BEST THING PA EVER BUILT.
YEAH, HE MAY NOT
HAVE LEFT US MUCH,
BUT THAT OLD SLIDE
IS JUST ABOUT ENOUGH.
GEE, I THINK
HE LEFT US A LOT.
WELL, HE LEFT
WHAT HE COULD.
PA USED TO SAY,
"A PERSON'S GOT
TO TAKE SOME CHANCES
"OR LIFE WILL NEVER
COME TO NOTHIN'."
HE TOOK HIS CHANCES
ON SNAKE OIL.
FACT THAT IT DIDN'T
COME TO MUCH HARDLY MATTERS.
PA WOULD HOCK
THAT TOOL CHEST.
PA WOULD PUT A HOLE
IN THAT WASHTUB.
MA, REMEMBER
PA'S FAVORITE SONG?
HMM...
WHEN THE MOUNTAIN
TOUCHES THE VALLEY
ALL THE CLOUDS
ARE TAUGHT TO FLY.
THUS OUR SOULS SHALL LEAVE
THIS LAND MOST PEACEFULLY.
Together:
THOUGH OUR MINDS
BE FILLED WITH QUESTIONS,
IN OUR HEARTS
WE'LL UNDERSTAND
WHEN THE RIVER
MEETS THE SEA.
LIKE A FLOWER
THAT HAS BLOSSOMED
IN THE DRY
AND BARREN SAND,
WE ARE BORN AND BORN AGAIN
MOST GRACEFULLY.
THUS THE WINDS OF TIME
SHALL TAKE US
WITH A SURE
AND STEADY HAND
Together:
WHEN THE RIVER
MEETS THE SEA.
PATIENCE, MY BROTHERS,
AND PATIENCE, MY SONS,
IN THAT SWEET
AND FINAL HOUR
TRUTH AND JUSTICE
WILL BE DONE.
Ma:
LIKE A BABY
WHEN IT IS SLEEPING
IN ITS LOVING MOTHER'S ARMS
WHAT A NEWBORN BABY DREAMS
IS A MYSTERY,
BUT HIS LIFE
WILL FIND A PURPOSE
AND IN TIME HE'LL UNDERSTAND
WHEN THE RIVER
MEETS THE SEA,
WHEN THE RIVER
MEETS THE ALMIGHTY SEA.
HOOT! HOOT!
Emmet:
DEAR MA,
I'LL BE GONE ALL DAY.
I'LL EXPLAIN ABOUT THE WASHTUB
WHEN I SEE YOU LATE TONIGHT.
LOVE, EMMET
Ma:
DEAR EMMET,
I'LL BE HOME LATE TONIGHT
AND I'LL EXPLAIN ABOUT
THE TOOL CHEST WHEN I SEE YOU.
LOVE, MA.
All:
WHEN YOU MEET SOMEBODY
THAT DON'T LIKE SOUL FOOD
THEY'VE STILL GOT A SOUL.
AND IT DON'T MEAN THAT
YOU'VE GOT NO RHYTHM
IF YOU DON'T LIKE
ROCK AND ROLL.
BUT IF YOUR TASTE'S
LIKE MINE,
YOU LIKE CIDER,
NOT WINE.
AND YOUR VERY FAVORITE THING
TO DO
IS GET A PRETTY GIRL
DANCIN'

BAR-B-QUE...
LIFTS MY SPIRIT.
I SWEAR IT NEVER FAILS.
AND THE SAUCE MAMA MAKES

UNDER YOUR NAILS.
WELL, YOU...
MAY BE POOR,
WITH THE WOLF AT YOUR DOOR,
BUT MONEY
ISN'T EVERYTHING;
YOU'VE STILL GOT THE SUN
AND A RIVER FULL OF FUN
AND YOU'LL ALWAYS
HAVE A SONG TO SING.
Emmet:
SO GET THE FROWN
OFF YOUR FACE,
WE'RE GONNA
REPLACE IT
WITH A GRIN
AND A DREAM COME TRUE
WITH A PRETTY
GIRL DANCIN'
TO JUG-BAND MUSIC
AND A MESS

A LITTLE EXTRA,
BUT IT APPEARS TO ME

THE RIVERSIDE REST, WOULD YOU?

SOUNDS BETTER'N
SELLING SNAKE OIL.

A SNAKE THESE DAYS!
WE'RE CLOSER NOW
THAN EVER BEFORE.
HOW MUCH ALIKE WE ARE.
THERE'S LOVE IN OUR WORLD,
WE'RE SHOWING IT MORE.

THERE MAY BE OTHERS.
OUR WORLD SAYS,
"WELCOME, STRANGER."
EVERYBODY'S A FRIEND.
FAVORITE STORIES DON'T END.

WE'RE BETTER
AT SINGIN' AND PLAYIN'
THAN WE ARE AT
LAUNDRY AND ODD JOBS.
YEAH.
YOU KNOW, BOYS, I'D LIKE
TO DO A SONG FOR PA,
RIGHT HERE AND NOW.
HE TOOK A CHANCE
ON SNAKE OIL
AND YOU TOOK A CHANCE
ON A WASHTUB.
OKAY BY ME, MA.
WHEN THE MOUNTAIN
TOUCHES THE VALLEY
ALL THE CLOUDS
ARE TAUGHT TO FLY.
THUS OUR SOUL
SHALL LEAVE THIS LAND
MOST PEACEFULLY.
PEACEFULLY.
THOUGH OUR MINDS
BE FILLED WITH QUESTIONS
IN OUR HEARTS
WE'LL UNDERSTAND
WHEN THE RIVER
MEETS THE SEA.
PATIENCE,
MY BROTHERS,
AND PATIENCE,
MY SONS.
IN THAT SWEET
AND FINAL HOUR,
TRUTH AND JUSTICE
WILL BE DONE.
LIKE A BABY
WHEN IT IS SLEEPING,
IN ITS LOVING MOTHER'S ARMS,
WHAT A NEWBORN BABY DREAMS
IS A MYSTERY.
A MYSTERY.
BUT HIS LIFE
WILL FIND A PURPOSE
AND IN TIME
HE'LL UNDERSTAND,
WHEN THE RIVER
MEETS THE SEA,
WHEN THE RIVER MEETS
THE ALMIGHTY SEA.
