Jake: We ain't goin' 'til we sees Miss Sally.
Joe: Yeah.
Remus: Miss Sally ain't got no
time to be bothered wid you.
Remus: An' she don't wanter hear no
talk about dat dawg, neither.
Sally: What's this all about?
Jake: Johnny's got our dawg
- An' we we wants it back!
Sally: Your dog? You don't
mean that little puppy?
Jake: Yassum. Johnny took it down to
ol' Remus's so's you wouldn't know.
Sally: Is that right, uncle remus?
Remus: Well, you see
miss sally, I had...
Sally: I see. Uncle remus'll get your
dog back to you. Now run along, please.
Joe: You gonna whup johnny?
Jake: Ya oughta!
Jake: Johnny said he didn't
care if we told you...
Jake: bute not to tell our maw.
Joe: and when we told her,
she giv'd us a whuppin'.
Remus:  Lawzy, Miss
Sally, Johnny didn't mean no harm.
Remus: He was jes' trying to be like
Brer Rabbit. I tol' him a tale 'bout de
Remus: tar baby an' he just got a li'I bit too
bodacious, and outreached hisse'f, dat's all.
Sally: Uncle Remus, i'm trying my best to bring up
Johnny to be obedient and truthful. But you and your
Sally: stories are making that very difficult. I think maybe
it would be better if he didn't hear any more for awhile.
Remus: Well, Miss Sally,
de stories ain't done no...
Sally: They only confuse him. Now I know you
mean well, Uncle Remus, but Johnny's too young.
Remus: Miss Sally...
Sally: I'll have to ask you
not to tell him any more.
Remus: Yassum, Miss Sally...
Sally: But what else could I have done, mama? I
can't just overlook it, he has to learn to mind.
Doshy: That's very true, but without
Uncle Remus and his stories,
Doshy: the child will be utterly desolate.
He needs something to hold on to.
Sally: Well, he has his
mother... and his grandmother.
Doshy: We're not enough, sally. The boy must have
friends. And if it's not Uncle Remus, or the Favers
Doshy: children, then it must be someone else...
someone of his own age. That's just good common sense.
Tempy: What you trackin' through here for anyway?
Ain't I done tol' you 'bout messin' 'roun' my kitchen?
Sally: Johnny!
Johnny: Yes, mama.
Sally: Do you know what next tuesday is?
Johnny: Uh... of course. My birthday.
Sally: That's right, dear.
And what happens then?
Johnny: I get presents.
Sally: And a birthday
party. Would you like that?
Johnny: A party? Sure!
Sally: With lots of nice
little boys and girls.
Johnny: Can i ask Ginny?
Sally: Well, there'll be so
many other children, dear...
Doshy: That one more
won't make any difference.
Johnny: Gee! Thanks! Will daddy come?
Sally: Well, dear... uh... I'll
write and ask him.
Johnny: Oh boy.
Johnny: Teenchy! Here Teenchy!
Johnny: Teenchy! Here Teenchy!
Teenchy! Where are you?
Johnny: Uncle Remus? A present
for Teenchy! Where's Teenchy?
Remus: He's gone.
Johnny: Gone? Then we gotta find him. Sump'n
might happen to him... if he runs around loose.
Remus: He ain't runnin' 'roun' loose.
Johnny: Then, where is he?
Remus: He's back at de Favers. Dat's
what he b'longs an' you knows it.
Johnny: But teenchy's
my dog. He's mine.
Johnny: Ginny gave him
to me, and you said...
Remus: Nemmine what I said! Yo' maw

Johnny: But... but... I... I love him. He... he
loves me. You should'na done it, Uncle Remus.
Johnny: Jake'll drown
him! I know he will.
Remus: Ain't no use o' you carryin'
on. Puppy's gone an' dat's dat.
Johnny: You don't even care! Teenchy's
gone... and you don't care at all.
Remus: Don't make no difference
whether I does or whether I
Remus: don't. I'm jes a wo' out ol'
man what ain't no good to nobody.
Johnny: But uncle remus,
you're... the best friend i have.
Remus: Mebbe so, but i'm dat pestered I
don't know whether i'm end-upperds or
Remus: end-downerds. But I does know dis...
I ain't goin' ter be tellin' you no mo' stories.
Children: Chick-a-ma, chick-a-ma,
craney crow! I went to the well to wash
Childern: my toe! When I got there, the well
was bare! What time is it, old witch!
Ginny: Hurry, maw, hurry!
Maw Favers: I'm doin' the best I can.
Ginny: Please, maw!
The party'll be over.
Maw Favers: If you don't quit bobbin' up
and down I'll never get this collar on.
Ginny: I'm just doin' like you told me.
Maw Favers: Well, don't forgit
what you says when you does it.
Ginny: Pleased to meetcha!
Maw Favers: That's the girl. Now you
looks pretty enough to go anywheres.

Maw Favers: Ginny! Don't
forgit your manners.
Ginny: Pleased to meetcha!
Joe: Pleased to meetcha!
Johnny: Gee, I thought
