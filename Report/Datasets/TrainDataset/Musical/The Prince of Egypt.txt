- Ha, ha!
- Faster, you beasts!
You run like mules.
- Hey, Rameses, how'd you like
your face carved on a wall?
- Someday, yes.
How about now?
You almost killed me!
Oh, come on.
Where's your sense of fun?
- Oh, it's fun you want?
- Whoa!
Whoa! Aah!
Ohh. Moses?
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Come on, you.
Whoa!
Come on, Moses. Admit it.
You've always looked up to me.
Yes, but it's
not much of a view.
Hyah! Whoo!
- Hey!
- Second born, second place.
-Not for long.
Whoa!
- Whoa!
- Aah! Aaah!
Jump!
Whoa!
Whoo!
You don't think we'll
get in trouble for this, do you?
No, not a chance.
Why do the gods
torment me...
with such reckless,
destructive,
- blasphemous sons?
- Father, hear what l...
Be still!
Pharaoh speaks.
I seek to build
an empire,
and your only thought
is to amuse yourselves...
by tearing it down.
Have I taught you nothing?
You mustn't be so hard on yourself, Your
Majesty. You're an excellent teacher.
It's not your fault
your sons learned nothing.
- They learned blasphemy.
- True.
Father,
the fault is mine.
I goaded Rameses on,
and so I am responsible.
Hmm.
Responsible.
Do you know the meaning
of that word, Rameses?
I understand, Father.
And do you understand the task for which
your birth has destined you?
The ancient traditions.
When I pass
into the next world,
then you will be
the morning and evening star.
One damaged temple does not
destroy centuries of tradition.
But one weak link
can break the chain...
of a mighty dynasty!
You have my leave to go.
Father.
Father?
You know it was
really my fault.
Must you be
so hard on him?
Moses, you will never
have to carry a burden...
like the crown
I will pass to Rameses.
He must not allow himself
to be led astray,
not even by you, my son.
All he cares about is...
is your approval.
I know he will live up
to your expectations.
He only needs
the opportunity.
Maybe. Maybe so.
Go now. I shall
see you both tonight.
##
- Well, that went well.
- Just go away.
Could have been worse.
"The weak link in the chain. "
That's what he called me.
Well, you are
rather pathetic.
Irresponsible,
ignorant of the traditions.
He practically accused me
of bringing down the dynasty.
Yeah, I can see it now.
There go the pyramids!
- You can laugh about it.
Statues cracking and toppling over.
The Nile drying up.
Single-handedly, you will
manage to bring the greatest
kingdom on Earth to ruin.
Tell me this, Moses.
Why is it that every time
you start something,
I'm the one
who ends up in trouble?
- Ah, man! Oh.
- Ah, it's Rameses. You're in trouble.
- Get down here!
- I think you owe us an apology.
- Oh, my new thing!
- I am so upset!
- You might as well.
- You'll pay for this.
- We're gonna tell the Pharaoh!
- Hmm.
- Oh, look at me. I'm drenched again.
- Hey. I figured it out.
- You know what your
problem is, Rameses?
- What?
- You care too much.
- And your problem is,
you don't care at all.
Oh, in that case, I suppose
you care a lot more than I do...
that we're late for the banquet,
for example.
I'm done for.
- Father will kill me.
- Don't worry.
Nobody will even
notice us coming in.
" Nobody will
even notice."
Ah, the young princes.
Rameses, you were just
named prince regent.
You are now responsible
for overseeing all the temples.
I suggest
you get over there...
and thank your father.
- Apparently, Moses,
someone thought he...
just needed
the opportunity.
- My lord Pharaoh.
I propose that the high priests
offer tribute...
to their new regent.
An excellent idea.
Hotep! Huy!
- Huy.
- Hmm?
- The Midian girl.
- That's a good idea!
Go get her.
By the power of Ra,
we present for your
delectation and delight...
an exotic apparition
stolen from a faraway land.
- We offer you this
delicate desert flower.
Let us inspect
this... desert flower.
- More like a desert cobra.
Not much of a snake
charmer, are you?
That's why I
give her to you.
- No, that's generous, but...
- I won't be given to anyone.
Especially an arrogant,
pampered palace brat!
Are you going to
let her talk to you like that?
You will show the proper respect
for a prince of Egypt.
But I am showing you
all the respect you deserve...
none!
- No. Wait!
- Be still.
- Untie this rope!
- I demand you set me free!
- Be still.
- Let go!
- As you wish.
Aah! Ohh!
You there!
Have her dried off...
and sent to
Prince Moses' chambers.
If it pleases you,
Father, my first act as regent...
is to appoint Moses...
as royal chief...
architect.
Well...
Right.
Shh. Come on.
Guards.
Prince Moses.
Uh...
there's a-a man
tied up in my room.
- Well, look into it.
- Right away, sire.
Please, I need water.
- I have a long journey ahead of me.
- May God protect you.
Thank you.
Hut-hut.
- Oh. Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry. l...
- Oh, please forgive me. l...
I didn't expect
to see...you...
here, of all places,
at-at-at our door.
- Mmm, at last!
- At last?
Didn't I tell you, Aaron? I knew he
would return to us when he was ready.
Miriam, do you
want us flogged?
I knew you cared
about our freedom.
- Miriam!
- Freedom? Why would
I care about that?
Because you're...
well, you're our brother.
- What?
- Be...
- They never told you?
- Who never told me what?
But you're here.
You must know.
- Be careful, slave!
- Oh, my good prince.
Um, she's-she's exhausted
from the day's work.
Uh, not that it
was too much.
We... We quite
enjoyed it.
But-But she's confused
and knows not to whom she speaks.
I know to whom I speak, Aaron.
I know who you are.
- You are not a prince of Egypt.
- Miriam.
- What did you say?
- Your Highness, pay her no heed.
C-Come, Miriam.
May I discuss something with you?
No, Aaron. No!
Please, Moses, you must believe!
- That's enough.
- You were born of my mother, Yocheved.
- Stop it.
- You are our brother!
Now you go too far.
You shall be punished.
No! Please, uh,
Your Highness.
She's ill. She's very ill.
We beg your forgiveness.
- Please, Miriam, let us go.
- No, Aaron.
Our mother set you adrift
in a basket to save your life!
Save my life?
From who?
Ask the man
that you call " Father."
- How dare you?
- God saved you to be our deliverer.
- Enough of this.
- And you are, Moses.
You are the deliverer.
- I said, enough!
You will regret
this night.

The Hebrews grew
too numerous.
They might have risen
against us.
Father, tell me
you didn't do this.
Moses,
sometimes,
for the greater good,
sacrifices must be made.
Sacrifices?
Oh, my son.
They were only slaves.
Moses?
Is this where
you found me?
Moses, please try
to understand.
So... So everything
I thought,
everything I am,
is a lie.
No.
You are our son,
and we love you.
Why did you choose me?
We didn't, Moses.
The gods did.
# This is your home
my son #
# Here the river
brought you #
# And it's here
the river meant #
# To be your home #
# Now you know
the truth, love #
# Now forget
and be content #
# When the gods
send you a blessing #
# You don't ask why
it was sent ##
Last night, the gods
granted me a vision.
I'm not merely going to restore
this temple, I will make it more grand,
more splendid
than any other one in Egypt.
Aah.
- Get up!
- Aah!
Moses! Look.
Fate has turned our little misadventure
into a great opportunity.
- Get up, old man!
- Father will be so pleased...
Put your back into it!
Faster!
This is just
the beginning.
A gateway will open to an entire
new city of white limestone,
more dazzling
than the sun.
- And here, a statue of Hapi.
I said, hurry!
- ...two great column halls.
- Stop it!
- Somebody's got to stop this!
- There's nothing we can do.
Stop it.
- Stop. Stop it!
- Leave that man alone!
- Moses!
Out of my way.
Out of my way. Move!
Who did this?
Up there! It's him.
Up there.
Moses!
Moses, what's going on?
Moses!
Moses!
- Moses!
- Let me go!
- No, wait.
- You saw what happened.
I just killed a man.
We can take care
of that.
I will make it
so it never happened.
Nothing you can say
can change what I've done.
I am Egypt, the morning
and the evening star.
If I say day is night,
it will be written,
and you will be
what I say you are.
I say you are innocent.
What you say does not matter.
You don't understand.
I can't stay here
any longer.
- Moses!
- No!
All I've ever known
to be true is a lie.
I'm not who
you think I am.
What are you
talking about?
Go ask the man
I once called " Father."
Moses?
Please.
Good-bye, brother.
Moses!
Moses!
No.
Aah!
- Aaah!
Hey, wait.
Please.
- Ohh!
- Oh!
- What are you doing?
- Help!
- Let our sheep drink!
Leave us alone!
Get away!
-Stop it!
My father's
the high priest of Midian.
You're going to be
in big trouble.
- Aah!
- Hey, you.
Aren't these
your camels?
- Hut-hut!
- No, no! No, no!
- Wait!
- Wait, stop!
Whoa!
What are you girls
doing?
We're trying to get the funny man
out of the well.
Trying to get the funny man
out of the well.
- Well, that's one
I've never heard before.
Oh, my.
Oh, uh, don't worry down there!
Uh, we'll get you out.
Hold on!
You.
Huh?
- Ohh!
Mm-hmm.
That's why Papa says
she'll never get married.
You don't have to do this. Ladies,
please, I'm really... I'm really quite...
No, not there, please.
That tickles. Ladies,
you've cleaned every inch of me.
- Whoa, l... I was wrong.
Let me through. Let me through.
I want to see him.
Ah! You are most welcome.
You should not be
a stranger in this land.
You have been sent
as a blessing.
-Tonight, you shall be my honored guest.
My father, Jethro,
High Priest of Midian.
Psst. Sit with me.
Um, all right.
Psst. Not yet.
- Oh, sorry.
- My children,
let us give thanks
for this bountiful food.
And let us also give thanks
for the presence...
of this brave, young man
whom we honor here tonight.
- Please, sir, I wish you wouldn't.
I've done nothing in my life
worth honoring.
First, you rescue Tzipporah
from Egypt,
- then you defend my younger
daughters from brigands.
You think that is nothing?
It seems you do not know
what is worthy of honor.

Moses.
Moses.
Moses.
Moses.
Here I am.
Take the sandals
from your feet,
for the place on which you stand
is holy ground.
Who are you?
I am that I am.
I don't understand.
I am the God of your ancestors,
Abraham, Isaac
and Jacob.
You were born of my
mother, Yocheved. You are our brother.
What do You want
with me?
I have seen the oppression
of My people in Egypt...
and have heard their cry.
- Stop it!
Leave that man alone!
So I have come down
to deliver them out of slavery...
and bring them
to a good land,
a land flowing
with milk and honey.
And so, unto Pharaoh,
I shall send...
you.
Me? Wh-Who am I
to lead these people?
They'll never believe me.
They won't even listen.
I shall teach you
what to say.
Let my people go!
But I was their enemy.
I was the prince of Egypt, the son of
the man who slaughtered their children.
You've... You've chosen
the wrong messenger.
H-How can I even speak
to these people?
Who made man's mouth?
Who made the deaf, the mute,
the seeing or the blind?
Did not I?
Now go!
Oh, Moses,
I shall be with you when you
go to the king of Egypt.
But Pharaoh
will not listen.
So I will stretch out
My hand...
and smite Egypt...
with all My wonders.
Take the staff
in your hand, Moses.
With it,
you shall do My wonders.
I shall be with you,
Moses.
- Moses.
Moses.
But, Moses,
you are just one man.
Tzipporah,
please.
Look at your family.
They are free.
They have a future.
They have hopes
and dreams...
and the promise
of a life with dignity.
That is what I want
for my people.
And that is why
I must do the task...
that God has given me.
I'm coming with you.

Rameses.
Moses?
Is it really?
Moses!
- Rameses!
- Where have you been?
I took you for dead.
Look at you!
Pharaoh.
Well, look at you.
What on earth are you dressed as?
Oh, Rameses,
it's so good to see you.
Excuse me, Your Majesty.
We are compelled to remind you
this man committed a serious
crime against the gods.
We are loathe
to bring it up, mind you.
The law clearly states
the punishment for such a crime...
- Death!
- We hesitate to say it.
Be still.
Pharaoh speaks.
I am the morning
and the evening star.
Rameses.
- It shall be as I say.
I pardon forever all crimes
of which he stands accused...
and will have it known
that he is...
our brother Moses,
the prince of Egypt.
Rameses,
in my heart,
you are my brother,
but things cannot be
as they were.
I see no reason why not.
You know I am a Hebrew, and the God
of the Hebrews came to me.
What?
He commands that you
let His people go.
Commands?
Behold... the power of God.
Well, uh, impressive.
Hmm.
Very well, Moses.
I'll play along.

All right, Moses.
I know you.
What's this really about?
Rameses, look.
What do you see?
A greater Egypt
than that of my father.
That is not
what I see.
Moses, I cannot
change what you see.
I have to maintain
the ancient traditions.
I bear the weight
of my father's crown.
Do you still not understand
what Seti was?
He was
a great leader.
His hands bore the blood
of thousands of children.
Hmph.
Slaves.
My people.
And I can no longer hide
in the desert while they suffer...
at your hands.
So...
you have returned...
only to free them.
I'm sorry.
Yes.
I had hoped...
that...
I do not know this God.
Neither will I
let your people go.
Rameses, please,
you must listen...
I will not be
the weak link!
Tell your people
as of today...
their workload
has been doubled,
thanks to your God.
Or is it thanks...
to you?
It's Moses.
Moses! Ohh.
So, Moses,
how does it feel when you
get struck to the ground?
I didn't mean
to cause you more pain.
I'm just trying to do
as God told me.
God? When did God start
caring about any of us?
In fact, Moses, when did you start
caring about slaves?
Was it when you found out
that you were one of us?
Don't listen to him.
No, he's...
he's right.
I did not see because
I did not wish to see.
Oh, you didn't see because
you didn't wish to see.
Ah! Well, that makes everything
fine then, doesn't it?
- Aaron!
You shame yourself.
Miriam.
I'm so sorry.
Moses,
hear what I say.
I have been a slave...
all my life,
and God has never
answered my prayers until now.
God saved you
from the river,
He saved you
in all your wanderings,
and even now He saves you
from the wrath of Pharaoh.
God will not abandon you,
so don't you abandon us.
Miriam.
Where are you going?
M-Miriam.
The ball disappears.
Where is it? In his hand.
Rameses!
Let my people go!
Still gnawing away
at that bone, are we?
Carry on.
You cannot
keep ignoring us.
Enough! I will hear no more
of this Hebrew nonsense.
Bring him to me.
- Moses!
- No!
Take the staff
in your hand, Moses.
Father.
- It's...
- Blood!
Blood! Oh, blood!
Hotep! Huy!
Explain this to me!
- Ah!
- Rest assured, Your Majesty...
Uh, yes, we were going to
demonstrate the superior might...
of our gods.
Uh...
By the power of Ra!
Abandon this futile mission,
Moses.
I've indulged you
long enough.
This must now
be finished.
No, Rameses.
It is only beginning.
But, Moses, d-didn't you
see what happened?
The priests
did the same thing.
Pharaoh still has the power
over our lives.
Yes, Aaron, it's true.
Pharaoh has the power.
He can take away your food,
your home, your freedom.
He can take away
your sons and daughters.
With one word,
Pharaoh can take away
your very lives.
But there is one thing
he cannot take away from you:
your faith.
Believe,
for we will see
God's wonders.
# Thus saith the Lord ##
#Since you refuse
to free my people ##
-##Since you refuse to free my people ##
-##Since you refuse ##
#All through
the land of Egypt ##
#I send a pestilence, a plague ##
-##Into your house, into your bed ##
-##Into your streams
Into your streets ##
- Hmm.
#Into your drink
Into your bread ##
-##Upon your cattle, on your sheep ##
#Upon your oxen
in your field ##
-##Into your dreams, into your sleep ##
#Until you break
Until you yield ##
-##I send the swarm ##
#I send the horde
Thus saith the Lord ##
##Once I called you brother ##
#Once I thought the chance
to make you laugh ##
-## Was all I ever wanted ##
##I send the thunder
from the sky ##
#I send the fire
raining down ##
##And even now I wish
that God had chose another ##
#Serving as your foe
on His behalf ##
#Is the last thing##
-## That I wanted ##
##I send a hail of burning ice ##
#On every field
On every town ##
## This was my home ##
#All this pain and devastation
how it tortures me inside ##
#All the innocent
who suffer ##
#From your stubbornness ##
-##And pride ##
- ##I send
the locusts on the wind ##
#Such as the world
has never seen ##
#On every leaf
On every stalk ##
#Until there's nothing left
of green ##
#I send my scourge
I send my sword ##
# Thus saith the Lord ##
## You who I called brother ##
# Why must you call down another blow ##
##I send my scourge
I send my sword ##
- ##Let my people go ##
- ## Thus saith the Lord ##
# Thus saith the Lord ##
# You who I called brother ##
#How could you have come
to hate me so ##
#Is this what you wanted ##
##I sent the swarm
I sent the horde ##
## Then let my heart
be hardened ##
#And never mind
how high the cost may grow ##
# This will still be so ##
#I will never let ##
# Your people go ##
## Thus saith the Lord ##
## Thus saith the Lord ##
- ##I will not let ##
- ##Let ##
-## Your people ##
-##My people ##
-##Go ####
-##Go ####
Rameses?
Rameses?
Oh. Let me guess.
You want me to...
let your people go.
I hoped
I would find you here.
- Get out!
Rameses, we must
bring this to an end.
Rameses, please,
talk to me.
We could always
talk here.
This place.
So many memories.
I remember the time you...
switched the heads of the gods
of the temple of Ra.
If I recall correctly,
you were there switching heads
right along with me.
No, it was you.
I didn't do that.
Oh, yes, you did.
You put the hippo on the crocodile,
and the crocodile...
- On the falcon.
- Yes!
The priest thought it was a horrible
omen and fasted for two months.
Father was furious. You were
always getting me into trouble.
But then...
you were always there
to...
get me out of trouble
again.
Hmmph.
Why can't things be
the way they were before?
Father.
It's so dark.
I'm frightened.
Why is he here?
Isn't that the man
who did all this?
Yes.
But one must wonder...
why.
Because no kingdom should be made
on the backs of slaves.
Rameses, your stubbornness
is bringing this misery upon Egypt.
It would cease if only you
would let the Hebrews go.
I will not be dictated to.
I will not be threatened.
I am the morning
and the evening star. I am Pharaoh.
Something else is coming. Something
much worse than anything before.
Please, let go of
your contempt for life...
before it destroys
everything you hold dear.
Think of your son!
I do.
You Hebrews have been
nothing but trouble.
My father had the right idea
about how to deal with your people.
- Rameses...
- And I think it's time
I finished the job.
- Rameses!
- And there shall be a great cry
in all of Egypt...
such as never has been
or ever will be again!
Rameses, you bring this
upon yourself.
God has come
to me again, saying,
"Take a lamb...
and with its blood...
mark the lintel and posts
of every door,
for tonight...
I shall pass through
the land of Egypt...
and smite
all the firstborn.
But when I see the blood
upon your door...
I will pass over you,
and the plague
shall not enter."
You
and your people...
have my permission to go.
Leave me!
