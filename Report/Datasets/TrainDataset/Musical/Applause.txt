How are you feeling now, Kitty?
I'm all right.
You lay down during the intermisson
and I'll give you a couple of shots.
I'll lay down
but I don't want any shots.
Telegram for you, Kitty.
For God's sake, give me.
Nothing serious, I hope, Kitty.
No, it's nothing.
Kitty, Kitty.
There's more. The one and only.
Take it easy, boys.
Hey, boys, don't forget.
At the conclusion of tonight's performance...
Hey, is there a doctor in the house?
No foolin, boys.
Is there a doctor in the house?
All right, What's the answer to that?
Is Dr. Leonard here?
Is Dr. Leonard here?
Leonard! Leonard!
Doctor Leonard!
Doctor Leonard.
Doctor Leonard.
What do you want?
Come backstage, doc.
Make it snappy.
Hey doc, how did you ever get away
from the office?
Right this way, doctor.
All of you on the other side of the stage.
I'll take you to the dressing room.
Stay in your pallet.
No, no, right of center door.
That's right.
Oh, I don't get clothes.
Go on to your dressing-room, quick!
Something she ate?
No, she hasn't been feeling so good
for a couple of days.
And then when we came off this number
she got this telegram and passed out.
What's it all about?
It's from her husband.
He got sent up for croaking a big bum
with an itch for Kitty.
Eddie was a swell fellow.
But he didn't belong to this racket.
Crazy about Kitty.
Jealous of everybody.
But that's no way to be
in the Burlesque game.
No, I guess not.
Gee, it's tough on Kitty, though.
Will she be able to go on again tonight, doc?
No, sir.
Nor for many an acts to come.
Send one of the boys across the street
for my surgical bag, will you?
Sure.
Is there anything very serious?
No, not if we work fast.
Hey, you.
Come in here. I'll need you.
On stage everybody.
Step on it.
Come on, get on there.
Hurry up, Joe.
It's your entrance.
Well, Maude Adams?
How about getting out there
and giving the cast a little of your time, eh?
What's the matter with you?
You're not getting out there?
Kitty's got a baby.
Well I'll be.
She's got a baby.
Kitty's got a baby.
Kitty's got a baby.
Kitty's got a baby.
Oh, Kitty's got a baby.
Kitty's got a baby.
Kitty's got a baby.
What?
Oh, boy!
Come on in, boys and girls,
we got company.
Gee, Kitty, the baby looks great.
Oh, isn't it cute?
It looks just like Kitty.
Oh, what a beautiful baby!
Watch that left foot there, precious.
That's right. That's fine.
That's momma's big girl.
Come in.
Uncle Joe!
Well, how's my best girl today?
Fine.
Now, Kitty, I got good news.
Just came from Maxmount's office
And you and the Highflying Company is all set.
Thirty weeks date,
you open in Toledo.
Did you make it plain about my billing?
Oh, yeah.
He came through without a squawk.
And as for you, Snoops,
look what I got for you.
From one comic to another.
Mommy, look!
Oh, Joe, that's swell.
Come on, little monkey, you run over there.
Try'em on, see how they look.
Listen, Kitty, I've been thinking a lot
lately about you.
What you two need is a man like me
to take care of you.
Kitty Darling don't need any man
to take care of her.
Ain't she getting along pretty well
without one now?
If you'd leave it to me I'd buy a cosy little home
some place for you, Nicky.
where she could grow up right.
A home for me, eh?
You want lumps growing on me, I suppose.
No, Mr. King, I got plans.
I'm headed straight for Broadway, the big time.
No foolin', Kitty. The kid deserves a better break.
Why, this burlesque racket
is no place for her.
I can take plenty care of her, thanks.
Yeah, I know.
But she's getting to the age
where she's learning things whether you like it or not.
Why, last night I overheard her trying to tell the one
that the girls brought back from
the elf's backyard.
Look. Look.
You see what I mean?
Yes, maybe you're right.
But, Joe, what can I do?
Listen, I got a cousin that'll send your kid
to a nice school in Wisconsin. A convent.
Take April away from me?
The Blessed Heart. She said it was great.
Oh, no, Joe. I couldn't.
I couldn't. I'd die.
It's for her own good, Kitty. Honest.
She'd get an education.
Grow up at a nice place.
Not in some lousy burlesque theater.
No sleeper jumps and none of the small town johns
hanging around at nights.
And there'll be sisters there
to teach her the word of God.
And she'd grow up in a nice place,
grow up to be a lady.
not a cheap little tot.
You want April to be a lady, don't you?
You bet she's gonna be a lady.
I got plans for her.
Then you'd better send her to that convent.
Maybe I will.
Maybe I will.
Let us contemplate in its mystery
how our Lord, Jesus Christ
being sentenced to die
bore with great patience
the cross which was laid upon him
for his greater torment and ignominy.
And now, April,  there's a little prayer
that goes with this, dear.
It goes like this.
Oh, Holy Virgin, example of patience.
by the most painful carrying of the cross
on which thy son, our Lord Jesus Christ,
bore the heavy weight of our sins,
obtain for us of Him,
by thy intersession,
courage and strength
to follow His steps
And bear our cross after Him
to the end of our lives,
Amen.
I know he loves me,
heaven knows why
And when he tells me
he can't live without me
what wouldn't I do for that man?
He's not an angel or saint,
I know he loves me, heaven knows why
and when he tells me
he can't live without me
what wouldn't I do for that man?
I'll never leave him alone,
I'll make his troubles my own
With all his faults I know we'll get by
I'm just no good when his arms are about me
what wouldn't I do for that man?
what wouldn't I do for that man?
Give me air.
After that one I'd better get out of here
while I'm still alive.
Come on, Hitch, stick around.
It's early.
I can't, Peggy. Honest.
Kitty'll be sore.
Anybody'd think she got a mortgage on you.
You see that rock?
As long as she keeps kicking in
with little love tokens like that, sweetness,
I'm gonna keep right on being her wide-bedded boy.
Okay, big boy.
As long as she doesn't get wise that you're giving
the runaround with every dame in the coop.
When she does, I'll get me a new mama, peaches.
And your name's right on top of the list.
Aw, baloney.
I loved that man from the start
and way down deep in my heart
I know he loves me,
heaven knows why
and when he tells me he can't
live without me
What wouldn't I do...
Hello, beautiful!
Gee, you gave me a start.
Ain't you home early?
Well, I dumped the gang, luscious.
Had to come home to my big blonde mama.
Oh, honey.
My own sweet boy.
What's all that stuff?
Forget-me-nots?
Just a lot of old letters and junk.
Hey, what john wrote your loads?
You ain't the first good-looking guy
in my life.
But the last, eh?
Who's the dame?
Give me that.
Wait a minute, can't you?
What's the rush?
Cute kid.
Sister?
To my own darling mama.
Give me that.
Hey!
What's that mean "To my own darling mama", eh?
You can read, can't you?
You mean to tell me this kid's yours?
Well, is it?
Well, what if she is?
You've been holding out on me.
Shut up. You're all alike.
Just a lot of dirty double-crossing broads.
How old is the kid?
Seventeen.
Where's she at?
In school. In a convent.
That's a laugh. What for?
I got plans for her.
I want her to have an education.
Yeah, but I always thought those joints
were so expensive.
I manage to round up a coin every month.
So that's where all your spare cash goes.
No wonder you didn't have 100 bucks
to loan me Monday.
But when I do have it to loan,
what do you do with it?
Drop it in some bookie's lap.
Well, I'm not thinking of myself
so much now, see?
But you oughta be sore if I go away.
Sure, you got a great career.
But it takes plenty of jack as well as
talent to make the grade.
I got plenty of both, I guess.
Speaking of that, how about that act of ours
you said the Keith Office was interested in?
There you are, you see?
That's gonna cost about $1200 to mount.
Classy looking props, three changes for you, orchestrations
and I'll bet you ain't got $1200.
Maybe not. But you said you'd help, remember?
Now, that ring I gave you.
I knew that was coming.
Hawk it, eh?
That's all the sentiment you got in ya.
Hawk that new overcoat
you got me too, I suppose.
No, I want you to look nice.
Yeah, well...
I guess I'm gonna be the little old excess baggage
around here from now on.
I can see you've been playing me
for a sucker.
Just a goodtime pal to keep you
from getting lonesome on sleeper-jumps.
I've been nuts about you.
But I'm wise now.
Hitch, what are you driving at?
I guess I got sense enough to know when I'm through.
You're not walking out on me?
What do you expect me to do
after the deal you've given me?
What deal, honey,
what are you talking about?
When we made our bargain it was gonna be 50/50
and no holding out on each other, right?
Now what? I find out you got a kid seventeen
and you've been blowing your dough up.
Dough we need for ourselves,
for our future, for your career.
What can I do, she's my daughter, ain't she?
I'll tell you what you can do.
You don't have to keep her
in some expensive dump like that, do you?
Now get the kid down here.
Take her out of school?
Make her go to work.
She's old enough.
I wanna keep my baby out of show business.
Okay, Kitty, that's my answer.
Wait a second. Give me time to think.
There ain't nothing to think about.
It's her or me. That's flat.
All right,
if you think that's the right thing to do.
Why, sure it is, babes.
It's time you did something for yourself
instead of dishing out the gravy
for someone else like you do.
One thing no, Hitch.
She ain't going in to show business.
I'll get her a job outside some place.
Okay, Kitty, just so long
as she holds up our own name.
Now you sit right down here
and write her a little letter.
Now, Hitch, don't be cross at me,
but don't you think we oughta think
this over a little?
Honest, the way you rush me
into things sometimes...
Will you just stop fussing and write to her?
You've been saving and scrimping all your life
to keep this jane in school.
Now it's her turn to do something for you.
Help you put away a little money
for a rainy day, right?
Oh, I don't know...
You got a great career, babes.
She oughta be proud to help you,
proud to be Kitty Darling's daughter, right?
Why, I know so.
She ain't as good looking as her ma...
maybe she takes after her old man.
Instead you can depend on me, Kitty baby,
to treat her right for your sake.
Why, we'll just be one big happy family.
One big happy family.
May God's love and kindness guide you.
As you go forth
into the great world outside these gates...
and keep you from all harm
till we meet again.
That is my prayer for you.
Little angel.
Goodbye.
Looking for somebody, honey?
Yes, I...
Mr. Greeley.
Mr. Greeley.
Cash customer.
I'm supposed to meet my mother here,
Miss Darling.
Oh, so you're Kitty Darling's little girl, eh?
Well, I'm a couple of cockeyed sewing sewers.
My name's Eddy Vermont.
I'm in the merry-merry too.
One of your momma's best pals.
Put it back here.
How do you do, Mr. Vermont?
Your ma is up at the theater.
She wants you to wait upstairs till she gets back.
Oh, how long will I have to wait
to see her?
Not more than an hour or so.
These uptown grind joints get out early.
I'll show you to the rooms.
Thank you.
You got a great ma, Miss Darling.
And believe me, she sure knows her stuff.
That Swedish movement of hers
has been laying'em in the aisles ever since I was a pup.
Swedish movement?
I mean the way Kitty slams over her number.
And boy, she packs the meanest strip and teaser routine
that ever burned a Verona way.
You know what I mean.
Not exactly.
I haven't seen my mother
on the stage since I was five.
No?
But I remember she was wonderful.
I'll say so.
Say, I got a bright idea.
Instead of hanging around this dump,
why don't you grab the Lexington Ave. local
and go up and catch the show?
Do you really think I could?
Sure.
I can't take you myself,
I have a heavy date.
But my kid brother, Slim,
he'll take you.
He's a nice guy, too.
Okay with you?
Yes.
All right, I'll get him right down.
Slim? Come right down.
I got a job for you.
Yeah, yeah.
Sorry the seats ain't so hot
but the show's almost over.
Sit down!
What are you looking at, punk?
We oughta pension off
that faded old blonde.
Yeah, she's all worked up anyway,
look at that.
Let's go away from here, please.
Okay, I'll take you back to your ma.
All right.
All right, tag along this side.
Mommy!
April, baby!
I don't know whether I done right
bringing her up here, Kitty.
but she was all harped up in seeing you.
We thought it would be a nice surprise.
It sure was, you did just right.
Oh, my, look at this girl...
Well, guess I'll be edging along.
So long everybody.
Bye.
You look like an old lady.
Oh, mother, mommy!
Oh, dear. You're so pretty.
Ain't she, Hitch?
Yes.
Oh, this is Hitch Nelson.
He's the Hitch I've been writing you about.
How do you do, Mr. Nelson?
Make it Hitch, kid.
We're all pals together.
What do you think of my great big girl.
A litttle skinny.
Ah, Hitchy. Ain't he a lemon, though?
Honest, the things he says to people I meet.
He's a bad one.
He don't mean nothing by it.
Now you sit down here.
Say, you better finish your change, beautiful.
You only got a couple of minutes.
Yeah, that's right.
If I had known
I could have company like this I... oooh!
like this, well...
Angel baby, just as soon as we get out of this joint
we'll go down to Gialetta's
and we'll sit on the swellest place
you ever saw
and stuff ourselves flat in the face.
Up short, Kitty.
All right, all right.
Come on, watch me finish the show.
I'd rather stay here if you don't mind.
All right for you then.
Kick'er up, honey.
Got any ideas about going into show business?
No.
Why not?
Don't you like it?
No.
You're a funny kid.
Oh, don't jump.
I ain't gonna bite.
Did you hear that?
Suppose that was for you, huh?
Everybody in the whole damn house
clapping and yelling.
Going nuts about ya.
Nice? No?
Why not?
You're a funny kid.
Just a little bit goofy.
But that's what comes
from not knowing what it's all about.
Please, Mr. Nelson.
Didn't I ask you to call me Hitch?
I wanna be your pal, see?
And if you listen to me you'll let me learn you
a couple of dance routines
to put you in the show.
No, thank you.
I'm pretty sure
I don't want to be in the show.
But you've got the makings
of a great artist.
With your looks and my training
it's Broadway for you, no foolin'.
You take the word of an old cue man.
That's the finale. Gotta go.
Seeya later, kid.
...and give your baby nights a lovin'...
Open up your eyes
and open up your lips
Why don't you try to get some sleep, precious?
I can't.
You oughta be plenty tired
after your trip and all.
Oh, I'm tired enough but...
I don't know. I feel funny.
All mixed up inside.
Why, precious. What's the matter?
Tell mother what's the matter.
Everything is so different
from what I thought it would be.
Sure. You ain't in a convent anymore.
But ain't you glad to be back with me again?
Yes, mommy darling, but...
I don't know how to describe it.
But New York's too big,
dirty and noisy.
And your theater with all those men...
and the girls with no clothes on.
Oh, I suppose it does seem queer to you.
Coming from a place
where they cover everything but their noses.
But things ain't as bad as that.
It ain't what you do so much.
It's what you are.
That's it. It's what you are.
Why there's a couple of dames in this troupe
good at things you'd never expect to see,
even if they do make their living shaking.
I ain't ashamed of it.
You shouldn't be ashamed of me neither.
Oh, mommy, I'm not ashamed of you.
Let me tell you something, April, baby.
If it wasn't for the dough I've been piling up
that way in the last 10 or 12 years
you would never have been to no convent.
I know. I know.
That's what I've been thinking.
I'm just beginning to realize that.
All these things you've gone through
and I never knew.
Dancing with those girls.
Horrible men staring at you.
Saying awful things.
Now don't you think I'm going to be
in this burlesque racket all my life neither.
Just one more season
with my name on Broadway in lights.
And the big dough.
Then we'll have a nice little home.
And we'll be together and be happy.
Oh, mommy.
You've done so much to make me happy.
From now on I'll try and make you
just as happy.
Oh, I ain't done nothing.
But we've got each other from now on
and it's gonna be for always.
Yes, for always.
And we'll be so happy together.
Just you and I.
You said it.
After all, snooks, things can't be all bad
as long as we got each other.
Don't you forget that.
Now you go to sleep, now.
Close your pretty eyes
and close your pretty lips
and give your baby nights a loving...
Mommy, about Mr. Nelson
What about him?
I don't think he likes me.
Aw, he's crazy about you.
Why, he said so.
Are you going to be married?
Really?
I don't know?
I don't know.
But don't you worry about it, now.
Go to sleep, baby.
Go to sleep.
Close your pretty eyes
and close your pretty lips
Oh, Holy Virgin...
by the pain...
in which our Lord Jesus Christ...
Bore the burden of our sins...
obtain for us
by thy intecession
the courage and strength
Follow in his footsteps
and bear our cross
until the end of our lives.
Amen.
What do you want?
You'll wake her up.
Get us a drink.
Oh, mommy. Mommy, the telephone.
All right, baby.
Did you have a good sleep, angel?
Yes, thank you.
Hello. Oh, hello, Gus.
Good morning yourself.
Oh, is that all? Ok, we'll meet the troupe
at the station at three.
That was Gus Weinbaum from the booking office.
We open in Buffalo this week.
Better get up and get dressed, precious.
We gotta start packing.
Got a nice cold grapefruit
for you and a swell breakfast.
Oh, good.
We open in Buffalo tomorrow.
Now Hitch, honey...
Let's settle our problems.
You and me, we can't go on like we have
with April here.
We gotta get married now.
Well, it's up to you, Kitty.
It's okay with me like I told ya,
providing that kid of yours is put to work.
She will, honey, she is going to work,
but not in show business.
I got other plans for her.
There you go again.
What else can she do, I'm asking ya?
I mean, here we are,
jumping to Buffalo with that...
and from there, well, who knows?
Now if she gets a job in New York
that means she can't travel with us.
So, are you planning on leaving her alone here?
The kid's got a real chance in burlesque.
Don't you see that?
She's got youth, looks, the whole works.
She comes by it naturally.
I can make her one of the biggest bets
in show business.
But she don't wanna be in show business.
She said she hates it.
How does a kid like that
know what she wants?
Now listen, Kitty. I'm not gonna waste
any more time arguing.
I'm not gonna get married unless
I'm gonna be the boss.
And if I'm gonna be the boss,
I say the kid is going into show.
That's final.
I don't know. Don't be cross at me, Hitch.
I'm trying to do the best all around.
If you think it's the right thing to do...
Why, sure it is, babes.
You go on in there and get her.
I'll talk to her.
I'll sell her the idea. She's getting
the swellest break a kid ever got.
We'll be one big happy family, huh?
The three of us.
We'll go to Buffalo
or any other man's place, huh?
Come on, get her in here.
April!
April, baby. Come here.
Mommy wants to talk to you.
Come here, baby.
Come to your daddy.
He's gonna pour a million dollars
in gold in your lap.
Here's to the bride and groom.
How's that?
Rotten.
Now look, now.
Don't!
What's the matter?
I don't like to be mauled
Too bad about you.
Maybe a good maul would do you good
for a change.
This touch-me-not stuff is beginning to give
me a pain in the neck.
What's the idea of that?
It's too hot in here.
Yeah?
Come on,
let's run through that tap routine.
All right.
What's the matter with you?
You've been in the show eight months
and you got about as much ambition
as a Ziegfeld clothes horse.
Can't you take a little interest
in what I'm trying to teach you?
No. I hate dance.
And I hate burlesque.
You don't have to stay in burlesque.
Just give me a little cooperation
I'll make another Marilyn Miller out of you.
I'm not interested.
Will you lay off that tone of voice?
Here I am. Trying to help you,
trying to be your pal.
You treat me like I was an ashman
or something.
Jeez, you get my goat!
Why don't to let me alone.
Let you alone?
Listen, what you need is to have somebody
wake you up and make you be human.
I got a good mind to teach you a couple of tricks
they'd never learn you in a convent.
You won't teach me anything.
Let go of my wrist.
I met babies like you before, Saint Cecilia.
There's only one way to treat them
and that's rough.
There, that's something to think about.
Oh, oh!
What's going on here?
It's just that precious infant of yours
getting temperamental again.
Don't you two ever stop fighting?
here I am, working like a dog
trying to learn her the business.
Never mind.
What do you think that dirty little
Gus Weinbaum pulled on me this morning?
He said he ain't gonna give me a contract
for the new stock season...
till I've been in the show for two weeks
and he can see how I get by.
Not only that, he practically insists that I
go with a bunch of the girls...
to a lousy stag smoker in the Bronx after the show tonight.
Can you beat that for a nerve?
Me, Kitty Darling,
dancing for a lot of drunk stags.
Well, what of it? The problem with you
and that kid of yours
is you're both getting too high-hat.
Why, Hitchy.
What's the matter with you, cookie?
Oh, nothing.
You hadn't oughta be fighting all the time.
I'd like you'd to try to be nice
to him for a change.
Try to make him love you, cookie.
Make him love me?
Yes, angel. Make him love you.
For my sake.
This is a swell night
to be going to a stag smoker.
Thought you were going to try
to get me out of it.
Well, I argued with Gus
but it didn't do no good.
A good husband you are, letting Gus send your wife
to shake for a mob Bronx gorillas.
On such a hot night.
Well, fifty bucks is fifty bucks.
Ready to go home, mommy?
No, sweetness,
I gotta go to that stag smoker.
Hitch couldn't fix it for me with Gus.
I'll see that you get home okay, April.
I gotta get going.
Come on, snooks,
walk out to the door with me.
You wait outside for me, April.
She will.
Mommy, take me with you, please.
To a stag party? I should say not.
I'll wait outside for you.
Till 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning?
You're crazy.
Now you go back to the hotel.
I don't want to go back to the hotel
with Hitch.
Please, mommy, please.
The girls in the taxi are waiting for you, Miss Darling.
Thanks, Otto.
Now you stop fussing about Hitch.
Be a good girl.
Maybe he'll buy you some chop suey.
I gotta tip him.
Mommy!
Oh, hey, I've been waiting for you.
Oops! Hello, kid.
Hey give us a kiss.
What's your hurry, sister?
Where are you going, baby?
Wait a minute, sweetheart.
Come on, baby, give me a break.
Say, listen now, just...
Say, who do you think you're messing with?
Stay away!
Hey, what's this?
Keep out of this. She's my girl.
I am not. He's following me.
On your way, guy, or I'll poke a hole
through that pant of yours.
You and Harmony Marines.
You Navy guys think you're tough, don't ya?
They don't come any tougher.
Got any other odd jobs for the Navy tonight?
No, thank you so much.
Pretty late for a little girl like you
to be wandering around by yourself.
Maybe I'll have to stroll a little way with you.
Oh, please don't bother.
Did you say "bother"?
Hope you don't think I'm fresh
walking along with you like this.
Not at all.
I hope you don't think
I'm trying to follow you or anything.
Oh, no.
Live around here?
No.
I come all the way from Wisconsin.
Why don't you go back?
Say, I think you're trying to get rid of me.
How did you guess?
Oh, I'm clever that way.
What way?
Oh, come on, be nice, won't you?
I'm not a gorilla.
But I don't know you.
Well, use your chance.
No, listen, here's the idea.
Why not let's stop somewhere and get something to eat?
There's no harm in that.
And if you don't like the cut of my gib
I'll be on my way.
Well, that seems fair enough.
I always eat after the show anyway.
Now you're talking.
Say, you're nice.
You don't look like a show girl.
Maybe I shouldn't have mentioned it.
No kidding, I like you.
And I guess you're not so bad yourself.
Come on, Wisconsin.
Boy, was I hungry.
Me too.
Gee, you don't know
how much I appreciate this.
No kidding. I mean,
I've been cruising around town all evening...
up one street and down the other.
Just looking for somebody to talk to.
Sailors don't generally have much trouble
finding company.
Oh, I don't want the kind of company you mean.
Listen, all sailors ain't a bunch of bums.
But you got no idea how tough it is
to be all alone and lonesome in a city like this.
Maybe I have.
Aw, a girl like you lonesome.
So, what's your name, anyway?
I've been so excited about finding you
I forgot to ask.
April.
April?
No kidding?
Sounds like a name out of a book.
I don't know, though.
It sorta fits you.
Sounds sweet, sort of gentle.
Just like I bet you are.
Oh, you say the same thing
to every girl you meet.
How could I?
I never met a girl named April before.
What's your name?
Tony.
I don't like it much.
Sounds like a white bootblack.
Oh, no, I think Tony's a nice name.
You do?
Tony and April.
Sounds nice together, eh?
Gee, but your eyes are blue.
Eat your chocolate cake.
April.
April.
April.
Why the little...
Hello, Ed?
Did April come in yet?
She didn't?
Are you sure?
Thanks.
The little...
Those big waves...
Gosh, they look to be about as tall
as the Woolworth building, pretty near.
They'd come down over the bough, crash.
And the ship would shake
like it was gonna split in two.
One big wave after the other.
Boy, all night we didn't know
if we was gonna weather it or not.
Well, anyway...
next morning the sun was shining
the ocean was as smooth as glass.
And right up the starboard
was the coast of China.
It must be wonderful
to sail all over the world that way.
Oh, I don't know. You get tired of it
just like anything else.
I got a week to make up my mind
if I'm gonna enlist again.
I suppose I will.
Sorry, pal. Closing time.
But the park is still open.
Okay, skipper.
I had no idea it was so late.
Here you are.
Gee, I don't want to lose you so soon.
Just when we were getting acquainted.
Can't we find some other place?
But it's pretty late.
I know just the place. It's nice and cool too.
Where?
Brooklyn Bridge.
Isn't it beautiful?
Yeah. Sure is pretty.
Even Brooklyn looks pretty.
It must be awfully late.
What do you care?
My mother will be worried.
I do have to sleep some time.
They have rehearsal at eleven.
Well, I won't get much sleep tonight.
It's too hot to sleep.
I mean, I'll be thinking about you.
Look at that city over there.
Everybody sleeping.
Everybody dreaming.
And two people like us, on this bridge
just as if we've known each other
all our lives.
It's sort of like a dream too,
isn't it?
Yeah.
Pretty soon the sun will come up
and the people will wake up.
and even you and I will go right on
the way we were before.
Just as if we'd never met at all.
Say, don't kid yourself.
I'm gonna camp right on your doorstep
the rest of the time I'm on leave.
How long is that?
Saturday. This is Tuesday.
That makes four days.
And then you'll forget all about me.
No, sir. Never.
Yes, you will.
You'll go sailing away from me,
just like that boat down there will now.
A tanker going out with the tide.
Ships have to go out with the tide,
don't they?
And sailors have to go with their ships.
And the world is full of other
rivers and bridges
with girls to sit on them
till the tide goes out.
Oh, April, I'm not like the rest of those gobs.
Sometimes I think there are people
who were just meant to be lonesome.
You know,
and then they'll meet someone
for a little while
and it gives them something to remember.
So their lonesomeness doesn't hurt
so much for a while.
I don't know how to say what I mean.
Yes, but if those people meet
the right people
they get together for keeps.
Then they ain't lonesome anymore.
But the right people
don't seem to find each other very often.
Yeah, ain't it the truth.
Well, Tony...
Well...
I've got to go home.
I don't want to, but I've got to.
Right. Let me help you down.
Good night.
Or rather, good morning.
Don't forget tomorrow. It's a date.
I won't.
I hope I'm gonna live that long.
Just don't stop breathing.
Looks like I just can't let you go.
I've really got to go now.
Well...
Well...
Good night.
Good night.
Good night, girls. Go right home, now.
Leave that taxi driver alone.
Hello, sailor boy.
Hello, yourself.
What's the rush, sailor boy?
Well, young lady,
where do you think you've been?
Is mommy in yet?
Never mind. Who've you been out with
until 5 o'clock in the morning?
None of your business.
A pickup, huh? A pickup just like every other
cheap little burlesque dame.
I'm not a cheap little burlesque dame.
No?
Just an innocent kid from a convent, huh?
Well get this through your head.
If you're gonna start this stay-out-all-night stuff
I'm gonna have something to say about it myself.
Charity begins at home, baby.
Let me go!
Let me go...
Well, what's this?
Hello, beautiful. You're just in time to witness
the signing of the Peace Treaty.
While we was waiting for you
we come to an understanding.
Everything's jake now.
April April, is it true?
Just one big happy family from now on.
Everything's swell okay.
One big happy family, hooray!
Oooh, gee wiz, I gotta lie down,
Gee.
Look at all those people down there.
Aren't there a lot of people
in the word, though?
Only two as far as I'm concerned.
Look.
Just look.
I'd hate to fall.
If you did, I'd fall right after you.
Wouldn't that be silly?
Look, the Woolworth Building.
Yeah.
That's some sight, isn't it?
Oh, it's wonderful.
You are wonderful.
Well, there's the sea.
Yes.
Look at the old Statue of Liberty.
I bet if I stood here I could see your ship
when it leaves tonight.
I should wave my handkerchief.
What are you laughing at?
Well, April, I'm not going back to my ship.
Why not?
Well, I got an important date tomorrow.
Have you?
Hm-hm.
And so have you.
We're gonna be married.
Oh, I thought for a minute you were serious.
I am.
You're gonna marry me...
and we're going back to my home town in Wisconsin
and graze wheat and have a Ford,
a radio, well, and several things.
We are not.
Oh, yes we are.
You're gonna marry me.
It's all decided.
I decided it.
Did you?
You better say yes.
I don't see why.
Because if you don't,
I'll jump right off this roof.
Oh, Tony!
Yes!
Aw, gee, I'm happy.
Aren't you?
Yes.
What I know about sailors, they
But I believe everything
you told me about yourself and your folks.
I think you're on the level.
You bet I'm on the level, Miss Darling.
You gotta be good to my little girl.
She's just a baby.
Don't worry about that.
She'll love it out in the country.
My folks will be crazy about her.
Well, that's that, I suppose.
I'm glad. I never wanted April to be in show business.
My baby angel.
What's the next thing on the program?
Why, I thought we all might all have dinner
some place to celebrate.
Where? You gotta make it early.
I have a show.
How about that chop suey place
we was at the other night?
That's fine.
Okay, about six?
Great. Well, I'll be running along.
Goodbye for a little while, sweetheart.
Oh, excuse me.
You're all right, son.
Was that the boyfreind we've been hearing so much about
I've just run across in the hall?
Mommy, I'll go in and change my dress.
Wait a minute, I'm talking to you.
This playing around with the Navy's gotta stop.
Oh, let her alone.
She's got a date with her fiancée.
Her what?
The man she's gonna marry.
Are you trying to kid me?
No, April's gonna be married.
You're telling me you're gonna allow April
to marry some lousy gob?
Oh, he's all right. I like him.
We had a long talk.
You had a long talk.
Well, how about consulting me once in a while?
Oh, turn your dapper down.
Everything's under control.
Oh, it is, is it?
That's what you say.
Now me just back from a two-hour session
at the Keith Office getting our acts set.
What's that got to do with April?
Everything.
They want her to do it with me.
But that's our act.
Yours and mine.
Well, it's all been changed.
It's April or the whole proposition's cold.
They want a younger woman in the act,
that's all, luscious.
A younger woman?
Yeah, they want it younger, like April.
She's ideal.
A smile like hers is worth a million dollars.
She's got a swell figure
and a pair of legs that...
Why, she's got more sex-appeal than...
For a dame you couldn't stand the sight of
a few days ago...
you seem to be taking a big interest in April
and her sex-appeal.
Professionally, sure.
Yeah?
I wanna see her get ahead.
I got our future in mind.
What about my future?
Now, beautiful.
Beautiful my eye. Listen, Hitch Nelson.
Nobody's gonna do that act but me, see?
I don't know what you and the Keith Office
got up your sleeve
but nobody's double-crossing Kitty Darling.
Oh, yeah?
Well, I'll show you how much
I'm double-crossing ya, wise girl.
You don't have to know I spent the whole morning
with Gus Weinbaum
begging him to keep you in your own show.
What are you trying to give me now?
Your two weeks is up tonight
and Gus is all set to can ya.
You're a dirty liar.
All right. Phone Gus
and find out for yourself.
Well, I'm certainly going to call you
on that one.
Bryant 9483.
We'll just have a little showdown around here.
It will suit me fine.
Hello, I want to speak to Gus Weinbaum.
This is Miss Darling.
Hello, Kitty?
What's on your mind?
What's this I hear about you not renewing my contract
after the show tonight?
Well, you haven't got that quite right, Kitty.
The fact is I got Lou working on a book now...
called "The Boarding School Girls".
And it's gotta have somebody in it that's young.
An ingenue lead, see?
Ingenue lead? I know the stuff the boys
there out front want...
I don't know why you shouldn't write
that book around me.
You're not gonna be left out.
I got you down for a specialty number
and a runway number...
so where do you get in to squawk?
I'm a liar, eh?
I'll show Gus where he gets off.
I'll have a contract in my own terms
in ten minutes.
Hello, girlie, get me Bryant 9400.
Hello, I wanna speak to Dave Holtz.
I'll show the dirty little...
Hello, Dave.
This is Kitty Darling.
Say, Dave, I'm closing
with Parisian Flirts tonight.
How about grabbing yourself a real bet
for your Summer Widows?
Thought I'd give you first crack
instead of fooling around with other stuff.
Well, you better take him.
I got nothing for you.
Twenty managers killed in the rush.
I got plenty of friends in this town.
Ah, save your nickels, you may need them.
None of your wisecracks, Hitch Nelson.
It takes a wise girl to know when to quit
and that's no wisecrack.
Quit what?
Show business. Can't you see you're all washed out?
Why, you...
What have you got left to give'em?
You've been in it for twenty years.
Why kid yourself? You ain't kidding anybody else.
You mind your own business.
I'm not letting any cheap comic
tell me how to run my affairs.
Cheap comic, eh? If it hadn't been for me
telling you how to run your affairs
you'd have been through long ago.
You're a joke. You're just a fat old woman.
Look at yourself in the mirror.
Look at that neck, look at them wrinkles.
You better get wise to yourself and figure out
where the coffee and cake's money is coming from next season.
Right in that room is your meal ticket
from now on.
And you let her marry some dope from the Brooklyn Navy
outright when you needed her most.
She's gonna marry him too, if I have to buy a tin cup
and sell pencils on Broadway.
Not after I have a talk with her tonight.
If you dare to open your trap to her tonight
we're through.
I'm fired, eh?
Well, you're wrong. I quit, see?
So what do you think of that?
I'm sick of seeing you around here.
I guess I got everything out of you I want, babes.
I got plans
and they don't include any old blondes.
Get out! Get out before I kill you.
See you in the show business, beautiful
Mommy, you look tired.
I am a little.
Maybe you'd better rest a little for a while
instead of coming to dinner with us.
I think I'd better.
You two don't want any old ladies along anyway.
You run along to your sailor boy.
Mommy. Mommy.
Tell me, what's the matter?
Mommy, I'm not going to be married.
I'm never going to go away from you now.
You heard Hitch and me
yelling at each other, is that it?
Come on now, cookie.
Don't go taking it that serious.
You know how Hitch and me are,
always rowing about something.
He don't mean what he says half the time.
By tomorrow we'll both of us forget
all about it...
Everything's okay.
Don't let a thing like that get you down.
You run along now see your sailor boy.
Stop being that way.
No, mommy. I'm going to tell Tony
I can't marry him.
But you must marry him, snooks.
After all we talked over?
I'm counting on it.
You don't know how much it means to me.
No, mommy.
I just can't, that's all.
Now you listen to me, young lady.
I'm your ma, and I say you're going right down
to dinner and fix it up.
and there'll be no more talk about it.
All right, mommy.
I'll fix it up.
And when I come to the theater tonight
I wanna be sure you're gonna tell me everything's okay.
It will be.
It will be.
Come on now, kitten.
You gotta do this.
And don't worry about me.
I'm not a black number yet.
I know, mommy.
Boy, that's happy music.
Just for us.
Wanna dance?
No.
Wish you didn't have to work tonight.
We could go to Coney Island.
I don't like Coney Island.
Aw, come on, you don't.
You did the other night.
That was the other night.
What's the matter with you, honey?
Why? Nothing.
Oh, yes there is.
Come on, let's have it.
Tony, I'll tell you.
I don't know how to say it, but...
Tony, I don't want to get married.
Say, don't say things like that,
I got a week heart.
Tony, I mean it.
I like you an awful lot
and all that...
but I just can't think of getting married
right now.
What's the matter, honey?
What's happened?
Nothing.
I don't think you'll be able to understand, but...
Being born on the stage and all
well, getting married and leaving,
it seems to be giving up everything.
You told me the other night
you wanted to get out of the show business.
That's how I thought I felt.
When I come right down to it,
I just can't, that's all.
You'll never know, Tony,
what it feels like to be on the other side
of those footlights.
and to hear them clap and clap for you.
It does something to a girl.
I don't know what.
April, I don't believe a word you're saying.
Either you're lying to me
or else you've just been kidding yourself.
Now, come on,
let's dance and forget about it.
I don't want to dance.
I want you to get it through your head
right now.
This is it, really.
Mother signed a new contract today
for a new show.
And there's a chance
for me to go with her in a splendid part.
If I don't take it
I know I'll be sorry all my life.
Then we'll both be miserable.
But listen, honey.
That's no life for you.
Well, I'm not so sure that married life
in some godforsaken farm is a life for me either.
After all, I'm young.
People tell me I'm pretty.
Here I've got a big chance.
I might be a star.
Now, I ask you, Tony...
what girl wouldn't grab at the chance
to land on Broadway in a big show?
None, I suppose.
Not since you're locked to them.
Let's pray it ended up
with nothing to be locked with right now.
Tony, don't look at me like that.
Makes me feel terrible.
I really think
you're an awfully sweet boy, but
after all, when it comes to love,
why, I've only known you five days.
You think of jumping into something
and giving up a whole career...
Well, Tony, you ought to understand.
Sure.
I mean,
we'll still have lots of fun together.
Just the same. Go to lots of parties.
Why, we might even still be engaged.
No. I wouldn't want to feel
like I'm tying you down.
Guess I'd better go back to my ship.
You mean, enlist again?
Yeah.
Sailing for the West Indies.
I've always wanted to see the West Indies.
But you'll come back.
Sure, some day.
What time is it?
Eight o'clock, almost.
I could just make it if I hurry.
Tony!
You're angry with me.
I didn't want you to be.
Tony, please try not to hate me.
Please try to understand.
This was the best way for us both.
I don't hate you.
I just gotta hurry, that's all.
You ought to be getting down
to your show too, don't you?
I'll walk to the subway with you.
It's on my way.
You'll be late.
I don't care.
Check, please.
Seventh floor, mam.
Good night, Jim, I'll see you in the morning.
Good night, honey.
Well,
thanks for coming down with me, April.
Oh, that was all right.
Well, here's my train.
Bye, April.
Bye, Tony.
Don't cry, kid.
There'll be another one along any minute.
Cheer up.
April!
April!
April!
April! April!
Aw, be quiet!
Where's April?
Where's April?
Mother!
What's the matter?
Help me to my dressing room
Well I'll be...
Where did she get?
Mother, you're sick.
Don't worry about me.
Is everything all right?
Everything's fine.
Are you gonna be married right away?
No, I sent him back to his ship, ma.
What's this you're saying?
You lie down, you'll feel better.
Tell me, tell me.
Don't worry, it's all over.
I sent him away.
I guess it is jolly life on board.
It's a good thing we found out in time.
Oh, nothing matters now but you, mommy.
We'll always have each other.
Nothing's ever going to separate us again.
Oh, my God. What have you done?
What have I done?
Mommy, you're not well.
My baby, my little baby.
Well, this is a swell time to be showing up
for a Saturday night show.
What's the matter with her?
Drunk?
Well, what if she is?
Drunk as a fool,
look at her lying there, the gin-soaked old...
You let my mother alone!
You men make me sick.
You don't care about anything
as long as you can shove somebody
on your filthy stage.
and make them shake for a bunch of gorillas.
Yeah? Well that talk don't get me anywhere.
So far as I'm concerned Kitty Darling's finished.
Here I talk to Gus Weinbaum
trying to keep her in the show here...
and look at her, blind, paralyzed,
Saturday night with nobody to take her place.
I'll take her place.
I'll get out there and get those gorillas
your money's worth.
Now what do you think of that?
Me take a chance on a dumb chorus girl
to fill a specialty number?
You're crazy!
Listen, she ain't so dumb.
I've been rehearsing her for weeks.
She's swell, I'm telling ya.
Anyway ain't it be better
take a chance with the kid?
Well, maybe it is.
Hop to it, kid. But you'd better be good.
Come on, baby, wake up.
Oh, I'll be good all right.
I'll get out and give them what they want.
I'll show them, I'll show them!
Now you're talkin'.
You get out of my way.
Well I'll be...
Come on, get out there and play again.
No!
Come on, get out there.
No!
Come on, girls, get out there.
Do something.
Go ahead, get onstage there...
Come on, you get onstage too.
Tony!
Tony!
I came back because I thought,
well, maybe...
Take me away from this terrible place.
You mean it?
I never want to be in the stage again.
You know, I had a hunch
you weren't telling me the truth.
Aw, come on, what's it all about?
It's mother.
Tony, I can't go away and leave her now.
She's sick. She needs a home.
Then let her come with us.
That'll be swell.
Come on, let's go in and talk to her.
I bet I can make her see it our way.
It would be wonderful if she would.
We'll always be together, won't we?
Yes, honey.
All three of us.
All three of us.
