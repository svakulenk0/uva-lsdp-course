Great Freedom No. 7
Jens! Man, where are you?
I thought you're ready
but you're sitting here
looking at the moon?
When that bloke plays
I always have to think of Hannes.
You call that whining "play"?
I play at least as good
as he can whistle.
could play.
Jens, could he play? That was
like an orchestra when he got going.
Hannes' kind of a magical animal, I know...
Whatever he does, he can do it
in any case better than I...
Of course he can, freshwater Harry!
Only one thing he could not:
stay on board as a sailor.
Because he didn't want to, dimwit.
'Cause he didn't want!
Hannes is the uncrowned king
of the Great Freedom!
Someone like that
can't hold a candle to him!
- Hannes , if he wants!
- He can kiss my...
He's got a whole other prospects, eh!
- Now how long do I have to wait for you?
- Where do you want to go?
You're asking questions...!
- To the Great Freedom, mate!
- To Hannes of course!
- Without me then.
- Ever heard a thing like that?
Seven months he wasn't in Hamburg,
and doesn't want to go ashore?
You and your Hamburg...
guess it's the same bang business
as in any other port,
be it Frisco,
Valparaiso or Shanghai.
You oughta come to Cologne!
where the fun is!
?... Jens -
do ?
?
No.
Never heard of.
What?
Yep...
...think I'll come along
and embosom your Hamburg.
Speaking of bosoms...
I hope you're morally steadfast?
Mate, the Hamburg girls...!
If any of your Hamburg girls appeals
to me, you can call me .
Well if we were in Cologne now...!
See you!
Hey... that's Hannes!
And when a young stranger
is greeting you
when passing by
and you don't know him,
Come, my little darling,
please be mine, don't say no!
Until tomorrow morning at nine
you shall be my only one.
If you want I'll be true to you
till the evening at half past nine!
Link arms with me,
we'll go strolling together now
All now!
On the Reeperbahn
at half past midnight
you enjoy yourself,
it will sort itself out
on the Reeperbahn
at half past midnight!
One who's never been in a cozy night
strolling up and down the Reeperbahn,
is a poor wretch,
for he hasn't seen
my St. Pauli,
St. Pauli by night!
Before the next riding tour starts
a snappy triple fanfare
for my friends
Fiete Brinkmann, ship's cook -
and Jens Peersen -
able-bodied seaman of the Padua!
And when we come to Hamburg, we know
what we will do,   - All sing along!
we'll buy us one for fifteen pence
at the corner of David Street.
Hurray, hurray,
hurray, hurray, hurray,
and when our pay's all blown,
we'll go to sea again.
Riding is fun!
Riding gives pleasure!
Jens, Fiete!
Come here, come here, girl!
Mount!
Let's have a drink!
Wait a moment...
Madam...?
- I've spoken with the director
of the Hansa Theater...   - Fine.
- See you later?
- Sure. Without?
- Sure.   - All right.
- I'll be waiting in the car outside.
Anita!
- I've known you for fifteen years!
- At least!
- And you're looking better each time!
- You really think so?
Get ready for the next tour!
Say, what was that all about
in the loge, with the lady?
What could have been? Nothing!
- Better watch it, chap!
- Now don't make a fuss, will you?
- Better come out with some good rum!
- Some ?
Yes, some !
You've gotta be kidding!
For two scoundrels as you
I spare no expenses!
Hannes...
Here...
But that's...
that's our Padua!
Yes, I made it for you, Hannes!
- We did, we!    - We?
- Here, read: "from Jens and Fiete".
Now what did  do at it?
I drank up the bottle! Otherwise
you couldn't have put in the ship!
Well, Jens? Well, Fiete?
How was the trip?
Record, eh! 68 days from
Spencerport to Cape Lizard!
Man alive, eh!
That's quite something...
Our old Padua went along
like some sewing machine.
The old man was pretty
rough on the tub, eh!
At each watch there was
at least once "all hands on deck".
At the Cape, we didn't get out
of our wet rags for four days.
Cooking? I couldn't
even think of cooking...
And the green water
stood on deck all the time...
Hannes...
on this voyage
you were missed, man.
Where's the rum?
Anita, I ordered three rum!
Cheers all!
Jens... Fiete...
come 'ere... Cheers!
All ready for the ride!
On your mark... ready...
Who says "ready"?
No one's saying ready!
If anyone here says ready,
It's we saying ready!
Fiete ready? Jens ready?
All READY!
Say, is that still
the same old donkey?
- Sure!
- Eh, Hannes....
Who's she?
- That's Margot.
- Never saw her here before!
You can't...
She's been here for only six weeks.
- Cute...
- Looks damn feeble.
- What, Margot?
- No, the ass!
Hannes! You're to come
to the harbor hospital.
- Say, what am I to do there?
- It's about your brother...
My brother? He can kiss my...
He can go jump in a lake!
The nurse says
he is nearing his end...
- Hannes...
- What?
In that case... Hannes...
Well alright...
Is the old issue between them
still not straightened out?
That will never be sorted out, man.
Up next is the famous ride
on the donkey Bimbo!
The management will pay
who succeeds in riding three times
around the arena without bucking off.
Kicking, hitting and biting on
the part of the rider is not allowed!
- I'll ride him.   - Don't...
- I'll ride him!   - Fiete, don't!
That 10 marks are for the son of
the old Brinkmann!   - Fiete, no...!
Nice tiles...!
Hannes...
gotta help me, Hannes.
Ah. Again.
No.
But it's... not for me.
I'm finished.
Gisa...
the girl's... still waiting for me.
I wrote... everything down.
- ...Address...
- No.
I've always helped you...
I gave you all my savings,
so that you could go to naval school,
and what did you do with the money?
You blew it.
And I had to slog on
as a plain sailor.
And keep on grindind my bones,
and for whom? For you!
Then I saved again, because I also
wanted to go to naval school, yeah...
and when I was in Australia
with the Padua,
you secretly went to my locker,
guess you still remember, no?
Second drawer bottom left,
under the hankies.
There you simply stole my money!
Then mother fell ill,
and you didn't even look after her.
Then mother died while I was at sea,
and when I came back home
other people had buried her.
I won't forget that for all my life,
With a rascal as you I don't
want to have anything to do any more!
You ruined me!
And because I didn't want to start
from the beginning for the third time
I did stay on land,
where I do not belong at all...
with Anita at the Great Freedom.
No, man -
as long as we're both alive...
we no longer have anything...
What's with him?
I think he's afraid!
Cashier, please!
What do you say now?
What's your name anyway?
- Jens Peersen...
- Jens?
Oh, now that's
a beautiful name, isn't it?
Yes, true enough!
Beautiful people have beautiful names!
- God, you're so pretty!
- When did you sign off, eh?
This morning!
Smokestack's burning, baby, eh!
Jens Peersen's going mighty
strong on his chest again!
Oh Jens... I really like strong men!
Check!
Say, Fiete... who told you
the trick with Bimbo's tail?
Trick?
I seee...!
That was a trick?
Well, thank you very much!
Anita... when will be the next ride?
Evening, Hannes!
Watch out, Admiral!
Hey... give me a double aquavit.
I think you should sing again, Hannes.
That's the sixth round
without intermission.
What about Jan?
Did anything happen?
Hannes!
Here... the sheet anchor
at the foredeck is missing!
Hannes...
- Did anything happen?
- Yes!
One more...
Hannes, you're not going back to sea...?
'Course not - I have to go away for
a few days, because of my brother.
- You'll come back, will you?
- Where else can I go.
Where are you going?
Are you looking for me?
Good morning...! Tcha...
Actually, I came to see
Miss Gisa Häuptlein.
What do you want from my daughter?
It's... I come from Hamburg.
My name is Kröger.
- Kröger... from Hamburg?
- Yes.
I see...
...that's you.
So you're the one, who Gisa...
and you still dare to come here?
Now hold your horses...
I don't even know your daughter.
Oh really...
but back then in Bremen
when Gisa was on a visit
with my sister,
there you knew her quite well, no?
Mrs. Häuptlein, the one
who knew your daughter...
After you had your pleasure
you suddenly disappeared!
and dumped the poor girl - you rascal!
Now would you please calm down!
The one who knew your daughter
was my brother.
And what's been wrong between them they
better should have sorted out themselves!
Jan!
I'm just the elder brother.
- Good morning.
- What about Jan?
He sends you his brother,
because he's too cowardly to come.
He probably needs money again.
I dont want to hear or see anything
about that whole Kröger rabble anymore!
- You seem to have a screw loose, eh!
- Forget it, it's useless.
Now come on, really...
What about Jan?
My brother...
well... he's dead.
No...
No!
Yes.
Two days ago...
blackwater fever.
And a rascal...
my brother sure wasn't a rascal,
don't you think that.
After all everyone
can have bad luck in life.
Well, and the money,
the money you gave him,
he gave it to me
to return it to you.
Because I promised my brother
that I will look after you.
But I think
that won't be necessary now,
as you have such a nice home here...
"Home", Mr. Kröger -
- If you knew...
- Yes?
It's hell,
from morning to night...
once one had tough luck
in a small town.
But do you...
have a child from my brother?
- No, it's not that.
- Ah, I already thought...
Guess you've been lucky.
But in any case, it would be fine
if you'd get out of here for a while!
Where can I go?
Where you can go?
I take you with me...
to Hamburg!
- To Hamburg?
- Yeah, I know a lot of people there,
we'll soon find an employment for you.
Yes, girl -
you can count on me!
We Krögers, we sure ain't no rabble!
Finally getting some peace...
finally no more accusations!
That would be fine...
But I can't, Mr. Kröger.
Can't do that to mother.
She hasn't got it easy either,
since father's dead.
Fine - you can still think it over!
I'm going back later this evening -
if you want to find me sometime:
Hannes Kröger, Hamburg,
Great Freedom will do.
Well then, cheers...
Thank you, Mr. Kröger!
And...
Poor Girl!
Does the affair with that rascal
from Bremen never end?
You shouldn't bad-mouth Jan, mother...
He's dead and I once
was very fond of him.
Oh, I probably should be thankful
that he got people gossiping over you.
You should only hear
what people are saying.
Only good thing is that your father
didn'd live to see this.
Leave father out of this.
He'd understand me.
Your father? He would have
chased you out of the house!
Our daughter, a sailor sweetheart!
- One has to be ashamed in front of
the people!   - You're ashamed of me?
I see...
I didn't know that, mother...
I didn't believe that strangers are
more important to you than your child.
Gisa!
Kid!
Well, girl?
Where's the journey going?
- To Hamburg!
- Bravo.
So...
now come on in, girl.
Guess I first show you my mansion.
Now this, that's my parlor.
Over there, that's my parents,
and beneath the banjo...
there's a picture of captain Jürs
of the Padua.    - Ah!
There's a parrot!
Does he talk?
He better not!
And here's my bunk...
It already has seen many a storm!
And over there's the caboose!
- ? Is that...
- No, girl, that's the kitchen.
- What you mean, is half a floor
downstairs.    - I see!
You're still standing there, kid -
make yourself comfortable!
I just have to wash my hands.
So...
- Are you going away again, Mr. Kröger?
- Sure, I have to go to my joint!
But tomorrow morning
I'll be back.
So... well.
Gisa, what's the matter with you?
- Nothing.
- That's fine.
I already thought, because
it's all a bit unfamiliar to you...
but I think you will get
accustomed to me.    - Yes.
I first have to get acustomed
to you, too... Gisa.
But we'll have to find
another name for you.
... no Hamburger
would know what that means.
- .
- Yes... !
Too bad it's no name for a girl.
But it has to start with a 'P'.   - Why?
Everything that starts with a 'P'
brings me good luck.
,
St. ...
How about...
.
?
If it sounds Greek to you:
it's Spanish!
It means "the white dove".
Oh, but I'm no white dove!
But you're some
little birdie too, eh!
And when a white dove has lost
its way and comes on board,
the sailors know they will
soon be in the harbor.
And such a small animal
a sailor won't harm.
Well then cheers... Paloma.
Holy moly!
We haven't got anything to eat!
- Won't you get anything?
- Well I do, but you!
- Oh, it doesn't matter...
- Now come here... Paloma.
Here's five mark...
go downstairs our house...
there's a pub - ...
give my regards to Mrs. Börgel,
that's the innkeeper...
tell her to give you
something yummy for eats.
Couldn't I eat a bite in your bar?
At the Hippodrom?
That's where the wicked pirates are!
That's no place for small kids!
My first, he was a sailor
who was tattooed on his chest.
He wore ocean blue trousers
and I was so terribly shy.
He took my hand and he promised
to be faithful, and gave me his word
you still think
you will never get over it.
For parting he gave me two florins
and he said to me so tenderly
Love, you have to be a bit patient,
I come back to you in a year.
you still think
you will never get over it.
- Another round, Mr. Scholz?
- Think we can handle one more, Mrs. Börgel.
WHO DARES WINS
There's something wrong
with that box!
You just haven't got
the knack of it!
- What will it be, Miss?
- Mr. Kröger sends me...
he'd like to have
a little bit to eat.
I see... Mr. Kröger wants
something to eat again.
So choose something... for Mr. Kröger.
- Hey... dimwit...
- Sorry...
Owww!
The box is fantastic! ...
...in order.
You brought me good luck, little miss.
May I, out of thankfulness... oops...
invite you for a drink?
- Thanks.   - Don't say "Thanks"
unless you enjoyed it!
- But I didn't want any beer...
- But I. Cheers!
Better take it along, Miss,
Mr. Kröger's used to it.
- What do I owe you?
- Nevermind. I put it on Kröger's tab.
Good Evening.
Good Evening...!
See you!
She's nice... ain't she?
She's a floosie!
Who knows where Kröger
picked her up!
Cashier!
You cut quite a dash, eh!
Want to ruin our little Anita's
whole nightclub?
- Have you been true to me?
- As true as you've been to me!
We'll have to talk about that later!
Well, and you two lunatics?
- Is it still the great love?
- Guess it is, Hannes!
Leave a little bit over
of that skinny herring!
Don't listen to Hannes...
you're my one and only!
Well then Anita -
a round of kümmel and beer!
Is there someone?
I already thought
I came here for nothing again.
I brought the sea chest and the stuff.
If you'd sign here...
I put everything inside.
It's from the harbor hospital.
Bye.
- Today I'll go home with you.
- But Jens...
I already told you, it's impossible.
- Today I'll go home with you...
- No!
Now hold still, will you!.
Fine... all right...
The issue is over,
over and done.
I'm not dependent on you?!
Man... you're juiced!
Or do you perhaps think
I'm dependent on you?
Jens - now be reasonable!
One should have hair....
Whether you think
that I'm dependent on you?
If you don't keep quiet I'll go.
Then I'll go with you.
And he's... not dependent on her!
- So send the girl to me tomorrow...
- That's fine.
- ...and if she's busy and proper...
- Wellenkamp...
I'd put my shirt on Lisa.
Allow me to introduce - Kröger.
Riding is fun!
Whether you think
that I'm dependent on you...
I'm not dependent on you.
I thought you'll stay?
Oh, well.. eh...
I can't right now...
- Still have an appointment later.
- Tonight? Who is it?
Well, with... with the...
It's business.
I know that kind of business.
You know shit... babe!
give me your heart,
be my dear...
- They don't give me no more kümmel!
- Go home, you've got enough!
Enough...? Enough!?
Do you think
I'm dependent on you?
Closing time! The customer
is liable to prosecution as well!
Jacko, quiet!
Good morning!
- Can I have a few tabs?
- Work already over?
"Already"...?
I'm back from the night shift!
I'm dog-tired,
looking forward to my bed!
- Morning...
- What's this?
Mr. Kröger?
Up so early?
I return the mug...
and then I'd like to take
a little bit upstairs for breakfast.
Think I'll risk one more, eh?
Wiseguy...
- ...and a bar of raspberry chocolate.
- I see...!
Why "I see"?
It's not what  think.
The lady who brought the beer
yesterday is in fact...
a distant relative of mine,
is this information enough?
Does she also work at the Hippodrom?
No, she does not work at the Hippodrom,
but if you really want to know,
she's working as a saleswoman
for my friend Wellenkamp
in his store,
that's all there is!
Many thanks!
Good afternoon!
- I want a , Miss.
- Oh... yes.
- Don't you understand me?
- No.
Don't you have a ?
- A , please?
- A , Miss!
A
Just a moment, yes?
Mr. Wellenkamp?
- How can I help you, please?
- I don't want no .
- I want a tie.
- A tie?   - Yes.
Maybe you want to help
yourself? Mr. Wellenkamp!
What will it be, sailor?
- Do you have a ?
- We have.
- That's fine.
How about that one perhaps?
Well... looks really cute!
- Don't you recognize me?
- No.
Or perhaps you take Pepita -
matches with everything.
But I need one
who only matches me.
Sorry, I'm afraid I can't help you
with that - that's all we have in ties.
- Who's talking of ties?
- Me.
Oh... well then...
let's see... all right?
- And how do you like that one?
- Well... guess it's a matter of taste.
What do you think... honestly?
- Awful.
- That's right!
I take it.
You're spending way too much
money for knick-knacks.
You better should put
something away early enough.
One has to put up with the loss.
Don't make fun of an elderly woman
who means well for you.
"Elderly woman"?
I didn't hear that, Mrs. Kaasbohm.
With your figure? You're still crisp
and as fresh as a daisy.
You've got no ethical earnestness
at all, Mr. Scholz.
Earnestness I've got indeed,
Mrs. Kaasbohm, but no time.
It's pretty...
but as you already have four ties?
- I don't want to wear it.
- Why then did you buy it?
- To exchange it.
- To exchange it?   - Yes!
No.
No no no no.
- That one doesn't fit either.
- For what suit do you want the tie?
For my good Sunday afternoon promenading
suit of course.  - How does it look like?
- Great! Head to toe!
- I mean, what color?
Well, it hasn't got a real color...
- it's more like... grey.
- What kind of grey?
Some... greyish grey.
- Light or dark?
- Me? Always light.
- So, wine-red!
- No, not wine... beer!
Very funny.
I meant the suit.
Well, it isn't wine-red.
It's light grey.
Yes I know...
But to a wine-red...
To a light grey suit
fits only a wine-red tie.
That's a matter of taste. That's
too dark. The suit ain't  light.
- And that?
- That's too light!
Then I have an excellent
suggestion for you:
- You best come by with the suit
yourself.    - No, that won't work!
I'm wearing the suit only on Sunday,
and on Sunday you're closed!
But now let  make a suggestion:
- On Sunday you come to me!
- What?!
Well, I meant we could
meet on Sunday sometime!
Together we could go
to Sagebiel's, out at Blankenese,
and then I could show you
my new suit in motion, eh?
- How about it?   - I think
you should better go home now.
- But I've still got so much time!
- But I don't.
So, as agreed, next Sunday afternoon
I'll be waiting before your house.
That's typical Hamburg crap weather...
and it won't get any better today.
It doesn't matter, Hannes.
Today of all days, when I wanted
to show you the harbor...
What happened to the curtains, eh?
- Are they new?
- Yes, they're new.
Well I...
And the tablecloth...
haven't seen it before either!
- That's new, too!
- Say, did  buy all this?
Yes - do you like it?
- Paloma, where did you get the money?
- I had saved a bit...
You must be a bit batty, girl!
Spending your little dough for me?
No way!
But you bought the bed for me.
But that's a different matter!
You couldn't sleep on the sofa
huddled like a little doggie forever!
- And the bed was dirt cheap.
- The cloth was really cheap, too.
- And I sewed it myself.
- Downstairs at Mrs. Börgel's?
No, at the Wellenkamps,
at the store.
Mrs. Wellenkamp lent me her
sewing machine, as we don't have one.
You get along quite well with Carl
and his wife, eh?   - Oh yes.
And how about the customers?
How do you get on with the guys?
Well, they're a bit fresh at times...
but I can deal with them.
Do your parents also live here?
They're long dead....
Father remained on sea,
and then mother also
didn't live much longer.
- Were you more children at home?
- No. Except me only little Jan.
You Krögers were all seamen, right?
Tcha... guess it has to be...
So you're actually the only one
who didn't go to sea?
What the...
Now there's a thing!
- What gave you that idea?
- Well I thought you're a musician?
- Musician?    - Well, or
an entertainer or something...
I'm a sailor, dammit!
- Yes I know...   - I'm...
...you perform in a sailor costume,
but I thought...
A sailor's what I am, goddammit,
I'm a sailor,
all my rags are still here, over there!
And if I wanted to sign up
I could sign up tomorrow,
but... I don't want to!
But I couldn't have
guessed that, Hannes!
"Entertainer"... that's
a fine taradiddle...
For 18 years I've been to sea -
I can prove it anytime!
Where do you think I got that jacket,
at the fish market?
Here... here's all my papers!
It's all in it, where I've been...
Seamen's muster book.
Here, Hannes Kröger.
First voyage as deckhand, as ship's boy.
Bark Elisabeth from Hamburg
to Valparaiso, and back to Glasgow.
And here, ordinary seaman.
Full-rigged ship Borkholm, a Norwegian.
From Rotterdamn to Seaguard
and back to Bordeaux.
And here from Bremen to... Frisco.
And now all the trips as
able-bodied seaman on the Padua.
From Hamburg to Port Victorioa und back
and so on and so on and so on...
And all without any complaints -
take away that crap!
And here's still all my stuff,
all the things I've...
Well, here... last voyage...
my sailing gear... here...
my boots... a knife...
- What's that, it's full of moths!
- Too bad about the fine buscherump...
- That's a ?
- And what's that... oh...
- What's that?   - Huh?
- What is it?  - Oh, that's, uh...
- Let me see!   - That's just...
that's a few... that's...
cartographic... postcards...
specialties.
Ohh...
It's beautiful!
- For what bride did you bring it along?
- Oh... no particular...
- Would you like to have it?
- But I really cannot accept this!
Are these real corals?
Sure!
Straight from the South Seas!
Has already seen a good part
of the world, the old accordion...
- Is that difficult?
- No... not if you can.
Wanna try?
Come here... So...
In here, and here,
leave the fingers and thumbs outside.
Now just play...
Bravo bravo!
What's the name of the song?
- Show me again correctly, Hannes...
- Come here...
So, let go... so, out,
here, and over there...
You dance quite well, girl!
My longing carries me away
into the blue distance...
Why actually didn't you
stay on sea, Hannes?
You don't understand that, girl.
I'm sorry, Hannes.
I didn't want to hurt you.
Please play something cheerful...!
- No I can't - have to go to my joint!
- But you've got another hour!
Not today, today I
have to be there earlier.
- What are you doing tonight?
- I still have to darn a lot...
Yeah...?
Say... do you sometimes
listen to the radio?
- Yes, on and off...
- Well then do so today too.
Why? Anything special today?
Not really...
It's just... tonight I will
perform something on the radio.
In our program "On the Reeperbahn at
half past midnight, a tour of St. Pauli"
we've now arrived at the
Hippodrom at the Great Freedom,
the venue known to all seafaring
people around the world,
where the sailor finds relaxation
after a long journey and hard work.
Now Hannes Kröger, the singing sailor,
enters the podium above the arena.
The noise fades,
and now it resounds,
the old tune, well-known
on all seas, .
A wind from the south
draws me out to the sea!
My love, don't be sad
even though parting hurts.
My heart goes aboard
and onward the journey goes.
Your pain will go by
and the reunion will be fine!
My longing carries me away
into the blue distance.
Below me the sea
and above me night and stars.
Ahead of me the world,
carried by the wind of life,
don't cry my dear,
those tears, they're all in vain.
La Paloma ohe -
once it has to be over!
Only memories of hours of love
will still remain on shore.
My bride is the sea,
only to her I can be faithful.
When the storm wind sings its song
I'm called by...
At that weather you had
to wear the good gray suit?
How blue is the sea,
how big can be the skies!
High up from the crow's nest
I look far into the world.
If I only knew what's
the matter with Hannes!
Yes... he sings so different today!
So... entirely different!
Cape Horn is at lee side,
we now have to put trust in God.
Something's wrong!
Sailor, take care,
for even, as if a greeting of peace...
Yes, that's your own fault...
You just put up
with far too much from him!
Look at how I deal with Jens...
he does what I want, not vice versa.
For you that's
something quite different ...
you do not love Jens!
Sooner or later
the bell tolls for each of us.
Sailor's bride is the sea,
only to her he can be faithful
When the storm wind sings its song
I'm called by...
- What are you looking for, Hannes?
- Where did you hide away the Padua?
- The Padua?   - Yes, my gift from Jens
and Fiete... the ship in a bottle!
There it is...
Why do you hide it, Anita?
If I don't want to stay here,
then I won't stay here anyway.
What's the matter
with you anyway, Hannes?
For days you're so... different.
In the long run this makes me crazy,
every day the same racket in this dive,
always acting the fool...
Hannes Kröger, the singing sailor,
yeah, shit...
what actually am I here,
I'm a better entertainer clown,
that's what I am!
Hannes, what makes you think
like that all of a sudden?
You always wanted
to be your own master!
- own... own master!
- But that's what you are!  - Ah, yeah?
You no longer have to slave
on sea in all weathers for others
You have everything you need,
your food, to drink, you have money...
...you've got me...
There's still other things.
I see...
...that other
is probably  other!
Ah...
I tell you, once you drift rudderless
you will soon be stranded.
And no emergency tug
will get you back on course.
But what's that gloomy brooding,
for a guy as you!
The Great Freedom has worn me out,
finished, I'm a wreck!
You're crazy! Talking like that
may be excusable for someone like me,
for whom the Great Pilot
can come on board every day now...
but you, you still can sail clear!
"Sail clear"...
that's quite easy to say...
I've become a stinkin' landlubber,
I'm already tied up ashore far too close!
Then cut the cables, kid,
before it is too late!
Or you will end up like me...
Back to sea... just now...
when I'm for the first time...
Yeah - I am!
But then you don't have
to go back to sea!
Buy yourselves a barge
and do harbor tours!
- A barge?
- Yes!
A barge...
He's what?
He is sick ?
Yes, he's sick.
- The ass is sick?
- Now that's a fine joint...
The guests get beaten up,
the entertainer disappears,
and the main attraction is sick.
When I think of Cologne...
Hi Werner!
Willem, what about it?
Come along to Vierlanden on Sunday?
Sunday? No!
For Sunday I have better plans!
Mrs. Börgel told me to come down to
the barge stand to my friend Puhlmann.
Even the weather plays along today!
- Where are we going?    - I'll show
you the best place on the Elbe river.
We'll travel down to Blankenese
with the green steamer.
For me and my girl
is the best in the world
when we're going up the Elbe
on a green steamboat...
- Maybe we could go to Sagebiel, go
dancing?   - How do you know Sagebiel?
Lately some cheeky guy in the store
said he wanted to take me there.
Good that I wasn't around!
Puhlmann!
Where's the fire?
Can't you help me out
of the dilemma for a moment?
Konrad let me down and now I don't
have a barge guide for the Germania.
Couldn't you do at least one tour?
On this occasion I could show you
the harbor - what do you think?
That's fine by me, Hannes -
Sagebiel won't run away!
I'm coming!
Me too!
Ahead of us is the ...
The clock you see up there
is no clock...
that's a water-level indicator...
and the fat round ball you see on top
of the tower, now that's the clock!
That's the , or as
we say in Hamburg, the .
That's the clock of the sailor.
You can't carry it around
in your pocket.
Now ain't this something...
Over there, ladies, is the biggest
powder factory in all of Germany.
So we better not get too close, eh?
That's Dr. Oetker's
baking powder factory!
Damned critters...
yeah... peep peep!
Yes ladies and gentlemen,
these are the perils of seafaring!
It can't be helped...
So how do you like my new suit?
So entirely without a tie it doesn't
look like much of course but...
The steamer in front over there
is just unloading.
- Is it on fire?
- Of course not, Miss...
if it were on fire
it couldn't unload!
It unloads Jamaica rum...
With me it's quite the opposite:
I've got a terrible thirst
and nothing to quench it!
- Did you say something?
- No.
You said "No"!
Terrific! I already
thought you lost your voice!
- Can you also say "Yes"?
- You're pretty cheeky!
Oh I know...
my acquaintances always say
that I'm as cheeky as
the seagulls at Lombard Bridge.
And now our enchanted glance goes to...
...the limit!
That beats everything!
I mean, this is the highlight
of our harbor tour...
What you will see now
is the sailing ship harbour.
Here a spectacular sight meets our eyes.
This is the last sailing ship
based in Hamburg,
the four masted barque Padua
of the shipping company F. Laeisz.
On this proud ship I myself
did travel for many a year,
no, for many decades as a sailor!
- He's lying!
- Barmbeck landlubber, bugger off!
The last trip from Australia
to Hamburg, the Padua went
in the record time of 68... days ...
Will you next Sunday again have an
appointment with your distant relative?
Probably!
In any case, next Sunday afternoon at 3
I'll be waiting at your door again.
Without tie?
Perhaps the gentlemen back there
would also deign to listen?
I don't want to blather
my yap to frinches here for nothing!
Hey hey hey hey hey...!
Over there at Pinnersberg is the
most important building of Hamburg...
that's where I live.
Over there's the wharf of Blohm & Voss!
The biggest German ships are built there.
Every real Hamburger knows
the song of the workers of Blohm & Voss:
we're working over there
at Blohm 'n Voss
merry as larks
and always proper
we chew tobacco
and have dreadful thirst.
On Sunday dressed up
in our glad rags
Hold your horses,
we're no choral society, eh!
Now wait, pal...
Would you please change from
starboard to portside for a moment?
I'll do a little turn now and then...
then you can have another look
at the marvelous harbor panorama!
- How do you know the song so well?
- I'm working at Blohn & Voss!
- What - you're not a sailor?
- Me? No!
That's not for me.
Gisa! Come over here, eh!
Next Sunday you're  going
to wear the good grey suit again!
Even more so! Next Sunday
I'll go dancing, at Sagebiel's!
- Do you have a new bride?
- Not yet, Mrs. Kaasbohm,
not yet! But next Sunday!
Next Sunday for sure,
but this Sunday it's impossible!
I was so looking forward to Sagebiel -
I wasn't out dancing for so long.
Sagebiel won't run away.
I have a meeting today,
that's very important for me,
and perhaps not only for me...
for litte Paloma...
Cheers!
What's the matter? It's our last Sunday
and you ask us to come to Puhlmann?
I rather wanted to see what Margot's doing
and if she has no other plans have a
little farewell celebration with her!
I'm doing a test drive and I want you
to take a look at the barge - let's go!
- Hey, where are you?
- You want to  the barge?
Perhaps...!
I don't believe it!
He's going to stay ashore?!
- You really dance terrific!
- Always depends on the man, how he leads!
- I think we go together just great.
- You think so?
Yes. When I have you in my arm
your height is according to regulations.
- Is that necessary?
- Yes, that's necessary.
What's that?
What...
Shall we make it cackle?
Looks like you can't
go past any slot machine...
- It's a pity about the money.
- Yes, Mrs. Kaasbohm says that too.
Now come...
- May I?
- Thank you!
- Who is Mrs. Kaasbohm?
- Mrs. Kaasbohm, that's my landlady.
Don't you want to get to know her?
No?
- He still hasn't brought the ice?
- It's always mighty busy here on Sunday.
I guess you're here every Sunday?
No. Just once in a while.
- Why don't we drink a glass together?
- Better not. I get tipsy too easily.
Don't worry... I'll take you  home.
- "You "?
- Right...
I knew it all the time,
we forgot something...
We have to catch up on this right away -
to drink to close friendship.
You  better stick with "Mrs. Gisa",
and I with Mr...
What's your ...
What's your  name, anyway?
See?... that's what happens!
So what's it to be?
?
You  please.
Now... my name's Georg Wilhelm Scholz.
And I'm Gisela Marie Sophie Häuptlein.
Is that necessary?
But that's the main point!
Think about it calmly
and let me know.
About the price we will
surely come to an agreement.
All right, Fritz!
Hello... well, guys?
Day after tomorrow
the Padua goes to sea again.
Have you signed on already?
- Tcha, it has to go on...
- Well... now that the ass is sick...
- Poor Margot.
- When will you kick off?
At 7.
Say, Hannes...
There's something the matter with you.
It sticks out a mile!
- What's the girl's name?
- What girl?
Oh, come on - when a fellow as you
lets down his pal at the Hippodrom
- and still doesn't go to sea...
- and drives 'round the habor in a launch...
There's for sure some
long-haired female behind it!
Oh now don't talk
such muddled nonsense.
Eh, Hannes - clear deck:
You want to marry, right?
Maybe... yes...
if she wants me...
- What... you didn't ask her yet?
- No...
This time it's all much different.
Who... who is it?
Do we know her?
No, she's from out of town!
When is she coming?
"Coming"... she already lives with me!
Man eh....
He's a sly old dog, eh?
No, not what you think,
wham-bam, thank you ma'am,
free concert on the City Hall market...
Paloma, she's much different...
- What's the girl's name?
- Well, Gisa!
But you just said "Paloma"...
You need something
to wash your ears, Jens!
How... does Gisa look like?
- Is she pretty?
- Sure...!
And homely and busy
and accurate and...
and all...
and a respectable girl, too.
I didn't believe
something like that still existed.
Boy oh boy oh boy...
- Tcha, in that case...
- Pity, isn't it?
Pity, that we now...
won't get to know your Paloma!
- Why?   - Day after tomorrow
we'll be already back at sea...
- Wanna see her?
- Sure!   - Yes, man!
- Here goes! Come along!
- Yeah!
Go ahead!
But first wipe your kicks!
Gisa! I bring visitors!
Don't be shy!
Gisa!
Sit down!
Gisa!
Where are you, girl?
Gisa!
Aren't you here?
Well...
Oh...
She's probably away
for a moment...
That's for you only...
"The meal's in the caboose
on the tray.
Since you didn't come back
I went for a walk with a friend."
"How about Sagebiel?
I'm waiting downstairs -
- What are you blabbering?
- That's on the other side.
White dove... gone!
Sagebiel...
Shall we go?
Yes.
- Waiter, the bill please...
- Colleague coming up!
Well...
You...?
Is it allowed...?
Hannes...!
No!
Come sit down.
- I didn't ask you!
- Waiter, the bill please!
- I was about to leave...
- What did the gentlemen have?
- Well we had...
- What did you have?  - One cake...
What's at this table is on me!
Perhaps the gentlemen
settle this first.
Hello, gentlemen,
I still get 6 mark 20!
Now come along...
Gisa - if you need me:
I live at Steckelhörn 3.
- How do you know that bloke anyway?
- From the store.   - Ah!
- And he's not a bloke but a very
decent person.   - A windbag he is!
Oh, you've already met more often?
- No!    - Yeah?
And last Sunday at the barge
it was just pure coincidence!
As for my part for sure!
- Don't tell me lies, girl!
- Stop yelling!
Not everybody needs to hear this!
They're already talking about us anyway!
They should better care
about their own shit!
What's between us
is no one else's business!
You didn' even turn off the radio!
You seem to have been
in a great hurry!
What the...
- There you are, Hannes!
- What are  doing here?
I was caught in the rain nearby...
Luckily, I had the keys with me.
G'day, Miss!
God, you're drenched!
Well that's Miss Häuptlein,
a distant relative of mine.
- And this is...
- Anita Schröder is my name.
Yeah... that's my boss.
One might also say so...
And now get changed quickly!
Or you'll catch a cold!
Can't have that with my entertainer!
- I'll make us a nice coffee.
- But I can do that!
Never mind, Miss,
after all I'm here at home.
Jens told me various things -
for how long has this been going with her?
Gisa? That was the bride of my brother!
Ah, and now you took her over -
stays in the family, eh?
Get the hell out of here, babe, eh!
you still think
you will never get over it...
Where are my grey stockings?
I darned them and
put them in your wardrobe.
- Put on stockings, honey!
- Yes!
Now, now!
He's also one
you have take as he is.
- Are you with him for a long time?
- I'm in Hamburg for only a month.
In the beginning
he's always very likable.
Later it will
sort itself out, unfortunately.
You have a nice figure...
But sailors are hard to keep.
Hannes doesn't want to have
anything more to do with the sea.
Dogs, that bark a lot...
one day he'll sign on again anyway.
I know the guys.
Or do you perhaps think
he'll marry you?
You think because he didn't marry you?
Me, marrying such a bloke?
Hannes is not a bloke.
He's a decent person...
a very decent person.
He knows exactly what he's doing.
Just like me.
Your water's boiling...
how much hotter do you want it?
Earlier... on the stairs,
I guess I was a bit...
a bit loud towards you... Paloma?
"A bit" is good...
You have to understand this, girl...
I have my reasons for it.
And now all the more,
since I know, that you...
Help me with my buttons
please, will you?
Now I really have to say: The
apartment is in immaculate good shape.
New tableware, new curtains,
and the tablecloth's also new to me.
But as you now live here permanently.
And I just dropped by for short chat.
But it was nice anyway, Hannes, no?
Now let's talk about something else!
Just leave it to draw a little bit more.
Have you ever heared our Hannes sing?
- Yes, on the radio.
- God, on the radio... that's nothing.
You have to hear him at the Hippodrom,
you will not recognize him!
He does not want me to go there.
But why not, Hannes,
my venue is not a dive?!
I also have very good guests,
they all come because of Hannes.
- Especially the ladies.
- Now stop talking such rubbish!
Oh come on, Hannes...
the Consul's wife for example!
She's there only because of you...
in fact she's totally crazy about him.
She wants to take him to
the Hansa Theater by all means.
Will we now have coffee or not?
I don't want no coffee,
Mrs. Kassbohm!
You don't want any coffee,
you don't want to eat,
probably didn't work out
with the new bride, eh?
- Leave me alone! I have to go!
- At that weather?
Do you want to ruin the blue suit
just as that one?
- What are you up to?
- Have to kick someone out of his suit!
you still think
you will never get over it,
Gimme the trumpet!
- Here he's in his element!
- He looks totally changed.
I tell you, Hannes belongs to
the Great Freedom and nowhere else.
Her first, he was a sailor
who was tattooed on his chest.
Over there,
that's the Consul's wife.
He wore ocean blue trousers
and she was so terribly shy.
- Evening!
- Evening, Fiete!
- Ah, a new one?
- That's Miss Gisa.
Oh, that's you?
Brinkmann... Fiete Brinkmann
is my name...
Jens and me, we're
old friends of Hannes!
Jens - what do you think of her?
Kill 'er...
just kill 'er!
- Whom?
- Over there!
- What's your name?
- Hein Olsen.
Hein? Oh, now that's
a beautiful name, isn't it?
Tcha!
When did you sign off, eh?
If he gets intimate
I'll kill him!
After Hannes has finished
I will show you the ass ride!
- Ass ride? Are here any asses?
- More than enough.
- Where's Bimbo?
- In his stable. Can't walk.
- Too bad, isn't it?
- He still can't walk?
He needs a kick in the ass!
To be faithful, he said, I can try it,
though I've never been faithful before.
If it's a boy, call him Johnny,
if it's a girl, call her Mary.
He did not come to the wedding,
at the baptism, he was not there
Oh, I see...
Don't laugh,
it happens in the best families!
All sing along! Ballet!
Why don't you say hello?
Could be inconvenient for your bloke.
- What's the matter?
- Leave me alone!
Hannes!
That does it!
Excuse me, I didn't mean you!
Get out of here, this is
no place for you any more, okay?
But what... what's that to you?
I mean...
Sorry, but I didn't mean you!
Don't touch me, okay?
That ape!
Don't touch me!
- We'll talk later!
- You bet!
Too bad you're mother
will not recognize you!
All mouth and no trousers!
'Cause your nose will sit
on the back of your neck!
And your nose...
flies from your face!
Police!
Come along, gentlemen!
Tearing off my bow-tie, eh?
When did you sign off?
Wait a minute!
Allleeee...
...let them have it!
What happened, Kröger?
- Internal family celebration,
officer...    - Yeah...
Tcha... better take care that
it doesn't become a private function!
Will you finally
leave the girl alone?
Your bitch can get lost, pal... who
wants a floosie of the Great Feedom!
Ah you... you bumpkin!
Are you asleep, Gisa?
No...
If you just hadn't come
to the Hippodrom tonight...
I have no idea why suddenly there
was such a wild clobbering under way.
But perhaps it all had to be...
now I know at least
where I'm at with that guy.
It's easy to drag a respectable
girl through the mud...
- What did he?
- He thinks you're one of the streets!
No...!
"A floosie of the
Great Freedom" he said.
You don't have to be upset about
what such an idiot says,
it doesn't matter to you.
What's that strange guy
to you anyway, girl...
you've got me!
The last few days I already
wanted to talk to you about it...
I'm leaving the Great Freedom,
in the long run that's no life.
With Anita, that's not
was it used to be,
and the other women...
it comes and goes, the way it is,
after all ...
after all one's a man.
The Consul's wife...
she wanted to get me to the
Hansa Theater by all means, but...
it's better that way.
And if you hadn't come
I would've gone back to sea anyway,
it's still more powerful
than one would think.
Then comes the death of my brother...
and then you...
and then everything is different.
"Sail clear" said the Admiral, Gisa...
I will buy the barge,
you can count on that...
and then you will see
how light and blue the sky will be...
and then...
we put my stuff
and your stuff together
and then getting married...
There's a nice saying
on merchant ships:
Fine weather and a good trip...
tomorrow again...
Hansa Theater!
Hansa Theater!
Hansa Theater!
Hansa Theater!
Hansa Theater!
Hansa Theater!
Come to sea again!
Stay with me!
You will not be a Mate!
Sail clear!
Come to sea again!
Stay with me!
You will be no Mate!
Sail clear!
- Come to sea...! - Stay...!
- Sail clear...!
Hannes!
Hannes!
Have no fear, Paloma...
I'll stay with you!
Paloma...
Steckelhörn 3!
Paloma...
Paloma!
Steckelhörn 3!
Steckelhörn 3!
Paloma...
Steckelhörn 3!
What's the matter, Hannes?
Nothing... nothing at all...
I was just dreaming...
Go back to sleep, Gisa!
Everything will be... all right...
Eh, Jens...
one thing I can tell you, man...
Our Hannes is lost for seafaring.
What love can do to an man...
I'm glad we're at sea again tomorrow.
Hey Jens, Fiete, it's almost 7
and you're not yet ready!
- I'll stay on board.
- You're both mad.
I want to stay in Hamburg forever.
Hamburg is the most beautiful city of
the world, not even Cologne can compete.
I'm sick and tired of Hamburg.
Owww....
Come, go ahead, get in!
and put it down there... so...
You... you couldn't find
any higher place to live?
You better be glad
that I'm no lighthouse keeper!
What's going on here?
Anyone's birthday?
Don't be so inquisitive, Mrs. Börgel...
Come here... here's 50 mark...
- There's nothing wrong in asking, no?
- Now don't stand around here...
better go to the kitchen,
Gisa will be here any moment!
Well good night, Mr. Wellenkamp,
I will unpack the new buscherumps
tomorrow, all right?
It's all right, girl,
there's no hurry.
But you better go now -
for sure he's already waiting!
For me no one is waiting...
Say, Mr. Wellenkamp...
where's that... Steckelhörnstreet?
A young lady is here...
she wants to see you.
- What young lady?
- I don't know her.
She hasn't been here before.
- Don't you want to put on
at least a little bit?    - Why?
What are  doing here?
I have to tell you something.
Yes? Please?
you're not handsome,
but you've got charme...
So...
you kiss them all
and never remain faithful...
Huh?
How can one marry in house
with such narrow doors?
Yes...
And I really thought
you had something going with him.
Then I wouldn't have come - no?
No.
I guess you haven't had
anything to eat yet, right?
Then... then I'll...
wait a moment.
Mrs. Kaasbohm?
Oh couldn't we have some more tea,
please, Mother Kaasbohm?
- Is this the new bride, from Sunday?
- Do you like her?
Beats me!
Young man...
Lil' one...
Hello... hello,
stay here, eh!
Carl Wellenkamp,
The House for the Sailor...
No, Hannes, she left here
at seven prompt.
Now what could have happened.
She's no small child anymore.
She probably has to do some shopping...
...I'm sure!
She asked me about the Steckelhörn!
What's the matter, Mr. Kröger?
Nothing...
Nothing at all...
WHO DARES WINS
When did it start for you?
Well... wait...
- Actually, already at the Bajazzo...
- What Bajazzo?
The gambling machine!
- At Mrs. Börgel, downstairs
at your place!  - Yes...
Don't you remember... back then...
when you shoved me?
I couldn't stand you then...
you were so cheeky!
And when did it start for you?
- Also at a slot machine...
- But you just said...
No - not at Mrs. Börgel's...
- At Blankenese...
- I see...
Never let it be said
that slot machines were no good.
Say that again...!
But I can say it only once...
- But I want to hear it once more...
- But I won't say it!
That's pretty!
Where did you get the necklace?
It's from...
from the South Sea.
Ah...
- I'll find me a room tomorrow.
- But nearby, okay?
I'm afraid of tomorrow anyway.
Why that?
Do you think I don't know you
anymore tomorrow?     - No.
No... it's just because of...
Maybe it will hurt him.
Why? You didn't have
anything going with him!
No, it's not that...
But he was so different
in the last few days...
Sometimes I almost had the feeling...
I had that feeling from the start.
- He never said anything, but...
- See?
Then you don't need
to have a bad conscience.
- I just feel so ungrateful.
- But why...?
You looked after for him all those weeks!
Seems to be mighty hard for you, eh?
Don't talk such nonsense...
Wait... I've got something for you!
- You always wanted to exchange
your tie!     - Too late!
That suit is ruined.
Do you perhaps think
I'm dependent on her?
Whether you think
that I'm dependent on her, eh?
I'm not dependent on her!
Bye.
- Where do you want to go?
- To Margot.   - Come here!
Come in!
Get out of here, you...!
Get out!
What's the matter with you?
Leave me alone...
- What's with Hannes?
- Shut up!
There...
Engagement rings...
Hannes...
Never mind...
You have to get out of here.
Don't you want
to join up with us again?
But aren't you...
already complete?
- No, we're not!  - No?
- Well, Karl! from Cologne...
He'd like to stay here,
he likes Hamburg a lot,
- if he finds a replacement.
- All of a sudden?
- How come?
- Oh...
...old story.
Ah... because of a woman.
No...
- No.   - The captain has a telephone,
I could get it straight quickly!
Back to sea...
At sea again...
Good evening, dad!
Jens!
What's wrong with you?
I cannot forget Margot.
Have you lost your marbles, eh?
You're crying... because of a woman?
Let her go!
Hey, tomorrow...
you will be on sea again and then
everything will look different!
You...
And when you're standing
up there on the yard again,
and the wind howls
in your ears up there, eh!
then you'll forget everything...
Jens, don't you remember
what our captain back then
wrote into our fleet calendar
for christmas?
"One wouldn't believe
what a man can forget...
...if he's a man"?
And when you come home again
after such a long voyage,
then perhaps you no longer know
how she looked like... or...
...you find another.
If you want.
Jens, sing along, eh!
Two, three -
oh how glorious
are you standing there.
City of Hamburg,
at the Elbe's meadows
-
- Hannes, here's the kitbag...
- Mrs. Börgel's got the keys
to your place.    - Fine.
What the...
- Hannes goes to sea again?
- Sure, dude! On our Padua!
- In place of Karl! The captain agreed!
- Hannes!
Sure, Anita...
once it has to be again...
now don't cry my girl, come...
come, give me a kiss...
you were... sure enough
not too bad...
Well...
...so let's go.
Fine weather...
and a good trip, lad!
