It could be
tomorrow or it could be today
When the sky takes the soul
The earth takes the clay
It could be tomorrow
or it could be today
When the sky takes the soul
The earth takes the clay
It could be tomorrow
or it could be today
When the sky takes the soul
The earth takes the clay
It could be tomorrow
or it could be today
When the sky takes the soul
The earth takes the clay
Or a half-tonne bomb
In the back of the truck
I think we just
went over something.
There's something
caught in the tracks.
What's going on?
I think the lead vehicle's
got a mechanical.
See if you can reach it.
If it's tomorrow or if it's today
I don't say it will be
I just say it may
When I'm on my knees
To the gates I'll stumble
And plead my case
In a style that's humble
It could be tomorrow
or it could be today
When the sky takes the soul
The earth takes the clay
It could be tomorrow
or it could be today
When the sky takes the soul
The earth takes the clay
It could be tomorrow
or it could be today
When the sky takes the soul
The earth takes the clay
It could be tomorrow
or it could be today
Smell that, Davy?
That's the future.
That's the brewery.
- What's up wi' you?
It always feels weird coming back,
especially without Ronnie.
We'll see Ronnie soon enough.
We're home, Davy.
We've gotta enjoy it.
Have you thought about
what you're gonna do now that we're out?
Aye, loads.
Most of it involves your sister.
- Ally, don't go getting carried away.
- I'm not getting carried away.
You can't just expect her
to drop everything.
- That's exactly what I expect her to do.
- Hey, right?
- Something smells good.
- Did you get bread?
Yeah.
I'm on my way
from misery to happiness today
- Uh-huh
- Uh-huh
I'm on my way
from misery to happiness today
- Uh-huh
- Uh-huh
And years from now
I'll make it to the next world
And everything
that I receive up yonder
Is what she gave to me
the day I wandered
I took a right
I took a right a-turning yesterday
- Uh-huh
- Uh-huh
I took a right
I took a right a-turning yesterday
We took the road
that brought us to our home town
We took the train
to streets that we could walk down
We walked the streets
to find the one we've looked for
We climbed the stairs
that led us to the front door
And now that I don't
want for anything
'...I'm sitting on
top of the world!'
- Mum, have you seen my keys?
- No.
- There's soup there. You want some?
- I haven't got time.
You cannae go to work
on an empty stomach, Liz.
- Mum, I'm late.
- Try getting up a bit earlier.
- Can you not, Dad?
- Here.
I'm sitting on top of the world
-  Oh, my God!
-  Davy.
What were you doing?
I can't believe you didn't tell me.
Are you good?
We weren't expecting you
till tomorrow.
They let us go early.
We thought we'd surprise you.
- I was worried you'd be working.
- I am. I'm just out the door.
I'm on lates this week.
Sorry.
Hey, son.
- Good to see you.
- You too, son, you too.
- You hungry?
- Aye.
- Sit down.
- Welcome home, Davy.
- Thank you.
- Walk me to my bus.
- OK.
- Come on.
- I'll see you later, Mrs Henshaw.
- See you later, Ally.
Good to have you both back.
Come here.
Oh, Mum.
So, you can let your
hair grow again.
- I suppose I could, aye.
- There's nothing stopping you now.
The world's your oyster.
I hate oysters.
It's just snot in a shell.
Right, I've got to go.
See you.
I'm not ready.
I had everything planned for the morn.
Ma, it's all right.
I even got this to put up.
Steak pie.
I got a steak pie.
It's still in the freezer.
It's never gonna defrost in time.
I was sorry to hear about Ronnie.
Could have been me, Dad.
Maybe should have been.
It was my squad.
It was my responsibility.
It was a roadside bomb. There was
nothing you could do about that.
It's good to have you home.
Look at you, my wee brother,
the war hero.
Is this all right?
You did say.
I'm gonna get back to work.
- See you later.
- Great.
We'll put wee Lewis in with Carol Ann.
You can share with Brendan.
Don't worry. It won't be for long.
- Kids'll love it, won't youse?
Yep.
Having your Uncle Ally
to stay for a wee while.
Yeah.
- Are you a soldier?
- I am, yes.
- You look fabulous.
- That's very kind of you. Thanks.
You're welcome.
- Hey.
- Where have you been?
All right, grumpy.
Well, Ally and Davy turned up.
- Really?
- Yeah. They got away early.
Ally's just got back after
six months and you're here?
Well, it's my job.
You'd do the same.
Yeah, chance'd be a fine thing.
- You still coming to Francine's do?
- Yeah, you know I am.
Good. Very good.
- Don't start.
- What?
- Trying to set me up again.
- Come on. He wasn't that bad.
Yeah, he was. He was weird.
He was a Scientologist.
Well, I thought that meant
he worked in a lab.
Came from one more like.
- Ally, did you ever shoot anybody?
- What?
Did you ever shoot anybody, Ally?
Am I on the top bunk?
I'm afraid you're on the bottom bunk.
I'm no use for it.
OK.
- Hiya, Harry.
- Oh, Jean.
Big day today,
what with Davy coming back.
He's already here. My boy's home.
He got away early.
- That's lovely. You must be pleased.
- Aye.
Right.
Oh, Jean, maybe we could
meet at lunch, have a wee...
- See you, Harry.
- ...celebration.
- Morning, girls.
- Jean.
I've got some great news.
Straight through
to the Scottish Colourists.
I'm sure your brother's lovely.
I'm just not up for small talk.
I wouldn't worry about it.
He's not very chatty either.
I've had a crap day and all I want
is a drink and a laugh.
Yeah, and a drink and a laugh
is all it is.
Now, you can talk or not.
He's not gonna be listening.
He's just gonna be
staring at your tits.
I'm not staying long.
One drink then I'm off.
Well, don't tell me.
Tell your sister.
She wants you to meet her pal.
Another nutcase
from the nurses' home?
- This one's different apparently.
- Different? How?
Well, she's good-looking.
She stays out in Morningside.
She's English.
English?
That's for you.
You celebrating something?
No, just fancy getting drunk.
The thing with tequila, it's not what
you forget, it's what you remember.
- Francine.
- No wonder you're still single.
- Fran.
- Oh, thanks. Cheers, my dears.
- You in?
- I'm in.
Good.
That's boggin'.
Right, Lizzie, up.
Tell us one of your stories.
- OK.
- Drunken storytelling?
- No one's safe.
- OK.
This is the
story of our first teacher
You remember?
Threw up her hands
when our mums said our names
- I've never seen her do this ever.
- You've never seen her do this?
Embroidered all her stories
with slanderous claims
Whoa!
It's over and done with
It's over and done with
Right, I'm
getting more drinks.
It's over and done with
It's over and done with
It's over and done with
It's over and done with
- Right, you, come on.
- I'll gi' youse a story, aye.
Nice one.
This is the story of
losing my virginity
I held my breath
and the bed held a trinity
People, I'm making no claims
to no mystery
But sometimes I feel like
my sex life's all history
It's over and done with
It's over and done with
It's over and done with
It's over and done with
It's over and done with
It's over and done with
It's over and done with
It's over and done with
I'm not saying these events
didn't touch our lives in any way
They didn't leave the impression
that some people say
- Get over it, Liz.
- Yvonne, you get up. It's your turn.
- I can't. What am I gonna say?
- You'll be fine.
Just tell us anything.
Come on, everybody gets a turn.
This is the story
of watching a man dying
The subject's unpopular
but I don't feel like lying
When I think of it now
I acted like a sinner
I just washed my hands
and I went for my dinner
Washed my hands
and walked away.
It's over and done with
It's over and done with
It's over and done with
It's over and done with
It's over and done with
It's over and done with
Come here, you.
It's all right.

- It's over and done with...
- I cannae breathe!
It's over and done with
It's over and done with
Francine, what are you doing?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Don't let her do that to you.
It's over and done with
It's over and done with

It's over and done with

It's over and done with
It's over and done with
- Come on.
- What, you serious?
Well, it's better
than the bottom bunk.
The tequila helping?
No, not really.
OK.
I used to come up here a lot.
It works every time.
- How many girls is that, then?
- No, I mean it clears your head.
All right, so it's not
some weird pick-up technique.
What, midnight hill climbing?
Do you think that would work?
- No.
- No.
Well, you're here.
Must be the accent.
Sucker for a bit of the brogue.
Och aye? What accent's that, then?
Yeah, it's how I ended
up in Edinburgh.
Met a guy who could roll his Rs,
followed him north.
- What, you came all this way for love?
- I'd like to think so.
It didn't last, though.
Nearly put me off Scottish men for good.
How?
Well, if you asked him
what he felt about us,
then he literally
couldn't string two words together.
But if you drove through
somewhere like Glen Coe,
then he was singing folk songs
and crying like a baby.
Aye, that's fair enough.
I can understand why that would
ruin our reputation for you.
Yeah. I used to think it was
something in the water up here.
- Or the beer.
- It's not the beer.
No, it starts way before
you reach drinking age.
Yeah?
It's somewhere in between
puberty and the pub.
When the inspiration
is above our station
Thoughts are melancholy
and we let them pass
We tend to view this nation
through the condensation
If misty eyes can witness
I was going through some
of Mum's stuff and I found this.
Thought you might like it.
I remember when this was taken.
She left a few days after.
I know.
She got on the train.
I never saw her again.
Never heard from her.
She didn't write.
Didn't tell me about you.
Well, she said it wasn't meant to be
between you two.
I'm sorry.
I promise you, I do not wanna
cause you any trouble.
It's complicated, you know.
- 24 years ago.
- Yeah.
A long time.
Whenever you're ready, madam.
Thank you.
There's room in the car if you'd
like to come to the cemetery.
It wouldn't be a good idea.
Well, I am around for a while,
if you fancy a coffee?
Only if you want to.
It was good to meet you.
I'd just like to ask you a couple
of questions about your kitchen.
I'm sorry. Apologies, ma'am.
My name's Davy Henshaw.
I would like to speak to you
about kitchen appliances.
You all right, mate?
- Good you see you, mate.
- It's good to see you.
- Where's Ally?
- He couldn't make it.
His sister's got him watching
the kids after school or something.
It's all right.
You don't have to cover for him.
You know Ally. He took it hard.
No. No. That's all the more reason
for him to come and say hello, then.
- Aye.
- Some people can't handle it.
My wee mum's OK, but my dad,
he just bangs on about the weather.
What about you?
What are you doing with yourself?
- Are you working?
- Aye, in a call centre.
Bloody hell, man.
And I thought I had it bad.
- It's just temporary.
- I thought you'd be army for life.
It suited you, big guy.
So, how's Rona?
She's a woman.
Who knows?
I suppose she's just
trying to be brave.
I preferred it when she
used to just shout at me.
- Is there anything I can do?
- You came, Davy. That's plenty.
What you doing?
It's this silver wedding
anniversary list.
It's a wonder Mum's
put up with you that long.
I was a catch, I'll let you know.
Lucky she didn't
throw you back, then.
No, it wasn't luck.
We just clicked.
- We knew.
- How?
How d'you know there wasn't
someone else out there for you?
There was nobody else
out there for me, just your mum.
My dad, all about the dreams
and the romance.
I had my dreams.
I wanted your Mum,
I wanted kids,
I wanted Hibs to win the league.
- Is that all?
- Two out of three, not bad.
Right, I'm off.
See you later.
- Have a good night.
- See you, love.
- Don't forget your keys this time.
- Thanks, Dad. I'm not five anymore.
Davy's out tonight too.
Got the house to ourselves.
Come on, give us a cuddle.
I'm just thinking about
Mum and Dad's anniversary party.
You know, 25 years. Makes your head
spin a wee bit, doesn't it?
Yeah.
I've been thinking about
that kind of stuff myself.
You know, the future, 25 years.
You can actually see yourself
that far ahead?
Aye.
- Doing what?
- Well, all the usual stuff.
Working hard, bringing up a family.
Going to see Hibs.
Is that not what everybody wants?
You sound like my dad.
What's wrong with that?
We're doing OK, aren't we?
What?
What you on about?
'Course we are.
Daft.
I'd better go.
Please don't go
You never seem to know the time
- You never seem to know the time
- I never seem to know the time
- You never seem to know the time
- Please don't go
- You can tell it to the birds
- Rushing by
- You never seem to know the time
- Please don't go
- You can tell it to the birds
- Rushing by
Good night, Ally.
Give me a ring.
I should get my bus.
- We could get a cab.
- I can't afford a cab.
- We could split it.
- That's noble of you.
- I just wanna see you home safe.
- I have to get up early.
If we leave now,
you'll still get five hours.
Don't you mean six?
Five and a half, final offer.
Stay
Better get you home safe, then.
- Morningside, please, mate.
-  Morningside it is.
- Have you had a nice night, folks?
-  We've had a lovely night.
It's about to get a
whole lot better.
Now, five and half hours.
- Have you ever stayed up all night?
- No.
No? Why not try it?
All right, trouble?
Yeah.
Are you OK?
I'm out with Mum today.
- Yeah?
- And your lassie.
It's your big night.
You want to look good.
I'm just not sure
this place is me.
Well, where do you want to go?
I don't know.
Where do you normally go, Yvonne?
- Glasgow.
- That's a bit desperate.
It's a wonder you ever go anywhere.
- I've been to plenty places.
- What, like Spain?
Have you ever fancied seeing
somewhere a bit more exciting?
What, like Glasgow?
No, like China, or Brazil.
I nearly went to India once.
- Really?
- Yep.
Couple of lasses I knew from art school
bought themselves a camper van.
They were gonna drive there,
down through Europe,
then Turkey, into Iran,
Afghanistan, Pakistan.
They wanted me to go with them.
So why didn't you?
It would have been amazing.
Yeah, I thought about it.
I think I would have gone.
But I'd just met your dad.
You gave up the world for him.
That's so romantic.
Bloody tragic if you ask me.
Nobody's asking you.
Come on, let's get out of here.
Let's go to Top Shop.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
Thanks for coming.
- All right?
- Where have you been?
I was in town. There was
something I had to pick up.
- What's that?
- What?
Davy.
I'm gonna propose to Liz.
Bloody hell.
I thought I'd do it
at your folks' silver wedding do.
- Kind of appropriate, is it not?
- Yeah.
Why not? Just go for it.
- Bro.
- My man.
Congratulations. Are you going down
on one knee? What you gonna say?
Well, I hadn't thought about it.
I mean, something like...
- 'You know how I feel about you.'
- Aye.
'Do you wanna marry me?'
- You cannae say that.
- Why no, Bronco.
- You gotta keep it simple.
- There's simple.
- But that's just brutal.
- What are you talking about?
You gotta dress it up, man.
- Aye, you lay the ground a bit.
- What?
Look, I'm you, right?
- Davy's your missus.
- What?
Aye.
We've been going together
- Whoa, whoa. All right.
No way. I won't.
- Hey?
Have kids, grow old
and grey with you
- Let's get married
- You make each other happy
- Let's get married
- It's just a piece of paper
For the moments
when we think we can't go on
For the lives of the children
that we've planned
- Let's get married
- Come on, darling
When you're old if they ask me
How do I define success?
Well, I'll say you find a woman
and you fall in love
- Let's get married
- All right, you can have a cat
For the moments
when we think we can't go on
For the lives of the children
that we've planned
- Let's get married
- Come on, darling
Come on, darling
Please take my hand
Come on, darling
Please take my hand
Come on, darling
Please take my hand
Come on, darling
Please take my hand
Come on, darling
Please take my hand
Come on, darling
Please take my hand
Come on, darling
Please take my hand
Whoa!
All right, drinks are on the house.
I can't conceive
of the years left to me
I wanna thank everybody
for coming here today.
I know some of you
have travelled far
and we really appreciate the effort
you've made to get here.
I think we all know
who we're here to celebrate.
My beautiful wife, Jean.
25 years ago
a priest asked her that question,
and Jean had her answer ready.
After 25 years of marriage,
I can assure you
she always has an answer ready.
He's a bit slow. He'll learn.
But I really do wanna thank her
for taking a chance on me
all those years ago.
I've never been lucky
with girls, I confess
Don't know who to blame
for my lack of success
'Cause even the ones
at the back of a bus
There was always a risk
of a slap in the pus
First time I met her
it did cross my mind
Next time I saw her
I hadnae the time
Third time I saw her
I thought that I should
Fourth time I met her
I knew that I would
He loves her,
he loves her, he loves her
He loves her,
he loves her, he loves her
He wants you forever
He wants you for good
So he's gonna treat you
the way that he should
For your soul and body
My heart's gonnae pound
Even after the day
that I'm laid in the ground
He loves her,
he loves her, he loves her
He loves her,
he loves her, he loves her
- Jean, Oh, Jean
- Oh, Jean!
- Dad!
He loves her,
he loves her, he loves her
He loves her,
he loves her, he loves her
He loves her,
he loves her, he loves her
He loves her,
he loves her, he loves her
Could you borrow me a tenner?
Your dad'll have it.
- There you go.
- Thank you. Thank you so much.
Come on, Ally. Come on.
He loves her,
he loves her, he loves her
He loves her,
he loves her, he loves her
It was one night.
It wasn't meant to happen.
She was going away.
We were just saying goodbye.
You wanted to give her
something to remember you by.
It wasn't like that.
- Did you know?
- Know what?
- About this girl?
- No. No.
I knew nothing until that arrived.
It's 25 years ago, Jean.
We were married, Rab.
We'd made our vows.
What can I say?
What can I do?
Tell me.
I want you to get out of my sight.
I don't wanna look at you.
Ladies and gentlemen, can I have
your attention for a minute, please?
-  Oh, my God. What's he doing?
- Thank you.
Now, we all know who we're here
to celebrate tonight. Rab and Jean.
I don't know
where they've gone.
But I'd like to do
some celebrating of my own.
So I need to ask someone a question.
Liz, I don't know what
the next 25 years is gonna bring us,
but I do know I want
to spend 'em with you.
Liz Henshaw,
will you do me the honour
of becoming my wife?
I can't.
I can't. Ally, I can't.
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.
I'd better go after her.
Wee man, I hope you kept
the receipt for that.
It's just a joke.
It's a joke, man.
It was just a joke, man.
- What did you say to me?
- What?
Who are you?
- Calm down. Control yourself.
- I'm not taking that from anybody.
- Just leave it. Back off.
- Leave me alone, Davy.
Hey, you, think you're
a big man, do you?
Do you want me to kill you?
Do you want me to break you pal?
Hit me again
and find out what happens.
- Yvonne. Yvonne.
- Let's go.
- Who are you?
- You saw what happened.
- Liz. Lizzie.
- You cannae do that, Ally.
You should have warned me.
Would that have stopped you
walking out on me?
- What was I supposed to do?
- You were supposed to say yes.
Come on. Come on.
We're going home. Come on.
I'll put the kettle on.
You not going to work?
You sick or something?
I could skip school.
We could play the Xbox
or go down to the park if you want.
See you later, then, Ally.
See you.
You should have said.
I would have done the shopping.
It's done now.
How was work?
You want a cup of tea?
Stop acting as if
nothing's happened.
What do you want me to say?
I made a mistake.
It was a long time ago.
Do you think there's an expiry date
on these things,
that after a while
you can't be held responsible?
No, what I'm saying is
we've been through a lot in that time
and I think that you should
remember some of that stuff.
That makes it worse,
knowing that this thing's
been there all that time,
like a wee tumour
poisoning everything.
Why do we stay together?
What do you mean?
What if it's just habit?
What if it's 'cause we're
too frightened to do anything else?
No, you don't believe that.
I don't know anymore.
We'll get through this.
I promise you, we will
get through it. We'll sort it.
I don't want you to see her again.
- You mean Eilidh.
- I don't want to hear her name.
I don't want to have to think
about her or her mother.
Even
- She's my daughter.
- Don't you dare.
This is my family.
She's not part of it.
- I will not allow it.
- You want me just to cut her off?
You hardly know her.
No. No, I can't do that.
It's not her fault.
Then she's all you'll be left with.
I like the smell of perfume
You should have warned me.
You should have said something.
I did.
All that stuff about the future?
We spoke about it.
And I told you that it scared me.
I thought it was what you wanted.
Why would you think that?
Because you said
it's what everybody wanted.
For God's sake, Ally.
We have a great time together.
I love being with you.
You're my best pal.
That doesn't mean
I'm ready to march down the aisle.
You've gotta settle down sometime.
I don't want to settle.
- You don't wanna settle for me.
- That's not what I meant.
So what do you want? What is it
that you want that's so much better?
I want the world.
Ally, you know,
I want sunshine and skyscrapers.
Languages I don't understand.
Music I've never heard before.
It sounds like a travel brochure.
- Don't laugh at me.
- It hurts, doesn't it?
I'll talk to you later, OK?
No.
What else have we
got to talk about?
You don't mean that.
I don't want to be your pal, Liz.
Yvonne, we need to talk.
- I've got nothing to say to you.
- Then listen.
I know it looked bad
and it was bad.
- But it's not what you think.
- Leave me alone, Davy.
You're jumping to conclusions
and I understand why.
But I promise you,
I would never hurt you.
Thought that I'd be happy
Gonna be so happy
Living life alone
and never sharing anything
Thought that I was finished
Thought that I was complete
Thought that I was whole
instead of being half of something
Thought that I was growing
Growing older, wiser
Understanding why this world
held nothing for my spirit
Thought that I was destined
Destined to be nothing
Destined to be nothing in this world
and then I met you
- Maybe I just expect too much.
- Maybe you just expect the worst.
- You scared me.
- I know. I'm sorry.
- Thought the book was written
- Thought the game had ended
Thought the song was sung
and I could never sing another
Thought I knew this city
Thought I knew all about it
And then one night I went to
Morningside and you were waiting
Have you chucked that job
at the call centre, then?
Thing is, Ally, you need to have
a think about what you're doing,
where you're going.
- You can't stay here.
- I'll sort something out.
It's not fair on the wee ones.
- They need their space.
- Chrissie!
I'll sort something out.
How are you doing, sweetheart?
He doesn't wanna see me any more.
He's just hurting, Lizzie.
- It's not your fault.
- I'm the one who turned him down.
You've gotta make your own mind
up about what's right for you.
Anybody that cares
about you will understand.
But what if...
What if what you want's
gonna hurt other people?
You cannae go along
with something for their sake.
It'll only make things
worse in the end.
I found this website.
It's a recruitment agency
for health care workers.
So I put my details in
and they came back with an offer.
- Florida?
- Yeah.
And you never said anything.
Well, you said
I should make up my own mind.
Come here.
That's great, your news, darling.
Thanks, Mum.
Yeah, I'm looking forward
to working with you, mate.
So long as you're up for a laugh.
Thank you.
- Hiya.
- Your name?
- If you make it out to Rab.
- Rab.
No. Robert.
- Robert.
- Yeah.
- OK.
- Can I ask you a personal question?
If you were to fall
out with your partner
and you wanted to cook something
really special to win them over,
anything in this book
you'd recommend?
Are we talking simple but sweet
or seriously impressive?
I was hoping for bloody miraculous.
Escallops of veal and Marsala.
It's a classic.
Veal?
Veal.
Veal?
OK.
You forgot your book.
Are you kidding me?
I could fly to Italy for 17 quid.
It's like he's been
lying to me all this time.
-  Have you thrown him out?
- He's on the couch.
Should be in a kennel if you ask me.
And Liz is moving halfway
round the world for a new job.
-  Where's she going?
- Florida.
Florida? I'd love to go there.
My family's falling apart.
I feel like it's my fault.
Jean, I'm sorry,
I couldn't help overhearing.
Harry, I'm just being stupid.
Aye, you are being stupid if
you think any of this is your fault.
Come here. Come on. Come on.
- It can happen in any family.
- Come on. Come on.
Mary Queen of Scots,
born 1542, died 1587.
Her third husband
murdered her second husband,
her cousin tried her for treason
and her son stole her throne.
It's true. If she was alive today,
she'd be on the Jeremy Kyle Show.
So you listen to me, Jean Henshaw.
Whatever happened is not your fault.
You have done nothing but work yourself
into the ground for your family.
You've been letdown,
messed around
Told to get your feet
back on the ground
- Should have been loved
- Loved, loved
- You should have been loved
- Should have been loved
Told an act of kindness
makes you soft
- Should have been loved
- Loved, loved
- You should have been loved
- Should have been loved
But all your detractors
underestimated you
Aye, it's been rough
You've put up with stuff
Times when we thought
you'd had enough
- Should have been loved
- Loved, loved
- You should have been loved
- Should have been loved
And anything new
you tried to do
Got you treated
like a jumper in a queue
- Should have been loved
- Loved, loved
- You should have been loved
- Should have been loved
- Should have been loved
- Should have been loved
- Should have been loved
- Should have been loved
Ooh, my back!
Whoa, your detractors
underestimated you
'Cause they don't
know you like we do
Told to get my feet
back on the ground
When I should have been
loved, loved, loved
Should have been loved
Should have been loved
Should have been loved
Should have been loved
Should have been loved
Should have been loved
Should have been loved
Should have been loved
Bloody veal.
Are you all right?
Yeah.
You are gonna have to speak to him,
you know.
I know.
I'm scared, Rab.
You're scaring me.
At least you're not complaining
about me holding your hand.
You never liked that, did you?
Shoved them in your pockets
rather than walk down the street
like this.
But I rumbled you.
Years ago.
When my dad died.
You held my hand then.
You held onto it.
Tight.
My heart was broken
Yeah, yeah, yeah
The tests suggest the damage
isn't as extensive as we feared.
He was lucky.
I've given him a sedative.
He'll be out for some time.
You should think
about getting some rest yourselves.
I'm not leaving him.
Mum, he's out of danger.
The doctor's right, OK?
I'm taking you home to get some rest.
I'm not leaving him here on his own.
I'll stay. You go home.
I'll call you when he wakes up.
Are you sure?
All right.
Hiya, Dad.
- Hey, honey.
- Hey.
How are you feeling today?
- Yeah, I'm OK.
- Yeah? Good.
Except for Miami.
Passport, visa, suntan lotion.
I'm not going, Dad.
What, because of me?
No.
How do you think I'm gonna feel if I
thought you didn't go because of me?
Come on.
I wanna be lying
here thinking of you
driving the wrong side of the road,
your Cadillac,
checking your swimming
pool for crocodiles.
Alligators, Dad.
Whatever.
You have to go.
I can't, Dad.
I remember when you were little
and we used to go
on those crazy summer holidays.
You were the adventurous one.
You were all over the place.
More than Davy,
and that's saying something.
But abroad, Dad,
it's different.
Hey, you're a Scot.
We have to travel to get work.
- Always have and we always will.
- You never moved.
Glasgow to Edinburgh,
if you don't mind.
Had a nosebleed at
Waverley Station.
I don't want you spending
the rest of your life wondering.
You have to go out there.
You have to grab it.
OK, look, I'm gonna go.
- Let you get some...
- No, no, no. No, no.
You have to promise me first.
Promise me you'll go.
I don't want you just
staying for me.
Promise me you'll go.
OK.
OK what?
Is that a promise?
- OK, I promise.
- Yeah? Big promise?
Big grown-up, cross
your heart, hope to die,
spit on your mother's
grave kind of promise?
Yeah, I promise.
Gotta go, OK?
Thanks, Dad.
So where have you been, man?
Been looking for you.
I wanted space.
Look, Ally, I'm sorry. I wish
it could have worked out better.
I hear she's going away.
Makes sense, I suppose.
I know it feels like
the end of the world, but it's not.
Things move on. You'll get over it.
So Davy's got it all sussed, has he?
Davy and Yvonne.
What happens when
you make a mistake?
Maybe you say the wrong thing,
ask the wrong question.
You wait and see
how quickly she dumps you then.
I'm just trying to help.
I don't remember asking
for your help.
So what are you gonna do?
Well, there's nothing
for me here now, so...
- Where are you gonna go?
- Where do you think I'm going?
I've joined up again.
Ally, you know what it's like out there.
You know what can happen.
- It's not that bad.
- We nearly died, Ally. It's crazy.
So it's not what
we're supposed to be doing?
Looking for some sort of adventure,
something new, something else?
- Not settling for what we've got?
- What about Ronnie?
Think he'd settle for what he's got?
- Ronnie was unlucky.
- You need to think about this.
- I have.
- Think again.
- Stop telling me what to do.
- Why would you want to go back?
Because they wanted me!
- Ally, I'm begging You-
- Davy.
I get it.
You need to let me do this.
Keep your head down.
Don't do anything stupid.
D'you hear?
Hey.
I'll be fine.
I'll be fine.
Hi, Rab. Jean dropped this off
earlier for you when you were asleep.
I thought I'd pop it in.
Where's that?
That's Ullapool, I think.
Have you been up there?
No, I've been meaning to.
It looks so beautiful.
Lizzie.
- We're all gonna miss her.
- Yeah.
As if my heart
wasn't breaking enough.
The joys of parenthood.
You'll want to go shopping when you
get there. You don't need all this.
Tell me about the hospital again.
Well, it's a teaching hospital,
so I could choose a specialism
and do a masters if I want.
Well, you'd better.
What will you go for?
- Nurse practitioner?
- That's nearly a doctor, isn't it?
Not quite.
Well, that's what I'll be telling people
when I'm bragging about you.
You'll be fine, Lizzie.
You'll be fine.
Go on, try that now.
When you go will you send back
Broke off from my work the other day
I spent the evening thinking about
all the blood that ﬂowed away
Across the ocean
to the second chance
I wonder how it got on
when it reached the promised land
When you go will you send back
I've looked at the ocean
Tried hard to imagine
The way they felt the day they sailed
from Wester Ross to Nova Scotia
We should have held you
We should have told you
But you know our sense of timing
When you go will you send back
Lochaber no more
Sutherland no more
Lewis no more
Skye no more
Lochaber no more
Sutherland no more
Lewis no more
Skye no more
Lochaber no more
Sutherland no more
Lewis no more
Skye no more
I wonder, my blood
Will you ever return
To help us kick the life back
to a dying mutual friend
Do we not love her?
Do we not say we love her?
Do we have to roam the world
to prove how much it hurts?
When you go
will you send back
Bathgate no more
Linwood no more
Methil no more
Irvine no more
Bathgate no
more Linwood no more
Methil no more
Irvine no more
Bathgate no more
Linwood no more
Methil no more
Irvine no more
Bathgate no more
Linwood no more
Methil no more
Irvine no more
Across the ocean
When it reached the
promised land
Everything with your dad
makes you think a bit, doesn't it?
If the same thing happened to my mum,
I'd wanna be there for her too.
Of course.
Even if it meant me going home?
Nothing has happened to your mum.
- Has it?
- No, but it could.
What if I had to go?
Well, then, I'd understand.
I thought you might be a little bit
more concerned than that.
- Well, course I'd be concerned.
- Well, good.
That's a slight improvement
on 'I'd understand'.
What's the problem here?
- This is all hypothetical.
- But this isn't, us. This is real.
- I thought this was about your mum.
- No, Davy, this is about me and you.
If something happens,
I wanna know if you'd come with me.
- To England?
- Does it matter where?
Well, aye, if it's England.
What?
Look, my family's here.
I can't just abandon them.
You ran off to the
army quick enough.
- This is ridiculous.
- Oh, right, so I'm being ridiculous.
- Aren't you?
- OK, fine.
Tell me, if I went,
would you come with me?
Or what? That's us finished?
- It's not an ultimatum.
- Well, it sounds like it.
- Well, answer the question, then!
- No.
- I think you'd better go, then.
- Fine, I will.
Ally?
Hi, Ma.
How you doing?
Yeah, I'm good, thanks.
Yeah, no, I just...
I thought I'd ask how you'd feel
about me maybe coming
home for a bit.
Well, I don't really know yet.
Maybe quite a while.
Or for good.
Not sure.
So am I back on the couch?
You broke your vows, Rab.
I cannae pretend it didn't happen.
I cannae act like
I'm not hurt by it.
But I'll live with it.
Thank you.
I'm not gonna stop seeing Eilidh.
With Liz and Davy,
you made me promise
that I would be as good
a father as I could be.
And I tried. I'm still trying.
But you just can't turn
that off like it's a tap.
I need to try for her.
I need to see her.
What are you thinking?
I think you're stubborn.
Infuriating.
And utterly predictable.
So are we going home
together or what?
Why don't you ask the driver?
Hi.
Hiya.
How are you feeling?
Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.
Good.
Right.
Car's just outside.
Dad wants a cup of tea.
I'll make it.
You all right?
Aye, fine.
Do you wanna make it work?
- Eh?
- You and Yvonne.
Do you really wanna make it work?
- Aye, I do, but...
- No buts, Davy.
If you love her,
just go and get her.
- Where are you going?
- I need to speak to Yvonne.
She's gone.
You're too late.
What do you mean?
Where's she gone?
- I don't know if I'm allowed to say.
- Francine.
- Well, I...
- Where's she gone?
She's gone to get the train home,
to England.
She was really upset.
What? I had to tell him.
They're in love.
Sorry.
Yvonne!
Yvonne, wait, please. Yvonne.
- What do you want?
- I need to ask you a question.
- I don't wanna talk to you.
- I need to know something.
I'm gonna be late
for my train, Davy.
Do you want to make this work?
- What?
- You and me, I mean.
- Do you want to make this work?
- Look, Davy...
I don't know how things'll work out,
Yvonne, and I can live with that.
But if you're not ready
to take that chance...
Me? What do you mean,
if I'm not ready?
- So you are ready?
- No, not any more.
- But you just said...
- I was ready.
And then you made your
position perfectly clear.
But, I thought you were
looking for an excuse to end it.
I was looking for a reason
to keep going.
- Why didn't you say that?
- I did. I asked you and you said no.
- That wasn't the question.
- Yes, it was.
Was it?
Look, look, ask me again,
but this time
please keep it simple.
Your family, your home, they're
important to you, I get that, but...
I don't know where I fit in.
You're a part of all
of that now.
What if I have to leave
and you have to choose?
I don't wanna be the one
who loses out.
Well, then, tell me honestly,
do you want to make this work?
Do you think I'd be
standing here if I didn't?
Is that a yes?
Yes.
So?
So?
Right.
If you have to go back to England,
I'll come with you.
- Really?
- Really.
I don't mind.
Actually, it's not true.
I would mind.
But I'd still come.
When I wake up
Well, I know I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the one
who wakes up next to you
When I go out
Well, I know I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the one
who goes along with you
If I get drunk
Well, I know I'm gonna be

And if I haver
Hey, I know I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the man

If I'm working
Yeah, I know I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the one
who's working hard for you
And when the money
comes in for the work I do
I'll pass almost
every penny on to you
And if I grow old
Well, I know I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the one
who's growing old with you
And when I come home
Well, I know I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the one
who comes back home to you
When I'm lonely
Well, I know I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the one
who's lonely without you
And when I'm dreaming
Well, I know I'm gonna dream
I'm gonna dream
about the time I had with you
And when I go out
Well, I know I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the one
who's thinking about you
When I come home
Yes, I know I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be
The one who comes back home to you
I'm gonna be the one
who's coming home to you
And I would walk 500 miles
Just to be the man
who walks a thousand miles
And I would walk 500 miles
Just to be the one
who walks a thousand miles
- Come on, hen, up here.
- Come on, follow us.
- Come on.
- This way.
- Be cool.
- Come on, girls! Get up!
Come on.
And I would walk 500 miles
Just to be the one
who walks a thousand miles
Just to be the one
who walks a thousand miles

I wanna take your hand.
Sorry about that.
