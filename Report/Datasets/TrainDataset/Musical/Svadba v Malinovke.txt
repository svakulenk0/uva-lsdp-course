What is in the power nowadays
in your Malinovka?
- Nobody. Nobody, believes me
- How can it be?
And what is this?
Nobody, except grandpa Nitchepore.
I told him so.
And he?
And he told me to convey greetings
from valorous Red Cavalry to grandpa Nitchepore
And all other inhabitants. From Kotovsky.
- From cavalry?
- Red Cavalry?
Why are you screaming?
Maybe they'll call in on the way?
- But you don't call.
- No, of course.
- And you don't call.
- Yes, sure.
What else?
- A, I remember. Hello, Irene.
- There you are.
Hello, Andrew.
I thought that you've forgotten.
How you could think so, Irene.
- Ups, your boss.
- Baliasniy.
Pr-r guys. Stop.
Come to stand still all of you.
I called in to you on my way.
I live on such place, everyone who
passes through certainly calls in to me.
This happens quite often,
and with everyone.
Stamp a seal for my well being
on this ticket,
that I handed in allotment.
- Handed in?
- Handed in.
And not in 5 pounds like others.
But in 100 pods and all power to the Soviet.
Please stamp a seal.
And where've you been today's
morning, my dear?
- I've been to the farriery.
- Someone told me that you've been to the monastery.
- Who told you that lie?
- A magpie brought that news.
- She told you lies.
- Magpie isn't a dog. She never lies.
I'll tell you in secret, there is a rumor,
that the regime will change soon.
- Stamp a seal.
- Don't make haste.
- You think that it will change?
- There's a rumor.
Well, let's go. Go, go.
I'm sick of sheep farming here,
at Poyasniy farm.
You know, Irene, if Red Cavalry
will call in on the way I'll join them.
- To fight.
- Right. And I'm going with you.
- You can't, you'll be killed.
- And you?
I'm not that kind of person.
- Is you mother at home?
- No. Kiss. Mother.
Well, I'm fleeing.
What are you daubing these trees for?
- Who is here else?
- No one, I'm alone.
- Something loomed to me...
- Andrew came to grandpa Nitchepore.
- Then, she'd been kissing with Nitchepore?
- Ups mother, noticed.
I've noticed that from Christmas.
- Fell in love?
- Yes.
- And he?
- Yes.
What should we do with you?
Marry you off?
Oh, mommy!
Mother, isn't it frightful to get married?
To get married? No.
To merry is more frightful.
A damned wretch like you can come across
a boy, and he'll be plagued with her.
- Oh, mommy
- I was justjoking.
My dear daughter.You grew up like an orphan,
and now you're like a cherry in spring.
You're like your father.
No mother
You're very beautiful.
Oh, daughter.
- May I go and gladden Andrew?
- Yes.
Nitchepore. Nitchepore.
Nitchepore. Nitchepore.
What? Why is my Gapusia running?
Nitchepore. Are you here, sweet?
Let's go quickly to Trindichiha.
To Trindichiha, who angrily
can do heaven knows what.
Therefore, When Trindichiha,
is angry! Oh!
What if someone will hitch her,
then she'll do a queer thing.
That everything will go wrong.
And if she is angry...
Don't make haste.
I'm asking for 35 years, Gapusia, don't has
ten, because we're not sure. Understand?
What has happened?
Here, as always
I can't put in a word.
And I keep silent.
Because I'm not a wife, I'm an angel.
And if you're an angel,
why do you live among people?
Where's the power? Grannies, follow
me! Follow me! Grannies!
Come here! Where the power?
- Stop women.
- Here is the power. Yes?
We've put you over us,
for the order could be established.
And I'm mocked!
- We'll investigate now.
- There's nothing to investigate.
Oh, Komariha! I gave her sweet
milk, and what did she return me?
Sour. Yes?
Shame on you!
You don't think that I'm weak,
I can hit!
And I can too.
Quiet! Quiet!
We'll investigate.
Not sour. We tasted it. Here is she,
she and she. The milk is sweet.
- Sour.
- Sweet.
- Sour.
- Sweet. - Sour.
I can't come over. How can't you come over?
You have to protect me.
I'm a woman nevertheless.
I can't come over.
- Hungry.
- It's better now, grannies.
Here what I'll tell you,
I've been to the town.
People say that Red Cavalry is just
about to capture "Prikup".
Really?
It seems that the war
will be finished soon.
Oh, grannies,
husbands will come back home.
Trindichiha, neighbor.
Or we're not tell-tales with you?
To one a husband will come
back.To another will not.
Pan Chechil stole him to the Siberia.
Aches, aches, aches my head.
Without reason.
The road is tenantless.
And with no one to stroll with.
Why are you driving your women
totears, Sofia Mihailovna?
Oh, your women's tears
If I'll shed a tear.
Don't hurry up.
Oh, troubles with chickens.
If you'll not look after - they'll die.
Women's tears are like water
The are fading along the way.
Like on the river, on the brook,
I kiss the one I don't know who.
Greg, why am I in such sympathize with you?
The regime changes again?
- Hello, compatriot.
- Hurrah.
Hurrah.
Grannies, look it's Gridko.
Just look how he dressed up.
Hey, did you become Petlura?
I'm Petlura in my self.
Don't play jokes here.
I have a whole cavalry here
in the monastery.
Just imagine Gridko.
Gridko was but then disappeared. Where
is my first aide-de-camp? Papandopala.
I'm here Greg.
- Appeal to me.
- Please.
- Pan ataman Grecian Tavricheskiy.
- Stand at ease!
- Did you hear?
- Tell me, grandpa Nitchepore.
I wanted to ask you,

Appeal to me one more time,

are gesticulationamong the public.
- Let's disperse beautifully.
- Say.
I want to ask you,
Pan ataman Grecian.
- Vricheskiy.
- Shut up.
Aha, Vricheskiy. Do you have as they
say any schedule?
Sure, we can't do anything without a schedule.
Do you think that I'm a gangster from a big road?
I'm an ataman with
firm ideological principles.
- And all my boys like one.
- Fight for the freedom of the personality.
Then, they will rob.
I've been to Tavria, Moldavia,
I've seen many things and places.
And decided to establish in your
volost independent power.
Why am I in such sympathize with you?
Maybe you stand up
for the soviet power?
Then we'll do it in 2 weeks,
we can even faster.
At once if you like in 45 minutes.
Don't hurry up.
On the sea sand
I met Marusia.
In pink stockings, waist in the corset.
In pink Stockings. Waist in the corset.
Irene, I'll make you ataman's woman
I'll sew expensive smart dresses for you.
- I'll take you.
- Where?
Into my band. In the cavalry. I'll give you a sabre.
I'll give you a horse. Let's go to the shed.
What if a patrol.
It rides out a storm.
Goodbye, Pava.
I'll come back soon.
Goodbye, Pava.
I'll come back soon.
Don't get into this. Don't get
into this. I don't wish that.
Leave her alone. Do you think
that if you wear a sabre,
Then you can get
any girl?
If you want, I'll celebrate
a wedding tomorrow.
Again wedding.
Where are you Marusia
with whom are you walking?
You kiss the other, and bite me.
You kiss the other and bite me.
Don't turn over, Sofia Mihailovna.
God knows, I didn't want
to offend my people.
And if I'll have a chance
I'll burn Malinovka to decay.
I won't leave.
Catch her.
Sofia Mihailovna, where are you going?
Catch her.
No, I'm contused. Greg,
you know my nervous system.
Don't take umbrage, boy, but in the
presence of people don't call on me.
You,f ailing, are gone with the wind,
and they will demand from me.
- Never mind, Chechil will arrive,
everything will get better.
- Chechil?
If I knew how he looks like this
Chechil, black or white.
Black, white.
Boys are not satisfied with me.
They say, what is an ataman
without gold reserves.
Father. Pennies.
We are good at taking pennies.
Look boy. Look.
Chechil will have a document.
In the home-rolled cigarette.
Commander, when he was running,
he threw it into the bush.
- And this what he had with him.
- English?
Yours?
Who is he? Where?
For what? As you were.
Are you interested?
Get up!
I didn't expect.
With you father, Pan Chechil
We are old friends,
but i didn't make friends with you.
We travel more to Capitals,
and abroad.
Well, glad to meet you.
Commander of a special horse
troop Nazar Duma.
I ask again, who are you?
Where? For what?
To the headquarters.
- Well done, boys. Well done.
- Well done.
- Boys, did you give sea-roaches?
- Yes.
And maybe you're Kotovskiy in person?
No, it's Basil.
And this is Peter - bessarabian,
your commander assistant.
From where? Why? For what?
I'm from Malinovka. There...
What?
Break up. Break up.
What didn't you see here?
Simple man,

Maybe, she is hungry?
Madam, take this sea-roach,

Nibble it, nibble. If the major here

What is it in our Malinovka?
Grecian with his band.
fell on me, and said : I'll marry you.
The wedding is tomorrow.
Madam, I beg you,

Basil, sea-roach.
Madam, nibble it, nibble.
- Then, he's going to marry.
- And you?
- And I say : "no"
- And he?
- And wanted to kiss me.
- And you?
And I ran away, and his
aide-de-camp ran after me.
And I fetched a blow with rakes
along his back, bang, in half.
- His back in half?
- No, rakes.
How I like such clever
and conscious madams.
- Now you'll stay with us?
- No. I have mother and Andrew at home.
- Andrew? Who is Andrew?
- He's my fiance.
Commander,
girls from Malinovka.
I've heard everything. But nobody
must know that you've been to us.
- And mother?
- Your mother especially.
And Andrew?
Do you want to marry Andrew?
Then don't tell him anything.
Andrew.
Oh, wind my wind,
tell where are you going.
Where are you rushing off?.
Tell me, the wind,
my friend with the wings.
Don't you want to help a boy?
Fly my wind, fly my wind.
Fly faster, fly without idleness.
And find a sweetheart,
wherever you want.
Bow from the waist.
Without complains.
You'd better carry off Balasniy's
horse and gallop to the "Camels".
Irene ran away right there.
And while Grecian isn't there...
I'll...
Well, well without foolishness.
And remember, if you'll meet
anywhere one of us, don't recognize.
And don't tell anything,
anybody about your aims.
And don't be afraid of Grecian.
He's already gone from Malinovka.
- He galloped to the monastery.
- I'm not afraid.- Well, brave one
I exorcised you. And
you're chilled and must be hungry.
Well boys,
feed and warm this girl.
Very good.
Lets go.
- What's your name?
- Irene.
You're pretty Irene.
Other rich girls have
houses that are full trunks.
They have poplins, they have sateen
But they have nothing inside themselves.
I like a girl
without poplins and sateen.
Just like Irene
We'll take her with us on our campaign.
I wish I could go with you,
But I have to get back home.
Come back to us soon.
The whole village will meet you.
Nightingale fell into silence,
Relatives are waiting for their sons.
I'll walk out to the field, and finish my singing
I'll tell about my love in it.
We'll find our happiness.
And will enter the future with it.
There's no other life more beautiful than
ours. We'll go through joy and grief.
The team heads on to the Perekop
according their route.
And we're heading on to Malinovka.

Why are you sad, Nazar Vasiljevich?
These are my native lands, Peter.
I recall my house, wife, daughter.
You didn't tell us about them.
Where are they now?
I don't know. After revolution
I tried to find out.
Our village was burned to decay,
and people scattered.
So, I've lost their trace. This is
all about it, Peter.
Well.
Here what, go!
Is time to rest for our troop.
- And at dawn we'll make
your way towards Malinovka.
- Yes, Nazar Vasiljevich!

Bur it can't be bowed, can't be bowed.
Where've you been?

Where've you been?
Andrew, repeat after me:
"I promise".

I promise. And where've you been?
- Don't look at me like that.
- How do look at you?
- If you love me, then believe me.
- I believe and love.
But your Andrew must know
where've you been a whole night.
If you'll ask one more time,
I'll drive you out of here.

I lived in Odessa
I swam in the Black Sea.
All people on the beach knew me.
I sang verses and played guitar.
I played with love. And now it's

And my heart burns ardently in my chest.
And now it's clear, Odessa is real,
And we have the different way.
You are a child prodigy.
- And what's the matter?
- What the hell.
Listen, soldier, whyam
I in such sympathize with you?
Okay, you'll play today
on the wedding.
Okay, I can play. Whose wedding?
- Pan ataman Grecian Tavricheskiy.
- Wow.
Maybe you didn't hear about him?
Ha, I heard. It's the chief ataman
in the whole province.
If he'll get a machine-gun, then
no one of our enemies will stay alive.
And what do you think?
You think that we don't have machine-guns?
We have...
Somebody is overhearing us. Hey...
Listen...
Do you know how many machine-guns we
have? We have seven machine-guns.
Really?
I'm a machine gunner myself.
- Do you know how to repair them?
- Seeing what's broken.
Other 3...
One jams, other,
bobs up.
And the third fires at one's own people.
And the seventh, in secret from pan
ataman, I exchanged for this trousers.
Look. How wonderful they are... really?
Listen, soldier,
why am I so in love?
- Hell knows.
- Join our band.
I'll arrange a protege for you.
No, I humbly thank you. We
have spent enough time in fighting.
And then, how can we old men
measure swords with you boys. No. No.
We have great boys.
Vile animals, just like me.
No, no.
Division. But not a whole
approximately...
On the whole, we could assemble more
but pan ataman has very poor gold reserves.
And boys began to disperse
And they are doing right.
If it will continue in this way
I'll disperse also.
All division is getting
drunk in the monastery.
And I'm lest alone here.
The wedding is today, in the evening.
You'll be playing.

A soldier song flies over the land.
And silently soldier will

He'll meet a harsh spring dawn.
And hears a filed this soldier song.
Regards from a native, far heart.
- She is a soldier too?
- Widow. She's mysterious.
And somewhere peel not quieten down hoofs
The dwelling is treated down, the grass is smoking.

Why are you crying, my sweetie?
What should I do? I haven't kissed

Please, take it.
Thank you. So girls

To the monastery. Tell Grecian,
that they have only 31 people.
- What is it on you?
- It's a jacket.
Give me, I'll try on.
Give it to me to wear.
Oh great. It's just cut for me.
I'll better die,
than I'll join Grecian band.
The troop will hide in the ambush.
We need this wedding for
our common business.
Don't be afraid, we won't let
you be offended. I will be there also.
But remember, daughter, you don't know me.
You wouldn't permit you daughter do that.
I'll for you, my dear,
break anyone's neck.
- Don't you believe?
- I believe.
Here, no one will hear I my complaints.
Even if I couldn't seize them
in my heart.
Don't dim my tears and my
sight don't weary, grief.
Is it possible that only disgrace
is lest for this poor girl?
Here, no one will hear I my complaints.
Even if I couldn't seize them
in my heart.
Do not haze the sight my tears.
Do not stew my sorrow.
- Is it possible that only
disgrace is left for me in this life.
- Only disgrace?
You hand bitte dritte.
Battalion, tube number 15, sight
The wedding will be
special.
Come in freeman
I'll feed you.

Please go, I ask,
I ask politely.
Receive this dear guest.
Fell.
Quick, saddle horses.
Commander.
I'm sorry father, I have no time,

When you see my signal with this
small lamp, light this haystack.
Yes Sir! I'll do that.
Let's go.
Regime changes again.
We'll go bravely to the fight.
For the power of Soviets.
And we'll die all for one
in the fight for this.
Gone. I'm late.
I've cooked patties for them.
Maybe you'll taste?
- With great pleasure.
- With poppies.
- I like them.
- They are gone, and you've stayed.
Stay Jacob Alexandrovich.
You only remind me my
favorite howitzer.
My favorite reliable howitzer.
Where is it,
your favorite howitzer?
Was perished in unequal fight.
You're a widower, Jacob Alexandrovich?
- Oh.
- Are you okay, Jacob Alexandrovich?
Personal contusion.
You 3 inch eyes,
neatly hit.
And sparked volcanic fire
in my heart. Bang! Bang!
I've been walking through the foreign land.
I've been dreaming of a native land.
I've been going throught
the forests at night.
I like here and I like you.
Oh, sehr gut. Excuse me madam.
Once we'll live in live in our land.
Once a nightingale will begin to sing.
You can dream to me all nights.
But my heart will tell you one.
We are judged to love but once.
You'll fall in love,
and will never regret.
Days and nights pass through,
but love still lives
They share theirjob and care on Shanks'.
And like a water fall their
time still goes.
And their far way
leads them to happiness.
The anxiety will be forgotten
with you my friend.
You'll fall in love,
and will never regret.
Days and nights pass through,
but love still lives
What's with you? Let's go, let's go.
Did you see Kotovci?
- I saw.
- Get up. Get up.
Why are you angry?
- Did you serve bread to Kotovskiy?
- I've served.
One moment. Why didn't
you serve bread to me?
They've come with peace.
And you swooped down.
- Swooped down? And did they strike?
- Let's go.
You can put 500, 10000,
- And they went.
- Ah, so you'll act like this?
