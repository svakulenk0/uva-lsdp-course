- Urbani, a coach.
Do you want somewhere?
You come back yet, right?
The drive to the theater is six clock.
There is oh so much traffic.
* You talk at once. *
Did he say where he wants to go?
Did you hear her sing Charlotte?
- However.
And?
For an unbiased ear it
sounds quite pleasing.
That's it?
I am polite.
Unwanted desires, by
the unscrupulous goings
to be incited the so-called virtuoso
as think of anything else
to their insatiable lust
And what has brought us?
The scourge of our age. The
evil scourge of epidemics.
The self-indulgence has
brought upon us the plague.
Get out of here! You should
come down to times correctly.
The hard you'd regret it.
Because I was brought by
such a charlatan basis.
And just wore this disease in his body.
My life is destroyed. Of
your yard not gone too.
Can I destroy you again?
- Can you mean?
Oh, it would be my feast.
Madam, I am pleased to see you again.
Do I know you?
- We met in front of the Sablonniere.
I cherish the greatest
sympathy for your cause
Thank you.
- Please, go a piece with me.
Do me the honor a
conversation in private.
* He whispers something. *
Lordsburg Hersh, sir.
What an honor that you are here today.
Let us listen to the
fiddling of Paganini.
So, you are supplied. This is
good. Distributes you all a bit.
Everyone gets a pin and a music book.
Behave unremarkable. But
trying to take down everything.
And if you can record everything
there will be a nice gift for you
I have to ask though!
So full it was never before.
Each lodge, occupied every seat.
Apart from the royal box, of course.
The I have kept for the king free.
Waiting outside a lot. Do we sell it.
If the king says he comes,
the courts must be free.
Even if he changes his mind
He ​​is now 10 minutes late.
Mr. Rogers, he's so far?
If I knew that.
- Then look after for heaven's sake.
If he's ready.
Yes, but how long does it take to yet?
Where is he?
- He is not there yet.
He does not answer.
What do I do now? A
Violin Violin Concerto no.
Paganini!
On the stage with you. But
let yourself plenty of time.
Not too fast. Not too fast.
I can not play without him
He has never shown us the
notes for the solo voice.
Break a leg. But let
yourselves this time.
Enjoy.
So, I has to get out now.
You bring him here. I'm
begging you. Get him.
Good luck.
* Applause *

Where is he? I've already
What's going on?
- Do not panic. He's in there.
You already play. They
started with the overture.
He is in there? You do
not want to be disturbed.
What?
- You talk business.
Business? He ​​has
to play a concert.
Get him out.
- No. Impossible.
The concert has begun.
I should let no one.
No Niccolo!
Gently! Not at all.
* You play. *
Silence.

Screech from the audience '
Cheering and screaming *

Apparently he is the new violin God.
Excuse me.
- Please, I want to listen.
I'm from the Times' I would
like to mention you praise
Oh

Of course, like
Madame Tussaud wants Paganini
likeness create wax?..
For a new figure Exhibition
In a room full of celebrities
it calls celebrities Cabinet
Very resourceful
Would you like to be portrayed
would be the very
exciting for a young girl.
I had on something no claim.
I just sang, because
the maestro asked me.
What type exactly your
relationship to Paganini?
Please?
- Well, he is your music teacher?
Uh, no.
- But he lodges in your house.
In my father's house, Miss
- Langharn.
Ethel Langharn. You're how old again?
I did not say.
Do you want to know something else
* Voices *
Caution! It will overwhelm you.
- Niccolo!
Niccolo!
- The ladies of the way.
Charlotte!
- Niccolo!
Out of the way!
- Niccolo!
Way here!
- But where is Niccolo?
You can not wait. He
​​will send for you.
Mr. Watson.
- Good evening, Mr. Urbani.
The concert was excellent, is not it?
However. Have you seen my daughter?
Sure is enjoying her fame.
- Probably.
We had a full house. You
did not want to believe me.
We were successful, yes.
Could I have our share?
Well, it's late. We can
settle tomorrow clean.
I have to find Charlotte
- Do not resent me,
if I ask you for immediate payment!
I have to collect everything.
You will then receive it.
Is this your cut?
This must be fairly shared.
I have to pay the orchestra
I understand. So we'll keep that.
And we will divide, perfectly just,
if we do the billing.
- Good evening.
Apologies. Excuse me, ladies.
I beg you. I have to get
in there Quiet. Calm down.
He's not in there. Has
anyone seen Charlotte?
Miss Langharn, You look gorgeous.
Signor Urbani, you are
as a fascinating man.
I do not know I
supposed to restrain you.
You are difficult to control.
That would require a woman of your size.
In whom you enter into temptation?
Wherever I am treated kindly.
Miss Langharn, you liked the Maestro?
The pleasure was somewhat
marred to to be honest.
What extent '?
Now, it was up to the girl I
thought they were pretty clueless.
She is young. It is How young exactly?
My lips are sealed.
- I had expected.
High with you! I have a
suite reserved Sablonniere.
Let us enjoy of your triumph.
- Not without Charlotte.
She was stunning.
It would be unwise
arrive there with her.
I let the young lady
align where to find us.
You were incredible.
- So what I've never heard of.
Urbani. I can not bear all the people.
Send them away.
- As you wish, Maestro.
Where is Charlotte?
I have sent for her It
is determined on the go.
You must now rely. The
Maestro needs to rest.
Thank you. Waits. Can you stay?
Signor Urbani. Does your love to me?
No, no. It is not to my pleasure.
The poor fellow thinks he was in love.
A wretched condition. Of
which he must be weaned.
And who is the object of his desire
A young, pretty child.
About Your stature, Your hair color.
Signor Urbani. Your plan fascinates me.
She is a virgin.
Maestro. She's here.
Charlotte?
Charlotte.
- Love.
Paganini's forbidden
love for a young girl.
Paganini's concert. His
forbidden love to a young girl.

Yes.

Yes.

Sablonniere Suite 405
The newspaper reported today
of the shameful seduction
An innocent English girl
by foreigners Paganini.
She's still a child.
Can we sit idly
as such, hustle and
bustle corrupts our youth?
This music corrodes the
soul and destroyed our lives.
This music decomposes the soul.
Miss Watson.
The Maestro's in there.
I let him know that you are here
He is the same.
Good morning.
What is going on here?
Is this your business? I
want you never see her again!
Charlotte, wait!
As you wish
- Wait!
Charlotte, wait! Charlotte, stops!
Let me explain it.
- This is obsolete!
This is a mistake
- Who are you?
Why do you give yourself
from with Urbani?
He gives me the blood in the veins
freeze! Remains of the Body of me!
Wait!
- There is the innocent child.
And here comes the seducer!
Do you see how shameless
he is after her?
He ​​has lured to his hotel!
She's broken and humiliated!
He has ruined them! Then he left them!
The wrath of the English people
to chase him out of our country!
Charlotte!
- We Spank his ass!
Charlotte! Charlotte!
Urbani! Urbani!
Urbani!
Stop it!
Urbani! Italian scum!
Charlotte!
- Way here.
Let me explain it.
Charlotte, let me explain.
Please, I beg you I have nothing please.
This is an outrage! This is an outrage!
Why do you imprison me? I am the victim!
It has attacked me for no reason!
Take care of him. He
​​raped a child.
What?
- That's not true.
Lies!
- A Mädchenschänder.
Lies.
- Oh yeah?
* Paganini screams in pain. *
An English girl to seduce.
Ah!
Charlotte.
- Papa!
Charlotte. It is, as you see, a lady.
As you can lock them up?
I am known. The press reports about me.
Come to me, my child,
out nothing happened.
How fast your are fallen from grace.
Urbani.
I am ready to forgive
you your disloyalty.
I prefer to let me beat a thousand times
Never again will I let
myself one with you.
My they have not really loved.
You loved this, what you saw in her.
Your innocence.
Someone whose purity you
redeemed of your many sins.
But she's made of flesh and blood.
Likewise, sensual and
ambitious as you are.
The upshot was predetermined.
Your she would have destroyed.
Corruption. With the
same glowing infection
seething in your blood.
I am not the devil.
I serve the devil.
And you are my master.
The bottle shatters. *
Are you okay?
Do not you wanna maybe go to fresh air?
Paganini has made known, where he is.
Where is he? Was in the newspaper
that he is going to Vienna.
He has taken the first
ferry from Dover yesterday.
Come, my child.
Come here. It's all good.
All good. Come here.
Hello. Hello.
Achilles. Achilles!
Achilles, I'm back!
It's so nice to see you again
I've missed you so.
You have so missed you,
my little Achillino.
How was your teacher?
- Strict.
What have! learned? Mathematics?
- No, he hit me.
And he can not cook.
Are you telling me the truth?
On guard!
- Oh, Maestro. Oh, Maestro.
You hit my son?
- No.
You hit my son?
Disappears! Get out of here!
Power that your coming out! Get out!
- Maestro.
Charlotte, how are you?
Has Paganini wrote to you?
Will you see him again?
- Give an answer.
How can we end this lie?
Well. I could write a letter
Or we sue for libel. That
would cost 500 pounds.
We do not even five
pounds. To mention 500 full
We should live with it.
- To live?
I'm not Paganini whore.
- We know that, my child.
We could consider as advertising.
What?
- The hardest thing for an artist
is to make his name known
Yours is just across London known.
You'll famous. Perhaps is
reported even in New York.
In this way, I want to not be known.
See how you can use the thing.
Attempt to make the best of it
You think of me speaks only envy.
But I know what it is,
miss an opportunity.
One that will never happen again
under certain circumstances.
What do you mean, Dad?
Hm, Paganini is as famous as Napoleon
Of this falls something from you.
We could arrange for you solo concerts.
Such messages are quickly forgotten.
"Dearest Charlotte,
because the excitement
laid to our last meeting
I could persuade you,
to rethink our situation
and to accompany me on a
concert tour on the continent
If we spend more time
and get to know us better
I hope you can give me confidence.
For I feel, between us is love.
In order to secure my future,
I opened the 'Casino Paganini " in Paris
It is a noble Konzerthaus
with games and reading rooms
If your kämt, would be a fabulous place
for your debut in Paris
There is not a day that I do not myself
yearn after your loving glance
After living, that you radiate,
that fills me with hope
The feeling in me is
stronger than I can bear it
It is completely new to me
I implore you, to recognize my sincerity
and to believe me that I
am you totally submissive. "
Dear Niccolo,
your offer has touched me.
But as you I lead an artist's life
and I'm with papa go to America,
where I give a series of concerts
Without your inspiration it
would never have happened.
You are the greatest violinist
and I know that the
brilliant creations,
the graces that you can call
your using a bow string,
consolation to you at
the loss of a mortal. "
You have all invested in
the success of this company
You have no choice
You said, it is the only safe way
win in Game
Na, we're going
And after your appearance the
card game is waiting for you
You play so fond of.
The casino was your heart's desire.
I set you this only
the associates concerned.
You will not come.
You will not come. Because of you.
Here. I assure you, Maestro
they will not come, even if I go.
The concert will be a success.
- Yes.
The casino also.
- Mhm.
Charlotte will come.
All Paris will talk about us.
I'm done with you.
This time This time I'm serious.
You can not survive
without me, Maestro.
Error.
You are the can not survive.
Go.
As you wish.
Until we meet again, Maestro.
"Dearest Charlotte
I deliver myself from
another time your grace.
I have Urbani dismissed and stand here
as your servant, who is
eagerly waiting for a response
"Dear Niccolo

Please understand And changing
the tone of your letters
Out of respect before my new situation
To Wish me luck as I wish you. "
power the donkey.
* Laughter *
* They speak French. *
Where can we find Paganini?
I suspect he has fled from my complaint.
* He speaks Italian. *
Nice to be back in Italy.
Yes, Papa. Herrlich.
"Love Charlotte
I left Paris towards Genoa
Where I bought a house, withdraw to me.
The concert tour is finally over.
What with so much hope began
and so incomparably
successful, there was
ends with lasting fame.
But I have scars suffered,
that will never heal.
Although I have conquered Europe,
but with the profit I
can buy me no health.
Not even satisfaction.
But now that I have time,
I'll take my solo voices
concerts and write,
so that future
generations can try it... "
The priest is here
I'm healthy again I do not die
* The priest speaks Italian *
- Get out of here
Get out of here!
I'm healthy. For this
I pray with God's grace.
But you must not squander
the salvation of your soul.
God's grace.
- Confession! Your sins.
I'll tell you something
about God's grace.
God's grace.
Your God.
He has left me.
* She sings in Italian. *
He ​​has given me a gift.
And then left me in a world alone,
has not understood this gift.
Get out of here.
* He speaks Italian. *
I will defeat him.
I will
I will live forever.
* She sings in Italian. *
* She sings in Italian. *
Frenetic jubilation *
The church forbid Paganini
to be buried in Geweither soil
Achilles the pope decreed to revoke
all recognition.
