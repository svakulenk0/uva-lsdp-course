There once was a queen who gave birth
to such a deformed son...
that people long doubted whether
he could even be human.
The queen felt so horribly sorry
for her son...
that she banned him to
the far and barren forest of Hocus-Pocus.
For years and years the monster
lived there, hidden and lonely.
Until a nuclear missile from deep within
the Earth turned his life upside down.
This missile had in its womb
thousands of hoods, full of life.
The first to reach surface
was more beautiful than anything else.
The monster saw in the appearance
a sign sent from the gods.
And the slaughter began.
Many girls died in his claws.
Until one day, one of the girls
escaped her horrible destiny.
And this is how the legend of the old
lady with the bad legs...
Monster...
Many years have passed since
the monster died.
And haunted by her
memories of dancing...
the old lady dreamed of stealing
the last hood's legs.
This is the insanity of everyday.
So I'm telling life:
I love you, life!
-I feel rotten.
And I want to burn myself
-Tease with my fingers,
smiling,
my ears in the wind.
Speaking with my teeth,
And I, I want to make my
body shiver.
Come push the button and
the hood will come out.
Do it.
She's sleeping for years
-deep below the earth
Hey, come on. Push the button
and wake up that hood.
I don't want to be done yet...
where everything is hidden away.
I was dying of boredom
in thousand-and-one nights
and thinking of him
i can only say to boredom:
if only he was here again,
if only it was nice again,
shed some light into my night,
then there will only be warmth
in my heart.
No more here and there
only dum de dum.
And my little boy
only gets pretty flowers
a bunch of birds,
and my eyes in his mouth
crazy about my boy,
crazy from here to there,
crazy for life.
I'm telling my heart
that to die in your arms
wouldn't be so bad.
That's why I wish you were here again,
that's all I'm asking for.
Go touch.
Touch.
Her skin...
so soft...
sweet...
Her mouth, her eyes...
We are...
alone in the world.
Go to sleep, go to sleep.
Go to sleep, little girl.
Turn around and follow me
onto the road of happiness.
Go to sleep my little lamb.
Onto the Hocus-Pocus-Trail.
Come with me, come with me.
You're all
messed up.
Go to sleep, sleep...
Such long stilts.
Lovely, beautiful.
See you soon, girl.
Come here, little rabbit.
I'll squeeze you
until the last drop.
Your blood will be my energy.
Those stilts are mine.
Just for me.
Just a little while and I
will dance again.
In my eyes I see
blue suns
a trip sparkling with light
from a glittering cosmos,
I'm up in a thousand
kinds of smoke,
in bubbles of sparks,
A Hocus-Pocus-Garden.
Where mushrooms do the Polka,
in this spring I see...
the metaphorcerer's voice,
and suddenly my spirit
leaves me diagonally
A Hocus-Pocus-Garden
where everything sways and swings.
All the blood...
Monster!
Push the knob and the door
will open.
Time after time I see in you,
alchemy in spring
Time after time I read in you
shivers within,
but I read in these eyes
I can't tell what, how
horrible the fire is.
The fire of despair
And yet, and still
I feel in these fingers
the feeling of my joy,
I see in this arm
the wind of noise,
I see in this mouth
shy somethings,
and on this nose I see
the scent of a kiss,
I hear from this ear
the echo of a miracle,
the sound of a night
that's gone, forever.
The sound of a night
that's gone forever,
and the sound of he who burns
himself on poetry...
and comma, says: I love you.
We are...
alone in the world.
What big eyes you have.
That is...
That is too see you better, my child.
What big hands you have.
That is to touch you better, my child.
Why, what big...
teeth you have.
