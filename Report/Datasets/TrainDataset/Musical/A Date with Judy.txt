NARRATOR: That little city tucked
quietly against the mountains...
...is Santa Barbara, California.
Over 40,000 people live there.
When 40,000 people get together
somewhere, something must be happening.
Let's take a look.
This is Main Street. Only in Santa Barbara,
it's called State Street.
The people here are the same
as people anywhere.
Old people, young people.
For the most part, nice people.
And speaking of nice people,
this is Pop Scully's soda fountain.
Meeting place of the world, Pop calls it.
Everybody loves Pop
and everybody goes there.
That is, everybody except Mr. Pringle.
He's too busy.
He's owner of the local radio station,
sponsor of the community theater...
...president of the bank and he plays golf.
So Mr. Pringle
doesn't get home very often.
Too bad too, it's a beautiful home.
Mr. Foster is a busy man too.
He owns and operates
a fish cannery on the coast.
But he's never too busy
that he can't find time for his family.
Mr. Fosters' home isn't quite as beautiful
as Mr. Pringle's, but he thinks it is.
And he gets home often.
Just around the corner is the high school.
There's always something
going on here...
...especially when Judy Foster
and her friends are around.
Let's go in.
Now, just a minute,
you can't do that to us.
We'd like to come in.
That's better. Thank you very much.
WOMAN :
It's a most unusual day
Feel like throwing my worries away
As an old native-born
Californian would say
It's a most unusual day
There's a most unusual sky
Not a sign of a cloud passing by
And if I want to sing
Throw my heart in the ring
It's a most unusual day
There are people meeting people
There is sunshine everywhere
There are people greeting people
And a feeling of spring in the air
It's a most unusual time
I keep feeling my temperature climb
If my heart won't behave
In the usual way
There is only one thing to say
It's a most unusual
Most unusual
Most unusual day
Gee, that was nice, Judy.
Thanks, Oogie. What do you think, Carol?
Well, it's a very cute
little swing number, Judy...
...but frankly, I think it's a bit juvenile
for a senior high school dance.
Judy. Why do you ask her for anyway?
You know my sister
never approves of anything.
Please be quiet. Carol is talking.
Yes, go on, Carol.
Hey, now, wait a minute.
Who's directing this, anyway?
- Carol is, of course.
- Well, naturally.
Women.
Try singing the number slower, Judy.
More seductively.
And a scarf might give you
something to do with your hands.
Like this, follow me.
It's a most
Unusual day
Feel like throwing
My worries away
As an old native-born
Californian would say
It's a most
Unu...
Jo-Jo, that is not the place
for the cymbal crash.
Carol, what does she have to
hang on to a handkerchief for?
- You'd think she had hay fever.
- Don't be rude.
But this is supposed to be
a swing number.
- As I was saying...
- Judy, don't pay any attention to her.
Last week you were Kathryn Grayson.
This week you're Hildegard.
Couldrt you be just
plain Judy Foster for tonight?
If you don't like the way I sing, Oogie,
you can use my understudy, Mitzi.
All right, Judy, have it your own way.
You always do, anyway.
Here, you may as well take this too.
After all, Oogie, someone has to
supervise us or we'd be here all night.
I gotta call Mother.
I'll be back in a minute.
CAROL:
Hurry back, Judy.
The things a man has to put up with.
Yes, Judy, your dress came.
Yes, it's lovely, Judy.
Nightingale is pressing it now.
Well, you better hurry home.
It's almost time for dinner.
All right, dear.
- Feeling better, Melvin?
- Yes, a little bit.
You should see Dr. Lippincott
about some glasses.
Oh, nonsense.
My eyes are just as good now
as the day I met you.
Ooh.
- Hi, Dad. Hi, Mom.
- Hi.
Do you have to sneak
into the house like that, Randolph?
Why don't you blow a siren?
- Your father has a headache.
- Yes, I have a headache.
What he needs is glasses.
Swing low, sweet chariot
Coming for to carry me home
Swing low
Dora, can't you teach her another song?
- She's a very good cook, Melvin.
- Yeah.
Hey, Mom, would you ask Father
if I could have 50 cents?
Dora, will you tell your son
that he may not have 50 cents?
Bad timing, Randolph.
- Hello, Father. Hello, Mother.
- Hi, darling.
Do you have to slam the door
like that, Judy?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Look, I've got an orchid.
- Your father's got a headache.
- What he needs is glasses.
My eyes are just as good
as a 1 6-year-old boy's.
Well, Jo-Jo Hoffenpepper's only 1 5
and he can't see a thing.
I'm sure Oogie would be upset
if he saw you wearing his orchid now.
It will be dead before the dance.
That's when you have acid
in your system or something.
I'll never get dinner on, Mrs. Foster,
if you don't get Gramps out of my kitchen.
- Here, take over, Judy.
- All right.
- Father...
- Mm-hm.
...l've been thinking.
No, what now?
Well, Mitzi wears false eyelashes.
Could I wear false eyelashes tonight?
- No, you may not.
- I'll sell you mine for a dime.
Father, you're going to have
to do something about Randolph.
- What do you want us to do, drown him?
- Somebody drowned?
No, Gramps. Not yet, anyway.
- Doorbell's ringing, Dora.
RANDOLPH: Uh-uh. Telephone.
I'm gonna have
that telephone disconnected.
Oh, Mother, say something to Father.
- Hello, Father.
- Hello, Mother.
The Pringle butler on the wire
for Miss Foster.
He says it's very urgent.
Matter of life or death, no doubt.
Dinner's ready whenever you are.
Why can't we have a butler
like the Pringles do?
Why can't we be civilized?
One more word about the Pringles
or the oxblood nail polish...
...or the long eyelashes
and I'm going to forget that I'm civilized.
- Oh, Father.
- Oh, brother.
Oh, Jameson.
Yes, Jameson? I'll wait.
- Miss Foster on the phone.
- Thank you, Jameson.
Judy, dear,
I thought you'd like to know...
...that Xavier Cugat accepted my invitation
to the dance tonight.
He seemed very pleased when I told him
that he'd be guest of honor.
Oh, now, Judy, as for your dress
for tonight, what are you wearing?
You have a new dress?
It's blue?
Judy, dear, don't you think
your pink would be more appropriate?
Your complexion really calls for pink.
It brings out the freshness
and charm of your youth.
That's fine.
I knew you would agree with me.
Au revoir for now.
Miss, your father called to say
he'll not be home for dinner.
Thank you.
A very smart man.
Ogden, I think it's up to you
to find Father and talk to him.
I don't think he'd remember me.
Tell him it would be a good strategic move
for him to come to the dance.
It'd promote goodwill
with his depositors.
Now, how am I gonna find Father,
eat dinner...
...and pick up Judy
all in time for the dance?
Simple, Ogden, you don't eat.
Don't eat?
lturbi never eats before a concert.
I'm not lturbi. I'm Oogie, remember?
And besides, what about Judy?
I gotta pick her up.
Ogden, it's a fundamental law
of human nature...
...that women are always
more attracted to men who ignore them.
OGDEN:
I don't think Judy knows that law.
Well, of course she doesn't.
You spoil her.
- You shouldn't do that.
- I shouldn't?
And you should never have
given her an orchid.
Now she'll expect one every week.
- She will?
- Naturally.
You've set a very high standard.
It's hard to live up to it.
Well, golly, Carol, what am I gonna do?
Don't let her know you're so interested.
Take tonight, for instance.
Let somebody else call for her.
Be indifferent.
Do you really think so, Carol?
Of course.
I'll arrange for someone to call for her.
Then, when she sees you again...
...she'll be so relieved,
she'll probably fall right in your arms.
Hm.
She's never done that before.
How do I look?
You look lovely, dear.
But what about the new dress?
Yeah, the one that was so vital.
Oh, blue does nothing for me.
Oh, now, wait a minute.
For the last six weeks, I've heard nothing
but how important it was...
...that you should have a new dress
for this dance tonight.
Now that you have it,
you're not going to wear it.
Why?
It would be very difficult
to explain to you.
And I'm sure it would take
too much time.
- Come on, Melvin.
- All right, all right.
- You're coming along with us, honey?
- Oh, Father, really.
Why, if I walked in there with my parents
I'd be the laughingstock.
How do you like that?
Well, maybe we had better
wear a disguise.
Oh, Father.
Sometimes I think
you don't understand a thing about women.
It's time you and Gramps
had a heart-to-heart talk.
You wait for Oogie, dear,
and make a grand entrance.
- Have a good time.
JUD Y: I will.
MELVIN: Goodbye, son.
RANDOLPH: So long.
Maybe I should have worn a girdle.
What do you got to hold in?
Oh, Randolph.
Judy...
...if I didn't know better I'd swear
your grandmother was standing there.
Why, she used to wear a pink dress
just like that.
While you're waiting,
would you do your old Gramps a favor?
Of course, Gramps.
Your favorite?
Through the years
I'll take my place beside you
Smiling through the years
Through your tears
I keep my place beside you
Smiling through your tears
- I'll be near
- I'll be near
- No matter when or where
- No matter when or where
Remember
What is mine I'll always share
I'll come to you
Smiling through
The years
Thank you, darling, that was nice.
Telephones,
ought to be a law against them.
It's the doorbell, Gramps.
Will you get it? I can make an entrance.
- You look mighty pretty, Miss Judy.
JUD Y: Thanks, Nightingale.
Now, Judy?
Now, Gramps.
- Evening, Oogie.
- I'm not Oogie. I'm Jo-Jo.
GRAMPS:
Oh, Jo-Jo, come in.
- Jo-Jo's here, Judy.
- Jo-Jo?
- What are you doing here?
- I came to take you to the dance.
What?
- Where's Oogie?
- He's busy.
Busy?
You mean...
You mean, he expects me, Judy Foster...
...to go to the high school closing dance
with a mere child?
- An infant, a half-pint?
- I'm taking vitamins.
Oogie can't do this to me.
I won't stand for it.
- You mean, you don't wanna go with me?
- No, I don't.
Can I go now?
Why... Why, how dare you.
You should be thrilled to have a date
with an older woman.
Thrilled, she says.
I've got to use this phone.
It's an emergency.
So is this. I'm trying to borrow
Peewee Finnegars electric worm finder.
Oh, Randolph.
- Randolph, give me that phone.
- Four bits and it's yours.
Of all the mercenary, money-grabbing...
Hello, Peewee?
- Evening, Judy.
- Hello, Pop.
JUD Y:
Mr. Pringle?
This is to inform you that our friendship,
as of tonight, is dissolved.
You can have your class pin back.
And I'm sending at my earliest convenience
your 1 2 boogie-woogie records.
Is anything wrong?
Why do men always say,
"Is anything wrong?"
Yes, somebody came for me.
Jo-Jo Hoffenpepper indeed.
Why didn't you just send a midget?
Anything wrong, Judy?
Oh, just everything, Pop. Everything.
Oh, now, you look beautiful.
In high heels too.
An inch and a half.
Next year I'm gonna have 2 inches,
that is if I live that long.
Oh, now, what you need
is a strawberry parfait.
What I need is the date
for the dance tonight.
- Pop, who's that?
- Uh?
Oh, that's Stephen Andrews,
my nephew.
Oh, he's wonderful.
Yeah, he's late.
- Is he married?
POP: No, he's not married.
- Is he engaged?
- Yes, to me, for the summer.
Do you think that maybe he could, um...?
You sit right there and don't you move.
I'll wait. I won't move an inch.
I wonder if you'd do me a little favor?
Why, sure, Pop. What is it?
Well, how would you like to take
a beautiful young lady to a dance?
You call that a favor? Who is she?
Well, she's a friend of mine.
An old friend. That is,
we've known each other a long time.
Where is she?
Right there.
- You mean... You mean that youngster?
- Shh.
Now, wait a minute, she's only a child.
I'd look great taking her to a dance.
Now, Stephen, this is important.
Her heart's breaking.
You got a kid sister, you know
how tragic something like this can be.
Now, besides, I promised her.
Come on.
All right, Pop, you win.
But it's against my better judgment.
And if I send out an SOS,
I'll expect your help.
GRAMPS :
It's a most unusual day
Gramps.
Nobody's gonna stand up
my granddaughter. No, sirree.
Oh, you're a lamb.
I'll take you to the dance
and fetch you home.
And if they play a polka,
I'll even dance with you.
Oh, thanks, Gramps,
but I think that maybe I have a date.
POP:
You have, Judy.
Stephen, Judy.
- Hello, Judy.
- Hello. Gramps, this is Stephen.
Glad to know you, Gramps.
Always tell a mars character
the way he shakes.
Thank you, sir.
We'd better hurry, Stephen.
I don't wanna miss a minute of the dance.
Goodbye, Gramps. Bye, Mr. Scully.
Oh, dear.
- How about a cherry phosphate?
- Don't mind if I do.
Got anything to put a little sting in it?
Hey, Jo-Jo, take over for me
for a minute, will you?
Look.
Don't worry, Oogie.
Everything will be all right.
Yeah, and in the meantime,
I'm a bachelor.
Melvin, who's Judy dancing with?
I can't tell at this distance.
Well, you need glasses, Mr. Foster.
My eyes are perfect.
Judy, hey.
I think the orchestra leader
is trying to attract your attention, Judy.
Ignore it.
He's just someone I used to know
in my childhood.
Ladies and gentlemen...
...our popular 1 6-year-old singer,
Miss Judy Foster...
...will sing for you now.
That's despicable, that's what it is.
It's despicable.
He knows that I'm practically 1 7.
Any man who'd reveal a womars age
should be horsewhipped.
Would you?
I'd much rather hear you sing, Judy.
All right, Stephen.
But only because you want me to.
Your pin, Mr. Pringle.
Oh, Judy, please don't be mad at me.
I meant to pick you up.
Honest I did, but I had other things to do.
And besides, I ought to be mad at you,
coming in here late with some other guy.
Kindly, play the introduction
to "Love Is Where You Find lt."
You can't sing that tonight, Judy.
"Love Is Where You Find lt"...
...is the song you're gonna sing
on your parents' anniversary.
Oogie, "Love Is Where You Find lt."
Very well.
"Love Is Where You Find lt."
Love is where you find it
Don't be blind
It's all around you everywhere
Take it, take a chance now
For romance now
Tell a someone that you care
Spring love comes upon you
When it's gone you feel despair
Soon, though, in the moon glow
You'll find that a new love is there
Love is where you find it
Fate designed it
To be waiting everywhere
It may hide from you for a while
It may come tonight in a smile
And a plea for the new love
In the arms of a new love
Seek and you shall
Find
Love is where you find it
Don't be blind, it's all around you
Everywhere
Everywhere
Judy, isn't there something I can do
to make up with you?
Yes, Mr. Pringle...
...you may borrow
some of Jo-Jo's vitamins.
Did you like my song, Stephen?
I thought it was wonderful.
I think you're swell.
- Oh, you're magnificent. Have some punch.
- Thank you.
Judy, you didn't sing the song
that we rehearsed this afternoon.
Oh, I'm sorry, Carol.
But I had to sing a special song
for a special person.
Oh, Stephen, this is Carol Pringle.
Carol, this is Stephen.
- How do you do?
- Hello, Carol.
Judy, dear, it's time
for Mr. Cugat to arrive.
You'd better be in the door
to welcome him.
- Well, l...
- Run along. Business comes first.
I'll be right back.
Don't you go away.
Don't worry, Judy. I'll be right here.
I have a few moments to spare
if you'd care to dance.
Oh, that's very generous of you.
I don't believe I know who you are.
I'm sure you don't.
- But I know who you are.
- You do?
You're the prettiest girl in Santa Barbara.
That's obvious.
Well, thank you very much.
And you know it. That's also obvious.
That wasrt very nice, was it?
No, it wasrt. I'm sorry.
You spending the summer here?
I think most of it will be spent
at Scully's drug store.
Better come in sometime
and sample a malted milk.
I never drink malt.
And now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm in charge of the program.
Judy, won't you listen to me
for just a minute?
Please don't talk to me.
I've just renounced you.
But I don't wanna be renounced.
I want you to wear my pin.
In fact, I'm going to erase
your name from my diary.
You know, Judy, sometimes
I think you don't like me at all.
- Good evening.
- Oh, Mr. Cugat.
I thought maybe
I got in the wrong place, no?
Oh, no, this is the right place.
Come with me.
I'll introduce you around.
- There's some other old people here too.
- Oh?
Who's the young man Judy's with?
His name's Stephen Andrews.
He works at Scully's drugstore.
Nice-looking fellow.
Yes, I supposed one might say that he is.
I'm sorry my father isn't here tonight.
He promised he'd try to come.
Well, you know how businessmen are.
Sometimes it's very hard to find time
to go to a high school dance.
You always seem to find time,
Mr. Foster.
Oh, that's because I guess I'm curious.
I want to know what's going on.
I think it's very nice...
...having someone who wants
to know what's going on.
Just the opposite in our family.
My father never knows what's going on.
Of course, he's extremely busy man.
MELVIN:
Oh, of course he is, yes.
Sometimes I wish...
Sometimes I wish he werert so busy.
Will you excuse me?
I'm sure Ogden needs me.
Mr. Cugat, this is my mother and father,
Mr. and Mrs. Foster.
How do you do, Mr. Cugat?
Nice to meet you.
Hello, Mr. Cugat. Wort you sit down?
Thank you, I will.
My daughter, Judy,
is a great admirer of yours.
- So is her mother.
- Well, thank you, thank you.
That's a charming compliment
from two very charming ladies.
They're playing that especially for you,
Mr. Cugat.
Melvin.
Arert you going to dance with me?
What? A man of my age get out there...
...and make a fool of himself
like those jack-in-the-boxes?
Well, you could do
a more dignified version, dear.
Dora, look, I've been a faithful husband
to you for 1 9 years, haven't I?
Twenty. It's our anniversary next week.
Remember, dear?
- A good provider?
- Yes.
- Satisfactory father to the children?
- Yes.
Then please don't ask me to rumba.
If you don't mind, Señor Foster...
...perhaps your wife
will do the rumba with me?
Oh, sure, go ahead and ask her.
You won't have to coax her.
Thank you, Mr. Cugat. I'd love it.
It's a shame
Mother has to dance by herself.
- Judy?
- Yes, Father?
I don't wanna hear another word
about me learning to do that rumba.
Yes, Father.
But I would like to hear who
the young man was you were dancing with.
Well, that's my dream man.
What about Oogie?
Oh, I just gave him up forever
for a little while.
- Oh, I see.
- Would you like to meet Stephen?
Well, I believe it's customary.
If you can get him away
from Mitzi there.
So that's what happens
when my back is turned.
Excuse me, Father.
Mitzi, dear, Oogie wants you.
Oh, well, tell him I'm busy right now.
Mitzi, Oogie wants you now.
Oh, thank you, Stephen.
It's just been wonderful.
I'll be right back.
You do wanna dance with me,
don't you, Stephen?
It would be a pleasure, Judy.
Where's Mrs. Foster?
Out there dancing the rumba
with Mr. Cugat.
Oh.
Kind of a vulgar dance,
don't you think?
I can't do it either.
Mrs. Foster,
you are what we call muy guapa.
- Oh. Is that good?
- Well, in my language...
...it means terrific.
- Oh.
Oh, I'd spend the rest of my life
singing for you, Stephen.
I don't think Oogie
would like that very well.
- Oogie brought this all on himself.
- All right.
But don't be too rough on him.
He's a nice guy.
Good night.
Thank you for a very nice evening.
JUD Y: Good night, Stephen,
and thank you for a very nice evening.
- Well, good night.
- Stephen...
...do you think a girl should let a boy
kiss her on their first date?
I most certainly do not.
- Not even...
- Not even then, Judy.
Good night...
...sweet 1 6.
Almost 1 7.
If I'd taken Judy to the dance tonight,
that malt mixer wouldn't have taken her.
And if he hadrt taken her,
she wouldn't have met him.
And I wouldn't be miserable
like I am now.
I'm sure Mr. Andrews realizes
the obvious difference in their ages.
Maybe so. But does Judy?
She even kissed him.
She did?
I've known her all my life.
She's never kissed me,
except on birthdays.
He's better looking than I am too.
Does she really mean that much to you?
Sure she does.
She's real fine.
Oh, why didn't he fall for you
instead of my girl?
You haven't any heart, that's all.
I have a heart, Oogie.
It's just that I haven't had
much chance to use it.
Like...
...neither one of us
has had much chance.
I don't have anyone to talk to.
You don't have anyone to talk to.
I guess we just have
to talk to each other.
Oh, I wish Mother were here.
Me too.
I'll take care of everything, Oogie.
Oh, no, look, Carol, l...
I said I'd take care of everything.
OGDEN:
Good night.
Swing low, sweet chariot
Coming for to carry me home
She's going to swing so low,
they're going to have to carry me home.
Now, Melvin.
Your breakfast is getting cold, dear.
- Breakfast?
- That's right, breakfast.
Yeah, we're different than most families.
We have breakfast in the morning,
lunch at lunchtime and dinner at...
Never mind, Randolph.
Drink your orange juice, dear.
What did you say, Father?
I didn't a say a word,
it was your mother who just spoke.
- What's the matter with you, anyway?
- Hm?
Melvin, see if you can get through to her.
I'll try, Dora. It might take a little time.
Judy? Judy Foster.
Good morning, Father.
Good morning, dear ones.
RANDOLPH:
Whee! You got through.
Judy, did you and Oogie make up?
My heart belongs to Stephen.
I think we have a lead.
Where did you meet Stephen, dear?
I met him in a prescription booth.
Ah, he's a soda jerk.
I'm sorry, this household just isn't
big enough for both Randolph and me.
Eventually, one of us has to go.
Father, you'll have to make the choice.
Well, Dora, what do you think?
You have a preference?
Well, it's something
we can't decide in a hurry.
I think we ought to have at least
until tomorrow morning.
Now you're making fun of me.
You never take anything I say seriously.
Yes, we do, darling.
But having to make a choice between
you and Randolph is serious indeed.
Now sit down and eat your breakfast.
Why, there's a picture of Mr. Cugat.
- I hadrt seen it.
- What you need is glasses.
Dr. Lippincott can fix you up.
Oh. Ha-ha.
Yeah. Oh, he hasn't changed
since last night.
You know, he's a very romantic man.
He said I was muy guapa.
- What?
- Oh, that's a compliment.
Wow, look at that
prized string of palominos he's got.
Oh, that's nothing. I can have my face
splashed on there anytime.
Father, you'd look perfectly ridiculous
standing beside a string of mackerel.
And he dances divinely.
He should.
That's his business.
My business is canning fish.
If you really loved me, Melvin,
you'd learn how to rumba.
Oh, what is my loving you
got to do with that ridiculous dance?
Nothing, Melvin.
Except that when I go to dances,
I like to dance...
...and I like to dance with my husband.
That reminds me, the drug store is open.
Bye, everybody.
Where's Judy? Why didn't she
come down for breakfast?
Nothing like a quiet breakfast
with the Fosters, is there?
- Melvin?
- Mm-hm?
I love you.
Even if you can't rumba like Mr. Cugat.
Muy guapa sounds like birdseed.
How was the dance?
It was fine. I met a lot of nice people.
Say, Pop, do you know a girl
by the name of Carol Pringle?
Sure, sure.
Everybody knows the Pringles.
She never comes in here, though.
Not since she grew out
of her bobby socks, anyway.
CAROL:
Good morning, Mr. Scully.
Met a lot of nice people, huh?
Hello, Miss Pringle.
I haven't seen you for some time.
How's your father?
Well, he's fine, thank you.
Anything I can do for you?
I thought perhaps Judy would be here.
I wanted to talk to her.
Well, she isn't here,
but I'm reasonably sure she will be.
Hello.
Hello.
Didrt know I was artistic, did you?
I know very little about you.
Go ahead, eat it.
There ought to be more
fancy ice cream sundaes in everybody's life.
- Thanks.
- Hi, Carol.
- Hello, Stephen.
- Hello, Judy.
- That looks yummy.
- Would you like it?
No, thanks. I came to talk to Stephen.
What are you doing here?
Well, I wanted to talk to you, Judy.
I thought I'd find you here.
I finally convinced Father to let you
and Oogie try out on his radio station.
You did? Oh, that's stinky super.
Of course,
it's only a sustaining program...
...but undoubtedly you can get
your father to sponsor it.
My father seems to think that his fish
can get along very well without my help.
Oh, but I'm sure your voice
would double his sales, Judy.
Gee, I don't know.
Why don't you go
and talk to him about it?
Maybe he will see it our way, Carol.
I'll go right away.
Don't go away, I'll be right back.
So long, Judy.
- Cute as a button, isn't she?
- Judy's a charming child.
It's nice to see a young girl act her age.
Yes, and 1 6 is such a nice age to be.
Oh. You remember.
You are amusing, Stephen.
Oh, by the way, I thought perhaps
you'd like to drop around for dinner tonight.
You've talked me into it.
- Shall we say 7:00?
- Seven o'clock.
Why, Carol, you've hardly touched a bite.
- Don't you like it?
- Oh, of course.
That's what I like to see,
a girl with a healthy appetite.
Hi, Carol.
- Hi, Carol.
- Oh, give me one of those, will you?
This is Mr. Foster's office, yes?
- And you are Miss Rosita.
- That's right.
Come in.
- Mr. Foster is expecting you.
- Good.
Mr. Foster, this is Miss Rosita.
MELVIN: How do you do, Miss Rosita?
- How do you do?
Thank you, Miss Clarke, and please see
that we're not disturbed for about an hour.
Yes, Mr. Foster.
I really don't know
how to explain this to you, but l...
You want to rumba, yes? That is it, huh?
Well, not exactly. I really don't want...
Well, yes, I do want to.
You see, Mr. Cugat told me
that you could teach me.
- Do you think you could?
- Of course I can.
I'm not the ballroom type.
I spent most of my life at sea
on these here fishing boats.
They didn't do much
rumba dancing there.
Mr. Foster, I put you in my hands.
You watch me
and I show you the beginning steps.
You see, it is just a matter of a little
wiggle here and a little wiggle there.
You have to get the right wiggle
at the right place and at the right time.
Everything will be fine. I'll show you.
Watch me.
See, the only way to learn is to do it.
Come on.
Now turn this way.
Good. Now this way.
Turn this way.
That's it.
See?
Oh, Miss Clarke, I've got to see Father.
Judy, I'm very sorry.
Your father is busy, very busy.
- But this is vital.
- What your father is doing is also vital.
- Is he in conference?
- Oh, not exactly.
I'll bet he's asleep.
Judy. Your father is not in habit
of sleeping during business hours.
Well, if he's not asleep,
what else can he be doing?
- I've got to see him.
- Well, just let me announce you.
Oh, Mr. Foster, your daughter is here.
She says it's very important.
All right.
- Just a second, Judy.
- Thank you.
That's a pretty dress you're wearing.
Lovely color.
- Well, seconds up. Thanks.
- But, Judy...
Miss Clarke said you were busy,
but you don't look very busy to me.
I am very busy. Thinking, Judy, thinking.
I'm glad you're thinking because I have
something I want you to think about.
You always do. What is it now?
Well, you see,
Carol talked to her father...
...and her father said that maybe
my father would sponsor a program...
...on his radio station
so Oogie and I can be on the air.
Well, I thought
that you and Oogie had split up.
Well, this is strictly business.
Carol said it will double your sale of fish.
Now, Judy, my fish are doing
just dandy without any radio advertising...
...and I might add,
without the advice of Carol.
I was only trying to help your fish.
I appreciate that, and the fish do too.
- But, Father, if we...
- Now, now, now.
You run along home
and we'll take it up later. Come on.
But I can't go home, Father.
I have a very important day
at the drug store.
Well, then, you run on to the drug store.
Goodbye, Judy.
Goodbye.
Oh, Miss Rosita, I want to apologize.
I didn't have time...
Mr. Foster,
my profession is an honorable one.
You engaged me to teach you the rumba,
don't you?
And I do not teach in closets.
Oh, well, wait, wait. Oh, listen.
Oh, please, Miss Rosita, please.
That was my daughter
that was just in here.
And if she saw you,
that would spoil everything.
What do you mean, spoil everything?
I thought you're a respectable man.
Oh, I am, honest. Believe me, I am.
You see, I'm doing this for my family.
- It's a great big surprise.
- What surprise?
Well, next week, my wife and I
are celebrating our wedding anniversary.
For years, she's wanted me
to learn how to rumba and it's for her.
Oh, so that is it, huh? When you say
you celebrate this anniversary?
- Next week.
- Next week.
All right, I stay.
But remember, if I teach
in any more closets, I raise the price.
And with you
I'm starting from behind scratch.
Oh, that's your daughter, no?
No, my wife.
But she looks so young.
You know something?
You too would look 1 0 years younger,
if you did not dress so stuffy.
- Stuffy?
- Si, look at that tie here.
So tired. Throw him away.
And that tummy, that should go too.
Well, never mind.
We'll get rid of them dancing.
With a beautiful wife like this,
you better be on your toes, you know.
- She is beautiful, isn't she, huh?
- Yeah.
Now we come into the business, huh?
Let's try again. Chin up.
Waist in.
Shoulders back. Chest out.
Come now.
One, two, three, hip.
One, two, three, hip.
Watch the hip.
- One, two...
- I am, lady, I am.
Then go ahead. Do it.
One, two, three, hip.
One, two, three, hip. That's it.
One, two, three, hip. One...
That's right, Jameson.
We'll use candlelight.
Yes, miss, candlelight.
And two martinis, Jameson.
One with alcohol and one without.
Oh, but don't forget the olive.
Uh, no, miss.
After dinner,
you may build a fire in the fireplace.
I beg your pardon, miss,
but I think it's a bit warm for a fire.
Then we'll open the windows.
Yes, miss.
Oh, thank you.
After we have our demitasse,
you may take the rest of the evening off.
Oh, yes, miss. I understand.
Good evening, sir.
Oh, good evening, Miss Judy.
Hi, Jameson. Tell Miss Carol that I'm here
and that Mr. Andrews is too.
Yes, miss. Would you just wait
in the living room, please?
I beg your pardon, miss.
Mr. Andrews is here and Miss Judy.
- Judy?
- Yes, miss.
You'll have to set another place, quickly.
I don't think the pheasant
will stretch three ways.
Give Mr. Andrews the neck.
- Yes, miss.
- And you better forget about the martinis.
Yes, miss.
- Hello.
STEPHEN: Good evening.
Judy, how wonderful to see you,
both of you.
It was so nice of you
to invite us to dinner.
I'm so glad you could come.
What's the matter? Is something wrong?
- Oh, where's Oogie?
- He won't be here for dinner.
- He won't?
- He won't?
CAROL:
He'll be here later.
Just because he lives here,
I don't see why he should always be here.
Dinner is served, Miss Carol.
Thank you, Jameson. Shall we?
We thank you for this food...
...and for the privilege of eating it together
and in peace. Amen.
- Telephone's ringing, Nightingale.
- It's the door, Gramps.
Doorbells, phone bells,
bells is always ringing.
And the doors and bells and everything.
Hello, Nightingale.
Lan sakes.
Oogie, how is it
you always manage to get here...
...just when everybody's eating dinner.
Oh, it's no trouble at all.
- Hello, Oogie.
- Hello, Mrs. Foster, everybody.
- Hi.
- You lose something, Oogie?
Oh, no, nothing at all.
- Will you have dinner with us, Oogie?
- Sure, thank you.
- Isn't Judy here?
- No, Judy won't be here for dinner.
- She's having dinner with your sister.
- She is?
So that's why she wanted me
to eat at the drugstore.
Yeah, she wanted me to leave
so that she could talk to Judy.
If I were at the house,
she couldn't talk to Judy...
...so therefore she asked me to leave.
See what I mean?
No, I don't see what you mean.
I'll take your word for it, though.
That must be it.
Sure, she's fixing everything up.
Yes, sir, that's it.
- Doorbell.
- Wrong again, Gramps, telephone.
If I don't pay the telephone bill,
how soon will they take it out?
Now, Melvin.
Mr. Pringle,
you're wanted on the telephone.
Oh, thanks. You see, it's just like I told you.
Excuse me.
Randolph, what language does he speak?
For 25 cents, I'll translate it.
OGDEN:
Yeah? She is?
She did? She has?
She does? Yeah-hoo!
I'll be right home.
I take it back.
I have to have 50 cents to translate that.
JUD Y :
Love is where you find it
Don't be blind
It's all around you everywhere
Spring love comes upon you
When it's gone, you feel despair
- Hi, Oogie. Glad to see you.
- Hi.
- Hi, Judy. Why did you stop?
- The mood's been broken.
Seems to me you're getting
awfully moody lately.
CAROL:
Sit down, Oogie.
Holy jeepers.
Who wants a fire on a night like this?
I find it cozy.
Very cozy.
How cozy can you get?
I don't see how I can possibly
do a radio program with him.
- He's impossible.
- What radio program?
JUD Y: The one Carol fixed for us to do
on your father's station.
OGDEN: I don't know anything about it.
I'll bet father doesn't.
He won't even let me
inside the station.
If Carol says it's all right, it's all right.
Why don't you and Oogie
run through your number.
- You could use it for the initial broadcast.
- I don't feel like it.
- She just wants to be coaxed.
- Please do, Judy, I'd like to hear it.
You would?
Well, all right, then.
Let's proceed, Oogie.
When I was just a little girl
A long, long time ago
I promised me I'd grow to be
A woman of the world
But fate plays many funny tricks
It did to me, I know
And as Jimmy Durante puts it
I've been foiled
I'm strictly on the corny side
Corny side, corny side
I'm strictly on the corny side
But the boys like me that way
I never go for city chicks
I can't mix, got no tricks
But put me with the cows and chicks
And you'll find that I'm not hay
- I'm a real hillbilly
- The gals go silly
A willy-nilly when I roll my eyes
- You're a real humdinger
- Don't you point your finger
I just do it for the exercise
We're strictly on the corny side
Corny side, corny side
We're strictly on the corny side
And the folks like us that way
I used to dream of being quite a siren
With cavaliers bedecking me with jewels
I'd have a yacht
A foreign car to drive in
But now I drive a pair of seven mules
I used to wanna be a wealthy broker
With secretaries sitting on my knee
I guess I'll wind up being just a joker
Shaking apples from an apple tree
We're strictly on the corny side
Corny side, corny side
We're strictly on the corny side
And that's the place to be
You can have the city
You can save your pity
For the folks who run around and scream
Oh, the country's quiet
Come along and try it
Down by the Old Mill stream
- We're strictly on the corn
- We're strictly on the corny side
Corny side, corny side
We're strictly on the corny side
And that's the place to be
Thank you, Judy.
Better run through it again, though.
I think we should leave them alone
while they rehearse.
OGDEN: Yeah, and there's a terrific moon
out tonight.
The moon has nothing to do with it,
Ogden.
I can hear you from out here.
OGDEN:
Please don't go. I'd like to talk to you.
Go ahead, talk.
Don't you like me anymore, Judy?
Of course I do, Oogie.
But there comes a time when people
must find the way of their hearts.
And follow their hearts.
I know the way in my heart.
I know that someday
when I'm through school and have a job...
...well, then I'm gonna
ask you to marry me.
Jinkies,
if I have to wait for all that to happen...
...l'll be too old to marry.
Well, the least you can do when
a man asks you to marry him is be polite.
Mr. Pringle, I feel that I'm under
no obligation to you whatsoever...
...as far as marriage is concerned.
I'm an adult now
and I must conduct myself accordingly.
- What? Judy, are you hurt?
- You pushed me.
Pushed you?
How can you say such a thing?
Don't you ever speak to me again.
I should have pushed her.
Why did you bring Judy tonight,
Stephen?
She came back to the drugstore
this afternoon.
A lot of her girlfriends were there.
She said she had a date with me tonight.
- They said she didn't so l...
- So you said she did.
Well, you know how it is.
I can't say that I do.
Just how is it?
You're a funny girl.
You've got everything
any girl could possibly want.
You're beautiful.
It's almost too beautiful.
You have youth, education,
a lovely home.
With all these things, why do you
have to try so hard to impress people?
- Is that the way you feel about me?
- I'm afraid it is.
- Then I think you're very rude.
- And I think you're very spoiled.
I'm not interested in your personal opinion,
Mr. Andrews.
That's a good sign. It's the first time
I've seen you follow a natural impulse.
If I followed my natural impulse,
I'd push you in the flowerbed. Good night.
- Where's Judy?
- She's upstairs.
And will you tell her I didn't push her?
Women.
I know what you mean.
Look, Steve, you wouldn't take my girl
away from me, would you?
Why, you bet your life I wouldn't, Oogie.
I wouldn't have a chance
even if I wanted to.
No?
When a girl goes to all the trouble
Judy does to make you jealous...
...that's true love.
Gee, I never thought of that.
Steve, you're a man of the world.
Do you think Judy will be easier
to understand as she gets older?
Don't try to understand women, Oogie,
just accept them.
I guess that would be easier.
And, Oogie, would you mind taking
Judy home when she comes down?
- I gotta go back to work.
- Oh, glad to, Steve. Glad to.
- Tell Carol good night for me, will you?
- You bet. Come back again, Steve.
- Anytime, anytime at all.
- Thanks, Oogie.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Good night, Steve, old boy.
Oh, Jameson.
Could you fix me a double-decker
ham-and-cheese sandwich, please?
- I'll try, sir. And a glass of milk?
- Yeah.
Let's make it four-decker.
Four? Yes, sir.
Carol?
You know much more
about men than I do.
Tell me about them, will you?
There's little to tell, Judy.
If you know one man, you know them all.
Of course, Stephers different.
Stephers a man, Judy.
And once a person is a man,
there's nothing anyone can do about it.
Oh, I don't wanna do anything about it.
The pathetic part of it all
is they never improve with age.
In fact, they get worse.
Shakespeare once said,
"A man in his time plays many parts.
His acts being seven ages."
Of course, I never did see
eye-to-eye with Shakespeare.
As far as I'm concerned,
there are but three ages:
Youth, middle age and infirmity.
It's the middle age we have to be aware of
because that's the critical age.
Oh, but Stephers not middle-aged.
He isn't now, but he will be someday.
All men reach it.
My father did.
Believe me, Judy.
Then they are a problem.
Jinkies.
How do you know
when they reach that critical age?
Oh, by little things.
Sudden changes in their habits.
They start throwing money away like mad.
Maybe something as minor
as a sudden obsession for bright clothes.
In my father's case...
...it was a desire
for monogrammed silk shirts.
Oh, I had a terrible two years.
Oh, I think my father
skipped that critical age.
He doesn't do any of those things,
particularly throw money away.
But you never can tell, Judy.
Really?
With men, it can happen overnight.
One, two, three, shake hips.
One, two, three, shake hips.
One, two, three, shake hips.
One, two, three, shake hips.
Father.
Father, what are you doing up so late?
You should be in bed.
Oh, reading, just reading.
Trying to improve my mind.
But you never read
before you go to bed.
And it's so late.
Now, wait a minute, young lady.
I'm supposed
to ask the questions in this house.
What are you doing out so late?
Oogie took a shortcut and we got lost.
Oh, yeah.
I've heard that from before.
Time for you to go to bed, Judy.
Father, I'd like to ask you
a few questions if I may.
Sure, go ahead.
Please sit down.
Do you remember how you felt
when you first met Mother?
Sure, I felt fine.
Did you know right away
that you loved her?
Of course I did.
And did you tell her so?
Well, no, not right then.
After all, I didn't want her know
that I was that easy...
...so I just sort of let her tell me.
- Oh, I see.
- But, Judy...
...don't mention that to your mother,
will you, please?
And you were happy just to be alive,
werert you?
And the whole world seemed brighter...
...and music sounded much sweeter.
Oh, yes, I was happy.
And Mother got the same way.
I know, she did.
- She told me so.
- She did?
She did.
Hey, what are you driving at, anyway?
Well, Father...
...I feel the same way now
as Mother did when she first met you.
I'm in love. Terribly in love.
I want to get married.
Well, Judy, you're kind of young,
don't you think?
And Oogie, well, his allowance
isn't enough to support a wife on.
Oh, Father, I'm not talking about a child.
I'm talking about a man, Stephen.
Stephen Andrews.
Has he asked you?
No.
Of course, I haven't give him
any encouragement.
But I'm sure he feels the same way
about me as you did about Mother.
When the right time arrives...
...l'll ask him.
Well, Judy, you're just a little child.
But Mother was only 1 7
when she married you.
Well...
This is terribly serious. l...
Coming especially at this time
when I really need your help.
Oh, Father, you know if you need me,
I'll stay.
Well, I was thinking about
that there radio program of yours.
You know, a little advertising
might be of great help to me now.
If you're leaving,
you won't be of any help.
Father,
you know I'll always stand by you.
Even if it means working with Oogie.
My working with him
will have to be a strictly business basis.
Oh, naturally. Strictly business, of course.
Now you run on to bed
and we'll talk over again in a few days.
If you don't mind, I'd like to stay down
just a little while longer if I may.
I have so many things to think about.
So many, many things.
All right, you stay down here
a few minutes and think.
But if you don't come upstairs
in 1 0 minutes, I'm coming down...
...and carry you up piggyback,
like I used do before you grew up.
- Oh, Father.
- Good night, honey.
Good night, Father.
Dora.
- Dora.
- Hm?
Judy's in love.
Oh, that's nice.
Oogie must be happy.
Don't forget to wind the clock.
No, no, no. You don't know what I mean.
It isn't Oogie.
She's in love with Stephen.
Looks very serious.
What? Stephen?
- What are you...? You mean...
- That's what I mean.
Well, he couldn't be serious
or could he?
I don't know about him, but Judy is.
Oh, she's just a baby.
Well, I'm not so sure about that.
She informed me that she now feels
as you did when you first met me.
Oh, my.
Oh, my.
MAN: No bacon this morning. That new
specialist has eliminated pork for my diet.
Davis, I'll come down myself
and speak to them.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
What are you doing up so early?
You're not ill, are you?
- No, Father, I'm not ill.
- That's good.
- I wanted to talk to you.
- Hm?
I said, I wanted to talk to you.
What is it? New clothes?
Allowance overdrawn?
- Ogders not in trouble?
- No, Father.
JAMESON:
Your broker is on the wire, sir.
- I'd like to go away for a while.
- Hello, Grayson. Fine.
Change is beneficial. Where you going?
Now, have you sold those shares,
Grayson?
I don't know, Father.
Indecisiors a sign of weakness.
No, no, not you, Grayson, I'm talking
to my daughter. What about those shares?
The market broke
before you had a chance to sell?
Well, be in my office in half an hour
with the figures.
Yes.
Where's Carol?
- She's left, Mr. Pringle.
- She didn't touch her breakfast.
Well, people in love
rarely have much appetite, sir.
- In love. Who's in love?
- Miss Carol, I believe, sir.
Nonsense. Well, she only a child. She...
- What do you mean, in love?
- Just that, sir.
With whom? What does he do?
What's he's background?
His name is Stephen Andrews.
He works in Scully's drug store.
What? Wait a minute, Jameson. Did she say
something about wanting to go away?
Yeah, I believe she did, sir.
A sensible girl, Carol.
I'll speak to her myself.
You see what you can do about finding out
who this fellow is.
Yes, I'll do my best, sir.
LUCIEN:
About this trip, Carol.
I thought you might like
to go to your grandmother's.
Maine is very nice this time of the year.
I'm sure it is, Father.
But I changed my mind. I'm staying here.
Oh?
- And, Father?
- Yes, Carol.
You'll be happy to know...
...that American Tel and Tel
went up two points today.
- Good morning, Nightingale.
- Yes, I suppose it is.
Even in the morning, the door bells,
the phone bells.
This is the "bellingest" house
I've ever been in.
- Good morning, Oogie.
OGDEN: Hello, Nightingale.
How is it you always manage to get here
just when everybody's eating?
It's no trouble at all.
Good morning, Oogie. How are you
this beautiful glorious morning?
Fine, sir. I mean, I'm not fine.
It's just that I'm...
To tell you the truth,
I'm not fine at all.
Well, well, sit down
and tell me all about it, Oogie.
Well, it's like this, Mr. Foster.
I think your daughter
is losing interest in me.
Oh, well, you know how girls are, Oogie.
- No, sir, I don't. How are they?
- Well...
You have to keep
two jumps ahead of them.
Find out what they want
and then don't give it to them.
Later on, surprise them.
Always works, Oogie.
Gee, I can't seem to surprise Judy much.
Seem she always knows
what I'm gonna do before I do.
Well, that's because she's a Foster.
Always on her toes.
- Good Morning, Mr. Pringle.
- Oh, hi, Judy.
- Good morning, Father.
- Good morning, Judy, dear.
Father, you're wearing a new tie.
That's right, a new tie. You like it?
I think it's snazzy, Mr. Foster.
But it's so loud.
Well, so it's loud.
I got a dozen more just as loud.
But it's not like you at all.
Mm. Well, I'm a different person,
a new man.
After all, a man of my age is liable
to get into a rut.
Well, goodbye, Judy, dear.
Goodbye, Oogie.
You two kids try and get along together
and work out that there radio idea.
He didn't eat a thing.
- I brought the contract for the radio show...
- We'll have to see Father about it first.
We just saw him.
Mr. Pringle...
...we have a policy in our household.
We never discuss business at home.
We'll have to call on him at the office.
I'm doing pretty good, don't you think?
Magnificent, wonderful.
Somewhere in your family tree
must be hanging a Spaniard.
Let's go.
That's it. Now watch the hip.
- Watch the hip.
- Yeah, I am. I am.
- Hi, Miss Clarke, I wanna see Father.
- You'll have to wait. Your father's busy.
That's what you told me yesterday
and the day before.
- I thought this was the slack season.
- Business is picking up.
Oh, but I've got to see him,
it's terribly vital.
Hello.
Judy is on her way in. Hold her a minute.
It will be just a minute.
I don't see what difference
one little minute makes. Do you?
Judy.
MELVIN:
Well, Judy.
My own little Judy.
Of course, Father. Who else is?
- What brings you two here?
- We came about the radio program.
Oh, yes, of course.
Oogie's drawn up a contract
he wants you to sign.
He's gonna be a Supreme Court justice.
Sign here.
Well, Judy, I'd never sign anything
before I read it.
Now you two run along.
Well, it's nothing tricky, Mr. Foster.
Just seven years.
Oh, with options.
MELVIN:
Seven years?
Well, what if your voice changes?
Now, here, Judy...
...you take that and buy yourself
a new dress for the radio show.
- Buy a dress, Father?
- Yeah, and get yourself some shoes...
...or buy anything that you want to.
But run along.
- Are you sure you feel all right?
- Oh, I feel fine.
OGDEN:
He looks fine to me.
Sure. Fine.
Father, how old are you?
Well, I'm just half as old
as you think I am, Judy.
- Run along, go on up to the store.
- I think he wants us to go.
- Get yourself a lot of clothes.
- It's happened.
- Huh?
- Men, beasts. I hate you all.
- Golly, Judy, what did I do?
- Nothing yet, but you will.
- Why?
- Because you're a man.
One of us must be crazy, Judy.
Frankly, I'm bewildered.
From now on,
don't you ever speak to me again.
Very well, Miss Foster.
I'll see you at rehearsal at 4.
Purely as maestro and vocalist.
I'm a very patient man,
but I've reached the end of my rope.
Miss Clarke...
...do you have trouble with men?
Just getting them, that's all.
For goodness sakes, Oogie, stop pacing.
You'll wear yourself out.
How can you have a rehearsal
with nobody to rehearse with.
- Oh, maybe she isn't coming?
- Judy will be here.
Well, where is she?
I'm the last man in the world
who would know where Judy Foster is.
OGDEN:
Well, good afternoon, Miss Foster.
You know that we have a radio show
to do on Tuesday morning?
Yes, I know, Oogie. I'm ready.
Okay, kids, let's hit it.
Presenting The Foster Fish Program.
Spend each Tuesday morn at 8
With Judaline
Don't forget you've got a date
With Judaline
Like an angel out of space
Golden hair and a classic face
Nothing like her anyplace
Man, she's really fine
I love the charming way you speak
On Judaline
It brings the color to the cheeks
On Judaline
Although you mean
All the things you've said
You're embarrassing me instead
No one person could be so divine
Lovely as a summer breeze
It is Judaline
Makes me wonder if these charms
Are really mine
If I'm all the things that you see in me
Where's the me that I used to be?
Where is Judy?
You mean Judaline
'Coz I spend my life in being
Judaline
Golly, now what did I do?
This time, Oogie,
I think I'm the one who's at fault.
I'll talk to her.
Judy...
...what's the matter?
Oh, I can't tell you, Carol.
I can't tell anybody.
Come on and sit down.
Don't you trust me, Judy?
Of course I trust you, Carol.
It's just that...
I think men are awful.
Even the ones you think are wonderful...
...turn out to be just like the ones
you think aren't wonderful.
Please forgive me, Judy.
I don't know how it happened.
I didn't want it to.
It just did.
I didn't think it was possible to fall in love
with anyone so fast.
I wanted so to tell someone.
There wasrt anyone to tell.
Anyway, I don't think he even likes me.
What are you talking about, Carol?
Stephen.
- Werert you?
- No, I wasrt.
If I hadrt decided just this morning
to put men completely out of my life...
...l'd be very angry with you.
Very angry indeed.
I guess it must be his age.
It's caught up with him.
I'm talking about my father.
Your father? What are you saying?
He's hiding a woman in his office.
Oh, you must be mistaken.
Your father is wonderful.
- He wouldn't do anything like that.
- This isn't the first time either.
She'll probably be there tomorrow too.
Carol, what shall I do?
I can't tell Mother.
- No, you mustrt do that.
- Tomorrow is their wedding anniversary.
Well, there must be some reason.
There has to be a reason.
How's his home life?
Father says it's noisy.
Usually when a man turns
to another woman...
...it's because something's lacking
in his home life.
He's seeking a change.
- Maybe he doesn't get enough affection.
- Of course he gets enough affection.
We think he's the most wonderful father
in the world.
At least he was.
Oh, Judy, we can't let this happen.
Not to your home.
I have an idea. Now, today
when you go home, be sure that you...
Judy, what are you doing?
Oh, just making things
more comfortable for him.
I mean, Father.
Well, that's very nice, I'm sure.
You really should do
something about your hair.
- My hair?
- Father would think it looks dreadful.
Please sit down.
As long as the dinner is good,
your father won't notice my hair.
It's terribly important to a man
how a womars hair looks.
It's important to your father
how his food tastes.
You spend too much time in the kitchen.
You should appeal more
to his aesthetic senses than to his stomach.
Oh, you don't know your father.
No, I guess I don't.
But then who does?
Mother, what shade of lipstick
are you using?
Let me see, I think the clerk
called it Soft Rose Number 3.
- Soft Rose?
- Or was it Number 4?
What you should use is Flaming Folly.
It does things for you.
Yes, I'm sure I would, Judy.
I'll bite my lips for tonight.
- Mother?
- Mm?
- Do you have a black nightgown?
- Judy Foster.
What is this all about?
Oh, nothing,
I've just been reading a book.
A book on how to have
a happy peaceful home.
Randolph? Do you have to be so noisy?
What did you do to your hair, Mom?
It looks awful.
You keep out of this.
Mother's hair looks simply beautiful.
- And it does things for her.
- Yes, I can feel it does.
- Randolph!
- Now what?
Stay out of it. That's for Father.
And when Father gets home,
be glad to see him.
And act with a little charm for once.
Sure, sure,
I'll be just like Walter Pidgeon.
Or would you rather
have me be Clark Gable?
Walter Pidgeon would be fine.
Oh, and when Father cracks a joke,
laugh whether it's funny or not. Just laugh.
Oh, that's asking a good deal, Judy.
Swing low, sweet chariot
Coming for to carry me...
Nightingale,
could you sing something else?
Yeah, I can sing "John Browrs Body
Lies A-Moldering in the Dust."
No, but not to try to sing so loud.
What is the use of singing
if you don't sing loud?
Swing low, sweet chariot
Two minutes till 6. Dinner ready yet?
JUD Y: Gramps?
- Eh?
Gramps, tonight when you say grace
at dinner...
...would you mention something about
home is where the heart is?
Sure thing, Judy. Sure thing.
Nightingale, Nightingale.
There's Father's car.
Randolph, Mother, come on down here.
Randolph, laugh at Father's jokes.
And, Mother, don't you forget
to kiss Father hello.
Let's all sing.
Mid pleasures and palaces
Though we may roam
Be it ever so humble
There's no place like home
There's no place like home
Oh, there's no place like home
Well, greetings, everybody, greetings.
- Hello, Melvin.
- Hello, Dora.
Father.
- Well.
- Hello, pater.
Hey, what's going on around here, anyway?
Dora, you look awfully funny.
- You sure you're feeling well?
- Oh, Father.
It's just a new hair dress, Melvin.
Judy didn't care for the old one.
Oh, like I always say,
hair today and gone tomorrow.
Now, wait a minute. Somebody's
up to some mischief around here.
Oh, we're just in high spirits.
After all, tomorrow is the big day.
So it is. And do you know
what else is going to happen tomorrow?
What else is going to happen?
You'd like to know, wouldn't you, huh?
- You're going to increase my allowance?
- Randolph.
I'm going to surprise you all.
A surprise?
Melvin, how wonderful. I adore surprises.
Yes, sir. A surprise to end all surprises.
Another one?
Oh, no. They're very good, though,
Mr. Andrews. Very Good.
You've been doing this sort of thing,
I presume, for some time?
No, just for a couple of days, in fact.
I see.
Going to make this your lifework?
No.
Got something else to do, is that it?
- Yes.
- What?
Look, Jameson...
...as a private investigator,
you couldn't get a job on a soap opera.
Yes, sir. I suppose you're right.
- Who sent you?
- Oh, I'm not at liberty to tell, sir.
- It couldn't be Carol's father, could it?
- Yes, sir. I mean no, sir.
Yes, sir.
Why should Mr. Pringle care
how long I've been mixing malted milks?
JAMESON:
After all, Carol's his only daughter.
He has to be careful of the kind of people
she becomes involved with.
STEPHEN: Go on.
- Well, it's just a routine sort of thing.
He's naturally interested in,
shall we say, your background.
Yes, let's do.
You can understand
his feelings on the matter.
His daughter's welfare
would be his first concern.
It would, eh?
Take care of him, Pop. I'll be right back.
Mr. Pringle is busy and can't be disturbed.
Perhaps this afternoon he'll talk to you.
Would you please tell Mr. Pringle
I wish to speak to him.
- Do you have an appointment?
- Just tell him Stephen I. Andrews is here.
Mr. Stephen Andrews is here, sir.
LUCIEN:
Not now, I'm busy.
WOMAN: But he's already on his way in,
Mr. Pringle.
LUCIEN:
It's customary to knock before you enter.
I didn't know you were interested
in courtesies or I would have knocked.
Now, just a moment.
What is it you want?
I wanna save you
a little time and expense.
My name is Stephen I. Andrews.
I weigh 1 70 pounds
and my health is excellent.
I spent two years in college,
three years in the Navy.
I'm working my way through school
to become a doctor.
- That's fine.
- I believe in God. I believe in my country.
And I don't think the younger generatiors
going to the dogs.
I play a good game of tennis.
My swimming gets by.
- Well, that's...
- My parents were born in Missouri...
...and have lived there for 46 years.
Unless they've done something
in the past two weeks...
...to disgrace the name of Andrews,
you'll find them respectable people...
...who have an interest
in what their sons are doing.
And if you'll excuse my saying so, sir,
if you'd do the same thing...
...you wouldn't send your butler out
asking silly questions...
...because you'd know yourself
what was going on.
Now, any further questions, Mr. Pringle?
Yes, I have.
Just what is your interest in my daughter?
She's one of the most beautiful, spoiled
egotistical girls I've ever had to meet.
Now that I've met you,
I understand better why she is as she is.
- Anything else?
- That's enough.
Then good day, sir.
Mr. Pringle, what are you doing home?
What's surprising
about coming to dinner?
Why, nothing, sir. Nothing.
Did you say dinner?
Yes. Now, whatever's prepared,
make it for three.
Yes, sir, three.
And tell my family
I want to see them in the library.
Yes, sir.
And I've got something
to say to you too later.
Yes, sir.
You see...
...I realized I haven't been
a very good father and...
Good evening, Father.
Good evening, Carol. Good evening.
You look lovely tonight, Carol.
You really do.
And you've grown too.
You certainly have.
Wort you come in and sit down?
OGDEN:
Good evening, Father.
Oh, Ogden, my boy.
Come in, come in.
Sit down, sit down.
You know, I thought perhaps we might...
...have a little sort of family
get-together before dinner.
It won't take long.
Sort of get acquainted with one another.
You know, it's just wonderful
to be home with one's family.
Just wonderful.
Father, I thought you had
a board of directors' meeting tonight.
Well, to tell you the truth, I did,
but I decided they could meet without me.
You see, I think my family
should come first.
Ogden, I've been thinking.
How would you like to go
on a fishing trip up in the mountains?
Just the two of us.
We could cook our own meals.
Of course, they probably won't be
very good. I was never much of a cook.
But I might be a lot of fun.
Don't you think so, son?
Well, yes, sir.
If you say so, sir.
Ogden, you know that "sir"
sort of frightens me.
Do you think maybe you could say "Dad"?
Yes, sir. Dad.
Say, I have an idea. How do you feel
about seeing a show tonight?
We could make it a party. Ogden...
Oogie, you might call Judy.
Nice girl, Judy. She might like to go along.
Oh, no, I can't call her.
You see, we've separated.
Well, of course, if that's the way
you feel about her, it's all right with me.
How about you, Carol?
I've been thinking about that young man,
Stephen.
Seems like a fine young man.
Good qualities.
Of course, I realize you're a little young...
...but I would have no objections
if after a while you...
Why don't you phone him?
Maybe he'd like to go to the show
with us.
I'd rather not.
I'm sure Stephen has no interest in me
whatsoever.
Nor I in him.
Oh, well, of course if that's the way
you feel about him, Carol...
...it's perfectly all right with me.
Father, did something go wrong
at the office today?
No, no, everything's fine.
Dinner is served.
Thank you. Thank you, Jameson.
Will you excuse me?
I'll be right with you.
Of course, dear. Come on, son.
Oh, Judy...! Oh.
- Hello.
- Hello, Judy?
Something frightening's just happened.
Father came home to dinner.
Yes.
He isn't acting a bit normal.
And that isn't all.
He practically came right out
and said it was time I was getting married.
I think he wants to get rid of me.
Carol, I know just how you feel.
I think Father's trying
to get rid of me too.
At dinnertime, he kept telling me
what a wonderful young man Oogie is.
Yes, he did.
Parents are such great responsibilities.
OGDEN :
In my heart
There's only room for Judaline
I've seen orchids
Try to bloom like Judaline
Judaline
Golden hair and an angel face
Spring for me is in her embrace
What a glow
To know that she is mine
Ain't she divine?
Beautiful to look at
Are my Judy's eyes
Bright as stars
When only two are in the sky
When there's Judy, there's melody
While there's Judy, there's love for me
And the sun will shine
Judaline
Judaline
Hey, Judy. Judy, I gotta talk to you.
Whatever you have to say
can keep till morning.
No, it can't. I gotta see you right away.
For heavers sakes,
go on down and talk to him.
All right, Father.
Okay, thanks, fellas.
You can go home now.
And don't make any noise.
This is the silliest thing I ever heard of.
Oogie, it isn't that I didn't enjoy the song.
It was very nice.
But did you have to wake up
the whole neighborhood with it?
Gee, I'm sorry, Judy.
I had to see you, though, to say goodbye.
Goodbye? Well, where you going?
Going on a fishing trip with my father.
But what about the radio show?
You mean, I shouldn't leave?
I don't care if you leave or not.
If you wanna walk out on a business deal,
you go ahead.
I shouldn't expect loyalty from you,
anyway.
Judy Foster, I've been loyal and true to you
for years.
Ever since the first time I met you
and you ran over me with your tricycle.
And you've been running over me
ever since.
But things have changed.
I've grown up.
And when you grow up
and can quit acting like a child, call me.
I may be waiting for you and I may not.
And in the meantime, I have many
important things to take care of.
One of them is to go on a fishing trip
with my dad.
We're going alone, just the two of us.
And we don't need any women around to
tells us what we can and what we can't do.
I maybe back in time for the radio show
and I may not.
So good night, Judy, and goodbye.
Attaboy, Oogie,
that's the way to talk to them.
Always keep the upper hand.
I don't know which one
is more middle-aged.
You'll be the sensation tonight, Mr. Foster.
I'm so glad for you, so glad.
Well, I'm happy
I don't have to earn a living doing that.
It's much easier selling fish.
Well, you do it for a living,
it is like selling fish.
Hope that you're not late
for your rehearsal...
...and that Mr. Cugat
won't be angry with you.
Cugie, angry?
Oh, no, he never gets angry.
He's sweet and kind just like you,
Mr. Foster.
Always a gentleman.
He's gentle as a kitten.
- And we'll be married pretty soon.
- No.
- Yes.
- Isn't that wonderful.
Well, I hope your married life
is as happy as mine has been.
It will be. If it's not,
I hit Cugie right on the head.
Yes, Mr. Foster?
Miss Rosita and I are going to the hotel
for the wedding-anniversary dinner tonight.
- You can take the rest of the day off.
- Thank you, Mr. Foster. I'd love to.
- Good luck. And congratulations.
- Thank you ever so much.
I'm going home to tell Mother.
Oh, no, Judy, you mustrt do that.
Not on the day
of her wedding anniversary.
In fact, I'm not sure
you should ever tell her.
Maybe somehow there's been a mistake.
Maybe.
There's no mistake.
I think she has a right to know.
Then at least wait
until after the party tonight.
All right.
Carol, you won't hold of this against me.
Of course not, Judy.
Who knows?
I may be coming to you
with the same kind of problem.
So my Rosita, my dove, my little pigeon,
the light of my life, she's late again, eh?
You think you're so good you don't
have to come to rehearsal, no?
Cugie, he's just a little bit upset.
Just a little.
And don't go away.
He does not stay angry long.
I'll show you.
Now, you're not going to stay
angry long with your baby?
Well, I'll forgive you.
This last time I forgive you.
But you better don't forget
a single word of your song.
You see? His bite is worst than his bark.
Now I rehearse my song, then
you talk about your dinner tonight, huh?
There.
Nice.
Pancho, go down with eight
and come up with the downbeat.
I love the Latin music of Señor Cugat
He's got the kind of a zip
That only a few got
The music is romantic
The music is exciting
But I like a little better what you got
Not Cugat, but what you got
Not Cugat, but what you got
Ahh...
That's the kind of the music. I like it.
It talks to my skin.
I'm a jitterbug and I'm hot as a pipe
I want to tell you, brother
I'm the bobby-sock type
I'm a red tomato and I'm overly ripe
I'm cooking with gas
I got a mellow fellow
And he's right on the track
And I'm so tutti-fruitti
That I holler, "Hey, Mack"
Beats me up, Barry
And I'll beat you right back
I'm cooking with gas
Dig, dig, dig, deep right in the grove
Then send me boy with a boot and a boat
I got some fish in my food
I don't know what the heck
That I'm talking about
I'm an alligator and I'm sharp as a bug
I like to boogie-woogie
Like to chew up a rug
I'm very, very groove
And I'm a hot chili pep
I'm cooking with gas
Oh, Dig, dig, dig, deep right in the grove
Then send me boy with a boot and a boat
I've got some fish in my food
I don't know what the heck
That I'm talking about
- Do you like it?
- Yes, I like it
- Do you dig me?
- Yes, I dig you
- Is it murder?
- Sure, it's murder
- Will you swing it?
- Yes, I will
I'm the zootiest chick this side of Brazil
Yes, sir.
DORA:
Come in.
Oh, Judy, dear, come in.
Will you please excuse us?
I'd like to talk to Mother alone.
I'm practically downstairs right now,
Miss Judy.
My, oh, my.
Doesrt she look just like a bride to be?
Thank you, Nightingale.
- Mother?
- Hm?
Do you love Father very much?
Very much, Judy.
Very, very much.
When a woman loves a man terribly...
...and finds out that he doesn't love her
like she thought he did...
...what happens then, Mom?
Well, at my age it might
very well be a tragedy.
But at your age, honey,
it's just all part of growing up.
Learning about people,
learning about a lot of things.
Whatever problem you have,
we'll work out together.
Now, this is no time to be sad.
We're all going out to dinner
and have a grand time, aren't we?
- Of course we are, but this is much...
- Ready, Dora?
- Practically ready, Melvin.
- Good evening, Father.
Oh, such formality.
Good evening, Miss Foster.
Will we do?
I'm looking at the two
most beautiful women in the world.
- Thanks, Melvin.
- Thank you, Father.
Judy, I want to speak to your mother
just a few minutes alone.
I'll be waiting outside
if you need me, Mother.
All right, dear.
Dora, I'm a little bit worried about Judy.
She's been acting very strange
the past week.
I just bumped into her
a few minutes ago...
...and she looked at me
and shook her head.
I thought she want to tell me something,
then she ran away.
She's probably trying to make up
her mind between Stephen and Oogie.
And, Melvin...
...your letting her make her own decision
as you're doing is wonderful.
Judy will be all right.
I think she likes living here.
You know something, Dora?
I do too.
- There. You look really sharp, Gramps.
- You really think so, Randolph?
Sure. I bet you were a jim-dandy
when you were a young guy.
Well, I never had any complaints.
Randolph? Gramps?
I have something to say
of the utmost importance.
Something that may change
our whole lives.
- You gonna run for president?
- This is no time for jokes, Randolph.
- Oh, what is it, Judy girl?
- Well, just remember one thing if you will.
Whatever happens this evening,
we must be patient and understanding.
We must stick together.
Please remember.
My sister used to be
a normal human being.
Now she's in love.
Never criticize anyone for being in love,
Randolph.
It's a mighty important institution.
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
I take great pleasure in presenting to you...
...our very talented,
lovely and beautiful singer...
...Señorita Rosita Conchellas.
We gotta get going
Where are we going?
What are we gonna do?
We're on our way to somewhere
But only me and you
All we see there, who we'll see there
What a very big surprise
There may be caballeros
With dark and flashing eyes
We're on our way
Pick up your pack
And if we stay
We won't come back
How can we go?
We haven't got a dime
But we're going
And you're gonna have happy time
Now, someone said
They just come back from somewhere
A friend of mine that I don't even know
He said there's lot of fun
If we can get there
If that's the case
That's the place
The place we want to go
We gotta get going, where we going?
The nerve of her. How dare she?
How dare she?
And in front of Mother too.
Who we'll see there, who will be there
What a very big surprise
There maybe caballeros
With dark and flashing eyes
I'll take the train
You take the boat
Or I'll take the plane
And you ride the boat
Oh, we don't care
We rather walk or climb
But we're going
And you're gonna have a happy time
Melvin, she seems to know you.
Oh, yes, I get around quite a bit.
- We've got a great big secret, Dora.
- Did somebody say, "Let's eat"?
Nobody did, Gramps,
but it's a good idea.
Hello, girls, did you want to see me?
Never mind being polite.
- You ought to be ashamed.
- Ashamed of what?
Running around with a man
old enough to be your father.
It is my business
who I choose to run around with.
- You run around with a married man.
- A married man with children.
- Just a minute, did you say married?
- Yes, married and with two children.
- Grown children.
- Two children?
You're breaking up a wonderful family
and a happy home.
It was a happy home.
You wait in here.
Don't go away.
There, sit down.
Now you tell him
what you just told me.
Go on, tell him.
Go on. Okay, then I tell him.
You big good-for-nothing unfaithful lug.
Why don't tell me you're married?
And have two children. Grown children.
What do you mean, married?
I am not married.
I don't have two children of any kind.
What is this all about?
We didn't mean you, Mr. Cugat.
We were talking about Mr. Foster.
Mr. Foster? Mr. Foster, eh?
- My father.
- Her father.
Werert you at his office this week?
And hiding in his closet?
- Well, were you?
- Of course I was.
I mean, I was teaching him to rumba.
In a closet?
Oh, I see.
You thought... Oh, my.
I was teaching your father to rumba as
a surprise for you and your mother tonight.
What?
Oh, I'm afraid we made
a terrible mistake, Miss Rosita.
Oh, please forgive us, Mr. Cugat.
I forgive you.
You I wanna talk to.
And as for Mr. Foster,
he better know how to do the rumba.
I guess I better apologize to my father.
I think the less said the better.
Might as well go back now.
Just a minute, Carol. I believe
we have some unfinished business.
Now that my faith in men
has been restored...
...what's this about you and Stephen?
Stephen? Well, I don't know.
That is, not exactly.
Well, exactly what
does "not exactly" mean?
I mean that Stephen
isn't interested in me.
Not even a little bit.
Well, then, if he isn't interested in you,
Carol, maybe he could be interested in me.
I think he might be.
- Shall we join the others?
- Mm-hm.
I should have known all the time
my father was fatherly.
Dora, I don't like to mention this...
...but don't you think you should brush up
on your rumba a little bit?
Tell me, how did you manage to keep this
a secret from the children and me?
No trouble at all. It was easy.
In fact, they used to call me
"Foxy Foster."
Excuse me, Carol.
Evening, Oogie.
- Oh, good evening.
- Hi.
There's something
I wish to discuss with you.
Oh, of course. Go right ahead.
I thought you'd like to know
that I've changed.
I'm not the same Judy Foster
you knew yesterday.
Well, you look the same to me.
I've decided to take you back.
Frankly, Miss Foster,
I don't want you back.
Oogie Pringle, you listen to me.
First you want me, then you don't want me.
Now that I want you to want me,
you don't want me. Make up your mind.
- I have made up my mind.
- He has made up his mind.
- Mitzi, you keep out of it.
- I don't have to.
- You keep out...
- Girls, girls, please be calm.
You'll find someone someday, Judy.
Good evening, Mr. Pringle.
Oh, Oogie. Oogie, you're so right.
I hope you two will be very happy.
Oh, Oogie,
I didn't know you cared for me.
Oh, don't talk to me.
I'm confused.
Good evening, Stephen, Mr. Pringle.
- Judy, Is my daughter here?
- She's right over there.
- Will you excuse me?
- Oh, I certainly will.
Will you dance with me, Stephen?
The situatiors desperate.
Of course I'll dance with you, Judy.
May I join you?
Please do.
What would you say if I told you
I had the prettiest...
...and nicest daughter
in the whole world?
I guess I'd be so happy...
...I don't know what to say.
Then don't say anything.
- Would you like to dance?
- No, thank you.
In fact, I think I'd like to go home.
I wish you'd do me a favor.
I'd like you to stay, just a little while.
Just as you say, Dad.
Where are you going?
I have something very important
to take care of.
Ladies and gentlemen...
...we have a young lady here
with us tonight...
As a matter of fact,
she's just a little more than 1 6.
- who will sing a song
in honor of her mother and father...
...who are celebrating
their 20th wedding anniversary.
Miss Judy Foster.
This is the final insult.
Don't forget, Judy, this is a celebration
for your mother and dad.
May I?
Havert you forgotten something?
Maybe.
I'm spoiled and egotistical.
That's right.
Maybe I'll get used to you, say in...
Well, say in a few years. You think so?
If you don't, it will be all your fault.
That's all right. I'll take that chance.
I forgive you for everything.
It's a most unusual day
It's like catching a bridal bouquet
It's like reaching the moon
Or composing a tune
It's a most unusual day
All the world is bursting with song
And I feel like I really belong
It's like finding a friend
Having money to spend
It's a most unusual day
There are people greeting people
There is sunshine everywhere
There are people greeting people
And a feeling of spring in the air
It's a most unusual time
I keep feeling my temperature climb
If my heart won't behave
In the usual way
Then there's only one thing to say
It's the most unusual
Most unusual
Most unusual day
