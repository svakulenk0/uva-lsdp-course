- Good evening.
- Good evening.
- My-My- My name is Latsie Dolly.
I just come from-
from Budapest with my nieces.
And-This is Jenny,
and this is Rosie.
I- I look- look my- look for
my old friend, Mr. Tsimmis.
Is- Is he here? No?
I'm new here.
Waiter!
This man is looking for somebody
by the name of Crimmis.
No. No, Crimmis-Tsimmis,
with the "Zis."
Tsimmis, the theater
booking agent?
There is just
one Tsimmis in the world.
Tsimmis! There's
somebody here to see you!
Oh!
Ignatz, my old friend.
Oh!
Since eight long years,
I don't see you.
That's right.
And since eight long years,
you owe me a thousand hellers...
from that last game of clobyosh
we played in Budapest.
Here in America,
that's, uh, $11.
N-Not for the children.
We will play now.
Maybe I win it back.
Latsie, take that off.
- Come here, come here.
-
-
-
-
-
Waiter. Waiter.
- Come. Give us, please, a deck of cards.
- Here.
No, no.
New ones, please.
-
-
My- My nieces.
What-Wh-Wh-Wh-What are you doing?
Don't make me nervous. Go to the band
and watch the music, darlings.
Children, come here.
-
-
- Ooh! Yoy! Yoy!
-
-
-
- You deal-
- Ah! What!
Hey.
I am glad we didn't
play dominoes.
Nothing you should play,
you understand?
Mr. Tsimmis was just asking about you.
- Same old trouble, Uncle?
- There is no trouble.
Only I have $42 in I.O.U.'s, all from
your uncle, and I don't get paid.
Look, eight dollars he loses to me
in Zimmerman's back room.
Back room? It wasn't in the back room.
It was in the center of the restaurant.
All right, all right.
Six dollars from Lichau's out by the kitchen.
Kitchen? I never played cards in the kitchen.
That-That was in the back room.
Yes, yes, yes.
Here, $22 when we played in my office.
- In- In your office?
- Yes, in my office.
- All right, all right.
- Not a cent do I get. What is this?
Uncle, aren't you ashamed?
After you promised me.
I give you my word.
Never again I will touch a card.
So help me.
Look, Mr. Ignatz, you'll never
get your money as long as we work here.
So if you find us a real job, why, we could
pay you a little every week for Uncle's losses.
- Wouldn't we, Rosie?
- Of course. You could take it out of our salary.
- Would you go out of town?
- Oh, we'd go anywhere.
All right, girls, uh, here's a date I promised
Miller's Midgets, but I give it to you.
But this is the last time we play clobyosh,
you understand?
- Oh, it's a deal. Where do we go?
- Elmira.
Elmira?
Is it on the map?
You got to catch the 7:30
from Hoboken in the morning.
We're on it. Come on, Jenny. We just have time
to rent costumes before they close.
- Coming, Uncle?
- Li-Little later, darling. Little later.
- Uncle, so help you?
-
Sweetheart.
So help me.
So help me.
Will you have the cards
again in your face?
Later. But first,
we will play one more game.
Tickets.
Tickets, please.
Tickets.
Half fare.
- How old are you?
- I'm 10, and my sister's 11.
Uh, we always travel
half fare.
-
- Hmm.
Tickets, please.
See, I told you we could get by with it.
- That's $3.00 saved.
-
- Oh, uh, just a minute.
- I beg your pardon?
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to-
That's all right, little girl.
No charge for looking.
Uh, are you an actor?
Well, the jury's still out,
but, uh, I think so.
Well, what do you do?
I just finished two weeks
at the New York Victoria.
Hammerstein's Victoria?
There's only one.
Well, then-Then you
must be a headliner.
Mm, yes, when I'm not starring
in musical comedy.
Oh.
Uh, you must know
everybody in New York.
Everyone from Lillian Russell
to Georgie Cohan.
We don't know a soul.
We sing and dance. And when we grow up,
we'd just love to be on the stage...
if we could meet
the right people.
All little girls want to go on the stage.
Oh. I- I wonder, please,
could you introduce us to Mr. Hammerstein?
Oscar? When you're
in New York, look me up.
He has dinner every week
with me at the Friars Club.
The Friars Club?
Oh, how wonderful.
- You're very kind, Mr. - Mr. -
- Fox. Harry Fox.
Well, uh, wouldn't you like
to turn your chair around, Mr. Fox?
We'll all be more comfortable.
-
- I suppose so.
How far are you going,
Mr. Fox?
- Elmira.
- Elmira?
You're playing there
after Broadway?
Oh. I always like to break in
my new material out of town.
- Oh, we're going to Elmira too.
- To visit some relatives.
Well, then you can catch
my act while you're there.
I should say we will.
- Mr. Fox?
- Oh, thanks.
-
- Manager!
- I want to see the manager.
- Maybe he don't want to see you.
Ever think of it that way?
Have you met Elmer?
- Where's the manager?
- Stop shouting! There's a rehearsal on!
-
- That wasn't him. That was me!
- What's eatin' you anyway?
- I'm Harry Fox.
What's the idea of billing an unknown
sister act over me? And a trained seal!
- Now-
- Who are the Dolly Sisters
anyway? I never heard of them!
What's the difference?
Nobody ever heard of you either!
Besides, there's two of them, and there's
only one seal. And there's only one of you!
Now you listen-
-
-
- Oh, hello, Mr. Fox.
- Hello.
-  Surprise.
- You, uh, might have told a fella.
Mr. Fox objects
to his billing here.
What's wrong
with the billing?
- I dressed with a trained seal
once. We didn't get along.
- Oh, is that so?
Have you got a college degree?
A. B? B. A? Ph. D?
- What's your alphabet?
- Well, I was lucky to get through high school.
Well, then, don't look
down on an educated seal.
- Let me tell you some-
- Well, he can't help it.
You see, Mr. Fox
is a Broadway headliner.
- Direct from two weeks at Hammerstein's Victoria.
- Rosie, please.
Well, is there any law against
a fella giving himself a little buildup?
- Never heard of one.
-
We haven't got all day! We got an Elks dance
and a wedding to play! Let's go!
Hi, fellas. Look, bring me on
with a fast eight bars of "I Love the Lady."
And there's a new tune there I wrote myself
called "I Can't Begin To Tell You."
- It's a ballad, but I want it played lively, see?
- Everybody does.
-
-
- That's not it at all.
-
Keep it light and gay.
Pick it up in the treble,
like this, in a shoddish tempo.
- Wonderful.
- Thanks.
You ought to be the leader at Hammerstein's
Victoria. I didn't get your name.
- Gilbert Oystermore.
- Oh. Well, I'll make a note of that.
Thanks, boys.
I'll see you tonight.
They went that way.
Hey, they're not bad little babes.
- How about you and me datin' them up tonight?
- You look better with the seal.
Oh, thanks very much.
Oh, yeah?
If Elmer looked anything like you,
I'd make a fur coat out of him.
Stop it. He hates you.
Come on. Come on, hurry up.
- Oh.
- It's a good thing we don't own a trunk.
- It's a good thing we're not a trio.
- That's right.
-
-
I'll get it.
Well?
Oh, for us?
- You're the Dolly Sisters, ain't ya?
- Well, yes, but-
- That's what it says here.
- Thank you very much.
I knew it. That nice-looking gentleman with
the bald head in the third row. Remember him?
How could I forget?
He's been in that same seat for five shows.
"My mistake. You two girls
can be billed over me anytime.
How about a cup of coffee?
Harry Fox."
Oh, how sweet.
Let's go have a bite
to eat with him.
There you go again,
Josephine.
- Well, we've got to eat anyway.
And stop calling me Josephine.
-
-
- This is our introduction.
We're in the wings.
This is the proscenium arch.
And do just like I told you.
Don't get nervous, honey.
Well, shouldn't we be
singing as we come on?
Everybody else does that,
so we'll be different. We'll sing later.
It's a funny feeling
working with a man.
-
-
Darling, we're sensational. We're killing 'em.
Let's take another bow.
Okay.
-
-
- You picked that up in a hurry.
- Rosie will get it in a minute. She's awfully quick.
But, Jenny, I-Well, I've been looking for
a girl in my act, and I thought-
Oh. You mean
just you and me?
Oh, Rosie and I
could never separate.
Why-Why we've been an act
ever since we were kids.
But I mean,
a really classy act.
Evening clothes,
Fifth Avenue dresses.
Why, pretty soon,
we'd really be on the bill at Hammerstein's.
Oh, I'm sorry, Harry.
And I'm flattered that you want me...
but, well, you ought to know
what a sister act means.
W-We're tied together somehow,
and nothing else counts.
No matter how
attractive it seems.
- Well, anyway, thanks for the attractive.
-
Elmer wants to sleep.
Whew! All that rush
for nothing.
You might have at least waited
long enough to say good-bye.
- Just common courtesy.
- Oh, he's common enough as it is.
Here, you watch the bags
while I go get the tickets.
-
- Psst! Hey, Jenny.
Jenny. Psst.
Hey, come here.
Oh, Harry.
I didn't mean to rush off
without saying good-bye.
Yeah, sure. Say, Jenny,
there's something I got to tell you.
I'm gonna miss you.
Oh. Why, you hardly
know me though.
Yeah, sure, I know,
but I know how I feel.
I'm gonna miss you too,
I guess.
Don't you know?
-
-
Gee, I never thought falling in love
would be like this.
It's so- so sudden and-
and all mixed up with trains and things.
So, Jenny, look,
if I don't get to New York right away...
- give me a break and wait for me, will ya?
- Oh, of course I will, Harry.
That's all I wanted to know.
- Good-bye.
-
Somebody could have stolen our bags.
Now what have you been up to?
Oh. Oh, uh,
my handkerchief blew away.
There isn't a breeze.
For a lost handkerchief,
you certainly have a peculiar gleam in your eye.
Stanton, Alford, Dover
and Hoboken. All aboard!
Oscar Hammerstein's office.
No, Mr. Caruso,
he's not in.
That could never happen to me
in Saint Petersburg. I'll never wait.
I'm so sorry.
Practice your singing every minute
and practice your dancing.
Well, uh,
aren't you Flo Daly?
- Gee! I read where Ziegfeld's gonna star you.
- Oh.
We really appreciate every bit
of advice you've given us, Miss Daly.
Well, don't appreciate it. Use it.
Live with and for your work.
That's the only way
you'll get ahead.
That's what I do
every minute I'm awake.
Oh, tell him hold on.
I'll be there in a minute.
And remember, girls, concentrate on your work.
Nothing else matters.
Oh.
- Mademoiselle Polaire.
- Oh, he's expecting you. Will you come in, please?
Oh!
- The famous Polaire.
- Yeah.
Oh, excuse-
Jenny!
Hello, Harry.
Oh, gee, I'm glad to see you.
- Hello, Rosie. How are you?
- I was fine.
Say, I- I wrote you, but you must have moved,
'cause all the letters came back.
Oh, that's a shame.
I'm so sorry.
- Well, this is great luck.
Could I buy you a cup of coffee?
- Uh-huh.
To think, the best offer I've had all day
has to come from you.
Why, you girls have got twice as much talent-
and you're a hundred times
better looking.
You just haven't made
people recognize it.
What you need is style,
importance.
-
- Glamour.
Well, um, how do
we get this glamour...
out of a hat
like a magician with a rabbit?
In a way. But if
you girls do as I say...
you'll have Hammerstein
on his hands and knees begging for you.
- I can hardly wait.
- Rosie.
It'll take nerve- plenty of it-
and a heart full of courage.
But if you follow my advice,
you'll never have to play the small-time again.
- What time is it, Uncle?
- 4:30.
He said they would
be here at 2:30.
Well, Mr. Hammerstein's
always a little late.
Oh, he's two days late this time,
and on our money. Borrowed money.
They'll be here.
Harry said so.
Oh, of all the idiotic things
I ever let you talk me into.
And-And the wardrobe
you've charged.
Such fine references
I gave for you.
- What references?
- What references? The Hungarian ambassador.
-
- Oh.
Give it to me.
Give it to me. Hello?
Hello? Hello?
The suite of
the Dolly Sisters.
What? Yes.
Yes, send them right up.
Quick! Quick!
They're coming! They're coming!
- Now, Miss Smarty, who's an idiot?
- I don't believe it.
Girls, don't forget the Hungarian accents
you were born with.
- I wish I could show you what I mean.
-
I'm sorry we're late, ladies,
but Mr. Hammerstein was detained at his banker's.
Mr. Hammerstein,
I want you to meet Miss Jansci Dolly.
How do you do?
-
- What is his name, please?
Hammerstein.
Oscar Hammerstein.
I do not hear of him before.
Is he important manager?
Well, he's only the biggest
and most important manager in America.
-  Oh.
- Then we will consider him.
- No, Rozsicka?
- Mm. Yes, Jansci.
Won't you come in, please?
Play, please.
We have been to gay Paris
Gay Paris
Where your heart, she dances
like the bubbles in the wine
Where life is so divine
Where love
she's yours and mine
When we was in Vienna
Vienna
Was so wonderful
We drink, we waltz
we eat, we waltz, we drink
We waltz again
What else can you do
In Vienna
To Budapest
we make a trip
To dance to gyp... sy
music
But when you do
the czardas
Just be careful
what you're saying
A lady can't be too discreet
When violins
Is "playingk"
Yes, we have been around
We've lived
we have learned
And we'd like to
make it clear
That as far as we're
Concerned
Mr. Hammerstein, you dare to
shake your head at the Dolly Sisters?
From Budapest?
Never before have I seen
two such lovely girls.
- You mean you like us?
- You'll take us?
My dears, I don't care where
you come from- Budapest or Brooklyn.
You open at the Victoria
in two weeks.
- Oh, Jenny!
- Oh, Rosie!
Harry!
If you're a lonely little lady
And life hasn't been so nice to you
Listen, lonely little lady
This is our advice
To you
Don't be too old-fashioned
Old-fashioned girl
Give yourself that 1915 flair
When you're walking up
Fifth Avenue
And wintery winds are blowing
Don't get too upset
If your petticoat is showing
Be like Irene Castle
And bob your hair
Throw away your flannel underwear
Light a cigarette
Be a suffragette
Be part of the merry world
And order an old-fashioned
Old-fashioned girl
And if you're not as pretty
As the dollies in the Follies
Don't let it worry you a bit
You won't be too old-fashioned
If you wake up
To the magic of a makeup kit
I'm Lady Lipstick
I do well by mademoiselle
But bear this thought in mind
A kiss isn't tellable
If you use the indelible kind
I'm Patricia Powder
I dispose of the shine on your nose
Who would try to deny my repute
I'm adored by belles
But not by their beaus
'Cause, ooh, what I do
To a blue serge suit
Patricia, you're a wonder
and you know your stuff
But I'm the one that's pushed around
and treated rough
I hate to cause dissension
but why don't you ever mention
Your little poor relation
Patsy Powder Puff
I am Rosie Rouge
You won't be called a hussy
Just because you're properly painted
And remember a girl that's quaint
Never gets acquainted
Mascara
I'm Mascara
I can do for you
What I did for Theda Bara
For in my subtle way I emphasize
That gleamy, dreamy
"come and see me" mischief
In your eyes
You must agree that
we've proven conclusively
That powder and lipstick and rouge
Improvises youth
And disguises truth
Powder and lipstick and rouge
Radiates the cold
Rejuvenates the old
What if some freckles may vex you
Just spend some shekels
and freckles will
Never perplex you
Beautiful faces
come out of vanity cases
With powder and lipstick and rouge
What if some freckles may vex you
Just spend some shekels
And freckles will never perplex you
Beautiful faces
come out of vanity cases
Join the merry world
Old-fashioned
Girl
Mademoiselle,
permit me to tell you...
how much I am enchanted that
you're coming to Paris under my management.
- Thank you.
- Here are the contracts and the tickets.
You have the best suite
on the
Oh, thank you, Monsieur Philippe.
We're almost all packed.
Good night, Monsieur Philippe,
and thank you for liking us so much.
Mademoiselle.
- Au revoir.
- Thank you.
And now, monsieur, how would you like
a little snack with me?
- What?
- A little snack.
Snack? I- I don't know,
but if you show me just once, I can play it.
- I mean something to eat.
- To eat? I am not a bit hungry.
But maybe a little steak with some
potatoes and- and a bite of pudding, please.
A suite on the
That isn't the way we came over.
I'll say it isn't.
Is Harry still
on the road?
I don't know.
I just can't understand him.
He used to write me every day
no matter where he was playing.
I guess he's met someone else
and hasn't the nerve to tell me.
Could be. Well, I'm gonna go
tell Flo about Paris.
Oh, don't forget we have a date with her tonight
at Ronnie Warburton's.
- Jenny.
- Harry!
Oh!
- It's really you.
- Uh-huh.
- Oh!
- Darling, darling.
Here, let me look at you.
Yep. You're exactly like
I dream about you.
- Do you know you always smile
with your eyes first?
- Do I?
- Yes.
- Oh, darling.
Oh.
Oh, Harry, why didn't you
let me know you were coming?
Well, I couldn't.
I just happened to be in town, and I got
a sudden impulse to drop by and say hello.
You know me-
Always obey that impulse.
Oh.
Well, Rosie and I have obeyed one too.
We're sailing day after tomorrow.
We've signed with Philippe
for a show in Paris.
Paris? Well, gee,
that-that's great.
You're really glad.
Well-Well, of course.
It's- It's what you want,
isn't it?
Of course.
That's what you want too,
isn't it?
Or maybe Paris isn't far enough.
Maybe you'd like it if I went to China.
- Oh, Harry, be honest with me.
What's happened to us?
- Nothing.
- Is- Is there someone else?
- You know it isn't that.
Well, then it must be something.
It- It can't just be the separation.
Then what?
Oh, Harry, it isn't because
I landed on top first, is it?
Oh, you fool.
You darling fool.
How can that
make any difference?
But it does, Jenny.
And it's not just a matter of pride.
But you love me, don't you?
And I love you.
That's all that counts.
Everything else is nonsense.
No, it isn't nonsense,
Jenny.
I've seen other people try it,
dozens of them.
Oh, it's not just
the money or the fame.
It's a lot of other little things
all added up. It just won't work.
Oh, it's all right as long as the stardust
is still there...
but then the stardust blows away
and a kind of poison sets in.
In- In other words, you-
you don't want to marry me.
- More than anything else in the world.
- Oh.
But I can't.
Not till I get someplace.
Not even if I ditch
the Paris engagement?
I can't let you
do that, Jenny.
Oh, I see.
Well, there's no use
dragging things out, is there?
I mean, we-we might as well
make a clean break and say good-bye.
Yeah, I guess so.
- Good-bye then.
- Good-bye, Jenny.
Uh, no more letters.
Not that you've been writing much lately.
No. No more letters.
But- But we'll
always be friends?
Sure, sure.
Good-bye, Jenny.
Good-bye.
Good-bye.
Buy you a cup of coffee?
It's no use, Harry.
Just go, will you?
That Daly woman. She had to dope out
tomorrow's horses at New Orleans.
- Come on. We're late.
- All right.
- I can't. I'm going home.
- But you promised.
That's what I said.
Taxi!
Taxi!
Oh, thank you. Oh!
- Oh, I was looking for a taxi.
- So I see.
I'll get you one, but it'll take time.
You better take me up on that coffee first.
- No, thanks very much, but I-
- Now see here. You're drenched.
Do you want to get
to Paris with pneumonia?
- Well, I guess not.
- All right, then. Come on.
Here you are, Miss Dolly.
That will warm you up.
- Thank you, Mr. Dowling.
-
Never forget the first time
I saw those knees.
On the way to Elmira,
remember?
Sure.
- You and your half fare.
-
- There.
- Thank you.
I think the patient has
an even chance to recover.
Oh, thank you, Doctor.
You have a lovely manner.
Thank you.
- How about a bite to eat?
- No, thank you. I don't care for anything.
Uh, what are you doing
about your songs?
Oh, nothing much.
Except "Rainbows." Remember it?
Oh, yes. I liked it.
Well, it goes like this now.
Well, I knew I was coming to a party,
so I brought my music along.
- Here you are, Mr. Harris.
Help yourself, Mr. Tannen.
- Thank you. After you, Sam.
- Hello, Jenny.
- Oh, hello.
- Did you write that song?
- Sure.
- I like it a lot.
- Oh, really, Sam?
Oh. Oh, uh, this is Mr. Harris
of Cohan and Harris.
- This is Harry Fox.
- How do you do?
- Hello.
- Why don't you stop at my office sometime?
- I'd like to talk business to you.
- I'd be glad to.
- When could you come?
- How about right now?
- No. Tomorrow will do. Good night, Jenny.
- Good night, Sam.
- Good night, young fella.
- Good night.
- Good night, Dowling. Good night, Jules.
- Good night, Sam.
- If he puts it in a show,
it means half a million copies.
- Yeah.
You see, a twist of the wrist
and you're a hit too.
Oh, Harry, do I have to go to Paris?
I don't want to.
But, Jenny, the Folies Bergère,
think of the chance.
I still don't want to.
Darling, nobody can turn down
an offer like that.
Nobody, darling?
- Hello.
- We played on the bill with you
and Rosie in Atlanta once.
You wouldn't remember our act.
We were on too early.
Anyway, when war was declared, my partner
enlisted right away. Me, I couldn't make it myself.
I'm putting on shows here
to sell Liberty bonds.
There's one tonight at the hotel.
I'd like to have you and your sister go on for us.
People love you, and you'll
sell bonds like wildfire.
Try and bring Mr. Fox along, but I know
he's singin' at recruiting rallies all the time.
Sure made a big hit at the Palace.
Had it comin' to him. Swell fella.
Thanks for comin' tonight.
I'll announce you myself.
- That's about all I can do to help.
- Why-
My partner enlisted right away.
I couldn't make it.
Nice hearing your voice again,
Mrs. Fox. See ya tonight. Ahem.
- Thanks a million.
- We'll be there, and thanks,
Mr. Keno, for dropping in.
It's all right.
Whew!
- Kathi, do you think it's ready yet?
- Just about.
Oh! Here, let me
take it out myself.
- Ooh!
- Better you should use these, Miss Jenny.
- Ah.
-
Mm-hmm. Well, Kathi
helped me a little bit.
Where's Harry? I thought you were
picking him up at the Friars.
