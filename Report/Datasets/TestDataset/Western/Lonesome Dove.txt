Go down to the river
to eat that snake.
Go on, get.
Go on.
Get out of here.
Little early
to be quitting,
ain't it, girls?
Or is it Christmas?
Girls yourself.
It ain't
Christmas, neither.
It's that hell bitch.
She bit a hunk
out of him.
I'm glad you got here
before fall, Newt.
We've been
missing you.
It's supper time.
Either that
or old Bolivar's
calling up bandits.
We hear you,
dern it, we hear you!
'I God, Woodrow,
as long as you've
worked around horses,
I'd think
you wouldn't
turn your back
on Kiowa mares.
You want to think
something,
think that roof
back up on the barn
instead of sitting
in the shade.
I ain't scared
to be lazy.
That don't
recommend you much.
Can we eat,
or are we waiting till
the argument's over?
You will starve
if you wait for that.
Many thanks.
If you ever get
tired of loafing,
you can get work
waiting tables.
I had a job
waiting tables once,
on a riverboat.
Wasn't older
than Newt there, but...
I had to give it up.
How come?
Well, I was too
young and pretty.
The whores wouldn't
let me alone.
Listening to you brag
don't improve the taste
of these Mexican
strawberries none.
The only way
you'll get better food
is by shooting Bolivar.
And another thing, Bol.
Quit whacking that
dinner bell for supper.
Whack it at noon
if you want to.
A man with any sense
can tell it's sundown
without you
whacking that bell.
General Robert E. Lee
freed the slaves.
I can whack
if I want to.
Abe Lincoln
freed the slaves,
not General Lee.
He didn't
free Mexicans
anyway, Bol.
It was, uh...
Americans that
he freed.
You're in over
your head, Pea.
It was Africans
Abe Lincoln freed,
no more American
than Call, here.
I'm American, by God.
You was born in Scotland,
though you was on the teat
when they brought you.
I'm as American
as anybody
from Tennessee.
You boys can sleep
easy tonight
knowing Captain
Woodrow F. Call
is guarding the river,
keeping you safe
from Indians
and Mexican bandits.
There ain't no
Indians no more.
We cleaned them out.
How about Blue Duck?
You never got him.
No, we never got
that half-breed.
Blue Duck ain't
around here nowhere.
His range
is further north.
How come the Captain
goes to the river?
He just misses
the wild old days
when he had somebody
to outwit, that's all.
I'll whack that bell
if I want to.
What's the matter
with that knife, Bol?
Won't hold an edge?
It is like a wife.
Every night
you better stroke it.
Your wife
in Mexico
must be getting
rusty by now.
She don't get
sharpened
more than
twice a year,
does she, Bol?
She is old.
Like you.
The older the violin,
the sweeter the music.
You ought to bring
her to meet me.
No, I know you.
You would try
to corrupt her.
How about one
of your daughters?
You've got nine,
ain't you?
I don't see
no scalps.
Good night to slip
into Mexico and
cross some stock.
Cross it and do what?
It ain't against
the law for you to work.
Can I go to Mexico?
I'm getting
old enough now.
You'll get old
quick if you sit
around talking.
Best go on
to bed.
It's still early,
Captain.
You go to bed now.
We got work tomorrow.
Yes, sir.
You ought to let him
set awhile.
The only
education he's got
is listening to me.
What kind of education
is that?
You think
he'll learn more
shoveling horse
poop for you?
I shovel my share.
It ain't hurt me.
Fine, if that's
how you want to
make your fortune.
I think I'll straggle
down to that gin palace
see if I can't
scare me up a card game.
Now, you pigs...
You don't wait
up for me, now.
Evening, my good friend.
Mr. Gus,
come in, come in.
Loan me $2.00,
all right, Gus?
Why would I loan
money to a loafer?
You ought to be
trailing cattle.
I'm leaving next week
to do just that.
I'll pay you back.
Evening, Lorie.
You look fine.
Real fine.
Listen, me and Lorie
are trying to talk.
Dish, you got
a sour stomach?
What you need is
a good game of cards.
Ain't that right,
Lippy?
I didn't come in
to play no cards.
How about you, Wanz?
Put that rag away.
Most people wouldn't notice
dead skunks on the table.
Put you in
a better mood.
Nothing else to do
around here anyway.
Almost sunup.
How did anybody
that pretty wind up in
Lonesome Dove?
A gambler named
Tinkersley
left her here
a couple of years ago.
Before that,
he'd had her, uh...
sparking boys
in San Antone to
pay his debts.
Damn him.
She didn't mind.
She was rat-holing
her tips,
trying to save
to get to
San Francisco.
He stole her money.
She caught him
drunk and tried
to shoot him.
He beat her
black and blue.
Bit her lip, too.
That's how come
she got that scar.
That little scar.
I kind of like her.
You been with her?
Sure, who ain't?
Even Wanz treats himself
once or twice a week.
Of course,
she won't have nothing
to do with Lippy.
Here's that $2.00 you
wanted to borrow, Dish.
Go ahead, take it.
Wouldn't want it said
I'd refuse a loan
to a friend.
Much obliged, then.
I'll pay you back
this fall.
No need to ride
off tonight, Dish.
Throw your blanket
on our front porch.
I appreciate that.
I do, I...
Darn, I think I left
something on the table.
Imagine that.
If it's all right
with you, Dish,
I won't wait.
No need.
You go on.
Get from here,
you pigs.
I ain't giving you
no biscuits.
Now go on, get.
Go on.
What's Dish Boggett
doing on
the front porch?
Well, sleeping,
unless you woke him.
How's that horse bite?
Hell, I been
bit worse by bedbugs
in Saltillo.
Let me pour
some axle grease on it.
Tend to your biscuits.
You up all night
reading the good book?
It's hard to have fun
in a place like this, but
I do my best.
Oh.
Biscuits are ready.
We come here
to make money.
There wasn't nothing
about fun in the deal.
You like money
even less than
you like fun,
if that's possible.
Wake up, Newt.
You'll poke your eye
with your own fork.
See what happens
when you keep him
up all night talking.
Hurry, Pea.
It'll take a hacksaw
to cut them eggs,
the way
frying them in
coffee grounds, Bol.
I don't care.
Pea eye, it's bad manners
to go relieving yourself
where people
are eating breakfast.
What would
your mama think?
Good morning.
Morning, Dish.
Have some bacon.
Thanks, Captain.
You can work it off.
Work it off?
Hey, come look who's
riding up the road.
It ought
to be Deets.
He's due back
from San Antone.
It's Deets,
but not alone.
That's Deets
all right.
Who's the other one?
'I god, Woodrow,
that's Jake Spoon!
Danged if you
ain't right.
Lord, how long
has it been?
10 years.
Well, howdy, boys.
What's for breakfast?
You're too late.
We ate.
You always
was a hog, Gus.
Captain.
Good to see you.
Where you been
all these years?
Arkansas most recently.
Your horse
looks like you
left in a hurry.
Yeah,
that's true enough.
What you think,
Captain?
Didn't I find
the prodigal?
You did.
Bet it wasn't
in no church house.
Pea, it's been
a long time.
Thank you, Jake.
This is Dish Boggett.
He just signed on.
I did?
And who's this?
Don't you
remember me, Jake?
You used to buy me
hard candy.
You gave me my first
ride on horseback.
My God!
Well, if it ain't Newt!
Little Newt!
I growed up, huh?
You growed up
good, Newt.
Thank you, Jake.
Woodrow makes sure
he sleeps.
Deets, give his horse
a good feed.
Probably been a while
since he's had one.
Didn't Deets
have that same cap
before I left?
Deets wouldn't quit
a garment 'cause
of a little age.
We can't all be
fine dressers like you.
Pea, you best get these
two boys to work
digging that well.
Well, now, Captain, I...
you don't mind
doing a little
well digging
to pay for breakfast,
do you, Dish?
I don't guess so.
That old
has been cleaning his gun
on this towel.
There's worse
he wipes on it.
Where you been
all these years, Jake?
Seeing the country.
I was up in Montana
two years ago.
Prettier land
there never was,
'specially
on Milk River.
You can smell
Canady from there.
Bet you can smell
Indians, too.
Yeah, but it's
worth it seeing
all the grass.
Grass everywhere.
You wouldn't believe it.
Plenty of water, too.
I'd go today,
if I could
sprout wings
and fly.
Be safer to walk.
Give somebody else
time to lick
the Indians.
The minute
they are licked,
there's going to be
fortunes made in Montana.
What are you
saying, Jake?
I'm saying let's us
get to it first.
Round up free cattle here,
drive them up.
We'd be rich.
Land like you never seen.
We ain't seen you
in 10 years.
Now you want us
to pack up,
go north,
and get scalped.
You were never afraid
of a few Indians.
We whupped them
down here,
and they was Comanches.
You were never a lover
of cows, neither.
Pretty whores, cards,
and clean shirts
was more your line.
Yeah, but I can
smell an opportunity
when it's
under my nose.
What about that trouble
in Arkansas?
Mule Skinner threw down
on me in a saloon.
Shot back at him
and killed a dentist.
Was a pure accident,
but I killed him.
He stood
in the wrong place?
Actually,
he was outside
walking down the street.
A plank wall won't stop
no .50-caliber bullet.
But a dentist will.
Dropped him dead.
It was bad luck
all around.
Nobody likes
a dentist anyway.
This one was the mayor.
Worse yet,
his brother's
the she...
his brother's
the sheriff.
Young fellow named
July Johnson.
He was away at the time.
They wouldn't hang you
for an accident,
not even in Arkansas.
Since they don't
take much shine
to gamblers,
I wasn't going
to give them the option.
Good to see you boys.
I hardly thought
to find you still here.
Ain't nothing changed
much around here
since you left, Jake.
Little Newt
sure surprised me.
Guess I thought
he was still
just a spud.
What about Maggie?
Maggie's been dead
nine years, Jake.
Nine years.
I swear...
You've had little
Newt all this time.
Wasn't a whole
lot of people
scrambling to adopt
a dead whore's child.
Ain't that right,
Woodrow?
Well, it ain't
a holiday.
Let's help them
boys out there.
I swear.
It was only
the Christian
thing to do...
taking him in,
I mean.
One of you boys
is most likely
his dad.
July, get out here.
I want to talk to you.
Hello, Peach.
Where did you get
the rooster, Peach?
It's my rooster.
July, when do you aim
to start after Jake Spoon?
Well...
he'll get over
to Mexico or somewhere
you sit around here
much longer...
Like you been doing.
The thing is,
Peach...
I mean everybody
pretty much agrees
it was an accident.
Stop that, rooster!
Benny was my husband
and your brother
and the mayor
of this town.
Now that ought to stand
for something, July.
It does...
You're the sheriff,
ain't you?
It's what you're paid for.
Well, that's true,
but you can't...
you never
should have married
that woman, July.
Remember I warned you
about that?
Well, what's that
got to do with this,
Peach?
I think you'd
rather stay home
than do your duty.
That's what I think.
I never said I wasn't
going after him.
Oh, rooster!
Guess that will
teach him to peck me.
Well, July...
What about Jake Spoon?
I expect to find him
down around San Antonio
somewhere, Peach.
I hear
he has friends there.
You catch him,
you hear me?
I will, Peach.
Don't worry.
Now let's see how you like
the cook pot.
Them friends
of Jake Spoon's...
they're two
of the most famous
Texas Rangers
that ever lived.
You know that?
I don't suppose there's
a sporting woman around.
Are you so rich
that's all you
think about?
I think about it,
rich or poor.
Get from here,
you pigs.
Go hunt up another snake
or something.
Get!
Sit down, Jake.
Let's talk.
Folks that keep pigs
ain't no better
than farmers.
I'm surprised
at you and Call.
I figured you'd
at least stay cattlemen
after we quit rangering.
I thought you'd own
a railroad by now
or at least
a whorehouse.
I guess life's
disappointed us both.
I may not have made
no fortune,
but I never spoke
to a pig, neither.
In all your world
travels, Jake,
you didn't run across
Clara nowhere, did you?
She's still married
to that horse trader
Bob Allen,
if that's what
you're asking.
You saw her then?
Just for a minute
outside a store
in Ogalalla.
Bob was with her,
so I wasn't asked
for supper.
Any young'uns?
Two girls,
I believe.
I heard
her boys died.
How did she look?
Not as pretty
as she once was.
It's been 15 years
since we courted her.
Nebraska, huh?
I went by there
on my way to Montana.
Bob's close to rich,
did you know that?
Army gets most
of its horses from him.
First he gets Clara,
then he gets rich.
'I god, imagine that.
Him so dumb
he can hardly walk
through a door
without bumping
his head.
Don't seem fair,
does it?
Stop digging
when you get
to China.
You'll know
when you're there.
The men
wear pigtails.
If you hadn't loaned me
that $2.00,
I'd be halfway
to Matagorda by now.
No need to thank me.
Easy, now.
Easy there.
Want some help?
Not from you,
I don't.
Where's Jake?
Catching a nap.
Oh, man.
He ain't changed
a bit, has he?
Look who's talking.
When did you
change last?
Still breaking horses
when there's plenty
of gentle ones.
I never seen
a more intelligent filly.
Look, how
she's watching.
She ain't watching you
'cause she loves you.
Gus.
What?
Why not go up
to Montana?
The cattleman's
paradise, to hear
Jake tell it.
Sounds like a damn
wilderness to me.
Aren't we a shade
old to start fighting
Indians again?
I mean it, Gus.
Why not just...
Go north with the herd?
I tell you what.
You ride on up there,
clear out the Indians,
build a little cabin,
get a nice fire
going in the fireplace,
me and Jake'll come up
with a herd.
I'd like to see
the herd you two
could get.
Herd of whores,
maybe.
You ain't no more
a cattleman than I am.
You know it, too.
I want to do it, Gus.
I want to see
that country
before the
bankers and lawyers
all get it.
Hey, you boys got
any water flowing yet?
It's flowing
out of me.
I lost two gallons
already.
Well, quit work.
Catch
a little rest.
We're going
to Mexico tonight.
'I god, Woodrow.
Where you off to,
looking so pretty?
Just taking a stroll,
since we got
the afternoon off.
What do you do
in Mexico?
We ride around
in the dark,
strike on some
horses and cows,
then we steal them.
Like the Mexicans
stole them
from over here.
Come on in here, son.
Anybody digging a well
in this heat
deserves a drink.
Well, that's...
Thanks, anyway.
Look at the Captain.
Whoo hee hee!
Going to run
her out now.
Going to show
whose horse she is.
Eeee!
You think the Captain
will let me
go tonight?
You're sure
in a hurry
to get shot at.
Any more horse bites?
Quit pulling on that jug.
I want you sober tonight.
Well,
speaking of sober...
There's somebody
who ain't.
Just leave me
alone, Jake.
Go away. Let me
get back on my...
I want to see Lorie.
I want to go
by myself, Jake.
Dish?
Oh, hello,
Captain.
What the hell
happened?
I wish I could say.
Well, why
can't you say?
Don't believe
I can remember.
Jake, you put him
up to this?
No. I found him
trying to see
how fast he could
drain a bottle.
I'll not have men
can't do their job.
I can ride,
Captain.
Ain't nothing
to setting
on a horse.
Better not fall off,
or the Mexicans
will get you.
You men want supper,
best go get it.
We're leaving
at sundown.
Newt, best go
saddle your pony,
too, I reckon.
If that old Mexican
thinks it's
the 4th of July,
I'll give him
firecrackers!
That was a foolish
thing, Jake.
You might have hit
the house
instead of
old Bolivar.
No wonder
you're on the run.
Evening, Joe.
How's your mama
been today?
She was sick again
this morning.
Don't you slosh
that milk, Joe.
I'm home.
Supper's on the table.
Joe said you were feeling
poorly again this morning.
It's living in this town
that does it.
You want
some buttermilk?
No, sir.
If he wants buttermilk,
he can get it himself.
Don't wait on him
hand and foot.
I been thinking.
I better go
catch Jake Spoon.
Do what?
Catch Jake Spoon
for killing Benny.
Now why would you
want to do that?
It was an accident,
as everybody
with any sense knows.
I know...
Peach been bullying you
again, is that it?
Wipe your lip, July.
Joe, run fetch
a bucket of water.
We been married
five months.
Now you want to ride
off somewhere,
and all because
of Peach.
Well, that's my job,
Ellie.
That's what
I get paid for.
If I start now,
I expect I'd
be back in a month.
Well, maybe you should
at that, July.
I think I should.
Take Joe with you.
Take Joe?
Ellie,
he's just a boy.
There could be
a fight.
I doubt anybody'd
shoot a boy,
even in Texas.
I was thinking maybe
I'd take Roscoe.
Take Joe.
He's got
to grow up sometime.
It won't hurt him.
I don't know,
Ellie.
I know.
I'll go tell him.
Better to have that
if it's not needed
than to need it
and not have it.
You pigs guard the place
while we're gone.
They put
a gun on you.
Wouldn't be surprised
if they make you
boss of this outfit.
Better hope not, Deets.
I'd cut your wages
for always joshing me.
Big camp's just
a couple of miles
over that ridge.
Some might think
it foolish,
stealing horses
from Pedro Flores.
He's got the best-armed
hundred vaqueros
in northern Mexico.
They're spread
all around and
can't shoot anyhow.
Most of this crowd
can't neither.
Dish is still
half-drunk.
Newt ain't ever
spilled blood.
I swear, Gus.
You'd argue
with a possum.
Be easier than arguing
with you, Woodrow.
How many you figure?
I'd say 40
or 50 head.
Speak up, Gus.
Talk a little louder
and them vaqueros
probably bring us
the horses...
While they're
shooting at us.
We'll split up.
Get ready to jump
some gullies, boys.
Captain.
What is it?
I hear singing.
White folks singing.
White folks?
You hear anything?
Yes, I do.
I hear something,
but it sounds
like a bird.
Hell, Deets
wouldn't stop
for no bird.
No, sir,
I guess he wouldn't.
Two of them.
They got a donkey
and a mule.
That don't make
no sense at all.
Irishmen.
When did Pedro Flores
go to hiring Irishmen?
 Oh, whiskey made me
pawn me clothes
 And whiskey
gave me a broken nose
 Whiskey-o, Johnny-o
 Rise 'em up
from down below
 Whiskey, whiskey,
whiskey-o
 Open up,
this jar must go
 John, rise 'em up
from down below 
Let's eat
the donkey.
What's a donkey
good for?
Teach it to sit
on its arse
and eat sugar cubes.
You men just
hold steady there.
Murderers, Allen!
Murderers! Heyaaa,
mule, heyaaa!
Heyaaa! Heyaaa,
heyaaa, heyaaa!
I believe that mule's
hobbled, son.
That's why
his legs won't work.
He's me brother,
but smart he ain't.
I'm Allen O'Brien,
and that would be
young Sean there
on the mule.
Sir.
Newt, you run
get the horses.
Yes, sir.
You know
where you are?
Not Ireland.
I know that much.
How far are we
from Galveston, sir?
Galveston?
This is Mexico.
Worse, the part
you're standing on
belong to Pedro Flores.
He find you here,
he'll hang you sure.
Hang us?
Oh, yeah.
Mr. Gus done
got the horses.
You boys best pack up
and go with us.
We're packed.
We being chased?
I don't doubt it.
Jake's shooting off
his pistol like a fool.
Head for home!
Big bunch of horses
coming this way.
Flores and his boys?
I believe so.
No wonder we ain't
been chased.
While we was in Mexico
stealing Flores' horses,
he was back in Texas
stealing some others.
That's it.
We'll run
straight at them,
grab his herd,
and kick for the river.
Be a good joke
on that old bandit.
Hang onto your hat,
Irishmen!
Whoo-hoo!
Not bad
for a night's work...
over 100 horses
and two lost Irishmen.
All we need is cattle
and some more cowboys
to drive 'em north.
Ain't been here
but a day.
Already you've
made a horse
thief out of me.
That's a step up
for you, ain't it, Jake?
Let's get them horses
hid in that thicket
up there.
Don't you even want your
breakfast first, Woodrow?
I could kick you
for giving him ideas
about Montana.
We'll suffer
all our lives.
I'd forgot how
determined he gets.
How about loaning me
a couple of dollars?
Early in the day
to wiggle your bean.
It's for whiskey
and a tub.
That girl wouldn't
take money from me.
That's because she
don't really know you yet.
Roscoe can help
if you need anything.
I can do my own choring.
This ain't exactly
a cotton plantation.
Well, you ready, Joe?
Yes, sir, I reckon.
Well, give her a kick,
and let's go.
Hey, Joe!
Roscoe!
Roscoe Brown!
Morning, Peach.
Hello, Charlie.
I thought July told you
to look after Elmira.
She said she don't want
no looking after.
We just got back
from the cabin,
and she's gone.
Gone?
Gone where?
Maybe on
that whiskey boat.
You mean,
she...she left town?
Well, why would
Elmira do a thing
like that?
Well, who knows...
A woman like her.
Maybe got her
another man somewhere.
But...but she's
July's wife.
She's having
a baby, too.
A baby?
July never said
nothing about no baby.
I doubt she
ever told him,
but I seen her
with the morning sickness.
My God...
On a whiskey boat?
July ain't got the sense
God gave a turkey,
or he'd never
have married her.
You'd best go find him
and tell him
his wife's run away.
Well,
July's gone
to Texas, Peach.
He left
six days ago.
Well, surely you
can find Texas, Roscoe.
I can find Texas,
but how
do I find July?
Now, listen, Roscoe,
she ain't hardly worth it,
but July dotes
on that woman.
He'll want to find her
before she gets scalped
by the Indians.
Now, you see to it,
you hear,
or you'll be the one
gets blamed.
All right, Peach.
I don't know
nothing else to do.
Charlie,
don't stand in the sun
like you got no sense.
Sweet little thing. Mm-mmm!
Sure is a pretty thing,
ain't she?
Aw, she's mine.
See that, did you?
What was it about?
About you.
About me?
You're the only woman
we got.
He would have taken
advantage of the fact.
He won't now,
though, will he?
No.
You took a chance
getting on a boat
with a bunch of men
like us.
You the one
that done it?
Big Zwey.
He done it.
He fancies you.
Says he's going
to marry you.
He can't marry me.
I'm already married.
I'm going to Ogallala
to find my husband.
Maybe you heard
of him...Dee Boot?
Big Zwey, he likes you.
He's going to marry you.
Tell him
I got a husband.
Give me a hand here.
Here we go!
You go tell him
yourself.
Grab another one, boys.
Watch...watch that!
Cut that one
over there!
Get him back over
in there!
How did you do?
About 50 head of steers.
No trouble with Flores?
He's dead.
Dead?
Caught one
of his vaqueros.
He said old Pedro...
died about a week ago.
What did he do,
choke on a pepper?
He just died.
That's all.
I didn't know
you liked that
old bandit so much.
I didn't say
I liked him.
I didn't expect him
to die, I guess.
He was
a rough old cob,
I'll say that
for him.
Fun's all over
down here now.
Fun?
What would you
know about fun?
You never had fun
in your whole life.
Fun is my department.
I'll ride into town
and scare me up some.
We got enough to do
right here.
I'm keeping everything
in balance.
You do more work
than you got to,
so it's my obligation
to do less.
Where the hell's
he going?
Hello, Jasper.
Ain't seen you
in a while.
Is that girl in there
gone and got married?
Whenever I
jingle my money,
she looks like she's
ready to carve my liver.
Never was but one thing
worth doing here.
Now I can't
even do that!
I hear you and Call
are raising a herd.
Well, you're
about half-right.
Call is.
He still
taking on hands?
He'd find
a place for you.
Don't look like
you eat much.
He's with the herd about
five miles
yonder ways.
Lorie, darlin'.
Lippy.
You and me.
How about a poke?
I'm with Jake now,
Gus.
You know that.
Yeah, I do know that,
honey.
When I saw Jake riding
up to Lonesome Dove,
I knew you and him
was settling together.
But Call got him
to work this afternoon,
so there ain't no reason
you shouldn't sell me
a poke.
I told you the reason.
Jake takes care of me now.
Jake's never
taken care of nobody
his whole life.
Somebody's always
taking care of him.
It was me and Call.
Now it's you.
Ain't that right?
You aiming
to marry him?
We ain't
talked about it.
He is taking me to
San Francisco, though.
Think so, huh?
He promised.
I'll hold him to it.
Jake's slippery
like an eel.
My guess is
he'll use the drive
to leave you.
If Jake's going,
I'm going, too.
You'd be welcome
as far as I'm concerned,
but Call ain't
tolerant of women.
I'm going.
It's a free country,
ain't it?
If you work for
Woodrow Call, it ain't.
I...I tell you...
I'll give you...
$50 for the poke.
$50?
I'll give you $50.
Even if you
had $50, Lippy,
the answer's still no.
I tell you what.
Let's cut cards.
Now, if you're high,
you win the $50,
and you can
forget the poke.
Now, if I'm high,
I'll still give you
the $50,
but I get the poke.
All right?
Well, what about Jake?
He's your good friend.
I ain't trying
to cut Jake out.
I just want a poke,
and you might need
the $50.
Hmm.
You cheated,
didn't you?
Wouldn't say
I did or didn't,
but a man
who wouldn't cheat
for a poke
don't want one
bad enough.
Come on, darlin'.
 Sleep, oh, babe
 For the grave becomes
 More silent
 While it's full
 Evil
 From the grave a-comes
 To wrap the world
enthralled... 
It's a lucky herd,
ain't it?
Got a fine Irish baritone
to sing to them.
He sings too sad
to suit me.
Well, hello there, Jake.
Wait till I eat my stew.
I'll help you down.
I ain't getting down.
Hand me a plate.
I'll eat up here.
You sound
plum grumpy.
I guess one day's
honest work don't
agree with you.
Or is it just
any work at all?
You're one to talk.
Where you been
all afternoon?
I was playing cards
with Lorie.
The poor girl thinks
you're taking her
to San Francisco.
That ain't
your business.
She'll go
where I say
or get left behind one.
Why not bring her
on the drive?
On the drive?
It's safer
than you two
just striking out
on your own,
especially through
Indian country.
Call'd never allow
women in camp.
Call ain't God,
are you?
What?
I was telling
Jake here
you ain't God.
You ain't,
are you?
Couple more
drags through Mexico,
we'll be able to start
up the trail Monday.
How does that
suit you, Jake?
It don't need
to suit me.
I don't know that I feel
like bumping cows anymore.
You ain't going
on the drive?
Jake's got
his own fancies
to cultivate.
He don't care
that he caused
all this.
I didn't cause
anything.
Who said Montany's
a cowman's paradise?
Well, it is.
You know the country.
We was counting on you
to choose the way.
I ain't decided
for sure yet.
Well, that's fine.
Let us know
when you do.
Yeah, I will.
Think he'll
go with us?
I'll tell you
what I think.
I think Jake's always
been too leaky a vessel
for anybody to put
much hope in.
Going to town, Jake?
 Sleep, oh, babe
 For the
 Grave becomes...
What's wrong, Sean?
I miss me mother.
Back in Ireland?
Well, don't worry.
I'm sure you'll
see her again someday.
No. She died...
Before me
and me brother
left home.
Otherwise, I'd
still be there.
Mine died, too,
you know.
You miss her?
Like I been
missing mine?
Sometimes.
Oh, yeah...
Yeah, I do miss her.
What about your pa?
I don't know nothing
about him.
Me pa
was a drunkard.
He fell down a well
and drownded.
He only came home
to beat me anyway.
At least
you knew who he was.
Ah, it's me ma I miss.
Don't go up there
with him.
Please. Don't.
I have to.
I'm sandy.
I should have bathed
in the river.
Want me
to fill you a tub?
Maybe later.
What was Gus
up to today?
He didn't come back
till sundown.
He was here a while.
He offered me $50.
Gus always was
a fool with his money.
I turned him down,
though.
I said
I was with you.
I reckon
he got his poke.
If I'm wrong,
you can hit me back.
We cut cards for it.
I can't prove it,
but I know
he cheated.
Should have warned you
about cutting cards
with that old cud.
If it had been
anybody but him,
I'd have shot you.
You going
with the herd?
I ain't decided.
They don't leave
till Monday.
You ain't planning
on leaving me here
if you do go,
are you, Jake?
All of them cowboys
in love with you?
I'd have to kill
half of them
before we got
to Red River.
They won't bother me.
Gus is the only one
with enough guts to try.
Yeah. He'd want
to cut the cards
twice a day.
I'm going with you,
Jake,
whether you go
on the drive or not.
I'm going
when you leave.
Maybe we'll go
to San Antone
and gamble a spell.
I've been.
I don't want to go back.
Ain't you
the hard one to please?
Well, no, I ain't.
I just want to go
to San Francisco,
like you promised me.
That would please me
just fine.
I ain't going to run off
and leave you, Lorie,
if that's
what you think.
I know you ain't, Jake.
Morning.
Morning.
You're up awful early.
Jake,
let's leave today.
Today?
Go and buy me
a horse, will you?
One that's not
too tall.
Here's $50.
This Gus' money?
It was.
Well...
I bet a nickel.
Get ready to shed
a tear or two.
Ain't afraid of you.
I ain't scared, neither.
How about you, Jasper?
You going to play cards
or just sit there
looking ugly?
What's he doing
with that?
That's supper.
Bol will make stew
with that.
I ain't eating
no rattlesnake.
I guess Dish don't want
no snake supper neither.
Hey, it's Jake.
And Miss Lorena.
Lorie, darlin'.
That's a fine-looking
horse you're riding.
Jake bought her for me
from Mary Pumphrey.
Well, I'm surprised
she'd sell her.
Well, I had
$50 to spend, Gus.
Money well spent, Jake...
Both times.
Howdy, Call.
You never met
Lorena Wood.
No. We've not met.
Well, Jake, I see
you've made your decision.
We decided to try our luck
in San Francisco.
We'll enjoy
the cool weather.
It's a hard trip.
Jake ain't one to be
put off by hardship.
We hope to ease
along with you
till Denver.
It's a free country, Jake.
Do as you please.
Guess we'll find a ridge
to camp on,
somewhere upwind from these
stinking beasts of yours.
See you boys
on the trail somewhere.
Lorie.
Woodrow...
Let's go
if we're going.
I was thinking of making
another run to Mexico.
We got enough cattle
to stock five ranches.
Let's go.
Boys,
check your gear.
We'll be leaving
first light
in the morning.
Captain, how far
is it up north?
Up north
ain't a place, Newt.
It's a direction.
Where we're going
is about 2,500 miles
that-away.
2,500 miles?
Now where are you
off to?
I forgot something.
Now, if I ain't
back in a month,
you girls
start without me.
Ya!
You pigs
take care of the place.
It's all yours now.
Nobody else's.
I see the morning rush
ain't started yet.
It will never
start again.
Not ever again.
Don't take it
so hard, Xavier.
There's plenty of whores.
Ride up
to San Antone
and recruit you another.
I would have
given her money,
bought her clothes.
I love her.
Aw, hell,
we all love her,
every dern
one of us.
You know that.
Yes...
But I would have
married her.
If it helps any,
it's my opinion
she made
a poor bargain,
going with Jake Spoon.
Thank you.
Well...
Goodbye, my fine friend.
Goodbye to you,
my good friend.
Goodbye.
What are you doing
in my wagon?
Jumped off the roof.
Here's where I landed.
This wagon's
going to Montana.
Yes, sir,
and I am, too.
Piano playing's
finished around here.
Well,
we got two Irishmen
and a bunch
of addled-brained
cowboys.
I guess we could
always use a man
who wears
a chamber pot
on his head.
Come on, mules. Ya!
Go on, Pea!
Pick it up!
Run them out, now!
Funny, ain't it?
All them cattle
and 9/10 of the horses
are stolen,
and yet we was once
respected lawmen.
How many head you think
we're starting out with?
Oh, about
2,600 cattle
and two pigs.
That was
dang stupid,
bringing that sign
along.
You'll have us
the laughingstock
of this country
with that
"We don't rent pigs" Part.
I figure it's better
to say it up front.
The man that does
like to rent pigs,
he's hard to stop.
If that
ain't bad enough,
you got
them Greek words.
I told you
it ain't Greek,
it's Latin.
What does it say,
that Latin?
Well, it's a motto.
It just says itself.
Yo varum, yo vara-feet.
Yo varum
double feet...
You don't know
what it says.
You found that
in some book
or something.
Maybe
it invites people
to rob us.
Anyone comes along
that reads Latin
is welcome to rob us.
I'd like the chance
to shoot an
educated man once.
Jake!
Jake, stop that!
I didn't hit you,
did I?
I was shooting
at the turtle.
Lucky you hit the river,
drunk as you are.
How's your thumb?
All this over
a little old
Mesquite thorn.
Ain't that
something...ow!
It's made you sick,
Jake.
Why'd I get
such a fancy for you?
Come on down here
with me. Come on.
Why don't I make you
some coffee instead?
How do, Miss?
I'm Deets.
Captain sent me ahead
to scout a good place
to cross the herd.
Oh...
Mr. Jake napping, huh?
He's caught
a Mesquite thorn
in his hand.
Better take a look.
Mesquite thorns...
bad poison.
Deets?
Where'd you come from?
We're all right now, Lorie.
Deets
will see us through.
You full of fever.
I'm going to dig
this sticker
out of you.
I'd soon
cut off my hand
as have you
dig in there with that.
You want
to keep your hand.
I might need you
to shoot a bandit
if one's after me.
Ow!
You best
cross the river
and make a camp.
Going to come
a storm tonight.
Be harder
to cross tomorrow.
Ow!
A storm, you say?
Mm.
The wind will hit
about sundown,
blowing sand,
and then lightning.
Don't tie your
horses to no trees.
Ooh!
Jake's going to want
to rest here a while.
He can rest
on the other side.
Get...
Dern little thorn.
Now you be
shuffling cards again.
All right, Miss.
Let's get you packed
and across the river.
I got to get
back to that herd
before that storm
come here.
All right.
You sorry you
on this trip, Miss?
It's going to be
a lot harder
than I thought.
Well,
I believe
you up to it,
ain't you?
I'll have to be
to make San Francisco.
Well, Woodrow,
here's where we find out
if we was meant
to be cowboys.
I reckon.
Don't look good.
Hold them, boys!
Don't let them scatter!
I don't like this,
Newt.
Come on, Sean.
We got to turn
the cattle.
Get over there!
Sean!
Sean!
Over here, Newt!
Over here!
I fell
off my horse.
Hurry.
Look!
What is it?
The herd's
caught the lightning!
Ride off! Get!
Jake, look!
What?
We got to get out
from under this tree.
No!
Ain't no place
to sit out a storm!
No! I'm staying here!
Don't worry about
your dern horse!
Lorie, no!
Come back here!
Heave!
Heave!
Heave!
Heave!
It would be easier
if you got
down from there.
Maybe he's
stuck, too.
If I had my gun,
I'd unstick him.
Ain't you boys got
that wagon unstuck yet?
Not yet.
We lose anybody?
Everybody's fine.
Except I ain't seen
Mr. Gus nowhere.
I seen him ride
off yonderways
right after sunup.
Probably hunting for his jug.
How about the cattle?
I figure
we lost 20, 25.
Could have been
much worse.
Ain't no point in
getting clean.
You'll cross
the Nueces River
before dark.
That's fine
with Lippy.
Could use
a good wash.
How many rivers
will there be?
Oh, I don't know.
There's a bunch,
I bet, though.
Me, I be wishing
we'd go around them.
Yeah, that would
suit me all right, too.
I crossed an ocean.
I don't know why
I'm afraid
of crossing a river.
Gus!
I found your horse.
He got away last night
in the storm.
So I see.
Here you go,
darling. Whoa.
I don't see young Jake
around nowhere.
He rode off
a minute ago
to track my horse.
Track your horse?
He couldn't track
an elephant
if he was
onto its tail.
I best call him back
before he gets
lost himself.
What we got here?
I'll bet you got coffee
boiling in there.
I do.
I swear, Lorie,
you're as pretty
as the morning.
I guess traveling
agrees with you.
You get any prettier,
and I may be
forced to cut the cards
with you again.
I'll shuffle next time.
I don't trust you.
Who invited you
to breakfast?
Uh-oh.
Jake, you never
was grateful for nothing.
I return a $50 horse,
and all you do
is gripe about
my company.
There's too much
of your company.
Jake.
I swear, Jake,
are you jealous?
Sure, after
you tried poking
every woman
I ever looked at?
Well, much as I'd like
to stay and discuss
the loves I won,
I best be getting
back to the herd.
Thanks
for the coffee, Lorie.
Try to keep
that mare hobbled
at night.
She was on her way
to Lonesome Dove.
I can hobble horses
without you telling me.
Well, that's good
to know, Jake.
Pack up. We're going
to San Antone for a while.
San Antone?
Good gambling town.
Won't hurt to
stop a week.
We'll catch up later.
I ain't going
to San Antone.
I been there.
Don't buck me!
I guess you'll go
where I say go.
Not to San Antonio,
I ain't.
Dern it!
I wanted to gamble
a little bit
between here and Denver.
Go on and gamble
if you want to gamble.
I never said
you couldn't.
I just ain't
going along.
What?
Just leave you here?
Sure. Why not?
Because Gus'll be here
every morning
wanting to teach
you card tricks.
Well, that's true.
He might.
What was Jake up to?
Jake's just up
to being Jake.
It's a full-time job.
It takes a woman
to help him, don't it?
I'll get some
of the boys downstream
to keep the cattle
from scattering.
Ease Old Dog in.
I believe
the cattle will follow.
Old Dog won't
be trouble.
He's like me.
Lazy?
Mature.
He don't get excited
about crossing rivers
no more than I do.
You don't get excited
about nothing
except biscuits, maybe,
and whores.
Mm-hmm.
You was over
at their camp, huh?
Yeah, me and Miss Lorena
always take our
morning coffee together.
I hope the weather
didn't treat her
too bad.
She's fine, just fine.
Good. That's good.
Yeah, we visited
the better part of an hour
about various things...
And people.
Yeah?
Though I can't recall
she ever did, uh,
mention you, Dish.
Look at them pigs swim.
Hey, must not be
too bad, huh, Sean?
I'll go first,
all right?
All right.
Come on, Mouse.
That a boy, Mouse.
That a boy.
Hyah!
Come on over, Sean.
Try it. It's even fun.
Come on, boy.
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah! Water moccasins!
Aah!
Aah!
Sean!
Aah!
Aah! Aah!
Help!
Water... Water moccasins!
Aagh!
Aah!
Sean!
Aah!
Hyah!
Ohh!
I'll get him out!
Aah!
Aah!
I got him!
I got him!
Coming!
Hyah!
Go, go, go, go!
Ground his horse.
Snakes! Snakes!
Newt!
Get back,
get back.
Watch them.
Watch that horse.
Get a hand on him!
Pull him up here!
Unh!
Sean...
Sean!
Oh, oh!
Get out...
Oh, Lord.
Ain't nothin' much
we can do, Newt.
He's been bit
too many times.
No!
Pea, you snake bit?
I think I whupped 'em off.
Jasper,
give him a good look.
He must've
struck a nest.
I've crossed this river
a hundred times
and never seen more
than two snakes at once.
Storm stirred
them up.
All he wanted
was to return
to Ireland.
Yes, I expect he did.
I don't see
no bites.
Sean.
Oh, Sean.
If I'd a'known
that storm was going
to stir them snakes up,
I'd a'picked
another place to cross.
Wasn't your fault,
Deets.
Life is shorter
for some.
Sean was an unlucky
young sprout.
It was nobody's fault.
Nobody's.
Well, you boys best go find
his brother, I reckon.
If you want to sing,
go on and do it.
 Sleep, O babe
 For I'd rather be home
 Outside... 
I'll say a word.
Just a word here.
This was a good, brave boy
with a fine tenor voice
we'll all miss.
There's accidents in life.
He met a bad one.
We may do the same
if we ain't careful.
Dust to dust...
Now let's the rest of us
go on to Montana.
He's right, boys.
Best thing
you can do with death
is ride off from it.
Sean was the babe
of our family.
I wish I could have
finished the song
for him.
'Twas his favorite.
Maybe you'll ride
with me a while,
Newt.
Sure.
Ol' Bol won't cross.
He don't want
no part of it
after what happened
to Sean here.
He's going back
to Lonesome Dove
to be with his family,
so I gave him
a horse.
Adios,
you old bandit.
You can go whack
that durn bell
all you like now!
Well, we're going
to need a new cook.
'I God, Woodrow,
but it's a bad start.
Howdy!
My name's Roscoe Brown.
Is... Is this Texas?
I'm lookin' for a fella
may a'rode past here.
His name's July Johnson.
He had a boy with him
about yea...
Yea high.
I been ridin'
night and day
tryin' to find him.
I'm from Arkansas.
Got any whiskey?
Yes, sir.
I got a bottle
right here in my poke.
I'd be glad for
you to share it.
Come get this
varmint, gal.
You having possum
for your supper,
are you?
Yeah.
But you ain't,
unless you go
catch your own.
I got a biscuit.
Go on. Cook that possum,
like I said.
About this man
that I was looking for...
I ain't seen him.
You fixing
to stay the night?
If it's all right.
I've been riding
real hard.
You can sleep down
yonder by the creek.
Thank you.
You leave
that gal alone.
She's mine,
bought and paid for.
Sure.
Aah!
You heard me, girl!
Get yourself
over here,
or you'll wish you had!
What's going on in there?
Don't go a-hitting
on that girl!
 Fare thee well
 Fare thee well,
my fairy fey
 For I'm goin'...
 ...to Louisiana
for to see my Susianna
 Singing polly wolly... 
All right.
I know somebody's
out there in the brush.
You just come on out
and show yourself.
You.
I run off from Old Sam
to go with you.
Why, why, girl.
You can't go with me.
Janey's my name.
Old Sam used me bad.
I ain't really his,
anyway.
He just traded some
skunk pelts for me.
I expect he's
looking for you.
Nope.
No?
Why not,
pray tell?
Because I broke
his knees with a pan
while he was sleeping.
That'll keep him
a few days.
Goodness.
You're a rough customer,
ain't you?
I ain't rough.
Old Sam was rough.
Well, you can't
go with me.
I'm headed down toward
San Antonio to find a man.
I seen that man
two days ago
when he come
through here.
Him and the boy.
Which way did he go?
Ain't telling you,
unless you take me along.
Oh, girl!
I... I can't take you
with me.
I got to travel fast.
Call this fast traveling?
I been following you
6 miles
and didn't do more
than walk.
I can keep up with you,
I reckon,
and I can catch rabbits
and possums to eat, too.
Possum?
I'm going to follow you,
anyway.
If I was to go back,
Old Sam would kill me.
Yeah, I expect he would.
Well, you might just as well
jump on up here then.
Which way?
They was riding
that way yonder.
His wife run off
from him.
That's why
I got to find him.
How many barrels
you got of those?
I'll get it.
Easy does it, now.
Whoa.
Took you a while,
didn't it?
I been waiting
long enough.
Buffalo tongue.
Ain't that something?
You got a buffalo tongue.
You're the one
can eat it, too.
Who is that?
Luke.
Luke?
Luke.
What are you
doing here?
Me and Big Zwey
partnered up.
Partnered up?
We're going
to Ogallala.
You ain't scared
of Indians, huh?
Well, I don't like
them much, I guess.
I already killed
five of them.
Won't bother me none
to kill some more.
Well...
Might not hurt for you
to come along at that.
You'll be glad of it
if the Indians
get after you.
Big Zwey told me
he was going
to marry you.
He did, huh?
He ain't as bad
as some.
How would you know?
You ain't never
been married to him.
He ain't a man
to be put off.
You know it.
I'm married.
I doubt he knows
what the word means.
I know what it means.
"Dear Ellie,
"we have come
a long piece
"and have been lucky
with the weather.
"It has been clear.
"No sign of Jake Spoon yet,
"but we did cross
the Red River
"and are in Texas now.
"Little Joe likes it.
"His horse has been
behaving all right,
"and neither of us
has been sick.
"I hope that
you are well
"and have not been bothered
too much by the skeeters.
"Your loving husband,
July."
Well, what
do you think?
It's a long letter.
You want me to write
something on the bottom
of it for you?
You sure?
Maybe put your name?
She'll like it all right
without nothing from me.
Well, we'll post it
when we get to
Fort Worth.
I know
I'm slowing you down,
but I'm glad you
brought me on this trip.
Yeah. Me, too, Joe.
This town sure growed
since I was last here.
Darn people making
towns everywhere.
It's our fault, too.
We chased out
the Indians
and hung all
the good bandits.
Did it ever
occur to you
that everything
we done was a mistake?
We killed off the people
that made this country
interesting.
Nobody in their right mind
wants the Indians back,
nor the bandits.
If you like
civilization so much,
what are we doing
riding to the wilds
of Montana?
We ain't riding
to Montana now.
We're in San Antonio
looking for a cook.
Howdy.
We're taking
cattle to Montana
and lost our cook.
Yes. I go with you.
My name is Po Campo.
Uh, can you cook?
Our boys is awful
particular.
Try one
of these.
I fried them
only this
morning.
Dang. That's tasty.
Is it some kind of candy?
Grasshopper.
Grasshopper.
Kind of good, though,
ain't they?
Our boys ain't
going to take much
to eating bugs.
I cook good beefsteak, too,
and bird egg pie.
Just one minute,
I'll be ready
to go with you.
Hang on there
a minute.
You ain't going to get off
down the trail a mile
missing your wife
like our last cook done?
My wife's in hell
where I sent her.
She made good biscuits,
but her behavior
was terrible.
I think this
is our man.
Well, we need a cook,
I reckon.
I'll buy you a horse.
No. I will walk.
I do not ride animals.
What do you mean,
you don't ride animals?
It is not civilized.
Are we not animals, also?
How would you like it
if somebody rode you?
That's why I like him.
He's a philosopher.
Yeah. I hired him to
give you somebody
to talk to.
Free the rest of us
to get work done.
We'd like a shot of
whiskey if it ain't
too much trouble.
Howdy, boys. You
got a good game
going there?
Who the hell
is that?
You got mud in your ears,
or what?
Rye or what'll it be,
old-timer?
Well, rye will do,
provided it gets
here quick.
You durn cowboys
ought to broom
yourselves off
before you walk in here.
We got all the sand we need
without customers
bringing it in.
That'll be a dollar.
Aah!
Now, besides the whiskey,
I think we'll require
a little respect.
Now, I'm Captain
Augustus McCrae.
This is captain
Woodrow F. Call.
If you turn around,
you'll see how we looked
when we was younger.
The people here wanted
to make us senators.
Back then,
we never tolerated
dawdling service.
As you can see,
we still don't
tolerate it.
Now, then...
If I could have
a fresh glass, please?
You broke my nose,
you old son of a...
Well...
Here's to
the sunny slopes
of long ago.
Whatever happened to
Wee Willie Montgomery?
You didn't have to
whack the bartender
when he owned
that saloon.
You're just mad 'cause
they didn't know you.
You're lucky they didn't
throw you in jail.
It ain't a crime,
whacking
a surly bartender.
I guess they may have
forgot us, though.
Of course.
We haven't been here
in years.
They forgot us
'cause we never
got killed.
That's dang foolish
to say.
If a thousand Comanches
cornered us in a gully
somewhere
and wiped us out
like the Sioux
just done Custer,
they'd remember us sure.
There never was
a thousand Comanches
in the whole world.
That ain't the point.
What, then?
Another 20 years,
we'll be Indians.
They be sticking us
on reservations,
just to get us
out of the way.
Ha! That's danged
unlikely.
Well, maybe
you're right.
I reckon I am.
Yeah, well,
I doubt we'll last
another 20 years.
Gus!
Now, where in the hell
is he going?
Gus...
What in the hell's
come over you,
Augustus?
I doubt
you'd understand.
I doubt it, too.
When was you
the happiest, Call?
The happiest about what?
About being
a live human being,
free on the earth?
I don't know.
It would be hard
to single out any
one particular time.
Well, it ain't for me.
I was the happiest
right here
by this little creek.
Me and Clara
discovered it
one day when we was
out for a buggy ride.
I might had knowed
it had something
to do with Clara.
That was
a long time ago now.
Ah...
God, she was beautiful.
I expect it was
the mistake of my life...
Letting her slip away
like I did.
Well...
You've always
got your whores.
Yeah, I guess I do.
I don't know why
you're down on whores.
You've had yours,
as I recall.
The worst mistake
I ever made.
It ain't a mistake
to be human
once in your life.
Maggie left you a fine son
before she died.
You don't know that.
He could be yours,
Jake's, or some
damn gambler's.
But he ain't.
He's yours.
Anybody with eyes
can see.
Besides, Maggie told me.
We were good friends.
Ha! I don't know
about friends.
I'm sure you was a good
customer, though.
The two can overlap.
You'd know about
overlapping with whores.
Know what
hurt her most?
You wouldn't call her
by name.
You'd never call her Maggie.
So what if I had?
It would have
made her happy.
What? She was a whore!
Whores got hearts,
Woodrow.
Maggie's was the most
tender I ever saw.
Why didn't you
marry her, then?
She loved you.
She sat in that saloon
watching the door
after you quit
coming around.
A man's got more to do
than sit in saloons
with whores.
Like what? Clean his gun?
Maggie needed you.
You let her down.
You know it, too,
don't you?
I don't know anything
of the danged kind.
That's why you won't
claim that boy
as your own.
He's a reminder
you failed somebody.
You'll never
admit that.
Like I said,
Maggie was just a whore.
'I God, Woodrow.
You finally called
her by name.
That shows some
improvement now,
don't it?
You want some
prairie chicken?
I ate enough.
I might catch you
a frog for supper.
A frog?
I ain't never
et no frog.
Their legs
jump out of the pan
when you cook them.
No!
Yes, they do!
You got to catch them
and throw them
back in the pan.
I don't believe
that!
How can a dead frog
jump out of a pan?
What's the matter?
Hey!
Where you going?
Howdy.
Howdy.
Howdy.
Could we borrow
some tobacco
off of you?
I ain't got none.
Ain't got none?
I reckon you're lying.
Oh, no, I ain't,
neither.
Why travel with
nothing to smoke?
Because it never
agreed with me.
I quit.
Well, we might
have to smoke you.
What do you
think of that?
My name's Roscoe Brown.
I'm just going
down this road.
I ain't looking
for trouble.
Going down this road?
Yes, sir.
Let's shoot him
and take his horse.
Drop your gun.
Wait just a minute!
Yes, sir.
Clamber down off
that horse, mister.
I... I'm from Arkansas,
and...
Yes, sir.
Strip off them duds.
What?
You come into
this world naked.
Go out the same way.
Ha ha ha!
I got some money.
There's probably $30 here.
I'll pull this
trigger on you
for your sass.
That's somebody
shooting.
Aah!
Why, it's just a damn
little old girl!
And she's
a rock chunker,
ain't she, Jim?
She's done
all the rock chunking
she's going to do.
What are you going to do
with that stick, Mister?
Jim!
Jim!
Ow! Damn you!
Get her?
No, she's too fast.
I've never seen
anything like it.
That little gal
near chunked you
to death.
I'm going to
give her a bullet
for every rock
she throwed.
Shoot this one
first.
I don't want to
tear his clothes
with my 10 gauge.
Put it down.
July!
Aah!
Roscoe,
what in God's name
you doing in Texas?
I come for you, July.
It's a lucky thing
I found you, too.
Who was that
chunking them rocks?
Oh, that is Janey.
You can
come on out now.
July's here.
He's the man
I've been looking for.
My God.
On a whiskey boat?
Well...
That's what Peach thinks.
It just don't
make no sense for
Ellie to go
running off
like that.
That don't make
no sense at all,
does it, Joe?
Mama always
been like that.
She never liked staying
in one place too long.
Any idea where she
might have gone?
Maybe to go find Dee.
Dee?
You mean your pa,
Dee Boot?
But Ellie told me
he died of smallpox
over in Dodge.
Joe?
Joe, I don't reckon
she'd lie to me.
Dee never
had no smallpox.
Mama just married you
when they run out
of money.
They... They's
something else, July.
Ellie's going
to have a baby.
Peach seen her with
the morning sickness.
A baby?
I'm sorry
to be bringing you
this news, July,
but I thought
you'd want to know.
Joe.
Yes, sir?
Where would she
go to find Dee?
He was up
to Ogallala
last we heard.
Ogallala.
We better go find her,
I guess.
What about
Jake Spoon?
I can't worry
about him no more.
Ellie might be
needing me.
Ogallala.
Howdy.
I'm Joe.
That's Janey.
She's shy,
but it don't last long.
You ever ate a frog?
Looks like Jake.
No, it's just Lorie
resting by a tree.
I bet Jake's gone off
to gamble somewhere.
Hell, all I see's
a puff of smoke.
I think I'll
keep her company
until that scamp
gets back.
We got cattle
to look after.
Well,
what's keeping you?
Hello, Gus.
Lorie, darling.
How long's
Jake been gone?
Two days.
He went up to Austin
to play some cards.
He left mad.
He's been mad
the whole trip.
Well, he'll be back.
Yes,
I know he will.
He ain't going to take me
to California,
though, is he?
No.
Don't be
too hard on him.
He got you
out of Lonesome Dove.
I didn't get all down
in Lonesome Dove.
'Cause back there
you was never
expecting nothing.
Then here comes Jake.
Get you
all full of hope.
Trouble is,
Jake ain't a man
to support
nobody's hopes
but his own.
What did you
stop off for?
Well, it's
such a nice day,
I thought
I'd just ride over
and we'd cut cards
or something.
What do I get
if I win this time?
Well, I'll be your whore.
You can have a poke
on the man.
Why would I want one?
All right, then.
If you win,
we'll pretend
you're a fancy lady
in San Francisco.
I'll bring you
a glass of buttermilk.
I don't even like
buttermilk, Gus.
Then what?
You name it.
I just want to go
to San Francisco.
That's what I want.
Lorie, listen to me now,
pretty little thing.
Life in San Francisco's
still just life.
If you want
only one thing too much,
it's likely to turn out
disappointing.
The only way to live
is to learn to like
all the little
everyday things.
Yeah? Like what?
Like a sip
of good whiskey
or a soft bed
or a glass
of buttermilk
or say, uh...
A feisty gentleman
like myself.
Now, you close
your pretty little eyes.
Now, go on.
Don't open them
till I count to 23.
Ok, now no cheating.
Your cheating days
is over, woman.
1...
2...
3...
What are you doing?
4...
Don't open your eyes.
5...
6...
7...
8...
9...
10...
11...
12...
13...
14...
15...
16...
17...
18, 19, 20, 21...
Better make it 27.
21...
22...
23...
24...
25... Don't cheat!
Don't open them.
26...
Ok. 27.
Why, Gus!
Aren't you cold?
Let's have us a bath!
Come on, woman.
Hope you can swim.
I can't swim.
I can float
for about 30 seconds.
Oh, Lord!
Hold your damn nose!
Aah!
Oh, Lord!
It ain't very deep,
is it?
I can float
good here.
Man, this water's
so cold.
I believe it's
shriveled my pod.
Well, it wasn't
getting no business
today, anyway.
Gus, you scamp!
Boy!
Gus...
Yeah?
I'd go with you
to California,
if you was of a mind to.
You would,
would you?
Well, I'm complimented.
Mighty complimented.
Let's go then,
all right?
Jake can take
his own chances.
I can't, honey.
I'm bound for Ogallala.
Ogallala?
Where's that?
Somewheres
up in Nebraska.
What's there?
A woman named Clara.
She's the only reason
I ever come
on this trip.
You'd go that far
for a woman?
You bet.
I'm a woman,
and I'm right here.
You can have
your pokes.
We both make it
to Denver,
I'll buy you
a train ticket
to San Francisco.
Would you mind getting
my pistol for me?
I don't know
if that fella's
friendly or not.
Looks like
an Indian.
How can you tell?
Indians got
their own way
of riding, see?
This one's a...
Setting on an
old Mexican saddle.
I reckon he stole it,
maybe even killed for it.
Go on, go on.
Go on. Go.
You want the rifle?
No.
I shot many a sassy bandit
with just my pistol.
Go hide yourself
behind that scrub.
Go on.
I'll be all right.
You go on now.
Stay put.
Like to water.
Help yourself.
Hope you like it cold.
I ain't got time
to warm it up.
I like it wet.
I know you, McCrae.
From the old days.
I know you, too,
Blue Duck.
Where's your friend,
Call?
He ain't here
just now.
It's my bad luck
he's gone.
If I kill you,
then I will
have to wait here
to kill him, too.
He be back shortly.
You could sit
over in the shade
and wait,
if you're able,
after you and me
get through.
There's plenty
others need killing
besides you two.
I can't wait all day
to shoot two
wore-out old rangers
with holes
in their underwear.
That's a fine saddle
you took.
With luck,
it will last another
mile or two. Maybe.
You bring that tongue
north of the
Canadian river,
I'll cut it off
and feed it
to my wolf pups.
He's a Comanchero
butcher
we should have
hung years ago,
but we couldn't,
because he was better
at riding long distances
without water.
But...
He may be after
our horses though.
I better
go warn call.
Come on
with me, now.
No, I ain't going.
I don't like
how them cowboys
look at me.
You're sure hard
on the boys
that love you.
They've got
truer hearts
than Jake Spoon.
I left that behind
when I left Lonesome Dove.
Durn it, I don't like
leaving you here
with Blue Duck around.
Jake will be
back soon.
Oh, now
it's Jake again?
You were the one
said something about
going to Ogallala
after some woman,
didn't you?
Still got enough light
to see where he went.
I'm going to send
somebody over here to
stay with you
till Jake gets back.
The herd's
only a mile away.
All right.
Newt.
Yes, sir.
Ride over
to Jake's camp.
Keep an eye on Lorena
till Jake's back.
Me?
Gus, what is it?
Blue duck's
in the area.
Oh, Lord.
Sure it's Blue Duck?
I exchanged pleasantries
with him.
Go on, Newt.
Yes, sir.
I'll take on
the chore.
We need you here.
You know
where she is?
Yes, sir.
Why didn't you
shoot Blue Duck?
Hell, he was ready.
Me and Deets
will track him.
He may be circling
to steal our horses.
You boys
best get back
with the herd.
Get your pistols.
Wouldn't
surprise me none
to see Blue Duck
riding in with a gang.
I don't like
the boy going
to the whore.
If I'd sent another
one of these rowdies,
Jake would shoot him.
She should have stayed
in Lonesome Dove anyhow.
If you was a young gal,
would you want to stay
in Lonesome Dove?
Look how long
Maggie lasted.
She just happened to die
in Lonesome Dove.
You don't never get
the point, do you?
It ain't dying
I'm talking about.
It's living.
That's good,
Po Campo.
All right.
Let's go, Deets.
Ok.
Let's see here, Newt.
Um...
Howdy, Miss Lorena.
Miss Wood, howdy.
Aw, Newt.
Uh, hello there,
Miss Wood.
I'm Newt.
Mr. Gus sent me
to keep an eye on you.
He didn't come out
anywhere on this side.
I don't find
no tracks here.
Must have stayed
in the creek.
He might have
doubled back.
Get out of range!
He'll kill us all!
That old man's
a tough one.
I'm going
to show him
something tough.
Hell, you ain't
hit him yet.
I'll get him.
He ain't got
anywheres to go.
Has he?
'I God, that's enough.
That is enough!
Look at that.
He's shooting at us now.
He can't hit nobody
from there.
He's just wasting
his bullets.
Maybe an old man like him
needs a better target.
Here comes anoth...
Look what that
son of a bitch
done to me!
Monkey!
The Captain's worried
about Mr. Gus, ain't he?
Me, too.
I get to expecting
to hear him talk...
But he ain't here.
My ears
sorta get empty.
Mr. Gus will
be all right.
Maybe so.
But he will not catch
Blue Duck.
Do you know him,
Po Campo?
Yes, I know him.
I once lived up
on the llano.
He killed my three sons.
After that,
I left the llano.
It's all Jake's fault.
He's a bastard
for leaving her.
That's what started
all this.
You sure are smitten,
ain't you, Dish?
Well,
I'll tell you this...
If she's alive
and Gus brings her back,
I aim to marry her.
Marry her?
Marry a whore?
Don't call her
a whore.
If you're so
in love with her,
why didn't you
follow her
and leave Gus here?
He's a damn sight
more entertaining
than you are.
So is that whore.
Get him, Dish.
You boys
want to fight?
Collect
your wages first.
We're done with it,
Captain.
Jasper?
Yes, sir.
I'm done with it, too.
Let's get back
to the herd.
Captain
don't take much
to sitting around.
Deets.
This one
I made for you.
Why, thank you, Po.
Is it
of somebody special?
Like a little saint.
You know...
To help protect you
on our journey.
I heard they won't
attack you at night.
They won't attack
at night?
That's what I heard.
I sure hope
you're right.
Ha ha ha.
Oh, boy.
It's awful quiet
out here tonight.
We don't even know
how many there is.
I can go find out.
They'll make soup
out of you.
I'd like to know
what they was
shooting at.
They was shooting at me.
Easy!
I'm Captain McCrae,
Texas Rangers.
I'm coming in.
Don't nobody shoot.
Howdy.
Augustus McCrae.
July Johnson,
and this is Roscoe.
July Johnson?
'I God,
you're the sheriff
from over
Fort Smith, Arkansas,
looking for Jake Spoon,
ain't you?
Well, I have
more urgent business
than Jake Spoon now.
I was about to say,
if you're looking
for Jake,
you missed him
by 300 miles or so.
The Indians
killed your horse?
I killed him myself
for a fort
when them Kiowas
got after me.
I appreciate your
running them off.
We were riding by.
They started shooting
at us. We shot back.
They're Blue Duck's boys.
I'm after him
and a woman he stole.
He stole a woman?
Yes, sir.
A girl traveling with us.
He probably camped
on the river
and sent them bucks
back to kill me.
It's quite
a ways north.
Well, our horses are
pretty near wore out,
but if morning
is soon enough,
we'll
help you
track this outlaw.
There.
You see it?
I see it.
I'll be damned.
The wrath of the Lord
is about to descend
come sundown.
I best go with you.
You don't know
how many there are.
Thanks. All I need's
the loan of a horse.
I'll have him back.
You mean to go
at them by yourself?
There might be
10 of them down there.
Maybe even more.
They scare easy
at night.
I just hope
Mr. Duck's there.
I intend
to kill him.
Look. I can be
of some help.
Stay with
your party,
Mr. Johnson.
You've got
two young people
to look after.
Well, Roscoe can stay.
Well,
kind of chancey.
You might
stop a bullet
and never get to finish
that urgent business
you mentioned.
That urgent business
is my wife.
She left home.
Look, I know
it's unlikely,
but it might be that
she got stolen, too.
Well, I guess
you're no more
fool than me,
chasing a woman
across the plains.
I might have got one.
I don't know.
I doubt it.
Uhh...
Ohh... I hurt bad.
Go ahead. Shoot me.
You won't catch me
wasting bullets.
Monkey can cut your damn
throat if he wants.
He'll die
soon enough.
Aah!
What did she do
to earn a kick?
You mind your own
damn business.
Aah!
Aah!
Ha ha ha!
You're not
worth selling.
The Kiowas
can have you.
How come you're
giving her to
the damn Kiowas?
Give her to me.
No.
I want them
to carve her up.
Hell,
I'll carve her up.
Maybe it will put
some spirit in them,
so they can
go out tomorrow
and run that old ranger
into the ground.
Give her to me.
Hell, I'm mean
as they are.
You better be.
If McCrae comes,
you better be quick.
Well, there they are.
Have you ever killed,
Mr. Johnson?
No.
Well, you do
what I do then.
Help her.
Monkey, don't
let 'em get her.
Help her?
We'll help her,
all right.
Won't we, boys?
Aah!
Keep away
from her, Ermoke.
She's part mine.
Part yours?
Aah, God!
What could you do
with your part?
Aah!
Lorena.
Lorena.
Lorena.
Lorena.
Hey, it's Gus.
It's me.
Lorena.
Was Blue Duck here?
Was Blue Duck here
tonight, Lorena?
Was Blue Duck here?
You killed
the whole bunch.
I didn't even shoot.
Get back
to your people.
There's a dangerous
man loose.
Your deputy
can't handle him.
I know this
is a shock to you.
It ain't
a barroom scrape,
so choke it down
and get on back.
I'll follow
when she's better.
Hey!
Shoot me.
Shoot me.
Go, Mr. Johnson.
Go now!
Shoot me.
Sure was a lot
of shooting.
I'll be glad
when July gets back.
What?
I heard
something
in that brush.
Might be
an Indian.
I'll see.
No. Wait.
Wait. Wait.
I wish July'd
get on back.
It's likely
to be morning
'fore they get back.
Joe?
Joe, where are ya?
Shoot him!
Shoot him!
What?
See him?
Shoot him!
Where you been,
girl?
Where's Joe?
Was that his name?
It's my fault.
If I'd done
what you said,
they'd still
be alive.
'I God.
It's my fault.
Hell, you told me
to stay.
I know. I'm sure
you wish you had,
but
yesterday's gone.
We can't get it back.
Go on
with your digging.
I'll tidy up
the dead.
Well...
Guess that's
all we can do.
I guess he took
Joe's horse.
There.
There you go.
Yes. And his life.
I'm sure he had
more interest
in the horse.
If you're going
after him...
I'd like
to try and help.
He's better mounted
than us.
We got to let him go
this time.
Boy, I hate
to do that.
These lives here
are lost for good, son.
Giving pain for pain
won't bring them back.
Best go on and try
to find your wife.
If I ever run across
Blue Duck again,
I'll kill him
for you.
And for her, too.
Whoa.
We'll camp here,
Zwey.
Go shoot us
a turkey
for our supper.
I'll help you
build a fire.
I don't need
any help.
Zwey, you take
Luke with you.
Luke.
Howdy.
You went with Zwey.
I told him
we'd hunt better
separately.
Why ain't you
hunting then?
I am a-hunting.
Right here.
I'm having a baby.
I can't be doing that.
Not for a while.
You ain't having
no baby yet.
I only
want a little.
Won't take
but six minutes.
If Zwey catches you,
he'll kill you.
Zwey, he ain't no smarter
than a buffalo.
I might shoot him.
Zwey!
Get off me!
Hold still!
Was he trying
to marry you?
You could
call it that.
He was trying
to do me.
I want him
to let me alone.
How'd the hunting go?
You shoot a turkey?
I got one.
Want me to pluck
them feathers?
No, I don't, Luke.
I want you just
to stay there.
I wish you wouldn't
be doing this.
I won't do it no more.
Next time
you go hunting,
make sure he's with you.
He can't
pester me then.
No, I think
I better kill him.
No, Zwey.
Don't! Don't!
Zwey, that's enough.
You'll kill him.
Zwey, we might need him
if the Indians come! Don't!
Zwey!
He's alive.
He'll quit it now,
won't he?
Quit trying
to marry you.
Don't he look funny
with that ear
hanging off?
I'll go pluck
that bird, Luke.
Have us
some supper to eat.
Hey! Don't be spitting
on my floor.
Roy spits
where he pleases.
That's why
I mentioned it.
Melba, do it
in the alley
if you're giving it away.
Otherwise, get on upstairs.
You've been known
to give it away yourself.
And it's about
to break me,
Mr. Spoon.
$10.
Spoon?
You Jake Spoon,
the Ranger?
I've done
some rangering.
He's Jake Spoon, the Ranger.
Never heard of him.
You rode with McCrae and Call.
Ain't that right?
Not anymore,
I don't.
McCrae and Call.
Never met them.
I hear
they're tough men.
Let a half-breed steal
my whore, that tough.
You can't find her?
They lost her.
Let them find her.
We're going up
to Kansas.
Me and my brothers,
Frog Lip there.
Kansas, huh?
Going to rob
some banks.
Ain't that right, Dan?
Ain't got no objection
to robbing banks, have you?
It would depend
on the bank.
I wouldn't enjoy too much
law stacked against me.
Law?
Damn! I want my money
back. I wasn't through.
You can't squirt
in two minutes,
you need doctors,
not whores.
Look, I said
I want my money back!
Made her mad,
by God, didn't he?
Well, let's go.
Some sheriff will be
poking around here soon.
Jake, help drag him out.
He's messing up my floor.
You coming, Spoon?
Jake...
Let's go, boys.
Jake...
Jake, you come back here,
you bastard!
You ain't never getting me
for free again!
You understand that?
Jake!
That's Adobe Walls there.
Need to get us
out of this lightning.
Find us a nice
warm, dry spot.
That'll about do it.
It can rain
all it wants to now.
We're nice and warm.
Real warm.
Yeah.
This used to be
quite a lively place,
till the buffalo
run out
a couple years ago.
They ran north,
every darn one of them.
'I God, look
what I found here.
Gold coins.
There's 5s and 10s.
There's even a handful
of $50 gold pieces.
That's good luck.
Now we can play ourselves
some high-stakes poker.
Now, all that
on your side
is yours,
and all this over here
is mine.
There you go.
Put the cards
in your hand,
darlin'.
Don't let me
see them.
You remember
how to play,
do you, Lorie?
Good.
Now, your bet.
But be careful,
'cause I'm
mighty tricky.
Remember?
Tricky old Gus?
That's the idea but ,
we hadn't bet yet.
So we'll try it again.
They shouldn't have
took me, Gus.
I know, honey,
but they did.
They shouldn't have,
but they did.
They did.
Now, you just go on,
cry it out.
Yeah. You got
a long time to live,
and you don't want
this thing
dragging you
backwards, see?
So you just cry it
on out to old Gus.
You'll be all right,
you hear?
You're safe now.
