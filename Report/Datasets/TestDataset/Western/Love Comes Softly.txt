Ho! Ho! Ho!
It's been almost ayear
since I left my home in the East...
and traveled west
with the man I loved.
I was positive
about my future...
full of hopes and dreams.
Our eyes were always
on the end of the trail...
as if life as I envisioned it
would be just that.
In fact, if someone had told me
that I would find myself here today...
I would have
called them crazy.
I was sure of myself
and where I was headed...
stubborn and full of pride.
I was in control.
Or so I thought.
Quit acting like a kid, Marty.
Get back here.
No. Not until you admit
that I am right and head this way.
- We're going in the right direction.
- We're going north.
Mr. Graham said
to go north.
He said to go northwest.
Don't you think it's strange
we haven't come upon it yet?
Well, we'd be there already if the weight
of these books hadn't slowed us down.
Those books will provide us
with a little culture once we get settled.
- It's too bad we can't eat any of that culture.
-
That 200 pounds
of beans and rice...
that we had to toss off the wagon
to lessen the weight...
would taste a whole lot better right now
than the 200 pounds of books we got!
None of this would have happened
if you hadn't talked me into coming out here...
to the middle of nowhere,
Aaron Claridge!
We both know that
you don't do anything you don't want to do.
For once in your life,
be reasonable.
I'm tired...
sick and tired
of the dirt...
and miles that seem to
lead nowhere...
and the layers
of dust on my skin...
aching feet, aching back.
If I never sit in that wagon again,
it'll be all right by me.
Marty.
I see.
It's exactly
like I pictured.
Can you see it?
Just over there.
A cabin, with curtains
in the windows.
A-A-And over here,
a barn.
And a garden where we'll grow
our own food.
Those trees are just
made for swings...
for all those kids who are gonna look
just like their mama.
I don't mind if they look like their father.
We did it.
We actually did it, Marty.
This just feels right,
doesn't it?
This will be the perfect place
to raise a family.
Pass down the land
to our children...
and give them opportunities
that are limitless.
We can do anything
as long as we're together.
Promise me...
that even if
things get rough...
we'll remind each
other of that, okay?
I promise.
Dad blame it.
Marty.
One of the horses got away.
- Oh, no, Aaron.
- I'm taking the other horse,
and I'm going after him.
Shouldn't be gone too long.
He's probably just a ways downstream.
I'm coming with you.
No need. I'll be back
with the horse before breakfast.
Make up a lot of pancakes.
I'll be hungry.
-
- Got ya.
Hyah!
Come on!
Hyah! Come on!
Let's go!
Hyah!
Come on.
Come on. Let's go.
Hyah! Hyah!
Marty.
Whoa. Whoa.
Miss Claridge.
Ben.
Ben Graham, ma'am.
Met you a couple days back.
Found him
about an hour ago.
Miss Claridge.
Can I get you
some water? Ma'am?
Miss Claridge?
Well, I guess you'll be
needing time to...
to think, uh...
My wife will see to
your husband.
The preacher's leaving
tomorrow.
I can bring him back here
first thing in the morning...
to say a few words.
Oh.
We're fine.
We're fine.
We're fine.
We're fine.
- We're fine.
-
We're fine.
Hello?
Mrs. Claridge?
Marty?
It's me.
Sarah Graham,
Ben's wife.
You met me
a couple days ago.
Marty...
it's time.
We need to start
your husband's funeral.
We don't want to be
starting it without ya.
I can't do this.
You have to do this.
I would...
I would appreciate just...
just a moment, please.
We'll wait.
Aaron Claridge journeyed west
in search of a dream.
His untimely death means
that one journey is over.
Another has just begun.
Winter is coming, and there's
no wagon train heading east till spring.
I don't know how you're fixed for money
to board in town, but...
you're gonna have to make
a decision... and soon.
Well...
you take tonight
and think on it, and...
Ben'll come
and check on you tomorrow.
Thankyou.
Excuse me, ma'am.
I'm Clark Davis...
and I'm truly sorry
about your loss.
I have a proposition for you.
I know it's not the right place
or the right time.
But I figure if we marry...
it'll help solve
both our problems.
You'll have a roof
over your head...
and all your needs
will be met...
and my Missie,
well, she'll have a mama.
I know it sounds crazy...
and the timing is unlikely...
but you have to understand
the preacher's leaving the area today...
and he's not gonna be back
until spring...
and I ask this
only for my daughter.
I'm thinking...
that she needs a woman's hand
in parts ofher life.
I know it's not
the perfect solution...
but when the wagon train
heads back east in the spring...
I'll pay the passage
so you can go home.
You'll help me get home?
If that's what you want.
I'll leave you
to think on it, ma'am.
Get her off of ya!
So I had to be chasing after 'em.
The next thing... Hey!
- I tried to stop them.
-  Hey! Hey!
-
- Missie.
Hey, hey.
Come here.
He started it, Pa.
You get up.
Get up!
Clint says I got a new ma.
He's lying to me.
- Is that true, Clint?
- No, sir.
She poked me right in the nose
for no good reason.
You're a liar.
That is so a good reason.
Hey. Where do you think you're going?
Apologize.
Sorry.
Sorry.
What'd I tell you about fighting with girls?
I ain't fighting with no girl.
It's just Missie.
Get inside.
Go on.
- No worries.
- Come on, Missie.
We need to talk.
Oh, God,
I don't want to do this.
- I just wanna go home.
- Now you listen to me.
There is no place
in this part of the county...
to waste your time
cying overwants.
Your life's
about needs now.
You need a roof overyour head
for the winter.
That's what
you bargained for.
We are here today,
gathered in the Lord's name...
to join this man
and this woman in marriage.
Please join hands.
Will you, Clark Davis, take Marty Claridge
to be your lawful wedded wife?
I will.
And will you,
Marty Claridge...
take Clark Davis
to be your husband?
Come on now. Let's go.
Just answer, "I will."
I will.
Then I pronounce you
man and wife.
Buddy. Come here, Buddy.
I'll bring in your trunk.
This is the bedroom you and Missie will be sharing.
I'll get my things moved
into the lean-to.
Good mornin'.
Saved you some ham. I'm...
I'm not much of a cook,
but it's usually pretty fillin'.
I've never seen
nobody sleep so long.
I thought you might be dead.
Missie.
Go and wait for me
in the wagon.
-
-
Got some things
I need to tend to.
I'll be taking
Missie with me.
Won't be back till supper.
Ma'am.
- She's sleeping again.
- Mm-hmm.
Let's go have our supper.
Pa, is she all right?
No.
But she will be.
Come on.
-
-
-  Come on. Come on.
-
Come on.
And bless this dear child
in her time of grief...
and bless this food before us, and we thank you
for the fine day ahead of us.
Amen.
You got an awful lot
of pretty dresses.
You got an awful lot of fancy things
that aren't good for much anythin' at all...
We fetched your wagon yesterday
and brought it into the barn.
What are you gonna do
with all them books?
I checked to see if there was any food that was
spoiled when I was picking up your things.
We planned on buying supplies
as soon as we found our land.
Books must be
pretty important toya.
I'll see if we can
find space for 'em in the cabin.
I'm not sure what you're
expecting from me.
Come with me.
Missie's nine years old.
She works almost as hard as I do,
sunup to sundown.
Has been for the last
couple of years.
She never complains...
but the work is stealing
her childhood.
She doesn't know
what she's missin'...
but I do.
Maybe if somebody's there
to share the chores...
she'd have time to learn...
some of the things
I think you could teach her.
Things she'd learn
from her mother.
And when I go home
in the spring?
I figure I'll cross that bridge
when I come to it.
The books.
How did you know they were mine and...
and not Aaron's?
Oh, well, a man would have
thrown them offthe wagon at the first big hill...
unless he was tying to please
a stubborn woman.
Why areyou here?
I thought you could use
some help.
What would you
like me to do?
You may need a place to stay, but I don't need
a mother. Pa and me been doin' fine.
I'm a little unsure
about what to do.
Why don't you show me how to
get those eggs out from underneath their...
you know.
Their rears?
Spell "cow. '"
K-A...
Close. It's C-O-W.
Gertie don't care
if I know how to spell "cow" or not.
Gertie doesn't care...
but I do
and so does your pa.
So let's try another one.
Spell "fun."
F...
- How do you spell "warm"?
- Warm? W-A-R-M.
I think you better
W-A-R-M your hands.
- What?
- Well, how do you expect Gertie
to give you good milk...
when you're freezing her
like that?
Probably spell "milking. '"
Sure can't do it.
How'd you get to be so old
without not knowin' how to do nothin'?
-
-
Oops. I really didn't mean to.
I know exactly what you're meaning to do,
Missie. Now you listen to me.
You're not my mother,
and I don't have to listen toyou.
- As long as I am here...
- I don't want you here.
I've got news for you!
I don't want to be here either...
but the fact of the matter is
I made a bargain with your father...
and I intend to keep
my end of that bargain...
even if you do everything
short of trying to kill me in the process.
So the way I see it...
if I can survive traveling for months
in a covered wagon...
losing my husband,
marrying a complete stranger...
I can survive you.
So how was your day?
- Fine.
- Yeah, fine.
I ran into Ben and Sarah Graham in town today,
and they were asking after you.
That was kind of them.
Actually, they invited us all
to their annual get-together.
- Is it already time?
- It is.
You see, the Grahams have a party,
uh, this time of year...
so all the folks can get together
before we're stuck inside for the winter.
We'd understand it if, you know,
you weren't up for a party...
but it's up to you.
You probably wouldn't like it.
There's tons of people you won't know.
You'd probably just like
staying home better...
- don't you think, Pa?
- I think I will go.
Good.
- What is it?
- I just need to talk to you.
Missie's asleep, and I'm ready for bed.
Can't we talk tomorrow?
Well, that's just it.
I won't be here tomorrow.
I'm, uh... I'm leaving
before sunup.
- I'm gonna help our neighbor.
- Fine.
W-Wait. It...
What else?
I'll be leaving Missie
here with you.
That is why I'm here.
Yeah, I... You know...
I just wasn't sure if you were
up to dealing with a spirited...
I'm fine.
Something else?
No. Ye...
I'll be back by supper.
- Fine. Good night.
- Good... night.
Missie.
Missie!
Missie, answer me.
Where are you?
Missie?
Missie!
You better get out of here.
Why don'tyou come down so we can get to work?
Okay.
Just as soon as he leaves.
He?
Just come down slowly.
I've read that they won't spray
unless they feel threatened.
You read that
in one of your books?
Uh-huh.
- And you believe it?
- I do.
Well, not me.
I'm starving, and I gotta use
that outhouse something fierce...
- but I'm not coming down.
-
Buddy, no!
Guess he felt threatened.
Are you sure this is going to take
the smell away?
More or less.
Some of it's just gonna have to wear off.
- The fire's dyin'.
- Could you?
I ain't supposed to.
I could burn myself.
Something's burnin'.
Oh, no.
Oh!
Oh, dad blame it!
- Ouch!
- Let me help you. Hold on.
Hold on, hold on.
Missie, get me some butter, would ya?
- Come on. Sit down.
-  It's fine.
No, you sit down here.
I'm gonna wrap it up now.
-
-  Here.
Thank you.
It's nothing, really.
Okay. Now this will just
take some ofthe sting out.
-
- Pancakes are all burned.
Here you go.
Like that.
You know, you'll get the hang of that stove.
It just takes a little practice. That's all.
-
-
So where'd the skunk
find you?
The barn.
Better get
some more tomatoes, Pa.
Took almost a whole bushel
to get her smelling this good.
Well, I'll see what we've got
for supper in the icebox.
Missie, why don'tyou go ahead
and stoke that fire?
I'll ty to get all the things on your list
foryou while I'm in town.
You sure you don't want to go with us?
No.
She said she don't.
Doesn't.
Hope you can make something better
than burned pancakes.
Too bad I'll be gone,
'cause I can make some real good fried chicken.
I'm ready, Pa.
Mm-hmm.
We'll see ya soon.
Tsk, tsk.
How hard can it be?
If a child can do this,
I can do this.
Come here, chickie.
Come here.
Come here!
Come here!
Dad blame it!
"Pull feathers out
with the grain."
You better be worth it.
Huh.
Looks like a coyote
got in there.
More like a wild woman
with an ax.
Good. You're back.
Supper's ready.
You made fried chicken.
Good, 'cause I was
getting awful sick of panc...
Me too.
Sure won't want to
have to wash all that.
I left half my things
at home.
- It's kind of wasteful, don't you think?
- Wasteful?
To have so many.
You can only wear one dress at a time.
Surely you must have
some dresses of your own.
One for when the reverend
passes this way and holds a service...
but like I said,
you can only wear one dress...
At a time.
My mama made
beautiful quilts.
Hers would put this here
pattern to shame.
She made quilts for all the neighbors
when they had their babies.
I'm sure
they appreciated that.
Folks loved my mama,
especially my pa.
That's why his eyes ain't sparkly
like they used to be.
She certainly was beautiful.
She was the prettiest
thing you ever saw.
Eveybody said so.
You must miss her
vey much.
Oh, Lord.
I'm sory.
-
- Oh!
- Where's your father going?
- On his Sunday walks.
It's his time to be alone
and talk to the Lord.
I'll bet he has a lot
to talk to him about this morning.
- What'd you say?
- I think I'll take a little walk of my own.
Are you all right here
by yourself?
I picked this dress
because I know pink is your favorite color.
I love it
when you wear pink, Mama.
You always look so pretty.
There.
Letting in the sun
will make you feel better.
L... I don't know why
they didn't let me come here, Mama.
'Cause I would have sat here
just like this...
and I wouldn't have
madeyou tired or sad.
I just wanted to tell you
that I loveyou...
and I miss you.
You were spying on me!
- No.
- You're lyin'.
I saw you. You were watching.
How could you do that?
Missie, I didn't mean
to be there...
but I do know
what you're feeling.
Don't say that.
You don't know nothin'.
I do want to help you.
I don't want your help!
I hate it that you're here.
It was fine before you came.
I wish it was spring
so you would leave.
I didn't mean to.
I... I was cold. I... I didn't mean to
walk in on her like that.
Well, I know what you mean.
About last night, l... I'm sorry.
- I didn't mean to walk...
- I don't know what I was thinking.
I can't stay here.
- Why?
- Why? That little girl hates me.
You were right.
She does need a mother...
but I'm not
the right person.
She doesn't know it,
but she's still grieving.
- That's why you're the right person.
- It's just not going well.
It's going just the way
I thought it would.
- I knew she wouldn't like it at first.
- Then why put her through this?
Because I love her...
and she needs more
than I can give her.
Seems like an awful lot
oftrouble to go through...
for just a few months of lessons
in letters and sewing.
Nothing's a waste oftime.
It adds to the person that you are...
and I'm counting
on the fact...
that knowing you is gonna add to the person
that Missie will become.
I know you can find a way
to get through to her.
- How do you know?
- That's what I prayed for.
Maybe I will.
We're ready.
You look beautiful, Missie.
Thanks, Pa.
Whoa.
Whoa.
Gonna catch flies
with your mouth hanging open like that.
When are you expecting?
February.
How did you know?
When Ellen was
expecting Missie...
she'd hold onto her belly
like you just did.
Oh.
I was going to tell you.
The baby won't be a problem...
and I'm sure it won't change the fare
for when I go home in the spring.
You must be thinking
I should have told you.
Actually, I was thinking
I'm glad you're gonna have the little one...
to remember him by.
"In the wa... '"
"Wa... Wa...
Wajon... Wagol..."
Keep trying
to sound it out.
"In the... wagon. '"
Good.
I'm tired of tryin'.
It's too hard,
and I don't need to read anyhow.
Okay. Fine.
- You don't care if I do it?
- No, not if you don't like adventures.
Reading ain't no adventure.
Once you can read, you can have
every adventure you ever dreamed of.
In the pages of a book,
you are a princess in a tower...
or the best shot
in the West.
In those pages,
there are no limits...
to where you can go...
who you can be.
No one will ever tell you
you're too young to slay the dragon...
because it all happens
right here where it's safe.
I guess it wouldn't hurt none
to practice a little bit more.
- I'll be back.
- Okay, Pa.
I think a walk
will do me good as well.
??
- ??
-
??
Aaron.
Pa!
Winter's coming on with
the subtlety of a snakebite.
- It's a whiteout.
- Where's Marty?
- Isn't she here?
- She went walking about when you did.
If I'm not back here in 10 minutes,
you use the gun.
You open the door, two hands,
raise it above your head.
You keep firing
until you see me.
All right?
What ever you do,
you don't leave that door. Come here.
It's all right.
It's gonna be fine.
Gonna be fine.
I'll be right back.
Marty!
Marty!
Marty!
Marty!
Marty!
Marty!
Marty!
Marty!
Marty!
Pa?
She's all right. Go back to sleep.
- Well, what about the baby?
- The baby's fine.
Okay? Go on
and get some rest.
He should never have
gone after that horse.
A man loses a horse,
he goes after it.
It's as simple as that.
Thank you, Father,
for this food...
and this shelter
and this companionship.
And as we come into the season
ofthe birth ofyour son...
please make our hearts
thankful that he came.
Amen.
I love Christmas.
- And I already know what I'm gonna make you, Pa.
- Is it something I can wear?
He's always tying to trick me into telling him...
but I'm smarter than that.
- Yes.
- So, what do you do to get ready
for Christmas at your house?
Well, about a week
before Christmas...
we go to Franklin's
and pick out a nice pine tree.
There's pine tree
growin' in the city?
No. It's a tree lot.
Someone has already cut them down.
You don't get to
pick your own tree and...
see which one smells the best,
which one looks the prettiest in the snow?
Not exactly.
But we find one we like...
then someone
delivers it to us.
Then we add to our ornament collection
by going to Purcell's Store.
They have the most beautiful
glass balls and red ribbons to put on the tree.
We make hot cocoa,
drink it by the fire.
And then your pa reads you
the Christmas stoy.
- Um, no.
- Why not?
Well, it just wasn't
something that we did.
Christmas without
a Christmas stoy.
Well, when you get back,
you have to tell him to read it to ya.
My father passed away
a couple years ago.
What about your mama?
Actually, she's...
gone too.
So, who will you spend Christmas with
when you get back home?
Well, I used to have it
with Aaron, of course.
I have an aunt
that I'm close to...
and... and I have
friends there...
you know, back home.
You can certainly have Christmas
with your friends, can't you?
I mean, there's no hard, fast rule
that it has to be with family.
Well, you'll have
your baby now.
You could spend Christmas
with it...
Missie.
Your supper's gettin' cold.
How about a little less talkin'
and a little more eatin'?
Anyway, the joy ofthe season is...
It's a gift.
It's right there for everybody,
right for the takin'.
Doesn't matter
where you spend it or...
or who you spend it with.
One, two...
Yes, that's right.
- Mery Christmas, Pa.
- Mery Christmas.
Thanks, Pa.
"Where is he who has been born
the King of Jews?
"For we have seen his star
in the east...
and have come to worship him."
- Marty?
- Hmm.
Where'd this baby
come from?
Well, you know, from...
Hasn't your pa
ever told you?
No.
Maybe you should ask him.
Don't you know
where your own baby come from?
Came from.
And, yes, of course I do.
Well...
it's the same as you.
My husband Aaron
loved me so much...
it spilled over
and made a baby.
- What spilled over?
- It.
- What's "it"?
- The love.
- I think that button is still loose.
- Wow.
- What?
- I'm just thinking about...
all the brothers
and sisters Clint has.
There's been a lot of love
spilling over at the Grahams'.
Indeed.
I wonder if my pa could ever feel that way
about someone again.
He could, I guess.
Give me your hand. Feel.
What's that?
That is someone who's getting
pretty impatient to get out and meet you.
Marty?
I thought it was just back pain that I was having,
but now I'm not so sure.
You're having regular pains?
- Just starting to.
- Uh-huh.
I think it's time.
I'm gonna go get Missie.
There is no way Iam letting you be my...
my midwife. Find someone else!
- There ain't no time for that.
- Isn't!
And it's okay.
I'll make time.
- Did you deliver Missie?
- No, no. There was Sarah.
But Pa's delivered
plenty of calves.
Oh, that's good.
I feel so much better.
We're gonna need plenty of hot water.
Run to the barn, get my shears.
- We'll need to sterilize 'em.
- Missie, don'tyou dare!
Go on.
I would rather give birth in a field
than have you in here!
Birth is a...
is a natural event, Marty.
Oh, you feel what I'm feeling and tell me
how natural it is! Now, get out!
Oh, God,
I can't do this alone.
Please help me.
Please, please help me!
Push. You're doin' fine. You're doin' fine.
- Push. Push.
-
- Come on, push. You're doin' fine.
-
You're doin' fine, Marty.
Come on.
I t's a boy. Come here.
You were mooing louder than Gertie
when her baby came out.
Have you got a name?
Aaron Luke.
Aaron after his father,
Luke after mine.
- It's amazing, isn't it?
- What's that?
- This...
-
Powerful love
that just sweeps over you.
It's amazing.
Weather's mighty temptin'.
I thought the fresh air
might do us both some good.
- Yeah. You warm enough?
- Mmm.
- He seems to be enjoyin' it.
-
Hey.
- Looks like we got company comin'.
- Pa.
Go ahead. You can
do your chores later.
Whoa. Whoa.
Hi, Clint.
Let's go play.
Whoa.
- Howdy.
- Ben, Sarah. Welcome.
You're lookin' a little more rested
since the last time I paid a visit.
I can hardly believe he's already a month old.
It just doesn't seem possible.
Yeah, they grow when you're not lookin'.
Blink and you just
might miss it.
That's what Clark said
about Missie.
Clark understands
and appreciates that.
He seems to be right fond
oflittle Aaron.
I think he is.
I bet little Aaron has you thinkin'
on his pa a lot lately, huh?
He would have been
so happy...
and proud to have a son.
Babies are a testament
to love.
They're livin' proof of what
you and your husband share together.
Nobody can ever
change that.
I still see Laura's dad
every time her curls are bouncing in the wagon.
Ben had blond curls?
Not Ben, Marty.
Laura's daddy.
He was my first husband.
Thornton.
I was a widow.
I had two little ones.
When I met Ben Graham,
he had two young uns of his own.
I guess you might say we joined forces
out of sheer need.
But, Sarah, I...
You and Ben,
I just assumed you loved each other.
Oh, we do.
Now.
I got more love in my heart
for that man...
than anybody
oughta be allowed.
I can't even tell you
when it happened.
You know...
sometimes love
isn't fireworks.
Sometimes love
just comes softly.
If you two are through gabbing,
it's time we best be gettin' on.
I will come when
I'm good and ready, Ben Graham.
That's fine, then. Can't say for sure
if the buggy'll still be here when you're ready.
Enjoy your pie.
Orney old goat.

-
Oh!
No! Clark, stop!
Stop! Stop!
Pa. Pa.
Stop.
You gotyour laugh back.
I think I did.
Aaron's cying.
- Marty. Marty.
- What?
The barn's on fire.
Staywith the children.
Please, God, if you're really there
and listening to me, take care of Clark.
Please let him
come out all right.
Please, God.
- Come on! Come on! Hyah!
-
Marty, what's happening?
Marty...
you realize
you lost your wagon...
and all your possessions
in the fire?
I know.
I made you a promise last fall,
and I intend to keep it.
I'll be going into town soon
to replace that feed.
And if you're wantin' to...
we could see about
your way home.
We should put some
ointment on your hands...
and wrap them
so they won't get infected.
- Here's some coffee.
- Thankyou.
What are you
going to do?
The neighbors have offered
to collect some logs and raise a new barn.
Ben said he'd take care
of the milk cow...
feed her in exchange
for some milk...
until I get my feed
built back up.
I think it's gonna be fine.
Pretty much got it worked out.
Just keep praying
for answers.
- Why do you think he'll answer your prayers?
- He always answers my prayers.
Really?
Did you pray for this?
Marty...
Did you pray to have Ellen
taken away from you?
Did you pray that little Missie
would grow up never knowing her real mother?
I just don't understand
why the god that you pray to...
would let such unthinkable things
happen to decent people.
Come with me.
Where?
What about the children?
Missie can watch Aaron
for a little while.
- Where are we going?
- Going to church.
Missie could fall down
and hurt herself...
even if I'm walking
right there beside her.
That doesn't mean
that I allowed it to happen.
But she knows,
with a father's unconditional love...
I'll pick her up
and I'll carry her.
I'll try to heal her.
I'll cry when she cries.
And I'll rejoice
when she is well.
In all the moments
of my life...
God has been
right there beside me.
The truth of God's love...
is not that he allows
bad things to happen.
It's his promise
that he'll be there with us...
when they do.
I'm gonna go back
to the cabin.
Do you wanna stay a while?
All right.
Missie...
would you do me a favor
and get your pa's dirty clothes?
Get. Would you get?
Yes, ma'am, I will.
Oh, Lord.
Mornin'.
Good morning.
Smells good.
Excuse me.
That wet winter we had
sure did make the ground soft for plantin'.
I haven't seen you
turn a page for 30 minutes.
I can't seem to concentrate.
I'm going over to
the Grahams' tomorrow.
I'm gonna help Ben brand his new calves.
You wanna come along and visit with Sarah?
I don't think so.
I should probably spend the day packing.
It's about that time.
Areyou sure?
I'll let Missie know.
- Missie, come here.
-  Okay, Pa.
I don't want her to go.
Eveything seems to be
in order.
You'll be leaving shortly.
Would you?
- I wish I didn't have to leave.
- Then stay.
I just can't.
I want you to have my books.
And this.
My mother gave it to me.
I might be leaving...
but my love is
staying here with you.
Please say good-bye
to Sarah and Ben for me.
I'll always be grateful
thatyou were there that day.
I don't know
what I would have done.
Bye.
Bye.
Might as well get my things
moved out ofthe lean-to.
Okay.
Father...
I don't know why
you brought Marty into my life...
only to have her
leave like this.
I know I don't always
understand your plan...
but I ask you...
with a shattered heart...
please help me
to accept it.
Amen.
Missie!
I'm going to bring Marty back. You don't
leave the cabin. I'll be back as soon as I can.
Hyah! Hyah!
Come on!
I'm glad to be leaving
this god forsaken part of the country.
I wouldn't call it
god forsaken.
Horrible snowstorms.
Beautiful sunsets.
Rich soil.
A woman has to be crazy
to stay.
Crazy.
Or in love.
Marty!
Marty! Marty!
Marty! Marty!
Marty!
What's going on?
Who's Marty?
-  Whoa, whoa.
-
Clark, what are you doing?
A man loses his woman, he goes after her.
It's as simple as that.
I thought you wanted me to go.
- I didn't see the note.
- You didn't try to stop me.
Until today.
Don't leave.
Stay with us.
Stay with me.
Please.
But... But I have to stay
for the right reasons.
Stay because I love you.
I... I love you.
Or maybe...
I should stay
because I love you.
That's a good reason too.
Whoa.
Mama.
