SHANSSEY: Hello, Ed.
- Where's Doc Holliday?
SHANSSEY: Over at the hotel.
He's been expecting you...
Get word over there
I'm waiting for him.
No need to do that, Ed. The whole town
knows you're waiting for him by now.
Before there's
another killing...
Just go on serving your
watered-down liquor.
And keep out of my
business, Shanssey.
SHANSSEY: Your brother came in here
stinking drunk, spoiling for a fight.
- Whiskey. Over there.
SHANSSEY: He drew a gun on Holliday.
Have it your way, Ed.
Check your guns if
you wanna stay here.
Leave the bottle.
You don't stand a chance, Doc.
Bailey brought two men with him.
Oh, come on, honey. Let's cut out
of here while there's still time.
The whole town, including that
no-good marshal, is laying for you.
Right or wrong, they're gonna hang you
for another killing. You know it.
Doc.
Oh, you ain't even listening to me.
Now, Kate, Mr. Bailey came all
the way from Fort Worth...
...to see me on a
gentleman's matter.
A gentleman. Hmph.
It wouldn't be hospitable for me
to leave town, now, would it?
Don't start that gentleman
business with me again.
It was a pure case
of ethics, but...
Well, that's something a person
like you wouldn't understand.
Why do you always have to
treat me like I'm dirt?
You ain't no better than me.
- That's debatable.
- Oh, is it?
You and that magnolia dripping.
Let me tell you something,
Doc Holliday.
All them fancy clothes and that smart
talk don't make you no gentleman.
You are dirt, just like me...
...and I'm tired of hearing about
that Georgia plantation...
...and all them lily-white
friends of yours.
They're all gone now.
They're all gone!
Yes, they are.
Here I am with you.
Your family scraped the barrel
after the war wiped them out...
...just to send you through
dental school. Heh.
You sure turned out fine.
They'd be real proud of you.
Don't you ever mention
my family again.
Oh, please...
Doc, please.
Forget about Bailey.
Let's get out of here
while there's still time.
Maybe...
Maybe we could even go to
Laredo like you said...
...and do something about
that cough of yours.
It's getting worse all the time.
Your concern over my
health touches me deeply.
You know how I feel about you.
I know exactly how you feel.
I don't know...
I don't know what I'd do if
anything happened to you.
You'd lose your meal ticket,
wouldn't you?
That ain't nice to say to me, Doc.
I been good to you, ain't I?
Why don't you think about
me once in a while?
All right, get over to Shanssey's
and tell them I'll be there later.
- Please don't go there.
- Do as I tell you.
I need some money.
Hello, Wyatt.
Cotton Wilson.
Been a long time.
Man, I'm plain wore out.
Hope you got some good news for me.
Ike Clanton rode through here
three days ago heading east.
Waco, I think.
Johnny Ringo was with him.
Rode through heading east?
You didn't get my telegram?
I got it.
Why didn't you hold him?
I have no quarrel with Ike Clanton.
Nothing to hold him for.
Nothing to hold him for?
Why, man, he's got a dozen
charges against him.
I played this whole thing so
he'd be forced into Griffin.
I figured if there was one man in Texas
who could stop him, you'd be the man.
Now, don't go getting your
blood heated up, Wyatt.
Cotton, it's Wyatt Earp
you're talking to.
Ten years ago, I watched
you walk single-handed
into a saloon in Oklahoma City...
...and knock out three of the
fastest guns in the territory.
Ten years is a long time ago.
Getting old, I guess.
Anybody ever told me that Cotton
Wilson had gone yellow...
...I'd call him a liar.
- You got no right to say that to me.
I've bucked heads with the
toughest gangs on the frontier.
Then why didn't you stop Ringo
and Clanton? Why didn't you?
If you can't handle it anymore,
turn in your badge.
Turn in my badge.
I've been a lawman for 25 years.
Worked every hellhole in the territory.
You know what I got to show for it?
A $12-a-month room...
...in back of a cruddy
boardinghouse and a tin star.
Think I like winding up
in a place like this?
It's the end of the
line for me, Wyatt.
It'll happen to you someday,
just like it happens to all of us.
Where is that yellow-livered skunk?
Slow down, Ed.
Holliday's only trying to rile you.
What do you figure's
keeping Holliday?
Doc's gonna make them
dangle a little.
Wyatt Earp.
Why, you old son of a gun.
Why didn't you let us know
you was riding into town?
- Good to see you, John.
- Hi, marshal.
Come on. Sit down.
Cigar?
I'll be a son of a gun.
You've sure come a long way since
the railroading days in Cheyenne.
Ellsworth, Wichita, now Dodge City.
Funny, I never figured you for a lawman.
You was always pretty reckless and wild.
I never figured myself
for a lawman either.
Fix a nice steak for Mr. Earp.
WAITER: Yes, sir.
- My personal stock.
- How are the brothers?
- Fine. Virgil and Morgan are married.
Virgil and Morgan married?
What do you know?
John, I need some help.
SHANSSEY:
Anything I can do for you.
Ike Clanton and Johnny Ringo
rode through here three days ago.
They got a dozen
counts against them.
I telegraphed Cotton to hold them,
but he crossed me up.
Cotton's skidded a long way.
- You know anything?
- Wish I did, but...
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Doc Holliday played poker with them.
Maybe he heard something.
ED: Bartender! Bartender!
Let's have some decent
whiskey around here!
Ed Bailey. Doc Holliday
killed his brother.
The guy was begging for it.
He came in drunk, cheated at cards.
He pulled a gun on Doc.
You ever meet Holliday?
We crossed trails once.
He was a dentist then.
You know, I've yet to see
the guy pick a fight.
Trouble just naturally
seems to find him.
It's gotten so every would-be
gunman on the frontier...
...wants the honor of
putting him in Boot Hill.
You know how it is when a
man gets a reputation.
I sure do.
Where is Holliday? I better get
to him while the getting's good.
- He's at the hotel.
- Keep that steak warm. I'll be back.
You ain't missing much.
It's longhorn.
Holliday.
Sit down. Make yourself at home
just like you were invited.
- I don't know if you remember...
- Wyatt Earp.
Pulled a tooth for
you 10 years ago.
If I knew when I had you in the chair what
you were gonna turn out to be, I... Heh.
I hear you've taken
up a new occupation.
- It's too bad. You were a good dentist.
- My patients didn't like my coughing.
I'd like some information.
The name of this game is solitaire.
I'm in a position to do
a little horse trading.
Good evening, Mr. Earp.
I know something that
would interest you.
You don't know a thing
that would interest me.
Suppose I was to tell
you that Ed Bailey...
...has a small Derringer
hidden in his boot.
- Left or right?
- Left.
I'd say that was good information.
Bailey's left-handed.
Ike Clanton and Johnny Ringo rode
through here three days ago.
You played cards. Which
way were they heading?
- Beats me.
- I thought we were making a deal.
That's what you said.
I didn't make any deals.
- But you know where they went, don't you?
- Look, you're interrupting my game.
Got a real big hate for the law,
haven't you?
Any reason why I shouldn't?
Your brother Morgan ran me
out of Deadwood last year...
...and impounded
$10,000 of my money.
Hmm. As a matter of fact,
you've got brothers
marshaling all over the
frontier, haven't you?
I'll see you again, Holliday...
...if you're around.
- What did you find out?
- Not a thing.
It's my hunch they headed for Tombstone.
Ike's old man has a big ranch there.
But I can't be sure.
Isn't your brother Virgil
a marshal at Tombstone?
That's right. I sent him
a telegram asking him
to be on the lookout
for him just in case.
- What are you gonna do?
- There's nothing I can do.
The trail's ice-cold.
I'm heading back for Dodge
City in the morning.
- Mr. Holliday.
- Yes?
Would you care to settle
up your bill now?
Uh, what I mean, sir, is we didn't know
whether you were checking out or not.
You'll have word in 15 minutes.
Doc, you're walking
into a stacked deck.
If Bailey don't get you, the marshal will.
You'd be smart to get out while you can.
You act as if you wanna get killed.
Maybe I do.
Holliday, let's check your gun.
Evening, Harry. The usual.
Yes, sir.
I understand there's a gentleman
in from Fort Worth to see me.
This gentleman should
have taught his brother
better than to deal
with a marked deck.
If you happen to see this,
uh, gentleman, tell
him I'll be waiting
for him at Boot Hill.
He'll have only one direction
to travel from there: down.
Come to think of it...
...he's no gentleman at all.
He's a son of a yellow-bellied sow.
All right, Doc. Let's go.
Ah, right on cue.
- What's the charge?
- We'll think of one.
I'm sure you will.
Thanks, Harry.
All right, get him out of here.
It's all over, folks. Break it up.
Come on, step up to the bar.
Free drinks on the house.
Give me some beer, bartender.
It's always a mess after a killing.
Looks like Doc spoiled
everybody's fun.
He's crazy, but he's got nerve,
plenty of nerve.
Shanssey, Mr. Earp, what are
you gonna do about this?
You saw what happened.
They had no right to take Doc off.
They're gonna do something
to him, I know it.
- Kate Fisher, friend of Doc's.
- He's gonna be framed. You saw it.
- Bailey pulled a gun on him.
- Wait, Miss Fisher. Take it easy.
Why don't you just relax and
let the law handle this?
Ain't no law in this town.
I never saw a man beg more
to get his brains blown out.
- Please, you gotta help him.
- Doc Holliday's none of my business.
- Please, mister.
- I don't want any part of him.
I don't even like him.
I'm sorry. Good night.
SHANSSEY: Kate, I can have a pair of saddle
horses put round back of the hotel.
That's as much as I can do.
With the feeling against Doc,
I wouldn't stay in business 10 minutes...
...if they knew I'd helped him.
Ten, please.
- Wilson live here?
- Why, no, sir.
They're just holding Doc
Holliday upstairs in his room.
Oh.
- Mr. Earp...
- Look, Miss Fisher, I told you...
...this is none of my business.
I don't care. There's a lynch
mob starting across the street.
That's your business, ain't it?
Don't make no difference
whether Doc is right or wrong.
He don't deserve to be
hung by a pack of animals.
You're getting out of here.
Since when have you taken to
rescuing gamblers in distress?
Don't take it personal, Doc.
I just don't like lynchings.
- What are we waiting for?
- Not yet.
I'd say now is a very good time.
Hey! George's barn!
That's it. Get going,
down the back stairs.
Much obliged, marshal.
I'll see you in Dodge City
and thank you proper.
You can thank me properly
by staying out of Dodge City.
Whoa!
How about that?
BAT: Little out of place for
Dodge City, wouldn't you say?
That's strictly big-city stuff.
Looks like she's gonna stay a while.
Got a trunk.
I gotta go on a posse.
That's what I came to see you about.
Chief Dull Knife is on a rampage again.
- I'm gonna have to borrow your deputies.
- You're always short of men.
- Who's the girl?
- Yeah, who's the girl?
Girl? What girl?
Oh.
I was too busy finding out
that Doc Holliday and his lady...
...just checked in
at the Dodge House.
Doc Holliday?
I told him to keep
out of Dodge City.
I'd better get over there
before he unpacks.
BAT:
You gonna lend me your deputies?
All right, but I'll have to
keep Charlie here with me.
You can have the rest of the boys.
Don't forget to get back
before those cattle drives.
You know how business picks up
when the cowpokes hit town.
Mario, go on out and
get some fresh air.
The mayor's welcoming
committee, huh?
I thought I told you to
stay out of Dodge City.
I like a sharp razor, don't you?
Care for a shave?
There's a stage for
Abilene in the morning.
- I want you to be on it.
- Can't.
The marshal of Abilene
sent me here.
Matter of fact, I wish someone would
write you fellas a new speech.
I've had the same one
in the last five towns.
All right, you'll stay in your hotel
room until day after tomorrow.
I'll personally escort you
to the westbound train.
Wyatt, we've got to
face a hard fact.
I'm in a state of complete
financial collapse.
I don't even have the
price of a ticket.
Shanssey told me you had quite
a bankroll back there in Griffin.
Shanssey ought to know.
He had 10,000 of mine in his safe.
Know what that son of a gun did?
You recall I had to leave
town rather hastily.
Those two horses in back of the
hotel cost me 5000 apiece.
Now, how about that? Towel, please.
Oh, thank you. Heh.
Everyone puts such an
outlandish value on my life.
Say, Wyatt...
...how much do you earn, about
- You trying to bribe me?
- Oh, no. Not you.
I feel compelled to offer you
an honest business proposition.
That's not bad.
- You got any money saved?
- Some.
Wanna buy a small ranch or a
country store someday, huh?
Well, I'll make it easy for you.
You stake me to $1000
and I'll split my winnings.
The cowboys are coming and
the stakes will be big.
Fifty-fifty, huh?
Actually, any number of people would
be glad to back me for 10 percent...
...but I like you, Wyatt Earp.
I like your cut.
Why so generous with the split?
Look, a barber needs this.
You're a lawman, you need a gun.
I'm a gambler.
Money's just a tool of my trade.
Of course you'll guarantee
you won't lose?
I never lose.
You see, poker's played by
desperate men who cherish money.
I don't lose, because I have nothing
to lose, including my life.
Is it a deal?
Of all the low-down gall.
You're just gonna have to stake
me to a rail road ticket.
Holliday, I've done some
foolish things in my life.
I'm about to do another.
I'm gonna let you stay in town.
Why so generous?
Let's say I like your cut.
You can stay and you can
play on one condition:
No knives, no guns and no killings.
HOLLIDAY:
No knives, no guns, no killings.
That's it.
You have my word as a gentleman.
Just one more thing.
You ought to treat that
woman decent or leave her.
Kate?
Yes, poor old Kate.
She stands for everything
I hate in Doc Holliday.
Oh, leave two bits for
the barber, will you?
I found out all about
your lady fair.
Hey, where'd you get the new gun?
Buntline made it for me special.
What lady fair?
Sure beautiful.
Isn't that barrel too long?
No. Good balance, just right.
What's beautiful?
- Hand-tooled too, huh?
- What are you talking about?
- That girl that came in on the stage.
- Oh, yeah, I remember. What about her?
She's staying over at
Mrs. Deeds' place.
They tell me she's got a trunk full of the
most elegant clothes you've ever seen.
Some of them dresses clean
from Paris, France.
She's 5'6", weighs 120 pounds,
red hair, green eyes...
What is she doing here?
Gambler.
Very funny.
Well, if you think that's funny...
...why don't you take a walk
over to the Long Branch saloon?
You'll die laughing.
Hello, Wyatt.
What's the trouble?
Kelly, I'm gonna have
to break up that game.
Can't do that, Wyatt. There's
no law against women gambling.
I know, but every time there's a woman at
the tables, there's trouble. You know that.
- Sorry, game's over.
- Wyatt, this is Laura Denbow.
Kelly, you're the
mayor of this town.
We agreed there'd be no women
gambling on the north side.
Miss Denbow's marker is respected
for $10,000 anywhere in the West.
- We all consider her an exception.
- Not in Dodge City she isn't.
So you're the famous Wyatt Earp.
Lawman, judge and jury.
That's right, Miss Gambler.
Start with you and we'll have every
tramp on the south side over here.
Who's a tramp?
- Shut up and keep out of this, cowboy.
- You're talking to a lady.
It appears the marshal
hasn't met a lady before.
You're in a saloon
playing a man's game.
- Why should you be treated like a lady?
- And you ain't no gentleman.
- That's all for tonight, Miss Denbow.
- Take your hands off her.
WYATT: Hold it, Charlie.
I'm tired of you
pushing people around.
Now, go for your gun.
I'm gonna kill you.
I don't have a gun, cowboy.
I'm unarmed.
Stay where you are.
You're drunk. You don't
know what you're doing.
Now, give me that gun before
you get into real trouble.
I don't stand for nobody
talking like that to no lady.
You stand real still.
And just give me that gun.
I ain't no gunman.
I couldn't kill anybody.
I know that, cowboy.
You were just trying
to impress the lady.
Charlie, take him down and sober
him up and get him out of town.
You're under arrest.
LAURA: For what, Mr. Earp?
- You just saw it. Disturbing the peace.
KELLY: Wait a minute, Wyatt.
- It's all right, Mayor Kelly.
The marshal's only trying to save
the good name of Dodge City.
Besides, I might like to
see the inside of a jail.
Don't you think you better wait
for a few of your deputies?
I might be desperate.
I'll let you go if you promise to do
your gambling south of the deadline.
South of the deadline?
No, I think I'll stay.
Perhaps the judge isn't as
righteous as the marshal.
Well, aren't you going
to open the door?
Oh, I, uh, won't be needing
these while I'm here.
Why don't you buy yourself a new halo?
The one you're wearing's too tight.
Close the door, marshal.
- Locked her up?
- That's right. Disturbing the peace.
- I could get her out.
- Five hundred says you can't.
Make it the thousand I owe you.
Double or nothing.
It's a bet.
I'll be back in 30 minutes.
- Good evening, Charlie.
- Oh, hi, Doc.
Man, this 12 on and 12 off
is sure ruining my homework.
I spend half my life on
that darned paperwork.
Care for a nip?
Doc, you know Wyatt don't
like drinking on duty.
What's the occasion?
I'd like to bail out Miss Denbow.
Hit me.
- I got 19.
- Twenty.
Can't do it, Doc.
She's gotta appear in court tomorrow.
No bail's been set yet.
I think I'll stand on these.
Twenty-one.
Oh, I'll wait for Wyatt.
I sure hope Bat gets back with our
deputies before them cowboys hit town.
- Blackjack.
- I got one too.
You know, Doc, if we was
playing for real, I'd
be compelled to have
a look at that deck.
I'd be compelled to
ask you to try it.
Use mine, huh?
Good thing Wyatt don't let
us go around drawing these.
Somebody might get hurt.
Well, I gotta go have a look
at the prisoners and horses.
- Watch the office for me, will you, Doc?
- Sure thing, Charlie.
- Never could get the hang of these things.
- What are you doing here?
Wyatt, I'd like to
bail out Miss Denbow.
She happens to be a lady.
No favors, Holliday.
Well, let's say you release her
in exchange for some information.
You don't know a thing
that would interest me.
Suppose I were to tell you that Shanghai
Pierce is bringing his herd here.
Shanghai Pierce, huh?
I take it you've had
some run-ins with him.
I had to bat him over the
head once or twice...
...when he got drunk and
tried to shoot up Wichita.
- Not a bad guy. Just forgot to grow up.
- He's aiming to shoot up Dodge City.
He's hired Ringo to make sure
you don't spoil his fun.
Oh, and what's more, he, uh...
He's put a price of $1000
on your head, dead.
What else is new?
Well, I... Heh. I thought it was kind of
amusing, a price on a lawman's head.
Look, Holliday, as long
as I'm the law here...
...not one of those cowpokes is gonna
cross that deadline with a gun.
I don't care if his name
is Shanghai Pierce.
Well spoken. I'll repeat
those words at your funeral.
- How about releasing Miss Denbow?
- Nothing doing.
Look, you made a deal.
You made the deal. I didn't
agree to a thing, remember?
- Charlie, you're working for a crook.
CHARLIE: Oh, yeah?
Go home, Charlie, and turn in.
I'll finish these reports.
Thanks. Everything's quiet.
- Good night.
WYATT: Good night.
Wyatt, you ought to turn her loose.
She's got no business behind bars.
I think Charlie's right.
Let her out.
- Conscience?
- Maybe I like her.
Tell Kelly she's to
play in the side room.
I don't want her gambling
on the main floor.
HOLLIDAY: Good evening, Miss Denbow.
- Good evening, Doc.
Come on, Laura, we've got
business to take care of.
Thank you.
Marshal.
- Good evening, Mr. Earp.
WYATT: Good evening, Miss Denbow.
Good evening, Mr. Earp.
LAURA: Pair of deuces.
HOLLIDAY: I'll check to the lady.
LAURA: Fifty.
MAN 1: I'll stay.
MAN 2: Too steep for me.
- I'm in.
- Fifty, huh? I'll make it 50 more.
I'm in for the 50.
- Doc, it's almost morning.
- Queen of clubs.
Jack of spades, three tens.
- You didn't answer me.
- Three deuces.
- I'll make it 100.
- Doc.
Go buy yourself a drink.
- And I'll raise you 100.
- Too much for me.
Two hundred to me. I'll call you.
I'll go along with the lady.
Four deuces.
Gentlemen, we've been outclassed.
Ha, ha. Thank you, gentlemen.
I think I'll call it a night.
Will you cash me in, Frank?
- Good night. Good night, Mayor Kelly.
- May I see you home?
- No, thank you, Doc. Good night.
HOLLIDAY: Good night.
- Well, how about a little draw, boys?
MAN 1: I'll get my ante in there.
- Good night.
HOLLIDAY: She's a real lady.
MAN 2: And lucky.
HOLLIDAY: That's true.
Kelly, I need Luke Short.
Ritchie Bell and two of his boys
held up the bank at Salina.
They killed the cashier.
They're heading this way.
I sent Luke to Abilene, Wyatt.
I'm sorry.
How soon do you have to pull out?
Right away if I expect
to pick up their trail.
Doggone it, Luke's the only one
in town who can handle a gun.
What about Charlie Bassett?
WYATT:
Somebody's gotta mind the town.
You want a gunhand?
You? No, thanks.
I do handle one pretty well.
The only trouble is, those best
able to testify to my aim...
...aren't around for comment.
I'll take care of it alone.
Suit yourself.
Hold up your right hand.
Do you solemnly swear to uphold...?
Oh, this is ridiculous.
You're deputized.
Grab some gear.
I'll get the horses.
Wait a minute.
Don't I get to wear a tin star?
Not on your life.
Medicine.
For a smart gambler,
you sure play sucker odds.
You're gonna be dead
inside of a year.
What do you know about odds, preacher?
This kind of cough doesn't go away.
Why don't you get out of
those stinking saloons?
- Pack up and go live in the mountains.
- Not me.
You're just ornery enough
to live to a ripe old age.
No, I'm not gonna let
it drain me out slow.
Sure. Play it hard and fast.
Listen, Wyatt, the only thing
I'm really scared of is dying in bed.
I don't wanna go little by little.
Someday somebody's got to outshoot me,
and it'll be over with real quick.
Earp, I didn't come along to
hear you preach a sermon.
You know, I've been
wondering about that.
Why did you come?
If I stick around long
enough, sooner or later
you've got to put
your head in a noose.
I'm gonna bail you out.
I've only got one debt in this world,
and I don't like owing it to you.
You don't owe me a thing. I've
never needed anybody in my life...
...and I sure don't
need Doc Holliday.
You're pretty positive about that.
As far as I'm concerned, you can
get on your horse and keep riding.
No, thanks. I think I'll stay.
You know, Wyatt, you and I
are pretty much alike, actually.
Both of us live with a gun.
The only difference is that badge.
What's the matter, preacher?
Don't you like being preached at?
Shut up and go to sleep.
Ritchie Bell won't be
robbing any more banks.
I thought you were asleep.
No, it figured.
Let's head back to Dodge.
I wanna get in a bed.
What for? They're not going anyplace.
Neither are we.
I'm getting some sleep.
Get out of those stinking saloons.
Pack up, live in the mountains.
- Charlie.
- Hi.
I'll go in to fix up the coroner's report.
Thanks a lot, Doc.
You and I are even.
Not yet.
Not until the debt's
paid in full, marshal.
I hear you did some pretty
fancy shooting, Doc.
Well, it's all in a day's
work for a deputy.
You all right?
Find Kate and tell her to come to
the hotel right away, will you?
CHARLIE: Kate hasn't been
around for a while, Doc.
What do you mean?
I mean nobody's seen her on this
side of town since you rode out.
Should I get a doctor?
Morning, Laura.
Oh, I never thought I'd
be glad to see you.
- Something wrong?
- My horse has gone lame.
Right forefoot.
Hoof split. Better not ride him in.
Leave him here. He won't go far.
- I'll send the blacksmith out.
- Nice you happened along.
I didn't happen along.
I know you ride out
this way every day.
Come on. I'll give you
a ride into town.
Unless you'd rather walk six miles.
Better hold on tight.
Tighter.
CHARLIE: Doc, what are you doing up
this time of day? It's only 3:00.
I'm on a health bender. Up before
noon, take a 20-yard walk.
What's the action here?
I'm picking up the hardware as
soon as the cowboys hit town.
Sure don't look like Bat's gonna get
back with our deputies soon enough.
Where's Kate?
Where is she, Charlie?
It's kind of touchy, Doc.
I...
Yes?
You promised Wyatt there
wouldn't be any gunplay, Doc.
- Now, you can't...
- Where is she, Charlie?
Wiley's hotel. Ringo blew into town,
and Kate's taking up with him.
Sure is a lot of
beef coming in here.
This is just the beginning.
Wait till the...
Look, Doc, a gunfight right now
could cause Wyatt a lot of trouble.
A lot of trouble.
Sure is a mess of cattle here.
Get out and stay out,
you no-good tramp!
And don't come back.
KATE :
So you got homesick.
Well, well, if it ain't
the little deputy.
You've been gone for three days.
I didn't think you'd notice.
You've been gallivanting all over
the country with Mr. Virtue.
I was sick, Kate. I needed you.
Why don't you put a rope around my
neck and pull on it when you want me?
Can't stay away.
Just can't stay away, can you?
Oh, leave me alone, Doc.
Always gotta crawl
back to your gutter.
Maybe I wouldn't if you
ever noticed I was alive.
What difference does it make to you
where I go or who I take up with?
Shut up!
Get your things together.
You're leaving.
She's staying here.
Keep out of this, Ringo.
- You got no right to come busting in here.
- I'm talking to Kate. Take a walk.
Anything you gotta say,
you can say it in front of him.
- You slut.
- Wait a minute, Holliday.
You don't talk to
my woman like that.
Your woman. Anybody's woman.
I'm gonna blast you apart.
I don't have a gun, Ringo.
You got one now.
Reach.
- I'm not fighting.
- He won't fight.
He promised Wyatt Earp he'd
be a good little boy, ha, ha.
I heard you made your reputation
against a bunch of drunks.
Go on, reach.
I'm not fighting.
Well, have a drink, then.
Oh, Doc.
It was a lovely dance.
I'm sorry I have to leave so soon.
- You're breaking a lot of hearts.
- Ha, ha.
- Good night, Mayor Kelly.
- Good night, Miss Denbow.
May I take you somewhere?
No, thank you.
It's just a short way.
It's early and I have to
ride out for the bluffs.
Oh, it is lovely here.
I'm glad I came.
You've lost your poker face.
You look like a scared little girl.
I'm not scared.
And I am certainly
not a little girl.
Why did you come out here with me?
I wish I could answer that.
I don't know.
I'll tell you why you came.
- Frisky bunch, eh, Ringo?
- Yeah.
This ought to learn them once and for
all who owns the cow towns. Ha, ha.
Yeah.
Shanghai Pierce has hit town.
His men are hurrahing Front Street.
See if you can find Wyatt quick
as you can. Get some help.
I'll try to hold them off.
I don't want anybody out
there on the streets!
CHARLIE: Pierce, call off your men
before somebody gets hurt.
Tell your boss I'm waiting
for his personal invitation.
You're under arrest, Pierce.
You hear that, Ringo?
I'm under arrest.
I heard.
Sure are noisy.
Sure are.
Let's quit.
I wanna get out of here.
Just keep dealing.
I'm not breaking this run.
Hit me.
- Doc, please!
- Deal.
Well, what have we here?
A dance. Now, ain't that nice?
You folks gonna invite us in?
Ain't very hospitable,
are they, boss?
You better get that scum of
yours south of the deadline.
You hear that, boys?
These are respectable folks.
They're good enough
to take our money.
I say my men are good enough
to dance with your women.
My boys wanna dance!
Piano player, make some music!
Make it lively!
- Hello, Shanghai.
- Well, now my day is complete.
You and me are gonna settle for
this scar you gave me in Wichita.
Unbuckle your guns, boys, and come
down to the calaboose with me.
SHANGHAI: You better start praying, Earp.
You've pulled your last bluff.
Think straight, Shanghai, before
you get into too much trouble...
...and can't get out of it.
MAN: Let's work him over, boss.
That's a real good idea.
Maybe your friends would like to
see how tough you really are.
I'd like to see you
do a dance, marshal.
WYATT: That's mighty brave talk,
Shanghai, with 20 men behind you.
Let's you and me step out
into the street alone.
Oh, no. You don't
sucker me into that.
Can't bluff your way out, huh?
All right, boys. Take the skunk.
You gentlemen made such a racket,
Frank Loving was too scared to deal.
You busted my winning streak.
Fun's over, boys. Unbuckle them.
Let's shoot it out.
All right, Shanghai?
Go ahead. Draw, all of you.
But you get it first, Shanghai.
And you second, Ringo.
Well, call the play.
I'll give you five seconds
to unbuckle your guns.
One...
...two...
...three...
...four...
We had enough fun, boys.
Unbuckle them.
Harry, Justin, get the hardware.
WYATT: Get moving.
Doc!
Anybody else wanna try their luck?
Get moving. Come on!
Keep moving, all of you!
All right, Doc.
We ain't finished yet.
You would have been, but I feel
in a charitable mood tonight.
MAN: Keep moving. Come on.
Kelly, take them down and
lock them up for the night.
KELLY: You heard the marshal.
KELLY: Come on. Let's get moving.
I don't suppose you want my thanks.
Let's just say my account
is paid in full.
And don't take it personal,
marshal.
Morning, Doc.
Morning.
Just thought you'd like to know there's
gonna be one less lawman in the territory.
That's always good news to me.
I'm heading for California,
buying a ranch.
I'm taking your good advice,
getting out while there's time.
Smart man.
Laura's coming with me.
We're getting married
in a few days.
We'd like you to come to the wedding, Doc,
if it doesn't interfere with your poker.
I'm not good at weddings,
only funerals. Deal me out.
Wyatt.
She's a real lady.
I wish you both a lot of happiness.
You're lucky to be getting
out of this country.
Why don't you try your luck?
HOLLIDAY: Hmm.
So long, Doc.
Take me back, Doc.
Please?
Give me another chance.
Please take me back.
I'll do anything you say.
I don't care how you treat me.
Doc, I'm sorry for what I done.
It's not your fault, Kate.
It's not my fault.
It's not anybody's fault.
It's just the way the cards fall.
I never gave you much
of a chance, did I?
Maybe it could have been different
if I was right to you, but...
it ain't too late, Doc.
I'll be good to you.
I... I promise.
It's too late for both of us.
Do something better for yourself
while you've still got the chance.
Don't let me go, Doc.
Don't let me go back there.
Leave me alone.
Just leave me alone.
I'll see you dead.
- Hi, Wyatt.
- Charlie.
You got a letter from
the attorney general.
What's he got to say?
He says he can get you an appointment
as U.S. marshal any time you want it.
Wyatt Earp, United States marshal.
That's all I need.
These are all dead, Charlie.
Oh, before I forget...
...this is yours now.
I'm through as a lawman for good.
- Oh, you got a telegram too.
- Read it.
Virgil's my brother.
He's in trouble. He needs me.
Try to understand, Laura.
I understand I was
foolish to fall in love.
- If only I could...
- Wyatt, when I first met you...
...I told you I wouldn't follow
you from town to town...
sitting in the darkness,
waiting for someone
to bring the news
you'd been killed.
I won't live that way.
We're not gonna start a life
together with a gun in your hand.
I swear to you, Laura.
I'm through after Tombstone.
You'll never be through.
Your reputation will follow
you wherever you are.
- Laura, he's my brother.
- And I'm to be your wife.
- Don't ask me to let him down.
- Don't let me down.
I'd give up anything.
I'll go anywhere for you.
I'll work beside you in the fields.
But you've got to meet me halfway.
I must go to Tombstone.
All right, go. Clean up Tombstone.
There's a hundred more
Tombstones on the frontier...
all waiting for the
great Wyatt Earp.
Go on. Clean them all up.
Go on!
I love you, Laura.
I love you, Wyatt.
Good afternoon, marshal.
Out for a little ride?
About 700 miles' worth. Tombstone.
Tombstone, huh?
I'm heading that way myself.
I understand the climate down
there may be better for my cough.
Since when have you gotten
interested in your health?
Well, it's really a matter of finances.
The deck's gone cold here.
Nobody will give me any play.
Mind if I ride along?
It's a free country. Hop on.
Where's your gear?
Whoa, whoa. Whoa.
Well, thanks for the ride.
Sell my horse and get a good price.
Doc.
I know. No knives,
no guns, no killing.
Man, that's good.
I just about forgot what a
home-cooked meal tastes like.
Betty, I'm gonna steal
you away from Virgil.
By golly, Wyatt, you're gonna
be the only single one left.
I got a family going in Deadwood.
Even little Jimmy here's tying the
knot when he gets back to California.
What do you mean, "little Jimmy"?
I'll be 19 next month.
Nineteen.
Say, when are you gonna
get hitched, Wyatt?
Cigar?
There's the signal for women and
children to leave the room.
Come on, Tommy.
It's your bedtime now.
Aw, Mom, do I have to?
Yes, you do. Your uncles
will all be here tomorrow.
TOMMY: Good night, Uncle Wyatt.
- Good night, Tommy.
TOMMY: Good night, Uncle Morgan.
- Good night, son.
- Good night, Uncle James.
JIMMY: Good night, Tommy.
- Good night, Daddy.
- Good night, son.
It's nice to have you here.
I only wish it were under
happier circumstances.
She seems pretty upset.
Well, she's been after me for
a year to quit marshaling.
You know how women are.
All right. Now, let's get
down to business.
Now, Morgan and Jimmy
know the setup here.
Now, Wyatt, you know Ike Clanton
has a ranch outside city limits.
Yes, I know.
He's organized the toughest bunch
of gunslingers you ever laid eyes on.
He owns the county sheriff.
- Who is he?
- Cotton Wilson.
Cotton Wilson.
So Ike paid off on his deal.
Clanton's been rustling Mexican
cattle by the thousands.
And he has to move them.
He can only ship them
out of Tombstone,
and he can't do that while
we control the city.
That's about it.
He's organized, and he's mean.
We can't keep him out
of Tombstone forever.
What about the
people of Tombstone?
John Clum, editor of the
and some of the leading citizens will back
us if they know you're calling the shots.
We're all agreed, Wyatt.
You should run the show.
There's only one thing
that bothers me...
...and I wanna speak my piece now.
There's gonna be a lot of bad talk
about you riding with Doc Holliday.
What about Holliday?
MORGAN: He's the worst killer on the
frontier, that's what about him.
It just don't look good,
you coming here with him.
Holliday saved my life in Dodge City.
I don't forget that.
What's more,
he's a man of his word.
As long as he plays his cards
straight and keeps out of killings...
...we got no right to
run him out of town.
I didn't know you
two were a team.
We're not. It's just
a case of square deal.
Holliday stays.
All right, Wyatt.
He's your responsibility.
That suits me fine. Do we
have a map of the county?
The first thing we
gotta do is let the
Clantons know that the
city is closed to them.
Then we gotta control the county.
Now, that's important.
I'm gonna get a letter
off to a man tonight
who'll take care of
that matter for us.
- Now show me where the Clanton ranch is.
- Here.
Where does he keep his men?
Hello, Cotton.
I've been expecting you.
You're looking fine,
real prosperous.
- Oh, I ain't complaining.
- What's on your mind?
Wyatt, Ike wants to make you a deal.
He promises no trouble...
...if you let him ship his
cattle out of Tombstone.
- Well, that's mighty nice of Ike.
- Ike's a nice fella.
He's got a fortune tied up in
cattle out there at the ranch...
...and he's gonna move them.
- Oh, he is, huh?
There's $20,000 in
it for you, cash.
Twenty thousand dollars?
The wages of sin are rising.
Twenty thousand against
a 6-foot hole in Boot Hill...
...or a $20-a-month pension if you
live long enough to collect it.
I've thought about those things.
You know, Cotton...
...this is a nice little town,
a good place to set a while.
I might even run for county
sheriff in a couple of months.
That don't scare me at all.
I got mine.
I got a ranch now and 25,000 in
the bank, and you know something?
It don't bother my sleep,
not one bit.
It would mine, though.
Why don't you get off that pulpit, Wyatt?
Ellsworth, Wichita, Dodge City.
What have they got you but a life full of
misery and a woman who walked out on you...
...and the friendship of a killer?
Take this message
back to your boss.
So that's the way he wants it, huh?
He aims to pull the town
out from under you, Ike.
MAN :
- Been a long time, Ike.
- Too long.
Hello, Ringo. Still renting
your gun to the highest bidder?
That's right, marshal.
Ain't you a little young
to be packing a gun, son?
Why don't you try me?
Going someplace?
We're taking in the show, marshal.
Any objections?
Nope. Soon as you check
in your sidearms.
Why don't you check it
in for me, marshal?
Now!
You boys know my brothers.
Meet John Clum, head of
the citizens' committee.
You're a marked man, Wyatt.
There's no place in
this town for you, Ike.
The next time you ride in armed,
you ride out feet first.
Now, get moving.
IKE: Hyah!
- Here comes trouble.
- Who is she?
That's Kate Fisher.
She just couldn't stay away.
Call, you suckers.
Barkeep, some whiskey down here.
Leave the bottle.
MAN: Two pair. Aces up.
Hey, Doc, what have you got?
Three treys.
Nice town, huh, Kate?
Well, well, well.
If it ain't the little deputy.
MAN: Doc, your deal.
Ain't you gonna say
hello to an old friend?
Draw.
I'll have some creme de menthe.
Hey, little deputy...
...wouldn't you like to
have another drink with me?
You're drunk, Ringo.
That's the way you made
your reputation, wasn't it?
Against drunks?
Get your gun. I'll meet you
in the street in five minutes.
I'll be there.
I said I'd see you dead.
What kind of a sucker play is this?
It's all Clanton needs to start a war.
I've had it up to here. You wanna
play patty-cake with them, go ahead.
Give me your gun, Doc.
You've got no right packing it.
Now, you can...
You can thank God you're
Wyatt Earp's brother.
Holliday, if you think anything about
Wyatt, you'll get out of here.
Having a killer like you around is the
worst thing that can happen to him.
- I hear you're leaving Tombstone.
- You hear good.
I'm taking the stage tomorrow.
I thought this climate
was good for your cough.
Listen, preacher...
...being here's caused me
a lot of embarrassment.
Some people are even
taking me as a lawman.
You're not leaving on my account?
Your account?
You got nothing to
do with my leaving.
WYATT: Good luck, Doc.
Too bad we won't be in
on the finish together.
JOHN: Hi, Wyatt.
Here's that letter
you've been waiting for.
What have we got here?
Young Clanton passed out
drunk at the Alhambra.
Throw him in the tank.
Let him sleep it off.
WYATT: Hold it a minute.
John, how long is it gonna take
to get those men you promised?
Any time you say.
I think I'll take a trip
out to the Clanton ranch.
- Are you crazy?
- I don't think so.
VIRGIL: Take your gun.
- This is all the ammunition I'll need.
If I'm not back in a
couple hours, Virge...
...have Clum's citizens'
committee drag my carcass out.
Whoa, whoa.
- Billy!
WYATT: He's all right, ma'am.
Just got himself a
little liquored up.
All right, on your feet.
Billy! You get in the house.
I don't know what I'm
gonna do with that boy.
Way he's going now, he's gonna
end up like his father...
...shot down for stealing cattle.
You think you're pretty
tough, don't you, son?
I never saw a gunslinger yet so tough
he lived to celebrate his 35th birthday.
I learned one rule
about gunslingers.
There's always a man faster
on the draw than you are.
And the more you use a gun, the sooner
you're gonna run into that man.
You think I don't know
what's inside of you.
I had a couple of big brothers.
They fought in the Civil War,
and I was too young to go.
I tried to live up to them the same way
you're trying to live up to Ike and Finn.
- You know about that, huh?
- You can bet I know about that.
It's not that I wanna be a
gunfighter, exactly. It's just...
I don't know,
sometimes I get lonely.
All gunfighters are lonely.
They live in fear.
They die without a dime
or a woman or a friend.
You know, I never thought
about it like that.
WYATT: Well, think about it.
Think about it.
Billy, listen to the marshal.
- I won't do it no more, Ma.
- Oh, Billy.
What are you doing here?
Just brought your kid
brother home, drunk.
You should be proud, real proud.
You better get riding.
I wouldn't do that, Ike.
My friends in Tombstone might begin
to worry if I'm not back soon.
That don't cut no ice with me, Wyatt.
You're out of your territory this time.
Am I?
My appointment,
United States marshal.
Sorry to disappoint you.
Now, wait a minute, Wyatt.
I'm not looking for a fight,
but you gotta stop pushing me.
Why don't we sit down and talk it over?
I'll make you any kind of deal you ask.
The only deal I want is for you to
run that stolen herd back to Mexico.
Hyah!
- Did you see the judge?
- I seen him.
Well?
There's no legal way you can keep a
United States marshal out of the county.
The judge was packing up
to leave when I got there.
I think it's about time we
all pack up and leave, Ike.
Shut up, Frank.
Only one thing we can do.
We didn't have no trouble
till that Wyatt Earp got here.
You're making sense now, Ike.
All right.
We got no choice.
We'll ambush him tonight.
Ain't you forgetting about
the rest of the Earps?
Now, look, we can handle the Earps
if we make this a personal fight.
- What if they bring in Clum?
- They won't. They're too proud.
They're gonna come to
us the way we want.
It's a law, bigger than
any law in the books.
Family pride.
We'll get that Wyatt when
he makes his late round.
Don't make no difference to me.
Tired?
Yeah. I guess I must
have dozed a little.
Betty sent some coffee.
Well, that's gonna hit the spot.
JIMMY: It's awful quiet.
Too quiet.
Wyatt, do you figure we're gonna have
to fight it out with the Clantons?
I wish I knew, Jimmy.
Maybe Ike will see how
hopeless it all is.
You itching to get
back to California?
I think about it all the time.
- She must be quite a girl.
- Yes, she is.
Well...
...I better get to work.
Look, how about letting me make
the rounds for you tonight?
I get awful lonesome sitting here
with nothing to do but think.
Sure, you go ahead.
I could use some sleep.
At least when I'm making the rounds,
it gives me something else to think about.
Ike's called the play.
We'll do it his way now.
Don't do that, Wyatt.
That's what they want.
Don't let them push you
into a personal fight.
That's mighty funny
coming from you.
You're a lawman, Wyatt.
Don't throw away a lifetime's work.
- Where's your logic?
- To hell with logic!
That's my brother lying there.
- Who is it?
HOLLIDAY: Open the door!
- Start talking, Kate.
- Doc...
...I don't know nothing about it.
Talk.
Why?
What difference does it make now?
I sure messed everything
up real good, ain't I?
I wanted you back...
...because I love you.
And I thought if Wyatt was out of
the way, you'd come back to me.
That's why I kept quiet when I...
When I heard them.
I must've been out of my mind.
Where?
The Clanton ranch.
Who was there?
- I didn't want that boy to be killed.
- Who was there?
Ike, Finn...
...Cotton Wilson and
the MacLowerys.
And Ringo?
Was Ringo there?
Yes. Ringo was there.
Doc.
- Don't, Doc.
- Oh, please don't, Doc.
Doc!
Please don't, Doc.
Please don't kill me.
Please. Please!
Please!
Don't kill me!
Doc.
Doc.
Doc.
Doc.
Oh, Doc.
It's all right, honey.
It's all right, honey.
Wyatt. Ike sent me.
I didn't have nothing
to do with it.
I didn't know nothing.
You gotta believe me.
I guess it's just because
your name is Clanton.
Ike sent me to see you.
He wants to meet with you
and your family personal.
- I've been expecting it.
- With no interference from Clum.
You have my word.
How many men is he bringing?
Six.
There'll be Ike and Finn and
Ringo and the MacLowerys.
Where and when?
Sunup at O.K. Corral.
You tell Ike we'll be there.
You said six.
I'll be coming with them.
Don't do it, Billy.
Give yourself a chance to live.
No. I thought about it.
I thought real hard about it.
No, sir, I can't run.
Ike and Finn are my brothers.
You understand that, don't you?
Yes, Billy, I understand that.
How can you sit there like
you're playing checkers?
How can you sit there like that?
What's the matter with you?
Why don't you go to John
Clum and ask for some help?
I told you, this is
not Clum's affair.
This is personal, between
us and Ike Clanton.
But you're lawmen. You are
lawmen, all three of you.
You have no right to put yourselves
above the safety of this town.
Your duty is to the people,
not to your own pride.
Proud, proud men.
Look at you.
Look at the proud men.
Morgan.
Does your wife know she'll
be a widow tomorrow?
I think you'd better
leave the room.
Virgil, your son wants
to kiss you good night.
WYATT: See you in the morning.
Doc, wake up.
Doc, it's me, Wyatt.
Wake up, do you hear me?
You drunken sot.
I need you, Doc. Don't let me down.
Wake up, do you hear me?
Wake up.
KATE: Leave him alone.
Can't you see he's dying?
HOLLIDAY: Leave them alone.
Doc.
How do you feel?
The fight's this morning...
...isn't it?
What?
I don't know.
Doc, you can't.
You can't.
Doc, you can't.
Look, you can't even stand up!
You're gonna die for sure
if you go out there.
If I'm going to die, at least let me
die with the only friend I ever had.
We don't make no difference, huh?
You and I?
We don't matter, Kate.
We haven't mattered since
the day we were born.
- Get the horses around back.
- Right.
Hyah!
Get going, Cotton.
Frank, take the rifle.
Get inside the wagon.
Up front.
Morgan and Virgil are waiting.
Ike wants to talk to you alone.
- He's unarmed.
- Wait a minute, Wyatt.
Kate told me about the
killing of your brother.
It was the Clantons, all right.
And you were in on it.
- I had nothing to do with it.
- Get back where you belong.
- Believe me, Wyatt...
- Get back with your friends.
They're coming.
They got Doc Holliday with them.
Holliday, huh?
IKE: Cotton, you get
over with the horses.
Ike, I can't take this
kind of gunplay anymore.
- Let me out.
- Get over there.
There's seven of them with Cotton.
I only see six.
Spread.
Frank.
Hit the dirt!
Cover me.
Shotgun!
- Are you all right?
- All right.
All right.
Cotton!
You chicken-livered, miserable...
They killed my brother!
Tom! Stay back, you fool!
Come on, Earp! I'll kill you!
Come out and get it, Earp!
Earp! Come out and get it!
Virge. Hurt bad?
Yeah. My le... My legs.
Doc.
I'll take care of Ringo.
Billy.
Throw down your gun
and come on out.
Give up, boy!
You haven't got a chance!
BILLY: Come in and get me.
Come in and get me!
Don't make me do it, boy.
Don't make me do it.
I'm shoving off, Doc.
How are the brothers?
Coming along fine.
They're gonna be all right.
Another glass, Joe.
I just want you to know I'd
have never made it without you.
- Where you heading?
- California.
Laura?
I don't know. I hope so.
She'll be waiting.
Will you listen to
me for just once?
Will you get up to that
hospital in Denver?
At this rate, you can't last
more than a couple of months.
Are you crazy?
And give up this winning streak?
I'll see you around.
So long, preacher.
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
- Hello, Doc.
- Hi, Doc.
What's the name of this game?
