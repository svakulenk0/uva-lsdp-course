As far as I'm concerned,
you have my blessing.
Thank you, sir.
The rest is up to you.
May I suggest the garden
at the west side of the house?
It's a very romantic spot.
I'd like you to meet an old friend of mine.
Dr. Alan Bent. Meriwether Lewis.
-Doctor.
-How do you do?
Mr. Lewis is here from Washington.
He's Mr. Jefferson's secretary.
I trust the President is in good health.
He's very well, thank you.
Will you gentlemen excuse me?
I was wondering, Julia,
if you'd care to take a walk in the garden.
I was hoping
you were going to ask me to dance.
-Would you excuse us, Mrs. Hancock?
-Certainly.
Julia, couldn't we go outside for a minute?
I thought you liked to dance.
Well, it's....
I have something to say to you.
It's important.
I have something important to tell you.
Your friend Mr. Clark is coming here tonight.
Bill Clark, coming here?
It was Father's idea.
He thought it'd be a nice surprise for you.
I haven't seen Bill
since I got out of the Army.
I want you to tell me all about him.
That is indeed wonderful news.
I must tell my guests.
Orchestra!
Ladies and gentlemen...
Mr. Collins has brought us news
that I'm eager to share with you.
The Congress has approved
President Jefferson's purchase...
of the Louisiana Territory.
The President has acquired...
more than doubling the size
of the United States.
Ladies and gentlemen...
I hope that you will drink a toast with me...
to this healthy young country of ours.
Orchestra!
-Good evening, Lieutenant.
-Good evening.
-Lieutenant, this is a great pleasure.
-Mr. Hancock.
My dear, may I present Lt. Clark?
Mrs. Hancock.
-Lt. Clark.
-My pleasure, ma'am.
-Mr. Collins, Lt. Clark.
-Your servant, sir.
Thank you.
Will you take punch with us, Lieutenant?
Nothing I'd like better.
There's Bill now.
It's good to see you.
Merne, what are you doing
out of Washington?
Well, I....
I'm sorry.
Julia, may I present Bill Clark?
Bill, Miss Julia Hancock.
-Miss Hancock.
-How do you do?
You'll have to forgive the Lieutenant's
appearance. He's been fighting Indians.
So I understand.
What about you,
still running the White House?
Well, I get a little help from Mr. Jefferson.
-Come and meet our friends, Lieutenant.
-Yes, I'd like to.
-I'll join you right after this dance, Bill.
-That's fine.
Miss Hancock.
Mr. Lewis, a soldier just come
from Washington with this message.
-Thank you.
-He's waiting outside.
Pardon me, Julia.
It's Mr. Jefferson.
He wants me back at the White House.
-Tell him I'll leave within the hour.
-Yes, sir.
It says, ''I'm sure you appreciate
I would not call you back...
''from your vacation
except for a matter of utmost urgency.
''Please convey my apologies
to Mr. and Mrs. Hancock...
''and especially to Miss Julia.''
I wish you didn't have
to leave tonight, Merne.
So do I.
-Goodbye, Mrs. Hancock.
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye, sir. Thank you for everything.
-Good luck.
Goodbye, Julia.
-You come back as soon as you can.
-Of course.
Take care of yourself, Bill.
-Safe trip, sir.
-Goodbye, Tom.
Seems a shame Merne's visit
had to be cut so short.
Yes, indeed.
You must plan to spend
a few days with us, Lieutenant.
By all means.
Thanks, I'd be most happy to...
if Miss Hancock has no objections.
Why don't you ask her to dance
and find out?
Come in.
-Good morning, sir.
-Merne.
Congratulations on the Louisiana Purchase.
I hope you and Miss Julia have forgiven me.
We're happy to hear
of your success with the Congress.
Dealing with the Congress is like shaving.
No matter how well you do, you have
to get up next morning and do it again.
However, in this case,
we've made a good beginning.
I'd say it's more than that, sir.
We paid $1 5 million,
and we got a lot of real estate.
We know it stretches...
from the Mississippi River
to the Continental Divide.
That's all we do know about it.
What do you have in mind, sir?
A military expedition
to explore and map our new territory.
Find out what's there:
soil, minerals, animal life.
Land is no good unless people can use it.
-Sounds like a big order, Mr. President.
-This is now a big country.
The first step is to explore
the Missouri River to its headwaters.
The second is to press on further west.
Beyond the limits of the purchase?
To the Pacific Ocean, if possible.
-But we don't own that territory.
-Neither does anyone else.
That's the point.
Here is the Mississippi River.
Here's the Missouri.
Here are the mountains,
and here is the Pacific Ocean.
Now, we believe there are rivers
flowing westward to the sea.
If those rivers could be navigated...
we'd have a strong claim to the land
that lies along the Pacific Coast.
-Your mouth is open, Mr. Lewis.
-I'm sorry.
We are surrounded by foreign powers...
who would dearly love to see us fall.
The dream on which this nation
was built will never be secure...
until the United States stretches
from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
Do you really think it's possible, sir?
Would you please help me with this?
The leader of this party
must be a man of many talents.
A soldier, a mapmaker, an adventurer...
and above all, a diplomat.
A man like that might be hard to find, sir.
I don't think so. What about yourself?
-Me?
-Your mouth, Merne, it's open again.
Well, what do you say?
I'm tremendously flattered, sir.
I'm tremendously pleased.
Then it's settled.
I'll apply for a reinstatement
of my commission.
I took the liberty of going over your head.
You'll need one other officer.
Anyone in particular
you'd like me to request?
-Yes, sir. Lt. William Clark.
-Yes, Clark.
He's a good soldier.
He's had a lot of experience fighting Indians.
I want you to remember that, in a sense,
you'll be acting as my ambassador.
You will use diplomacy instead of force
wherever possible.
Yes, sir. I have one request, Mr. President.
I'd like Lt. Clark to share command
with me, in a position of equal rank.
If that's the way you prefer it...
you make your plans and we'll discuss them.
Yes, sir.
Now I suppose Miss Julia will really hate me.
I'm afraid she will, sir.
-Mr. Lewis.
-Good morning, Tom.
-Mr. Hancock is in the library.
-Yes.
-Welcome back. It's good to see you.
-Thank you, sir.
Is Julia around?
She went for a walk, I believe,
with Lt. Clark.
They should be back any minute now.
Come and sit down
and tell me about this expedition....
Well, you....
You told me
that garden was a romantic spot.
I guess you were right.
Merne, I'm very sorry.
Mr. Hancock, I've just asked
your daughter to marry me...
and she's accepted.
I hope you've no objections. She--
No, I won't object to anything
that will make Julia happy.
-Capt. Lewis is here.
-Wonderful.
I'm sure you'll understand...
if he doesn't seem to share your happiness.
No, I can't say that I do.
Congratulations, Bill.
Thanks.
I must tell you, Merne...
I don't think Lt. Clark
knew of your feelings in this matter.
I can see now that my feelings
were never shared by Julia.
I can't blame anyone for that.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
You got my letter?
Yes. I also got my orders
from the War Department.
Merne, I didn't realize
how you felt about Julia.
I'm sure you didn't, Bill.
I knew you were good friends.
I thought that's all there was to it.
I wanted to think there was something
more than that, but there wasn't.
Now about the expedition,
do you want to go?
Yes, of course I want to go.
Merne, you've got to tell me the truth.
We have to be honest with each other.
Do you still want me to go, now?
We leave for Wood River in the morning.
If everything goes well,
we should be there by early spring.
You, Shannon!
-Yes, Sergeant?
-Take up on them back stays.
-Capt. Lewis, sir?
-Yes.
Sgt. Gass, sir.
I'm in charge of the enlisted detail.
I'll show you to your quarters, sir.
What about the men, Sergeant?
They're a pretty good lot, sir.
Young and strong and full of the devil.
-They're all volunteers.
-Good.
I wish I'd had these boys
back in '76 against the British.
All they need is training
and a firm Irish hand.
Between us,
we'll see they get plenty of both.
-You are Lt. Clark, sir?
-This is Capt. Clark, Sergeant.
Sorry, sir. This War Department dispatch...
came addressed to Lt. Clark.
You were right the first time, Sergeant.
I thought you said
I was supposed to get a promotion.
Seven hundred men in the Army and
not one vacancy in the grade of captain.
-You said the President authorized it.
-He did.
You know the Army.
Somebody forgot to tell somebody else.
-That's no help to me.
-Don't worry about it.
As far as this expedition is concerned,
you're a captain.
Who should I believe,
you or the War Department?
-They say--
-I don't care what they say.
Mr. Jefferson said we'd share command
and it'll be that way.
-Is that clear, Sergeant?
-Yes, sir.
Capt. Clark and I will share these quarters.
-Will you send for our duffle?
-Yes, sir.
In gangplank.
Let go forward.
Fend her off.
Let go aft.
Helm hard to starboard.
Safe journey!
Goodbye.
Pull!
Put your backs in it.
Time.
Five-eight-six.
Forty degrees and 12 minutes.
Forty degrees, 12 minutes.
-Watch that line.
-Keep that line moving.
I just saw another one.
We must be getting pretty close
to their village.
Pass the word, Sergeant.
Everybody on the alert.
Expecting trouble, Captain?
They're Indians, aren't they?
When we land,
I want everyone in full uniform.
I thought maybe we could sail
right past them.
What's the matter, Sergeant?
Don't you want something
to tell your grandchildren?
Shore, march.
Company, halt.
Order firelocks.
We have come to see LeBorgne,
Chief of the Minnetarees.
I am LeBorgne.
We have come from
the Great Chief of the United States.
Our chief sends you this
as a sign of friendship.
-He wants you to know--
-
Americans cannot trade here.
This territory belongs to France.
-Who are you?
-My name is Charboneau.
I have the permit to trade here
from the Northwest Company.
The news evidently hasn't reached here.
This territory has been purchased
from France...
by the United States government.
We are here to explore it.
This is a picture of our chief.
He is your chief now, as well as ours.
These words...
they stand for peace and friendship.
It is our desire to live in that spirit
with the Minnetarees.
In return, you will get protection
from your enemies.
The Minnetarees need no protection
against their enemies.
My warriors are brave. We too have guns.
The white man has more guns
and more warriors.
If we were weak,
we would not come as friends. We....
We need one of you to guide us
to the mountains where the river begins.
That is the land of our enemies,
the Shoshones.
We'll not go there.
How about you, Charboneau?
You ought to know this country.
If you are successful,
other Americans will come.
There will be trading posts
at every bend of the river.
No. I will not help you to ruin my business.
This is a big country.
There's room enough for everybody.
I like it better the way it is.
We came as friends.
We will leave as friends.
With your permission,
we will camp here for the night.
We have brought gifts for your people.
Company, shoulder firelocks.
To the right, about face.
To the front, march.
Excuse me, sir. There's a squaw outside.
She wants to see you.
-All right, send her in.
-Yes, sir.
Yes?
My name is Sacajawea.
At the village, you said you are going
to where the river meets the mountains.
Yes, we are.
That is the land of my people.
That isn't Minnetaree country.
I am Shoshone.
I was captured by the Minnetarees.
They raid our villages, steal our horses...
and carry our women off as slaves.
Take me with you. I will show you the way.
What you ask is impossible,
even if what you say is true.
I do not lie.
I was wearing this when I was captured.
You will not see one like it here.
These are seashells.
The Shoshones live in the mountains.
My father got this
from beyond the mountains.
From the people
who live by the Great River.
-There's a river beyond the mountains?
-Yes.
The river that flows to the big salt water.
I want to return to my people.
My brother is chief of our village.
You would be made welcome.
No.
Sorry.
We'd like to help you, but we can't.
If you find your way, give this to my people.
I have stolen these seeds, one at a time.
Teach them how to plant the seeds...
so they will not go hungry
when the winter comes.
-This will be done.
-My people will thank you.
Bill, maybe we're making a mistake.
We could use somebody
that knows the country.
I've been fighting Indians long enough
to know you can't trust any of them.
I think the girl was telling the truth.
I have given much thought
to the white man.
If they are allowed to pass,
many more will follow.
Then the white men will have
too many soldiers, too many guns.
This is true.
Already they speak
of their chief as my chief.
You have something on your mind?
I will need your help.
You asked once for the Shoshone slave.
Sacajawea.
I will give her to you.
What is it you wish me to do?
Crow Woman, leave us alone.
You will go to these white men.
You will tell them
that you will lead them up the river.
''It is further agreed that
the Government of the United States...
''hereby undertakes
to guarantee the protection...
''of Chief LeBorgne and his people
from all enemies.
''By the wearing of this emblem...
''Chief LeBorgne acknowledges
his allegiance to the authority...
''and sovereignty of the United States.''
Sergeant.
Detail, to the left, face!
To the front, march!
Take her in.
-Gangplank aboard.
-Sergeant, cast off.
Cast off!
Fend off there.
Pull in those lines!
Lay down your oars! Now!
Give way together!
Pull!
Tomorrow, you ride against our enemies.
The Great Spirit will ride with you.
You will bring back many scalps!
Shoshone.
Tonight you will sleep
in the hut of Charboneau.
I don't understand.
You have been given to Charboneau
by Chief LeBorgne.
He will want you in his hut
when he returns tomorrow.
But Charboneau has gone.
He will not come back for many moons.
He will return tomorrow.
Be ready for him.
He is leading the white men
up the river to the mountains.
How can he come back tomorrow?
Perhaps the white men
will not be allowed to go so far.
We are slaves, child.
This is no concern of ours.
Halt, or I'll fire!
Sergeant!
-Take me to your chief.
-Wait here.
What are you doing here?
I came to warn you.
The Minnetarees are going to attack.
-How do you know?
-I saw them leave the village.
Then how did you get here ahead of them?
Look at my horse.
Why do you ask questions?
You must do something.
I think she's telling the truth.
We'll see if she is.
Sergeant, double your guards.
Assemble the men.
Yes, sir.
McNeil.
Fire!
Hold your fire!
Thought you said
they wouldn't give us any trouble.
They are savages, Captain.
Who knows what they will do.
Maybe you'd like to deliver these yourself.
-Hey, look over there.
-What is it?
-Fresh game.
-Hand me my gun.
Buffalo meat.
Good size herd, too.
How about pulling into shore?
There it is, Capt. Clark.
Look at the elk.
Plenty of them, too.
Better eating than buffalo.
-Anything would taste good to me.
-Sure are a lot of them.
Never seen so many.
Hey, they got one.
Give us a hand here!
Fresh meat!
All right, I got it.
You should've seen the whole herd.
Bigger than horses.
We've been carrying this carcass for miles.
Pull!
Which way?
That way.
To the left, Cruzatte.
Bear to the right.
Better pull in to shore.
Merne, you wanted her along
because she knows the country.
She's positive it's the left fork.
I know, but she could be wrong.
According to my calculations,
it's the right fork. Here.
You will find out.
On the river that comes from
the mountain there is a great falls.
How far up from here?
Two days.
But we've got to be sure, Bill.
We can't afford a mistake.
Time is so important.
Why don't we split up and look for this falls?
All right. I'll take Charboneau
and try the right fork.
The one who finds the falls waits there.
The other one turns back after two days.
All right.
Cast off forward!
All clear!
Fend off there!
You take great care
with these tools of yours.
We use them to make maps.
Pictures of the river.
Here. Like this.
Look.
But you cannot see the sun on the water...
or the blue of the sky.
I would rather look at the river.
So would I.
These pictures, they are important?
Yes. I guess they are more important
than we are.
A picture is more important than a man?
Sometimes.
You see, our job is to get these pictures
to our people.
They will come here.
They will bring their women,
and they will stay.
Maybe. Someday.
They are beautiful,
the women of your people?
Some of them.
Just like some Indian women.
You know, that's the first time
I've seen you smile.
What is it?
I would like to see a woman with red hair.
Cruzatte! The rope!
Cruzatte!
Keep her bow upstream!
I'm trying!
I can't hold her!
You should put on dry clothes.
I have to get this sextant dry first.
A little cold water never hurt anybody.
Do you like it?
It's very pretty.
It's nice and dry.
You know....
Maybe we could...
fix it up a little.
There.
That's much better.
You look a lot more like Mary Jane
than Sacajawea.
That name's going to give me
a lot of trouble.
You mind if I call you Janey?
Janey?
It sounds pretty.
What does it mean?
It means ''beautiful.''
I'll tell you one thing, Janey.
That dress is too long.
Get to work,
you lazy, worthless, prying scum!
Go on!
You men, get the supplies onboard.
Make ready to cast off.
Go on!
Steer for the bank!
What do we do now, sir?
We'll wait here for Capt. Lewis.
Then we'll push on.
What about the boat, sir?
We'll take it with us.
Up over them falls? Sir, that's impossible.
I'm surprised at you, Sergeant.
In the Army, nothing's impossible.
Well, sir, in the Navy,
they say it was impossible.
Let her fall!
Let clear!
Now!
All together! Heave ho!
Hey, Sergeant, why can't they find
a river going our way for a change?
Help me out, fellas!
Everybody get a hold!
Hang on!
Get your backs in it!
That's done it.
Hold hard now.
Sergeant!
-Capt. Lewis.
-Hello, Sergeant.
-Well, the Indian girl was right, huh?
-Yes, sir.
You men have done
a lot of work around here.
You wouldn't believe it, sir.
We've been doing things that are impossible.
Where's Capt. Clark?
-He's in the tent, sir. He's laid up.
-What happened?
Well, he just keeled over
while we was working.
It looks like the fever to me.
Fever is high.
I will take care of him.
Good.
If you're as excellent a nurse
as you are a guide...
Capt. Clark will be in good hands.
Let him sleep now, but when he
wakes up, give him two of these.
I'll come back as soon as I can.
Well, Sergeant,
let's get the boat around the falls.
You like this American.
You should know that LeBorgne,
your chief, has given you to me.
-Why did he do this?
-Why is not your business.
You are mine.
Remember that...
if you want this American to get well.
The fever is gone now.
Look...
what was that you gave me to drink?
I didn't think you would remember.
My head was in your lap.
Your hands were cool on my face...
and soft.
When a man has the fever...
he has strange dreams.
I wasn't dreaming.
Go to sleep.
I wasn't dreaming.
How is Capt. Clark?
He wants his breakfast.
Breakfast? It's almost 4:00 in the afternoon.
A man needs his sleep.
Those pills worked faster than I expected.
What pills?
I used another medicine.
It tasted like boiled gunpowder.
-How are things going up above?
-They're not good.
The men are tired, discouraged, and hungry.
We're going out to see
if we can find some fresh meat.
I'll go up there later
and see if there's anything I can do.
He's in your hands, doctor.
Janey will take good care of me.
Who?
I will take care of Chief Red Head.
Chief Red Head?
He gave me a white girl's name.
I have given him an Indian name.
I see.
This is just about
the sorriest looking camp I've ever seen.
Cruzatte, where's that fiddle of yours?
Sergeant, what would you say to a drink?
I don't mind if I do.
Boys, you haven't tasted
the likes of this in over a year.
It's called whiskey.
Well, what are you waiting for?
It's enough to make a man homesick.
That will put sand in your belly.
Come on.
All right, Cruzatte.
You've wet your whistle.
Give us a tune now.
Sgt. Gass, choose your partner.
Come on, give me some.
Come on.
Give me some.
Take your hands off. This is my woman.
-What are you talking about?
-She belong to me.
No knife!
Let him go.
Watch the knife.
That's it, Captain.
That's it. You gotta go.
Get him while he's down.
What's going on here?
He tried to steal my woman.
She's mine. She was given to me.
I do not belong to him.
Sgt. Gass...
give this man some food
and send him back down the river.
I thought you had more sense.
Janey.
What's all this?
You have fought for me and you have won.
-Well?
-I belong to you now.
Wait a minute.
I fought Charboneau
because he tried to kill me.
I belong to you, as if you had bought me.
It is the custom.
This is a free country now, Janey.
You don't belong to anybody.
You do not want me?
That's not what I mean.
You see, our customs are different.
We don't get our women
by fighting over them or buying them.
How does a white woman get a man?
She waits...
until he asks her to marry him.
I will wait.
Another thing.
You see, where I come from,
a man's only allowed one wife.
This is a good idea.
You don't understand.
-You have a wife already?
-No.
I'm not married.
Then I will wait.
It's not quite that simple, Janey.
You see, there are
other people involved. I can't--
You asked me to wait,
and I said I would wait.
Now you are trying to tell me
something else.
Janey, look.
Sit down.
You see, what I am trying
to explain to you....
You stay here tonight.
Get a good night's sleep.
We'll talk this over in the morning.
Do you mind if I sleep in here tonight?
No, I guess not.
What's wrong with your tent?
Things are getting
pretty crowded over there.
Janey seems to think
that fight with Charboneau...
makes her my squaw.
By the way,
what did you name this fork of the river?
Sacajawea.
What did you call the other one?
I called it Julia.
These are the mountains
where my people live.
Somewhere up there
is the end of the Louisiana Territory.
What do we do now, Captain?
Carry the boat or move the mountains?
We'll try to find a river that runs uphill.
Let go of the anchor!
Ready with the firelocks!
Cruzatte, hold her in the center!
Man the swivel gun!
Prepare to fire!
Stop. These are Shoshones.
Janey!
Get out of there!
This is my brother, Cameahwait.
We have much to be thankful for.
With these seeds we can grow food.
We will not go hungry when the snow falls.
The white chiefs have delivered
my sister from our enemies.
We owe them more than we can pay.
We are your friends. You owe us nothing.
As friends,
we ask your counsel and your help.
Speak of what you need.
We need horses to cross the mountains
and someone to guide us.
We will repay you with food and supplies.
The white men say they are friends.
Let them give us guns, then,
to fight the Minnetarees.
We are not here to make war
among the tribes.
It is peace we want.
These are big words.
But words cannot feed us.
They cannot destroy our enemies.
I have talked with my sister.
These white men speak the truth.
Do the thoughts of a woman
now guide our council?
I, Cameahwait, guide your council.
Now hear me.
I myself will take the white chiefs
across the mountains.
Whatever they need, they will have.
Does any man oppose this?
Your sister, Sacajawea...
she will remain here?
That is for her to say.
Before she was captured,
she was promised to me.
Much time has passed since then,
Wild Eagle.
Many things have changed.
If there is someone else who claims her...
we will settle it...
between us.
It is already settled. My sister has told me.
She belongs to the chief with the red hair.
You will sleep here.
This is yours.
You are angry with me.
What did you tell your brother?
He wanted to know everything
that has happened.
He said you belonged to me.
What did you tell him?
I told him that you fought Charboneau...
and you won.
What else?
He is a man. He understands the rest.
But you lied.
There was nothing else to understand.
I did not lie.
I did not tell the truth.
-But I did not lie.
-Why?
Why didn't you tell the truth?
I was ashamed.
Ashamed?
He would think I did not please you.
I am sorry.
I will go now.
What are those for?
To keep evil spirits from our door.
What will happen if you leave now?
It is a man's right not to want a woman.
No. I mean, what will happen to you?
-I said I would go now.
-Janey, answer me.
I will be given to Wild Eagle.
You'll sleep here tonight.
From this lake,
a river leads to the great salt water.
These white men are friends.
They come in peace.
You give my people food,
they will give you canoes.
That is agreed.
-Sergeant, bring up the pack horses.
-Yes, sir.
Bahrie.
Go downriver to the land of the Nez Perce.
Tell them they are not to harm
the white men.
Tell them Cameahwait said it.
This will not be forgotten by my people.
We are friends. That is enough.
She was supposed to leave with her brother.
Why is she still here?
She changed her mind.
She's coming with us.
Who told her she could?
I did.
-You better tell her she can't.
-Why?
You don't care anything
about this girl's feelings, do you?
Any more than you care about Julia's.
I don't think that's any concern of yours.
Anything that happens here
is a concern of mine.
Tell her to go back to her people.
Is that an order?
That's an order.
-Everything ready, Sergeant?
-Yes, sir.
We'll keep one canoe out ahead
as point at all times.
The rest of you stay together.
You want to take the point?
You're giving the orders around here.
-Sgt. Gass, take the point.
-Yes, sir.
Launch your canoes!
Easy now.
Too much power.
Shove off!
Watch the rocks there. Hold them steady.
All clear.
Janey.
Janey, darling.
That's our point canoe!
Sergeant, send four men ashore.
Make sure they have plenty of ammunition.
Yes, sir.
Thayer, Collins, Fraser.
Better get started with your burial detail.
I'm sorry, Sergeant.
You'd better take that up with Capt. Lewis.
Yes, sir.
The Sergeant here has something
he wants to say.
What is it, Sergeant?
-It's about the men, sir.
-What about them?
They've had enough.
We've been away 1 8 months.
They know we've gone beyond
the Louisiana Territory...
and they don't want to go any further.
-They're soldiers, aren't they?
-Yes, sir. They're good soldiers.
-There's something else, sir.
-What's that?
They know things ain't right
between you and Capt. Clark.
I think that's got them worried
more than anything else.
-Is that all, Sergeant?
-Yes, sir.
Then let's get on with the work.
Send out a patrol
to scout the other side of the river.
Yes, sir.
George. Ross. I want two volunteers.
Where are you going?
That patrol's been out three hours now.
They may have run into trouble.
I think it's time somebody did something.
That is my responsibility, not yours.
From now on, you'll do as you're told.
-Just a minute.
-I told you not to bring that girl along.
You paid no attention.
Now I'm telling you for the last time.
Put her in a canoe and send her back.
-Sorry, Merne.
-I'm giving you a direct order.
If she goes, I go with her.
-I won't send her back.
-That is insubordination.
Why don't you prefer charges against me?
I will. If we ever get back,
I'll have you court-martialed.
I swear, I believe you would.
I've watched you with this girl.
You've been leading her on,
the same as you did Julia.
Maybe you've forgotten about that.
But I have good reason to remember.
What are you trying to do, Merne,
get even with me?
I'm not worried about you.
I'm thinking about Julia.
We might as well get one thing straight.
I'm in love with Janey.
-That's what you said about Julia.
-I love Janey. I'm gonna marry her.
I think you're a liar.
Merne, I....
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Go on to the camp, George.
Since you're not behaving like officers,
I'll not speak like a sergeant.
I don't know what's between you two,
and I couldn't care less.
But if you have any sense of responsibility...
you'll stop acting
like a couple of schoolboys.
Them woods down there
is crawling with Indians.
If we're to get out of this alive...
you'll need every man in the outfit.
I'll follow you, but the others won't.
And I can't say that I blame them.
If you'll excuse me,
I'll get on with the burying.
Our Father, who art in heaven,
Hallowed be thy Name.
Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done...
On earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread.
And forgive us our trespasses...
As we forgive those who trespass against us.
And lead us not into temptation,
But deliver us from evil.
Amen.
I owe you men an explanation.
You volunteered to explore
the Louisiana Territory...
and you've accomplished your mission.
But I haven't yet accomplished mine.
I have orders from President Jefferson
to push on further.
If this river can be followed to the ocean...
the United States will be one nation
from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
We've traveled a long, hard way together...
and I'm not going to order you
to follow me further.
You've served with courage and devotion.
And I think your sons will read about you
in their history books.
To those of you who want to go on,
I can promise little.
I can't be sure we won't dig other graves.
All I can promise you...
is a chance to serve your country well.
I'm going with Capt. Lewis.
Anybody who wants to join us,
launch your canoes.
Well, what are you waiting for?
Ambush! Hold your canoes!
Ambush!
Watch the logs!
Board your canoes!
By right of exploration,
I claim for the United States of America...
all the land we have traveled...
from the Rocky Mountains
to the Pacific Ocean.
Sgt. Gass, dismiss your men.
Fall out!
Have you changed your mind
about taking the girl back with you?
No. Have you changed your mind
about my court-martial?
Those charges are part of the official record.
You can check them for accuracy if you like.
I'll take your word for it, Captain.
You are sure
of what we talked about last night?
If I go back to Washington,
you go back with me.
You will be glad to see your people?
I don't know, Janey.
I don't know.
I ask you to bear this in mind...
when you study the budget...
I am requesting for the year 1 807.
Come in.
-They're here, sir.
-Good. Show them in.
All right.
-Mr. President.
-Lewis, my boy, I'm glad to see you.
-Thank you.
-And this is Capt. Clark?
Lt. Clark, sir.
I hope you'll forgive
that unfortunate mistake.
I have your certificate of promotion
on my desk.
Thank you, sir.
I've also arranged a little surprise for you.
It won't repay the debt
your country owes you...
but I think it will be welcome all the same.
Please sit down, gentlemen.
-May I ask a favor, Mr. President?
-Of course.
There's someone outside
I'd like you to meet.
Someone who helped us a great deal.
Saved our lives, as a matter of fact.
By all means. Bring him in.
Thank you, sir.
Sir, may I present Sacajawea,
Shoshone Tribe.
Janey, this is our chief.
It is an honor to receive you, my dear.
I am very happy to be here.
Clark isn't exaggerating, sir.
We owe this girl a great deal.
She is responsible to a great extent
for the success of the expedition.
I hope we can show you
some measure of our gratitude.
Come in.
Come in, Julia.
How are you, Julia?
-Merne, it's good to see you.
-It's good to see you, Julia.
Julia, I want to present a visitor of ours.
-This is--
-Janey.
Thank you, my dear.
Janey was with them on the expedition.
Saved their lives, as a matter of fact.
We're very grateful to you.
Why don't you take Janey up to your room.
I haven't had a chance to talk to these two.
Of course, Mr. President.
I want to thank you very much.
You'll get your chance later,
at the reception this evening.
Shall we go upstairs?
Well, gentlemen?
Before we talk, perhaps you'd like to read...
the official record of the expedition.
Of course, we kept daily journals.
We have complete maps, charts,
and so forth.
Good. I'm most anxious to.
Then we can talk, after I've read them.
Fine, sir.
Please make yourself at home.
I have to pick out a dress for tonight.
Later, I want you to meet
my mother and father.
-You live in a house like this, too?
-No.
Compared to the White House,
we live quite simply.
Didn't I hear the President call you Janey?
Capt. Clark gave me that name.
He said Sacajawea was too long.
The President said you saved his life.
What happened?
That was a long time ago.
I have forgotten.
Capt. Clark, he will be a chief now?
Yes.
I think perhaps he will.
I hope so, for his sake.
Then he would live in a house like this.
It's possible.
Someday, perhaps in this very house.
These are all yours?
I know it seems rather silly...
but here in Washington,
we have to have a dress for every occasion.
Don't worry. Your dress is lovely.
Among my people,
there is not so much to learn.
A woman cooks for her man...
works in the fields, and has the babies.
That is all.
I think that's quite a bit, don't you?
Here, I think it is different.
A little more complicated perhaps,
but not so different.
The wife of a white man, what does she do?
That's a little hard to explain.
She does have certain social duties.
But these can be easily learned.
She runs her husband's home...
entertains his friends...
tries to make him happy and successful...
and proud of being married to her.
Most important of all...
she must love him very much.
But this is not enough.
I don't know.
You see...
I'm not married myself.
It's very beautiful.
Would you like to try it on?
You love him, too, don't you?
You like this? Please take it.
I won't be going to the reception tonight.
Julia.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
It's about Bill, isn't it?
I'm sorry.
I wish there was something I could do.
Don't be angry with him, Merne.
If anything happened between you two, I....
I'm proud of you both,
what you've done together.
I don't want anything to spoil that.
If you'll excuse me, Julia...
the President is waiting for these records.
Come in.
The President would like to see you
in his study, Captain.
Do you know if he's read
Capt. Lewis' report, sir?
I believe he has.
Capt. Lewis is already there.
They are waiting for you.
After you, sir.
Come in.
I've just finished reading Lewis' report.
I don't know how you feel about it,
but I think it's very clear and objective.
Yes, sir.
Anything you'd care to add
from your own viewpoint?
No, sir.
I can assume, then, that these are the facts.
Yes, sir.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
I have to say goodbye to someone.
I'm curious about one thing, Lewis.
You were so meticulous
about everything else.
Toward the end of your report,
there are five pages missing.
Yes, something happened
to those pages, sir.
I can't explain it.
Perhaps if you gave it some thought,
you could reconstruct them.
I have thought about it, sir.
I find that I have completely forgotten
the incident.
In any case,
I want to congratulate you both.
And I want to thank you with all my heart.
Please ask the guests to come in.
I'll be back at once.
Yes, sir.
Ladies and gentlemen,
the President would like you to come in.
I wonder where Janey is.
Mrs. Hancock, have you seen Julia?
No, she hasn't come down yet.
Frankly, I'm a little concerned.
Martha.
I think I'll go upstairs and find out.
What's the matter? Where's Janey?
-She's gone, Bill.
-Gone where?
I wrote it all down just the way she told me.
''When you hear this,
I will be on my way back to my people.
''I have talked with his chief,
and he is going to help me.
''He is a good man, and he is very wise.''
-The President had no right.
-Bill, please.
''Words do not come easy.
''I only know what is in my heart.
''I have seen your country now,
and I have met your people.
''They were very kind to me.
''But it is not my country,
and they are not my people.
''I am proud of what I am.
''I do not want to try to be something else.
''If I did, I would fail.
''I would fail you,
but I would also fail myself...
''and all my people.
''Many women grow old and die...
''and never know the happiness I have had.
''For this, I will always be grateful.
''Now there are others
who love and need you...
