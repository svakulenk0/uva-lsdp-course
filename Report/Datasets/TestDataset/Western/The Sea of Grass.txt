TELEGRAM
FOR MISS CAMERON.
NAT, WE'RE LATE,TERRIBLY LATE.
RIGHT.
TELEGRAM FOR ME?
NO, FOR MISS LUTIE.
I'LL TAKE IT UP TO HER.
MISS LUTIE UP IN HER ROOM?
THEY'RE ALL UP THERE.
WOULDN'T YOU THINK
THEY'D GET TIRED
OF LOOKING AT THEMSELVES?
WEDDINGS!
I'LL BE SO GLAD WHEN IT'S OVER.
HURRY UP, RACHAEL.
WHAT FOR?
IT AIN'T TILL 3 DAYS.
RACHAEL, HAVE YOU
EVER BEEN MARRIED?
YES'EM-HERE AND THERE
NOW AND THEN.
WHERE'S LUTIE?
SHE'S IN THERE.
SHE'S TRYING IT ON.
MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN YOU
CAN IMAGINE!
MAY I SEE YOU,
LUTIE?
ONE MINUTE, FATHER!
LET HIM IN, RACHAEL.
YOU LOOK FINE.
THEN SMILE!
- SMILE?
YOU HAVEN'T SMILED
ONCE SINCE I GOT ENGAGED.
WHY, LUTIE, I...
THE TWO LONGEST THINGS
IN ST. LOUIS-
YOUR FACE AND THE
MISSISSIPPI RIVER.
WELL, I ONLY WANT
YOUR HAPPINESS, LUTIE.
AND I JUST KEEP THINKING
ONE THING:
JIM BREWTON IS ALL RIGHT.
HE'S GREAT IN SALT FORK
TERRITORY OF NEW MEXICO
AND YOU'RE ALL RIGHT
IN ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI.
STOP IT, DARLING.
AND THEN I THINK OF
THE TWO OF YOU TOGETHER,
AND NEITHER PLACE-
I KNOW IT'S GOING
TO BE RIGHT.
AND, LUTIE, SUCH A
A SHORT COURTSHIP.
A COWMAN!
BUT SUCH A COWMAN.
REMEMBER WHAT YOU SAID
WHEN YOU INTRODUCED US.
THAT'S RIGHT,
I DID INTRODUCE YOU.
HERE'S A TELEGRAM
FOR YOU.
OH, THANKS.
IT'S PROBABLY FROM HIM.
HE MUST HAVE LEFT.
HE SAID HE'D WIRE
THE MINUTE HE GOT
ON THE TRAIN.
DELAYED. CAN'T-
GET TO ST. LOUIS FCR WEDDING.
TAKE FIRST TRAIN
BE MARRIED HERE. LOVE, JIM.
WELL!
FATHER, THIS IS NOT FUNNY.
WELL, YOU ASKED ME
TO SMILE, DIDN'T YOU?
YOU DONE IT-
TRAIN'S EARLY, 3/4 OF AN HOUR!
AND 33 SECONDS.
I GOT A STOPWATCH.
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO
IF SAM DOESN'T MEET YOU?
DON'T WORRY.
YOU HEARD THE CONDUCTOR-
TRAIN'S EARLY.
YOUR MAN AIN'T
SHOWED UP, NEITHER.
SAMMY!
SAMMY!
- SELINA!
HELLO, SPROUT.
YOU'VE GROWED!
REGULAR BUSTER,
AIN'T SHE?
SAM, THIS IS
LUTIE CAMERON.
WE KEPT EACH OTHER COMPANY
ON THE ROAD OUT.
SHE SPELLED ME WITH MOLLY.
HAPPY TO KNOW YOU, SAM.
I'VE HEARD
A LOT ABOUT YOU.
NO MORE THAN I HEARD
OF HER MAN.
MAYBE I KNOW HIM.
HOMESTEADER?
CATTLEMAN.
- OH.
NAME OF JIM BREWTON.
COLONEL BREWTON?
- MM-HMM.
YES, I KNOW HIM.
I SURE THANK YOU FOR HELPING
THE WIFE OUT, MA'AM.
COME ON, HONEY.
ALL RIGHT, SAM.
GOODBYE, LUTIE.
GOODBYE, SELINA.
GOOD LUCK TO YOU.
WE'LL SEE EACH OTHER.
BE A GOOD GIRL,
BUTTON-NOSE.
THERE'S A-A HOTEL?
SURE. EXCHANGE HOUSE
OVER THERE.
THANK YOU.
COLONE BREWTON WILL
CALL FOR THIS LUGGAGE.
YES, MA'AM.
I'M SORRY
TO DISTURB YOU
BUT WILL YOU
HELP ME, PLEASE?
OH, THANK YOU
VERY MUCH.
I'LL BE A SON OF A GUN.
I BEG YOUR PARDON?
I SAID,
I'M A SON OF A GUN.
IT ISN'T POSSIBLE. OF COURSE NOW,
IS IT? - WHAT?
THAT YOU ARE MISS LUTIE CAMERON
OF ST. LOUIS AND POINTS EAST.
SHE ARRIVES ON THE 3:00.
THEY'RE SENDING UP
ROCKETS THEN.
THE TRAIN WAS EARLY.
TRUST JIM BREWTON
TO PICK A WOMAN
WITH HAIR THE COLOR
OF CHILI PEPPER.
WELL, DON'T WORRY,
I LIKE IT.
WELL, IF YOU KNOW COLONEL
BREWTON, YOU CAN HELP ME.
EVERYBODY KNOWS JIM BREWTON,
SOME TO THEIR SORROW.
YOUR IMPENDING ARRIVAL
HAS CREATED QUITE A STIR
IN SALT FORK,
MISS CAMERON.
BREATHS HAVE BEEN
WELL-BATED.
I SHALL NOW BATE MINE AGAIN.
YOU'RE MAKING THE MISTAKE
OF YOUR LIFE, YOU KNOW.
THERE'S A TRAIN OUT
OF HERE TOMORROW.
IF I WERE YOU,
I'D BE ON IT.
WHO ARE YOU, ANYWAY?
THE NAME'S BRICE CHAMBERLAIN.
HOWEVER, "WHAT," NOT "WHO,"
IS THE IMPORTANT THING.
I, MISS CAMERON,
AM AN IDEALIST-
A PRACTICING IDEALIST.
LOOK AROUND YOU,
MISS CAMERON.
YOU'RE OUT OF PLACE.
THE WINE OF THE COW COUNTRY
IS REDEYE, NOT CHAMPAGNE.
REDEYE...
- REDEYE.
A VERY INFERIOR
BRAND OF WHISKEY.
NEVER TOUCH
THE STUFF MYSELF.
UNDERSTAND BREWTON
DOES, THOUGH.
I SHOULD BE VERY ANGRY.
I GUESS I AM.
ON THE OTHER HAND, MAYBE I'M NOT.
I DON'T KNOW.
THIS IS SUCH
A PLACE.
COME ON, MR. CHAMBERLAIN,
JURY'S COMING IN.
WE BETTER GET OVER THERE.
BREWTON AIN'T SHOWED UP YET.
SURE, ANDY. MEET YOU
AT THE COURTHOUSE.
IS THAT WHERE COLONEL BREWTON IS,
AT THE COURTHOUSE?
THAT'S WHERE I LEFT HIM.
WHY, YOU'RE HIS ENEMY,
AREN'T YOU?
HIS NATURAL ENEMY.
WE'RE MAKING HISTORY IN SALT FORK
TODAY, MISS CAMERON.
I HOPE IT WILL BE
THE RIGHT KIND.
IF BREWTON HAS HIS WAY
IT WON'T BE.
QUIET DOWN, FOLKS,
QUIET DOWN!
QUIET IN THE COURTHOUSE, BOYS.
THE COURT'S IN SESSION NOW.
GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY
HAV E YOU REACHED A DECISION?
YES, SIR, WE HAVE-
UNANIMOUS.
HOW FIND YOU?
ARE THE DEFENDANTS GUILTY
OR NOT GUILTY?
WE FIND THAT
ANDY BOGGS HERE
WAS SHOT AND RUN OFF
THE LAND HE FILED ON
BY PARTIES UNKNOWN.
WELL, THAT VERDICT
DON'T SETTLE ANYTHING.
HOW ABOUT
THE DEFENDANTS HERE-
IKE RANDALL
AND BILL ROACH?
YOU MEAN, THE BOYS
WHAT DONE THE SHOOTIN'?
THEY AIN'T GUILTY.
DEFENDANTS RELEASED.
COURT'S ADJOURNED!
JUST ONE MOMENT,
GENTLEMEN!
THIS TRIAL'S OVER, BUT AS
ATTORNEY FOR THE PLAINTIFFS,
THERE ARE STILL A FEW
THINGS STICKING IN MY CRAW.
SWALLOW QUICK,
AND MAYBE THEY'LL GO AWAY.
COLONEL BREWTON, I WONDER,
NOW THAT WE'VE LOST
IF YOU'D OBLIGE ME
BY ANSWERING A FEW QUESTIONS.
LET'S SAY, AS A SPORTING
PROPOSITION.
TROUBLE WITH YOU IS,
YOU DON'T KNOW WHEN YOU'RE LICKED.
NO, HE DOESN'T, MAC.
WE'LL HAVE TO GIVE HIM THAT.
ALL RIGHT, SIR
GO AHEAD.
JUST REMEMBER, I'VE GOT A
THANK YOU,
I'LL BE BRIEF.
COLONEL BREWTON,
HOW MUCH CATTLE RANGE DO YOU CONTROL?
I'VE HEARD IT RUNS
INTO A MILLION OR MORE ACRES.
I'VE NEVER COUNTED THEM.
THEN AGAIN, I'VE HEARD
THAT IT'S 100 SQUARE MILES.
IN ANY CASE YOU WILL ADMIT
THAT'S A LOT OF LAND FOR ONE MAN.
WELL, I RUN A LOT OF COWS.
IS IT TRUE THAT OF THIS
VAST AMOUNT OF PROPERTY
YOU ACTUALLY OWN ONLY
A FEW SCATTERED WATER HOLES
THAT ARE FILED ON
EITHER IN YOUR NAME
OR THOSE OF YOUR MEN?
AND THAT BY FAR
THE GREATER PART OF IT
STILL BELONGS
TO THE GOVERNMENT.
LEGALLY, YES.
IS IT TRUE, THEN THAT
MILLION OR MORE ACRES
STILL BELONGING
TO THE GOVERNMENT,
IS THE SAME LAND FROM
WHICH ANDREW BOGGS
WHO MERELY WANTED 160 ACRES
FOR A HOMESTEAD.
WAS RUN OFF AND
SEVERELY WOUNDED
BY PARTIES UNKNOWN.
BOGGS WAS NOT
RUN OFF BECAUSE
HE WANTED TO SETTLE
THE 160 ACRES
BUT BECAUSE OF WHAT
HE WANTED TO DO WITH THE LAND.
LET'S FORGET
ABOUT THIS CASE.
ANDREW BOGGS IS ONLY
A SINGLE MAN,
AND THE COURT HAS
ALREADY DISPOSED OF HIM.
BUT WAITING AT
THE EDGE OF SALT FORK
TO HEAR THE OUTCOME OF THIS TRIAL
ARE OTHER SETTLERS.
MEN WITH FAMILIES,
WHO'VE DRIVEN THEIR WAGONS
MORE THAN 1,000 MILES
ACROSS THE PLAINS
AND LEFT THEIR DEAD
FROM THE MISSISSIPPI
TO THE RIO GRANDE
ALL WITH ONE PURPOSE-
TO FIND HOMES
FOR THEMSELVES IN THIS GREAT TERRITORY.
I WANT TO ASK IN THE NAMES
OF THESE FAMILIES
IF YOU WON'T LET THEM SETTLE
UNDISTURBED ON A FEW ACRES
OUT OF THE MILLIONS OR MORE
OF GOVERNMENT LAND ON YOUR RANGE.
CHAMBERLAIN, I HAVE SYMPATHY
FOR THE EARLY PIONEER
WHO CAME OUT HERE
AND RISKED HIS LIFE
AND HIS FAMILY'S
AMONG THE INDIANS,
AND I HOPE I HAVE A LITTLE CHARITY
FOR THE NESTOR
WHO WAITED UNTIL THE COUNTRY
WAS SAFE AND PEACEABLE
BEFORE HE FILED HIS HOMESTEAD
ON THE RANGE
OF SOMEONE ELSE WHO
HAD FOUGHT FOR IT.
BUT WHEN THAT NESTOR PICKS
LAND LIKE MY BIG VEGA,
WHICH IS 7000 FEET ABOVE THE SEA
WHICH WAS NATURALLY
INTENDED FOR
GRAZING LAND, AND ALWAYS WILL
BE GRAZING LAND,
WHEN HE WANT TO PLOW IT UP
TO SUPPORT HIS FAMILY
WHERE THERE ISN'T ENOUGH RAIN
FOR THE CROPS TO GROW,
WHEN HE ONLY KILLS
THE GRASS THAT WILL GROW,
AND THEN, WHEN HIS CROPS
STARVE FOR WATER,
SUPPORTS HIS FAMILY
BY KILLING MY BEEF,
AND BECOMES A MAN WITHOUT
RESPECT TO HIMSELF
AND A MENACE
TO THE TERRITORY,
THEN I HAVE NEITHER SYMPATHY
NOR CHARITY.
AND IF I KNOW THE TEMPER
OF THE PEOPLE AROUND HERE
WHAT ANDY BOGGS GOT
IS JUST A SAMPLE OF
WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF OTHERS
TRY IT.
THEY TOLD ME THERE WAS
NO JUSTICE HERE
AND THAT YOU DOMINATED
THE COUNTRY.
THEY WERE RIGHT.
WELL, WE WON, JIM.
BOYS, I'VE GOT A TRAIN TO MEET.
JIM! JIM!
JIM!
PARDON, PARDON.
JIM, THE TRAIN
BROKE A RECORD.
I'LL MAKE UP FOR THAT LATER.
OH, I WANT YOU TO MEET A FRIEND
OF MINE, DOC REID.
HOW DO YOU DO?
- THIS IS JUDGE WHITE.
HOW DO YOU DO?
- HOW DO YOU DO?
FLOYD McCURTIN.
HOW DO YOU DO?
- HOW DO YOU DO?
WELL, WE WON, DIDN'T WE?
WHATEVER IT WAS.
WE HAD TO.
DID WE, JIM?
WELL, I DON'T KNOW.
WE WON TODAY,
BUT I DIDN'T LIKE
THAT BEAT LOOK
IN ANDY BOGGS' EYES.
YOU GET ENOUGH MEN LOOKING
LIKE THAT..
WELL, I DON'T LIKE
WHAT I SEE COMING.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
OH, THE DOC-
HE DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING.
YOU'LL GET TO KNOW THE DOC.
I HOPE I GET TO KNOW ALL
OF YOU.
AND THAT YOU'RE
GOING TO LIKE ME
AS WELL AS I'M GOING
TO LIKE YOU.
THERE YOU ARE, BOYS,
DO YOU SEE NOW WHY I DID IT?
SURE DO. BUT NOW WE'RE WONDERING
WHY YOU WAITED SO LONG.
COME ON.
SUCH A HURRY, JIM.
COME ON. YOU'LL BE THE FIRST WOMAN
IN THE TERRITORY
EVER MARRIED IN HER SLEEP.
WE MADE IT.
WHAT DID WE MAKE, JIM?
WHERE ARE WE?
THE GREATEST PLACE I KNOW.
COME ON.
THERE IT IS.
IT'S ALL GRASS.
YEAH.
WELL, IT'S JUST...
IT'S SO EMPTY,
SO QUIET.
QUIET?
MORE NOISE OUT THERE
THAN THERE IS IN ST. LOUIS.
I DON'T HEAR ANYTHING.
WELL, YOU HAVE TO LISTEN FOR IT
BEFORE YOU CAN.
I'M LISTENING, JIM.
ALL I HEAR IS THAT LITTLE
WHISTLE OF A SOUND.
THE WIND?
THERE'S A LOT MORE
THAN THAT OUT THERE.
TELL ME, JIM-WHAT?
WELL...
NO, PLEASE TELL ME.
I'LL TRY TO UNDERSTAND.
WHAT DO YOU HEAR
OUT THERE?
WELL, FIRST OF ALL,
I GUESS I HEAR THE BUFFALO.
BUFFALO? BUT THEY AREN'T
THERE ANYMORE.
THAT'S RIGHT.
OH. WHAT ELSE, JIM?i
INDIANS.
GONE, TOO?
HERDED INTO
A RESERVATION.
I CAN REMEMBER THE FIRST
TIME I SAW HER.
WE'D COME A LONG WAY
AND NOBODY WAS TELLING US
ABOUT ANY SURPRISES, EITHER.
WE JUST CAME OVER THE HILL
AND THERE SHE WAS
SORT OF LYING THERE ALL ALONE.
NOBODY WANTED HER THEN...
EXCEPT THE ANTELOPE AND THE BUFFALO
AND THE INDIANS.
SO WE TOOK HER, AND WE SET HER UP
RIGHT FOR COW COUNTRY.
WE FOUGHT FOR HER.
OUR BLOOD'S SUNK
IN EVERY MILE.
INDIAN BLOOD, TOO.
I'M NOT SO PROUD
OF SOME OF THAT.
MY BROTHER'S OUT THERE.
I SUPPOSE I SOUNDED HARD
TO YOU BACK AT THE TRIAL
AND TO EVERYBODY ELSE.
AND I SUPPOSE IT'S HARD
TO UNDERSTAND
THAT ALL THAT OUT THERE
IS ANYTHING BUT JUST A LOT OF GRASS
MADE TO ORDER
FOR FARMING.
YES, I SUPPOSE IT IS
JUST GRASS TO MOST.
BUT NOT TO YOU, JIM?
TO ME, IT'S LAND THE WAY GOD
MADE IT
AND WANTS IT TO STAY.
AND I MAY BE WRONG
BUT I'VE GOT A HUNCH
THAT HE WANTS ME TO HELP
HIM KEEP IT THAT WAY.
I KNOW IT'S TOO SOON TO EXPECT
YOU TO SEE IT THAT WAY, LUTIE
BUT YOU WILL
SEE IT SOME DAY.
YOU'VE GOT TO SEE IT.
I WANT TO, JIM.
WELL, THERE SHE IS.
THE RANCH.
AND A HOUSE.
HURRY, JIM.
IT'S BETTER INSIDE.
YOU BRING MY SHORTENING?
I BROUGHT YOU SOMETHING
BETTER THAN SHORTENING.
HERE IT IS.
JEFF, OUR COOK.
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING OF
RIGHT NOW, JEFF?
I'M THINKING OF
MY SHORTENING.
BANTY, COME HERE.
THIS IS BANTY OUR HORSE WRANGLER.
HOW ARE YOU, BANTY?
I'M FINE, MA'AM.
YOU'RE WELCOME, MA'AM.
THANK YOU. THAT'S A WONDERFUL
WORD, "WELCOME."
GET THOSE BAGS
WILL YOU, JEFF?
COME ON, I'LL SHOW YOU
THE LAYOUT.
FINE. CAN'T WAIT
TO SEE THE KITCHEN.
SHE'S SURE NICE
TO LOOK AT.
SHE BETTER KEEP OUT
OF MY KITCHEN.
AND YOU CAN TAKE THEM BAGS IN.
MY...
THIS WILL FIX UP NICELY.
THE STOREROOM?
NO, NO, THIS IS THE PARLOR.
THE LIVING ROOM.
WHO LIVES IN IT,
DEAR?
WELL, NOBODY, REALLY,
VERY MUCH.
YOU SEE, WE'RE NOT
HERE VERY MUCH.
I, UH... I SUPPOSE IF THIS STUFF
WAS MOVED OUT OF HERE,
IT EVENTUALLY WOULD GET
TO LOOK
LIKE A LIVING ROOM,
WOULDN'T IT?
YES, I SUPPOSE IT WOULD.
I WONDER WHY I DIDN'T
HAVE THIS STUFF
MOVED OUT BEFORE YOU CAME?
DO YOU KNOW?
NO, I REALLY DON'T.
WELL, I'LL BE DOGGONE,
NEITHER DO I.
I WANT TO SEE
THE KITCHEN.
IT'S AT THE END
OF THE HALL.
UH, TAKE IT EASY
WITH JEFF.
JUDAS.
MAY I COME IN?
JUST LOOKING AROUND,
I'LL GET RIGHT OUT.
I'D BE MUCH OBLIGED.
LORENZO, I'M WAITING ON THAT CABBAGE.
OH, BISCUITS!
WHAT DO THEY LOOK LIKE?
LOOK LIKE BISCUITS,
GOOD BISCUITS.
TASTE LIKE THAT, TOO.
NOTHING LIKE SOUR MILK AND A BIG OVEN,
IS THERE, JEFF?
BAKING SODA WENT IN FIRST-
YOU CAN TELL THAT.
SHORTENING IN JUST RIGHT TOO...
AND DOUGH ROLLED
JUST ENOUGH.
JEFF, HOW WOULD
YOU LIKE TO HAVE A DOLLAR
FOR EVERY BISCUIT
YOU'VE MADE?
I'D TAKE A NICKELOF GRASS
AND I'D OWN THE PLACE.
NOT THAT I'D WANT TO.
NOT ANYMORE. NOT NOW.
IT'S TOO CROWDED.
A MAN NEEDS ELBOW ROOM.
I WON'T EVEN COME INSIDE YOUR
KITCHEN UNTIL YOU ASK ME TO,
HONESTLY, I WON'T.
SHE ATE ONE. SHE KNEW
WHAT SHE WAS EATING.
TOUGHER THAN WHANG LEATHER.
SHE CAN LIE FASTER
THAN A DOG CAN TROT.
WAIT! WAS YOU
BRUNG UP IN A BARN?
NOW, LISTEN, I DON'T WANT
NO REACHING,
NOR EATING WITH KNIFES
NOR DRINKING OUT OF SAUCERS.
THIS HERE WOMAN'S
A LADY.
I'M SCARED.
YOU'RE SCARED?
WHAT DO YOU THINK
THE BOYS ARE? COME ON.
UP!
LUTIE, THESE ARE THE BOYS.
BOYS, THIS IS
MRS. BREWTON.
HOWDY, MA'AM.
I'M VERY GLAD TO MEET YOU.
THERE.
SIT!
THAT'S YOUR PIECE
RIGHT THERE.
MA'AM...
YES, BANTY?
MRS. BREWTON,
THE BOYS...
WE'VE BEEN
THINKING,
AND IF THERE'S ANYTHING YOU WANT
THAT WE CAN DO,
WELL, WE'D ALL-FIRED GLAD TO.
WELL, UM.. THANK YOU, BANTY.
THAT'S NICE.
ANYTHING, MA'AM.
WELL, I, UH... LET'S SEE...
OH. YOU KNOW THOSE TREES
DOWN BY THE BROOK?
BROOK?
CREEK.
- CREEK? CREEK.
I WONDER IF YOU COULD
PULL THEM OUT FOR ME.
WHY, SURE, MA'AM,
IF THEY'RE
BOTHERING YOU ANY
WE CAN THROW A ROPE
AROUND 'EM
AND YANK 'EM OUT
BY THE ROOTS.
OH, NO. NO, I MEANT
COULD YOU DIG THEM UP
AND PLANT THEM AROUND THE HOUSE
SO THAT WE COULD
HAVE SOME SHADE?
IT WOULD BE LOVELY TO FENCE IN
THE WHOLE YARD.
FENCE?
WE'LL DO IT,
MRS. BREWTON-
ALL THE ORNERY
TREES YOU WANT.
WE'LL DO IT.
WON'T WE, BOYS?
UH, SURE WILL.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
GOOD NIGHT, MRS. BREWTON.
GOOD NIGHT.
DID I DO SOMETHING WRONG?
NO, NO, NO.
YOU SAID "FENCE. THAT'S A CUSSWORD
ON THE OPEN RANGE.
OH, MY!
COLONEL, I JUST BEEN DOWN
AT THE BARN.
PETE SAYS THAT NEW BULL'S BEEN
FIGHTING AGAIN.
- OH?
CUT UP PRETTY BAD.
OH, I'LL GO
RIGHT DOWN.
YOU'LL BE ALL RIGHT,
WON'T YOU?
I CAN'T TAKE A CHANCE ON
THAT NEW BULL.
JEFF, JUST HOW
IMPORTANT IS A BULL?
WELL, THIS ONE
IS SURE A BEAUTY.
THERE'S A NEIGHBOR.
HUH? WHERE?
THERE.
OH, THAT'S JUST
HEADQUARTERS CAMP.
OH.
WE GOT A NEIGHBOR,
THOUGH.
MCGEE RANCH, LAYS RIGHT OVER
ABOUT 15 MILES.
IS THERE A MRS. MCGEE?
NO. MCGEE'S
AN OLD BACH.
OH.
WELL...
GOOD NIGHT, JEFF.
LUTIE.
YES, JIM?
HAVE YOU BEEN CRYING?
NO.
HAVE YOU BEEN FEELING LIKE CRYING?
NO, JIM.
WHAT HAVE YOU
BEEN FEELING?
OH, I'VE BEEN...
JUST THINKING.
WHAT ABOUT?
OH, ABOUT... ABOUT ALL THE THINGS
I'M GOING TO DO
HOW I'M GOING TO
FIX UP THE HOUSE.
I'LL GET YOU EVERYTHING
YOU NEED, LUTIE.
YOU'RE SURE
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT?
VERY SURE.
LUTIE...
ONLY...
- ONLY WHAT?
ONE THING:
I WISH YOU LOOKED AT ME
THE WAY YOU LOOK AT THAT OUT THERE.
CUT ALL THEM COPPERWOODS
OUT OF THE HERD FIRST
MRS. BREWTON DON'T WANT NO
MIXED BREEDS AT THIS END OF THE RANGE.
JUST YEW AND TAMARIND.
HEY, THIS HERE'S A MAVERICK,
AIN'T IT?
SURE 'TIS. BRAND HER
AND LET HER GO.
COMMENCE PLANTING THEM NOW,
CLEAR AROUND THE HOUSE.
YEAH, LIKE A FENCE!
PAT THE DIRT UP NICE
AROUND THEM ROOTS.
THEY'RE KIND OF SPINDLY.
I'M AFRAID THE FIRST
GOOD WIND
WILL KNOCK 'EM FLATTER
THAN A FLITTER.
DON'T YOU WORRY ABOUT
THEM LITTLE TREES.
THEY'RE SKINNY,
BUT THEY'RE AWFUL STUBBORN.
THANK YOU, BANTY.
I SAW SELINA HALL
IN TOWN YESTERDAY.
SHE'S STILL LIVING IN THAT LEAN-TO
BEHIND THE SALOON.
SHOULD'VE LEFT WHEN
THE OTHER SQUATTERS DID.
SHE'S TAKING IN WASHING NOW.
THE WATER'S LIKE LYE
HER HANDS WERE BLEEDING.
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH HER MAN?
THERE ARE PLENTY OF JOBS IN SALT FORK
IF A MAN WANTS TO WORK.
OH, HE'S WORKING
IN THE SALOON.
HE SMELLS EXACTLY
LIKE BEER.
JIM, SAM HALL'S A FARMER.
HE'S NOT A MAN TO BE
SMELLING OF BEER.
AND SELINA HAS TO CARRY ALL
THE WATER SHE USES FOR BLOCKS.
WELL, YOU CAN'T EXPECT TO FIND
MUCH WATER AROUND A SALOON.
OH, JIM.
SHE'S HAVING ANOTHER ONE,
YOU KNOW.
HUSBAND?
BABY.
OH.
SHE CAN'T HAVE IT IN THAT LEAN-TO
BEHIND THE SALOON.
SELINA SAYS THEY'VE BEEN TALKING
ABOUT FILING
ON A SPOT NEAR
MULE CREEK FLAT.
RIGHT SMACK IN THE MIDDLE
OF MY HEADQUARTERS RANGE.
YES. NICE AND CLOSE
TO US, ISN'T?
WHAT IS NICE ABOUT
BEING CLOSE?
JIM, SELINA'S MY FRIEND.
SHE'S THE ONLY ONE
I'VE GOT OUT HERE.
SHE'D BE A NEIGHBOR.
YOUR WORK TAKES YOU AWAY
SO MUCH.
I'M NOT COMPLAINING, DARLING.
BUT SHE'D BE SOMEONE
TO TALK TO.
WOMEN LIKE
TO TALK A LOT.
YES, I KNOW.
NO, THANKS.
THEY COULD BE SETTLED
BEFORE THE BABY COMES.
THAT'LL BE IN APRIL.
I'LL HAVE MINE IN MAY.
YOU'LL WHAT?
HAVE YOU SEEN DOC REID?
MM-HMM.
LUTIE!
GOOD GIRL, LUTIE
GOOD BOY, JIM.
SELINA SAYS SHE WANTS A BOY.
I'LL BUY YOU A WHOLE FLOOR OF THE BEST
HOSPITAL IN DENVER.
WHAT FOR? HOME'S THE PLACE
TO HAVE A BABY.
WONDER WHERE SELINA
WILL HAVE HERS.
OUT UNDER A BUSH SOMEWHERE,
I SUPPOSE.
I HAVE A HUNCH IT'S GOING
TO BE SOMEWHERE ON MULE CREEK FLAT.
OH, JIM! YOU'LL LIKE THE HALLS
WHEN YOU GET TO KNOW THEM.
I DON'T EXPECT TO GET TO
KNOW THEM.
WHY?
I DON'T THINK THEY'LL
BE HERE LONG ENOUGH.
DON'T BE CRUEL, JIM.
I WON'T HAVE TO. THE COUNTRY HERE
TAKES CARE OF ITSELF, LUTIE.
I DON'T KNOW JUST HOW
IT WILL HAPPEN,
BUT I'LL GIVE THEM
ABOUT 6 MONTHS.
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO
FIND OUT ALL THAT
FOR YOURSELF,
AREN'T YOU?
ALL RIGHT, GO AHEAD.
TELL THEM TO FILE,
AND AS LONG AS THEY'RE HERE,
I'LL BE NICE TO THEM.
I LOVE YOU VERY MUCH,
COLONEL BREWTON.
KIND OF TOOK ADVANTAGE
OF ME
YOU KNOW THAT, DON'T YOU,
MRS. BREWTON?
THAT'S WHAT AN ADVANTAGE IS FOR.
THIS KiD BETTER LOOK LIKE YOU,
OR I'LL DROWN IT.
HI!
HELLO, SELINA! WHOA.
WE'RE GETTING A SOD HOUSE UP.
WHAT A COUNTRY-
MAN NEEDS A HOUSE,
HE JUST DIGS IT
OUT OF THE GROUND.
YES, QUITE A COUNTRY
AND GETTING BETTER.
WHY, MR. CHAMBERLAIN.
MRS. BREWTON.
SAY, I DIDN'T KNOW YOU FOLKS
WAS ACQUAINTED.
OH, YES. MR. CHAMBERLAIN
IS AN OLD, OLD FRIEND AND ADVISOR.
DID HE ADVISE YOU TOO, SELINA?
SHOWED US HOW TO
FILE ON THIS LAND,
IF YOU CALL THAT ADVISING.
I BROUGHT A PRESENT FOR LITTLE MOLLY.
HIS NAME IS
REDEYE SON-OF-A-GUN.
HERE, MOLLY. HERE'S
A PRESENT FOR YOU.
I HOPE YOU CAN USE ALL THAT
STUFF, SELINA.
WHY, HONEY, I CAN USE ANYTHING
FROM A BUTTONHOOK TO
A KITCHEN RANGE.
COLONEL BREWTON SENT US OVER
A SIDE OF BEEF.
THIS BUFFALO GRASS SURE
GOES DOWN DEEP.
HELLO, SAM!s
I'D FEEL A LOT EASIER IF YOU'D TAKE
THAT BEEF BACK, MRS. BREWTON.
WE DON'T NEED IT.
SHUT UP SAM,
SURE WE NEED IT.
WELL, MAYBE WE DO-
FOR EATING PURPOSES.
BUT I'D SURE CHOKE ON IT
IF I FIGURED TAKING IT
GAVE ANYBODY
ANY WRONG IDEAS.
WE'RE HERE BECAUSE WE
GOT A RIGHT TO BE HERE.
NOBODY'S LETTING US
DO ANYTHING.
WE'RE JUST DOING IT AND
WE CAN TAKE CARE OF OURSELVES.
I KNOW THAT, SAM.
YOU WANT LUTIE TO FEEL
SHE AIN'T WELCOME?
THAT AIN'T WHAT I MEAN,
AND YOU KNOW IT.
YOU WANT TO COME TO SEE MY WIFE
HERE ON OUR PLACE,
YOU COME, AND MOST WELCOME,
MRS. BREWTON.
THANK YOU, SAM.
DON'T TAKE SAM
SERIOUS.
HE'S JUST BEING A MAN.
I KNOW. THEY'RE RATHER PECULIAR PEOPLE
SOMETIMES, AREN'T THEY?
SOMETIMES?!
YOU KNOW, I OWE YOU
AN APOLOGY.
WHEN YOU FIRST DROVE UP TODAY,
I THOUGHT
"HERE COMES
LADY BOUNTIFUL."
I TAKE IT BACK. YOU'RE REALLY
FOND OF SAM AND SELINA HALL.
SELINA WAS MY FIRST FRIEND OUT HERE.
I'M AWFULLY GLAD SHE DOESN'T
SEEM LONELY.
DID YOU EXPECT HER TO BE?
WELL, THIS IS THE PLACE FOR IT.
HARDLY A WOMAN'COUNTRY.
IT COULD BE.
IT SHOULD BE,
AND SOMEDAY IT WILL.
WHEN? HOW?
WHY NOT? IT'S HAPPENED
IN OTHER PLACES.
FIRST THE COVERED WAGONS,
THEN THE HOUSES,
THEN THE FARMS-FAMILIES,
CHILDREN GROWING UP.
SURE, IT WILL BE A WOMAN'S COUNTRY THEN.
WOMEN WILL HELP
MAKE IT THEIRS.
DO YOU HEAR THAT,
MR. CHAMBERLAIN?
THE HEAR IT?
THE PEOPLE, I MEAN,
OUT THERE.
THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF
SELINAS AND SAMS
REALLY, ISN'T IT?
COLONEL BREWTON HEARS SOMETHING
SO DIFFERENT.
I'M AFRAID YOU'VE GOT ME WRONG.
I DON'T HEAR ANY VOICES.
I ONLY KNOW THIS IS GOOD LAND
THAT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING
UNLESS PEOPLE GET
THEIR LIVING OUT IT.
USE IT, LIVE ON IT.
THAT'S WHERE I COME IN.
I'M GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT HAPPENS.
ANYWAY, I'LL MAKE
A STAB AT IT.
I TURN BACK HERE.
MAYBE THEN, THIS WOULD BE
MY COUNTRY TOO.
AND YOU-
WHAT DO YOU HEAR?
I'VE BEEN TOLD
THAT A GOOD WIFE
HEARS ONLY WHAT HER HUSBAND
WANTS HER TO HEAR.
WELL, WHAT AN OLD-FASHIONED IDEA.
DON'T BE UNFAIR,
MR. CHAMBERLAIN.
YOU MUST ADMIT THAT
COLONEL BREWTON'S
MADE IT EASY
FOR SELINA AND SAM.
ONE SIDE OF BEEF?
CONSCIENCE MONEY.
YOU ARE UNFAIR.
I'M REALISTIC. DON'T FORGET
IT'S ONLY ONE SAM, ONE SELINA
AND ONE SIDE OF BEEF.
YOU SPEAK OF THOUSANDS.
I'M WONDERING WHY
BREWTON EVEN HELPED ONE.
HE'S A PIRATE, YOU KNOW.
YOU DON'T KNOW HIM,
THAT'S ALL. I DO.
WHY DO WOMEN INSIST ON LOVING MEN
FOR WHAT THEY WANT THEM TO BE
INSTEAD OF WHAT THEY ARE?
GOOD DAY, MR. CHAMBERLAIN.
YOU KNOW, I ENVY BREWTON
VERY MUCH.
YOU MEAN, YOU ENVY
THE PIRATE HIS LOOT?
NOT ALL OF IT.
JUST ONE THING.
I'LL GET AROUND TO TELLING YOU
WHAT IT IS SOME DAY.
COME NOW, MR. CHAMBERLAIN,
I'M NOT A CHILD.
I DISLIKE THIS
SCURRYING ABOUT.
IF YOU THINK I'M ATTRACTIVE, WHY DON'T
YOU SAY SO AND GET IT OVER WITH.
THAT ISN'T WHAT I MEANT,
BUT NOW THAT YOU MENTION IT
YOU ARE ATTRACTIVE.
YOU'RE VERYATTRACTIVE.
I KNOW IT, AND YOU KNOW
I KNOW IT.
YOU'VE KNOWN IT
SINCE THE FIRST TIME I LOOKED AT YOU.
YES, I-I HAVE MR. CHAMBERLAIN.
AND NOW YOU'VE SAID IT
AND WE'RE DONE WITH IT.
ARE WE?
I DON'T THINK SO.
THE COMPANY'S ALL HERE.
AIN'T THAT BABY ASLEEP YET?
NOW, YOU GO ON AND GET OUT OF HERE
YOU'RE KEEPING HER ALL RILED UP.
AND KEEP HER
OUT OF MY WAY TOO
IF YOU WANT ME TO GET
THIS CHILD TO SLEEP.
EVERYTHING READY
DOWNSTAIRS, JEFF?
WELL, OF COURSE IT IS,
ELSE WHY I'VE BEEN OVER THAT STOVE
SINCE DAYLIGHT?
NOW, GO ON, GIT!
GOOD NIGHT, SARAH BETH.
YOU TOO. NOW GO ON.
GET OUT OF HERE. VAMOOSE!
SURE IS LIGHT-FOOTED, AIN'T HE?
LIGHT-FINGERED, TOO,
IT BEGINS TO LOOK LIKE.
GENTLEMEN, I GIVE YOU
THE LADY FROM ST. LOUIS.
A GOOD TOAST TO REMEMBER
IN THIS HOUSE.
DRINK HEARTY, GENTLEMEN.
I KNOW YOU OF OLD
YOU ROBBED MY POOR FATHER
OF SILVER AND GOLD.
OH, WHISKEY, RYE WHISKEY...
WHAT ARE YOU SINGING?
IT'S A LULLABY, AND IT WON'T DO
MUCH LULLING
IF YOU PEOPLE KEEP COMING IN HERE
AND STOMPING AROUND.
HOW DO I LOOK, JEFF?
REAL PRETTY.
GO TO SLEEP, BABY...
JEFF, DO YOU EVER GET TIRED
OF COOKING FOR ALL
THESE PARTIES?
I WOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT THAT IF
I WAS YOU, COLONEL.
WOMEN GOT A CERTAIN NUMBER OF
PARTIES IN THEIR SYSTEM,
AND THEY JUST GOT
TO GET 'EM OUT.
GO TO SLEEP BABY...
GO TO SLEEP NOW.
JEFF, YOU'RE A WONDERFUL MOTHER.
YOU KNOW, BEING STIRRED UP
MUST BE GOOD FOR YOU, LUTIE.
BEEN MARRIED A WHOLE YEAR
AND STILL DON'T LOOK LIKE A WIFE.
STOP IT, BRICE.
WHAT KEEPS YOU
SO STIRRED UP, LUTIE?
YOU'VE GOT EVERYTHING
YOU WANT, HAVEN'T YOU?
STOP IT.
STOP IT, BRICE.
YOU CAN STOP ME EASY.
JUST TELL ME YOU'VE GOT
EVERYTHING YOU WANT.
TELL ME YOU'VE GOT EVEN PART
OF WHAT YOU WANT.
OH, COME ON, LUTIE,
WHY DON'T YOU ANSWER ME?
I'LL TELL YOU WHY- BECAUSE YOU
DON'T LIE VERY WELL.
THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN SAY
THAT YOU'RE NOT AFRAID TO SAY.
JUST WHITE SAND,
JUST AS SOFT AS-
HELLO, NICK.
DANCE WITH ME, JIM.
WHAT'S THE MATTER, LUTIE?
NOTHING. THIS IS YOUR DANCE,
THAT'S ALL.
PLEASE.
MADE YOU SOME TEA.
THANK YOU, JEFF.
MAYBE IT WILL WARM ME
UP A LITTLE.
A REAL HEAVY SNOWFALL.
SNOWFALL? IT'S A BLIZZARD.
I'M WORRIED ABOUT
THE COLONEL, JEFF.
HE HASN'T BEEN HOME FOR 48 HOURS.
OH, I WOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT HIM.
HE'S ALL RIGHT.
HE'S ALWAYS ALL RIGHT.
I'M WORRIED ABOUT THE CATTLE.
HEY, KEEP THEM AWAY FROM
THAT BARBED WIRE!
HEAD 'EM OFF!
FENCE! KEEP 'EM OUT
OF THE HALLS'
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO, SAM?
I TOLD BREWTON'S MEN THE NEXT STEER
THAT BUSTED DOWN MY FENCE
WAS GONNA GET BLOWN
TO PIECES.
BUT, SAM, THEM CATTLE
DON'T KNOW WHERE
THEY'RE DRIFTING IN THIS STORM.
MAYBE THEY'LL HEAD
THE OTHER WAY.
DON'T GO OUT THERE, SAM.
IT'S ONLY LOOKING FOR TROUBLE.
TROUBLE? IT WAS
TROUBLE LAST SUMMER
WHEN THEM CATTLE
TROMPLED OUR RYE CROP
BEFORE WE COULD HARVEST IT,
WASN'T IT?
I GOT FALL WHEAT PLANTED
OUT THERE
AND I AIN'T GONNA STAND BY
AND SEE IT GET RUINED!
SELINA, WITH THE NEW BABY COMING
IF WE DON'T MAKE THIS CROP
WE GOT TO GIVE UP.
NO, SAM! DON'T!
SAM, STAY HERE!
SAM! COME BACK! SAM!
KEEP THEM CATTLE
OUT OF MY WHEAT!
GET 'EM OUT OF THERE!
SAM, LOOK OUT!
COME ON, LET'S GET HIM!
KILL THAT YELLOWBELLY!
SAM!
SAM. SAM...
SAM.
SAM. SAM!
I'LL BE ALL RIGHT,
SELINA.
JEFF, JEFF!
IS JIM BACK?
NO, MRS. BREWTON,
THE COLONEL AIN'T HOME YET.
WELL, THEN WHAT'S HAPPENED, JEFF?
SOME OF THE BOYS
JUST GOT IN.
I HEATED UP SOME COFFEE.
NOW, YOU GET BACK TO BED. IT'S COLD.
NO, I'M NOT GOING BACK TO BED
UNTIL YOU TELL ME WHAT'S HAPPENED.
IT WAS NOTHING MUCH.
A LITTLE BLOWUP OVER AT HALLS.
HALL SHOT ONE OF OUR STEERS,
AND THE BOYS KIND OF WORKED HIM
OVER. NOW GIT.
WORKED HIM OVER BAD?
WELL, THE BOYS SAID "GOOD."
I'M GOING OVER TO THE HALLS.
YOU AIN'T GOING NOWHERE.
THERE'S DRIFTS.
YOU GET ME A HORSE.
SELINA'S EXPECTING ANOTHER BABY
I'M GOING TO SEE
IF SHE'S ALL RIGHT.
WELL, WRAP UP WARM.
SAM! I'VE COME
TO SEE SELINA.
IS SHE ALL RIGHT?
LET ME IN, SAM.
NO.
WHAT'S HAPPENED?
SHE TRIED TO HELP ME.
THE BABY'S DEAD.
NO, SAM...
MAKE HER GO AWAY, SAM.
I DON'T EVER WANT TO SEE HER AGAIN.
SEND HER AWAY!
SELINA-
YOU HEARD WHAT SHE SAID.
NOW, GO ON BACK TO BREWTON.
TELL HIM HE'S WON.
TELL HIM HES WON A BIG VICTORY.
WE LEAVE NOW.
NOW GO ON. GET OUT.
WHOA.
GOOD. LOOK AFTER HIM
SURE, COLONEL.
LUTIE, I HEARD
ABOUT THE HALLS.
YES.
IT WAS A BAD NIGHT
ALL AROUND.
I LOST A COUPLE
OF HUNDRED HEAD.
SORRY, JIM.
WELL, IT'S NICE TO HOME
AGAIN WITH YOU.
JIM, SELINA'S BABY
IS DEAD.
I KNOW. TOO BAD.
JIM...
JIM, SHE'S SO BITTER
AND SO LOST.
WE'VE GOT TO LET HER
KNOW HOW SORRY WE ARE.
WE'VE GOT TO HELP THEM.
THE BEST WAY TO HELP THEM
IS TO STAY AWAY FROM THEM.
JIM, THEY SAY THEY'RE LEAVING.
LET THEM GO.
I MADE A MISTAKE BEFORE, LUTIE.
I SHOULDN'T HAVE GIVEN IN TO YOU.
I WON'T AGAIN.
THE TIME I DID THOSE PEOPLE HARM
WAS WHEN LET THEM FILE.
MY FAULT, LUTIE
NOT YOURS.
JIM, IF YOU WON'T
HELP THE HALLS
FOR THEMSELVES,
THEN DO IT FOR ME.
I LOVE SELINA, AND RIGHT
NOW, SHE HATES ME.
THERE'S NOTHING
I CAN DO, LUTIE.
THIS WOULD ONLY HAPPEN AGAIN,
OR SOMETHING SIMILAR.
IT FIGURED TO HAPPEN.
THIS TOUGH COUNTRY, LUTIE.
THIS COUNTRY, I'M SICK TO DEATH
OF TALKING ABOUT THIS COUNTRY.
YOU REALLY
THINK IT'S MORE IMPORTANT
THAN THE PEOPLE IN IT.
WELL, THAT DEPENDS,
IT DEPENDS ON
WHO THE PEOPLE ARE
AND WHAT THEY'RE UP TO.
YOU LET SELINA AND SAM HALL STAY HERE
BECAUSE YOU WANTED SOMETHING
LIKE THIS TO HAPPEN-
TO SHOW ME,
TO SHOW EVERYONE
YOU DON'T CARE
HOW MANY PEOPLE DIE.
JUST SO LONG AS YOU KEEP THE GRASS
FOR YOURSELF.
LUTIE...
LUTIE... I'LL TRY TO TELL YOU, LUTIE.
IT'S HARD TO SAY
BUT...
THE HALLS DON'T COUNT
FOR MUCH, LUTIE.
NEITHER DO WE.
BUT THAT OUT THERE
DOES...
AND MEN LIKE CHAMBERLAIN,
THEY WANT TO FARM IT.
THEY WANT TO DIG IT UP
AND DRAW THE WATER OUT OF ITS VEINS,
LET THE SUN GET AT IT,
WAY DOWN DEEP.
IT WOULD CURL UP
AND DIE THEN, LUTIE,
IT WOULD BE DEAD,
AND SO WOULD THE WHOLE COUNTRY,
IT WOULD NEVER LIVE AGAIN.
I TRIED TO TELL YOU, LUTIE,
BUT YOU DIDN'T HEAR IT, DID YOU?
WE WON'T ABOUT IT ANYMORE.
THAT'S RIGHT NO TALK, JUST YOU
AND THE GRASS THE OUT THERE.
THAT'S REALLY THE WAY
YOU WANT IT, ISN'T IT?
NO, LUTIE. I WANT
YOU WITH IT, TOO.
YOU DON'T NEED ME,
YOU NEVER DID.
LUTIE...
YOU'VE NEVER LIVED WITH ME.
I'VE BEEN HERE.
YOU'VE BEEN OUT THERE.
JIM, I'D LIKE TO GO AWAY.
I'VE GOT TO.
IT MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA.
YOU COULD DO A LITTLE
SHOPPING IN DENVER.
SOME THINKING TOO.
DENVER PAPER!
ROCKY MOUNTAIN NEWS!
NEWS?
DENVER PAPER?
CALL FOR MR. O'CONNOR!
CALL FOR
MR. O'CONNOR!
WELL, SIR, I FIGURE IF WE'RE EVER GOING
TO BREAK THE HOLD
OF THE CATTLEMEN,
WE'LL HAVE TO MAKE SALT FORK
A FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT.
AND SEE TO IT THAT AN IMPARTIAL JUDGE
IS APPOINTED. - RIGHT.
HOPE YOU ENJOY YOUR STAY
AT THE BROWN PALACE, MRS. BREWTON.
THE MARSHALL ALWAYS WINDS UP
ON THE RIGHT SIDE.
EXCUSE ME, GENTLEMEN, ONE MOMENT.
LUTIE! IN DENVEROF ALL PLACES!
BUT NOT FOR LONG.
LONG ENOUGH TO TAKE
PITY ON ME AT DINNER TONIGHT.
I'M AFRAID NOT BRICE,
MY TRAIN GOES IN THE MORNING, VERY EARLY.
THERE'S NO TRAIN LEAVING
FOR SALT FORK IN THE MORNING.
THIS TRAIN GOES TO ST. LOUIS.
OH, I'M SORRY, LUTIE.
I UNDERSTAND, OF COURSE
YOU DON'T WANT TO
SEE A LOT OF PEOPLE.
LUTIE...
I HAVE A SLEIGH
WITH A DRIVER.
CONSIDER IT YOURS
IF YOU'D LIKE SOME AIR.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, BRICE.
THAT'S VERY SWEET OF YOU.
WITHOUT ME, OF COURSE.
CALL FOR ME AT 8:00.
BREWTON'S A BIG MAN,
I'VE NEVER DENIED IT.
BUT, WELL, IT JUST DOESN'T LEAVE
ROOM FOR ANYONE ELSE-
FOR YOU, IN THIS CASE.
I USED TO WONDER HOW LONG
IT WOULD TAKE YOU TO
ADMIT THAT TO YOURSELF.
YOU NEVER REALLY EXPECTED
HIM TO CHANGE, DID YOU?
WHAT I'M SAYING IS,
IT WAS REALLY YOUR FAULT.
YOU KNEW IT WAS HOPELESS.
YOU KNEW IT THE FIRST
TIME I SAW YOU.
YOU KNEW IT
IN THE COURTROOM.
IT'S BEEN WRITTEN ALL OVER YOUR FACE
EVERY TIME SINCE THEN.
THE HALLS WERE YOUR FAULT, TOO.
YOU INSISTED ON PLUNKING THEM DOWN
RIGHT IN THE LION'S DEN.
AND SAT AROUND HOPING
NOTHING WOULD HAPPEN.
WELL, IT HAPPENED.
IT WAS BOUND TO HAPPEN
BREWTON BEING BREWTON.
OH, LUTIE, I'M SORRY,
I'M TERRIBLY SORRY.
I JUST WANT TO CRY,
THAT'S ALL.
I DIDN'T MEAN TO HURT YOU.
IT'S ALL RIGHT. IT'S FINE,
ONLY, ONLY...
I FEEL THAT IT'S THE FIRST TIME
THAT ANYONE
HAS SPOKEN TO ME
IN MONTHS IN MONTHS
IN MONTHS
I MEAN, ABOUT ME.
ANYWAY, WHAT YOU SAY
IS TRUE.
AND I DON'T MIND
LOOKING AT IT AT LAST.
IT DOESN'T LEAVE ME MUCH,
BUT I DON'T MIND
LOOKING AT IT.
IT LEAVES YOU ME,
LUTIE.
COME IN.
COME IN, BRICE.
THE ST. LOUIS TRAIN
LEAVES IN HALF AN HOUR.
I KNOW.
I HAVE A LITTLE MORE
PACKING TO DO.
WHEN PEOPLE PACK,
THEY'RE GOING SOMEWHERE.
WHEN THEY'RE GOING SOMEWHERE,
IT'S BETTER TO KNOW WHERE.
WELL, WHAT DO YOU MEAN, BRICE?
I MEAN, WHAT'S IT
GOING TO BE, LUTIE?
I'LL GIVE YOU TIME.
I'LL WAIT FOR YOU.
I'LL STAND BACK UNTIL YOU SEND
FOR ME
OR I'LL TAKE THAT TRAIN
TO ST. LOUIS WITH YOU.
IT WILL BE WHAT YOU WANT,
LUTIE, WHATEVER IT IS.
IT WILL BE YOUR WAY,
ALL THE WAY.
BRICE...
I'M SO ASHAMED...
AND SO SORRY.
ASHAMED FOR ME,
SORRY FOR YOU.
AND JIM.
BREWTON'S ALL RIGHT.
HE'S GOT YOU NOW
AS HE NEVER HAD YOU BEFORE.
NO, BRICE.
YOU'RE HANGING ON TO YOURSELF
RIGHT NOW
TO KEEP FROM RUNNING BACK TO HIM.
NO, BRICE.
AND YOU'RE GOING.
- NO.
YES, YOU ARE. NOTHING ON EARTH
CAN STOP YOU.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT.
I KNOW HE WON'T CHANGE.
I KNOW I'LL GO HATING
WHAT HE DOES.
AND IT WILL
ALWAYS HURT ME.
BUT NO MATTER WHAT HE DOES
OR WHAT I THINK...
NO MATTER WHERE I GO...
I'LL KEEP FEELING THAT MOST OF ME
IS THERE WITH HIM.
IT MEANS THAT YOU LOVE HIM.
YES.
AND IF I DO,
THEN I'VE GOT
TO BELIEVE IN HIM...
AND GO ALONG WITH HIM.
I'LL GO BACK. TELL HIM
WHAT I'VE DONE...
IF I HAVE THE COURAGE.
I'M SORRY FOR YOU, LUTIE.
I GOT A BIG FIRE IN THE LIVING ROOM,
MRS. BREWTON.
THANK YOU, JEFF.
HAS SARAH BETH BEEN ALL RIGHT?
SHE'S FINER THAN THAN FUZZ.
I GOT A REAL NICE FIRE
DOWNSTAIRS.
ALL RIGHT, JEFF.
COLONEL TRADED JOE NETHERWOOD
OUT OF IT.
IT'S THE ONLY PIANO IN
THE TERRITORY.
GAVE HIM HIS BEST WHITEFACE BULL.
GOOD FIRE, AIN'T IT?
YES, JEFF.
THANK YOU, JIM.
JUST A FOOL IDEA I HAD.
KIND OF LIKE
HAVING YOU AROUND.
PLAY ME A TUNE, LUTIE.
SAD MUSIC
OR HAPPY MUSIC?
UP TO YOU. YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF TUNE
YOU'VE GOT IN YOUR HEAD.
LIKE IT?
PRETTY. KIND OF
A SURPRISE, THOUGH.
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE SAD.
IT WAS SAD WHEN
YOU WENT AWAY.
COME HERE, JIM.
STAND BEHIND ME.
JIM, WHEN I WENT AWAY,
I DIDN'T INTEND TO COME BACK
EXCEPT TO GET SARAH BETH.
I WAS GOING TO ST. LOUIS.
I FELT IT WAS STILL MY TOWN,
THAT I WOULD BE RIGHT THERE.
YEAH. TREES
IN ST. LOUIS.
YES, TREES YOU DON'T HAVE TO PLANT
AND CHERISH AND PROTECT.
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU EVER NOTICED.
WHY DID YOU PLANT
THEM, LUTIE?
WERE THEY TO SHUT SOMETHING OUT
OR TO SHUT YOURSELF IN?
JIM, I WAS JEALOUS-
PLAIN MEAN JEALOUS
OF THIS COUNTRY AND THE GRASS,
AND I TRIED TO FIGHT IT.
YES, WITH THE TREES AND
WITH SELINA AND SAM
AND WITH A LOT
THINGS.
I WON'T FIGHT IT
ANYMORE, JIM.
I'LL KNOW THAT IT'S THERE,
AND I WON'T CRY ABOUT IT.
AND I WON'T
SAY BITTER THINGS,
AND I WON'T RUN AWAY.
I... I'M BACK, JIM,
IF YOU'LL HAVE ME.
I'LL HAVE YOU, LUTIE.
JIM, DON'T YOU WANT TO ASK ME
HOW DENVER WAS?
AH. DENVER'S ALWAYS
DENVER.
BUT, JIM...
I'LL MAKE IT
UP TO YOU, JIM.
WHAT IS THERE TO MAKE UP?
YOU'RE HERE.
THERE'S REALLY NO REASON
TO WORRY, LUTIE.
JUST DO THE WAY YOU DID
WITH SARAH BETH.
I'LL GO TELL
JIM YOU'RE FINE.
YES, DOC, I'M FINE.
WHEN DO YOU KNOW
WHEN IT'S TUNED?
I JUST KNOW.
DOC, WHAT'S HOLDING UP
SCIENCE?
WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO BE
ABLE TO TELL A MAN
WHETHER IT'S A BOY OR A GIRL?
WHAT DO YOU WANT, JIM?
WELL, WE GOT A GIRL.
COME ON! CHEER UP, DOC.
JIM, YOU'VE GOT TO REALIZE
LUTIE'S OUT OF HER HEAD,
BOUND TO SAY THINGS
WE CAN'T UNDERSTAND.
JUST-JUST DON'T
THINK ABOUT IT.
GO ON DOWNSTAIRS AND LET
JEFF GET YOU A CUP OF COFFEE.
OH, JEFF POUR HIM A CUP
OF COFFEE.
I GOT A POT
ON THE STOVE.
AND ME, TOO.
YOU'D BETTER
COME IN, DOCTOR.
SHE'S QUIT THAT WILD
TALK AND
I THINK THE BABY
IS GETTING CLOSE.
I NEVER HEARD
SUCH CARRYINGS-ON.
DID YOU HEAR
WHAT SHE SAID-
MRS. RYAN, NONE OF US HEARD ANYTHING
IN THAT ROOM WORTH REPEATING.
OF COURSE NOT.
CERTAINLY NOT.
I HOPE YOU REMEMEBER
THAT, MRS. RYAN.
WELL, LUTIE,
WE'VE GOT A SON.
MACK, WANT TO HAVE A SMOKE?
THANKS, JIM. ONLY GET THESE
WHEN I COME HERE.
DOC?
NO THANKS, JIM.
MRS. McCURTIN WAS SAYING
ONLY YESTERDAY, LUTIE,
BEFORE BROCK WAS BORN
WE USED TO SEE A LOT OF YOU IN TOWN.
THE PAST YEAR OR SO,
YOU'VE BEEN HOLING UP ON US.
SHE SPENDS TOO MUCH TIME
WITH THEM CHILDREN,
SHE'S BOUND TO SPOIL THEM.
SURE BOTH BABIES GOT OVER
THE CROUP RIGHT?
THEY GOT OVER IT ALL RIGHT,
NOT ON ACCOUNT OF THAT
MEDICINE YOU GAVE THEM.
YOU GOING TO TAKE THIS OR
AREN'T YOU?
THAT SO, JEFF?
WHAT CURED THEM?
BAKING SODA,
AND LOTS OF IT.
CURE ANY KIND OF A COLD.
DOCTORS!
WE GAVE THEM YOUR MEDICINE
BEHIND JEFF'S BACK.
DON'T EVER LET HIM
KNOW ABOUT IT, THOUGH.
WELL, COME ON, MACK,
LET'S HAVE IT.
WHAT?
THE BAD NEWS.
HOW'D YOU KNOW?
ALL OVER YOU
EVER SINCE YOU GOT HERE.
I'VE GOT A HUNCH CHAMBERLAIN'S
UP TO SOMETHING.
HOW'D YOU KNOW THAT?
ALL OVER HIM THE LAST TIME
I SAW HIM.
AND YOU'RE RIGHT, JIM.
HE'S UP TO PLENTY.
I'LL LEAVE YOU TO YOUR BUSINESS
AND YOUR BRANDY.
NO, NO, SIT DOWN. MACK'S A LAWYER.
HE LIKES AN AUDIENCE.
CHAMBERLAIN'S GOT SALT FORK
MADE A FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT.
GOT HIMSELF ELECTED JUDGE.
WHAT ABOUT JUDGE WHITE?
ONLY LOCAL MATTERS NOW.
OH, IS THAT SO?
AND HERES CHAMBERLAIN'S
MESSAGE TO YOU, JIM.
TOMORROW HE'S SENDING NOTICE TO
EVERY SQUATTER IN TOWN
AND THERE'S A WHOLE
THE WAGON TRAIN OF 'EM-
THAT THE GOVERNMENT'S
REPRESENTED HERE NOW
AND WILL THEM
FULL PROTECTION.
YOU'LL HAVE A HUNDRED CLAIMS ON
YOUR RANGE BEFORE THE WEEK IS OUT.
WHAT DO YOU THINK
WE OUGHT TO DO, MACK?
I'VE BEEN LOOKING
FOR A CHANCE-
ANY CHANCE OF ANY
KIND- TO HEAD IT OFF
BUT THERE ISN'T ANY.
IT'S THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT NOW,
THE LAW OF THE LAND,
AND IT'S OBEYED.
IT'S GOT TO BE.
WHAT DO YOU THINK, LUTIE?
I? WELL, I THINK
MACK HAS SAID IT, JIM.
IT HAD TO HAPPEN, JIM.
EVERYONE KNEW IT.
I THINK YOU DID
IN YOUR HEART.
NO.
NO, I DIDN'T, LUTIE.
WELL!
GOOD.
GOOD NIGHT DEAR.
HOW IS YOUR FINGER
WHERE YOU CUT IT?
YOU TOLD ME
IT WOULDN'T HURT.
WELL, IT WON'T HURT, EITHER.
ANYTHING YOU SAY
GOES, HUH, JIM?
SURE. SHE'S JIM'S GIRL.
HER FIRST CRUSH.
COME, SARAH BETH.
GOOD NIGHT, DEAR.
GOOD NIGHT.
GOOD NIGHT, LUTIE.
VERY NICE DINNER.
THANK YOU.
GOOD NIGHT, LUTIE.
GOOD NIGHT, JIM.
GOOD NIGHT, DEAR.
DON'T GET LUTIE
WRONG, JIM.
SHE'S A WOMAN,
AND, WELL..
I DON'T GET HER
WRONG, DOC.
IT'S JUST THAT I KEEP
WISHING SHE WAS REALLY ON MY SIDE.
WELL, HELP YOURSELVES,
GENTLEMEN.
WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO, JIM?
RIGHT NOW? GOING FOR
A LITTLE WALK.
IS THAT COLD?
BANTY,
BRING JOE.
HOLD HER A MINUTE.
CAN I GO UNDER THERE?
ANDY, YOU TAKE THE DAVIS PLACE
AND MCGEE'S RANCH.
TELL THEM I WANTS TO SEE THEM.
TELL THEM IT WON'T HURT
TO BRING THEIR WINCHESTERS.
WAKE, YOU TAKE VALEZ'S RANCH AND
THE OUTFIT SOUTH.
YOU BET, COLONEL.
GET GOING.
YOU WERE GOING
TO PUT ME TO BED.
YES, DARLING. I'LL COME RIGHT
BACK AND PUT YOU TO BED.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
I COULD CRY FOR YOU, JIM
DON'T WASTE IT
ON ME, LUTIE.
WHY DON'T YOU GO UP AND TRY TO
GET SOME SLEEP?
BECAUSE THAT'S NOT WHAT I NEED.
WHY DO YOU KEEP
LOOKING AT ME?
WHAT DO YOU KEEP
WANTING OF ME?
NOTHING, LUTIE. NOTHING ANYMORE.
I DON'T EXPECT IT.
WHAT ARE YOU GOING
TO DO, JIM?
IF CHAMBERLAIN WANTS TO DECLARE WAR,
HE'S GOING TO GET IT.
YOU'RE REALLY GOING TO GO OUT
AND SHOOT
THE FIRST HOMESTEADERS THAT
COME OVER?
THAT'S RIGHT.
IN COLD BLOOD?
IF THAT'S WHAT
YOU WANT TO CALL IT.
DON'T DO IT, JIM.
GIVE UP ON IT.
WHO ARE YOU
PROTECTING?
YOU, JIM. YOU.
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT.
WHY DO YOU WANT ME TO LOSE?
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.
BUT YOU DO, DON'T YOU?
WELL, I-I GUESS SO.
MAYBE I DO.
WHY? WHY?
I... I... MAYBE THEN
I'D HAVE A CHANCE.
MAYBE YOU'D TURN
TO ME-TO ME ALONE.
IS THAT THE ONLY REASON?
JIM, IT'S MURDER,
KILLING PEOPLE.
I DON'T KNOW
IF I COULD BEAR IT.
I... I'VE TRIED TO FIT IN, I'VE TRIED TO
BE WHAT YOU WANT, BUT...
YOU HAVE DONE THAT.
I'VE SEEN YOU TRYING.
BUT TO GO OUT
IN COLD BLOOD...
BUT I'VE SEEN OTHER THINGS I'VE SAID
NOTHING ABOUT.
THEY'RE INNOCENT PEOPLE, JIM.
I'M GOING TO DO
WHAT I HAVE TO DO.
ALL RIGHT, JIM.
ALL RIGHT, WHAT?
DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO.
I'VE NOTHING MORE TO SAY.
AND WHAT WILL YOU DO?
NOTHING. I'LL WAIT.
NOTHING MORE TO SAY?
NO.
YOU'D GO ON LIVING WITH A MURDERER,
LUTIE? WHY?
WHY DO YOU OWE ME THAT?
THAT'S A LOT.
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE DONE IT ONCE.
YOU'VE CHANGED/
WHAT CHANGED YOU?
WHY DO YOU OWE ME SO MUCH?
THE TRIP TO DENVER, MAYBE?
YOU NEVER REALLY TOLD ME
WHY YOU CAME BACK HERE.
DO YOU WANT TO TELL ME
NOW, LUTIE?
NOTHING MORE TO DAY.
WELL, I GUESS THAT
SAYS IT ALL.
IT TOOK A LONG TIME
BUT IT'S ALL SET NOW.
I TRIED, JIM. I TRIED.
MORE THAN ONCE.
BUT YOU JUST LOOKED AT ME.
YOU JUST LOOKED AT ME
AND STOPPED ME.
I COULDN'T. I COULDN'T.
BUT NOW I'M GLAD
IT'S OUT IN THE OPEN.
I DON'T CARE WHAT HAPPENS.
I'M GLAD IT'S OUT
AFTER 2 YEARS. I'M GLAD IT'S OUT.
WHEN DO YOU WANT TO LEAVE, LUTIE?
I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE.
THEN WHEN ARE YOU
GOINGTO LEAVE?
YOU CAN CATCH THE NEXT TRAIN.
YOU'D BETTER GO UP AND PACK.
WE'LL START IN THE MORNING.
I DON'T SEE HOW,
WITH ALL THE CHILDREN'S THINGS.
THE CHILDREN'S THINGS?
YOU WON'T HAVE TO PACK THOSE.
YOU THINK I'D LEAVE THEM HERE?
I'M SURE OF IT.
I COULDN'T LEAVE THEM.
YOU CAN TAKE
ONE OF THEM, LUTIE.
ONE?
YOU CAN TAKE BROCK.
BUT IF YOU TAKE HIM
YOU TAKE EVERYTHING THAT GOES WITH IT,
AND SO DOES HE.
IF YOU LEAVE HIM
I'LL BRING HIM UP, AND I'LL DO FOR HIM.
A MAN WANTS A SON.
ALL RIGHT, JIM.
I THOUGHT YOU'D
SEE IT MY WAY.
BUT I... I WON'T LET YOU KEEP
THEM FOREVER. I'LL FIGHT.
THAT'S ONE FIGHT
I WOULDN'T LOSE, LUTIE.
YOU STILL CARRY HIM
IN YOUR HEART. DON'T YOU?
I CARRY YOU
IN MY HEART, JIM
I LOVE YOU. CAN'T YOU SEE THAT?
I LOVE YOU.
YOU COULDN'T LOVE ME
AND BE AGAINST ME.
YOU'LL BOTH HAVE TO BE
VERY GOOD FOR JEFF.
AND SARAH BETH, DARLING.
YOU'LL TAKE CARE OF BRCK, WON'T YOU?
OH, DARLING, YOU'RE SO LITTLE.
YOU WON'T REMEMBER, YOU CAN'T.
I'LL REMEMBER.
THE COLONEL'S READY NOW, MRS. BREWTON.
CAN I GO FOR A RIDE TOO,
TOO, MAMA?
NOT TODAY, DARLING.
REMEMBER, I'LL BE BACK
SOONER THAN SOON,
WITH A DOUBLE
PRESENT FOR BOTH.
GOOD-BYE, JEFF.
YOU'VE BEEN A FRIEND.
DON'T YOU WORRY,
MRS. BREWTON.
SAY NICE THINGS ABOUT ME
TO MY CHILDREN, JEFF.
GOODBYE.
GOODBYE, DOC.
YOU BE GOOD.
READY?
DOC GAVE ME THIS
CHECK FROM YOU.
ALL ABOARD!
IS THIS THE WAY
WE SAY GOODBYE?
YOU SAID GOOD-BYE, LUTIE.
TWO YEARS AGO.
HE'S JUST TURNING
IN THE DOOR.
COME IN, JIM. GLAD YOU COULD
MAKE IT.
WHAT DID YOU GET ME
HERE FOR, DOC?
WELL, JIM, I GOT A FUNNY FEELING
THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE GOING
TO BE KILLED.
BUT YOU TWO
CAN STOP IT.
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, DOC.
THE LAW'S GOING TO BE
ENFORCED. THAT'S ALL.
I'LL SEE YOU LATER DOC.
DON'T BE A FOOL, BREWTON.
GO AFTER HER.
I NEVER HAD A CHANCE.
I TRIED.
I TRIED IN DENVER
AND AGAIN YESTERDAY BEFORE SHE LEFT.
YOU WERE IN THE WAY.
YOU STILL ARE.
HI, COLONEL!
WE'RE ALL SET.
EVERYBODY'S ALL HERE, COLONEL-EVERY
COWMAN WHO COULD SET A HORSE.
THERE'S MORE AMMUNITION.
TELL THEM TO HELP THEMSELVES.
I'LL BE WITH YOU IN A MINUTE.
RIGHT. HERE'S MORE AMMUNITION,
BOYS. COME AND GET IT!
COME AND GET IT, BOYS!
THERE'S MORE AMMUNITION HERE.
MORE AMMUNITION HERE...
PHELPS, WHAT ARE YOU DOING
OUT HERE, PRACTICE MARCH?
NO, I WISH IT WERE.
I'M HERE TO SEE THAT THE
HOMESTEADERS ARE LET ALONE.
OH?
NOW, DON'T LOOK AT ME
LIKE THAT, JIM.
I'M A COWMAN MYSELF.
I SETTLED OUT HERE
THE SAME TIME YOU DID.
I DON'T LIKE THIS.
BUT MY ORDERS COME FROM
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
AND THEY SAY TO KEEP
THE PEACE OUT HERE.
SO I GUESS I'M GOING
TO HAVE TO TRY.
THAT SO?
THE MEN I'VE GOT ARE GOOD MEN.
THEY'LL DO AS THEIR ORDERS READ.
A LOT OF THEM MAY DIE.
YOU'VE GOT GOOD MEN, TOO.
LOOKS AS THOUGH
YOU OUTNUMBER US.
SO YOU'D PROBABLY
WIN TODAY.
BUT NOTHING WOULD STAY WON.
THEY'D SEND A REGIMENT OUT HERE
IF IT WAS NECESSARY AND
ALL YOUR MEN WOULD BE DEAD.
NOT ONLY YOU-YOU'VE GOT A RIGHT
TO DECIDE THAT YOURSELF-BUT THEM TOO.
AS I SAID BEFORE, JIM.
THEY'RE GOOD MEN.
THEY'RE REAL GOOD MEN.
WELL, BOYS, I'M AFRAID
WE'RE NOT GOING TO FIGHT,
UNLESS SOMEBODY FEELS
DIFFERENT ABOUT IT.
SO, I GUESS WE'LL JUST GO ON HOME.
MAYBE ONE OF THESE DAYS
WE'LL BE SORRY WE DID.
THEY CAN KEEP THE NESTOR FROM
BEING BLOWN AWAY
BUT ONLY
GOD CAN HELP THE PRAIRIE.
NOW, UM, UH, LET ME UNDERSTAND
THIS CLEARLY, MR. CRANE.
UH, YOU BELIEVE THAT I MAY BE
ABLE TO GAIN CUSTODY OF MY SON
BUT TO DO THIS, I MUST
ESTABLISH IN THE COURT
UNDER OATH THE IDENTITY OF HIS FATHER?
IN ORDER TO HAVE HIM
LEGALLY, IT'S THE ONLY WAY.
AND-AND IT IS ALSO YOUR OPINION
THAT IF I DO PROVE MY RIGHT TO HIM
I MAY FORFEIT MY RIGHT
TO MY DAUGHTER?
I'M AFRAID THAT'S
THE SIZE OF IT, LUTIE.
YOU WOULD, IN THE EYES
OF THE COURT, FOREVER PROVE
YOUR UNFITNESS TO HAVE HER.
BUT WITH LUCK,
YOU COULD HAVE BROCK.
YES, WITH LUCK, I'D
SUCCEED IN BRANDING ONE,
SEPARATING THEM
FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES.
I'M SORRY, LUTIE.
WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS?
ARE YOU GOING TO STAY
IN ST. LOUIS, MY DEAR?
WELL, I DON'T KNOW,
MR. CRANE.
SINCE MY FATHER DIED
I DON'T SEEM TO BELONG
HERE ANYMORE, EITHER.
GOOD-BYE. THANK YOU
VERY MUCH.
WRITE TO ME, DOC.
LET ME KNOW ABOUT MY BABIES.
HOW THEY ARE AND WHAT THEY DO.
KEEP IN TOUCH WITH ME PLEASE.
LOVE, LUTIE.
YOU ARE MISSED, LUTIE.
IT'S LIKE SOMEBODY BLEW OUT
A LIGHT, AND IT'S A LITTLE
DARKER FOR ALL OF US.
JIM HAD THE CHILDREN IN
THE OTHER DAY FOR ME TO LOOK OVER.
AND THEY'RE HEALTHY
AS GOATS.
YOU WOULDN'T KNOW
SALT FORK, LUTIE.
THE TOWN'S JAM-PACKED EVERY DAY.
STOREKEEPERS ARE TRUCKING
TO THE HOMESTEADERS, NOW.
HARDLY EVER SEE A CATTLEMAN
ANYMORE, UNLESS IT'S
WHEN THEY COME IN TO FIGHT
AND LOSE ONE OF THE
LAWSUITS THAT'S ALWAYS BEING
SLAPPED ON THEM BY FARMERS.
THE COURT THEREFORE
FIXES DAMAGES.
FOR THE FULL MARKET VALUE
OF THE MATURED CROP.
CHAMBERLAIN WAS HEARD
TO SAY THAT GOD WAS
ON THE SIDE OF THE HOMESTEADERS.
I DON'T KNOW AS I COULD SPEAK
FOR HIM BUT I'VE GOT TO
ADMIT THAT THE CROPS ARE GOOD.
THE HEADS ON THE WHEAT ARE
SO HEAVY, THEY'LL
KNOCK A MAN'S HEAD OFF.
AND THE CORN CAN SWALLOW UP
A HORSE AND RIDER.
THIS IS RICH LAND, ALL RIGHT.
AND THE SODBUSTERS ARE
REAPING ITS FIRST FLOWER.
MAYBE THAT WHAT GOD
ORDERED, I DON'T KNOW.
YOU ASK ABOUT JIM.
WELL, HE NEVER SAYS MUCH
BUT HIS BACK'S A LITTLE STRAIGHTER
AND HIS HEAD'S A
LITTLE HIGHER THAN EVER.
SARAH BETH FOLLOWS HER FATHER AROUND
LIKE SHE WAS A LONESOME PUP.
I GOT TO ADMIT THAT JIM TREATS
HER ABOUT LIKE SHE WAS A PUP.
NOT THAT HE ISN'T GOOD TO HER.
I GUESS IT'S THIS WAY.
SARAH BETH GIVES ALL TO JIM.
AND HE GIVES IT ALL
TO BROCK.
AND BROCK... WELL, BROCK'S LIKE
HE ALWAYS WAS-
TEMPER LIKE A BUZZ SAW
AND A SMILE LIKE A FEATHERED ANGEL.
OH DOC, I AM LONELY,
BUT I KNOW I SHOULD STAY AWAY, AND
I WILL JUST AS LONG AS I CAN.
JUST AS LONG AS I CAN.
DOC!
LUTIE! OH!
OH!
I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU.
RIG IS RIGHT OVER HERE.
IT'S ALL CHANGED.
YES...
TELL ME, LUTIE, WHY DID YOU REALLY COME?
JUST TO SEE THE CHILDREN?
THAT MOSTLY. IT'S BEEN
PRETTY BAD, DOC.
WHERE'S JIM?
WAITING AT THE HOTEL.
WAITING?
TO TAKE THE CHILDREN HOME
AFTER YOU'VE SEEN THEM.
OH. DID HE MIND
ABOUT MY SEEING THEM?
HE DIDN'T SAY ONE WAY
OR THE OTHER.
DOC... WHAT ABOUT JIM?
WHERE I'M CONCERNED, I MEAN? TELL ME.
HONEY, IT'S PRETTY HARD TO SAY.
HE'S JUST NEVER MENTIONED
YOUR NAME ONE WAY OR THE OTHER.
THANK YOU.
ALL RIGHT, MRS. SMITH.
DOC... THEY DON'T KNOW ME.
THEY'RE VERY YOUNG.
IT'S BEEN TWO YEARS,
LUTIE. YOU CAN'T EXPECT IT.
NO, I DON'T EXPECT IT.
I ONLY HOPED.
DO YOU REMEMBER? I SAID I'D BRING
A DOUBLE PRESENT FOR BOTH OF YOU?
DO YOU REMEMBER, SARAH BETH?
NO.
BUT YOU'D LIKE TO HAVE A PRESENT,
WOULDN'T YOU?
YES.
THEN YOU WAIT. AND LOOK AT
WHAT I HAVE IN MY BAG.
NOW, YOU LOOK IN THE BAG.
SAW HER OFF GETTING OFF THE TRAIN
AS BIG AS LIFE.
WENT RIGHT OVER TO DOC REID'S.
YOU MUST LEAVE
AT ONCE, BRICE.
DO YOU REALIZE I'VE NEVER EVEN
TOUCHED HIM BEFORE.
NEVER BEEN CLOSE ENOUGH TO LOOK
INTO HIS EYES. HE'S A FINE BOY.
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE COME HERE.
BROCK.
JIM.
COME ON, KIDS.
TIME TO GO NOW.
I'M SORRY, LUTIE.
I SHOULDN'T HAVE
COME BACK.
I'VE BROUGHT EVERYTHING
TO LIFE AGAIN.
AND THE CHILDREN, BRICE,
THEY DON'T KNOW ME.
I'M NOT SURE THEY EVEN
LIKE ME.
THEY WERE JUST WAITING
FOR THE TIME TO GO HOME.
THEY DON'T NEED ME. THEY DON'T
NEED ANYTHING FROM ME.
LISTEN TO ME, LUTIE.
YOU AND I, WE COULD
GET BROCK. HE'S OURS.
LET BREWTON HAVE
SARAH BETH.
WE COULD TAKE BROCK AWAY
HE BELONGS WITH YOU AND ME.
WE CAN GET AS FAR AWAY FROM HERE
AS TRAINS COULD CARRY US.
THIS IS OUR LAST
CHANCE, LUTIE.
THE LAST CHANCE
FOR THE 3 OF US.
I CAN'T GO AWAY WITH YOU, BRICE.
I CAN'T HAVE BROCK.
AND I CAN'T HAVE SARAH BETH.
SO I'M GOING TO GO,
BUT I'LL GO ALONE.
AND YOU'VE GOT
NOTHING FOR ME.
NOT ENOUGH, BRICE.
NOT ENOUGH FOR THAT.
COME ON IN.
DOC?
GLAD MACK GOT
YOU HERE, JIM.
HAVEN'T BEEN SEEING
VERY MUCH OF YOU LATELY.
I HAVEN'T BEEN
LOOKING FOR YOU.
SO I NOTICED.
I USED TO LOVE YOU
LIKE THE SON I NEVER HAD.
NOT ANYMORE.
YOU KNOW WHY?
MAYBE YOU BETTER
NOT TALK ABOUT IT NOW, DOC.
I GOT TO. I'LL TELL
YOU WHY-LUTIE.
I CAN SAY IT NOW-LUTIE.
YOU WOULDN'T LET ANYBODY
SPEAK HER NAME, WOULD YOU, JIM?
BUT YOU GOT TO HUMOR ME.
LAST WISH, YOU KNOW.
ALL LUTIE NEEDED WAS...
WAS A LITTLE HELP... FROM YOU.
SHE HAD BETTER COMING
THAN SHE GOT.
SHE NEVER FORGOT HER CHILDREN.
SHE WAS ALL RIGHT.
AND YOU SENT HER
AWAY TWICE. YOUR FAULT.
THAT'S RIGHT. YOURS.
PEOPLE DON'T TELL YOU THAT
MUCH, DO THEY, JIM?
JIM.
JIM!
DO YOU HEAR ME?
YES, DOC, I HEAR YOU.
YOU'LL-YOU'LL NEVER CHANGE.
YOU'VE STILL GOT THAT SAME
LOOK IN YOUR EYES.
YOU'LL NEVER CHANGE.
THE DOC... OUT OF HIS HEAD,
I GUESS, JIM.
NO. HE WAS RIGHT.
JUST RIGHT.
HE'S GONE GENTLEMEN.
COLONEL BREWTON,
I HAVE NO IDEA.
ARE YOU SURE?
VERY SURE.
I WONDER HOW SHE'S
FIXED FOR MONEY.
MR. CAMERON LEFT
VERY LITTLE.
I SEE.
I MIGHT ADD ONE THING.
IF I DID KNOW WHERE YOUR WIFE WAS
YOU ARE THE LAST ONE I WOULD TELL.
WHY DON'T YOU
LEAVE HER ALONE NOW?
BROCK! BROCK!
WAIT A MINUTE, SISTER
LET THEM-LET THEM FINISH!
JEFF! JEFF! BROCK'S FIGHTING AGAIN!
JEFF!
BROCK! STOP THAT FIGHTING!
HEY, ED, I'M BETTING ON THE
CHAMBERLAIN KID!
WHAT'S THAT YOU SAID?
YOU HEARD WHAT I SAID.
I'M BETTING ON THE CHAMBERLAIN KID.
YOU WANT TO COVER MY BET?
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE,
JEFF?
WHAT WAS SAID
HERE, BILL?
IF ANYBODY'S GOT
ANYTHING TO SAY
NOW'S THE TIME
TO SAY IT.
COME ON, BROCK.
DON'T WORRY, LUTIE.
I'LL KEEP ON
WRITING TO YOU.
I KNOW YOU'VE TURNED TO ME
ONLY BECAUSE DOC REID IS GONE.
AND THAT YOU WANT
NOTHING FROM ME
BUT NEWS OF YOUR CHILDREN.
IN THIS LETTER, I'M SENDING
YOU A LIKENESS OF SARA BETH AND BROCK.
I OBTAINED IT BY DEVIOUS METHODS
FROM THE LOCAL
PHOTOGRAPHER.
YOU ASK
ABOUT BREWTON, LUTIE.
I KNOW VERY LITTLE
ABOUT HIM.
HE SELDOM COMES TO TOWN,
EXCEPT TO DO SOME BUYING
FOR THE RANCH NOW AND THEN.
IT WOULD BREAK YOUR HEART
TO RIDE THROUGH THIS COUNTRY NOW, LUTIE.
IT'S ALL DRYING UP
AND BLOWING AWAY.
BREWTON WAS RIGHT ABOUT ONE THING.
THIS LAND WAS NOT READY FOR THE PLOW.
IT NEEDED HELP FROM US.
DURING THOSE FIRST YEARS
WHEN THE RAINS CAME,
WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN AT WORK
PLANNING AGAINST THE TIME
WHEN NATURE WOULD FAIL US.
WE SHOULD HAVE BUILT DAMS
AND BROUGHT OUR OWN RAIN
AND IRRIGATION DITCHES
AND CULVERTS AND DIVERTED STREAMS.
SOMEDAY WE WILL DO THESE THINGS
AND THE LAND WILL COME BACK.
THE HOPE OF SEEING THAT
KEEPS ME HERE.
AND SOMETHING ELSE
HOLDS ME, TOO.
BROCK IS GROWING UP, LUTIE,
AND THE WAY IT'S HAPPENING WORRIES ME.
WHEN SARAH WAS HOME,
SHE USED TO LOOK OUT FOR HIM.
BUT NOW THAT SHE'S AWAY
AT SCHOOL,
BREWTON MAKES NO MOVE
TO CURB BROCK IN ANYTHING.
IT'S ALMOST AS THOUGH HE WERE TRYING
TO MAKE UP TO HIM FOR SOMEONE ELSE.
YOU, LUTIE.
WHATEVER IT IS,
IT'S BAD FOR BROCK AND I DON'T LIKE IT.
BUT I'M FORCED TO STAND BY
HELPLESS TO DO ANYTHING,
AND WATCH THE WILDNESS
IN THE BOY GROW STRONGER.
EVERYONE LIKES HIM.
MAYBE THAT'S THE TROUBLE.
HE'S RIGHT AT HOME EVERYPLACE.
WHETHER HE'S JOSHING THE
GIRLS AT CLANCY'S DANCE HALL,
OR PLAYING THE BLUE DANUBE
ON MYRA NETHERWOODS' NEW GRAND PIANO.
HE'S A PRIME FAVORITE.
BUT HE'S A WALKING
CONTRADICTION, TOO.
ONE DAY HE'LL BE DEALING
WESTERN EUCHRE FROM THE BEST
HORSEHAIR FURNITURE IN TOWN,
AND THE NEXT HE'LL BE PRANCING
UP AND DOWN THE STREETS IN
HIS NEW RED-WHEEL BUGGY
WITH A HOMESTEADER GIRL
BESIDE HIM.
YOU MAY SEE HIM BUYING OUT
A SHOWCASE OF JAWBREAKERS
AT THE KINGMAN MERCANTILE CO.
FOR A BUNCH OF RUNNY-NOSED KIDS,
GENTLE AS A WOMAN,
OR KEEPING A TOMATO CAN ROLLING
AT 50 FEET WITH A SIX-SHOOTER.
IT GIVES ME PAUSE, LUTIE,
TO SEE HIM.
THERE'S SUCH A LOT OF RECKLESSNESS
UNDER THAT CRAZY CHARM.
THERE'S A DANGER IN HIM
AND A KIND OF VIOLENCE.
IT'S HARD FOR ME
TO KEEP MY HANDS OFF.
SOMETIMES WHEN HE LOOKS AT ME AS WE PASS
THERE'S NEVER MORE THAN
A FLICK OF HIS EYE-
I FEEL THAT HE MUST KNOW SOMETHING,
AND THAT HE MUST HATE ME FOR IT.
I UNDERSTAND SARA BETH GRADUATED
LAST WEEK WITH HIGH HONORS.
SARAH BETH BREWTON.
HAZEL SAWYER.
THEY TELL ME
SHE'LL BE HOME SOON.
I WONDER HOW SALT FORK
WILL SEEM TO HER NOW
AFTER HER YEARS OF SCHOOLING?
PARDON ME, MA'AM.
I'M LOOKING FOR A LITTLE, SAWED-OFF,
FRECKLED, UGLY RUNT OF A GIRL.
I'M LOOKING FOR
A HANDSOME YOUNG GENTLEMAN.
WELL, YOU FOUND WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR, BUT HOW ABOUT ME?
YOU WENT AND
CHANGED ON US.
OH, BROCK!
HELLO, SARAH BETH.
WHERE'S PAPA?
PAPA!
PAPA!
GOOD TO SEE YOU,
SARAH BETH.
OH, I MIGHT HAVE KNOWN
YOU'D BE LIKE THIS, BOTH OF YOU.
LIKE WHAT?
OH, GOOD-LOOKING.
A COUPLE OF YEARS DO A LOT FOR
A YOUNG LADY, DON'T THEY?
WHAT DID YOU EXPECT-
OF ME, I MEAN?
NOT AS MUCH
AS WE GOT, EH, BROCK?
NOT HALF. I DON'T KNOW THOUGH.
LOOKS STUCK UP TO ME
PROBABLY WON'T EVEN
LIKE OUR TOWN ANYMORE.
YOUR TOWN? MY TOWN.
OH HO. MAYBE YOU'LL DO,
HUH, COLONEL?
WELL, IT'S THE SAME OLD
PLACE. SAME...
YEAH. WELL, I'M GONNA LEAVE
YOU HERE.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
RIGHT HERE. CHARLEY'S.
CARDS ARE PRETTY HOT FOR ME TODAY.
YOU BETTER NOT GET FRESH WITH
CHARLEY. HE CAN TEACH YOU.
YEAH? CHARLEY SAID YOU WERE PRETTY
GOOD AT CARDS, BUT I WAS BETTER.
I CAN TAKE CHARLEY THE BEST
DAY HE EVER LIVED
WITH YOU STANDING
ON HIS SHOULDERS.
TRY IT ANYTIME YOU SAY, COLONEL,
ANYTIME AT ALL.
I'LL BET THE WOMEN
SPOIL HIM SILLY.
YEAH.
NOT ONLY THE WOMEN
EITHER.
JEFF SAYS HE CAN CHARM THE GOLD
RIGHT OUT OF YOUR TEETH.
HOW IS JEFF, PAPA?
WELL, HE'S LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE
AROUND HERE,
LOST HIS BITE.
NOT MUCH LIKE THE NIGHTGOWN YOU WORE
WHEN I PUT YOU TO BED.
OH, JEFF.
WELL, HOW DO YOU LIKE THE WAY
I FIXED UP YOUR ROOM, HONEY?
OH, IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
AIN'T IT, THOUGH?
I GOT MY IDEA FROM ONE OF THEM
MAGAZINES.
WELL, IF YOU WANT
ANYTHING, YELL.
OH, DON'T GO.
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU.
I WANT TO KNOW
ABOUT BROCK.
WHAT YOU WANT TO KNOW?
OH, JUST HOW HE'S BEEN.
WHAT HE'S BEEN DOING.
SAME AS ALWAYS. BROCK'S BEEN HAVING
A GOOD TIME FOR BROCK.
WHAT YOU DOING?
WHERE'D THIS COME FROM?
I'VE BEEN SAVING IT.
WHY DON'T YOU ASK ME SOME MORE
QUESTIONS, SARAH BETH?
ABOUT WHAT?
ABOUT HER. AIN'T YOU CURIOUS ABOUT
YOUR MOTHER? YOU NEVER THINK OF HER?
WHAT FOR?
SHE'S YOUR MOTHER.
I DON'T KNOW
WHO SHE IS.
DON'T YOU EVER WONDER WHY
SHE'S NEVER COME TO SEE YOU?
YOU'VE ALWAYS TRIED TO SAY GOOD
THINGS ABOUT HER.
YOU'VE ALWAYS STUFFED YOUR EARS
WHEN I DID.
SHE GAVE UP A LOT WHEN SHE WENT AWAY.
AND SHE HASN'T GOT MUCH LEFT NOW.
HOW ABOUT PAPA?
HAS HE GOT ANYTHING LEFT?
HE'S GOT YOU.
HE'S GOT BROCK.
YEAH-BROCK.
PLEASE STOP WHISTLING.
YOU CAN'T BEAT THAT, BOY.
NOBODY CAN BEAT THAT, KID.
THAT'S RIGHT, CHARLEY.
NOBODY EVER HAS. YOU OUGHT
TO KNOW THAT, BILL.
YEAH, I KNOW.
OH, HAVE YOU GOT 6, TOO?
LOOK, KID, GAMBLING IS MY BUSINESS.
YEAH.
AND I KNOW MY BUSINESS.
AFTER THIS, IF I'VE GOT 6 CARDS,
I'LL MAKE IT KNOWN.
SURE. YOU BET.
YOU DEAL.
ANY OF YOU BOYS SEEN CHAMBERLAIN
AROUND? JUDGE CHAMBERLAIN?
NO. WHAT DO YOU WANT WITH HIM?
HIS OFFICE WANTS HIM.
TRY THE BANK.
FORGET IT, JOE.
HE DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING.
IT'S ALL RIGHT, CHARLEY.
ALL RIGHT, KID.
YOU'RE THE JUDGE.
JUDGE OF WHAT?
GO AHEAD. DEAL.
THANK YOU, JUDGE.
$10.
I'LL LET YOU OFF WITH A LIGHT SENTENCE.
PAIR OF 9s.
PAIR OF DOGS.
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU HAD A TWIN
BROTHER, JUDGE.
ALL RIGHT, BROCK, THE DOOR'S OPEN.
TEMPORARY ANYHOW.
WHO OPENED IT
FOR ME, BILL?
SUPPOSE I OUGHT TO SAY THANKS.
I DON'T KNOW THE PARTY.
BROCK, YOU'RE HOME!
PAPA, BROCK'S HOME.
WELL, WERE YOU STILL AS LUCKY?
OH, SURE.
I'M ALWAYS LUCKY.
STOP THAT.
PLAY SOMETHING ELSE.
LIKE?
OH, ANYTHING BUT
THAT FUNERAL MARCH.
PLAY SOMETHING WITH PEOPLE IN IT.
CAN'T HAVE A FUNERAL
WITHOUT PEOPLE.
HAD DINNER?
YEAH, ATE AT BEATTY'S PLACE
ON THE WAY OUT.
BROCK SAID HE WAS LUCKY AGAIN, PAPA.
REALLY? THAT'S FUNNY.
LOOKS TO ME LIKE THE BOYS TOOK HIM.
THEY TRIED. I WAS PLAYING WITH
JOE HORTON.
HORTON? HE'S A BAD BOY. YOU
WANT TO LOOK OUT FOR HIM.
I DID, IN ONE HAND,
ESPECIALLY.
WE BOTH DREW ONE,
ONLY I DREW FIRST.
GOT HIM RIGHT
IN THE BELLY.
YOU MEAN
YOU SHOT HIM.
NOT CONCLUSIVELY.
HE'S GOING TO LIVE.
WHAT HAPPENED?
HOW'D THE FIGHT START?
AH, I HAD A FEW TOO MANY, I GUESS.
I DON'T REMEMBER.
I NEVER SAW YOU
THAT DRUNK.
THEN I'M A-LYIN'.
HOW LONG WERE YOU IN JAIL?
NOT LONG.
WHO GOT YOU OUT?
MCCURTIN?
HASN'T HE ALWAYS
BEFORE?
YEAH. WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO TELL
ME HOW THE FIGHT STARTED?
I TOLD YOU. I WAS DRUNK.
NOW, IF YOU'D RATHER I HADN'T
COME HOME, I'LL GET OUT.
I'D RATHER YOU DIDN'T LIE, BROCK.
NOW, COME ON, LET'S GO
INTO TOWN.
AND FACE WHATEVER'S
GOT TO BE FACED.
NOT ME. I'M GOING
TO DENVER.
YOU'RE GOING TO SALT FORK,
BROCK,
AND GET THIS THING OVER WITH
AND THEN YOU'RE COMING BACK HERE.
AND IT MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA
IF YOU SPENT A LITTLE MORE TIME
HERE IN THE FUTURE.
YOU CAN'T RUN ME
ANYMORE!
I WASN'T CUT OUT FOR LIVING YOUR WAY
AND I'M SICK OF TRYING.
I'D RATHER BE STUFFED
IN A COFFIN!
I DON'T MIND THE SHOOTING SO MUCH-
I WOULDN'T GIVE MUCH FOR YOU IF
YOU COULDN'T DEFEND YOURSELF-
BUT JUMPING BAIL IS ANOTHER THING.
IT ISN'T SQUARE.
I WANT YOU TO GO INTO TOWN
AND STAND TRIAL ON YOUR OWN FEET.
CLEAR YOURSELF OR TAKE
THE CONSEQUENCES.
BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY
TO WORK IT OUT, BROCK.
WHEN YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING MORE
TO SAY TO ME, I'LL BE AROUND.
THAT WAS NICE.
THAT WAS FINE.
TAKE IT EASY.
YOU KNOW YOU CAN
HURT HIM MORE THAN ANYONE.
YOU KNOW THAT, DON'T YOU?
TAKE IT EASY, SARAH BETH.
I THOUGHT
YOU WERE LEAVING.
I GOT TO THINK.
HOW CAN A MAN THINK
WITHOUT A LITTLE MUSIC?
JIM HERE?
AROUND SOME PLACE.
OUT BACK, I GUESS.
WHERE'S BROCK?
HELLO, MR. MCCURTIN.
YOU TELL HIM ABOUT
THE SHOOTING, BROCK?
OH, HELLO, MACK.
SURE I TOLD HIM. WHAT'S THE MATTER?
HORTON DIED.
FIGURED HE WAS
TOO MEAN TO DIE.
I CAN GET YOU OFF
ONCE MORE, MAYBE.
YOU MUST HAVE HAD A GOOD REASON
TO SHOOT A MAN.
YOU HAD ONE,
DIDN'T YOU?
GOOD REASON?
WHY, SURE-THE BEST.
BETTER COME BACK IN WITH ME.
HAVE YOU TOLD
THE COLONEL?
I CAN'T FACE HIM.
I'VE GONE THAT ONE TIME OVER
BRINGING HIM BAD NEWS.
ARE YOU COMING?
NO.
THEN I'M FINISHED, BROCK,
AS FAR AS YOU'RE CONCERNED.
TOO MUCH FOR ME.
ONE LAST WORD-
I ADVISE YOU TO GET IN TOWN FAST.
SARAH BETH, TELL YOUR FATHER
I COULDN'T WAIT.
YOU CAN GET OUT OF THIS YOURSELF OR
THE WAY YOU GOT OUT OF JAIL.
WHAT DID MR. MCCURTAIN MEAN,
"THE WAY YOU GOT OUT OF JAIL"?
HE GOT YOU OUT, DIDN'T HE?
NO.
WHO DID?
CHAMBERLAIN.
I GUESS HE FIGURES
THE YOUNG AND FOOLISH
SHOULD HAVE ANOTHER CHANCE,
OR SOMETHING.
ALL RIGHT, BROCK, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO COVER UP WITH ME.
I'VE KNOWN FOR A LONG TIME.
WHEN?
FOR SURE WHEN I WAS 15.
HOW?
A LOT OF THINGS
PUT TOGETHER.
AND BEFORE I WENT BACK TO SCHOOL
THE LAST TIME, I KNEW YOU KNEW IT
AND I KNEW PAPA DID.
I COULD KILL CHAMBERLAIN.
THAT'S WHAT THE
TROUBLE WAS ABOUT.
THIS FELLOW I WAS GAMBLING WITH,
HE SAID A FEW THING.
THAT'S WHY I COULDN'T
TELL THE COLONEL.
I COULDN'T LET HIM
KNOW THAT I KNOW.
OH, BROCK.
WE'VE BEEN AROUND A LOT
TOGETHER, THE COLONEL AND ME.
AND HE NEVER LET ANYBODY
EVEN THINK ANYTHING ONCE,
AT LEAST NOT OUT LOUD.
DON'T I KNOW.
I'M GLAD I KNOW THAT, TOO-
I MEAN, THAT YOU LOVE HIM.
IF I HATED HIM,
I'D BE ALL RIGHT.
THEN WE COULD WALK DOWN
THE STREET TOGETHER
AND I WOULDN'T MIND FEELING
HIM CRINGE-NEVER LET ON.
OH, I SHOULD HAVE GONE Movie AWAY
FROM HERE A LONG TIME AGO.
BUT HE'S HARD TO LEAVE.
NOW I GOT TO GET
OUT OF HERE FAST.
DON'T RUN AWAY, BROCK.
MR. MCCURTIN COULD GET
YOU OFF, COULDN'T HE?
OH, SURE, EASY. THE JURY WOULDN'T
EVEN LEAVE ITS BOX.
THEN FACE IT LIKE
PAPA WANTS YOU TO.
EVER BEEN TO A TRIAL,
SARAH BETH?
LOTS OF THINGS COME OUT OF TRIALS.
WHOLE MESS COMES OUT.
SALT FORK WOULD EAT
THIS UP WITH A SPOON,
AND HE'S HAD ENOUGH.
GO ON, SARAH BETH, SIT DOWN AND
PLAY A TUNE BY YOURSELF.
YOU'LL HAVE TO GET USED TO IT.
AND TELL THE COLONEL NOTHING.
JEFF SAID MCCURTIN WAS HERE.
WHAT DID HE WANT?
NOTHING.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
FIRST LAP OF
MY TRIP TO DENVER.
GET DOWN OFF THAT HORSE, BROCK.
GET OUT OF MY WAY.
WELL, SARAH BETH, I'LL TRY TO
UNDERSTAND WHY HE HAD TO GO.
I DIDN'T TRY WITH SOMEONE
ELSE A LONG TIME AGO.
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN SORRY.
WELL, COLONEL, THEN
IF BROCK AIN'T HERE
WE JUST GOTTA FIND HIM
AND TAKE HIM IN.
WHY?
I THOUGHT MCCURTIN
TOLD YOU.
HORTON DIED.
SORRY, COLONEL.
THINGS FALL THAT WAY
SOMETIMES, BILL.
YEAH.
YOU SURE HE AIN'T HERE?
YOU CAN LOOK.
I... I SHOULDN'T HAVE ASKED THAT,
COLONEL. GOOD NIGHT.
WHY IS BROCK FRIGHTENED, SARAH BETH?
DOESN'T HE KNOW MACK CAN GET HIM OFF?
BUT HE KNOWS HE CAN'T GET
YOU OFF.
THE MAN BROCK SHOT,
HE CALLED BROCK NAMES.
NOT PRETTY NAMES,
EITHER.
THEY'D SOUND AWFUL AT A TRIAL,
ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY'RE TRUE.
BROCK THOUGHT-HE WANTED TO
SPARE YOU SOMETHING.
HE CAN'T SPARE ME
ANYTHING.
IT SEEMS NONE OF US CAN
SPARE THE OTHERS ANYTHING.
YOU GO TO BED.
I'VE GOT TO FIND HIM.
I'VE GOT TO GET TO HIM
BEFORE HE DOES SOMETHING.
I'VE GOT TO GET TO HIM
BEFORE SOME SHERIFF GETS HIM.
HE'S A GOOD BOY,
SARAH BETH.
YES. I'M GLAD WE KNOW HOW GOOD.
YOU FIND HIM, PAPA.
I'LL FIND HIM.
GET YOUR AFTERNOON STAR-
HERE'S YOUR CHANGE, LADY.
LATEAFTERNOON STAR.
THANK YOU, SIR.
RIGHT OVER HERE-
GET YOUR LATE AFTERNOON STAR!
AFTERNOON STAR! LATEST NEWS AND
THE LATEST PAPER!
RIGHT HERE. THAT THE IDEA.
THANK YOU, SIR.
LATE AFTERNOON STAR!
RIGHT OVER HERE! GET
YOUR LATE AFTERNOON STAR!
HERE COMES THE COLONEL.
HE'S IN THAT
CABIN, COLONEL.
YOU CAN'T GO DOWN THERE, COLONEL!
THE BOY'S GONE CRAZY!
GO ON BACK!
NO ONE'S TAKING ME, AND
THAT GOES FOR YOU, TOO!
STAY THERE, OR I'LL DROP
YOU! I MEAN IT!
YOUR LAST CHANCE
TO TURN AROUND!
I'LL COUNT 3!
HURRY IT UP!
OH, DAD. WHY AM I
CALLING YOU DAD?
YOU USED TO CALL
ME THAT, BROCK.
NOT SINCE I GOT OLD
ENOUGH TO KNOW BETTER.
GROWING UP-THAT'S
GREAT, ISN'T IT?
DON'T TALK.
DON'T TALK.
YOU DON'T SCARE
WORTH A NICKEL, DAD.
DOCS ALWAYS TRY SOMETHING.
LIE STILL, KID.
LIE STILL. NOT WHILE I'M STILL
BREATHING IN AND OUT.
LYING STILL COMES LATER.
NOT MUCH LATER, THOUGH,
HUH, DOC?
HELLO, SHERIFF!
SOMEBODY LEFT
A NOTE FOR YOU.
RIGHT SIDE OF YOU.
BROCK.
YOUR SISTER SENDS
HER LOVE, SON.
THE GOOD GIRL.
GOOD, BRIGHT GIRL.
SHE TOLD ME, BROCK.
SHE TOLD ME WHY YOU
DUCKED OUT.
AND, BROCK...
YOUR MOTHER...
THERE'S SOMETHING...
DAD, LET'S GO DOWN
TO CHARLEY'S, HMM?
LET'S DRINK ALL THE PLACE
UNDER THE TABLE.
AND THEN WHEN THERE'S
JUST ME AND YOU LEFT
I'LL DRINK YOU UNDER.
ASK CHARLEY.
HOW ABOUT IT?
DA-DAD...
DAD.
I GOT IT FOR YOU,
LAST STOP, MA'AM.
GOT ANYTHING
FOR ME TO PICK UP?
NO. NOTHING TODAY.
I BEG YOUR PARDON, IS THERE
A TRAIN LEAVING
FOR SAN FRANCISCO TOMORROW?
ONE AT 11:00 O'CLOCK TONIGHT.
THANK YOU.
AND SO WE'LL COME TO
PAY OUR LAST RESPECTS
AND TO SAY GOODBYE
TO BROCK BREWTON
BELOVED SON OF JAMES BREWTON
AND LUTIE C. BREWTON.
THIS YOUNG MAN HAS
DEPARTED FROM OUR MIDST.
THE LORD GAVE.
THE LORD HATH TAKEN AWAY.
LET US PRAY.
COME IN.
JUST PUT THE COFFEE
ON THE TABLE, PLEASE.
YOU'RE SARAH BETH.
YES.
PLEASE SIT DOWN.
THERE'S NO NEED
FOR THAT.
I HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY, AND THEN
I'M GOING TO GO.
HOW DID YOU KNOW
I WAS HERE?
I HAVE A ROOM AT THE HOTEL.
THE CLERK TOLD ME.
I'M NOT GOING TO LET YOU HURT
POP ANYMORE!
HE CAN'T STAND ANYMORE.
MAYBE YOU COULDN'T HURT HIM,
EVEN IF YOU TRIED.
MAYBE THERE'S NOT ANYTHING THAT
CAN HURT HIM,
NOT AFTER BROCK.
I HOPE SO.
BECAUSE NOBODY CAN STAND
ANYMORE, EVEN HIM.
SO MAYBE THE PAIN'S
OVER NOW.
UNLESS YOU BROUGHT HIM MORE.
HAVE YOU?
WHAT DO YOU
WANT OF HIM?
NOTHING.
I CAME TO HELP BROCK.
I DIDN'T KNOW HE-
I... I DIDN'T KNOW UNTIL THE TRAIN
WAS ALMOST HERE.
I'M NOT EVEN GOING TO SEE
YOUR FATHER, SARAH BETH.
I MIGHT TRY IF I THOUGH
I COULD MAKE UP
A LITTLE TO HIM. AND TO YOU FOR
ALL THE YEARS,
BUT I KNOW I COULDN'T.
HE TRIED TO TELL ME
HOW HE FELT,
HOW THE GRASS WAS SOMEHOW
GODLY TO HIM.
HE TRIED TO TELL ME
AND I DIDN'T HEAR.
AND HE WAS RIGHT.
THOSE YEARS ARE GONE,
AND MY CHANCE WITH HIM.
I'LL LEAVE TONIGHT, SARAH BETH,
BUT I'M NOT SORRY
I CAME NOW,
BECAUSE I'LL TAKE SOMETHING
BACK WITH ME
WHICH MEANS
A GREAT DEAL TO ME:
THE KNOWLEDGE
THAT HE HAS YOU-
YOU TO FIGHT FOR HIM,
BE THERE WHEN HE NEEDS YOU,
TO BE WHAT I WASN'T
STRONG ENOUGH TO BE.
HE DIDN'T COME TO ST. LOUIS
FOR NOTHING.
AND NOW, WHEN HE'S LOST
IT ALL, EVERYTHING,
WHEN HE NEEDS SOMETHING
HUMAN AT LAST,
YOU COME INTO THE FIELD.
NO, HE DIDN'T COME
TO ST. LOUIS FOR NOTHING.
AND ALL AT ONCE
THAT GIVES ME... PEACE.
A KIND OF HAPPINESS EVEN.
I HAVEN'T FELT THAT
FOR A VERY LONG TIME.
JUST ONE THING.
SOME NIGHT WHEN HE'S SITTING
ON THE PORCH, SARAH BETH,
GIVE HIM A KISS FROM ME.
OH, DON'T...
I'M GLAD YOU'RE HOME, COLONEL.
THE BUCKBOARD WITH
SARAH BETH GET IN?
I MISSED SEEING HER START.
MAYBE YOU'D BETTER
GO ON IN THE HOUSE, COLONEL.

PAPA, COME HERE.
PAPA, COME HERE.
MOTHER WANTED TO BE
WAITING FOR YOU HERE, PAPA.
THE WAY SHE USED TO BE.
LUTIE?
YOU'RE WELL?

PAPA.
IT WAS A HARD THING
FOR HER TO GO THROUGH,
BUT SHE'S ONE
IN A THOUSAND.
NO ONE ELSE WILL EVER BE LIKE HER.
