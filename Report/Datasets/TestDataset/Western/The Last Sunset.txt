I need some
horseshoe nails.
Well, I have all sizes.
Some new and
some old. Select.
How much are they?
I'm looking for a man
named O'Malley.
Fellow about your height,
wears black pants and shirt,
black boots.
Carries a derringer.
He always wears
a loud-colored scarf
around his neck.
Has a hole in his chin.
Here.
It's worth 50 pesos
if anybody's seen him.
They are desolate
they cannot help you.
But, 50 pesos,
This man must be
a very dear friend, no?
No.
Jack-boy!
You be quiet.
Good evening.
Good evening.
The name's O'Malley.
How do you do, Mr. O'Malley?
I'm Mrs. John Breckenridge.
My husband's gone to
Calvillo on business.
Sorry to hear that.
I was hoping to ask him
for a night's hospitality.
Mr. Breckenridge has
always welcomed strangers
to the plateau.
I'm grateful to
Mr. Breckenridge.
Won't anybody take care
of the gentleman's horse?
Mr. O'Malley,
this is Milton Wing,
Mr. Breckenridge's
ranch manager.
Howdy.
This horse's been
lathered up some.
Well, I'd say that's
because he was run some,
wouldn't you?
Guess so.
This is Jose. Rosario.
My daughter.
Oh.
She favors you.
You're a lucky young lady.
This is Melissa Linda
Anthony Breckenridge.
We call her Melissa.
Well, how do you do,
Melissa?
Oh.
Thank you.
Well, I'd be most grateful
to Mr. Breckenridge
for my supper.
Are you a cowboy,
Mr. O'Malley?
What have I done
to give you that idea?
You don't dress like one,
so I just wondered.
No, I don't like
cows much.
And the only way
I really like a horse
is when he's hitched
to a nice two-seater buggy
with good springs.
I ran into a cowboy
this morning
up at the pass.
Seemed to be looking
for somebody.
Tall man?
Sure was.
I never really met
an American cowboy.
You'd be disappointed.
Was he riding a blue roan?
That's right.
What makes you think
I'd be disappointed?
Well, you see,
cowboys aren't
very bright.
They're always broke
and generally they're drunk.
Did he carry his
gun on the left?
Yep... 45 on the left.
You may get the chance
to meet one
in the flesh real soon.
You know this fellow?
I know of him.
We've never met,
but we will.
Mrs. Breckenridge,
will you do me
the honor of dancing?
No.
I dance vary rarely,
Mr. O'Malley. And then
only with my husband.
He's to be envied.
Then dance with me,
Mr. O'Malley.
I love to dance.
O'MALLEY: I'd be delighted.
Do you want to
try it again?
Sure...
It's time for bed, Melissa.
Oh, no, not yet.
Yes.
Are you going to
sleep in the house,
Mr. O'Malley?
You know Mr. Breckenridge
has a special room
in the toolhouse for guests.
MISSY: Oh, well. Good night.
O'MALLEY: Good night.
I'll show him.
Never mind,
I'll show him myself.
Here's your lamp.
Your bed's up there.
Why did you
have to come back?
I ran into somebody who
told me your married name
and where you were.
I started riding
that same day.
You're lying.
You came here to hide.
There's someone on my trail,
sure. There always is.
But I haven't been
running away from him,
I've just been coming to you.
And now I'm here.
And I'm not hiding.
And I'm going to stay.
No, Bren.
You're leaving tomorrow
and you're not coming back.
Belle.
I can't leave you now.
I never did
leave you, really.
All these years
I've remembered you
as you were that night.
A pretty girl
coming down the steps
in a yellow dress.
And another boy
asked me to dance.
You began that awful whistle
and just watched for a minute.
Then you tore my flowers off
and knocked him down.
I know,
but that's all in the past.
That part of me is over.
It took
three men to stop you.
You were killing him.
I'm trying to tell you
that I've changed.
I'm completely different now.
You'll see.
You still got
that yellow dress?
I burned it.
I'll get you another one.
Oh, Belle. Belle...
Belle, remember that night?
The music floating down
from your uncle's house,
me sitting by my campfire,
thinking of you dancing
in the arms of other men
and wanting to kill someone.
And then I looked up,
you were standing there.
Standing beside my fire
in your yellow dress
like a flame.
Oh, Belle.
Belle.
Oh, please,
keep away from me.
I'm afraid of you.
Whatever you say, Belle.
Why do you wear
your gun in your belt?
Well, I like to know
exactly where it is.
In your belt,
you can feel it right up there
against you all the time.
Papa says a derringer
hasn't got any range.
He always wears a Colt 45.
Oh, I'm sorry
to hear that, miss.
Why?
Well, no handgun's accurate
beyond 20 feet.
And no holster gun
can draw as fast as
a derringer.
My papa greases the
inside of his holster.
I'm afraid that wouldn't
do him any good.
Also, the derringer carries
a bigger slug, miss.
You can call me
Melissa, if you like.
Well, let's just compromise.
I'll call you Missy.
What's the matter?
MISSY: Oh, it's only Papa.
Good morning,
child of my heart.
Rosario, come
get Papa's horse.
JOHN: Good morning, my dear.
Good, I say, because it's
one of the last we'll spend
on this accursed ranch.
Did you find trail hands?
Just one.
But I'm sure two
or three more will
join us directly.
Not many people
want to work for
a living these days.
Oh, John,
this is Mr. O'Malley.
How do you do?
Welcome, Mr. O'Malley.
Permit me to offer you
the hospitality of these
poor acres.
O'MALLEY: Thank you,
Mr. Breckenridge.
We have a saying
down here in Mexico,
to which I hardly subscribe.
"Everything that's
mine is yours."
It's a fine saying.
I'll remember it.
You'll join me in coffee?
Thank you.
JOHN: O'Malley...
I knew some O'Malleys
in Virginia. Tidewater?
I'm afraid
they'd be lace curtain,
my people were all shanty.
After you, sir. Take that
chair right over there.
I take you for a man
who's handled quite a
lot of cattle in his time.
Oh, I've done
a little bit of
almost everything.
Well, I run about
I plan to trail the herd
up to Texas and
sell them there.
Now if you're at
liberty, I could...
Mr. O'Malley
was trailing south.
North or south doesn't make
much difference to me,
Mrs. Breckenridge.
There, you see?
I'm sure my wife echoes
my sentiments in hoping you'll
join us on the trail, sir.
I don't think Mr. O'Malley
would be influenced
by my wishes.
I hope you won't
always think that, ma'am.
I'm sure that's not
what she meant.
Touch up your coffee?
Thanks.
I'm willing to pay you
a dollar a day, in fact.
Plus a $25 bonus
when we deliver the herd
in Crazy Horse, Texas.
Crazy Horse?
That's pretty
dangerous country
you're going through.
And you need
two men you haven't got.
Fast gun and a trail boss.
I don't know any more
about cows than you do,
so if I go as the gun,
where's the trail boss?
Well, I haven't got one.
I wasn't able to find anybody.
I know one. Good one.
Think you can get him?
He'll probably be
here by tomorrow.
Maybe even today.
You think he'll take the job?
He just might.
You see, this fellow and
I are kind of bound up
with each other.
But with or without him,
my terms are gonna be
pretty high.
Well, you just
name your terms,
Mr. O'Malley.
Only two.
First I take
a fifth of the herd.
It's outrageous.
Well, I fight better when
part of the property's mine.
But that's exorbitant.
You think about it.
All right. All right,
you've got your fifth.
Good.
Now, wait a minute, you
said you had two conditions.
What's the second?
Oh, yes, the second.
I want your wife.
You're joking.
No.
If I get the herd
through for you,
I mean to take your wife.
You? You and my wife?
You and Mrs. Breckenridge...
A dirty shirt Irishman
and a Fitzleigh from Richmond.
Yes, I'll accept your
challenge. Yes, indeed.
And you can go to work.
You can go to work at once.
Hold it, O'Malley!
They told me
you'd try to circle around
to get the sun in my eyes.
You did a little
circling yourself.
Insurance.
The sun was in
Jimmy Graham's face
when you killed him.
I don't remember.
Well, a lot of
people do.
I got a warrant
for your arrest.
I'm taking you back to
Frio County, Texas,
to stand trial.
Will you come voluntarily
or will I have to take you?
Say, it just happens
that I'm just headed
for Texas right now.
Crazy Horse. Of course,
it isn't Frio County,
but you'd die
a lot closer to home than
if I had to kill you here.
All right, let's go.
I'm running these
cattle up there.
You?
Yeah.
With a drunken owner,
no trail boss, a few
and myself.
What do you want in that
outfit you're willing
to risk a hanging for?
Why don't you ride over
and find out?
Why not?
You know,
Sheriff, this is Mexico.
Your warrant's no good here.
I'll serve it
as soon as we cross
the Rio Grande.
JOHN: Is that the gentleman
you were telling me about,
Mr. O'Malley?
That's him.
They need a trail boss.
Mmm-hmm.
With just the two of us
riding, I can always
keep you in sight.
But trailing cattle,
it'd be too easy to catch
a bullet in the back.
I hope Mr. O'Malley has
discussed the possibilities
of your joining up with us?
He has.
I'm not interested.
Why that's most unsettling.
I was counting on it.
You have any idea
what you're getting
yourself into?
There's nothing
on that trail but
rustlers and Indians.
And Johnny Rebs who crossed
the border to steal what they
couldn't win in a fair fight.
I do beg your pardon.
I almost lost a leg
at Fredericksburg
in as fair a fight as
this world has ever seen.
I'm a Virginian and
an officer in the armies
of the Confederacy.
I'm from Virginia, too,
except I served under Grant.
Oh, I beg your pardon.
Oh, forgive me.
My dear, allow me
to present Mr...
Stribling.
Dana Stribling.
Mr. Stribling, my wife.
JOHN: Almost forgot her.
I don't see how that
could be possible.
Well, bravo, you are
really a Virginian.
Why don't I
show Mr. Stribling
around the place?
Might help him
change his mind.
JOHN: That's a mighty
good idea, Mr. O'Malley.
It's right gracious of you.
Ma'am.
You know,
I've got a nasty feeling
I've seen you before.
You were too drunk
to remember.
Bents Fort, Colorado.
So broke
you were making up
rhymes for whiskey.
One free drink,
one free verse.
What's the matter?
Cost you a drink?
I'm gonna see that
you hang, O'Malley.
Ooh! Hanging's
a long-time proposition.
Well, Mr. Breckenridge,
to pull the 1,000
head of cattle,
you need two good point
riders, four swing riders,
and one man on the tail.
You need a man to drive
the mules, a trail cook,
a wrangler for the horses,
plus four horses
in the remuda
for each rider.
I got plenty of horses
in the remuda.
My wife drove a chuck wagon
coming down here
and she's perfectly willing
to drive one going back.
And she's an
excellent trail cook.
Then she counts
for two men.
You've married well.
You ride, miss?
Oh, yes. I can even
work cattle on a horse.
DANA: Good.
She can ride herd on
the remuda. Give us
another hand for the cattle.
My daughter's a lady.
A Southern lady.
If I'm trail boss,
my word goes
when it comes to
running the cattle,
is that right?
Well, whatever you say.
We're ready to go.
Melissa.
We'll see how Milton's
doing with the herd.
Fine, Papa.
Mrs. Breckenridge,
it's not often I interfere
in somebody else's business,
but this is
one of the times
I think I should.
O'Malley's a killer,
and as soon as he crosses
the border into Texas,
I'm gonna see that he hangs.
Until then, my advice to you
is to keep your door locked
when he's around.
He can't tell
one female from another.
And he don't care much,
either.
BELLE: Please,
don't cause trouble.
Why did you say those things
about Mr. O'Malley?
Because they're true.
I'm not a child,
Mr. Stribling. I'm perfectly
able to take care of myself.
It won't happen again.
It's a nice night,
isn't it?
Miss out on the nights,
you miss half your life.
Are you a killer?
Now, why do you
ask me that?
What they say.
Well, when you come
right down to it, all men
in their hearts are killers.
But that's wrong.
Maybe it is.
I don't know.
When a man kills,
it means God let him,
because God could stop him
if he wanted to, couldn't he?
I don't understand.
Well, you asked
if I'm a killer,
I'm trying to tell you
it's not an easy question
to answer,
but I have killed.
But you didn't
want to, did you?
No.
Do you like God?
Do you like God?
Well, of course, but...
I don't know him really.
Do you?
Part of him.
Someday I'm going to
know all of him.
Oh, not all of him, Missy.
That'd be too much
for anyone to know.
It would blind you.
Just learn to know
rocks and trees
and stars and sunlight.
They're all
part of God, too.
Learn to know the sea.
I will when we
get to California.
Good. Find yourself
a nice big boulder with
the waves breaking against it.
Look deep.
Dream of seahorses
and they'll come.
Not many people know of it,
not many people care,
but the sea is a place where
the seamen shoe the hooves
of the wild sea-mare.
Not many people have seen it,
nor caught the faintest gleam
of the ice-green cave
in the deep green sea
in the heart of
the cold sea-stream,
where the sea-mare hides
her young sea-colt
wrapped in a shy sea-dream.
But practically
all of the people known
can absolutely say
that the foam on the sea
is a sign that you see
the mare and her colt at play.
Oh, I like that.
Did you make that up?
A drunk made that up,
sitting in a saloon
in Bents Fort, Colorado.
Give him a subject, he'd
write a verse. "One free
drink, one free verse."
That must've been
a part of God, too.
God in him.
Of course it was.
God has a special love
for drunks and fools
and children like you.
I'm not a child.
I'm almost 16 years old.
I'm a woman.
Oh, Missy.
Put it away.
When I kill you,
it'll be face-to-face
with both of us on our feet.
I'd like to believe that.
O'MALLEY: You can.
And here's something else
you can believe, too.
Never talk to me again
the way you did tonight.
The truth hurts,
doesn't it?
The truth hurts.
I'd like to know
the truth about you.
Just being sheriff
isn't enough reason
to follow a man this far.
What was Jimmy Graham to you?
Hmm?
He was married to my sister.
Your sister?
Mmm.
So that's where
the bear sits,
in the buckwheat.
Mr. Stribling!
You left a calf behind.
Where?
He lost his mother.
Well, we'll have to
give him a new one.
Come on.
Come over here, miss.
Now, blow your breath
three or four times in
each side of his nose.
Go ahead.
Keep on petting him.
That's right.
Now, stay right where
you are so you're
the first thing he sees.
Get back on your horse.
See, miss, cattle
don't see very well.
The only way this
little fellow can tell his
mother from any other cow
is by her smell.
When he loses that,
he's an orphan.
So we give him
a new smell to follow.
You're his new mama.
Now, walk away slowly,
see what he does.
Thanks for saving
that calf back there.
Why should you thank me?
Well, that calf
could have been mine.
Yours?
Sure.
You see, part of my deal
with Breckenridge was that
I get a fifth of the herd.
A fifth?
Well, I delivered him
the best trail boss
in the business, didn't I?
That's worth something,
isn't it?
Come on now, my fifth.
Hey, there!
Come on there, boy!
Mr. Stribling,
you may make camp
wherever you wish.
I'm riding on ahead
to Tres Santos.
That's a pretty
rough town,
Mr. Breckenridge.
I think I can find
extra hands there.
This time you can
really count on me, Mrs. B.
I swear I'd sooner
milk a wildcat.
Come on, Jack-boy.
Come on, Jack-boy.
Jack-boy, come on. Come on.
Come on, Jack-boy.
Come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on, Jack-boy.
That's a boy.
Your husband get back
from town yet?
No. I hope he hasn't
run into any trouble.
Maybe I ought to ride in,
see how he's making out.
I wish you would.
DANA: All right.
Get me some tobacco,
will you?
I don't know your brand.
Oh, any kind will do.
Maybe you ought to
come along.
Pick it out yourself.
Oh, it's not that important.
Take your time.
I'll just stick around here
and keep an eye on things.
Right, Jackie-boy?
I only suggested
you come along.
Now I'm telling you to.
On your way, cowpoke.
DANA: That's an order,
O'Malley.
What did you say?
Bren, please go with him.
Don't make trouble for us.
Whatever you want, Belle,
that's the way
it's going to be.
Gentlemen, our cups
are running dry of nectar.
Patron,
a drink for my friends,
and everyone is my friend.
Bartender, drinks all around.
Gentlemen!
Gentlemen, gentlemen.
A toast to a great soldier,
a devout Christian.
To the bravest of the brave,
General Stonewall Jackson.
You're not fit to
speak that name, sir.
At whose side it was
my privilege to fight
during the long and
tragic years of the war
between the states.
Gentlemen,
I give you General...
Reach for your gun, sir.
I decline
to shed the blood
of a fellow Virginian.
You decline
every kind of a fight,
don't you?
It's right
nice seeing you again,
Breckenridge.
We had the privilege
of fighting alongside him
under Stonewall Jackson
at Fredericksburg.
And he ran.
That's not true.
He didn't just run,
he deserted us!
That's just not true.
I was wounded at
Fredericksburg.
Where were
you wounded?
Go ahead and show us
where you were wounded,
Breckenridge.
Yes, sir. Show us.
We would all like to see.
Well, the wound is obvious.
I limp...
Drop your pants
and show us
your backside.
You've no right to
ask me to do that.
Your pants.
Or your gun.
Show us your wound.
Oh, God,
is there no mercy?
Show us the wound!
Talking's all right,
you can say anything you want,
but no man has the right
to make another man do this.
MAN: Keep out of this.
What's he to you, sir?
Don't ask questions, mister.
Just do what the man says.
Let's get out...
Now wait a minute...
You shut up!
Let's go, Mr. Breckenridge.
I don't think
we're welcome here.
How'd my papa really die?
Like we said,
some buffalo skinners
started to make trouble and...
Well, your father
waded in to stop it...
You make that up
because of Mama?
'Cause she knows.
And so do I.
Know what?
That Mr. Breckenridge
was too gentle to
ever get into a fight.
Maybe that was
the good in him.
BELLE: Bedtime, Melissa.
So early?
It's not early,
it's late.
Goodnight, Mr. O'Malley.
Goodnight, Missy.
Well, I'm ashamed of you,
Stribling.
Poor Breckenridge isn't
even cold yet and already
you're thinking of his widow.
You might be right.
Forget it, cowpoke.
She's mine.
I'd worry about that if
I thought you were gonna
live long enough.
Well, when the time
comes, you'll see.
DANA: Don't count on it.
You'll never
get the chance again
to ruin a woman's life.
You're still talking
about that sister of yours?
You like the truth?
Here it is.
Your sister put more horns
on Jimmy Graham
than a porcupine's got quills.
By the time he
got himself killed,
he wasn't good for
anything except maybe to stuff
and hang over the fireplace.
That sister of yours,
Stribling, was just
a free drink on the house.
And nobody ever
went home thirsty.
I mean nobody.
If you two want to kill
each other, go ahead.
But at least wait
until you cross the border
and fulfill your contract.
If you're not going to
stick with it, get out now.
By the way, O'Malley,
three days after you
killed Jimmy Graham,
my kid sister took
a length of rawhide
and hung herself.
Now what's wrong?
Just pointing the wagon tongue
toward the North star.
Help us get our bearings
in the morning.
If that's such a good idea,
why haven't we done it before,
Mr. Stribling?
Probably because I didn't
need an excuse to talk
to you before.
Oh.
I just want to
tell you not to worry.
I mean to bring that herd
through in good shape,
you can count on me.
Good.
There's one thing more.
If you'll pardon my saying so,
you know, sometimes
it only makes grief worse
when you bottle it up.
Thank you.
If you...
When you're feeling better,
if you need a friend
to talk to about your
plans for the future,
I mean, your plans
and Melissa's,
I'd like to be that friend.
I'll remember that,
Mr. Stribling.
Good night.
Good night.
I didn't know
there were any women
connected with this outfit.
Make any difference?
Not to me,
it don't.
Women like that are worth
$1,500 a piece delivered
to a Dutchman in Veracruz.
That's more than
a whole herd's worth.
You're looking for somebody?
FRANK: Fellow named
Breckenridge.
Hired us to go through
with this outfit to
Crazy Horse, Texas.
We heard he got killed.
So we trailed you
from Tres Santos.
Figured you could really
use some more hands.
We got a paper he signed.
Show him.
Paper doesn't matter.
We need men.
Have you got names?
Sure. Frank Hobbs.
This is my brother Ed,
that fellow over there
calls himself
the Julesburg Kid.
All right.
Let's get to work.
Hey, kid.
You hard of hearing?
All right, we got
a big herd of cows here.
All round here.
Now, bunch them up
so we can move
out of here right away.
Well, now, you ought to
move over there, lady.
Let me handle
them mules for you.
I'll be right with you
just as soon as I tie
my horse on behind here.
You're hard of hearing.
Well, you know, when
I get through with you,
you're gonna like them
cattle so much you'll never
want to leave them.
Come on,
Julesburg Kid,
let's go!
Let's go! That's it!
Hold on! Hold on!
Hold on, there!
Sit on your horse, that's it.
Come here, come here.
Don't be that way.
Come here!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Stay on your horse, there.
Come on, stay on that horse.
That's it!
Now you got it! Come on!
Let's go again, huh? Come on!
On we go! That's it.
Isn't this fun?
Isn't this fun?
Don't you reach
for your gun again.
Now work for your dollar.
Hey, hold it, Missy.
You know a funny thing
about a horse?
He can see a gopher hole
about a mile off, and yet...
Let me show you something.
Look.
And yet he can't
even see a bird's nest
right under his nose.
There's no reason
to be nervous.
I'm going to take you
alive. Remember?
What did he mean?
All he meant was you're
going to have horses scattered
all over the countryside,
unless you get back
to work pronto, miss.
All right.
We may be able to use
a killer on this drive
after all.
I don't think there's
any danger in here.
We better stand watch
around here, just the same.
We'll spread out
among the herd tonight.
Take your bedroll with you.
Get as much sleep as you can.
O'Malley and I
will ride herd.
If I were an Indian,
I could've picked up some
mighty easy scalps just then.
I'm glad you weren't.
Come here. I want to
show you something.
Don't be afraid.
You won't need that
shooting iron. Come on.
Something out there
you could live five lifetimes
and never see again.
Look.
Saint Elmo's fire.
Never seen it
except on ships.
I've never seen it
anywhere. What is it?
Well, a star fell and
smashed and scattered its
glow all over the place.
There, you see?
You laughed.
You're getting
used to me again.
I was really thinking
that you haven't
changed a bit.
How do you mean that?
Oh, you've still got
that wildness on
the tip of your tongue.
I've still got you
in my heart, too.
Look, Belle, I know
this hasn't been
a good trip for you,
but, well, we're going to
have smooth sailing
from here on out.
You really don't want
smooth sailing, Bren.
You carry your own storm
wherever you go.
Only when I travel alone.
Belle.
Look at me.
I'm trying to tell you
how much I love you.
No, Bren.
You loved a 16-year-old girl.
In another country.
In another world almost.
And you still think
I'm that girl.
You are.
I'm not.
The girl you remember died
a long, long time ago.
But the minute
I look at you,
she comes alive again.
Can't you see that,
Belle?
Don't you know what
I've done for you?
Something only
love could do?
I stopped time
from touching you.
I trapped you in my heart
the very first day I saw you,
and I've never let you change.
Oh, Belle, 100 years from now,
my eyes could look at you
and still see
a pretty little girl
in a yellow dress.
You've said it all.
Don't you see, Bren?
I don't want to be
loved as if I were
a frightened, shivering,
innocent little girl.
I have to be loved
for what I am.
I'm a woman
with the heart and the mind
and the flesh of a woman.
I'm not young and
I'm not innocent.
There's so much more to me
to be loved than just that.
But you don't see it.
Because you don't want to.
You're up awful early
this morning.
Why, yes, I am.
Do you think that's wise?
Walking around here unarmed?
Just wanted to see
this little church
in the daylight.
Yeah.
Lots of hopes,
lots of prayers
must've started here.
Or ended.
Babies being christened.
Women burying their dead.
Sometimes men, too.
Men?
I lost my wife
and two daughters
in an Osage war party.
Oh.
I'm sorry.
I'm afraid I was only
thinking of myself.
To me, it's always
seemed like the women
who keep on living.
Men kill or get killed.
And women bury them.
We're professional survivors.
Belle, last night...
I couldn't help seeing
you and O'Malley
talking together.
And I had the feeling
that you two have met
before sometime.
I mean, way before we
began this cattle drive.
Have you?
I don't think you have
the right to ask me that
question, Mr. Stribling.
But I give myself that right,
because I mean to marry you.
That gives me
every right in the world.
Will I have anything to say
about this marriage?
Not until I ask you.
And I can't ask
until I square things
off with him.
Then you'll have
a lot to say about it.
Excuse me.
No reason
to be offended.
But you might just as well
forget you ever saw him,
because I'm the man
you're going to marry.
I mean what I say, Belle.
O'Malley!
Hold up the herd!
What did you think
you were doing?
I was protecting
my fifth of the herd.
You get on back there
and get the outfit ready
to stand off an attack.
I didn't sign up
to fight Yaquis.
Well, I ain't about
to fight them, either.
Get the wagon and the remuda
over here and we'll surround
them with the herd.
Get ready.
Hold it.
MILTON: They've got Stribling.
All they wanted was
a little fresh beef.
You could've
got him killed.
Not yet.
How many herd
did you have to give?
One-fifth of the herd!
O'Malley's fifth.
Never did like cows
much anyhow.
Quicksand!
Watch where you ride!
Throw me a rope.
Let's have a rope.
Think you might find a way
to tear up that warrant?
Not a chance.
Hold your hands
over your head.
The big guy is stuck
in the quicksand.
Don't get the wrong idea,
Stribling.
If Belle didn't need you
to get these cattle through,
you'd be on the bottom now,
alongside your horse.
That's the way I figured.
I killed Frank Hobbs.
MILTON: Well, there she is.
We made it.
Sure is beautiful.
I got plenty of
to help us make the crossing.
Crazy Horse is
on the other side,
just beyond that ridge.
BELLE: When do we cross over?
First thing in the morning.
MISSY: You mean we're going to
have to make camp again?
When there's a town
in plain sight?
DANA: Well, it's too late
to try today, Melissa.
All right, let's get
these cattle moving
towards the river.
You know, Missy,
you and your mother
could make the crossing now,
and spend
a comfortable night in town.
I'd like that.
We've come this far, Melissa.
We might as well spend
one more night.
Well, I sure would
like a nice bath.
You know, this is our
last night in Mexico.
Let's celebrate.
Let's have a fiesta.
A fiesta? Can we get
all dressed up?
Why not?
O'Malley? O'Malley?
O'MALLEY: Yes?
We're going to have
a fiesta tonight. Will
you dance with me?
Sure will. Dance with
you all night long.
Oh, Mr. O'Malley,
if you decide not to
cross the border with us,
I'll be glad to send
your wages after
I've sold the herd.
I'll think about it.
I'm only a sham.
I haven't any slippers.
I wouldn't wear boots.
Do you like it?
Very much.
It was my mother's.
Could've been
made for you.
Melissa, where did
you find that dress?
In your trunk.
It's been torn.
Oh, yes, it is.
Did you know that, Mama?
Yes. Someone gave me
a corsage of primroses.
And a very jealous boy
ripped them off and stomped
on them. Tore the dress.
I think that's romantic.
Well, some day I'll give
those primroses back to you.
Dance with me.
Your watch, O'Malley.
Hey. You're a long ways
from your wagon.
What are you doing here?
Are you going to
cross over?
I don't know.
I haven't decided yet.
If you stay here in Mexico,
I'm staying here with you.
Why do you say
a thing like that?
Because I love you.
Oh, Missy, you
only think you do.
And you mustn't...
Don't say that I mustn't.
I've loved you from
the very first minute
I saw you.
And now I'm all filled up
with love for you.
Have you said
anything like this
to your mother?
No. Not yet.
Besides...
Besides what?
You've seen the way
she looks at Mr. Stribling.
She won't be lonely
for me for much longer.
Missy.
Look at me.
And listen to me.
Now you're young,
too young...
I'm not.
Girls here marry when they're
much younger than I am.
In Mexico, I'm a woman.
Why is it you always
make such a ruckus
over being a woman?
Because it's important.
I can sew, keep house
and cook better than any
woman you ever knew.
Of course you can.
And one these days,
a boy'll come along...
I don't want a boy.
I want you.
You want someone
who'll fill your heart
with warmth and sunlight.
You want a young man,
not me.
All I can do is throw
a cloud over you...
I'm not afraid of clouds.
I'm not afraid of anything.
If you can see so much
beauty just by looking
into the ocean waves,
why can't you see
just a little something
to love in me?
Oh, Missy, I do.
I do, Missy.
I look at you and
all I see is loveliness.
Please try to get
used to me.
And if you don't
love me right now,
please try to learn.
Oh, Missy.
I've loved you
all my life.
Take me with you
wherever you go?
For as long as you want,
thanking God every step
of the way that I found you.
There's Texas.
It's a lovely sight.
Hey, do we cross the border
in the middle of the river
or when we get
to the other side?
Well, I don't know.
Well, you like
everything legal,
don't you?
Oh, yeah.
You still want to
serve that warrant?
That's right.
I'm not accepting it,
you know.
That's what I figured.
What's that do
to our showdown?
Maybe we ought to get
the work done first.
Gives us one more hand.
I'll come for you at sundown.
I'll be waiting for you.
Ho, there. Come on.
I'll meet you back here
as soon as I get cleaned up.
I'll be waiting!
You could stop this thing
if you didn't hate him so.
I don't hate him.
I did, at first.
It's hard to keep on
hating somebody
you've come to know.
Then let him go.
Forget about him.
I was almost hoping
he wouldn't cross over.
Please.
Sorry, Belle.
Belle.
What is O'Malley to you?
Or what was he?
I knew him years ago,
when I was a girl.
I haven't seen him since.
Until he came to the ranch.
Were you in love with him?
I thought I was.
I was afraid of that.
You can't think
there's anything now?
No, Belle.
I'll meet you
back here for supper.
Oh, Dana.
Please. If you really love me,
you won't gamble your
life away like this.
Remember,
it's my life, too.
Belle, I do
really love you.
Oh, then don't fight him.
There must be
a way out. Find it.
Oh, promise me you will.
Good afternoon,
Mrs. Breckenridge.
You look beautiful.
I had to see you, Bren.
I have to talk to you.
All right. Let's talk.
I want to thank you
for all you've done
for me and Melissa.
That's all right.
But don't you think you
should get out of the country,
before something happens?
What could happen?
Well, if you
stay here, you'll...
Either you'll have another
murder on your hands,
or you'll be killed.
You're not thinking
about me. You're
worried about Stribling.
You love him. You don't
want to see him killed.
That's fair enough.
I'm not thinking
of Stribling.
You're a real woman,
Belle.
Sorry that cowpoke
won't live long enough
to know what he's got.
It's not Stribling.
It's Melissa.
She told me.
I can't let you
take her, Bren.
I won't.
Look, Belle.
Missy'll be safe with me.
Nothing bad will ever happen
to her while I'm with her.
I promise that.
But it won't last, Bren.
She's so young, it can't.
It will.
You see, Missy and I
need each other. I don't
know how it happened,
but she loves me in a way
she'll never love
any other man.
You don't know
what you're saying.
But I do. I want Missy.
And she belongs to me.
I love her more than
I love my own life.
Don't you know why?
Bren, you must.
She's your daughter.
It's true.
You know it's true.
What're you trying
to do to me, Belle?
Do you think
I wouldn't know
my own daughter?
Even if I never
saw her before,
I'd know my daughter.
The minute I looked
at her, I'd feel it.
You're lying.
What a dirty thing to do.
You're lying. You're lying.
You're lying.
O'Malley.
O'Malley.
Missy.
O'Malley?
What's wrong?
Oh, nothing.
I was just thinking
what a beautiful girl
you've turned out to be.
Beautiful, beautiful girl.
Missy, let's take a walk.
Wonderful.
Got my things all packed.
Good.
Are you going to have
to fight Mr. Stribling?
We decided on tomorrow,
but we leave today.
You know, I feel as if
I've been looking for you
all my life.
Without knowing who you were
or even what you looked like.
Then I found you.
And now,
I'll have you forever.
Forever?
Mmm-hmm.
You know something, Missy?
I'm old enough
to be your father.
What difference
does that make?
Well, it means
that some day,
you'll be alone.
I won't be with
you anymore,
and so you'll have to find
someone else to love.
That's silly.
I couldn't love anybody
else but you. I couldn't.
There's something
wrong with us, Missy.
But why?
Because if you ever
really love, you have
to go on loving.
It's like a mountain spring.
If it stops flowing,
there's no more spring.
And if you stop loving,
just because
something happens to me,
there's no more Missy.
You mean, you'd want me
to find somebody else?
If you really loved me,
you'd have to find
someone else.
And the day you found him,
and gave him all the love
you once gave me...
Oh, Missy, Missy.
On that day,
all the angels in heaven
will shout for joy.
And the stars will bend low
to chime your wedding bells.
And I'll hear them.
And I'll smile.
And then I'll
go to sleep again,
content.
Missy?
Are you all through?
I'm not sure.
Because I'm
not listening.
Already I'm a bore.
No.
It's time to get
our horses.
I'll pick up your
saddlebags at the hotel.
You wait for me
right here.
You'll come right back
to me, won't you?
When that sun
goes down over there,
just below
the rim of the hills,
I'll come
right back to you.
O'Malley!
It wasn't even loaded.
He told me to give you this,
in case anything happened.
Primroses.
You said you'd
give them to me.
