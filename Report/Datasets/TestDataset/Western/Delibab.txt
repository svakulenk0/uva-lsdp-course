To my father, in the heavenly stables
Far away from the capital city,
country life has perished.
Criminal gangs occupy abandoned farms,
bringing back slavery.

MIRAGE
I want to go to the tavern.
You'll have to wait a bit.
Good morning!
Thank you very much!
Mister, wake up!
Radio Kossuth, Budapest.
The current time is noon.
This is it.
We'll have to bury him.
It's hot...
There's another spade in there!
Open the door!
Come out with your hands up!
Stop there!
Close the door!
Turn around and face the wall!
Frisk him.
Open the bag.
Hands up and turn back to the wall!
Do you speak Hungarian?
A bit.
Turn around!
Hands!
Wait!
What's going on?
What have you caught?
He just arrived on the train.
Aha... and what's the problem?
He's on the run for taking bribes
and match-fixing. Do you know him?
Come here.
Who?
You.
Me?
I'm not talking to myself!
Come on.
Come on.
You stay there!
Let me tell you how we'll do.
Give him the key.
We know you come tomorrow!
But Cisco: "No, no he comes today!"
"He comes today!“
He was right.
Cisco...
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Do you understand me?
I understand you.
Me Kokas.
- Francis.
- What?
Francis!
Hello, Francis.
Football player?
I'm sure you can fucking hear me!
Why not...
Why not West?
Big team.
Or America like Beckham.
Drogba is better.
Do you know Hagi?
Steaua.
Steaua Bucuresti! Steaua...
Number one!
Striker, jersey number ten.
Is it far?
No, no. It's close.
The farm... close.
But...
...you can't see because...
It's the fucking Puszta!
Treacherous country this...
It looks ﬂat, but there are potholes so big
you could hide a tank in them!
French is the official language
in the Ivory Coast, isn't it?
Yes, why?
Sunglasses off!
And you.
I see you like it here.
Things could be worse...
But then they'd be much worse.
Who said you could leave the vehicle?
Nobody said I couldn't.
Can we take a look in your bag?
Hands up!
Don't drink from the well, ifs not drinkable.
Bad, bad water!
This is the shower, that's how you say
it in French, right?
Shower gel.
There's...
Don't go there!
Good water inside.
Good water, you can drink this.
Don't drink from the well.
Here, cold water.
And cola no... It's Cisco's cola!
Meat, all you want.
Cigarettes... free.
Come on!
Thank you.
So, this is it...
...and tomorrow
either you bore or you work.
Hammer!
Please, show me a bed.
Fuck off!
Ready?
Didn't you have anything colder?
Come on!
It is cold.
Everyone stay where you are!
Get your ID papers ready!
Have a look around!
Give it here! Give me the gun!
To the wall! Come on!
You don't have to work so hard.
There's no need to rush.
It's enough to do it
when they're watching.
If they see you can chop this much in one day,
they'll have us all doing it tomorrow.
Understand?
I'm asking you for us all
not to fuck things up for us!
"This farm used to belong to my family.
These men just came and took over.
Make them leave.
Make them disappear from the..."
...surface.
What the fuck are you doing in here?!
What are you doing here? Get out!
Hurry up! Move 'rt!
Get out!
Get up!
Move, move!
Faster!
Faster, you dogs!
Go to fucking work!
I heard a knocking noise.
Is it the half shaft?
I hope not...
These fucking plains have damaged the truck
more than any other roads we've been on!
Going somewhere, are we?
You forgot to give my papers back.
I didn't forget.
I must have misunderstood something then.
That's more than likely.
I want to go back. I've changed my mind.
Okay.
We'll take you back when they says so.
Until then, you're not going anywhere.
Don't even think about escaping.
You'll never find your way out of here,
not unless you've got wings.
One of us isn't normal.
That's possible.
Did you see anything?
Did you see anything?
No, I don't think so.
Go away! Get the hell out of here!
Go away! Get the hell out of here!
Fuck off!
We also have a monkey!
We also have a monkey!
Come on, come on for God's sake.
Take him!
Go clean the stables,
the shit is up to your knees.
Where's the ball?
Hey, you're here at last.
Have a good rest?
Where's my ball?
What ball?
What the fuck happened?
He attacked the geese.
- Jackal?
- Yes.
Did you shoot it?
Maybe they are more.
You really don't feel it?
How can you exist here?
You don't feel it?
How can you sleep in here?
There's no air!
Open the door.
My head's splitting.
Bring me some tablets.
Didn't I tell you not to wander around
in your panties?
- There's nobody here...
- I'm here.
I told you!
What's this?
Thanks.
Stand up!
Are you deaf?
Stand up!
Stand up!
What the fuck's wrong with you?
Stand up and get back to fucking work!
Do you want me to get off the horse?
I told you to go back to fucking work,
so why don't you stand up?
What's wrong with you?
Hurry up, snowball! Get them moving!
Do you hear me?
What the fuck are you doing, Tomi?!
Go after the geese!
Hurry up! I don't want to see
any feathers here in half an hour!
You stay here!
What did he do?
He hit somebody with a car.
So what? And?
I think he killed him.
Oh dear!
What's his job?
Taxi driver.
Okay.
Then take care of him.
You know what you have to do.
Sure, boss.
Hey, ...
The keys.
Cool shirt!
Your shirt, ifs cool!
Go fuck yourself!
There was a ball in the wardrobe.
You haven't seen it, have you?
What ball?
A football.
It was at the bottom, covered with a towel.
Covered?
- Did you see it?
- No.
- What were you doing in the bathroom?
- When?
Last night!
What was that screwdriver doing in the toilet?
I don't know.
- And then?
- What?
Where's the ball?
- I told you I don't know.
- No?
- No.
- Are you sure?
Yes.
Where did you two put the ball?
Where did you two put the ball?
- Who?
- You know who!
Where's the ball?
Oh, baby. Please, stop it.
Okay.
Stinking fucking animal!
Fuck it!
Give me the honey.
I'll give you some time to think about it, okay?
Just call if you remember!
So what happened?
Do you remember now?
What are we gonna do?
I told you, I don't know.
Where did you put it?
Tell me, I'm getting angry...
Where did you put the ball?
Don't you understand?
- Answer me.
- I don't know what you're talking about.
You don't know what I am talking about'?!
The cow's pregnant.
You need to come for a minute.
I don't know,maybe there is somebody
in the car too.
I don't know.
