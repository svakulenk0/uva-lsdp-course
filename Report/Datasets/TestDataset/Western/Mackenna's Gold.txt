There's an old story.
The way the Apaches tell it...
...a man was riding in the desert
and came across a vulture...
...the kind they call turkey buzzards
in Arizona, sittin' on a rock.
"Hey," the man says, "how come you
old turkey buzzard's sittin' here?
"I saw you flying over Hadleyberg,
and I didn't want to meet up with you...
"...so I turned around and come this way."
Old turkey buzzard says:
"That's funny,
I was only passing through that town.
"I was really coming over here
to wait foryou."
A thousand years ago, in the Southwest,
there was an Apache legend.
It told about a hidden canyon, guarded
by the Apache gods and rich with gold.
As long as the Apaches kept the canyon
a secret and never touched the gold...
...they would be strong, powerful.
That was the legend.
When the Spanish Conquistadores came,
they searched for that canyon.
They called it "Caòón Del Oro,"
meaning Canyon of Gold.
But they never found it.
Three hundred years later,
the Americans came.
They heard about the legend, but they
called the canyon, "The Lost Adams."
That was because a man named Adams
saw it once, or so he said.
But whether he did or not,
he never saw anythin' again...
...because the Apaches
burned out his eyes.
Everybody knew about that legend
and a lot of people believed it.
Caòón Del Oro. The Lost Adams.
And then for a while there, back in 1874,
they called it, "Mackenna's Gold."
Take it easy, old man.
You're not healthy enough to play games.
I know you. You are Mackenna.
-The marshal.
-That's right, but I don't know you.
Why'd you try to bushwhack me?
Somebody pay you?
-Colorado?
-No pay. Nobody pay.
-Well, then, why?
-Because you look for gold.
You ought to be ashamed of yourself,
an old man like you...
...going around shooting at prospectors.
Keep that up, you're gonna get in trouble.
Besides, if you know me, you know
I quit gold huntin' a long time ago.
The only dust I ever found was prairie dust.
Never got rich but I sure got thirsty.
But now you look for the gold again.
-Everybody look for the gold.
-What gold?
What gold?
I know this place. That's Shaking Rock.
No gold around there.
I've been there.
Why you stay with me?
Why you not kill me?
Well, that's what I oughta do.
Tell you what, you give me your word
you won't go around...
...pickin' off people anymore,
and I'll take you home.
No home.
Well, I'll get you to a doctor, anyway.
I die here.
Now you have the gold.
But you will wish you never see this map.
The spirits will kill you. No laugh.
It is a secret place.
So that's what it's supposed to be.
Caòón Del Oro, The Lost Adams.
Don't worry, old man,
I won't go looking for it.
Wasted three good years chasing that
wild goose. There is no Lost Adams.
It is bad time.
Young warriors want gold...
...like white men.
It is good time for old man to die.
Plenty of time for that, old man.
Don't rush it.
Feel like eating something?
Old man?
Old man.
I wish you hadn't shot at me.
I thought maybe you were someone else.
Soldiers. Many soldiers.
Sir, you have been most kind
and we are grateful.
We ask no more of your hospitality
than the loan of a few horses and mules...
...which we need,
and some food for our journey.
Also, we will take your wife...
...because if we run into trouble
with the Cavalry she may come in useful.
If we pass this way again, God willing,
I will sell her back to you.
That is a true promise.
Take a rest, Marshal.
We will finish the old man's grave.
We'll make it a little longer, a little wider...
...and then maybe we will
bury you together.
God is good to me.
You remember?
I told you I would come for you, old friend.
You'll never get back, old friend.
I will find a way.
Put that shovel down
and come and talk to Colorado.
Don't move, Mackenna,
or I'll cut you in half.
Now come out like a gentlemen.
You know, we've been trailing
that old man for two weeks now.
-Where's the map?
-Map? What map?
I know this fellow.
He's a good card player.
He always remembers the cards.
If he saw the map, he remembers it.
So we have a map in his head.
I told you.
I told you nobody runs me out.
And now I have you,
and you will take us to the gold.
And then I will kill you.
Hurry up, Besh.
Cover him with some rocks and let's go.
No. He is a chief.
He was going to Caòón Del Oro.
We bury him there.
Are you crazy?
You know how bad he's going to stink
by the time we get there?
Of course. He's a chief.
He must be buried there.
I should have thought of it myself.
Besh, come on.
In the old days, before Mackenna ran him
out of the territory...
...Colorado had a hideout
in a little box canyon.
Now that he was back,
he was using it again.
And that's where he took Mackenna,
his living map.
You're crazy to come back.
You know Judge Bergerman
put a price on your head.
You know, that's funny. I never lay eyes
on that Judge Bergerman.
But he don't like me.
Well, someday me and him will meet.
And I will take his head, in a basket.
Anyway, I came back
after that map you burned up.
Why? You can buy a dozen
just like it for a dollar a piece.
Not like that map. Not like the map
old Prairie Dog was carrying.
Well, that old man wasn't Prairie Dog.
Prairie Dog is dead.
He sure is now.
The whole thing is a fairy tale.
There's no Caòón Del Oro.
Old Adams was never there.
Then why did you kill
Prairie Dog and take his map?
-That's not the way it happened.
-I know how it happened.
You just got tired of working
for $20 a month...
...so you took advantage
of that poor old man.
You bushwhacked him,
gunned him down, and took his map.
I'm surprised at you. A marshal.
-Hesh-ke remembers you.
-I remember her, too.
Hesh-ke.
What I can't figure out is how you knew
about this map. It's the only real one.
It was supposed to be
only in Prairie Dog's head.
He was supposed to pass it on
before he died.
Then somebody found out
there really was a map.
And two weeks ago,
the old man up and left the tribe.
Well, why didn't he pass it on?
I guess he didn't know who he could trust.
See, the Apache have changed.
They're beginning to think
like white men now.
Some of the young think they got more use
for that gold than those old spirits.
There isn't any gold.
And if there was,
it would belong to the whole tribe.
You're wrong.
That gold belongs to the spirits,
and they said I can have it.
Listen, old friend, I know you.
You're just like an Apache: very stubborn.
These other friends of mine here,
they are stubborn, too.
Why don't you just take us there
and we'll be partners?
-There's enough for all of us.
-I've been there.
There's not enough gold there
to fill your back tooth.
-You've been in the canyon?
-There's no canyon.
You don't know.
Listen, you like to gamble.
Let's take a chance.
Suppose we lose?
Well, then we split up
and you go wherever you want.
How? On foot with my hands tied
behind my back?
No. I'll give you anything you need.
Water, horses, your guns.
-When?
-When what?
The guns?
When you take us there.
I mean, you gotta prove yourself, no?
I'll tell you what else I'll give you.
I will give you the girl.
-What girl?
-The one you've been looking at.
I tell you the truth. Her husband's rich.
-You will get a big reward.
-No!
Monkey, what do we want?
We want the gold. Why?
Because when we get the gold,
we can buy all the women we want.
Besides, if Laguna don't show up
tomorrow, it's an extra share for all of us.
No.
You want the Scar-face? Take her.
Take the little fat one.
Take the old woman.
You can have lots of fun.
What do you say, we shake on it?
All right.
I'll take you there.
And the gold is all yours.
I'll take you there and then I go,
like you said.
No gold?
Why?
You like Hadleyberg so much?
They don't like you. That's what I hear.
I'll tell you the truth. I'm superstitious.
I don't want to tangle
with those Indian spirits.
-Okay. You're crazy, but okay.
-And another thing.
You tell your little boy there
I want all my stuff back.
Sure. I keep everything safe
for you until you go.
But there's no gold and there's no canyon.
I make the jokes, compadre.
Hesh-ke.
You're lucky.
Looks like she ain't holding no grudge.
She was mad. I think she still likes you.
Too bad I already gave her to Monkey.
You want to change your mind?
Sleep well, old friend.
Miss.
You know me. I'm Mackenna, the marshal.
I'm not going to hurt you.
You know me.
It was your father who made me marshal.
They killed my father.
They killed my father.
Don't tell any of them, nobody,
that you're Judge Bergerman's daughter.
If Colorado finds that out, you'll be
in worse trouble than you are now.
You understand?
You hear me?
Yes, I remember you.
You came out to the ranch once for supper.
That's right. I was once.
They say you like to play cards.
Well, yes, I enjoy an unfriendly game
of poker from time to time.
Off-duty, of course.
I take a drink now and then, too.
My father didn't hold with gambling
and neither do I.
Well, I know, Miss. I know that.
I'm trying to mend my ways. Seriously.
It doesn't look right for a marshal
to be playing cards. I know that.
Now you rest.
Try to sleep.
And remember what I told you.
We start early tomorrow.
Go get some sleep.
You see, I keep my end of the deal,
old friend. You keep yours.
Better put your belt on.
You could lose your pants.
-Okay, come on.
-Ain't we gonna wait for Laguna?
Naw. He likes that girl in Hadleyberg
so much, let him get rich with her.
Man comes with flag.
Hesh-ke, take the girl inside.
I don't think they're looking for you,
Marshal.
But if they are, I would like to kill you.
I don't know how I'd get you
to that canyon if you did.
You could with a broken kneecap.
Painful, but possible.
If you want to collect the reward on that
girl, remember that Hesh-ke has a knife.
Colorado!
John Colorado!
Ben!
Ben Baker! Ben!
-My old friend!
-No!
Stay where you are, Colorado.
Who's that with you?
Why, Marshal. You and Colorado together.
Well, well, well.
-Surprised?
-No.
Some of the people with me might be,
but not me.
Not with a stake like this one.
No, this is no time for holding old grudges.
Speaking for myself, I'm glad you're here.
We can play some poker.
Not with your cards.
Welcome back, Colorado.
And there's enough for all of us.
-Enough?
-We know all about it.
We know you've been looking
for Prairie Dog.
We know you got the word from Besh
and Little Hatchet here.
How? And how'd you know we were here?
Nobody but us knows about this place.
Laguna.
Sorry, Colorado.
You know me.
-I drink too much, then I talk too much.
-Yeah.
Then they had me.
You see, didn't I say
Laguna shouldn't go into Hadleyberg?
Colorado, it's a big desert.
It's going to take a lot of eyes
to find that old man.
And after that,
it's going to be a long way to the canyon.
There's cavalry out after you.
More than you've ever seen.
And a lot of bronco Apaches on the prowl,
after anybody and everybody.
Probably after the gold, too.
You don't know what's going on out there.
You need us.
One more thing.
You got yourself a mighty fine place here,
but it's a box canyon.
One way in, same way out.
We could camp outside
until you get awful hungry.
Well, there's a lot in what you say.
Of course, if the soldiers catch us together,
you will hang together with me.
If Mackenna's gonna
take a chance with you...
...that's good enough for me.
Well, what do you think, Mackenna?
I'm glad he's here.
Like he says,
we can play some poker along the way.
Besh, with respect, move the chief.
It is true that there's enough for all of us.
But it is also true
that it's a long way to the canyon.
It's a deal.
Come up and have some breakfast.
Hold it!
He double-crossed me.
You all knew I'd kill him
the first chance I got.
Anyway, there's enough for all of us,
only now there'll be a little bit more.
Okay.
Only no more killing,
or there sure will be a lot of it.
You know, Ben, we've got a deal, but...
...I wish I could have seen
all your friends before we made it.
What's wrong with them?
These two, I don't know what they are.
And I'm afraid to guess.
We were just passing through Hadleyberg...
...and I'm afraid we overheard
a most interesting conversation.
Mr. Baker was kind enough
to allow us to join the group.
He promised this to be good sport.
And profitable, too.
Is that so?
Is that so?
Colorado.
Yeah. "Good sport."
I know this fellow.
You're the storekeeper from Hadleyberg.
Does your wife know where you are?
I don't know this one,
but he looks pale, too.
What are you? A dentist?
No. He's the editor
of the Hadleyberg Gazette.
-This one looks like a preacher.
-I preach.
-Yeah? What you preach, gold?
-The Word of God.
Yeah, but you like gold, right?
It can work for the Lord
as well as the devil.
Why should only
the Church of Rome have gold?
Gold, silver, idols and corruption.
When I get my gold....
-Your gold?
-...my share.
My share will build
a tabernacle to the Lord.
A temple of the true Gospel,
a whole string of 'em through the territory.
Ben, to bring this fella,
you gotta be crazier than he is.
I told you, everybody knows.
You can't keep gold a secret.
It travels in the air.
Anyway, we can use every gun we can get,
no matter who carries it.
Mackenna.
Preacher, this isn't going to be
like a walk to church on Sunday.
You might get yourself killed.
Might have to do some killing yourself.
The Lord knows
what he wants his servants to do.
Anyway, that gold belongs to the Apache.
It can be used for them,
to bring 'em to the Lord.
Ay, Chihuahual
He makes a good deal with his Lord.
Now we come to the last and the best.
A blind man and a kid.
I see good enough for both of us.
That old man has a better right
to be here than we have.
Don't you know him?
That's Adams himself.
Adams?
That's Adams.
-You see? That's Adams.
-I see Adams.
-I don't see any gold.
-There's gold there.
More gold than you ever saw.
All the gold in the world.
Yeah, tell him. Tell him the story.
No. It's been told too many times.
But we're gonna take you back there.
Go on, Mr. Adams.
-Tell us.
-No.
Well, it was the Mexican
that took us there...
...the one who was brought up
by the Apaches.
He didn't want no gold for himself.
He was afraid.
Kept talking about the old Apache spirits.
All he wanted was a string of horses.
So we gave it to him.
The way he took us there...
...twisting and turning,
and mostly by night.
We never knew where we were.
And at the last,
he made us put on blindfolds.
When we took 'em off...
...there it was...
...the prettiest little valley you ever saw.
Sparkling and shining in the sun.
It was just like a dream.
Indians used to live there 1,000 years ago,
maybe even more.
And gold everywhere!
The canyon wall had streaks...
...five yards, ten yards wide.
On the canyon floor, there were nuggets
laying all over the ground. Pure gold.
Gold dust in every clump of brush.
You couldn't put a pan in the river
without showing colour.
Well, the first day we filled
a great big coffee pot with just nuggets.
No one could lift it.
Well, we built a shack.
Went to work.
Next thing, the Apaches were there.
They killed everyone, except me.
Then they fixed my eyes,
and left me in the desert.
I wasn't any older than this lad here.
Tell 'em about the nugget.
Well, when I got found...
...I still had one little nugget
in my pocket. Just a little one.
$190 it was worth.
Just a little one.
You know something? You're pretty.
I don't know if you are a boy or a girl.
If you are a boy,
I'm going to give you a haircut.
If you are a girl, I am going to kiss you.
I think you are a girl.
That's Hachita.
Soldiers!
Now who's going to do it,
your men or mine?
-Yours. You have more to spare.
-We'll cut for it.
Okay. But I shuffle.
When we move out...
...you gentlemen head
straight for the Cavalry.
Tell them about Colorado.
You tell 'em I'm his prisoner.
What? I don't understand.
How could you be his prisoner?
-You trying to get rid of us?
-I'm trying to save your lives.
Forget about the gold, Mr. Weaver,
there isn't any.
-Get back to your store.
-I don't believe you. You're lying!
You know better. Get out.
A man like you has no business here.
There's good use for gold.
Do a lot for the territory.
-Forget about it. Do what I tell you.
-No.
These men have gold fever.
Get out of this. Get to the Cavalry.
Mackenna.
-What is he telling you?
-The truth. I told them to go home.
Why are you so selfish?
You can't keep it all for yourself.
Did he tell you that he killed Prairie Dog?
He burned the map,
but he knows where the canyon is.
-That's the truth.
-Well, now, that's more like it.
I never trusted you, Mackenna.
I knew it was a mistake to let the judge
talk us into making you a marshal.
A man from nowhere. A drifter.
You never were one of us.
-I cleaned up your town.
-Where's your badge now?
Marshal, did you really kill that old man?
Sure, but it was self-defence.
You're a murderer!
It's been a nice, quick trial.
When's the hanging?
What's all this talk of hanging?
We're all friends here. All partners.
Inga! What are you doing here?
Why is she here?
I will tell you.
I will tell you the whole truth.
On our way to meet Mackenna,
when he sent for us...
...we ran out of food,
so we stopped at a little ranch.
We expected to pay, but the man...
...he starts to shoot.
So we beg, "Please, stop!"
He's crazy. He won't listen.
So we thought the best thing to do,
make her a partner, give her a full share.
Your father's dead?
But what can we do now? Nothing.
We'll never get another chance like this.
-You mean it was an accident?
-I swear it.
I, myself, said a prayer over his grave.
Well, we can't bring him back now,
that's for sure. Right, Fuller?
No, we can't.
Right, storekeeper?
I don't know. I don't know what to think.
This isn't what I expected.
I didn't think it would be like this.
I don't know what to do.
You can get out of this, all of you,
before it's too late.
Gentlemen, forgive me, I'm a stranger here
so I haven't followed a good deal of this...
...but I do feel it would be a terrible pity
if we fell out among ourselves...
...or if we abandoned
what we all set out to accomplish.
I mean, we're embarked
on a great adventure, gentlemen.
Something that comes
only once in a lifetime.
So, I propose that we forget the past,
whatever may have occurred...
...and all go forward.
He's right!
Why else do you think the good God
brings us all together like this?
It's true, Padrecito?
I have nothing to say to you.
The Lord has his own ways
and I have my own reasons for being here.
So we agree,
Mackenna takes us to the canyon.
Sure, we agree.
We all agree to get rich.
We're all going to be millionaires.
Every one of you.
That's what you think,
and nothing else matters.
The best man your town had
has been murdered.
And all you can say is,
"Well, we can't bring him back."
Not much of an epitaph, is it?
It's all you've got time for.
You can't see, you can't hear, you don't
want to know anything but that gold.
You're sick with it, all of you.
I started out being his prisoner
and now I've got you all on my back.
There's no gold, no canyon.
There's nothing.
It's just a story that this old man tells
to get himself free drinks.
I'll take you there. I got no choice.
But I'll tell you this,
not many of you will be coming back.
There is gold.
I saw it. All the gold in the world.
Come on. We're wasting time.
You know, I'm beginning not to trust you.
I trust you.
My God, after all these years, don't you
know you mount a horse on the left side?
They figured they had only one chance
of gettin' past the Cavalry...
...and they had a plan.
They'd gotten the squaw
so drunk she couldn't talk.
And two of Baker's men
were gonna ride her right into the camp...
...making out they were being chased
by Apaches.
And while Hachita, Besh,
and Monkey were carryin' on...
...as though they were
a whole raidin' party...
...all the rest were gonna
take off a different way.
If it all went well, they'd meet up later.
That was the plan.
And with a little bit of luck,
It just could work.
What's going on?
I can't tell, sir.
Don't shoot!
It's a squaw.
Tied to the horse!
Easy. Easy.
Where's the sergeant?
Get out of the way.
All right, let go.
What the hell's going on here, Sergeant?
Pie-eyed, sir.
I'll get some black coffee into her.
Maybe we'll make some sense out of this.
All right, the party's over.
Get back to your posts, all of you.
Do you hear me? Move!
So now they were all together.
The good citizens and the outlaws...
...and Mackenna and the girl.
They made for the waterhole
at the old Brogan ranch...
...because it was the last chance
to fill up before they hit the desert.
The Apaches had burnt out the old
Brogan place about five years before.
Nobody ever took it over
because it was too far out.
But everybody knew about
the waterhole, and everybody used it.
It was kind of neutral territory.
It's the Cavalry!
We're surrounded. It's the Cavalry!
I'm Judge Fuller!
You're making a mistake.
I'm Judge Fuller!
I'm editor of the Gazette!
I've captured Colorado!
Don't shoot! I've captured Colorado!
Don't shoot!
I've got old man Adams here.
Don't shoot, please!
Riding in this country without a gun?
Very reckless.
I knew we could depend on you.
Miss?
Leave her alone.
I mean leave her.
No. We're back to the way things were.
You gave her to me, don't you remember?
We're short of water
and she's slowing us up.
So leave her.
-Get out of the way.
-No.
I'm not much good to you dead.
Has it crossed your mind that
you'll never see that canyon if you kill me?
I won't kill you, but I'll hurt you awful bad.
So get out of the way.
There's plenty of water.
Less than two hours from here.
Are you crazy?
Just keep your eye on the dealer.
You're good.
You're really good.
-For this I give you Monkey's share.
-Yeah.
Come on, enjoy!
Mr. Mackenna, I want to thank you...
...for everything.
That's all right.
Your father and I never had
much to say to each other...
...but he was a good man.
That's lucky for me.
Excuse me, but is there something
between you and that Indian girl?
No.
There was a long time ago.
Then after I got the marshal's job,
I had to go out and collect her brother.
Then he got himself hanged.
Don't make her mad. She's kind of crazy.
Why aren't you married?
I guess I never found a man
who could hold a candle to my father.
I guess not.
Hey, what's the matter with you?
You like to be dirty?
Show you a new way
to get your clothes clean.
I'll never understand the gringo, never.
It's all your fault.
You know Hesh-ke.
You know she has a terrible temper.
I'm sorry. If Hesh-ke's got her mind
made up to kill that girl, she'll do it.
You gave her to me
and I don't want her damaged.
I can't watch her every minute.
What's the matter with you?
We've got enough partners now.
Besides, this will keep those Apache
happy for awhile.
Some scout.
The man leading that Cavalry patrol
was Sergeant Tibbs.
"Foxy" Tibbs his men called him.
He knew his way around.
Old "Foxy" Tibbs and his eight men
just kept followin' on.
At the end of the first day,
he sent two men back to the company...
...so they could show
the lieutenant the trail.
And every day after, he kept sending
two more men back, in kind of a relay.
And he hung on their heels, fast or slow.
Finally, it was five against five.
You two in the back, get going.
Good.
Now we can double back
and take them one by one.
Yeah, that's good.
When they see us comin',
they can turn around...
...and lead us right back into the arms
of the whole company two by two.
Of course, they won't hang me.
Now I'll tell you what you can do.
Send the girl back to the troopers.
-Why?
-Well, for one thing, she holds us up.
They wouldn't be able to keep up with us
if they had her on their hands.
No.
All right.
You've probably got a better idea.
No. I have no better idea.
-Only this one better work.
-It'll work.
-I'll tell her.
-Sure, you tell her.
-I can tell her.
-I know.
Miss.
You're free to go over there and
join the soldiers. They'll get you home.
It wouldn't be fair
to leave you here all alone.
He's not alone. He's got me.
I think I should stay, Mr. Mackenna.
Look, lady,
you'd better go before I change my mind.
I'll come by for supper
some night when I get back.
Now git!
Stay here. And keep your eyes open.
Well, that gets rid of her, anyway.
You've had a hard time, Miss Bergerman.
You have my sympathy.
Thank you. Sergeant, you will be able
to do something about Mr. Mackenna?
Yes, I think I can.
Now there were only four of them left.
That made the odds a little better
for Mackenna.
Only thing was Hesh-ke had ideas.
She wanted Mackenna back now.
And now the girl was gone,
she figured there was nothin' to stop her.
Thanks.
Mackenna, don't make her mad.
Colorado, someone comes.
Stop! Now!
Take it easy. I'm coming in.
Take it slow.
Stay where you are.
I've come to join up.
I hope there won't be any trouble about it.
-You expect us to believe that?
-Don't!
He's a murderer.
He killed two men, his own men.
That's right.
That's right.
That means I have two extra horses.
Good horses. They'll come in
real handy when we find the gold.
Oh, yes, the little lady here
told me all about it.
Of course, I already had
a pretty good idea from the squaw.
All right. But you're a foolish man.
Suppose we say okay now and sometime
in the night we change our minds?
Tonight, tomorrow night,
you got to sleep sometime.
I'll get my sleep.
There's no point in your killing me.
Not for one share, more or less.
-Besides, you need me.
-Oh, no.
We don't need you.
We've got enough trouble without you.
The Army'll be looking for you. They'd be
more anxious to hang you than me.
No. They'll think you did it, or Apache,
and I was taken prisoner.
During all this time
that I've been chasing you around...
...I've thought it all out.
Yeah, you do need me.
You know how much gold weighs?
You especially, Mr. Mackenna.
How much is there? $1,000,000?
More? ln raw gold.
There's not enough of us here
to carry it out.
But with me, you've got a better chance
of getting there and out alive.
You're right, Sergeant.
You're welcome, Sergeant.
Coffee for the sergeant.
Only don't forget, I'm the captain.
A sergeant who kills
two of his own troopers.
-What do you think of that?
-Not a hell of a lot.
Now, be reasonable, Mackenna.
Oh, thank you.
After all, a man of my age and rank,
there's no future for me in the Army.
Do you mind, Sergeant?
Why don't you stay
with your new partners?
No hard feelings I hope, Miss Bergerman.
Easy, friend.
Mackenna's too precious to me.
Miss Bergerman?
Could it be that she's the little girl
of my old friend, the judge?
Mackenna, we'll never be true friends
if you keep secrets from me.
Let's go.
To get away from the Cavalry,
they headed for the ferry on Yellow River.
They figured they could cross over
on the raft there...
...and then double back on the trail later.
But what they didn't know was...
...that the Apaches had taken over
the whole Yellow River territory.
And there was another thing
they didn't know:
Some other Apaches
had already burned down the ferry.
But they had been in a hurry,
and the raft was still afloat.
They still had a chance.
Help me! The current's too strong!
Get out of here!
Damn Prairie Dog!
And don't you go saying
we ought to take him with us.
All right, let's go.
Now they were there. They'd reached it.
They'd reached the place
Mackenna knew as Shaking Rock.
We're here.
Where's the canyon?
Tomorrow. At sunrise.
Who says?
The map says.
-You nervous?
-No. Just thinking.
Mackenna.
-So we'll get into that canyon tomorrow--
-Not we, Sergeant. I'm not going in.
Maybe.
You might change your mind.
And you know as well as I do...
...that Colorado's not going to share
the gold with anybody.
You've had time to figure that out?
Enough. Now look, Mackenna,
you and I, we ought to stick together.
The way you stuck to your two soldiers?
Well, this is where the map ends.
I expect you to keep your word.
Show me the canyon and I will.
Well, if it's anywhere around here,
you'll see it tomorrow morning.
I want my guns. And I want the girl.
Tomorrow.
And if there's no gold,
I still get the guns and the girl.
There is gold.
You'll never know
if you shove that thing any farther.
I'm not in the mood for jokes.
What'll you do with it? Your share, I mean.
That's my business.
Well, all right.
I know what you think.
One big drunk in every stinking saloon
in Sonora, till it's all gone.
-Is that all you think I want?
-That's the way it's always been with you.
Sure, because there was never enough
for what I really want.
But when I get the gold, they'll never see
Colorado around here again. Never.
Good. Where will you go?
Sorry.
Maybe I will tell you. But if you laugh....
I won't laugh.
A millionaire in Paris.
That's right.
What is it?
Well, for whatever it's worth, he says
he's going to let us go tomorrow morning.
I don't know what's going to happen,
but from the minute you wake up...
...you keep your eye on me.
However it goes,
we're gonna have to move fast.
Do we have to?
Can't we see the gold first?
-There isn't any gold.
-But there was a map.
You saw it. It brought us here. You said
we could see the canyon in the morning.
-I heard you.
-I said a lot of things to keep us alive.
I've been running the bluff of my life.
And tomorrow morning is the showdown.
But we've come so far.
And then not even to see it.
No, listen, my father wasn't rich.
After my mother died, I wasn't only
his daughter, I was his ranch hand...
...because we couldn't afford to keep one.
But with my share,
I could buy a real ranch, a big one.
If I had your place,
I wouldn't be the marshal for five minutes.
You don't have to.
With your share,
you can do anything you want to.
You like to gamble.
Build a gambling house.
-I'll be your partner.
-You're out of your mind.
Now, wake up! Your share, my share,
there aren't going to be any shares.
I know him.
He doesn't share with anybody.
I'm sorry.
I must be crazy.
You've done so much for me. Everything.
And I'm nothing but trouble.
I don't know why you bother with me.
I have to. We're partners.
-Well, what happens?
-I never would have believed it.
I think you're gonna see that canyon
in about a minute.
-My guns.
-No, not until I see the canyon.
All right. Look at the rock.
Watch that shadow.
-What makes this?
-I don't know.
Might be a quartz deposit.
Look!
Come on!
Up there!
Mackenna! Look! I'm covered in gold.
-Come on. We're getting out.
-Getting out? No, why?
Listen to me. If we don't get away,
we're going to be killed.
We're not staying, not for all the gold
in the world. So start climbing.
No. No bullets. I take them all.
-When?
-Last night.
The spirits tell me what to do.
This is Apache gold. They tell me...
...kill everyone today.
Even you, Colorado. You are not Apache.
Don't look down.
Keep going! Climb!
Come on, keep going.
Come on. Just a little further.
You can do it.
Come on, try. A little bit more.
Come on.
Come on, climb.
Climb. Come on.
I can't.
Try!
Goodbye, old friend. No more jokes.
Mackenna!
Goodbye, Mackenna.
You know I'm coming after you.
Stay away from me, Mackenna.
Find a hole, old friend. Make it deep.
