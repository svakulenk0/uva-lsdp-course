Soldier #1: Whoa!
What do we have here?
Soldier #2:
Ooh-wee!
What's a pretty little
filly like you doing
traveling all alone?
Soldier #1:
So long, little lady.
Hyah!
Hollander:
Giddy-up, now!
Come on! Hup!
Come on, Johnny!
Come on, Rosie!
Hup! Come on!
Giddy-up!
Giddy-up, now!
Come on! Come on!
Giddy-up! Giddy-up!
Giddy-up, now!
Hyah! Hyah!
Hello, there.
Jo:
Hello.
Hollander:
Where you headed?
Jo:
This way.
Hollander:
Ha ha. A female vagrant.
Jo:
I'm not a vagrant, sir.
Hollander: Well,
that's what they'd call you
in any town I know,
if they was being nice.
Jo:
I'm traveling.
Hollander:
Well, where are you headed?
Jo:
I haven't decided.
Hollander:
Ha! Vagrant, like I said.
Jo:
Which way are you headed?
Hollander:
That way.
You want a ride?
Come on.
That's it.
Come on.
Here we go.
Whoa!
Oh, you been lugging this?
Come on, now.
Up we get.
There we go. Ahh.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
The name's streight hollander.
Jo:
Josephine monaghan.
Hollander:
Very nice.
Come on! Come on! Hyah!
Come on! Hey!
Ugh!
Ha ha ha.
Come on, now,
make yourself useful.
Arrange them plates, huh?
Give it
the lady's touch, huh?
Woman: How much do you want
for this chair?
Hollander:
How much it worth to you?
Woman:
Nearly nothing. It's broke.
Hollander: Nevertheless,
it's a superb chair,
and I'll accept
no less than $3.75.
Woman: Ohh!
Hollander: What can I
sell you today, soldier?
Soldier:
Can we see you, mister?
Hollander: Ah, looks like you're
doing the selling today, huh?
Mind the store, daughter.
Woman: Morning.
Jo:
$3.75 isn't so much.
It's a beautiful chair.
Woman:
Oh, all right.
Jo:
Thank you.
Soldier: Hyah! Hyah!
Hollander:
How's it going over here?
Jo:
I sold the chair.
Hollander:
To that sourpuss?
-Jo: Yes.
-Hollander: Well...
It looks like you earned
yourself a day's pay.
Jo:
All right, sir.
Hollander:
Two bits okay?
Jo: Yes.
I believe that's fair.
Hollander:
All right, here you go.
Jo:
Thank you.
Hollander:
Good. Heh heh.
All right.
Jo: First money
I've ever earned.
-Hollander: Is that right?
-Jo: Mm-hmm.
Hollander:
Oh, come on, Josephine...
Read to me.
You look like
the kind of girl
who knows how to read.
Jo:
Hawthorne?
Excellent choice,
Mr. hollander.
Hollander:
Yeah.
Jo:
"The evening before
"my departure for blythedale,
"I was returning
to my bachelor apartments
"after attending
a wonderful exhibition
"of 'the veiled lady'
"when a elderly man
of rather shabby appearance
"met me in an obscure
part of the street.
"'Mr. Coverdale,'
said he softly,
'can I speak
with you a moment?'"
hollander:
Beautiful reader.
Beautiful.
Jo:
"As I have casually alluded
"to 'the veiled lady,'
"it may not be amiss to mention
"for the benefit
of such of my readers
"as are unacquainted
"with her
now-forgotten celebrity
that she was a phenomenon --"
Soldier: Hyah!
Hollander: Here she is, boys!
Come and get her!
Come here!
Boys, come and get her!
Soldier: Whoa!
You're mine now, pretty lady!
Hyah!
Yahoo!
Hollander:
Give me my money!
I sold her to you
fair and square!
Soldier:
Quiet, old man!
Hyah!
Jo:
Soldier:
Hyah! Hyah!
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!
Hyah!
Hyah!
Hyah! Hyah!
Jo: Aah!
No!
No!
Soldier:
Hyah! Hyah!
Jo: Aah!
Soldier: Hyah!
Whoa! Easy, boy!
We'll find ya!
Woman:
What happened to you, girl?
Jo:
Have you seen two soldiers?
Woman: They came by
about an hour ago.
Looking for a lost sister,
they said.
Jo:
I need to buy some things.
Woman:
You do?
You got any money?
Jo:
Yes.
Woman:
All right.
Jo:
Don't you have any dresses?
Woman:
Not ready-made.
This is what we got.
And needles and thread.
It's against the law
to dress improper to your sex.
Jo:
Yes, ma'am.
Hill: Mr. monaghan,
the portraits should be ready
Tuesday,
if you'd like to come by
for them.
Or perhaps miss monaghan
could come by for them?
Jo:
Good afternoon, Mr. hill.
Hill:
Good afternoon, miss monaghan.
Jo:
I've come for the portraits.
Hill: You've never seen
a picture of yourself?
Jo: No.
Hill:
You look beautiful.
Jo:
I think I look funny.
May I see the others?
Mr. monaghan: I want that whore
out of my house!
Out of my sight!
She and her bastard
can die in the street.
Jo:
Helen, will you keep my baby?
I don't care about myself
as long as I know
my child is taken care of.
Aah!
Is this Ruby city?
Lyle: Yeah.
That's quite a scar.
I guess you must have come
a long way, huh?
What's your name, kid?
Jo:
Jo monaghan, sir.
Lyle:
Well, I'm Lyle hogg,
and this here is Sam.
Jo: Are there really rubies
in these hills?
Lyle: Look, kid, that's what
the first man thought,
but they just turned
out to be garnets.
Sam:
The hills are full of 'em.
Lyle: And they ain't
worth much at all.
Most men around here
are digging for gold.
Jo:
I don't mind striking gold.
Where can I get outfitted?
Lyle: Livery stable up ahead,
on the right.
Sam:
You can't miss it.
Jo:
Thank you, Mr. hogg, Sam.
Man:
Thanks, Mary.
Mary:
You need anything else?
Man:
Good stew, miss Addie.
Mrs. Addie:
Here you go.
Jo:
Thank you, ma'am.
Mary:
How's the stew, Jack?
Mr. Addie: Looks like
a back-easter to me.
Mrs. Addie:
Well, he could be.
But he don't got no money.
Mr. Addie:
What makes you so sure?
Mrs. Addie:
Well, his hands are clean,
but his clothes stink
like everybody else's.
Lyle:
It's a nickel to you.
Badger:
Looks like a dude to me.
-Lyle: I don't think so.
-Badger: Could be trouble.
Yeah.
Lyle: The bet's Howie's.
Mary: I need two beers
and a whiskey.
Badger: We don't like
dudes around here.
Lyle: We had a dude
dropped in here the other day.
He had on black
and yellow stockings.
Sam: Striped.
Badger: We run him out of town,
barefoot.
I guess you better
take off your boot.
Lyle:
Take off your boots, son.
Sam:
Not so fast.
Lyle: Maybe you got
a knife in your boot.
See, Frank, I told you
he weren't no dude.
Sam:
That's what I said.
Badger: No offense,
but there's nothing
I hate more than a dude.
Jo: They've got as much right
to be here as you do, mister.
Badger:
Do they, now?
Corcoran: Why don't you leave
the boy alone, Frank badger?
He just wants to go his own way.
Lyle: Percy,
we were just being friendly.
Badger:
Fair enough, Percy.
Fair enough.
Jo:
Good night...Gentlemen.
Corcoran: This ground
turns to ice in winter.
Jo: Is that what you rode out
to tell me, Mr. corcoran?
Corcoran:
Not a nugget in sight, huh?
Jo:
No, sir.
Not yet.
But any day now, I'm sure.
Corcoran: Many different sorts
of men come here,
and most of them
leave the same --
tired, broke, and hungry.
Oh!
Working in the assay office
is enough for me.
It's steady pay and a warm bed.
They're looking
for a hand, you know,
over at the livery stable.
Jo:
Are they?
Corcoran: Pretty heavy work
for a slight fellow.
You've got to shovel
a lot of muck.
Jo: I think I've gotten
the hang of that.
Corcoran: I've noticed your
horse is always well-tended.
Jo:
Thank you, sir.
Think they'd let me bunk there?
The hotel is...
Well...
Corcoran:
Not much room for decency?
Jo:
Exactly, sir.
Corcoran: I could rent you a bed
for a small fee.
Jo:
I wouldn't want to impose.
Corcoran:
I've got room to spare, Jo.
All right, then.
Jo:
Thank you, Mr. corcoran.
Corcoran:
Do you know how to cook?
Jo:
Not really, sir.
Corcoran:
Good to know.
Saved me quite a lot of money
over the years.
Peel that.
And you won't have
to put up with a woman
your whole life.
Jo: What's wrong
with having a woman around?
Corcoran:
I had a wife...
For a while.
I found women to be
more trouble than they're worth.
Jo:
What happened to your wife?
Corcoran:
Don't ask me about the past,
and I won't ask you.
Jo:
All right.
Corcoran:
Once a month,
I visit the girls
in their tents.
That's sufficient.
Cheaper in the long run
and less trouble.
I see Mary's eyes
follow you.
Will you be courting her?
Jo:
No.
Corcoran: You're more like me,
I think.
Better off alone, mostly.
Jo:
Maybe.
Corcoran:
Well, dump that in the pot.
Now, don't tell me
you've never smoked.
Jo:
No, sir.
Corcoran:
If I cared to know...
I'd wonder
where you come from.
Jo:
My father smoked cigars.
Corcoran:
Son of a rich man, eh?
Jo: Mm.
Corcoran:
Now, don't draw too hard.
-Jo:
-Corcoran:
Just a little
and taste it.
That's it.
Now, as you smoke...
Close your eyes.
Go on, close your eyes.
Think about your future.
Duke Billy: All right,
you hard-rock miners,
drop those picks and axes.
Come on out,
you hard-time miners!
We got something better
for you.
Old Duke Billy's
coming to town.
That's right, gents,
come on out.
Drop those pans
and drop those pants.
Come on out, gents.
That's right, drop those pans,
drop those pants.
Come on out, boys.
Come down from the hills.
That's right.
Hey, drop those axes,
get off your asses.
Get out of those tents.
Come take a look
at what Duke Billy has to offer.
Come on out and meet elvira.
She can't hear,
and she can't talk.
Come and see her,
it's worth the walk.
That's right.
Come on in, gents.
Bring your boots and britches.
Here you go, my pretty.
That's a llama, from Peru.
Man: Oh, boy!
Mrs. Addie: Mary, go get me
a couple of rabbits
and a sack of beans, okay?
Okay, everybody,
now, that's enough.
Now get that horse
out of my saloon.
Get him out of here!
Badger: Hey, Jo.
How about a drink on me?
Jo:
No, thanks, Mr. badger.
Badger: Hey...
Tonight's the night
you've been waiting for.
Jo:
I don't think so.
Badger: This is a rare
opportunity, young man.
Jo:
I'm sure you're right, sir.
Badger: Little Jo,
I think you should reconsider.
A man can get diseases
he don't do it regular.
Jack Wilkins,
what the hell
are you doing here?
Wilkins:
Same thing as you, Frank.
Badger:
By God, if you left my sheep...
Wilkins:
I left the dog.
They'll be fine
for a couple of days.
Badger:
You're a son of a bitch!
Wilkins:
I had enough.
Drive a man crazy
out there all alone.
Badger: Shit!
Man:
Mr. Billy, look at this.
The whole thing.
The whole thing,
but I get number one.
All right, what's the name,
there? What's the name?
Corcoran:
Big night tonight, eh, Jo?
Jo: Mm.
Badger:
Hey, over here! Badger!
Badger! Badger!
B-a-d-g-e-r!
God damn it!
Duke Billy:
All right, who's next here?
Badger:
Hey, little Jo,
I got something
I want to show you.
Mary: Jo. You going?
Duke Billy: All right, boys!
All right, boys!
Everybody settle down, now!
All right!
Number one is big Al,
the gold nugget man!
Frank badger!
Jo: Dear Helen,
are you holding my laddie
close in your arms?
I think of him constantly
and miss you both fiercely.
I've made it out west
and decided to settle
for a while in Ruby city.
It is really far
from being a city.
Truly, it is a mining camp
which may someday
become a town.
Duke Billy:
Bad Chad!
Chester Albert!
Corcoran!
Mary: Jo? Jo?
You better come quick!
Percy's gone crazy!
Jo:
Percy?
Mary: Hurry!
He's in there.
Corcoran: God, you're a whore!
Get out!
Jo: Percy!
Corcoran:
Jo.
Elvira:
Corcoran:
Aw, to hell with this chola!
Jo:
Give me the gun, Percy.
Corcoran: She wouldn't put it
in her mouth.
Jo:
Let's go home.
Corcoran:
I didn't get my turn yet.
Jo:
Another time, Percy.
Elvira:
Corcoran: Yeah, you -- you need
a good shagging, too, Jo.
Everybody thinks
something's wrong with you.
Duke Billy:
You rotten son of a bitch!
Mr. Addie:
Get him out of here!
Get that bloody Saxon
out of here now!
Jo:
Mr. badger?
Badger: What?
Jo: Have you hired
another sheepherder yet?
Badger: Now, when would I
have done that?
Jo: Jobs seem to be
pretty scarce.
I figured someone
would've jumped at it.
Badger:
No one jumps at spending
a winter in a line camp.
Jo: What's that, sir?
Badger: Oh, that's where
there's no one but you,
a dog, and some sheep
for four months
of the worst alone
at the furthest edge
of any sheep land.
Jo:
I'd like the job, sir.
Badger:
What do you know about sheep?
What do you know about
surviving through the winter
in these --
in these mountains?
Jo: Nothing.
Badger:
Well, you can...
You can learn about sheep.
Jo:
I believe so, sir.
Badger:
Do you have any idea what...
That kind of aloneness
will do to a man?
Huh?
Drive most of 'em crazy.
Jo:
I believe it'll suit me, sir.
Badger: Maybe it will.
I been trying
to figure you out
since you got here.
Maybe you're one
of those strange ones
that can't stand company.
Jo: That would be hard
for you to understand
since you can't seem
to get enough company...Sir.
Badger: All right.
You got one month
till full winter sets in.
Just do me a favor --
if you can't handle it,
you come and tell me.
Don't jeopardize my flock.
I pay double wages
through the winter.
Here's two months
in advance.
You get the rest
in the spring.
Well, my wife's waiting.
Jo:
I didn't know you had a wife.
Badger:
Of course I do.
I got eight kids, too.
No shortage of company.
Mary:
Here's some milk.
Woman: Oh.
Mary: For you.
Woman:
Mary: No?
Here you go.
Jo!
They rode in this morning.
Their homestead's South
of badger's sheep land.
I told them
you'd guide them out.
Jo:
Okay.
Mary: This is Jo.
He'll guide you out there.
Woman:
Homestead?
Nick: Homestead? Guide?
Jo:
I'll try to get you there.
Man:
Homestead. Homestead.
Jo:
Yes, sir. Homestead.
Man:
Mary:
Goodbye, Jo.
Hope I see you next spring.
Jo: Bye, Mary.
Mary: Bye. Bye.
Woman:
Jo: This is it.
Man: Homestead?
Jo: Yes.
Your homestead.
Man:
Jo:
Hello, sweet lass.
For me?
Thank you.
I'll take her with me
for the winter,
and I'll bring her back
in the spring.
Woman:
Jo: Come on.
Come on.
That's right.
Yes.
Yes.
Man: Come on!
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!
Jo:
What a fine house.
Woman:
Nick:
My mother says thank you.
Jo:
You're welcome.
Lyle:
Hey! Little Jo!
Little Jo monaghan,
you're back.
Jo:
Lyle, you got a clean shirt.
Lyle: Yeah.
We got a laundry now.
Dupre:
I charge a dollar a shirt.
$8.00 for a dozen.
Seems like a lot,
but that's the goin' price.
For those who want to be clean,
they don't mind payin'.
Try gettin' a new shirt
in these parts.
Lyle:
Thank you, Mrs. dupre.
Today is Mary's wedding.
Come on.
Jo: Mary?
Lyle: Oh, you didn't know.
I'm sorry, Jo.
Jo: Who's she marrying?
Lyle: Well, this fella --
uh, Mr. brown --
he was passing through town,
and he's got a spread
down in Texas,
and they're leaving
right after the wedding.
Man: We are gathered here today
in the sight of God
to join together
Lucas and Mary
in holy matrimony.
If anyone here knows
of any reason
why these two
should not be married,
let them speak now
or forever hold his peace.
Lucas, do you take Mary,
here present,
for your lawful wife?
Will you love her and honor her
and cherish her
as long as you both shall live?
Lucas: I will.
Man: Mary,
do you take Lucas, here present,
to be your lawful husband?
Will you love him
and honor him and obey him
as long as you both shall live?
Mary: I will.
Man: Lucas,
please give Mary the ring.
By the power vested in me
by the United States,
I pronounce you man and wife.
Man:
Congratulations, Mary.
We're going to miss you, Mary.
You'll have to give me
my haircuts now.
You got quite a catch
there, fella.
A lucky man!
Jo:
Hello, Percy.
Corcoran: I didn't think
you'd survive through winter.
Jo:
I love it out there alone.
Corcoran: Uh-huh.
Oh, a letter came for you.
About two months ago.
Mr. Addie:
Boys, a toast
to the most beautiful lass
in these mountains --
my Mary and her husband, Lucas.
All: Hear! Hear!
Man:
Congratulations, Mary.
We'll miss you, Mary.
Jo:
So long, Mary.
Lyle:
Oh, poor little Jo.
Uh-oh!
Lookee here, boys.
Little Jo's got a gun!
All: Ohhh!
Sam:
Let me see that.
Jo: "Dear sister,
I have lain awake nights
"picturing you
in your wild wanderings
"with your boy pressed
tightly in my arms.
"I have prayed
to a merciful God
to keep you safe
and unharmed."
You read it?
Corcoran: Yes.
You made a fool out of me,
Josephine.
Jo: I didn't intend to do that,
Percy.
Corcoran: I took you in thinking
you were such a pathetic boy.
I was going to make a man
out of you.
Jo:
You taught me a lot, Percy.
You gave me guidance.
You helped me learn to survive.
Corcoran:
But you're a female.
And a whore at that,
if I understood
that letter correctly.
Did you ever kill a man?
Jo: I'll never forget
that woman's face
as long as I live.
Corcoran: Oh, is that
what happened to you?
Jo: No.
Corcoran:
I've been thinking
of leaving...
Josephine.
Ever since that night...
No one says anything,
but I've seen the look,
so I'll go.
But I haven't got a penny,
so you're going to
have to finance my move.
Or else I'll tell them
the truth
about mysterious little Jo.
They wonder about you.
They'll never forgive you.
And that kind of story
spreads like wildfire.
It'll be all over the west
by summer.
You won't have nowhere to go.
I'll keep my promise,
Josephine.
Jo:
If you don't, Percy...
I'll find you...
And I will kill you.
"Dear sister,
I have lain awake nights
"picturing you
in your wild wanderings
"with your boy pressed
tightly in my arms.
"I have prayed
to a merciful God
"to keep you safe
and unharmed.
"When I think of all
my comforts and luxuries,
"and then of my Josephine
"sleeping by night
on a blanket
"and traveling by day
"with that crowd
of rough men and uncouth women
"you described
in your letter,
"I feel I cannot bear it.
"I'm glad you decided
to stay in one place,
"although the camp
sounds so awful.
"Still,
I know where to find you.
"Your boy is sitting
on the floor beside me.
"He had a slight cold
but is quite well now.
"I hardly know
how to live without him.
"I also am well and still
longing for your return.
"It takes so long
for a letter to reach me
"that I hope you will not delay
in answering this one.
"Your last letter
was such a comfort.
"Goodbye for now
with lots of love
from Helen."
Woman:
Nick: Orange.
Say it in English.
Woman: Orange.
Mmm!
Mmm.
Nick: Mother asks
if you'll stay for supper.
Jo:
Thank you.
Woman:
Nick:
It'll be good to have company,
especially with father gone
trading all week.
Woman:
Badger:
Here you are.
Jo: I quit, Frank.
Badger:
What are you talking about?
Jo: I quit.
Got a homestead,
and this'll pay
for the flock.
Badger: You dirty little
son of a bitch.
Jo: Frank...
You know Nick.
Badger: Sure.
Jo: He'll know everything
about sheep herding
when I'm finished with him.
Badger: Do I have any say-so
in this?
Jo:
He's a good, hard worker.
Badger:
No, I guess I don't.
Nick: Mr. badger.
Jo:
So I bought the land
just past yours on the west.
-Badger: Near the river.
-Jo: That's right.
Badger: By God,
I had my eye on that land.
But I'm glad you bought it
instead of that goddamn
Western cattle company.
Jo: Who are they?
Badger:
Couple of eastern speculators.
They bought 50,000 acres
for raising cattle.
Jo: There are no cattle
around here.
Badger:
There will be.
Jo:
Sheep and cattle don't mix.
Badger:
No, they don't.
Nick:
No. They don't.
Badger: Well...Hell.
I'm going to miss you, Jo,
but we'll be neighbors.
Jo:
Don't crowd me, Frank.
Badger: Little Jo,
you are the unfriendliest fella
I ever met...
And frankly...
Quite peculiar.
Yee-haw!
Grey: When you finish moving
all of those,
I want you to do
some things in here,
so check with me.
Well, it's coming along,
but it's taking a long time,
isn't it?
Man: It's shining up real nice,
sir.
Man: Gonna hang you,
you thieving Chinese!
Coming around here,
trying to take
our work from us!
You're gonna go to hell!
Jo: Let him go, Frank.
Badger: Now...Jo...
The fella had the nerve
to walk into Ruby city
looking for work
like a free white man.
Man: We're sick of these
slant-eyed son of a bitches
stealing our jobs.
Jo:
He's just trying to eat.
Badger: Jo, you're a righteous
son of a bitch.
You're always opposing me.
Jo: I'm not out to oppose you,
Frank.
We just don't agree.
Badger:
Don't you ever have any fun?
Jo: We don't agree
on what's fun, either.
Badger:
By God, that's for sure!
Jo: Let him go, you fool.
Badger: He ain't a man.
He's a celestial heathen.
They're all ravishers
and opium smokers.
Jo: Cut him down, Frank.
Badger:
Whoa! Don't shoot.
All right, Jo, all right.
We was just having a little fun.
Who's gonna feed him, Jo?
Jo:
What are you talking about?
Badger: I'm saying
you should hire him, little Jo.
-Jo: What?
-Badger: If I let him go,
he's probably gonna
starve to death
'cause there ain't no work
around here for no chinaman...
Or he'll move on
and take some job away
from some white man...
Unless, of course,
you hire him
to cook and keep house.
Jo: You are a drunken
pain in the ass.
Badger:
His death's on your hands, Jo.
Jo:
I don't need a cook!
Badger: It's nice havin' a hot
meal ready when you get home.
Jo:
My cooking's fine.
Badger: Too lonely out there.
You need company!
Jo:
I don't want company!
Badger:
You'll go crazy without it!
I've seen it happen to men,
and it worries me!
Jo: Who asked you
to worry about me?
Badger:
I can't help it.
Jo:
I can't afford a cook.
Badger: You can afford him!
What's your name?
Wong: Tinman wong.
Badger: You can afford
tinman wong. Can't he?
-Yeah!
-Damn right!
Badger: Can't he?
Jo: I thought the meal
was supposed to be ready
when I got home.
Wong:
I did not know what time.
Tomorrow it will be ready.
Jo:
Needs pepper.
Wong:
Yes, Mr. Jo.
Jo:
You move things around in here?
Wong: Perhaps.
By mistake while cleaning.
Jo:
Put 'em back where they were.
Wong: Yes, Mr. Jo.
Retire outside after supper.
I like my privacy.
I left you some mending.
Wong:
Yes, Mr. Jo.
Jo:
I told you to get out
after supper!
You can build a shelter tomorrow
if you want.
Thought you worked
on the railroad
for a long time.
Wong:
But I was very sick last winter.
And I'm not very strong anymore.
You're not Mr. Jo.
Jo:
What?
Is your name really tinman?
Wong: No.
The correct pronunciation
is tien ma.
Jo: I can see
how it ended up tinman.
Wong:
Is your name really Jo?
Jo: Yes.
It's short for Josephine...
Not Joseph.
Who are you, tinman wong?
Wong:
You are the mystery one, Mr. Jo.
Jo:
Who did this to you?
Wong:
Hoodlums in San Francisco.
White men in mining town.
Railroad boss.
And this?
Who is this society girl?
Jo: Me.
Can you imagine?
Wong: I like you much better
as you are.
Jo: Why?
Wong: This white girl
would never do this with me.
You ever smoke opium?
Jo: No.
Frank badger was right.
You're just a ravisher
and an opium smoker.
It's not that cold.
You just love that coat.
Ahh.
Wong: 15 years on the railroad,
rain or shine.
I am always cold.
Badger:
Yee-haw!
Jo: It's badger.
It stinks in here!
Badger:
Yee-haw!
Hey, Jo!
Jo!
Hey, Jo!
Little Jo.
Jo: Frank.
Badger: Whoo!
Well,
it's a long way from home.
Awful cold.
Your place looks
mighty inviting.
Jo:
Well, come on in.
Badger: I'll put the horse
in the corral.
Hello, tinman.
How ya doin'?
Wong:
Fine, Mr. Frank. Fine.
Badger:
What you got cooking in there?
It smells awful good.
Wong: Coyote stew.
Badger: Coyote stew?
Oh-hoo!
-Mmm!
-Wong: Mmm.
Jo: Excuse me.
Badger: Cattle company's bought
up a lot of small homesteads.
They're trying to squeeze me,
buying up all the land
around mine --
sons of bitches.
There's plenty of cattle land
for those eastern speculators
in other territories.
Jo: I don't think
they see it that way.
Badger: Have they made you
an offer yet?
Jo: I'm not selling.
I worked too hard
to build this place.
Badger:
They bought 50,000 acres, Jo.
Jo: Well, then they don't need
my 800 or your 5,000.
Badger: There's talk of
having elections next spring.
Jo: In Ruby city?
Badger: Mm-hmm.
Jo:
That's just a mining camp.
Badger: Well, maybe having
a mayor will make it a town.
Jo: I keep expecting
that place to disappear.
Badger:
Not if I can help it.
You know, Jo...
Folks sure wish
you'd get involved.
Jo:
I appreciate that,
but you know I'm not much
for getting involved.
Badger: But we need educated men
like yourself, by God,
to make something
out of this place.
Jo:
You can count on my vote, Frank.
I'll be there on election day.
Badger: Good.
Well, you two seem to be
gettin' along just fine.
Jo: Seems to be working out
better than I thought.
Badger: Sorry about tying you up
like that.
Nothing personal.
Wong: Oh, no, Mr. Frank.
Badger:
You're a damn good cook.
Wong:
Oh, thank you.
Badger:
You know, tinman,
I always did like
a smoke of opium now and then.
Jo:
What are you talking about?
Badger: Well, I'm sure I smelled
some when I first came in.
Jo:
You must be mistaken.
Badger: The sweetness
is pretty unmistakable.
Jo: I don't allow
any of that in my house.
If you want a smoke of tobacco,
you're welcome.
Badger: Well...
I guess I better get goin'.
Jo:
Yeah, I guess so.
That goddamn nosy
son of a bitch!
Wong:
He wants to be your friend.
Jo:
I don't need any friends.
We all smoke opium together,
and he'd be coming over
to dinner
every Sunday from now on!
Wong:
That's true, Mr. Jo.
Jo: How long do you think
it would take him
to figure out about me?
It took you three days.
Wong:
But that is me.
Jo:
Well, then, what about us?
What do you think would happen
if they found out about me?
Little Jo monaghan
turns out to be a woman
and she's lovers
with an ailing chinaman.
They'd kill us.
Wong:
Unquestionably.
Brutally.
Jo: Why can't we...
Just live as we are?
Wong:
I was not defending Mr. Frank.
He is a thick-head,
too stupid to see what is.
I want peace
for the last years of my life.
You found it living as a man.
I found it living with you.
Jo:
I miss my son.
Wong: Yes.
But you are
a free white man now.
And someday soon,
you will even vote.
Man: Let's go!
Jo:
Wong:
What are you doing?
Jo.
Jo: You can't sleep in here
tonight.
Wong: Why?
Jo:
Because I don't want you here!
Get out!
Get out!
Wong:
When will you go out?
You have a flock to tend.
Jo: Tinman.
Wong:
What are you doing?
Jo: I'm making a pie.
Wong: Why?
Jo: For you.
I want to make a pie for you.
Wong: I don't need a pie.
I make very good pies!
What is this?
What is this?
Jo:
I've decided to sell.
Wong:
When did you decide that?
Jo: I can't live like this
anymore.
It's a chance for us
to start over somewhere else.
Wong: What kind of girl
could you be somewhere else?
What man would want you?
You have no hair!
Half your face is destroyed
with that ugly scar.
You can't even make a pie!
Jo:
Then you fight 'em!
Man: Whoa.
Jo: Thank you for coming,
Mrs. badger.
Ruth: Well, I haven't done
anything yet.
Jo:
He's in there.
Ruth:
I got the onions and the tar.
You go get me a pine branch.
Okay.
Take it all.
All of it!
All of it.
Wong:
Ruth:
Come on back, little fella.
Come on back.
Jo: What do we need
a pine branch for?
Badger:
Damned if I know.
Well, I guess you two
got to be almost
like friends...
Out here all alone.
Jo:
Yes, he's my friend.
Badger: Huh.
Well, if he don't make it,
we'll get you another chinaman.
By God, they're damn
good cooks and housekeepers,
ain't they?
Ruth:
Yeah, that'll do just fine.
Badger:
You think he gonna make it?
Ruth: Well...
He's got one foot
on the other side.
Why don't you two fellas
go on outside?
Being in a sick house,
there's no place
for hanging around.
Badger:
Oh! I almost forgot.
Your letter.
Jo: I've been thinking
about going back east, Frank.
Badger:
Who's the letter from?
Jo: My sister.
Badger: I didn't know you had
a sister.
Jo: "Dear Jo,
"it's been so long
since we heard from you.
"Laddie gets bigger
every day.
"He's already
such a handsome little man.
"You'd be so proud of him.
"Jo, he asked for you so much
and longed for you so terribly
that I finally told him
you had died."
Badger: You know, Jo,
there's an election Saturday.
We can ride in together,
you and I.
Grey: Get up!
Badger:
What the hell does he want?
Grey: Get up! Get up!
Get up!
Badger:
You dirty, lying bastard!
You sold out!
Monaghan's not selling, grey!
Grey: Please control yourself,
Mr. badger.
Jo:
Yes, I am, Frank.
Grey: You shoot me,
you'll hang within the week.
Badger: You're the one
I ought to kill,
you puny little bastard,
helping them squeeze me.
Grey:
Badger, we don't want your land.
Badger: By God, boy, I thought
you'd amount to something.
-Ruth!
-Ruth: Yeah.
Badger: When you come
to my house, Mr. grey,
you either give
your wife and kid guns
or leave them home.
Ruth: Seems a shame.
Grey: Okay.
It's all right, darling.
Henry:
I wasn't afraid, father.
Grey:
Well, Mr. monaghan,
this is my wife, Mrs. grey,
and my son, Henry.
This is Mr. monaghan, darling.
He's selling his ranch to us --
to the Western cattle company.
He's decided to go back east.
Jo:
How do you do, ma'am?
Beatrice:
How do you do, Mr. monaghan?
You made a wise decision,
I'm sure.
Henry: Mr. monaghan,
how did you get that scar?
Beatrice: Henry,
apologize to Mr. monaghan.
Grey: Beatrice,
he didn't mean any harm.
Beatrice: There is no excuse
for bad manners.
Henry:
I'm sorry, Mr. monaghan.
Grey: My wife and son
just arrived from Boston.
I brought them out
this afternoon
to show them
some of the countryside.
Jo: What do you think of it,
Mrs. grey?
Beatrice: It would be a fine
adventure for a short while.
Grey: Yeah, actually,
we've been searching
for the perfect spot
to build our new ranch house.
Jo: Really?
Beatrice: We've seen
many beautiful vistas,
but not an ounce of culture
for a thousand Miles.
Jo:
Did you bring the papers?
Grey:
And a check, Mr. monaghan.
Excuse us, darling.
We'll just be a few minutes.
Beatrice:
Henry, can't you sit still?
Henry:
Goodness, no, mother.
Grey: Those of us raised
and educated in the east,
Mr. monaghan,
can never truly call
this wild country home.
Beatrice:
Henry, don't touch that sheep!
Ugh!
Come wipe your hands.
Come here immediately.
Sit quietly
until your father gets back.
Grey: Ah...If you'll
just sign here,
you can be on your way.
Jo: I've changed my mind,
Mr. grey.
Grey:
Is that wise, Mr. monaghan?
Jo: Does your wife know
how many people
you've had killed?
Grey:
How dare you, monaghan?
I suggest you sign.
Jo:
Tomorrow's election day.
I guess I'll ride into town
with Frank badger.
Wong:
They will come after you.
Jo: Yes.
Wong: I will try to travel
if you want.
Jo:
There's no place I want to go.
Badger:
Sons of bitches.
Aah! Aah!
Jo: Aah!
Badger: Yee-haw!
Yee-haw!
Jo! Jo!
Oh, God damn it, little Jo,
I told you you'd get in trouble
out here all alone.
Jo:
Badger: Hold on.
I'm gonna take you to town.
I'm gonna go hitch up
the buckboard.
Now, God damn you,
don't you die on me.
Hyah!
Woman:
Oh, my God!
Badger: Uhh!
I want little Jo monaghan
to have the best funeral ever
in Ruby city.
Stith:
Yes, sir, Mr. badger.
Badger: Hey!
Little Jo monaghan is dead.
-No.
-How did it happen?
Badger: Come on, Nick.
Drinks on me, everybody.
Lyle: He kinda changed
after Percy left.
Sam:
Well, I plum forgot about him.
Badger: Hmph!
I never did like that Percy.
Mrs. Addie: I was surprised
little Jo took to him
the way he did.
Badger: I thought for sure
that he'd settle down with Mary.
Mrs. Addie: He'd have been
a good husband to my girl.
They'd have stayed nearby.
Sam:
We'd a-seed her again.
Lyle: Yep. Sweet Mary.
Badger: By God,
they would've made fine kids.
Here's to little Jo monaghan.
Mrs. Addie: Little Jo.
Stith: Mr. badger.
Badger: Yeah, what?
What's the matter?
Stith:
It's about little Jo.
Badger: Well, speak up, man.
What about him?
Stith: He was a woman.
Lyle: What?
Mrs. Addie:
Lyle:
Hoist that feller up there, Jim.
Bill, give us a hand,
will you, please?
Thank you.
Hurry up over on
the other side, there, zeb.
Thataboy.
Perfect.
Tyler:
What are you doin'?
How am I supposed
to take a picture of that?
Lyle: Well, maybe...
Maybe somebody ought
to get us a rope.
Does somebody
got a rope here?
Give it here, son.
How is that?
Tyler: You old fool.
Open his eyes.
How can I take
a decent photograph
with his eyes closed?
Lyle:
His eyes, Sam.
Sam:
eyes, Lyle.
Lyle:
Oh.
Badger:
Dirty son of a bitch!
God damn you!
You were just fooling
and lying! Yeah!
Son of a bitch!
God damn you!
Aah! God damn!
God damn!
My God, little Jo.
