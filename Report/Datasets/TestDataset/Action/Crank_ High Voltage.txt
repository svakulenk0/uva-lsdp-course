REPORTER:
In a story so bizarre...
I can scarcely believe
the event I'm reporting...
and yet corroborated
by a dozen eyewitnesses...
a white male apparently fell
from the sky...
above downtown
Los Angeles today...
landed in the middle
of a busy intersection...
destroying one vehicle
and hospitalizing its elderly driver...
and was removed from the scene...
before emergency personnel
could respond.
Without a body, the police have yet
to piece together events of a day...
that can only be described
as implausible.
Reports of a body
landing in the Boyle Heights area...
have yet to be confirmed,
and are being treated...
as the bullshit they most likely are.
Ooh.
- Ahh.
- Ahh.
You big cock English.
Strong like horse.
Fuck that.
That's not so bad.
Nice.
Pick up, Eve.
OPERATOR: The number
you have reached is not in service.
Fuck.
Shit.
You lost?
Nope.
Shit.
Shit.
On your knees, Slim.
Okay, Chow Mein.
- Who do you work for?
- Fuck you, Chelios.
Fucking grunt.
You found me in quite an unpleasant
mood this morning, mate.
Now, I'm gonna ask you this question
one time.
Who's gots
my fucking strawberry tart?
- Oh.
- Capiche?
- Just spit the fucking name out.
- Aah!
Johnny Vang! Aah!
Johnny fucking Vang?
Johnny fucking Vang?
- Good boy. Where?
- Cypress Social Club! Aah!
Cypress... Cypress Social Club.
Now, you're sure about that, ain't you?
Good boy. Thanks for coming.
Now, you can keep that.
Fuck.
Hello. Doc Miles.
Yeah, Doc, it's Chev.
Jesus H. Chelios.
You gotta be kidding me.
Listen.
I'm deadly fucking serious, Doc.
These Triad motherfuckers
cutout my fucking heart...
and put in
one of those artificial jobs.
You got an artificial heart'?
Ha-ha-ha.
You think I'm having a fucking laugh?
No, but you gotta admit,
it's a little out there.
- You take your fucking time, Doc.
- You don't have any time.
They're not designed to keep you alive
more than a couple of days.
- And don't do anything strenuous.
- Yeah, sure, Doc. No problem.
So, what's my next fucking move?
We gotta get a real heart put in you,
preferably your own.
- I'm on it.
- Okay, you're on it.
- Doc, Jesus fucking Christ!
- I'm sorry. Sorry.
Let me... Does that thing have a...
A belt battery pack?
- Check.
- How many bars are showing?
- One.
- Shit. That's better than none, I guess.
Look, what they did you with
is an Avicor Total Artificial Heart.
It's got an internal battery that'll
pick up once the belt battery dies.
It's like a reserve tank.
Once the internal battery takes over,
you got one fucking hour.
The internal battery
charges wirelessly...
through a transcutaneous
energy-transfer system.
Two coils...
There's one internal, one external.
That transmit via a magnetic force
across the skin...
without piercing the surface.
The internal coil receives power
and sends it to the controller device.
Does this make any fucking sense
to you, Chevy?
It's fucking Greek, Doc.
Greek.
Look, you gotta keep your body
electrically charged...
- ...to keep that piece of shit pumping.
- Copy that.
- Hey, Chev?
- Yeah.
- I'm stoked you're alive, dude.
- I'll get back to you, Doc.
Yeah, well, call me.
Fuck.
Hey, hey, hey! That's a nice car.
Don't suppose you know where
the Cypress Social Club is, do you?
Man, fuck that shit,
Let's race, ése.
Ha-ha-ha. Don't you tempt me, fucker.
What I need from you is directions.
AW, Shit.
Shit.
Damn, dog. You good,
Tiger fucking Woods.
Never better.
Greatest day of my fucking life.
You couldn't point me in the direction
of the Cypress Social Club, could you?
Well, you ain't too far.
Go down Orange for, like, 2 miles,
and then you're there, homes.
Oh.
You mind giving me a jump?
Just juice me
Anybody know
where's the fucking Social Club?
boy.
This is a fucking social club?
- You Johnny Vang?
- Uh-uh.
Go.
WOMAN :
- Get lost, bitch.
- Fuck you.
- What?
- Where's Johnny Vang?
You looking to get your ass killed?
- Wrong expression.
- You ain't tapping my ass.
There you go, cupcake.
Fucking no balling
for me today, thanks.
There goes my ride!
What is that? Fucking cunt-onese?
I'd rather stick my dick in a blender.
Sticky me. Eh, heh!
Hey!
Ha, ha.
- Johnny Vang?
- Yes.
Where?
Hey, dude, why do you run?
Wait for me!
Get out of the fucking car!
- Out!
MAN: Get your own station wagon!
Get the fuck off!
Damn.
Fuck.
You taking it too fast with me.
- Which way?
- I want you to take it slow.
Which way?
'...
You didn't ask name.
Shut up a minute, for fuck's sake.
Where is he?
- Johnny Vang?
- Yes.
Motherfucker!
MAN: Baby.
Motherfucking Chelios!
You like sushi, Chinese man?
How the fuck
am I supposed to know...
what kind of "ese" you is,
you slanty-eyed fuck?
Check it out.
Sushi
Hey, Chico.
We can make a deal, huh? Mm?
WOMAN: Oh, yeah.
MAN: Come on. Come on.
MAN: My girl.
Eve.
Eve?
MAN: Here, baby.
Eve.
Eve?
Chev?
Hey, I need you to take your
fucking hands off Lemon now, man.
- Who the fuck are you?
- Who the fuck am I?
Who the fuck are you?
You know this guy, Lemon?
Lemon.
You were dead.
Uh...
-...
I'm so confused right now.
- What's that ticking sound?
- Yeah, what is that sound?
You're kind of weird, tick-man.
It's time for you to go.
- Randy?
- Randy?
Come here.
Not you. Babe, it's...
Who the fuck is that?
Some whore.
- Ugh!
- Fuck, no. Fuck.
- Look, she's helping me find my heart.
- What?
Go away. Come on, let's go.
Baby.
What?
Oh, you dozy cunt.
'Baby__ - Aah!
No.
We need his ass alive.
Chev Chelios,
let's save some bullets, dude.
Put that away.
We've all had a drink.
Should I duck?
Yeah.
Shall we bypass the formalities?
Of course.
Who do you work for, and what
the fuck do they want with me?
El Hurén.
English. Who's the fucking El Huton?
It's The Ferret.
He wants you alive,
so he can watch you die.
Qh, yeah?
- Why?
- I don't know.
Doesn't everybody?
Shutup.
Ooh, you lucky bastard.
Eve, let's go.
Che... Che...
Chev Chelios.
Get on the floor now!
Turn around.
OFFICER 1: Oh, it's on now.
- No! Stop! Stop!
OFFICER 2: Put her down.
Stop it!
No!
Ugh.
Why didn't you call me?
Like fuck I didn't.
Didn't you get my message?
No. Where have you been
for the last three months?
I thought you were dead.
I fell a mile out of a helicopter,
that's all. True story.
No way. You know what?
That's totally possible.
I saw this video on YouTube...
where this guy's parachute doesn't
open, he falls 14,000 feet...
and he lives.
Yes, baby, I know it's possible,
because I fucking did it!
- Quit it.
- Since when were you on the Internet?
A lot of things have changed
since you died.
I didn't fucking die.
Well, that's besides the point,
isn't it? Aah!
CHEV : Hey!
Hey! Aah!
- Where are we going, Chev?
- I don't know.
I need to find that slob from the club,
the one with the red cooler.
Are you talking about Johnny Vang?
- You know Johnny Vang?
- I know his ass.
He's got the box with him all the time.
That box, I need it.
I can bet on my grandma's coochie
he's at the horse track.
Dude, you gonna put Johnny Vang
onioe?
- Maybe.
- That's so fucking sexy.
- Fucking dead.
- Didn't they cuff you?
Ugh. Damn it. Do me.
STRIPPER: I'll do you.
Ugh! Oof.
Bitch.
Atta girl. I gotta call Doc.
I need that cell phone.
Why didn't you just say it?
I have a cell phone.
Here.
You got a cell phone.
I got you, okay?
You gotta work for the things that...
Chevy?
CHEV :
I lost the belt battery.
- How long ago?
- Over an
Jesus Christ. That's not fucking
possible, Chevy. You should be d...
Fuck it. Never mind. Look.
It's a wireless system, so any low-level
electrical shock to your skin...
should juice it at least temporarily.
Hey, Chev?
I'm a certified heart surgeon.
Well, I was.
Lost my license after I fucked up
my ex-wife's...
vaginal rejuvenation procedure.
The point is, if you can get your heart,
I'm sure I can put it back in for you.
I'll be in touch when I find that Chinese
cocksucker that's got me pump.
WOMAN :
Bet you even had to choose...
Chinese.
MAN :
I just shut down, okay?
Hey, Chocolate? Would you get
off your fat ass and get dressed?
Why?
Is Doc Miles gonna
have to choke a bitch?
WOMAN : You know that I
was waiting for those results too?
MAN : I needed perspective.
- Oh, you needed? You needed?
I think I know who we're dealing with.
ALL :
Hell no, we won't blow.
Move! Jesus. Shit.
What the fuck!
Shit.
That's right. You're gonna pay me!
We want to make a living.
You carry weapons,
we carry weapons in our pants.
We're sick and tired of this.
Pay me my fucking wages,
motherfuckers.
Dropping loads
all over your silly wages!
They need their money.
You want me to fuck this car?
- Suck my fucking tits.
- Get off the car.
I'm gonna bang that bitch
in the back.
Hi. MAN: Give me my money.
RON:
We're sick and tired of this.
Just because it's porn
doesn't mean we don't wanna do it.
This is a weird scene. We've got
pissed-oh' beaver. I'm in pursuit.
- Cunt.
- Ha-ha-ha.
Sit. Good...
MAN 1: I'm just making sure.
- He's doing what he's supposed to.
Well, he's gotta know who's in charge.
MAN 1: Dude, come on.
- He's gonna eat somebody's baby...
- Chill.
- You're gonna get sued.
- He's doing what he's supposed to.
Whatever. I wanted a cat.
Fuck.
MAN 1: See? Way better than a cat.
MAN 2: Whatever.
Who's this fucking asshole?
You pair of sausage noodles.
How do you sleep at night?
I'm from PETA.
This is animal cruelty, you fuckers.
- Give that back, you liberal freak.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Fucking shame on you two. I tell you.
MAN 2: That's $250.
- Pair of cunts. Press the button.
- Take it back.
- Hit him.
- Listen.
- Disgusting.
- Ah, morning.
Mom would be so proud.
- Sorry about that. Give me that thing.
- No.
Yeah, there you go. Go on. Ruff, ruff.
You don't press that button,
you're in the pond.
- I'm pressing it.
- Press it! Ugh! Ugh! Ugh!
Come on, what's the matter?
Fucking wake up.
- Make him press the button, you...
- Give him the fucking...
- What are you, fucking useless?
OFFICER: Hey!
Stop right there!
Oh, shit.
See? He lost it. I told you.
OFFICER: Get him off!
Will our insurance cover that?
- Get down!
- Cover your head!
OFFICER 3: On the ground!
OFFICER 4:
What is around your neck?
Are you fucking kidding me?
- Kawo?
- Ugh.
- Get on.
OFFICER 2: Down on the ground!
Kaylo, I thought you were dead.
My name's Venus. I'm from Hollywood.
Kaylo was my brother.
Brother? No shit.
Hey, what the fuck
did you hit me for anyway?
I have a condition.
FBT, Full Body Tourette's.
I can't control myself. Ugh. Ugh!
- Jesus! Fuck!
- Ugh! Ugh!
God! What the...?
Motherfuck.
Hey, listen.
I'm sorry about your brother.
I need to get
to the Hollywood Park racetrack...
and I mean right the fuck now.
What's the matter,
you hurting or something?
- Is that where they're at?
- Who?
The sucker that killed my brother.
You're Chev "the cheese" Chelios?
The sickest motherfucker that ever
vaporized a motherfucker, right?
- Yeah. That's me.
- Yeah. So when you get those suckers...
Get a grip of yourself.
It's already done.
- Huh?
- It's done
I already took care
of the ones that did Kaylo.
- But... All of them?
- All of them.
D-E-A-D. Brown Bread.
- Right Said Fred?
- Simply Red.
I see.
Don't look so gloomy, Elvis.
I can assure you
they did not die pleasantly.
No. You don't understand.
It's a matter of honor.
It should have been me
to avenge my brother's death.
Well, so long, Chelios.
My brain hurts.
There is one that I never got to,
on account of I could never find him.
- The one that calls himself The Ferret.
- El Hurén?
- You know him?
- No.
- That means "the ferret" in Spanish.
- Right. Yeah, I knew that.
Listen, you want to find the dude that
made your brother dead, you find him.
Chev?
Racetrack.
You're here.
That you, Chelios?
- I'm running on empty, Doc.
- Same here, buddy.
I'm gonna need to stick my dick
in a socket.
- I don't recommend that. But friction...
- Friction'?
Yeah. Skin-on-skin contact
creates static electricity.
You're kidding me, right?
Dude, the friction of two like objects
causes a transfer of electrons.
Probably ditched that class. I did.
Find someone to rub against.
It's gonna help.
Well, it's not gonna hurt.
Terrific race.
That's a great horse, mate.
What the fuck, man?
- What the fuck?
- You did it.
Mate, that was all you.
Yo, man.
Fucking Doc.
WOMAN: Hey there, mister.
Somebody stop him! Stop him.
Chev. WOMAN: No!
The horse! The horse!
WOMAN: Get out of there!
- Aah! Aah!
- Please.
Hey. Wait, wait. Chill out.
He's just had too many drinks.
I got him. Okay?
Go about your business.
GUARD: All right.
- Honey, let's go.
- My heart.
EVE: Oh, I love you too.
Honey, come on. Over here.
Are you okay?
Is it the Chinese poison?
Friction.
Doc said friction.
Oh! Chev.
Friction.
Friction?
- I'll give you friction.
- Unh.
Yeah.
- Babe, what are you doing?
- I know how this game works.
- Oh, yeah. It's working, baby.
- Okay.
Yeah. Fuck.
Keep going, doll.
Rub it, baby.
- Yeah, rub it.
- Fucking good.
Rub it!
Aah!
- Oh, my God. It's gross.
- Hey!
No.
On, baby.
Fuck, it's working, Eve.
Oh, smash it fucking good, babe.
Come on.
Come on, you motherfucker.
You fucking nailed it, Doc.
You fucking got it, doctor!
- I got it!
- Come on, doctor!
Come on, babe, let's switch.
Give the kitty some cream, baby.
Give the kitty some more cream.
Move your...
- Ugh!
- Whoo!
Fucking it!
EVE:
I fucking love you. I love you so much.
Eve.
S'tOp!
JOHNNY: Yo, help us out, man!
Door number 6.
Come on, man!
Fucking useless.
Yeah?
Well, you ain't no
Ralph Macchio yourself, Chev!
Go!
Oh, fuck!
Did I drop some change,
or did I hear a chink?
Qh, my God!
Fuck you, man! CHEV: Fuck me?
Give me the fucking box!
Fuck you, Chelios!
Get in.
Ah, Chev Chelios.
- Don motherfucking Kim.
- Heh, heh.
So you pull my lily-white ass
out of the hot grease again.
Please, don't thank me.
I don't think I shall. I'm not sure
if you're aware of this, Jeeves...
but your slant-eyed associates
have taken something...
of extreme value to me.
And I intend to get it back.
You know what you are,
Chev Chelios?
Tell me.
You are a shit magnet.
Your friend has the gay condition.
And now, where were we?
You were about to tell me
exactly who's got what I need and why.
You may have heard
of the name Poon Dong.
- Only in dirty limericks.
- The patriarch of our organization.
Said to be 100 years old.
Considered to be more god than man
by the Triad gangs.
But several months ago,
word had spread out...
that Poon Dong
had taken gravely ill.
And without a heart transplant,
he only had a few days left to live.
- I see.
- Of course, that was unacceptable.
Many would have given their hearts...
from their own breasts
to save the life of Poon Dong.
But not me. Fuck that.
But many.
Then word spread out
that there was a man...
who had a heart so powerful
that he was capable...
of surviving even our most deadliest
of poisons.
- The Chinese shit.
- Yes.
It was you, Chev Chelios.
It was your heart that Poon Dong
chose to replace his own.
One more question.
Who the fuck is El Hurén, The Ferret?
And how is he involved with all this?
The Ferret?
Ah.
Let's just say our organizations
have a history...
of, uh, conflicting interests.
I see.
Well, it's mighty white of you
to help me out like this.
Now, if you don't mind.
DON:
Who said I was helping you out?
My reward for returning you
to Peon Dong will be great.
- So this is how it is.
- This is how it is.
Chicken and broccoli.
- Dude, are you all right?
- Never better.
Fish Halman here, bringing you
breaking on-the-scenes coverage...
of an explosion of mayhem,
and lewd behavior...
that has swept the Long Beach area.
Our viewers may remember
a similar series of incidents...
which took place
three months back...
involving this unidentified man.
Police are now confirming
that today's events...
are the work
of that very same psychotic deviant.
Ted Garcia is standing by
in Hollywood Park with a live report.
- Take it away, Ted.
- Thanks, Fish.
I'm standing here
with a group of people...
Families, seniors,
and degenerate gamblers.
That are shocked and traumatized by
what they've witnessed here today...
when what started as a sunny,
Southern California afternoon...
at the races turned, without warning,
into a public, open-air porno.
Did you say porno, Ted?
Straight up, Fish.
I'd like you to meet Glenda Lansing
of Hawaiian Gardens.
Glenda says she had an all-too-
up-close-and-personal encounter...
with the suspect just moments
before the shocking incident occurred.
That bastard had his filthy hands
all over me.
Can you describe exactly
what happened?
I never saw a bastard
who wanted it so bad.
He put his filthy hands
on every part of me.
Okay, that's a little too much
information for this broadcast.
Can you describe
the man that assaulted you?
He looked like that fella
from the movies.
Ha, ha. The Tea Bag.
Tea Bag?
fella?
- Built like a brick shit house.
- All right, ma'am.
You know that kind of language
is not gonna fly on TV.
Oh. That son of a bitch.
He treated me like his hot little whore.
HURON: Explain to me...
how you let this motherfucker
get away.
He just, uh, went buck wild
and killed everybody.
But not you.
I just got lucky, eh?
You know the drill, bitch.
Do it.
Do it!
Now the other one.
You got yourself another chance.
I don't think you'll fuck it up next time.
Now go get yourself a Band-Aid.
And go get me
fucking Chelios, cabrén!
That's the last time.
The last time that son of a bitch...
leaves me with my ass in the wind
in front of 8,000 people!
- Oh, Lemon. Hey, hey, hey!
- Aah! Randy?
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?
It's about the dude.
What dude?
- The asshole.
- What about him?
He's on every channel. The guy's
a fucking psycho killer, baby.
Every cop in this city's looking for him,
not to mention the fucking beaners.
- The fucking Orientals.
- So?
So? So?
So the heat's on the street...
and that dude's
playing for keeps, baby.
I have no idea
what the hell you just said.
- Look. Lemon. Lemon, look.
- What?
I know we've all been down our
dark roads in the past, okay, babe?
I need my hair did, my nails did.
You ain't gave me no money.
Where you been at, Randy?
If I ever catch you with another bitch...
Well, you do got a big-ass dick
for a white boy.
Anyway, look, the point is,
you're my lady now, all right?
I don't think it's safe
for you to be out there with that...
- That sick fuck running wild right now.
- Ha, ha.
- You can say that again.
- Look, look.
Hey. Listen to me.
Here's what I think we should do.
- What, Randy?
- All right, I say we go to the fuzz.
We tell them everything.
We come clean.
- What?
- The fuzz, all right?
I mean, I'd kill this guy myself,
but I got two strikes against me.
- Let go of me.
- Look, baby.
All right? I'm trying to be cool to you,
but I will drop the hammer.
You want me to drop the hammer,
baby?
I'm in no mood today, Randy!
Lemon!
OFFICER: Freeze!
Hey!
Now, spread it.
All right, let's go.
Against the car.
Don't leave no skid marks, nigga.
Ride that shit, big sexy!
Put your arm up, son.
Eight seconds, nigga! Yeah.
Oh, my God.
- Hello.
- Orlando?
Venus! What is up, my man?
Where you been, man?
I ain't seen your ass since...
We was all of us broken up about what
happened to your brother. You okay?
- Orlando, I need your help.
- Venus, come on.
You my nigga. Can't get no bigger.
L.A. Underground,
we're like a family, man.
We a freak-ass family,
but we family, all right?
- We look out for our own. What?
- I'm looking for a man called The Ferret.
El Hurén.
Oh, shit.
Oh, great.
- Hydrated, man! Keep him hydrated!
- Step on it!
- Hold it in. Hold it in. Hold it in.
- Ha-ha-ha.
Fuck.
This is an ambulance, you fuckhead!
PARAMEDIC:
Keep hydrating those organs!
- Hold it in!
- Jesus.
What are you doing?
This is an ambulance!
Right, motherfucker. I'm aware of that.
I'm in need of emergency services.
Yeah, we have got a guy
in the back of the ambulance!
Get him out of here, man.
- That's one of Don Kim's blokes.
- This man is in critical condition.
- Get out of here.
- I'm aware of that.
I'm the fucker that put him there.
- Now...
- Okay, he's got a gun!
- You're my physician.
- Okay.
I'm in need of an external lithium
battery belt...
for an Avicor Total Artificial Heart.
- Might you have such a thing?
- We're gonna lose it, Bronc.
- Please, look, this guy is fucking dying.
- Don't worry about him.
He's not gonna make it.
- Now, about my battery.
- Yeah, uh, you said the Avicor TAH.
Yeah, we got it. But why?
- Holy shit.
- Chop, chop.
Okay.
PARAMEDIC: He's fucking dead, man.
- Do you mind?
- You ready for this shit?
- Do it then.
Turn the fucking thing on.
Feels like, uh, crack.
Yeah, but better.
You know, those things
aren't designed for strenuous activity.
Tell me about it.
- Stop the fucking ambulance!
- Dude, we got to go to the hospital.
Fuck!
Bing fucking Crosby.
WOMAN : Breathe out.
Raise your buttocks upward...
Come on, down with that doggie.
Down dog...
- Hello. CHEV: Doc, I'm close.
So am I.
Chev, can this wait a second?
I think I've found that motherfucker
that's got my organ.
I think I got the skinny on that Triad
geezer from my girls on the street.
Old news. I'll get back to you
when I have the tart.
Chevy, wait!
Chev Cheliosl Aah!
Fucking clowns.
Cunt!
It's completely normal
to be freaked out...
when someone has a gun
atyourhead.
- I would have shit myself.
- I still have nightmares.
PSYCHIATRIST:
Everybody has nightmares.
The point is, by coming here
and talking with me...
you made a choice
to confront your issues and lick them.
I can't even leave
my fucking apartment. I...
Every time I go up to leave the door,
I see the guy with the gun.
- I'm having a really bad day.
- Oh, shit.
Tell me you got epinephrine
in this fucking cart.
PSYCHIATRIST:
Think about it like this, Engleson.
Today is the first day
of the rest of your life.
You gotta go out and enjoy it.
Knock back a couple of beers,
hit a titty bar.
- Uh... Excuse me?
- Have some smelly snatch rubbed...
in your face.
You gotta get out there, man.
- Yeah. I've gotta do it.
- Mm.
I'm gonna go and tackle the world.
No, don't tackle the world.
Tackle a fucking whore.
Get your dick wet.
- Yeah.
- Dip your wick into life a little bit.
- Have some fun.
- Yeah. Ha, ha.
I'm gonna go out there and I'm gonna
floss my teeth with some pubes.
- Oh, now you're on it.
- Thanks, doctor.
- Oh, my pleasure.
- No, no, no.
The pleasure's all mine.
I'm done with fear.
My life begins today.
Fuck!
Whoo!
Ha-ha-ha. Whoo.
Hey, maybe we better call 911.
Where's my box?
Five more like that, and your brains
will be strawberry jelly.
You can't look in that box!
The key and the fucking combo.
JOHNNY: No!
- Do it.
- Unh!
That's better.
This isn't my fucking pumper!
What is that?
What kind of sick freak carries
something like this around in a box?
I am shocked to my fucking core.
You've got some deep problems,
motherfucker.
What the fuck is that?
Fucking gotta come back
and fucking gotta find out...
what the fuck is this?
What the fuck is...?
- Hello.
CHEV : Doc.
When you hung up on me, I was trying
to fucking tell you something.
Your heart was transplanted
three weeks ago...
into that Shaolin motherfucker.
- Fucking great. Now what?
DOC: I'm on
Poon Dong is still in L.A.
And if I'm right...
he's got what you need in pristine,
working condition...
beating inside his chest.
- Good. Where do I find him?
- Don't worry about it.
I got people on the street.
Good luck with that, Doc.
I'll try it my way.
Come here, you.
UP you get.
Okay, darling, one last dance.
Where's the fucking old man?
What old man?
Hey. Hey. I got 5 dollars
that says you blow me for 20 bucks.
Oh, stop. Stop right here.
Stop right here.
Hey, baby.
'...
- Hey, baby. How you doing?
- I'm doing okay, baby.
- Yeah?
- How you doing?
What you need?
You know what I need.
Come on. Come on, Daddy.
Fuck you, Chelios.
Tell me what he's like
when he's at home.
When he's home, he's like a ghost.
He just plays those video games
all day, all night.
- Video games?
- All day.
And you let him do that?
I mean, you did buy the games
for him, yeah?
Of course.
Why should I deny my son?
- How are you today, Chev?
- I'm golden, sir.
Your mom tells me that you've
been getting into quite a bit of trouble.
- Is that true?
- Yes, sir.
- Regretfully, that's true.
LUKE: What kind of trouble?
Fighting, talking back, pinching.
Pinching what?
Televisions, stereo components,
books from the library.
- That's not all.
CHEV: No, sir.
Also a till from a restaurant
and one car.
- A toy car?
- No, sir.
ABMW Z1.
Hey, sit.
People, people, all right.
I hear you've been having
quite a bit of trouble at school too.
Chelios.
Nothing I can't handle, sir.
- I have a lot of piss and vinegar.
- He's hyperactive.
Oh, shit, Mom.
You want to watch
your dirty little mouth, son.
- We tried giving him Ritalin, but...
- Chev?
I sold it.
With all this energy,
you've never thought about...
I don't know, trying out for sports?
- I like to run.
- Chev, where's Dad?
I never met the wanker.
He died before I was born.
What do you think he'd say
if he saw you acting out like this?
Don't know, sir.
If he were here now,
and he asked you:
"Why the bloody hell
do you do the things you do, son?."
- What would you tell him?
- Don't know, sir.
- Bored, I guess.
- Bored, he guesses.
- Bored? Bored?
- Shut up.
LUKE:
We're gonna take a short break now.
And when we return,
we are gonna find out...
what makes you tick, little man.
VENUS: Hey.
You okay? Wake up.
Wake up.
- Ah, ha!
- Ria, baby.
What happened to you?
- What are you doing out here?
- Oh.
What you out here for?
I'm looking for the man
that killed my brother.
Yeah.
I have to go.
I might not come back.
Give the girls kisses
and hugs from me.
I kiss and hug all the pussy.
You go kill cocksucker.
MAN: Some boyfriend
you got there, Ms. Lydon.
He lied to you
for six months regarding his work?
Which I guess wouldn't be such
a big deal if he wasn't a hired killer.
He made you a target
for the South American mob...
for kidnapping, torture, or worse.
He sexually humiliated you
in front of what...
I don't know, half of Los Angeles?
Twice.
Twice. And then left you there
to take the rap?
And now you can add an arrest
and a police record...
to a list of wonderful things
Mr. Chelios has brought to your life.
Help me out here, sweetheart, okay?
Because...
Because I'm a little bit confused.
Why the fuck do you continue
to protect this asshole?
That's a dicky question.
Besides, I don't know
who you're talking about.
I mean, I'd like to see you fall
out of a helicopter and live.
- What?
- Hmm?
It looks like you made bail.
- Great. Can I have my stuff back?
- Yeah.
Yeah. Just a...
Just one little piece of advice.
Wake the fuck up
and smell what's burning.
Fuck.
Hola, Chev.
I take it you're the greasy fucker
that's been hunting me all day.
The Ferret.
Some people know me
by this fucking name.
And many men have died
cursing the name of El Hurén...
as they choked on their own blood...
- ...and the blood of their families.
- Colorful geezer.
I was born with another name.
The name of my father.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Fucking hell.
And my father's father's.
We're all very sad.
And the name...
that I share...
with my two brothers...
Alejandro...
Ricardo...
Verona.
Oh, I can tell, while I dig, dig, dig...
that you had no idea
that there was a third brother.
Nope. That fact escaped me.
What I assure you of, is I would have
made it a fucking hat trick.
I got a trick or three for you, cabrén.
I'm gonna make you wish
that you was never a man.
If you want to kill me,
you get on with it.
What's the rush, Chelios? Ha-ha-ha.
I know someone
who's going to love to watch this.
You.
COMPUTER VOICE:
- You got the donor?
- Like you got a boner. Heh.
- Hey, baby.
- Heh, heh.
You always say you want
to be more spontaneous.
Uh-uh, cowboy.
- We gonna go back to my place.
- Ooh.
- Yeah.
- That sounds good.
HURON: Carlo never wanted
my money, Chelios.
He was too stubborn.
Wanted to make his own way.
Now I think he likes
what my money can buy.
The technology to keep his brain alive.
Not forever.
But long enough to watch you die.
Yo, Ferret. This ain't Roots, man.
Yeah?
You gotta be fucking kidding me.
You killed my brother, motherfucker.
Prepare to die.
Fuck you, Chelios.
This way, sugar.
Confucius say, "Karma's a bitch."
Uh-oh.
Hello, Ricky.
Why do we go on like this, Ricky?
Hurting each other.
COMPUTER VOICE:
Water?
Did you say water?
COMPUTER VOICE:
H2O?
Coming right up.
Chev Chelios. Chev.
RIA: Chev Chelios. Chev.
Chev.
Chev. Chev!
DOC: Cut the battery.
Battery's out.
DOC:
Paddles. Give me the paddles.
EVE: What's going on?
Chevy? Clear!
Fuck!
DOC: Shit! EVE: No! God! No.
What the fuck is wrong with you, man?
What the fuck?
- Ha-ha-ha.
- Jesus.
It's so hard to keep a straight face.
Sorry, Ches.
MAN 1: Stay on the marker!
MAN 2: Let's go.
MAN 1: Body parts ready?
MAN 3: Yes. MAN 1: All right.
Here we go!
- And... You set there?
MAN 2: Ready?
And action, Mike!
Andrew!
Go! Go, Lance! Run, Lance! Ha-ha-ha.
MAN: Action, Manny!
Dropping loads
all over your silly wages!
You think these muscles are free?
You think this cock's for free?
No way! No scabs, no crabs!
No scabs, no crabs!
I'm gonna bang that bitch
in the back!
I'm gonna bang your prisoner!
Dropping loads
all over your prisoner!
MAN: Look at Jason and say it.
Dropping loads
all over your prisoner!
Dropping loads
all over your silly wages!
Yeah! Yeah!
Fuck you!
I take it you're the faggot
that's been hunting me all day?
MAN: No.
The faggot.
The faggot. Oh, sorry. The Ferret.
No dough, no blow!
No dough, no blow!
Dicks like this don't come for free!
Huh? Lips like this don't come for free.
- That's what I meant to say.
MAN: Ha-ha-ha.
WOMAN: I meant lips like this
don't come for free.
MAN: All right, keep going.
- Oh, a horse.
- Aah! Ha-ha-ha.
What?
- I never had it that way before.
- Ha-ha-ha.
- Let us kiss for a second.
MAN: Okay.
Yeah.
And here we go. And action!
MAN: Water.
Fuck, you need a few mints.
MAN 1: Holy shit.
MAN 2: Unbelievable.
Yeah. MAN 1: Holy shit. Fuck.
That was fucking awesome.
- Let's cradle the balls on that.
MAN 3: Good job, buddy.
- I'm sure we got it.
- You good?
- Yeah.
MAN 2: Good job, brother.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
- Fuck, that was hot.
- Ha-ha-ha.
