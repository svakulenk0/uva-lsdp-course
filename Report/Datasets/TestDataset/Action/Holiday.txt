Mom?
When is the training going to come?
It's due.
It will be here soon.

Go and ask its correct arrival time.
To know the correct time, wait for the train.
It will be here soon.
- At least find out where it is!
Where has it reached!
Call him up!
It will be here soon..
Hello?
Hi, this is Virat's sister.
Yes.
- Where has the train reached?
Actually the train has stalled due to some problem with the engine.
Is my brother close-by?
Virat..
Yes, he is playing.

Go on!
Look behind you!
- What happened?
Captain Virat IC58664 reporting sir!
Damn!
Oh God!
Sorry, sir.
I didn't know I was standing on muck.
Let me wipe it off.
Good block, sir.
Sir..
The muck.. I, sir..
Sir, the train is signalling us.
Sir, you can clean this up in its bathroom.
Let's go, sir.
Let's go!
Let's go!
Hurry up!
Let's go!
Hurry up! Let's go!
'Your attention please.'
'Jammu to Mumbai, Soldier Holiday Special Express..'
It's here!
- 'Train No. 12472..
...Is arriving on Platform No. 5.'
'Thank you.'
Brother.. Brother..
Everyone's here except Virat.
Where is he?
- There he is! Look, mom!
Brother! Hi, brother!
- Virat!
Brother! Let's go!
- Let's go!
How are you?
- I am fine. How about you?
Virat!
- Dad!
Hello!
Dad, they are my friends.
He's Vishal..
Virat, we don't have time.
Let's go.
Yes, let's go.
- But my friends..
We are in a hum.
- Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!
Listen to me..
- Where are you taking him?
I'll see you guys later!
- Hurry up!
I'll talk to you later.
- Call me.
Where are we going, dad?
Yes. Bye.
- First let's get out of here.
Let's go.
?
Just come with us.
Get inside. Get inside the taxi.
Let's go.
- Keep the bags there.
Yes, over here.
- Get in.
Come on.
Hit the third gear, sir.
, dad?
Where are we going?
Don't you know?
Otherwise, why would I be asking you?
Shut up and listen.
We are going to see a bride for you.
The auspicious time ends in 23 minutes.
After 5:00pm the alignment of the stars will change.
And Shraddha period begins from tomorrow.
No one will introduce their daughter to you after that.
We need to see this girl before that.
Otherwise, you idiot will always remain single.
Mom, I'll go wearing my military outfit?
So what?
Let's go home, rest, eat, freshen up and then go.
You are not getting any younger, son.
A single day won't change my age.
Quiet, all of you.
Sorry.
- Hit the fourth gear, sir.
It's a taxi, and not an aeroplane, sir.
We've reached.
- Your destination.
They are here.
Hi.
- Hello.
Welcome.
- Welcome.
Hi.
- Hello.
Hello.
Your son didn't come with you?
He is my son.
His clothes suggest he has just returned from a battlefield.
Let's go.
- This way.
Let's go.
This way.
Please come.
Three wickets down at the door itself.
Hi.
- Hello.
Welcome.
Jai Hind.
Have a seat.
Please have a seat.
Oh.
You are late.
Look at this..
Couldn't help it.
The train got delayed.
Close the buttons at least.
- We couldn't have driven it.
Did you have any trouble finding out house?
No, not at all.
We needed to see the girl before the auspicious hour ends.
That's why we brought him here directly from the station.
Please Call her.
Yes, of course.
Call her.
Yes.
Saiba.
Saiba!
Sister!
She's Saiba?
Oh, thank God.
Thank you.
Saiba sings well.
What would you like to hear?
Any nice song will do.
Look at his clothes,
She's nice, isn't she?
Do you have her phone number?
“Her!" Already!
- Just a minute, mom.
Hello?
Hi, I am Virat.
Silence!
That boy has called.
Yes, son?
Uncle, I wanted to say that your daughter is very beautiful.
Oh!
- Beautiful.
But it seems that we have different tastes.
I don't think we will make a good match.
But I pray that you find someone better than me.
Sorry for the trouble.
Stupid! What's your problem!
Forget it!
I don't think he will never get married!
Why didn't you like her!
Give me at least one reason!
Not one, I have three reasons.
What? - What?
- What?
She plait is a metre long and then some.
That's not an excuse.
- So what?
Girls with hair longer than 6 inches take 1V2 hours to get their hair done.
In her case, she will take six hours!
I'll have to wait the whole day to go for a party.
Did I tell you?
Did I ask you to get me married?
Did I?!
Secondly..
She is very shy and timid.
Saw that?
She raised her hand on her father.
You should have been strict from the beginning.
“Hit papa! Hit papa!"
You got her into this habit.
And what's the third reason?
And the third reason is that I want a stylish girl.
An impressive girl.
She looks like she has just come from a village.
Hey!
What.
What are you doing?
Hey!
Why do you need so much money?
I served coffee to six people.
This is a tip for that.
Hey..
- Bye!
According the post-modem report.
This woman committed suicide by setting herself on fire.
Impossible.
This isn't a suicide.
It's murder.
Soles of who commit suicide by setting themselves on fire never burn.
This..
- Her soles are burnt.
Someone killed her, made her lie down..
Pour an accelerant on her, started a fire and declared it as suicide.
Your case is solved.
Just find the murderer.
You started already?
When I came to know that you are coming..
I thought of taking a leave and going to Madgaon.
But my luck simply..
My leave wasn't approved.
Just say that I trouble you.
Why are you beating around the bush?
Oh really?
I should just say it?
year.
Yes, I do.
You spend your days with me.
Yes, I do.
You meddle in my affairs.
Yes, I do.
Whenever I am about to get promoted to being an inspecton.
You ruin my chances and I get stuck at being a sub-inspector.
Listen..
I'll no longer meddle in your affairs.
Happy?
You won't face any problems.
Just a minute.
Here.
Solve it.
What's happening?
A sports tournament.
We're providing security for it.
Hi, Rocky!
Hi, Rocky!
Let's go.
Do you want to provide security?
Do you want to hang out with him?
Rocky is retiring tomorrow.
Today is his last day on duty.
He is very smart.
A few days back there was an article on him in the Mumbai Mirror.
What's wrong with his paw?
He broke a bone during practice.
Department doesn't need him because he has a broken bone.
So they are retiring him.
Strange, isn't it?
You are looked after only till the time you are needed.
From tomorrow he will be a street dog.
Can I take Rocky with me tomorrow?
Sure.
Fine. I'll take him in.
Fantastic.
- Bye, Rocky.
Security is perfect?
- Yes, sir.
Don't let anyone in without proper ID.
- Okay, sir.
Mukund..
- Yes?
There's a lot of beauty here.
Control your emotions.
I'm on duty.
Yes, sir.
Not so seriously. Control.
Beauty reminds me, we went to see a girl yesterday.
How was she?
Don't ask.
I got so bored!
Just don't ask!
Intercollegiate boxing championship is about to begin.
We first call upon, Saiba Thapar from St. Xavier's college, Mumbai!
She is very delicate.
V9"! Shy type, you know..
You know the rules. Box.
Come on, Saiba. Don't give up!
Come on, Saiba!
Saiba, you can do it!
You can do it, Saiba!
- Saiba!
Come on, Saiba!
Better focus!
I don't like this girl at all!
One, two..
Three, four..
Five, six..
Seven, eight.
Nine, ten!
And the winner is, Saiba Thapar!
You should marry someone like her.
Saiba! Saiba! Saiba!
Right?
- She is the girl I met that day.
No! No! Absolutely not!
Earlier you sought three faults in her.
Now you feel that she is the moon.
Mom, how will a phone call make any difference to you?
Your son will get a chance to settle down.
Try and understand.
Just one phone call.
Happy birthday, mom,
I celebrated my birthday last month.
And you are giving me a gift today!
That too a dog!
- Please, mom.
Consider it a belated birthday gift. Mom..
Your pencil.
Hey, make the phone call, please.
Just one call for your brother.
- No.
Please?
See. Happy birthday-
I hate dogs!
Both of you, get out of here!
Is this a joke?
He didn't like me the other day.
Now he likes me.
Will it do if again after marriage he says he doesn't like me?
Look, you got your first proposal when you were 13.
I've been getting text messages since I was 10!
Like you, I too have rejected many.
You know, I used to get loads of text messages when I turned 18.
Then as my age progressed the number of text messages declined.
Now the only text messages I get are from customer care and call centres.
Look, you should display some attitude but then you should give in.
Got it?
Anything you say won't make any difference to me.
Oh God.
You go to buy one article and you end up buying plenty.
To go shopping with your wife..
A person gets bored to death.
Please don't get married, Virat.
I am telling you.
Hey, this..
Kom..
Isn't she the same boxer?
Handsome.
He's hot.
Say hi to him.
He's the one I rejected.
What are you doing?
Look"
Hey!
I'll fall down!
This is a police bike.
I am on duty.
Hey..
Get down!
What happened?
- Get down!
Okay. Okay. Okay!
- How dare he!
Move aside!
Hey!
Why did you kiss me?
When did I kiss you?
I kissed my mirror.
This mirror belongs to me.
I can do anything I want to do with it.
The mirror might be yours but the face in it is mine!
Just a minute.
This mirror belongs to the government.
Hey..
- Hey!
I can do anything I want to do with this mirror.
I can love it, kiss it or break it!
Why just you?
I'll break it!
Just a minute, madam. No violence!
This is a public road.
So? He can kiss in the middle of the road?
And you?
You are a cop, right?
Why are you standing here quietly like a fool?
Let's go, Saiba.
- Look, ma'am, you..
Let's go. Let's go.
Let's go.
Aren't you ashamed of eve-teasing?
Let's go. Let's go.
- I'll break your jaw!
Let's go.
- Ifl see you here again, I'll kill you!
Let's go, girl! Let's go!
Get inside.
- Keep moving. Keep moving.
Keep moving. Come on!
Ask for boxer Saiba!
- Yes, we will.
Then you will know who I am.
Couldn't you have found a better place to romance?
Move on, man!
- Hey!
She has the keys to my bike!
So what? Push it.
- Push..
If only you wouldn't have rejected her..
My bike won't have lost its mirror.
Isn't she great, Makiya?
She took the bike keys while talking to us and we didn't even realise.
Not while talking, while verbally abusing us.
Tell me what did my depanmenfs bike have to do with your quarrel?
My purse! My purse!
Has someone seen my purse?
It contains Rs. 5000!
Has someone seen my purse?
Hey Romeo, something happening over there.
Someone has stolen it.
I had it with me.
- Come on, go ahead.
My purse.. Where is my purse?
It contained Rs. 5000 in it!
- Silence!
My purse.. Please. Please.
- You want your purse, right?
Yes.
- You will get it.
We are with the police.
No one will move from their place.
Stop the bus.
Ask him to stop the bus.
- I'll get down from the front.
You will get your purse.
Come on. Come on.
Come over here.
Ask everyone to get down one by one.
- Okay.
Hurry Up-
Come on everyone, get off the bus, one by one.
Everyone, get off the bus. Hurry up.
- Come on.
Come on.
- Everyone, get off the bus one by one.
This one?
- Come on, get down.
Is this the one?
- No.
Come on, get down.
- Leave. Come on.
Do I look like a thief to you?
This one?
- No. - You can leave.
Do one thing.
Go inside and check under the seats.
Yes, sir.
- Okay?
Go and check if it is under the seat.
Is this the one?
Look"
- No.
Come on!
Come on! Get off from the front!
Open her bag.
- She? Open your purse.
You will even check ladies purses?
No, it's not there.
Who's next?
- No. Not this one.
Some of you get down from here.
Yes, come on.
- Not this one.
This one?
Got it!
Got it! This is my purse!
I got my pugsgint it! e.

This is the one!
- Virat, we found the purse!
Hand him over to the police!

Virat! What's wrong, Virat?
Virat!

Why.. why did you need to run?
Why were you running?
Why did you run?

We gathered all the information.
We knew that we would catch him one day.
Very soon I'll catch all the terrorists behind this attack.
.
Mumbai is safe as long as I am here.
I have worked day and night and caught this terrorist.
And it's assumed, their aim wasn't to blow up just one bus.
They have a hidden agenda behind this.
And we need to find that out.
ViraL. Let's go and give an interview.
Let's go.
- Let's go.
Not there. Let's go this way.
'Sir, it's often seen that the Mumbai police..'
'..has been unable to capture the terrorists behind the blasts.'
'Even if they capture them.'
Instead of questioning him, they are giving him VIP treatment.
Let me assure you, I can die for the people of this country.
He's blabbering as if he is the one who caught him.
Actually, I should've been there.
But you dragged and brought me here.
Let me assure you, I won't rest in peace till this case isn't solved.
If I would've been on TV..
First of all, my mother-in-law would've been stunned.
I would've gained a lot of respect.
I would've become an inspector.
Very soon the will be brought before the law.
'Among those who died in the bus bomb blast included women and children.'
'According to the police, the terrorist caught, Aseem Lala, is behind it.'
'They also state that there can be other terrorist organisations behind it.'
'But this has still not been confirmed.'
'Police state that the terrorists behind it won't be spared.'
'Home ministry has recommended formation of a high level investigation team.'
'And also assured that the security is being tighten up.'
'Those behind these attacks.'
Patil, I need someone at the back-street.
Okay, sir.
He is here.
What is it?
- We were waiting for you.
Let's go.
Come inside.
This is Virat's house.
Do as you have been briefed.
Okay, sir.
You are all on unofficial duty.
Set your Walkies to a different channel.
What is it, Makiya?
At this hour?
They will be here tonight, for security.
Do one thing. Take your family somewhere tomorrow morning.
Just for a few days.
Why? What happened?
That terrorist escaped from the hospital.
What?
Yes.
He killed a doctor and two of my cops.
But how?
I don't know.
In spite of so much security.
You got him arrested.
So he could come here and attack you.
That's why they are here.
Don't worny.
Go to sleep.
I'll make a move.
Keep YOU!' eyes open, GUYS!
Rocky..
Yes, sir.
I have sent Tawde and Patil to Gate No. 2.
I have never seen so much security being given by police.
Hey!
Hurry up!
Catch him!
He must have gone straight ahead.
Sun/avanshi, where are you? Wait.
I am coming.
- Okay, sir.
Hurry up! Tambe, this way!
What wrong did those innocent kids do to you?
You know why did I sever your finger without first questioning you?
Because now I am going to ask you a question.
And if you don't answer me,
you know the consequences.
One question.
One second.
If you don't answer me..
Another finger.
Someone helped you escape from the hospital.
Who was it?
ACP Ashok Gaikwad.
So simple.
Who is it?
It's me.
What do you want at this hour of the night?
Leave. We'll talk in the morning.
I want to talk to you now.
Come on the terrace.
I told you to leave.
We'll talk in the morning.
Leave.
Look, your friend's picture.
The one you helped escape is a guest in my house.
Sorry I didn't tell you who I am.
My name is Virat.
Indian Army.
Not just that.
D.l.A.
Defence Intelligence Agency.
I am a specialist over there.
A secret agent with the army.
My friends who work with me don't know about this.
Not even my family knows about this.
Why am I telling you all this?
I am sure this is what you are thinking about.
It's because you won't live.
When we are at the border..
...our enemy shoots us and we shoot them.
This is what generally happens.
One day, in our camp, a man named Ashraf..
He was from Sholapur.
He just disappeared suddenly.
Even after searching for seven days, we couldn't find him.
We found him on the eighth day.
He was stuck at the enemy camp.
They tortured him for seven days.
They had gouged out his eyes.
They shoved a beer bottle into his rare.
And then, they broke that bottle.
They were very cruel to him.
We had taken his dead body to his house.
His mother was crying
and father was wailing.
His sister was screaming, yelling..
His family was in a very bad state.
But on the tenth day,
his younger brother joined the military.
We die at the border even/day.
...so that you can live peacefully with your families.
This is a locally made gun.
This is my gun.
If I shoot you,
I'll have to tell everyone why I did so.
Your family will express their disgust over your dead body.
Your kids will beg at the signal.
Your wife will sell herself on the streets at night.
And if you shoot yourself, it will be considered as on-duty suicide.
Someone from your family will get a job.
They will get the provident fund money.
Pension will reach home every month, on time.
Now you decide which gun do you wish to pick.
And yes,
if the barrel of this gun points towards me then I'll shoot you.
You are challenging a very big threat.
A shot was fired.
- The sound came from the terrace.
I think from over there.
- From the terrace.
I know that you and the ACP don't know everything.
'Juhu. Bandra. Dharavi..'
'Dadar. Bombay central.'
'Blasts at 12 places in Mumbai.'
When?
On 27th.
Time?
Looking beautiful?
- Very beautiful.
Came from Jalandhar and made a Maharashtrian fall for her.
Really!
- She is very smart!
He is naive.
You're looking gorgeous.
Thank you so much. - Congratulations.
Hi.
- Thank you so much.
Thanks for coming.
Listen..
Listen!
- What?
Come with me.
I have doubt.
Doubt?
Do you think this is a mathematical class?
Come with me.
I need to ask you something.
Please try to understand, I am getting married.
After some time.
Listen, my head will explode if you won't come with me.
Come with me, now!
Let's see.
I have plans but..
Excuse me.
Can you please hold this?
Let's go.
Congratulations.
What!
The college beauty contest that I won..
You lost but you were the second runner up.
Okay. Continue.
You have Hrithik, John and Salman's posters in your hostel room.
So what?
Then why are you getting married to this baldy?
Look, there are no more than 10 film stars.
But there are 30 crores girls in India.
So think practically.
The good looking guys aren't smart
And the smart ones don't look good.
Listen..
And what about those who are smart and good looking?
Beg, plead and get married to him.
Howzat!
What's troubling you, Makiya?
There's something that I cannot understand.
Try me. I might be able to help.
In spite of being a cop, I cannot understand.
How will you understand?
Why? I am a militan/ man.
Do you know the basic difference between a cop and a military man?
What?
As soon as someone says “Attention!”..
A military man stands stiff, like this.
When he gets shoot orders, he starts firing without thinking.
But it's not so with us.
We need to use our brains.
I mean if we need to catch a pickpocket, we need to think like one.
If we need to catch a murderer, we need to think like one.
And if we need to catch a terrorist.
You need to think like one.
No, you sometimes need to become a terrorist.
Oh, my God.
But in this case, even a cop's brain has stopped working.
Then how can you help me?
Still, try me.
I'll try to solve this to be best of my ability.
Tell me. What's the problem?
Fine. It goes like this.
The terrorist escaped from the hospital.
He did.
That very night a cop committed suicide in his house.
That cop was posted at the hospital from where the terrorist escaped.
Now these two incidents are related, this is what a cop thinks.
Now tell me what a military man thinks.
I think this isn't a suicide, it's a murder.
How can you say that?
Because I committed this murder.
Why did you do it?
Why did he help that terrorist escape from the hospital?
Escape from the hospital.
How do you know that?
The terrorist told me.
Where did you find the terrorist?
That day in the hospital, you..
What?
hospital.
Hey!
Hi.
What are you..
- Hi.
Can we talk...?
You don't..
Yes?
Can I marry you?
Marriage?
When did you get that idea?
This morning. 8:40am.
What happened at 8:40am?
My friend got married.
The most beautiful girl in the college.
But the guy she is getting married to is not at all good looking.
So, I asked her, why is she getting married to him?
She said sometimes some things don't match.
And you know how difficult it is to find a good guy these days.
So my friends too advised me..
And I thought that why won't we get married!
I hope you very well know that from the very beginning..
...nothing seems to match between you and me.
First I rejected you then you rejected me.
Now you are giving your consent.
- I am just saying yes.
Yes, but nothing matches. Right?
Do you smoke cigarettes?
Smoking?
Yuck, I don't do all that.
Anyway, it's not allowed in boxing.
Saw? But I like girls who smoke.
I like the fragrance of tobacco.
Oh yes..
It's not like I have never done it.
Sometimes, you know, girls, parties..
It happens.
Nice. Nice.
Do you drink?
Drinks? Alcohol?
Yes, red wine.
You know, good for the head, good for the skin.
Sometimes even vodka!
But I hate girls who drink.
I just cannot bear the sight of girls drinking.
I can't understand why do they drink?
Why are you crying?
You are saying this on purpose.
On purpose?
- I know that you love me.
Saiba..
Saiba, listen to me. I...l..
You..
I came here straight from the wedding.
I didn't even eat!
- I'll feed you.
I am just joking!
- Joking?
I am just joking, come on!
If you don't believe me then let's go
to the temple outside and get married.
But there's a problem.
Now what's the problem?
Because I was angry with you“.
I said okay to the next boy my parents introduced me to.
You said okay?
Yes, it's not a big deal to say okay and then say not okay.
But you said okay to him and then you said the same okay to me.
No, no, no.
The okay I said to you is different.
The okay I said to him is different.
He too is a military man.
A military man?
If we somehow convince him not to go ahead with this marriage..
Then our job will be done.
He'll be at the coffee shop at 12 o'clock.
Let's do one thing.
Let me accompany you.
Let's meet him.
You'll come with me?
He is going to come over here?
Yes. Please wait here.
Okay.
Stay here, I'll go inside and talk to him.
You stay here.
I'll go and talk to him.
Come inside when I ask you to.
Excuse me..
Excuse me, the gentleman with the flower.
Please turn around.
Turn.
Yeah?
Sir!
LC58664,
Captain Virat reporting, sir!
Virat!
What's going on?
You gave such a salute to me
that I felt as if I am on the parade ground.
I am sorry, sir.
The girl I am going to marry is coming here to meet me.
I have never been married before.
It's my first time.
I am a little nervous.
Hi...
How are you?
Stupid!
How do I say it?
Hi.
Hi.
Hi! Come, come, come.
Sit, sit, sit.
You too like me, that's what your mother told me.
Thank you.
Sorry. Saiba, Virat.
We are in the same battalion.
He is very junior to me.
Okay.
He keeps on making mistakes and hence keeps getting punished.
He is very scared of me.
Virat..
Sir! - Saiba.
Hello, madam.
Madam?
I've kept a get-together at the hotel in the evening.
A small party, you see.
- Oh.
You must come.
Yeah.
Virat..
- I'll be there, sir.
Thank you.
Now, it's 12:30pm.
We were going to meet 12 o'clock.
I'm very punctual.
I'm a military man, you see.
Of course.
So, we'll meet at the party in the evening?
Yes.
Virat..
- Yes, sir! IC58..
Not in a public place.
See you in the evening.
Sorry, sir.
Bye-bye.
Bye.
Virat!
Sir!
Is this how you were going to talk?
Sorry, madam, but you are going to get married to him.
He left. Why are you addressing me as madam?
We love each other, don't we?
We broke up.
We started loving just an hour back.
Already break up?
Look madam, he is better than me in everything.
Do you know?
To complete a 400meter race I take 52 seconds.
He takes 48 seconds.
In high jump..
You know I can jump 6 feet high.
He jumps 6 feet 4 inches high.
In long jump, I hold a record of 7 meters.
He has a record of 7.4.
In weight lifting he..
Am I selecting candidates for military?
I don't like him.
That's it.
You didn't like me when we met for the first time, right?
Then you started liking me, didn't you?
You met him for the first time today, so you don't like him.
You will like him in near future.
That was different and this is different.
He is my senior and I'll have to give this sacrifice.
And I am the only thing you can sacrifice?
Your phone's ringing.
It's yours.
Smart!
Hello?
Tell me, where did you meet that terrorist?
I'll tell you that later.
We need to do something important tomorrow. Okay?
Hey, Vi..
Strange!

What are you doing over here?
Don't you know why I am here?
Don't ever come to my room unannounced.
There's something called as privacy.
Once again I ask you, where did you meet that terrorist?
Here.
Hey..
He ran away from the hospital.
How did you catch him?
You remember we went to the hospital?
Then you went to sleep, but I stayed back.
I knew he would do something.
Hey, but..
You cannot keep him like this.
You'll have to hand him over to the police.
So that he can once again run away?
No. But we'll find out how many people are working with him and..
Let that to me.
Why are you injecting him with this?
Say something.
Why are you untying him?
Virat!
What...?
What's going on?
You ask too many questions!
And you are answering none of them!
Will someone tell me what's happening here?
What have you injected him with?
Nothing.
It's just Ketamine.
He will remain unconscious for two hours.
That's it.
And where are you going wearing this coat?
I'm going to attend a wedding.
My batch-mate is getting married.
What will you do over here?
You are free, so come along.
Come with me.
You'll get free food.
Come with me.
But you have untied his hands and legs!
Let's go.
- ls everything alright?
Yes, man. What do I tell you!
How's everyone at home?
- Yes. Fine. All well.
Sister-in-law is fine too.
My son has started going to school.
Hi, guys.
Hi!
- Virat is here.
- You are finally here, Virat.
Hurry up.
- You are always late.
We are getting late.
Hurry up.
Everyone has been waiting for you.
Hi! Hi!

What about your marriage?
I heard something went wrong.
Yes, there was confusion during our first meeting.
So we broke it off.
What do I say?
Who is he?
Oh, he.. I forgot.
He's my friend..
- Mukund Deshmukh.
Yes, Mukund Deshmukh.
Sub-inspector of police.
Bandra East.
- Hi.
Joel, will you take Sarah as your wedding wife?
Yes. With God's help.
Sarah..
- Yes?
Will you take Joel as your wedding husband?
Yes. With God's help.
?
- Look at the time..
Guys, the bridegroom is calling you.
Come, guys.
Come and join us.
Let's go. He is calling us.
- Come on.
Congratulations.
Your love story was successful.
- Thanks, Virat.
Hi, Virat.
Hi, Siddhanh.
Let's get a group photograph clicked.
Come on.
Come on. Come on.
- Congratulations, Sarah.
Thank you so much.
You will know once you go there?
What are you doing?
Alright, GUYS-
He's saying something.
- Listen. Listen.
Virat is saying something.
It's been a long time.
Let's play a game.
What do you say?
A game?
Come on, man!
He wants to play games in the camp, when the train stops.
And now even at a wedding, he wants to play a game.
This is a real game.
Real game?!
Yes.
Fine, then the six of us will be one team and you six be the other.
What do you say?
All of us are in one team.
All of us in one team?
- Yes.
There is no opponent?
But what are the rules?
I'll tell that later.
Fine. But after winning, you'll give all of us a party.
Yes. - Yes.
- You'll have to give a party.
Okay.
Okay, let's go.
Guys, pay attention.
This is a little serious game.
You will soon know who our opponents are.
Can you see my house?
Look at it very carefully.
In two minutes, a guy will come out from the backdoor.
The 12 of us will follow him.
Understood?
- Yes.
After that when he meets another person we team will get divided into two.
Six people will follow the guy who will just come outside.
And six people will follow the guy he meets.
As these people keep meeting different people,
our keep will keep getting divided.
Did you all understand?
- Yes.
Very good.
Remember, your cell phones should always be on.
Don't answer anyone's call except mine.
We 12 will have a conference call and stay connected.
Okay?
- Yes. - Okay.
Let's wait for the man now.
He'll be here soon.
Is that him?
- That's the guy. Yeah.
This is very risky.
It will be more risky if we don't do anything.
Stan the car and follow him.
Where did he go?
- He was just here.
Where is he? We've lost him.
Where is he?
- There he is!
Over there. Over there.
Drive slowly.
He got into a rickshaw.
Vishal, note the number.
M I-I-O3-AA-6221 .
He's accomplice is here. Look..
Drive slowly.
What will we do if those 12 people don't split up?
They will have to, because they a job to finish at 12 places.
Stop the car.
Come on, boys.
- Come, come, come.
You all six.. Follow him.
Let's go. Move.
We are following him.
Keep following him.
Copy that.
Move. Move.
Stay on the line.
He's meeting another guy.
Stay alert Stay alert
All of you split.
We are following.
Copy that.
You follow him.
How many so far?
We are following the first guy.
- We are following the second guy.
We are following the new one.
Keep following.
He's walking right in front of me.
Stay alert
- Copy that.
Virat, we are following the first guy.
Another guy has joined.
Get in the train.
We are in the train.
Virat, they are splitting up.
Stay there.
Okay. Well done.
Virat, Goregaon Station.
Wait for the high point.
The first guy is meeting a cell phone dealer.
Now they are separate.
You follow him.
He's meeting another guy.
All of you split.
Split now!
They are splitting up.
You follow him.
Stay connected.
It's target at sight.
I'm following the new one.
There is one for each of us now.
Virat, I'm at Dockyard Road.
Masjid Bandar.
.
I'm at Dharavi.
I'm at Matunga.
Virat, he has gotten into a bus.
He's getting inside a mall.
- Yes.
I'm right behind him.
I'm at Bandra.
.
I'm at Chembur.
I'm at Kurla.
Guys, we are 12 people for those 12 guys.
The game is going to end now.
I have kept something in your bags.
Check it out.
It's a gun.
Hey, it contains a gun.
It contains a gun.
Virat, this is a gun.
No one needs to panic.
I have placed that gun there.
There's a bomb in the bag of the guy you are following.
He's not an ordinary guy.
He has killed innocent women and children in our country.
He's a damn terrorist.
We need to do what we do at the border.
To keep a bomb at four places at the same time..
To cause serial blasts in train..
We too know their technique.
We need to show them that.
There shouldn't be a difference of even a second.
Shoot them at the same time.
Ready, get set, boys.
Yes.
We will do it.
Yes.
We will do it.
Three..
Two..
One..
Shoot!
He's dead. I've left.
We'll do that.
When are you giving us party?
- I will. I will.
What have you done!
- Finished. End.
The dead body found at 11 places and the one found here..
They are sleeper cells.
They are even claimed to be terrorists.
They even found bombs in their bags.
According to the police..
All the cell phones found on sleeper cells are of high technology.
Looking at the magnitude of the preparations of these sleeper cells..
...one thing is for certain that Mumbai has been saved from a major disaster.
At the moment the biggest threat to this world are the sleeper cells.
What are they?
And who are they?
Look, in a terrorist world, these sleeper cells..
...are the one whose activities are most secretive.
Like the 12 men who were killed were kind of sleeper cells..
Yet they stayed among the common man..
...and prepared themselves for an attack.
The most important question.
Do these sleeper cells belong to a particular religion?
It's not always that they are related to religion.
When a country or a group want to plan a terrorist in our country“
They find people who hold a grudge, a feeling of revenge towards the government.
These people are found and prepared to execute a terrorist attack against us..
And seek their revenge.
After the 9/11 attack, all the secret agencies had one thing in mind..
That they should rid America of sleeper cells.
And they got rid of them in such a way that after the 9/11 attack..
...no attack of that kind or magnitude took place again in America.
Navin Chandra, Age: 29, killed in a BEST Bus.
Afsar Ali, Age: 31, killed at the Mumbai Central ST Stand.
Mother, look father!
Mother!
Mother! Look father!
Mother! Father's photo!
Mother! Look father!
Mother! Look father!
Look mother, father..
Who did this?
We still don't know who did it
Even the police have no clue.
Any clues?
Police has confiscated all their things.
Just one non-tracker phone has been taken by a shooter.
Whose phone was it?
Afsar Ali, who got killed at Mumbai Central, near the ST Stand.
I don't know who you are, where you are.
You have killed 12 of my men.
One of them was my brother.
I am coming to you.
When I find you, I'll kill you.
I am waiting.
Hello. Please come.
What's the height of this wall?
S ix feet.
They are excellent jumpers.
What was the speed of the bus?
Approximately 40km/hr.
They are good runners as well.
They can swim well too.
They have shot all the 12 people on their forehead.
A moving bus, crowded market, dark theatre..
Even from a distance of 20 meters they shot at the centre of the forehead.
They are trained shooters.
But they are not cops.
Was there anything common in these 12 people?
No.
But there was one thing common in them.
During enquin/ I found out
that these 12 people were wearing suits while shooting.
What did you just say?
These 12 people were wearing suits while shooting.
This is something you should have told me sooner.
I thought it's very common to wear suits.
It's very common to wear suits in America, but not in India.
So they are people who wear suit-pants.
They can be waiters in a hotel.
Businessmen attending a board meeting.
They can be software engineers attending a seminar.
Advocates, marriage functions.
I need a list of all the seminars..
...and marriage functions that took place in Mumbai on the 27th.
The ones with dress code suit-pants.
You think you are very smart.
Instead of killing those 12 people if you would've caught them alive..
...then we would've got some information.
It's of no use.
Because they never know what the plan is.
What?
- Yes.
Those 12 people didn't even know each other.
What are you saying!
These people are called sleeper cells.
Whether you call them their heads or bosses..
Can be one, two or three..
They make the plan together.
And then they find people who are ready to sacrifice their lives.
And the ones who are ready to sacrifice their lives are called sleeper cells.
That's why it's no use capturing them.
Because they don't know anything.
So till these sleeper cells don't get orders
from their boss they lead a normal life?
Exactly.
We won't even know where they are.
It can be our neighbour.
Or the one sitting next to us in a bus.
It can even be our courier boy.
It can be anyone.
So how do we destroy them?
There's one way to destroy them.
Kill their head or boss.
Once he is dead, their connection shall end.
And as the sleeper cells won't get any orders, they'll become dormant.
Just a minute! But how will you find the head of the sleeper cells?
Who said I will find him?
He will find me.
What?
- Because of what I have done.
We killed 12 of his men..
- Yes.
He will surely attack us to seek revenge.
According to my plan, he will soon show himself.
But in a big city like Mumbai, how will he find you?
We killed his men?
Right.
We must've made some mistake.
We must've left some clue behind.
He will come out to look for the clue.
If we find out what that clue is we can capture him before he attacks.
Then get thinking about what that clue is.
Move that colourful thing..
What is it called?
Cube?
Move the cube, they will help you find out.
Right?
Because if you have left a clue behind..
You won't answer this call.
No! Today you need to decide, friend or girlfriend.
Girlfriend.
- Good..
Hello?
Your sir has summoned us to his house.
Right away.
Okay, I am coming.
Hurry up.
- Yes, I'm coming.
Virat! What are you doing?
Let's go inside..
Virat!
Jyoti..
Remain seated. Sit.
She is Jyoti, my neighbour.
Hi.
She has been in love with me since childhood.
Sit.
After hearing the news that I am going to get married to you, she..
She was going to commit suicide.
We got her hospitalised.
It was a big problem.
Then I decided..
I am sorry, I will marry Jyoti.
I know..
This must've come to you as a huge shock.
I evoked love in your head, I made a mistake.
No more suicides.
Life is precious.
Now I have a question for the two of you.
Yes, sir.
You came here on a holiday, to get married.
Yes, sir.
Here..
And you wanted to marry a military man?
Yes.
Why don't the two of you get married?
But sir..
- Virat!
Don't act suspicious..
I loved her, but I never touched her.
That's by mistake.
Ask her!
Look, I can understand that it won't be easy for you to forget me.
Now what can I do?
It's not my fault that I am so handsome.
Yes, sir!
- Strange guy.
He stands up for anything I say.
Well, all the best.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you. Bye.
- Bye.
Thank you.
- Bye.
Come on, let's go.
Saiba..
Yeah?
Because we couldn't get married..
Never do this.
.
All the best.
Let's go.
Hurry Up-
Bye, sir.
“Let us shower some
spirits on the night.”
“Tonight.
- Let's just give into the feeling.”
“Tonight.
- Let's just give into the feeling.”
“Tonight.
- Let's just give into the feeling.”
What are you doing? What...?
Where...? Where are you taking me?
It's still..
the song is still playing.
“Blame the night.”
What's wrong?
Are you okay?
Your body temperature seems high.
Today is our first date so..
You know the rules.
According to that you need to give your boyfriend whatever he asks for.
That's why I am a little scared.
But I don't want anything.
You brought me to such a nice club.
You spent a lot of money.
I am okay.
I am happy.
Come on, let's dance.
Idiot.
Suppose if you had asked for a kiss on our first date!
I would have to kiss you, right?
Yes, you will have to kiss me.
Saw?
This is what I feared.
I want a kiss.
So, what should I do now?
Nothing, just close your eyes.
I'll do whatever needs to be done.

Damn..
Yes?
Listen..
I found the clue which he will use to find us.
What?
I'll find out everything.
Okay?
Hey..
Idiot.
But how will he know we left from the church?
There was just one similarity in the shootout of those 12 people.
And that's their dress-code.
If he is very smart, he will come straight to the church.
Of all the functions that took place on the 27th in Mumbai..
...the wedding in this church is the only event that matches with our list.
Because the one who got married is a military man.
Yes?
The name of the bridegroom is William Maﬂin Joel.
Can we get his address?
Yes.
- Please.
Yes?
Joel's residence?
- Yes.
We are from the army.
His batch mates.
Okay! Come, come, come.
Joel is on honeymoon.
Did you contact him on his mobile?
His phone was out of reach, uncle.
Oh! Hill station.
I am sorry.
Come. She's Joel's mom.
She's cannot speak.
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
Come, sit.
I have brought a gift for Joel.
Oh, thank you very much.
God bless you.
What will you have to drink?
No, thank you, uncle.
Uncle, can we have a look at Joel's wedding album?
Why not! I'll just get it.
That's great, madam!
You will give the address to any stranger?
Isn't it your duty to at least call his family and inform?
This isn't the time to argue.
Let's go.
Hurry up.
What do I say about.
- Let's get going.
No one is answering the phone at their residence.
He's Joel's school teacher.
And this is Joel's cousin.
They are Joel's batch-mates.
Uncle, there are five teams in this.
Yes, so far he has been to five camps.
That's why there are five teams.
Can I have a cup of coffee?
Oh yes, sure.
I'll just get it.
We got stuck at the last stage.
How will we know which team out of these five?
I will find out.
Boys, here's your coffee.
Thank you.
You returned so soon!
I couldn't find that medicine anywhere.
They are Joel's batch-mates.
They couldn't attend the wedding.
Welcome! Welcome!
Welcome!
I'm Noel. Joel's brother.
- Hi.
Sit.
Dad, did you give them coffee or something?
Yes.
- Oh great. Okay.
Thanks for coming, guys.
In which camp was Joel with you?
Kashmir.
Which year?
Joel was in Delhi in 2005.
After that he never sewed in Kashmir.
Can I see your ID cards?
Can you show me your ID cards?
Show me.
May I see your ID cards?
Dad! You are just too much!
You just let anyone enter the house!
What happened?
I asked them about work.
They don't know anything.
I hate smart people.
Show me!
Show me!
I need to leave a message for him.
They are smarter than I thought.
Why has these people circled?
Look"
To find out which one team out of these five shot those 12 people..
...he will pick one member from each team.
And he has circled those he will pick.
He is very smart.
Hello?
Hi, I'm Captain Virat Bakshi here.
Look, I want to tell you something.
According to our intelligence report your life is in danger.
Are you safe?
Yes, I am okay.
Are you sure?
Yes, there's no problem.
Please call me back on this number if you face any problem.
Please note down this number.
Okay.
Yes, Virat. I am fine.
Yes, I am safe.
Yes Virat, I am fine.
I'll surely call you if there is any problem.
What?
All those who were circled are safe.
That's the problem.
It's not as we thought.
That means they are planning something else.
That can be dangerous.
Virat. Amar Singh here.
Someone has kidnapped my niece.
When?
She went to the yoga class in the morning, but still hasn't returned.
They took her saying that we have sent a car from home.
File a complaint in your area's police station immediately.
. Nothing will happen.
Hurry up. Go.
Yes, Vi rat?
You cannot get any information by torturing an army man.
That's why they are kidnapping the girls in their family.
Bloody cowards.
Why?
To find out which team killed those 12 terrorists.
...they'll kidnap the girls and threaten the family on the phone.
They will blackmail them.
I'm sending you the numbers of the 5 guys..
...he had marked in the album right away.
Listen to me very carefully, Mukund.
Call them.
Ask them to give the numbers of all the girls that are not in the house.
Go to the control room..
...and check in which area are their sim cards travelling.
Okay.
Yes, tell me.
Where are you?
I'm going to the designing class.
Where are you at this ven/ moment?
Santacruz. Why?
These five mobile numbers..
Quickly track in which area they are.
- Yes, sir.
Hello?
Virat, my sister went for jogging in the morning.
Someone forced her into a car and left.
Yeah?
This number is not showing.
This.. Yes, Virat?
I was just about to call you.
Why? What happened?
Out of those five girls one girl's number is already deactivated.
And another number just got deactivated.
I too received a phone call 45 minutes ago.
They kidnapped another girl.
Virat, we need a big police force for it.
Their families have filed police complaints.
Please don't get confuse now.
What are you going to do?
I'll tell you.
First you tell me where did that second cell phone get deactivated?
Four kilometres from where she studied, travelling towards south-Mumbai..
Her sim card was deactivated in Byculla.
And the girl who went missing before her..
Her sim card too was deactivated in Byculla.
Okay. Do one thing. Leave for Byculla.
I'll meet you on the way.
Listen Virat, let's call and immediately warn the rest of the three girls..
...not to get out of the house alone.
Look, don't do anything.
Don't ruin anything.
That sleeper cells' head is more important than those five girls.
Got it?
Now quickly leave that place.
- Hello, Virat?
Shit.
Hello?
My sister went to college in the morning to attend a seminar.
The fourth girl was also taken.
Hello?
Yes! The fifth girl was also kidnapped!
Are you a human or a sadist?
Why are you so happy?
Five girls have been kidnapped.
You are not at all worried about them?
I know what is important for you.
Sleeper cells' head should come outside so that you can kill him.
Right?
Do you know what will happen if he is caught?
All the bomb blasts and terrorist acts happening in Mumbai..
...will stop for many years to come. Got it?
But the lives of the five girls who have been kidnapped are at stake.
Think about them.
Think about their family.
I am not concerned about anything.
Will you say the same thing if someone from your family is kidnapped?
I told you, it makes no difference to me.
Anyway, out of those five girls one girl is my sister. Got it?
All I know is..
...that that terrorist will keep all the kidnapped girls at one place.
We need to save them and also catch that scoundrel.
No, wait a minute.
In those five photos one boy's name was Sarfaraz.
I sent my sister in place of his.
Where are you at this ven/ moment?
Santacruz.
Why?
Do one thing.
Go to Rizwi college.
You know my team-mate Sarfaraz?
Take his sister's Scooty and come here.
Why should I get her Scooty?
Because I am asking you to.
Go and get it right away!
There's a 40% discount at Lewis.
Will you buy me three-fourth pants?
I'll buy you two instead.
Hurry up now.
Okay.
Have you lost your mind, Virat!
I just can't think straight.
I mean being her brother how can you do this?
Nothing will happen to her.
Not just her, nothing will happen to anyone.
Stop. Stop here.
What's Pinkie doing over here?
Brother, this..
Brother, listen..
This is Preeti's stole.
And get a maroon top for me.
There should be embroidery done over here.
And I want mirror work over here.
Okay?
Medium size.
Okay?
Bye. See you.
Okay, Virat.
I'll go and ask my informers.
Let's see.
Go!
Untie their hands.
Project the photos one by one.
Who knows him?
Who knows him!
He's my brother.
Go over there.
My uncle..
He's my brother.
Your brother?
No.
Your brother?
Project the next photo.
He's my brother.
Go over there.
Your brother is not in these five photographs?
No.
Show the group photos one by one.
Is your brother there in this photograph?
That's him.
He?
No.
He?
Yes.
Who asked you to drive the Scooty of the girl we were going to kidnap?
My brother.
Yes?
The operation is successful.
We know the team of those 12 people.
One member of that team sent his sister in place of another.
I've discarded the sim cards from the phones of all the girls.
He has no chance of finding out where we are.
No, no, no!
He is not a fool.
If he can send his sister then he must've found a way to reach you.
He will find you.
What are you saying?!
Kill the girls and vacate the place before he finds you.
Right away!
Tie these four girls!
Okay.
And bring this girl over here.
Hurry up!
Come on!
Come with me!
Set up the camera.
Bring them here.
Hurry up.
Make her sit!
Silence.
He is here.
He is trying to kill everyone.
Turn around.
Come on! Come on!
Don't worry.
Everything will be fine.
I'll drop guys in a taxi.
If cops ask whether you saw anything say that it was too dark.
You couldn't see my face. Understood?
Okay?
- Yes.
Come on, get into the car.
Come on, fast.
Purposely!
You got me trapped purposely, didn't you!
He was holding such a big knife over here!
A little movement and he would've severed my head!
We could catch him because we placed your life at risk!
You should have risked your own life!
Why me? What had I done?
Why? Can't you civilians sacrifice your lives?
Should only military and cops sacrifice theirs?
You just want to sit on your sofa and watch news channels.
And pass comments like..
“These cops should do this.”
“No, the militan/ is wrong.
They should do this"
You never want to do anything on your own.
What would've happened if I would've got shot in the crossfire?
What would've happened?
You would've lost your life.
What else could've happened?
Yeah, right, I would've lost my life.
when those terrorists who intend to kill thousands.
...are ready to sacrifice their lives then why can't we?
Think about it.
Now look, because of you that main guy was caught, alive.
He isn't the main terrorist.
Someone called him up and ordered.
After that he took out the knife.
What's this?
Nail cutter.
What are you doing over here?
That day you left in the middle hence I came here.
Don't ever come up from behind me and startle me again.
Why?
There could've been someone else with me in this room.
Sandbag, dumbbells..
You workout as well.
Not bad.
You know I read this in a forwarded message..
That 40 calories are burned during a deep kiss.
That's equal to 30 minutes of brisk walking.
You want a kiss?
Then ask for it directly.
Don't beat around the bush.
Forward message, science of construction, email..
These are vacuous things.
Anyway, I very well know how girls like you are.
You want it but you blame us for it.
“You know, you know, you know, that boy is so mean!"
“You know I just hate him."
Useless.. - “My mom.."
Now that you are here why just 40..
...let's burn 80 calories.
Or 160?
Or 240?
By morning we both will be sporting six-packs.
Not here.
Let's go over there.
Now who is concerned about the location?
I am.
Close your eyes.
If I close my eyes, you will run away.
I won't.
Who is it?
I told you! I think mom's here!
Go and open the door, I'll go hide in this cupboard.
Not there! Not there!
Not there! Not there!
It contains my knickers.
Do one thing. You hide here!
Hide in here.
Hey.. - HUT"! UP!
Hurry.. Climb up!
Just take a deep breath.
Did you watch the television?
What's the score?
Stop the drama.
I just saw what you did.
All of them were sleeper cells.
Everyone had perfectly normal jobs.
Now the difficult job is to convince their family.
Because none of them are ready to believe that.
This is what I expected from them.
Did you find out anything about the head of the sleeper cell?
I knew it! I was sure that you'll bring him along!
But he isn't the head.
We still haven't found him.
Oh..
Why is he coughing like a girl?
What happened?
Are you alright?
Another sleeper cell?
You aren't used to keeping books and clothes in the cupboard?
Say hi to him.
Hi.
- Hi.
You are going to marry him?
Yes.
Wonderful.
He's half mad. You are half mad.
Kids will be fully mad.
He's feeling shy!
“Wherever it finds you,
it worships you.”

This is related to the death of 12 sleeper cells.
The bomb blasts on 27th September..
He killed him because he didn't get any information.
The one you are looking for is one of these 12 people.
He is a cold-blooded murderer.
Instigate him.
Plan something big.
A powerful attack.
He will show himself.
Show him the power of sleeper cells.
Do one thing, mom.
Go ahead, I'll be there soon.
Hurry up.
- Yes, I'm coming.
Let's finish this game.
I want you.
Alive.
Call your team-mate Kapil.
He is at the R-city mall.
Tell him the building he is in is going to blast in 10 seconds.
Hey! Listen!
Hey, Virat!
How are you?
Kapil!
Where are you?
I'm out with my family.
But where are you?
R-city mall.
Kapil, take your family and leave that place right away.
There's a bomb over there.
Chocolate.
- Get out of there.
Chocolate?
- What are you saying?
Kapil, I said, the bomb is going to blast in five seconds.
Get out of there!
There are a lot of people here.
Inform everybody and leave!
Kapil!
Kapil, don't think!
Just get out of there!
Heard that?
How was the sound?
That's not all.
I know exactly where the rest of the 11 people are.
Because each one of them is being followed by a sleeper cell.
You want to check?
Monty Baggha, Juhu Beach.
Yogesh, Hanuman Temple.
Jigar Gill, COD Mulund.
Chirag Sethi, Mithibai College.
Sarfaraz, Sea-face, Caner Road.
Vishal, PVR Kurla.
Lalit, Phoenix Mall.
Sandeep Sachdeva, Andheri Market.
Church.
Virat Bakshi, Bandra Market.
And Siddhanh, Goregaon Station.
Now let me blow up the next one.
Virat Bakshi, who is at the Bandra Market.
There will be a blast over there in the next three seconds.
Three..
Two..
One!
Boom!
Got scared?
You got scared huh?
I didn't place a bomb over there.
I don't want them dead.
I want you.
I need you.
Okay.
You want me, right?
I'll come to you.
Don't harm anyone else.
Good decision.
Get ready.
How are you?
- Hello, Virat!
Great!
- See you later.
What is this place?
Who are they?
We all know those who die in border war and counter terrorism.
They are the army officers who are handicapped during war.
No one knows them.
In every field, if you work sincerely, you get promoted.
But only in army and police..
You get retirement.
And that's a shame.
Hi, Virat.
- Hi.
Even/things ready.
Hello, everyone.
Hi.
- Hi.
How are you guys?
Fine. - Good.
- Great.
I've already spoken to all of you over the phone.
The time we have been waiting for has come.
We are going to execute an assignment together.
Tomorrow morning, I am going to meet the head.
The one who controls the sleeper cells.
At that moment no one can follow me because they'll keep an eye on me.
Before meeting him, I'm going to insert a tracking chip in my body.
That chip will indicate my movements.
And you will be communicating everything to him.
Okay?
I've very secretly called for cyclonite explosive that we use in the army.
We will get it by this evening.
With that we will make C-4 plastic explosive.
After making it you'll give it to Joel.
Joel, you'll be in touch with Mukund.
Mukund, you keep telling him where they are taking me.
I am sure they'll take me to an isolated place.
No one knows why he wants me alive.
I am sure there must be a reason behind it.
Exactly 15 minutes after I meet the sleeper cells' head..
...that bomb should explode, Joel.
It is your responsibility.
Along with me, those who order sleeper cells will also die.
After that all sleeper cells will become coma cells.
They will never receive any order.
It's like a suicide attack.
Boom!
What kind of a joke is this, Virat!
You are talking about suicide and they are applauding.
What's happening, man!
He is a very dangerous man.
Fine. But why do you need to sacrifice your life?
You too have a family.
Think about them!
They too had a family...!
Those who were killed during the Taj attack.
They too left at night telling their kids that they'll be back by morning.
Hemant Karkare, Vijay Salaskar, Ashok Kamte..
Sandeep Unnikrishnan, Sashank Shinde, Tukaram Omble.
They too had a family.
Their dead bodies reached home.
Have you thought about their families?
He talks about family!
Here.. look at them!
Some don't have a spinal cord.
Some don't have legs.
Some don't have hands.
Some are blind.
But still, they are happy.
They too have a family.
An army man couldn't get a better opportunity.
When those terrorists who intend to kill thousands are ready..
...to sacrifice their lives then why can't we, the protectors do that?
Mukund, I came to this decision after giving it a lot of thought.
If you want to do something for me..
My family is a little naive when it comes to the ways of the world.
I have two sisters.
Whenever you can spare some time, do visit them.
There's just four days left the engagement.
And all of a sudden you don't want to go ahead with.
It doesn't need to happen now.
We'll see when I come next.
But we are getting married next year.
We were just getting engaged.
But that's not needed either.
First you said that you don't like me.
Then you said you like me.
And now, once again..
Do you even really like me?
Don't you understand?
I said no, didn't I?
Not now.
Will you be able to forget me?
I won't be able to do it.
My man is standing next to you.
Where is he?
He's clean.
Hello..
Can you see an Indigo car, 3525, across the road?
Get in it.
Straight ahead, black Honda City, 7087.
Take it to Bombay Stock Exchange.
You must be wondering..
Why haven't I still killed you?
What's my plan?
You don't know, do you?
I'll tell you.
The cars you parked..
Do you know what was in them?
I won't blow them up.
I'll inform the police.
Then the question that shall arise will be who planted them.
Then..
While the police will be looking for you..
I would've already killed you and your 10 team-mates.
Rather according to the police, to kill you..
And to defuse the time bomb at the right time.
Do you know who will take the credit of it?
Look at this.
Mr. Alwyn Dsouza.
Joint Secretary of Defence.
Not just that, the 12 sleeper cells whom you have killed..
The credit of that as well will go to the Joint Secretary of Defence.
And with that he will get promoted.
And he will become the Secretary of Defence.
Virat, there are sleeper cells all across lndia..
...except in the Indian army.
But with this,
we will recruit sleeper cells in the Indian army as well.
Then we shall do everything we want to.
'I'll anyhow have to get out of here!'
'I cannot die.'
'Sleeper cells in the Indian army..'
'It's like cancer for our country.'
Any death wish?
Any last wishes?
I don't want you to use your gun to kill me.
Did you hear that?
I, too, don't want to use my gun to kill you.
Hit me.
Indian army!
Uncuff my hands and then hit me.
What did you say?
Uncuff my hands and then hit me.
Listen!
You boss is hitting me while my hands are cuffed.
And when I asked him to uncuffthem, he's thinking.
You've already broken my arms and legs.
You have so many men who have weapons with them.
And yet, you are scared.
You should be scared.
You should be scared.
Now laugh!
Laugh!
Laugh now!
You are scared to uncuff my hands and then hit me, aren't you?
I like this fear.
What are you doing, brother?
Just shoot him.
Shoot him.
He's very clever.
Heed my advice, just shoot him.
You cannot defeat him.
I mean..
Uncuff him.
What is he doing, brother?
- I don't know.
They will fight each other to death, brother.
Order me to shoot.
- No! Absolutely not!
No!
I say you shoot both of them!
Shoot them!
We don't have any other option left!
Shoot both of them.
Drop your weapons into the sea.
Hurry Up-
You.. Give me my handcuffs.
My watch..
Come on..
You are not smart
Why?
Even if you kill me..
...that ship contains all the network details to control the sleeper cells.
There are people who will continue this.
Wait.
Three..
Two..
One..
Boom!
You didn't understand, did you?
You should die in suspense.
If he would've said he liked the girl the day he had come..
...we would got them married before he left.
It's the same here.
But no one listens to us.
This boy I tell you..
Sir..
- He will never be serious in life.
Take care.
They make a superb couple, don't they, sir?
You know, the reason they are together today is me?
You, sir?
Yes.
Sir, the day we came here and his father took him away in a hurry..
That was to introduce him to this girl.
He rejected her.
Then she rejected him.
And when they both consented.
Some idiot came in the middle and confused everything.
But now everything is fine, sir.
But sir, why did you say that you are the reason they are together?
The story you told me..
Sir.
The idiot you mentioned in it..
Yes, sir.
That's 'ME'.
Come to the camp..
Yes, sir.
I'll hang the two of you upside down.
No, sir..
Truly, army is great.
For the next 11 months, on a snow-clad mountain.
Or in a desert, making your own tent, cooking your own food..
Thinking about these 40-days holiday..
Keep looking at the family photo tucked in the wallet.
This is how you'll have to live, right?
I'll miss you.
- Take care.
