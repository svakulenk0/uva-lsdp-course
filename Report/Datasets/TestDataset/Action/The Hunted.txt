God said to Abraham,
"Kill me a son."
God said to Abraham,
"Kill me a son."
Abe says, "Man,
you must be putting me on."
God say, "No."
Abe say, "What?"
God say, "You can do
what you want, Abe,
but the next time you see me
coming, you better run."
Abe says, "Where do you want
this killing done?"
and God says,
"Out on Highway 61."
The Serbs have taken over
this... Albanian village.
They're killing everyone
in sight.
It's not a war,
it's a slaughter.
The Serbian commander is
in that mosque.
This is the third village
in a week he's destroyed.
We are to identify
and neutralize him.
We will proceed under cover
of NATO air strike,
commencing...
right... about... now!
Move!
I'm in the nest.
Copy that.
Raven is in the nest.
Cover fire, on my mark.
Three...
Two...
One!
Sergeant First Class
Aaron Hallam.
Yes, sir.
It is my privilege to present
to you the Silver Star,
one of our nation's
highest awards for valor.
Your bravery, sound judgment,
and outstanding resolve
are an example to all soldiers.
Your courageous actions
are the bedrock
upon which peace
and democracy
have always been built.
Congratulations, Hallam.
Hey.
What happened to you?
You stepped on a snare,
didn't you?
Easy.
Take it easy.
Be still.
Be still.
All right,
let me have that.
Nasty thing.
All right.
Next time you see one of these,
you go the other way.
Okay...
Here we go.
You're good, you're good.
All right...
Okay.
Now get out of here.
Anybody here
With the initials J.W.?
Yeah.
This yours?
Yeah, it is.
What the...?!
No more snares
on wolves, guys.
I got him.
He was down there.
What?
I saw him.
You need all that equipment
to kill a deer?
That's how we make sure
they're dead.
You guys don't look
like deer hunters.
When you kill with
your own hands,
there is a reverence.
Is that right?
There is no reverence
in what you do.
Where's your weapon?
Holy sh...
You're not here for
the deer, are you?
What's that?
You think you can hunt
me with those rifles?
Your rifles
against my knife.
What, are you nuts?
What do you think?
Yeah, well,
don't push it, asshole.
Where the fuck are you?
Come on, baby.
Oh, God!
You want a little
antifreeze with that?
It's not that cold out.
Maybe not to you.
Thought you were on the wagon.
Wheels fell off.
You running a fever?
No. I'm tired
of the goddamn cold.
Not too crazy
about the thaw, neither.
Well, get a
hot water bottle.
Keep you company at night.
I don't want
a hot water bottle.
I want to go down to California
for a few weeks,
catch some thoroughbreds
at Del Mar,
do a little fishing.
They say the yellowtail jump
right into the boat
this time of year.
Sam, the yellowtail's not
running this time of year.
Hello, Ted.
L.T.
How'd you know it was me?
I saw your pigeon-toed tracks.
What are you doing
this far north?
Van Zandt wanted me
to show you something...
personally.
It's been a few years.
Okachobi, 1 996.
Yeah, your agents got so scared
of alligators down there.
Remember that one guy
shit in his pants?
Mike Haney.
Yeah, that was funny.
You sort of disappeared
after that.
Yeah, I worked a few more,
and then I quit.
Been in Portland
for three years now.
We've reached out
for you a few times.
L.T., let me
ask you something.
Yeah.
What the hell are
you doing out here?
Working for
the wildlife Fund.
You went to a lot of trouble
to get yourself up here.
You know, you're
a hard man to find.
No, I'm not.
How hard am I to find
if you found me?
Van Zandt
thinks it's important.
He thinks
everything's important.
This one's different.
I don't do that kind
of work anymore.
Why don't you
have a look?
I really don't want
to go back there.
All we're asking you to do
is take a look, L.T.
Hey, Tom, can we get
prints off that paper?
Yeah, we sure can.
Please do, and
the door handles.
Harry, I understand that,
but I'm concerned
about the number
of SWAT agents.
I want to take
these guys alive.
Reed, we need to deploy
some of your men
on the other side
of the canyon.
I want to contain this area
and establish a perimeter.
That's your call, Abby.
We're here to help.
Bonham, are you all right?
No!
I hate those things.
I'm afraid of heights.
I'm Abby Durrell.
I'm the ASAC here.
I'm not sure how much
Harry told you, but...
Tell me what he told you
to tell me.
We'll take it
from there, okay?
Okay.
The two men were found
half a mile from here.
They were killed
with a hatchet,
then gutted in what looks like
a ritualistic fashion.
Every vital organ was cut.
I got a deputy talking
to the local Paiute chief.
There's no Paiute ritual
for gutting a human body.
The dead men were both
dressed and quartered
the way you'd quarter a deer.
Paiute are upset about...
Paiute wouldn't dress
and quarter
a couple of deer hunters
unless...
What?
He was going to eat 'em.
There were two men
killed the same way
last week in Washington State.
They were Forest
Service Rangers,
Which was how
we got jurisdiction.
Where are the bodies?
We sent them to the lab
yesterday.
You need to see them?
No.
You've got too many men
and horses in here.
All these tracks,
this is, uh... chaos.
Do they have a deer stand
or any coolers for packing meat?
Not within a five-mile radius.
Nothing.
You have a campsite?
Still looking.
What do you know
about the victims?
As far as we know, just a couple
of businessmen from Medford.
What else can we do for you?
Nothing.
Ask everybody to fall back.
Bobby, let's get everybody
out of here.
You guys, everybody, let's go,
let's fall back. Come on.
Let's go!
Yeah, everyone!
This is him.
Who?
The guy that did it.
At this point, we're not sure
how many killers there were.
Just one.
How do you know that?
He left a signature
right there in that tree.
Mr. Bonham, the deceased
were two able-bodied men.
-Mm-hmm.
-They had rifles
With sophisticated
scopes on them.
One of them had
a nine millimeter handgun
stuck inside his jacket.
Yeah.
Now, it seems
unlikely that one man
With a hatchet could possibly...
He didn't use a hatchet.
He used a knife
With a serrated edge on one side
and a filet blade on the other.
You're saying
that one guy with a knife
threw it at this tree and then
killed those two hunters?
Yeah. He wore a size ten shoe
with no tread,
almost like a slipper--
kind of like this one.
He's out there.
Oh, you're not going
out there alone.
That's the way I work.
Take this.
I don't need that.
Humor me.
The battery's fully charged,
so please make sure
you leave it on.
Okay.
You don't have a gun?
I don't like guns.
Well, how much time
do we give you?
If I'm not back in two days,
it'll mean I'm dead.
L.T.
Remember me?
No.
You taught me.
I taught a lot of people.
How come you didn't
answer my letters?
How come you're chopping up
all these people?
Did you see
the scopes they were using?
They weren't hunters, L.T.
They were sweepers.
You're going to have
to come in, son.
Move up.
-He's down.
-Down. He's down!
Stay back.
Don't touch him.
I found a weapon.
We see you!
D2, move in.
Call it in!
Move in!
Bring him in.
Clear it out!
L.T.
Harry.
You did a hell of a job.
Thanks.
He's one of yours, isn't he?
-Yeah.
-That's what I thought.
-He's our man?
-Yeah.
Any idea why?
No.
That'd be your job.
Would you like some coffee?
No, thank you, ma'am.
You don't have to talk to us
if you don't want to.
I understand that.
How about telling us your name?
We could start with that.
He knows my name.
Why don't you tell me
What happened in the woods?
Did you know
six billion chickens will die
in slaughterhouses this year?
What does that have to do
with what happened
in Silver Falls?
What if there was a species
above us in the food chain?
How do you think you'd feel
if that species
lost total respect for us
and started
slaughtering us, Wholesale?
I don't know...
but it's very interesting.
Do you understand it?
Oh, yeah.
Good.
What is it you want
to tell Mr. Bonham
you don't want to tell me?
I'd like to talk to him
about Operation Black Eagle
and Mongoose, Cobra...
Shut up! You want to get
yourself killed?
His name is Aaron Hallam.
Sergeant First Class
Aaron Hallam.
You do remember me, sir.
You're talking about shit
that never happened.
They're recording this, bud.
Good. Then there'll be a record.
And that record will never say
What you want it to say,
Will it?
Then what am I doing here,
people?
Mort, you have got
to help me out here.
Is this our guy or not?
I know there
are variables, Mort.
There are always variables,
but we can't indict a variable.
Hey, boss.
Sir, we understand you have
a man named Aaron Hallam
in your custody.
How much do you know
about Mr. Hallam?
Born in 1 968.
raised in Barrow County,
West Virginia.
High school equivalency,
although he scored
off the charts in science.
Joined the Army at 18.
That's the strange part.
What's that, sir?
Well, it doesn't really
tell us any more about him.
The record's incomplete.
Not even a date of discharge.
Sergeant Hallam
is unofficially listed
as missing in action, sir.
Unofficially?
That's a cover.
That means he's
still doing work for you.
We're here to take possession
of your prisoner, sir.
This is not a military base.
Your man very likely
killed and mutilated
four hunters on federal land.
I think you should take
a look at this... sir.
Unless we've been invaded
by a foreign power
and are officially at war,
you don't have
any authority here.
Look, I know you want
to get out of here,
but we're waiting
on the blood results,
and I need your statement.
You ever used that thing?
Do you mean
did I ever shoot anyone?
Yeah.
Would you ask a guy
the same question?
Yeah.
Well, as a matter
of fact, I have.
Do we have to go into it?
No.
Okay.
Not a great view of the city.
It's a wilderness.
What's your
relationship to Hallam?
I trained him.
To do what?
Trained him to survive...
I trained him to kill.
I trained a lot
of people like him--
you know, the best
of the best, shit like that.
I pulled your file.
You were never in the military.
No.
You just worked for them.
Yeah.
Like a contractor.
Yeah.
You don't like to
talk about it, do you?
No.
My father was a...
Army colonel.
When my older brother
was killed in Vietnam,
he decided he wasn't
going to lose another son
to that particular war.
End of story.
Dad was a tracker
before he joined the Army,
and I learned
what I do from him.
What about Hallam?
He's unusual.
He can kill anybody...
Without regret.
Most of the people he killed
never knew he was
in the same room with them.
How do you feel about that?
Well, I don't know.
I never had
to kill anybody myself. I...
I just taught people how.
In many ways,
Hallam is a fine warrior.
After a tour in Kosovo,
he was given another
sensitive assignment...
off the books.
He went too far.
A lot of innocent people
lost their lives.
Hallam's battle stress
has become so deep,
it is a part of his personality,
and it's impossible to reverse.
He's a killing machine.
There is no way
he can be indicted
or tried in open court,
or any court.
He cannot be processed,
interviewed,
charged with a crime,
or copped out as a psycho.
His picture cannot appear
in any newspaper.
As far as the world
is concerned, sir,
Aaron Hallam doesn't exist.
He's one of them.
They'll handle it.
You know why you're here, Aaron.
You wandered off the range.
It was way too messy, man.
You're supposed to be precise.
They weren't his family.
They were soldiers, Dale.
There was no backup,
no way for me to get out.
I was set up.
That's bullshit.
You fucked up.
Your actions resulted
in the injury and death
of unarmed civilians.
They had weapons.
Well, you know,
that's the problem...
you can't tell the sharks
from the guppies anymore.
That's what they're using now?
It's supposed to be painless.
Of course, he'd never
use it on himself...
Release him, Aaron!
Release him now!
You flying to Vancouver?
Yeah.
Then a connecting flight?
No. I drive.
It takes about eight hours.
That's right-- you don't like
flying much.
Must be worth it.
It's a very special place.
You ought to come up sometime.
I think you'd like it.
You wouldn't have to wear
two guns all the time.
I mean, your whole posture
would... change.
It's an open invitation.
Is it painless, Dale?
We need paramedics here!
It's going to explode!
See if you can help him.
No, I can't!
Somebody help that guy.
Does anyone know
what's going on?
Is anyone on the way?
Paramedic.
Are you all right?
Paramedic.
Okay, call 91 1.
I'm okay, I'm okay.
My buddies are in there.
Get 'em out, get 'em out!
I'm okay. I'm okay.
Okay?
They're coming.
Horrible, yeah.
Get 'em out!
Hello?
Oh, shit!
I can't hear you--
you're breaking up.
Please do not leave
your bags unattended.
All unattended bags
will be confiscated.
All right, now,
you go over there
-Okay, yeah.
-and I'll go over there, okay?
All right.
-Aah!
-Come on, come on, come on.
One, two, three,
four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, ten.
Ready or not, here I come.
...31 points.
It was only the fourth loss
in the last...
May I have your attention
please.
This is the last call
for flight 233...
In other action,
The 76ers 89 to 82.
Jerry Stackhouse scored
Hey.
...capitalizing on 14
second half turnovers
by the 76ers.
Alan Iverson who's been
hampered by injuries...
...all season long,
remains on the bench,
and it's still not known
when he will return
to the starting lineup.
Raptors' star Vince Carter
has also been nagged by injuries
all season long,
and can do very little
to help his teammates...
...seems bound and determined...
We have a breaking story.
We're going to our
correspondent, Jeff Gianola,
Who is live outside
the tunnel to Forest Park.
Jeff?
Ken, we have just arrived
on the scene
of a terrible accident outside
the tunnel
in Forest Park.
This is some type of truck,
some type of van
that was transporting people.
We can tell you there are...
Arm... drop...
...recover.
Arm... drop... recover.
I will teach you
how to kill...
quickly, accurately,
efficiently.
It will become a reflex action.
You will learn how to enter
a combat zone
and evaporate into shadow.
You will learn how to survive...
or you will not.
Ready?
Arm... heart...
Ieg, leg... Iung.
Reverse your grip.
Bring your knife on the inside
of his arm here,
sever all the connective tissue,
pulling his finger
away from the trigger,
and at the same time, coming
around his left shoulder,
grab the strap, choke him.
Now come into his heart
through the top of his sternum
and bring him to the ground.
Very good.
Go.
Arm, throat, heart,
leg, leg, arm, lung.
Good. Good.
Into the thigh here,
slice through that thigh
and the femoral artery,
into this thigh
and that femoral artery.
You will notice that
this arm is in your way.
It cannot hurt you.
The only thing this arm
can do to hurt you
is block the lung puncture
you're about to do.
Push this arm over
in front of his face,
go into his lung.
Now, arm, neck, heart,
leg, leg, lung.
One, two, three,
four, five, six.
One... two... three...
power assist four...
five... six.
One, two, three, four,
five, six.
One, two, three,
four, five, six.
One, two, three, four,
five, six.
Make this cut
a good power assist.
You're looking
for his backbone.
Here we go.
Go.
There we go.
Once again.
"L.T....
"I don't think
I can do this anymore.
"The nightmares
are getting worse.
"I think I'm losing it, L.T.
"I need to talk to you.
"I don't know
"if you've been getting
my letters, L.T.
"I need to hear from you
or talk to you.
"You've been like a father
to me.
Please write."
Once you are able
to kill mentally,
the physical part will be easy.
The difficult part...
is learning how
to turn it off.
At this point,
all we know for sure
is that we have three
confirmed fatalities.
We don't know whether or not
there were any other passengers
inside this van
when it crashed.
Access is very limited.
We have no new information from
either the police or the FBl.
However, the van appears to be
a military-type vehicle,
possibly the type of vehicle
used to transport prisoners.
We'll try to get some
confirmation on that.
Once again,
information very sketchy.
Rescue crew's still
on the scene,
along with FBl agents
and technicians.
We're getting no comment from
the FBl agents on the scene.
What happened?
Hallam's loose.
Hello, Irene.
Oh, Aaron.
You scared me.
It's good to see you.
I'm not listening
to you no more, Aaron.
Everything you
told me was a lie.
I've never lied to you, Irene.
Where have you been
the last six months?
Doing stuff for the government.
That's a lie, Aaron,
that's a damn lie.
Get out of here.
I don't want to see you again.
Aaron?
Aaron, you're back!
Hey, Loretta.
Hey.
It's so good
to see you.
I missed you so much.
How's my big girl?
Where have you been?
Loretta, I need you
to start your homework.
Can I visit
with Aaron some more?
You can visit with him later.
Are you staying
for dinner, Aaron?
Go do your homework.
Don't think
you're just going to step
right back
into our lives, Aaron.
I understand, Irene.
I don't even know
what you do for a living.
Did you look in my locker?
How could I do that?
You have
four locks on the thing.
What track is that?
A squirrel.
That's right.
Where's the nex one?
Um...
Bring it down.
Where's the nex one?
I can't tell.
Hold it flat.
See? Every nine inches.
That's the gallop pattern.
Every nine inches.
Oh, yeah, I see.
What's this one?
That's a raccoon.
How come you never see any?
Well, they hide
to survive.
Men don't respect
animals anymore.
They run them down
or kill them
any chance they get.
I think that's sad.
That's only Kitty.
Here, Kitty.
No, you don't want
to bother him now.
Why?
He's hunting, too.
Does he know we're here?
Oh, he knows.
How?
He can sense it.
She's so happy to see you.
Sit down.
What's this?
You got to leave here.
You got to get out of Portland.
What are you
talking about?
You're in danger, Irene.
Why am I in danger?
You and Loretta.
And they'll come here
and burn this house down.
What are you talking about,
Aaron?
House of Leader--
We got visual.
Copy that.
Stand by for intercept.
All right, sweetie, you
wait for me after school.
I'm going to be there
to pick you up, okay?
All right.
Is everything okay, Mommy?
Everything's fine,
honey.
I love you.
I love you, too.
See you later, alligator.
Bye.
The Leader's approaching
intercept, 6:.00.
Roger that. We got her.
Irene Kravitz?
Agent Durrell.
Is that your little girl?
Loretta, is it?
That's right.
We'd like to talk to you.
About what?
Oh, it's just routine, really,
but it'd be a lot easier
if we talked inside.
Uh, if you make us come
back with a warrant,
it won't be routine anymore.
Going somewhere, Mrs. Kravitz?
No, I'm just cleaning stuff up,
trying to get organized.
We're looking for a man
named Aaron Hallam.
Have you seen him?
Not for a few months.
But you know him.
This have to do with
his government work?
When's the last
time you saw him?
I don't remember.
A few months ago.
He... sort of took off.
That's the way he is.
Is he here, Irene?
What's this about?
What's Aaron done?
Please have a seat, Irene.
Nobody said he's done anything.
FBl wouldn't be here
if he hadn't done something.
When did you
and Aaron meet?
Eight months ago, maybe.
Stayed here a while,
then he just took off.
He tell you where
he was going?
Mrs. Kravitz, is he still here?
I said I ain't seen him
in months.
How many times
do I have to say that?
Excuse me, sir,
where are you going?
Irene, you wouldn't be
doing him any good
and you wouldn't be
doing your daughter any good--
What do you know
about my daughter?!
You want someone around
for her, I understand that,
but you have to look out
for her safety.
You have to ask yourself,
"Is this
the right kind of guy
to have around
your daughter?"
What has Aaron done?
We just want
to talk to him.
Did he kill somebody?
Come in.
You care about these
people here, Aaron?
You're going
to get them hurt.
You here to sweep me, L.T.?
You know I don't do that.
How do I know that?
They are coming for you.
They've been coming for me
for a long time, L.T.
You have to answer
for what you've done.
I have to live
with what I've done.
You can say
whatever you want.
I don't trust you, L.T.
If you cross this line,
you better be ready
to kill me.
Don't move.
Put your hands on your head
and get on the floor.
I said get on the floor, now.
Get down.
Get on
the sidewalk!
That's a silver star.
That is a sketch that
I made for a knife.
It's addressed to you.
"L.T., those guys you trained
to come and kill me--
they're not soldiers,
they're robots."
We've got a positive ID at the
river-front construction site.
We're headed to that location,
over.
This is Agent in Charge
Van Zandt, Agent Moret.
This is site foreman,
Hank Hooker.
One of our guys saw
him pull up over here
near that tunnel
entrance there.
How many men
work down there?
Maybe three dozen.
They're all coming up now.
Wait, we need an exact count.
I need a set of blueprints,
all right?
All right, this is an overview
of the site.
There's four major sections
down there.
He probably went down here
in the red section,
that's tunnels eight through 12.
How far does this
whole thing exend?
About 12 square blocks,
straight into downtown.
We'll cover the red section.
Only our people, Ted.
All right, show me the
other three entrances.
He went in over there.
There's three other
entrances here.
Make sure they're
completely blocked off.
Lock it down!
I got it.
FBI!
Step away from the column
with your hands up.
Let me see your hands.
I need backup right now,
red section, tunnel "A."
Did you hear me?
I said step away
from the column now.
Step away from
the fucking column!
About halfway.
-60.
-Radio's dead.
Shit.
Jesus Christ.
Bobby!
Leave it in!
Don't touch him!
Don't touch him!
Open his mouth.
Keep pressure on the wound.
Keep pressure on the wound.
Command Post,
this is Number Two.
We have an agent down,
sector red, sector red.
Get me them EMTs now ASAP!
Bobby... Bobby...
Bobby, listen to me.
Bobby, listen to me!
Sorry, man.
Hike!
Hike! Hike!
Number Two, Three-Charlie-One.
Subject spotted on foot,
eastbound, number two lane.
Hawthorne Bridge.
Close off both ends
of the bridge.
Two SWAT teams
on the way. Over.
Get everybody off the bridge.
Leave that car!
Excuse me.
Get down!
Let's keep this between us.
Don't get in the way!
Get everybody down on the floor.
Get down, now!
Down! Get down!
He's on the tower!
Target of opportunity!
He's on the tower!
Fire!
Cease fire!
Cease fire!
Hold your fire!
Captain, I need two or three
of your officers on each bridge.
Sweep the western sea wall,
and shut down
the bike paths. SWAT...
I need recon teams
on both sides of the river.
Sniper units to cover
each team's advance.
You can take your people
off the river.
The currents are strong enough
to carry him,
and the kid swims like a fish.
This is our show, Bonham.
This is what we do best.
How many people are
you willing to lose?
Excuse me?
He will kill
-as many of you as he can.
-Bonham...
You better decide now
what's an acceptable body count.
Knock it off!
You want more dead bodies,
that's what you're going to get
if you let these guys
declare war on my boy.
I made him what he is
and I can stop him.
We've lost two of our people--
best agents I ever served with.
Hallam belongs to us.
If you see a wreck in there,
let me know...
We'll get a vehicle down there.
If he's alive, he won't come in.
Right.
-Hallam!
-Get on the ground!
God said to Abraham,
"Kill me a son."
There's a man goin' "round
takin" names
And he decides
Who to free and who to blame
Everybody won't be treated
all the same
There'll be a golden ladder
reaching down
When the man comes around
The hairs on your arm
Will stand up
At the terror in each sip
and in each sup
Will you partake
of that last offered cup
Or disappear
into the potter's ground
When the man comes around?
Hear the trumpets,
hear the pipers
One hundred million angels
singin'
Multitudes are marching
to the big kettle drum
Voices callin',
voices cryin'
Some are born
and some are dyin'
It's Alpha and Omega's
Kingdom come
And the whirlwind is
in the thorn tree
The virgins are
all trimming their wicks
The whirlwind is
in the thorn tree
It's hard for thee to kick
against the priest
Till Armageddon,
no Shalam, no Shalom
Then the father hen will call
his chickens home
The wise men will bow down
before the throne
And at his feet they'll cast
their golden crowns
When the man comes around
Whoever is unjust,
let him be unjust still
Whoever is righteous,
let him be righteous still
Whoever is filthy,
let him be filthy still
Listen to the words
long written down
When the man comes around
Hear the trumpets,
hear the pipers
One hundred million angels
singin'
Multitudes are marchin'
to the big kettle drum
Voices callin',
voices cryin'
Some are born
and some are dyin'
It's Alpha and Omega's
Kingdom come
And the whirlwind is
in the thorn tree
The virgins are
all trimming their wicks
The whirlwind is
in the thorn tree
It's hard for thee to kick
against the priest
In measured hundredweight
and penny pound
When the man comes around.
