Five thousand years ago,
a fierce warrior
known as the Scorpion King...
led a great army
on a campaign...
to conquer the known world.
after a vicious campaign
which lasted seven long years,
the Scorpion King and his army
were defeated...
and driven deep
into the sacred desert
of Ahm Shere.
One by one,
they slowly perished
under the scorching sun...
until only the great warrior
himself was left alive.
Near death,
the Scorpion King made a pact
with the dark god Anubis...
that if Anubis
would spare his life...
and let him conquer
his enemies,
he would give him his soul.
Anubis accepted his offer
and spared his life.
Anubis gave the Scorpion King
command of his army,
and like an evil flood,
they washed away all
that lay before them.
When his task was done, Anubis
forced the Scorpion King...
to serve him for all time.
His army was returned
to the sands
from whence they came,
where they wait, silently,
to be awakened once again.
to be awakened once again.

Alex ?
What were you thinking,
a mummy had come back to life ?
I'll tell you a story
some time.
What are you doing down here ?
I told you to wait for us
up in the temple.
But, Dad, I saw--
No "buts." It's dangerous
down here, Alex.
But I saw your tattoo.
You saw what ?
On a wall by the entrance.
There's a cartouche
just like it.
With the pyramid and the eye
and the two kings
and everything.
Really ?
Yeah.
Okay, well, I'll be up
to take a look at that
in a minute.
In the meantime, I want you
to wait for us up there.
But-- But--
No, pick up your stuff,
and I'll see you up
in the temple. Go.
Go on.
And-- And what
shall I do ?
I don't know.
Surprise me.
Build a better mousetrap.
Okay.
While your mother goes
and desecrates another tomb.
Go away.
Those are poisonous,
you know.
Only if they bite you.
What was all that about ?
Oh, nothing.
Alex wanted
to show me something.
I swear,
the kid gets more and more
like you every day.
What, you mean
more attractive, sweet...
and devilishly charming ?
No, he's driving me crazy.
Now, where were we ?
Hammer and chisel.
All right, all right !
Let's do it your way.
Thank you.
Ever since I had that dream,
this place is all
I can think about.
Ever since you had that dream,
I haven't had a decent night
of sleep.
I feel like
I've been here before.
I know I've been here before.
Evy, nobody's
been here before.
Not in at least 3,000 years.
Except for these guys.
Then how do I seem to know
exactly where I'm going ?
Let's go.
Knock, knock.
Anybody home ?
You two check out that stuff,
see if it's there.
- I'll sort out the O'Connells.
-
You know,
if you move that fast enough,
you can almost write your name.
I just had a vision.
It was--
It was like my dream,
but it was real.
It was like I was actually
here in ancient times.
Well, if you
actually were here,
could you show me
how to open this thing ?
Hold this.
All right,
now you're starting
to scare me.
Now I'm starting
to scare myself.
What is this ?
Look at the state
of this rubbish.
Those Egyptians
never had a clue.
It's all chintz and stuff.
Look at that.
Cheap pottery, this.
Ancient rubbish.
Aaah !
Jacques,
something's hit me head !
Shut up, Spivey.
This place is cursed.
We do not want
to wake the gods.
Ohh ! Aaah !
Aah ! Aah ! Aah !
That's the emblem
of the Scorpion King.
He's supposed to be
pure myth.
No-- No trace of him
has ever been found before.
No artifacts,
no archival evidence.
Maybe they didn't want
anybody to find him.
Let's open this.
Evy, I don't have
a real good feeling
about this.
It's only a chest.
No harm ever came
from opening a chest.
Right, and no harm ever came
from reading a book.
Remember
how that went ?
We can't stop now.
Just remember,
I was the voice
of reason here.
For once.
Rubbish. Rubbish.
Dreck. Chintz.
Only half of this--
God, that hurt!
Hon ?
Let's do it your way.
The bracelet of Anubis.
I'll take care of this.
Oh, my God.
It's a bit late
for that !
Put it in your rucksack.
I got a better idea.
Let's leave it here.
I think it's a bit late
for that !
What's it say ?
"He who disturbs this bracelet
shall drink from the Nile."
That doesn't sound too bad.
Jacques's gonna make a nice
fillet out of you, my son.
- Oh, please. Please.
-Spivey! Jacques !
-Let's get the hell outta here !
-Come on !
- Come on!
-
-
-
Whoa.
This is bad, Evy !
We've had bad before !
This is worse !
Mom, Dad,
I can explain everything.
The Book of the Dead
gives life.
And the Book
of the Living...
takes life away.
I thought
that was my job.
We're getting close.
Did you acquire it ?
We're getting very close.
We've found him.
We've found him !
We've found him !
Step a side here.
Out of the way!
Imhotep.
It's him.
It's Imhotep.
Now we must raise those
that serve him.
Get out of my way.
Get out of my way,
or I'm gonna shoot you
in the face.
He means it.
He shot someone
before.
- Give it to me.
- The, uh, opportunity
passed us by.
We need that bracelet.
And we need it
before it opens.
Enough.
My dear Hafez,
I told you
I should have handled it.
I told you
I should have handled it.
I did not want
your past history
to cloud the issue.
We know where it is.
We'll take care of it.
No,
we'll take care of it.
I have a different chore
for you now.
- Where is the bracelet ?
- It's on its way
to merry old London.
Then London
is where we must go.
I think the bracelet
is some sort of guide...
to the lost oasis
of Ahm Shere.
Evy, I know
what you're thinking,
and the answer is no.
We just got home.
That's the beauty of it.
We're already packed.
Why don't you just give me
one good reason.
It's just an oasis,
darling.
A beautiful,
exciting,
romantic...
oasis.
Mmm.
The kind with
the white, sandy beach
and the palm trees...
and the cool,
clear, blue water and--
We could have
some of those big drinks
with the little umbrellas.
Sounds good.
Sounds too good.
What's the catch ?
Supposedly
it's the resting place
of Anubis's army.
See ?
I knew there's a catch.
There's always a catch.
And let me guess.
It was commanded by
that Scorpion King guy ?
Yes, but he only awakens
once every 5,000 years.
Right.
And if someone doesn't kill him,
he's gonna wipe out the world.
How did you know ?
I didn't. But that's
always the story.
The last known expedition
to actually reach Ahm Shere
was sent by Ramses the Fourth...
over
He sent over a thousand men.
And none of them
was ever seen again.
How did you know ?
I didn't.
But that's always the story.
Did I mention there was
a pyramid of gold ?
Twice.
Alexander the Great
sent troops in search of it.
Hooray for him.
So did Caesar.
Yeah, look what happened
to his career.
And Napoleon.
But we're smarter than him.
And taller too.
- Exactly. That's why
we're gonna find it.
- Because we're taller ?
Mmm.
That's why I love you.
Nice try.
Mom !
What do I do
with this chest ?
This sucker
weighs a goddang ton.
Alex,
watch your language !
Rather weighty, this.
-
- Huh ?
Evy, that first weird dream
of yours was exactly
six weeks ago, right ?
I think so, yes.
But what's that got to do
with anything ?
It just happens to coincide
with Egyptian New Year.
Oh. That's right.
What a coincidence.
Maybe.
All I'm saying is,
let's be cautious.
Oh !
If anything happened to you,
I would never forgive myself.
Aah !
You and Alex
are the only thing
that matter to me.
Well,
the Bembridge scholars
have been begging me...
to run
the British Museum.
Wh-- Whoa.
Oh.
Aw, cripes, how do you
get this thing off ?
Have I kissed you today ?
I hate it
when you do that.
Why ?
Makes me feel
like agreeing to anything.
Anything ?
Mm-hmm.
Those knickers
are not mine.
Jonathan.
Hey, Alex,
behave yourself
for five minutes.
You betcha.
Happy to be home ?
Couldn't be happier.
It's the year
of the scorpion.
Neat !
Thought you might
like that.
So then I killed the mummy
and all his minions...
and stole his scepter.
Oh, you're so brave.
And rich.
Did I mention rich ?
What do you think
I'm doing here ?
Sorry. We must be
in the wrong house.
You said
this was your house.
No, I didn't.
- Call me !
-
- You're not Sheila's
husband, are you ?
- No.
Look, if you work for Johnny,
I was gonna pay him back
on Tuesday.
I don't know any Johnny.
We are looking
for the bracelet of Anubis.
Oh, good for you.
Good thing to have,
the old bracelet of Anubis.
Where is it ?
Ah, you're looking here
for the bracelet. I see.
I have no idea
what you're talking about.
Mr. O'Connell,
you try my patience.
Mr. O'Connell ?
No, hold on a minute.
You've got the wrong ma--
Aaah ! That bracelet.
Now I remember.
- I lost it in a card game.
- For your sake, I hope not.
-
- It can't be.
Hello.
Hello.
Where's your wife?
My wife ?
Oh, you mean Evy.
I think she went off
to Baden-Baden
or Tibet or something.
The girl's
a free spirit.
Did I mention
I was single now ?
Egyptian asps
are quite poisonous.
It's downstairs.
There's a safe.
The combinationis, uh,
uh, 3-20-58--
uh, 3-9-3-something.
It's in a safe downstairs.
I told you. I told you!
- And your point is ?
- My point is, I told you
so you wouldn't kill me.
When did we make
that arrangement ?
-
-
- Uh, hello.
-
Jonathan, I thought I said
no more wild parties.
Well, when you're popular--
Alex, I'm serious.
If you've lost that key,
you're grounded.
I haven't lost it.
I just can't find it.
There's a difference.
Well, you'd better
start finding it then.
I will, Mom.
There's nothing
to worry about.
Good evening.
Who are you ?
What are you doing here ?
I'm looking for the chest,
of course.
Give it to me now.
Get out of my house.
Whoa, Mom.
Maybe not the best idea.
Alex, get back there.
Definitely not
the best idea.
I think it's time
to yell for Dad now.
- Now I will kill you
and take it anyway.
- I think not.
Ardeth, what are you
doing here ?
Perhaps explanations
are best kept for later.
Ardeth Bay.
Lock-Nah.
Knowing my brother-in-law,
he probably deserves whatever
you're about to do to him,
but this is my house,
I have certain rules
about snakes and dismemberment.
-
- Shoot him !
Aaah !
Aaah !
Whoa, Mom !
When did you learn
to do that ?
I have no idea.
That I learned
from your father.
- I'll take that.
- Whoa !
Not bad for a Medjai.
Let go !
- What's in the chest ?
- The bracelet of Anubis !
They must not get the bracelet !
Get it and get out of here !
Mom, look out !
-
- Evelyn !
Mom !
Jonathan !
Jonathan !
What'd you do
this time ?
I haven't done anything
to anybody !
Lately.
Come on !
Rick !
Evelyn !
Look out, Rick !
Dad ! Dad !
Are you all right ?
Yeah.
Yeah ? Okay.
O'Connell.
What are you doing here ?
No, scratch that. I don't care.
Who are those guys ?
Where are they
taking my wife ?
My friend, I'm not sure,
but wherever this man is,
your wife will surely be.
Hey, I know him.
He's the curator.
He works at
the British Museum.
Are you sure ?
Believe him. He spends more
time there than at home.
You're here,
the bad guys are here,
Evy's been kidnapped.
Let me guess.
Yes, they once again removed
the creature from his grave.
I don't mean to point fingers,
but isn't it your job to
make sure that doesn't happen ?
That woman who was with him,
she knows things that no living
person could possibly know.
She knew exactly where
the creature was buried.
We were hoping she would
lead us to the bracelet.
She obviously did.
And now they have it.
I wouldn't
get too nervous
just yet.
Is that gold ?
When I stuck it on,
I saw the pyramids at Giza.
Then, whoosh !
Straight across the desert
to Karnak.
By putting this on, you have
started a chain reaction that
could bring the next apocalypse.
-
- You, lighten up.
You, big trouble.
You, get in the car.
I am sorry
if I alarmed your son,
but you must understand,
now that the bracelet
is on his wrist,
we have only seven days
before the Scorpion King
awakens.
We ? What we ?
If he is not killed, he will
raise the army of Anubis.
- I take it
that's not a good thing.
- Oh, he'll wipe out the world.
Ah, the old
"wipe out the world" ploy.
Whom ever can kill
the Scorpion King...
can send his army
back to the Underworld...
or use it to destroy mankind
and rule the Earth.
That's why they dug up Imhotep.
He's the only guy tough enough
to take out the Scorpion King.
That is their plan.
Alex, I've got
a big job for you.
Stay here and protect the car.
I can do that.
Protect the car ?
Just because I'm a kid
doesn't mean I'm stupid.
- I know.
- Dad !
- Ehh.
- If you see anyone come out
screaming, it's just me.
- Maybe you should stay here
and watch him.
- Yes, now you're talking.
- You want the shotgun ?
- No, I prefer the Thompson.
If I were to say to you,
I'm a stranger
traveling from the east,
seeking that which is lost--
Then I would reply
that I am a stranger
traveling from the west.
It is I whom you seek.
How--
Then it is true.
You have the sacred mark.
What, that ?
No, that got slapped on me
in an orphanage in Cairo.
That mark means
you're a protector of man,
a warrior for God,
a Medjai.
Sorry.
You've got the wrong guy.
Mr. Hafez.
They found him.
Imhotep.
-
-
Do not be frightened.
I am not afraid.
You know,
a couple of years ago...
this would've seemed
really strange to me.
Lord Imhotep
will be much pleased.
Where is it ?
Where
is the bracelet ?
I think I know.
At the very top
of the gold pyramid,
there was a huge diamond.
Huge ?
How huge ?
It was so big,
it would reflect the sun
and wink at distant travelers,
beckoning them
to their deaths.
Get-- No! Get off!
Oh, my God.
You wait! I'll put you
in your grave again !
Our thinking was,
not if we put you
in your grave first.
Burn her !
You bast--
Rick !
Open it ! Open it !
I'm trying, I'm trying !
Meela !
- Hurry up !
- Come on, come on, come on !
Aah !
You broke it, you broke it,
you broke it !
Be quiet, Alex !
If there's gonna be hysterics,
they'll come from me !
Go, go, go, go !
Oh, no.
Not these guys again.
What are we gonna do ?
What are we gonna do ?
You're asking me ?
I'm only eight years old !
Honey, what you doin'?
These guys don't use doors.
Where the hell's Jonathan ?
Alex !
What's the matter
with my car ?
I was forced to find
an alternative means
of transportation.
- A double-decker bus ?
- It was his idea !
Was not !
Was too !
Just go !
It was too !
Was not !
Oh,jeez.
No, no !
Not my car !
Oh, I hate mummies.
Glad to see me now ?
Just like old times,
huh ?
Right.
Aah !
-
-
Ohh ! Ohh !
- Aah !
- Turn ! Turn ! Turn !
Turn ! Turn !
Aaah !
Yaah !
- No ! Get out of the way !
-
Look out!
Ugh !
Uh-oh.
Whoa !
Great driving, Uncle Jon.
Yeah.
You all right ?
This was... my first bus ride.
Huh ?
What would I do
without you ?
Are all librarians
this much trouble ?
Oh,jeez, get a room.
-
Let me go!
- Alex !
Silence !
Stop !
- Go !
- Stop !
Alex.
Please, do not fear
for your son, my friends.
They cannot hurt him,
for he wears
the bracelet of Anubis.
Alex is wearing
the bracelet ?
When he put it on, he said
he saw the pyramids at Giza,
the temple at Karnak.
And when they reach Karnak,
the bracelet will show him
the next step of the journey.
Well, if we don't get
to Karnak before them,
we won't have any idea
where to look for him next.
Seems to me like we need
a magic carpet.
When Lord Imhotep last
encountered the O'Connells,
they sent his immortal soul
to the Underworld.
As powerful
as he will become,
he is still vulnerable.
Only with the army of Anubis
will he be invincible.
He will need your help.
Keep this with you always.
Hey !
The Book of the Dead!
What a bright little child.
Your mother must be
missing you terribly.
If you wish
to see her again,
you'd better behave.
Lady, I don't behave
for my parents.
What makes you think
I'm going to do it for you ?
Silence !
Because your parents
wouldn't slip poisonous snakes
into your bed...
while you were sleeping.
Lord Imhotep
wishes to meet the boy.
Now we shall see
how brave you are.
Hey!
Watch the suit !
Hey !
Ow! Me fingers !
Nice.
Very nice.
Did you acquire
what we asked ?
Oh, we acquired it,
all right.
You know what ?
We had to kill two of
those guards at the mausoleum...
to acquire it.
This chest is cursed.
It says there is one,
the undead,
who will kill all those
who open this chest.
Yes, yes, and the creature
will suck them dry,
then become whole again.
We've all heard
this story before.
Yeah, but I heard
the yanks who found it
nine years ago all died.
Horrible deaths,
they were.
- So, with that in mind--
- We want ten.
-
- Quiet !
The agreement was for five.
Yeah, well, we want ten,
or we'll take it elsewhere.
If you--
Ten will be just fine.
Follow me, gentlemen.
Get in.
it is you
who are the chosen one,
you who will take me
to Ahm Shere.
What if I don't ?
What if I get
a little... Lost ?
You have strength,
little one.
You are
your father's son.
But I know something
you don't.
This bracelet is a gift
and a curse.
The sands of time...
have already begun
to pour against you.
Yeah, yeah.
I already heard this part.
From the minute
I put the bracelet on,
seven days do I have
before the Scorpion King
wakes up.
Did you also hear
that if you do not
enter the pyramid...
before the sun strikes it
on that very morning...
that the bracelet will
suck the life out of you ?
That part I missed.
Hey, wait a minute.
That means I've only got
five days left.
Then I believe it will be best
if we do not get lost.
Don't you ?
My dad is going
to kick your ass.
Mmm.
-
- I do not think so.
In here, gentlemen,
you shall receive
your just rewards.
No tricks now, woman.
We're not givin' up this chest
till we're satisfied.
Oh, don't worry.
There is much satisfaction
to be had.
-
- What's going on ?
This place... is cursed.
-What is it
with you and curses ?
-He ain't happy without a curse.
This is cursed.
That is cursed.
Give it a rest, will ya !
-
-
Christ !
He wants you to open the chest !
Open the chest !
- No !
-
Where'd he go ?
Where'd he go ?
-
-
Spivey !
This is the magic carpet ?
He'll be fine.
He's a professional.
- Izzy !
- Aah !
Hey !
He definitely
remembers you.
He's a little shy.
Jonathan, get our bags.
Oh, my hands are full.
Now.
Right. I'll get the bags.
I'll deal with
the flight details.
Honey, you're not
a subtle man.
We don't have time for subtle.
Izzy, come here.
Oh, no, no.
Doesn't look happy
to see you.
Never turned me down yet.
Whatever it is,
whatever you need,
I don't care.
Forget it, O'Connell.
Every time I hook up with you,
I get shot !
Last time,
I got shot in the ass.
I'm in mourning for my ass.
Remember that bank job
in Marrakesh ?
Bank job ?
It's not like it sounds.
Uh, it's exactly
how it sounds.
I'm flying high,
hiding in the sun.
The white boy here
flags me down, so I fly in
low for the pickup.
The next thing you know,
I get shot !
I'm lying in
the middle of the road
with my spleen hanging out,
and I see him waltzing up
with some belly dancer girl.
Belly dancer girl ?
lzzy, I think
you and I should talk.
As long as I don't get shot.
Quit your whining.
You're gonna get paid
this time.
O'Connell, have you looked
around here any? Huh ?
What do I need money for?
What the hell
am I gonna spend it on ?
I'm gonna keep this short.
My little boy is out there.
I'm gonna do whatever it takes
to get him back.
O'Connell, if you give me
that gold stick there,
you can shave my head,
wax my legs
and use me for a surfboard.
Didn't we do that
in Tripoli ?
Say, by the way,
when did you... lose your eye ?
Oh. I didn't.
I just thought it made me
look more dashing.
Come on.
Get to work.
You're not exactly
catching me at my best.
Oh, I'm sure I am.
I knew it.
I'm gonna get shot.
These are the commanders
of the 1 2 tribes
of the Medjai. Horus !
- Ah. Pet bird.
- My best
and most clever friend.
He will let the commanders
know of our progress
so that they may follow.
-
-
If the Army of Anubis arises,
they will do all they can
to stop it.
Rick, are you sure
lzzy's reliable ?
Yeah, yeah,
he's reliable-ish.
- Isn't she beautiful ?
- It's a balloon.
- Oh ! It's a dirigible.
- Where's your airplane ?
- Airplanes are
a thing of the past.
- Izzy, you were right.
- I was ?
- Yeah. You're gonna get shot.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
She's faster than she looks.
And she's quiet.
Real quiet.
Perfect for sneaking up
on people, which is
a very good thing.
Unless, of course,
we go with your approach--
barging in face-first,
guns blazing, and gettin'
your friends shot in the ass !
Why can't you people ever
keep your feet on the ground ?
O'Connell does not want
to believe, but he flies
like Horus towards his destiny.
Yes, yes, very interesting.
Tell me some more
about this gold pyramid.
Well, it is written
that since the time
of the Scorpion King,
no man who has laid eyes
upon it has ever returned
to tell the tale.
Where is all
this stuff written ?
Hello.
Got it.
Mmm-hmm-hmm.
Pretty nice, eh ?
This is all I have left
in the world.
The rest of my fortune
was lost...
to some rather unscrupulous
characters, actually.
But if the curator reacted
to it the way you say,
it must be very important.
If I were you,
I would keep it close.
My friend, the gods couldn't
take this away from me.
Hey !
- That's mine !
- No, it's not !
Keep your hands off fit.
Hey.
I want him back, Rick.
I want him in my arms.
I know.
We taught him well.
He's smarter than you...
and he's tougher than me.
I love him so much.
I just can't--
I know. We both do,
and Alex knows that.
I'll get him back, Evy.
I promise.
I know you will.
Are we there yet ?
Are we there yet ?
No. No.
Are we there yet ?
Are we there yet ?
Are we there yet ?
No. No.
No. No.
Are we there yet ?
Are we there yet ?
No. No.
Are we there yet ?
Are we there yet ?
No ! No ! No !
Are we there yet ?
Are we there yet ?
-
- Whoa ! That was amazing !
Perfect aim.
What are you talking about ?
I missed.
I have to go
to the bathroom.
Ugh.
Make it quick.
Ugh.
Hurry up.
- Hey, reading material.
- Now !
I can't go
when someone's watching.
I don't trust you.
You'll look.
Darn !
Oh, my God !
Doesn't anyone around here
know how to flush a toilet ?
Karnak.
Huh ?
Tsk, tsk, tsk.
If a man does not
embrace his past,
he has no future.
Look, even if...
I was some sort
of sacred Medjai,
what good
does that do me now?
It is the missing piece
of your heart.
If you embrace it,
if you accept it,
you can do anything.
Sounds great.
Listen.
- What can we expect from
our old friend Imhotep ?
- His powers are returning.
By the time
he reaches Ahm Shere,
even the Scorpion King
won't be able to stop him.
Anck-su-namun !
Imhotep !
Evy!
Imhotep !
Imhotep.
Anck-su-namun.
Evy, I know you haven't exactly
been your self lately with
all these dreams and visions--
No, no, they're memories
from my previous life.
Honestly,
I'm not losing my mind.
It all makes perfect sense now.
And that's the reason why
we found the bracelet ?
Exactly.
I was its protector.
Now do you believe, my friend?
Clearly, you were destined
to protect this woman.
Right.
She's a reincarnated princess,
and I'm a warrior for God.
And your son leads the way
to Ahm Shere.
Three sides of the pyramid.
This was all preordained
thousands of years ago.
And how does the story end ?
Only the journey's written,
not the destination.
- Convenient.
- How else do you explain
Evy's visions ?
That it is your son
who wears the bracelet ?
- How do you explain your mark ?
- Coincidence.
My friend,
there is a fine line
between coincidence and fate.
Don't even think about it!
Hold on there, partner.
When the time comes,
I shall truly enjoy
killing you.
But until that time,
you better be
a little nicer to me.
Now, where's my water ?
No ice ?
Make sure
he doesn't move !
They've gone.
We've lost them.
Rick !
Alex left us his tie,
and he made us
a little sand castle.
It's the Temple Island
of Philae.
They've gone to Philae.
That-a-boy, Alex.
Come on !
The great temple
of Abu Simbel.
That's the Blue Nile
down there.
We must be
out of Egypt by now.
In ancient times,
all this still belonged
to the upper kingdom.
The oasis must be
around here somewhere.
Don't worry, Evy,
we'll find him.
He's a smart kid.
He'll leave us a sign.
Surprised to see me ?
Aah !
Leaving bread crumbs, huh ?
Huh ?
We're in trouble !
Whoa !
Horus, fly !
Izzy, come hard right !
Starboard ! Starboard !
Was there a little something
you forgot to mention ? Hmm ?
Uh, people ?
Ahm Shere.
- Right.
-
- He's back !
-
Hang on !
Well, that's not good.
Hang on !
Mom ?
Dad ?
We're gonna go get my son.
Then we're gonna wanna
get out of here fast,
so make this work, lzzy.
No, no, you don't understand,
goddamn it.
This thing was filled with gas.
Not hot air-- gas.
I need gas to get
this thing off the ground.
Where am I gonna get gas
from around here ? Huh ?
Bananas ? Mangos ?
Tarzan's ass ?
Well, maybe I could finagle it
to take hot air.
But do you know how many
cubic meters I'd need ?
It's too big !
If anybody can fill
this thing up with hot air,
lzzy, it's you.
Come to Daddy.
Horus !
So, Rick,
what's the plan ?
Let's find some higher ground.
Horus !
I must go.
Where ?
I must let the commanders know
where we are.
You can't go.
If the Army of Anubis arises--
I need you to help me
find my son.
Then first,
I shall help you.
Thank you.
Look.
Roman legionnaires.
And here.
Turn-of-the-century French.
Napoleon's troops.
What in the name
of Anubis did this ?
You hear that ?
What ?
Nothing.
Absolutely nothing.
My word !
I say, chaps, look at this.
Shrunken heads.
I'd love to know
how they do that.
Just curious.
You any good
with that ?
Three times Fox and Hound's
grand champion,
I'll have you know.
You any good with that ?
You'll know soon enough.
Because the only way
to kill an Anubis warrior
is by taking off its head.
I'll remember that.
Evy, try to remember to, uh--
Just keep it tight
in the shoulder and, uh,
Lead the target a little bit,
and then, uh--
And squeeze the trigger.
Don't pull it.
I won't miss.
-
Pyramid.
- The pyramid.
Cripes, I'm in trouble now.
Now may I kill him ?
Retrieve that bracelet.
With pleasure.
Something is coming.
Jonathan ?
Yes ?
That's my husband
and my son down there.
Make me proud.
Today's that day, Evy.
Where's the boy ?
-
-
The Black Book !
Let's go !
There you are !
The time has come,
my little friend.
Let go !
- Dad !
- Alex !
Alex--
Dad !
Time to remove that
bracelet, my good son.
- Dad !
-
- Dad, behind you !
- Whoa !
Let's go.
Thank God for that.
The two of you must
sacrifice yourselves for me.
You shall be rewarded
in heaven !
Mom !
Alex !
Hey, nice shootin', Tex.
What were those creepy
little pygmy things ?
Just the local natives.
Are you sure ?
I'm sure.
It was nothin'.
Come on, Mom !
Come on ! Come on, Dad !
We have to get to the pyramid.
I have to get
the bracelet off now !
Oh, leave it on, Alex.
Looks good on you.
No, you guys !
You don't understand !
He told me...
the bracelet will kill me if
I don't get inside the pyramid
before the sun hits it !
- Today !
- Oh, my God.
Time to go !
I thought you said
it was nothing !
Where's Jonathan ?
Look !
There's a burial ground !
We're safe ! We're safe !
See those sacred stones ?
They'll never cross those.
You are sure ?
Yes, of course I'm sure !
Sorry.
My mistake.
Wait for me!
Hurry up, Jonathan!
Wait for me !
What's that for ?
Ah, nothin'.
Just a little something
in case of an emergency.
Rick.
Let's go, Alex !
Run !
Come on, Alex, faster !
Come on !
Come on !
Dad ! The bracelet !
Run ! Come on !
You know, it's not...
easy being a... dad.
Yeah, but you do it
really good.
Thanks.
They made it.
Thank God.
Oh, yes.
Great.
Fabulous.
No !
Evy !
Evy !
Jonathan !
Jonathan !
Mom !
- You're going to be all right.
Isn't she, Dad ?
- She'll be fine.
She's going to be all right.
Just get him--
Take him. Take--
Mommy's fine.
It's okay.
Where-- Evy--
Your mother's
gonna be fine, okay ?
Oh, my God !
You're real strong.
You're gonna make it.
You're gonna make it.
You're fine.
What do I do ?
What do I do, Evy ?
What do I do ?
Take care of Alex.
No.
Sweetheart, no.
I love you.
No, don't-- No.
No !
Evy ? Evy ?
No. No.
Evy!
Come back, Evy.
Evy, come back.
Come back.
Stay here.
Whoa !
Try to think of it
like this, Alex.
She's gone to a better place.
You know, like it says
in the good book.
The book.
That's it.
What ?
That's it.
Come on, Uncle Jon !
That's what ?
Come on ! Come on !
That's it ! The book !
What ?
You're too late, O'Connell.
I have released
the Army of Anubis.
Lord Imhotep shall soon
kill the Scorpion King
and take command.
Not after
I get through with him.
Aah !
Niy!
Niy!
Niy!
You realize, of course,
that this can only be done
by someone who can actually
read ancient Egyptian.
I don't know about you,
but I'm a tad rusty.
Now where ?
We go right.
How do you know ?
"Kasheesh Osirian Nye. "
Basically,
"This way to the Scorpion King."
Mum taught me.
This just might work.
It's time someone taught you
a lesson, wench.
Come on.
This is for my sister.
-
-
Is that all you've got ?
Hurry up, Alex !
"Hootashnaraba
oos Veesloo.
Ahm kum Ra.
Ahm kum Dei. "
"EfdayShokran--
EfdayShokran--"
Uncle Jon, I don't know
what this last symbol is !
- What's it look like ?
- It's a bird ! A stork !
I know that one !
I know that one !
- Then what is it ?
-
Ahmenophus !
That's it !
"EfdayShokranAhmenophus!"
Why don't you pick on
somebody your own size ?
- Oh, my God. Evy !
- Take Alex.
Go and help Rick.
No "buts," Alex.
But Mom--
- Come on, Alex.
-  But-But--
I'll be just fine.
We did it, Uncle Jon !
We did it !
Right, partner.
Now, let's go help your dad.
Nefertiri.
Anck-su-namun.
That's a little something new !
My lord !
Save me !
Save me !
Okay, now I'm a believer.
Rick !
-Jonathan !
It's a spear !
- Dad !
The gold stick thing--
It's a-- It's a spear !
Really ?
Doesn't look like a spear !
No ! That's because
it opens up into one !
Yes ? And ?
Jonathan!
It opens up into spear!
- Rick !
- Evy ?
Twist it ! Pull !
I tried it !
Push !
Jonathan, quick !
Jonathan, throw it !
Kill the Scorpion King !
Send his army
back to the Underworld !
Step aside, Alex.
I'm a professional.
Rick !
- No !
-
No !
Niy!
Go to hell,
and take your friends with you !
Dad !
Evy, no !
Get out of here !
Just get out of here !
No !
Mom !
Hang on, Rick !
Anck-su-namun !
- No !
- Anck-su-namun !
Anck-su-namun.
Whoa !
Let's go up !
This whole damn place
is gonna get sucked up !
Let's move up ! Go !
Go, Alex !
Come on ! Come on !
Rick, we're trapped !
Hey!
- Izzy !
- Come on !
Get your butts moving !
Hurry up ! Hurry up !
I haven't got all day !
Go ! You're next !
-
-Jonathan ! Hold on !
- Pull him up ! Pull him up !
- Pull up ! Pull me up !
Wait ! Wait !
Let me down ! Let me down !
- It's not worth your life,
you idiot !
- Yes, it is ! Yes, it is !
Right.
Pull me up !
Pull me up !
- Whoo ! Whoo !
- Okay.
Yeah !
O'Connell.
You almost got me killed!
At least
you didn't get shot.
Izzy !
Thank you !
Thank you !
Mmm ! Mmm !
Yes !
O'Connell,
who the hell you been
messin' with this time ?
Huh ?
Oh, you know, the usual.
Mummies, pygmies,
big bugs.
I thought I almost
lost you there.
For a moment there,
you did.
Would you like to know
what heaven looks like ?
Later.
Oh, please !
That's half mine,
you know.
What ?
That's half mine.
I have no idea
what you're talking about.
What ?
You took my gold stick !
I know you took my gold stick !
I swear on the head
of my wife, I have no idea
what you're talking about.
You haven't--
You ain't got a wife !
I don't have
your gold stick either !
Forever.
Forever may not
belong enough
For my love
I have a will
but I'm lost inside
Your time
If you could
would you come with me
To the other side
Forever may not
belong enough
Forever may not
belong enough
Forever may not
belong enough
For this life
Forever
Forever
Forever
Forever
Forever
Forever
Forever may not
belong enough
For you to know
Just how far I traveled
Just how far
I will go
Open your heart
and everything
Will be allright
Open your heart, baby
Leave with me
Don't be afraid
Forever
Forever
Forever
Forever
Forever may not
belong enough
For our love
Forever
Forever
Forever
Forever
Forever may not
belong enough
Forever may not
belong enough
Forever may not
belong enough
It might belong enough
