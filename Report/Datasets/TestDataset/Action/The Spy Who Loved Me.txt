Captain wants you
to keep 500 feet.
Maneuvering, Control.
Come in shallow to 500 feet.
- Keep 500 feet.
- Keep 500 feet, sir.
What the hell's going on, Eddie?
Emergency stations.
Captain to the control room.
- What's going on?
- Number five bulkhead shut down.
- Control, Maneuvering.
- Control, Captain.
I'm losing electrical frequency.
I'll have to break down the system.
Control, Sound Room.
Total loss of power
on all sonar sets.
Surface.
Blow forward, blow aft, full ahead.
Full rise on both planes.
Raise the search periscope.
Oh, my God.
Yeah, put him through.
Good morning, sir.
No, First Sea Lord.
There's been no contact
with Ranger yet, sir.
No sightings,
no distress signals, sir.
It looks very much like it.
Yes, of course I will, sir.
We've lost one
of our nuclear submarines.
What?
The submarine Potempkin
disappeared without trace?
What a catastrophe, Comrade Chairman.
Yes, of course.
I'll assign our best agent immediately.
- Rubelvitch, where is Agent XXX?
- On leave, General.
At a people's rest
and recuperation center.
It's been a wonderful weekend.
- I shall never forget it.
- Nor will I.
When can we meet again?
As soon as my mission
is accomplished.
I must go.
I have to be in Austria tonight.
Five more minutes.
Agent XXX.
Calling Agent XXX.
You will report to headquarters
immediately.
Agent XXX,
acknowledge and verify.
This is XXX.
Message received and understood.
Yes, Mr. Prime Minister. I understand
the gravity of the situation.
Yes, I'll put our best man on it
at once.
Good-bye.
Moneypenny, where is 007?
He's on a mission, sir,
in Austria.
Tell him to pull out,
immediately.
Oh, James,
I cannot find the words.
Let me try
and enlarge your vocabulary.
What's happened?
- Where are you going?
- Sorry, darling. Something came up.
But, James, I need you.
So does England.
He has just left.
Over and out.
Message received. We are waiting.
Over and out.
Now.
Nobody does it better
Makes me feel sad for the rest
Nobody does it
Half as good as you
Baby, you're the best
I wasn't looking
But somehow you found me
I tried to hide from
Your love light
But like heaven above me
The spy who loved me
Is keeping all my secrets safe tonight
And nobody does it better
Though sometimes I wish
Someone could
Nobody does it
Quite the way you do
Why do you have to be so good
The way that you hold me
Whenever you hold me
There's some kind of magic
Inside you
That keeps me from running
But just keep it coming
How'd you learn
to do the things you do
Baby, baby
Baby, you're the best
Send in Agent XXX.
You sent for me, Comrade General.
Good morning. Major Amasova,
we are facing a most delicate situation.
Our nuclear submarine Potempkin
has disappeared.
Sabotage?
That is for you to find out.
We have one lead:
a connection in Cairo.
You leave tonight.
Will that be all?
There is one more thing.
I regret to inform you, Major, that
Agent Sergei Borzov has been killed.
On a mission at Berngarten
in the Austrian Alps.
A tragic occurrence,
Comrade General.
It had not escaped our notice
that you and Agent Borzov...
had been more than friends
for some time.
I'm very sorry.
How did he die?
We haven't all the details yet.
It appears he'd become involved
in a British Secret Service operation.
Please keep me informed,
Comrade General.
I should very much like to meet...
whoever was responsible
for his death.
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.
- Good morning, 007.
- Hello, Q.
- Mission successful?
- On and off.
- Good morning, Commander.
- Good morning, sir.
- Captain Forsyth.
- Sir.
Commander Bond, sir.
- Mr. Fredrick Gray, Minister of Defense.
- Good morning, Commander.
Admiral Hargreaves,
Flag Officer, Submarines.
- Ark Royal, wasn't it?
- Yes, sir.
- I believe M told you about this.
- Yes, Minister.
Over here, please, gentlemen.
This, I take it, is Ranger's
prearranged coastal patrol area.
- That's right.
- How many people knew this course?
Admiral Hargreaves, myself...
and Talbot, the submarine captain.
Good God.
Where did this come from?
I'm sorry, Benson.
For the moment, that's top secret.
I see, sir.
Commander, this tracing means...
that the Russians can track our nuclear
submarines underwater and sink them.
- I believe it does.
- How could they? It's impossible.
It's quite simple.
Heat signature recognition,
most likely.
- With your permission, Minister?
- Yes, of course.
Thank you.
We already know that satellites
with infrared heat sensors...
can detect a nuclear missile
in flight by its tail fire.
Well?
Someone can now locate
a submerged nuclear submarine...
in exactly the same way,
by its wake.
That means they can totally undermine
our Western defense strategy.
Yes, it looks like it.
Where did we get that tracing, Freddie?
Cairo, diplomatic bag.
Somebody got the plans of that tracking
system and is trying to sell them.
They sent us that tracing as proof
that it's genuine.
Then, if there is a deal to be made,
the price will be high.
"High"? Astronomical.
That missing submarine
had 16 Polaris missiles aboard.
We have a contact in Egypt?
M will give you the details.
You leave tonight.
Dr. Bechmann
and Professor Markovitz.
Thank you.
Gentlemen, now that the moment
has come to bid you farewell...
I congratulate both you, Doctor,
and you, Professor...
on your brilliant work
in the development...
of the submarine tracking system.
Thanks primarily to you,
I'm happy to say...
that the first phase
of our operation...
has met with considerable success.
I have instructed my assistant...
to have paid into your...
Swiss bank account...
the sum of $10 million each.
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you, indeed.
And that, I think,
concludes our business.
Before you go, however...
I very much regret to inform you...
that a dangerous development...
has recently been brought
to my notice.
Someone has been attempting
to sell the plans...
of our tracking project...
to competing world powers.
Someone intimately associated
with the project.
My dear, it would be more seemly
if you left us.
Thank you.
It was you
who betrayed me.
You had access
to all the information.
Now you will pay the penalty.
Once again, gentlemen,
my most profound thanks.
- Sandor.
- Yes, sir.
Jaws.
I'm assigning you the task...
of recovering the microfilm copy...
of the tracking system.
Sandor, you will go with him.
Obey him.
Every person who even comes into contact
with that microfilm...
is to be eliminated.
Stand by for helicopter takeoff.
All personnel,
clear the flight deck platform.
Cancel transfer of $20 million.
Inform next of kin
that a tragic accident...
has resulted in the death
of Professor Markovitz...
and Dr. Bechmann.
The funeral was at sea.
May the peace of Allah
descend upon this magnificent abode...
and allow a poor traveler
to enter.
May the hospitality
of these miserable quarters...
be sufficient
to your honored needs.
James Bond, what a delightful surprise
after all these years.
- Sit down.
- Thank you.
I always wondered what you were gonna do
when you went down from Cambridge.
I never had any problems knowing
what you were going to do, Hosein.
We don't only have oil, you know.
What can I offer you?
Sheep's eyes? Dates?
- Vodka martini?
- Information.
Who is putting the submarine
tracking system on the market?
What a pity it is you insist
on being so businesslike.
The gentleman you will
eventually be dealing with...
is a certain Max Kalba.
- "Eventually"?
- To reach Kalba...
you must first make contact
with a man called Fekkesh.
Aziz Fekkesh. I'll give you
his apartment address in Cairo.
It's too late to meet him today.
Can I persuade you to accept a bed
for the night?
That's kind of you, Hosein,
but I really feel I--
Are you quite sure I can't persuade you
to stay the night?
When one is in Egypt...
one should delve deeply
into its treasures.
Yes. Oh, I'm sorry.
The door was open.
Mr. Fekkesh is expecting me.
I phoned him.
He asked me
to give you a message.
He will be late.
May I ask where he is?
Mr. Fekkesh asked me to entertain you
while you are waiting.
Really?
Where is Fekkesh?
You are very suspicious.
I find I live much longer that way.
Now where is he?
If there's anything at all
you would like--
I had lunch,
but I seem to have missed dessert.
As urgent as my appointment is,
I'd hate him to walk in and surprise us.
There is no danger of that.
He'll be some time then?
Is he meeting someone?
I'm sorry,
I cannot answer that question.
Oh, I think you can.
Where's Fekkesh?
Pyramids.
What a helpful chap.
You have come tonight
to the most fabulous...
and celebrated place
in the world.
Here on the Plateau of Giza
stands forever...
the mightiest of human achievements.
No traveler, emperor,
merchant or poet...
has trodden on these sands...
and not gasped in awe.
The curtain of night
is about to rise...
and disclose the stage on which...
the drama of a civilization
took place.
Those involved have been present
since the dawn of history...
pitched stubbornly
against sand and wind.
And the voice of the desert...
has crossed the centuries.
Excuse me, Major.
I'll be back in a moment.
With each new dawn,
I see the sun god rise...
on the far bank of the Nile.
I am the faithful warden
at the foot of his lord.
So faithful, so vigilant...
so near him...
that he gave me his face
for my own.
I am a pharaoh's companion...
and I am he, the pharaoh.
This is the tomb of Cheops...
Pharaoh of the Fourth Dynasty
Here is the Great Pyramid
which he built...
to defend himself against death.
Here in the depths of his tomb...
a servant of the king
awaits the call...
to set out upon his journey
into eternity.
Death lies waiting.
Where is Fekkesh?
With the pharaohs.
- You killed him.
- No, he was dead when I found him.
Hope you enjoyed the show.
Good night.
What an unexpected pleasure.
Welcome to the Mujaba Club.
Buy you a drink,
Major Amasova?
Or may I call you XXX?
You know who I am.
You made quite an impression.
I'm sorry about Ivan and Boris.
They exceeded their orders.
Good staff is hard to find these days.
Yes, sir?
The lady will have a Bacardi
on the rocks.
For the gentleman,
vodka martini, shaken not stirred.
Touché.
Touché.
Commander James Bond.
Recruited to the British Secret Service
from the Royal Navy.
Licensed to kill, and has done so
on numerous occasions.
Many lady friends,
but married only once.
- Wife killed--
- All right, you've made your point.
You're sensitive.
About certain things, yes.
Now, if you'll excuse me.
Tragically,
I have a previous engagement.
Happily enough, so do I.
- Good-bye, Mr. Bond.
- Let's say au revoir.
I have the oddest feeling
we'll be meeting again sometime.
I'm looking for Mr. Kalba.
Mr. Max Kalba is the owner
of the club, sir.
Over there.
Mr. Kalba,
my name is James Bond.
What of it?
You had an appointment
with Mr. Fekkesh.
- Well?
- He won't be joining you.
You have something
I'm interested in buying.
Just a moment.
I would like to bid for it too.
You forgot your drink.
Thank you.
It seems you have competition,
Mr. Bond.
From where I sit...
I fancy you will find the lady's figure
hard to match.
Might the contestants be permitted
to view the article for sale?
Well, now,
who will start the bidding?
Mr. Kalba, sir, the telephone.
An urgent call.
Excuse me.
Pardon me.
This is Kalba. Hello?
Another?
We've really got to stop
meeting like this.
Kalba was called to the phone.
What happened?
He was cut off, permanently.
Where is the microfilm?
Search me.
He must have it,
or you wouldn't be here.
You don't know who he is.
- He's a professional killer.
- Called Jaws?
Make no mistake, Mr. Bond...
I want that microfilm...
and I'm going to get it.
Unless I get it first.
Watch out!
Don't move.
Give me the microfilm.
Egyptian builders.
Sorry.
You're just too late.
Give me the key!
The key!
Try the big one.
Can you play any other tune?
Let's try reverse.
That's backwards.
Would you like me to drive?
Women drivers.
Quiet. Watch this.
Shaken, but not stirred.
That gorilla must have his teeth
fixed by a riveter.
By the way,
thanks for deserting me back there.
Every woman for herself.
Remember?
Still, you did save my life.
We all make mistakes, Mr. Bond.
The cylinder head gasket.
What did he say?
He thinks we're overdressed,
but he'll take us to Cairo.
Good.
It's getting cold.
Is there anything I can do
to warm you up?
You don't have to worry about me.
I went on a survival course
in Siberia.
Yes, I believe a great number
of your countrymen do.
What did they teach you?
That it's very important
to have a positive mental attitude.
Nothing more practical than that?
Food is also very important.
What else?
When necessary,
shared bodily warmth.
That's the part I like.
Is this really what they do
in Siberia?
Yes, but not how they do it.
You're not trying to take advantage
of me, are you?
The thought never crossed my mind.
Just when it was getting interesting.
Where's the girl?
- Morning, Moneypenny.
- Good morning, James.
Is he in?
It must have been quite a party.
Boring.
I dropped off.
Hello, James.
We've been expecting you.
Good morning, sir.
There's been a change in plan.
You probably recognize my opposite
number in the KGB, General Gogol.
I believe you're familiar
with Major Amasova.
Enough to know which brand
of cigarette she smokes.
Our respective governments...
agreed to pool their resources to find
out what happened to our submarines.
We have entered a new era...
of Anglo-Soviet cooperation.
As a sign of Russian good faith...
I'm prepared to make available to you
the microfilm...
recovered by Agent XXX.
With considerable ease,
I might add.
Don't bother. It's useless.
I examined it on the boat.
I assure you it is quite genuine.
Except that the vital technical
information has been taken out.
This was only intended
to whet our appetites.
Maybe Q can make something
out of it.
I want that ready
for Akmid's tea party.
After you, Alexis.
- After you, Miles.
- Thank you.
That could bring tears
to your eyes.
Everybody ready? Right.
We're pretty certain that this drawing
was drafted in Italy.
The size corresponds
with a Venetian octavo...
and the typeface
is an Italian one.
Now, note the slight upward stress
on the transversals.
What's that mark there?
Probably a show-through
of something...
the drawing was resting on
when it was photographed.
Must have been done in a hurry.
- Can you enlarge it?
- Wait a minute.
- "Oratory"? What is that?
- It's another word for chapel.
Looks a bit like a bishop's miter.
It is a fish.
That is the symbol
of the Stromberg Shipping Line.
Karl Stromberg? He's one
of the richest men in the world.
One of the principle capitalist
exploiters of the West, sir.
So it's not "oratory,"
it's laboratory.
Stromberg has a marine
research laboratory.
On Corsica, I believe.
Well done.
Actually, it is in Sardinia.
That's brilliant.
I'm certain that two such
perceptive talents...
will enjoy working together
in Sardinia...
and that it will help to make
Anglo-Soviet cooperation a reality.
Here we are.
That was a delicious meal.
Thank you.
I didn't realize you had
such a healthy appetite.
Neither did I.
It must be traveling by train.
I always enjoy it.
I remember when--
What do you remember?
I was going to talk about a mission.
Silly, isn't it?
We can't talk,
and yet we're in the same business.
- But with rival companies.
- We're not rivals at the moment.
Then how about a nightcap,
on the company?
My company.
I'm very sorry. I have an idea
tomorrow is going to be a busy day.
- I must sleep.
- Yes.
- Well, then, sleep well.
- And you.
Good night.
What happened?
He just dropped in
for a quick bite.
You're hurt.
Later.
Let's worry about you.
What was it they taught you
on that survival course?
A positive mental attitude.
And shared bodily warmth.
Nothing about keeping out of drafts?
Still enjoy traveling by train?
You saved my life.
Thank you, James.
I'm sorry.
Why don't you lie down
and let me look at it?
What can we use for a bandage?
How about this?
Wait a moment.
- Good morning, Major Boothroyd.
- Good morning, Major.
Look what Q has brought for us.
Isn't it nice?
Right.
Now pay attention, 007.
Take great care of this equipment.
There are some special accessories--
- Have I ever let you down?
- Frequently.
You have a reservation for me.
The name is Sterling.
Yes. Mr. and Mrs. Sterling.
Booked from Cairo.
That's right.
We have Suite A-5 for you;
a sitting room and two bedrooms.
Moneypenny being over-efficient.
Do you have any messages for me?
