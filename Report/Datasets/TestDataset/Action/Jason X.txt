Why don't you stare at this for a
little while, you ugly bastard?
- What are you doing here?
- I'm taking the specimen.
You can't. I haven't prepped
the cryostasis chamber.
I don't want him frozen,
rowan.
- I want him soft.
- We've already discussed this.
Yeah, well, I had to go
over your head.
I'm moving him
to our Scranton facility.
You can't risk transporting
him through open country.
This isn't open
for discussion.
His unique ability
to regenerate
lost and damaged tissue,
it's just--
it cries out
for more research.
And you're willing to risk the
deaths of civilians if he escapes?
Yes.
But I'm sure sergeant
Marcus and his men
can handle the transfer
just fine.
- Sergeant?
- Everything's under control, ma'am.
- Dr. Wimmer, please.
- Rowan...
He's no longer
your problem.
Can we get
that rag off him?
What the hell?!
Rowan:
Oh my God!
- Get out of here.
- What happened?
I'm sorry.
Automated voice:
Cryogenic breach.
Oh, God. No!
No! No!
- Man: Kay-Em?
- Kay-Em: No viruses, no bacteria.
No toxins.
It's clean.
- It's so cold.
- Wow.
Someone want to tell me
what that is?
It's like a big kind
of frozen storage thing.
Probably
a cryostasis unit.
I'd guess early port series. Kay-Em?
Quadra-port 11.
Manufactured in 2010.
Precise historic records
are inconsistent.
- Anyone thinking what I'm thinking?
- Open it up.
- What the hell is that?
- Humanoid.
Organic composition
is unclear.
- Can someone tell me what's on his face?
- Ahh...
Some kind of 20th century
carbon filtration unit?
- It's a hockey mask.
- Very good, tsunaron.
- What's a hockey mask?
- Facial armor.
Used in a sport
outlawed in 2024.
Amazing.
Absolute museum quality.
Are you paying attention,
Azrael?
Yeah.
Well, don't touch anything.
Guys, we've got
another body here.
- Kay-Em? - She's perfectly preserved.
- Self-crystallization
is at 25%. - 25%?
Suggest extensive nanotech and
phase one cell reconstruction.
Wait, wait a minute.
Are you--
are you saying that--
that we can bring her
back to life?
Yes, but she
is deteriorating.
Opening the door has
compromised her hibernation.
Lou, get ready
for dust-off.
- We have a priority evac.
- Copy that. Ready in five.
Not five, now.
Look out!
You'll be fine.
Fine?!
I'm missing my arm!
You're so pretty.
Kicker,
are the doors secure?
- Locked and blocked.
- Beautiful.
Lift-off in three,
two, one...
Ha, ha, ha. Yeah!
I love this part.
- What did you find?
- You won't believe it.
Get the sarge
on the horn.
Woman: You hear, division four
just entered the occupied zone?
- Casualties?
- Minimal.
I'd love to know how we
got this screwed up gig.
I didn't join the corps
to become a friggin' babysitter.
- Brodski here.
- Yeah, sarge,
- we found a viable.
- Say again?
We found two bodies
in deep cryostasis.
The cam unit thinks we can
resuscitate the female.
Female?
Yeah.
- Crutch, do you copy?
-
Wake the hell up!
- Yeah, what do you want?
- They're on their way back.
- Prepare for docking and power up the lab.
- Yeah, yeah, whatever.
- What does she look like?
- She's cute.
- Yeah. And single.
- Mm-hmm.
I'm so lonely.
We need to get her
to the lab.
- You think you can bring her back?
- We'll find out.
- You're not going to bring him back, are you?
- No, it's impossible.
Aw, shit.
I forgot my arm.
Yeah, here you go,
dumbass.
Hi, hand.
- Any idea how long she's been down?
- 4.55 centuries.
That's one hell
of a wake-up call.
I'm bitchy as hell
when I wake up.
Did you just wake up?
- Kinsa--
- you guys always find the cool shit.
- Where's waylander?
- He's in lab one charging the bed now.
Good. Find stoney and
adrienne and get to lab two.
Once we're in the clear, I'd
like to check your circuits.
Oh, I'll bet you would.
It isn't like that.
Adrienne, I need you
in lab two.
- You found something?
- Two viables.
- In what condition?
- Perfect. We're attempting reanimation with one.
- What can I do?
- Use stoney and kinsa--
- they're second year, they're gonna slow me down.
- Walk them through it.
Run a complete structural
scan, log them properly,
and put them in stasis.
I'll check back later.
- Okay, where are we?
- The board's all green, teach.
- The n2's warm and ready.
- Good.
- Kay-Em, begin stabilizing any cellular fractures.
- Yes, Professor.
Janessa, I need a full scan.
Glycerol levels,
- cerebral profusion, the whole works.
- I live to serve.
Let's see what
we're dealing with.
Decrystallization
of the membranes is now at 32%.
- Somebody get those clothes off her.
- Oh, I got it!
I got it. Honestly.
Waylander, where's
her diffusion barriers?
Here we go.
Whoo.
Stay still,
or you'll end up getting an elbow
where your wrist should be.
Specimen 4420 found
in sector 3930l
on earth prime.
Subject discovered
in complete cryosuspension.
- How's it going?
- Hey man, what's up?
- Where do you want this?
- On the specimen table.
- Hi, baby.
- Hey, gorgeous.
Initiating scan.
Mmm, smart and sexy.
Professor, take a look
at this guy's scan.
Amazing.
How does he function
with a brain that small?
- Way manages.
- That's very funny.
- He's a big boy.
- I bet he's hung like a mammoth.
Okay, you guys. Just get
the hell out of here.
- Come back when you're more focused.
- You serious?
- Yes, just go.
- Thanks, adrienne.
- Come.
- Thanks.
Don't mention it.
See what you can salvage
from the optic cortex,
- then move on.
- My pleasure, Professor.
Ready phase two.
Bring on the ants.
That's it.
Come to mama.
Temperature 96.2. 97.
- Cool. It's working.
- 98.6 and holding.
Cell reconstruction
is complete.
Internal defib
in three...
Two, one.
Easy, easy.
Vital signs are normal
and strong.
No shit.
Easy, easy.
Did you get him?
Where is he?
- Tell me you got him.
- Got who?
No one's here.
You're safe with us.
There was a leak
in the cryo unit and...
- Was he contained?
- Was contained.
But when the cryo unit ruptured,
you didn't escape it.
For how long?
The year is 2455.
Now, I know this is
a huge shock,
but you're going
to be safe here.
You're aboard grendel. A class
four catamaran transport ship.
We're on our way
back home
and you're gonna be
just fine.
That's over 400 years.
Secure line.
Perez, dieter.
Solaris research
station. Connect.
- Lowe, you bastard.
- We've hit the motherlode.
- Do you know what time it is?
- I don't care.
- We've got a gold mine.
- A box of DVDs is not a gold mine.
I've told you
I can't move them.
Just look at the file.
Two 400-year-old specimens.
One well-preserved,
the other one--
are you ready for this?
Up and walking around.
and walking around.
Yeah. 455 years,
to be exact.
Who cares?
Who gives a shit?
People. People will pay
huge money to see her.
Let me ask
you a question--
is this the first person
you've reanimated?
- Of course not.
- How many people are out there today
walking around,
thawed out and looking good?
- Hundreds.
- Thousands.
Maybe.
But not 450 years old.
- She's twice as old as anyone on the planet.
- 250, 450.
What's the difference?
Doctor, 100 years ago when re-animation
was more unpredictable,
sure, maybe.
- But now it's old news.
- Damn it. I need money.
I know, I know.
The other viable
is marked Voorhees.
That's not
Jason Voorhees, is it?
What do you know about him?
Jason Voorhees.
He killed nearly
and simply disappeared
without a trace.
Under the right buyer,
he could be worth a fortune.
I've got him frozen
right here on the ship.
- You work out a list of ownership?
- No list.
He's my find.
He's mine.
- What about your students?
- They're students.
The educational experience
will be enough.
Doctor, doctor,
you are one son of a bitch.
Soon to be one rich
son of a bitch.
Lowe out.
Professor,
I think that...
We need to talk
about my midterm.
Oh, poor baby.
No wonder you wore this thing.
Harder.
Harder.
Who's been a naughty
little boy?
I have.
- Harder. - You want it a little harder?
- Yeah.
- How's that?
- Oh, God. That's it.
- That's it right there?!
- Oh, yeah.
- Daddy likes it hard?
- Yeah!
- Daddy wants it hard?!
- Oh, yeah. That's it.
- Right there?!
You like it right there?
- A little harder for daddy?! - Yeah!
- Come on, come on!
- You pass!
- What do you think?
- Hmm?
- Do you like them?
- They're fine.
Look, Kay-Em, I don't think
this is going to work.
Why do you want
those things, anyways?
- Janessa has them.
- Well, janessa's...
- Real?
- Yes.
Let's not complicate
things, all right?
I like you just
the way you are.
I think
you're perfect.
Okay.
Help me!
Somebody help me!
No! No!
No!!
I brought you
something to eat.
Not much longer
and we'll be at earth two.
Earth two?
What happened to earth one?
It's dead.
The oceans, the soil--
neither will sustain life.
Can I do anything else
for you?
You want to tell me
what happened down there?
I take it being stabbed
and frozen
wasn't part of your plan.
I'm a...
I was a project leader
at crystal lake research.
- The subject was Jason Voorhees.
- Jason Voorhees?
Notorious murderer?
We executed him
for the first time in 2008.
- For the first time?
- Mm-hmm.
We tried everything.
Electrocution, gas,
firing squad,
we even hung him once.
Nothing worked.
Finally it was decided that
if we couldn't terminate him,
we could at least contain him--
cryogenic stasis.
Freeze him till we could
figure out what to do.
- Seems sensible.
- I thought so.
But unfortunately some people
who were too smart
for their own good,
felt that a creature
that couldn't be killed,
was simply too valuable
to just file away.
In the end it always
comes down to money.
How do you thank someone
who gives you back your life?
You're going to be alive
for a long time.
We'll figure out something.
Why don't you
just admit it?
You want me.
I could never be with a girl whose
balls are bigger than mine.
Guys, our star patient
is back.
Rowan, this is tsunaron
and janessa.
- Hi.
- Hi.
I see that
my clothes fit okay.
Oh, these are yours?
They're great. Thank you.
Whoa.
What are those?
These are janessa's
love children.
You see now, it is that wit of yours
that is what repels
all human females.
- And of course you've met sergeant Brodski.
- Yes. Hi again.
- Hi. - And this is the lovely Kay-Em 14,
tsunaron's little
love-bot.
Easy, janessa.
Kay-Em is a knowledge
matrix android
that I have been
programming.
Amazing.
- She looks so real.
- I am real.
- Where do you want this?
- Lab two, I think.
Whoa, whoa,
where did you get that?
From your friend, the big
guy with the hockey mask.
- You brought him on board?
- He's in the next lab. We're quite safe.
- "Safe"?
- Our scans reveal him to be very dead.
Could your scans
be wrong?
I think you should just get rid
of him, he's too dangerous.
That would be irresponsible and foolhardy.
He's a valuable scientific artifact
that must be carefully preserved.
Much like yourself.
He is an unstoppable
killing machine.
Believe me,
he's definitely dead.
Show me.
Attention, we have
a hostile on board.
- Grunt team, report to weapons.
- The chick?
Repeat, we have
a hostile on board.
Grunt team,
report to weapons.
Everyone else,
get to lab one.
- Baby, I'm not ready yet.
- Hurry up.
Grunt team's assembled.
Dallas is a no-show.
- Sergeant--
- where the hell is he?
- Don't know, sarge.
- Damn!
Look, we need to talk.
- Do you have all your kids yet? - Yes.
-
- Oh, God.
Stoney...
Stoney's dead.
- Oh, my God.
- Stoney's dead.
Kicker!
I want full armor and tac.
I want nothing left of this guy
by the time we reach solaris.
You heard him grunts,
let's get moving!
Whoa, whoa! Nothing left of him?
What have you got in mind?
Take your kids
to lab one,
and stay there
till you hear from me.
I just saved
your ass.
You know,
don't get cocky.
You must really feel
like a wuss, huh, big boy?
Check the score, kid,
it's still 9 - 3.
Yeah, but I got my groove on,
you know what I'm saying?
- So what do you say, next kill wins?
- Lock and load.
You're going down.
You are so going down.
- What the hell?
- I thought this was an alien SIM.
Yeah, it is.
Pause play.
- I said, pause play.
- He's not pausing.
Yeah, no kidding.
I think we need
to reboot.
- That does not count as a kill.
- Yes, it does.
Okay, screw this.
Game over.
What the hell?
Hey, drop the kid!
Drop the kid! Now!
Azrael, get out of here!
I got him!
I got him!
- I got no shot! Move!
- I got--
- Sergeant Brodski.
- Don't leave those kids alon.
- What's the matter with you?
- We are less than an hour from solaris.
They have seven
fully-equipped tactical units,
that are more than capable
of taking care of this.
- I say we wait and sedate him.
- I am taking this guy out.
- Sergeant, I need him alive.
- No, you want him alive.
What you need
is to get out of my way!
Look, there are other
considerations--
financial considerations.
My only consideration
is the safety
of the people
on this ship.
All right, 100,000.
- Five.
- Five?
- Dallas not here yet?
- Nope.
Find him, bring him up
to speed.
Condor, you have a bfg?
You're with me.
Sven, geko, you got
the starboard pontoon.
Sarge, what do we do
when we find this guy?
Well, I promised the doc
we'd take him alive.
So after you blow him
all to hell,
- put one in his leg so we can say we tried.
- All: Yeah!
Oh, lord.
- Sarge, I got Dallas.
- Where the hell is he?
He's dead.
Sarge, we got a body
in bay two.
- Who is it?
- It's Azrael.
What the hell's
going on here?
Sarge,
we've got a blood trail
heading toward the cargo bay.
Condor, kicker and I
will take cargo main.
The rest of you take
port side.
I hope they know
what they're doing.
These guys live
for this stuff.
-
- Sorry.
- Don't do that!
- Dude.
- What? - You scream like a girl.
- Screw you.
- You wish.
Lou, is that you?
Lou, I swear, you mess with an
engineer, you're going to wake up
in the morning with a
waste hose in your bunk.
Asshole.
What the hell?
Crutch, get down now!
- What the hell's going on?
- Crutch, out now.
Oh, you wrecked
my stuff.
We nailed him.
He's got to be here.
Condor, airborne.
Briggs.
Where the hell's sven?
Condor,
anything topside?
Negative, sarge.
There's no sign of him.
This isn't
going to work.
Keep your eyes peeled.
Everything's
under control.
Condor, report.
Sven, report.
Condor, report.
Report!
Damn.
- Sarge, we found condor.
- What's his condition?
He's screwed.
Let's smoke
this fucker.
Sarge, sven's dead.
Jesus. You have got
to get them out of there.
They know
what they're doing!
Oh, man.
Geko, geko.
I got him!
I got him!
Yes! Yes!
See, they got him!
Don't take your eyes
off him.
I'm on my way.
Take your time.
He ain't going nowhere.
Briggs...
Get out of here.
where are you, damn it?
He's all alone in there.
It's going to take more than
a poke in the ribs
to put down this old dog.
Yeah,
that oughta do it.
Such a waste.
I told him to stay calm,
to wait until
we got to solaris,
and then we could take
care of this monster.
I said, "don't go in
unprepared."
Brodski was
just too proud.
-
-
Crutch:
Who locked the damn door?
Somebody want to tell me
what the hell is going on?
The grunts are dead.
- Which ones?
- All of them.
Whoa.
Oh, man.
Lou, how long till
we reach solaris?
I'm taking us out
of hyperdrive right now.
Kids and their goddamn
field trips.
Let's bring a psycho on board.
Yeah, sure.
I just know I'm going
to get blamed for this shit.
Solaris to grendel, we have you on approach.
Stand by for docking number.
Solaris, we need military
and medical at the gate.
We've got a big problem here.
A real go-fuck.
Solaris:
Grendel, what's your problem?
Look, we're going
to be all right.
He's trapped
in the cargo bay.
- We're locked up in here.
- Can the solaris grunts kill him?
Absolutely.
I've been in constant contact
with solaris.
They have 60 highly-trained
professionals standing by
to get us off this ship.
Solaris to grendel:
Pull up.
Abort docking.
You're coming in too fast.
- What now?
- Computer: Warning.
- Oh, shit! Hang on!
- Prepare for impact.
Oh, what's going on?!
What the hell
is going on?!
- Everyone okay?
- What just happened?
Waylander.
It's all right.
We just overshot it.
We'll turn around
and go back.
Hang on.
Oh my God.
Solaris is gone.
Gone?
It can't be gone.
Look for yourself.
It's gone.
What are we
going to do?
Lou, what sort of damage
we looking at?
I'm sending out
a distress beacon.
- Lou?
- We've lost our entire port pontoon.
The internal pressure
is stable.
Our main thrusters
are off-line.
- Life support?
- We should be okay for awhile.
- But he's out there.
- We're going to be fine.
We're in a high volume
traffic Lane,
another ship's gonna come by.
I'm sure of it!
- We're going to be safe here.
-
Shut up!
- What are you doing?
- Shh.
- Maybe he gave up.
- You really think so?
Shh, shh, shh.
I don't think
he's out there.
Why don't you just stick your
head out and have a peek?
Oh my God! Go!
Waylander:
Go, come on, go!
Move it, move it!
Come on!
Let's go!
Where's Professor Lowe?
Hi.
Look, have you considered
how valuable you are?
With my help
you could have it all.
I know people.
I have connections.
Together we could
make a fortune.
Oh, shit.
Oh, you want
your machete back?
Shit, it's yours!
Take it!
Just remember
who saved it for you.
Guys, it's okay.
He just wanted his
machete back!
Whew.
I'm gonna go back
to my room.
'Cause stoney's
going to meet me there.
All right, look.
How do we get off this ship?
- I don't know.
- Could you beam us off or something?
"Beam us off"?
The shuttle.
Hell yeah.
The shuttle.
- What about it, crutch?
- Yeah.
I can do pre-launch
from the bridge.
Good, good. The rest of us
will head to the shuttle.
- We'll start the launch list.
- I'm with you, crutch.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You know how to use that?
Yep. It's just like
riding a bike.
- Once you learn, you never forget how.
- Good.
Kay-Em and I will go
to the supply hold.
- We'll meet you at the shuttle bay.
- See you there.
What's a bike?
There's enough fire power here
to level a moon.
I say we pack this stuff up
and head for the shuttle.
What do you think?
Are we going to make it?
The statistical probability
of survival is 12%.
- Nope.
- Bullshit, Kay-Em! That's bullshit!
Preparation for launch may be
a relatively simple procedure,
but getting there alive...
It is a problem.
Are you telling me
there's absolutely
no chance for us
to better our odds?!
Statistical probability
of survival
just went up to 53%.
You want to go for 100?
He's here.
Quiet.
But if he's in here,
he's going to kill us.
Be quiet.
One more sound and I'll
snap your neck myself.
- Got it?
- She's good with people.
- Did you see that?
- What?
I think there's someone
still alive over there.
We don't have time
for this.
Which way
is the shuttle bay?
Straight through.
Go. I'll meet you there.
Just don't wreck
my pants.
Come on, girl.
We're going home.
Crutch:
Oh, Lou.
Waylander:
Jesus, that's twisted.
Of course,
I've seen worse.
Okay, let's get
to work.
Brodski?
Okay.
We're going to get you
out of here.
- No.
- Oh, God.
I'm going to go get help
and I'll be back.
Give me your vest.
Oh, bastard.
Hey... be lucky
you weren't alive
during the Microsoft
conflict.
We were beating each other
with our own severed limbs.
That's nice.
Okay.
Let's get us home.
- Kinsa, are you there?
- Yes, ma'am.
- Crutch? - Prepare for fuel transfer.
- Cell six and seven bypass.
- Hydraulic lifters.
Pressurized and damped.
- It's Brodski. He's alive. - No shit?
Yeah. I can't move him.
Are way and crutch back?
- No, they're still on the bridge.
- I need help.
Hey, guys,
Brodski's still alive.
But rowan can't move him
by herself.
Go, go, go. I can handle it from here.
Tell them I'm on my way.
Watch your back.
Crutch, how we doing
for time?
With a giant shitload
of good luck,
we might be ready to go.
Good.
Rowan. Hey.
Where's Brodski?
I-- he was here.
I don't get it.
And I am going home.
Lowe!
Oh, shit!
I got company here, people!
Let's go.
Kinsa, open the door.
Open the damn door!
- Why aren't you on board?
- Kinsa won't open the door.
I think that she's
finally lost it
and this is a really
bad time for this!
Janessa,
give me the comm.
Kinsa, kinsa honey,
it's rowan.
I need you to open
the door.
No.
Kinsa, sweetheart,
it's all over.
We can go home. All you need
to do is open the door for us.
No.
-
- Come on, guys!
Jesus Christ, kinsa,
open the goddamn door!
Oh no, kinsa, the fuel
lines are still attached!
Kinsa!
Now what?
Now basically we die.
Bullshit!
Okay, new plan.
You hold him
and I'll run.
Hey, slappy.
I got a little
something for you.
- Oh, wow.
- I gave her an upload.
I'm afraid I'm going
to have to hurt you now.
Kay-Em!
That-- that didn't
go so well.
Gotcha!
Hey.
Giddy-up.
I had it under control,
but thanks.
My pleasure.
Yeah.
- You did it.
- Kay-Em!
Who's your mama?
All right!
- How you doing there, Brodski?
- I'm all right.
Come on, let's get you
patched up.
Lab two.
- Tsunaron, is he going to make it?
- Absolutely.
He's at 80% already.
What the hell?
Way?
We've got trouble.
The collision must have compromised the hull.
She's bleeding out.
Oh, no.
No, no, no.
Tiamat to grendel.
Do you read? Over.
Tiamat to grendel.
Do you read?
Yes, tiamat, this is grendel.
We read you.
- Can you hear us?
- That's affirmative.
We are reading
your distress beacon.
- Are you in need of assistance?
- That's very affirmative.
How soon can you get here?
Our situation is critical.
We're four parsecs away,
grendel.
We don't have
that much time.
Tiamat, this is grendel.
Our hull is bleeding out.
We're going to have a core
implosion in less than 30 minutes.
Tiamat:
We copy you, grendel.
Advise how you would
like us to proceed.
We're just going to end up
taking them down with us.
Tiamat,
if you can't get here in 30
minutes, then there's no point.
What, are you high?!
Tiamat, this is grendel.
You just ignore
that last idiot, all right?!
You get your ass
out here, okay?
You come here,
and you save us!
Hey, why can't we just
go over here?
It's no good.
If the pontoon goes,
it'll take the bridge
with it.
Not if we disconnect
these walkways.
- You can't just disconnect them.
- We could blow it up.
- There's plenty of macrocharge in the weapons hold.
- This could work.
Tiamat, we're going
to try something here.
If you're game, maintain your
current course and speed,
and hopefully we'll see you
when you get here.
Copy.
See you in 45 minutes.
- Good luck, grendel.
- Thanks.
- Let's blow the walkways.
- Come on.
Let's put up separate charges.
Who's got the remote?
- Right here.
- We'll meet up at walkway b.
- All set.
- Good to go.
Hold together, baby.
Impossible.
It's dead.
I'd say he got better.
He's been modified.
Oh, you think?
- Can you take him?
- I could try.
You guys might want to run.
Kay-Em!
No!
Janessa:
Waylander!
Brodski, get in here, now!
Come on, guys!
Come on!
What the hell
is going on?!
Jason fucking Voorhees,
that's what's going on!
- Blow the charges!
- Waylander's got the trigger!
Hey...
Asshole.
-
-
I think she's holding.
I think we're finally okay.
I'd clap if I could.
Tiamat to grendel.
Come in, grendel.
We have you vectored
for approach
and emergency docking.
You ready to get off
that boat?
Yeah, let's go home.
Holy shit!
We got to go! Now!
Janessa!
- Janessa!
- Don't let go!
Grab her hand!
- Janessa!
- Reach out!
Reach for it!
Come on!
Come on!
This sucks
on so many levels!
Janessa!
Come on!
Come on.
Janessa.
Shit, he's still coming.
Come on. Go!
- Which way?!
- This way! This way!
Come on.
- Tiamat, we're at the evac door.
- So am I, grendel.
Lifeline secured.
Initiate collar
pressurization.
Tiamat, open
the outer doors.
- Brodski: Damn.
- Rowan: What now?
- Tiamat, escape hatch won't open.
- I got this.
I've got this.
Let me try and override.
Shit.
Shit! Shit!
Come on, come on!
Our exterior motor's
got no power.
- What does that mean?
- It means I'm going e.V.A.
- E.V.A., what's e.V.A.?
- It's a space walk.
If he can jump the lines,
we can reroute them in here.
Hopefully that door will open and
we can get off before it blows.
- Sounds like a good plan.
- This is grendel.
Our escape hatch is jammed,
we're going e.V.A. To patch it.
You'd better
get a move on.
- I'm in the maintenance hatch.
- We read you, sarge.
Opening outer doors.
Those hatches aren't going
to keep him out much longer.
We need to buy more time.
You're the expert
on this guy, right?
- What are you thinking?
- A diversion.
I'm at the control
panel.
- Rowan, are you there?
- Yes.
I'm going to divert the main power
supply unit and send it to you.
Gotcha.
See the bright blue diode?
Connect it to the terminal.
-
- Was that you or me?
That was another part
of your hull, grendel.
You are running
out of time.
Okay, just a few
more minutes.
We can disengage
and come around again.
Negative, tiamat,
just another minute.
We'll stand by
as long as we can.
Uh-oh.
- You ready, kay?
- I was built ready, baby.
Initiate.
It's working!
He's buying it!
- Whoops.
- What do you mean, "whoops"?
Nothing.
Not nothing. You don't just say oops.
What oops?
I think he saw me.
If you've got something brilliant up
your sleeve, now's the time to do it.
I got something.
I got something.
Prepare variations using data
file, crystal lake 1980.
- Kay?
- Here goes nothing.
Initiate.
- Hey, you want a beer?
- Or do you want to smoke pot?
Or we could have
premarital sex.
Together:
We love premarital sex.
- Try it now, rowan.
- Here we go.
You piece of crap!
- He's done with the campers.
- Wow, he's good.
He's too good.
He's coming back.
- Okay, try it again.
- It's engaged!
Brodski,
you are the man!
Are we going to see you
sometime soon?
I'm on my way.
Rowan:
Brodski, where are you?!
Grendel, we can't keep pressure lock.
- We'll disengage in 40 seconds.
- Kay-Em.
Kay-Em.
three, two, one...
- Clear!
- No!
- No, wait!
- Disconnect.
He's coming this way.
You've got
to be kidding me.
Brodski.
He's gone.
I can't believe it.
- Tsun?
- Kay-Em.
Are you okay?
I'll be back
on my feet in no time.
- As soon as I have some.
- I'll get right on it.
It's beautiful.
- Look at that.
- A shooting star.
Make a wish.
It landed in the lake.
