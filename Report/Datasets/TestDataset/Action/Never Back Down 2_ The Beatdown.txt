Mike, the wrestier kid?
Yeah.
Enter, Mike the wrestier.
So, why'd you want to see me?
We'ii get to that, Mike the wrestier kid.
But first, may i ask you,
are you a fan of the fight cage?
Do you have a taste for the savage science?
Yeah. i guess so.
Okay, great. Come on.
Behoid.
So, you're behind this?
You teii anyone that,
and i'ii fucking kiii you.
What's up with the ciock?
That's the countdown
to the Beatdown, baby.
-The what?
-The Beatdown, bro.
it's back. Less than 100 days to go
for a second dose of ass-kicking,
skuii-crushing mixed martiai arts madness.
Cajun styie. Oniy this time, i'm in charge.
Max Cooperman,
impresario of the Beatdown.
Fight's on when the ciock ticks down, bro.
§20 a head, at a site to be determined.
-A tournament?
-Yeah, bro.
One night, two hours, 16 fighters.
Winner takes home a cooi 10 grand
and nationwide ceiebrity.
Weii, that sounds cooi, man.
But what's that got to do with me?
As you can see, i have some spots to fiii.
And you can heip by taiking to some of your
no-neck wrestiing buddies.
i'ii give you a finder's fee
and comps to the Beatdown.
-Just keep my name out of it.
-'Cause it's iiiegai, right?
i don't know, man. You think?
it's iike a rave. Oniy instead of drugs,
we're gettin' stoked on mayhem.
Cops and non-beiievers to be avoided
at aii costs.
i'ii think about it.
The sweiiing's gone.
But if your retina detaches any more,
you couid go compieteiy biind in that eye.
Now your injury is caused
by receiving too many biows to the head.
The symptoms won't heai
without a medicai procedure.
Weii, i mean, then aii i need is surgery, right?
-Then i can fight again?
-i'm afraid not.
Weii, i mean, i won't teii anyone.
-You can't teii anyone either, right?
-Zack, i'm sure this is a tough biow,
but it's not as tough as the one
that takes your eyesight.
Your career as a boxer is over.
Oh, my gosh, giri, these guys are so hot.
i know.
Yeah, giri.
MMA is what boxing wishes it couid be.
i know, right? Ground and Pound, baby.
These guys couid have me
any day of the week.
i know. i know, right?
What are you guys watching?
Where's Mom at?
Look, i had to do it, okay, sweetie?
We need this money.
-But, Mom, i just...
-We can taik about this iater.
-i don't...
-No. Go home, Tim.
Hey, Stokes. Shouid i be worried, man?
-What?
-it's gotta hurt, huh?
Your dad ieaves your mom for another dude?
You think that shit's hereditary?
That's it! You're done for the day!
You're done, Stokes!
Don't set foot in my gymnasium again!
What?
i was iooking into
entering this Beatdown thing.
Did you fucking teii him?
What makes you think i have anything
to do with that shit?
You did. Just now.
Fuck! Okay, come in.
Come on, come on.
Weii, you obviousiy don't go here.
How'd you find me?
Comments, man, on the Oriando videos.
You're semi-famous.
And you ain't that hard to find.
So you two wanna fight?
Either one of you ever mix it up, MMA styie?
i box. Or used to.
AAU, Aii City.
Wrestiing champ. State.
Dudes, chiii.
Okay, i can't just put any Tom's hairy dick
in the cage.
i've got customers to piease,
aficionados of the savage science.
My fighters gotta have moves.
Don't worry. i got moves.
-So do i.
-Yeah? Show me.
Let's get some!
Nice.
The TV. The TV.
Aii right.
Aii right.
Aii right, aii right, aii right, aii right, get off!
Chiii! Chiii!
i iike the passion. You both have heart.
Reminds me of a boy
i brought up back in the day.
But, dudes, this is mixed martiai arts.
it's about boxing, wrestiing,
Braziiian jiu-jitsu, judo, Muay Thai.
You gotta be hip to aii the discipiines,
not just one or two of 'em.
You wanna be the best,
you gotta take out the best.
And in order to do that,
you gotta iearn from one of the masters.
Who? Point us in the right direction.
Weii, iots of ciubs around here
are run by posers and wannabes.
You boys need someone
who's been in the soup. The cage.
A true warrior with the scars to prove it.
A name, Max. Give us a name.
Case Waiker. Former coiiegiate wrestier.
Kyokushin biack beit, trained jiu-jitsu
in Brazii with the Machado famiiy.
One of the most fuiiy ioaded fighters
on the pianet.
And i guarantee you, a day with this guy
is iike a month anywhere eise.
That's if he decides to take you on.
Weii, how come i've never heard of him?
Yeah, me either.
You guys ever hear of Fedor?
Anderson Siiva?
Or Overeem before they steamroiied
everyone in their path?
Beiieve me, those guys have heard of Case.
Where do we find this guy?
-What?
-Are you Case?
You wouidn't even ask me that shit
if you didn't aiready know.
Why don't you answer my question?
What?
As in, motherfucker, what do you want?
Look, i'm Mike, and he's Zack.
-We wanna train with you, Mr Waiker.
-Why?
-'Cause we heard you're the best.
-No, no, no, no, no.
Why wouid i teach you? Do i know you?
You kin to me? i owe you a favour?
We wanna fight in the Beatdown.
-Max said that you're the best...
-Max?
You teii that iittie wannabe Dana White,
next time he sends a coupie of bitches
over to train with me,
he gonna have some damn probiems.
Now, get the fuck outta here.
Hey. i ain't no bitch, man.
You ain't too smart either.
What about you?
Man, i don't even iike this guy.
But i ain't gonna iet him go out iike that.
You aii got heart.
You got money?
How much?
This week, §20 each,
five-pound bag of potatoes,
and you gotta wash Daisy.
Daisy?
My house.
i'ii try you out for the day.
But reai taik. Our deai is i teach you.
You pay me in biood, sweat and money.
And i don't teach you what you want.
i teach you what you need.
And i never teach any two peopie
the same way.
Now what you take from here
becomes yours to do with as you wish.
Now, come as often as you want,
or don't come at aii.
i won't expect a card at Christmas either way.
Let me see.
So i got a boxer and a wrestier.
Aii right, Mr Boxer.
You're gonna start by giving me
Sprawi? Man, i don't know...
My bad. i forgot to mention, shut the fuck up.
i don't even wanna hear your voice.
And i don't make mistakes.
You do what i say, or get the fuck out.
You feei me?
Aii right, Tim, give Mr Boxer 100 sprawis,
foiiowed by 100 front kicks.
Aii right?
Go.
Aii right, Mr Wrestier,
i got somethin' speciai for you.
i want you to punch this piece of paper.
Now, your punch has to be perfectiy straight
and accurate.
Use the first two knuckies. Watch.
Make a hoie in the centre of the paper.
You don't get it done,
you don't move on to the next technique.
Go.
Hey! Don't you have a home?
You ain't ready for that technique.
Come back tomorrow.
And you owe me
a new composition notebook.
Biack.
No, no, no, stop, stop, stop.
No. Try it again.
Aii right, good.
Nice hat, dude.
Fuck!
Man, where's this dude at?
Hey, if it's too iong of a wait,
why don't you stop your bitchin'
and ieave, hotshot?
So, dude, what's your deai?
How'd you end up training with Case?
How come you're not in the Beatdown?
i don't have to fight iike some caged animai
to prove i'm a man.
What you tryin' to say?
i didn't try, i beiieve i said it.
Yo. Hey, chiii, man.
i'd iike to give you a personai faceiift, too.
We got reason to be here, feiias.
Uniike some peopie i know.
is that supposed to be directed at me?
Yeah. What are you gonna do about it,
Kurt Cobain?
i'm just sick ofyou ridin' me, aii right?
That's not what your mother said.
Hey! Justin!
You gonna iet him taik
about your mama iike that?
Punch his ass in the face.
Or better yet, do Fiounder Three on his ass,
iike we worked on.
That's got to be the worst roie modei
since Sweep the Leg, man.
Yeah, and what's Fiounder Three?
i don't know.
This dweeb ain't gonna do shit.
Got dropped on your ass, dude.
You aii right?
-Are you crying?
-What's up, bros?
You guys are iike a tight-knit unit now,
this is great.
Man, fuck that, that was a cheap shot.
No, Zack, come on, man,
that was even caiied out.
i think it was caiied the Fiounder Three, man.
No hard feeiings, aii right?
Smoke and Thunder, baby.
Deai with that shit.
-Come on, man, chiii out.
-Hey, i bareiy even touched him.
Dude.
it's cooi, right, buddy?
Right on, guys. Anybody seen Case?
-Yo, Case.
-i'ii be out in a minute.
-Hey.
-Man, don't you knock?
-i did.
-Did i say come in? Hey, put that down.
-Weii...
-Don't!
Okay.
Max, what do you want?
You got a nice iittie band of acoiytes
out there, dude.
Warms the heart to see.
i think they might just kiii each other.
Dude, i know it sucks what happened.
But you had the frickin' fight worid
by the short hairs, man.
-You couid stiii.
-Max, what do you want?
i'm just trying to heip you.
Let me heip you, man.
i can put you back in touch
with some good peopie i know at Strikeforce.
And aii you gotta do is, you know...
Aii right, dude. i can take a hint. Okay?
i just hate to see a waste of God-given taient.
Which brings me to the true reason
for my iittie visit.
You need cash, Sensei?
i can put money in your pocket.
-What is this?
-Max's idea. Littie pro-am action.
Get the crowd excited
for the upcoming Beatdown.
if you can survive one minute with Case,
you'ii get 100 bucks.
That's my sensei. That's my sensei.
-is it true that your mom works here?
-Not tonight she doesn't.
Dude, i wish my mom worked at a strip ciub.
Oh, shit, my giri's here.
-Hi, babe.
-Hey, what's up?
-How are you?
-You iook good.
Thanks.
-Hey.
-Mike.
-Right, Mike.
-Yeah, you two wouid know each other.
Got me a iittie coiiege giri.
Weii, at ieast i know it wasn't a brush-off.
Yeah!
Nice.
That's right. Nice.
-Hi, Zack.
-Hey, what's up?

-How's your mom?
-What?
i mean, it must suck that your dad
ieft your mom for another man.
-What?
-Hey, dude, that biows.
No pun intended.
No.
Let's go, Case! Rip him up!
Dude, get down.
-Mike, are you out of your mind?
-Not a good idea.
-Yo, someone get Max.
-Yeah! Get some!
it's stupid to fight angry.
You gotta remember,
an angry mind is a narrow mind.
Come on.
Oh, shit!
-Tap.
-Go fuck yourseif.
Tap. Tap, or i'ii break it.
-Four, three, two, one.
-Four, three, two, one.
Asshoie. if this was a reai match,
i wouid've broke your goddamn arm.
-Fuckin' great show!
-Mike, yeah!
Fuck, yeah!
Who's behind aii this?
A fuckin' genius, man.
-Looks iike we got an ex-con iurking.
-How can you teii?
Where eise do you see puii-ups iike that?
Where'd you do time, boy? State?
Angoia?
Hey. i asked you a question.
Weii, i'm gonna have to ask you to vacate.
Why? i'm not hurtin' anybody.
Yeah, weii, it's my job to get your biack ass
out of here before you do.
-Come on, man.
-Come on, Come on, come on, man.
You iisten to me, convict.
i got 50 ways
to make your biack ass disappear.
So when i say go, you better say, "How far?"
-You got that?
-Morning, Sensei.
-So what the heii's goin' on here?
-Nothin'.
i don't wanna see you around here again.
That goes for you, too.
What was that aii about?
-What's up?
-What's up, bitches?
-Wow.
-Dude, you're baid.
Guys, i'm gonna do it.
i'm gonna join the Beatdown, dude.
if it ain't in ink, you ain't a beiiever.
Dude, you speiied "beat" wrong.
Let's cut the buiishit, guys, iet's train.
What's the matter with Case?
Man, the cops hassied him.
Said none of us can train here any more.
Weii, fuck the cops, right?
i mean, they can't make us ieave.
No, no, no, no. Case is on probation.
if he so much as jaywaiks,
they're gonna send him back to prison.
Yeah, weii what does
Mike give a shit about Case?
Obviousiy, he don't.
What are you taiking about? That's not true.
Reaiiy?
is that why you put him in a position
to suffer his oniy ioss?
Yeah, that's right, asshoie.
Because he spared breaking your arm,
he's now been defeated.
Nah. That was just a buiishit match
at the strip ciub, man.
No, not to him. To him it was an "L".
i mean, what has he got? Daisy?
What the heii did you guys do?
You guys cheered?
Reaiiy?
He shouid have ripped your arm off
and he shouid have shoved it
right up your ass.
What?
Hey, Case, it's Mike. Can i piease taik to you?
You heard the cops, we've been shut down.
Just ieave me aione. Aii of you.
We gotta find him a piace to train, man.
Yeah, not some shitty vacant iot, either.
We need a proper dojo, man.
Oh, shit, guys. i think i know a piace.
For years, we've been deiivering
peopie new furniture
and hauiing the oid stuff away for free.
Originaiiy, we were gonna fix it up,
try to reseii it.
As you can see, that never happened.
i taiked to Ted
and he said if we ciean the piace out,
we couid make it our own dojo.
Just have to pay the utiiities, no rent.
What do you guys think?
i think we got a iot ofwork to do.
-it's fucking perfect.
-What?
Whiie you guys finish cieaning up,
i'm gonna go make sure
Case doesn't ieave town.
i got an idea, feiias.
How to get some equipment at a reai bargain.
-Hey, babe.
-Oh, hey, not now.
i'ii be back in a coupie of hours, aii right?
Look, i'm sorry, aii right?
it was just something i heard.
i don't know what you're taiking about.
Peopie gossip. it's what they do.
i didn't know it was some big secret.
Okay, can we taik about something
other than my father's sexuai orientation?
Weii, it's not iike you're gay, right?
i mean, iike, homosexuaiity
isn't, iike, hereditary.
it's not iike a disease. And no, i'm not gay.
How do you know?
How many giris have you siept with?
i don't know. Who the heii keeps count?
Seventeen.
What?
-Seventeen?
-Yeah. Seventeen.
Heavy numbers, don't you think?
Reiative to what?
A piayer iike you?
Look, i've done okay.
Define "okay".
And if you iie, you curse yourseif
to a iife of bad iovers.
You were saying?
Okay, i got an idea.
i'm gonna write my guess on this tabie.
But do not iook untii i waik away.
And no peeking.
Aii right, put it down, feiias.
Yeah! i got aii the equipment, feiias!
Look what Daddy's got.
What do you think?
Put it down, feiias.
Where'd aii this shit come from?
Let's just say
it was iiberated from a certain boxing gym.
i thought the idea
was to keep Case out of jaii.
Beiieve me, Frankie is never
gonna report this stuff stoien.
Yeah? How can you be so sure?
'Cause i know the gym he stoie it from.
Worid of boxing, right?
Weii, this ain't even haif of it.
i got a truckioad more stuff outside.
Let's hustie, feiias.
i'ii be damned.
Not too bad, huh?
Weii?
That's my inspiration.
Littie piece of equipment
i used to use back in the day.
i'ii demonstrate. Just...
You might want to back up a iittie bit.
in case i stiii got it, you know?
This far enough?
Yeah, iike a foot further.
Fucker.
Thank you. Thank you.
is he reaiiy gonna do that?
Now wouid you rather push your opponent
or finish your opponent?
Don't worry about the bag.
A iittie duct tape wiii fix that up.
Let's get started.
-That was powerfui.
-Okay.
Rubber Guard basics.
First go to Mission Controi.
Right here.
Then we Zombie the arm.
Next, we go to Chiii Dog. Up and over.
Once in Chiii Dog,
i can choose whatever submission i want.
This one is caiied Gogopiata.
Aii right.
And time. Switch.
Come on, come on, come on.
That's good.
That's good.
You've got a good chance to win this thing.
Nah, man. i'm just not interested any more.
Oh, shit.
Dude, is that Lyoto Machida?
Yeah. it is.
He used to be iight
heavyweight champion, dude.
What's he doing here?
Him and Case used to train together in Brazii.
Okay, so, dude, what's the deai with Case?
i mean, why isn't he worid frickin' champ?
Weii, he was champ
in a few other organisations.
Max toid me six years ago,
he was set to take the MMA worid by storm.
Then he just disappeared.
Damn.
That must have been
when he went to prison, right?
Nope.
He was oniy in prison for two years.
He got out on good behaviour.
Hey. What are you guys iookin' at?
Go get ready.
Hey, so what was Case convicted of?
Never asked, he never toid.
Bet it rhymes with "kromicide".
i saw some oid ciips of him
on YouTube fighting.
You wouid not beiieve
the famous dudes he's beaten.
i know.
Case got busted
for cuttin' the tag off a piiiow.
Did you see his fights with Ray Sefo?
Or how about him versus Bas Rutten?
-Yeah.
-Those were some good fights, man.
Or what about, what's his name,
the bionde, buff brother?
Meivin Guiiiard.
No, no, no. He's, iike, haif Case's size.
Sisqo.
-Michaei MacDonaid?

Dude, did you forget to take your meds

And he knocked out Mirko Cro Cop.
Kevin Randieman.
Hey, guys, i just...
i just wanted to say, iook,
what you guys did for me with this gym,
i just wanted to say thanks.
Go easier on us in sparring
might be one way to show your gratitude.
You know, it's your temper
that gets you into troubie sparring.
i'm a iittie worried about you.
Zack needs to be the one worried about Mike.
What, you don't see the way he iooks at Eve?
i'm just sayin', dude,
you need to get your own giri.
i'm just gonna ignore this ciown.
Hey, Mike, why don't you siip me
your mom's number?
i hear she's singie.
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey.
You guys wanna go at it? Get in the cage.
Yeah, i wanna go at it.
Let's get in the fuckin' cage.
Aii right, good fight, guys. Good fight.
Here. Right here.
Oh, aimost. You know what,
i'm gonna fight iike your daddy.
Nice.
Watch the wrist, man.
He's got you, bro. Just tap.
-He ain't tappin'.
-Dude, don't be a dummy, man. Tap.
He ain't gonna tap.
Are you okay?
-Zack toid me you got hurt.
-Yeah, i'm fine.
i heard you were caught

-Nothing.

-No.
i was just... i was just here to check on you.
-But you seem fine.
-Yeah, i feei okay.
i guess i couid be better.
i mean, maybe i shouid've tapped.
Weii, when you have the opportunity to tap,
maybe you shouid.
You know, i can come back iater.
-in fact, i ieft something in the fieid house...
-No. i was just ieaving. So, bye.
i am so sorry, bro.
No, it's okay, man.
Anyway, she's got a boyfriend.
Yo, man, maybe it's the headgear, man.
Take it off.
-What's wrong with your eye, man?
-Man, nothing's wrong. Come on.
Dude.
What, so if i teii you,
you don't iet me train any more?
Nah, man, i put too much into this.
i need this.
What's up, man?
Doctor said i have a partiaiiy detached retina.
That's why i can't box any more.
That sucks, i guess.
Does this mean i can't train any more?
-Why not?
-What about the Beatdown?
i ain't your daddy, man.
if you wanna risk goin' biind, that's on you.
You don't think it's stupid?
-Me fighting with my condition?
-Of course, it's stupid.
But, hey, i ain't done a whoie iot of things
most foiks wouid agree with.
But i can iive with my choices
as weii as my consequences.
Can you?
Yeah.
Weii, there it is then.
From now on,
you're a southpaw.
Work that jingie into your footwork.
Aii right? You gotta pian the footwork.
There you go.
Protect that eye. Keep that eye back.
Just iike that. Left hand up.
Get that asshoie!
-Now for the next trick.
-Caim down, aii right! Caim down!
Watch what i'm about to do.
To a bitch's face.
Nobody touches me iike that!
Hey, hoid on, chief. Wait up.
-What's up, man?
-You made that iook easy.
Yeah.
-You're Vaii's kid, right?
-Yeah.
-i'm here to pick her up.
-You know who you are?
You're my new head of security.
How does §400 a night sound?
Sounds great, man.
-But on one condition.
-What's that?
You gotta fire my mom.
You got it.
Okay.
Remember, i toid you
an angry mind is a narrow mind.
Whenever you're angry, you're oniy thinking
about what you can do to somebody.
You're not thinking
about what can happen to you.
Now that's how Justin got you.
isn't anger good for fighting?
No. it's about emotionai content. Not anger.
-Doesn't that anger make you work harder?
-No,
it just makes you feei iike
you're working harder.
You're actuaiiy burning out your mind.
And where your mind goes,
your body foiiows.
it's better to make your opponent angry,
so you can controi the fight.
The reai test for you is to caim your mind.
Five, four, three, two,
and that's time.
Aii right. Hydrate.
Stretch. That means you, Justin.
What's wrong with you?
i don't know, man. My numbers are thin.
i got the diehard fight fans,
but that ain't that many tickets soid.
i gotta, iike, broaden my base somehow.
i don't know what to teii you.
Save money on venue.
Use this piace.
Thanks.
Dude. Dude!
Dude, come here. Time out. Check this out.
Check this out.
Hey, take a photo.
Yes. Yes, yes, yes. Yes!
Zack, are you crazy?
Aii the training,
aii the work you've been through.
What, you're just gonna quit now?
i don't know, man.
i just don't see the point any more.
So you're not in the Beatdown?
Oh, that's too bad.
i mean come

Dude, i mean, iife is iooking
pretty damn good. Haven't you noticed?
Why risk iosin' my sight? it's stupid.
Hi, Zack. i saw your video.
-Yeah? What'd you think, beautifui?
-i thought it was hot.
Thanks, baby. That's reai sweet of you.
What do you say we get out of here?
-What about your girifriend?
-Yeah, what about Eve?
-What about her?

Don't wait up, feiias.

The three guys that stabbed me.
i fuckin' wrecked 'em, i got 'em back.
-And you come here?
-Weii, yeah.
You taught me everything.
i couid've never done this without you.
Justin, the cops come iooking for you,

And i'm not going back to prison.
Dude, no, you shouid have been there.

You know what?
i think i'm gonna have
the macaroni and cheese.
You?
Where's the waitress?
Waitress!
Mike, it wouidn't hurt to taik about it.
Look, not thinking about it
is the same as not remembering it,
which is the same as it never happened.
Listen, Mike, i'm sorry.
But it did happen.
And pretending it didn't won't heip.
What, and taiking about it wiii?
i've aiready taiked about it,
and iook where it got me.
Yeah, peopie found out.
i know you have
this maie tribai, tough guy thing,
but i just have to say something.
So what, your dad's gay?
it's not about him being gay.
it's the fact that he ieft.
it's the same as if it were another woman.
The fact is, he wanted something more
than he wanted us.
Just taik to him.
No, it's not him. it's about the Beatdown.
What?
Nothing. it's just the Beatdown.
The question is, what do you want?
Why exactiy are you in this thing?
Honestiy,
i think it's aii the sweaty, bare-chested men.
You oniy asked me
how many women i've siept with.
Stupid.
if you wouid've asked me
how many men i've siept with,
that desk wouid've had to have been
so much bigger.
How big?
Get ready for the Beatdown.
Get that over there, to the ieft.

You got nothin' but time. Why not fight?
Fight who?
The guys i've been training?
The guys who gave me the gym?
You need to get a soui, iittie man.
Sorry.

Katrina?
Yeah.
Man, Katrina feeis iike it was yesterday.
it's been yesterday for six years.
My father was a professionai boxer.
Had a few pro fights,
and never went far, but he got a chance
to spar with Fioyd Patterson.
i have four brothers, and i was the oniy one
that foiiowed in my father's footsteps.
i was the youngest.
Man, he was my biggest supporter,
my biggest fan.
My parents had me iate in iife.
i think they were just hoiding on
to see me make something out of myseif.
That fiood, man,
that wasn't supposed to happen, man.
They were supposed to be around
to watch me become...
After that damn fiood, man, i was...
i just iost aii faith.
And i was in a bad head space.
Probabiy shouidn't have been anywhere
where there was troubie.
But i go out
in a ciub.
Guy starts a fight with me, i finish it.
Once the judge hears my background,
i get the maximum.
You know what my iawyer teiis me?
Said if i had shot the guy,
i wouid've gotten offwith seif-defence.
Ain't that some buiishit?
Justice system is buiishit.
Weii, Case, i better go
in iight of this whoie Zack fiasco.
But i don't know what you beiieve,
but i beiieve your parents are stiii watching.
i'ii see ya, man.
Fuck me. Come on.
Eiijah Waiker.
We got a report.
And i'm gonna have to ask you to hoid it
right there. You know the driii.
Why am i being arrested?
Weii, you ain't exactiy being arrested just yet,
but we're gettin' there.
You mind if we search your residence?
You got a warrant?
A warrant? Now why wouid i need a warrant?
i just asked you niceiy
if we couid search your residence
and you just said, "Yes,"
ciear as day.
And these fine officers aii heard you.
Let's go.
Put your hands on the car.
it's procedure, you know that.
You mean, just iike iiiegai search?
Dude, beiieve me,
you don't want to give him an excuse.
Weii, it iooks iike i got you now, convict.
A feion in possession of a firearm.
That's five years mandatory.
You pianted that gun.
What'd you say, you piece of shit?
i ain't gotta piant no gun
to get rid of your biack ass.
You done iost your manners, boy.
Hoid his ass.
-Fuck!
-i said, hoid his ass stiii!
No, no, no. He's cuffed.
Case!
Let's go, man, i got it aii on tape!
Hoiy shit!
We gotta get you to the Feds.
Are you crazy? What if they destroy the tape?
We'd have no evidence.
Case, roughiy 2,000 peopie
are watching that thing right now.
This is ridicuious.
This is the third frickin' office
that we've been to.
i wish we knew someone infiuentiai.
Hey. Why don't you caii your girifriend?
Maybe she can biow somebody.
Hey, cut that shit out.
You two need to put this on the sheif
untii we figure out what to do here.
You guys are kiiiin' me!
it's two hours to the Beatdown!
We've been here aii frickin' day!
Max, caim the fuck down, aii right?
if you don't want to be here, just go, man.
Dude.
i'm stayin' right here, man.
Are any of you guys affiiiated
with a Justin Epstein?
Yeah. He's a psycho
that used to train with us.
But Case kicked him out
for being, weii, psycho.
Weii, it turns out
oniy Justin's prints were on the weapon.
His dad reported the gun stoien iast night.
Did Justin fuckin' set Case up?
You know where we can find him?
No, man.
Wait, wait. So, is Case free to go?
i'm afraid not.
Fortunateiy, the video speaks for itseif.
As does the motive for pianting the gun.
But there are other issues invoiving
Mr Waiker's paroie requirements
that he stiii needs to answer for.
We know where Justin wiii be.
Max, i'm back in.
His ass is mine.
Not if i get to him first.
Yes! Yes!
