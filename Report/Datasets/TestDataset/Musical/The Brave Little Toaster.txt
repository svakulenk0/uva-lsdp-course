Good morning,
good morning!
That was
"A-Billion-and-One Strings,"
playing one of
your favorite tunes.
At the top of the news
this morning...
there's monkey
business in Utah.
A band of renegade
chimpanzees...
have kidnapped Pulitzer prize-winning
poet Lester Charles.
What's the big idea?
I'm attempting to sleep!!
I doing a broadcasting.
Do you mind?
Whoa,
not in the face!
Uh, the chimps
are protesting...
I've got a mind to reset
your alarm... permanently!
Sorry, folks.
We're experiencing
technical difficulty...
but it's nothing
we can't handle!!
This just in.
Domestic violence erupts
in peaceful cottage!
We'll keep
you post...
Whew!
Can't hear your own thoughts
with all the racket.
Holy mother of Edison!
What were you thinking?
You might have
broken my bulb!
I'm thinking you think too much.
We need wake-up music.
So when it's raining
Have no regrets
Because it isn't raining
rain you know
It's raining violets
Blah!
Va-rooooom!
I'll track you to
the end of this carpet.
Come here.
I'm going to get you.
Wait till I fix
your speaker!!
Rusetti picks it up
and throws.
Cepeda tags,
he heads for second.
Wait till I get
my plugs on you!
The crowd goes wild.
Can you believe those
Brooklyn Dodgers!!
I've got you.
I've got you now.
Ha, ha, ha.
Come here.
You dare to cross foils...
with the greatest Saxon
swordsman in the land?
Have you any inkling who you're dealing with?
Precisely. A total idiot.
If your saber wags as loosely as your tongue...
you'll be run through
in an instant.
Defend yourself,
Sir Lampy of Locksley.
- A blow for Richard!
- Ouch!
- A blow for Marian!
- Ouch!
- A blow for Mario, the garbage man.
- Ouch!
And for the boys
at the delicatessen.
And here's one for
the guys on 5th Street.
No!
Whoa! Ugh!
What's going on?
Who turned out the lights?
Good morning.
Good morning,
Toaster.
- Hey, slots.
- Salutations!
Umph!
- Thanks.
- What's on our lineup today?
What are our
instructions?
What are we
gonna do today?
The same thing we've done
for the last 2,000 days.
Chores!
- Chores?
- It'll be fun.
I'm always
up for fun!
Listen, a broadcast
from Ebbets Field!
It's the top
of the ninth...
I don't understand
how chores could be fun.
Not supposed to be fun.
It's work!
I don't like to work
without the Master.
Well, okay.
If you don't want to work,
why don't we play a game?
- What sort of game?
- What are the rules?
There's only one rule.
You can't stop till
the house is clean.
- Boo!!
- Boo!!
- Boo!!
Gotcha, pal.
Leave it to me.
Hang on to your hats,
you devil dogs...
because the master
bebop blaster...
is gonna give you
a soul injection.

Hey, shhh. Quiet!
It's the blanket!
A car.
- A car?
- A car!
All right,
fellows, steady.
A little to the left.
Careful.
- I'm gonna fall.
- Keep climbing.
You, get that light
out of my eyes!
All right,
a little to the left.
To the right!
There you go.
A little to the middle.
I don't know which
direction the middle is in.
- Can you see?
- Is it him?
Any news?
I'm dying down here.
Is it the Master?
It's him.
He's back!
It's the Master!
Blanky!
Master!
Blanky!
Was it him?
I'm just curious.
I hate being left
in the dark.
I guess we can assume
that it wasn't him.
Let's get back
to work.
Sorry for that
interruption, folks.
We return to our regularly
scheduled program...
at this time.
Whaa-haa-haa.
Cry, weep, wail and sob.
It's disgusting.
Every time!!
Every single...
Give me that stupid picture.
No, no!
- I'll put it away.
- In the garbage!
- You can't!
- Wimp!
- Let go!
- He's not coming back anyway.
He might.
Fact is, there's not enough facts.
Fight breaks out in
peaceful mountain cottage...
shocking world and bringing
Geneva talks to a halt!
- Let me have it.
- You can't.
Oh, no.
Ha, ha, ha.
Ha, ha, ha.
What are you
laughing at?
Absolutely nothing,
nothing at all.
I think he was
laughing at us.
You know something?
You're a bright little lamp.
Oh, thanks.
Hey.
You guys have an attachment
for that kid, don't you?
Yes, he was
our master.
That's real nice.
Any day he might
come romping back...
just come whistling
back through that door...
and everything
will be the same...
real peachy keen.
- Uh-huh.
- It's a possibility.
Well, at least we
try to be optimistic.
Optimistic?
Somebody untie the knot
in this guy's cord.
Why don't you
just shut off?
I'm real scared, Kirby.
Are you going
to suck me to death?
- Hmph!
- What is it with you?
You act like you just came
off the assembly line.
Get this through
your chrome.
We've been dumped,
abandoned.
- But he loved us.
- That's right.
So what?
He has a family.
They move, he moves.
It's a package deal.
But...
He's not coming back,
pure and simple.
Did you talk to him?
They could drive up
any second.
You really think so?
I'm not talking to you.
You have a combined wattage
of five, maybe less.
It's been years.
It's scrap metal time.
Do what you like.
We're not gonna give up hope.
That's real touching.
You're gonna get me bawling
like a baby any time now.
I think
you're jealous.
Sure, I'm jealous of
a bunch of dimwits.
- Dim?
- Yeah!
The Master never
played with you.
Because you're
stuck in the wall!
So, it's back to that
stupid static again.
You think I don't know
what's going on in here?
I know what goes on
in this cottage.
It's a conspiracy...
and every one of you
low-watts is in on it.
Just because
you move around...
you think you're
better than I am.
I was designed
to stick in a wall!
I like being stuck
in this stupid wall!
I can't help it...
if the kid was too short
to reach my dials!
We didn't mean it,
really.
It's my function!!
Don't.
Wait, wait!
- He's gonna blow!
- Yank the cord!
The fuse!
Poor Air Conditioner.
I didn't know
he'd take it so hard.
He was a jerk anyway.
Hey, what's that?
What is it?
A car.
Not another word
about cars.
You said it.
Sounds close.
Just don't even start.
Sounds real close.
Wah, hah, hah!
Stop it!
We're going out
to find him.
- What?
- What do you mean?
Exactly
what I said.
We're gonna go out
and find the Master.
To the city?
No matter what!
How would you propose we're
gonna do that, exactly?
I don't know.
Come off it.
Be serious.
I am serious.
You're insane.
If only we were wiener dogs,
our problems would be solved.
What?
Maybe it was
a basset hound.
You're all insane!
It was a news flash
I picked up about a dog.
In an amazing show
of loyalty and courage...
a terrier named Grover
traveled hundreds of miles...
to be reunited
with his owner.
The poor critter was
accidentally left behind...
on a fishing trip
three weeks ago.
He had to find his way
across rugged mountains...
and scorching deserts
in order to get home.
Little Grover turned out
to be one spunky pup.
If a dog can do it,
we can do it!
But a dog has legs.
Ah, don't be
a wet blanket.
- Legs would help.
- Brains wouldn't hurt either.
- Lay off.
- Pipe down, carpet breath.
I'm going,
with or without you.
I say we stay.
We'll have a new master
when someone buys the cottage.
But I don't want
a new master.
I want
our master.
Well...
what about the
rest of you?
You boys are gonna
need a leader.
Alone, you wouldn't last
for 5 minutes out there.
I used to be
a mountaineer.
Together...
we can stand against
the forces of nature!
Were you really
a mountaineer?
Sure, ask anybody.
Ask Teddy Roosevelt.
We shot moose together
on the Klondike.
You know,
I was thinking...
you guys will need
somebody bright along.
- Good idea.
- Listen to this.
World War II,
the Normandy Invasion...
and who dare but Lampy
to light the way?
You know...
I thought it would be good
to have somebody come along...
who's really... strong.
- And loud.
- And grumpy!
And oblivious
to reality.
Well?
I just know I'm going
to regret this.
- Yippee!
- Hot dog!
Wow, this is
our last fuse.
Good thing we're
getting out of here.
I've always
loved travel.
The open road,
the wind in my face...
the flies clogging
up my grille.
Yeah? How are
we going to travel?
We could all pile
on top of the bed...
and then Kirby
can push us!
No, no.
Hey, what about
the Master's pogo stick?
That's no good.
How about we're
in the refrigerator...
on a skateboard
and Kirby can pull?
No, no. Hey!
- Shut up.
- Shut up!
Let somebody else
try for a change.
Arise, Hassan.
Arise,
oh magic carpet.
We need a longer cord.
We need an alternate
power source, I say.
- I guess this is it.
- Uh-huh.
-
- Blanket?
Huh?
Ready to go?
Yeah, I'm ready.
Okay, Kirby.
Hmm, shag carpet.
Look, Lampy.
From here you can see
the really big lamp.
Wow!!
I wonder where
his switch is?
We are pioneers.
Whoa!
Can't see the road anymore.
Are we going in
the right direction?
I don't think so.
You boys need a navigator.
Navigator?
I'll tune in a radio
signal from the city.
I can take you right there,
lickety-split.
North by northwest.
Watch out for
low-flying aircraft.
- Ow.
- What's wrong?
He stepped on me.
- Did not.
- Did too.
Did too!
Did not!
Hey, come on.
How do you expect us to get
there if you're fighting?
You mean we're
not there yet?
No, not yet.
We got a long
way to go.
Oh, boy,
you're telling me.
Life is like a journey
On the road that's within
Head says you should stay
But your heart says to begin
So you go
But you don't
want to go
Any life worth living
Isn't life just
filled with ease
You just stay forgiving
Through the forests
and the trees
And you'll go
Just where you want to go
Time flies by
in the city of light
Time stands still
in the country
There's no time
for a fuss and a fight
As we travel the land
And I'd
be satisfied
Just to be
not denied
To reside with some pride
While I ride to the city
The city of light
Light shines like a diamond
in the city at night
When that
diamond shines
You know that
everything's all right
But you know
We got a way to go
Let us meet the Master
We don't want
to make him wait
You just keep a-knocking
he will open up the gate
To that city of light
Master is a man
with a plan I can understand
Master is a man
of great reflection
Master is a man who lays
his hand across the land
Master is a man
of our affection
Time flies by
in the city of light
Time stands still
in the country
There's no time for
a fuss and a fight
As we travel the land
And I'd
be satisfied
Just to be
not denied
To reside
with some pride
While I ride
to the city
The city of light
Hey, everybody.
Look!
- A clearing!
- Great.
Spread out the blanket
and have a picnic.
I'm full of stickers.
My bag's full of
thistles and sticks...
and who knows
what else!
Whose idea was it
to come this way?
The lamp's.
Oh, yeah?
Who's supposed to be
the big shot navigator...
Mr. Loudmouth?
Mr. Big Loudmouth.
- Yeah.
- Where are we?
Give me a second and...
listen to this.
It's the top of the ninth,
the bases are loaded...
and Pee Wee Reese
is at the plate.
There's the pitch.
He connects.
Oh, and it's a triple play.
Knock it off!
We should all
settle down...
and try to get
some sleep.
This is my sleeping space.
Nobody crosses this line.
You better not wake us
up at 6:00 as usual.
- Why are you complaining?
You didn't work today.
- Yeah.
Go find your own place
to sleep, fuzz ball.
Watch it.
Are you blind?
It's a line.
Good night!
Come on,
I'm not the Master.
Go snuggle
somewhere else.
I'm trying to
get some sleep.
Go on.
Help!
Don't leave me.
Listen, listen.
What's that?
Over there!
Oh, look!
Light.
I see light!
Croak, croak!!
Croak,
croak!!
Croak, croak!!
Croak,
croak!!
Croak, croak!!
Ribbit.
Ribbit.
That's the same
riff I used...
when I was drumming
for Cab Calloway.
Like this.
Cut that out!
La, la-la-la-la-la, la
La, la-la-la-la-la, la
Booga-booga.
Boodle-boodle.
Get out of here!
Hey fellas,
come look at this.
Whoa!
I'm trying to see.
Look at me!!
Oh.
No, no.
It's just a reflection.
I'm not a flower.
Ribbit.
Come on, help me.
They're killing me.
Leave him alone!
Stop it.
Give me that.
He was chewing
on the Master.
Time to go.
Bye.
Are you sure this is the right direction?
As sure as I am honest.
Then we're definitely lost.
There might be lions
in there.
And tigers
and bears, oh my.
He's such a baby.
Waa-waa!
What's the matter,
Kirby?
Battery's running low.
We should
give it a rest.
Turn out that light.
Do we have
to stop here?
Only for a while.
Just long enough
to lose our minds.
We'll be cannibals
within a few days.
You'll be the first
to go, dial face.
Hey, fellas,
we can stay here.
Look.
What's the matter?
Eaten alive, the poor sap.
Wow, wow!
I thought you
were a goner.
You wish.
We are gonna need
some kind of shelter.
Shelter from the
likes of them.
Come here and say that,
chrome-dome.
- What?
- Oh, sorry.
I meant to say
"vacuous vacuum."
Ladies and gentlemen,
let's get ready to rumble.
In the blue corner,
undefeated champion...
Rocko "The Radio" Ratuno.
Ding!
And there's the bell.
They're on each other
like black on a bowling ball.
Look.
That concludes
our broadcast day.
This is Lowell Winchell
signing off.
Good night, America,
and all the ships at sea.
Thanks.
That's all right.
So, what's this thing
with you and the blanket?
What thing?
All of a sudden you're
being so darn nice to him.
I was just thinking,
and I got this feeling...
that I should be nicer
to him for a change.
And now
I feel better.
- That's weird.
- What's weird about it?
You were never
this nice to him before...
and now you're nice
to him all the time.
I don't know.
I'm just trying to understand,
figure out what it means.
It's kinda
hard to describe.
It's like being next
to a new loaf of bread.
Hmm, let's see.
It's like a warm,
toasty feeling inside.
Like a glow.
- A glow?
- Yeah.
I think I know what
you're talking about.
It's like the feeling I get
when I think about the Master.
That's it.
I remember the first time
my bulb burned out.
I thought,
"That's it.
"It's over.
I'm burned out.
Eighty-sixed.
To the showers!!"
But then the Master
put in a brand-new bulb.
And I just glowed.
That's all
there is to it.
That's very interesting.
Good night, slot head.
Good night.
Blah.
Ahh.
Run.
Aahh. Help me!
Help me!
Toaster!
Blanky!!
- Blanky?
- Blanky!
Where are you?
- Blanky?
- Blanky!!
- Blanket!
- Can you hear me?
The battery's
gone dead!
We're trapped
like rats...
small rats with
no hair and one light.
Blanky!
- Blanket!!
- Blanky!!
Where are you,
you little wimp?
Blanky!!
Lampy!
Blanky?
Where are you?
Blan...
...keey?
Come on, Blanky,
speak up!
Just relax.
You've done enough.
We'll look for him.
I am feeling
burned out.
Listen.
Lamp was awarded
a Purple Heart...
for being wounded
in the line of duty.
Lamps across the nation
were switched off...
for a moment of silence
in respect for his bravery.
Help.
- Listen.
- Help me.
Toaster, Kirby,
I'm stuck.
- I hear him.
- But I can't see him.
Maybe he's calling
from blanket heaven.
He's a puffy yellow angel,
with a knob nose.
He's just stuck,
that's all. Look!
Help.
Hang on tight.
I am.
Don't let the tremendous height scare you.
Hey, watch out.
Come on.
I can't see.
Get off.
Watch out below!!
That was
kind of fun.
Now get off
of my face!
- Thanks, Kirby.
- Great idea.
You saved me.
I knight thee
"Sir Vac."
Cut it out.
I did it
so we could go.
We're wasting time.
What's this?
What's...
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Kirby, no!
Get the cord
out of his mouth!
Don't let him
swallow it.
Switch him off.
Just shorted right out.
Cracked up, snapped,
sold the farm.
- Poor chump.
- How's he look?
Better than you,
actually.
Keep it up, slots.
Carpet-sweeping motions.
He should
come around.
Hey, I think
it's working.
Kirby, can
you hear me?
Wake up.
Wake up!
- Kirby!
- You're all right.
Yeah!
Lay off.
Just lay off!
- What's the matter?
- We were worried.
You gave us
a scare, pal.
There's nothing wrong
with me, pal!
- Just back off!
- Don't be angry.
Keep your antennas,
knobs, and wires...
and rivets
off my chrome!
Who needs you?
Got to drag you
around all the time.
I'd be better off
without you.
But...
Especially you,
you little rag.
So how do we get across
this thing, anyway?
Houdini did this once.
He was out of the hospital
in no time.
That's encouraging.
Okay, Kirby.
Hey, we're not dead.
Yeah? Where's some wood
to knock on?
Toaster, you okay?
Toaster?
Yeah, I am.
Give me some slack.
Oh.
Wha...
Agh.
Aaahhhh!
Yeowwww!
Help! Help!
Damn thee,
thou cursed whale!!
From the depths of hell
I stab at thee.
- Climb on, you idiot.
- Oh, it's you.
Where's Toaster?
He sank.
Are we glad
to see you!
I really thought I'd
turned in my warranty.
Yeah, until
baggy showed up.
I just slipped and
fell in, that's all.
- Ha, ha, ha.
- Sure!
You can't fool us.
We love you.
Like Mrs. Roosevelt
loved her husband.
Here's the shore.
Everybody off.
Listen to this!
This is President Roosevelt...
awarding the vacuum
the Medal of Honor.
Blah!
Ha, ha!
That's funny.
I'm dying.
Where are we?
I can't
believe this.
I'm really sorry.
Oh, come on.
It's not your fault.
Things could be worse,
you know.
- How?
- How what?
How could
they be worse?
They couldn't.
I lied.
Can't you find anything?
I'm lucky my backup
batteries work at all.
I hope we're not
going in circles.
Come on.
Aaah!
I knew I shouldn't
have let you guys drive.
Come on, pull!
Kirby!
This is great fun.
Let's make these outings
a regular thing, okay?
Inflate your bag!
Help me!
Aaah!
Wow, the poor guy
didn't have a chance.
Just ssss,
and that's it.
Don't look now, but you're
about to ssss yourself!
What? Whoa!
Blanky, let go.
Try to untie yourself.
I'm not scared.
Well, that concludes
our broadcast today.
Actually, it concludes...
all future broadcasting
of any sort.
We'll sign off now
with a suitable tune!
Mammy
Mammy, Mammy
I'm coming
Oh l...
I hope I didn't
make you wait
Mammy
I'm coming
O, Lord
Ha, I thought
I heard a radio!
Whoa!
Hmmm.
Do-dilly
yup-bup-bup
Upsy-daisy!
Whoop!!
There you go!!
Good boy, Quadruped.
You remembered
your seat belt.
Ahh.
A customer!
Seems like a nice fella.
Dingy, but nice.
Heh-heh-heh!!
Heh-heh-heh!
Mister St. Peters is
quite an amusing fellow...
isn't he?
Oh, you poor baby.
Your bulb
is burned out.
Here, you can have
one of mine.
Use it in good health...
while you still can.
Hello, compadre...
I am in deep need
of a blender motor.
Ha, ha!
A blender motor?
I got a whole shipment
ofblender motors in last week.
Heaven sent you to me.
I'll have it for you in
Now what did I do
with that blender?
I could've sworn I left
it here a second ago.
I'm getting as
loopy as a polecat...
without any whiskers.
There you are!
I found you.
Gotta move you guys
out of the way.
Ha, ha!
Whoa.
Boy, are you
some lucky guy!!
This was the
last one left.
Heh-heh!!
Heh-heh-heh!!
You never quite know
what he's going to do.
He's so spontaneous.
W-w-well,
how do we escape?
Did you
hear that?
They want to know
how to escape!
Heh-heh-heh!
Watch yourself
Don't fall off of the shelf
You must be
the new boys in town
What's that sound
Is someone moving 'round
Sit down for a spell
You don't look so well
Wait a minute
I feel great
You just leave
yourself to fate
You might as well
just hang around
It's too late
We've got to operate
Just try to relax
It's a house of wax
Oh, I remember
Frankenstein
Shivers up
my spine
Whoa-oh
I'm for getting
out of here
No need to shout
my dear
No-oh
Who will go
to the cellar down below
Trouble is a-bubbling
in the brew
While you're
down there
Mr. Vincent Price
will give you good advice
He'll know
what to do
You just
tell him boo
He will put the voodoo
in the stew, I'm telling you
It's like a movie
It's a B-movie show
It's like a movie
It's a B-movie show
Look at me.
Barf, barf, barf!
I'm a can opener,
a lamp, and a shaver.
Oh, God,
I'm a mishmash!
This is weird
It's much worse
than I feared
I'll close my eyes
and make it disappear
- This is strange
- It ain't home on the range
You just tell St. Pete
that you got cold feet
There goes the sun
Here comes the night
Somebody
turn on the light
Somebody tell me
that fate has been kind
You can't go out
You are out of your mind
It's like a movie
It's a B-movie show
It's like a movie
It's a B-movie show
Ah-ahh
Ah-ahh
Ah-ahh
Ah-ahh
Ah-ahh

Ahhh
Excuse me,
the missus loved the blender motor.
Was wondering if you got
some radio tubes, too.
Sure.
I got a whole shipment of
radio tubes in this morning.
You gotta help me.
I'll do anything!
I can get you bread,
mounds of hot cross buns.
Pull yourself together!
Now what did I do
with that radio?
I could swear I left
it right here...
in this very,
very spot.
What did it do,
get up and walk away?
I really should
drink more coffee.
Aha!
There you are!
Ha, ha!
I got ya!
Bo-bub-bup
Kirby,
what should we do?
I don't know.
Hey!
I've got an idea!
A-hoo!!
Whoa-oh-oh!
Aaah!
See? It worked!
I told you!
I told you!
I knew!
It worked!
Jailbreak!
Jailbreak!
Oh, ooh.
What?
Did I catch you
at a bad time?
Just wondering
if you got my radio tubes.
Wow!
Yee-hoo!
Honey...
are you taking
enough underwear?
Mom, you bought me enough underwear
to stock the whole dorm.
Do you have
enough socks?
I'm not going toJupiter,
I'm going to college.
- It's just college.
- So let me worry a little bit.
I'm your mother.
That's Chris.
We're going to the cabin...
and pick up the lamp
and radio and stuff.
I can use them
at the dorm.
Hi, Rob.
You ready?
Good-bye, Mom!
Take a sweater.
Hey, Plugsy.
- Yeah?
- Did you hear that?
He's taking some old...
stuff to the dorm...
instead of us.
All right, go!!
You're gonna
like this cabin.
Too bad we
have to sell it.
How are we gonna find the Master...
in this big place?
Here it is.
Excuse me...
could you tell us
how to get to...
To, uh...
A113.
This is it.
Go ahead.
He's not home.
We'll have to wait.
Let's wait inside
and relax!
But it's locked.
Luckily, my war training
included inter-appliance codes.
I will simply render
the secret appliance knock...
and we'll be welcomed
by the native machinery.
Stand aside,
my meager companion.
Hiya, pal!
It's them!!
What are
we gonna do?
Should we
let them in?
Shhh!!
All right.
How do ya do?
Tarry not upon
our doorstep.
Please feel free
to enter, all of ya.
Boy, you were
some lucky kid.
Every summer for as
long as I can remember...
we'd be running
all over this place.
I looked her straight
into those big blue eyes.
It was you who
killed Johnson.
Parker found out
and you killed him.
Then you tried
to get me.
It's your turn,
sweetheart.
Now you're
taking the fall.
There was a shot!
A puff of smoke!
We ran like
the dickens!
- And that's how we got here.
- Wow!
Well, something like that.
And all on
your own, too.
How convenient.
I mean...
- Remarkable.
- Yeah.
Junkyard refugees...
- in this house.
- What's the world coming to?
I wouldn't sew a stitch
on that raggedy blanket.
If you could
call it a blanket.
- Looks like an old diaper.
- It smells.
- It's raggedy.
- Get that thing away from me.
- Did someone wash that thing?
- No.
Yuck.
I'm nauseous.
Oh, how do you do?
How do you do?
Hey, look at this!!
Boy!!
He sure has grown.
What a heartbreaker!
He graduated, too!
Of course!
He knows how to work hard.
He's all big now.
- I hope he still needs us.
- Still needs you?
That's the silliest thing
I ever heard!
If it isn't
old rabbit ears!
If it isn't
old loudmouth!
- Hi, TV!
- How ya doing?
I've got a few
more seasons left.
The cottage wasn't the same
after they took you away.
Yeah,
it wasn't as noisy.
I see you
haven't changed.
Kind of gives you
a sense of security.
Where's the Master?
No one told you?
Is he gonna be surprised
when he gets back!
He just left to
drive out to the...
- Hey!
- What's the idea?
Oh, many pardons.
Was you watching
that channel?
Come on in.
It's the greatest,
isn't it?
You guys sure did some weird
stuff with your furniture.
What happened?
This is... Gee!
Somebody trashed
the whole cottage!
You big dumbo.
Didn't you lock
the doors?
I don't believe
I've ever seen...
quite so many
smiles before.
I've never seen
contraptions with so many...
buttons and knobs
and dials before.
Naturally.
We are on the cutting edge
of technology.
- Wow.
- What does that mean?
I don't know.
What does that mean?
Since you came here
uninvited
We all knew
you'd be delighted
This is not the time
or place to hedge
No one here
would be so bold to
But since you asked
and no one's told you
Let us take you
to the cutting edge
I can process words
accounting too
And my pixel screen
displays for you
Computer graphics
locked into your memory
With fiber optics
cast in plastic
For natural sights
and sounds fantastic
Just reach out and talk
to your dear old uncle Emery
More, more, more
Everything you wanted
and more
More, more, more
Let me tell you
what it's for
Here's the printout
with the score
Get yourself together
on the edge
Ooo-ahh-ooo
You want to go to old
Rio deJaneiro, my dear
You want tojoin in
any Club Paradise
You'd rather stay at home
where the picture is clear
You get it on the stereo and
you don't even have to go
More, more, more
Everything you wanted
and more
More, more, more
Any time
or place you wish
You might meet up
with some dish
Pull yourself together
on the edge
If you want a lean machine
to whip up some mean cuisine
I'm on the scene
totally automatic
I can bake your
biscuits too
Pop some dough boy
out for you
I'm micro solid-state
and that's no static
More, more, more
Everything you wanted
and more
More, more, more
We're the bytes
and chips to call
You just have
yourself a ball
It's all hyperactive
on the edge
From LEDs to CRTs, woofers
tweeters, antenna trees
An ultra-nylon
life of ease
Everything you dreamed of
on the edge
- And more!
- And more!
Where's the toaster?
Where's the vacuum?
Whoa!
What's going on?
Where's the radio,
the lamp and blanket?
Whoa!
I'm glad the Master
has such good appliances.
Yeah, couldn't get
any more modern.
They're wonderful.
Honey, take some of our things.
This lamp would look
so cute in your dorm room.
Go for it.
What are you
going to read by?
I'll buy
some candles.
I won't read.
I'll go out.
I'm not gonna
take your stuff.
I'll just pick up a few
cheap things this afternoon.
That's right,
ladies and gentlemen.
Appliances,
cheap appliances...
available now at
Ernie's Disposal.
Where's a good bargain
place around here?
You should have gone
for the new stuff.
Oh, were you
in line first?
After you,
of course!
Pardon me!
I can't take this
kind of pressure
I must confess
One more dusty road
Would just be
a road too long
Worthless
I just can't
I just can't
I just can't seem
to get started
I don't have the heart
to live in the fast lane
All that is past
and gone
Worthless
And there ain't nothing
you can do about it!
Pardon me
while I panic!
Worthless
Worthless
Worthless
No, that place
is too expensive.
Cheap!
We're talking
real cheap!
What about Rooney's
down on 53rd?
They've got used
vacuums and junk.
This just in.
Rooney's vacuums
found to be...
carcinogenic in
recent lab tests!
Big, big tumors
on those rats.
We've got photos
to prove it...
and I don't even
want to look at them.
I come from
K.C., Missouri
And I got my kicks
on Route 66
Every truck stop
from Butte to M.O.
Motown to old Alabama
From Texarkana
and east of Savannah
From Tampa
to old Kokomo
Worthless
I once ran
the Indy 500
I must confess
I'm impressed how I did
And I wonder how close
that I came
Now I get
a second sensation
I was the top
of the line
Out of sight
out of mind
So much for
fortune and fame
A bargain
in every buck!
A buck in
every pocket!
A pocket in,
uh, every trouser!
Ernie's Bargain Circus...
where you ride
the Ferris wheel of values...
toward a better tomorrow.
Once took a Texan
to a wedding
Once took a Texan
to a wedding
He kept forgetting
his loneliness
Letting his thoughts
turn to home and return
I took a man
to a graveyard
I beg your pardon
It's quite hard enough
Just living with the stuff
I have learned
Worthless
Let's go cruising and
see what we can find.
Why wander endlessly through
the sprawling wasteland...
they call the city...
when your dreams
are all under one roof?
Our roof,
corner of 3rd and E.
Crazy Ernie's
Amazing Emporium...
of total
bargain madness!
Ha-ha-ha!
Ha!
Have you ever heard
of this place before?
Looks pretty neat.
Once drove
a surfer to sunset
There were bikinis
and buns filled with weenies
Fellini just
couldn't forget
Pico, let's go
up to Zuma
Pico, let's go
up to Zuma
From Zuma to Yuma
the rumor was
I had a hand
in the lay of the land
Get up and go
hit the highway
Ooo-ooo
I worked on
a reservation
Ooo-ooo
Who would believe
they would love me
And leave on a bus
back to old Santa Fe
Once in an
Indian nation
I took the kids
on the skids
With a Hopi was happy
to lie in the shade
You're worthless
This sure doesn't
look like...
Crazy Ernie's Amazing Emporium
of total bargain madness.
- It's the right address.
- Hmm.
Oh!
At least we'll
all go together.
That's looking at the
bright side, isn't it?
The Master's down there!
Look!
- It's him!
- What? Where?
Why look,
it is him!!
Maybe he still
needs us!
Yeah!
Chris?
Hey, these are
hard to find.
This is me.
What?
I can't hear you.
I don't get it.
There he is.
I can't believe it.
Freeze.
Here he comes.
You jump off one side,
I'll jump off the other.
Okay, I got it.
Which side?
- Right side.
- Okay.
I'm glad we don't have
to do this every day.
Look!
Hey Rob,
come here.
What?
Doggone it!
- He's coming back.
- He'll see us this time.
Run!
This looks just
like my old blanket.
I think it is
my blanket.
That's my radio.
Hey, Chris!
And the lamp!
Hey, Chris!
Wait a minute!
These are mine.
Let go!
Whoa!
Let me down!
Aaah!
Chris! Help!
Where are you?
Rob?
Chris!
Aaah!
Whew!
Would you cool it?
Get down here.
You're scaring me
to death.
Really now.
Why don't you just
buy a new one?
Where could I find another
toaster like this?
Like that?
Probably nowhere.
Ah-ha!
Bye, Mom.
I love you.
I'll call you tonight.
You forgot your sweater!!
We did good,
didn't we?
Yep, we did good.
You know,
I've been thinking.
This college business
seems like a good idea.
I can absorb a lot
of interesting facts.
I'm picking up a news flash!
President Roosevelt has declared
today a national holiday...
in honor of those five amazing
appliances we've heard about.
So lock up the office,
take down the top...
and open that
rumble seat!
Last one to Coney Island
is a party pooper.
From the starlight roof
high atop the Ritz...
we wish our intrepid
little friends...
the best of luck...
and a fond farewell!
Ah, you're all
a bunch of junk.
