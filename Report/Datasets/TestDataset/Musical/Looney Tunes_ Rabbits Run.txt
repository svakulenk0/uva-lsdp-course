What's...? I say, what's our status, boy?
It's Cecil the Turtle.
There wasn't enough room
for "the Turtle"...
...so it just says Cecil,
but I am a turtle.
I don't care
if you're the Loch Ness Monster.
Wha...? You should care.
Are they in position or not, son?
Uh...
Uh...
Uh...
Now they are.
There she is.
The elusive
Blooms once every 200 years.
And today's... I say,
today's our lucky day.
Commence Operation Flower Grab.
Commence Operation Flower Grab.
Operation Flower Grab.
Who came up with that name?
That was me.
You're fired.
Huh? Aw.
- Oh. What happened?
- I'll tell you what happened.
Someone just got to the world's
most powerful weapon before we did.
I say someone just got
to the world's most powerful weapon...
Okay, we heard you the first time.
Excuse me?
Oh. Sorry. Didn't see you there.
I was just taking my lunch break.
Actually, that's not true.
I was sleeping under the counter.
That's only because my boss doesn't give
me a sleep break, which I think is weird.
- I'm sorry, did you need something?
- I'd like to buy this perfume.
Ew, really? You wanna buy this?
Why? Is it bad?
No, it's not bad. It's just...
Well, it's fine.
I mean, sure it's got some jasmine, a hint
of vanilla, maybe a little sandalwood...
...but does this move you?
- What do you mean?
- A scent needs to transport you.
It needs to caress you, evoke memories,
make you feel like you're not alone.
A scent should envelop you,
take care of you, love you.
Does this scent do that for you?
I need to call my therapist.
Come again.
WOMAN: Oh!
What on earth do you think you're doing?
Your job is to sell perfume.
Uh, this isn't perfume.
Oh, here we go.
It isn't.
You don't think any perfume
is good enough.
- Mine will be.
- Don't tell me you're clinging to the idea...
...you're gonna create
the most beautiful fragrance...
...take it to Paris and sell it
to the House of Moufette?
That's exactly what I'm gonna do.
Lola, the House of Moufette is the
preeminent perfumery in the industry.
They're not interested in a little shop
girl who makes perfume in her bathtub.
I make them in my sink, okay?
The bathtub is where I keep my sweaters.
I have a very teeny apartment.
I keep my shoes in my stove.
My freezer's full of sunglasses.
I don't care. Just like the House of Moufette
is never gonna care about your "perfume."
It doesn't matter that Giovanni
doesn't believe in me.
All that matters is that I believe in me.
Is that right?
Or is it I believe in myself.
Is it I believe in I-self?
No, that's definitely wrong.
I'm gonna stick with I believe in me.
I'm gonna clear the room
Of gloom and doom
I know that my fragrance
Will make a real difference
Then I'll take the odor
From a four leaf clover
Sandalwood sure smells good
When you blend it with apple pie
A hint of some geranium
This toilette is eau so fine
Like a butterfly, if butterflies smelled like
Puppies and forgiveness and wishing wells
I've got a smell in my mind
And I'm gonna let it loose on the world
I know that my fragrance
Will make a real difference
I've got an itch to find a witch
And harness all of her powers
We'll fly on her broom
To the top of the moon
I think there are flowers on the moon.
I'm not 100 percent sure,
but I'm 90 percent sure. Okay, maybe 80.
I'll take my fragrance to
The United Nations
All the leaders of the world
Will be in the room
Then I will spritz my fabulous
Signature smell
And they'll forget for a sec
Why they don't get along
And they'll find peace
Through my perfume
I mean, let's be real, I don't get how
diplomacy works, but I think this could work.
I've got a smell in my mind
I'm gonna let it loose on the world
I know that my fragrance
Will make a real difference
You're fired.
Okay. Fired.
Ooh. Didn't see that coming.
But it's okay. That's in the past.
It's just gonna make it that much sweeter
when my dream really does come true.
Wait a second. That's in the future.
Okay, stay in the present, Lola.
There's tons to be grateful for
here in the present.
Like what? I can't think of
anything to be grateful for.
I feel like my world is collapsing.
I can't breathe.
Whew.
Okay. Okay. I gotta think of
one little thing to be grateful for.
I know. It's a beautiful, sunny day.
Really?
Hey!
Hey!
What's up, doc?
Oh, no, I'm not a doctor.
I'm a perfume salesperson.
Well, I used to be. I just got fired.
Sorry to hear that. Where to?
- Home, please.
- Address?
You know what? It'll be easier if
I direct you. Just head downtown.
Okay, take a left up here.
It'll be quicker, I promise.
Okay, now a sharp right.
Good.
Alrighty, turn left into this alley.
- Really?
- Yeah. Just gun it through.
Okay, give me a second.
I just wanna get a lay of the land.
Okay, we're good.
- Now you're gonna wanna make a U-turn...
- Are you sure you know where you're going?
I think I know how to get home.
I go there every day.
Okay, go right over here.
You're gonna want to turn around, sorry.
Left, left, left, one more right.
I don't know this area.
Can you just do a quick U-turn?
And we're here.
BUGS:
Which boat is yours?
Wait a second.
This is where I used to live.
Lola, you're not a barge captain anymore.
- You were a barge captain?
- Yeah, for seven years.
Or was that I dream I had?
Anyway, you probably need to make
another one of those U-turns...
...because I live really far from here.
And that's all I'm gonna say.
You're the cab driver,
I'm gonna let you do your job.
You are not gonna hear
another peep out of me.
Not gonna say another single word.
What's that picture?
That's where I used to live.
In fact we're actually right next to it.
There you go. That's where it was.
Until the city decided the one thing
it needed was another high rise.
Wow. I can tell this is
really, really very hard.
Very emotional.
So I'm not gonna ask you
any more questions.
What made you decide
to become a cab driver?
Are you kidding? It's great.
I'm my own boss,
I choose who I pick up, who I don't.
Sometimes I make the wrong choice.
Doesn't it get lonely?
Driving around
with a bunch of strangers?
I like it that way. It's like being
invisible in a city full of millions.
That'll be $24.97.
I didn't charge you for
your little shortcut.
Oh, my gosh, that is so nice of you.
- Ah. Oh, no.
- What?
I must have left my purse at work.
Don't worry, I have money upstairs.
I have a cash jar.
That I keep in the microwave.
It's a really small apartment.
B-R-B. Promise.
You better. The meter's running.
What? Where's my cash jar?
Ah. That's right, I kept accidentally
cooking it so I moved it to my hat drawer.
Seriously?
Lola, I've been your landlord
for five years.
When are you gonna stop screaming
every time you see me?
Sorry. I just never get used to it.
I got something for you.
Speedy, I'm so touched.
I know how much you like flowers
and smells and that stuff.
So I was in Mexico,
and I thought I'd pick it up.
- When were you in Mexico?
- Oh, about a half hour ago.
It's beautiful.
Legend says it only blooms
once every 200 years...
...high atop the Sierra Guadalupe.
It bloomed today.
That smell...
It's so inspiring.
It's perfect.
Oh, don't mind me, I'll let myself out.
Don't offer me a glass of water.
It's not like I ran 2500 miles
carrying an object three times my size.
No big deal.
Remember, rent is due tomorrow.
You're not listening.
I'll be back saying, "Where's your rent?"
You'll say, "I forgot. Sorry, here it is."
We do it every time.
Whatever.
Remember, rent is due tomorrow.
Well, I can afford to wait,
but I'm not sure she can.
Is it a drone?
If it is, it's faster
than any drone we've got.
We can't... I say we
can't lose that flower.
We've mapped the trajectory
and know where it ended up.
Russia? China?
New York City.
to be exact.
- We've got her.
- Her?
Get me Fudd.
Here's Fudd.
I thought I fired you.
You can't fire an intern.
FOGHORN:
Hello... I say hello, Fudd.
Now, just listen up a minute, son.
I say I got... I got a little problem here.
There's been a development.
I don't have the flower...
...but I know who does.
Hmm.
That clove's coming on a little strong.
A little clove goes a long way.
All right, let's see here.
Maybe just a smidge of geranium.
Mm, mommy, that's nice.
I have the rabbit in my sights.
FOGHORN:
Still there.
Okay, son, stick with her
like a tick on a coonhound.
- What?
Okay, I've got the base where I want it.
And now the secret weapon.
Here goes nothing.
OMG.
OMG.
I did it. I created my fragrance.
She did it. She created invisibility.
Well, what are you...?
I say, what are you talking to me for, son?
Get in there.
It smells so good.
Oh, I can't believe it.
Everyone's gonna want this.
Ooh. Ow! Right in the eye.
Ooh, that really stung.
They'll have to put a warning on the
bottle: "Close eyes before spraying."
Ooh, I wonder what the bottle's gonna
look like. I wonder what I'm gonna call it.
Ooh! This perfume's gonna be huge.
Who could that be?
That poor cab driver.
Sorry, I'm coming.
I got a little sidetracked creating
the world's most beautiful fragrance.
LOLA:
Ah!
Whoa! Ah!
Ooh!
Ugh!
Drive.
I drive when I decide to drive.
I just decided to drive.
Huh?
You wanna tell me what is going on?
You wanna know what's going on?
I'll tell you.
- I'll tell you what's going on.
- Can it be sometime today?
The cosmetics industry
is made up of sharks.
Not actual sharks, that would be weird.
It'd be amazing though.
Sharks never stop swimming
so they'd never stop making cosmetics.
What does this have to do
with being shot at?
Ten minutes ago I created
the most beautiful fragrance.
I know that sounds braggy but it's a fact.
I know perfume.
And I also know that this bottle
is worth millions.
Maybe billions.
And everyone who's anyone
in the beauty industry is gonna want it.
I bet they were spying on me
from the apartment across the street.
No one was spying on you.
I've been working on creating
this fragrance for years.
Surely I'm on everyone's radar
in the cosmetics industry.
- I'm probably being bugged right now.
- Oh, no. I'm the one being bugged.
Okay, you know what? Drive to Paris.
You can't drive to Paris. You have to fly.
Then take me to the airport.
I'm not taking you anywhere.
Please. I have to get this to the House of
Moufette before someone steals it from me.
You're gonna have to get there
with someone else's help.
Argh. Is this about the money I owe you?
What was it, 20 bucks?
- You're not gonna help me over 20 bucks?
- Not that I'm counting but, uh...
Good thing I'm gonna be rich.
Look, I promise I'll pay you. Aah!
There's a bank. We can do it right now.
- Trust me, this isn't about the money.
- I insist.
My mother taught me,
"Always repay your debts."
Or was it "brush your hair before bed"?
No, because these are my ears.
It was always repay your debts.
BUGS:
Whoa!
We can assume they're working together.
They have the same last name so they're
probably a husband-wife crime team.
Or brother-sister.
I'm just saying.
Well, whoever they are
they're about to be famous.
REPORTER : The suspects are
at large and considered dangerous.
The State Department is offering
a reward of $500,000...
...for any information
leading to their capture.
"Give me all your money
and no one gets blasted to smithereens."
Smithereens?
She ain't gonna know what that is.
These are city folk. Hmm.
Maybe "bits."
"Blasted to bits."
That's got a ring to it.
Course it's a squirt gun.
Come on, Sam, don't doubt yourself.
"Blasted to bits" it is.
Is that right? That don't look right.
Next customer.
Hold your horses, girlie.
That don't look right either.
I'm running out of room here.
- Uh, sir?
- Dad-gummit.
You can't rush a bank robbery.
MAN: What?
REPORTER:
Uh, I mean...
Do you want it in 50s or 20s?
Or a bunch of 10s? I love a 10.
Maybe you're more of a coin guy?
Coins jangling in your pocket?
I don't care. Whatever.
TELLER: Next customer.
LOLA:
Uh...
- Okay.
- We gotta get out of here.
LOLA:
Huh? Huh?
Huh? Ooh.
Huh?
LOLA:
What about your money?
Get in the cab.
SAM: You're not a-going anywhere.
Now get in the truck.
I thought you just said
we're not a-going anywhere.
- What?
- You said "You're not a-going anywhere"...
...so do you want us to go anywhere
or not a-go anywhere?
Ooh! Then I mean go anywhere.
And by "anywhere" I mean "my truck."
My lord, I've known you
all of two seconds.
It feels like you've been
bugging me my whole life.
Imagine how I feel.
Is that you on those mud flaps?
It was a side business.
I took a bath on those things.
- You want a set?
- I'm good.
Get in.
DISPATCHER:
I gots the two most wanted rabbits
in the country, and I wants my 500 grand.
Times Square.
Right in front of the bank I was gonna rob.
Forget that last part.
That's impressive response time.
Hand over the rabbits.
Hand over the money.
You'll get your reward
when we have the suspects in custody.
Suspects? What are we suspected of?
We're not a "we." I don't know what you're
involved in, but I haven't done anything.
Nice try, government man.
I wants my money first.
You don't know what you're dealing with.
You'll get your reward, I promise.
Oh, like the IRS
promised not to garnish my wages?
They a-garnished them.
Now give me my 500 G's.
Forget about the money, what she's got
is the most valuable thing on the planet.
Well, that's very flattering.
Most valuable thing on the planet?
Then the price just went up.
I wants a zillion dollars,
and I wants it now or I'm a-gonna shoot.
- What?
- What?
It's just a water pistol.
But I'm a-feeling boxed in.
And when I'm boxed in
I gots to shoot my way out.
Yee-ha!
Yee-ha!
Hmm. Guns really do have a way
of escalating a situation.
Hello?
It's me. You seem to have left
your purse here when I fired you.
Oh, thank goodness.
Giovanni, listen to me.
I did it.
I created my perfume and it is perfect.
I'm trying to get to Paris
but everyone's after me.
I always knew
the cosmetics industry was cutthroat...
...but I thought that was an expression. Whoever
it is, they're willing to kill me for it.
Lola, no one's trying to kill you
for your fragrance.
Oh, really?
Call the House of Moufette, tell them
Lola Bunny has their next fragrance...
...and she is on her way. Ah!
Is this the House of Moufette?
I'm calling to let you know
that your next big fragrance is on its way.
Who created it?
That would be me: Giovanni Jones.
Now I just need to find Lola.
- Come on.
- Sure you don't have to make another call?
Whoa!
What, are you crazy?
Trust me, okay? I know my way around
the New York City sewage system.
I know I'm gonna regret asking this,
but why?
Okay. Well, about a year ago
I read on the Internet:
"Ten surprising foods
that will supercharge your day"...
...and one of them was hotdogs.
So every day I would stop
at the same hot-dog vendor...
...and get a hot dog.
But then one day I read:
"Ten unsurprising foods
no one should be eating"...
...and hot dogs were number one.
Well, obviously I couldn't
keep eating hot dogs...
...but I still had to walk past
the hot-dog vendor to get to work.
I just couldn't face him.
His sad little hot-dog-vendor face.
But that was the only way to get to work.
- Or so I thought.
- So you took the sewer to work?
Mm-hm. No fuss, no muss.
Well, actually a lot of muss.
Tons of muss.
Okay, we're gonna have to get down
on our bellies for this part.
Heh, heh, heh. No, no, no. I'm not going
anywhere until you tell me what's going on.
I told you. They want my perfume.
It's gonna be the most popular fragrance
in the world.
It'll be everywhere.
That's all that matters.
I don't care about the money.
You can have it.
- I don't want your money.
- Are you sure?
You'd be able to buy that building
and tear it down...
...and go back to living in that
little hole and being alone.
Isn't that what you want?
- Yes, but...
- Then come on.
- Lola, listen to me.
- Whoops.
Lola, those were the feds back there.
The feds don't want your perfume.
You're obviously mixed up in something
that you don't understand.
But whatever it is, it's big.
Bugs, I told you.
The cosmetics industry
is a billion-dollar industry.
How am I gonna get that perfume?
She could be anywhere.
BUGS: I promise you this has nothing to do
with the cosmetics industry.
No one, and I mean no one, is trying
to steal your perfume and take it to Paris.
I'm off to Paris.
My perfume.
Giovanni's got my perfume.
We've got to stop him.
No way. I'm done.
Look, you're on your own.
Come on, come on.
Green means go.
Oh. Ha-ha-ha.
I'd rather take my chances with the FBI
than follow you from one mess to another.
Well, I have to get my perfume back.
That is one nutty rabbit.
You're not gonna go after her.
Oh, brother.
Taxi!
Follow that van.
Whoa, man.
I don't give people rides.
What are you talking about?
This is a taxi.
But it's for my transportation needs only.
- How do you make money?
- My salary.
Taxi drivers don't make a salary.
You only make money
by giving people rides.
Ah, that's why I'm broke.
All right, where to?
Follow that van!
So where are you from?
Are you crazy?
Legally? No.
There's not a word for my condition.
Coming up on your left
you'll notice the famed Statue of Liberty.
- That's the Empire State Building.
- Well, it has many nicknames.
Right up here on our right you're gonna get
a glimpse of the majestic St. Louis Arches.
There's just the one.
And it's in St. Louis.
See, this is why I don't give rides.
That'll be $7000.
What?
You never even turned the meter on.
I don't know how to work that.
I do it in my head.
Wait here.
Where are you going?
To see if they have a bathroom.
I'm on this crazy, Internet, hot-dog diet.
Ugh. Just a little burbly.
CECIL:
She says she doesn't have it.
She says someone named Giovanni has it
and he's on his way to Paris.
Eliminate her?
LOLA: Hm?
Oh, well, I didn't know we'd be
eliminating people, but that's fine.
Okay, I understand.
But maybe I should be paid a little more
than we agreed on...
...because eliminating people
is definitely a very illegal activity...
...and I'm not very comf...
Oh, okay, so my life could be in jeopardy
and you'll have me eliminated?
I understand.
Well, in that case, I think we can
stick with the original deal.
Hello? Hello?
Hm. Doesn't even say goodbye.
All right. Eliminate her.
I'm just curious, um, how much
are you guys getting paid for this?
Oh, you don't wanna tell me?
I just wanna make sure
we're all getting the same amount.
Fine. Don't tell me.
But all I know is, I'm not getting paid enough
to watch someone get smelted in a smelter.
Now, let's get ourselves to Paris
and find this Giovanni.
- Over there.
- The bathroom?
BUGS:
Shut off the machine!
Hm.
How's that?
That's not it.
DAFFY:
How about now?
Nope.
How's this?
BUGS:
Not great.
DAFFY:
Oh, I bet it's this one.
Doesn't one of them say "on-off"?
Yeah.
Well, could you press that one?
Ah.
Oh, Bugs. I just knew you'd save me.
Not as much as I knew I'd get smelted...
...but I pretty much really was hoping
you were gonna save me.
And you did.
You mean "we." Daffy Duck.
Sorry about the wet hand. Just washed them.
Found the bathroom. Surprisingly nice.
Come on, we have to get to the airport
and find Giovanni before they do.
An airport run?
This guy already owes me $7000.
SAM:
Now wait a doggone second.
You're a-telling me
that not only do I get no reward...
...I'm a-getting charged
with attempted bank robbery?
Be quiet.
Yes, general.
I'm afraid we lost the rabbits.
First off, why is
"attempted" bank robbery illegal?
If I just attempted it,
it means I didn't get it done.
Do you see me sitting on piles of money
from the bank I robbed? No.
Because I didn't rob it.
I was just attempting it.
And you're the only reason
them rabbits got away.
I'm well aware
this is a matter of national security.
SAM:
Ugh.
Hey, government man.
Yes, sir, we're looking everywhere, sir.
Baldy.
Coming up on our left
you'll notice the Washington Monument.
That's in Washington.
Is that that hillbilly leprechaun
that tried to kidnap us?
Huh?
- Step on it.
- Okey-dokey, but it's gonna cost you extra.
- What about the airport?
- Right now we've got bigger fish to fry.
Speaking of fish, if you'll look to your
right, you'll see the famed Fisherman's Wharf.
There's Old Faithful.
Ooh. Look at that. The Space Needle.
Well, look at that.
- Ha, ha. Remember the Alamo.
- Ah!
Huh?
Hoo-hoo-hoo. It's easier this way.
Nope. Harder.
BUGS: Come on. We can lose them in here.
- Oh, great idea.
- Why are you coming?
- It's not every day...
- ...a person gets to see the Grand Canyon.
- This is Central Park.
I thought that was in Michigan.
Bugs.
This way.
Climb in.
Aw. So romantic.
I didn't know
you thought of me in that way.
I'm not gonna lie,
there's obviously some chemistry here...
...and you are easy on the eyes.
Sorry, doc, we gotta get to the airport.
Oh, right, yeah, airport.
Let me ask you something.
These ducks, they just live here?
Rent free?
Meals, everything taken care of?
Interesting.
Unbelievable.
Never got my one phone call.
Who would I call?
I don't have anyone to call.
But that's not the point.
Point is you get a phone call.
Well, well, well.
Finally these little doll's hands
is good for something.
BUGS:
Are you kidding? Oh, brother.
There he is.
One ticket to Paris, please.
- Come on.
- What do you think you're doing?
- Duh. We have to get on that flight to Paris.
- Paris, eh?
We're wanted criminals.
We try and buy a ticket, they'll arrest us.
- Well, then what are we supposed to do?
- Hm.
I think I've got an idea.
SAM:
One ticket to Paris.
Down here.
Oh, I'm sorry.
That'll be $2165 dollars and 38 cents.
I don't want to buy the plane,
I just want to ride on it.
Durn, I regret not robbing that bank.
How am I gonna get on that plane
without a ticket?
Ugh. That's the last time
I take the Van Wyck.
Okay, you two get us tickets to Paris...
...I'm gonna pop into the duty-free shop.
What?
I need some bronzing powder.
CECIL:
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Can someone tip me over, please?
Anyone?
Someone? Anyone?
I know you can see me. Hello.
BUGS :
Welcome to flight 418 nonstop to Paris.
Our flight time is approximately
seven hours and 16 minutes.
Dinner will be served shortly,
so sit back, relax and enjoy your flight.
Okay, you know there are
male flight attendants.
Yeah, but I like the height
the heels give me.
- How will we get the perfume?
- He's gotta go to the bathroom.
- We'll get it then.
- What if he never uses the bathroom?
It's a seven hour flight.
Maybe we need a little insurance.
Here you go. One jumbo oat bran muffin
with a side of dried prunes...
...a couple boxes of raisins,
some assorted melon...
...seven or eight fiber wafers,
and a large cup of black coffee.
Can I get you anything else?
- I thought I ordered the chicken.
- We're all out of the chicken.
I predict a bathroom break in five...
...four...
...three...
...two...
...one.
- He took the perfume.
- Relax.
- We'll think of something.
- Excuse me, is the bathroom occupied?
Ugh. The one in the back
is definitely occupied.
Oh, no, help yourself.
Bugs, that's the turtle.
The one that tried to smelt me.
We've gotta get that perfume
before he does.
Thank you.
I shouldn't,
but do you have any more peanuts?
Aah!
Oh, it's just so frustrating.
It's right there.
Ah, I've got it.
I'll take this fork and jab it into his
thigh, you take that scalding coffee...
...and just...
Just, pour it right in his face.
- What, you want to do the fork?
- Just sit down.
Excuse me sir, but we're about
to experience some turbulence ahead...
...so I'm gonna need to collect
any loose items you might have.
Okay, and what about your pockets?
- What?
- I'm gonna need you to empty your pockets.
So nothing jabs you,
with all the turbulence.
It's an FAA regulation.
You'll get it back.
Buckle up.
- You got it?
- I got it.
Ooh!
I also got a ton of duty-free stuff
from that turtle.
Oh, that's some really good bronzer.
MAN: Excuse me, ladies?
BOTH: Huh.
Shouldn't you two be awake?
Yeah,
but shouldn't you be flying the plane?
I don't want to alarm you,
we got word that Interpol...
...will meet us at the runway
when we land.
No one is to de-plane
until they come aboard.
Apparently we have two wanted fugitives
on our flight.
- Any questions?
- I have one.
Who do you think built Stonehenge?
I think aliens.
Heh, heh, heh.
We don't have any questions.
Hm.
We gotta hide. Follow me.
We'll stay down here
and sneak out with the bags.
You ain't gonna sneak nowhere.
You're gonna give me that thing everyone's
after you for that I don't know what it is.
You want this?
Well, guess what little man.
- You're gonna have to fight me for it.
- I ain't afraid to hit a girl.
Neither am I.
Oh!
Yee-ha!
SAM: Argh!
LOLA: Oh!
SAM:
Unh!
BUGS:
Oh!
Huh?
No!
No!
No!
Gotcha. Oh, that was close.
I thought I was in real trouble there
for a second.
Aah!
Grab onto me!
What are you doing?
Bugs, those are other people's things.
Maybe cab drivers
don't make a lot of money...
...doesn't mean you can steal
other people's clothes.
You don't even wear pants.
LOLA:
Oh.
Incredible.
Oh, come on.
I was just going on instinct.
- Anyone would've done the same thing.
- No, not you, this blouse.
So how do I look?
Excuse me, have you seen
those flight attendants?
- Keep it moving.
- But they have something of mine.
Well, that's the last of them.
No sign of the suspects.
That's impossible. Search it again.
I'm just saying it would've been nice if you
had parachuted us to a resort or a hotel.
- I mean, they're tons of them in France.
- Quiet.
- What?
- I don't think we're alone.
OMG.
- We're saved!
- We're surrounded by sharks!
Those are dolphins.
And fortunately for us, I speak dolphin.
I just told them to go get help,
get a nice yacht, a big one with a Jacuzzi.
- These are some dumb dolphins.
- You're crazy, you know that?
I should've never picked you up.
I was perfectly content
living my life on my own...
...and now I'm gonna get eaten by a fish
with a lunatic by my side!
Told you. Thanks dolphins.
Sorry for calling you dumb.
Oh, I mean:
Yes, this is Giovanni Jones.
I have an appointment
to see Mr. Moufette...
...but there's been a
slight complication...
...and I might need a little more time.
Hang up.
I believe you have something we want.
MAC:
How positively fortuitous.
Here you are trying to get to Paris...
And we're on our way to Paris.
Now enough chitchat.
I want to see that perfume
we've been hearing so much about.
Now don't judge it by the bottle,
it's all I had.
But I know that Mr. Moufette
will have a million wonderful ideas.
- I mean, I don't even have a name yet.
- What about Lola?
It has a certain ring to it.
Oh, no. Pfft.
I couldn't name it after myself.
Well, why ever not? You created it.
It's your fragrance.
Come on, give us a spritz.
My heavens!
TOSH: My heavens is right.
Oh, this scent is out of this world!
And so are you!
TOSH: What?
- You've disappeared!
That's why everyone wants this.
You invented invisibility!
Invisibility. Do you have any idea
what this means?
Yes. It means my perfume is a disaster.
What are you talking about?
A fragrance is supposed to make you
stand out, not disappear.
Forget the fragrance.
You invented the most powerful thing
maybe in the history of the world.
I am ever so sorry,
and I hate to be a bother...
...but there is still
that little matter of, ahem...
...my friend having vanished!
TOSH:
What on earth is everyone talking about?
Where are you, Tosh?
TOSH: I'm right here.
Where?
TOSH: Aah!
BUGS:
And now we know water washes it off.
- Whatever has gotten into you?
- You were invisible.
Oh, here we go again.
This is what our therapist
was talking about.
- I'm always invisible to you.
- I beg your pardon. No.
Remember Keith said,
"No one is always anything."
Oh, fine.
I am usually invisible to you.
Why? Because I ignored your advice
about my mother?
Cut the cord, Mac.
I told you I am going to stop
sending her money.
- You say that every month.
- I have to do it on my terms...
- ...and on my timetable.
- Cut the cord, Mac.
MAC: I am working with Keith on this.
TOSH: You lied to my face.
MAC: What are you talking about? TOSH:
You said you've not been in contact...
- ...and you've been in contact!
- How do you know that? Aah!
Have you looked at my phone?
Oh, don't you turn this around on me.
The woman said she hated me.
Hated!
Those are just words!
Words are weapons, Mac.
Cut the cord!
BUGS: What's up, doc?
- Hmm?
I told you, I'm not a doctor.
I don't know what I am anymore.
Well, you're about to become
the most famous person in the world.
Think of all the possibilities this offers.
Whenever you want,
you can go totally unnoticed.
It's the ultimate in being left alone.
Invisibility is a dream come true.
Maybe that's your dream.
It's not mine.
Maybe it's time you had a new dream.
Look at that.
The most romantic city in the world.
And thanks to your invention,
it can all be yours.
One night. What do you say?
I don't have anything to wear.
You do realize we'll be invisible?
Oh.
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
- Makeover!
- Makeover!
There's nothing quite as sweet
As a woman's inner beauty
A sparkle from within
Is a lady's call of duty
Your brains, your class, your winning smile
These things cannot be bought
But how to wear a killer dress
Can certainly be taught
- F
- Can you feel it?
- A
- All right, now
- B
- Bust it out
- U
- You know it
- L
- You love it
- O
- Oh, my
- U
- You following this?
- S
- I said
- We're so fabulous
- We're so fabulous
- We're so fabulous
- We're so fabulous
No time to waste
It's getting late
A flawless look from head to toe
To stand out from the rest
And, girl, you know there's no such thing
As over-accessorized
- Oh, boy.
- Can you feel it?
- A
- B
- Bust it out
- U
- You know it
- L
- You love it
- O
- Oh, my
- U
- You following this?
- S
- I said
- We're so fabulous
- We're so fabulous
- We're so fabulous
- We're so fabulous
And when in doubt, a kitten heel
Will always make you purr
A pouty lip, a contoured cheek
A smoky eye's a plus
Extend your lash, then arch your brow
And you'll look fabulous
- F
- Can you feel it?
- A
- All right, now
- B
- Bust it out
- U
- You know it
- L
- You love it
- O
- Oh, my
- U
- You following this?
- S
- I said
- We're so fabulous
- We're so fabulous
- We're so fabulous
- We're so fabulous
BUGS:
Girl, you're fabulous.
- Well, how do I look?
- Beautiful.
Seems a shame to do this, but...
- Have fun!
- Don't do anything we wouldn't do!
Well, that's not much now, is it?
TOSH:
Oh, you do need to cut that cord though.
MAC:
I know.
ALL:
Huh?
BUGS: You're the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.
LOLA:
What are you talking about? I'm invisible.
- You can't see me at all.
- I see you.
You two, freeze. It's over.
Now give me the bottle.
- Sorry.
- They had guns.
Why should you guys have it?
It's hers.
- She invented it.
- It's too powerful a weapon.
It can't end up in the wrong hands.
Now give us the bottle or we'll shoot.
I'm afraid the only shooting around here
is gonna be done by us.
Who are you?
Let's just say I'm working for someone
who wants that more than you.
You have two options.
Hand over the bottle, or I shoot you.
Or is that one option?
"Hand over the bottle or I shoot you."
Oh. I guess that's one option.
Looks like you only have one option.
Really?
What about this option?
CECIL: Oh!
ELMER: Don't do it.
LOLA:
No!
Huh?
SAM: Argh!
- Fifi!
I got it. I finally got that thing...
...that I don't know what it is
that everybody wants...
...that's worth more money
than I'd know what to do with.
Oh, boy.
If you want something done right,
you have to do it yourself.
I was just about to get that for you.
You're Martians too?
Oh, I bet you are getting paid
more than me.
You're a Martian?
MARVIN: Not just any Martian.
Marvin the Martian.
What do you want with invisibility?
MARVIN: It's quite simple really.
The Earth obstructs my view of Venus...
...so I'm going to make it invisible.
What?
But if everything was invisible...
...wouldn't there be confusion?
Cars would crash into each other,
planes would collide, people would die.
MARVIN: I know. It would be a lot easier
just to blow it up.
But I seem to have misplaced
the Illudium Q-36 Space Modulator...
...so plan B.
I didn't know you were going to make
the whole world invisible.
I mean, that's got to be as illegal a thing
to do as a person can think of.
I should be getting a ton more money.
What?
Oh, goody. It really does work.
But first I need to get rid
of that putrid scent.
Putrid? Putrid means bad, right?
MARVIN:
Now, where is that separator?
I always misplace the separator.
Aha.
Oh, goody.
Now I have one super-concentrated
bottle of invisibility.
And one bottle of...
Whatever you call this.
It's called Lola.
And that's the wrong one.
MARVIN: What are you talking about,
foolish Earth creature?
BUGS: This is the one you
want, it's the original.
MARVIN:
It is?
No harm done.
I'll take this one and give you this one.
- No, not that one.
- Here we go.
BUGS: No, that's okay, you keep this one,
I'll take that.
That's right. I'll take this one.
That's right.
You take that, I'll take this.
And there you are, sir.
And remember, the Acme Company
guarantees complete customer satisfaction.
MARVIN:
Well, thank you.
You don't see that type of personalized
service very often these days.
Hey. This isn't...
Get them!
MARVIN:
Aha.
MARVIN:
Stop right there, Earth creatures.
- Lock them in the Captivator.
- What?
MARVIN:
The Captivator.
The place where you hold someone captive.
It's...
Hmm, where is it?
I could've sworn it was right over there.
Forget it.
Everyone stand over there,
and if you move again I'll vaporize you.
CECIL: Huh?
MARVIN: You too.
What? I thought we had a deal.
Aw. I should have listened to my mother.
She always said never trust a Martian.
MARVIN:
I'll deal with you later.
And now it's time to say goodbye
to your precious Earth.
BUGS: Eh, hey, doc?
MARVIN: Mm-hm?
If you're not gonna do anything
with this perfume...
...mind if I give it to the girl?
Seeing as how
it was her life-long dream?
MARVIN: Do what you want. Because soon I
will be placing you all in the Eliminator...
...which is right over there.
Huh?
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.
How do you lose an Eliminator?
Oh, goody, it's ready.
What happened?
BUGS: Oh.
Were you wanting something to disappear?
Oh.
Shoot them.
Oh!
BUGS:
I'll take those.
CECIL:
This way.
MARVIN:
I am so angry.
LOLA:
You switched the bottles?
BUGS:
Ain't I a stinker?
Whoa, what's this?
"Illudium Q-36 Space Modulator."
CECIL:
Hurry.
BUGS:
Hey, Marvin.
Catch.
Oh.
Why, thank you.
I've been looking for that.
I hate Earthlings.
Fifi.
I was so worried about you.
Fifi, come back.
Fifi!
Where's the bottle?
In there.
Well, it's probably for the best.
I don't think the world
is quite ready for invisibility.
Well, it looks like you guys
got this under control...
...so I should probably be on my way.
Really?
You're a turtle.
I'm going to catch you.
CECIL:
Huh? Ah!
Oh, Lola, can you ever forgive me?
Of course I forgive you.
Oh, thank you.
- Hug?
- Don't push it.
Do you smell that?
I guess your dream came true.
You brought your fragrance
to the whole world.
- I'm sorry your dream didn't.
- What was my dream?
Getting to be all alone.
Maybe it's time I had a new dream.
SPEEDY:
Lola?
Speedy? What are you doing here?
I'm getting my morning croissant.
What are you doing here?
You don't pay rent, but you can take a
romantic trip to Paris with your boyfriend?
Ay-yay-yay.
I'm going to Switzerland
for some hot chocolate.
Ladies and gentlemen...
...it is my great privilege
to introduce to you...
...the head of the House of Moufette...
...Monsieur Le Pew.
Oh, my little bottle of love.
Oh.  my audience, she awaits.
Before I unveil our latest fragrance...
...I wish to say a few words.
One year ago, for a brief moment...
...the most unforgettable scent
covered the world...
...and I feared that we would never
smell something that beautiful again.
But I was wrong.
After all, this scent was created
by the same woman.
I give you...
...Lola.
What is the word, doctor?
Oh, what, I did it wrong? Sorry.
- How was your day?
- Busy, just the way I like it.
- How was yours?
- Not busy, just the way I like it.
So, what you wanna do tonight?
- I thought we could go to the game.
- It's the playoffs, it's sold out.
Eh, we'll get in. Trust me.
How?
Is that what I think it is?
You've had it this whole time?
- Have you been using it?
- No.
Well, maybe one time.
A couple of times.
Eh, I use it a lot.
DAFFY:
Hey, kid.
Go get me a corn dog, will you?
What's your name?
That's a stupid name.
That's all, folks.
Interesting.
