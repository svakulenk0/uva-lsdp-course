Father...
i swear on you, father. i did nothing.
it's true that i went to her house.
But i don't remember what happened there,
and i don't understand
what is wrong with me now?
Trust me, father.
i'm teiiing you the truth.
My son is a good boy.
He can't commit such crimes.
it seems he forgets what he's doing.
i don't understand whether he is
doing this intentionaiiy or not?
You must check him & teii me.
And one more important thing.
-Yes, teii me.
My son shouidn't know about this.
Not in this hospitai.
i wiii bring him to your nursing home.
Do it as if you are doing
a generai check up.
Because if he thinks that
i've iabeiied him as a iunatic,
he wiii feei very bad.
i had a patient today who came up
with a simiiar request.
He said that if my father knows
that i'm a iunatic, he wiii feei bad.
so, he didn't want me to reveai
this to his father.
And he has come for a check up.
Look there.
Aii the tests are over.
This is the finai test.
This couid be a spiit personaiity.
Or it couid be seiective amnesia aiso.
in such cases, one tends
to forget what they do.
And any treatment forthis?
Eiectro convuision therapy.
We caii it ECT.
That might be of heip.
You mean shock treatment.
- No doctor. No shock treatment.
He can't stand such treatment.
infact i can't bearthat.
it can aiso be cured with medicines.
But it can turn serious.
i'ii not iet that happen.
These things happen oniy when he goes out.
i wiii take good care of him at home.
Yes doctor. i wiii take care.
Come out. Come out my boy.
Listen to me.
No. Listen to me.
You don't know what you are doing.
Drop the knife.
Why are you behaving iike this?
Listen to me. Drop the knife.
How couid you kiii your own father?
Drop the knife.
What's wrong with you?
Drop the knife.
What's aii this Kodhandam?- Heip...
He is bieeding
What's the noise?- i'm bieeding.
Kodhandam, what's happened?
Who stabbed him?
Why is your son so angry at you?
My son...?
Yes sir.-Why?
He came to kiii you & not me.
i'm very scared.
Where is he?
He iocked himseif in the room.
Take him to a hospitai. Fast.
Lift him siowiy.
Hey...what happened?
Open the door.- Caii the asyium.
i don't need any shock treatment.
i'm very scared, father.
i may die, father. Piease father.

No...i iet him go.
Because i shouidn't get caught.

happen to my mother?
i iet him go.
i want to kiii him & frame his son for

That's why i made his son a iunatic.

Beiieve me, you oid man!
Good.o to the asyium & see foryourseif.

his son a iunatic?
Even before i couid take revenge on him,
Good.od has punished the man
