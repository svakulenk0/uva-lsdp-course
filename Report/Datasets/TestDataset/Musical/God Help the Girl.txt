You could argue even, you know,
Nick Drake's mystique is a lot
to do with him not being around,
d'ya know what I mean?
If Nick Drake was now
on  with Alan Carr,
talking about his new record,
that mystique would
be dissipated, wouldn't it?
No, you're absolutely right,
yeah, yeah, yeah.
Age shall not wither him,
you know what I mean?
-He's frozen at that moment.
-Ian Curtis.
And it's a slender body of work,
Ian Curtis has got two albums.
And of course, people who never
knew the band at the time,
guys our age, "Blimey did you
ever see Joy Division?"
I said, "Yeah, about 30 times,
they were always around,
I was bored with them," but the
mystique builds inextricably.
Starting to think that
both of us still being here
is rather a kind of tired,
bourgeois thing to do.
-What are you saying?
-I'm not saying anything, mate.
Anyway, this is Findley
and Donovan
and coming up later,
Wobbly Legged Rat, who,
if you've been a regular
listener to this show,
you'll know we're very keen on.
Looking forward very much
to seeing them
tomorrow,
live in Glasgow.
And later on in this show,
we have Gabriel and Damascus.
I'm bored out my mind
Too sick to even care
I'll take a little walk
Nobody's going to know
I'm in senior ward
It gives you
a little free time
I'll just use it all at once
Took the fence and the lane
The bus then the train
Bought an  to make
me look like I got brains
I made a story up in my head
if anybody would ask
I'm going to a seminar
I'm a genius
I'm a prodigy
A demon at maths and science
I'm up for a prize
If you gotta
grow up sometime
You have to do it
on your own
I don't think I could stand
to be stuck
That's the way that things
were going
The Bible's my tool
There's no mention of school
My Damascan Road's
a transistor radio
I tune in at night when my mum
and my dad start to fight
I put on my headphones
And I tune out
I am devout
The girls'll sing about
my life
But they're not here,
they've got the wild life
If you want to find out,
find out
You have to look them
in the eye
That's why my only choice
Is find the face
behind the voice
I know what they're after
This life is kind of boring
Kids don't want you
He's gotta play
the record, hey
The kids are gonna want you
Thank you, thank you, people.
We are Wobbly Legged Rat.
This song is for you.
Oh yeah
Hello, we are King James
the Sixth from Scotland.
Yeah, we're just--we're kind of
trying that name out,
so if you get any ideas,
just shout them out.
All right!
Come on, get started!
Right, just--
We want Anton!
I want Anton!
One fine day,
I'm gonna leave this town
I'm gonna run with the deer
I'm gonna swim
like a swimming thing
I've had it with this,
girl, I've had it with you
At least look at me when
I say that we're through
And I'm done
This is actually--
it's quite a good song
if we could play it.
All I can hear
is the bloody drums.
Ow.
Fight, fight, fight!
Fight! Fight! Fight!
You're a bloody
tea drinker, pal.
You shouldn't be in a band!
Are you okay?
You're the guy
from the fight.
My guitar got it worse.
You don't look so good.
Morning.
I was just gonna come
and check your pulse,
see if you were still alive.
Who are you again?
Oh, James, the guitar player.
So, do you have a job or do you
just make money playing guitar?
No, I work at the university
swimming pool.
-I'm a lifeguard.
-Lifeguard.
I see, you're always
saving people.
Grab the ring and just calmly
swim back.
Here is the safeness.
Yeah, when I get the chance.
This is my stop coming up.
So, thank you, lifeguard.
I know where to find you.
Eve?
Eve, come back here!
Eve, wait, hey, wait.
Come, come, come here.
Let's get her in
to one of the single rooms.
I'm fine where I was.
Well, you should've thought
about that before.
So, we've had the police
looking for you.
You've wasted our time
and the police's time.
You've put yourself
right back where you started.
So, you're gonna stay
in the single room
that we've got for you.
You'll have no visitors.
We're gonna take your phone
and your books
and you'll have a nurse
watching you at all times.
Morning, Eve.
Come on.
Thank you.
Step on for me.
Okay.
Okay, this is your life.
People need to start
at the bottom
and work their way up, okay?
So, if you don't have
the basic things, like food,
water, sleep,
you can't go anywhere.
Only when you have those,
you can proceed up
to the next level
where you have a home,
family, friends,
have money to get by.
You have well-being,
relationships, sex.
And then you could move up
to this top layer,
where you have art,
morality, music.
And these things can catch you
if you fall,
but if you try going
for this top layer first
and there's no support,
then the whole pyramid
just crashes down.
So, it's as simple as that,
is it?
Yup, it is.
Don't worry about it.
Your stomach shrunk,
it's not used to a full meal.
I've been crying all day.
It's pathetic.
It's maybe not
such a bad thing.
It's progress.
Two weeks back, you wouldn't
have been able to,
but now that you're
eating again,
your body is waking up.
You're feeling things again.
That's good.
And what if everything
I'm feeling is shit?
That's the hard part.
Do you ever think about
writing your feelings down?
So, how are you liking it here?
It's fine.
It's not like I have anything
else important to do
at the moment.
But you will one day.
All right, that's you're done.
Pretty when the wind blows
I love my tree in autumn
Like I love my tree
in summer
Like I love my tree
in winter
They locked me in a room
And I thought of you
in autumn
And I'm sad I won't
see you again
Pretty when you sing me
a new song in autumn
And a new song in winter
And a new song in summer
Pretty when you put down
your bow and come over
With the smell
of your breath that I love
With the look in your eye
That I love
Eve, can you tell me
when the last time was
that you felt good?
I don't know, really,
I mean,
I guess everything sort of
started going downhill
after I moved away
from home, you know?
What did you love
when you were young?
Um...
I loved reading, I kind of loved
being by myself, I suppose.
Um...
Watching movies, dressing up.
I know I have to eat,
I know how to eat.
I know I wasn't
looking after myself,
but I'll do okay.
Why don't you try
for a music school?
I could help you
with the applications.
Well, I might do one day,
but right now,
I just wanna get back to life.
But your life before
you first came in here
was a disaster, so it has to be
a different life.
And I've got a plan
that involves
a gradual reintroduction
to your life,
combined with a step by step
reduction in your pills.
And how long's that gonna take?
Enjoying our time in Glasgow,
very much so.
They "Kissing in the
Red Zone" hit makers,
we can now say Wobbly Legged
Rats are gonna be coming in
and doing a live session
later in the week,
which people are looking
forward to enormously.
Come on, fire up.
We look frightened, we don't
need to be frightened of them
because we're all fucking
mental, do you understand?
They're not mental,
they don't have a clue, right?
These are children--
they're beautiful children,
but they're children,
and we can take them down,
do you understand?
Go mental!
Come on, ref.
Oh, right in the fanny.
You all right?
I'm gonna go and get changed.
Eve?
Eve?
No, you're absolutely right,
yeah, yeah, yeah.
I mean, do you think
that, like--I mean the Stones
are still around, of course,
but, I mean,
they do have a dead member.
I mean, obviously,
there is a mystique 'cause they
did lose one along the way.
It's almost like
with Led Zep, isn't it?
It's almost like unless
you've lost one,
you don't really kind of--
You're not really the upper
echelons of rock 'n' roll.
-The water looks really good.
-Jesus!
You scared the shit out of me.
Eve.
At your service.
I told you I'd find you.
Wow, you look well.
I like your knees.
So, a swim, possibly?
Oh, yeah, sure, okay.
A quick one though, I have
to keep the main light off.
Do you have a costume
I could borrow?
Yeah, there's some
in the office.
I'll just--
So, what are you doing here?
I was just playing football
against the uni.
How's it goin' anyway?
Really good, actually.
Been making music,
writing songs and stuff.
That's a big bag.
Yeah, I'm kind of
in between places.
Ah, well, you know,
there is a room in my flat--
sort of a room,
a bit of a room that's free.
-A bit of a room?
-Yeah.
I mean, well,
it's a separate room,
it's just a bit enclosed.
Well, I'm okay
with enclosed spaces.
Cool, well, I mean, if you want,
I can ask the guy.
Okay.
Okay, okay, good.
I love my room,
I'm getting used to sleeping
Some nights,
I really like to lie awake
I hear the midnight birds
A message in their words
The dawn will touch me
In a way a boy
could never touch
Their promise never meant
so much to me
Makes him sound like
early Joseph Cale.
Sounds like the Pastels
and everything.
I mean, that is absolutely
definitive indie,
isn't it, really, I mean
the look with the sort of,
you know, an anorak and hair
that looks slightly
like it's been dipped
in chip fat, you know?
I used to try and dress
like Roddy Frame in 1981.
You didn't get a girlfriend
till you were 30, did you?
Excuse me, hi.
Are you guys doing
a live session tonight?
-Yeah.
-What's your band called?
Wobbly Legged Rats.
Oh, yeah, I've heard of you.
If I give you something,
could you give it
to Findley or Donovan?
-Sure.
-This is really important.
They're expecting this tape.
I'll give it to them
the second I see them.
Okay.
Did we meet before?
Nope, never.
I would have remembered.
I am Anton.
We play at the Berlin Club
in a few days
and I can add you to the list
if you'd like.
Okay, sure,
I'll try and make it.
All right.
Just please give them
the tape, okay?
Remember to give them
the tape.
-Yes.
-Thank you.
Nice to meet you.
She is unbelievable.
Yup, but it's not like
she's gonna look at us
with all the Swiss Germans here.
No, there's no way she's getting
past the big Swiss German.
Life is tragic.
But good.
Eve.
I've been out
of the city for a while.
Maybe you can tell me
if I start acting conspicuous.
I like conspicuous.
Probably take the freakiest
thing about you and blow it up.
-Are your hands cold?
-No.
I bet if I touched your hands
they'd be freezing cold.
My hands are fine.
Cold, knew it.
I couldn't stand that, I mean,
I'd get sick instantly.
I've got the constitution
of an abandoned rabbit.
When did you learn to play?
I've always played.
Show me something.
Grow up, you're nearly 25
What happened when
you were a child
Do you require an analyst
Or will a friendly
smile suffice
Find your space,
are you breathing well?
Do you feel okay?
Are you calm?
Are you comfortable?
Is your heartbeat racing?
Is this your soul
you're facing?
Lay down, my couch
is over there
I think you'll find
it's way more comfortable
Take off your glasses,
don't be scared
For 30 pounds, I'll listen
to your stories dear
Shut the window there
We should keep
this session intimate
Don't you agree
I have experience
in matters similar
I can't juggle,
I can't knit a pinafore
But I'll listen to your tale
and give you some advice
I was an ace
when I was young
I learned to dance,
I didn't have to learn
I was a case when I grew up
A case of hope
crashing to the ground
I learned, I hit the skids
And I woke up, me, myself
and I was a different person
If I take you on,
will you be pliable
As a confidante,
I'm quite reliable
Dreamer, though you are
It is you that's been
my signpost
So far
Do you often sing to people?
No, never, really.
Just you, just now.
-You're very good at it.
-Thank you.
I've been teaching this girl
to play guitar.
Mm-hm.
You should come with me
some time.
And what do you want
me to do?
Maybe we could work
on one of your songs?
Or you could help
her write something.
I mean, she wants to write,
but she doesn't quite have
your way.
You may have to pretend
to be my assistant.
-Carry your pencils and stuff?
-Exactly.
Some thought should be put in
to the matter of what to wear.
Hi, James.
Cassie, this is Eve.
Do you mind us
hijacking your lesson?
It depends, are you going
to make me play scales?
o.
-Then I don't mind.
So, what would you rather do?
Well, when I started this,
I was hoping
we were going to write songs.
It does help to know
your instrument first.
I think sometimes
you just need to know the chord
you're looking for.
Yeah, but how do you find it?
Well, maybe we should just
try and write a song right now.
-Okay.
-Well...
a good song isn't written
by committee, I don't know if--
Cassie, what have
you done today?
Just tell me the first thing
you did
when you got out
of bed this morning.
Well, I meant to get up
really early,
but I was still the last nap
and I had to fill the dishwasher
'cause I was last downstairs,
which was a rip-off
'cause I didn't get
anything to eat.
And then what happened?
I jumped in the shower,
got dressed.
Captain was crying
so I had to take her out.
She's my dog.
We went to the park,
climbed the fence
for a shortcut.
Anything happen in the park?
Captain was acting strange,
she kept running ahead
and then got into
the herb garden
and then she started
digging like mad.
I got out of bed
and came here for adventure
I stepped on a stone
on the way
I took off my shoe
and a dog came towards me
Wagging his tail happily
Dog, if you could speak,
you'd know what to do
Simply turn around and run
Rent a cheap second
and crystal ball
I would trust my future
to you
Got out of bed when
the springs wouldn't have me
Fired me up, like a gun
Fell into my suit
and I walked down to breakfast
Green leaves
and blue sky and sun
Boy, if you could speak,
you'd know what to do
You'd sit and let the world
go 'round
Remember all you saw
and tell it back
in the stories when
the day is done
Remember all you saw
and tell it back
in the stories when
the day is done
My Theory for Applied Music
rocked.
We were doing Romeo and Juliet
for English,
but I got more into the song,
"Romeo and Juliet."
It's a good song.
The guy who wrote that song
is a songwriting deity.
Did he write any other
tunes as good?
One, one and a half.
So, then how can you proclaim
him a deus?
A man needs only write
one genius song,
one song that lives forever
in the hearts of the populous
to make him forever divine.
Well, it should be
easy then.
It's not easy.
Many women and men have lived
empty, wasted lives in attics
trying to write
classic pop songs.
What they don't realize is
it's not for them to decide.
It's God.
Or, the god of music.
Or, the part of God that
concerns Himself with music.
That's why the hit maker
has to be considered part divine
because the divine
spoke through them.
Preposterous notion.
But quite a good one.
Excuse me for one minute.
-So, you came.
-Yeah, I just made it.
Sorry I missed your band.
Have you been working
in a factory or what?
No, I've been waitressing.
What are you doing?
I have an idea.
Come, come.
What is this place?
This is where I work sometimes.
Wow, do you own this place?
No, I don't own it, but I know
where all the good stuff is.
I could help you pick
something to wear.
-Really?
-Sure, have a look around.
They never met
The singer and the swinger
She walked in
They walked around
each other
Fighting for the mirror
and smiling
Nope, that is not for you.
This is for another species.
I was tongue tied
You could try it, I suppose.
And she aspired to perfection
as a hipster
No, that is not suitable
to your shape.
Your breasts
are exquisite.
The dress looks
like a potato sack.
You're not a potato.
Okay, well,
walk forward.
Now on your left.
Forward, good.
Right.
I wouldn't waste time
Warm.
Warmer.
Every second day
just dreaming
Bingo.
Try this one.
My dream
was realized
but I was
sleeping
Hey, did you give
my tape to those guys?
Yes, they said they
would put it on the pile.
Is that all they said?
Well, they said
that it was unusual
to get a tape these days.
Ta da.
She passed
out cold
Are you okay?
Just lie still
You'll feel better
What happened,
I wanna go home
Where am I
What have I
done wrong
You say that
but how do you know
Who are you?
What do you want?
I always wondered
how things could be
I wouldn't waste time
dreaming about me
Spend every second day
just dreaming
how the first one
ought to be
My dream
was realized
but I was
sleeping
I was
sleeping
James.
James.
What is it?
What's wrong?
Really bad dream.
Can I just stay up here
for like two minutes?
Yeah, yeah.
What?
There's water
running under the door.
Okay, I've got it.
You okay?
I'm fine.
Um, I was going
to go out for a wander
if you want to come.
No, I'm just
gonna to stay here.
Okay.
Pretty Eve
in the tub
Please allow
me to scrub
Please allow
me to rub
Tell me
cares of the day
Let me
wash them away
All the
hideous weight
Dry you
gently
Dress you
tenderly
And ready
for bed
You're asleep
still standing up
I like you
not made up
You've got
a nice face
It is crumpled
and creased
from the way
that you sleep
But I like you
the best
in one
of my vests
that you
casually keep
Steal from me
my underwear
You wear it
better than me
Go all day,
no false alarms
You charm
them all
The worker,
labor free shirker
Management
lady
Government
spy
Long legged girl
from the west
You came
onto the scene
like an
energetic beam
Charming ways
you have learnt
All the boys
have been bent
by your
mesmerizing gaze
Waltzing into
situations
Very kind,
getting a raise
Writing home
to tell your folks
about the
city ways
Are nagging
at you
What's a girl
supposed to do
When a city
closes in
Noise from
the lady upstairs
She's as deaf
as a post
As transparent
as a ray
Boys are
queuing
Trouble's
brewing
But you take
it all in
But you take
it all in
Ride the wave
of their affection
Look behind
their gaze
and confessions
of lust
Pretty Eve
in the tub
Please allow
me to scrub
Please allow
me to rub
Please allow
me to scrub
Why did you want
to meet here?
I have lungs,
asthma.
When I'm waiting
for someone
I like to be
in tropical Southeast Asia.
What's up with you?
Argh, bloody Findley
and bloody Donovan
The radio guys?
-Mm-hm.
-Ah.
You expected
they would.
Yeah, I hoped
that they would.
You know, those guys are
not going to go for someone
playing and singing
acoustic on an old tape.
You've got to make it
easier for them.
They're not going
to take a chance
on some nutcase.
Ow.
You know, you need
to write for something,
you need
to have a reason.
Right, be yourself.
Write about yourself.
Whatever it is
that's happened to you.
I thought you said we were going
to have some fun tonight.
Ah, we are just
getting to it.
Jesus, can you even see?
Wait, just put--
okay, put them on,
thanks.
Thank you.
I want to be
a councilor.
Like a marriage counselor?
No, on the City Council.
How do you get that?
People have
to vote for you.
Oh, no one's going
to vote for you, James.
You're too feminine.
I used to meet my friend Carol
before school,
go to meet my boyfriend.
What age?
Thirteen.
Quite advanced for 13.
Good way to start
the day, though.
Quick snog
down at the statues.
I like this
time of night.
Feels like the morning.
I don't know why the birds
are going so crazy,
they're meant to be in bed,
or at least thinking
about sleep.
They might get randy
at this time of year.
Maybe they're
having a bird disco.
Oh, no way,
I know discos
are frowned upon
in bird society.
Oh really?
How do you know that?
I was a young
ornithologist.
Cass!
Cassie!
Cassie!
What are you doing?
We're going
on a day trip,
do you want to come?
Go get dressed.
Okay.
Cassie, just come
out the front door.
Oh, okay.
What is this place?
It belongs
to the university.
You're serious?
We're going in that?
How does it go?
You have to paddle.
Where are we going?
That way.
But what's that way?
Are we going
through the country
or through the city?
Are we canoeing
through traffic?
Well, you can either
go to Edinburgh
or you can
go to the sea.
There's a fork up ahead.
Anyway, it's kayaking,
it's not canoeing.
We call this canoeing
where I grew up.
Yes, well, we're
in Scotland now.
Eve, why would you
want to come here
when it's sunny
in Australia?
Well, because when
I finished high school
I met this boy
who was in a band
and I...
What?
She's a groupie.
Don't listen to James.
Was he good looking?
Was he really good looking?
He was quite
good looking.
Was he Australian?
He was Australian,
but he moved over here
with his band.
I guess I followed him,
I don't know.
Well, why were you
not in the band?
Well, I wasn't really
playing music then.
So you crossed multiple
continents for a boy.
This is weird.
You want to go back?
No, it's good weird.
I feel like
I'm escaping.
I feel like Tom Sawyer.
We should definitely
fake our own deaths.
Oh, excuse me,
blondie, I know you.
You go to the posh school?
Would you
go with my pal?
Where does he
want me to go?
I don't understand
what you're saying.
Would you go with him,
as in go with him?
Uh...James, paddle.
Oh, I love her,
she's an English rose.
But I bet she's 30.
To deny the ned
would be to deny
the whole point
of this town.
What was that?
I'm just saying,
this is a ned city now.
It's a Victorian
theme park,
but it's run by neds.
What happened
to the Victorians?
They built the city,
they used
the workforce,
then they fucked off
with the money.
I know more about the city
than I would say
of the local residents.
-What?
-I do.
I study the history
of this place, I've--
I have.
Sorry, James,
you are English.
No, I'm not.
How long after you
were born in Scotland
did you live
in Scotland?
All right, well,
I was born here
and then after like
six months we moved.
Oh, that doesn't count.
If you went
to the pub now,
around the corner,
and you were like,
"Hi, everyone,
I'm Scottish,"
someone would punch
you in the face.
Absolutely.
No they wouldn't.
Maybe I'd
punch them back.
We're definitely
a band now.
Why are we
a band now?
This is something
only a band would do.
This is band shit.
Day trips,
canoeing, kayaking.
What do you think, James?
I think we are
three people paddling a boat,
that's all.
So what makes
a band then?
You don't make a band,
a band makes you.
It comes up
and sweeps you along.
Do you know what, I think
it's possible that all
the truly great records
have been made anyway.
I mean,
what's the point?
Pop music's basically--
it's been on the slide
since 1969.
Do you have any idea
what he's talking about?
Not really, but he
sounds quite sad.
I'm going
to be in Eve's band,
and you can either
be in it or go back
to posting up sad notices
in sad cafés.
Thank you.
There you are.
So is this a regular thing
with you, James,
just taking girls
on random day trips?
Up until this point
I would have said no.
I don't believe you.
I think it's the one sneaky
little move you have.
It's a good one.
Thank you for helping.
And, thank you as well.
What did I do?
I don't know.
Okay.
Steady.
Steady there, me hearties.
You can keep shouting,
because as captain
of this vessel
I'm going to have
to knock you out.
James, just chill out.
I drank too much wine.
We know you did.
You still feel
like Tom Sawyer?
A bit.
Like Tom Sawyer
when he's drunk.
Hi, this is Dr. Callie Gretty
here,
please leave a message
after the tone and--
Okay, so what do you want
this band to sound like?
Well, I don't know.
I mean, do you really
have to think about it?
Doesn't it just happen?
Mostly it does, depends
on what kind of color
you want to add
to the songs.
Do you want it
to just be us three?
Yes, I--I don't
think I could handle
any more people
right now.
So you don't
want any drums?
Or a bass?
Well, wouldn't those things
just get in the way?
I mean, wouldn't
they choke the sounds?
Isn't that exactly what
happened with your band?
Yeah, but those
guys were idiots.
They--they didn't know
what they were doing.
Let me just
ask you this.
The--the records
that you love,
would you say
they were folk music,
classical, jazz,
or pop?
Pop music.
Then we're gonna
need drums and a bass.
Ugh, but I don't want
any other people in the band.
I think we can
make a nice sound.
Ohh, we--we can
make a nice sound,
yeah, there's
no doubt about that.
But let me
tell you this,
if you want to hear
your voice floating
in the middle of a beautiful
tapestry of frequencies,
you're gonna
need a pop group.
Oh, okay, I just
thought about something.
We get people to play drums
or bass or whatever we need,
but we tell them right from
the start that we're the band.
They do what they're told
or they can leave.
But I mean, do you think people
would actually go for that?
It's not like we're
experts or anything.
That doesn't matter, no one
knows anything except you.
You're the song writer,
you're the boss.
So what do we do?
Advertise.
James can make one
of his super cool flyers
and I won't steal it
like I did last time.
Can you do it, big man?
Come on, let's go,
it's pissing rain.
He's a loving
kind of guy
He's dedicated
to his mate
His choice,
he is in love
But temptation
always pulls
the other way
As he waits,
his dream fresh
inside his head
His baby is
sleeping below
He's a loving
kind of guy
He goes to church
every day
He's trying
to forget
Every day
he chips away
a little rock
on his shoulder
Love is
a sculptor
and he makes him
a shoulder again
I've got to go to work.
Will you come find me
and tell me what happens?
Okay, okay,
you've got me.
Just sit, sit down.
What are you
doing here?
We're not
doing anything.
But you've
left a trail there.
Okay, listen, shush.
Shh!
shut up.
Listen to the guy,
he's got something to say.
If you want
to be in the band,
got to listen
to the guy, okay?
The handsome guy, hm?
Okay, this is what
we're looking for.
There's this place
at the university
where this other
band rehearses
and we can
borrow their stuff.
Apparently there's
twins in the band,
and they're both hot.
Are you all right?
Yes, I'm fine.
Shit, so we're
really gonna do this?
Eve, your brother's here.
You don't
have a brother.
Hi.
One second.
What's the deal
with the Swiss chap?
The man mountain,
the yodeling flingy.
The fuckish dilettante.
What's a dilettante?
I don't know,
one who dabbles?
Has he dabbled?
Oh, he's tried.
You let him?
I was preparing
to let myself.
Then he got
kind of hypnotized.
My cleavage cast
a spell over him.
Really?
Is that usual?
No, absolutely not.
I go up and down
quite a bit.
Sometimes I quite like them,
feel ready to show the world,
and other times I just
want to tape them up
and go running
through the barley.
How did you
get in here?
We said we had
your inhaler.
Can we get
your room keys?
What are you
gonna do in there?
We're gonna use your
guitar and your keyboard
and write a new song.
Okay, but don't
go through my stuff.
No way, brother.
We might even
cook you dinner.
What's the song like?
A little bit Osmonds,
little bit Bowie.
Oh, oye, no.
Hey, I love him.
I'm going through
a real phase with him.
Yeah, of course you are,
every young girl your age
goes through a phase with him,
which is fine,
it's commendable.
What are you talking about?
I've never shed a tear
to a Bowie record.
Uh, I'm sure he's really
going to be upset about that.
Yeah, well, it's important.
Music's meant
to move you or whether--
Okay, and then, James,
can you bring the guitars in?
One, two, three, four.
Come Monday night
the day of work is done
Tuesday
morning looms
The grey
of ordinariness
Start by putting
off your chores
and all the
crushing bores
Say your
morning prayers
Sing a
rousing song
Then sing it
on the long walk home
Come Monday night
we're in a state of grace
Twenty million
boys are caught up
in a paper chase
If the weekend
promised much
then it failed
to touch
on a single count
what I was hoping for
What I was
hoping for
Come Monday night
we turn the telly off
To listen
to the silence
Light that comes
in from outside
If you could
catch it all
and pin it
to your wall
Then you will
sleep much better
Baby, you would
sleep much better
Maybe you would
sleep much better
Baby, you would
sleep much better
Maybe you would
sleep much better
Baby, you would
sleep much better
Maybe you would
sleep much better
Baby, you would
sleep much better
Maybe you would
sleep much better
So, is the band
going to have a name?
Oh, no, not
a name conversation.
Why not
a name conversation?
Don't you think it's stupid
just to give yourself a name
just because
you sing songs?
What, so the Beatles
were stupid?
Well, they were
kind of stupid
if they actually
stopped to think about it.
You definitely
think too much.
You think the fun
out of things.
I mean,
I--I'm a lifeguard,
I work at a pool
with three other guys.
We didn't give
ourselves a name.
What, like the Lifeboys
or something?
That's pretty good.
Look, I just don't want
to have a name conversation.
It's a Saturday,
right now all over this town
hundreds of bands just like us
are having name conversations.
Thousands of punks,
Goths, psychobillies,
indie kids, rockers,
and just general knobheads
are just sitting there arguing
about what to call themselves.
I think you
just hate people.
I don't mind people.
I just can't stand
collective idiocy.
Maybe we should
have a name
that means something
really dirty
but nobody knows
what it means,
like Pearl Jam
or something.
What--what does
Pearl Jam mean?
Well, it's like,
you know, it's like spunk.
-What?
-Like jizz.
after a man's excretion.
-Ew.
-What, how is that?
Because that's
like the average amount
that a man ejaculates,
ten ccs, yeah.
Who measures that?
I don't know,
scientists.
-Scientists?
-Sperm scientists.
Ew.
...a self-absorbed prat.
I suppose with...
We're going out.
Who's going out?
Me and you.
o.
-Yes, we are.
Come on.
What's happening in here?
Uh, in the Halls,
I don't know.
We should look in.
Baby, it's time
to get out
Twenty years
incarceration
Twenty minutes
of elucidation
Hey, that's the guys.
You know, the guys
are playing on stage.
I've got
an idea
It's gonna take
more than a year
Come on,
let's dance.
Baby's just waiting
for the phone to ring
Did you know that
they played in here?
Just hopin'
for some love
-Yup.
-Sneak.
Please look
around you
We should tell
Cassie about this.
We should tell
Cassie about him.
You dress
like the '50s
You watch
You fail in
every category
of what a modern
man should be
Is that Captain there?
Yeah, that's her, Jim.
Can I borrow her?
Yes, she's been here
for too long anyway.
Captain.
Go get Cassie.
Ladies and gents,
may I introduce Eve Carmichael.
Just another
Saturday
The boys are
dressed up fine
Think I'll wait
till half past eight
to dress
myself divine
Ten-thirty
I'm in rags
A slutty look
accompanies my
questionable gaze
Through
the strobe light
and the haze
Hey, Captain.
Take an interest
in me
Why must I
beg for a drink
Too verbose,
you come too close, sir
Please step
back and think
That's
the trouble
flesh attracts
the leery look
Rarely does
the dream boy come along
He don't exist
A lover with
the candor of a friend
I run away
They're playing
a decent song at last
I think I'll have
to dance with Cassie
'cause the dream boy
never asked
Shuffle
to the left
I kick
the boy behind
to make
a little room
Boogie
to the right
Cassie
dances madly
like a boxing
kangaroo
Her little joey
buys the drinks
He's in love
more than he thinks
They know
the dance too well
The bodies
heavenly
Move around
the autumn sky
with measured
dignity
But my Venus
and my Mars
are set
to clash
The lover will
lay down his sword
and swear
He don't
exist
A brother to me
when the chips were down
I run away
They're playing
a decent song at last
I think I'll have
to dance with Cassie
'cause the dream boy
never asked
Shuffle
to the left
I kick
the boy behind
to make
a little room
Boogie
to the right
Cassie
dances madly
like a boxing
kangaroo
Spinning
on the spot
Hell do I care
what I look like
when I feel
this good
I'll keep
on dancing
Ahh ahh ahh
I'll keep
on dancing
Ahh ahh ahh
I'll keep
on dancing
Ahh ahh ahh
What do you make
of Cassie's little man?
Quite a pretty specimen.
She's gonna
eat him up.
Is it true, they're gonna
let us play in a few weeks?
Yes, it's true.
We could do with
a few more songs, though.
Man, we're gonna
have our own show.
But you know I'm going
on holiday tomorrow, right?
What?
Since when? You never said
anything about a holiday.
I know, I buried it
'cause I was dreading it,
but there's no escape.
A week in Bordeaux
with the family,
it's gruesome.
-Hello.
-Hi.
This is James
and Cassie.
This is Anton.
May I talk
to you for a minute?
Sure.
Bye guys.
Who the fuck is he?
I'm just thinking
about my tape
that you gave
to the radio station.
Mm-hm, what of it?
I just think I
should do it again.
It was too...
I don't know, it feels
like a long time ago.
I think I could do it
much better now.
No, it's okay.
How are you to know?
It sounded very naive.
You listened to it?
Well, yes, briefly.
Wow, you must
have listened to it
straight after
I gave it to you.
Pretty soon, yeah.
You had a tape player
in the van?
One of the guys had
a radio cassette, yeah.
So you all heard it.
Those that
were listening.
And this is before
you gave it to Findley?
I didn't give him the tape.
What, why?
Well, for a start it
was a little embarrassing.
What do you mean?
Nobody hands
in cassettes,
especially not
to a radio station.
That's not the point.
It was from me for him
and he would have gotten it.
I don't think so,
and you could do better.
You said so yourself.
Fuck!
It was hard
to listen to.
You need someone else
to play guitar, not you.
You need to record
with proper equipment.
You know, your words are
depressing and self-centered.
Your songs
are--are baby songs,
they are songs
for children.
You're going to have to learn
to take criticism, you know.
Fuck you!
Where are you going?
Church.
Why?
It's 'cause of the dream
I just had.
What was the dream?
There's nothing more boring
than other people's dreams.
No, I want to hear it.
I dreamt I was dead
and I could look back
on everything I'd done.
Was I in it?
I don't think so.
It was like I'd been
sent back to pick through
all the details of my past
with a massive magnifying glass.
So what do you
think it means?
Every moment we have is
actually much
more important
than we take it for.
So you're
going to church.
Just thought I'd go and see
if I could get the feeling back.
So can I come with you?
I'm just going
to wander down by myself.
I'll see you
back here later.
James.
James!
This is Cassie De la Roxfurd.
At the tone leave your name
and message, I'll get back--
James!
I'm all alone
This is a holiday
Some bloody holiday
My friends
have gone away
They're of the temporary sort,
I think
I will be
better without
As long as you
let me out
To taste the air
beside the river
I pick the soundtrack
With immaculate care
Such a lot rests upon it
My life upon a song
You don't know
how much I need
Musician,
please take heed
I thought I might just
write a letter
Anything to stay away
From books
and lessons today
Besides, it's part
of my induction
Into the literate world
I am a literate girl
I lean my love
upon you with each line
A gift of improvising
removes me from revising
I'll kick this mood off
with a change of scene
I bought a leotard
and go to the gym
I couldn't get away with
wearing it last summer
But I lost
a lot of weight
I think it's down to leaving
meat out of my diet
As a rule, I won't buy it
'cause it's cool
And if the nighttime
threatens me with pain
I will give in
to the lust
I will do
what I must
I've got a number
of a girl I know
Who gets her hallucinogens
from a pair of hooligans
I'll take a dose,
I don't mind trying
She lets me stay there
while I leave the ground
Old episodes of
Minder,
I snuggle right beside her
Think that I'll stay
till morning
She's got me
started yawning
I want a story
with a happy ending.
So you are James, please.
How long have
you known Eve?
Um, just since
the start of the summer.
Ah, and you are
the boyfriend?
No, uh, I'm the friend.
Ah.
How's she doing?
She's okay, now.
Did you know that Eve
was in here before?
Yeah.
She left too soon.
I advised her she wasn't ready,
but she didn't listen.
Did she ever talk
about her illness?
But you figured it out?
If you listen
to the songs.
The songs.
How did you know
where I was?
Uh, it was me
that brought you in.
Eve Alexander Carmichael.
What the hell
happened to you?
What do you mean?
All that day.
Where were you? You said
you were coming home.
Well, I don't--I don't
tell you everything.
I mean, it's not like
you tell me anything.
Okay, I should leave you
to get some rest.
No-no-no-no,
don't go, please.
I've had enough rest.
Are you gonna be okay?
Like, I mean, do you
want me to do anything?
Just come and see me,
okay?
And maybe bring Cass sometimes
if she can bear it.
You've had a setback,
a predictable one.
I mean, you must've had
some good times this summer.
Yeah.
What about finishing
your college application?
I think you're ready.
My room faces north
But the sun's
in the south
I'm just waking up
to the news of my birth
I am a girl,
and I'm lucky to be here
Whatever that's worth
Like an ostrich, I lived
with my head in the sand
I slipped into corners,
I sat on my hands
I learned to stifle
the shouts and the outrage
I'm feeling
deep down
With my chains falling off
and the hope in a friend
Cafes and walkways
and sculptured weekends
I am getting to love
my freedom
I am getting to like
my surroundings
My room faces north
But the sun's
in the south
You are far out of reach
Could I be any worth
to some special person?
My mind is unknowing
of any such luck
So I yell out the window
Answer the mail
My diary is quiet
The definitive nail
in my social coffin
I blame all the boffins
for making me fail
For an hour in the park
or an hour on the couch
With the boy of my choice
if he makes me go "Ouch!"
I will swap
all my dumb school prizes
I'm open
to dark surprises
My room faces north
But the sun's
in the south
You are far out of reach,
perfect hand, perfect mouth
I'll barter my freedom,
I'll trade all my medals
Please keep me in dreams
I don't want commitment,
I don't want the drama
I just want your dreams
I just want your genes
Are you sure you
want me to sing it?
Of course, I couldn't
sing it like that.
I wrote it for you.
And do you think we might
do that one at the concert?
Absolutely,
we need that song.
I don't know, James.
If you two
don't get together,
then every song
and every film and every book
I've ever heard, seen,
and read are wrong.
It's different for us.
She makes songs.
She writes them.
She's a character in them.
It's her world,
and it's her private place,
and it's the only thing that
really means anything to her.
I don't suppose there's ever
been so much repression
of true feelings
since Stalinist Russia.
Letter!
-Hi.
-Hi.
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Are you okay to be here?
Yeah, they know I'm here.
They let you out
pretty late.
Uh-huh.
Um.
I think I might
go to college.
Music school in London.
What do you
think about that?
Um, I think,
why would you do that?
Well, why not?
'Cause you're already
better than anyone there.
'Cause if any of the teachers
at this college
had a fifth of your talent,
they wouldn't even be there.
Because they're just gonna
try and make you sound like
some asshole from TV.
Well, I need
to go somewhere.
o, you don't.
-Yes, I do.
I do, okay.
I need order.
And I need structure.
And I need people.
Grown up people.
I mean, what
are you gonna do?
-What does that mean?
-What are you gonna do,
you're just gonna sit around
here for the next ten years
getting more tired
and fed up with everything?
You say we can make records,
how can we make records?
You need money to make the kind
of records you wanna make.
And even then,
who's gonna listen to them?
You're the only person
that wants to hear them.
Well, what's wrong
with that?
You can't make records
for anyone else.
I mean, I don't care
if we made a record
and no one bloody
listened to it
as long as it was a record
that we wanted to make.
Well, I can't have that,
James.
Okay?
I just, I've been inside
my own head for way too long.
I want to sing,
and I wanna dance,
and I wanna
meet new people,
and I don't
wanna look back.
Look.
I like you,
and I like Cass.
I mean...
...I love you and Cass.
I'm just not going
back in that room.
And I'm not going back
to the hospital.
You have to go
back tonight.
You know what I mean.
I'm gonna take these
wet jeans off, okay?
Thank you.
What's the point in that?
What?
I mean, the time
for that was ages ago.
When you were
shagging Anton?
No.
What, when you
were so mental
you couldn't even
get dressed properly?
Maybe.
Maybe I didn't
fancy you then.
You fucking did.
James.
Mm?
I wanna tell you
something else.
At the start of the summer,
just before I left the hospital,
this woman came
to cut hair,
and when it was my turn,
out of the blue she just
started talking to me
and telling me that she healed
people while she cut their hair.
You didn't think
she was just some nut?
By that time I was
a nut's best friend, remember?
So anyway, a couple of weeks ago
when I wasn't doing so well
I went to her house.
So did she
cut your hair again?
No, she...
she told me to lie down.
She had this
massage couch.
She put a blanket over me
and she told me that she
practiced Christian healing.
And I said, "What if you don't
believe in Jesus?"
She said it would
still do me good.
You don't believe in Jesus?
Well, I know he was a man,
I just don't know how much
of the story to believe.
So, anyway, I shut my eyes,
and I imagined the desert,
you know, like a Christmas card
with camels in.
And then I thought,
"What if the woman's hands were
his hands, would that help me?"
And nothing happened.
But then...
my eyes were tight shut,
but I--
I know this sounds stupid,
but I felt like there was
a man standing over me.
And I was too scared to open
my eyes up, I couldn't move.
It was a strange moment,
but it was like I knew that
this was my chance, like,
like I could decide
my own fate.
So I started
saying to myself,
"I want to be better.
I want to be well.
I want to be better,
I want to be well."
Over and over.
And I suppose
that was a prayer.
After, did you feel any better?
I mean, a few days later
I started feeling much worse.
You know, seriously panicking,
paralyzed in bed.
What about now?
I feel...
different.
It's like she sort of
cleaned me out or something.
Um, do you think you'll
still play the show?
Yeah, I will.
Just don't...
don't tell Cass I'm leaving,
okay, just not yet.
Okay.
It was that sort of scrubby,
huge Jiffy bag on reception.
opened it, what did
we find in there?
The world's last cassette.
The world's last cassette.
We had to roam the streets
looking for an old car
and break into it with
a wire coat hanger,
and play the cassette
in the car,
and then we got arrested.
Which means
even if I could,
I can't get along to
the old school house
where God Help the Girl
is playing.
But anyway, you have a good gig,
don't worry about us.
One-two-three-four.
I fried my head,
I'm not a brunette
I'm a down
and dusky blonde
I am living
in a tree
When I lie in bed I see
Beyond my brother's head,
the moon, I hear the rain
I am conscious of my voice
as a tool, it's more demure
Than your friend,
the singing queen
With her matinee
good looks
She talks like
talking from a book
I speak the language
of my village, of my street
But I need a friend,
and I choose you
I'll tell you
the way I feel
The truth is crushing
like a heel
I will forget the kiss
and feel if you will, too
It's drag that
you're getting old
I'd love to think
about the year
When we sobbed,
and then we cheered
The town deserted
like a film
Your torso
crushing me
Into the country
And the tunnels,
and the fields
I read a book a day
like an apple
But I did not eat
And so the doctor
came to me
She said,
"A woman does not live
By the printed word
Forgive yourself
and eat"
Autumn sped along outside
Trick photography
on speed
I was locked
inside a room
They made a deal,
they would control
The simple things
like bodies
But I kept my soul
When I needed someone
I chose you
Because the fledgling soul
awakes
And on the balcony
she quakes
And she is waiting
for the sign
And when her brother
does not come
And when the sister's
much too young
She chooses you
Just wait one minute,
and I'll walk you down.
Okay, I get that
most of the things
that Eve says about me
are true.
I think she thinks I'm too
opinionated and bitter.
I know she thinks I just
wanna be comfortable.
But what's so bad
about that?
At least it's an ambition.
I just want a period
of controlled happiness.
Yeah, but you do it at
the expense of living,
of all experimentation,
of all--
Wai--wait a minute, you don't
get to come in here.
I'm telling my side
of the story,
I've been waiting
all summer to do it.
Okay, sorry.
I've always dreamed
of making a record.
I've always dreamed that
I could place a small flag
in the timeline
of pop history.
This might seem preposterous
to you, but you know what?
Fuck off,
this is my dream.
I just wanted to play a part,
but I never thought I could
till Eve came along.
Never came close.
Without wanting
to sound blasphemous,
I am the voice crying
in the wilderness,
and she is my Messiah.
I might not be fit to tie
her musical boot laces,
but I could've
helped her make records.
I could've listened
to her songs
and backed her up on simple
yet accurately played guitar.
I could've designed the sleeves,
distributed the flyers,
licked the envelopes,
whatever, I would've done it.
Eve may go on to greatness,
but according to me
the greatness already
happened this summer.
The greatness of this summer
came from somewhere else.
Just for a moment we were
all in the right place,
and the possibilities
were infinite.
Now I'll go
back to my room.
Eve will get
on the train
to a grown up life
free from neurosis.
Cassie will wonder
for a few moments,
"What the hell
just happened?"
before she gets torn back
into her own living delights
and active miseries.
And I'll go
back to my room.
Was she on it?
Yeah.
Do you want a lift?
Yeah.
I am the singer
I am in the singer
in the band
You're the loser
I won't dismiss you
out of hand
You've got
a beautiful face
It would
take you places
You kept running
You've got money,
you've got fame
Every morning, I see
your picture from the train
Now you're an actress
So says your resume
You're made of card
You couldn't act your way
out of a paper bag
You got lucky
You ain't talkin'
to me now
Little Miss Plucky
Pluck your eyebrows
for the crowd
Get on the airplane
You give me stomach pain
I wish that you were here
We would've had a lot
to talk about
We had a deal then
We nearly signed it
with our blood
An understanding
I thought that you
would keep your word
I'm disappointed
I'm aggravated
It's a fault I have,
I know
When things don't
go my way I have to
blow up in the face
of my rival
I scream and rant,
I make quite an arrival
The men are surprised
by the language
They act so discreet
They are hypocrites,
so fuck them too
I always loved you
You always had
a lot of style
I'd hate to see you on
the pile of nearly made its
You've got
the essence, dear
If I could have a second skin,
I'd probably dress up in you
You're a star now
I am fixing
people's nails
I'm knitting jumpers
I'm working after hours
I've got a boyfriend
I've got a feeling that
he's seein' someone else
He always had a thing
for you as well
Blow in the face
of my rivals
I swear and rant,
I make quite an arrival
The men are surprised
by the language
The act so discreet
They are hypocrites,
forget them
So fuck them too
La la la-la-la la-la la la
La-la la la-la
La-la la la-la la
La la la-la-la
la-la-la la la
La-la la la-la
La-la la la-la
La-la la la-la la
One fine day
I'm gonna leave this town
I'm gonna run
with the deer
I'm gonna swim
like a swimmy thing
I've had it with this,
girl, I've had it with you
At least look at me when
I say that we're through
I did it,
I dumped you first
No one can say that
I got there last
It's been
boring for ages
Now I'm turning a page
Let's be clear,
I dumped you first
Look at me, I'm just
a boy in the wood
And I loved your city
for the way that it looked
And, girl, I loved your body
and I loved your hair
It's a gift to the world, and
it's a gift you should share
And I did it,
I dumped you first
No one can say that
I got there last
It's been
boring for ages
Now I'm turning a page
And let's be clear,
I dumped you first
It's been
boring for ages
Now I'm turning a page
And let's be clear,
I dumped you first
