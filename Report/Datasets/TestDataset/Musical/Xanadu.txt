What the hell? Guys like me
shouldn't dream anyway.
And the world shines
for me today
Thought I could never
Feel this way
And the dawn breaks
across the sky
Suddenly came the dawn
From the night
And the world shines
for me today
Thought I could never
Feel this way
What the...
Hey, Sonny. Never thought
we'd see you back here again.
Yeah. Well, I'm not exactly
thrilled about it.
Yeah. You said this place
made you crazy.
I decided I'd rather
be crazy than hungry.
"The calculation is sensitive to the
time you plan to own your house.
"The factor increases if you pay
off your mortgage in five years."
JO: Five years?
He'd be lucky
if he paid off the movers.
Who could pay off a house
in only five years?
Hey, rock stars don't even
need that long. They pay cash.
"A million dollars, man? See my manager.
I'm busy, you know."
Last one in, first one home.
SANDRA: Hey, it's Sonny.
JO: It's Michelangelo Malone.
Michelangelo, glad you're here.
The ceiling needs painting.
Uh-huh, all right,
that's enough.
Well, the great Sonny Malone
returns to AirFlo Records,
welcomed by cheering throngs
of thousands.
Art world fails to suffer.
News at 11:00.
Cut it out.
You know I wouldn't come back
to all this unless I had to.
You know, we were all
really pulling for you.
Yeah, you know, like
one of us breaking away.
Going out on his own.
Really doing it.
Yeah, no paint by numbers, no
assembly line art. So what happened?
It's what didn't happen.
No bread.
I fought it, that's for sure.
Don't worry.
I spend my whole life painting
what other people want.
I paint his van.
I paint somebody else's mural.
I paint Simpson's album covers.
Then when I finally quit
to freelance,
not only do I almost
starve to death,
but I can't figure out
what I wanna do.
Well, you can try it again.
You will, won't you?
Look who decided to drop in.
Where's your white flag?
You have a way with words,
Simpson. You know that?
Same old wise-ass attitude.
I thought we discussed this on the
phone when I decided to take you back.
We did. But I have one question.
Why the hell did you
take me back?
Simple. You're good, and you're
the fastest painter around.
But this time no more artsy-craftsy
Sonny Malone touches, huh?
Just enlarge the album cover
the way I give it to you.
Am I coming in loud and clear?
Yeah. Good. Here.
You're on your way to your
next masterpiece. Get started.
That's great, isn't it?
Picasso only gets
to be called a genius.
I get to be called
the fastest painter around.
Hey, Sonny, I have this terrific friend.
You interested?
Not right now. Hey.
RICHIE:
Mmm, she's great looking.
I think that's this crazy girl
I just ran into.
Yeah? I was walking
through the park.
She nearly ran over me,
then she kissed me.
Okay, now, let's hear
the X-rated version.
What did you do?
Nothing. She took off.
She took off? Come on!
Is this the same Sonny Malone
that drives women crazy?
I'm gonna go find out
who she is.
You mean right now?
Hey, you're definitely gonna be a
successful artist, Malone. You know why?
Because you're nuts! SANDRA:
Simpson's gonna kill him.
Listen, Sonny, I told you.
I don't know who she is.
She never filed a W-2
and she never got a check.
And if I never paid her,
she just doesn't exist.
What do you mean,
she doesn't exist?
I'm looking right at her. She's
on the Nine Sisters album.
Not if I didn't pay her,
she isn't!
PHOTOGRAPHER: Down here at me.
Now look to your right.
Yeah, that's good.
Listen, Sonny,
I don't know who she is.
How can you not know who she is?
You took the picture.
Listen, this sounds strange, but there
wasn't supposed to be a model on this cover.
I snapped maybe 100 shots.
In one of them, this girl
just jumped into frame.
The next time I saw her
was on the contact sheets.
I liked it, so I used it.
That's the whole story.
She just appeared?
No, no, appeared
then disappeared.
Now, don't you go spreading this around.
This is one of my best covers.
Why do you want to know
who she is, anyway?
I like her.
Hey, Lou. You seen
her around here?
No. Pretty. Hey, you're single, right?
Let me show you my daughters.
That's great, Lou. I'm gonna go
look where I saw her this morning.
MAN: Come on, get your balloons.
MAN: Seventy-five cents.
MAN 2: I'll meet you later.
MAN 3: All right.
MAN: Come on, come on over here.
Hi. Hi.
I'll take one, please.
There you go. See you.
MAN 4: All right, come on now.
Hey, mister.
What are you doing up there?
Hope you don't mind
a little noontime music, kid.
A little lunchtime serenade?
I don't mind. It's kind of nice.
But I was just wondering
where they laid out the body.
I mean, you got something
a little more upbeat?
Sure.
Better?
At least it's faster.
Here, give me a hand, kid. Sure.
Boy, oh, boy, they sure don't
make rocks like they used to.
Want some popcorn? Yeah, thanks.
You work around here, kid?
Pretty near. I'm over
at AirFlo Records.
You in the music business?
What are you? Are you a record producer?
A sound engineer?
No. I'm sort of a painter.
You, you paint
at a record business?
Well, not exactly paint. What I
do is, I duplicate record covers.
But why?
I make album covers bigger so you can
hang them outside record stores.
Promotion. Sounds like
an interesting job, huh?
Yeah. Sounds like you should
take real long lunch hours.
You got it.
You know, I used to be
in the music business,
but now I'm
what you might call retired.
It's a refined name for "bum."
SONNY: I don't believe it.
Hey! Hey, wait a minute!
Hey, kid. Hey, wait up!
Where are you going?
Hey, you! Come on! Hold on!
Oh, hi. Listen, I gotta borrow this.
I'll bring it back.
Sure. If you bring
it back in person.
You got it.
Hey!
Hey, wait a minute!
Where are you going?
MAN: Get that bike off the pier!
Oh, shit!
Whoo!
You're a real Errol Flynn, kid.
What other stunts do you do?
Man, this whole thing
is screwing me up.
What whole thing? Ah, nothing.
Come on, have a cup of coffee.
Sometimes the best person to
tell something to is a stranger.
Go on. What's on your mind?
Okay.
I run into this girl
this morning.
Never saw her before in my life.
She kisses me and disappears.
So what's so weird about that?
What's so weird about that is
that 10 minutes later I see her picture
on an album cover I'm supposed to paint.
I mean, that's crazy, right?
Well, if I said it sounded crazy,
would you stop looking for her?
No. Then why ask?
So I'll keep looking for her.
Okay, kid, but take
a tip from me.
What's that?
Don't look underwater anymore.
Thanks a lot.
Hey, Al, where you going?
Hey, Sonny.
It's good to see you, man.
How you doing, Big Al?
How could I go wrong with the great
paint job you did on my van?
Hey, and the chicks love it.
Yeah. It's one of the
finer examples of my work.
It's beautiful, man.
Where you headed?
East. Where you going? West.
Hang on. I'll give you a ride.
No, that's cool.
Forget it. I owe you one.
All right. Okay, hit it.
AL: Relax and enjoy it, man.
We're taking the scenic route.
SONNY: Yeah, just don't forget
I'm back here.
SONNY: Hey, that's the place
on the album cover!
Slow down, I wanna get off here.
AL: Here? Thanks for the ride.
AL: Anytime, Sonny.
Wow.
You.
Me.
Hey, I've been asking
about you all day.
You may not believe this, but I'm
painting an album cover and you're on it.
Why shouldn't I believe it?
Because before today,
I never laid eyes on you.
Now I've seen you three times
in one day.
That's a little
too coincidental.
Sounds like
you don't believe it.
Well, with all
that's happened to me today,
to tell you the truth,
I don't believe it.
You're right. It's too coincidental.
Someone must be setting us up.
What do you mean?
Hey, wait a minute!
I didn't have anything
to do with this!
Really?
Yeah, really, I didn't.
Hey!
Who said I was talking
about you?
You come here often?
Yes. I can practice my skating
and no one bothers me.
You must live around here then.
Sometimes.
Say, you think we could...
See each other again?
Yeah. Would you like that?
Why?
I don't know. I don't have
a very good reason.
I'd just like to see you again.
Where are you?
I don't know where
I'm supposed to look.
We'll see each other again.
Bye, Sonny.
How'd you know my name?
Hey, wait a minute!
I don't know your name.
Kira.
I was in big trouble.
So what did you do about it?
Nothing. Hi, Sonny.
What are you doing here?
It's early.
Yeah, it's really early.
I'm working.
Well, that's wonderful.
RICHIE: Oh, hello there.
Why, do you know
you bear a strong resemblance
to a fellow by the name
of Sonny?
Oh, yeah. He works here.
Always comes in late, though.
Say, that's pretty damn good.
SIMPSON: It is. It's too good.
That's what's wrong with it.
It is supposed to look exactly
like the album cover I gave you.
Is that too difficult?
If you want me to work,
I'll work.
If you want to stand there and
argue, I can get into that, too.
Don't be a wise ass, Malone.
That painting should be done.
What are you wasting
all this time on the girl for?
Because that's how
she really looks.
I don't give a damn how she really looks.
Just get it finished.
Now, when are you gonna
have it done?
Well, I'd say it probably
will be done
when it's done.
But that's only
an approximate guess.
Five minutes, my office.
If it's six, keep walking.
Sonny, what did you do?
Nobody likes it, but we all
say yes and then forget it.
It goes with the job.
Four minutes.
What difference does it make?
I'll say it's Tuesday,
he'll say it's Wednesday.
So, big deal. Tell him it's Wednesday.
What does it cost?
Oh, nothing.
Maybe just the truth.
Just go in there and agree with him.
That's all he wants.
You want me to say that
Tuesday's Wednesday, right?
Everyday of the week.
Three and a half minutes.
All right!
I'll be right back.
Sit down.
You think you're pretty special
around here, don't you?
No. I never said I was special.
Well, you're not.
I mean, you didn't discover art, you know.
Who do you think did that?
I did. Surprises you,
doesn't it?
No, not really.
Now, I've got an office,
I make a lot of money,
and people respond when I call.
That's because I smartened up
and I gave up art.
I think you made
the right decision.
I want you to smarten up, too.
Start doing things the company way,
not the way you want to do them.
But sometimes I see more in these
covers than what's really there.
That's art.
Just paint what
you're told to paint.
If you start making changes, then
other people start making changes.
And before you know it,
you got a lot of people
running around,
doing what they want to do.
That's not a company.
That's chaos.
Now, I want you to hang
some of your precious covers.
Pick up the van and hustle your
butt over to the Platinum Palace.
Tuesday's Wednesday.
Hey, clarinet. How you doing?
Hey, what do you say, kid.
What're you doing up there?
Trying to get down.
Grab a hold of the ladder.
Sure.
Hey, if we keep meeting like this, we
might  well introduce ourselves.
Sonny Malone. Danny McGuire.
Malone and McGuire.
Sounds like a vaudeville team.
What you got there?
Oh, this is a real gem.
I've been waiting months for it.
Ah, Glenn Miller.
You wouldn't know about him.
He was before your time.
So was Beethoven,
but I know who he is.
Do you like Glenn Miller?
Do you like rock and roll?
I love rock and roll.
I love Glenn Miller.
This place is incredible.
It belonged to a silent
movie star.
Obviously, they did
things big in those days.
What do you do
with all this space?
Nothing really.
But I love this room because it
makes my records sound great.
Well, I've only got
one thing to say.
Remember, I gave you
some popcorn.
Okay. But you came
here to listen to Glenn Miller.
So, all set up. There he goes.
Nothing like that sound, huh?
That sound was a miracle.
Hey, Danny, that's you.
Yeah.
Hey, this girl...
Danny, there's this girl...
Listen.
That's me.
Hey, that's all right.
You got any more surprises?
This is what I call
my memorabilia room.
Sort of the story
of Danny McGuire.
Tommy Dorsey, Benny Goodman.
You really knew those guys?
Yeah. We used to all
hang out together.
After I toured with Miller,
I got my own band
and my own club
on West 51 st Street.
It was small and jam-packed,
but everybody who was in town
would drop by.
Sometimes they'd sit in
for a set or two.
Well, now it's a parking lot.
Why did you give it up?
Oh, it was one of those
turning points
where you turn
in the wrong direction.
It was a girl.
The girl on the album.
Yeah.
The singer with the band.
When she left,
I figured she'd be back,
and I wasn't about
to run after her, right?
Boy, did I teach her a lesson.
Never saw her again.
After that, the heart went
out of my music.
I went into the family
construction business
and became what
they call comfortable.
Three cheers for comfort.
You ever think about
going back into music?
No. Only about
So, you gonna do it?
Well, I can't play clarinet
like I did in the old days.
But you know something, kid? I'd
love to open up another joint again.
Why don't you?
I've had real estate agents
looking for two years.
They can't find the right place.
Well, if it's just a place you
want, that seems pretty easy.
No, it's not easy. It's kind
of like falling in love.
You gotta feel a special
attachment, a special...
Like you and your friend...
Kira.
Kira.
Hey, why don't you help me look?
Maybe you can come up
with something.
Me?
Sure. You've got a good eye.
Stranger things have happened.
Yeah, I guess they have.
Listen, I gotta go.
I understand.
I'll let myself out? Sure.
So long. See you around.
Now how'd that kid figure
out about us?
I guess it still shows on me.
You're getting old, boy.
I'm getting old, babe.
You wouldn't even know me now.
But I'd know you.
me...
Yes, I'd certainly know you.
You know you've got
the kind of kisses
But I remember... everything.
Oh!
How I remember.
No other face could
take you off my mind
I'm never gonna  you free
BOTH: Whenever
you're away from me
I only have to close
my eyes dear
On  breeze
seem to hear your name
I only have to close
my eyes dear
KIRA: Hello. Hey!
Oh, I'm sorry.
You scared the hell out of me.
I'm sorry if I disturbed you.
I tried to be quiet.
How long you been
standing there?
Just a few seconds.
Should I go? Oh, no, stay.
You paint beautifully.
This is the first time I've cared about
what I've painted in a long time.
That's a shame.
It must be frustrating to
waste your talents on things
that don't really matter to you.
Yeah.
I met a guy the other day. He told
me I should take long lunch hours.
A guy?
Yeah. Someone I met
at the beach.
He's got this crazy idea
he wants to build a club,
and he asked me
if I'd help him find a place.
All the real estate agents in
this town, he  me, right.
That's not such a crazy idea.
You've got a good eye.
That's what he said.
If it's a place you want,
what about this one?
My place, where we met.
That? Forget it.
I think it has a very special
aura about it.
It's a dump!
You're supposed to be an artist.
Use your imagination.
Thanks a lot, I'm all out.
You know, I really think
you believe that.
I've had enough for tonight.
Come on, let's get out of here.
Okay.
What's this?
Shh, we gotta be quiet.
I thought we were going skating.
I wanna show you
the special studio first.
Only the biggest groups
get to record here.
It's really kind of magic. Mmm?
Yeah. They flash all sorts
of pictures on screens.
Really? Can we see it?
Straight ahead.
But pictures
in a recording studio? Why?
For inspiration.
Oh, inspiration. Sounds perfect.
I've only watched them do this
a couple of times before.
Let's see...
Turn on that one. And this.
I don't know how to
make the whole thing work.
Do everything. Go on. Press them all.
I don't wanna break it.
Then press them carefully!
What the hell.
I didn't like the job anyway.
Let's see...
Now will we see the magic?
Sure. Come on.
Careful.
She walks in,
and I'm suddenly a hero
I'm taken in,
my hopes begin to rise
Can't you tell
I'd be so thrilled to see
SONNY: You make it seem
I'm so close to my dream
BOTH: Suddenly the wheels
are in motion
Suddenly I don't need
the answers
'Cause
I'm ready to take
all my chances with you
If you dare to say
what you should say
You make it seem
I'm so close to my dream
Suddenly the wheels
are in motion
Suddenly I don't need
the answers
'Cause
I'm ready to take
all my chances with you
Longing to spend every moment
of the day
Suddenly the wheels
are in motion
Suddenly I don't need
the answers
'Cause
I'm ready to take
all my chances with you
Hey! What the hell's
going on in here?
Malone! ls that you?
No, it's not me. It's
somebody else. Yes!
Do you have any idea how much
this equipment costs? Huh?
Oh, shit!
KIRA: That was great.
You were great.
Our first dance together.
Followed by our first
being-kicked-out together.
Now I want to go somewhere else.
Where?
Find out more about you.
You know enough about me.
I wanna know about you.
I'm serious.
So am I.
Well, after all that, do you think you'd
let your imagination roam a little?
Look, I won't even start
in on that one.
SONNY: What are you doing?
What do you think you're doing?
KIRA: Oh, nothing.
Oh. Well, well, well.
Now, what a coincidence.
Look where we just happened
to end up.
You think you're real clever,
don't you?
Well, I just didn't want you to close
your eyes to any possibilities.
You really think
this could work out for Danny?
I think this place could be
anything you want it to be.
See, it's simple.
Your friend has a dream,
and you want to be involved in
something you really believe in.
Well, maybe his dream is big
enough for the both of you.
So here we are. Someone who believes
that dreams come easy, and...
Someone who doesn't know
what they believe in.
So just think about it, okay?
Just think about it.
DANNY: You gotta be kidding.
This place?
They used to have
wrestling here.
SONNY: So it's got
a history of success.
It needs some fixing up. I
think it could look terrific.
Kid, you don't need a builder.
You need a demolition team.
Look, I know it's a wreck now, but
I can see it coming to life again.
Just check it out, Danny.
That's all I'm asking.
DANNY:
Well, what put you onto this?
SONNY: A girl.
DANNY:
Oh, that explains everything.
Hey, Danny, don't you think there's a
certain kind of aura about this place?
Well, if that's what you call
it, it's got it all right.
Let's see the rest of it.
Of course, it's not small and
intimate like my club in New York.
But then again, that was back in
And this place...
Whoo. Sure is big.
SONNY: Yeah, it is.
Yeah. Well, I don't know.
I don't know.
Naturally, I can't take
all this too seriously.
But if I were going to do something
about it, and I can't say I am
because, you see, I'm a builder,
and a builder has to take his
time deciding these things.
But if I were going to
do something about it,
just speaking hypothetically,
it just might work.
You think so?
Might. If I planned it right.
Let's see... Stage over there.
Stairs there and there
and back there.
Kid, can you imagine it?
Imagine what?
A bandstand right over there
in that corner.
DANNY: And a big band,
like in the '40s.
No, no, no. Bandstands went out
with running boards. Over there...
SONNY: A great rock and roll band.
This is the '80s.
Real smooth dancers.
Wild trombone.
The band decked out in tuxedos.
Six guys wearing
electric orange.
Synthesizer, heavy percussion,
electric guitar.
Lots of glamor. Everybody
dressed in elegance and style.
MAN: Do it, Daddy, do it.
MAN: Yeah, man.
MAN: Yes!
I'm gonna blow
all the clouds away
'Cause there is nothing
I would rather do
Forget about the blues
tonight, sweet thing
Forget about the rules
tonight, sweet thing
Until the sun comes
creeping through
Give a girl a chance
to show some style
I know some moves
that we've gotta try
'Cause there is nothing
I would rather do
Forget about the blues
tonight, sweet thing
Forget about the rules
tonight, sweet thing
Until the sun comes
creeping through
And I'm making sure
you stay to see
Lover, tonight
I'm thinking of me
Lover, I won't take
a backseat tonight
Lover, getting on my
two feet tonight
You better get down
to healing me
Lover, I won't take
a backseat tonight
Lover, getting on my
two feet tonight
Forget about the blues
tonight, sweet thing
Lover, I won't take
a backseat tonight
Forget about the rules
tonight, sweet thing
Lover, getting on my
two feet tonight
I want to dance with you
Got some dancing to do
Until the sun comes creeping
through Got some dancing to do
I want to dance with you
Got some dancing to do
I won't stop pleasing you
Got some dancing to do
Forget about the blues
tonight, sweet thing
Lover, I won't take
a backseat tonight
Forget about the rules
tonight, sweet thing
Lover, getting on my
two feet tonight
I want to dance with you
Got some dancing to do
Until the sun comes creeping
through Got some dancing to do
I want to dance with you
Got some dancing to do
I won't stop pleasing you
Got some dancing to do
I love it! I'll do it!
Maybe I'm crazy,
but what the hell!
I haven't been crazy
for over 35 years.
I'm gonna do it. And, kid, I'm
giving you half the place.
You're gonna be my partner.
I can't do that, Danny.
I can't take that.
Why?
I don't know the first thing
about being a partner.
Well, it's easy. We share the
responsibilities and we argue a lot.
It's like being married,
without the good part.
Come on, kid. ls it a deal?
Okay. It's a deal.
What do you know!
I'm back in show business.
Now, I can't wait. I gotta look
over every inch of this place.
I only wish we could see better.
I got a flashlight in the car.
Will you get it? Yeah.
It's our first collaboration
as partners.
And, oh, partner? Partner,
what'll we name the place?
Yeah. What the hell to call it?
"In Xanadu did Kubla Khan A
stately pleasure-dome decree..."
"Where Alph,
the sacred river, ran
"Through caverns measureless
to man
"Down to a sunless sea."
"Down to a sunless sea."
Yes, Xanadu.
I'm Kira. Of course.
You're Kira.
But... But?
I mean... Don't I know you?
I don't think so.
Are you sure because...
Because?
Well, I mean... I don't know.
I was thinking that I...
Oh, I'm sorry. Forget it.
So, you're gonna do it?
Yes, we're gonna do it.
Total insanity.
Only if you think so.
Well, even if it is,
it's worth a try.
Xanadu. How do you think
that'll look on a marquee?
Hmm, wonderful. SONNY: Hey!
When did you get here?
Just a minute ago.
What'd I tell you, Danny? One minute
she's here, the next minute, who knows?
Guess what you own
half of, partner.
What?
Xanadu.
Xanadu. Xanadu.
Hi, guys.
Hey, Picasso. Hey.
WOMAN: How you doing?
Let's see, what's first
on the agenda?
Hey, who are you calling? RICHIE:
Leave a dime on the counter.
Hello, Simpson? Sonny Malone.
I wanna see you right away.
Hey, what's going on here?
Who cares what's going on. Just
get out before he gets here.
Yeah. I'll fix everything up.
I'll tell him it was a joke.
Hey, wait a minute. Relax. It's okay.
Are you loaded?
Because, when you sober up,
you're gonna be real sorry.
He should be coming in
just about now.
Malone, what the hell
is going on?
Simpson, I've worked like a dog
trying to make Tuesday Wednesday.
I couldn't do it.
I must be a failure.
Is he straight?
You told me if I didn't do things
the right way, I'd be fired.
Well, you were right.
Huh?
I'm fired!
Malone, I want you
out of here in five minutes.
That's five minutes, Malone, and if
it's six, just keep walking. Got it?
I'm doing it. I'm doing it.
I'm doing it!
You know that dream of mine
to get out of here?
Well, it's happening,
and you're all invited.
Opening night, whatever
you want, it's on the house.
You know, I always wanted
to say that line.
Shit.
Okay.
To Xanadu. To dreams.
I couldn't have done
it without you.
How is it?
Heavenly.
You're the one that's heavenly.
No, don't.
What's the matter?
Did I do something?
No.
You know, I don't know
anything about you.
Where you live,
where you were born.
There's nothing to know.
Where do you live?
With my sisters.
Where? In an apartment.
Yeah, but where's the apartment?
On the second floor.
Look, I don't even know
how to find you.
Yeah, but you always do. Okay.
That's a dead end.
What's your last name?
Same as my father's
and mother's.
Yeah, but what is it? What?
My father's or my mother's?
I don't care. Either one.
Same as mine.
Okay, I get it. No questions.
No questions, no lies.
No questions, no truth either.
Listen, you know enough
about me already.
Any more, you're gonna
get a headache.
Are you living with somebody?
Yes.
I'm living with my sisters.
I told you already.
Yeah, I know, in an apartment
on the second floor.
You'll be the way
you were before
MAN: All right.
Come on, you guys,
does anyone want some more?
Hey, hey. Give me a break. It's
only the end of the first week.
So what? We're gonna celebrate
at the end of every week.
All right. I won't argue
with that. Cheers.
Two cheers. Two cheers.
You know, when you guys told
me you were building a dream,
I thought you were crazy. Yeah?
Most people want skyscrapers
you put up in 20 minutes.
It's gonna be beautiful in there.
Thank you.
All right. See you guys next week.
You bet.
Hey, Sonny, I thought we should have
one special toast, just the two of us.
I've never had a partner before.
I've never watched
a dream come true.
Hey, there's not much left.
But, still vintage.
Only the best.
To Sonny Malone. Danny McGuire.
And Glenn Miller.
KIRA: Hello.
How's it all going?
So far so good.
Kira, I want you
to promise me one thing.
Anything.
On opening night,
I get the first dance.
Okay. You're gonna dance?
Oh, I've been known
to twinkle a toe or two.
Listen, if you're gonna dance,
you have to wear something...
That looks special.
You need some...
Glitz.
"Glitz"?
Something sharp looking.
You know, something with
a bit of pizzazz to it.
Hot. DANNY: Oh.
Well, if I need some... Glitz.
...glitz, then I gotta go get some.
Where do you go to get it?
At a franchised glitz dealer.
At a franchised glitz dealer.
Well, wherever it is

That there's gonna be a party
all over the world
But where it came from
I don't really know

DANNY: Yeah, that's right.
We're opening tomorrow night.
Well, you can bring your
TV cameras if you like,
but we're not gonna do
any of that celebrity stuff.
No, no, just people.
Anybody who shows up.
Okay, we'll see you tomorrow.
So long.
I wonder what would have happened
if I got that album to paint?
Don't worry.
Your turn will come.
Everyone gets at least one
chance at feeling like that.
Yeah. That's what they say.
That's what I say.
All right, what's next, boss?
Well, we're down to little
details. Fountains, yes.
The mirrors, yes. Next, we
need those new parking signs.
Oh, the signs are here. We
just haven't put them up yet.
Well, come on. Give me a hand.
Let's get them up.
I'll be right back. I wanna talk
to you about the sound system.
Sure.
You've made the place
look beautiful.
Just did What the kid said.
Oh, I see a little
Danny McGuire here and there.
Oh, just here and there. Don't
tell anybody, but I'm nervous.
What about?
Well, I haven't had
an opening night since 1945.
Wow! I guess I got the jitters.
Well, just pretend we're
back in 1945 all over again.
I don't have to pretend.
It is 1945 all over again.
Well, that takes care of that.
Sonny, don't worry
about that sound system.
I looked over it twice today
and it's fine.
You kids go on home.
Bye, Danny. 1945.
You did it. Tomorrow's your big day.
It's all gonna come true.
Tomorrow's gonna be the most
beautiful day in the world.
Kira.
I love you.
I love you, Sonny.
What's the matter?
All of it, everything.
We can't go on pretending
this is for real.
I know, it is hard to believe.
I can't have
these kind of feelings.
It's beginning to hurt.
This part of it was
never supposed to happen.
I don't understand.
What do you mean, "hurt"?
I know I shouldn't,
but I do, and it's crazy.
Sonny, there's something I
have to tell you about myself.
I know all I need to know.
No, I have to tell you.
I have no choice.
All I was sent to do
was to make Xanadu happen.
SONNY: I don't get it.
Sonny, you have to believe me when I tell
you that I never wanted to hurt you.
That was the last thing
I wanted to happen.
I'm not as I appear to you.
Have you ever heard the
expression, "Kissed by a muse"?
That's what I am. I'm a muse.
I'm glad somebody's
having a good time.
Please don't make a joke.
I'm serious.
I come from Mount Helicon.
I'm the daughter of Zeus. I have
eight sisters. My real name is...
Are you telling me
that's not real?
I'm trying to tell you the truth.
Why don't you believe me?
Look up the word "muse"
in the dictionary. Go on.
Page 728. Read it.
Okay. All right, I'll read it.
"Muse. Any of the
nine sister..."
Like the album cover?
Hmm.
"Any of the nine sister
goddesses in Greek mythology
"presiding over song and poetry
and the arts and sciences.
"And do you believe me now,
Sonny?"
How'd you do that?
What's going on?
The television.
NICK:
Well, well, look who's here.
Who's chasing you this time, Vargas?
The cops? Or the mob?
I told you to stay away
from Brenda Trent.
Yes, you did tell me.
What should I do, Sonny?
What'?
VARGAS: Who you talking to?
Sonny Malone. He doesn't
believe Kirs a muse.
How can you be talking to me?
You're a movie.
I ain't got time
for this, Malone.
Brends the only one
that saw me at the racetrack.
Now if the lady says
she's a muse, she's a muse.
Kira.
It's okay.
I'll take care of it. Thanks.
NICK: Good luck on the opening
of your joint, kid.
Oh, wow!
Oh, Sonny.
We've been painted
by Michelangelo.
Shakespeare's written
sonnets about us.
Beethoven's played music for us.
We're not supposed to feel
emotion or show any feelings.
Muses are just supposed
to inspire.
I fell in love.
You did?
Well, what do you think
happened to me?
It was a mistake.
I broke the rules.
Well, now what the hell
do we do, huh?
Answer that, muse!
I don't know.
I'm sorry. lt just never
should have happened.
Well, it did.
I love you, Sonny.
Kira.
I'll love you forever.
I Will.
I'll love you forever.
Kira! Wait!
Hey, painter! I've been looking for you.
Where you been?
Here.
Well, how do I look?
Aren't you gonna say anything
about my new threads?
Hubba, hubba.
Well, we're gonna
miss you tonight.
It won't be any fun without you.
I told you. I can't go.
Xanadu doesn't matter anymore.
What do you mean, it doesn't matter?
How can it not matter?
This was our dream.
Well, wasn't it?
There's no Xanadu
'cause there's no Kira.
She made it real.
So find her! Bring her back!
Dreams die.
No.
No, no, no. Not by themselves.
We kill them.
Now, if you give up,
you'll be sitting on that rock
just like I was.
I know how you feel, kid. I
felt the same way once. I did.
I didn't know
how important love is.
But let me tell you something.
Somehow, somewhere,
there's a way to get her!
If she got here,
there's a way to get there.
Believe me, kid, it's up to you.
It's up to you.
It's a lie
I don't believe it's so
It's a lie
I don't believe it's so
It's a lie
I don't believe it's so
Kira.
Sonny. How did you get here?
You didn't think I'd let you
get away from me, did you?
You'll have to go back.
Okay, I'm ready. Let's go.
I can't go with you, but you have
to get out before it's too late.
Too late for what?
Oh, please, you took
a big chance coming here.
What's going on here? I'm
taking you back with me, Kira.
It can't be done. Nobody's
ever taken anyone out of here.
Not in the whole history of...
The whole history.
I'll make them let you go.
Hey, Zeus!
Zeus, you hear me? Oh, God.
I wanna talk to you.
ZEUS: We don't use those
old-fashioned names anymore.
In any case, it's me
you want to speak to.
I've come to get Kira.
She's not leaving!
It's impossible!
That's what you think.
That's what you think.
How'd you know
I was gonna say that?
Put it this way.
I'm a good guesser.
What else do you know?
All right, then. You know this.
I'm sticking to this place
till hell freezes over.
Sonny!
You'll leave now
and you'll leave without Kira!
Why? Because other
people have dreams.
So send another muse.
You got muses running
around all over the place.
Wait... Wait a minute.
Just listen to me, okay?
Kira and I love each other.
Now I don't know how often that
happens in this kind of place,
but back on Earth,
it's pretty rare.
We need to be together.
You're leaving. Kirs staying.
No more discussions.
Those are the rules
and that's all there is to it.
WOMAN: On the other hand, dear,
rules were made to be broken.
ZEUS:
We'll talk about that later.
WOMAN: Which is later
and which is earlier?
KIRA:
Isn't anyone interested
in my feelings?
We learnt about feelings
in our mortal history class.
Yes, feelings.
I guess that's what
you call them.
I've never really
had them before.
I've never felt this way
about anyone before.
And I've never asked
to leave here. Not ever.
Not once in the whole
time I've been here.
WOMAN: No, it's true, dear, she hasn't.
Not in all these centuries.
Or is it minutes?
I do keep mixing them up.
Please, can't we just have this one night?
Just one night?
ZEUS: No, no, it's just not possible.
Goodbye, Sonny Malone.
', Kira?
Just one moment?
Kira!
My heart always on the run
to nowhere
To keep me suspended
in time with you
I get a feeling
when I'm with you
But I know for certain
Goodbye is a crime
So, love, if you need me
Suspend me in time
They'll shine in my memory
forever
To keep me suspended
in time with you
I get a feeling
when I'm with you
But I know for certain
Goodbye is a crime
So, love, if you need me
Suspend me in time
WOMAN: Maybe just
one moment, darling.
ZEUS: Well, maybe just
one moment, or forever.
I keep getting them
mixed up, too.
All right, everybody,
let's skate!
Let's skate!
Everybody! Come on!
DANNY: Go!
I don't know yet.
Up!
Hey!
