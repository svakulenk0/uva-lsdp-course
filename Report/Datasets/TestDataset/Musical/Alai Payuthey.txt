No need!!
Sit down,mad girl!
lf you keep on scolding me,l'll
not return home in the evening
Go! But,don't fall in
front of the train
lt will be problem to all
Will you both stop fighting

lf she behaves like you, why
should l fight with her?
See her hair,all dishavilled
ls this my mistake that
hair is dishavilled?
You should have tied it.isn't it?
Your sister is making plats,isn't it?
You always support sister,all others
are llnd class citizens for you
Then,why you gave birth to me?
you would have stopped after sister
See her temper
She is going to become a Doctor
and patients will be coming to her...
lf l was in death bed also,don't
take me to her
Okay,mother

Mother,Bye
Hey! wait

You told me to fall in front

the exam,that's why....
Oh! that's the reason
Sister,l am coming...
Move,move....
This side...

Grandpa,shave your face....
it's disturbing me
lt will,it will disturb you
Uncle...
l educated you & what sort
of work you have done?
Do you know,what work your
son has done?
He is also your son
Do you have doubt?
l was standing near the
spencer signal
And he & 4 of his friends
were on the bike
l don't know,whether they were
girls or boys
They wear wearing earings....
Full of smoke,do you understand?
What do you know,you & your
father will not understand anything
Why are you talking indirectly?
Mother,father saw me while
l was smoking
Bring me Coffee
Not his cigarette,he was smoking
somebody's cigarette
On his back seat,a girl wearing pant
was there on his bike
They both are sharing
a cigarette
What a wonderful scene?!
This kind of boy,born
in our family!!
Who was that girl? why are
you giving us shocks?
Mother,he is a guy like
a brother
Hey! That is very dangerous
Grandma,he is Era,
Uncle classmate
You used to tease him
calling 'Needle',isn't it?
Hey! Keep quiet
Hey! You smoke & you room anywhere
l am not bothered
Then what?!
Don't smoke with my money
you earn & then smoke
Keep one cigarette in one hand
& another in other hand
You can even keep it on
your ear also
Oh! God! ls smoking a sin?
No,No-lt's a virtuous
deed
What do you all think
about me?
Am l printing money?
When l was at his age,l didn't
even have slippers
My father used to give me
only 25 paise
l'll go to the Hotel & take
a Dosa & Coffee
Then,l'll go to College
by walking
lf we give 25 paise in Madras -
Even the beggar will return
it to me -
Father,what's the problem?
You have come up with so many
difficulties,isn't it?
Okay,we'll accept it
we'll respect you
But,for that,shouldn't we wear
slippers & walk?
Slowly,you may drop
it down
Karthik,don't talk back
Yes,l am useless
For that,why is he always
finding fault with me?
Come,Come,Raja come!!
Give me your purse
You can talk nicely,but for this
you should come to me
Okay,No need!
Hey! Wait...
Look at his haughtiness,ln this
age he is like this...
At the age of 30,didn't you
show your anger?
l said a word about your sister,and
you didn't talk to me for 5 years -
He is like you....
Karthik,where are you going?
l am going to spend my father's
money by smoking
Grandpa,all your property is going
to go in smoke
Who is he? Who is your
future husband?
Who? Who is the King
of your headweight?
Who? Who is he? Who is
your future husband?
Who? Who is the King
of your headweight?
This is very silly?
What is silly? What?
You don't know who she is
and you don't know her name -
You don't know anything
How will you find her out in the
Population of 7 Million
ln the 7 million Population,how many
women will be there?
Tell me,Tell me
ln this 3 1/2 Million Population -
How many women come under
the age group of 18-22?
ln this 3 1/2 lakhs,how many
are from Medical College?
Oh! ls she a Doctor?
Tell me,Tell me,how many?
Keep it as 1%
ln this 3500,how many girls
will go by train from Tambaram?
No,there will be atleast 2%
-70
ln these 70 girls,l should
search only one girl
That's the subject matter.
Can we not find her?
We can!!
lt might be ''Love''
lf we see each other,will love occur?
lt's all foolishness
Then,whom you saw in the
morning at 8.55-
Why are you talking about him
at 10.30 in the night?
A mad guy is eying me
on the train
What can l do for that?
Oh! Friend,My friend...
This is not love,its only lust
Hey! You shut up
lt's not a true love which
admires only physical beauty
ln your body,your hormones
work overtime
Hey! Don't degrade my love
Then,is it true love?
Oh! The love which started
from Electric train,isn't it?
Or love at the first sight?
Hey! You stupid,shut up!
l think,you like him?
Poorni,will l love someone?
who has no other job,they will love
lf you talk like this,definitely
you are in love
lt is seen on your face
What's it?
Suddenly,40 watts brightness

Hey shut up!

station has come?
Look!
See carefully,he will be

This is true,isn't it?
Madam,is it wrong?
No
Sister,keep quiet
You could have asked me
directly,isn't it?
Okay,l'll ask now

Play
Father,lf a groom of a rich family
comes to see me
What will you say?
What do you mean?
Why are you blabbering?
No,mother,if they come to
our house for fixing alliance
What are you gesturing
to each other?
Poorni,you tell me...
Shakthi,come here
l am going to study
Yes,father,they are going to
come & fix the marriage
Marriage? Whose?
Tomorrow,they are coming to
our house
But,not for me,for Shakthi
Varadharajan,a Popular Lawyer
His son,Karthik...
Shakthi,ls it true what Poorni says?
Tell me
Have l educated you for this?
For this purpose only,have we borrowed
money & put you in the Medical College?
Mother,l didn't call anyone,they
are coming on their own -
What can l do?
You have only encouraged someone,that's why
they are coming here
l didn't encourage anyone
you always find fault with me!
Mother,Karthik is a good guy
you,shut up
To educate you,she didn't marry
and is going to the office -
Do you know that?
Mother,don't scold me
This year's college fee's is paid
from her loan
She herself didn't marry,Why
are you in a hurry?
You have selected a boy...
ls this the place?
-Yes sir
They said 51 1 ,isn't it?-Yes
Park the car in the shade
Come,come
Sit down
Are you fine?
Yes,please sit down
We thought that we have come
to the wrong house -
ln quarters,all houses look same
that's why l am confused
This is the standard of
middle class family
She is Saroja
Greetings
They both are my daughters
We know them,they have come
to my house
They even sang song
Really!
Sit down,Sit down
l don't know
l won't watch all that
All are secret plans
They tortured me a lot to see her
that's why,l came...
Shall we get coffee?
You sit down
Madam,l want coffee without sugar
She won't have it
Among these two girls,which one our
son is loving?
He will not remember faces
Even when l return from my brother's
house after 2 days -
He will ask me ''Who are you''?
Younger girl Shakthi!!
Okay
Haven't you fixed the alliance for
the elder daughter?
No
ls it?
Do you prefer arranged marriage or
else like your sister -
Without giving financial burden to
your parents,you will love someone
What are you talking?
There is no harm in asking her view
Asking questions is my
Profession
They call him as a criminal lawyer
May be you will earn money
by telling lots of lies
l have brought up my son as
a successful advocate's son
l have brought up my daughters
as Queens
We don't have that status...But...
Coffee may become cold,take it
lf Queen's father starts talking
he will keep on talking...
Let him talk
What l am trying to say is...
When the children attain the
age of 20 -
There's no need to ask you & me
to take a decision
That is the law,l had brought him up
by teaching the law
Sir,l didn't bring up my
daughters like that
You have mistaken me
l am explaining to you
the law
Not only your daughter but for any
girl going on the road
lf Karthik says
''l will marry her''
We can't do anything we must
accept the choice of that donkey
Are you pointing out that you are
rich and we are beggars?
Sir,when did you get this
proudness?!!
When you completed your education?!
Or after earning money?!!
Father!!
He has come to our house
and he is saying -
That our girl and the girl on
the road are same!
Mr.Selvaraj,you have mistaken me
l have mistaken you?
Sir,you are only talking
in a wrong way
l have come here to talk about
your daughter and my son
l didn't come here to talk about
our inferiority & Superiority complexes
My son is a Computer Engineer,l thought
he will rise to greater heights
l didn't expect that he will
indulge in love affair
Sir,no one has laid a bait
for your son's love
For a while,we'll not
discuss about this
lf my son ask me,what should
l reply? Tell me that
Tell him that we are honest
people,its enough
Hey! What happened?
l think it won't suit us
we'll leave it
We'll forget everything and
let us remain friends
We'll say bye to each other
Because of this,will the earth
stop functioning?
Did my father say anything
incorrectly?
Nothing was good,they talked
incorrectly
They talked beyond their
limits
lt was like a talk between
lndia & Pakistan
Shakthi,are they both going
to marry?
Only l & you are going
to marry
We asked their permission just
for a formality,that's all
Karthik,what do you want me
to do?
lf they didn't give respect to our love
we'll leave them
But,l can't
What! You can't?
l can't leave my Parents,my house
and my dog..
That means...
This love is not a big thing to you
isn't it?
From when do you know me?
For 20 weeks...
But my Parents are like my soul
for 20 years
l can't leave ''Them'' for ''You''
But,l can leave ''Anything''
for''you''!!
Today,for a girl,you are ready to
leave your parents & come -
Tomorrow,for another girl you
will not leave me
What's the guarantee for it?
Hello,your logic is horrible
Now,what? Sacrifice?
Am l its offering?
Why our love is so deep?
We met each other & talked
You were after me for sometime
and you made me happy
But now,you are making me to cry!!
That's it!
Earlier,lf l said ''No'' to you what
would you have done?
l would have thought you are
not lucky
Now,you think like that
Shakthi,what you are saying
is right
l accept that love is foolish...
but don't leave me..
Give me some more time
For one week,till 10th...
After that also,if you feel like this
tell me
We'll leave it
What will happen in one week?
Why unnecessarily...
Anything may happen within
one week..
Hey! Be careful!
l may convince you,you may change
or l may fall in love
with someone
Hey! What are you doing?
Shakthi,only one week,okay?
Simply we'll meet & talk
that's all,okay?!
No
Today-Nungambakkam Station
Night 7.55
Shakthi,open the door
l am Karthik speaking
Dr.Shakthi's husband
Hey! Keep quiet,l am talking
isn't it?
Do you know,where is Shakthi?
No,she has gone from the
hospital around 5.30
Has she not yet come
to the house?
No,l am calling from outside,she
might have gone home by this time
ls Raji there?
Hai Karthik,l am Raji speaking
How are you?
How is Shakthi?
How about you?
You are very busy,isn't it?
You are not coming to
meet us
They said,you have given
birth to a child
Yes,baby girl
We'll come & meet you
in the weekend
Come with Shakthi
-sure
Karthik,don't want this
Leave it means leave it
Are you sure?
Okay
l pray to God that you get
an ugly & foolish wife!
Be like this,don't change
Always crying?
No,always smiling!!
For how many days you will
continue like this?
What do you mean by
how many days?
Hiding yourself like this instead of
train,you are going by bus,auto..
lf we leave anything we
should really leave it
lnstead we should not encourage love
its foolishness to test it
l don't want to do that
foolishness
What's it?
We'll succeed like Bill Gates
Or we'll go to jail like Financial
firms who won't return the deposits
Begining itself,he is talking
negatively
From today onwards,Cinema,House
Girls...all are stopped
ln the 1st year,we'll grow up
in Madras
And in the 2nd year - All lndia No.1
ln the 3rd year-lnternational
Future stars,shall we start

Hey! Take that camphor packet

Who's it?
Hey! lt has become your habit,isn't it?
Shakthi,why are you not
talking?
Has the line got cut
-No
Then talk...
l won't listen to all
these things...
Where is your father?
Hey! Where are you?
Did you not say that after
finishing her Medicine -
We'll perform the marriage of Shakthi
with my son?
Mother,while coming from home
what did l say?
You keep quiet
Only she must have refused it
She doesn't like our
family at all
What all l did for him?
He had grown up by eating
my food...
Hey! You have promised me! Don't
cheat your own sister
Sister,who is cheating whom?
How can l fix the marriage of Shakthi
before Poorni?
Hey! Who got the job for you
in Railway?
Why are you talking about
that now?
After my husband's death,l recommended
you for that job
Do l have to die returning
back that job?
Father!!
You will talk like this
Your daughter has done Medicine
isn't it?
l came here to remind you
that,don't forget us
One day or other,this Aunty will
parcel you & take you in the bag
Shakthi,have you got my point?
Shakthi,they are starting the old stories
trying to marry you to him
Be careful!
What are you doing here?
Where is Shakthi?
l thought you both had
separated
Yes,but..
Then what?
Nothing,since 4-5 days she has not
to be seen...where is she?
She has gone to U.S
Why?
She has not gone to U.S
She has gone for Medical
Camp,is it enough?
For 3 weeks
Only for 3 weeks!! She will come back
here only
How much money do you want?
Rs.2000/-
Why that much money?
Mother,l am going to town
Don't ask me why?
lf father comes to know about this,he
will break the house into two
Before that,you somehow arrange
the money & keep it
ls it for that girl?
Bye!
Be careful,come back quickly
Someone is playing the music!!
l am staying in the darkness
and listening to it!!

They have gone to
some other place
Someone is playing the music...

Some one is playing the music...
l am staying in the darkness and
listening to it!
Oh! Flute,flower flute!! ''You & Me''

Oh! Flute,flower flute!! ''You & Me''

Uncle it's she...
Wait
Don't think that
Poorni is quiet girl!
lf she starts talking,she'll
discuss about the Whole world!
There's only one problem,
she is very intelligent -
For that you'll have to co-operate
its possible,isn't it?
l'll try
Shakthi being the last kid,her father with his
indulgence brought her up differently!
But Poorni is
not like that -
She is patient
and a humble girl -
She goes to the Bank for her job and
she's also very responsible in her house
She doesn't get
angry at all
What about our Raghu Brother
he is a complete Saint
Because of him,l have
a bad name
From our side its okay
What,Raghu,is it fine?
We'll have to ask Poornima whether she
likes,and is it okay to her?
Poorni will agree for it -
Don't worry
about that
Please...
Tell,Uncle!
lf its okay from your side,on an
Auspicious day,we'll fix the marriage
You like,isn't it?
come on tell!
lsn't he handsome?
lsn't he intelligent?
l have given the groom coffee
should l give him the kercheif also?
No after seeing our Poornima
he's becoming eulogical!
Ay,look at Uncle
While talking this,l'll tell
what l felt in my heart!...
l didn't even talk to
Shyam about this -
You also have one more daughter
l too have one more son -
He is also studying medicine
even she is studying Medicine -
Let's ask both about
their opinions -
lf they like.we can perform both
the marriages at a time!
What do you say?
Madam
Don't mistake me l said
what l felt in my heart!
Come Shakthi come,don't
think Aunty,come
Good occassions come
like this only...
Mother!
-Wait!
Do they know that you have a groom
ready in your relatives itself -
Mother,its not possible
lt's possible,you go
Listen to me...
Go,he is more educated than me
stays in America
l can buy only the map of
America for Shakthi
lf something good has to happen,certain
useless have to be discarded
Mother,listen to what l say
atleast once?
First remove
Mother,please listen to
what l say?
You don't say anything
you have an evil tongue
Mother what's this uncivilized?
Going for two,silly!
Remove it
-Why?
You should atleast wear a
Silk saree and some jewels
Should you be
like this jewel less?
What's this? All this time l was
like this,isn't it? -
Now,why this
silk saree?
l'll remove!
Take
Wear them on your ear,and
around the neck
This is very indecent
ls this a discount business
buy one and take one free
Mother,its not possible listen
to what l say
Don't spoil the Poorni's proposal
Come
Come...
Suddenly
After hearing to
the proposal...
l am sorry,its a
little embarrasing
Had l knew,that they'll trap
me like this...
Father is always like this,he'll
burst out whatever he feels
lf l tell you honestly all my
family members have a fear -
Whether,l'll marry some U.S girl
a black girl etc...
That's why with Raghu's marriage
they are trapping me also!
Had they said
it yesterday
But today after seeing you
l don't find anything wrong in it!
What happened?
You talked a lot when you
wore a Churidhar
Now,after wearing a Saree
you have become speechless
Tell me truthfully whether
l am okay or not?
l am already married!!
Parent's don't know
about it
Leave me alone!
Sir,what's this...?
Father...

What are you searching?
The Auspicious thread!!
You sinner! Are you

Me...? Are you blaming me
after losing it
The time is not good,if anything happens

Leaving me,you are searching for the

Coming,Coming,Coming...
Don't shout
Don't lose my papers
Shakthi,tomorrow l have
a presentation -
These papers....
Shakthi,that report....
The care you're showing,when
you saw me!
lf you have even a little,when you
do not see me,would be much better!
You didn't even see whether
we are alive or....
l do have care for you in plenty
only you're not recognizing it!
Not a day passes without your
thoughts and its distress!
Have you ever felt distressed
with my thoughts?
You would have only cursed me
isn't it,sister?
How are you?
How many time l would have
called Nadar's stores!
Did you come even once
on the line?
You too have left me,isn't it?
Mother,how's father?
He has been Hospitalised!
Mother! Why? What happened?
What do l know? Did l study Medicine?
That's...what did they say?
Did they say it as Jaundice?
Have they diagonised it lmmediately?
Mother,why has he been admitted
into a Hospital?
l want to see father immediately!
Don't tell him that,l had met
you and talked with you!
He'll get better,if
he sees you!
l have come here to beg you,to
come & see your father!
Hey! Didn't you go to work?
lt seems father isn't keeping
good health!
We'll go and...
...We don't have parents!!!
You have only''me'' and l have only''you''
that's what you had said!
He has been admitted into
the Railway Hospital!
Shakthi! Who told you that?
Why do you want that?....
Who told you?
Mother told me!
l met her in the Train!
Without coming to Home!
Without my knowledge
only for you!
Karthik,please listen to
what l say?
He's just an ordinary
Railway Employee!
He struggled and took loans to
make me study Medicine!
Now,he's not well!....
lf l don't go there now,what's
use of me studying Medicine?
Okay! You go and see him!...
....But,l'll not come!!
Karthik,Can't you do atleast
this for me?
Shakthi! Do you want me to come there
throwing away my honour,prestige!
He has slapped me!
....l can never forget it!
Even my own father has
never beaten me!
lt's better to die than to come
face to face with him!
ln this world l don't have even
lf l want you,l have to
forsake them!
lf l want them,then,l have to
forsake you! How is it possible?
Shakthi,do whatever you feel
like doing?
lf You want them,
go their home,Go
lf you want to come back
or may be not!
Do whatever you want to do?
But,Please leave
me alone!
Just one marriage means
so many troubles!
l don't know how people
marry 2 or 3 times?
Our Rohit will marry....
...2 or 3...
How is your father?
How do l know?
l had told you to go
and see your father!
You had even told about
killing yourself!
Okay!....
Tomorrow,we both will go!
No Karthik!
We'll not go to the House
who don't respect you!
Leave that aside!
Tomorrow morning we'll go!
You go inside and see him!
l'll stand outside!
Please,you also come inside!
Let him see that we are
happy together!
Are we really happy?!
You're going to get
beating for this!
Karthik,if he talks anything
out of anger-
You'll not take it
seriously! isn't it?
Even if he slaps me again
l'll bear it!
Shouldn't you have come
a day before?
l have lost my brother....
Hey! You have become the cause
of death of your father!
Father! Look,l am Shakthi!
who has come
lf you had come early you would
have met your father!
Father,Shakthi has again
come back to our House
Father,please,open your eyes!!
and see for once
Mother,why did you give
birth to me?
Mother,why did you bring me up
like an obstinate girl?
The day when l spoke
illmannerly!
lf you had broken my limbs and
threw me in a corner!
Would this had happened?
Mother,why did you allow me to
go out of the House?
ls your mistake!....
Dream of making me a Doctor....
...He never had any other wish!
Mother,when he wasn't well
where was l?
Why do you need marriage
and family?...
...Saying this why didn't you beat me
and brought me back to Home?
Why did you
leave me?
Was he so angry on me?
He left without even seeing me!
l have done a mistake....
....l have done a great mistake!
Mother,tell me to say that
he has forgiven me!
Mother,atleast you tell that
you have forgiven me!
Mother...atleast you...
No need for all that!
Whatever you may say....
Even for 1 minute can you make your
father come alive before me?
lt is not possible....isn't it?...
...Then don't talk!
Get out!!
They won't inform and go from a
House of death!...Go!
Because of our marriage,Poorani's
marriage was broken!
Both homes broke up,and one even
went up to the cremation grand!
How am l going to face Shakthi?
Till his last,he left with anger
He died with a sorrow forgetting
a daughter like me!
She pestered....but l didn't
take her there!
l could have taken her there and
spoken with him!
l was obstinate!
Okay! Leave it!
Why do you want to unnecessarily take it
upon yourself and get distressed?
My father used to say always...
That he'll go only after
marrying me to a good boy
Shakthi! Elders will never
go away from us!
They'll always be with us!
He would have come to know that
Karthik is a good boy!
That's why,he has left us
and went away!
Take this coffee...
...Please have this coffee,my child!
How many more days,are you going
to cry within yourself?
Then,what do you want me
to do?!
Anger can't be dissolved
with tears!
l am not angry on anyone!
l am angry on myself
for being selfish
l had decided considering
only my choice!!
That's why,God has
done all this!
Why are you beating
around the bush?
...Why don't you say it
straight on my face?
That you have killed
my father!!
Not you....it's me!!!
Look....
...The man who's gone,isn't
going to come back!
Whenever you cry!
As if you're saying
it's all because of you!!
Tell me,if you don't want
to see me!
Even l'll also get lost!
Alright! You also go away!
After that without anyone for me
l'll distress alone and die!
What'll be my fate?
what's written in fate?...
Stop!! Enough!!
Don't talk with me for my
entire life! lt's enough!...
...What l mean to say....
No need,don't say
anything!
lt's alright! When l can live
without my father!
l can live without you also!
Don't worry!
Where are you going?
Leave me! Don't utter even a word!
lt's enough!
Hello! ls it Hyundai Factory?
Can l speak to works manager
Mr.Raghuraman?
What should l say?
lt's enough,if you say only
what is written on this?!
l wouldn't be in any soup,isn't it?
Talk softly like a girl!
that's enough!
Hello l am....
....l am unable to talk!
l'll hit you! Look here and talk!
My name is Poorni!
Soft soft soft....

Your family had insulted us
isn't that enough?
Please,only for 5 minutes!
When you're going home,l'll meet you
at Besant Nagar Bus Stop by 4 PM
l'll meet you by 4 PM only
for 5 minutes,please!!
lt seems he is that
Hyundai Guy!
Only God should save!
My family was destroyed
dispersed and perished!
Are you happy?
The day you came and went away
they had started crying...
lt hasn't yet stopped!
ls it enough?
Whatever happened,has happened?
lf you think that all was wrong because
of our wrong doings...
l don't think this
will come good...
Calling personally one who
is depressed to feel happy!
What do l do without getting
angry on such people?
Excuse me! You only called me!
Me!?!
You only called me!
Am l mad?
No! You only called my factory
to meet personally...
Not me! You only called
my bank!
Wasn't it you who had talked?
Told me to come at 4 p.m to
disrespect me personally!
Who's that,who had called
me by 4.30 p.m?
l am quitting from this game!
ls it your handy work?
Are you bringing a
couple together?
Otherwise are you working
as a Marriage broker?
l feel like using choicest abuses...
The marriage which was stopped
because of me!
A small wish that it
may happen that's all!
You have done so much
for Shakthi!
For that,l wanted to repay by
doing a good thing but...
Please forgive me!
What? ls it a flop?
ls it a bigger flop than
our company?
Come!
lts more than 10 days since we
talked with each other!
Marriage means,it'll be
like that only!
Do you know that,not a single day passes
without me and Rajesh fighting?
We were never like that!
May be Karthik doesn't
like me anymore!
Leaving you,he isn't roaming with
other girls! Why bother?
Look,everything will be alright!
l was considering you both as
perfect in all our group!
Why are you bothering yourself?
...Come...!
One ice-cream for both of you!
What did you say?...
What did she say that day...
...Am l a marriage broker to
bring a couple together?
She wanted to mouth
choicest abuses?..
Now,it doesn't seem to
look like that!
Are you both convinced?
Why are you staring?
Come on tell!...
Hey! When is the marriage?...
When is the marriage?
He has told that he'll come and
talk in another 2 days!
l want to tell you one thing...
Okay,l'll tell you later!
ln my office Rohit's marriage
has been settled!
With both families consent!
...Not like us!
Tomorrow,all my friends are going
out together!
There may be 100 problems
between us!
But no one outside should
know about it!
They are thinking that we
both are an ideal couple!
Come atleast for me!
How did you manage
to bring her?
Everything is like that only!
Now it'll be like that only!
But after marriage you're a gonner
Doomed forever!
Hey! Ashok! Keep quiet!
You seem to look like a
very good girl!
How did you deceived like
this with Rohit?
Just as l got deceived by Shakthi
Another sinner got stucked up!
Hey! What's all this guys? lnstead of
Greeting,why are you scaring me?
Buddy! You're getting really
married! No,don't do it!
lt'll be very difficult!
lsn't it?
Well said!
Hey! You'll get thrashed!
You are married and happy!
Are you scaring one who's
going to get married?
Hey Boy! You don't worry!
After marriage all men will
be like this only!
Their true colours will be out!
How,How,How....
First they'll open the car door!
After that,they'll hold
the umbrella!
After that,with great love...
they'll chase like gentlemen!
But after marriage...
After?...
Everything will fly out of
the windows!
Look at me! l am even
pressing my wife's legs!
lt's more than enough if you
don't pull my legs!
Only 25 days are remaining
for the marriage!
You get married!
The difficulties l am undergoing,let
this whole World also undergo!
Okay...Okay...Who all want
me to marry?
Who..Who...
Now who all don't want
me to marry?
Marry...but...
Tell...Tell...Tell...
My sorrow is lost...
My happiness is lost...
My happiness is lost!
September month!...September month
Lost the sorrows of the life!
September month...September month!
Lost the sorrows of the life!
October month...October month!
Lost the happiness of life!
When you lost your sorrows...
Love was born at that time....
When you lost the happiness..
You got married at that time..
September month...September month
Lost the sorrows of the life
October month...October month
Lost the happiness of life!
When you lost your sorrows...
Love was born at that time...
When you test the happiness...
You got married at
that time!
Oh girl! Love is like a feast of sweets!
Marriage is the bitterness of the neem!
Oh! My boy! Love sees only strengths
Marriage sees only weaknesses!
Oh Girl! Love is seen only by half eye!
Marriage is seen by 4 pairs of eyes!
On the tip of the noses,love enjoys
even the beauty of crows!
After marriage even mole hills become
mountains! Why this clashes?
Men without women,man can't
have the consolation!
lf women aren't there in this World
men may never need consolation!
September month...September month!
October month...October month!
l have found out the love means
heavy chains!
Marriage means Auspicious chain
what can l do?
Postpone the marriage till 90 and
come my love,let's cross 100 also?
My friend! l don't get the love's irons
and splinters in marriage's cot!
There's no happiness in relationship in
which there isn't a separation!
That's what is love!
Come let's live with sometime with relationship
and sometime with separations!
Without men,women don't
have the consolation!
lf there aren't any men in this World
there's no need for consolation!
September month...September month
Lost the sorrows of the life!
October month...October month
Lost the happiness of life!
When you lost your sorrows!
Love was born at that time...
When you lost the happiness...
You got married at that time
You have lost interest
in me,isn't it?
Why are you starting it now?
Or else has marriage become bitter?
What l said was just for fun...
lf you don't feel like that in your
heart,will it come out?
What do you mean by saying that you
have lost happiness after marriage?
You don't like me....
lt means you like
some one else!
Why are you killing me?
Whatever l do,ls
it wrong?
Then do you say that you
haven't done anything wrong?
l am like that only...
l had seen in the street corner!
Then,why did you marry me?
You should have married
the girl you like?
lt was a mistake!!...
l and you shouldn't
have married!
We should have remained
as friends!
l am able to understand very well
what you're saying!
Look!...Crying...
What cruelty have l done to you
for crying like this?
l have done the cruelty!
Leaving my parents behind
l came believing you!
That was the biggest mistake
l had committed!
Why this love marriages?
ls it necessary?
lf you don't want then get away!
Leave me also!
Even l'll live in peace!
l am unable to understand
these women!
This love...this marriage!
Marriage means...We have to sacrifice
little things for each other!
We have to keep her before
our self interest!
Throw away this Ego!
What was the reason that made
you to love Shakthi?
Meeting her in Beach
hugging in Parks!
What you see in Cinema
is not at all love!
Boy! That is not love!
lts just an infatuation
before marriage!
Flower...just like a flower!
lt'll be intoxicated,fragrant
and beautiful!
...But it'll wither away!
What you get after marriage...
...ls like Roots!
lt'll be inside the soil
rooted firmly!
Whatever may happen you must
make small sacrifices!
Sacrifice!
Want a small?!
Oh! God! How much l have
to search for you?
Are you trying to hide
from me?
l want to tell you
one thing!
But l am unable to understand
how to tell you about it?
At this age,l am
feeling shy...
Hey! Why didn't you tell me
about this earlier itself?
Did l hide anything from you?
No! Lest it doesn't end up like
previous one!
l was just waiting to finalize
everything...
l'll thrash you!
That's why l took a promise
from Karthik
That he should not reveal it you!
He's the reason behind this
our second innings!
He pursued,hit and crashed against
and brought us together!
l...Yuck!
Shakthi,don't cry
lf you cry,l will also feel!
My elder sister is very precious!
Will you look after her without
tears in her eyes?
Don't fight with him!
Be nice!

Karthik immediately!
