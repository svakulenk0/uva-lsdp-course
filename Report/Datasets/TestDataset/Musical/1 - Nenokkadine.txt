Resynced
Stay on Gautam
Now focus on him.
I killed him
Murder
I've killed those three
people who killed my parents
No...don't kill me
Three murders
Just now you appeared
in the Live TV concert.
How can you murder right now?
I can get the promotion now
No Sir, listen to me
Hey Seenu, make the FIR.

mad watching this.
Who are you?
Who are you?
Sir he is a Rockstar.
Do you think he really did murder?
He really did.
Look at him. He seem as hot as gun
just after firing the bullet.
Sir lets wait till the body is
recovered and then inform the media
I'll not be in TV till
the body is recovered.
That SP will be there.
I'll be just watching
him drinking the tea
Go and call the media.
Its my order.
Do you accept that you murdered?
It that true...do you accept that?
For you all, Gautum is a honest man.
He is a celebrity
But from now onwards he is a murderer
Killer.
Beyond the imagination,
Gautam became murderer.
Everyone is shocked
knowing about the murder.
Time has come for Gautam
to sit behind the bars.
After he ran murdering
and I hunted him down
what is the reason behind
Gautam becoming the murderer.
Revenging his parents
murder Gautam killed...
Inspector John Badshah
chased him and hunted him.
This murder revealed
other two murders.
Police said, other two murder
was done in Pune and Ireland.
Lets go and see whats
happening in real.
Its not only the success
of John Badshah...
Venkat?
Sir.
Every channel is telecasting the Gautam news...
Why is it not in our channel?
Sameera has put Gautam
news in hold Sir.
Where is Sameera?
She is in the news room Sir.
Sameera?
Yes Sir.
Why are you holding
the Rockstar news?
Getting ready Sir.
What's the matter tell me I say?
I'd shot the exclusive
visual relating to it.
Please give me some time.
Visual expert are you ready?
Ok mam.
Breaking plates ready?
Ready mam.
Videos should be played in live
as soon as after anchoring.
Go.
The talk relating to the
murder done by Rockstar Gautam
its creating the sensations.
What happened actually?
How did that murder happened?
That whole murder is
shot by our news channel.
Here is the exclusive visuals which
are beyond your expectations.
Subtitles by Nithin Prabhu
Don't stare at me.
Look there.
He seemed beating someone.
But no one was there.
He fell as if someone beat him.
But no one was beating him.
All he was alone
He was fighting with nobody.
He was beaten by nobody.
He surrendered to police
saying he murdered him.
Though Gautam didn't murdered but police
created the sensation and made him murder.
So without killing anyone
Gautam became a murderer.
This is the Gautam's reality
Here is no any dead body Sir.
What is the reason
behind doing this?
This is the things
that we should know
Who are you, son?
What happened dear?
What happened?
Tell me?
Mother...
Mother?
Mother...
what happened?
Father...
Mother...
They killed them
Where?
Here...
Mother...
Here...
They killed my Mother here.
Here...
They killed my father here.
Did any murder happen here?
Muder?
Nothing like that happened...
Why are you saying that Sir?
This boy is saying that his
parents were killed here
This boy?
This boy is always like that Sir.
Whatever bus stops here, he
immediately gets in
and says "here they killed my
mother and here my father".
He's little mentle Sir.
Don't take it serious Sir.
He doesnot have
father and mother.
Without killing anyone,
Gautam became a murder
He's little mentle Sir.
Don't take it serious Sir.
This is called interrogation
disorder in medical terminology.
Comparing to normal brain, gray matter
is 25% less in Gautam's brain.
Means it reduces the
strength to remember.
They thinks those things as
real which are fictitious.
Gautam doesn't have his
parents since childhood
He imagined them to
be there with him.
Whatever he do, that won't be ture.
That's why
he imagined they were killed by those three
who are right now trying to kill him.
Revenging them, he feel
that he killed them.
As a whole he created
a revenge story.
Knowing that all as unreal
he got very disturbed.
You don't worry. I'll treat him.
Now I'm going to ask you
something relating to your past.
Do you how does
your mother looks?
Do you how does
your mother looks?
I don't know.
Do you know how does
your father looks?
You don't know how was
your father and mother
But somebody killed them.
At least do you know the name
of your mother and father?
You don't know.
Do you know the name of the killers?
You don't know.
You don't know the name of
killers but you killed them.
So you killed those who you don't know
and where they are you don't know.
It may not be true
that I killed them
But its true that they
killed my parents.
Every patient always says that
No one will accept that
they are wrong.
I've seen such cases many times
What I'm saying is the truth.
I've the medical reports to prove
that what you are saying is not real.
What to you have?
Do you have any proof?
It this real?
Ofcourse. Damn it
How do you know?
Pain.
It pains man.
As much you feel that pain
and believe it as real
I feel mine too and
believed it as real.
Why?
Why am I not imagining you?
Why I'm not imagining you?
Why I'm not imagining you?
Why I'm imagining those three?
Because...
Those...
Those three killed my parents.
Do you think a chance that people
Gautam imagining are real?
Impossible.
What if they are Real?
IMPOSSIBLE.
What truth comes from
what type of experiment?
Which truth affect
the which company?
You are the one who knows that.
What is that? Don't you know to
whom you dare will take your life?
Do you think I stopped murdering
after entering to the politics?
Nobody can dump the truth.
Because of you company products,
the climate is polluting
causing the different types of cancer.
People are dying.
They don't have any alternatives.
So they are dying.
You know the truth that's why
I'm giving you two choices.
Do you need money?
Or do you want you life?
How many will you kill?
One...Two or Three...
Or will you kill all?
As soon as I called you came without fear.
I thought you were here for the money.
I understood that you
don't need your life.
My friend has the
information that I'm here.
If you kill me, everyone
will know about it.
Everyone says when I murder there
will be no any proof because
When I thought of murdering, these
types of accedent will happen there.
Subtitles by Mr. Kaji Tamang
Sir, again Rockstar case... If anything
unusal happens then sure suspension.

Hello...
Rockstar

Sorry. Whom do you
imagined to kill?
They tried to kill me.
Oh you imagined that?
It seems attacks did happen here.
It appears to be realistic.
But who are they to attack you?
That one Sir.
Sir killed that one with the beer bottle, right?
His men had came to attack him.
But fearing him, they ran away.
Lets go and catch
them who ran away.
But we don't know

Sir what is he searching?
What are you searching?
Camera.
What?
I've taken their photos.

You killed with the bottle,
but there won't be the body.
You take the photos, but
there won't be the camera.
You just will imagine that
and I'll get the suspened.
Once believing you
they called me a fool.
Twice believing you they will call...
John Badshah...
They'll say that because only John
Badshah knows how this happened.
How Sir?
How...? Means I'll tell you
Gautam broke like this.
Like this.
Look it.

house with Gautam.
They are telecasting
Jhon Badshah.
Due to the suspension, John Badshah in
Gautam's house breaking the things.
Tell us.
What do you say?
I haven't broke anything. Everything
is done imagining by him.
Go and ask Rockstar Gautam
Tell us Gautam?
You did this all?
Mr. Gautam can you prove that
really the attacks was real?
Things doesnot always becomes unreal
when it doesn't has any proof and vice versa
There are also the truth
beyond the camera.
Gautam.
Stop.
Gautam stop the car.
Gautam.
Real.
Fasity.
This all might not be real
But I don't need any those reality which force
me to believe that my past is falsehood.
Till now for what I
believed and lived
After hearing that were not Real.
I became unable bear it.
Thats why.... the people

which I believed it to be real.
I'm going near to that.

Everythings will come out.

How did you know that I'm here?
Your bad luck Sir.
Media. They find
where ever you go.
What do you want?
Just 10 minutes. Small interview.
Don't you know the
meaning of privacy?
Where ever you go and disturb.
Knowing the value of privacy, if I
hadn't telecasted your footage in TV
You'll not be here but
relaxing in the jail.
Just get out from here.
Fine. I know the value of
privacy so I'm going right now.
If you know the value of gratitude
then come for the interview.
I'll be waiting you.
You don't know about me.
If you say no and neglect it

Why are you coming again?
Don't you understand

A Star can live without AC but
can't survive without fans.
I'll jump in the sea
You came here?
I can't believe this.

I've been egarly
waiting for this.
I won't take times. Just 10 minutes.
That's all.
Order for the coffee.
Good idea. Lets take the interview
while drinkin the coffee.
What interview?
You said about the treat.
Generally people thinks
my interview as a treat.
Are you playing the game?
Because I said no
for the interview.
So you are lying saying
about the treat.
What treat?
came for the interview.
If you want to have coffee with
me, then ask for the coffee?
If you want the interview
then ask for the interview?
But don't act like this.
Cheap media tricks.
Look Mr. Gautam
Don't think that every girls from
India wants to have coffee with you
We journalists come for the interviews.
Not for the coffee.
So, thank you.
You arrived earlier then me?
You Rockstar shouldn't
come earlier.
The late the hero arrives,
the more will be the craze.
What happened?
Why are you looking like that?
Again did that
interview girl came?
Did she again irratated you..?
Again she tried to use you?
I swear.
I'll Kill her.
Lets order the coffee.
Lets have the coffee and
make your dream true.
I feel like an angel.
Actually... I don't know...whether
we can find here coffee or not
But in first meet, beer
won't be good, right?
That's why I said coffee.
Sorry.
Anyway I'll try for it.
I'm the real one.
You don't have to test on me.
But your touch is wonderful.
What?
Yet you don't believe me?
Wait...
Am I hot?
Did you see that? They don't
even want to disturb us.
I feel like an angel.
Where are you going?
So you are imagining swimming?
Please Please Please imagine
both of us swimming together...
It would be good.
Lets make that too true.
What? Ok?
First drink the coffee.
What the hell?
Bloody bastard. Are
you blind or what?
Are you driving drinking
alchol or what?
Bloody dog.
Stupid Jackass
Do you think this beach as
your father's property?
Bloody drunkard.
Oh shit. My coffe is gone.
Shall I bring another coffee?
What Sameera? Suddenly you
claim yourself too be hot.
Do you know I
became like a dumb.
Looking at the hot girls you boys become dumb.
That's why I asked you.
How's my double acting?
I did well, right?
Journalist looks general but
Angel looks mindblowing.
What is this? I thought you getting Rockstar
is hard but he is easily fell on you.
What are you watching?
How does Angel changes her
dress, I'm looking that.
What?
-Dress change???
Why did you record this?
To increase the TRP for
your double acting.
Why are you beating me?
Did TRP increase now?
Stupid.
What's the Gautam
program tomorrow?
What Sir? After seeing me too
why are walking so silently?
Rather than staying free,
can't you give the interview?
It's me Angel.
You believed me that I'm
interview girl, right?
Last time you missed
the coffe, right?
This Angel will go and bring the coffee.
Till then you watch them and enjoy.
I forgot something. I think I didn't come to
GOA just to have only coffe with you, right?
Then why I'm here for?
What?
It means I Love You
in Kokani language.
I really like you.
If you catch me right now then
its means NO from your side.
If not then it means
YES from your side.
If you don't catch me now then this
Angel will not leave you forever.
No.
What "No"?
Right now you said that...
Awww Tuzo Moh Karta
.
What do you mean?
As you said I Love
you in Konkani.
Excuse me.
Will you leave my hands please?
I'm saying to you?
Mr. Gautam. Why do you
visualize so cheap about me?
When I call for the treat,
you presuppose it as treat
You presume saying me I Love
You when I walk near by you.
What is your next plan?
Will you visualize
our dating or what?
Anyway you won't give
me the interview.
At least I want to cover it from a distant.
Won't you let me to do that too peacefully?
Mr. Gautam don't visualize that every girls from
India will express their love to Rockstars like you
We journalists come for
interviews not for dates.
Actually I really
expressed my love to you
But I can't tolerate no from you so
acted right now as interview girl.
Grils coming and expressing their
love to a Rockstar like you
And you rejecting them
may common to you.
But for normal girl like
me its a major issue.
I really like you.
At least give me a chance to
become your one day girl friend.
I'll keep it for my
life long memory.
You are not real.
You are just fictional.
No no no. I'm genuine.
You want me to prove it?
Everybody will envision me as mentle
if I keep talking with you.
I know you are not really here.
I'm just imagining you.
That's all.
Go.
Go.
How do you know that
I'm just fictional?
If you were real then you
won't be here bringing coffee.
You'll be talking angrily.
What?
You all men are alike.
They think our love as
fictitiuos and anger as real.
Is this angerness enough
to prove me as real?
Or do I've murder someone?
Just...just 2 minutes...
I'm giving you 120 seconds time.
I'll go and jump into the sea if you don't
take me as your one day girl friend.
Is there... Is there a girl?
White dress?
-Ya
Yes, she is there.
One minute?
-Yes.
Are there two old
peoples in the table?
Yaa they are having biscuits.
They are there, right?
-Yes
You'll die if you jump.
I'm just fictitiuos.
How'll I die?
No. You are in real.
I know it.
Really? How did you know?
The two old people
sitting there told me.
Who?
No one is there.
Rockstar Gautam interestingly
looking at rubbish.
What Sir? Are you imagining
something in here?
He is in Real.
He is right somewhere here?
-Who?
Oh! The one you
killed in Hyderbad?
He too came GOA along with you?
I've seen him throwing this CAN.
This is enough to prove him real.
Excuse me.
This one is also real.
This is GOA Sir. Its very
common to have such CAN.
This CAN might be common
but he's not common.
He has Mongolian face
with pony tail hair.
He is apprearing in same pony
tail hair since my childhood.
Thats not his hair style
but Mongolian cutom.
Russian Mafia.
No need to search
him all around.
Just GOA is enough to find him.
Instead of thinking him and wasting
time, you can give your interview???
One day girl friend?
Interview?
One day girl friend?
Interview?
One day girl friend...
Subtitles by your
That means "How am I?"
in Mongolian language.
Sit down.
Whenever you find others,
"How are you?" is asked.
But I ask "How am I?"
How am I?
Same?
Do I look exactly
as you imagined?
Who am I?
Funny.
Instead of asking who am I,
you asking me who are you?
You too do joke.
I've seen my killing
episode in TV.
The anger in your eyes...
Thank God...
I was not there, so its ok.
If not, you've killed me so brutely.
Thinking that too makes
me so scared.
Who are my parents?
Why do you killed them?
I thought of killing you
before you aks me that.
The  dash in the
beach...the boat...
These are not the accidents.
These are my plans to kill you.
But... missed.
As like your childhood.
This time without any plans
Get ready to die from my hands...
Hello Rockstar...
Are you here?
I'm searching you all over the market.
Are you angry with me coz
I sang song in your tune.
What a timing your
girl friend has?
That time she appread
while you killing me.
Now she is coming while
I'm going to kill you.
Is she recording this too?
No... no no no...
I don't like to
have proof system.
I don't leave any proofs.
What? Will you kill me?
Will you kill me if I want to be
your girl friend for one day?
Its me... Looking good
scene around I came here.
How many hours does it works?
One bottle cap works for an
hour and full for whole day.
Despite Tsunami too, the one
drinking this, will not woke.
The relations value
between you and me...
Sorry Sir.
They escaped.
Ok.
Where will they go?
Maximum there are 10 Island.
Go and search.
Gautam...
How come we here?
What happened to the yatch?
Gautam
What happened to your yatch?
Somebody put fire in the yatch.
They again attacked us.
We excaped from the boat.
Due to fire in that
too, we came here.
Who saw the men putting
fire in the yatch?
Its me.
Who chase them?
-Its me.
Who cut the rope?
That too is you.
Do I tell you what happened?
You imagined someone
putting fire in the yatch.
You cut the rope and
made me fly in the air.
After that you imagined
someone chasing us.
At last, you imagined
boat to be in fire and came here.
Mr. Gautam. We didn't came here
because somebody attacked us
We are here coz you
imagined that.
What I'm saying is true.
What you are saying is not real.
And me too is not real.
Sameera.
Sameera is not here. You are
just imagining her. Thats all.
Don't you know the
meaning of privacy?
Where ever you go
and disturb us.
You arrived so soon.
Actually I didn't
expect you to come.
Its me shouting for you.
Won't you talk with me?
Will you just stay right here?
That boat too left.
Passing boats will
not care about us.
Fishing boats will
be here tomorrow.
Just stay one day
in this Island.
You and me.
I seems your "one day girl friend"
wish will be fulfilled today.
Seriously. Will you accept me
as your one day girl friend?
But you are fictitious, right?
Who said that?
-You...yourself
No..No.. I'm in real.
Sit down.
Stand up.
Run in the water.
That it. Whatever I'm imagining,
you are doing the same.
You are fictitious.
No.. no..no.. I'm just doing
what you're saying me to do.
Exactly I thought of
saying that and you did.
No...
If you want then say again.
I'll prove me as real.
Kiss me.
Hug me.
You are not doing as I said.
That means I'm imagining
that interview girl.
One day girl friend will've
done whatever I said.
Tightly.
I thought that looking at
the romantic scene. Sorry.
I'm imagining you.
I'm fictitious.
I accept that.
Will you accept me as
your one day girl friend?
I'm so happy.
I didn't thought you will
express your love to me.
You wantonly played
with me, right?
You know I'm in real, right?
I know you are real.
But I had to know interview
girl as fictitious, right?
Then what should we do?
Then I've to take your interview.
It that so? Ok ok. Rockstar
interviewing a jorunalist.
Amazing. Nice TRP item. come on.
What's your name?
You know that.
Its interview.
Sameera.
What do you do?
-I'm a journalist.
What's your covered best news?
Best news... to record
your murder scene.
Sorry. Recording
Gautam murder news.
I got famous from that.
I lost my name.
Do Gautam has the past?
-No. He's just presumming it.
What else did he assume?
Many things. He is imagining
the interview girl too.
That means interview girl is not real?
-Yeah
This camera says that interview
girl is not fictitious.
How much are they giving you?
For telecasting this news.
You are the first person
so close to my life.
I thought you loved me?
It would've been good
if your love was true.
Don't play with me onwards.
I have my past and
that's the reality.
No one can make it
fasify. You too can't.
You acted loving me. But don't
act like being in pain.
It would've been good if
you're really fictitious.
I'm the first person to
believe you having your past.
I searched for your past.
Nearly 20 years back, Inspector Maule
joined that boy here.
I too don't remember properly
I found alone him in the forest.
He used to cry saying his
parents were murdered.
After inquiring, nothing like that.
He is first boy to run away
from our orpanage home.
Thats why I remembered him.
But I didn't any proof.
Why I did this all, you know?
He strongly believes
that he has his past.
He just keep on imagining
only those three. Not others.
We can't do anything about that.
Then what can we do doctor?
I'll tell you one
If we can prove that he
imagine other people too then
we can treat him.
But thats impossible.
Thats impossible.
No Doctor...
Its possible.
Thats why I acted as two people.
Whatever happened between us, if that
were real then how happy would I've been
But in proving your reality
my love, became a lie.
Which I couldn't bear.
So, its a recored
failure love story.
Whatever happened between us in real,
turned to be fictional would've been good
Sorry Gautam.
Good Bye.
Sameera...
Is this real?
-What happened?
Is this in real or not?
-Yes Gautam. So what?
That means attack too is real.
Gautam. Listen to me?
You don't have any past.
You are just presumming that.
As long as you don't believe that,
attacks on you keep on happening.
That is what I'm saying too.
That attack was not
for me but for you.
They are trying to kill you.
-So you are imagining like that now.
Car accident, boat
accident, yatch attack...
That too happened when
you where there...
What they want is you not me.
Why do they want to kill me?
I don't have any enemy.
They woul've killed
me if they wanted to.
They wouldn't have left me.
They are coming for you Sameera.
Its not safe to stay here.
Come.
You know what?
Real or Fictitious,
thats not your problem.
Untrust.
You'll have believed
me, if you'd loved me.
I Love You.
I Love You.
Enough?
Do you believe me now?
I believe you Gautam.
I Love You too.
Two minutes...
I'll just change
my dress and come.
Subtitles by Mr.
What are you doing?
They are my friends.
Rahul, are you ok?
Happy Birthday Sameera.
We came to give you surprise
but Gautam gave us surprise.
I didn't thought they
were your friends.
I thought they were
there to attack you.
Sorry Sameera.
This won't repeat again.
Sameera...
I'm saying Sorry.
Happy Birthday Sammera.
Please Gautam leave me.
Just go away from here.
What you said is

Nobody attacked you.
All were my imaginations.
Sameera...
I'll change...Sameera.
Sameera... I'll change.
Who cares if you change or not?
Whats the relationship between us?
Sameera I Love You.
Is this the reality?
Do you know what you are saying real?
Sameera... that is...
I can't trust you Gautam.
You won't change.
Stop Sameera.
What should I say to
make you trust me?
How can I make you believe me?
Fine. Your past fictitious.
You don't have your parents.
All is that your imagination.
Do you accept that?
I accept that Sameera.
I don't have my past nor
do I've my parents.
If I don't come out now
from this falsity then
I can't ever come out from this.
In the sorrow of having no one,
I pressumed them to be killed.
In the fear of losing you, I'm pressuming
someone trying to attack you right now too...
That all is fictional.
All is just created only by me.
Gautam...
Right now too, I'm imagining someone
trying to stab knife in your neck Sameera.
Look I'm not reacting anymore.
They are staring at me Sameera.
There are other people
behind him too Sameera.
I'm scared they might kill you.
Look I'm not doing anything.
Believe me.
Look they are
beating me Sameera.
Yet I'm not doing anything.
Whether its reality or not...
I can't bear if anything
happens to you Sameera.
Sorry Gautam...
Who are you?
Why are you trying
to kill Sameera?
Why are you trying to kill her?
Tell me.
Tell me.

effects of seeds from A-Jeevan's company
Actually my friends who proved Hydrogen
Cyanide in that seeds is a GOA's best INGOs active member.
Recently when I called him when I

After that, it came to news that
he died in some boat accident.
But before his death,
he'd called me
Saying A-Jeevan cheif called him
to discuss about this matter.
I'm the only one person to
know that he went there.
When he died the day after
calling me, I got the doubt
and inquired about the A-Jeevan chief.
Correctly after that attacks
are happening on me.
That means that's not
an accident Sir.
It was a pre-plan murder Sir.
Fearing about the truth coming
out, he too is trying to kill me.
His name is Antonio Rosarios.
Its his photo Sir.
Have a look.
Did anyone come with you?
Gautam Sir. He is waiting
in the lobby outside.
Do Gautam know this?

I lied him saying that this is due to
the investigate that I did in the old city

don't have any past.
My past is falsity means you
too is not real, right?
Shhhh... don't talk.
Stay calm.
I'll believe you to
be real if you talk.
I only talk.
But Sameera don't like talking
with you in my imagination.
She has started believing
me thinking I'm changing.
For her to believe that I
totally has changed then
I've to stop pressuming you.
I've to kill you.
Doctor gave me this tablets.
Said you'll disappear
if I take this.
that I won't see you again.
But I feel pain if you dissappear.
You are here means my
parents too were there.

It would've been good
if you were real.
But you are not...
Just die.

Doctor says, if take this tablets, you'll disapper.
What I say is, before taking this tablets,
I want to kill you by this bullets.
Revenge Story, Right? It would
get the commercial ending.
What do you say?
Why are you taking the breath?
You are not alive coz you are breathing.

Do you want to say anything?
Its ok, you can tell. I'm
giving you the permission.
Tell me.

May be he has no
connection with your past.
Those three killed my parents.
He is one of them.
I know it.
How can you say that?
We don't have any proofs.

Yes Gautam. I sent
them to talk with you.
They are not the goons, they
are my company's cab drivers.
After seeing your
story in the TV
I understood you looking
me too as villian.
Thats why I sent them to
tell the truths about you.
If you'd wanted that then
you'd had directly come.
I didn't came thinking
you'd react like this.
One who wasn't there, you
killed imagining him.
If I had come, thinking reality
you might have killed me.
Anyway I did come
for you next day.
But you left thinking
me as fictitious.

You're lucky madam. You

Sir's check like an apple.
If you want to live then you've to
live like a star like our Sir, madam.
Madam, its all coz of his
parents good deeds.
They put guitar in our Sir's hand.

That's why Dudu became
Rockstar and I ended as Rodstar.
I just play with stiring.
Hey Dad Mangal Singh,

I don't know the music
but too I'll sing.
This what I like doing

I'm scared Gautam.
I'm afraid if anything
may happens to you.
Lets go away from here. Please Gautam.
Please.
They did right thing by
trying to kill me, Sameera.
It's now confirmed that
the third one is here.
Till now I kept on
searching them.
But now they are searching for me.
We both are standing in
the same way.
Face to face.
I'll get him Sameera.
Dudu. I called Michael
but is switched off.
No any number is working Dudu.
Whats the relation
between you and Michael?
I don't have any
connection with him Dudu.
He is just my regular cutomer.
Keep calling only for the cab.
Do you know where is he?
He is out of my connection.
I don't know where he went.
That means do he have
connection with the attack?
Only Michael know
that we came here.
He didn't come to the airport.
Switched off the mobile after the attack.
That means he and that third
guy has the connections.
First we've to find Michael.
I don't know where he is Dudu.
But I know where he goes.

My revenge is finished.
Now remaining is yours revenge.
But one thing before killing.
Why did you kill Michael?
-Who is Michael, Boss?
That means you
didn't kill Michael?
Why do I kill him?
That means you

London is my dream Sir.

Ok Sir.
Kill him too.
Don't kill him Sir.

You need Visa.
You need Vis, right?
He wants Visa, right?
Who told you that I
killed your father?
That day in the concert, my
father met his old friend.
You are always my boss.
Come Sir.
He too was in the car when
you followed my father.
I started a new bussiness.
He saw you creating
trouble with my father.
You were with other two.
He said that you killed my father.
Why you killed them?
I'm not the one who killed your father.
your father's old friend.
Due to the SINTO-1 company,
sides effects are seen
Land is polluting and many are dying.
This is not the problem.
Climate temperature
is increasing.
Fertile lands are
turning to infertile.
In many countries there
is the scarcity of foods.
World is going to face a
big food crisis problems.
Golden rice with C4 mechanism.
whatever the climate,
it can grow massively.
The property that can
fullfill the world's need.
That property is
invented by SINTO-1.
From now onwards, every types of
countries
have to beg before
SINTO-1 for the food.
Sir, Gautam knew the truth.
He can't kill me nither do I.
My Golden rice is with him
and I've his past with me.
We need eachother.
Your father and I was
Co-Scientists in same company.
Not only that but
a good friends.
Your father always used to think about
the welfare of peoples and farmers
He wanted to do
something for them.
After that we started this
SINTO-1 seeds hybrid company.
But your father involved in preparing
golden seed in a traditional way.
which I said impossible.
Suddenly he came to the
lab to test the seeds.
I got surprised
seeing the results.
That was Golden Rice.
Cores and cores of money was invested in the project
whose result was in you father's hand.
I said him to give
it for the company.
He said no and wanted
to give people freely.
For that he went to the Goa
International Rice Convention.
I thought of getting seeds
killing your father.
Joining Antonio there,
I killed your parents.
After that I found, the seeds your
father gave me was of no use.
There he put the
terminator gene.
We got the information that
he hided seeds somewhere
and put its locations secretly in the Rubik's cube from the cab driver.
your father wants you to
have that Rubik's means
you know about finding the clue.
I sent my people behind you.
But you were too clever.
You ran from there.
The magic that father hided 20
years back, now son has got that.
I got doubt when the bullet that killed
Michael didn't wanted to kill me
the one whom I'm searching is
expecting something from me.
At that time I got the
clue and went to bank.
In bank, I found the box
that my father hided.
But there was no
seed in the box.
Whats that there is
no seed in the box?
There must be seed.
There should also be the
details of my father in your story.
I know that you are eagarly waiting
to know about your parents.
Your father's name is Raghu Ram.
This is not original
golden rice.
My father name is
also not Raghu Ram.
How can you say that?
You won't kill me untill and unless I
say the truths about your parents.
That means that
file is not real.
Tell me where is seed?
I'll tell truths
about your parents.
Finally what I understood is
you won't tell me until
I give you the seed.
I won't give you seed until
you tell me about my parents.
The other truth that
you and I know is
As soon as I give you
seed, you'll kill me.
I too will kill you as soon
as you tell me the truths.
Never Ending Process.
There is only one
solution for this
one of us has to compromise.
I'll compromise.
I don't need my past.
Means?
-I'll kill you.
Gautam
I'm the only one to know
about your parents.
If you kill me then there
won't be your any past.
If I don't kill you then my
fathers wish will not come true.
Till now I thought knowing
my parents was my life
Now I decided to fulfill my
fathers wish is correct for me.
Your father's name
is Krishna Murthy.
He is a Scientist
from Philipines.
Ravindra.
Your father's name is Ravindra.
He used to work in Texas.

I'l listen whatever
the stories you tell.
Coz in there is my parents

You'd killed him in every story.
The end of story is always same
that I'll kill you.
