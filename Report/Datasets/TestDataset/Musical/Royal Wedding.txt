My Royal day
can be a Royal bore.
It leaves me colder
than a basement floor.
The only moment I keep waiting for,
is when the day will be through.
I never notice if it's dark or clear.
What people say to me I hardly hear.
The passing hours are an endless year
until at last I'm alone with you.
Every night at seven you walk in
as fresh as clover
and I begin to sigh all over again.
Every night at seven
you come by like May returning
and me, o my
I start in yearning again.
You seem to bring
far away spring near me.
I'm always in full bloom
when you're in the room.
For every night at seven,
every time the same thing happens.
I fall once again in love
but only with you.
Every night at seven,
every time the same thing happens.
I fall once again in love,
but only with you.
May I say your performance
was a bit ragged.
You were so slow going around
the throne I almost caught you.
Well the audience
seemed to like it.
It's so hot in New York in the summer.
I'm glad we're closing tomorrow night.
I wonder what happened
to the air conditioning.
Mr. Hiller probably turned it off
to save money.
Oh, would you blot my face too.
Up here it's dripping.
Who's Mr. Hiller?
The house manager.
You ought to know that.
You've been playing his theatre
for the past year and a half.
Is that that evil little man
who comes around and pinches?
That's your department
sister dear.
All I can say is let Mr. Hiller
keep his air conditioning.
He can't take it with him,
and where's he's going, he'll need it.
Boy, it's hot!
If I ever play a king again,
I'll be one of those Asiatic boys
who just wears
earrings and a sheet.
Hey! What's your hurry?
Pete.
Hi Ellen honey.
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.
You know my brother Tom,
don't you?
No I don't believe
I've had the pleasure.
How are you?
I'm fine Sir,
and thank you for asking.
I'll be out in five. Oh, my peach
you look so nice and cool.
Make yourself at home.
Sit down, anywhere.
- Oh, how was it sir?
- Hot.
Oh, Um your agent stopped
by to see you sir.
Irving. What brought him out
this clammy night?
He didn't say.
He just told me to tell you
it was imperative that you and
Miss Ellen meet him at McGuffie's bar,
next door, right after the performance.
Oh Ellen.
Yeah.
Irving wants us to meet him
at Mcguffies.
Okay. How do you like Pete?
Isn't he cute. He's from the south.
Why Ellen honey,
I never would have guessed it.
He owns miles and miles
of tobacco land in Virginia.
And you ought to hear him chant. I met
him two days ago at Hilda's Barn sales.
And I'm simply mad about him.
Is that all.
That's all.
Roger.
Miss Ellen seems quite taken.
Doesn't she?
This will probably be one of those long
affairs that drags on a whole evening.
News overseas concerns the
Royal Wedding in London.
The British capital is already
festive and happy
in anticipation of the wedding,
which is still several weeks off.
- Towel.
- Ssh. Please Sir.
As for the Princess,
the most guarded secret in England
since radar is her wedding gown.
The Princess herself will see it
for the first time this weekend.
- Just give me...
- Please Sir.
Other news. In Miami Florida,
a new tropical hurricane
seems to be approaching.
Can I talk now?
Yes Sir, You know Mr Bowen
I danced in Trafalgar Square
the day her grandfather
was married.
Oh.
I'd give anything to be there again
this fall, wouldn't you?
Yes. I like weddings provided,
of course, they're not mine.
Oh, marriages
are very healthy sir.
They say married men live
much longer that bachelors.
If that's true, they're only trying
to outlive their wives
so they can be bachelors again.
Haven't you ever thought
of getting married Sir?
Once,
as a matter of fact I did.
The young lady changed
her mind at the last moment.
I've been indebted to her
ever since.
Goodnight Chesley.
Gee, I wonder what Irving wants?
I hope it' s something that...
My gosh what a muscle,
It's like cement.
Oh, it's nothing.
All us tobacco men get kinda strong.
- What from?
- Lifting money.
Come now
it wasn't that good.
Good night Eddie.
Goodnight.
Goodnight Eddie.
Goodnight.
He's the only stage door man
I know that isn't called pop.
Hello Bill.
Hi Irv.
I couldn't wait for you
backstage tonight.
What's it with that heat? Who needs it?
So how was the show?
- The first act was a little...
- Dollboat, how are you baby?
Fine. How are you?
- Oh, you look so sweet tonight.
- I do, don't I?
Okay. Come on, order.
I got new, big news.
Can I present
Pete Cumberley?
How do you do, Mr. Cumberley.
It's a great pleasure.
Thank you Sir.
That's very nice.
- Who's this square?
- A friend.
- A Tom Collins please.
- Nothing for me, thanks.
Hit me with a rye.
Shall I give it to you?
What is it?
This'll kill you. My brother Edgar
called tonight from England.
He's the boss of our London
Office, been there for years.
The Mayfair Theatre people
want your whole show for London.
No!
But quick they want you there
during the wedding season.
- England during the wedding.
- I like that.
Oh, Tommy.
Ellen honey, does this mean
you'll be leaving me?
Yes Pete. Isn't it wonderful?
When do we open?
As soon as possible. Of course you
gotta rehearse the English cast first.
Hit me son.
What about transportation?
There's some French boat
leaving a week from next Monday.
Which one?
Who knows what's the name,
it's in French.
Don't worry I'll get you on it.
Ellen, this means we'll be
saying good-bye in ten days.
Oh yes Pete I'm so happy.
- Ellen.
- Oh, hello Dick.
I was waiting for you backstage.
That's why I'm late. I'm sorry.
- Ellen, who is this fella?
- Finish your drink Pete.
Did you hear the good news?
We're going to England
and we'll be there during the wedding!
What are you doing here, Sir?
- What do you mean? Who's he?
- A friend.
What are you doing here Sir?
I demand an answer.
Go peddle your papers!
When do you leave?
- That's an insult.
- What's an insult?
This is terribly embarrassing.
I forgot all about Dick.
I hope they don't hit each other.
We ought to start packing.
I have to buy all my new clothes
before I go.
You'll have time.
I'll send the rest of the Company
the week after you leave.
- I wonder what they'll be wearing?
- I don't know.
- Pay the man, will you?
- Sure. How much do we owe you?
- May I?
- Yes you may.
And keep the change.
I have a little business to take care of,
I'll meet you on deck.
Okay sister dear.
Hello Billy.
This is good-bye.
Thanks for coming down
to see me off.
It's hard saying good-bye
after all we've been to each other.
I know,
it's been a lovely three days.
But I'll be back soon.
Oh, dear.
I must go now.
May I walk you
up the gangplank?
Well, I'd rather you wouldn't,
you understand.
No.
Well, it's just better that way
Write to me Billy.
I will. Goodbye Ellen.
I'll miss you very much Linda.
Knowing you
these past few weeks
has been one of the most exciting
things that's ever happened to me.
To me too, John.
Pete!
Ellen honey.
I thought I went to the wrong gate.
We haven't much time.
Really?
And I have so much to say.
- What?
- Well, you gonna be away.
Yes I know Pete, but what?
Suddenly knowing
you're gonna be away
makes me realise
my feelings for you.
So I thought I'd.
I mean, Ellen honey.
Visitors ashore please!
Oh dear Pete,
you'll have to go now.
But Ellen honey.
Better hurry. Write me
what you had to say, huh? Bye.
Barbara,
knowing you these past few weeks
has been one of the most exciting
things that's ever happened to me.
I'll miss you John.
- Good-bye baby.
- Goodbye Irv.
I know you'll be a smash. Now if you
want anything you ask my brother Edgar.
He's gonna meet you
at the hotel.
- So long Irv.
- Bye.
So long Ellen. So long.
Bye honey!
See you soon.
So long, see ya!
Hey. Who are you
waiving up there?
My girl, right there, see.
That's my girl.
Oh, don't give me that.
That's my girl.
I bet against five
on Dixie boy.
What a beautiful,
beautiful day.
Isn't it wonderful.
We don't know a soul on the boat,
and we can have fun
together for a change.
Yeah.
- Good day.
- Good day.
I don't know him, Tom.
Honest I don't. I want to write a letter.
Okay baby.
Don't forget
we've got to rehearse.
What time should
I meet you?
Two o'clock sharp,
in the gym.
- I won't keep you long.
- I'll be there don't worry.
- Now don't be late.
- Okay.
- Good day.
- Good day.
There's carbon paper in the middle
drawer, if you want to make duplicates.
I'm not writing a letter,
I was just doodling,
waiting for an opportunity
to introduce myself.
My name is Brindale. Lord
John Brindale, and what's yours?
Bowen.
Duchess Agatha Bowen.
Oh, no really. What is it?
Oh, let's see now.
E. B. E, is that Ethel?
Wait a minute.
Bowen, why of course -
you're Ellen Bowen aren't you?
You're doing fine.
It's very stupid of me,
I should have known.
I only saw your show a few
weeks ago. Please forgive me.
Oh, that's alright,
I know you have a lot on your mind.
Oh, I can explain those two little
episodes that you witnessed yesterday.
- Oh, you can?
- Yes.
Then go ahead.
Well, you see,
they're both terribly nice girls,
and they're so fond of me, that I couldn't
bear depriving either one of them.
You know how it is.
To be kind to people,
one has to be a very good liar.
Tell me,
why were you following me?
Following you?
I was doing no such thing.
I was only saying goodbye
to a couple of...
- The same?
- Yeah.
Does this sort of thing
happen to you very often?
Oh, all the time.
And you?
Constantly.
I guess we're both
two kind people.
I have to get a stamp.
Do you live in New York?
No,
I've been there on business,
but I'm just going home
for the wedding.
- The Royal Wedding?
- Yeah.
You're going to the wedding?
Well
I'm escorting someone, yes.
You really are
a Lord aren't you?
I'm afraid so.
My, my!
Haven't you met anyone
who held a title before?
Only Joe Louis.
- I'm very glad you're Ellen Bowen.
- Why?
It means that the chap you're with
is your brother, not your husband.
Do you know
what I did last night?
No, what?
I surveyed this whole boat,
and I discovered
that you were the most
attractive girl on board.
Well, thank you.
And I kept thinking that,
what a pity she's married,
because that's going
to make things terribly awkward.
But it isn't going to be
awkward at all now.
- Thanks for the use of the hall, purser.
- Not at all.
If you see my sister on deck,
tell her I'm waiting for her please.
I will.
- I like your boat.
- Thank you Monsieur.
Monsieur Bowen.
I have a favour to ask.
On every crossing, we have a gala
benefit for the disabled seamen.
I was wondering if you and your sister
would dance for us on that night.
Oh, we'd love to. Just tell us when.
One number
would be sufficient.
No trouble at all.
I know it's an imposition to ask
you two. But I would feel so...
We'd love to.
Don't worry we'll do it.
There's a fella that won't take yes
for an answer.
Oh, fine. Thanks for showing up
for rehearsals.
Oh... Er John, this is my brother Tom.
Tom this is John.
- How do you do?
- Glad to know you.
I just picked up John
in the writing room.
- So I gather.
- He's a real Lord.
Oh, it's nothing at all.
- Miss Bowen.
- Yes.
- A cable.
- Oh, thank you. Excuse me please.
Oh, Tom. That was from Pete.
He says he's very blue
except for his eye which is black.
Let's forget Pete for this trip, shall we?
Excuse us.
Oh dear. It looks a little dim
out there, doesn't it?
Yeah.
Monsieur Bowen,
I'm wondering if you and your sister
would dance right away
instead of waiting until 10:30.
We're a little afraid
of the weather.
- You mean it might be a little rocky?
- Yes.
That won't bother us,
we can handle it.
- Thank you, Monsieur.
- Any time you say.
I'd better change my dress.
Open your eyes,
there's a sapphire sky above us.
High above us.
Made for you.
When you open your eyes.
Open your eyes,
there's a carpet of jade around us.
Laid around us.
All for you.
When you open your eyes.
Let me show you the sight.
Take you on a tour of this great,
new fabulous world.
We own. We alone.
So open you eyes
and you'll see how this momentary,
ordinary night can seem.
More unreal than a dream.
We can handle it alright.
What do we do now?
- Keep your balance.
- Oh, sure.
So sorry.
- Oh, it's nothing.
- Pardon us.
What?
- Isn't it wonderful Tommy?
- It sure is.
Hello. Yes. Oh, sure. Yes, yes.
Do come on up.
Room two hundred & eleven,
twelve and fourteen. OK.
Who was that?
Edgar Klinger, Irving's brother,
he's coming up.
I'm so happy Tommy.
I wonder what the Princess
is doing this morning?
Why don't you call her
and ask her?
I know what I'd be doing
a month before my wedding.
Probably trying to figure
a way to get out of it.
Do you really think so?
You know you would,
and so would I.
How do you do?
I'm Edgar Klinger.
Oh, we didn't know...
- That Irving and I were twins.
- No, we didn't.
I must say.
He should have told you, you know.
After all this is a pretty box of pickles.
May I come in?
Of course, I'm sorry.
How do you do?
So happy to meet you
at long last.
- My, it's amazing.
- It is rather, isn't it?
I do hope the rooms
are satisfactory.
Oh, they're fine.
It's a miracle you could get them.
Yes quite. The wedding
has backed things up a bit.
But, er, then there are ways.
How's everything
in the theatre?
Oh, seems to be humming.
The dancers are coming to audition
this afternoon. The singers tomorrow.
Excuse me please.
Hello. Oh, hello Johnny,
how are you?
Ellen's boat romance. John Brindale.
You know him?
Know the family, very old.
They do say that young John's
a bit of a chaser.
Didn't have to chase very hard
after Ellen. She stood still and waited.
This afternoon, no they're
auditioning all day. Just a minute.
Tom you don't need me
this afternoon, do you?
John wants me to drive down
and see his old country house with him.
I suppose it's alright.
But I thought you'd want to come
and see who you're working with.
Oh, I never notice
anyone but you.
- John.
- I want you home for dinner.
And no dates at night
until after we open.
You come strolling in at four in the
morning, and be tired out next day.
Yes Poppa.
It's all set.
What time will you pick me up?
Ok. I'll be ready.
Bye Johnny.
Shall we?
Yeah. I'll see you at seven
and be back.
- Oh, I will. I will.
- Cheerio.
Goodbye Edgar.
Oh, and if there's anything
you need, do call.
Thank you.
After you...
Tell me old boy, how are things
in the Colonies, these day?
Oh, fine, fine.
These English clothes
are terrific.
Frankly amusing tie.
Yeah.
Got a match?
Thanks. I hear that shaving lotion's
great stuff, do you ever use it?
Oh, every day.
Sorry. I thought you were him.
How odd. Thank you.
I must get back to the office. You know
where the theatre is, don't you?
Sure.
Well I'll see you later.
Cheerio.
Okay.
Well hello again.
I wish
you'd stop following me.
Following you?
I'm not a bit flattered.
Mr. Bowen. I'm Charles Gordon
your stage manager.
Oh, it's nice to see you.
- Everything's ready Sir.
- Oh good.
See that girl in the green dress,
near the end changing her shoes.
Yes Sir.
Let's begin with her. They can each
show me a few steps.
Very good Sir.
- You name please?
- Anne Ashmond.
Thank you.
Will you begin please?
Why, yes.
Miss Anne Ashman.
Will you try a few steps
with me please?
Oh, dear.
Can't you dance
with a partner?
I could
until a moment ago.
Well try. We'll take
something easy to start.
May I have a pick-up please?
You should have seen the expression
on your face, when you saw me.
- How did I look?
- As if I were a dentist.
- You dance very well.
- Thank you.
- I think you'll do fine.
- Will I really?
Sure.
It's very nice of you not to hold
what happened against me.
I do a little bit.
Well, what can I do?
You can have dinner
with me some night.
- Well, I should love to.
- How about tonight?
Well, I don't really know.
She'll do fine. Pick you up at eight.
Thank you. Who's next?
Is it much further?
No, we're almost there
My, you look pretty.
I know. What do you have
to do at the house?
Get the wedding present.
We sold almost everything at auction,
except for one set of china plates.
I was supposed to get those
when I got married.
Since there's little chance of that,
we decided to hand them
to the Prince & Princess.
- Why is there precious little chance?
- Oh, I don't know.
You have
to enjoy living with yourself,
before you have the nerve
to ask anyone else to.
Besides, you know how I am.
Oh, here we are.
John, it's beautiful!
Yes it was.
I think they're in here.
What a wonderful floor
to dance on.
How long since
anyone's lived here, John?
About five years. No one
could afford places like this today.
- I imagine you miss it terribly.
- I don't think I do anymore.
I just don't have anything
to replace it with.
- What time do you have to be back?
- Seven sharp.
Oh, I wish you could have
dinner with me.
I don't know when
I'll get another free evening.
There's some sort of party
every night from now on.
Can't you?
I don't know.
You know how Tom is?
Will you try?
- Yes I'll try.
- Good.
Hello.
Hi. Back on time.
How was the afternoon?
It was wonderful.
How were your dancers?
Dancers.
What do you want
to do tonight?
I'm kinda tired Ellie.
I thought I'd just skip dinner and
go straight to bed. Would you mind?
Oh, no. It's a good idea.
That country air really knocks me out.
- Yeah. Sure you don't mind?
- Oh, gosh no.
Matter of fact, I think I'll turn in
right now if it's alright with you.
It's a good idea.
It's been a kind of a rough day.
Yeah.
- Goodnight honey.
- Goodnight Tommy. Sweet dreams.
Taxi, please.
Thank you!
Taxi!
Thank you.
- More coffee?
- Thank you.
Yes. Ellie and I have done
quite a few shows together.
Do you like to dance?
Yes, yes. It's hard work but it's fun.
What made you decide to dance?
Oh, a very silly reason.
How silly?
When I was eleven I fell in love
for the first time with a boy much older.
- Twelve?
- No thirteen.
His name was Alonzo,
and I was so happy
that suddenly
all I wanted to do was dance.
So I figured that if I danced
when I was happy,
I should be happy
if I dance.
Is that silly enough?
I think so.
I felt so good about Alonzo
I used to close my eyes
and pretend I could dance all over
the floor, walls, even the ceilings.
If you ever learn to do that,
I could get you a very good booking.
Want anything else?
No.
Let's go.
- You'd better not take me home.
- Why not?
Well it's a long way,
and besides this is Friday.
Friday I have to stop
and see my Father.
- Oh, I'd like to meet him. Cabby!
- Alright.
- What's the address?
- 150, Mitchell Street.
Cabby, could you take us to
Love to Guvnor. Love to.
- Wait will you please, driver?
- Love to Guvnor, love to.
- That's my father he's the proprietor.
- Oh.
Oh dear. I hope he won't offend you.
He's quite impossible really.
He and my mother
have been separated for three years,
and I have to stop here every Friday
and get her money.
- Why doesn't your mother do it?
- They're not speaking to each other.
So I says to him. McBride,
every time you get four drinks
under that belt o' yours,
you become a bloomin' nuisance.
And what's more,
every time you fall down,
you chip a piece
out of the bar with your chin.
So I says from now on...
Annie!
Well my little girl,
how are you dear?
Hello Jamie. Tom, this is my father.
Father, this Tom Bowen.
Glad to know you, Mr. Ashmond
- Please to meet you Sir.
To the Royal couple.
Bowen eh? I used to know
a Willie Bowen. Good old Willie.
Married a girl we used to know
named Gladys Hawksley.
I don't think
you knew Gladys, Annie.
Very happy they were for years.
Then one night good old Willie
threw her out of the window.
Nobody knows why.
But I always figured
they must have had an argument.
- I don't suppose you'd be any relation?
- Why no.
I don't believe
I have any relations over here.
Over here?
You see I'm from America.
America! America!
Get out of my pub.
Leave the premises.
I'm not on speaking terms
with the United States.
Jamie!
How dare you bring
another yank to my tavern.
Out, do you hear? Out!
What's the matter
with the United States?
Matter! You owe me money, you do.
Where is it?
Look at this, two pounds, ten shillings,
run up by your bloomin' soldiers.
And what did they do? Hopped it.
Walked out without paying.
I'll not serve you a drink Sir.
Now stop it Jamie.
To the Royal Couple.
Well, I can't allow Anglo-American
relations to be threatened like this.
I'd like to square that bill.
- Tom you shouldn't.
- Oh, sure. How much is that?
Two pounds ten, let me see.
There you are Sir.
Now there's a gentleman for you. Not
like the other Yank you're so fond of.
Well, you can just add ten bob
and give it to me for mother.
Has she found out
when we go to the Palace yet?
Or is she keeping it from me?
Three pounds Jamie.
You see we sent a little token to the
Royal Highnesses for the wedding.
According to the papers,
anybody who did are allowed
to see the wedding presents.
It's a nice custom.
Three pounds Jamie.
Oh alright. Here.
What you counting for?
Don't you trust me?
Just like her mother, no faith.
You're five shillings short.
Oh, that's what you might
call a typographical error. Here.
Thank you. We'd better go.
Goodnight Jamie.
Goodnight dearie.
Goodnight pal.
Goodnight buddy.
To the Royal Couple.
Thanks.
Looks like Mother
is still up.
Since she and Jamie separated, she
can never get to sleep till I get home.
Let's walk a minute
and get some nice fresh fog...
Who, er, who's the yank
you're so fond of?
Hal Rayton.
He's my fiancé.
You don't sound
very happy about it.
Oh I am really.
Is it a secret?
No. Oh, this is ridiculous.
He's in Chicago.
Illinois?
He lives there.
- And you live here?
- Yes.
If you keep that arrangement after
you're married, you'll be very happy.
How long since
you've seen him?
About two years.
Two years!
And you're still in love with him.
I've never thought
of not being.
- Do you hear from him very often?
- Every few days as a rule.
Oh?
Actually, I haven't heard from him
for two months now.
But he's probably been busy.
I wrote to him tonight
and told him I was in your show,
and asked him
to call me opening night.
I assume you have some plans
about getting together in the future?
Oh yes.
Are you going over there?
Is he coming over here?
Or are you going to meet
in the middle?
He works in Ogilvies
department store in Chicago.
Oh, well?
Well, as soon as he makes
enough to send for me
or I make enough to go over there,
we're going to be married.
That's fine.
- You... You don't mind do you?
- Mind what?
My getting married.
I should love to go out with you again,
I had an awfully good time.
So did I.
Of course I don't mind.
Actually
I'm kinda glad you're all tied up,
now we can go out and have fun
without any pressure. Can't we?
Yes I guess so.
Goodnight Anne.
Goodnight Tom.
Mr. Irving Klinger.
We're ready with Mr. Edgar Klinger
in London. Go ahead please.
Hello! Hello! Ed this is Irv,
how are you twinsie?
Buzzing old boy.
Simply buzzing.
I got a fast note by airmail
from Tombo this morning.
He says everything is terrif.
Well, that is good news.
Tell me have you heard
from Tom?
No. How are things?
Absolutely superb.
We should have a fantastic opening
night tomorrow night. Fantastic.
What about Ellen? Tom having trouble
keeping her caged up at night?
Oh no. Quite the contrary,
she's been frightfully conscientious.
Goes straight home
from the theatre each night.
Tom's the one
who's been romping about.
Tom? No kidding. What did he do,
catch himself a chick?
No. No. No.
Tom's quite well.
He's taken a fancy to some girl
in the show. Pretty little thing she is too.
Hey Eddie, call me
after the opening, will you?
The light in the window's
gonna be me sitting and waiting.
I will do old boy.
Don't give it a second thought.
By the by,
how's the Mater?
Oh, Mom's fine.
Oh splendid. Do give her a peck
on the cheek for me.
I gotcha.
Dig you tomorrow night.
Pip now.
Pip Now?
Dig you?
What's
all the commotion about?
Some regiment that hasn't
paraded its finery in years.
You can just feel
the excitement growing!
The wedding's
only a week off!
I wonder what the groom
is doing this morning?
Well why don't you
call him and ask him?
Very funny.
Well I thought it was.
What time did you get in
last night, lover boy?
Around eleven I guess. I don't know,
I didn't pay much attention.
Well I did.
It was around two.
My! You're a busy little man
these p. M's, aren't you?
We were just having
a few laughs.
Just a few laughs?
That's all.
Ha.
Come in!
Morning.
Johnny!
What a pleasant surprise?
- How are you?
- Fine.
- Hi John.
- Hello Tom.
I thought this was
a good place to see the parade.
We have a sensational view. Before
I forget: Your ticket for the opening.
Second row
right on the aisle.
Wonderful,
thanks very much.
What time is the parade?
Should pass here any minute.
Ellen, wonderful seeing you again,
how's the show going?
Just fine.
Gee, it's been a long time.
I know four days.
Tomorrow after the
opening, Edgar's giving a party.
You're going with me, OK.
- OK. It'll take a little doing though.
- Why?
There's a huge affair being given,
and I'm supposed to take someone.
But you can get out of it, can't you?
This is my opening night.
Besides, if you don't take me,
nobody will.
I'll get out of it.
You're looking so well these days.
Thank you.
I think about you so much.
I think about you Ellen.
What?
I said I think about you.
It's so different from anything
I ever felt before.
How?
First of all, I'm not interested
in anybody or anything I do.
And that's completely new for me.
Huh?
I said
that's completely new for me.
Ellen, I think
this is getting very serious.
What a parade.
I've never seen anything
like it in my life.
Parade?
Oh it's over.
Wait. I'll tell them
to come back.
Oh ignore him Johnny
I'm so excited
about tomorrow night.
Come on girl we're due
at the theatre, five minutes ago.
Um. In a minute.
Do you realise we've only
Been out at night together,
about three times
since I've been here.
Well.
Come on, come on.
Oh, Just a minute.
What's that your playing Tom?
The song she's supposed be
rehearsing at the theatre, now.
Oh why don't you
rehearse it here?
Oh, that's a good idea.
Is that alright with you Tommy?
Alright.
I wake up and sigh
each morning.
Happy the night's gone by.
I wake up and pray
each morning.
Pray that the day will fly.
And then,
I sit back and smile...
and dream of that day...
when I'll be standing by your side,
my love.
The happiest day of my life.
How my heart will swell
with pride, my love.
The happiest day in a lifetime.
Then, as the last words
are spoken,
the bells
in the steeple will chime.
And I will love you so,
and you will see.
It will be for a lifetime.
Hold it. Hold it, please.
Charlie what time is it?
It's four a.m. Sir.
Oh that's enough. Alright everybody
that will be all for tonight.
I'm sorry to keep you
working so late.
What about
our last two numbers, Tom?
We don't have to rehearse those.
You were fine this afternoon.
I thought so too. The show
looks pretty good, doesn't it?
Not bad. Anne!
Yes?
Don't forget tomorrow night.
The opening, how could I?
Oh yes, do try to make that
we'd love to have you.
I meant afterwards. Edgar's
giving a party, we'll go together.
Oh Tom I can't.
You can't. Why not?
Hal is calling.
Oh that's right. I forgot all about him.
Well it doesn't matter.
I wouldn't bother, except I haven't heard
from him for such a long time now,
and I do have
to talk to him.
Taking the bus home
tonight Anne?
I'll be right with you.
Sorry Tom.
Oh, that's alright.
What time tomorrow Sir?
Three o'clock for the company.
Eleven for Miss Bowen and me.
Eleven?!
What for, Tom?
I want to take those two numbers
we didn't do tonight.
I thought you were
satisfied with them.
There's still
a few rough spots.
What happened to you?
Did you get stood up?
What are you talking about?
My! What a manic
depressive life you lead.
It's going to be a
marvellous party tomorrow night.
I'm going with John.
Who are you taking?
Every night at seven...
Dum dum dum.
Da de di dum
de dum dem.
- Where's the key?
- Well you have it.
I have not. I gave it to you.
I'll suppose I'll have to go
all the way down to the desk and...
See, if you think nice things,
all doors open to you.
Is that
your message for the day?
Flowers! For me.
I wonder who they're from.
Not from me.
Oh, well that I know.
Who?
It's from John.
Can't make the opening.
He can't?
My! What a shame!
I had a feeling this morning
he wouldn't be able to make it,
but he just
didn't know how to tell me.
Isn't that terrible?
Now isn't that terrible?
He's weak
and I just hate weak people.
Yes dear, I know you do.
Up one minute, down the next.
What a manic-depressive life you lead.
Alright, alright,
so we're even.
Who are you going
with tomorrow night?
I don't know.
Why don't you take me?
I think we should go together anyway.
After all, we're the stars of the show.
Yes
I think we should...
Miss Bowen may I escort you to
Klinger's clambake tomorrow night?
Why, I'd be delighted, and
what a surprise you're asking me.
Oh Tommy,
let's be terrific tomorrow night.
- We'll be cosmic.
- Stupendous.
A smash! We hope.
And Ellen, don't forget that's
still the most important thing.
Yes Tommy, I know it is.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
- Oh yeah, yeah.
- You listen to me just once.
- Oh sure.
- I've told you a million times.
You never want
to listen to me.
Yeah. So I said it.
So you heard it. So what?
So this. It's the last time
I'll ever go to a party with you.
Will you put that in writing?
Well you're always
making cracks.
Like what?
Well you're always
humiliating me.
Didn't your mother never
teach you no manners?
I never had no mother,
we was too poor.
Say what's the matter
with you lately?
You used to tell me
you loved me.
You used to treat me like a high-class
dame. Well, usedn't you?
- So I used.
- So there you admit it.
I ain't admitting nothing.
I'll give you one more chance.
Do you love me or don't you?
No I don't.
Quit stalling.
I want a direct answer.
There's one thing about you
I can't understand.
How could you
believe me when I said I love ya?
When you know
I've been a liar all my life.
You've had that reputation
since you was a youth.
You must have been insane
to think I'd tell you the truth.
How could I believe you
when ya said we'd marry?
Well, you know
I'd rather hang than have a wife.
I know I said
I'd make you mine.
Now wouldn't you's know
that I would go for that old line.
How could you believe me
when I said I love you?
When you know
I've been a liar.
You sure have been a liar.
A double-crossing liar.
A double-crossing liar.
All my doggone cheating life.
You said you would
love me long.
So what?
And never would do
me wrong.
Stop bending the suit.
Faithful you'd always be.
Me?
Why baby you must be loony to trust
a lower than low two-timer like me.
You said I'd have everything.
Get her.
A beautiful diamond ring.
Ha. Ha. Ha.
A bungalow by the sea.
A bungalow yet.
You're really naive to ever believe
a full of baloney phony like me.
Why, I should have
just lost my head.
You ain't lost nothing
you never had.
What about the time
you went to Indiana?
I was lying
I was down in Ala-bam.
You said you had some business
you had to complete.
What I was doing
I would be a cad to repeat.
What about the evening's
you was with your mother?
I was romping
with another honey-lamb.
To think you swore
our love was real.
Baby leave us not forget
that I am a heal.
How could I believe you
when you said you loved me?
Why,
you know I've been a liar?
A good for nothing liar.
All my good for nothing life.
You know you've been a liar.
I know I've been a liar.
A double-crossing liar.
A double-crossing liar.
All your good-for-nothing life.
Johnny!
Darling I just had to come.
I just had to.
- Who's that with Ellen?
- Who?
- The chap with the accent.
- Him?
- Yes.
- Brindale.
Aah.
They've become very good friends.
Oh yes.
Don't you think we should
be getting over to Edgar's?
Later Johnny.
Tonight's my night
and tonight I want to be alone with you.
When you didn't show up at the
opening,
I didn't even feel like going on.
How'd you get away from your party?
Oh I just walked out. I couldn't stand
not being with you tonight.
Ellen, Ellen, I think we're in love.
Yes darling I know.
Well what are we going to do about it?
Nothing.
Well we can't go on
in this indefinite state.
Well aren't you happy?
Oh you know I am.
So am I, let's not kill it
with improvement now.
But something might happen.
Like what?
Well, some day, you might look over
my shoulder and see someone else.
Someone else?
Yes.
Too late now to forget your smile.
The way we cling
when we dance awhile.
Too late now to forget
and go on to someone new.
Too late now
to forget your voice.
The way one word
makes my heart rejoice.
Too late now
to imagine myself away from you.
All the things we've done together.
I relive when we're apart.
All the tender fun together
stays on in my heart.
How could I ever close the door
and be the same as I was before.
Darling. No, no I can't anymore.
It's too late now.
- Does Tom know how you feel?
- Oh goodness no.
Do you think he'd mind?
Well, I imagine if he ever found
out he'd get us a booking
some place in South Africa,
just to get me away from you.
Would you forget about me
in South Africa?
Well how could I?
All the things we've done together,
I relive when we're apart.
All the tender fun together
stays on in my heart.
How could I ever close the door?
And be the same as I was before.
Darling no, no I can't anymore.
It's too late now.
Who is it?
It's me Jamie, Tom.
Tommy me boy,
come in.
You all closed up
for the night?
Well, it's after two. But I never
close for you Tommy boy.
Thanks.
The show went well?
Fine! I didn't feel like going home
straight after the party
so I thought I'd stop by
and say hello.
Well you're just in time.
It was announced we go to see
the presents on Monday.
Thanks.
I was just about to try on
me suit for the Palace.
I'll slip into it. You have a look,
then you can tell me what you think?
Sure. Oh by the way,
isn't this Anne's night to visit you?
Yes, she was by
about an hour ago.
Picked up her money
and stole away like a pickpocket.
Did her call come through
from Chicago?
Naw! The bloomin' blighter
never called.
She must be upset?
Well I couldn't say.
I don't know
how Anne feels about anything.
She's not an easy one to get to know.
Very quiet she is, but deep.
At least I hope she is deep,
or else she's wasting
a lot of her time being quiet.
Well, brace yourself.
What do you think?
Do I look like a gentleman?
Jamie,
you look like a banker.
- But do I look like a gentleman?
- It's written all over you.
I got it this afternoon
from Percy Munro.
Last year, when he got pneumonia,
they bought it for him to be buried in.
But he recovered.
My only advice is, if you meet the
Royal Family, I wouldn't bow too low.
Remember this is a wedding,
not a coming out party.
I see what you mean.
I'll watch it.
Are you excited?
Excited. No, I'm just scared.
Nervous and scared.
Why?
It's meeting the old crow again. I haven't
clapped eyes on her in three years.
I know.
It's funny, if it wasn't
for this Royal Wedding,
probably I'd never
cross her path again.
I tell you what.
On Monday, I'll call for you
and take you down to meet her.
I'll give you moral support.
That's nice of you, Tommy.
Unusually nice of you.
You're a good man
you are.
I don't know what Annie's doing waiting
for this knucklehead in Chicago
when she knows a fellow like you
here in town.
That's love Jamie.
What about you?
Do I look like
the settling down kind?
Come on let me out.
Oops. I'll do the bending,
I'm dressed for it.
Thank you Tommy.
Goodnight pal.
Goodnight buddy.
Everywhere that beauty glows you are.
Everywhere an orchid grows
you are.
Everything that's young and gay.
Brighter than a holiday.
Everywhere the angels play
you are.
You're like Paris in April and May.
You're New York on a silvery day.
A Swiss Alp
as the sun grows fainter.
You're Loch Lomond
when autumn is the painter.
You're moonlight on a night in Capri.
And Cape Cod looking out at the sea.
You're all places
that leave me breathless.
And no wonder,
you're all the world to me.
Every night at seven.
Dum de Dem.
Come in!
- Morning.
- Oh hello Edgar.
Absolutely fantastic notices,
everyone.
You could stay on for years.
Have you seen the dailies?
- Rather!
- Oh, we're so thrilled.
There's been an eight-week call
at the libraries.
There's been a what?
At the what?
The libraries, old boy.
That's what we call our ticket brokers.
They want block of seats
eight weeks in advance.
Why didn't you say so?
Oh Tom, did you see the one
where they say we're brilliant?
Where?
Oh Edgar have you called Irving yet?
- I'm off to the office now.
I'll take it in my room.
Edgar, sit down a sec, will you?
I want you to do a favour for me.
At your command old boy.
When you call Irving, ask him
to find out what happened to a boy
who used to work at Ogilvies
Department Store in Chicago.
His name is, er, Hal Rayton.
I've written it all down.
- Oh, right you are.
- Will you do that?
And don't say anything
to anybody about it. Will ya?
It shall be graveyard old boy.
Graveyard.
- Thanks.
- Cheerio!
This is New York.
We're ready in London.
Mr Irving Klinger
is on the line.
Hello. Hello.
Irving there. Edgar here.
- Hey Eddie, so how are things?
- Buzzin' right along.
Smash huh.
So how are the notices?
Wizard old boy,
wizard!
- That bad, huh?
- No. No. No. Wizard, wizard.
Oh!
Wizard.
Yes. Now look, Tom wants you to
follow up on a chap named Hal Rayton.
Hal Rayton, huh.
What does he do a single?
Mr. Rayton is not
in the theatrical profession.
He ain't in the theatre,
so who needs him?
It's a personal matter
of Tom's.
When last heard from,
Mr. Rayton was employed
at Ogilvies department store
in Chicago.
Ogilvies. Dig ya. I'll throw
the hassle to our Chicago branch.
Have the whole mess in your lap
in a fast two days.
No, no,
that won't be necessary.
Just follow up on the Rayton matter
and let us know.
Nadge. I just said:
Pip now!
Oh. Oh yes, er er...
Dig you!
Oh,
there's Jamie for you.
Wouldn't you know he'd be late?
Even to the Palace.
Now take it easy, Mother,
maybe the traffic was heavy.
It's not the traffic, it's Jamie.
Ever since I told him
I don't like to be kept waiting,
he's been keeping me waiting.
You know Mother, there's an old
Spanish proverb which goes:
He who doesn't love the faults
of his loved one doesn't love at all.
That may be well and good
for the Spanish, but I'm English.
- Do you know what I think?
- No dearie.
I think he's excited
about seeing you.
- Do you think so?
- Mm...
- How do I look?
- As elegant as can be.
Tommy,
tell him he's going too fast.
- Driver, could you slow down a little?
- Yes Sir.
What if we stopped to have a quick one,
to the health of the Royal Couple?
Sit back Jamie,
we're not stopping anywhere.
- Tell him to go a little slower.
- He can't. Don't be so nervous.
When you see her, be sure you act
like the gentleman you look like.
I will. But if she says
one word of criticism,
I'll hit her on the head
with this cap.
You'll do nothing of the kind.
Here we are, stop here driver.
Walk the rest of the way.
Go on now, don't lose your nerve.
Get in there. Go on.
Hello Jamie.
Good-day Sarah.
Jamie, your suit's handsome,
handsome.
Thank you. I'm sorry I'm late.
The traffic was heavy today.
I told the cabby
to go as fast as he could.
- Shall we go?
- Allow me.
Jamie don't.
I knew the code. There are some days
when you can do nothing wrong.
- Do you think they'll stay together?
- Sure.
I hope so. For them as well as for me.
I could never have left Mother alone.
Now you can get married
and forget about it.
Yes...
Yeah.
- Good evening.
- Edgar!
I have the information you require
regarding Mr. Rayton.
Oh, what?
Oh it's nothing terribly exciting.
Mr. Rayton still works at Ogilvies.
He's still in the luggage department.
He used to live in Chicago proper,
but not long ago, he and his wife
moved to Evanston.
His wife?
Why yes, he was married
several months ago.
My, my, my!
I say,
who is this chap anyway?
He was engaged to a girl in the show.
I was just finding out about him for her.
- Oh I say that's frightful.
- Yes isn't it.
Well, what are you
so pleased about?
I always smile when I'm
heartbroken. I'd better tell her.
Oh no, not now. Don't you think you
should wait until after the performance?
It would seem kinder.
Maybe you're right.
Edgar, you're a real pal.
I'd stick up for you anytime.
Thanks old chap, that's frightfully
decent of you to say.
Well,
if you'll excuse me.
Oh, I shall be around to pick you up
early tomorrow morning.
- What's tomorrow?
- Why the Royal Wedding.
And I shall take you some place
where you'll see all the pageantry.
Great.
Second act Mr. Bowen!
I left my hat in Haiti.
In some forgotten flat in Haiti.
I couldn't tell you how I got there.
I only know it was so hot there.
She took my hat politely.
And wound her arms
around me tightly.
But I remember
nothing clearly.
Except the flame
when she came near me.
Her eyes had the fire of surrender.
And her touch, it was tender.
And I guess in the moment as that,
you'd forget about your hat.
So if you go to Haiti,
there is a girl I know in Haiti.
If you can find her
you'll adore her.
Just look around
till you find someone
who has a blue grey fedora.
I think of that gorgeous creature
when I'm all alone.
Whenever I do, from down inside
there comes a groan.
That son of a gun in Haiti
has got the prettiest hat I own.
When it's bleak and chilly
and life is flat.
I think of that Haitian dilly.
And think
I'd better go get my hat.
I left my hat in Haiti.
In some forgotten flat in Haiti.
I couldn't tell you how I got there.
I only know
it was so hot there.
But I remember
nothing clearly.
Except the flame
when she came near me.
Her eyes
had the fire of surrender.
And her touch,
it was tender.
And I guess in a moment as that.
You'd forget about your hat.
So if you go to Haiti.
There is a girl I know in Haiti.
If you can find her
you'll adore her.
Just look around and you'll find
someone who has a blue-grey fedora.
Ellen!
Ellen,
got anybody to take you home?
Good.
- Goodnight Mr. Bowen.
- Goodnight.
Anne,
I've something to tell you.
Yes.
I hope you won't think
I've butted in where I shouldn't have.
But Jamie told me
your friend didn't call.
Oh?
I didn't ask. He told me.
I don't quite know why I did it
but I decided to try and find out
what happened to him.
Did you?
Yes I did.
Well?
Anne, he's married.
Married?
I'm sorry.
How wonderful,
how simply wonderful.
Oh Tom, thank you.
Oh it was nothing...
Anne...
I've been worrying myself
to death over him
on account of you
and he's been married all the time.
Isn't it wonderful?
What do you mean
on account of me?
On account of me being in love with you
and you being in love with me.
I'm in love with you?
Well aren't you?
Yeah.
What a mess.
The next thing that happens,
we'll be thinking about getting married.
I'm thinking about it right now.
There you see.
Well,
don't you want to marry me?
Yes I do.
Anne, it isn't you it's marriage.
I'm afraid I couldn't be married
and make a go of it.
I've been living one way too long.
For me it's always been work.
Everything else has just been
a side issue.
It isn't because
I don't want to,
it's just
that I... I don't know if I could change.
Anne, I'll know
I'll be an awful flop as a husband.
Do you understand?
I think I do Tom.
What'll we do?
Perhaps
you'd better take me home.
Tom,
I only disagree with one thing.
What's that?
I think you'll make
a marvellous husband.
You do?
Yes I do Tom.
Hi.
Hi.
You're back early.
It isn't early.
I thought it was.
Well it isn't. It's late.
Is it?
Hm?
I didn't say anything.
Tom,
John wants to marry me.
He does?
That's funny.
It might be to you,
but it's terribly serious to him.
He's very much in love with me.
He says he's found a new faith,
and everything. All on account of me.
How do you feel?
Well, very constructive.
I never thought
I'd see the day
you'd inspire anybody
to do anything but slug it out.
Alright,
go ahead make fun of me.
I'm sorry Ellie. You really are
involved this time, aren't you?
Up to here.
- What are you going to do?
- I don't know.
I was hoping you'd make up my mind
for me, like you usually do.
It sure is funny.
Why do you keep saying that?
When it isn't funny at all.
It's very important.
I know it is.
I only meant it's funny because
Anne wants me to marry her.
She does?
My gosh,
it sure is funny, isn't it?
Why?
I don't know.
It's just funny that's all.
What's so funny about someone
wanting to marry me?
I have
a few good points you know.
Tommy, are you really
in love with her?
Up to here.
I wonder
what would happen
if we just threw over all our principles
and got married anyway.
You'll stay here
in England with John?
Why would I stay here?
You can't go traipsing all over the world
and leave your husband at home.
What kind of a marriage
would that be?
No, I suppose not.
Well, what would you do?
- I'd marry Anne and...
- I mean who would you dance with?
I never thought of that,
I might try Anne, if she wants to,
she loves to dance
and shows a lot of promise.
- Do you really think so?
- Yeah.
I thought she was
a little awkward myself.
So were you
when you started.
I know it but it takes years
to build a good team.
You've always said that.
And there's a lot of excitement
in doing it.
- It just isn't fair Tommy.
- What isn't?
I'm getting the short end
of the stick.
What?
You want me to settle back
and get out of the way,
while you go off with someone
and have all of the fun.
I think
it's rotten of you, Tommy.
I didn't ask you to...
Everything's been so perfect,
we've had a wonderful life together.
We've been very successful. How can
you even consider breaking it up?
And for what,
to get married?
Oh no Tom,
marriage is a tough business.
You know what I've always
thought of marriage.
Responsibilities. Obligations.
A home to take care of.
Maybe children to look after.
Imagine being married
to someone you're dancing with.
If either the marriage
or the dancing doesn't work out
both of them go kabooey.
No, Thomas,
it's a terrible chance to take.
It is, isn't it?
We mustn't do it.
We've slaved too hard
to get where we are.
Why should we give it up?
It does seem foolish,
doesn't it?
We're a team and a darn good one,
we ought to stay that way.
Maybe you're right.
Of course I'm right.
You do see it, don't you Tommy?
Sure I see it. It's you and me
just like it's always been.
I'm sure we're doing the right thing.
Thank you so much for deciding for me.
Forget it.
What a lovely day
for a wedding. Happy are we to say.
It's a lovely day for a wedding.

To see what all the joy's about.
For everywhere
the world is merry and gay.
What a lovely day for a wedding.
Over again we say.
It's a lovely lovely lovely
wedding day.
What a lovely day for a

What a lovely day for a wedding.
Over again we say.
- It's a lovely, lovely wedding.
- A lovely, lovely wedding.
- Lovely.
- Lovely.
- Lovely.
- Lovely.
Wedding day!
- Hello.
- Good morning old chappie.
- Hello Edgar.
- Good morning.
I've come to take you
to the wedding
and what a wedding parade
we shall see.
- Are you ready?
- As ready as I'll ever be.
What's the matter with you two this
morning? You all at sixes and sevens.
Nothing's the matter.
Let's go.
- Tom...
- Ellie I've got to have her. I lose.
So do I.
I want to get married today!
Today?
Yes, before I change my mind.
Do you think we can do it?
Edgar,
we want to get married.
I thought
you two were related.
Oh no, no... And we want
to get married today.
But it takes three weeks.
Three weeks! Anything can happen
in three weeks.
- You can fix it for us Edgar.
- Irving says you can do anything.
I know, but one must have permission
from the Archbishop's office.
After all,
he's busy today.
You've got to swing it
for us Edgar.
I'll try. You two meet me
at the Vicar General's in two hours.
If it's at all possible to get a licence,
you shall be married this afternoon.
Where, where?
Clyde Street Church.
I believe I know the minister there.
This is pretty box of pickles.
I beg your pardon Sir.
- Now what can we do?
- We have to find Anne and John.
In these crowds?
I know what corner she's standing on.
Where's John?
Should be leaving the Abbey
for the reception any minute now.
You'd better find him. Ellen, I'm
going to miss you a lot from now on.
Tommy,
you're a wonderful brother.
Good luck, darling.
Thanks, Tommy.
Excuse me, excuse me.
Will you excuse me.
John!
- Ellen, what's the matter?
- John I want to marry you.
- What?
- I said I want to marry you.
You do?
Yes, meet me at Clyde Street church
at four o'clock.
Right.
What do you think
you're doing miss?
Oh officer,
I love you.
Anne! Anne!
Tom!
- Will you marry me?
- What?
- Will you marry me?
- Yes.
They didn't have to go to all this trouble,
a small wedding would've been alright.
