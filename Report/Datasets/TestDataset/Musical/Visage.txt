Face
- We're looking for Antoine.
- You just missed him.
I'll call him.
His cup is still there.
You know where he went?
He should be in the park.
- He doesn't live far?
- Just above that street.
Antoine, it's Christophe,
the production
manager on Kang's film.
I thought we had
an appointment at the cafe.
We had an appointment at ten...
He's at the dentist.
He thought it was at nine.
Do you know
how long it will take?
You, you, you...
You are so pretty!
And I, and I, and I...
I am so happy!
Look
at the bees making honey
How couldn't I fall in love
with thee?
It is because
you are so pretty!
You bring
joy to my heart!
You are so pretty!
I am so happy, you're so pretty!
I am so happy, you're so pretty!
You, you, you...
You are so pretty!
And I, and I, and I...
I am so happy!
Look
at the bees making honey
How couldn't I fall in love
with thee?
It is because
you are so pretty!
You bring
joy to my heart!
You are so pretty!
I am so happy, you're so pretty!
I am so happy, you're so pretty!
Yes,
come...
Vincent, stop!
Don't you understand?
They are complete idiots...
Hello...
Why was Antoine on the set?.
He wasn't scheduled for today,
couldn't you warn him?
You should have written a call sheet
telling him not to come.
Antoine has to be protected,
don't you get it?
The insurance won't work,
what do I do?
Is he disfigured, is it serious?
Is he suffering?
I'm fed up with your tales!
On top of it I lost a shoe,
that I loved incredibly...
I won't find...
Where am I? In the Tuileries,
in the snow... nothing, no one.
No one answers, just a machine...
I found my shoe!
I found it.
You must speak to him,
you must be by his side.
You must take care of him.
Antoine is a fragile actor.
You must watch him.
You are no longer by my side,
my heart
There is but solitude in my soul,
and if I can see you no more
as God made me love you
to make me suffer more...
You were always my reason to eXist
To adore you was my religion,
and in your kisses I found
the warmth which honored
the love of passion
It's the story of a love as no other
It made me see the good and the bad
and brought light to my life
Only to turn it off later
How dark life is,
without your love, I won't live
Liao...
I want it
to be slightly
translucent.
I want her skin to be translucent.
So the veins are visible.
How shall we do that?.
Let me think...
Take some of her makeup off.
We can't see the skin's teXture.
The skin color will be more natural.
Vincent?
Ask Christophe
to take some makeup off her cheeks.
Can you remove
the makeup from her cheeks.
The eyes too?
What about the eyes?
Yes, the eyes too.
It doesn't look cold enough.
Could I have a hot tea please?
Thanks.
Give it to her later.
I'd like her skin to evoke...
Liao, on the picture, I'd like
her skin to evoke jade.
She is too made up.
The skin still appears warm.
It's not cold enough?
We might have to put ice.
That's better.
I don't understand.
Who disappeared?
How so, disappeared?
From where? To go where?
The mating period?
You're totally mad.
You're telling me
the deer disappeared?
And he is where, in Paris?
Trotting where, he's where?
It's not possible.
So what! The night is falling.
The deer is all alone.
What will he do?
You're all lined up behind him?
It's ridiculous.
We've wasted too much time.
Then send some to get him,
and in the meantime tell Kang
to shoot a scene in...
in the underground.
Then ask him.
And we'll turn it around,
and notwaste any time.
How so, with Antoine?
Everyone's behind the deer,
Kang with Antoine,
and no one on the set?
That's not possible,
then try to get Kang,
try to neutraliZe Antoine,
find the deer,
and stop wasting time.
What's the deer's name?
Then call him! Call him in the night!
You call him "ZiZou"
and he doesn't answer?
Yes.
Well yes. Why not.
It would be eXtraordinary.
I should have brought a book.
Hello.
You too were invited, it's good.
Yes.
And you know... the person?
It's better to trust strangers.
I don't know who organiZed this.
We're eXpecting a lot of people.
Seventeen persons now.
There are no servants either.
They'll come, they'll come.
There's a door there, in the shadow.
There's a dead animal.
Nathalie lost her earring.
I lost an earring.
All right Fanny?
Did you find it?
Avery pretty, small crab.
She's a Cancer,
she's very attached to it.
When the butler comes,
we'll send him under the table.
I went to the end.
It's a funny table, there's no one.
- Are you hungry?
- Pretty much.
We have a huge beast to eat.
If we talk, time will go by.
Shall we drink while waiting?
Well...
just a bit,
thanks.
And me, yes.
Let's toast.
To your loves.
Take it.
Titi is a great director.
Small...
and great bird.
The Lady from Shanghai...
Everyone is gone,
but Titi will stay
till the end.
It's in his character.
PutTiti in front,
in front of the picture.
PutTiti in front.
Flowers from the garden
at dusk are sullen,
but as the day rises
their gloominess dies
It's a trap!
All right?
Too many things here.
It's all gone bad.
Do we keep that?
