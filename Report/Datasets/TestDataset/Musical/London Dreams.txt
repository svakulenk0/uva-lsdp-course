'In the next one minute my
dream wiII be fuIfiIIed.'
'This dream came into existence
along with me.'
I have done some good, some bad..'
'..and some very bad deeds
to achieve this dream.'
'But I don't regret any of it.'
'Show me one person in the worId..'
'..who hasn't done some thing
good, something bad..'
'..or some thing very bad,
to achieve his biggest dream.'
'Even if there is some one..'
'..it doesn't make a
difference to me.'
'Because, my dream wiII be
fuIfiIIed in next 30 seconds.'
'It aII started in Punjab
during my schooI days.'
ChiIdren, one by one telI mew hat
you wish to become when you grow up?
I want to be a piIot.
- I'm a doctor.- I'm a Iawyer.
And you,Arjun?
I want to be Michael Jackson.
Keep quiet.
That means you want to be
a pop star, Arjun.
Have you toId this your father?
'Have you Iost your mind?'
'Remember, no one from this famiIy
has ever been associated with music.'
'IfI ever hear you even humming again..'
'..I'II skin you alive.
Get back to work.'
I didn't ask your friend there.
Teacher, I don't want to grow up onIy.
There are many probIems
in growing up.
'Music is my hobby..
everything forme.'
'And, I wanted to carve
aniche for myseIf.'
Mannu, I want to reach to the top.
Any how.At any cost.
If you want to become a
successfuI pop star go ahead.
What's the probIem?
Father. He'II make me sIave
to death in his restaurant.
Why does your father
hate music so much?
Because of my grandfather.
Father beIieves my grandfather
is the one responsibIe..
..for the sorry state of our famiIy today.
He keeps praying everyday..
..that I for sake my hobby of music.
And, I pray everyday as welI that,
''How can you Iisten to him?''.
'God bestowed me with
the knack for music.'
'He even gave me the taIent to Iearn music.'
'Then, how couId He take
me away from music?'
'How couId He keep me from
achieving my fame in music?'
So Lord, cIear every obstruction
in my path to success.
Stupid, you wish in such a detaiIed pattern
along with the reasons.
Doesn't the Lord get bored of you?
Just watch, Mannu, God wiII sureIy
do something for me.
What is the matter?
'UnknowingIy, I hadwished
for my father's death.'
'God had cIeared aII the
obstructions in my path.'
'In return,
I made apromise to Him.'
'TIII I fuIfiII my dream..'
'..I won't Iet anything distract me.'
UncIe...
Arjun.Arjun.
I wanted to get a piano.
But it was too heavy.
Here, pIay this fIuteand be happy.
Your father hated music, and so do I.
Every member of our famiIy does.
Andwe also have a reason for it.
If you ever pIay it again,
I'II smash it to pieces.
Get that.
Go to sIeep.
Arjun,where are you going?
Arjun. Arjun, Iisten to me.
PoIice, catch that boy.
- Stop.
Arjun, stop.
- Stop.
Arjun.
Listen to me.
You'II Iearn music by practicing.
'Days, months and years.'
I never kept track of them,
Iike normaI peopIe.'
'The onIything I kept track of..'
'..was how much I have Iearned,
and how much I stiII have to.'
'When I feIt my preparations
were good enough
I feIt the urge to audition
Iike every musician.'
'When I didn't achieve anything..'
'..I thought, God has written
my story differentIy.'
'That's why I decided to
take a different path.'

So,what did you do after I Ieft?
You were working hard

You became famous,

Yes. - I want to shinein

One day,the two of us wiII be
shining just Iike that star.
Yes,wewiII.
You fooI, there is onIy onestar..
..and onIy one person who
deserves to shine Iike it.
And that is you my brother.
As a chiId, I wouId always
feeI jealous of you.
But why?
Because, your father wouId run after you
with the musical instrument.
And my father, wouId always
try to keep meaway from it.
But stiII I kept getting
drawn towards music.
Because, I never had any interest
in anything else.
And, even ifI did feeI something..
..I didn't Iet it burden myheart.
Because, I'veaI ready come aIong way..
..but my destination is
stiII now here cIose.
There's a stadium in London.
WembIey.
I want to singthere one day.
And I want every person
that comes there..
..to know my name.
This is the same pIace, because
of which father hated music.
I used to keep asking you
since chiIdhood that
..why did your father
hate music so much?
Why?
Grandfather was a weII-known
Sufi singerin Punjab.
One day,the government
sent him to takepart..
..in a cuIturaI event,
organised at WembIey.
It was his first chance to
sing amongst thousands.
But seeing the huge crowd,
he just couIdn't sing.
When he was given this big chance
his music faiIed him.
He couIdn't sing.
He feIt that he had
Iet down his country.
And committed suicide.
Andthat's why, Mannu,
this triumph at WembIey..
..is veryi mportant to me.
Very important.
Hey serious man, you made mecry.
You made a stone shed tears.
Lord, Iisten to my brother.
Bro, Iisten to me.
Before your this brother
dies of hunger and you have to sing
mourning songs for me..
..Iet's go to the restaurant
and have something to eat.
Two butter chicken,
two cottage cheese curry..
..two meat curry,two roasted chicken,
two bIack IentiIs..
..two fried rice..
Do you want to finish everything here?
This restaurant won't
run out of food soon.
This is Punjab.
Give that free loader some food.
Comes here every day to hog for free.
Listen..
How much do you manage to earn?
Earn?
'How much do I oweaII of you?'
'Me first, you oweme Rs.20000.
Rs.15250.35.'
'Rs.25525.55.- Rs.28325 and
don't forget the 30 paise.'
'Rs.98.45.
Do as I say. SettIe that with your account.'
'Why shouId I do that?.'
'It wiII take me two days to
total the dues you oweme.'
Then I suggest that you come
after two days onIy.'
I earn enough to make my ends
meet, no credits at aII.
I'm enjoying.
But, how many weddings

How do you manage your
house hoId expenses?
House?
'He'II becoming from London..'

Sir, what does music mean to you?
There's music in the
sighing of a reed.
There's music in the
gushing of a riII.
There's music in aII the things.
If men had ears;the Earth is
but an echo of the spheres.
Shakespeare?
Lord Byron. Thanks.
Arjun, how did you deveIop
a Iiking for music?
Who is your inspiration?
I don't know how and when I

Or maybe Iife..actuaIIy..
Arjun is there.
Arjun, I bareIy managed to escape.
There was agirI caIIed CaIista.
She took me home to ceIebrate
happy birthday with me.
But she forgot to teII methatshehas
a huge husband as weII.
Whom did you Iearn music from?
My father..was a music teacher.
My mother said I Iearnt everything
I needed to in her womb.
After I was born, I did nothing
except for having fun.
We'veheard that earIier
you pIayed in aband in India?
Yes, I did. The Raja-Rani Band.
My brother, Arjun,
he brought me here.
Other wise, I wouId best iII in
Punjab, Iying around in somefieId.
Mr. Mennu..
CaII me Menu once more and
I'II incIude you in my menu.
Mr. Mannu, who are your
favourite musicians?
This is nonsense.
They shouId be asking
these questions to you.
What's wrong with him?
What's music to you?
It's my Iife.
I can't breathe without it.
And I can't even sIeep without it.
If it's with you,
Iifeis meaningfuI.
If not, Iifeis meaningIess.
The truth is everything
that seems odd to say..
..sounds wonderfuI to sing.
And that's why, there's music
aII around in the worId.
Jai Hind.
What?.
Did you hear..what I just said?
About music.
About you.
Didn't you remember this
in CaIista's house?
That who is your Iife?
Who you can't sIeep without?
Who you can't even breathe without?
Etc.. Etc.. Etc..
Just say yes, and I'II get rid ofthese
CaIistas and Baristas.

Come down, and take your notations.
I don't need any notations.
Once my brother has sung it,
it's alI memorised here. That's aII.
You memorised it after
hearing it just once.
That's my styIe.
I don't make my brother repeat things.
Brother, give me some space.
What a meter you've chosen.
You know, you can make such
wonderfuI tunes on this meter.
Look, your tune in
Hindi movie styIe.
What have you done to my heart?
''Just doesn't
beIong to meany more.''
What have you done to my heart?
''Just doesn't

'WhiIes truggIing with Iife''
I tried to Iock horns with God.'
'I asked Him, ''If You gave
me obsession of music..''
..why did You give
the talent to Mannu?
What was Iacking in my efforts?
Which sacrificedid I
stiII need to make?
What was the reason to
give him the magic..
..who considered alI
of this a joke?
What was the reason to
give Mannu such a voice?
'If Mannu hadn't been my friend..'
'..I wouId've asked
for something eIse.'
'But Mannu was my friend,
that's why I asked God..'
..to give my friend
aII the happiness.
To give him fame and fortune.
But give me a talent Iike him.
Because, onIy I have a right on it.
OnIy me.
Just me.
Attention pIease.
And with that, you become my wife.
Attention pIease.

How are the girIs there?
Party.
WiII there be girIs?
There are girIs.
Just send a big car, I'm coming.
You're going. - No one is paying
attention to me here.
Why shouId I stay?
You were quite serious about me?
So what ifI'm serious about you?
You shouId give your
acceptanceas weII.
Just say 'yes' once,
and I'II Ieave everyone for you.
In EngIish, it means the end to
alI of Mannu's other stories.
And in French, 'Fin'.
You've Iearnt French too. How?
I don't Iike to praise my seIf,
Chennai Express.
There've been many trains that
have halted at this station.
Just,the Chennai Express is deIayed.
It's not deIayed. ActuaIIy,
it doesn't take that routeat alI.
Hey, now I'II sIap you.
Don't I know that you Iove me?
Not at aII.
Look, Mannu can not read
books or magazines.
But he can read girIs' eyes.
Listen, I know what you think.
You think, ''Mannu is never
going to reform''.
So, it's no use saying yes.
And you know, what I think?
I think, ''TIII you don't say yes..''
..there's no reason for
Mannu to reform.
It's alI reasons.
- ReaIIy?.
You'II never reform.
You can never stay IoyaI to one.
Listen, say yes before
I get into the car..
..or else, I'm going.
So?
Look.
I'm going.
Listen, better stop me.
Look what's going on there.
You'II be alI alone.
The Ionger you take
the better for me.
Say yes. You shouIdn't
have such an ego.
Chennai Express, I'm going.
Papa.
Look.
Come on, Iet's go.
Sir, my name is Arjun.
Maybe you know me.
I want to teII you about a dream.
London Dreams.
It's no Ionger just my dream.
But also your daughter's now and,
of every Indian here.
The success which this band
has achieved here..
..no other Indian band
has ever attained it.
This band can go further.
And, so can your daughter.
But the decision Iies
entireIy in your hand.
Do you want to stand in
the way of your daughter?
Or, do you want her to achieve the
fame and fortune..
...that shede serves?
You're her father..
..and you've the right to take
decisions regarding her future.
But I know,
you aren't just a father..
..but aIso an Indian,
and a music Iover.
So, think twice before
taking any decision.
Love is in vaIuabIe.
Love calIs out to you.

He can't survive without it.
He's finished.

Manjeet KhosIa's 'London Dreams'
You'vefinalIy fuIfiIIed your dream.
You've reached WembIey.
That's whyit's important
for you to come.
The pIace, wherewe severed
alI ties with music..
..I'II rekindIe them again.
How are your preparations?
I'vebeen preparing for many years.
But, then you were aIone.
Now, Mannu is with you.
I'm taIking about myseIf
and you're taIking about Mannu.
I have to. After aII he's
a part of London Dreams.
But he isn't London Dreams.
I'II Ieave now.
Do come.
Big night, big boy.
Want some stuff?.
- What's your name?
Who sent you here?
You never asked my name before.
Why today?
I havea vaIid reason.
You'represenceat every pIace.
Leaving me alone in a
car fiIIed with drugs.
Coming backstage, in spite
of so much security.
Tryingto ruin me.
TelI me,who sent you here?
TeII me who you are, or else
I'II beat you bIack and bIue.
Where have you come from,
and why or eIse, I'II beat you bIack and bIue.
Okay, I'II teII you.
Okay, I forgave you.
TelI me,who sent you here?
Stop this charade, and teII me.
What are you doing?
- I trusted you, Mannu.
Priya.
Why the.. Priya.
Priya. Listen to me, Priya.
Priya. Where are you going?
I made a mistake.
I trusted you, Mannu.
- Priya, this girI is trying to ruin me.
Why wouId anyone want to ruin you?
Priya, she got me addicted to drugs.
I thought you'vere formed.
But no, this is what you Iike.
WelI. It's yourIife.
I don'thave anyrightto interfere.
- Priya.
Listen. You'retheonIy one that
has a right to interfere.
You'ret he onIy one.
No. Not anymore.
Now,there's nothing Ieft
between you and me.
You Iive your Iife.. and
I'II Iive mine.
Priya.
But.. I don'twant our differences
to haveany effect on the band.
On Arjun's dreams.
That's why, we'II work together
onIy as professionaIs.
I Ieft everthing for her.
No... No, dude.
But sheIeft me.
I heard everything.
I know you'rein pain.
You won't be abIe to perform welI.
But this show is very important
for aII ofus.
EspeciaIIy, for Arjun.
Here.
What is it?
Go here, and take it.
It's cIose by. But don't
take too much. Okay.
And remember, come back before
Arjun's soIo, okay?. - Sure.
Come soon.
Where is he going?
And,what was that chit
that you gave him?
It was the address of a drug-deaIer.
- What?
It's cIose-by.
You? You know, he won't be abIe
to stop him self this time.
He'II be ruined.
That's what I want.
- Why?.
Because, he snatched a way everything
that be longed to Arjun.
Our band, our songs, Iyrics
whose were they?
Arjun's. But, who got the name,
Iove and fortune Mannu!
So Paris, Rome you did alI that?
Yes, Paris, Rome,
Press Conference, everything.
And now, WembIey as welI.
I did it.
Because, tiII he's on stage
Arjun won't get whathe deserves.
And thankfuIIy, he'II never be
abIe to cIimb on stage again.
You scoundreI.. How couId you Zoheb,
how couId you? How couId you do this?
I aIways heeded what you said to me
but I knew that you wereright.
But today, you're wrong.
- What's wrong in it?
Arjun shouId get the
pIacehe deserves.
By ruining someoneeIse.
Just because he's more
taIented than Arjun.
TaIent?
AII hehas is style.
What does he know about music?
You're my brother.
You're my brother.
How couId you do this?
How couId you do this?
Listen, God! Now the
skies beIong to me.
Now the skies belong to me.
My dreams have now
turned to reality.
Now the skies belong to me.
Now the skies belong to me.
I've kissed the cIouds.
Now the skies belong to me.
I set out aIone with
the oars my self.
I've no faith in
the oars man at aII.
It's a celebration of victory.
Of victory, of victory, of victory.
My dreams have now
turned to reality.
Now the skies belong to me.
Now the skies belong to me.
''I've kissed the cIouds.''
Now the skies belong to me.
Now the skies belong to me.
I set outa I one with
the oars my self.
I've no faith in
the oars man at aII.
It's a celebration of victory.
''Of victory, of victory, of victory.''
It's a celebration of victory.
''Of victory, of victory, of victory.''
My feet aresore from the
thorns Iying on thepath.
At pIaces, the ground
was bIazing hot.
I averted, and endured much pain.
But I had no dearth of courage.
I stood my ground.
Faced the worst storms.
I fought against darkness,
and snatched Iight from it.
It was my part of dawn,
and your part of Iife.
It's a celebration of victory.
''Of victory, of victory, of victory.''
It's a celebration of victory.
''Of victory, of victory, of victory.''
We want Mannu.
Where is Mannu? CaII him.
He won't come.
Mannu won't come. He's finished.
Hey, Iights, Iights, I say Iights.
I put in my Iife, my hard
work to win your accIaims.
And you want Mannu.
Stop it.
Mannu won't come.
He won't come at any stage.
He's ruined.
Stop it.. He's finished
Yes, go a head cIap.
Take his name.
Mannu, see what's happening with me.
You caII your seIf a friend and Iook
at what you've done with me.
Whenever I sing, peopIe stiII
wait for you to sing.
Whenever I say anything,
they want to hear your voice.
Hit me, hit me, hit me..go on,
hit me, hit me some more.
It's my mistake, I brought him here.
But he snatched my fame
and my Iove from me.
Yes, Mannu. I Iove Priya.
Much before you did, and
much more than you do.
But, my tiffisn't with you.
It's with God.
And that's why, I had to vent
out alI my anger on you.
Because, He chose you and not me.
He didn't care about my efforts,
my hard work.
I asked for it,
but He gave the taIent to you.
I Ioved her, but He bIessed
you with that Iove.
This, fame, honour, music was
my dream, and not yours.
Then, how can you get it?
How can the music you
mocked aII your Iife..
..give you fame?
How can the music I worshipped
aII my Iife..
..make me unsuccessfuI?
I made this group.
This is not Manjeet KhosIa's
London Dreams.
This is my London Dreams
damn it!
Go to heII.
Can I come inside?
I've heard you don't meet
anyone these days.
Don't even take caIIs.
Don't go out.
How Iong wiII you keep
running from the worId?
The worId is over for me.
What's the use of running from it?
The worId is stiII there, Son.
You don't see it.
We often have this misunderstanding
that we'II be famous
a twhat we're good at.
Your grandfather was
a very good musician.
But he..couIdn't endurea singIe
faiIure and gave his Iife.
You're abetter
musician than he was.
But Mannu is more talented than you.
You couIdn't accept this.
That day, after your first concert
this is what I wanted to teII you.
What's the use? It's too Iate now.
If you do believe in this
don't try to give excuses.
Go, and get Mannu back.
How can I go back there?
Everyone might be a ware..
..of what I did with
my friend in London.
If you accept your mistake,
what are you afraid of?.
If you have the courage,
accept Mannu's taIent..
..and admit your mistake.
Then, you need not fear
facing the worId.
Come on. I'II come with you to the viIIage.
Let's end this story
where it had started.
Okay.
Son, Mannu toId us everything.
That useIess boy Ieft
you and came back.
He doesn't want to work.
He's extremeIy Iazy.
Son,we apoIogise on his be haIf.
Where's Mannu?
- There heis
When the worId wiII try to..
Know your worth.
A friend wiII say,
come give me a hug.
Who cares about the worId?
SiIence.
Did you seemy authority?
Business is doing reaI good.
By taking me to London,
you've doubIed my rate.
EarIier, I wouId get onIy Rs.2500.
But now, I get Rs.5000.
And these fooIs, telI me
change the name of..
..Raja-Rani Band to London Dreams.
What have I toId you?
That London Dreams is
my brother's band.
Forgive me, Mannu
Don't hurt me by apoIogising.
I shouId apoIogise to you.
I was so Iost in the joy in London..
..that I couIdn't see your sorrows.
I shouId apoIogise to you.
Being your friend, I couIdn't
feeI your pain.
I shouId apoIogise to you.
The day I found out that my
voice is your biggest enemy..
..I shouId havesIitit,
but I couIdn't do it.
I was wrong.
So, I shouId apoIogise to you.
For alI the mistakes,that
I committed unknow ingIy.
Am I? Am I?
Then why are you apoIogising to me.
Because, brother is after
aII a brother, Brother.
No apoIogising.
I'm so happy brother.
You've come to Punjab.
StiII it was my mistake.
I did wrong with you, and with Priya.
Then, apoIogise to Priya and not me.
Chennai Express, come here.
No apoIogies, Brother.
I knew that you'II come back one day.
That's why, no expIanations
and no saying sorry.
We'II onIy taIk about the future now.
And not the past.
To London then?
To London and London Dreams.
Let's rock the worId alI over again.
So,when do we Ieave?
- Right now.
Come on. We're going to London!
London, here we come.
- We are going to rock London.
The ones that wakes you up.
Keeps your sIumber at bay..
''..are dreams.''
The true ones..
..the ones that creep
in when you sIeep.
''The ones that you forget.''
''Those dreams..'' ''..are not true.''
Let your dreams soar.
Fuel your sIeep.
Light the fIame.
Sing Iike the cuckoo.
Are dreams.
The true ones.
The ones that makes waves..
..move even water..
..are dreams.
The true ones.
Let your dreams soar.
Fuel your sIeep.
There're celebrations on the way.
But those are your defeats.
Happiness is mean in gIess
without in.
Music is in compIete, so are
your tunes and melodies..
..and your Iife, without your kind.
''Let your dreams be your strength.''
But, don't Iose touch
with your kind.
The breeze says touch the sky.
''Let your wings soar.
Don't hoId back.''
Let your dreams soar.
''Fuel your sIeep.''
