- What?!
-
That was barely
worth the effort, Adagio.
I'm tired of fast food.
I need a meal.
The energy in this world
isn't the same as in Equestria.
We can only gain
so much power here.
Ugh, I wish we'd never
been banished to this awful place.
Really?
I love it here.
For realsies? Because I think
this place is the worst.
I think you're the worst,
Sonata.
Oh, yeah?
Well, I think you're--
I'll tell you one thing--
being stuck here
with you two
isn't making this world
any more bearable.
Did you feel that?
Do you know what that is?
Both: Uh-uh.
It's Equestrian magic.
But this world doesn't
have Equestrian magic.
It does now.
And we're going to use it
to make everyone
in this pathetic
little world adore us.
We used to fight
with each other
Oh, whoa-- whoa-- whoa
That was before
we discovered
Oh, whoa-- whoa-- whoa
Back when your
friendship was real
Oh, whoa-- whoa-- whoa
Yeah, you just say
what you feel
And the music
Yeah, the music
Gets us to the top
As we learn how the rainbow
Rainbow rocks
You can pick up the bass
Oh, whoa-- whoa-- whoa
And you can play the guitar
Oh, whoa-- whoa-- whoa
You can bang on the drums
Oh, whoa-- whoa-- whoa
Or you can sing like a star
And the music
Yeah, the music
Gets us to the top
As we learn
how the rainbow
Rainbow rocks
As we learn
how the rainbow
Rainbow rocks.
- Want some help?
- Uh, no, thanks. We're good.
Oh, okay.
Sunset Shimmer,
over here!
I had no idea
the whole school would be here.
Quite the eye-catching
advertisement if I do say so myself.
And it smells like cake.
It does?
I used frosting
instead of paste.
Uh, Fluttershy, you've got
a little something... uh...
- Did I get it?
- Not exactly.
Good afternoon,
students.
Ijust wanted
to tell you all
how pleased I am
that so many of you
are going to participate
in the first ever
Canterlot High School
musical showcase.
This is a wonderful
opportunity
to raise money for all
our after-school programs
here at CHS.
So keep working on
those signs and posters.
I think it's going to be
one of the most exciting
events we've had at CHS
since the Fall Formal.
I am never gonna
live that down.
You were pretty bad
at the Fall Formal.
A demon. I turned into
a raging she-demon.
And tried to turn everyone here
into teenage zombies
for your own
personal army.
Oh, darling, you have us.
And we've forgiven you
for your past-- ahem-- boo-boos.
To be honest, I'd say
the whole experience
brought everyone at Canterlot High
closer than ever before.
One, two, three.
There was a time
we were apart
But that's behind us now
See how we've made
a brand-new start
And the future's
looking up
Oh, oh
And when you
walk these halls
You feel it everywhere
Yeah, we're
the Wondercolts forever
Oh, yeah
We are all together
Oh, oh, oh
Now is better than ever
Oh, oh, oh
You can feel it
We are back and I 'm so glad
that we're better
Better than ever
Oh, wha, oh, wha, oh
Oh, yeah,
we're better than ever
Oh, wha, oh, wha, oh
There was a time we couldn't see
past the differences
That separated you and me
and it left us on our own
But now you walk these halls
And friends are everywhere
Yeah, we're
the Wondercolts forever
Oh, yeah
We are all together
Oh, oh, oh
Now is better than ever
Oh, oh, oh
Now that we are back on track
Yes, I 'm so glad that we're better
Better than ever
Oh, wha, oh, wha, oh
Oh, yeah,
we're better than ever
Oh, wha, oh, wha, oh
Oh, yeah,
we're better than ever
Oh, wha, oh, wha, oh
Oh, yeah,
we're better than ever.
I still can't believe
that happens when we play.
Ooh, I've got to look
into some new accessories.
Something that looks good
in a longer ponytail.
Ooh, maybe some
clip-on earrings
for when I get those
adorable pony ears.
I just wonder
why it happens.
Princess Twilight took
her crown back to Equestria.
Shouldn't that mean she took
all the magic back with her?
Who cares why it happens?
It makes my band
totally awesome.
Oh, your band?
Duh, it was my idea
to start the Rainbooms
so we could be
in the showcase.
Plus, I'm the lead singer
and guitarist.
Heard you outside.
You guys are sounding
really tight.
Uh, we're getting there.
Rarity's still coming in a little late
on the second verse
and App|ejack's bass solo
could use a little work.
They'll get it together
in time for the showcase.
Uh, I don't suppose
any of our friends
from out of town might come?
It being a special
charity event and all.
Sorry, Flash, I don't think
Twilight's gonna be back
at Canterlot
High any time soon.
Oh, yeah. Okay.
Just, you know,
thought I'd ask.
Uh, keep on rocking it.
Well, someone is quite
the smitten kitten.
Ooh, sorry.
I always forget you and Flash
used to be an item.
It's okay.
Flash is a great guy and all,
but I never really
liked him liked him.
I was just using him
to become more popular.
The old me
really was just awful, wasn't she?
—
- Yup.
But the important thing
is that you've turned yourself around.
Thanks, Applejack.
But I'm not sure everyone else
at CHS feels the same way.
Woman on P.A.: Sunset Shimmer,
please report to the main foyer.
Gotta run. I volunteered to show some
new students around the school.
Thought it would be good
for them to get to know the new me
before they heard
all the stuff about the old me.
We've still got a few minutes
before lunch starts,
what do you say we do
"Awesome as I Wanna Be"?
Um, Rainbow Dash,
I was wondering if we maybe
could play the song I wrote.
We'll get to it.
Oh, okay.
Hi. Are you the girls
I'm supposed to show around?
We are.
Canterlot High
is a great school.
You're really
gonna love it.
Oh, yes.
We really sense there's something
magical about this place.
That's the science lab.
Computer lab
is in there.
Ooh, we're having a big
musical showcase this weekend.
The whole school is
pretty much rallying around it.
A musical showcase?
I'm sure since you're new,
Principal Celestia
will let you sign up
if you're interested.
We have been known to sing
from time to time.
Hello?
We sing, like, all the time.
It's how we get people
to do what we want.
-
- What did I say?
What you meant to say
was that being in
a musical showcase
sounds like a great way
to meet other students.
Oh, yeah.
What she said,
I meant to say.
That's what I meant...
to say.
And what you would have said
if you weren't the worst.
You are.
You have to excuse them.
They're idiots.
Both: Hmmph.
Sunset:
Those are pretty.
Where did you--
Sorry. These pendants
mean an awful lot to us.
We'd just hate for anything
to happen to them.
- So how was the tour?
- I don't know.
I mean, these girls,
they were--
there was something off
about them.
Like off like this?
Or off like this?
Or-- ooh, |ike--
Maybe we should
just let her tell us?
That's just it.
I can't put my finger on it.
They just acted sort of
strange around me.
Maybe someone already
talked to them.
Told them about what I did.
So much for making
a good first impression.
Uh—huh.
Ooh, that's
probably not it.
This is it, girls.
The moment we've
been waiting for.
Lunch?
The chance to get our
true Equestrian magic back.
Oh, right.
Our voices are
just strong enough
to make them want
something so badly,
they'll fight to get it.
So we're just gonna do
what we always do?
Stir up some trouble
and then feed off the negative energy?
Some plan, Adagio.
It won't be the same
as the times before.
There is Equestrian
magic here.
Their negative energy
will give us the power we need
to get this entire world
to do our bidding.
But we can get lunch after,
though, right?
It's Taco Tuesday.
- Just follow my lead.
- Or my lead.
My lead.
We heard you want
to get together
We heard you want
to rock this school
We've got something
that is better
Something that changes
all the rules
Why pretend
we're all the same?
When some of us
shine brighter
Here's a chance
to find your flame
Are you a loser or a fighter?
Me and you,
you and me
Why don't we see
who is better?
We don't have to be
one and the same thing
Oh, what's so wrong
with a little competition?
Are you afraid of failing
the audition?
You're a star
and you should know it
Now you rise above the rest
It doesn't matter who you hurt
If you're just proving
you're the best
Battle,
you want to win it
Let's have a battle
Battle of the bands
Let's have a battle
We'll go all in it
Let's have a battle
Battle, battle
Battle of the bands...
I can beat you.
- Battle...
- Ha! You wish.
- Battle...
- I so want this.
- Battle...
- Not ifl get it first.
Me and you,
you and me
Why don't we see
who is better?
We don't have to be
one and the same thing
Oh, what's so wrong
with a little competition?
I'm going out there,
winning the audition
Battle
We want to win it
Let's have a battle
Battle of the bands
Let's have a battle
We'll go all in it
Let's have a battle
Battle, battle
Battle of the bands.
Oh, they're
that kind of off.
Those three are definitely
in possession
of some kind
of dark magic.
How else could you explain
what happened back there?
Don't worry, y'all. We let Principal
Celestia know all about this
and those girls will be kicked
to the curb in no time.
Last thing she needs
is another CHS event
almost ruined by some
power-crazed lunatic.
Uh, no offense.
None taken.
Dark magic?
I find that
very hard to believe.
Those girls came into
my office earlier
and were
absolutely delightful.
Perhaps Sunset Shimmer
is just eager to make someone
else out to be a bad element
so that her actions at the Fall Formal
will become old news.
I could see why
you might think that, but--
That's not what's happening.
We saw all of this go down
in the cafeteria, too.
Yes, but isn't your band
supposed to be part of
the musical showcase?
Yes.
Perhaps you're all
just worried
that the Dazzlings
will steal your spotlight.
The Dazzlings?
It's the name
of their musical group.
That's why they came by
my office earlier.
To sign up for the showcase.
Even sang a little song
to Vice Principal Luna and I.
- They did?
- Yes.
And we think having
a battle of the bands
instead is
a marvelous idea.
I can't believe they got
to Principal Celestia
and Vice Principal Luna, too.
They've gotten
to everybody.
- Not everybody.
- Pinkie Pie's right.
We were there when
the Dazzlings were singing
and we weren't affected.
It was like we were
protected somehow.
So let's take them down.
It's not like we haven't tangled
with dark magic before
and totally whupped
its sorry butt.
Uh, no offense.
None taken.
Again.
But that was when
Twilight was here.
There may be some kind
of magic inside us,
but it only comes out
when we play music.
I sure don't know
how to use it
to "whup anybody's butt."
If only we could get
a message to Twilight.
Maybe she could tell us
how to break the spell
the Dazzlings have cast
on our friends.
Well, that's not gonna happen.
The porta|'s closed.
And I get the feeling
they don't exactly have
cell phones where she's from.
I may have an idea
how we can get in touch
with Princess Twilight.
When I was Princess Ce|estia's
student back in Equestria,
she gave me this.
Even after I abandoned my studies,
I held on to it.
Deep down, I guess I knew
I was making a big mistake
and I still wanted a way
to reach out to her.
Maybe it still works.
Rarity:
That's a book, darling.
What do you mean
maybe still works?
It used to be that
if I wrote something here,
it would appear in the pages of a book
back in Princess Ce|estia's library.
I get a message to her,
then she can get a message
to Princess Twilight.
So what are you waiting for?
Get to writing.
Huh.
Been a longtime since
I've written these words.
"Dear Princess Ce|estia."
Excuse me, Princess,
where do you want all these
books from Princess Celestia?
The library.
Third door on the left.
Even this one that's glowing
and vibrating?
What is it, Twilight?
It looks like a message
to Princess Celestia
from my friends
at Canterlot High.
How is that even possible?
I have no idea,
but it sounds like
they need my help.
The way Sunset Shimmer
described them,
I think these new girls
sound an awful lot like
the Sirens.
Not the Sirens!
I don't actually know
what that is.
The Sirens were three beautiful
but dangerous creatures
who had the power to charm
ponies with their music.
But to maintain this power,
they had to feed on the negativity
and distrust of others.
The more of this
negative energy they consumed,
the stronger
their voices became
and the farther they could
spread their dark magic.
I don't think I like
this story very much.
Twilight:
If the Sirens had their way,
they would have divided
and conquered all of Equestria.
But a certain Star Swirl the Bearded
wasn't having it.
Rumor has it he found a way
to banish them to another world.
One where he believed
their magic power would be lost.
That world must have been the one
where my Canterlot High friends live.
But Star Swirl must have
sent them there ages ago.
How come they're
just surfacing now?
I don't know,
but if my hunch is right
and it is the Sirens
who have come to Canterlot High,
this spell they've cast
is just the beginning.
My friends need me.
I have to get back to them.
I hate to burst your bubble,
Twilight,
but the connection between
their world and Equestria
will still be totally cut off
for a super long time.
Okay, first of all, if there was bubble
blowing going on,
why wasn't I told about it?
And secondly, if the connection
is totally cut off,
how was Sunset Shimmer
able to get a message to Twilight?
Pinkie, you're a genius.
Yeah, I get that a lot.
Now about those bubbles.
Twilight: ...and the interval between
the two points is defined
as the square root of the sum
of the squares of the separation
between the points along
three spatial dimensions.
- Say what now?
- Duh.
She's gonna take the magic
in here and put it in there.
That'l| make the portal open up
so that whenever she wants to,
she can go
from here to there.
There to here.
Here-there.
- There to here. Here to there. There--
- We get the idea.
Now to see
if it actually works.
All: Ooh.
All: Ahh.
Don't suppose we could
join you this time around?
Better not.
It could make things
pretty confusing if Canterlot High
all of a sudden had
two of all of you.
But I still get to go, right?
There isn't another one of me
at Canterlot High.
And you never know when you might
need your trusty assistant.
- Mm-hmm.
- Yes!
We won't be gone long.
And don't forget
to dress well.
Ready, Spike?
Ready.
I'm starting to think
she's not coming.
All:
Twilight!
Ooh. I'm back.
All:
Oh, Twilight.
I've got some bad news
about those new girls.
Oh, I do hate that you had
to return at a time of crisis.
We have so much
catching up to do.
For starters, a certain blue-haired
guitar player was just asking about you.
Flash Sentry
was asking about me?
Ahem.
Isn't that nice?
Perhaps you could give us just the
slightest bit of gossip from your world?
She's got
an official title now.
The Princess of Friendship.
Wow, that's
really impressive.
Guess you really were
Princess Ce|estia's prize pupil.
She's even got
her own castle.
A castle?!
You have your own castle?!
Uh, ahem.
Oh, lovely.
What's new here?
I mean, besides your school
becoming the target
of dangerous magical creatures
from Equestria.
Yeah,
so that isn't exactly
the only strange thing
that's happened since you left.
...and I'm so glad
that we're better...
Pretty sweet, huh?
It happens to all of us
when we play.
Hmm. My crown
was returned to Equestria,
but some of its magic must have
remained here at Canterlot High.
Now that we're
all back together,
we can use that magic
on the Sirens.
Just like when we were able to use it
on Sunset Shimmer
when she turned into
that horrifyingly awful winged monster.
No offense.
None taken.
I'm used to it.
They'll never even know
what hit ‘em.
We've got nothing to worry about
now that Twilight's back.
Oh, I'm pretty sure I could
find something to worry about.
But it won't be the Sirens.
The sooner we do this,
the better.
Any idea where
the Dazzlings might be?
Ahh.
There's a big party tonight
for all the bands
who signed up
to be in the showcase.
That would include
the Dazzlings.
Looks like we've got
a party to crash.
I'm gonna get more punch.
Twilight?
Oh, bumped into--
always doing...
What are you doing here?
You came back for
the big competition, right?
Something like that.
Not that there's going to be
any real competition.
No one here wants this
as bad as my band does.
Can you excuse me
forjust a minute?
Adagio:
Oh, no. No one's mingling.
It's like there's some kind
of underlying tension
that could bubble
to the surface at any minute.
It's the fruit punch,
isn't it?
I knew I used
too much grape juice.
It's not the fruit punch,
it's us.
But the punch is awful, too.
What do you know
about good fruit punch?
More than you.
- Do not.
- Do, too.
This is just
the kickoff party, girls.
Imagine what a tizzy
they'll be in
by the time the battle of
the bands starts.
There isn't going to be
a battle of the bands.
We're gonna make sure
of that.
All right, girls,
let's do this.
Friendship is magic.
Uh, weren't there rainbows
and lasers and stuff last time?
I don't understand.
We're all together again.
Why isn't this working?
You, uh, really
need to go ahead
and do that whole
"magic of friendship" thing now.
I'm trying, Spike.
I thought the six of us standing
together against the Sirens
would bring out the magic
we needed to defeat them.
That's what happened before.
Talk about throwing down
the gauntlet.
This group is obviously
serious about winning.
A little cocky,
though, aren't they?
Claiming there won't
really be a battle.
Seems they think they've already got
this thing all locked up.
Not if the great and powerful
Trixie has anything to do with it.
Whatever, Trixie.
We're the best band at CHS.
No. The Crusaders
are gonna win.
Adagio: I think we may have found
what we're looking for.
Or rather,
it found us.
Magic.
Don't you see?
Everyone else has fallen
under our spell.
But not these girls.
These girls are special.
It doesn't make any sense.
I should have been able
to create the spark
that would help us
break their spell.
That's how it worked before.
But to defeat me, you drew magic
from the crown I was wearing.
The Sirens‘ magic
comes from their music...
so maybe you have to use
the same kind of magic to defeat them.
Or maybe not.
- No, I think you're onto something.
- Really?
It's when you play music
that you transform now, right?
Yup. Ears, tails,
the whole shebang.
So maybe the way to use that magic
to defeat the Sirens
is by playing a musical
counterspell.
- You mean like a song?
- Uh—huh.
And in order to free everyone
who's been exposed to the Sirens spell,
we'll need them all
to hear it.
All: Hmm.
The band competition.
That's the next time
we can be certain
everyone will be in the same place
at the same time.
Guess the Rainbooms are
the band to beat.
And I believe,
you, Twilight,
just became the Rainbooms‘
newest member.
So what do you
want to play?
Triangle?
Sousaphone?
- Theremin?
-
So magical.
I might take
a little too long
to learn how to play
something with these.
I'll just sing.
Like as in lead singer?
‘Cause that's
usually my gig.
This being
my band and all.
It's our band.
And of course
as lead singer.
She's the one with the magical knowhow
to help us pull this thing off.
Okay, yeah, that's cool.
I'll just use this
as a chance
to hone my already insanely
good lead guitar skills.
It's only temporary.
And we don't have to win
the battle of the bands.
We just have to perform during
the first round of the competition.
So let's get to learning
that musical counterspell.
Well, that's just it.
I don't know any.
But I'm sure I could
figure out how to write one.
Totally. Twilight can write a spell
like it's nobody's business.
That's pretty much how she got to become
a princess in Equestria.
Technically,
I helped finish a spell.
And there was a little more
to it than that, Spike.
Yeah, whatever.
I've got this.
Come on.
Where are you going?
Well,
last time we were here,
Spike and I spent the night
in the library.
Are you crazy?
We're besties now.
Slumber party at my house.
Status update--
okey dokey, Loki.
Hey.
I was about to beat you.
I doubt it.
So, Twilight, how's that
counterspell coming?
Huh? Oh, uh, good. Great.
Thanks for letting me
use your notebook, Fluttershy.
I really like the song
you wrote for the Rainbooms.
Thanks.
Hopefully one day,
we'll get a chance to play it.
-
- Hey!
Twilight, I think I speak
for all of us when I say
I don't know what we would've done
if you hadn't come back to help us.
All: Uh—huh.
Pizza's here.
Don't you want any pizza?
No, that's not gonna work.
Hey, Twilight.
You're up late.
Just looking over
the counterspell.
We only get one shot at this.
It has to be perfect.
We really are lucky
you're here.
That's what everyone
keeps telling me.
Who could possibly need
this much whipped cream?
It must be nice
to have everyone
always looking to you
for answers to their problems
instead of waiting for you
to cause a problem.
Just because everyone
expects something from you
doesn't mean it's guaranteed
to happen.
But that doesn't stop them
from expecting it.
Which only make things harder
because the last thing
you want to do is...
Both:
Let everybody down.
Boulder was hungry.
I still can't get over the fact that
she's related to Pinkie Pie.
You and me both.
I better get some sleep.
Good luck with
the counterspell.
Not that you'll need it.
This must be nothing
compared to the stuff
you're expected to deal with
as a princess in Equestria.
Sunset Shimmer...
Never mind.
It's not important.
No, I have to be able
to do this.
I have to.
-
- Hey, hey, listen
We've got a message
for you
We're not all alike
But our friendship is true
Yeah, we're really different
But we still get along
So, hey, he!’
Listen to our song
You may think you're in control
But we're here
to prove you wrong
With the friendship
of our music
With the power of our song
Gonna stomp our feet,
clap our hands
With our magical friendship
Gonna stop your evil plan.
Eh, that sounded
way better
than the last five times
you played it.
-
- Nope.
I think it's pretty obvious
what's going wrong
with this counterspell.
You're turning what should be the chorus
into a five-minute guitar solo?
I have to pick up
the slack somehow.
Are you guys even trying?
I'm trying-
It's fine.
I'll be fine.
One more time from the top.
Or perhaps we could take
a short break--
try on some of the wardrobe choices
I put together.
I'm particularly fond
of this one.
Of course we could always go
with something a bit more modern.
We're trying to
save our school here.
Enough with the costumes.
You can never have
enough costumes.
She just wants
to make things fun.
Isn't that what being
in a band is supposed to be?
You don't have time
for any of this.
You're supposed to check in at the
battle of the bands in 15 minutes.
-
- Oh, no!
But-- but it's not ready.
If we play the counterspell
in the first round and it doesn't work,
the Sirens will know
what we're up to
and make sure we don't
get a chance to play it again.
Then we'll have to
buy ourselves some time
so you can keep
working on it.
And how do you propose
we do that?
We compete in the battle
of the bands for real.
I take over lead vocals again
and we stay alive until the finals.
We unleash
the counterspell then.
You'll have figured it out
by the finals, right?
Of course she will.
Twilight Spark|e's never met
a problem she couldn't solve.
— Right, Twilight?
— Right.
Then let's go win us
a battle of the bands.
Welcome to the first ever
Canterlot High School
battle of the bands.
I believe I speak
for everyone when I say
it is by far
the greatest thing
we have ever done
here at this school.
We are so glad
our three newest students
encouraged us
to turn this event
into something exciting.
But as this is now
a competition,
we can only choose
one winner.
Who is it going to be?
You feel that, girls?
Our true power
is being restored.
Adagio:
And that's before
we've tapped into
the strongest magic here.
But the Rainb|ossoms--
or whatever they're called--
aren't under our spell.
How exactly are we supposed
to get to their magic?
The Rainbooms
are just as capable
of falling apart
as anyone else.
They just need a little push
in the wrong direction.
I have a feeling
everyone here
is going to be lining up
to give them a shove.
Oh, yeah. Snips and Snails
in the house, yo.
They call me M. C. Ships
and it ain't no lie
My favorite food
is like pumpkin pie
I 'm D.J. Snazzy Snails,
I like whales
When I go to the beach,
I always bring my pail
Everybody knows
my favorite color is orange
My rhymes are so fly,
they're better than, um...
Than an orange, yo
- Yeah, represent
- Yeah
What do we--
what do we do now?
Get off the stage,
I'd like to leave right now.
Bam. That just happened.
- Yeah, we out.
- Snip and Snails outta here.
Please do not
drop the microphones.
- Yeah.
- Bam.
In your face, Rainbooms.
At least we know one group
who won't stand in the way
of us getting to the finals.
Let's get ready to rock.
Wait,
where's Rarity?
Ooh, here. I'm here.
We will be performing
in front of an audience.
I'm not going to wear
something fabulous? Hmm.
Remember, we have to be
good enough to make it through,
but not so good we let the Sirens
see the magic within us.
They could realize we plan
to use it against them.
Got it.
Be cool enough to win,
but not so cool
that we end up showing off
the whole ears and tails
and rainbows thing.
So about 20% less cool.
- One, two.
- We just got the day
To get ready
And there's only
so much time to lose
Because tonight, yeah,
we're here to party
So let's think of
something fun to do
We don't know
what's gonna happen
We just know
it's gonna feel right
All our friends are here
And it's time
to ignite the lights
Shake your tail 'cause we're here
to have a party tonight
Shake your tail,
shake your tail
Shake your tail 'cause we're here
to have a party tonight
Shake your tail,
shake your tail...
So what you didn't get it
right the first time?
Boﬁng.
Laugh it off,
no one said it is a crime
Do your thing,
you know you're an original
Your ideas are so funny
that they're criminal
- Ohh, ahh
-
We've just got the day
to get ready
And there's only
so much time to lose
Because tonight, yeah,
we're here to party
So let's think of
something fun to do
-
- Awesome.
We don't know
What's gonna happen
We just know
it's gonna feel right
All our friends are here
And it's time
to ignite the lights
Shake your tail 'cause we're here
to have a party tonight
Shake your tail,
shake your tail
Shake your tail 'cause we're here
to have a party tonight
Shake your tail,
shake your tail
Shake your tail 'cause we're here
to have a party tonight
- Shake your tail, shake your tail
-
Shake your tail 'cause we're here
to have a party tonight
Shake your tail,
shake your tail
Shake your tail 'cause we're here
to have a party tonight.
Ruined.
Absolutely ruined.
Rarity, were you trying
to make us lose out there?
What--
this was not my fault.
This was an act of sabotage.
Yeah, well, whoever did this
couldn't have done this
if you didn't insist
on dressing |ike-- like this.
We need to sound good.
Is there some reason
that concept seems to escape you?
And what was
with the confetti, Pinkie Pie?
How am I supposed to shred
if there's paper stuck in my frets?
- It was pretty distracting.
- Ah!
Says the girl who was running
from a light the whole time.
A light!
You still sounded
much better
than most
of the other bands.
I'm sure you'll make it
to the next round.
But it won't matter if you don't
have that counterspell ready.
You all find a place to practice
where the Sirens can't hear you,
I'll keep an eye on things
around here.
I don't think we should
use a classroom.
We really need to stop bumping
into each other like this.
Uh, you guys
hear something?
- Uh-uh.
- Uh, no.
I said we have to stop--
There it is again.
So annoying.
Why are you
acting like this?
I thought
we were friends.
Yeah, and then you decide
to come back here
just so you can beat me
in the battle of the bands.
I want this, Twilight,
and you're trying to take it from me.
Some friend.
That's not why--
Come on, Twilight.
We've got things to do.
You really think
you're gonna help them?
I bet you have no idea
what you're even doing.
Tears already?
This is only
the first round.
Principal Celestia:
The next band to take the stage
will be Trixie
and the Illusions.
Better head back.
We're supposed to go on after Trixie.
You're never gonna
get away with this.
Why, because you didn't?
Oh, we know all about you,
Sunset Shimmer.
You've got quite
the reputation at Canterlot High.
I've changed.
I'm in a much better place now.
Waiting in the wings
while your friends have all the fun?
Oh, yes,
you girls are so tight.
And yet they didn't ask you
to be in the band?
Probably afraid no one
would want to see them play
if she was
in the group.
Too bad.
So sad.
Adagio:
If it's any consolation,
no one is going to
remember you at all
by the time
we're done.
Remember, girls,
we want to save the good stuff
for when our full power
has been restored.
-
- Oh, whoa, oh, whoa
You didn't know
that you fell
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa
Now that you're
under our spell
Blindsided by the beat
Clapping your hands,
stomping your feet
You didn't know
that you fell
Oh
Now you've fallen
under our spell
Oh
We've got the music,
makes you move it
Got the song
that makes you lose it
We say, "Jump,"
you say, "How high?"
Put your hands up
to the sky
We've got the music,
makes you move it
Got the song
that makes you lose it
We say, "Jump,"
you say, "How high?"
Put your hands up
to the sky
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa
You didn't know
that you fell
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa
Now that you're
under our spell
Listen to the sound
of my voice
Oh
Soon you'll find
you don't have a choice
Oh
Captured in the web
of my song
Oh
Soon you'll all
be singing along
Oh
We've got the music,
makes you move it
Got the song
that makes you lose it
We say, "Jump,"
you say, "How high?"
Put your hands up
to the sky
We've got the music,
makes you move it
Got the song
that makes you lose it
We say, "Jump,"
you say, "How high?"
Put your hands up
to the sky
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa
You didn't know
that you fell
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa
Now that you're
under our spell
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa
You didn't know
that you fell
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa
Now that you're
under our spell.
This is it, last round
and you're in the finals.
Unless you think the counterspell
is ready to be played now.
Don't worry, Twilight,
finals aren't until tonight.
We'll get in a little
more practice
before we're
supposed to hit the stage.
- We won't let you down.
- All: Yeah.
You won't let me down.
F|uttershy:
Um, I was just wondering,
we haven't played any
of my songs yet and--
It's the semifinals.
We've gotta do
"Awesome as I Wanna Be."
I don't know why I even asked.
got tricks
up my sleeve
See me dominate 'cause
I'm powerful and great.
Oh! Fantastic.
You're never gonna top
that performance, "Raingoons."
You shouldn't
be allowed to
when you have such
a big advantage over the rest of us.
My superior guitar playing
and off-the-charts
awesome singing voice?
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
I mean her.
If you were really all that,
Rainbow Dash,
you wouldn't have needed
to bring in some magical ringer
to have half a chance.
Everyone's talking about it.
Ha! Please.
I could win this thing
as a solo act
and everybody knows it.
Sure, you could.
She's gone!
Oh, wait.
There she is.
Principal Celestia:
Next up, the Rainbooms.
- Knock ‘em dead, Rainbooms.
- I'll be here.
Just watching.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
- Awesome as I wanna be
Hey, hey: hey’
hey, hey, he!’
Awesome as I wanna be
First you see me
riding on a sonic boom
Got my guitar
shredding up my latest tune
There is nothing
you can do to beat me
I'm so good
that you can't defeat me
Yeah, I'm awesome,
take caution
Watch out for me,
I'm awesome as I wanna be
Yeah, I'm awesome,
take caution
Watch out for me,
I'm as awesome as I wanna be
Hey, hey: hey’
hey, hey, he!’
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey.
Now that's the bad girl
we love to hate.
-
- I knew she was still trouble.
Boy:
The real Sunset Shimmer is back.
No, it isn't like that.
What was that?
You were showing them
your magic.
I didn't know
what else to do.
Close the curtains.
Unplug her amp.
Give us a chance to deal
with the situation.
I'm sorry.
Ijust wanted to help.
Yeah, well, you didn't.
None of this would've happened
if you weren't trying to show off.
As usual.
Good show, "Rainbrooms."
I especially like the part
where Sunset Shimmer,
in a fit ofjealous rage,
knocked out Rainbow Dash
mid guitar solo.
It wasn't a fit
ofjealous rage.
If you say so.
Ooh, looks like
they've already decided
who'll be moving on
to the finals.
I'm guessing it wasn't
too difficult a decision.
- Huh?
- Rarity: What can we do?
There isn't gonna be another
opportunity for us to play.
And I had the most gorgeous
outfit for the finals.
Yup, 'cause that's
he real tragedy here, Rarity.
That you won't
get to play dress-up.
You know perfectly well
that is not what I meant.
You guys wanna
keep it down?
They're about to
announce who's moving on.
Who are you kidding?
You know it isn't
gonna be us.
The band that will be joining
the Dazzlings in tonight's finals...
the Rainbooms.
-What?!
—All: Huh?
Did they just say
"The Rainbooms"?
This isn't over.
Congratulations, girls.
You deserve it.
Seriously?
We didn't even finish our--
See you at tonight's
big show, Rainbooms.
We are really
looking forward to it.
Yeah, well,
not as much as we are.
This never should have been you,
Rainbooms.
This is a travesty.
A travesty!
It really is.
The Rainbooms don't deserve
to be in the finals.
Not when your band
was so much better in the semis.
And wanted it
so much more.
Alas, this is the way
it's going to be.
Dazzlings
versus Rainbooms.
Unless, of course, the Rainbooms
don't manage to make it to their set
were held up
for some reason.
Hmm?
Check one, two.
Testing. Testing.
- Testing.
-
This doesn't
make any sense.
We were awful.
Doesn't anybody else
think it's strange
that we're the ones
that made it to the finals?
Very strange.
What are you doing here,
Trixie?
Pretty sure the losers are supposed
to be up there in the cheap seats.
The great and powerful Trixie
is the most talented girl
at Canterlot High.
It is I who deserve to be
in the finals.
And I will not be denied.
See you never.
Told you someone
would give them a shove.
She didn't shove them,
she pulled the lever.
Oh, go back to sleep,
Sonata.
You better believe
I've got tricks up my sleeve
And I captivate 'cause
I'm powerful and great
You'd better believe
I've got tricks up my sleeve
See me dominate 'cause
I'm powerful and great...
App|ejack:
Give it up, Rainbow Dash.
You've been trying at this for hours.
It's not gonna open.
Maybe it doesn't even matter
that we're trapped down here.
I don't think the counterspell
would've worked anyway.
‘Course it would've worked,
Twilight.
Assuming a certain band member
didn't try to hog the spotlight
the whole time
we were trying to play it.
Hey, if you want
to tell Twilight
she's getting
a little too caught up
trying to be the new leader of this
band,
you don't have to be
all cryptic about it.
She was talking about you,
Rainbow Dash.
Me?!
I'm just trying
to make sure my band
rocks as hard
as it needs to.
All:
Our band!
But why wasn't it working?
I should know what to do.
How can I not know
what to do?
How could I
have failed like this?
It might've been your idea
to start a band,
but it's not just your band,
Rainbow Dash.
I'm the one who writes
all the songs.
I write songs.
You just never let us play any of them.
I had the most perfect
outfits for us to wear.
Again with the costumes.
No one cares
what we're wearing.
I care, Applejack.
So sorry if I enjoy trying to make
a creative contribution to the band.
Hey, anybody here
remember fun?!
I'll give you a hint--
it's the exact opposite
of being in the Rainbooms!
I wish I never asked
any of you to be in my band.
- I wish I never agreed to be in it!
- Both: Me neither.
Yeah, yeah
Better believe
I've got tricks up my sleeve
See me dominate 'cause
I'm powerful and great.
Try to top that.
Oh, gosh,
I don't know if we can.
Stop!
You have to stop!
This is what
they've been after all along.
They're feeding off
of the magic inside you.
How can they
be using our magic?
It's the magic
of friendship.
Ever since you started
this band,
you've been letting
little things get to you.
I never said anything 'cause
I didn't feel like it was my place.
Not when I was so new to this
whole friendship thing.
I still have a lot to learn.
But I do know that
if you don't work out
even the smallest problems
right at the start,
the magic of friendship
can be turned into something else.
I can't believe
all this tension was happening
right under my nose
and I didn't realize it.
I'm supposed to be the one
with all the answers.
And all I've done
since I got here is let you down.
I don't think anyone
is supposed to have all the answers.
But you can count
on your friends to help you find them.
I think you already have.
Come on, we need to
get out of here.
Spike!
Sorry I took so long.
I had to find somebody who wasn't
under the Sirens‘ spell
to help me get you out.
Why isn't she
under their spell?
Never takes off
herheadphones.
Come on, y'all.
Time to prove we've still got the magic
of friendship inside us.
And there's only
one way to do it.
We're getting the band
back together?
We're getting
our band back together.
- Whee!
- Oh, which version of the counterspell
are we going to play?
I don't think it matters
what song we play
as long as we play it
together as friends.
I know just the song.
F|uttershy's written
a really great one.
We're about to
save the world here.
Personally,
I think we should do it in style.
- Rarity?
- I thought you'd never ask.
Welcome to the show
We're here
to let you know
Our time is now
Your time is running out
How are we supposed
to play over them from up here?
Feel the wave of sound
As it crashes down
You can't turn away
We'll make you wanna stay
We will be adored
Tell us that you want us
We won't be ignored
It's time for our reward
Now you need us
Come and meet us
Nothing can stop us now
-
- Oh, whoa
I've got the music in me
Oh, whoa
Don't need
to hear a crowd
Cheering out my name
I didn't come here
seeking infamy or fame
The one and only thing
That I am here to bring
Is music,
is the music
Is the music
in my soul
Gonna break out
Set myself free, yeah
Let it all go, go
Just let it be, yeah
Find the music
in your heart
Let the music
make you start
To set yourself apart
So the Rainbooms want to turn this
into a real battle of the bands?
Then let's battle.
What we have in store
All we want and more
We will break on through
Now it's time
to finish you
Oh, oh...
Sunset Shimmer,
we need you.
You're never gonna
bring me down
You're never gonna
break this part of me
My friends are here
to bring me around
Not just singing
for popularity
We're here
to let you know
That we won't let it go
Our music is a bomb
and it's about to blow
And you can try to fight
But we have got the light
of friendship on our side
Got the music
in our hearts
We're here to blow
this thing apart
And together,
we will never
Be afraid of the dark
Here to sing our song
out loud
Get you dancing
with the crowd
As the music
of our friendship survives
Survives
Got the music
in our hearts
We're here to blow
this thing apart
And together,
we will never
Be afraid of the dark
Here to sing our song
out loud
Get you dancing
with the crowd
As the music
of our friendship survives
Survives, survives
We will be adored
Tell us that you want us
We won't be ignored
-
- It's time for our reward...
Guess that explains why these were
so special to them.
Without those pendants and the magic
you brought here from Equestria,
they're just three
harmless teenage girls.
Rainbooms rule!
That was amazing.
You may have vanquished
the Dazzlings,
but you will never have the amazing
showstopping ability
of the great
and powerful Trixie.
She's gone!
Oh, wait.
There she is.
Trixie's okay.
You know, Twilight is going back
to Equestria soon.
The Rainbooms
could really use
someone to help Fluttershy
on backup vocals.
I also play guitar.
We'll see.
Sure wish
you could stay longer.
Me, too, but I have
responsibilities
in Equestria
that I have to get back to.
Its citizens need me.
But now I can go through the portal
whenever I need to.
This isn't good-bye,
it's just good-bye till next time.
- Ready?
- Ready.
"Dear
Princess Twilight,
missing you already
and hope you'll be back soon.
Things are definitely looking up
for me here at Canterlot High,
but I know I still have a lot
to learn about friendship.
Hope you don't mind if I write to you
for advice when I need it.
Your friend,
Sunset Shimmer."
- You ready or what?
- Ready.
One, two, three, four.
Once upon a time
You came into my world
and made the stars align
Now I can see the signs
You pick me up
when I get down so I can shine
Shine like rainbows
Shine
like rainbows
Friends,
you are in my life
And you can count on me
to be there by your side
And when the music
comes alive
We sing our songs to
lift us up so we can shine
And the sound
that we hear in our hearts
Makes a crescendo
And the light that ignites
in the dark
It makes us all glow
And shine like rainbows
We shine like rainbows
Together we stand
As the rain
begins to fall
And holding
our heads up high
As the sun shines
through it all
And the sound
that we hear in our hearts
Makes a crescendo
And the light
that ignites in the dark
It makes us all glow
And shine like rainbows
We shine like rainbows
Shine like rainbows
We shine like rainbows
Shine like rainbows.
No doubt about it, Spike.
There's definitely something strange
going on at that school.
