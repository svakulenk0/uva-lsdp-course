Alice in Wonderland
How do you get to Wonderland
Over the hill or under land
Or just behind the tree
When clouds go rolling by
They roll away
and leave the sky
Where is the land
beyond the isles
That people cannot see
Where can it be
Where do stars go
Where is the crescent moon
They must be somewhere
In the sunny afternoon
Alice in Wonderland
Where is the path
to Wonderland
Over the hill
or here or there
I wonder where
"...And had been of late
much accustomed
"to usurpation
and conquest.
" Edwin and Morcar,
"the earls of Mercia
and Northumbria,
"declared for him.
"And even Stigand--"
Alice!
Hmm?
I'm listening.
"And even Stigand,
"the Archbishop
of Canterbury,
"agreed to meet
with William
"and offer him
the crown.
William's
conduct was--"
Alice!
Pay attention to
your history lesson.
How can one
pay attention
to a book
with no pictures?
There are many good books
in this world
without pictures.
In this world, perhaps.
But in my world,
the books will be
nothing but pictures.
Your world?
What nonsense.
Nonsense?
That's it, Dinah!
If l had
a world of my own,
everything
would be nonsense.
Nothing would
be what it is.
Everything would
be what it isn't.
What it is,
it wouldn't be,
and what it wouldn't be,
it would.
- You see?
- Meow.
In my world,
you wouldn't say "meow."
You'd say,
"Yes, Miss Alice."
Meow.
But you would.
You'd be
just like people.
And all the other
animals, too.
And all the other
animals, too.
In my world...
Cats and rabbits
Would reside
in fancy little houses
And be dressed in shoes
and hats and trousers
ln a world
of my own
All the flowers
Would have very
extra-special powers
They would sit
and talk to me for hours
When I'm lonely
ln a world
of my own
There'd be new birds
Lots of nice
and friendly
How-de-do birds
Everyone would have
a dozen blue birds
Within that world
of my own
I could listen
To a babbling brook
And hear a song
that I could understand
I keep wishing
It could be that way
Because my world
would be
A wonderland
Meow!
Meow!
Dinah, it's
just a rabbit
with a waistcoat
and a watch.
I'm late,
I'm late, I'm late!
This is curious.
What could a rabbit
be late for?
Sir!
I'm late, I'm late
For a very
important date
No time to say
" Hello." Good-bye
I'm late,
I'm late, I'm late
It must be important,
Iike a party
or something.
Mr. Rabbit, wait!
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no. I'm overdue
I'm really in a stew
No time to say
"Good-bye." Hello
I'm late,
I'm late, I'm late
My.
What a peculiar place
to have a party.
Meow.
You know,
we really shouldn't...
be doing this.
After all,
we haven't...
been invited.
And curiosity
often leads
to trouble!
Good-bye, Dinah.
Good-bye-e-e-e!
Oh!
Well, after this,
I shall think nothing--
of falling down stairs.
Oh!
Ah!
Oh!
Goodness.
What if l should fall
right through the center
of the ear-r-th
and come out
the other side
where people
walk upside down?
But that's silly.
Nobody--oh!
Oh, Mr. Rabbit!
Wait!
Please!
Curiouser and curiouser.
Ohh!
Oh!
I beg your pardon.
Quite all right.
Butyou did give me
quite a turn.
Rather good, what?
Doorknob...turn.
Please, sir.
One good turn
deserves another.
What can I do
for you?
I'm looking
for a white rabbit.
If you don't mind...
Oh.
There he is!
I must get through.
You're too big.
Simply impassable.
You mean
impossible.
No, impassable.
Nothing's impossible.
Try the bottle
on the table.
Table?
Read the directions,
and you'll be
directed
in the right
direction.
Hmm...
Better look first.
For if one drinks from
a bottle marked "poison,"
it's almost certain
to disagree with one.
Beg your pardon?
I was giving myself
some good advice.
But...
mmm...
tastes like...
cherry tart.
Custard.
Pineapple.
Roast turkey.
Goodness!
What did I do?
You almost went out
like a candle.
Look! I'm just
the right size.
Oh. No use.
I forgot
to tell you.
I'm locked.
Oh, no!
But of course,
you've got the key.
Key?
Don't tell me you've
left it up there?
Oh, dear.
Whatever will I do?
Try the box,
naturally.
Oh!
" Eat me."
All right.
Goodness knows
what this will do.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Hmpfh shmfrumph.
What did you say?
A little of that
went a long way.
I don't think
it's funny.
Now I shall
never get home.
Oh, come,
come now.
Crying
won't help.
I know,
but l..l..l
just can't stop.
Say,
this won't do.
It won't do
at all.
You!
You up there.
Stop!
Stop, I say!
Oh, look!
The bottle.
The bot--
Oh, dear.
I wish I hadn't
cried so much.
A sailor's life
is the life for me
How I love to sail
o'er the bounding sea
And I never never ever
do a thing about the weather
For the weather never ever
does a thing for me
Oh
A sailor's life
is the life for me
Tiddlee um pom pom
Deedle dum dum dee
And I never--
Ahoy!
Another nautical
expression.
Land ho, by Jove.
Where away, Dodo?
Dodo?
Three points
to starboard.
Pull away,
me hearties.
Have you in port
in no time.
Mr. Dodo!
Please! Please help me!
Pardon me,
but, uh...
would you mind
helping me, please?
Yoo hoo!
Yoo hoo!
Help me!
Please!
Help me!
Forward, backward,
inward, outward
Come and join
the chase
Nothing could be drier
than ajolly caucus race
Backward, forward,
outward, inward
Bottom to the top
Never a beginning
There can never
be a stop
To skipping,
hopping, tripping
Fancy free and gay
I started it tomorrow,
but will finish yesterday
Round and round
and round we go
Until forever more
Once we were behind,
but now we find we are
Forward, backward,
inward, outward
Come and join
the chase
Nothing could be drier
than ajolly caucus race
I say, you'll never
get dry that way.
Get dry?
You have to run
with the others.
But how can l--
Have you dry
in no time.
No one can get dry
this way.
Nonsense.
I'm dry already.
Yes, but--
All right, chaps,
Iook lively!
The white rabbit.
Mr. Rabbit!
Mr. Rabbit!
My goodness.
I'm late! I'm late!
I'll be back.
I'm late,
I'm late, I'm late!
Stop kicking
that mackerel.
Mr. Rabbit!
Oh, Mr. Rabbit!
Oh, dear.
I'm sure he came
this way.
Could he be hiding?
Hmm.
Not here.
I wonder...
No. I suppose
he must have--
Why, what peculiar
little figures.
Tweedle Dee
and Tweedle Dum.
Honk!
If you think we're waxworks,
you ought to pay.
If you think we're alive,
you ought to speak to us.
Beep!
Honk!
Beep!
Honk!
Beep!
Honk!
Beep!
Honk!
That's logic!
Well, it's been nice
meeting you.
Good-bye.
You're beginning
backwards.
The first thing
is to say...
" How do you do"
and shake hands
Shake hands
Shake hands
" How do you do"
and shake hands
State your name
and business
That's manners!
That's manners!
Really?
My name is Alice.
I'm following
a white rabbit.
You can't go yet.
The visit is
just started.
Sorry.
Like to play
hide-and-seek
or who's got
the button?
If you stay long enough,
we might battle.
That's very kind.
But I must be going.
Why?
Why?
I'm following
a white rabbit.
I'm curious to know
where he's going.
Oh, she's curious.
Tsk, tsk, tsk.
The oysters
were curious, too.
Aye. And you remember
what happened to them.
Poor things.
Poor things.
Why? What happened
to the oysters?
You wouldn't
be interested.
You're in too much
ofa hurry.
Perhaps, I could
spare a little time.
You could? Well...
Beep!
The walrusand
the carpenter.
Or the story
of the curious oysters.
Honk!
Beep! Beep!
Honk!
The sun was
shining on the sea
Shining
with all its might
He did his
very best to make
The billows
smooth and bright
And this was odd
because it was...
The middle
of the night
The walrus
and the carpenter
Were walking
close at hand
The beach was wide
from side to side
But much
too full of sand
Mr. Walrus,
said the carpenter
My brain
begins to perk
We'll sweep this clear
in 'alfa year
lf you don't mind
the work
Work!
Uh...brrrr.
The time has come
The walrus said--
To talk
of other things
Of shoes and ships
and sealing wax
And cabbages
and kings
And why the sea
is boiling hot
And whether
pigs have wings
Calloo, callay,
no work today
We're cabbages
and kings
Oh...oysters,
come and walk with us.
The day
is warm and bright.
A pleasant walk,
a pleasant talk
would be
a sheer delight.
Should we get hungry
on the way,
we'll stop
and have a bite.
A-hem.
But mother oyster
winked her eye
And shook
her heavy head
She knew too well
This was no time
to leave her oyster bed
The sea is nice.
Take my advice.
Stay right here.
Mum said.
Yes, yes,
of course...
Ha ha!
The time has come,
my little friends
To talk
of other things
Of shoes and ships
and sealing wax
Of cabbages
and kings
And why the sea
is boiling hot
And, uh...whether
pigs have wings, ho ho
Calloo, callay,
come run away
We're the cabbages
and kings
Uh, hummm...
well, now, uh...
Iet me see...
A loaf of bread
is what we chiefly need.
How about some
pepper, salt,
and vinegar?
Yes. Splendid idea.
Very good, indeed.
Now...
if you're ready,
oysters, dear...
Ha ha.
We'll begin
the feed!
Feed?
Feed?
Oh, yes, uh...
The time has come,
my little friends
To talk
of food and things
Of pepper corns
and mustard seed
And other
seasonings
We'll mix them
all together
ln a sauce that's
fit for kings
Calloo, callay,
we'll eat today
Like cabbages
And kings
I, uh...
I weep for you.
Oh, excuse me.
I deeply sympathize,
for I've enjoyed
your company
much more
than you realize.
Little oysters,
little oysters!
But answer
there came none.
And this was
scarcely odd because...
they'd been eaten,
everyone!
Mmm, well, uh...
Ha ha ha ha.
Mmm, uh...
The time has come--
We're cabbages
And kings
Honk!
Beep!
The end.
That was a sad story.
There's
a moral to it.
A good moral,
if you're an oyster.
It's been very nice.
Another recitation
entitled Father William!
First verse.
You are Old Father William,
the young man said
And your hair
has become very white
And yet you incessantly
stand on your head
Do you think at your age
it is right, is right?
Do you think
at your age it is right?
Well, in me youth,
Father William replied to his son
I'd do it again
and again and again
And I'd do it again
and again and again...
Now, I wonder
who lives here.
Mary Ann!
Where did
she put them ?
Mary Ann!
The rabbit!
Mary Ann!
No use! Can't wait!
I'm awfully late!
Oh, me, oh, my.
Oh, me, oh, my.
Excuse me.
I'm trying--
Mary Ann,
why are you out here ?
Mary Ann?
Don't just do something!
Stand there!
Get my gloves!
I'm late!
Late for what?
My gloves!
At once!
Goodness! I'll be taking
orders from Dinah next.
Hmm...
now, let me see.
If l were a rabbit,
where would I
keep gloves?
Oh, thank you.
Don't mind
if l do.
Ooh!
Oh, no, no!
Not again!
Oh! Mary Ann!
You see here,
Mary Ann.
Help!
Ooh! Woo! Ha!
No!
Help! Monster!
Help! Assistance!
Oh, dear.
A monster!
A monster, Dodo!
Dodo?
Steady, old chap.
Can't be as bad
as that.
My poor roof
and rafters!
There it is!
By Jove!
Jolly well is.
Well, do something!
Yes, indeed. Extraordinary
situation, but...
But what?
But I have a very
simple solution.
Thank goodness.
Simply pull it out
the chimney.
Pull it out!
Who, me?
Don't be ridiculous.
What we
need is a...
A lizard with a ladder!
Oh, Bill! Bill!
We need a lazard
with a lidder.
Can you help us?
At your service,
governor.
Have you ever been
down a chimney?
I've been down
more chimneys--
Excellent,
excellent.
Hop down and pull
that monster out.
Righto, governor.
Monster? Aah!
Oh, no!
Stop!
Oh, no!
Wait!
Steady, now!
Aah!
That's better.
You're passing up
a golden opportunity.
I am?
You can be famous.
I can?
In you go, now.
Tie your tail around
the monster's neck
and drag it out.
But...
but, governor--
Good luck, Bill.
Ah, ah, ah...
ah, ah, ah...
ah, ah, ah, ah, ah...
choo!
Well...
there goes Bill.
Poor Bill.
Uh...perhaps
we should try
a more energetic
remedy.
Yes!
Anything,
but hurry!
I propose
that we, uh...
Yes?
I propose
that we...
Ooh!
That's it!
We'll burn the house down!
What?
No!
Oh-ho...
Oh-ho...
Oh, we'll smoke
the blighter out
We'll put
the beast to rout
Some kindling,
a stick or two
Ah, this bit
ofrubbish ought to do
We'll smoke
the blighter out
We'll smoke
the monster out
No! Not my
beautiful birdhouse!
Oh, we'll roast
the blighter's toes
We'll toast
the bounder's nose
Just fetch that gate,
we'll make it clear
That monsters
aren't welcome here
Oh, me, oh, my.
Match.
Match?
Without
a single doubt
We'll smoke
the monster out
We'll smoke
the monster--
No!
My poor house
and furniture!
Dear,
this is serious.
I simply must--
Oh, a garden!
Perhaps if
I ate something,
it would make me
smaller.
Oow!
Help!
I must
eat something.
Not me! You...
you...you barbarian!
Help!
Monster!
Help!
Ah! I'm late!
I'm here!
I should be there!
Have a match?
Must go!
Good-bye!
I'm late!
Please wait!
Doyou
have a match?
No. Sorry.
Mr. Rabbit!
No cooperation.
No cooperation at all.
Can't have
monsters about.
Have to
carry on alone.
Wait. Please!
Just a minute!
Oh, dear.
I'll never catch him
while I'm this small.
Why...
curious butterflies.
You mean bread
and butterflies.
Of course--mmm?
Now, who do you suppose...
A horsefly.
I mean, uh...
a rocking horsefly.
Naturally.
I beg your pardon,
but did you...
That's nonsense.
Flowers can't talk.
But of course
we can talk, my dear.
If there's
anyone worth
talking to.
Or about.
Ha ha!
We sing, too.
You do?
Let's sing
TeIllt To the Tulips.
Or about
shy little violets.
Sing Lovely
Lily of the Valley.
She'd hate it.
Girls! We shall sing
Golden Afternoon.
That's about
all ofus.
Sound your "A", Lily.
La

La la la
Ah ah ah ah
Dum du dum dum
Poom
Ah-poom mm-hmm
poom oow poom poom
Ah-poom mm-hmm
poom oow oow oow
Little bread and butterflies
kiss the tulips
And the sun is like
a toy balloon
Oo-ooo
There are
get-up-in-the-morning glories
ln the golden afternoon
Oo-ooo
There are dizzy daffodils
on the hillside
Strings of violets
are all in tune
Tiger lilies
love the dandelions
ln the golden afternoon
The golden afternoon
There are
dog and caterpillars
And a copper centipede
Where the lazy daisies
Love the very
Peaceful life
They lead
You can learn a lot
ofthings from the flowers
For especially
in the month of June
Ah ah ah ah
There's a wealth
of happiness and romance
All
ln the golden afternoon
All in
the golden afternoon
The golden
Afternoon
You can learn
a lot ofthings
From the flowers
For especially
in the month of June
There's a wealth
of happiness
And romance
All in
the golden afternoon
Ah-ha
Ah
Oh, that was lovely!
Thank you,
my dear.
What garden
are you from?
I don't come
from any garden.
Maybe she's
a wildflower!
I'm not a wildflower.
What specie or genus
are you, my dear?
I suppose you'd call
me a genus humanus Alice.
Ever see an Alice with
a blossom like that?
Did you ever
see an Alice?
Did you notice
her petals?
What a peculiar
color.
And no fragrance.
Just look
at those stems!
Rather scrawny,
I'd say.
I think
she's pretty.
Quiet, Bud.
I'm not a flower!
Just as I suspected!
She's nothing
but a common mobile vulgaris.
Oh, no!
Oh, no!
A common what?
To be blunt--
a weed!
I'm not a weed!
She wouldn't admit it.
Can you imagine?
Goodness!
Don't go to seed here!
Go on, now!
Go!
We don't want weeds
in our bed!
Move along!
Toot!
Meoooow!
Arf!. Arf!. Arf!.
All right,
if that's how you feel.
If l were
my right size,
I could pick
each of you!
That'd
teach you.
Ha ha ha ha!
You can learn a lot
from the flowers.
Hmph! They could learn
a lot about manners.

Who...
are...
you?
Why, I hardly
know, sir.
I've changed so many times,
you see--
I do not see.
Explain yourself.
I can't explain
myself, sir,
because I'm not
myself, you know.
I do not know.
I can't be clearer.
It isn't
clear to me.
You?
Who are you?
Well, you ought
to tell me--
Who...
you are first.
Why?
Oh, dear. Everything
is so confusing.
It is not.
It is to me.
Why?
I can't remember
things as I used to.
Recite.
Hmm?
Oh! Yes, sir.
Um...
how doth the
little busy bee
improve each--
Stop!
That is not spoken
correcti-cally.
It goes...
how...
Ha ha ha ha.
A-hem.
How doth the little
crocodile
improve his shining tail
and pour the waters
ofthe Nile
on every golden scale?
How cheer--
How cheer--
A-hem!
Ha ha ha ha.
How cheerfully
he seems to grin.
How neatly
spreads his claws.
And welcomes
little fishes in
with gently smiling jaws.
I've never heard it
that way before.
I have improved it.
Well...
If you ask me--
You?
Who are you?
Ah-choo!
Oh!
You there!
Girl!
Wait!
Come back!
I have something
important to say!
Oh, dear.
I wonder what
he wants now.
Oh!
Well?
Keep your temper.
Is that all?
No.
Exacti-cally
what is your problem?
Well,
it's exactic--
Exactic--
It's precisely this.
I'd like
to be larger, sir.
Why?
Well, after all...
a wretched height.
I am exactically
three inches high,
and it's a very
good height indeed!
But I'm not used to it,
and you needn't...
shout!
Oh, dear.
I have some more
helpful hints.
One side makes
you grow taller.
One side ofwhat?
The other side
makes you grow shorter.
The other side
of what?
The mushroom,
of course!
Hmm.
One side will
make me grow...
But which is which?
Hmm.
After all that's
happened, l...
I wonder if l...
I don't care.
I'm tired of being
Yi! Yi! Yi! Yi!
Yi! Yi! Yi! Yi!
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!
Ah!
A serpent!
Help! Help!
A serpent! A serpent!
Please, please!
Off with you!
Shoo! Shoo!
Go away! Serpent!
But I'm not
a serpent!
Indeed?
Just what are you?
A little girl.
Little?
Ha! Little?
Ah ha ha ha ha!
Well, I am.
I mean, I was.
I supposeyou don't
eat eggs, either.
Yes, I do.
I knew it!
Serpent!
Serpeeeeeeeeent!
Oh, for goodness sake!
And the other side will...
The very idea!
Spend all my time
laying eggs for
serpents like her!
Ahhhhhhhh!
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!
Oh!
Goodness.
I wonder if l'll ever
get the knack ofit.
There. That's
much better.
Hmm. Better save these.
Now, let's see.
Where was l?
Hmm. I wonder which way
I ought to go.
'Twas...
Brillig and
the slithy toves
Did gyre and
gimbel in the wabe
All mimsy
Were the borogoves
And the momeraths
outgrabe
Now, where do you
suppose that...
Lose something?
Oh! Well, uh...
Ha ha ha.
I-l was...no...
I-l mean...
I-l was wondering...
That's all right.
One moment, please.
Ooh!
Second chorus.
'Twas brillig
And the slithy toves
Did gyre and
gimbel in the wabe
Why...why,
you're a cat.
A Cheshire cat.
All mimsy
Were the borogoves
Oh, wait.
Don't go, please!
There you are.
Third chorus.
I wanted to ask
which way
I ought to go.
Well, that depends...
on where...
you want to get to.
It really doesn't
matter, as long--
Then...it really
doesn't matter...
which way...you go.
Ah hah, hah hah
All mimsy
were the borogoves
And the momeraths
outgrabe
Oh, by the way...
if you'd really
like to know,
he went...that way.
Who did?
The white rabbit.
He did?
Did what?
Went that way?
Who did?
The white rabbit.
What rabbit?
Didn't you say...
Oh, dear!
Can you stand
on your head?
Oh!
However...
if l were looking
for a white rabbit...
I'd ask the Mad Hatter.
The Mad Hatter?
No, I don't--
Or...there's
the March Hare
in that direction.
Thank you.
I shall visit him.
Of course...
he's mad, too.
I don't want to
be with mad people.
Oh, you can't
help that.
Most everyone's
mad here.
Ha ha ha ha ha!
You may
have noticed
that I'm not
all there myself.
And the momeraths
outgrabe...
Goodness. If people
here are like that,
I must try not
to upset them.
How very curious.
lfthere are
no objections
Let it be unanimous
Oh, a very
merry unbirthday
A very merry
unbirthday
A very merry
unbirthday to us
A
Very merry
unbirthday to me
To who
Oh, you
A very merry
unbirthday to you
Who, me
Oh, me
Let's all
congratulate us
With another
cup of tea
A very merry
unbirthday
To...
You
No room!
No room!
No room!
No room!
But there's
plenty of room.
It's rude to sit
without being invited.
It's very, very
rude, indeed!
Very, very, very
rude, indeed.
I'm very sorry.
But I did enjoy
your singing.
You enjoyed
our singing?
Oh, what
a delightful child!
I'm so excited.
We never get
compliments.
You must have
a cup of tea!
Ah, yes, indeed.
You must have
a cup of tea.
I'm sorry I interrupted
your birthday party.
Birthday?
This is not
a birthday party!
Of course not.
This is
an unbirthday party.
Unbirthday?
I'm sorry.
I don't understand.
It's very simple.
No. An unbirthday...
if you have
a birthday, then...
you...
She doesn't know
what an unbirthday is.
How silly!
Ha ha ha ha!
Well, l...
I shall elucidate.
Now statistics prove
Prove that you've
one birthday
lmagine just one
birthday every year
Ah, but there are
Precisely why
we're gathered here to cheer
Then today's
my unbirthday, too.
It is?
What a small world.
In that case...
A very merry unbirthday
To me
Toyou
A very merry unbirthday
For me
Foryou
Blow
the candle out
And make your
wish come true
A very merry
unbirthday
Toyou
Twinkle, twinkle
little bat.
How I wonder
whatyou're at.
Up above
the world you fly,
Like a tea-tray
in the sky.
That was lovely.
And now, my dear,
you were saying
you were seeking...
Pardon me.
You were seeking
some information of some kind?
Yes. I'm looking
for--
Clean cup!
Clean cup!
Move down!
But I haven't
used my cup.
Clean cup,
move down
Would you like
more tea?
I haven't
had any yet,
So I can't take more.
You mean you
can't take less.
You can always take
more than nothing.
But--
And now, my dear,
Something seems
to be troubling you.
Tell us
all about it.
Start at
the beginning.
Yes, yes.
And when you
come to the end...
stop!
It started while
I was sitting
on the riverbank
with Dinah.
Very interesting.
Who's Dinah?
Dinah's my cat.
Cat?
Cat!
What's got
into him?
Catch him!
Help! Help!
Stop him!
Get thejam!
Put it
on his nose!
C-c-cat...
Ohh...
Oh, my goodness.
Those are the things
that upset me.
See the trouble
you've started?
I didn't think--
If you don't think,
you shouldn't talk.
Clean cup,
move down!
But--
Move down,
move down
Move down
Now, dear,
you were saying?
Oh, yes.
I was sitting
on the riverbank,
with, uh...
you know who.
I do?
I mean my c-a-t.
Tea!
Just a half
a cup.
Come, come, my dear,
don't you care
for tea?
I'm very fond
of tea.
You could
at least make polite conversation.
I've been
trying to ask--
I have an
excellent idea.
Let's change
the subject.
Why is a raven
like a writing desk?
Riddles?
Let me see, now.
Why is a raven
Iike
a writing desk?
I beg your pardon?
Why is a raven
like a writing desk?
What?
Careful.
She's mad.
It's your
silly riddle.
You just said--
Don't get excited.
A cup of tea?
A cup of tea,
indeed!
I haven't time.
The time!
Who's got the time?
No time,
no time, no time.
Hello. Good-bye.
I'm late! I'm late!
The white rabbit!
I'm so late.
I'm so very late.
No wonder you're late.
This clock is exactly
two days slow.
Two days slow?
Of course you're late.
My goodness.
We'll have
to look into this.
A-ha!
I see what's wrong.
This watch
is full of wheels.
Oh, my poor watch.
Oh, my wheels
and springs.
But-but-but-but...
Butter! Of course!
It needs butter.
Butter!
Butter!
But-butter?
Butter.
Thank you. Butter.
That's fine.
No, no, no.
You'll get
crumbs in it!
This is good butter.
Tea?
I never
thought of tea.
No! Not tea!
Sugar?
Sugar. Two spoons.
Two spoons.
Thank you.
Be careful!
Jam! I forgot
all about jam.
Mustard!
Mustard, yes.
Mustard?
Don't let's
be silly.
Lemon.
That's different.
That should do it.
Look at that!
Goodness.
Dear.
Mad watch.
Mad watch!
There's only one way
to stop a mad watch.
Two days slow,
that's what it is.
Oh, my watch.
It was?
It was an
unbirthday present.
In that case...
A very merry unbirthday
To
You
Mr. Rabbit!
Oh, Mr. Rabbit!
Now where did he go?
...to us,
to us
A very merry
unbirthday
To us, to us
Of all the silly nonsense.
This is the stupidest
tea party ever.
I've had
enough nonsense.
I'm going home.
Straight home.
That rabbit.
Who cares where
he's going anyway?
Ifit hadn't
been for him, l--
"TulgeyWood."
Hmm. Curious.
I don't remember this.
Now, let me see...
Oh!
No, no, please.
No more nonsense.
Now, if l came
this way,
I should go back
this way.
Honk!
I beg your pardon.
Goodness.
When I get home,
I shall write a book
about this place.
If l ever do get home.
Oh, excuse me!
Could one of you
tell me--
Uh...
never mind.
Caw! Caw!
Oh, dear.
It's getting
dreadfully dark,
and nothing
looks familiar.
I'll be glad
to get out of--oh!
Hoo.
Hoo hoo.
Hoo.
It would be nice
if something made
sense for a change.
Oh.
The momeraths?
A path!
Oh, thank goodness.
I knew I'd find one
sooner or later.
Ifl hurry,
I might be home
in time for tea.
Won't Dinah
be happy to see me.
I just can't
wait till l--
Oh, dear.
Now I shall
never get out.
Well...
when one's lost,
I suppose
it's good advice
to stay
where you are
until someone
finds you.
But...but who'd ever think
to look for me here?
Good advice.
If l'd listened
earlier,
I wouldn't be here.
But that's just
the trouble with me.
I give myself
very good advice...
But I very seldom
follow it
That explains
The trouble
that I'm always in
Be patient
ls very good advice
But the waiting
makes me curious
And I'd love
the change
Should something
strange
Begin
Well...
I went along
my merryway
and I never
stopped to reason.
I should have known
there'd be
a price to pay
someday.
Someday.
I give myself...
very good advice,
but I very seldom
follow it.
Will I ever learn
to do the things
I should?
WiIl l ever learn
Learn to do
the things
I should?
Hmm hmm hmm
hmm hmm
And the momeraths
out grabe
Oh, Cheshire cat,
it's you!
Whom did you expect?
The white rabbit,
perchance?
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm through
with rabbits.
I want to go home,
but I can't
find my way.
That's because
you have no way.
All ways here,
you see,
are the queen's
ways.
But I've never
met any queen.
You haven't?
You haven't?
Oh, but you must!
She'll be mad
about you.
Simply mad.
And the momeraths
outgrabe
Please! Please!
How can I find her?
Well,
some go this way,
some go that way,
but as for me,
myself, personally,
I prefer
the shortcut.
Oh!
Da dee dee da
da da
Doodle dee do
dee do dee do

Painting
the roses red
We're painting
the roses red
We dare not stop
or waste a drop
So let the paint
be spread
We're painting
the roses red
We're painting
the roses red
Oh-h-h-h
Painting
the roses red
And many a tear
we shed
Because we know
They'll cease
to grow
ln fact, they'll
soon be dead
Oh!
Oh!
And yet,
we go ahead
Painting
the roses red
Red, red, red, red
Red, red, red, red
Painting
the roses red
We're painting
the roses red
Oh, pardon me,
but, Mr. Three
Why must you
paint them red?
Huh?
Huh?
Huh?
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
The fact is, Miss,
we planted white roses
by mistake.
And...
The queen,
she likes them red
lf she saw
white instead
She'd raise
a fuss
And each of us
Would quickly
lose his head
Goodness.
Since this is
the thought we dread
We're painting
the roses red
Oh, dear.
Let me help you.
Painting
the roses red
We're painting
the roses red
Don't tell the queen
what you have seen
Or say
that's what we said
But we're painting
the roses red
Yes, painting
the roses red
Not pink.
Not green.
Not aquamarine.
We're painting
the roses red
The queen!
The queen!
The queen!
The queen!
The queen!
Cards, halt!
Count off!.
The rabbit.
Her...
Her lmperial Highness,
Her...
Her Grace,
Her Excellency,
Her Royal Majesty,
the Queen of Hearts!
Yea!
Hooray!
Yea!
And the king.
Hooray!
Hmmm!
Who's been painting
my roses red?
Who's been painting
my roses red?
Who dares to taint
with vulgar paint
The royal flower bed?
For painting
my roses red
Someone will
lose his head
Your Majesty,
please.
It's his fault.
Not me,
Your Grace.
The ace!
Two!
Not me!
The trey.
That's enough!
Off with their heads!
Yea!
Yea!
Hooray!
They're going
to lose their heads
For painting
the roses red
It serves them right,
they planted white
And roses
should be red
Oh, they're going
to lose their heads
Silence!
Oh, please, please.
They were only--
And who is this?
Let me see, my dear.
It isn't a heart.
Is it a club?
It's a little girl.
Yes, and
I was hoping--
Look up.
Speak nicely.
And don't twiddle
your fingers!
Turn out your toes.
Curtsy.
Open your mouth wider,
and always say,
"Yes, Your Majesty!"
Yes, Your Majesty!
Now, where
do you come from?
Where are you going?
I've lost my way.
Your way?
All ways here
are my ways!
Yes, I know.
I was thinking--
Curtsy while
you're thinking.
It saves time.
Yes, but I
wanted to ask--
I'll ask
the questions!
Do you
play croquet?
Why, yes,
Your Majesty.
Then let
the game begin!
To your places.
Hurry, hurry!
Shuffle deck!
Cards, cut!
Deal cards!
Cards, halt!
Silence!
Yea!
Yea!
Off with his head!
Off with his head.
You heard
what she said.
You're next,
my dear.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
Ohh.
Stop!
Of all the
impossible...
You want us both
to lose our heads?
Well, I don't.
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
Huh?
Ow!
La la la
da da dum
La la la hmm
How are
you getting on?
Not at all.
Beg pardon?
I said, not at all.
Who are you
talking to?
A cat, Your Majesty.
Where?
There!
Oh.
There he is!
I warn you, child.
If l lose my temper,
you lose your head!
We could make her
really angry.
Shall we try?
Oh, no, no!
It's loads of fun.
No, no, stop!
Oh, no!
My fur and whiskers!
Oh, dear!
Save the queen!
Someone's head
will roll for this!
Yours!
Off with her--
Couldn't she
have a trial?
Huh?
First?
Trial?
Well, just
a little trial?
Hmm?
Hmm...
Very well then.
Let the trial begin!
Your Majesty...
members of the jury,
Ioyal subjects...
A-hem.
and the king.
The prisoner is charged
with enticing Her Majesty
into a game of croquet,
and there by will fully
teasing, tormenting,
and annoying
our beloved--
Never mind that!
Get to where
I lose my temper.
... there by causing the
queen to lose her temper.
Now, are you ready
for your sentence?
There must
be a verdict first.
Sentence first!
Verdict afterward.
But that way isn't--
All ways are...
Your ways,
Your Majesty.
Yes, my child.
Off with her--
Consider, we've
called no witnesses.
Couldn't we hear
one or two? Huh?
Oh, very well,
but get on with it!
First witness.
Call the first witness.
The March Hare.
What do you
know about this?
Nothing.
Nothing whatever?
Nothing
whatever!
That's very important!
Jury, write that down.
" Unimportant,"
Your Majesty means.
Silence!
Next witness.
The dormouse.
Well--
Shh!
What have
you to say?
Twinkle, twinkle,
little bat.
How I wonder...
That's the most important
evidence we've heard yet.
Write that down!
Twinkle, twinkle.
Twinkle, twinkle.
Twinkle, twinkle.
What next?
The Mad Hatter.
Oh!
Off with your hat!
Oh, my.
Where were you
when this happened?
I was home
drinking tea.
Today is
my unbirthday.
Why, today is
your unbirthday, too.
It is?
It is?
It is?
A very merry
unbirthday
To me?
Oh, no.
A very merry
unbirthday
For me?
For you
Now blow the candle
out, my dear
And make
your wish come true
A very merry
unbirthday
To you
Oh! Your Majesty.
Yes, my dear?
There he is now.
Huh? What? Who?
The Cheshire cat.
Cat!
Cat!
Cat!
Oh, this
is terrible.
Stop him!
Somebody help me!
Catch him!
The jam!
The jam!
By order of the king!
Let me have it!
Somebody's head is
going to roll for this!
A-ha!
The mushroom.
Off with her--
Pooh. I'm not
afraid of you.
You're nothing but
a pack of cards.
Rule 42--persons
more than a mile high
must leave
the court immediately.
I'm not a mile high.
I'm not leaving.
Sorry. Rule 42,
you know.
And as for you,
Your Majesty.
Your Majesty,
indeed.
Why, you're
not a queen.
You're just
a fat, pompous,
bad-tempered
old ty--
tyrant.
And, uh, what were
you saying, my dear?
She simply said
you're a fat, pompous,
bad-tempered
old tyrant!
Off with her head!
You heard what
Her Majesty said!
Off with her head!
Forward, backward,
inward, outward
Here we go again
No one ever loses
And no one
can ever win
Backward, forward,
outward, inward
Bottom to the top...
Off with her head!
You can't leave
without having some tea.
I can't stop now.
You must join us
in a cup of tea.
Off with her head!
Mr. Caterpillar,
what will I do?
Who are you?
There she goes!
Don't let
her get away!
Off with her head!
Ohh!
Still locked,
you know.
The queen.
I must get out.
But you are outside.
What?
See for yourself.
Why...
why, that's me!
I'm asleep.
Don't let her
get away!
Off with her head!
Alice, wake up.
Alice!
Please
wake up, Alice.
Alice! Alice!
Alice!
Alice! Alice!
Will you pay attention
and recite your lesson?
Hmm? Oh.
How doth
the little crocodile
improve
his shining tail
and pour
the waters of--
Alice, what are
you talking about?
Oh, I'm sorry.
You see,
the caterpillar said--
Caterpillar?
Oh, for goodness sake.
Alice, l--
Oh, well.
Come along.
It's time for tea.

Over the hill
Or here or there
I wonder where

How do you get

Over the hill

Or just behind the tree?

Where is the path
