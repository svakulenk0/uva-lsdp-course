Sir loan from AlG Federal Government
gets it on 79.9 percent stake.
l'll take that.
Hello.
Ya. Will do.
AG corporation at 1 1 .8
Okay, sure.
l will call you back.
Akash.
Akash.
There was a call from the bank.
Our loan has been sanctioned.
Yes, we're buying Ellen
Steel company. - What?
Why?
lt's a small loan, for
around 1-1 .5 million dollars.
Ellen Steel is a dead company.
We'll make our clients
invest their money in it.
Which will increase
its stock value?
And if the stock value increases..
..so will the profit.
- No, no, that's not ourjob.
Taking loans is not
what we do.. Akash?
Chill Dude
Sir, can you spare me some change.
''ls the season to be jolly..''
'l am not responsible
for this crash Mr. Lee'
'Sir, please don't
raise your voice on me.'
'What happened when you
made 150% profit last year? '
'Fine, l don't need
you to do business.'
'l will survive this.'
'Akash.'
'The market has crashed.'
'lts over man. it
just moved too fast.'
'There was a call from the bank.'
'Yeah, we'll payback their loan.'
'They aren't going
to lose their money.'
'Why did you do this? '
'Listen, all of you knew
that l was taking a loan.'
'That's a Lie.'
'You took our
signatures for the loan..
..telling us that it was
for 1 million dollars.'
'And went ahead and took
a loan of 12 million.'
'What, 12 million? '
'Yes.. if that company
had done well
'l wasn't going to be the
only one to profit from it'
'We're all equal partners.'
'Would you guys have agreed..
..if l had said it was
a loan of 12 million? '
'All of you.. '
'All of you think small.'
You think, it was easy
to make this big office?
'l didn't know the
market would crash.'
So, you cheated us.
'You were in a hurry to
make it big, isn't it? '
'You wanted to win every race.'
We don't want to come first.
Our dreams aren't as big as yours
'What do you'll want to do? '
'Shut down the company.'
'Sell the office!
- Akash, please.'
'Try to understand.
- not there'
'All of you were losers.'
'All of you were losers!
- Akash, please'
'Go on.. let me see what
you'll are capable of without me.'
'Where will we go? '
'How will we repay the loan? '
Tell me how will we pay it back?
- Gaurav.
Where will we go and how will
we repay it? - Gaurav, please.
How will we repay
the loan now, tell me
How?
What will we do without you?
Your mom and dad live
without you as well.
You could neither be a
good son, nor a good friend.
What did you earn?
Money.
Now you don't even have that.
Forget it.
Forget it.
We're losers.
Yes.
But today.. you're the loser.
And the suicide
rate has risen to 27..
A 48year old man committed
suicide today..
..by jumping off his
office building.
lt seems he was everything.
l am not responsible for this crash.
Market, there's crash.
How did l know that
the market would crash?
Die.
Should l push you?
What else?
You've been standing
there for so long.
Actually no. Because
that will amount to murder.
No, no, l don't think so.
Please continue, jump jump
You know.. when you want
to do something like this..
..you shouldn't think.
Just do it.
Are you a suicide consultant?
lts common sense, man.
When l am slightly drunk..
l talk a lot.
Jabberjabberjabberjabber
Actually, in real
life l am very quiet.
Like really quiet.
But wait.. this is real life.
Sorry. l am sorry.
Concentrate.
Quiet.
Continue, jump jump
You know.. when l was really young.
Really young.
l never liked drinking medicine.
My mother would say to
me ''Close your eyes..''
''..count to three and drink it''.
Just..
So try that.
Okay, so l am also done.
Boy.
One.
Two.
Three.
Get off the bridge now!
Oh no! Coast guard.
Oh no.
God!
Alright, break it up you two, get
off the bridge, the party is over.
Get off the bridge now. Come on.
'l'll elope with you on this.'
'l am at the Hilton
and the room number.. '
'Last night l did the same thing..'
l found out about your accident.
l've come alone
No one else was ready to see you.
Then why are you here?
The loan you..
The loan we took, has been
sorted out with the bank
We are dissolving
the company's assets.
We've also found a
buyer for the office.
And we'll repay the rest by
selling our personal belongings.
The bank has
summoned us on the 30th.
Everyone.
Since you are the guarantor..
..it is important for
you to be there, Akash.
Akash, l know that the
bank has seized your house.
But even after what has happened..
..you can still live with us.
For as long as you want.
Really.
Please.
Be there on the 30th.
For once, Do something for others.
What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?
Oh God.
Why are you following me?
l can't help it, you're
so attractive you know
What happened to you?
l tried to jump from the bridge
after you and the police left..
..and fell down.
And that's all that
happened to you?
l fell on the bridge not
from the bridge. l was so drunk.
Did you really want to die?
- No, l was sightseeing.
What happened to you?
l tried again as well.
Jumped in front of a car.
And you failed as well.
So.. are you going to try again?
Hmm.. You too?
What are you doing? Just..
They'll think that we're escaping..
..from the mental
asylum in these clothes.
One more thing.
l've no interest in you.
Zilch.
Get that straight.
l don't know if l
should be relieved..
..or then begin to wonder why
you aren't interested in me?
Not that l want you to
be interested in me.
lf you know what l mean?
What am l doing with you?
Hey.
These scrubs look so funny
from the back, isn't it?
Whatever.
l am Kiara.
- Akash.
So.. what is your plan?
- Listen, please leave me alone.
You know, you are very rude
But, l am still asking you.
Can we do this together?
This isn't a game of double
tennis that we can do together
l'm just saying that because..
..l want to make sure it happens.
l've been very dependant in life.
l've always needed.. a push.
So please.
Well.. it's strange, but.. fine.
How do you want to do it?
We can go to my house.
- What?
l am not inviting you for coffee.
Whatever.
We can go to your house as well.
l don't have a house.
Stop. Stop. Stop. Here.
Come on.
- This way?
l never have my house keys.
After you.
- Oh no.
You're very smart. l know why
you want to climb up after me.
Come on, l am cold.
- Oh please.
Okay.
Can you push me a little bit?
- With pleasure.
Lights on. Music on.
What the hell.
l hate this song.
Excuse me.
What are you doing?
Making place to sit.
No need to get.. too comfortable.
You're not here to stay.
Let's do what we have to.
- What?
l know, l know.
We've ropes.
We can hang ourselves.
These sprinklers won't be
able to take your weight.
You know you're..
- Do you have plastic wrap?
What will we do with plastic wrap?
- Do you have it?
Okay. Here.
Asphyxiation.
- As.. What?
Suffocation.
lt's very effective.
You, first take this and
wrap it tightly around my face.
Then l'll wrap it around your's.
Then, when the oxygen stops reaching
our brains, in a few minutes..
..it will stop working.
Let's start.
- Ya.
Okay.
Your face is too long.
Can you breathe?
No?
Okay.
Alright.
Now my turn.
Come on.
Alright.
Start already!
Oh my, God. You cheat.
You knew it.. you knew that
you wouldn't be able to help me.
l won't let you die.
You will die and l
will be the murderer.
ls it my fault?
You blindfolded my eyes,
how could l see?
Couldn't you tell me before?
lf you had died,
l would've been jailed.
This is so not going to work.
Oh my, God.
l have an idea.
There are just three left.
Okay.
May l?
- Okay.
Paper.
- Paper.
Paper.
- Paper, quickly.
Paper. Paper. Paper.
- Quickly Kiara.
More paper? l'll get it.
More paper. More paper. More paper.
More paper. - More paper.
ls the gas on? ls the gas on?
The gas is on.
Kiara.
- Yes.
When did you last pay your bill?
- Which bill?
Your gas bill.
Your gas connection has been
cut off for the past 2 months
l have never cooked.
How was l supposed to know?
Look, l don't know if
you think this is a joke..
But for me, it isn't
lf you got hold of me
..just to get rid of your loneliness,
then go pick someone else up.
Go to any bar, l'm sure
you'll find someone there.
Butjust leave me alone.
Look, l am..
l am sorry.
l think l know why
this is happening.
Last night we met on the bridge.
Both of us.
But the coast guard arrived.
We then tried separately,
but failed.
Then we met in the hospital.
Strangely again.. we decided
to commit suicide together.
We came home. Tried twice.
But failed again.
So many attempts in
one day, but all failed.
Why?
Do you believe in signs?
What rubbish is this?
lt's just that you
don't want to die.
l have tried just as
hard as you have, Akash.
Maybe you or me have
something left to do in life?
'The bank has
called us on the 30th.'
'For the first time.. do
something for others.'
Okay fine.
Then explain to me
why we are still alive.
'Since you are the guarantor.. '
'.. it is very important
for you to be there, Akash.'
lts rubbish.
lts nonsense, l don't
believe in all this.
Maybe.. maybe you're right.
Let's try again.
Let's try your idea.
And this time we'll be careful.
l am telling you, Akash.
So many signs.
There has to be a reason..
something.. that is stopping us.
Should we take some time?
Two days? Four days?
What's the date today?
Seventh.. eighth November..
- 1 1th December.
Yes, right.
Then 31st December.
Means.. 1 1 , 12, 13, 14..
- 20days.
- lts 20days.
Right.
So 31st December.
New Year's night.
New Year's night.
At 12o'clock.
We'll jump from that bridge.
lts a pact.
But what will we
do in these 20days?
Things to do before you die.
Everyone boasts of things that
they wish to do before they die..
But never end up doing them.
Anything.
Fun, spontaneous, adventurous.
Everyone does it
to enjoy their life.
We'll do it to die!
No, its all nonsense.
l can't do this.
You could neither be a
good son, nor a good friend.
'Akash its over man,
itjust moved too fast.'
'You were always in a hurry
to make it big, weren't you? '
'You wanted to win every race.'
'Shut down the company.'
'Sell the office! '
'All of you were losers.'
'All of you were losers! '
'Where will we go? How
will we repay the loan? '
Tell me, how will we pay it back? '
EROS
So l guess, new year's night
l guess.
''Close your eyes when you
don't see your destination.''
''When you close your eyes and
seek you find the path to God.''
''Change your own fate.''
''Have courage and move ahead.''
''My footprints will
show you the way.''
''You're unaware that
God's all around you.''
''You're unaware that
God's all around you.''
''You're unaware that
God's all around you.''
''You're unaware that
God's all around you.''
''You're unaware that
God's all around you.''
''You're unaware that
God's all around you.''
You can't report four
hours late for work.
This is completely ridiculous.
You can'tjust walk-in
whenever you feel like.
You know what, you are fired.
''Take a look at yourself.''
''Why did you give-in to
the situation and give up.''
l was going to quit anyway.
''Your courage can
change your destiny.''
''Fill your world with
the colour of your dreams.''
''l am always with you.''
''So what if the sun's setting.''
''You'll find my threshold
when the darkness sets in.''
''And that is where you'll
find new hope once again.'
''You're unaware that
God's all around you.''
''You're unaware that
God's all around you.''
''You're unaware that
God's all around you.''
''You're unaware that
God's all around you.''
''You're unaware that
God's all around you.''
''You're unaware that
God's all around you.''
But why me first?
Because knowing you..
..you must have a strange,
complicated wish.
Or you might not have a wish at all
No, no, of course l do.
Really? Then tell me.
Take your time.
There's no hurry.
Come on.
Have you done everything?
lsn't there anything that
you wanted to do..
..but didn't get the chance to..
..or left it for later
l mean.. there's
got to be something.
There's one thing actually.
- Finally?
Tell me.
Can l.. get a beer?
And that's your wish?
l need the beer so that.. l
can tell you what my wish is?
That's nice.
This seems like it's going
to be a really good wish.
Here.
So.. l thought l'll wait.
You know for.. for the right girl.
Kiara!
What?
- You were sleeping.
No. No, l wasn't sleeping at all.
How could l sleep..
When l was
listening very carefully..
To everything that you didn't say.
Seriously.
l am a virgin.
Move.
What did you say?
- l have never..
You know..
l have never done it
l never got the time.
First l focused on
studies and then my job.
And it wasn't like l
didn't have my opportunities..
lts just that l was
waiting for the right girl.
What? What is so funny?
You're talking like
a 15year old girl.
ln fact.. even 15year old
girls don't talk like that here..
lf l had a 15year old daughter
and she didn't talk like this..
..l'd break her legs
l am sure.
But to have a 15year old daughter,
you have to first be a father.
And to be a father.. you have to..
- Yes, l know.
Okay.
But you're a lucky guy.
Because tomorrow's the night.
Where, ladies and gentlemen..
..a wish, a dream will be fulfilled.
A wish will come true.
Akash. Blush.
Blush. Akash.
Are you serious?
Yeah.. lsn't she gorgeous?
- Gorgeous?
She'll feel bad.
She's very sensitive.
She'll feel bad?
- Yes.
Hi, baby, did you miss me
because l missed you too.
You missed me my
blushy-wushy googly-poogly.
Yeah.
Does she work? or are we
just here to pay her a visit?
l know, l know.
He can be a pain but
try to manage tonight.
The party starts now, baby.
What are we doing here, Kiara?
We've got to fulfil
your last wish, remember?
Peshto.
How are you?
- Oh my, God. How have you been?
When did you arrive?
You didn't even call.
l know, l was slightly busy.
Why do girls
always meet each other..
..like they've been just been
let out of the mental asylum.
who is he?
That..
- Hi, Akash.
Akash. Oh, the virgin.
lsn't it cute, Sam?
Does everyone in this
club know this? - Peshto.
Not really..
- Kiara. Sam. - Sam, Kiara. - Hi.
Hi.
- Really nice to meet you.
Hi.
- Pleasure to meet you.
Darling, l got to take this.
- Okay.
God.
- So, did you like Sam?
So cute, quite yum, l like him.
- l know.
lsn't he just.. - You do
know that he's married, right?
What?
- What?
No.
l knew it.
He's talking to his wife right now
l can lip-read.
You'll learn to too, if you work
in the stock market long enough.
He's telling her that he is out
entertaining some Chinese clients
But he was going to have
dinner with me at Lobo tonight.
There ain't no Lobo tonight,
my darling.
He's going back home.
Darling, l got to go. Some
problem with the shipment, alright.
Bye. Take care.
- Bye.
Bye, guys.
- Bye. Pleasure meeting you.
C'mon Stay back.
- l've to go.
No, stay back.
- l've to go.
What about the party?
- Work. - You..
Work! Bye.
Screw it.
Anyway, he was quite boring.
And there are so
many hot guys in here.
l'll see you guys later.
But listen..
- You guys have fun.
And you.. you're not too bad.
Bye.
- Bye.
Come on.. Let's hit the bar.
Excuse me. Sorry.
Can l have two large jacks, please?
Nice
So this, my friend,
is your playground..
New York is officially the
land of the single ladies.
But first, you'll have to
loosen up a little. Just..
l know what, have a drink.
Finish, finish, down, down, finish.
Kiara.
Now we're talking!
Keep your hand on the bar.
Just one hand.
Now Lean.
Like that.
Now, look around.
Look all around.
Please, don't stare like a despo.
Smooth. Just like.. look around.
Scan the place.
Nice.
Now pout.
Slightly. My god!
Okay. Cute.
Okay, so you're ready for the kill.
Now.. imagine that a very sexy,
hot girl is standing next to you.
Just imagine me, Now just hit on me
Can l get you a drink?
- Why?
Are you a waiter?
No, thanks.
Can l buy you a drink?
- Much better.
Why should l let you buy me a drink?
Because l've been
noticing you for so long..
Please. That's the
tackiest pick-up line ever
l've been noticing you for so long.
l can buy my own drink.
So buy me a drink.
Cheapo.
So can l make you a drink?
Nice. Now that l like.
Hi, l am Akash.
Kiara.
- Unusual name.
Like me.
- Yeah.
l like you.
Nice.. Continue.
We've got news.. the
enemy has advanced.
Their men are moving forward.
They've captured most of our men.
We don't have much time
But what will happen
if they find you, Gopal?
There's nothing l can do.
Radha, l will have to stay back.
For my people.
Till the end.
You will have to leave.
- But what about us?
All those dreams, those promises?
Tell me.
We have just this night.
This night.
This moment.
You're good.
Okay.
l am starting to get to
know you a little too well..
..and l am not liking it.
- Why?
You were better off, as a stranger.

Hey, thanks.
Congrats.
Your first last wish
has been fulfilled.
Cheers.
l couldn't do it.
- Why?
Are you gay?
- No, idiot.
Don't call me an idiot.
Firstly, l try to
help you, and then..
lt's just that l couldn't do it.
You should've told me earlier.
We could've seen a doctor.
Listen, it's a very common problem
Listen, when l say l can't do it..
..l mean with a stranger,
having paid her money
ls it so difficult to understand?
Look at me
You think l didn't
have any girlfriends..
or that l didn't get opportunities.
lt's just that.. l
never felt it was right.
l wanted to wait.. to fall in love.
l know it's stupid. But
that's just the way it is
Oh so basically
you've never been in love.
So that's your wish.
Oh, dude.
That's a very
difficult wish to fulfil.
But.. Love isn't easy..
Oh no, just a minute.
l've got an original one.
What wish is one that
can be easily obtained.
What wish is one that
can be easily obtained.
Where there is no
struggle in fulfilling it.
Which once attained,
should feel like an achievement
Or else, life just goes by.
Thank you. Thank you.
That was very bad.
Oh, God. Come on.
You've got only 19 days..
to fall in love.
Hey, the car is this way.
Are you kidding me?
l don't drink and drive.
Okay, l'll drive.
- Blush!
No way. Only l drive her.
Come on, we're walking.
So the other day..
- Sorry.
Go ahead.
- No, you were saying something.
Just that.. we've decided to
live together for 20days.
And we don't even know..
..why we met on the
bridge that night.
Go on.
Stock market crash.
So you lost everything?
And your family?
My parents got divorced
when l was eight years old.
They kept fighting
even after the divorce.
My grandfather rescued me,
and brought me here
He educated me, sent me here.
He passed away in 2001 .
And since then l am alone.
Where are your parents now?
- l.. don't know.
What do you mean,
you don't know?
You don't even talk to them?
Well, neither do they.
So what, Akash?
Did you even try?
Oh my, God.
Say it, i don't care, l didn't
have time, blah, blah, blah.
l don't understand
today's generation..
And you took your
parent's permission..
..before committing suicide,
isn't it?
You care a lot for them, don't you?
So..
- What?
Your turn.
- Oh look, we're home.
Kiara, where are you going?
Come on.
l lived in San
Francisco with my family
Kunal and my family had known
each other for a really long time.
Especially since we had
migrated from lndia together
And that day, as usual
Kunal forgot my birthday.
l had gotten used to it.
But still used to get angry on him.
He was used to this anger.
Yeah, dad?
Oh, Kunal hasn't called yet.
- Goodnight, dad.
Goodnight, baby.
l've been trying to
call you all day..
lt either gets directed to voicemail
or you just don't answer it.
Okay, fine.
l thought of calling you
And it's you that always says
''lt's the thought that counts''.
l really thought of calling you.
Kiara, it's your birthday.
Be nice to people. Smile.
lt's my birthday, and l
should be nice to other people?
Yes, let's go now.
Come on, come on that's enough now.
l've got something to show you.
Happy birthday to you.
Happy birthday to you.
Look at her, isn't she gorgeous?
- You like her?
Of course, Kunal.
- lsn't it?
You're buying a gift for
yourself on my birthday.
l mean how sweet is that.
But, you do this every year.
Camera. Electric guitar.
Home theatre system.
- Enough.
PS3. And now this bike,
Which is for me.
All your gifts are for me.
Thanks so much Kunal,
l am so touched.
l bought the camera to
click your photographs..
And the home theatre, was
for us to watch movies together
And the guitar?
That was to compose songs for you
And the PS3?
- PS3?
OK fine, that's one thing,
that l bought for myself.
But this.. is for you to sit on.
And you know what.. we
will run away on this
Come on.
Hey.
Hey, hi babe.
- Hi.
So this is it.
Fourteen days until the wedding..
..and l see what the problem is.
Your living room is your bedroom.
And the bedroom?
- ls more like a storeroom.
Hey, babe, just pass me a beer.
- Yes.
l'll be right back.
Hey, would you like a beer?
- No, thank you
Maybe a glass of wine?
Or.. a cosmo?
l don't drink at work.
But here's my card.
Give me a call at night.
l'll drink anything.
Okay, okay, break it up you two.
Emanuel is a dream worker,
aren't you?
Honey, l am your fairy Godmother.
We're going to transform
this place. - Perfect.
He really is a fairy
Cheers.
Be nice.
- Bye, Emanuel.
Okay,
- The DVD collection.
We'll talk later.
And anyway, l am feeling sleepy.
What are you doing?
- lts called cleaning.
You know, cleaning.
- No, l don't know.
And l don't want to know.
You know, for the first time..
..l don't have anything
to do after 9 o'clock.
So l thought l'd do this.
Where did this sofa come from?
- This one?
Yes.
- lt's your sofa.
No.
- Yes.
lt was hidden behind
your pile of clothes.
And yes.. l found your house key.
Or should l say.. keys.
Coffee. Low fat.
What. l like full fat.
- You're most welcome.
Day 3, your turn to make a wish
Why am l.. so scared of your wish?
Okay.
Let's just forget
about these wishes.
lt's a bad idea anyway.
- Why?
Now that it's my turn,
suddenly it's a bad idea?
lt's not like my wish
has been fulfilled either.
l will get your wish fulfilled.
lt will take time though..
And anyway we've got 19days.
Yeah right.
Tell me.. or l'll just
die out of suspense.
So my wish is that we'll swim..
..in the middle of the
Atlantic Ocean, today.
What?
- Yes.
That's dumb.
lts minus two degrees and l
don't indulge in such madness.
Oh, so your wish is ''Beautiful,
special, you won't understand''..
..and my wish is dumb?
Kiara, that is suicide.
- Really?
Fine.
ls this why you've kept me alive?
Bathing in the sea has
made you even more salty
Wouldn't it be so easy..
to forget everything and
live each day happily..
To fulfil your every wish,
like its your last day
But life always interferes.
Here. Write.
- What?
What you just said?
Live each day like it's your last.
Why?
- Just write it.
Leave.
l wish that someone..
..without a reason
to live, finds this.
l wish that
there's no one like that.
Okay, its bikini time.
Akash, where is my
bag with the swimsuit.
lt must be there.
- l don't really see it.
l am sorry.. l forgot
that bag on the jetty.
What?
- Yes.
No, Akash.
- l am so sorry.
Come on, let's go back.
Just a minute, we
aren't going anywhere.
How will we swim
without our swim suits?
Actually, l can.
- How?
Oh, come on.
l have this.
l am not going to
take off my clothes.
l am not shameless like you.
l am shameless?
- Of course.
There's no one around here for
atleast 10 kilometres, to see you.
Look, l have no
interest in seeing you undress
Hey, watch it.
- What else can l say?
l am very interested
in seeing you undress.
But l control myself. Happy?
That's why l think we should go back
Don't put up a charade.
Crazy woman.
Wants to swim here in the cold.
Akash.. My leg..
- Kiara!
Akash.
- Kiara!
Kiara, catch!
Catch!
Oh God.
Help! Help! l can't swim.
Akash.
l can't swim.
The boat.
The boat's drifting away, Akash.
ls this why you forgot the bag?
because you can't swim.
lf you weren't acting
that you're drowning..
..we wouldn't be here and the
boat wouldn't have drifted away
So, now it's my fault?
- Of course it's your fault.
ls it my fault that you can't swim?
l wonder which era
you've landed here from.
Now, l am stuck with you.
l want to pee.
- What?
Here? Right now?
- Yes.
You.. you can't do it here.
- What do you mean?
How long can l control it?
- l don't know.
But doing it in the water,
that's disgusting Akash.
Why.. why don't you
swim a little ahead?
The waves will take it away
A wave like that one.
Akash, what's that?
ls that a shark?
No, no, that's not a shark.
lt looks like a floating cloth.
lt looks like someone's boxers.
You pervert.
And l was standing
next to you all this while
Disgusting.
My boxers.
Go get them
l told you l don't know how to swim.
Could you please get them for me?
l am not going to touch your boxers.
Please, they'll float away.
And l certainly don't want
to die without them. Please.
Thanks.
l am Sorry for all this.
- lts okay.
Anyway, you look
rather strange saying sorry.
You're better grumpy.
You think we should hug..
lt's very cold.
lts so strange, isn't it?
We tried so hard
to die but couldn't.
And today when we
tried to live a little..
Anyway, you didn't
complete your story.
There's no one here
to disturb us now.
Hey, its me Rachael.
Can't wait to see you.
lt's been five months
since that night in LA.
Finally you agreed to see me again.
l forgot to give you my room
number.l am in Hotel Hilton..
And the room number is.. same
as the one we were in LA.
l'll be waiting..
Hi.
- Hi.
A friend of mine from LA,
her name is Rachael.
Could l have her room number please?
l am sorry l can't give
out that information..
..but l can go ahead and
give her a call for you.
Ya, please.
There she is.
Thank you.
Hi.
What floor?
Same floor.
Have a good night
- You too.
l am ready now, your room is done.
Thanks.
Hello.
- Hey, Kiara.
Hi Babes
Kunal where are you?
- Are you alright.
l am at the restaurant, why?
No, it's nothing.
l'll call you later, okay.
- Okay.
Can l get a beer?
- Cheers.
Hey, can l buy you a drink?
Yeah.
Why god..
Why is my love so cursed
Why god..
'And you know what.. we
will run away on this'
Why god.. Why is my love so cursed?
And my heart
shattered by his betrayal
What happened to your hair?
New look
But l loved your hair, Kiara.
- l know.
You'll get used to this as well.
- What's wrong?
ls there something that you
want to tell me? - No, nothing.
ls there something l
should know, Kunal?
Kiara, what's wrong with you today?
Anyway, l have to go
to the restaurant..
..for an important meeting.
Snap out of it.
A meeting like last night's?
Like the one at the Hilton Hotel?
Like the one in room no. 504?
Who is she?
Rachael, from LA.
l met her five months ago.
And you had the nerve to
give me this when you got back..
No, Kiara. No.
Please. That was the
first and the last time.
l just went there yesterday,
to tell her that it's over.
lt's over.
Kiara, please forgive me.
We don't need this.
We're getting married in two weeks.
l'll keep you very happy.
l don't know why l strayed?
Please forgive me. Please.
l promise. l won't
do it again. Please.
Okay. l forgive you.
- Really?
l forgive you, Kunal.
But you will have to
forgive me as well.
Because last night l did
exactly what you did, Kunal.
l slept with someone.
Please, Kunal.
Please forgive me.
This will never happen again.
l promise.
We're getting married
in two weeks, Kunal.
We don't need this.
l will keep you very happy, Kunal.
l don't know why l strayed?
This won't happen again,
Kunal. l promise.
Forgive me, Kunal.
l tried a lot..
to live without him.
But l failed.
Every single time.. l just failed.

Alright! Day six. Your turn to wish
Tell me what you want to do?
Bungee jumping.
Sky-diving.. l know what,
let's swim again.
l've learnt how to swim now.
Come on, say anything.
Are you alright? - Lets do something
spontaneous, adventurous, fun.
These three words.. and you?
Are you on drugs?
- Shut up.
Come on, say something.
l want to go somewhere far?
- Where?
Wait.
Come on.
- What?
Stand up.
That's a map and these are darts.
We will go wherever the dart lands.
You know like a holiday.
Let it be, l was
just kidding, Akash.
Like that stupid swimming wish.
l don't have any wishes.
- Wait, wait.
This could be my wish.
You know, l've never
been on a holiday.
So l don't even know what a
holiday is.. what happens on one.
Never?
- Yes.
Really?
- Really.
But that's not really important.
l could just carry on
without knowing what it feels like.
How does it matter?
Hang on.
You know what we should do this.
ln fact, we will do this.
Give those to me.
Really.
- Yes, lets go.
Come on.
Where has it landed?
Hell.
- ls Hell even a place?
lt's in Michigan.
Do you want to go there?
Are you mad?
Did l hit it right this time?
l don't know. lt's on some desert.
Move.
You didn't see it right..
lt's Vegas.
But what will we do in Vegas?
Dude, you've no idea
how much fun we'll have.
Alright, let's go to Vegas.

There's not a single tree around.

That's it, you've got two options.
Either you get down here, or
then wait for half an hour.
l won't go searching the entire
desert for a tree for you to pee.
Fine.
Akash.
- What?
What if there are snakes here?
There can't be any
snakes here, Kiara.
How do you know that?
- Well, because it's too bloody hot.
And they aren't
fools like us, you know.
Listen, please come with me.
lf l have to come with you,
then why notjust pee right here..

go all the way there?
Just come please.
Let's go.

Okay, okay, stop, stop.

Okay.
Oh shit.
Stop! Stop!
Stop! Stop!
Hey, stop.
Oh my God. They took Blush.

Why did you stop chasing them?
Why didn't you stop them?

l didn't do anything.

Not even once.
And we say that life's not fair.
ln these past few days
l have learnt that..
..no matter how many
reasons you have to die..
..you need just one to live.
l found your reason, Kiara.
You have a beautiful family,
you have Kunal.
Everything can go
back to what it was.
lf you just give him a chance.
You still love him, Kiara.
You're doing all this
because l don't love you, Akash.
You're very bad at
handling rejection.
lt's not about me, Kiara. - Oh
yeah Mr. Hotshot Wall Street guy.
You're actually thinking
about someone else, wow.
Yes, Kiara, maybe l can
think about someone else.
l'm not saying that Kunal
didn't do anything wrong.
But that's what a mistake means.
lt is possible for
you love someone,,
..but make the mistake by
straying away with someone else.
lt could've happened
with you too last night.
lt's possible, Kiara.
Go back to him.
You know your
happiness lies with him.
Everything can be just as it was.
Where you felt that you're
the luckiest girl in the world.
There's just a slight change.
Now Kunal is the
luckiest boy in this world.
What is your address?
l am sorry, Akash.
For all that l said
in a fit of rage..
..l didn't mean them.
Take Blush with you.
Her?
But, she only listens to you.
She will now start
listening to you too.
How will l know that you're fine?
Where will l call you?
You won't have to.
l will call you.
Aakash.

You?
Remember.. l have no interest in you
Zilch

you aren't interested in me?
Not that l want you to
be interested in me.
You know what l mean?
Then what are you doing here?
You're all dressed up
Yeah and l've done my hair too.
You do know that we're
going to jump into the water?
And your hair will
get really messed up.
Probably.
Because jumping from here..
..is like jumping from the
Splat! as soon as you land.
Do you have a better option?
- Yeah, there is another one..
But it's slightly romantic.
lnstead ofjumping from here..
..we could just go down
and walk into the water.
Oh my, God. lts really cold.
Just a little bit longer.
And we won't even feel it anymore
So.. it was really nice knowing you.
Yes, you too.
lt's cold.
- Really.

Really?

Where?
There.
- No, that can't be our bottle.
Wait, l'll go get it.

Our bottle.

Are you okay? you okay?
Look, this isn't out bottle..
..but there's a note
inside this one too
Alright.
We tried to die
together many times..
..and it was so much fun.
Just imagine.. how great it would
be if we decided to live together.
l don't want to think,
l just want to live..
..with you. Kiara.
Forever and ever.
Till the day l die.
Akash
Oh my, God.
Akash
What is this?
Oh my, God.
lt's a ring. Where

Finally.
Where did you get it from?
Kiara, l am proposing to you.
Oh, sorry.
- Continue.
Kiara, will you.
Oh my, God. lt's you again.
Oh no. You dropped the ring.
Come on.
Come on.
Could you dim the light please?
You're killing the mood.
Akash
- So, will you..
Kiara. Kiara. Kiara.
Yes, l will. l will.
ls it a yes?
- Yes.
You found the ring?
- Yes.
And l said yes as well.
Then why don't you wear it.
Stupid, you are
supposed to make me wear it
But if you want l
can wear it myself.
No wait, give me the ring.
Your fingers are quite fat.
No, they are not.
They just tend to
swell up when it's cold.
Shall we put the ring on
the little finger then?
Yes.
There.
Your wish has been fulfilled.
Well that's going to happen a little
later, if you know what l mean
l love you Kiara.
l love you.
''Close your eyes when you
don't see your destination.''
Are you guys trying to
