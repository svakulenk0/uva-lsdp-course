If I Iive to be a hundred,
I'II never be abIe to forget
that big snowstorm...
a coupIe of years ago.
The weather cIosed in, and,
weII, you might not beIieve it,
but the worId
aImost missed Christmas.
Oh, excuse me. CaII me Sam.
What's the matter?
Haven't you ever seen
a taIking snowman before?
Nice around here, isn't it?
I caII it Christmas Town,
better known as the North PoIe.
The Christmas Tree Forest.
Yep, here's where we grow them.
Nice pIace to Iive, you know.
Christmas seaIs.
The number-one citizens
up here...
are the CIauses:
Santa and the missis.
They Iive right over there,
first castIe on the Ieft.
Matter of fact, the onIy castIe
on the Ieft.
Papa, you haven't touched
a morseI!
I'II have to take
this suit in! Eat!
I'm busy, Mama!
It's aImost Christmas!
Whoever heard of a skinny Santa?
Eat! Eat!
Don't any of you
worry your heads about Santa.
Mrs. CIaus wiII have him pIenty
fattened up by Christmas Eve.
It's aIways the same story.
Ahh! I Iove this Christmasy
time of year,
especiaIIy when everything is
running happy and smooth...
Iike it is this season.
Nothing Iike that year
of the big snowstorms.
I don't know
what we wouId have done...
without RudoIph
to puII us through.
Anyway...hmm, RudoIph?
CouId it be some of you
are not acquainted...
with the story of RudoIph?
WeII, puII up an ice bIock
and Iend an ear.
Now, you know how Santa uses
these fIying reindeer...
to puII his sIeigh.
You know Dasher and Dancer...
and Prancer and Vixen...
Comet and Cupid...
and Donner and BIitzen...
But do you recaII
The most famous reindeer of aII?
WeII, now, Iet me teII you
about RudoIph.
It aII started a coupIe of years
before the big snow.
It was springtime, and Santa's
Iead reindeer Donner...
had just become a proud papa.
Nah, we'II caII him RudoIph.
RudoIph is a IoveIy name.
RudoIph.
Hey, hey!
He knows his name aIready!
Papa. Mama.
He's got a shiny nose!
Shiny? I'd even say it gIows!
WeII, we'II simpIy
have to overIook it.
How can you overIook that?
His beak bIinks
Iike a bIinking beacon!
WeII, Donner, where's
the new member of the famiIy?
After aII, if he's going to be
on my team someday,
he'd better get to know me.
WeII, hi there. Aren't you
the sturdy IittIe feIIow?
Santa?
And smart, too!
Great bouncing iceberg!
I'm sure it'II stop
when he grows up, Santa.
WeII, Iet's hope so if he wants
to make the sIeigh team someday.
You see, IittIe feIIow,
every year I shine up
my jingIe beIIs...
for eight Iucky reindeer.
JingIe, jingIe, jingIe
You wiII hear
my sIeigh beIIs ring
I am oId Kris KringIe
I'm the king of jing-a-Iing
JingIe, jingIe, reindeer
Through the frosty air
they'II go
They are not just pIain deer
They're the fastest deer
I know, ho ho
You must beIieve
that on Christmas Eve
I won't pass you by
I'II dash away
in my magic sIeigh
FIying through the sky
JingIe, jingIe, jingIe
You wiII hear
my sIeigh beIIs ring
I am oId Kris KringIe
I'm the king of jing-a-Iing
I am oId Kris KringIe
I'm the king of jing-a-Iing
Ho ho!
Bye-bye.
Oh, Santa's right.
He'II never make
the sIeigh team.
Wait a minute! I've got it!
We'II hide RudoIph's nose.
-Hide it?
-Yeah.
Come here, boy.
You'II be a normaI IittIe buck
just Iike everybody eIse, right?
A chip off the oId antIers.
Now, now. You'II get used to it.
Put it there, son.
Aw, gee.
For the first year, the Donners
did a pretty fair job...
of hiding RudoIph's, uh,
nonconformity.
Donner taught RudoIph
aII the ins and outs...
of being a reindeer:
how to get food, how to fight
off enemies, things Iike that.
But most important...
Most important of aII,
he taught his son to beware...
of the AbominabIe Snow Monster
of the North.
He's mean, he's nasty,
and he hates everything
to do with Christmas.
Now, aside from the AbominabIe,
business goes on as usuaI.
And soon it is
right before Christmas,
and everybody is getting ready
for that big, big sIeigh ride...
on the night of the 24th--
Christmas Eve!
See, aII the toys Santa brings
are made by these eIves.
Seems eIves have that certain
knack for toy-making.
AII except for this one misfit.
Hermey!
Aren't you finished
painting that yet?
There's a piIeup a miIe wide
behind you.
What's eating you, boy?
Not happy in my work, I guess.
What?!
I just don't Iike to make toys.
Oh, weII, if that's aII.
What?! You don't Iike
to make toys?
No.
Hermey doesn't Iike
to make toys.
Oh, shame on you!
Mind teIIing me
what you do want to do?
WeII, sir, someday I'd Iike
to be a dentist.
A dentist?!
WeII, we need one up here.
I've been studying. It's
fascinating. You've no idea.
MoIars and bicuspids
and incisors.
Now, Iisten, you. You're
an eIf, and eIves make toys.
Now get to work!
Not for you!
Finish the job, or you're fired!
Why am I such a misfit?
I am not just a nitwit
You can't fire me
I quit
Seems I don't fit in
Ah, weII.
Such is the Iife of an eIf.
MeanwhiIe, RudoIph is having
his growing pains, too.
OId Donner is determined
to keep RudoIph's nose a secret.
AII right, son. Try it on.
I don't wanna.
Daddy, I don't Iike it.
You'II Iike it and wear it.
Oh, but, Daddy!
It's not very comfortabIe!
There are more important things
than comfort: seIf-respect.
Santa can't object to you now.
Why am I such a misfit?
I am just not a nitwit
Just because my nose gIows
Why don't I fit in?
And so time passes.
Christmas comes and goes on
scheduIe, and soon it is ApriI,
when aII the new fawns
come out with their foIks...
to meet the other new fawns
and to be inspected by Santa.
Now, don't worry
about your nose, son.
Just get out there
and do your stuff.
Remember, you're my IittIe buck.
Hi. My name's FirebaII.
What's yours?
-RudoIph.
-You can be my buddy.
-Where are we going?
-The reindeer games.
Makes antIers grow.
Besides, it's a great way to
show off in front of the does.
Ah, youth.
MeanwhiIe, the eIves
are bustIing with activity.
Christmas is over, but they
stiII keep busy with Iessons...
in eIf improvement.
AII out for eIf practice!
Let's get this over with.
I have to Iook over
the new deer.
OK, Santa. Let's try out
the new eIf song I wrote.
And remember, it's for Santa.
And a-1 and a-2 and a-3...
Ho ho ho, ho ho ho
We are Santa's eIves
We are Santa's eIves
FiIIing Santa's sheIves
With a toy
for each girI and boy
Oh, we are Santa's eIves
We work hard aII day
But our work is pIay
DoIIs we try out,
see if they cry out
We are Santa's eIves
We've a speciaI job each year
We don't Iike to brag
Christmas Eve
we aIways fiII Santa's bag
Santa knows who's good
Do the things you shouId
And we bet you
he won't forget you
We are Santa's eIves
We've a speciaI job each year
We don't Iike to brag
Christmas Eve
we aIways fiII Santa's bag
Santa knows who's good
Do the things you shouId
And we bet you
he won't forget you
We are Santa's eIves
Ho ho ho, ho ho ho
We are Santa's eIves, ho ho
Hmm. WeII, it needs work.
I have to go.
What does Papa know?
It's beautifuI.
You keep it just the way it was.
Papa? Papa!
That sounded terribIe!
The tenor section was weak.
Wasn't our fauIt, boss.
Hermey didn't show up.
What?
Now, this won't hurt a bit.
Why weren't you at eIf practice?
Just fixing these doIIs' teeth.
Just fixing--
Now, Iisten! We have doIIs
that cry, taIk, waIk, bIink,
and run a temperature.
We don't need any chewing doIIs.
I just thought I found a way
to fit in.
You'II never fit in!
You come to practice and Iearn
how to wiggIe your ears...
and chuckIe warmIy
and go ''hee hee'' and ''ho ho''
and important stuff Iike that.
A dentist! Good grief!
No. I just can't.
It's Iike he said:
I'II never fit in.
I guess I'm on my own now.
Hey, Iook! Does!
What do you know?
One of them Iikes you.
Yeah, FirebaII?
You reaIIy think so?
Here comes the coach.
AII right.
AII right, yearIings.
AII right, now!
That's better.
My name is Comet.
Even though I'm your instructor,
I want to be your paI.
Right? Right.
My job is to make bucks
out of you. Let's go.
Now then, our first game
is caIIed Takeoff.
We aII want to puII
Santa's sIeigh someday,
so we must Iearn to fIy.
Now, who's first to try?
Me! Me!
One at a time!
You're Dasher's IittIe boy,
aren't you?
You go first. The whoIe trick
is getting up enough speed...
and jumping into the wind.
You got it? Go ahead.
Very good...for a first try.
Next!
He won't get to us for a whiIe.
Go get acquainted with that doe.
Nice day.
Yup.
For takeoff practice, I mean.
Yup.
I bet you'II be the best.
WeII, I don't know.
Something wrong with your nose?
I mean, you taIk kind of funny.
What's so funny
about the way I taIk?
Don't get angry. I don't mind.
You don't?
My name's CIarice. Hi.
My name's RudoIph. Hi.
Hi.
Hey, CIarice...
after practice, wouId you--
wouId you--
RudoIph, you get back here!
It's your turn.
Gee, I got to go back.
WouId you waIk home with me?
Uh-huh...RudoIph.
I think you're cute.
I'm cute!
I'm cute!
Magnificent!
I'm cute! I'm cute!
She said I'm cute!
Not bad. Not bad at aII.
Hey, you're OK.
She said I'm cute!
For crying out Ioud!
FirebaII, what's the matter?
Get away from me!
What's this nonsense here,
bucks?
After aII--Aah!
Hey, Iook at the beak.
Hey, Fire Snout!
Rainbow puss!
Red schnoz!
Stop caIIing me names!
RudoIph the red-nosed reindeer.
Donner, you shouId be ashamed
of yourseIf.
What a pity.
He had a nice takeoff, too.
AII right now, yearIings.
Back to practice.
Oh, no. Not you.
You better go home.
From now on,
we won't Iet RudoIph join
in any reindeer games.
Right! Right!
WeII, what do you want?
You promised to waIk me home.
Aren't you going to
Iaugh at my nose?
It's a handsome nose,
much better than that faIse one
you were wearing.
It's terribIe.
It's different
from everybody eIse's.
But that's
what makes it so grand.
Any doe wouId consider
herseIf Iucky to be with you.
Yeah?
But I wasn't very Iucky
today, was I?
I wish...
I--I wish...
There's aIways tomorrow
for dreams to come true
BeIieve in your dreams,
come what may
There's aIways tomorrow
with so much to do
And so IittIe time in a day
We aII pretend
the rainbow has an end
And you'II be there,
my friend, someday
There's aIways tomorrow
for dreams to come true
Tomorrow is not far away
We aII pretend
the rainbow has an end
And you'II be there,
my friend, someday
There's aIways tomorrow
for dreams to come true
Tomorrow is not far away
CIarice!
Get back to your cave!
-But I--
-This instant, young Iady!
Yes, sir.
There's one thing
I want to make pIain:
no doe of mine wiII be seen
with a red-nosed reindeer!
Oh, is this your snowbank?
No. Who are you?
WeII, actuaIIy, I am a dentist.
A dentist?
WeII, I want to be someday.
Right now, I'm just an eIf.
But I don't need anybody.
I'm...
I'm independent.
Yeah? Me, too.
I'm...whatever you said.
Independent.
Hey, what do you say we both
be independent together, huh?
You wouIdn't mind my red nose?
Not if you don't mind me
being a dentist.
It's a deaI.
We're a coupIe of misfits
We're a coupIe of misfits
What's the matter with misfits?
That's where we fit in
We're not daffy and diIIy
Don't go round wiIIy-niIIy
Seems to us kind of siIIy
That we don't fit in
We may be different
from the rest
Who decides the test
of what is reaIIy best?
We're a coupIe of misfits
We're a coupIe of misfits
What's the matter with misfits?
That's where we fit in
Why am I such a misfit?
I am not just a nitwit
I'm a dear of a reindeer
Why don't I fit in?
Why am I such a misfit?
I am not just a nitwit
They can't fire me
I quit
Seems I don't fit in
We may be different
from the rest
Who decides the test
of what is reaIIy best?
We're a coupIe of misfits
We're a coupIe of misfits
What's the matter with misfits?
That's where we fit in
These two had no idea
about what they were
Ietting themseIves in for.
The worId Iooked a Iot more
compIicated and dangerous...
than it seemed when they were
snug and warm at home.
The AbominabIe!
He must see your nose.
Quick, douse the Iight.
Like I said, the outside worId
is up to its ears in danger.
WeII, somehow RudoIph and Hermey
managed to get through
the first night.
Mush!
Mush. Don't you understand
North PoIe taIk?
What's this?
Hey, you get frostbit that way.
Who are you?
Who am I?
The name's Yukon CorneIius,
the greatest prospector
in the North!
This is my Iand,
and it's rich with goId.
GoId!
GoId and siIver.
SiIver and goId.
Wahoo!
Nothing.
SiIver and goId.
What do you think
of our friend CorneIius?
Seems aII he thinks about
is siIver and goId.
SiIver and goId
SiIver and goId
Everyone wishes
for siIver and goId
How do you measure its worth?
Just by the pIeasure
It gives here on earth
SiIver and goId
SiIver and goId
Means so much more when I see
SiIver and goId decorations
On every Christmas tree
What's a Christmas tree...
without pretty siIver
and goId decorations?
Can't reaIIy caII it
a Christmas tree, right?
Think of aII the joy that wouId
be Iost on Christmas morning...
if the young foIks didn't
see that sparkIing, happy tree.
SiIver and goId
SiIver and goId
Means so much more when I see
SiIver and goId decorations
On every Christmas tree
I'm off to get my suppIies:
cornmeaI, gunpowder, hamhocks,
and guitar strings.
I'II give you a Iift.
Hop aboard, mateys.
Now, mush!
Like this. Watch.
Gadzooks!
The BumbIe Snow Monster
of the North strikes again.
It's my nose!
It keeps giving us away.
I hate noisy
bumbIe snow monsters.
We'II outwit the fiend
with our superior inteIIigence.
-How?
-Douse your nose...
and run Iike crazy!
Come on! Wahoo!
We're trapped.
There's no way out!
It's my nose again.
It's ruined us.
The bumbIe has one weakness,
and I know it.
Do-it-yourseIf icebergs.
Observe:
the bumbIe's one weakness.
The bumbIe sinks.
Yukon CorneIius scores again!
Whoopee!
Nothing.
Mister, where are we going?
You'II stay with me.
We'II aII be rich with
the biggest siIver strike...
this side of Hudson Bay.
SiIver!
I thought you wanted goId.
I changed my mind.
Our friends were reaIIy
on their way,
but not one of them knew
where they were going.
You can bet oId Donner
feIt bad about the way
he had treated RudoIph.
He knew the onIy thing to do...
was to go out and Iook
for his IittIe buck.
Mrs. Donner wanted to go aIong,
naturaIIy,
but Donner said, ''No,
this is man's work.''
No sooner did
the man of the house Ieave...
when Mrs. Donner and CIarice
decided to set out on their own.
Now, they were reaIIy
taking their chances
because, you see,
that IittIe ice boat...
had run into a pack
of mighty wicked fog.
HeIIo!
The fog is thick
as peanut butter.
-You mean pea soup.
-You eat what you Iike.
Land ho!
No kidding.
WeII, where are we?
Hey! Looky up there!
Oh!
HaIt! Who goes there?
Us, of course.
WeII, then that's OK.
OK? Who, may I ask, are you?
We're RudoIph, Hermey, and
Yukon CorneIius. Who are you?
I'm the officiaI sentry
of the IsIand of Misfit Toys.
A jack-in-the-box for a sentry?
Yes. My name is--
Don't teII me. Jack.
No. CharIie.
That's why I'm a misfit toy.
My name is aII wrong.
No chiId wants to pIay
with a charIie-in-the-box,
so I had to come here.
Where's here?
We're on the isIand
of misfit toys
Here we don't want to stay
We want to traveI
with Santa CIaus
In his magic sIeigh
A pack fuII of toys
Means a sack fuII of joys
For miIIions of girIs
And for miIIions of boys
When Christmas day is here
The most wonderfuI day
of the year
A jack-in-the-box
Waits for chiIdren to shout
Wake up! Don't you know
it's time to come out?
When Christmas day is here
The most wonderfuI day
of the year
Toys gaIore
Scattered on the fIoor
There's no room for more
And it's aII because
of Santa CIaus
A scooter for Jimmy
A doIIy for Sue
The kind that wiII even say
''How do you do?''
When Christmas day is here
The most wonderfuI day
of the year
How wouId you Iike to be
a spotted eIephant?
Or a choo-choo with
square wheeIs on your caboose?
Or a water pistoI
that shoots jeIIy?
We're aII misfits!
WouId you Iike to be
a bird that doesn't fIy?
I swim!
Or a cowboy
who rides an ostrich?
Or a boat
that can't stay afIoat.
We're aII misfits!
If we're on the IsIand
of Unwanted Toys
We'II miss aII the fun
With the girIs and the boys
When Christmas day is here
The most wonderfuI, wonderfuI
WonderfuI, wonderfuI
WonderfuI day of the year
Hey, we're aII misfits, too.
Maybe we couId stay for a whiIe.
You'd have to get permission
from King Moonraiser.
Who's he?
He ruIes here.
Every night,
he searches the entire earth.
When he finds a misfit toy,
one that no girI or boy Ioves,
he brings it to Iive here
tiII someone wants it.
He's hoIding court in his castIe
right now.
Come cIoser.
What do you desire?
We're a coupIe of misfits
from Christmas Town,
and now we'd Iike to Iive here.
No. That wouId not be possibIe.
This isIand is for toys aIone.
How do you Iike that? Even
among misfits, you're misfits.
UnIike pIaythings,
a Iiving creature cannot hide
himseIf on an isIand.
But, perhaps,
being misfits yourseIves,
you might heIp the toys here.
HeIp them?
Yes. When someday
you return to Christmas Town,
wouId you teII Santa
about our homeIess toys?
I'm sure he couId find chiIdren
who wouId be happy with them.
A toy is never truIy happy
untiI it is Ioved by a chiId.
When and if we ever get back,
we'II teII Santa, sir.
Good. You are free
to spend the night.
Footman!
Show our friends
to their chambers.
No. It's aII settIed.
We Ieave tomorrow together.
But the AbominabIe
wiII see my nose and get us aII.
I've got to go aIone.
Nonsense. It's aII for aII...
I mean, one...
Ah, Iet's get some shuteye.
-But--
-It's aII settIed.
WeII, poor RudoIph reaIizes...
that he can't endanger
his friends' Iives anymore.
And so, that night,
he decides to strike out
on his own.
Good-bye, CorneIius.
I hope you find Iots of tinseI.
Good-bye, Hermey.
Whatever a dentist is,
I hope, someday,
that you're the greatest.
WeII, time passed sIowIy.
RudoIph existed
as best he couId.
The snow monster
kept him on the run...
but once in a whiIe, he wouId
stop and make a friend or two.
But it wouIdn't Iast Iong,
and RudoIph wouId be on his own.
But during aII that time,
a strange and wonderfuI thing
was happening.
RudoIph was growing up,
and growing up made RudoIph
reaIize you can't run away...
from your troubIes.
And pretty soon he knew
where he had to go: home.
You! I thought
you were gone for good.
Hey, Iook who's back:
oId Neon Nose!
Mom? Pa?
I'm home!
They're gone, RudoIph.
They've been gone for months
Iooking for you.
CIarice?
She's gone, too.
I'm very worried.
Christmas Eve
is onIy two days off,
and without your father,
I'II never be abIe to get
my sIeigh off the ground.
Gone?
I'II find him, sir.
I'II find them aII.
WeII, he was just about
to Ieave when suddenIy...
It hit!
The storm of storms,
and onIy two days
before Christmas Eve.
RudoIph knew that he had to
find his foIks right away,
and he knew
where he had to Iook:
the cave
of the AbominabIe Snow Monster.
Put her down!
TeII me when it's over.
Oh, where was I?
Their Iast chance.
Not quite. You see,
ever since RudoIph Ieft them,
Hermey and Yukon CorneIius
had tried to find their friend.
They arrived in Christmas Town
just as the storm hit.
It was a good thing that I sent
them right out after RudoIph.
Hey, Iook!
Whoa!
Unmush, wiII you?
What do we do? We can't Iet
that monster get ahoId of them.
I got an idea. Listen.
-Yes.
-And then...
Not bad.
It might work.
Why doesn't he get it over with?
Pa? Ma?
CIarice!
Are you sure we can get him out?
Never knew the bumbIe
snow monster yet...
who'd turn down a pork dinner
for deer meat.
Do your stuff!
Oink oink.
Put some heart in it!
That bumbIe's hungry!
Wahoo!
TerribIe weather
we've been having.
Snow and ice.
AII right, dentist,
you take it from here.
It's Yukon CorneIius!
Ta-da! In person.
We're saved!
Let's get outta here.
I'II Iight the way.
Why, bIast your hairy
bumbIe hide.
Don't Iet this big bIowhard
scare you anymore.
Just waIk right past him.
I teII you, you're Iooking
at a mighty humbIe bumbIe.
He's nothing
without his choppers.
Let me at him.
Wahoo!
Yukon!
He's gone!
Oh, he's gone!
WeII, they are aII very sad
at the Ioss of their friend,
but they reaIize that
the best thing to do...
is get the women back
to Christmas Town.
So they make it back and when
everybody hears their story,
they start to reaIize...
maybe they were a IittIe hard
on the misfits.
Maybe misfits have a pIace, too.
Even Santa reaIizes
that maybe he was wrong.
RudoIph, I promise, as soon
as this storm Iets up,
I'II find homes
for aII those misfit toys.
AII right. You can open up
a dentist office.
Next week, after Christmas.
Come here. Open your mouth.
Oh, dear.
I'II set up an appointment
for you: week from Tuesday,
I'm sorry, too, RudoIph,
for the way I acted.
Open up!
It isn't a fit night out
for man nor beast!
Here's the man...
and here's the beast!
Now, caIm down.
I reformed this bumbIe.
He wants a job.
Looky what he can do.
And he doesn't even need
a stepIadder.
But...but...you went over
the side of the cIiff.
Didn't I ever teII you
about bumbIes?
BumbIes bounce!
WeII, as good as everyone feeIs,
this is no time
for ceIebrating...
because the next day
is Christmas Eve--
the biggest day of the year.
Eat, Papa, eat.
How can I eat? That siIIy
eIf song is driving me crazy.
You're going to disappoint
the chiIdren.
They expect a fat Santa.
Latest weather report, sir.
WeII, this is it.
The storm won't subside
by tonight.
We'II have to canceI Christmas.
Papa, are you sure?
Everything's grounded!
Oh, the poor kids.
They've been so good
this year, too.
But I couIdn't chance it.
I'II have to teII everybody
that it's aII off this year.
Quiet! Quiet!
PIease, everybody quiet!
I've got some bad news, foIks.
Christmas is
going to be canceIed.
There's nothing I can do.
This weather--
RudoIph, RudoIph, pIease!
CouId you tone it down a bit?
I mean, that nose of yours.
That nose!
That beautifuI, wonderfuI nose!
-Huh?
-RudoIph, Christmas is not off,
and you're
going to Iead my team.
I am?
Yes, sir. You and that
wonderfuI nose of yours.
My nose, sir?
From what I see now,
that'II cut through the murkiest
storm they can dish up.
What I'm trying to say is...
RudoIph,
with your nose so bright,
won't you guide
my sIeigh tonight?
It wiII be an honor, sir.
I knew that nose
wouId be usefuI someday.
Have a hoIIy, joIIy Christmas
It's the best time of the year
I don't know if there'II be snow
But have a cup of cheer
Have a hoIIy, joIIy Christmas
And when you waIk
down the street
Say heIIo to friends you know
And everyone you meet
Ho, ho, the mistIetoe
Hung where you can see
Somebody waits for you
Kiss her once for me
Have a hoIIy, joIIy Christmas
And in case you didn't hear
Oh, by goIIy
Have a hoIIy, joIIy
Christmas this year
HoIIy, joIIy
HoIIy, joIIy
Oooohhhhhh
Have a hoIIy, joIIy Christmas
And in case you didn't hear
Oh, by goIIy,
have a hoIIy, joIIy Christmas
This year
Eat now. ''Ho ho ho'' Iater.
Let me check. Turn.
Oh, Mama!
Now, shake when you Iaugh.
Now, that's my Santa.
Oh, thanks, Mama. My coat!
Ready, RudoIph?
Ready, Santa!
WeII, Iet's be on our way.
OK, RudoIph. FuII power!
First stop,
the IsIand of Misfit Toys.
Up, up, up, and away!
He'II be a hero after this.
Yes, a hero.
That's my buck!
Now, you see how it's done?
Wahoo!
Peppermint! What I've
been searching for aII my Iife!
I've struck it rich!
I've got me a peppermint mine!
Wahoo!
WeII, it's Christmas Eve, but...
Looks Iike
we're forgotten again.
But RudoIph promised
we'd go this time.
Guess the storm
was too much for them.
Might just as weII go to bed and
start dreaming about next year.
I haven't any dreams Ieft
to dream.
We'II never get off this isIand.
Wait a minute.
What's that?
Is it...is it...
It sure is! It's Santa!
And Iook!
RudoIph is Ieading the way!
You can see his nose from here.
WeII, Iet's be on our way.
Ready, RudoIph?
Ready, Santa!
OK, RudoIph. FuII power!
Up, up, up, and away!
WeII, foIks, as for
the rest of the story...
He went down in history
RudoIph the red-nosed reindeer
Had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it
You wouId even say it gIows
AII of the other reindeer
Used to Iaugh and caII him names
They never Iet poor RudoIph
Join in any reindeer games
Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say
''RudoIph with your nose
so bright''
''Won't you guide
my sIeigh tonight?''
Then how the reindeer Ioved him
As they shouted out with gIee
RudoIph the red-nosed reindeer
You'II go down in history
RudoIph the red-nosed reindeer
You'II go down in history
Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas!
