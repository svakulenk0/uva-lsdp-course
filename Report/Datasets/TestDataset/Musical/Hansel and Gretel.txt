Hansel. Gretel.
Get up, you lazy bones.
I'll not call you again.
Hansel. Hansel, wake up.
I was having
such a beautiful dream.
What did you dream?
We lived in
a beautiful castle,
you and I.
And we each
had our own little pony
to ride.
What else?
We didn't have to do
any chores. None at all.
We were a prince
and a princess, you see,
and nobody could
tell us what to do.
Nobody?
Nobody.
I like that dream.
Hansel. Gretel.
We're coming, Mother.
We're coming, Mother.
But I'm still hungry.
This is for your lunch.
We don't need lunch later.
We need breakfast now.
Don't be so cheeky,
young lady.
Besides, too much breakfast
is bad for the blood.
That was just fine, Maria.
Wasn't it, children?
Yes.
Yes.
It was fine
for a single mouse.
Not for a man and his family.
Go ready the cart
for our journey today.
Yes, Father.
Yes, Father.
Stephan, they haven't
finished the chores
I gave them.
They can do the chores
tomorrow.
I promised
to take them with me.
Tomorrow, tomorrow.
Everything is always put off.
Will we have enough to eat
on our table tomorrow?
Oh, Stephan,
what's going to become of us?
The four of us
are going to starve.
You might as well
start planing the boards
for our coffins.
Don't worry.
I'm sure that I can
sell all the wood
that we can carry.
Have faith.
God will not forsake us.
Now, be a good girl.
Hansel, don't lose your hat.
Stephan, don't let the baker
cheat you.
Impossible. Duncan, come on.
Bye-bye, Mother.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Oh, ask us another one,
Father.
Yes, another riddle.
All right, uh, let me see.
Yes, I've got one.
What has arms and legs
but hasn't got a head?
Is it a fly?
No.
I know, I know.
It's a turtle.
Silly, a turtle has a head.
So does a fly, Hansel.
Oh, tell us, Father.
What has arms, legs,
but hasn't got a head?
A chair.
You think that was
a hard one, Father?
I'll stump you
with a riddle.
What two things
can you never
have for breakfast?
Lunch and dinner.
Lunch and dinner.
Come on, ducks.
Out of the way.
There you are.
Thank you.
Pure mackerel.
Pure mackerel!
That'll do.
Thanks.
Hmm. Mmm?
Pure mackerel.
Pure mackerel.
Hey, woodcutter.
Thank you, blacksmith.
Hey.
Thank you.
Father, look.
The blacksmith gave me
these strange stones.
What are they?
These are flints.
If you strike them together,
they make sparks
to start a fire.
They're a good gift.
Keep them with you always,
and you'll never be cold.
Pure mackerel.
Pure mackerel.
Children,
I told you to sit quietly
while I finish
my business here.
This is the last bundle, sir.
Taste and touch nothing
or your father will
pay for your curiosity.
And the same goes for you.
Sir, the wood basket's full.
I'm putting these by the oven.
Here's your money,
woodcutter.
Sir, this is not
what we agreed upon.
I don't have to
deal with you at all.
I could easily cut my own wood
for my oven.
But I haven't the time,
so you reap the benefits.
Sir, the last time
I brought you wood,
you paid me too little,
and you promised
to pay me fairly this time.
I think you're mistaken,
woodcutter.
I don't remember
any such thing.
Little girl.
And for you,
some delicious cookie crumbs.
What do you say, Gretel?
Thank you, Master baker, sir.
You're very welcome, child.
Come along, children.
Red and yellow ribbons.
Come see and come buy.
A ribbon in the hair
always lights up the eye.
My, what beautiful hair
this child has.
How pretty her hair would look
with a ribbon or two in it.
This one's nice,
but perhaps
a blue satin ribbon
to tie up her hair?
No, thank you.
Children,
why don't you go along
and watch
the Punch and Judy show?
Fish. Fresh fish.
Get your fish here.
Come on. Fish here.
Hello, children,
wouldn't you like
some fresh mackerel?
No, thank you.
Fresh from the sea.
Boysenberry honey.
The fruit of the bee.
Ah, children, golden honey.
The sweet fruit of the bee.
Mmm-hmm.
Delicious. Go on, try it.
Sorry. No, thank you.
...very special,
that's right.
Nice.
They look lovely.
And another bunch of red roses
for your wife?
No, my dear.
Thanks anyway.
Raise your hands
and clap, clap, clap
Turn you head and slap,
slap, slap
Left and right,
left and then
'Round about
and back again
I would like to
dance with him
He is nice and tall
and slim
What's your name, little boy?
Hansel.
Hansel, dear,
would you agree?
Would you dance
a dance with me?
Raise your hands
and clap, clap, clap
Point your toe
and tap, tap, tap
Naughty boy.
Left and right,

Listen to my poem, everybody.
''A fool who's never
changed his mind and who can
think it strange?
The reason's clear,
for fools, my friends,
have not a mind to change''
Ouch.
Come on, Punch, dear.
Let's sing our song.
Raise your hands
and clap, clap, clap
Point your toe
and tap, tap, tap
Left and right,

Come on, everybody,
let's all sing.

Mama. Oh, Mama.
We sang with Punch and Judy.
Really.
Yes, we learned to dance
from the puppets.
Punch and Judy were so funny.
All they did was fight
and hit each other
with a rolling pin.
The blacksmith gave me
two stones that make fire.
Do you want to hear me sing
the song I learned, Mama?
Raise your hands
and clap, clap, clap
No, not now, Gretel.
Look at the beautiful stones.
Father told me
how to use them.
Take your sister inside.
Go on. Go on.
This doesn't taste
like the soup,
it tastes like
the wash water.
I don't think you know
what the wash water
tastes like.
I tried it once.
I really did.
Stop it. Stop it.
How dare you
laugh at this meal.
Next time, I'll eat
the last potato myself.
Children, go to bed.
Yes, go to bed, children.
And if you're lucky,
you'll never wake up.
Maria, how could
you say such a thing?
How could
you let that fat baker
cheat you again?
Are you
a stupid simpleton?
I'm a simple woodcutter.
You're a father.
Haven't you the courage
to stand up to someone
who's taking the food
from your wife and babies
by not paying you
what is rightfully
owed to you?
He's an important man
in town.
I don't care
if he's the King.
I'll go to the town myself
and speak to the baker.
All right, I've heard enough.
I'll go in tomorrow
and I will collect the rest
of what is owed to me.
Mama.
Mama?
Good morning, missus.
Good morning to you,
neighbour.
I've brought
some things for you.
Our cows has been
producing more milk
than we can drink
or make cheese with.
I've brought you
some eggs, too.
l--I have no money
for this, neighbour.
Oh, no need.
Your good husband
has done me favours
many a time.
Why, just last winter,
when I was sick
and couldn't get out of bed,
he brought
firewood to my family
to keep my home warm.
He's a good neighbour
and a good man.
Yes, my husband
cares for everyone.
But this is very kind
of you and your family.
This is heavy. I'll carry it.
Thank you.
You know, yesterday,
when I was delivering
milk to the miller,
he told me that another child
has disappeared
into that cursed North Woods.
They looked hard all day
for that little boy.
Found nothing.
That's terrible.
lf you ask me, my thought is
no one will ever see
that child again, missus.
Look, children.
Fresh milk and some eggs.
Thank you.
Say thank you, children.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Good day.
Mmm, this cream is delicious.
Mmm.
I'm going to make us
some custard.
I can't wait.
Mmm.
This custard would be perfect
with some berries.
I'm going to find some
if I have to search
the forest high and low.
And we're going to have
a real celebration
when your father
gets home tonight.
Oh, I'm so happy.
Now, Gretel, while I'm gone,
you do your darning.
Yes, Mama.
And Hansel,
make sure that weave
is good and tight
or else the broom won't last.
And Hansel,
please do not forget
to give some
water to the donkey.
I won't forget.
May I have this dance, miss?
Yes, kind sir.
Gretel, dear,
I don't know how
When to turn
and how to bow
Show me what I ought to do
So that I may
dance with you
Raise your hands
and clap, clap, clap
Point your toe
and tap, tap, tap
Left and right,
left and then
'Round about
and back again
Raise your hands
and clap, clap, clap
Point your toe
and tap, tap, tap
Left and right,
left and then
'Round about
and back again
Oh, no!
This is terrible!
Hansel,
what are we going to do?
All the milk is spilt.
I must have left
the barn door open.
What are we going
to tell Mother?
I don't know.
Look, get it cleared up.
I'm getting him out of here.
Please, Duncan, move.
Come on.
Duncan, please.
Hansel, Gretel.
What are you doing?
What's the donkey
doing in the house?
Where's my custard?
We didn't see him coming in.
You let that stupid animal
eat my custard
and drink all our milk?
Hansel,
get that beast out of here.
Now. Do you hear?
Take the donkey to the barn,
you foolish boy.
Come on, Duncan.
Move, Duncan.
I'll take the donkey myself.
You're such
a worthless idiot.
Come on. Out.
I've had enough.
Just get out of my kitchen.
Get out of here. Out!
Out.
You stupid, stupid children.
I'll never forgive you,
never.
We're sorry. We really are.
Find some berries
for our dinner tonight.
Enough for all of us,
or don't come back.
Now get out of my sight.
Get out of here.
And don't even think
of coming back empty-handed
or I'll--
I'll--
Mama?
Go away. Leave me alone.
Come on.
Let's go over there,
where we always go.
There aren't any berries
left in those woods.
We've picked them all.
No one ever goes here.
But Papa said not to
come in these woods.
There's no path to follow.
We could get lost.
Have you still got
those cookie crumbs
the baker gave you?
Yes, but they're stale.
Good. Just enough.
We'll leave a trail of crumbs
so that we can find
our way back home.
And we won't get lost.
But Papa said--
Come on. Don't be a baby.
Look at all these berries.
They're so big and ripe.
Mmm, sweet, too.
Mother's going to be pleased.
A fairy plays her harp
in the wood all day
She wears a velvet mantle
of rose and grey
Where can this
good fairy be?
Playing pretty songs
for me
Maybe she lives
underneath an apple tree
Her hair is black as night
and her cheeks are red
She wears a cap of silver
upon her head
Where can this
good fairy be?
Waiting in the woods
for me
Maybe she lives
underneath a chocolate tree
There's no such thing
as a chocolate tree.
Yes, there is.
She dances in a circle
of warm sunlight
Her feet are very swift
and her eyes are bright
Where can this
sweet fairy be?
Dancing in the sun for me
Maybe she lives
underneath a chestnut tree
Maybe she lives underneath
a chestnut tree
Mother can't be
cross with us,
with all the berries
we've picked.
I've never made one
so lovely before.
Well, Princess,
shall we return
to our castle?
All we have to do
is follow our royal trail.
Our royal trail
of cookie crumbs.
Here's our trail.
Here's another one.
There's one.
Look, some more.
There's another one.
And another one.
Where's our trail?
It's gone.
I think we're lost.
Don't say that.
We'll find our way back.
I know we will.
Come on.
Oh, what a day,
Oh, what a day
Oh, what a happy man am I
Oh, what a bird,
Oh, what a breeze
Oh, what a joy
to see the sky
How did I know
how to be strong?
Where did I find
the voice to say?
No, not enough!
No, not at all!
No, not again! No, not today
This is how it should be,
This is how it is
A man gets what he wants
if he takes what is his
Oh, what a man,
Oh, what a man,
Oh, what a noble man am I
Oh, what a tree,
Oh, what a leaf
Oh, what a fence,
What a cottage,
What a flower
What a life
Maria, wake up.
This is no time
to take a nap.
Your husband's home
from his long trek to town.
Would you like to see
what I bought?
Aren't you glad
to welcome me home?
Welcome you home to what?
Nothing but troubles.
I have to keep the house,
feed the children.
On what? Nothing.
Well, then let us see
what we have to eat today.
Oh, Stephan, I'm in no mood
for your jokes.
I'm weary of living.
The cupboard is barren.
We have nothing.
Would a large jar of honey
make you less
weary of living?
Or wouldn't some flour
fill up our cupboard nicely?
How about some butter?
Butter?
Well,
where did this come from?
I demanded my money
from the baker
and he gave us every
last penny he owes us.
Oh, Stephan!
He's a hard man.
Did he give you any trouble?
Mmm, yes, well,
he put up a bit of a fuss,
but this time I didn't
let him off the hook
until I had
everything that I came for.
Tea.
Sausage.
Mmm.
Ham.
This must have
cost a fortune.
Where are the children?
Oh, those little scallywags.
Do you know what they did?
I left them alone,
and while I was gone,
they let the donkey
into the house.
He ate
an entire pan of custard
that I had made.
And broke
a pitcher of milk
that our neighbour
had given us
this very morning.
When I found them playing
with the donkey in the house,
I was so angry with them,
I sent them out
to pick berries.
There aren't many berries
left on the bushes
by the cottage.
We've eaten them all.
Yes, I know.
I couldn't find any myself.
But I was so angry.
They should be home by now.
You don't suppose
that they've gone into the...
The North Woods.
No, no. They wouldn't
have gone there.
I've told them 100 times
not to go
anywhere near there.
What have I done?
Heaven help us. My children!
Maria.
Hansel, Gretel,
where are you?
Hansel! Gretel!
Please come home.
I'm sorry.
It's too dark.
No one could find them
in that forest tonight.
Poor Hansel and Gretel.
My little babies.
lf anything should
happen to them,
I'd never forgive myself.
Don't blame yourself.
You were upset.
It's an evil forest.
Many children have
disappeared there.
There are no paths.
It's easy to become lost.
An old woman once told me
there's a witch who lives
deep in the North Woods
and demons as well.
Superstition.
Tonight, we will pray
for their safety.
Tomorrow, I will set out
and find them.
Come home.
Come on, little sparks.
Catch on fire.
Light these twigs.
I think we've got it.
Yes, we're going
to have a fire.
Mama? Papa?
I shouldn't have
listened to you.
I hope no goblin gets me.
No goblin will get you
while I'm around.
Sit close to me.
I'll protect you.
I dreamt that angels came
to protect us last night.
Beautiful angels.
A boy and a girl.
Maybe it wasn't a dream.
We're safe.
Mother and Father
must be very worried.
Time to go home.
I'm hungry.
I wish we still had
those berries.
Stephan. Stephan.
Please let me come with you.
No.
lf they find their way home,
it's best that you're here.
Look. Do you see that?
Yes. Yes, l--I see it.
Everything looks like
cookies and candies.
They are candies.
Hmm, lemon.
Hansel,
how can you be so bold?
Who knows who may live here?
Well, I don't see anyone.
Aren't you hungry?
Hmm.
So good.
Gretel, it's real.
The whole house is made
from cookies and candies.
Hansel, look, lemon sticks!
Welcome, children.
Oh, poor darlings,
you must be starved.
Oh, well, you've come
to the right place.
Everything here
is good to eat.
Oh, my name is Grizelda.
Come here, little pretty.
What is your name, child?
Gretel, ma'am.
And this is my brother,
Hansel.
Oh!
Gretel and Hansel.
Your house is so beautiful.
Well.
Are you a candy maker?
Oh, my, yes.
And a baker, too.
Sugar and spice
and everything nice
That's what
my house is made of
Gingerbread girls
with strawberry curls
That's what
my house is made of
So, please come inside
I'll help you decide
I'm full of
delicious surprises
And delicious disguises
I love to cook
and serve you little dears
So tender and slender
and hungry, it appears
Apricot custard
and lemon meringue
Raspberry strawberry torte
Butterscotch pudding
and apple soufflé
Marzipan, hazelnut,
mocha parfait
And if you want more
try the gingerbread door
My dears, my pie,
my apple-raisin tart
My cake, my best
I cross my chocolate heart
My house is yours
You're welcome
and you're sweet
So tender, so slender
You need some more to eat
Tender but slender
You need some more to eat
Some more to eat
Some more to eat
Some more to eat
To add some more meat
''No sooner had his lips
touched hers
''then Briar Rose
opened her eyes
woke up and smiled sweetly.''
Oh, Gretel, you are so sweet,
just like my candies.
Now where was l?
''They went
downstairs together.
''And then
the King and the Queen
and the whole court woke up.
And they all stared
at each other in amazement!''
Oh, poor little Hansel.
You are so painfully thin.
Here, won't you have
another doughnut?
Not at the moment, thank you.
My, what perfect
manners you have.
All right. Well,
I'll just put them over here.
You can have one
whenever you want one.
I made them
especially for you, children.
Oh, I'm so glad you children
decided to spend the night.
The whole court looked
at each other in amazement?
Just... Here.
''The horses stood up
and shook themselves.
''The flies on the wall
started crawling
and the fire in the kitchen
flamed up and cooked
the children.''
I mean, the chicken.
Cooked the chicken.
Are you children comfortable?
Would you like
four or five more pillows?
No, thank you.
Finish the story, please.
Yes, please.
Yes.
''The cook began
to roast again.
''The roast began
to cook again.
''And, uh,
the, uh, Prince and Briar Rose
''were married in splendour
and lived happily to the end
of their little lives.''
''Their long lives.'' Yes.
That was a good story.
Yes, yes.
Grizelda,
what's that you wear
around your neck?
Oh,
this is my eyeglass, child.
It helps me to
see things close up.
When I take my glass away,
I don't see quite as well.
That, that's what happens
when you get as old as me.
But my nose,
now that's a different story.
I have a very good
sense of smell.
It helps me to cook up
all my goodies.
Can I look through it?
Oh, no, no, dear.
It's fragile.
And Grandmother Grizelda
wouldn't want to
let it out of her sight.
Yes, good night,
my little cupcakes.
Sleep tight
and don't let
the bedbugs bite.
Could we have
pancakes and jam
for breakfast tomorrow,
Grandmother Grizelda?
Well,
of course you will, honey.
You can have anything
your plump little
heart desires.
You'll have
stacks and stacks of pancakes
and three kinds of jam.
And--and--and Gretel and l
will cook up
a wondrous breakfast.
Won't we, Gretel?
Yes, Grizelda.
Good night. And thank you.
You're welcome as pie.
Welcome as pie.
Good night, good night.
Good night, good night.
Hansel, you called
Grizelda ''Grandmother.''
But she's not our grandmother,
is she?
Our grandparents
are in heaven,
so she can be
our new grandmother.
Oh.
This bed is so comfortable.
It's like a cloud.
I wish we could
live here all the time.
What about Mother and Father?
Wouldn't you
like to live here
and eat the good things
Grizelda cooks
and have her read us
stories every night?
This is the most
wonderful house
in the whole world.
Hansel.
Hansel, wake up.
Put some more
marshmallow sauce
on my fudge.
Oh, Hansel.
''At the midnight hour
''when no one can see
''I speak my witch's chant

my witchy tricks

''Oh, how well I will dine

I know you're there.
I can smell you.
Hansel! Hansel!
Wake up! Hansel.
What is it?
She's a witch!
She's a witch!
''Hocus pocus, witch's spell
Rope entwine his body welI''
Hansel, run!
I can't. I can't move!
''Rope restrain him,
Gretel, behave
''He's my prey

''Hocus pocus,
''Roucus volus, hocus pocus

''And you'll eat by night
''And in a week

Hurry up, you little mouse.
You're not washing
fast enough to keep up
with the great Grizelda.
Well, let's see now.
Two and a half cups of milk.
Make the curd separately,
dust with flour...
Ooh, you're such
a lucky boy, Hansel.
I'm making you
a lemon-cream cake.
I don't want
anything from you.
Let me out of here!
Uh, boysenberry, elderberry,
blueberry,
ooh, firm pears,
crystallized ginger
and apple juice.
Hansel, a gingered pear pie?
Ooh, I've never made
one of those before.
Or what about my delicious
bread-and-butter pudding
with jam and meringue?
I'll eat no more
of your cooking, witch!
You'll eat what I tell you to,
when I tell you to.
The only time
I'll let your little sister
stop her chores,
is when you're eating.
Understand?
We've got to fatten
you up like a pig.
Gretel, wash that pie plate
and be quick about it.
You've still got
a whole barrel
of apples to do.
At that rate
you'll never finish!
Faster.
You're not getting tired
of my delicious pies
and puddings
are you, little Hansel?
Give me your finger.
Oh, my, my.
You still need
some more fattening up
before I bake you in my oven.
Hansel!
Gretel!
You're eating too slowly,
my little man.
Hurry up and finish.
Your sister has
lots of chores to do for me.
Let me see your finger again.
Ouch!
You're squeezing too hard.
Oh, I am, am l?
You're not quite fat enough,
but you're getting fatter.
Yes.
Well, soon you'll be fat
enough for me to eat you.
I'm getting tired.
It's been a long day.
Before I go to sleep,
I want you to eat some more
of my delicious sweet rolls.
I won't eat any more!
You can't make me!
You'll eat
whatever I give you,
or I will eat
your little sister.
She's not very big or plump,
but she'll do
for a midnight snack.
I'll boil her quickly
and eat her
right in front of your eyes.
I'm eating, I'm eating!
Don't hurt her!
Well, I'll have
no more trouble with you.
You'll eat whatever
Grizelda serves you!
Surprise!
A little something
different for you to enjoy.
A nice, fat chicken
for my little Hansel to eat.
And gobble it right up.
Eat it up, darling,
because I just can't
wait to have you
for my plump little chicken.
Gretel.
Gretel.
Shh.
Come close.
Run away from here.
No, Hansel,
I won't leave you.
All right.
We must be bold.
You must steal
her seeing glass.
But how?
She always wears it
around her neck.
Carefully.
Go on, it's now or never.
I can't eat much more
or I'll burst.
I can't work much more
or I'll fade away.
Oh, how I miss
Mother and Father.
So do l.
And to think I called
that witch ''Grandmother.''
What are you doing?
I'm--I'm just wiping
some crumbs off your apron.
It's almost morning.
You seem wide awake and eager
to begin your chores.
You'll start now.
I need walnuts!
You will shell and crush
a barrel of my finest walnuts!
Today there'll be
a storm of baking!
That's not the way
I showed you, you stupid girl.
We'll never get
anything done this way.
You just can't get
any good help anymore.
You fill a whole bowl full,
then you pound
the nutmeats like this.
And one and two,
and one and two,
and one and two.
But what are you pounding?
There's nothing there.
I am demonstrating
how to pound a pile of nuts.
I'm trying to show you
how it is done.
And one and two,
and one and two--
Oh!
Oh!
You idiot!
Look what you made me do.
I broke my precious eyeglass.
All right.
You'll just have to
work extra hard.
Go fill up
two buckets at the well.
I must fill my cauldron.
Help us, Gretel.
Help! We're trapped!
But how did you get in there?
Gretel, where is that water?
The witch.
She put us in here.
Be careful.
Gretel,
get in here right now!
Gretel,
what took you so long?
Fill the cauldron
and be quick about it.
Yes. Little Hansel.
Give me your finger,
little Hansel,
so that I may see
if you're fat enough
for me to cook up.
No eyeglass.
You don't seem
a bit fatter today.
ln fact, you seem thinner.
There's just no meat
on your bones!
Not even enough for me
to have a nice lunch!
Perhaps the two of them
together would
make one nice meal for me.
Gretel.
Today is the day we make
my special gingerbread.
Hansel, I heard them.
The gingerbread boys
and girls in her yard.
They're children, like us.
She wants to bake us into
a gingerbread cookie, too!
Shh. She's coming back.
Gretel, go to the oven
and open the door.
Close the door
when I tell you to.
We'll just test the batter
and make ourselves
a delicious duck cookie.
Close the oven door now!
Nice little ducky.
I'll eat you later.
You'll be my dessert.
There's something wrong
with the way
that fire is burning.
The batter is a bit crisp.
Well,
let's see how you turn out,
little Hansel.
Leave me
and my little sister alone,
you, you ugly, old witch!
Leave me and my poor,
little, idiot sister alone,
Miss Grizelda.
Gretel, run, run away!
''Hocus pocus, do my will
unlock his cage
and then be stilI''
Don't listen to her.
Run, run away.
Run, I tell you.
over here
''Come to me
my Hansel dear''
Gretel.
Gretel. Gretel, wake up!
''Hocus pocus,
their places switch
Make Grizelda
a gingerbread witch''
Hurray! The witch is gone.
We did it!
Hansel, come on.
Gretel,
the children.
Hurray! I'm free!
Oh, thank you,
Hansel and Gretel.
The witch's house!
The spell is broken.
The witch is dead!
Gretel, look.
The duck.
We're free.
We're not cookies anymore.
Come on, everybody.
Let's get out of
this dreadful place.
Father!
Papa!
Hansel.
Gretel.
My precious children.
Our prayers
have been answered.
There's so much to tell you.
There was a house
and a witch,
and she was
going to eat Hansel.
But Gretel saved me.
She was wonderful.
The children.
She turned them into cookies
but now they can return
safely to their parents.
Look, a treasure.
The witch's gold is ours!
We won't be poor anymore!
