This is Artie Decker,
De Voice of the Fresno Grizzlies...
Top of the ninth here at Chukchansi
Park, and a beautiful night.
We can actually feel
that fall is finally an its way.
We've got 15,000 sweaty and bloated
people all pumped up on Churros...
And Brad, this is why I love
announcing Minor League Baseball...
because I get to say names
like "River Cats..."
as they're having
a little meeting on the mound.
I sure do, Brad.
It's time for Artie's Kiss Cam!
There's our young Romeo now.
And whoa! He has scored!
Brad, that is what
you young people would call a "hotties."
He's got Britney Spears
and he's about to give her the ring...
and I'm sure she's
got a great "personality," but, oh my.
What's he doing
in the stands marrying him?
Here at Chukchansi Park,
love is blind, and apparently so is Nate.
Here's the situation.
First and third, two outs.
- You're out!
- Ballgame aver!
and as my mom used to say,
"There's no cure for dumb."
And that closes out
the last game of the season.
The Grizzlies take
the Sacramento River Cats...
I want to say thank you
for what has been an awesome semester.
I mean, you taught me a lot,
and... I got you this.
It's got all the famous calls
you told me about.
You know, that's really great,
Brad. Thank you so much.
I'm Artie Decker,
De Voice of the Fresno Grizzlies.
So, on behalf of Brad Zolick
and the late Gwen Foster on the organ...
good night everybody,
thanks for listening and lights out, Alice.
You're old school.
You reminisce and you tell stories.
- How many friends do you have?
- I don't have any friends.
- Have you made any posts?
- No.
- What was your last update?
- My what?
- Have you poked anybody?
- I haven't poked anybody!
- Has anybody poked you?
- No.
The thing is Artie,
even if you were connected...
I don't know that I'd want
to be poked by you.
- How many apps do you have?
- I don't have any apps.
- You don't have any apps?
- No.
- Everyone has apps.
- I don't have an app.
- Do you play Angry Birds?
- Angry Birds?
Are you out of your mind?
What the heck are you talking about?
I'll tweet.
I'll make whatever noise you want.
- Yeah.
- Funny.
All right, everybody,
pull your core in.
You know, Artie,
this could turn out to be a good thing.
You mean me wearing a captain's
hat following you around Costco?
You were offered a job
teaching broadcasting at Fresno State.
I could,
but why should they know what I know?
I don't want to teach,
I want to do. I still have the dream.
Yeah, the Giants.
I've been chasing this job for 35 years.
So basically, you're asking
a 38-year-old to retire.
Artie, to me, you're the best
announcer in the whole world.
something tells me
they don't have you on speed dial.
- It'll be okay.
-l'm sorry.
Well, I can have that up for
you in about three hours.
Yeah, one hour,
that's what I meant. Sure, I can hold on.
- What's the matter, honey?
- I missed a note.
Come and have breakfast.
You're going to get it.
I'm the soy sages,
Turner gets the Wheatie-O's.
- I'm on a call.
-l'm on a call.
But-but M-Mom! Th-The other
k-kids are going to w-watch them.
Honey, I don't think you'd
really enjoy the Saw movies.
I can't believe it.
My computer just crashed.
Barker, can we discuss
some of the many other possibilities...
for today's wardrobe,
including some involving pants?
Honey, can I talk to you outside
for a second?
I mean, the whole thing.
Moving to Atlanta for my job.
Well, guess what.
That was my boss on the phone...
Five days of lectures
and networking and love.
We're supposed
to take the kids to the symphony--
Honey, we haven't had a
vacation since Barker was born.
- That's five years.
- Mmm-hmm.
This conversation is the longest we've been
alone in months.
So, great.
I'll call my parents, they'll fly down.
They'll be happy
to watch the kids while we're gone.
The one that we bought them
for their 40th anniversary.
Yeah. They haven't seen the kids
in what, a year?
- They're not coming.
- Don't you need to talk to them first?
You know that they're just going to
say that they can't make it.
- What?
- The itch.
You're kidding.
You're getting your "Artie and Diane Rash"?
Have you forgotten how they disapprove
of the way that we parent?
My father doesn't listen.
My mother, she's a tornado with lipstick.
who's going to be with you
in the Hilton Head?
I'm going to love you
till the police come
Toilet over? Owing.
Bathroom ?ooded.
- Hello?
- Hi, Dad.
- Alice, how are you?
-ls Mom around?
- Oh, my.
- I got it.
- Put her on hold.
- I know.
- Put her on hold.
-l'm trying.
- Put her on hold.
- I can't.
- Put her on hold.
- You're making me tense.
Phil has to go away
next week and I'd really like to go with him.
Artie, we practically
never see our grandchildren.
These three kids are the only
grandchildren we're ever going to have.
I'm awkward around those kids.
I don't think they like me.
They have to know you better
before they don't like you.
No, but it's a real thing, Di.
And it all comes from Alice.
Like the last time,
the little one left the house...
Sol made a little joke.
I said, "This one, any hope for normal?"
it might be a good thing
if you learned "the little one's" name.
I don't need Alice's disapproval.
I'm not going.
- You're going.
- That's what I meant.
Her whole way of raising
her kids is a giant...
If you haven't found
it yet, it's not there. I'll help you out.
- Come on!
- He's not done groping.
And could she
have found anyone less like me to marry?
What's your
problem with Phil? He's such a sweet guy.
Scattered showers, honey.
It'll be over in 20 minutes.
- What's it an omen of?
- Impending doom.
- I have a great idea.
- What's that?
- You know what grand parenting is?
- What?
- And you know what Alice told me?
- What?
The kids are over-the-moon excited
about our coming.
Because they're your grandparents
and they love you.
Well, Grandma made them.
And she thinks you like them.
Just laugh and I promise you
we'll get through this week.
Oh, my goodness!
They're wearing their shirts.
This one's going to be prettier
than her grandma.
- Harper.
- I know.
- How's the fiddle coming? Still fiddling?
- Mmm-hmm.
He just wanted to make sure
you had food here for him.
Hey, if you think
that's something, wait until you see this.
Hey, you know what?
Since we're all going to be pals now...
instead of calling me
"Grandpa," why don't you call me "Artie"?
So it's "Grandma and Artie"
now? What are you, my boyfriend?
No, listen. We went through
all those names last time.
I don't want to be "Mup-Mup,"
or "Bup-Bup," or "Boop-Boop."
My name is Artie.
Always been Artie. Call me Artie.
Hey, that was a put-down.
You owe me three put-ups.
I like your shoes.
I like your shirt. I like your hair.
- It's a prototype.
- Prototype?
Welcome, Alice and
Phil and Harper and Turner and Barker and...
It's Phil's invention.
It's what he's worked on all this time.
This is the brain centre
to this fully automated...
And I'm just going to enter you two
into the system right now.
and if there are any problems,
Turner understands the whole system.
Well, if Turner can do it,
I certainly can't.
- Really?
- Yeah.
"Lights out, Alice,"
and it sort of stuck, you know?
That's so hot!
What are you doing? It's too hot!
- Do you realize what we are?
- What?
And who's putting those pictures
on the mantle?
I don't think the kids
even know what I do. Or did.
- What about me?
- That's your problem.
- New people.
- Hello.
These are my parents.
They're going to watch the kids this week.
My mother's Japanese,
my father's Chinese...
my kids are Korean
and they go to Hebrew day school.
- Who's Carl?
- Barker's friend.
Maybe we should have eaten
at the Outback.
He's in a real
"testing the boundaries" phase.
Now, do you have any
special instructions for us?
Like, what the kids like to do,
what they like to eat.
That's the saddest thing
I've ever heard in my life.
We have tried to introduce
just a little bit of sugar...
and it was like going off the rails
of the crazy train.
And there's another subject
I'd like to discuss.
You see, there's a way
that we talk to our kids.
we would say,
"Consider the consequences."
"Quit your whining,
you're giving me a headache"...
Honey, draw whatever
your imagination tells you.
But what's the point
of having lines if you're just going to...?
That's beautiful.
That's absolutely beautiful.
- Picasso.
- Exactly.
You didn't finish your dinner.
You know the great thing about Chinese...
I mean, Pan Asian food,
is that if you mush it all up it's...
- What did you do?
- I don't know.
- What?
- Use your words, Barker.
- Just get in the car.
- I am trying.
- Get in the car.
- I love you.
- Go.
- Yay!
Barker's hyperventilating.
Stop the car, please.
- Go, go, go!
- Yay!
Then anything short of that will be
a happy surprise.
- Really go now.
- No!
Time for breakfast.
Come on, we got to get to school.
It's going to be great!
It's going to be awesome!
This is going to be
the best week of your life!
- Right, Artie?
- Sure thing, Regis.
Okay. Here we go.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.
Did Mom leave my
eggless egg salad for lunch?
Eggless egg salad?
How would I recognize it?
I know. It's on the counter.
Make the sandwiches.
N-Not too much almond milk
in the c-cereal. It g-gets too wet.
- Is this the right amount?
- Uh-uh.
and put one piece in each hole
in the multigrain waffle.
Now there's no sandwich.
Look what you made.
And your opinion has value.
And, what's the other one?
But I know from experience
that wearing heels can be tricky.
Wouldn't you and Carl
both be more comfortable in sneakers?
Hey, what's going on?
We are going to be late.
l tried handling
it like Alice said, but it's not working.
All right,
get the other two in the car, I'll handle this.
Take off those shoes
and I'll give you a dollar.
- Five.
- Two-fifty.
Why is this easier than
you just telling me how to get there?
- l heard that.
- Whoa! Whoa!
Yeah, it's interesting
because, usually, jokes are funny.
- Thank you.
- What?
."Go garage-"
.Go garage-
They need me to update
their website immediately.
No, it's ESPN.
There's a crisis with the X Games.
Yeah, I'm one of their web
designers. Honey, get in the backseat.
- Really?
Mmm-hmm.
Grandma and I are going
to buy Harper a dress.
You know, she has HAS.
High Achievement Syndrome.
I know she's a little tightly wound.
But we're working on it.
W-W-Watch where you're going,
Tu-Tu-Tu-Turner.
He had one,
and now he has a new one, Dr. Jimmy.
But then pick me up here.
Don't leave me stranded.
Boy, this is harder than
one of your grandma's bras.
- Hey, Ash.
- Hey, Cody.
- Did you get my Evite?
- Yep, I'm coming.
- Hey.
- Hi.
So, if you want to swing by,
that would be pretty cool.
- She has a thing.
- I got a thing.
Well, if you change your mind,
just, you know...
Welcome back,
Artie Decker.
Why couldn't that
work have been done at Hilton Head?
this was my favourite time of the day,
right after school.
put on her mother's clothes,
blast music and smoke.
Honey, you're really
starting to take control...
that I have professional experience
in this area.
Oh, wonderful.
Where did you receive your degree?
I speak for a living.
I'm a baseball announcer.
Little different than a PhD
in speech therapy from Yale. Right?
But on the other hand,
I sat here for almost an hour...
and I saw these kids
do everything but speak.
Because a lot of those jobs
are being shipped overseas.
Okay. I am employing
the Houghton method.
Now these kids, they're under
too much pressure to speak...
so we make it very
clear that in here, they need not say a word.
He is listening to the words
that he has trouble with...
and then when
he's comfortable, he can repeat them.
and frankly, I don't see
any improvement at all.
Cassandra's just telling me
how great you're doing.
Sometimes I shouldn't move my lips.
I'm sorry.
"Not bad"?
She looks like a 12-year-old widow.
- I do?
- You do.
But that's perfect
for a classical music program.
This is perfect for someone
with a cute little hiney.
Mom, it's for a concert,
not to meet the fleet.
Hey, it's an audition,
and all auditions are alike.
Remember our winter song?
That was our best one.
I love you. Come on, please.
No one's watching.
Button up your overcoat
in the wintry breeze
Take good care of yourself
'cause it's nine degrees!
Okay.
I'll never shop at Bloomingdale's again.
you've got to try this on.
I'm dying to see this on you.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Mom. She cannot wear
a cocktail dress to the audition.
Oh, I'm sorry, honey.
Did you say something?
Exit shoes, to walk away
and not use a red voice.
Super-mad sounding.
You shouldn't use it. Never.
- Uh-huh.
- That's why you have a cool toolbox.
All right, so I am taking a repair
square out of my cool toolbox...
- Would you like five dollars?
- No.
An unopened package
of men's size 34 underwear?
Is there anything I can do
to make this right?
and you don't tell Mommy
about the movie...
Incoming
message. Urgent e-mail from "E-spend. "
What a great day.
It's like a birthday that came early.
The catfish just jumped
right into your frying pan.
He heard about your X Games
and he would love to audition.
I'm just walking in.
Video chat me in 2 minutes, okay?
Hi, Artie, we're back!
Did you have fun with the boys?
Look at this place!
We're going to have to call FEMA!
- Where's Artie?
- He left!
- What?
- It was nothing.
I can't wait for
you to get here, me little rabbit.
- Did he have a tattoo?
- Hmm?
- My favourite!
- Harper!
This perfectly sums up
your entire approach to parenting.
Would Artie and
Turner like to continue watching Saw?
Because he does what he wants
and she defends him!
Oh, I put them
on the treadmill until they calm down.
Maybe it's just a case
of first-day, worst-day.
Hey. You better hurry up.
You're going to miss your flight.
I said, "Artie,
this is a second chance for us."
I said, "Artie, I really want
those kids to love us!"
Or can't you remember
all the way back to yesterday?
When the cake
went in their mouths they loved me!
Yeah, and now Alice
doesn't want to leave us alone with them.
I accidentally overheard her
when I was listening at the door.
This will not be good enough
for your audition!
When my daughter underperforms,
I shun her.
Wasn't she the villain
in the last James Bond movie?
You know back in Amarillo,
when Artie was announcing there...
I got this audition
to be the local weather girl.
Artie took me out the night before and we
both got bombed!
You could have some fun Friday night.
You know?
I have three more days!
I have to practice! I have to--
if you ever speak
to my granddaughter like that again...
He likes sports.
He likes science, he likes movies.
Well, you know, kids have a way
of working these things out.
But then you hit puberty
and you got all girlie on me.
Well, gee, Dad,
I'm so sorry that I hit puberty.
Do you remember that summer
when you worked for me in the booth...
I was on the air.
I didn't want to start a panic.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Strike one!
Hey, he is really good. He's really good.
a young Cuban prospect
who escaped on a raft.
to the dugout
for this eight-year-old bullfrog.
The yearbook said
Ivan is "Most likely to do time."
Strike three!
You're out of there!
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Blue, Blue! That's three strikes!
- Seriously?
- Seriously.
- Dad, why don't we just sit down?
- Oh...
'Cause it's one, two,
three strikes, you're out...
He's right!
I hate these games! What's the point?
The point is for the kids
to enjoy the game without competition.
I mean, how do you even
know who's winning?
And there's plenty of time
in their lives to keep score!
- And you are out!
- No, I'm not.
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.
- You're out.
- No, I'm not!
- You're out!
- No, I'm not!
- Three strikes, you're out!
- No, I'm not!
- You're out!
- No, you're out!
Ivan, no hitting!
Use your words!
All I saw was
that little monster grab a baseball bat...
- It was my fault.
- Oh, honey.
- Phil?
- Hey.
- Daddy won!
- Congrats, Dad!
So, they're
giving me the award tomorrow night.
You don't know
what's going on here. It's madness.
We can't leave our children
with my parents.
So, what are you saying?
That you're not coming?
bent over backwards
to try to do things your way.
and you haven't given
us the chance to do it.
You have been on our backs,
especially your dad's...
Okay, take his side,
because you always do anyway.
Alice, I know
you're trying to be a perfect parent...
he's not just their father,
he's also your husband.
Alice, I'm your mom.
Take it from me, I really get it.
Well, your husband's dream
is coming true...
and part of that dream
is you being there with him!
Going to stand
there gawking? Going to let me in?
No score here in the bottom
of the seventh with 2 outs.
The Giants and the Atlanta
Braves locked into a pitching duel.
Lincecum and Hudson,
both have been fantastic.
As Buster Posey steps in,
takes a strike in the inside corner.
I got to tell you friends,
this is one of those nights...
72 degrees, 45,000 fans,
smell of the popcorn, the hot dogs...
all of those clichés,
but I'll tell you something...
Posey hits
a line drive to third and that'll do it.
We'll be back. This is Artie Decker,
De Voice of the Giants.
Oh, and you're such
a pleasure in the morning?
I got to go number two!
I got to go number two!
No, no, he can hold it, guys.
He's fine, he can hold it!
- Hey, buddy.
- Sorry!
- Hurry up!
- Yeah.
- Gr-Grandma?
- Yes, dear?
- Stop it!
- Barker!
- Over there!
- Barker!
- Artie?
-l'm sorry!
This whole "teachable moments"
and protecting their self-esteem...
All I hear is
"Use your words. Use your words".
But the word
they never use with these kids is "no"!
The other patients
are waiting for you in Arts and Crafts.
Yeah, Artie Decker.
You're going to love him. He's a pro's pro.
Market research.
Always at dinner time. How do they know?
I have something I want to clear up.
Something's bothering me.
I was never, ever
going to actually spank Barker.
- But he didn't know that.
- That's why it worked.
- There we go!
- It looks great!
We all sit at one table
and we all eat the same thing.
Grandma worked very hard
to make your mom's recipe...
so I think that we owe her the
courtesy of eating it and enjoying it.
That looks like fun.
Do you just press it here?
You ever watch the X Games?
Stuff like that?
You mean like "h-heinous,"
or "gn-gnarled out," or "n-nose bone"?
Listen, how about later I tuck you
in and we talk more about this?
S-Sure. Except for the t-tucking in.
I'm eight.
And, listen, I'm sorry
if l embarrassed you the other day.
Anything he starts,
you can finish. Believe in yourself.
And once you believe
in yourself, you can do anything.
You can look trouble right in the eye
and just wink at it.
And everything will be okay.
It's all attitude.
Goodbye, Harper,
Turner, Barker, Diane and Farty Decker.
Remember, you're taking Barker
for a play date.
Alice says this is very,
very important.
and Barker hasn't had
a chance to make new friends, okay?
- No.
- How will I know how to get there?
Use the R-life.
Turner already punched in the address.
Okay. Di, can you pick up
Barker after the play date?
Pick him up? You're supposed
to stay with him the whole time.
What? When did his play date
become my play date?
- Bye.
- Bye. Have fun!
We're going to
have a great time at the play date!
Would you like to do something fun
with me?
Do you guys want to go
to the skate park later?
and it was such an awkward silence.
I had no idea what to say.
So, Tony, are you
going to bust a 900 today, dude?
Or are you going show us
something that's going to blow our minds.
and then give you a tattoo
right in the middle of it.
I don't have
a song for that.
Talk a little bit about that
particular night and you hitting the 900.
Hey, I'm here.
Sorry I'm late. Motorcycle trouble.
I'm Artie "Mad Dog" Decker!
What's up, home slice?
- Who's the kid?
- This is my agent.
- That's it.
- Okay, dope.
I promise you,
everything's going to be good.
and I promise
you can do all the peeing that you want.
- But we really--
- Shh!
- Ready?
- Yeah, yeah, coming.
- Okay.
- Go! Go, go.
It's a beautiful day
and thanks for coming out!
- Here's one--
Cut!
- What?
- He's finished. The run's over.
Give me one more chance.
I'm just warming up.
It is on
and it is epic.
We're expecting to see
a front side heel flip 540...
Can I ask you something?
I wonder about this.
- Absolutely.
- How do you practice these tricks...
Do you say, "I'm just
going to do this. Somebody get a mop"?
- I saved it up.
- When? Since birth?
What you did back there
was pretty dangerous.
I don't think Carl is being
a very good friend to you.
For a kangaroo,
he's something of a thrill-seeker.
And I think it's time
that you start telling Carl what to do.
watch after you today,
and I didn't do a good job.
you don't tell
anyone what happened. Okay?
- How could you?
- What?
I'm talking about Turner
and that brilliant advice you gave him.
- No.
- Why not?
He started screaming
and s-someone helped him fight me.
When I said stand
up for yourself, I didn't mean hitting.
Oh, boy. The older I get,
the lower the floor gets.
Just between me and you.
No one else knows this.
When I was your age,
I was very shy because I was short.
You know, the way
I feel about myself, was really bad.
I knew that I had to become
a baseball announcer.
it didn't matter what anybody
else thought or said about me.
Brooklyn Dodgers,
New York Giants.
Well, the baseball season ends
and they're tied.
and a batter
named Bobby Thomson comes up to bat.
Bobby Thomson
up there swinging.
Lock man without
too big of a lead at second“
but he 'll be running like the wind
if Thomson hits one.
There's a long drive!
It's going to be, I believe--
The Giants win the pennant!
The Giants win the pennant!
Bobby Thomson hits
into the lower deck of the left field stands!
Now the big dream,
of course, was to announce for the Giants.
Bobby Thomson
up there swinging.
a single and a double,
and Billy Cox is playing--
Honey, we're going to play a
game. You want to join us?
- Grandma, I can't.
- Why?
then I won't get into
the Atlanta Youth Symphony...
which offers a graduate class
with Sarah Chang...
which is the orchestra
I most want to play in.
- Sweetheart.
- Yes.
- Ah!
- Ooh!
- I got more ice.
- Oh, thank you, honey.
I know my
audition is tomorrow, but I practiced all day.
And you said I should relax
the night before...
It's the first party
I've been invited to since we moved.
came right back home,
got a really good night's sleep?
- Every week?
- Yes.
The child
that was involved was not injured.
and ti? ere '5 this kid up ti? ere
just whizzing a way.
I hit his stream
and l fishtailed, and now it's on YouTube.
And when l asked what he was
doing, you know what he said?
This is from Tony Hawk's practice
run this morning at the X Games.
And guess what? I ordered
Chinese“ I mean, Pan Asian, for dinner.
When you come down,
we're going to arm-wrestle Grandma.
- It's not too late.
- Oh!
It's really late. Come here,
I want to show you something.
- What?
- Look at this.
- That's Alice's song.
- Yeah.
She was, like, three or four years
old, how did she remember?
I don't know,
but it's at the top of her playlist.
- Wow.
- Aw!
We must have sang that song
a thousand times to her in the car!
- You know you want to.
- I don't want to sing it.
Oh, I wonder, wonder,
whom-ba-doo-hoo-whom
Tell me, tell me, tell me
Oh, who wrote the book of love?
l got to know the answer
was it someone from above?
Oh, I wonder, wonder,
whom ba-doo-hoo-whom.
you're never
never never never ever going to part
Oh, I wonder, wonder,
whom-ba-doo-hoo-whom
- Oh!
- Oh, boy.
Artie, what do you think
of your granddaughter now?
- Wow. Ooh.
- Oh!
Carl says we should go outside
and play again!
You're the boss of Carl.
You tell him what to do.
- Stop!
- What's wrong?
He ran away.
He said he's never coming back.
Oh, he'll come back.
He has to pick up his mail.
- Barker!
- Carl!
- Barker, are you okay?
- He's fine.
- That wasn't Carl, that was you!
- Shut up!
It's your fault! You made me get
into a fight with him!
We were cruising
and heard the alarm. ls everyone okay?
- Oh, hi!
- Mommy!
- Was there a break-in?
- It's nothing.
It's absolutely nothing.
What are you doing home?
- What?
- You killed Carl? How?
- Yes!
- No!
We leave and she's 12,
we come home and she's 16.
You know, you're not supposed
to be back until tomorrow.
as to why Barker was nearly
killed this morning at the X Games!
Barker was at a play date
this morning with Artie.
and I had to take him
with me on some business.
What business did you have
at the X Games?
Aren't we forgetting
the most serious issue here?
Would someone please explain
what happened to Carl?
and it started to rain,
so we all came indoors...
and I was helping
Harper get dressed for her party.
The night before your audition?
Are you kidding?
never doing anything else
and auditioning for a school tomorrow...
Harper. Harper!
I cannot allow you to take a talent...
a gift to which you have
dedicated so much time and effort...
I hate you and I wish
anyone else was my mother!
I couldn't have
gotten through the week without you.
Don't even take our clothes
we just skedaddle.
Wherever you needed to be,
that's where I was.
This week was supposed to be about
us and our grandchildren.
You know, it may not have been
horrible to let her go to that party.
You know, they didn't kill
Carl, only Barker could do that.
And it somehow took us
not being here for him to do it.
that this trip would help bring
her closer to her grandchildren.
and I don't want
to see that end just because I screwed up.
- What about you?
- Hmm?
Don't you want a relationship
with your grandchildren?
like an hour
before you came home, it was really good.
- Twenty-six.
- Mmm-hmm.
And I was terrified, because you didn't
come with any instructions.
Because unlike my father,
I wasn't constantly telling you...
what an annoying little waste
of time you were...
And I thought that we were
actually having fun.
and the cutest little girl you ever saw,
travelling around the country.
But then years go by,
and your daughter goes off to college...
and she doesn't come home
for Thanksgiving or Christmas.
that perhaps all those years
she wasn't having such a good time...
and that maybe she thought
you didn't do such a good job.
So, little girl,
I have to give you three put-ups.
- No, Dad.
- Please.
They're great kids
and you're a really good mother.
I'm basking in the glow
of my children's affection.
Barker has a special request
for tomorrow, before the audition.
Carl, your two favourite things were milk
and tofu dogs.
How do you say goodbye
to somebody you could never say hello to?
Carl wasn't just Barker's friend,
he was a part of him.
Alice, you take Harper backstage.
We'll grab some seats.
- Good luck.
- Knock them dead.
Welcome family, friends
and distinguished judges...
all vying for one position
at this prestigious conservatory.
You know,
when you were just five years old...
we took you to that
little music school for the first time.
And all the other kids
they were just banging on things.
you had this look
of such fulfilment on your face.
So, honey, do you
really not want to switch schools again?
That's good
because you're my only daughter.
And you know,
I don't really understand the boys.
We regret to inform you
of a slight change in our program.
we're going to have to take
a 10 minute break.
I came 3,000 miles
to ruin my granddaughter's life.
- Really?
- It was our choice.
He's had two out of three,
a single and a double...
and Billy Cox is playing him
right and the third base line.
Bobby Thomson takes a strike
called on the inside corner.
and he drove in
the Giants first run with a long ?y to centre.
Lock man without
too big of a lead at second...
but he 'll be
running like the wind if Thomson hits one.
There's a long drive!
It's going to be, I believe--
The Giants win the pennant!
The Giants win the pennant!
How much would it
embarrass you if l kissed you right now?
My friends, it's taken me over 35 years
to say these words...
Giants are out in the field.
There's Charlie "The Naz" Naznic...
Yes, Art. Let's see
if Naz can get his team out of a jam.
Sherman's got a glove down.
No, he stopped to pick his nose.
Now, Douglas is sitting down
and taking off his shoes...
because his mom said to me
before the game...
Sherman still working
on that thing in his nose.
Sherman has the booger!
Sherman has the booger!
The other players are coming over
to examine it.
Wow, you could take
an aerial photograph of that thing!
I'm sure there's going
to be orange slices in the locker room...
Meanwhile, Naz scores.
And that is another home run!
- Whoo!
- Go Barker!
Our next batter is coming
up to the plate.
Young man with incredible
power. Three-foot-four and 45 pounds.
{got to
tell your friends, this is one of those days
Seventy-eight degrees,
the sold out crowd of 56' fans...
But I'll tell you something,
there's no other place I'd rather be.
Andes my grandson Barker
said to me this morning...
This is Artie Decker,
De Voice of the Peewee Giants..
Settle dawn,
it'll all be clear
Don '1' pay no mind
to the demons
'Cause I'm going to make
this place your home
Um...
Andy? Andy, there's no paper.
