GEORGE: Survival
of the fittest, Son.
ERNIE: The law
of the forest, right?
Right.
Of course,
your new rifle gives you
a little edge.
Dad, do you hear...
Be real quiet.
Lunch!
And I killed it!
Nancy!
Will you look at the size
of this thing?
There's no way
I'm eating a dead rabbit.
I thought you said
we were leaving.
Will this never end?
Start the fire, Nan.
We are leaving.
Before lunch.
George, what happened to
"home before dark.
Grab a bite on the way"?
Come on, Nan,
we gotta cook it.
It's Ernie's first kill.
Yeah, it's my first blood.
I hope
you're proud of yourself.
Look, we'll stuff it. Okay?
You're a butcher, Ernie.
Back off, Sarah!
It was him or me!
SARAH:
I don't feel very good.
ERNIE: Pull over, Dad,
she's gonna launch.
GEORGE: Ernest.
NANCY: Open the window, honey,
a little air
will do us all some good.
SARAH: It's the fish.
Ernie, close the cooler.
NANCY: Ernie, what are you
doing in the fish?
Looking for
my baseball glove.
Hey, Dad.
Yeah.
Do you think I can get
a pair of real major league
baseball cleats
when we get back?
You bet.
Great. I'm gonna
spike Frankie McDowell.
NANCY: No, you're not.
Listen to your Mom, Ern.
But he spiked me twice!
That's different.
You go right ahead then.
George.
Nan, you don't understand
these things.
It's just smart baseball.
Hey, hey.
Be careful of my drawings
back there.
And don't step
on the trout.
Or my flowers.
They're still alive.
Or Mom's flowers.
Oh, Nan, don't you love
roughing it in the wild?
"Roughing it," George?
The only thing rough
about it was when
the generator went out
in the middle
of Masterpiece Theatre:
Whoa!
George, please, slow down.
I know these roads
like the back of my hand.
And I know Seattle's
not going anywhere.
Want your sunglasses,
George?
No, I'm fine, dear.
Mom, Ernie's playing
with that gun again.
Ernie, don't even
touch that gun.
It's a rifle, girls.
If you can shoot with it,
it's a gun.
Oh, my God! Look at that deer!
Did you see that, Sarah?
No, I missed it.
I always miss everything.
Hey, Dad.
Yeah.
Maybe there's a chance
you can blast something.
Ernie, don't give Daddy
any ideas. I could not
face two stuffed bunnies.
Did I bring my rifle
this time?
Did I? No.
You're right, George,
we'll always remember this
as our first camping trip
when Ernie killed something
and you didn't.
My God!
My God.
I thought I hit a man!
Is everybody all right, Nancy?
Okay, kids?
Sarah, are you all right?
Yeah.
George, what is it?
I don't know.
I hardly saw it.
But it's gotta be a bear.
Could it be a gorilla?
I don't think
they get that big around here,
SARAH: I think we should
just get out of here, Dad.
What if it's still alive?
What if it's in pain?
If it's still alive,
it's probably not
in a very good mood.
No way it's alive!
You trashed him, Dad.
There's probably
guts and eyeballs
hanging off the bumper.
Knock it off, Ern.
We can't just leave it
in the road, suffering.
ERNIE: Cool. Look.
Everybody,
stay in the car.
Son of a bitch.
You drive a classic, you try
to take good care of it,
and some dumb animal...
George, shouldn't
we call a Ranger?
No, not yet.
ERNIE: You did bring it.
Don't you need some backup?
No.
I said stay in the car.
This is exactly
why I brought it.
For protection.
You didn't have to lie.
ERNIE: Shoot it!
It's dead.
Shoot it anyway!
Nan!
What?
I think you better come
take a look at this!
Dad.
Yeah?
What if it's him?
Who?
Bigfoot.
Bigfoot?
Holy shit! Sorry, Dad.
That's okay.
I was looking
for the right words.
It smells gross!
George, what is it?
I guess it must be
a Bigfoot.
I don't know
what else it could be.
Nancy, this is a big deal.
It's a major discovery.
I bet a museum
would want it or something.
We have to take it home.
Ernie, you and your sister go
take the stuff off the top of
the car, put it in the back.
Right, Dad.
And tell your sister
she's gonna have to
help us lift this thing up!
Oh, Sarah!
Pull it forward!
Don't worry.
NANCY: I feel so guilty.
What if
it's the only one?
It's not as if
I tried to hit it, Nan.
It was just luck.
Luck?
What if we've just rendered
an entire species extinct?
One of a kind?
This thing could
really be worth something.
I don't believe
you just said that.
Come on, Nan.
It's all in
how you look at it.
It's alive!
Dad!
Did you see
those big honking teeth?
Ernest.
Get me my rifle.
George.
What are you gonna do?
Be careful.
It's still loaded.
George, you're not
going out there?
We can't just leave it
in the road, can we?
What if it's suffering?
Sorry.
It's dead!
Are you sure?
Yeah.
Are you really sure?
I'm really sure!
Remember,
you were sure before.
Nancy, I'm not a doctor,
but it has no pulse,
it's not breathing
and it's cold as a popsicle.
Believe me, honey,
whatever it is,
it's definitely dead!
Help!
Somebody!
Help!
Ernie, get your mother!
Quick!
All right. I knew
you weren't dead!
Not yet I'm not!
Not you, Dad, him!
Help!
George, what...
Are you all right?
Nancy, get my rifle, quick!
What...
What are you...
George!
Sarah, don't come in here!
Oh, my God!
Horrible smell!
Nancy, do something!
Be very careful.
What are you doing?
Oh, God!
GEORGE: That's brilliant.
Come on, everybody,
let's get out of here! Quick.
Come on, Sarah.
No!
Mom, my corsage!
No.
My orchid!
It's eating
my fifteenth birthday corsage!
Sarah!
The one I saved
for over six whole months!
I was gonna
keep that flower
for the rest of my life!
And you ate it!
Sarah!
I don't care
how big and ugly
and smelly you are.
You just can't go around
eating other people's
corsages!
That was a bad thing you did!
A bad, bad thing!
Do you hear me?
Even if you are an animal!
You just can't go around
acting like one in this house!
Let's get out
of here, now!
Boy, Sarah.
You really pissed him off!
Shut up.
Shh! Both of you!
Come on, it's going
in the dining room!
Wow!
That's great,
that's just great!
George, he's eating my plant.
Look, he's eating my plants!
No!
He's eating
my Passiflora coriaceas:
Stop that!
GEORGE: Oh, God!
Uh-oh.
Oh, dear.
Okay, that's it!
George! Can't we
just call somebody?
George, what's that for?
I know what I'm doing.
Oh, George!
I'm not gonna stand around
while some animal
destroys our house!
Dad, it's not an animal!
George?
George?
I'm okay.
Everybody, get up here!
Quick! Quick!
What's it doing?
It's burying
Grandma's mink stole.
Don't you look at me
like that!
Why are you all
looking at me like that?
I didn't kill
the poor little things.
Grandma didn't kill them!
Some ranchers raised them
and killed them.
And they only did
that because they knew
somebody would buy them.
GEORGE: Come on, quick,
everybody back
into the house!
All right,
everybody out!
GEORGE: Uh-oh.
Keep an eye on him!
"Keep an eye on him,"
George?
Lock the door!
Yeah.
George, he's coming back!
Stall him!
I can't! How?
I don't know!
Show him the pasta maker.
George!
Not yet!
George!
He really wants
to come in now.
George!
Company!
Downtown. Sergeant Mancini.
Sergeant, my name is
George Henderson.
I'm at 437 Manning Drive.
I wanna report a...
Something in my house.
What kind of something,
Mr.: Henderson?
Some... A big... Something.
My family's
in terrible danger.
In danger?
Mr. Henderson,
do you have someone
in your house?
A burglar, a prowler?
No, don't think
I'm crazy, Sergeant,
but it's Bigfoot.
Of course, yes.
They can be a nuisance,
I'll tell you what,
Mr.: Henderson:
It kind of happens
all the time around here:
Now, we found these Bigfeet
are pretty reasonable fellows:
Hey!
Look, I hit a Bigfoot
with my car.
I thought it was dead.
I was gonna call
in the morning,
but it must have been hungry
'cause I found it
in the kitchen!
You hit a Bigfoot
with your car...
No! Yes.
... in your kitchen:
Look, I'm under
a lot of stress here,
I mean, it wasn't dead
anymore. It must have
just walked into the kitchen.
It was eating
out of our refrigerator.
I thought it was gonna eat me,
but it ate my daughter's
corsage instead.
And then
our Passiflora coriacea
and then it ate our goldfish.
And where is it now,
Mr. Henderson?
It's in the bathroom.
Of course, how stupid of me.
Hey, look, just say I believe
you have a Bigfoot
in your house.
First we cordon off
your neighborhood.
Second, we evacuate
your neighbors,
and third, we send
a whole shit-load
of cops in there
to deal with the thing:
I mean, fully armed
and ready, Mr.: Henderson:
So unless you wanna
be responsible
for wrongfully
turning your neighborhood
into a war zone
I suggest
you drop this whole thing
right now.
A war zone?
Very well, then.
No, no, no Bigfoot here,
Sergeant. I was just joking.
Sorry, it's just a prank.
I'm not even George Henderson.
You must have reached
the wrong number.
We're on our own.
No, no, Sergeant,
no Bigfoot here.
Irene.
Fine. Wonderful time.
What? No, wait!
It's Irene!
She's bringing the dog back.
I couldn't stop her!
I'll meet her halfway.
IRENE: Nance!
It's no use hiding!
I know you're up!
Just take Little Bob
and get rid of her!
Easy for you to say.
This is Irene.
Oh, my God!
Look, we can't
let her see this thing.
No offense.
The basement.
You'll love it.
It's like a cave
with a pool table.
Come on!
Nancy!
Nancy!
Beat it!
Come on, hurry!
Nancy! Yoo-hoo!
Quick, quick!
Let's go! Now's our chance!
Nancy, what...
SARAH: This is it!
The beginning of the end.
Once Irene sees it,
the whole world's gonna know.
I'll have to join a convent.
Nancy!
Marry a zoo-keeper.
I'll be a social outcast
for the rest of my life!
I'll go to my prom,
the kids will probably
throw pig blood on me!
Thank you, Dad.
Sarah, don't let her in!
ERNIE: Come on, big guy.
Rise and shine!
Don't worry.
It's the safest place
in the whole house!
Ernie!
It's okay, Mom,
the stairs broke!
We're all right.
Oh, good.
There you are!
Amazing. That was...
Can you imagine?
Little Bob must be in heat
or something. Every dog in
the neighborhood is out here.
My God!
What is that smell?
What the hell happened?
We decided
to defrost the fridge.
Oh, God!
Is everything all right
with you kids?
Us?
Oh, hey, fine.
Wonderful.
No. Great. Really great.
I got your mail.
Just put it
on the fridge.
Nan, you wouldn't happen
to have any peanut butter
and brewer's yeast?
I found a new diet.
Sarah, please take
the dog out of the room.
Peanut butter
I know we have.
Is chunky okay?
Let me see
if I can help you, Irene.
Peanut butter's always
on the second shelf.
Great. No brewer's yeast?
No, sorry.
Never mind,
I gotta go to the market
and pick up some
cod liver oil and Tabasco.
It's a new energy diet.
You might wanna try it,
George.
Exercise, Irene.
That's the only diet.
Plenty of energy
right here!
Well, maybe
it's just rotten meat
or eggs or something.
Exactly. No sense
standing around
breathing it.
Thank you for
taking care of Little Bob.
Oh! Ernie!
What was that?
Ernie's experiment
for his science class.
He's got
one of those gerbils.
Yeah! It's so cute.
Only, it's more like...
A hamster.
Yeah, only bigger,
and it's always hungry.
Nothing more than rats getting
a lucky shake from society,
if you ask me.
I know where you are
if I need you.
Ernie!
Ernie, are you all right?
Boy, is this guy strong!
Ernie, give me your arms.
I'll lift you up.
It's Monday morning.
What am I gonna do about work?
You are going
to call in sick,
that's what you're
going to do about work.
Dad's gonna just love that.
Can I be sick, too?
No.
I think you and Sarah
will be safer at school,
Ernie.
Oh, well.
At least I can tell
the kids at school
my dad creamed a Bigfoot.
You're sick, too.
We're all sick.
No one's going anywhere
until I figure out
what to do!
Get out of the fridge,
Ernie.
Coffee?
Now, it took
some doing, but...
At least for now
it seems to be trapped.
GEORGE: It's okay!
So, how are you doing?
I don't know.
He's our little pet.
It's hurt.
Are we sure
we don't have anything
that doesn't sting?
Don't I wish.
Yeah, this is going
to hurt a little, okay?
What I do is just
close my eyes real tight.
Like this.
NANCY: All right. Okay.
Good.
Does this mean
we can keep him?
Oh, grow up!
Maybe we can.
I don't know.
You don't know?
The answer is "No."
Now you know.
It was just so different
when it was dead.
George, you were different.
And I'm convinced
he wasn't dead.
Hey, hang on. I thought
we were gonna sell it,
and get rich.
Let's keep it
and get rich.
Exactly.
I don't believe
this family! Sorry.
We are talking about a living,
breathing being here.
It might even be
some kind of a person.
It's a Bigfoot person.
We don't even know
what it is.
We don't know
if it's male or female.
Definitely male.
How can you tell?
Oh, don't answer that, honey.
Never mind.
Nan, I don't know how,
but we gotta figure a way
to keep this thing.
It's big bucks,
don't you see?
I mean, it's a ticket
to a better life!
A better life for whom?
What about his life?
I'm thinking about us.
I just need time
to figure a way to...
Oh, well.
At least he's safe here.
LAFLEUR: You should not have
given up, my old friend.
The only difference
between these and those
is I get a buck
a strand for mine.
These are real, Doc.
I chased a set of tracks
for two or three miles.
Okay, Jocko,
if you've got castings,
I'll buy them,
but let's keep the price
on the ground.
Listen, you don't understand!
I almost had him.
I was that close.
Then what, gun jam?
Or maybe a change of heart.
Had him in your sights
and couldn't do it?
What's the story this time?
I don't know.
I think
he was hit by a car.
That should have
made it easy.
Yes, I know but...
There are no traces,
no tracks, nothing.
He just vanished.
Well, like I tell
my customers,
Bigfoot eat their dead.
I don't know
why the hell
I bother with you!
Because you figure
I'm the only one
who deep down
wants to believe you,
but I don't.
Not any more.
We both spent our whole lives
chasing after that beast,
and we both
have to stare at ourselves
in the mirror every morning
and keep repeating,
"I'm not a fool!"
"I am not a fool!"
Only you finally blinked!
Or finally
opened my eyes!
We'll find out soon enough!
Go for it, Jocko!
Raise a ruckus!
God knows,
I can use the business.
Put the stuff
in the freezer, honey.
Where is he?
Living room.
Everything is melting.
Have I got something
to show you.
George, give me a second.
Irene had us
cornered out there
for 15 minutes.
She invited us to dinner
and bowling.
Bowling?
Don't worry, George,
I spared you.
I told her you had something
to drop off tonight,
don't you?
Don't be so sure.
You might just change
your mind when you've
seen what I've seen.
Sarah, you, too.
Come on.
George, those are
just empty calories.
Never mind about that.
No, no, no, no.
Not yet.
Just a minute.
I have a little something
to show you.
But first,
I want you to think about this
just for a moment.
Us,
Life,
Time:
Magazines! Cover stories.
I mean, you could be looking
at old Dad on the Carson Show,
for heaven's sake.
No, no, no, no.
Now, we started
with something
kind of simple.
But I'm sure you'll see
that as soon as he gets going
there is absolutely nothing
to stop him!
Sit.
Sit.
Sit!
That's great!
You taught him how to sit?
No, no, no!
Don't sit!
That was outstanding, Dad!
No, no, no. Stay. Please...
George, if I could
have a word with you
before the Carson Show calls.
Nancy!
It wasn't...
Nancy, honey,
we've got to give him
one more chance!
George Nathan Henderson,
what is the matter with you?
This is our home! Our stuff!
Look, he had it perfect
just five minutes ago.
George, you are acting
like a crazy person!
Honey, that wasn't
supposed to happen!
None of this was
supposed to happen,
but it did,
and now we have
to do the right thing!
I know it seems bad,
but just give me
one more week.
We don't have enough house
for two days!
George, he doesn't fit here!
He doesn't fit in our lives!
Look, we have
to do the right thing
and think about him!
Mom, Dad, hurry,
this is great!
MAN ON TV:
What's the matter with him?
WOMAN: Maybe
he thinks you're getting...
Now watch this.
Cool, huh?
He didn't care
for the blue cheese.
... eat your Pablum
like a good boy...
... and you'll have
Swedish pancake too:
Now I know where
Bonzo get his bad habits:
That's outright bribery:
Okay.
I'll take him back.
But you know
it might not be so easy,
I think
he likes it here.
What kind of a way
is that to talk to a baby?
What do you mean?
She's gone.
It's time to go.
Remember this?
Your favorite station wagon.
Right. What's left of it.
No, no, no.
It's really much nicer
on the inside. Come on.
Perfect.
Hungry? We're gonna
have a little party.
Yeah. A goodbye party.
Plan B.
No problem.
See what we're gonna
be missing?
Never mind.
Let's eat. Nancy?
Here. Ern.
Have you
ever had a burger?
Smells good.
Look at this.
Mmm. Mmm.
Oh, right.
Yours was the fish. Here.
This is for him,
the burgers are for you.
You want another?
I ordered wrong.
Double fish
on a sesame bun.
Catch of the day.
Covered with tartar sauce.
How about
some fries, huh?
Extra larges,
two orders.
You can wash it down
with a chocolate shake.
Look at all this stuff!
All you can eat.
Atta boy.
Great!
Comfortable?
Just sit... Stay.
Stay.
Stay right there.
You're not changing
your mind, are you?
Your mom's right, Ern.
I know it's hard.
It's hard for me, too.
But it's the right thing
to do.
It was wrong of me
to think that we could just
claim it like a stray dog.
He's more of a man
than an animal.
You were the first one
to see that.
He deserves to be free.
Mom's right.
He's gotta go back
where he belongs.
So why don't you and me
go on down there,
like a couple of real men
and say,
"Goodbye, hairy friend."
Harry?
Since when does
he have a name?
Since right now.
Harry.
Harry!
There's someone in the house.
What should we do?
You stay right there.
TVANNOUNCER:
Good morning, Seattle:
Today Jerry's special...
You're free, Little Bob.
Go back to the wild.
Run, Little Bob.
Run free.
And now, your host,
the toast of
the Olympic Coast,
Jerry Seville!
SEVILLE: Thank you,
thank you, thank you:
Good morning, Seattle:
God, I hate this guy.
I'll turn it off.
No. Let me hate him.
It'll keep me awake
until the coffee kicks in.
But I sure am glad
it's Tuesday:
Isn't Monday
the dullest day of the week?
Up yours, Jerry.
Seems old Jer was wrong:
All right:
This morning's paper:
By no means front page news:
Are you sitting down?
Listen, late last night
a Hawthorne Hills man
discovered his wife
lying unconscious
on top of their car:
After the paramedics
had revived the woman
she said,
"She must have been put there
by a huge, hairy,
man-like creature
"resembling
the legendary Bigfoot...
Harry.
"... Who she had earlier
mistaken for a mouse!"
Hawthorne Hills?
A mouse?
A mouse!
I gotta find him.
I can't go to work.
When do we ever listen to
silly old Jerry Seville?
If there really was a Bigfoot,
don't you think I'd have had
him as a guest on my show?
I gotta check it out anyway.
No, the very best thing
that you can do
is go to work.
What if somebody finds him
before I...
All right?
See you tonight.
Bye-bye. Bye.
... John Morrow, who will
talk to us all about his new
squid and prune juice diet:
Bigfoot:
ERNIE: Mom, he came back!
Little Bob!
LAFLEUR:
It's amazing, you know,
I see an old Army buddy
from 40 years
driving along the freeway
and, of course,
I cannot remember his name
so I take his
license number plate
and I come here,
and because of that
I am going to find out where
he lives. It's fantastic.
Ten bucks.
So how about you,
George?
Did you see any Bigfoot?
What?
You know, your vacation.
Bigfoot?
No.
I read the things weigh
over 400 pounds.
Smell real bad, too.
Hell, looks like
we got one of those
right here.
What's your shoe size,
Billers?
Very funny.
I'm working with assholes.
Can I help you?
Probably yes.
I hope we can help each other.
I believe this is yours.
Okay, what are you
selling, buster, huh?
Mrs. Henderson?
Yes.
Irene, would you go see
if the tea kettle is
just about to boil, honey?
Thank you.
Good morning.
Hi.
I am called Richard Smith.
And I'm from
the U.S. Forestry Service
and I'm investigating
a possible road-kill,
with an animal
either killed or maimed
in a car accident.
Now, I know
that you did hit something
on Route A-4
which was a little fire road
off the l-90?
Yes. We did
run into something.
What was it that you hit,
Mrs. Henderson?
I don't know.
We couldn't see it.
You know,
it happened so fast.
Where is it now?
Now? I don't know.
It ran away.
Mrs. Henderson, obviously,
our main concern are
for your family,
to be sure no one was injured.
No one was injured.
I'm so pleased.
Obviously our other concern
is for the safety
of that poor little animal.
It could be out there
suffering
and I know you would want to
help me find it
so I could care for it.
No. I mean, yes.
But I mean,
there's nothing wrong with it.
It walked into the woods.
I mean, it didn't even limp.
Walked?
It crawled,
it scurried, you know,
it scampered,
it kind of wobbled, creeped,
like an animal does, you know?
Anyway, he's fine,
and we are fine and...
You know...
I forgot I have a sink
backed up and I...
And a potty.
I've gotta go take care of it.
Thank you.
Thanks very much
for thinking of us
and bringing this to us.
And thanks for
your consideration.
License plates, huh?
That guy's probably a convict.
Here.
What you don't need now
is somebody bothering you.
Just sit back and relax.
I can remember
Herb's and my first fight.
This is nothing.
Can I help you?
Probably not.
This is the first place
I have been.
I want some .458 magnums.
I think we got those
in here somewhere.
Yeah. Here we are.
We don't get much
call for these monsters.
$28.50 for the box.
Do you have any more?
There's 20 of them in there,
you know?
Do you have any more?
I'm sorry,
that's the last we got.
What, are you going
on safari or something?
No. Just into
my own back yard.
There he goes,
just like clockwork.
Jeez, Dad,
who the hell is that guy?
Jacques LaFleur.
He's always the first to show
when these crazy sightings
start up.
He bought some
pretty serious ammo, .458s.
Before Sasquatch
got under his skin
he was a Class A hunter.
Where do you think
Claws came from?
That guy shot Claws?
Yeah.
Why would he part
with a trophy like that?
Probably because
it was the smallest one.
May I help you?
Yes, I'm on my lunch break
and I'm kind of in a hurry.
Could you point me
to some books on the...
Bigfoot?
Sasquatch?
Sasquatch.
Sasquatch.
That's the one.
Fantasy, folklore,
myths and legends.
Basement stacks.
Take the stairs.
Thank you.
You could also try
children's books!
Right!
This book sucks!
Ernie.
These pictures
don't look anything
like Harry!
He's right, Nan.
It's no wonder
people wanna kill them.
These books make them
out to be monsters.
All except this journal
from the North American
Anthropological Institute.
Some guy named
Wallace Wrightwood.
NANCY: That's him.
No. That's Jacques LaFleur.
He's a hunter who came
into the store today.
No, honey.
This is Richard Smith,
the forestry guy
I told you about
who came
to our house today.
That lying bastard!
SARAH AND ERNIE: Mom!
Both of you, to bed,
right now.
Sarah, get off that phone.
It's two hours.
Come on, that's it!
Mom, it's only 8:30.
You mind your mother!
Hard to believe, huh?
And from the look in your mug,
you think it's a load,
don't you?
Everybody asks,
"Has anybody ever seen one?"
Let me ask you,
you being a flatlander,
a city fellow,
you've seen hundreds,
thousands of pigeons, right?
Of course.
Have you ever seen
a baby pigeon?
Well, neither have I.
But I got a hunch
they exist.
Are you Dr. Wrightwood?
I'm George Henderson.
Wrightwood ain't here.
Is he coming back?
He might.
Could I leave
a message for...
How do you know
Wrightwood?
His books. And his research.
He seems to be the only person
who really believes
in all this.
I just need a few answers.
Doctor's old, tired.
I'm gonna put
my phone number down here.
Could you see
that the Doctor gets this?
"Vital facts that could
prevent an unnecessary
and tragic end
"for the big fellow?"
I have a friend,
a man named Jack.
And say there was this,
this, giant...
Is there a beanstalk
involved in this,
Mr. Henderson?
A beanstalk?
No. No.
I mean, with all
these Bigfoot sightings
what if Jack
and his family
opened up their home
and their lives
to this thing?
And, what if they found out
that he was more human
than animal,
and they just said,
"We'll take him in.
"We'll accept responsibility
for him until a safe place
can be found for him to be."
Not some zoo, or lab...
So what you're saying is
you would be willing...
Excuse me,
Jack would be willing
to take this creature in,
care for it
and love it like a pet?
No, no,
like a member
of the family.
That's a noble gesture,
but impossible.
Sasquatch
is a primitive ancestor
of modern man,
but if you ever came
face to face with one
you'd see that they're still
very much animals.
Only on the outside.
Look, I know
what I'm talking about!
And I know it's closing time
so if you wanna talk shop,
then shop!
Jack and the Beanstalk,
George?
It just came out like that.
I didn't know
what I was saying.
I think you knew
exactly what you were saying.
Face it, Dad,
you want him back.
Sarah, I want to take him back
where he belongs,
but that means
I've gotta find him first.
By bringing Harry here
we put his life in danger.
Now, we've got to
try to set things right.
George,
this is really Harry.
Did you draw that?
Yeah.
NANCY: It's beautiful.
MAN: Hey! Hey, fella,
get away from that window!
WOMAN:
He's the person who saw it.
Now get this.
"It must have been the large
hairy giant he saw
running from the scene."
Did you get that, George?
Yeah.
George, do you still
fool with that painting stuff?
Yeah.
As a matter of fact, I...
Good!
You can save your old man
a few bucks.
How about you draw
a big full-size Bigfoot?
We'll put it in the window
right next to the gun section.
Now, you make him real big,
you know, real scary.
You know,
like they're supposed to be,
George.
Hands up, big claws,
big fangs, a lot of drool.
And let's put up
a map of the area,
and we'll mark on it
all the spots where people say
they've seen the thing.
We'll become kind of like
a Bigfoot Central, a B.H.Q.
Dad, don't you think
we might be encouraging
a lot of unqualified people
to go running around
with loaded weapons?
Come on, you know as well
as I do there's nothing
out there to shoot at.
This is the first time
my dad ever wanted me to draw
anything and what is it?
A target
for a bunch of blood-thirsty
crackpots.
Come to bed.
No, really,
it's the same old story.
One Christmas,
when I was a kid,
I begged him all fall
for a set of paints.
He ends up giving me a BB gun.
Like you got Ernie.
Yeah.
Come to bed.
No.
Honey, I can't.
I gotta finish this.
What's the problem?
If I make him look
mean and vicious,
people are gonna shoot first
and then worry
about the consequences.
It's like
drawing a "wanted" poster
of your best friend.
But if I make him look
peaceful, the way
Harry really is...
Well, that's just not
what my father wants.
George,
I'm so proud of you.
You don't know
what to do.
If your father
wants a Bigfoot,
give him a Bigfoot.
I wanted King Kong,
you brought me
a goddamn giant gerbil.
I told you exactly what to do.
You didn't even come close.
Well, maybe it's right
on the nose.
I mean, how do we know?
Maybe it's not vicious at all.
Maybe it's gentle,
even has feelings.
Where did you dream up
that shit?
Go stick a pin
in Queen Anne's Hill,
we just got another sighting.
Should have got a real artist.
MAN: I need one of those
Clint Eastwood magnums.
You got an M-16?
Anything that'll go
fully automatic?
Fully automatic is illegal
and it takes seven days
to clear a handgun.
I'm afraid if you want a gun
right now it'll have to be
a rifle or a shotgun.
Anything with a night-scope.
Give me the biggest one
you got!
Well, we've got some big guns
and some big, big guns,
but I'm afraid
we're all out of big,
big ammo! Who's next?
Look, pal, they just spotted
that thing not three blocks
from my house.
Where do you live?
What for?
It's for the gun.
Where do you live?
Where was the sighting?
On the corner
of Maple and Ogilvy.
What the hell's
that got to do with it?
Where you going?
MAN: Son of a bitch!
See? You're not
the only artist in the family.
How's that for
an arthritic old shooter, huh?
What the hell
did you do that for?
It was my drawing!
Why did you change it?
Hey, George. Cool down.
It's just
a piece of cardboard.
Not to me!
It means something to me!
Can't you see that?
He means something to me!
What the hell
are you talking about?
The hell with it! I quit!
Over this? You can't quit!
We've never been so busy!
What the hell's
the matter with you?
Harry.
Yeah.
Sorry, thought
you were someone else.
MAN: It was huge.
It was bigger than you are!
Twice as big as you.
Gigantic! Biggest thing
I ever saw.
Excuse me,
when did all this happen?
Do you mind? I'm trying
to take a statement.
It was huge. Gigantic.
A monster like an ape
with rabies, only bigger than
a regular ape with rabies.
Now just calm down
and tell me what happened.
Okay. I'm okay.
I brought my poor ten-speed
to a complete stop
like I always do
at stop signs.
When out of nowhere
this humungous hairy thing
is standing right
in front of me! Growling.
With these enormous fangs
and these giant hands,
and he grabs me.
And he picks me up,
bike and all, over his head
then he smashes me down
on the cement
and now he's all over me.
And he's snarling
with saliva dripping off
his pointed teeth.
So I grab my Mace...
What? Mace? You idiot!
COP: Stand back.
I didn't really Mace him.
I was about to be eaten!
Eaten? By a vegetarian?
All right, that's it.
Officers!
No, now look...
I have no doubt
that you saw him,
but what really happened is
when you saw him,
you were so scared shitless
that you crashed
your precious ten speed
into the stop sign,
bumped your head on the curb
and probably scared him
half to death in the process!
I'm right, aren't I?
That's what really happened,
isn't it?
Isn't it?
Yes. Yes.
How did you know this?
Did you witness it happen?
What's your name, sir?
My name?
My name is George Hen...
George, George what?
George Hen...
George what?
I'm sorry.
I really have to go.
MAN 1 ON TV:
... the dreaded name of Bigfoot
reverberated
through newsrooms...
MAN 2: They are usually
restricted to remote areas...
Today's report
of the legendary
beast attacking...
Other news, there has been
yet another sighting
of the creature
that some people are now
calling the legendary Bigfoot:
As a matter of fact
an eyewitness is now
claiming to have been attacked
by the legendary beast
known as Bigfoot:
He quickly changed
his story, however...
Update, Bigfoot right here
in the city:
When this mystery man
known to us as, George Hen,
appeared on the scene...
I have no doubt
that you saw him,
but when you saw him,
you were so scared...
... knowledge
of the Bigfoot's habits,
vanished before...
GEORGE ON TV:
... and bumped your head
on the curb...
... crashed your precious
ten-speed into the stop sign,
bumped your head on the curb
and probably scared him
half to death in the process!
WOMAN 2:
What's your name, sir?
My name?
My name is George Hen...
George, George what?
George Hen...
My name?
My name is George Hen...
George, George what?
George Hen...
WOMAN 2:
How did you know this?
MAN: Did you witness
it happen?
What's your name, sir?
My name?
My name is George Hen:
WOMAN 1: Listening to
our reporter talk about it,
you'd think Mr.: Hen
had a personal...
MAN 3: Did I catch the fact
that he actually...
Quite possible:
MAN 4: Anybody who knows
the whereabouts
of the elusive Mr.: Hen
or the hairy visitor,
should call this station
and report Bigfoot:
What the hell is that?
I said get out of here now!
Harry!
Harry!
I want this quadrant
air tight.
Nothing gets out! Nothing!
And no force
except in self-defense!
I don't want some prankster
in a monkey suit
bleeding all over
the streets.
WOMAN ON RADIO:
We have civilians
with weapons:
All units in the vicinity of
Broadway and Torrance
please respond:
Repeat, we have civilians
with weapons:
OFFICER: Hey, you! Halt!
Freeze! Move out!
Drop it!
What, are you crazy?
Do you know how much
I paid for this gun?
Get this guy. Come on,
move it! Move it!
My God! Harry?
Harry, are you hurt?
Where are you?
Harry.
Thank God, you're okay!
Come on down!
Stay right there!
Don't move.
Hang on, Harry.
Follow that garbage truck!
Harry! Harry,
come on down.
There. Quick! This way!
GEORGE: We did it!
GEORGE:  Nancy.
Honey.
Look who's here.
Harry?
Harry!
BOTH: Harry.
I knew it was you.
I could smell you
all the way upstairs.
Wow! Let's celebrate!
Let's take a picture!
I'll get the camera.
Ernie, no! No!
Harry,
I'm human.
I made a mistake
and I'm sorry.
Dad, he doesn't understand.
I know something
he'll understand.
Ernie, give me a hand.
George?
What are we gonna do
about Harry?
First things first.
Do you have a cat?
No!
Good, then
it's just a hairball.
Are you completely deaf?
I said,
"Get me out of here now.
"Tomorrow is too late!"
Jerome,
Jerome, I know where he is.
What the hell do you think
I have been doing
for the last 25 years?
Him!
Yes, Sasquatch!
Jerome, this time
it is different.
I've got his address.
Crazy?
You let me stay here
for one more hour
and I'll show you me crazy.
Time's running out.
Jerome,
you make something
happen... now.
Irene, the phone.
I've gotta get the phone.
Okay.
I just need someone
to talk to.
You know, it hasn't been easy
with this pool and everything!
And Herb? He's no help!
His latest theory is
that a condor flew over
and took a shit in it!
MAN: Hello?
Hello?
Hello.
I saw you on television
last night, Mr.: Hen,
and I think we should talk:
Who is this?
Do the words,
"Vital facts that could
prevent a tragic
"and unnecessary end
for the big fellow,"
ring a bell?
Nancy, it's Wrightwood.
Dr. Wrightwood?
Yes: How are you?
Fine.
Can we get together?
Sure, any time.
Now, this afternoon.
Well.
Come to the house.
How about dinner?
Hello, are you still there?
Sorry, bad connection.
You're up near Index, right?
Just take the l-5 right
into town. We're in
the Wallingford section.
George? What are you doing?
You?
I'm Wallace Wrightwood.
Dr. Wrightwood.
May I come in?
Yes, of course you can.
Nancy, this is Dr. Wrightwood.
He's the curator
of the Bigfoot Museum
I told you about.
I'm pleased to meet you.
Likewise. Thank you.
These are beautiful.
This is our daughter Sarah.
Hello.
GEORGE: Oh, and this is
our son, Ernest.
Hello.
ERNIE: Hello.
Ernie, this is
Dr. Wrightwood.
Something sure smells...
good.
That's dinner.
Roast beef.
Mom, where's the roast?
The roast.
I'll get it, hon.
The roast,
is resting in
a shallow unmarked grave
in the back yard.
Oh.
Right. Well,
there's plenty
of other stuff.
Are you vegetarians?
Sometimes.
It depends on the guest.
As you probably know, your Dad
paid me a visit the other day
at my museum.
I liked him.
What I'm gonna say now
just might save his life.
I don't understand.
When I was younger
I used to have a good job
working as a lab scientist.
Life was great.
And then something happened
on a hunting trip darn-near
that let the air
out of everything.
I went out for a walk
one day in the woods.
I heard a rustle behind me.
Then I smelled something
that made my eyes water
and my lungs smoke!
By the time I turned around
all I saw was a streak of fur.
On the ground
there was a footprint.
A big footprint.
So, I was hooked
from that moment on.
I started spending
all the time I could spare
searching for the beast.
Then I spent time
I couldn't spare.
That's how I lost my job
and my friends.
It's so sad.
Well, I didn't tell it
so you could cry
in your sprouts,
or whatever that is, darling.
I'm telling it so that
your father won't make
the same mistake.
I appreciate
what you're saying,
Dr. Wrightwood,
but there's a big difference
between your story and mine.
Not as big as you think.
Maybe even bigger.
No, no, no.
You're kidding yourself.
I remember what you told me
when you came into my shop.
Bigfoot can come live with us.
We'll accept
the responsibility.
Can you imagine
what a Bigfoot would do
to your home?
Yeah, well, I can.
You're good people.
I'm gonna say this once.
I'm gonna say it simple
and I hope to God
for your sakes you all listen.
There are no
abominable snowmen.
There are no Sasquatches.
There are no Bigfeet!
Am I missing something?
Oh, Lord! Lord God!
Dr. Wrightwood,
say hello to Harry.
Harry?
Isn't he something?
Oh, yes, he's so smart, too.
I mean, George has taught him
how to sit.
To sit?
We haven't quite
perfected it yet.
Hungry?
He lives here with you?
Temporarily.
Well?
If I call in a favor,
I might be able to get you
out sometime tonight.
Sometime tonight?
I need a damn good reason.
For Christ's sake,
I'm talking about bagging
a Sasquatch!
That'll cut a lot of ice
for the judge.
GEORGE: It's just not
Harry's world out there.
It's like
we've become an enemy
to anything wondrous.
Even the scientific
community's gonna
poke and prod at him
until he hates every man
that he sees,
including you and me.
The only answer is
a safe place where even
LaFleur can't find him.
I might know a place,
but we'd never be able
to find it in the dark.
Then you will
help us?
In every way
I possibly can.
That's wonderful.
We'll leave first thing
in the morning.
I'll wake the kids.
Real early.
They'll wanna come.
We'll make
a whole day of it.
Our last day with Harry.
He's so odd.
He didn't say good night.
I don't even know
when he's coming back.
Now, get some sleep.
And where the hell
have you been?
There was nothing I could do!
Don't bullshit!
They weren't letting
anybody out until they
processed those guns
and there were
a lot of guns!
You need a bath.
And what? Blow my cover?
Hey, come on!
Come on, give me my things!
Hey, when I'm ready, pal.
When he's ready, pal.
Jerome, do something, eh?
So what's your sign?
IRENE: Kimchee!
Kimchee! Kimchee!
My name is Kim Lee
not Kimchee!
You killed them!
Oh, no!
Where are my
precious little babies?
Thank you.
Forgive me, Harry?
I'm gonna
show these to Irene.
She loves roses.
Sure would be
a dream come true
if we could keep him.
Well, you know
what they say,
"The best things in life
are supposed to be free."
Hold it right there, mister.
What did you do to my roses?
No! Don't even
think about it!
One false move out of you
and I'm gonna
prune your plant.
And I'm talking
nip it in the bud!
My God!
ERNIE: Push.
Hurry up, Dad.
George, you drive.
It's not fair!
He should be mine!
Damn you!
LaFleur!
What?
I think we're being followed
by our own car!
Wow!
He stole my car!
GEORGE: Oh, my God,
will you look
at this traffic?
Damn!
Cops!
Everybody just act normal.
Here he comes!
Look what he's doing
to my paint job!
He's almost on us, Dad!
George, could you go
a little faster?
All right, Mom!
That sucker's history!
Don't kid yourself.
This is the part
he's good at.
ALL: Yay!
WRIGHTWOOD: I always miss it.
Hurry.
Up here, George.
Hurry!
You better make this
a short goodbye, George.
You've gotta go back
where you belong now.
Come on, now.
It's LaFleur!
Harry, you've gotta go!
LaFleur!
Hurry, please, please!
There's no time!
No, don't worry about us!
We'll be all right.
Get out of here!
Can't you see
we don't want you anymore?
Why can't you go back
where you came from?
Now, leave us alone!
Go.
Go!
Goodbye, my friend.
There's no need to cry.
We'll never see him again,
will we?
Sure we will!
We can just follow
his footprints.
Footprints.
Scatter.
Anything to throw him off!
It's a goddamn herd!
Oh, no!
Harry!
Good God! Harry, no!
Listen to me. You're wrong!
I was like you!
I almost killed him myself!
But it would have been murder!
He's not an animal!
He's our friend!
For God's sake, Jacques,
open your eyes!
Are you people
out of your minds?
Do you think
I'm going to stop now?
I'm going to kill him.
You're not gonna kill him!
You're not gonna hurt him!
I won't let you!
George!
George!
I'll kill you first!
Don't let him kill me!
Don't let him kill me!
Please, don't let him kill me!
Don't let him kill me!
Please, don't,
don't let him kill me.
I'm...
No, no...
Jacques LaFleur, meet Harry.
Harry Henderson.
Strange feeling, eh, Doc?
WRIGHTWOOD: What are you
talking about?
LAFLEUR: It's over.
Over?
Why, it's just
the beginning.
Jocko, this old ticker
hasn't thumped
like this for years.
It's like going
to heaven with your feet
still on the ground.
And we get to share it
with one of
our oldest friends.
Goodbye, Harry.
We gotta let him go.
GEORGE: Harry...
I never got a chance
to thank you.
I don't think you'll ever know
how much you've meant to us.
You take care of yourself
now, okay?
Okay.
Mon dieu!
They have a language?
Now, Jocko, what for you?
I don't know.
There's always Loch Ness.
