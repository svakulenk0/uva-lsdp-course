%% a legend is sung %%
%% of when England was young %%
%% and knights
were brave and bold %%
%% the good king had died %%
%% and no one could decide %%
%% who was rightful heir %%
%% to the throne %%
%% it seemed that the land %%
%% would be torn by war %%

%% in London town %%
%% the sword %%
%% in the Stone %%
and below the hilt
in letters of gold...
Were written these words:
"whoso pulleth out this sword
of this Stone and anvil...
Is rightwise king
born of England."
Though many tried for the sword
with all their strength,
None could move the sword
nor stir it.
So the Miracle had not worked,
And England was
still without a king,
And in time the marvelous sword
was forgotten.
This was a dark age,
Without law and without order.
men lived in fear
of one another,
For the strong
preyed upon the weak.
A dark age indeed.
Age of inconvenience.
No plumbing.
No electricity.
No nothing !
Oh, hang it all !
Hang it all !
Oh, now what ?  Now what ?
Leave !  Leave off !
Leave off !
Oh, you !  You--
You fiendish chain you !
Everything complicated.
One big medieval mess.
Ah, now, uh, let me see.
Um, he should be here in,
uh, I'd say half an hour.
Who ?  Who !
I'd like to know who.
I told you, Archimedes.
I am not sure.
All I know is that
someone will be coming,
someone very important.
pinfeathers !
Fate will direct him to me,
so that I, in turn,
May guide him to
his rightful place in the world.
and you say he will
arrive in half an hour ?
Ha !  Well, we'll just see.
And you will,
Archimedes, you will.
It's--  ow !
He'll be, uh, a boy.
Small boy, uh,
look at him go.
And where would you guess he is
at this very moment ?
I am not guessing, Archimedes.
I  where he is.
Uh, less than a mile from here
just beyond the Forest...
And right on schedule,
- Quiet, wart.
- I'm tryin' to be.
Nobody asked you to come along
in the first place.
- I'm not even movin'.
- Shut up !
Aha !  Here we go.
oh, what a setup.
Right smack through
the old gizzard.
Oh, oh !
Whoa !  Wh-- whoa !
why, you clumsy little fool !
Oh, kay, please.  I'm sorry.
I couldn't help it.  Please !
If I ever--
If I ever get
my hands on you, I'll wring
your scrawny little neck !
So help me I will !
I'll get the arrow, kay.
I'm sure I can find it.
oh.
Don't tell me
you're going in there ?
Why, it's swarming with wolves.
I'm not afraid.
Well, go ahead.
It's your skin, not mine.
Go on.  Go on.
There it is.
Oh, there it is.
Whoa !  What ?  Whoa !
Well, so, you did drop in
for tea after all.
Oh, you are a bit late,
you know.
Oh ?  I am ?
Now--
my name is Merlin.
Come, come.
Who are you, my lad ?
Oh, my name's Arthur,
but everyone calls me wart.
Oh.
Oh, what a perfect stuffed owl.
a stuffed--  well,
I beg your pardon !
He's alive, and he talks.
Yeah, and certainly
a great deal better than you do.
Oh, come, Archimedes.
Come, come now.
I want you to meet the wart.
Now, you must forgive him.
He's only a boy.
Boy ?  Boy ?
I see no boy.
Oh, I'm sorry that I--
That's all right.
he's much too sensitive.
Sensitive ?  Huh ?
Who ?  What ?  What ?
Oh !
how did you know that I would--
Oh, that you would be
dropping in ?
Well--
I happen to be a wizard,
A soothsayer,
a prognosticator.
I have the power
to see into the future.
I've even been there, lad,
and I've seen all these things.
They're only plans
and small models, of course.
Now, this, for instance
is a steam locomotive.
That won't be invented
for hundreds of years.
Oh !  You mean you can see
everything before it happens ?
Yes !  Everything !
Uh, uh, uh, uh !
Everything, Merlin ?
Uh, uh, no, no,
not everything.
I, uh, I admit I didn't know
whom to expect for tea.
But as you can see--
I figured the exact place !
You are very clever, sir.
Yes, well,
never mind the "sir."
Uh, just plain Merlin will do.
Now, would you care for sugar ?
Oh, yes, I would, please.
All right.  Sugar.
Guests first.
You know that.
When !
Have you had any schoolin' ?
Oh, yes !
I'm training to be a squire.
I'm learning the rules
of combat and swordsmanship...
And-- and jousting
and horsemanship.
Oh, yes, yes, very good.
That's--  that's--
uh, no, no, no !
English, Latin, French !
No !  When !  When !
Blast it all !  When !
Boy, now you can't--
You can't grow up without
a decent education, you know.
Oh, I suppose not,
sir-- Merlin.
So, I am going
to be your tutor.
But I've got to get
back to the castle.
They'll want me in the kitchen.
Oh, well, then very well.
We'll pack and be on our way.
Higitus, figitus,
zumba, ka, zing.
I want your attention,
every thing !
Hockety, pockety, wockety, wack,
abra, cabra, dabra, nack !
Shrink in size very small.
We've got to save
enough room for all !
Higitus, figitus, migitus, mum.
See here, sugar bowl.
You're getting rough.  That poor
old tea set is cracked enough.
Uh, let's start a-- uh--
oh.  Where was I, boy ?
Uh, hockety, pockety ?
Oh, yes, yes, that's right.
Hockety, pockety,
wockety, wack.
Be with you in just a minute,
son.  Packing's almost done.
You-- you--
you bungling blockhead !
Hey !  Easy there !
No, no, go ahead !
This is the best part now.
Higitus, figitus, migitus, mum !
Higitus, figitus, migitus, mum !
Prestidigitonium !
what a way to pack.
well-- well, now,
just a minute, boy.
How else would you get all
this stuff into one suitcase,
I'd like to know ?
Oh, but I think
it's wonderful.
Yes, it is rather.
Don't-- don't you get
any foolish ideas...
Because it won't !
But, sir, I don't have
any problems.
The world is
full of problems.
oh, blast it all !  There now.
You see what I mean ?
Everybody butting
their heads against
a brick wall.
Do you want to be all muscle
and no brain ?
I don't have any muscle.
You don't ?
How do you move about ?
I suppose I do
have a little.
Well, that's enough.
Now develop your brain.
Higher learning--
that's the thing.
So, first thing tomorrow morning
we'll start a full schedule.
Eight hours a day.
We'll have six hours
for schoolroom and two
for study period.
But I--
I don't have the time.
- I have page duties.
- Page duties ?  Ha !
We'll change all that.
There's got to be a shakeup.
Well, yes, sir,
I suppose so.
Y-y-yes, sir.
So, you must plan
for the future, boy.
You've got to find
a direction, and you've--
Uh, now by the by,
what direction is
this castle of yours ?
I think it's north,
the other way.
Oh, oh.
All right, then
we better get a move on.
Come on, lad.
Pick up the pace.
Pick it up.  Pick it up.
Yah, ho, the devil take it.
Oh, the devil take it.
Anyone's got better sense
than to go barging off
in that infernal Forest alone.
You had no business
letting him go.
Look, dad, I'm not
the wart's keeper.
well, blast it all  !  I am !
After all, I took him in,
adopted the lad, you might say.
Being his foster father,
well, I'm responsible.
Whoops.
Tiger !  Talbot !
Off with ya !
Now look here, wart.
What's the big idea of
gallivanting off in the woods...
And worrying the living
daylights out of everybody ?
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Sorry's not enough.
That's four demerits,
four hours extra kitchen duty.
Yes.  Report to the cook !
But, sir,
I'd like you to meet--
Go on.  Hop it, boy.
Hop, hop, hop it !
Yes, you've got to keep
a tight schedule to run
a big place like this.
Need strict rules,
especially for small boys.
And I most certainly agree.
Who are you--
uh, uh, oh, uh,
I mean, uh, you ?
My name is Merlin.
This is Archimedes,
You've got him
under a spell, Marvin.
You're a magician, hmm ?
The name is
I happen to be the world's
most powerful wizard.
come off it, man !
Gadzooks !
All right, I shall demonstrate.
Higitus, figitus, migitus, moe !
Wind and snow, swirl and blow !
what the devil are you up to ?
And that is what I call
a wizard blizzard.
Hey, kay.  Hey,
would you look at this ?
An indoor blizzard,
and in the month of July.
So what ?
all right, Marvin.
Turn her off.
I'm convinced.
Alakazam !
Uh, uh, oh, I, uh--
I hope you don't go in
for any of that black magic.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Never touch the stuff.
My magic is used mainly
for educational purposes.
In fact,
that is why I am here.
I have come
to educate the wart.
Oh, no, you don't.
I'm running this place.
If you think you're going
to fiddle with my schedule,
You'd better pack up your
bag of tricks and begone.
What ?  Well, by jove.
Hey, he's gone.
Hmm ?  Good riddance.
I'm gone, but then I'm not gone.
so, if I do leave,
You can never be sure
that I am gone, can you ?
Well, uh--
Well, I must say you...
Got me there, Marvin.
yes, well, you win.
You're welcome to stay,
if you like.
Thank you.
You're very kind,
very generous, I must say.
Well, all we can offer
is room and board.
Hard times,
you know, Marvin.
We'll put you up
in the northwest tower.
That's the guest room.
It's a bit drafty
in the winter.
But in this blazing hot weather,
it's the best room in the house.
Oh, yes, very lovely indeed.
So just make yourself
at home, Marvin.
Marvin ?
Marvin, Marvin, Marvin.
best room in the house.
guest room ?
Unwelcome guest room !
But if he thinks he can
get rid of me, I've got news
for that old walrus.
I'm sticking it out !
And I say we go back
to the woods.
Oh, not on your life.
That boy has got to have
an education.  He has a future.
Hmph.  Well, you may be right.
A skinny kid
like that would make
a crackin' good chimney sweep.
something tells me that
you're all wet, Archimedes.
Who goes there ?
It's pelinore !
Dash it all !
I've got big news
from London !  Big news !
Well, big news, eh ?  Huh.
Can't wait for
the London
First edition won't be out
for at least, uh, 1,200 years.
Archimedes, would you mind
sailing down there and--
Oh, come, come, come, come now.
You're as wet as you can get !
No !  No, no, no !
- I'll turn you into a human.
- Hmph !  You wouldn't dare.
I will !
So help me, I will !
All right !  All right !
All right !
All right.
Works every time.  Ha !
Just like magic.
Pelinore !
Big news.
Really big news.
Sit down, man,
and let's hear all about it.
They're having a big tournament
New Year's day.
Yeah, but, Ector--
Ector, here's where
all the excitement comes in.
To the winner of this tournament
goes the crown.
you-- you mean--
king of all England.
Kay, lad, did you hear that ?
Pretty fair prize,
I'd say.
Yes, and you could win it,
boy, if you'd knuckle down
to your training.
We'll have you knighted
by Christmas and off to London.
What do you say ?
Sure.  Why not ?
Why not ?
Wart, lad, how'd you
like to go to London ?
Oh, sir Ector, you mean it ?
If you stick to your duties,
you can be Kay’s squire.
Oh, I will, sir !
I will !
I don't want the wart
for my squire.
Here's to London,
and here's to kay !
cheers !
Weight forward !
Lean into it !
Steady, boy !
Steady !
Steady with the Lance.
Grip her tight !
Hit him clean !
No !  No, no !
heads up !
What ?
A-a-a-Archimedes ?
Archimedes, where--
where are we ?
In a tumbledown old tower
in the most miserable old castle
in all Christendom.
That's where.
C-castle ?  Castle ?
Don't you even
remember the boy ?
Uh, the boy ?
can't you remember
one blasted thing ?
Oh, now, just a moment.
I-I-I--
Tight grip on the Lance.
Oh !
Loose in the saddle.
Knees in tight.
Weight forward
and stay on target !
It's not a mere matter
of muscle, son.
Uh, jousting is,
uh, a fine skill.
science indeed.
One dummy trying
to knock off another dummy
with a bit of a stick.
And the wart's
just as hot for it
as the rest of them.
That's really worth something,
if it can only be turned
in the right direction.
Ha, ha.
Fat Chance of that.
Oh, I plan to cheat,
of course, use magic,
Every last trick in
the trade if I have to.
I'd give anything to go riding
about on a great white charger,
Slaying dragons and griffins
and man-eating giants.
Oh, no, you see,
I'm an orphan, and a knight
must be of proper birth.
I only hope I'm worthy
to be Kay’s squire.
That's a big job, too,
you know.
Oh, indeed, yes, yes.
I would say almost impossible.
Yes, well, now, lad,
When I said that
I could swim like a fish,
I really meant as a fish.
You mean you can turn
yourself into a fish ?
After all,
I happen to be a wizard.
Could you turn me
into a fish ?
Do you have any imagination ?
Can you imagine yourself
as a fish ?
Oh, that's easy.
I've done that lots of times.
Oh, well, good.
Then I think that
my magic can do the rest.
Uh--
Archimedes, what is
that fish formula ?
huh ?  Huh ?  Who ?  Who ?
What ?  What ?  What ?
Oh, uh, uh, Aquarius,
now if you don't mind,
I say good day to
the both of you, if you please.
When he stays out all night,
he's always grumpy
the next morning.
Then he must stay out
every night.
Yes, yes, yes, yes.  Oh.
Yes.  I say, that's
very good, boy, very--
Who ?  What, what ?
All right, boy.
All set.  Here we go.
Aquarius,
Merlin !  Am I a fish ?
Am I a fish ?
Yes.  Yes, yes, yes, yes,
you are a fish,
But if you don't stop that
flippity-floppin' around...
And get in the water,
you won't last long.
Now stay right here
in the tules, and I'll
be with you in a minute.
Wart !
So you thought you could take
right off like a shot, did you ?
Well, I am a fish,
aren't I ?
you merely look like a fish.
That doesn't mean
that you can swim like one.
You don't have the instinct.
So you'll have
to use your brain...
For a change.
You are living
between two planes now,
Somewhere between
the ceiling and the floor.
Now, there are lots
of ups and downs.
Like, uh--
like a helicopter.
- Helicopter ?
- Yes--  oh !
No, never mind.
Every flick of a fin
creates movement.
So first we'll start
with a caudal fin.
Now, that gives you
the forward thrust now.
Come on.  Let's get a rhythm.
Right, left !
Right, left.  One, two.
%% left and right
like day and night %%
%% in and out
thin and stout %%
%% for every up
there is a down %%
Yes !
%% for every high %%
There is a low ?
Uh-huh.
%% and for every to %%
there is a--
Fro.
Fro.
Yes, fro.
%% to and fro, stop and go %%
Merlin !  Merlin !
I swallowed a bug !
Oh.
What's wrong with that ?
After all, my boy,
you are a fish.
Yes--  oh !  Oh, I did.
Well, that's neither
here nor there.
The main thing is,
you must set your sights
upon the heights.
That's right.
%% don't just wait %%
%% it's meant to be %%
%% it's up to you
how far you go %%
%% if you don't try
you'll never know %%
%% and so, my lad
as I've explained %%
%% nothing ventured
nothing gained %%
Let's swim through
that tall grass again.
It tickles, doesn't it ?
Oh.
Oh, I beg your pardon.
me too.
%% for every to
there is a fro %%
%% for every stop
there is a go %%
%% and that's what makes
the world go round %%
Oh !  Let go !
Let go !  Let go !
Oh, you big,
bug-eyed bully you !
Who, me ?  Oh, here,
here, here, here now, boy.
No sense in going around
insulting bullfrogs.
A fish has plenty of
other problems without that.
The water world has its forests
and its jungles too.
So it has its tigers
and its wolves,
And that's what makes
the world go round.
You see, my boy,
it's nature's way.
%% upon the weak

%% and that is what

%% unless you use

Jehoshaphat !
Oh !
Quick, Merlin !  The magic !
No, no, you're on your own, lad.
Now's your Chance
to prove my point.
What point ?
That he's the brawn,
and you're the brain.
Oh, now don't panic !
U-use your head.
Outsmart the big brute.
Smart move, lad !
That's using the old intellect.
Bravo, boy !
Great strategy.
- Is the lesson about over ?
- Did you get the point ?
Yes, yes, brain over brawn.
Okay, lad,
I'll fix the big brute.
Higgledy, piggledy--
no, no, no, uh--  hocus-pocus--
what the blazes ?
Hey, diddle, da--
Merlin !
hmm ?
Now what ?  Oh.
Help, help !  Help !
Ouch !
hmm ?
Help !
Archimedes !
Archimedes !  Help !
What in thunder is a monster
like that doing in the moat ?
By George, I-I-I-- I'll-- I'll--
I'll turn him into a minnow.
Oh !  There you are, boy !
Snick, snack, snorum !
How in the world did you
ever get out of that mess ?
That big fish almost
swallowed me, and Archimedes--
He saved me !
Well, by jove.
Well, now, what do
you know about that ?
I did nothing of the sort.
I intended to eat him.
Young perch is my favorite dish.
You know that !
Oh !
Do you believe that, wart ?
Well, I--
wart !
Wart !
Thank you, Merlin.
It was so much fun.
And, Archimedes, I--
pinfeathers, boy !
Wart !
Where are you, boy ?
Comin' !  I'm comin' !
Now, Archimedes,
Why would you
half drown yourself
for a tidbit of fish, eh ?
And after
such a big breakfast.
Pinfeathers
and gully fluff !
We were doing fine
until we got in deep water.
Then along comes
this huge pike with big jaws
and sharp, jagged teeth.
Oh, turn him off, dad.
He was a monster !
The biggest fish I ever saw.
And, boy, that's the biggest
fish story I ever heard.
But it's true, sir.
That's three demerits
for being late and
three more for the fish story.
Now hop into the kitchen !
I told you the wart was looney !
He's either out of his head,
or there's something mighty
fishy going on around here.
%% for every high
there is a low %%
%% for every to
there is a fro %%
%% to and fro
stop and go %%
%% that's what makes
the world go round %%
Oh, it's you, Merlin, sir.
Uh, yes, my lad.
Now, have you
ever considered
being a squirrel ?
Oh, no, I don't suppose.
Uh, well, now--
There is a tiny creature
with enormous problems.
How he has survived
throughout the ages is one
of nature's big mysteries.
His life is hazardous,
downright dangerous.
- Uh, would you like to try it ?
- Oh, no, I better not.
Oh, oh.
That's too dangerous
for you, eh, hmm ?
Oh, no, it's not that.
It's just that
I've got six demerits,
all this work to do.
We'll have to modernize it.
Start an assembly line system.
All right now !  One and a-two
and a-three and a-four !
Skitun, de,
bitun, de, batun, de, dum.
But I'm supposed to do it.
No one will know
the difference, son.
Who cares as long as
the work gets done ?
A rubbity, scrubbity,
sweepity, flo.
Come on, son.
Let's go.  Let's go !
wart !  Wart !
Wart, now take it easy !
Take it easy, boy !
Wart, oh, no, boy !
No, no !
Wart !
Whoa !
Whoa !
Now, what did I tell you ?
Always look before you leap.
Well, I made it, didn't I ?
Yes, yes, you made it.
You made it, but you can't
always trust to luck, boy.
Now, first thing,
you start with the short jumps.
You gauge the distance
carefully and--
now, there, you see ?
Even then you can miss, so...
Don't take gravity too lightly
or it'll catch up with you.
What's gravity ?
Gravity is what
causes you to fall.
No, no, no.  It's the force
that pulls you downward.
The phenomenon that any two
material particles or bodies,
If free to move, will be
accelerated toward each other.
Uh, Merlin,
how will we get by ?
Hmm ?
Oh.  Oh, well, I suppose we
better go back to a sidetrack.
go on.  Go on !
You got lots of room.
well, I guess she
can't be sidetracked.
That's a girl squirrel, lad,
and a redhead at that.
She sure acts funny.
Well, she likes you.
Why ?  Oh !
Yes, well-- well,
that's nature again.
But I'm afraid there's
no time to explain.
Here, here.
You'd better leave me
out of it.
Yeah, me too.
Merlin !
Merlin !
You're on your own, lad.
I'm afraid magic can't
solve this problem.
look, I'm not a boy--
I mean, I'm not a squirrel.
I'm a boy.
a human boy, not a--
not a real squ--
Oh--
leave me alone !
Merlin, what'll I do ?
She won't leave me--  ow !
I'm afraid you're stuck, lad.
When a girl squirrel
chooses a mate, it's for life.
But I won't be
a squirrel tomorrow.
She doesn't know that.
She only knows one simple fact--
that you're a him,
and she's a her.
That's a natural phenomenon.
Phenomenum-num ?
Well, it's the, uh--
it's a state of being,
a frame of mind.
%% and to every being
of every kind %%
%% it is discombooberating %%
oh !
%% you're wasting time

%% you'll find

Now, look here.
I am not a boy--
I mean, I'm not a squirrel.
I'm a boy--
No, no, I mean--

I'm an old man.

Understand ?
Ooh !
Oh, hang it all.
Now go away.
Shoo, shoo !
Impossible.  Impossible.
Oh, confound it.
Confound it all !
Merlin, I'm tired
of being a squirrel.
It's nothing but trouble.
You've got trouble ?
Look at my--  look back there !
One side, lad.
Whoa !  Wait !  Whoa !
Help !  Merlin !  Help !
Oh, no !
Eek !
Aah !
By George--
Ohh !
Ohh !  Aah !
There !
You see ?  I'm an ugly,
horrible, grouchy old man !
Oooh !
Oh.
so, here we are.
Quick, Merlin,
the magic.
Snick, snack, snorum !
There, now you see ?
I'm not a squirrel.
I'm a boy.
I tried to tell you.
I'm a boy.
A human boy.
Oh, if you could
only understand.
Ohh !
Ah, you know, lad,
That love business
is a powerful thing.
ohh.
Greater than gravity ?
Well, yes, boy,
in its way.
Ohh !
%%
Ohh !
Ector !
Ector !
Sir Ector !
The kitchen !
Hold it, son !
Hold it !
Black magic
all over the place !
Kay !
Hold on, I say !
Aah !
Now, uh--
what's all the commotion, hmm ?
Oh, the kitchen !
It's under an evil spell !
Huh ?
It's bewitched !
Oh !  I bet it's
that old goat Marvin.
Come on, son.
I knew he'd give us trouble.
%%
Gadzooks !
Come on, kay !
To the attack !
ow !
Hold it !
- Ohh !
- Heaven preserve us !
kay !
Ohh !
Now, what have we here ?
Jumpin' hop toads !
Alakazam !
Oh, so there you are,
you old goat.
Well, what's the idea
of flinging your evil spells
all over the place, hmm ?
Lend me a hand, boy.
Well, what have you got
to say for yourself, hmm ?
You call washing dishes
and sweeping floors
a work of evil ?
I'll decide
what's right and wrong
around here !
besides, that's the wart's job.
One of his duties.
Look here, boy, if you want
to make that trip to London,
you'd better toe the Mark.
You old goat !
If I ever catch you
in my kitchen again, I'll--
Madam, you won't.
Oh, dear.
He's gone.
Well, by jove !
Oh, no.
No, no, no, kay, no.
He might cast an evil spell
on the lot of us,
turn us all to Stone.
Shh.  No, there's no telling
what the old devil might do.
He's not an old devil.
He-- he's good !
A-and his magic
is good too !
If-- if you'd just
leave him alone--
Now look here, wart.
That's three more demerits.
Box his ears, dad.
Just because you can't
understand something,
it doesn't mean it's wrong.
ten more demerits !
You make all the rules,
and nobody else
can say anything !
You've said aplenty, boy !
All that poppin' off
just cooked your goose.
Kay, from now on
young hobs is your squire.
Did you hear that, wart ?
Hobs is going to be
Kay’s squire.
-
- y-yes, sir.
That'll teach you to pop off,
you little pipsqueak.
Oh, I'm sorry,
lad.
Sorry
I spoiled everything.
I know that trip to London
means a great deal to you.
Oh, it's not your fault.
I shouldn't have
popped off.
Now I'm really done for.
No, no, you're in
a great spot, boy.
You can't go down now.
It can only be up from here.
I'd like to know how.
An education, lad.
What good will that do ?
Get it first.
Then who knows ?
Are you willing to try ?
well, what have I
got to lose ?
That's the spirit.
We'll start tomorrow.
We'll show 'em.
Won't we, boy ?
We sure will.
Now, first of all, lad,
We've got to get
all of these medieval ideas
out of your head.
Clear the way
for new ideas.
In the centuries ahead.
Now, that'll be
a great advantage, boy.
Advantage, indeed.
Hah !
If the boy goes about
saying the world is round,
they'll take him for a lunatic.
The world is round ?
And it also,
uh, goes around.
You mean
it'll be round someday.
It's round now.
Man will discover this
in centuries to come.
And he will also find
that the world is merely
a tiny speck in the universe.
Universe ?
Ehh, you're only
confusing the boy.
Before you're through,
he'll be so mixed up he'll be
wearing his shoes on his head.
After all, you can't
learn history in reverse.
I-it's confusing enough,
for Heaven's sake.
All right !
You're the headmaster now.
So from now on
he's your pupil.
So from now on, boy--
Yes, sir.
Now, to start off,
I want you to read these books.
That, my boy,
is a mountain
of knowledge.
- But I can't read.
- What, what ?  What ?
- And I don't suppose
you know how to write.
- N-no, sir.
- What do you know ?
- Well, I--
Never mind, never mind.
We'll start at the bottom--
the ABCs.
First the "a."
And now the "b."
Merlin, look !
I can write !
Oh, yes, yes.
That's very good, boy.
Hen scratch, that's all.
Hen scratch.  Now come on.
No, no, no, no, boy !
Use your head.  Use your head.
How do you ever expect
to learn anything ?
Uh, have you seen that,
uh, flying machine, uh, model ?
I have nothing to do with
your futuristic fiddle-faddle.
You know that.
What's that thing
up there ?
Hmm ?
Oh, oh, yes, of course.
Here we are.
You mean, men will fly
in one of those someday ?
If man were meant to fly,
he'd have been born with wings.
I am about to prove
otherwise, Archimedes,
If you care to watch.
Here she goes !
no, no, no, no !  Aah !
Ho-ho-ho !
Just like a rock.
It would have worked
if it weren't for
this infernal beard.
I never--
Man will fly someday,
I tell you.
I have been there.
I have seen it.
Oh, I do hope so.
I've always dreamed
about flying,
Avis, avitis, aviti, avetem,
presto digitonium.
It's my favorite dream.
Oh, but then I suppose
everybody dreams about flying.
I'm a bird !  I'm a bird !
I'm a bird !
Hold it, boy.
Not so fast.  Not so fast.
First, I'd better explain
the mechanics of a bird's wing.
Now, these large feathers...
Are called
the primaries, and--
And, uh, since when
do you know all about
birds' wings ?
I have made an extensive study
of birds in flight--
And if you don't mind,
I happen to be a bird.
All right, Mr. Know-it-all,
he's your pupil.
Ouch !
Now, boy,
Flying is not
merely some crude
mechanical process.
-
-
It is a delicate art.
Purely aesthetic.
Poetry of motion.
And the best way to learn it
is to do it.
Since we're pretty far up,
we'll start with a glide.
Spread your wings
way out-- way out.
Tippity-toe,
tippity-toe,
And off we go.
Now, tuck your feet under,
like me.
Whoa !  What ?  Whoa !
And don't fight
the air currents.
Use them.
Well, say !  Boy !
That's pretty good !
Well, boy,
you're a natural !
Are you sure this is
the first time that you've--
Wart !  Wart !
Hawk !  Hawk !
Look out, boy !
Heads up !  Wart !
Archimedes !
Help !
Wart !
Wart !
Sounds like
someone's sick.
How lovely.
I do hope it's serious.
Something dreadful.
Oh, bat gizzards.
It's nothing but
a scrawny little sparrow
with a beak full of soot.
Oh, I'm not really
a sparrow.
I'm a boy.
A boy ?
Merlin changed me
with his magic.
He's the world's
most powerful wizard.
Merlin ?
Ohh-ho, Merlin !
The world's
most powerful bungler.
Why, boy,
I've got more magic
in one little finger.
Now, don't tell me
you've never heard of
the marvelous madam Mim.
Well, no, I don't guess so.
Madam Mim ?
Good heavens,
good heavens !
Why, boy,
I'm the greatest.
I'm truly marvelous !
%% with only a touch %%
%% I have the power %%
%% zim zaba, rim bim %%
%% to wither a flower %%
Oh, that's terrible.
Thank you, my boy,
but that's nothing--
for me, no !
%% 'cause I'm the magnificent

You know what ?
I can even change size.
I can be huge !

Marvelous, boy, marvelous !
I'm marvelous !  Oh-ho-ho-ho !
Say, lad, did you know
I can make myself
uglier yet ?
Well, that would be
some trick--
Er, uh, I mean, uh--
Want to bet ?
Boo !
Aren't I hideous, boy ?
Perfectly revolting ?
Well, uh, yes, ma'am.
But you ain't
seen nothin' yet.
Watch this.

I'm an ugly old creep !
The magnificent, marvelous,
Mad, mad, mad, mad...
Madam Mim !
Who's the greatest ?
Well, um, Merlin's magic
is always, uh, well, useful,
Uh, for something good.
And he must see something
good in you.
Oh, I suppose so.
Yes, and in my book,
that's bad.
So, my boy,
I'm afraid
I'll have to destroy you.
D-destroy me ?
Yeah, I-I'll give you
a sporting Chance.
I'm mad about games,
you know.
Well, come on.
Get going, boy.
You gotta keep on your toes
in this game.
I win !  I win !
The game's over.
Ohh-ho-ho !
why, you little devil, you !
I'll wring
your scrawny little neck !
Mim !  Mim !
Wh-wh-what are you up to ?
Oh, uh, oh, m-Merlin.
Well, you're just in time.
We were playing a little game.
She was going to
destroy me.
And just what are you
gonna do about it ?
Want to fight ?
Want to have
a wizard's duel ?
as you wish, madam.
Well, come on.
Step outside.
After you, madam.
Wh-wh-what's up, boy ?
What's going on ?
They're having a wizard's duel.
What's that mean ?
Oh, it's a battle of wits.
The players change themselves
to different things...
In an attempt
to destroy one another.
D-d-de-destroy ?
Just watch.
You'll get the idea.
Now, first of all,
if you don't mind,
I'll make the rules.
Rules, indeed !
Why, she only wants rules
so she can break 'em !
- I'll take care of you later,
featherbrain.
-
Rule one:
No mineral or vegetable.
Only animal.
Rule two:
No make-believe things like,
oh, pink dragons and stuff.
Rule three:
No disappearing.
D-ohh !
- Rule four: No cheating.
- All right, all right.
Now pace off ten.
One, two, three, four--
Merlin, she disappeared !
Huh ?  M-Mim, now,
you made the rules !
Ouch !  Ow !  Ohh !
D-ohh !
change to something else,
Merlin !
Yes, yes, yes, yes.
Give me time to think.
Uh, higgedy-piggedy--
no, no, no.
Quick, Merlin !
Hurry !
Hoppity-hi--
Aha !  Oooh !
madam, just a minute !
Th-this is outr--
Come on !
Something bigger !
Something smaller !
M-m-Mim--
whew !
Ohh-ho-ho !
Yeow-ch !
Mim ?  Mim ?
A-are you--
wh-wh-what's going on here ?
You--
you big blimp !
Squash me, will ya ?
Uh-uh-uh-uh, Merlin.
Ouch !  Ohh !
Bravo !
Aah !
So you want to play rough,
do ya ?
well--
Well, all right,
Merlin !
I'll smash you good,
you old crab !
Aaah !
Here I come, Mim,
ready or not !
- Ba-a-a-a-aah !
- Merlin, you wouldn't dare !
Merlin--
n-now, Mim, n-no--
no dragons !
Remember ?
Did I say
no  dragons ?
Did I ?
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo !
Ohh-ho-ho !
I win, I win !
Oh, that horrible old witch !
I-I'll peck her eyes out !
No, no, boy.
He's gone.
Disappeared.
- What ?
- Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo !
watch it, boy !
Ah-choo !
Oh, it's not
too serious, madam.
You should recover in
a few weeks and be as good, uh--
I mean, as  as ever.
And lots and lots
of sunshine.
I hate sunshine !
You were really great,
Merlin.
But you could've
been killed.
It was worth it, lad,
if you learned
something from it.
Knowledge and wisdom
is the real power.
Right you are, wart.
So stick to
your schooling, boy.
O-oh, don't worry.
I will, sir, I will.
Oh, I really will.
Here's to victory
in London...
For my son kay.
Sir kay.
I've been knighted,
don't forget.
Oh, of course, son.
Of course.
And who knows ?
The future king
of all England !
Watch it, will ya !
Kay, the king ?
What a dreadful thought.
Sir Ector !
Sir Ector !
Hobs has come down
with the mumps !
Then Kay'll need
another squire.
Hang it all.
- Wart, you're it.
- I'm what, sir ?
Kay's squire.
You're going to London, boy.
Oh, sir Ector--
whoa !  What ?
Whoa !
Merlin !  Archimedes !
Merlin !
Merlin, look !
I'm a squire !
Ha !
Oh, uh, very nice, boy.
Yes, indeed.
A fine monkey suit
for polishing boots.
It's-- it's what
all squires wear.
And I thought you were going
to amount to something.
I thought you had
a few brains !
Ha !
A stooge
for that big lunk Kay.
Congratulations, boy !
What do you want me
to be ?
I'm nobody.
Y-you don't know a thing
about what's going on today.
I-I'm lucky
to be Kay’s squire.
Oh !
Of all the idiotic--
I-I-I--
Blow me to Bermuda !
Where did he go ?
To Bermuda,
I suppose.
Where's that ?
Oh, an island way off somewhere
that hasn't been discovered yet.
Will he ever come back ?
Who knows ?
Who knows anything ?
%%
Let the tournament begin !
you see, kay ?
Now it's up to
the swords.
Swords ?  Swords ?
Oh, no !
- Kay ?
- What ?  What ?
I, uh--
I-I-I forgot your sword.
Forgot my sword ?
I-- I left it
back at the inn.
Why, you bungling
little fool !
You'd better get it !
Or don't you dare
come back !
Let me in !  Let me in !
Somebody, please !
Please let me in !
It's no use, boy.
They've all gone
to the tournament.
Oh, what'll I do ?
Kay's got to have a sword.
Look, boy, look !
There,
in the churchyard !
A sword !
Oh, Archimedes,
a sword !
But Kay’s
got to have a sword !
Now come on, quick !
Let's get out of here !
You're up next, son.
Better get ready.
This is not my sword.
Hold on, kay !
Wait a minute !
"whoso pulleth out
this sword--"
it's the sword in the Stone !
The sword in the Stone ?
It can't be !
But look !
It is !
It's the marvelous sword !
Hold everything !
%%
someone's pulled the sword
from the Stone !
Where did you
get it, wart ?
I-I pulled it out of an anvil
that was on a Stone
I-in a churchyard.
Very funny !
The lad's
a young Samson !
You're making a fool of us.
Tell the truth !
But I did, sir.
Then come on.  Prove it.
Back to the Stone with you !
yes, prove it !
Come on.  Prove it !
All right, boy,
let's have the Miracle.
Now, wait a minute !
Anyone can pull it
once it's been pulled.
-
- go to it, kay.
Give it all you got !
Put your back into it !
Push him !  I say !
One side !
- Hold on !  That's not fair !
- I say we let the boy try it.
That's what I say.
Give the boy a Chance.
Go ahead, son.
It's a Miracle,
Ordained
by Heaven.
This boy
is our king.
Well, by jove.
Uh, wart--
oh, uh, I mean, Arthur.
Hail king Arthur !
Long live the king !
I can't believe it !
oh, forgive me, son.
Forgive me.
Oh, please don't,
sir.
Kay !
so, at last the Miracle
had come to pass...
In that far-off time
upon New Year's day,
And the glorious reign
of king Arthur was begun.
I can't be a king, Archimedes.
I don't know anything
about ruling a country.
I told you
to leave the thing
in the Stone, boy.
I'll run away.
That's what I'll do.
they'll just have to
get somebody else.
Better take
the side door, wart.
Out the side door.
hail king Arthur !
Long live the king !
There's another door.
Over there !  Over there !
Come on !  Come on !
Looks like
we're surrounded, boy.
Oh, Archimedes,
I-I wish Merlin was here.
Merlin !
Merlin !
Merlin, you're back
from ber-- ber-- ber--
Bermuda ?
Yes, back from Bermuda
and the 20th century.
And believe me,
you can have it.
One big modern mess.
- Alakazam !
- I'm in an awful pickle.
I'm king !
He pulled a sword
from the Stone.
Ha, ha !
Of course.
Of course !
King Arthur
and his knights
of the round table.
Round table ?
Oh, uh, would you rather
have a square one ?
Oh, no.
Round'll be fine.
boy, boy, boy.
They'll be writing
books about you
for centuries to come.
Motion picture ?
Oh.
Uh, well, um,
that's something
like television.
without commercials.
%% hail king Arthur
long live the king %%
