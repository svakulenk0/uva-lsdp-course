Here in Malaysia, there is an almost
overwhelming sense of euphoria...
as the newly-elected prime minister
has given this nation hope...
promising to raise
the substandard minimum wage...
and end child labor
once and for all...
Already considered a living saint...
he has become this small country's
greatest hope...
for a thriving future
in the new millennium...
for a thriving future
in the new millennium...
Get closer, Jaco.
This is disgusting.
How could you let this happen?
I have negotiated
my butt off, Giorgio.
I've tried bribes, I've tried gifts.
I even sent him some pet oxen.
I mean, they love that crap
in Malaysia.
But he won't budge.
Listen, 50 percent of my inventory
is manufactured...
in sweatshops
on the Malaysian border.
Something has got to be done.
If Malaysia goes, what is next?
My entire panty line
is made in Vietnam.
We'll all go bankrupt
within a year.
The Malaysian must be
eliminated, Mugatu.
What? No, I don't
have time for this.
Perhaps you'd rather go back
to turning out novelty neckties.
But my new fall line is almost due.
And I trust you would like to live
to see your spring line as well?
The Malaysian prime minister
visits New York in 14 days.
Do it then.
Fourteen days? That's Fashion Week.
It's impossible! I have a show!
It's perfect. Invite him
to be your guest of honor.
That's not enough time.
It takes months to train an operative.
What about Fabio?
Too smart.
This is a rush job.
He's got to be extremely
dim-witted.
- You know the profile,Jacobim.
- A beautiful, self-absorbed...
simpleton who can be manipulated
and molded like Jell-O.
Or cookie dough.
- Or Play-Doh.
- Any kind of dough.
The point is,
we need an empty vessel...
a shallow, dumb, vacuous moron.
And when he's finished,
we'll dispose of him.
But who?
I mean, where in all of God's
green goodness...
am I gonna find someone
that beef-headed?
am I gonna find someone
that beef-headed?
Derek, I just have a few more
questions, if that's okay.
Cool.
So when did you know
you wanted to be a model?
It would have to be the first time
I went through the second grade.
I caught my reflection in a spoon
while I was eating my cereal...
and I remember thinking,
"Wow, you're ridiculously good-looking.
Maybe you could do that
for a career"
Do what?
- Be professionally good-looking.
- Right.
What would you say your
trademark is, if you have one?
Well, I guess the look
I'm best known for is Blue Steel.
What's that look like?
That's impressive.
And then there's Ferrari
and Le Tigre.
Le Tigre's a lot softer.
It's a bit more of a catalog look.
- I use it for footwear sometimes.
- Can I see that?
Look, without Derek Zoolander, male
modeling wouldn't be what it is.
He is a fashion icon.
So, do you spend a lot of time
working on these looks...
thinking about them?
Sure. I've been working on Magnum
for at least eight or nine years.
Magnum? That's intriguing.
Can I see that?
Are you kidding? I shouldn't
even be talking about it.
It's nowhere near ready.
It's almost like
there's a light around him...
He exudes beauty.
I think about Derek
every time I design a collection.
You may be familiar with the belief
that some aboriginal tribes hold.
It's the concept that a photo
might steal a part of your soul.
What are your thoughts on that...
as someone who gets his picture
taken for a living?
That Blue Steel look he does...
Oh, my Gosh, the style and the hair...
It's almost like the new afro for
the white man, but it's beautiful.
Well, I guess I would have to answer
your question with another question.
How many "abo-digitals"
do you see modeling?
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the
fashion industry's biggest night...
the VH1 Fashion Awards...
the VH1 Fashion Awards...
There he is, three-time
Male Model ofthe Year...
Derek Zoolander...
He's like music.
Proud owner of Blue Steel, the look
that made him the legend he now is...
He's almost too good-looking.
Hey, Paco!
That would be my main deterrent
in considering a relationship.
And that's who Derek Zoolander is
defending his title against tonight...
Hansel...
- Hansel, right here!
- All right, all right.
The rookie sensation
who has burned his way...
into the eye sockets
ofthe fashion world...
and left them clawing
their faces for more...
Mugatu sucks!
Support the prime minister!
Mugatu uses slave labor!
Down with Mugatu!
You hate to see something like that
at an event like this...
Ugly protesters
bothering beautiful people.
There's no denying Jacobim Mugatu
has used cheap Malaysian workers...
to make his and most
of the garment industry's clothes...
Hey, Steve, how are you doing?
You're going for your fourth
Male Model of the Year award.
- Are you nervous?
- I have butterflies in my basket...
but I think I'm doing okay.
We also hear you're working on a new
look. Can you tell us about it?
Actually, I can't, Steve,
because it's not yet perfected.
But I can tell you
that it's called Magnum and...
Shut, baby, shut!
If I tell you anything else,
this guy's gonna kill me.
Got that right.
How are you doing, Steven?
- Maury Ballstein, Balls Models.
- A man who needs no introduction.
Maury, you've handle every important
male model for the last 30 years.
- Derek's chances tonight?
- Let me tell you something.
Nobody can touch Derek.
Nobody! I gotta get inside.
I'm "shvitzing" like a "shmedrik"
with all these lights.
Are you worried about Hansel?
Not as much
as I'm worried about Gretel.
Hey, put that Hansel and Gretel
line in your article.
I want people to know
how funny I can be.
Oh, believe me, they'll know.
It hits newsstands tomorrow.
Excuse me, Mr. Mugatu.
Mr. Mugatu, Matilda Jeffries.
Time magazine.
Any comment on Prime Minister
Hassan's wage increases...
for Malaysian garment workers?
- No, he has no comment.
Let him speak for himself. Would you
like to see the prime minister...
out of power so you can continue
exploiting cheap Malaysian workers?
Hey, Mugatu! Screw you
and your little dog too!
Look out!
She's got an egg!
Oh, my God! Let go of me!
Yes!
Wow.
I just can't tell you how much
this means to me...
to be the first recipient
of this beautiful award.
We have a serious problem
on our hands, Maury.
This Malaysian thing
is getting out of hand.
I hear you,Jaco.
What this, the Slashie, mean...
is you consider me
the best actor slash model...
and not the otherway around.
His proposed wage increase
could ruin all of us.
I need it taken care of soon.
I have people to answer to.
Now to the important stuff.
These ain't no slashes, folks...
These are the pure breeds...
Here are the nominees
for Male Model of the Year...
Young, hot, brash...
With more covers in his first year
than any rookie model ever...
and an attitude that says,
"Wiho cares? It's only fashion..."
That Hansel's so hot ri ght now.
I hear a lot of words
like "beauty"and "handsomeness"...
and "incredibly chiseled features..."
To me, that's like a vanity,
a self-absorption...
that I try to steer clear of...
I dig the bungee... For me,
it'sjust the way I live my life...
I grip it and I rip it...
I live it with a lot offlair...
I live it on the edge,
where I gotta be...
I wasn 't like every other kid,
who dreams about being an astronaut...
I was always more interested in what
bark was made out of on a tree...
Richard Gere's
a real hero of mine... Sting...
Sting would be another person
who 's a hero...
The music that he's created...
I don 't really listen to it...
But the fact that he's making it,
I respect that...
I care desperately about what I do...
Do I know what
product I'm selling? No...
Do I know what I'm doing today? No...
But I'm here,
and I'm gonna give it my best shot...
Over the past decade...
male modeling has had a shadow
cast over it by one man...
and five syllables...
Der-ek Zoo-lan-der...
Modeling, to me, isn 't just
about being good-looking...
or having a lot of fun and
being really, really good-looking...
The calender was great...
because it gave people a chance
to see a side of my versatility...
The original Greek word for model
means "misshapen ball of clay..."
and I try to think about that every
time I get in front of a camera...
Three-time Male Model ofthe Year...
And the award goes to...
Hansel.
Thank you, Lenny.
Wow!
You know, a lot of people said
winning this award...
four years in a row
couldn't happen.
Well, I guess I showed...
I think we've found
our solution, Ballstein.
No, not Derek.
He's perfect, and you know it.
Now make it happen.
I stings me like a fissure
in my ass, but you're right.
He's ready.
Who am I?
I don't know.
I guess I have
a lot of things to ponder.
Hey, the results are in, amigo!
What's left to ponder?
Nice comeback!
I can't stand Hansel!
I know, right? Riding in
on that scooter like he's so cool.
- And the way Hansel combs his hair.
- Or, like, doesn't.
It's like, "ex-squeeze" me, but
have you ever heard of styling gel?
I'm sure Hansel's heard
of styling gel. He's a male model.
Earth to Brint.
I was making a joke.
Earth to Meekus.
Duh, okay? I knew that.
Earth to Brint.
I'm not so sure you did...
'cause you were all,
"I'm sure he's heard of styling gel"...
like you didn't know it was a joke.
I knew it was a joke, Meekus.
I just didn't get it right away.
- Earth to Brint...
- Would you guys stop it already!
Did you ever think that maybe
there's more to life...
than being really, really,
ridiculously good-looking?
Maybe we should be doing something
more meaningful with our lives.
Like helping people.
Uh, Derek, what people?
I don't know.
People who need help.
Models help people. They make them
feel good about themselves.
They also show them
how to dress cool...
and wear their hair
in interesting ways.
I guess so.
You know what could really help you
sort through these important issues?
What?
Orange mocha frappuccino!
Yeah!
Come on, man! Come on!
"Derek Zoolander: a model, idiot"
- Brint!
- Huh?
Rufus, Brint and Meekus
were like brothers to me.
And when I say brother, I don't
mean like an actual brother...
but I mean it like the way
black people use it...
which is more meaningful, I think.
If there's anything that this
horrible tragedy can teach us...
it's that a male model's life
is a precious, precious commodity.
Just because we have chiseled abs...
and stunning features...
it doesn't mean that we can't die
in a freak gasoline fight accident.
So today, ladies and gentlemen,
I'd like to take this opportunity...
to announce my retire...
Hansel.
He's so hot right now.
I would like to take this oppor...
People!
I'd like to announce my retirement
from the male modeling profession.
What?
I'm pretty sure there's a lot more
to life than being good-looking.
And I plan on finding out
what that is. Thank you.
Mr. Mugatu! Mr. Mugatu!
If I could just have
a moment of your time, please, sir.
Just one minute of your time,
please, sir!
- What do you want?
- I'm trying to talk to Mugatu...
but he's tougher to get to
than the president.
Oh, I thought you were gonna tell me
what a bad "eugoogolizer" I am.
A what?
A "eugoogolizer"'
One who speaks at funerals.
Or did you think I'd be too stupid
to know what a "eugoogoly" was?
How could you have written
those terrible things about me?
Derek, my editor
put that headline on it, okay?
I'm sorry. I know
it came off kind of harsh.
Yeah, well, fortunately foryou,
not too many people I know...
read your little Time magazine,
or whatever it's called.
Look, maybe you could do me a favor.
All I'm trying to do is get some
background information on Mugatu.
Mugatu? If you knew anything...
you know Mugatu's the one designer
who's never hired me.
Come on. There's gotta be...
Sorry, lady. Not interested.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got
an after funeral party to attend.
Go back home?
You're overreacting...
I want to do something meaningful
with my life, Maury...
I have deeper thoughts on my mind.
The other day, I was thinking
about volunteering...
to help teach underprivileged
children to learn how to read.
Just thinking about it was the most
rewarding experience I've ever had.
Derek, I don't think you're cut out
for that kind of thing.
I mean, maybe I could even have
my own institute.
We could call it the Derek Zoolander
Center for Kids Who Can't Read Good.
What about us?
We built this place together.
Look out! Tushy squeeze!
When I met you,
you were a junior petite...
who couldn't book
a goddamn Sears catalog...
and who couldn't turn left
to save his ass.
- Now look at you.
- I can turn left!
Yeah, right.
Please. Some male models go left
at the end of a runway...
others go right.
You got a lot of gifts, but hanging
a louie just isn't one of them.
Sit down!
Hey, you want to hear
some great news?
Mugatu wants you
for his new campaign.
Didn't you hear me, Maury?
I just retired.
But this is Mugatu, Derek.
Right now, this guy is so hot...
he can take a crap,
wrap it in tin foil...
put a couple of fishhooks on it...
and sell it to Queen Elizabeth
as earrings.
Derek, you're the laughing stock
of the entire fashion world.
What do we do
when we fall off the horse?
We get back on.
Sorry, Maury.
I'm not a gymnast.
I'm going back home. I need
to get in touch with my roots.
Figure out who I am.
See you around, Maury.
Hey, Pop!
It's me.
Scrappy, Luke...
you rememberyour brother, right?
What do you want?
I thought maybe I could work
the mines with you guys.
All the Zoolander men together
again, like when we were kids.
Times have changed. You wouldn't
last one day down those coal pits.
Can't you even pretend
to be happy to see me, Pop?
Damn it, Derek, I'm a coal miner,
not a professional television actor.
Do us all a favor
and get out of here.
Pop, wait, please!
Give me a chance.
I won't let you down.
I promise.
Hold very still. Very still.
I'm working right now. This...
- Ouch!
- Oh, I'm sorry.
Did my pin get in the way
of your ass?
Do me a favor and lose
five pounds immediately...
or get out of my building like now!
Get out!
I'm so tired!
No, Todd, not now!
It's Maury.
Tell me something good.
You may have to start
looking for someone else.
There is no one else.
The show is in ten days, Ballstein.
Jaco, I hearyou,
but the kid's mixed up.
He went home... He's talking
about going offto ponder...
and tutoring underprivileged
retards or some shit.
I don't care what it takes.
Get him back..
We're running out of time.
Capisce?
Yeah, I capisce...
Now if I could only "ca-piss"'
My prostate's flaring up
like a frickin' tiki torch.
Give me a little pee-pee.
Come on, a couple of drops.
That's what I'm talking about!
That's what I'm talking about!
Surprise!
What the hell's
the matter with you?
Pacheco back to pass...
He's feeling pressure from Pressman...
He's looking for his all-American
John De Rosa, the wide receiver...
He's got him wide open
in the middle ofthe field...
Big rush...
Who's winning the match?
Hits Kevin Conley,
the tight end down in there...
State.
I think I'm getting
the black lung, Pop.
It's not very well ventilated
down there.
For Christ's sake, Derek,
you've been down there one day.
Talk to me in 30 years.
Moisture is the essence
ofwetness...
and wetness is the essence
ofbeauty...
Why'd you have to come back
to this damn town?
I wanted to make
a new life for myself.
I'm sorry I was born
with this perfect bone structure.
That my hair looks better
done up with gel and mousse...
than hidden under a stupid hat
with a light on it!
All I ever wanted to do
was make you proud of me, Pop.
With what? Your male modeling?
Prancing around in your underwear
with your wiener hanging out?
You're dead to me, boy.
You're more dead to me
than your dead mother.
I just thank the Lord she didn't
live to see her son as a mermaid.
Mer-man.
Who am I?
Hello? Derek,you hearing me?
- God?
- God?
Wihat the shit are you talking about?
It's me... Maury...
I hope you're finished
touching your roots...
because Mugatu's making you
an offer you won 't believe...
You gotta get your took us back here...
Well, to tell you the truth,
I was a little hesitant at first.
I mean, you've never hired me
before, and I've been around...
For ages and ages.
You've been around for a long time.
I never wanted anything from you.
And now that you're retired,
I can't have you.
And it's funny
how it switches like that.
But now the forbidden fruit
must be tasted.
Well, when Maury told me
what you were willing to do, I...
Are you not aware that I get farty
and bloated with a foamy latte?
My mistake,Jacobim.
Your mistake indeed!
Yes, Derek.
What Maury said
I was willing to do foryou.
Let's get back to the reason
that we're really here.
Without much further ado,
I give you...
the Derek Zoolander Center
for Kids Who Can't Read Good.
What is this?
A center for ants?
What?
How can we be expected to teach
children to learn how to read...
if they can't even fit
inside the building?
- Derek, it's just a small...
- I don't want to hearyour excuses!
The center has to be at least...
three times bigger than this.
- He's absolutely right.
- Thank you.
I have a vision.
And so do I.
Let me show you mine.
I can't help you, lady...
I don't know nothing about Mugatu...
But you've represented every
male model in each of his campaigns.
You must have some kind
of a relationship with him.
Even if I did,
why would I talk to you?
Shame on you how you picked on
Derek Zoolander in that story.
He's a sweet simpleton
who never hurt a fly.
Please don't change the subject,
Mr. Ballstein.
What about Mugatu's exploitation
of sweatshop workers in Malaysia?
- Do you have an opinion on that?
- You wanna hear an opinion?
With a push-up bra, you could have
a nice rack of lamb going on there.
Let me show you
the future of fashion.
Let me show you...
Derelicte!
It is a fashion, a way of life...
inspired by the very homeless,
the vagrants...
the crack whores that make
this wonderful city so unique.
And I want you, Derek,
to be the face...
the image... nay,
the spirit of Derelicte!
It'll be your glorious comeback.
Sounds cool.
Derek, I'd like you to meet
Katinka Ingabogovinana.
She'll be your day-to-day
on the campaign.
Let's get this model on his way!
The big show
is in eight days, Derek...
Like a caterpillar
becomes a butterfly...
so must you become Derelicte!
So you want me
to sleep in the gutter?
No... Wie're sending you
to a very exclusive day spa...
So exclusive,
no one knows about it...
Our little secret, okay?
- Mati lda, hey.
- Hey, Arch, what's up?
Nothing. I've just
been up for a few days...
putting together these background
articles on Mugatu you asked for.
Very thorough, Archie.
Thank you.
It's weird. I couldn't get
any info on him before 1995.
It's like he just appeared
out of the blue.
- Really? That's strange.
- Yeah.
- Matilda Jeffries.
- Keep pulling the sweater.
- Excuse me?
- Eventually the thing will unravel...
You mean, if you pull the thread,
the whole thing will unravel?
Now you're talking, sister. If you
want to know more, go to Pier 12.
Things aren't what they seem.
What kind of spa is this?
It's designed
for deep, deep relaxation.
Come, let's get you loosened up.
Good boy.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Matilda, what are you doing here?
I was...
What are you doing here, Derek?
I thought you quit the business.
Haven't you heard? I'm the new face
of Mugatu's Derelicte campaign.
What do you mean, Derek?
You said Mugatu never hires you.
Well, I guess he changed his mind.
It's the world's biggest campaign.
What is this? Who are you?
This is private property. Nils!
I suggest you and your Kmart
Jaclyn Smith Collection outfit...
stay the hell away
from Derek Zoolander.
How do you feel, Derek?
When's the seaweed wrap?
You shut up now.
I want you to relax...
and breathe deeply.
Breathe deeply.
- I like this song.
- Of course you do.
Wielcome to your relaxation time...
Let this wonderful
'80s classic soothe you...
Just a nice, warm, happy time...
Happy, happy...
Nothing to worry about at all...
Just relax...
Hey there, Derek...
My name is Lil' Kleatus...
I'm just a kid who wants you to know
the truth about child labor laws...
They're silly and outdated...
In the good old days...
kids as young as five
could work as they pleased...
from textile factories
to iron smelts...
Yippee! Hooray!
But today, the age-old right
of children to work is under attack...
From the Philippines to Bangladesh,
in China and India...
and South America too...
But you can help
these children, Derek...
by killing the prime minister
ofMalaysia...
- He is bad...
- What?
You learn martial arts...
Prime minister ofMalaysia bad!
Martial arts good!
Kill naughty man!
Obey my dog!
On the runway,
you have one objective...
Do not be distracted
by the beautiful celebrities...
Do as you've been trained to do and
kill the Malaysian prime minister!
Karate chop! Bad, man! Awful man!
In your little blue suit
and your spiky black hair... Kill!
And you're
a super-hot ninja machine!
- Derek, are you in there?
- Hold your horses!
- Derek, please open the door!
- What a cuckoo dream.
- What?
- Hey, are you okay?
I've been trying to reach you
for a week.
A week? What,
are you having a whack attack?
I saw you this afternoon, dum-dum.
That was last Friday.
Earth to Matilda.
I was at a day spa.
Day. D-A-I-Y-E. Okay?
Look, I think I know
what this is about...
and I'm very complimented
but not interested.
- What?
- I can't sleep with you, okay?
- My head is killing me and...
- What are you talking about?
Okay, if you just want
to fool around a little bit...
Hey, I don't want to sleep with you!
I've been trying to tell you
you've been missing for a week.
Would you look at the date. Mugatu's
Derelicte show is tomorrow night.
I don't care what the date says.
You have 1,200 messages...
That is a bit above average.
- Derek, what happened in that spa?
- I don't know.
A little massage,
some aromatherapy.
I mean, look, lady, you can't just
come barging into people's lofts...
wanting sex,
then changing your mind...
then telling them that they've been
in a day spa for a week...
You have been in a day spa
for a week.
So what?
Do you understand that the world
does not revolve around you...
and your "do whatever it takes,
ruin as many people's lives"...
so long as you can make a name
foryourself as a journalist...
no matter how many friends
you lose...
or people you leave dead
and bloodied along the way...
just so long as you can make a name
foryourself as a journalist...
no matter how many friends
you lose...
or people you leave dead and
bloodied and dying along the way?
I told you I was sorry
about that article.
Enough! My head hurts!
And if it indeed is
what day you claim it is...
I have a pre-runway party
to attend, if you'll excuse me.
- By the way...
- What?
With your complexion...
you really shouldn't be wearing
your hair pulled back that tight.
What are you talking about?
It pulls back the skin
on your forehead...
creating a tension
which clogs the pores.
That's why you have some light
pattern dryness around your scalp.
Do you mind?
Cool.
I do not like snoopy reporter
with lack of fashion sense.
Not one little bit.
Not one little bit.
Hey, I just E-mailed you
all those searches...
on the male models who've
appeared in Mugatu campaigns.
It's pretty weird. It seems
like all of Mr. Mugatu's models...
have a bad habit of dying young
in freak accidents.
What?
- Wait a second.
- What?
- Oh, shit. I gotta go.
- What's going on?
I don't want to hang out, okay?
I just need to speak
with Derek Zoolander, please!
I just thought the way you handled
losing that award to Hansel...
and then you sort of laid low
for a while...
and then made your comeback...
It was so courageous.
Look, I gotta go pee...
but I'd really like to continue
talking about this conversation.
Yeah.
- Everything cool, Derek?
- It's great, Biff. Thank you.
Hey, Derek. You rule.
Thanks, Paris.
I appreciate that.
- Hey, Derek.
- Hey, Maurice.
- Hey, my man.
- What's happening?
Derek, back on top, man.
Thanks, Billy. You rock.
No, you rock. When are you gonna
drop Magnum on us, buddy?
Not yet. Gotta tame the beast
before you let it out of its cage.
- Excuse me, bra.
- You're excused.
And I'm not your bra.
Whatever, dude. Whatever.
Peace. God bless.
Hey, Hansel, I'm sorry you didn't
get Mugatu's Derelicte campaign.
Maybe next time.
What's that?
Mugatu's Derelicte campaign.
Sorry you didn't book it.
Oh, yeah?
I've never even heard of it.
Me and my friends have been too busy
bathing off of St. Barts...
with spider monkeys
for the past two weeks.
Tripping on acid changed
our whole perspective on shit.
So I guess you can "dere-lick"
my balls, capitan...
Would you hold this for me?
I can "dere-lick" my own balls,
thank you very much.
You think you're
too cool for school.
But I got a news flash
for you, Walter Cronkite.
You aren't.
Who are you trying
to get crazy with, ese?
Don't you know I'm loco?
Hey, I got a wacky idea.
What say we settle this
on the runway...
Han-solo?
Stop it.
Are you challenging me
to a walk-off...
Boo-lander?
Don't do this, Derek.
Listen to your friend Billy Zane.
He's a cool dude.
He's trying to help you out.
Oh, yeah. That's a walk-off
challenge, my friend.
Ten minutes.
Old Members Only warehouse.
You oughta remember that.
You're a dinosaur.
Let's go. Open up.
I heard some mad stories
about this kid. He's too limber.
Put a cork in it, Zane!
It's a walk-off.
This is urgent, ma'am.
Do you have any...
Hey, Matilda.
What is this?
Where is everyone going?
Good luck, Derek!
Kick Hansel's ass!
Thanks, Rico. I'll try.
You want to see the real world
of male modeling?
The one they don't show you
in magazines or the E Channel?
Yeah, I guess. Derek, please.
I have something really important
to talk to you about.
Not now, Matilda.
Han-sell-out is about
to have his Han-sell-ass...
handed to him on a platter
with french-fried potatoes.
Katinka, thought you might
want to know...
your boy Zoolander's rolling.
It's a walk-off.
All right,
who's gonna call this sucker?
If nobody has any objections...
I believe I might be of service.
Now, this'll be a straight walk-off,
old school rules.
First model walks, second model
duplicates, then elaborates.
Okay, boys, let's go to work.
Age before beauty, goat cheese.
Whatever.
Right.
Playskool, baby.
You gotta cut me. I can't see.
I'm blind out there.
Evian.
It's okay.
- Where am I?
- It's okay.
- Kickin', Hoss.
- I'm going monk.
I gotta go monk. Prayer.
Pray to the Great Spirit.
Do it, Hansel.
Why is he sticking his hand
in his pants?
Do it, Hansel.
- That's what I'm talking about.
- Derek, you're not a kid anymore.
You could hurt yourself out there.
I can do this, Tyson.
Thank God I wore underweartoday...
He's going for it.
Oh, my God.
Disqualified.
- Derek, come on.
- Come on.
- Derek, come on.
- Come on.
What's going on?
I think Katinka wants to kill you.
Good. I deserve to die if I can't
beat Han-suck-ass in a walk-off.
Derek, that's not true.
The guy had to pull his underwear
out of his butt just to beat you.
And all he had to do
was turn left.
What do you mean?
I'm not an ambi-turner.
It's a problem I had
since I was a baby.
I can't turn left.
Derek, that's nothing
to be ashamed of.
I'm sure there are a lot of people
out there who can't turn...
There have got to be some people
out there, just like you...
who can't turn... turn left.
If you want answers,
come to Saint Adonis Cemetery now...
- Wait! Who are you?
- Who was that?
I'm not sure. I have to get
to Saint Adonis Cemetery.
I'm gonna take you to my apartment.
You can stay there until I get back.
Can I come with?
I don't want to be alone tonight.
"Pedro Scialfa"'
He died when he was 29.
"Vin Correjo"'
"Derriere Extraordinaire"'
Ninety-two minus sixty-three.
None of them ever made it past 30.
I did.
Who are you?
It's not important.
Are you a ghost?
He called, Derek.
Let's take a walk.
You think Zoolander's in trouble?
Think again.
What you've stumbled upon goes way
deeper than you could ever fathom.
The fashion industry
has been behind...
every major political assassination
over the last 200 years.
And behind every hit,
a card-carrying male model.
Okay, that's impossible.
Oh, yeah?
Listen and learn, sweetness.
Abe Lincoln wanted to abolish
slavery, right?
But who do you think made the
powdered wigs and leg stockings...
worn by our country's
early leaders?
Mugatu!
Slaves, Derek.
Without their free labor,
prices would have gone up tenfold.
So the powers that be
hired John Wilkes Booth...
the original model/actor,
to do Mr... Lincoln in...
I'll go on.
Dallas, Texas, 1963.
Kennedy had just put
a trade embargo on Cuba...
ostensibly halting the shipment
of Cuban-manufactured slacks.
Incredibly popular item
at the time.
Lee Harvey Oswald
was not a male model.
You're goddamn right he wasn't.
But those two lookers...
who capped Kennedy from the grassy
knoll sure as shit were.
Well, what about you?
How do you fit in to all this?
This nation was swept...
I'll get it, ma'am.
I can't get over...
Wait a minute.
I know that hand.
It was in the fall 1973
Bulova watch catalog.
You're J.P. Prewitt.
The world's greatest hand model.
Once upon a time.
But things change.
Thanks to this homemade
hyperbaric chamber...
my sweet baby never did.
Let's keep moving.
And that's when I found out I was
in line to assassinate Jimmy Carter.
- So, how'd you manage to escape?
- Because I'm a hand model, mama.
A finger jockey. We don't think
the same as the face and body boys.
- We're a different breed.
- So why male models?
Think about it, Derek.
Male models are genetically
constructed to become assassins...
They're in peak
physical condition...
They can gain entry to the most
secure places in the world.
And most important of all,
models don't think for themselves.
- They do as they're told.
- That is not true.
Yes it is, Derek.
Yeah. Think about any photo shoot
you've ever been on.
You're a monkey, Derek!
Dance, monkey,
in your little spangly shoes!
Mash your cymbals, chimpy!
Dance, Derek, dance!
Good point.
But if this has been going on
for so long, Mugatu...
He's just a punk-ass errand boy...
working for an international
syndicate of fashion designers.
You do a little background check
on your Mr. Mugatu.
You'll find he sold his soul to the
devil for a shot at the big time.
But why male models?
Are you serious? I just...
I just told you that a moment ago.
Right.
You're a killing machine, Derek.
They've programmed you.
But I won't do it.
I won't kill anybody.
It's not up to you. At the proper
moment, they'll triggeryou.
Usually using an auditory or visual
Pavlovian response mechanism.
- "Audi-what-ey"?
- And when it's over...
What? There's an after party?
Derek, get down!
You gotta get
to Maury Ballstein's computer.
He recorded everything
in case they ever turned on him.
Derek, get a grip!
Good luck to you, Derek. I've
always been a fan of Blue Steel.
And I hear Magnum
is gonna blow us all away.
Come on!
- Get out of here.
- Hang in there,J.P.
You freakin' idiot!
Man, that was close... I can't
believe Maury's in on it too...
That she-male Katinka's
not messing around...
You're telling me!
For a second there...
I thought someone was gonna
be reading our "eugoogoly"
Okay, all right,
we need a place to hide.
Where's the last place anyone
would ever expect to look foryou?
I don't know.
Think, okay?
This is important!
I hate Hansel! Hansel, Hansel!
Everywhere I look! Hansel!
Were you looking for a rematch?
Excuse me, Hansel. I don't think
there's an easy way to put this...
so I am just gonna lay it out.
Derek has been brainwashed...
to kill the prime minister
of Malaysia.
And?
And we need a place to hide until
we figure this whole thing out.
Derek said this would be the last
place anyone would look for him.
Yeah, you're cool to hide here.
But first, me and him
gotta straighten some shit out.
Fine.
Why you been acting
so messed up towards me?
Why you been acting
so messed up towards me?
Well, you go first.
I don't know. Maybe I felt
a little threatened or something...
'cause your career
is kind of just blossoming...
and mine's kind ofwinding down
or whatever.
And I felt like,
"This guy's really hurting me"...
and it hurt.
And I felt like when you told me
to "dere-lick" my balls...
that really hurt.
Maybe I was scared, man.
You're Derek Zoolander!
Yeah, you're Derek Zoolander.
You know what it's like to be
another model in Zoolander's shadow?
You want to hear something crazy?
Your work...
in the winter '95
International Male catalog...
made me want to be a model.
I freakin' worship you, man.
I'm sorry I was whack.
I was whack.
I was whack.
So welcome to chez Hansel.
You're welcome to hide out here
as long as you want.
Well, there isn't much time.
The show's tomorrow night.
We have to figure out
a plan by then.
I'll round up the troops here.
Hey, what's up, y'all?
This is Derek and Matilda.
Derek, you know Natani and Chloe.
We got Buzzy Sullivan,
big wave surfer from Maverick's.
Hey, bra.
Oh, this is this fantastic band,
the Little Kings...
I met when I was ice sailing
in Finland.
That's my Sherpa, Lapsang.
Hey, everybody!
Listen up for a second.
Derek and Matilda are hiding 'cause
some dudes brainwashed Derek...
to off the prime minister
of Micronesia.
- Malaysia.
- Right.
So, they're gonna be hiding here.
Let's show them a good time.
- Right on!
- All right, come on, over here.
Oh, hey, Ennui,
will you do me a favor?
Will you get me some of that tea
that me and Lapsang got...
when we were climbing
the Mayan ruins?
This is really strong tea.
No, it's just right.
Trust me.
What with all the intrigue
you guys have been dealing with.
You know, Matilda, I'm surprised
you're so worried about "Der-rock"'
From that article that I read,
it seems like...
you don't really care too much
about guys in our line ofwork.
Why do you hate models, Matilda?
- Honestly?
- Yes.
I think they're vain, stupid...
and incredibly self-centered.
I totally agree with you.
But how do you feel
about male models?
Sweet.
Okay, but seriously, Matil.
Is it all right if I call you Matil?
What's the deal, yo-yo?
You're not telling us everything.
There's something else, isn't there?
You guys really want
to know the truth?
- Yeah.
- Then I'm gonna tell you the truth.
When I was in seventh grade...
I was the fat kid in my class.
All right, forget it.
- No.
- Dude, be cool tonight. Come on.
I'm sorry.
Please, go ahead. My mistake.
I was the one that all the pretty
girls used to make fun of.
It was an awkward phase.
Anyway...
every day after school,
I would come home and...
you know, I'd flip through the pages
of my mom's Vogue and Glamour...
And I just...
I'd look at these women...
these perfect, beautiful...
just unbelievable, skinny women.
I just couldn't...
Oh, I couldn't understand
why I didn't look like them.
I just didn't get it.
So, um...
So I became...
What?
Bulimic.
You can read minds?
It's when you throw up
after every meal.
See, this is exactly
what you models do to people.
You make them feel bad
about themselves.
So what?
I throw up after lots of meals.
So do I. It's a great way
to lose pounds before a show.
Are you guys insane?
Do you understand? It's a disease.
How'd that affect you with guys?
Did they not want to get busy?
- Good point.
- Oh. Okay. You know what?
I'm not gonna sit here with both
of you and discuss my sex life or...
Or lack thereof.
Ooh, you mean,
like, like you, like you...
- Haven't really done it...
- You haven't done it...
Done it in a while, yeah.
Okay, what's a while?
Like, eight days?
More?
Oh, try a couple years.
- Oh!
- Oh, snap!
How do you live?
Seriously. Do you service yourself
ten times a day?
- End of discussion!
- Easy. Okay, hold on.
- Easy, easy.
- I'm not comfortable talking...
Easy.
This has been
an emotional day for all of us.
I think we should get naked.
What?
Don't ask questions.
Just give in to the power
of the tea.
So I'm repelling down
Mount Vesuvius...
when suddenly I slip
and I start to fall.
I mean, I'm about to die.
Hot bread, Zeke.
I mean, I'm about to die.
Hot bread, Zeke.
Just falling...
I'll never forget the terror.
When suddenly I remember,
"Holy shit. Hansel...
haven't you been smoking peyote
for six straight days?
And couldn't some of this,
maybe, be in your mind??'
And?
It was. I was totally fine.
I've never even been
to Mount Vesuvius.
Cool story, Hansel.
Thanks, Olaf.
Dude, how dope was last night?
I mean, the soil room.
Dirt was flying.
You couldn't see anything.
It was like, whoa, who's that?
- Who's this?
- I think I'm falling for Matilda.
Dude,
I wasn't gonna say anything...
but it was crazy energy flying
back and forth between you guys.
It was like, whoa, look out!
There was a moment last night...
when she was between the two Finnish
dwarves and the Maori tribesman...
- Oh, yeah.
- Where I thought...
"Wow, I could really spend the rest
of my life with this woman"'
Really?
What do you call that?
I think you call that love, D-Bone.
So what time is it?
- Almost 5:.00.
- What?
Hey, guys,
that show is in three hours.
Derek is dead unless we get
that evidence. Do you guys...
Whoa, easy. How about a
"Good afternoon, Derek and Hansel.
Thanks for the freak fest
last night"?
- Hello?
- Hello?
Oh, hi, Katinka.
Uh, no, I just had a really late
party night last night.
- Derek, hang up the phone now!
- Where am I?
- I have to go! See you at 7::00.
- Hang up!
Derek, I thought I told you
to turn off your phone.
Turn off my phone?
Turn off my phone?
- Yeah.
- Earth to Matilda.
This phone is as much
a part of me as...
You know what? Can we cut it out
with all the "Earth to's," please?
We're not actually saying this is
the Earth calling you, Matilda.
Yeah. No, I got that. I understand
you don't literally mean...
Uh, no, I don't think you do.
Listen. It's not like we thinkwe're
actually in a control tower...
trying to reach outer space
aliens or something, okay?
Hello.
- Oh, snap!
- A joke.
Instead of doing that, I'm gonna try
to figure out a way into Maury's...
before Derek assassinates
a world leader.
Wait.
I have an idea.
They'll be looking for us
at Maury's, right?
But they won't be
looking for not us.
What are you talking about?
Hansel, do you have
a cosmetics case?
Sure, I mean,
just for touch-ups or whatever.
What are you gonna do with that?
That'll do. Early in my career...
I used to do my own makeup
styling and tailoring.
If I can create
a basic disguise for us...
we may just be able to sneak
into Maury's, undetected.
You is talkin' loco,
and I like it.
Wielcome to Derelicte...
Hansel calling Matil.
We have entry. Repeat.
- Wie have entry...
- Okay, guys. I hear you.
Now, once you get the info, I want
you to E-mail it to my office.
I'll download the files, and we'll
take the information to the police...
We hear you loud and clear.
Listen, Matil.
I've been thinking a lot
about that bulimia thing...
And I want you to know I understand
where you're coming from.
I feel really bad that
good-looking people like us...
made you throw up
and feel bad about yourself.
For serious.
- Thanks, Derek. Now, hurry up.
- Okay.
I got the results on the name check
you asked for on Jacobim Mugatu.
- Or should I say Jacob Moogberg.
- What?
He changed his name when he went
into the fashion business.
Apparently, the guy was the
original guitar synth player...
for that band Frankie Goes to
Hollywood, but he got kicked out...
before they hit it big
with that song "Relax"'
After Frankie gave him the heave-ho,
he held a series of odd jobs until...
get this... he invented...
the piano key necktie in 1 985.
The guy's been
a fashion designer ever since.
First obstacle.
You ever use one of these?
I don't think so.
Watch out. Watch...
Fix that hem,Jason.
Please. I need... Katinka!
He's not here yet,Jacobim.
- That little toad-face better show.
- He will show.
Good, because I'm a hot
little potato right now.
There must be
an "on" button somewhere.
Did you press that apple thing?
Wait! Hansel!
Let's not lose our cool. Then
we're no better than the machine.
It's almost 7::00.
I gotta go.
No! Derek. Der, wait.
If you go, they'll make you
kill that Eurasian dude.
I don't care, Hansel. I've never
been late for a show in my life.
I don't plan on starting now.
Damn it, you're right.
Do me a favor. If anything happens
to me, give this to Matilda.
- Oh, no.
- Please, Hansel. Take it. Please.
- Ah, man.
- Take it.
Let's just say I'll hold on
to it till you get back.
Go!
Wie're live at the Derelicte show...
where controversial designer
Jacobim Mugatu...
has extended the olive branch to
Malaysian Prime Minister Hassan...
making him the guest ofhonor
at tonight's show...
And starring in that show,
veteran supermodel Derek Zoolander...
Guys, what's happening?
Did you find the files?
Matilda, we've got problems...
Derek's already left for the show...
No. No, he can't. We don't
even know what the tri gger is.
He just went running out of here.
I couldn't stop him.
- I'll call him on his phone.
- He doesn't have it.
- What?
- Yeah, he doesn't have it.
What are you talking about?
He always has it.
- No, he gave it to me.
- Did you find the files?
I don't even know what they...
What do they look like?
They're in the computer.
They're in the computer?
Yeah, they're definitely in there...
I don't know how he labeled them...
- I got it.
- You gotta figure it out...
- I got it.
- You gotta figure it out...
We're running out of time.
Find them and meet me at the show.
Roger.
In the computer.
It's so simple.
Hey, I just cut up
a couple of canta loupe halves...
with some cottage cheese,
if you're hungry.
Not the right time.
I need to figure out this trigger...
before Derek kills
the Malaysian prime minister.
You just seem a little tense.
I was trying to help you relax.
Relax? The last thing I need
to do right now is rela...
- That's it.
- Let's go, people!
Let's go! Vagrants and whores,
you're wanted in Makeup!
Runaways and street hustlers,
you're next!
- You had us worried, Derek.
- Everything's cool.
- I'm really psyched for the show.
- Good.
Just remember, relax.
Two minutes, Derek.
Ah, there he is.
I just want to wish you good luck.
Don't you mean "good-bye"?
What are you talking...
I know it was you, Maury.
I know it was you...
and it breaks my heart.
Derek, I don't know
what you're talking...
Derek, I'm...
I'm sorry.
Glad you could join us, Kmart.
Lucky for you,
there is no dress code.
Lucky for you,
there is no dress code.
I am vile spew...
ofthe wretched masses...
I am really, really dirty...
I am Derelicte!
You make me sick
to my stomach, Jaco.
It'll all be over soon.
Derek Zoolander will be dead,
and you'll be fine.
You always are.
Come on, Derek. You're on.
Break a leg, Derek.
It's "Relax"!
I'm fine.
I've done this a thousand times.
The trigger! It's "Re"...
Concentrate, Derelicte...
Do not be distracted
by the beautiful celebrities...
Celebrities...
Do what you've been trained to do,
and kill the prime minister!
J ust do it al ready!
I got your back!
What?
It's that damn Hansel!
He's so hot ri ght now!
Popping and locking, fool!
They're break-dance fighting.
Derek Zoolander just tried to kill
the prime minister of Malaysia.
That's bullshit!
Listen up, everyone.
Mugatu's a dick!
He tried to brainwash Derek
to kill the Claymation dude.
That's a lie! Zoolander snapped
because he's over the hill!
He knew his career was over,
and he couldn't face it.
No way. We got 30 years of files
right here in this computer!
They're gonna bring you down!
Oh, no.
Down!
Where did all the files go?
Ha! I'm taking you out!
- Yo, taste my pain, bitch!
- Huh?
- Yes!
- Deal with that!
You don't have the guts, Kmart!
Wanna bet? And by the way...
you were wrong about my outfit.
It's the Cheryl Ladd Collection,
and I got it at J.C. Penney.
On sale.
Jig's up, Mugatu.
Everything they're saying is true.
I've been in on it for 30 years.
What are you doing, Ballstein?
I'm done,Jaco. I got a prostate
the size of a honeydew...
and a head full of bad memories.
It's time to set things straight.
You have no evidence.
Han-stupid destroyed everything.
I got two words foryou, sugar...
Zip disk.
The whole thing is in my den
in Long Island.
I can have that evidence here
in 20 minutes.
- That a boy, Maury.
- Hold on a second.
I'm afraid of the radiation.
Sheila, honey, it's me. Listen.
I need you to bring that Zip disk
in the den down to the fashion show.
I don't care
what the traffic is like.
Take the goddamn service road
and get off before the bridge.
So put it in one of those
Tupperware containers...
and I'll heat it up in
the microwave when I get home.
For Christ's sake, it's a casserole,
Sheila! It'll stay!
Shut up!
Enough already, Ballstein!
Who cares about
Derek Zoolander anyway?
The man has only one look,
for Christ's sake!
Blue Steel, Ferrari, Le Tigre?
They're the same face!
Doesn't anyone notice this?
I feel like I'm taking crazy pills!
I invented the piano key necktie!
I invented it!
What have you done, Derek? Nothing!
You've done nothing! Nothing!
And I will be a monkey's uncle
if I have you ruin this for me!
Because if you can't
get the job done, then I will!
Die, you wage-hiking scum!
One look?
One look? I don't think so!
There it is!
Magnum!
Holy moly.
Yeah, baby!
That's what I've been waiting for!
Dear God.
It's beautiful.
Yeah!
That's my kid.
That's my son.
That's my son.
Whoa! Yeah!
I love that kid.
Dumb as a stump, but I love him.
Oh, Derek, you did it!
That was amazing!
I know. I turned left!
Yeah, that too. But you saved
the prime minister of Malaysia!
Oh, right. Cool.
Thank you, Derek Zoolander,
for saving my life.
Hi, I'm former male supermodel
Derek Zoolander.
Here, at the Derek Zoolander Center
for Kids Who Can't Read Good...
and Who Wanna Learn
to Do Other Stuff Good Too...
we teach students of all ages...
everything they need to know to
learn to be a professional model...
and a professional human being.
Our diverse faculty includes
business management teacher...
and former model agent
Maury Ballstein.
The designer's got your nuts
in a vise...
offering you ten million
plus three percent...
of every pair
of underwear sold.
What are you gonna do?
Screw him! Hold out for more!
That's what I'm talking about!
Sojoin now, because at the
Derek Zoolander Center for Kids...
Who Can't Read Good and Wanna Learn
to Do Other Stuff Good Too...
we teach you
that there's more to life...
than just being really,
really, really good-looking.
- Right, kids?
- Right!
And cut!
- Looks great. I think we got it.
- All right, Mitch. Thanks.
- All right! That's a wrap!
- Hey, Hansel.
I'm gonna take these kids over
to the George Washington Bridge...
give them a little lesson
in base jumping.
- Catch you at the teacher's lounge?
- All right.
All right, guys. Last one to the
helicopter's a rotten egg. Let's go!
- There's Daddy! Hi.
- Hey.
- How's Derek, Jr.?
- He's great.
Guess what.
He made his first look today.
- Really?
- You wanna show Daddy your look?
Wow.
- Wanna hang out for story hour?
- Great. Yeah. Let's go.
- Hey, who wants to hear a story?
- Yeah!
