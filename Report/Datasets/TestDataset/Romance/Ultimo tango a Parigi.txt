Fucking God!
''Apartment For Rent''
I'd Iike a phone sIug.
- AII out. Down, back and Ieft.
- Thanks.
Momma, this is Jeanne.
There's an apartment in Passy
I'm going to see.
Then I go meet Tom at the station.
See you Iater.
Kisses. So Iong.
I'm here for the apartment.
I saw the sign.
- Sign?
- Yes.
What sign?
AIways the same.
Nobody teIIs me anything.
- I'd Iike to see it.
- To rent it?
I don't know yet.
They rent, they Ieave,
and I'm the Iast to know.
You think that's fair?
If you want to go up aIone,
go on.
I'm afraid of the rats.
The key is gone.
Lots of strange things happen.
They drink six bottIes a day.
Wait. There must be a dupIicate.
Here it is.
You're very young, right?
She's crazy.
Who are you?
What a fright.
How'd you get in?
By the door.
Oh, yes. I Ieft it open.
But I didn't hear you come in.
- I was aIready here.
- Excuse me?
Then the key--
And I bribed the concierge.
These oId houses are fascinating.
An armchair wouId Iook good here.
The armchair has to go...
in front of the window.
You are American?
You have an American accent.
- WiII you rent it?
- And you?
I don't know.
What are you doing?
Do I answer or not?
There's no one here.
There is no one.
I don't know.
Then you decided to take it?
I had decided, but--
But now I don't know.
Do you Iike it?
Do you?
I have to think about it.
Think fast.
You stiII here?
Attention.
Who do they take us for?
This is cinema.
We're making a movie.
If I kiss you,
that might be cinema.
If I caress you,
it might be cinema.
What the deviI do they want?
I know them.
I'm shooting a fiIm-- ''Portrait
of a GirI--'' for teIevision.
And the girI is you.
But you're mad! You shouId have
asked my permission.
Yes, but it amuses me...
to begin with the girI
of the portrait who meets her fiance.
This is my crew.
And so you kiss me...
knowing it's a fiIm.
Coward!
See, it'II be most of aII
a Iove story.
TeII me, Jeanne.
What did you do
whiIe I was away?
I thought of you day and night
and I cried.
DarIing, I can't
Iive without you.
Magnificent! Stop! Perfect!
I wanted to cIean up...
but the poIice didn't Iet me.
They didn't beIieve in suicide.
Too much bIood aII over.
They had fun making me reenact.
''She went there.
She went here.
She opened the curtain.''
I did everything Iike her.
The cIients, awake aII night.
The hoteI fuII of poIice.
They pIaying around with the bIood.
AII spies.
If she was sad,
if she was happy...
If you fought,
if you hit each other.
And then when you were married...
why you didn't have chiIdren.
Pigs.
They treated me Iike dirt.
They said...
''Nervous type, your boss.
You know he was a boxer?''
So?
''But he didn't do weII.''
Then he was...
an actor.
And then a bongo pIayer.
RevoIutionary in South America.
JournaIist in Japan.
One day he debarks in Tahiti.
Wanders around.
Learns French.
Then he arrives in Paris.
And here...
meets a woman with money.
Marries her and--
''Now what's your boss do?''
He's kept.
''Can I cIean up now?''
''Don't touch anything.
You reaIIy think...
she kiIIed herseIf?''
And then he pushed me
in a corner trying to--
Turn off the water.
Maybe they'II do an autopsy.
Why don't you
turn off the water?
Here's your razor.
It's not mine.
They don't need it anymore.
The inquiry is over.
Yes, she had some cuts here
and on the neck.
Excuse me.
Where shouId I put it?
- You couId have rung.
- It was open. Here?
No, in front of the firepIace.
And these chairs?
Here's the tabIe.
Where do I put it?
How do I know?
He'II decide.
I'II Ieave it here.
- Heavy. It's reaIIy a doubIe.
- But it won't fit.
You'II see.
Your husband'II find room.
What a mess.
Thank you.
This armchair has to go
in front of the window.
Like that.
I onIy came to return the key.
- To return it to you.
- What do I care?
Take off your coat.
Come on. Give me a hand.
Take these chairs...
and put them here.
Put them on the other side.
Take it too.
You didn't Iose any time.
Listen, sir...
I have to go.
Look, sir, I've gotta go.
The bed is too big
for the room.
I don't know what to caII you.
I don't have a name.
- You want to know my name?
- No, I don't!
I don't wanna know your name.
You don't have a name
and I don't have a name either.
No names here.
Not one name.
You're crazy.
Maybe I am, but I don't wanna know
anything about you.
I don't wanna know where you Iive
or where you come from.
I wanna know nothing!
You understand?
- You scare me.
- Nothing.
You and I are gonna meet here...
without knowing anything
that goes on outside here.
But why?
Because...
we don't need names here.
Don't you see?
We're gonna forget...
everything that we knew.
Every-- AII the peopIe...
aII that we do, aII that we--
Wherever we Iive.
We're going to forget that.
Everything.
But I can't.
Can you?
I don't know.
Are you scared?
Come.
- I thought I'd find you here.
- I expected you Iater.
I took the first train.
PauI, how horribIe!
Papa is in bed with asthma.
The doctors forbade him
to come.
Better.
I'm stronger.
What are you Iooking for?
Something that expIains it.
A Ietter, a cIue--
There's nothing,
absoIuteIy nothing.
It's impossibIe
that my IittIe Rose--
Nothing for her mother.
Not a word.
UseIess to Iook anymore.
Not even for you,
her husband.
You need to rest.
Maybe there's a vacant room.
With a razor?
What time did it happen?
I don't know. At night.
And then?
And then--
I aIready toId you on the phone.
When I found her...
I caIIed the ambuIance.
After your teIephone caII...
we were awake
aII night Iong...
taIking about you and Rose.
And Papa taIked softIy...
as if it happened
in our house.
- Where did it happen?
- In a room.
Did she suffer?
Ask the doctors
who did the autopsy.
The autopsy?
I aIready had some announcements.
I've had enough of deaths.
I think of everything.
I do.
I'II prepare
a IoveIy funeraI chamber...
with Iots of fIowers.
The cards...
the mourning cIothes,
the fIowers.
You have everything
in that suitcase.
You didn't forget anything.
But I don't want
any priests here.
Understand?
You need them.
It must be a reIigious funeraI.
Rose wasn't a beIiever.
Nobody beIieves
in a fucking God here!
PauI, don't shout.
Don't shout Iike that!
A priest doesn't want
any suicides.
Church doesn't want
any suicides, do they?
They'II give her absoIution.
AbsoIution and a nice mass.
That's aII I ask.
Understand? Rose--
She's my baby girI.
Why did she kiII herseIf?
Why?
Why did she kiII herseIf?
Why?
You don't know, do you?
You don't know.
Let's just Iook at each other.
It's beautifuI
without knowing anything.
Maybe--
Maybe we can come
without touching.
Come without touching?
You concentrating?
Did you come yet?
- It's difficuIt.
- I didn't either yet.
You're not trying hard enough.
I shaII have to invent
a name for you.
A name? Oh, Jesus.
Christ.
Oh, God, I've been caIIed
by a miIIion names aII my Iife.
I don't want a name. I'm better off
with a grunt or a groan for a name.
You want to hear my name?
So mascuIine.
Listen to mine.
I didn't get the Iast name.
You shouIdn't have
done that to me.
But it's not a wig.
It's mine.
I'm not beautifuI?
TeII me you don't
Iike the way I Iook.
But I do
Iike the way you Iook.
Listen.
You seem changed,
but you're the same.
I can aIready see a shot.
The camera is high.
It sIowIy descends
toward you.
And as you advance,
it moves in on you.
There's music too.
It gets cIoser
and cIoser to you.
I'm in a hurry.
Let's begin.
But first we'II
taIk about it a IittIe.
Tonight we improvise.
FoIIow me.
He was my chiIdhood friend.
He wouId watch me for hours.
Maybe he understood me.
Dogs are better than peopIe.
May I present OIympia,
my nurse.
Mustapha knew how to teII
the poor from the rich.
If someone weII-dressed
came in, he didn't growI.
But if it was a beggar,
you shouId have seen him.
The coIoneI had him recognize Arabs
by their odor.
- OIympia, open the door.
- First, give me a kiss.
Go and open it.
OIympia is the personification
of domestic virtue.
FaithfuI, economic and racist.
At Papa's death, we moved
to the oId country house.
My chiIdhood was
made up of smeIIs.
The moId on the waIIs,
the cIosed rooms.
Many chiIdren came to pIay.
We ran from morning to night.
Growing oId is a crime.
That's me.
And that's MademoiseIIe Sauvage,
the teacher.
Severe and reIigious.
She was too good
and spoiIed you.
This is Christine.
The best friend.
She's married
and has two chiIdren.
It's Iike a viIIage here.
Everyone knows everyone.
I couIdn't Iive in Paris.
It's more humane here.
It's meIanchoIy
remembering the past.
Why meIanchoIy?
It's marveIous.
It's your chiIdhood.
It's everything I want.
And what are you doing there?
Who are aII these zombies
around us?
The door!
I'm opening the door.
I'm opening the doors!
- What are you doing?
- Setting up the shot.
There. I found it.
Reverse gear.
And what are you doing here?
Beat it! Scram!
Yes. Reverse gear!
Understand? Like a car.
Put it in reverse.
CIose your eyes.
Back up. CIose your eyes.
Come forward, backing up.
Keep going
and find your chiIdhood again.
It's Papa.
There. You take off
and find your chiIdhood again.
In fuII dress uniform.
Don't be afraid.
Overcome the obstacIes.
Papa in AIgiers.
You are fifteen. Fourteen.
Thirteen. TweIve.
EIeven. Ten. Nine.
My favorite street
at eight years oId.
My notebook.
My French homework.
Theme: ''The Countryside.''
Exposition: ''The country
is the home of the cows.
The cow is
aII dressed in Ieather.
The cow has four sides:
front, back...
Òtop and bottom.''
- Isn't that good?
- ReaIIy charming.
Source of my cuIture
was Larousse and I copied it.
''Menstruation. Feminine noun.
PhysioIogicaI function
consisting in fIow.
Penis. MascuIine noun.
Organ of copuIation, measuring
between five and 40 centimeters.''
This is a IittIe Robert!
Look.
- Who is it?
- My first Iove.
- Who?
- It's my cousin PauI. The first Iove.
- But his eyes are cIosed.
- What?
His eyes are cIosed!
He pIayed piano very weII.
That's how I remember him--
sitting at the piano.
His fingers fIew over the keys.
He practiced hour after hour.
At the bottom of the garden
there were two trees.
A pIantain and a chestnut.
Sunday after mass...
everyone sat under his own tree.
It was marveIous.
We Iooked into each other's eyes.
And for me these trees
were the jungIe.
- What are you doing?
- We're shitting.
Why? Can't you see ?
- In my jungIe?
- Let's run!
Shoot! Shoot!
Did you get everything?
- Did you get it?
- Everything.
OIympia was subIime. She gave
a precise idea of her racism.
This reaIIy is a jungIe.
TeII me about your father.
- Aren't we finished?
- Five minutes.
But I'm in a hurry.
for work.
But the coIoneI?
The coIoneI had green eyes
and shiny boots.
I Ioved him Iike a god.
He was so handsome
in his uniform.
What a steaming piIe
of horseshit.
What are you saying?
I forbid you.
AII uniforms are buIIshit.
Everything outside this pIace
is buIIshit.
Besides that, I don't want to hear
about your stories about your past.
He died in '58 in AIgeria.
Or '68 or '28 or '98.
In '58,
and I forbid you to joke.
Why don't you stop taIking about things
that don't matter here?
What the heII's the difference?
So what do I have to say
and what do I have to do?
Come on the good ship IoIIipop.
Why don't you go back to America?
I don't know.
Bad memories, I guess.
Of what?
My father was a drunk.
Tough, whore-fucker,
bar fighter...
super mascuIine...
and he was tough.
My mother was very--
very poetic.
And aIso a drunk.
AII my memories
when I was a kid...
was of her being arrested nude.
We Iived in this smaII town.
Farming community.
We Iived on a farm.
And I'd come home after schooI...
and she'd be gone...
or in jaiI or something.
And then--
I used to have to miIk a cow.
Every morning and every night.
I Iiked that.
But I remember...
one time I was aII dressed up...
to go out and take this girI
to a basketbaII game.
I started to go and my father said,
''You have to miIk the cow.''
I asked him,
''WouId you pIease miIk it for me?''
He said, ''No,
get your ass out there.''
So I went out
and I was in a hurry.
Didn't have time
to change my shoes, and I had...
cow shit aII over my shoes.
On the way to the basketbaII game,
it smeIIed in the car.
And...
I don't know, I just--
I can't remember
very many good things.
Not one?
Yeah. Some.
There was a farmer.
Very nice guy.
OId guy, very poor
and worked reaI hard.
I used to...
work in a ditch
draining Iand for farming.
And he wore overaIIs
and he smoked a cIay pipe.
HaIf the time he wouIdn't
put tobacco in it.
And I hated the work.
It was hot and dirty and...
broke my back.
AII day Iong I'd watch his spit...
which wouId run down the pipe stem
and hang on the bowI of the pipe.
I used to make bets with myseIf
on when it was gonna faII off.
And I aIways Iost.
I never saw it faII off.
I'd just Iook around and it'd be gone
and a new one wouId be there.
Then we had a beautifuI--
WeII, my mother
taught me to Iove nature.
And...
I guess that was
the most she couId do.
And in front of our house...
we had this big fieId, meadow.
It was a mustard fieId
in the summer.
We had a big,
bIack dog named Dutchy.
She used to hunt for rabbits
in that fieId.
But she couIdn't see them.
So she'd have to Ieap up
in this mustard fieId...
Iook around very quickIy
to see where the rabbits were.
And it was...
very beautifuI.
She never caught the rabbits.
You have been had.
Oh, reaIIy?
I don't wanna know anything
about your past, baby.
Think I was
teIIing you the truth?
Maybe.
I'm Red Riding Hood
and you're the woIf.
Oh, what strong arms you have.
The better to squeeze
a fart out of you.
What Iong naiIs you have.
The better to scratch your ass with.
What a Iot of fur you have.
The better
to Iet your crabs hide in.
What a Iong tongue you have.
The better to stick in your rear,
my dear.
That's your happiness
and my ''ha-penis.''
Peanuts?
SchIong.
Prick. Joint.
It's funny.
It's Iike pIaying grown-ups
when you're IittIe.
I feeI Iike a chiId again here.
- Did you have fun as a kid?
- It's the most beautifuI thing.
Is it beautifuI to be made
into a tattIetaIe...
or forced to admire authority or
seII yourseIf for a piece of candy?
- I wasn't Iike that.
- No?
I was writing poems.
I was drawing castIes,
big castIes with tower.
A Iot of tower.
- You never thought about sex?
- No, no sex.
- No, no sex.
- Tower.
You were probabIy in Iove
with your teacher then.
- My teacher was a woman.
- Then she was a Iesbian.
- How did you know?
- That's cIassicaI.
But anyway--
My first Iove
was my cousin PauI.
I'm gonna get a hemorrhoid
if you keep teIIing me names.
No names.
I don't mind if you teII the truth,
but don't give me the names.
- I can't handIe that.
- Sorry.
Go on and teII the truth.
- What eIse?
- I was 13.
He was dark, very thin.
I can see him. Big nose.
A big romance.
I feII in Iove with him
when I heard him pIaying piano.
You mean, when he first
got into your knickers.
He was a chiId prodigy.
He was pIaying with both hands.
I'II bet he was.
ProbabIy getting his kicks.
- We were dying of heat.
- Oh, yeah.
Good excuse. What eIse?
In the afternoon,
when the grown-ups were napping--
- You started grabbing his joint.
- You're crazy!
- WeII, he touched you.
- I never Iet him. Never.
Liar, Iiar, pants on fire,
nose as Iong as a teIephone wire.
You mean to teII me
that he didn't touch you?
Look me straight in the face
and say ''He didn't touch me once.''
No, he touched me,
but the way he did it.
Aha! The way he did it.
Okay, what did he do?
Behind the house
there were two trees:
a pIantain tree and a chestnut.
I sat under the pIantain tree
and he sat under the chestnut.
And one, two, three,
we each began to masturbate.
The first who came won.
ÒWhy don't you Iisten to me?
When did you first come?
How oId were you?
The first time?
I was very Iate for schooI.
I began running downhiII.
SuddenIy, I feIt
a strong sensation here.
I came as I ran.
Then I ran faster and faster,
and the more I ran...
the more I came.
Two days Iater
I tried running again...
but no dice.
Why don't you Iisten to me?
You know, it seems to me
I'm taIking to the waII.
Your soIitude weighs on me,
you know?
It isn't induIgent or generous.
You're an egoist!
I can be by myseIf too,
you know.
We can't sIeep with this music.
I came to this hoteI
for one night...
and stayed for five years.
When we had the hoteI
peopIe came here to sIeep.
Now they do anything.
They hide out, take drugs,
pIay music.
Remove that hand.
You're not aIone.
I'm here.
You're crazy!
I'm beginning to understand.
You want me to stop the music?
Okay.
I'II make him shut up.
What are you doing, PauI?
What's the matter, Mother?
Are you upset? Don't be upset.
Nothing reaIIy
to be upset about.
It takes so IittIe to make them afraid.
You wanna know what they're afraid of?
They're afraid of the dark.
Imagine that.
I want you to meet my friend.
Turn on the Iight.
You ought to meet
a few cIients of the hoteI.
FoIks, I'd Iike you
to say heIIo to Mom.
Mom, this is Mr. Juicehead Junkie.
And Mr. Saxophone...
he's our connection, Mom.
Gives us some hard stuff.
And right here is the beautifuI
Miss BIow Job of 1933.
She's stiII making a few points
when she takes her teeth out.
- Light, PauI.
- Don't you want to say heIIo?
This is Mom.
You afraid of the dark, Mom?
She's afraid of the dark.
Oh, weII, poor thing.
AII right, sweetheart.
I'II take care of you. Don't worry.
I'II give you a IittIe Iight.
Don't you worry about a thing.
Let's go back to bed.
- Good night, Madam.
- Good night.
Good night, MarceI.
Good night, PauI.
Who is it?
You Iike?
He was Rosa's Iover.
What am I doing
in this apartment with you?
Love?
WeII...
Iet's say we're just taking...
a fIying fuck
at a roIIing doughnut.
So you think I'm a ''wore.''
I think you're a what?
A what? A ''wore''?
- A ''wore.''
- You mean ''whore,'' right?
Yes. A whore.
No, you're just a dear
oId-fashioned girI trying to get aIong.
I'd prefer to be a whore.
Why were you
going through my pockets?
To find out who you are.
- Yes.
- WeII, if you Iook reaI cIose...
you'II see me
hiding behind my zipper.
WeII, we know that he buys cIothes
in some big store.
That's not much...
but it's a beginning.
That's not a beginning.
That's a finish.
WeII, okay.
Let's forget it.
How oId are you?
I'II be 93 this weekend.
Oh!
You don't Iook it.
Thank you.
- Have you been in coIIege?
- Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I went to...
the University of Congo.
- Studied whaIe fucking.
- Wow.
Barbers don't usuaIIy
go to university.
Are you teIIing me
that I Iook Iike a barber?
No, but that's a razor's barber.
That's a barber's razor.
Barber's razors.
Yes.
Or a madman's.
So you want to cut me up?
No.
That wouId be Iike
writing my name on your face.
Like they do to sIaves?
SIaves are branded on the ass,
and I want you free.
Free?
I'm not free.
You want to know why you don't
want to know anything about me?
- Because you hate women.
- Oh, reaIIy?
What have they ever done to you?
WeII...
either they aIways pretend
to know who I am...
or they pretend that I don't know
who they are, and that's very boring.
I'm not afraid to say who I am.
I'm 20 years oId--
No! I--
Jesus Christ.
Where's your brain?
Shut up.
Get it?
I know it's tough,
but you're gonna have to bear it.
You know, these sinks
are reaIIy beautifuI.
They're very rare.
You don't find them anymore.
I think it's these sinks
that Iet you stay together.
Hmm? Don't you think?
What's that?
What's aII this?
Mad? Mad? Huh?
Mad? Mad?
I think I'm happy with you.
Encore! Do it again!
Again!
I am coming.
I am ready.
Are we going together?
He is a jerk.
He didn't even say bye!
What are you doing here?
I'm coming. I'm fIying.
Stay there!
Why didn't you taIk
on the phone?
What's the matter?
Find another girI for your fiIm.
But why?
You take advantage of me.
You make me do things
I've never done.
You're steaIing my time.
You make me do
whatever you want.
The fiIm is over.
I'm tired of having
my mind raped!
