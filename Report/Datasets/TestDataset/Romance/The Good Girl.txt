Justine: As a girl,
you see the world
like a giant candy store...
filled with sweet candy
and such.
filled with sweet candy
and such.
But one day you look around
and see a prison...
and you're on death row.
You want to run...
or scream...
or cry.
But something's
locking you up.
Are the other folks
cows chewing cud
till the hour come
when their heads roll?
Or are they just
keeping quiet like you?
Planning their escape.
On your left, honey.
What's that cashier's name?
Can't say.
When did he start
working here?
Don't know. Yesterday.
Who is he?
Don't know. Can't say.
What are you doing?
It's called work,
princess.
Kind of fun.
You might want to
give it a go some day.
Woman, Listlessly Over P. A:
Attention, shoppers.
There's a Retail Rodeo special
on aisle 3.
Liquid Drain Cleaner,
Liquid Drain Cleaner
has churning power...
and it will churn
right through your pipes.
Ladies,
you need female plumbing.
Shove something clean and new
up your filthy pipes.
That's Liquid Drain Cleaner
on aisle 3.
Have a good day...
and thank you for shopping
at Retail Rodeo.
Hey, Justine.
Can I talk to you
for a second?
Yeah.
I was just curious, uh...
have you ever been
to a Bible study?
Yeah.
Yeah, well, we got
a good one going on
every Wednesday
at the First Church
of Nazarene.
Rodney comes,
Bonita comes.
You got any interest
in reading the Bible?
I have my own,
you know, beliefs.
Well, we don't preach
fire and brimstone.
gotta live by those.
Other than
the usual ways...
we're not interested
in scaring people.
We're about loving Jesus.
Mm-hmm. Yeah, I kind of like
my nights to myself.
Well, maybe you'll have
night after night
of eternal hellfire
all to yourself.
Just kidding you.
Drive safe.
Bye-bye.
Man: Hey, Justine.
Hey, Teeny.
How was your day?
The same. How was yours?
Wind was fipping up paint
in our eyes.
Paint stings.
Feel like
I've been attacked
by hornets
in my eyeballs.
Bubba, stand up.
Why?
Oh, for Christ sakes.
Look at that couch, Phil.
Y'all got paint all over it.
This ain't gonna come off.
I bet the... Damn it, Phil.
Including this gorgeous
eggplant shape...
I think we got
most of it up.
You two were stoned.
Keep frying
your brain like that...
you're gonna
slip off a ladder
and crack open
your head bone.
You do really stupid things
when you're high, Phil.
Like what?
Like sitting on my couch
with your big blue ass.
Everything
just turns to shit.
We're finally getting
nice things...
and then everything
just gets messed up.
Why is this TV buzzing?
Oh, it's the wind
doing that.
They say
the wind's coming in
different lately.
Different from what?
Justine:
What you reading?
Catcher in the Rye.
I'm named after it.
What's your name,
Catcher?
Holden.
After Holden Caulfield.
He's the main character.
What's he do?
He's put upon by society...
the hypocrisy of the world.
I notice that you're,
uh, not very social.
I'm a writer, so...
What do you write?
Novels, plays,
screenplays...
stories, poetry.
Gwen: That's good.
Now Justine will be
right over with you.
Where is she?
Oh, I better go.
W-What happens
at the end of your book?
Oh, he has
a nervous breakdown...
goes to
a mental hospital.
Hmm.
You don't get paid
to pick your crack.
You get paid to work.
I'm not sure
I can do makeovers.
Oh, come on. A little
pancake, eyeliner...
mascara,
rouge on the cheeks...
and powder it up.
And then you take
a moist tissue...
roll it in a ball...
and toss it
in their face.
Geez Louise, I'm talking
to a tree stump, girl.
Where are you?
Sorry. I'm just
a little tired.
I'm telling you...
it's the food you eat,
Justine.
Look at me... I am
and I've got
'Cause I don't eat meat,
and I don't eat dairy.
It's probably why you can't
get pregnant, honey.
Why you walk around
with that hung-jaw look
on your face.
It's the cheese
in your pizza
and the chicken
in your salad.
I've been to the doctor.
He says I'm fertile.
Says I could repopulate
the entire planet.
Then what's the deal here?
Did he say you're
getting enough vitamins?
He didn't say.
Phil: Or you can make
a kind of paint
where,
at different angles...
the house
is different colors.
Like, you stand
at the front door...
and the house is red.
But you stand
at the street...
the house is green.
Or you could make, like,
an invisible paint.
Just make
the whole house disappear.
Or what would be really neat
is a paint that could
change the molecular structure
of a house...
like a chemical acid deal.
What do you think, Teeny?
I think you two are
a pair of potheads.
OK, you getting a whole one
of these or a half?
I'm getting that
right there.
OK, wonderful.
You didn't bring this
into the store with you?
No.
Then I'll go ahead
and charge you for it.
This is a hand lotion...
so don't put it on any
other part of your body...
even if that part
needs lubrication.
We try to keep frivolous
lawsuits to a minimum...
unless, of course,
the customer is at fault.
Do you
always wear makeup?
Oh, not very often.
Here's your change,
and fuck you very much.
Excuse me?
Thank you very much.
Good as new, I tell you.
Good as new.
Now, you might be
interested in purchasing
some of the products
that I used today...
Oh, I'm not buying
anything today.
That'd be a mistake.
These are bargain prices.
I didn't bring my purse.
I hate my job.
That makes two of us.
I hate everybody here.
I hate Gwen.
I don't know what the hell
she's so happy about.
I'm starting to understand
why maniacs go out there
and get shotguns and
shoot everybody to pieces.
Maybe you're a maniac.
Maybe so.
You know your lips
are real pouty, like a woman?
And your eyes
always look sad...
the way they droop
off to the side.
How old are you?
Uh, 22.
I'm an old lady next to you.
How old are you?
How old do you think?
I don't know.
I'm 30 years old.
How long you been
working here for?
Forever and a day.
You don't have a car?
I live down the street.
You can ride in here.
There's room.
Do you wanna come in?
I don't know.
I'm in a funk.
Well, I'm not
gonna beg you.
Well, I'm not
gonna beg you.
Man, On TV: You got to
go there in your head...
And I did, and things
changed for me.
I'll be in my room.
Mother: OK, Tom.
Man, On TV: I can look
over my shoulder...
figuratively speaking.
They call you Tom?
It's my slave name.
Holden's what I call myself.
This is my room.
Not a lot to look at.
What are your folks like?
They're OK.
They don't get me.
But they're all right.
They just...
My husband doesn't get me.
Since when do you
have a husband?
Since 7 years.
He's a painter.
What's he paint?
Houses.
He's a pig. He talks,
but he doesn't think.
I'm sick of it.
Did you go to college?
Um, I had to drop out
'cause I had a problem
with drinking and stuff...
but I'll go back.
I just got to...
prove to my folks
I can fy straight.
Did you go to college?
I was afraid
I'd lose Phil if I went.
Now it'd be
reason enough to go.
I was looking at you
in the store...
and I liked how
you kept to yourself.
I saw in your eyes
that you hate the world.
I hate it, too.
You know what
I'm talking about?
Justine: After living
in the dark for so long...
a glimpse of the light
can make you giddy.
Strange thoughts
come into your head...
and you better think 'em.
Has a special fate
been calling you
and you not listening?
Is there a secret message
right in front of you...
and you're not reading it?
Is this your last,
best chance?
Are you gonna take it?
Or are you
going to the grave
with unlived lives
in your veins?
Notifying your wife,
for instance.
What did I say?
If you had a wife.
What did I talk about?
I talked to Margaret.
She, uh, filled out a red dress.
What else?
Teeny, you're pretty.
Bubba, isn't Teeny pretty?
I seen better.
I seen worse.
No, that's why
I ain't never married.
You got yourself
the best fish in the sea.
I wonder what it'd
be like to be a woman.
All that smooth skin...
long hair.
If I was a woman,
I'd be a slut.
A lesbian slut.
Gwen says smoking marijuana
lowers your sperm.
Lowers it to where?
Maybe you're the infertile one
around here.
Maybe every time you smoke
a little doobie...
you're killing
our unborn children.
OK, close.
Why are you limpin'?
l... I twisted up my ankle
on the stairs.
Mm-hmm.
I was wondering maybe
you could give me a ride home.
Yeah, sure, OK.
All right, I'll talk to you
about it later.
Mm-hmm.
All I know is, every woman
should have one beau
before any woman has 2 beaus.
He's not my beau.
He's my friend.
Happy Halloween,
Retail Rodeo shoppers.
There's a Retail Rodeo special
on all bulk candy on aisle 4.
Ghouls and goblins,
witches and warlocks...
wandering these aisles
day after day...
I put a Halloween curse
on your hellish heads.
Good night, Corny.
Good night.
Happy Halloween.
Oh, I'm not a pagan,
but thanks all the same.
Which ankle
did you twist, Holden?
My left.
Hmm. Maybe you should
put some cold water on it
so it doesn't
swell up and infame.
OK.
You're a writer, so you have
yourself a goal, I guess.
I used to, you know...
lie in bed
and imagine other cities...
other jobs I could have...
other husbands.
Now I don't even know
what to imagine anymore.
Holden, I have a husband.
Thought you said he was a pig.
Well... Holden...
I don't want
to hurt anybody.
Phil: So I been thinking
about what you're saying
about my sperm being low.
I mean, I know
I got good sperm.
It's baby-making sperm,
but...
suppose it couldn't hurt
to have it confirmed
by an expert.
Oh, who gives a shit?
Who needs
a fucking baby, anyway?
You wanna make yourself
useful around here?
Why don't you get
that goddamn TV fixed?
What the hell?
It sounds like a helicopter
is landing in here.
You want a blackberry,
honey?
Man was selling 'em
on the road.
No, thank you.
They're real sweet.
This is for you.
It's from Holden.
Where is he?
He's got the day off.
He came by
this morning with it.
Thanks.
Don't mention it.
Hey, Gwen.
Hi, sugar.
Holden: DearJustine...
because of you,
I'll be quitting the Retail Rodeo.
The last 2 days have been
the most god-awful of my life.
I've not been able to get
rid of you in my head.
I've never wanted
anything so bad...
and I have wanted
many things.
I'd given up long ago
on being gotten by someone else...
and then you came along.
The idea that I could be gotten
because of circumstance
or never get got is the worst
feeling I've ever felt...
and I have felt
many bad feelings.
I'm sorry I can never
see you again, Justine.
Forgive me for being so weak,
but that is who I am.
Good-bye...
Holden Worther.
lf, for some reason...
you could change your mind
and want to be with me...
body and soul,
meet me after work.
I will be waiting
for you at 5 p.m.
outside Chuck E. Cheese.
If you are not there
at 5:00...
you will never see me again
in your lifetime.
Gwen.
Hmm.
What's wrong?
I'm OK.
I feel a little sick.
Man On TV:
Let's go. There he goes.
Man On TV:
What happened?
Second Man On TV:
There he goes.
Gwen?
Gwen?
Jack: Justine?
You're OK.
What's going on in here?
Jesus.
Gwen, you sick?
We got... We gotta get her
to a hospital.
Justine, you drive her
to Saint Catherine's.
Well, what time is it?
It's a quarter to 5:00.
Why, you gotta be somewhere?
Gwen.
Oh, I had a dream.
I had a dream I was sprouting
a beard made of bean sprouts.
Oh.
I'm gonna let you
off here, OK?
OK. You'll meet me inside?
Uh, well, yeah.
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna park the car...
and then I'll come in
and meet you in there.
OK. Thanks.
You're a doll.
- Hey!
- Ohh!
Oh, God, I'm really glad
you came.
I just ditched Gwen
at the hospital.
Oh, God, thank God.
Where are we going?
Let's go to my house.
No. With your folks there?
We'll just park somewhere.
Oh, this isn't well-planned.
Look, I don't know.
I don't care.
Wherever you want.
I just want to hold you.
Wherever you want.
I just want to hold you.
That's $45 even.
And I need you
to fill this out for me.
Stay here.
I can't do it.
We'll be back here
before you know it.
I don't want to.
I don't want to go.
Justine.
I'm yours.
I'm all yours.
Phil: Hey.
Hey.
Where you been?
Gwen got real sick today.
She was throwing up
all over the store.
I had to take her
to the hospital
and sat with her.
Did she sick up on you?
No.
Did she sick up
on anybody?
Ha ha ha ha.
It's not funny, Phil.
It's serious.
I'm gonna go by there
after work tomorrow, too.
And the next day.
Justine, what
happened to you?
What?
Went down
to Saint Catherine's
to check up on Gwen.
I looked all over for you.
She was asking for you.
How is she?
She was heaving up
until there was
nothing left to heave.
Doctor said she must've
eaten something
with some kind
of parasite in it...
some kind of bacteria.
I bet it was
those blackberries.
They're gonna
keep her in there
until she gets better, so...
you're gonna have to
supervise cosmetics.
Stop it.
Somebody's gonna see.
Who cares? I don't care.
I crave you.
I want to know everything
about you.
Who are you?
I'm just this woman.
I moved to Texas
when I was 1 1.
My daddy
was in the air force.
I wanna knock your head open
and see what's inside.
I've had so much pain
in my life.
I know you have, too.
I can see it.
Justine: Holden gave me two
of his stories to read.
It was more like the story
of what a story would be.
It was about a boy
who was put upon...
whose mother
is cold and selfish
and whose father wanted him
to play football.
Other people didn't get him,
especially girls.
Soon enough,
the boy comes to believe
that no one
can ever really know him.
He starts acting out...
drinking and taking all kinds
of drugs.
At the end,
the boy kills himself
by jumping over a bridge.
The second story
was pretty much the same
as the first...
except, at the end,
the boy kills himself
by drinking a bottle
of bug poison.
Your stories are intense.
I just want to leave
some kind of legacy.
Something great.
And after that, I don't
care what happens to me.
Don't say that.
I wish there was
a story about me.
I don't know who would
read it, though.
I would.
I like this.
I like having a secret.
You gave me a secret,
Holden.
See?
Now that you met me,
you're mysterious.
And dark and twisted.
I'm doomed to hell,
aren't I?
Yes, you are.
What is it?
That's Bubba's truck.
Get in the car.
Phil takes that truck
to work every day.
Bubba picks him up
and drops him off.
Why? Why would that truck
be parked there?
Well, I don't know.
If he finds out about us...
I won't let him hurt you.
He's big, Holden.
He'll kill you.
He'll beat me,
but he will kill you.
You can't worry about something
that hasn't even happened.
I gotta go
to the hospital.
All right.
Don't. I mean,
he could be following us.
Justine.
Poor lady.
She just passed.
What? Who did?
Gwen.
She passed away.
Wha... What do you mean?
I thought
she had a stomachache.
Well, she got worse...
and she was on
life support all day, and...
I don't understand.
It was God's will, Justine.
No one can understand it.
No point trying.
It was just
Gwen's time to...
fy away home.
Gwen died today.
What?
Are you kidding?
What for?
Parasite. Bacteria.
Something she ate.
Are you OK?
Where were you
this afternoon?
Painting on Bovary. Why?
What time did Bubba
bring you home?
Knocked off early,
about 4:00.
Bubba had a date
with a stewardess. Why?
I can't believe
she's dead.
I wasn't a very good friend
to her.
Aw, don't say that, Teeny.
Of course you were.
Of course you were.
Retail Rodeo employees...
this is Jack Field,
your store manager.
Before we open today...
I have some terrible
and shocking news.
One of our best employees,
Gwen Jackson...
died yesterday.
Gwen was a real class act.
She had a good attitude.
She had ideas.
And we're all
gonna miss her.
Now, if any of y'all need
to collect your thoughts
and remember Glen... Gwen...
ahem... then today's the day.
You'll be excused from work...
and we'll just have to
do without you.
Gwen, this one's for you.
Woman:
~ I'll be seeing you ~
~ In all the old,
familiar places ~
~ That this heart
of mine embraces ~
~ All day through ~
~ All day through ~
Justine:
Holden had the notion
to spend the day
at Gabler's Creek...
skinny-dipping
and making love.
He said
we'd be like Adam and Eve...
rolling
in the sticks and dirt
and being one
with the wilderness.
He was so fixed on the idea
that even when the clouds
were coming in
and the sky
was getting dark...
he kept on swimmin'.
All my thoughts
turned to death.
I thought of Gwen's body
rotting away.
I thought about
what a nice person she was...
so full of life
and goodwill.
If there is a heaven,
Gwen would be there...
giving makeovers
and offering up helpful advice.
I thought if I died today,
what would happen to me...
a hateful girl...
a selfish girl?
An adulteress.
A liar.
Oh.
What are we doing?
Making one out of two.
I haven't thought
this through.
Justine...
you leave him.
And go where?
With you on my arm...
my folks would think
I've changed...
and they'd stop thinking
I'm such a loner.
I have a girlfriend,
a pretty one...
who knows me and likes me,
and they'd be so happy
they'd give me money
to write my novel.
But where will we go?
It'll be like...
Catcher in the Rye...
but by me.
I'll be immortal, and then,
likeJ.D. Salinger...
I'll just vanish.
- Hey, Teeny.
We been up to no good.
Got the day off
on account of the rain.
I thought you might.
Man On TV:
What are you doing?
Say, I heard about your friend
being dead and all.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, she was
real healthy, too.
Well, at least you were
with her when she went.
Isn't that right? You were
with her when she went.
Yeah.
I wish it would rain
every day from here on out.
Never have to paint again.
Now, you have to make sure
you order the right ones
when you run out.
- Hey, Justine.
- Hi.
How you holding up?
Fine.
Real shocker.
I decided to move Cheryl
over to cosmetics.
She got a little
too creative on the P.A.
Maybe she'll watch
her Ps and Qs over here.
If she don't,
she's out on her butt.
Now you listen
toJustine, sister.
Do you want me to help you
get stuff out of storage?
Oh...
no. Maybe later?
All right. Well, are you going
to give me a ride home today?
My ankle sure is acting up.
I got to get home.
But maybe Cheryl can.
What?
You need a ride?
Forget it.
I think we got
to take a breather.
I'm nervous.
I feel guilty.
Well, can't we go
to the motel?
Not today.
Well, let's go
to the storeroom.
Just be patient, Holden.
Um, I was wondering
what time was that,
uh, Bible study?
It's tomorrow night
at 8:00.
We'd sure
love to have you.
Can I bring my husband?
Of course.
You know, the couple that
prays together stays together.
What's this?
The Holy Bible.
There's one for you
and one for me.
Not very light, is it?
We're going
to Bible study.
The couple
that prays together
stays together.
I heard it was
the couple that lays together
stays together.
Well, you heard wrong.
Cheryl...
do you think you could
take this one?
Sure.
Sit right down here, ma'am.
We're going
to make you pretty.
Now how do you
like your hair?
What? Are you going
to do my hair?
No, I just need to know
if that's your usual way
of wearing it...
all big and high.
If it is,
I'll just put more makeup
on your chin
to offset it.
You're going
to want to take
a whole bottle
of this home with you.
It's got quite a lot
of ingredients in it...
so you're getting
a good deal.
It's got
ginkgo extract in it.
Do you know what that is?
No.
It's extract
of the ginkgo...
and it makes
your skin real slick
so that any liquid
will roll right off you...
be it water,
or lemon juice, or urine.
I'll put it
in a bag for you.
Phil...
what are you doing?
what are you doing?
What?
We're going to be late
for Bible study.
You're stoned.
You got paint in your hair.
Would you get in
the shower, dummy?
I completely
didn't remember.
Ohh, get in the shower.
Working on
your spiritual life?
Yeah, I guess.
Ain't that
a hoot and a holler?
What do you mean?
I saw you, Justine.
You saw me what?
I saw you.
We got some things
to talk about...
you and me.
You come by my house
tomorrow after work...
if you know
what's good for you.
Hey...
where's Bubba?
He left.
Well, I'm ready.
Let's go.
I don't know what
to say aboutJesus.
I'm stoned.
Just let the other people
do the talking.
Oh, geez...
we forgot
the Bibles, Justine.
Well, that's all right,
they'll forgive us.
Howdy. Welcome.
Hey there, people.
Glad you could make it.
Hi, Corny.
This is my husband...
Phil.
Howdy, Phil.
Y'all are in for a treat.
We got a good discussion
planned for tonight.
If man is made
in God's image...
what does that
say about God?
Yeah, that sounds
like a good one, man.
Hey, Brandon,
I want to talk to you
about the casting of
Pilgrim's Progress.
Phil, come
with me to the car.
What?
Come with me to the car.
I got to get something.
What are you doing?
Get in the car.
Just get
in the car, Phil.
What the hell?
I don't want
to go to Bible study.
Why not?
Because I don't want to.
Now let's just
get out of here.
Justine,
this is embarrassing.
We're running away
from Bible study
like a couple of
devil worshipers.
I don't care.
I'm not in the mood.
You are
freaking me out, man.
Why?
Why?
Because we forgot
our Bibles is why.
You just said 2 seconds ago
they'd forgive us.
Well, they may not,
all right?
So can we please just
get the shit out of here?
All right.
I'm never going back
to Bible study again.
I can tell you that much.
I don't care.
Fine by me. Let's just go.
Woman: I look too white,
don't you think?
Not at all. I'm just trying
to match your face with your hair.
I was thinking
you're not white enough.
I think I look
kind of weird.
The first rule of fashion
is you have to look weird.
What I'm doing has come
straight here from France.
Oh?
It's called Cirque du Face...
meaning
"Circus of the Face,"
and it's all the rage
with the Frenchies, ma'am.
Well, you're
the professional.
That's right...
and you're in good hands.
Corny: Justine,
what happened to you?
I looked over,
and I saw you two driving off
like vampires in the night.
Oh, gee...
we... we forgot our Bibles.
Well, you could have just
looked on with your neighbor.
It's a church, you know.
You can't make water without
bumping your nut on a Bible.
Well, we felt bad.
What in blazes?
Do you like it?
I can't go.
What?
I can't go today.
There's something important
that I have to tend to.
I thought you said
we'd go today.
Yeah, something came up.
Well, what?
What came up?
OK, look, uh...
I think, um, maybe...
somebody has found out about us.
Well, I'm starting to wonder
if you even want to go.
I'm starting to think
you don't get me.
Maybe I don't get you.
You do! You do get me!
You just don't
want to get me...
because I'm
too intensified for you.
Justine, who cares...
Who cares
if someone found out?
Look, we don't have to
live like this, Justine.
I know what it's like
to go home every night
and feel like
you're hiding out.
We can leave
all this behind.
That's easy for you
to say, Holden.
You are not married.
Are you just
going to give up?
You going to go
crawling back?
Holden, you are going
to get us caught!
You're so
fucking frightened...
it makes me sick.
Wait...
don't give up on us.
I won't.
OK.
OK.
I'll see you
tomorrow, OK?
OK?
OK.
Good luck on
your important thing.
Thanks.
Easy, Bits. Easy, Bits.
Back in your corner!
Back in your corner!
Back in your corner, Bits!
Come on in.
I want
to show you something.
Sit.
You get in your corner!
Get in your corner!
I mean it!
In your corner!
In your corner!
I'm in shock.
Why?
You know why.
Justine:
Bubba sat like that
for what seemed like 1 0 years
before he began to speak.
Finally,
when he opened his mouth...
he talked a blue streak
about the sad ruin
that was his life.
He talked about
how he loved Phil...
and how he loved me...
and how he always wanted
a girlfriend just like me
and to be a guy like Phil
and to be a guy like Phil
to this imaginary girl
like me who he never found.
Then he started on about
giving up your dreams
and how it's all a part
of getting older.
Bubba had given up
his dream of being Phil.
He had accepted his fate
of being Bubba...
always and forever.
Then last week...
a door that had
always been shut
swung wide open.
Bubba felt that this
was no chance coincidence.
A cosmic force was at work.
The sounds of me making love
to a man who wasn't Phil
was like
a shout in Bubba's ear
from the Creator himself.
What it meant,
or what to do or why...
Bubba didn't know.
All he knew
was that he hated me
for poisoning
the well of idealism
from which he had drunk
for so long.
I was no longer Bubba's image
of perfection.
I was just
a liar and a whore...
and that sickened him.
But on the other hand...
he loved me
for opening his eyes
and releasing him from
the bitter chains of envy
that bound him to Phil.
Phil was no Superman...
just a cuckold and a fool...
and that was beautiful.
Bubba felt that there was
just one thing
left for us to do...
something that would
solve both of our problems
and end
this whole tragic saga.
Bubba, I'm not going
to sleep with you.
But don't you see?
This is my chance
for liberation.
But one person's...
But one person's...
you know, liberation...
is another person's badness.
There's just no way.
I'm going to have
to tell Phil then.
Why?
He's my best friend.
I can't
keep him in the dark
about something this big.
He's a cuckold.
But you want
to cuckold him yourself.
That's different.
That's not about him.
That's about my salvation.
Look, you've got
your choice to make...
Destroy your marriage
and break
your husband's heart...
or have sex with me
right now.
In your corner, Bits!
Down! In your corner!
Justine! Justine! Justine!
Oh! God!
What?
There was someone
at that window.
Did you not see?
Oh, you're paranoid.
I got to go.
Phil is never
going to find out
about any of this.
Don't fret.
Just get this damn dog
away from me.
You're looking at
a free man, Justine.
A free man.
Great. Good for you.
Thank you.
Bits!
Bits! Bits!
TV: . . The children.
All the tales
of mystical places
began with
"once upon a time..."
I'm nervous.
You're nervous? Why?
Because I got to go
to that doctor tomorrow
and jism into a cup,
that's why.
What if I can't do it?
You can do it.
You know, if you
said you'd help me...
I'd feel
a lot less nervous.
It's going to be on
your lunch hour anyway.
OK.
You didn't even
say nothing
about the TV
being fixed.
Oh. Is it?
Thanks.
You're welcome.
Well, aren't you
a fright?
Justine, have you
heard from Holden?
He didn't show up
for work today.
I want to know
what gives.
I know you two
are friends.
We're not friends.
You eat lunch
together every day.
No, we don't.
Well, if you see him...
tell him Jack Field's
looking for him.
Oh, my God!
What are you doing?
You're a hooker.
You hooker!
I saw you.
You followed me.
So how many guys
you gettin' with?
You gettin' with
every guy in the state?
No! Holden, this is
all because of you!
He had me
over a barrel.
If I didn't
sleep with him...
he was going to tell
Phil about us.
I'm so alone!
You've got
to get ahold of yourself.
Oh!
Are you drunk?
Yes, I'm drunk!
And I'll be drunk every day
until the day I die!
What do you care?
You'll jump on any pecker
that's put in front of you!
It's not
what you think.
I saw everything!
Oh, God! Oh, my God!
OK, go home, sober up...
meet me after work...
and we will
talk about this.
Where are you going?
I got to help Phil
with his sperm.
What?
Just go!
- Go on!
- Wait.
I can't share you, Justine!
Maybe with one man...
but not with
a whole bunch of them!
Oh, great.
Nurse: Mr. Last,
would you come with me?
Wish me luck.
Good luck, honey.
Knock 'em dead, partner.
You look nice.
No, I don't.
I know you're angry,
and I can figure why...
but from where I stand...
what happened yesterday
was a wonderful thing.
Nothing happened yesterday,
so drop it.
Well, I'm awful grateful
to you, Justine. I am.
Bubba, I mean it.
Let me just
ask you one thing.
How do I stack up
against Phil...
you know?
How do I stack up
against him where it counts?
Ma'am?
Your husband has made
a request for your presence.
Who's that?
It's Justine.
Come on.
I can't do this on my own.
I need help.
What? You've never
done it on your own?
Not in a place like this.
Not when I have to
hand over the results.
Just...
let me hold your boob.
Here.
Ow! They're sore.
What's wrong with you?
You look like death.
My stomach's cramping.
I feel sore.
Is it your period?
No, it's just stress.
I know,
this job's stressful.
I'm breaking out.
You're breaking out
because you put so much makeup
on your face.
Maybe you're pregnant.
What?
No.
You know, sometimes
I think to myself...
"At least it can't
get any worse."
But it can.
It could get worse.
As long as you can say
you hit rock bottom...
you haven't.
Oh, my God...
blackberries.
A blind man could go deaf...
a widow could
lose her children...
babies starve
and they never get food.
They never get any food!
They just come into the world
and they die.
Holden, calm down,
all right?
I can't calm down!
It'd be easy if
I was a hooker like you...
then I could calm down
all over town.
Hey!
I am not a hooker!
l... I know you're not.
I'm in agony.
Why?
What do you mean why?
I thought you hated your life.
I do. I mean,
I'm depressed, but...
but you are
really depressed.
I'll kill him.
I'll murder him in his sleep.
I'll kill my parents,
I'll steal their money...
whatever it takes...
just... just whatever you want.
Just as long as
it's you and me.
Please don't
forsake me, Justine.
OK.
I can't take it!
All right, I won't.
I won't, I promise.
I won't.
I promise, OK?
Justine: I realized then
that Holden was at best,
a child...
and at worst, a demon.
If I was ever
going to go straight...
I'd have to ditch him.
Sometimes to get back
on the road to redemption...
you have to make
a few pit stops.
How much are
the blackberries?
Ah, a tin for $2.00, miss.
Here you go.
Thank you.
Have a blackberry.
We... We need a plan.
We can't keep
living day-to-day.
We got to chart a course,
and we just got to stick...
Have a blackberry,
Holden!
They're... They're dirty.
They're sweet.
If I could only get
my hands on some money.
If someone could just
tell me the answer.
I got to do...
But I never do anything...
'cause I end up
thinking about it instead.
I got to do.
But do what...
Whoa. What?
What was that for?
They looked dirty.
They... like... I saw a bug
in them or something.
Son, I understood
your history.
Your father gave me a call,
I gave you a job.
I even let you
use that name...
even though
it isn't yours...
and I never do that
with other people
in the store, so...
I'm worried
about Holden... Tom.
I'm... I'm
worried about Tom.
I just befriended
Tom recently...
and now...
well...
I think
he's mentally ill.
He's got this idea
in his head
that we've had
some sort of affair...
which is crazy...
because
I'm... I'm married...
And... And he said...
He's been saying
all sorts of strange things
and making threats...
and drinkin'...
and...
and I just think
he would be better off
someplace where people...
professionals...
could take care of him.
Otherwise, l... l... l...
He's going to get
himself into trouble.
What are you
doing in there?
What's that?
It's a home pregnancy test.
Why are you taking it?
Because I still haven't
gotten my period.
What's it say?
Well, I haven't
taken it yet.
Could you give me
a minute, please?
I want to be here
when you find out, Teeny.
OK.
The little plastic
doohickey's turning blue.
What's that mean?
Blue?
Bright blue.
That means I'm pregnant.
All right!
Phil: I knew it.
Waste of time going
to that sperm doctor.
We did it!
We're going to have
ourselves a baby.
Maybe.
Tomorrow...
we're going to celebrate
at Senor Tuna.
Yes, we are.
And I'm going
to bring Bubba...
you can bring some of your
friends from work, or...
the Bible-study guy...
whoever.
Too bad Gwen's dead.
The test
could be wrong, Phil.
It's a little early
to be having a party.
Well, let's do it
mellow then.
You sure don't
seem too excited.
Oh, I'm excited.
It's just...
you know, a lot of worries
come along with having a baby.
Now don't think negative.
Think positive.
We could have ourselves
a tiny Phil...
or a tiny Teeny.
Teeny's going to have
a teeny-weeny Teeny.
You think anything's
going to change...
having a baby?
What do you mean?
Everything's
going to change.
Yeah, but I mean...
do you think anything's
really going to change?
What do you mean?
Woman On TV: Gentlemen?
Man: Morning.
We found these
out in the road.
Belonged to a fellow
named of Burt Evans.
Man: Tell us
about everything.
Hello?
Woman: Hi.
This is Dr. Williams
returning the call
ofJean Worther.
I'm calling from
the Halin County
Psychiatric Hospital.
Who was it, Tom?
It was a wrong number.
Either of you
seen Holden?
That boy
is out on his ass!
Justine,
something's going on.
Something is
definitely happening.
OK, go find out.
What? What is it?
What's happening?
It's big.
What?
It's very big.
Cheryl, come on.
I'm gonna kill you.
Somebody stole $1 5,000
from the safe.
Yeah. They blew the thing
open with a gun.
Oh, my God.
Not only that...
but the cops
know who did it.
Who?
Somebody who works here.
Oh, Cheryl!
Holden... Holden did it.
Fool left his cashier key
in the door.
Oh, my God.
They can't find him,
though.
They say he robbed
his folks, too...
Took off.
You in on it?
What?!
No.
I know you two played hooky
in the storeroom.
I'll never rat on you.
I done some things myself.
Just tell me...
you in on it?
I don't know what
you're talking about.
Suit yourself.
Justine...
can we talk to you
for a second?
Jack: Come in.
Hi, Justine.
Go ahead
and have a seat.
Justine,
you like working
at the Retail Rodeo,
don't you?
You like the company...
and you like
the people?
You wouldn't want
to jeopardize all that
by making some silly
error in judgment...
would you?
Holden stole $1 5,000
from the safe last night.
Did you have anything
to do with it?
No.
I don't know anything.
'Cause we know you're
very tight with Holden.
I hardly know him.
I've seen you
in the storeroom
with him, Justine...
on many an occasion.
I think you know him
pretty well.
I don't know anything.
Holden: Justine!
Justine!
Justine!
I did it.
I finally did something.
The police are
looking for you.
Oh, who cares?
I'm proud of myself.
Fuck them.
Fuck all of'em.
Hey! They think that
I'm in on it, too, OK?
Corny has got a camera
in that storage room.
That Bible-thumping pervert
has been watching us
the whole time.
Well, we're out of here!
Justine... God.
I got over $20,000.
I got a gun. What else?
Oh, God,
I'm getting all goosey.
I think
I'm gonna crash.
I'm pregnant, Holden.
It's my baby.
Not necessarily.
Yes, it is.
You know it is.
Even if it is...
you cannot raise
a baby on the run.
Yes, you can.
I mean, you can't
raise a baby here.
You know that.
Justine.
You hate your husband.
You hate your job.
You love me, let's go.
I can't go tonight.
I gotta pack my things...
and I'd have
to get more money.
Well, then tomorrow.
I'll go to the motel,
and I'll wait for you.
Just be there by noon.
Oh, this is just
all going too fast.
Justine,
what do you have to lose?
Nothing.
Well,
then be there by noon.
OK.
I love you, Justine.
This is all
gonna work out.
I know it.
Oh, geez, wait.
I almost forgot.
Here's a story
of your life.
You inspired me.
Phil: Hey, Teeny.
Hey.
Getting worried about you.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Justine,
this is Floberta.
Floberta,
this is Justine.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Congratulations
on your expectation.
Thanks.
Well, you think
it's a girl or a boy?
It don't make
no difference
as long as it
plays quarterback
for the Cowboys.
Well, I hear
Senor Tuna calling.
Yello.
Yeah.
Well, it's not right.
What is that
supposed to mean?
Hey, look... No.
You... No, you look.
You... You don't know shit, OK?
Justine's pregnant.
You got that?
Yeah, well, look...
you better check
your records again, pal...
then you call me.
Dumb doctor says
my sperm's no good.
Does that mean
Justine's not pregnant?
No.
It just means
they messed up, is all.
They don't know
everything.
They just got it wrong,
is all.
It looks like
that wind's
picking up again.
Justine: How it all came down
to this, only the devil knows.
Retail Rodeo was
at the corner on my left.
The motel was
down the road to my right.
I closed my eyes
and tried to peer
into the future.
On my left,
I saw days upon days
of lipstick
and ticking clocks...
dirty looks
and quiet whisperings.
And burning secrets
that just won't ever
die away.
And on my right,
what could I picture?
The blue sky,
the desert earth...
stretching out into
the eerie infinity...
a beautiful,
never-ending nothing.
Hey, Justine.
I know where
you can find him.
Jack: Holden?
He's at
the Motel Glen Capri...
and he'll be there
till noon.
You done good.
You're a good girl.
Hey.
Hey.
What's going on
in the bedroom?
Looks like
a twister hit it.
Oh, yeah, I was, uh...
I was doing laundry.
I thought we'd been robbed.
TV: A spokesperson
from the sheriff's office
will be joining me.
Why aren't you at work?
They gave me the day off.
This is Ken Rudolph reporting
from the Glen Capri Motel
where a standoff between
police and a local man
has just ended in bloodshed.
Police had been given a tip
that a man suspected
of burglarizing
a local Retail Rodeo
discount store
had been staying
at the motel.
had been staying
at the motel.
The man was
a Retail Rodeo employee
named Thomas Worther.
Worther allegedly began
brandishing a handgun.
He then fired one shot,
taking his own life.
Inside the motel room...
police say they found
$1 5,000 and a handgun...
Phil: Oh, man.
Retail Rodeo...
You know that guy?
TV: Thomas Worther
was 22 years old.
Mm.
That is all the information
we have at this time.
Of course,
details are rather sketchy.
We'll continue to monitor
the situation...
...a spokesperson
from the sheriff's office
will be joining me
in a few moments with an update.
But for now, I can tell you
what we know.
Attention,
Retail Rodeo employees...
this is Jack Field,
your store manager.
As most of y'all
know by now...
we lost another employee
yesterday.
Holden was a thief
and a disturbed young man...
and what happened
was a sad thing.
Perhaps we can learn a lesson
from this tragedy...
like don't steal
and don't be disturbed.
The important thing
is to move on.
Life does, and so should we.
This one's for you, Holden.
Woman:
~ Who's sorry now? ~
~ Ooh-ooh ~
~ Who's sorry now? ~
I thought we were
gonna get a day
to grieve
and go to the movies.
~ Whose heart is aching? ~
Justine: What?
What is it?
I was just at your house,
and the mail came...
and Phil was opening letters.
And he opened this bill
from a credit card company.
And, fuck...
please don't tell him
about us, Justine.
Please. Please.
I love Phil.
I love him
more than myself.
Please have mercy on me.
Justine: Hey, Phil.
Have you been
sleeping around
behind my back?
What?
I said, have you
been sleeping around
behind my back?
Yes.
Why?
Why?
I don't know why.
Don't you love me?
Don't you love me
at all?
Yes.
You're the only
man alive
that I love.
Oh, God,
please don't tell me
it's not my baby.
It's your baby.
Are you sure?
It is. I swear.
I swear to God.
Who was he?
Oh, that doesn't matter.
Yeah, it does.
Was it someone from work?
Yeah, I know who it was.
It was that
Bible-study guy...
wasn't it?
That Nazarene.
That's why you're
acting so spooked.
Yeah. It was him.
I'm gonna beat his ass.
Phil, don't.
Ah, you're getting
all swollen.
I'm sorry
I hit you, baby.
I'm sorry, Phil.
I need to get stoned.
OK.
Get stoned.
I just gotta escape,
you know?
Yeah.
Do you ever
feel like that...
like you gotta escape?
Yeah.
Yeah, I do.
What are those?
Fake eyelashes,
extra long.
J-Just do it
normal for once.
You want me to make
the other cheek purple
to even it out?
No.
Cheryl: Did you
hear about Corny?
He was going home
after Bible study
last night...
and 2 beefy guys
with painted faces
pulled up in a truck
and jumped him.
That's terrible.
Yeah.
Justine:
That day, I read the story
Holden wrote for me.
It was kind of different
from the other ones
but kind of the same.
It was about a girl
who was put upon...
whose job
is like a prison
and whose life
has lost all meaning.
Other people
don't get her...
...new places
all the time.
especially her husband.
One day she meets a boy
who's also put upon...
and they fall in love.
After spending
their whole lives
never getting got...
with one look...
they get each other
completely.
That's my big baby.
In the end,
the girl and the boy
run away together
into the wilderness...
never to be heard from again.
