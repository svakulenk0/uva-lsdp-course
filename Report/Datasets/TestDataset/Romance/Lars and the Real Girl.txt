I'm inviting you to breakfast.
I can not, I have to go to the church.
Well, after the church then?
Come on, we have not seen
you for so long.
Take this, I do not want
Your little baby geat a sick.
It is so cold out.
Come on.
-- OK.
Will you come?
Oh yeah.
Great.
Could you put that whole thing on...?
-- Oh yeah.
You owe me five dollars.
Until I see him at the table appear,
I owed nothing.
There is something going on with him.
I am worried.
You keep saying that, I ...
Think that there are other things
To contribute.
But in this world there is
Really only one love.
We never have to ask:
'Lord, what should I do'?
Because the Lord has told us
What we should do.
.
The blessing of our Lord Jesus Christ,
The love of God ...
The fellowship of the Holy Ziel,
Will now and forever with you.
I think you can use some help.
-- Thank you, dear.
I moved it to the hospital.
You are a great guy, Lars.
Where is your girlfriend?
That I did not.
-- Are you a gay? -- No.
My grandson is a gay.
I know several gay.
That, I know, but I am
Not gay, so ...
Let it not so long,
That is not good for you.
Here.
Give this to begin,
A nice person.
Hello, Lars.
I see you tomorrow at work.
-- Yeah, well.
My brother is twenty-seven,
Maybe he wants to be left alone.
That plan is not.
-- Seriously ...
Ga.
How do you know that?
-- Because ...
People are not.
That's what he says.
Come on, you promised.
Is this normal?
-- Five dollar.
Good morning.
-- Good morning, Cindy.
Do you have a nice weekend?
This new girl is fun, huh?
You and Margo? What do you think of it?
Lars, you have to see this.
I am not really this morning
In the mood for porn.
It is not porn.
Well, that's it.
But come take a look.
Do you like this?
This is a solid body. If they
Weighs 125 pounds, it weighs 125 pounds.
You can be everything to your liking,
You have all these different heads ...
And parts. You can design your own wife.
They are anatomically correct.
It is not a buy?
That I would.
Look how much they cost.
I have nothing more, after my new Xbox.
Good morning.
Good morning.
-- Hello, good morning.
Everyone, Margo is here. Hooray.
Can you do that thing to do?
I was thinking. We are the only ones in
Come from the lake, we can car-pooling.
Lars, it's your day at coffee
To retrieve, buddy.
Yes.
You know what your problem is, Margo?
You are too aggressive.
Put a little calmer.
Keep your head.
Mostly cloudy later in the evening
Snow .
Wait, stop.
Karin, what?
We wish that you will eat.
Do you?
You have let me scared.
Sweetheart, excuse me.
Wait.
I can not.
-- Why not?
Why not?
Lars Come on, we miss you.
I work back home,
So I have to ... otherwise I come in difficulty.
You did not.
-- That is my phone, I think.
Come on, wait.
Lars, stop.
Come on, please?
-- I have other plans.
I can not.
There is salmon, and kersentaart.
Would you please let me go?
-- No.
Is that all you can eat?
-- Yes, it was delicious. Thank you.
No, you keep it.
It's my turn.
And what talk, please.
Karin is worried about you,
They think you have a problem ...
Because you spend so much time alone,.
Everything is fine with me.
-- That I said it.
That is exactly what I said.
Papa was also a bit so, so ...
Yes, but he wanted no one around them
. So that's a difference.
That is not true.
Yes, of course, maybe after
Mum died, but ...
That you knew him, so ...
That could you not, but I
Just say ...
Karin and I would be very grateful,
If you would come and live with us.
That does not, thank you.
-- The house is for half of you.
Yes, I know.
But everything is fine with me, thanks.
I put only on the table.
Good night. Sleep good.
-- Good night.
Wait. Here are some leftovers for you.
Do you have my blanket?
Yes, that is ...
-- I grab it, even like this.
I am so back.
It is a beautiful blanket.
Gus says that your mother
Made for you.
When she was pregnant.
They need a lot of your account.
Just as we do.
Are you angry with me?
-- Does he have?
Please. Good night.
-- Thanks. Good night.
Six weeks later
Hello?
-- Hello, Lars. You speak with Karin .
There is a large box just for you.
It is in the garage.
Okay, thanks.
Thanks.
This is a beautiful sweater.
Come inside.
It is good. Can Karin
Even to the door?
Sweetheart, get even.
Lars is there.
Really?
-- Yes.
It does ...
Yoga for pregnant women.
This is good stuff.
What is happening?
I have a guest.
You have a ...?
A score?
That's great.
And she is not here in the neighborhood.
-- They?
What should you say to me. Where ...
Where did you meet?
On the Internet.
-- Nowadays everybody does that.
That's great.
She speaks little English only.
That is not bad. That is the same as
The people on my work. That is not bad.
She is in a wheelchair, so I want
Not that they are there rot by feel.
And I want to ask you something, I know
It is a very big favor.
She is very religious, and because we
Both still young ...
And single. So it is not good for
Us alone together in the garage.
They may be in the pink room.
-- They can sleep.
In the pink room?
-- Yes, of course.
And there are new towels.
Give us half an hour,
Something in the oven to stop ...
Then we make the place ready.
Let's begin.
That is ...
You silent figures,
You know what they say ...
It's great.
I see you like this.
Bianca is a missionary.
Was a missionary. I am sorry.
Because they were growing up
By nuns.
But now she is on leave so that they
The world can experience. Is that not too crazy?
She is shy.
That is you.
Everything is still so new.
For her, right?
Are you hungry?
-- We are starved.
Gus, do you want to help me even in the kitchen?
That was that.
I know.
He is crazy, right?
What should we do?
-- I do not know.
We need to call the hospital,
I think.
The hospital I can not afford ...
I can not believe it.
My little brother is certifiably crazy.
Control you.
Gus, quietly.
He speaks with a pop.
We meet here on this or
Or through other means, right?
I do not know what I should do.
-- I know it does not.
You must remain calm.
I am sorry.
-- It is good.
Karin, she is not eating.
You will never believe this ...
It makes me so angry.
Bianca comes from the tropics ...
It is a Brazilian ...
Half Brazilian, half Danish, that's right ...
Someone has stolen her luggage.
Yes, and they have stolen her wheelchair.
That's terrible.
Yes. Can you believe that, Gus?
Yes, I can believe it.
-- Good.
It makes me angry.
Anyway ...
I want you to ask a favor.
She believes that is not bad, I promise you.
Karin, do you think it is not really for Bianca
What clothes to borrow. She has nothing.
Would you do that?
I do not know whether we taste the same, Lars.
That is not very Karin, because Bianca
Not much does ...
For that kind of superficial things.
So that's not a problem.
Sure.
See you. I told you al
Thanks.
This is the room of my mother.
If you need something, Gus and Karin
Are in the front hall.
I am in the garage.
But you know it.
Even something else?
You have brand new towels,
Karin thanks.
Lars, I think we go to bed
Should go.
Not quite even.
I just wanted to say that I am so happy,
That you are finally here.
Lars, I think we now ...
Good night.
Wait, Gus had a good idea.
He is concerned about Bianca's health.
Just with that travel, and
Changing climate and everything ...
Stress, you know?
I make an appointment with Dr. Birnman
For tomorrow. Tomorrow early.
That we all.
-- Yes, you reminds you Dagmar is there?
Do you think it is a good idea.
-- I think we should do.
Yes, that's a good idea. I would indeed
Still go to a wheelchair.
Good night.
-- Good night.
I can see you tomorrow.
True pop.
Where they were forced to
The Russian mafia to strip .
Now she wants only one American man
Worth Loving .
Nadori, a job well
In Tokyo specified ...
.
Tammy is gone from school,
To the rodeo to come.
Are you the right to cowboy
This wild foal to tame .
The doctor will tell us
What we should do.
But it is a huisdokter.
We have a psychiatrist.
No, that's it.
She is also a psychologist.
She says that they have to,
Extent in the north.
What will the people think?
Since we can not worry
To make.
Right.
Since my father worked.
Our father.
That is the library. I have a map,
That you can borrow if you like.
I must actually address
But you can tell which.
I really do not know, Gus ...
What does dad really
Always done?
Water and energy.
I work in education.
I miss everybody, but there is at home
So much to do.
I will be back, as the old baby
Enough and you ...
Yes, of course. 'Readers Digest'.
'West Living', or 'Country'.
That I should also say.
She has low blood pressure.
Is that serious?
-- That could be.
We must wait and see.
It is good, mine
Probably low.
I want to see her every week you here
Brings, for a special treatment.
Can you do that?
Yes, you certainly know that it
Necessary?
Yes.
-- Good.
What do you think?
If she says that we should do.
You can make an appointment by Jo-Anne,
At the bar.
I would be delighted to see
To teach you know, Bianca.
I tell you that he is in a hospital
Belong.
No. My uncle Gart is,
And he has never returned.
But he has more help than
You and I can give him.
I have told you that something is not
OK, but you did not want to listen.
Do you mind?
Does Lars? Is he to his work,
Wash himself, dresses himself?
So far, yes.
Has he violent attacks?
-- No, never.
It is a dear.
He never even raises his voice.
We need him back refurbishment.
-- Can you refurbishment him?
I do not know, Gus.
I do not think that he is psychotic
Or schizophrenic.
I do not think that this is by genes
Caused, or a short circuit in the brains.
What's damn then on?
He appears to have a waanvoorstelling.
-- A waanvoorstelling?
What does he godsnaam
With a waanvoorstelling.
We should look forward to search.
The probability is that he's been a while to
The decompenseren.
I think we hear that
Not achieved.
Are there changes the last year
In the family?
No, everything is about the same,
Except that Karin is pregnant and ...
Lars that crazy.
You know, that does not necessarily
Just something to be ...
What we call disease of the mind,
Is not always a disease ...
It can be a way of communicating,
A way of solving something.
Fantastic. When will
Taking?
When he no longer needs.
How can we help?
Go there.
-- No.
Do or she really is?
I can not, I do not.
It is real.
It is beyond.
-- That I snap ...
I do not.
You will find him not mind
Subject to change.
Bianca is in the city for a reason.
-- But ...
It is not really a choice.
Then we do it.
Everything but necessary.
Yes, and everyone will uitlachen him.
And you
She loves children.
Even as coffee, Lars?
-- Yes, please.
May I see your funny face?
Wil Bianca also what?
Yes.
Please.
-- Thank you very much, Karin.
Gus not?
Sure.
Do you not to your work today, Gus?
I am not so good.
Maybe you can help Bianca,
She has a verpleegstersopleiding.
No, she has not, she has
No verpleegstersopleiding Lars,
Because they are not human beings.
It is a big plastic thing.
Since I am struck by.
Have you heard?
Bianca said that God made her why
. In order to help people.
Are you not too late in your work?
I come too late.
Well, I have to go.
I will notify me.
You have reached the number of my work, Karin?
-- Yes.
I wanted to tell you that you
Look very nice today.
I hope that you feel more comfortable, Gus.
I hope so too.
-- Thanks for breakfast.
I must go.
-- See you later.
I had to try.
What?
It's just ...
I do not know.
It is true. We are very
With ourselves busy, Gus.
That is not my fault.
It is not my fault.
Come on, Bianca.
We are going to consult some calls.
Good morning, Cindy.
You look nice today.
Thank you, Hr. Heula ...
It is well in advance, but you know how
I am excited that things can be.
Where are they, I know that you have caught them.
I did not. -- Yes.
This is revenge. -- What?
-- The fake thing in your la.
That.
-- Lars, I miss three of my action figures.
It's your turn to get coffee.
Listen Margo, who actiefiguren
Are very important to me ...
They are worth a lot of money, and if I do
All that fast on my desk think ...
Then you can go against your teddy bear
Saying that he should.
I will put them back, one by one.
Go thou to Cindy's party?
No.
I hoped that you would come.
I would like you also came.
Maybe.
That would be great.
Do you think my girlfriend
Can bring?
Yes, I am also someone.
I did not know that there are such dolls existed.
-- They call them liefdespoppen.
I saw that special in 'People'.
-- Really? Bianca has a ...
She is one of the girls.
I am sorry.
Really.
Have a sister?
I wish I had a wife
Who could not talk.
That is not so funny.
We want nothing to do with her
. She is a 'golden calf'.
We all know what has happened thus.
-- He does not worship her,
He is only with her?
-- These young people have no willpower.
He is sick.
We were hoping if we came to you
That you have been able to help ...
Obsežnim the road a bit.
If you could try to understand.
We can try.
In earth, which is now
The high point.
Sally, your cousin draws his cats
Dresses.
Hazel, your cousin gave all his money
To a UFO club.
Ernie, everyone knows that you
First wife was a kleptomaan.
That she was not.
-- Why is it then buried ...
With a couple of my earrings.
It is enough.
Those things happen.
Lars is a good boy.
You can count on me.
Thank you Mrs. Gruner.
He takes her not more
To the church, or Reverend Bock?
The question is, as always ...
What would Jesus do?
I would like to take this opportunity
Like to take this ...
To browse all the new visitors
Today to welcome in our church.
Bianca, nice to see you.
-- Lars, God bless you.
Thank you, Reverend.
These are for you, Bianca.
This is my girlfriend, Ga. Gruner.
She has a beautiful figure.
They are not really here, which
Always remain. Fun, huh?
Come here.
Watch out.
I Remove the seat.
Can you her belt driving?
Bianca, Gus makes your belt.
Can you do that on her legs, otherwise
They get cold. Thank you.
Thank you very much, Gus.
Where do you go?
One moment.
They do not know, it's a secret.
I can tell you however.
They always ask me anything, and they
Wants to know anything from me, so ...
I thought I could take her
To the lake.
What we always played.
Remind you you know?
-- Yes.
That sounds fun.
I must go.
I come out.
Why you cry?
Gus and his friends came
Here always.
They were here to fish.
Another time they went hockeyen.
Whether they built all
The nice cabins.
This is the tree,
A rope to swing.
And the ladder.
Mental Illness waanvoorstelling
You would have to see me chopping wood.
I am really good at it.
I am sorry.
I could no longer wait, I wanted
See how it went with her.
After treatment they must rest.
The work not, as they do not rust.
Keep me company, Lars.
Keep me company.
Do you know how many treatments
They still need?
No, I do not know.
It is a difficult disease, Lars.
But what I can use
A complete background of her.
As parents ...
-- Die died when she was a baby.
That is not fair.
-- Yes, but ...
They have no compassion for himself,
They would just ...
That it is normal.
That everyone treats her normal.
That's nice.
That I admire.
Yes, I too.
Is that your husband?
Yes, he is deceased.
No right? That I am sorry.
Do you have children?
-- No.
You must feel very lonely.
Sometimes I am so lonely that I forget what
Day it is, and how I should name games.
How about with you?
You are funny.
What is the difference between a waanvoor -
Assertion in a hallucination?
It is a false perception,
Compared with a false assumption.
So if Mous believe that the FBI
Aanzit behind him ...
The DEA.
-- The INS.
The IRS, ATF, the AAA.
-- That would be a waanvoorstelling.
Guy, who sit behind us.
That said I would like al ..
Already three times that wood warms you.
Therefore, I am in pieces heels.
What do we do? Why are we doing this for him?
-- Come on.
This is funny.
Is that true?
I do not know. Maybe not.
Tell me something about Karin.
I know its not so good.
It's great.
Gus and I are both happy with
Women. It's great.
But they ...
We do not need to talk.
I am looking for something to read for you.
No, it's just ...
Between us.
-- Sure.
I am concerned about her.
I think she has a small glitch.
Maybe you should not tell me.
-- No, that's just fine. It is only ...
I think because it is uncertain, but ...
She always tries to embrace everyone.
Are you? Some people do not.
Some people do not want to be embraced.
But realize that they are not.
She draws it personally.
And things ...
That hurt her.
I do not know what I should do.
Do you know that?
But it is sometimes as a consolation.
Just someone his arms around you
Having. Think you not?
No.
-- Come on, it feels good.
That does not feel good.
That hurts.
If a cut or a bruise?
If a burn.
As you go out, and ...
That your feet freeze and you go back
Indoors and they thawing weather, something.
It is almost exactly true.
Feels that all true?
By Bianca not.
But everyone else does.
So you let the people you do not touch.
Lars, it is not difficult to
Since it away?
I am not like you, because
I have all these layers.
That helps.
-- Listen ...
Karin we can not change.
But, I can help you.
That is good.
Pain?
-- Yes, but I can be uithouden.
Is all well with you?
It is enough for today.
Yes, thanks.
Yes, good.
It has been scientifically proven that everyone
His favourite word their own name is ...
If you simply their name
Says out loud, right?
You can see that it makes them happy.
Hr. Heula. And this should Bianca.
Welcome, come inside.
I have my boots, I
My shoes not included.
Make you do not worry.
Baxter, dear ...
Boys, this is my man.
How is it with you?
Is that for me Bianca?
Thank you.
Can Baxter something to drink for you
Retrieve, from the kitchen?
Beer?
And Bianca?
She does not drink.
It is also not like if I drink.
But I assume there is one.
I can help you with your jackets.
This is Margo, this is Bianca.
Hello, Bianca.
I am glad that you have that memo
Circulated. I would have gone out of my roof.
It's so bizarre.
It is a disease.
-- What a rare snuiter.
Look well to him. He is in love
That sletterige piece silicone.
That is Bianca.
-- Has he sex with her?
Since it is meant for, yes.
I hear that you are going to marry.
-- Yes. -- No.
I would do a murder,
She has her as such.
I would like it a bit.
Long and short front from behind.
Lars would never want it
Afknipte. Boys and long hair.
That makes me no difference.
Where they hold, since I also love.
This is a man to my taste.
I have a glass of wine.
I recall it well.
Someone something?
-- No, thanks.
Lars, Bianca is really a baby.
Thanks.
The best is yet, they do not know
How horny they are.
That does you a woman.
They remain with you because they do not know
That she is someone who can get better.
How is that possible?
Is it flexible?
Yes.
Do you like?
I am so happy.
That is the only.
And as he saw us, when we
Small meadow went past.
And we wrote and kerfden
In the bark of the trees.
In the fine sand of the various mass.
All in harmony with sadness
And summoned by the prayer of Dulcinea.
But what he most sad
Made was ...
That there was no other hermit,
Biecht for him to take.
Pain?
It is OK.
That is good, that can
I do.
You must be excited,
That there is a baby.
Do not you uncle?
Do you want to be a mother?
-- I do not know.
Yes.
But I never have children
Can get.
Bianca is also true.
Yes, it is also unable to have children.
That is a pity.
When she was a baby,
Her mother died, so ...
When she was born.
Like that of you.
You have a lot in common.
Lars, you know that we have a hope
Learned ...
Since then. Things are better.
Yes, but it can still happen.
-- That is highly unlikely.
That is rare.
Yes, but it would still can.
Take a breath.
It is good.
I am sorry.
I am sorry. It's just as dangerous.
It is so dangerous.
-- Sit down.
Put your head between your knees.
Sit down.
Stop just your head between
Your knees. Bend forward.
I am sorry.
-- It is good.
Take a breath.
I hope that they are soft.
You would have to be soft.
We can all do what we want.
You do all your things, and I am at work.
What do you think about in the afternoon?
On Monday and Wednesday ...
And then all day Saturday.
Yes, you know sure?
Bianca, do you think that good?
Bianca wants as a volunteer in
The hospital on Thursday afternoon.
Me too.
And your blood pressure?
Think of all those children.
Would that not great?
That is true.
-- Learn what layers, and then structure it ...
I do not know what you
There thinking, but ...
I find that fun.
That looks sweet.
Are you sure.
It grows no more.
What's that for a sound?
By Veronica, and Charles .
He is no better, do you?
No, probably not.
He will his entire life
That thing, and ...
That's all my fault.
No, that's not it, it's ...
I do not know.
I mean, I am as soon as possible
The house assumed.
I have never thought of him.
And then we have two.
We went to here,
Entirely happy.
And he goes to the garage,
Just like the family dog.
And I did that.
No wonder that he is a fiancée
In a box orders.
Come here.
We are up.
What's going on?
There is a feast volunteers
Of the hospital. At the V & W.
Does it not nice?
-- It looks good.
We were going scrabbelen.
Are you sure?
Her calendar hangs on the refrigerator.
Have you looked there?
No, I did not. I think
Forget that I am.
Can I do a lot even with her
Only, please.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You are my girlfriend. This would
I do not need to look to the calendar ...
Can not even own the phone
Recording, and let me know?
They never quarrel.
I am prepared to go to
Scrabbelen ...
His tone is not me.
Listen now look at me.
Bianca has a life of its own.
Not a woman with self-esteem
You need to call ...
And the sooner you learn that the better.
Yes? -- Yes.
You are the whole day on the job,
What should they do?
On you wait? Would you that
It do?
Would they even ask you?
She is outside in the community,
Doing things for others, which are less ...
Fortunately than we do.
You should be proud of her.
And I then?
-- Large baby.
He is like my husband.
We are at eleven o'clock at home.
She is my girlfriend. I should its agenda
Not having to look to see her.
Is all well with you?
How would they feel if
I just went her way?
Her so would leave.
She has not abandoned you,
She comes back.
And how do I know that?
People do what they want.
It may be they do not care.
-- It may be what we all care.
Lars, what can we do care.
No, you do not.
That is not true.
Everybody in the city is doing its utmost,
Bianca so that feels good.
Why do you think that they
Go can go, and ...
So much to do.
I do not know.
-- That is because of you.
Because all those people of yours.
We push her wheelchair.
We drive her to work,
We drive her home.
We wash her, we dress her.
We help her stand up.
We put her in bed.
We help her.
It is not small, Lars.
Bianca is a big girl.
None of this is easy for us,
But we do it.
We do it for you.
Dare me not to tell,
That we are not included.
I think that the person who is upset should
Say that he is upset ...
Because I can not ...
How was the game?
The kaascontroleurs have us
Us Thursday.
Is everything okay?
I put Bianca usually in bed.
I will tell you.
We wanted them to talk with you.
You need that no longer do.
I do that.
Are you sure? I think not
Bad, and I thought that you ...
It is such a day.
-- It is good.
It is up to you, and ...
But I will leave you alone.
What is happening?
-- Thank you.
I have done nothing.
-- Yes, you have a lot.
I am tired.
Have I missed something?
-- We had a big quarrel.
Really?
-- Yes.
Have you no palèniki,
It is not so warm.
I think what the cold outside.
Lars, have you already discovered Erik?
-- Not officially.
You are very famous here.
It also provides a solid basis, size.
Yes?
In my office?
I think I stay.
She feels good krute today.
That leaves us both.
I asked last week
Or she wants to marry me.
Congratulations.
Where is the happy day?
She has said no.
I know. I could not believe it.
Stop it. You have the right not
So to me talking. Are you not?
No, you do not know.
I am also not talking to you.
I was talking to Bianca, and ...
And she said that in her culture,
Written passages ...
Rituals and ceremonies, and ...
An awful lot of things that
If you do ...
Or if you handle it finished.
If you have doorleeft, you mature.
Sounds not that great.
Yes, that is true.
How do you know that?
What do I know?
That you are a man.
No, I can not tell you.
Was it sex?
It is a kind of sex,
But it's not ...
I do not know, it's ...
A good question.
Yes, but I need to know.
Hold that thought.
You would have to ask to Dagmar.
I am referring to Dagmaar asked.
She said that I had to ask it to you.
I can give you only my opinion.
-- That I would also just.
It is not that you or one of
The other are ...
There is still a child inside.
But you grew up ...
If you decide that this is best.
And not only what is good for you,
But what is good for everyone.
Even if it hurts.
What then?
Like ...
You take people not in the leg,
Deceiving you and your wife.
And you ensure your family,
And you admits that you are wrong.
That try anyway.
That is all I can think of.
It sounds simple, but
One way or another is that it is not.
I know. Because nothing is easy.
It's like those old, he required
Not only for two children, ...
He had us to an orphanage
Can bring people do that.
But he loved us, and he
Tried to do the right ...
Even though he knew not how it was.
Even though his heart was broken.
I had you not only have to be with him.
He had too much pain, which made
Scared me ...
And I am just weggerend.
That was egoïstisch.
And that I am sorry.
That is not bad.
You are transferred stripe.
You remained gappen my action figures.

What therefore Margo, you are
Indeed too old for that thing.
Get that there sling. -- No.

See's face, the bear is dead.
Good for you.
I warned her.
It is not just a beer.

Yes, I had not even
A good reason.
He was not as interest.
Why was he your boyfriend?
Because I was lonely.
Thank you.

The schoolcommissie.

No, I do not hope that you
Have thought, Lars.
That I would never do.
That I would never do.
Good.
A man deceives his wife not,
And so as that.
Absolutely, and not vice versa.
Besides, I need nobody
Friend to steal.
I will be a man I find themselves, and ...
We will also happy.
Yes, I think that it works.
Thank you.

I hoped that the winter was over.
No, it is still autumn.
Winter lasts until Easter.
Thanks again.
Good night, Lars.
I am not sure if all
These operations may work.
No?
What do you think?
I do not know.
I am sorry.
I do not know, it's difficult because ...
I know that it takes me. But I ask
Her to marry me, and said says no.
She says, I do not know.
Or they say nothing.
Nothing?
When I was a child,
I am talking as a child.
Feels that good?
Waking up.
They do not want to wake up.
I think she was unconscious.
Are you sure? -- Look me up.
Bianca is unconscious.
-- Can you hear me?
Waking up.
It seems to go well with her.
Call 911.
I do not know. Why you expect
I know what I should do?
They are there, call Dr. Birnman.
I am sorry, you will have to wait here.
The doctor is now underway.
What?
What?
Bianca is very sick.
No, that's not it.
Come on, she's not sick.
That it is not.
She is dead.
We keep her here until
It is stable, but ...
Lars they want to bring home tonight.
Can I see her.
-- Sure.
What?
I am sorry, but I just do not get the picture.
I mean, what will the impact on him.
How can you let this happen?
I let this not happen, it's Lars.
It is always Lars.
He makes the decisions.
He found her unconscious.
He is the one who says that they are dead.
Is everything back there with you?
They have given her something,
So she sleeps.
Is there something that you want, Lars?
I want her to continue tonight
In the pink room.
Come down to the living room, Lars.
Let Bianca rest.
We have to Gus and Karin
The film.
They wanted not only you.
I am glad that they have done.
I am pleased that they have gone away.
I feel terrible that this all
Happen, just when the baby is already so soon.
It is life, Lars.
Everything comes at a time.
We have a stoofschotel included.
Thank you.
Is there anything that I should do now?
-- No, dear.
Ga but you eat.
We came here only to
Trapped.
That is what people do when
There is a tragedy strikes.
Then they go, and
They are going to sit there.
Feel you you are not a little better?
I have the lentekoorts we go to the lake.
Would you also coming?
Lars, why will you not be with us?
That will be all good.

It seems to me according to a storm.
I have even stretch my legs.
Let the gambling but car.
I think we have to the water
Continue to watch.
We are not far away.
Call us if you need it.
Think you that by driving?
I do not know? Is that
Not in pregnant women?
I believe it. Make careful.
Not run.
Lars has asked us to
Not to wear black today.
That he has done to us to
Remember that this is no ordinary funeral.
We are here to Bianca's
Special live comfortably.
From her wheelchair, Bianca
reached out and touched us all.
In a way that we never had
May propose.
She was a teacher.
It was a lesson in courage.
And Bianca loved us all.
Especially Lars.
Especially from him.

They asked me not to be sad.
But I can not do anything about it.
Yes, I do not.

Be better.

I think it is in any way
True.
But there will never be someone
As they are.
