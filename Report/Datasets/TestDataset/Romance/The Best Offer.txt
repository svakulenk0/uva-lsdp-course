Pinewood marriage chest
with groove joinery
and hand-forged hinges
in the shape of tulip buds.
Walnut sideboard.
of herms and griffin-shaped cartouches.
Embellished deplorably in the 19th century.
A pair of oak veneer cabinets
in the Flemish style.
Upper section with two doors,
featuring carved anthropomorphic
figures and caryatids.
Something wrong, Mr. Oldman?
Is it something important?
If you were kind enough
to let me have this as a gift,
I'd be delighted to accept.
I don't remember that object.
It may look like a useless
piece of mouldy wood,
but centuries ago, beneath the mould,
there must have been a painting.
- Good evening, Mr. Oldman. How are you?
- Very well.
The management and staff of Steirereck
would like to offer our very best wishes,
Mr. Oldman.
Happy birthday, Mr. Oldman.
This year, our chefs wish
to dedicate in your honour
an ancient recipe of a
Renaissance dessert
made of choux cream and bitter almonds.
Enjoy.
- Most likely a rash or something.
- lt must be that.
Was it not to your taste, Mr. Oldman?
Quite the contrary, but you see,
my birthday is tomorrow.
It is now 10:35 p.m.
and I'm very superstitious.
Pretend I had accepted.
The day after tomorrow, then.
The director of the Vatican Museums
would be grateful if you could call him back.
The reliquary attributed to Cellini, I presume.
In any case, the report on this is ready.
There's a pile of gifts.
What shall I do with them?
Send them all to my house
except the mobile phone.
- Only one this year.
- Good.
Word's out that I hate those things.
Unless you've changed the habits of a lifetime,
you'll have to answer that yourself, Virgil.
It's the first call on your birthday.
Tradition.
Hello.
Please, believe me.
I have no wish to waste your time.
- Who's speaking?
-
You can speak to me.
It makes no difference.
You see, I don't know anybody.
I'm on my own.
I'm sorry, Miss lbbetson,
but this is not a charity helpline.
You see, I'm not in the habit
of speaking to people very much.
Believe me, that's a considerable
stroke of good fortune.
Talking to people is extremely perilous.
-
- However, it was you who made the call,
so you're running the risk.
It's about furniture that belong
to my parents' villa.
-
- I understand.
Well, I've always heard it
referred to as being of...
So what?
To be honest, I haven't decided yet,
but I would like to have a...
- Valuation.
-
That is why I asked to speak to Mr. Oldman.
To make an appointment.
Does Mr. Oldman already have
the pleasure of knowing you?
Mr. Oldman's assistants are responsible
for preliminary assessments.
If you hold on, I'll put you through.
Mr. Oldman never presides
over early appraisals.
Dad told me that if I decided
to sell everything,
I should entrust the auction sale
to Mr. Virgil Oldman.
Sold!
Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me
great pleasure to present lot 231,
an ancient refracting elongated telescope
constructed by the Italian scientist Galileo Galilei.
And it's still in perfect working order.
Can we open bidding, please,
at €1,000,000?
- 1,100,000.
- 1,100,000.
€2,000,000.
At €2,000,000!
Gesundheit. Was that a bid, sir?
At €2,000,000. 2,100,000.
At 2,700,000. Any more? Are we all done?
At €2,700,000 euros.
Sold! Congratulations, sir.
Lot 232.
Disciple of Boris Gregorian, Thurst.
Oil on canvas, 60 x 70.
This one will go to the best offer.

€20,000. At 20,000 euros.
Any more? Sold!
Beautiful, isn't it?
Yes. Very.
You never miss a trick, do you, governor?
- Who is it really?
- Yansky.
A Russian painter who died young
in the late '30s.
An outstanding landscape painter.
But among his many splendid landscapes,
he painted three portraits.
Only three in his whole life.
And this is one of the three.
It's double, all right?
How long have we known each other, Virgil?
Quite a while.
We've pulled off some sharp tricks
time after time.
Remember Milo Hensen?
You were the only one who knew from
the start he was going to be really big.
We got that portrait of his mother for a song
from under the noses of that bunch of idiots.
Must be worth a fortune now.
You almost sound bitter
you didn't get a bit more.
Have we ever talked about money,
you and me?
- In all honesty, no. Never.
- It's been good enough for you.
It's always been good enough for me,
your misery.
What matters is that you're satisfied.
My only regret is never being able
to persuade you
that my paintings are evidence
of a great artistic talent.
The love of art and knowing how to hold
a brush doesn't make a man an artist.
You need an inner mystery. A knack,
my dear Billy, you've never possessed.
You're right. Double wasn't enough.
never has anyone had the gall to keep
me waiting 40 minutes under the rain.
It's a disgrace!
An appalling display of bad manners!
Please, let me explain.
I tried to call you office.
- Be quiet! There's no excuse.
-
Never come near me again,
do you understand?
But nobody answered and
I don't have your mobile number.
I do not possess a mobile phone.
lt's the lbbetson woman on the phone.
- Tell her to go to hell.
- She's crying. Sounds desperate.
Serves her right.
She was hit by a car.
She was on her way to meet you.
So much the worse for her.
It's no concern of mine.
She said she was left unconscious.
She was lying in a pool of blood
when the ambulance arrived.
All right. Put her through.
- Yes?
-
I had no intention to be
in any way disrespectful.
Nothing too serious, I hope.
Good. Well, I hope you make
a speedy recovery.
Would you consent to make
a new appointment?
-
- All right.
But I must tell you I'm sending an assistant.
I hope it's the same one
that I spoke to last time.
What do you mean?
Well, I can't explain it,
but I understood from the outset
that voice could only have been yours,
Mr. Oldman.
Truly surprising, wouldn't you say?
We think we'll be able
to bring out the whole face,
part of her dress and the left side
of the background.
Incredible! But what made
Mr. Oldman think that it would?
- What period would you say it's from?
- Too soon to say.
Perhaps Mr. Oldman
will be able to work this out
more quickly and better than us.
- It's a fake.
- How is that possible?
- It's beautiful!
- I didn't say it was ugly.
I said it wasn't authentic.
From an initial analysis
of the pigments and wood,
we thought it was pre-17th century.
- Even older, if that matters.
- Then it must be worth something.
It is a work by Valiante, the celebrated
female forger of the 16th century.
She copied the masterpieces of her day,
but she couldn't sign them,
because she was a woman.
So she marked them with a personal code
hidden in the folds of the drapery
or in the present case,
in the gaze of the subject.
The beam of light on the iris
is nothing if not a V.
That is Valiante.
It is worth something,
but nothing compared to the original.
- Are you Mr. Oldman's assistant?
- Yes.
I'm Fred, the caretaker.
Pleased to meet you.
- Please, come in.
- Thank you.
And Miss lbbetson?
Miss Ibbetson sends her apologies,
but during the night
she was running a temperature.
She should have called me. I could have
spared myself another wasted trip.
Well, give her my best wishes.
Miss Ibbetson asked if you would
go ahead with the valuation.
She's instructed me to show
you around the house.
Everything's at your disposal.
Come with me.
In fact, Miss lbbetson was hoping
to meet your boss.
It doesn't matter, considering
your mistress didn't show up either.
Fair enough.
Anyway, I suppose it'll get
the job done quicker.
Forgive the mess.
It's gone to wrack and ruin ever since
Miss lbbetson's parents died.
Let's go up.
How long since the owners died?
By the look of the place,
you'd think it was centuries ago,
but it's only been one year.
First Mrs. Ibbetson and then,
scarcely 45 days later,
poor Mr. Ibbetson.
You have a good look. Take your time.
Just getting these curtains open.
Too many windows in this room.
Okay.
How many brothers and sisters
does Miss lbbetson have?
None at all. She's an only child.
- Is she married?
- No.
- Has she ever been?
- No, no.
I don't think she even has a boyfriend.
- Grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, in-laws?
- No, none at all.
As far as I know,
Miss lbbetson is on her own.
So many rooms.
You know, I've never managed
to count them all.
Have there been other valuations
before me?
Absolutely none. Yours is the first.
Miss lbbetson is extremely fond of this house.
Maybe too fond.
She would have prefer to keep everything,
but what can you do?
The empire crumbles.
A woman on her own can't cope.
Is she thinking of putting
the house up for sale as well?
That, I don't know. Maybe a part of it.
I don't think she'll get rid of the whole place.
What kind of work does Miss Ibbetson do?
I couldn't say. I only dealt with her parents.
- May I see the cellars?
- It's this way.
It's a long way down.
Go ahead.
I honestly don't get it.
In all the months I've known you,
Robert, I've never seen you beaten.
I've watched you produce all manner
of weird and wonderful gadgets
from the most unremarkable ironwork.
Optical or arithmetical devices, water clocks...
Even that hairdryer that probably
dried the locks of Jules Verne's wife.
But you've nothing to say
about this curious contraption?
I'm surprised that an art
connoisseur like yourself
can get so carried away
by a banal piece of ironwork.
It's not the object in itself
that arouses my curiosity,
but it's contradiction.
- Contradiction?
- Look.
I found it in this position
in contact with damp flooring,
but the rust is all along the top
of the cogs, nowhere near the damp.
What does all this mean?
That the object plainly hadn't
been there for very long.
Probably got rusted in some other place.
Or someone turned the thing upside down.
That's all, nothing more than
a useless exercise in deduction.
Hi, Robert. Did you manage it?
Did you ever doubt me, huh?
This works perfectly now.
And I transcribed the recording
from the tape.
You're a genius. How much do I owe you?
Oh, nothing.
So maybe one day you'll invite me to diner.
Count on it.
- Can I give you a kiss?
- Yes, you can!
That is one thing I am good at.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
William Adolphe Bouguereau,
The Birth of Venus.
Authentic.
Umberto Veruda, The Honest, 1890.
I don't like to appear.
I prefer to remain in the shadows.
That doesn't mean we'll be able to agree.
My secretary's been going mad
looking for you.
How do you know that an unknown painter
will become famous and collectable?
Intuition, Miss Ibbetson. The same intuition
that makes me doubt your intentions.
Sorry if I've given you that impression,
but I've already entrusted you with my belongings.
That's not how things work.
There has to be a signed contract
before an inventory can be drawn up.
It's a lenghty process,
and unless you stop fooling around
and decide to come out into the open,
it will never even get started.
And we'll reach an agreement.
You have my word.
- Take these paper samples.
- Yes, sir.
Be careful!
I'm not sure, but it looks German to me.
Austrian. Careful with that.
It's almost 11:00,
the appointment was for 8:30.
Oh, she's not answering her mobile,
but if she said she'll come, she'll be here.
It doesn't look like the piano
needs restoration.
Quite so. We only have to check
the keyboard, but we don't have the key.
Well, here it is.
- Last time there was no key on the lock.
- Looks good.
Mr. Oldman!
Would you help me with the bookcase?
Italian bookcase in solid wood.
First half of...
Who smashed this?
Nobody, Mr. Oldman, it was already broken.
Is this part of the house inhabited?
Why?
There have been some changes.
I don't know why--
No, no, Mr...
I'm sorry, I'm not sure of your name.
I thought you were...
It doesn't matter who I am.
But I assure you nobody lives here.
Be that as it may, if your mistress
is not materialised by midday,
I will have no option but to suspend
operations and remove myself.
Mr. Oldman!
Miss lbbetson.
Mr. Oldman, I don't know how to apologise.
I don't know what must you think of me.
At least spare me
the self-serving justifications.
I cannot lay a hand on your possessions
without a signed contract. Is that clear?
Would you be so kind and leave it
on the table in the hallway?
You'll find it signed.
I accept all your conditions.
Yes, but I do not accept yours, Miss Ibbetson.
I'm not in the habit of doing business with
the phantom of a silly, superficial woman!
- Be careful!
-
I can quite understand your exasperation,
Mr. Oldman.
But please believe me
I didn't mean anything by it.
It's been a series of unfortunate,
unintentional mishaps.
So what exactly happened today,
Miss Ibbetson?
My car was stolen and I had
to go to the police to report it.
Which police station did you go to?
-
- Whereabouts in the city centre?
-
- Which square?
That's enough of this interrogation!
No more of this!
Are you here, Miss lbbetson?
What do you mean?
What kind of question is that?
Are you here?
- lf you're here, come out at once and explain
-
the meaning of this senseless game,
which I do not find in the least amusing.
Call me tonight at around 9 o'clock.
I'll explain everything.
Well, it's the same material
and the same workmanship too.
Yeah, there is no doubt these
belong to the same system.
There's no signature, no mark, no inscription?
I mean, I've got the rust and
the oxidisation off the other piece.
There's nothing.
I can do the same with these, but,
I mean, right now, I can't see anything.
What have you found?
The technique, in which the cog
has been attached to it's axis.
I mean, it's old, really old.
I've never seen anything like it.
Here, look. Have a look.
It's 18th century.
We could be onto something big here.
Could you hazard a guess as to what it is?
Three pieces of the mosaic
is just not enough, Mr Oldman.
In the last few years
the old couple were both unwell.
The house was in a terrible state even then.
Mr. lbbetson was always saying that
sooner or later they'd have to sell something.
And Miss Claire. How old is she?
About 27.
What else can you tell me about her?
Nothing really.
I've never had much to do with her.
I don't really know her at all.
And yet you've been in the service
of the lbbetsons for about 10 years.
Well, 11 years to be exact.
But as I was saying,
I didn't have much to do with her.
I've talked to her a thousand times
at all hours, but...
But?
To tell you the truth, I've never seen her.
- How could that be?
- It's the truth. Not once.
Why?
Because Miss Claire suffers
from a very strange illness.
-
- Good evening, Miss Ibbetson. It's Oldman here.
Believe me, I have no wish to quarrel
and I'm sorry if I was rude today.
But if on one hand I confirm I am available,
at the same time I cannot permit this joke
in poor taste to continue any longer.
I wish to tell you to cease
all involvement in my affairs.
Let me have your bill for expenses.
Good night.
Lot 93. Valiante. Portrait of a Lady.
First half of the 16th century,
inspired by the Portrait of
a Young Girl by Petrus Christus.
Oil on wood. 30 x 40.
I have here an opening bid of £20,000.
- 22,000.
- 22,000.
At 70,000.
Any advance on 70,000?
Any more?
All done at £80,000.
All done at 80,000.
£90,000.
Any more?
Sold!
- Thank you, sir.
- I offered £90,000 too.
Mr. Oldman should have been aware of that.
I don't believe so, Mrs. Durane.
Mr. Whistler made the bid of £90,000.
- He was the only one.
- They bid simultaneously.
She got her bid in first. I saw it.
What should we do, Mr. Oldman?
I am the biggest collector of
Valiante forgeries and I'll sue you!
You were too slow, Billy!
That's all there is to it!
You didn't get in with your bid in time!
And you were too late! Too late!
You didn't keep up with me for Christ's sake!
The old trout was behind me. If I'd seen her,
I'd have committed another bid.
You're losing it! You're losing it! You're losing it!
Maybe you're right, maybe I'm
not up to it like I used to be,
but it's not the first time we've messed up.
It's the way things go.
Never went into a rage like this before.
That wasn't a Valiante forgery.
It was the genuine one article
by Petrus Christus.
It'll be worth £8 million.
Woe be me.
I'm sorry. Honestly.
But even when we lost Van Gogh's
Lady With The Fan,
you didn't take it this hard.
What's going on, Virgil?
- What will you have?
- 1,581.
Tea, thank you.
Sorry, darling, 8,625.
Take a closer look, you moron.
Shit, You're right! 8,725. Well done, girl!
That's it?
- Bye!
- Bye!
I gave them a thorough clean
with this special fluid.
And I have studied them
millimetre by millimetre.
And look what's come up.
Vaucanson!
- I can't believe it!
- Jacques Vaucanson.
When I was a student, I did my thesis on him.
That's incredible!
It seems one of his most famous
androids even managed to talk.
Exactly. People would pay money
to ask it questions.
The android would move its head,
bow, and give its reply.
You know, I bet there was
someone hiding inside.
A dwarf maybe.
Just like Edgar Allan Poe suspected
in the case of Maelzel's Chess Player, huh?
More than likely.
But the mystery that nobody
was ever able to explain
was how Vaucanson's
automaton always got it right.
Of course there was some trickery
in making the automaton talk.
But everything it said was true.
You bring me all the pieces,
and I promise I can put them back together
exactly how Vaucanson had them.
I don't doubt it, but I fear I've lost the chance
of getting my hands on the missing pieces.
Well, they must be in the same place
that you found these.
And all I need is 80% of the elements,
and I can work out the rest
and rebuild it myself.
It's not that easy.
I'm sorry, Mr. Oldman. That's my girlfriend.
Hey, Sarah. Sarah, this is Mr. Virgil Oldman.
Pleased to meet you, Sarah.
It's a pleasure. Robert has told me
so much about you.
I thought young people had more
exciting things to talk about.
Listen, why don't you come
and grab a bite with us?
That's very kind. Another time, thank you.
All right, we won't insist. But it's a promise.
- Bye.
- Goodbye.
Cancel the trip to New York and tell
the Alphasons to meet us here.
It was us who called the meeting.
So we've changed our minds.
Is that a problem?
All right, Mr. Oldman.
Claire lbbetson's been on the phone.
What does she want now?
She asked whether you could
meet her today at 2:30.
Meet her where?
At the lbbetson villa.
Where else?
I'm extremely grateful to you for
accepting the invitation, Mr. Oldman.
How did you know it was me?
Ah.
To be honest I didn't expect
you'd want to speak to me.
I know you can't stand my excuses.
If I were you, I wouldn't either.
In fact, your beh... How should I put it?
I won't deny that your whimsical little
ways are getting a bit tiresome.
But I wanted to say sorry for...
well, for my behaviour.
Typical of a "silly, superficial woman",
as you put it.
Why do you systematically
avoid meeting me?
Of course I wouldn't assume
you'd want to do business
with a person who arouses
such deep seeded aversion in you
that you can't even look him in the face?
It's not easy to explain to you, because
I know you won't believe me anyway.
If I didn't believe you, I wouldn't be
here playing hide and seek.
I see nothing serious in that.
Everybody has moments when
they prefer solitude to the multitudes.
- I don't think I understand.
-
If there's somebody wandering
around the house or in the villa,
I've always done that,
even when my parents were here.
But why?
Why do you go around with
your hands covered by gloves?
lt's a simple question of hygiene.
I don't see the connection.
It disgusts you to put your hands
near their possessions.
I'm afraid of going to places
where other people live.
These seem to me very
similar personal choices.
You'd like me to believe that for 12 years
you haven't walked along a street?
Wanting to be a hermit and employing
a caretaker in the house doesn't add up.
I walk about quite a bit,
if that's what you want to know.
And I hope that, within the limits
of your profession, you'll help me.
You have my word, Miss lbbetson.
I leave it to you to set your fee.
I trust you blindly.
Apart from your fondness for my gloves,
what made you decide to call me again?
I haven't been particularly kind to you.
I was taken by the way you were
looking at my house yesterday
You found the missing pieces.
In the meantime, you'll have
to make do with just this one.
How much would the automaton be worth,
if we managed to put it together
and make it work?
Think of a really, really high figure.
- Do you have one in mind?
- Yes.
You've probably made the mistake
of pitching it too low.
You know, you're very good at talking
without actually saying anything.
I'll take that as a compliment.
In any case, should things go
the way I trust they will,
you'll be very handsomely rewarded.
Listen, I didn't mean to talk about money.
It's a real privilege for me.
Where did you on earth find these rarities?
There are very precise rules
in the world of antiques.
It's forbidden to reveal one's sources.
There's a few more gears
but bigger in that corner.
Gather them together. I'll take
care of the cataloguing myself.
Of course.
Candlesticks.
- Which period?
- 17th-century. Repair.
Mr. Oldman.
Yes?
What have you decided
about the furniture in this wing?
We're only at the stage of
drawing up the inventory.
After that, you can tell me what to leave out.
Listen, Miss lbbetson, I can't help
thinking about your situation.
That's not the point.
I've been wondering how
you can live like this.
I don't need any help,
but I appreciate your concern.
You're welcome.
- See you soon, then.
-
Perfect.
But I see your personal details are missing.
But it expired quite some time ago.
-
- That's true enough, I suppose.
I was just a girl then,
but it'll do for your purposes.
I wanted to mention
that in certain critical cases
my advice is to proceed
directly to restoration.
It means the whole thing
will take a little longer.
We can widen the scope of the valuation.
I'm disgusted by people who don't
trust the colour of their own hair!
I trust even less people who have
such a high opinion of themselves
that they won't even poke
their nose outside the door!
Ah, sir, there'll be no more
caretaker service as from Monday.
I'll just come in to bring
Miss lbbetson her shopping.
- The matter is of little interest to me.
- These are the keys for the house.
- Why give them to me?
- It's what Miss lbbetson wanted.
In case you needed access
for further inspection.
When you come in, slam the door,
otherwise she'll get scared and panic.
I'm going off my head trying to work out
the alignment of these devices,
you know, just trying to figure out
which one fitted into which.
- That can't be easy.
- But not impossible.
You know, gearboxes are like people.
If they've been together long enough, then,
eventually, they take on each other's forms.
So, you believe time can make
any kind of co-habitation possible?
Yeah, well, absolutely.
You've reminded me of a friend of mine,
who met a much younger girl.
She was inflicted with agoraphobia.
What's that?
Fear of open spaces and distances?
Exactly. She lived for years locked
up in an apartment on her own.
Recently, she gave him the keys
to her house and ever since,
he's been in a state of...
...permanent anxiety.
What did I tell you? Now he's gonna
be constantly worried about her.
He's gonna be thinking,
"What does she need,
shampoo, medicine, tights, yoghurt?"
lt's beautiful, isn't it?
I'm not so sure.
Now, you tell your friend to stay calm,
'cause time is already working
on their gearboxes.
And there you are, Mr. Oldman.
-
- Why should I be?
-
- Not at all.
I was just calling to ask if you wish
the sale of the furniture to be
identified by your family name.
Or do you prefer anonymity?
-
- Good.
- Oh?
-
I don't generally give interviews,
but I was forced to.
So, we go to Lot 132.
Gustave Rett,
Portrait of a Woman With a Hat.
This one goes to the best offer.
£10,000.
Fred, any news from Miss lbbetson?
She hasn't answered the phone in days.
It's been a while since
I heard from her too.
Who's been bringing things to eat?
Miss lbbetson?
Miss lbbetson?
Miss lbbetson, answer me!
Claire?
Claire, are you all right?
-
- No, no.
- It's me, Claire.
-
- It's me, Mr. Oldman.
-
- Listen to me, it's Mr. Oldman.
-
There's nobody else here. Calm down.
Claire, what's wrong?
Tell me what happened.
- Claire, open the door!
-
- You need to see a doctor!
-
Can you fix a broken auctioneer as well?
I wouldn't know where to begin.
It's good to see you again, Mr. Oldman.
Is something wrong? You seem
more preoccupied than usual.
Too many woodworms and spider webs
and too few masterpieces.
Could we put it that way?
- So, how's our toy coming along?
- Ah.
Well, I've managed to put
some sections back together.
But, I mean, there's just still
too many pieces missing.
The entire exterior.
And we still can't establish
what kind of character he is.
Like that friend of mine
and his girl in the tower.
Yeah, well, maybe.
Although we've never seen our android.
We're still groping around in the dark.
So is he.
He speaks to her but through a closed door.
- Closed door?
- Yes.
If there's anybody moving about in the house,
she barricades herself in her room.
- You mean he's never seen her face?
- Not only him, no one has.
That's a bit like when two young people
meet on the internet.
The first day they get to know each other,
and then they reveal themselves.
She won't reveal herself.
Maybe that's because
he hasn't got a good strategy.
So, it's more difficult for my friend
to succeed in his enterprise
than for us to reconstruct
the Vaucanson automaton?
Depends on the number of rusty
pieces you're able to bring me.
Well...
Here's one more.
That's a mobile phone.
This is brand new.
I'm the one that's rusty,
because I don't know how to use it.
Do you think you could teach me
before your girlfriend gets here?
- Hello.
-
-
- No, not at all, Miss lbbetson.
I told you, from now on,
you can call me any time you like.
No need. All that's important
is you're feeling better now.
Yes, it was just a small cut
on the head. I'm much better.
I wanted to tell you,
I looked over the inventory.
Oh! What do you think?
I'm not sure if it's a good idea to sell.
What would you advise?
I couldn't say. I don't really
know what your plans are.
Why did you decide to sell in the first place?
Out of necessity in order to start
life afresh or some other reason?
I'd even sell the house.
It's too big for me now.
Sometimes, I feel as though
I were in a public square.
Wear blindfolds? Have myself
carried out while asleep?
I'd get into a state and end up
putting everything off again and again.
You have all the time in the world
to make up your mind, Miss Ibbetson.
-
- Well, I mean until the catalogue is printed.
Don't torment yourself.
Think of yourself, your future.
I didn't know you were working.
I'd like to read them. I'll buy some.
Luckily for both you and me,
you'll never manage to.
Why not?
Because I write under a pseudonym
and I loathe what I write.
Artists always loathe
what they produce, Miss lbbetson.
I wasn't aware. I was in a state of alarm.
- Sorry.
-
"I'd like you to continue."
She said it to him, just like that.
Well, what did he say?
He was taken back, but he went
along with what she wanted.
What else could he do?
I would have asked her to do the same,
call me by my first name.
That's not his style.
Besides, I don't think my friend
intends to court her.
Well, then he'll never get her out of there.
Besides, I don't think my friend
intends to court her.
Besides, I don't think my friend
intends to court her.
What a horrible voice!
I'd have thought he'd at least
have desired to see her face.
Desired's probably not the right word.
Curious to see her, perhaps.
Yes, I could understand that.
But the chances of it happening
seem to be really remote.
Well, there might be a way.
Just depends on how brave your friend is.
- The French bureau with the chiming clock.
-
The table inlaid with brass on elm.
The one with the roll top.
Well, that's it.
Next time, we'll do the paintings.
-
- One last thing, Claire.
You'll have to decide whether we do
the photography here or in a studio.
Better in a studio. I don't want too
many people around the house.
That's the best solution.
Well, I'm off now.
- Anything you need?
-
You mean, when do you see me,
since I am not given that privilege.
-
- But soon.
- Have a good day.
-
- I can't believe it!
- I couldn't sleep at night, Virgil.
I had to do something
to make you forgive me.
But how did you get it?
I heard that Mrs. Durane
had fallen on hard times.
So I persuaded her to sell it to me
for £250,000.
Not exactly cheap!
I thought it was a reasonable price.
You were talking about 8 million.
This way, everyone gets a good deal.
How much do you want, Billy?
I don't want a penny more
than I gave the old girl.
Now you're really losing your grip.
I just want to get back to where we were.
When I was your friend, your accomplice,
your trusted procurer of women.
lf you're doing all this to win back my trust,
Billy, it's been a bad deal for you.
Because you never lost it in the first place.
This is great! This is great!
You found some really important stuff here.
The best bit is this.
- An ear.
- A big step forward, wouldn't you say?
I'd say! I'd say we're at a turning point.
Now, look.
- Huh?
- Excellent!
The pieces are beginning
to attract each other.
So...
How did things go with your... your friend?
How many seconds did it take you
to realise I was talking about myself?
Quite a few, to be honest.
Let me confess, I didn't follow your advice.
There was something too contorted
about it, too imprudent.
Yeah, okay, I see your point.
The mathematical set of a 6-day week.
The mathematical set of a 51-minute hour.
What will you have, sir?
- Have you thought of anything else?
- Tea, please.
The length of a point.
The direction of a circle.
Your tea's ready, sir.
The edge of a circumference.
The centre of space.
- The area of a segment.
- Amazing. Well done!
The vertical position of a sphere.
I brought you the valuations
of the furniture and paintings.
Cast your eye over them carefully,
because you'll have to authorise them.
-
- I know. You'll have to trust me, Miss lbbetson.
I noticed you've been spending
time in the cellars recently.
- Is that why you had the locks changed?
-
And I take care to double-check,
compare and correct,
especially when dealing with
discarded odds and ends in cellars.
It's how I work. If it upsets you, speak now.
You'll find the new keys on the table.
Please take them.
Thank you for your trust.
No, but I was worried.
Claire, you're ruining your life
for reasons which are beyond me.
This illness of yours is so absurd,
it almost seems unreal.
Even my mother thought
I was faking it the first time.
I was so afraid of walking
at the foot of the Eiffel Tower
I was just a little girl, but it kept on
happening more and more often.
Has there ever been an open space
where you weren't overcome by anxiety?
Only one. During a school trip
to Prague. I was 14.
I must have walked across it
a hundred times. It was beautiful.
I remember a restaurant
with very strange decor.
If there's one place in the world
I'm nostalgic for, it's that restaurant.
- You've never been back?
-
Why not go now? I'd be happy to take you.
Well, you don't seem too pleased.
We're almost there.
Our automaton is about
to emerge from the shadows.
No, I'm delighted. You're a force of nature.
It's just that...
this is one of those evenings when
one feels like this contraption here.
Incomplete.
Why did you never marry, never have kids?
The regard I have for women is equal
to the fear I've always had of them.
And to my failure to understand them.
If that's the rule, then Miss lbbetson gives
every impression of being the exception.
I'm afraid so.
Have you really never set eyes on her?
Just once.
What's she like?
I suppose feeling a certain
interest in a person
necessarily engenders
a conviction that she's beautiful.
Up to a point.
It's her birthday in two days.
I'd like to get her something useful.
Yeah. I don't think useful is
probably your best approach.
- You don't?
- Not the first time.
It's better to get her something more...
traditional.
- Morning, sir.
- Morning.
Hello, sir.
Hey, Mr. Oldman.
Look what I found in the cellar.
I saw you were interested in this old junk.
Oh, the supports for the
big Murano chandelier.
My colleagues couldn't find them.
- If you give me your keys, I'll put them in your car.
- That's very kind.
Wait.
Oh, thanks.
Morning, Mr. Oldman.
I took the liberty of remembering
it's your birthday.
Happy birthday, Claire.
Did you manage to understand some of it?
Even a backwards child could
realise she's being cheated!
I did warn you those figures require
interpretation. Those are the starting bids.
- There'll be higher bids after that.
-
Unlikely, but in that case,
we'll even things out,
by raising the margins we make
on the more important pieces.
A gamble?! Where I'm
the only one that can lose?
It's all to your advantage.
You're a fucking thief!
I'm willing to resign the commission forthwith!
I'll have them replace all your
mediocre bric-a-brac immediately!
And do me the favour of disappearing
completely from the face of the earth!
- Hello.
-
I feel so stupid.
I constantly have to offer justifications.
There's no need for this display
of anguish. I'm not angry with you.
I opened the main door
and looked out onto the garden.
- Did you go out?
-
Do you want me to come over?
There are new treatments nowadays.
They might help you.
- Should I take that as a compliment?
-
I see you've brought up
the portrait of the dancer.
-
- No great value.
She was about my age
when she had it done.
Do you look like her?
-
- Regrettably, I cannot judge.
All right, Claire. I'll go.
Don't hesitate to call
if you need anything at all.
Thank you, Mr. Oldman.
See you soon, I hope.
Hello? Oh, it's you, director.
No, I would've called you. It's just that...
clearing out the furniture has been
more complicated than I expected.
Yes. Oldman is dealing with it.
What's he like?
Not as old as you might think.
He dresses in an odd way,
but he's still a good-looking man.
And I know I can trust him.
Why? Are you jealous?
In love? No, I don't think so.
He's too put off by my illness,
like everybody else.
Oh no, it's nothing. I hurt my foot.
Can we talk later?
Who is it?
Who's there?!
No, get out! No, please, get out!
Go away! Get out!
- Hello?
-
- Calm down, Claire. What's happened?
-
- I'll be there as soon as I can.
-
Claire!
- It's me. I'm here. What's happened?
-
-
- Calm down, Claire. There's nobody here.
-
- Calm down, Claire.
-
- It was me before, Claire. It was me.
It was me.
I hid in the room so I could see you.
Please, Virgil. Don't go.
Believe me, I don't normally behave like this.
Neither do I.
So I'm bound to make some mistakes.
But nothing in the world would
make me want to hurt you.
It's just that I can't help myself.
I need to see you.
You should've seen her.
Pale, like a Durer etching.
She had the look of some creature
terrified of the universe.
And I could read my own terror in her eyes.
Every man on earth would like to be
as terrified as you at this moment.
- You've worked a miracle.
- Well, it's too soon to tell.
And you be careful, all right?
This is when mistakes occur.
When you think you've made it with a woman,
that is when you lose your grip on strategy.
- And what strategy would that be?
- Never stop surprising them.
Do things that they couldn't have
foreseen. Take a gamble, run a risk.
You're asking me to behave
in a way that just isn't me.
That's precisly why you have to do it.
As long as you're playing
according to her rules,
you're always gonna make her feel like...
like a patient.
She needs to be treated like a woman.
What do you think? Do you like it?
I don't know.
What do you think?
lt looks marvellous on you, Claire.
Perhaps the smaller size.
Yes. I think so too.
It's been a long time
since I got a present like this.
- Long overdue, don't you think?
- I don't know.
I'm a little, you know, taken a back.
- I'm sorry, I can't...
- What?
Oh, certainly.
I'm sorry. I didn't understand.
I don't honestly know if I deserve all this.
Let me be the judge of that.
If we don't set a date
for the auction in Stockholm,
they'll shoot themselves.
It's too far. Let them shoot themselves.
Then we have to schedule the meeting
with the director of the Hermitage
and the auctions in
San Francisco and Madrid.
Ditto. Too far away.
- We can't abandon them like this at the last minute.
- There are auctioneers galore in the world.
They'll find somebody else.
And it will cost them less.
As you wish, Mr. Oldman.
Lambert, are you married?
Yes. Nearly 30 years.
What's it like, living with a woman?
Like taking part in an auction sale.
You never know if yours will be the best offer.
- This one.
- Very well, sir.
What do you think?
Have I made myself pretty?
- Beautiful. You've done very well.
- You're a liar.
- Claire.
- I haven't done this for centuries.
- I've completely forgotten how to do it.
- Your hand is a bit unsure,
- I look like a monster.
- but it's not bad.
Trust me. You need some practice
and you'll be wonderful.
And you'll take me to one of your auctions,
and to galas full with elegant people,
and to the most refined restaurants
in the world.
That's the reason for your presents,
isn't it, Virgil?
To help me recover little by little,
and then take me out.
Isn't that right?
No!
Claire, don't be like this. Let's talk.
Maybe we did get the last moves wrong.
I was a bit rash.
Oh, don't blame yourself.
It's her who always manages
to pull everything apart.
Robert, my aunt's gone missing again.
- You're kidding!
- Beg your pardon me.
- We found her in the Central Park.
- I'm so sorry, Terry.
It was no good trying to reset this thing.
It was much more easy
just to make a new one.
This one has a much wider range.
She can wander off as much as she likes,
and you'll never lose touch with her.
Just make sure you reprogram the PC, okay?
I can manage that. You're an angel.
- Thanks, darling.
- No worries.
I'll see you tomorrow night, yeah?
- Yes.
- Okay.
What you need is an idea
that's gonna excite her,
but at the same time
it's gonna reassure her.
Any idea you like, she's still going to see
through it as some deceitful therapy.
- You should invite her to dinner.
- Oh, yes! To the Noma in Copenhagen!
And at the romantic climax
of the evening, by candlelight,
you tell her she's far more
beautiful than her mother.
Yes, and after diner you'll come
and have coffee with us.
If you want to invite me, why not?
Joking apart, I'd be glad
if you did see her, hear her talk.
I'm sure you'd understand far more than I.
Who said anything about joking?
Your champagne.
- See if you can cope with this.
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.
- 12,624,831.333...
You're radiant, Claire.
You did all this?
I can turn my hand to interior decorating.
You've done a wonderful job, Virgil.
Thank you.
I can't tell you how long I've been wanting
to spend time alone with you.
Somewhere quiet,
far from the madding crowd.
To your serenity, Claire.
To your irony, Virgil.
- And now I feel I can finally tell you.
- What?
You are more beautiful than the dancer.
Dinner is served.
- Please be seated.
- Thank you.
But I warn you, as a waiter
I'm not of the highest class.
I offer no guarantees.
- I'll take the risk.
- Somewhat foolhardy of you.
- Why? - Because if the service
were not to be to your liking,
next time I would be obliged to make a
reservation at the finest restaurant in town.
Let's not ruin this evening, Virgil.
- Please, let's not talk about me.
- All right.
Instead I'd like you to tell me
about you, about your past.
You see, Claire, there's nothing
very original about my life.
A child loses his parents,
a horrible orphanage, that sort of thing.
The only point of interest is
that the nuns would punish the boy
by forcing him to work with a restorer,
who had a workshop in the institution.
That's beautiful.
And since he loved to
observe this craftsman,
the little boy started to get up
to all sorts of mischief to ensure
that he would be punished
as frequently as possible.
So he became acquainted with works of art,
the various techniques of painting,
how to tell a forgery from an original,
etc, etc.
You know, in an old article of yours I found
the other day on the internet, you said,
"There's always something authentic
concealed in every forgery."
What did you mean by that?
That in simulating another person's work,
the forger cannot resist the temptation
to put in something of himself.
Often it's just a trifle, a detail of no interest.
One unsuspected brush-stroke,
by which the forger inevitably
ends up betraying himself,
and revealing his own,
utterly authentic sensibilities.
I really love the way you talk.
You couldn't have been more convincing.
Huh? A born seducer.
- So you'd give me a pass?
- A+. With distinction!
Sorry, you've been a bit neglected lately.
You haven't said anything about Claire.
If I didn't know about her problems,
I'd say she was a completely normal woman.
And she's much more beautiful
than you described.
Really, I liked her.
So, now, you're going to make me jealous?
lf you want my advice, Virgil,
you pray that girl never gets better.
Mr/ Oldman, do you want lots
No, together. Always together.
That's important.
How can I help you?
- It's about Robert.
- What's going on?
Don't be afraid to tell me.
We're not getting on so well,
that's the problem.
All those girls hovering around him.
I guess I'm just...
l'm afraid of losing him.
Is there anything I can do?
Do you want me to talk to him?
For a while now he's been talking
about someone called Claire.
Claire?
I don't understand.
With him, everybody's got to
be on their guard, all the time.
That goes for you, too.
I feel so stupid.
Promise me you won't say a word to him.
I promise.
Have you been waiting there long?
lf you'd 've phoned,
I wouldn't have kept you waiting.
- I prefer to speak to you in person.
- Why, is something wrong?
One of my assistants will come by today.
Kindly hand over the Vaucanson as it is.
All right. Whatever you want.
Tell him how much you're owed for
your work. He'll pay you on the spot.
I think I'm at least due an explanation,
aren't I?
You're not the trustworthy, discreet man
I thought you were.
lt's weird seeing them all
so perfect and polished up.
It's as if they weren't mine.
I believe nothing is missing.
There is something missing.
How could you have lived the best
years of your life in here, my darling?
I don't know. I don't know.
It was just the right thing.
"Was".
lt still is.
It always will be.
Always.
You have to get out of here
and you have to do it by yourself.
I don't have the courage.
It's a spider's web that
I'll never know how to break free of.
It's an old collection
my father was very fond of.
I never did understand what it was.
Hello? Good morning, director.
Yes, I'm nearly finished.
But I would like to rewrite the last chapter.
A more upbeat ending.
If that's all you want.
Yes. Talk to you soon. Thanks.
I wouldn't rule out them being
part of something of some value,
but exactly what I wouldn't be able to say.
- I often wonder if...
- What?
lf you're more interested in my
furniture and paintings than in me.
How could you say that?
I shouldn't have let you in here.
I shouldn't have.
I've found all the missing pieces.
How do you feel about finishing the job?
Well, it's your problem.
Sarah came to see me a few days ago.
She seemed very upset
about your relationship.
You are here to advise me now, are you?
I wouldn't dare. When it comes
to women, you're the expert.
All right. We can pick up
where we left off, if you like.
But on two conditions.
And the first is that you just stop
involving me in your private life.
And the second?
Is that you take this back.
I didn't get excited about
your Vaucanson for the money.
I brought it back. It's in the car.
And the new pieces too?
You'll have to be patient a bit longer for those.
They're tied up with my private life.
I don't know and I don't want to know.
If you were forced to choose between
Claire and the automaton, today,
which would you take?
- This one.
- An excellent choice, Mr. Oldman.
If it's not the right size,
please inform the lady to pass by
whenever she wishes.
Thank you, I'll let her know.
Claire, it's me.
Claire, I've brought lunch.
Claire!
Claire, answer me!
Claire!
Claire!
Claire!
Are you down here?
Claire!
Excuse me, but have anyone
of you seen a woman
going out the gate of the villa
across the road?
No, I can't say I have.
Has anybody seen someone
coming out of the villa?
A young woman. Medium height, light hair.
- A bit pale.
- I think I saw her.
- Yes.
- I didn't actually see her go out,
but she was walking away from the gate.
- When?
- This morning I was having breakfast.
- What else can you tell me?
- I don't know what to say. She seemed a bit weird.
- Weird? Which way did she go?
- That way. Towards the park.
Idiot!
- She's gone.
-
- Claire, she's disappeared.
-
I've looked everywhere.
They saw her leave this morning.
-
- Please.
Has this ever happened before?
I tell you, she never even appeared
at the windows.
Just behind the shutters.
Did she have friends,
people she could've gone to?
She always used to sit at the computer
communicating with somebody,
but under different names.
- If she's gone out, she can't have gone far.
- Let's hope so.
I've already been round three times.
- Hello?
-
- Oh, listen, Lambert, has Miss lbbetson phoned?
-
- lf she calls, let me know immediately.
-
Mr. Oldman, I wouldn't like
to think you'd forgotten.
Forgotten what?
-
- Lot number 1.
Late Baroque, Venetian,
mid-18th-century mirror.
Inlaid wood with gold leaf,
carved with adornments,
floral motifs and festoons.
Upper frame richly...
Inlaid wood with gold leaf,
carved with adornments,
floral motifs and festoons.
Upper frame richly engraved with whirls.
Can we say €130,000?
€140,000.
Still nothing, Mr. Oldman.
I'll keep looking here.
-
- All right.
-
- All right.
-
- 280,000.
€310,000. Any more?
Sold!
Virgil, listen, I'm doing the rounds of
the hospitals, but there's nothing here.
Just keep looking.
-
- Thanks, Robert.
Lot number 2.
The extraordinary 17th-century
Fassadenschranke wardrobe
in walnut, maple, oak and ash.
The carved frame surmounts an inlaid stripe,
and two doors engraved
with architectural motifs,
surrounded by carvings of fruit and masks.
Three spiralled, tapered columns
flank the doors.
The lower body has two drawers.
There's nothing for it but to call the police.
It'll be all over the papers.
They'll drag me into it.
Let's wait a bit longer.
What do you hope's gonna happen?
That she'll come back or turn up.
Or they'll find out where she is.
Someone with her problems
doesn't just disappear into thin air.
Well, that depends.
It doesn't matter how deeply rooted it is,
sometimes a phobia can
just disappear by itself.
So, why did she run away?
Maybe something happened
between you two.
And that drove her to take
that kind of decision.
You know perfectly well that's impossible.
You're the only person in the whole world
who knows everything
that happened between us.
Excuse me a minute.
- Hello?
-
They all said that often even they don't know
the identity of authors who use pseudonyms.
I would never have guessed that you
would have ended up in a mess like this.
- I don't even know how I can help you.
- All you had to do was listen.
Considering the lady's illness,
it seems highly unrealistic
that she's just run away.
I'd say, I don't know, she'd been
abducted or something like that.
That's not likely.
I don't think she had any enemies.
It could be somebody became
so besotted with her
that he carried her off by force.
- But who?
- I've had my doubts lately about Robert.
The young guy?
The way you describe him,
he doesn't seem the type.
From the literary point of view, he fits the bill.
The young knight rescuing the damsel
from the clutches of the old man
incapable of love.
Literature, exactly.
Don't go overboard, Virgil.
She could have had her own reasons
for disappearing.
I can't imagine what reasons.
Recently, she's been experiencing
emotions and feelings
that are incompatible with flight.
I wouldn't be so sure, if I were you.
Human emotions are like works of art.
They can be forged.
They seem just like the original,
but they're a forgery.
- Forgery?
- Everything can be faked, Virgil.
Joy, pain, hate.
Illness, recovery.
Even love.
- Hello?
-
Are you sure there are
no other secret rooms in the villa?
I don't remember of being any other doors
like the one to Miss lbbetson's room.
Claire!
The only place we haven't looked at
is the attic. If you want.
Did you know that Miss Claire was a writer?
I heard her parents talk about it.
She used a pseudonym for her books.
I never knew that. To tell you the truth,
I've never seen the books.
I don't think she ever wanted them
around the house.
Claire!
We're just wasting time.
There are no other secret rooms.
- We should--
- Quiet!
Claire?
Claire, I can feel you're there. Answer me.
-
- Of course I have.
Were you afraid I wouldn't?
I thought you'd abandoned me.
- Like last time.
- Last time?
When we got back from Prague.
Claire.
I will never abandon you.
I'd been happy in Prague
in that very odd restaurant.
I was there with my first and only boyfriend.
He was older than me.
When we got back from that excursion,
one afternoon, we were walking
in the city centre.
A car crashed into us.
When I came to, he wasn't there anymore.
I went back home and I never went out again.
I've never slept with a woman.
In fact, I didn't close my eyes.
I spent the whole night just looking at her.
It was wonderful.
Well, welcome to the grown-up club.
You've succeeded in making her fall in love.
I had a good teacher.
Finally, I understood where the dwarf hid.
Look, there must have been
a sunken pedestal here.
The little man would crouch in there
and his voice would reverberate
inside the body.
It must have made a deep impression.
Robert, do you think it's possible
that love can be faked?
Well, in keeping with what you say
about art forgeries,
I'd just say it can't be completely faked.
If one could say love is a work of art.
It'd be amazing if it were, wouldn't it?
lt could be sold off at an auction.
The highest bidder could relive
the greatest love stories in history.
I hope I haven't destroyed
your love story with Sarah.
Oh, no problem. No problem.
A new valve, two hinges, one fuse...
It'll be good as new.
Just like on the first day.
What do you think you're going to do now?
I want to coax her out.
Yeah, I wouldn't push too hard if I were you.
She's too fragile.
You'll see. When you least expect it,
things will just fall into place quite naturally.
No!
Virgil! Virgil!
Virgil?
Help! Help!
- Hold it up!
- It is up!
Why do you say don't you love it?
I've never felt it to be a real home.
More like a hotel.
You come home a night, sleep if you can.
Next morning, you're off somewhere else.
Let's go back inside.
Seems to have been planned
to welcome a lot of people.
Yes, but the plan was never realised.
Except for the inaugural reception.
I was so distrustful of other people
that I kept them strictly away from
the perimeter of my personal hotel.
I was a fool.
Even now, I still get upset
when I see the housekeeper
and the maids walking about.
After dinner, I send them home.
I wasn't wrong when I said
we were very similar.
Yes, you were right.
And thanks to you, I understood.
- Where are you taking me?
- You'll soon find out.
Close your eyes.
I'll tell you when you can open them.
Don't be afraid. I'll lead the way.
I never liked games where
you had to close your eyes.
- Mind the step.
- Gently, please.
We're almost there.
Stop now.
Open your eyes.
I don't believe it.
It's overwhelming.
I've been collecting them all my life.
So, I'm not the first.
You have had other women
Yes.
I've loved them all and they loved me back.
They taught me to wait for you.
And now that you're here,
we'd like you to come and live with us
and make this beautiful hotel your home.
Oh, Virgil.
If anything should ever happen to us,
I want you to know that I do love you.
I love you too.
The catalogue for the auction sale
of the paintings and furniture
of Ibbetson Villa is ready.
- Congratulations, Virgil. This is a lovely volume.
- About time!
I wonder who's gonna buy
this wonderful stuff. Oh, sorry.
I can't conceal my anxiety to know
what you think about it.
Don't you like it?
No, it's just that...
...ever since I decided
to come and live with you...
I've been thinking I don't want
to sell anymore.
I'd like to leave everything the way it was.
I understand.
Are you sure?
Believe me, if I were you,
I'd do the same thing.
Tomorrow, everything
will be back in its place.
All right, Virgil, yes!
To the most tortured and most
fortunate catalogue of my career.
That's saying something.
- Here, here.
- Cheers.
And since you've become my family,
I too have an important
announcement to make.
Next week, I have an auction in London.
It will be the finest of my career
and the very last.
They say he's been seen
recently in female company.
- No! - Who? Virgil? - Yes.
It's finally come home to him that the
worst sexual perversion is chastity.
How do you feel now that you are
on stage for the last time?
I've never felt better. There's
a whiff of anticipation in the air.
All my colleagues have come to see me off.
The reason for this outburst of affection is they
know they won't have to put up with me anymore.
Anyhow, I'm happy, Claire.
I just wish you were here.
But I'm not ready to travel yet.
I got dizzy in the car yesterday.
Don't let it get to you. We have
all the time in the world to travel.
- We're ready, Mr. Oldman.
- I'm coming.
Have you heard from our young friends?
Constantly. I'm never left on my own,
if that's what you're worried about.
Good. Give them my love.
-
- Yes.
- But I can't wait to get back home.
-
£12,100,000.
Any more?
£12,300,000.
Any advance?
Any more?
All done at 12,500,000.
Sold for £12,500,000.
Ladies and gentlemen, I thank you.
- Good to see you.
- Thank you. Not a bad price.
Am I allowed to say hello to you in public?
Oh, Billy!
You were fantastic, my friend.
I'm happy for you. I'm going to miss you.
You say it as though we're
never going to meet again.
Of course we will.
But I'm feeling nostalgic
thinking about all our exploits.
- You'll get over it.
- Virgil?
To remind you of what
a great artist I could've been
if only you'd believed in me,
I've sent you one of my paintings.
I promise I won't burn it.
Claire.
Claire, I'm back.
Hello?
- Have you seen Miss Claire?
- No, sir.
Claire?
Where are you?
Claire?
Mr. Oldman, she must have gone out.
It was the same yesterday.
Sarah and Robert came to get her,
and then came back for lunch.
All right.
There is always something authentic
concealed in every forgery.
I couldn't agree more.
That's why I'll miss you, Mr. Oldman.
There is always something authentic
concealed in every forgery.
There is always something authentic
concealed in every forgery.
There is always something authentic
concealed in every forgery.
I couldn't agree more.
That's why I'll miss you, Mr. Oldman.
There is always something authentic

There is always something authentic

Good morning, Mr. Oldman.
We have visitors today.
Isn't this nice? Look who's come to see you!
How are you, Mr. Oldman?
I've brought your mail,
some newspapers and a few magazines.
A few days ago, they brought some
pieces of furniture to the villa opposite.
Did you notice?
I think so, but I don't see much from in here.
Ask her.
Claire...
Listen to what this gentleman wants to say.
Yes.
And the day after,
other workmen came and
took everything away again.
The day after?
In 18 months,
three deliveries and three removals.
I was here a while ago.
- Do you remember?
- Nine.
- What do you mean?
- You've been here nine times.
Today makes ten.
I was wondering if you saw
a woman leave the villa.
Medium height, light hair, a bit pale?
- Yes.
- That time was 231.
Are you sure?
Then another 6.
In a year and a half,
I saw her go out 237 times.
What did I say?
She's a phenomenon.
She remembers everything.
It's not possible.
You were at the villa 63 times.
excluding the night of the accident.
- 1-4-4.
- 1-4-4?
The telephone number for the ambulance.
The villa is free now.
If you're interested, I'll get you a good deal.
- Who owns it?
- Me.
But I don't know what to do with it.
I often rent it out to cinema people.
Cinema people?
For the past two years,
it's been taken by the engineer
who does the lift
that takes me up to my house.
He's really nice, that boy.
He can do anything.
There's nothing he can't fix.
And he's always kissing me.
Bringing me flowers.
The Paris Express is now arriving
at platform 7.
The Berlin-Prague Blue Arrow
is running 40 minutes late
Come in, sir.
We furnished it exactly as you requested.
And tomorrow, your trunks will be delivered.
And later, I'll pass by
with a copy of your contract.
If there's anything else,
please don't hesitate to call.
Oh, Virgil.
If anything should ever happen to us,
I want you to know that I do love you.
Are you on your own, sir?
No. I'm waiting for someone.
