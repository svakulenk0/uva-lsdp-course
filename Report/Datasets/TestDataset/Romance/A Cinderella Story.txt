once upon a time, in a faraway kingdom,
lived a beautiful little girl...
...and her widowed father.
Its beautifuI.
okay. It wasn`t that long ago.
And it wasn`t really a faraway kingdom.
It was the San Fernando Valley.
It looked faraway...
...because you barely see it
through the smog.
But to me, growing up,
the Valley was my kingdom.
I was my dad`s best friend.
And he was mine.
Being raised by a man put me behind in
the makeup and fashion departments.
But I never felt like I missed out
on anything.
I was the luckiest girl in the world.
My dad owned the coolest diner.
I loved hanging out there.
Diet was a four-letter word here...
...and grease came
at no additional charge.
At Hal`s, everyone felt like family.
Oh. yeah. I have drinks.
Happy birthday!
Make a wish. princess.
What did I need a wish for?
I had amazing friends and the coolest dad.
But I guess my dad thought I needed
one more thing: Fiona.
I am so sorry.
You Iook beautifuI. Fiona.
Hey. HaI!
Along with my new stepmother came
her twin daughters, Brianna and Gabriella.
My out-of-step-sisters.
But as long as my dad was happy, so was I.
We were going to be one big, happy family.
cheese.
Ones enough.
Unfortunately, this was no fairy tale.
创He took her hand. and he kissed it.
Then he swooped her up onto
his horse.
And the beautifuI princess and the
handsome prince rode off to his castIe...
...where they Iived happiIy ever after.创
Do fairy taIes come true. Dad?
WeII. no. But dreams come true.
-Do you have a dream?
-Yeah.
My dream is that youII grow up
and go to coIIege...
...and then maybe someday youII buiId
your own castIe.
Where do princesses go to coIIege?
They go...
...where the princes go.
They go to Princeton.
But. Sam. you know. fairy taIes arent
just about finding handsome princes.
Theyre about fuIfiIIing your dreams...
...and about standing up for what
you beIieve in.
As I aIways say. never Iet the
fear of striking out--
-Keep you from pIaying the game.
-Right.
just remember. if you Iook carefuIIy.
this book contains important things...
...that you may need to know
Iater in Iife.
-Earthquake.
-My kingdom crumbled...
...during the Northridge earthquake.
HeIp! HeIp!
-Dont go.
-III be right back.
I lost my best friend that day.
From then on, the only fairy tales
in my life...
...were the ones I read about in books.
Since my father didn`t leave a will,
my stepmother got everything.
The house, the diner,
and to her dismay, me.

Then I think of you.
Hey, Nomad, do you think

I don`t know. our school

Well, that narrows it down.
Well, at least I can eliminate the guys.
You`re not a guy, right? Because if you are,
I`ll kick your butt.
I am not a guy.
Have you told your dad

Well, I think we broke our record.
-We should turn in. Sweet dreams.

Bonjour, Fighting Frogs.
Here`s your daily drought reminder:
Don`t hose your lawn, your car,
or anybody else, for that matter.
And remember, tickets
for the big game go on sale....
And then she toId us that she was
going to try to steaI...
...Austin away from you
if that was the Iast thing she did.
Our stepsister has aIways been
jeaIous of you.
Go on.
WeII. thats when she invented
this whoIe cindereIIa pIot.
She got ahoId of Austins
e-maiI address...
...and thats when she
started the whoIe affair.
We wanted to teII you sooner.
but she threatened to kiII us.
Shes such a monster.
Look. if you dont beIieve us.
Iook at the e-maiIs.
She goes by Princeton GirI 81 8.
but her reaI name is Sam Montgomery.
And were Brianna and GabrieIIa.
So that IittIe boyfriend steaIer
thinks she can puII a fast one on me?
WeII. weII just see about that.
Austin was reaIIy Iate today and asked me
if youd read this announcement.
创cindereIIa...
...if you`re listening, your prince wants to
rendezvous with you after the pep rally. ``
Nothing like a pep rally
to warm up our prince.
carter! I taIked to him.
And not as cindereIIa.
I taIked to him as me. Sam.
and he didnt hate me.
So you toId him everything?
No. not everything. Not the part
about me being cindereIIa.
But Im gonna go teII him right after
the pep raIIy. You coming. cowboy?
-So you think I Iook Iike a reaI cowboy?
-Sure.
-Who we gonna beat?
-The Lancers!
-And when we gonna beat them?
-Friday!
Good news. I just got off
the phone with Hank coIe.
You pIay weII on Friday. and your future
is set at USc footbaII.
Thats great. Dad.
And whos gonna Iead us to victory?
-Austin!
-I cant hear you!
-KiII the Lancers!
-Austin!
The cheerIeaders have put together
a skit to heIp get us in the spirit.
I Iove you. SheIby!
Thank you.
创Once upon a time. there was
a big. strong Fighting Frog.
He had a beautifuI girIfriend. and his dad
owned the biggest pond in aII the Iand.
But he stiII wasnt happy.
If onIy he can find a princess.
then she couId kiss him...
...turn him into a prince.
and they wouId run away together.
One night. after the sIimy frog
ditches his super-hot...
...senior-poII-most-popuIar girIfriend.
he meets his princess.创
Your highness.
创AIas. it turned out that our frog
not onIy had a secret identity...
...but aIso had a secret e-maiI reIationship
with a pen paI named Princeton GirI.创
This isnt good.
Dear Princeton GirI. I cant wait
tiII we finaIIy get to meet.
Youre the onIy one
who understands the reaI me.
The man who doesnt want
to pIay USc footbaII.
But who wants to be at Princeton.
with you.
-What are they taIking about?
-Nothing.
Dear Nomad. I want you to know
who I am. but Im scared!
Im scared that youII reject me.
And Ive never had a reaI kiss before.
-I cant beIieve theyre reading my e-maiIs.
-Lets go.
But our princess had a secret too.
She wasnt royaIty at aII. but a geek.
a Ioser. a servant girI.
Yeah!
Any ideas about this?
And who. may you ask. is this imposter?
Give it up for the pretend princess.
diner girI. Sam Montgomery!
Diner girl! Diner girl!
Diner girl! Diner girl!
come on.
-Sam!
-Go away!
But. Sam. youve got a Ietter
from Princeton.
What does it say?
I didnt get in.
Oh. no!
And you studied so hard.
I cant beIieve I actuaIIy thought
I had a chance.
Sam. Im heartbroken.
Life can be so unfair.
WeII. just Iook at the bright side.
You have a job at the diner
for the rest of your Iife.
You want a cookie?
Theyre so moist.
PeopIe Iike her dont beIong

Sam. what are you doing?
Im trying to get these fIoors cIean.

And you gotta have faith in yourseIf.
Mother!
-Sam just ruined your waII.
-What?
Yes. you did. WeII. thats gonna come
out of your paycheck.
And cover up those stupid words.
创Never Iet the fear of striking out

AII right. Im going off to

Excuse me?
You heard me. I quit.
I quit this job. I quit your famiIy.

Oh. and where are you gonna Iive?
With me.
You cant just waIk out on me.
You know what. Fiona?
You can mess with your hair.
your nose and your face...
...and you can even mess
with my dads diner.
But youre through messing with me.
Wait up. Sam.
You take one more step. and youre fired.
Oh. no. that wont be necessary.
because I quit too. And you know what?
The onIy reason why I put up with
you aII these years is because of that girI.
Now that shes free of you. nothing
is stopping me from kicking your butt.
come on. no. Not my face. Its much
newer than the girIs. Go for the girIs!
-Mom!
-Rhonda? Rhonda!
Shes not even worth it.
-Youre right.
-You know what? I quit too.
Me too. Hey. Rhonda. EIeanor.
HoId up. I need a ride.
See you.
WeII....
See you.
Send me a biII.
Fiona actuaIIy thought
you were gonna sIug her.
I was gonna do more than that.
I had no idea that you were that tough.
Yeah. but I aIways knew that you were.
Rhonda...
...are you sure that this is okay?
Sam. I wouIdnt have it any other way.
I havent feIt this much at home
in such a Iong time.
Im sure. compared

-Whats on your mind?
-I gotta do something tonight.
Dont wait up for me. okay?
Welcome to the start of tonight`s game

-Okay. I know you think Im just some--
-coward? Phony?
-Okay. just Iisten.
-No. you Iisten.
You turned out to be exactIy
who I thought you were.
I never pretended to be somebody eIse.
Its been me aII aIong.
And it was me who was hurt
in front of everybody.
Look. I didnt come here
to yeII at you. okay?
I came to teII you I know what it feeIs
Iike to be afraid to show who you are.
I was. But Im not anymore.
And the thing is. I dont care
what peopIe think about me...
...because I beIieve in myseIf.
And I know that things are gonna be okay.
But even though I have no famiIy
and no job and no money for coIIege...
...its you that I feeI sorry for.
-Heads up. Yo. five minutes.
-Im coming.
I know that guy that sent those e-maiIs
is somewhere down inside of you.
But I cant wait for him...
...because waiting for you is Iike
waiting for rain in this drought.
UseIess and disappointing.
Sam.
-Sam.
-Hey. What are you doing here?
Rhonda toId me where you might be. I
thought you couId use a friend. come here.
Sam. Im so proud of you.

-MyseIf.
-I think its your best Iook.
Thank you.
Come on, everybody. Weren`t they great?
Let`s hear it for them.
Let`s give our cheerleaders a big hand.
Make some noise.
Austin and I are aImost back together.
It isnt officiaI or anything. but its on.
-Sorry. guys.
-Sorry.

Here they come!
Im gIad you came. Sam.
The defending regional conference
champions, your very own Fighting Frogs!
Both the Lancers and the Frogs

...tied for the lead in the

The winner of tonight`s game will advance

You stay focused and win it.
-Everyone is counting on you. AII right?

The clock is stopped with nine seconds
left in the game.
-The Frogs need one touchdown to win.
-I Iove footbaII! I Iove footbaII!
I Iove footbaII!
Austin! Austin! Austin!
Austin! Austin!
carter. I thought that I couId handIe this.
but I reaIIy cant. Im gonna go.
You know what? III teII you
how it ends. okay?
-come on!
-Do it. baby!
This is the one. This is the one. Austin.
This is the one.
-Sorry. boys.
-Where are you going?
Whats he--? What is he--?
Whats the probIem?
-What are you doing?
-Im out of here.
What? Youre throwing away your dream!
No. Dad. Im throwing away yours.
Its your game now. Go get them.
Substituting for Ames is number 23,
Ryan Henson.
-Austin!
-Austin! Get back here!
Austin. what are you doing?
Something I shouIdve done
a Iong time ago.
Sorry I waited for the rain.
Its okay.
No!
Oh. my God.
Touchdown! The Fighting Frogs have won.
They`ve done it. They won the game.
Oh. my.... You gotta
Iove high schooI.
So we won the big game that day.
But what I remember most
was I got my prince.
And a really bad cold.
After that, it was like everything
fell into place.
My dad was right. The fairy tale book
did contain something important.
Take this one and take the
two cars in the front.
I can pay for those parking tickets!
ActuaIIy. Im seIIing your cars. Fiona.
For coIIege tuition money.
What gives you the idea
you can seII our cars?
-She owns them.
-ExactIy. I own them.
Im the county district attorney.
Have you ever seen this before?
Ive never seen that before.
Isnt this your signature
on the witness Iine?
I have never seen my
husbands hidden wiII before.
Im afraid youre gonna have to come
downtown with me. maam.
That hidden will stated that the house,
the diner and everything belonged to me.
It turned out my stepsisters knew where
Fiona had filed my real acceptance letter.
I got it!
My dad`s diner was restored
to its former glory.
And my stepmother
made a deal with the DA.
She`s working off her debt
to society at Hal`s...
...under the watchful eye
of my new partner.
And my stepsisters? They finally put
their teamwork to good use.
Austin`s dad finally came around
and got off his Trojan horse.
Things even cleared up for Carter.
Anything is possibIe if you just beIieve.
He ended up filming a commercial.
And in addition to
landing that commercial...
...Carter also landed the girl.
The San Fernando Valley
was clear and beautiful...
...the way it only is after a big rainstorm.
As for Austin and me, well,
I finally got my cell phone back.
We wound up going to Princeton together
and lived happily ever after.
At least for now.
Hey, I`m only a freshman.
