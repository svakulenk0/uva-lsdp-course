# Blue Moon #
# You saw me standing alone #
# Without a dream in my heart #
# Without a love of my own #
# Blue moon #
# You knewjust what I was there for #
# You heard me saying a prayer for #
# Someone I really could care for #
# And then there suddenly
appeared before me #
# The only one my arms
will ever hold #
# I heard somebody whisper
Please adore me #
# And when I looked
the moon had turned to gold #
# Blue moon #
# Now I'm no longer alone #
# Without a dream in my heart #
# Without a love of my own #
# And then there suddenly
appeared before me #
# The only one my arms will ever hold #
# I heard somebody whisper
Please adore me #
# And when I looked

That's East Proctor, and all about 'ere
are t'moors. I go this way.
Thanks for the ride, sir.
You have lovely sheep.
Boys, keep off the moors. Stick to
the roads, and the best of luck.
Thanks again. I'm gonna miss you.
Bye, girls.
- Are you cold?
- Yeah.
Good.
- Jack!
- David.
- You're not havin' a good time, are ya?
- Oh, I don't know. I mean, look around.
Isn't this a fun place?
- Well, I like it here.
- Right.
- Northern England first. Italy later.
- Right.
- I mean, we've got three months.
- Right.
Those sheep shit on my pack.
You think she'll meet me in Rome?
I think Debbie Klein's a mediocre person
with a good body.
There's nothin' mediocre
about Debbie Klein's body.
She's a jerk.
You're talkin' about the woman I love.
I'm talkin' about a girl you
wanna fuck. So gimme a break?
Well... I have to make love to her.
It's really very simple.
She has no choice.
It just fascinates me how much energy
you spend on somebody so dull.
There's nothin' dull about that body.
We've known Debbie, what?
Since the eighth grade?
How many years of foreplay is that?
She says she likes me too much.
What are you worried about
Debbie Klein for, anyway?
There are gonna be plenty
of girls on this trip.
Yeah, we're off to a great start.
- Say "knock, knock".
- Knock, knock.
- Who's there?
- Who?
- Don't you get it?
- What?
You don't get that joke?
All right, I'll try another.
- Say "knock, knock".
- What?
- Say "knock, knock".
- Who's there?
- No, no, no. You say "knock, knock".
- Knock, knock.
- Who's there?
- Who?
- No...
-
You're right, it is a pub.
Whaddaya say we go in
for a little food? Drink? Rest?
"The Slaughtered Lamb"?
That's kinda strange.
- Where's the lamb?
- Probably inside getting cold. Come on.
No, really. What kinda ad
is that for a pub?
I don't know.
Would you rather the Hilton?
All right. But, whatever happens,
it's your fault.
Hello.
Hi.
Nice to see you.
It's very cold outside.
May we come in?
- Yes, do you have any hot soup?
- No.
- Do you have any coffee, then?
- No.
Do you have any, uh, hot chocolate?
We've spirits and beers. If it's something
hot you want, then you can have tea.
- Then you have tea.
- No.
- Oh.
- But I can make some for you, if you like.
Oh, yes, please.
- Nice-lookin' group.
- At least it's warm in here.
Look at that.
- What about it?
- It's a five-pointed star.
Maybe the owners are from Texas.
- Remember the Alamo.
- I beg your pardon?
- Oh, he was just joking.
- Joking?
I remember The Alamo. I saw it once
in London, in Leicester Square.
She means in the cinema...
that film with John Wayne.
Oh, yeah, of course.
Checkmate.
Right. With Laurence Harvey.
Everybody dies in it. Very bloody.
Bloody awful if you ask me.
'Ere, Gladys, Tom.
Did you hear the one about that...?
Let me speak!
- Ask him what the candles are for.
- You ask him.
All right, then, I shan't tell it.
No, no, you've had your chance.
It's a pentangle, a five-pointed star.
It's used in witchcraft.
Lon Chaney Jr at Universal Studios
said that's the mark of the Wolf Man.
And you want me to ask them if they're
burning candles to ward off monsters.
- Right.
- Wrong.
All right, then!
There was this aeroplane...
..over the Atlantic
on its way to New York,...
..and it was full of men
from the United Nations.
- Go on, ask him.
- You ask him.
So halfway over the ocean
the engines run low on petrol.
So they have to lighten the plane.
So they heave out all the baggage,
but it's still too heavy.
So they chuck out all the seats,
but it's still too heavy.
Finally, this Frog, he steps up, shouts
"Vive la France", and leaps out.
Then an Englishman, he steps up, shouts
"God save the Queen", and he leaps out.
But the plane is still too heavy.
So the Yank delegate,
from Texas, he steps up, shouts:
"Remember the Alamo",
and chucks out the Mexican!
Remember the Alamo.
Excuse me.
What's that star on the wall for?
You... made me miss.
Sorry.
I've never missed that board before.
- Jack, we'd better go.
- Are you kidding? I'm starved.
There's no food 'ere.
- Shall we go, Jack?
- Apparently so.
- You can't let them go.
- How much do we owe you?
Nothing, lads.
Go. God be with you.
Uh, thank you.
Wait! You just can't let them go.
Go. Stay on the road.
Keep clear of the moors.
Thank you.
Beware the moon, lads.
Yeah.
- What the hell was that all about?
- I don't know.
Let's go up the road and see if
there's an inn or somethin'.
- "Beware the moon"?
- Yeah, Jack, but come on. I'm freezing.
- Where the hell are we going?
- Away from The Slaughtered Lamb.
Where to now, Kessler?
The Duck's Breath?
Look, I'm sorry. I'm sure
we'll find something else.
Weird fuckin' place.
It was, man.
But, boy, they could play darts.
You can't let them go.
Should the world know our business?
- It's murder, then!
- Then murder it is.
It's in God's hands now.
- What do you think was wrong?
- I have no idea.
Maybe that pentangle
was for something supernatural.
Oh, I see.
And they were too embarrassed to talk
about it because they just felt so silly.
- They were ashamed.
- Yeah.
Please, don't rain!
Oh, of course.
Oh, David...
Yes, I'm well aware of how pleasant the
weather is in Rome at the present time.
# Santa Lucia #
# Santa Lucia #
# Santa Lucia #
# Santa Lucia #
It's-a cold and-a wet out here!
Perhaps they'll be safe in the rain.
No one brought them 'ere.
No one wanted them 'ere.
-  You could've told them.
- Are you daft?
And what do you think they'd say?
They'd think us mad.
Listen.
Do you hear it?
We must go to them.
I heard nothing.
Nor I.
Did you hear that?
- I heard that.
- What was it?
Could be a lot of things.
Yeah?
- A coyote.
- There aren't any coyotes in England.
- The hound of the Baskervilles?
- Pecos Bill?
- Heathcliff.
- Heathcliff didn't howl.
No, but he was on the moors.
It's a full moon.
-  Beware the moon.
- And stick to the road.
Oops.
I vote we go back
to The Slaughtered Lamb.
Yeah.
Hey, wait a minute. We're lost.
-
- Ah, shit, David. What is that?
- I don't know. Come on.
- Come on where?
Anywhere. I think we should
just keep moving.
It's moving.
It's circling us.
Ah, fuck.
- What's the plan?
- Plan?
Let's just keep walkin'.
That's right.
A lovely stroll on the moors.
# Tra-la-la-la-la #
Isn't this fun?
It's in front of us.
Do you think it's a dog?
Oh, shit. What is it?
It's a sheepdog or somethin'.
Come on. Turn slowly. Let's walk away.
Nice doggie. Good boy.
Come on, Jack. Walk away.
Walking away. Yes.
Here we are, walking away.
- Can you see anything?
- No.
- Sounds far away.
- Not far enough. Come on.
But, Jack, where are we going?
- I'll tell you when we get there.
- OK, cos... Arghhh!
You really scared me, you shithead.
You gonna help me up or what?
Jesus! Jesus! Fuck!
Jesus! Fuck! Oh, God! Help! Help!
Jack...
Jack...
Jack?
Mr Kessler?
Mr Kessler?
I'm going to look into your eyes.
- Is he all right?
- Yes, I should think.
He called out just now.
He's American. Dr Hirsch is gonna fetch
one of them embassy fellas to see him.
- His chart says he's from New York.
- I think he's a Jew.
- What makes you say that?
- I've had a look.
Really, Susan,
that wasn't very proper.
Besides, it's common practice now.
Nurse Gallagher,
Nurse Price is quite right.
Dr Hirsch,
Mr Kessler called out just now.
Nurse Gallagher, surely you perform
some function here at the hospital?
- Yes, Doctor.
- Then get on with it.
Yes, Doctor.
Can I be of service, Nurse Price?
- Dr Hirsch?
- Go about your duties.
Yes, Doctor.
- Oh, Nurse Price.
- Yes, Doctor?
- What exactly did he call out?
- He said "Jack".
That would be Jack Goodman,
the boy who was killed.
What happened to them?
The police report said they were
attacked by an escaped lunatic.
Must've been a very powerful man.
Although I don't see that it's
any concern of yours, Nurse Price.
No, sir. Of course, sir.
Good day, Doctor.
Hello, David.
I'm Dr Hirsch. This is a countryman
of yours - Mr Collins.
- Where am I?
- You're in hospital in London.
London?
Where's Jack?
David, I'd like you to prepare yourself.
Your friend is dead.
What?
Ow. Shit.
Jack is dead?
Hi. I'm Mr Collins of the American
Embassy here in Grosvenor Square.
Mr Goodman's parents and your parents
have been notified of your injuries,...
..and everything's in order.
Who are you people?
What's goin' on here? Where's Jack?
Get your hands off me.
- Let go of me. I wanna see Jack!
- Nurse!
- I wanna see Jack.
- Mr Kessler!
I appreciate how upsetting this must
be for you. Please, Mr Kessler!
Twenty milligrams... IV, please.
I appreciate how upset you are,
but this is no reason for hysterics.
Mr Kessler? Mr Kessler,
try not to excite yourself.
I shall check on your progress and
send a report to your parents.
The police have requested
to interview you.
I have given them
permission to do so.
Thank you very much,
Mr Collins. He'll rest now.
I'm sure everything
will be fine once he's adjusted.
He's had quite a shock.
These dumb-ass kids. They never
appreciate anything you do for 'em.
How long have I been here?
You've been unconscious since
you were brought in three weeks ago.
- Three weeks?
- You've suffered some cuts and bruises.
Lost a little blood. Nothing serious.
Black and blue for a while.
You'll have some duelling scars
to boast of.
That lunatic must've been a fierce fellow.
They say a madman has
the strength of ten.
Lunatic?
We've given you
a strong sedative. Rest now.
Nurse Price will see to
all your needs. You rest.
- It wasn't a lunatic.
- I beg your pardon?
- It was an animal.
- What?
A wolf.
Did he say a wolf?
Yes... I believe he did.
Oh, I'm sure I shall.
If I survived Rommel, I can survive
an excruciating evening with Matheson.
Be a good girl. Bye, now.
Yes?
Inspector Villiers and Sergeant
McManus are here to see you, Doctor.
Send them in.
- Dr Hirsch.
- Come in. Come in. Please sit down.
- Some tea?
- No, thank you.
I'd like some tea, please.
Uh, maybe not. No, thanks. Maybe later.
- No problem.
- No, thank you, Doctor.
Well, then, what can I do
for Scotland Yard?
We understand the Kessler boy
has regained consciousness.
Uh, sorry. Sorry.
Has Mr Kessler said anything
regarding the attack on the moors?
-
- Excuse me. Yes?
- Roger Matheson, Doctor.
- I'm not here.
He's on the telephone.
Tell him I'm out. Tell him I've
passed away - an old war wound.
Just tell him I'm dead!
And no more calls.
I'm sorry if I conflict
with your report, Inspector,...
..but Jack and I were not
attacked by a man!
- Hmm. So you've said.
- He may have a point, sir.
Two strong boys would be able to defend
themselves against one man.
Sergeant McManus,...
..are you suggesting that David and Jack
were attacked by some animal,...
..and that the officialdom of East Proctor
has conspired to keep it a secret?
We've an autopsy report on the murderer,
shot in the act by the local police.
We have two witnesses to the crime.
You'll forgive me, Mr Kessler,
if I consider your testimony...
..as coming from someone who
has gone through a terrible shock.
Inspector, the boy seems
all right to me, and...
And what, Sergeant?
- And I don't rightly know, sir.
- That is precisely my point.
David, as far as we're concerned,
the matter is now closed.
We will trouble you no further.
Good day. Doctor.
- There were witnesses?
- So they said.
How could there have been witnesses?
It was so dark.
We were running, and I fell.
Jack went to help me,
and this thing came from nowhere.
I don't know what they're talkin' about.
In time I'm sure
it'll all come back to you.
Doctor, my memory is fine. It's my sanity
I'm beginning to worry about.
- Hello, Benjamin.
- No.
- No what?
- No.
Well, all right, then, be like that.
Here. Swallow this.
Want some water?
- Feeling better?
- No!
What a lot of lovely comics
you've got.
- Do you like them?
- No.
Right.
How's the patient in 21?
- Yes, yes, yes.
- How did he look?
What do you mean?
Does he seem depressed?
Will he eat his food?
I am an orderly, not a bleeding
psychiatrist. I push things around.
- What happens then I don't know.
- Thank you.
- Mr Kessler.
- Yes?
- You haven't eaten your lunch.
- Well, I'm not very hungry, thank you.
- I'm afraid you have to eat something.
- What?
You have to eat something.
No, really. Thanks. I'm not hungry.
You put me in an awkward position,
Mr Kessler.
How'd I do that?
You're to take these after you've eaten.
What sort of nurse would I be if I failed
in so simple a task as handing out pills?
- Leave the pills. I'll take them later.
- Sorry.
- Aw, come on, Nurse Price.
- You can call me Alex.
Come on, Alex.
Shall I be forced
to feed you, Mr Kessler?
You can call me David.
Shall I be forced to feed you, David?
This is absurd. I'm not hungry.
I don't want any food.
Right.
Let's try a little harder, shall we?
Would you gimme a break?
Will I have to take such drastic
action again, David?
You've never had bad dreams before?
Sure, as a kid, but never so real.
Never so weird.
Did you get a good look
at the man who attacked you?
Doctor, I told you. It wasn't a man.
It was an animal.
A big wolf or something.
- A rabid dog.
- Let's have a look, shall we?
Dr Hirsch, I know I was traumatised,
but Jack was torn apart.
I saw him. A man can't do that
to someone with his bare hands.
You'd be surprised what horrors
a man is capable of.
- Did you see Jack?
- No.
In fact, your wounds had been dressed
before you arrived here.
Did you talk to the police
in East Proctor?
Did the cops go to
The Slaughtered Lamb?
I really don't know.
Then why the hell are you
so quick to disbelieve me?
- You think I'm crazy.
- David, please. The police are satisfied.
And if there were a monster roaming
around, we'd have seen it on the telly.
You'll be leaving this hospital in three
or four days. Please, remain sane.
At least until you're
no longer our responsibility.
Dr Hirsch.
I'd rather not be by myself.
I'll send someone in
to keep you company.
You're a very beautiful girl.
I thought you were asleep.
I was.
Shall I read to you?
Yeah, OK.
A Connecticut Yankee
at King Arthur's Court.
By Samuel L Clemens.
This is after the preface
but before chapter one:
"A Word of Explanation."
"It was in Warwick Castle that I came
across the curious stranger...
..who I'm going to talk about."
"He attracted me by three things:
his candid simplicity,...
..his marvellous familiarity
with ancient armour,...
..and the restfulness of his company,
for he did all the talking."
"We fell together,
as modest people will,...
..in the tail of the herd
that was being shown through,...
..and he at once began to say things
which interested me."
Puppetry is an art form, Piggy.
- You call that violence "art"?
- Well, violence belongs with puppetry.
He is hitting her.
That's Punch andJudy.
They've always been violent.
- Punch andJudy?
- It's a good, aggressive behaviour.
Better than my act?
I was going to bite you
very badly.
- Get the door!
-
I'll get it.
All right, all right.
Hold your horses.
-
- All right, already.
Stop!
Ladies and gentlemen...
Hello. Have you been up long?
I've just had a nightmare.
Not to worry. I've just the thing.
Alex!
Holy shit.
Ah, you're up? Good morning,
and a good day to you.
We have quite a meal here
for you: bacon and eggs,...
..porridge, orange juice,
and toast and jam.
Good stuff there. You eat it up, and I'll
be back for the dishes when you finish.
Good morning.
Can I have a piece of toast?
Get the fuck outta here, Jack.
Thanks a lot.
No. I can't take this.
Am I asleep now, or awake or what?
I realise I don't look so hot, David,...
..but I thought you'd be glad to see me.
David! You're hurting my feelings.
Hurting your feelings?
Has it occurred to you
that it might be unsettling...
..to see you rise from the grave
to visit me?
Sorry to be upsetting you,
David, but I had to come.
Aren't you supposed to be
buried someplace in New York?
Yeah. Your parents came to my funeral.
I was surprised at how many came.
Why should you be surprised?
You were a well-liked person.
- Yeah. I was, wasn't I?
- Well, I liked you.
Debbie Klein cried a lot.
Am I asleep now or what?
So you know what she does?
She's so grief-stricken she runs to find
solace in Mark Levine's bed.
Mark Levine?
An asshole.
Life mocks me even in death.
I'm going completely crazy.
David!
What?
I'm really sorry to be upsetting you,
but I have to warn you.
- Warn me?
- We were attacked by a werewolf.
- I'm not listening to this.
- On the moors.
We were attacked by a lycanthrope.
A werewolf.
I was murdered.
An unnatural death.
And now I walk the earth in limbo
until the werewolf's curse is lifted.
- Shut up.
- The wolf's bloodline must be severed.
The last remaining werewolf
must be destroyed.
It's you, David.
What?
Please believe me. You'll kill people.
- Nurse!
- Listen to me!
Nurse!
The supernatural, the power
of darkness... it's all true.
The undead surround me.
Have you ever talked to a corpse?
It's boring.
I'm lonely.
Take your life, David.
Kill yourself,...
..before you kill others.
Please don't cry.
Beware the moon, David.
David... David!
David, what's wrong?
I'm a werewolf.
A werewolf?
Are you all right now?
I don't know. I'll let you know
the next full moon.
David, you're going to be discharged
tomorrow. Will you be all right?
My friend Jack was just here.
- Your dead friend Jack?
- Yes.
He told me that... I will become
a monster in two days.
What do you think?
What do I think?
About the possibility of you becoming
a monster in two days, or...
..about visits from dead friends?
I was dreaming again?
Yes, I would think so.
I think so too.
Do you have somewhere
to stay in London?
Remember, I'm just a working girl,
so don't expect too much.
- Do you live by yourself?
- Yes.
Good.
There's a shop on the corner.
We'll get some food.
This stuff's expensive.
It's outrageous. My pay can't possibly
keep up with inflation.
How do you live?
Carefully.
This is the, uh... living room.
- You mind if I get rid of this?
- Oh, please.
- The kitchen.
- Very nice.
Closet.
Charming.
The bathroom.
Lovely.
The bedroom.
There's only one bed.
I'll be perfectly honest
with you, David.
I'm not in the habit of bringing home
stray, young American men.
I should hope not.
I find you very attractive,...
..and a little bit sad.
Go on.
I've had seven lovers in my life,
three of which were one-night stands.
I don't know what I'm trying to say.
Perhaps you'd like to watch telly
whilst I take a shower.
# Well, it's a marvellous night
for a Moondance #
# With the stars up above
in your eyes #
# A fantabulous night
to make romance #
# 'Neath the cover
of October skies #
# And all the leaves
on the trees are falling #
# To the sound
of the breezes that blow #
# And I'm trying to please
to the calling #
# Of your heartstrings
that play soft and low #
# And all the night's magic
seems to whisper and hush #
# And all the soft moonlight
seems to shine #
# In your blush #
# Can I just have
one more Moondance with you #
# My love #
# Can I just make
some more romance with you #
# My love #
Arghh!
You're not real.
Don't be a putz, David.
Come here.
A nurse, huh?
Shh.
Come on.
What are you doing here?
I wanted to see you.
-  Hi, David.
- Put that down.
OK, you've seen me. Now go away.
I'm sorry I'm upsetting you, David, but
you don't understand what's goin' on.
I understand all right.
You're one of the "undead",
and I'm a werewolf.
Yes. That's right.
Get outta here, Jack.
Tomorrow night's the full moon.
You're gonna change. You'll become...
I know. I know. A monster.
You've gotta kill yourself,
David, before it's too late.
Are you really dead, Jack?
- What do you think?
- I think I've lost my mind.
I think you're not real. I think you're just
another part of a bad dream.
You've gotta believe me, David.
Believe what? That tomorrow night
beneath the full moon...
..I'll sprout hair and fangs
and eat people?
- Bullshit!
- Goddamn it, David, please believe me.
You'll kill and make others like me.
I'm not havin' a nice time here.
You've gotta take your own life.
I will not accept this. Go away.
David?
This is not pretend, David.
I will not be threatened
by a walking meat loaf!
David...
What's wrong? I heard voices.
It was just me, Alex.
Just me being crazy.
Are you all right?
No, I don't think so.
Come back to bed now.
Do I seem crazy to you?
David, what is the matter?
I just saw Jack again.
Where? Here?
Yeah.
What did he say?
He said that tomorrow
I'll turn into a monster.
Do you believe him?
Do you believe me?
I believe that you're very upset.
I believe that you loved him very much
and you blame yourself for his death.
Did you ever see The Wolf Man?
- Is that the one with Oliver Reed?
- No, the old one.
I don't think so.
Bela Lugosi bites Lon Chaney Jr
and he turns into a werewolf.
- Why are you telling me this?
- No, listen.
Claude Rains is Lon Chaney's father,
and he ends up killing him.
So?
Well, I think that a werewolf can only be
killed by someone who loves them.
What are you talking about?
I don't know what I'm talkin' about.
I'm torn between feeling
very sorry for you...
..and finding you terribly attractive.
A drink for a very cold man.
- Good afternoon. What can I get you?
- Uh...
- A Campari soda would do very nice.
- Sorry, love.
Oh, well then, uh,
a small Guinness will suffice.
Nasty business with those two young
American boys, wasn't it?
- I don't know what you mean, sir.
- Yes, I'm sure I'm right.
A few weeks back.
Last full moon, wasn't it?
I mean, the escaped lunatic,
the one who killed the boy.
A thousand thanks, madam.
Well, that was round here, wasn't it?
Where are you from, sir?
London.
Excuse me.
Knight takes pawn, hm?
What?
Oh. Yeah.
Cheers.
What's that?
Oh, that's, uh...
been there for 200 years, sir.
We were going to paint it out,
but it's traditional, so we left it.
I see.
So, you've heard nothing of this incident?
- Incident?
- The murder.
- You a police officer?
- Oh, good Lord, no.
I'm a doctor. I work in the hospital
where they brought the Kessler boy.
He was talking about werewolves.
Monsters.
I was in the area, so I thought...
You thought what?
I thought I'd look
into the boy's story.
Story about werewolves?
Really, sir.
Like a game?
- Well?
- I think not.
- Surely I'm not that impressive.
- No. No, sir, you're not.
I don't feel like a game.
- You off now?
- Aye. I'll not be long.
- I just wanna check on the dogs.
- Dogs are fine.
I'll just check.
Quite a long drive to London.
Do you have anything to eat?
No. There's no food here.
There's nothing for you 'ere, sir.
Well,...
..I'll be on my way, then.
Hello.
Listen. That boy's in danger.
I mean,...
..it were a mistake...
to let him leave 'ere.
There's something wrong
with this place.
That much I understand.
It's the one who lives.
He's the one who's in danger,
and not just him.
Others will be, too.
It's almost full moon.
He'll change, and he'll...
That's enough!
That's enough.
If you get too anxious,
call me at the hospital, OK?
OK.
- I've left those pills for you.
- A doper werewolf.
I'm off.
See ya later.
Thanks a lot, dog.
Hello?
Snarl!
Grrrowl!
Grrr!
..lost 28 pounds in less than a fortnight.
Rab Smith... neat, dapper little character.
There's a lot said about big,
gross darts players, but Rab...
Crazy girl asked me to meet
her guy before she married him,...
..and he totally blew my mind.
Nina Carter reveals her amazing life as
pop star, beauty queen and top model.
Read about her nude pictures.
The only ones I regret
were among the first.
The men in her life.
There may have been a lot,
but I don't regret one of them.
Nina tells the News of the World
how she had fun...
..and found trouble earning too much
money, getting in too much mischief.
In the end it nearly destroyed me.
Don't miss the naked truth
about naughty Nina,...
..starting in the News
of the World tomorrow.
# I see a bad moon risin' #
# I see trouble on the way #
# I see earthquakes and lightnin' #
# I see bad times today #
# Don't go round tonight #
# Well, it's bound to take your life #
# There's a bad moon on the rise #
I'm not hungry.
# I hear hurricanes a-blowin' #
# I know the end is comin' soon #
# I fear rivers overflowin' #
# I hear the voice of rage and ruin #
# Don't go round tonight #
# Well, it's bound to take your life #
# There's a bad moon on the rise #
# All right #
Fe-fi-fo-fum,
I smell the blood of an Englishman.
I'm still not hungry.
# Hope you got your things together #
# Hope you are quite prepared to die #
# Looks like we're in for nasty weather #
# One eye is taken for an eye #
# Well, don't go round tonight #
# Well, it's bound to take your life #
- How are we feeling tonight?
- No!
- No what?
- No!
Benjamin, have you ever been severely
beaten about the face and neck?
- No!
- I thought not.
Now, go to sleep. Sweet dreams...
No!
No!
# Blue moon #
# You saw me standing alone #
Jesus Christ!
What?!
God! What?!
Oh! Oh! I'm burnin' up!
# Blue moon #
# You knewjust what I was there for #
God...!
# You heard me saying a prayer for #
# Someone I really could care for #
# Then suddenly there appeared
before me #
# The only one my arms could ever hold #
# Then I heard somebody whisper
Please adore me #
# When I looked
the moon had turned to gold #
Help me!
Please, help me!
Help me!
I didn't mean to call
you a meat loaf, Jack!
That's £1.50, please.
- Which one, Harry?
- Number 39.
- Hey, let's go round the back.
- Why?
Come on. We'll give Sean a scare.
- It's freezing cold!
- Oh, come on.
You're crazy, Harry.
What are we doing?
We're going to creep up round the stairs
and give him a right old scare.
- Did you hear something?
- Just now?
- Yes.
- No.
Sean, those hooligans are
in the park again.
Aren't you ready yet?
They'll be here any minute.
There's something going on out there.
- Is Nurse Price on duty this evening?
- Yes, Doctor.
Do you know if Nurse Price has seen
the Kessler boy since his release?
I don't know.
Yes, Doctor. I have.
Come to my office, Nurse Price.
Is anyone there?
Sit down, Alex.
I was in East Proctor today.
- I'm concerned about David.
- Yes, sir.
There's a full moon.
Where is he?
- He's at my flat.
- What's the number?
- I'm off at midnight...
- Your number.
Is that you, Harry?
- No, he's not there.
- He's not?
Alex,...
..has David persisted
in his werewolf fantasies?
Dr Hirsch, what's wrong?
Is this more serious than I know?
I tried to investigate the attack.
There are no records.
Case was closed.
Now they've "misplaced" the file.
David's lacerations were dressed
before he arrived here.
Yet, supposedly, no other doctor
examined him before I did.
The Goodman boy's in the ground.
He's no use to us.
So, I went to the pub
in East Proctor today,...
..where I was convinced of two things:
They were lying. There were no
witnesses, no escaped lunatic.
The whole community is hiding
the truth of what actually happened out there.
Surely you don't mean...
David has suffered a severe trauma.
I myself witnessed some form of
mass neurosis in East Proctor.
If the villagers believe Jack Goodman
was killed by a werewolf,...
..why shouldn't David?
And if he survived
an attack by a werewolf,...
..wouldn't he himself become a werewolf
at the next full moon?
Oh, I don't mean running about on
all fours and howling at the moon,...
..but in such a deranged state he might
harm himself. Perhaps other people.
- What shall we do?
- I think we should call the police.
Here. Old Winston smells something.
Let him go!
Brave dog, that.
Here! Who's there?
That's not Winston.
Look! There!
Mary, mother of God!
Hello?
Is there someone there?
I can assure you this is
not the least bit amusing.
I shall report this.
Good Lord.
Uh, hello, wolves. Uh, nice wolves.
Um, I'm gonna, uh...
I'll be right back, OK?
Just, uh, take any calls.
Uh... Oh, boy.
No, Dr Hirsch.
He hasn't come back yet.
Yes, I will.
But I feel so helpless just
sitting around here doing nothing.
Yes, thank you.
Bye-bye.
Excuse me.
Hey, kid!
Little boy with the balloons!
Come over here!
If you come over here,
I'll give you a pound.
Two pounds.
I don't know who you are.
I'm, uh, the famous balloon thief.
Why would a thief want to
give me two pounds?
I'll explain it to you.
Thank you.
Yes, love?
A naked American man stole my balloons.
What?
Twenty pence, please, sir.
Sorry.
Lot of weather we've been having lately.
Good morning!
- I'm freezing.
- David!
Where on earth have you been?
Alex, you won't believe this.
I've lost my mind.
I woke up in the zoo.
- The zoo.
- What did I do last night?
You don't remember?
Well, I remember seeing you
to the door, and then, uh,...
..saying goodbye,
getting locked out of the flat...
Then I came in through the front window.
I started to read,...
..then I woke up naked at the zoo.
I was worried about you.
We didn't know where you were.
Where did you get that coat?
I'll get it.
- Hello?
- Alex. Have you heard anything?
- He's here.
- Is he all right? Where was he?
He doesn't remember.
He woke up at the zoo.
The zoo? Is he rational?
Yes, he is.
He's very excited and confused.
But he's not crazy,
if that's what you mean.
Have you read the papers today?
Listened to the radio or television?
- No. Why?
- Is David behaving strangely?
Uh... no, he's... Not really.
He's rather enthusiastic.
- Can you get here without any trouble?
- Yes, I should think so.
Bring David here straight away.
I want him in my care.
I'll notify the police, but it's imperative
you bring him to the hospital.
- You understand?
- Yes, Doctor.
- You're certain he's lucid?
- He's fine. We'll come right over.
- Shall I send a car?
- A taxi will be faster.
I expect you shortly.
- We should be able to get a taxi here.
- I should be committed.
Dr Hirsch will know what to do.
I haven't felt this good
in a long time.
My body feels great.
I feel like an athlete.
- Let's go back for a quickie, huh?
- Later.
Good morning!
- Get in.
- No, I just...
- St Martin's Hospital.
- Right.
Puts you in mind of the days of the old
demon barber of Fleet Street, don't it?
- Sorry?
- The murders.
- What murders?
- Haven't you heard?
Last night,...
..six of 'em.
All in different parts
of the city, all mutilated.
He must be a real right maniac,
this fella.
- Pull over.
- David, we're...
Pull over!
Pay the man.
Wait!
David!
- David, stop!
- I'm goin' to the police!
- Jack was right!
- Jack is dead!
Jack is dead.
And six people are dead.
There's a full moon tonight.
I'm goin' to the cops.
David, please be rational.
Let's go to Dr Hirsch.
Be rational, sure. I'm a fuckin' werewolf,
for Christ's sake!
- David!
- Officer!
Officer, I killed those people last night.
- You did, did you?
- He's playing a silly joke...
- You be quiet.
- We had an argument...
- I don't know this girl.
- All right, move along.
- Come on, David...
- I want you to arrest me, you asshole!
There's no call for that kind of language.
Queen Elizabeth is a man!
Prince Charles is a faggot!
- Winston Churchill was full of shit!
- That's enough.
- No! Let go of me!
- David, please!
Shakespeare's French!
Fuck! Shit! Cunt! Shit!
- Come on, that's enough.
- David, please!
- Who is this person?
- If you don't stop, I shall arrest you.
That's what I want you to do, ya moron!
- He's upset. His friend was killed.
- Shut up!
That's enough.
About your business, both of you.
You're not gonna arrest me?
- Don't you think he should arrest me?
- I don't know.
- Perhaps he thinks it's a prank.
- A prank?
- David...
- I've had enough of this foolishness.
All right, come on...
- It's hopeless. It's hopeless.
- Let's go.
Leave me alone!
You people are crazy!
- I gotta get outta here!
- David, don't lose control!
What control?
Jack was real.
He tried to warn me...
- David...
- I love you.
What?
I love you.
But I think I did some
terrible things last night...
- Let's go and see Dr Hirsch.
- You gotta stay away from me.
I can help you.
No, I'm not safe to be with.
You gotta stay away from me.
I love you, Alex.
David!
The forensic lab seemed to feel some
sort of animal was involved, that's true.
I hardly think...
Regardless of what you think, Inspector,
David is missing, and we must find him.
- Before nightfall.
- Gentlemen, please.
We shall find Mr Kessler
as quickly as we're able.
- He tried to get himself arrested.
- Getting arrested isn't that difficult.
He wants help. He really...
- How can we assist you?
- Stay here.
If we need you, we'll know
where to reach you.
I cannot accept a connection between
David Kessler and last night's murders.
We will find him, however.
I can assure you of that.
We'll find him. Not to worry.
I promise.
Yes, operator, I'd like to call the United
States and reverse the charges.
David Kessler, for anyone.
Thank you. I'll wait.
Hello? It's area code 516,...
..472 3402.
Thank you.
Hello, Rachel? Just say yes,
you'll accept the charges.
Say yes, Rachel.
Hi. Is Mom or Dad at home?
Well, where are they?
Well, where's Max?
You're all alone?
Mom and Dad would never leave me
alone when I was ten.
No, not ten and a half, either.
I'm still in London.
Yes, I'm all better now.
Listen, Rachel,...
..tell Mom and Dad
that I love them, OK?
Just do it for me, will ya, please?
And, uh,...
..don't fight with Max.
Well, try.
And please don't forget what
I told ya about Mom and Dad.
That I love them.
And I love Max,
and I love you too.
I do.
No, I'm not being silly,
ya little creep.
You promise?
OK.
- You be a good girl, then.
-
Yeah, I love you.
Goodbye.
- How much is it?
- £2.80, sir.
Hi, Jack.
Hi, David.
What are you doing 'ere? You promised
never to do this kind of thing again!
- I never promised you any such thing.
- Not you, you twit. Her.
I've never seen you before in my life.
Oh, sorry.
Good movie.
Mm-hmm.
What can I say, Jack?
Ya don't have to say anything, David.
- Aren't ya gonna say "I told ya so"?
- If I were still alive, I probably would.
But I did tell you so, you schmuck.
- You look awful.
- Thank you.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.
I don't know what I'm saying.
I don't even know if it was me that killed
those people. I don't remember doing it.
What about the zoo?
Well, even if I'm not the Wolf Man,...
..I'm crazy enough to do
somethin' like that.
Look at me - in a porno theatre
in Piccadilly Circus,...
..talking to a corpse.
I'm actually glad to see ya, Jack.
I want ya to meet some people.
David Kessler,
this is Gerald Bringsley.
Gerald's the man
you murdered on the subway.
We thought it best for you not to see
him. He's a fresh kill and pretty messy.
Yes. I do look most unpleasant.
Why are you doing this to me?
This isn't Mr Goodman's idea.
He's your good friend.
Whereas I am a victim of your
carnivorous lunar activities.
Mr Bringsley,...
..I'm sorry.
I have absolutely no idea
what to say to you.
You've left my wife a widow
and my children fatherless.
And, I understand, I am to walk the earth
in limbo - one of the living dead -
..until the wolf's bloodline is
severed and the curse lifted.
You must die, David Kessler.
David?
This is Harry Berman and his fiancée,
Judith Browns.
- Hello.
- Hello.
And these gentlemen are Alf,
Ted and Joseph.
Can't say we're pleased
to meet you, Mr Kessler.
What shall I do?
- Suicide.
- You must take your own life.
That's easy for you to say.
You're already dead.
No, David. Harry and I and everyone
you murder are not dead. The Undead.
Why are you doing this to me?
Because this must be stopped.
How shall I do it?
- Sleeping pills?
- Not sure enough.
- I could hang myself.
- No.
No, if you did it wrong it could be
painful. You'd choke to death.
So what? Let him choke!
Do you mind?
The man's a friend of mine!
- Well, he ain't no friend to me.
- Gentlemen, please.
- A gun!
- I know where you can get a gun.
- Don't I need a silver bullet, or something?
- Oh, be serious, would you?
- Madness.
- No, a gun would be good.
Put the gun to your head
and pull the trigger.
If you put it in your mouth
you'd be sure not to miss.
Thank you. You're all so thoughtful.
A knife!
- An electric shock!
- A car crash!
- Throw yourself in front of a tube.
- Drowning.
Go away.
Please, go away.
Please... run!
-
- What was that?
- I don't know!
- I'll check on the house.
Hello?
No, I'm sorry.
No, nobody of that name.
OK. Thank you. Bye.
Help! Help!
- Help!
- What's the matter?
- There's a mad thing in there!
- Where?
- A mad dog is tearing...
- Calm down!
Oh, do something!
Oh, right there. Yeah, right there.
Oh, yeah, harder. Oh, yeah.
Jesus Christ!
For Christ's sake, John, there's a monster
in there! Call for assistance!
Better bring rifles!
Will you people get out of the way!
- What the hell's going on here?
- Some kind of animal, sir.
Sister Hobbs said there's a disturbance in
Piccadilly Circus - some sort of mad dog.
David!
It's a dead end down there!
Clear this street!
David. It's David.
Alex! Alex!
- Let me through!
- Stand aside, miss!
You must let me through!
Come back!
Alex!
David? Is it you?
David.
They're going to kill you.
David...
Please...
Please let me help you.
I love you, David.
