Only a few days left.
Tickets are running out
for the big New Year's dance...
Hey, how can I help you?
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
How can I help you?
And this one goes... where?
Very well.
Now it has a face.
Well, you go next.
You still have this one.
Sort it out.
By size and...
If you anger them it's worse...
it's worse, Aurora.
Are you looking
for anything in particular?
it's not my money.
I'll wrap it up for you.
Do you want any?
Yes?
No?
Yes.
- Sure.
- Yours too.
- How about this one?
- No.
- Which one?
- That one.
You too? Yes?
A little gift,
thank you.
Thank you both.
Good luck.
No, honey,
it's not chocolate.
Something like this
just happens once in a lifetime.
Once in a lifetime.
Well...
nothing happens.
Look, how curious.
What do you think it could be?
A toy?
Don't get close to it.
Don't get scared.
Bring me a box.
Now, watch carefully,
this is seven by four.
We'll start with this leg,
Manuelito.
One, two, three, four.
- Don't push, Manuelito.
- Sorry, ma'am.
And...
Now comes the finale.
Good evening.
Where did you say you fell?
Over some broken glass.
You won't need any stitches.
Blood is so messy.
Remember when
Aunt Marge died?
Everyone was soaked in blood
and she was spotless.
But really dead.
There's something here.
It's going to hurt.
Good thing you warned me.
Almost.
It was buried deep.
What is it?
I don't know,
some sort of metal shaving.
No, it's more like a sting...
from a bee, I don't know.
Please, please, please.
Be very careful
with my soul, please.
Our Father, Who art in heaven,
hallowed be Thy name.
Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread...
I'm fine, honey.
I'm all right.
I'm all right.
- I'm reading.
- There's too much light.
It's amazing, look.
Nena Vizcalna
died at 92.
Do you like it?
- No.
- You look...
different, much younger.
Exactly, that's why I did it.
That's how I feel.
Where's Aurora?
- You don't eat breakfast?
- I'm not hungry.
Hey, do you like it or not?
- Yes, I do like it.
- Well...
that's really nice.
Hello, Mr. Gris...
How are you?
You...
destroyed my store.
You don't know what
you're getting yourself into.
Almost 40 years ago...
I found this manuscript.
They are the notes,
the hermetic annotations
of a 16th century alchemist.
It's a fascinating book
written backwards in Latin.
It talks about
a peculiar mechanism,
an invention that extends
its user's life.
But it has rules,
precise rules,
very strict,
on how to use it.
An insect?
That's the master stroke.
The insect is trapped
inside the invention.
Like a sort of...
living filter.
You believe it?
I mean, after so many years.
Who says insects aren't
God's favorite creatures?
Christ walked on water,
just like a mosquito.
The resurrection concept
is not foreign to ants,
or to spiders.
They could survive inside a rock
for hundreds of years...
until someone comes along
and sets them free.
Sure.
It's very educational, but I don't
see why you're telling me this.
I'm dying, Mr. Gris.
I'm going to show you something.
The scalpel has been
eating me alive,
little by little.
Chemotherapy, radiotherapy,
psychotherapy...
Look closely,
my friend,
half of my body is here,
inside this display case.
And the other half...
it's already in the menu.
Or it's being chewed
as we speak.
No. It's mine.
You used it?
You used it?
Just by accident.
What an imbecile.
We both lose something.
This can't be possible.
It can't be possible, damn it.
Aurora, my God.
I know you've got it.
Are you scared?
You think something
will happen to me?
Are you comfortable back there?
It already happened to me once,
with your dad.
You remember him,
at least a little?
Yes...
I believe you do.
When he was your age,
he heard something or someone
speak about those
who die of lung cancer.
So, when I came back
from work,
I found out that my cigarettes
had disappeared.
After searching all day,
I get in the bathroom
and I find a bunch
of little bits of tobacco,
floating in the toilet.
Just bits.
I think he understood
that breaking my cigars
didn't help the matter at all.
But at least it made it clear to me
that he was worried.
And it made it clear to him
that it made it clear to me.
You know...
I don't know
what's happening to me.
But I think it's better
if we stay together.
- I need you to help me.
- Just a minute.
Hurry, honey,
we'll be late.
Who are you, little one?
A god?
You're so good to me.
Woman: I don't understand why
I can't zip up this dress,
it's the same one I wore
at last year's dance.
I'm almost done.
How could I change so much
in such a short time?
Remember this?
If I remember?
No, I can't accept it's all over
That life set us apart...
If I remember?
I always think about
the first time I saw you,
how I thought you would never
pay attention to me.
I felt like
such a nobody that...
Man: That's what architects
call "vectors."
It's the little things that support
the big things.
- How are they supported?
- The fact is that the pillars...
- Teacher, can you see...?
- In a minute, Manuel.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
- Money and love.
Cheers.
- What's wrong?
- Eh?
- Is something wrong?
- No, I'll be right back.
- Where are you going?
- I'll get something to drink.
It's the heat.
It happens to me all the time.
- Is it better?
- Yeah.
Every time I drink,
I have to pee.
...since I was a kid.
What a decadent party, damn it.
Let's see, let's see...
fuck this.
Look at what they've done here.
It must have been
an Argentinean gate crasher
or some Peruvian on the loose.
Motherfucker.
I'm working my ass off
all year for a party...
Let's go.
- How beautiful...
- We're dead...
He never told you?
He thinks that will help him
to extend his life.
Do whatever you have to do,
but leave me alone.
How quiet.
All this blood, my God.
All this blood is mine.
I'm dying.
How weird.
Everything is upside down
and I'm dying...
alone.
Alone.
Don't let me die today.
Oh, it hurts so bad.
I can resist a lot longer...
a lot longer.
Oh, Aurora.
Great, Tito.
Great.
The forehead is coming out perfect.
Like nothing ever happened.
- It's your best work.
- You bet.
It has its secrets.
Here I'm giving form...
texture...
I'm giving it color...
They think I'm a fucking artist.
Yeah...
but don't work on it too hard,
we're going to cremate him.
What?
Motherfucker,
what do you mean "cremate him"?
You should have told me. I wouldn't
have dolled him up, fucker.
God, rest in peace.
It seems no one
respects my work here.
Why don't they tell me?
You, why didn't you tell me?
- Huh?
- The widow changed her mind.
It seems the guy didn't have
anything prepared.
No tomb, no grave, nothing.
They're all the same.
Eternal, the fuckers.
Look at you...
Was the wake fun?
You're not going
to heaven like that, right?
Naked...
kisses everywhere,
they'll know you were out
fucking around.
Come on, compadre.
...15 minutes ago.
Come in, this is your house.
Tito,
Mr. De la Guardia is...
was a friend of the deceased.
He wants to see the body...
one last time.
Sure,
medium or well done?
- Ohh...
Yeah?
That's for me?
Dear Mercedes...
I write this lines
with great difficulty.
I want you to know that...
somehow,
someway,
I'm still alive.
And it hurts me to be alive.
The thirst is burning me,
and I feel indifferent
about everything...
the day...
this house...
and you.
Aurora is staying with you,
she...
will leave you this letter.
By the time you read it...
I would have been gone to settle
some kind of date,
an unfinished business.
Since I lost everything,
at least I want to understand why.
Just today
I realize how much I miss you.
I hope to see you
when I come back,
and that you want to see me
no matter in what
kind of shape I am.
Loves you...
Jesus.
My God,
what are you doing here?
I told you not to come.
Put that away.
Don't you see
they could kill us?
Don't you see we're in danger?
It works?
I knew you would return.
If you're looking
for the missing pages,
you're wasting your time.
I ate them.
You talk about eternity,
look at me, look at my skin.
It's decomposing,
it's falling off piece by piece.
What are you talking about?
Look.
What's happening to me?
You've been reborn.
You talk about insects,
alchemists, artifacts.
But what is it that I need?
Blood.
Human?
I can destroy the artifact,
pulverize it.
What do I care about eternity?
I don't want to be eternal,
I just want to get out of this.
I don't trust you.
I don't see you have a choice.
Give me that, darling.
Come on, I know what I'm doing.
You first.
My way out.
My God, Aurora.
Let's go now... let's go.
Please.
Go.
Go...
Come here.
What the fuck
does it take to kill you?
You'll lose more than I will.
Mine is only pain.
Grandpa.
I'm Jesus...
Gris.
