????
HE'S DEAD.
HE'S DEAD.
I DON'T BELIEVE IT !
NO PULSE.
THERE'S NO PULSE !
NO PULSE !  NO--
YOU--
HE'S GOT NO PULSE.
A LITTLE AFTER MIDNIGHT,
THE OLD CARETAKER WAS AWAKENED
BY A TERRIBLE SOUND;
WHIMPERING, PITIFULLY.
THE SOUND CAME AGAIN,
FAINTLY.
ONLY THIS TIME
HE WAS SURE IT WAS HUMAN.
THE GRAVEYARD WAS SILENT...
EXCEPT FOR THE STEADY PADDING
OF HIS FEET...
AS HE WENT
AROUND THE TOMBSTONES.
"HELLO ?  IS SOMEONE THERE ?
SOMEONE ?"
BUT THERE WAS NOTHING.
NO ONE.
AS HE STOOD THERE,
SCRATCHING HIS HEAD,
FEELING SOMETHING
OF A DAMN FOOL,
HE HAPPENED TO LOOK DOWN.
AND THERE AT HIS FEET,
SOMEONE HAD BEEN BURIED...
THAT VERY AFTERNOON.
THE GRAVE HAD BEEN DISTURBED.
THE SOIL WAS UPSET,
AND THE CROSS LAY ON ITS SIDE.
"RESPECT," HE MUTTERED,
SURE NOW THAT HE WAS THE
BUTT OF A PRACTICAL JOKE.
SO HE SMOOTHED OUT THE SOIL...
AND SET THE CROSS BACK UPRIGHT
AT THE HEAD OF THE GRAVE,
AND THEN HE WENT BACK
TO HIS BED.
BUT OUTSIDE,
IN THE GRAVEYARD,
IN THE WIND,
THERE WAS STILL A FAINT WISP
OF SOUND,
ALMOST LIKE A SONG:
"ALIVE.  STILL ALIVE !"
AAAH !
"ALIVE."
GOD.
MARVELOUS STORY.
MARVELOUS.
I THINK THAT
WAS THE WORST SHOCKER
WE'VE HAD IN YEARS.
DAMN NEAR SCARED THE PANTS
OFF ME, I'LL TELL YOU.
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT YOU,
BUT I COULD DO
WITH ANOTHER BRANDY.
HEAR, HEAR.
MAYBE A GOOD CIGAR.
I'VE GOT TO
GO TO BED.
NO BRANDY ?
I HAVEN'T BEEN
SLEEPING WELL LATELY.
BESIDES, IT'S LATE,
AND IT'S GETTING COLD.
AND MILLY'LL BE WAITIN' UP TO--
POUR SOME HOT CHOCOLATE
DOWN ME.
COME ON.  I'LL
DRIVE YOU HOME, DOC.
YOU KNOW, TEN YEARS FROM NOW,
OF THIS COUNTRY...
WILL BE WEARING TIES
ONLY TO WEDDINGS...
AND--
AND TO FUNERALS
TOO, PERHAPS.
I'D FEEL
AS IF I WAS NAKED.
WELL, IT'S TIME
WE ALL WENT HOME.
COME ON, DOC.
YOU LOOK TERRIBLE.

I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT,
BUT SOMETHING !
HE WAS WALKING--
I HAVE ANOTHER IDEA.
WE'VE GOT TO HELP THE BOY.
YOU TALK AS IF HE WAS
I'M SURE EDWARD LEFT HIM
WELL PROVIDED FOR.
- WHY DON'T YOU TELL HIM
HOW GRATEFUL HE SHOULD BE ?
- TAKE IT EASY, NOW.
TO KNOW A MAN OVER 50 YEARS.
YOU-- YOU'D THINK YOU KNEW
WHAT HE WAS CAPABLE OF !
YOU'RE NOT DOING YOUR
BLOOD PRESSURE ANY GOOD.
MYBLOOD ?
MR. JAMES, IT'S JOEL BRENNER
OVER AT THEURBANITE.
WANTS TO KNOW IF YOU'LL WRITE

I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

YES.  NOW.
MY GOD, SEARS.
SOMETHING'S HAPPENING.
I-- I CAN TELL.
SOMETHING TERRIBLE.
YOU CAN BE VERY PERSISTENT.
PERSISTENT
WITHOUT BEING A BULLY.
THAT'S A VERY NICE QUALITY,
RICKY.
- DON'T TRY TO BAMBOOZLE ME.
- IT'S A FEW BAD DREAMS !
AND A MONTHLY SPOOK STORY.
COME ON, NOW.
LET'S GET TO WORK.
YOU'RE DISSEMBLING.
IT'S BENEATH YOU.
ALL RIGHT.
WHAT WOULD YOU ADVISE ?
I DON'T KNOW.  BUT WE'VE
GOTTA DO SOMETHING.
HELLO.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE ?
ANSWER ME.
I WON'T HURT YOU.
ANSWER THE MAN, FENNY.
HELLO, MR. HAWTHORNE.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE ?
WHAT DO YOU WANT ?
WE WANT TO PLAY.
ISN'T THAT SO,
LITTLE BROTHER ?
YOU CAN'T STAY HERE.
YOU'RE BREAKING THE LAW.
- IS THAT SO ?
- YOU'RE TRESPASSING HERE,
ILLEGALLY !
NO.  NO, WE'RE NOT.
- WE KNOW THE OWNER.
- THERE IS NO OWNER.
SURE, THERE IS !
WE'VE SPOKEN TO HER.
- WHO ?
- OUR FRIEND.
OUR NEW FRIEND.
NO ONE LIVES HERE.
SOMEONE LIVED HERE.
SOMEONE FANTASTIC.
WHAT ?
YOU'VE LIVED IN THIS TOWN
ALL YOUR LIFE,
AND YOU DON'T KNOW ?
WHAT ?
HE KNOWS,
DOESN'T HE, FENNY ?
MAYBE HE'D LIKE TO PLAY
WITH US, FENNY.
WHAT ?
MAYBE IT'S TIME
HE JOINED OUR LITTLE GAME.
YEAH.  YOU'RE GONNA BE
SEEING SOME UNUSUAL...
AND INTERESTING THINGS
BEFORE WE'RE THROUGH,
RICKY !
NO.
AND YOU MIGHT SAY...
YOU'RE GONNA BE HAVING
THE TIME OF YOUR LIFE.
YOU KNOW, RICKY,
YOU'RE NOT GONNA KNOW
IF YOU'RE REAPING OR SOWING.
YOU WON'T KNOW UP
FROM DOWN.  AND, RICKY,
WE'RE GOING TO TEAR THE SOUL
OF THIS PATHETIC TOWN...
AND CRUSH ITS BARE BONES
BETWEEN OUR TEETH !
FENNY DID GOOD,
DIDN'T HE, LADY ?
EXCELLENT.
YOU LIKED THAT, DIDN'T YOU ?
I LOVED IT.  NOW I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO NEXT.
THAT'S HIM !
GREGORY BATE.
ARE YOU SURE,
MR. HAWTHORNE ?
POSITIVE.
THE EVIDENCE,
TAKEN AS A WHOLE,
LEADS ME TO ONLY ONE
POSSIBLE CONCLUSION.
THAT EDWARD CHARLES WANDERLEY,
HIS MIND IN A STATE
OF CONFUSION,
TOOK HIS OWN LIFE.
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS !
GET THEM OUT OF THAT HOUSE
TODAY.  DO YOU HEAR ME ?
I'M SURE EVERYBODY
HAS BY NOW.
DON'T SMART-ASS ME.
JUST GET 'EM OUTTA THERE.
SEARS JAMES,
I DON'T SUPPOSE
THERE'S ANY MAN ALIVE...
WHO EVER GOT IN
THE LAST WORD WITH YOU.
I SHOULD HOPE
TO HELL NOT !
MR. HAWTHORNE.
MEET ME AT THE VILLAGE
PUMP IN HALF AN HOUR.
IT'S JUST LIKE MR. HAWTHORNE
SAID, WALT.  BATE IS CRAZY.
"EXTREMELY UNSTABLE,"
IT SAYS HERE.
HE AND THE BOY ESCAPED
FROM A STATE MENTAL HOSPITAL
ABOUT A MONTH AGO.
AND, WALT...
HE WAS A MEMBER OF SOME KIND
OF OCCULT ORDER...
BACK IN CALIFORNIA.
GEEZ, WHAT A PAIR !
MM, WALT !
WHAT ABOUT THIS OCCULT
BUSINESS ?
YOU THINK THERE'S
ANYTHING TO IT ?
I AIN'T NO FREUD.
DAMN FUNNY WORLD.
GETTIN' TO BE
A DAMN FUNNY WORLD.
STRANGEST THINGS
POP INTO MY HEAD.
I WAS JUST THINKING
THAT SIDEWALKS
HAVE CHANGED THE WORLD.
-ONE OF MY EARLIEST
RECOLLECTIONS IS--
- MR. HAWTHORNE ?
CALL ME RICKY.  EVERYBODY DOES.
GETTING BACK TO SIDEWALKS,
YOUR FATHER AND I
USED TO--
MR. HAWTHORNE.
YOU DIDN'T ASK ME HERE
TO TALK ABOUT SIDEWALKS,
DID YOU ?
NO.  NO.
SEARS WOULD BRAIN ME
FOR SAYING THIS,
BUT I THINK
WE'RE IN DANGER.
ALL OF US: MILBURN,
THE CHOWDER SOCIETY.
ESPECIALLY
THE CHOWDER SOCIETY.
WHO IS THIS ?
I'M NEVER GONNA FIND NOTHIN'.
ONLY A PAIR OF LOONIES.
COCKAMAMIE !
SOMEONE'S IDEA OF A JOKE.
THE LORD IS MY SHEPHERD,
I SHALL NOT WANT.
HE MAKETH ME TO LIE DOWN
IN GREEN PASTURES.
HE RESTORETH--
HOW DID YOU
GET IN HERE ?
SUCH A TRAGEDY.
I'M SO VERY SORRY.
WHAT KIND OF WELCOME
IS THAT, DON ?
SOMEONE'S DIED HERE.
WHAT DO YOU WANT ?
HOW DO YOU KNOW MY NAME ?
TO LOOK.
TO TOUCH.
????
WHO ARE YOU ?
MY NAME IS GREGORY BATE,
ALTHOUGH I'VE BEEN KNOWN
BY OTHER NAMES IN OTHER PLACES.
GET OUT !
ARE YOU AFRAID, DON ?
WILL YOU BE AFRAID WHEN
YOU WALK THROUGH THE VALLEY
OF THE SHADOW OF DEATH ?
YOU'RE CRAZY.
GREAT TREATS ARE IN STORE
FOR YOU AND YOUR OLD FRIENDS.
IMAGINE.
JUST IMAGINE.
- GET THE HELL OUT !
- WE'RE FULL OF SURPRISES,
AREN'T WE, FENNY ?
-
-
-   GOOD BOY.
WE DO HAVE SOMETHING SPECIAL
FOR DON, DON'T WE ?
IT'S A LITTLE PRESENT
FROM OUR BENEFACTOR.
WHERE DID YOU GET THAT ?
EVERY WINTER.
ICE.  THE POWER LINES.
YOU SHOULD
SEE YOURSELVES.
YOU LOOK LIKE
THREE OWLS.
LEAVE THE CANDLES, MILLY.
YOU'RE GIVING
EACH OTHER THE WILLIES
WITH THESE MEETINGS.
- HE'S FOUND A PICTURE OF HER.
-
WHO ?
- DON.
- BUT THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE.
I THOUGHT WE--
I'M AFRAID EDWARD KEPT ONE.
- WHAT HAVE YOU TOLD HIM ?
- NOTHING.
I WANTED TO.
I LIKE THE BOY.
- THE CIRCLE
HAS HELD THIS LONG.
- MAYBE HE CAN HELP US.
- CHANGE IS CHANGE
FOR THE WORSE !
- SPOKEN LIKE A TRUE LAWYER.
HUH !
WE CAN FEEL THINGS
WATCHING US
AND FOLLOWING US,
AND WE DISMISS THEM
AS FANTASIES.
WE HAVE NIGHTMARES
AND TRY TO FORGET THEM.
NOW THAT EDWARD'S GONE,
I FEAR--
I VERY MUCH FEAR...
THAT MORE OF US
ARE GOING TO DIE.
I THINK HE'S RIGHT.
- I TOLD HIM
YOU WEREN'T TO BE DISTURBED.
- THAT'LL BE ALL, MILLY.
- MILLY.
- WELL, THEN, I'LL JUST
LEAVE YOU GENTLEMEN...
TO YOUR PRIVATE BUSINESS.
WELL, YOUNG MAN,
DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING
TO SAY TO US ?
I WANT TO BUY MY WAY
INTO THE CHOWDER SOCIETY.
BUY ?
WHAT DID YOU SAY ?
WITH A STORY.
ISN'T THAT THE PRICE
OF ADMISSION ?
I'M SORRY, MR. HAWTHORNE.
RICKY.
BUT IT'S WORSE THAN YOU KNOW.
AT LEAST TWO PEOPLE
HAVE ALREADY DIED.
MY BROTHER WAS THE FIRST.
I THINK THIS IS
A GHOST STORY.
I HAD LANDED A...
YEAR'S TEACHING JOB...
AT A SMALL LIBERAL ARTS
COLLEGE JUST NORTH
OF ORLANDO, FLORIDA.
PRETTY UNROMANTIC STUFF,
REALLY.  JUST A COUPLE
OF SECTIONS...
OF AN UNDERGRADUATE COURSE
IN AMERICAN LITERATURE.
WAIT UP !
I WAS SEEING-- I WAS SORT OF
SEEING THIS OTHER INSTRUCTOR,
A GIRL NAMED HELEN KAYON.
MR. WANDERLEY.
- WHO WAS THAT ?
-THE DEAN'S NEW SECRETARY.
JUST STARTED TODAY.
- HOW'D SHE KNOW WHO I WAS ?
- IT MUST BE THOSE BLUE EYES
OF YOURS.
RIGHT.
- CALL ME TONIGHT.
- ALL RIGHT.
"AND THE FIRST THING
SHE DOES IS SEDUCE HIM.
"THE FIRST THING HE DOES
IS TO BE SEDUCED.
"AND THE SECOND THING
THEY DO...
"IS HUG THEIR SIN
IN SECRET...
"AND GLOAT OVER IT.
AND TRY TO UNDERSTAND."
WHICH IS THE MYTH
OF NEW ENGLAND.
BETWEEN NOW
AND THE NEXT TIME WE MEET,
I'D LIKE YOU TO THINK ABOUT
WHAT D.H. LAWRENCE MEANT
WHEN HE WROTE THAT.
DO YOU HAVE A QUESTION,
MR. SOLT ?
YEAH, THE PART
ABOUT SEDUCTION.
- YES ?
- COULD YOU BE
A LITTLE MORE SPECIFIC ?
NEXT TIME.
SO YOU'RE WORKIN' LATE,
HUH ?
MR. WANDERLEY.
NO, THAT'S NOT REALLY FAIR,
IS IT ?  YOU KNOW MY NAME,
AND I DON'T KNOW YOURS.
ALMA.  ALMA MOBLEY.
- SHALL I TELL THE DEAN--
- OH, NO !  NOT--
NOT RIGHT AWAY.
UM, HE'S--  I REALLY
STOPPED BY TO SEE YOU.
I WONDERED IF YOU'RE NOT BUSY,
UH, TONIGHT,
UH, IF YOU'RE NOT DOING
ANYTHING SPECIAL, MAYBE YOU'D
LIKE TO JOIN ME FOR DINNER.
UH, I MEAN--
AH, WANDERLEY.
YOU MUST HAVE BEEN
READING MY MIND.
YOU'VE BEEN DOING
EXEMPLARY WORK, DONALD.
THANK YOU.
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOUR PLANS ARE,
BUT I WAS JUST THINKING...
MAYBE WE SHOULD
EXTEND YOUR STAY HERE
ANOTHER YEAR.
CLOSE YOUR EYES.
MAKE A WISH.
IF YOU WANT TO MAKE LOVE
TO ME, YOU'D BETTER HURRY !
????
DO YOU LIKE IT ?
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
I'M FRIGHTENED
OF THUNDER.
I GUESS I'D BETTER
STAY HERE TONIGHT.
YES.
????
AHHH !
I WANT YOU !
I WANT ANOTHER KISS.
WE'RE GOING TO BE LATE.
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT YOU, YOU KNOW ?
THERE'S NOTHING MUCH
TO KNOW.  I'M JUST
AN OLD-FASHIONED GIRL.
I'LL SAY.
- COME ON, TELL ME.
- NOT NOW.
WELL, UH,
WHERE ARE YOU FROM ?
YOU'RE ENGLISH, RIGHT ?
SO H-HOW'D YOU WIND UP
DOWN HERE ?
NONE OF THAT MATTERS.
I WANT TO KNOW ABOUT YOU.
TELL ME WHERE YOU LIVE.
AH, JUST A COUPLE OF ROOMS.
NO, NO.
WHERE YOU GREW UP.
AH, MILBURN ?
WELL, IT'S JUST A GRAVE
OF A TOWN IN NEW ENGLAND.
UH, NOTHIN'S CHANGED THERE
IN ABOUT 200 YEARS.
SOUNDS LOVELY.
IT'S NOT.  IT'S BORING.
WILL YOU TAKE ME THERE
SOMETIME ?
YEAH.
PROMISE ?
YEAH,
I PROMISE.
????
NOW.
????
I WANT YOU... NOW.
HERE ?
HERE.
OR NEVER AGAIN.
????
THIS DOOR IS NOT TO BE LOCKED
AT ANY TIME.
THERE'S MRS. MEREDITH.
OPEN THIS DOOR THIS INSTANT.
DO YOU HEAR ME ?
DON'T STOP.
DON'T STOP.  DON'T STOP.
DON'T STOP.
????
YOU'RE NOT WEARING--
UM--
WHERE'D YOU LEAVE 'EM ?
DID YOU LEAVE--
YOU FOLKS LIKE TO ORDER NOW ?
-
- COME ON, TELL ME.  I'VE TOLD
YOU EVERYTHING ABOUT ME.
NO SECRETS.
ALL RIGHT.
NO.
THERE'S NO ONE ELSE
IN YOUR LIFE ?
JUST YOU.
WELL.  BUT
THERE WAS SOMEONE.
- LONG TIME AGO.
- YOU WERE IN LOVE
WITH HIM ?
IT WASN'T ANYTHING
LIKE YOU'RE THINKING.
JUST--
JUST TELL ME THAT--
TELL ME THAT
IT DOESN'T, UH--
- HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH YOU ?
- IT WASN'T A GREAT LOVE.
- NO.
- GOOD.
BECAUSE I'M GOING TO BE,
AND I DON'T WANT THERE
TO BE ANYONE ELSE.
JUST ME.
NOW LET ME TELL YOU
WHERE I'M GONNA TAKE YOU
NEXT WEEKEND.
YOU HAVEN'T DONE ANY WORK
IN WEEKS.
- I DON'T CARE.
- I'M A BAD INFLUENCE.
YES, YOU ARE BAD.
WHAT IS IT, ALMA ?
WATER.
LET'S, UH...
ELOPE.
WE COULD, UH...
GO TO THE GREEK ISLANDS.
CRETE.
DON, I'D LOVE THAT.
- BUT--
- BUT WHAT ?
I'D RATHER GO TO MILBURN.
NO.  NOT MILBURN.
YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT ?
DON'T YOU WANT
TO SHOW ME OFF
TO YOUR HOMETOWN ?
I WANT TO MEET
YOUR FAMILY.
WELL, MY MOTHER DIED
A LONG TIME AGO.
BUT YOUR FATHER,
HE'S STILL ALIVE.
AH, MY FATHER AND I DON'T
GET ALONG ALL THAT WELL.
SURELY THIS IS DIFFERENT.
THIS IS OUR WEDDING.
WHAT'S YOUR BROTHER LIKE ?
HE'S MORE LIKE MY FATHER,
I GUESS.
SUCCESSFUL.  AMBITIOUS.
MORE OF A HUNTER.
YOU DON'T REALLY
WANT TO GET MARRIED
IN MILBURN, DO YOU ?
I WANT TO GET MARRIED
IN THE TOWN WHERE YOU
GREW UP.
THE SAME CHURCH.
I WANT TO WALK
DOWN THE AISLE...
IN MY WHITE DRESS
AND VEIL,
AND I WANT EVERYONE
TO BE THERE.
YOUR FATHER,
HIS FRIENDS,
THE WHOLE TOWN.
ALL OF MILBURN.
I WILL TAKE YOU PLACES...
WHERE YOU HAVE NEVER BEEN.
I WILL SHOW YOU THINGS
THAT YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN.
ALMA ?
AND I WILL SEE THE LIFE
RUN OUT OF YOU.
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT ?
ALMA ?
DO YOU REMEMBER ?
THE FIRST NIGHT
YOU WERE HERE.
IT WAS RAINING THEN.
WHAT IS IT ?
LET'S TALK TOMORROW.
NOW.
I DON'T WANT TO GET
MARRIED FOR A WHILE.
WHEN ?
I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE NOT AT ALL.
YOU HAVE TO.
I'M SORRY.
YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING !
NO.
????
ALMA.
ALMA !
ALMA, LISTEN--
CAN I HELP YOU,
MR. WANDERLEY ?
WHERE IS SHE ?
MISS MOBLEY DID NOT TURN UP
FOR WORK THIS MORNING,
NOR DID SHE PHONE...
TO SAY THAT
SHE WOULD BE ABSENT.
THE DEAN IS MOST UPSET.
YOU'RE LAX.  YOU'RE LAZY.
YOU'RE SLIPSHOD.
YOU DISAPPEAR FOR DAYS
ON END WITHOUT SAYING
A WORD TO ANYONE.
DISAPPOINTED ?
I THOUGHT YOU
MADE A GOOD START.
ALMA ?
WAIT.  THAT'S
THE KIDS THERE ?
RIGHT.
WHO IS IT ?
YOUR BROTHER ON 32.
OKAY.
HI, DONNIE.
AH, DAVID.
I BEEN THINKIN' ABOUT YOU.
I'M GLAD YOU CALLED.
UH, DAVE,
I GOTTA TALK TO YOU.
YEAH.  I GOTTA TALK TO YOU.
I GOT SOME AMAZING NEWS.
WHAT ?  ROBERT REDFORD
BOUGHT YOUR LIFE STORY ?
NO, I'M SERIOUS.
UM, I JUST DON'T KNOW
HOW TO TELL YOU.
ALL RIGHT.  WELL,
TRY STARTING AT THE TOP.
OKAY.  UM,
ABOUT A MONTH AGO,
I WAS UP ON COLUMBUS AVENUE
ON BUSINESS,
AND, UH, SOMEBODY
CALLED OUT YOUR NAME.
UH-HUH.
I TURNED AROUND,
AND THERE'S THIS
GREAT-LOOKING GIRL.
SHE THINKS I'M YOU, RIGHT ?
WELL, I HOPE YOU
GOT AROUND TO TELLIN' HER.
YES.  I GOT AROUND
TO TELLIN' HER.
WHAT'S HER NAME, DAVE ?
DONNIE.
UH, SHE IS NOT THE PERSON
THAT YOU THINK SHE IS.
SHIT.
SHE'S WORRIED YOU HAVE
THE WRONG IDEA ABOUT HER.
EVERYTHING ABOUT HER
IS WRONG.
GET AWAY FROM HER, DAVE.
SHE'S DANGEROUS.
I CAN UNDERSTAND
YOU BEING UPSET.
IF ALMA HAD WALKED OUT
ON ME TO MARRY YOU,
I'D SURE AS HELL RESENT YOU.
I DON'T RESENT ANYTHING.
OH, COME OFF IT.
IF YOU CAN'T ADMIT--
SHUT THE HELL UP
AND LISTEN TO ME, DAVE.
LOOK AT HER.
ALL RIGHT ?
SHE IS NOT REAL.
AND YOU KNOW, LIKE,
WHEN YOU TOUCH HER ?
SHE'S COLD.
I DON'T THINK WE'RE TALKIN'
ABOUT THE SAME WOMAN.
WHEN THEY BROKE DOWN THE DOOR
TO DAVID'S APARTMENT,
NO ONE WAS THERE.
SHE HAD SIMPLY VANISHED.
THERE HAD NEVER BEEN
AN ALMA MOBLEY.
I CAN VOUCH FOR THEIR MERIT.
HAVANA.
WHAT ABOUT MY STORY ?
WELL, THAT WAS QUITE A TALE,
YOUNG MAN.
IT HAPPENED.
JUST THE WAY I TOLD YOU.
WHY IS SHE HERE ?
-
SHE MUST HAVE HEARD YOU.
-
I KNOW YOU'RE SCARED.
I'M SCARED TOO.
I'M LUCKY TO HAVE ESCAPED
WHATEVER SENT DAVID
OUT THAT WINDOW.
BUT I THINK...
IF WE HELP EACH OTHER--
SOUNDS LIKE KNUTE ROCKNE
BEFORE A BIG GAME,
DOESN'T HE, RICKY ?
THAT'S ALMA MOBLEY.
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.
I KNEW THIS
WAS GOING TO HAPPEN.
- COINCIDENCE.
- I DON'T THINK SO.
NEITHER DO I.
NO.
I'M AN OLD MAN
AND OFTEN I'M RUDE.
WE'LL ALL BE VERY GRATEFUL
FOR ANY HELP YOU CAN GIVE US.
I KNEW IT.
I JUST KNEW IT !
THE LAST TIME I SAW ALMA,
SHE WAS WEARING THIS.
WHERE'D YOU GET IT ?
A LITTLE PRESENT
FROM GREGORY BATE.
- THISHADTO HAPPEN.
IT JUST HAD TO !
- THAT'S ENOUGH !
OH, NO.  NO.
WE-- WE MUST TALK ABOUT IT.

LET'S NOT STOP !
OH, MY FRIENDS !

NO, I'M NOT GOING IN !
NO !  NOO-OO !
IT'S JUST AS I TOLD YOU.
NO PULSE AT ALL.
NO PULSE AT ALL.
SHE'S DEAD.
LIKE I SAID.
-

NO !
- JOHN !
- CAN'T MOVE.
YOU'RE DEAD !
IT'S ME.
- I DON'T BELIEVE IT !
NO PULSE.
- MILLY.  MILLY.
NO.  NO !  NO.
I'LL BE DOWN
IN JUST A MINUTE, MISS.
MILLY ?
RISE AND SHINE NOW.
THERE.
IS IT LATE ?
OH.
YOU NEEDED THE REST.
COME ON, NOW.
I BROUGHT YOU
A NICE CUP OF TEA,
THOUGH YOU HARDLY DESERVE IT
AFTER LAST NIGHT.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN ?
YOU KNOW VERY WELL.
- YOU ATTACKED ME !
- I WHAT ?
YOU STARED AT ME AS IF
YOU'D NEVER SEEN ME BEFORE.
OH, MILLY.
FORGIVE ME.
TOO MANY OF THOSE
DARN STORIES.
TOO MUCH OF THAT HIGH AND MIGHTY
MR. SEARS JAMES.
OH, DEAR GOD,
I'M TIRED.
TELL ME.
YOU CAN TRUST ME.
BAD DREAMS AGAIN.
YES.
IT'S ALL OVER.
DAYLIGHT NOW.
JOHN ?
I CAN'T REMEMBER.
"SHE MOVED."
YES, SHE MOVED.
WHO MOVED ?
SHE COULDN'T--
COULDN'T HAVE.
SHE--
THERE'S NO PULSE.
SHE'S DEAD.
FOR GOD'S SAKE, JOHN.
WHO ?
SHE WAS--
NO.  IT'S J-J-JUST
THE JIMJAMS.
NO.  TELL ME.
NOW, GO ON, GO ON.
STOP FUSSING.
YOU'RE A STUBBORN OLD MULE,
JOHN JAFFREY.

ARE YOU SURE ?
I TELL YOU,
THERE'S NO PULSE.
I'VE MURDERED HER ?
NO.  NO.
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.
WE'VE GOTTA
CALL THE POLICE.
I'LL GO TO JAIL.
RUINED.
SCANDAL.
I'M A MURDERER.
I'M A GODDAMN MURDERER !
LOOK, WE'RE ALL
IN THIS TOGETHER.
LET'S CALL THE POLICE.
NO.  NO !

TO HIDE THE BODY.

I TELL YOU, SHE'S DEAD.
NO !  EVA !  EVA !
NO !  EVA !  EVA !
NO !
EVA.  EVA.
EVA.
WE'D NEVER TALK ABOUT IT AGAIN.
NOT EVEN WITH EACH OTHER.
WE TOLD OURSELVES
IT WAS A TRICK OF THE LIGHT.
WE PUT IT BEHIND US.
BACK TO WORK, SCHOOL.
GOT ON WITH THE REST
OF OUR LIVES.
WASN'T SHE MISSED ?
THE TOWN ASSUMED SHE'D GOT
TIRED OF IT AND MOVED ON.
THERE WAS A BIT OF TALK,
BUT IT DIED DOWN.
YOU COULD ALMOST FEEL
THE SIGH OF RELIEF
THAT SHE HAD GONE.
YOU MEAN NOBODY EVER
SHOWED UP ASKIN' ABOUT HER ?
IT WAS AS IF SHE
HAD NEVER BEEN HERE.
AS IF IT HAD
NEVER HAPPENED.
AS IF WE HAD DREAMED
THE WHOLE AFFAIR.
AH, WHAT ABOUT THE CAR ?
STILL AT THE BOTTOM
OF THE DEDHAM POND.
AND YOU STAYED HERE ?
YOU NEVER LEFT.
WE COULDN'T.
NOT FOR LONG, ANYWAY.
WHAT ELSE COULD WE HAVE DONE ?
RUINED FOUR MORE LIVES ?
COULD HAVE GONE TO THE POLICE
AND TAKEN OUR CHANCES.
INSTEAD, WE DID THIS...
OBSCENE THING.
YOU THINK IT'S EVA ?
- AND THAT SOMEHOW OR OTHER
SHE'S COME BACK TO US, HUH ?
- YEAH.
SO DO I.
I THINK MAYBE BY GROWIN' OLD,
MAYBE THE FORCES, OR WHATEVER
THE HELL YOU WANT TO CALL THEM,
HAVE INCREASED.
AND THESE STORIES
AND THESE NIGHTMARES--
- MAYBE THE GUILT--
- IS THAT WHAT KILLED EDWARD ?
AND MY BROTHER.
AND DR. JAFFREY.
I THINK GREGORY BATE
AND THE BOY...
ARE HELPIN' HER.
I WANT TO GO TO HER HOUSE.
I HOPE YOU'LL COME WITH ME.
I WILL.
AND WHERE DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE GOING ?
OUT.
AH.  YOU'LL DO
NO SUCH THING.
YOU'LL MARCH RIGHT BACK
UPSTAIRS BEFORE YOU
CATCH PNEUMONIA.
- BUT I HAVE TO GO OUT.
- WHERE ?
YOU INFURIATE ME
WITH YOUR SECRETS.
I'VE BEEN MARRIED TO YOU
FOR 32 YEARS,
AND I'M NO CLOSER TO YOU
THAN THE DAY WE WERE MARRIED.
I'LL TELL YOU IN THE SPRING.
I'M GOING TO TAKE YOU
TO THE SOUTH OF FRANCE,
TO ANTIBES, SAINT-TROPEZ,
ANYWHERE YOU WANT TO GO.
AND I'M GONNA TELL YOU
THE STORY OF MY LIFE.
I NEVER THOUGHT
I'D SET FOOT
IN THIS HOUSE AGAIN.
IF ONLY WE'D BEEN 30
INSTEAD OF 20.
OH, WHAT FOOLS
WE WERE.
I DON'T THINK
ANYBODY'S HERE.
SHE'S HERE.
I'M SURE OF IT.
YOU WANT TO TRY
UPSTAIRS ?
NOTHING WILL COME OF THIS.
DO YOU WANT TO STAY
DOWNSTAIRS, MR. JAMES ?
NOT ON YOUR LIFE.
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE, BUT
ALL THIS WAS SO BEAUTIFUL THEN.
THE ROOMS DOWNSTAIRS AND HER
ROOM UP HERE, JUST BEAUTIFUL.
SO WAS ALMA'S.
OHH !
AAAH.
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S ENOUGH.
WE'LL ALL GO.
HE CAN'T BE MOVED.
PLEASE, SEARS.
IF WE STAY TOGETHER--
RICKY, DON'T ARGUE WITH ME !
I'M TOO OLD, TOO TIRED
AND TOO FRIGHTENED.
SEARS !
I'LL BE BACK WITH HELP
AS SOON AS I CAN.
I COULD NEVER MAKE HIM
DO ANYTHING HE DIDN'T
WANT TO DO.
- YOU OKAY ?
- YEAH.
ALL CLEAR SO FAR.
CAN YOU HEAR ME ?
YEAH.
RICKY ?
RICKY ?
FIND ANYTHING ?
JUST AN EMPTY ROOM.
YOU OKAY ?
YEAH.
I WAS JUST THINKING.
WHAT, ABOUT
THE SIDEWALKS AGAIN ?
NO, YOU SCAMP.
IT'S SEARS.
I'M WORRIED ABOUT HIM.
A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK I TAKE
TOO MUCH GUFF FROM HIM,
BUT I DON'T MIND THAT.
IT'S SORT OF PERMANENT
JUNIOR PARTNERSHIP STUFF,
YOU KNOW ?
WHAT CAN I DO ?  I'VE BEEN
MARRIED TO THE GUY AS SURE
AS I'VE BEEN MARRIED TO STELLA.
HE'LL BE OKAY.
I WONDER.
DANCE WITH ME,
YOU LITTLE TOAD.
-
-
MAYBE HE JUST GOT STUCK
IN THE SNOW.
HE'D HAVE COME BACK
IF HE WAS ALL RIGHT.
I DON'T LIKE IT.
WE'LL END IT, RICKY.
WE'LL LAY HER TO REST.
- AN OLD MAN AND A PUP, HUH ?
- WE ARE THE CHOWDER SOCIETY
NOW.
SEARS WAS RIGHT.
YOU SOUND LIKE KNUTE ROCKNE.
HERE.
I HAVE TO GET YOU
TO A DOCTOR.
BE RIGHT BACK.
- THANK GOODNESS
YOU CAME ALONG.
- LUCKY FOR BOTH OF US, RICKY.
DON'T STRUGGLE,
OR I'LL KILL YOU RIGHT NOW !
YOU HEAR ME ?
- YOU'LL BE QUIET ?
- YEAH.
- THAT'S A GOOD LITTLE RABBIT.
- WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS ?
WOULD YOU LIKE TO
LIVE FOREVER, RICKY ?
THAT'S WHAT SHE PROMISED US.
IMAGINE THE PEACE
OF LYING DOWN WITH YOUR HANDS
ACROSS YOUR CHEST.
YOU GO TO HELL.
IMAGINE HER WAITING FOR YOU
ALL THESE YEARS.
IMAGINE HER SLEEPING
UNDER ICE AND SNOW.
- WAITING.
- THE POND.
WOULDN'T YOU LIKE
TO BE IMMORTAL,
EVEN IF YOU MUST DIE FIRST ?
GOOD LORD,
SHE'S IN THE POND.
ALIVE.
STILL ALIVE.
SH-SHE TRICKED YOU !
YOU WON'T LIVE FOREVER.
OH, I'LL LIVE LONGER
THAN YOU.
OH, NO, YOU WON'T !
OH.
YOU'RE OUTTA YOUR SKULL.
YOU KNOW THAT, MR. HAWTHORNE ?
WE'VE GOT TO HURRY.
WE'VE GOT TO HELP
THE BOY.
AREN'T YOU EVEN
GOING TO SAY HELLO ?
OH, DON,
YOU DISAPPOINT ME.
I THOUGHT YOU'D
BE DYING TO SEE ME.
Y-YOU'RE NOT HERE.
YOU'RE NOT HERE.
TALK SENSE, DON.
YOU CAN SEE ME, CAN'T YOU ?
YOU CAN HEAR ME.
- I'M HERE.
- GET AWAY FROM ME !
FASTER !
POOR DON.
HAVEN'T YOU BEEN
LONGING FOR ME ?
WAITING FOR ME ?
- I'VE COME FOR YOU.
- YOU'RE DEAD !
AND YOU WILL BE TOO.
DEAD AND WET AND COLD.
DON'T YOU WANT
TO MAKE LOVE TO ME ?
DON'T YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHAT YOU'VE TOUCHED ?
I WILL TAKE YOU PLACES
WHERE YOU'VE NEVER BEEN.
I WILL SHOW YOU THINGS
THAT YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN.
NO.
AND I WILL SEE THE LIFE
RUN OUT OF YOU.
