Damn!
Blast the hatch! Now!
That experiment must not
get off this ship!
Oh, hi.
Bye.
Oh, I gotta pass this test.
I gotta get an A.
We interrupt this program
for a KING news flash.
Authorities at the Crestridge Institute
for the criminally insane...
...have requested
an all-points bullet...
He's so dreamy.
Oh, he's just the most.
Who?
Ray?
They broke up.
Oh, come on, Muffy.
The guy's a cop. He has no future.
I mean,
wake up and smell the coffee, Muffy.
What?
Well, Pam told me, who else?
Sure, she's right here next to me.
We are roommates, you know.
What? Where?
No, that was Friday night.
You're such a gomer sometimes.
Did you see
Plan 9 from Outer Space?
Star light, star bright, first star I...
Say,
which one is the brightest star?
Hey, haven't you kids
heard the radio?
There's some nutbar on the loose,
so I sugg...
Pam?
Hello, Ray.
Just go home, will you?
Just go home.
You know that cop?
He's just someone from my past.
What about the brightest star,
anyway?
Neato!
I vote for that one.
Are you sure this is a good idea?
Come on, cool out, will you?
I'm telling you,
it went down right over there.
Oh, no, Johnny.
This place gives me the creeps.
Johnny?
You stay here.
You're kidding, right?
Another update
from the KING newsroom.
Police continue the search
for a 35-year-old escapee...
...from the Crestridge Mental Institute,
who, officials confirm...
...killed four orderlies
in a brutal spree early tonight.
Crestridge police warn the man
is armed with a large fire ax...
...and is believed to be moving west
on Route 66...
...toward
the Corman University area.
Johnny?
Johnny.
Can we go back to the point now?
I'll even let you fondle my breasts.
Johnny.
I'm getting lonely out here
by myself.
Johnny.
I'm depressed.
Oh, will you cheer up?
Come on, this is college life.
You know, toilet paper in the trees,
spring is in the air...
...a couple of bitchen guys
on the prowl for major league babes.
Face it, J.C., we're dorks.
We're lameoids.
My grandparents have sex
more than we do.
Well, granted, but you talk
like that's a negative thing.
Good point. I feel a lot better.
Good, so do I.
J.C., do me a favor.
Anything, dude.
You got it, you know it.
Don't try and cheer me up.
Look, Chris, when you're depressed,
I'm depressed.
And I don't like being depressed.
It's, well, you know...
- Depressing?
- Depressing, yeah.
So do me a favor, okay, bud?
Cut out this being depressed shit.
Chris, this is me talking here.
I'm your bud. I love you.
We have a bond, a warmth,
a communication.
Who's that?
- Who's what?
- Her. The vision.
- The angel, the goddess.
- The one with the hogans?
Yeah, who is she?
I think that's the Morton Salt girl.
How the hell should I know?
Hey, you, honey. Toots, yo.
Yeah, what's your name?
J.C., remind me
to kill you sometime.
Kill me sometime, huh?
Great.
Now what do I do?
Well, you could always just stand here
like an idiot and not do anything.
Kidding, joke, levity, humor.
Shit.
She's going in the Beta house.
Oh, that bitch.
I hate the Betas.
Look, do you wanna meet her
or what?
I wanna marry her.
I hate to break this to you, bud.
It's gonna be quite a blow,
but you have to meet her first.
I know it's a hassle, but hey,
I don't make up the rules, pal.
Bingo.
- Where?
- One o'clock.
Great. She's with a guy.
Yeah, but look at him.
I mean, the guy's a bozo.
He's the missing link.
Chris, the man
has one continuous eyebrow.
Yeah, well, he's also got her.
It's all positive thinking.
Now, watch this.
J.C.'s going in for the main event.
Final countdown, third and 10.
This is gonna be beautiful.
You'll love this.
So are you gonna come to the game
with me sometime?
- Maybe.
- Sure, it'd be great.
Sit on the bench
and watch them play, it'd be great.
Love to have you there.
Sounds like fun.
Yeah.
Tiger.
Excuse me, what's his name?
Steve.
Steve, bud, how's it going?
I think there
was a telephone call for you inside.
Thanks, dude.
Later, Cindy.
- Bye.
- No problem.
Cindy. Cindy what?
There isn't really a phone call for him,
is there?
Cynthia, my time is limited.
Much like the intellect of Steve.
You see
that attractive gentleman over there...
...by the ale dispenser?
Well, I'm his agent, and it is vital
that I obtain this information.
You see, the fate of the entire
free world hangs in the balance.
Cynthia Cronenberg.
- And why didn't he ask me himself?
- Tell him that.
- I would.
- But you have a boyfriend?
Hey, you're cruising, man.
There was no call for me.
Silly me, I don't understand
how that could've happened.
What was your name again? Chad?
Biff? Riff?
Steve.
And I don't think you're very funny.
Don't tell me.
About as funny as a crutch?
Get it?
Give me.
Talk, squeal, spill the beans.
Chill out. All right.
Okay, she knows her name
for starters.
Which for a sorority girl
is pretty impressive.
Cut to the chase.
Does she have a boyfriend?
She didn't say, but I don't think so.
This is it.
I think...
I think
I can possibly be in love here.
You realize there's one way this girl
is ever gonna take you seriously.
Right.
If I belong to a frat.
Preferably this one.
I was thinking more
along the lines of talking to her.
J.C.
Bud, you're so naive.
Yeah.
Now, let me get this straight.
You guys wanna pledge the Betas?
That's right.
Well, now...
...what makes you guys think
you're Beta material?
I mean, we've pretty much found...
...most of the guys we need
to fill the roster this semester.
You'd have
to have something special to offer.
How about money? Moolah, dough.
The old green stuff, fun ticket.
Cabbage, the old dollar sign.
Come on, killer-roo.
I'm talking about the dinars,
yens, rupee...
Quiet already.
Gentlemen...
...the brothers and I
can't make any promises at this point.
But I do have a proposal.
If you guys were willing to perform...
...a little act of devotion...
...some task that would prove
the sincerity of your feelings...
...toward this organization.
We don't have to have sex
with a farm animal, do we?
Interesting suggestion, but no.
We had something...
...a little more challenging in mind.
Look, at least we don't have
to have sex with a farm animal.
Hey, you might like it.
You wouldn't want Cynthia anymore.
- That's not funny.
- Really, I'm serious.
Shut up.
Brother Brad,
if these guys pull this off...
...are we really gonna let them in?
Get serious.
Babe, where you been?
Oh, rush stuff.
Goddamn it.
Great, I know that number.
Rudy. Hi, how you doing?
Listen, I can't remember that last digit
to the stupid security card.
Well, you need the digit
to get in the door.
Rudy, just, could you look for it?
I think it's in my notebook.
Yeah.
Yeah, on the desk, yeah. I'll wait.
Appreciate it, Rudy.
Why can't they just have a sign?
Oh, a sign? That's good.
What do you want it to say?
"Corpses for use
in wacky fraternity pranks"?
Morgue or something.
Morgue? You're pretty clever.
A little arrow or something?
Come on.
It's gotta be around here some...
What the hell are you doing?
What the hell did you do?
I don't know. Come on.
You're kidding, right?
All right.
No, not the blue notebook.
The red one.
This gives me the creeps.
Hey, how about looking
for the lights?
How can I look for the lights?
I can't see anything.
Well, use your hands.
Hey, better yet,
use your whale radar.
You are so weird.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Think it's taking
the Lord's name in vain to say:
"Oh, my God" a whole bunch
of times really fast like that?
I believe you're allowed...
...to break the commandments
in certain situations.
How about getting the shit
scared out of you...
...by a creepy, scary dead guy
in a refrigerated coffin?
Are you sure he's dead?
Well, I mean...
...l'm pretty sure we could safely say
he's not well, Chris.
- I wonder who he is.
- Walt Disney.
How the hell should I know?
Let's get out of here.
How long has he been here?
What am I, a tour guide?
The guy's sealed up. Let's go.
Wait a minute.
For what? The cops?
J.C., our stupid mission
is to find a cadaver...
...and dump it on the front
of the P.O.G. House.
This guy's obviously
part of some experiment...
...so let's get out of here.
I don't see any other handy
takeout corpses around here, do you?
Wait a second.
"Cryogenic stasis system."
Will you come on?
You really didn't do that.
Cryogenics?
Chris, do you realize what this is?
You heard of freeze-dried coffee,
right?
Well, this is like a freeze-dried human.
A corpsicle.
- You mean like suspended animation?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's like you take someone while
they're alive and you freeze them.
Then you thaw them out
a hundred years later like a TV dinner.
We are talking
total science-fiction here.
Disengage.
No, wait.
That's it, yes, bingo.
I love you, Rudy. Thank you.
- Is he heavy?
- Yeah.
Is he cold?
Think you'll be able to carry him
all the way back?
Hey!
Oh, my God.
Great.
Now what?
Okay. How about we get
a couple of machine guns, right?
And we blow the windows
out of the joint.
And we yell, "Come on in and get me,
you dirty coppers."
I mean,
everything's a joke to you tonight.
Hey, fuck you, Chris.
Look, every single day...
...I put up with your moaning
about what's-her-name...
...and how you wish
you could fall in love.
But you're too chickenshit
to do anything about it.
And then
this Cynthia girl comes along.
Dream girl, 2001.
I say to myself, "What the hell,
I'm sure as hell never gonna get laid...
...so I might as well
help out my best friend."
And then you say, "J.C., help.
We gotta join the fraternity
so she'll give me the time of day."
And I say,
"What the hell, you gotta do it."
And what do I do?
I bust my ass to help you
and you get chickenshit again.
And I push and I push
and I don't give up.
And why? Why?
You don't even know.
You don't even care.
Because it's important to me
that you're happy, is that so crazy?
And we gotta act like jerks
and get in trouble in order to do that.
It's better than acting like jerks
for no reason, right?
So yeah, everything is a joke.
It's hilarious,
because if you take it seriously...
...you just get depressed
all the time like you are. So fuck you.
- Yeah, well, fuck you too.
- You try it.
- If you'd let me.
- You'd want me to.
- You wish.
- Are we done?
I'm sorry I was an asshole.
If you weren't such an asshole,
even girls might like you.
Hey, throw me that pillow, will you?
Freeze!
Thrill me.
Detective Cameron?
No, Bozo the Clown.
We had a call
from University Med Center.
Some experimental lab
has been broken into.
Detective Cameron?
No.
Bullwinkle Moose. Thrill me.
Hey, Ray.
You're looking
at your actual cryogenics lab.
They've had some kid's body
on ice here since 1959.
What is this,
a homicide or a bad B movie?
What's that?
Was a grad student.
Lab technician.
He was scheduled to work here
this evening.
Looks like he worked
a little too hard, huh?
I suppose Rip Van Winkle
will be the other body. Where is it?
The other body isn't here, sir.
What, did he have a date?
What do you mean it isn't here?
The coroner... Jake, did you take it?
I just got here.
I'm confused.
I was told there were two bodies.
- Raimi.
- Yes, sir?
First, knock off the "yes, sir" shit.
Second, since when does
a desk sergeant show up on a call?
Third,
you told me there were two bodies.
Now, I only see the one.
You do know the difference?
It wasn't on the sergeant exam
or anything...
...but if you use your fingers,
it's real easy.
See? One, two.
- Piece of cake.
- Yes, sir.
Well, there were two bodies, but there
was a dispatch problem, you know.
Where were you guys?
Well, sir,
there was a dispatch problem, sir.
A dispatch problem.
Anyway, look, I came down
and met the night janitor.
And got a statement, of course.
This shit is getting old real fast.
I was awakened out of a real
pleasant dream to come down here.
Straighten it out or am I gonna play
poo patrol with your night stick?
I screwed up.
I sent two rookies down here
on a case like this...
...and at some point,
they both went to the...
- They went to the bathroom.
- That's fine, fine.
Candy-assed, but fine.
There's just one minor problem.
Corpses that have been dead
for 27 years...
...do not get up
and go for a walk by themselves!
Sorry we had to make it
an early night, babe...
...but we've got some serious
pledge humiliation to deal with.
Prez?
Lori told me to ask you if I can store
these in the house till Monday. Okay?
Well, what are they?
Well, they're kind of brains
for our bio class.
We have to dissect them.
Wait, human brains?
How about the basement?
Sure.
I just don't want them up here.
Hi, Gordon. Hi, sweetie.
Did you come to help me study
or what, huh?
Where have you been, huh?
- Let's go, let's go.
- Go back. Come along, men.
Caucasian.
Unusual pallor to the complexion...
...what's left of it.
This that body
you were looking for?
Thrill me.
Jesus Christ.
What's this supposed to be?
It's supposed to be
the housemother's cottage.
What you thinking, Ray?
Knock it off.
Did that look to you like it...?
Like it could've been done
with an ax?
I said stop it.
That psycho disappeared
Do you get off on living in the past?
- Get him up. Yeah, all right.
- Are you ready?
Watch it.
Now, stay back, girls.
You don't wanna see this.
Oh, right.
She was. She was blond.
She had on a blue sweater.
You didn't see her?
- Are you serious?
- Yes.
She was checking.
That was not too cool, bros.
- Hi, Brad.
- Okay, so we put you up to it.
But we said
the Phi Omega Gamma house...
...not the Kappa Delta sorority.
Do you know the difference?
It's all Greek to me.
That was a little joke. I was kidding.
A lot of girls were seriously freaked out
last night because of you.
Wait a second, okay?
Listen, Brother Bratskeller.
A, that whole stunt
was your Nobel Prize-winning idea...
...and B, we didn't even pull it off.
We chickened out, okay?
So why don't you just get off our case
and go practice goose-stepping?
Brad, stop.
What a jerk.
Sorry, dorks.
Don't take it personal.
Coming, babe?
I got it.
I'm really sorry.
It's not your fault.
We didn't do it. We really didn't.
I believe you.
For the record,
this is Cynthia Cronenberg.
And we're...
Christopher Romero
and James Carpenter Hooper?
Landis, Homicide.
Well, well, well.
If it isn't Spanky and Alfalfa.
Either of you guys
recognize Mr. Miner here?
Well, he recognizes you.
It seems Mr. Miner here
is the night janitor...
...at the University Med Center.
He says he saw you guys
running out of there last night.
Forty miles an hour.
Screaming like banshees.
Care to comment?
Okay.
Seems we also found
a headless body...
...out in front
of the Kappa Delta house last night.
A body that came
from a lab in the basement...
...of the very medical center...
...that Mr. Miner saw you
running out of at 40 miles an hour.
Don't forget
screaming like banshees.
Sounds like a pledge prank to me.
A sick, twisted, psychotic,
demented, deranged pledge prank.
But possibly,
just possibly in the ball park...
...of what you might call
your collegiate tomfoolery.
You guys care to comment?
- Well...
- Captain.
Detective, I mean,
we're not your fraternity types.
I personally
would rather have my brains...
...invaded by creatures from space
than pledge a fraternity.
He's lying. We did it.
- Well, the Betas...
- The Betas.
The Betas.
Well, that explains everything.
The Betas told us to find a body...
...and dump it on the steps
of another fraternity.
Well, we got into the lab
and we got the body out of this thing.
And then we chickened out
and ran away.
At 40 miles an hour.
Screaming like banshees.
It was a nervous response.
- He means the body.
- The body?
It twitched. Its eyes opened.
- I don't know, it spazzed out.
- Spazzed out. Totally.
But I swear to God,
we did not move it from that lab.
And we sure the hell...
...I mean, heck,
didn't damage it in any way.
And even if we did, Mr. Miner here
would've seen us, wouldn't he?
Screaming like banshees.
Yeah, see you tomorrow.
Screaming like banshees.
Kappa Delta.
Is Cindy Cronenberg there?
Just a minute.
Cindy!
Karen?
Has anybody told her about the cat?
It'd break her heart.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Thanks, cutie.
Hello?
Hey, babe. It's the Bradster.
- Listen, about...
- Brad...
...I don't think
I wanna talk to you right now.
Hey, hey, lighten up.
It's about those chuckle-heads,
isn't it?
I mean, it'd be one thing
if you planned to pledge them.
Have a cow about it,
why don't you?
If I knew you were
gonna pull a downer...
...I never even would've told you.
But that's what I get for going
with a fucking psych major, isn't it?
Gordon.
Hi, sweetie. Hi, Gordon.
Thrill me.
Wonderful.
How do you want me
to write this up?
As just a homicide?
Hi.
Hi, hi.
I looked you guys up in the student
directory. I hope you don't mind.
Oh, not at all,
because we were just doing...
I was about to take a shower
and then just...
How's it going?
Wanna come in or just...?
Actually, would a walk
be out of the question?
I know they buried him.
I saw the grave myself.
This is excellent.
Night of the Living Dead Cat.
Look, maybe the girl was on drugs.
You know,
studying can get to you after a while.
Sounds like there's a dance tonight,
the Student Union.
And that guy's body?
The one from the lab?
It came to my window, you guys.
I swear to God.
I thought you'd understand.
I mean, I didn't know who else
to come and talk to about it.
I do understand. We do understand.
I'm so confused.
Listen, you guys.
I really have to use
the nearest facilities...
...so I'll be right back, okay?
All right, go for it, partner.
I mean, she's misplaced
her marble collection...
...but definitely go for it.
Chris, if I tell you something,
you promise to believe me?
Of course.
I think...
...it was a zombie.
And its head exploded...
...and things like slugs
or something spilled out.
Okay.
Maybe I should walk you home.
What about J.C.?
I have a feeling
he went back to the dorms.
Oh, my God.
Oh, shit.
Oh, my God.
Shit.
What the hell was that?
Light.
Come on. Come on.
Okay.
Come on.
Oh, my God.
I feel really stupid.
I don't know.
Maybe I'm going crazy
or something.
Listen,
there's a formal tomorrow night...
...and will you go with me?
What? Really?
Yeah, but what about Brad?
Brad's an asshole.
I know that, but aren't you guys...?
Tomorrow night, okay?
No more weird stuff.
Thanks, Chris.
Good night.
Zombies, exploding heads...
...creepy-crawlies
and a date for the formal.
This is classic, Spanky.
Tell me something, Spanky.
Do you have
a high school sweetheart?
Maybe.
Well, whatever happened to her?
I don't know, I blew it.
She decided we didn't ever need
to talk again...
...and went on with her life, I guess.
Why?
I had a high school sweetheart.
So? What happened to her?
I blew it.
She decided
we didn't ever need to talk again.
Me, I became a cop.
I'd been a rookie about two weeks
when we got the call.
Highway patrol,
they saw a car on the side of the road.
They called it in, we responded.
It was a couple.
The guy's body was in the woods
My partner found him.
I found the girl.
I found her in the car.
And on the road.
And in the woods.
Your high school sweetheart
went on with her life.
Mine got hacked up
by a nutcase with an ax.
But that's not the fun part.
The fun part's what happened next.
What happened next?
Guess.
- The police found him?
- Close.
I found him.
It wasn't what you'd call
your routine police work either.
- What would you call it?
- Revenge.
See, I tracked him
during my off-hours.
By yourself?
Oh, no, no, no.
I took my 12-gauge with me.
I tracked him and I found him.
And when I found him...
...I leveled off that shotgun
right at his chest.
Spanky, guess what happened next.
Should you be telling me this?
Close.
I pulled the trigger.
That's all real exciting
and everything...
...but listen, I've got a mid-term...
I wrapped his body in a plastic bag.
I buried him in a vacant lot.
The lot right behind
your girlfriend's sorority.
Of course,
it isn't a vacant lot anymore.
Now the housemother's cottage
is sitting right on top of it.
Look, detective,
I don't mean to be rude or anything...
...but other than just kind of wanting
to confess to a murder...
...is there a point to this story?
Spanky, that's exactly
what I'm trying to figure out.
The old man left that home,
never to return again.
As long as they can think,
we'll have our problems.
But those whom we're using
cannot think.
They are the dead, brought to a
simulated life by our electro-guns.
You know, it's an interesting thing...
...when you consider,
the Earth people who can think...
...are so frightened
by those who cannot.
Well, our ship should be regenerated.
We better get started.
Thrill me.
Cameron to Dispatch.
Where the hell are my backups?
What the...?
Never mind.
Check the neighborhood. Go ahead.
She had a dog, but it took off
the second we kicked the door in.
If we used a different stretcher
for every piece...
...we'd be here all night.
Forget it. Give it up.
I don't see anything.
A bit more.
We checked the garage, checked
next door, checked that whole side.
- And?
- Nothing.
Check somewhere else.
Don't come back
until you find something.
You're right, this is stupid.
Go.
I said go, not stop.
- Still nothing, sir.
- Wonderful.
Wallace and Teague
are in the patrol car.
Dante and DePalma
are on the other side.
- Reach for Hoffman.
- Detective.
I thought we were...
We've sighted suspect
and we're in pursuit.
Request immediate backup.
Repeat, we have the sucker.
We got him. We got him.
Get the 12-gauge out of my car,
now.
Freeze.
I already killed you.
You son of a bitch,
I already killed you.
- What's going on?
- Oh, Paul, have you seen J.C.?
He never came home last night.
Last time I saw him,
you guys took off with that babe.
Hey, Chris, what's the tux for, huh?
Chris.
There's one inside me.
It got in through my mouth.
I can feel it.
It's in my brain.
I don't have a pulse or a heartbeat.
I think I'm dead.
I killed one.
I lit a match to it.
I think fire will kill them.
I've gone to the furnace room,
the basement.
If I don't come back...
...heat will kill them.
I walked, Chris.
All by myself, I walked.
I love you.
Good luck with Cynthia.
Let's go, bros.
Hey, Cunningham,
where's Brad, man?
I think he's bagging
the formal action.
I think Cindy blew him off.
Oh, bogus, man.
He must be bummed.
Really.
Bitch.
What the fuck?
Hey, dog, did you see that thing?
Let's go, come on.
Let's go.
We're out of here.
Let's blow this pop stand.
We're going to get done, dudes.
What?
They got Alfalfa.
They get in through your mouth...
...and then they lay eggs
in your brain...
...and you walk around
while they incubate.
And you walk around
even if you're dead.
Wonderful.
Come on, you guys.
Settle down or I'll stop the bus.
Hi, Walt.
Well, well, well,
Detective Ray Cameron.
- Son of a gun, is that really you?
- It's me, all right. How's by you?
Hey, can't complain.
Cannot complain, Raymond.
Hi, sport.
Pretty fancy set of duds
you got on there.
What is it, Halloween or something,
Ray? Hey, kid, I'm only kidding.
So, what can I do you for?
Well, the thing is, Walter,
what I need is...
...I need your basic flamethrower.
Flamethrower? Flamethrower?
Yeah.
Flamethrower? Jesus.
What's the matter? The old snub-nose
ain't good enough for you anymore?
Yeah, I know. Just bring out
the old heavy artillery, will you, Walt?
We got one slingshot and one BB gun
and one flamethrower.
There you go.
Gotta watch out for this baby.
Light the pilot, it goes out...
...and it plays hard to get
like a son of a bitch.
- Thanks.
- So if you let me have the requisition.
Oh, well, the thing is...
Oh, the thing is, Walter, I...
I don't have a requisition form
is the thing.
You don't? Well, jeez.
To tell you the truth, Ray,
there could be a little problem.
Yeah.
There could be a little problem.
Well, I'm so sure.
Don't everybody run to answer
the door at once.
Guy.
I'm so sure.
Very hilarious, Brad.
Cindy, Brad's here.
I was gonna call you.
Look,
I'm sorry things didn't work out.
We're just two different people.
That doesn't mean
that it's over forever.
We just need time to think.
Cynthia, get away from it.
Sorry, Brad. Don't take it personal.
Hey, who are you?
I'm gonna call the police.
You do that. Now.
I'm sorry.
I didn't know that it was...
Here, hold this, you'll feel better.
I've got good news
and bad news, girls.
The good news is
your dates are here.
What's the bad news?
They're dead.
Shit.
Oh, shit.
Cynthia, look.
Look,
you squeeze this thing to fire, okay?
Jesus, Cynthia. Try and fire it.
Do something, damn it!
Well, don't go out there.
So fire when I do, okay?
Are you ready?
Now!
You. Lock those doors.
Duck.
It's Miller time.
Don't these creeps
take no for an answer?
How many of them are there?
Come on, come on. Shoot him.
It's jammed.
Give me a fucking break.
Here, come on.
Real good plan.
Oh, my God.
Chris.
Chris. Chris.
Chris.
Get out of there.
Go.
Later, dude.
Holy shit, the basement.
What's in the basement?
Storage, boxes.
One of the girl's science projects.
- Oh, my...
- Get out of the house.
Get out of the house.
Get out of the house now.
No, no. Get out.
Get out, get out of here.
Take her and get out.
Get the hell out of here.
Wonderful.
Don't even think about it,
you little son of a bitch.
Twenty.
Nineteen.
Eighteen.
Seventeen.
Sixteen.
Thirteen, 12, 11.
Ten, nine...
...eight, seven...
...six...
Five, four, three...
One.
Detective, thrill me.
Nice tux.
