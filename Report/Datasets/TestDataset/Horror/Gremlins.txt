RAND:
Friends, let me introduce myself.
Peltzer's the name.
Rand Peltzer.
That's me there on the corner.
I'm an inventor.
And I have a story to tell.
I know.
Who hasn't got a story?
Well, nobody's got a story
like this one.
Nobody.
lt all started here in Chinatown.
I was trying
to move a little merchandise...
...maybe find a present
for my kid.
I tried this one place.
Wait a minute.
RAND:
What's down here?
This is it.
This is your grandfather's store?
Come on.
RAND: No wonder you gotta drag
people in off the street.
Go ahead, mister.
Look around.
See if there's something you like.
Are these things real?
BOY:
I told you, everything's real.
You do have
interesting artifacts here...
...but there's one thing
you don't have.
BOY:
And what's that?
Let me show you.
I'm an inventor. l made this.
The Bathroom Buddy.
The invention of the century.
It eliminates the need to carry
heavy luggage when you travel.
You got yourself
your shaving mirror...
...your toothbrush, a toothpick.
You got toenail clippers...
...a nail file...
...and you got yourself
a dental mirror.
This is gonna revolutionize traveling.
Let's just say,
for the sake of argument...
...that you're on a bus,
a plane or a train.
You forgot to brush your teeth.
You got yourself a bad case
of dragon breath.
Bad breath.
What do you do?
No problem, friend.
All you do is...
...you take your toothbrush out...
...and you push this button.
That's absolutely no problem.
Cleans up easily.
What l'd like to do, sir,
is give you my card.
Rand Peltzer. "Fantastic Ideas
for a Fantastic World."
I make the illogical logical.
I can get you these.
I can get them by the dozen
if you'd like.
What do you think?
RAND:
Where's that coming from?
What is that?
BOY:
Mogwai.
What's he doing?
Singing.
He does that sometimes.
I gotta have him.
He's incredible.
Tell you what l'll do.
-l'll give you $1 00 for him.
GRANDFATHER: No.
RAND: I've gotta have him. lt's
a present for my son for Christmas.
It's what I've been looking for.
I've been everywhere.
I'll give you $200.
That's $200!
I'm sorry.
Mogwai not for sale.
RAND:
You said everything here was for sale.
Grandfather!
With mogwai comes much responsibility.
I cannot sell him at any price.
Wait outside. I'll be right out.
Just go.
Okay, mister, here it is.
What about your grandfather?
Forget what he said. He's crazy.
We need the money.
Do you want it or not?
I want it.
BOY: There's three rules
you've gotta follow.
RAND:
What kind of rules?
BOY:
Keep him out of the light.
He hates bright light,
especially sunlight.
It'll kill him.
And keep him away from water.
Don't get him wet.
But the most important rule,
the rule you can never forget...
...no matter how much he cries
or how much he begs...
...never, never feed him
after midnight. Got it?
RAND:
Sure. Whatever you say.
Thanks.
And have a merry Christmas.
DJ OVER RADIO: You're rolling with
Rockin' Ricky Rialto...
...the voice of Kingston Falls, U.S.A.!
FRANK:
Alex....
Getting close to Christmas.
You'll get stuck
with a lot of trees again.
ALEX: I thought I'd see you about now.
PETE: Ow!
What the hell is this?
What are you doing in there?
PETE:
Don't ask.
Alex, l came to get my tree.
Pete, take that tree
to Mr. Anderson's truck.
What do you say, Alex?
You can spare one
for the sheriff's station.
I paid for mine, Frank.
FUTTERMAN:
Billy, you need a jump?
No, thanks, Mr. Futterman.
I'm late for work as it is.
These goddamn foreign cars
always freeze up on you.
You don't find American
machinery doing that.
See that plow?
Hasn't given me a day's trouble
in 1 5 years.
You know why?
Kentucky Harvester.
It ain't some foreign piece of crap.
That's a Kentucky Harvester.
If l wanna keep my job,
I should be going now.
How's your comic strip coming?
I expect to see you in the funnies
with "Smilin' Jack," "Li'l Abner."
They don't run those comics anymore.
They don't?
BlLLY:
Come on, Barn.
Say hello to your wife, okay?
So long, Billy.
Goddamn foreign cars.
BlLLY:
Hey, doctor.
DOCTOR:
Morning, Billy.
BlLLY: Morning, Tom.
GUARD: Hey, Billy. Barney.
BlLLY:
Get in there and be quiet.
-You just made it.
-Again.
Will you sign this petition?
Sure. What's it for?
To declare Dorry's pub a landmark.
Mrs. Deagle's trying to take
his lease away.
His too?
Yeah, she says it's a dive,
a public nuisance.
That's where my dad
proposed to my mom.
That's where everybody's dad
proposed to their mom. Cross your "T."
Thanks.
Good morning, Mrs. Deagle.
What's good about it?
Klutz!
Watch it, watch it!
Two hundred. Thank you.
-Mrs. Deagle?
-What?
I just wanted you to know
that Joe got another job.
My husband, Joe Harris.
And l've taken up some sewing.
What are you trying to tell me?
Neither of us will be paid
for two weeks.
Couldn't you get Mr. Corben...
...to give us a little more time?
Mrs. Harris...
...the bank and l have
the same purpose in life...
...to make money.
Not to support a lot of...
...deadbeats.
MRS. HARRlS:
Mrs. Deagle, it's Christmas!
Now you know what to ask Santa for,
don't you?
Mommy, l'm hungry.
Yes, honey. So am l.
This is what's left
of my imported Bavarian snowman.
Your dog broke it this morning!
I'm terribly sorry.
Tell me how much l owe you--
I don't want money.
I want your dog.
Barney?
Give him to me.
I'll take him to the kennel.
They'll put him to sleep.
It'll be quick and painless,
compared to what l could do to him.
What could you do?
I'll catch the beast myself.
Then he'll get what he deserves.
A slow, painful death.
Maybe I'll put him in my spin dryer
on high heat.
That'd do it.
Barney!
BlLLY:
Barney, will you get off of her?
CORBEN:
My dear lady, are you all right?
I have a very weak heart.
I can't stand a shock like that!
What is that dog doing in here?
This is a bank, not a pet store.
Very good, Gerald.
He wouldn't hurt you.
Excuses, excuses.
You're just like your father.
I've listened to his excuses
for 1 0 years, the loser!
As for you, you mangy cur...
...l'll get you...
...when you least expect it!
Oh, my heart!
I must apologize
for this most unusual....
You putz.
JONES:
The old bat never looked better.
It's great. You're doing fine.
BlLLY:
Thanks.
JONES:
Hello, Gerald.
If it isn't Captain Clip-on.
Guess who almost applied
for unemployment today?
-l give up.
-You.
But Mr. Corben had second thoughts.
He gets so sentimental
about the holidays.
Imagine that.
I would've fired you in a second.
Merry Christmas to you too.
Excuse me, Mr. Jones.
GERALD:
Hey, Peltzer.
Look, l'm a junior
vice president at 23.
By the time l'm 25,
I'm gonna have Mr. Corben's job.
By the time l'm 30,
I'll be a millionaire.
Look at you.
You're practically supporting
your whole family.
The world's changing.
You gotta change with it.
You gotta be tough.
Tough? And no one's
tougher than you, Ger?
Don't call me that.
My name's Gerald.
Can l get you a drink?
Give me a vodka martini.
Shake, don't stir.
BlLLY:
You work here?
Weeknights so Dorry doesn't
have to pay an extra waitress.
That's great.
GERALD: Yeah, that's swell, if you
like working for nothing.
Two more rounds for the pool table,
on the house.
You haven't seen my new apartment.
I haven't seen your old apartment.
We're talking cable.
Can we have dinner tomorrow night?
I'm working.
GERALD: Why don't you tell Dorry
you're sick? He can't dock your pay.
LYNN:
Billy, is that you?
Yeah, Mom, it's me.
LYNN:
I'm in the kitchen.
Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas, movie house!
Merry Christmas, emporium!
-Hi, Mom.
-Hi, sweetie.
Do you need any help?
Yeah, you could do the eggs.
Thanks.
Dad's machines work so well
the first couple of weeks, then....
Use the sink.
Is something wrong?
No, it's a sad movie.
How was your day?
It was fine.
Come on, what is it?
What's wrong?
Mrs. Deagle called again
this afternoon.
Let's not talk about it now.
Don't say anything to Dad.
Fine with me.
LYNN:
Hi, sweetheart!
-Welcome home.
-Hey, Dad.
I'm glad you're back.
How was the trip?
It was great.
The Miracle Company, who has
the Kitchen Companion...
...might be interested
in the Bathroom Buddy.
Great!
-Thanks!
-You'll like this.
What is it? A birdcage?
No, don't shake it. Open it now.
It won't wait till Christmas.
It's a puppy, isn't it?
Yeah, l can tell.
It's a new car.
-Honey, would you dim the lights?
-Sure.
Dim the lights?
Does it glow in the dark?
It's important. Trust me.
RAND:
Go ahead, open it.
What is it?
RAND:
It's your new pet.
Come on, Barney.
Be a good dog.
BlLLY:
You're kidding.
Dad, it's really neat.
Where'd you get this?
RAND:
Some little junk store in Chinatown.
-Can l pick him up?
-Sure, go ahead. Just be careful.
-You gotta be gentle.
-l will.
LYNN:
I hope he's housebroken.
Isn't he cute?
Has it got a name?
RAND:
Mogwai.
-What?
RAND: Mogwai.
Some Chinese word.
I just call him...
...Gizmo.
He seems to like it.
Look up here a minute.
We're getting our picture taken.
Smile.
Ready?
One, two, three....
RAND: No, no.
GIZMO: Bright light!
What happened?
RAND:
He hates bright lights.
There's some important things
I forgot to tell you.
Number one, he hates bright lights.
You gotta keep him out of the sunlight.
Sunlight will kill him.
Number two, keep him
away from water.
Don't give him any water to drink.
Whatever you do, don't give him a bath.
And the most important thing...
...don't ever feed him
after midnight.
Shh!
Looks like you hurt yourself.
GIZMO:
Light bright! Light bright!
Just sit down there
and don't fall off, okay?
I'll get you fixed up in no time.
All right.
Hold still.
Sorry. Sorry.
Try not to move so much, okay?
Good night, Giz.
I'll see you in the morning.
PETE:
Hello!
Mrs. Peltzer?
I got a tree!
Oh, Christ!
Billy!
I just brought in
your Christmas tree.
What happened?
Slight problem
with the Peltzer Peeler-Juicer.
I thought your dad fixed it.
I thought so too.
You should just buy orange juice
in cartons. It's a lot easier.
See, it works.
BARBARA STANWYCK: I had to come.
CLARK GABLE: So I see.
Now l can see. It takes...
...a certain kind of guy.
And that guy needs
a certain kind of dame.
BlLLY: lt's no problem, Pete.
Leave it up here.
What'll you tell him?
PETE: l'll just tell him a bunch of
bikers stole it from me on my way home.
Wow! The Hooded Menace.
Issue number one!
Pretty neat, huh?
Where'd you get it?
Dr. Fantasy's, l think.
-What's that?
-Come here. l'll show you.
This is my new pet.
My dad gave him to me.
Neat! What's his name?
His name's Gizmo. Hi, Giz.
He's a mogwai.
PETE:
Cute!
Blink your eyes.
Go like that.
Can you do that?
BlLLY:
Watch. Maybe he'll sing.
Come on, Giz.
Let's go over to the table.
I'll be careful.
There we go.
Gee, Billy, where
can l get one of those?
I don't know.
This is the only one l've ever seen.
Can l hold him?
Sure. l don't see why not.
He seems to like you.
Great! Thanks a lot.
PETE:
Sorry.
What was in that jar?
BlLLY:
Nothing! Just water!
Why is he making that noise?
What is it?
BlLLY:
I don't know.
Is it alive?
I don't know.
One, two, three,
four, five new ones.
Now can l have one?
BlLLY:
I don't know.
PETE: Look, that one's got
a cute stripe on its head.
Isn't that incredible, Pete?
PETE:
Yeah, great.
Don't you think this--?
This is incredible!
Oh, it is neat.
I'm serious. lt's neat.
BlLLY:
Gizmo, what's the matter?
-No, no, no.
-Hey, Dad?
-There's something l should tell you.
-Look.
You're familiar
with the Bathroom Buddy?
I have made an improvement.
Watch this.
Now, let's say you're
late for the big meeting.
It's really important.
You're on your way. You reach up.
You forgot to shave.
What're you gonna do?
Under normal circumstances...
...you are in trouble.
But not if you have
the Bathroom Buddy.
Watch this.
What do you think?
That's pretty neat.
What's this button?
-Sorry, Dad.
-lt's okay.
I'm sorry.
It's not your fault. l'm working
on that. I haven't finished that.
I came up here because
there's a problem with the mogwai.
Yeah, what's that?
It multiplies with water.
What?
BlLLY:
Do you see what I mean?
I don't believe that.
All that from water?
They got wet?
Plain water.
BlLLY: lt's funny.
The new ones aren't like Gizmo.
The striped one
seems to be the leader.
RAND:
You know what?
I'll bet every kid in America
would like one of these.
They might replace
the dog as the family pet.
RAND:
Think about it.
The Peltzer Pet.
This could really be the big one.
Barn?
Barney?
Barney, who did this to you?
Hold on, I'll get you down.
Stay still.
Poor dog. Another minute
and he would've been a dog-sicle.
All I know is that l'm positive
that I closed and locked the door.
How else did she get to him?
We can't point any fingers,
not even at Mrs. Deagle.
She's been threatening him.
She'd love to get her hands on him.
We don't have proof. We can't even
find footprints leading up to the house.
I'm gonna take Barney
to your grandmother's.
Take him there on the way to the
convention, pick him up on the way home.
He'll be here for Christmas.
It'll be all right.
I don't think we can drink this.
Why not?
What's wrong with this?
Hey, Billy.
Is that a mogwai?
Yeah, l'm gonna have
Mr. Hanson check it out.
BlLLY: And all of a sudden, there were
five new ones like this one.
Now watch this.
Can l keep one of these here,
run some tests on him?
BlLLY:
I think I can spare one.
FUTTERMAN: This is some Christmas,
Katie, l'll tell you.
First the old bat closes the factory,
and now it's my goddamn plow.
KATE: Mr. Futterman, guess what?
It's time to go home now.
-How about one more beer?
-No, it's late.
One more beer,
I'll help you clean up.
No, thanks, though.
It'll be okay.
-lt'll be okay.
-lt will not be okay.
I brought my plow in for a tune-up
and found it loaded with foreign parts.
I mean, everything.
Gaskets, pistons, spark plugs.
All of it's foreign.
FUTTERMAN: Billy!
BlLLY: Hi.
BlLLY:
Going home?
Oh, yeah.
Gremlins!
You gotta watch out for foreigners.
They plant gremlins
in their machinery.
The same gremlins brought down
our planes in the big one.
That's right.
World War II.
Good old...
...W-W-l-l.
They're still shipping them over here.
They put them in the cars, the TV.
They put them in the radios
you stick in your ears.
They put them in the watches.
Little teeny gremlins.
It's not a good idea that you drive.
Why don't you walk home?
You know, Katie, l think
maybe I'll walk home.
-Good.
-lt's a nice night.
-Good night, kids.
-Good night.
Gremlins.
That was really good,
the way you handled Mr. Futterman.
I'm used to it.
He's been like that
ever since he lost his job.
He's like a lot of people around here.
He just wants somebody to listen.
Especially around the holidays.
Why is that?
It's when a lot of people
get really depressed.
I always thought everyone was happy
during the holidays, no matter what.
Most people are, but some aren't.
While everybody else opens up presents,
they're opening up their wrists.
Cheery thought.
It's true. The suicide rate's
always the highest around the holidays.
Now I'm depressed.
Do you ever get depressed on Christmas?
I don't celebrate Christmas.
Are you Hindu or something?
No, I just don't like to.
What's not to like?
I mean, it's a lot of fun.
God!
Say you hate Thanksgiving,
and nobody cares.
But say you hate Christmas, everybody
makes you feel like you're a leper.
BlLLY: l'm sorry.
KATE: lt's okay.
I'm sorry. I'm just
a little tired and cranky.
BlLLY:
Yeah.
Thanks for walking me home.
No problem.
-Good night.
-Good night.
Kate?
I was just wondering, do you
get any free nights off from Dorry's?
Thursdays.
Thursdays, yeah.
Because I was just wondering...
...if you're free this Thursday night,
maybe you'd like to go out on a date...
...with me?
I'd love to.
Oh, yeah?
Well, that's great!
We can talk about it
on the phone and kind of...
...square everything away.
Good night, Billy.
'Night.
Hey there.
Give me your arm, boy.
Come here, come on.
Give me your arm.
No, this is not gonna hurt.
This isn't gonna hurt.
Not a big guy like you. Come on.
There you go.
See, that's not so bad. Come on.
Good, good.
Oh, that's good.
Just a little blood test, pal.
You'll never miss it.
They're like huge seedpods!
-Having fun?
-Fun!
Pretty neat, huh?
Neat!
GREMLlNS:
Yum, yum! Yum, yum!
How about shutting up
for a change, okay?
I already fed you.
Well, it's not 12:00 yet.
All right. Keep an eye on them, Giz.
I'll be back in a second.
Here we go.
Now maybe you guys will be quiet.
You guys are really hungry.
Giz, you want some?
Do you want some chicken?
No?
All right.
Yum, yum.
That's it, good buddy.
Call it a night.
Can't you see?
They're after you!
They're after all of us!
Our wives, our children, everyone!
They're here already!
You're next!
You're next!
You're next! You're next!
GIZMO:
Uh-oh.
BlLLY: Mom?
LYNN: Yeah?
Mom, could you come up here, please?
LYNN: Then l want you to bring
the vacuum cleaner upstairs for me.
LYNN:
What are they?
Well, they're the mogwai, I guess.
Except for Gizmo.
LYNN:
Did you get them wet?
No.
Did you feed them
after midnight?
Well, l gave them
some chicken.
But l made sure that it--
No, no, no. Wait a minute.
I made sure....
Mom?
What's going on here?
PETE:
Yuck!
What'd you say this was called?
A putrid stage?
Pupal. Pupal stage.
Like a butterfly.
Yeah, right.
This is a cocoon, and inside
he's going through changes.
Lots of changes.
Like my mother.
No, that's different.
This is called a metamorphosis.
It's a change in form...
...and in appearance.
Hello?
Hello? Hi, honey!
No, I'm sure it works fine.
I was just out on the back porch
for a second.
The convention's great.
I said it's great!
Actually, the competition's....
ROBOT:
Sorry, miss.
The competition's a little more
advanced than I expected.
ROBOT: l was changing my oil.
RAND: Some really neat things.
LYNN:
Oh, Rand.
You've never been so far
away on Christmas Eve before.
I know it's Christmas Eve.
I'll do the best l can.
All right. Bye-bye.
MRS. HARRlS:
All I could get for it was $36!
If there's anything I can do....
But it's completely out of my hands.
I'll be delighted--
Hello, Gerald.
I'm under such terrible pressure.
Why don't you just
speak to Mrs. Deagle about it?
Speak to Mrs. Deagle?
Mrs. Deagle!
Deposit this to my account.
Where's that psychotic canine?
Still hiding under the counter?
No, I'm afraid he's on vacation.
Better keep him behind locked doors,
because if l catch him...
...he's in for a slow death.
Here's Mr. Bird's heart.
Small animals lose heat
faster than large ones.
Their blood must circulate
faster to keep their bodies warm.
Now, in small birds...
...their hearts beat
about 600 times per minute.
Cats, 1 30.
Man, about 75...
...and a big old elephant's heart,
only 25 a minute.
Hey, doc, you
got a human heart?
Has he got a human heart?
Wait till you see this! Roll 1 0.
HANSON: Okay, class.
Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas.
If any of you wanna bring me
a present...
...a cassette deck wouldn't be bad.
Of course, tickets to the Super Bowl
would be very nice.
PETE: Mr. Hanson, wait.
Let me just talk to you for a second.
PETE:
Bye.
Billy....
It just hatched.
I'll be right there.
Hey there.
You remember me?
Remember me, don't you?
I went and got you...
...a candy bar.
I thought you might be hungry.
You hungry?
You should try one of these.
Hey there.
Come here. Don't be afraid.
There's no reason to be afraid.
Where'd you go?
Where are you?
I know you're in there.
I know you're under there.
Come on, now.
You're not still angry
about that little blood test, are you?
Come on out.
Take a bite. Let me see you.
I just wanna see you.
You try some of this now.
I know you gotta be hungry.
GREMLlN:
Yum, yum.
There now. Don't you feel better?
Mr. Hanson?
GREMLlN:
Yum, yum.
STRlPE:
Gizmo ca-ca!
Billy, are you okay?
Where are you?
Mom, they hatched.
Get out of the house.
GREMLlN:
Phone home. Ca-ca!
Mom? Mom!
Yum, yum.
Get out of my kitchen!
Neat!
Hey!
-Are you all right?
-l think so.
BlLLY:
Mom, it's Stripe!
-Should l get it?
-Yeah, go ahead and get it.
Oh, l didn't mean that.
BlLLY:
Hello, Dr. Molinaro. Can we come in?
My mom's had a bit of an accident.
LYNN:
Be careful!
DOCTOR:
What happened?
Giz?
GIZMO:
Bright light! Bright light!
Come here.
They almost got you, huh?
Climb in here.
ROBOT: The question is
totally without meaning.
Pardon me, sir. Stuff.
Thick and heavy.
Would 60 gallons be sufficient?
I rarely use it myself, sir.
It promotes rust.
BlLLY:
Don't worry, Giz, we'll find him.
Gremlins, huh?
BlLLY: Little monsters.
-Right.
-Hundreds of them?
-l'm not sure. Maybe thousands.
Look, l know it sounds crazy.
I know it does.
But in a matter of hours,
this town's gonna be a disaster area.
You've got to warn people!
-You think this kid is drunk?
-No, but you are.
I am not drunk!
Tell me something. Where do
these little gremlins come from?
All right.
My father gave me one as a present.
Does your father always
give you vicious little monsters?
No, they don't
start out vicious at first!
Of course not.
They don't!
They look like this.
Could you dim the lights?
Sure.
Go ahead, Brent.
Dim the lights.
STRlPE:
Gusto!
Right, Murray?
Sheila, will you quit messing
with the TV?
You have the thingy.
Goddamn foreign TV.
We should've got a Zenith!
Foreigners.
I can't get a damn thing on this!
Where are you going?
I'm gonna check the antenna.
Maybe the damn thing blew down.
Be careful, dear.
What the hell is that?
-lt's them!
-You're crazy!
There's a real gremlin in my cab!
Hello, Anderson.
Wanna mail something, do you?
Just a last-minute package, Father.
Be my guest.
That's strange.
FRANK:
Patriotic little fellow, ain't he?
Waving the flag and everything.
Be careful, Frank!
He might tear your arm off.
You want me to put the cuffs on him?
FRANK: Tell me. How come
a cute guy like this...
...can turn into
a thousand ugly monsters?
You see, this is before
it enters the pupal stage.
It multiplies with water.
FRANK: Get the kid some water.
BlLLY: l wouldn't do that.
FRANK:
Sheriff's office.
Yeah, speaking.
What?
Oh, no.
Yeah, sure, we'll be right over.
BRENT:
What happened?
The Futtermans.
Something about a snowplow.
A freak accident.
BlLLY:
It's the creatures!
The creatures are making it
look like an accident!
Will you listen to me?
You listen to me, kid!
Go on home, take little Gizmo...
...sit by the fireplace
and open your Christmas presents.
Attaboy.
BRENT: Let me drive.
FRANK: No, you're drunk.
BRENT:
You always drive!
FRANK:
Because I'm the sheriff, asshole.
Kopeck, you stop that, you bad kitty!
Kopeck's a bad kitty.
Ruble's a good little kitty.
We'll find you something to eat.
She's a good kitty.
Here we go. Here we go. Come on.
All right, you stop that!
Stop it!
Mean kitty, you start eating
before everybody gets here.
Come on, Dollar Bill.
Yes, here we go, Dollar Bill.
Mommy'll fix you
something good to eat.
Everybody here?
All right, let go of Mommy's coat.
Here.
Christmas carolers.
I hate Christmas carolers.
Screechy-voiced little glue-sniffers.
I warned you brats!
Ya-ya-ya! Ya-ya-ya!
What are they?
What are they?!
They're here!
They've come for me!
They've come!
I'm not ready.
I'm not ready yet.
I'm not ready!
My God, Frye!
That was Mrs. Deagle.
Get them off! Get them off! Help me!
That's Dave Myers.
He does Santa every year.
What the hell is he doing now?
What's that stuff he's
got all over him?
Frank, l really think
we should go now.
Start the car. I'd really like
to go back to the station.
BRENT:
Please!
BRENT:
Frank!
Jesus, Frank!
What the hell are those things?
It's Christmas.
What the hell's going on?
Shut up, will you?!
I don't believe it.
DJ OVER RADIO:
You're on with Rockin' Ricky! Go!
PETE:
Hi, my name's Pete.
These green guys are
running around wrecking things.
DJ:
This is Christmas, not Halloween!
Listen, gang.
Rockin' Ricky's getting fed up
with this Orson Welles crap!
What's that? Kitty, what's that?
Some of Rockin' Ricky fans?
You're not a Rockin' Ricky fan!
Sir, l notice that you're a smoker.
I notice that you're a smoker.
I see the cigarettes.
I noticed, here, this broken ashtray.
It's very fortunate
that I happened to come by.
Let me introduce myself. My name's
Randall Peltzer. l'm an inventor.
"Fantastic ldeas for a Fantastic World."
I make the illogical logical.
I have something here that l think
you might be interested in.
Yes, sir, I do.
This is...
...the Peltzer Smokeless Ashtray.
I think this can solve
your problem here, sir.
Please don't bite me!
Wait a minute.
BlLLY:
You all right?
Let's get out of here!
KATE:
What's that?
Don't worry. He's with me.
He's not one of them.
What's wrong?
Why isn't the car starting?
We're gonna have to
make a run for it, okay?
One, two, three!
KATE:
They've been here too.
What are these things?
Where do they come from?
BlLLY:
They're gremlins, Kate.
Just like Mr. Futterman said.
KATE: Now l have another reason
to hate Christmas.
What are you talking about?
The worst thing that ever
happened to me was on Christmas.
Oh, God. lt was so horrible.
It was Christmas Eve.
I was 9 years old.
Me and Mom were decorating the tree...
...waiting for Dad
to come home from work.
A couple hours went by.
Dad wasn't home.
So Mom called the office.
No answer.
Christmas Day came and went,
and still nothing.
So the police began a search.
Four or five days went by.
Neither one of us
could eat or sleep.
Everything was falling apart.
It was snowing outside.
The house was freezing, so l went
to try to light up the fire.
That's when I noticed the smell.
The firemen came and
broke through the chimney top.
And me and Mom were expecting
them to pull out a dead cat or a bird.
And instead they pulled out my father.
He was dressed
in a Santa Claus suit.
He'd been climbing down the chimney...
...his arms loaded with presents.
He was gonna surprise us.
He slipped and broke his neck.
He died instantly.
And that's how l found out
there was no Santa Claus.
Don't worry about that smoke.
It'll stop. It's guaranteed.
Barney, shut up!
Don't start with me.
I got a long way to go.
Shut up!
KATE:
Where did they all go?
BlLLY:
It'll be light soon.
I bet they're all
together someplace dark.
GIZMO:
Mogwai!
BlLLY:
Shh, Gizmo.
They're inside.
All of them?
Milk Duds.
KATE:
What are they doing?
They're watching Snow White.
And they love it.
Where's the boiler room?
It's in the back of the theater.
Down there.
Milk Duds.
STRlPE:
Yum, yum.
BlLLY: Cover your mouth.
Don't breathe any gas.
KATE:
Billy!
Go.
KATE:
Billy!
Billy!
-Hurry up!
-Move, Katie! Watch out!
Come on!
KATE:
Billy....
In the department store.
BlLLY:
Stripe!
That's Stripe.
He's the leader.
If he gets to water,
it'll start all over again.
Take Giz, go back and try
and find some kind of light switch.
Careful, Billy.
MALE VOlCE OVER P.A.:
Ward is your snowplow headquarters.
FEMALE VOlCE OVER P.A.:
Attention, Christmas shoppers.
Saturday morning at 8:30, we'll have
Santa Claus for all the kiddies.
We have the Kingston Falls....
Attention, shoppers.
GIZMO:
Light bright!
STRlPE:
Bye-bye.
BARBARA STANWYCK:
It takes a certain kind of guy.
CLARK GABLE: And that guy needs
a certain kind of dame.
Water!
Gun!
DJ OVER RADIO: It's been a rough night
for Rockin' Ricky...
...but he's still on the air!
The Marines are standing by
with fire hoses.
STRlPE:
Billy.
STRlPE:
Gizmo ca-ca!
GIZMO:
Light bright! Light bright!
RAND:
What the hell is that?
Your scarf.
NEWSCASTER OVER TV:
We switch to a report...
...from the scene of
the Christmas Eve riots.
This is Lew Landers,
WDHB's Action Central News...
...at the site of Dorry's Tavern...
...or what used to be Dorry's Tavern,
in Kingston Falls...
...where officials blame...
...mass hysteria for the escalating
series of unexplained...
...accidents, fires and explosions
that rocked this once-peaceful town...
...on Christmas Eve.
The bizarre demise
of Mrs. Ruby Deagle, widow...
...of convicted stock-swindler
Donald Deagle....
KATE:
Don't chew that.
Don't chew.
I bet he'd like
some chicken soup.
Honey, this is the gentleman
who sold me the mogwai.
"Sold." An interesting choice of words.
Conflicting eyewitness reports
concerning "little green men"....
You teach him to watch television?
There was, I believe, a box.
Dad....
Rand, your scarf.
I warned you.
With mogwai comes much responsibility.
But you didn't listen.
And you see what happens.
I didn't mean it.
You do with mogwai what your society...
...has done with all of nature's gifts.
You do not understand.
You are not ready.
GIZMO: Papa?
GRANDFATHER: Yes?
He has something to say to you.
You understand what
he says when he speaks to you?
To hear, one has only to listen.
Bye, Billy.
Perhaps someday you may be ready.
Until then, mogwai...
...will be waiting.
Excuse me, sir.
Before you go, l wanted to tell you...
...that l am truly sorry
for what's happened.
And if you would accept it,
I'd like to...
...give you this small token.
There's one other one.
This is an invention of mine.
Smokeless Ashtray.
How did you know?
Man at gas station tried to sell me.
Latest word in technology.
Very generous of you.
I'm sure it will come in handy.
GIZMO:
Bye-bye, woof-woof.
RAND:
Well, that's the story.
So if your air conditioner goes on the
fritz, your washing machine blows up...
...or your video recorder conks out...
...before you call the repairman...
...turn on the lights,
check the closets and cupboards...
...look under all the beds.
Because you never can tell.
There just might be
a gremlin in your house.
