MAN: Come on, Lucy.
Pick up the phone. Pick up.
Pick up. Pick up.
Pick up. Pick up. Pick up.
- Hey, it's Lucy.
- Ah, hello, Lucy.
-
- Er, hello, answering machine.
It's me, Tom.
Remember?
We met a couple of weeks ago.
Think you were chatting
me up at the bar.
Yeah, so I was thinking
there was this festival
this weekend in Ireland
that I'm going to,
and I thought maybe...
okay, I'll call later, actually.
-
-
Hey, it's Lucy.
TOM: Listen, I didn't...
about this weekend,
I didn't mean just you and I.
It's not like a date or anything.
It's... there's going to be, like,
a whole bunch of us camping.
So, yeah, bring some friends,
if you have any,
just in case we don't get along,
which we would, if you came.
Hello?
Quick. Quick. Let's get out of here.
Here, close the door.
That was a nice pub.
I think I counted 12 men,
seven dogs,
no women, and me.
I thought since the festival
doesn't start tonight,
there's no bands playing,
for a special treat...
I've booked a hotel.
- Ah.
- Mm-hmm.
- You cheeky fuck.
- Ow.
Fore... okay, we've started
already foreplay.
You said we were going up
to the festival tonight.
- That was the plan.
- Yes...
Now I have friends
up there camping,
thinking we're on our way.
It's our two-week anniversary.
Remember?
Oh, you can't have
a two-week anniversary.
It's a nice hotel.
Look in the glove box.
I printed out some stuff
from the website.
Go on, look at it.
"Your slice of paradise
in the Emerald Isle."
Mm-hmm. That's why I booked it.
Forgot to say
you look really nice today.
Okay. Let's go.
You mean it?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
We have to wait here until 7:00,
and then someone's gonna come
and show us the way.
That's what I arranged.
What if I said no?
I thought I was being
vaguely romantic.
Ah.
That's him?
I guess so.
All right, wait.
Whew.
LUCY: You know, I was chatted up
on the way to the toilet.
Oh, yeah?
Barman thought that I was
a "strong, fine-looking
young thing."
That's a good line.
What? You want me to go back?
You want me to go back
and have words?
I'll have a stern word
in that man's ear.
I'll take him outside, and I'll hit him
right in the middle of the forehead.
Well, whilst you were on the
toilet, some guy bumped into me
and spilt my drink all over me,
on my new jumper.
And then I ended up buying him
and all his friends a drink.
The whole pub?
Why?
Well, he bumped into me,
spilt my drink on me,
so I was like, "Excuse me,"
and he said it wasn't his fault,
and I said,
"Well, it wasn't my fault."
And then it got a bit weird,
and then he did offer
to buy me a drink,
but by that point,
I was like, "Well, look,
I'll buy you
and your friends a drink,"
just to keep things calm.
'Cause I'm a lover.
I'm not a fighter.
What?
Oh, okay.
LUCY: Yeah, nice to meet you.
Tom, no! He could have seen you.
- Oh.
- Don't be rude like that.
TOM: That's really weird.
Do you want some help?
Fine!
Whoo!
Yeah, yeah. Very funny, Lucy.
Ugh.
- Got dirty hands now.
- Ugh.
- Stay away. Ugh.
- Huh?
- Huh? Huh?
- No. Ugh.
Huh? Huh?
TOM: Idiots.
They're the guys from the pub?
Think so.
- LUCY: I need to make a phone call.
- Fine.
I don't know where I am, actually.
Tom booked a hotel,
so I'm not going
to be there tonight.
I've talked with him.
It's a sad field.
How can a field be sad?
I don't know. Just is.
Oh, look. There's an angry tree.
There's some worried mud.
-
-
- What?
- I just went over a grumpy stone.
LUCY: Whoa, whoa. Stop.
Map says to go that way.
- The sign says that way.
- Yeah, but if...
you know, if they're different,
we should check.
Or we just follow the signs.
TOM: We could just
throw the map away.
Look, it says Kilairney House
Hotel on the left.
All right, I'm going.
Thought I saw someone.
Oh, yeah?
Was that the end of the story?
You don't have your map out.
Just following the signs now?
- I'm giving you a little bit of time.
- I win.
- LUCY: Can't see what it says.
- TOM: It says "Kilairney House."
LUCY: They're hidden a little bit.
- This way.
- Yeah.
LUCY: Oh.
That's...
LUCY:
Um... that's wrong.
What does the map say?
I don't know. Can't see
with this fucking orange blob.
- Well, we followed the signs.
- I'm going to call the hotel.
He's going to say follow the signs.
We may as well just turn round
and phone back when we come back.
- Hey...
-
- ow... fuck.
- Sorry.
- I have... sorry.
-
We've got a reservation
for tonight,
but we've been
following the signs...
We've been following the signs
but we've got lost.
LUCY: Shh! And we don't know
where to go.
We've been trying to find
the way for a little bit.
- Um... well, there's...
-
they've got two signs, and...
Yeah, no, that's what we've been doing,
but now it's telling us to go back.
Yeah, and I was trying to map
read, but it was saying different
to what the signs were saying.
Hello?
They just hung up.
- Hey, I'm going to go...
- It's not ringing back.
- I'm going back, okay?
- Well, no... he was in mid-conversation.
It hung up. I'm just going
to try to call back.
- Um...
- I'm going to go.
- I'm going.
- Come on.
- No, wait. I have to...
- I'm going.
Shit.
It's not answering.
I don't have any signal.
LUCY: The Land Rover.
Wait, wait, wait.
Stop him. Stop him.
- Hey! Hey!
- Hey! Hey! Hey!
Well, it must be that way.
- What do you mean? Why?
- That's the way he came from.
- So what?
- So it's that way,
'cause he must have come
from the hotel.
Yeah, but no. He left us
before we went into the...
through the gate.
Yeah, well, he's obviously
gone and got someone,
and then he's going back...
he's gone back,
and he's going back
to get someone else.
Ah.
"Kilairney House Hotel"
left.
Well, it says the hotel's
meant to be secluded,
so... must be...
How can we be back
at this bit again?
You must have done something wrong.
We haven't done anything wrong.
Followed the signs.
Well, let's just go
back to the pub,
and they can send someone
to meet us there.
Okay. Let's do that.
LUCY: This isn't the way we came.
We're going back.
We can't be.
We just can't see it yet
'cause of all the trees.
Tom, we're going in circles.
We can't, Lucy. We're nearly there.
- How are we nearly there?
- We are.
We don't know where we're going.
LUCY: What are you doing?
I'll go ahead and check,
see if I can see it from outside.
Tom?
Tom?
Tom?
Whoa! It's me. It's me.
What?
- Come on.
- Did you pull my hair?
No.
Hurry up.
Scared?
TOM: Aw.
- We're not lost, by the way.
- Oh, really?
But if we were...
it's not either of our faults.
-
-
Tom...?
Tom?
Come on, get in. Hurry up.
Hurry up. Come on, come on. Get in.
-
- Fucking hell.
- Keys aren't in the car.
- What do you mean?
They're not in the car.
- They're not in your pocket?
- No, they're not in my pocket.
They have to be around here, then.
-
- They have to be here.
If you say you left them in the
car, then they have to be here.
- Fucking hell.
- Tom! God.
- Fuck, there they are.
- Were they there all the time?
No. I don't know.
TOM: Ahem.
I don't know why
I was so scared there.
You were scared there as well.
I see you were.
Huh?
You were quite...
At the time,
I thought someone like,
was gonna to be
sitting at the bush,
waiting for me or something,
jumping out.
I must have taken the keys
out of the car
when I jumped out or something,
or how could they have got there? I
swear they weren't in my pocket.
We're not lost.
We're in a fucking maze.
Was that there before?
- What?
- The sign on the door.
Who cares?
No. Lucy. Lucy.
Lucy.
Lucy.
- What is that?
- It's a map.
Of what? What does it say?
It's in case of a fire.
There's a track through the
forest back to the main road.
Right. Let's go.
Lucy.
Lucy?
TOM: Come on. It's nothing.
- Lucy?
- I'm coming. Wait.
I'm coming.
Which way, left?
Lucy, left?
Yes, it'll be on the left.
Just give me the map
for two seconds.
Um...
Yeah. Good.
So if we get reception
on the main road,
we should just phone them
and just say...
just say send someone down
to show us the way.
What are you talking about?
Well, if we can phone them, at least
maybe they can come pick us up.
Huh?
What? What's wrong?
Tom, I do not want to have to go
past that cabin again.
LUCY: This is it.
-
-
TOM: Shit.
- LUCY: Oh, fuck.
-
TOM: We can't go this way.
LUCY: Something's wrong!
Tom, slow down.
Tom, stop. Stop. Tom!
Give me the map.
LUCY: Just don't know what
the fuck is going on.
I mean, a 50-foot
fucking tree falling?
TOM: We're just getting ourselves
in a panic, and it's stupid.
LUCY: Just don't know
what the fuck's going on.
- LUCY: My God, we...
- What? It's just branches.
Well, have I got loads of...
have I got room on that side?
I don't know.
- Huh?
- No.
- What?
- Kind of.
Well, do I have room or not?
What? Lucy, look out that side.
- I'm... fuck!
- I'm just asking.
No, it's okay. I don't know.
It's fucking tiny, okay?
Well, all you've got to do
is look out the window.
I'm just asking you to help.
There's another sign.
"Kilairney House Hotel."
-
- What?
- Tom!
- What are you doing?
Tom, there's
someone standing there.
- Where? What?
- Back there.
- There is someone there.
- All right.
- What are you doing?
- Well, if there's someone standing...
- No! No, Tom!
- No, I'll go back.
- Tom, fucking stop!
- Look, if there's a guy there,
I'll ask him if we're
going the right way.
If there's not someone there,
you'll be happy.
Where? Where is he?
It's a scarecrow.
It's just your imagination
playing tricks.
- I really need to go for a piss.
- Now?
I'll be quick. I'm the
fastest pee-er in the world.
You're trying to prove a point.
I'm going to wet myself.
Be two shakes.
- What?
- Tom!
Turn the lights off!
Tom, there's someone
behind you!
What?
There's someone behind you!
Turn the lights off!
Tom!
Turn the fucking lights off!
Tom! Tom!
- What is wrong with you?
- Tom, there was someone there.
Can't I just take a quick piss?
What you doing?
- You didn't see them.
- What?
There's no one there!
Lucy, we've just had that moment
with the scarecrow.
My door slammed, and then there was
someone there when I
turned the lights on again.
Your door slammed?
What, so your door opened up?
No, your door slammed.
My door was closed.
Your door slammed.
Well, I didn't hear anything.
You're scaring me, honestly.
Tom, I'm scared.
He was wearing a white mask.
There was no face.
I couldn't see his face.
Or he had his face painted
or something. I don't know.
LUCY: Could it have been
one of those men we saw?
Why would you say that?
What happened in the pub?
I've told you.
TOM: What the...?
Ah, that's really weird.
They're mine.
- No, they're not.
- Yes, they are.
- It can't be your clothes.
- No, they're my clothes.
-
- LUCY: Wait, no. Tom, leave it.
Be two shakes.
- That's yours?
- Yes! It's all mine!
This doesn't make sense.
I mean, we've been
with the car the whole time.
- Why is this happening?
- I don't know, Lucy.
What do you mean?
Why are they doing this to us?
TOM: Why would I know?!
Whew.
Are you fucking with me?
Why would you say that?
- What are you doing?
- I'm stopping.
No point in going on.
I don't know where we're going.
There's no signs...
and the petrol's low.
May as well just sit here
until we can see something.
Ahem.
Right. Let's play a game.
You ready?
- What?
- Let's play a game, okay?
You have to answer straightaway.
Whatever I say, you have
to answer straightaway
or else it doesn't count, okay?
Okay.
Pink or blue?
Blue.
A sofa or a... or a seat?
- Sofa.
- Running or walking?
Walking.
- Bare feet, shoes?
- Bare feet.
Naked or clothed?
Naked. Clothed.
Ah, eh... you said, "naked" first.
I changed my mind.
A knife or a fork?
Come on. You have
to answer straightaway.
Okay...
gun or a knife?
I know something happened
in the pub.
Yep.
- Tell me.
- No, that's it.
Tell me. Tell me about the barman.
Maybe you did something to him.
Could be what you didn't do to him.
Could be what you didn't do to him.
- Fuck you.
- Where you going?
I'm cold. I'm getting a coat.
You okay?
No, not really.
You okay?
Yeah. I just don't know
where we're going.
You building a nest?
Yeah.
Stop! Hey!
-
- TOM: Stop! Hey! Hey!
Tom!
LUCY: Oh, God!
- Oh, God!
- Stop!
TOM: No!
- Get in! Go!
-
-
- Tom!
What the fuck is going on?
LUCY: What the fuck?
What the fuck is going on?
-
-
- Oh, did I...
- Tom, no.
TOM: He hit the car.
He hit the car.
He definitely hit the car.
He hit the side of the car.
- Hit the side of the car.
- Was he wearing a mask?
I can't see anything.
I can't see anyone.
No, I don't think
he was wearing a mask.
I don't think he was.
Lucy, I need to... I need to know
what has happened, 'cause I can't...
What if it's him? What if it's him?
What if we killed...
what if we killed someone?
What if we killed someone?
He wasn't wearing the mask.
What if he's running away?
What if...
I'll go. If you say it, I'll go.
Right now, I'll go.
Tell me. Tell me, and I'll
drive on if you say it.
Tell me. I will drive on.
-
- What?!
Please stop!
Hey! Hey! Hey, hey!
Hey, hey! Hey!
- Did you do this to me?
- No. Wait, wait, wait.
Did you do this to me?
- Did you do this to me?
- No, it's okay.
- What?
- Did you do this to me?
- He didn't do that to you.
- No, we were in the car.
Yeah, we were in the car.
We stopped.
I'm not talking about
when you knocked me over.
Talking about in that woods.
Did you drag me into that clearing,
and did you do this to me
with a knife?
- LUCY: No. We got attacked too.
- When? When?
Just before.
They're still out there, man.
They're out there now.
- We need to go now.
- Fuck. Tom, get in.
Hold on. Where...
how... where are you from?
- I'm from around here.
- LUCY: Get in the car.
I got attacked.
We need to get out of here now.
They're going to be looking for us.
We need to go now.
- We need to get out of here now.
- Okay, Tom. Tom. Tom!
- Please just get in the car.
- Do you want this to happen to you?
Do you want it to happen to her?
We need to go now.
- Tom. Tom, get in. Tom!
- I'm serious.
MAN: Can we go?
I don't care if you take me
a mile down the road, even less.
Just get me out of here.
Drive.
We can talk about this later.
Please, can we just
get out of here now?
We need to go now.
- Can we go now?
- Tom, please.
Can we go now, please?
Listen... thank you.
I know you hit me and everything,
but if you guys hadn't come
around that corner there...
Ah, Jesus.
- LUCY: You need a doctor.
- Ah, don't worry about me.
I'm sure the car
took the most of it.
Did you see who attacked you?
I'm not quite sure. I'll be honest.
Could be a group of guys.
They drink at the local pub.
They're not right in the head.
I mean...
I don't understand what's going on.
I'm Max, by the way.
I'm sorry, I didn't catch your names.
I'm Lucy.
- I'm Tom.
- MAX: Tom.
So are you... I forgot your name.
Linda? Lucy, is it?
Lucy.
Wanna do me a favor and just
tilt the mirror down there
just over here?
Just want to check something.
Just want to check my face.
Oh, Jesus. Is it bad? Is it bad?
TOM: No, it's not that bad.
Oh, that's even worse
than I thought it was.
That's a lot of blood.
We better get going.
There's a hotel not far from here.
- Yeah, Kilairney House Hotel.
- Kilairney House Hotel, yeah.
TOM: We just went past the sign.
MAX: We'll be able to get a
doctor from there or something.
Jesus, I...
I think I need to lie down.
Is that okay?
- TOM: What?
- Is it okay if I just lie down a bit?
TOM: Yeah. Yeah.
Do you know where we're
going, though, don't you?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just go straight.
If you follow the signs...
- TOM: Max.
- Yeah?
- There's a sign there.
- Yeah, just follow it.
So are you guys a couple, or...?
No.
Yeah, we're going to a festival.
Just stopping off.
- Where's the festival?
- Eh, not too far.
Why are you staying
in the hotel, then?
It's none of my business,
anyway. I'm sorry.
You been drinking, Tom?
No.
No wonder you didn't see me.
I'm not giving you a hard
time, Tom. I'm just...
TOM: Uh...
hey, whoa!
Hey, hey, hey!
Fucking sitting ducks here.
Go, go, go!
- Go back? Go back? Go back?
- No, go through.
- Go back?
- Go through it!
Tom, go through it!
- Go through. Don't stop.
- LUCY: No!
- Tom!
- Don't stop. Go through it.
I know who they are.
Butchers and hunters,
the lot of them.
-
-
MAX: Fuck's sake, Tom.
Just going to leave 'em there, Tom?
Fucking get rid of 'em.
I'll tell you who they are, and I
know exactly why they're after me.
- LUCY: Why?
- Ah, bad blood.
Been going on for years.
There's this one guy...
he'll be out there right now.
He's the ringleader.
When he was a kid...
took a notion to hide in the ditch
and wait for a car to come,
and just when it was approaching,
he stepped out in front of it
just to see what would happen.
Now, the driver hardly had time to brake.
I'm sure they tried.
But to avoid hitting the kid,
they swerved off the road...
crashed the car.
Driver was killed instantly.
Have we been here?
- Huh?
- Have we been here?
Why'd you bring us back here, Tom?
This is the last place
in the world I want to be.
You've told me you knew these roads.
Why are you blaming me?
There's no blame here, Tom.
I'm just trying
to figure out what happened.
I've been lying down here in
the back, bleeding to death
after you hit me with the car.
It's not why you're bleeding.
I mean, I'm not all
there right now.
I mean, my head's
been fucking cut open.
I got... you knocked me down.
I mean...
look, you don't
know the way, but I do.
Which way?
Go straight ahead, first right.
Yeah, right. Right, Tom.
Left. Go left.
Just keep going straight, Tom.
Left.
How the fuck did we come...?
They'll still be out there.
I thought they would have
given up by now and gone home.
They've changed the signs around.
Follow any of the signs, you'll come
back to exactly where you started.
You brought us here.
I followed your directions.
You did this.
What did you do to piss them off?
What?
You must have done something.
Something's happened.
Now, what happened?
- We haven't done anything.
- What happened?
We haven't done anything.
- Did you provoke them?
- No, we didn't provoke anyone.
Nah, something's happened.
What's happened?
Nothing fucking happened.
What about the pub?
- What happened in the pub? Did...
- Nothing happened in the pub.
Did you say something to them?
Nothing happened in the pub,
all right? Leave it.
- Well, clearly something did.
- No, nothing happened in the pub.
Lucy, what happened in the pub?
- Someone...
- Did you say something to them?
No, I didn't say anything to them.
Nothing happened in the pub.
So what? Now, clearly
something happened.
Tell him, Tom.
Why are we having... why are we
having this conversation? Huh?
- You said something, didn't you?
- Tom, please.
Lucy, tell me what happened.
Don't. Don't. Don't. Don't.
You provoked 'em, Tom.
Tom, what happened in the pub?
Nothing happened in the pub.
Then, why don't you want Lucy
to say anything?
When it's going to be something
that's really stupid
- that you're going to be saying!
- What? I'm not saying anything...
-
- MAX: Tom!
- Tom!
- Tom, where are you going?
Wow.
Really exploring his
maleness there.
Is he always like that?
- We only met two weeks ago.
- Oh.
Well, he did piss off
those men in the pub.
They took offense, which is why
they're doing all this, of course.
You were in the pub?
I didn't say it earlier, 'cause I
didn't want to alarm anybody...
but I saw Tom,
and Tom spilled this man's pint.
No.
No, no, no, no.
It was the other way around.
No.
Tom spilled a pint,
and he was refusing
to buy another one
until the man got real nasty
with your friend back there.
Tom's not like that.
He wouldn't...
he bought everyone a round.
We joked about it.
Yeah, I know it's confusing.
Christ, this pain is getting worse.
You wouldn't have any water
on you, would you?
Yeah, by your feet.
Lucy, could you...?
Thanks.
It's fine.
Couldn't open it for me, could you?
MAX: You feel better, Tom?
Do you want me to drive?
No.
I know where we are now.
I can get us out.
So let's go.
My... my head's
starting to bleed again.
Would you have
a handkerchief or something?
I don't want to bleed
all over your seats.
No, I haven't.
Oh, you wouldn't
check the glove box?
It's just that I don't want to
ruin all of your upholstery.
What's that, Lucy?
LUCY: It's a fire hazard warning.
Where'd you get that?
Tom threw it out the window.
Huh. That's strange.
LUCY:
Did you cut your own face, Max?
You took my clothes,
pulled my hair.
- I did it all.
- You dragged me out of the car.
I cut the tree.
I even wrote on the fucking wall.
It was always just me.
Drive as fast as you fucking can.
I've got a knife in the back
of her fucking head.
Drive as fast as you can, Tom!
Where are we going?
Where are we going?
I'll go straight through
the back of her fucking skull.
Faster, Tom.
-
- Faster, Tommy boy. Faster!
Lucy, go on, tell him.
Can you feel that, Lucy?
- I can feel it.
- There you go.
- Faster, Tom.
- I can't go any faster.
You can go faster.
You're not trying, Tom.
I will kill her. I am not joking.
- LUCY: Tom!
- MAX: Look at the road, Tom.
- I can't go any faster.
- Yes, you can. You can.
I can't go any faster,
or else I'll crash the car.
You make that choice.
Do you want to crash the car,
or do you want Lucy to die?
You can do it.
You can do it. Come on, Tommy.
- Come on, Tom.
- I can't go any faster.
Oh, you can go faster
than that, Tom.
You can go faster than that, Tom.
I can't go any faster!
- Faster!
-
I'll put this knife
right through her skull.
I'm going to put this knife
through her head.
- I can't go any faster!
- Going to put it through her head, Tom.
Faster! Faster!
Faster! Faster!
- MAX: Whoo!

- Shh, shh, shh, shh.

You had a choice back there,
Tommy boy.
I'm not wearing a seat belt.
You both are.
You probably could have killed
me and saved yourselves.
Now you've only
one more choice to make.
I want you to make it, Lucy.
I want you to choose
which one of you I kill.
No!
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
- 10...
- Fuck you!
It's just a name.
Nine...
Fuck you!
- Do it.
- No!
- Do it, Lucy.
- Eight.
- Seven.
- No!
Six.
- Go ahead.
- Five.
-
- Four.
No.
Don't move, Tom. Don't move.
Three.
- How much do you love Tom?
- Do it. Do it.
-
- Two.
How much do you love your life?
You or Tom?
One.
Tom! Tom!
Fuck's sake, lads,
I don't even have a knife.
Wow. Thanks.
Thank you.
What are you doing?
Okay, listen,
it's been interesting,
and thanks for the ride.
What are you doing, you fuck?
- See you later.
- Get out!
MAX:
It's not like I've done anything.
Get out of the fucking car!
Safe home.
Come on. Come on. Come on.
- Come on.
- You bastard!
Come on.
Come on!
-
- Get the fuck off me!
Come on. Come on.
That's it, boy.
- Tommy boy.
- You're fucked up.
That's it. That's it.
All right, Tom.
Come on, Tom.
Let's finish this.
-
- Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.
- Get off.
- Shh, shh, shh.
Ow, ow, ow.
- Shh, shh, shh.

LUCY: Tom?
Tom?
Tom?
-
- Tom.
- Tom!
-
Tom!
Ow, ow.
We're out of petrol.
I wanted...
I wanted to kill him, Lucy.
I said your name.
I said, "Tom."
Tom, get out of the car.
Tom! Tom!
I can't get...
- What are you...
- Tom.
TOM: Go. Move. Move. Run.
Lucy, Lucy, Lucy, wait.
TOM: Okay, turn... turn your light off.
Turn your light off. Shh.
- Tom.
- Do it.
Lucy, Lucy...
just keep going. Just keep going.
Go. Come on.
- Stop, Tom. Stop.
-
TOM: What's that?
Hey, wait, wait, wait.
TOM: Go. Go.
Tom?
Tom?
Tom? Tom?
MAX: Know what you're thinking!
"It looked a lot better
on the website!"
That took me ages!
You know how hard it was
to find a place like this?
Breakfast is served
half-6:00 to 10:00!
If you need a hand with your bags,
you're going to have to wait!
As you can see, I am snowed under!
Okay, I'll admit,
rooms are a little drafty!
See you in the morning, Luce.

Shit. Shit.
Come on, Lucy. Come on. Go faster.
What do you want from me?!
What do you want?!
Come on, Lucy.
Just finish your fucking game!
You fucking got me!
Whoo-hoo!
Tom? Tom!
Tom!
Tom!
Come on, Lucy.
Don't you fucking move, Max.
