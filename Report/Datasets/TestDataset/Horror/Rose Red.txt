Man: What the hell were
you thinking taking her that way?!
- The park is the other way!
- Girl: Annie wanted--
Man: What-- what does Annie want?
I mean, Annie can't talk,
- she can't think, she can't--
- Girl: She can think.
If you ever
looked at her you'd know.
Woman: Please. She's all right.
That's the main thing.
- Can't you just stop it?
- Man: Oh, you know this?
You know she's all right.
What if the damn dog was rabid?
Girl: It wasn't.
Mrs. Stanton told me.
Man: What? And you believe her?
Just like that?
That woman's an idiot,
a careless idiot.
Anyone can say anything, Sissy.
Maybe someday you'll learn that,
that anyone can say anything.
Sissy: I saw the dog tag, Daddy.
Why do you always
- treat me like a fool?
- Woman: Stop it! Both of you.
She'll hear.
Do you want to upset her?
Father: Oh come on, honey,
give me a break. You might as well...
Boy: Come on, guys!
Wait up!
I figured you could use
something stronger. I know I could.
Down the hatch, come on.
It's quick, isn't it?
What they do.
And it doesn't hurt them.
It's quick, it doesn't hurt,
they just go to sleep.
Come on, drink your drink.
Woman: You know
as well as I do
that Buddy never bit anybody
before in his life.
It was her.
He sensed something in her.
Sissy: Annie,
please open the door!
Father: Annie,
open this door, now!
Drink your drink.
It'll make you feel better.
I'm telling you, there's something
wrong with that little girl,
and I don't just mean
that she's autistic.
Sissy:
Please open the door!
Father: Annie, turn the music down!
Somebody'll call the damn cops!
Mrs. Stanton:
There's something about her
that's wrong.
And Buddy sensed it.
Dogs know, oh you bet.
Did you hear that?
Music.
Someone has it
really cranked out there.
- Oh!
- What the hell?!
It's an earthquake!
It's not coming
from the ground-- It's--
Ahh!
Aah!
Come on! Run!
- Mr. Stanton: Run!
- Ahh!!
Come on, come on!
- Sissy: Open the door.
- Father: Now, Annie!
Come on, hurry! Hurry!
- Oh God!
- What's happening?!
I don't know!
Father: Annie, let us in!
Annie!
Sissy: Annie, please,
open the door.
Kill it, Sissy.
Just what the hell
are you doing?
What the--
Sister, look at this.
Sister, I got Baby.
Yes, I know.
Annie...
what have you done?
Woman: And that concludes
this years' course-work
in the psychology of the unseen world.
I would like to leave you
with three thoughts if I may.
The first, is that the investigation
of psychic phenomena
is an honorable pursuit, in spite
of the field's tattered reputation.
The second, is that reality
is not always quantifiable.
Our inability to count, weigh,
sort or photograph some things,
does not mean that
those things are non-existent.
Third, and most important,
next week's exam will not
be graded on the curve.
Seriously, I thank you all
for your attention
and to remind you of what
someone rather famous once said,
"The truth is out there."
Enjoy your summer.
Student: Professor Reardon,
a question please.
A question.
Your question?
There are rumors
that you're planning
a scientific investigation
of Rose Red this summer,
the Rimbauer Mansion,
a sort of psychic field trip.
Is that true?
- You are...?
- Kevin Bollinger, Class of 'O3.
I don't recognize you,
Mr. Bollinger.
Is that because the group
is so large,
or could it be that this is your
first visit to our happy family?
Actually, I'm a reporter
for the campus newspaper.
Oh, my sympathies,
Mr. Bollinger.
Kevin: Is it true,
Professor Reardon, and if it is,
are you planning on using
departmental funds
or college general funds
to finance your latest spook hunt?
As any regular attendee
of these classes will tell you,
Mr. Bollinger,
I'm extremely interested
in Rose Red.
I talk about it all the time.
Have a picture on my office wall,
not to mention
one of Ellen Rimbauer.
But as Professor Miller can tell you,
I have filed no request
for either general funds
or money from the department
to underwrite
what you term "a spook hunt."
Reardon: If you feel like
asking him to confirm that, he's--
he's right up there.
Reardon: A question of mine,
Mr. Bollinger.
Did Professor Miller, perhaps,
suggest you stop by my class
to pose your question
instead of dropping by my office
like a normal reporter?
Reardon:
Never mind, Mr. Bollinger.
Let's consider
the issue closed, shall we?
- But you never answered my question.
- Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
Exam next Tuesday at 2:00
and I'll see you then.
If I embarrassed you,
Professor Reardon, I am sorry.
Hmm.
I don't believe it,
Mr. Bollinger.
Carl Miller stuck a key
in your back and wound you up.
And it was his intention
that I be embarrassed.
I am not.
Even if you're not planning
on using college
or departmental funds
for your Rose Red expedition,
won't you be using a lot of
psychology department equipment,
a lot of very
expensive equipment?
Haven't you already
entered into an agreement
with Steven Rimbauer,
the last remaining family member?
Good afternoon,
Mr. Bollinger.
- Girl: Hi, Professor Reardon.
- Hello.
Man: Well, Joyce.
- We have to discuss this.
- I think not.
Well, we'll have
to discuss it sooner or later.
You know, speaking for
the department, I think I can say
our patience with your shenanigans
has grown quite short.
Reardon: "...spooks.
Somebody call..."
Pfff.
Uh...
Oh...
Professor Reardon?
I was wondering
if you could discuss my--
Not now. My office hours are
clearly posted, can't you read?
Oh. Sorry.
Oh, um, uh, wait...
Ms. Spruce, isn't it?
Kathy Spruce, that's right.
I- I'm sorry, I didn't mean to bite.
Office hours are between
Yes, Ms. Reardon.
Out.
Out.
Oh...
Far out.
Hmm...
Waterman residence.
Mr. Waterman, Joyce Reardon.
Waterman:
Oh, hello, Ms. Reardon.
I've been meaning to call,
but I've been uh...
Reardon: Joyce, please.
I've been kinda busy.
Reardon: I understand, but I'm
finalizing my list of participants
for my little Rose Red field trip,
and I 'd really like you in.
- Have you thought about it?
- Rose Red is a dangerous place
to conduct psychic experiments,
Ms. Reardon--
Joyce.
As I'm sure you must be aware.
Reardon:
With all due respect, Emery,
Rose Red is a dead cell.
I'm sure it is,
if you're not psychic.
I'm sorry you feel that way.
I'll just let you get back
to what you were doing, shall I,
and move on to the next
name on my list?
I doubt
there are that many.
Not post-cognates
of my calibre.
You might be surprised.
Good afternoon.
Wait-- wait-- wait--
I didn't say no, did I?
Reardon: Didn't you?
No.
But 5,000 is a trifle low.
If you were to be offering
a bit more, say...
- Mr. Waterman,
- Emery, please.
last and only offer.
And a generous one considering
the fact that there have been
no phenomena in Rose Red
for five years or more.
Since they stopped the tours
and took away the fresh meat.
Isn't that what you mean?
Forgive me
but I find that ridiculous.
The funding for this expedition
is coming out of my own pocket.
And 5,000
is all I can afford.
So what do you say, Emery?
In or out?
All right, I'm in.
But I warn you,
if you want a videotaped
debriefing afterward, I get extra.
That's fine, Emery.
Memorial Day weekend.
Mark your calendar.
You send me a check,
Joyce, and I will.
Good day.
Putz.
Poisoned...
Guess not.
Whispering voice: Emery...
Hey, whoever you are,
save the warnings
for someone who's not broke.
Okay?
Woman: Emery?
Emery!
Emery!
Here you are.
There are some more bags
out in the car.
They're going
out of business at Griffin's.
Everything's 25%off.
That's too much cream,
you'll make yourself fat.
Er.
- I beg your pardon?
- Fat-er.
I'm already fat.
Cream clogs up
your arteries, Emer.
A little's okay
but that's too much.
Get my things out of the car.
I tell you, I made a killing.
Mom, I was doing
the bills just now.
Well,
what about the bills?
A lot of them are past due.
It's the credit cards, Mom--
I'm very careful
with the credit cards.
I'm a very wise shopper.
I'll get your stuff.
Isn't this
just the best bear?
I'm gonna put him on the end
of my bed with Hester and Fester.
What rhymes
with Hester and Fester, Emmy?
Pester.
The woman from the college
who wants to investigate
Rose Red called again.
See? Something always turns up.
God provides, I've always said so.
Rose Red's
supposed to be dangerous.
If you take the usual precautions
you'll be fine.
And we'll pray, of course.
Were you able to get her up to 75?
No. She's financing
the expedition herself.
Or so she told you
and you believed her, of course.
You want to call her back?
I have the number.
No. A deal's a deal.
One of the few sensible things
your father ever said.
Did you tell her it would be
extra for interviews after?
- Physicals? EKG's?
- Yes.
And no X-rays.
They give you cancer.
Now run along and get my bags.
Then you can have your pie.
Office hours are over.
Come back tomorrow.
- I said office hou--
- Extra credit, Ms. Reardon.
I'll do anything,
look good in a bathing suit,
look great in one of those
French maid's outfits.
Come in, you idiot,
and close the door.
All right.
Teach, you're looking good today.
- Ooh...
- Mmm.
The idiot wants to know
how you're doing.
Well, I won't lie to you,
it's been a tough day.
But I have a very
important call to make.
- Oh...
- So...
What, this is the Wheaton girl?
The one you really want?
Her sister. If you can sit there
and keep quiet you can stay.
But if you feel an attack
of monkeyshines coming on,
then go. Get out now.
That's pretty
tough talk considering
it's my old family's homestead
you want to go exploring in.
But...
I'll be good, Dee, I swear.
I won't do that, sorry.
Hello? Ms. Reardon?
Yes, how are you?
Sissy: I'm all right.
But you know how hard it is
to keep people away
from a phone in this place?
Also I'm on my break,
so let's make this fast.
Reardon: Uh--
I could call you later.
Sissy: No, I don't think so.
I still live at home
to be near Annie and...
my father knows who you are
and what you want.
He doesn't approve.
What are you saying?
Annie won't take part?
Sissy: I'm saying that
if I bring Annie to Rose Red...
the chances are good that
I could never go home again.
That'd be all right with me but,
Annie shouldn't be there without
someone who understands her.
Mm-hmm. And--
and your parents don't?
Sissy: Well...
my mother's
scared to death of her and,
my father...
I think my father hates her.
What can I do?
There's a school just outside
of Tacoma for people like Annie.
No, there's no one
like Annie I don't think...
but...
it's a place for autistic teenagers.
A good place.
I might as well cut right
to the chase, Ms. Reardon,
If you can promise 10
I might try to make this happen.
the check to you myself.
This afternoon.
Where-- where do you work?
No, you need to slow down.
I need to think about this.
Reardon: Look, my time is short,
Ms. Wheaton.
Please, call me Sister,
why don't you? Everyone does.
Mr. Rimbauer has agreed to open
Rose Red for my group
over the Memorial Day weekend.
It's only nine days away.
I need to know if
I can count on Annie.
In fact I'm having an orientation
meeting this Monday night,
for the participants here
in Wimser Hall at the University.
It would be great
if Annie could join us.
You understand that if Annie goes
to Rose Red I go too, don't you?
Reardon: That--
that's fine, of course.
When can I know,
Ms. Wheaton? Uh, Sister.
I-- I might be able
to scrape up as much as $12,000
if uh, that is,
if you can make a solid commitment
to the expedition right now.
I can't do that.
- Goodbye, Mrs. Reardon.
- Reardon: Wait!
When can I expect
to hear from you?
- I'll be in touch.
- Wait! The-- the--
orientation Monday night?
I don't know... it...
I don't think so.
Ohh.
$10,000?
$12,000? You know, I'm-- I'm
starting to think that I sold
the old homestead cheap.
You didn't sell it, you're renting it.
For a single weekend.
I've gotta have Annie Wheaton.
Why?
I've got the makings of a good
group here, but they're candles.
Annie Wheaton
is a searchlight.
If anyone can wake up Rose Red,
she is the one.
I told you before, Dee,
waking up Rose Red
isn't a good idea.
I want Annie.
I want Annie Wheaton.
Hello, dear.
Hey, Mom. Hi, Dad.
Mrs. Wheaton:
Long day? You look tired.
I'll microwave you
a TV dinner.
It's okay. I had something
to eat at the restaurant.
Is Annie okay?
- Annie is fine.
- Yeah, wearing out her ears again.
Not to mention ours.
If it isn't "A Summer Place"
it's that other crap.
"Pennsylvania 69,000"
and "In The Mood."
Same two, over and over
all afternoon.
- I guess she just likes it.
- Mr. Wheaton: Yeah, I know that.
I just can't
figure out why.
Thank God for small favors.
Annie...
Annie... come...
Reardon: Despite what
some people may think,
psychic powers--
telepathy,
telekinesis, precognition,
all the rest,
have no moral gradient.
They are neither good
nor bad.
Houses are different.
Shirley Jackson was right.
Some houses are born bad.
Houses like this one.
Houses like Rose Red.
I knew it was big,
but that's enormous.
Reardon: Fortunately for us,
an enormous dead cell.
There have been no overt
manifestations in Rose Red
since 1995 or so.
I believe that some houses
have their own inner life
that may or may not
be conscious.
If there was once consciousness
in Rose Red,
it manifested itself early.
The Seattle of 100 years ago
was a different world,
more different than
any of us can imagine.
Survival was an actual issue,
not a TV show.
Fortunes were made,
often by bandits in tall hats.
You could get out of the way
or get run down.
Those were the options.
In the year 1906,
you were on your own.
Rose Red...
was built by John P. Rimbauer
at the top of Spring Street
in the center of Seattle,
as a wedding present
to his wife.
Rimbauer was founder
of Omicron Oil Company, until 1950
the biggest oil company
in America.
Ellen Rimbauer disappeared.
The trouble with Rose Red
started even before
there was a house.
Construction crews worked
seven days a week.
But that wasn't the problem.
The problem was that even before
there was a house there,
that piece of ground
made people mad.
Literally mad.
The Teamster made no effort
to get away,
just dropped the gun in his wagon
and went down to a Seattle saloon,
which was where
the police found him.
The Teamster's name
was Harry Corbin.
When he was tried,
he claimed
he remembered nothing
from breakfast
till the time he woke up in jail
with a knot behind his ear.
The judge didn't believe him,
neither did the jury.
He got 25 years.
I think Harry Corbin
may have been Rose Red's
first victim.
First male victim.
There has always been a difference
between the way Rose Red
treats the ladies
and the gentlemen.
- What do you mean, exactly?
- In time, Nick.
All in good time.
John Rimbauer
and Ellen Gilchrist
were married
on November 12, 1907.
He was 40 and she...
was 20.
By the day they said
their I do's,
Rose Red had been
under construction for a year.
Already there had been
three deaths,
in addition to the murder
of Rimbauer's first foreman.
Pick it up!
Reardon: One man
was decapitated
by a sheet
of falling glass.
Another fell from a scaffold
and broke his neck.
And the third...
choked to death
on a piece of apple.
This is the way
Rose Red looked
when it was completed
in 1909.
In case your memory
needs refreshing,
this is the way
it looks today.
It's as if it metastasized.
Rose Red has how many rooms?
- No one really knows.
- Man: On Monday you can count
and come up with 87 or 97.
That's impossible,
isn't it?
That's Rose Red, sweetheart.
Nick: How many people
have disappeared?
There must be
an accurate account of them.
of the first World War.
Emery:
You'll forgive me if I say
I find that impossible
to believe.
Reardon: Of course you do.
Anyone would.
But I assure you it's true.
Five men and 18 women.
Rose Red has always been
particularly fond of the ladies.
Remember we're speaking
of a house
- which has fallen dormant.
- Woman: It better be,
because $5,000 isn't enough
if it isn't.
- When was the last disappearance?
- Reardon: 1972,
almost 30 years ago.
As I said before,
there have been no
observable phenomena since--
- Who was the last one?
- Reardon: Pam...
We've got a lot to cover,
we don't need to focus on--
A woman on the Historical Society's
annual tour.
She was with the group
when they went upstairs.
It wasn't until
the tour was over
that they realized
she wasn't with them anymore.
Officer: What's that?
Man: They didn't find her,
but they found her purse.
Reardon: Finished?
Yeah.
Thank you.
The lady's name
was Liza Albert.
Since her disappearance,
the house has been closed to tours.
With no psychic energy
for the house to feed on,
it seems to have fallen
into a sleep, then a coma.
- And now...
- It's a dead cell.
Reardon: Exactly.
I wouldn't bet on that
if I were you.
Reardon: Rose Red wasn't finished
when John and Ellen got married,
but they weren't in a hurry
to set up housekeeping.
They passed the time with
an enormous, leisurely honeymoon.
They were gone a year.
They circled the globe
on liners like this one...
The Ocean Star.
John Rimbauer's favorite part
of the tour was Africa.
Ellen didn't enjoy it
quite as much.
In fact,
she nearly died.
- Was it malaria?
- Reardon: Probably not.
In her diary she called it
"an unmentionable disease
carried by men
and suffered by women."
Doesn't exactly look prostrate
with worry, does he?
With or without him,
Ellen recovered.
When she and John finally
took up residence in Rose Red,
she was pregnant.
January, 1909,
that would have been.
John thought
the house was finished.
They're here!
How beautiful you are,
Rose Red.
Reardon: He didn't know
that the house would never be done.
Not in his lifetime,
not in hers.
What makes Rose Red
one of the world's most
fascinating psychic artifacts...
is that the house
continued to grow
until its death
in 1995 or 1996.
Until 1950 changes
and additions were made
according to the will
of Ellen Rimbauer,
and her will,
ladies and gentlemen, was iron.
After 1950...
after 1950...
Rose Red grew on its own.
Reardon:
In the fall of 1909,
Ellen Rimbauer
gave birth to a son.
Grampy.
- Your grandfather, really.
- Yeah.
I'm afraid so.
In her diary she wrote,
"I have called him Adam,
for he is the first."
Sukeena, the woman who came back
from Africa with her,
saw her through
the difficult labor.
In her diary, Ellen never refers
to Sukeena as her servant.
First she calls her,
"my friend."
Later, "my sister."
When Ellen gave birth
to a daughter with a withered arm,
she blamed
her African sickness
and her husband's
sexual appetites,
although she wrote,
"In my mind they are one,"
to which she added,
"Damn all men."
John and Ellen's daughter
was born in April of 1911 .
And April was what
they called her.
In the years following
the birth of Ellen's daughter,
Ellen became convinced
that her fever,
which recurred periodically,
would kill her young.
That made her easy game
for Madame Stravinsky,
as she called herself.
If you have anything
to say to us,
you may use my body...
to speak.
Stravinsky: Give us a sign.
Show us a sign.
Reardon: Not even Sukeena
could convince her
that the old lady was a fraud.
Stravinsky: Beloved spirits,
we invite you
to commune with us.
Show us a sign.
Reardon: Fraud or not,
Madame Stravinsky,
known to police in San Francisco
and Los Angeles
as Cora Fry,
changed
Ellen Rimbauer's life
one night
in August of 1914.
Sukeena!
- You must build.
- What did she tell her?
Rimbauer: That Great-Gram wouldn't
die until the house was finished.
Great-Gram told her it was finished,
and Madame S. told her,
"It isn't finished
until you say it's finished."
"Until you say."
Ellen took it seriously,
probably she was right to.
Everything else aside,
she never had another attack
of her African fever.
- It was probably psychosomatic.
- Just PMS, right, Em?
I wouldn't be at all surprised.
A new wing, the first of many,
started going up the next week.
What did her husband
say about that?
Rimbauer: Nothing,
she gave him a son in 1909,
a daughter in 1911 .
She had a withered arm,
but the son was fine.
It was the son John Rimbauer
cared about. In his mind Ellen
had fulfilled her function,
and could do what she liked.
Would you agree?
Yes. Besides...
he had affairs of his own
to tend to.
Ellen continued to make
additions to the house
until her disappearance
in 1950.
Over 40 years
of well-financed eccentricity.
When she ran out of
conventional things to build,
she hired contractors
and architects to build
- unconventional stuff.
- Such as...?
Reardon: The so-called
tower folly
was completed in 1921 .
John Rimbauer jumped to his death
from it two years later.
Was it suicide...
or did he run into something
he couldn't deal with?
The certificate said
accidental death.
The gossip said
suicide or ghosts.
In any case,
during its active years,
and they were very active,
women in Rose Red
tended to turn up missing,
and men tended
to turn up dead.
- The bad days are over.
- Reardon: Yes.
Indeed.
Are you sure?
Positive.
Then what do you want
from us, Ms. Reardon?
First off, let's all get on
a first-name basis, shall we?
That will make things
less difficult.
This can be...
a difficult field.
People either don't understand
our goals,
or refuse to credit
our findings.
Some people
are actively cruel.
And...
Research goals?
Yes, yes.
My research goals...
specify measurable
psychic phenomena.
Hard data in other words.
Telemetry readouts...
and anomalous energy levels,
primarily.
I want readouts
that even the most...
stupid, sarcastic,
obtuse member
of this so-called scientific
department will have to accept.
If I get a little crazy
on the subject
from time to time,
please forgive me.
I've put in a lot
of long days.
If Rose Red is a dead cell,
how much proof can you expect
to find there?
Reardon:
If you apply electricity
to the muscles in the leg
of a dead frog,
the muscles will contract
hours after the frog has died.
You people are my psychic
equivalent of electricity.
My goal is modest...
a single twitch.
One single twitch.
If I get it...
my reputation will be secure
for the rest of my life.
More importantly,
together we can legitimize
a branch of psychology
which has been treated as
a poor relation for far too long.
What are you doing here,
Mr. Rimbauer?
What are your special talents?
Just protecting the family interests.
I promised the professor
one good shot at the mansion
and then the developers await.
Tech-Star Condominiums,
the future.
You're gonna let them tear it down?
It's a piece of history.
History don't pay no rent
and the kid is broke.
Hardly the most noble
of motives.
Are we the team?
The whole team?
- She hopes not.
- Beg your pardon?
I was hoping for one more,
but that's looking iffy.
If I have to make do
with you five,
then I'll count myself lucky.
I'll see you this Friday
at 2:00 p.m. sharp.
I'm sure it will be
a Memorial Day weekend to remember.
If you could
all please join me...
I'd like to close
with a circle.
This sort of thing went out
with high-buttoned shoes.
Joyce, is there anything
you'd like us to focus on?
Good will, good thoughts,
each other.
- That's lovely.
- Thanks.
Say cheese.
Vic, are you okay?
Fine.
I'm gonna go make some room.
He looks a bit gray
about the gills.
No, no.
Maybe half a glass,
but no more.
Man:
Just a minute, please.
TV: The Huskies were caught
off guard by the weak-side blitz.
The linebacker starts to drop back,
and then rushes the quarterback.
Y-ello.
Hello. I'd like to speak
with Rachel. Is she there?
- Who is this?
- I'd like to speak with Rachel.
I know who this is.
The crazy lady from the college.
- How you doin', crazy lady?
- Is that for me?
Reardon: My business is with
your older daughter.
- I'd be grateful--
- You've got it wrong.
You have no business here.
Not with Sissy, Annie,
or any of us.
Don't ever call here again,
got that?
Daddy...
- that was my call.
- That was some crazy lady.
- That was my call. You have no right--
- Yeah, I do,
as long as you live in my house
and eat my food.
Stop it, both of you.
I know what
the crazy lady wants.
Just like I know you've been
talking to her behind my back.
Let me tell you this,
Annie's not going near Rose Red.
- Mama?
- She doesn't say. I say.
Mama?
Won't you help me once?
Please, just this once,
will you speak up?
I've told you 1000 times,
I won't take sides
between you and your father.
Sister: Mama.
What about Annie's side?
- The Gatt School--
- What planet are you living on?
You'll put her
in the Gatt School with $5,000?
- Professor Reardon has promised 12!
- I knew she was crazy.
What's your excuse?
$20,000 is what it would take.
- $20,000 at least. A year.
- Rose Red is famous.
If something happens while we're there,
it'd be worth a fortune to Annie.
Sure. I can just
see her on Geraldo.
"Hi, I'm Annie Wheaton.
I'm gonna tell folks
all about a haunted house."
- Sister: Stop it! Don't mock her!
- I'm saving her.
From crazy lady number one,
and crazy lady number two!
That is it, Sister.
This case is closed.
I won't hear any more about it.
- Sister: I'm calling her. We're going.
- No, you're not.
- Stop it, Annie! Stop it!
-
Make her stop!
What do you think, Dad?
What do you think
Annie wants?
- Stop it, Annie!
-
George!
Make her stop!
For God's sake!
Please, George,
make her stop!
Nick:
We thought you were lost.
No, just misplaced.
- May I propose a toast?
- Pam: Sure.
To Rose Red.
All: To Rose red.
Vic: Joyce...
she's looking,
still hoping for one more.
A sixth.
Six is the number.
Nick:
A girl. A teenager.
And I think our dear professor
will be in luck.
Is that something you see?
What's your special trait,
Pam?
I'm what psychic journals
call a touch-know.
It doesn't always work,
but sometimes
when I handle things,
I see stuff,
or I get feelings.
Of course,
a lot of times
there's nothing.
What about you, Vic?
Two people...
mid-20s.
She's in a blue dress.
Vic:
He's in jeans.
He's blonde
over-golded.
He's got a case of Roman hands
and Russian fingers.
What in the world
are you talking--
Man:
...Go outside.
- You wanna?
- Woman: Sure.
Trés chic, n'est-ce pas?
- You're precognitive!
- I can tell a hawk from a handsaw
when the wind's
in the northwest.
What about you, Cathy?
I'm an automatic writer.
- A Ouija board.
- Cathy: Yes.
But I don't like
the Ouija board.
The channel's too wide,
and sometimes what comes through
is unpleasant.
This is better.
Sometimes it's precog,
sometimes it's astral.
Mostly it's just
people to people.
Someone concentrate hard.
You, Pam.
Oh. Okay.
Let's see.
Uh...
Okay.
I guess
it's not going to work.
Steve?!
What about you, Ste--
Nick?
He calls her Dee.
Why does he do that,
I wonder?
Nick?
I do a little of this,
a little of that.
Sometimes I get lucky
and things turn out all right.
What about
our new friend, Emery?
What do we know about him?
- Your friend, not mine.
- Cathy: I think Emery is
post-cognitive.
He sees the past.
Not the most comfortable
of talents.
Here's to good thoughts.
Goodwill.
Nick:
Good thoughts, goodwill.
Who are you?
Why are you here?
Where are you from?
When are you from?
Is it Rose Red?
Read my lips.
Save the warnings
for someone who's not broke.
Okay?
I remember that day.
She was happy,
wasn't she?
- We all were.
- Oh, man...
- Would you look at this?
- Huh?
Mr. Wheaton:
Those were the days, huh?
Ignorance is bliss.
Daddy,
what Annie is,
isn't anyone's fault.
It's not hers, it's not mine,
it's not yours.
I know that.
But you're too busy thinking
about what you want for Annie
to think about
what she can do.
Have you forgotten
what happened
after she got bit
by the Stantons' dog?
How the stones came down?
Or what she did
to those pipes?
After what
she did tonight...
how can you have any doubts
about what she wants?
Sweetheart,
taking Annie into
a genuinely haunted house?
That's like using a lighter
to see how full your gas tank is.
It's a chance.
That's what you don't understand.
It's a chance
for her to get out--
And for you
to get out from under.
I just want
what's best for Annie.
I know, Sissy, but you don't know
what that is.
Believe me.
Whispering voices:
Annie...
come...
Come...
Pity you can't do the same
with the other 40,000 or so.
People read it today and line their
kitty litter boxes with it tomorrow.
I think they'll remember
the photo.
Some will take that
for inspection the next time
the university bond issue
comes up before the voters.
A photo like this could put
But what do you care?
Do you have a point, Carl?
If so, get to it.
- I have a lot to do.
- Crystals to polish?
Ouijas to wax?
Did you put that kid Bollinger
up to this? You did, didn't you?
You told him where to go
and when to point his camera.
Tsk-tsk-tsk...
Your paranoia's showing.
Reardon: Ah!
It's a nasty little cut.
Well, listen...
I'm afraid I have bad news
for you, old girl.
I'm not old.
Not yet anyway.
And I'm certainly
not your girl.
- What are you talking about?
- The Executive Committee
has been in session
regarding tenure.
What? Why? No one in
the department's up for tenure.
The only thing that--
You really are a bastard.
The Committee voted five to two
to revoke your tenure.
We tried to contact you
so you could attend.
You'll find a message
on your machine.
I'm surprised the spirits
didn't tell you.
The general consensus is
it's time to stop the silliness.
I will fight you
every step of the process.
Of course,
and you'll lose.
Your days of haunting
the Wimser Psychology department--
to coin a phrase--
are not quite over,
but they're numbered.
When I come back from Rose Red
with proof, you--
This is the rallying cry of crackpots
and deluded religionists.
Since the Stone Age,
the proof is out there.
This is sad, really.
You used to be a respected writer
and lecturer in child psychology.
But then you got bitten
by this... virus!
It is a legitimate field
of psychological investigation.
It's crap! It's sleazy!
It's a spit in the eye
of rational thought!
But the good news is,
that Rose Red
will be your last goose chase
as a member of this faculty.
You're an idiot and you're blind!
What if you find proof?
Let's just suppose.
Proof, photographs,
audio recordings
of the clanking chains,
telemetry of some sort.
What good would it do?
Have you considered such thoughts?
I feel remarkably well today,
in spite of
all your crap.
This is the world
we live in
and experience
with our five senses.
Skin...
smooth and rational.
Reardon:
Every cause has its effect,
and every effect can be predicted
with the right database.
But there's a world
under that world,
blood,
under the skin.
That's what rationalistic asses
like you never see.
It's a world that's liquid
instead of solid,
hot instead of just warm.
It is a world
full of mystery, Carl.
You don't like it,
do you? No.
So don't give me your bull about
bond issues and busted programs.
You're afraid
of what's under the skin.
But I'm not.
Do you hear me, Carl?
I'm not.
- If you've given me something--
- That's what it comes down to, huh?
The bottom line?
You're afraid of catching something.
Go on, get out of here.
Go wash your face,
then you can trot to the infirmary
and get an AIDS test.
When the semester's over,
you're done here.
You're finished teaching.
You're crazy!
- You're totally insane!
- Good day, old boy.
- What are you looking at?!
- Nothing.
Then go look
somewhere else!
We did it, didn't we?
We nailed her.
What's on your face?
Never mind.
Never mind.
We have a great deal
to talk about, young man.
The story's not over?
It's just beginning.
It's just beginning.
Steve: From the Department
of Questions Better Not Answered,
if a tree falls in the forest,
and no one hears it,
- does it make any noise?
- Mm-hmm.
Who cuts
the barber's hair?
Who leaves money under
the Tooth Fairy's pillow?
How come no one realizes
Clark Kent is just
Superman wearing glasses?
- Mm-hmm.
- If I didn't own Rose Red,
would I be in bed
with you right now?
Mm-hmm.
Hello.
- How was your day, dear?
- Give it back.
How was your day?
Or would you prefer that
I just rolled over
and made myself small?
They revoked my tenure.
Carl Miller dropped by the office
to give me the news himself.
- Wait. Can they do that?
- Maybe. Probably.
Bollinger's article
in the paper made us look
like the Stupid Family,
with me as the Head Stupid.
You want
to turn off your light?
You're pretty damn
calm about it.
I heard from Sister.
She accepted
the $12,000 I offered.
When I come back from Rose Red
with hard data,
there'll be four dozen universities
willing to hire me.
First,
I'm going to write a book.
It is going to sell
a gazillion copies.
I once heard you say
that the only certainty
when dealing with the paranormal
is that nothing is certain.
What if you spend three days
in Rose Red and nothing happens?
But it will.
Annie Wheaton
is my guarantee.
She's--
Let's just say
she's one of a kind.
You know, Rose Red
is not a true dead cell.
Annie's going
to wake it up.
And if you would just let the house
stand for another six months,
- the research possibilities--
- No. No.
It's coming down in July,
and I can't wait.
I cannot wait.
How can you hate it
so much?
It eats my relatives!
- I'm sorry.
- Did you miss that in your research?
It's just that
it means a lot to me.
Yeah, too much maybe.
You'll need some down time
when this is over.
Some serious R&R.
Well, you have
the cell phone.
Right here.
- And you've got plenty of film.
- Of course,
but I don't know if
this is such a good idea.
Don't tell me
you're afraid.
No, of course
I'm not afraid.
It's just big.
What if I get lost?
Kevin, you know,
you're about to step out
in the real world
in a couple of weeks.
That's where you're apt
to get lost.
But you nail this story,
you can write your own ticket.
I thought that's
what you wanted.
Why don't you come
in there with me?
I do have
a few things to do,
like running my department,
overseeing finals...
Call me when you
get the pictures,
either I or my wife
will come get you.
She can't stand
that Reardon bitch either.
If they catch me in there,
they'll tear me apart.
There's no reason
why they should.
If you're reasonably careful.
I guess.
Whoa-whoa-whoa!
Don't forget this.
And try and get a good picture
of them being psychic.
- Professor Miller, I don't think--
- Stiff upper, boy!
Stiff upper!
Professor Miller...
You're a step away
from stardom, dear boy!
Just get the pictures!
Solarium...
kitchen...
tool-shed...
back door...
front door...
Kevin: Oh.
- I thought this house was empty.
- It would be,
Mr. Bollinger, I believe.
- The reporter.
- Yeah, I'm Bollinger.
- But how did you know?
- Come in, sir.
You're expected.
Ma'am?
Where are you?
Sukeena:
This way, sir.
Kevin: Hello?
Hello?
Ma'am,
I seem to have lost you.
Ma'am?
Is anybody here?
Ma'am?
Screw this.
Okay, very funny,
but I want to leave, all right?
Let me out!
I could use
a little help in here!
- I'm in the greenhouse!
-
Let me out!
Let me out of here!
Let me out!
I'm out of here.
Come on.
Get a grip, Bollinger.
Miller over phone:
Hello?
Hello?
Who is this?
Bollinger?
Bollinger, is that you?
Hello?
Steve: Hey.
They'll be here.
Come on.
Wait!
Don't make me chase you,
Emmy!
- Mom, I'm okay.
- Yes, you're always okay?
Now, listen to me.
If anything happens
that you can't handle,
anything beyond a few
telesmic manifestations,
- call me and I'll come and get you.
- I will, Mom. I have to go.
You call me anyway
so I know you're all right.
I always do.
I have to go.
- Emery: They're waiting.
- Let them wait.
They won't do much
without you, huh?
Now, turn around.
- Mom...
- Turn around.
And stay away
from that blonde girl.
She looks like a tramp.
Now give Mommy a kiss.
You're all over lipstick.
Fix yourself.
Nick: Friends, I see new frontiers
in abnormal psychology
stretching out before us.
How exciting!
Mrs. Waterman:
...Especially if you move your bowels!
Gosh, the day before summer camp
must have been a busy time
- in the Waterman household.
- Shut up!
Off to the house
on haunted hill, I see?
Oh and with--
with about $100,000 worth
of department equipment.
I've got all
the proper paperwork
if you want to see it signed
in all the proper places.
Oooh...
signed by Rogers.
When I was on vacation,
he was acting in my stead.
Very clever of you.
- Is there a point to any of this?
- Just trying to be pleasant.
If you'll excuse us,
Professor Miller, we're in a hurry.
Yes, of course.
Places to go,
ghosts to bust.
Isn't that right, Mr. Rimbauer?
Yeah, more or less.
Yes.
Well, keep the equipment
in one piece.
Good luck.
The spirits have done it
all in one night.
That's what Scrooge says
when he wakes up a changed man.
That's what he made me think of.
Scrooge on Christmas morning.
I don't trust him.
Hello.
Are you the group?
Pam:
The Rose Red group?
Yes.
I'm Pam Asbury.
This is Cathy Kramer.
Hi.
- Victor Kandinsky.
- Vic. Just Vic.
Oh.
Pam:
Nick Hardaway.
Pam:
And Emery Waterman.
And...
- you must be...
- I'm Sissy Wheaton. This is Annie.
I was sure we were going to miss
you guys. Traffic was horrible.
- We're glad you didn't.
- Sister--
- or do you prefer Rachel?
- Either is fine.
Just quit it.
Emery:
Good God. She's retarded.
If you keep
your psychological evaluation
of Miss Wheaton to yourself,
we won't ask you
any embarrassing questions
about your relationship
with your mother. Chin, chin.
Reardon: Folks,
I think we're ready.
Recording: You've reached
the cell phone of Carl Miller.
Please, leave a message
after the tone.
Bollinger, where are you?
I told you to keep
that phone with you...
In any case,
they've left the campus.
They'll be there
in 40 minutes,
so be ready.
Then call me back.
There she is.
It seems
to be looking at us.
It is, Cathy.
It is.
Steve.
Boy: Mommy?
Where are you?
Mommy?
I'm scared.
Where are you, Mommy?
Nick: Steve.
Steve, you okay?
Huh?
Yeah, sure. Fine.
You wanna know a secret?
I've never done anything
like this before
and I'm pretty much
scared to death.
Be not afraid.
Only believe.
We're lucky most
of the electronic stuff
was delivered and installed
earlier this week.
- What are these?
- House plans.
Probably as useful as
a 14th century map of Africa.
And here,
a coil of rope.
How are you doing, sweetie?
Are you okay?
Boy's voice:
Mommy? I'm scared.
Stevey...
Stevey... come...
Nick:
What is it? What can you hear?
- Steve...
- It knows we're here.
Steve:
It wants us here.
God help us.
It wants us here.
Come in...
Come see...
