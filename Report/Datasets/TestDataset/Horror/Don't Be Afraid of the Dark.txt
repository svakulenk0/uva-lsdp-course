Mr. Blackwood?
Sir?
Mr...
Mr. Blackwood, I'm sorry.
You did ring, sir?
: Come down.
I wandered today
to the hill, Maggie
The creek and the creaking
old mill, Maggie
I'm so...
So very sorry.
I didn't see the steps.
They made me do it.
I didn't...
If I want to see
my child again,
I must comply.
Mr. Blackwood.
Please understand.
Are gone, Maggie
When you and I...
: Precious teeth.
Beautiful teeth.
Ransom for my boy.
Yes.
They say I'm feeble
with age, Maggie
: Daddy.
My face is
a well written page, Maggie
I... brought you something
more to eat.
Not children's teeth
like you wanted,
but please accept them...
in exchange for him.
CREATURES: Children's teeth.
Oh, no,
that's the best I could do.
And they're my own.
You see?
My own.
Please.
Give me back my son!
CREATURES: Yes, your son is down here.
Reach for him.
Son? Son!
Son!
Grab my hand!
: We've now begun
our descent into T. F. Green Airport.
Please return to your seat,
make sure it is in...
She's landed.
What do you think?
Too much?
No, it's perfect.
Just like you.
There's my girl.
Sally?
Wow! Look
how tall you are!
What are you,
Dad, you know
how old I am.
I know.
I'm being silly.
Hey.
Good morning, sir.
Thank you.
: Come on.
Sally, this is Kim.
Kim, Sally.
Hi, Sally.
It's nice to meet you.
: I love you.
I love you.
Thanks.
What about a picture?
You got your camera?
It's good
to see you.
: Good morning,
Rhode Island!
- : Everything okay?
- : Yeah.
We've got fog this morning and a
slight chance of a shower later on.
Smell that fresh air,
kiddo?
- Sure beats the smog of LA, huh?
-
I have to call
Mom now.
Just press one
and the green.
Hi, you've called Joanne and
the magical Sally! Leave us a message.
L.C. delivered
the flooring.
If it rains,
I'm afraid it's gonna warp.
Well, just put it
in the garage.
Sally, say hello
to Mr. Harris.
Nice to meet you.
: Come,
take a look at the house.
: Mr. Harris. Mr. Harris,
would you give me a hand...
- : How's it going?
- Good.
- When do you think you'll be finished?
- No problem.
Good, huh?
- It smells funny.
- You should've smelled it before.
They had moldy
newspapers everywhere,
and dead pigeons all over
the floor and poop.
Lots of it.
It's Jacoby's office.
Mr. Jacoby.
Oh, hey, Michelle.
Sorry.
Uh, I don't know.
Hold on. I'll check.
You got the photographs?
I like to draw, too.
You work here?
No, Sally,
I live here.
I'm the interior designer.
Do you know what that is?
Of course you do.
You see all the animal
paintings and friezes?
They're by Emerson Blackwood,
a man who once lived here.
He was a very famous
wildlife painter.
Hey, Sally, look.
You want to try?
What do you
have there?
- I found it.
- That's mine.
It was my grandmother's.
When I was little,
my mother gave it to me.
My mom gave me
to my dad.
: Sally?
You wanna see your room?
What do you think?
Kim and I worked really hard
to get it ready.
Check this out.
It's pretty great, huh?
It looks better
at night.
How long am I
staying here?
What did your mother tell you?
She told me
I was coming to visit.
But then she packed
all my clothes.
She didn't explain
anything to you?
- No.
- Sally.
Your mother and I
are worried about you.
She thinks that maybe you're, uh...
feeling sad...
and she thought that...
Well, we thought that...
perhaps a... a change
might... might be good for you
and that you could come
and live here
with... with Kim and me...
until we finish the work
on the house and... and sell it.
And then, uh... we could move
somewhere else and...
Sally? Come on.
Open the door.
Come on.
Let me in.
Are you going
to marry her?
Uh... that's between
Kim and me.
Mom said you only liked her
because she was young.
But she isn't.
She is old.
Sally.
Open the door.
Come on, sweetheart.
Open the door.
Sally, please,
let's talk about this.
Look, I know...
I know it must
be tough.
You had a long flight, and it's...
it's strange being in a new house.
I wanna go to bed now.
Okay.
Don't forget to
brush your teeth.
You'd be a terrible
poker player.
You've been ironing that shirt
for like, half-an-hour.
She sure didn't take to me.
I wouldn't take
it personally.
She's like that
with everybody.
Those pills she takes,
what are they?
Adderall, I think.
Jesus.
That's her mother
for you.
That woman medicated
our dogs.
So, what about Jacoby?
Well, his assistant said he still hasn't
looked at the new photographs yet.
- He's had them for a week.
- I know.
But we're still in the running,
and he's still coming to the dinner.
- He should just give us the cover.
- Yes, he should.
He gave it to the Spencer restoration
two years ago...
and you have
done miracles here.
We have done miracles here.
It's not all about me.
Thank you.
These are new?
- Yeah.
- Great.
Well, if we get the cover
of Architectural Digest,
we won't need to take out
another bank loan, will we?
You know what your daughter
told me today?
What?
She said your wife
gave her to you.
Kids say all kinds of things
they don't mean.
It couldn't have
gone any worse today.
I feel like
the evil stepmother.
The evil
and very old stepmother.
Let's not forget the old part.
'Cause I was kinda thinking
you were looking a little ancient.
- : Oh, yeah?
- Oh, yeah.
The stuffed bear?
What was I thinking?
Oh, come on. It's great.
She likes it. I saw it in her room.
: On her bed?
Well, above the bed.
Hanging by a noose.
That's okay. Nice sign
of affection, I think.
: Sally.
Her name is Sally.
Sally!
: What do you think?
Yeah. Looks great.
Have you seen Sally?
Yeah, she's
on the bench.
: Sally!
It is not safe
for you back here.
Hey. What's going on?
Everything okay?
Keep her out from
the back of the house.
She could fall in.
We'd be in a hell of a mess.
I didn't do anything.
There's pits.
Old wells.
It's dangerous
for a child.
Mr. Harris is right,
Sally. He knows.
His grandfather
worked at the house.
- You shouldn't be back here.
- But I found a basement.
There is no basement.
Easy, Harris.
I'll take her. It's okay.
It's there!
It's right there!
You know there's a reason
this house is called Fallen Mill.
The English had a mill here,
and it fell into a sinkhole.
That's why most of the houses
around here don't have basements.
This one does.
: You may wanna
check this out.
:
It's unsafe for a child.
Pull on that.
: Look!
I told you it was here!
: Can you believe this?
This is
definitely hollow.
I'm gonna get some tools.
You sure
you wanna do this now?
Of course!
You kidding?
We can fix this easy
if we have to.
You may wanna
step back.
: Mr. Hurst, I...
There's a door in here.
Where did you put
the old house keys?
They're in your junk drawer
in the office.
Okay.
Have a look.
: Oh, wow.
You be careful, Sally.
Okay?
Okay.
How the hell
did we miss this?
: That must be
the garden window.
: It's all of his paints
and old colored pencils.
This is amazing.
Wow.
Alex, look at this.
Harris, did you know
about this?
This place isn't safe.
Especially for kids.
It's okay.
I'll keep an eye on her.
This must be
where Blackwood worked.
:
I found another door.
:
Look at these sketches.
It's an ash pit,
I think.
Yeah.
It's bolted shut.
:
These are incredible.
: Okay.
Let's go, Sally.
Come on, Sally.
Let's go.
: Sally, come on.
This must be like
King Tut's tomb for you.
: Which is excatly why
we shouldn't be touching anything.
This stuff must
be valuable.
:
She's gone.
No, no, she will come back.
They always do.
Yes, they always do.
: I don't think
that's important, Alan.
No, I just need
to make sure I get
the paintings and furniture
back in time for the dinner.
You told me
you could.
Come on. How long
have we known each other?
I'll write you
a post-dated check.
Hold on.
It's either walnut or mahogany,
I think. Yeah.
Hey, there you are.
I thought maybe
we could bake scones.
I promised Mrs. Underhill
we wouldn't make too much of a mess.
No. That's all right.
What've you got there?
My doll.
And my drawing stuff.
: Looks like it's just you and I
baking scones today.
:
I made sandwiches for everyone.
:
Sally.
Open the grates!
Yes, yes,
open the grates.
Set us free!
Set us free!
Who are you?
What do you look like?
We've been locked
up for so long.
Set us free!
Come down. You'll see
what it's like down here.
Wait a minute, will ya?
There's other children down here.
They're just like you.
: Sally?
Sally.
What're you doing down here?
- I heard something.
- Rats, probably.
Come on,
it's time for dinner.
It was a voice.
Really smart rats, then.
No! Listen.
Nothing.
Come on, let's go, kiddo.
I forgot my bag.
Well, hurry up.
: Sally, now!
We can get this tomorrow.
We can't get the rest of these
for two weeks.
What about
the burnt umber?
It's much warmer, and we can get it
for half he price.
You not hungry?
Sally?
Don't you like rice?
Mrs. Underhill
made apple pie for dessert.
Apple pie has gluten,
and Mommy says gluten is bad
for my concentration.
Oh, come on.
You love apple pie.
We can worry about your
concentration tomorrow.
Mommy says no gluten.
What's your mother
filling your head with?
- How about some chocolate milk?
- No, no, no.
- I'll make something else.
- No. Hold on, hold on.
Sally,
you need to eat this,
or you can go to your room.
Okay?
Good night, Dad.
What?
Did that work on you
when you were a kid?
She's testing us, Kim.
That's what kids do.
Who's the parent here?
Certainly not me.
I didn't... mean that.
No... You're right.
I'm not a parent.
- We talked about this, remember?
- No, you told me about this, Alex.
I'm not sure I'm ready
to be anybody's mother.
- Oh, come on.
- I had a hard enough time...
getting over my own childhood...
to have to...
deal with somebody else's.
Listen, will you help me
out with this, please?
I realize this is terrible timing,
but I don't have a choice.
I can't...
I can't just send her back.
You know, that's not
what I'm asking you to do.
Apple pie.
Thanks.
- Hello?
- Hi, Alex, it's Joanne.
- Hi, Joanne.
- Can I speak to Sally?
- No, you can't.
- Why not?
Because she's asleep.
We're 3 hours ahead, remember?
What were you thinking
not telling her...
she was gonna be living here?
You and I had a conversation.
I asked you
if you wanted me to tell her.
Don't do this
every time I have...
You're the one
who wanted her here.
- : I love you. I love you.
-
Did... did you just
speak to me?
I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
: The light,
it hurts us.
Yeah. Turn out the light.
I love you.
Turn out the light.
We want to be friends.
Where's my doll?
:
With us. With us.
Sally's doll is with us.
Who are you?
We're your friends.
Friends?
Where?
:
Come down to the basement...
- and play with us.
- Where are you?
What are you?
: Hungry.
Hungry.
Very hungry.
I have food.
Let me see you.
I won't hurt you,
I promise.
: Sally?
- What you doing under there?
- I'm looking for my doll.
Looking for what?
I'm looking for my doll.
: Oh.
Well, uh...
Oh.
How about, the...
Teddy instead?
- No.
- I love you.
That's all right.
- Did you lose a tooth?
- That's not mine.
- I found it.
- You found it?
What?
Here in the house?
Yeah.
Come on.
Can I call Mommy now?
No, it's too late.
She's probably asleep.
I don't think you should keep this.
It's not very sanitary.
What about this light?
Should I...
Leave it on, please.
All right, well,
sleep well.
Oh, Sally,
would you do me a favor?
Would you try to,
maybe, be friends with Kim?
- Yes.
- Thanks, kiddo.
Kim, have you seen
my razor?
We have to leave
in five minutes.
- Yeah. You seen my razor?
- Here, take mine.
Five minutes.
My dress.
Sally. I wanna talk to you
downstairs right now.
: I cannot believe
you cut up Kim's clothes.
- : I didn't do it.
- Sally...
- I didn't do anything.
- Sally...
- I swear.
- Stop lying.
It was a horrible thing to do.
And it was dangerous.
You could've cut yourself.
What did you use,
my razor?
Let me see
your hands.
- It's mine.
- What is this?
Where'd you get this?
- Let me go home.
- You can't go home.
Just let me go home.
I'm sorry about this.
She's never done
anything like this before.
She's obviously very
angry about something.
Alex, that is not anger.
That is fear.
We need to go.
Mrs. Underhill,
Kim and I have an appointment
at the historical society.
We'll be back
this afternoon.
Sally, we're going out.
You listen to Mrs. Underhill
and do what she says.
And you think about
what you need to say to Kim, okay?
Are you there?
Did you cut
Kim's clothes?
Do you have
my dad's razor?
You have to tell me
the truth.
If you wanna be friends.
I won't be angry.
:
Sally's not angry.
:
They're angry.
:
No, I'm not angry.
:
They don't want to...
:
But we do.
:
Come down here, Sally.
Come down and play.
You said you
were hungry.
Do you like raisins?
:
We said we liked them.
See? Delicious.
Delicious. Yeah.
So delicious.
Did you do
something bad?
You have to answer
if you wanna be friends.
:
Yes, friend.
Sally?
What're you doing
down here in the dark?
Were you talking
to someone?
Is there someone
here with you?
No. I'm all alone.
There's nobody here.
Why don't you go help
Mrs. Underhill make lunch?
Go on.
Off you go now.
That's right. Up those steps!
Quick as you can, now!
:
Harris. You old fool.
: I swear.
I didn't tell them anything!
No.
No, please!
Get away!
I had an accident!
Call for help!
Oh.
Don't look.
: I could hear
screams down there.
- Noises.
- : Did you see anything?
:
He asked me to leave the cellar.
It was so dark in there,
he must have stumbled.
- Oh, Mr. Hurst, thank God!
- What happened?
- Are you William Harris' employer?
- Yeah.
There's been an accident.
Are you okay?
Where is Sally?
I'm sorry.
She saw him.
I tried to cover her eyes,
and I was too late.
- Where is she?
- She's in the garden.
Oh, I am sorry!
Sally?
Hi.
Are you scared?
Do you wanna talk about it?
Is Mr. Harris
gonna die?
No, Sally.
He is going
to be okay.
Can I show you something?
This is my favorite
part of the house.
Blackwood loved nature.
He imported these fish from Japan.
And so did we.
They're called Koi.
They're considered magical.
Badgers can spot them
against the mud at the bottom...
because of their
bright colors.
So what makes them
special...
is also what makes them
vulnerable.
They have to be tough.
And you, too, Sally.
I didn't touch your clothes.
I swear to God,
I never touched them!
- I didn't touch them.
- Sally.
I didn't!
Didn't cut them, I promise.
I don't care
about my clothes.
: I can't really tell.
It's hard to see.
The coin's pretty worn down.
She probably found it
in Blackwood's studio.
: I don't want her
going down there anymore.
I'm worried about her, Kim.
It's not safe.
- Hey. This is Joanne.
- Mommy?
Oh, sweetie, it's you!
How are you?
Can I come home?
- You wanna come home...
- The sashimi. Stuart, the sashimi.
- I don't like it here.
- You what?
Honey, don't fret.
It's so beautiful there.
You just need
to get used to it.
But it's cold.
- Huh, Honey, what?
- My bed is too big.
- Sweetheart.
- And I think I'm getting sick.
You're not getting sick.
Honey, it will take a little tiny bit
of getting used to,
but you are gonna be
so happy there.
Okay? I promise.
You'll get used to it.
I gotta go, honey.
Mommy's gotta go.
I'll see you soon. Bye!
Kim?
- Don't leave.
- What's wrong?
Even when I'm asleep.
And don't turn off
the lights.
I'll be right here.
Come on.
Kim?
: I love you.
I love you.
Daddy! Daddy!
Daddy, please!
Daddy!
Sally, what's the matter?
What's the matter?
I don't want them
to come anymore.
Who, Sally?
The little things.
They live in the basement.
They gave me the silver dollar.
They said they wanted to be
my friend.
But they're horrible
and mean.
Oh, Sally.
- You just had a nightmare.
- No, don't say that!
It's okay.
My bear.
Look what they did
to my bear.
Your dad tells me
art is your favorite subject.
I wish I could draw.
Drawing is easy.
The other kids
can't do feet and hands.
When you say "the other kids",
do you feel they're different from you?
My doctor back home
asked me that.
What was your answer?
Okay. Let's start
with something easier.
What's your favorite color?
What is that?
Purple?
Black.
How about these little things you saw?
What do you think they are?
Fairies.
Or gnomes.
But scary ones?
And you say they
know your name?
They talk to you?
Yes.
What do they say?
They want to play
with me.
Is that all?
They say my parents
don't love me.
Can I go now?
: Just a few
more questions, okay?
There is a lot of anxiety
in that little girl...
and a deep belief,
that she's not wanted.
I believe that's what's triggering
these fantastic episodes.
She told me
she found a little tray...
filled with teeth
right inside that fireplace.
Yeah. She found a tooth, but
that doesn't mean anything, does it?
She's constructing
this elaborate fantasy...
about wrinkles,
claws, fangs.
Now she's individuated
each one of those things,
her imaginary world,
its inhabitants.
It's as detailed as any
I've ever encountered.
What do we do?
I'd like to try her on a stronger
medication, for a start.
I'll ask her doctor in L.A.
to send me a copy of her charts.
You call my office,
make another appointment.
Okay, great.
Meanwhile, I'll give you something
to help her sleep.
I'm going to be late.
I can't believe it.
If we don't get the extension
on this loan,
we're not gonna get
the paintings or the furniture...
back on time.
We forgot the invitations
for the historical society.
Maybe we should just
postpone the dinner.
Kim,
it's Architectural Digest.
We have to get
the house on the cover.
- I know.
- If we don't,
I'm never gonna get
my career back,
and we're not gonna
sell the place.
- How often we've talked about this?
- What about whats...
been happening?
What, Harris?
That was an accident.
I'm talking about Sally.
These things...
- It's all in her head!
- Yeah, but it's real to her.
It doesn't matter
if we see it.
-
- Come on!
Calm down!
I'm gonna walk. It'll be faster.
I'll see you back at home.
I'm not sure
how lucid he'll be.
He's pretty
heavily sedated.
Mr. Harris,
I know this is difficult,
but I need to
understand something.
I need to know what Sally saw
so that I can help her.
Is she out
of the house?
No.
Out.
She needs to be
out of there.
Why?
Why was that
room sealed up?
Grandfather.
Your grandfather
closed it up?
Yes.
Why?
After...
After...
After what?
Blackwood.
What about Blackwood?
Lot 1134.
Public library.
: Get her
out of our house.
: The library
will be closing in 15 minutes.
The library will be closing
in 15 minutes. Thank you.
Excuse me.
Can I help you?
I'm looking for
the librarian.
Lot 1134.
Emerson Blackwood,
Special Collections. One sec.
Right this way.
Can't remember the last time
anyone requested these.
- They're beautiful.
- I'm a designer.
I've been working
at Fallen Mill.
Wow.
Now, that's a privilege.
Personally, I think
Emerson Blackwood rivaled Audubon.
Come across his mural?
A mural?
Where?
There in the house,
supposedly.
If you do,
I'd love to see it.
Hello?
Now, it's pretty ironic,
really.
For a committed realist,
someone who insisted
on drawing only from nature,
to do these
at the end of his life.
I've looked at everything
by Blackwood,
and I've never
seen any of these.
Oh, you wouldn't. The family made it
a restricted donation.
These may never
be published.
Is it possible
to get copies?
I'll see what I can do.
"Wrinkles, claws,
teeth?"
Have you ever
read Machen?
Arthur Machen. Welsh.
He believed
in fairy folk,
these ancient entities
from the netherworld,
predating mankind.
Blackwood
quotes him extensively.
Here, uh... that line.
There.
"One life
must be taken".
These creatures had to take
one human life...
every time they emerged
to replenish their ranks.
Many of these creatures
fed on the bones,
the teeth
of young children.
And then there's a... a truce,
a pact of sorts,
between Pope Sylvester the 2nd
and these ancient beings...
in the year 9 hundred
and 99.
In exchange
for human teeth,
they start leaving
silver pieces under the pillow.
Now, this... is the last known
drawing by Emerson Blackwood,
made shortly before his disappearance
and the loss of his child.
His child?
Blackwood's only son
vanished, lost.
Not long after,
Blackwood himself disappeared...
without a trace.
No!
No!
No! Please!
: No!
Sally!
Sally, what's wrong?
Sally, open the door!
Oh, my God!
Oh, oh.
Shh.
Dear,
thank goodness you're home.
Where is she?
I put her to bed.
She wouldn't
stop screaming.
Sally?
: Kim!
She's not down here.
I think she's run away.
She's done it before.
: You know, once she tried
to walk all the way back to L.A...
from our family home
in Boston.
I wouldn't be surprised
if that's what she's doing.
I went and visited
Harris today.
Blackwood had a son.
Did you know that?
And when he was eight,
he disappeared.
And Blackwood vanished
a few days later.
Why are you
telling me this?
A lot of what Blackwood wrote
at the end of his life,
it's awfully close
to Sally's story,
gnomes, creatures,
all of it.
Kim, don't tell me
you believe this.
Something terrible happened
in that basement.
We need to leave.
- Put a million miles between...
- What're you talking about?
- us and that house.
- Every cent I have...
is in that house. Okay?
And you're saying...
that we just walk away?
Look, I... I accept
that my daughter has problems, okay?
Thank you.
We all know that.
But they do not involve
monsters in the basement.
There she is.
Come on, Sally.
Get in the car.
Sally, please,
just tonight,
after the party
we'll talk, okay?
Four, three,
two and one.
There.
After the party,
I will get you outta here.
No matter what.
I promise.
- Sally!
- No.
I took it from them.
- You can't have this.
- They stoled it.
You don't understand.
I need it to fight back.
- Absolutely not.
- Please!
: Nobody believes me.
Sally, I trust you,
and you can tell me anything,
anything at all.
They don't like
bright lights either.
These things.
They don't?
Then I have a good idea.
Mr. Jacoby, I am so glad
you could make it.
- Alex, call me Charles.
- Charles.
- My wife, Evelyn.
- Hello, Alex.
It's a pleasure.
Come on in.
The house looks
absolutely fantastic.
You done
a remarkable job.
Well, thank you.
We'd love
the nickel tour.
Of course.
That's the whole point.
The foyer, obviously.
The, uh, the mahogany, we shipped
from the very same vendor...
that Blackwood
used in London.
It's been in business
since 1865.
You know Bill from the...
heritage board.
Easy, Sally. Not everybody wants to have
their photograph taken, okay?
So, Alex,
where's Kim?
Uh... I think she's still
upstairs.
Why don't you step into the library,
grab a drink,
and I'll, uh...
I join you there in a moment.
Kim, hey,
what's going on?
Her drawings. They're exactly
Blackwood's sketches.
Yeah, I'm sure she probably saw
your photographs and copied them.
No, she didn't.
Kim, please,
Jacoby's here.
- Alex, this is your daughter!
- I know.
This is serious!
Just because you keep
denying it does not mean...
- it's not happening.
- Kim, I can't do...
Excuse me, Mr. Hurst.
- When should we serve dinner?
- Ten minutes, please.
Kim, everybody is waiting.
Will you come downstairs?
- We can talk about this later.
- No.
- I have proof, Dad. Look!
- Not now, honey.
- Please!
- Not now. Come on!
Welcome, everybody.
Please, have a seat.
Uh... if I could just say
a few words...
to all of you friends
of Fallen Mill,
both big and small.
Um... thank you
for joining us this evening.
It means
a great deal to us.
Every aspect of this restoration, um...
has followed the exact specifications...
and materials used in the original
construction of the house, um...
including the wood assembling
techniques, the layout in the kitchen,
even the, uh... lacquering process
for all the timber.
It's something Kim and I
are very proud of, I'm sure all of you,
with your vast array
of expertise, will, uh...
appreciate
the attention to detail.
Um... the art you see on the walls,
the friezes,
even the furniture
that you're sitting on,
uh, has all been meticulously chosen,
reassembled or restored,
depending on its condition,
uh, to, I think, truly represent
the essence of the Blackwood collection.
Uh... so, thank you
to the heritage board...
for their assistance,
and to the historical society too.
Um...
and of course, to our guest of honor,
Charles Jacoby.
Your, uh...
your interest
in our projects, um...
is nothing short of inspirational.
So, thank you.
And, uh... finally,
to the house itself.
May its newly restored life
be long and happy.
I guess not everybody is a fan
of tonight's menu.
: Poor Sally.
No one believes you.
: Sally.
What do you want?
Please just tell
me what you want!
We want you!
: Daddy!
Daddy, please!
Daddy!
: Sally?
- Daddy!
- Sally?
Daddy!
Daddy, they're in here!
Open the door!
Sally!
Charles.
: What's going
on in there?
-
-
No! Get off of me!
Stop it!
: Sally!
Sally. Sally.
Look at me.
Sally, look at me. Look at me.
Picture,
I took a picture.
I think we better
call it a night.
I think we should.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Alex, can I talk to you?
I feel like I have
no idea what to do.
I love my daughter, Kim,
and I love you.
I love you, too.
We should go, right?
- I'll get Sally ready.
- I'll get the car.
- Will you put this in the car?
- Yeah.
: Kim?
Hi.
Where are we going?
We're gonna go
to a hotel downtown.
We're gonna get you
out of here.
Alex?
Alex?
Alex?
It's okay, it's okay.
:
A life will be taken.
One life must be taken.
A life will be taken.
One life must be taken.
Sally.
Sally!
Child's teeth!
Kim?
Kim?
Kim?
Daddy?
Kim?
Kim?
Kim!
Kim! Please.
Kim.
Wake up, please!
:
Wake up, Kim. Wake up, Kim.
Wake up Kim.
Wake up Kim.
Wake up, Kim.
The key. The key.
Kim, please!
Daddy! No!
Kim!
-
- : Kim, please!
Sally?
Ah.
Ah!
Sally? Sally!
: Kim!
: Let go of me!
Don't make me go in there!
Kim! Please!
Kim?
Kim?
- Please, Kim!
- I'm here, Sally!
: No, please!
Sally!
Kim?
No! Go away!
: Hold on!
Hold on! I got you.
Keep them away, Sally.
Use the light. Use the light.
Kim!
Get him.
No! Please!
Get away from me!
Get off of me!
When I cut this rope, Sally,
you run!
Please!
You run!
You got that?
No, what about you?
No! Please!
: Be strong.
Kim!
No!
Sally?
Sally?
Sally, are you okay?
Sally.
: Alex?
Kim!
Kim!
Kim!
Dad?
Daddy?
Daddy.
Please!
That's far enough, Sally.
I love you, Kim.
: They will find us.
They will find us and hurt us.
We must fight.
:
No, we will go deeper,
and we will wait.
They will forget,
and others will come.
:
When will they come?
When will we get them?
: Soon, soon.
- We have all the time in the world.
- Yes.
:
All the time in the world.
:
All the time in the world.
