Mom? Knock, knock.
Oh, it is too early for "Knock, knock."
Now, come on, eat up. We're running late.
Chris, give me a break!
Does it have to be World War II
this morning?
Cute, kid.
LISA: 8:30, Cal!
- Why didn't you tell me it was so late?
- I just did.
- Dad?
- What?
- Knock, knock.
- Who's there?
- Dwayne.
- Dwayne who?
Dwayne the bathtub, I'm dwowning!
That's terrible!
That's not my lunch, is it?
Well, not now, it isn't.
- When did your friends leave this morning?
- Oh, I thought they were your friends.
Well, they left about 3:00.
You used to be able to go all night.
Yeah, I know, but I can't do it anymore.
What can't you do anymore?
CAL AND LISA: Eat your breakfast.
Do you think they would have taken the hint
if I had served the last drink in my pajamas?
LISA: Come on, kiddo. Shoes and socks on.
Let's go. Come on.
CAL: Oh, shit.
LISA: Oh, great.
- Terrific, Cal.
- I got it.
No, no, not the socks!
- Hit the showers.
- Right.
CHRIS: Mom?
What?
Coffee machine.
- Oh, perfect!
-
Mom. Mom!
Mom! Mom!
Mom!
Dad, help!
Dad!
What is it? What is... Oh, Jesus!
- Mom! Dad!
- Lisa, no! Oh, my God, no!
Chris, don't touch her!
Don't touch her!
Mom!
Oh, Jesus Christ!
-
- Mom!
- CHRIS: Dad!
- Oh, my God! Christ!
Chris, Chris.
Por favor, don't break nothing!
And be careful from the walls.
Mrs. Hallidayjust painted them.
Follow me, okay?
CAL: You did what anyone
would have done.
FRANK: It happened so fast.
I just reacted.
He was trying to help.
Christ, the man's got four kids!
Don't you think you'll be more effective
when you do go back out there,
if you begin to forgive yourself?
That's what this is all about, Frank.
That's how I can help you, if you'll let me.
Yeah.
Yeah, I want to. It's...
I do. It's, uh...
Good.
Well, I'd say we made
a pretty good beginning, wouldn't you?
Yeah.
CAL: I'll set you up for next week, then.
What have you got there, little guy?
- Chief Black Cloud.
- Yeah?
Are you sick?
I'm sorry.
- You can call me anytime.
- Right.
See you next Thursday.
Hopefully we'll be
a little better settled in by then.
- Thank you, Doctor.
- You're welcome.
- Are you all right, Bean?
- Mmm-hmm.
Not so fast, my friend.
From now on, I don't think it's a good idea
for you to play in here while Dad's working.
Is it a deal?
Okay. What do we got here?
Flowers. Mrs. Ruiz and I
are gonna plant some for Mom.
Like these?
Mom wants me to.
Do you believe me?
I believe she would want you to. Sure.
JESSICA: Take it easy, you guys.
I just finished painting this place.
Oh, wait a moment.
No! My wall! My beautiful wall!
I finished this whole wall
with my own hands
and now it looks like my first apartment.
- Well, it's just a little gouge.
-It's a giant crater!
I'm gonna have to start from scratch!
Fill it, sand it!
-
- MAN 1: All right, all right.
What's the problem?
This. Now, 10 years ago,
I wouldn't have minded.
But now I want a wall to look like a wall.
You know what I mean?
MAN 2: I'm nearly finished.
Let me take a look at it.
- Oh, no, no, no. You don't have to do that.
- It's okay. I'm taking care of it.
Well, thank you very much. That's great.
Who says chivalry is dead?
Alive and well in New York. Amazing.
So, how does it feel to have your whole life
stuffed in little boxes?
A little cramped.
Yeah. Now, here's the number for
the electrician. He's expecting your call.
Painter's coming on Sunday, and I'll get
to the kitchen faucet as soon as I can.
You gonna fix it yourself?
Sure. I'm the landlady.
Hey, listen, I lost one of my earrings.
I think it might be in your apartment.
It's pretty hard to miss.
Then, it might be in my bag.
But if you see it, will you let me know?
I'll keep an eye out.
- Great. How is Carmen working out?
- Just fine, thank you.
She's terrific with Chris.
Oh, shit!
The stream of cops through here
is going to do wonders
for my parking ticket situation.
Maybe I can put in a word
for you downtown.
Listen, if there's anything else you need,
I'm right across the street.
Hey, Officer? Uh, listen, honey.
Have you started writing that thing out yet?
CHRIS: Hey, come on, I want the ball.
- Look out! Whoa.
-
- The ball is in the clear. He scores!
- Dad, wait! Wait for me!
CAL: Marty Wertheimer, please.
- WOMAN:  Who's calling?
-It's Cal Jamison.
- Can you hold?
- Yes, I'll hold.
MARTY'. I told you never to call me here.
What do you want? I'm a busy man.
Hi, buddy, how are you?
Great, great.
So, is that a great apartment or what, huh?
Do you know what I had
to do to get that? Huh?
So, uh, by the way,
where's my commission?
Hey, shut up already. You done great.
It's wonderful. No complaints.
- So where are you? You're 15 minutes late.
- I'm in the park.
The park? What are you doing in the park?
You're supposed to be here.
I'm on my way. I've got Chris with me.
- It's okay if I bring him?
- Oh, yeah, please.
Uh, okay. See you soon, Marty.
Chris!
-
- CAL: Chris!
Chris?
OFFICER: This is unusual for Central Park.
What are you doing down here?
WOMAN: What do you mean,
what am I doing?
I'm jogging. I run here every day.
OFFICER: Did you see anyone else here?
WOMAN: No, no one else was here. Just me.
OFFICER: Is this all you saw?
WOMAN: What? That's all I saw...
OFFICER: Please, calm down, Miss.
What were you doing here?
WOMAN: What am I doing down...
I run here every day.
My girlfriend and I usually run.
Today, she had to go to the dentist.
I just want to take a bit
of information from you, please.
Information?
- I need a little information.
- What kind of information?
- Like your name first, please.
- Oh, my name?
- OFFICER: Yes.
- My name is Muriel Greenburg.
OFFICER: Do you spell Greenburg
G-R-E-E-N-B-E-R-G?
No. B-U-R-G. Greenburg.
Miss, this is in case
I have more information later on.
- Okay, what's your address?
- CAL: Chris!
Sorry.
OFFICER: What apartment is that?
Come on, honey.
Okay, folks, the show is over!
Come on, it's a beautiful day,
I'm sure you can find something else
better to do than look at this garbage.
Come on, start moving.
Come on, get out of here! Let's go!
I said keep moving. Let's go...
OFFICER: That's it. Keep going.
OFFICER: All right, just keep going away.
That's it.
Dad, do you believe in God?
I believe in a god.
What you got there?
May I?
- Where'd you get this?
- Foundit
- Where?
- In the park.
Where in the park?
Somewhere. It's a wishing shell.
How do you know that?
I just do.
Where is he? Where is he?
Where is this guy?
Hey, there he is.
- Hi, Marty.
- Hey, Chris, how are you doing?
I've been waiting
all morning for you, you know that?
- How are you, Marty?
- Who's this bum you're dragging around?
You know, you gotta watch these guys
that hang out in the park.
- What's this?
- What?
Bubble gum?
Didn't your dad ever show you
where to park your gum?
- Where?
- On the bedpost, for crying out loud.
Look, you got any questions
about important stuff like this,
you come ask your lawyer. All right?
- Okay.
- Okay. I ever show you this one?
Twice.
Okay, wise guy, you get them apart.
I'll bring him right back. Promise.
Linda.
- Coffee?
- No.
One. Regular. Thanks.
Now, wait a minute, wait a minute.
We're in agreement, right?
So... So, what's the problem?
I don't have any problem with
the idea of a lawsuit, Marty.
The point is
I don't want Chris to have to relive it all.
Neither do I.
But that coffee machine
was fuckin' defective
and we gotta nail the bastards
so no one else gets killed.
So long as Chris doesn't have to testify.
I mean it, Marty.
- I feel very strongly about this.
- You and me both.
Look, this will not go to trial.
I promise you. They'd be crazy.
They'll settle. Do you smoke?
No, thanks, I quit.
Yeah, me, too.
I quit at least twice this week already.
Thanks.
I love Chris, you know that. He's a great kid.
Tell you the truth,
he's not the one I'm worried about.
- I'm all right.
- That's it? "I'm all right"?
You spend your time
listening to these cops' problems,
you can't even talk about your own?
It's lonely.
Yeah?
I'm trying to pick up the pieces.
Yeah.
It really feels strange being back.
Oh, the city's changed a lot.
Yeah, some days I'm not so sure
it was a good idea to bring Chris here.
But in a funny way,
it's brought us closer together.
If you need anything, anything at all,
I'm there before you hang up the phone.
- You know that.
- I know.
-I feel better. You feel better?
- I feel better.
Sit down. Sit down. Sit down.
Uh, uh, Linda? You want to send in
Mr. Jamison, Esquire, please?
CAL: What is this?
My 11:00 number.
Come on in, kid. Sit down.
Get a load of this.
CAL: Don't run on the stairs.
-
- CHRIS: Cheating!
No, no, no, no!
Iwin.
CHRIS: Cheater.
Hi, Carmen. Any calls?
No calls.
But this come for you.
Hey. From where?
It's a housewarming present
from Mrs. Halliday.
Oh.
- She make it herself, for you.
- Wasn't that nice?
It's very beautiful, sf?
Stunning.
OFFICER: Are there any more
of these perishables, ma'am?
WOMAN:
No, this is only dry stuff and spices.
OFFICER:
Okay, and did you buy this here, the radio?
WOMAN: This is from London.
OFFICER: I'm just gonna have to take
this apart. I'll put it back for you.
WOMAN'.  Arriving passengers
who have cleared customs,
please place your luggage
on the conveyor belt...
Can I see that?
OFFICER: Open this, please.
MAN: Just personal items.
No need to look in there.
OFFICER: All right.
Do you remember this bowl?
That little Indian boy made it.
- Yeah, we have one just like it.
- Oh, you do? I love the things he made.
-...and cilantro.
- How's it going?
Mmm! Mmm!
Ambrosia.
- Ambrosia!
- Here, here, taste. Taste.
Well? What do you think? Don't be bashful.
- I'm inured to criticism.
- Hot.
Oh, nonsense. Good for you.
Therapeutic, anti-depressant.
Mmm.
- News to me.
- I stand before you, living proof.
You put the NYPD on gumbo twice a week,
and you're out of business.
Why don't you give that a good stir
and then we'll bring in the rice, huh?
That's a useless knife.
Useless knife. I'll have to get another.
It's lovely. Who gave it to you?
I found it.
Really? Here. Show it to Dennis.
Dennis, look.
- What's this?
- My shell.
Oh.
- It's your shell, is it?
- Yep.
You seem pretty sure about that.
Yep.
It's a beautiful piece of work.
Have you seen this, Kate?
Yes.
You still got that thing, Chris?
That's his wishing shell.
Now...
What do you suppose
you could make out of this?
I don't know.
What about a necklace?
That's the day we went to Osage.
The reservation. Remember that?
- Remember that, Chris?
- Yeah, and the day I got Chief Black Cloud.
KATE: That's right.
CHRIS: And Dennis bought me
the arrowheads.
God. Got a memory like an elephant.
Oh, look.
CHRIS: There's Mom.
KATE: Mmm.
Ah, she looked so pretty.
Well, that was a very happy day, wasn't it?
KATE: My prize pupil.
CHRIS: In anthropology?
KATE: Mmm.
I always thought one day,
she'd be teaching me.
Oh, look at that face.
DENNIS: Oh, that was the day we went
to visit the Ojibwa. Remember, Chris?
CHRIS: Oh, yeah.
DENNIS: About 40 degrees below zero.
They had fires inside the tent.
It must have been 70 degrees below,
with the wind chill.
It was quite a day, wasn't it?
CHRIS: How do they stay warm...
I'm sorry.
I remember taking those pictures.
That was the last time we were all together.
Oh, my, my, my. mY-
How does Chris seem to you?
Does he seem all right?
- He's a remarkable little boy.
- I think he's doing all right, actually.
Thanks, Kate.
Come on.
Come on.
The kitchen all fixed up, Dr. Jamison.
Thank you, Carmen.
You gotta stay back here!
- I'm sorry, miss. You can't get...
- WOMAN: Can I get through?
- Where is he?
- He's inside.
- Lopez call this in?
- Yeah. He did.
Where is he?
He's up behind the screen.
We can't get near him.
Keeps asking for you.
- What do you got?
- We got a dead kid.
LOPEZ: I want you to understand that!
Can you tell how old he is?
Jesus, he only looks to be about 9 years old.
He's only a kid.
There's so much blood. Look at those ashes.
They go completely around
where the body was.
OFFICER: It looks like a Cult.
Jesus Christ almighty.
LOPEZ: Just get McTaggert here, that's all.
Just don't you come any closer, all right?
Don't come any closer!
Just don't do it.
Just quit fuckin' around with me!
Nobody's fucking around with you, Tom.
Did you call this in?
- I called it in, Lieutenant, yes.
- What's the problem?
Jesus Christ, did you see
what they did to that kid in there?
- Did you see?
- Yeah. I saw. What do you know about it?
- They took my badge.
- Who took your badge? Who took it?
Who took it, Tom? Come on, now.
- You don't know what they could do to me.
- Tom, come on.
You did a good job on this one, now
we're on top of it. You gotta let us have it.
We're gonna go down to the station house
and we're gonna make a report.
No!
You can't stop them.
You can't do anything.
You don't understand anything.
Come on.
-
- Come on, Tom.
It doesn't work!
I'll be safe.
OFFICER 1: Get the gun!
OFFICER 2: All right, hold him down!
Get him the hell out of here, fast!
LOPEZ: Why did you stop me?
We can't do anything!
Oh, McTaggert. Get it straight!
They know who I am!
LOPEZ: Let go! I'm a cop, too!
God damn you!
McTaggert! McTaggert!
CHRIS: Dad! Dad!
Dad! Dad!
Dad!
- I'm here, Chris!
- Dad!
- It's all right, honey, I'm here. It's okay.
- Dad!
- It's all right, sweetheart. Here, it's all right.
-
It's just a bad dream. It's just a bad dream.
It's all right, baby.
It's all right, baby. It's all right.
Dad...
- Hello?
- MCTAGGERT: Is this Dr. Jamison?
Speaking.
Good. This is Lieutenant McTaggert,
It's a hell of a way to start your Sunday,
but I got your number from Psych Services.
I'm at Bellevue, and we got an officer
in a lot of trouble down here.
I'd appreciate that.
It's McTaggert, and I'll be waiting for you
at Psychiatric Emergency.
- All right, give me about 20 minutes, okay?
-Thank you.
CAL: I understand you were working
undercover on the disappearance
of some kids in Spanish Harlem.
Isn't that right, Tom?
May I call you Tom?
Are you Catholic?
Yes, I am. I'm not a practicing Catholic.
They know who I am!
Who are "they," Tom?
Oh, no, no, no, no.
How do I know about you?
All right, I understand.
You have no reason to trust me yet.
But you don't have any reason
to distrust me, do you?
The spirits help them.
They walk through walls.
- Don't forget that.
- I won't.
And they can see us in here right now,
is that it?
What is it? Easy.
They knew that I was on to them.
I walked in and they were waiting for me.
- Can you identify them?
- No. When I came to, I found the body.
They got my shield. Don't you get it?
Yes.
Oh, they're going to kill me.
No,no,no.
- I can feel it's started already.
- No, no.
Nobody can harm you in here.
I promise you that.
God can't save you.
The church can't save you.
They get right inside your body!
You can't stop them.
Seven powers.
You... You think that you can stop them?
You think science can stop them?
- Oh, dear God...
- It's all right. It's all right.
The eyes.
I saw his eyes!
Whose eyes, Tom?
Whose eyes?
They can get to anyone.
They can kill anybody!
You want them to know who you are?
DO you?
What do you think,
is he gonna come out of it?
I don't know. I need more time with him.
- He was one of my best guys.
- Maybe I should see the victim.
- You sure about that?
- Yeah.
It's the kid's parents.
Jesus.
What kind of a monster does that?
Been down the freezer again,
eh, Lieutenant?
You're a real comedian, Rob.
Don't be a stranger. Hit me again.
No, thank you. Just coffee, please.
So,
did we treat cops for alcohol abuse
back in, where was it? Milwaukee?
Minneapolis.
Oh, Minneapolis.
What the hell brought you to New York?
You don't mind my asking?
No, I went to graduate school at Columbia.
Uh, nice school, shitty neighborhood.
You got a family?
I have a son.
Thank you.
I lost my wife recently.
I'm sorry to hear that.
So what did Lopez have on this?
Can I see his reports?
No.
Why not?
- They're not available.
- Hope you're off duty, Lieutenant.
Fuck off.
Is Lopez Catholic?
Yeah, sure. The family is Cuban.
They practice this thing called Santeria.
- Ever hear of that?
- No.
It's a Latin thing.
A lot of them are into it up there.
They cut up chickens, magic, shit like that.
- And Lopez is into this?
- Yeah. He kept it quiet, but...
You said he found the body on an altar,
with a lot of religious paraphernalia, right?
There's at least 200 places sell that shit,
East Island alone.
Wait a second, please.
If I'm evaluating a patient,
I'd call that a pretty strong lead.
Wouldn't you?
A citizen's got a right to his own religious
preference. That's the First Amendment.
If a citizen performs a human sacrifice,
I'd say he forfeits that right.
Come on. A psycho kills a kid,
he makes it look like a religious ritual.
That kid was cut up with the precision
of a surgeon, not a psychopath.
What are you afraid of,
that Lopez is a suspect?
That it's one of your own?
It's not this religion, is it?
I don't call cutting up chickens a religion!
Maybe if you spent as much time
in a barrio as I have,
you wouldn't ask such dumb questions.
That's bullshit.
Just one last question, Lieutenant.
Is this all the assistance
I'm gonna get trying to help that officer?
Think about it.
Thanks for the coffee.
Oh, no! My clothes!
CAL". "Santeria is 1,000 years older
than Christianity...
"Their African gods are hidden
in Catholic saints.
Hey, come on, get this cleaned up.
Oh, God.
- Hi.
- Hi.
You forgot your watch.
Did I?
You must have left it
when you were painting the other day.
You forgot these, too.
They're a little soggy.
- Thanks.
- Still can't find the earring.
Want to come in?
Yes.
Thank you.
You know, I have no idea what
I would've done without the watch.
You suppose my leaving it
was some hidden expression of desire?
I don't know about that,
but my returning it certainly was.
How long's it been?
About nine months.
Would she approve?
I approve.
I went a whole year after my divorce.
When was that?
About a year ago.
But who's counting?
- Didn't you used to live in New York?
- Mmm-hmm.
Back when I was young and foolish.
What does that make you now?
I should probably get back.
Hurry up, Chris. We'll miss the show!
Now, Cal, there's time for at least
another half a glass.
- There's a good fellow.
- As you wish, madam.
And you, madam. How about you, Carmen?
- Come on, you're no stranger to the grape.
- Oh, no, no.
Sounds like a lot of fun.
I haven't been to the planetarium
since I was a little girl.
So why don't you join us?
As we begin ourjourney
to the beginning of time.
What are you looking for, Bean?
- Where's my shell?
- I don't know.
Where is it? Did she take it?
Just a minute, young man!
Chris, come back here!
Hey!
What do you think you're doing?
- It was an accident!
- It was not an accident!
It was!
- I'll go.
- Don't... Don't worry about it.
- It's no big deal.
- CAL: He's tired. You know he didn't...
- That's all right, Carmen. I'll get it.
- It's no problem.
Just a minute, what is that?
That's one of my hankies, isn't it? May I?
- What did she say?
- She said that she did it.
It's not anything bad.
JESSICA:
She says she's a kind of matchmaker.
A yenta. You know what a yenta is?
Yeah. What's that got to do with this?
That's my earring.
She said she's cast a love spell on us.
- That's ridiculous.
- JESSICA: Well, I'm sorry you feel that way.
This is nothing bad.
You're such a nice couple.
Hey, don't look at me.
I like a guy, maybe I'll change my perfume,
but I've got my pride.
Hello.
What can I do for you, Lieutenant?
MCTAGGERT:
Has Tom Lopez tried to call you?
MCTAGGERT:
He took a hike from Bellevue last night.
MCTAGGERT: We got another kid
like the one from the movie house.
Hey, look over there. What's that?
- Lieutenant.
- How are you?
The body is down here.
Worse than the one before.
- How old is he?
- Uh...
Eight, 10. No I.D. He's a black kid.
Watch your step. It's a tough climb.
They didn't tell me this was part of the job.
MCTAGGERT:
They don't tell you a lot of things.
MAN 1: It's just like the kid in the theater.
My God.
MAN 2: He's been here a couple of days.
You got the red and black candles,
you got the ashes, the circle of ashes.
And a bottle of gasoline.
MAN 1: Look at the way he's out up.
MAN 2: So much blood.
OFFICER: Hey, Bob, get a load of this.
What do you think?
Oh, Jesus Christ!
How do you ever get used to it?
You don't.
Now maybe you know why
a lot of cops hit the bottle.
Listen, Doc.
Newspapers get wind
that some psycho cop is doing this,
my job gets tougher,
and it's shitty enough as it is.
Do me a favor. No details to anybody, huh?
Psycho cop?
MCTAGGERT: What do you think?
A few hours on the couch
and Lopez was gonna get himself together?
You don't know that he did it.
I don't know that he didn't.
Lopez hasn't called you, has he?
No.
Weird fucking city you moved into, Doc.
MAN: Lopez.
Dig, I'm a hardcore rapper
from my head to my toe
Excuse me, sir.
Could I talk to you for a second, please?
What do you want?
I'm looking for the man that wrote
this book. Oscar Sezine. Is he here?
Uh, we're closed.
No, wait a second, sir.
I just need a minute of his time.
Believe me, it's very important.
- There is no one here.
- No, no, wait a second. Sir!
Sir!
I'm with Psych Services,
NYPD!
Sir!
Thanks a lot!
CAL: Carmen.
Carmen.
What is all this stuff?
What are these things?
You did put them in Chris's room,
didn't you?
- Si.
- I want to know why.
To bless him. I'm trying to help him.
I'm trying to help him, too.
Sometimes these things are used in rituals,
aren't they?
Sometimes those rituals involve
the sacrificing of animals, don't they?
Sometimes.
What is the circle of ashes for?
Circle of the ashes?
I don't know nothing about that.
- That's not a part of Santeria?
- No.
All right, now listen to me. If I find any more
of this kind of stuff around here again
I'm going to have to let you go.
Is that clear?
I don't care what it's for.
It's a lot of superstitious nonsense to me.
And I don't want
any more of it in the house.
Do you want any of these things
'cause I'm just gonna throw them away.
JESSICA: Okay, now, which one of
these guys do you want?
How about that guy? He looks pretty neat.
It's your birthday,
you can have any one you want.
Come on, Bean,
you've gotta make up your mind.
- I'll take that.
- This one?
Okay, happy birthday, Chris.
What do you say to Jessica?
Thanks.
CAL: Why are you such a sad sack today?
Three ices, please. Hurry up, you guys.
Lemon.
- What flavor do you want?
- I don't want any.
Come on, Chris, sure you do.
No, I don't!
I'm sorry.
- Hey, Chris, this is really...
- No!
Chris!
JESSICA: Chris!
-
- Chris!
CAL: Chris!
Chris!
Chris!
Chris!
CHRIS: Oh!
- God damn it!
- No!No!No!
- Don't you ever...
- I don't want her toy!
I don't want anything from her!
She's not my mom! I want my mom!
Shut up and listen to me!
Do you know you almost killed yourself!
- CAL: I want my mom!
- Oh, God.
CAL: Come back here! Chris!
KATE: Sure, and you've got lots of magic...
-
- Oh, here they are.
KATE AND DENNIS: Happy birthday, Chris!
CAL: Chris.
I'm sorry, Chris.
Honey, I'm so sorry I hurt you.
Listen to me.
You know I loved your mother very,
very much, and I'll always love her.
But she's gone now.
- You don't care that she went away!
- That's not true.
- You wouldn't care if I went away!
- No, no.
You know that's not true.
Now, listen to me.
You hit me!
I'm sorry I hit you.
I promise I'll never hit you again.
I'll never do anything to hurt you.
You mean more to me
than anyone else in the world.
Don't you know that?
I love you so much.
Please forgive me.
I just wanted him
to have a really nice birthday.
- Well, he still can.
- It's not over yet.
- I didn't mean any harm.
- Of course you didn't.
You know how children are
with new people.
Dr. Jamison.
Dr. Jamison, el telefono.
I'll take it up here, Carmen!
Hello.
-It's Lopez.
- Tom, where are you?
There's a diner on 126th and Lexington.
Come alone, okay? Just you.
You're in danger. You and your son. Hurry.
- Hey, are you okay?
- Huh? Si.
MAN: Oh, no!
OFFICER: Come on, back.
It's all right. Let him through.
Get the cab outta here.
What the hell are you doing here?
Lopez called me. He told me to be here.
Goddamn it, then why didn't you call me?
We're supposed to be working together.
- Please, ma'am, stand back.
- Where should I eat?
OFFICER: Did you know him?
MAN: No. I don't.
- So, he was never here, before?
- I have never seen him before.
MCTAGGERT:
What'd he tell you when he called?
Nothing. He just told me to meet him.
OFFICER: Did you understand
anything he was saying?
Who the hell is Culebras?
Nobody, sir. That means "snakes."
Snakes?
Uh, did he, uh... Did he do anything else
before he started screaming?
MAN: Yes.
He was writing, and then he took the knife
and stabbed himself.
- OFFICER: Where did he get the knife?
- From behind the counter. I was using it.
Does that mean anything to you?
MCTAGGERT: I'm talking to you in English,
you're talking to her in Spanish.
What is this, a goddamn
three ring circus, huh?
I'm, uh... I'm asking you,
you giving me a hard time or something?
- I'm not giving you a hard time.
- Are these all the files in this place,
-is all I'm asking you?
- I got it here.
CAL: Oscar Sezine?
- Yes.
- Why wouldn't you talk to me before?
Did you bring the police in here?
- Hey, you, Sezine.
- Yes?
Come on, get in here. I wanna talk to you.
Who is this guy? A friend of yours?
What the hell is this place
supposed to be, anyway?
This is a licensed drug rehab center, huh?
Our doors are open to any troubled children.
We offer them help, assistance...
Yeah, yeah, I know that.
Even your own kid OD'd, huh?
Yes.
Does that have anything
to do with why you're here?
Hey, wise guy-
I'm here to talk to you about Tom Lopez.
Did you know he was a cop?
Yes. He's also a volunteer on staff.
He teaches boxing.
Coaches our Golden Gloves.
MCTAGGERT: No, not anymore, he doesn't.
He killed himself about an hour ago.
OSCAR: I'm shocked.
MCTAGGERT: I bet you are.
This kid here, Louis Montana,
is he part of
your drug rehabilitation program?
He was. He ran away last week.
Is that right?
And did you see him after he ran away?
No.
- Did Tom Lopez know him?
- Yes, I believe he coached him.
Then he knew him.
You saw them together?
Yes, Why?
We found Louis Montana's body
on a barge in the Hudson River yesterday.
Now, you wouldn't happen to know
anything about that, would you, Mr. Sezine?
Certainly not.
Mr. Sezine, you have a right
to remain silent.
Anything you say could be used against
you in a court of law.
You have the right to an attorney and if you
can't afford one, we'll provide one for you.
Is that clear?
Hey, you! Get the hell out of here!
Go on! Get out!
Fuck off.
You know what I'd really like to do?
I'd like to put this monkey on a grill
and fry his ass
until I get some straight fucking answers
about this Santeria bullshit
from you people.
That's my card. Number at the precinct.
You call me tomorrow
between 10:00 and 11:00. Don't forget.
CAL: He hasn't slept for two days.
If you're not a cop, what are you?
I'm a therapist.
Tom Lopez is one of my patients.
I'm really very sorry about all this.
My God, do you really think we are savages?
That we'd be capable of killing children?
You said in your book that human sacrifice
was practiced at one time.
Name me one religion where atrocities have
not been committed in the name of a god.
Santeria is a force for good.
It is not a blood-cult
trading on innocent lives!
- Then what are you people so afraid of?
- Of your ignorance.
Of your prejudice,
because you use it as a weapon against us.
Tom Lopez was a good and decent man.
He was devoted to these children.
I don't believe he committed suicide.
I don't believe he had anything
to do with that outrage!
Neither do I.
Robert Calder
is the chairman of your board?
Yes. He's our major contributor.
- He's not into Santeria?
- No.
Did Lopez know him?
We all do. He organizes our fundraisers.
Yeah, it says here there's a fundraiser
later on this week.
Could you arrange for me to go?
Yes.
- Dad, can we stop by the church?
- Why, Bean?
I want to light a candle for Mom.
MAN: Hey, Freddie, how are you?
This is chekete.
Oh, well, I'd prefer a vodka tonic.
I'm afraid this is all we are serving.
It's traditional.
It is also traditional to sip it slowly.
I can see that.
Our host. Excuse me.
JESSICA: Robert Calder. Quite a guy.
CAL: What do you know about him?
JESSICA: Not much. Self-made man.
He took a share in one midtown building
and turned it into a fortune.
Getting into everything these days.
Money markets, energy, the whole bit.
The person I spoke to you about
would like to meet you.
May I introduce Dr. Cal Jamison?
- How do you do, sir.
- How do you do?
- This is my friend, Jessica Halliday.
- Hello.
- Pleased to meet you.
- Miss Halliday,
I'm Jennifer, Mr. Calder's assistant.
Oscar's told me of your interest.
Well, actually, a friend of mine
told me about your organization.
I'm very impressed.
Well, you're the sort
of man we're looking for.
Really?
I understand you knew my friend.
Officer Tom Lopez.
Terrible tragedy. Did you know him well?
Not as well as I would have liked, no.
No, I suppose none of us did.
We always wish
we'd known someone better
when they're taken from us unexpectedly.
I lost my only son five years ago.
Drug overdose. I live with that every day.
It tests one's faith, doesn't it?
It can also help you find it.
- Are you a religious man, Doctor?
- MAN: Excuse me. Excuse me.
Yes and no.
Sign of the times.
The representative
from the mayor's office is here.
I hope we get a chance to work together.
It was a pleasure to meet you.
Pleasure meeting you, Mr. Calder.
- Bob.
- Bob.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
Would you like a cigar?
Oh, no, thanks. I'm trying to cut down.
- Smoke attracts the gods.
- It makes them want to join the party.
How about that?
I'm gonna go pee. I'll be right back.
CALDER: Did they show you a warrant?
OSCAR: Oh, yes, they did.
How could anybody think that
anybody connected with our organization
had something to do
with something so monstrous?
Well, clearly, Oscar, they made a mistake.
- Let the lawyers handle it.
- I tell you,
if all the good work we've done
is destroyed by this...
Oscar, that's not gonna happen,
you have my word on that.
What is the detective's name?
McTaggert.
Lieutenant McTaggert.
I don't want you to worry about this. Oscar.
MAN'. We are proud to present the chairman
of our board, Mr. Robert Calder.
CALDER'. Thank you. Thank you.
On behalf of the A.C.H.E. program,
I'm especially proud to say that
thanks to your generous contributions,
will be opening in Detroit, Los Angeles,
Miami and Washington, D.C.
- I have a check here for $50,000.
-
Wait a minute.
Don't worry, I'm good for it.
Now, our helpers will be
moving amongst you soon.
So, the next hand you feel in your pocket
may not be your own.
And remember, just remember,
it's still tax deductible.
Thank you.
What should we do?
Don't touch him! He's not one of us!
Go! Quickly. Go now!
What the hell are you doing? Stop it!
Stop it! Get away from him!
Get out!
Stay with him!
I warned you about this, Carmen.
Now you're fired! Get out!
But the child! You don't understand!
No, you don't understand! You're fired! Go!
He's in danger! I'm trying to protect him!
Protect him? The kid is hysterical
for Christ's sake. Get out!
-
- I don't want to hear!
- I don't wanna hear...
- Please, let me finish doing this!
You are finished! Now go!
- You don't know what you're doing!
- I know exactly what I'm doing!
-
-
My God, you're killing me!
No, no!
If I see you around here again,
I'm gonna call the police.
Is that clear enough?
MCTAGGERTI What's the matter
with you guys?
OFFICER: It won't happen again.
Come on, It won't happen again.
It happens all the time!
Do me a favor, will you? Keep the goddamn
greens on the desk and out of the box!
OFFICER: I'm sorry. Sure. Okay.
MCTAGGERT: "I'm sorry"!
You always say, "I'm sorry"!
For Christ's sake,
get your act together, huh?
Hey, Cal.
- How are you doing?
- Lieutenant? Is this a bad time?
It's always a bad time around here.
Let's go.
- What's up?
- What's in here.
Sezine's story on his son checks out.
Autopsy confirms the kid OD'd.
That's what I expected.
What about the Calder boy?
Same thing. Overdose five years ago.
Five years ago, this boy was 8 years old.
- Where's the autopsy report?
- I don't know. I... I can't find it.
Are you serious?
Nobody knows where it is.
Are you saying you lost it,
or somebody doesn't want it found?
Listen.
We're dropping this investigation now.
We're laying the murders off on Lopez.
Lopez didn't kill anybody but himself
and you know it.
Where is this coming from?
Lopez is dead. We got him tied to the kids.
He took his life out of his own guilt.
We got enough to close now!
Who the hell do you think you're kidding?
You want...
You want me to show you?
Come here.
You didn't see this.
- Sorry we're late.
- DENNIS: Oh, no problem.
We're all set now.
All right. All aboard.
There are plenty of good seats
still available. Tickets please.
I have my ticket.
Now listen, be a good boy.
I'll be out in a couple of days
and then we'll go to Santa Fe
to see grandma and grandpa, okay?
- I'm going to go sailing.
- Sailing?
I fully expect you to be captain of the ship,
Mr. Christopher.
I'll call tomorrow
and you'll tell me all about it.
I love you, Dad.
I love you, too, Bean.
Have a great time, kiddo.
- All ashore that's going ashore.
- Come along, matey, here we go!
Watch your feet.
- Don't you worry about anything.
- Thanks, Kate.
See you both Friday.
I have a glorious dinner planned.
- See you. Bye-bye.
- Bye, Dad. Bye.
CAL: Why would my housekeeper
take it from my son? Is it Santeria?
No, this is not Santeria.
This symbol belongs to a god
of destruction and pestilence,
What the hell does it
have to do with my son?
There was, uh,
a ritual
when a tribe was threatened by drought,
flood or destruction by its enemies.
Three children were offered to the god.
JESSICA: Sacrificed?
Elder sons sacrificed by their fathers.
- The last child, at summer solstice.
- JESSICA: Why?
To gain power, to destroy their enemies.
I've seen the bodies of two children.
This ritual is being performed now.
Was Carmen involved?
No, I believe she tried to cast a spell
of protection. She was not strong enough.
It was turned against her.
Protection from what?
Look. You both felt the power of the man
who killed Tom Lopez
and those two children. I'm sure of it.
You looked into his eyes.
Did Calder bring that man here?
I believe that's what Lopez
was trying to tell you.
What can I do? Please, tell me what I can do.
The summer solstice is on June 21st.
Four days away.
You must seek protection for your son
and for yourself.
And you must trust me and do as I say.
- Cal, we shouldn't be doing this.
- You don't have to stay.
- I think we should both leave, right now.
- CAL: No.
JESSICA: This doesn't feel right.
- Cal, please!
- I don't know what else to do.
OSCAR: Please kneel.
Water to purify.
May your enemies never see
what we are doing here.
Stand up.
Turn.
Offer the blood for your son's life.
- Oh, here's one.
- Another one?
Yeah. This kid comes running home
from school one day,
he's got a brown package
under his arm.
So he says to his mother, "Hey, Mom,
look what I found..."
-
- Hold on a second.
Detective Connolly. 2-7 squad.
CAL'. This is Dr. Jamison.
Lieutenant McTaggert, please.
No, I'm sorry, Doc. He's out sick today.
Guess the flu's making its rounds.
Hey.
Why don't you come with us?
I am.
No, I mean to Santa Fe, too.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
This could get serious, you know?
I hope so.
KATE: Hello?
CAL OVER PHONE: Kate, it's Cal.
- Oh, darling, how are you?
- I'm fine. How are you?
- I'm just great.
- How's the weather?
It's fabulous,
and the forecast is even better.
Oh, that's great. ls Chris
behaving himself all right?
He's a delight. I'd half forgotten about
eight year olds.
He's run me half ragged.
I know what you mean. I guess I'm
used to it. Can I talk to him, please?
Oh, I'm sorry, darling.
He's out in the boat with Dennis right now.
- But I'll give him a big hug.
- All right, please do that for me.
-will we see you here this evening?
- Yes, of course.
Oh, that's wonderful.
We have the whole weekend planned.
- Well, we're looking forward to it.
-All right. See you later, dear.
- Yeah, we'll see you later.
- Drive carefully.
- We will.
- Kisses.
'BYe~bye.
-Bye.
- JESSICA:  Yeah.
- Hey, you all right?
You don't sound okay.
I'm coming right over.
JESSICA: No, no, no. Really.
I just think I need, um, some more sleep.
Maybe I should call Kate and Dennis and
tell them we would be out in the morning.
- No, you go ahead.
-You sure?
Yes. Call me when you get there.
And give Chris my love, okay?
- Bye.
- B ye.
- Cal?
-
Cal?
Shit.
CAL:  I'm sorry
no one's here to take your call
- Hello.
-
- Who is this?
- McTAGGERT: It's McTaggen'.
- Lieutenant.
- My apartment. Got to see you.
- What is it? What's wrong?
- Just get over here! Do it!
- Wait a second.
-
MCTaggert?
Who is it?
It's me, Cal.
Shut the door.
Step into the light. I want to see your face.
What's going on? You don't need the gun.
Like hell I don't.
I saw them. They're out there.
No, there's nobody out there.
You goddamn liar!
No, Sean, I swear to you.
I came alone. I'm here to help you.
Open that.
What is it?
Calder's son.
It wasn't an overdose.
He killed his own fucking son.
Where did you get this?
Buried files.
They didn't think I knew
where to find them, but I did.
That's what they're
out there now, they're watching.
Go on.
You answer it.
Hello.
See? You believe me now?
Why haven't they done anything to you?
What have they done to you, Sean?
I can't move.
"Oh, my God, I am heartily sorry
"for having offended Thee.
"And I detest
BOTH: "All my sins
"because of Thy just punishments.
"But most of all because they offend Thee,
my God,
"who art all good,
and worthy of all my love.
"I firmly resolve..."
Everything's going to be all right now.
No.
Take the gun.
Kill him.
The police won't help you.
He'll get to anybody.
Do it yourself, please, I'm begging you.
Go.
Destroy Calder.
God help you.
"I firmly resolve,
"with the help of Thy grace,
to sin no more."
MARTY: Yeah, hello.
Marty, it's me, Cal.
Listen, I've got something very important
I want you to keep for me.
Jessica!
Marty, stay there. I'll call you right back!
Jessica.
Jessica.
Jessica.
Oh, my God.
- WOMAN: Vital signs?
- BP, 80 over 60. Pulse, 140.
Respiration, 30 and shallow.
Wait outside, please.
CAL: I'm sorry there's
no one here to take your call,
but if you leave your name and number,
I'll get back to you as soon as I can.
Oh, please, God, what have I done?
Cal, I'm bringing Chris.
Will explain all when I see you.
Meet me, Flanders Inn...
Hello? Hello?
CAL: Marty, make sure they take care of her
till I get back.
Look, I told everyone at the hospital
I'm a lawyer. What are they, idiots? Relax.
Get some sleep.
CAL:  Can you find your way back?
MARTY: No problem.
Hey. Keep this for me, will you?
DENNIS: The prodigal son returns!
- Forgive me, Dennis, I'm terribly sorry.
- Not a word of it. Come in.
Kate's gone to her all-night market.
She never seems to think
we have enough food out here.
- DENNIS: Last door on the end.
- Okay.
- Oh, thank you, Dennis.
- Not at all.
- Hell of a week for you, my friend.
- Been a hell of a year.
That's true. It is hell, isn't it?
There's no point in denying it.
The kind of loss you suffered,
that kind of grief, it's dreadful.
But what can you do? Be a man about it.
That's what you've done.
You just go on!
And then one day,
you wake up
and it's just the slightest bit better.
That's the way it changes, little by little,
small increments.
Well, that's the way it was with us.
We thought we'd never get over it.
But you do.
When was that?
Kate's fieldwork. Post-graduate.
Summer of '46.
The Sudan. 11 months in the bush.
Haven't I ever told you this story?
No.
Worst drought in 50 years.
Then cholera.
We saw half the tribe decimated.
Daniel was only four years old.
Oh, I'd argued against bringing him,
but Kate insisted.
She couldn't bear to leave him that long.
Then, when Daniel took sick,
the elders of the tribe came to see us.
We'd developed a trust with them by then.
A bond.
What they suggested seemed unthinkable,
against nature.
But you see, Cal,
Daniel
was so clearly beyond any medical help.
As outsiders, it was really a great honor.
Daniel was very brave.
And the drought did end, Cal.
We were delivered.
The life of another child was saved.
A most remarkable child, Cal.
Over the years, he's grown so special
to us, almost like a son.
He's taught us so much.
Of course, you're uncertain,
Cal, naturally. So was I until I met him.
Now imagine, if you can,
a life without uncertainty.
Freedom from doubt. The ability to choose.
Single-mindedness.
One life from each of us, Cal, is all he asks.
And he rewards our devotion
a thousand fold.
Personal desires?
Oh, yes, of course. Anything.
- That's part of it.
-It's only the beginning.
CALDER: There was a time, Cal, when man
was at one with the gods, before the Fall.
Now we're at one again
and their benediction is power.
It's a power you can't imagine.
Power to create a world of our choosing.
Power to destroy those who oppose us.
DENNIS: Chris was chosen, Cal.
When he found the shell, remember?
It was a sign.
Cal. Cal.
We want you to join us!
DENNIS: It must be the father.
DENNIS: "We consecrate this ground
"with this father's humble offering.
"We seek the strength and wisdom
"of our benefactors.
CALDER: "We call upon the ancient gods
to renew our strength.
"And guide your hand to strike down
the enemies of our faith and this nation.
"We welcome our brother, Cal,
"reborn into your grace.
ALL: "Restore nature's order.
ALL: "The power, which is our birthright.
ALL: "The glory, which is our destiny.
ALL: "Our enemies consumed
by rings of fire.
ALL: "Our strength reborn
"in sacrifice!"
Do you believe?
Yes, I do believe.
-
-
Chris!
CHRIS: Dad?
Dad.
"Peter, Peter, pumpkin eater,
had a wife and couldn't keep her."
- You okay?
- I'm all right! Where is he?
- Fucking maniacs! Who are these guys?
- Chris!
Theyjumped in the elevator.
They took him up.
CAL: Chris!
I'll take this one.
Chris!
- CHRIS: Dad!
- Chris!
- Let me go!
- Chris!
God damn. Chris!
Dad!
Chris?
Dad? Dad?
Chris!
Chris!
Chris!
God gave His only begotten son.
Let him go!
Remember that?
It is God's will
that innocence redeem the world.
Why we give our sons to war
in the name of peace.
Sacrifice our children, our families
to false gods, ambition, lust, pride!
- Dad.
- It's hypocrisy! This is all lies.
I was a slave, I had no life!
You have no life! God gives you life!
You give them innocence,
the gods give you life.
And your son was innocent, wasn't he?
Peter, that was your son's name, wasn't it?
And you sacrificed your son
to the gods, didn't you?
That was my salvation.
I was reborn.
It must have taken great strength
and great courage.
Tell me.
He looked into my eyes.
Dad?
He forgave me.
Peter.
He understood.
CALDER: No.
Chris?
I'm over here.
Come to me.
No.
You come to me.
Let's go, boy.
Hey, Bean, how's it going?
- Hey, Dad. Got the barbecue sauce?
- Sure do.
- Let's go easy on it this time.
- Oh.
Hey, don't you look beautiful.
- I'm glad you're home.
- Me, too.
- Be careful with that, Chris.
- All right, Mom.
CHRIS: Mom?
No, no. It'll keep.
-
- CHRIS: Mom?
Maybe it won't!
JESSICA: Hey, Chris, that looks terrific.
You don't need my help at all.
Don't burn yourself.
What is it, boy? What is it?
Easy, fella.
What's wrong, boy? What is it?
Anybody up there?
All right, out!
I did it for us.
We'll be safe now.
