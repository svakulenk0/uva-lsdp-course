... dead people...
... the recently departed...
Unburied human corpses
are returning to life...
and feeding on the living.
Stay inside.
Do not try
to leave your homes.
They seem to survive
by eating human flesh.
Everyone who dies
will become one of them.
If you are bitten, you will just become
one of them...
that much sooner.
They're not your neighbors
and friends, not anymore.
My wife had a heart attack.
Got up and came after me
like a banshee from hell.
I put a curling iron
through her head.
... the head...
... the brain...
They must be destroyed
as quickly as possible.
There's no time
for funeral arrangements.
There's no time
to dig up holes...
so you can drop these things
in the ground.
As long as we're alive...
they ain't never gonna
run out of food.
The day they do, it'll mean only one thing:
We're all dead.
This is not only a local
or a regional phenomenon.
Cities are under siege.
If these creatures ever
develop the power to think...
to reason...
even in the most
primitive way...
People are said
to be establishing...
outposts in big cities...
and raiding small rural towns
for supplies, like outlaws.
##
They're trying to be us.
No, they used to be us.
Learning how to be us again.
No way. Some germ or some devil
got those things up and walking...
but there's a big difference
between us and them.
They're dead.
It's like they're pretending
to be alive.
Isn't that what we're doing,
pretending to be alive?
He knows we're here.
Christ.
It's like he's
talking to them.
Let's go.
A whole lot of trash this
week. That's life, bro.
Whole lot of trash, trick
is not to get in with it.
You any good with that, kid? Because
I'm real good with mine.
Put it away, Charlie.
Don't be so jumpy, kid.
What are you doing?
Watching your back. I don't
like it when you go off without me.
I told you to get things
ready. I got things ready...
then I come
to watch your back.
Christ! This is like
a bad dream.
I have bad dreams.
Hell, yes. Just look at me, you
can tell I have terrible dreams.
Riley, what's your 20?
We checked out the town.
There's plenty of supplies, but
a lot of walkers. Where's Cholo?
He dumped the trash,
and he's on his way back.
We're ready to go in.
Okay.
Put some flowers
in the graveyard.
"Flowers in the graveyard."
Why do you call them that, Riley?
I don't get it.
These here flowers ain't
the kind you lay down on the ground.
These here are sky flowers,
way up in heaven.
That's why I love you, Charlie.
Because you still believe in heaven.
Lord, yeah.
I mean, look.
Nice driving.
Riley, looks like God's left
the phone off the hook, huh, baby?
Go get my ride.
Get yours, too.
What's the matter?
You look like shit, man.
Didn't I tell you
not to bang chicks...
with problems worse than you?
When are going to listen me?
You done?
I'm never done, baby. Why?
The town's full of walkers.
Yeah, but every town
is full of walkers.
No, these guys are not just walking.
It's like they're communicating.
They're thinking, and
there's something going on.
But they're dumb, Riley.
Well, hell. Dead folks
is near as dumb as me.
You learned to make yourself
useful, didn't you?
Yeah.
That's what they're doing.
Make yourself useful.
You don't got one
redeeming defect, do you, son, huh?
I got this! I got this! You
got that? You got that, too.
Come on. Let's get to work before
I forget what it is I do for a living.
Cholo, I'm talking to you.
All right, what?
Things are changing.
Just be careful.
We go in, we do our job...
and we get the fuck
out of there. Everyone alive.
Now, you take command of this unit,
you can run it any way you like.
But tonight, it's my last night
out. I don't want any fuck-ups.
So, that's what it's about?
You're not going to dump these
recycled delinquents on me.
I don't want to take command.
Because you know what? Tonight's
my last night, too, baby.
Hey, you. Come here,
you little nose-picker.
You been with Riley all day
painting the town beige?
I'm gonna show you
how it's done. Come on.
What'd he do,
win the lottery or something?
Something.
How come you guys
always go out at night?
Wouldn't it be safer
in the daytime?
Fireworks, kid. Stenches
can't keep their eyes off them.
Come on!
Yeah!
That sucker's mine, baby.
I got that one.
Number 1, how's the food?
Mostly canned stuff.
I'd stay away from the fish.
Number 2,
what's your location?
Drugstore.
Need an aspirin?
I got a million of them.
Antibiotics.
We need antibiotics.
They're gone.
The sky flowers, they're gone.
That's not good, is it?
No, it's not good.
Sorry, Riley,
I should have seen that thing.
Nice shooting.
That's good shooting, Charlie.
No such thing
as nice shooting.
Pretty Boy,
what the fuck is going on?
Fireworks are jammed.
We're getting on it.
Shut her down!
Everyone, out of town.
Let's move! Go! Drive!
Go!
Two minutes!
Pretty Boy,
lay down some cover.
Get on the guns!
I thought this was going to be a
battle. It's a fucking massacre.
Cholo, we got a problem.
Fireworks are down.
It's nice and peaceful,
ain't it? Cholo, where are you?
I'm just getting some
supplies, some essential supplies...
just like my job
description entails.
Nothing in there but booze.
Booze ain't essential.
A jug of good Kentucky
goes for $1,500 back in town.
You've got to
get out of there. Cholo?
God damn it!
All right, Foxy,
shop till you drop, baby.
You know it, brother.
Yeah, 'cause
getting them stinking drunk...
is the only way
you're gonna get laid.
When's the last
time you got laid? I forget.
Fox, I don't care about love.
All I care about is money.
That's all I want, baby.
Yes.
Foxy!
I can't
get a shot. Cholo, hold on.
I got him. Cholo, I got him!
Bro, do me a favor, will you?
Next time, just let me
take the fucking shot.
Fucking cowboy.
Stop being a pussy, man.
Yeah, I got what I need.
A little something extra, too.
Nice.
Here, kid, pick that up.
I'm bit.
Yeah, you're bit.
Not gonna leave you here.
Gonna get you out of here, okay?
No. I will not become
one of those things.
Riley, step aside.
No, you put that thing away.
Riley, come on. Step aside.
I said put it away.
This is Riley. Cease fire.
Repeat, cease fire.
Let's pack it up.
We're going to call it a night.
Shit happens, right?
Only if you let it, Charlie.
Life goes on
at Fiddler's Green...
in the heart of one of America's
oldest and greatest cities.
Bordered on three sides
by mighty rivers...
Fiddler's Green offers luxury living
in the grand old style.
Dine at one of
six fine restaurants.
Look for that perfect gift in our fully-stocked
shopping mall.
Man, they sure did
used to make it sound nice.
Still sounds nice to me.
There is a difference between
our place and other places.
If you can appreciate
that difference...
You're not
going to be around no more?
You little bitch, you can come up
and party with me any time you want.
I hate going under the river.
Cholo.
Shit. Let's
get out of here, Foxy.
Yeah, man. Back off, Riley.
Just back the fuck off
'cause I am not in the mood.
You think that kid was in the
mood? Look, he knew the risk, man.
He took the job like we all
took the job knowing the risk.
Exactly, the job. You know
what the job is, Cholo?
It's to bring things in
that people need.
Not to make a few extra bucks
selling liquor on the street.
What, you're talking
about this?
This is for me and my
new friends, to celebrate.
That's what that's for.
A kid died out there
on the street tonight...
so that you can
fucking celebrate.
Riley, you know what you remind
me of? You remind me of my old man.
A nice guy. I loved him and
all that but he was a dumbass.
Never went for anything,
so he never had anything.
What do you got, Riley? Nothing.
I'm going to have my own place, man.
My own goddamn place.
You're dreaming, Cholo.
They won't let you in there.
They wouldn't let me in there.
We're the wrong kind.
Yeah, well, we'll see.
Isn't it time?
Isn't it your time?
For Fiddler's Green?
DeMora, supplies unit.
What's in them boxes?
Essential supplies.
For Kaufman.
Mark your calendars.
Mr. Kaufman
cordially invites...
residents of the Green
to a masked ball...
on the eve of Allhallows.
It is strictly forbidden
to come as you are.
It's expensive. Look at that.
You like it?
I could tell.
Can I ask you to stop, sir?
Quitting time, Deke.
You're going to need this
to get back in.
When I said quitting time,
I meant quitting time.
Hey, baby.
"The only way to the Father,
is through me," sayeth the Lord.
So, Riley, you
want to go get a drink?
Just look at me. You can
tell I could use a drink.
You know, Charlie,
why don't you go ahead?
I'll catch up.
Where are you going?
I got to see a man
about a car.
A car?
All right.
Here's the deal.
Rivers protect us on two sides.
Bridges are all blocked up.
The only overland access
is here, called the "Throat."
And these fences
go all the way across?
Half a mile, both ways.
Stench. High noon.
Shit.
They don't
come around here much anymore.
It's like they've learned
they can't get in.
Take his fucking face off.
How long are you going
to let Kaufman push you around?
You like shining his shoes,
pressing his pants?
He didn't build that place.
He just took it over.
Kept the best for himself, and
left us with a slum to live in.
But if there's enough of us,
if all of you would join up...
we could make this
a fit place to live in.
Dad, look who's here.
Riley Denbo!
I used to work with him.
Bringing in toothpicks for the
bastards to pick at their gums.
And food and other stuff,
for all of us.
Come in with us, Riley.
Both of you.
Together we'd be unstoppable.
No one's unstoppable,
Mulligan.
You're worried about being
locked out. Now, you see that?
I can't help but think
we're all locked in.
I'm looking for
a world where there's no fences.
Here. Antibiotics for your boy. Thanks.
You all right, Son?
I'm fine, Dad.
Hey, easy, easy, Knipp! Easy.
Mr. DeMora. Mr. Kaufman
isn't home. And I heard...
That.
I called Security.
They should be here.
Yeah, I got it.
Where are you?
Oh, shit.
Oh, God, he killed himself.
All right, lady, I need you to
down, okay? Try to keep it together.
Who are you? Are you Security?
No, I'm not Security.
Then, who the hell are you?
I work for Kaufman. All right, lady,
I just need you to calm down, please.
What are you doing with that?
Lady, you know
what I have to do. I'm sorry.
Dad!
He's gonna turn, lady.
No, he won't. Please.
No, he's okay. Please,
we don't have a choice.
Don't make this anymore
difficult than it has to be.
He's gonna turn,
don't do this!
What's happening?
Shut up.
Hey, kid.
What the hell's going on here?
It's your problem.
Clean it up.
Hey, lady, it's okay.
What did you do to my car?
What car?
The last car I drove out of
this town was three years ago.
No, I bought a car.
It was right there yesterday.
There were two guys
working on it.
There was nobody here
this morning.
Son of a bitch.
What happened, Riley?
Did you get fucked?
Come with me.
You got fucked.
##
Roach.
Hey, how's it going?
I've been better.
Where's Chihuahua?
Around the back.
Come on!
Lot of action in here today.
We've got a new kind of game.
What are they betting on?
Black and red.
Who wins the fight.
Stenches don't fight.
They do when there's food.
What's on the menu,
cat or dog?
I told you,
today it's something new.
Who do you want, black
or red? $60 on black.
What the fuck happened
to my car?
They're fixing it up.
No, I went to the garage.
There's nothing there.
Your guys aren't there,
and my car is not there.
This is not me. I do not do this
to you. I'm your friend.
Well, be my friend
and get my fucking car back...
or I'll have to carry you
out of here inside that fucking hat.
This guy could
be trouble. Keep him busy.
Give a drink.
Let me have my gun.
Supply run last night, huh?
I heard you got some money.
Not interested.
I'll show you how to
turn that money into more...
I said I'm not interested.
Jesus! Fuck!
My suit.
He ruined my fucking suit!
Shit.
I'm all right.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I've seen you around.
I've seen you around, too,
working the streets.
You were checking me out?
What the hell happened here?
Someone shot the little
fat man. I see that.
You're under arrest.
Hey.
What?
Why you?
Why'd the little fat man
throw you in there with them things?
Wasn't the little man.
It was the big man.
Mr. K.
He's got his fingers
in everything here.
If you can drink it,
shoot it up...
fuck it, gamble on it,
it belongs to him.
Didn't answer the question.
He asked you why.
I know what he asked me.
They found out I was helping
out Mulligan and his people...
tired of eating bones
while he's having a steak.
Me, too,
but every place is the same.
Places with people.
I'm going to find a place
where there's no people.
North.
Canada.
If you get a way out...
I'm coming with you.
No, Riley likes to be alone.
He might take me,
'cause he says...
having me around is pretty
much the same as being alone.
And 'cause I can make
myself useful, and I can shoot.
I can shoot. I can be
pretty fucking useful.
I had training. I was going to
join the army, help the Green...
till somebody figured I'd
be a better hooker than a soldier.
You know, I don't want to hear
your fucking story.
Everyone's got a story,
and I am sick of hearing them.
What's your story, Riley?
I don't have one.
Nothing bad ever happened to
me till everything changed.
Everything changed
for all of us.
Hey, Mulligan.
What they going to do?
Kill him? Not right away.
First they'll try to get him
to talk. About people like me.
Mr. DeMora. Boss.
How was Uniontown?
Dead.
Death intrudes on us even here
in the city, I'm afraid.
I heard abut what happened
with my neighbors.
And I'm grateful
for your help.
That's what I'm here for,
boss...
to take care of any problems
you got.
Look, I got you a little present,
a little souvenir from town.
I know you're used to
better vintage than this...
but it's the best we got.
Little champers
to take the edge off things.
There we go.
This is very extravagant.
Yeah, well, I can afford it.
With the $20,000 you owe me
from last night...
and the money from all
the other nights together...
I got enough for my own place.
You mean here in the Green?
Sure, why not?
I'm sorry, Mr. DeMora...
but there's
a very long waiting list.
How long?
Well...
this is an extremely
desirable location.
Space is very limited.
You mean restricted,
don't you?
I do have
a board of directors...
and I have
a membership committee.
They have to approve.
Don't do this to me. Don't.
How long have I been working
for you? Three years?
Taking out your garbage,
cleaning up after you...
and then you're going to say
I'm not good enough?
Let me tell you something,
you're going to let me in...
because I know
what goes on around here.
Do your
committee members know...
what the fuck is going out
with the garbage?
So, you're gonna let me in,
you hear me?
Maybe we could talk about this when
you're a little less excited.
I won't be needing
this man anymore.
Take that, you scary zombie.
... come back to God.
Give up your lives of sin.
Praise the Lord!
Father is the only way.
Come back to Jesus.
Fox, get the guys.
We're going out.
Want me to call Riley? Forget
Riley. Just us. Come on.
Thanks.
Shit, man. You win. You
got him right in the brain.
That's right.
Double or nothing.
Brubaker, who'd you blow
to get this cushy job?
Cholo, you
bum, how's it going?
Where's Riley?
He's retired.
We're taking the truck out.
That's from yesterday.
What? You're shitting me.
I'm gonna quit drinking, man.
What the hell is that? Relax.
It's just target practice.
Barrett, stop scratching
around back there.
You're going to
fuck up my shot.
I'm not doing nothing, man,
I'm just standing here.
There's nothing there, man.
So, what the hell is that,
screaming practice?
Stenches!
They're all over the place.
Let's make our move. Come on.
All right, go.
Their eyes.
Mouse, take that.
Cholo, should we send up
some sky flowers?
It ain't our fight, Fox.
The stenches want to get in,
let them in. Come on.
Everybody, get busy.
That's our way out.
Should we do something about this?
That's our way out,
get us there.
No.
Get out of here!
No!
Kaufman.
The one that got away.
That's right.
Remember you said we should talk
when I was less excited?
I'm a lot less excited
right now.
What do you want, Mr. DeMora?
You might have noticed that
I had to leave in a hurry...
so I didn't get a chance
to take my money out of your bank.
I'd like you to handle
that withdrawal for me.
With interest: $5 million.
Or I'm gonna blow you
out of your fucking castle.
Because I got Dead Reckoning.
That's unfortunate.
Well, unfortunate for you,
perhaps.
I want you to put that money
on a boat...
and send it across the river to the South Side,
One man to drive the boat,
no more.
You have till midnight,
that's two and a half hours.
I won't be there, and Dead
Reckoning won't be there.
But I'll know if it happens, and
I'll know if it doesn't happen.
Copy?
Trouble?
In a world where the dead
are returning to life...
the world "trouble"
loses much of its meaning.
He wants money.
Pay him.
We don't negotiate
with terrorists.
We have other options.
Denbo. Give me Denbo.
Get up. You're coming with me.
Where you taking him?
Don't worry.
Where are you taking him?
You take care of him?
Hell, yeah.
He pulled me out of the fire.
It was bad.
Just look at me,
you can tell it was bad.
Mr. Denbo,
can I offer you a drink?
I don't drink.
Why am I here?
We want you to repossess a
vehicle that belongs to us...
a vehicle that you
designed, Mr. Denbo.
Dead Reckoning has been stolen
by your second-in-command...
who I want captured
or killed...
and I want my $2 million
piece of equipment returned.
My truck.
My truck, which has guns.
Powerful guns.
It'll do
a great deal of damage...
if they're aimed
at this city.
Why don't you just
send out your troops?
I can send 50 men
against that thing...
and they'd come back in
body bags. Now, Cholo was your man.
Maybe you can get close enough
to do what has to be done.
It's a good thing
I'm still in town.
See, I bought a car.
I was going to drive out
of here, but it disappeared.
I guess someone
didn't want me to leave.
You're a very popular man.
How much are your services
going to cost me?
A vehicle, enough weapons
and ammunition to go north.
But there's nothing up north.
That's the idea.
There's one more thing:
My friends, they go with me.
Take them.
Can you find Dead Reckoning,
quickly?
How quickly?
Midnight.
I have a way.
Mouse, there are three things
a man must do alone:
Be born, die, and we all know
the other one, don't we?
Yeah, okay, Cholo. Just don't
leave me here alone too long...
Two hours max. Give me a call. Let
me know if we're rich or not.
All right, two hours.
Give him something
for the nerves.
Something for the nerves.
Stay real. Okay.
##
Can't believe you guys are
turning me into a fucking boy scout.
Not a boy.
You don't have to come out
if you don't want to.
I didn't say that.
Some shit, though, going out
to save Kaufman's ass.
I'm not doing this
for Kaufman.
This is for the people
in the city.
What do you think's going to
happen to them if Cholo shells the Green?
Okay. I'm with you.
No, I like the ones
I already got.
This piece
fires 14 rounds a second.
I don't normally need
that many.
I don't normally
talk to retards.
Pretty easy to make fun
of some people, huh?
I could make
a whole lot of fun out of you.
I'll take this one.
He thinks
he's taking care of you.
He does.
Without his guns,
I'd be dead by now.
Without you,
he'd be dead by now.
Fair trade.
Riley, these guys are coming.
Gentlemen and lady.
Mr. Kaufman thought
you could use some support.
Don't need any.
Nevertheless. Manolete.
Manolete,
named after the bullfighter.
Monica.
You can call me Motown.
Pillsbury.
I'm here to do something.
Why are we standing around?
Let's do something.
We taking the jeep?
The Woody.
It's bigger, has guns.
Jeez. Cholo made a mess. No.
Cholo didn't do all this.
This is stenches.
A lot of them.
Maybe still here.
That's where they came in.
Look.
That's where they went out.
Trying to get to the city.
I'm going to go get the ammo.
Crank up the Woody, Charlie.
Make sure
she doesn't hurt herself.
I can take care of myself,
okay?
Fine. Charlie, make sure
she doesn't hurt anyone else.
You, come with me.
Walkers, Mr. Denbo?
And moving toward the city.
They'll never get across the river.
I wouldn't be so sure.
They learned
how to work together.
They're mindless
walking corpses...
and many of us
will be, too...
if you don't stay focused
on the task at hand.
Zombies, man.
They creep me out.
Do you really think they
can get across the water?
If you asked me that a week
ago, I would have said no.
But now...
One way or the other, we got to
get our hands on Dead Reckoning.
There's more of them
out there.
I can hear them.
They're always out there.
You're all right?
Yeah, no problem.
Woody's in there.
Who's got the keys, guys?
No keys to get. Melted.
Screw the keys. Let's just
hot-wire the fucking thing.
Yellow to red.
What the fuck does a Samoan know
about hot-wiring a fucking car?
Fifty thousand cars stolen
in Samoa every year.
Yeah? Well,
a million in Detroit.
Detroit's got 50 million cars.
Samoa: 50,000.
Every one stolen.
Charlie.
Why do you lick your rifle?
It catches the light.
What light?
How can you see anything?
Good eye.
Hey.
Charlie?
Shit!
Off-center, but I got him.
Awesome, man.
Got a flashlight?
Yeah.
Brubaker?
Hey, Brubaker?
Brubaker, you there?
Hear that?
Yeah.
All right, keep that thing
shining. Let's get ammo.
There's. 50 caliber
around here somewhere.
Great. Here's the. 50.
Jesus Christ.
No, not in here.
Think about where we are.
Take a breath.
Choose your shots.
We're even.
Not.
That hurt. I didn't hurt you.
I got it.
Oh, God.
Is he bit?
Yeah.
Go!
How long does he have?
Had a little brother bit. He took
less than an hour before he turned.
And then what happened?
I shot him.
You said nothing bad
ever happened to you.
That happened to my brother.
Yeah. Dead is dead.
And that ain't you or me.
I'm sorry.
No! No!
I recognize that
some of you are concerned...
and I wanna assure you...
that if anything goes wrong,
measures have been taken.
I've established outposts
with food and supplies...
that will support us
on our way.
On our way to where?
Anywhere that we want to go.
Alternative sites have been
chosen for us and our families...
as well as
necessary support personnel.
What about all the others?
All the others
can be replaced by others.
Boss.
You're interrupting me, Bill.
It's bad timing.
Just when I was talking about
how people can be replaced.
A day may come when you earn
yourself some responsibilities.
But right now
the responsibilities are mine.
They're all mine.
It was my ingenuity
that took an old world...
and made it
into something new.
I put up the fences
to make it safe.
I hired the soldiers
and paid for their training.
I kept the people off the streets
by giving them games and vices...
which cost me money.
But I spend it because
the responsibility is mine.
Now, do you understand the
meaning of the word responsibility?
We have to do
what we have to do.
Foxy, I know
I'm never gonna be great.
I'm never gonna be on the list
of names of people...
who done great things
because I don't do anything.
Not one thing.
If it wasn't for this truck,
I wouldn't be any different...
than that poor Mexican bastard
out there.
Cholo, look,
Kaufman might not pay.
Kaufman's gonna pay, man.
But if he doesn't, he knows
I'm gonna do a jihad on his ass.
When you hit
Route 6, take a right.
How do you know
which way to go?
Homing device.
Cool.
How long
since you been out here?
I've never been out.
I've lived in the city
since it was a real city.
Pull over.
Cover them, Charlie.
All right, you're working for
Kaufman, I'm working for Kaufman.
My job is to stop Cholo.
Your job is to bring the truck
back, with or without me, right?
Not without you, no.
Well, that means yes.
Here's what's going to happen.
I'm going to do my job.
You're not going to get to do yours.
Kaufman is never going to see
Dead Reckoning again.
And when I get it, I'm
gonna do what I want with it.
Anyone has any problems with
that, you can get out right here.
Some choice.
No choice. Close door.
Keep them covered,
Charlie.  Wait.
You made us come
all the way out here...
just to steal a fucking truck?
You made a deal, Riley.
You're going back on a deal.
You never done that before.
If Cholo shells the Green,
all deals are off.
If something worse happens,
I don't know about you...
but I don't want to be
out here in a car without a roof.
Mouse, you got anything?
No boat, no money, no nothing.
Load the six-packs.
##
Six-pack loaded.
All right, load the other six.
We're not gonna show them
any goddamn mercy.
I know where
Cholo's going. Where?
Mount Washington,
overlooks the city.
We can beat him there.
In that truck, he's
gotta take the main roads.
We can take the back streets. Right.
Make a right on Ivy, then
take a left on Westminster.
You wanna go up the hill?
Yes, I'm wanna go up the hill.
Let's go up the hill.
Almost midnight, sir.
Pack us up.
We might be leaving.
In the boat?
I'd rather be taking
Dead Reckoning...
but not available.
From this hillside,
they can shell the Green.
They're gonna be coming up
this road.
Pull in around the corner.
All right, they're coming.
You guys stay here
and keep real quiet.
I'm going to try
and talk my way inside.
He's going to steal that truck
and leave us here.
Riley would never do that.
Just look at him, you can
tell he'd never do that.
I like that man.
You, go help him.
Go.
Everything's okay back there.
It's too late
to send me back.
Now, put that thing away.
Put on your best Sunday smile,
and just try to look friendly.
I am friendly.
Hey, Cholo.
Take a look at this.
It's Denbo and his idiot.
All right. Stop the truck.
Come on, here.
So, how did you get up here?
In the Woody.
I tracked you with this.
Forgot to tell you...
the truck's got a
little transmitter in her belly.
You were always a smart guy.
Always a lot smarter
than me, man.
That's not saying much.
Open up.
What, are you fucking nuts?
Open up.
Hey, Charlie.
So, who's the smart one now?
Thought you would have quit...
but here you are still working for
the man, aren't you, Riley?
What? Kaufman sent you up
to take care of me?
Yeah.
Takes a true friend to stab you
right in the front, doesn't it?
That man pulls the trigger,
he's dead.
Who else is out there?
Kaufman sent some guys with
us. We took care of them.
Cover him.
Pretty Boy,
lock in the target.
We're running out of time.
I got you now.
You hit
that tower square on...
you're gonna kill
a lot of innocent people.
You miss, you hit the city, you're
gonna kill a lot of our friends.
Want to know
who killed our friends?
Kaufman is the one
that's killed our friends.
Every time I took out his garbage,
I took out one of our friends...
people he wanted
off the streets.
He turned me into a goon, then
he's gonna piss all over me?
I don't think so.
What are you gonna get
out of this, Cholo?
Hopefully my money.
Money burns.
Yeah, not if it's in a vault.
All right, Mr. K.,
won't be needing you anymore.
You set this right?
Yes.
Riley, you did something to it
with your fucking little toy.
This? What the fuck did you do? Fix it.
Fix it.
Not a fucking chance.
Cholo, look out.
Fuck.
You know, Riley...
there's something about you
that I've always really hated.
You're still here, aren't you?
What do you care?
You got what you wanted.
You're hit.
How you doing in there,
Charlie?
I'm being friendly.
What's in the bags?
Money.
Whose money?
Watch out. Get down. Quick.
Ours.
Yes?
We got Cholo.
Kaufman.
I'm here.
I just did something...
I might not have done
otherwise.
You lied to me, Denbo.
You didn't get DeMora.
He's shooting at us.
That's not Cholo, Mr. Kaufman.
Holy shit.
They got across the river.
Look at that.
I didn't even have to
blow the place up.
The fucking stenches
did it for me.
We're going back to the city
to see if we can help. Pick him up.
Where we going, man?
What are we doing?
Easy, Gargantua, come on.
Get him inside. Quick.
Not this horse.
Not this horse.
Take that Woody
if you still got it.
Fine.
You got me, too.
Thanks.
Anyone else?
Where you gonna go, Cholo?
There's always that outpost
in Cleveland.
Haven't heard from them
in a while.
Take my chances.
You have no right.
No right.
Woody's around the corner.
Guns and ammo inside.
Thanks.
Get us back on the main road.
You have blood, here.
We almost lost you there.
You all right?
Yeah.
You want to be really helpful,
roll me one.
Yeah, all right.
What was built to keep people
safe is gonna trap them inside.
This is Denbo
in the Reckoning.
Open up those fences
and let the people out.
The fences are still hot. We
can't cut the juice from here.
We've been trying to call
the power station.
There's no one
left over there.
We got to get the fuck
out of here.
There's no one left here,
either.
Move it.
We can rocket those fences.
Got to get across river.
The bridges into the
city, they're all bricked up.
Let's just fucking
blast our way through.
No, we can't do that.
There's a war going on over
there. We cross any of these bridges...
we're gonna end up
right in the middle of it.
We have to come in
outside of the Throat.
Somehow, Fox, I thought
we'd be traveling...
in a lot better style
than this, baby.
At least we're still
fucking traveling, brother.
What?
Come on, Fox, let's
get the hell out of here.
What?
Can you fucking believe it?
Nothing works out
the way you want it to.
There's something always comes
around the corner and just gets you.
It's your choice, bro.
I always wanted to see
how the other half lives.
The old J&L can take us over.
It's a drawbridge.
They leave it up.
That means it's not guarded.
Can you get us there?
Yeah.
Let's go.
I can stay with you,
if you want.
No. No.
This is between me
and the man.
Fox, she's all yours.
Hope you do better
than you did with me, man.
Yeah.
Holy shit!
A disturbance
has been reported...
on the outskirts of the city.
There's no reason
to believe...
that Fiddler's Green
could ever be compromised.
But we suggest that residents report any sightings
of unusual behavior.
There it is. Let's hope
it's still wired into the grid.
Shut the hatch, just in case.
When I get the bridge down,
you come pick me up.
How do you work this thing?
It's just like a video game.
What the fuck are you doing?
Making myself useful.
Wait. Wait. Stop. Stop!
Stenches.
Starboard.
They're behind us, too.
I can't get a shot.
Now shoot!
They'll never get in here.
Neither will Riley.
Unlock the
roof hatch, Pretty Boy.
Oh, shit.
Riley, go for the roof.
Okay.
Roll!
What are you doing? Forward!
I'm gonna
shake these bastards.
Get out of the way.
Hello?
Hello?
What is it?
Is something going on?
Stenches!
We're fucked.
Angle the mortars
for the Throat...
and send up some sky flowers.
Got her!
Oh, thank God.
Watch it now.
Oh, my God.
Downstairs. The car.
You bastards!
You have no right!
Mr. Kaufman, come on,
let's go.
Mr. Kaufman
wants you to know...
All right,
we're going to the boat.
... he has dedicated himself
to your well-being.
Be careful
when you open that door.
Should I call the crew, sir?
No, I'll call them.
God damn it.
What the fuck?
Goodbye, Mr. K.
Come back here, you son of a
bitch. You got the fucking keys.
Fucking spic bastard.
Nah. You're dead.
Oh, my God. You are dead.
Number 1's clear.
Going for Number 2.
I don't normally need
that many.
Don't bother. Come on down.
Blow the fences.
Sky flowers
don't work no more.
Shoot.
But there's people.
Those people are all dead.
Shoot, Charlie.
We're too late.
No.
Look.
You saved them.
You staying or leaving?
You?
Leaving.
Unless you need my help.
No.
Why don't you stick around?
We could turn this place into
what we always wanted it to be.
Maybe.
Then what will we turn into?
We'll see, won't we?
You want to go
to Canada now, Riley?
Sure, if no one
has any objections.
No, we'll take you with us.
I'll try to make myself
useful.
Anchor, load the guns.
We're hitting the road.
Now we can go.
No.
They're just looking
for a place to go.
Same as us.
Fire off what's left inside
those tubes.
We're not gonna need it
anymore.
Take us north.
