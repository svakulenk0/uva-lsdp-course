Help! Someone help me!
Is someone there?
Hey!
Oh, shit, I'm probably dead.
MAN:
- Who's that?
Who's that?
Turn on the lights!
What the fuck is going on? Where am I?
-
- What is that smell?
Holy shit.
Aaaargh! Help!
Help!
Help!
No-one can hear you.
What the fuck is this?
- Calm down. Just calm down.
-
Are you hurt?
I don't know. Yeah!
- What's your name?
- My name is Very Fucking Confused.
What's  name? What's going on here?
My name is Lawrence Gordon, I'm a doctor.
I just woke up here, like you.
Aaaargh!
No.
Do you have any idea how you got here?
No.
- What's the last thing you remember?
- Nothing.
I went to bed in my shit-hole apartment,
and woke up in an actual shit-hole.
What about you, huh?
There's... There's not much to tell.
I don't remember anything else.
First dead body I've ever seen.
They don't move.
From the looks of these chains,
someone didn't want  to go very far, either.
- Can you see any scars?
- What?
Man, they kidnap you and drug you.
Before you know, you're in a bath
and your kidneys are on eBay.
No-one has taken your kidneys.
How can you tell from way over there?
You'd either be in terrible agony,
or you'd be dead by now.
Trust me.
- What are you, a surgeon?
-
So...
Are you gonna tell me
your name, or what?
Adam.
Well, Adam...
What we need to do...
is start thinking about why we're here.
They must want something from us.
The question is, what?
-
-
- It's brand-new.
- So?
So...somebody obviously
wanted us to know the time.
What is that?
Excuse me.
It's a tape.
- Where did you find it?
- It was in my pocket.
Come on. Come on.
Fuck.
No?
- Use your shirt.
- What?
- It won't work.
- Look around.
There must be something else you can use.
- There's nothing.
- Well, there must be something.
Come on. Come on.
SINISTER VOICE:
I don't get it.
Throw me the player.
No. You throw me your tape.
Look, we're gonna have to work together,
if we want to get out of here.
-
- I'm not gonna risk breaking it.
SINISTER VOICE:
Give me that.
Now.
- Any idea who that is?
-
- He knows us.
- Wait a minute.
What do you think? Probably a joke, right?
Shh!
-
- Listen. Listen.
There, right next to you, on the toilet.
Come on. Come on.
Oh, man!
- Anything?
- No solids.
Take off the lid.
I really wish I had've checked in there first.
Huh! What is it?
Hey.
Mind passing me the other one?
Fuck! Fuck!
He doesn't want us to cut through our chains.
He wants us to cut through our feet.
I think I may know who's done this to us.
What did you say?
Well, it's not someone I know personally.
It's just someone I know of.
Last I heard...
..the police still hadn't caught him.
This one's not fresh any more.
At least three weeks out.
He started at the back and tunneled
through that razor wire so fast,
it's amazing he got as far as he did.
We also found this.
SINISTER VOICE:
Door was on a timer.
It was unlocked until three o'clock.
Then it slammed shut. He was given two hours.
You sick fuck!
I think we're gonna be here for a while, Sing.
LAWRENCE:
Actually, technically speaking,
he's...not really a murderer.
He never killed anyone.
SINISTER VOICE ON TAPE:
Help!
Aaaargh!
I found something else.
Well, two things, actually.
There was someone standing outside,
watching through this hole.
Our friend Jigsaw likes to book himself
front-row seats to his own sick little games.
Only, this time...he left us his penlight.
Hm...
Get a rush on the prints.
Copy that.
This patient has an inoperable frontal lobe
tumor extending across the midline.
It started as colon cancer.
The patient has come in for a standard checkup,
by which we can monitor the rate
at which his condition is declining.
- The patient had...
- His name is John.
Dr. Gordon. He's a very interesting person.
Thank you for that information, Zep.
TANNOY:
Someone doesn't want me to tell you
what the patient had! Excuse me.
Dr. Gordon.
I'm Detective Tapp, this is Detective Sing.
City homicide.
- Very impressive.
- Oh, thank you.
I do my best.
- Sorry to interrupt you while you work.
-
Now, how can I help you gentlemen?
Are you able to tell us where you were
between the hours of 11 PM and 1 AM last night?
Why is it that you're interested?
We'd like to ask a few questions about it.
For your sake, I think it's best
if we do it down at the station.
- Would you like to follow us there?
- I'm afraid that's out of the question.
I can't just leave, I have work to do.
Plus my wife has the car today.
That's OK. You can ride with us.
Doc?
I'm sorry.
You'll have to tell me again.
What is this all about?
Is this yours, Doctor?
Of course not, Brett.
Well, I have to ask.
What  you doing last night?
I was seeing someone.
Who?
Look, if you can't be honest with me...
I was visiting someone, It wasn't a patient.
What am I gonna do?
Well, as your lawyer and your friend,
my advice to you is to bite the bullet
and give them your alibi now,
That was five months ago.
He tried to set me up for murder.
OK.
We checked your alibi, It holds up.
Good. Can I go home now?
We have one of the victims
who managed to escape.
Want to know if you wouldn't mind sticking
around and listening to her testimony.
Maybe it'll trigger something.
- I'd like to help, really, but...
- Well, we'd appreciate it.
- She's the only one who made it.
- OK.
Amanda...
In your own time...
tell me the first thing you remember.
AMANDA:
SINISTER VOICE:
No!
And then I saw the body.
There was a knife.
You mean...he was alive?
Was.
What happened after you took it off?
SINISTER VOICE:
Most people are so ungrateful to be alive.
But not you. Not any more.
You are, in fact, a drug addict.
Isn't that right, Mandy?
Do you think that is why he picked you?
He...helped me.
Are you sure it's him?
- Yeah, I'm sure.
-
You could be the one who  me in this room!
I'm in exactly the same situation you're in.
Wrong. Wrong! You've got one thing I don't.
Information. You know who did this.
Now, you either tell me what is really going on,
or I'll cut you with this!
I'll cu...
- What?
- It's a two-way mirror.
MAN: I can see you.
MAN: Don't look at me, I can't help you.
Can you hear me in there? Huh?
I'm having a blast.
This is the most fun I've had without lubricant.
Make sure you're getting everything.
That's not gonna do anything.
-
-
That's why we can't cut through these chains
or why you won't break that glass.
Every possible angle
has been pre-thought out by him.
You make it sound like you admire this prick.
To overcome something, you have to
understand what a perfect engine it is.
That X has to be somewhere in this room.
Help me find it.
How can you be the calm doctor when
your wife and kid are out there?
-
- I  thinking about that.
I've been thinking about
the last thing I said to my daughter.
Diana, honey, are you OK?
Diana, honey, can you hear me?
- Mommy...
- What is it, sweet pea?
There's a man in my room.
Oh, honey, are you sure he's not
just hiding in your imagination?
He talked to me.
OK, I'll come and check your room.
I want Daddy. He'll get the scary man.
All right, if you want. Come on.
Larry, sorry to bother you,
but your daughter had a bad dream again.
Just a minute.
She wants you to check her room.
Mm-hm. Just got to finish this paragraph.
Come on, sweetie, I'll check with you.
Nope, I'm done.
See? There's no-one in your room.
There's no such thing as the Bad Man.
- Now can you go to sleep?
-
You are? Give me your tootsie.
Oh, what a big tootsie.
Remember this one?
This little piggy went to market.
This little piggy stayed home.
This little piggy had roast beef.
This little piggy had none.
This little piggy ran...
Whee! All the way home!
I hate that thing.
Well, I have to go to work, sweetheart.
You know what Daddy's job is like.
Now, come on.
Let's see.
Try and get some sleep, now, OK?
You're not gonna leave us, are you, Daddy?
What?
What are you talking about?
You mean, leave you and Mommy?
No. No, sweetheart, I...
I would never do that.
- Who gave you that idea?
- No-one.
Well, it's not true. OK?
-
- How much do I love you?
- Love you very much.
- That's right. That's right.
- Good night, sweetie.
- Good night, Daddy.
Tomorrow...I'll read you your favorite story.
OK.
ALISON:
- What are you talking about?
- How can you pretend you're happy?
- I am happy.
- That is complete bullshit.
ALISON:
Would you like to see her?
- She's beautiful.
-
You gonna have any more kids?
Ah, we've...talked about it, but er...
..with our schedules,
it's difficult enough to concentrate on one.
So, where's the lucky wife?
There's another picture
behind the one you're looking at.
Someone, usually me, has to hold the camera,
It's er... It's not here.
What?
This photo you're talking about's not here.
Really? Are you sure?
Yeah. Just...
Why, he... he must have taken it, I...
ALISON:
- I am happy.
- That is complete bullshit.
I'd rather you just tell me you hate me.
At least there would be some passion in it.
We'll talk about this later. OK?
Just leave.
MAN:
Diana?
Diana?
Diana!
ALISON: Shh.
Don't you dare!
Get away from her!
Mommy!
Mommy!
Mommy! Mommy!
Get your fucking hands off my daughter!
Get off of her!
Huh!
I never should have let you go.
WOMAN:
SINISTER VOICE:
TAPP:
SINISTER VOICE:
- We checked your alibi, it holds up.
- Isn't that right?
TAPP:
Here we are.
That was er...
quite an amazing story that poor woman told.
Look, I'm...
I'm sorry I can't be of more help
to your investigation.
You know, we arrested a dentist last week.
He liked to play with kids a bit too much.
He lived two blocks from here.
The sewer lines run under  neighborhood,
too...Doctor.
SINISTER VOICE:
- I'll catch you guys down there.
-
- Hey, Tapp.
- Hmm?
We're gonna go down to get a beer.
You want to come?
I don't think so. But thanks, anyway.
Well, you know, I always ask.
-
- Have fun.
Hey, Tapp.
I don't mean for this to be disrespectful.
Maybe you should find yourself a girlfriend.
Wait, wait, wait. Sing.
- Get back here.
- What?
What?
Remember 118th Street?
Er...K2K. That gang's territory
was only about four blocks.
Now, listen to this.
Check the records for all fire emergencies
in that area within the last two weeks.
Mmm!
On Tuesday 17th, a fire alarm went off
in the rear wing of 213 Stygian Street.
It's an old listing.
Used to be a mannequin factory.
Think we have enough for a warrant, though?
Who said anything about a warrant?
Right now?
Why not?
Yeah, why not?
TAPP: At least we'll have the cover of darkness.
SING: Yeah, well, so will anybody else.
I got you.
What the hell is this?
Shit.
-
SING: Oh, fuck!
Wait, Sing. Let's see what he's gonna do.
- Why? We fuckin' got him.
- We don't know what he looks like.
- Let's see what he's gonna do.
- No fucking way.
Fuck that, I'm gonna take him.
What the fuck? Shit!
-
MAN: Awake already, Jeff?
I need more-powerful tranquillizers next time.
Don't cry, I've given your life a purpose.
You're a test subject
for something greater than yourself.
Freeze!
- Hold it right there!
- Put your hands in the air!
MAN: Now you'll make a choice.
In 20 seconds, the life of this man will be ended.
- Get down here!
- Turn it off!
Fine.
Move!
- How do you turn it off?
- Tell him, asshole!
MAN: One key will unlock it.
- Where is it?
- It's in the box.
- Box?
Fuck!
- Which key? Which key?
- Tell him which key it is!
- Time's running out.
- Shut up and get down here!
What's more important to you, Officer?
Arresting me or the life of a human being?
Get down on your knees, asshole!
Hands behind your head!
- Tapp!
- Sick bastard!
- Yes, I'm sick, Officer.
- Tapp, there's a hundred keys here!
Sick from the disease eating away at me inside.
Sick of people
who don't appreciate their blessings.
Sick of those who scoff at the suffering of others.
I'm sick of 'em all!
Tapp!
No! No! Tapp! Tapp!
Shit! You're OK. Let me see.
I'll be back, I'm gonna be back, OK? I'll be back.
Freeze, or I'll shoot!
I had you.
I had you on your knees.
But you're running. You're running.
You're running scared cos...
cos we had you.
We're gonna close this case.
Gonna close it. Right, Sing? Right?
We're gonna close it, Sing.
LAWRENCE:
Just because I'm stuck in this room with you
I really don't see the point
in us not helping one another.
That's exactly why we need to talk and think.
- I am thinking!
- Then don't keep me in the dark
Turn off the lights.
Turn them off now, please.
- Why?
- Just turn them off for a second.
Jesus. Behind you.
LAWRENCE:
How come we didn't see that before?
The lights in here hadn't charged it.
It's glow-in-the-dark paint or something.
- Open it!
- It's locked.
The key... the one from my envelope.
Where is it?
Where the fuck? Here.
A cellphone.
Give me that.
Yes, I'm willing to risk it.
SINISTER VOICE:
May I please have a cigarette?
I'm trying the police.
- Shit.
This was meant to receive calls, not make them.
This has happened before.
Great.
That...thing...was waiting for me.
How did you know to turn off the lights?
- Who cares? It worked.
- Yeah, but how did you know?
Instinct.
Instinct?
- Yeah.
-
You're a terrible liar.
You say that like you know me.
What else aren't you telling me?
Well, um, let's see...
On my sixth birthday, my best friend at the time,
Scott Tibbs,
My last girlfriend, a feminist vegan punk,
broke up with me because  was too angry.
- One of my toenails is slightly...
- Just stop it!
You knew to turn off these lights.
- Whatever.
- I'm dealing with a juvenile.
- You wanna know?
- Yeah!
Here it is.
Come.
Oh, God.
W-Where did you get this?
It was in your wallet.
- Why didn't you show me this before?
- I couldn't.
I'm sorry.
What are you doing to them, you bastard?
OK. OK.
OK, I've got to think now.
Hey, what the hell are you doing?
LAWRENCE:
LAWRENCE:
So, you er... You still want that cigarette?
Um...yeah.
Sure.
There! I've done it!
Now where's my family?
Where are they?
Aaaargh!
- Aagh! Jesus Christ!
- What are you...?
I-I-I just got electrocuted!
What?
Jesus. That was our way out!
Did you hear what I said? Get this thing off me!
-
- Stop acting!
You think I would make that up just to mess up
your stupid fucking charade?
Damn it!
I remember everything now.
I remember how I got here.
Oh...
Great.
Is someone there?
I can hear you.
- Huh!
What the...?
What the Christ...?
What the...?
-
- Huh!
Who is that?
- Who's in there?
Come out!
I'll kill you, you motherfucker!
Aagh!
Who is this?
DIANA:
Diana.
Daddy, is that you?
Yeah, baby, it's me, I'm here.
I-I'm scared, Daddy.
Don't worry, honey. Everything's gonna be OK.
-
- She's here with me.
Let me talk to her, sweetie.
OK? Put Mommy on.
The bad man from my room is here.
And he has a gun.
Wh-What man?
Hello?
Hello?
Diana?
Diana!
Larry.
Ali? Is that you?
Is Adam there?
Ali...
What is going on?
Don't believe Adam's lies.
Hello? Ali?
Ali?
Hello!
Goddamn you!
If you so much as lay a finger on them,
I'll kill you.
You hear me, you son of a bitch? I'll kill you!
Damn!
Are they OK?
My wife, she er... She mentioned your name.
What did she say?
She told me...
not to believe you.
Believe me about what?
She told me you knew me.
Who are you?
You know who I am.
Stop the lies! You're a liar!
I need to know the truth!
I'm a liar?
What did you do last night, Lawrence?
You told me
that after you left your house last night,
- That's because it's the truth.
-
Your wife is right, Larry.
I can prove that you didn't go anywhere near
a hospital last night.
It's not the first time I've done it either, Larry.
- Why?
-
I get paid to take pictures of rich guys like you,
who go to seedy motels to fuck their secretaries.
You've er...had these with you the whole time?
I found them in there with the hacksaws.
- Right! You're so full of it!
- Face it, Larry, we're both bullshitters!
It only shows you what's put right in front of it.
Just out of curiosity,
what did you do in that motel room?
Why did you um...
deem it necessary to page me
when you knew I was at home?
I didn't know if you were going to make it.
I gave you a precise time at which to page me.
You can't do that.
It's not like I know the rules for this sort of stuff.
- What's wrong, Dr. Gordon?
- Look, um...
It was wrong of me to make you come here.
- But I thought we've...
- No, no. Please.
I'm sorry.
You tell anyone you were here?
No.
Hello.
- It's for you.
- For me?
Hello.
MAN:
- I...
I have to go.
- What happened?
- I gotta go.
-
Who was it?
Who was what?
The person who paid you to follow me.
Who was it?
He calls himself Bob and he gives me
the money upfront. 200 bucks a night.
If I'd known I'd end up here,
I'd have asked for a lot more.
What does that mean?
Does that mean you saw what happened to me?
What I saw was you get into your car. That's it.
I don't know how I got here.
I don't know how you got here.
Next thing I know, I'm chained to a pipe
in some prehistoric bathroom, staring at
the guy I've been taking shots of.
Clearly, whoever paid you to take pictures of me
is the one who put us here.
Maybe.
Of course it is! What did he look like?
-
- Was he tall? Skinny? Obese?
- I don't take notes.
- You must remember something about him.
- I can't.
- You don't remember a thing about the guy?
- I told you, I...
- For fuck's sake! I give up!
He's a tall black guy.
He's got a scar around his neck, OK?
Tapp.
- Detective Tapp.
-
The guy who paid me to take these photos
was  a cop.
No, no. He was discharged from the police force.
He broke down after his partner was killed.
He's convinced I must have somehow
been involved with the murders.
He's crazy. And you helped him.
You took money from him to invade my privacy.
How could you do that?
- Call it my need to eat.
-
Right. You know what, Adam,
you're not a victim of this game.
- You're part of it.
-
This cop thinks you're the one behind it all.
I told you, he's not a cop.
He's a bottom feeder, just like you!
What are you pissed off about?
The fact I took shots of you
or the fact that I took shots of you
while you cheated on your wife?
- I did not cheat on her!
-
I don't give a crap if you covered yourself in
peanut butter and had a 15-hooker gangbang.
How did I get here? I had...
I had everything in order.
My whole life was in perfect order.
Sweetheart, are you OK?
Mommy just needs you to be
really, really, really, really strong right now.
I'm not gonna let anybody hurt you.
OK. That's my good girl.
ADAM:
-
-
I know him.
- Zep.
-
His name is Zep. He's an orderly at my hospital.
Zep.
I'm gonna take great pleasure
in seeing you pay for this,
Look.
We're out of time.
-
- Shh, sweetie...sweetie.
- Mommy, help me!
- Ssh...
Dr. Gordon's time is up.
Now I've got to do what I've got to do, and...
..I'm afraid it has to be you
that tells him he failed.
Is that you, Zep, you bastard?
I know it's you, you son of a bitch!
ALISON:
Ali?
You failed.
Hello?
Hello?
- You!
- Wait.
Don't move! Stay on the ground.
Give me... Give me the phone.
Give it to me!
Larry?
Ali! Honey, are you all right?
No... No, we're not. Get down!
- Larry, where are you?
- I don't know.
I'm being held captive in a room somewhere.
Wh-What are you talking about?
-
- Honey, we need you here.
Forgive me, I've always been happy with you.
Mommy!
- Aagh!
-
Jesus!
Ali!
Ali! Ali!
Mommy!
Aargh! Aaargh!
Freeze!
-
- What the fuck?
- Yaaaa!
- Ya!
Argh! Urgh!
Mrs. Gordon?
Diana!
I'm gonna kill your husband now, Mrs. Gordon.
Lawrence!
Lawrence, get up!
Lawrence! Get up!
Oh, thank God, I thought you were dead.
He...He... He electrocuted me.
I told you.
The same thing happened to me. See?
Fuck this shit!
-
-
No!
Lawrence, calm down.
- There must be a way out of this.
- Shut up!
Just shut up! My family needs me!
No! God!
God! No!
Argh!
Lawrence! I have a family too.
I don't see them, that's my mistake.
It's a mistake I'd like to fix.
I'm gonna kill you, you sick asshole.
Stop it.
There's a way out of here.
There's a way out!
Lawrence!
No! What are you... No!
Oh, my God! Lawrence!
What are you doing?
What...are you doing?
What are you... What are you...
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Lawrence! It's not me who did this to you!
- You have to die.
- No! I want to live!
- I'm sorry.
- I want to live!
- My family...
- Argh!
There! I've done it!
Now show them to me!
Show them to me.
- Thank you very much, Officer.
- Larry?
Did you get through to him?
- There's still no answer.
- I've called the police.
Everything is OK.
I'll fucking kill you! I'll fucking kill you!
You fucking bastard!
I'll fucking kill you!
You fucking bastard!
- I'll fucking kill you!
I'll fucking kill you.
- Why?
- It's the rules.
Argh!
You're gonna be all right.
You're just wounded... wounded in the shoulder.
I have to go and get help.
Don't leave me!
No!
No! No!
No! Ow!
D-Don't worry.
I promise.
Key.
Key. Key!
SINISTER VOICE:
Dr. Gordon's time is up.
Mrs. Gordon!
- Why?
- It's the rules.
The key to that chain is in the bathtub.
He's a very interesting person.
His name is John.
He has an inoperable frontal-lobe tumor.
-
- Sounds like Jigsaw.
He books himself front-row seats
to his own sicko games.
Game over.
Argh! Argh!
Don't! Don't!
Don't! Argh!
