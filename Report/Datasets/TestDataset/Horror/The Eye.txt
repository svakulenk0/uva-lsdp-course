Oh shit,thanks.
Ý didn't see that
Me neither.
People say, "seeing is believing"
But for me that's not entirely true.
I lost my sight when I was 5 years old.
those memories of what I have seen...
had.... so much that i doubted even recognise
myself anymore.
Now I see using my other senses.
I can smell the rain before it drops.
But I can not watch it fall
I can feel the sun on my face.
But I can not see a rise or set
I want to see the world like everyone else.
to see the sun, rain and music.
I bet that the music looks beautiful.
Thank you.
Happy Birthday.

Everything is just perfect.
You're recovering quite nicely.
And the tearing is stopped.
-I think so, yeah.
-Good.
-So, whose eyes were this?
-Excuse me?
My donor?
I'm afraid i can't help you
with that Sydney.These are your eyes now
and they're working.
I shouldn't matter where it came from.
It hurts?
Yes , a little.
When will i be able to see clearly?
Varies with each patient,
A couple of days or weeks.
But your vision itself isn't the issue,
Because you were blind so long
so i'm going to refer you a specialist.
Paul Faulkner, he'll help you.
-You all right?
-Yeah.
-Have a nice day tomorrow.
-Thanks, Sydney.
-Hi.
-Hey.
Are you ready to be my tour guide?
Are you leaving?
Yeah,i'm afraid they have had enough for me here.
This is my sister Hellen.Hellen, this is Alicia.
Hi.
-Can we get a picture together?
-Of course.
-I'll do it.
-Okay.
I know your are scared, Sydney.
Don't be.
The world is really beautiful.

Hi, Cynthia.
How could i not, Cynthia.
-Richard, hi.

So, this is how bold looks like.
-Hey, Sydney. How are you?
-Miguel, how are you?
You look good.
Hello honey.
-How are you feeling?
-Take a breath.
Hi, how are you?
Are you okay?
Do you need some water or anything?
Yeah,i'm gonna got to the kitchen.
Why don't you stay with the guests?
Thank you for coming.
-Hi.
-Hi.
Sorry, i'm late.
That's Henry.
-I'm Paul.
-Sydney.
Have a seat?
You've damaged your cornea,
when you were five.
Yeah, my sister and i were
playing with firecrackers.
I tried a transplant,when i was 12.
But i rejected them
-Ayrýntýlý araþtýrma.
Have you tried again?
No, my sister was really the one
who kept up with all that stuff.
These are Dr. Haskin's test results.
There's nothing physically wrong with you.
Opeartion went flawlessly.
-but you were probably... for a shock
-Why?
You've already felt the information
from sound, smell and touch.
But now,you're gonna be assaulted by a
million things you never even knew existed.
That is an all
new level of confusion.
Do i look here, here,is that bright thing important,
is dark one moving toward me or away from me...
...dangerous or not?
As long as your eyes are open,
there are just too many distractions,
I mean, how do you consantrate?
I'm talking to you...
...and you're looking at that one and
you're thinking if you're gonna eat that.
They are pineapple,by the way.
You cut it open.
I like pineapple.
Sorry.
Anyway,because you can see, people are gonna
expect you to deal things that you can't do
...read signs,recognise body language, people's
gestures and facial expressions...
and they just get out of their way.
Your wyws will wanna dominate...
...how you perceive the world,
but you can't fully trust them, not yet.
And the next few weeks, i gonna help
you to see the world like it really is, okay.
Some of is gonna be wonderful, a lot of is gonna be...
...difficul but the main thing
is to be prepared.
And that's where i come in.
We're in this together.
You scared me.
Have you seen my report card?
Your report card?
-Do you live here,sweetie?
-My father will be so mad at me.
Have you seen my report card?
Sorry.
Let's take five.
I'm sorry, I don't know what's
wrong with me?
Relax.
You're pushing too hard.
You know, when i first went to London
to work with the Filarmonica...
...i was so nervous.
In Prag, i was a big fish, in London
one of the hundreds.
But you did very well in London.
I never thought i would be ready,
but when it was time to go on...
...everything faded away,
it was just me.
When there was nothing
to worry about.
Will you be ready?
We're all counting on you.
-I'll be ready.
-I'm sure you will be.
-22.
-22? That's us.
-You seat, i'll take it.
-Thank you.
Did you think i'm just
gonna let you to go?
You think i'm not gonna do something?
That's right?
-I'm gonna do it.
-I'm sorry.
I told you i was gonna do it.
I'm gonna do it.
What happened?
There was a woman,
she came in me.
What woman?
What woman?
Christ,Sydney you gotta hold off
yourself, please.
Sorry.
Sorry.
I apologize.
It's allright.
Well.
For the latest results,there is
nothing wrong with your eyes.
Maybe there is something
wrong with the tests.
Test only gaves us the fact that you gave...
normal responses
Creative ones yeah, like a kinda artist andmusicians give
But last i've checked
you're a musician.
I'm sure other musicians don't
see what i'm gonna see.
Come with me.
I'm not an idiot.
I understand what you're telling me.
My brain's having a real learn...
...how to decode the world around it.
But that's very different for me seeing ...
...things that don't
seem to be real.
Look, you're real.
You're here.
My perspective and focus is off,but...
...you're real
I can see you.
We'll see what we look at.
But the way that...
...we see things is
affected by what we know.
...and there is a lot around that it
can't make sense of you.
What are you saying to me?
You think i'm making this up?
You think i want this to be happening to me?
You think you're not gonna be able
to push through this.You think you were better before.
More special.
You have just discovered that
you are like the rest of us.
You know when we've first met,
i didn't think you're such an ass.
That's cause you didn't
know how to spot one.
See?
Progress.
Have a good evening Mrs. Chaline.
Mrs. Wells,New Tv is here.
My buddy came here to ... up.
-Thank you Miquel.
And welcome to the 200
channels of universe.
-Thanks,bye.

Leave a message after the beep.
Hi Paul.

Something's happening to me.
I need you to come, please.
Excuse me.
Sydney, it's me.
It's me.
This place.
It was just here.
What are you talking about?
This place...
There was a fire in here...weeks ago,

-I was here.
I was just here.
Where is this place.
-What's wrong?
-Everything is wrong.
Everything is wrong.
My apertment keeps changing.
-It was smoke and i was attacked by this man.
-What do you mean "attacked"?
He was on fire and then
he was gone.
Everything was gone so
i had to get out there.
And i was walking down the street and
this woman walks through me.
She walked right through me.
and I saw the shadow.
I saw it before, at the hospital,
it's some kind of escort...
...takes people away when
they are dead.
There is something so angry about them.
They don't wanna be seen.
And then this, i see people,
like nothing is wrong.
but they don't seem to see me.
Sydney, listen to me?
I'm seeing thing that are real.
I'm seeing things that i shouldn't see.
I'm deraming things that
I've never seen.
This surgery was supposed to
make me normal.
Sydney, your eyes are not
the problem.
This eyes are not my eyes.
-Yes they are.
-No they aren't.
Yes they are.
-No they aren't.
-Yes they are.
Listen to me.
you have got a disorder
We have gotta teach your brain how to
seperate out this ghost images from the real thing.
You're not listening to me.
I'm not seeing ghost images.
I see...
what, dead people?
Rooms that change,phantom....
Whatever it is that you believe you're
seeing is not real.
It's not.
It's not real.
You don't believe me.
I wanna help you.
How can you?
How can you if you don't beileve me?
You get on or what?
It's not real.
No no, It's not real.

Sydney?
-Miss Wells.
-Sydney.
Ben Paul.
Are you in there?
You have to let me in,All right
Mrs Wells.
Can you give us a minute?
Sure.
Your sister called, she said you
haven't answered the phone...
What is this?
You wanna be blind again?
At least you  were right when you were blind, you had a life,
you were engaged with the world ,you had a job.
Now, what is this?
You get scared, you just drop out to run
back to your ..... life.****
So what now?
I'm gonna take you to the hospital
and get these cuts ....
Is that really neccesary?
Yeah.
We'll figure this out.
I think you should
keep her monitoring all night.
Here is my phone number.
Sydney Wells?
You're back.
Alicia.
What are you doing?
My golfball is gone,Sydney Wells.
-What?
-I have to go now.
Hang on...
Alicia.
Alicia?
I know you're scared, don't be.
Because the world really
is beautiful.
No.
Alicia.
Don't go with him!
Alicia.
Alicia.
How are you?
Whatever is happening,
there is nothing that can't be fixed.
Good Morning.
Good Morning.
-How is your hand?
-It's fine.
Alicia's mother wanted you to have this.
She said, she talked about you all the time,
she was smiling up to the very end.
Who is she?
That's you Sydney.
That's not me.
Of course it is.
Who else would it be?
What are you doing?
Sydney.
You're scaring me.
What do you see?
Cellular memory :based on the theory that
all living tissues have the capacity to remember...
...cellular memory explains how energy
and information from...
...a donor's tissue can transfer,consciously or
unconsciously, to the recipient
Recently, recipients of organ transplants have begun
to report episodes of new found memories
...thoughts, emotions and characteristics
that are often associated to the original donor.
Sydney, i can't talk right know,i gotta go...
-Listen.
There is no history of
schizophrenia in my family,...
...I have never suffered
any mental condition.
No depression no migraine, nothing.
So for argument's sake,
let's just pretend i'm not crazy.
All right, walk with me.
There have been cases of transplants ....
who've actually shown character of the donor.
Evet, cellular memory.
There was a transplantation
in Kentucky last year.
Almost immediately felt the urgency of pick up
smoking and health her entire life.
Donor was a chain smoker?
Down to the same brand
And a few years ago, this little
girl help the police all the murder of the person
who she got a heart from.
She kept having visions of the crime.
There is some kinda chemical...
Peptide,so the
mind and body communicate.
So it's not too to suggest that...
memories can also be access
from these organs too.
No, because corneas are not major organs
it's like changing.........
But there is still a chance, isn't there?
I need that chance.
I need to find out who
the donor was.
I see her in the mirror everyday.
I have to find out who she was.
That is confidential information.
You can't ask me to do that.
I could lose my license.
Your license?
By all means,
hold on to that license.
Sydney, come on.
Sydney, come on.
Thank you
-What floor?
-14.
Excuse me.
Sorry.
Thank you.
He is here, isn't he.
My Tommy.
What is that about?
Who is Tommy?
Her son.
Where was he?
He is dead.
Who are you?
What do you want?
I wanna help you.
But how can i if you won't
even tell me.
Sydney.
Are you okay?
Sydney,open it up.
Open up.
Sydney, open up.
What the hell is going on?
-I need to find out who she is.
-Who?
My donor,her eyes....my eyes.
I'm seeing what she saw.
I'm seeing what killed her.
Sydney, please.
Helen, don't.
I love you, but there is no way
you can help me.
You're not making sense.
It's all happening to me.
Everything that happened to
her is happening to me.
Until i find out who she is...
...and what she wants,
it's gonna keep happening.
To the center please
Hey.
The only cornea transplanting
match in the day your surgery came from
...Clínica De Santa Haviera
Mosianos.****
Your donor was from Mexico.
Do you get car sick?
Why?
To 15-hour drive.
Thank you.
Files says that your donor was
Ana Christina Martinez
One living relative,mother worked in a
ceramics factory
Hopefully we can track it down.
What made you change your mind?
About what?
About coming down here with me?
What did you just let me sabotage
my career in peace?
I'm just wondering why you've changed
your mind that's it.
Was it because you believe me?
Paul,stop the car.
What did you see?
There was a fire here.
I keep seeing fire
Maybe they know something.
He says, all the doors were locked and nobody...
...could get out.
He lost a brother.
How did it happen?
He says something about the witch
You see that?
"Bruta"
I have seen it before.
What does it mean?
It means Witch.
I don't think anyone is here.
No,i work here.
Is someone from the Martinez family here
that we can speak to?
Mrs. Martinez is here but she is resting.
We can wait.
It's important.
Come in.
Come in.
Please don't be long.
She is not well.
Mrs. Martinez, my name is Sydney Wells and
this is my friend Dr. Paul Faulkner.
What do you want?
We would like to talk about your daughter.
I was wondering about how she died.
What business is this of yours?
It's hard to explain.
I have a connection...
...with your daughter.
You have her eyes.
I'm sorry for how i look. There was a fire
in the factory where i worked.
Did your daughter died in the fire?
No, but many other did.
If they had listened to Ana,
they would have been saved.
What do you mean by that?
It doesn't matter now.
Did Ana ever...
...see things she couldn't explain?
Do you see things?
Things that are not real?
Yeah.
Is that terrible thing,
to see the spiritual world isn't it?
To see souls destined to repeat death
everyday and unable to find peace?
Yeah.
Ana was always alone.
People around here suffered of her
**********
-They would blame her.
-Why would they blame her?
Sometimes when she was a little girl...
...she sat
in front of the person's house.
and she'd just cry.
and soon after somebody
in that house would die.
I know that she wasn't doing these things,
she wasn't bringing death to anyone, but...
...she just could see death.
This is the small town with
many superstitious
As i know as anything better to do all that...
-Call an ambulance.
-What?
Call an ambulance.
Every night...
She does it again and again.
Please save her.
Save her.
What happened?
She is having an heart attack.
We gotta get her to the hospital
Where are your keys?
They are in the car.
Hey,open the door.
Put her heads on first
Go around your side
Pull her in,head first.
-Can you hold her legs for me?
-Got it.
All right, close the door.
Keep the keys,you drive.
You know the way.
Hurry up.
Come on.
-I need to stay here.
-What?
I'm fine.
Just go.
I'll be quick.
Don't go anywhere.
All right Ana.
I'm here.
What do you
want me to see?
Paul?
Paul, is that you?
Ana?
Ana, no!
Help me?
Stop.
Please.
God.
No, no!
Come on, Come on.
What am i supposed to do?
Please, tell me?
Your mother ask me to save you,
but i don't know.
What am i suposed to do?
I don't know what to do here.
What?
What do you want from me?
Tell me.
Lütfen.
I believe you.
I see what you saw.
I know what you've been through.
I believe you.
It was never your fault.
How is Mrs. Martinez?
She didn't make it.
Thank you.
Hey, buddy.
What is going on?
Some high speed chase down
the American side has all border shut down.
Nearly an hour now.
****and make yourself comfortable.
Great.
Thanks.
-How long was i out?
-Not very long.
It's freezing.
What's going on?
Another some kind of chase
on the border....
Really?
Do you wanna play game?
Mommy?
Let's get back in the car.
You're scaring little girl.
Let's go.
Wait.
What...
You're scaring the hell out of her.
Let's get back in the car.
What?
Oh, God!
Sydney!
Sorry about that.
You all right? Sorry.
I see the Shadows.
They are everywhere.
Excuse me, please.
Open up.
Listen, there is gonna be an accident.
We don't have a lot of time.
Please, just let me to talk to the driver.
Okay?
Please!
Miss, what are you doing?
Oh my God.
Don't you understand?
This is what she wanted me to see.
Everything i dreamt wasn't from
Ana Christina's life. It was from this.
Right now.
She let me see that this was going to
happen so i wouldn't end up like her.
She wants me to save these people.
That's what she wants me to do.
-Sydney.
-You have to believe me.
You have to believe me.
You need to get off this bus.
Evereyone needs to get off this bus.
All of you...
You can't stay here.
Everyone listen to me.
You have to get off this bus.
-Is it like a terorist thing?
-Yes.
That's exactly what it's.
There is a bomb in the bus.
-There is a bomb.
-Quickly.
Get out.
Come on.
Get out of the car.
Everyone.
Come on.
Go from here.
There is a bomb in the bus.
Come on.
Get out.
Go, go, go.
Come on.
Out of your car.
Wait here, sweetie.
What's going on?
Out of your car.
Mom.
Come on.
Get those people out of here.
Get out of your car.
Mommy!
You all right?
My God, she is inside.
Open the door.
How?
Please.
Please, help me..
Help.
Stay back.
I'm gonna break the window.
Close your eyes.
Come here honey
Paul, let's go.
Hurry up!
Come on, come on.
Mom!
You saved them, Sydney.
You saved them.
Some say, seeing is bleveing.
Now i know what they mean.
Ana Christina tried to prevent
death.
But she was ultimately powerless
to stop it.
Ana and I sure both have
a blessing and a curse.
I know, now, I don't need eyes to
see what truly matters
The gift of Ana's sight lead me
see what i was afraid to.
To use that vision,
to not only save myself and others...
...but to give Ana the peace she
never found in life.
