Good morning, Jack.
- Good morning, gentlemen.
- Good morning, Mr. President.
- Your locator, sir.
- Thank you very much.
- Today's brief, sir.
- Thank you.
-
-
-
- Okay.
- Hey, Jack.
- Hey, Charl.
Come on, come on. Cough it up.
- Ah, goddamn spread.
- Cough up.
- Yeah.
- Listen, uh, I want to talk to you about something.
- Give me a call after work, would you?
- He's a glutton for punishment.
- Yeah, yeah.
- Aziz, good morning. We can talk now.
- No, no. I got a theory I want to float by you.
- Everything all right?
- Yeah, everything's good. Everything's good.
- All right.
Pete. After work, right?
-
-
Aziz, don't give up soccer, huh?
- Hey, Teddy. Welcome back.
- Hey, thanks.
- Gar.
- Buddy.
How'd the antiterrorist training go?
Six weeks running around Fort Benning
in the rain. I wish I could do it all over again.
- Well, that can be arranged.
- Tom.
- Good mornin', Pete.
- Is she in the gym?
- No, uh, phone to Europe.
By the way,
you, uh, made
- Ooh, I look good.
Can I get a cup of coffee before we...
What's happening at Camp David?
Matt's getting closer with Ben-Itzak
on the EastJerusalem proposal...
but it's gonna take your visit
to get him to agree.
- What about Abu Jallal?
- If we can work out the water issues,
he'll support it.
But again, we're not gonna get any firm
commitments until they have face time on Friday.
I'll be there. I'm just not gonna hang around,
'cause it loses its effectiveness.
- I understand, sir.
- Thank you, Sue. Good morning.
- Boss.
- Thank you.
- Kiss ass.
-
-
- Where's my coffee?
- Cincinnati's next move is T.B.D.
- What's the "B" stand for?
Brass ones.
Which you don't have.
-
- Any other questions? Let's get to work.
Cincinnati's on the move.
- Jill, we are off to...
- We're off to school.
- Right.
- Classic is moving.
-
-
We're set.
Ah, damn locator.
- Thanks for doing this with me, hon.
- Hmm.
- I think I'll go to the beach house this afternoon.
- All right.
- Can I help you?
- Um, Agent Breckinridge's office.
Thanks.
-
- No. I'm fine. Thanks.
Agent Breckinridge.
Jill Marin, sir.
Your secretary said
I could come in.
-
- You're late.
It's a minute past.
- Yeah. And that makes you late.
- Right. Sorry.
Second in your class at the Academy.
Well, aren't you the recruiting poster.
Any other supportive advice
before we get to know each other?
As a matter of fact, there is. If you want
a career here in P.I.D., you might want to...
invest in some more
appropriate clothing.
I was ordered to take you on. That's why
I'm here. You requested me as a T.A. Why?
My field instructor at the Academy
said you're the best investigator we have.
- Who is that?
- Pete Garrison.
Right.
Hi there. Careful now.
At your 6:00,Jefferson. Tweed jacket,
halfway up the church steps.
What's the matter, Pete?
You see somebody on the watch list?
- He just doesn't look right.
- It'll be just another minute, sir.
- All right.
Excuse me.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Hi, sir. Could we see your hands, please?
- Huh? What are...
- Take your hands out of the jacket.
- We're clear
-
I think we should hold hands.
Fine.
- Hi. How are you?
-
How are you? How are you?
Nice to meet you.
- Cincinnati's going direct to the beach house.
- Got it.
- Now, I want to introduce you to someone...
Thank you.
- Excuse me, ma'am, are you talking to me?
- Yes.
I thought it was, uh,
an excellent speech.
- One to 10?
- Ten, ma'am.
You're not a very good liar, Pete.
-
- Yes. L... I really want to know.
- 9.5.
Excuse me.
Charlie. Charlie!
Oh, my God. Charlie.
Somebody! Help! Charlie. Charlie.
Somebody help!
- Excuse me.
- Um, yeah. Sorry.
- So all of these are from last week?
- That's about half of them.
- And then there are the verbal threats.
- They sound worse in English.
- Yeah.
We got this guy yesterday.
Did you translate this?
- No. But whoever did's not a native speaker.
- How do you know that?
Well, he translated here...
And that literally means "to put pressure
on him, he bit the guy."
It's slang.
It means he bribed him.
He didn't bite him.
Good.
We need to talk.
I think you have a little spinach
or something in your teeth.
I want you to route all calls
through to my cell.
You picked a hell of a day
to start your field work.
- Button up your jacket.
- Why? What goin' on?
-
- I really don't need them breathin' down my neck.
What do they know
about investigatin' murder?
She can breathe
down my neck.
But not him.
Agents Breckinridge, Marin.
Secret Service.
- You guys bring lunch?
- Not today.
As the guy reaches for it,
Merriweather goes for his gun.
- You think this is a street crime?
- In my gut, yeah.
You know my problem
with gut feelings?
Once you have them,
the only evidence you see...
is the evidence that reinforces
your gut feeling.
-
- There's no money left in his wallet...
and there's been a series of robberies here
the last two months.
Well, Agent Merriweather spent the last 25 years
honing his ability to sense danger...
to notice anything
outside of the ordinary...
so for some average street criminal to get
the drop on him... yeah, it raises questions.
Not to mention that he's been
shot here twice with a.45.
I'm gonna take a guess here, but from your initial
canvassing, I bet you no one heard anything.
Any homicide cop will tell you that sort
of thing happens all the time.
Yeah, I bet they would, Detective.
- Rosario.
Anyone want anything
to eat or drink?
- Uh, no, thanks, ma'am. I think we're fine.
- Well, I'm hungry.
Tom, sweep downstairs and go for dinner.
I'll sweep upstairs, sit post till the shift change.
You sure?
You've been on as long as me.
- You gonna make me change my mind?
-
- Bad guy used a silencer.
That's why nobody heard it.
And that's what slowed down
the velocity of the bullet...
and stopped it
from penetrating the wood...
which it easily would have done had it been
traveling at its normal rate of speed.
The shooter was standing
right here.
Excuse me. Agent Merriweather's
firearm... the safety's still on.
We assumed he just didn't
have time to flick it off.
Agent Marin, why don't you explain
to the detectives why that is unlikely.
If he was a police officer, it would make
sense because your academy trains you...
to draw your weapon and flip
the safety in two separate actions...
to avoid accidental shootings.
Our academy trains us to draw
and flip in a single motion.
If he managed to draw his weapon,
his safety should have been off.
Bottom line...
Agent Merriweather was assassinated.
I want the murder weapon.
I don't care if you have to drag the Potomac.
If this man was one of yours, you would have
treated him with a lot more respect.
Let's get a gurney up here!
Well, we try to do
the best job we can.
Hopefully you sleep better at night.
- And I definitely do.
- Garrison, DiPaola. We're good on the perimeter.
-
- Uh, roger, 10-60.
I let DiPaola go early,
so, uh, he can...
get something to eat.
- Hi.
- Hi.
You all right?
I missed you.
I missed you so much.
- Just a second.
- Okay.
- This is outstanding.
- There you go. And enjoy.
I love you, Sarah.
-
- Garrison, DiPaola, where are you?
- Shit.
Yeah, I'm on my way.
Hi. So what the hell
is going on, or...
Aziz, what are you doin' here?
Charlie Merriweather was murdered.
He... He was murdered?
P.I.D. Thinks it might
be connected to work.
Director put us on alert.
I'm sorry.
I know he was your friend.
Was there any kind
of shift in his behavior?
Was he agitated
or worried about anything?
- Did he tell you why?
- He just said he had a couple
of tough days at work.
- What'd he say at breakfast?
- Some gossip. Uh, it's kind of personal.
Nancy, I know how difficult
this is for you...
but I need a complete picture
if I'm gonna investigate this properly.
He told me that he thought Pete Garrison was
having an affair with someone's wife at work.
- Just gossip. It just...
- Yeah.
Probably not even true.
Look, that's all we need for now.
-
- Screw you.
- What?
- Screw you.
- You still got a problem with me?
-
Christ. It doesn't matter
what I say to you.
I don't care if you got
a problem with me...
but you show respect
when you come to this house.
Charlie was one of my best friends.
If you have information
that can help me, that I want to hear.
- Otherwise, stay out of my way.
- Fine. You're a piece of work.
You know, Nancy did say one thing.
Charlie was upset about something at work.
You have any idea what that might be?
- No.
- Then if you figure it out,
you know where to find me.
- Yeah, good. I'll send you a memo.
- Do that.
- Hey. Is everything okay?
- Hey, Jill. Yeah.
- You workin' with him now?
- Yeah.
Keep your eyes open.
You may learn a lot.
But don't listen
to everything he's got to say.
- Especially about me.
-
Pete.
There some problem between you two?
- I thought you were friends.
- We were.
- So what happened?
- It's personal.
- No. He can go to hell. I don't want to talk to him.
- Just tell him it wasn't me.
- It wasn't anybody.
- I'm not saying it was.
- I wasn't having an affair!
- Cindy, I know you weren't.
What do you want me to tell him I haven't already
told him 30 times? This is why I left him.
He's the most pigheaded man
I've ever met.
You still love him, don't you?
-
- Hey, Tom.
You know a guy
named Walter Xavier?
Yeah, sure. He's a snitch I used to use
when I was working in counterfeiting.
Okay. Just fielded a call
from this guy.
I told him you weren't
running informants anymore...
offered to transfer
the call to W.F.O., P.I.D.
- He said you're the only person he'd talk to.
- Thanks.
Did you fill yours out yet?
Let's walk.
You got some info on that
Charlie Merriweather murder?
- That agent who was killed
outside his house on Monday?
- Yeah.
Maybe he stumbled into something
he wasn't supposed to, like I did.
- What was that something?
- A plot to kill the president.
Walter, you know, it's a little
more difficult than it sounds.
Not if you got somebody inside.
You saying there's a mole
in the Secret Service?
That's right.
- There's an agent who wants to
help assassinate the president?
- That's right.
- Well, what's his name?
- I don't know. I just know he exists.
Well, how? Who... Who's giving
you the information?
- I want one million dollars.
- What are you smoking, Walter?
- Now be serious.
- I'm dead serious.
I tell you this stuff, you roll these guys up,
they gonna know I'm the one.
- They'll hunt me down.
- We'll put you in protective custody.
Yeah, and I'll be dead in a day.
Listen, you got a traitor in your organization.
- You get me the money, and I will disappear.
- I gotta be honest with you.
Lfind it pretty far-fetched we got agents
in on an assassination attempt.
Here. Maybe this will change
your mind, okay?
Yeah, whoever this traitor is...
they're either on the president's detail
or in a key liaison position.
Listen, I want a list of everyone
who's got "Q" clearance.
And where's the president
right now?
Press conference at his house.
Twenty minutes.
to take on the infrastructure
of terrorism...
wherever we find it
anywhere around the globe.
How reliable is this guy Xavier?
I've built three counterfeiting cases
using his information.
-
- Mid-level guys, Barranquilla Cartel.
Sir. That's everyone
with "Q" clearance.
Polygraph everyone
on that list...
and stand up a red team
to find the traitor.
Now, I'm going to assume that the hit
on Merriweather is connected to this...
- And we put Breckinridge
in charge of the whole thing.
- He's the best we've got?
- Yeah.
- Pete. He's kind of a protégé of yours.
What do you think?
- He'll follow the evidence wherever it leads him.
-
You can have anybody you want.
From I.D., from the field.
You get carte blanche.
- Not right now.
- Oh, sorry.
- I can tell personnel you need to lose the rookie.
- No, I'm gonna keep her.
She hasn't been ruined
by years in the field.
We have intel that
representatives of Al-Qaeda...
have met on at least two occasions
with the Barranquilla leadership.
You think it's timed to coincide
with the Camp David talks?
Probably. The threat alone
interferes with the process.
People who haven't worked
at the White House in at least two cycles.
They'll integrate
with both of your teams.
We're all gonna be looking over
each other's shoulders till we find this guy, sir.
Well, do what you have to to protect me,
but I want the threat...
the investigation,
I want everything kept classified.
- Is that clear?
- Mr. President...
we're going to need to get
everyone involved here.
What do you think would happen
to the power of the president...
if people thought I wasn't even safe
from my own Secret Service?
It took over 200 years to create
the symbol of the presidency...
and I'm not gonna undermine it
with something like this.
- Let's circle the wagons, okay? You all right?
- Fine.
Good, let's do that.
How do we proceed?
Bill, you're the guy.
You're the last line of defense.
You can protect him better
than any of us can.
Is there anything else that you can think of
that'll help you do that?
- Yeah.
This.
You can bank on it.
Thank you very much. Good night.
Good night. Thank you.
Heads it's Sixth Street,
tails it's Eighth.
Bravo cars.
- This way, Mr. President.
- Thank you, Bill.
Classic is moving to bravo cars.
Sir, could you put down that knife?
It's not what they wanted to hear.
It's what they needed to hear.
Hello, young lady.
Where'd this guy come from?
He's an old C.I. Of Garrison's.
Nine, 10 years.
- Garrison?
- Mm-hmm.
What's wrong?
It's nothing.
- Are you sure?
- Yes. It's okay.
- How do I find Xavier?
- Um, I don't know where he lives.
- He's a fanatic about not being followed.
-
- What?
- Have you ever tried?
He wants a million bucks from us, Dave.
I'm sure he'll contact us.
You better be right.
You get in touch with us
as soon as you find him.
-
- A little over half.
"Over half"?
The president's life is at stake.
Heads up!
I want everybody in this room to have had
a polygraph by 5:00 p.m. This afternoon...
- Were you born in Morocco?
- No.
- Do you live in Bethesda?
- No.
-
- No.
Uh, yes. I was involved
with an investigation with the bureau...
- Just yes or no answers, please.
- Okay, Stan. Yes.
Are you up?
The witch hunt is on.
Get your polygraph today.
How did they get these?
Night-vision camera on a boat
stabilized by a gyroscope.
Pretty sophisticated.
I'm so sorry, Sarah.
I'm sorry.
It's gotta be someone
inside the Service.
Who?
The same agent plotting
to killJohn? Who?
a traitor in the Secret Service.
Now, all of a sudden, there's two?
I don't buy that.
Somehow they're connected.
Maybe this is the assassination?
This is a death sentence forJohn,
a political death sentence.
That's not gonna happen.
Oh, Pete.
Let's get this goddamn
witch hunt over with.
- Just relax.
- I'm relaxed.
- Were you divorced in 1998?
- No.
- Have you received adequate training
for your profession?
- No.
But I did stay
in a Holiday Inn Express.
No.
Have you done anything
in the past 30 days...
- to violate Secret Service protocol?
- No.
No.
I could use a few of those.
- Thanks.
- You look exhausted, Bill.
- You look worse.
I haven't slept since
we went on alert.
Well, I'm back on.
It's worse than going to confession.
- You know I can't even
let you back on duty unless...
- Yeah, I'll go now.
-
- Yes.
-
- No.
-
-
No.
Have you done anything
to endanger the life...
of our president
in the last six months?
- Not that I know of.
- Yes or no answers, please.
No. No.
Welcome to Mayflower Hotel.
-
- Are you Mr. Garrison?
- Yes.
You have a phone call.
You can take it here.
- Thank you.
- Walk three blocks
east on Massachusetts Avenue.
- Take a left on 12th Street.
Las Palmas Coffee Shop.
- All right.
- F.B.I. Drop it!
- Federal agent! Federal agent!
- F.B.I. Freeze! Put it down!
- The gun is going down!
- All right. Back up now. Back up.
- What the hell were you doin' at Las Palmas?
- Havin' a goddamn cup of coffee.
What the hell's goin' on here?
Is that one of your agents I'm following?
Sorry for the crossover.
We're not out of here till tomorrow.
The president decided they should arrive
at the summit together. Where were you?
Oh! Excuse me.
Oh, here we are. Now, Kate, this
is your weekend to catch the trout.
- I don't like worms.
- No, no. This is fly-fishing.
Pete, can I talk
to you a minute?
Yes, sir.
We're really, both of us...
in uncharted territory here,
aren't we?
An assassin inside
the Secret Service?
Inside my detail?
Now, Bill's been briefing me,
of course, but...
this guy's your informant, right?
- Yes, sir.
- I want to get some of this firsthand...
so let's make time at Camp David
to do that, all right?
Yes, sir.
Good afternoon, Mr. President.
Good afternoon.
I'll see you at dinner.
- So, Karen, how do things stand?
- It's time for you to weigh in.
- Can I get you in there now for a few hours?
- Absolutely.
Sarah, the wives are talking about having tea.
If you could stop by, it would be great.
- Sure.
- Tom, we're gonna walk it.
What's going on, Pete?
Why don't they just tell us what they want?
- It's okay. It's gonna be fine.
- Nothing about this feels okay or fine or...
- It will be.
- Has that guy called you?
- What's his name? What's that guy's name?
- Xavier.
- Has he called you?
- Not yet. No.
- Katie, hi.
- Good afternoon, ma'am.
- Hi.
- Would you care for tea?
It's such a beautiful day.
Why don't we have tea outside?
- Well, that's a great idea. How was your flight?
- Short.
-
- Afraid so.
Your informant's on the phone.
- Do you got the money?
- I got $100,000 in cash...
- Yeah, right.
- Walter, we haven't screwed you in the past.
And don't try to bring nobody.
I'll walk if I spot 'em.
I cannot get there in 20 minutes.
-
- Okay, you heard him. Let's go.
- Breckinridge and Marin are already on the way.
- All right.
- Get the money bag and a car ready, please.
- Okay. Got it.
He knows we're following him.
He went where he can mix up with a crowd.
There's no way
we get surveillance in there.
Hold it. There's no way I'm gonna
let you go without a backup. No.
- Chaminski. Chaminski goes with you.
- Let's go.
At your 1:00.
Check your 9:00.
Check your 9:00! Check your 9:00!
Check your 9:00!
Get down! Secret Service!
Get down!
Shots fired. Shots fired.
Agent down.
The shooter has blond hair, dark jacket.
He's on the lower level.
They're shooting.
They're right behind the doors.
Heads.
Pete, we're at the north end of the mall.
Lower level.
I'm a hundred yards south of you.
Unholster your weapon.
Keep it down.
-
- Copy that. Stagger off 10 feet.
Get out of here!
Take the point.
I don't have a visual!
Go!
Pete. Pete!
You okay?
Do you have any idea why your informant
wanted to have you killed?
No. I'm wondering the same thing.
You might want to figure
that one out, Pete.
Presidential helicopter
just went down.
Marine One,
Marine One,
the presidential
helicopter has crashed.
It happened just moments ago
about a half mile south of Camp David.
The chopper went down
in some densely wooded...
-  Marine One...
- Our friend was insufficiently motivated.
-
-
Marine One
- You failed.
- I did exactly what I promised.
He wasn't on board.
That is the only thing that matters.
That is the only thing I give a shit a...
Do you understand?
Now, we're gonna meet
and we're gonna discuss this.
Deadly against
any low-altitude aircraft...
including jets,
prop planes and helicopters.
-
-
Well, it sure doesn't look like
you're here to bury the hatchet.
You're being investigated for treason.
- What are you talk...
- Step back.
- Excuse me?
- Step back.
- Hey, Jill.
- Pete.
- Matt.
- Pete.
Sorry for the intrusion, sir.
If I failed the polygraph,
then why am I still on duty?
Director didn't want to arrest one of
the guys responsible for saving Reagan's life...
How long you been working
for the Barranquilla Cartel?
What are you talking about?
- Hugo, can you come in here, please?
Pete Garrison,
Special Agent Ortega with the F.B.I.
- I was having a cup of coffee.
- Takes you four hours to have a cup of coffee?
I was killing a few hours at a coffee shop.
Is there a problem with that?
Tom DiPaola said he called you four times.
You never returned any of his messages.
And that you almost missed
the  flight yesterday.
They moved the flight up two hours.
I was in the coffee shop.
It was noisy.
I couldn't hear my cell phone.
Now, wh-wh-what is this?
What the hell are you doing following me?
Las Palmas Coffee Shop is a dead drop
for the Barranquilla Cartel.
I wanna know your number one
go-to guy at the cartel.
And I wanna know how you were gonna
help them kill the president.
Why would I want to kill the president?
What motive do I have?
I have given my entire life
to the Secret Service.
- I've gotten up at 4:00 a.m.
Every goddamn morning.
- Is that what this is about?
You're bitter after all your years of service
that they didn't make you director?
Oh, no. Don't confuse your own ambition
with mine. Okay, Dave?
Come on, Pete. Think about it.
People would understand that.
Jesus Christ, you took a bullet
for the president of the United States.
in charge of P.P.D., do they?
Even if they did take
a bullet for the old man.
- I think this whole thing is getting personal.
- We got you nailed to the wall.
- I didn't have an affair with Cindy.
-
- You can't accept that.
- We are not talking about that!
We're talking about it all the time,
even when we're not talking about it!
You can't look at me
without thinking about it!
- Jesus Christ, Pete, you better get a grip.
- I got a grip.
You think I wrecked your marriage,
and it has completely clouded your judgment.
I am following the evidence
and it is overwhelming.
The polygraph. Las Palmas Coffee Shop.
You had unfettered access to
It was hit by a missile
for Christ's sake!
It was hit by a missile
because the flares...
and the four other countermeasures
were disengaged!
There was a hundred other people
who had access to it.
Explain to me
about the bank account.
- The what? The...
-
I'm being framed.
- Tell me that's not your signature.
- Think about it!
I'm the guy that initiated
this investigation.
Why would I do that
if I wanted to kill the president?
You initiated this investigation
for a traitor in our department...
so that when the assassination
actually took place...
- You take me in, that's the end.
That guy is out there somewhere!
The director just rolled up outside.
You better start thinking
about cooperating.
He's in the car.
- What are you doing, Pete?
- Getting a glass of water.
- That's very impressive.
-
- Want a beer?
- Look, Pete, we're really...
Garrison back door.
Oh, shit.
Pete!
Pete!
Where is he?
- Sorry.
This is Breckinridge. Garrison has escaped
from the rear of the residence into the alley.
Cordon off the area
and get back to me.
- He got my radio.
- He got my gun too.
He got your gun?
And your radio?
Just get me out of here.
But the fact is, the evidence
against him is overwhelming.
So, how do we find him?
To begin with, know this.
And he will use that against you.
He also knows that it's gonna be
very difficult for you...
to pull the trigger
if you have him in your sights.
So I want you to take a second
and visualize that.
- Can I have one of these here?
- Yeah, sure. Take it.
- Yeah?
Backstop, go.
Cincinnati wrapping up. We're alpha for departure.
I miss the good old days.
Do you know what I mean? I really literally do.
-
-
See you later, okay?
Be right back.
Thank you.
- Welke, DiPaola. Cincinnati's coming to you.
- Copy that.
Ma'am.
What are you doing here?
I heard you were arrested for the helicopter.
Whatever you hear about me in the next few days,
I want you to know I was framed.
- I had to tell you to your face.
- No, you don't. No, you don't.
- We're gonna get out of this.
- How?
I haven't figured that out yet.
- This is out of control.
You've got to turn yourself in.
- No, no.
- Yes, you do. I'll go toJohn. I'll tell him everything.
- I can't let you do that.
Pete, they think you're an assassin.
They will kill you.
- You can cover my back.
- How?
The director has got a daily password
for the agents. Find out what it is.
- I'm checking through stuff.
-
You turned around
when it rang, didn't you?
Yeah, I did.
Ballsy. Very ballsy.
DiPaola said she seemed
completely unfazed.
She came upstairs, waited five minutes
and told him what happened.
Okay.
I'm just trying to understand
why he came here and why she reacted that way.
- This is your post?
-
Naturally, the first lady
doesn't want to believe...
the man protecting her
for the last eight months...
is trying to assassinate her husband.
That's why Pete came here.
He's looking for an ally.
And the first lady is
a very powerful ally to have.
Great. The idea is
to secure the entire site.
Start looking for cars
that were taken within walking distance...
of the restaurant
or any of the nearby metro stations.
Then within those parameters,
I want you to isolate Accords...
- Tauruses, Camrys and Explorers.
- How do you know what kind
of car he's gonna steal?
If he tries to breach our computers,
we can find out where he's connecting from.
He knows we would know that.
He wouldn't do it.
- He could connect to someone else.
- How?
Well, he'd need
that person's password.
But as a supervisor, it wouldn't be hard
to get access to others' passwords.
- Why would he do that?
Why would he even risk it?
- Because he feels trapped.
We have his credit cards,
his cell phone.
- Can I help you?
- Oh, yes, ma'am.
My name is Lawson Smith.
I'm looking for a Walter Xavier.
Oh, lovely boy,
but he been gone a long time.
- Well, this is the address
we have on his sweepstakes form.
- Sweepstakes?
- Yes, ma'am. I'm with Publishers Clearing House.
- He win?
- Well, he's a finalist.
- Million dollars.
- And you must be his mother.
- Uh-huh.
Mrs. Miller. I'm remarried.
Would you have another address
or telephone number where I might reach him?
Oh, I'd love to help ya
get in touch with Walter.
Bet he could use the money, but...
I don't know where he is.
Walter and me haven't spoke
in three years.
Well, if you do talk to him,
tell him we got in touch.
Thank you, ma'am.
Have a good day.
Leave a message.
Walter, it's Mom.
A guy just come by the house
lookin' for ya. He's a cop.
On a gut level
it doesn't make sense.
- The only thing this guy
cares about in life is his job.
- And you know this, why?
Because he went out to the Academy
a few times and ran your field exercises?
Listen to me. Pete Garrison
was my best friend...
for 10 years...
till he slept with my wife.
So trust me when I tell you, the only thing
Pete Garrison cares about is Pete Garrison.
- Yeah?
- Somebody who's not Tom DiPaola...
just signed in to our databases
using DiPaola's password.
- Pulled up an address in Andrewsboro, Maryland.
- I don't believe this.
Get the rest of the team ready.
Let's go.
- Walter!
Take the cars around
to the other side!
Pete!
Pete!
Damn it.
This is Breckinridge.
I'm in a salvage boat at the end of the dock.
-
- Copy that.
- Whoa, whoa.
- Secret Service.
Pete, don't move!
Pete!
- The traitor is still out there, Dave.
-
If that's true, come on in.
We'll protect you.
- The only reason that I'm alive
is they don't know where I am.
- Don't make me do this.
-
- Don't make me do this. Pete!
You want to shoot me?
Forget about the Kevlar.
Shoot me in my face!
Come on! Shoot me!
- What happened?
- I took him down with a shot to the vest.
I couldn't take the second shot.
I couldn't take the second shot.
- the president's going to be in
over the next few days?
- G8 Summit. Toronto.
It's a nightmare for us.
Canadians are allowing the protestors
all the way up to the three perimeter.
The border's not gonna stop him.
It's 3,500 miles long and barely patrolled.
You really think it's him,
don't you?
- Pete, you scared me!
- Nancy, I'm sorry. I can explain everything.
What is going on?
What the hell's been happening?
I think Charlie got wind of an assassination
plot by one of the other agents...
so I want to check his computer files,
see if there's any indication of evidence.
Is that why there's a car
watching the house?
-
- I think they're the guys that got Charlie.
Nancy, I'm gonna need the keys
to your car, and I want you to call the police.
- Okay.
- Thanks.
She didn't go nowhere.
She didn't go nowhere, so I left.
What do you want me to do?
Come on.
Yes, yes, by herself.
Okay. Yeah, yeah. No, no.
- Shooting. Shooting.
- Huh? Huh?
- Shooting!
Your name? Your name!
Who sent you? Who sent you!
Come on. Come on.
- Hi, Jill.
- Pete?
Yeah. Look, I just got into a shootout.
He's a foreign operative.
He's got a lot of passports and a lot of cash.
He's got full security access
to the G8 Summit in Toronto tomorrow.
Yeah.
Pete, we've been through the entire place,
but you're gonna have to be straight with me.
- What are you talking about?
- There's no body.
- There's blood all over the goddamn place.
- There's blood all over...
but there's no body, no passports,
no G8 credentials.
Listen. This is not enough
to take back to Overbrook and clear you.
They're gonna hit him
in Toronto, G8 Summit.
Pete. Pete?
- Sarah?
Listen, I'm leaving
for Toronto tonight.
Montrose wants to move me
up there early for security purposes.
- Oh!
California. My sister.
I'll call her back.
Well, this is the speech I'm gonna give.
I'm... I'm reasonably happy.
Maybe you could take a look
at that if you get a chance.
Okay. Thanks.
I've got to turn this off
before they track me.
I love you.
I want you to get the crime scene unit
out here immediately.
- Rip this place apart. Find me something now.
- This is Agent Breckinridge.
- Agent Breckinridge?
Sarah Ballentine.
Thanks, Tom.
- Could I offer you a drink?
- No, thank you, ma'am.
You know, most women
don't like whiskey...
but my mama was from Tennessee.
Pete Garrison and I are having an affair.
Please have a seat.
And... that's for you.
You know, I don't know
all the evidence you have against him...
but I do know why he failed
the lie detector test.
And I know why he was
in that coffee shop looking for someone.
Hello. U.S. Secret Service
up for the G8.
I got a priority item
for the duty officer over at the lab.
- That'll be that direction on the eighth floor.
- Thank you.
Sign the log, please.
I need any prints that
you can find off this cup.
- Okay.
- Thank you very much.
See you in about 12 minutes.
I'm gonna be pushing
post in a few minutes...
- but if you want to grab a coffee...
- Marin.
- Hey, Jill. This is Pete.
- A lot of people are looking for you.
I'm sure they are.
- Did you find any prints at the apartment?
- No. Nothing.
I did. You gotta help me out. If I e-mail
the prints to you, how long is it gonna take...
to check them against the F.B.I.
And C.I.A. Databases?
Five minutes after I receive 'em.
I'll call you five minutes
after I send them. Bye.
I've got a print in here.
Could somebody run it for me, please?
- Yeah, I got it.
- Thank you.
In my experience a guilty man
doesn't break into a police station...
and check fingerprints
for a few hours.
What do you think?
My phone was only on
for five minutes.
I was in the neighborhood.
Dave, I can't explain about the bank account.
The other things I can explain.
- I know about the affair.
- It wasn't with Cindy.
Oh, I know. The first lady.
She told me everything.
I know you're being framed.
She showed me the blackmail photos.
So where does that leave us?
- We need to find this guy.
- Come here.
Yeah.
You really are an idiot,
you know that?
- You honestly thought that
this wouldn't be uncovered?
- Dave, I love her.
Well, that's practical.
The prints belong
to Gennady Ivanov, former K.G.
now works for the personal security service
for the president of Karjastan.
I'm also showing confirmed intel
that this is the guy...
Confirmed intel on what,
Agent Marin?
This is a classified conversation.
We'll be out of here in two minutes.
- Yeah. Whatever.
- Thank you.
These people have the financial
and intelligence resources to pull this off.
All right, let's get going.
We've still gotta find the mole.
We polygraphed every agent
with access to the president.
Yours was the only one
that showed deception.
We need to figure out
how the real traitor passed the test.
Montrose had the list.
You know I never guaranteed you success.
Security's tighter than it's ever been.
Routes, modes of transport,
they're all random now.
I mean, if you wanted him on that helicopter
at Camp David, you could have put him there.
That's not gonna work anymore.
- You did make a deal.
- Yeah.
Twenty years ago with the K.G.B.,
which doesn't even exist anymore.
Do you want out, William?
Then give me... the president.
No.
I don't care.
Expose me.
I don't care if I spend the rest
of my life in prison for treason.
I don't care if you kill me.
- Here you go.
- Have a pint.
Oh. Thank you.
William...
if you don't do this,
we're not gonna kill you.
We are going to kill her.
And we're gonna kill her.
And then we're gonna kill her.
You do have a way out.
But only one.
When he finishes his speech,
you take him on the primary route...
to the "B" motorcade
under the plaza...
and you take the radios out.
Then that's it.
And we'll do the rest.
Hey, look.
You can keep those.
I got doubles.
Jill, it's David. I want you to get
in touch with Downing and Medina.
Confirm for me which one did
Montrose's polygraph and get back to me.
-
-
- Everybody ready?
- Yes, sir.
Let's do this.
- Yeah, tell me what you got.
- Montrose didn't take the polygraph.
- You're 100% sure?
Positive. Polygraphers have no record
of Montrose even being tested.
- Neither one of them.
- Montrose didn't take the polygraph.
Now let there be no mistake.
In an uncertain and an unsafe world...
America must be strong.
But previous administrations...
I also hacked into
Merriweather's staff mail.
He was streaming
someone's offshore phone logs.
- The logs are Montrose's.
- Give me the phone.
Hi, Jill. It's Pete.
Get a hold of the first lady and tell her...
only her... that it's Montrose.
Got it.
Jesus Christ, Pete. The first lady?
What were you thinkin'?
I never saw it coming, Dave.
I've got a scope on subject Garrison.
It's Garrison and Breck.
Holster your weapons.
Holster your weapons!
Subject in my sight.
Do I take the shot?
- We must embrace the ideal
of an African economic union.
- Need assistance, over.
- He's a Do Not Admit.
- We have orders.
- I am countermanding your orders!
- You don't control this site.
- Montrose does.
- Don't call him!
- Montrose is the mole!
- Montrose?
What's the procedure for that?
Ma'am.
Something's wrong.
My radio just went dead.
I've lost my radio.
I don't have any radio.
-
- I've got silence on all channels.
- It's going down!
- Agent Garrison called on my line.
He wanted me to tell you
that Montrose is the mole.
- Get your hands in the air!
- Put that down!
- Pete Garrison is not the mole!
-
- But at the same time...
- Mr. President.
-
This way, Mr. President.
- Do not let Montrose move the president!
- Montrose, he's getting away!
Crystal. Crystal is the password.
We need your help.
Tom, get the first lady to the motorcade.
It's all right.
- Freeze!
- Password is Crystal.
Where'd Montrose take the president?
- Motorcade "B."
- Stay with me, ma'am.
This way.
- It's just this way, ma'am.
- Tom, where are we going?
We're going to motorcade "C," ma'am.
That's a hell of a way
to leave the G8.
Go in twos.
What's next, boss?
What's the next move?
-
- Bill?
Hold the corridor.
Push 'em back.
Crystal!
You okay?
- I think so.
- Turn off your locator.
What?
Your locator, turn it off. That's how
they know where we are. They're tracking us.
How do you...
How do you know?
Oh, no, Bill. Oh, God.
My family. My family. Pete!
Mr. President,
you're gonna have to trust us.
Shooter's at 11:00.
I'll go high. You go low. You ready?
- Yeah.
-
Get the president upstairs.
We'll cover you from here.
This way, ma'am.
As quick as you can.
Yes. Garrison.
Coming to you, Pete.
Go. Go! Go, go!
All right, we're gonna
get you out of here.
Pete, I got him.
Mr. President, you're with me.
Go, go, go, go!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God.
-
-
Carl.
Listen, Pete, um...
You take care of yourself.
I'll save you a tee time.
Tom, you did a great job.
I was proud to work with you.
- Thanks.
- Thanks a lot.
I'll see you guys. Good careers.
Take care.
Do well, guys. See you soon.
- Hey, Pete.
- Yeah?
- This could be trouble.
- I'm gonna walk out of the
White House carrying this?
Thanks, guys.
- Bye-bye. All the best.
-
You gonna leave
without saying good-bye?
Well, look who's no longer a rookie.
Thanks.
So, how about
a little retirement dinner tonight?
I can't. I got a date.
- Something you want to tell me?
- With my wife.
That's great.
- Pete.
- See you around campus, Jill.
- Thanks for everything.
- Pleasure.
Yeah, I'm gonna miss it.
It's gonna miss you too.
Take care.
