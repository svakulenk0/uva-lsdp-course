Tyler, let's go, man.
Skinny, come on, man.

You just wanna be Rocky.

- Wanna pull guns? I'll show you mine.
- Shut up, man.
Do you feel like because you a white boy,
you got to overcompensate sometimes?
Wow! Wow!

Hold up. That's PJ.
Man...
- What is he doin'?
- Skinny, what are you...
What the hell you think you doin'? Am I
the only one not tryin' to get us killed?
I ain't afraid of him.
You waited till the car got around
the corner before you threw something.
- That's real brave.
- I ain't afraid of nobody.
I ain't afraid of you
and I'm definitely not afraid of you.
- I'll throw something at you.
- That's how you miss.
- Stand still, then.
-
- Where was it?
- There.
Oh...
Hey, yo, come on, man!
I know this place.
It's that school.
- This don't look like no school.
- It is a school. I'll show you.
- Skinny!
-
- He's your brother. You go get him.
- Come on.
- I ain't goin' in there.
- Come on.
Damn!
Watch yourself.
Come on, man.
Shh, shh, shh.
- This looks like a museum.
- It's not a museum.
Ty, man, quit playin', man.
Look. Skinny's right.
This is a school.
- Arts school.
-  I told you.
- Who goes here, then?
- Look like some stuck-up rich folks.
Look at these dudes.
All sweet with the shirts all tight
like they spray-painted 'em on.
Yeah.
It do show off their muscles
pretty nice, though.
- No, I'm just...
- No, no. Don't touch me.
- Mac. I'm just...
- Don't touch me.
I'm just sayin'
they in good shape is all.
- We need to get you a girl fast.
- I got girls. I just don't show 'em to ya.
- Why?
- Y'all are gonna try and take 'em.
- What you talkin' about?
-  Check this out!
- Look at this place.
- We got nothin' like this in our school.
That's 'cause our school's broke.
Hey, yo, wait up.
These rich kids get everything.
What is this, man?
Seems like a playground to me.
# Figaro, Figaro,
Figaro, Figaro, Figaro
Look at this stuff.
Let's bounce, man.
- Skinny, what are you...?
- It was a accident.
Skinny, don't worry.
These rich kids can afford this. Look. Ha!
-
-
Look, look.
# Oh-wah...
- Hey, heads up!
- Whoa!
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
# La la la-la
I challenge you.
I win!
- It's a rumble.
- Aah!
- Oof!
-
That ain't funny, man.
Look out! Whoa!
Hey, yo, yo, watch out!
Ha-ha!
- Having fun?
- Get off me!
Party's over.
You're comin' with me.
- I didn't do nothin', man. Get off...
-  Go, go, go, man.
Yo, Ty!
Man, just go. Go!
- Very noble.
- Shut up, rent-a-cop!
Breaking and entering, vandalism
of the Maryland School of the Arts.
- You a student there?
- No.
You've been in this courtroom several
times. Where are your foster parents?
- Can you answer me with a sentence?
- My foster mom's trying to get off work.
OK, Mr. Gage, look.
This is the way we play the game here.
You break it, you buy it.
performed at the scene of the offense -
the Maryland School of the Arts.
Whatever.
I got here as fast as I could.
We're back.
- What'd he get?
- 200 hours community service.
Won't make it.
He's never stayed with anything.
Why do you care?
You get your check every month.
- Kids, wash up.
- What did you say?
Wait, slow down. You're makin' Bill dizzy
and he's not even drunk yet.
Guys, come on. Let's just have a nice
dinner before I have to go back to work.
I'm not hungry.
Hey, shut up!
I'm trying to watch this!

Are you going to prison?
How many times
do I have to tell you to knock?
That's where my dad is, at the supermax.
He liked it better at Jessup.
No, Camille,
I'm not goin' to prison.
But they are gonna have to take me
to prison if you don't start knocking.
Get outta here.
Excuse me.
I need that new arrangement.
I see. We were hoping to link the
fund-raiser to the fall showcase. Mm-hm.
So we absolutely
can't do it on a Friday?
I'm Tyler Gage.
I'm here to...
Come in, Mr. Gage.
Take a seat.
We'll just have to move the event till March
and hope the Pratts come through.
Thanks, Denise.
Well, I see that you're
overwhelmed with remorse.
You have no idea of the consequences
of your actions, do you?
Yeah. 200 hours.
Actually, there's a little more to it.
Most of our students
are here on scholarship.
The cost of repairing
the damage that you did
is roughly the equivalent
of one student's tuition.
Do you understand
what that means?
You just cost someone their future.
Sorry.
Look, I'm just here to do my hours.
It says here that your school day
finishes at two.
Per the court's order, you're to report here
and stay until 5:30.
Now, if you'll follow me, Mr. Gage,
I have someone who is
very eager to meet you.
- Mr. McCaffrey.
- Director Gordon.
This is Tyler Gage,
your new intern.
I'd like a daily report
on his activities.
Great. Here you go.
And stop
and bring it around front
and one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven.
And a-one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, go!
One, two, three, four
and five, six, seven. And up!
And now up!
Um, hello.
Who is that?
Come on, he is fine.
Don't you have a boyfriend?
Yes, and my boyfriend would
appreciate my good taste. Thank you.
One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven.
And a-one, two and three and four.
Good, Nora. Six, seven.
And a-one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven.
And a-one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight.
And one, two, three, four...
- Hey.
- Hey.
And a-one, two, three,
four and five, six, seven.
And a-one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight.
Good class, you guys.
Good job.
- So I'll see you at rehearsal, OK, Andrew?
- You got it.
- Hey, baby.
- Hey.
- Walk you to your next class?
- I just gotta stop by my locker.
- All right.
- How are you?
- Good. How was class?
- It was good.
Guys, is that our new janitor?
He's not a janitor.
That's the guy who trashed the theater.
Really?
Ooh.
I love a man in a uniform.
Hey.
You with the garbage-man jumpsuit.
How about a wash and wax?
Cool out.
I know that car belongs to somebody.
We'll leave it here
for you to drive over to Omar's.
And make sure he pays
for the last car we brought him.
Whassup, man?
Man, look at this thing.
I think it's got plastic spinners.
What's up with the girls here?
Damn. They look like the girls
from the "Candy Shop" videos.
They might look like 'em,
but they don't dance like 'em.
Oh, yeah? So, you been
workin' 'em out?
I been workin' 'em out.
I been givin' 'em something like...
Whassup?
That's what you showed 'em?
Hey, yo.
- OK.
- Whoo!
- That's whassup?
- And what they do?
Be like twinkle-toes.
Aah! Ha-ha!
What'd you do after that?
Can you please stop thinking about
the senior showcase for one second?
- It's not just that. It's everything...
- Nora. Nora! Look.
Got a track for the showcase. It's the same
tempo, same rhythm as the track you got,
but I really believe this'll take
your routine to the next level.
- Next level?
- Yeah.
- Thanks a lot, Miles.
- Nora, listen, wait.
- Not that it's not already at the next level...
- Quit while you're ahead. Stop.
I need you to stop and take a breath.
You're startin' to make me nervous.
- I know. I'm just stressed.
- You need a break.
Colin's playin' Saturday night.
You haven't been there forever.
- Hold on. Who's Colin?
- Lucy's older boyfriend.
- He's sophisticated. A real man.
- Sophisticated? Real man?
His butt's gonna be surrounded
by a lot of real men when he goes to jail.
How long have you had your license -
six months, seven?
I am very mature for my age.
Thank you.
That's great.
That's so perfect for the witness stand.

When are you gonna
stop changin' her music?
- I'm just tryin' to help her.
- Nora, come on.
Just go. Just go.
Please, come on.
Hey, man, what you doin'?
-  Come on, man.
- They got that.
- Tired of gettin' dogged on yet?
- Oh, yeah. Let's go.
Whassup?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Bounce!
- Throw that, Tyler!
Ha!
A'ight.
Pick 'em up,
pick 'em up.
Come on, man.
Come on.
Hey, man,
put me down.
- Come on, man.
- Ah-ha-ha!
- Get off me!
- You playin', baby?
- Go!
- Mac. Mac.
Got him. Got him! Get him.
Ohh!
Whoo!
- Put my money here, baby.
- Hey, baby. Nice game.
That's wonderful, Jack.
Congratulations.
- You're late.
- Not really.
You're so eager to get to work
you're sprinting off to the supply closet?
It's 15 minutes.
Don't I get a grace period or something?
You've neither earned one, nor are you
entitled. But you can stay 15 minutes later.
Andrew, oh, my God.
What happened?
Came down on my ankle wrong
in class today.
- Are you OK?
- Yeah. It's just a sprain.
Doctor says I have to stay off of it.
I'm really sorry.
- For what? It's not your fault.
- I know, Nora.
It's just that the showcase
means a lot to both of us.
Maybe you could find someone
to rehearse with in the meantime.
I should be back before you know it.
Yeah. Um...
Don't worry about it.
I'll be OK.
All right.
Cool. I'll see you later.
OK.
- What's up, man?
- 'Sup?
- Hey, where you from?
- I grew up in McCulloh Homes.
Oh, word.
That's where my boy Mac is from.
He lives over at Heritage now, though.
Oh, yeah?
I don't live over there no more.
I live with my aunt now.
I'll check you a little later, all right?
- A'ight.
- A'ight.
Later.
He only has a bad sprain. I need someone
to rehearse with until he gets better.
You know all the stuff
I have going on with the labels.
How come Miles
can find the time to help me?
No offense to Miles, but he's not involved
in every aspect of the music as I am.
Look, all I need is somebody, Brett,
to rehearse with just for a couple of weeks.
I wanna help you. You know I do.
I'm just so close with my music,
I gotta give it everything I have right now.
Look, you're gonna do great.
You always do.
Yeah.
All right, sweetie.
Thank you guys so much
for coming to the audition.
- Ready?
- No!
Sorry. I'm not ready yet.
Thank you.
Next?
Like this.
Jump. See?
- It's not that hard. OK?
- Yeah.
Hold me. Great.
No.
Thank you.
- No! Oh!
-
- Oh!
- I got it.
- You did it.
- No, no, no...
Thank you. Thanks.
I'll do it.
Do what?
I don't know.
Whatever y'all were tryin' to do out here.
You wanna lift me?
Are you kidding?
Does it look like I'm kiddin'?
OK, I get it. You're not gonna use me
to get out of cleaning the windows,
even if you were capable of dancing.
OK. I'm not trying to get out of anything
and I know you saw me the other day.
Thank you,
but I can find someone else.
OK.
I was just tryin' to help.
OK, wait.
Catch me.
Now what?
Um, um...
Put me down.
No. What about
choreographing a solo?
I don't have time to work out a solo.
Not a good one, anyway.
Have you talked to the sophomores?
I've auditioned a bunch of them.
None of them can handle it.
My dance has a lot of lifts in it
and you know how hard the...
- I can't believe there's no one else.
- None who have the time.
And you say that he can dance?
- He's adequate.
- Adequate?
See, that's my concern.
He's not taking this seriously.
Look, I'm sorry.
It's just you all be talkin' about dancin'
like it's rocket science or something.
It's just for a couple of weeks
until Andrew gets better.
Yeah.
This would be your risk, Nora.
It's your senior piece.
I know.
Don't make me regret my decision.
Bring your tights.
Tights? Wait, what?
-
-  Aah!
I'm gonna beat you.
Anything interesting
happen in school today?
Malcolm, enough.
No.
Sit down. Thank you.
Eat.
Mm...
Anything special at school today?
I found a rehearsal partner,
so now I won't miss a beat
when Andrew gets back.
Your applications arrived from Cornell
and Brown. I put them on your bed.
Remember our deal, Nora.
If you don't get a job from the showcase,
you go to school in the fall.
OK.
- I'm not late.
-
You're not dressed, either.
You can change in the bathroom.
Done.
- I asked you to bring tights.
- Do I look like I own tights?
- Shoes?
- Move better with 'em on.
Afraid you might slip and fall?
- How you wanna do this?
- I'll start with a combination.
OK.
Step, knee, step, fan,
step, turn, ball change, contract.
- OK?
- Mm-hm.
I'll take it slow.
And... step, knee,
step, fan, and...
- You got that?
-  Yeah.
So, from the fan...
turn, ball change, contract.
OK. Um...
Let's do it again.
Five, six, seven, eight. Step, knee...
Oh. My bad.
No. Uh, so... Go.
Step, knee, fan...
Wow.
He looks like the real deal.
- Take a break. Grab a coffee with me.
- I can't. I have a lot to do.
- That's for damn sure.
- Brett...
- I'm sorry. You got a problem?
- No. No, I'm all about rehabilitation.
- We could discuss this outside.
- Why do you think you're so tough?
- Why don't you test me?
- OK, stop.
Brett, everything's OK, all right?
I'll meet you later.
- OK.
- OK.
- What?
- Again.
And...
Yo, Omar!
Your boys are here, man!
O, look what we got for you, man.
Let's go, baby.
- I heard you havin' a party on Friday.
- Mm-hm.
- Yeah, you know we up in there.
- Uh-uh.
You dudes is froze out,
especially after what happened last time.
- What you mean, we froze out?
- I ain't start that. That was PJ.
That ain't even right.
We can take this car to Stuckey's.
Probably get more money, too.
I'm sorry. Yeah.
You could take this car to Stuckey's.
You know something, Mac? You young
dudes ain't got no respect. No loyalty.
Why don't you bring me a Escalade or
something to get back in my good graces?
- We just got you this car.
- An Escalade.
- We'll get you an Escalade.
- What did you say?
- Nothin', man.
- Yeah, nothing.
So, can I still come to the party?
-  Skinny, come on!
- He ain't say nothin' about me.
He said y'all couldn't go to the party.
He didn't say nothin' about Skinny.
Will you shut up?
Ready? Down, up, step, turn.
- Piqué and...
- What the hell is a piqué?
This is a piqué.
We do the turn
and land face to face, OK?
- I get it...
- Do it again.
- It's just...
- What?
It's just stiff.
This whole thing is stiff. It's boring.
Boring?
Don't look at me like I'm stupid.
I know you know what I'm sayin'.
Fine. Well, that's the way it is, so...
Fine.
Ready? And...
Down, up...
step, turn, piqué, and...
- Like this?
- Um...
OK, I am starving.
Tyler's just here until Andrew's back.
And why is this the first time
I'm hearin' about it?
We still have work to do.
Wait. I can't watch?
Is he that bad...?
- Goodbye.
- You can tell me!
OK.
OK, um...
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- All right. I'll see you tomorrow.
OK.
Can you come to the club
and hear me sing with Colin on Saturday?
Ooh, maybe you can bring Tyler.
Can you stop talking
about how hot he is?
OK, Brett's not around, so why do you
keep denying the obvious? It's so obvious.
OK, fine. Tyler's good looking,
but he's annoying.
See? Your guard's up,
and that must mean that you like him.
- You couldn't be more wrong.
- Ooh!
And defensive, too.
You know, that must mean that you,
um... really,  like him.
I'm just sayin'.
Look. Miles sent me another MP3.
Ugh.
Better listen to it now. He'll call
in five minutes, askin' what you think.
You've been gettin' on
Miles' case a lot lately.
Because he's irritating.
Ooh.
- Defensive. What does that mean again?
- Just listen to the track, OK?
Hm.
It's good.
Whatever.
#
#
- This.
- This is better.
#
#
#
#
#
#
#
#
#
#
#
#
#
I'm so serious.
If you don't stop laughing...
OK, no!
- Are you serious?
- Ready?
#
Whatever.
I'm sorry.
#
#
#
#
#
#
#
#
What next?
Six, seven, eight.
Piqué and grab...
#
#
Turn, down.
#
#
#
#
#
Lena got Cap'n Crunch.
Peanut butter Cap'n Crunch.
Told you she likes us.
- Camille, would you get outta here?
- Fine.
-  It's not my fault!
-  It is your fault...
Camille, come here for a second.
Shut up.
You gonna give me a little bit of that?
One bite.
One bite.
Hurry up.
- That was the biggest bite I've ever seen.
-
Get your own.
I spit on that spoon.
Yeah, now you give it back.
What... What is this?
- That's a sliding scale.
- What does that mean?
That means I scored more points than you,
so I get more money.
No, no, no.
What about my assists?
I was droppin' dimes today.
- You tripped over your own shoes.
- Twice.
You rolled out of the second one.
You played it off cool.
- You better give me some more money.
- What?
It's getting late.
I gotta bounce.
- Wait, hold on. We'll give you a ride.
- Yo, let me do it this time.
- Skinny, you the lookout.
- Why can't I do it this time?
- Can you do it?
- Yeah.
Let him do it, then.
You know what?
Here you go, tough guy.
See that car right there?
Go get 'em.
- That car has got an alarm on it.
- I know.
-
-
He failed.
Yo, I told you that alarm
was gonna go off.
Wait a minute.
Y'all set me up?
Hold up. I got us one.
You shoulda saw your face.
Tsk.
# Can't say I ever felt the way I felt
- # When we were makin'...
- # Love
# Can't stand the thought
that you were mine, but now you're...
# For the takin'
# I realize that we were one,
but now we're two
# You traded us for something
just to pass the time, babe
- That was good. Play it back, Miles?
- I like that.
Nora.
Yo, look who's here.
Sorry, bro.
Closed studio.
Yeah, OK, "bro."
- You're an hour late.
- Yeah. My bad. I got caught up.
For an hour?
Yeah. I had things I had to do.
I'm sorry. Can't we rehearse now?
No. There's other dancers
in the studio now. We can't.
Why you gettin' mad at me?
I'm here every single day.
- I said I'm sorry.
- Sorry's not gonna cut it.
Yeah, we're workin' here, man.
Some of us take this seriously.
Mm-hm.
- Where were you?
- Where was I when?
When we were supposed
to be rehearsing?
I don't think the rehearsing thing
is gonna work out for me.
- What the hell does that mean?
- That means I'm out.
What?! Are you kidding me? You just quit
without even talking to me about it?
Yeah, sorry.
Look, I gotta get back to work.
I can't believe this. I can't believe
I trusted you. That was so stupid.
People make stupid decisions every day.
Besides, it didn't look
like you needed me, anyway.
Mac, get your feet off the table.
Marcus, get your feet off my table.
- Told you, boy.
- Mom!
Don't leave this house. I don't wanna
hear about you getting into trouble.
- We ain't goin' nowhere, Mom.
- That's right.
I'll be back home in time
to make y'all's breakfast.
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye, Mrs. Carter.
Ah, man.
Look, look, weak crossover.
- You think you're as good as these guys?
- Please.
Why don't you try out?
- For the And1 team?
- Mm-hm.
- Why would I need to do that for?
- You should play for the school team.
The school team?
- Yeah, right. They suck. Never.
- Maybe they wouldn't suck if you played.
Is this part of your community service?
What you gonna say next? "This is your
brain on drugs"? Man, forget with that.
- I'm just sayin'...
- All right, man. Just drop it.
Don't see you out tryin' to do nothin'.
You quit everything you start. You know it.
-  That's me right there.
- Put it in slow motion, too.
Oh, baby...
Nora?
Where have you been?
It's getting late.
Where do you think, Mom?
You've been rehearsing a lot.
What about your schoolwork?
Rehearsing is the most important part of
my schoolwork. It's kind of the whole point.
Sweetie, I just don't think that dancing...
Dancing is what?
What do you know about it?
When was the last time
you saw me dance?
That's not fair.
You don't have to worry about it anymore.
The guy I've rehearsed with
for the showcase quit today.
So basically, I'm screwed.
You might get your dream after all.
You gotta come to rehearsal.
Nora.
Wait a minute.
Can you hold on a second?
Look, I just wanted to say
I'm sorry about yesterday.
- You don't feel like mopping floors today?
- Look, can you just give me a break?
Do you have any idea how important this
showcase is? Who's going to be there?
- I don't know. People?
- People?
Important people from every
major dance company in the country.
Without this showcase,
I have nothing. I go nowhere.
OK. All right, I get it.
I know all about havin' nothin'. It sucks.
- It does.
- So are we gonna go back to doin' this?
- No.
- No?
- I don't trust you.
- What do I gotta do to prove it to you?
Look, I'll do anything.
Anything?
And up and grand plié
all the way to the ground.
Back up and reach your arm up high.
Touch the sky.
Down forward, touch your toes.
And back up.
Shh!
And pointe and second.
And plié...
Good. Plié...
-
- Shh!
I thought she was gonna
slap me in my face.
Well, this is me.
OK. Why are you teachin' ballet class?
It doesn't look like you need a job.
Oh, you know, it just puts off
coming home a little longer.
It couldn't be that bad.
My mom doesn't get
the whole dancing thing.
- What about your dad?
- He died a couple years ago.
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's OK.
He was the one
who always encouraged me.
Driving me to rehearsals,
watching all my routines.
Sounds like a cool dude.
- Thanks for walking me home.
- All right. Later.
Bye.
Pickup game tomorrow at the courts.
Them cats want a rematch. You down?
I can't make that. I got community service
every day this week, man.
Hey, put that away.
What are you doin'?
Whassup between you and Lucy?
Look like she's kind of feeling you.
- I don't know about that.
- What, you scared?
Luce, Colin is too old for you.
What are you doing?
- It was so...
- Cheesy?
Romantic, OK?
It was romantic...
- Why isn't Nora using this?
- Nora's old-school, man.
I ain't talkin' Sugarhill Gang.
I'm talkin' 'bout Vivaldi old-school. For real.
You should let her listen to it.
Hey, Nora. I want you to hear somethin'.
- Don't start.
- You guys seem to be gettin' along well.
- He's my partner.
- Ah, he's just your partner.
And too many things.
Miles got... What's that, violin?
Some kids to play violin on the track.
Finally working with people
that can play instruments.
I can play, all right.
I just prefer to play with myself.
Whoa. What?
- He makes it too easy.
- No, not play with...
Just listen.
I like it.
I really like it. It's good.
Told you, dawg.
Hey, I was thinkin', um...
You know that turn
where we have our legs behind us?
Thinkin', you know,
what if I went down,
and then we, like,
change levels, like?
I just... I don't mean to be out of line...
No, no. It's cool.
I like it.
Let's try it. Ready?
Five, six, seven, eight.
One, two, three, four.
- That's actually really good.
- Cool.
I think we should do it.
Let's try it again.
Five, six, seven, eight.
I guess I'll just see you tomorrow, then.
- OK.
- All right.
You need a ride?
Um...
You ever even been out to Hampden?
No, but there's a place I go near there.
I'm serious.
Where are you takin' me?
Hold on.
I'm about to show you.
Hold it. Is this...
Is this where you kill me?
Funny.
This is it.
Yeah. I mean...
I got a view just like this,
you know, from my balcony.
- You do?
- No.
- How did you find this place?
- I been comin' here since I was a kid.
My dad was an executive
at one of the shipping companies.
This is where
I imagined my whole routine.
I don't know how you do it.
How you think about
how two people are gonna move and...
I don't know, every detail.
I couldn't do that.
- You've been doing it.
- It's not the same thing, though.
That's how it starts.
I always saw this routine
with a bunch of other dancers.
What do you mean?
Well, if I had enough dancers,
I could have them all starting in unison
and then slowly
breaking out in a canon.
Whoa, what's...
- What's a canon?
- You know, like "Row Your Boat"?
OK, I'll show you. You know
that phrase with the turn and lift?
They all have turn and lifts.
All right, what, in the middle section?
Yeah, I know it.
Instead of doing it together,
you're gonna go first.
- Come on.
- All right.
OK, go on "one."
Five, six, seven, eight.
