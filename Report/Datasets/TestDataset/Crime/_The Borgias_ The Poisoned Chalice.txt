...qui te custodiat
ab hoste maligno,
et perducat in vitam aeternam.
Amen.
Asperges me, Domine, hyssopo,
et mundabor: lavabis me,
et super nivem dealbabor.
: You are afraid
to enter, but you must.
- ...secundum multitudinem...
- : I am about to meet my maker.
I have confessed.
And I...
confess...
I am very afraid.
Colonna.
Sforza. Orsini.
Borgia.
- Your Holiness.
- Della Rovere.
...Gloria Patri...
You will fight like dogs
over this corpse I leave
for this throne
of St. Peter's.
But it was pure once.
We have all sullied it
with our greed
and lechery.
Which of you...
will wash it clean?
It shall be cleansed,
Your Holiness,
with the tears we shed for you.
I swear before the Living God.
You swear thus?
A Spanish murrano? A white moor?
- As Vice-Chancellor,
I swear before the Living d.
- And so do I, Your Holiness.
- And I, Your Holiness. - And I.
Rest assured, Your Holiness.
The glory of our Holy Mother
Church will be restored in my lifetime.
: Please...
...God.
There's a door behind...
leads to the street.
The back passage?
- You're a cleric?
- Didn't you notice?
There was nothing
ecclesiastical about you
- last night.
- By night...
By night I am who I want to be.
By day, I am thus.
Lucrezia!
- Sister!
- I spied a lady... another one!
There's a punishment for spying.
- What's that?
- Oh, I think you know!
No!
Can I come to your wedding?
I'll never have a wedding,
you know that.
No. You are betrothed to God.
Don't you love God, Cesare?
More than I love you?
Don't be sad, brother.
Maybe Papa will become pope,
and you can be
who you want to be.
If he does become pope,
I'll be what he wants me to be.
Can a pope have children, Cesare?
I've heard it rumoured
that Pope Innocent has 12.
But I have also heard
it rumoured that he is dying.
No news in that.
He's been dying for weeks now.
If he does die,
will our father wear his crown?
The new pope will be elected
by the College of Cardinals, my love.
And only God can
predict the outcome.
Well, since
you will have no wedding,
I will pray for God
to choose Papa.
I want to wear a beautiful white veil
crowned with pearls for his coronation.
God may need some help, then.
- What have they heard?
- The pope breathes his last.
God rest his soul...
We must get you out of here
before they lock the doors.
- And so it begins.
- You know what to do?
- Yes, Father.
- Keep our family safe.
Until the new pope is elected,
it will be anarchy in Rome...
every faction fighting
for its own candidate.
And if... after the first vote...
if the smoke is black...
As you said, Father,
I know what to do.
: I have waited
a lifetime for this moment.
We will go over it again.
If we fail at the first vote,
I will send word...
On the wings of a dove...
...names of those cardinals
who need persuading.
With properties, benefices,
and, if need be, gold.
They call it simony, Father.
God will forgive us, my son.
But I will not forgive failure...
...from you
or your brother.
Am I understood?
We will not fail you, Father.
Mm.
Go now.
Back to Spain, Borgia!
You've had your day in Rome.
- You can't wring any more favours
from a dead pope. - I was born here,
- as far as I'm aware.
- If a pig is born
in a stable, does that make him a horse?
Tsk, tsk, tsk!
Rome is for Romans now.
The new pope will see to that.
And if the new pope is Spanish?
And if my mother's
the Virgin Mary?
Was the Virgin a Roman whore?
That's news to me.
Excuse me.
- Ah!
- Ah...
My brother speaks
before he thinks.
He begs your pardon.
- I should have let them do it.
- Kill me? Your younger brother?
Our father would
never have forgiven you.
Have you heard?
: Even Gioffre has
heard. Have you not?
- : The pope has died.
- You know what that means?
I know there will be an election.
And the city will be bedlam
until it's over.
: Do you think
our father can win, Juan?
: Are we allowed
to dream, Mother?
Your father found ways to love and care
for us in this house, but I'm not sure
- as pope he can do the same.
- As pope, he can do what he wants.
Are you sure?
Kings and popes and emperors
belong to their peoples,
not to their families.
So, we allow the election
to run its course,
- and he won't be pope.
- What other course is there?
- It's in the hands of God.
- It's in the hands
of the College of Cardinals, Mother.
It's not quite the same thing.
This one.
- Cardinal Borgia.
- My Lord Cardinal.
- Whoever wins this contest...
- Election.
If you were a different man...
...I might vote
for you.
You've performed your duties
as Vice-Chancellor admirably.
The Church has need of your...
...organizational
genius.
But...
She has other needs as well.
And they would be?
Honesty.
Probity.
Goodness.
You find me lacking
in those qualities?
Yes.
And so I shall fight you.
To the end, and beyond that, if need
be, with any means at my disposal.
I do tend to win
whatever battles I fight.
But what talk we of fighting?
It is all in God's hands.
Good night, My Lord.
To Cardinal Rodrigo Borgia,
four votes.
To Cardinal Ascanio Sforza,
six votes.
To Cardinal Guilliano
Della Rovere,
seven votes.
To Cardinal Orsino Orsini,
six votes.
None has the require majority...
Dominus Deum...
After the death of Pope Sixtus,
- they holed us up here for a month...
- Appalling.
The company was tolerable,
but as for the food...
I had to lead the revolt...
insist our dishes could be
brought in from outside.
How wise.
And now there's crystal
in my soup.
Please,
have mine, Your Grace.
Oh.
Don't drink this.
It's vinegar; I've tasted it.
: From my vineyards
in Valencia.
How can I thank you?
Hmm...
I wonder...
Mmm!
...est a me...
The rules are clear.
No outside contact is
permitted under any circumstance.
But you must know that
Cardinal Versucci's digestion is
- very delicate.
- Which is why he has rabbit baked in milk.
Ah.
Good.
And...
Cardinal Piccolomini...
Uh...
Suckling pig with rosemary.
- Indeed. The well-being
of the curia...
...is of the greatest
importance. As Vice-Chancellor,
their health is my concern.
Mens sana in corpore sano.
I think St. Augustine might
disagree with you. He extolled
- the virtues of fasting.
- St. Augustine...
...never had to vote
in conclave.
My dear sons,
the Cardinals Versucci,
Piccolomini, and Sanso,
grant some titles
and benefices
from the Borgia abbeys,
monasteries, and bishoprics.
: ...Versucci,
Piccolomini, and Sanso,
grant some titles and benefices
from the Borgia abbeys,
monasteries, and bishoprics.
Julius... Versucci...
All rights to the Abbey of...
...St. Catherine
of Siena.
Cardinal Allesandro Piccolomini.
Suckling pig
for the cardinal, roasted.
Roasted and...
...stuffed.
- Cardinal Julius Versucci.
- Uh, rabbit.
Rabbit...
...baked in milk.
Tasty.
Cardinal Giuliano Della Rovere...
...has garnered ten votes.
Cardinal Ascanio Sforza, five.
Cardinal Rodrigo Borgia has
garnered eight votes.
But none has the required
majority.
: My dear son,
we are in sight of our goal,
but now you must redouble
our efforts.
Send your brother
round the Borgia churches
to empty them of gold, ornaments,
and precious stone.
I have emptied the churches
of the Romagna.
I have stripped altars bare.
They were rotten
with gold ornament.
Yes, you are
a true reformer, brother.
These cardinals know no vows
of poverty.
: Why the dove,
Cesare?
It has a dual purpose, my love.
Like many things in life,
it serves as both a symbol
and a messenger.
- A symbol of what?
- Of the uncorrupted soul.
And a messenger of what?
Of corruption.
You mean to say it bears news
of how many votes
we must buy
in the Papal election.
You are criminally
well informed, sis.
But I trust your soul is still
of the purest white.
How many votes
must we buy him, Cesare?
You know too much already,
don't you?
You're wrong.
I know too little...
: Dear Father,
nine mules laden down
with gold and treasure are being
distributed
to the palaces
of the following cardinals:
Cardinal Giuliano Della Rovere
has garnered...
...Cardinal Ascana Sforza has
garnered four...
...Cardinal Rodrigo Borgia has
garnered ten votes.
None has the required majority.
Of course, Cardinal Sforza,
the entire conclave knows
that I cannot be both
Vice-Chancellor
and pope of Rome.
- Than you can no longer be
a Vice-Chancellor.
You mean...
...I may yet be
pope of Rome?
- If you can find
a suitable Vice-Chancellor.
And how would you describe
the qualities necessary
for a suitable Vice-Chancellor,
Cardinal Sforza?
- Discretion.
- Mm-hmm.
Loyalty.
And a certain kind of wisdom.
Can you be more specific?
I would say
the one who would be suitable
as Vice-Chancellor would be wise to support
the Vice-Chancellor who would be pope.
Hmm.
And I would say...
...we have an understanding.
Cardinal Giuliano Della Rovere
has garnered seven votes.
Cardinal Alberto Colonna, two.
Cardinal Rodrigo Borgia...
...fourteen.
Cardinal Borgia has
the required majority.
Correction:
Cardinal Borgia has bought
the required majority.
What is your implication?
His implication is that
the throne of St. Peter's is
- for sale.
- And has been bought
by a Spaniard
up to his elbows in simony.
I see.
You would prefer it had been
bought by an Italian?
By someone remotely worthy
of the papacy at least...
Then my first act
as pope will be to institute
an inquiry
into the elective process.
My second, of course...
...will be to appoint
a Vice-Chancellor...
the greatest office,
with the greatest income,
in my gift.
Now, there are
two obvious choices:
Cardinals Della Rovere
and Orsini.
But the pope could
not possibly appoint one
who questioned his right
to be pope.
That was not my intention.
Nor was it mine.
I see.
And the Spanish race is closest
to your bosom.
- Can we proceed, then?
- To conclude:
Cardinal Borgia has the required
majority.
An examination, testes
et pendentes, is required.
And Cardinal Borgia is happy
to comply.
Can there be any doubt
that the good cardinal is male?
Not if we count his children.
Let him without children cast
the first stone.
I have heard rumours...
- ...of a rhinoceros horn.
- Ooh, that small?
Boasting again?
Oh, go on.
The suspense is killing them.
Habet duos testiculos...
...et bene pendentes.
So, he's got two testicles,
well hung.
Deo gracias.
Habemus papam!
: Pater, et filius,
et Spiritus Sanctus.
Amen.
...tu es et dominus eternum...
...et Spiritus Sancti.
Amen.
Oh!
Your sins are all forgiven,
sisters.
By the pope's bastard?
Son!
His favourite son!
: I ask to confess
to you, Holy Father,
because...
I have sinned.
How have you sinned, my son?
I have corrupted my soul.
I have pledged estates, castles,
benefices
to your brother cardinals.
I have transferred the documents in the
innards of roasted beasts and fowls.
All to secure
your election as pope.
And God will repay us tenfold.
But you must set my soul
at ease, Father.
Can a family such as ours
survive such a prize?
We are Spaniards.
They hate us.
The enemies we have at present
will be multiplied tenfold.
God will protect his Vicar
on Earth, Cesare,
- and those dearest to him. - And will you
inform God as to His duties in this regard?
Why this blasphemous tone,
my son?
Because I swear, if God
does not protect us, I shall.
You are a bishop, Cesare.
You have no need of such temporal thoughts.
You placed this collar
round my neck, Father.
You made God my calling.
But the sins I've committed for
you must convince you, surely,
that the Church is
not my calling.
I beg you now to release me of my vows.
Let me live as a layman.
As a soldier.
I can then protect our family from the
storm that surely must engulf it.
You are my eldest son, Cesare. You were
always destined to be a prince of the Church.
I would be a prince of state,
Father, and I think you know that.
The papal army is small, Cesare.
The battles I will fight will be
within these sacred walls.
This is where I will need
your help. Juan can...
...bear arms for the Borgia family, and
lead whatever army the pope has,
and I will not have my authority
questioned further on this.
Ego te absolvo ab omnibus
censuris, et peccatis,
in nomine Patris, et Filii,
et Spiritus Sancti. Amen.
You think it fits me, brother?
You have broad shoulders.
As have you.
Though it lacks an insignia.
I thought a cape
to cover the breastplate,
with the Borgia Bull
in bright yellow.
I favour black, myself.
Black for the cleric,
but for the soldier,
a prancing bull in yellow.
Or red, perhaps?
Black.
It suits you.
- Welcome, Papa.
- Oh, I've missed you.
- : So, you have won.
- Yes, I've won.
You've won
what you always wanted.
My congratulations.
And I have...
lost.
- But what have you lost, my love?
- You.
You'll never lose me.
In spirit, maybe, but...
in the flesh, I may have to.
The pope cannot love?
The pope can love God.
But to be seen
to love anyone else would be...
...unthinkable.
So we'll find ways
to accommodate our affections.
Something like we've always done.
All of Rome knows you're
the mother to my children.
Not only must the pope be chaste;
he must be seen to be chaste.
The children.
You can be seen to love them, no?
Of course!
I always knew
this day would come.
As long as you are with me
in spirit...
- I always will be.
- And with no one else.
That is equally impossible,
Vannozza.
So we take vows of chastity
along with your new status?
Must we take vows of poverty too?
Poverty?
God forbid!
For the ceremonial processions,
horses, arms and livery
for 700 priests and 23 cardinals
with their retinues,
knights, and grandees.
For Pope Alexander,
a ceremonial throne
constructed by Florentine
master builders,
gold and silver plated.
For the Borgia family,
a brocaded carriage, gold inlaid,
refurbished in Venice.
You look beautiful, Mother.
But you must try to remember
you're not in mourning.
But perhaps I am.
Like you are losing your family?
The life we have lived.
What are we gaining?
The future.
d
Step! Step!
Take the tiara...
...which is ornamented
with three crowns...
...and be aware...
that you are father
of kings and monarchs,
lord of the globe,
earthly resident
of our Lord Jesus Christ,
our Redeemer,
who shall have the power
and the glory forever and ever.
Amen.
His Holiness,
Pope...
...Alexander Sixtus.
That is so many titles, Cesare.
What will his family
call him now?
Holy Father.
Holy Father.
That's easy.
Even I can remember that.
...grants to all faithful
here present
a plenary indulgence...
- And tell me, dear brother...
- What, sis?
What must I call myself?
Holy Daughter?
You are still
Lucrezia Borgia, my love.
You will only change your name
when you marry.
- And when will I marry?
- Never, if I can help it.
But surely it is good
to marry, Cesare?
As the pope's daughter,
you will have every prince
of Europe vying for your hand.
They may care very little
for your heart.
Perhaps I should do
as you have done, brother...
take Holy Orders.
Give my heart to God.
That might be
the safer option, my love.
Does Papa have so many enemies?
As our father, perhaps not.
But as pope...
I am Rodrigo Borgia no longer.
I am Alexander Sixtus.
But you know who you are.
My father, still.
I am no longer "I".
I am... "we".
We felt so...
alone out there.
When the crown touched our head.
Humbled, even.
- Even frightened.
- You surprise me, Father.
You would surprise yourself if such
destiny ever brushed against you.
Quite alone...
...with just the...
...silence of God...
...as your witness.
But He must already be
pleased, Holy Father.
Ahhh!
Indeed?
Why?
Because the earth has
not yet swallowed us.
Here we are.
You must help me, Cesare.
You must help me interpret...
...the great silence
of God.
: Wait!
Let me!
- Come.
- Help me... do His will.
We have been entrusted...
...with the keys
to His kingdom.
The King of France must be
aware, Ambassador,
that we have placed the papal
mitre in the hands of an ape.
He has hopes, Cardinal, that the
office brings its own grace with it,
and that the grace of God can
transform the worst of men.
And if it doesn't?
We will observe with interest
what harm a mitred ape can do.
Hm.
These offices we grant
in the full expectation
they will be used wisely
for the restoration
of the honour
of our Holy Mother Church.
Dominus vobiscum.
- : Dominus vobiscum.
- And, finally,
the greatest office in our gift,
the post of Vice-Chancellor,
the office that stands
a reed's width
from our papacy.
We grant...
...the most august,
the most valued colleague,
the brightest hope
for the future of the Church,
Cardinal...
...Ascanio Sforza.
Simony!
I charge you now in public
with trading sacred offices
like a market huckster!
May I remind the cardinal
he is in consistry.
Perhaps we misheard him.
That office was promised to me.
Ah.
Did you pay for it?
With my acceptance
of your foul election.
When the pope pledges
to banish all suspicion
of simony from the cardinalate,
he keeps his word.
God has chosen us as a new broom
to sweep the Vatican clean
of corruption, which is
precisely why we choose one
who has no expectation
of advancement...
Cardinal Sforza.
And I pray I may prove worthy
of the honour.
And I pray so too.
In fact,
I fully approve
of his new... broom.
Kiss the ring, you fool.
As do I.
And I deeply regret
my recent intemperance.
In honour of his appointment,
I invite Cardinal Sforza,
and Your Holiness
and the College of Cardinals
to a banquet at my palace
in two days' time.
Are you going
to share it with me?
Share what, Holy Father?
Why you bring a monkey
to a banquet?
Oh, I fear the other cardinals might not
share your appetite for reformation.
And your monkey does?
Why, yes. He is an excellent
judge of appetite.
Huh!
Reform to our Holy Mother Church
may happen slowly, but...
God has spoken to me as he spoke
to my predecessor, Pope Innocent.
Happen it must.
Shall we dine on gruel
tonight, then, Your Holiness?
- I could inform my cooks. - We are your guests
tonight, My Lord Cardinal. We will dine
according to your choosing.
Thank goodness.
I can have the wine poured?
Let me taste that.
It is of an excellent vintage,
My Lord.
I have no doubt.
Oh!
And how is his palate?
Well, it's superb.
- He salutes your good taste.
- Thank you.
A great wine,
like the papacy itself...
mature, rounded,
its roots in the soil,
its bouquet in the heavens,
consumed by a monkey.
I suspect a metaphor is
lurking there, My Lord Cardinal?
We are but animals
blessed with an eternal soul.
There go we,
but for the grace of God.
: It seems nature,
not metaphor, calls.
He begs Your Lordship's pardon.
Excuse me.
Excuse my monkey.
Why such a hurry?
- My God, you're fast.
- For a cook.
And you for a cleric.
On kitchen duty?
For tonight.
- Who pays you?
- Cardinal Orsini.
Whatever you're being paid,
I'll double it.
- I could use someone that fast.
- You could?
Oh, yeah.
But not that stupid!
Far from stupidity, sire.
I imagine from your offer
that you have need of me, yes?
So to kill the servant you have
need of would indeed be stupid.
Call me stupid, then.
Tell me, tell me why I shouldn't. Hmm?
Because of the sixth commandment,
thou shalt not kill.
I'll be forgiven.
The pope is my confessor.
Because you'll never meet
another assassin like me.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
- But we were talking terms, yes?
- We were.
I would gladly work
for the pope or the pope's son,
for these cardinals can,
as you know, prove fickle,
and it seems
someone as pitiless as you...
- Yes?
- Needs someone as pitiless as me.
Elaborate.
I have smothered infants
in their beds.
But only
when their parents paid me.
And in the powder?
Eternal life.
- For whom?
- You. Your father.
It's not very subtle.
No subtlety needed tonight.
They all want you dead.
Serve this...
...to Orsini.
Your Grace.
You are bleeding.
Damned monkey bit me.
Animals will do that.
They lack soul.
I propose a toast.
To harmony,
amongst us,
servants of God.
- Harmony. - To the communion of saints
and the forgiveness of sins.
Amen.
Amen.
I'd like to propose
a second toast. To metaphor.
- : Why metaphor?
- Because she's so
infinitely pliable. A prince
one minute, a monkey the next.
And what her hidden meaning is only
God in His infinite wisdom knows.
I propose another toast.
- To monkeys.
- Monkeys?
They lick your hand one minute,
bite your neck the next. And everyone knows
what you do with the monkey that bites you.
And what do you do
with the monkey that bites you?
Your Eminence, you're ill.
You wring its neck.
- : Poison.
- Poison!
I accuse!
The cooks?
Come, Father.
: Send for help!
- The poison was meant for us.
- That's not possible.
We were saved by a monkey,
Father.
You don't poison the pope!
Are you aware
what the gossips call you?
The mitred ape. Half of Rome was
waiting to celebrate this outcome...
You poison a rat,
you poison a rabid dog!
Not the Vicar of Rome,
not the heir to St. Peter!
- : Bring my carriage!
- The idea offends you?
It offends me, it offends
nature, it offends God Himself!
- So, God will take His revenge, then.
- Yes, He will. With our help.
- Go!
- : Yah!
Excellent service.
- I fear it is not over yet.
- What do you mean?
Well, there's more to your Borgia
family than father and son.
- What do you mean?
- I mean we must hurry, My Lord.
Your whole family's in danger.
- Micheletto!
- Am I too late?
- We were waiting for you.
- Then you're too late!
What are you doing?!
Ah!
Allow me, My Lord.
Guards!
- : General!
- With me, quickly!
Come on!
Get out of my way!
Pray somewhere else, Cardinals.
Arrest this household.
You planned this massacre
thoroughly.
If I had planned it, My Lord,
believe me, we would not be
having this conversation.
You're that meticulous?
Always.
And o planned it?
Cardinal Orsini.
And Della Rovere?
I know nothing of him.
In this affair,
I had but one master.
And now?
And now I am like a stray dog,
masterless.
Unless your kind offer
still stands.
You could have...
let things take their course...
Betrayed me.
- Most of your kind do.
- My kind?
I do not have a kind.
And I suspect neither do you.
Your name, sweet assassin.
Micheletto.
You must prove yourself
worthy of my trust, th.
- This is not proof enough?
- Perhaps. Perhaps not.
- Can you dispose of these corpses?
- You would keep them secret?
More than that.
I would keep you secret.
Dump them in the Tiber.
Meet me by the Vatican gates
in two hours' time. We shall
discuss your future service.
: Mother.
Are you trying to frighten me?
I'm sorry, Mother.
Why are you here, Cesare?
I imagine things...
murders,
blood-spattered throats,
poisoned chalices.
Perhaps you're not wrong.
We have many enemies now.
And Lucrezia?
She's sleeping.
You miss her that much?
Always.
If anything happened
to her, I'd...
...I'd die.
What could possibly happen?
I'm putting a guard on the house.
Is it so dangerous outside?
We are in a different city now.
Is it still called Rome?
I'm not sure it has a name.
Father.
Father!
Father, I've had to place
a guard on the...
The good cardinal, my son,
has been expressing his shock
and dismay
at this evening's outcome.
Poison, it seems, was the cause
of Cardinal Orsini's demise.
One shudders at the thought.
As to who poisoned him,
I have no idea.
Perhaps we should
ask ourselves, who benefits most
from his death?
And what are you implying,
Your Eminence?
I am implying nothing.
I am merely offering
His Holiness any help I can
in unmasking the culprit.
Our Holy Mother Church can
afford no such scandals.
We have Orsini's household
staff in irons, Your Holiness.
- Cardinal.
- The good cardinal, my brother,
has offered to help us unmask
the culprit behind this plot.
We apprehended this wretch
skulking outside by the gate.
A plot, by definition,
needs more than one participant,
- does it not?
- Do you recognize him?
Didn't he pour the wine?
: Do you know
this man, Cardinal Della Rovere?
I know he attended
at the cardinal's table,
but there were many of those.
Beyond that, nothing.
If this creature is
indeed the poisoner,
some hours on the strappado
should loosen his tongue.
See if he talks.
I have a dilemma:
whether to flay you at night...
...or at dawn.
- I pity you your dilemma, My Lord.
- Pity yourself.
Brother. You have
already exhausted yourself
in our father's defence.
Now I could spend a good hour
questioning this man.
Is that really a task
for a cleric?
Lock the door and go.
Up.
Up!
Would you have talked?
Only to sing your praises,
My Lord.
Still want to earn my trust?
Eternally, My Lord.
Lie low for a day, then.
I can have word sent out
that you couldn't be broken.
And then?
Then...
...get close to Cardinal
Della Rovere.
Tell me what he thinks.
What he plans.
Then you must hurt me, My Lord.
Haven't I hurt you
enough already?
To convince this cardinal,
my back must tell its own story.
And I have heard
that he has an interest
in the male torso.
And even I cannot
convincingly whip myself.
So whip me, My Lord.
Harder.
Harder, My Lord.
And...
...if you betray me...
...you will end your days
on that rack.
Then it would not be
in my interest to betray you,
- My Lord.
- Good.
Again!
Again.
Do you have something to tell me?
About the night's events?
Only that...
...I will protect you.
Protect our family.
With my life if needs be.
Well, all of the others bought
and sold.
We merely proved ourselves
better at the game.
But we draw the line
at murder, do we not?
Orsini drew no such line.
I see.
So,
we are one less cardinal
this morning.
I was your age
when I became a cardinal.
Seems like yesterday.
This red...
...signifies that you are ready
to spill your blood in defence
of the Christian faith.
- No, Father.
- Are you, my son, ready
to spill your blood in defence
of the Christian faith?
I think you are!
For the defence
of my family, perhaps.
- That too.
- Give me control
- of the papal armies and I will protect
us all. - We will have one son
in the cloth and one in armour.
- You know our wishes.
- But a cardinal's red?
And Lucrezia must marry.
So soon?
- She is 14 years old.
- She is just a child.
We must bind our enemies
to us. Make friends of them.
And what better way is there
than marriage?
You can perform the rite...
as cardinal.
Am I a cardinal already?
And they tortured you for...
...how long?
A day and a night, Your Eminence.
And you revealed?
There was nothing to reveal,
Your Eminence.
Ecce homo.
"Behold the man."
They scourged our saviour thus.
Is it true,
what's being rumoured?
That the good cardinal
inadvertently poisoned himself?
Who would have profited
from his death?
Certainly not Cardinal Orsini.
- Who takes possession of his properties?
- Borgia.
Well, then.
These methods are not mine.
You think they are mine,
Your Eminence?
What are your methods?
Discretion.
Silence.
And you have suffered
for your silence.
Why?
Like you,
I hate this Borgia.
And if I can be of any use...
I need someone I can trust.
You can trust my hatred
of this Borgia pope.
I can trust these wounds
of yours.
They will last for a lifetime,
- Your Eminence.
- Indeed.
I need to assemble a gathering
of every cardinal
who shares your feelings.
In absolute secrecy.
May I thank you, Holy Father,
for bequeathing to me your precious time.
Go on, my child.
I have sinned mightily,
Your Holiness,
and know there are some sins
that only the pope can forgive.
They are few,
but the most grave.
Tell me.
My husband, Your Holiness,
has long been...
...distasteful to me.
I fear...
...you are not the first woman
to share that fate.
His person I find repellent.
His advances sicken me.
His hand upon my body makes me
retch with disgust.
Have you denied him...
...your duties as a wife?
No, Your Holiness.
I performed them
as the Church says I must.
So I...
...fail
to discern the sin.
I found myself with child.
The thought of this body of mine,
marred by the presence
of his offspring...
inside...
drove me to an act
of transgression that...
Go on, my daughter.
I put an end to my pregnancy.
That is indeed most grave.
A sin...
...that only
the pope...
...can forgive.
Only God may forgive.
But we may intercede...
...on your behalf.
Then, please, Your Holiness,
...beg for me His mercy.
And...
...your husband?
He knows of this?
He knows nothing.
He has retired to his castle
in Bassano.
He satisfies his lust on me
no longer.
And you are...
now... chaste?
I have no one, Your Holiness.
Then perhaps
that is to be your penitence...
to follow your husband
to Bassano, as is your duty.
I would prefer a life
of destitution, Your Holiness.
Then love God.
And find peace
within the walls of a nunnery.
Can one find peace
in such a love, Your Holiness?
It is what we must do,
Giulia Farnese.
I fear
I may lack Your Holiness's will.
I am still young, Your Holiness,
and my body, I am sure,
could find, and give,
much happiness
if my soul could find peace.
Do you beg forgiveness from God
for the enormity of your crime?
I do so daily.
Your Holiness, my soul yearns
for its punishment.
Then you must fast.
From matins till evensong.
And flagellate your naked body
twice nightly.
With knotted cord,
- Your Holiness?
- Cord of silk will suffice.
To destroy the beauty
the Lord has granted you
would be to compound your sin.
E go te absolve...
...ab omnibus censuris,
et peccatis,
in nomine Patris,
et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti.
- Amen.
- Amen.
Giulia Farnese.
Your Holiness?
One of your lineage...
...to be destitute...
we cannot allow it.
We must find you...
some...
...temporary and...
...temporal refuge.
: Keep the fire
away from the straw!
- : It is!
- : Good!
- : Boy, keep the banners and colours
all together. - : Right, sir!
Some of you voted for him,
for which unfortunate choice
you are now forgiven.
But most of you voted against.
We have assembled the barest
of majorities.
But then,
this Borgia pope was elected
with just such a majority.
The cardinal's demise was...
sudden.
So it seems.
But his palace is ideal as a...
...place
of penitence...
...and...
...self-reflection.
: If it can be proven,
what many of us suspect...
corruption, simony,
the blatant sale
of the sacred offices,
and worse, the utter degradation
of the office of the papacy
in the eyes
of the Christian world...
: You must think
of your sojourn here
as a retreat.
A retreat?
The cardinal had this tunnel
built.
It leads
inside the Vatican walls.
If you ever find yourself
in need of...
...spiritual comfort..
...in your loneliness...
Your Holiness.
You must not be afraid
to avail of it.
Day or night.
We shall leave you now.
This passage goes both ways.
Your Holiness must feel
free to visit...
...if God's love were ever
to leave him wanting.
The cardinal summons me in the dead
of night. Is there a reason?
These are turbulent times,
Father.
Dottore...
You can leave us now.
I need advice, dottore,
on a delicate matter.
The deposition of a pope.
Delicate indeed.
And, if I may say so, dangerous.
Stop that.
You have done penance enough.
Who then will forgive us,
Your Holiness?
God will.
Huggucio of Pisa states:
"Ecce publico fornicator,
publico habet concubinem..."
The pope who publicly fornicates,
publicly keeps a concubine...
Can indeed be deposed,
because to scandalize the Church
is in itself heresy.
But one would need firm evidence
of notorious and public lechery.
Whose bed is this?
Yours, of course.
Whose bed was this?
It belonged to a cardinal
and a fool.
What kind of fool?
The kind of fool
who doesn't understand that
God's work can be done
even by the most unlikely
of his servants.
- And that Rome needs now is...
- You.
Power.
You're so beautiful,
Giulia Farnese.
I would have you painted.
- She is beautiful.
- She is.
More beautiful
than your painting.
- I've just begun.
- You must do better, then.
Her hair curls, here.
Who is she?
Giulia Farnese.
At your service.
Why is he painting you,
Giulia Farnese?
Your father, the pope,
commissioned him.
Will he paint one of me?
I will commission him, now.
Why are you holding a baby goat?
It will become a unicorn.
Then I want a unicorn.
Or even better, a sea horse.
I want to lie on a bed of seashells
and have a sea horse in my lap.
: Like this one?
Yes.
Just like this one.
You must have it, then.
I can?
It's a gift.
From Giulia to Lucrezia.
- Can I kiss you, then?
- Only if we are to be friends.
We are friends already.
I am to have
my portrait painted, Mama.
- You are?
- But I don't want a goat,
or a unicorn. I told Giulia I
want a sea horse like this one.
- You told who?
- Giulia Farnese.
Giulia Farnese is having
her portrait painted?
By Pinturicchio.
Papa commissioned him.
Ah.
She gave me this pendant.
I think a sea horse is better
than a unicorn, don't you Mama?
I've heard she is beautiful,
this Giulia Farnese.
- Papa thinks so.
- I am sure he does.
A different type of beauty
to yours, Mama.
Not Spanish.
Italian.
Her hair is light,
and full of curls.
And where did you meet her,
Lucrezia?
In Papa's rooms.
In the Vatican.
- : Please, My Lady!
- : Your Holiness!
My dear.
You told me
that the pope can love God,
but to be seen
to love anyone else
- would be impossible.
- Your Holiness...
- Now, now...
- Shall we remove ourselves?
That the pope must be chaste,
and he must be seen to be chaste.
Don't you want them to hear?
That you have a new whore?!
- Mother!
- Farnese!
- Get out!
- That you've installed her
- in the Orsini Palace?
- What?
- We were...
- Be gone!
I banished my husband
for your sake!
You are the mother of my children! You will
always have a special place in my life.
- What about your promise?!
- There is no one...
...no one,
closer to me than you.
Why her?!
She was in need!
I had to help her.
You were destitute once!
: Be gone!
Out!
: We were
in consultation...
: Your Grace,
are leaving.
Don't lie to me.
To me, you cannot lie.
Then don't challenge me.
And never, ever
within these sacred walls.
I've dreamed about this room
and what it might do to you.
We need
a new understanding, then.
Perhaps.
I'll keep my peace.
But I won't be humiliated.
I would have peace.
You commissioned a portrait
of her.
I shall have a portrait too
by the same new genius you found.
Pinturicchio.
He is good, but he's...
...expensive.
All of Rome is yours
for the taking.
Make sure he does me justice.
I was beautiful once, no?
You still are.
We agreed, did we not,
that you would not lie?
He has placed his new whore
in Orsini's palace, no?
I believe so, Your Eminence.
Question the staff, then,
in secret,
and in any way you see fit.
We need evidence of lechery,
fornication...
publico habet concubinem.
- Get these to the Deacon-
Cardinal for signatures.
Yes, Your Eminence.
He has met in secret
with those cardinals
that hate your father.
With Johannes Burchard,
he is making a case
for your father's deposition.
On what grounds?
Notorious and public lechery...
Lechery?
My father?
God forbid.
Has he evidence?
He means to find it.
Then perhaps
we should find it first,
and silence it before it speaks.
Your mother was somewhat
troubled yesterday.
She finds the change
in our life difficult.
So I noticed.
Do what you can
to keep her out of here.
It would help, maybe,
if you were more discreet
- in your affections.
- But I...
You are aware, Holy Father,
of the plots against you?
Oh, what would Rome be
without a good plot?
The College of Cardinals is
split down the middle.
What? Well, perhaps
we need some more cardinals.
Johannes Burchard has been
asked for an opinion...
Dear old Johannes.
- He does give excellent opinion.
- On your deposition, Father.
Indeed.
There are certain things
I could speak of...
...for a price.
Don't worry.
You'll get paid.
I would need to be.
I have seen things
within these walls
that would shock a brace
of courtesans.
Well, now, there's no need
to shock a courtesan, is there?
A brace of cardinals, perhaps.
You were asked
for a judgment, I believe,
- some nights ago?
- Your Holiness, as an expert
on canon law, when asked for
a judgment, I must provide it.
Please sit.
I would have your opinion, then,
dear Johannes, on the expansion
of the College of Cardinals.
It is the pope's prerogative
to appoint whom he wishes,
- Your Holiness.
- To whatever number he wishes?
Ah, well,
how many cardinals did
His Holiness have in mind?
How many would be needed
to make it safe for our papacy?
- Oh, dear.
- Come, come, Johannes.
You must be aware of the plots
against us?
You could even,
if viewed with an unkind eye,
be seen to be party to them.
When asked for an opinion,
Your Holiness, you know
that I must provide it.
Ah. So,
your opinion, then.
How many new cardinals
to preserve our papacy?
Umm...
- A baker's dozen, I would say.
- Mm!
Thirteen!
And we can appoint them
all at once?
Without the vote of conclave?
Such a great number would need
a precedent.
Oh.
Find one, then.
Your Holiness.
I have received advice
from our most supreme expert
in canon law,
that a pope's election may be
overturned
if we can provide evidence
of lechery,
both notorious and public.
That evidence
I present to you now.
Leave us, Micheletto.
And now, my dear,
tell us what you have witnessed.
There is a passage, connecting
the palace to the Vatican.
His Holiness makes use
of it... nightly.
And then?
He enters her bedroom
while she chastises herself.
And I blush to even describe
what happens next.
Spare us nothing.
I wanted seashells
and a sea horse.
But you have a sea horse,
my love.
No, I mean a real one.
Like your goat.
But real sea horses are tiny,
my love.
- Am I your love?
- I would dearly love you to be.
My mother hates you.
You will learn, my dear,
as women, we control
so little of our destiny.
- Men do.
- And?
The outcome is,
we hate each other.
- But we should not.
- Who should we hate, then?
- Men?
- No, my love.
It's in our nature to love them.
But we should protect ourselves
against them.
Against our feelings
towards them.
We will all of us,
one day, be replaced.
Are you giving me instruction?
- Would you like me to?
- I think I would.
- What weapons do I have with
which to protect myself? - Your beauty.
- Is that a weapon?
- It can be deadly,
when well used.
But beauty doesn't last forever.
Gone, like the snows
of last year.
- What else?
- When beauty fades?
Your wit.
Your intelligence.
- And I have those weapons?
- Oh, in abundance.
You should cultivate them.
You will be married some day.
You may need them...
sooner than you think.
Is she pretty,
this piece of evidence?
She has her charms, My Lord.
Perhaps you could see
that she takes a vow of silence.
Would God forgive us, Micheletto?
I know not the ways of God,
My Lord.
But you know the ways of silence.
: And we decree
bullfighting will be permitted
within the walls of Rome
on public festivals
and the last Thursday
of every month.
And, finally,
the main business to hand.
Cardinal Della Rovere needs
no staff today, understand?
For a day of meditation, he has
requested peace and silence.
You can tell the others.
Have you not heard?
His Eminence needs no staff
today.
It is a day of meditation. - He has much
on his mind. - Too much, some might say.
Such is the burden of great office.
Until tomorrow, my friend.
We wish to announce our decision
to expand the College
of Cardinals,
in view of the crippling
workload placed upon it
by our restructuring
of the affairs
of our Holy Mother Church.
Thirteen new servants of God...
...will receive
the cardinal's biretta.
Thirteen?!
We have judged it wise
to strengthen the College
of Cardinals, given the enemies
who have wormed their way
within the Church of Rome.
This is against all precedence.
His Holiness will fill
the College with his favourites.
- I accuse His Holiness...
- Ohhh! Of what are we now accused?
Of an offence against canon law.
Against the Law
of our Holy Mother Church.
Canon law?
But we have taken advice
from the most eminent
of all of our canon lawyers.
Apple...
...or peach?
Peach, I think.
I like peach.
Eat it all.
The Council of Constance is
most clear on this matter.
I refer you to Statute 42,
Paragraph 3...
In brief, I pray.
His Holiness, the pope, may
expand the College
to any number
he deems appropriate,
if the burden of work
necessitates...
I challenge him to name them now!
Your Holiness.
Oh...
Dottore, if you would be so kind.
: And His Holiness
comes behind the Lady Giulia
- thus!
- With the force of a stallion.
The Bishop of Lucca,
His Grace Fiorentini, will be
named Cardinal Fiorentini.
The Bishop of Naples, His Grace Giovanni
Mascoli, will be named Cardinal Mascoli.
The Bishop of Valencia, His Grace
Cesare Borgia, will be named Cardinal Borgia.
The pope would make his son
a cardinal?
I warn you, I have evidence
that will bring this house
- crashing down around your ears.
- Evidence?
Of lechery, transgressions,
both public and notorious!
Why, then, Cardinal,
you must present it.
I will!
The... Bishop of Lyon...
Though whether the Holy Father
is as virile as you...
Surely he is.
Only God can tell.
A candle, if you please!
Where is everyone?
Is there nobody about?
Dear Lord,
I pray for your strength
and guidance
in the trials to come.
Give us some sign
that Rome will be purified,
the Borgia stain will be
banished forever...
Guards! Guards!
Somebody!
Anybody!
Help!
Was the good cardinal known
for lechery?
He was discreet
in his affections, My Lord.
So discreet, indeed,
he asked me to clear the house
of servants yesterday.
He must have had
lecherous intentions, then.
But I'm... shocked
that they ended in murder.
And now he's fled, My Lord.
I would recommend discretion
in this matter.
The Church of Rome can
ill afford another scandal.
Perhaps he desired
her silence, My Lord.
He must have.
Poor girl...
Whom can one trust,
in this Rome of ours?
I believe trust needs
to be earned, My Lord.
Perhaps.
And perhaps it has been.
