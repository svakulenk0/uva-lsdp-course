Domino: Heads, you live.
Tails, you die.
Tails, you die.
My name is Domino Harvey.
My name is Domino Harvey.
I am a bounty hunter.
What I say
over the next several hours
will determine whether or not
I spend the rest of my life in prison.
Tails, you die.
Miss Harvey, my name is Taryn Mills.
I'm a criminal psychologist
working for the FBI.
I'm here to ask you
a few questions.
Domino: Here's the part
where I'm supposed
to get all defensive
and say, "Not until
I speak with my attorney."
I'll tell you everything I know.
$10 million was stolen
from an armoured car that
was subsequently found
abandoned at the Hoover Dam.
The driver's name was Locus Fender.
We know that he was in on the heist.
We know that
he was in on the heist.
Is it true that you were hired
to track down
and capture the thieves
and then deliver them to Drake Bishop,
owner of the Stratosphere
Hotel and Casino?
Yes.
You then learned
where the thieves
had hidden the money.
And at the instructions
of your employer,
went to retrieve the money yourself.
We were sent out
to the Fender Compound...
in the desert near the chicken ranch.
This way.
All right, on my go.
Watch your ass on this one.
Go.
Aaaah!
Sic 'em, boy! Sic 'em!
Fuck!
Chi Chi?
Domino: That's my best friend.
His name is Choco.
He's always fancied me,
but too shy to ever
do anything about it.
Chi Chi!
Edna, Chi Chi's in doggie hell.
All we want is the money.
Domino: That's Ed Moseby,
the most legendary bounty hunter
in all of Los Angeles.
He's my boss, my mentor,
the father I never had.
Chi Chi!
Oh, my poor Chi Chi!
The Manchurian Candidate,
eh, Edna?
Is that you, Domino?
Nice to see you, darling.
Your father must be so proud
of what's become of his little angel.
Listen, bitch, we've got your son!
If you don't give us the money,
we're gonna wax his fucking ass!
You don't have shit!
Hey, Choco.
Show her.
Aaaaah!
He's still alive, Edna!
Prove it!
Choco, go get him.
Anne Robinson: Last question for L20.
Start the clock. Zack, in anatomy,
a human being is usually
born with how many toes?
We got to show Edna her son.
Domino: That's our driver Alf.
He's from Afghanistan.
He once ate a cat.
We can't understand how to
pronounce his fucking name,
so we just call him
the cat eating alien.
What does that mean?
Shut the fuck up.
How did Locus Fender lose his arm?
He had the combination
to the safe tattooed on it.
Locus: Mama! Mama!
Locus!
Mama. Mama.
Baby, I'm here!
Please. Please.
You got to do as I say.
Now, the combination is on my arm.
Mama, you got to get the decoder.
Please, Mama.
Put your weapon down!
Put it down, Mama!
Put your fucking weapon down!
# Yeah, you know how is it,
you know how it go
# Hell, yeah, out there
tryin' just to eat
# Live, huh, survive
# What, yeah, bounce
# What, for the struggle
# Keep it movin', yeah
# Tryin' to make a living
Domino: Time to start at the beginning.
# Yeah
Time to start at the beginning.
Ed, echoing:
I'm the boss.
Choco: I'm already a cool
motherfucker, you know?
Man: I employ bounty hunters.
Woman: I'm here today to speak
for all the women of
mixed race in America.
Woman: I'm sorry?
# Yeah
Woman: I will knock
you out! Number one!
# Welcome
Woman: Brilliant.
# Yeah
Man: Where's my money?
# There's plenty of room
for everybody, man
Man: I fuckin' love that show.
# Yeah, bang
# Pimpin' ain't easy, y'all
# It's too sleazy, too greasy
# And I can't take it easy
# Tryin' to make a livin'
# 38 albums and still no dollars
# And you wanna know why
I hit the block for more
# These mad streets
# Tryin' to make a livin'
# 38 albums and still no dollars
# And you wanna know why
I hit the block for more
# These mad streets
# Got me puffin' on 'dro, I'm guilty
# For tryin' to make a livin'
Man: Maybe one of you will survive.
# Hell, yeah, out there tryin' just to eat
# Live, huh, survive
# What, yeah, bounce
# What?
# For the struggle
# Keep it movin'
# I'm gonna shoot straight
through the door
# If you're comin' with problems
# Expose my dominance
# Big dog, you're dead
Locus: Now, Mama!
Put your fucking weapon down!
# Yeah #
You got 10 minutes
to open that safe, Edna.
Fuck you!
Domino: I've never killed anyone.
I hope to never kill anyone,
even if they deserve it.
My agenda is to kick ass
and secure the bounty.
If I'm on this side of the law,
I can live the low life and avoid jail.
I can live the nasty
and not do time for it.
That's called
the best of both worlds.
As for that other world,
that 90210 world,
it's not for me.
Is that him?
Is that your dad?
Domino: My real father was an actor.
He died when I was a little girl.
Hi, Ben.
What the hell are you doing?
What's the matter with you?
Heh. I knew Frank.
Who didn't?
Hey, Edna...
You know what, sweetheart?
You got, like, 7 minutes
to open that goddamn freezer,
or I'm gonna flush that
fucking arm down the toilet.
Fucker!
Domino: You're probably
wondering how a girl like me
arrived here, at the arse end
of the Nevada Desert
with a blood-spattered Winnebago
and a one-armed man.
The Department of
Motor Vehicles in Los Angeles.
His name is Frances.
Mr 90210 college boy
had found himself
in the wrong place at the wrong time.
Hey, yeah, what's up?
OK.
Um, look, I said, um,
they're about to call
my number, like, any second.
Now, are you in, or are you out?
OK. Make up your fucking mind, 'cause
they're about to call my number.
Right now, 'cause they're about to call
my fucking number.
All right.
We're on.
PA: Now serving G086.
Hey. Um...
Kee Kee?
Um, Kee Kee said that
you could deliver the...
the IDs tonight.
Lateesha... I need that web link.
The J Lo concert is
probably sold out already.
Kee Kee don't make the rules.
Listen...
bitch...
I don't think you understand who
the fuck you're dealing with here.
OK? Because I could make
your job disappear like that.
Kee Kee said tonight.
Tonight, 8pm.
Anything else?
Nope.
Good-bye, Frances.
Good-bye, Lateesha.
Fuck 'em.
Fuck 'em all.
Domino: Lateesha, Frances,
and the 4 fake IDs
is where it all went wrong.
Where's the money?
I don't know.
I think that you're lying. I think you know
exactly where the money is.
I think you're trying to scare me
into falsely incriminating myself,
and it's not going to work.
This is your last chance. Once I walk
out that door, I can't help you.
Domino: When I was a little girl, my
father told me that if you weren't careful,
you could lose everything you've ever
earned in life in a split second.
You have to know when to cash out.
Thank you.
Man: He will wipe away
every tear from their eyes,
and death will be no more.
Neither will mourning nor outcry
nor pain be any more.
The former things have passed away.
And, look...
I am with you all the days
until the conclusion
of the system of things.
Domino: After Dad passed on, my
mum's agenda was to hit the town
and find another husband
with a boatload of cash.
Hello, Mr Stevens. How are you?
- Good holidays?
- Absolutely. Thank you.
Darling. Mwah. Mwah.
I love you, love you.
- Bye. Got to go, got to go.
- Bye.
Domino: She decided to sock me
and my goldfish Sammy away
in boarding school.
A week later, sammy died.
It was a pivotal moment in my life.
I decided to never invest too much
emotion in one thing.
It's always a set-up
to the pain of losing them.
# Another day, another dollar #
Domino: God created me
in His image.
# Blessed, and behold,
when daylight come
# To take control and cause
# Cause trouble
Domino: I guess
he had a thing for models.
I guess
he had a thing for models.
Like most models,
I was bored with life.
I hated everything and everyone.
Domino: If you think America
is dirtbag central,
clearly you've never been to the sleaze
nation of our Queen Mother.
Wogan: I hope all this
is not gonna change you.
One thing we'd like to change, though...
You said lan's name wrong.
- Right, it's "eye-an".
- Lan Ziering, not "ee-an" Ziering.
It's "eye-an", since birth.
Brilliant... Absolutely brilliant.
Domino: Mum was determined
to move us to Beverly Hills.
That damn show started it all.
That damn show
started it all.
She remarried to a man
named Mark Waldman.
He invested in a restaurant
called the Hard Rock Cafe.
# You thought the party
was a big surprise...
Domino, Domino, give the goddamn
numchucks a rest already.
It's time for supper. Come on, baby.
Domino: I tried
Beverly Hills High for a spell,
but it didn't work out.
I hated them. I hated them all.
All: 5, 6, 7, 8!
We are Alpha Omega
we are the AOPs, uh-huh...
Domino: College was even worse.
Mum convinced me to join a sorority.
It was all fun and games at first.
Then the hazing started.
This is fucking disgusting!
Disgusting!
Llook at these mosquito bites.
What's it like to have the body
of a 10-year-old boy?
Crowd: Ohh...
- Have you had a nose job?
- No.
Domino: A week later, I was expelled.
In the end,
it all came down to fate...
An LA Weekly advert
strewn across the ground.
Claremont Williams III...
- Yeah!
- The legendary bail bondsman.
I'm here for
the bounty hunter seminar.
Cash?
Keep the change.
Claremont: See, as a bail bondsman,
I'm the go-between for
the court and the accused.
For a 10% fee,
I will guarantee the amount
set by the court.
Now...
if the defendant should fail to appear
at his or her court date,
I will bring in a bounty hunter
to recapture the defendant,
or I will face having to repay
the court costs myself,
which... we can't do.
Now, this occurs most...
frequently when the collateral
or the guarantee
given to the bondsman
turns out to be worthless
or difficult to liquidate.
So... in layman's terms,
we get 10% of the bail.
Now, in the next few moments,
Ed Moseby will take the podium,
and he will begin the seminar
on how to become a bounty hunter.
In the meantime, feel free to take
a coffee break, pee break, whatever.
We'll be starting
in the next few minutes.
Hey, how about it? Want to ride
some bounty hunter cock?
- Fuck you, dickhead.
- Ooh. Bitch!
Excuse the fuck out of us!
We got to ditch this thing.
Gentlemen...
it has been a pleasure.
All right, bathroom window, 5 minutes.
I'll keep the engine running.
Domino: Nobody really knows
where Ed came from.
This much is clear...
the man's been places,
seen things, lived life.
He did a term in Soledad
and a term in Angola,
where he lost a toe during a prison riot.
The man's a warrior.
Domino: To say that Choco is
the product of a broken home
is to presume a home existed
in the first place.
No. Choco never had a home.
Well, not unless you count
correction facilities,
where he spent his childhood.
Mierda! Damn!
Goddamn!
Puta...
- What the fuck is this?
- Where the fuck are you going?
Those people paid for a seminar!
Where do you get off
fucking up my windshield?
I want a job!
Jesus fuckin' Christ, lady.
Everybody wants a goddamn job.
What makes you think you
can do this one, huh?
I've been training since I was 12.
Knives, guns, throwing stars.
You name it, I can fight with it.
I'm a hard worker. I'm a hard worker.
I'm fast to learn, and nothing scares me.
I'm not afraid to die.
Why would a...
delicate little thing like you
want to be a goddamn bounty hunter?
I want to have a little fun.
You want to have a little fun?
Well, little girl, you want a job?
Yeah.
It's gonna cost you a new windshield.
You know what? Enough of that
"little girl" shit. The name is Domino.
Domino.
- Domino what?
- No, just Domino.
Let's take a ride.
Qué?
The kid's name is Hector Maldonado,
His mother posted bail for him,
after he was arrested for a drive-by.
He speaks perfect fuckin' English.
He just thinks it's cute
when he's around
a good-looking woman.
Hey. Yeah, listen.
Louise, listen,
you can make this easy,
or you can make it real complicated.
Domino: For $200, Louise gave us
her boyfriend's whereabouts
at the local gangbanger hangout
across the street.
What's his problem?
Latin petulance. Hold on.
Give me a minute with him.
All right, come on,
princess, spit it out.
Why do we need that bitch on the
team? You don't like what I'm doing?
- I can hear you.
-
Hey, baby, why don't you take a walk
and let me handle this?
First, she ain't on the team yet.
OK?
Second of all,
take a look at her.
I mean, come on, man, she ain't ugly.
You and I walk down the street,
what do people see?
A couple of losers, right?
We add her to the equation, you know
what people are gonna think?
What?
There goes two of the coolest
motherfuckers who ever lived. Hmm?
You know what?
I don't know about you, man, but...
I'm already
a cool motherfucker, you know?
Sometimes you got
your own tongue up your ass.
Little fuckin' pendejo.
Domino: I could feel the blood
coursing through my veins.
Merry Christmas.
Did you ever use one of these?
Ever heard of the
Beverly Hills Gun Club?
Domino: Shotgun in hand,
kicking down a door and wondering
if there was heavy firepower
on the other side.
Domino, you cover the side.
Choco, you cover the rear.
On my word.
Domino: Turns out...
my first raid was to be
a near-disaster.
That bitch Louise set us up.
Hector was hiding underneath
her bed all along.
- Hey, what's up, fool?
- Hurry! There's 3 po-pos out front!
Fuck. You serious?
Ed : On my go.
Go.
Domino:
That night, my coin was tossed.
Heads, you live. Tails, you die.
Life or death.
This ain't Sunset Boulevard.
My destiny was life.
Life as a bounty hunter.
Put that shit down, homey!
What the fuck you doin', bitch?!
Step back, motherfucker!
What the fuck you want?
We're not cops. We're bounty hunters.
All we want is Hector.
Fuck you and the fuckin' po-pos, bitch!
You tell me where he is,
and I'll give you...
You'll what?
Domino: Sometimes a girl has to be
naughty to get herself out of a jam.
I'll give you a lap dance.
Man, fuck you, bitch!
I'll give you a lap dance,
bra and panties on.
Man, if I wanted all that,
I'd go to a strip joint, motherfucker.
Come on, you and me.
You know you want it.
Hey, what do you think, dawg?
I want to see what the fuck
this bitch is workin' with.
- I'm offering it to you, baby. Come on.
- Is that right?
Well, take off your clothes, bitch.
Sit down.
That's right, girl.
That's right, girl.
Domino: It worked.
We got the scoop
on how to find Hector.
Domino: Claremont was Charlie
to our three Angels.
It's very simple. The, um...
DMV is the de facto conduit
for all humanity,
and every human being
that we track down
has a record in the DMV database.
Uh, whether it be LAPD,
Social Services,
the Credit Bureau, or the FBI,
they all use the DMV's database
as their hub.
So, we have people on the inside
who feed us the information.
This one right there.
Ohh, shit. And who would know it?
The gatekeepers of humanity turn out
to be a bunch of sassy black women.
Excuse me?
He said he liked your suit.
- Tell him what you said.
- I like your suit.
Domino: After 6 months,
Claremont hired Alf to drive us around.
We were so busy.
Little did I know that the FBI liked
to keep tabs on us bounty hunters.
Ed, what did you do
before you were a bounty hunter?
I played music. I was a musician.
Really?
What, in a band?
Did you ever hear
of Stevie Ray Vaughan?
Wait, you're shitting me.
Stevie and I hlooked up in Austin.
Back in the day,
we did the bus tour thing together.
Played every goddamn
small club that would have us.
Yep. Me and that boy, we tore it up.
Holy shit.
Played with Pat Benatar,
but that was only when I needed cash.
Oh, fuck off. I love Pat Benatar.
Hey... So did I.
But that's another story.
Love is a battlefield, baby.
What about Choco?
How did you meet him?
I met Choco on the street...
a few hours after he got out of lockup.
He was standing there
in a pair of those jailhouse slippers.
He didn't have a nickel in his pocket
or a place to sleep.
We started talking, and I liked the kid.
Like a little brother.
You know?
Worst thing in the world
is to be caged up.
That boy has been there,
and he ain't never goin' back.
Even if it costs him his life.
- What you lookin' at, darlin'?
- Nothing!
Domino: Put that fucking gun down!
Put the fucking gun down!
Domino: Choco grew up
on the streets of Venezuela.
When he was four years old,
he stabbed another kid in the eyeball
with a pencil.
There were wires crossed
somewhere in his soul.
Domino: In 2003,
I was named Bounty Hunter of the Year.
To the woman who has brought
beauty and grace
to this profession...
Domino Harve-e-e-ey!
Domino: From that day on, Eddie,
Choco, and I were inseparable.
It turned out
the three sassy black women and Raul
were the gatekeepers of humanity...
the DMV.
Lateesha was one of
Claremont's many mistresses.
Claremont was godfather to us all.
Just look at that luscious action
right there. Look at that.
Oh, man, I'm gonna get you
a pair of glasses.
Hey.
That's an ass.
# My soldiers come with missiles,
gauges, grenades, and pistols
# Picture on the front of the paper
dyin' to press the issue
# My soldiers' gettin' at you
# Full clip is spittin' at you
# You duck, you're stuck in position
# Just like a fuckin' statue
# Nigga, I'm quarterbackin'
# We got it fully...
# Keep on actin' like
it ain't gonna happen
# Till it happen, when it happen
# You gonna wish it never did
# Motherfucker...
# Till it happen, when it happen
# You gonna wish it never did
# Motherfucker
: Weather's gonna be
a great day today. Lots of sunshine.
Cool temperatures, though.
We should be at 76 degrees.
You know, a guy could get used
to a life this ordinary.
Maybe you should...
Maybe you should fuck her mom, too.
What the fuck is your problem, bitch?
Mother: So, who is this Choico?
Domino: Mum was terrified for me.
She didn't approve
of my lifestyle one bit.
Is he your new boyfriend?
His name is Choco, and he's not
my boyfriend. He's a bounty hunter.
Whatever. He's a criminal.
And that Ed Moseby character...
I mean, he's a complete loser.
He knew Frank Sinatra.
Who didn't?
Domino: We may have been
dysfunctional, but we worked.
We were family.
Do you know this man?
Yeah, he's a reality television producer.
His name's Mark Heiss.
Mr Heiss was very generous in turning
over some videotapes to the FBI.
There's lots of footage of you.
We know everything.
Domino: Mark Heiss
was friends with Mum.
I hate this!
They changed the fucking font!
Domino: He heard my story
at some cocktail party.
She's stupid! You're not stupid.
- All right.
- Get Cynthia on the line!
- Well, Domino's in the lobby.
- They changed the fucking font!
Well, Domino's been waiting.
Put her in the conference room.
Turns out, he wanted
to put us on television.
I should let you know that
Mr Heiss will only be available to meet
for about five minutes, so we should
hurry up and cut to the point.
Um, and speak in short sentences
because he has the attention span
of a ferret on crystal meth.
Domino: Mum was horrified
and demanded to tag along
just to keep me from signing anything.
- I've seen that.
- Um... Excuse me?
A ferret on crystal meth.
You don't speak...
you don't speak Spanish?
- No.
- No?
This is LA, man.
You should speak Spanish, you know?
OK, everybody has water. Um...
Um... God, he should be here
any second. Oh, here he is.
- Sophie.
- Hello.
Sorry, guys, about the wait.
I'm having font issues.
Let me cut to the chase
'cause I have to take this call.
We want to follow you around
with a camera crew for a week.
The last thing we did...
the pilot episode... is not testing well.
We got too many rednecks.
It's too much like Cops.
We need... Go ahead.
We need...
something sexy!
Something different.
We need Domino.
We need Domino.
Listen, uh, friend...
we ain't gonna do this thing
unless the whole team
gets equal coverage.
You're not her father, Ed.
No one cares what you think.
Well, with all due respect, Mom,
I'm her boss,
and she's on my team. OK?
And unless we all get equal coverage,
we're all gonna walk the fuck
out of here together, huh?
Hmm? Equal coverage, or we all walk.
Done! OK.
The whole team... We follow it.
What guarantee can you give us that
Domino's name won't be tarnished?
Sophie, this is reality television.
What you see is what you get.
Oh. You will be exploited,
your story won't be told truthfully,
and your life will never be the same.
I beg you.
I beg you not to get involved with this...
this drivel!
No offence, Mark,
but we both know that this is drivel.
No offence taken.
Anyway, if she's gonna be in anything,
she should be in the centre.
Sure, OK.
But...
Done!
Talk it over. I have to take this call.
Cynthia, you changed the fucking font
on the promo! Why?
Domino: I felt like a hypocrite,
given my hatred of all things Hollywood,
but I'll admit...
I wanted my story told.
I wanted everyone to know
the things I'd done.
I wanted some recognition
in the world.
We'll do it.
We'll do it.
God help us. God help us all.
Domino:
It was the beginning of the end.
Crowd: Jerry! Jerry!
Welcome back. We're here in LA
with mixed race single mothers.
Our next guest
takes pride in the fact
that she's in the Guinness
Book of World Records
for being America's
youngest grandmother.
And... she's only 28.
Please welcome Lateesha Rodriguez!
Domino: Lateesha was
our prime contact at the DMV.
Most of our bond certificates
came from Claremont through her.
- Hey, Jerry!
- Hey, Lateesha. How are you?
- I'm fine.
- What's going on?
I'm here today to speak
for all people of mixed race in America.
Now, as a blactino woman, I believe
we deserve our own race category
to forge an identity, Jerry.
That's how I feel.
Did you just say "blactino"?
Yes, I did. I'm a blactino-American.
Wow. Uh, first of all...
first of all, you don't even look latino.
You look black.
You're... You're black.
Second of all, I'm of mixed race,
and I've struggled my whole life
as to whether I'm Chinese
or whether I'm black.
Chinegro! What you are is chinegro!
- Chinegro?
- Chinegro! There you go!
- Chinegro?
- You are a chinegro!
- What the  is chinegro?
- That's what you are! Chinegro is you!
That's some bulls... .
OK, as I understand it, you brought
a mixed-race flow chart with you.
Why don't we bring that out?
How you doin', sugar? All right.
I'm gonna call you later.
Mwah. All right.
Take a look at this...
Blactino, blackasian, hispasian, OK?
Now, for the Asian subcategories,
I got you, sister.
We have chinegro right here.
That's you. Chinegro.
That's not a word! That's not a word!
Yes, it is, sister.
We have koreagro. Japegro, OK?
Chispanic, koreaspanic,
and last but not least,
check this out, y'all... japanic.
That's how I flow with it!
Do you believe the government should
recognise these racial subgroups?
Yes, Jerry, I do.
Hey, wait!
First of all, first of all,
uh-uh, honey, let me tell you,
from one, uh, blactino woman
to another...
- Right on.
- Our concern is education!
You ever hear of that?! Here you are,
a 28-year-old grandmother!
Yes, I am.
You need to add another category
to your flow chart.
It's called birth control, bitch!
OK, yeah. Check this out.
I am educated, you blactino bitch!
What?!
I'm a Devry graduate! And, yes,
my daughter might be a single mother...
- I'll kick your ass! I'll kick your ass!
- Bring it, bitch!
Crowd: Jerry! Jerry!
Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!
- Come on, Bri. We're late, we're late.
- Dude, it's fucking Mapquest.
I told you, never again
with that piece of shit.
Guys.
Come meet Domino.
Domino, I want you to meet
the co-hosts of Bounty Squad.
Domino: Fucking... fucking... fucking...
fucking 90210.
I couldn't get away from it.
It wasn't until later on that I realised
Mum had gotten to Heiss
and pulled some strings.
Lan Ziering.
Brian Austin Green. Domino.
Cocoa... Choco.
- Cocoa?
- Choco.
Choco. Sorry.
The man from Afghanistan
has made some significant
changes to the RV.
Oh, my God.
Are those real bones?
Monkey... monkey bones?
Shrunken heads?
From my family.
I drive these bounty hunters
for a free Afghanistan.
Wow. I didn't know
this was gonna be a political show.
Domino: Alf grew up during the Russian
invasion of Afghanistan.
He had always wanted to be
part of the revolution
but it seemed to pass him by.
At the tender age of 14,
he decided that explosives
would be his speciality.
Domino: His eyebrows
never grew back.
OK, Ed, uh...
What background should someone have
if they want to go into bounty hunting?
How does jail sound?
So, tell me, do you boys hunt?
I killed a... I killed a squirrel...
once.
Well, let me tell you something.
Once you hunt a human being,
you'll never hunt an animal again.
You know, it's a different kind of rush.
The problem is, is that when
you've done it for as long as I have,
all you got to show for it is
an empty bank account and, uh, IBS.
- IBS?
- Yeah, that's irritable bowel syndrome.
You got a spastic colon?
That's hysterical.
You know, my grandmother
has one of those.
Does your grandmother hunt?
Uh, well, I don't know. Maybe.
Why don't you just
shut the fuck up, huh?
You were supposed to talk about
the healthcare crisis!
Exactly. Why would you use
Jerry Springer
as a platform for some kind of
progressive race modification proposal?
Well, I don't think Ted Koppel
would blook Lateesha Rodriguez!
- Not a chance.
- Not a chance in hell. Hmm.
OK, Jerry is one of the only forums
our people have, baby.
I thought having time on Springer
would give me a chance
of gettin' a blook deal
or a correspondence gig on BET.
Jenny Jones bitch got cancelled.
Yeah, Montel would've been better.
Domino: Lateesha's granddaughter
Mika had a rare blood disease.
Her white cell count was dropping fast.
Dad?
We need money.
I got an idea.
What?
Armoured car business.
We just signed a new
insurance policy in Nevada.
There's a loophole.
Domino: Claremont Williams,
bail bondsman,
armoured car service,
bounty hunter service.
An unusual combination.
Kee Kee, me and Claremont
are working on a plan
to get money for Mika.
A real good plan, baby... a good plan.
Are you aware that Lateesha Rodriguez
has been running
a counterfeit driver's licence racket?
Well, that's the word on the street.
You drove Lateesha's daughter
to school,
then dropped her off
at the DMV. Why?
Her car was in the shop.
How convenient. The morning
you call in sick, I turn on the TV
and see you all over Jerry Springer.
- Never heard of TiVo?
- Think I can afford it?
Give me a break, Pat.
What do you want?
I got a call yesterday from
our health care provider.
They said you tried to pass your
granddaughter off as Kee Kee
down at City Terrace
Community Hospital.
They said you forged the age on the
application for some sort of operation.
Motherfuckin' HMOs
don't cover grandchildren.
That fuckin' operation is $300,000.
Where am I gonna get the money, Pat?
You should've thought about that
before you became a grandmother.
Fuck you.
You got 2 weeks to clear out your desk.
Domino: It just kept
getting worse for Lateesha.
- What?
- Did I stutter? 2 weeks.
Domino: No one could've
expected what happened next.
Oh, by the way, there are a couple of
FBI agents here that want to talk to you.
Woman: You're gonna go to jail
for a long, long time, Lateesha.
Man:
Unless you cooperate with us.
Domino: Their names
were Cosgrove and Wilson.
Someone had tipped them off
to Lateesha's counterfeit scam,
but that's not what
they were really after.
I'm listening.
In about 10 minutes,
a college kid named Frances
is gonna walk up to your window
and ask for 4 counterfeit IDs.
You could help us out here.
Lateesha, we want
to know what he's up to.
I mean, look at you. You got your hair
did, your nails lookin' all good.
You go to jail, that's all gonna go away.
- Won't see your kids for a long time.
- Think about it.
It's gonna be long as hell.
Domino: This was when Lateesha
decided to do something foolish,
and Frances was
in the wrong place at the wrong time.
OK.
OK. He and three of his friends
are gonna hijack an armoured truck.
They're gonna walk away
with 10 million in cash.
PA: Now serving G086.
Hey.
Weatherman: Sunshine, that's for sure.
We should be at 76 degrees,
the downtown area barely breaking
that 70-degree mark.
lows dropping down to 48 degrees.
All right, y'all, Lateesha done...
Lateesha done dug herself a deep hole,
and, uh, she can't get out by herself.
Can y'all dig what I'm saying?
Mija, we're in a hole together.
We dig together. We're a team.
Just like Billy Ocean says:
"When the going gets tough..."
"the tough get going."
Domino: There are 3 kinds
of people in this world...
the rich,
the poor, and everyone in between.
Think you're having a tough day?
You should see this.
I got an armoured truck that's empty.
Yeah.
I think Mr Wonderful is pulling up now.
Domino: That's Drake Bishop, owner
of the Stratosphere Hotel and Casino.
He's worth a billion dollars,
His attorney, Burke Beckett.
- I'm Detective Chris Cudlitz.
- We know who you are.
Where's my money?
I think it's probably best
if we take a look at the tapes.
Cudlitz: Our tapes show
that at 6:23am,
your truck pulls into the parking lot
and turns the engine off.
- Rewind, please.
- Rewind the tape.
- Freeze the tape.
- Freeze the tape.
- Now, can you zoom in?
- Zoom in, please.
You a fucking mockingbird?
Shut the fuck up!
I just...
- Nancy Reagan.
- I think that's Hillary Clinton.
- Fat ankles.
- It's Barbara fucking Bush.
And Jacqueline Onassis
just to her left.
Christ almighty, it's the goddamned
First Ladies.
If you don't mind me
asking you, Mr Bishop,
what exactly is in those tan duffel bags?
- You don't have to answer that.
- Shut up, Burke. $10 million, cash.
Don't tell me it was a fucking hijacking.
How'd you get me
in this position, Burke?
Mr. Bishop?
You have an urgent telephone call, sir.
Yeah. Bishop.
Bishop, this is Claremont Williams.
I own the Williams Brothers
Armoured Car Service.
Yeah.
Um, hold on a minute, please.
Let me isolate it.
Yesterday I received
an e-mail from a source.
In this e-mail were
four social security numbers
made to counterfeit
California driver's licences.
And?
I believe these are the gentlemen
who robbed us, sir.
I'm also a bail bondsman
out of Los Angeles,
and I can track down and deliver these
thieves to you for a small finder's fee.
- How much?
- Just $300,000.
And what happens
if you don't deliver?
My theft insurance policy
will have to fork over that $10 million.
That will take 6-8 months.
But you should know, sir,
that I employ bounty hunters,
and my bounty hunters can and will
track down these thieves.
Well, you deliver these crooks to me
and you've got yourself a deal...
Thank you, sir. That's a deal.
Domino: Crime boss Anthony Cigliutti.
Bishop's attorney had put his boss
in business with the mob.
They're asking for a finder's fee.
Finder's fee? That's bullshit.
Sounds like an inside job to me.
Could be. Who knows
if this Claremont Williams
is in on the heist or not.
All I know, if this joker
delivers the First Ladies,
we'll split the 300,000 fee with you.
All right, gentlemen.
Sounds like we got a little situation here.
Domino: Quite a mess indeed.
Beckett had just brokered
an underhanded deal with Cigliutti.
The 10 million,
en route from LA to Vegas,
belonged to the mob.
Bishop's clean reputation was a great
cover for laundered cash.
If the FBI could link
the two men together,
it would be the takedown of the century.
The FBI was always listening,
hence the underwater cordless.
Kinison: Oh! Ohh!
In Needles.
Domino: Locus Fender was brought in
to drive the armoured car,
another one of Claremont's
network of stooges.
His mother Edna
worked at the Nedles DMV.
Mama! You're not gonna believe this.
Mama, come quick!
- Where are the First Ladies?
- They disappeared.
What do you mean, they disappeared?
Domino: According to Locus,
they stopped for gas.
I'm gonna fill up the tank and grab
a Mountain Dew. Don't make a peep.
Especially you, Barbara.
- Hey, man.
- Hey, how's it going?
I need to get, uh...
$8 of gas and, um...
A Mountain Dew.
Do you have Moonpie?
Yeah, I got a couple of them over there.
And a slim...
Shit! No, no, no!
Domino: He was sure they'd nabbed
the cash. Straight-up double-cross.
But they'd left without it.
That doesn't make any sense.
Well, they left all the money.
It doesn't make sense...
Locus! Fuck 'em. Their loss is our gain.
Put the money in the freezer.
- Mama?
- Locus... Fuck 'em.
OK, Mama.
Domino: Either this was some kind of
setup, or the First Ladies got scared,
decided to pull out and cut their losses.
Are you wearing makeup?
What, can you tell? Huh?
You're wearing eyeliner, man.
You look like a drag queen.
Who the hell is that?
Guys, it's time.
We need the bounty hunters.
Come on! 110%.
Llooks like Night of the Living Dead.
Are we on? Now?
Yeah, now.
- Is that a joint?
- No. He's not smoking.
Put that down. You know, television...
the people watching, those kids...
Yeah, yeah...
Domino: Claremont fed us a fake story
about the First Ladies.
Are we rolling?
So, today, Domino and her team are out
to nab four criminals for forging checks
with counterfeit driver's licences.
What can you tell us about
these 4 creeps, Domino?
Apparently, they call
themselves the First Ladies.
