Well, this was supposed
to be a surprise.
It is.
Yeah. For me.
I thought you were
sound asleep.
You must be
feeling guilty.
Thank you so much.
Happy birthday, Abby.
Mmm.
Mmm. We are
being watched.
Aww, sweetheart.
Did we wake you up?
Mm-hmm.
We did? I'm sorry.
Red bunny.
I'm sorry, baby.
Sorry, girls.
What can I say?
Come here, little girl.
Ah.
Ok. Group hug.
Mmm. Group hug.
Mmm.
Back to bed.
Aw, baby.
Did I wake you?
Come on,
you guys, to bed.
Ahh!
Somebody.
Hi.
Hello, birthday girl.
How are you?
I'm well.
Are we still 29?
And a half.
Ooh, let me see.
Let me see.
Look what he got me.
Can you stand it?
Oh, my god.
You make me sick.
Ooh, you know what?
I brought something, too.
Thank you.
Yes, indeed.
It's your birthday.
Yeah. It could be
with that bracelet.
Bye, Sophie.
Just kidding.
Ahh!
Patriotic man.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
That's a little pregnant.
Looks like
your ex-boyfriend.
Yeah, it does.
Oh, look at this,
babe.
Look what she got
for me.
Mmm. Nice touch.
Now...Ladies,
Make sure you have that
girls day out tomorrow, ok?
Just leave
the platinum card, Neil.
I will.
You know, I think
your sitter
Is gonna have a hell
of a long day.
Yeah, we're gonna
go wild.
Yeah!
Well, then.
Gotta go.
Bye.
See you tonight.
Ok.
Diane, I will
see you later.
See you, Neil.
You know, you have
the greatest husband ever.
I think you
might be right.
Aw, you're beautiful.
You really, you really
really are.
Big launch
on Monday, huh?
Yeah. Big launch.
trying to get that--
account.
I just about
bust my jaw
Smiling at
those shitheads.
Then, the old man
gives it to you
And it gets done
overnight.
What is your secret,
Neil? Tell me.
Ok. Tell you
what I'm gonna do.
Today, 4 p.M., we got
the Ronsin pitch.
I will hang back...
And leave it all
to you.
How's that sound?
I'm not so hot
on electrical appliances.
So what do you say?
Does Abby know that
you're not perfect?
I won't go that far.
You're gonna go far
all right.
I think you'd derail
this account.
The TV spots--
it's nationwide.
The awareness
on this thing--
People are going crazy
for it. I'm telling you.
It's gonna destroy
our competition.
Sad bastards.
Anyway, Neil,
it's outstanding work.
It's really terrific.
These--
trails are genius.
Thanks.
Those boys in the white room
at Magris
Are gonna piss themselves
they never got it.
No chance of
a spoiler, right?
No. Not at all.
Good. Ok.
You're not gonna need me
this afternoon,
So I'll see you all
at 5.
That's nice.
Oh, uh, Karl.
About that Ronsin pitch.
Yeah? What about it?
Well, I was
just thinking
It might be better
if, uh,
maybe just one of us
dealt with it.
You know, they're not
really the kind
To go for
that hard sell.
Ok. Well, which one of you
wants to do it?
You know. I'm easy.
I don't know.
Jerry, what do you say?
You wanna do it?
Yeah. I do. Absolutely.
No.
You do it, Neil.
You don't sit
on the bench
When you're batting
a thousand.
Wow. Well...
If you're sure.
I don't know. Is that
ok with you, Jerry?
But we did the heavy
lifting on that.
No. It's fine.
Good. Ah.
Just keep passing
every test.
Big plans for you, Neil.
Big plans.
You have a second?
Woman:
Neil Randall's office.
Hey, Judy. It's Abby.
Hi, Mrs. Randall.
Happy birthday.
Thank you so much.
Is Neil around?
Uh, he's just
finishing up with Karl.
Do you want to hold?
Ah-ha! They're planning
Their little weekend
adventure, are they?
Something like that.
Listen, do you think
he'll want to keep him
Late again tonight
or what?
Uh, no.
I don't think so.
Good. 'cause I got
something special planned.
Listen, Judy.
Can I ask you something?
Mm-hmm.
Between you and me,
Do you think this
means a promotion?
Well, let's just say
it's looking good.
Oh!
You did it again, Neil.
Hey, what can I say?
You just gotta raise
your game. That's all.
Be on him more.
Come on. It's nothing
personal. You know that.
But that's what
it takes, right?
I don't know. Does it?
I feel bad for him,
But what am I
supposed to do?
All right, all right.
So how was your day?
Eh.
Yeah?
Hmm.
Well,
that was fantastic.
Tastes even better
since I quit the smokes.
Mmm.
Our song.
# here's what I'll do #
# I'll take care of you #
What are you thinking?
# I love and lost #
# the same as you #
Oh, you devil.
# so you see, I know #
# just what
you've been through #
# so if you let me #
# here's what I'll do #
# oh, I'll take
care of you #
What if I asked you
to stay this weekend?
Abby, you know
I want to.
Stop.
I was just kidding.
Just kidding.
I know how much
this means to you.
I mean, how often does
he invite an executive
To his country estate?
No. Important for
both of us, honey.
For both of us.
# dry your weeping eyes #
# oh, darling, tell me #
Sophie. Sophie.
Give me.
Sophie. Sophie!
Abby: You ready?
I'm packed.
I love that one, honey.
I'm not trying
to seduce him, babe.
Well, it will remind
you of me.
It might bring you luck.
I got it.
That's almost sweet.
We'd better get going
If you want to get
to Diane's in time.
Hello.
Hello.
I'm Helen Schriver.
The agency sent me.
Come in.
I'm a little early.
It's ok. This is
my husband Neil.
Hey, Helen.
Hello.
Oh, look at you.
You must be Sophie.
This is Helen, the lady
that I told you about
That's gonna sit
for you tonight.
Hey.
Who's that?
Her name's Sherry.
We're playing a game.
Could I play, too?
Ok.
Why don't you
go show Helen
The swimming pool
you built for Sherry.
Thanks.
Oh, that's a really cool
swimming pool.
Do you want to put
a diving board
On the end of it?
What? What's wrong?
She seems a bit old,
don't you think?
I thought the agency
would send someone younger.
Oh, yeah. That's right.
Someone who could
spend all night
On the phone
with her boyfriend
While the house
burns down.
Fine.
Ouch.
Oh, babe.
Could you get
my black Prada pressed
While I'm gone?
It'll make
my whole weekend, honey.
Sophie: This is rabbit.
We watch TV together.
I love you, sweetie.
I'll see you tonight, ok?
Bye, mommy.
Bye, honey.
here you go, baby.
Daddy's gonna miss you.
Bye-bye.
Don't tell mom.
Ok.
Shh.
Mwah!
Bye, daddy.
Bye. Oh, Helen...
If my wife gets back
before midnight,
Do not let her in.
She's under
strict instructions
To have a good time.
Helen: Ok.
Baby, did I pack
my razors?
No, you didn't.
I did.
What would I do
without you, huh?
Bye, baby.
Sophie:
miss you.
I love you.
Abby: I'll be there
in 20, Diane. Ok?
Neil's got a promotion
to get, remember?
Ok. Bye.
Neil: Baby, let's not get
carried away with this, ok?
I mean, we don't know
if he's gonna offer me
A partnership.
We just don't.
I mean, he may just want
to bond, talk business.
That's if I can even
find this place.
It's in the middle
of nowhere.
Ok. What's on your mind?
Just thinking about
how far we've come.
Yeah, we have.
Didn't I promise you
it'd be worth it?
Come on.
We were leading
Separate lives
in Denver.
Now, look at us.
You know what
I'm also thinking?
I'm gonna start calling around
to some of the agencies.
No. What, get back
into photography?
Yes. Just locally.
I mean, I think my days
of cruising the freeways
Are long gone.
Yeah. Why don't you
go for it?
Abby:
you don't mind?
Mind? I think
it's a great idea.
Man: Me, too.
oh, my god!
Neil: What the hell
are you doing?
Get your hands
on the wheel!
Keep your hands
on the goddamn wheel!
What do you want?
Huh?
What do you want?
I've got
what I want.
Right here.
What do you mean?
Nice and easy.
Please, don't do
anything stupid, ok?
Nice and easy.
Nice and steady.
Ok, I'm steady.
I'm steady.
Here you go.
It's for you.
Take it.
Take it.
It's Sophie.
Oh, Christ, no!
Don't you--
Don't you want
to talk?
What are you--
shut up!
You shut up.
Please, don't!
Talk. Talk!
Ok!
Talk.
Sophie--hi, sweetheart.
It's mommy.
Listen to me.
It's just a game.
It's just a game,
baby, ok?
Listen, do whatever
the lady says. All right?
That's a good--yeah.
Daddy's right here.
That's enough.
That's enough.
That's enough.
That's enough.
Give it to me.
No! Let me speak
to my daughter!
That's enough!
That's enough!
god.
I swear to god,
if you hurt our daughter--
I don't give a shit
about your daughter.
How much do you want?
How much you got?
I don't know exactly.
$142,367.
Exactly.
Just you.
Wait. Any withdrawal
over 20 grand needs
My signature, too.
fine.
Fine.
Just remember
why we're here.
I make one phone call
to my lady friend,
And you'll never see
your daughter again.
Keep an eye on him, Abby.
Run along now.
You ok?
No, I'm good.
Who is this guy?
I don't know.
You were right
about that woman!
Don't--don't stop.
She's going to be fine.
But what if they've
done something to her?
She's going
to be all right!
Made a call already.
Hi, Abby.
How've you been?
Suzanne.
I'm good.
How are you?
Good, good.
And your daughter--
She must be
starting school--
She's good.
I'm so sorry.
I'm in such a rush.
I'll see you later, ok?
Sure, sure.
Have a good day now.
What are you doing?
Huh?
I'm calling the cops.
No!
You cannot
call the cops.
Babe, babe,
he's right there. He's--
We have to do
exactly what he says.
But I just thought--
No, listen to me.
Just calm down.
Let's go.
Is that everything?
Yes, of course
it's everything.
What, you think
I'm going
To risk Sophie's life
For the sake
of a few bucks?
You just did.
Oh, Jesus Christ.
Abby.
I'm sorry.
Let's just get it
over with.
Hi, how are you?
Hi.
I'd like to make
a withdrawal.
Um...
I'm going to need some I.D.
Sure.
What do you need
him for?
Well, it's just that
it's a very large amount--
Yeah,
it's a large amount,
But it's our money,
isn't it?
Of course, sir.
Then just do it!
Stop it.
Listen to me.
You're going to blow
this whole thing,
All right?
Just for Sophie.
Just go back
to the car.
Ok?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
My husband's
Under a lot of pressure
right now, so...
You're not too good
in a crisis, are you, Neil?
Shit!
Is there a problem here?
Uh...
No, officer....
Ok, then move it.
Yeah, I'm just waiting--
Move it now.
Excuse me.
Sorry.
Cash and cards now.
Chop, chop.
Give us your purse.
Wallet.
Straight across here.
Straight across
right here.
It's over now, ok?
You've got what you want.
Now give us back
our daughter.
That's every cent
we have.
Well, let's just
check it, shall we?
Eh?
Uhh.
What are you doing?!
What the hell
are you doing?
You could say...
I've got money to burn.
Abby: Neil! Why are
you doing this?
Jesus!
Please don't! Stop!
Neil: Christ,
what are you, crazy?!
Stop it! Stop it!
My money! What the hell
are you doing?!
Please stop!
Please! Please!
That's our money burning!
Abby: Stop it!
For Christ's sake!
Neil.
God!
Left. Go left.
Neil: Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.
People are going
to be wondering
Where you are right now,
so...
Why don't you
call your boss
And tell him
you're going to be late?
Late?
You still might
make it, Neil.
Karl.
Hey, it's Neil.
Yeah, I got delayed.
Abby wasn't
feeling so great,
But I'll be there
as soon as I can.
No, no.
You can give me
directions
When I get closer,
ok?
Yeah. Yeah, sure.
Thanks. Bye.
So what more
do you want?
You.
You.
Westside. Now.
Dan, hi. It's Abby.
I don't think
I'm going to make it.
Neil,
That place over there.
Neil:
they know me.
I've taken
clients there.
Well, now you're taking
a new client.
Hi, uh...
Mr. Randall.
good afternoon, sir.
Pleasure
to see you again.
Now, um,
We have a table for three,
please?
Right this way.
May I take
your coats?
It's all right.
Waiter: What can
I get you to drink?
Nothing, thank you.
Ahh, good bottle
of wine. Red.
Something around,
uh, 200 bucks.
Yes, sir.
And these prices--
What would
you recommend, Neil?
Who do you think you are?
Oh, that's easy.
Right now,
I'm god.
Abby:
please just tell us
What you want us
to do.
You know,
people are always saying
They'd do anything
for their kids.
Anything.
So I'm going
to put that to the test.
For the next 24 hours,
you're mine,
Then you get her back.
You got it?
Hmm.
Waiter:
can I take your order?
Yeah, I guess--
I guess you got
steak in here.
Yes, sir.
Steak Dauphinoise.
Ok. That'll do. Yeah.
Um, rare. Thank you.
Sir?
Oh, they're not eating.
Yeah,
that's right.
You gotta run.
That's right.
Ahem.
Excuse me.
What do you mean
we've gotta run?
Well, we gotta pay
for this somehow.
And I'm all out of cash.
So what are we supposed
to do about that?
You're going to walk
out of here right now.
You're not going to talk
To your buddy
on the door,
And you're going
to go get some.
And if you're
not back here by 5:30
With say, 300 bucks,
Well, you know
what they say.
Never pick a fight
with someone
Who's got
nothing to lose.
Run along.
That's good.
Who you calling?
Kristin.
That designer
I met last month.
Who?
Kristin.
Will you ever listen
to anything I say?
She's 4 blocks
from here.
Voicemail.
No answer.
There's gotta be
someone else
We know around here.
We don't know anyone
on this side of town.
How does he know
about our lives?
What have we done
to him?
We haven't
done anything, babe.
Ok? He's just crazy.
That's what it is.
Do you know him from work?
Tell me.
Is it from accounts?
Somebody you pissed off?
No. What enough
that he'd take our kid?
I don't think so.
No way.
We've only got 15 minutes.
Oh, god.
Listen to me.
Listen to me.
He's got to get the money.
Please. Uh,
this is important. It's--
Neil!
Neil!
We really need your help.
Please listen to us.
My name is Neil Randall.
And, uh,
This is my card.
This is my wife.
Ok, we need--
we need money.
We're not begging.
Ok, if you could just--
Oh, I'm late
for a meeting.
No. No, you get back.
Our daughter could--
No, don't!
Our daughter could die
if you don't help us.
If you don't take
your hands off of me
In the next 2 seconds--
Neil, let him go.
Let's go.
I have an idea.
I have an idea!
'Scuse me. 'Scuse me.
We need to sell
this bracelet.
I paid 2 grand for that.
We only
need 300.
Yeah.
Ok.
Come on. We gotta go.
It's a fake.
Give you 20 bucks.
What?
It's not a fake.
Are you kidding me?
Baby, I paid
Stop.
Shopkeeper:
I was kidding. Kidding.
I'll give you 200, ok?
Funny. 300.
Oh, forget it.
Yeah. Well, there's
just one little thing.
I can't forget it.
Neil:
come on. We got 2 minutes.
This way.
aah!
Where'd he go?
S-sir?
Where did he go?
He was sitting
right there.
I--I'm sorry, sir.
I didn't see, um...
The man, he was
sitting right there.
Uh, I'm sorry, I--
Come on.
You must have!
Hey.
Dead on time.
Now this place
ain't bad.
I might bring
the good wife here, huh?
Settle this up,
would you, Neil?
'Scuse us.
So you got it?
Yeah.
Quite
a performance.
Let's see if you can
get to south frank
Within 20 from here.
I need this
delivered in person.
What's this?
What's going on?
Go and check the station
after it's done.
Just a little errand
for Abby, Neil.
Calm down.
What is it?
I don't know.
easy, hey.
I want to get to know you
a little better.
We might have something
in common--
For Christ's sake.
It's all right.
Neil.
I can do it.
I can deliver
a letter, ok?
Ok, ok. You go.
Take care, ok?
You're not worried,
are you?
She might see a cop.
Start getting ideas.
No, she'll do it.
Uhh.
Abby!
Wait. Leave it.
Leave it.
You son of a bitch!
Just leave it, ok?
All right?
Anger's good, Neil.
Come on.
Come on. Let's go.
Let's go.
Boy: Hey!
Hey!
Hey.
One word
and your daughter's dead.
Hey.
Dad.
It's good to see you, son.
How are you?
What are you
doing here?
Uh, well, I just, uh,
Had to come in for work,
And, uh,
Well, what about you?
I mean, I wouldn't
expect to see you
On the Westside.
Kory, that girl
I met
in social studies.
She lives just
down the street, so.
Good.
Good.
Is, uh,
everything ok?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Oh, just work, job.
I got a lot on my mind
and stuff.
Listen, we gotta run.
I'll catch you
later on, ok?
Yeah, sure.
Could you--
uh, use a ride, or...
Yeah.
Neil.
Have you forgotten
something?
If you're late?
Huh?
Your wife'll kill you.
Yeah, I forgot.
I'm sorry, son.
We're pushed for time.
I'll talk
to you later, ok?
Sure.
So you got
a child of your own
And you put us
through this.
What's he going to think
of the two of you
When this comes out?
Have you thought
about that?
Hey, what's he going
to think, huh?
Tell me.
Come on.
What's he going to think?
What's he going
to tell Kory
When mom and dad
are on the evening news?
Have you thought
about that?
Well, have you?
What the hell
are you doing?!
Uhh.
How's everything
going at work?
I hear advertising's
a cutthroat business.
A lot of pressure.
Is that why you screw up
so many people's lives?
What are you talking about?
Recognize that place?
Fifth floor.
Straight ahead.
That's the head office
of Magris industries.
You've heard of them?
Of course you have.
And with this
Million dollar launch
coming up,
I'm sure
this is something
You'd want to keep
under wraps.
What do you get for
hacking into
Corporate information
these days?
Where'd you get this?
Ah, don't panic.
It's only a copy.
Abby has the original.
Yeah,
it's all down there
In black and white.
Times, places.
How you bought your way
into getting that account.
What would
the competition do
With something like that?
Your company's reputation
will be ruined.
But Karl
won't blame you, Neil.
Will he?
Well, Mr. Carver's
due back any minute,
But I can give it
to him for you.
No, it's ok.
I've got to really give it
to him myself, thank you.
Sure. Have a seat.
You just want to destroy
everything we've got,
Don't you?
Look, I don't want
to destroy you, Neil.
I'll prove it.
I'll give you one shot.
Stop her.
You serious?
Stop her.
Uhh. Come on. Come on.
Shit!
Hello?
Abby? It's--
It's Neil.
Abby, don't hand over
that envelope.
What?
Look,
I--I don't have time
to explain.
Just walk out
of the office, ok?
We have to do
what he says, Neil.
Think about Sophie.
Get out of there,
Abby, please.
No, listen to me.
We have to do what he said.
Get out of there!
Look, he says
it's all right.
All right.
Time's up.
Oh, no. Abby, no!
Excuse me.
Are you Mr. Carver?
No! Abby,
for Christ's sake, no!
No! Don't!
Abby, for Christ's sake!
I said don't!
Shit!
Go on.
You know
you're dying for one.
Been thinking
about something you said
In that restaurant.
Do you know what it was?
"I'm Mr. Randall,"
you said.
Maybe it's just me,
But there's
something about you,
Or anyone,
Calling themselves mister
That makes me feel
kind of...
Sick.
You know what I mean?
Yeah.
You think you can
rely on someone,
And then she just...
You're pathetic.
By comparison to you,
Neil,
Of course I'm pathetic.
I mean,
you've got everything.
Great job, nice...
House.
Terrific wife.
Shit.
I was going to say
lovely daughter.
Hey. Let's see
how she's doing.
Hey. It's me.
Any problems?
Good.
Right.
She's watching cartoons.
Let me speak
to my daughter!
All right.
I'll check in later.
Keep the door locked.
Here you go.
She's an attractive woman,
Neil.
Don't be hard on her.
I'm so sorry.
I had to do it.
No. I know.
I didn't know
Listen, I've got
to pick something up.
You stay here.
Why didn't you do
what I--
What I told you?
Because I do
what he tells me to do
Until he says otherwise.
You know what?
It doesn't matter.
I wasn't going
to put Sophie in danger.
Not in danger.
He told me to stop you.
Yes, but
if I had done that,
Who knows
what he would have said?
Abby,
he's playing with us.
Don't you get that?
Yes, I get that.
Well, that's a good girl.
Don't patronize me.
And don't stand there
pretending that
Your precious career
doesn't matter.
Oh, you mean the thing
that keeps you in luxury?
Yeah, playing blocks
with Sophie
For the past 6 years
has been luxury.
Well, I'm real sorry, babe,
if bringing up your child
Has been such
a pain in the ass to you.
I didn't say that,
and by the way, Neil, honey,
She's our child!
This is what he wants.
Oh, screw you.
No, this is
what he wants.
Stop.
Listen to me.
I have been listening
To you my whole life.
Do you get it?
My whole life!
No, you listen to me!
You listen to me.
Why don't you
just go back to Denver?
It's a really great time
to bring that up, baby.
Really great.
I'm sorry.
Neil, his phone.
He just called the sitter.
We can
get the number, quick!
Hurry up.
Hurry up.
He's coming,
he's coming.
I'm not going
to let that asshole--
Put it down,
put it down!
I want this delivered.
There will be a nice
surprise waiting for you.
Take the train.
One hour there and back.
What is it?
I'll wait here.
No.
What did you say?
I think you heard me.
Neil, come on.
Don't worry
about it, Abby.
I think,
underneath it all,
He's really quite
the family man.
You're really beginning
to annoy me, Neil.
But anger is good, right?
Really beginning
to piss me off.
What exactly are you
going to do about that--
Abby: Stop!
Please, get off.
Please, stop.
Will this do you,
boyo, huh?
Will this do you?
Please, no!
He'll do it.
That box. One hour.
It's ok...
Are you ok, baby?
Are you ok?
It's ok.
I'm ok,
I'm ok.
Woman over p.A.:
final boarding call
For the express
to new York city...
Baby, we can't,
it's too dangerous. Please.
Yeah.
What's he trying
to do to us, huh?
He's wiping out
our lives.
Bit by bit.
I'm calling
that number.
No. Are you crazy--
After he dialed,
the first thing
He said was "827."
Now, why would
he say that?
It's gotta be
a hotel room.
What if
he's watching?
It's a hotel,
Allerton Crowne Plaza.
I knew it.
This could be
the only chance we get.
It's 8 blocks
from here.
May I help you?
We've got an hour.
Excuse me.
I'm sorry,
this is an emergency.
Excuse me.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Woman: Oh, come on,
are you serious?
Abby: Oh, god,
what's next?
Neil: Abby,
I'm not going to wait
To find out what's next.
I'm opening it.
Neil...
I gotta do it, baby,
I gotta find out.
The whole thing's
a mind game, Abby.
Don't worry.
We'll get her back.
Come on.
Good evening. Welcome to
the Allerton Crowne Plaza.
Can I help you?
Have you seen...
They're here.
Dark haired,
With a little girl
in a pink sweatsuit.
They checked in today.
All right.
They said that
the little girl
Seemed really quiet.
keep her talking.
Is there
a dry cleaning service here?
Woman: Yes,
ma'am, there is.
Oh, good.
Honey.
Honey,
We really
ought to get going.
Thank you so much.
We'll take the stairs.
Abby: 825.
It's the next one.
It's going
to be on that side.
Shh.
it's a TV.
Wait here.
No.
You need
to wait here.
Be careful.
I'm calling the cops
if anything happens, ok?
Boy on TV: The space
beneath the rock is vacant,
She who gives--
Girl on TV:
I want my diary!
Second boy on TV:
speaking of vacant,
Anybody seen
dork, dorkk, and dorky?
Second boy: Wow!
Good thing that problem
Cleared up, huh, Edd?
Edd: Enough
is enough, eddy.
My mind is riddled with
unpleasant images.
I implore you. Please,
I could use
some help here!
That's it! I suggest we
sneak back to the house,
We bury the book
within its boundaries,
And deceptively plead
amnesia.
Eddy: I like that!
Double d,
that's so underhanded!
oh, yeah.
You're right.
Oh.
You think you can
get away with anything
Because you're just
that bit smarter
Than the rest of us.
Huh?
Tell me something, Neil.
How does it feel
to be played, huh?
We're just trying
to save our daughter.
Abby!
Where is she?
Where is she?
How come you didn't
have another one, Abby?
Hmm?
I'm not sure you're
The perfect wife you'd
like to think you are.
Hmm? I'm not sure
you even any better--
Bastard!
Neil: Leave her alone!
Don't you touch her.
look at me. Are you ok?
Here you go.
Put it on, Abby.
See, huh?
Want to put this on?
No.
Come on, Abby,
put it on.
Put it on.
Take it.
You'll pay for this.
Put it on.
She's not doing it.
Why not, huh?
I said
she's not doing it!
Why not?
She might like it.
I said
she's not doing it!
No, Neil.
You're not putting
your big dick pride
Before your kid,
are you?
Please, stop. Don't...
I'll do it.
I'll do it, I'll do it.
Tom: Come on, Abby.
Come on.
Come here, come here.
Stay there, now.
I think
she's enjoying this.
Danger.
Yeah.
Acting out the victim.
This is the most alive
she's felt in years.
Yeah,
Let's put the dress on.
Oh, yeah, that's it.
She smells good.
Smells real good.
When this is over,
I will kill you.
Yeah, yeah,
but it isn't over,
Is it, Neil?
No.
You be there
at 8:00.
Otherwise, you'll never see
either of them again.
Be where?
Be where at 8:00?
The answer's
right here, Neil,
Staring you in the face.
You're hitting
the big time, now.
Let's see if you
can make it to the top.
What are you
talking about?
Why don't you
have a scotch
While you figure it out?
Neil!
Tell me where,
for Christ's sake!
Be where?
Prick!
Come on. Hurry up.
Unh!
Come on!
You just want
your life back.
What do you think?
Well,
Get out
of the car then.
Shit.
Hit the big time...
Shit.
Oh, oh, shit.
Yeah?
Tom: Missing you
already.
I made it.
I'm at the clock tower.
Too late.
No, no, no,
I did what you asked.
I--I--I got here.
You're too late.
Jesus Christ.
What do you want from me?
It's not all bad.
I'll let you say
good-bye.
What? No, wait.
Abby: Neil? Neil?
Baby, listen.
Neil, listen, he's got--
Tom: Time's up.
W-where are you?
W-what are you
going to do?
Come and take
a look, Neil.
Where?
The edge, Neil.
Just step up to the edge
and look down.
Ok...Ok...
You're not scared,
are you?
A little bird
told me
You're not crazy
about heights.
I'm at the edge.
I'm at the goddamn edge!
Abby really wanted
one last look.
No, wait, wait.
But if you haven't
got the balls--
I can't even see you.
You're not
at the edge, Neil,
Or we'd see you.
I want
to see you standing.
Wait, wait!
Ok, ok, I--
I see you.
Stand up, Neil.
Abby: No...
Get up.
No.
Neil, get up.
Please,
don't do this.
Be a real man
for once in your life.
Unh...
I'm here.
I'm...
Tell him to move back.
It's too dangerous.
I'm on the edge.
Tell him to move back.
That's enough!
No, please,
he'll kill himself.
That's enough!
Listen to me!
Abby: no!
Don't you touch her!
Get in the car.
Stay in here.
Stay in there.
Listen, it doesn't matter
that you were late.
I was going
to have her anyway.
Only she
doesn't know that yet.
Neil:
why are you doing this?
Why are you
doing this to me?
Why? Why...
Haven't you seen it yet?
Huh, Neil?
What are
you talking about?
The answer is up there.
Ah, it's right there.
Look around.
Where?
It's under your nose.
Come on, you want
to know why, don't you?
Aah!
What does it mean?
Tom: I'll tell you
what it means.
It means
stamping out a problem.
Crushing it.
So, now I've got
your daughter and your wife.
And you're just
a tiny dot in the sky
Worth nothing.
Please, no,
I'm begging you, don't.
And what exactly
am I going to do?
I'll leave that to
your imagination, Neil.
Don't you hang up!
Don't you hang up!
Sweet dreams.
A-Abby!
Abby!
Hey, whoa!
I need help.
Yeah, the line's
back there, sir.
No, this is
an emergency.
My--my wife and child
have been kidnapped.
There's a psycho out there,
Ok, he--he's taken
my wife and my little girl.
You got my car,
he's driving my car.
He--it's a range rover,
"r"-"u", uh, 83--83 "a."
And there--he's got
a woman who's helping him.
She's--
Pretending
to be a sitter?
Randall, right?
Your name is Neil Randall?
Yeah.
I just spoke
to your wife.
She was here.
What?
W-wait, when?
About half
an hour ago.
You spoke--
you spoke to my wife?
Yeah.
She's ok?
She explained
the whole thing.
Ok.
She said that
you might show up
With this story.
At the state
you're in,
You'll try anything
to stop her.
Stop her doing what?
Leaving you.
No, you don't
understand.
No, she's
not leaving me.
No, he made her
say that.
Ok? He's got
the whole thing planned.
He's smart. Oh, he--
he's smart, all right.
He, uh--he's got
our daughter.
And he's made us--
forced us to do
Everything he says.
Look, I get it.
I know how you feel.
My wife left me
a year ago
I went a bit--
crazy myself.
I'm not some
jealous husband, all right?
I'm the victim
of a crime!
Look,
you've been drinking.
I'm not drunk.
He did this to me.
Do yourself a favor.
Go home, sober up.
Try and accept it,
all right?
Nothing for me to do.
Can't help you.
All right?
Let's go,
I'll walk you out.
It's all right. Oh!
Oh, baby.
It's ok!
It's ok.
Are you ok?
He didn't touch me.
You promise me?
Yes, I promise.
He made me lie
to that cop.
I thought you were going
to fall off the building.
I thought you
were going to die.
Oh, baby.
Oh, baby
I thought I'd lost you.
I thought--
I thought
I'd lost everything.
It's ok.
Remember that feeling!
'cause the next time
I tell you to do something
You're going to do it,
right?
Right, Mr. Randall?
Good, now we understand
each other.
Get in the back.
Abby: Why don't
we just do it?
Whatever it is.
Yeah.
I love you, Abby.
You know that, right?
look what it takes
for us to get this close.
You guess where
you're going yet?
Just tell us.
We're going where you
were going all along.
We're going
to meet the boss.
The top man.
Karl granger.
I knew
it had something
To do with work.
Maybe.
Jesus. I don't know
anything, anymore.
Home sweet home.
You first, now.
Just ease the way.
What do I tell him?
Just tell him the truth.
Get out.
just do it.
Hey, Neil.
There something
I forgot to ask you.
What?
How far
would you go?
What?
To save the things
most important to you.
How far?
I would do
whatever it takes
To protect my family.
Yeah, I can
understand that.
And that's
a great thing.
There's this
one last thing
I want you to do.
Go on.
I want you
to kill, Neil.
You wanted to know
what this was all about.
Well, this is it.
No. You are crazy.
I can't do that.
You don't have to.
But if you don't...
You'll never see
Sophie again.
Because believe
one thing,
I don't give a damn
what happens to me.
I can't--I can't--
Neil, there's
no debate here, ok?
There's one person
in that house
And if they're not dead
In the next 10 minutes,
Someone else will be.
Have you forgotten
that feeling already?
Oh, Jesus.
You scared the life
out of me.
Judy?
I just took a shower.
I was beginning to think
you weren't going to make it.
Mmm.
God, Neil,
you look awful.
What happened?
You were stuck with Abby
when you called,
Weren't you?
Is she ok?
Yeah.
She's ok.
Well, she bought
all that stuff
About going to Karl's,
didn't she?
Yeah, she trusts me.
Yeah.
Anyways, let's get
this jacket off.
No, no.
It's cold out there.
Ok.
Well, come in
by the fire, then.
The usual?
Yeah--yeah, thanks.
So, how did you
find the place?
I thought you
were going to call.
I know what's wrong.
It's a long drive,
Plenty of time
to discover a conscience.
Look, Neil, don't you
think I felt guilty, too?
But we've had
all these months
Of watching our backs.
Going to
our little french restaurant,
In the afternoons.
Now, finally,
we can just relax
And enjoy each other.
Right?
I don't know.
Neil.
Neil?
Look, have I done
something wrong?
No.
Well, then,
what is it?
It's nothing.
Well, it's got
to be something.
Who is that?
That's my husband
Tom.
I guess now
you can put a face
To the name.
Where is he right now?
You know
where he is.
He's on
that hunting trip.
That's why
we're here.
God, anyway, what's
with the sudden interest
In Tom?
You've never given
a damn before--
What do you think
he would do,
If he found out?
He's not going
to find out.
Answer me!
Just what would Tom do?
I don't know
what he'd do.
It would
destroy him.
Christ!
Why are we even
talking about this?
He's got Sophie.
What?!
Your husband
has my child!
Why would Tom
have Sophie? What--
Because he knows
about us!
What?
He knows
everything, Judy.
Tom knows.
baby.
He's going to kill her.
What?
If I don't...
If you--if you don't
what? What?
Baby,
you're scaring me.
He says,
he's going to kill her--
What are you--
if I don't--
Doing with a...
no!
No!
Neil, don't!
Get off of me!
No! No!
I can't.
I can't.
Do it!
Tom!
Do it, Neil.
I can't!
No?
I can't.
Well, I can.
No!
A life for a life.
Just one little number.
Do it, now.
Do it, now.
Tom!
No!
Now! Do it!
No!
I'm sorry.
No, Neil!
No.
Now you see?
Huh?
How much
he really loves you.
You piece of shit!
Tom!
You piece of shit!
It was just--
Just?
That's a great word,
isn't it?
It was just one of
those office things.
Just fooling around.
Just an affair.
Just your cock
in her mouth!
The mouth that kisses me
good-bye in the morning.
But hey!
It's no big deal.
It's not a matter
of life and death.
But then,
you tell me,
What the fuck
ever is? Get up.
Well, hmm, you're not
such a bad guy, Neil.
I mean, you go to work,
You go to the gym,
you go home,
You pat your kid
on the head.
You screw your wife.
Then you screw mine.
The end
of a perfect day.
It wasn't her
you were screwing,
Was it? No.
It was me.
Me you got inside.
Huh?
So, come on, Neil.
Kiss me, huh?
Come on, kiss me!
Oh, you piece of shit!
No!
Tom!
No!
Please.
Stop.
oh.
I will.
I will.
Please.
Oh, god.
Where's my daughter?
She's at home,
where she belongs.
What's going on?
Huh, baby?
Are you all right?
We're getting
out of here.
Where is he?
It's over.
Please tell me
what's going on, Neil.
You were right.
It was work. He had
a grudge against Karl.
So, what was Judy
doing in there?
What?
I thought I saw Judy
at the window!
Look, I told you,
didn't I?
Ok, it was work.
Yes, but what was
Judy doing there?
Look, it's complicated!
This could cause
a lot of trouble
For the company--
The company--
Karl--
Are you kidding me?
You've got to be--
No, I'm not kidding!
Just tell me
what's going on, please.
You really want
to know the truth?
Yes.
You want to know
why he did it?
Yes! Just tell me!
It was me he was after.
Why?
He's Judy's husband.
And?
She's been having
an affair--
With Karl.
Only that maniac
Thought it was
with me.
Can you believe it?
No, what matters
right now is Sophie.
He said she's at home.
We just gotta get back.
Uh-huh.
Make sure she's ok.
Ok.
Yeah. Ok.
What are you doing--
what are you doing?
I need a cigarette.
I'll get it--
I'll get it.
Look down here,
I'll check upstairs.
Sophie?
Sophie?
Sophie.
Sophie.
Oh, god, baby
come here, come here.
Oh, baby.
Are you ok?
Daddy?
Yeah?
did she hurt you?
What?
The woman--
Who took you.
did she hurt you?
We played
hide-and-go-seek.
Oh, come here, baby.
Mommy and daddy...
Are going to be here
for you now.
Ok.
Ok.
Ok.
Abby, she's fine.
Abby?
Abby?
Abby: I know.
I know.
Abby...
baby. I never...
You know it.
Abby--
Go on.
Look me in the eyes
and lie to me again.
Oh, no. Lying.
I'm not lying--
Tell me
you love me.
I do love you, Abby.
Listen to me, Abby. Ok?
You and I, we--we can
work this out together.
We can get through this
And I'll make it up
to you.
But we--we almost lost
our daughter today.
And we have her back.
They took Sophie.
And we--
did they?
But you know--
Well,
you know they did.
Woman on telephone:
we're sorry.
Your call cannot
be completed as dialed.
Please check the number
And dial again.
We know it's just
a game, honey.
Ok, just do whatever
the lady says, all right?
Oh, Neil.
She never left
the house.
She had a nice day--
With a lovely sitter.
I made sure
that I got the best.
Only the best.
You set me up.
You set me up
from the start.
Little old me.
Can you believe it?
And you...
And you put me
through all of that?
How about this, Neil?
How about weeks
and months of knowing
You're not good enough?
Try that!
Abby!
It didn't
mean anything!
You gotta
believe me.
I do believe you.
I believe you.
But it meant
something to me.
And it meant
something to him.
Enough that you
would let him destroy
Every cent
we've worked for?
No, Neil.
Not every cent.
So, you just ruined
my career.
Did I?
Yes, I saw you
do that one, Abby.
And what
did you see, Neil?
None of it happened.
So you got it?
Yeah.
Quite a performance.
I found you out, Neil.
Just like I did
in Denver.
I have been
in so much pain.
Do you know
how that feels?
Watching you
sleep at night,
Watching you dream.
And knowing that
she watches you, too.
I'm done.
I get you.
I understand you.
But I don't want you.
Look, you still have
everything.
You still have
your house,
You still have
your career,
You'll always have
Sophie.
Everything's exactly
as it was.
Except for one thing.
Who breaks a butterfly
on a wheel?
I do, Neil.
I just wanted
to share those feelings
With you, if only
for a few hours.
Despair, loss,
Abandonment,
Betrayal.
Are they there, Neil?
Are they, baby?
Are they?
