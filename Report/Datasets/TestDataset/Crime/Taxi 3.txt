Don't touch it!
Are you free?
You are a good-looking man, but
my heart belongs to someone other.
Can l change the situation?
Oh! You enter into my feelings.
ls someone chasing you?
No. l just need transport to the
airport. Can you get there in 20
minutes?
to finish my sandwich. Get in.
Just some settings...
...and we'll discuss the news.
What about some music?
Ok, just start!
Ready: Start!
Marseille is a nice city.
And this is the right season.
- Yes, lucky me.
We are late. l have to accelerate.
- Put on your seatbelt please.
l'll switch to speed three.
- No problems.
- Are you OK?
- l'm fine.
- Was it Daniel?
- Who else. The prefect's mother?
He's fast. The cops cannot catch him!
Don't be so sure. They have received
a new arm.
A new arm? What kind of arm?
A secret one.
Damn it! 298 km/h!
Attention!
A white cab driving with 298 km/h.
l repeat: 298 km/h.
Understood, we are on the way.
Oh, l was worried, l thought
they were asleep.
- But this is a police car.
- No! Some friends of mine.
Very funny guys.
- Bertran, this is a strange registration.
- Get near.
''Go suckers, go!''
This is not a registration!
This is an e-mail...
Game over! Hold on.
Why are you stopping?
l am not stopping, he is
accelerating...
- Nitro?
- No, a friend of mine has a bar,
this is some kind of drink.
lfyou are interested, l'll
take some for you.
Thanks for the kindness.
Wait a bit, is this a TGV?
Yes. lt's a fast machine...
...but in this region it slows down.
- Mamma mia!
Where do you want to get out?
Here! Stop just here.
Are you OK. Usually the passengers
are OK until l drive.
They throw up when l stop.
There is a bag, you can use it.
Thanks!
- Are you sure that this is the
right place
- Absolutely.
ls this your plane?!?
Thanks for the collaboration.
Have we met before?
l don't think so, but if l see
you again, l'll remember!
Good luck!
Lily never won't believe me.
What's happening?
Nothing. l had a nightmare.
Go back to sleep darling.
What the hell are you doing?
Nothing, l just couldn't sleep for
Because ofthat gang?
Yes. Since 8 months they kid me.
l am losing my mind.
l see that. Since 8 months l
try to talk to you.
Yes, yes, but l have my own
problems.
- Did you hear me?
- Of course l did.
made by robbers, dressed like
Santa Claus. Can you imaginethat?
Yes, and now you don't believe
in Santa Clause.
l believe! No, l don't believe,
but it's not the problem.
Christmas comes, and the investigations
do not progress.
May be you feel the Christmas humour!
Petra, l have to catch that gang
before Christmas.
And me Emilian, l have to talk to
you before Christmas.
OK, we'll talk.
- What are you doing?
- l am going to the office.
But it's 3 o'clock in the morning!
That's ok. l'll avoid the
traffic.
- You are out ofyour mind!
- l am fine.
l'll see you in the office.
Wake up every one!
- Lily, honey! You can't sleep?
- l can't, because my boy friend
repairs his car at 4 o'clock in themorning.
There is nothing broken.
lt's winter.
l am making some modifications
to be stable on the road.
Listen to me! You have 5 minutes
to do something with the heating.
l am cold, because l am alonein the bed.
And ifyou want to know, you do
this all the seasons.
- Don't say that Lily...
- Don't touch me!
lt's not so easy...
You use me like a rag.
What do you mean?
You use me like something, which
cleans plates and pots. l am so
stupid.
Don't say that! l'll wash myself
and l'll join you.
No! l'll tell you how it will be.
You'll wash yourself, than you'll wait
for one hour to remove this disgusting
smell.
And then will come the time
to go to my work.
Today you are in good state to
kick up. l waked up at 2 o'clock.
l looked at you for one half hour.
Then l decided to make something useful,
instead to watch television.
Daniel! There is no TV set!
- This is not an argument! This is a principle.
- There is no TV, no music,
no curtains, no sofa,
no vase to put some flowers.
And l have no received any flowers
long time ago.
So there is a fridge, but it's
full of motor oil.
- Lily!
- There is a shower, and it smells
of gas...
There is a jack, to jack up your car.
And your wardrobe is full oftyres.
There is no room for my dresses.
- Lily!
But in our state, we can afford the
luxury...
to have a garage.
- What's wrong with you? ls this your
monthly period?
- No, it isn't!
l just can't live anymore in a garage!
l am a women. Do you remember
what it is?
lt's not something which only
smiles...
The women moves, thinks, evolves
and sometimes needs a little bit
of comfort.
And this is only because
l like the cars...
Women!
l can't get it. What a nice
aroma...
Lily, what are you doing?
- l'll return to my parents.
- You'll change the garage for a barrack?
A barrack with curtains, a small
garden and flowers on the table.
This is ridiculous. You can't
leave like that.
lt was amusing for you at the
beginning.
Yes, but it's not any more.
Yourjalopy is more important
for you, than me.
The garage is too small for
us. l made my decision.
Good buy.
Hello girls. Are you having
a walk?
Take it easy. l am just kidding...
l'll see you later.
Hi! Can l come in?
Did you sleep here?
No, l just drowsed for 5 minutes.
You have the file on your face.
l can tell you how long did you
sleep, because your face is like
a stump.
You know the trees. One circle,
one year...
Forget about it...
You know me. l always make jokes...
- That's what l am.
- May be l have to change you...
Hi guys. Would you like some grass?
lt's very good.
Oh, no, no...
- Don't be foolish. lt's high-quality.
- Really?
No, no. Who do you think we are?
OK. The choice is yours
Buy.
- Tell me...
- Hey! And some coke?
- Rashid!
- l am just asking.
- Right!
What are these shits?
And what are these posters on the wall?
- lt's Bob Marley.
This is a police station!
Do you know how long we are working
on this case without success?
- The gang of Santa Claus?
- The same.
lt's time to do something.
any track.
Nothing, that we can use.
We are useless fools...
Are you sure...
you don't want some stuff. l'll call
Rashid
- No.
That will help you feel better.
What about a breakfast?
Rh?
The breakfast gives energy.
Ok, let's go to have breakfast.
You have a good appetite.
l couldn't eat, l couldn't
sleep for months.
l have terrible nightmares. Many
Santa Clauses are walking around me.
lt's terrible.
- Say no more. lt's really terrible...
Lice up your shoe.
And Christmas is coming, they
can hide easily in the crowd.
- That's right. ln July it would be
more difficult for them.
- Yes, they couldn't escape...
And now Christmas is coming,
and l am sure, they are ready
for their biggest strike.
One question worries me: Why are
they disguised as Santa Claus?
Take a look!
He is nice, he gives presents,
he is reliable with these red
clothes...
...Everybody points at him...
From other point of view...
it's a perfect disguise...
...to simulate...
A gun!
You are interested in our new
mixers?
Will you come again?
Hey you!
Freeze!
Don't move! You are under arrest!
- What happened?
- He tried to escape, but l was
really fast.
How did you know, he is a fake
Santa Claus?
How many Santa Clauses have a gun
with them?
- A gun! How did you know?
- He let it fall, the fool.
- What a fool.
- Yes, silly fool.
Let's go to the commissariat.
Hello boss! Look who is here...
Shit! He is gone...
Lock up the nippers to the chair.
The boss is not here. Let's say,
that l am the boss...
- How do l look?
- Don't do that, he could be somewhere
here...
He is gone. lf he comes, l'll
take care...
Trust me!
Well Santa Claus. l know your
name. Tell me, how did you get
a police gun?
Did you steal it?
Find his address.
l'll try this book.
Any time you forget something,
my colleague will help you to
remember.
Did you see? He's professional.
You know, there is a registration
number here...
l'll enter it in the computer,
and l'll know the name ofthe
owner in one minute.
That fool! He stole the gun
from Giber!
- lmpossible!
- l swear. Take a look!
Did you know, that you have stole
this from the police chief?
Have you got an explanation?
He don't.
Do you think, he can speak
with sticking plaster on the
mouth?
You are right. Remove it.
Emilien?
Commissar?
Somebody calls me outside.
- What are you doing dressed like that?
- l am doing myjob, Emilien. l put on
these clothes to penetrate in thegang of Santa Claus.
But as usual you screw everything.
Sorry boss. l...
But why you didn't warn us.
We could disguise as Santa
Claus too.
Because it was individual precise
action. But don't worry.
l'll give you a special costume and
a truncheon. You could train on the
street.
- And now, would you unlock me!
- Of course commissar.
Damn it!
Alain got the keys.
- Hurry up Emilien.
- 5 minutes boss.
- Are you the commissar Giber?
- Not yet.
l mean, l am not yet a commissar,
and unfortunately my name is not
Giber.
- l mean, mostly my name is not
Giber.
- The keys Emilien!
ln a minute boss.
Are you the commissar Giber?
Yes. What can l do for you?
Good afternoon.
My name is Qiu.
Qiu, Qiu, what a nice name Qiu.
And what a nice queue you have!
ls this a chinese name?
Yes. My mother is chinese, and
my father - swiss.
l know very well Switzerland.
l am a journalist from World
lnternational Magazine.
l have to write an article about
the French police.
l want to follow closely the work
ofthe big commissars, and l heard,
you are the biggest.
That's right. 1 ,90 meters are too
many even for a policeman.
How impressive.
Yes. Sometime l make an impression
to myself.
- Can l ''stick'' on you for few days?
- All my life, ifyou want.
l mean, as long as needed
to make your article.
And you'll see how l work on
investigations.
Thanks a lot. Can we start?
With pleasure.
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.
What are you doing dressed
like Santa Claus in your
office?
Eh? This! This is a camouflage.
We are trying to catch a gang,
disguised as Santa Claus.
Dressed like that, we can penetrate
into it.
- And what are the nippers for?
- They are note mine.
An other question?
Come in.
- Do l disturb you?
- Nothing can disturb me anymore.
l see you are alone in the office,
you have nothing special to do,
and l would talk to you for 5minutes.
No Petra, lt's not the time.
Can we talk at home?
At home you think only about
your work. l thought in the office...
...we could discuss some domestic
problems.
Not today Petra.
Just not today.
Since 8 months you repeat ''Just
not today''
Listen, l am in the big shits,
don't do that to me...
What more happened after this
morning?
l caught a Santa Claus.
Santa Claus with a gun.
l thought he was from the gang.
- You don't need a Santa Claus or a gun
to think like that.
You always think about that.
- Yes, but there were both - a Santa Claus
and a gun.
l did it instinctively.
- And you disarmed him by yourself?
- Yes.
- Then everything is OK.
Absolutely not. lt was Giber.
OK, laugh at me.
l can lose myjob and you
are laughing...
- And what do you expect?
- Help me to relax.
Say something nice.
The good news help a lot.
Emilien! l am pregnant.
- No!
- Yes! Are these good news?
Of course. Since when?
- Since 8 months Emilien.
- No. -Yes
- How it happened?
- The Saint Spirit came to me
l saw the changes, but...
And your breasts...
...this is the reason to became so...
My God! Will you keep it?
- lt's too late for other decisions.
- Certainly.
- But why you didn't tell me?
- l try since 8 months.
l put cauliflower in all
the rooms.
- l was wondered what does it mean.
- Look, there are more than 20
echographic images on the wall.
There are everywhere.
- ls this my baby?
- For now it's mine.
lfyou want to take part, you have
to wake up!
ls the baby normal?
Good question, ifyou know the
father...
but yes, it's normal.
- lfyou are pregnant,
you'll keep the baby, and it's
normal...
then l'll became a father?
- Yes. Good conclusion.
- You should work at the police.
- l'll be a daddy.
Yes. And this child will need
a super-daddy.
Count on me Petra,
Count on me.
Lily!
What a fool you are.
You changed a car, for the woman
you love..
Fast test?
What fast test?
Two bars. What is this?
- Good afternoon. -Hello.
- Could you tell me what is this?
Just a moment.
Fast pregnancy test.
Was the prophylaxis efficacious?
l don't know.
You tell me.
Just a moment. l have to check
something.
We finished the blue condomes.
You know, a blue condome
and a baby. Women adore these
kind of presents.
Do l need a blue condom like a
present?
l have to ask my daughter.
She studies pharmacy, and she knows
the names of all the medicines by
heart. She is so impressive...
Angel! What does it mean?
l am sorry daddy! l was so
careful, l swear...
But l had nothing for protection.
Darling! lt's full of preservatives.
Why you didn't take some?
- There wasn't his size.
- Who did it to you?
- l don't know?
- You don't know? He has no name,
this young man?
l told you, l was drunk! l couldn't
remember all the names.
Good Lord!
Come on. Marry Christmas.
Every one, listen to me.
l am explaining, what we have to
do against the Santa Claus gang.
Me myself, l made a perfect
individual action, unfortunately
upset by Emilien.
But this is in the past. Let take
a look on the future.
We'll do all, that we have to do
tomorrow, starting today.
Don't write that.
lt's a little bit complicated.
l don't like the misunderstandings.
- The nonsenses start...
- Yes, he's genius.
- What was l talking about? -The plan...
- Yes, the plan of action.
And l won't accept mistakes anymore.
Don't write that.
l want everything to be ''clean''!
''Super-clean''!
Last summer l was on a training
course at the american police.
This is some kind of language
reflex.
Crazy, eh?
l would like to sayjust ''go''...
...and the Santa Claus gang to be
caught beforeîre Christmas.
No more vacations, absences for
reason of health...
...or domestic disturbances...
Especially as, miss Piu, eh Qiu,
who is journalist, will give us
the honour to participate in
this mission.
Let make a good impression
about the French police.
The basic aspects ofthe mission are:
Concentration, Reflection, Action.
l named the mission:
Operation: ''Snow-white''
ln French: Blanche Neige.
l was right about the nonsenses.
- Yes, he's genius.
- From now, l want every one
available 24 hours by the day.
- Couchon? -Me -You? -Yes. -îlh
- What is this on your desk, boss?
- A gift?
- Very kind. For my birthday?
- lt's when? ln July.
lt's for Christmas. -Whatever.
l'll open it now.
Let see.
- Very nice. lt's from who?
- Someone, who knows you well.
- Did you see the little push-button.
- Yes.
- Ah! Put the guns down!
- He's genius.
Hello. This is Santa Claus.
l'll be waiting for you at noon,
in front ofthe Europern Park.
There will be presents. Hurry up
and catch me.
- What time is it?
- lt's 5 to 12.
General alert!
l sad quiet! How to work with
these cretins?
Don't write this, miss Qiu.
lt's a typical french conversation.
But we don't think like that.
This is Giber! Deploy you and
wait for my signal. Go!
For sure, they will come out
from the garage ofthe bank
with a fast car.
Anyway we'll surprise them.
Boss, are you sure that this is
the right way?
Certainly! They sent us a message,
where they are. They thought, we won't
come.
This is because they don't know
me, the commissar Giber.
l am here, waiting for the trap.
But boss, ifthis is the trap.
We are here and they are somewhere
else, working without disturbances...
Think Emilien, think. There is
no sense.
Why should they tell us about
their new strike.
- This is stupid.
- That's the think, that worries me.
- Till now they didn't nothing stupid.
- There is always first time. Trust me!
- Unless...
- Unless what?
They are sure, the could escape...
Escape from me? lmpossible. ln
any case l'll catch them.
- Boss!
- Yes?
To come out from this bank, they
have to pass over us.
What is this?
lt's, it's...
- Boss, are you ok?
- Yes, l am fine.
Why don't you start the pursuit?
- With these car?
- How should l know. lnvent
something. You have no imagination?
Confiscate a car!
l don't get it. He shown his
identities. Why they didn't
stop.
No one in Marseille stops if
there is a cop on the road.
They could slow down...
l am ok! Ok.
- Boss, we can use the other cars!
- You are right, Emilian! Get in the cars!
This is a unique security system.
lt's connected with the police
network.
lf necessary, you push on this
button, and the nearest police
car comes in a minute.
lt works.
- You have no eyes?
- You scratched my car.
Damn it!
Oh, my car!
Boss, this pursuit made a lot
of damages!
or less, what's the difference.
Go, go!
We are going to port Marseille.
There are some historical monuments...
...builded by Louis XVll
in year 1661 ... Attention!
The car!
- Do you follow the situation?
- Certainly!
- Louis XVll in year 1661 ...
- l didn't mean that!
Follow the car with the big
tyres from the front.
Oh-la-la...
Always staff problems.
This young man for example, is
a good swimming instructor,
but he drives car like he has no
driving license...
- And does he have a license?
- No. l started working yesterday!
- But this is impossible!
- Calm down, Emilian. lt's a
simple task. He just has to
follow that car. Piece of cake,
even for a swimming instructor.
- What should l do?
- Just follow them.
l know this kind of machines.
The fuel consumption is 100l/100km.
- lt will stop in 5 minutes.
- lfwe don't catch them in 5 minutes.
We will.
We disturbed a lot of people.
Don't worry. lt happens in France...
- But there are damages.
- Stop repeating the same!
- They disappeared!
- What, that is impossible!
- May be they are in the pool.
- That's better.
- Stop!
lt was really close.
Eh! Watch your steps!
Can we survive 5 minutes.
Sure. lt's water resistant.
ls it always like that in the French
police?
Absolutely not. ln the most cases
the cars leak.
Boss! l can't swim!
Don't worry!
There is a swimming instructor.
Ah, the little Daniel. lt's a pleasure
to see you.
l'll tell you something.
You meet too often my daughter.
Just kidding! lt's normal. Have
fun.
Did you see my chauffeur.
He is late.
l saw him at the crossroad.
He'll be here in few minutes.
- Very well.
- ls Lily at home?
Yes. Lily! Sorry darling,
l didn't see you.
lt's ok. l've got used.
- Look who is here.
- Hello Lily. May l speak to you?
Not now. l am going to my doctor.
- Daddy, would you take me there.
lt's on the way.
- Sure, if my chauffeur appearssome day...
You know, l think he has some
problems.
- Should l take you?
- Affirmative.
Get in the car!
- Boulevard Cassini chauffeur.
- Very well madame.
Where were you. Daniel will
take us...
Go back to the barrack!
- l think you drove faster before.
- Who, me? But now is rush hour,
there is a lot of people, there are
too many cops. There is nothing wrong
driving slow sometimes.
- l agree, but l am late.
- What? What happens?
- l have pains! -Where?
- ln the abdomen.
- The abdomen? But it's terrible!
What should we do general?
How should l know? ls it so bad
darling?
- No-o. l am fine.
- You are fine? -l am fine.
She is fine.
She is fine...
Daniel, why are you so nervous.
What's wrong?
lt's because of Christmas. All
that people, the presents...
l see.
And what is this think on your
ear?
Nothing. lt's a new kind of
thermometer. lt's really fast.
One bar: ok.
Two bars: too bad.
- But there are two bars.
- l know! May be this is the problem.
Thanks for driving.
lt was very pleasant.
See you later darling.
l am not a doctor, but your heart seams
to be desperate.
l understand your indisposition,
but l am still late.
Ready: Start!
Come in.
- Cuckoo!
- Hello!
- Are you ok?
- l am fine.
You see, our equipment betrays us.
How to work normally?
Don't write that:
We need new chairs,
the doors are not tall enough...
We have also car problems.
You saw, did you?
And the shoes are so small.
l feel terrible pains.
- But this is a shoe-pad!
- Oh! Someone played a practical
joke on me.
By now 6 months have passed since l
have walking problems.
lt's not funny!
Relax commissar!
You are so nervous.
lt's because ofthat gang. The Santa
Claus gang...
Don't think about it!
l'll take care ofyou.
- Are you familiar with this?
- Yes, a little.
lt was delivered last week.
Unfortunately, they took my
typewriter.
Relax commissar.
ln 5 minutes l'll brighten you.
- You think so?
l am sure.
Ok, but for now l can't see.
ls it normally?
Yes, it is!
Relax!
l feel good...
l feel, like somebody empties me.
lt's just like that.
- l am afraid, l'll fall asleep.
- l'll wake you up.
R-r-rh!
lt was formidable.
Hey! What are you doing? Do you
know where you are?
- No. Where am l?
- ln front ofthe commissariat!
- ls it true? Well, l have to park somewhere!
- l am in no laughing mood.
- My compliments, general.
- Stay easy!
Thank you Daniel. l'll see you
this evening at home.
Daniel! Thank God you are here.
- Can l command your services?
- No! But like a friend, l'll
take you anywhere.
l am so glad to see you.
- Tell me! ls it everything ok now?
- Yes, you can go.
And could you keep this parking
place vacant. l'll be back.
Yes, right.
- Step on the gas! l am late.
- Yes boss.
- You can't imagine what happened
to me.
- Similarly you can't imagine whathappened to me.
- You simply can't imagine it?
- A promotion?
lt's not about myjob!
lt's personal. Come on, guess!
- You'll get married?
- Better! l'll become a father.
- That's impossible!
- lt's possible!.
- You are genius.
- Lily is pregnant too.
That's impossible!
We are genius.
We'll become fathers together.
lt's amazing. We are friends
for years. And now we'll have,
a baby together.
l mean separately...
...but at the same time.
- Everyone has his baby, and his
place.
Exactly.
- Since when Petra is pregnant?
- Since 8 months.
- You could tell me till now!
- She told me this morning.
You are the first, who learns.
Even mamma doesn't know yet. And since
when Lily is pregnant?
- 2 bars.
- What do you mean?
You make the test, and it lets
you know how much you are pregnant...
Lily is pregnant 2 bars.
- lt's cool.
- Yes, it's cool.
Commissar!
You have a visit.
What are you doing, Giber?
R-r-r, it's a pleasure to see you.
Nothing! We just...
This is a colleague of mine,
from China. She was explaining
me a way, to save my time.
sleep. lt gives energy.
However the course is finished.
See you soon commissar.
Thanks.
Thanks my little Qiu.
So, what can l do for you?
There was cauliflowers everywhere
in my office, but l didn't
understand the meaning.
- lt's a big misunderstanding.
- Yes, you had to guess earlier.
- Why cauliflower?
- l don't know, may be it's a symbol
offatherhood...
lt was really a big mistake, Daniel.
Calm down. lt's not so bad.
You just don't know what the
cauliflower symbolizes...
- You think so?
- Sure! Petra will understand you.
- Thanks. Now l am calm.
- Don't be so calm,
you couldn't be sure with a future
mother.
- What do you mean?
During this period, they are
unpredictable.
Crisis could happen.
And the children, l think, that
they will occupy some place.
And time.
We definitely have to change
our way of live.
You are right. We'll need time to
take them at sckoll.
That will be later. At the beginning
you'll have to hide the electrical
wall-plugs with sticking plaster.
- l'll have to do that?
- Exactly!
lt's a little bit otherwise, that
l was imaging.
- Did Rashid give you this shit?
- Yes.
- Do you know Rashid?
- A little.
The sun rises.
Tell me Daniel, Santa Claus
driving a scooter, isn't a little
bit strange?
Yes, normally it has to be
a sledge.
Follow him discretely.
Stop thinking about yourjob!
May be that brings your problems.
- Follow him.
- At your orders... Commissar!
Check out a scooter, registration
N 75BM13, over.
- The scooter was stolen 2 weeks ago.
- Yes, l knew it, follow him.
- You better call Petra.
- Daniel, we'll follow him,
then we'll call Giber,
and he'll be in charge ofthis
case. You have my word.
-ie.
- l was waiting for some traces
so long.
- Would you stop that shit.
- Certainly.
Damn it! The first trace for months,
and l'll lose it!
Calm down. Each problem has a
solution.
What are you doing?
- Daniel, what's wrong with you!
- l am solving your problem. Any comment?
- No! But how do l stay like that?
- Bend your knees.
What?
Ok, ok.
Well. You saw where he entered.
Now call the commissar!
Bla-bla! Stop talking.
l'll check out the situation.
Hey! You have a Santa Claus,
a stolen scooter and an abandoned
storehouse.
What do you need more?
His legal file?
l'll take a look!
- Bingo.
- Why don't you check for
plastic explosive?
Very funny. Let change our
position.
Follow me.
Why don't you call the commissar?
We had a deal.
Because his first question will be:
How many are they?
l need to know. lt's the principle.
Emilien, l have a bad feeling
about this. Don't do it!
Really? Go home then. lt's
my duty and l'll do it.
That worries me!
- l am worried only by Giber.
- Emilien. Enough!
Goodness!
- Hello.
- l went to my doctor today.
Are you interested?
- lf he's a good doctor, l am interested.
- He's an excellent doctor.
He was recommended by the prefect's
daughter. She has 4 children.
- We can beat her.
- l don't think l'll see you
again.
Lily! l'll do my best. Don't
say that.
Why do you whisper?
Because of several Santa Clauses.
They are here, around the dust-bin.
Lily! Lily!
Damn it!
- What are you doing here?
- Guess.
You waste your time. l'll say
nothing. l can stand any tortures.
Nobody force you talking.
We already know everything. And
the tortures are out offashion.
There are more effective methods
to make a man talking.
No kidding?
The tenderness for example.
lt can be very dangerous arm.
You are a pretty man. What do you
do in the police.
l do myjob. Ah, don't do that.
l don't see any reasonable argument
against my opinion.
- Stop it! it's my mobile.
- Let see!
Oh, what a nice model!
- l think the battery is discharged.
- Don't do that!
You have no soul!
You are inhuman.
The hungerjustify the methods.
And l am very hungry.
- Petra!
- l can't answer the call, because
l am very, very busy.
Leave a message, and l'll call you
back later.
Emilien, this is Petra. l suppose
you are on a mission.
You have to know, that l
entirely trust you.
l know how much you love your
job, and how much energy you
put in work.
l think it's time to take care of
yourself.
Take some rest, have fun.
We must spend more time together.
That's all. Call me back when you
finish. Kisses.
Hello Daniel.
lt's you again. Did you see
Emilien somewhere.
Yes actually! l drove him
free of charge.
- You drove him. Where?
- He followed a Santa Claus.
- From the gang?
- l don't know, but l suppose so.
This Emilien. He found the gang's
traces quite alone.
- Actually l was with him.
- Ok. We'll follow the plan.
- And Emilien?
- l'll take care of him!
Stay around. Well need you
for this mission.
- And Emilien?
- We'll find him before Christmas.
But l don't know in what shape...
lt's very promising.
- Commissar!
- Ah. Just in time. We are on the
gang's track.
We'll bring them to their knees.
- Shall l come with you?
- Absolutely not. lt's an arrest,
not a Christmas party.
Please, commissar.
Ok. Let's go. lt's not far away.
Hey! Follow us.
Deploy you!
The Christmas mood is everywhere.
lt's time to catch that gang.
- How did you know they are here?
l have my own spying ring. My
brother, Jean-Robert. We went up
together for the police examination,
but he failed. And he copied
everything from me, but he
forgot to write his personalnumber...
That happens often. A friend of
mine...
- Ok. Enough!
And he called me last night,
and told me about a suspicious
activity in an underground passage.
l made an investigation, and
l found a tunnel between the bank
and the big stores.
So they will steal the turnover
ofthe big stores.
No! They'll wait till Sunday morning,
and they'll rob the bank, dressed like
Santa Claus.
They'll penetrate trough the stores,
which are opened on Sunday.
- Exactly. And nobody gives attentionto them.
Yes! This is the reason the gang's
members to be disguised as Santa Claus.
Because ofthat they rob in
Marseille the last 8 months
without disturbances.
They are smart, but you commissar,
you are genius.
No, no. l would say:
lt's a matter oftraining.
- Can l make a phone call?
- Sure.
Ah! Emilien has the same phone
set.
Yes.
The stupid cops found out
everything. Switch to plan B.
- Okay. Buy.
- What a nice language.
- l mean the chinese.
- Boss, there are movements.
Get ready. Catch everyone.
The Christmas vacation is over.
Giber tells you!
What the hell is that?
What happens here?
They will escape!
Do something!
l commandeer the vehicle.
Follow me!
- We have beautiful view.
- l see. ls it quietly in winter.
Yes, very quietly.
- Commissar! Wait for me!
- There is no time! Stop!
- As l mentioned we are in want offunds.
- Yes. But l see two cops using
one bike. lt's going too far...
You are right.
Tell the chopper pilot, we'll
be in time.
l'll miss you Emilien.
- Because l like you, you are not
going to suffer too much.
- That's very kind ofyou.
You'll have the privilege to
know the exact time ofyour
death, thanks to this device.
lt's from my Swiss relations.
Once started, the device will
set free that ball, which will
smash you at the first wave.
- How much time l have left?
- You have exactly 5 minutes.
- Cool.
- Use well your time to clean out
your soul.
You have to set free your
consciousness before you go...
...to the non-existence.
- Clean up everything for 5 minutes?
lt's not fair.
You should start.
l'll take your mobile as a
souvenir.
l am sentimental.
lt's from my chinese relations.
Go to hell!
Now l need a miracle.
Oh, not the ball...
Oh, not the taxi...
Take me out Daniel. You can't
imagine what happened to me.
lt was terrible. And my mobile...
The bitch took my mobile phone.
We have to find her.
- You don't know what she did!
- l just saved your life.
- Am l wrong?
- No, you are right.
l risked my car to be broken
like a police jaloppy.
- Don't say that. You are a good
driver.
- So say thank you for saving mylife.
lf l don't catch that gang, you
saved my life for nothing.
Giber will kill me because of
my faults.
We'll find that gang, but
first say: ''Thank you''
How do we find it. They are
gone without trace.
- Say: Thank you!
- Thank you. ls it okay
Yes!
l am sorry, l am sorry.
l can't stand any more.
The chinese...
She tortured me for hours.
- She tortured you?
- Yes. lt was terrible.
- What kind oftortures?
- l've never seen something
like that.
l mean, you can't imagine.
lt's hard to explain.
l feel pain, when l talk
about this.
l see.
Don't worry.
We'll find the chines.
Did you see, did you hear something,
when you was captive. - No.
They was talking to some chopper
pilot...
- They wore fur coats.
- Fur coats?
- Do you see something?
- No.
- lt's cold
- Yes. ls this snow?
Yes. And that means two things.
They come from high and it's not
far away from here.
That plus the fur-coats must mean
something.
- Probably.
- What can they do with all that
money in the mountain?
And ifthey want to go over
the mountain. What is there?
Switzerland. Of course!
What a good plan...
They'll travel by car as far as
possible.
There are so many tourists.
Nobody will pay attention
to them.
They will take offfrom some
ski station. There are a lot of
choppers.
They are genius.
Let find the ski station, which
is near the Swiss border.
Val d'lsere.
- Did you see something?
- No. Absolutely nothing.
Sentinel N1 , negative.
- Where you'll spend your vacation?
- l don't know yet.
Following the way of deduction,
the car has to be somewhere here.
- You look from the right side,
l look from the left side.
- Okay.
Do you discriminate between
left and right?
Ah, yes. You mean your right
side.
- Talk clearer!
- What's the difference, we are
side by side.
But l imagined l am facing you.
- What!
- Daniel! The car.
- Here it is.
- Turn right!
- Do you know where do you point to?
- No. All the directions are same for
me. What do you think.
l'll turn right.
Be careful!
- What is this road, Daniel?
- l don't know. Look at the map.
- These cars are a little bit
strange.
- Rental cars ofthe ski station.What's so strange?
What do they say?
- You are 1 minute 10 seconds
late. ls that a problem?
- No, l'll speed up.
Oh no! Look at the ruts!
We cant continue. The pursuit
is over.
The pursuit never stops.
lt's impossible follow them.
Take it easy. Nothing is impossible.
What do you thing about my
collection autumn-winter?
Not bad.
Did you test it?
Never.
- lt seems to be working!
- lt seems.
- How will we find them in the
mountain?
- We can follow the tracks, forexample.
Yes, good idea.
Do you have some device, ifthe
chopper takes off?
You became a little bit insolent,
you know?
l am just trying to keep the
conversation.
- Okay!
- May l use your mobile? The chinese
stole mine.
Put the money into the rucksacks.
We leave before sundown.
Go back to work!
- Do you think they are still there?
- lt's hard to say.
- Hello.
- Emilien! The operation ''Snow-white''
started.
l'll be close to you in 10 minutes.
Your commissar is with me.
- He insisted to participate.
- Oh, no.
- Commissar!
- Yes? -Are you sure it's a
good idea?
Listen to me Alain, l have served
under 13th division of special
forces for 18 months.
The mountain knows me!
- Yes. But it's so high!
- Have you seen the snow before?
l prefer the heat.
Not me!
Let's go!
En route!
- l'll take a look.
- l wouldn't do that.
Just 5 minutes.
Damn it. lt's always the same.
You were right. The road is
out of reach.
Did you see! You could wait for
a minute. Look what you did.
- Take it easy. lt's just water.
- No, for now it's just snow, and
the snow leaves traces.
- Ok, l'll clean your car.
- You'll clean it with what?
l sad, l'll clean it. With what
is my problem.
Come on! Let's go.
- You'll take that risk?
- No. For now, i'll just drive.
Damn it! Follow me!
- Hey! lt's a forest.
- So what? Are you afraid of
forest.
No, l am worried about the car.
- Where are you going?
- Calm down. We are stable.
They call the chopper! Get ready!
- Boss! Are you sure...?
- Shut up Alain, everything's
gonna be alright.
Go boys!
Damn it!
What happened?
Wait for me-e-e!
- lt seems, the cord is short.
- Of course it's short.
- No, you can't do that.
- Just look.
Done!
Wait for me!!
There he is the skier from
Austria...
- Are you sure, that is the road.
- l think so, between the two poles.
The trail offers excellent conditions...
The skier is in perfect shape,
he improved all the times...
...probably he'll be the new
champion...
The win seems to be sure...
What the hell is that?
A taxi?!?
They finished together.
lt's too calm.
- You could give it to me like a souvenir.
- The place you go, the souvenirs are not
allowed.
But you'll have a time for
reflection.
Lead her away!
Tell me, she have tortured you
for hours,
and you are not so angry.
- You know, everything passes over.
- Certainly.
Did you see Giber?
l am coming!
O-oh! l am comi-i-ng!
- Boss! Be careful about the landing.
- Calm down! lt's only snow...
Oh no!
lt must be refreshing...
- Hello!
- Emilien? l'll bear.
- You'll bear? Now?
- Well, that will take some time,
but hurry up!
l am on the way.
Commissar, Petra will have
a baby!
- l feel the party.
- Daniel!
l am here, l am here. Everything
will be fine.
Don't go anywhere.
This is not the time.
Calm down. Everything will be
alright. Right?
Emilien, hold on! Not now.
Look at the monitor. The contractions
will come in a moment.
On which monitor are the contractions?
On this one.
Push! Push!
- What to push?
- Not you! You look at the
monitor!
Contractions!
Push, push, push!
Breathe, breathe!
- Not you! She has to breathe.
- Breathe darling, breath!
Contractions!
Push!
Push! Go! Go!
Now breathe, breathe...
- l see the head.
- Eh. The head?
- Contractions!
- One more time!
One more time darling, push!
Ok, relax.
Relax, relax, relax...
A very nice boy.
l became father...
Would you cut the navel?
l suppose, he'll do it later,
ifyou don't mind.
- What are you doing here?
- l am training.
- Why? Are you pregnant?
- No, but the woman l love is
pregnant.
l need some time to get used.
Where did you find that foolish?
l had the best of luck.
- l would promise her something.
- Like what?
Spend more time with her,
than with my car, be the best
father...
- And the fridge?
- The fridge will be empty.
l'll be the best husband, if
she marries me.
- Does she believe you?
- Not at all.
But this is the first time, when
l am talking seriously,
and l am absolutely sincere.
Your sincerity touched me
more, than the nice words.
Lily, would you marry me?
lt's very easy, because l am
pregnant, and you thing l have
no choice.
- Lily.
- ln any case this is not the way.
To have a good family, you
have to do your best.
Lily, would you give me the
honour to marry me?
- That depends.
- Depends on what?
How good lover you are.
You know, l won't disappoint you!
l have to check this!
Emilien, Emilien.
