I want to tell you about the time
I almost died.
I never thought it would happen to me.
Not at this age.
Beaten...
...outsmarted.
How did I get into this fix?
How did it all begin?
If I go back to the beginning
that'll take forever.
So, let's start more recently.
Somewhere.
Anywhere.
Reese.
I thought the governor
didn't approve of this.
The more they don't approve,
the more they want to watch.
So what is this, six notches on your beIt?
Eight.
CongratuIations.
Fuck you.
Ask me more niceIy, huh?
John Hobbes.
You're wanted in the dance haII.
Edgar Reese.
WeII, weII, weII.
Look who's here.
It's the briIIiant detective
who seaIed my brutish fate.
That's right.
So, what's this?
They're making you famous now?
Big time. They're gonna put me
in the movies. Documentary.
AII courtesy of the ACLU.
They'II shoot me getting smoked.
Who knows?
Maybe it'II be a big video rentaI.
AII these society Iadies showing it
to their dinner guests:
"You see that there?
That's a urine stain, Iadies."
"Oh, my, it's not urine."
It's good to see you, Hobbes.
It's good to be seen by you, Reese.
You're...
...my best paI.
You're stiII a good feIIa.
Open the gate.
You remind me of somebody, Hobbes.
Indeed you do.
Indeed you do.
Do you Iike riddIes?
No, I don't.
Here's a beaut.
Why is there...
...a space between Lyons and Spakowsky?
What?
Come on. You shouId know this one, paI.
You shouId know this one.
Open your eyes. Look around sometime.
Open the gate.
Remember this, Hobbes.
A day...
...a week, a month.
What are you, a Nazi now?
It's Dutch.
What goes around...
...reaIIy goes around.
You have a safe trip.
I'II be Iooking for you.
What goes around reaIIy goes around.
Howdy, foIks.
Ladies, gents...
...cocksuckers, pederasts...
...I hope you aII enjoy the show. Yes, I do.
I'II give you a bIowjob
if you get me out of this baby.
"Time
"Is on my side
"Yes, it is
"Time
"Is on my side
"Yes, it is
"Now, you aIways say
"That you want to be free
"But I'II come running back
"I'II come running back to you"
Baby, come on, go ahead...
...Iight up my Iife!
Something is always happening.
But when it happens,
people don't always see it...
...or understand it...
...or accept it.
The criminals don't accept consequences.
They kill. It's not their fault.
This is the consequence of what I do.
-Look who made it. How'd it go?
-Mr. Consequence.
-He died.
-I toId you.
Get one more.
Nice to see you.
How you doing, Gracie?
-Don't tempt me with that.
-Sorry.
What's your poison? We got some Becks.
We got some Guinness.
We got some Bass.
-Budweiser's good for me.
-Budweiser?
-Yeah.
-Good.
No, we're going imported here.
-If you can't afford it, I'II buy.
-I can afford it. Budweiser.
At Ieast have a Bud Ice
or a Bud Dry or something.
It is just a Bud, okay?
-You guys want anything?
-No.
Here's your Bud.
He was one of the most notorious inmates.
Here you go.
Thank you, sweetheart.
You're an unusuaI cop, Hobbes.
ReaIIy?
I've been in this precinct about what,
five, six months?
Everybody says,
"Hobbes don't take no cream."
"Hobbes don't take no cream."
Now is that true, or what?
No, I don't Iike cream.
That means "no"?
Yeah, it means "no."
Now, is that "no" as in "never,"
"no" as in "sometimes"...
...or "no" as in "I do,
but I don't Iike to taIk about it"?
"No" as in "never."
This is a big city, Hobbesy.
We got a tradition to uphoId.
Got something wrong with your ears?
When the man says something, he says it.
This is hypotheticaI:
A cop who's trying to make ends meet
wants a IittIe something on the side....
I don't Iike cream...
...and I don't judge.
You don't judge?
He's a fucking saint, huh?
So you're teIIing me
that under no circumstances...
...wouId a hoIy man Iike you ever,
you know...
...break the Iaw or do something....
Look, Lou...
...I couId jump across the tabIe,
snatch your heart out of your chest...
...squeeze the bIood out,
and stick it in your front pocket.
Oh, yeah?
If I Iost controI. But if I did...
...I'd be no different
than the peopIe we bust.
Now, as to your generaI question....
You take any cop on the force,
cream or no...
...ninety-nine percent of the time
they're doing their job, aren't they?
Ninety-nine five.
Point five.
So he or she, cream or no...
...is doing more good out there every day...
...than any Iawyer or a stockbroker or...
...President of the United States
can ever do in their Iifetime.
Cops are the "chosen peopIe."
Amen.
Guess I'm switching to Bud.
Gracie, come here and get this foreign shit
off my tabIe...
...and bring me three Buds.
Damn it, what took you so Iong?
You know what you'd Iook Iike
with this sandwich up your ass?
Pardon me?
Like a fat, stupid fuck
with a sandwich up his ass.
CharIes, I hate to do this, but....
Put the job where the sandwich goes.
HeIIo?
HeIIo?
HeIIo?
Here we go. Juice, pretzeIs...
...appIe....
Peanut butter and jeIIy sandwich.
UncIe John, wiII you pIease
make my Iunch tomorrow?
Here's Toby.
I can't be having the same thing every day.
What do you want,
peanut butter and jeIIy sandwich?
JeIIy and peanut butter?
I Iove you, Dad.
Don't forget your UncIe Johnny.
I can feeI the Iove in this room, man.
-Bye.
-Be good.
-Have a good day at schooI.
-Okay. Bye.
You're doing a good job, Art.
-Yeah?
-Yeah.
Why don't you sit down with me?
Let's taIk a bit.
You're not in a hurry?
No, no....
I can reIax today.
Besides, what are they going to do?
Fire me?
-How're you doing?
-Okay.
-You're aII right?
-Yeah.
I Iove you, Johnny.
You ever think it wouId be easier,
your Iife wouId be easier...
...if maybe me and Sam
were not Iiving with--
No, no.
-Maybe Marcy wouIdn't have Ieft.
-Later for Marcy.
If she Ioved me, she wouId've never Ieft.
Besides, famiIy's aIways first.
You're my brother.
I Iove you, too.
But don't make the boy any more
peanut butter and jeIIy sandwiches.
-No more peanut butter and jeIIy.
-Okay.
A cop knows.
A cop sees.
Even the most casual thing, it registers.
Often you don't remember till later on.
But then...
...you look back and you realize...
...you knew.
Good morning, Detective.
How're you doing, Lieutenant?
Look who's feeIing good today.
Hey, what can I say?
You're Iooking better than me.
Got a caII on four, Hobbes.
Thank you, Denise. Jonesy?
How's everything today? Good?
Detective Hobbes.
Pal, you got a pen?
...South Stender, Apartment 2.
Who's there?
A clue, Magoo.
CouIdn't sIeep Iast night.
Who can?
Remember I used to get caIIs at two or
three o'cIock in the morning from Reese?
He Ioved you. He truIy did.
Somebody caIIed me Iast night.
Imagine that.
-Denise?
-Yeah?
Send a car to 4541 South Stender,
Apartment 2.
Make sure we gain entry.
Got a body?
No, it's probabIy just some knuckIehead,
saw me on TV, trying to impress his girI.
-How'd I Iook Iast night?
-FabuIous.
You saw that? Four different channeIs.
You're a god. You're a god.
Name's Muskavich. Russian expatriate.
Super says no famiIy,
no friends, no nothing.
Why is he dead, then?
What've you got?
I've got puncture wounds.
Look for a syringe, or something.
Eighteen.
-What's that, his eighteenth victim?
-CouId be.
CouId be.
Very tidy.
The DOA's been dead awhiIe,
so what the heII is this?
KiIIer sIept over and then...
...had a nice, neat breakfast.
Looks Iike it.
Check this out.
Shit.
What?
It's a riddIe.
Reese, in his ceII before he died,
he asked me, "Why is there a space...
"...between Lyons and Spakowsky?"
Yeah?
AccompIice?
Reese had an accompIice?
UnIess it's a copycat. Maybe the...
...prison guards or the peopIe
that made that documentary.
-You got a minute?
-I'II be there in a second.
Fifty peopIe must have seen
that documentary by now.
Me and Jonesy wiII run them down.
Yeah, good.
Fingerprint. Perp wore no gIoves.
Left prints on the spoon and cereaI bowI
Iike he was advertising.
Maybe his prints aren't in the system.
I hate to be stupid...
Enjoy it, Lou.
...but is motive stiII something
we think about...
...or is it that aII these crimes
are done out of sickness?
Number 2.
Everything is motive.
Sickness is motive.
Sharp.
The coroner's preIim on the Ruski.
Isn't that the wacko poison
that Reese used on them Arab kids?
-Tiff?
-Yeah?
You Iike riddIes? You know,
puzzIes and shit? Brainteasers?
Sure, as Iong as I'm doing the teasing.
Why is there a space
between Lyons and Spakowsky?
What does that even mean? Come on!
We had a Spakowsky in my rookie year.
South Precinct.
Come again?
Not your Spakowsky. This guy's a cop.
Keep taIking.
The guy's a fucking asshoIe.
He's the King Kong of asshoIes.
He's a fucking Iegend.
His name's up on the waII.
What?
Some chief in the '30s
thought it wouId boost moraIe.
They kept it up untiI '81 or '82,
and it got to be Iike a booby prize.
It was downtown in the Iobby...
tiII they remodeIed.
Must've passed it by 1,000 times.
I guess I need to open my eyes
and Iook around sometime.
Lyons, I don't remember him,
but Spakowsky, he was around.
This guy was so fucking mean
that his wife shot him in the foot.
Who was '65?
Who was in that space?
You got me, bud. I don't know.
You're saying they took a name off?
Why wouId they do that?
I don't know. I caIIed Records.
They say they don't know who it was...
...and they don't know why it's not there.
We'd better find out.
Lieutenant, just the man I wanted to see.
"Robert MiIano."
That's right.
Cop of the Year, 1965.
Eight months Iater, goes up to a cabin,
middIe of nowhere, dies cIeaning his gun.
So it's either two things:
He was dirty or it was a woman.
What?
I met him once...MiIano.
He had a poker up his ass,
but otherwise he was a good cop.
-What I want to know is--
-I know what you want.
I can't heIp you.
Can't heIp me?
Look...
...do aII of us a favor, okay?
Whatever you find out...
...keep it to yourseIf.
I got something for you.
Documentary on Reese.
Thank you. You're a reaI white man.
Jonesy.
-Tape on Reese. You want to view it?
-Give me a sec.
What do you got on Muskavich?
Fingerprints were bust.
The crime scene says
the kiIIer probabIy had dark hair.
He probabIy was Ieft-handed.
Yeah, Iike Reese.
He had bad teeth.
Found a piece in the corn fIakes.
Directory Assistance.
Can you give me a number on a MiIano...
...SyIvia M-I-L-A-N-O.
Hold, please.
Hey, Lieutenant.
Excuse me, Boss.
If somebody dies because you kept
your mouth shut, you're hoIding the bag.
When it's a perfect worId, Iet me know.
In the meantime,
it's not me keeping his mouth shut.
-Is that cIear enough for you?
-Yeah.
I'm sorry. There's no listing.
Okay, thanks. No, Iisten, Iisten.
You stiII there? HeIIo?
Check and see if there's a G. MiIano,
a Gretta MiIano. Can you do that for me?
-Hold, please.
-Thanks.
Syringe had the same prints.
-So now what? Video time?
-Yeah.
You know, I was thinking....
Don't hurt yourseIf.
Eat me.
Hold for the number.
Whoever did Muskavich,
knew the poison that Reese used.
He quotes Reese. He couId be a cop.
He couId be, huh?
Lou, couId be a cop, huh?
Please leave a message. Thank you.
Make sure Hobbes gets a copy of this.
Are you watching, Johnny-boy?
I hope you're paying close attention.
Every gesture!
Every word!
Wait a second.
What?
Check something out.
That...
...Ianguage he was speaking...
...Iater.
That's Dutch?
That's what he said.
What's he speaking now? Is that Dutch?
This now?
This is mumbo-jumbo, gibberish.
You sure on that?
Who is it?
It's Detective John Hobbes.
I'm looking for Miss Gretta Milano.
-Oh, yes. You left a message.
-Yes.
I wanted to taIk to you about your father.
How're you doing?
May I come in?
Sure.
You're surrounded by angeIs.
I teach theoIogy at the university.
I see. Very beautifuI.
Thank you.
Why do you want to know
about my father?
It's 30 years Iater and the fiIes are seaIed...
...and my boss was toId to Iet it aIone, so...
...here I am.
I can teII you what my mother toId me
before she died.
Why do you want to know?
Just curious, or...?
No, ma'am.
See, I'm the detective
who caught Edgar Reese.
I'm not sure if you're famiIiar with him.
He was just executed.
-Yeah, I read about him.
-Right.
And this Reese feIIa, he...
...in a roundabout way,
gave me your father's name.
Did Reese Iike to sing?
Yeah, he did, actuaIIy.
And at the execution,
did he try and touch you or grab you?
Yeah, he did. He shook my hand.
Do you want some coffee?
Sure.
One condition:
You and I never spoke.
You say nothing to your boss or partner.
Nothing goes in the fiIes.
My name and everything I say
is just between us. Agreed?
WiII I get a cup of coffee if I say yes?
Detective, my dad was a good cop.
"Pride of the force" and aII that.
And then he shot himseIf.
A reporter found out
my father had been under investigation.
He'd caught a kiIIer,
but copycat crimes started.
Evidence mounted up against him:
fingerprints, witnesses.
The press never got reaI proof,
but my father's medaI was rescinded.
I see.
So you're saying that when he died
someone made this evidence go away?
The mayor, the governor and
the chief of poIice, they aII needed a hero.
Some of these peopIe are
stiII important today.
-I see.
-No. Not yet, you don't.
My father saw the evidence against him,
toId my mother he couIdn't beat it.
So, he went to this cabin in the mountains.
It's a pIace that's been
in my mother's famiIy for generations.
He went there and....
The thing is...
...I know my father was innocent
of those murders.
How do you know?
How do you know he was innocent?
It was 30 years ago.
It's not important anymore.
It's important to me, Miss MiIano.
Don't you want the truth to come out,
the kiIIer to be punished?
-Of course, I do.
-But?
Are you afraid that if you teII me
your Iife may be in danger?
Yeah.
That's it?
Yes.
Okay.
Okay.
Thank you very much.
-For the coffee as weII.
-Okay.
Oh, Iisten....
If I have any more questions,
can I caII you?
I'd rather you didn't.
Detective....
Do you beIieve in God?
Yeah. I go to church every now and then.
What I see in my Iine of work...
...faith's a IittIe hard to sustain.
Good Iuck.
Sometimes I think the basicjob
that human beings have...
...isjust to figure out
what the hell is going on.
Example: Gretta Milano.
What was she hiding?
What was she so scared of?.
And then her question about God.
What the hell is that all about?
You never know.
Down to the smallest thing.
The man who passes you
and catches your eye. Does he know you?
Did you go to school together? Is he a
homicidal maniac who hates you on sight?
Or is it nothing?
Nothing at all.
Wake up.
Go to bed.
I know. I know.
Here we go. Up. Up.
I'm going, UncIe John.
HeIIo?
HeIIo?
Let's go, Sam.
Good night.
Good night, son.
-Johnny?
-Yeah?
Do you ever get scared?
Yeah, sometimes.
Me, too.
Good night, Art.
-Hello?
-Mrs. Moohr? This is CharIes.
ApparentIy, I must have gotten drunk
or something...
...because the Iast few days....
Am I working tonight?
You quit.
I quit?
Yes. You insulted Harry
and he hired someone else.
But.... I mean.... How...?
Look, I'm reaIIy sorry....
CouId you apoIogize, pIease,
to your husband for whatever--
We always liked you, Charles. Goodbye.
HeIIo?
Well, well, well. Look who's here.
I pIayed Reese's tape on the phone
to a Iinguist. He's coming down.
Yeah? PreIim?
Said it sounded Mideastern.
-Anything on Muskavich?
-OnIy the pizza.
Now, we're hitting
your area of expertise, huh?
Pizza is a staff of Iife.
Without pizza and other fine ItaIian foods,
there wouId be no happiness.
There was one sIice Ieft:
GarIic, Iinguica and pineappIe.
PIus, there was nothing
in Muskavich's stomach.
So it was the kiIIer's eats.
HeII of a cIue. You better write
that one up for the journaI.
I wiII, Lou. And I wiII Iaud you copiousIy.
Thank you.
Detectives? Your guy's in Video.
The Iinguist guy's here.
I'II be right there.
Any Iuck?
John Hobbes, Professor Richard Louders.
-How do you do?
-PIeasure.
This is compIeteIy exhiIarating.
Who is this convict? Can I speak to him?
Not now. Have a seat.
Professor says it's a Ianguage.
He's just never heard it spoken aIoud.
-Meaning?
-Some kind of antique.
I beIieve this is a BibIicaI tongue:
Syrian Aramaic.
OnIy a few nomadic tribes stiII use it.
So you don't know what he's saying?
I haven't the faintest.
He's not too pIeasant, is he?
But if you'd spare me a copy,
I'd be more than happy to work it.
I'd appreciate it. If you couId wait out front
for 15 minutes...
...we'II dupe one off for you.
I'II be waiting.
-See you in a minute.
-'Bye, Detective.
-Syrian Aramaic.
-Imagine that.
I got something eIse, too.
I'm Iooking up this cIipping...
...of Reese, high-schooI basebaII team.
He bats right.
He throws right.
What are you saying, Hobbes?
Reese puIIed off some of the sickest shit
on record.
He speaks a Ianguage 2,000 years oId and
you're worried 'cause he's ambidextrous?
I'm worried about everything.
-Hobbes, caII on Line 1 .
-Thank you, BiII.
Detective Hobbes.
Hey, pal, need another clue?
...Apartment 9.
Jonesy, that pizza pIace
with the number 17?
Is that cIose to Grove?
I think so.
They're in the same pIace...
...exactIy.
-It's Iike he's Iaughing at us.
-He is.
Cash, not a check?
That's right.
Take a Iook at this.
What the heII is this?
You know what's scary?
I'm going home Iast night, this guy's
waIking past me, he's going the other way.
He Iooks me right in the eye.
The kind of Iook Iike he knows you.
You know what I mean?
It's the same guy that's in the bathtub.
-The stiff.
-You're shitting me.
I shit you not. Same guy.
Oh, man.
I ain't smart enough to figure this out.
Me, neither.
Found under the sink.
Same poison?
Same poison.
Better get that down to the Iab.
-What eIse have you got?
-The number on his chest.
Last Thursday it's 18, now it's 2?
Everything's under a CharIes OIom,
but it Iooks Iike that's an aIias.
So, we're running his prints.
To quote Yogi Berra ,
"It's Iike dájá vu aII over again."
-You mean Reese?
-Yeah.
Whoever is doing it...
...has a thing for Hobbes.
Seems like.
How is he?
Who, Hobbes?
How is he ever? He's fine. He's great.
If it starts to work at him,
let me know, okay?
And if it starts to work on me,
I'II Iet you know.
I thought that was you.
What are you doing, more...
...historicaI research?
Nice taIking to you. See you Monday.
AII right, Lou.
Come on, Jimmy.
Over here, shoot it!
Shoot it, shoot it!
Come on, come on, Sam. Okay.
That's okay, that's okay.
Score is tied.
No, 19 to 17.
You can take him.
Pass the baII. I'm open.
Take the baII back.
Johnny's going to make a point.
He's got the baII.
-Hi, Art.
-How're you doing?
Good one! Three, two, one!
That's it for me. I've gotta go.
No, I've gotta go. I have a Iong drive.
Art, get in here.
UncIe John, but he's a spaz.
You don't disrespect your father, okay?
You understand me?
Cherish what you got.
Get on in there.
-Want to come with us?
-I didn't bring my shoes.
Come on.
What's up?
-Tiffany didn't get you?
-No, what's up?
You know how weird this case is?
We got a positive I.D...
...on CharIes OIom.
ReaI name's Mickey Noons.
Born in Canada, iIIegaI aIien.
BIah, bIah, bIah. SmaIItime shithead.
That ain't bad.
That ain't it.
Noons kiIIed the Ruski. It's his prints
aII over Muskavich's apartment.
What?
Let's see, Noons poisons Muskavich...
...dumps him in the tub,
sets out the corn fIakes.
Three days Iater somebody does
the exact same thing to him.
"Exact," because Noons and Muskavich
were kiIIed by the same person.
Some kind of ringmaster?
I think so.
Hey, Art. You and Sam don't forget Iunch,
aII right?
I don't know.
I can't seem to get my mind around it.
I got a bad feeIing about this.
Me, too.
Somebody's pIaying with my dick
and it ain't me.
-Yeah. See you.
-'Bye.
-Ten minutes, Art!
-Okay.
There are moments which mark your life.
Moments when you realize
nothing will ever be the same.
And time is divided into two parts:
Before this...
...and after this.
Sometimes you can feel
such a moment coming.
That's the test...or so I tell myself.
I tell myself that at times like that...
...strong people keep moving forward,
anyway...
...no matter what they're going to find.
-Miss MiIano.
-Oh, heIIo.
I went to your famiIy's pIace
in the mountains.
-BeautifuI, isn't it?
-Yes, it is.
Let me get that for you.
Trees and the water....
AbsoIuteIy beautifuI.
What does "AzazeI" mean?
Your father wrote it in the basement
on the waII, then he painted over it.
My dictionary...
...says that it's "the...
"...eviI spirit of the wiIderness."
Whatever that means.
One of the books your father had up there
taIks about demons...
...and how they move by touch.
WaIk away, Mr. Hobbes.
-Say again?
-If you enjoy your Iife...
...if there's even one human being
you care about, don't take this case.
It's out of my hands, Miss MiIano.
I mean, it's my job.
'Bye, Mr. Hobbes.
That's it?
Yeah, I'm afraid so.
-Fax.
-Thanks.
Phone company sent MUDs and LUDs
for Noons' and Muskavich's apartments.
See those caIIs there?
They were made right around
the time they were kiIIed.
You're saying the kiIIer caIIed me
from the crime scene?
Sure Iooks Iike it.
-Reese used to caII me at night.
-Reese is dead.
Whoever's doing this
is in Ieague with Reese...
...or was imitating Reese.
I know he's stiII caIIing my house.
How many times have I got to change
my phone number?
The more you change it, the more it Iooks
Iike someone on the inside.
Like a cop?
Yeah.
It's nothing to me...
...but the egos upstairs....
-You hear me?
-Both ears.
I'm going to Iose my sense of humor.
What've you got?
A transIation from the Aramaic:
"I can't enter you by touch.
"But even when I can get inside you,
after I'm spirit, I won't.
"I'II fuck you up and down, Ieft and right."
That's in the BibIe.
"If that doesn't work, I have other ways."
We need a transIation of the transIation.
Anything eIse?
No, I'm okay. Thanks.
I like the night.
The street.
The smells.
The sense of another world.
Sometimes you come
face to face with yourself.
Now...
...put that card back in.
-Anywhere.
-AII right.
-TeII me when to stop, okay?
-Okay.
Can you pronounce it for me again?
Okay, Professor, I think I got it.
AII right...'bye.
I can get inside you.
After I'm spirit, I won't.
No.
Better I get you for real.
Fuck you...
...up, down, left, right, coming, going....
I'll get so close to you...
...so close it breaks you.
And if that doesn't work...
...well, I have other ways.
I have so many...
...many ways.
Right.
Fifteen minutes.
Hi. Can I heIp you?
You're reIeasing a Richard SuckIe?
-He caIIed a cab.
-I'II have him brought right down.
-Looking good today.
-Thanks.
Rap sheet on Bobby Stiggers.
Thank you.
Hobbesy, teII me something.
Shoot.
The other day you were
in the basement reading an oId fiIe.
What about it?
Looked Iike a map in there.
Are you going somewhere?
I went up to the country.
It's great to get out of town.
LoveIy. Fresh air, you know?
I used to do that. Go up to a house
in the mountains and sit by the water.
It was beautifuI.
So I'm curious. Where'd you go?
Why do you ask?
Come here.
Come here.
Come on, come here.
"Time
"Is on my side
"Yes, it is
"Time
"Is on my side
"Yes, it is"
-Lou?
-What?
"You're aIways saying
"That you want to be free
"But I'II come running back"
Why were you singing that song?
-Song?
-Why were you singing that song?
I was singing?
Did they put you up to this?
Why did you sing that song?
What're you taIking about?
-You don't know what I'm taIking about?
-No, I don't.
You don't know what I'm taIking about?
Hey, you!
Syrian Aramaic.
How cIever.
Jesus.
It's true what I said.
I do know who you are.
AzazeI.
Where'd you get that?
From MiIano's pIace?
You found something up there.
WeII, some things, paI, you shouIdn't know.
Like what?
Like what?
If you know, you shouId never, ever teII.
Beware of my wrath.
WeII?
What were you doing back then?
-What are you taIking about?
-You were singing.
No.
-I wasn't singing.
-You were.
Lawrence and Mike were singing
some '60s thing.
There you go.
I wasn't singing it. I hated the fucking '60s.
I wasn't singing.
I appreciate your situation, okay?
I really do.
Your father, mother, they're dead,
their Iives were ruined, your Iife's ruined.
I'm very sorry about that.
But I gotta know what's going on.
If this thing is what it seems to be...
...if this thing is what the book says
that it is, then....
Is this for reaI? Do you beIieve this stuff?
I beIieve more is hidden than is seen.
I beIieve what I see. I'm trying to get
my mind around what I just saw.
Something...
...threatened me.
Reese threatened me in Aramaic.
What eIse did Reese say?
I'm asking the questions here.
You answer the questions I ask.
Because if I don't know what's going on--
We're not supposed to know.
We're not supposed to see.
It's Iike the Mafia. They don't even exist.
Okay...okay.
That's good. That's a start.
They don't even exist.
So where are they from?
Who the heII are they?
There are certain phenomena...
...which can onIy be expIained
if there is a god...
...and if there are angeIs.
And there are. They exist.
Some angeIs were cast down. A few
were punished by being deprived of form.
They can onIy survive in the bodies
of others. It's inside of us.
Inside of human beings,
their vengeance is pIayed out.
That's it?
Come on, get out of here.
Come on.
I mean....
Miss MiIano, I'm just a cop, okay?
I'm a detective.
My work is based upon evidence, facts.
Mine, too. Mine, too.
Aren't your facts here
rather resistant to normaI interpretation?
So you're saying that...
...Edgar Reese is actuaIIy--
At the time you knew him,
he was not himseIf.
-He was AzazeI?
-Yes, AzazeI.
Sadistic, Ieft-handed, Iikes to sing.
Reese? Why does he focus in on me?
You got his attention.
He tried to get inside you.
He shook your hand. That didn't work,
so now he'II try to find some other way.
Like he did with your father?
How do we fight him? Is it possibIe?
I beIieve it is. And I'm not aIone.
There's a network. I don't even know
who they are. I just have numbers.
These peopIe know the--
We beIieve that God Iimited demons
and made them mortaI.
He put a few of us here to fight them.
Us? Us who?
Who, us?
You're saying I'm one of these peopIe?
I don't know. Maybe. Maybe not.
You're just doing your job.
Okay.
Touché.
So these demons are mortaI?
They can be kiIIed?
-By the right person.
-Who is?
This is reIigion, Mr. Hobbes.
These are matters of fate and divine order.
The right man--
-Or woman.
-Yes.
It couId be you, me, anybody?
The right person of the right character
with the right knowIedge....
So, this is what you've been doing.
You've been preparing for this,
haven't you?
Can I ask you something personaI?
Everything's personaI if you're a person.
Is this why you Iive aIone?
There's a difference between
risking for yourseIf and someone eIse.
That's true.
I mean...
...if I had someone, I'd want to share
my Iife and thoughts, and work with them.
If I shared this, I'd put them at risk
and I don't have that right.
You can taIk to me.
You don't have to. I'm not saying that....
I'm not, you know....
Do whatever you want to do. I'm just
saying you can taIk to me if you want.
Thanks.
That's a very nice thing to say.
I've got to go.
I hope I've been heIpfuI.
-Thanks for Iistening.
-Thank you.
I'm sorry.
I was about to tap you on the shouIder.
You're a friend of John Hobbes, right?
I'm Jay ReynoIds.
You know?
How IoveIy.
You're not just Hobbes' chippy.
Have we met?
You seem vagueIy famiIiar.
Come on...
...teII me.
I'm about to find out anyway.
ForepIay.
Watch out.
No, you don't!
PIease, heIp me!
Go! Go!
-Open up!
-Go!
Jesus, are you aII right?
Are you aII right?
Thanks for coming.
I ran.
He came after me and I ran.
Maybe you weren't ready yet.
That's the point. You have to be ready.
You know what it is?
I never beIieved this day wouId come.
I thought God wouId make it up to me.
I'd be good...
...and God wouId show me
an angeI instead.
Do they know who you are?
We shouIdn't be seen together.
Not anymore.
Wipe your tears.
You wanted to see me, Lieutenant?
How're you doing?
Fine.
Murders not getting you wound up?
Bag the chocoIates. You ain't got
to taIk to me sideways. What's up?
Where were you
when Muskavich and Noons were kiIIed?
Where was I?
Am I a suspect?
Sit down.
Not to me, you're not.
But....
Lieutenant, you know....
What is it, the phone records again?
What do they think I did?
I committed murder, then caIIed home,
then ran home and answered my phone?
No, it's something eIse.
Your prints.
My prints?
On what?
On that fucking IittIe coin of yours.
-Where?
-Noons' pIace.
Shit.
This is a frame-up.
Is it?
Anybody couId have got those coins.
They couId've got them
when I was at the store or something.
They couId've taken them off my desk.
We aIways said it couId be a cop.
We did aIways say that.
I'm not stupid, you know.
I know you know more than you're saying.
So teII me.
You don't reaIIy want to know.
You'd have to be there.
I was there and I don't even want to know.
Try me.
You remember Robert MiIano?
Listen to me.
This is exactIy what happened to him.
He was framed.
I'II give you some advice.
Let go of it for a coupIe of hours.
Go home.
See your famiIy.
Take a Ioad off.
The hell with Stanton.
The hell with all of them.
Nobody likes to get
the shit kicked out of them.
Nobody likes to get hit from every angle.
But eviljust keeps on coming.
You know what I mean?
You saw it before, but now...
...it's in your face, laughing at you.
-Hi, Unc.
-Hey, Sam.
How're you doing?
Hi, Mr. Hobbes.
You're home earIy today.
For a change.
-Did you move my address book?
-What?
No.
What?
What's wrong with your eye?
Who hit you in the eye?
I feII.
You feII?
I feII, or something.
PeopIe don't faII down and get a bIack eye.
-No?
-No.
AII right, it's okay.
It's okay. Look....
What happened?
Sammy hit me.
What?
It was an accident though.
He didn't mean to.
He didn't mean to.
It was an accident. It was an accident!
John...John!
Sam?
Where's Toby?
Outside, I guess.
Okay, go back in the house.
-Toby?
-Hey, Hobbes.
Leave my famiIy aIone, you hear me?
Go back in the house.
-What's going on?
-Go back in the house!
-You Ieave my famiIy aIone.
-Why?
You came after me.
Now I'm coming after you and yours.
Toby, you aII right?
Go right home. Go.
-Okay, I wiII.
-Run!
What's the matter, paI?
Are you afraid to fight me?
Come on, Hobbes. Come on out.
Come on, Hobbes.
Put the gun down.
I knew you'd come out.
Put the gun on the ground!
I know you, Hobbes.
Set the gun down, sir!
Put the gun down!
"Yes, it is
"Time
"Is on my side"
Hey, paI.
Wake up, Hobbes.
I'm not that easy to kiII.
When my host dies and I move as spirit,
no man can resist me.
What are you going to do, arrest me?
What'II you teII Stanton?
I'd Iove to hear that one.
It's me you want, isn't it?
Why don't you just kiII me?
But I'm stiII having fun.
Aren't you stiII having fun?
He was standing in the street,
yeIIing at him...
...shooting at him.
FinaIIy, when the officer....
I guess that's it.
There's no question
that the dead man shot first?
No question at aII. My wife saw it too,
if you want to ask her.
A schooIteacher.
What am I going to say?
What am I going to do?
We know that he fired first.
Witnesses corroborate.
But his gun was fiIIed with bIanks.
He got the gun out of a stoIen car.
-It was a setup.
-A setup?
That's right. A setup.
He set it up for you to kiII him?
Committing suicide by--
Excuse me.
What the heII are you doing out here?
You take Sam home, Iock every door,
every window....
You don't Iet anybody in. Can you do that?
Can you remember that? AII right, do it.
-Johnny?
-Yeah?
Are you mad at me or something?
No, Art. Never. Just....
Do what I toId you.
Hate to see the mighty faII,
you know what I mean?
Now it's Ietters. Fuck you, Lou.
I toId you, it's a cuIt.
Some weird, psycho,
Aramaic-Satanist reincarnation cuIt.
He's got A-P-O written on his chest.
Trying to send some kind of message.
The kiIIer's sending a message?
Hobbes....
This time, you are the kiIIer.
Yeah, sort of.
No fucking "sort of."
No breaks. No benefit of the doubt.
We're going back to the precinct. Now.
Tonight, another shocking murder
in the city.
A well-respected schoolteacher
opened fire on an off-duty police officer.
The officer...
...John Hobbes, was forced to return fire.
Our report now, from the scene.
We're on the scene
of a most unusual homicide tonight.
CIose the door.
Detective Hobbes shot and killed
a high-school math teacher.
The police have not yet identified him.
According to witnesses,
the man started shouting at Hobbes...
...who was off duty at the time.
I taIked to the schooIteacher's wife.
He got married four months ago.
She's pregnant. He just got a raise.
So much for suicide by a cop!
The shooting team wiII need your gun.
I'II get the hearing as soon as I can.
PeopIe want the worId to make sense.
If the onIy way I can get the worId
to make sense for me is to arrest you...
...then I'II have to do it.
Get the fuck out of here.
-It was a cIean shoot.
-Yeah, I know.
It doesn't heIp, but I know.
Coffee?
No, thanks.
Want to taIk? From where I sit, we're
deaIing with shit that ain't in the manuaI.
Where do they buy coffee with dirt in it?
Can you teII me that?
What's the point of Iife?
-"The point"?
-Yeah.
-"Of Iife"?
-Yeah.
The point of Iife.... You want a cigarette?
No, thanks.
The point of Iife is we catch bad guys.
That's what I used to think.
It's not good enough.
You can shoot me for taIking Iike this, but--
It's two o'cIock in the morning.
You can taIk any way you want.
What are we doing here?
You know what I'm saying?
Why do we even exist?
Us.
Maybe it's God, Hobbes.
Yeah, it couId be.
I have a hard time beIieving that we're...
...part of some huge...
...moraI experiment, you know,
conducted by a greater being than us.
If there's a greater being than we are,
why does he give a shit about us?
There are five biIIion of us.
We're Iike ants. Do we care...
...what ants do, from a moraI standpoint?
"Ants"? No.
I'm foIIowing you,
but at the same time I'm Iosing you.
Are you heading somepIace here?
That's my point.
Are we headed somepIace?
If we don't figure it out....
Maybe if you figure it out...
...you die.
Heart attack, stroke.
You figure out what's what...
...you don't get to hang around anymore.
You get promoted.
MeanwhiIe, DeIores...
...says we're put here to do one thing.
One thing?
What's that?
It's different. It's different for everybody.
Hers is Iasagna.
Lasagna?
And just one thing, not two or...?
Maybe two, I don't know.
It's just her opinion.
But it's Iike...
...when a moment comes...
...we either do the right thing...
...or wrong.
When do you know
when your moment comes?
So, Iike this couId be it for me?
That's the beauty. You never know.
-HeIIo?
-John?
Is that you?
Hi. I just wanted to see if you were okay.
I'II caII you back. I'II caII you Iater.
That was the kiIIer.
We'II arrange things Iater.
I'm going home.
Yeah, fuck it.
I killed someone.
He got me to kill an innocent man.
I know.
What do they want, Gretta?
Just tell me what they want.
The demons?
They want the fall of civilization.
"The fall of Babylon, " as they put it.
-The whole thing?
-Yeah.
They're doing a goodjob, aren't they?
You know, after I shot the teacher...
...Azazel moved to someone else.
Are you sure? After death?
I'm positive. After death. Yeah, I saw it.
Listen to this.
I was looking through
one ofyour father's books...
...and it says "outside"...
I guess that means outside the body.
"Outside, they can survive
for one breath only. "
A Hebrew text says that the breath
can carry them for 500 cubits.
I never knew what it meant.
A cubit, that's a distance
or something, right?
From your elbow to your fingertips.
So 500 cubits would be what?
About a sixth of a mile?
Yeah, well, you're right then.
They are Iimited in certain ways.
What are you thinking?
I don't know.
I don't know. Are you okay?
Yeah.
All right. Well, then...
...maybe I'II check up on you tomorrow.
Good night.
Good night.
Good morning, Sam.
Good morning, Sam.
Oh, hi, UncIe John.
Oh, hi.
-Thanks for tucking me in Iast night.
-You're weIcome.
We sent Michael Aaron to the scene...
...where he'll be ready with a live report
shortly. We'll be right back.
Were you asIeep when I tucked you in?
I don't know. AII I remember
was somebody tickIing me.
TickIing my chest.
Why'd you write that?
-Where's your father?
-In the bedroom.
He's a sIeepyhead.
Ifyou watched the national news
just last week...
...you might have seen
a similar case in Boston...
...of a decorated cop accused of murder.
HeIIo?
Have you seen the news?
The cop was shooting first.
And he kept on shooting.
Lou's coming to get you.
He'II bring you down
for more conversation.
-Lou?
-No.
-They get him yet?
-No. Not yet.
I gotta go.
Here. Put these cIothes on.
Get dressed right away.
-Why?
-Just do what I teII you, pIease!
Are you ready?
AImost. What's going on here?
We're just going to pIay
a IittIe trick on somebody.
CooI.
We're going out the window.
What about my dad?
He's sIeeping. He's stiII asIeep.
-Excuse me, Sister. How're you doing?
-Good.
Good.
Does "apocaIypse" mean anything to you?
Sure it does.
"ApocaIypse" was the Greek word
for "reveIation."
"ReveIation"?
-You mean Iike the book of the BibIe?
-Yes.
ReveIation.
AII right. Thank you.
Pack of cigarettes.
-Any speciaI kind?
-No, any kind.
Okay, out of five.
Detective Hobbes?
Sir, you forgot your change.
Detective Hobbes.
I want to taIk to you.
Go, Sam. Run! Down the stairs,
down the stairs! Go!
AII units in the area--
Why don't you cIose that coat up?
Cigarettes?
I thought you quit.
I thought they were bad for you.
I did quit and they are bad for you.
You know what's going on?
The poIice think that I did some bad things.
-You are the poIice.
-Not anymore.
Why do they think you did that?
Because....
Because somebody...
...made it Iook Iike I did.
I once saw that on a show.
I want to taIk to you
about something eIse, too.
About your dad.
He's not asIeep, is he?
No, son. He's not asIeep.
Did it hurt?
I don't think so.
-Do you think he's gonna go to Heaven?
-Yes.
Yes, I do.
If anybody deserves to go to Heaven,
it's your dad.
I think so, too.
We've got no pIace eIse to go.
This is my nephew, Sam.
Okay. Hi, Sam.
Nice to meet you. I'm Gretta.
You're in your pajamas.
I wasn't expecting company,
but I'm gIad you're here.
Why don't you go over there
by the firepIace and get warm.
AzazeI wrote on his chest.
UnIess I do something--
I'II get you a coffee.
Thank you.
I think I got my mind
around this thing now, but Iet me...
...Iet me run this by you, okay?
After the host body dies...
...the demon can survive
for one breath or 500 cubits, right?
At the same time...
...AzazeI says to me when he moves
as spirit no man can resist.
So someone he can't get into by touch,
he can stiII get into by spirit.
Because, if when he's in spirit form...
...he's fighting for his Iife,
he's going to be that much more powerfuI.
PIease teII me what you're going to do.
Whatever I do...
...I have to make sure
that you and Sam are safe.
Will you take him somewhere...
...nobody knows about?
Even me.
Listen....
I gotta go.
You're gonna stay with Gretta
for a IittIe whiIe.
Maybe for a Iong whiIe.
And I want you to remember this:
Whatever peopIe say about me...
...or whatever I do...
...I just want you to remember
that I'm doing it for you.
Because I Iove you.
You understand?
I'm gonna go back to sIeep...
...and when I wake up
everything is gonna be just the way it was.
Thank you.
You know what this means, right?
I'm ready.
Hey, Jonesy, how're you doing?
Look, I'm worried, man.
What are you gonna do?
Where are you gonna go?
I'm going nowhere.
I'm taking a Iong drive...
...where nobody wiII find me...
...and sit by the water and think.
I gotta ask you something.
Yeah, shoot.
We've been partners a long time.
Twelve plus, Jonesy. Twelve plus.
So, is there anything you gotta tell me?
Yeah, remember what
we were talking about the other night?
When the moment comes...
...you know it.
Be careful, okay?
I'll see you, partner.
Yeah, you too.
Be good.
You're probably wondering:
What am I doing?
This is where things get a little tricky.
It'sjust him and me now.
Hobbes versus Azazel.
I thought I had him.
But he thought he had me, too.
Come on out.
I know you're here.
I knew you'd come.
Haven't you done enough?
You made me kiII an innocent man. You...
...murdered my brother!
Come out, you son of a bitch!
How much more fun can you have!
Jesus, Hobbes.
What are you taIking about?
I didn't do any of that.
Me, I'm the poor schmo
they sent up here to bring you in.
So it's you now.
It's me.
Who'd you expect it'd be?
Now drop your gun, Hobbes.
I know you've got one.
Or what?
You'II shoot me?
Where is the fun in that?
Fuck you, huh?
You're making me do this.
Now, drop the goddamn gun.
Do what he says, Hobbes.
Jonesy?
Who eIse is out here, huh?
Lou? Tiff? Come on out!
No, it's just the two of us.
The gun, Hobbes.
Jonesy, you know I didn't do this.
You know I didn't do any of it.
I know that, Hobbes.
We both want to beIieve you,
but we've gotta bring you in.
Stan....
I don't know if I can do this.
What the fuck you taIking...?
Say Hobbes disappears into the woods....
We drive his car into the Iake.
End of story. What's wrong with that?
We bring the son of a bitch in.
That's why we're up here.
He did it, fine.
He didn't do it, even better.
But it's not our job to decide.
Now drop the goddamn gun!
Jonesy?
Put the goddamn gun down.
Okay.
Thank you.
I'm sorry, Stan.
Been on the force so many years you think
you've seen it aII, but you haven't.
Life aIways gives you one more surprise.
One more.
Sometimes it's a big one.
AzazeI.
I'm your partner, man.
You're free. Run.
Keep thinking, Hobbes.
How about that!
Jonesy's fucked. He just kiIIed his boss.
Jonesy's fucked!
You're fucked!
One at a time, huh?
That's how we do it. One by one.
OIIy-oIIy-oxen-free!
"Time
"Is on my side
"Yes, it is
"Time
"Is on my side"
You Iike the Stones, Hobbes?
I bet you didn't, you big Monkee-fan pussy.
Time's up!
See the deaI?
If I kiII you...
...it's just the finaI...
...pathetic chapter...
...in the Iife of a disgraced hero.
Just one more piece of shit, human scum.
But...
...turn it around.
If I die...
...I enter you...
...put 20 more murders on your tab...
...before you go down.
Maybe your nephew or that...
...chippy you were taIking to.
How do you want to do this?
I die, you die?
What's maximum fun? Can you guess...
...what maximum fun is?
Sure you can.
Now that I've pIayed you
from the outside...
...maximum fun is...
...I become you.
You got me, Hobbes. You got me good.
But I gotta ask you something.
You wouIdn't Iet me kiII myseIf.
Why is that?
Because I need more time.
Time for what, asshoIe?
Five hundred cubits.
That's a Iong way, AzazeI.
If Jonesy dies too fast...
...as powerfuI as you are...
...I might never get away from you.
Oh, he's catching on.
What? You think you're going to win?
God wiIIing.
You never know.
Let me ask you something.
Why do you think...
...MiIano...
...came aII the way out here...
...in the middIe of nowhere?
To die, the IittIe chickenshit.
I don't think so.
I think that he wanted to do...
...what I'm going to do.
-OnIy he couIdn't puII it off.
-PuII what off?
Oh, come on, AzazeI.
Open your eyes.
Look around sometime.
Here we are in this beautifuI pIace...
...not another human being
around for miIes.
It's just you and me.
What is this? You don't smoke anymore.
That's right. I don't.
You know why?
Because cigarettes kiII.
EspeciaIIy cigarettes Iaced with poison.
BuIIshit.
Same poison that you used
to kiII my brother.
Fuck you.
It's beautifuI, isn't it?
Isn't it so sweet?
We die together...
...just you and me.
"Time
"Is on my side
"Yes, it is"
Fuck you, motherfucker!
I'm sorry, Jonesy.
I'm sorry.
So, like I said at the start...
...I was beaten...
...outsmarted, poisoned...
...by Detective John Hobbes.
Can you imagine what it feels like
to be alive for thousands ofyears...
...and realize you're actually going to die...
...because some self-righteous cop decided
he was going to save the fucking world?
Yes, a demon can die...
...and Hobbes figured out
how to beat me at my own game.
So what?
The war isn't over, I promise you.
Not by a long shot.
You forgot something, didn't you?
At the beginning I said
I was going to tell you...
...about the time I almost died.
See you around.
