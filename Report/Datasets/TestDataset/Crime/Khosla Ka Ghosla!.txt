What happened boss?
Some one's dead.
Whose?
That same guy who used to fight
with the newspaper..
.. vendor every morning,
he has a daughter..
.. who has a healthy figure,
she's not to be seen today?
He used to buy fruits for Rs 30..
.. and he used to complain about it 300 times.
Oh, God, God, God,
we shouldn't criticize the dead.
Who criticizes when alive?
This is the best opportunity.
Everything is by God's grace sister, the bill.
- 120 Rupees?
OK, now that he isn't alive..
.. doesn't mean you could give any calculation.
Do you know? He used to keep an account..
.. of each and everything on the
Chinese calculator.
Mummy.. is it matching?
Child, at least today u should have
worn a salwar kameez, isn't it?
Mummy, this Sunday there are
many dead bodies coming at..
.. the ghat, and so there would be
many people too..
.. coming there, I can't wear salwar suit there.
Is he going to be alive again
if she wears a salwar Kameez?
See, I am telling you nothing has happened.
Nothing happened?
I have to cook food for so many people..
.. it's eleven o'clock.
Nothing's done yet?
I say cook some kidney beans and rice.
Instead of two,
cook it till it whistles four times.
And add a bit of soda to it.
It will cook faster. Simple.
Kidney beans and rice?
The kidney beans spoon was in one hand
and the remote in the other
Is that all?
Sachin's sixer
OK,OK, but what happened to Khosla saab?
We have no idea uncle.
He's never told us..
.. what he is up to...
soon after watching the match..
.. we saw him fallen on the sofa itself.
This watch of yours is nice...
is it an imported one?..
.. I too was thinking of buying one.
Hey bunty dear, how are you?
- I am fine, uncle. How are you?
How much is it for uncle?
- Maybe 3700.
He was my companion for 8 years
in the chartered bus..
.. and was thinking of buying some plot.
Lets see who sits next to me
henceforth in the adjoining seat.
Cherry, have you made arrangements
for some tea?
No idea uncle,
you may please have a look yourself.
Mummy... Mummy where are the car keys?
Dear, it must be in his pocket..
.. he had got the car reversed for you last night.
I'll be late from the office in the evening,
got a presentation. Bye.
No problem - The boy is very busy..
.. he is the apple of Khosla sir's eye.
This picture is made very well by her isn't it?
You too, early in the morning.
I've been requesting you from the
last 20 yrs not to give me..
.. kidney beans at night,
see I've ended with a gas problem..
.. and I have to visit the plot too.
Oh, you have to go to the plot at 9 o'clock..
.. but you have woken up at five
in the morning itself.
Neither do you sleep
nor do you allow others to sleep.
Why should I allow everyone to sleep?
You must be making preparations
to move to the new plot.
Mr. Khosla, now you people will be known..
.. as the family from south Delhi.
Your family must be very excited, isn't it?
We are going for the very first time.
We will be going at two.
Breathe in, breathe out.
Breathe, inhale again.
Now start, Ha ha ha..
What happened?
Cherry was saying,
he won't go to see the plot.
Why? The whole family is going..
.. is he a big joint secretary that he is refusing?
That you ask him only.
Why should I ask him?
Is he doing any favor to me by coming?
Let him not come if he is not coming.
Why should I spoil my Sunday
because of others?
I will also not go, no one will go.
Once this gate opens,
there's a garden in front.
Ok? And in front of the garden
like this the stairs are going..
.. and from there when you go ahead..
The house is yet to be made
and the thieves have already come..
.. yes, then, in front of the garden
will be our drawing room.
What should I do with this?
Pick it up and throw it out.
Please concentrate a bit,
you are the engineer..
.. of the full house,
you are going to construct it, look here.
Papa, I'm a computer engineer.
I don't know about these bricks and stones,
I'm watching, you continue.
Ok. I'll explain you the
meaning of south facing plot.
But from here, where does the south fall?
Just make him understand.
There.
And from our present house?
From there also it is there only.
Oh! Then why have we taken the land..
.. thirty kilometers far from there?
Where are you going there?
Two minutes papa.
Afterwards you play with that.. what I mean is..
He's not playing, he's reading message.
Papa I'm telling you this,
you're becoming illiterate day-by-day.
Papa, I have to leave.
Leave! Where to?
I have to go to office.
Go to office? On Sunday?
I know you're working for a
multinational company,..
.. but Sunday is for every country.
Tell them it's a holiday.
No papa, I'll have to go. I'm leaving.
we have to decide everything..
.. what marble is to be put
on the floor and for the walls?
That you all decide, I'm getting late.
Come on! Your floor
we'll have to discuss with you only.
Papa, whatever floor you'll decide,
I'll stay in that, but now..
Bunty, drop me.
Sunday also he doesn't have time.
Company people are sucking his blood.
Poor thing.
Three parties were interested
for this property uncle..
.. one had even given the money in cash..
.. but I withdraw it in between, isn't it?
Dear hard work has to done.
Yes, yes.
Vijender, frankly speaking
I have spent all my life's earning..
.. in this.. this location that is.
The main thing is that
my younger son Cherry's office..
.. is very close to this place.
Yes, yes.
.. these multinational companies
catch the intelligent persons..
Uncle you brought the cash, isn't it?
Cash? - Cash.. - Oops..
Actually Cherry used to look after it.
But he works even on a Sunday.
Thirty two thirty two thirty two thirty three..
.. thirty three thirty three thirty four thirty four-
Vijender, count carefully,
it's my whole life's earning.
Don't bother uncle,
it's my daily job, thirty four thirty..
.. four thirty five... take this, it's complete now.
Congratulations uncle.
And uncle, when you are constructing your home?
Dear, I have done my job,
now who wants to stay there..
.. let them worry.
I told to my younger son Cherry..
.. what we say in English that it's your baby now?
Now, can we go?
Now my sons will take it further.
Yes, yes, sons are there for what matter.
Meghna? Meghna? Meghna!
Hi, Bill Gates
Hey, what are you doing?
Just like that.
What?
Sometimes you should do
like this it's good for health.
Will you try? Should I teach?
No, Thank you
Cherry, why you are so boring?
Ok. Come here, come on, hold the leg.
Oh God, look at your face.
Don't worry, I am not going to kiss you.
Shall we move?
Shall we go for the rehearsal?
Ok. Come hold me.
Why?
Hey what happened just hold me
But why?
Because you are my boy friend.
Now hold me, just hold me!
Otherwise you will fall.. like this.
Like this!
And Bill Gates, celebrating Sunday?
Hey! Leave it.
What?
I told you to stop smoking, isn't it?
She knows, I can't refuse,
she is taking disadvantage of the same.
Yes I do, leave it.
Thank you!
Next month there is Bangalore theatre festival..
.. will you come along with us?
There is a problem for next month, Bapu.
She is working too hard,
give her moral support by coming.
This coward will give me moral support? This?
Take two days leave dear.
It's not the matter of leave, Bapu..
.. actually I won't be here at that time.
Then where will you be?
New York.
New York? Wow! On tour?
No, I had applied to a software company..
.. if everything goes well,
then from next month I have to join.
How come you never told me?
You two really keep it close, don't you?
Anyways, very good,
I will always wish you to be successful..
.. keep climbing higher,
but don't forget us after reaching there.
Don't be stupid, Bapu,
how can some one forget you.
She will forget..
Yes.
Bapu! -What is it?
There was a call from Bangalore..
.. they were asking about the next months show.
New York, is it?
Actually I thought,
it wouldn't be right telling anyone..
.. before things got finalized.
What's the use of telling some one?
Every body at home would be happy.
Their son is going to be an N.R.I.!
You didn't tell at home?
Cherry you are going away..
.. and you didn't inform at your home.
Are you mad?
Meghna, you how my papa is,
I just don't know how to tell him.
Why, what's the problem?
The way you told me, tell him too..
Hello. -Where are you, sir?
The queue is about to finish. Where are you?
I was about to leave, Asif.
Iqbal. Asif Iqbal. Do one thing,
get 1 photo and reach here immediately.
But you said, six will do.
If the US embassy did what I wished..
.. then whole Karol Bagh would be California!
Everything will be closed after 1'Oclock..
.. and they are closed for 1 week then.
And then these guys will be in a war then..
.. and you will be sitting here forever.
If you want a visa in 30 days,
then come with a photo in 10 minutes.
See you. - But.. Asif!
You are right on time!
Looks like you will reach America also on time.
These are the papers you asked for the visa.
Will you have tea? - No, thank you.
There! You screwed up!
Mixed your name with your dad's in the hurry.
No, it is the way it is.
What does it mean?
You mean that your Dads name is
Kamal Kishore Khosla..
.. and your name is Chiraunjee Lal Khosla?
- Yes.
To think what they are going to
do to your name in America!
You check the papers!
Chiraunjee! Isn't it something
that is to be eaten?
Whoever has named you,
surely he must be your enemy.
Cherry brother, Papa is here.
Cherry, come here.
Everyone is waiting for you.
All the decisions are
waiting for your arrival.
Where is the name plate, Bunty?
- It's in your lap!
This is the nameplate. Look at it.
Well, here it is. K. K. and Sudha Khosla..
.. that is me and your mother.
This is B.K Khosla. That is Bunty.
And this Ciraunji Khosla, that is you!
- How is it?
I told you not to make it in gold..
.. these cheap things are
not liked by all, Bunty.
We will redo it in marble.
But the names look good, don't they?
Papa, this will change.
- This will change.. what?
Papa, I am changing my name.
Changing your name?
What do you mean?
I didn't understand.
I am changing my name.
He has just come from the office.
And you are discussing the name plate.
Take, drink water.
Water? Let him drink water.
But I did not understand.
Papa, I don't want to be named
Chiraunji Lal Khosla.
Why? - Because I don't like this name!
You don't like? It is your name.
There is no question of like and dislike!
Because.. you won't understand, papa.
Sit down for a minute!
You aren't drunk, are you?
You are the limit.
If he wishes to say something, listen!
Listen to him?
Today he says I am changing my name!
Then he'll want to change his home!
Then he will want to change his family!
And you are speaking for him!
What's there to speak for, papa?
I just want to change my name,
what's so great in it?
Ok. Ok. You don't change your name,
you just shorten it.
C. L. Khosla?
This is fine, you get to keep your name,
and also the change!
I don't wish to shorten my name,
I wish to change it.
But what is wrong with a short name?
Take mine for instance.
K.K.Khosla, short for Kamal Kishore Khosla.
Papa, you like Kamal Kishore
from head to toe.
But do I look Chiraunji Lal from any angle?
Let me suggest, Hrithik is a hit these days.
You name yourself Hrithik.
No, no. Vivek.
Talk softly.
By the way, how will Yuvraj be?
These sport stars aren't safe
to be named after.
He stops scoring runs,
and this guy will be kicked.
Why don't you take up an English name?
That really impresses folks these days.
What? - Like Ricky Martin?
Yes. Ricky Martin. That's good.
"Living the Vi Da Loca. "
Mr. Khosla. What difference does a name make?
Even if he changes name,
he will remain your son!
Actually, Chiraunji Lal sounds like a...
.. street peddler than a software engineer.
These guys nowadays think in a
multi-national manner.
They don't like these Indian names,
to them it is a bad joke!
He was named Chiraunji Lal
by my mother, Sahani sir.
You know how they used to
name kids those days.
Now the mother is no more.
She won't come back and
check if the name is changed!
You change it.
Don't take cudgels with youth.
You need to compromise with him. Compromise!
Compromise?
The whole country is running
because of compromise.
Just compromise a bit,
it will insure your old age.
I don't need insurance, Sahani sir!
You know how the elder one turned out?
- I know.
I have high hopes from this second one.
That's why I am saying,
make friends with him.
Sahani sir, how can I make friends with a boy..
.. who does not like his own name?
You want to teach me,
how to make friends with an young son?
I have heard, that first you put the ice,
then the soda..
.. and then the whisky!
No. You pour the whisky first..
then ice.. and then soda.
No, first you put the ice,
that's why they call it on the rocks.
Then do it in your own way.
- Buddy, why are you touchy?
You go and get some Coke
for yourself and mummy.
Why Coke? Can't we drink 'Whisky'?
Sudha, call her in the kitchen.
Sudha, there is no need of
calling me in the kitchen.
You also come here and have a drink!
You can fry the snacks later!
Ok, Ok. Granted.
Go ahead and have your drinks.
Shall we start? - Slowly.
These things should be enjoyed slowly.
I have seen Sahani sir while drinking. Slowly.
It's called, Hold The Drink.
Now, shall we start?
- Buddy, let Cherry come!
Isn't he late?
Check out, if he is waiting outside.
Why should he be waiting outside?
You just go and look, please.
Start drinking please.
You are already pissed.
Look. You have a long life ahead.
He has come.
Come here Cherry. Start frying the snacks.
Cherry has arrived.
Aren't you a bit late today?
No, papa. This is when I come every day.
Papa has thrown a party for the Plot!
Let's have that list of names.
We couldn't finish the discussion
of your name that day.
I have tried changing it.
Chiraunji Lal could be Chiraunji Kumar.
But no. This is a good name.
Chandankumar
Then there is Chanakya kumar,
Chanchal kumar..
Papa, I need to check my e-mails..
Buddy, you work so hard.
Also try to celebrate..
Is the drink ready? Come, lets start.
Take it. 3 cheers for New Khosla Kunj.
Plot no. 32, Sapna Vihar. Cheers!
What happened?
- Papa, I don't drink this drink.
Then what do you drink? Beer?
Bunty, go and get beer.
Papa, I don't drink.
- You don't drink?
No mater, come, have 1 drink with us
for good time's sake.
By the way, too much drinking
is not good, Bunty.
Papa, when I said I don't drink, I mean it!
Do you think we are fools here,
that we are drinking?
Is Mr. Sahani a fool, that he drinks every evening?
Is the whole world a bunch of drunks,
and you alone are wise?
What is this you are doing?
What am I doing?
I am trying to have a drink with my young son.
But he is feeling ashamed to drink with me,
don't I understand?
You go inside. - He won't go.
I need to talk with him.
What is there to talk?
- There are 100 things.
A new home is being built,
there are 100 things to do, to plan.
I don't want to do any planning!
No! You have to!
If you wish to stay in this home..
.. you have to do what everything is doing!
I don't want to live in this house.
- Shut up. -Why?
Are the Multinationals giving you
a big mansion?
Or this house is not your worth?
Papa, I am going.
- Where are you going?
I am going to America!
- He is going to America?
How can you go to America?
It is not an easy thing!
Stop dreaming big, and stay on the ground.
Papa, I have got an job there!
Watch out for what you have.
Or you will loose that also!
You will fall so hard that
you will lose that big mouth of yours!
Take care for what you have!
And who is waiting to roll out
a red carpet for you there?
Papa I have got a job in America.
I had applied to a company.
They have appointed me.
I have to leave in a month.
And what about your floor?
There's Bunty.
Brother, can I come in?
Your Milk.
When are you going to America?
I have applied now.
The interview has to be given.
Your interview will be nice.
You will be visiting during vacations?
Hey, are you sleeping?
- No. I am dancing.
Dude, why taking out Papa-ji's anger on me?
Are you really going to America?
You made it dude. Call us also sometime.
Let me go first.
I thought of applying an advance.
How are your shares doing?
Same as old.
I am planning to get into real estate
once the house is finished.
'Khosla Estate Agency'
What do you say? - check it out.
Get some sleep. I have some left.
Dude! Don't forget after going to America.
Shall I serve the dinner?
No mama.
You didn't tell before.
I was about to, mama.
Your current job is not Ok?
No mama, it's not that.
But I cant do with just Ok.
You all can join me in a few years.
What will we do there at this age?
What are you doing here?
Your papa is building a new house.
What is the need? For all this fuss, mess?
He is thinking about your needs.
There should be a big house.
Everyone has own independent room.
even I am..
Forget. You are here for a month more.
Tomorrow is the consecration.
Don't refuse..
Papa will feel better if you come along.
"The thing that you planned,
the world does not agree. "
"The dream is not there anymore. "
"You kept laughing, never knew any sorrow. "
"But no one remains your own now. "
"Understand gradually, know this world. "
"Something can be done even now. "
"What will I do now Buddy. "
You haven't forgotten the way, I hope?
"What will I do now Buddy. "
I don't know where are we going?
Stop. Stop for a minute.
Go back, buddy.
Hold it! I find all the plots as same.
All the plots appear the same.
Where is the south?
This is the same place. Look, the board.
Yes, I had also seen the board.
But how come there is a wall here?
It's written "Do not pee here".
Have we come to pee here?
I think we have come to a different sector.
This way the whole day will pass away.
Can't we ask someone?
Hello. Hello.
Is any one here?
What is it?
Buddy, sector 30.. plot number.. - 32.
What?
- Where would plot number 32 be?
It is this same here.
Sector 30, plot number 32 is this same?
I told you it this one.
By the way, what do you want?
What do you mean what we want?
This plot belongs to us!
And who are you? -What?
Hey, who are you?
- I am the watchman.
Your plot?
This plot belongs to our Khurana sir.
Which Khurana sir? Who the hell is Khurana?
What is going on here?
He is the owner of this plot, who else?
You watch your mouth or..
Sir, why are you fighting with me?
I am just a guard.
Where will we find him?
I don't know that.
He comes over once a while.
You.. -Wait, wait, wait.
Lets go to Vijender, seems like a confusion.
He only can tell us.
Shall I wait, or leave?
- You keep sitting behind.
Two minutes and he wants to catch a flight.
Where is this Vijender?
Uncle, how do I know who is this Khurana?
What is this Vijender?
We bought the plot from you,
and you are saying you don't know?
Uncle, there are thousands of plots.
You cant expect me to keep tabs
who is building a wall on which plot.
How can I know? -Why?
Once you receive the money,
your responsibility is over?
Aunty.. - Forget aunty, speak with me!
That day you were banging away
counting the cash!
Politely tell us what the matter is,
otherwise we have..
.. other means to get the truth out of you.
Uncle-ji, the plot is in your name? -Yes!
Are the documents in your name?
The documents are there that is why..
You had taken the possession
by checking yourself?
What do you mean by taken?
You only had given us yourself.
Then uncle-ji, my job is done, isn't it?
It is your plot of land, so you will look after it.
But you..
Uncle-ji, please forgive me;
it is my lunchtime.
If you need any other help.
You let me know.
As it is you have other means too,
you can try them.
Hey come out!
Hey watchman! Come out!
Hey watchman!
Open the gate and come out.
What is the matter, sir?
Why are you shouting so much?
Brother, there was a watchman here..
.. where did he go? - No!
There is no watchman here! Only I am here.
You tell me, what is the matter?
One minute! Look here sir,
we do not have any enmity..
.. against you, but what I wanted to say is that..
Oh uncle, by having enmity with me..
.. are you going to thrash me?
Listen to me! Just go back two steps.
Go back! Go!
Brother, I would like to make a request to you.
This plot is mine on which at the moment you..
Brother, if this plot would have been yours..
.. then you would be standing here in my place.
And I would have been standing in your place.
Understood!
This plot belongs to Khurana sir.
- What? -Yes!
Where do we find him? -What?
My brother, you may find him anywhere else..
.. but he is not here. Understood!
Who are you?
I am your uncle, Ombir!
Now tell me what are you going to do?
Brother, when we are telling you that..
Hey uncle, when I do not want to listen to your talk..
.. what is the use of talking?
You will understand only
when your hands and legs will..
.. be broken in front of these ladies, is it?
"What shall we do now?"
"Where shall we go now?"
"What shall we do,
what shall we do now, my brother!"
What is the matter?
You saw how Vijayender was talking?
That day he was so nice and today you heard..
.. how he sounded?
What is there to see?
No, I want to know what is there to see?
You all have still not understood?
The whole day you are just talking
of the plot and nothing else.
Now go and do whatever you want.
The plot has been seized.
Yes, Mr. Vijayender,
what I was trying to tell you that..
.. in the morning we were in tension that is why..
.. we spoke a little rudely.
And you too unnecessarily took it to heart.
No! No, we had gone to the site.
Okay, are you in a hurry?
The thing is that if you could
introduce us to Mr. Khurana..
.. we could solve the misunderstanding.
I know that we are troubling you.
But you know when someone is in trouble..
.. then we think of only our near ones.
I am obliged, thank you!
Thank you! Thank you.
What was he saying?
He was a little angry
because of the afternoon talk.
Nobody has seized the land.
There is a misunderstanding.
Someone has taken it to be their land..
.. and built a wall there. - Papa!
Vijaynder was saying that every month someone..
...or the other does this blunder.
And then he apologizes.
Papa I think..
You have already voiced your thoughts.
You go, you go to America!
As it is you know everything!
You already made a statement that
the land is seized.
Now you leave the rest to me.
You go and make arrangements..
.. to go back to America.
Then? -What then?
He must have again gone to that agent to beg.
You did not go?
What difference would it make me going there?
I don't know anything of all about this.
Anyway, I am going now.
What is the use of involving in all this now?
You tell me! You do not have
any rehearsals today? - No!
The Bangalore festival is going to
take place, isn't it?
Which play are you going to perform?
Cherry! How can you leave them
in the lurch and walk away?
Now what is wrong with you?
No! How can you just go?
Meghna, this job is of the
property agents and the brokers.
By me staying here,
nothing is going to get solved.
As it is the date of my return is almost fixed.
Cherry, you are right! You should go!
Meghna! - I am getting late; I have to go.
But you said that you don't have
any rehearsals today.
So can't I go anywhere else besides my rehearsals?
Where? - How does it matter to you?
Meghna, what is this?
Cherry, why are you wasting your time?
You have nothing left over here.
- Meghna! Meghna!
Yes, Mr. Vijayender-ji! Yes, one minute!
One minute! One minute! Yes, tell me
Go get a pen! Yes, one minute!
Please hold the line.
Bunty has gone to get the pen.
Yes, what were you saying?
Go take the car out.
"How much you were troubled?"
"How much work you have done?"
"Keep your heart tied down. "
"Now whatever has happened my brother. "
"Now what are we going to do?"
'Now we have to think of something. "
This is the Kharbanda farm.
"If you are smart enough
you will think of something. "
Baweja.. Baweja farm.
We are finding all the names, but we cannot find..
.. the name that we are searching.
Khurana farm! Khurana farm!
Is Mr. Khurana there?
Is Mr. Khurana there?
Yes, he is there; come we will go.
You do not reach on time.
Don't you have any work to do?
As it is you do not work and on top of that..
.. you give excuses.
I will not spare any one of you.
I will just have a word with Mr. Khurana.
No, he is not the one.
What do you think of yourself?
Madam-ji! -Yes!
How much more time will Mr. Khurana take?
You should have taken an appointment
and then come.
Madam, what are you talking?
I think he must be busy in some important work.
He is doing the veneration.
Uncle, please be seated.
Go and ask her, where shall we get water?
This time you go and ask.
And at least comb your hair.
What was I saying..
Who is Mr. Khosla here? -Yes!
Mr. Khurana! - No! My name is Munjal.
You did not meet him?
Go up and then go to the right
and then to the left.
Why are you sitting here?
He was saying that they had
cut many vulgar scenes.
Uncle-ji! Kishen Khurana!
Kishen Khurana! K.K. Khosla!
How are you? - I am fine sir, you?
Has anyone offered you tea or coffee?
They did not ask you? Didn't they ask you?
Did they ask you or not?
No!
Sarvesh! Come! Come!
How much do I pay you?
Tell me, how much do I pay you?
Three thousand!
Three thousand! Three thousand!
You scoundrel, will you take
fifty thousand to offer water?
All lazy people stay in this house.
Order me, uncle-ji! What would you like to have?
No! You have come here for the first time.
You will definitely have to take something.
Water! -And you? - Pepsi!
Uncle-ji, tell me! What can I do for you?
Yes sir, that plot in New Sapna Vihar sector 30..
.. plot number.. - 32. -Yes 32.
That is ours sir!
That is yours?
Then take it! If it is yours, then take it.
Look here sir, that plot is in our name.
If you want you can check the documents.
Whom are you showing the documents to?
I can show you 100 documents..
.. against your one document.
Do you want to see?
Sir.. that plot..
What is there in the plot?
It is just a piece of land. Am I going to take it away?
As you can see by the grace of 'Matarani'..
.. I have everything here.
There is nothing less!
This money, this land, everything will be left back.
We have come empty handed
and we will go also empty handed.
What do you say? -Yes, that is true.
The main happiness are the children.
We spend our entire life slogging
for the children.
Yes sir, you are right!
My other son is a computer engineer.
Sir, actually we are in a hurry.
Papa-ji has also left the car open.
So if we could please speak to the point.
Is it necessary for you speak in between?
Is he your son? He is good! Good!
He is short tempered!
Tell him to pray and meditate.
Twice a day you recite
'Vaishanav devi's' name.
It will help you.
I will tell you one thing, uncle.
Your son is at least sitting with you.
My son feels ashamed to sit with me.
We have given birth to you;
we have brought you up.
Nursed you when you were sick.
And you feel ashamed to sit
with your father?
Bloody snakes!
Khosla sir, you and me will talk, okay?
You go and see what happened
to your Pepsi, go!
Sir, actually I..
Who gave you the address
of the friend's colony?
Mr. Vijayendra-ji, of the world
famous properties.
Vijayender! Vijayender! How is he?
He is absolutely fine! We have become
good friends now.
He was the one who did the deal of our plot.
Very good!
So uncle-ji! You do like this!
You talk to Vijayender only.
I did not understand?
Uncle-ji, your work is done.
This is the first time in so many years..
.. that Mr. Khurana in the first meeting
has told someone..
.. that this is your plot.
He was praising you a lot.
He said that whatever Vijayender
says would be done.
How much is the worth of this plot?
You know it! All together it must be
around 30 lacks.
- What? What?
Do you want us to pay 15 lacks
for our own land?
You just forget that this is your plot.
Now you have to think that you are
buying the plot..
.. from Mr. Khurana again.
Look here! If you get this 15 lacks.
That means you have got half the rate
from the market price.
And what better deal can you ask for?
Do you know what you are saying?
You mean to say that we have to pay
Your land? And put your hand down.
What do you mean by put your
hands down?
You think we are fools?
You listen to me.. you keep
your hand down.
You are showing me your hand
every now and then.
This is our everyday job! Understood.
Uncle-ji, please make him understand.
Rest I your wish.
And in such a price where do you get
a land like this?
You think and let me know. 15 lacks.
For what are we supposed
to pay 15 lacks?
As if he will demand and we will give him.
If you listen to me, then there is only one way..
.. to handle such people.
What is it?
There is a community of wrestlers in Dev Nagar.
They have a very good reputation.
They can vacate anything, house, building or land.
If you say so, then I will go and find out.
My dear son, we are middle class people.
All this fight and quarrelling is
not our cup of tea.
Then give 15 lacks if you have.
Khosla sir! Khosla sir!
No! Please do not get depressed.
Bhabhi, at least you make him understand.
They have snatched away the savings
of my life, Mr. Sahani.
My land!
It will not go anywhere! Nothing
will happen to our plot.
Cherry dear, you get ready!
We will go to the police station.
We are going to the police station.
Now sir-ji, you only tell us
If some comes and seizes your property.
Then what will a decent man do?
First of all you stop calling me Sir-ji.
Khosla sir is like my father.
Thank you! Thank you my son! Thank you!
Uncle, even I am from a middle class
family like you.
Even I am earning a salary.
I can understand your pain.
Actually after listening to some
rumours about the police..
.. people do not come to us for help.
And finally they have to bear their own loss.
These are very normal cases.
In this you have to go once and be a little stern..
.. to the party who has seized the land. That's it!
What is the price of your land?
Including the registration and everything..
.. it comes to around 30 lacks.
Ad how much is he demanding?
What is his address?
You come along with me right away.
I will slap him and finalise the deal in 10 lacks.
You give me 2 lacks.
will be finalised in 12 lacks.
Even then you are still in profit with 3 lacks.
You are happy and I am happy.
Uncle you will be finished, but the case wont be.
It is better to pacify Khurana in 15 minutes..
.. rather than to pacify the judge in 15 years.
If you say so then I can talk it out in 14 lacks.
Khosla sir, there is nothing to worry.
Khurana is our man.
I will finalise your deal in 12 or 13.
The rest you can donate to the party fund.
We will do as much as we can.
Strikes, agitations, public interest litigations.
Then they will automatically
come down to 12 lacks.
And then you can decide how much
of donation to give.
Hello!
Mr. Chironjilal! Aasif Iqbal!
Do you want to go to America or not?
They must have built a wall.
Only with mud or with bricks?
Here! Sign here!
How much have they demanded?
Fifty percent?
Are you going to give them?
From where are you too going to give?
What is your father’s age? - 56.
He must be about to retire?
He has one more year.
He must have invested all
his provident fund money.
And you too are going to America.
You are going to America, isn't it?
What do you think that I am filling
this form for nothing?
Yes, sign here!
What name did you say? Khurana!
It may be, Khurana or it may be Baweja.
What are you going to do about it?
I do not know about, Baweja.
But if it is, Khurana, then I can do
a lot many things.
Look here, boss! Your job is to
issue a visa to me.
I am paying you the concerned money.
Do not try and interfere in between.
You will not get anything.
And 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Oh my God!
I don't think I will be able to do it.
Don't be silly! You will get it
in 5 minutes.
No, I will not be able to do it.
Meghna, listen!
I have a friend in New York.
He has an Indian Theatre Group there.
- So?
You did not understand?
He needs actors like you.
Don't you? Don't you need me?
Do you or don't you?
No, you don't!
Come we will go!
Why sir, don't you want to go?
No, it is okay! We will go!
Where are you barging inside?
Do you think it is your father’s house?
Hey Dharampal brother, he is my brother,
let him come in.
He is my brother.
Is he your brother? Okay! Come in.
Come in! Come in!
Hey you wrestlers, what is this?
Your plates are empty.
Take some more! Take some more!
Hey you all do not fill your stomach
too much.
At night you all have to stay awake.
Guru-ji, one sweet will not matter much.
A wrestler should always stay fit.
You go in! -What is this mummy?
I said you go in!
Aunty-ji! - Not now later!
Mr. Khosla! Come here!
Come and sit down.
See, I will show you.
See this, this is 300 square feet bungalow.
We emptied it in three days.
Three lacks fees!
And this is two rooms flat;
we emptied it in 8 hours.
And this is the bungalow
of the MP.
We emptied it in 3 hours.
But for this our Balbir Singh
had to go to jail.
Now it is okay that you do not
have the money.
But give us the money for winning.
Uncle-ji, you do not worry!
Even Hanuman could not lift
a mountain so quickly..
.. as quickly as we can vacate a land.
Hail Lord Human!
Break the enemies bones.
"These damsels are gorgeous. "
"The monkeys went and sat there. "
"They think that they are very great. "
"These gorgeous girls care
a damn for the world. "
Uncle, what do you do?
I am doing a job!
Will you drink milk?
Here take uncle; you strike first! - Me?
Why don't you do it?
A rule is a rule!
Come on hit hard!
Oh uncle-ji! If you hit like this,
then your hand will break.
See, this is how you hit!
Hit hard! Hit hard! Very good!
You go and sit in the car, I will get you some water.
Uncle-ji, what do you say?
Is it as it was before?
It is the same!
Hail Lord Hanuman!
Break the bones of the enemy.
Mr. Khosla! You did an amazing job
in the night.
You did not even inform me?
He did not even give me the time.
Everything was over before I
could even think.
And Khurana's men?
You should have seen their state.
They thought that their wall
has collapsed on their head.
They all ran away.
You take a wash!
Had Cherry also gone with you all?
Of course he too had come.
Now he is having a shower.
He does not like mud!
He too had gone?
What did I tell you?
K.K. Khosla! -Yes!
Who is Mr. K. K. Khosla?
I am Balwant Khosla.
I am K. K. Khosla! Tell me!
Come with me to the station.
For what?
There is a report against you.
Regarding what?
To capture Kishen Khurana's
land last night.
Inspector sir, from where did you
get this wrong report?
He owns this land.
The land is mine.
I have purchased it.
If you want I can show you
the documents.
I have them with me.
Leave the documents aside
and come along with me.
But I..
Inspector sir.. -You stay away.
Stay away!
I told you to stay away!
Cherry!
"Now you will have to pay. "
"You may live or you may die. "
"You will have to struggle for life. "
Cherry! Cherry!
Khosla sir! Khosla sir!
"Now what will you do my brother?"
"Where will you go my brother?"
"Now what will you do?
What will you do my brother?"
False documents.. attempt to murder..
.. and two counts of horticulture act.
I have heard, he has cut down
two trees also.
But sir. -Already so many charges.
And the other party is yet
to let loose there lawyer!
This is absurd! It's them who
has illegally occupied.
So did you file the report?
Yes, we had gone to the headquarter.
Then why have you come here?
Go there! Do you have any relative there?
The trouble happened in our area,
we got to be involved.
Do I have to spell it out to you?
Excuse me, just a minute.
The plot is ours, and the papers
are in our name.
Then how can you lock him
on their complaint?
I can lock him without any complaint,
what can you do?
What do you mean?
I'll tell you the meaning inside,
in the language you understand!
Don't boast of your English,
you impertinent fool!
You can't talk to me like that!
What do you think of yourself?
I'll show you the way you talk, you punk!
Get out! - Bloody corrupted,
bribe takers!
You call yourself the Police!
What do you think of yourself!
I am taking your age into consideration.
Or it will be the father and son
in the slammer!
This is a lock up, not an zoo.
Go away from here. Go!
Please, cool down, sir. - Sorry
What sorry?
- He's a kid, sir. A kid.
If he is a kid, leave him at home,
not on my head.
Now everything is in your hands,
only you can do something.
You say what needs to be done.
What is there to do? We will keep him
in the lock up..
.. till the other party arrives.
No sir, can't you let him go now,
and call us when they arrive?
Is it not possible I break your leg?
Give them an inch and they want a mile?
Go and wait outside!
It's all my fault.
I should not have got the wrestlers..
.. then this complaint wouldn't
have been there.
Papa has not even had a drop of water.
- Did he eat?
I offered, but he did not eat.
Papa is inside the lock up
because of me.
Cherry.. I am telling you as an elder brother.
You take off for America..
.. you don't get involved
and spoil your career.
These problems will keep going on..
I will take care of this.
You go.
Are you K.K.'s son? -Yes.
I am Munjal. Khurana sir
has sent me.
Come, lets get your papa
released, come.
Khosla sir, good morning. Sir.
O Khosla sir, I am sorry.
I am sorry, Khosla sir. I am sorry.
Did you have some tea?
Khurana sir has personally called
from Vaishnodevi.
Nothing wrong should happen
with Khosla sir.
He sent me here to settle things
and then call him.
But even you committed a mistake.
By calling wrestlers to settle things.
When the matter could be solved
by talking, what was the use?
Khosla sir, these property matters
are complicated..
.. that they cannot be settled later.
Khurana sir has 20 cases going on.
He will appoint one lawyer
You have done magic on Khurana sir.
He loves you. He said if Khosla
is ready to offer..
.. 12 lakhs, he personally will come
for the house warming ceremony.
Papa.
Now finish off this drama. Ok?
Khurana sir loves you.
Doesn't matter, you are back home,
even the plot will come.
Sahani sir, I don't want the plot.
But, papa. Why don't you want the plot?
I said, that's it!
Cherry is anyways leaving..
.. even Nikki will get married and leave.
This house is big enough for us both.
We don't need any plot.
Papa, just one minute.. - Enough.
Cherry brother, there is some one
to meet you.
The other day you came home,
but didn't come up?
Sorry, I saw you.
Dad ran into a spot of trouble..
What about the plot?
I don't know why..
If papa does not get the land back,
he will be a broken man.
I have to get the plot for him.
Before I go to New York.
Good. Need help?
Cherry, are you sure?
You think this man can help you?
I don't know, he was saying
something about Khurana.
Mr. Chironji Lal?
This is Asif. - Iqbal Asif.
There is time for you to leave?
Kiddo, park it.
It's my own. Easy for conveyance.
Tell me how can I help you?
You had said.. you had offered help
in Khurana matter.
If you need help, just ask.
Will you have tea?
Whatever Khurana has done with you..
.. Khurana and me used to do
the same with others.
I have worked with him for seven years.
Were you working with
Khurana previously?
That's what I thought.
But that devil has never any kin.
I had an ancestral land
in Saharanpur.
His eyes fell on that,
And I could not do anything.
he took it away in front of my eyes.
Then.. Khurana continued climbing..
.. and I started slipping down.
Anyway, forget about me.
Do you need help?
If Khurana has your land,
he must have the papers too.
When we have the papers,
how can they be with him?
I used to get the papers
made for him then.
Now it must be some one else.
It's easy.
Because you don't have any option
in the legal war.
The fastest way is to pay and get it
back from him.
Wow! That's some help. We wouldn't be here
if we had the money.
Where will we get it from?
We will rob some one.
Good idea. Why don't you rob
Khurana itself?
Come on, Asif dear. One second,
one second.
How?
Look, Khurana weakness is
his greed for land.
Why don't you sell him a dinky little
chunk of land?
If we had land to sell with us, then..
Sir, India is the worlds seventh largest
country in terms of land.
There's land every where,
you leave it to me.
You mean we sell him any plot of land?
Why any? We will sell him a nice one.
But who will sell it?
Not sell.. pretend to sell.
We did it often.
Just find a sophisticated looking guy,
who can also act.
Asif buddy, we came to you
to solve our problem..
.. and you are involving us in a new problem.
From where could we find such a man...
Dear Chiranuji Lal.. you have to find
the right solution to the right problem.
Think. Think.
You.. are you Ok?
Bapu, are you afraid of acting?
No, I am afraid of consequences.
What you are planning, it is called fraud!
And what Khurana has done with us,
what will you call that?
Bapu, you yourself say..
.. that don't act just for money,
but for a cause.
Bapu, Cherry's dad.. what could be
an better cause?
Bapu, you are acting for nothing
since 30 years.
Now, act for some ones good.
What if something goes wrong?
Bapu, I have never seen you making
mistakes while acting.
A person who himself stays
in a rented home..
.. what will he know about land
and property?
You leave that on me.
This is Asif.
Can I smoke? - Ok.
Bill Gates, look. I am doing this
for her. - Thank you.
And she is doing it for you.
The man who cons 100 people in a day..
.. you want to con that man.
I had always thought of you as
a sensible person, if nothing else.
Now that everything is over,
he has come to his senses.
I don't want anybody's favor.
The question of favor doesn't arise.
He wants to help you. And you..
You call this as help?
We still haven't recovered
from the wrestler's trouble.
And now he wants to bring
a travelling circus.
This is not help.
This is foolishness!
And who told him to help me?
He has already decided!
Where he wants to live,
what he wants to do..
.. where he wants to go?
Then let him do as he wishes!
There is no need to increase our..
.. and his troubles by helping us!
What has happened to you?
Me? What has happened to me?
Why did you talk to him like this?
I will talk to him the way I want!
I have lost my land!
My house has not being built!
I had to go to the prison! Now you will
teach me how to talk?
You always misunderstand him.
I don't care what he means to say!
Now you listen to me!
I have decided that I don't want
that land!
I don't want it! I don't want it!
That's it!
The matter is over! Understood!
There is no harm in listening to
what he is saying.
Mr. Sahani, there is no harm to me.
He will be harmed.
The whole of his childhood he studied
and reached to this level.
Now he wants to go to America.
And look what is going on in his mind.
I lost my plot. Fine, I have forgotten it.
But I can't endure to see his career
being ruined.
His career is not being ruined.
Yes, Mr. Sahani.
If a professional is caught doing
such a thing..
.. then he has to carry the stigma
for the rest of his life.
What's stigma! What's wrong in recovering
what belongs to you?
And nowadays nobody think
about such things.
Everybody is concerned about
themselves.
Mr. Sahani, he doesn't know how
these people are. I know.
Mr. Khosla, the whole life you grieved
that your son..
.. doesn't support you in your good
and bad times.
When he's extending support now
why are you suspecting his intention?
What has to happen, it will happen
in front of you.
Just wait and watch. But let him try.
Papa, he is Bapu. He is Asif. Asif Iqbal.
And this is Meghna. - Greetings.
You are with Khurana?
Yes. - Then..
Papa, even he had a plot like us.
And you? Sir, you.. at this age too
you are listening to them?
There is no age to pay heed
to your children, Mr. Khosala.
And you.. why are you doing
so much for us?
I.. I.. -What?
I.. uncle.. I mean..
Papa.. she is my friend. - Thanks.
I've been to the prison once.
I don't have the strength to go
to the prison again.
And I can't face any other hardship
in my house.
The rest is up to you.
No matter what papa says.
But listen to one thing.
Before doing anything arrange for..
.. a shack in Rishikesh for
papa and me.
So that if the police comes,
then we will have a hideout.
You want some tea? - No. Just
some water please.
The plot owner should look like
an affluent man.
And somebody who can't be traced.
NRl type.
America.
Canada. Australia!
Dubai!
Dubai!
Wow, Buntu! Not bad!
Don't people have beard in Dubai?
They do. But you don't have one.
- Why?
Because you look smarter like this.
Now shut up and shave
What are you doing?
We need to hire a luxurious car.. and a driver.
I'll arrange for it.
And his name will be.. Sethi. NRl Sethi.
He has come from Dubai.
He is staying in a 5 star hotel.
He has 2 mobile phones.
But that number can be traced.
We'll get 2 SIM cards from Dubai.
If we called anybody, then
the number of that place will be flashed.
Brilliant!
I know guys there. But why two?
Such a big party doesn't talk to
a person directly.
He tells others. We need a secretary!
Am I right, ma'am?
Bapu, there was a call from Bangalore.
They need 2 more shows.
And that Govind's mother is still not well.
So I have fixed Kishore.
I still haven't spoken to the hotel guys.
What?
We have got a nice role for you.
Will you do it?
The costumes have arrived.
Mercedes is also there.
Now its up to you and Bapu, Mani.
I will handle it. Don't worry.
Thanks.
What thanks? If not for Bapu,
then I would have been..
.. selling eggs at Mughalsarai station.
Come on. This is better.
If you want to trap the big fish..
then first trap the small fish.
The big fish will come on it's own.
What do you mean? -Vijayander.
Sir, you have called at the right place.
Yes, sir. You don't worry.
There will be a queue of buyers, sir.
Sir, I am a genuine party.
Yes! What?
Party, sir? Yes, sir.
Sir, the party will come. Yes, sir.
Whenever you want! No, no, sir!
Okay, sir! Okay!
"Something is happening. "
"Something is happening. "
"Something is happening. "
"Day! Day! Day! Day. "
"Something is happening. "
Remember.. broker.. party. Broker.. party.
Its 10:10! Go! - Mobile!
"Something is going on. "
What if it rings? -Who knows the number?
Have you seen the clock?
He is waiting. Let's go.
Let's go! Come on!
All the best.
You are looking perfect.
You are looking perfect.
Don't feel nervous.
You have performed such great roles
and this NRl Sethi..
.. it's nothing, sir.
It's nothing!
I am feeling so nervous.
Then let's go back. - Okay.
You have won 135 awards.
Good morning, sir! - Good morning.
At least say good morning.
No problem. He is sitting there. Go! Go!
Hello, sir. I am Vijayander Kumar.
I was talking to you only.
Welcome to India, sir.
Sir, come. Have a seat.
Are you the broker or the party?
Sir, at least have a seat.
Are you the broker or the party?
Sri, we will talk about that later.
What am I asking you!
Are you the broker or the party?
Sir, I am the broker.
What did I tell you?
I don't want to talk to a broker.
Didn't I tell you?
Sir, he was supposed to come with the party.
Sir, hear me out.
You want me to lose my job?
Call me if you find a buyer by evening.
Otherwise get lost!
Bapu, you were terrific!
Don't look back! Don't look back!
Do you have a handkerchief?
Don't wipe now. He is still there.
Bapu was fantastic!
The style he used to
turn around and walk..
.. I felt as if Vijayander
will get a heart attack.
I don't know about him.
But I surely was going to get one.
Shut up!
I think I overdone it. Now he won't call.
Even his father will call.
If he has reached to his father.
How many acres he said? - 9.
On the highway? -Yes.
Sir, if what he is saying is true..
.. then the rates will double up
after the highway is built.
It will triple.
Who is the party?
Party.. forget the party.
For you I am the party.
You will become the party for us? Fool!
Look, he is an NRl party.
He has come from Dubai.
He wants to sell it quickly and return.
That's why I was saying this.
How much do you want?
Look.. look, sir.. according to me..
.. it will be a deal of at least 1-1.5 crores.
So even I will earn some money.
Nowadays you have started
demanding too much. Fool!
What is this? - Cherry has ordered it.
He was saying there are
many people in the house.
So don't cook.
Shall I cook some vegetable for you?
Let it be.
Now will the food not be cooked..
.. in the house because of them!
And what are they doing?
- They are working hard.
They are booking for a room in a
A room in a 5 star hotel!
Are they their relatives?
Or these actors have put up
a set for them too?
Who will pay for it?
Cherry. - He has gone mad!
It's futile to splurge money on something..
.. that we have already lost!
How much have they spent?
Bunty was saying around 15,000-20,000.
Tell him to stop this madness!
It's futile to splurge money on something..
.. that we have already lost!
Tell him that!
Why don't you yourself tell him?
Me? Why should I tell him?
Let him splurge!
It's his money. Let him splurge!
It's none of my business.
Then why are you worried?
I.. I.. this..
Do you have some chutney?
When I reached home I saw it
was locked.
It's 9. And they haven't called.
It's only 9. It will surely come.
I can't even eat.
You mean you lived all alone?
- Yeah.
Wow!
What about your parents?
Mummy is in Kolkatta.
And daddy is in Bangalore.
I see! Your daddy must have
got transferred.
No, he lives there.
Then why does your mummy
reside in Kolkatta?
Actually they are divorced.
I'll take it. - No, aunty. I will keep it. You..
Cherry.
Mr. Khosla, come. Have a seat.
No, please. You remain seated.
One moment.
Tell me, papa.
I have heard that you have
spent 10,000-15,000.
Yes, we needed some things.
I know what you needed.
SIM card is coming from Dubai!
Hired cars! Rooms in 5 star hotel!
Papa, its okay. I am handling it.
Are you doing.. are you doing
a favour on me!
There is no need to act like a tycoon.
Stop dreaming. He is Khurana!
He is smarter than you. Nobody is
going to call you.
Papa.. - Look, Cherry. I am your father.
Even I know certain things.
No phone is going to come. I know it.
Cherry! Cherry, the call!
Cherry, the call!
Phone! Phone! Phone!
No, you take it. -You talk.
Come on!
Hello.
Yes.
Yes, yes, yes.
Bring them.. to Surya hotel. At 3 o'clock.
Yes, Mr. Sethi has a suite there.
You want to meet him alone?
No! No! No!
No, you can't meet him alone.
Look, I will fix this meeting for you.
I don't want any commission.
And don't even talk to me like this.
Understood?
Goodbye.
What?
What happened?
What?
Great!
It was great fun!
"The scene is gradually being created. "
"The twilight is getting
converted into dawn gradually. "
"The world is sleeping.
Somebody is awake. "
"Something is getting destroyed. "
"Look, look, something is happening. "
"Day! Day! Day! Day. "
"Something is happening. "
"Something is happening. "
"Something is happening. "
"Day! Day! Day! Day. "
"Something is happening. "
"Something is happening. "
"Something is happening. "
"Day! Day! Day! Day. "
They must have reached
the suite by now.
I am scared.
Forget suite, Bapu has never been
to a coffee shop.
Such a grand hotel and
a printing mistake. Look!
Look at this!
No, Bapu. I don't think it is a mistake.
Maybe it must be costing 150 bucks.
Forget it! We don't have to order for it!
We will have to order something..
.. otherwise it will look very odd.
Order the cheapest thing for me.
What's the cheapest thing?
Tea.
Listen.. I don't think they will come.
Let's go.
Bapu! Why are you shaking
your legs!
I can shake whatever I want!
It's none of your business!
Don't I have this much freedom?
Bapu, don't get nervous.
I will handle everything.
You just be in your character.
Let's do one more rehearsal.
- Okay.
Name. - M. L. Sethi.
Yeah. Where do you stay?
Noida. Afsal street, Hamza, Dubai.
Yes. Business?
Hotel! - Hotel! Hotel!
Textile! - Textile!
Software! - Software!
Sorry! Sorry!
I will handle everything! You just do
what Asif has told you.
What are you doing?
You should have gone earlier!
Welcome! Welcome! Come! Come!
He is Mr. Khurana. He is
Mr. Munjal. - Greetings.
He is Mr. Sethi's secretary.
Come. Come.
Please come.
Come! Come!
Please have a seat!
Come!
Make yourself comfortable.
Come! Come!
Shall I order something?
Nothing.
Mr. Sethi is in a conference call.
Ministry on one hand and Dubai
on the other.
Have a seat.
Here! Have the offerings.
- What is this for?
Mr. Khurana has got it.
- Is that so?
He goes to Tirupati before
making a big deal.
Great! And where does he go
after the big deal?
Mr. Mujal, what do I tell you
about Mr. Sethi?
I have already met him.
He looks just like a film star.
Hello, everybody.
Hello, sir. He is Mr. Khurana.
Hello. - Hello.
Sir, Mr. Khurana is interested
in buying your land.
Are you a party or a broker?
Sir, what are you saying?
I am not talking to you at all.
Are you a party or a broker?
Party.
Good! Good!
Then shall we come to the point?
The minister is very happy.
The deal is through.
Great, sir! Great!
So..
Sir, Khurana. -Yes. Mr. Khurana.
I talk clearly.
I come to India twice a year.
Once I go to visit Tirupati.
And once to visit Vaishnodevi.
Mr. Sethi is a great devotee
of Goddess Vaishnodevi.
He offers lakhs every year.
Wonderful!
When the Goddess calls,
then I can't stop myself.
You might find this strange.
Am I right?
No, no. Please continue.
What is there to say, Mr. Khurana?
It is a small piece of ancestral land.
I just want somebody who will
take good care of it.
But nowadays you don't find
such people..
.. who love their land.
Sir, Mr. Khurana loves land so much..
Will you take tea or something? - No.
Something cold? - No.
Then what will you take to keep quiet?
- No, no..
They are taking so much time. I am sure
something is wrong.
It's all my fault! I shouldn't
have forced Bapu!
I will call up on the cell.
No, no! We will wait.
Only land is worth to be loved.
What else is left nowadays?
Amazing! I am searching for the man..
and he is in front of me!
So shall I consider the deal as final?
Of course.
I just had..
a small request.
Tell me.
I just wanted to see the plot once.
Yes, why not.
When do you want to have a look?
Now.
Now?
Why? Any problem?
No, no.. no.. problem..
There is no problem
in having a look.
Actually.. actually sir
doesn't want to say it.
He finalizes all big deals
on Fridays.
It's the blessing of
the Goddess.
It's just a request.
Mr. Sethi, if the Goddess
doesn't give me..
.. the permission then how can I
dare to look at it?
I will come whenever you say.
But then it will be mine.
Friday! Blessing of the Goddess!
Keep quiet! He wants to see the plot!
And that is the problem.
Where will we bring the land?
Has anybody thought of that?
There is a land. -Which one?
There is one in that area.
I have saved it for my retirement.
You mean you are the owner
of such a big plot?
No.
Then how did you save it
for your retirement?
I understood! I understood!
But who is the owner?
Fish. It is the fisheries
department land.
A fish research institute was
going to be built there.
But government doesn't have
the time for humans..
.. then why will they think about
the fishes?
It has been lying vacant for 8 years.
There is nothing except a board.
But we will have to do the
make up of that land.
Make up?
So that everything in that plot
should look like ours.
The trees.. the plants.. the birds..
the luggage.. and people.
"Day! Day!"
"Count! Count!"
"Day! Day!"
"Count! Count!"
Welcome, Mr. Khurana!
How are you, Mr. Sethi?
Come, Mr. Khurana!
Did you have any problem
in finding the land?
I never have problem in
finding the plot.
This is what I have.
Have a look.
Sir, he is Insaan Singh.
He is the caretaker.
And she is his mother.
If you don't mind,
can I look around?
Yes. Why not?
No, you sit. You sit.
Yes, you sit. I will show him
around.
You go and have buttermilk.
Insaan Singh will show me
around. Fine?
Okay. - Me?
Yes, you. You know the plot well.
- Is that so?
Yes. Now go.
Go!
Go! Come, sir.
Come on, Satan Singh!
- Sir, Insaan Singh.
Okay.
How long have you been here?
- Since the morning.
What?
I mean since years.
But I arrived this morning.
Tell me about the plot.
What should I tell you..
about the plot, sir?
It's a big plot. There are stones..
trees.. mud.. temple.
Temple? Where is the temple?
Temple.. it's far away, sir.
its' a big plot.
Then why is he selling it?
Why he wants to sell it?
That is what we don't know, sir.
Why he wants to sell it?
It's such a lovely plot of land.
It's his land. He wants to sell it.
Why are you concerned?
Greetings. They are Mr. Sethi's men.
Okay! Let's move!
Who named you Satan Singh?
No, sir. My name is Insaan Singh.
You forgot your name? -What?
They were calling you
Satan Singh.
No, sir. I am Insaan  Singh.
I know you are a human. But why is
your name Satan Singh?
Sir, what can I say?
It's a good name.
Katori! - Oh God!
How are you?
Greetings, sir! - Greetings.
Katori, is everything well?
- Sir, it is going on.
You hardly come here nowadays.
Just like that. Sir, come.
She comes to cut the grass, sir.
She takes more than what she works.
Let her do it! Go on! Take
as much as you want.
Okay, sir. Scoundrel!
Sir, you have seen everything.
Nothing else..
Yes! Sir, there is a well!
You want to take a bath?
This man is mad!
Sir, what happened?
You want to take a bath?
Come. Let's go.
Sir, buttermilk.
Sir, have it. Buttermilk.
How is it?
Mr. Sethi, it is the business's norm.
You shouldn't praise a thing
before buying it.
You didn't tell me that you have
built a Goddess temple.
Who am I to build a Goddess temple?
Where Goddess wills, the temple
is made there.
We just pile up the bricks.
Nothing else.
Mr. Sethi, I want to sit with you some day.
First give me the land.
It's all yours. It's just a burden for me.
Then I will shed your burden.
Let's have a look at the paper.
Papers? - It's just a formality.
But we have to do it.
Mr. Khurana is very strict
about these things.
Then when?
Whenever you want.
I will call you.
Mr. Sethi, permit me to leave.
Come on!
Sir, be careful.
Sir, the lady is greeting you.
Papa.. here are the papers.
Oh God!
Power cut!
Where is the torch?
Where did you get this document?
Papa, somehow we got it.
Just think that all the people
who have worked for Khurana..
.. for so many years, a gift to
Khurana on their behalf.
Even Khurana's father can't find
a mistake in this.
You are great! Make me your student!
No need for that. Now tell me the truth.
Where did you get the papers?
Papa, I am telling you.
Mr. Khosla, if I told you the truth..
.. then you won't allow us
to use this paper.
And if we don't use it, then Khurana
will never buy the land.
And if he doesn't buy the land,
then you won't get the plot back.
Now you decide. You want
the truth or the plot?
Plot.
Mr. Khosla, the iron is hot..
and this is the hammer.
Hit it.
Mr. Sethi.. only I can make
such authentic papers.
I hope its not forged.
Sir, what are you saying?
Will Mr. Sethi give you fake papers?
No, no. Even if it's fake,
then we will make it authentic.
You tell me. What's the price?
Tell me, Mr. Sethi.
Whatever you think is fair.
No, no. You must be
expecting something.
No, no. I don't have
any expectations.
Still. - 1.5.
No. 1.5 is too much. Reduce it a bit.
Think something about us too.
A bit. - 1.25.
Okay. - 1.35.
No, no..
Okay. Mr. Sethi.
What will I bargain with you?
Neither mine, nor yours.
Half in cash.
No problem.
So, Mr. Sethi.
This is the advance.
It's 35 lakhs.
The rest after getting the land.
Count it.
No, please count it.
No, I will make a move.
No, I have to go.
Mr. Sethi, at least take the cash.
I will leave.
Mr. Sethi! Mr. Sethi!
Mr. Sethi! Mr. Sethi!
You didn't bring the money? -Why?
Why are you asking me? Ask him.
Him? What to ask him?
What have you done!
You spoiled a finalized deal!
Papa, what the hell!
we still had 23 lakhs.
Cash! The man who has not seen 35 rupees..
.. you are telling him to bring 35 lakhs in cash!
Aren't you all ashamed!
Papa, what are you saying?
Hang on! Hang on!
Have this.
You want more?
No. Thanks.
Mr. Khosla, I am very sorry.
What you have done..
nobody would have done even that.
You are blaming him for ruining it!
If he had not taken so much trouble..
.. then we couldn't have even achieved that.
What are you saying!
The plan has been sabotaged!
What plan? Phoney land..
phoney papers.. everything phoney!
Is this what you all have learned
in this house?
Papa, even Khurana uses phoney papers..
I don't care what Khurana does!
But I am not Khurana! Do you understand!
I am not Khurana!
Calm down. - I am fine!
Had I been in his place, then I would have done..
.. exactly what he did!
This is called decency!
If you remember this word!
Or else even you have become..
.. like those who called me uncle and..
Please end this now. End it.
Tell him to fill his visa form tomorrow.
Khurana!
Hello. Yes. Yes.
Yes! No! What?
Okay. Okay.
Okay.
It was Khurana's secretary's call.
He said that after Mr. Sethi left..
.. then we realized that maybe
we have offered very less money.
Khurana is ready to give 1 crore 40 lakhs.
Whatever Bapu does, it is right!
Hang on! Hang on! Hang on!
But he wants to pay the advance on the plot.
He wants to see the plot again.
On the plot. It means again..
Everybody has gone to Bangalore.
Only Ghanshyam-ji is here.
Another theatre crew?
No! No!
It is not safe to take any outsider.
Apart from Ghanshyam
we need 3 labourers.. another one..
.. an old lady.. she is inside the house..
.. so we need at least 5 people.
If anything is changed drastically..
.. then Khurana will come to know.
So whatever we have to do,
we have to do it amongst ourselves.
Papa.. please give us the permission.
It is our last chance.
Bapu, it's a last chance.
Mr. Sethi! - Mr. Khurana!
Sir, I made a mistake. - No, no.
Forgive me.
No, no. It is my fault.
- No. It's my fault. It's my fault.
No, no. - Sir, it's my fault.
If you found the offer less,
then you should have said.
It's okay. It's okay.
That Satan Singh is nowhere to be seen.
Satan Singh!
Insaan Singh!
Insaan Singh!
Insaan Singh!
Greetings. Actually my mother is not well.
She has given her greetings from inside.
I had one wish.
Before the deal, I wanted to
visit the temple with you once.
Let's go. -What are you saying?
I am not saying. He is saying it.
He is saying it, but you too understand.
You are not saying anything.
Is there a problem?
Tell me.
Actually Mr. Sethi had a
omelette in the morning.
So he can't visit the temple
after eating non-vegetarian.
That too on a great day like today.
Forget it. The land is now mine.
We will go anytime.
You get that buttermilk ready.
I will have a round with Insaan Singh.
I will also come.
Why are you taking the trouble?
I have already troubled you so much.
Come, Mr. Satan.
Come.
Satan Singh!
I can't see that girl.
Sir, who? - That..
Greetings. Greetings. - Greetings.
Papa, turn your face.
Vijayander is nowhere to be seen.
That is better. Fool!
What happened to the lady? -Who?
That lady.. Insaan Singh's mother.
Old age! - Old age!
What's her name?
Chamchi..
Katori? - Katori!
She has gone to her village.
Her father expired!
Will she come back? -Yes, why?
Nothing.
If you have some work, then tell me, sir.
Imarti is there.
Imarti?
Imarti!
What happened?
She is her younger sister, sir.
She is very insolent!
She has just returned from the village.
When she will come,
then she will go back.
Can't both of them stay?
- Both? Why, sir?
Nothing. Let's go.
Scoundrel!
Sri.. we have reached the well too.
Sir, you want to take a bath?
Is there water problem here?
- Problem? No, sir. Why?
Let's go. Come on! - Okay.
It's cash in advance.
Sir, buttermilk.
I don't want buttermilk today.
Today we will celebrate.
Sir, I desire to sit with you.
Let's go to the farmhouse.
We will have a drink.
Sir, today is Friday. You can't drink.
He had omelette. Explain to him.
You are always objecting!
Last time too you left suddenly.
Sir, take the money. Mujal, take this.
Yes, sir. Whether you take the money here or..
.. in the farmhouse, it is one and the same thing.
No! No! - Come, sir!
Sir, listen!
He had egg by mistake.
He can't drink knowingly.
Sir, today is Friday!
Some other day! Sir!
Oh God!
Get the Mercedes! Come on!
What the hell are they doing?
I don't know. - Oh God!
Let's follow them!
Bunty, go home with the others!
Wait for my call! Let's go, Asif!
Dear, you haven't eaten anything since morning.
You were out since 6. Shall I make something?
No, aunty.
We should have taken the money that day.
That Khurana is a cunning man.
I don't know what he is up to.
I understood on the first day itself..
.. that you are not what you look like.
Sir, it's very late.
Keep quiet!
Sir, your staff is so strange!
There too he was asking me to take a bath.
What is this? What is this?
And he has an objection
to each and everything.
That day.. when you got up and went away..
.. sir, I knew that you are great.
Really! What is the value
of the land for you?
Zero! Nothing! Zero!
Even if I were to take the money back..
.. it won't make a difference to you.
What is 35 lakhs!
Mr. Sethi.. you sold the land..
I bought it. Am I right?
Sir..
I know it's late. Keep quiet!
Eat something!
I'm very impressed! I'm very impressed!
Sir, do you know what my problem is?
I still goof up. Sir, it's because of
keeping low class company.
And your secretary..
the way the talks to me..
.. I don't even talk to myself in that way.
No, no. Very good! - Thank you, sir.
Sir, partnership. Partnership!
Partnership, Mr. Sethi! Partnership!
Hey! What is there in these pennies!
What is there?
Mr. Sethi.. you keep on sending me
money from Dubai.
And I will keep on buying properties here.
Fine? Secretary!
Then wait and watch what we do!
Shopping complex..
housing complex.. multiplexes..
.. going carting.. and what's that?
Bowling. -We will do everything. Fine?
And you guys are coming tomorrow.
Mr. Sethi! For lunch!
Then we will talk tomorrow!
Okay! Goodnight! Goodnight!
Sir, cash.
Very good! Very good! Very decent!
No, I appreciate. - Sir, cash. Cash.
Thank you.
Tomorrow. Goodnight!
Hey! Go straight and take a right turn.
Come on. Be careful. Carefully.
Mr. Sethi.. goodnight.
I will just come. - Sir! Sir! Sir!
Are they coming properly?
Yes, they are coming.
Come on. Increase the speed.
Asif-bhai. -Yes.
Thank you.
What are you saying, Cherry-bhai!
Hail to the Goddess!
Hail to the Goddess!
What is this?
What do you think?
Did you check it?
Can I get water?
Did you check it? -Yes.
Not here. Let's go inside.
Papa.
We got the money.
Get the plot back tomorrow.
You too come along.
Now I can't do all this alone.
Keep this in the safe.
"What is love?"
"What is it not?"
"I didn't ask. "
"Are you mine or not. "
Hi. - Hi.
Where were you? - I was changing.
We got the money.
I know. Okay. I have to go.
Shall I escort you?
- No, I have the scooter. Bye.
Meghna!
Mr. Khosla, you are great! Take this.
Very good! Very good!
Is he your other son? -Yes.
What does he do?
He's a software engineer.
Excellent! Very good! Very good!
You are lucky. You have 2 sons.
One is angry son
and the other one wears specs.
We want to vacate the plot.
Tell Ombirto evacuate.
The plot is vacant, sir.
Ombir is here, sir.
Excellent! The plot is vacate!
Goodbye then.
At least have sweets.
You have got the plot back.
No! No! - For my sake! Please!
No, no. Please, Mr. Khurana. I don't want it.
Papa! Papa, are you okay?
- I am fine.
Are you sure?
- I was feeling giddy. I am okay.
I am okay.
Have you thought of a name?
- What?
You wanted to change your name, didn't you?
You didn't get the time.
So when are you leaving?
Where?
America. Where else?
I don't know.
It has been a long time
since I spoke to them.
Anyway they were not paying well.
She's a nice girl. -Who?
Meghna. She is a nice girl.
Hi. - Hi.
Meghna.. I am not going to New York.
Meghna, I am not going to New York.
Are you doing a favour on me? - Meghna.
Today you are not going.
You will go tomorrow.
You are not going day after tomorrow.
It is not a joke to you.
No Meghna! I want to stay here.
I need you!
Just don't say anything!
I love you, Meghna!- Shut up!
Meghna! I am sorry!
"The night is so short. "
"There are so many things to be said. "
"Now that you have come. "
"I will tell you everything. "
"Please hold me just once. "
"Please hold me just once. "
"The wait.. the faith.. "
"I love you too so much. "
"The wait.. the faith.. "
"I love you too so much. "
"The wait.. the faith.. "
"I love you too so much. "
"The wait.. the faith.. "
"I love you too so much. "
Okay now one minute, let us be serious.
One minute!
After giving Khurana 10 lakhs
we have 25 left with us.
Out of that the expenses
were around 1 lakh.
So now what do we do with the rest?
I do not know anything about it.
You don't ask me
anything about the money.
So if we divide this money
into three parts then..
.. Aasif brother you will get 8 lakhs.
Thank you! - No, thank you!
And Bapu, for your theatre group, 8 lakhs.
No! Ten lakhs!
Hey no! - Not for you,
you smoke your beedi.
Our theatre company does not run on water.
A little money will always be of help to us.
Papu, he is right!
Now remain our 8 lakhs.
What are we supposed to do with that?
Sir, the hotel is saying..
that no Sethi ever came there from Dubai.
Phone.
It's Dubai's cash card number.
The plot.
It belongs to the fisheries board.
Just forget what happened.
This matter should not be leaked out.
That somebody fooled Khurana.
Now you all do it properly please.
