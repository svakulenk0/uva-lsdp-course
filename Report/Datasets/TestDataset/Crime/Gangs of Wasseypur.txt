There are two kinds of human
One form is Clever and second form is stupid
And this game is based upon these two kind of humans
Now when some clever human started foolish things
and when some fool has become a part of cleverness
You never find out
This Wasseypur's story is strange
lf you will see from outside
then Wasseypur is the village of decent men
but when you enter inside...
then there are lot of bastards are hidden inside...
Now what they have been proved
in the end that's another thing.
at least they all think themselves Clever in their lives...
We muslim's battle is not today's war.
it has been running since centuries...
And in Wasseypur this fight was
not between Shia and Sunni.
All of them were Sunni
This fight was between Qureshis and other muslims...
lt has announced war later
earlier it was one sided attacks...
Qureshi were butchers...
and Everyone was scared from Butchers.
They scared the people...
Now Qureshis were ruling in Wasseypur.
When this village was outside the Dhanbad.
and then Dhanbad become a part of Bengal.
After freedom Dhanbad went to Bihar
and Wasseypur has become a part of Dhanbad
Now Dhanbad is in Jharkandh
And Wasseypur is in the centre of Dhanbad
Anyway!
Story is still running
But it was started
when around Dhanbad...
British has occupied all the harvests
and started coal business
when trains runs with coal...
and all factories and machines runs with coal
When Sultana dacoit used to live here...
and he robbed their trains
That man attacked on british
trains and robbed their treasures
One day force were travelling
in train instead of treasure
when Sultana attacked on the train
British has arrested him and
sentenced them life imprisonment.
Mulla told me that British gave him death sentence
Shut up!
- Yes.
Your Moulvi is a stupid man
Actually Sultana was Qureshi
And in history, he was the second man..
..that escaped from the life imprisonment.
Was he Sultana?
- Yes.
He is alive?
- Yes.
He is in Wasseypur.
and british is still looking for him..
..and he's still robbing their trains
C'mon!
Get in!
We have removed the tracks
lf you will drive lt then you will be stuck
There is nothing ln train but food bags
We are also businessmen
We are not dacoits who came to rob the money
We have quit rob the treasure...
Now Sultana robs the food bags
May l go?
You have train.
and l have bull cart.
So until l don't return and ask you to leave..
..till then sit here...
Sit down!
Sit down!
Quick! Hurry up!
Be quick! C'mon!
Fast!
Where is the car?
- l don't know
Open the box l will check...
- Okay.
Why did you stop the train?
Train is empty
Why all boxes are empty?
Sultana dacoit came...
he robbed all the food...
There is someone who is robbing the train with my name
Who could he be?
Who?
Shahid Khan!
He is only person who have horse
Salutation!
- Salutation!
But his horse used for commercial purpose
lt was...
..but now he sell food...
How is your business?
Entire market is finished...
He is selling the food in cheap prices
lf we will try to fight So we will be finish...
And Shahid!
When your younger brother will come?
He should have come in 2 months
Rest is upto God.
Allah!
Train track passes from the Qureshi neighbourhood
only qureshi lives both side of the track
So Qureshi have right on every train
..nor any pathan.
Look!
l just want to tell you one thing
Whatever you do..
..but don't do blood bath.
Shahid is also belongs to this Wasseypur
But he doesn't belongs to our caste...
lf we will be caught so we appologize to Mukhtar Sahab
He won't kill us
lf he will kill us then...
He won't do it
l know him
Dog never change it's breed
lf you don't beat the horse so he never run
Shahid was stubborn like that
His life was in danger
Everyone knew that who is robbing the trains...
But how do he listen to anyone
Robbing was in our blood.
Thought dark clouds were raising..
..it had to rain.
Are you scared?
Do you know who is Shareef Qureshi?
You are using his name
Sultana dacoit died in black water
and the rest are stories...
He is butcher - So what will he do?
We pathans keep thousand butchers in our houses
They are weak like their goats
And tomorrow l will remove the train from the tracks
Hit it hard.
lt's not coming out.
Here they come!
Run for your lives
Let's go.
Don't spare anyone alive.
Let everyone know.
How are you feeling?
Better.
- Lie down!
Chief!
Where is everyone?
Only l'm alive
They have killed all of them
You said that they won't do anything
tell him to leave Wasseypur with his family
We will go...
but ask him how l will feed them
and by the way what have l done with him
You're using my name to rob trains.
Tell him to leave.
One food bag
will reach to your home from every train
Okay.. okay.
Don't give him any food bag
Shahid khan must Escaped for his life.
but he was not a coward
He knew that Qureshi
won't spare him
We settled down in Dhanbad.
We settled down in Dhanbad.
Shahid's wife gave him his kid's swear
that he will quit his bad habits
and he will find a job.
Bear a little pain.
Bear it, my dear.
Bear it!
Call her husband.
Please stop the work
Water is pouring inside...
Everyone will sink down
- Do your work!
Even 9 hours are not completed from 12 hours job
Everyone will sink down...
Nobody else is asking for me
Then why you have a problem
Get lost!
Go back to your work.
Excuse me!
What?
Shahid Khan!
His baby is stuck in his wife's womb
So?
Please give him news.
lt's important.
No need of it, Get lost from here
Nobody will stop the work before 12 hours
lf anyone will stop the work
then l will remove his skin and hang him to butcher market
What are you doing?
Please, Shahid Khan's
wife is serious.
Please give this news to him.
What are you blabbering?

lt's been 6 hours but kid is not coming out

- l was coming but...
he pushed me away
Why didn't you tell me?
She's dead.
She had heavy bleeding.
She was in great pain.
She gave birth to a cute son.
Take care.
We can't blame God
for life and death
We gave life with our wish and sometimes by mistake
but people died from our mistake
lt wasn't that Pehelwan's mistake
who didn't let me come
lt was my mistake
that l defeated from that Pehelwan
And l have to suffer the punishment of my weakness
Shahid Khan will kill our man
Who Shahid Khan?
Hit him!
Hit him!
Hit him!
When the world..
..will sleep,
At the stroke of the midnight hour..
lndia will awake to life.
The real war began after the freedom.
After British left, all the mines..
..were distributed to Tata,
Birla and Thapa.
But there were very few who understand business.
And Ramadhir benefited the most by this decision.
He became a big head.
And few mines were handed over to him.
But without the labours, neither British..
..nor these businessmen could run the mines.
And also not Ramadhir.
- Will you work for me?
l'm already in your service.
Will you be my special worker?
You won't lack anything in life.
Yes. - Now, l've got the contract of these mines.
All the coals produced here will be mine.
Profit and loss, everything is mine.
After the British,
now the labours think that..
..the workload will reduce and they'll get more wages.
But it's not true.
We've to increase the production.
For which we need more coal.
We've to dig it more.
We've to dig a new mine..
..on the place where the labours live.
Get lost!
British had money.
So they provided salary as well as shelter.
We're not that capable.
We'll pay them by which they can
arrange their shelter on their own.
What happened?
Why aren't you working?
Sir, we've been met with injustice.
Our houses are set on fire.
We've families.
l'm going inside for refreshment.
l shouldn't see anyone here when l come out.
C'mon, get back to your work!
Get lost! Join your duty.
But you're one of us.
Get lost!
C'mon!
Do you want an invitation? C'mon.
Shahid! - Yes.
You think..
..you're treating your friends correctly?
No one is a friend here.
British had left a piece of bread.
And monkeys came later.
And what do you think?
Ramadahir Singh's father had left the mines for him?
Earlier British owned it..
..and now Ramadhir Singh.
And in future, l'll own the mines by killing Ramadhir Singh.
Shahid Khan!
l'll see!
Yes!
Sir is calling him.
He's in the jeep.
Yes, l'll send him.
Ramadhir Singh is waiting
for you in the jeep.
Why is he here?
lt's very precious goods.
lt has to reach Benaras this night.
Benaras?
Atrain will leave from Dhanbad station after 20 minutes.
l've got your ticket.
Let's go.
l didn't inform my son,
he'll wait for me.
l'll send a message.
Let's go to sleep.
Whose umbrella it is?
lt was lying here.
Really? Show me.
Ramadhir Singh?
Escaped!
And the child? - He's killed.
And the dead body?
l buried its pieces.
Mr Yadav? Shahid Khan.
Mr Ramadhir..
..has sent money.
lt's pistol, right?
Will you show me?
Running and rattling..
..playing with the rocks..
changing it's side every now and
then, what's made of water drops?
That has four letter name?
Ganga!
Shahid Khan didn't return.
We knew he will never.
Sardar grew up with my nephew Asgar.
One day he asked me..
..about Shahid Khan.
l told him that Ramadhir Singh had
taken away his father and killed him.
After that Sardar's childhood ended.
He started thinking
about Ramadhir only.
Since then he took an oath..
..that he won't grow hairs on his head..
..until he'd avenge his father's death.
C'mon, anyone for Girdi..
Jaliya.
Dhanbad! Ranchi! Wassypur!
Will you come?
- No.
C'mon, anyone for Girdi?
Girdi! Jaliya! Ranchi!
Dhanbad!
Girdi!
Jariya! Dhanbad! Wassypur!
Girdi! Ranchi! Dhanbad! Wassypur!
Girdi!
Saradar Khan, son of Shahid Khan..
..your marriage with Ms Nagma, daughter of lmtiyaz Ahmed..
..has been fixed keeping all the terms.
Do you accept this marriage?
Yes! l do...
Do you accept this marriage?
- Yes! l do...
Do you accept this marriage?
Do you accept this marriage?
Do you want water?
Sardar!
Coming!
Let's vacate them.
He killed my father
My father sat in his car and gone with him
he never came back
l have only object in my life
Revenge!
l can't see Ramdheer Singh's progress
l have to finish that bastard
l won't shoot him
l will make fun of him
l will show him his value
Slowly, slowly l will snatch
everything from him so he will die..
Respectable Mr Ramadhir Singh.
Long live!
Long live!
Long live!
l am standing on this stage and promise you
that we'll defeat the opposition.
ln 1952 when Jagjivan Raam was announced Minister
To change the situation of that time.
so he announced..
..Coal Welfare Association to see labour's condition
as per that National Trade Union has been established
As per that Supervisors
pressurized Coal Mines Owners
and Ramadheer Singh was the Leader of that movement
This trade union has become a face of Mafia.
Union Leader has become contractors
and they were raising funds to make other labours to their workers
They gave money on interest
and they keep their salaries for interest
What will l eat from this?
New contractors came one by one
Ramadhir singh was already a contractor.
He has become a politician
and won the election, too.
My dad run coal mines for many years
His name is Ramadhir Singh.
l know how..
..how contractors and labours..
..stealing coal and sell in black markets
l won't let this
black marketing happen
My profit should be great
Coal is a great thing
lt looks like stone
but it's not thick like stone
it's light weighted
if you will put it into the water
Now it will soak the water.
And it will become..
Heavy
ls it?
Yes. - Come in.
After this privatization..
you are facing many injustices
Our union...
Union for labours.
lt's lending us money and taking our salaries as interests.
And how it's happening
lts all happening under Chief...
Stop, where are you going?
l have told you
that my share should be same like other contractors
l am sending the stuff as per your demand
lt's going...
..but it's not reaching there.
Until S.P. Sinha will alive
till then nor we will eat something
neither we will have house.
What do you think?
S.P. Sinha isjust educated.
He is writing in his office.
How do he know how people are stealing.
We don't have food to eat.
And he is gardening outside his house.
You shouldn't break the flower
Just play with it. okay?
Hey, Ramadhir!
Catch him!
With privatization, government
took the mines back from Ramadhir..
..and handed over to Coal lndia..
..which was under S.P. Sinha.
Ramadher Singh has become contractor from Owner.
And after killing S.P. Sinha
Ramadheer's terror has increased..
..which made him a first don of Dhanbad.
Your father was a big man.
Move.
Where is Sardar Khan?
Sardar khan came here
Sardar Khan!
ln the opposite room.
Who's it?
What do you mean?
She says that she is Nagma.
She said she is Nagma?
And you too think she is Nagma.
What do you think of me?
l didn't found out
Didn't you think of anything before doing this?
Were you walking in sleep?
Seriously. l couldn't realize.
She took advantage of me.
No..
What are you doing? She will die
Let her die
There'll be a murder. - Move.
Leave it. She'll get hurt.
l said move, or else l'll kill you.
Listen to me.
l won't spare you alive
Leave it.
Nagma!
Stop!
Where are you running?
Some day you will come home.
Rogue!
No..
Calm down!
Have patience.
Push!
Get lost!
My son!
My child!
Smile!
Smile for me!
Smile for me!
Smile for me!
Take him!
My child!
My prince!
My child!
Please forgive me
What is it?
- l don't know.
What is it?
Just there's something.
Nothing could happen right now
Why?
Somebody is inside my womb.
So, l am not taking him out.
Don't you feel shame?
You will make your kid dirty?
This is not right...
When somebody is already inside
So you should control your self
You're right.
l'm tired of telling him.
He is born evil.
There has to be a
lone horse amongst mare.
When Darish was to be born..
..nine months passed away.
Even after his birth, one month passed just like that.
And now she's carrying again.
C'mon, the food is ready.
Coming.
What do we do?
Should we live life or not?
We too have lived that way.
Wonder how you lived.
You want to quench your thirst..
..you can go anywhere you want.
Don't bring anyone home.
Otherwise, l'll kill her.
And wherever you go, take a bath before you leave.
Who's going out?
Eat your food.
You'll get power.
Don't bring me shame outside.

That's it.
Where have you brought me?
Someone is..
..illegally capturing the land.
Who?
Who's he?
Sardar Khan!
Who's he?
The one who drives Asgar's jeep at the station.
He drops our passengers.
From when did he get that power?
Call him to my office.
He won't come.
Why?

But he said you must come to him

Ramadhir Singh didn't recognize Sardar
Perhaps not me,
Besides he saw me with Shahid.
But if he wished, he'd recognize me.
lt was a time...
..when big people forget their names
..but they never forget their land...
Where it's written that this land is yours?

But he didn't know, what couldn't
