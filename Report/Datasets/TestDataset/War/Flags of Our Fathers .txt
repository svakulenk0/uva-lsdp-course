Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
For God sakes! Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Honey, what's wrong?
Where is he?
Where is he?
Where... Where is he? Where is he?
Mr. Bradley?
Mr. B? You okay?
-Where is he?
-Where is who?
Where is he? Where did he go?
Where... Where is he?
All right. Just stay right here, okay?
I'm gonna call an ambulance.
It'll be okay.
Where is he?
They died without glory.
Nobody has taken their pictures.
Only their buddies knew what they did.
I'd tell their folks
they died for their country.
I'm not sure that was it.
Now, there were plenty other photos
taken that day,
but none anybody wanted to see.
What we see and do in war,
the cruelty, is unbelievable.
But somehow
we gotta make some sense of it.
To do that,
we need a easy to understand truth
and damn few words.
Film's ruined.
I don't know. This one looks all right.
You're gonna want to see this.
Look at Vietnam.
The picture of that
South Vietnamese officer
blowing that fella's brains
out of the side of his head, whammo!
That was it.
The war was lost.
We just hung around
trying to pretend it wasn't.
Thanks. Appreciate it.
Oh, my Lord, that's Harlon!
Where?
Right there.
Planting that flag, that's your brother.
Ma, all you can see is his behind.
And that's his. I powdered
and diapered it, I know my son.
That's him. Go get your father.
Daddy, Ma's got a picture
of Harlon's keister in the paper.
You watch your mouth, young man.
Thank you.
It's on the front page
of every major paper.
Over 200 dailies and they're
all flooded with requests for prints.
I think we might have found it.
Corpsman!
-I gotta go get him.
-Oh, no, you don't.
Iggy, I gotta go.
I have a whole different theory.
He wants medical attention bad enough,
he'll come to us.
Shut up and crawl over here,
you lazy son-of-a-bitch!
As soon as that flare goes out.
-Crap. Okay, well, I'll go with you.
-No.
You're actually gonna leave me here?
I'll be right back,
just shoot some people. I gotta go.
Oh, God.
Okay, it's okay.
Don't touch them. Don't touch them.
Get your hands out of there.
Let me do that. I'll do it, okay?
Don't look. Keep your head back.
Keep your eyes on me.
All right, look at me.
I'll get it. I'll take care of it.
We'll get this bandage on you.
We'll get you taken care of.
And we'll get you down to the bottom,
all right?
Look, you're gonna be fine.
It's okay.
I'll do that. I'll do that.
Here, put some pressure on that.
Put your hands on top
and put some pressure on it.
Keep your head back. Keep breathing.
Keep looking at me, all right?
Just keep looking at...
Doc.
Help me.
Help me.
All right. Okay.
How's that feel?
-It feels good.
-It does? All right.
-Good.
-All right.
I'm gonna go get a stretcher and get
you down to the beach. I'll be right back.
I'm all right.
Go and help someone who's hurt.
All right. Hold on there.
-Where'd he go?
-Who?
The guy who was right here, Ignatowski.
Where did he go?
-I think you jumped in the wrong hole.
-I didn't jump in the wrong hole!
He was right here,
now where the hell is he?
lggy!
lggy!
You shut up. You want every Jap
on the island shooting at us?
lggy!
Holy shit.
They expect us to climb this?
Or something just like it.
So, where you think they're sending us?
I think it's the desert, Franklin.
Well, that makes no sense at all.
Well, it's just military psychology.
They always train you for the desert
on a volcano.
Now you're just having fun with me.
Harlon, take your men right.
-Watch for Bedouins.
-Yes, sir.
-What's a Bedouin?
-It's a guy with a camel.
Well, Jeez Louise,
maybe we are going to the desert.
Now, you tilt that to the right, but
what if the bullet comes from the left?
Bullets don't come from the left.
You know any left-handed Japs?
That makes about as much sense
as you showering with your shoes on.
You don't even know why you do it,
do you?
'Cause I don't tell you
mean I don't know?
You do it 'cause Mike does it.
I'll ask him.
So you cut hair back home?
Some.
Training to be a barber, are you, Doc?
No, I just studied it a little.
But not in barber school?
Nope.
-Gosh.
-Let me guess, Hayes is winning.
Chief, I had very little to do
with Sitting Bull's death,
so maybe you could stop
taking it out on me.
Different tribe. The Pimas fought
on the side of the white man.
-See, now that's smart.
-That is smart.
Yeah. Worked real good for us.
Good luck, fellas.
Hey, good night, Lindberg.
Dead bodies.
He cuts hair on dead bodies.
What? Even I knew that.
-Who's in?
-Oh, I'm in. I'm in.
It must be a lot easier with them
not moving around and all.
-There's that.
-Yeah.
You know what I been thinking?
Well, they been telling us
we need to buddy up
and I think we'd make
pretty good buddies.
And how do you figure that?
Well, you know,
in that we have a lot in common.
So, why do you cut dead people's hair,
anyway?
I'm studying to work in a funeral home.
You tell a lot of people that?
You actually chose the Marines
because they got the best uniform?
No sense being a hero
if you don't look like one.
Jacks.
Queens.
Shit.
Do anything on that reservation
but play cards, Chief?
All right, listen up,
you sorry bunch of leathernecks!
We practice going
over the side tomorrow
which means we ain't long
for this piece of rock.
All right!
One more thing, any man who doesn't
have his masturbation papers in order
better get them signed by tomorrow
night or he ain't going overseas.
-I got mine already.
-Oh, yeah. I'm square.
Wait. Why am I just hearing about this?
That's horseshit, Franklin. I don't have
to repeat everything twice for you.
No, I didn't hear nothing
about no masturbating papers.
Heard they were running short.
You know, nobody tells me nothing.
That's real nice, guys.
All right, get your ass over
to the officer in charge of records.
Maybe he got some more left.
-Leave your smokes. I'll play for you.
-Thanks, Mike.
Listen, he calls you an idiot,
you take it like a man, okay?
Just do not leave without signing them.
-I appreciate it, Sergeant.
-You got it.
What the hell happened to your hair,
Rene?
Look like a goddamn corpse.
Three points of contact on that rope
at all times.
Next four. Over the side.
Let's go. Keep moving.
Next four, over the side.
Just keep your eye
on the guy below you.
That's all you gotta look at.
Watch me, Doc, just watch me.
Keep three points of contact
on the rope at all times.
You see? No big thing.
Just one step at a time and keep
your hands on the vertical rope.
Remember, once you're in the boat
move away from the rope.
Just make sure you keep three points
of contact on the rope.
I got him!
All right, get that man out of the water.
Give me a hand.
Grab his pack.
Don't worry about him, Doc.
All right, quit skylarking! Keep it moving!
He'll be fine.
Our target, Island X,
is an ugly, smelly,
dirty little scab of rock called lwo Jima.
It means "Sulfur Island,"
which accounts for the smell.
Looks sort of like a burnt pork chop,
you ask me.
After 20 straight days of bombing
you won't find a blade of grass
or a twig on it.
It wasn't that pretty to start with.
Captain?
lwo's just five-and-a-half miles long,
two-and-a-half wide.
There's a lump down at the bottom.
That's Mount Suribachi.
On the maps in front of you
the island is white.
Not much of it.
The black dots represent
known enemy emplacements.
Coastal defense guns,
dual-mount dual-purpose guns,
covered artillery emplacements.
Rifle pits, foxholes, antitank guns
machine guns, blockhouses, pillboxes,
and earth-covered structures.
I don't see any barracks
or any other structures.
That's right.
And we still don't know why.
Now, this isn't just any island to them.
This isn't Tarawa, Guam, Tinian,
or Saipan.
This is Japanese soil, sacred ground.
Twelve thousand Japanese defenders
in eight square miles.
They will not leave politely, gentlemen.
It's up to us to convince them.
The 28th will land here at Green Beach.
The 8th Ammo Company
will land here to re-supply.
The Suribachi's guns
are the biggest problem.
They can hit any point on the island.
We're sitting ducks
until we take them out.
That's our job.
We cut across the island, right at the
base, slit its throat, lop off its head.
And we take that mountain.
We take that mountain,
we take their big guns.
We take their eyes.
Yeah, boys!
Man overboard portside!
See him?
Throw me a line!
He's right there.
-Where is he?
-Watch out, watch out, watch out.
Hawaii's that way!
Just keep paddling, Mac,
we'll catch you on the way back!
Hold on, they're gonna lower a raft!
They're not gonna stop.
What?
None of them are. They can't.
So much for "No man left behind."
-Sir.
-Come on in.
Look, I've had to make
a few other changes.
I'm promoting you to platoon sergeant.
-Thank you, sir. I appreciate it.
-You bet.
Trouble is, I already told my men
I'd see them through this.
That your
James Cagney impersonation?
'Cause I've heard better.
Well, I'll keep practicing, then.
Look, this isn't
your first time through this.
-You don't need to prove anything.
-No, sir.
You're not the best sergeant
I've ever had,
you're just the best one
that's still walking.
-Block's a good man.
-Yes, sir, he is.
The men know him, he can step right in.
You know,
I have actually thought this through.
Platoon sergeant puts you further away
from the bullets.
I already gave them my word, sir.
I told them I'd bring them all home
to their mothers
which means I already lied to half
of them. Can't lie to the rest.
-How are your men?
-They'll do fine.
Except maybe Gagnon.
Our own Tyrone Power?
Yes, sir. He's a good man, just might be
better use further back from the lines.
I'll use him as a runner.
All right. Thank you, sir.
Now get out of here.
Hear the good news, Doc?
We're going in with the first waves.
Hey, you do that again
I'll take your head off!
Fucking dominoes.
Iggy, have you ever heard news
you considered to be bad?
The first ones off the ship, Doc.
Means we don't go over
the side of the ship.
We hop on a tractor,
they drive us right there.
Oh, shit, that is good news.
You see? What'd I tell you?
What's going on?
Look at that.
We're killing them!
We're killing them, Doc.
I was promised 10 days of shelling.
You're giving me three
and saying that's the best you can do?
I don't give a shit! My men hit
that beach with less than 10
and I'll be taking them home
to their mamas in buckets!
Yeah, I know exactly why.
Because every Navy man with
a scrambled egg on his chest
wants to offload us here
and sail to Japan
so they can be there for the big finish,
tell their kids they captured
the Emperor all by themselves.
Well, you aren't going to Japan
unless we take this piece of shit island!
These little pricks are dug in!
Okay, appreciate that, Jim.
Three days is a fucking beautiful thing.
Sharpen your knife or bayonet?
I'm okay.
Sharpen your knife or bayonet?
Jesus, lggy, just leave me alone,
all right?
How about you guys? Knife? Bayonet?
Kick in the ass?
How about you, Doc?
Sharpen your knife?
You sharpened it three times already.
Well, then I better make sure
I didn't nick it.
Good man, Doc.
-Hey, Doc.
-Yeah.
When we land, try not to wave
this kit around too much.
They got sharpshooters
that are trained to look for them.
And they know that
if they take out a corpsman
another dozen Marines
will die unattended. All right?
Okay, Mike.
Yeah, right there.
Close the damn door. For God's sake.
Yeah, like that's gonna help.
That your girlfriend, Chief?
Bet she's a pretty
damn good-looking squaw.
Bet you're missing her,
and that little wigwam of yours.
It's what they do to prisoners,
-at least the lucky ones.
-Jesus.
If I were you, cowpokes, I wouldn't think
about waving a white bandanna.
Gunners!
Move, let's go!
Let's go, get up on the berm!
Gunners!
We're clear!
Get up the berm!
Baker Company, move out!
-Seen Second Platoon?
-I don't see them.
First Squad, move it out!
God, this place reeks.
-Go, go, go!
-Move out!
Go, go, go, go! Go, go! Go! Go, go!
Drop your packs! Go!
All clear!
-Jesus, you needed some exercise?
-He got lost.
A hundred landing craft heading
for one beach and this guy gets lost.
Now I'm glad we did.
Jesus, what a mess.
Any theories why they ain't shooting?
It's getting on my nerves.
Maybe they're all dead.
What do you think, Doc?
You think they're all dead?
Mike, take six men
and bring that gun onto the beach.
Second Platoon, let's move out!
Stay down. Come on.
Move! Move!
-Get down!
-Take cover!
Move out!
Cover fire! Pour it on!
Ray, shift your fire to the right, now!
Corpsman!
I'm gonna sling your arm
and then I'll give you a shot for the pain!
Move, move! Off the beach!
Take cover!
You got a girl back home, Marine?
We're gonna make sure
she sees you, all right?
I need pressure on this wound!
Where's the fire coming from?
Where are they?
Look for a flash, shoot at it!
Let's go, let...
Twelve o'clock, take out the bunker!
You're over!
Third Squad, forward! Move!
Where are they, sir?
We got ten o'clock!
Ten o'clock, pillbox! Sergeant!
-Sergeant! I think I can clear that out.
-What?
All right, you go. Here.
Take these. Check your weapon.
Yeah? Go! Cover!
Cover him!
Cover, cover!
Son-of-a-bitch.
Let's go! Go!
Move it out!
Go, go, go!
Down, down, down!
It's clear.
Good work.
I thought you said it was clear!
It was!
Shit, I guess they're not in there
firing at us then.
Lindberg!
Yeah!
Light it up!
I'll cover you, Ice!
Don't cover shit! There's already
enough people shooting!
One bullet and this thing goes up
like a Roman candle!
Go! Shift fire!
Shift your fire!
Go, go! Shift your fire!
Shift your fire!
Go! Move it out!
Hit the deck!
Stay down! Wait for support!
Is this a bad battle or what?
It's a fucking slaughter.
Christ Jesus!
Get a machine gun team
set up over here, now!
Thank God! Tanks!
Runner! Get those tanks up here!
Oh, shit.
Get down!
Corporal, watch your left flank!
Let's go without them!
Move out! Move out!
lggy, you gotta lift your side,
he's gonna roll off.
Got it, Doc!
Incoming!
Move, move, move, move!
Keep moving!
Get that LVT up on the beach!
Keep moving!
You're next, pal,
we're getting you out of here.
Move it!
Great news.
Maybe if you live up on Camp Tarawa,
'cause that's where we're headed.
Not you and me.
Captain Severance asked me
who else was in that picture,
and Christ if I could remember,
but it was Mike and Doc and Franklin
and me and Hank Hansen
but I just remembered,
you were there, too.
I wasn't there.
'Course you were.
Neither was Hank.
He raised the first flag.
It was Harlon Block that raised that one.
Shit. I told them it was Hank.
You weren't there, Mr. Smart Ass,
how'd you know it was Harlon?
-You tell them it was me?
-No. Like I said, I just remembered.
Good, keep your mouth shut.
They know there was somebody else,
you can see it in the picture.
Then pick someone dead.
They don't want somebody dead,
you dumb redskin,
they want to ship us back to the States.
What did I tell you?
I wasn't there.
-You hear?
-All right.
Just settle down.
-I'm not going anywhere.
-You're not going anywhere.
Who the hell says?
This is horseshit.
You wounded, son?
No, sir.
Well, did you take out a nest of Japs
butt-naked with your bare hands?
'Cause if I'm gonna give up my seat
to a hero
he better have
a good goddamn story to tell.
No, sir.
Then enjoy it, 'cause they'll forget you
before Christmas.
The sixth man, you got a name?
Sorry, still don't remember.
It's a damn shame, 'cause I promised
the Major you'd know who it was.
Fact, you not knowing
throws a doubt on you
being one of the flag-raisers yourself.
Since no one wants to be embarrassed,
the moment you land
they'll turn you around,
ship you off to Okinawa
in time to meet your buddies
on the beach.
So, why don't you stop screwing
with me? Give me a damn name.
Gangway! Gangway!
Let's go, let's go! Gangway!
Where the hell is that son-of-a-bitch?
Hayes! Hayes?
Hayes, get your red ass over here!
Make me look like I don't know
what my own men are doing
with a flag the size
of my mother's house?
God damn it, Ira,
you shouldn't have lied to me.
You made me look like
a complete asshole.
We're gonna miss you around here.
Good luck.
Now your name's in the paper, too.
Just heard your doctor say
we're postponing your operation.
You're being shipped back
to the mainland.
Mrs. Hansen! Mrs. Hansen!
Did you know Hank was a hero?
-Are you proud of him, Mrs. Hansen?
-What was he like as a boy?
Look this way, please, ma'am.
What do you have to say
about your son?
Yeah, I might have thought
that was Harlon, too.
It is.
Belle, their names are right here.
It's not him.
And he would be alive
and sitting right here if it wasn't for you.
You think about that
when you look at his picture, Ed.
And I need to rush home and change
because there's the Governor's banquet
and then there's the parade.
Imagine, the Governor is coming here
to meet us.
Now, I'm wearing blue so, if...
-Are you going to change?
-
Hello?
Yes. Of course.
No, we understand. It wouldn't be right.
Thank you.
Here he is, gentlemen.
Senator Boyd, Senator Robson.
Senator Haddigan. I'd like you to meet
Private First Class Ira Hayes.
Damn good to meet you.
Proud to make your acquaintance, son.
Sorry?
That's Pima Indian talk, boy,
don't you know your own language?
Took forever to memorize
the damn gibberish.
Sorry, I've been away from
the reservation too long, Senator.
-Doc.
-Ira.
-That's you.
-Go, go, go, go. Go.
Holy shit.
Come in, come in, come in.
Bud Gurber, Treasury Department.
-Rene Gagnon.
-Bud Gurber.
-You showing the boys the sights?
-We saw a hell of a ball game.
That's great.
The bar's there, help yourself.
I got some briefing sheets for you here,
just some simple things
we want you to say.
Mostly, "Buy bonds,"
can't say that too often.
Itineraries, those are changing
every couple minutes.
Everybody wants to meet you guys.
I got women sending up envelopes
with stockings in them,
notes written in lipstick. We won't
mention that to the press, am I right?
Have a drink, for Christ's sake.
My God, what you boys
must have seen over there.
I've been watching the newsreels.
Jesus Christ, that was a fight and a half.
So, we got a hell of a lot of money
to raise, not a lot of time.
White House tomorrow,
then we trot you over
to shake hands with
a couple of hundred Congressmen
who won't pull a penny
out of their pockets.
Politicians and actors.
You put them in a restaurant together,
they'd die of old age
before picking up the check.
Then New York City, Times Square,
dinners with various hoi polloi,
then Chicago...
Who are these "Gold Star Mothers"?
That's what we're calling the mothers
of the dead flag-raisers.
You present each mother with a flag,
they say a few words,
people will shit money.
It'll be so moving.
But this says Hank Hansen's mom.
Lovely woman. She knows how close
you and her son were.
He wrote home about you.
She is very, very much
looking forward to meeting you.
Hank wasn't in the picture.
Sorry?
Hank didn't raise that flag.
He raised the other one, the real flag.
The what? The real...
The real flag? There's a real flag?
Yeah, ours was the replacement flag.
We put it up when they took
the other one down.
Am I the only one getting a headache
here? You know about this?
It was after it was already in the papers.
The mothers had already
been told, but...
That's it, that's beautiful.
Yeah, that's beautiful.
Yeah, why tell me?
I'm only the guy that has to explain it
to 150 million Americans.
Who is in the goddamn picture?
Are any of you guys
in the goddamn picture?
Yeah, we're in the goddamn picture.
Six guys raising a flag over lwo Jima.
Victory is ours.
You're three of them, right?
This was the fifth day, sir.
The battle went on for 35 more.
Well, what'd you do, raise a goddamn
flag every time you stopped for lunch?
Can I hit this guy?
You know what, I don't give a shit,
you're in the picture,
you raised the flag,
that's the story we're selling, boys.
Are you deaf? Hank isn't in the picture.
Harlon is in the picture.
Well, who the fuck is Harlon?
Harlon Block. That's whose mother
should be here if anyone's should be.
You know, I think this whole damn thing
is a farce, you ask me.
You know what they're calling
this bond drive? The Mighty Seventh.
They might've called it the
"We're Flat Fucking Broke
And Can't Even Afford Bullets
"So We're Begging For Your Pennies"
bond drive,
but it didn't have quite the ring.
They could've called it that, though,
because the last four bond drives
came up so short
we just printed money instead.
Ask any smart boy on Wall Street,
he'll tell you
our dollar is next to worthless,
we borrowed so much.
And nobody is lending any more.
Ships aren't being built.
Tanks aren't being built. Machine guns,
bazookas, hand grenades, zip.
You think this is a farce?
You want to go back to your buddies?
Well, stuff some rocks in your pockets
before you get on the plane
because that's all we got left
to throw at the Japanese.
And don't be surprised if your plane
doesn't make it off the runway
because the fuel dumps are empty.
And our good friends, the Arabs,
are only taking bullion.
If we don't raise $14 billion,
and that's million with a "B,"
this war is over by the end of the month.
We make a deal with the Japanese,
we give whatever they want
and we come home,
because you've seen them fight,
and they sure as shit ain't giving up.
$14 billion.
The last three drives
didn't make that much all together.
People on the street corners,
they looked at this picture
and they took hope.
Don't ask me why,
I think it's a crappy picture myself.
You can't even see your faces.
But it said we can win this war,
are winning this war,
we just need you to dig a little deeper.
They want to give us that money.
No, they want to give it to you.
But you, you don't want to ask for it.
You don't want to give them hope.
You want to explain about
this person and that flag.
Well, that's your choice.
Because if we admit we made a
mistake, that's all anybody'll talk about
and that will be that.
Gentlemen.
Mr. President, here they are.
-Well, hello. Good to see you.
-Mr. President.
Darn good to see you, boys.
Heard you had a hell of a fight
on your hands out there, hell of a fight.
Yes, sir.
Ira, you're off the Gila River Reservation
in Arizona, am I right?
Yes, Mr. President.
Being an Indian,
you are a truer American than any of us.
Bet your people are proud to see you
wear that uniform.
Very proud, sir.
They should be.
Well, I want to thank you for coming all
this way to Washington to help us out.
You fought for a mountain in the Pacific
now we need you to fight
for a mountain of cash.
-And I don't expect you'll let us down.
-No, sir.
Good. Go get it.
That's the end of this ceremony.
Let's take a look at this famous photo
over here, see if I can pick you out.
My gosh. There you are.
Boys. Boys, this one's on me.
To those who can't be with us.
Yes, sir.
Excuse me, Mr. Gagnon.
May we have your autograph?
I suppose.
And your name is?
I don't know about you,
but I get the impression
I'm drinking with the wrong heroes.
You're such a hero.
I feel honored to be in your presence.
That's just not true.
That's professional work.
Here, to professionals.
Here they are. You're the guys
in the photograph, right?
I heard you were on the train.
Let me shake your hands,
John Tennack.
John Bradley.
These boys are with me, Harvard
and Yale types, didn't fight a lick.
Pappies all rich sons-of-bitches.
Boys, shake hands
with some real war heroes.
Excuse me for one moment.
You can buy them a drink
while you're at it.
That's right. Drinks for these men
all the way around.
And you're the other one, aren't you?
John Tennack, Tennack Homes.
-Rene Gagnon.
-Pleased to meet you.
Have a drink, come on.
And here's my card.
Listen to me, Rene,
when you get finished
being famous you come see me
because if you can sell bonds,
you can sell homes.
Now, they're not gonna build homes
anymore, they're gonna deliver them.
-You heard of prefab homes?
-No, sir.
Well, you will. And you hang on to that
card and you come see me, you hear?
-All right?
-Certainly will.
All right.
This sure takes it, huh, Doc?
If Mike and the guys could see us.
Yeah, they'd hardly believe it,
would they?
Harlon!
Franklin!
Can you imagine Franklin
on this train
eating at the dining car
with all the silver?
We shouldn't be here, Doc.
Ira! Hey, Ira!
We heard the picture was posed!
What?
We heard you posed the picture!
Hey, Doc!
We're bigger than life, Doc!
Good job.
Thank you.
Especially him.
Jump on any grenades, Ira?
Take out any machine gun nests
I missed?
At least I fired my weapon.
All right, knock it off.
You hit anything
or were you too drunk then, too?
What?
Guys! Come on!
Stop it. Knock it off.
Rene, right here.
Sit between these two boys.
-Chocolate or strawberry, sir?
-Strawberry.
Chocolate or strawberry, sir?
Let's move! Go, go!
Easy Six, this is Easy Two, over.
Where the hell are our tanks?
Stuck in the sand.
Captain says you're to go without them.
Christ.
That's real good work
you're doing there, Rene.
All right, prepare to move out.
Pass the word.
Second Platoon! Move! Move! Move!
All right, Second Platoon, on your feet!
Let's move out!
Jackass.
Let's move out!
Go, go! Move, move, move!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Second Platoon, move out!
Doc!
Doc, get out of there!
Corpsman!
Doc!
Doc, get the hell out of there!
Okay, let's go. Let's go.
-Come on, boys.
-Let's go.
-Watch your step, ma'am.
-Thank you very much.
