- Oh, yeah.
When you get there,
be sure and give us a call.
- We want to know where you are.
- All right.
- How are you fixed for money?
- Oh, I'm OK.
You better take...
Take this 50 in case you run
into a mite of trouble.
You never know what's gonna happen
between here and there.
Thank you.
Well, boy...
Don't worry too much.
It's just the smart people
that have to worry.
The Lord will take care
of the ignorant ones.

- Huh? You paying attention?
Right.
I love you.
See you.

Excuse me, ma'am.
Could you spare some change?
That's a great hat you've got.
Can you spare
a couple nickels or dimes?
- Beautiful horse.
- Ma'am, could you spare some change?
I've never ridden a horse.
Is it difficult?
Well, would it be possible if
I could ride it, just a little ways?
Just once, for a minute?
Hey, lady, could I ride...
Come on. Please?
Woof, forget it.
I'll get you one for Christmas.

- Spare some change?
Spare some change?
Change. You know,
like nickels, dimes, quarters?

- Right.
- Why?
- Why?
No reason, except she's pregnant
and we haven't eaten for two days.
I don't believe you.
- Where you from?
- Oklahoma.
Listen, man, I know how it feels.
I used to come from Kansas myself.

Hey!
Where you going?
I got a lot of things to do today.
Thank you.
Hey!
Claude!
What?
Come here!
I want to show you something.
What is it?
Just come here, please.
- What?
- Look at that.
What?
- That's the chick on the horse.
- Oh, that's not her.
What do you mean?
Look at it.
Short Hills.
It's real close.
- That's today?
- That's right.
You want to go?
Why?
Why? Don't you want to meet her?
Don't you have
to be invited to those?
Would you like to come
to a party with me?
##
##
Come on, will you guys spread out?
Mingle.
Sit, my dear.
Steve? Steve?
- Great party, huh?
- Yeah.
Steve...
There's an odd-looking
character over there.
And here to the right,
that chap over there.
That colored gentleman over there
with the girl.
See those two girls there?
- Do you know them?
- No.
Why don't you just unobtrusively...
...see if you can find out
who they are, how they got here,
who invited them,
and come back and let me know, will ya?
- Sure thing.
- OK.
Hi, I'm Steve Wright.
- What's your name?
- Hud.
Hud.
Are you supposed to be here?
- I mean, who brought you guys?
- Mr. Berger.
Well, enjoy the party.
They're with Mr. Berger.
- Mr. Berger?
- Yeah.
Who's Mr. Berger?
I don't know.
Don't even suck on it
if you don't want to burn your lips.
- Now?
- Now start puffing on it.
- Now, now, now.
-
-
- There. See?
-  Sheila?
- Just a minute.
-
- Just a minute!
What's taking so long, love?
-  We're smoking grass.
- I'm getting dressed.
Sweetheart, come on. You have a lot
of people waiting to see you.
Will you relax, Daddy?
Well, hurry up.
- What's going on here?
- They're getting dressed.
Open the door this minute!
- I'm taking care of it.
- I can see you are.
Sheila?
- Yes?
-
There's no excuse
for this performance.
Hello.
Ted, Ted...
Excuse me. Mr. Berger?
- You can call me George.
- I think that it's a private party.
I think you and your friends
better leave, please.
- You do?
- Yes, I think that's the thing to do.
OK.
-
- Mr. Berger...
Excuse me, everybody.
- Everybody, please quiet down.
- Mr. Berger...
I think that you and your...
I just wanted to say a few words,
then we'll go.
- I don't care what you have to say.
- I know. Everybody, listen.
- We weren't invited to this party...
- Mr. Berger.
Just a second.
I just want to talk for a second, OK?
- I don't care about that.
- I know you don't care.
- I think you better leave.
- Please, just give me two minutes.
Just wanna talk to
the people for a second.
- All right?
- No.
- Please.
- No, I think you better go.
Please.
I'm losing my patience.
This is a private party.
You were not invited.
You'd better leave.
- You don't understand.
- I have nothing to understand.
You got something to understand.
You don't understand what this man
will be doing for you.
- I don't want to hear about it.
- You should hear about it!
- You know what he's gonna do for you?
- I don't care!
You should care because
he's gonna be fighting for you.
He's going to Vietnam to fight for you,
to save your life!
- I don't care what he's gonna do.
- To save your life!
Or what you're gonna do.
- I want you out!
- You should care!
If you want me out of here,
you'll have to throw me out.
That's exactly what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna get the police. I'm not gonna
muss myself up fussing with you.
- I'll get the police if I have to.
- OK.
- That's exactly what I'm gonna do.
- OK.
Penguin.
Now, my friend, Claude, here,
is in love.
He saw this chick on a horse...
- Excuse me.
- Jesus.
Now, let's deal
with this as gentlemen.
- OK. OK. Good.
- Quietly. As gentlemen.
- Now may I give you a word of advice?
- Yeah.
Get your ass out of here, now.
Is that it?
- That's it, yes.
- Thank you.
Now, listen.
Claude here is in love.
The girl he's in love with
is sitting in this room.
He just wants to sit here
and look at her for five minutes.
He just wants to look at her
and have this picture in his head
when he's off there fighting
in the jungles.
Is that so much to ask?
Hey! This is for you, man.
Wait a minute.
This is what you want.
Sheila, is that OK if Claude
just sits here and looks at you
for a few minutes before we go?
You've got a hell of a nerve,
young man.

Claude Bukowski,
George Berger,
Lafayette Johnson,
Jeannie Ryan, Woof Daschund.
The court is about to pronounce
sentence upon each of you.
The sentence of the court:
You be confined to the workhouse
for 30 days
or pay a fine of $50.
Your Honor,
I don't think you understand.
We haven't got any bread.
I'm awfully sorry.
There isn't anything I can do.
-  Your Honor?
- Yes, sir?
What if one of us has the money?
- Which one?
- I do.
You may proceed to pay your fine.
Proceed to the clerk's office.
- Excuse me, Your Honor.
-  What's your name?
- Bukowski.
- Wait a second. Put down George Berger.
- No!
- Berger...
- Bukowski.
- Just one second. Claude, listen.
Let me get out of here.
I'll go and get the money.
- Then I'll get everybody out.
- This is my money.
I'm sorry, but my dad gave me
this money in case of trouble.
- This is trouble.
- Don't be stupid, man.
This is your last chance
to get us out of here.
Just stop it. This is mine.
I'm getting out of here.
- Don't you trust me?
- Of course not.
Look, man, don't be stupid.
How will you get the bread?
You don't know anybody on the streets.
How you gonna get the bread?
He's not, man. He's just gonna leave us
in here to rot, that's all.
- No, I can make some calls.
- Yeah, call my mama.
You better know what you're doing.
You sure better, George.
What's that?
Uh, excuse me.
You're in our way.
What?
You're blocking our way.
Would you move, please?
Sure.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Remember me?
Yeah.
Come on in.
We have to get to school.
Great.
Just get in, will you?
What do you want?
What are you doing?
Where are you going?
Jesus H. Christ!
What do you think you're doing?
You can't drive this car! We're only
covered for Dad and me, OK? Sheila...
Listen, man, I got a little problem.
I need some bread right away.
It's $250.
I need it now.
- This is all about money?
- Yeah. You got any?
No.
Look, we really don't have any time now.
We've got to be at school.
So will you just stop the car? OK?
Just let me drive.
Sheila!
- What do you want me to do?
- Tell him to stop.
Stop.
Listen, my friends are still in jail.
So what I figured was
you could ask your old man
for the bread to get them out.
- Ask my father for the money?
- Yeah.
Right.
He got us into this.
At least he could get us out of it.
- He got you into this?
- Yeah.
He told you to dance on the table
and break all the dishes?
He didn't tell me to dance on the table.
There's a left here
at the bottom of the hill.
- I think you're really crazy.
- What are you talking about?
The man got the kids in jail.
We want the money to get them out.
- Coming up is a left.
- It's impossible.
- Why is it impossible?
- He won't even give me a credit card.
- With that house you live in?
- It's coming up here!
- Two hundred and fifty dollars.
- Right here!
Turn left! Right here!
Jesus! You missed it!
What did I miss, Steve?
The school. It's back there.
- Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
-  Mmm.
OK. Look, we'll help you, OK?
We'll try to get you some money. OK?
So you can stop the car now,
and I'll drive. OK?
- When?
- I don't know. Right after school.
OK, how's that? About 4:00, OK?
We'll have it for you at 4:00.
See, that's my other problem, man.
- What?
- You're full of shit.
You won't ask your old man for
the bread, and Junior is full of shit.
What am I doing here?
No, no, no, no...
- And men?
- Men? What do you mean?
Do you have any sexual attraction
towards men?
- Am I a homosexual or something?
- Yeah.
Well, I wouldn't kick Mick Jagger
out of my bed,
but I'm not a homosexual. No.
Can you tell me why you're so uptight
about having your hair cut?
# She asked me why
# I'm just a hairy guy
# I'm hairy, noon and night
# Hair that's a fright
# I'm hairy, high and low
# Don't ask me why
# Don't know
# It's not for lack of bread

Danny said to say hello.
He's in second year

and the girl he's dating
is beautiful, nice.
It's got a lot of mayonnaise,

- Eat it.
- Thanks, Mom.
- It's good. Eat it.
- I will.
Give me your pants.
I'll wash them.
- Why?
- They're dirty.
No, they're fine.
They're not dirty.
Yeah, they are. It'll take a minute.
The pants are fine, Ma.
What do you say, Pop?
What do you say, what?
Nothing, Ma. Nothing.
Pop?
- If you need money, get a job.
- Money? You talking about money?
- What do you need money for?
- Nothing, I just need it.
- Who is she?
- Who is who?
- The girl?
- What girl?
- Who is the girl?
- There's no girl.
You can tell us everything.
We understand everything.
What are you talking about?
I need some money.
If you need the money,
tell us the truth.
What are you talking about?
Goddamn it. Every time
you come home, there's trouble.
Why don't you clean yourself up?
Why don't you get a haircut?
Get a haircut,
and I'll give you the money.
You'll give me the money
if I get a haircut?
For Christ's sake,
do something to make us happy!
You'll give me the money
if I cut my hair?
- What?
- Will you give me $500?
- Give me your pants!
- My pants are clean!
Why? They're clean, for Christ's sake!
How much you need?

What?
Would you like to get married?
- To whom?
- Me.
Because I was thinking I'm having
this baby, and, if you were married,
the Army couldn't take you.
They wouldn't take you because they

Claude!
Claude!
Claude Bukowski!
Hey, Berger.
Right there.
Are you all right?
Hey, you OK?
Where you been?
Where have we been?
Where have you been, man?
Watching the water.
Watching the water? Let me
see your eyes. Let me see those.
Oh, my God, black basketballs.
Look at my face.
Look at the sky.
Look at the stars.
- See the stars?
- Look at that.
Everybody,
a shooting star right over there.
Quick, everybody, make a wish.
Berger?
Will you take me home now, please?
Why do you want to go home?
It's Claude's last night.
Right?
Are we going to do something?
- Yeah, we'll do something.
- Yeah.
What are you gonna do?
I don't know.
It's Claude's night.
What do you want to do?
Take Sheila home.
Hey, she's all yours.
Have a good time.
- I'm just taking her home.
- I know.
- Have a good time anyway.
-
Come on, Jeannie.
Come on.
- Whoa!
Get your pants off and come on in!
You want to go home?
- You're just taking me home, right?
- Yeah.
- No, you know what I mean.
- I'm just taking you home.
Because nothing's gonna happen.
No, I'm just gonna take you home.
No. No, no. I think
I'll go home by myself.
No, I'll take you home.
- I don't feel like it.
- Why not?
I don't have to
explain everything to you...
...do I?
Come on! Come on, will ya?
The water is filthy, you know.
Listen, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to be so...
I'm really sorry.
I wasn't trying to upset you.
That's all right.
It's just sometimes I get so...
I understand.
- You're upset, right?
- Oh, no.
No, you are.
I'm sorry. It's my fault.
I just... But I just thought...
- You're going away tomorrow, right?
- Yeah.
So, what's the point?
You mean, if I wasn't going away,
it would be different?
Maybe.
Well...
- I might not go.
- Right.
- You expect me to believe that?
- I'm serious.
Forget it.
I don't believe you.
Hey... Where did everybody else go?
They're around somewhere.
Jeannie's still up there.
Hey, where are our clothes?
- Where did they take them?
-
Funny, funny, funny!
You guys are so mature.
Don't look at me.
I didn't have anything to do with it.
Don't worry about it.
They're around.
Berger!
Sheila...
- Taxi! Taxi!
-
Don't go!
I've got your purse! Sheila, wait!
I don't believe it, man.
What happened?
What happened?
What the hell did you do that for?
- It was fun, man.
- Fun?
I'm really sorry.
I didn't think she'd ever
pull a stunt like that.
We know where she lives. We'll give
her clothes back tomorrow. It's cool.
I won't be here tomorrow.
You're not still serious
about that shit, are you?
That's none of your goddamn business.
It is my goddamn business, man.
What do you want?
You want to be a hero with a gun,
a big macho dude in a uniform?
- Is that what you want?
- I can't talk to you.
I'm standing right here.
Talk to me.
I'm right here. Talk to me.
I think you're ridiculous.
I am ridiculous.
I'm totally ridiculous.
I'm ludicrous.
I don't want to go over there
and murder women and babies.
Go ahead and be ridiculous,
and I'll do what I have to do.
Who are you doing it for?
I'm doing it for you, man.
Look, don't hand me that.
If you're doing it for me, don't.
Because if the shoe was on the
other foot, I wouldn't do it for you.
Give me my clothes.
How will she get home? She doesn't
have her stuff. She has no bread.
You better get that stuff to her.
- Me?
- Yeah.
Wasn't that what you wanted?
You're telling me I'm ridiculous?

Hey, Berger! Berger!
Hey. How you doing?
- I'm all right.
- Yeah?
Look, I've got something.
Where is he?
Nevada!
So, I was thinking of writing him.
- What do you think I should say?
- I want to say something.
Tell him that... I want to say
that Jeannie says hi.
You're gonna write him?
Why don't you come with us?
- Where are you going?
- Nevada.
We are?
Aren't you serious about anything?
I'm always serious.
When are we going?
As soon as Sheila's ready.
I can't just take off and go to Nevada.
No, I guess not.
- We'll see you.
- Wait a minute.
- How will you get there?
- Car.
Lafayette!
- You don't have a car.
- I'm gonna get a car.
- Lafayette?
- How? How can you get a car?
What are you staring at?
And who's that?
What are you doing here?
Come on.
- I said come with me.
- I heard you.
I'm asking you, who is that woman?
- Are you a friend of my Lafayette?
- I ain't no Lafayette no more.
- Don't bother her, all right?
- What have you done to your head?
Never mind.
Just go on back home.
Is that his child?
- Look, don't be talking to her.
- Is that your child?
You wouldn't understand.
What do you mean?
Is that your child or isn't it?
What kind of question is that?
Maybe it is and maybe it isn't.
What?
I knew you wouldn't understand.
You don't understand anything.
I understand just fine.
You explain it to me.
Do you understand about cosmic
consciousness and all kind of that shit?
That's what I'm talking about, baby.
All I'm talking about
is Lafayette Junior here is your child.
I just want to know
if that's your child too.
Never mind that. Come on.
Come on!
- Where are we going?
- I'm taking you to the bus.
- You're going back home. Come on!
- I don't want to go home!
You're going back home.
Understand me?
- I want to stay with you.
- You can't.
- Why not?
- Because you can't. I said so.
Look, we've got a friend in trouble,
and we have to help him.
Baby, that's all you need to know.
Why don't you just go home?
I never said you couldn't
help your friends, Lafayette.
Goddamn it, woman!
I ain't no Lafayette!
Shit! Don't you understand nothing?

- Hi, Steve.
- Hi.
Wanna come out of the car
for a minute?
No.
- I just want to talk to you.
- You want to talk? Talk.
I'd like to talk to you outside.
I don't want to talk to you.
Don't worry about a thing.
I'll handle this.
- OK. What do you want?
- The keys.
No. Hey, come on...
Cool out, baby.
- No, you're taking the car?
- Just for a few days.
- Coming with us?
- No, I'm not going with you!
- All right.
- Sheila, come on.
Out of the car. Sheila! What...
Sheila!
I'm not into any heavy preference trip,
you know, like who the father is.
I don't care.
I think they're both beautiful.
Don't you?
But how can you not care about that?
If a woman carries a child, don't you
think she should know who the father is?
Well, I admit that I have this dilemma.
But it will be resolved real soon.
It's not like a big crisis or anything.
It's not like a world war.
I don't know
what you're so uptight about.
I fell in love with someone.
We had a child,
and we were gonna get married.
That's why I'm uptight.
- Yeah?
- And you're holding it up!
No, I'm not holding it up.
You don't see the way it is.
This is really a great thing
that's happened to all of us.
Everybody's really happy about it.
The guys are really happy.
I think it would be great
if you could be happy about it, too.
- You're crazy.
- Yeah, I'm crazy.
We're all crazy.
Let's shake on it.
Let's not.
Come on.
If all you men could be standing
where I'm standing
and seeing what I'm seeing,
you'd know how it feels
to be truly proud of our country.
The United States Army is the greatest
fighting force in the world.
And now, you men...
...are going to be thousands of miles
away from home in a few days.
And you'd better take some
of that greatness with you.
And this afternoon,
while you're on leave,
you'd better take some of it
with you, too.

Hi.
- How you doing? What can I do for you?
- We're going in.
I'm sorry, but there's no civilian
contact allowed on the base right now.
- We're on alert. You can't come in.
- We're not civilians.
We're friends of a guy on the base.
His name's Claude Bukowski.
- You probably know him. He's a private.
- I don't know him.
Really nice guy with blonde hair.
He's short.
I don't know him. You'll have to turn
your vehicle around and go off post.
All right? If you need some help,
I'll be glad to assist you.
Otherwise, back your vehicle up
and turn it around.
Listen, we don't want
to make any trouble.
- Turn around and you won't, OK?
- Just let me make a phone call.
No, you don't make it here.
You make it where I tell you to go.
You just said you wanted
to give me some assistance...
I'll help you turn around.
That's all.
- You don't understand...
- Chief, this is it.
Turn around and go.
We clear?
- You get my drift, right?
- You don't understand, man.
- You don't understand.
- We've driven five days straight!
- Listen, my man...
- I just want to see my friend.
I'm telling you
to get the hell off my post.
Turn around and go that way.
That's what I'm telling you.
You listen to me.
I'm not listening to you. Got that?
Thank you.
Have a nice day.
##
Uh, what's your name?
- What's your name?
- George.
- What's yours?
- Sheila.
Yeah?
- Is your husband on base?
- I'm not married.
I'm visiting my brother.
No, wait. Wait, wait, wait.
OK, this time I'll do it.
Hey, that was a really good one.
Let me do that again.
OK, I'll blow one,
and then you blow one,
and see if they can, you know...
You blow one through one of mine, OK?
Ooh! There, they did it.
-  Toot, toot!
-
Where is it? Where is your car?
Right over there.
Hi.
God Almighty.
-
-
Hey... Hey, let's pull over there.
Stop, stop. Let's stop here.
Company, halt.
- Dismissed.
- "Dismissed?"
Hey!
You cutie-pie!
Come here, my cutie!
Watch my hat!
Hey! What are you doing?
Hey!
Hey, baby!

-
Hey! That's my car!
Hey!

# I want to go to Vietnam...
What are you doing?
- Get in the trunk.
- What?
- Come on. Get in the trunk quick.
- Why?
Everybody's waiting. We have a big
picnic planned for you in the desert.
- Come on, get in.
- The base is on alert.
They're taking head counts all the time.
If I'm not here, I've had it.
Listen, it's just for a couple of hours.
I'll have you back in time for dinner.
- I can't.
- What do you mean?
We just drove 2,000 miles to see you.
Everybody is waiting.
Just trust me, will ya?
I have it all figured out.
You're making it sound
like I don't want to come.
Then come.
Get in the trunk.
I mean...
I can't believe you're here.
I just can't believe it.
Traveling all that way?
I can't believe it.
I appreciate your coming here.
I can't tell you.
Don't tell me, just come with us.
Just get in the trunk.
You don't understand.
This isn't a game.
What will I tell everybody?
- Did Sheila come?
- Yeah.
- And Jeannie?
- Everybody's there, man.
How is Sheila?
How is she?
What are you doing?
Give me your clothes.
- Claude!
- Hey!

I gotta go. We all gotta go.
So let's move it right now!
Let's get on the red line.
Let's go.
What in the hell are you waiting on?
Get that web gear on!

# Darling
# Give me a head with hair
Long, beautiful hair
# Shining, gleaming
steamin', flaxen, waxen
# Give me it down to there
Hair
# Shoulder-length or longer
# Here, baby, There, Mama
Everywhere, Daddy, Daddy
# Hair
# Flow it, Show it
# Long as God can grow it
My hair
# I'll let it fly in the breeze
# And get caught in the trees
# Give a home to the fleas
in my hair
# A home for fleas
# A hive for the buzzin' bees
# A nest for birds
There ain't no words
# For the beauty, the splendor
the wonder of my hair
# Flow it, Show it
# Long as God can grow it
My hair
# I want it long, straight
curly, fuzzy
# Snaggy, shaggy, ratty, matty
oily, greasy, fleecy
# Shining, gleaming, steaming
# Flaxen, waxen
knotted, polka-dotted
# Twisted, beaded, braided
- # Powdered, flowered
- # And confettied
- # Bangled
- # Tangled, spangled
# And spaghettied
# Oh, say can you see my eyes?
- # If you can
- # Then my hair's too short
# Down to here
Down to there
# Down to there
Down to where it stops by itself
# They'll be ga-ga at the go-go
When they see me in my toga
# My toga made of blond
brilliantined, biblical hair
# My hair like Jesus wore it
# Hallelujah, I adore it
# Hallelujah, Mary loved her son
# Why don't my mother love me?
