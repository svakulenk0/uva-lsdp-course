Did you hear it?
What?
Let's go, Timmy!
Let's go!
Come on, Major!
They've got to be
somewhere, Ronnie.
Watch out.
You've got to stay
in the ravine.
Shh.
Shh.
Go! Go! Go!
Look, there they are!
Wipe them out!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
You're dead,
and you know it!
No, I'm not!
Ronnie's dead!
No, I'm not!
No, I'm not!
Look at the mayor.
I wonder where
your mom is.
Where is that woman?
Hey!
Hi.
~ 3 o'clock,
~ 5, 6, 7 o'clock ~
~ 8 o'clock rock ~
~ 9, 10, 11 o'clock,
~ We're gonna rock
around the clock tonight ~
~ Put your glad rags on ~
~ And join me, hon ~
~ We'll have some fun
when the clock strikes 1:00 ~
~ We're gonna rock around
the clock tonight ~
Donna!
Donna,
come back here!
Get out of the way!
Hey, you boys!
Stop that!
~ When the band slows down ~
~ We're gonna
yell for more ~
~ We're gonna rock around
the clock tonight ~~
Donna! Donna!
Stevie Boyer just
gave Mary Barnett a ring.
Can you believe it?
Over there.
O.K.
Come here,
come here.
What is this?
Is this a firecracker?
What's wrong with you?
Hey!
Hey!
This is boring.
Yeah, square, man.
Look, Daddy, the soldiers!
Happy birthday,
Ronnie Kovic.
For me?
Yes. Open it.
That's really nice, Donna.
Say thank you, Ronnie.
Thanks, Donna, but
you didn't have to.
Going to
the woods tonight?
They'll have
fireworks there.
Should be a real blast.
Yeah, O.K.
What is it?
Open it.
Leave him alone.
Beautiful.
Hey, it's the real thing,
Ronnie.
Feel that.
Just like
Mickey Mantle, Ronnie.
Ain't he a 4th ofJuly
firecracker in that hat?
Yeah. He's my little
Yankee-Doodle boy.
Hey, get it!
Get it!
Come on!
Let's go!
Did you like it?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Hey, look how many
push-ups I can do.
Wow! Yeah!
Yeah!
Come on, Ronnie!
Go, Ronnie, go!
Go, Ronnie!
You can do it!
Go!
Yes!
Yes! That's my boy!
That's my boy!
Yes!
Ronnie, you made it!
Yeah, all right!
Tommy! Ronnie!
Come on!
You're going
to miss it!
Michelle! Barbara!
You've got to see this!
You'll get a licking
if you're late!
Look, President Kennedy,
Daddy.
That's right.
He's so handsome.
I had a dream, Ronnie,
the other night,
and you were speaking
to a large crowd
just like him.
Just like him.
And you were saying
great things.
Right! Right up!
Get out!
Got to get out!
You got to get out!
You got to get out!
Hit that switch!
Hit the switch!
All right,
hit the ropes!
Go, go, go!
Hand over hand over hand!
Get those legs
off those ropes!
Come on, ladies,
let's come down!
Let's come down!
That rope is like life!
You grab it
and hang onto it! Next!
I want you to kill!
You hear me?
Yes, sir!
Kill!
I want that
conference championship!
Do you want that conference
championship?
Yes, sir!
Get up! Heads!
Get them up!
Do you hear me?
Get your heads up, ladies!
Get your heads up!
I want that
conference championship!
Susanne, no homework
at the table, please.
No, Tommy.
After supper.
Dad?
Yeah?
Can I come
with you?
There's the next
conference champion.
Sorry I'm late, Ma.
There's rice
on the stove
and fruit
in the icebox.
I can't.
It's on your diet, right?
I got to drop
by Saturday.
Your brother's
a hard worker, Tommy,
'cause he wants
to be the best.
Win or lose... in school,
in sports, in life...
as long
as you do your best,
that's what matters
to God.
Win or lose,
we still love him.
Can I go
to my room?
Yeah, sure.
Thank you, God,
for this food.
In the name
of the Father, the Son,
the Holy Ghost, amen.
Daddy, Jimmy
took my doll!
I'll get the doll.
I hate his guts!
Just go to bed.
I didn't take anything!
Where's
your sister's doll?
Jackie? Why
is Jackie not in bed?
Ronnie.
Where'd you get this?
Why are you
in my room?
Don't change
the subject.
I don't allow
magazine
in this house.
Stevie gave it to me.
You have filthy,
impure thoughts!
God's going
to punish you.
I haven't even looked
at it yet, all right?
Go to confession.
I want you to tell
Father McKenna.
I don't want to see
this filthy magazine
in my house again.
Now, take this away!
What's going on?
Nothing.
What do you mean,
nothing?
Nothing, Dad. O.K.?
You're out
of bounds, guys.
Back inside.
Come on, Kovic,
back inside.
Come on, Kovic.
Go, Ronnie.
Kovic, back inside.
Come on, Kovic.
Back inside.
Let's go.
I want to see
some explosion!
Come on, Ronnie!
No messing around!
You're great, Ronnie!
You're great, Ronnie!
Stay with him!
Come on down!
All right!
O.K. Get off
the mat.
You're going
to get...
Get him! Get him!
Get him! Get him!
Reversal.
All right!
Oh, yes, yes, yes,
yes, yes!
Ohh, you!
One, red!
You're both up.
All right,
fresh start.
Fresh start.
Stand up.
Don't let him
get you!
Don't
let him get you!
Pull him out!
All right!
Watch those legs.
Watch him!
Get him down!
Don't let him
get the neck!
No! No!
No!
You can beat him,
Ronnie!
Come on! Come on!
Come on!
Ronnie, Ronnie, Ronnie!
Bridge! Bridge!
You can win!
Don't give up!
Aah!
Oh, no!
O.K., son?
Oh, no.
Come on, get up.
Attention!
Forward march!
Left, left.
Left, right, left.
Seats!
Good morning.
I am Gunnery
Sergeant Hayes.
This is
Sergeant Bowers.
United States Marine
recruiting station,
Levittown, New York.
We are here today
at the request
of your principal,
Mr. Richards
and other members
of the faculty
to tell you
a little bit about
the Marine Corps.
First off, young men,
let's get
one thing straight.
Not everybody becomes
United States Marines.
We want the best,
and we'll accept nothing
but the best,
because there
is nothing prouder,
nothing finer, nothing
standing as straight
as a United States Marine.
Now, they've got the army.
They got the navy.
They got
the air farce.
And if you want
to join them,
be my guest.
But if you want
a challenge...
if you want to try
something difficult...
if you want to try to
achieve the impossible...
you try 13 weeks of hell
at Parris Island,
South Carolina,
and you'll find out
if you got what it takes.
You'll find out
if you really are a man,
then the marines may be
what you're looking for.
Tarawa...
IwoJima...
Belleau Wood...
the frozen
Chosin reservoir.
First to fight.
We have never lost a war.
We have always come when
our country's called us.
Now, Sergeant Bowers and I
would like to open this up
to questions.
So if any of you young men
do have questions,
go ahead
and raise your hands.
Come on, now.
Don't be afraid.
Don't forget, a good
marine's a thinking marine.
Billy Vorsovich, sir.
When would I get to wear
a uniform like you?
You can be wearing this
in 13 weeks.
Go! Go!
Go, Massapequa!
Go! Go! Go!
Yay!
Yay!
Hi, Donna.
Go! Go!
Go, Massapequa!
Go!
My brother's
at school at Adelphi.
He said there
will be a war in...
What is it?
Vietnam.
The marines will be
the first in,
and it won't last long.
So if we don't sign up
soon, we'll miss it.
I've already decided.
I'm going in.
Really?
Just like that?
I'm not waiting.
I'm going in now.
You're crazy.
Our dads
got to go to WW II.
This is our chance
to be part of history.
Yeah, just like
our dads.
Think about
what you're doing.
It could be dangerous
over there.
You could
get yourself killed.
Where are you going,
squirrel head?
College?
I want to do something
with my life.
I can get a degree in
business administration.
You don't need
to serve your country?
Don't you care
about anybody
but yourself?
Better dead than red.
They got missiles pointed
at us everywhere. ICBMs.
Coming in
all around us.
Cuba now.
They're taking over.
When will we stop them?
You can't stop them
by yourself.
Communism is
moving in everywhere.
Where, Ronnie?
I don't see them.
They're not here
in Massapequa,
so I'll just take care
of number one.
That's right.
Me... Stevie,
number one.
Someone's got to stay
with the women and children
while the men
go do the fighting.
All I'm saying is,
think about it.
Think about it,
Ronnie.
Stevie, who
are you taking
to the prom?
Wendy Daniels.
Wendy Daniels?
Wendy Daniels?
Didn't the S.P.C.A.
take her away?
Well, who are you taking,
Joey, your mother?
Ronnie, who are you going
to take to the prom?
You don't know her.
She's a pretty girl
from Ronkonkoma.
What's her name?
You don't know her.
What's her name,
Ronnie?
Her name
is Lombardi.
Lombardi?
Yeah.
Vince Lombardi?
Rosanna Lombardi.
She's from
out of town, right?
She going
to get a motel?
'Cause I'd like
to get in on that.
Ronnie, would
you take this
to section three?
Check the stock
for dog food.
Dog food.
Then finish
stacking the potatoes.
Come on. Let's go.
Let's do some work
for a change.
This goes
in section three?
Section three.
O.K., Dad.
Hey, Donna.
Hi, Ronnie.
Hi, Ronnie.
Hi, Ronnie.
How you doing?
How's...
Good.
I heard that you were going
into the marines.
Yeah, yeah.
It's better than
working at A&P.
That's great,
Ronnie.
That's wonderful.
I'm going
to boot camp soon.
I joined
for four years,
so I go to Vietnam,
probably on
the front line.
Really?
I'll see
a lot of action.
Wow.
That's neat.
Heard you got
into that school.
The letter?
Yeah.
Yeah, Syracuse.
It's going to be
really hard.
Could I... Could I talk
to you in private?
Oh, yeah. Sure.
I've been meaning
to call you.
I was wondering,
are you going with
someone to the prom?
Yeah. I'm going
with Jed.
Oh, yeah?
That's great.
I mean, he's
a nice guy... Jed.
Stevie Boyer told me
that you were
taking some girl
from Lake Ronkonkoma.
Yeah. No, no.
No?
No. I don't have time
for that stuff.
There's a lot of things
to take care of
before you go
in the marines.
I didn't even know
how much stuff.
Maybe I'll see you
before I leave, O.K.?
I told you
I love you.
You promised.
~ And rattle
your walls ~
~ For the times,
they are a-changin' ~
~ Come, senators
and congressmen ~
~ Please heed the call ~
~ Don't stand
in the doorway ~
~ Don't lock up
the hall ~
~ For the times,
they are a-changin' ~~
What do you think,
Dad, about that?
I don't know.
That's a long way to go
to fight a war.
I just hope they send you
to Europe or Korea or...
They can't.
Someplace safe.
Every marine has
a tour of duty there.
It's not like the army.
What's wrong with you?
You served.
Uncle Bob served.
I know, Ronnie.
I know.
Remember what
President Kennedy said?
There won't be
an America anymore
unless people
are willing to sacrifice.
I love my country.
I know.
And you're right,
Ronnie.
You're doing
the right thing.
Communism has
to be stopped.
It's God's will you go.
We're proud of you.
Be careful, that's all.
Don't you know
what being a marine
means to me, Dad?
Ever since I was a kid,
I've wanted
to serve my country,
And I want to go.
I want to go to Vietnam,
and I'll die there
if I have to.
Not a nice night
for the prom.
Sometimes, God,
I'm so confused.
Sometimes
I think I'd just...
like to stay here
in Massapequa
and never leave...
but I got to go.
Just help me, Jesus.
Help me to make
the right decision.
Please, dear God.
Ron.
Ronnie, what
happened to you?
Ronnie.
What...
Oh, jeez.
Donna.
Ronnie.
Will you
dance with me?
Oh, yes.
Yeah, sure.
Sit rep as follows...
Two set in
on the beach.
The tracks are
moving this way.
Sounds like
"boo-coo" gooks
in there.
I'm finally
going to see one.
Relax, you'll be
all right.
Where you from, Wilson?
First Battalion,
Ninth Motor "T."
The sergeant major
said the grunts
needed replacements,
so they took me out
of battalion supply.
Where are you from
in the world?
Oh, Venus, Georgia.
This is my second tour.
I haven't seen
a Georgia boy
get hurt yet.
You'll be all right.
All right.
Echo-1 's taking incoming
northwest edge of the ville.
We got gooks
moving this way.
Look out there,
Sergeant.
Can you see them?
Right there.
You see them?
They got rifles.
Can you see the rifles?
Right there.
You see them?
You see them?
Can you see
the rifles?
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
Pass the word.
When I give the order,
I want to light up
this ville
like a mother fucking
Christmas tree.
This time I think
we got them! Move out.
Pass the word!
Fire on command!
Wilson, come with me.
Cover that big hooch!
Fire on my command!
Pass the word!
Corporal, start ranking.
Fire on my command!
Fire on my command!
Cease fire!
What happened?
What the fuck
are you doing?
Cease fire!
What happened?
Cease fire!
I want to know
what happened!
I don't know, sir.
Possible accidental
discharge, sir.
We better get
a sweep team in there.
Take five men.
Tell me how many we got.
Yes, sir.
Motherfucker!
Baldy, on me!
Brooks!
Martinez! On me!
Wilson!
Wilson, on me!
moving on the ville
at this time. Over.
Line! Line! Line!
Baldy! Baldy!
Get him out!
Get him out!
Come on,
Baldy, come on.
Check it out over there!
Everything out!
Baldy, get
everything out!
Baldy! There!
Check it out!
Get him out!
Get him out!
Oh, my God.
We didn't
do this, did we?
Oh, my God.
Jesus Christ.
Oh, my God.
better get down
here quick,
and bring
the corpsmen.
We got "boo-coo"
wounded. Civilians.
Martinez, help me!
We wasted them.
Motherfucker,
we wasted them!
Oh!
Where are the rifles?
Where are the rifles?
There ain't no fucking rifles.
Jesus fucking Christ.
Well, help him then!
Help him!
Help him! Help him!
Oh, what the...
I want you
to help him.
Forgive us.
Help me!
Somebody help me!
Request
emergency medevac.
We got a lot
of friendly wounded.
Over.
Get back
to the dunes!
We got gooks
in the ville! Move out!
Get out! Move out!
That's a direct order!
I want you
out that door!
It wasn't your fault!
They got in the way!
Get off the deck!
We got gooks
in the ville!
The baby!
Get back to the dune!
The baby!
No! Move out!
Let's move!
Kovic, move!
Move out!
Move out!
Move! Move!
The ville is
going to blow!
Aah!
Red! Abbot!
Aah!
Wilson!
Wilson's hit!
What happened?
Where's
First Platoon?
For God's sake,
corpsman!
Where's my "A" gunner?
Sergeant Kovic
here to see you, sir.
Stand easy, Sergeant.
Yeah, Kovic,
the lieutenant told me
that was
a pretty rough time.
Yes, sir.
It was pretty bad.
Ran into a few of them?
Yes, sir.
You want to see me
about something, Sergeant?
Yes, sir.
Like I said
to the captain, uh, sir...
it was a very
confusing day.
The villagers...
Yeah. I know about
the villagers, Sergeant.
They...
The villagers...
It was very,
very unfortunate.
The enemy used
the villagers as cover.
Yes, sir.
They popped up,
started firing.
We were
running back, sir.
It was real glary.
Very confusing,
and that's when
it happened, sir.
What happened?
Sir, that was when
Wilson was killed, sir.
Yeah, I know
about Wilson.
Sir, see...
he was
the last one out,
and that's when
it happened, sir.
Sir, I think I might...
I might have
killed him, sir.
I don't think so.
He was coming up
over the dune.
I think I might
have killed him.
It's hard.
I was out a couple
of weeks ago.
Sometimes it's...
very hard to tell
what's happening.
Yes, sir.
But, sir, I think
I killed Wilson.
I don't think so, Kovic.
But, sir, I want you
to know that...
Don't talk like that!
Don't tell me this shit.
I'll take your head off.
Is that clear?
Yes, sir.
That clear?
Yes, sir!
All right.
Carry on.
XO ought to
court-martial his ass.
Sergeant K.
Get some sugar
in the blood.
Ain't no thing, Dog.
Ain't nothing
but a thing, baby.
Shit, it's so hot out here
I want to kill some gooks.
Dog, you're sounding
like a bitch.
Ain't nothing
but a thing.
Nothing but a thing.
It's so hot
in this motherfucker,
this must be hell!
Or purgatory.
Where the mother fuckin'
devil at?
Take cover!
Take cover!
Take cover!
No. No, people!
Move forward!
Move forward!
Gun up! Gun up!
Uhh!
Uhh!
Son of a bitch!
Aah!
Aah!
Fuck, man!
Uh.
Aah!
Aah!
Fuck!
Son of a bitch!
Heavy incoming
from the ville!
I'm in trouble!
Aah!
I'm in trouble
out here!
I'm in trouble
out here!
I need everything
you got!
Motherfucker!
Aah!
God damn it!
God damn it!
Corpsmen...
Corpsmen...
Corpsmen... corpsmen.
Goddamn motherfucker.
Motherfucker!
Motherfucker!
Motherfuckers!
We got six
sucking chest wounds
and 12 crispy critters
coming in!
Zap him with 250 mils
of happy juice
until he crashes out.
Just get him to sleep.
Open table!
What do we have?
His kidney
and liver are gone.
We better just kiss
this one good-bye.
All right, take off.
There's something
wrong with me.
Code blue! Code blue!
Let's go!
He's code blue!
Code blue! Code blue!
Get the machine!
Get the machine!
Let me in.
Let me in.
Stay with me, marine.
Stay with me!
Give me
the shock defibs!
Stay with me now.
We're going to
jump-start you. Clear!
Where's the priest?
Get me a priest.
Breathe! Breathe!
Breathe!
Breathe!
I took the Packers
at minus 7.
They ain't
got a chance.
How are you?
You tell them
they've got to operate.
There's something
wrong with me.
The doctors are real busy.
There's a lot
of wounded here.
There's no time for anything
except trying to stay alive.
You got to try
and stay alive. O.K.?
Try and stay alive.
I've come to give you
your last rites.
Are you ready?
I'm ready, Father.
I am the resurrection
and the life.
He that believeth in me,
though he were dead,
yet shall he live.
We brought nothing
into this world,
and it's certain
we can take nothing out.
The Lord giveth, and
the Lord taketh away.
Blessed be the name
of the Lord.
~ I got sunshine ~
~ On a cloudy day ~
~ And when it's
cold outside ~
~ I got
the month of May ~~
Eddie, I need
some help in room 13.
Give me
a second, man.
His catheter's
plugging up.
It's backing up
into his kidney.
I said I'd be there.
Give me a break.
Man, what's going up?
Nothing, man.
You ain't supposed
to be having this.
Oh!
Didn't I tell you not
to do that to him
in the a.m.?
Take the needle
out of my arm.
Good morning,
Nurse Washington.
How are you today?
You up bright
and early today.
Everybody up!
Good morning, gentlemen.
Let's rise and shine.
Peña!
Can I have
some aspirin?
I ain't feeling well.
I'd like
some aspirin.
Hmm. I'll get to you.
Leon! How you

Look at this shit.
Mm-hmm!
My catheter's
clogged.
Give it a minute.
They're getting
bigger every day.
You don't bother them,
they ain't going
to bother you.
That's why
I'm feeding him.
Keep on feeding him,
and everything'll be fine.
Up and at 'em!
Frankie's here!
Hey, Frankie.
What's up?
Hopkins, come on,

Come on.
Let's look alive.
Looking good.
Looking good.
Come on, Kovic.
Real nice.
How many

Let's go for seven, then.
Come on, Ronnie.
That a way.
Get up there.
Get up there.
Keep going.
Come on, fucking marine.
There you go.
Real nice.
~ This'll be the day
that I die ~~
We want to make one thing
very clear to you, Ron.
The possibility of your
ever walking is minimal.
Almost impossible.
You're a T-6, paralyzed
from the midchest down.
Probably you'll be
in a wheelchair
for the rest of your life.
Do you understand
what I'm saying?
Well, Doctor, will...
Hmm?
Will I ever be able
to, uh...
to have children?
No.
No, but we have
a very good
psychologist here.
He's helped...
Oh, I'll walk again.
I know I'll walk again.
Let me
tell you something.
You will
walk again.
Let's go.
Uhh!
Uhh!
You're walking good
in these things.
What am I
looking like, good?
You're one crazy marine.
So gung ho,
but you don't know shit
about what's going on
in this country.
Fuck you.
It ain't about
burning the flag
and Vietnam.
Why fight
for rights there?
We ain't got rights
at home.
It's about Detroit
and Newark.
It's about racism, man,
but you can't get
no job at home.
Vietnam's
a white man's war,
a rich man's war.
Where's my money?
You got
to read some books.
There's a revolution
going on.
If you ain't part
of the solution,
then you's part
of the problem.
Will you just get
my chair for me?
You got to watch
for her.
Oh, man.
Good stuff.
Take the bra off.
I'll give you
another 10.
Why, sure, sugar.
Like this?
Oh, shh! Shh!
Yeah. Yeah.
Suck on my tits.
Honey, anything
you want.
Shh!
Oh!
Oh.
~ I guess you'd say ~
~ What could make me
feel this way ~
~ My girl ~
~ My girl ~
~ My girl ~
~ Talking 'bout my girl ~
~ My girl ~~
Good.
Easy now.
Easy now.
Very good.
Hey, Doc...
it's really beautiful
up here.
Ha ha ha!
I'm walking
out of here, guys.
You'll see.
Right, Willie?
Right.
Easy.
Oh... I'm all right.
I'm all right.
O.K. That's enough
for today.
O.K.
Now, good. Good.
Easy, now.
Easy, now.
Don't go too far.
Don't do too much.
Looking good today.
Looking good.
Don't go too far.
All right!
Way to go, Kovic.
Amazing, huh?
Nothing from
the chest down.
It can be done.
It can be done.
motherfucker!
All right!
All right, Harry, man.
Keep it going. Let's go!
Let's go. Let's go.
Let's go.
Aah!
Oh!
Willie!
I think I need...
Oh! Oh.
Get him up.
Somebody...
Something snapped.
It's my neck.
All right.
Just my neck.
Harry!
Hang on. Hang on.
What was that sound?
Oh shit.
What?
Oh!
It's fine.
We're doing fine.
Is that my bone?
Harry, Harry,
get a doc.
Am I O.K.?
It's O.K.
Everybody relax.
Harry! Let's go!
Oh, no.
Oh, my God.
Washington!
Washington,
where were you?
I've been pushing
this call button
and staring at my vomit
for two hours.
What's the matter
with you people?
I'm laying
in my own shit.
Why don't you
change the sheets?
This damn place.
I need a bath.
Don't be raising
your voice to me!
You watch your mouth.
Why don't you help me?
What's the matter
with you?
I don't feel right.
I need to see
the doctor now!
He's not available now.
I want to see him now!
He's always too busy.
What's eating
you now?
You going off
the deep end?
We'll amputate that leg,
you go on like this.
Don't put
your hands on me.
I want to be treated
like a human being.
I don't want any of this.
Trying to keep me drugged
so I don't know
what's going on.
This is a fucking slum.
We take that leg,
you're out
in two weeks.
I want my leg.
Why?
You can't feel it.
It's my leg.
I want my leg.
Can't you
understand that?
I want to be treated
like a human being.
I fought
for my country.
I'm a Vietnam veteran!
I fought
for my country!
Shut the fuck up!
I should
be treated decent!
Vietnam don't mean
nothing to me, man,
or any of these
other people.
You got it?
You can take
your Vietnam
and you can shove it
up your ass, you hear?
No! I don't
need this!
Hey, you fuck!
Hey! Hey, goddamn you!
I am a Vietnam
veteran!
This isn't...
Marvin!
Marvin, now!
Marvin!
What's up?
What's up?
Marvin, look!
Oh, fuck!
It's off.
It ain't
going to work.
Start!
Washington,
get the doctor.
Wait a minute.
O.K. Yeah.
All right. I will.
How you doing, Eddie?
Let's see what's
wrong with this.
If we don't get
this pump working,
they'll cut my leg off.
I want my leg.
Do we have another pump?
It's the only one, Eddie.
Ron. It's Ron Kovic.
Sorry, man. Ron.
You... You are a doctor?
It's the Vietnam War.
The government's
not giving us
the money we need
to take care
of you guys.
We're doing our best.
It's really too bad.
It's not fair.
I've tried hard
to keep this leg.
I've been strapped in
this bed for four months
so I could keep this leg.
Maybe I can rig up
a substitute.
I'll look in the basement
and see what we got.
You're coming back?
Soon.
Let go, Ron.
Let go.
We really did try
to help Mr. Kovic.
Aah!
Susanne, he's here.
Ronnie's home.
O.K. Out on 3.
All right, 1...
Oh, that's great.
Did you
paint the house, Dad?
Yeah. I painted it.
Yellow. It looks good.
It looks pretty good.
I got that.
That's all right.
Let's go.
The kids have been
talking about you.
They can't wait
to see you.
It's great to be back
in the neighborhood.
I got it. I got it.
Everything looks
so different.
Major.
Hey, Major.
Major, you know
who this is?
Yeah.
You know who this is?
He's gotten old, huh?
Just like your old man.
Hey, Tommy.
Good to see you.
Look at that hair.
Dad lets you
look like that?
I don't have
much say.
How are you, Jimmy?
Good to have you home.
You're out for good?
I'm out for good.
Patty, gee,
look at you.
Timmy.
That's Jackie.
I wanted to visit you
in the hospital.
How many pull-ups
you do, huh?
You know, I did 23...
I'm O.K. I'm O.K.
I'm all right.
Ronnie.
Susanne.
Good to have you home.
You didn't tell me
she was this beautiful.
She's a woman, huh?
I'm sorry.
That's O.K. I can't
feel anything anyway.
I'm only paralyzed.
You look great.
Yeah?
Ronnie.
Mom.
Ronnie.
Hey, Mom.
Oh, look at your hair.
It looks great.
You like it?
Oh, you look beautiful.
Thanks.
It's good to be home.
It's better
than seeing me
at that hospital, huh?
It's O.K.
I know.
I'm O.K.
I'm O.K.
It's good to
have you home, Ronnie.
Gee, everybody
looks so good.
Everybody looks so good.
I'm going to go inside
for a minute.
Mom, wait.
She'll be O.K.
Ronnie, how are you, man?
You look good.
Ronnie,
you look good.
Welcome home.
It's so good
to see you.
Welcome home.
Nice to see you.
Look at Harry.
You look good.
Let's go in
the house and help.
Come on, Mom.
It's all right.
Looks good.
Yeah?
You need some help?
No. I'm O.K., Dad.
Fixed up a bathroom
for you, Ronnie.
Put a wider doorway in.
I built a shower
for you, too.
You can get in here
pretty easy.
Oh, and I
put some handles
on the toilet
for you.
Ronnie.
Thanks, Dad.
It's really great
to be back in my room.
It's good to have you.
It's good to have you,
Ronnie.
Come on, I'll show you...
I'll show you
some new stuff we got
in the bedroom
over here.
My Happauge Boyer's grossed
My competitor's
rushing in to build,
but I was first.
The people are loyal.
You probably think
it's just a hamburger.
A patty's
just a piece of meat,
but it can
have character.
See that doughnut hole?
Gets 18 patties to the pound
instead of 16.
Saves me
about $40,000 a year.
That's serious
money, Ron.
I plug the hole
with lettuce, tomatoes,
onions, spices.
I cover it
with a pickle.
They'll never
miss a thing.
Give me a good one
for Ronnie. Thanks.
Good job. Try this.
You don't find that
at McDonald's on Sunrise.
I got a drive-in
window, too.
It's Long Island's first.
It's clean,
it's cheap, it's fast.
Feed the family
for $3.95.
Check out these chicks.
They're wearing
those new miniskirts.
It's my idea.
It's good for tips.
The customers
always come back.
Massapequa's changed.
Watch yourself.
It's no mom and pop
operation anymore.
This is our town.
You're doing a nice job.
Keep up the good work.
Good.
Copiague, Ronnie, Jericho,
Bayville, Valley Stream, man.
I want to turn Boyer's
into a whole
Long Island thing.
I want you to come
to work for me.
What can I do?
This is our town now.
You're a war hero,
and you can benefit.
You should benefit,
Ronnie.
You mean, like partners?
We open a place
together?
You got to walk
before you run.
I could start you out
as a cashier.
Then you could
learn the business,
work your way up
to be manager,
just like your dad.
I get 1,700 a month
from the government.
I'll take my time.
That's charity money.
This isn't.
Charity?
Here's your cola.
You got to put
the war behind you.
Forget about
this chair you're in.
Sometimes,
you know, Stevie,
I think people know
you're back
from Vietnam,
and their face changes,
the eyes...
the voice, the way
they look at you.
I know, but people here,
they don't give a shit
about the war.
It's just a million
miles away. It's bullshit.
The government sold us
a bill of goods.
We got the shit
kicked out of us.
What do you mean "we"?
You were in college.
It was you who bought
that Communist bullshit.
Yeah. They were going
to take over the world.
Do you remember that?
Finnelli, you, Walsh.
The whole town
was devastated.
For what?
For lies?
They burn the flag.
They demonstrate
against us
on the cover
of the paper today.
They have no respect.
They have no idea
what's going on
over there
and the men that are
sacrificing their lives.
Nobody here seems to care.
It's a bunch of goddamn shit.
Don't take the Lord's name
in vain.
I agree with
everything you say.
I served my country.
They just want
to take from it.
Love it or leave it.
The other side's angry
because
we're not winning.
How can we win?
Tommy,
what's the matter?
Nothing.
Anybody listening here?
Tommy?
What?
Tommy's going
to fail English.
He doesn't believe
in the war.
What?
He thinks we're doing
the wrong thing over there.
He thinks
it's all a mistake.
Mistake? What's this?
Spit it out.
You believe
in demonstrators?
Huh? What?
I just don't agree
with everything
you're saying.
I don't think
you understand.
What does
Tommy know?
I don't understand?
He's hanging around
with longhairs
who take drugs!
That's not the reason.
Have they ever worked?
You want to
burn the flag?
Huh, Tommy?
What is this?
You want to
bring down this country?
Love it
or leave it, Tommy.
All they're
trying to say, Ronnie,
is they don't
want more people
to come back like you.
That's an easy excuse.
Where were they when
their country needed them?
You served your country.
What did you
get out of it?
Look at you.
Well, look at me.
Look at you, man.
I got to go. I'll see
you around, all right?
What's wrong
with me, Tommy?
What's wrong with me?
Is there something
wrong with me?
I volunteered,
Tommy!
You don't know
what you're
talking about!
Were you there?
You can just love it
or leave it, Tommy!
Mom, I can't believe
what Tommy just
said to me.
I can't...
I can't believe what
Tommy just said to me.
Parade time, Ronnie.
You tell them I'll be
right there, all right?
What kind of car is it?
I think it's
a Continental.
Continental?
A convertible?
Yeah.
They said
it would be.
Coming up
in the world.

Die!
Today is July the 4th,
and I believe in America.
And I believe
in Americanism.
But most of all,
I believe in victory
for America.
Some people are starting
to say the war is wrong,
that we shouldn't be there.
Some people would like to
tear our country down.
But who are the kids
defending their right
to protest?
These are the kids
who care about America,
kids who have respect
for their flag
and their parents
and their government
and their religion.
Kids likeJoey Walsh.
He was the first.
We got a street
in the park named after him.
And Danny Topinka,
Billy Vorsovich,
Phil and Larry Powell,
Tommy Finnelli.
Six boys from Massapequa...
and they all knew
what honor, duty,
and sacrifice meant.
They paid
the highest price.
They died for it.
This town's been hit hard.
It's always been hit hard.
Doc here, he was
in the first war.
A lot of us here
were in the second.
That's why
we can't give up.
That's why we're going to
win in Vietnam.
Because Massapequa's
been there before,
because of those
six wonderful boys,
and because of him.
Ron...
come say a few words,
would you, please?
Ron Kovic,
ladies and gentlemen.
He was born
on the 4th ofJuly, 1946.
Give him a big hand
on his great birthday.
I just want to say
for the guys in Vietnam
that we're doing our best.
It's not an easy situation,
but the boys' morale
over there is real high,
and you can feel
confident that we are...
We are going to
win that war.
I served my country,
and I don't want you
to feel sorry for me.
Do not shed a tear.
I have my hands,
my eyes, my ears...
I have my heart...
and I have...
what I feel...
I have what I feel is...
an unquen... quenchable...
O.K. It's O.K., Ronnie.
It's O.K., kid.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
And we'll
continue to fight
because of guys
like Ron Kovic...
Dad,
where's the car?
It's across the street.
Like he said,
we're going to
win that war.
Ronnie.
Ronnie.
Timmy?
Timmy, man?
Timmy!
I heard you were...
When did you get back?
When did you get out?
Wow, man.
Let's get out of here.
Mr. Kovic?
Yeah. Sure.
Laugh In,
Honey.
Come on.
It's starting.
O.K. I'm coming.
It's the one
with Sammy Davis.
Oh, yeah?
Who else used to play?
Come on, Ronnie.
No. Come on.
Tell me who.
Bobby Moore
at shortstop.
Grady Rogers
at third.
Grady got sick.
It was Finnelli
at third.
Tommy Finnelli.
Yeah.
Got hit with one
of his own mortars.
That's crazy, man.
Yeah, I heard
about that.
Remember the twins,
Phil and Larry Powell?
Oh, the twins. Oh.
They were great
wrestlers.
Oh, man.
They were great.
Tough.
Tough bastards.
When Phil got killed,
Larry...
who wasn't much
for brains either...
went down the next day
and joined up.
Oh, God.
Then he got hit.
Oh, no.
It's true.
A land mine
or something.
He got hit in the head
with a tree.
Yeah. I'm telling
you the truth.
He goes over to Vietnam,
and he gets killed
by a flying
fucking tree.
Oh.
That's really funny.
I think the whole
town got devastated, Ronnie.
I don't think we got
a friend left.
It's really funny.
When did you
get hit, Timmy?
September the 18th.
Near Dong Ha.
A lot of bad shit
up there, Ronnie,
I'm telling you.
Things I don't
even want to talk about.
You know.
I mean, uh...
it was crazy.
Shooting
anything that...
Anything that moved,
you know?
When did you...
When did you get hit?
Me?
Well...
uh, January 20th.
Yes.
Someplace off... I don't
even remember.
Up in the DMZ.
Walked into
a whole battalion of them.
Got shot in the foot.
I got up like I was...
back in the woods again,
like I was
John fuckin' Wayne,
emptying a mag,
screaming,
"Come on, Charlie!
Motherfucker,
come on out, Charlie!"
Rat-tat-tat-tat.
I heard this crack
above my right ear,
and I just
felt my body...
drop out from under me.
Christ, I thought
I was dead for sure.
Was the, uh...
How was
the hospital?
It sucked.
I know.
Really bad.
I'll tell you
something, Ronnie...
sometimes at night...
I get these
headaches, you know?
They're bad.
And, uh...
they just kind of
come over me,
and these doctors
don't know shit,
you know.
They just come,
like I'm going
crazy or something.
I don't feel...
I don't feel like me
anymore, you know?
I feel like...
When they come,
I feel like
somebody else.
What do you do?
Nothing. Not
a thing, you know?
Well... mostly I do
a lot of drugs.
Do anything
you can, you know?
Y-you get through it
any way you can.
When I was
in the hospital,
I thought, "Yeah.
yeah, this makes sense."
What makes sense?
'Cause I failed, Timmy.
What are you
talking about?
'Cause I...
'Cause I killed someone...
some people. L...
I made some terrible...
mistakes.
Ronnie, we all made mistakes.
I mean, you...
you had no choice.
Those pansy
demonstrators
will never understand.
Don't talk about it.
It was insane
over there.
Sometimes I wish...
I wish I'd...
When I got shot
in the foot,
I could have laid down.
Who gives a fuck now
if I was a hero or not?
I was paralyzed,
castrated that day. Why?
'Cause I was so s...
stupid.
I'd have my dick and my balls
now, and I think...
I think, Timmy,
I'd give everything
I believe in,
everything I got...
all my values
just to have
my body again,
just to be whole again.
But I'm not whole.
I never will be,
and that's...
the way it is, isn't it?
For Christ's sake,
Ronnie...
it's your birthday.
You're alive.
You made it.
Smile.

~ Who did you meet ~
~ My blue-eyed son... ~~
Those long letters
I wrote you
from over there?
Crazy stuff, huh?
That's all right.
I had to say everything
I couldn't say
when we were growing up.
They were
beautiful letters.
Yeah?
Yeah.
I wasn't too sure
about the spelling in them.
Who cares
if you can spell?
There was...
there was a lot of feeling
in the words.
I'm so sorry for
what happened to you, Ronnie.
My mom called me
at school and told me.
I was just so shocked.
l... I wanted to...
reach out and help you.
But...
it was just so frustrating,
I just...
stood in the hallway
of my dorm room shaking.
I couldn't say anything.
Donna.
Uh, they need you
over at Locklin.
I can't right now,
Jeff. Later.
Well, don't forget
about the meeting.
Yeah, 9:00?
Yeah. Thanks.
I'm sorry.
You're real busy, huh?
We've got this Kent State
demonstration tomorrow.
I'm on the organizing
committee.
Kent State.
I heard about that.
It was... terrible.
It's terrible.
When I saw that girl
lying in that pool of blood
at Kent State,
I kept on thinking
of that poster
of the children
that were killed at My Lai.
And I kept on thinking
about you over there...
and all the boys
who've died,
who've sacrificed
their bodies and...
and their minds.
The war is
so wrong, Ronnie.
It's so wrong.
I just had to
do something.
~ We don't need arms ~
~ We need hands to hold ~
~ And we
don't need bombs... ~~
Strike now,
shut it down!
Strike now,
shut it down!
Strike now,
shut it down!
You know, Ronnie,
I'm not saying
that you are,
but if you
have any feelings
against the war,
you could really help.
I mean,
you've been there.
You know what it's like.
You could tell people
what's happening,
and they'd really
listen to you.
Remember the prom?
~ Moon river ~
~ Wider than the sea ~
~ My huckleberry friend... ~
Remember that?
Yeah.
~ Moon river for me ~~
Boy, was I crazy
that night.
I just had to
dance with you
before I went in.
It was like I knew.
I made a promise
to myself that
I would come back
and love you forever.
Donna.
Hey, Donna.
Yeah?
The reverend
can't make it tomorrow.
What?
He can't make it.
Oh, Jesus.
What can we do?
Who can we get?
Just let me think.
I'll see you later.
Better hurry.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Ronnie, I got to...
I got to go inside.
Do you want to come?
No, I don't think so.
O.K.
O.K.
Maybe I'll hang around.
Maybe we'll talk later.
All right.
I'll see you later.
We don't want
your stinking war!
We don't want
your stinking war!
All right! Wow!
It's great to be at free
Syracuse University!
We're really getting
an education now, aren't we?
Right on, man!
Right on!
Right fucking on!
Yesterday I was at
Brooklyn College...
NYU. They were both
closed down!
Over 200 high schools
are closed down.
Over 400 universities
are closed down.
It'll be twice that number
by the time...
This is an unlawful assembly.
If you do not disperse...
The people that killed
the kids at Kent State
have names like
General Waste-more-land!
Spiro Agnew!
Tricky Dicky Nixon!
And then we go
to Washington,
confront the war makers
in their own house!
On to Washington!
On to the White House!
I loved this country once.
And all this
I won over there.
Check it out.
Purple heart,
bronze star,
all the commendation
medals,
all the rest
of that garbage.
It don't mean a thing.
Fuck this shit!
This is war!
I said this is war!
They just killed two brothers
atJackson State!
Stand by to gas!
Take them down!
What's going on?
Get out!
Get out of here!
Get out of here!
Get back! Get back!
Donna!
The whole world's
watching!
The whole world's
watching!
The whole world's
watching!
The whole world's
watching!
The whole world's
watching!
The whole world's
watching!
The whole world's
watching!
Donna!
~ Now, when I was just
a little boy ~
~ I stand up
to my daddy's knee ~
~ My papa said, son,
don't let the man get you ~
~ The way that
he done to me ~
~ 'Cause
he'll get you now... ~
He says...
~ No, he'll get you... ~
My machine breaks down,
and they're ready
to cut my leg off.
And that's what the guy...
Now, that's what the guy
in the hospital said.
He said, "You can
take your Vietnam,
and you can stuff it
up your ass."
That's what it's
about in Vietnam.
Hey, Mel!
Double shot of rye,
beer chaser,
sweetheart!
They ain't fighting
the war to win, anyway.
They should
just bomb Hanoi
and get the boys
the fuck out of there.
Four corner hard way.
Vietnam.
Vietnam.
They ought
to write a song
about something
that gets under your skin.
Remember Del Shannon?
~ As I walk along ~
~ I wonder
what went wrong ~
~ To our love ~
~ A love
that was so strong ~
~ Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa ~
~ I'll tell you
what went wrong ~
~ It was Vietnam ~~
It was the wrong war.
Timmy, it was
the wrong war.
Take a shot, will you?
You can take
your Vietnam,
and you can
shove it up yo ass!
Shove it
up your ass, pal.
Is everybody
supposed to feel sorry
because you're in
a fucking wheelchair?
You ain't the only
marine here.
I was on IwoJima.
We lost 5,000 men
the first day.
Don't cry in your
beer to me.
Now, you served
and you lost.
You got to live with it.
You're a marine, man.
Picked them.
They didn't pick you.
Quit your fucking
pissing and moaning.
Timmy, Timmy,
who is this asshole?
I don't know.
Leave it alone.
I think guys...
like you...
are dumb fucking assholes.
That's what I think.
I bet you do, you sorry
son of a bitch.
'Cause you know
if they win,
they win it,
you'll be the first
against the wall.
You know you can't trust
a fucking traitor.
Call me a traitor?
If you weren't
in that chair...
I  in this chair!
Top of the ninth,
Charlie!
You shut up, man!
Come on, Phil,
forget it!
Come on, Ronnie,
he ain't worth it.
Will you come on?
Hey, what's happening?
What's your name?
Jenny.
Penny?
Jenny.
How about going
to Mexico with me?
Mexico?
What do you mean,
Mexico?
I mean,
you're really beautiful.
That's what I mean.
Oh, yeah?
Oh, a really
beautiful place...
The ocean...
The sand, sun.
We could leave tonight.
We could take a plane.
Let's go tonight.
I think you're
really crazy.
Hey, hey, Billy!
Hey, Steve!
What's going on?
Same old shit.
~ Well, I can remember
the 4th ofJuly ~
~ Running through
the backwoods bay ~
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!
I bet you practiced
a lot.
I've got a lifetime
of practice, Jenny.
~ The way that
he done to me ~
~ 'Cause
he'll get you now ~
~ Gonna getcha ~
~ Uhh ~
~ Well,
I can remember... ~~
You O.K.?
You all right?
I don't mean
to laugh.
Shut up, Jenny.
Look at him.
He's fucking shitfaced.
Ronnie?
Ron?
Ronnie?
Give him some room.
Get him out of here.
Give me my chair.
Give me my chair.
I just want to dance.
I just want to dance.
Give me my chair.
Jenny!
Jenny!
I got it.
I got it.
Come on, come on.
Hey, Steve,
let's go. Come on.
Come on.
Steve, come on.
Let's go.
What's going on?
Are you drunk again?
Hey, Mom.
He's drunk again.
Eli, we have
a drunk for a son.
You leave that alone.
You can't stay
in this house.
This is what
you believe in,
but I don't.
I don't believe
in him anymore.
I'll take care of him.
I wish I were dead
like him.
You don't know
what you're saying.
That's the problem.
I'm not dead.
I got to live.
I got to roll around
and remind them
of Vietnam.
You don't want to see us.
You want to hide us
'cause it is a can of shit!
And I am a fucking dummy!
He won't listen.
He won't change.
Take your mom seriously.
You can't drink
in this house.
I believed everything
they told us.
Go fight! Go kill!
Sergeant man,
Marine Corps!
Yo, squad!
Left, squad!
Right, squad, left!
And it's all a lie.
The whole thing
is a bunch of lies!
Stop it! Go to bed!
What did they do to you
in that war?
You need help, Ronnie.
No, you need help,
with all your God
and your bullshit dreams
about me!
You are ashamed of me!
Go to sleep.
You go to bed.
Fuck you!
What did you say
to me?
What did you
say to me?
Mom!
Fuck you!
You'll wake
the whole neighborhood.
Wake them up!
Tell them!
Cusaks! Camelettis!
Walshes!
You tell them all
what they did to me,
what they did
to this whole block,
this whole country.
They'll call the police.
We went to Vietnam
to stop Communism.
We shot women
and children.
You didn't shoot
women and children.
The church
blessed the war.
Communism,
the insidious evil.
They...
they told us to go.
Yes, that's what
they told us.
Thou shall not kill, Mom.
Thou shall not kill
women and children.
Thou shall not kill,
remember?
Isn't that
what you taught us?
Stop it.
Stop it!
Stop it!
I don't want you
in this house.
You're out
of this house.
Ron, you made your point.
No! I haven't
made my point.
You tell her, Dad.
They're killing
everyone now!
I didn't force you to go!
Yes, you did!
And it's all falling apart!
King, Kennedy,
Kent State!
We all lost the war!
It's not my fault!
Communism won.
It's all for nothing.
That's not true,
Ronnie.
How do you know?
What do you know?
Ron.
Will you...
You tell her, Dad!
Tell her it's a lie!
It's a fucking lie!
There's no God!
God is as dead
as my legs!
There's no God!
There's no country!
It's nothing.
It's just me
and this wheelchair
for the rest of my life
for nothing.
Me and this... this...
this dead penis, Mom.
Oh, God! Ronnie!
No, not with
the catheter.
For God's sake, penis!
Eli, I can't
stand it anymore.
To hell with you.
In church
they say it's a sin
if you play
with your penis.
I just wish I could.
Don't say penis
in this house!
Penis!
Stop!
Penis!
Big, fucking erect penis!
Penis! Penis!
He won't let go!
What can I do?
I never got time
to learn how to use it.
It's gone in some
jungle in Asia.
Just gone for...
I'm sorry
it happened this way.
I'm sorry you're sad,
Mom.
I'm so sorry
you're sa-sad.
I'm so fucked up.
Fucked up.
Ronnie...
Maybe a little trip
is all you need.
That place
down in Mexico
you were talking about.
I don't want
to go to Mexico.
I don't want
to go no place.
I don't want
to go no place.
Ronnie...
I think
you should go.
What can I do,
Ronnie?
What do you want?
I want to be
a man again.
Who's going
to love me, Dad?
Who's ever
going to love me?
Who's going to love me?
Hey, you maggots,
ante up 5 American.
Let's go. Ante up.
Ed, you're light.
The game
is seven-card stud,
one up, two down.
One up, two down.
We got a 5, a jack.
That's a joker, a king.
The price of poker
just went up, gentlemen.
Charlie buys a queen.
Charlie,
Two down, two down.
Hey, big blue eyes,
what's your name?
What's that?
What's your name?
Ron Kovic.
Just what we need,
another limp dick.
Where from?
Massapequa,
Long Island.
Guys, say hello
to Ron Kovic,
just in from the States.
Hi, Ron.
Laugh, motherfucker.
You'll get yours.
Fuck you.
Put your hand
right there, baby.
What's your name?
Charlie,
from Chicago.
How long has this game
been going on?
How long
have you been here?
A hundred
fuckin' years.
'Cause I got a gun.
I ain't ever going back.
Fuck the States.
Nobody understood.
Nobody gave a shit.
The fuckin' women
didn't even want
to look at me.
Fuckin' States.
I ain't never
going back.
I want something simple.
Oh, baby,
you're so beautiful.
Ain't she beautiful?
Here we go.
She's beautiful.
Go into town.
Get yourself one.
Fuck the shit out of you,
even if you are paralyzed.
Ain't that right, Martha?
You know what they say.
If you ain't got it in the hips,
you better have it
in the lips.
Don't stay here, man.
Get the fuck out.
You know,
you're really drunk
on this mescal shit...
when you swallow
the worm
and don't even know
you did it.
Last round of betting.
Let's go, maggots.
Are you from
Villa Dulce?
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
We go?
What's that?
Do you want
to go upstairs?
No. No, I'm just
looking around.
I just came in... Yeah!
I'd like to go upstairs.
I'd like to.
Good.
Then come.
Let's do it.
What's your name?
Maria Elena.
Maria Elena?
Hmm,
The money.
I'm sorry.
I don't know
how much...
This...
This is good.
Why don't you
take them off?
No, it doesn't matter.
I can't feel anything.
I was paralyzed
in the war.
Vietnam?
Yes.
You let me see?
No.
I can't.
Oh, yes.
It's no good.
Yes, let me see.
No. Look, please...
The spine was severed.
I have no movement,
no feeling.
There's nothing
down here at all.
Nothing happens.
O.K.
O.K.
O.K.
We're going to have
a good time.
It's going to be O.K.
Hey, man, Kovic.
How was it?
How was it?
~ Ai yi yi yi ~~
Did you get one?
Did you get two?
Banzai, man!
Banzai motherfucker!
She loves you,
right, tiger?
Thanks a lot.
It was great.
Just remember,
keep one hand on her tits
and the other hand
on your wallet.
Paradise!
Right, man?
Whoo!
Can I see this?
It don't mean a thing.
I'll be here tomorrow.
You couldn't keep me away
with a baseball bat.
I'll be here for sure.
Vietnam.
So...
we get married
today, no?
Oh, yeah, yeah.
That would be great.
Yeah.
Hi.
You want to
fuck me, mister?
Hey, guapo,
I give you a blow job?
Hey, mister,
you want me?
Let's go.
I'm going to
fuckin' kill that guy.
I got him once.
I'll kill him now.
You'll see.
I'm serious.
Your body.
I'm just going
to kill him.
I'll kill you!
I'll kill you!
You can't talk to me
like that!
Hey! Charlie!
Get out! Get out!
That bitch thinks it's funny
I can't move my dick!
Fuck her.
I'll kill you!
Fuck all you
Mexican motherfuckers!
You don't like it,
get out!
Fuck your syphilitic mother!
Hey!
Don't touch my friend.
Don't you touch me!
Get the hell out!
Don't come back no more.
I wouldn't be here if
it weren't for that war!
Fuck you!
Fuck all of you!
You sure you told him
the right place, man?
I told him Villa Rosa!
Villa Rosa?
Villa Rosa, señor,
Villa Rosa.
Beautiful place.
Great whorehouse there,
man.
Wait until we get there.
You can get señoritas
with big tits.
That goddamn
fuckin' slut.
That Mexican
scumbag cunt!
I think I saw a sign,
Villa Rosa, Charlie,
How far you going,
taco head?
Look at the meter!
It's rigged!
He's rigged the meter!
Hey, asshole!
Hey, I told you
Villa Rosa!
What are we
going to do now?
Fuck them.
Yeah, sure.
How we going to get
out of here?
Fuck them all.
Fuck the whores.
Fuck the cab drivers.
Fuck Mexico.
Fuck Nixon, fuck Vietnam,
fuck them all.
But how we going
to get out of here?
They made me
kill babies, man.
Little gook babies.
You ever have
to kill a baby?
Yeah. O.K., come on.
We'll get a ride.
We got to get back
to the villa.
Fuck you!
What do you mean, O.K.?
What do you mean, O.K.?
You ever have to kill
a little gook baby?
What the fuck
do you know what I did?
I didn't think so.
I didn't think so.
You're full of shit.
No, you are.
Leave me
the fuck alone!
You're nuts.
The sun is going down.
We got to get out of here.
Don't shit me, Kovic.
You never killed a baby.
You never had to.
You never put your soul
into that war,
never put your soul
on the line.
How the fuck
do you know?
Maybe I killed more babies
than you did!
Maybe I did,
but I don't have
to talk about it!
Why not?
Why the fuck not?
What are you hiding?
What are you,
better than anybody else?
You a hero, maybe?
Got a bunch of medals,
but deep down
you're full of shit!
You never fought.
You weren't even there.
What the fuck do you mean,
I wasn't there, man?
Come on, hero,
come clean.
Why should I?
What are you hiding?
You're the one
that's hiding
here in Mexico.
What are you
hiding from,
you whiny fuck?
Don't shit me!
You never killed
anybody, anything,
did you, Kovic?
Did you?
Ever look at yourself
in the fucking mirror?
Fuck you.
You.
No... you!
Fuck you!
No, fuck you!
Get off me!
Get off me, you fucker!
We need a ride.
O.K.!
You O.K., man?
Fuck you.
You're full of shit.
You don't get it.
You don't get it.
You had a town once,
Charlie,
and a mother and father.
Things that made sense.
Do you remember
things that made sense,
things you
could count on,
before we all
got so lost?
What are we going
to do, Charlie?
What am I going
to do, man?
What am I going to do?
You don't have to worry
about them dogs.
They won't bite.
Y'all get away now.
Get on away!
It's all right.
It's all right.
They're probably just
afraid of that chair.
Mr. Wilson,
I'm Ron.
Thanks for, uh,
for seeing me.
Any friend of Billy's
is a friend of ours.
Well, uh, why don't you
come on in the house?
My wife fixed some chicken,
if'n you want some.
Yes, sir, it was
a real nice funeral.
Marine honor guard
came all the way
down from Atlanta
in their fancy uniforms.
Fired their rifles
up in the sky.
Thank you.
The drums was beating.
'Course it was nothing
like the big war
down here.
But there was Billy
and Bruce... Bruce Crabtree...
Andy Henderson.
And the Rutledge boy,
Lance.
Yeah, Lance.
He was a nice boy.
For the life of me,
I still can't quite
figure that war out.
Why we had to go
all that dang way
to fight it
and why's we had to lose
so many young men.
Can't figure it out.
But we got a proud tradition
here in this town.
Billy's great-grandfather
was at the first Bull Run.
My pa was
over in France in '18.
Don't forget, you were
over in the Pacific in '44.
Guadalcanal.
Is that right?
Yeah. Well, I guess
this family's fought
in every war that, uh,
this country's ever had.
I reckon we're ready
to do it again
if'n we have to.
'Course they never did know
what done happened and all.
There was a letter
from a colonel,
I think it was.
Colonel Moore.
That's right,
Colonel Moore.
He said there was
a bad ambush one night.
Said that Billy
distinguished himself
in the fighting.
He also told us that
Billy died real quick.
That's good
that he died quick.
I was his squad leader.
I didn't know Billy
real well.
He was new,
kind of quiet.
We didn't talk much
to new guys.
He was 19,
is that right?
That's right, 19.
Only son?
Yes, sir.
My only boy.
I think he said
he was married
and you were pregnant?
I remember
the day he was killed.
Uh... it was
a strange day.
We were out on patrol
near a beach area...
and, oh,
it was very confusing.
There was screaming
and firing.
Uh...
It was getting late,
and there were these
children, uh...
these babies...
that we killed
by mistake.
How awful.
And then it...
got really crazy.
And we had to pull back
because the NVA
were coming up on us.
And we got scattered
in the dunes.
People were yelling
at anything,
firing at anything.
And that was when it...
it happened.
I was, uh, confused...
scared.
I raised my rifle
three times...
and... shots...
The body fell
in the dunes.
God, this is...
This is very difficult
for me to say.
We don't have
to hear this, Ron.
But I think I was the one
that killed your son.
I was the one.
I was the one.
I was the one.
What's done is done, sir.
I can't ever forgive you...
but maybe the Lord can.
We understand, Ron.
We understand the pain
you've been going through.
Peace now!
Peace now!
Peace now!
Peace now!
Peace now!
Bring our brothers
home now!
Bring our brothers
home now!
Bring our brothers
home now!
Bring our brothers
home now!
Bring our brothers
home now!
we don't want

Four more years!
Four more years!
Four more years!
Four more years!
Four more years!
Four more years!
Four more years!
Four more years!
Four more years!
Can I break through
your complacency?
Do you have compassion
for the people
suffering in this war?
I'm telling you
this war is a crime!
I'm not as bitter
about my wounds...
Who do you think you are?
Can I help you, sir?
You can't come through.
You can't
come through, sir.
I have a pass.
Who are these people?
You can't stop us!
You can't stop me!
You can't stop me!
Why are you
here tonight?
What do you
have to say?
My name's Ron Kovic.
I'm a Vietnam veteran.
I'm here to say
this war is wrong,
that this society lied
to me and my brothers...
Why don't you
shut up?
Traitor!
What are you,
a Communist?
Is this what we get,
spit in the face?
Is this what we get?
Is this what we get,
spit in the face?
We're never going
to let the people
forget that war!
Four more years!
You're not sweeping it
under the rug
because you didn't
like the ratings.
This wheelchair,
our wheelchairs,
this steel, our steel
is your Memorial Day
on wheels.
We're your Yankee-Doodle
Dandy come home.
We're your
Yankee-Doodle Dandy.
Stop the bombing!
Stop the war!
Stop the bombing!
Stop the war!
Stop the bombing!
Stop the war!
Some sort of scuffle
has broken out
on the convention floor,
disabled veterans
protesting the Vietnam War.
We'll try to
get down there.
Why are they gassing us
in the parking lot?
Why are they fighting us?
Because it's a lie.
The truth is they've killed
a generation of young men.
They have sacrificed
a whole generation
of young men.
Stop the bombing!
Stop the bombing!
Communists!
Communists!
Stop the bombing!
Stop the war!
Stop the bombing!
Stop the war!
Traitor!
Go home!
we don't want
your fucking war!
we don't want
your fucking war!
Get the car!
Get the car!
Shut up!
You're under arrest,
Kovic! Come on!
What?
Shut up!
You're a pig?
You should've died
over there, you traitor.
I don't have balance.
Give me
your hands!
O.K., I'll go
with you!
I'm not
under arrest.
I don't have to...
Hey, take it easy!
Get your hands
behind you!
I'm paralyzed!
Get those cameras
out of here!
Hey!
Hey!
I'm paralyzed!
Get in the car!
Hey!
Hey!
My chair!
My ch...
Stop it!
Tactical line!
Advance and disperse
the crowd!
The whole world's
watching!
Let me go!
You O.K.?
Doc, is he O.K.?
I'm O.K.
How we doing here?
How many fingers
you got?
Your head is cut.
Anyplace else
hurting?
I'm O.K.
Where's my chair?
Where's my chair?
Bring his
chair over!
You're cut
over your eye.
The media's got
to see this.
We heard you
shouted down Nixon.
Eddie was arrested,
they beat Peterson,
O'Malley's
gassed real bad,
and Piscatelli's
got a concussion!
It's a mess over there!
Frankie, bring the
media to the gate.
What?
The pigs are coming!
They're clearing the park!
They've arrested
like 30 people...
O.K., O.K., listen up!
Listen up.
Hey, hey, hey!
We're going
to take the hall back.
You hear?
We're going to the gate,
we're taking
the hall back.
Fall out! Let's move!
we don't want
your fucking war!
we don't want
your fucking war!
we don't want
your fucking war!
Ransom, the feminist,
she's six minutes over.
I've got
theJackson people
breathing down my neck.
Who follows?
It won't
be a problem.
You're next.
Mr. Kovic?
We're just about
ready for you.
Can I get you
anything?
Coke, iced tea?
Let's do it.
O.K., Ron.
It's your time.
It's been a long way
to get here.
Tell them what
it is, Ron!
Come on, Ronnie!
Go get them, man.
For Eddie, man.
Ronnie
for president!
Whoo!
Whoo!
The whole world's
watching. I love you.
All right, Frankie!
I feel good.
Ronnie for president.
Whoo!
Congratulations.
I love what
you're doing.
Clear a path
for me, please.
Stand back.
Thank you.
Coming up top.
What will you
say tonight, Mr. Kovic?
I'm going
to tell the truth.
Any plans
for the future?
I guess we'll see.
Mr. Kovic,
could you please
sign your book?
All righty, coming through!
All right, sweetheart.
Straight on through.
Straight on through.
How does it feel
to address the entire country?
Uh, overwhelming...
An honor...
It's been a long way
for us...
The vets... uh...
Just lately I've felt
like I'm home.
You know?
Like, uh,
maybe we're home.
Welcome home,
Ronnie!
Go get them,
Ron!
