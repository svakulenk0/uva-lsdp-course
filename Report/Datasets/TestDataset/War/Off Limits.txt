ANNOUNCER :
DJ :
Criminal Investigations Detachment.
This is it. This is my life.
The path of my life has led me
to be a fucking cop...
...in the fucking cesspool of the world.
I'd say we just give up
on the motherfucker.
This man's service record
says he's a tunnel rat.
For nine months
I've wanted to meet a rat.
Well, I hope you meet one.
- What's the next name on the list?
- Just head over to the Moo-Lon.
I gotta meet my rat.
Yeah, yeah.
This guy here?
Yeah, this dude  number 10.
Crazy motherfuck.
- He was here?
- Yeah. One hour.
Crazy motherfuck.
Buy cigarette from Plowboy.
Smoking and smoking it.
Fall down.
Get up. Leave.
There. There's Plowboy.
The fucker can run. Out!
ALBABY:
No fucking shit.
Motherfucker.
ALBABY:
Cut him off!
ALBABY:
Slow down, you little fuck!
McGRIFF:
Stand tall, you little fuck!
Why you chase?
I don't know why you deal drugs,
Plowboy.
You could have made
this shithole's Olympic team...
...won some medals
and retired to a palace somewhere.
I no deal. Plowboy farmer.
ALBABY: Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
Must be a fucking pill farmer.
This man. Where is he?
- I don't know. Never see.
- "Never see"? You're full of shit.
- I'm gonna pull your fucking nuts off.
- Hey, easy, Babe.
- Easy? He pull a gun on you?
- Yeah.
- He could've shot you.
- Yeah.
Stand the motherfuck up.
Let me go.
- I'm taking them off.
- Hey, hey, easy, Babe.
Remember the last time
you did that to a national?
All those reports?
- It ain't worth the paperwork.
- I don't give a shit about paperwork.
I want them nuts. I'm gonna throw
them in the fucking sewer.
Think about it. Here I come.
I'm gonna take them...
McGRIFF:
I can't control him, Plowboy.
You better talk to me.
You better talk to me.
Now, do it, Baby. That's it!
Shit.
We got mice.
The meeting of hearts and minds
continues, I see.
Don't give me any shit, Lime.
He pulled a gun on me.
Vietnamese nationals
are outside your jurisdiction.
Well, we're looking for a deserter
who is in our jurisdiction...
...and your cousin here sold him
a laced stick about an hour ago...
...and might know where he is.
Pull his fucking nuts off.
LIME: Maybe I should file a protest
to the commanding officer.
So you can spend the rest of the tours
in the Long Binh stockade.
We gotta talk to him, Lime.
You're welcome to observe if you like.
You allow me that right?
How conveniently you Americans forget
that Vietnam is not your colony.
McGRIFF:
He's at the Kit Kat Club.
Lime, if I was a different kind of guy...
...I'd ask you to marry me.
I simply can't wait.
MAN :
ALBABY: A-Spot 1, over.
No can do, Landlord.
We're heading over to the Kit Kat
to pop a deserter...
...we've been after for three days.
Oh, shit.
Shh, shh, shh. Yeah, come here.
Come on.
It didn't take you too long.
Where you been, pissing off more MPs?
You heard about that, huh?
You two can be a couple of real jerk-offs,
you know that? I mean, tact.
- Who's your friend?
- Oh, it's a dead woman's kid.
MAN 1: Go away.
MAN 2: You're fucked up, man.
- Get the fuck out of my way.
MAN 1: What you doing?
MAN 2:
You'll be seeing me, motherfucker.
Hey, why so glum, Al?
Hey, Top, don't call me Al.
My mama named me Albaby.
A-L-B-A-B-Y.
In respect to her, please.
Looks like a Vietnamese problem.
What are we doing here?
Yeah, it was,
until somebody found this.
Oh, great.
American. Officer.
Found it in her hand. She's a hooker.
.45, the back of the head and bang-o.
McGRIFF:
Anything else?
Not much.
Her name was "Nguyen Tao Giap."
Apparently she's new to the area.
Nobody in the building knows her.
Hey, Top. Let me do that.
Let me do that
because I got 13 brothers and sisters.
Yeah.
A neighbor woman here heard the shot.
She's got something to say.
- Where's she now?
- Talking to the mice.
Oh, Colonel Kitts says to coordinate
our investigation with theirs, by the way.
In the interest of better ally relations.
Who's heading up the investigation
for the mice?
Looks like the American's capacity to
enjoy himself has gotten excessive again.
- Nothing's been established yet, Lime.
LIME: It will be.
I'm sure you'll do everything to prove
it's not an American who did this.
- You're really starting to pain me, Lime.
- Oh,
Lime Green.
Ain't that the color of puke?
ROGERS:
Sergeant.
The neighbor's ready for questioning.
Appears she was with a black GI who
went next door when he heard the shot.
He didn't come back,
but a couple minutes later...
...she saw him leave the building
following somebody.
She thinks it was the killer.
Ask her if she knows the GI's name
or his unit.
Drippy dick.
No name, no unit, nothing. He was only
with her for a couple minutes.
Her short-arm inspection
revealed he had the clap.
Drippy dick.
Yeah, she says he had a real dose.
Tell her to meet me at VD Control
tomorrow at noon.
No. Me got no VD. I'm very clean.
I'm number one blowjob girl.
, miss.
I'm sure you're as clean as a whistle.
Just tell her to meet me.
And, Rogers, no freebies, okay?
McGRIFF:
Do you know this girl?
Do you know this girl?
Have you seen this girl?
Do you know this...? Oh, fuck it.
ALBABY:
Yeah, right. Nobody knows a thing.
But somebody's got some American scrip
in their pocket.
I'll tell you something, man.
Bullshit and science rule the world.
Where did she come from?
Dubuque.
Stockholm.
She ain't from here.
McGRIFF: You know,
that insignia could be total bullshit.
ALBABY:
Yeah.
McGRIFF:
You know who our suspects are?
- Everybody in Saigon.
- Civilians, troops, gangsters, cowboys...
...deserters, refugees, dopers,
black-marketeers.
God...
...I love this town.
I really do.
I'm starting to wonder about you,
my man.
ALBABY: My name is Agent Perkins.
This here's my partner, Agent McGriff.
Now, you men are here...
...for two reasons.
One, is because you're black,
which there ain't no question about.
And two...
...is because you've all recently
been treated for drippy dick.
Dick just dripping.
Shit, I can hear your dicks dripping.
How does it feel?
Black in Nam.
Fucking dick feels
like it's about to drop off.
Boy, y'all some sorry motherfuckers.
We have reason to believe
that one of you... One of you...
...was in the off-limits
soul-kitchen section...
...of Vam Co Dong Street last night
when a shooting occurred.
Now, one of you was there.
We'd like to talk to you
about what you may have seen or heard.
No volunteers?
All right. Stand up and line up against
that motherfucking wall back there.
- Get on up.
McGRIFF: I'll get the girl.
Drippy dick.
Shit.
MAURICE: I don't know why
the bitch is telling fibs.
She ain't got no reason to tell fibs.
MAURICE:
Bullshit.
I been there all night fucking that bitch.
She should be grateful, all that love.
How many times
did you fuck her, Maurice?
Eight, 10 times.
I'm a ho-taming motherfucker.
That bitch won't work
for a week at least.
Bullshit.
She don't have the clap, Maurice,
and you can't piss without a painkiller.
I'm gonna put your ass in LBJ.
I'm sick of this shit.
Hey, then be sick of it, motherfucker.
The only thing I saw last night
was some slant-eyed pussy.
Okay. All aright, all right, all right.
Calm down.
Let me talk to Maurice here.
Oh, shit. What you want, Rochester?
I don't wanna be Rochester.
Maurice, you seem to be overlooking
what fine shape you're in here.
You think I ain't hip to that?
I got my own plan for working this.
Yeah? What plan is that?
MAURICE:
I'm working on it.
And no way does it involve
you two low-rank bohunk motherfuckers.
Who does it involve, Maurice?
A general.
A general.
I want a dude with some jizz
to shelter my ass.
I wanna see a dude with some jizz
to cut me orders out of here.
Now, you want a piece of this?
You fetch my ass a general.
How are we gonna
get you a general...
...if we don't know what
you have to tell him?
I followed the dude
that wasted the bitch.
Now, I know what he looks like.
I know what's his rank
and I know where's his billet.
But we talking here, high-ranking
scrambled eggs motherfucker.
I know not to mess with no dude
with that kind of juice.
Not in this man's army.
So if you motherfuckers
want a piece of this...
...fetch me a dude
with stars on his shirt.
Was the man you followed
an Army officer?
General Reynolds is in Da Nang
until Monday.
Hey, that's cool.
That's cool. I'll wait.
But I ain't going back to my unit.
How's that?
I want a weapon...
...and I wanna stay
in a safe house, off-campus.
Somewhere downtown
in the soul kitchen.
I don't trust no motherfuckers
at this point.
Now, don't give me what I want...
...and I'll get total
motherfucking amnesia, dig?
I seen that shit on ,
understand?
You get that shit
and you don't remember nothing.
Those are my terms.
Nonnegotiable, power to the people.
Fuck the people. Power to Maurice.
I'm not staying with the fool
because I'll wind up killing him.
- Mr. Rogers.
- Mr. Rogers.
Hey, man. Why don't we get us
some dope delivered up here?
Man, you nervous enough
without that stuff.
Then let's get some bitches up here
and have a party.
I doubt the VD Control
would approve you, Maurice.
Shit.
You know, you sure
is one square motherfucker.
McGriff and Perkins gonna drop off
some food for us in a little while.
Maybe they'll party with you.
Yeah, right.
Those two bohunk motherfuckers.
Hey. Now, that's happening.
MAN :
-
MAURICE: Oh, watch this shit here.
MAURICE:
They're coming to waste my ass.
Man, would you put that thing away?
The power goes out all the time
down here.
Come on, motherfuckers.
Come on and get me.
ROGERS:
Phone's dead too.
I can't take this spook house shit at all.
Shh! Be quiet.
Sergeant McGriff?
Perkins?
Biggest fucking game of the year,
Alcindor versus Hayes...
...and I can't get it on AFVN.
Holy shit.
- Are you all right, man?
- Yeah.
- Oh, shit.
ROGERS: I think it was the sappers.
They sprayed us with...
SOLDIER:
Hold it right there, motherfucker.
- Sure you're all right?
- Yeah. Go ahead.
Just call the medics, man. I'm all right.
Do you see him?
I can't tell.
Are they up there?
- Which way? Which way, goddamn it?
- I don't know.
There they are. Hit it. Hit it.
ALBABY: Look out! Get out of the way!
McGRIFF: Don't do it!
Cocksuckers!
Goddamn insect motherfuckers. Shit.
MAN:
Okay, slight disorientation here.
Just have him go inside and if he
needs an analgesic, give it to him.
But if not, keep him off morphine.
This guy goes to OR 1.
What's the status in OR 1?
- How's he doing?
- They won't let you in there.
Some VC asshole threw a satchel bomb
in a movie theater up in Chau Long.
- They're kind of busy.
- We shouldn't have left him.
Concussion wound.
You couldn't have known.
I'm gonna go see how he's doing.
What a fucking mess.
WOMAN: You, out of here.
- Yeah, yeah.
He okay?
Did you get a look at his assailants?
Did you get to look at them?
Yeah.
They were slopes.
Gooks.
Little tiny slant-eyed VC motherfuckers
with Hawaiian shirts.
Somehow I find it hard to feel sorry
for you losing one friend...
...when hundreds of Vietnamese
are dying each day.
But then I suppose American
is a study in self-possession.
I should remember that.
I could pop your head like a pimple
before they get off a single round.
DIX:
McGriff.
You guys, get out.
Your passion is misdirected, sergeant.
The men who killed your friend
work for the same people you do.
DIX:
That's an order.
I found out
what that was all about in there.
Lime says CID had this case before
and suddenly dropped it.
He says there's been six
of these murders...
...and there's someone high up
on our side covering them up.
Man, that is such bullshit.
You know, that's typical
South Vietnamese paranoid bullshit.
If there was an
investigation before...
...it would've been in our files
and it wasn't.
Well, he also said those two guys
you chased were not VC.
He says they're working
for the same folks we're working for.
That's crazy.
Rogers gets put in for a Purple Heart
just like everybody else in there.
Go home and get some rest.
Both of you.
Hey.
I'm glad it didn't get
any worse in there.
I'm not.
We'd have done all right.
McGRIFF:
Right back to square fucking one.
WHORE:
Hey, you.
Dead girl baby no mine.
You take orphanage.
Take Sacré Coeur.
- No mine. Fuck you.
- Hey. Hey.
Lady.
Goddamn it.
WHORE:
Go away!
Lady, let me in.
I live in a fucking billet.
- Shut the fuck up. It ain't funny.
- It ain't?
You probably got 10 kids of your own
scattered all everywhere...
...and now you finally got one
you got to take care of.
Just drive to the orphanage, will you?
- Oh! Ah!
- I was hoping that would happen.
I believe this one participated
in our night-care program.
Night care, Mother?
Sister Nicole initiated a program
to take care of prostitutes' children...
...while their mothers were at work.
Before that, the work
was sometimes performed...
...with the child sleeping
in the very next bed.
I see.
These murders,
they've become almost epidemic.
Mother...
...we're kind of new on this case.
How many murders do you know of?
Six or seven.
Perhaps more.
Did you know
this child's mother personally?
No. Sister Nicole may have.
She does social work with many
of the prostitutes and bar girls.
Could we speak with Sister Nicole?
If we can find her.
She's always so busy.
These are the six victims
we are aware of.
Sergeant?
It's just you look different
in your uniform, Sister.
I find that wearing my habit
can be quite off-putting to people.
Sometimes I don't wear it
when I work in the community.
The common link you are looking for
is obvious even in these photographs.
The murdered women's children
were all Amerasian.
The mothers worked in the officers' bars
mostly, where the money is highest.
This is Dang Kao Lanh.
She was killed almost a year ago.
Her speciality was sadomasochism.
Bondage.
This is Nguyen Chi Diem.
She specialized in oral sex.
The men at the American officers' club
would line up for her.
Ngo Van Dinh and her little boy.
December.
She worked for a pimp
who put her in the lesbian shows...
...on Vam Co Dong Street...
...and he cheated her every day.
Sergeant?
You're very worldly for a nun, Sister.
I'm trying to help you
as much as I can, sergeant.
I was very close
to some of these women.
I want to see the killing stopped.
DIX: Jesus Christ, officer. Now, what
the fuck are we meeting here for?
McGRIFF: The dead girl had a picture
of herself taken in front of this place.
Where have you been?
It's almost midnight.
I had to go to USARV HQ.
Just got back.
Look.
Victims.
Not one, but seven.
I guess our pal Lime
was at least half right.
This shit's been going on
for over a year now.
All the victims are between 17 and 22.
And all of them have babies
by American daddies.
I know.
Lime may be all the way right.
CID did have this case before.
We dropped it six months ago.
Bang. Like that.
Hey, let's get out of here.
Who's he?
DIX:
Colonel Kitts. Recognize the name?
You work for him.
BAND LEADER:
Being almost 12:00...
...I like everybody join
in welcoming Vietnamese New Year.
Also welcome Tet cease-fire...
...and offer good will, all men.
All men except Charlie.
Five, four, three...
- Goddamn officer class.
...two, one.
Wouldn't surprise me if any one
of these pricks is a fucking girl-killer.
They say the investigator that was on it
was one of our Marine cousins.
He was transferred out
and that was the end of it.
McGRIFF: What do you know?
DIX: Goddamn fireworks.
ALBABY:
Didn't anybody ask any questions?
DIX:
No.
Hey, so there are a few dead whores.
Haven't you seen a suspect village after
an air strike? Men, women, kids. Shit.
Hey, we're in a war zone, girls.
Is the other agent still in country?
Yes, with the 26 Marine,
Jesus Christ.
They transferred him to that shithole.
Weirder.
He's up there at this own request.
What's his story?
His name's Flowers.
Staff Sergeant Elgin Flowers.
Hey, that's all I know.
- We gotta talk to this guy.
- Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah, Khe Sanh.
Get your asses shot off.
Hey, Top, it's Tet. We got a cease-fire.
Don't worry about it.
SOLDIER 1:
Get down! Incoming!
SOLDIER 2: Keep it low! Keep it low!
McGRIFF: Cease-fire?
ALBABY:
This ain't no fucking cease-fire!
Goddamn!
Oh, shit!
Damn. Jesus fucking Christ.
McGRIFF:
Bullshit.
Motherfucker, you knock over my chow,
I knock over your life.
- Man, fuck you. Shit.
SOLDIER 3: Son of a bitch.
Why don't you save that animosity
for Charles out there?
We're looking
for Staff Sergeant Elgin Flowers.
PREACHER:
Flowers?
McGRIFF:
He's supposed to be in this bunker.
Now, what you wanna see
Mr. Flowers for?
Flowers' mama
don't even wanna see him.
Where's Flowers?
Lieutenant let Flowers
dig his own house.
You keep going until you get
to the end of this here trench line.
Flowers' house
is maybe 20 meters beyond that.
Hey, y'all can't miss it.
Flowers got his mojo working there.
SOLDIER 4:
Yeah, get that voodoo shit working.
It's on a stick.
SOLDIER 5: Close the door, motherfucker.
SOLDIER 6: Hey, fuck you, asshole.
McGRIFF:
Fuck.
ALBABY:
Come on.
Move a little faster, baby?
McGRIFF:
Relax. We got a cease-fire, remember?
MAN:
Who the fuck goes there?
Joint services, CID, Saigon.
- You here to waste me?
ALBABY: Ease up.
Nobody here to waste you.
Flowers.
We only wanna talk.
FLOWERS:
Everything's going along fine...
...until I get it narrowed down
to like five suspects.
Then my life starts
getting bi-fucking-zarre.
These five suspects,
were they officers?
I'm off the case.
Go read the files.
There ain't no files.
Somebody took them.
Fellas...
...why don't you build yourselves
some nice little trenches out here...
...like me?
Life becomes so simple.
Just you...
...and the fucking war.
McGRIFF:
Goddamn it, Flowers.
No one from channels
knows we're up here.
Just tell us what you know
and we'll leave.
Go away. I got work to do.
Fuck this. This is not gonna happen.
I'm gonna find us a hooch to sleep in.
Kiss my ass, huh?
These are pictures
of the dead women's kids.
They're just regular kids...
...but now they're alone
in the middle of this mess.
I'm alone in the middle of it too,
aren't I?
Flowers...
...we need your help.
Fuck them.
SOLDIER 1:
Jim, are you okay?
- You over there?
SOLDIER 2: Yeah, I'm fine.
Not much incoming.
McGRIFF:
Wait till the plane gets here.
There's our bird.
SOLDIER 3:
Oh, God, help me, please.
Oh, Father.
- It's Flowers. Give me your hand.
FLOWERS: Hey, asshole!
- Hey! Hey!
McGRIFF: Come on, man.
Come on, you can make it!
Come on!
- Come on!
- Fuck you!
You're guilt-trip assholes!
Guilt-trip motherfuckers!
Fuck you!
Fuck you, assholes!
McGRIFF:
These are his suspects.
ALBABY:
Five of these motherfuckers. Ooh.
It's the fucking boss man.
Surprised nobody's
fragged his ass by now.
Who the fuck is she?
McGRIFF:
A victim that got away.
Her name is Nguyen Tri Quan.
Jesus Christ. He had an eyewitness?
Then how come
there's still five suspects?
Well, she ran off
before he could show her these pictures.
These are the only colonels who were
in town on the nights of the murders.
Good work.
I'll mention your names
when it goes upstairs.
- Wait.
ALBABY: What do you mean, "upstairs"?
Now, this ain't a thing for you.
- This is an officer thing.
- It always was an officer thing.
Not a colonel officer thing.
You realize how much punch
these cocksuckers have in a war zone?
Yeah. Like goddamn royalty.
And we gonna throw
one of them in jail.
KITTS: You work for me?
- Sir?
Do you work for me?
Yes, sir.
Get a haircut, son.
You're not in the field.
You're in Saigon.
Let's get some air.
DIX:
Gook whores.
I mean, you don't
really give that big a shit.
Come on, Top.
We may have lost a man over this.
Besides, it happened on our beat.
Your beat? Your beat?
You're floating in a big sea of shit.
And instead of just staying in the boat...
...no, you reach out and you pick up
this one little turd and you say:
"This turd?
Well, this turd pisses me off.
I'm gonna do something
about this turd."
Christ.
- Been here too fucking long.
- Oh, fuck it.
All right, I've made my speech.
If you're gonna pursue this...
...you better do it smart.
No more reports.
You send nothing through channels
till you get this fucker cold.
Who hates typing more than we do?
You guys...
...a couple of real fucking
Gary Coopers, huh?
Just don't come crying to me
when this turns to shit.
And it could, believe you me.
Yes, Nguyen has an infant child here...
...but we haven't seen her
for several months.
No one has.
She just disappeared?
Does she have any family or friends
that might know where she went?
She has a sister, Lanh.
She works at the stripping place on
the corner of Thieu and Tu Do Streets.
The Pink Pu...
The Pink Pussy, sergeant.
We know it well.
Thank you, Sister.
We'll talk to Lanh
and see what she knows.
NICOLE:
Sergeant.
I don't think Lanh will talk to you.
She's quite political.
She doesn't like Americans.
Is she VC?
She's political.
I'd be happy to talk to her if you'd like.
I think we'd better
question Lanh ourselves.
But maybe you could come with us,
smooth things over.
I would have to ask mother superior.
No, sergeant.
We always travel in pairs, like you.
So who gets the pretty one
on this here double date?
That's Lanh on the stage now.
I figured we could wait backstage.
No, no, a table will be fine.
Yeah, that will be fine.
Are you uncomfortable, sergeant?
You're a nun, Sister.
Do you think we could do this work
if something like this shocked us?
I guess not.
I do not talk Gls.
Gls kill my brothers.
They make fuck-things
of my sisters.
They have big party in Vietnam.
Lanh, I know about
a half a million Gls...
...who would just as soon quit the party
and go home, believe me.
Lanh, if these men
can talk to Nguyen...
...they feel they can arrest the man
who's killing the girls.
Will you help them?
Nguyen leave when colonel tries kill.
She changed.
She no more want to be fuck-thing.
She became a patriot now.
Hey, miss, we don't give a shit
what your sister's politics are.
You know, we're just trying
to conduct a murder investigation.
Hanoi. You look Hanoi for Nguyen...
...if you can get airplanes
stop bombing long enough.
McGRIFF:
Thank you, Sister.
NICOLE:
I'm sorry we were not of more help.
So, now, you're a novice.
When do you become a full-fledged nun?
- I take my final vows in two weeks.
- I see.
I do intend to take them,
Sergeant McGriff.
Of course.
I was just curious.
I should go.
Perhaps there are others I can ask
about Nguyen's whereabouts.
Sister, this is my card.
If anything comes up...
...please call.
I would like to apologize
for something.
I enjoyed making you uncomfortable
in that club.
Some part of me did it on purpose.
I'm not sure why.
It's okay.
ANNOUNCER :
- Go. Beautiful. Cool.
I've seen him do it 100 times,
the big man.
He heads towards the hoop...
...as he's going up, he feeds off
to Allen, two points. Beautiful.
Oh, I'm so happy.
- Yeah. You got a crush.
- No.
Hey, man, this is me you're talking to.
I see the way you watch her.
You got a crush.
I think one of the sappers
who wasted Rogers is following us.
Nice day for a walk.
You know, we gotta take
this little motherfucker alive.
Stand tall, you little fuck.
- Drop the weapon, asshole.
SAPPER: No!
McGRIFF:
Drop the gun, you...
Who do you work for, pal?
Speak to me.
I think we should pull
his fucking nuts off.
- You better go on home, boy.
- Fuck you, America!
You're lucky that didn't hit me
in the foot.
I'll come back here and fuck you up.
McGRIFF:
Where's he coming from?
McGRIFF:
You see him?
Where is he?
I think he's up here.
I thought I saw him up here.
McGRIFF:
Forget it!
We better call for a backup. Come on.
ALBABY:
No shit.
McGRIFF: Back off.
ALBABY: Move out of the way!
Put that stick down.
Get in the car.
We gotta get out of here.
Get off the car!
MAN: Fuck you.
- Put that fucking rock down.
Put the rock down!
Get in the fucking car!
Fuck you. Fuck you.
I'm gonna pop you.
I'm gonna pop you.
You've finally succeeded
in killing a Vietnamese national, I see.
No, Lime, that's not what happened.
He's lying in the street.
His poor mother is weeping over him.
Did he commit suicide?
Disperse the pissants
and then we'll talk.
I'm placing you both under arrest.
Get out of the car with your hands up.
McGRIFF:
We didn't do it, Lime.
We won't leave the car until the natives
are back in their grass huts.
Hand over your weapons
and get out of the car. Now.
McGRIFF:
You wanna give him the satisfaction?
Rather die.
- May have to.
- I said, I'd rather die.
We won't leave
unless we go as brother cops.
No cuffs, no arrest.
You shake our hands,
we get out of the car...
...you congratulate us
and tell us we're cool.
We arrested one of the cowboys
who wasted Rogers.
Someone popped him as we
were trying to load him into the car.
Yeah, so now Napoleon here
wants to arrest us...
...just so he can impress
his fans around here.
We have an angry crowd here,
sergeant.
The dead man apparently
lived in the neighborhood.
I don't give a shit if he lived
at the Presidential Palace.
My men are coming with me.
I'm afraid this crowd won't allow it,
sergeant.
Fuck the crowd. Let's go.
I'm afraid me and my friends
won't allow it either.
Our credibility
is very much at stake here today.
Fuck your credibility.
You're outgunned today, sergeant.
Goddamn, when will you people learn?
We're never outgunned.
DIX:
Give me the Air Con frequency.
Clipper Ship 3,
this is Paste Pot 1, over.
PILOT :
Roger that. You see the guy standing
next to me in that lime green ascot?
Put the blade at M60
right over his heart. Hold it there.
You despise me
because you think I am corrupt.
In reality, you're too innocent to see
corruption right before your eyes.
Your only real danger
lies from those above you.
Yeah! Yeah!
ALBABY: It's the record jackets
on the suspect colonels.
Where did you score this shit, Dix?
DIX: A real top buddy of mine
down at USARV.
You can count two of those guys out,
by the way.
ALBABY:
How's that?
There was only three in town
on the day of the last murder.
Which three?
Well, Kitts, the guy you work for,
Scott, guy in your hand...
...and this sweetheart here.
Look at the mug on him.
Fucking guilty. Guilty.
Citadel, West Point...
...commendations,
future fucking joint chief.
Yeah. Not only is he one of the youngest
full birds in any branch...
Total animal.
- But he's married
to a Vietnamese woman...
...and he had a child by her
a couple years ago.
Now, the wife and kid were killed
in a mortar attack out near Can Tho.
That's about 13 months ago.
Just about the time
the murders started.
Sounds just about twisted enough
to be right, doesn't it?
He'll be in town next Thursday morning,
by the way.
Brass got him talking
in the 5:00 follies.
We're gonna be on your ass
like stink on shit, motherfucker.
Gentlemen, Colonel Dexter Armstrong...
...chief of staff, 13th Infantry Division.
Presently stationed at firebase Conrad
near Can Tho.
Good morning, gentlemen.
I'm here to dispel
some of the gloom and doom...
...running rampant in the press since
the beginning of Charlie's Tet Offensive.
I work down near Can Tho
and I can tell you, personally...
...a lot of what I've been reading
is plain bullshit.
Take a look at the map.
All right, my backyard
starts about here...
...runs here across here
approximately up to here.
And in my backyard, we run the show
both day and night.
Where I was raised, we used to say:
"Never write a check with your mouth
you can't cash with your ass."
So if any of you
don't buy what I just said...
...come on down,
take a look for yourself.
I'm telling you, I could be in love
with this woman.
Where does she come from?
From God.
She a tea girl?
Yeah, I met her at the Memphis Pride.
This woman had
the biggest tits and nipples...
...that I have ever had in my mouth.
You gonna eat that shit?
No, I'm gonna fuck it.
There's our boy.
ALBABY:
Ooh.
Looks like my man got his ass
a little twinight double header.
McGRIFF:
Check it out.
Let's get on it.
DRAGON LAD Y:
Francine, come on.
Come on.
Come on.
I'm gonna go up the other end
and work my way back.
ARMSTRONG:
Are you frightened, Francine?
No sounds, Francine.
SOLDIER: Well, well, well.
Got us a peeping Tom here, Mackey.
You get an eyeful, motherfucker?
McGriff, CID.
- I understand you wanna talk to me.
McGRIFF: Yes, sir.
But first I'd like to know who gave
these men orders to bring us here.
These men are my children.
They'd open you up
and eat your liver if I told them to.
I'm their CO and they love me.
Uncuff them.
Put them in.
Fire it up, son.
Sir, we're conducting
a murder investigation.
Saigon prostitutes. Six of them.
- You're a suspect, sir.
- I know. I'm also busy.
- Lift off.
PILOT: Okay, sir.
So you think I'm a goddamn murderer.
We're just trying
to conduct an investigation.
Oh, shut the fuck up.
I'm conducting something
of an investigation here myself.
These VC assholes
have information I need.
I'll interrogate them
as you interrogate me.
Me them, you me. Got that?
- Colonel, I...
ARMSTRONG: Shut the fuck up.
Bring me a gook.
That down here is goddamn Vietnam.
No!
Start asking your questions.
McGRIFF: Sir, don't you think...?
- Start now.
Where were you on the night
of January 28th of this year?
City of Saigon,
Republic of South Vietnam.
Ask him where the supply dump
for the 58th NVA Division's located.
Interrogate me. Don't stop.
McGRIFF:
What were your exact whereabouts...
...in Saigon at approximately
...on January 28th?
Tell him I'll throw his ass out,
he doesn't talk to me.
I was with my little fuck-bitch
at the Continental Hotel.
We do a sadist trip together
with the little girls.
My little fuck-bitch
gets off better than I do.
Unlatch his hands.
Tell him if he can throw me off
this aircraft, he's a free man. Faster.
Ask your questions faster or I'll have
him throw your ass out of here.
Where were you on the nights
of January 28th...?
What the fuck...?
Bring me another gook.
My unit is the most decorated unit
in country.
We have the highest body count
of any unit in Vietnam.
Ask the little fuck
where the 58th Division is.
If you two don't start asking me
some pertinent questions...
...I'm gonna goddamn court-martial
your asses right here, right now.
Have you ever murdered any prostitutes
in the city of Saigon?
ARMSTRONG:
No, I have never killed a prostitute.
I pinken girls' asses with a riding crop.
That's my little trip.
Only now, you two assholes
are gonna put it in your report.
My career will be fucked
for all eternity.
I have never killed a whore.
And I'm gonna prove it to you
beyond a shadow of a doubt.
Ask him the same.
Another fucking bullshit artist.
Now, that man may have been
a bullshit artist...
...but I admired him.
He didn't whimper.
I don't whimper either.
I walk it like talk it.
Now, if I killed a prostitute,
I will stay in the aircraft.
If I did not, I will jump. You got that?
ALBABY:
Shit.
Oh, Christ. Put your hands up.
I said, get your fucking hands up.
You killed the goddamn colonel.
- We didn't kill him. He fucking jumped.
McGRIFF: We're CID.
The colonel was under investigation
for multiple civilian murders in Saigon.
He committed suicide. Just ask him.
Colonel Armstrong wild-fuck
son of a bitch. He jump out.
- We're going back to the firebase.
- Like shit we are. They'll waste us.
McGRIFF:
Take us to the MPs in Saigon.
Either that or you shoot us here.
It's your call, pal.
Jesus Christ, the goddamn colonel.
The shit's gonna hit the fan.
We're gonna have shit
all over the fucking place.
DIX:
Now you two are in big fucking trouble.
ALBABY:
Why is that?
DIX:
Keep it down till we get outside, huh?
SOLDIER:
You sorry assholes.
Took some doing
but I got you released to my custody...
...because they're all waiting for
General Bower to get back from Guam.
- And the rumors are flying.
- What kind of rumors?
How you forced the colonel
to take a plane ride...
...so you could grill his ass
till he killed himself.
Right. Meantime...
...the crazy motherfucker's
body-bombing VCs and killing whores.
- The man was guilty.
- All right. The game plan is this:
We go over to the office,
I get your depositions.
We'll get you to your billets, get your
shit, get on the plane out of here.
What do you mean, "out of here"?
Your traveling papers, girls.
Just came through.
You report to Fort Ord, California,
Monday, 0800 hours.
ALBABY:
What?
Somebody fucked up. They're rotating
you a couple of weeks early.
What, you looking a gift horse
in the ass?
Shouldn't we be here to defend ourselves
when they start the investigation?
That's what the deposition is for.
It turns out Armstrong
is like young Jesus around here...
...and the brass is mightily pissed.
In a couple days, they'll get used to it.
Until then, they're looking for blood.
They don't care whose.
You're leaving. Orders is orders.
Well, it's a duffle-bag drag.
When I was looking
through Armstrong's Form 20...
...I noticed he was a young lieutenant
back in Korea.
We had the same thing
going on over there.
Hookers being killed?
Yeah, same m.o.
Went unsolved back then.
Wouldn't surprise me
if it was the same guy.
- Ready?
- Yeah.
Look...
...I'd have got you something better,
but it all happened pretty quick.
- I'll open mine right now.
DIX: Go ahead.
Lord have mercy.
Hey, look, don't bite any stews' rumps
on the way home.
I got you on a commercial flight.
Thanks, Dix.
Not for this.
- It was a good tour.
DIX: Yeah, our paths will cross again.
I only got six months left
in this shithole myself.
Maybe I'll put in for Ord, huh?
Take the next right up here.
What you wanna do?
Give her a kiss goodbye?
Just wanna tell her it's all wrapped up
and say so long.
She was a good Joe.
Sister?
Lanh. The dancer we visited.
She was...
...killed last night.
How did it happen?
The same as the others.
Only this time he killed the child.
No, please.
I'm sorry, Sister.
I thought it was over.
DIX: You two will be picking up
where Perkins and McGriff left off.
I'll be working close with you
because now I'm pissed off.
The files of this mess are over at HQ.
Just get your asses
over there right now.
Son of a bitch.
When did this come in, Dix?
About a half an hour after you left.
McGRIFF: Who are these guys?
- The new investigators.
- You guys are out of here.
- Not yet, we're not.
You miss that flight
and you are AWOL.
You got 40 goddamn minutes.
Come on, get.
Hey, take these two to Tan Son Nhut
and stick with them.
Goddamn it. Can't you see?
Someone sped up those orders
because of what we're working on.
That is either true or it is not.
In either case,
I'm the one that's gotta deal with it.
You are enlisted men and they can
put you in fucking jail. Move them out!
McGRIFF:
I'm coming.
Oh, man, fuck them insect hookers.
I refuse to give a shit.
We weren't doing it for them.
We were doing it for us.
To give it all
some kind of fucking meaning.
Leaving this place outside a plastic bag
is all the meaning I need.
Get down!
Hey. Hey.
Jesus.
I was hit.
Am I gonna be all right?
Am I gonna be all right?
I want... I wanna sit up.
I wanna sit up.
Jesus.
The little fuck is coming back.
ALBABY:
He's coming back?
What's he coming back for?
- What's he coming back for?
McGRIFF: Get down!
What the fuck
are you coming back for?
Hey! What you coming back for?
What the fuck
are you coming back for?
You motherfucker.
Go ahead on.
MP 1: Hey, they had a prisoner.
Just put it down.
- Clear the streets, Neil.
MP 2: Spread out.
MP 1:
Get this gun out of here.
Come on, let's go. We're walking.
- You're dead now, you motherfucker.
MP 1: Put him in the back.
ALBABY:
I ain't dead.
Fucking gook motherfucker.
I'm talking to you.
What happened to you?
Somebody on our side tried to kill us.
I had no place to go.
What time is it?
It's almost 9.
How badly are you hurt?
I'm okay.
I'm worried about my partner.
I know where Nguyen is.
I have known.
I take her child to her
every two weeks.
Why didn't you tell us?
I was sworn to secrecy.
Where is she?
She is with the Vietcong near Cu Chi.
Will she talk to us
now that her sister's been killed?
She believes she will also be killed
if she comes to Saigon.
Can I go to her?
Why not, Sister?
You know these people.
You could tell them
what we're trying to do.
You're an American soldier. Do you have
any idea the hatred they have for you?
Doesn't anyone give a fuck
but me and my partner?
Please, just hold me.
I'm sorry, Sister.
This world is so insane.
ALBABY:
What a play!
UCLA with the ball again.
Alcindor's at the top of the key.
He wants it. He wants the ball.
He's got it!
Two men on him. Fakes left.
Oh, what a move!
That's the win.
He gets his own rebound.
He fakes again.
Gorillas the ball and two points.
Two points.
He's fouled on the play.
The crowd's going wild.
Big man's gotta make two.
Two to win the game.
He sets.
He shoots.
He misses.
Are you all right?
Nothing can hurt the big man.
How'd you get away?
Medics took off my cuffs.
Big man made a fast break...
...and he ran and he ran and he...
You didn't hurt anybody, did you?
Does big man wanna go for a ride?
Where?
Where we always been going.
Swish.
He says he can only get through
the checkpoints for a short time.
Sergeant McGriff?
ALBABY:
I'll spit in your fucking face.
All right. All right. Stop shoving me.
Stop shoving me. Shit.
I'm going.
Chickenshit motherfucker.
Oh, Jesus Christ.
We're gonna fucking die down here.
Oh, my God.
McGRIFF:
Nguyen.
We've narrowed it down to two men.
Which one?
No here.
Now, you look at these pictures.
Look at these pictures. It's one of these.
- Just...
- No.
There.
This man here?
This man here? Lime Green.
Not Viet man.
GI here.
This picture old.
He colonel now.
Have ugly mark on arm.
ALBABY: Oh, man. Where the fuck
we gonna find him now?
McGRIFF:
Oh, Jesus.
Shit.
He was an officer himself once,
you know.
He performed a series of heroic acts
back in Korea.
He was recommended
for a field commission...
...to the rank of second lieutenant.
But then his regimental commander
saw his...
His tattoo.
Very working class.
It so offended
his regimental commander...
...that his field commission
was never sent through.
DIX:
I've sinned.
Hear my confession, Sister.
Like a priest.
Dix's regimental commander
was married to a Korean woman.
Typical.
Whore.
But he did love her.
Yeah, boy.
Killing her was the only way...
...to truly make him feel
the kind of pain that Dix felt...
...by being cheated
out of his commission.
There were a few more after that.
Pow. Pow.
ALBABY:
Get out of the fucking way!
Then he behaved.
For years, he behaved.
One dog-eared noncom barracks
after another.
ALBABY:
They gotta be up top.
They gotta be.
Dix's pain wouldn't just go away...
...no matter how many whores
he killed.
Goddamn you!
If it wasn't for you,
they never would have found him.
McGRIFF:
Dix. Enough.
How did it go?
It was really beautiful.
You should have come in.
No, man.
I ain't into that voodoo shit.
California.
- You ever been there?
- Yeah.
- You?
- No.
Different.
ALBABY:
You know who I got a letter from?
McGRIFF: Who's that?
ALBABY: Remember that sweet thing...
...I met at the Memphis Pride?
With big tits and huge nipples?
So she writes me a letter
and she starts it off:
"My sweet Albaby...
...I love you too much."
McGRIFF: "Love you too much."
ALBABY:
Peace.
