Memories of Corrie Ten Boom,
endured the darkness...
The Hiding Place
Haarlem, Holland - Spring 1940
Oh.......
Coffee...
In the parlour.
Good Morning Mr.Ten Boom.
I appologize for the intrusion.
- They are collecting all radios.
- I can see that.
And Dutch Police men assisting them !
We do what we must.
- The radio is ?
- Upstairs in the Parlour !
Get it.
You have many beautiful clocks here.
Bávaro ?
The cabinet looks like
Sir Berringer's works.
Yeah, 1886.
You know watches,... clocks ?
My Father is a watch maker.
I grew up in Reuverswinch.
You look what you have grown into.
- What District ?
- Mattenbraw.
Mattenbraw...
Mattenbraw, 1895.
- Magnificient.
- But you should have seen that watch...
When it was taken in.
The way some people treat a watch
No care... No....
understanding.
It was a gift on my 70th
Birthday.
" To Grandpa Ten Boom,
- From the Children of Haarlem.
Give him the horn.
- Any other radios in the house ?
- No, No.
Good day then.
JEWS NOT WELCOME
FORBIDDEN TO JEWS
I don't want anything too expensive,
you understand ?
Or just this one ....
Seven Jewels , in a Swiss factory,
But, all the craftsmen are German immigrants.
It's 42 Guilders.
Its for Aniversary.
We could spend little more.
Oh, Well,,,Then just this one
Bamendor works.
uhh...Excuse me...
Papa, Are you going out ?
I will not caught around this house
and do nothing.
Papa ?
Excuse me..
I'm Sorry.
Yes...
You... see...
You could have it engraved...
Or you could order it in ...
White Gold.
The White Gold is 60.
- Here's your star.
- Next.
You shouldn't be here.
I have come for my Star.
They are for Jews.
You don't have a "J"
on your identity card.
You could get it for me.
If we all where them
they would't know the difference between...
a Gentile and a Jew.
Go home, please.
Go home.
I will wear my Star !
And I wont take it off....
Until GOD tells me to take it off !
The GOD of Abraham and Issac...
Are my GOD, too !
Who's the leader ?
Hurry, Quick.
Turn around !
Good Morning...
Isn't it Miss.Ten Boom ?
Children, Stop here.
The watch maker shop ?
Ten Boom, Berteljorisstraat !
Yea, you came for our radio.
I wrote to my Father.
- I told him about your shop.
- Who are those boys ?
Why are they being allowed to
torment that man ?
They are young Dutch patriots.
You might have heard public statements
derogatory to the Reich and our Fuhrer.
They are expressing their indignation.
Patriots ?
Who are these children ?
I teach a class.
I tell them about GOD.
And this I used to.
This will be the last one.
Thanks to your new directive
concerning unauthorised meetings.
Miss. Ten Boom...
The measures are temporary.
When all this is over.
When order has been restored,
then all the Aryan peoples will live together
as brothers in our life.
Men live together as brothers
only in the Kingdom of our LORD.
Nowhere else.
May we go ?
Come... yea.
Children... Children...
Come ! Come !
Have some cookies. yea...
Jan comes running for
the cookies.
Lisa, yea.
Carol... ah, yea !
Ha ! Cookies ?
I may not be able to be with you
for a while.
But Jesus will still be there...
Always watching over you.
You see without Jesus,
We are like this.
Empty !
We can do nothing.
But then Jesus fills us...
with His Love,
Then we are full....
Yea !
We can do anything.
We can do anything...
Nothing serious, Pastor.
Little bit dirt may be.
It has been loosing
May be a good cleaning.
You can do it in an hour ?
While I am here...
It really would be most helpful.
Yea !
Good !
I will have an hour chat
with your papa.
I hear he has been wearing
a Jewish Star.
Stubbornness is the child of pride..
And pride is the first of the seven deadly sins.
I will speak to him about it.
I will need to be back
at the Church by 1:30.
It will be ready.
Dr. Heemstra !!
Miss. Ten Boom.
Can only stay for a moment.
We need milk for him,
not soup.
Good LORD.... You don't intend
to keep it !
But you can't !..........
It's illegal !
You could all be arrested !
Aha.. he is beautiful.
Pastor...
The LORD must have sent you here !
You live in the Country !
There he could be safer !
Its...
Impossible.
I have my own family to think of.
We could loose everthing
for that child.
Where would my Church be
without a Shepherd ?
- Ah, But...
- No, Betsie !
Pastor has decided.
It is the Law !
And Christians must obey the Law !
Think what you are risking,
for the sake of one Jewish baby.
Will you report us, Pastor,
If the baby must stay
a while with us ?
Corrie...
We are ment to obey the law of the State
If it does not go against
a higher law of GOD.
Pastor, you want me to
take off my Star.
Very well... I will not wear it.
And we will keep the child.
As a Christian...
I am sorry that any man
must suffer,
No matter who he is
what his race.
- But remember it is the Jews,..
- Who gave us the Bible...
and our Saviour !
It is on your heads.
I'll pick up my watch tomorrow.
Good Day, Ten Boom.
Ladies.
GOD forgive him.
He did not mean it.
How can that man call himself
a Christian ?
If a mouse lives in the cookie jar,
that doesn't necessarily make
him a cookie.
What do we do ?
- He must have milk !
- He should go to the country.
- Careful, He'll suffogate.
- No
- Where would you send him ?
- GOD will know.
Doors are opening
all over Holland.
Last week we had a Dutch farm girl
and a peasant Baroness in the same bed.
And now you will have our little
Moses into basket.
Corrie, Please.
Thank you.
- Willem !
- He must not cry !
- You certainly are organised.
- It's not the first time.
We are away station...
For a day or a week.
You hid this from us, Willem ?
Germans Jews before the occupation,
and now the Dutch.
We do what we can.
But the Nazis will not be satisfied
until there is not a Jew left in Europe.
They have touched the Apple of GOD's eye.
I pity them.
- I hate them.
- Ah, Corrie...
You can't hate anyone and
walk with the LORD....
You could have told us,
Willem, We might have helped.
It is important toget our
little friend out of here.
You would be hard pressed to explain
this sudden gift from heaven.
Son, I will walk with you
a little way.
Good Bye, Moses.
We have been managing all right.
Sometimes we have some potatoes...
and occasionally eggs even !
So far we have not done too badly.
And of course we...
- Is this the Dutch farm girl ?
- Grand pa !
Kik, Did you get anything ?
The carbon from the waste basket,
If you hold it out to the light,
You can just make it out.
Thank you.
You see, Papa...
- We have a contact in the Gestapo...
- H a a s h   !
He gives us a deportation list
whenever he can.
Alright, Kik ?
Bye, Grandpa.
- God Bless you, Kik.
- Steady it with one hand... Good !
Papa...
Everyday now...
They send 400 Jews from Amsterdam
Central Station.
We reach those we can.
Do we know anyone on the list ?
- I beg your pardon.
- No, please...I...I...
I am sorry ...
to inconvenience you.
May be he is a...
Papa...
There is a Gentleman upstairs.
We have met.
- It was too late...
- He has no place to go.
Papa, He is a Professor.
Willem studied with him.
They closed the university.
All the Jewish teachers
were forced...
Ah, Betsie...
Good morning again, Professor.
I appologise for the intrusion,
Mr. Ten Boom.
Please...
Thank You.
Professor...
Will you do us the honour
of asking the Blessing ?
Amen.
Amen.
How fortunate aunt Bep
had big feet.
Yes.
Hmm... When were you born ?
Born ?
Father's Name ?
Ten Boom Casper.
Mother ?
Ten Boom Cornelia.
Her maiden name ?
Miss. Ten Boom...
If we are stopped, ey...
I could never
pass as you.
Professor Ziener...
There are no ifs in GOD's world.
He brought you to
this house,
And he will see you
get safely away.
This is your turn, Professor.
Stay close with me.
I'll try.
It's wonderful, Professor !
We are almost there.
- Katrien !
- Aunt Corrie !
- Aunt Corrie !
- Katrien !
I need your father's help.
You should have seen Professor Ziener
getting into the boat.
Katrien's father was attending him like
Queen Willemina boarding the yatch !
Cornelia, do you think that you are
enjoying this a little too much ?
Enjoying ?
No, I was terrified.
I am been able to laugh at it
all dressed up like Betsie...
Oh....Thank GOD.
He kept the patrols away.
Be sure to save a piece of cake
for Willem's friend.
Friend ?
It is all very mysterious.
Someone he wants us to meet.
What did Willem say when you
told him about Professor Ziener ?
This is not some game you play
when the mood strikes.
If you become involved in
this work,
people will be forced to trust you
with their lives...
I told you, Willem.
We gave him my papers.
We thought it out
very carefully.
And if they questioned him...
Was he supposed to sing Soprano ?
No !
He was going to have ...
Quincy Throat.
Excuse me.....
When you wander along the cannal
taking someone out of there ?
How did you know
that you could trust him ?
I knew the man....
And he knew what the LORD told me.
Papa...
You are the master of this house.
The Master of this house...
Commands that we open the door
to anyone who knocks.
We cannot afford to
ignore anyone
who seriously engages in our work
whatever the methods.
Perhaps you will allow us
to assist your efforts.
Thank you for the delivery, Mr. Smit.
Only for emergencies !
We have a contact at the exchange,
But you can never be certain that
the line is not tapped.
But you would expected to develop
your own sources.
The less contact you
have with me,
or with anyone else...
the better.
Willem,
We know half of Haarlem.
We have friends everywhere !
Dear Lady,
Knowing them is onething...
- Knowing their political views...
- GOD knows !
And we will ask Him to lead.
We appreciate your concerns,
Mr. Sluring.
We are not the most likely candidates.
But since there is a need,
we must do what we can to meet it.
People have everykind of reason for
wanting to work in the underground,
Excitement ! perhaps....
Mr. Sluring,
We've passed the age when excitement is of
any major concern in our lives
Truthfully...
I would rather do anything else.
I would like to close the door
and never open it again.
Until this whole hideous
thing is over.
But that's me.
My LORD JESUS...
Tells me to open the doors
to whatever comes.
To give His Love
in what ever way I can.
And I will listen to His voice...
Not mine.
Do we pass inspection ?
How many can you take ?
There is... Mama's room,
and there's your old room,
And there is.... aunt Anna's room,
and... aunty Bep's room
and our 3 rooms... there is 7.
And could share bed
if we have to.
So our hotel is ready
for guests.
Not quite.
What you do
if Gestapo comes ?
You'll have a visitor
Jan Smit.
Actually it's 2 houses
Over a 100 years ago
they were joined together.
The one in the front is 2
rooms deep and 1 room wide.
The one at the back...here
Is 3 rooms.
One on top of the other.
Papa, This is Mr. Smit.
Mr. Smit.
We know some Smits in Amsterdam.
Are you the Smit family that...
Papa, this is the man I told you about.
He has come to inspect
the house.
Oh... a building inspector ?
Do you have offices
on Grote Hous street ?
No, Papa, he is not a building inspector
and his name is not Smit.
- Not Smit ?
- Excuse us, Papa.
We must locate the rest of the house.
The Parlour...
Meal times..... that's the
favourite hour for a raid...
Watch your waste baskets...
and astrays.
It need to be as high
as possible.
They'll ask for the best chance to reach
a safe place while they search below.
- These are all bedrooms ?
- Yea.
If the raid comes at night,
They'll have to take their bedding
Make certain that the
mattress gets tugged.
The favourite trick of the Gestapo
feeling for a warm spot on the bed.
What's up there ?
The roof is directly above.
Who sleeps here ?
I do.
Perfect !
The Wall ... will go.
Here !
All clear...
The sign is in the window.
You see there is a
distinctive marking,
You can always sell
Flenstadht's work.
Lovely day, Aunt Betsie.
Peter, no !
- I'll come for it tuesday then.
- Good.
Uhha. Ten Boom !
Frisian !
Such beautiful wood !
My Father made a case like this once.
Oh, He spent months building it,
polishing, oiling.
It is just a shell...
It needs complete
set of works.
What price will you be asking ?
Well, It will take some months to be ready.
Name a good price.
Exorbitant even, I will Pay.
I like the Clock.
- I can afford the best !
- But...
It has no works..
No....hh.
Very well.
Tuesday, Mr. Ten Boom.
Kik ! Hurry !
Aunt Betsie, How many times
do you have to be told ?
Take the sign out of the window
when it isn't safe ! !
Kik...
I'm sorry ... I'm sorry !
Grandpa... Look !
Tea, Mr. Smit ?
Ah, Thank you !
Yes, yes, yes,... yes !
- Good Morning.
- Milk !
Not Milk ! Paint !
Paint ?
Betsie ! O Betsie !
Do you remember
Fred Koonstra ?
Of course, he read our
electric meter for years.
- His daughter was in our Bible class.
- Yea.
- Milk !
- Paint.
Paint !
Elsie Koonstra.
I know her name i just have to
sort out few faces.
She must be into her
twenties by now.
I heared yesterday that Fred Koonstra
works in the Food Office.
Where ?
They issue ration cards.
I will be frank
we had some unexpected company.
First, a baby...
Then a man,
and then last night, a couple.
All Jews, Mr. Koonstra.
Why do you tell me ?
There are only 3 of us
left at home now.
My Father, My Sister and Me.
And our ration cards are
just not enough.
All ration cards are checked.
Accounted for in dozen
differnt ways.
Yea ! Yea ! I know I...
Should not have asked you.
I thought perhaps you
could advice me.
The food office at Utrecht
was robbed last week.
- Men were caught.
- And shot.
If it happened at noon and just
the record clerk and I were there.
We would have to be tied and gagged.
How many cards
do you need ?
A hundred !
I know someone who
might do it.
Papa, Now !
Papa !
- Done.
- How long ?
They better not send us
anyone wider than me.
Hallelujah !
Oh LORD ! we ask Your blessing
on this Hiding Place.
You can eat what you like !
- Herren, It is not kosher.
- Its not a problem.
Could you pass the potatoes,
Please ?
Oh..My GOD !
Go, go, go! go!
Hurry, Hurry.
I will get one to put,
one on each side .
Your'e spilling it !
Corrie ?
One minute and 15 seconds.
It's long enough to cuddle
the stomach.
Peace be with this house
and all who dwellth in it.
- The peace of the LORD GOD...
- Please come in, Don't stand outside and pray.
I was told that you have accomodations.
I will require a room for myself,
quiet for study and preferably
with no children.
Well, Can you take me in ?
Well, yes, but there are
many questions that i have...
I would like something to eat.
Last meal was yesterday.
Thank you ! Good afternoon.
This is a Kosher House ?
Well, we try, we have many requests
that we are not able to handle..
And there are no children ?
Well, not at present,but
they come and they go.
Let them stay gone
while I am here.
This is the way ?
- Yea ! I regret...
- My contacts have told me...
that most of you guests are transients that
they are on the way out of the country.
- Most of them, Yes.
- Well, I will not be.
I am a teacher and chief compere
for the congregation Beth Kodesh
I will not be driven away by grining sea
creatures their powers and their Reich
Who is this man ?
A Patriach like Issac or Jacob
Father of Nations !!
Papa, We have a new guest.
This is my father, Mr. Ten Boom.
Papa, This is Mr...
Wijnstok, Meyer Wijnstok.
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Ten Boom.
GOD willing and the accomodation
proving suitable,
I will be staying with you
until this nonsense is over.
- You're Welcome.
- Thank You.
Miss. Ten Boom,
My room, please.
Aunt Betsie !
My friend Jan wants a
place to stay for a while...
He got away from the transport.
By noon tomorrow he will have
new identity papers.
But...
Where did you get the uniforms ?
Not all Germans are Nazis,
Aunt Betsie.
Is it Jan ?
Corrie ! Mr. Wijnstock refuse
kitchen duty again.
He has to study..
If he wants to eat he must
have to share the work.
- Where is he now ?
- In the parlour.
Oh can I have a ...
Oh, excuse me! I'm sorry.
Corrie, He's already been upset today.
He found out we call him
"Eusie" behind his back.
We save his great dignity.
He should be flatter,
he reminds us of a scholar
But a Gentile scholar...he said...
We should have atleast
called him "Josephus".
Rules are rules !
M. Wijnstok, my sister tells me
that you have refused,,,
Miss. Ten Boom, I am Praying.
First you refused to work on saturday
because that was the Sabbath.
Then you refused to work on sunday
because that was our day of rest.
I was simply trying to pay respect
to the practise of this house.
But today is tuesday.
Tell me, Miss. Ten Boom,
Why you've found it necessary
to give me a nick name ?
We called you "Eusie" simply because...
Eusie is a kind of name
you give to a pet cat.
As a guest in your house am I no
longer entitled to respect...
We are getting completely
out of subject.
However as if it seems to give
you both satisfaction.
Please have the courage to
use the name to my face.
You want Eusie,
Eusie it will be.
Ladies !
- Good Morning !
- Good Morning !
- Good Morning !
- Good Morning !
After Seven !
Just smell breakfast ?
Yea...
Betsie !
Betsie...
- Good Morning !
- What is it ?
- Today is the 18th !
- It's Mama and Papa's Aniversary !
- Oh, no!
Tell Mr. Klassen,
It's for Papa.
Corrie...
Corrie...
That blouse and that skirt...
You just can't. Not today.
But its a....
You look like a flag
on a mud boat
You always liked this blouse.
The blouse is beautiful,
and you are beautiful.
But the combination of you and
blouse and skirt....
is impossible.
Papa Ten Boom, You are
a most singular man.
You are such a great man !
There must have been a great woman.
Now, this is not
exactly a song...
it is more a...
a Blessing.
Its a ..It means
May GOD bless you,
May He protect you,
May His face
shine upon you !!!
You want the whole of
Haarlem to hear you ?
I did not asked to be born a Jew.
I am sick of being expected to...
bear the burdern of suffering
for the entire world.
Because my Mother's
name was .. Stein.
So you will be another Esau,
Selling your birth rights
for a mash of porridge
I don't want your great
Judaic Heritage !
I dont want any part of
your LORD GOD JEHOVA.
It is no easy thing,
to stand in the Palm of GOD's Hand.
Betsie, go to the door.
- Betsie, go !
- Yes, yes I'll go.
Yes, in a moment !
This is Beukers.
Betsie, are you crazy ?
The whole street can
hear your Jews singing.
Oh! Thank you !.
How can I ever remember them ?
You used to pass
messages in Church.
- Kik !
- Aunt Corrie.
All these numbers...
What do they mean ?
Different things,
instructions mostly.
Instructions of what ?
Well, there could be
a Pilot down somewhere.
The numbers could be coordinates
for picking him up...
Or may be for blowing up
a Nazi supply train
Things like that.
Sabotage ?
We could have blood on our hands.
For Holland.
Does that make it right ?
Lieing, stealing, killing ?
What ever helps Holland is right.
Need the message, Aunt Corrie,
they are waiting.
Will there be life,
when this is over ?
Miss. Ten Boom?
Yea !
Thank you for being so prompt.
I'vee heared a great deal about you.
about your work.
- I am afraid it is my father's work.
- Not of watch making.
Your other work.
You mean the children ?
We had to disband the class.
Miss. Ten Boom,
Many of us who are in opposition to
publicise our feelings,
are in great sympathy in
what you are doing.
People call your house
"GOD's Underground".
Are you trying to trap me Sir ?
Using the name of the
LORD is not the way.
If it were a trap you would be down
the hall talking with the Gestapo.
This will go no further.
Then why did you send for me ?
I want you...
to pass this man's name on to your freinds.
Who is he ?
A business man.
He betrays people to the Gestapo.
The going rate is 75 guilders a head.
Just pass it on...
They'll take care of him.
If I could do what you ask......
It would be same as killing him myself
I can only put him in
the hands of the LORD,
And ask the LORD
to reach his heart.
Do that, Miss. Ten Boom.
The demons are out tonight ?
I would assume you could sleep to anything
Some Tea ?
Thank you.
You Know, Miss. Ten Boom...
You and I are very much alike.
Stubborn...
Tough...
Determind.
You still don't do
your share of the work
Yea..Same, Yes.
But I... I am also...
So ......Are you in !
Did you know that...
I have a wife and small son ?
Precisely, I do not choose to expose myself.
They got away.
Atleast I.....
think they did.
I will not go around
like the others,
begging for sympathy and reassurance.
We know so little about each other.
you are busy yourself with our needs.
Surely you have some needs of your own.
It's people like us,
Miss. Ten Boom...
Ragging torrents behind the stubborn jaw.
No torrents.
Might say my life
has been ......boring;
Till all this ?
Until all this.
Was marriage never considered
for the daughter's of Ten Boom ?
Betsie was always unwell.
She was told she could not bear children,
so she choose not to marry.
And you ?
I had a young man,
but i was not cut from fine
enough cloth for his family .
I lacked grace.
Still,
I was the first woman to be
licensed watch maker in Holland.
And you have your Father,
and you have your Religion.
Is it enough ?
More than enough.
GOD has been good to me.
Yes, eu...
I think he has.
And I think...
I shall be going back to my bed.
I will pray for you family.
Don't think that you'll get me to
peel potatoes, Miss. Ten Boom.
Good Morning.
Miss. Ten Boom ?
Yea ?
My name is Vogel...
Jan Vogel.
I came all the way, from Ermelo.
You have a watch that needs a repair ?
I need 600 Guilders.
I've heared that you have certain contacts.
I don't understand.
It's my wife...
She is been arrested.
She is Jewish.
That's a lot of money.
There is a police man who will
arrange everything for 600 Guilders...
And she'll need a place to hide.
What now ?
Someone is calling for this
within the hour.
Mr. Jan Vogel.
He is from Ermelo.
His wife has been taken.
It's for a bribe.
Oh...You are impossible.
Now hear...
I will take care of it.
Now will you please go to bed ?
But Willem and Tine are coming.
- You can come down later.
- Be sure to call.
I will.
- And use the steam kettle !
- Yea, Yea.
I felt it today the LORD would
have us read from Romans - Chapter 8.
What then can seperate
us from Christ Love ?
Can hardship or calamity,
can persecution or abuse,
if we are hungry, or poor,
or in danger ?
or threatened with death, does
that mean that GOD has deserted us...No ?
Despite all this,
We have overwhelming victory
through Christ who loves us.
For I am convinced that neither
death nor life,
nor the powers of heaven nor
the powers of hell itself
can keep GOD's Love from us.
Nothing in the world as it is...
Or the worlds, that it shall be,
in the forces of the Universe...
in all creation will ever be
able to seperate us...
Along the side door.
Come on.
All Upstairs !
Corrie !
Yea, I am sorry we are
closed until 2 O' Clock.
Miss. Ten Boom...I..
I have an appointment with you sister.
Mr. Vogel ?
I need the money, now !
- Yes, Of course I'll get it.
- Please ! Miss. Ten Boom !
- To your places, everyone !
- Come on, Hurry up !
- Please, Miss. Ten Boom.
- Yes..,Yes in a moment !
I am just collecting it.
Upstairs, I'll take the top !
Miss. Ten Boom ?
Ten Boom, Elizabeth.
Where do you hide your ration cards ?
I don't know what you
are talking about ?
- Where are the Jews ?
- What Jews ?
Lord Jesus, help me !
- Where are the Jews ?
- Saviour save me.
Where is the secret room ?
Corrie !
This must stop !
There's been no wrong
done in this house.
Then what are you doing
with all these ration cards ?
Feeding an Army ?
What does it say in the book of
your's about obeying the Government ?
There comes a time...
When we must choose between God and man.
Keep moving.
- Name ?
- Cornelia.
Ten Boom, Elizabeth.
- Name ?
- Ten Boom, Casper.
Papa !
Only Six ?
Seven.
God is with us.
Ten Boom...
Give me your word you'll
behave yourself,
And you can die in your bed
old man.... where you belong.
If I stay behind,
I will open my door to anyone...
who knocks for help.....
Close it up.
Seal the House.
Out ! Out ! Out !
Corrie, take my hand.
- My sister she needs a doctor.
- Move on !
Papa !
Papa !
GOD be with you, Papa !!!
And with you all, my daughters !
I have to get in there.
Fever down ?
You have them worried.
Tifus.
Yesterday's ration,
I saved it for you.
Listen, I have family here.
My sister, my brother,
My father, my nephew,
the Ten Boom family.
Can you find out where they are ?
Maybe, listen...
I can get soap,
aspirin, cigarettes.
You can pay me when you start getting mail.
Soap, 25 Guilders, Aspirin, 50.
Cigarettes, 100.
Almost anything.
Can you get me a Bible ?
It's Kik ! It's safe now.
Oh, thank GOD !
Shh....Over the roof, quickly.
The roof !
- Where are you family ?
- Hurry !
- The Ten Boom s ?
- Still in prision.
That's all we know.
Mama made it cover it on my bed....
It was in a truso.
The painting by the mirro is a...
Do not go !
Stay...
Please.
They think i have to feed you.
- Everybody is been released.
- Everybo ?
Except your sister Betsie
And your father too, I think.....
- I am not sure.
- O ! Thank you, LORD !
O LORD, Thank you !
Here's a bread from the
warden's bakery ......Fresh !
O LORD...
You have done wonders.
Don't I get little credit ?
LORD, Bless this Angel.
Bless you !
Do u think you can last
here doin that.... Praying ?
The only way to live here is to hate.
Hate can put you in a
worst prision than this.
I have been 3 years in this hole.
I worked my way to a position.
I live to get the
swine who betrayed me.
And that's 75 Guilders !
Are you cold ?
It seems reasonably pleasant.
I'm Sorry.
Now you are here for the
violation of rationing rules.
Would you mind telling me ,
where you got these extra ration cards ?
Sometimes they just appeared.
What do you mean... appear ?
Pushed under the door.
Sometimes they were handed
to me in the market.
By whom ?
- By Mr. Smit.
- Mr. Jan Smit?
Would you tell me all your other activities ?
My sister and I held Bible classes,
until such meetings were forbidden.
And we worked with retarded children.
- How ?
- Excuse me ?
How would you work with them ?
We taught them about GOD.
What a waste !
If you wanted converts,
surely one normal person is
worth all the halfers in the world.
In the eyes of GOD one simple child
may be worth more than.....
A watch maker's daughter ?????.
Perpahs...
But I know he keeps me
always in His sight.
You actually believe that ?
I beleive that you are
in His sight too.. Lieutenant.
Tell me, Miss. Ten Boom,
How can you believe in a God
Who lets an old man die in prison ?
his body forgotten somewhere
in a pauper's grave ?
My Father ?
I understand he was taken ill
after about 10 days.
He was taken to hospital in the Hague,
Unfortunately...
there were no beds available.
He seemingly died in the hallway.
Some failure of organisation.
Under such circumstances when
no one claims the body ...
It is difficult to trace.
I know where my Father is.... , Lieutenant.
That will be all,
Miss. Ten Boom.
You have news from home.
ALL WATCHES SAFE

Yes, yes, You can.

Danka !

How much for underwear ?
Week's bread ration.
O LORD, You have given us your Word,
and hidden it to everything.
Now open up a way for us to
get it through the gates of hell.
It's in GOD's hands now.

Imagine what mama would say ?
Ravensbruck...
Is not a rest camp.
Roll call 4:30, every morning.
Tomorrow assignment, the work details.
Those who cannot work report to sick call...
Don't say i better be sick !
You will receive one half pound
of bread...
One half liter of soup per day.
Once on observation upon
which your life depends....
There is only one road to freedom.
Work !
Get it up !
Hold them in !
You're Dutch ?
Some of my people are Dutch.
On my Mother's side.
You are not the only one suprised to be here.
I thought I would be working
at reallocation center...
Refugees.
Supplies are extreamly limited.
And accurate record is essential.
I know my way around hospitals,
I was kind of nurse once.
I assume that is why you are assigned here.
I'm a midwife.
I brought Jewsish babies into the world.
You are not to touch the things in here.
Soap, Vitamins, Painkillers...
Yeast, Quinine.
I always have the key to this cupboard.
However...
You will find it that
I often forget to lockup.
I hope you understand...
...66685.
Thank you, LORD !
He don't expect
thanks for this.
It's warm !
I am thankful for every moment
we can be together.
We can atleast lie down tonight.
There has to be a plan, Corrie.
I won't be greatful for the lice.
GOD doesn't make mistakes.
How is it its the hospital ?
Is it though your temperature
has to be above 104 to be admitted ?
That's the rule.
There is a gaurd in the laundry
you can get underwear for a price.
- What does she want ?
- Bread rations.
- Oh, Dont cut too much !
- What you want, hair or lice ?
You'll learn to love
the little darlings.
The gaurds won't step foot in this lice pit.
Pass the door.... we can do anything.
Even Lice !
Here !
Somebody over slept.
The loony.
Ah, Corrie...
We are in Hell !!
Why do they keep us so long ?
To break us.
Betsie, Look !
I was certain no one would die,
We would all go home.
Those days on the train,
The LORD seemed to promise.
How could I have misunderstood ?
Dear Father, help me.
Don't let me listen to my voice
and think it's yours !
O, JESUS...
Show me how to live in this place....
You too love Him ?
Put these in the mattress.
Not now ! It's Yeast,
And don't go spooning it around.
I can never get enough for everybody.
This method consisted of painting
on the small dots
of pure colours on the canvas.
And colour blending was achieved...
by placing dot of different
colours next to each other.
And then, from a distance,
the two colours
appear blended into
one single new colour.
JESUS CHRIST has made it possible...
For us we ...need to have direct access.
- There is a repeat in that point.
- In the second movement ?
There is a ritardando
at the end of third part.
Ta.. da... da....
- You are quite wrong,
- retardando is later.
Attention ! Attention !
NO ROOM !
NO ROOM !
You find room.
German whores...
We ran them through the hospital...
infected.
Pass the yellow badge ?
Race Defiler ...
go to be with the slavic labourer.
She is just a child.
You trod on my foot !
Don't exert yourself, Countess.
It's all I can carry.
Any more and i'll have to stop altogether..
I decide who stops !
Betsie !
I decide who stops !
No !
Don't hate, Corrie...
don't hate.
- I'll first of all warm this.
- You owe two day's bread !!
I will pay you next week.
No !
Don't !
JESUS knows everything we feel.
He promised that when 2 or 3
get together in his name
He would be there with them...
Even in Ravensbruck !
In our lives, before,
we would have been
seperated by so much.
But here, all that has been stripped away
And we see the Truth :
JESUS in each one of us.
Light in this darkness.
And we can praise Him together.
Two days bread I need.
I'll give you one.
Two... Who else you know
has the Scarf !
- I will give you one now, one tomorrow.
- I will break you.
Come on, rub it !
Rub it in !
A whole transport of poles came in last night.
- Vulture.
- You should know.
- I have an underwear.
- Eyes front !
- It's wool .
- No !
- Two days bread ration.
- My comb.
I'll collect later.
Nothing for the comb.
Rub hardly!
- Rub it.
- Thank You.
O ! the sky is so peaceful.!
You politicals don't have anything
to do with trash
We're all trash.
I took it from the tray...
In the infirmary.
Continue, continue !
I thought you are smart.
You called attention to
yourself in a line.
Imbecile ! Could you not wait until
you're back in the block
You are such a greedy fool ?
You German Cow !!!
You know i should let them kill.
You great...
lumbering, imprestável!
You would like to go to the ,
No light, no water.
You will never do anything
like stupid again !
Never !
Now I...
I'll dress your hand.
"Comfort the frightened,
help the weak,
be patient with everyone.
do not repay
evil for evil,
but always try to do
good to one another.
Always rejoice.
Pray constantly,
give thanks in all circumstances,
For this is the will of GOD in JESUS CHRIST ."
And to the mindless the
word sound so comforting.
In this place it's mockery !
GOD didn't make this place......, Man did !
But He has power. Surely He could stop them.
Unless ofcourse, He is the sadist.
No ! He is Love, all Love.
Then He is impotent.
You can't have it both ways my dear !
You see what is around you.
We see another world,
Just as real :
Our life with GOD.
Everyday...
it gets deeper and stronger.
You'll think that you can't exist
side by side but, we know it do !
We live them both !
It's enough knowing that we
are so much done,
moving from nothing to nothing.
But you must believe your GOD..
smells that stench from those chimneys
and refuses to do anything.
If only...
you could know His Love...
I am Maria Wrochek...
First violinist of the
Warsaw Symphony Orchestra.
Did your GOD will this ?
We cannot answer.
All I can say is, that the
same GOD you are accusing
came and lived in the
midst of our World.
He was Beaten...
And He was mocked...
and He died on a Cross.
And He did it for Love...
for us.
And why do you think...
your GOD of Love sent you here ?
To obey Him.
If you know Him,
you don't have to know why.
First you take juice of 4 oranges,
and half a  cream,
to the cup of sugar.
I only use 3 quaters of the cup.
You should use a full cup.
Then you put peels aside for
grating and you whip the cream.
What kind of cook are you ?
You forgot the eggs.
Do your own recipe, then.
We need more sand.
Corrie...
Corrie...
Don't shut me out.......please.
You know you can only give it to JESUS.
Do you think I haven't prayed ?
But I hate them.
I hate every Nazi in this place !
We can't be more than what we are.
Only JESUS can free
us from ourselves,
from whatever happens.
Sister...
You can't protect me.
You mustn't try.
LORD,
I can not let go of it.
take this...
hate...
out of my life...
and put your love in its place.
JESUS,
so many things I do not understand.
Do not let me go mad.....
Poking about, on my own.
You know that I am.
Saviour...
Hide me in the center
of your will.
How long ?
Four months.
What's it to you ?
Child...
You would like to see me cry.. Wouldn't you ?
Then you could mother me.
I only want to help.
What difference would it make ?
Everything dies here.
A drug for ! A lousiy looking whore !
We need vitamins
and all the calcium you can get.
And you are so damn knuckles.
Two years older she'b be standing

Ah....a baby, Katje,

I do not want to know !
All pregencies are transferred

All this German slop
has to be good for something.
German papers, are thick

There's lot of hot air ! The Yankes
are half way to the Rhine.
So...
We have got some hot air
between you and the wind
Katje, Thank you !
It is funny about you two.
Uhh... tells us...
We need a laugh !
You are always talking about love.
A bit neither of you ever had a man.
We have boy friends.
Did you love your babie's father ?
I was hungry.
He was nice to me.
Your leg is so strange.
Lift this one.
- I can't.
- Well, Try !
I goes like wood.
Oh I am so weak !
Thank GOD... He is strong.
Katje, Katje !
Betsie, try...

Before the New Year.
Both of us.
Both of us ?

Together...
You and I...
Always together.
Water.
Could I sleep here ?
Just tonight ?
It's so cold.
This way we can have 2 blankets.
If GOD loved Betsie so much...
Why ?
Suffering does not mean that
GOD has stopped loving us.
Sometimes...
we have to accept things...
we do not understand.
I love Betsie...
And I love you !
This is the sister.
Corrie, you must look...
Otherwise you'll never know.
She is Beautiful.
Betsie !
We must tell people...
that no pit is so deep
that he is not deeper still.
They will believe us...
because we were here.
- Betsie talked about heaven
like she already been there.
- Yea
No one would
wish her back.
Read for Betsie.
Read for all of us.
"Are we not that
our earthly bodies,
those we have now,
it will die,
must be changed, for our heavenly bodies
which will not die...
but will live forever.
Then the scripture will be fulfilled.
Death is swallowed up in Victory !
The following prisoners will come forward
and standby for selection on pickup.
No, She cannot walk !
Bring her !
Died last night !
Corrie...
For what you said,
I want it, I want him.
Then ask.
I don't know what to ask for.
He knows. Just ask !
GOD is with you !
Sleep well, Corrie...
- Papa ?
- Yes, Corrie ?
What is it like to die ?
When you and I
go to Amsterdam,
When did I give you a ticket ?
Just before we get on the train.
So with death.
