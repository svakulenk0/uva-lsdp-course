The rooms were so much colder then
pain more painful
and laughter much louder
MAN: In 1969,
Richard Nixon was inaugurated president.
Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King
had been assassinated the year before
and the Beatles were still together.
Ralph and I were 19.
Two years out of high school
and we owned the world.
At least, the 83-mile stretch
from Barton State College home.
You know what freedom is?
OK, I'll tell you what freedom is.
Standing on the road
with your thumb out.
Got no cares, no problems in your life.
You can go anywhere you want
in the whole world.
- I wanna go home.
- That's one place you can go.
Douche bag! Go to hell.
I hope your tongue falls out.
Thank you. Thanks a lot, you scum!
You slug!
Thanks a lot, you fucking mould.
- I told my mother I'd be there by dinner.
- It's gonna be a late dinner.
All we need is a ride Ralf,
then we'll be home, I promise.
God... Goddammit! Goddammit!
Something funny?
Hey! Give us a ride,
you motherhumper. Give us a ride!
Argh!
Hey.
Hey, Scott. Scottie.
Eat it. Eat this. There you go.
RALPH: We should've stayed collage man.
At least we could've got laid.
No, you could've got laid.
I've already decided if nothing...
happens by the time I'm 20,
I'll cut it off.
- How you gonna pee there, Scott?
- Sitting down.
You think that's funny?
You've slept with 13 girls, Ralph.
You slept with that girl
with the thingies in her hair?
When? Last night?
Oh, shit.
You wanna get laid, man?
I'm gonna help you out.
I'll show you how easy it is.
Alright, the next car
that comes down that road...
is gonna be the woman of your dreams.
Come on. Look human, look human, OK?
What do you want her to look like, man?
I mean, name your requirements.
- Alive and from this planet.
- OK.
Look. Here she comes. Here she comes.
What's she like? Blonde? Brunette?
She got big boppers,
little boppers? Come on!
She's blonde. Blonde.
Strawberry blonde, actually.
Uh, she's 28 years old.
She wants a younger man.
She wants it. She wants it real bad.
Not bad enough to stop for us, though.
- Shit. Did you see her face?
- What are you telling man.
She's beautiful. She wants you.
Why do you think she stopped?
Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Ralph.
I'm ready. I've been practising.
Is something awfully funny?
No. No. I just thought
you were someone else.
Well, I'm not. I'm just me.
Sorry. Would you still like a lift
or am I too much of a disappointment?
No, no, that'd be great. Thanks.
Let the sun shine in
The sun shine in
Let the sun shine
- Got enough room?
- Yeah, thanks.
You're big, aren't you?
- How big are you?
- About six even.
Really? Is that hard or soft?
- Hey, mister.
- Marshall. Call me Marshall.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to offend.
Let the sun shine
Let the sun shine
Can I see it?
- What?
- I'll show you mine.
You can let us out here.
Ok. This is as far as we
wanted to go anyway.
You don't have to be rude.
It's my car, I can do whatever I want.
- Hey!
- Jesus.
No one touches my friend,
you fucking homo.
Sorry! I didn't know you were married!
SCOTT: Well, at least we got
a little farther down the road.
Hey!
What are you doing? Are you crazy?
We're gonna need it.
Alleluia
Sons of men and angels say
Alleluia
Raise your joys and triumphs high
Alleluia
Sing, you heavens, and earth, reply
Alleluia

- WOMAN: Shh.
"And on the third day,
he rose again from the dead."
"And his countenance was like..."
"Go, ye, therefore,
and teach all nations."
"I am with you always,
even to the end of the world."
MAN: Hey, Ralph! What's happening?
Well, if it isn't Jesus Christ
and Mary Magdalene.
Hi, Ralph. How are you?
It's good to see you, wild buck.
Look at you, you look horrible.
How you doing, Dad?
What brings you girls down here?
Little brother.
Hi, Cottie. Alden, are you a mailman?
Yeah.
Here. I got a special delivery
for you right there.
Look at you two.
- Can hardly tell us apart, huh?
-
How you doing, Bethany Willow?
Why can't you just call me Beth?
So, you jerks took a short cut, huh?
I was about to call the National Guard.
You should've.
We could've used the ride.
Uh-huh? Well, look at you. I wouldn't
have picked you up with a dump truck.
The '60s hadn't really hit yet
in our little town in Maryland,
even though they were almost over.
I mean that in the sense that
not much had changed.
Not in my lifetime anyway.
GIRL ON BIKE: Hi, puppy.
WOMAN: Do I live by myself here?
Anyone going to join me for dinner?
Not you.
Here you are, Happy. Go on.
Kids, it's Easter Sunday,
for Christ's sake.
You gonna rake the yard
before you go back?
No. Well, I gotta study.
You're gonna rake the yard, aren't you?
On Easter Sunday? Wrong.
Come on, cut it out. Beth.
Don't do that.
OK.
- Peace.
- Peace.
- Mercy.
- Ow. Ow. Ow.
Stop it. Goddammit! Stop it.
Close your eyes while I pray for you.
Dear Lord...
Amen.
MAN: Go get 'em, Alden.
Scottie?
How's it going? Huh?
All right.
I like your hair.
- Yeah, I like yours too.
- Yeah?
- Superintendents, huh?
- Yeah.
It's hard to imagine
Dad ever being young like us.
Yeah, well. He might have been
young like you.
He was never young like me.
At my age he was already
married and had me.
Well, he was in a hurry to get old.
That's not my trip.
I keep trying to picture myself...
getting out...
and getting married.
Having a real job, but...
I just can't see it.
So, how's your love life, huh?
You getting any?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
Yeah, I've been doing that
a long time now.
No shit?
I didn't get laid till I was almost 20.
Really? That's a drag.
Yeah.
Well, I guess I was on a slow trip, huh?
Hey, come here.
Get down here.
What do you think of my car, huh?
- It's OK.
- Yeah? Yeah? Tell me the truth.
- It's a piece of shit, Alden.
- Yeah?
Well.
It's yours.
I don't want it.
Well, I'm... I'm giving it
to you, Scott.
I don't want your car, Alden.
Look, you can trade it in
on something else, then.
- It's OK. I like hitchhiking.
- Then park the car and hitchhike.
Look. I'm trying to be nice to you.
What, you trying to make up
for being a prick to me all my life?
Scott. You're my only brother.
Alden, you might have
everybody impressed.
You come in here like some big hero,
in your little uniform
and your little boy's haircut.
I don't buy it for a minute. You haven't
said a word to me in three years.
You're only being nice to me
cos you're chickenshit about Vietnam.
Shut up.
Alden!
Scottie!
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.
Just getting to know each other.
I was wondering if I could have that.
Yeah. Sure.
You must be really
proud of your brother.
Yeah. Wanna come with me?
Shoot a few Cong?
No. It's not my war.
I don't care about it.
- Is that so?
- Yeah.
It's bullshit.
Apologise to your brother.
I'm sorry. But it's bullshit.
It doesn't matter, Dad.
Everyone's entitled to his own opinion.
Not that kind of opinion.
We should get going, huh?
I was thinking we could
throw the football around.
The three of us.
You know?
Call Ralph.
Have a little fun.
I don't think we've got time, Dad.
- You go ahead. I'm not coming.
- What are you talking about? Come on.
I have to run before it gets dark.
It might rain.
You exercise too much, Jessie.
You're gonna give us all a complex.
Just try to catch up.
You folks go, you'll miss the bus.
Aren't you gonna say goodbye to me?
MAN: Happy Easter.
- You be careful over there, hotshot.
- I will.
Don't you pick up anything
you can't put down.
Oh.
Ralph. I'll see you.
Hey.
- Send a postcard from the Mekong Delta.
- Yeah, I will.
Here, come here.
Listen, I don't know about the war,
because they don't give you
a lot of time to think about it.
But you're right. I'm a little scared.
So.
Let's go. It's time.
Bye, Alden.
Well, I'll see you, Dad.
- You give 'em hell, butch.
- Yeah.
You look like you could use a hug.
Don't die.
Don't die.
Don't die!
Don't die!
Bye-bye.
We got three weeks
to report to the local board.
We need volunteers
to march in Washington on July 12...
Nothing can harm me at all
My worries seem so very small
With my waterfall
SCOTT: This is our dream.
A beautiful, beautiful girl.
The kind of girl you'd die for.
Or even marry.
Are you listening to me?
- Hey. Are you paying attention?
- Yes.
Who were we talking about?
Do you know who Aldonza is?
You don't even know who she is, do you?
OK.
Don Quixote, he's going off to fight the
windmills with his faithful friend, Sancho.
He meets a beautiful, beautiful,
beautiful girl. That's Aldonza.
They fall in love.
- You haven't even read this, have you?
- Well... I read part of it.
- It's got a lot of... pages.
- Where'd you get that?
- I had it from before. I made it last.
- Oh.
Could I... could I have a puff?
Puff? Puff? You mean a hit.
A hit. A hit.
What are you doing?
- Hey. That's mine.
- MAN: Thanks, man.
I know you. Why'd you do that?
I'm saving your life.
Remember why we're here?
Fun, which I'm not having right now.
No. To not get drafted.
That's why we came to college.
Do you want to go to Vietnam
and get your face shot off?
Not particularly. Why?
Are you trying to make me paranoid?
No! Ralph, what are you gonna do
when you flunk out and get drafted?
- I'm not gonna get drafted.
- Oh, no?
Oh, good. Good.
I heard a story about this guy
who went in for his physical, right?
Put a candy bar up his ass.
And the doctor says "What is that?"
And he says:
- "Oh, that's shit, Doc."
- Did he get out?
Yeah. They don't want
any shit eaters in the army.
OK, Ralph. I don't have to help you.
But let me tell you something.
If you flunk out and die in Vietnam,
that's the end of our friendship. Fuck you.
I got a girl for you out here.
- Yeah, is he driving a white Edsel?
- No, it is a beautiful girl.
She's walking along all by herself.
Real poetic.
She's coming this way.
She's really cute.
She looks like Katharine Ross. Or a cross
between Katharine Ross and my sister.
- That's not bad.
- Come down here. Show her your weenie.
- SCOTT: Hey, beautiful girl.
- Hey, baby. Up here!
- Oh, shit. It is my sister.
- Christ.
RALPH: Oh, fuck.
Hey, Beth.
SCOTT: I don't know what you want
to come to State for. You're too smart.
BETH: It looks so exciting.
It does?
- What's wrong? You don't want me here?
- I didn't say that. Did I say that?
Here come my little brats!
My God, look at you two.
Oh, big dog. How are you, buddy?
How you doing? Did this one tell you?
- No. What?
- Salutatorian. Know what that means?
- No. I don't know what that means.
- That means she studies, you.
What are these clothes?
Is this what I pay for?
No. I got dressed up
because I knew you were coming.
You little doggy. You little rat boy.
You give your mother a big hug
before I spank you.
- Mom, what are you doing here?
- I just came along for the ride.
Here, I brought you something.
Cookies. Mom, I'm 19 years old.
This isn't summer camp.
I just thought I'd bring you something.
Sorry.
No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Thank you.
- Guess I don't have to worry about you.
- No, I don't think so.
Come on, you playboys. You gonna
take us old broads to lunch, or what?
Want some cookies?
I'll take you to the vomitorium.
You can see what you've been paying for.
What's all this?
Your basic antiwar
touch football demonstration.
I just want to ask three questions,
then you can go back to sleep.
One. Why are we in Vietnam?
Two. How many of you sweet-faced
mother's sons are dying to find out?
- Three. What are we going to do?
- Take the building.
CROWD: Yeah!
Shit! Watch it!
SCOTT: Beth, get outta there!
- That's my daughter!
- Stop it!
Shit, man. Let her go!
MAN: Police brutality!
Police brutality!
RALPH: Mom! Mom!
She's my friend.
- BETH: Leave me alone!
- JESSIE: Scottie, no! Stop it! Stop it!
It's all right.
Sweetheart. Oh, my God.
Are you all right? Stupid, stupid cops!
- Stupid cops!
- MAN: Stupid cops!
Man, that was fun.
We fought in the revolution, man.
You know what freedom is? School's out,
you put your brains away for the summer.
You're grooving along in your own car.
Even if it is a piece of shit.
Wind's in your hair.
You see a hitchhiker. You stop.
You pick the motherhumper up.
Hop in.
We're not homosexuals or anything.
- I have been waiting for almost an hour.
- That's nothing, man.
Took me and my buddy two days once
to go 83 miles. Isn't that right?
- Yeah.
- Now we're making up for lost time.
SCOTT: Whoo!
Whoa, baby!
Whoa!
- Did you ever take driver's ed?
- A car is an expression of one's psyche.
I got a fucked-up psyche.
Don't worry about it.
SCOTT: Hop in.
- Where you going?
- Well, I wasn't going anywhere.
Is there anywhere you want to go?
Guess I could go to Baylor
and see my sister.
You got it.
With big news as it's happening
ANNOUNCER: Here's a look at
the headlines for Saturday, June 14.
Resident Nixon, meeting on Midway
with Vietnamese president Thieu,
says our boys in southeast Asia
are coming home...
All right! Yeah!
Thank you! Thank you, Lord!
Thank you, Mr Nixon.
That's bullshit.
If we're coming home,
how come I'm going over?
...resistance to US forces
in that country.
I got a brother over there.
I just got a postcard from him.
See?
He says it's not that bad if you...
if you like the jungle and
don't mind getting shot at.
Knowing him, he's probably taken over
the place, telling everybody what to do.
Including the Vietcong.
You know, I read that your chances
of getting killed in Vietnam
are less than your chances
of dying in a car crash.
Just shut up. Shut the fucking hell up.
- What?
- Please?
I'm sorry.
- She don't like the way you're driving.
- What?
- You're scaring her.
- You're kidding?
- Yeah. You're driving like a maniac!
- Shit. Why didn't you say? You drive.
- HITCHHIKER 2: Oh, Lordy.
- GIRL: Oh, my God.
I'm going where
the water tastes like wine
We can Jump in the water,
stay drunk all the time
ALL: Whoa!
Can you just slow down to, like, a hundred
or something? Ralph, slow down!
Ralph, stop the fucking car now!
- SCOTT: Get out.
- HITCHHIKER 1: Let me out.
- SCOTT: Get out. I'll drive.
- HITCHHIKER 1: Come on.
- RALPH: What'd I do? What'd I do?
- HITCHHIKER 1: You all right?
- Thanks for the ride.
- Good luck over there.
BETH:
There's something wrong in America.
I don't know what it is, but I'm scared.
There's something wrong
when everybody's mad at everybody else.
Something's wrong when we don't
understand what our country's doing.
When we were little kids and too young
to understand, John Kennedy said:
"Ask what you can do for your country."
And whom are we supposed to ask now?
President Nixon?
MAN: Hear, hear.
Does he know? Does he care?
SCOTT: No!
Boo!
A few weeks ago down at Barton State,
there was a fight about the war in Vietnam
and this boy fell against me, bleeding.
And now, like Lady Macbeth,
I can't seem to get the blood off.
- Try using Ajax.
- It's not funny!
My neighbour's over there.
He is my friend. I don't want him to die.
My other friends could go,
or my own brother. And for what?
To win? Is that winning, when hundreds
of American boys die week after week?
If I were a boy, I wouldn't want to die for
something that makes people so angry.
Would you?
We already have bombs enough
to destroy every organism on this planet.
Where will we be five years from now?
Or 20 years from now?
We are supposed to be the future.
This is our country. What can we do?
All right, Betho!
What's that?
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
Take it. It's acid.
- No.
- Come on.
We'll get some high school graduates
and we'll ball 'em.
You only got three months
till you cut off your weenie. Take it.
- No!
- I took it. I took it.
- I can't believe you sometimes.
- Come on. I don't want to trip alone.
Great. Some friend you are.
From every mountainside
Let freedom ring
- Are you growing up or something?
- Maybe.
- You did good.
- Thanks. Thanks for coming.
- Excuse me, miss.
- Hey, Coach. How are you?
I just wanted to say goodbye
before you got run out of town.
Probably woke up
some zombies around here.
- What about this kid?
- Very interesting. Congratulations.
Thank you.
Oh, Beth, it was a lovely speech.
You made me cry, you made me think.
And you. You look like a fortune-teller.
- How you doing, Dad?
- How'd your finals go?
Finals. I knew I forgot something.
- I saw you.
- Not working at the pool this summer?
No, we're going on the road.
That's what hippies do.
You gotta live life while
you still got it.
Did you see me?
Yeah.
I'm trading in Alden's car for a van.
We're just gonna groove.
What's your brother
gonna say about that?
He'll probably freak out
and kill someone
cos he won't try to understand.
Same as you.
Oh, this is the happiest day of my life.
Hi, honey. How are you?
What is it I'm supposed to understand?
- Me, Dad. Fucking me.
- You watch your mouth.
Well, Jessie, I guess I'm
just like you now.
- Our babies have left the nest...
- RALPH:  Ralph Carr,
class of '67.
Five-time varsity letterman,
graduated...
Thank you.
My sister Beth
got all the brains in the family, but...
I'm ugly, so it all works out.
- I didn't mean to flunk out.
- He flunked out?
So... boom!
COACH: Hey, mister. I wanna talk to you.
MRS CARR: What are you doing?
Are you crazy, Ralph?
- Ralph, what are you doing?
- Come on.
Come on people now,
smile on your brother
Everybody get together,
try to love one another
- No! Don't!
- Ralph! No!
BETH: Ralph!
Some may come and some may go
We will surely pass
When the one that left us here
Returns for us at last
Wait. Ralph.
Come on, Ralph. Can you hear me?
- Ralph! Ralph!
- Did he flunk out?
- I don't know.
- Did you flunk out, Ralph?
- Did you flunk out?
- JESSIE: Everybody quiet down.
COACH: Everybody outside, please.
Oh, Ralph. Oh, sweetheart.
- What's going on?
- Is he on something, Scottie?
- LSD.
- CLIFF: You guys are on drugs?
- Is this the first time he's taken it?
- I don't know.
JESSIE: Cliff, stop that.
- Goddammit it, stop it.
- Come on, Cliff.
What... what is it?
- We'd better get him to the hospital.
- No! No!
You're not gonna take my baby away. No!
- Let him go, Mom.
- JESSIE: Let's go.
No. Ralph!
JESSIE:
Cliff, would you bring Ev, please?
- Well, is he gonna be all right?
- I think so.
What's going on?
Oh.
Goddammit, Cliff. You owe me a hug.
Oh!
Come down on your own
And leave your body alone
Somebody must change
You are the reason
I've been waiting all these years
Somebody holds the key
Well, I'm near the end
And I Just ain't got the time
And I'm wasted
and I can't find my way home
This is us.
The leaves in the trees.
Most people are mushrooms
or toadstools or worms or something.
But we're leaves, you know, in the sky.
Above all the roots,
the dirt, the dog-doo.
You get it?
You know? Us, leaves.
Like the Beatles...
Bob Dylan, Rolling Stones, of course.
Yeah. They are cool cats.
Yeah.
Probably Kurt Vonnegut.
Beckett. Camus.
Camus? Yeah. Yeah.
Definitely a cool cat.
- Who is he? I forgot.
- He was a writer.
Yeah. Right, I remember. God, I read
everything that sucker ever wrote.
Yeah? So?
- Who else, man?
- Well...
The Kennedy brothers,
even though they're dead.
Definitely leaves, especially Bobby.
And, uh...
probably Eugene McCarthy.
Uh...
Carlos Castaneda. Eldridge Cleaver.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
And what about the Beaver?
And what about Wally? Or no.
He's kinda like a root, I guess, right?
Probably a carrot.
Eddie Haskell would be...
basically... dogshit. Am I right?
- Yeah. You're feeling better, huh?
- Yeah. I think so.
You want to go... want to go
play around in the sand dunes?
- No, thanks.
- Aw, come on, Ralph. What do you say?
- You sure you're all right?
- I'm groovy. Will you leave me alone?
You sure?
I OD'd one time. I flunked out of college.
That doesn't make me retarded.
I don't need a baby-sitter.
You go play in the sand dunes.
OK. Sorry. OK.
See you later.
I'm looking at myself
reflections of my mind
It's Just the kind of day
to leave myself behind
So gently swaying
through the fairyland of love
If you'll Just come with me
and see the beauty of
Tuesday
Afternoon
Tuesday
Afternoon
Does my nudity make you uncomfortable?
No. No. Me, actually, I'm a little
nervous about getting sunburnt.
Ralph loves to take his clothes off
in public, though.
I do?
- That's right. You weren't there.
- Yeah, I was tripping.
Would you like to trip now?
No, thanks, no. I'm trying to cut down.
SCOTT: We're gonna change the world.
- RALPH: You and me?
- No, all of us.
People'll look back on 1969 and say
that's the year everything changed.
Got rid of all that shit.
Prejudice, fighting, poverty, disease.
They'll say it was a year of miracles.
Scott Denny got laid.
Maybe.
- I got drafted and died in Vietnam.
- What's the matter with you?
- Why are you such a bummer?
- I did drugs, so... I'm brain-damaged.
Better undamage yourself.
This is our summer, man.
It's the last summer of innocence.
It's the summer of the leaves.
Wind'll take us wherever we want.
So, where do you want to go, Ralph?
Maybe we should go home.
You know? My mother worries about me.
You are so weird.
It's not just that.
Maybe we should get jobs.
Jobs? We're leaves, Ralph.
Leaves don't need money.
We have naked people
giving us free food.
Maybe I'm not a leaf, OK?
Maybe I'm a rabbit or something.
Anyway, I thought that I might go home.
You don't have to take me. I'll hitchhike.
I've looked at clouds
from both sides now
From up and down and still somehow
They might be looking for me.
Who?
The draft board.
Ralph, they're not gonna find you here.
Ralph.
I'm not gonna ever let them draft you, OK?
You don't have to worry about that.
RALPH: Hey, guys.
Just kidding.
All right! Home, sweet home,
motherfucker. Hi, Marsha.
- Hi, Ralph.
- SCOTT: Hey, Marsha.
There's a girl I like a lot
And when I look at her
I go, ain't this hot?
And when I look into the night
I see her in the sky
Dreaming in the night
Hi. I'm back.
Dreaming in the sky
Dreaming in the night
RALPH: Scottie!
I know she's a beautiful sight
I dream of her every night
Hey, Beth.
Scott.
Scottie! Hi, sweetheart. How are you?
How you doing? Where's your partner?
- He's out doing American Bandstand.
- Oh, great. Go on. Cream your dad.
I will.
Well, look who it is. My Gypsy son.
- Get tired of the crusades?
- Nah. We missed our moms.
I bet. And as soon as we do your laundry,
you'll be back on the road.
Maybe.
What's going on? What's wrong?
They, uh, seem to have
misplaced your brother.
- What?
- Missing in action.
OK. OK.
If anybody comes, you take the van, you
get the hell out of here, you promise me?
No.
It's not your problem. There's
no reason for you to get in trouble.
Let's go.
- What are we gonna do now?
- Window.
In the white room with black curtains
Near the station
Black roof country
No gold pavements
- Where'd you learn to do that?
- Mission: Impossible.
- Ow! Jesus.
- Fuck.
Here. Would you hold this, please?
You don't want to be an accomplice?
You're already in shit. I'll write you
a note saying you're innocent.
Breaking and entering a federal office.
Real innocent.
- You got any better ideas?
- No.
remember him? Guy with teeth like this?
Remember him?
Albertson, Arnett,
Austin, Caminski.
Oh, shit.
Carr. Ralph Maurice Carr.
Wow. Everything about me.
This is embarrassing.
Look at that.
"Process notification."
What in the hell does that mean?
It means Uncle Sam wants you.
Well.
Too bad.
Dean. Denny.
- Scott Clifton Denny.
- I don't want it. Forget it.
Why? Your number'll come up. You can't
stay in college forever. They'll get you
- and you're gonna wind up like Alden.
- I don't want it. Put it back.
What the hell are you
gonna do with yours anyway?
I'm gonna feed it to the dog,
then I'll feed him yours.
- That's not gonna work, man.
- Yes, it is.
No.
My whole life you've saved my ass,
now I'm gonna save yours.
They're gonna know we took them.
We'll be the only ones missing.
No. We'll be missing.
We won't exist any more. Get it?
No.
All right, then. We're gonna burn this
whole place down. Give me the lighter.
- You can't!
- Give me the lighter!
Give me the lighter!
I ain't gonna let you die.
- Give me my lighter. It's mine.
- Get the fuck away from me.
Don't piss me off.
You just pissed me off. It's mine.
- OFFICER: Not at the pool?
- I was looking for my dog.
- You lose your dog?
- Yeah.
- She lost her dog.
- Want us to help you find him?
- No, it's OK. I can find him.
- Sure?
Yeah. Yeah.
Happy. Come here, boy.
Happy! Come here, boy.
- Somebody's down there. You got keys?
- Yeah.
- Shit!
- Come on. We gotta get outta here.
Scott! You don't have to clean up.
Let's go.
- RALPH: Go!
- You go.
Go, asshole!
- Shit.
- Fuck.
You see anything?
- What's going on here?
- We had someone. They got away.
Goddammit.
- OFFICER 3: Who's in there?
- It's Ralph Carr.
Oh.
Hi, Ralph. It's Junior Roberts.
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.
What are you doing with my son, Junior?
Let him go.
- He was poking around the draft papers.
- What?
What ails you, Ralph?
What is the matter with you? Goddammit.
- I didn't want to go to Vietnam.
- Why? Why?
- JESSIE: Cliff.
- I don't even know what it's about.
- Where is Scott?
- I'm right here.
- JUNIOR: Hey, Scottie.
- I was with him, Junior.
- Hey, he's lying. He wasn't in there.
- I was too.
- My folder's on top of the desk.
- You see any other stuff in there?
He's protecting Ralph.
He was in the van the whole time.
- Arrest them.
- What are you saying?
His brother is risking his life
for our country. We don't even know...
- He's dead.
- Scottie.
What did you say? He is not dead.
- He's missing. That means he's...
- Liar!
You are a goddamn liar!
Don't keep pushing me!
They're good boys, Cliff.
Alden and the rest of them.
My own boy, you know, he'll never
be the same after being over there.
We all just better think about it some.
Mrs Denny. Mrs Carr.
You're no longer welcome in my home.
RALPH: I'm sorry, Mom.
Don't take it personally, OK?
- Come on.
- RALPH: OK?
- Beth, let's go.
- No, I want to stay.
Get in the car right now!
Come on, Happy. Get in the car.
- Sorry, pal.
- Hey.
It was fun, man.
Remember those 14 girls
I told you I balled?
I lied about ten of them.
And two of them were really bad news,
but the other two... wow.
Hey, Happy.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Thought you might be out here.
- Yeah. How's life in the real world?
Oh, fine. My mother's drunk.
Your parents aren't speaking.
- Thank God things are back to normal.
- Yeah.
God.
That was pretty wild today, huh?
Bonnie and Clyde ride again.
Yeah.
Beth.
Beth.
It's OK.
Come on.
What are you gonna do?
I don't know.
Gonna get the hell outta this town.
I could go with you.
- Thanks, kid.
- I'm not a kid.
I think you're really beautiful, Scott.
You're the most beautiful person
I've ever known.
Yeah, well. You haven't really
been outside of Culloch County.
What about me?
I think you're really nice, Beth.
I meant...
do you think I'm beautiful or anything?
Yeah. Yeah.
You know so much.
You're so good, pure and...
Shut up! I'm not talking about my mind.
My mind is just getting out of its cage.
- What am I? Like, rat girl?
- No.
No.
You're a lot prettier than I thought.
You're very pretty, Beth.
You're beautiful, OK?
Well.
You could tell me about all the stuff about
the leaves and everything if you want.
Nah. It's a...
It's just a stupid idea I had.
Actually, it's not that stupid.
It's just it's just that some people
understand and some people don't.
Or you could make love to me.
It's the time of the season
When love runs high
And this time, give it to me easy
And let me try
With pleasured hands
To take you in the sun to promised lands
To show you everyone
It's the time of the season
For loving
NEIL ARMSTRONG:
The LEM foot pads are only, uh,
depressed in the surface about,
uh, one or two inches,
although the surface appears to be, uh,
very, very fine-grained
as you get close to it.
It's almost like a powder down there.
It's very fine.
- OK, I'm gonna step off the LEM now.
- CONTROL: Roger, we copy.
- Takes a pretty good little Jump.
- Hon!
They're on the moon.
...one giant leap for mankind.
What's all this?
This is stuff. It was in the
refrigerator and now it's not.
It's my goddamn mess. I'll clean it up.
I think I might go for a walk.
OK?
I was thinking that I could wake up
in the middle of the night
and I could hear my three little men
snoring away.
You with your cute little whisper
of a snore.
Alden with his deviated septum,
sounding like a horse.
Scottie, all intense and impatient.
And I'd think:
"Who are these people?"
"This is an insane asylum."
But I couldn't sleep
until I heard all three of you.
Now I never sleep.
I walk down the hallway,
listen at your door.
I don't hear anything.
Don't you sleep?
I just hope Alden isn't suffering.
- I'd rather he be dead than suffer.
- Oh. We can't lose hope.
Yes, we can. It's our hope,
we can lose it if we goddamn want.
Are you mad at me?
No.
I don't seem to feel anything.
ARMSTRONG: Magnificent sight out here.
ALDRIN: Magnificent desolation.
God bless you, Neil.
Buzzy, God bless you, kid.
Beth?
Happy is not happy.
Who's out there?
Cliff? That you?
What you doing up so late?
Wanna come in?
You shouldn't drink so much.
You should drink more.
Come on, relax, Cliff.
It's the Age of Aquarius.
- Shh.
- Come on.
I see them!
I see them on the moon!
I see them on the moon!
...signature of the president
of the United States...
Scottie. You scared me.
Your father's not here.
I'm sorry about Dad.
I'm sorry too.
Sorry, sorry, sorry.
It's a sorry time.
I don't have to leave.
I can stick around.
No, you go. You go.
That's what I'd do if I could.
I'd get far away from here, where it's safe.
- You go, you hear?
- OK.
- Get. Go.
- OK.
I don't have to worry about you.
Ralph.
Hey, Ralpho.
- One hundred.
- Ralph, Beth's here.
- BETH: What are you doing?
- MAN: Push-ups. Does 'em all the time.
Yeah, I gotta stay in shape
so I can kill in the name of democracy.
Probably won't take you now you're
a criminal. You'll have to go into politics.
Yeah, my pal, Scott Shakespeare.
He's got a joke for every occasion.
You got a problem,
he'll write a poem about it.
Ralph, what is the matter with you?
I wanna go.
Get it over with. To hell with it.
- How's Mom?
- She's OK. She's gonna come see you.
Yeah? When do you think?
Around Christmas?
I'm really starting to
feel unpopular here.
You folks are gonna have to get going.
Ralph.
I was thinking of going back
on the road if that's OK with you.
- With me?
- Yeah.
Yeah. Great. Groovy.
I'd be pissed off if you didn't go.
Beth's going with me.
- Did you ball my sister?
- Ralph.
Is that it?
- This guy balled my sister. You... fuck.
- All right, all right. Come on.
Ralph.
Get him outta here.
He's no friend of mine.
Ralph.
Ralph.
You don't understand.
I'm sorry.
If you smile at me
I will understand
Cos that is something
everybody everywhere
Does in the same language
Wooden ships on the water
Very free and easy
Easy
You know the way it's supposed to be
Silver people on the shoreline
Let us be
Talking about very free
And easy
Come on.
Are we in a hurry or something?
Yeah.
Where are we going?
To Canada.
Horror grips us as we watch you die
All we can do is echo your anguished cry
Stare as all human feelings die
We are leaving
You don't need us
Go
Take your sister by her hand
Lead her away from this foreign land
Far away where we might laugh again
We are leaving
You don't need us
Come on. Come on, boy.
Hi.
- Where are we?
- Either heaven or Maine.
I'm too tired to know.
SCOTT: Pretty, huh? So that's Canada.
It doesn't look that bad.
I'm not going with you, Scott.
What?
It's not over there. It's inside of us,
or it doesn't exist at all.
I don't want to run away.
OK. OK.
Fine.
You're not gonna get drafted and die
for something that nobody believes in.
No. Fuck you.
If you died I would die too.
My father died when I was 11. I know
what it's like to lose someone you love.
I want you to stay with me and fight.
We have to make people understand
that it's wrong.
You folks crossing over? You could
have just gone. It's a free country.
Come on.
Come on!
I once was lost
But now I am found
Was blind
But now
I see
Alden Palmer Denny is the first boy...
from Culloch County to die in Vietnam.
Let us wish him Godspeed and peace
and pray that he'll be the last. Amen.
ALL: Amen.
I said something to my brother one time,
that this wasn't my war.
I guess I was wrong.
It's everybody's war.
I'm sorry, Alden.
My father over there has got medals
to prove that he fought in a good war.
And I'm proud of my father,
even though he doesn't like me right now.
I don't believe that this is a good war.
That's all Ralph was trying to say.
It's all my brother
ended up saying, too.
Seems as though there's nothing
you can do about it though.
That's what you hear on the news,
you know? It's just the way it is.
You can disagree.
You can say that it's not right.
That's what freedom is.
I'm going down to the courthouse now
to try and get my friend out of jail.
And I guess you're just going to have
to shoot me, Junior. But it's a protest.
A protest against this.
Anybody who would like
to come with me... you can.
Get the hell off the road.
Hey, man.
SCOTT: In November of '69,
including my father,
marched in Washington
along with 700,000 other Americans
to protest the war in Vietnam.
This film is dedicated to all of us.
Dedicated to peace.
The windows of the world
Are covered with rain
Where is the sunshine we once knew?
Everybody knows
When little children play
They need a sunny day
To grow straight and tall
Let the sun shine through
The windows of the world
Are covered with rain
When will those black skies
turn to blue?
Everybody knows
When boys grow into men
They start to wonder when
Their country will call
Let the sun shine through
The windows of the world
Are covered with rain
What is the whole world coming to?
Everybody knows
When men cannot be friends
Their quarrel often ends
Where some have to die
Let the sun shine through
Windows of the world
Are covered with rain
There must be something we can do
Everybody knows
Whenever rain appears
It's really angel tears
How long must they cry?
Let the sun shine through
