Kremer, Kremer!
Here, take it!
We were lying at Madagascar,
got infected with the plague
At there, we pray with Latin
Everything is soaked by the water,
everyday there is one man passed away
Hey! Hi! My Friends...
The priest pray with Latin
When captain yelled, yes,
the sailors quiet down immediately
Because everyone missed
their hometown
The hometown they dream
to see once again.
Attention! Bertram is here
Keep singing
We were lying at Madagascar,
got infected with the plague
Everything is soaked by the water,
everyday there is one man passed away
My Friends...
Please take care, young lady
Take care, take care!
When captain yelled, yes,
the sailors quiet down immediately
Come on!
Come here, you poland priest pig
Can't you be more elegant
when singing Deutsch songs?
Looks like I have to teach you the
tempo sense, start from beginning...
We were lying at Madagascar,
got infected with the plague
Everything is soaked by the water,
everyday there is one man passed away
It's you again, you arrogant man!
The priest with egg-frying pan
I ordered, sing!
Sing quickly!
Go, hurry! Move on!
Stupid, listen to the order!
God write down secrets with symbols
We expose it to the world
The sacrifice of Jesus
is because our sin
He devoted everything by his death
The blood of Jesus...
Do you really believe the God exists?
Where is he?
You see it around here?
Pull him up!
In the Jesus blood, we found...
the best way to escape
from depression
The goddes Maria breeds us
Jesus lets human with equal status
He came to search, what we lost...
Who kept singing,
who's the next to be hanged!
...Jesus
Promised with swear:
no matter when I'll always be with you
Is this your mother?
You're so lucky,
I never seen my mother

It's enough for the trip

You're freed.
Have a nice trip!
Pig priest.
Luxembourg, Sunday, January 15, 1942
Mr. Kremer?
Please step into the car!
Welcome to Luxembourg!
Please allow me to introduce myself
Nazi charging leader, Gebhardt.
You want go back with your family?
Saarbr¨¹cken street, thanks.
Please come to Pual's casttle tomorrow morning
at 10 we're going to discuss the topic
we will both feel interesting
Thank you, I'll pray for you.
- Mr. Kremer...
I hope you can arrive on time tomorrow!
Henry!
Henry...
Oh my god!
How do you find us?
We're knocked out of our own home
it's been occupied by Nazi
Henry!
Roger...
Raymond
Hurry, sit down!
Where is your mother?
No one told you?
Our mother has passed away
These shoes are too small
but how about this?
Credentials!
I'm here for Mr. Gebhardt
Upstair, turn left
Luxembourg Civil Law administration
Charging Leader Gebhardt office
I'm very sorry, he is in the interrogation
hello, Mr. Kremer
Priest!
Priest Kremer
Ok, please come in!
Hellow, Mr. Kremer
So, you don't want to
take off your overcoat?
Good morning.
Have you took enough rest
before coming back?
I'm truely sorry about
your mother passed away
She has been here a lot before
and she speaks a lot for you...
Yes, Please put the call through
to prison camp commander Mr. Dachau
Dear Mother, I'm here,
and getting used here
To this naughty camp life
I can only answer: Yes
and will soon be a pig of the prison camp,
can't look back, can't have sympathy to others
can only dump into it,
living under darkness silently
This is the last letter for you in the
prison camp - what do you mean?
Why men become the pig
of this prison camp?
Long live, Hitler...
Yes, thank you.
This thing is about
the prison 25639.
No, he has arrived but very sad,
there is a big mistake
Mr. Kremer is not freed,
he just got the vacation
yes, 9 days precisely
and only one rule:
if Mr. Kremer tries to escape
all the prisoned priest in Luxembourg
will be executed death without exception
Long live! Hitler!
Very sorry, this is
the order from the boss
besides, I do not totally agree
to their decision
I think you should be thankful that
I give you this vacation.
I think, I should give you this chance
for you to say goodbye
with your monther
please sit
Because your action opposed German
you're arrested at the French boundary
Please smoke! You had been
working for French government
joined the "French Luxembourg Mission"
which is against the third Empire...
and try to destory the German construction
in Luxembourg isn't it?
Mr. Kremer
You're a very good speaker
this is seen from your
anti-racism speech
Of course you have your reason!
Jesus is also Jewish
But the Jewish keep
depressing themselves
If allowable, I'll start from the story
long time ago, for all these we have
to thank for the Jesus Christ
Because of him,
we know what we have to be aware of
To us,
we have to be aware of Jewish
Even if only myself to defend the Jewish,
I will fight for the Jesus's bible
Don't you want one?
Oh, yes
Here, have a chocolate,
this you can't resist!
You skiped!
Absolutely not! You did!
You're too slow...
but now I jumped over!
What? is he on time?
On time for a few minutes
People can speak to the priest of what they want
because they have principals,
you should not under estimate him
He is relied by the Vatican,
there must be some reason. - Yes
He is the Cardinal's famous person,
his family is also very well known
The whole Vatican is a big house, and
Luxembourg is just a brick of a damaged house
if we take off the brick,
the walls will fall
But what if Kremer escape?
- He won't!
He is very clear, what would
this bring to his brothers
but will he cooperate with us? - Province
Political Party Leader, there is rumor saying...
the Pope will be soon deciding
the action to the Jewish problem
We should be prepared. The Pope will still come
to congratulate our Leader's birthday every year
and call him the
"Most respectable Mr. Hitler"
Right now he criticize the allize force
to the German's attack
I have no complain to the Vatican,
the Holy See at least for now...
I hope to get the report
everyday goodbye!
Mr. Charging Leader
You're a powerful person
but if your plan failed, even if you
have good relationships with
the top couldn't help you at all
We need a lot of talented people
for the East Prison camp
Oh, I remembered.
You were there before.
If this is a vacation, are you
going back to the Dachau's camp?
People have to stay
at their position...
stay where he belongs to,
and believe in God.
What's this mean?
I can't...
Nazi treats the priest better
than the others
usually, 4 people have
only one bread
but we can have one
for each 3 priests
they hope, every other
people will hate us
are you going back?
if you can't eat now,
then eat it later
if he tried to escape,
we'll also be punished
what the bullshit you're talking about!
His feet is soo big that no shoes can fit in
where can he escape?
All these things were from Raymond,
should fits you
I changed the waist
of trousers to be smaller
This shoes is from Roger,
Your book is in that basket,
we can hardly bring you anything
Henry Kremer...
Jesus Christ bless you
Long live! Amen
Gerard Mersch. I'm the new manger
of the church adminstrator
It has never been one priest has granded
for vacation from the camp. - Thanks
I'm very sorry,
are you sure you're not wrong?
next week, I have to go back to Dachau's camp
we can let down the hope!
I have to go to see the Gestapo,
I'll be back tomorrow. - Why?
I don't know
Vatican Pope decided to announce
another church policy
we're contacting with Nazi,
this should have advantage
If we do this then the church
will soon have Nazi flag on top
Please forgive me,
I have to prepare for a Mass
What's our cardinal say about these?
He does not step out
of his room anymore
He does not want to have any
direct contact with any politics
As the symbol of against and protest,
the church bell has ringed whole day
Hitler accepted the requests
from the Pope
The request to give the special
priority to the priest inside the camp
This decision has sure reducing
the pressure for you right?
that's right! You should thank
the Pope once again
Before celebration today, I want to know
whom am I serving for?
The Name, The Job?
Jozef Weida
Bishop area, Czestochowa
you?
I'm the Cardinal Kozal
of Bruno Church
Next?
Armando Bausch
Priest coming from Luxembourg, editor
Ah, another form Luxembourg
You have a lot of people coming from there
little country but have a lot of mouth
Name?
Nansen clerical
Professor from Oslo University
Drink off! Drink all!
Drink off! Drink all!
You sure don't like our German's Mossel
grape wine! Get out! Go to the basement!
So? Hurry up!
The saint god father
kept praying for his followers
also pray for the priests
in the camp
the Loving Goddess Maria will take care of him
- How many people he saved by this?
but maybe after the Pope
changed his attitude...
we'll have more people died in the prisoner camp
- Henry, no matter what you have experienced
You should not give up
the faith to God
Some people keep silence
is just for help...
Help the followers won't make
the situation become worse
They give you a vacation
must be some reason!
one important reason is Your family
have a very famous fame in Luxembourg
Henry, maybe they'll do
some special use to you
what do you mean?
The church is facing
the tough challenge!
our attitude will decide,
if there will be more people's death
If we obey German within
our allowable conscience
we'll get more than we resist them
learn smarter, Henry. Listen carefully
to what Gebhardt spoke to you
our world is a lot more complicated
than your small prisoner camp
there, everything is exposed, have your
own rules everything follow the order
This vacation can help you to see
the whole thing by the extensive contacts
for an exmaple you familiar,
we're doing a saint and a meanful battle
I think personally
Amount us, all the great things
are being placed by God.
The sacred of yours, has nothing
to do with the Jesus Christ
but your Pope thinks further.
- If you see the 1933 agreement,
you'll see the signature from the Pope.
the things today.
You attack Poland, then Frence,
Holland, Belgium, Luxembourg
Oh yes? The Pope should knew it at that time
Threats from Bolshevism!
He is very clear, our war is justice
He always sorrow for his own fate
but in the East line of the Battle field,
Jesus Christ decides the future on his own
Please take a look at this artifact!
Please look carefully!
Our soldier saved it.
They discovered that it is being used
by the Russian Moscow.
Area administrator as a stepping-stone.
Bolshevik changed the church of Russia
into Factories and Jail.
They have no concern in destroying
the Christian and their precious artifacts.
People serving god has been
tortured, killed, and expelled.
All these are Catholic sacrifice
under Bolshevism.
These are your brothers!
Look at the small cross on the corpses.
All these happened
just one year ago.
Can you imagine,
can we make such rude crime?
In Dachau's camp, they'll only sentence
the priest into the cremation field
people often see some priest lying
among the corpse and still alive
but they still got executed
Nazi think this is useful, people can
be forgive during the way to the heaven
Mr. Kremer
You and I are mentally brothers.
Your mother realized this and she is surprised
that sacred statue has been damaged like this
She is a true believer,
she believes you
She believes that the coorpration between
Catholic and the Thrid emporer
is specially important.
You can't resist this!
what do you want from me?
From a priest pig coming from the church!
The German cardinal already
kissed the Hitler's feet.
Catholic will be very important after the battle
in Europe but the disappointed thing is...
The Priest League like this
will not exist anymore.
Mr. Gebhardt,
have you ever think once?
What will happen if the war failed?
This is our war, Mr. Kremer.
This is a Crusade.
We have to keep praying,
use weapon to arm our soldiers.
Otherwise, what covering us will only be chaos
I pray for the brothers of my inside
the prison camps
for my family, for Luxembourg. German has a great
interest in the conversation with Vatican Pope.
Think and respect
to the Luxembourg's wills.
It's just your cardinal pope declined -
you want me to disobey the cardinal pope?
no, we just hope you can make
him regain his rationality
and also the bell from the great church.
He does not do any good things for Luxembourg.
He just holds the abolished policies in hands.
For example: Heydrich.
But there is another activity
going in our party.
Church will be kept as people
wished and find a new way
In Russian, they need missionary,
to preach to the people there
Please sit down, we can have a good talk about
this problem... - This statue is in your office.
It has no single effect on me.
Virgin Mary did not know,
the child in her arms...
...would be crucified someday
Where will you end it, priest?
What will your mother say
about all of this?
The martyr?
Read this
Please read it out loudly!
We, the conclavists of Luxemburg...
...are advocates
of the Nazi's church policy
We announce this in the name
of our truthful faith
This is for our
holy church's existence
only we stand in the side of the 3rd Reich and
its monarch Adolf Hitler, this can be possible
Please give it to the conclavist
If you don't receive a invitation
go to the parochial purser.
He's a wise man,
he should be affected by this.
Your sis is pregnant,
do you know that?
I don't know.
How do you know it?
Goodbye! Take a good consideration.
There's not much days left of your holidays.
Bless us, holy Mary
Sir, I must talk to the conclavist
I'm afraid it can be difficult.
He's in bad health.
It's about all lives
of the priests in Luxemburg!
The conclavist's on your side.
Your pain is his too.
And it's also the whole Vatican's pain.
But excuse me, I can't let you present
yourself before him.
Then which side are you on? The conclavist will
listen to you, won't he? Please don't do this!
I can only give him advice. I have the thing
which Gebhardt'd like to give to the conclavist.
I can deliver it.
No, I must talk to him.
I'll see what I can do to help you.
Henry, I'll try my best.
Dear mother,
I don't know who I shall confess to.
I didn't know what the thirst's like before.
The sun can be so dreadful.
They didn't give us water in the camp.
This kind of pain is indescribable.
We were holed up in a labor camp...
...working for a powder mill.
I don't know how to describe this...
At that moment, my heart halted.
I was dubitative, how can
there be water in that pipe?
You must talk to Henry,
he'll listen to you!
Tell him that...
Tell him what?
The Gestapo won't compromise.
What on earth do they want from him?
He puts us in grum danger.
You must know this!
Maria, talk to him
What can I tell him?
Ask him go back to the Dachau camp?
You want he lose his family just because us?
You just want this, don't you?
You're pregnant!
Don't pretend that you don't care.
My late mother always said...
He is our guardian angel.
I really hope you can be like him,
just a little bit like him.
Henry!
Henry!
Henry...
Henry, let go!
It's me, Henry!
What are you doing?
Henry! Let go!
Henry!
Wake up... Henry
Henry
Good morning.
Captain Gebhardt now has an appointment.
You have to wait for a while.
Good morning.
Please take a seat. What a pity,
it's cold in this restaurant.
What do you want to taste?
Be my guest.
How about some scrambled eggs?
It's pretty delicious here.
I'm honored that you came,
some coffee? - Okay
I seldom come to Luxemburg.
I've settled in Lorraine.
For better steel supply
to your weaponry production
Only prepare breakfast for this mister!
- Yes, sir.
Our consul in France, Otto Abetz, he
collects lots of information about you.
You've been to Paris to attend the economic
conference of the conquered country.
In the meeting, you were asked
to improve productivity
And you said to Abetz: Mr. consul,
this is difficult for me, because my
brother's being imprisoned in a camp prison.
Mr. Kremer, if it was not me, your brother
was still in the Dachau camp.
He'll be sent back there soon.
I'm glad to help your brother.
He can be useful in the church.
Only if he'd like to. I don't know a darned
thing about the church's problem.
I only know something about the
carrying trade. For example...
I know you're lack of construction material,
steel, aviation, fuel...
Berlin lets yourselves solve them.
Perhaps I can give you some help.
You get a very high position,
though you're still very young,
You have to consider those issues!
Do you want to do business with me?
We come here not for discussing this.
Thanks.
I only hope, this talk will be a secret
just between two sane men.
If I give the chief of the French Economic
Bureau a call, tell him...
...what you said to me just now. Do you
think what consequence it would be?
You'll put your brother right back
into the camp yourself.
You're right, the egg is yum indeed!
Hail Hitler, captain, just a moment...
Mr. Kremer, I didn't see you.
Please come in!
Good Morning!
Please take a seat.
What did he say?
I didn't see him.
I don't mean the conclavist.
What's the meaning of the song?
It's my wife's favourite song.
But I don't know its meaning.
You know both languages,
can you translate it?
What?
Beautiful memory...
Please wait a minute!
The night full of bright stars...
I don't understand
Charming memory...
Sweet dream...
Sweet dream...
And moonlight shining on the surface of
the ocean. Thanks, my wife's gonna love this
I'm very sorry that you
didn't see the conclavist
He's sick! I don't know
if he's gonna see me or not
But nonetheless
I know just what he'll say
Luxemburg is not
a Judas's country
Do you know what my mentor did to me?
Judas... This treacherous action I've been
doing for a long time
It's a fascinating phenomenon!
Jesus and Judas,
they're like brothers.
They depend on each other.
But Judas betrayed Jesus
for thirty silver coins.
But he didn't take any,
he threw them away into a temple.
It implies that he didn't betray Jesus for money.
Judas is cursed! God forsook him.
That's what we learnt
in our religion course.
I think Judas is devout.
Maybe the devoutest disciple of all time.
Yes, he's also an idealist.
Just like any Jewish liberator.
With the help of Jesus, he planned a rebellion
against the king, the country and the bishop.
Please say no more!
What are those theological
discussion for?
I have no interests in discussing
my belief with you.
Your holiday does its job.
You become more direct!
That's great!
It makes your speaking vivid.
My mother wished me
to become a priest.
A priest just like you. She also hoped
I could gain honors for my family.
Her son's serving in church,
which'll make her very pride.
A priest is just a Jack-a-Lent.
She knew this very well.
She was very devout.
But she's also
just a mortal on earth.
She once sent me to
a dance school to study.
I've tried my best to avoid becoming
a priest, not for her.
I always believe that you can become
what you want to become.
It's not vital whether you're
in camp prison or not.
Please go and persuade the conclavist.
Like what Judas did to the bishop?
Yes! Judas was an adventurous man.
He wanted to change the world.
He thought Jesus was the king of the world.
But God appointed him other mission.
Betrayal doesn't belong to God's holy plan.
It's just a small step in the plan.
The Holy Bible says, Judas is the strongest
apostle. He can accomplish this errand.
No Judas, no crucifix.
Then there's also no God's salvation.
You mean, "no Judas, no church"?
You understand what I mean.
On the contrary, the conclavist
doesn't accept these new thoughts.
What Judas did is an enlightenment.
Please consider it.
It will be a helpful
experience for you.
It changes me a lot.
May peace be with you...
...forever, amen.
Hail Hitler.
Henry, get in.
You must leave quickly! Come to Paris with me.
You can hide there...
...and continue working for the French.
Or you can go to Genevese, I can help you.
Find the Red Cross!
I can't abandon you.
Listen, you're bluffing now!
You lost your car?
I demand his personal explanation!
Lost? - We tracked them down
all the way to the stronghold.
The army blocked the road, we had to stop.
When the road was opened, it was too late.
I have your personal assurance!
Stop! I'll take you to a safe place in
despite of you like it or not
You must stop.
Are you nuts?
Yes, I am!
A prisoner of the camp is on his holiday.
A group of Gestapoes with cigars
in their mouths track me down.
Do you know what they want from me?
They want to destroy my belief!
They want me to betray my church.
"No Judas, no Jesus. " Do you understand?
Only the strong one can survive the camp prison.
Only the cunning man can achieve his goal.
Only like this, a man can find a way out for all.
As for you, two weeks at most.
You'll need a linkman in the kitchen.
Only he can feed you.
You will know how people die in
a labor camp after four weeks.
Yes, for surviving,
people must think carefully.
You can, but I can't.
What's up?
You leave from my house, quickly!
What are you looking for?
Who are you?
What do you want?
No other persons.
Now what to do?
Where's your brother?
I warn you, tell us
whatever you know at once
If he gets away, I'll arrest you.
Tell us everything!
I don't know where he is.
Arrest her!
Let me put on my overcoat.
There's no need for you anymore.
Leave.
How can you do this to my sis,
my brother and my sis's husband?
Isn't it enough for just arresting me?
Must our whole family go to camp prison?
What the heck are you worrying about?
Me? My family?
Or the whole Luxemburg?
I'm dreadful sorry for bringing
so much trouble to you.
You're my brother!
I thought you went
to Paris with Irmgard.
He went there alone.
I saw him off.
Dear mother
The next night there's only one single
thing in my mind. And that's water.
Do not move, you filth prisoner!
Take off your hat!
Number off!
I keep asking myself whether I should
share this with my brothers.
Or just tell Nansen,
who's the weakest among us.
I pray to God, but the pain of thirst
is stronger than anything.
The next day I come there again.
There's not much water.
But it's enough for one person.
Warm, a little bit salt.
It's so wonderful.
It moistens my dry lips,
it's so tasteful. - Kremer?
Kremer?
Go back to your row.
The chief warden's looking for you.
At that monment I comprehended
I was a sinner.
I was a greedy selfish sinner.
Water, water!
Don't give up. Listen, don't give up!
I'm not gonna make it!
God is testing us!
God's with us!
It's ok...
It's ok...
God trusts us!
Kremer
Merciful God, forgive me, forgive me.
Only like this, again and again.
Mother, forgive me.
Yes, I survive...
Nansen dies...
The question haunts me all the time.
Those water...
If I shared those water with him,
would he survive?
After that, I saw his face
in my dream every night.
I followed his steps.
Why don't say something?
You're not responsible
for your friend's death.
You just think
you could have saved him.
And he didn't blame you either.
The encyclical says...
All the buring pain will burn out.
The Nazi violently betrayed
Jesus Christ.
Hatred and blood spreads everywhere.
Please believe me.
Since the very first day,
I've just wanted to hug Kremer.
But if Gebhardt asked him to come,
then I cannot see him.
And that's also because of him.
This is an announcement which the Vatican
sends to the Berlin Reich Security Office HQ.
For seeking for building a new type
of European church policy.
The denial of this chance
is a loss to Luxemburg.
If only Luxemburg agreed the bishop's
resolution that day and...
expressed to support Nazi's church policy,
then it would be a trophy to Berlin.
Alienating the relationship between Rome and us.
I told Kremer about this.
But as the conclavist, you should have
much more resource to manipulate.
When will Kremer end his
so-called "holiday"?
In three days.
What's your opinion?
Is it just a fate for one single priest?
Or for other reasons?
You can't help me anymore...
Sir.
Please come in.
Do you get any message
from the Bishop?
No?
Then please be more!
You don't come here for relaxation.
You can go back today!
Yes, he's a patient.
I hope he die as soon as possible. It would
settle everything with the parochial purser.
This damn poor sow priest!
Sow priest? - He's the spiritual
mentor of the whole Luxemburg.
In my opinion, he's just a poor worm
who's crimpling in his robe all day.
You and I, we're aboveboard.
Or maybe there're other people?
I think I know what you're thinking.
Say something
I think you know nothing about this!
Under your order, what's going on there
in the camp prison?
You think you would know everything
about the camp prison if you just
had a talk with its commander?
What do you know? Thousands of German soldiers
died in the east line.
This is the monarch's command.
This is God's wish.
Why don't you become a priest?
You finally asked
a good question.
A glass of water?
I've read your doctorial thesis,
it's really nice.
There are so much proof
to prove God's existence.
The subject is a limelight.
But it felt wonderful to throw a boomerang.
Truly.
It's a philosophical sport.
Whatever you throw away,
it'll go back to you.
Mister Gebhardt, the conclavist
doesn't want to see me.
Even if he does, he'll never
agree to sign. Never
We don't care about him!
Follow me!
You write this down:
Luxemburg belongs to the Reich.
One country, one Roman Catholicism.
German church policy...
doesn't violate the Vatican. The Catholic
priests of Luxemburg support this policy.
You, Priest Kremer announce
it publicly.
You criticize the conclavist publicly.
You must finish this by tomorrow.
Just two days before
I left the seminary
I denied to wear the black uniform,
this is my own action against God.
Yes.
I was vice officiant at that time.
As a priest, can I change this world?
I can't.
Can I make this world a better place? I can't
either. But in the camp of our monarch...
Under his great lead, I feel like I'm
important.
I drive the wheel of the history to run, and I've
already done it in my heart for a long time.
My faith gives me strength to accomplish
all of my errands.
Judas!
You are it!
- Ah, finally you get it!
I think you just comprehended the
true meaning of Judas.
Why don't you drink up the water? Back
in the camp, you should have drunk it up already.
Although you didn't say it,
but I know.
You betrayed your brothers in arms,
for surviving.
You finally make your life
meaningful.
If I did what you told me, what would happen
to my brothers in the camp prison?
You don't believe
the justice of God?
Everyone cooperate with us
will be set free.
Be set free?
Yes, just get his agreement.
You should write for living,
not for dead.
Your fate is on your hand
I am waiting for your compellent report.
Just as the wonderful article
which against law of race.
Sorry, Henry.
Go ahead, I wait here.
We just excrete only once one day
in the concentration camp and finish
it in one minute, if we don't finish it
he will face the menace of death.
Doctor is the best of us,
he can finish it in just 10 sec.
Why didn't you go to Switzerland?
We can help you.
Raymond knew a guy of Germany Railroad,
please try it.
You knew some friends of Bodensee
so you can hide over there for some days
and you can swim to the other bank
so that's Switzerland.
I am sorry to bother so earlier
is the father Kremer here? - Yes.
Henry, do you think
I am a bad man, right?
No
But a caitiff?
Somtimes people have
no choice except recreance.
Trust me, I knew it.
I have been always asking myself
since you are back, why...
You can bring me courage?
But not anyone can do this.
You should be around of exarch. You have
responsibility of the whole church of Luxemburg.
I have no power to criticize you.
Cardinal is waiting for us.
I have family too.
Somtimes I will consider them
more than church.
Me too.
Father, glad to see you.
Glad to see you too.
You look good, that's great.
Now, there are some problems of diplomatism.
Come here, father, sit down.
Sir, I am in a rough situation
I must make a decision.
Mersch has told me,
I have nothing to suggest
but as a father you must know
in the soup,
people should defer conscience.
So, please defer vocation
of conscience, believe god,
let holy belief help you.
Please forgive me, but I have asked
my conscience for million times
I asked for god, but I got nothing.
I come here with full of hope.
Sir, I need your help.
You reject my suggestion?
- Please try to understand me!
My brother of concentration camp was killed on the
cross. It's true! There is a cross on their back.
There is no god in that place
where I came from.
I have never been off this house,
since being occupied by Germany.
I have never had conversation with the
chief of staff of the occupied army.
Yes, I made the jow of church loud
all of Luxemburg knew the reason.
The spirit of god
spread everywhere.
Maybe the spirit of god fill with...
- Father...
I don't want to know
what Gebhardt ask you do.
You are imposed by him
but if you have any doubt
of church...
I have never been suspicious of church
but I suspect god sometimes.
Do you know every thing
happened in Holland?
Nazi killed
all Christian of non-Aryan.
Dejong, the local cardinal give up.
He published a cardinal announce
all Christian of non-Aryan in that area
were killed more than 40000 people
What do you think
what did Papacy do?
Just one cardinal announce
kill 40000 people.
How did it work for your demurral?
But I should...
Should I become Judas?
Is this Gebhardt ask you do?
Yes.
There is something you don't know.
I should not tell you there.
Gebhardt made me get into
a big puzzledom of conscience.
Really?
He used work in a concentration camp
in east, he said that's for democracy.
When I asked him what did he do,
he answered,
nothing, but I knew it.
No! No! Stop.
I am so glad, everyone has
the good rhythm today, right?
If there is a litter flute
that will be better.
Gebhardt...
You deal with it.
Come on.
How about it?
The people who believe god believe that Jesus
is righteous, so he has to do it, hasn't he?
It seems that you suspect god
more than me, father.
Here you are.
Father, you are a smart guy.
You save your life
and save your family's too.
You also save all priests' lives
of Luxemburg's church.
I always ask during the period, why choose me,
why not choose the chief of main deanery.
You yourself also say
he is a smart guy.
But...
he lacks something.
He never comes into
concentration camp.
How does he know the suffer
in the concentration camp?
Behind the evil?
What do you see in the
east concentration camp?
Prisoner 25639,
Henry Kremer.
I come back.
Get out.
Henry Kremer is name that
really lived among other things.
Several thousand priestess from every country
like him were put in the concentration camp
of Dachau during World War II...
...half of them died. Kremer belonged
to them, that escaped the death.
