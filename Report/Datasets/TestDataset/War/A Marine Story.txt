- Hi.
- Hi.
So when did Frank's close down?
Oh, two years, three years ago.
- Oh?
- Yeah.
Is it OK if I
stow this here while I shop?
Uh, yeah, go ahead, honey.
Can I get a pack of smokes?
Um...sure.
What kind do you want?
What do those say right there?
These are lights.
What are those ones,
those ones down there...
Just those blue ones there.
These are menthol flavored.
The other ones there,
to the right.
$6.24 with tax.
Um...
You know what...
I forgot my money at home.
I'm gonna have to come back.
Call 911!
I will break this arm.
I will break it!
Hold still...
Hold still!
That boy is just
swirlin' down the drain.
Seems like they all are.
Didn't have meth labs around
when we were that age.
Things don't always change
for the better, I guess.
No, they don't.
I don't remember it being your job
to do something about it.
I wasn't looking
for trouble, Max.
That's not the way he tells it.
Look, four deployments would
make Gandhi trigger-happy,
so I get you
might be high-strung.
But stand down, soldier.
You gotta leave this stuff to me.
I know, it was stupid,
it won't happen again.
You've got a more
important fight.
I'd give you a lift,
but I'm a little short- handed.
It's fine.
- How long you in town?
- Couple of weeks.
Good.
Say hi to the General
when you speak to him.
I will.
Hey, Max.
There was a girl.
- Tall, brown hair?
- Yeah.
You carry any tequila?
Not open yet.
Holy crap!
Is that an Everett?
Hi, Shelly.
Alexandra Everett,
what the hell you doin' home?
Don't you know there's a war on?
How's your dad and your brother?
Everybody still got all their pieces?
Yeah, so far.
We pray for that,
yes, we do.
You're lookin'
marvelous as ever.
Thanks. You, too.
Oh, please.
Marines aren't supposed to lie.
Let me buy you a drink.
No, thanks. I just stopped by
to say hi and use the head.
OK, you know where it is.
You on foot?
I can give you a ride to the house.
No, thanks.
I need to walk off
that train ride.
Ten miles ain't a walk, honey.
That's a hike.
#
Three new messages...
Alexandra, hi,
this is Tracy Flores
from San Lucas Realty.
Could you please call me
back and just confirm
that you are there and that
i shouldn't book the house?
Thanks.
Alex, it's your father.
Been trying to reach you
on your cell, with no luck.
The realtor said something
about you staying at the house.
If you are, call me.
Hey, Alex, it's Joe.
Just heard the news.
Wow...
And we had a choice of our own -
either take the word of a madman
or take action to defend
America and the world.
Faced with that choice,
I will defend America
every time.
It's generally believed
there's been a let up in the
violence of late in Iraq -
that is until today...
The car bomb ripped through
the mostly Shiite area
of North Baghdad,
called Al Haria.
The car, parked next to
a bus stop at rush hour...
The explosion in the
mainly Shiite area
engulfed shops
and residential flats,
causing chaos and confusion
amidst the busy streets...
The meth lab explosion
in a Bear Valley home last night
has left one person dead
and another with severe burns.
It's the third meth lab
explosion this year...
Hey!
You bought this?
She's still got some life in her.
I see you put the flag up.
An Everett is home.
For now.
Take a look in my back seat.
Her name is Saffron -
Saffron Snow.
- You remember the Snows?
- Yeah.
You heard about the accident?
Drunk driver ran
a red light.
Killed both her parents
and her brother,
but somehow she walked away,
which is a friggin' miracle.
This is her grandmother.
Mrs. Snow.
Alexandra, you remember me?
Of course.
You were friends with my mother.
I haven't seen you
since she passed.
She'd be so proud of you.
She had such plans
for this place.
So look...
I was wondering
if you could help us out.
That stunt the other day
was pretty much
the last one for Saffron.
The judge gave her a choice:
Go into the military
or go to jail.
With those friends she keeps,
I'm afraid she'd choose
going to jail.
She's old enough
we're not talking Juvee, either.
She's got to the end of the
month to get her act together
and make a good impression
on a recruiter, or else.
We thought if you'd just
have a few words with her,
get her motivated.
- I'm no recruiter, Max.
- I know.
But she's a good kid, Alex.
Please...
She's stopped listening to me.
I just don't know
what else to do.
All right.
Better get her out of
that car before she cooks.
Great.
Thank you, thank you.
I know you know
how she must feel.
Now you listen to
that lady, you understand?
Hey, Max, just leave her here.
I'll run her back home later.
There's water over there
if you need it.
You learn how to
do that in the Army?
Marine Corps.
Ain't you supposed to
give me some sort of pep talk
about the military
or something?
I don't think so.
Uh, OK. Why not?
Your grandma said you
don't listen much anymore...
I don't think
I'll waste my breath
until I now I've got your
full attention.
I'm sorry, you say somethin'?
I'll tell you what.
Come back here tomorrow morning,
on your own,
and I'll help you out
If you're interested.
OK. Whatever.
You got another car?
Nope.
But you said you'd drop me back!
Oh, you heard that, did you?
All right,
then can I use your phone?
Use your legs.
I live like
five miles from here!
Shouldn't take you
too long then.
You know I didn't
steal anything!
You saw me, you know I didn't!
I was just there!
March back here
tomorrow morning, early,
without that stud
in your nose, and we'll talk.
Fuck you!
Our message to the
commanders in the field
and to our leadership is that,
based on our current
deployment model,
the troop levels
associated with the surge
cannot be sustained indefinitely.
That said, i have heard...
Here's your
Pentagon Channel Report...
Diplomatic commitments
from Iran
to help stabilize and improve
the security situation
in Iraq remain unfulfilled.
That's according
to Major General...
Everybody offered me
a lift but you.
Looks like you
need the exercise.
Hey, girl.
Get him another one,
would you?
I'll have the same.
Will we be startin' a tab then?
Yeah, why not.
So what else is going on?
You seen Holly?
I think she's livin'
up in Fresno now,
but I haven't spoken to her
since she went off to college
and you went off
to get the tattoo.
Wow...
That's been a while then.
Strange how you just
lose track of people.
At least I see the flag up
once in a while.
That's a reminder.
I should have stopped by
to say hello a lot sooner.
I'm sorry.
Ah...
You got married.
I did too.
You didn't miss much.
So...
When do you go back?
I am planning my next move...
I got my honorable discharge.
I thought they weren't
lettin' anyone out.
They are.
Yeah, but I thought
you were in for life -
family tradition and all.
Listen, if it has anything
to do with your marriage
to what's- his-name...
If he comes around here,
I'm gonna knock him down for ya.
He's a Navy SEAL, Leo.
Be a friggin' walrus,
I'll still knock him down.
He's not comin' around.
So you're out...
What next?
Exactly.
We'll have to find something
fun for you to do then.
Leo, l...
Hold that thought.
- Boys!
- Leo!
Get down here.
Somebody I want you to meet.
All right, guys, let's go.
To the troops!
To the troops!
- Ah!
- Yeah!
How would you even
know there's a war on?
They ain't raised taxes,
they lowered 'em.
Don't you read
the bumper stickers?
Yeah, and those yellow ribbons.
Those help.
So you lady Marines
all really Semper Fi and shit?
We're just called Marines.
But you still do all that
secretarial work, right?
They fly jets, idiot,
helicopters.
The only thing they
don't do is ground combat,
but that's gonna change.
Combat? No fuckin' way.
No offense, honey.
Try not to be a prick.
What Turk is saying,
in his graceful manner...
Very graceful.
...the difference between
men and women...
A gun is a great equalizer.
Yeah, yeah, but some jobs
men are just better at,
because of the muscle mass.
Muscle mass, Stenny!
It's not that women
aren't part of the team,
there's just the strength issue.
He's right.
There's that saying that
the strongest woman
is equal to the weakest man.
What?
It's true, so if we're
talking about combat...
What did you just say?
I didn't saying anything,
I'm just...
You just said that
the strongest woman
is equal to the weakest man?
Yeah.
I'd take that bet.
Dale, arm-wrestle her.
- Yeah, buddy!
- Yeah!
I'm not the weakest.
You want to go
round robin on this?
Cut to the chase.
You're it.
Woo!!!
Come on!
Lt'll be like
a little science experiment.
You got her, buddy.
Come on, baby,
make me proud.
A good clean fight...
No kicking, no biting, Dale.
I got 20 on Alex.
I got that bet.
Good. Put your money
on the table.
- Here we go.
- Ready?
One, two, wrestle.
Come on!
Put her down!
What the hell?!
What happened?
Well, we put that
theory to rest, boys.
Yeah, wait, wait!
I get shot, she can't
carry me off the field.
I can't carry you off the field.
All right, let's test this with a real man.
A lefty!
All right, hold on, hold on.
You know what, guys?
I think we proved the point.
- Alex, my compliments.
- Thank you.
- I'm buying.
- That's my money.
Cool!
The front line is just about
anywhere you drive a HumVee,
so women are
in combat every day.
But you can relax.
It's not gonna be
official policy any time soon.
I had a buddy who was a Marine,
and the women Marines...
well, all the other grunts
called them W. M.'s.
Waste of money.
- That's what he said.
- Jesus, Turk.
He's really not our friend.
- That's what he said.
- It's all right.
We have an all-volunteer military
that's stretched pretty thin
and they'll take pretty much
anyone they can get,
so I'd say if you're
not gonna join up,
you can shut the fuck up.
Well, she's got you there, bud.
What'd I miss?
Where are you going?
There's your difference
right there, boys...
Bladder the size of an acorn.
How's that?
He just decked her!
She shoved me!
What's goin' on?
All right, darlin', that's enough.
They hand out balls
to the lady Marines, too?
Everybody calm the hell down!
- Turk, stay away from her!
- Screw that,
I'm tired of this
toy soldier bullshit!
I said back off!
Jesus! Just chill out!
Go sit down.
Now you can hit me.
I said, sit down!
I'm callin' the police!
Turk!
Hey, Turk!
God!
Sorry, Mom.
What I'm about to say is
extremely confusing to me,
and I'm sure will
come as a shock.
You're being investigated for
conduct unbecoming an officer.
What?
Specifically, homosexual conduct.
That's absurd.
Emails describing the nature of
a relationship have been discovered.
Sir, I have sent no emails.
You received them -
on a military email account.
Junk mail, immediately deleted.
- Apparently there's other evidence.
- What evidence?
That'll come out in the hearing.
I'm just informing you that
the process is in motion.
But who put the
process in motion?
It doesn't matter.
Sir, I have the right
to know my accuser.
Doesn't work that way, Alex.
Look, hopefully we can
clear this up
when the board of inquiry
is convened.
But you should know,
if they do find against you,
you might end up
with something worse than
an honorable discharge,
which you'd still get
if you decide
to separate before the hearing.
So, just keep that in mind.
Sir, with respect,
this whole thing is ridiculous.
I'm married.
Yes, I know.
It doesn't matter.
What am i doing?!
Dammit.
God dammit.
Anybody in there?
Hello?
Hey, Marine lady!
You better be home after
making me walk all this way.
Did you walk?
Or am I gonna find your car
at the bottom of the hill?
I walked!
OK...
Let's see if you're lying.
OK, so I drove.
I was gonna be late.
All right, now you get
to clean all the crap
off the driveway from here
to wherever your car is.
Yeah, right.
Listen, I'm here, OK?
So just give me
some talk or whatever.
Talk is cheap,
but it ain't free.
Oh, my God...
You're insane.
No, I just know that talk
ain't gonna work
on a meth head
with an attitude problem.
I am not a meth head.
Look, you're gonna wash out
of bootcamp your very first day
and end up in
a prison cell, or worse.
I can get you ready,
but I told you I'm not
gonna waste my time.
So either give me
total submission or get gone.
There's a rake and
garbage bags in the garage.
What a major bitch.
Punk.
I got you water.
Saffron?
And breathe, ladies.
Extend through the fingertips,
lift the back thigh up,
opening the hips and breathe.
Strong pose, fire pose.
Find some water in the pose,
find some flexibility
in the pose...
Somebody smile, somebody smile...
Extend and...
reverse crescent
and up over,
reversing the palm...
and looking up...
Breathe.
Hold the position.
The crazy thing is,
I didn't realize
until after I enlisted.
At that point you kinda
keep it to yourself
if you like your job...
I loved my job.
God, I feel like we should go
get a drink or something...
I've got to go teach.
I gotta head back anyway.
I just thought
I was gonna lose it
if I didn't tell
somebody the truth.
You can keep it a secret, right?
Yeah, yeah.
What about your family?
No, they don't need to know.
Not while my brother's deployed.
Not while my father's
still alive.
Leo?
This needs to stay
between us, OK?
Of course.
You know, I always
thought you had
a little crush
on me in high school.
Uh uh...
Oh!
Your crush on Leo didn't
do you much good, either.
No thanks to you.
What a confused and frustrated
little triangle that was.
Yeah.
Hey...
You've got your ring
on the wrong hand.
Is that some kind of code?
No...
I just broke this finger.
It won't fit anymore.
Does your husband know?
I'm just here to
pay for the damages.
It's been taken care of.
Leo?
What's he drinkin'?
You rack.
I get a little dizzy bending over.
Garbage!
Garbage... is gold!
You ain't got a shot now.
Hey!
You forfeit the game that way.
Shooting willy nilly is silly.
Fine.
Forfeit then.
We don't train
to shoot half-cocked.
Half-crocked, you mean.
You're fully crocked.
I can't do it. I won't.
So, I'm going home.
And I'm not even gonna drive,
because that's just
a bigger bullet.
I salute that wise decision.
As you were.
Hang a right out the door
and keep walking
until you see your mailbox.
Night, Turk!
W. M...
stands for Walkin' Marine!
Ooo-rah!
I used to drive a Chevrolet...
Now I'm walkin' everyday...
I used to drive a Cadillac...
Now I'm humpin' with my pack...
If i die in a combat zone...
Box me up and ship me home!
Close Combat Instructor,
Drill Sergeant,
Amphibious Warfare
School graduate...
Top marks all around.
And a Mustang to boot.
Just so we're clear,
I don't see how
you being a lesbian
makes a damn bit of difference.
I am not a lesbian.
And I didn't just
ask you if you were.
I'm just following the assumption.
We fight side by side with the
British and they let the gays in
so, believe me,
I know how stupid this is.
Yes, sir.
Certainly you've had to deal
with this issue in your command,
haven't you?
I had two men tell me they
were in love with each other
right after September 11th.
How did you handle it?
I told them to kiss.
They couldn't.
And you left it there?
They were just afraid
of what was coming.
They got over it.
So they stayed in the fight.
See, that's the issue,
right there.
If a homosexual is allowed
to stay in the fight,
maybe die in the fight,
there's no way in hell
some politician can tell 'em
who they can or can't marry.
You see what I mean?
It's not a matter of unit cohesion
or troop morale.
It's about the damn
marriage issue...
Respectfully,
I appreciate your insight,
but I really, really
don't care about this crap.
At ease, Major.
I just want to be
free to do my job, sir.
Now is not the time
to be losing any Marine,
that's certain.
Is there a way to
at least push this off
until I'm eligible for
my pension next year?
I'll see if I can
slow the wheels.
I'd appreciate whatever
you can do on my behalf, sir.
Got your back.
Dismissed.
Corpsman up!
Corpsman!
You got a man down
over here...
Bone check.
All good.
Hotel, Echo, Lima, Papa!
This is Devilfish 1-2
calling medevac.
I'm hit!
Anybody copy?
I said I'm hit!
Where is everybody?
Where is everybody?
What a bender you're on.
Well, come on in.
The first thing you're gonna
see when you get off the bus
is a line of yellow footmarks.
You put your feet on them.
Stand at attention, like this.
Eyes and head
straight to the front.
Don't look in my eyes.
Look straight front.
Do not ever make eye contact.
It will be late in the evening.
You will be tired and hungry
and disoriented.
And that's exactly
the way they want you,
because for the next few hours
every manifestation of what you
consider to be your identity
will be stripped away.
Your clothing, your hairstyle,
your mannerisms,
speech patterns,
bad habits, everything.
They get in your face and call
you maggot even if you're a girl?
Yes.
- Show me.
- No.
Sheriff said you were
a drill instructor once.
Let's see it.
No.
Do it.
Call me a maggot.
You know you want to.
Ever since you saw me
you've had it out for me.
So just do it.
It's not like you haven't already
been a major bitch anyway.
I'm curious to see...
Curious will get you killed, recruit!
From now on, everything you
need to know I will tell you!
Everything you think
you know, you will forget!
Did I not just explain to you
how to stand at attention?
Shoulders back!
How old are you, Snow?
- Uh, 20.
- Uh? Uh?
We do not say 'uh'
in the Marine Corps.
Uh is something you hear
from little lady meth- heads
who sell their twats for a fix.
You sell your twat
for a fix, Snowblind?
Uh, no...
I mean no!
You will answer me
ma'am, yes ma'am.
Do you understand me?
- Ma'am, yes, ma'am.
- Ma'am, yes, ma'am.
Did it take you 20 years to
get this stupid, Snowflake?
- OK.
- Hey!
Did I tell you
to step off your marks?
Why are you not
standing on your marks?
Do you need
your fix, Snowblind,
or are you just ready to
run home to grandma?
All right, I get it, OK!
Stop it, stop it!
Holy shit!
I am not a meth- head!
I've never even tried it!
I'm just being hard on you
so you're not completely
unprepared for boot camp.
What I've been describing here
is day one
with the Marine Corps.
The Marine Corps is
the toughest, the elite.
With you I think we try Air Force.
Where you goin'?
Aspirin.
What's next, Major Bitch?
That's not bad.
Don't stop!
You said a mile.
Yeah, but we gotta
time you for three.
Keep goin'!
Go, go, go!
Move! Go!
Come on, love it, do it...
Just go until your body stops.
Don't listen to your mind.
Good.
Come on, stay up there, stay.
Come on, come on!
Well, you didn't pass the
minimum physical requirements,
but you did better
than I thought you would.
Really?
Rule number one...
Never smile within sight
of your drill Instructor.
You have no right looking
happy in boot camp.
And if you do look happy,
they'll remedy the situation.
Used to be a beauty queen...
Now I got my M-16...
They're gonna hound you all day,
make you make mistakes.
You're gonna feel
worthless sometimes,
but that's the
enemy you fight.
You're not worthless,
you're just learning.
You OK?
Get some rest,
I'll see you tomorrow morning.
- Leo.
- Saff.
What happened to your face?
Managed to get hit
with a razor this time.
What are you doing with her?
Little project.
Well, I came over
to offer another apology
over the idiocy
that happened the other night.
This is the idiot maker.
How 'bout some coffee?
- If you say so.
- C'mon.
What?
Just... memories.
I got a shoebox full of those.
C'mon.
Hey, you wanna ride?
No, thanks.
Just go on.
Don't slam the door.
Food's on the counter.
I spoke to your mother.
She said don't worry,
everyone is just fine.
Said to make sure
I told you that.
Do you hear me?
Yes.
Saffron...
Don't worry.
Everyone is gonna be just fine.
Help is comin'...
Help is...
There's no bikes in boot camp!
Come on!
My legs are toast!
You will fall down,
but you will get up.
You will be pushed beyond
your limits, but you will comply
because you have no idea
what your limits are.
I'm at my limit.
- Are you gonna puke?
- No.
Then you're nowhere
near your limit.
Come on, keep moving.
Let's go!
- I can't...
- Can't? That's not a word.
Seriously...
Seriously, I will go full
Drill Instructor on you.
Oh, no, please don't.
Then block the mind chatter.
This is about willpower now.
Are you listening?
- Ears!
- Open, ma'am.
Then take your eyes,
put them on the horizon
and go there!
Outstanding!
You have been a zombie maggot
your entire life,
and now thanks to your country
you're starting to wake up.
- Say thank you!
- Ma'am, thank you, ma'am.
That's right!
Ma'am, thank you, Ma'am.
Don't let me
get ahead of you.
Stay in front of me
or I will own this bike.
This bike is mine!
OK, I surrender.
Can you swim?
Captain of the swim team
in high school.
Maybe we'll ship you
off to the Navy.
So...
You're friends with Leo?
Yeah.
Uh huh.
Old boyfriend?
High school.
He shaved for you.
Right.
Is Burner your boyfriend?
I guess he was.
They're all just boys, you know.
I don't know what they're doin'
and I don't wanna take
the time to figure it out.
I just want a little
squeeze here,
a little massage there,
a little exploration.
Not all that jack-hammerin'!
Is that too much to ask?
Ahhh!
And you brought
civilization with you.
How nice.
- Should I open it?
- Yes. Quickly.
I'll get some glasses.
You seem tense.
What's up?
I'm standing in your house...
I got dressed up...
I brought a gift.
I hope you don't think
I'm hitting on you.
Are you?
No...
- Aww...
- Oh, God, no.
Am I?
Girl, you're a hot mess.
It's OK to cry.
Marines don't cry;
their eyeballs sweat.
Is this a dance club?
Can be.
There aren't any men in here.
I know...
Every night is ladies night.
- Someone might see us.
- That's the whole idea.
Let's go!
You've never been
in a gay bar before.
Of course not.
But you've mingled...
with the ladies.
Tequila!
Whoa, sailor, relax.
We're just here
to meet a friend.
I don't want to meet anybody.
Let's just go.
Relax.
It's just someone
I work with at the yoga studio.
Oh! There she is.
Then you became a what?
A Deputy Provost Marshall.
It's like a cop.
Oh...
Iraq is mostly about policing now.
Seems like they
had you doing a lot.
A lot of opportunity there.
You think?
Two wars.
I'm sorry.
I gotta come right out
and ask you something.
What?
Did you vote for George Bush?
No.
Good.
There's really only
one answer to that question.
Actually, I don't vote
for presidents.
The Commander in Chief
is the Commander in Chief.
I find it's best not to
get invested in outcomes.
Is that answer still OK?
Yes.
You don't think Holly minded
when we ditched her?
No.
And it didn't seem too obvious
when we left together?
Who cares?
Mmm...
You are hungry, aren't you?
Where are you going?
Alex, what's going on?
Are you all right?
It's just my roommate.
Calm down.
Come on, talk to me.
Alex, come back to bed.
- Sir.
- Shut the door.
When I said I had your back,
I thought we understood each other.
That's why your promotion
was held up.
The fact that your father
retired with two stars
probably kept anything
else from happening.
Sir, that person was
a very close friend of mine.
- Anybody can see that!
- No, just a friend.
I was shipping out
the next morning,
we were saying goodbye.
You got caught, Alex.
I was drunk.
And that's what you're gonna
tell the board of inquiry?
Yes.
OK...
We'll say you were well hammered
and taken advantage of,
or some latent feelings
were unlocked by the booze,
but that you're straight.
A bit confused, but straight.
Yes, exactly.
And those emails were
a prank of some kind.
Her fantasy, not mine.
It would help
if we had more proof.
Proof, sir?
The burden lies with you, Alex.
Aside from my already
being married,
what exactly are we
talking about here?
Have you been faithful?
Is there any man on base who can
put this whole thing to rest?
Adultery is also illegal, sir.
How would that help me?
Call it the lesser of two evils.
Hey!
Yeah, baby!
Yeah! USA is number one!
Hey, gorgeous...
Wanna make some lunch money?
Burner... You made bail.
How about that?
Thought you'd pitch in a buck.
You didn't even come to visit.
Yeah... Sorry.
Where are you headed?
Nowhere. Just around.
I'm goin' that way.
Hop in.
I don't want any trouble.
There's no trouble.
Listen, I can't even
be seen talking with you.
I'm sorry.
Cut her off!
I must have been gone too long.
Let me reintroduce myself.
Hi.
Whoaaa!
That is way overdosin'
on the Kool-Aid, yo.
Don't say yo.
Ma'am, yes, ma'am,
but jiminy.
What happened to you?
Nothin'.
What did this?
Tree branch.
Tree branch with fingers?
Think you can teach me
some karate moves?
Yeah.
Wait. You leavin'?
I don't know what I was doing.
Pick that up.
Put your hands on my shoulders.
If someone's gonna
grab your shoulders,
first thing is you smack
and grab here on the wrist...
Put your arm
on top of my arm.
Yeah, that's it.
If you're choking,
the first thing is to
turn your head
so you can breathe...
Put your hand down along
this seam and fold it over...
E- 5, Sergeant, :
E- 6, Staff Sergeant, :
E-7, Master Sergeant...
No.
E-7 is Gunnery Sergeant.
Right.
E-8, Master Sergeant
and First Sergeant;
E-9, Master Gunnery Sergeant
and Sergeant Major...
Give me 20 pushups.
Oh, come on,
all the way down.
Yeah!
Call me maggot now, bitch!
Turn it, twist it, pop...
I'll see you bright and early.
Ma'am, yes, ma'am!
So what's the deal
with this house?
Your dad doesn't seem
to wanna live here...
You don't wanna hang around.
The General is happier
in Florida with his cronies.
And I'm not ready
to settle down yet.
Why don't you just sell it?
My mom's ashes are here.
- How many times have you gone?
- Three.
How many are you gonna do?
One more than my body
tells me I can.
That was in the mailbox.
Hey, don't wear your legs out!
We're goin' to a party!
It's a good idea you had.
Thanks for goin' along with it.
She's on my team.
No arguments, birthday boy.
I tried to invite Dale.
I was hopin' we could make up
and all be friends,
but no one's seen him.
Well, how about this
for a replacement?
Leo?
Holly?
Hey, you.
Am I the only one
gettin' older around here?
- No.
- You haven't changed a bit.
Yes, she has.
She never would have done
something like this
back in the day -
our little granola girl.
- What's up, Marine?
- Hey!
Ready to play?
Green team get ready!
Red team get ready!
OK, everybody, don't bunch up,
but always keep a teammate
within eyesight.
Let's paint these losers!
Here we go...
You might want to
tuck your head down.
Hey, beanpole.
That came outta nowhere.
Usually does.
Get your hand up.
That wasn't nice.
Happy birthday, Leo.
Hey, Stenny.
Fuck!
Stenny!
I'm on your team!
Oops!
You're outta there!
- Sorry, OK?
- Fuck.
That was quick.
Friendly fire.
Yellow...
Looks like alien blood.
Better than the red stuff.
I don't know, you know...
I mean, workin' out,
makin' beds, gettin' yelled at -
that's one thing.
But killin' people,
that's something else.
I can't even get
a spider out of the tub.
The military is gonna
train you to do lots of things.
Non-killer stuff.
I think there's only a week of
rifle training in the Air Force.
Still...
I just don't think
I have it in me.
That impulse, or instinct,
or whatever it is.
Yeah, baby, eat paint!
The green team is drunk drivers.
The red team is your family...
Alive.
Damn!
Bastard!
I'm out!
New game!
Stenny, you head up
the left flank.
Everyone, if you stick
in one spot too long
you just broadcast
your position.
Turk? Turk?!
Keep movin'... I got it.
Let's go.
Keep your head down
and check your colors before you shoot.
Don't shoot your teammate.
Go, go!
Yes.
That's my girl.
Saffron, keep moving!
Move up! I'll cover you!
Ow!!!
Holly?
That's for your
next birthday, sunshine.
Leo, you son of a bitch!
Holly, we're on the same team!
Get him!
Try not to get paint everywhere!
It's more like colored
egg whites or something.
Try not to get eggs everywhere.
Stenny, which one is red?
He can't tell you that.
He's color blind,
ain't you, Stenny?
You shot me twice
in the back!
My aim just really sucks.
Here you go.
Wait, hold on.
She's got a big day tomorrow.
I'm taking her down
to the recruiting station.
- Excuse me?
- It's time.
You sure about that?
Yep, you're strong enough now.
Not quite as much of a punk
as she used to be either.
I don't know about that.
Seriously, though...
After everything you've
been through,
after all you've survived,
that is saying a hell of a lot.
To Saffron...
I think you've already made
a lot of people very proud.
To Saffron!
Hey, she's gotta
have a beer now!
Her eyeballs are sweating.
Awwww...
Girls are awesome.
I'm gonna drop her at home.
Save my chair for me.
Gentlemen...
Attention!
Aw...
At ease.
I'll go with you, hold on.
And leave Holly alone
with this wolf pack?
Mmmm...
That girl was a train-wreck
three weeks ago.
Alex really shaped her up,
didn't she?
You shoulda married her, boss.
It should be clear
to all by now, Stenny,
that I'm nowhere near worthy.
Screw that.
She never really
liked you anyway.
- True.
- Thanks, Bill.
Has anyone ever
met her husband?
Should i come in
and talk to your grandma?
No, she'll be way in
her cups by now.
I'll pick you up around ten then?
I think I'll march
up to your place.
It'll help take the edge off.
Just don't wear those clothes
and everything will be fine.
What if I'm not ready?
They'll make you ready.
That's their job.
What if I don't make it?
Well, as my mom used to say,
"Failure ain't the falling down,
it's the staying down."
She died when I
was around your age.
I don't know if you knew that.
I did.
Heard she was a real beauty.
She was.
- Get some sleep.
- I'll try.
What the hell is this?
I was waitin' around
hoping you'd tell me.
So...
Tell me.
Is all that true?
What the fuck have you done?
Come on.
Flag's flyin'!
We're home!
Whoa!
What's with all the carpeting?
We'll take a tour tomorrow.
Come on, you can
sleep in Nicky's room.
Nicky... How's he doing?
He's giving 'em hell.
I want to ask you abut Saffron.
What?
Why are you
sending her away to them,
after what they did to you?
When somebody falls,
somebody's gotta take their place.
You didn't fall.
I left them one short.
Which one?
C'mon, take those clothes off.
They're filthy.
I gotta pee.
OK, c'mon, it's this way.
Ahhh!!!
What is it!
You got shot.
Oh, I thought I had measles...
You're OK.
Oooh, your neck...
Yeah, I know.
Let me see what you got.
Damn, you're a leopard!
Stenny fragged you good.
He kissed my hand
after you left.
Leo?
Yes.
And now I kiss you.
OK...
Now everybody's happy...
Everybody gets what they wanted.
That's nice.
- Come on.
- Where you going?
To bed.
Oh, no.
OK.
Go to sleep.
She late?
Yeah.
Why don't you go get her?
No.
Horse to water kind of thing?
Basically.
I think I drunk-dialed Leo
last night.
Uh, oh.
And I offer a blanket mea culpa
for any other stupidity
that may have transpired.
You didn't break anything.
So, what's next for you?
I gotta get a job.
I was just short of my pension.
God, those idiots.
I wish ignorance was painful.
Where are you?
OK...
Give me the address.
I'll be there as soon as I can.
By the airport?
- Hi, Joe.
- Hey.
You wanna sit down?
I, uh, pulled a few favors to
get a flight routed through here.
They actually gave me leave.
Can you believe that?
Just to come home
and file for divorce.
I could have done it.
No...
Something's up.
I need to play this right.
Go back to the base,
raise a stink, file the papers.
Let everybody see...
I'm gonna have to
put on a show,
say some crappy things about you.
I'm sorry.
So...
Tell me what happened.
They had pictures.
They were taken four years ago.
The pictures were
four years old?
Yes.
And they finally just got around
to showing it to a review board?
There were some
harmless emails, too,
recent ones -
None that I sent.
- Harmless?
- Yes.
You must have
done somethin' else.
Were you drinkin' again?
No.
Did you piss anybody off?
Hit on the wrong girl?
No.
Maybe they were scrutinizing me
because they caught wind of you.
I wasn't with anyone
the entire four years
since those photos were taken.
I knew it was getting risky,
so I transferred to a new base,
I severed all ties,
and I have been
immaculate, pristine, since.
When you transferred,
did you sleep around
with any of the guys
on the base?
No. I thought marrying
you covered that.
Come on, that's no fail safe.
You know you've got to
feed the rumor mill.
What about Pollard?
He's not married.
You could have broken
a sweat on his back.
I did.
It didn't matter.
He was just playing me.
I'm sorry.
It might not be worth it, Joe.
It's got to be.
Call me when you
file the papers.
I will.
Be careful.
Tequila, Shel.
What?
I'd like to say it's
none of my business,
except it was taped to
the door of my business.
And I have no idea
who put it there.
I run a business
where judging people
don't make a whole lot of sense.
And?
I don't think this is right.
That girl is really screwed up
enough as it is.
OK, Shelly,
thanks for everything.
Say goodbye to the fellas for me.
Calm down.
No one's runnin' you out of town.
- That should cover my tab.
- Hey!
Mind if we talk
in your office, Shel?
Go ahead.
Somebody papered
the town last night.
I was able rip most
of them down, I think.
Got 'em in my truck.
Oh, God...
I know this is complete crap.
I was here when this
picture was taken,
and nothing was going on.
You can do anything
with photos these days,
manipulate 'em...
But who would bother?
This part is complete crap.
Of course.
This part is true.
Since when?
Since long after.
Oh, man...
That's funny.
Wish you'd told me.
I couldn't.
So the million dollar question,
of course, is...
did I ruin things for you?
No!
Just a preference then?
No.
All right, let's just
focus on who did this.
I have no idea...
But I really need
to find Saffron.
Mrs. Snow?
Saffron?
Saffron!
Put that shit out!
- Who is it?
- Pizza.
I want to talk to Saffron.
Yeah, talk? That's it?
Saffron.
Go home! I'm fine!
She don't wanna talk no more.
Get her out here
or I'll call the Sheriff.
And say what?
Whatever I need to
to get him here.
Look, I just want five minutes.
Saffron, get out here!
Tell her to go away!
I'm talkin' to her.
OK, we're marching
out of here double time.
Pull yourself together.
There's no point.
I went to the recruiter's office.
They had the pictures.
It's OK.
I can take care of it.
No, it's done!
I can fix it...
Listen, I'm not your
toy soldier anymore!
I'm not your girlfriend
and you're not my mother,
so just leave me alone.
I'm your friend.
And a soldier or sailor
you can be.
Well...
I'm a meth head now, so...
It's OK, come on.
Come on...
let's get out of here.
Hey! Where do you
think you're goin'?!
You got her high,
you son-of-a-bitch!
Stop it!
You're gonna regret
those photos, I swear to God!
You're being an idiot!
Don't you get it?!
They don't want me!
They're gonna take
a meth head instead of you?
They're gonna take
a worthless piece of shit
like me instead of you?
Saffron...
Don't you understand
I should be dead right now?
I'm the last person who should have
walked out of that car alive?!
Dude, careful where you shoot that.
You'll blow up the house.
Tie her hands.
Fuck this, man.
We're outta here.
I got this.
OK?
Bust into my house
and toss me
all around like that...
Maybe I'll make
the citizens arrest this time.
Or maybe I just shoot you in self-defense.
On the other hand,
maybe you came here
lookin' for somethin' else.
You really screwed me
in the store that day,
you know that?
Could it be you came by
just to return the favor?
Maybe you need to
prove you're straight...
Like Saff just did.
You don't need pictures...
'cause I get it all on video.
OK, maybe it's self-defense then!
Burner! No!
No!
Why'd you fuckin' do that?
Give me your cell phone.
Give me your cell phone!
I need two ambulances
and fire response at 12 Stanton.
Female, 20 years old,
gunshot wound to the abdomen.
Send HazMat, too.
There's a meth lab here.
It's not yellow.
Help is coming, help is coming.
It's OK.
Anything we can do,
just tell me.
I can offer you that lift home.
No, thanks.
Come by the station tomorrow,
if you're up to it.
OK.
It was good that you tried...
Some of these kids
are worth catching.
Yeah.
It's not your fault.
It's gonna be OK.
#
Thought you were takin' the day off.
They're a little short- handed.
What about the party?
I'll be there.
How you doin'?
Are you happy? Sad?
Are you pissed off?
No, it's good.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
It just came a little late.
Well, it's official, folks -
the "Don't Ask, Don't Tell"
policy is history
as the President just
now signed into law
a bill allowing gays to serve
openly in the military.
A lot of mixed
reaction out there,
which we will illustrate
in song after this...
- Freeze!
- Stop!
I got him!
Get off me!
Anything in your pockets
gonna stick me?
- Hi, Dale.
- You're a cop?!
Yeah, if I can't fight the War on Terror,
there's always the War on Drugs!
I'm arresting you for
manufacturing crystal meth.
Oh, and I'm also
giving you a citation
for a cracked sideview mirror.
Nice pictures, by the way.
Nice uniform.
Same to you.
Sorry I was late.
I got a good story
to tell you about my morning.
- I got some stories for you, too.
- I'll bet you do.
All available units...
Duty calls.
I gotta march off
that train ride anyway.
Outstanding, Marine.
I'll see you at your
welcome home party tonight.
- Don't be late.
- M'am, yes, m'am.
Mama, mama, can't you see...
What the corps has done to me...
United States Marine Corps!
