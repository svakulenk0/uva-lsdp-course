During the long, dark period
of the Great Wars,
an elite class of soldier
rose from battle.
Their unbreakable code
was simple...
Possess a noble heart
of courage,
From out of those years
of bloodshed,
Its power would assimilate
persons of every color,
eroded the traditions
of the great knights,
Lay down your swords,
you may walk free.
I'm the official envoy
of the Emperor.
-I carry a message
for Lord Bartok.
-I welcome you to the castle.
I will take the message.
The message is for you master.
Anyone who wishes
to speak with my master
must first speak with me.
Do you believe that the words
of the Emperor
are fit for a mere retainer?
I have no doubt
that your arrogance
is effective in other houses.
Therefore, it is a mistake
I am willing to forgive.
What is your name,
foot soldier? Mm?
I'm certain that the Emperor
himself would want to know
who has been so charitable
toward his envoy.
An introduction
would have been
the right place
for you to start.
I am Commander Raiden
of the Seventh Rank.
Your name
is well known to me.
Forgive my presumption.
My Lord.
This comes directly
from the capital?
Sealed before my eyes
by the Emperor himself.
Very well.
I am ordered
to the capital
to meet
with Minister Gezza Mott
to review new protocols
and duties.
This is a farce!
The new protocol
is the bribe expected of me
at that meeting,
and for no other reason
than to remain
in his good favor.
This minister's influence
has grown considerably
since your last term.
He is favored to succeed
as First Council.
I will not tolerate
this kind of bribery,
either in my own pocket
or in my capital.
- What are your thoughts?
- I follow you, My Lord.
Since when do you speak
anything but truth?
Say what you think.
Well, if it's truly
the injustice of corruption
which upsets you,
then perhaps you might
have been so passionately moved
to act before you arrived
in your own court.
What exactly do you mean
by that?
I mean that it would be
prudent to examine
if this is simply
a matter of pride.
It's not a matter of pride,
it's a question of dignity.
- So you will refuse the duty.
- I refuse the extortion!
My Lord, corruption within
the capital is nothing new.
How is this different
from any other absurd new tax?
When a man like that
can demand a bribe
out in the open,
with no fear of recourse,
we're headed
for a dangerous time.
What?
You think
I hold on to an idealism
that no longer exists?
Perhaps.
- Sir?
- I'm fine.
- Let me call the physician.
- He's examined me.
When? What did he say?
You will not speak of this
to them.
Ah, my beautiful ones return.
And how did your studies
go today?
Lilly's music instructor
has said
that she's
the most advanced student.
- Of course she is.
- I think he's exaggerating.
And I think he's
an astute judge of talent.
Either that or he's prepared
to request a raise in his wages.
Now, will you play something
for me?
Good.
Not all confrontations
will be one-on-one
as now practice sessions.
I was not aware
we were practicing
such a scenario.
There are never warnings
in battle.
Not all adversaries
will adhere
to the warrior's code
as we do.
You must always be on alert.
We must begin preparations
to leave immediately.
We've been summoned
to the capital.
Lieutenant, will I be
joining the convoy?
That is
the Commander's decision.
With all respect, sir,
I believe I'm ready.
If the Commander made
decisions based on what others
believed about themselves,
half these men
would have my position.
Gather the men
to prepare for our journey!
You startled me.
How long have you
been standing there?
Hours.
Your humor is not on par
with your stealth.
It is an unfair advantage
to use your skills
upon your wife.
Trust me, it is you
who has the advantage over me.
And what might that be?
I heard the official messengers
had arrived.
I take it they didn't
carry good news.
Why do you say that?
You may be able
to hide your presence from me,
but not your thoughts.
We are summoned
to the capital.
I thought you were not expected
until the turn of the season.
-It is a request
from our new minister.
-For what purpose?
Nothing worth disturbing
our evening for.
You mean you do not wish
to discuss it.
No, I mean I will soon
be apart from you
and I can think
of many better things
to occupy our time with.
Hmm.
It's difficult to argue
with that logic.
Come with me.
My great-grandfather,
a ferocious warrior.
Not well-liked,
but he was responsible
for expanding our lands
into the province
it is today.
My father...
He alone was responsible
for protecting these lands
during the Great War.
You would've taken pleasure
in knowing him.
My son.
I have no heir.
I will be the tenth
and last generation
buried here.
and against all counsel,
it was idealism that led me
to invite you into my home.
A young man
with an empty soul,
muddied by drink,
and as dark as the graves
of those who crossed his path.
But it was idealism
that saw through all of that
to the man I see before me.
Now you give me better advice
than I give myself.
When I have departed
this world,
these lands
will be in your care.
-My Lord.
-My name will be yours
to uphold.
But your sword is
to be passed to an heir.
I am merely your retainer.
You are the heir
to my spirit.
Our bond has been earned,
not inherited.
- No, sir...
- Take the sword.
- You be safe.
- Of course.
Be well, my love.
- You ready, Commander?
- Yes, My Lord.
We have the gift
for Minister Gezza Mott?
Yes,
it's all taken care of.
Shhh.
- Gabriel.
- Commander.
Thank you
for this great honor.
I knew your mother
and father well.
If they were still among us,
they would be very proud.
- So it begins again.
- So it does.
Sit down. Sit down.
Sir,
may I ask you a question?
Of course.
You've known the Commander
a long time, yes?
Since I was your age.
Is it true he was not born
into the military class?
He comes from peasant stock.
Orphaned as a young boy,
entire family died of the fever.
Is that when Lord Bartok
took him in?
No. Much later,
when he was a young man.
- Why do you ask?
- Stories circulate about him.
They say he was cruel
and murderous
For many years,
he was given to the drink.
The dark fog made him violent.
Does knowing this
change your respect for him?
One is to be admired
for rebuilding thyself,
not judged.
Now get some rest.
Long journey ahead tomorrow.
Welcome, Lord Bartok.
- Your journey went well?
- Quite.
It can be long.
It seemed short.
I see you've come
bearing a gift.
It's customary
for an official visit.
- A robe.
- A fine robe.
You may also keep the box.
Did your retainer
attend to the gift?
No, I chose it personally.
Very well.
We'll begin early tomorrow.
There is obviously much to do.
I look forward to your review
of the new protocols.
Yes, and in addition to that,
we'll get the chance
to discuss the challenges
which face the future
of the Bartok lands.
I don't think
he liked the color.
If I'd known
what you'd intended,
I would've insisted
you bring something more.
More?
I gave him the box too.
This is not a matter
of amusement.
He has taken this
as a personal insult.
-Tomorrow I will bring
a more suitable gift.
-You will not.
And in my presence,
you will refer
to the Minister's demand
as it really is... a bribe.
Adopting the language
of the pretense
only serves to ease
participation in it.
My Lord, I think that
perhaps now is not the time
to take such a hard stand.
And if I ease my approach now,
at what crossing
would you recommend
I stand my ground?
When they've
taken half my land?
When it comes to a point
where I have to
exercise my own tyranny
over those beneath me
to support the bribes
of those above?
Who does he think he is?
Perhaps he did not understand
what is expected of him.
He understands perfectly.
Does he arrive here
planning to make a name
for himself at my expense?
Or is he so filled up
with pride
that he has no room
for humility?
Here, dog,
a silk for your filth!
Where are we expected?
There is something
I wish to show you.
Such a fine sword.
May I?
This is a nobleman's blade.
Where did you come by it?
It was a gift...
from my master.
I have never heard
of such generosity
from lord to retainer.
It seems you have won.
It is my favorite room here
because it exemplifies
the great virtues
of generosity and humility...
Qualities necessary
to operate smoothly
within the workings
of the capital.
A quality
all the other noblemen
whom I have received
seem to grasp.
Are you beginning to understand
the points of our talk?
Yes.
Very impressive.
You really intend giving
all this away?
I'm reaching the end
of my patience with you.
We can play this game
as long as you like,
but you'll receive
no bribe from me.
Is that what this is to you?
A game?
How do you think the Emperor
would respond
to his command
being thought of as a game?
Since you're only threat
seems to be running
to the Emperor
like a pouting child,
you should ask him
- as soon as possible.
- I need not ask.
You were ordered
to this review by the Emperor,
and yet you reject his word.
I reject any attempt by you
to exert some delusional power
over me.
It is you who live
under illusion, not me.
I offer you no threat
but a promise.
I will not only take
your property and standing,
but I will turn everything
connected to the Bartok name
into dust.
And when I'm done,
it will be as if neither you
nor any generation before
had ever existed.
You should be careful
not to overstep.
Something wrong?
I have known many like you,
men who,
once their hairs bleed grey
and their spines cut them
like daggers,
come to revise
their own history.
Truth is that
your innermost fear
is in fact
your most striking attribute.
You are irrelevant.
You have neither cast a shadow
nor left any footprints
upon the great legacy
of the Bartok clan.
Your only achievement
was being born into nobility...
and you somehow failed
to reproduce even that.
Guards! Guards!
You draw your blade
on a minister of the Emperor?
Minister,
your father-in-law approaches.
What happened?
All I've been told
is that you were attacked.
I cannot say too much
at this time.
But we are about to witness
the wrath of the Emperor.
You have been summoned
before our most glorious
and wise Emperor.
The prisoner who stands
before you is Lord Bartok.
He has committed
the crime
of attacking a loyal minister
of the Emperor.
The prisoner will now
be permitted to address
his peers
before our master
passes judgment.
What has just been said of me
is true.
I offer no argument
nor dispute
the simple facts.
But they hardly begin to cover
the scope of my true crimes.
Honor requires
more than admission,
so I offer a full confession
and the whole truth.
For far too long,
I failed to recognize
my own hypocrisy.
I ignored
my own cowardice,
conveniently hiding
behind a position
of political compromise.
And for what?
To retain the meager wealth
and rank that men desire.
So I come before you
a condemned man
for having finally stood up
to injustice.
My shame and regret
is that I failed to do so
before it arrived
in my own court.
We supply the armies,
we build the roads,
we employ the nation.
Still, we remain silent
while our coffers are emptied
and our freedoms eroded.
There will be times
where we are powerless
to injustice,
but there must never
be a time
when we fail to protest.
This man, Gezza Mott,
is a cancer, growing.
And the only proper thing
to do is to cut it out.
You all know what I speak of.
Each one of you
has been subjected
to his extortion.
But my words are not in judgment
of my fellow noblemen,
they are a warning.
I urge you to consider
what you are doing,
for we are helping this man
to forge the very chains
that bind us.
Which brings me
to the confession
of my true crime,
so that I may redeem
my honor.
My crime
is only that I failed
to kill Gezza Mott
when I had the chance.
We have enjoyed
hundreds of years of peace
under my family's rule.
We brought order
where there was chaos,
peace where there was nothing
but war and bloodshed.
My subjects accept their roles,
content in the knowledge
they serve the greater good.
If you think your words
will move your fellow noblemen
to dissent,
then you're sorely misled.
Are you prepared
to receive my judgment
and regain your honor?
I am prepared
to receive your judgment,
but my honor is intact.
You dare to contradict
the word of the Emperor?
All those in your house
shall be evicted
from your lands.
The Bartok clan is no more.
And your delusions of self
require more extreme measures.
Your crime and defiance
to the ordinances
of the capital
shall be repaid with
nothing less than your head.
-You cannot do this!
-How dare you address
the Emperor directly!
My Lord, a judgment of this kind
is unprecedented for a nobleman.
This display of arrogance
cannot go unanswered.
What do you suggest?
Your Commander
is fiercely loyal to you,
Lord Bartok.
And so it is fitting
that you should meet your end
by his sword.
Should you refuse the order,
all of Lord Bartok's
blood relations shall be
executed as well.
- Minister!
- First Council,
the word of the Emperor
has been spoken.
Commander!
Let him pass.
- You will do this.
- No.
-I'm already dead.
-I will take death
at your side
rather than participate
in this spectacle.
I know you will,
but how will that serve us?
My Lord...
- I cannot do this.
- It's already done.
Think only of what follows.
The spirit of our clan
will endure through you.
Commander Raiden!
The Emperor's word
is not a request that
requires your decision.
Remember this, Raiden,
the wounds of honor
are self-inflicted.
- Draw your sword.
- My Lord, please.
Commander, draw your sword.
Your devotion to the code
is absolute, is it not?
-Yes, My Lord.
-Then, as your lord
and master,
I order you
to complete this duty.
From this moment on,
be no more grieved
about what you have done.
This will quiet
any whispers of dissent
for quite some time.
We must deal
with Commander Raiden
with a quick and firm hand.
Do you offer this
for our master's benefit
or your own?
Did you see
how he stood before you?
He's a rabid dog, that one.
We control the warriors
through their absolute loyalty
to their masters.
How do you think two million
of them would react
if we eliminated
one of their own
for exemplifying
the virtue of loyalty?
What if he should
seek vengeance?
He is not to be touched.
There are already
too many disavowed
looking for a reason to act.
If you come upon real proof
that he intends to move
against you,
then I will order his death.
But not until then.
- Is that understood?
- Yes, Master. Until then.
Shall I see to the eviction
and the subsequent dispensing
of the Bartok lands?
The lands should be
divided equally
so as not to favor
one nobleman over another.
Of course.
But I will not
bother our master
with the details
at this time.
I will
attend to it myself.
I'm certain you will.
You must keep aware
of the Minister, My Lord.
I know you do not approve
of Gezza Mott,
but his ambition and greed
serve my interests well.
Yes, My Lord.
Hannah.
Father.
Auguste! I hear your crops
were plentiful this season.
Yes, they were.
So the lands I took
and gave over to you
proved sufficient
in replacing the dying ones
you had when we first met?
They have.
Perfect.
Now tell me,
you knew Lord Bartok.
What do you know
of his retainer?
I did not know Bartok
that well,
though we had
a few dealings.
As to this Raiden,
I only know of him
through rumor.
Tales of his violent past.
You spent time with him.
What is your assessment?
I would be shocked
if he were to let this go.
I ask that you send me
a thousand of your men
to increase my security
until this is over with.
- A thousand?
- Yes.
That is more than half
my retainer.
All of whom you have
because of me.
Would you prefer to return
to the impoverished state
you were in
before I graciously
took your daughter as my wife?
No, Minister.
You will oversee
the eviction.
After that,
and for as long as it takes,
I want eyes upon Raiden
every minute of the day.
When he decides to strike,
we will be ready.
Sir!
Are we going
to let this happen?
- We won't leave without a fight!
- Yeah!
Everyone must pack
their things and leave.
Palace guard
is already on its way.
We're simply to be thrown
out into the street
with nothing?
How are we supposed
to support ourselves?
Commander,
are we to understand
that you would
have us do nothing?
Our master is dead.
I'm no longer your commander.
From now on,
you owe allegiance
to no one but yourselves.
Gentlemen,
you are disavowed.
Don't touch her!
These people
are losing their home.
You will treat them
with respect.
Where are you going?
- I'll have a drink here!
- Round for my friends.
That's all of it?
Well, it's barely enough
to meet our expenses.
Tonight we'll treat ourselves
to a good meal in the city.
It will do you good.
All right.
Well, I'll be on my way.
The roads into the market
will already be busy.
Did you see?
Your father gave me
my own brand.
That's wonderful.
He's never taken
to an apprentice so quickly.
And I hope soon
to stop saying "apprentice"
and start saying son.
Now add your mark.
We have to be going.
Once they have done
installing the panels,
we will continue
with the floors.
Yes, sir.
Cannot find a dagger
like this anywhere
in the land.
- Token of my deep respect.
- Support such as yours
is how our nation
grows in strength.
You can be certain your request
for tax relief will be heard.
Thank you, Minister.
- Are you almost done?
- Yes.
Perhaps my body
would have the strength
to rid itself of this memento
if I had a physician
of real skill.
I have followed
the proper treatment.
Something seems to prevent
the wound from closing.
Is that what you offer
as an explanation?
"Something"?
Get out!
Why did you send
a servant away?
You do not allow
for interruptions
when in conference.
Did you consider
that the servant is required
to taste everything
she brings me for the threat
of poisoning?
No?
Or perhaps you were fully aware
and you feigned ignorance.
- Of course not.
- And I'm expected
to take your word
simply because you're my wife?
The tea's getting cold.
It appears the tea
is not poisoned.
How is the gate coming along?
This iron gate is capable
of holding back
an entire army.
Perhaps,
once it is installed,
we could release
some of the extra guards
on loan
from your father-in-law.
Providing for them
has brought us outside
the parameters of our budget.
The cost
will not be an issue.
The cost of the pavilion
now stands at five times
the approved estimate.
Without the gold leaf...
As stimulating as your accounts
of my accounting are,
I need a word in private
with my commander.
- What news have you for me?
- More of the same.
- And his men?
- Scattered about.
Finding employment
where they can.
-Has he had any contact
with them?
-No.
And yet he still remains
in the capital.
We have eyes upon him
every moment of the day
and night.
He's patient.
But his act doesn't fool me.
Nor should it you.
Prod him.
Find out what he's hiding.
Please follow me.
Look who is here.
- Lieutenant.
- Please sit, everyone.
- Bring us some more to drink.
- Gabriel.
So, what do you say
about my establishment?
-Certainly
it is a good fit for you.
-A perfect fit.
And you, how are you
keeping yourselves?
I'm managing the fishing boats
of a wealthy merchant.
Gabriel is working
for them also.
That would explain
your distinctive fragrance.
And the reason my wife
allows me to remain here alone.
No other woman will touch me.
Perhaps without compensation.
- Half price for you.
- No, thank you.
I will accept that offer.
Once you begin paying
for your drinks,
I will consider extending
my discounts to others.
Gentlemen,
to your prosperity.
-That way you will
further increase mine.
-Hear, hear.
Cheers.
- And you, Jim?
- I work when I can.
Maybe there's some work
at the harbor.
- Should I inquire?
- No.
Such...
Such a labor's not for me.
Between your poverty
and his smell,
I must be sitting with
the two loneliest men
in the capital.
Indeed, we're
the two loneliest men.
He spends
most of his days here now.
Though you told me
he had fallen back
to his old ways,
I find it hard to believe.
He appears to be better
than usual tonight.
-I must be going.
-Please, do not leave
on account of him.
It sickens me to be
in his presence.
Lieutenant. Lieutenant!
Where you going?
Come and have a drink
with me.
I'm no longer your lieutenant.
Raiden, wake up.
Here, drink this.
Let us get you home.
I'm fine.
-Let me help.
You can barely walk.
-I don't need your help.
I'm fine.
You will not find anyone
better than me
to teach your son
how to wield a sword.
I gave you my offer.
And I don't see anyone else
here bidding on your talents.
So do you accept my offer?
'Cause I have no more time
to waste.
Yeah, good luck with your son.
He's gonna need it.
And then I saw him coming
out of Gezza Mott's front gates.
How? He would have
never been allowed
within the Minister's walls.
He's working
as a metal worker's apprentice
and has an entirely
new identity.
I questioned others
in the square about him.
He must've been
in desperate need of work.
I'm certain that
the Minister would pay
handsomely to know
that one of Bartok's men
has created a false identity
in order to work
right under his nose.
Shall we?
The first thing I'll do
with my newfound fortune
is obtain lodging closer
to drinking establishments.
- I like the sound of that.
- And then I'll earn my...
You're late.
Jim saw you leaving
Gezza Mott's today.
He was gonna bring
that information to Gezza Mott
with hopes of a reward.
I was left
with no other choice.
- It is my fault.
- Not your fault.
Jim was willing to sacrifice
your life for his own rewards.
That's it, we cannot
have any more mistakes.
Do you have the credentials?
Gezza Mott's compound
is now the most fortified
complex in the nation.
Gaining entry is not only
going to be difficult,
it is probably impossible.
The only point
of direct access is here,
at the main gates.
The drawbridge is raised
at sundown,
when the day workers
must exit.
It
We have to
take control of it
from the outside, here,
and the inside, here.
Past the main gates,
soldiers' barracks.
every night,
fully armed
and ready to fight.
We won't be able to
fend them off if we wake them.
Once past
the soldiers' barracks,
we must enter
the garden maze.
It's the only way to traverse
the compound unseen.
Not only do I have to
prune every tree,
but since the Minister's
chambers are set so high,
I have ensure the gardens
look good from above.
It is the only point
of cover before the castle.
If we are able to survive
the torrent of arrows
raining down upon us,
we'll finally reach
the iron gates of the residence.
Absolutely impossible
to open from the outside.
- Sir, I must be going.
- Yes, of course.
- Where you going?
- To see his girl.
Why are we spending time
on this
when we could be hearing
the young one's tales
of innocence lost?
Leave the boy be.
Mind yourself.
Here are the forged
documents necessary
for working inside the compound.
I must do some repairs
to the roof of your watchtower.
The previous carpenter
did not do very good work.
With the wages they pay us,
who could blame him?
I sold three baskets today.
Something wrong?
I'm tired of eating nothing
but rice.
If I was not
the only one working,
perhaps we could afford
something else.
Why are you still doing this?
There's no shame
in feeling grief,
but destroying yourself
-will not bring
Lord Bartok back.
-Spare me your insight.
That is all we have left.
Why not stay in with me?
Just one night!
And watch you
weave more baskets?
Please, Raiden!
Please.
I cannot do this
for much longer.
Where is it?
- Where is it?
- What?
Your sword.
Oh.
Here it is.
I'm leaving.
I agree.
This is not
the type of establishment
for a respectable woman.
I'm leaving you.
I have struggled
with the hope that
you'd come back to me,
return to being the man
I married.
But that you'd sell your sword
only proves you never will.
If you have something
to say to me to make me
think otherwise,
now is the time.
Sir, the Minister
has been summoned.
His wisdom and loyalty
will forever be remembered.
Come with me.
Before his passing,
First Council recommended
I pay attention to
your dealings with the noblemen.
He believed your methods
are exceeding political
and moral propriety.
There is a balance
to be maintained
between dominance
and patronage.
Your initial gesture
as First Council
will be a new tax relief
for both the citizens
and the noblemen.
It is the great honor
of my life to serve you
in this capacity.
Your appointment
also brings to an end
any and all bribes demanded
of the noblemen.
In your capacity
as Minister,
there was sufficient distance
between us
that I could allow you
such freedom.
But no more.
It is not needed.
And this obsession
of yours with Raiden
will cease immediately.
You surround yourself
with more security than I.
It's an embarrassment to you.
He has already
destroyed himself.
Accept that you've emerged
the stronger with some dignity.
Yes, Master.
I thank you
for your guidance and wisdom.
Does he not understand
that I'm under siege?
My Lord, I believe Raiden
is no longer a threat to you.
- Why?
- He has sold his sword.
And?
A warrior disposing
of his sword
can only be interpreted
in one way.
He has abandoned all attachment
to his former self.
You think to pacify me
with this?
Who cares
about a piece of metal?
Do you think you can
obscure your failure
to expose him
by using this juvenile
warrior's code as justification?
Leave me.
I will decide
what need be done.
Show yourself.
Show yourself!
Show yourself!
My husband requests you.
These unfolding paths
have been quite interesting,
when you consider them.
As I ascend to the apex
of my ambitions,
he sinks further
into the abyss.
In recognizing that symmetry,
if you were him,
could you allow
such a personal disgrace
and affront to go unanswered?
No.
So I've come to realize
that we're dealing
with someone of such
profound internal damage
that he has simply
not been pushed far enough.
Find me Lord Bartok's family.
Do you take issue
with anything asked of you?
Not at all.
And for this price,
there's not much
I would take issue with.
Commander.
I have a surprise
for you tonight.
A new selection.
And listen,
no negotiating on this one.
She's still a virgin.
Raiden.
Raiden.
You have come for me.
What is wrong?
You have come to take me,
have you not?
Raiden.
Please! Please!
Please! No! No!
Raiden! Raiden!
Raiden!
Raiden, help me!
No!
No!
Don't leave me.
It is over.
Are you sure?
Perhaps he simply
didn't care for the girl.
Are you listening to me?
His master's daughter
was presented to him as a whore,
and he did nothing.
Not honor, not his family,
not himself,
and certainly not you.
At last,
I'm free of this.
Well done! Well done!
I've marked where the urns
are buried.
You did well.
We have planned,
we have sacrificed,
we have waited
for the right moment.
And now...
it is time.
Auguste, welcome.
I see you come bearing
quite the gift.
I wanted to give you
something special
to recognize
your well-earned appointment
and to thank you
for returning my men.
Of all the gifts
I have received,
this is my favorite.
I'll have a short visit
with my daughter
before my journey home
with my guards.
Yes, yes,
that will be fine.
Honor is something
that all men are born with.
It cannot be taken from you,
nor can it be granted.
It must only not be lost.
We now stand at the door
of our final great act.
Tonight, our enemy
will bear witness
to the unbreakable code
of the Seventh Rank.
We will reclaim
what they tried to take.
We will restore the name
of our master...
- the voice of our people...
and the spirit
of our nation.
Guard! Guard!
Hold them
as long as you can.
- It is him!
- Stay in your chambers.
Why did I ever trust you?
I told you, you imbecile!
Remain in your chambers!
Open the flaps!
Ready the archers!
Lord Bartok was my oldest
and dearest friend.
I knew you would not allow
this disgrace
- to go unavenged.
- My master told me that
should I be left
without anyone to trust,
that I could always trust you.
I offer my help
in any manner you need.
But with a condition...
You ensure
my daughter's freedom
- I give you my word.
- Tell me what you need.
Find somewhere safe to hide.
Wait.
Thank you.
Let's go!
Did I do well?
You fought well.
You fought well.
We have come for Gezza Mott.
I can no more back down
than you.
You think you're a hero?
You will be remembered only
as a traitor and a disgrace.
Only time will tell
how we are remembered.
Something you...
no longer have.
Who is it? We're closed.
Your father's honor
has been reclaimed.
The Bartok name
will never be forgotten.
Thank you.
To wage an attack
on the First Council,
the flagrant disregard
of my power...
It will not go unanswered.
The only question is,
how severe the punishment,
how many generations
of each should I wipe out.
The only reason
you are all here
is because I am without
a First Council.
Now will someone
speak their mind?
My Lord, it would be prudent
to recognize
that to the people,
these men are heroes.
- Heroes?
these men stand for the virtues
that made our nation great.
Virtues once exemplified
by all warriors.
Now hardly to be found
in any.
If your punishment
is seen to be unjust...
you chance
turning these warriors
into martyrs
for a cause against you.
However, if we treat them
with the respect
befitting
an honorable warrior,
we align these heroes
with us.
I cannot allow
such transgression
to go unpunished.
Everyone must be reminded
that no one can stand
against the Emperor.
My Emperor...
may I offer a solution?
If we are to succeed,
the Emperor's first instinct
will be to take
the heads of each of my men
and their families.
-You are correct.
-But, as with all
his decisions,
he will first seek advice.
Without a First Council
at his side,
-he will be open
to the voices of others.
-You mean to say mine.
My men accept that death
will be waiting for them
They are warriors
of the Seventh Rank.
They will not ask
for a reprieve.
But I ask it for them.
And not yourself?
These warriors
are nameless to most.
One is known to all.
Commander.
-What is this?
-You are to assume command
at the castle.
No.
Commander.
Commander,
you cannot do this.
We stand with you.
I stand with you.
Lieutenant, your devotion
to the code is absolute,
is it not?
Yes.
Then as your commander,
I order you
to take control
of the Bartok clan.
It is with benevolent wisdom
and esteem
that the Emperor proclaims
these noble warriors
as heroes of the people.
They are a shining example
and a reminder
of those values
that bind us
However, no matter
what the circumstance,
an attack on a member
of the Emperor's council
is by law
considered an attack
on the Emperor himself
I'm sorry.
I am so sorry for all
you've had to endure.
Acting the part
was not difficult.
Wondering if
I was truly losing you
was unbearable.
