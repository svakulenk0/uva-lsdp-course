Five months in Brazil.
You're a hard man to find.
You even have the accent right.
I do say so.
The principal I represent
has an offer for you.
He would like three men killed.
Each death must look like an accident.
Your specialty, I believe.
Seems that reports of your demise
have been greatly exaggerated.
My principal could make that known
to certain... interested parties.
Which means that your new life here
would end rather quickly.
Or you can do the job
and go back to being dead.
What's your pleasure,
senhor Otto Santos?
Let me make a call.
What are you doing?
Tell your principal it never pays
to fuck with the dead.
Get the fuck on the ground!
Get the fuck down!
Don't look at me!
- Bishop.
- Hello, Mei.
You're different.
Older.
Something more than that.
I need time to find someone
before they find me.
Then I'll be moving on.
Who else is here?
No one. Diving season's over.
Come.
Your home's waiting for you.
How was your trip?
It was okay.
It was a busy season.
But don't worry,
no one came near your home.
Nothing's changed.
Get some rest.
Hi. How can I help you?
Great, you speak English.
I'm running low on first aid.
I'm staying on the boat.
Sure.
This is all I have.
Thanks.
If I don't have what you need,
i can call our supply boat.
They can take you back
to Phuket to get it.
No, this is great.
Thanks so much.
Anytime.
- ...don't fucking tease me!
- Frank-- help!
- Help!
- Bishop!
Bishop!
They're fighting. It's bad.
You want a piece of me?!
Stay down.
I've met her.
She has a backbone.
Women like that
get killed in these situations.
Domestic squabble, Mei.
Not my business.
You helped me once.
Help her.
Or I will do it.
Hold this.
Frank, get the fuck away from me!
Frank!
Not worth it.
Bitch!
Let her go.
Who the fuck are you?
Please, help me.
I said, let her go. Last chance.
Let go of me, frank.
You don't want to do that.
Fuck you!
Is he dead?
Bishop.
Shit.
Take her ashore.
I'll deal with the boat.
Okay.
- Bishop.
- Where is she?
Sleeping. In your bungalow.
What's going on?
Gina Thornton. American.
- That's you, right?
- Yeah.
You're the second woman
who has my picture in her phone.
The first was working
for a guy called crain.
Name ring a bell?
The only thing
you got right was my name.
The first woman was a messenger.
Is that what you are?
So what's the message?
I already told you--
tell me about crain.
What are you supposed to do for him?
Where is he?
Fine. I'll talk.
Look... I don't work for crain.
That's the truth.
But he did send me.
Where is he?
- I don't know.
- Why are you here?
He has something on me.
I had no choice.
Right.
Any of his men nearby?
He didn't say, I didn't ask.
What about frank?
Part of the setup.
Explain.
He was supposed to get mean,
i escape to this island.
It wasn't meant to be real.
But then frank got drunk
and attacked me.
Crain wanted me to look like a victim.
And get next to me?
Yeah.
But frank took his part too far.
So we meet. What next?
I use the cell and call
the pre-programmed number.
Let it ring once.
After that, I don't know.
My new girl gets kidnapped is what.
What?
The thought didn't cross your mind?
Okay, so you fall for me,
and crain thinks he has leverage on you.
Why?
Well, to force me to do something
i don't want to do.
What is it that you do?
I'll make the call, not you.
I choose when they come.
Then I'll take crain out.
No. I'm not going to help you kill anyone.
Do you really believe that crain
lets the people he blackmails
into helping him, live?
I've spent my whole life
setting people up to die.
I can set you up to live.
My father was a doctor
of eastern medicine.
He was a healer.
Bishop used to study with him.
To learn how to heal?
A man like him?
I thought so, too.
But my father understood
that those who have been hurt the most
often have the greatest ability to heal.
special military operative, Gina Thornton,
left the war zone in Afghanistan
to offer humanitarian
assistance in Cambodia.
After my last deployment,
i just needed
Too many innocent people
getting caught in the line of fire.
Rules of engagement
made it impossible to prevent.
And then, you know,
when I came to phnom penn, I, uh,
And, um, I felt like I can maybe
do something good with my life.
I can't afford any surprises.
I run a shelter for victims
of human trafficking in Cambodia.
There's always been an issue or two,
but I've managed to handle it.
A few weeks ago...
One of my staff members was kidnapped.
Two days later, she was thrown off a truck
at my front door.
Beaten. Died within an hour.
Crain sent this asshole, Jeremy,
who said it was just a taste
of what he'd do
to everyone at the shelter.
Including the children.
They are my weakness.
All the leverage crain needed.
So, you see, I didn't have a choice.
I had to do what crain wanted me to.
- What are you doing?
- Hold my hand.
It's for
They're watching.
Where?
Two men in the zodiac.
Out in the ocean.
There you are.
Come on, you two.
You're gonna miss the best part.
Give me your hands.
Hold this, please.
- We can just get a drink and...
- No, you will not.
- You will stay right there.
- Mei...
- Thank you very much.
- What are you doing?
All couples have to be tied together.
But we're not a couple.
You sure looked like it on the beach.
So... do you go to weddings... a lot?
Not my idea of a good time.
Me neither.
Here.
We supposed to drink this?
No. Put your fingertips in it
and place three dots
on each other's foreheads for good luck.
- Enjoy.
- I could use some good luck.
"Enjoy"?
Okay, my turn.
Come on, let's just get a drink.
Leave that.
All right. One second.
This is a great look for you.
You missed a spot.
It's really kind of stuck.
Okay, okay.
Next time, use your shoe.
I love this song.
- This a thai song?
- Yeah.
It's so good.
Wanna dance?
No, don't worry.
I don't-- I don't want to dance with you.
What, you think I'm a bad dancer?
- You look like you're a terrible dancer.
- Fine.
Hey.
I... I just wanted to thank you
for everything.
Everything?
And I wanted to apologize for...
Getting you into this mess.
Those kids are everything to me.
If they get trafficked or...
Or killed...
I couldn't bear it.
I understand.
I was an orphan, too.
I was sold to an east end gangster
who specialized
in training child soldiers.
What happened?
I escaped, he didn't.
No doubt they blamed him.
Took it out in blood.
So now he blames you.
Yeah, this is his payback.
Oh, god. I'm so sorry.
It's not your fault.
What are we gonna do?
I worked it out.
Supply boat from the back side
of the island, out of view.
By tomorrow night,
you'll be out of danger.
Your kids, too.
It's all arranged.
I'm not doing his three kills.
Once you're safe,
there's only going to be one. Him.
But they'll never let you near him.
They'll never know I was there.
I want you to hold on
to something for me.
Until I come back.
My father gave this to me.
It's the only memory I have of him.
I'll keep it safe.
That's
Look at me.
Remember, I'll make sure
to get you home.
Trust me.
Bishop!
Bishop!
Help!
Bishop!
Bishop!
Mr. crain, I have him right here.
Tell me how to find you face-to-face.
Are we done?
Follow me.
Sit down.
Please, don't move.
I'd listen to her
if I were you, Arthur.
No need for guards or guns
when the man you want's
sitting on a pound of semtex.
How did you find me, riah?
What, no, "hello.
Nice to see you after all these years"?
But then, you always were one
for getting down to business.
How did I find you?
You should know better
than anyone, Arthur,
there's no privacy anymore.
Not with wonderful things like
facial recognition
and satellite tracking.
I'm going to give you something
i never give anyone;
chance to walk away.
Chance to walk away.
Chance to walk away.
Give me the girl and walk away.
I see you've developed
a sense of humor over the years.
But if it's all the same: No.
I need you. You're the best.
Open it.
I need you to eliminate three people.
And this is the first.
His name is krill.
Mass-murderer and warlord.
He's also the highest-profile
arms dealer in Africa.
He's imprisoned
on penjara kaedah in Malaysia.
His imprisonment
is what keeps him secure.
It's impossible for his enemies
to get to him.
And this?
It's important that you
swallow it only after the kill,
or the fuel cell will degrade
and we'll never find you.
Where's Gina?
Do the three kills, Arthur.
Get the girl back.
Even if you don't love her,
you at least owe her, no?
I mean, she's in this shit
because of you.
How do I know you'll keep her alive?
Finish your kill, get a video call.
After the last one, you'll receive
instructions where to find her.
And your word's good, is it?
Good heavens, absolutely not.
But I do have a very keen
sense of self-preservation.
I know that cheating you
will only make me your target.
And since that concludes
our business for the moment,
I wish you  chance.
Let's get moving, sweetheart, come on.
Come on, let's go.
set atop cliffs
more than 100 meters high
So, basically impossible to get in,
and nobody has ever gotten out.
He's surrounded at all times
by his team of loyal soldiers.
Getting him alone
will be your main challenge.
Shark repellent. Yes, sir.
Thank you.
It's powerful stuff.
Hope you know what you're doing.
- Hey!
Hey, hey, hey, you!
What? What?
What do you want, huh?
- Hey, stop.
- Yeah, right.
- Stop.
- Fuck you.
Martin basman,
you are under arrest.
Thank you.
Bishop, remember,
it has to look like an accident.
If he dies with a knife in his back,
no one will be there to pick you up.
- Who the hell is that?
- Krill.
He was an executioner for people like
Charles Taylor and the sudanese militia.
He was an executioner for people like
Charles Taylor and the sudanese militia.
He was an executioner for people like
Charles Taylor and the sudanese militia.
People say he ate
the hearts of his victims.
Some have relatives who want revenge.
Like that guy over there.
He used to be krill's best assassin.
Now all he wants to do is kill him.
But he has his bodyguards
constantly protecting him.
You are a good man.
Why don't you join us for dinner?
I'm not sure I like the company.
Then they are not invited.
Hey. Come, come.
Come in, my friend.
There are six murders
and  stabbings every week
in this shithole.
Most of them pointed at me.
That guy you stopped,
he used to work for me.
Maybe he is still upset
that I killed his brother.
Loyalty is a scarce commodity
in my line of business.
Oh, yes.
How did you know
that he would want to kill me?
I hear things.
My juju tells me everything
that I need to hear.
Maybe you weren't listening hard enough.
Do you know who I am?
Krill.
You run this place.
Exactly.
And when I get out of this place,
I'm going to run all of Africa.
There could be a job
for a man like you.
I already have a job.
- What job?
- You.
Let the man pray.
Here he comes.
He's right below us.
Bring up the net.
Nothing in the net, sir.
What the fuck?
Looking for someone?
I want my call.
Well, bishop survived.
Happy now?
Prison food'll kill you.
Put Gina on.
How are you holding up?
Crain wanted me to let you know that
you have 36 hours
to eliminate the next target,
or they will eliminate me.
That won't happen.
This is your next kill.
Adrian cook.
Did bishop tell you where he got this?
It belonged to his father.
I never saw him take it off. Never.
You know, I wasn't sure
there was anything
in the world that could break Arthur,
until I saw you wearing this watch.
Now I know he'll do anything for you.
In the heart of downtown Sydney,
atop a 58-story high-rise,
is the penthouse suite
owned by Adrian cook,
made his fortune in human trafficking,
specializing in underage sex workers.
He has plenty of manpower
protecting him, of course.
The Sydney opera house
and the harbour bridge.
Cook's paranoia
is only trumped by his ego.
The walls and floors are all concrete,
three-feet thick.
Every door is made
of six-inch nickel chromium steel.
And the biometric sensors
and retina readers at the access points
Mr. Clark.
Good to meet you. Shall we?
So each apartment has over 300
square meters of premium living space.
But this one gets the Sydney sunset.
The specifications
are all in the brochure.
Let me show you
the detailed floor plan.
We've got Italian tiles
running completely across here.
- Oh, excuse me.
- Sure.
Hello? Samantha burns.
Hello?
Sorry about that.
So, where were we?
You were about to tell me
about the floor plans.
Oh, yes.
But we're not dumping on the reef.
"Near" is not on.
And if the tree-huggers
do kick up, well, then...
Yeah. That's right.
Now I've gotta go.
Now I've gotta go.
Everyone, evacuate!
Call the police!
plunged 76 floors
to his death this morning,
when the glass pool
of his Sydney penthouse collapsed.
Give him his call.
Okay.
...described his death
as a tragic accident,
- Ready.
- Go ahead.
Maybe it just needs cleaning.
No. Look closer.
Son of a bitch!
This the harbor master's office?
Yeah, it is.
How may I assist you?
My name is tom silva.
Some bastard in a bloody gray yacht
just scraped my vessel.
I have the hull number,
but my insurance
needs the owner's details.
Wrx 489-674-2239.
The vessel's berth is in
Sydney harbour on pier 7.
The boat you're looking for
is gone, mate.
Head out of the harbor.
It couldn't have gone far.
There! East!
Come out of the sun,
so he can't see you.
Drop it down to 60 feet
and hold it steady.
Got it. I'm heading aft deck.
Hey!
Take him out!
Go.
Go, go!
Bishop!
You know your problem, bishop?
You just can't help yourself.
That's how I knew
you'd come back for her.
That's your weakness.
Now do the third kill,
or the girl's dead.
Take him down below.
And give him a proper sendoff.
Bishop, if you pull
another stunt like that,
our deal is off, and you'll never
see your little girlfriend again.
Go to the port town of varna,
on the black sea.
That's where you'll find
your third kill.
His name is Max Adams,
a wealthy American arms dealer.
On the north side of varna,
you'll find a truly vulgar memorial
and putting in the most
comprehensive security system.
But the interesting part
is what you don 't see.
Hidden in the mountainside
below is the sub pen.
Adams stocks his u-boats with
intercontinental ballistic missiles.
Nobody gets in or out.
Many have died trying.
So, needless to say, this will be
the hardest site to penetrate by far.
On top of all that, krill and cook's
deaths may have Adams on the defense.
You're using me
to take out the competition.
We will dispatch helicopter.
you'll have to deal with
several layers of security.
The building has
its own power system, oxygen supply,
Open the goddamn door.
Please?
Call me when you know something.
That's because he's sitting
right in front of me
here in the safe room, jackoff.
Magnificent.
Even if it is all stolen and looted.
Cube-futurist totalitarianism.
Of course it's magnificent.
Like... dinosaur bones.
Who the fuck are you?
I'm here to talk.
Lose your cell phone?
I should've hired
those guys from Houston.
All right, what is it
that you want to talk about?
I want to help you avoid an accident.
Krill, cook, that was you.
I warned those guys that one day crain
would come after all of us.
Cappuccino? Espresso?
Espresso. No sugar.
Krill was a warlord, and also the
number-one arms dealer in Africa.
Cook used his mining empire as a cover
to control the Asian franchise.
You got Europe, most of south America.
North America, too,
if you count Mexicans.
That didn't leave much for crain.
So I have a deal for you.
Well, I'm a dealer.
We can talk about it.
I've been called
a lot of ugly names over the years,
communist, socialist, racist, fascist...
None of which is true, of course.
Well...
I'm certainly not a communist.
You just admire
their architecture.
I believe in fair play.
I saw the David and goliath story
play out on the frontlines of Vietnam.
Soviets in Afghanistan.
Ethnic cleansing in Bosnia.
Chemical weapons on the kurds.
The little guy is always
gonna need a slingshot,
and somebody's always gonna pay for it.
An arms dealer with a moral clause.
Let's talk about crain.
We both need him gone.
The question is, how do we accomplish
that? He's got an army around him.
We need something tempting enough so
that crain uses his men to go after it.
- What do you have in mind?
- Your submarine pen.
Have them search
for weapons, treasure...
Your corpse.
What?
You'll have to die.
Well, that's easy.
Although it will cost
a tremendous amount of money.
You can afford it.
Are the boats all secured?
Yes, sir.
- Batteries charged?
- Yes, sir.
- Fully provisioned?
- Yes, sir.
You get those Russian girls
in here last night for the crew?
Yes, sir.
Well, looks like we're ready to go.
Stay here.
There was an explosion,
and Mr. Adams fell into the water.
His security, they tried to reach him,
but the rocks came down,
and he was buried under the water.
Gone.
Oh, my god.
I never imagined that dying would be
so goddamn invigorating!
Stay out of sight for two days.
After that,
you can invigorate all you want.
You calling for the driver?
Making dinner reservations?
Checking in with mom?
I'm calling crain
to make sure he takes the bait.
You do know how to put on a show.
There's a pier
a few miles north of varna.
Be there tomorrow with the girl.
Not until I see Adams' body.
You'll find him
with his most prized possessions.
Get over there. Find Adams' body.
Secure everything inside the pen.
And... what about bishop?
Kill him.
Jeremy, point the camera forward,
so I can see.
All right. Let's go. Fan out.
Where the hell is bishop?
Sir, it's clear.
Two-one clear.
- Contact right rear.
- Take cover!
Take cover! Take cover!
Go, go, go!
Motherfucker!
Anything?
No sign of him, Mr. crain.
Stay sharp. Bishop's coming.
You can count on it.
- What's going on?
- Your boyfriend's coming to die.
And you're the bait. Move!
Come on, bishop.
I know you're not going to let her die.
Clear.
Nothing here.
Yeah, we're clear.
Bring her to the bridge.
Let's move.
Let's go. We have three minutes
before it blows.
Gina. You okay?
I'll be fine.
Let me see. Oh, shit.
I saw crain doing something
on the console.
What's going on?
Crain is trying to kill us.
Let's go.
Move this shit on the boat, now!
Yes, sir.
- What is this?
- Just get in.
Wait. What are you doing?
Making sure you live.
No! Come with me! Bishop!
- There he is!
- Bishop!
Find him. Now!
- ...move!
- Fletcher!
Let's get going-
you never asked why.
I know why.
'Cause I got out, and you didn't.
And here we are again.
You deserted me.
It's time you paid for that.
No chance.
You're gonna get your third kill.
But this one won't look like
an accident.
You're a dead man, bishop.
You might get off the boat,
but you'll never swim far enough away
before she blows.
Who said I was swimming?
Bishop!
Bishop!
Bishop!
Hey!
Hey!
Were there any survivors?
No.
So bishop never made it.
Even legends die.
Dear Mei. I'm back
in Cambodia with the kids.
Thank you so much
for your generous gift.
Bishop would have loved it.
See you soon. I hope.
Clever son of a bitch.
Sneaky bastard.
Bang. You're dead.
