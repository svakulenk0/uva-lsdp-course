Send him back.
I can't.
I can't.
There's no place
it won't catch up to you.
It's what you are, Jason, a killer.
You always will be.
Go ahead, go on, go on!
Do it! Do it!
She wouldn't want me to,
that's the only reason you're alive.
Who is "she"?
Marie Kreutz, his girlfriend.
She was killed in India.
The director of operations
Ward Abbott arranged it.
So we have a dirty section chief
who kills Bourne's girl.
Bourne comes back for revenge, tapes Abbott's
confession, and Abbott commits suicide...
Now Bourne's gunnin' for us.
You couldn't make this stuff up.
Bourne's last confirmed location
was Moscow, six weeks ago.
- Right.
- He's on the run, he's dangerous...
Now, Sir, with respect, I think,
something else could be going on here.
What... what's he after?
The reason that Bourne went to Moscow
was to see the daughter of his first target.
What's your point Pam?
Maybe he was retracing his steps.
Just looking for something...
something in his past.
Maybe he hasn't found it yet.
We need to know, what it is.
You're telling me, he's not a
threat to this agency?
I think if he wanted to hurt us
he could have sent the tape to CNN...
Maybe he still will.
My number one rule is:
"Hope for the best, plan for the worst. "
As far as I'm concerned, Bourne's still
a serious threat, until proven otherwise.
- Let's keep looking!
- Yes, Sir.
This one's from three years ago.
He had half of INTERPOL after him.
He turned up in Naples, Berlin,
Moscow, disappeared again.
Girl that he was on the run with.
Marie Kreutz.
She was found dead in a river,
halfway round the world.
She'd been shot in the head.
What connects the dots?
Turn off the tape recorder.
Where is my sister?
Why don't you sit down?
Where is she?
She's dead.
She was killed.
I'm sorry.
I knew this can end this way.
- It was always gonna end this way.
- I didn't believe that.
And how did she die?
She was shot.
We were together in
India.
He came for me.
You killed him?
Yes.
And now what?
Someone started all of this.
And I'm gonna find him.
Hey, It's me.
Yeah.
He knows the whole story.
Bourne's just the tip of the iceberg.
Have you heard about
Operation Blackbriar?
I'm gonna get my head around this and type it up.
I'll see you first thing. Ok.
I have a hit on Echelon - Blackbriar.
I repeat, Blackbriar.
Looks like it's coming
from a European signal.
NSA please confirm, your receipt.
Sir!
What've you got?
We intercepted a call in
London, keyword "Blackbriar".
Ok, send it to New York right away.
Track the phone?
Registered to a London reporter
named Simon Ross,
works at The Guardian newspaper.
You're tracking him?
Uh, yeah. Thanks, Mike.
We have a survey team covering him at work,
and a sneek-and-peek's on their way to his apartment.
Now, who talked to him?
How did he find about Blackbriar?
I don't know, we've pulled his background and
we've run a crosscheck on known anomalies...
We come up with nothing, but I think
if we follow Ross we're going to be able...
Ross is easy,
we want the source.
Have you heard about
Operation Blackbriar?
I'm gonna get my head around this and type it up.
I'll see you first thing. Ok.
- That all?
- Yeah.
I want rendition protocols and put
the asset on stand by just in case.
People, listen up! This is
a full priority situation.
- Jimmy, gimme Ross's profile on one.
- Yes, sir.
Our target is a British national.
Simon Ross, a reporter.
I want all his phones,
his blackberry, his apartment, his car,
bank accounts, credit cards,
travel patterns,
I want to know what he's gonna think
before he does.
Every dirty little secret he has.
And, most of all, we want the name and
the realtime location of his source.
This is NSA priority level 4.
Any questions?
Alright, let's get do it.
Rogue CIA agent kills six people
Agency probes identity of Jason Bourne
Simon Ross
Security Correspondent
Who is Jason Bourne?
Part 3 of a special report
His code name was Jason Bourne, but he
had many identities, each one seemingly
more deadly then the next. To the world
he was invisible - One of the CIA's secret...
Germany's BND are working with police
in southern India on an investigation into
the death of a German woman,
believed to be an accomplice of Bourne's, who
drowned in January in a river
after her car skidded off a bridge.
Copy that. Mr. Wills, subject is entering
his office.
- Get some eyeballs out on the street.
- Where is my picture, please?
Coming on-line.
On-line, now.
Jimmy, how're you doin' with
the phone line?
Ah yeah, we have an office line, we're
working on his cell.
- How long?
- One hour, sir.
That's too long.
So how do we know he's not
spinning for someone?
- There was more, he was scared.
- Scared about what?
Blackbriar.
- Sorry, call for you.
- Who is it?
Won't give his name.
Excuse me.
- He's on my line.
- Thanks.
Simon Ross.
Why aren't we hearing this?
Jimmy! That's a hard line,
Jimmy, why don't we have it?
We have his line
sir, he's not on it.
He's using a different phone.
- Who is this?
Waterloo station, south entrance,
Ok guys,
let's work, come on.
Where is he going?
- He is the move.
- Give me eyeballs on the street.
- Subject's exiting the building.
- Find out where he is going.
- Mobil 1, I need audio.
- Audio engaged.
Mobile 1, should have it, Mobile 1,
should have it. Get Mobile 1 on it.
Let me know when you hear it.
Waterloo station,
south entrance.
Mr. Wills. - Keep going. -
destination is Waterloo Station.
Ok, Waterloo Station. Give me
eyes at Waterloo. Put everyone in play.
Let's activate the asset.
- Do we have the bridge yet?
- Not yet, sir.
Ok, Mobil 3, tell 'em to stay back.
Sir. Please, maintain
visual contact.
A prepaid phone.
There you go.
Mobil 1, give me the
subject's current location.
Copy that. Sir, subject is arriving
to the South Entrance at Waterloo Station.
Hello?
Jimmy, I need that phone.
I want you to listen very carefully
to what I'm about to tell you.
What the hell's going on?
At 10:00, to your left,
across the street,
there's a silver Chrysler Voyager, there's
a surveillance team inside.
Directly cross the street, 12:00 noon, there's a man
on the second storey, static post, he's watching you.
and there's a bus stop, 50 meters to your left.
I want you to walk towards it.
Jimmy, I need that
phone. I need it yesterday.
He's on the move,
he's on the move.
- That's not his phone,sir.
- Say again.
That's not his phone,sir.
Where the hell did
he get another phone?
- Grab Team B, we're in position.
Alright, there's a man in a blue hooded sweat-shirt,
he's talking on a phone. Walk directly to him and stop.
Jimmy, we need the call,
I need that cellphone!
Do not let him
get out of sight.
Alright, turn around.
- Ok, who's the guy in the blue hood?
- Is that his contact?
There's a bus coming, it'll be there in 10 seconds.
When it stops, I want you to walk directly...
to your left, there is an overpass.
Go up the stairs, stop at the newsstand.
- You'll get further instructions
- Ok, Ok.
Get ready to move.
Watch that bus, watch that bus!
What is going on? Somebody tell me,
did we lost the feed!
Grab Team B, intercept the
contact and stay with Ross.
Stop!
Mobil 1, target's on the move!
Ok, he is on the move.
Do not lose Ross!
Blue hood, on
the ground, now!
Oh, shit!
What the hell was that?
Sir, we've lost all
communication with Mobil 1.
Alright, heading west, let us
know when you have a visual!
- What was the last known position, please?
- On the walkway, heading straight to concourse, sir.
Surveillance nightmare, it's
the busiest terminal in London.
- Give me all of CCTV eyes.
- I'm on it, sir.
Who's your source?
What's his name?
What's your source's name?
Look, what's going on? Why
are these people after me?
Because you found something. You talked
to someone inside Treadstone.
Someone who was
there at the beginning. Who is it?
- You know I can't tell you that.
- You have no idea what you're into here.
These people will kill you
if they have to.
- Was it Blackbriar? Is that what this is?
- Blackbr... What's Blackbriar?
A Treadstone upgrade. My
source told me it all started with you.
He said you were square
one. The dirty little secret.
He said he
knows, who you are.
Alright, we have to move.
Answer your phone.
Where the hell is he, people?
Do exactly
as I say.
When you move up to your right. First
escalator on the right.
Tie your shoe, tie your shoe,
right now, tie your shoe!
Wait. Wait.
I'm gonna walk by you, I want you to
move along to fore wall to your left.
In 4, 3, 2, 1,
stand up. Ok.
Where the hell is he?
We cannot afford to
lose this guy, people.
Alright, that line you're on is good.
Stay on that line. Stay on that one.
Oh no, the big man, I think
he's one of them.
- Negative.
Oh, Jesus. Jesus,
he's reaching for something.
- Ah, God! He's got a gun, he's got a gun.
Ok, there he is. Here we go.
Grab Team A, go.
He's still
talking to somebody.
He's getting instructions.
Jimmy, gimme the conversation.
Hurry Ross?
You've got to move.
Move through this crowd, Move through this crowd,
get in cover right now, move through this crowd.
Get in the store. There's someone
on your tail. Get in the store.
You're going to proceed out the right exit that's
to your right as you come into the store.
Head into the liquor store in front of you.
Go to the back and lock the door.
Mobil 4 is down.
- This guy has got help.
- Tell me when the asset is in the nest.
Give me a feed in there.
I want Grab Team C there.
Tell me what's going on!
Jesus Christ!
That's Jason Bourne.
He's picking us apart.
Do you think he's the source?
He's gotta be.
Block all the exits. Give
the asset a green light.
Take them both out.
Stay there.
I'm gonna get us outta here. You gotta
do exactly what I say.
Listen. This isn't some story
in a newspaper, this is real.
Did you understand me?
Ok.
Pull all of agents back. Give Bourne's location
at the back of the store to the asset.
Yes, sir.
Kill the cameras.
- Wait, something's not right.
I can see the entrance from here.
If I go now I can make it.
- Just stay where you are.
- I am going for it.
- No, not.
We have a situation...
- Yes?
- Director Kramer would like to see you.
- You need to get those warrants...
- He said it's urgent.
What the police will tell me is that they believe
that the victim is 35 year old Simon Ross,
a well known journalist based
here in London, with Guardian newspaper.
It appears that her was gunned down right in
the middle of Waterloo Station, of course,
in full view of hundreds
of commuters...
- Good morning. Can I take your order?
- Yes. I'll have...
the heart healthy omelet with goat's
cheese and peppers, please.
- Anything for you, ma'am?
- Only coffee, please.
- Sure? I'm buying.
- I'm good.
So, when the director called
and it was suggested that we bring you...
Suggested? Are you sure
it was just a suggestion?
It's funny how different things look,
depending on where you sit, right?
I look at this as a
favour for you, Pam.
I am giving you an opportunity
to complete some unfinished business.
- Meaning...?
- Bourne.
He's here. He's a
threat. And we both want the same thing.
- And we both go about it in two very different ways.
- Past is passed, Pam.
- You were careless in Stockholm.
- So what was Waterloo? Just careless again?
We had a leak.
A serious national security situation.
Bourne showed up on our surveillance
and we had very little time to react.
And a reporter
got killed.
Bourne saw us coming. The question
it is: what was he doing there?
No, the real question is: how you managed to get
into a fire-fight at a public train station?
You know, as well as I do, decisions
made in realtime are never perfect.
Don't second guess an
operation from an armchair.
I'll see you at the office.
Enjoy your egg whites.
People!
Pamela Landy and her
associate, Tom Cronin.
She's going to be quarter-backing the search effort.
Say your name and state your specs please.
Well let's do names later, ok?
What's Bourne's last fixed postion?
London, 12:00 noon.
Status: What is he,
armed, wounded?
Alive, mobile and
unknown.
- Do you have an Echelon package?
- Yes.
Why isn't it on?
- We were waiting.
- Waiting for what?
Listen. People, do you
have any idea who you are dealing with?
You are 9 hours behind the toughest
target have ever tracked.
I want everyone to sit down,
strap in and turn on all you've got.
That would mean now!
Thank you!
Give me a team deployment plan.
I want everything
you've got on Ross on Screen 1.
Sir, I think we have something.
We just hacked Ross's
e-mail account at the Guardian.
We found a round-trip ticket to Turin, Italy,
yesterday 08:00 arrival, 12:05 departure.
I think can be pretty certain that
Bourne is not your source, then.
How?
Ross's call to his editor, where
he said he'd just met the source...
took place just after
his Turin flight landed.
He met his source in Turin
- So?
- So what,
Bourne met Ross in
Turin for the breakfast,
then, the same
day, Bourne calls Ross...
to demand him meet at Waterloo?
Maybe they were even on the same flight.
Cross-check the secure cellphone usage
of everyone with SCI clearance.
Yes, all calls going in and out of Turin,
Italy, the morning that Ross was there.
The guy you're after is a CIA operative,
with clearance above top secret,
he's committing treason by talking to Ross.
Do you really think while doing that he's going
to use a cellphone that he knows we can track?
- Zero results on the cross check.
- So you got any better ideas?
Yeah, look at all the people
whose cellphones were switched off...
the entire period Ross
was in Turin.
I mean if your people are on their phones as
much as mine, the list should be pretty small.
Three names: Tom Brewster,
Jack Boulin and Neal Daniels.
Now check everything in Ross's apartment
against those names.
Check for common patterns.
Anything that indicates who Ross met.
Pull it up. Is that documents?
Over here. Who's that?
Right there. Initials.
Hold that. Bring that up on main.
Neil Daniels.
He's station chief in Madrid, isn't he?
Call the RSO at the embassy
and take Daniels...
into custody if he is there. Anna,
get Grab Teams for...
Calle Norte safe house.
Send them in heavy.
Tell them we'll assist with the entry.
- Heavy? Daniels is not it...
- I am worried about Bourne.
If he is not the source, then he is
after the source. The same as we are.
- ETA team 2?
- Three minutes to the destination, sir.
Your mission will save
American lives.
Will you give yourself to this program.
I can't.
Again.
Sir, they're at the front door.
- Five seconds.
- Bring it up live.
We're in.
The alarm is down.
That's gotta be Bourne.
- The safe is empty.
- Shit!
Looks like he left in a hurry.
Track Daniels's passports.
Damn it. Get a backup team in there.
Get me a secure line.
Get the second team over there now.
What are you doing here?
I was posted here after Berlin.
Where's Daniels?
Where is he?
Hello?
Who is this?
This is Nicky Parsons.
She was Treadstone, logistics.
She was with us when
we hunted Bourne in Berlin.
Nicky, I need to do an ID challenge.
Code-in: Sparrow.
Response: Everest.
Nicky, this is Noah Vosen.
How long have you been on site?
I just walked in.
We have two officers on site.
Are you in contact with them?
They are down. Unconscious,
but alive.
- Any sign of Neal Daniels?
- No.
Nicky this is
Pam Landy.
We have reason to believe there is a connection
between Neal Daniels and Jason Bourne.
Bourne? You're still looking for Bourne?
I thought that case was closed.
No. Some people are convinced
he's still a threat.
I disagree, but to find out
I need to talk to him.
Hold on, Nicky.
- What the hell are you doing?
- Trying to send him a message.
You don't think Bourne is a threat?
He just took out two more of my men.
The only way this has a happy ending
Noah, is if we bring him in alive.
He is going after Daniels.
He wants revenge Pam and the only realistic
way to end this is to eliminate the threat.
How long until backup?
Nicky, I need that you
to stay put and secure the premises.
Backup will be arriving in approximately
one hour, do you copy?
Copy, sir.
- How long do I have?
- Three minutes.
My car is outside.
I know where Daniels is.
Operator, where
is the emergency?
Come on.
- Where was Daniels headed?
- At 8:00 this morning...
He wired US $100,000
to a bank account in Tangier.
That's 300 miles away. If we hurry,
we can make the morning ferry.
- Where are you parked?
- To the right. About 20 meters.
Near side of the street.
- They are coming.
- Keep moving.
Two subjects seen exiting safe house.
What the hell is this?
- Understood.
- What the hell just happened?
- We've lost visual contact with the subjects, sir.
- Christ!
Issue a standing kill order on
Jason Bourne, effective immediately.
Send a system wide alert
to all Spanish contacts.
I want all air and
ground border exits shut down.
What's going on?
What has Daniels got?
What is operation
Blackbriar?
You want to tell me or should
I call Kramer and ask him?
- For Christ's sake Pam, are in the middle of an operation.
- Bullshit.
You want Jason
Bourne? Level with me.
Operation Blackbriar started as
an NEAT surveillance program.
What is now?
It is now the umbrella program
for all our Black ops.
Full envelope intrusion,
rendition, experimental interrogation.
It is all run out of this office.
We are the sharp end of the
stick now, Pam.
Lethal action?
If we have to, sure.
That's what makes us
special No more red tape.
No more getting the bad guys caught
on our sites, then watching them escape...
while we wait for somebody
in Washington to issue the order.
Oh, come on!
You saw the raw intel, Pam.
You know how real the danger is.
We need these
programs, now.
What's the connection
to Daniels?
He ran all of our operations
in Southern Europe and North Africa.
So he has everything.
Names, dates, ghost sites, who's cooperating
with us abroad - every operation.
Do you want that stuff in Bourne's hands?
Out on the market to the highest bidder?
I don't think so.
Bourne's not after money.
He's after Daniels for a reason.
Well, what does it matter
what Bourne is after?
When we find Daniels, and
believe me, we'll find him,
if you're right,
we get Bourne too.
Why did you come back?
Why are you looking for Daniels?
Do you know who that is?
That's Daniels.
I don't know who that is. Who is he?
He was there at the beginning.
I remember meeting him.
The first day. Daniels
brought me to him.
That's where it all started for me.
Something happened with me.
I need to know what it was.
Or I will never be
free of this.
Daniels said the
training was experimental.
Behaviour modification.
They had to break down the agents
before they became operational.
He said you were the first one.
Why you helping me?
It was difficult for
me... with you.
You really don't remember anything?
No.
We have to move.
Sir, Mr. Wills. You're gonna
want to look at this.
He is in Tangier.
Noah Vosen.
We have found Daniels.
They just tracked Daniels' passport
to a hotel in Tangier,
they are holding up a bank transfer
made keep him in place...
while they bring an
asset up from Casablanca.
They're going to take him out?
- Yes?
- It is Pam Landy, she says it's urgent.
- Tell her I'm unavailable.
- Yes, sir.
Sir, asset
has arrived at the airport.
Give me the subject's location.
Subject is now on foot and
entering Hotel Velásquez.
Hotel is the
I want an elevation and
a floorplan tic-tac-toe.
Locate the room.
Give the asset subject location and the route
between the subject's hotel and the bank.
- Do we have that room yet?
- Yes, sir. Room 117.
Get a hold of the hotel trunk line.
Run all calls through here
with an iso. on on room 117.
His location's being blocked the firewall.
No, they found Daniels,
they know where he is.
- They will order one of the operatives to terminate him.
- Find out who.
Desh.
Tell him you're going to meet him
and you have a new phone for him.
If you stop Desh,
they will just get someone else
We're not going to stop him,
we're going to follow him.
He'll take us right to Daniels.
Sir, the asset is deviating off course.
Let it play.
Asset unscheduled stop.
Sir, asset is on the move.
En route to subject.
Sir, we have an unauthorized breech.
Someone with active system
knowledge penetrated in our protocol.
Instructions were sent to the
asset at 14:11 local time.
The trace is confirmed and valid.
I came from a computer belonging to Nicky Parsons.
Where did the course deviation occur?
South to Rue de Belgique.
Stationary Place de France.
That's where Parsons is.
When we're finished with Daniels,
send the asset after her.
Yes, sir.
If we find Parsons, we find Bourne.
Noah, what are you doing?
- Not now.
- I want to know that is going on.
I said not now.
What basis are you
continuing this operation on?
On the basis that Nicky Parsons
has compromised a covert operation,
she is up to her neck in this.
- This is about Daniels, not Nicky.
- She betrayed us.
- You don't know the circumstances, Noah.
- She is in league with Jason Bourne for Christ sake!
You do not have the authority to kill her.
Oh yes I do.
And you had better get on board.
Noah, she's one of us.
You start down this path, where does it end?
It ends when we've won.
When we're finished with
Daniels, send the asset after them.
Yes, sir.
- Two minutes, sir.
- Tell to the bank to release the funds.
Hello?
Mr. Daniels, the
money is available.
He's on the move.
- We are ready to fall in.
- 200 meters.
Ok, come on, I want the
latest preliminary tracking.
Stop!
Go do it. We need
to be dead.
Sir, asset confirms both targets are dead.
I want to be sure about this.
Ask the station chief from
Rabat to confirm the deaths...
and do a Sub Rosa collection of the bodies.
I want to tie this thing off completely.
And keep an eye on Landy.
- Yeah?
Are you sure of that?
Our station chief
in Rabat is confirming.
I cannot afford to have
this come back to me.
Don't worry,
you are protected.
Just remember why we put Landy there.
If Blackbriar goes south, we'll roll it up
and hang it around her neck and start over.
I can see
their faces.
Of everyone I ever killed.
I just don't know their
names.
Marie used to try that.
And alone I remember the names.
I've tried to apologise...
for what I've done...
for what I am...
but nothing makes it any better.
They're gonna come for you again.
You're gonna have to run now.
We should go.
It gets easier.
Those are the belongings
of Sr. Daniels.
- That is everything.
- Yes.
Let to see me that.
The station chief
in Rabat just called.
They found a body.
- Bourne?
- Desh.
Pam, you need to see this.
A passport for Gilberto de
Piento just cleared immigration.
It is early Treadstone identity
registered to Jason Bourne.
But he never used it
and it never went to the grid.
Bourne's alive.
They don't know?
If they knew, Voson wouldn't be
in this office right now.
It's a hell of a risk.
Maybe Bourne wants
us to know.
Just like Naples.
Maybe he's communicating...
Maybe he's trying
to communicate with you.
Then we should communicate back.
I think I know what Bourne is looking for.
Gilberto Del Piento. Gilberto Del Piento.
Your party is waiting for you.
Pamela Landy.
I hear that you're
still looking for me.
Bourne?
- Yes?
- Better get in here, we've got a situation.
I wanted
to thank you for the tape.
I think
I owe you an apology.
Is that official?
- Tracing this?
- 50 seconds trace.
- Good-bye.
- Wait, wait!
David Webb. That's your real name.
You were born the 04/15/71
in Nixon, Missouri.
Why don't you come in
and we'll talk about it.
Something is very wrong here.
Bourne?
Get some rest, Pam.
You look tired.
He is looking
right at her.
People, listen up!
This is a national security
emergency. We have an imminent threat.
I'm going out there.
I will show myself,
he'll find me.
Jason Bourne is alive.
And is at large in New York city, and we
believed within 1,000 yards of this building.
I want an immediate 12
block lockdown of the area.
Send a flash message to Langley,
prep for local backup assistance.
Landy just left the building.
Stay with her telephone.
She is using her cell.
It's an incoming text.
- Get it. How many do we have on Landy?
- 6 men and more on the way.
I've got, sir, coming up on the screen now.
Anyone not on Landy goes
directly to Tudor City.
Get the vehicles, we're going mobile.
There's only one way out of there. Why
would he do that? He's trapping himself.
Bad place to meet. It's too exposed.
He would not have chosen it,
if he didn't have a reason.
Subject is en route.
- Rear 4-3 standing by.
- Standing by.
- Ok folks, here we go.
Fox, 200 meters.
- Visual on leader?
As soon as you have eyes on Landy,
I want to know.
- Here we go.
- Copy that, I see her.
- Any sign of Bourne?
Noah Vosen.
This is Jason Bourne.
I was wondering when you
were going to make this call.
You didn't actually think I was
coming to Tudor City, did you?
No, I guess not.
But if it's me you want to talk to,
perhaps we can arrange a meet.
Where are you now?
I sitting in my office.
I doubt that.
Why would you doubt that?
If you were in your office right now,
we'd be having this conversation face to face.
This is a code 10 abort.
I want everyone back in the vehicles.
This is a code 10 abort.
Move it!
Yeah?
Wills, check
my office.
Damn.
- God damn it.
Alright, set a four block
perimeter around the building.
I want the entire building searched.
Every room, every hallway, every closet,
every god damn air duct,
do you understand? I want him found.
What just happened?
Bourne broke into CRI.
He got into Vosen's safe.
- Where to?
- 415 East 71st Street.
Target in sight.
He's headed east in the Port Authority.
All agents have shoot
on sight authorization.
- Sir, he drove off the roof.
- What?
He drove off the roof.
He's on foot, he's running.
Police, freeze!
Put your hands
in the air!
Sir, sir, take a look at this.
Bourne's birthday, sir.
- What about it?
- Check that out!
Landy told Bourne that his birthday
was 04/15/71.
My god, it's a code.
Everything stops,
Everything stops! Listen up!
Numbers. What does it mean?
Sir, if you plug them in as variables of
longitude and latitude you get... Cameroon.
for Barny, Kentucky.
- What date did she give?
- 04-15-71.
I don't believe it!
SRD is
at 415 East 71st Street.
- Christ!
- Bring all the teams in behind us.
Hurry up! Somebody call
The asset lost Bourne. We lost him.
- Hello?
- Albert, it's Vosen.
Bourne knows everything.
He is coming home, Noah.
I don't know, just
get the hell out of there.
No, I'm going to stay.
He'll head for the training
wing. That's what he knows.
I will keep him in play...
until you get there.
They'll kill you for
giving me this.
My guess is Vosen
is on his way already.
Why'd you do it?
Because this isn't what I signed up for.
What did to
you... Blackbriar...
This isn't us.
Then do
something about it.
Everything that you need is in there.
Everything.
David.
Why don't you come in with me?
It will be better if
we do this together.
No.
This is where it started for
me... this is where it ends.
That's Landy.
Alright, lock this building down.
Set a secure perimeter of one block.
Hello, this is Pamela Landy, I have
send a classified document.
Get a team to SRD after Bourne.
And put somebody in every
public area of this hospital.
- Ok. Elevator, shafts...
- Let's go!
South bank, go.
Gentlemen,this is a priority situation,
you will give us your full co-operation.
Give me playback for the entire the
building for the last 3 minutes.
Go, go!
This one here. Where is this?
First floor.
I'll take Landy on my own.
You'd better yourself a good lawyer.
...we finish with you, you
will no longer be David Webb.
He may not even
remember who he was.
Do you know why we are
treating you like this?
Hello, Jason.
I believe you've
been having problems.
Put the gun down.
I wouldn't be here if I didn't want to talk.
I've spent three years running.
Three years.
Trying to find out
who I am.
But still not got it all back have you?
Still not filled in the pieces.
It was always you.
I'm unarmed, Jason.
Why me? Why did you pick me?
You really don't remember, do you?
We didn't pick you, you picked us.
You volunteered.
Right here.
Even after you were warned.
You came in here.
You didn't even blink, Jason.
You just handed me these.
You said that
you wanted to serve.
You said I'd be saving American lives.
You were.
I was
killing... for you.
For them.
You knew exactly what it meant for you...
if you chose to stay.
When we have finished with you,
you will no longer be David Webb.
You can't outrun what you did, Jason.
You made yourself into who you are.
Eventually you're going
to have to face the facts.
You chose right here...
to become Jason Bourne.
You haven't slept
for a long time, David.
- Who is he?
Or too weak
to see this through?
from now on you will be
known as Jason Bourne.
Do you remember, now?
I remember.
I remember everything.
I'm no longer Jason Bourne.
So now you're going to kill me?
No.
You don't deserve the star that
they give you on the wall at Langley.
Why don't you take the shot?
Do you even know why
you're supposed to kill me?
Look at us.
Look what they make you give.
Good morning, senators.
If I may, I would like to begin...
making a statement for the record.
The file indicates that
Ezra Kramer, authorized...
The President convened an
emergency Cabinet meeting, today,
over an alleged Government
assassination program code-named Blackbriar.
CIA director, Ezra
Kramer, is under criminal investigation
Which several cases may have
even targeted American citizens.
Two Agency officials have
already been arrested.
Dr. Albert Hirsch, the alleged
mastermind of the Blackbriar program,
and CIA deputy-director,
Noah Vosen, the programs operational chief.
Meanwhile, a mystery
surrounds the fate of David Webb,
also known
as Jason Bourne,
the source behind the
exposure of the Blackbriar program.
It's been reported that Webb was shot and
from a Manhattan rooftop...
