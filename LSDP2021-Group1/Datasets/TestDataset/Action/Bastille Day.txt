WOMAN: Regard!
You owe me 300 euros.
Hah!
- Cheeky boy.
- You were... Wow.
- Did you see the face on that nun?
- Yeah. And that old guy.
I thought he was going to faint.
He will when he finds his Rolex gone.
Come back to mine and we'll get high.
It don't get better than that.
That was a high.
Yeah, but that was only an appetiser.
You can do better than me.
MAN: Special Agent Briar,
they're ready for you.
Are you familiar with Deep Net
cryptocurrency transactions?
I don't bank online.
Right. You're a field guy.
Your last op, Anbar,
you were tasked surveillance,
but you did a little more than that.
Without clear visual evidence,
you broke cover to take down six suspects
who you alone had ascertained
were carrying concealed explosives.
I'm curious, are you saying you knew
what they were carrying underneath
their clothing before engaging?
Oh, yeah.
Like I could tell you, Tom...
got tighty whities on, right?
But in the process, you exposed
your key informant, Fatima Hamza.
Two years building her trust,
infiltrating the terror network, wasted.
- It was a calculated risk.
- Really?
Because your Baghdad CO describes you
as reckless, insubordinate
and irresponsible toward human assets.
You recognise that description?
No, but I recognise an asshole
when I see one.
Tom, a minute.
I stuck my neck out
trying to get you this position.
- You have to play the game.
- Oh, yeah.
And you know how good I am at that.
Welcome to Paris.
:
Merci. Merci.
That.
And as ordered...
two Japanese passports.
How about 800?
Baba, that's a genuine Reverso. I could
get two grand for that on George V.
So sell it there.
Nine.
And I throw in Lacoste shirts.
Your crocodiles are sewn on backwards.
You must have enough now, Michael,
to go back home.
Nothing to go back to.
Then, forward.
Everyone has to have a dream.
I'm gonna put myself through med school,
find a cure for Alzheimer's.
Last week, wasn't it Parkinson's?
Really?
You have a good evening... Dr Michael.
Bonsoir.
- Bonsoir.
- Bonsoir.
Bonsoir.
THE AVENER & PHOEBE KILLDER:
Fade Out Lines
Life was full and fruitful
and you could take a real bite
-
MAN: Hey!
But the shadow it grows
and takes the depth away
Leaving broken down pieces
to this priceless ballet
MAN:

REPORTER:
That'll take you up to the Bastille Day
parade. Will it go ahead?
July 14th, Bastille Day,
is our national holiday.
Would America cancel Independence Day?
Would you put away your flags
and your fireworks
or would you hold them higher?
France does not give in to threats.
We will hunt these people down
and make them pay. Merci.
WOMAN:
What have you got?
The French picture is back to front.
We got lucky. Unrelated surveillance of
their Finance Minister five blocks away.
- The same guy shows up in our shot.
- Are we sharing this with the French?
I think the less they know about us
spying on them, the better, don't you?
It could jeopardise our entire operation.
The image has been matched
with one Michael Mason, born in Vegas.
His dad was a casino pit boss,
his mom a realtor.
till Dad took off,
leaving them with gambling debts.
Then the wheels come off.
Drops out of high school.
Outstanding warrants in four states
for short-con fraud.
Skipped bail, fled the country,
entered France on a tourist visa.
Only heard from her son twice
in the last 18 months,
both times collect call
from a payphone in Paris.
She had no idea where he is
or what he's doing.
he's always running from something,
mostly himself."
WOMAN:
We're looking for a data trail -
stolen credit cards, bank accounts...
- Same payphone?
- Yeah?
What are we waiting for? Let's get him.
Same payphone in 18 months,
he lives on that street.
A direct action could compromise
connections to a wider terrorist...
A US citizen kills four people in Paris.
We missed it on your watch. We sit on
our asses while he strikes again?
Briar, this isn't Baghdad, it's Paris.
Red wine, the Louvre, Louis Vuitton.
You can't just start firing.
WOMAN:
Tom's right.
If you can bag him discreetly,
we can get 24 hours with him off site.
- Then the French can have what's left.
- OK.
Just make sure there is something left.
TV: Police have released a CCTV image of a
man wanted in connection with the incident
and the authorities are asking
anyone with information
about the identity of the man
to come forward.
At present no one has come forward
to claim responsibility for the...
Excusez-moi.
He'll avoid surveillance camera coverage.
This street is good. He can get
in and out of here real quick.
Multiple routes of entry and exits.
Good roof access. What's on 44?
- Crack den, raided twice in 12 months.
- 48?
How about 52?
No criminal history,
no registered tenants.
- Cash only.
- Cash only.
TV:..suggests that the timing
of this attack,
in the run-up to France's national holiday
and military parade...
The city remains on high alert
for tomorrow's celebrations.
Crime scene investigations continue
and the area is...
- Bonjour.
- Bonjour.
- Ça va?
- Oui.
Merci.
- Merci.
- Voilà.
Fuck.
Ugh!
-
- No!
Agh!
Ugh! Agh!
Arrêtez!
Urgh!
Move! Come on!
Urgh!
- Urgh!
-
Yeah, motherfucker, now what?
C'est parti.
- Agh!
- Shut the fuck up.
Hey.
- Are you in love?
- Love?
- No.
- Are you writing a novel?
- What? No.
- What the fuck are you doing in Paris?
- I just...
- What organisation do you work for?
Your manifesto says
this is the first strike.
- My...
- Where are you bombing next?
- I'm not a terrorist.
- Is this not you?
That is... I put the bag in the trash.
But I didn't know there was a bomb in it.
- I'm sorry, man.
- Somebody gave it to you?
- I stole it.
- You stole it?
I'm a pick-pocket. It's what I fucking do.
- You didn't look inside?
- Yeah, I looked inside.
- You didn't see the bomb?
- There was just crap in there.
It was a wig, a toy. I put it back.
I swear to God. I'm really sorry.
- I didn't... I'm sorry.
- Shut up!
Focus!
I didn't know what was in that bag.
But you ran and you made me chase you,
and innocent people do not run.
You were coming after me.
Have you seen yourself?
What I need you to understand
is this does not look good for you.
One phone call and you're on a phantom
flight to the middle of nowhere,
off the grid.
You would not be missed.
It wasn't my bag.
I swear to God.
Whose was it?
Er... this girl.
- Describe her.
- OK. She was pretty.
She had brown hair and a blonde wig.
She had a bag. Her body language made me
think there was something valuable in it.
Two pounds of Semtex. Well done.
That's her phone. That was in the bag.
It rang and I answered it.
Some French guy, he called her Zoe.
- Where'd you steal it?
- Pigalle.
If I go to surveillance cameras,
I see you stealing it?
- I only work blind spots so no cameras.
- Yeah.
Because you don't have a record in Paris.
No thefts, no pick-pockets,
no stolen bags.
- Just this motherfucking terrorist money.
- That is from selling the stuff I steal.
- Who do you sell it to?
- I have a guy.
- Where?
- In Barbès.
You must be really good.
Overall number one draft pick
of pick-pockets.
I'm the best.
You'd better be.
Walk up to me and steal my wallet.
OK.
I wouldn't have a guy come up to me in
the street and ask me to steal his wallet.
- It doesn't work like that.
- Just do it.
OK, OK. Er...
Well, I'd walk up to the guy,
avoid eye contact,
step to the side, look him in the eye
and then I'd be gone.
- Still there.
- But the money's gone.
See, I took the wallet the first time
and then put it back the second,
only without the money.
It's all about the distraction.
You were too busy watching me
to see what I was doing.
Give me that.
Sit down.
Bonjour.
Bonjour.
Zoe Naville?
Sorry, I think you got the wrong address.
American?
Yeah.
It's cluite specific, this address.
Well, I'm sorry I can't help you.
- Sorry to have disturbed you.
- Yeah.
No problem.
Christophe!
Agh!
Allo? Allo? La police, s'il vous plaît.
Oui.
- You lost him?
- We were compromised.
They were tactical. G-19s and gas masks.
And now we have French police crawling
through an unlisted agency safe house.
This was a bag job, not urban warfare.
How the hell were you compromised?
Two ops looking for a girl called Zoe.
All right?
Mason said he stole a bag from a girl
called Zoe. She's the key.
You need to get Mason before the French
know we're digging in their front yard.
They tracked her phone.
Get me everything off it.
- Briar...
- Mason has a fence at Barbès.
We get him, we get the girl,
we get 'em all.
Your mission is Mason.
Karen's put herself on the line for you.
She's stalling the French.
Get Mason before this blows up
in our faces.
Our prime suspect.
A witness came forward
and identified him as an American.
American?
Do you have a name?
Not yet, but a possible sighting.
Paris police are investigating
a violent disturbance
in an apartment block
in Rue Saint Vincent.
Neighbours placed the suspect
at the scene and...
...a black man with an American accent.
Go on.
The police report says the apartment
had some sort of...
...hidden interrogation room.
Terror links?
No, it smells like...
...intelligence.
And what does intelligence smell like?
Karen... we go way back.
I have four bodies on the street
on the eve of Bastille Day.
- If you have any information...
- If I did... I would tell you.
You know that.
Of course.
- Of course.
- How's the wife?
Expensive.
Monsieur.
Bon. Alors, messieurs...
Allez.
Sale race!
KAARIS:
Je Remplis L'Sac
L'Americain.
Hey, Baba.
You plant that bomb?
I stole the bag.
I didn't know what was in it.
Please, Baba, I need somewhere to hide.
- I never took you for that kind of guy.
- And I'm not.
- Look, please, Baba, you know me.
- Do I?
Do I?
You owe me.
All right. All right.
Follow me.
Wait here.
Donne-moi la clé.
Agh!
Agh! Agh!
J'ai un visuel.
Get in!
Fuck!
Putain!
That fucking cop was gonna shoot me?
You're a terrorist bomber.
You killed four people.
Put your seatbelt on.
Anti-fascist protests are growing
in the north of the city this morning
after a spate of unprovoked attacks
on mosques.
Online activists are questioning
the heavy-handed police response.
Zoe.
RADIO: The French have found
bomb equipment in a mosque.
- Looks like they've found a cell.
Those two guys that hit me
weren't from no mosclue.
So we pass her details on to the French.
Your job was to find Mason
- I'm working on that.
What did you find from that girl's phone?
Her phone data connects to an activist
squat. Rue Duris, Clichy-sous-Bois. Why?
I'll tell you later.
So, what, you CIA?
You got a name?
- Briar.
- Is that a first or last?
It's the only one you're gonna get.
The city's under threat.
We need to find that bomber girl.
You'll identify her.
Until we do that, that shit is on you.
I'm just a thief who stole a bag.
Just charge me
and we'll straighten this out.
Not gonna happen.
Want another red dot on your chest?
- I'm not a terrorist.
- Hey! You stole a bag.
You left it there. Now, man the fuck up.
- We got a job to do.
- This is crazy.
- I don't work for the CIA.
- Well, you do today.
BASTILLE, ANGEL HAZE, F*U*G*Z, BRAQUE:
Weapon
Hey. I wonder if you can help me.
- I'm looking for my friend Zoe.
- I don't know a Zoe.
- Who are you?
- Ben from the G8 protests.
- Zoe said to stop by sometime.
- I don't know you.
Patrice!
- Patrice!
- Sshh!
Come here. Open up.
- Open up.
- Ugh! Ugh!
What's your name?
- Tamir.
- Tamir, where's Zoe?
- She's not here.
- So where's she hiding?
-
- Please, she's innocent.
Whoa! Stop!
Out.
Get in.
- I thought you were gonna shoot him.
- I'm trying to stop a bomb.
You put a gun in his mouth,
you didn't even blink.
- Moral lessons from a pick-pocket.
- I don't threaten to kill anyone.
No, you actually kill them.
You're wasting your time. They're gone.
Look through these.
Those guys are on there.
So, what am I looking for?
Peroxide guy. He's in her photos.
- So?
- Michael, we're the CIA.
We got a lot of equipment.
We can get a face recognition.
Or we just go to where he works.
Where?
- What happens now?
- We wait for him to show up.
Jesus!
Don't touch that.
I'm not a drug dealer, all right?
You know, I'm not some fucking lowlife.
I got plans.
Like what?
I'm raising money to fund my way
through med school.
Bullshit. You know, you look left
when you lie. It's a very common tell.
You don't fucking know me.
Age 14 through 16, you were caught
shoplifting for pornography
and Britney Spears CDs.
You stole your stepdad's car and crashed
it into the Caesars Palace fountain.
Categorised as impulsive, lacking
of insight and very likely to reoffend.
OK. How about lacking
in interpersonal empathy?
Reckless, insubordinate and irresponsible.
Quick to resort to violence.
Motherfucker, you go through my pockets
again, I will shoot you in the face.
- Jesus, man, I was just...
- Shut up. He's here.
What's the play?
- You gonna stick a gun in his mouth too?
- No.
If they see me, they'll move her.
They didn't get a good look at you.
- No way.
- Come on. You wanna clear your name?
That guy in there knows where Zoe is.
Go in there, get me a lead.
- No fucking way.
- Listen, Michael, this is an opportunity.
The agency,
they don't just recruit Ivy League types.
They need people like you, street smart.
You know, we're not too different,
you and I.
I was just a street kid adopted
from Belize.
No value system, no parents, no English.
Nobody gave a fuck about me.
I want a deal.
We get the girl, she confirms my story,
I'm free and clear.
Deal.
Pinky promise.
Get the fuck out of here.
C'est la police. C'est toujours la police.
BLACK GRAPE:
Reverend Black Grape
-
- Tony.
- She's at his place.
- You got an address.
Good job.
- That was intense.
- Yeah, you did good.
You think I got a chance at the agency?
You got potential.
The city's all fired up.
It was on TV back there.
Cops put an Arab protester in hospital.
- Bonjour.
- Bonjour.
See? You can be warm. You're like
a different person when you smile.
Can I get a gun?
Where is she?
Where is she?
I'll kill him!
I'll kill him, OK?
You wanna kill him?
- Go on, kill him.
- Briar?
You're a terrorist, right? Go ahead.
Zoe, right? It was your bag, wasn't it?
You remember? In Pigalle. It was your bag.
With the bomb in it that he stole?
Sshh!
Now, Zoe, I don't have time for this,
all right?
But you're gonna tell me where
the next bomb's gonna be.
I need to know now!
I don't wanna hurt you.
Look at me. Look at me.
I've seen this a thousand times.
I take one look at you and I know
you're not a terrorist. You're being used.
They probably gave you a story,
told you
you're the only one they could trust,
that they'll look after you,
but they lied, Zoe.
You're in a lot of trouble.
No one was meant to die.
Who built that bomb?
Jean. I only knew Jean.
Jean. Where is he?
The guy that gave her that bomb
is at 14, Rue Kleber. Send backup.
Briar, we're a fucking surveillance team.
Your job was to find Mason.
- You what?
KAREN:
- No time. Heading there now.
You are way off the reservation here.
If you do this, you are on your own,
do you understand?
Understood.
- So we're taking her to the cops, right?
- Not yet.
That wasn't the deal.
We turn her in, I'm clear.
You wanna go? Go.
I can't cos the cops still think I did it.
I did everything you asked.
I thought we were a team.
Sorry, man. You're not Ivy League.
You fucking played me.
All that shit about your past, was that
a lie too? You even from Belize?
No, Connecticut, actually.
- I fucking trusted you, man.
- Hey. Shut up.
Get down!
Shit!
You OK?
- Are you hit?
- No.
I'm OK too, thanks.
Who the fuck are these guys?
Who are they, Zoe? Was that Jean's crew?
No, Jean is not like that.
He would never hurt anyone.
He gave you a bomb.
Zoe, we don't have time for this.
Are they planning another bomb?
No, we were not planning anything
and we only had one bomb.
Well, what are they doing?
Give me something. Come on.
Jean said we were fighting back
against the fascists,
- that we were trying to disrupt them.
- How?
I was supposed to bomb
an empty office building.
- Right.
- But I changed my mind.
- And then he came along.
- You can't put this all on me.
- It was your bag.
- I was going to throw it in the river.
Where?
First floor.
Please don't hurt him.
Get her out of here.
Come here.
So you first met him at a demonstration?
- You know why he chose you?
- Chose?
- No, we were in love.
- Zoe, listen to me.
When a man is an undercover cop,
relationships are not what they seem.
No, it's not true.
I believed in him and I believed
in what we had together.
That was his skill.
He had to gain your trust.
Have you done this?
Lie, screw, fuck, use people
to get what you want?
Yeah, he's done that and more.
It's what he does for a living.
Hey, I don't need judgement from you.
BRIAR:
They planned the bomb to go off
in the Nation Pure offices.
To pin it on a mosque?
Karen, someone's playing chess
with the city right now.
I have to give this
to French Intelligence, OK?
Yeah, who are you gonna talk to?
Victor Gamieux. He was my contact
back in Libya. He's OK.
And what about my assets?
- He's gonna want us to turn them over.
- A pick-pocket and a bomb mule?
- I don't.
I'll set a pickup.
D'accord?
Victor.
The bomb was made
by an undercover police officer.
His name was Pascal Fibbert.
He was found hanging last night,
but he was most likely strangled.
Victor, you have a terrorist conspiracy
in the heart of the police force.
The mosque was a setup.
There's something going on.
And you have evidence?
I have a witness. Currently in the company
of one of my agents.
- The other American?
- We're prepared to hand them over to you.
But can you get them into safe custody?
Witness handover needs to be off the books
until I know how far the rot spreads.
They're near the Stalingrad Square,
in Aubervilliers.
OK, call him. I'll arrange a pickup.
Tell him the safe word is Mike Alpha.
Thank you, Victor.
Gamieux's hand-picking his men.
Safe word Mike Alpha.
Thank you for coming to me.
You owe me dinner.
Mike Alpha?
Allo?
OK, à toute à l'heure.
Agh!
Come on, Michael.
TV: While the Bastille Day procession
gets underway,
protesters have opened up
a new front of attack.
The hashtag, Attack The Bank,
has gone viral
demonstrators are surrounding
the National Bank of France.
- Where is she?
All the devices have gone dark.
She went to meet Gamieux
this morning to arrange a pickup.
He's Head of French Intelligence.
Do you know what...?
Karen's dead, Luddy, all right?
She's dead.
Gamieux is dirty
and we need to find out what he's doing.
He is protecting the Bank of France.
He's put RAPID cops in charge.
They've gone to Code Five.
Right, so he's put RAPID cops
to protect the bank
from the riots that he started.
It's all about the distraction, right?
These guys aren't terrorists.
They're thieves.
- What are you talking about?
It's the French National Reserve.
- And we just gave them the keys.
It is impossible to walk out
with that money.
The eyes of the fucking city
are on that bank.
And I order you to come in now
and hand over...
Briar.
Briar!
I'll be on the comms. Listen in.
- And stay here till it's over.
- You're ditching us?
- You won't be any use to me.
- Why are you doing this?
Well, let's just say
I can't stand thieves.
They killed a good CIA officer.
She deserved better.
I mean, what are you doing?
Going in alone, no plan, no backup?
You read my report.
I'm reckless and irresponsible.
J'y arrive.
-
- Christophe.
Hey.
- He's trapped.
- He told us to wait here.
- This isn't our fight.
- Four people died because of us.
What can we do? There's only two of us.
No, there's a lot more.
À bas la police!
- Bande de fascistes!
- They just need a push.
Zoe!
- Come on!
- Bande de chiens!
Briar!
Put your hands up.
Now!
Non!
-
- Oui.
- Michael, can you hear me?
- Briar.
A man from the safe house is coming your
way with half a billion in his pocket.
- What?
It's digital currency.
It's in his chest pocket, on a hard drive.
Putain!
Banquiers enculés!
Where are you? I know it's you.
Where are you?
Salope!
Show your face!
BRIAR:
Give it to me.
Give it to me.
The drive.
Descendez-le.
Police! Police!
Allez! Allez!
- You OK?
- Yeah.
- Where's Michael?
- I don't know.
Come on.
Director Gamieux has been praised
for his work
bringing down the gang
of corrupt police officers.
and police are watching
all ports and airports,
Sergei?
- Fuck.
- Don't worry, Michael.
I'm here alone.
I'm not here to arrest you.
I'm here to make a deal.
It was a passport you wanted?
I'll give you tickets to Brazil
and $100,000 cash
for the hard drive.
For half a billion?
Trust me, you're not in
a position to negotiate.
You got the cash?
This way. Follow me.
Where are we going?
Just out through there.
Get in there.
Drop your gun... or I shoot your friend.
Who, this guy?
Now what?
I didn't know you were gonna shoot me.
You're still alive. Come on.
Drive.
I gave it to Gamieux.
So where do I go from here?
I didn't even get the money.
Are the CIA gonna reimburse me?
- Guess you gotta get a job.
- A job?
The CIA got anything going?
- Yeah, you can clean the cars.
- Like swept for bombs?
No, buddy. Soap and water.
- What about surveillance?
- I don't think so.
- The mailroom?
- No.
- Come on, man, I got skills.
- I should have shot you in the face.
