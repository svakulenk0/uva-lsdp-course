ELECTRA: Come here, Pearl.
Get back here.
Hello, Pearl.
Come here, girl.
She likes me.
She likes dead fish too.
What압 your name?

I앐 Electra.
Are you one of them?

Retired.
I don앖 believe you.
RATH: I told you...
...if I wanted to kill you...
...I would have already.
Look what she did.
It압 not loaded?
It압 loaded. It압 silenced.
Just shoot.
I could.
I앇 be 500 miles away
before they found you.
How압 that?
Stop! She doesn앖 like it!
I say she압 afraid she might hit you.
Sorry I have the gun?
ELECTRA: You think it was a mistake?
You think I앐 scared?
You don앖 know me!

ELECTRA: I앐 in way over my head.
I just want out.
You got the gun. The key압 on the dresser.

I found you. So did he. You can앖 hide.
I just want my life back.
That압 all.
I앐 sorry.
RATH: I앏l take that.
I need to be alone.
I haven앖 spent this much
time with someone in years.
Neither have I.
Well, the disk....
You앏l get it.
Fuck you.

Fuck you!
Then who the hell압 Miguel Bain?
Who the hell is Miguel Bain?

RATH: Hello, Pearl.
ELECTRA: What앇 they say

RATH: Nothing.
I don앖 need details, just in general.
-Nothing.
-Impossible.
Not really. Not if....
If what?
The CIA or lnterpol....
What압 on this?
It압 encrypted.
Breaking the code on my lap top
could take 200 or 300 years.
Aren앖 you a genius?
I am.
ELECTRA: I was the best.
If it was stored electronically, it was mine.
Was?
Yeah, I앐 retiring too.
I wish I had an insight...
...but it was anonymous,
an intercepted satellite transmission.
ELECTRA: Probably just industrial secrets.
There압 one bed.
ELECTRA: I guess you noticed that.
-It압 yours.
-You want the couch?
No, thanks.
A trick so you don앖 get comfortable?
Tie a string from your toe to the doorknob.
It opens in.
You wouldn앖 feel it.
Yeah, I got it. I understand.
Pearl!
Thanks.
For what?
I don앖 know.
Saving my life, I guess.
How앇 you like to make $1 million?
ELECTRA: What do I have to do?
Nothing cheap, I hope.
What is it?
Tell you tomorrow.
I can앖 sleep.
Be patient.
What? Tell me.
Thanks for the chocolate.
ELECTRA: Good night.
ELECTRA: Forget something?
You be careful.
INTERCOM: Stand back,

INTERCOM: Please keep back

Whatre you doing?
-Drive!

Drive, fast!
RATH: I mean, fast!
Get off this street!
RATH: Stop!
Hit it!
Go!
No money, no disk.
What압 so funny?
I wasn앖 sure you앇 come back
so I switched the disks.
And all they have is file names.
-No, you didn앖.
-Yes, I did.
And they got bubkes. Zero, zilch...
...zot, nix, nada, dry hump, squirt...
...diddley-squat.
I read a slang dictionary once.
Keep reading.
Contractor tried to kill you.
ELECTRA: That압 not good.
ELECTRA: Come here, Pearl.
I have caviar for you.
Come here!
Good girl.
"Caviar" is not a Russian word.
RATH: lkra. I think the word is ikra.
How do you know?
I had a Russian friend, Nicolai.
He told me.
ELECTRA: Had a friend?
RATH: Yeah.
RATH: About 15 years ago he was taken.
He was killed?
Yes, I앐 still alive, you bastard.
RATH: Not this time.
Let압 see how valuable he thinks this is.
Three million?
Four?
RATH: More.
$20 fucking million?
Where do you suppose
this person is right now?
A mile away?
Never thought about it till now.
You quit your job,
you have thoughts you never had before.
Sounds like a mid-life crisis.
Youre right.
Twenty million dollars.
Were partners?
That압 $10 million apiece.
I thought I was a thief.
Passport?
To the bank.
What happened to the hotel?
CABBIE: They had a fire years ago.
Nobody had money to fix it.
-Wait here.
-Okay.
ELECTRA:
Keep the air on and watch my cat.
CABBIE: You got it.
ELECTRA: ls that our bank?
Where our money is?
What압 up there?
He앏l be.
RATH: Hug the wall.
ELECTRA: Careful.
RATH: Go light.
ELECTRA: You okay?
RATH: Ten o앆lock tomorrow morning,
I앐 going in that bank.
He앏l be in the plaza somewhere,
in the crowd.
When he sees me go in,
he앏l make his move up here.
You앏l be in the cafe over there.
You앏l see him when he goes inside.
Then we wait.
We wait.
Tomorrow will be a long day for him.
He앏l begin to doubt himself.
He앏l think he missed me.
He앏l want to see whether
I앐 still in the bank.
Then it앏l be sunset...
...closing time.
He앏l get desperate...
...real desperate...
...but he must leave his rifle...
...inside.
He압 right-handed.
He won앖 take a pistol because
the doors have metal detectors...
...and he앏l be nervous.
When he압 out of sight...
...you come get the rifle.
He앏l shoot you before you go in.
He앏l wait for the prime shot.
When I come out.
He앏l want to see my eyes.
Whyre you so sure?
He loves history.
...in this room...
...in this same window...
...I was here.
Oh, my God.
Your friend, Nicolai. He was taken.
You killed him.
MERCHANT: Gracias.
BAIN: lt압 fine.
Who is it?
WAITER: Room service.
I didn앖 order room service.
ELECTRA: I did.
You should tell me these things.
Where should I put the tray?
Over here압 fine.
What압 going on outside?
The Day of the Dead.
Whatre the flowers for?
The families make a path from
their homes to the cemetery...
...with the flower petals...
...so the souls of the dead
can find their way home.
That압 nice.
Call me anytime for the tray.
Okay, gracias.
Gracias se籍r.
Sounds great, huh? Can we go?
No, he압 here now. I know he is.
So were staying in the hotel.
The enemy of fun.
I got you a beer.
ELECTRA: Hey, Pearl. Come here.
Electra....
I wish I could explain to you why...
...I killed Nicolai.
At the time it was
the right thing to do, but...
...I앐 sorry I did it.
It압 something I았e had
to live with for 15 years.
I used to wish it would happen to me...
...and that앇 be my way out.
Permanently.
But not any more.
Not since I met you.
Electra?
-Comprende ingl乶?
-No.
Too bad you don앖 understand English.
I would like to tell you how wonderful
this cemetery is. It압 gorgeous.
I love cemeteries. I really do. I really do.

lt압 all over the place.
I just killed your brother.
"Contract has been paid...
"...transferred to the specified account."
And her disk?
"You앏l be advised. Good-bye, Robert."
Good-bye.
Let압 get ready.
Don앖 lose this.
Two-way?
They saw you coming.
This is a piece of junk.
Tell me when he leaves the hotel,
I앏l tell you when he leaves the bank.
-What압 this for?
-Just in case.
No. I can앖 shoot anybody.
I can앖.
You almost shot me.
I aimed at the lamp.
Aim at him.
Ever play cowboys and lndians?
-Sure. Everybody did.
-And which were you?
An lndian.
-I was always an lndian.
-Always the lndian.
Just pretend he압 a cowboy...
...and pull the trigger.
Then pretend he gets up after.
But you must pull the trigger.
You았e got to.
I never depended on anyone in my life.
I앐 depending on you.
I don앖 see him.
ELECTRA:
I앐 looking all around the square.
RATH: I앐 in the bank.
RATH: Where do I go for transfers?
Oh, my God!
He압 here.
ELECTRA: He압 going to the hotel.
He압 almost at the door.
He압 going in. He압 going in.
That압 what we wanted.
Relax, try the decaf.
ELECTRA: He must be upstairs now.
Should I stay or go in?
No. Stay? Wait, wait. I앏l just wait.
It압 hot.
ELECTRA: Goddamn, it압 hot.
RATH: I앇 rather be out there than in here.
CLERK: May I help you?
RATH: I앐 expecting a transfer.
CLERK 2:
Se籍r, we have received your transfer.
I앇 like to close the account.
Today?
Close it today?
Right now.
-How would you like the funds?
-American currency.
Would you please step right over there.
I앏l be right back.
No problem.
Mr. Rath?
Youre aware there may be
a withdrawal fee.
Yes, I am.
This will take some time.
I았e got all day.
Take care of him.
BANK OFFICER: Please, follow me.
Right this way.
BANK OFFICER: You may sit right here.
Relax. We앏l get you some coffee.
What are you doing there?
Fuck!
RATH: Talk to me.
ELECTRA: No sign of him.
He압 just sitting up there, same as us.
RATH: I mean, talk to me.
Tell me some of that weird stuff you know.
ELECTRA: Tell you weird stuff.
Like what?
RATH: Tell me ajoke.
May I?
Sure.
Tell me something to distract me.
I앐 not getting paid.
RATH: Be generous.
Once upon a time...
...there was a little sparrow...
...who, while flying south for the winter,
froze solid...
ELECTRA: ...and fell to the ground.
To make matters worse,
a cow crapped on him.
But the manure was warm
and defrosted him.
So there he is, warm and happy
to be alive and he starts to sing.
A cat comes along...
...and he clears off the manure
and eats the little bird.
ELECTRA: The moral of the story is this:
Everyone who craps on you is
not necessarily your enemy...
...and everyone who gets you out of crap...
ELECTRA: ...is not necessarily your friend.
And if youre warm and happy...
...no matter where you are,
keep your big mouth shut.
You like that?
ELECTRA:
I think I앐 running out of stories.
RATH: Keep your eye on that building.
He must be getting impatient.
He앏l make his move soon.
Thanks for the stories.
Sorry I았e been taking up the table.
Thank you. Thank you.
Fuck! Shit! Motherfucker!
Fuck! Shit!
BANK PRESIDENT: We have deducted
our fee and are making a second count.
The funds will be available in a half hour.
I hope you are comfortable.
No, no...no.
Oh, my God. He압 coming.
ELECTRA: He압 coming.
He waited longer than I did.
ELECTRA: Here he is.
Go.
-I have your property.
-Be right there.
Where are you?
I앐 here in room 303.
The rifle should be on the right.
If so, the gun is going to be right here.
It압 not.
What압 happening?
It압 not here.
Listen to me.
Get out now.
Damn it.
Forget the rifle. Get out.
RATH: Have you left?
Found it!
Damn hot day, isn앖 it?
Scorcher.
I got it.
Tell me...
...how did you know?
Who the hell taught you?
History.
Nicolai.
just like you.
That makes you good...
...because I was the best.
Now you feel like a mark.
You think you were sold out.
Don앖 know who to trust.
And you, anticuado?
Who do you trust?
BAIN: No one.
BAIN: Youre alone. Same as me.
I don앖 have it!
I don앖 have the gun.
Why the sunglasses, kid?
Afraid I앏l see your eyes?
Just between you and me...
...I앐 nervous.
I have $16 million in there.
This is where we can change history.
Our history.
I앐 willing to give it to you...
...if you앏l let me walk.
But...
...you won앖 do that.
No.
Excuse me, but...
...you are...
...pathetic.
You sound like a mark.
BAIN: What happened to you?
Nothing. I know where youre going.
I tell you...
...that night in the taxi...
...I thought I was lucky just to be alive.
BAIN: Now...
...I think differently.
You were the lucky one.
I앐 a very, very lucky man.
No more chitchat.
Good luck.
Where are you? Talk to me.
ELECTRA: Can you hear me?
Fuck.
Everything is in order.
Please, come with me.
BANK PRESIDENT:
This is awkward. It압 not really my affair...
...but I was told you would
give us something in return.
Oh God, I앐 fucked. I앐 fucked.
Now...
...we are closed.
BAIN: Step outside.
Step outside...
...and I앏l set you free.
BANK OFFICIAL: Excuse me, sir,
would you please sign this receipt?
BAIN: I got the sword...
...right here.
There is no shame.
BAIN: You won앖 feel a thing.
Thank you for your business.
Youre welcome.
Here he is.
BAIN: Here he is.
Thank you.
We았e got it.
We did it.
Come on.
BAIN: Step outside.
Were in.
RATH: You there?
RATH: Where are you?
You there?
Can you hear me?
Look up.
BAIN: I want to see your eyes,
motherfucker.
BAIN: Look up.
Jasmine?
Howdy.
RATH: Electra!
ELECTRA:  Yes.
RATH: You have something of mine.
I need it now.
Shit!
BAIN: We got something for you here!
ELECTRA: What the fuck do I do with this?
BAIN: Two against one!
Is that your edge, Rath?
You didn앖 take the mark!
You took the bribe!
BAIN:  Don앖 worry!
Don앖 worry, I앏l take her!
He압 serious, Rath!
Even the odds!
BAIN: Are you scared, honey?
I앐 going to find you!
BAIN: I told you I was going
to tear your heart out!
And I will!
I will!
I promise you that!
RATH: Wait here.
I said, stay up there!
ELECTRA: I앐 not going to.
The floor could give way!
RATH: Goddamn it,
why don앖 you listen to me?
MALE VOICE: Don앖 move.
Throw it away.
Throw it away!
That was no way to talk to a lady.
Nicolai.
It압 been a long time.
The years have been good to you.
Miguelito?
Never pictured him so young. A shame.
Second best, after all.
He killed you...
ELECTRA: ...15 years ago.
Yes, he did.
ELECTRA: I don앖 understand.
Walking out of that bank was
the worst moment of my life.
He always went for the heart.
Predictable.
RATH: 15 years.
For 15 goddamn years...
...you let me think I앇 killed you.
Son of a bitch.
Son of a bitch.
Youre forgetting you shot me.
You son of a bitch.
RATH: Why?
Why did you set me up?
The Cold War was ending.
I needed to die...
...to leave no past behind.
You delivered me.
Youre the mark?
You must be the contractor.
I앐 disappointed. You were to kill her.
NICOLAl: Youre a thief.
A good one.
I retired.
NICOLAl: You were so good.
I had to use both my best
to track you down.
There압 something on that disk
that would bring you to life?
NICOLAl: Enough information
to expose us all.
NICOLAl: Especially me.
Can앖 you kiss and make up?
NICOLAl: This is sad for me, Robert.
Sentimental, but...
...I did not want to find you alive.
NICOLAl: First things first.
Don앖 do this.
She압 right.
RATH: She always is.
Female intuition.
Where are you going?
BAIN: To finish something...
...you didn앖 finish years ago.
What?
Just to make sure.
Take it.
Are you going to kill me?
RATH: I never wanted to kill you at all.
BAIN: Help me up.
Will you?
Don앖 even breathe hard.
You want to die?
Help me up.
Thank you.
Now what?
I앐 finished.
What do you mean?
The history stops here.
No more.
I앐 gone.
I quit.
That would make me number one.
Number one.
I can live with that...
...can you?
BAIN: Absolutamente, compa嫡ro.
Then live with it, Miguel.
Live with it.
BAIN: It was very nice meeting you...
...Robert Rath.
It was very dangerous meeting you,
Miguel Bain.
BAIN: You know...
...as long as youre out there...
...I앏l never be number one.
BAIN: Say good-bye...
...Bobby.
ELECTRA: No good-byes.
Good-bye, Miguel.
Thank you.
Wait a minute.
ELECTRA:
You앇 better keep the disk, Robert.
RATH: My real name is Joseph.
ELECTRA: I앐 Anna.
Nice to meet you, Joseph.
ELECTRA: So, Joseph,
let압 go get Pearl a boyfriend.
RATH: Sure. And after that, if you
don앖 mind, I앇 like to go to the hospital.
