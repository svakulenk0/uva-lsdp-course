This is the 8:35 weather
and news for the morning.
Right now, it's 29 degrees
and clear in midtown Manhattan.
Expect passing snow showers
this morning,
clearing by midday,
highs in the lower 30s.
are being treated for
gunshot wounds this morning.
All three were shot in the span
of an hour last night.
Two officers were shot
on the subway.
¶ ¶
- You ready?
- Yeah.
You look very nice.
Thanks.
You sure about this?
Yeah.
Hey, handsome.
Thank you.
Okay.
Don't do anything stupid.
We don't have
any more money left.
What else could I possibly do?
Hey, stop.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Hey! Hey!
Yaya!
Get the fuck out of the truck!
Go! Go!
Go, go, go!
I woke up this morning
feeling very good about this.
Really?
You've been telling me
not to do this for two years.
Now that we're all in,
I'm loving it.
Here we are.
My people have gone
over your books.
I know this is a great deal
of money for you.
So why are you on us
so long for...
for this-this...
Polluted, dirty piece of earth.
I imagine I want it
for the same reason you did.
I'm in the garment business.
I'll take that as a testament.
But I inherited this property
from my Uncle.
Sadly, he had no children
of his own.
He was the one that let them
put these tanks up here.
You see, this place
can do nothing for me.
I offered to lease this site
to you for a very fair price.
But you were not interested.
No.
Why is that?
I like to own
the things I use.
I can see that.
So?
Yes.
Mr. Walsh has reviewed
the contract fully.
Of course.
You brought the money?
Yes.
You know you only have 30 days
to close the transaction.
No extensions.
No contingencies, whatsoever.
I understand.
You fulfill the terms
of the contract,
property is yours.
If you cannot,
we keep the money.
And we sell the property
to your competitor.
Who has been after us
almost as badly as you have.
I like you.
But you should know that
the only reason we choose you
is because of the favorable
conditions of the contract.
And once you sign the...
- I understand.
Well, show us...
The money and, uh,
then I'll sign the papers.
Here it is.
Another case exactly like it.
Right here.
Mazel tov.
Mazel tov.
Congratulations.
- It's not ours yet.
- Hey.
It was a hell of a job
getting them to this point.
This is a good day for us.
Why don't you
take a walk around?
Enjoy it for a second.
¶ ¶
They probably broke his jaw.
Hey, you alright?
Mm-hmm.
Shit...
Have the police been here yet?
Well, he was left on the side
of the highway without a truck,
they brought him here.
Can you speak?
Shit.
Can I talk to you outside?
Yeah.
Did they sign the contract?
- Yes.
- And took the deposit?
Oh, yeah.
- So, it's a go?
- It's a go.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you. You, too.
Alright, we got 30 days.
It's the fucking guys.
This poor kid has been
workin' his ass off.
You want me to talk
to my brother about it?
No. No, do...
do not talk to your brother
or your father about this,
alright?
Okay.
But this can't continue.
I'm gonna go speak
with the da tomorrow morning.
Oh, fuck the da.
He's not interested
in helping us.
Listen, it's not fair to them.
You're at war here.
- No, we're not.
- Really? Because they are.
- Well, I'm not.
You go check on the new house?
Yeah, I'll see you back home.
Do you need anything else?
Mm, mm.
Okay.
I'll be here to pick you up
when you get out.
Thank you.
These men are cowards.
They're too weak
to make a living,
or even fight
with their own hands.
And too stupid to think
of anything else to do.
So, you guys have done
what you needed to?
Yeah.
Then what was that?
I'm sorry?
Well, you just said you've done
what you needed to do.
So... what is it
that you've done?
I'm not exactly sure, you know,
I just got here at four.
My shift's actually up, so...
So, you've done nothing?
Hey, why'd they want it?
They wanted the $6,000 worth
of fuel that was in it.
30 to 33,
are just about ready to go.
You should get over there
and get going.
Andrew,
sorry to keep you waiting.
Mr. Lawrence.
Thanks for seeing us
at the last minute.
Of course.
And Mr. morales.
Didn't realize you were
coming as well.
-Yes.
So, what can I do for you?
We need your help.
In what way?
Our trucks,
they're being robbed.
As much as I'd like
to be able to help you,
you know this is
a police issue.
But this is turning into
an urgent problem for us.
Our drivers are scared
to death.
I'm not sure I understand.
There were more murders
and rapes in this city last year
than there have ever been,
so if you've come to tell me
that we have
an urgent security issue here,
trust me, I'm aware.
My people are at risk just
driving around in this city,
just trying to do their jobs,
and...
I've done everything
that you've asked of me.
It's been two years
since you started
investigating my company.
And since then, I've spent
thousands of dollars
hiring lawyers to provide you
with every piece of information
that your office has requested.
And I expect that you've
been asking the same
of my competitors.
So, with all this information
that you've gained,
we're just asking
do you have any idea
who's been doing this to us?
I don't.
As you know, we've been
investigating industry-wide
corruption in your business,
that seems to have been
going on for years.
So, you're right.
That means you're all
stealing from each other,
which, as far as I can tell,
is just a refreshing new take
on what you've been doing
to your customers
and fellow taxpayers
for the last 15 years.
First,
please know that we respect
the work that you're doing
to try to help our business
But also know that I have never
taken anything from anyone.
So, when you say that we've...
We're on the same side here.
Well, yes and no.
You know...
Mr. morales, you seem like
a decent man.
I don't really feel comfortable
sitting here pretending like
the elephant perched on the
corner of my desk isn't there.
So, you know, I can't go
into specifics right now,
but we believe that
you and your company
have broken the law, and that we
have evidence to prove that.
So next week, we will
be bringing a case against you.
It's a little awkward,
obviously, but, uh...
I didn't wanna have this
happen next week
not having said something
here in person,
you know,
out of respect.
You have your job to do.
But know that you're wrong.
And we will take advantage
of every opportunity
to prove that.
Abel.
Abel.
Exactly.
Let's not overreact.
We don't even know
what this is yet.
We haven't seen any charges.
It could be bullshit.
His office might be
toying with us.
Right now, it's nothing.
I know.
Hey, how'd it go?
Da says he's gonna bring down
charges on us next week.
What?
Why?
We don't know yet.
Look, it might be nothing.
But I need to know...
Where are we exposed?
We follow standard industry
practice on every front.
What does that mean?
You know what it means.
I know.
I need to know
what they're saying we did.
Well...
Look who's here.
Arnold.
Just a touch off the side,
Jimmy.
We can't all be as lucky
as Mr. morales here,
in terms of keeping our hair.
You're a good looking man.
Thanks, Vinnie.
I know I am.
So I hear congratulations
are in order.
What's that?
You got yourself
in contract over there.
Well, we're working on it.
you better be.
We are.
Thanks for your concern.
I saw a couple of your trucks
over in rego park
the other day.
Really?
When was that?
A couple times.
Hm.
It's possible.
Is it?
Yes.
- That's a tough market.
- It is.
My father struggled for years
before he broke in there.
Any new market is a tough one.
See ya.
¶ ¶
babe.
- Everything alright?
- It's done.
It is?
Oh, I love it!
What do you think, girls?
- It's really cool.
- It's amazing.
- Yeah, you like it?
- I love it.
I really like the door.
- You like the color?
- Yeah.
Really cool.
- What's-what's he doing?
- I don't know.
Hey!
Shh!
It's okay.
It's alright.
Ugh! Hey!
Hey!
Come back here!
Come here!
Come here, you fuck!
Where did you go?
- Abel?
-
It's okay.
Come on.
Oh, my God.
Lot of help you were.
Come on.
Ow.
Who was it?
What do you mean,
who was it?
How am I supposed to know
who it was?
I don't know.
It's probably some punk
trying to rip us off.
Ow!
No.
- If you're not gonna
be honest about...
- no, no, look, if he wanted...
...to send a message
or something, he could've...
I don't know what,
and he didn't.
To me, it seems like a message
was sent loud and clear.
Baby, please don't.
Please don't get going on this.
We're in a big, new house.
Probably just wanted the TV.
Mm-hmm.
He didn't have anything on him.
Just some kid.
Lawrence is gonna be in
on Wednesday.
I chased him away.
He's not coming back.
Okay?
'Kay.
Now, you do this
and only this.
You look down at the cloth.
You don't say a word.
You just stare down
at the cloth,
and very slowly,
just start shaking your head.
Then after sitting
in silence way longer
than feels comfortable,
you turn,
and you say,
"I would love to run
a few numbers for you.
Is there somewhere
more comfortable we could sit?
Now, they're almost always
gonna take you to
the dining room table,
and they're gonna
offer you something.
Whatever it is,
always take the fancy option.
Can I get you a coffee or tea?
I would like a tea, please.
We have some homemade
lemonade or a soda.
I would love a lemonade.
Thank you.
Why?
Because...
We're never gonna be
the cheapest option,
so we have to be the best.
And they want...
no.
They need to feel that you
want the best, too.
That's why our trucks
are the newest or the cleanest,
and our drivers
are approachable.
Now, after you've
done the math,
and you've shown them
how much they can save
over the long haul
through proper maintenance,
you need to get them to sign.
But the problem is,
by hiring you,
they need to fire someone else.
And that's never easy.
So...
After you show them the number,
you look up at them,
and stare.
Stare longer than you should.
This is not a joke.
You will only keep this job
if you close,
and that's not funny to you.
I'm only interested
in this company growing,
and when it isn't, it's not
very funny to me at all.
These people work very hard
for their money,
and these other guys
are ripping them off,
treating them poorly,
because they don't know.
So when you look them
in the eye,
you have to believe
that we are better,
But you will never do anything
as hard as staring someone
straight in the eye
and telling the truth.
Well, it was great to meet you.
Welcome.
And I wish you luck.
- You ready?
- Sure.
If there's anything you need,
anything at all,
don't hesitate
to call the office.
I'm sorry this happened to you.
See you soon.
Abel, Abel.
Do you think I'm ready
to move into sales?
No, I don't.
- I don't think
I'd be able to...
- you will.
Get some rest.
Catherine.
Catherine.
Catherine!
Katie!
Where did you get this?
Catherine.
Tell me where you found this.
- Here in the yard.
- Show me! Where?
Come on.
- It was just sitting
right here behind...
- did you see this?
Well, yeah, she went under there
to get that ball
and came out with it.
Maria!
- Is it real?
- Are we in trouble?
Maria!
It's caused by the drift
of soft silt
from the sides of the...
- hey, Debbie.
Can you give us a moment?
- Sure.
What is that?
It's a gun.
It's a fucking gun.
Where did you get that?
Your youngest daughter
found it in the bushes
outside our front door.
She was playing with it.
Look, it's loaded,
with the safety off.
It wasn't some kid
looking to take our TV.
It was a fucking goon
with a loaded gun
looking in our window.
I'll take care of it.
What does that mean when
you say you'll take care of it?
It's not a brick
through a car window,
or another of the
cute little warnings
over the past few years.
This is your kid playing
with a loaded gun.
I know what it is!
Let me deal with it.
Oh, you better.
You're not gonna like what'll
happen once I get involved.
Don't do this.
I won't.
I, uh, need to talk
to you both.
I found a gun outside
our front door.
Somebody left it there
last night.
Who?
We don't know who.
Jesus...
So...
It's not good.
The da's coming down
with charges tomorrow.
Oh, my God.
It's a 14 count indictment.
Three counts
I would consider serious.
They know how
the industry works,
so they're gonna charge us
with rigging scales
and under-reporting income.
We've just pushed it
a little too far, that's all.
Let's look at it like, uh,
a badge of honor.
Huh? We're big enough now,
they even give a shit about us.
Alright, you need
to go home right away,
and start going through
our set of books.
How far back are they going?
I would imagine when
you bought the business
from Anna's father.
I'll get into it.
One other thing,
the bank.
I need you two
to sit down with them.
I set up a dinner.
I want you both there,
just be upfront,
be honest.
I don't anticipate a problem.
God knows they've given money
to bigger crooks than us.
Jesus.
Alright.
How are ya, bill?
I'm okay.
Can't say I'm used
to making house calls
like this anymore, though.
No, it's alright.
You got bigger things
to worry about.
So, uh...
I can't have this situation
with your guys continuing.
- My guys?
- Your drivers.
Yes, yes.
We're good, good.
I would love for you
to help with this
because I can't have it
continue either.
So let them protect themselves,
that would stop
all this very quickly.
I respectfully disagree.
They're picking on your men
because they're
just sitting there, weak.
They're taking shots at me
because I'm growing,
expanding, I'm getting
stronger, not weaker.
I can't have my drivers
getting hit like this anymore.
It looks like I can't
protect them.
Well, it appears
that you can't.
You seem to be under a lot
of pressure from all sides,
which I understand.
Trust me,
I understand it.
So...
Let me think this through.
But whatever decision
I come to,
it stands.
Those men show up
every morning for you
because I tell them to.
You have to realize
that these are dangerous times,
and we have to adapt.
It's not like when
we was driving.
No. No, it's not.
So how did it go?
Not well.
He feels very strongly
about it.
I can see that.
I don't think he
fully understands.
What is there to understand?
Well...
Well, first of all,
it's illegal.
It's not illegal
if I say it isn't.
My responsibility is to provide
safe and timely passage
of goods and products
into and around this city.
And because of this situation,
it is appearing to those,
whose opinions I care about,
that I can't do my job.
That can not
and will not continue.
I-I-I'm not even sure
what you're suggesting.
Are you kidding me with this?
No.
Every driver in your fleet
gets a handgun.
- And a permit?
- Mm-hmm.
When?
By Friday.
Are the permits legit?
That depends on
what they do with it.
They kill their wife with them,
then no.
Then that is
a very fake permit,
and I'll walk away
very quickly.
But they just need to show that
they're defending themselves,
and it'll stop.
Who is it?
I don't know.
I don't fucking know.
Thank you.
Hey!
So I got this machine.
I was paying a guy
five bucks an hour
to do this with me last year.
Peter.
Yeah?
I need to speak with you.
No, I see that.
Look.
I know you've been dealing with
a few of your rigs
getting picked off as well,
but this has all gotten
way out of control.
There was a guy with a gun
at my house the other night.
My wife and children
were home at the time.
Everyone okay?
Yeah, I managed
to chase him off.
What can I do?
I need to know
who's doing this.
- Abel...
-
It's one thing
to go after my trucks
and my drivers
and to steal from me.
This is different.
Have you ever had to deal
with anything like this?
A bunch of thugs
invaded my home
when I was a baby.
Nothing happened.
They were trying
to scare my father.
They ended up just leaving.
We never found out who it was.
But after that,
we moved to a fortress,
just like this.
And those guys who let you in,
they're here to shoot anyone
who isn't invited.
Yes, well, I refuse
to live my life that way.
I won't do it.
I want more than this.
I know you do.
My father's in jail,
as you know.
And...
I always wanted to conduct
myself differently than he did.
And you have.
Almost exclusively, yes.
I know why he did what he did,
'cause at the time,
it's easier.
But it's not.
Yes, it is.
Hey.
They just got another truck.
I know.
Who was driving?
Leo.
Is he alright?
Yes.
You know,
driver's security aside,
this shit is having
a significant financial effect
on this company.
It-it can't continue.
Oh, I know.
How was your talk?
I spoke with him afterward.
I said I wouldn't do it.
I don't think we're in
a position to say that.
What's that?
Why don't you take a walk
with me?
Come on.
Are you serious with this?
This is what it's come to?
We have to walk around outside
like we're fucking gangsters?
I am.
And it is.
It looks like we must do this.
Must?
Yeah, or they'll shut us down.
These men,
they work for me.
The trucks they drive,
the customers they serve,
it's all here
because I built this.
That's true.
Until it isn't.
The last guy in the world
that we want problems with
is the head
of the fucking teamsters.
We're out of business
in a month if they tell
these guys to walk.
We don't have the cash.
It will be the end of everything
we have worked for.
If one of these guys
shoots someone,
they're gonna
bring me down for it.
I'm not gonna do it.
I'll talk to him.
We need to close this deal.
We cannot stay like this
any longer.
We have to close
on that property.
We're so weak right now.
Why do you want this so badly?
Because I've got
my entire savings at risk
on this deposit...
No, no, no,
I don't mean the deposit.
I mean... this.
Why do you want it?
Have you ever thought about it?
I've thought about it every day
for the last five years.
That place has just been sitting
right across that fence
mocking me...
I'm not talking
about that place.
I-I just meant... everything.
Why do you want it so much?
I have no idea what you mean.
- Arthur.
- Anna.
You look as lovely as always.
- Thank you.
Gentlemen,
do you know Ian Thompson,
one of our new vps.
- Ian.
- Hello, Ian.
You're good?
Good.
Alright.
Hungry?
So, what can I
get you to drink?
A lot.
Wine list, please.
- I'll be right back.
So...
How are you?
We've been better,
but we're good.
Yes, I heard about that.
If you stay in business
long enough,
it's bound to happen eventually.
Well, that's exactly right,
Arthur.
That's why we wanted
to sit down with you tonight
and be up front about
everything that's going on.
Make sure you understand
the nature of the complaints
and that,
even in a worst case scenario,
we'll move forward with very
comfortable capital on hand.
Yes, but you should know,
Arthur,
that this man has been
digging through our industry
looking for anything
it can find for the last
two years now.
And the thought that
he would single us out,
it's ridiculous.
Thank you.
I run a fair
and clean business,
and we follow every
standard industry practice,
and I will fight till
my last breath to prove that.
But...
Don't think for a moment
that I'm gonna let this mess
interfere with our plans
to grow.
And we need to know
that you're standing with us.
Yes.
What is it about this property
that makes you feel
it's so integral?
That you can't put it off until
after all these legal matters
are settled?
That's a very good question.
This property gives us
many things.
First, access to the river,
so I can bring in
my fuel directly
from any provider
in the world
straight to my tanks.
Second, it has over ten million
gallons of storage capacity,
so I can buy in the summers,
when the price is low,
and sell to my customers,
and more importantly,
my competitors
when the price is high.
I will no longer
just drive trucks.
I will control my fate.
But the real answer
to your question
is that when it feels
scary to jump, Ian,
that is exactly when you jump.
Otherwise, you end up
staying in the same place
your whole life,
and that, I can't do.
We've always been there
with you,
and know
that we will continue to be.
Good.
- Thanks, Arthur.
I don't think we have to eat.
That went really good.
Arthur's a good man.
They're gonna close.
Of course.
Shit.
Are you okay?
Are you alright?
- Yeah.
What the fuck was that?
It was a deer.
- It's still alive.
- Shit.
You've gotta put it
out of its misery.
Jesus...
I mean it.
Can't leave it like that.
Goddammit.
Shit.
Is it dead?
No.
- Well, you need to...
- I know.
- What are you doing?
- I'm getting the tire iron.
Hi, Maria,
so sorry we're late.
The girls okay?
Oh, yes.
All is good.
You can go home now.
See you in the morning?
Okay.
- What?
- What?
Yeah... what?
Okay, Anna.
What's with the gun?
I told you.
I wasn't gonna continue
to stand around
and let these people come
and get me and my children.
Who seems to be completely
comfortable just standing around
like some fucking pussy,
I decided to do something
about it.
Where did you get it?
You know where I got it.
And do you have a permit?
Then you must be
a bigger fucking idiot
than I even thought.
You wanna protect
your children?
Protect them?
Do you have any idea
what happens to you
if they catch you
using that thing?
You dress yourself up
in these fancy clothes,
and look at you here
in your mansion.
I've given you everything
you could possibly ask for
and you still can't help acting
like the Brooklyn corner-store
gangster's daughter
that you are.
Are you delusional?
Do you really understand
how ridiculous that makes...
let me see this thing.
This... this...
You're gonna protect yourself
with this?
You know who uses guns
like these?
Whores!
You're walking us
right into a trap...
...and you can't even see it.
This is not allowed
in my fucking house.
Then you need to protect us.
That is what I'm doing.
One at a time.
Birthday girl first.
Can I speak to him, please?
Go somewhere else.
Guys, are you serious?
- We don't want any trouble.
We don't want any trouble here.
As you can see,
I'm in the middle of
my daughter's birthday party.
I understand that
and apologize, I do,
but this is a warrant
and we need to gain
complete access to the property.
What is this?
Let me check something.
Is he serious?
I'm gonna fucking
kill this guy.
Abel...
Give me five minutes.
Maria, keep the kids playing.
Mr. Lawrence, is it?
- Yes.
- Anna morales.
May I speak with you
for a minute?
I understand you and your men
have a job to do here,
but we're in the middle of
a ten-year-old's birthday party.
I understand and I'm sorry,
but we are coming in.
That's not a problem.
We have nothing to hide
from you.
It's just...
Well, we just moved
into the area and...
...I have 20 guests
inside my home...
Can you give me five minutes
so I can ask everyone
to leave calmly
before you guys
come into my house?
You can get 'em
out of the house.
Thank you.
Where are you putting them?
Oh, shit.
Alright, hand me those ones.
You have three minutes.
What's going on out there?
Our guests are leaving.
Jesus, Anna.
Why do we even
have to be doing this?
I don't want them
to go through these
before I have a chance to.
Go.
Get back in there.
¶ ¶
here you go.
Here you go.
Thank you.
One for you.
Thanks.
Excuse me, ma'am.
Here you go, sweetheart.
Can we get you
something to drink?
No, I'm good.
This is probably one
you're gonna regret.
Excuse me?
My husband's an honorable man.
We're not who you think we are.
I think I know your father.
Good for you.
My husband... is not my father.
Not even close.
So if I were you...
...I would start treating us
with a little more respect,
or I guarantee...
He will make it
his mission in life...
To ruin you.
This was very disrespectful.
And you're not gonna find
a fucking thing.
30 to 33 are just about
ready to go.
Six, what are you doing
back here?
Hey, how are you?
I'm good.
I'm a little bit nervous.
I'm heading out on
my first calls alone today.
You'll be great.
Just hold the eye contact
longer than you'd like.
You see what happens.
Good luck.
Hey.
- Hey.
Glad to see you back here.
You look good.
You ready to get back to work?
English.
I think so.
You are.
Where are you heading?
Uh, a bulk delivery to chase.
Manhattan.
It's a cakewalk.
I feel...
...vulnerable.
Good...
Because you are vulnerable.
We all are.
But to be successful...
...and great...
You must keep going back.
And I know what these guys
want to be doing,
but that doesn't make you
any safer.
Because then they'll
come back at us
with everything they have.
So this is what we do.
We keep going back.
And the times will get better.
We'll get safer.
We will.
So go.
You're strong just by going.
Stronger, in fact.
Thank you.
Mr. rose?
I'm Alex
with standard heating oil.
I was just about
to show your wife
the results of my inspection.
Should we head upstairs?
Run through some numbers?
Sure, I just had one question
about the exhaust chimney.
Would you be willing
to take a look?
Of course.
I'm gonna head up.
Can I get you
something to drink?
Coffee? Tea?
Tea would be great.
I'm a coffee man, myself.
Here you go.
So, uh, what exactly
was the problem...
Kathy.
Kathy! Kathy!
On the 59th street bridge!
Kathy?
Kathy, over.
They are coming again.
Help! Help!
- Help!
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
he's got a gun!
Fuck you!
Relax!
What are you doing?
Relax?
You fucking relax!
Look, look, you wanna do this?
You want me to fucking shoot?
You wanna kill someone?
Think about it!
Go back, you piece of shit!
Dan, you alright?!
- Yeah, I'm fine!
- He hit you?
No!
Where is he?
There's people out here!
You're gonna kill somebody!
You should have thought
about that before you came!
Jesus Christ!
Cops! Cops!
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
Back in the car and drive!
Aw, fuck.
I'm running.
Jesus.
Better run, cunt.
Get back in your car!
Oh, sh...
¶ ¶
Ah, there he is!
Had to be the hero, huh?!
Oh, fuck you.
Couldn't just let us
take the fucking truck?
Did they see you come in here?
I don't think so.
Did they or not?
Yes or not?
No!
There's a door down here,
about four more flights.
You come out under the bridge.
It's a park.
Fuck you!
You're welcome.
Kathy, it's me.
What are you talking about?
What shots?
Someone shot up his truck
on the 59th street bridge.
Can you give us a minute?
Please...
I heard.
We had nothing to do with this.
This is not the way
that I do business.
In fact I've been warning my
men against this very thing.
This is terrible for me.
It's not good for either of us.
I know.
In my job we use
whatever leverage we can gain,
as I'm sure you do
in your business.
This is
an ongoing investigation
and this incident will just
be one piece of many,
so as much as I appreciate
you coming here...
I have nothing I can tell you.
...fucking mess this is.
You knew where he is?
No.
When you do, bring him to us.
A situation like this
happening in such
a dangerous and public way
within an industry that
I'm charged with cleaning up
is very bad for me.
I'll find him.
Okay.
Abel.
Arthur.
I wanted to come
and talk to you in person.
We're not gonna be able
to show up for you on Thursday.
We can't do the loan.
I wanted to let you know
as soon as possible
so you could try to put
something else together.
Thank you for coming.
This is not right.
I know.
And you are aware of the
position this is putting me in?
I am.
Arthur,
I paid off my first loan
to you 11 years ago.
Do you remember the term
on that loan?
I don't.
I had five years
to pay you back.
Do you know how long it took me
to pay you off?
- Seven months.
- Six and a half.
I'm sorry.
I put 40 percent down deposit
on this property
because you said
that you would be there.
You now have three
serious separate pending
legal cases against you.
One with 16 counts
of misconduct
ranging from fraud
to tax evasion.
And then today,
in the middle of our meeting,
I get a report saying
you had armed your entire
fleet of drivers
which led to a shootout
on the 59th street bridge.
- None of that is true.
- That may be...
May?
It does't matter.
It does matter.
It matters that you know
we didn't do this.
I do.
I do.
But it doesn't matter.
I can't do anything.
I'm sorry.
I'll find it.
I know you will.
Come on.
It's horrible.
Yes.
Where is he?
We're looking for him.
Have they found
the other guys yet?
Of course not.
You okay?
No, I'm not okay.
They're out.
Who?
The bank.
What does that mean?
We find the money
somewhere else.
That's what it means.
We have two days.
No.
No.
Julian!
Julian, stop running!
Andrew, he's coming to you!
We got him!
¶ ¶
he's turning me in.
Of course we're turning you in.
You put everything
he's worked for
for the last 20 years at risk.
If it was up to me
we'd be doing this
in a very different way.
They said
you fired off four shots.
Is that right?
I don't know.
Where's the gun?
I, uh,
I threw it in the river.
Good.
When we did
our background check
it said you'd
never been arrested.
Is that true?
Why is this putting
everything at risk?
I asked you if you've
ever been arrested.
No.
Because no bank will touch us.
Because if he can't close
on that piece of property
then your buddy here
loses everything.
That's why.
Here.
This is an attorney
that'll meet you
at the station.
You no longer work for us.
You've been fired.
Abel would like
to pay for the lawyer.
Good luck.
I'm sorry.
I know.
I was scared.
Yeah, I know.
You don't get scared?
I've always been a lot more
afraid for failure
than of anything else.
It wasn't always like this.
I am sorry.
Good.
Okay.
I am not... I am not strong.
That doesn't have to be true.
- Listen to me.
Trust me.
Trust me.
I'm not...
- Oh, yeah.
That's enough.
¶ ¶
hey...
I am sorry.
He's running!
Officers in pursuit.
Suspect on foot!
¶ ¶
Thank you for seeing me.
Of course.
Actually, I think we have
met before, but...
I didn't realize that you
were Saul's granddaughter.
My grandfather didn't trust
any of his children
to run the business.
Yes.
I know that you tried to buy
the company from my grandfather
several times.
His goal was to stay healthy
long enough to be able
to give the company to me,
which he thankfully did.
So while I appreciate
your visit,
we are still not for sale.
I'm not here to offer
to buy your company.
- Oh.
- But as you will soon learn,
some years are good,
and others, not so.
I am under contract with
a significant hard deposit
at risk to purchase
the old bay front terminal.
- I see.
And...
Due to...
Circumstances
out of my control...
My bank has left me
at the altar.
So I'm here.
Hat in hand.
Looking for a loan.
I certainly expect the terms
to be in your favor.
But if your grandfather trusted
you with his company,
then I would be willing to
trust you as my lien holder.
How much?
I need
a million-and-a-half dollars.
Would you give us a minute?
Yes?
You can go back in.
We can offer you 500,000
at 20% for a year.
And we would need a five-year
straight wholesale
holding agreement
for 250,000 gallons a year
at your new facility.
Okay.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So uh, I should start by
thanking you for your
assistance in attempting
to bring in the driver.
Yeah, we didn't expect him
to react that way.
Yeah well, the officers there
didn't set it up very well on
their end, either.
I'm sorry.
Miss lange?
It has been brought to our
attention that it might be
beneficial on your end
to resolve this issue
in a time-sensitive way.
It's a possibility.
- So, we have prepared an offer
for you to review.
I'll present it to him.
That's good, Andrew.
Okay.
I need more time.
Hm.
Of course you do.
I know our agreement
doesn't allow for that.
But I need more time.
It is a difficult time
to do business.
- Yes, yes it is.
I um...
I'll give you three days.
But then, it's over.
Thank you.
Thank you, Joseph.
- You're welcome.
Abel, please sit down.
Andrew?
- Yes?
- How are you?
- Well.
Abel...
Stop.
Um...
Abel, we had a chance to meet
for a little bit
before you got here,
and...
Of course everyone in this room
is fully capable of lying
to their own mothers on their
deathbeds ,
but the conclusion that we've
come to... and I should say that
we feel fairly certain after
a very Frank conversation,
that the guys
who are doing this...
That they're not actually
working for anyone
in this room.
As you know, there are plenty
of other smaller providers
in the area that might have
something to do with it,
who are not here tonight.
Peter, thank you.
Thank you.
That may be true.
But over the last six months,
have been stolen from me
and my family.
Now the reason we asked bill
to get you all here,
is because...
The people at this table
are the only people
within two hundred Miles
of here that have the ability
to purchase and store
that kind of quantity.
So...
No matter what bullshit you've
been telling each other...
One of you...
Or two...
Or three...
Have been allowing this
to happen,
by buying it
from these cowards,
or worse yet,
hiring them to do it.
So, what I'm saying is: Stop.
Now.
Have some pride in what you do.
And stop.
Hi.
Hi.
How's it coming?
I got to 1975.
No?
How is it?
- Oh, I'm not sure yet.
But I don't think it's as bad
as they're saying it is.
'Cos I kinda knew
what I was doing.
How'd you do?
Got us three more days.
That's great.
I got a piece from Saul.
But we're still about
a million short.
Well, you're gonna go see
your little brother.
- First thing.
- And Peter.
- Probably.
How are the girls?
Feel like I haven't
seen them forever.
- They're fine.
I was putting them
to bed tonight...
I told them...
Their dad was out there...
Taking care of us.
I said that
whatever he wanted...
He was gonna get.
And that there was no man...
No man would ever stand
in his way.
This is all worth it.
- Of course.
- Hey...
Look at us.
It is.
- I know.
I know.
I didn't mean
to take you away.
We're done.
I didn't know you were coming.
Yeah, I didn't either.
You've grown.
You saw me a month ago.
I know, I know.
But you have.
Uh oh...
Jesus!
I don't know how you get
any work done around here.
I don't.
So...
I'm in a bit
of a rough patch here.
Yeah?
Yeah.
It happens.
I know.
Good.
I need your signature on this.
What is it?
It's a short term
mortgage...
On the apartment building
we own together.
That thing isn't worth more
than 150 grand though.
It's 210.
Uh-huh...
Since when do you...
Need to take out
sucker mortgages for 200 grand?
I'm up against it here.
Thank you.
It's good to see
your face.
I love you.
tank a?
Kathy.
What's going on?
Where are you?
Uh, hall street
and flushing Avenue.
I'm right here.
I'll see if I can find you.
Abel, Abel!
That way!
Shit...
B train to the Bronx.
Next stop, 50th street.
Next stop, 50th street.
Doors open on the right.
Oh!
Who hired you?
Who do you work for?
Hey!
Listen to me!
Your friend is dead!
Who hired you?!
Please...
Please.
Please, please.
Please!
Go!
Get outta here.
Thank you.
I don't work for anybody!
But I sold a load of your fuel
in far rockaway... Last week!
Hey!
Jimmy, could you
give us a minute?
Yeah, sure.
Abel!
That was well-said last night.
Thank you.
What can I do for you?
I'm just here to collect that
check that you owe me.
What check is that?
The one for $213,000.
That funny?
A little.
- Why's that?
'Cause I don't know what the
fuck you're talking about.
That's how much has
been taken from me
over the last six months.
I had nothing to do with that.
No?
Your far rockaway facility
bought a load of fuel...
Off of one of my
stolen trucks last week.
That's not possible.
Arnold...
I was standing on one
of my hijacked trucks
a couple weeks ago just...
Thinking about the cowards
that have done this.
When I remembered...
That load was purchased
off a barge...
From Texas.
Now, as you know,
Texas #4 is marked.
Do you have any receipts
over the last year
for incoming mark #4?
So, I'm guessing
there's at least, what?
in your small tank right now.
How much?
I said...
I need a day.
Okay.
But, I was just buying
the stuff off these guys.
I only bought
a couple loads.
I don't know who they are!
I would never do that!
This may ruin me.
My goal was to have you
out of business by the end
of next year.
But if you're
this fucking desperate,
I imagine it won't even
take that long.
Makes you miss having
your dad around, doesn't it?
Abel!
I wasn't the only person
buying this shit!
Alright, well when you
find out who else did it,
you can have them
pay the difference.
But I need the whole lot
by tomorrow morning,
or you're gonna have the feds
at your doorstep by noon.
There he is!
The caped-crusader!
Come on up.
You all right?
Yeah.
Thank you for seeing me.
Of course.
So what is it?
I need a loan.
You don't wanna do that.
Yeah, no shit.
But I'm here.
What are we talking about?
$600,000.
-
Jesus, Abel...
Abel, that's a problem.
Yeah...
But if I don't get it...
What's my collateral?
The terminal.
Oh yeah?
Me and how many other people
are gonna be coming after it.
No way.
Peter...
You'll get your money.
You know, Abel, I respect
everything that you've done.
And because of it, we haven't
come after you the way I should
have for coming into my service
area and poaching my customers.
You're good at what you do,
probably better than us,
and I accept that.
But this would be different.
I don't want you to be
in this position.
We are not nice people
to borrow three quarters
of million dollars from.
I know that.
You know, I'm gonna
think about this.
Yeah, we should both
think about this.
Yeah?
What a day.
- Yeah.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
- How's your brother?
- He's good.
He's good.
The girls up there, thought...
- stop.
I tell you, they didn't have
girls like that where
I went to school.
Shut your mouth.
How'd it go?
I think we can pull it off.
Yeah?
- Yeah.
Three different parties.
It's a mess.
And the terms...
Peter finally showed me
his true colors.
I'm sorry.
Spent my whole life trying not
to become a gangster.
I know.
And now, on the biggest deal
of my career,
they're gonna own me.
What is this?
Bank account.
Whose?
Ours.
Ours?
How much is in it?
A lot.
This'll help.
You replace Peter's money.
Get him outta the deal.
Where did this come from?
Abel...
Where did this come from?!
I've been skimming money
from the company.
Anna...
How long?!
From the beginning.
It was just in case
times got tough.
But then it was because
you were taking all these
crazy chances!
I didn't know what else to do.
I couldn't risk us
being left with nothin'.
What am I supposed to do
with this?
Use it.
Is it clean?
I don't know what that means.
It means that if I were to walk
into the office of the people
that are trying to put us
in jail right now
and if I slapped a check from
this account on their desk,
would it push me
deeper into hell
or would it help
to pull me out?!
That's what it means!
It's as clean as every dollar
we've ever made.
Well, that's a fucking
bullshit answer!
I can clear it in the books.
- I don't want anything to do
with this!
Fine...
You keep it exactly
where it is, alright?!
And you use it when they drag
me off to jail!
So, what's the plan here?!
I'm gonna get this done,
and it's not gonna be
as a cheat.
God, you're too much!
You've been walking around
your whole life,
like all this happened
'cos of your hard work,
your good luck, your charm.
Mr. fucking American dream.
It wasn't your good luck
helping you out all these
years, it was me!
Doing the things you didn't
want to know about!
- You stole from me!!
You've been so go at not
letting your ego get in the way
when it comes to business.
Don't start now 'cos it's me.
We'll use the money...
Your money.
It's the smart play.
It's our money.
I know.
Good?
Pen, please.
These fucking guys...
What's the extra 11 thou?
There's some fuel left over
in two of the tanks.
It was a fair price for it.
Mazel tov.
Thank you.
Congratulations.
Did you know...
About the money?
Yes.
You shoulda told me.
I know.
I'm sorry!
Take a look at this.
You know something?
I never realized...
We had this view
from back here.
I did.
It's beautiful.
Abel!
Que, huh?
I thought you said you
threw that in the river.
- Well, I didn't.
- Yeah, I can see that.
I have nowhere to go.
Nowhere easy.
Fuck you.
Fuck you.
-
I have nothing.
I have nothing.
And somehow you've ended up
with everything you wanted!
It wasn't meant to be.
What is that supposed to mean?!
- I know what you wanted.
I know...
But you have to
forget that now.
You gave me a good chance.
You gave me a good chance,
correct?
Hm?
Yes.
You give me a better chance
than I deserved.
-
Right?
No.
You're looking backwards.
Look forwards, that's the only
thing you can control.
God!
Whoo!
Abel!
Please...
Take care of my family.
Call the police.
Mr. morales.
I'm very sorry.
You knew him well?
- Yes, I did.
He must have been under
a hell of a lot of pressure.
Yes, he was.
I'm sorry.
Well, thank you for coming.
I just wanted to make sure that
all this was handled correctly.
- Of course.
So...
You should know that I won't
be taking that deal
that you offered.
I would never accept
felony charges for anything
that we've done.
I know.
I'm not a felon.
That's probably true.
But I also can't have you
digging around in my life
for the next ten years,
hanging this around my neck.
Look, I love a good battle...
But this is very bad
for my business.
So we need to come to some
sort of conclusion.
We can probably do that.
Good.
So, I hear you closed
on this terminal today.
Yeah, it looks that way.
I didn't realize this is what
you had in the works.
Yeah, for a very long time.
This could put you in quite
a powerful position.
I mean, you get this place
up and running,
it'll have
significant influence...
Politically speaking.
We all have our ambitions,
Abel.
Sometimes we need help
to get there.
Yes.
You've come a very long way...
In a very short time.
Well, it doesn't feel that way.
But you should know that I have
always taken the path
that is most right.
The most right?
The result...
Is never in question for me.
Just what path do you take
to get there.
And there is always one
that is most right.
And that is what this is.
I hope so.
