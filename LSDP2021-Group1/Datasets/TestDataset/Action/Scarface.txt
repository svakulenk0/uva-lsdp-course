...
I say, what are we gonna do
with the South Side?
Let some of the other boys
get theirs too.
I got all I want.
Johnny Lovo,
he's talkin' about
starting something.
Yeah? He's lookin'
for trouble, eh?
Johnny's very foolish.
Look at me.
A man always gotta know
whether he's got it or not.
I got plenty.
I got house.
I got automobile.
I got nice girl.
I got stomach trouble too.
Better get
some sleep here.
All right, boys.
Well, she was a pretty
good party, eh?
Next week, I'm going
to give a party...
which the boys have never
seen nothing like it before.
We'll have much more music,
much more girls,
much more everything.
Everybody should say,
"Ah! Big Louie, he sit
on top of the world!" Eh?
Good-bye, Louie.
Good-bye, boys.
Take-a good "careful"
of yourself, eh?
I see you some more.
Hello. I want
Lakeside 417, please.
Yeah. 417 Lakeside.
Sure.
...
Hello, Louie.
All right.
That's rotten!
"Costillo Slaying
Starts Gang War."
That's what I want.
I'm workin' on
that angle now.
Four? You'll need 40 men
on this story...
for the next five years.
You know what's happening?
This town is up for the grabs.
Get me?
You know, Costillo was
the last of the old-fashioned
gang leaders.
There's a new crew coming out,
and every guy that's got
money enough to buy a gun...
is gonna try to step
into his place.
You see? They'll be shooting
each other like rabbits for the
control of the booze business.
You get it?
It'll be just like war.
That's it... war.
You put that in the lead.
War. "Gang war."
Here come the coppers.
Hello, Rinaldo.
You coming along?
Where's Camonte?
Hello, Guarino.
What's your hurry?
I'm gettin' a massage too.
We'll finish that
at headquarters.
Put your coat on.
I got lotsa time.
Who wants to see me?
The chief.
That kidney foot?
Never mind the jokes.
Come on.
Hey, how's it look
in the back? Hmm?
Mmm.
Come on, you rat!
Come on!
"Tony Camonte,
alias... Joe Black.
"Assault, carrying
brass knuckles and sap,
DW, disturbing peace,
"street robbery on three counts,
loft burglary,
violation Volstead Act.
"Member Five Points Gang.
Came from New York, 1920.
At present,
bodyguard and strong arm
for Louie Costillo."
Bodyguard for Costillo, eh?
Pretty smart boy.
Who, me?
That's very funny.
Big Louie and me,
we're like this.
Can I slap it out of him,
Chief?
This fella got ideas
I don't like.
Costillo hired you
for a bodyguard.
Where were you at the shootin'?
I was havin'
my beauty sleep.
In a lady's house.
You want her name?
Phone number?
- She's very nice.
- We'll go into your alibis later.
You been hangin' around
Johnny Lovo, haven't you?
Lovo split with Big Louie.
What are you doing
at Lovo's house last week?
Now, listen, Tony.
I'm gonna give you a chance.
You play ball with me,
and I'll play ball with you.
Last night, you metJohnny
in Spinelli's Barber Shop.
What'd he give you money for?
Now, listen, you.
What kinda mug
you think I am?
I don't know nothin',
I don't see nothin'
and I don't hear nothin'.
And when I do,
I don't tell a cop.
- You understand?
- All right, Guarino, you can have him.
Thanks.
Come on, Tony.
We'll take a look
at the goldfish.
Here's Epstein.
Hi, boys.
Hello, Chief.
All right,
let's have it.
Writ of habeas corpus for
the release ofTony Camonte
and Guino Rinaldo.
Who gave it to you?
Flemming.
All right, gentlemen,
see ya later.
Hey, I-I don't go
with this guy?
You think you're gonna
get there with a gun,
but you're not. Get me?
You know why? Because you
got $1,000 bills pasted
right across your eyes.
And someday you're gonna
stumble and fall down
in the gutter,
right where the horses
have been standin'...
right where you belong.
Hmm. You've got me
all figured out, huh?
I've spent my life
mixin' with your breed,
and I don't like it. Get me?
You can hide behind
a lot of red tape,
crooked lawyers,
politicians with the "gimmes,"
writs of habeas corpus,
witnesses that don't remember,
but we'll get through to you
just like we got all the rest.
Oh, maybe me,
I'm different.
No, you're not.
Take your gun away
and get you in a tough spot,
and you'll squeal...
like all the other rats.
You're gonna get me,
eh?
In your particular case,
I'd give up a month's pay
for the job.
Are you gonna see Lovo?
Yeah. Right away.
Tell him to stay
under cover.
I'll come up tomorrow.
Hey, what's this writ
you got me out on?
Habeas corpus..." deliver
the body." Can't hold you
without booking you.
No matter what
they think you've done.
That's a fine idea.
You tell Flemming
I want lots of them.
Hi, boss.
Come in, Tony.
Glad to see ya.
Hey. That's
pretty hot.
Silk.
Expensive, huh?
I see that Epstein
got to you in time.
Yeah.
He's a nice little fella.
They give him a writ
of hocus pocus.
Sit down.
Thanks.
He said, " You stay here
till the heat's off."
He said...
Hey. That's pretty hot.
That's Poppy.
Hey, Poppy.
Meet Tony Camonte.
Hi.
Mm-hmm.
How are the coppers taking it?
Huh? Oh, I didn't pay
much attention.
What about
the newspapers?
Yeah. I bring 'em along.
The  has got
the best story.
Pictures of you
and one of me too.
Huh! Where'd they run it,
in the razor ads?
Huh? Oh, that.
That's an old business.
You'll get used to that.
War... with a blond
in a Brooklyn speakeasy.
Some kidder, huh?
It takes a long time
with the pincher's, huh?
You've got an office for this
sort of thing, Johnny.
Why don't you use it?
There you are, Tony.
That's a bonus.
Hey, that's a nice feel.
That was a fine job, Tony.
Remember,
that's only chicken feed.
You've stepped into big company.
You stick to me and do
what I say, play square,
you'll be walkin' around
with lace pants and a gold hat.
You know what I mean?
Sure, I know.
Now, listen, I'm gonna
cut you in on a percentage.
Give you a raise... double.
The South Side is rollin'
in jack. All we gotta do
is step in and take it.
Yeah, and have some fun
with O'Hara too, huh?
Who? Now wait a minute.
O'Hara's too big a guy
to buck now.
There's lots of jack
on the North Side.
Now listen, you.
You let me think up the ideas.
I'll take care
of that big hop in my own way
when the time comes.
I say we stay out
of the North Side.
I say we leave O'Hara alone.
And what I say goes.
Don't ever forget that.
You're the boss.
That's better.
From now on, next to me,
the boys take orders
from you.
Yeah, me and you, huh?
That's fine talk, boss.
Here. Have a cigar.
There'll be plenty of work
for everybody.
Costillo slowed down
too much.
Yeah.
And now he come
to a dead stop.
Here. You'd better
smoke one of mine.
Mmm.
That's pretty nice.
Expensive, huh?
I don't like cigar smoke
in my room. Do you mind?
Listen, I'm gonna hold off
that meeting with the boys
a couple of days.
After Big Louie's funeral,
it's better.
You know what I mean?
Hmm? Oh, yeah. Sure, sure.
It don't look so good.
And I want you to send some
flowers... a cross of white
carnations from me, see?
Yeah, and I send
lotsa purple bunch.
Big Louie, he always
liked purple.
Why don't you go
and do it now?
You'd better
make that meetin' Monday.
Tell all the guys
that want to run beer
on the South Side to be there.
Tell 'em I'm gonna make
a speech. Know what I mean?
Mm-hmm.
Well, good-bye, Poppy.
See ya again.
She don't like
anybody but me.
Mm-hmm.
She's a very busy girl.
Expensive, huh?
Here you are, Little Boy.
Easy dough, huh,
for just standing outside
and listenin' to a gun go off?
Cinch. When are we
gonna get some more?
We'll get plenty.
There's business just waitin'
for some guy to come
and run it right.
And I got ideas.
We're workin' for Lovo,
ain't we?
Lovo. Who's Lovo? Just some guy
who's a little bit more smart
than Big Louie. That's all.
Hey, that guy is soft.
I could just see it
in his face.
He's got a setup, that's all,
and we gotta wait.
Someday I'm gonna run
the whole works.
Yeah? Remember, those
monkeys on the North Side
ain't so soft.
Oh, yeah? Say,
they're satisfied,
ain't they?
Why didn't they come
and take Big Louie
before we did?
Listen, Little Boy.
In this business, there's only
one law you gotta follow
to keep outta trouble.
Do it first,
do it yourself
and keep on doin' it.
Mmm!
Where's Cesca?
Oh, I don't know.
She go out.
What do you mean?
Ain't she comin' home
for dinner?
Oh.
Hey, I don't like that.
You tell her I want she should
come home for dinner.
Sure. I tell her
lotsa time.
"Come home. Come home.
Tony no like."
But she don't...
That's a nice way
I catch ya, huh?
What do you mean, "catch me"?
I wasn't doin' nothin'.
You was kissin' him.
Sure. What of it?
Well, I don't like it.
You're missin' lots of fun.
Listen, I don't want anyone
kissin' my sister. Understand?
You're hurtin' my arm!
I don't want anybody
puttin' their hands on you!
What do you think
doing?
I'm your brother.
You don't act it.
You act more like...
I don't know.
Sometimes I think...
I don't care what you think.
You do what I say.
Sure, and never have any fun.
Oh, "never have any fun."
You call that fun, huh?
Runnin' around with
guys like that.
That's "fun."
Listen, you want
real fun, huh?
Here. How's that?
Gee, Tony! Where'd you get it?
Never mind where I got it.
You just spend it, see?
Go on.
Get ready for dinner.
And remember,
you do what I say.
What for you wanna
give her money, huh?
Ma, she's just a kid.
She wants to have fun.
Yeah? Sometime,
I think you crazy.
Cesca!
What for you take
that money, huh?
Because I want it. That's why.
Give it back.
It's bad money.
Tony no got it
in no good way. It gonna
bring you lotsa trouble.
What do I care where he gets it?
There's nothing wrong
with his giving it to me.
Tony wants me
to have a good time.
Oh, yes? You listen!
Tony no love you
like he make you believe.
All the time,
he smile on top,
but what he thinks...
Oh, he's got lotsa tricks.
He no give money
to nobody for nothing.
He would to his sister.
Sister. Huh!
That make no difference.
To him, you're just
another girl.
Someday when he need you,
he mix you up
in his business...
just like anyone else,
and he's gonna make you
bad like him.
He can't make me do
anything I don't want to.
I'm gonna live my own life.
I can take care of myself.
Yeah? All the time,
Tony say like that.
Afterward, he no
belong to me no more.
He's-a no good,
and now you start to be
just like him.
No, I'm not.
Don't worry about me.
I'll get along
all right.
Hey.
Thank you.
Thank you.
That's all right, boys.
Just changin' the name
on the door.
Meet the new president...
Johnny Lovo.
Hiya, boys.
Where's Berdini,
Zeigler, Meehan?
Anybody see 'em?
They ain't comin'.
- They said you could take a flyin'...
- Okay, okay.
Now we know
where they stand.
All right, you guys,
I'm makin' a speech.
Here it is.
Big Louie gets a wad of dough,
and then he gets soft.
He lets you guys come
into the South Side and run beer.
Well, I'm gonna change it, see?
You can still stay in,
Are you askin' us
or telling us?
I'm tellin' ya.
We're gonna get organized,
and I'm gonna handle the works.
- You got somethin'
figured out, Johnny?
- Everything.
Not being able to get it's
gonna make this town
thirstier than ever.
Runnin' beer ain't a nickel game
anymore. It's a business. I'm
gonna run it like a business.
Swell. We've been cuttin'
each other's throats
long enough.
There are 3,000 saloons on the
South Side... half a million
customers. Figure that out.
- So you're going to be it.
- Yeah,  That's me.
I make my own beer,
and I got my own trucks.
I don't have to go
into business with nobody.
Where you goin'?
Who wants to know?
You sit down here,
and don't interrupt
the president no more.
All right, President.
Well, are the rest
of you guys in or out?
- What about Meehan?
- Yeah. Berdini and Zeigler?
Why, they been sellin'
to 700, 800 joints
between them.
Yeah? Well,
from now on, they're out.
Those joints buy from us.
Sure. If you try to sell
at one of those places,
Meehan'll turn
this side of the town
into a shootin' gallery.
Fine. Anything he starts,
we'll finish.
You guys don't have to worry.
All you gotta do
is to haul beer.
Yeah? Well, who's gonna
stick his neck in those joints
to get the orders?
- My friend Tony Camonte.
- Yeah. I'm what he call
"a good salesman."
Hey, I start right now
to get orders, hey, boss?
All you can get.
Go to it.
Hey.
Dope, got a pencil?
Oh, boys, I don't write.
That's one.
Come on.
Come on, Little Boy.
Business.
Here, have your beer.
Hey! What is this?
Let go of me, will ya?
What do ya want?
Let go of me.
Let go!
What's the idea?
Come on.
Say, what's the big idea?
Sit down.
Who you buyin'
your beer from?
Meehan and Berdini.
How many barrels
a day?
Three.
He's lyin', Tony.
He's been takin' five.
Chiseler. Well, you're
gettin' eight now, see?
And you're buyin'
from us... Johnny Lovo.
But, listen...
Sit down.
I can't use eight
barrels around here.
I'll get ya
a hunk of soap.
You take a bath in it.
What are you payin'
a barrel?
Fifty.
Well, ours is 65.
It's better.
You get delivery tomorrow.
What am I gonna tell
Meehan and Berdini?
We'll take care of them.
Don't worry.
Well, that's
order number one.
Now we get plenty more.
There's a system
to these things.
Well, you're gettin' 10.
You're gettin' a delivery
tomorrow.
There's no use
arguin' with this joint.
Zeigler runs it himself.
Step on it!
Hi, boss.
Mm! Lotsa garlic.
Get me some too.
Well, how's business?
You get some more orders?
Lotsa orders.
They all buy from us.
All we have to do is fill 'em.
Yeah. That's a good idea.
You better tell
Meehan and Berdini.
Oh, them fellas, they
retired from business.
What have you been doin'?
You remember you say all
they have to do is start
something, we finish it?
Well, did ya?
About an hour ago.
Hey! Hey, kid.
Come here.
Extra here!
Hey! Keep the change.
All right. Thanks.
Here you are, boss.
There's your South Side,
all nailed up in a box.
All nailed up in...
Yeah, well, you didn't
get the lid on very tight.
What do you mean?
Look at that.
Come on. Hey, keep this hot.
We'll be back for it.
This is a private
hospital! You can't...
Oh!
Oh! What
did they do?
Hiya, Poppy.
Hello.
Hey, what's all the time
bitin' you?
You afraid of me?
Well, that outfit's enough
to give anybody the yips.
Nice, huh?
I got three more...
different colors.
I see you're goin' in
for jewelry. It's kind of
effeminate, isn't it?
Huh? Yeah.
I got 'em at an auction.
A bargain.
You sure are
a funny mixture, Tony.
That's the first time
you smiled.
Yeah?
Well, how do you mean
you think I'm funny?
You just are. That's all.
What else are you doing
with all your money?
I hear you're gettin'
a new car.
Mm-hmm. It's different.
It's got bullet-proof glass
and a steel body.
And I got myself
a new house too.
Come up sometime?
Yeah. I'll bring
my grandmother.
No kiddin. You come up?
Why don't you get
yourself a girl, Tony?
I'm workin' on that now.
Yeah? Well, don't
tire yourself out.
Is Johnny in?
Yeah.
He's mad, huh?
Hiya, boss.
When are you gonna learn
that I am the boss?
Sure, you're the boss.
Then what do you mean
by breaking up that
Lakeview joint last night?
Didn't I tell you to stay
out of the North Side?
Listen, Johnny, it was easy.
You listen to me, stupid.
That was one of O'Hara's
places, and you know it.
Didn't I tell you
I wasn't ready
for O'Hara yet?
It was a nice little order...
I don't care if it's 50 a day.
What do you use
to think with,
an empty beer keg?
Just when we get
this territory lined up
and runnin' smooth,
you step out
and gum up the parade.
How do you mean, Johnny?
I just sell
a little more beer.
Aw, don't worry.
Don't worry?
You know what O'Hara's
liable to do now?
He'll send his guns down here
on the South Side. They'll
move around like hummingbirds.
You're liable to get it,
and I'm liable to get it.
He's tough.
Aw, he ain't so tough...
hangin' out in a flower shop.
- You afraid of a guy like that?
- I ain't afraid of anybody.
Sure, you're not.
That's a crazy question,
hey, Johnny?
Come on. Don't argue.
Where you goin'?
To clean up after you, you mug,
unless it's too late.
Look out!
Hello. Hello?
Hel... Hello.
Hello. This Mr. Camonte's
secretary.
What's the name, please?
This Mr. Camonte's
secretary.
Hey, hey, hey.

Oh. Okay, boss.

talkin' on Mr. Camonte. That's my boss.
That's...
Hey, hey.
Get a name.

No, no. I don't wanna know
what's your brother's name.
I wanna know
what's  name.
Oh, you do, huh?
Listen, I come on over there,
I smack you right in the teeth.
I get you, your brother...
Hey! What's-a matter?
That's no way to talk.
Talk nice.
Tell him to state
his business.
Go state your business!
Who was it?
- I don't know.
- What do you mean,
"I don't know"?
Didn't I tell you always
to get a name and write
it down over here?
Oh, boss, I forget again.
You forget again.
Hey, what are you
writin' there, huh?
I don't know.
I can't write.
Can't write?
That's nice... a secretary
that can't write.
A secretary
must be able to write,
must be educated.
Get an education.
Can't write.
Education?
That's your fault.
This Mr. Camonte's sec...
Oh, no. Please, you're wrong.
I no hang up on you.
I thought you was through.
I told you before.
You have to write a letter.
You have to make...
Oh, you do, huh?
Let me tell you...
Aw, shut up, you! You...
Hey, what's
the matter with you?
You crazy? Listen,
the last time I tell you...
You pick yourself
a nice one.
You get one for me?
Didn't have time.
Was there any trouble?
Naw. It was easy.
How many was there?
He was alone.
Hey.
Hello. Who is it?
I'm so...
I don't get...
Boss, I don't get the name.
Hello. Yeah? Who?
Oh, sure.
Sure. Send her right up.
That's Poppy.
Hey. Better nobody
see you with this.
Hello, handsome.
Well, Poppy.
Hello, Tony.
They tell me O'Hara was
killed in his flower shop
this morning.
Had you heard that?
Did Johnny
send you up here?
Johnny?
How do you
like this place?
Kind of gaudy,
isn't it?
Ain't it though?
I'm glad you like it.
Come here. I'll show you
something nice.
Steel shutters...
on all the windows.
It's my own idea.
In case you have visitors
you don't like, huh?
Uh-huh. That's right.
How do you...
How do you like
the view here, huh?
You see that?
Someday I look
at that sign and I say,
"Okay, she's mine."
You think so?
I got
a"purtty" good idea.
That's-a "purtty" hot.
Expensive, eh?
Yeah. Come here.
I'll show you somethin'
what's "purtty" hot.
How do you like
this place, huh?
Come here.
Here's some stuff
I buy.
Mm, aren't they sweet?
Huh?
You like? I'm gonna
get some ties
made to match.
See, what I'm gonna do
is wear a shirt
only once.
Then I give it right away
to the laundry.
A new shirt every day.
Tsk. You're just gonna
drive the women mad, aren't you?
Yeah.
One of them.
Meaning me, I suppose.
Look at this.
Huh? It's got
inside springs.
I bought it
at an auction.
It's a buy.
Go ahead, sit down.
Try it.
Yeah. It's all right.
You like it?
Hmm?
I thought you were
Johnny's friend.
Sure. I likeJohnny,
but I like you more.
boss.
Cops is downstairs.
All right. Tell 'em
to come in and sit down.
I'll be right out.
Okay.
Hey, I... I don't wanna
be caught here.
This is a mess.
It's all right.
Don't get excited.
It's easy.
Oh, great. Thanks.
Hey, Poppy.
After I get through with 'em,
I'll meet ya at the restaurant...
on Fourth Street.
Yeah, all right.
Hey. Hey,
go to the left.
Uh-huh.
Hello, Guarino.
Hello.
You all alone?
Yeah.
Ah, you're a cute
fella comin' here
all by yourself.
You ain't
afraid of me, huh?
No, nor 10 like ya.
Come on.
The chief s waiting.
Hey, Angelo.
Call up Epstein
and tell him that...
Naw. Hey, Little Boy,
call up Epstein.
Tell him that kidney foot
here is taking me down
to the chief s office.
Let him come right down
with "habus corpis."
Understand?
Hey, you know, I just hear
O'Hara, he was-a met with
a terrible accident.
That's too bad, you know?
Yeah?
Yeah.
Come on, come on.
So Camonte thinks
he's gonna run
this side of town,
now that he's got O'Hara.
Yeah?
He won't get
any bigger.
We'll take him
before he finds out
about these guns.
Get the rest of them
unpacked.
How many we got?
Plenty. And there's
a lot more coming.
O'Hara had them run in
across the line last night.
We'll have the cops
on our necks.
Forget it.
They can't do
anything about it.
There's no law against
bringing guns into the state,
and we can buy
all we want.
What a cinch.
You said it.
Gaffney, listen.
Camonte just left
headquarters.
McGill's trailing him.
He's gonna phone.
Hey, you guys.
Load those guns.
You get the cars ready.
Stick the hearse
in front of'em.
Then to the South Side,
and I want everybody.
You hang on to that phone.
Right.
Snap into it now.
Get going.
Hello.
Hello, Tony.
Have a seat.
Hello.
Well, what took you
so long?
Eh, the moxie,
he was late with
the "ibious corpse."
Go on, order some food,
will ya? I'm hungry.
You know,
every time I see you,
you look better.
That's a cute hat.
Please! My stockings.
What's the matter?
Don't do that, Tony.
They're brand-new.
Hands off, huh?
No. Feet.
You know,
I know lotsa girls.
Uh, redheads
and blondes...
all kinds.
They all like me.
Yeah. You're pretty good, eh?
I'm the best.
Are you gonna eat,
by any chance?
I'm not hungry,
except for you.
You got somethin'
I like.
Yeah. I'm nice
with a lot of dressing.
You work fast, don't you, Tony?
No. Say, I've been
waitin' a long time.
I'm crazy for you.
Everybody say,
"Tony Camonte,
he's a big shot.
He's got everything
he wants."
Yeah. I got everything
what I want.
You understand?
Pardon me. Telephone
for Mr. Camonte.
Hey, dope,
go see who it is.
And get a name.
Hello. This Mr. Camonte's
secretary.
What's your name?
I say what's your name?
This Mr. Camonte's
secretary.
You have to speak louder.
I can't hear what you say.
That's too loud.
That's too loud.
Talk "lowler."
Hello. Please.
Don't be a fool, Tony!
What's the name, please?
I can't... Hello?
Hello. Please,
I can't hear what you say.
Hey! That's O'Hara's mob.
I can't hear what...
I can't...
I can't hear
what you say.
It's too loud.
Hey, lookit!
They got machine guns
you can carry.
If I had some of them, I could
run the whole works in a month.
I'll get you one
in a minute.
Hey, that's swell!
Look, it's little.
You can carry it.
Come on.
Let's get outta here.
Boss, there was too much noise.
I didn't get their name.
That's a dope!
Take him upstairs!
Take him upstairs!
That's all right.
The back door!
The back door!
Hey, lookit.
They've been here too.
Hey, look at that.
Come here.
Get me some shells.
Let's see if she works.
...
Hey, Johnny.
Look what I got.
You dirty murderin' mug!
You bumped off O'Hara.
Who, me? That's foolish.
You told me to stay out
of the North Side.
I stay out.
I've been home all day,
hey, Little Boy?
Sure.
Sure.
Oh, so that's it?
I told you to lay off.
I don't hear so good
sometimes.
You won't be hearing anything
if you go on like this.
Look. They clipped me.
Lookit, Johnny.
You can carry it around
like a baby.
What do ya mean?
We don't give 'em time.
We throw them Micks
up for grabs.
Yeah, well, when you're
laying in an alley
with your head blown off,
maybe you'll learn
how this business
oughta be run.
Yeah? And who's
gonna do that?
Gaffney, he's runnin' it now.
He'll give it to you here... a
pound of hot lead in the belly.
Make sure it's him,
Johnny.
Okay. Hey, Little Boy,
it's business. You fix
who goes in each car.
Where do you think you're going?
To the North Side.
You can't do that?
What do you mean, can't?
Who's stoppin' me?
I am. I'm givin' you orders
for the last time.
There's only one thing that
gets orders and gives orders,
and this is it.
That's how I got the South Side,
and that's how I'm gonna
get the North Side.
Some little typewriter, huh?
I'm gonna write my name
all over this town with it.
In big letters!
Hey, stop him, somebody!
Get outta my way, Johnny!
I'm gonna spit!
Come on, fellas!
Hey, Tony.
Take this along in case
that bean shooter
doesn't work.
Okay!
Come on, Dugan.
All right, come on!
Hey, you see what
happened here, kid?
I don't know, mister.
It was a big, black car
with side curtains,
and a machine gun
gave 'em the works.
Oh, hello, Ben.
What can we do? There's no law
against manufacturing them,
just against having them.
If they can't get 'em in one
state, they go across the border
and get 'em in another.
These fellas
bootleg machine guns
like they bootleg booze.
Yeah. They better do
something about that.
Because with these toys to play
with, what happened before
will look like a tea party.
I know it. Say, you better
put the screws on that
I hear they're
bringing 'em in
in fruit boxes.
Right.
Get that guy's number!
Somebody get an ambulance!
What's the matter?
Here's Gaffney.
Gaffney, what do you
know about this? Well?
Well, I was on my way
here to the garage
to keep an appointment.
I was late.
Yeah?
And a car drives up
and some guys pile out.
Two of'em was cops...
at least they was dressed
like cops.
Cops. That's a new gag.
Then what?
Well, it looked like a pinch,
so I beat it around the block.
Then he picked me up.
Yeah, lucky you were late.
Now take a good peek
and see what you missed.
Gangway here.
Keep it clear.
Seven of'em...
lined up against a wall.
Mowed down,
just like that!
Didn't have a chance!
Sit down, Chief.
You're wearin' out the carpet.
Yeah? I'm
the only one left.
Thinks he'll get me, huh?
Fat chance!
Who's there?
Journal.
Let him in.
Hi, Gaffney.
How'd you find me?
Oh, we boys from the
always get around.
Yeah? Anybody else
know I'm here?
Nope. Just my own idea.
Sit down. You're
gonna stay for a while.
Well?
Can't get a thing on him.
We're right up a blind alley
wherever we go.
And Gaffney's turned yellow.
He's hiding out.
What about Lovo?
Lovo is practically out.
He's as scared as Gaffney.
It's Camonte, all right,
but we can't prove it yet.
No, but we will.
Hey, Chief.
What do you want?
This fellow Camonte.
What about him?
Public's interested in him.
He's a colorful character.
Colorful? What color
is a crawling louse?
Listen, that's the attitude
of too many morons in this country.
They think these big hoodlums
are some sort of demigods.
What do they do
about a guy like Camonte?
They sentimentalize, romance,
make jokes about him.
They had some excuse for glorifying
our old western bad men.
They met in the middle
of the street at high noon and
waited for each other to draw.
But these things sneak up,
shoot a guy in the back
and then run away.
Colorful!
Did you read what happened?
A carful of'em chased another
down the street, broad daylight.
Three kiddies playing hopscotch
get lead poured in their little bellies.
When I think what goes on in the minds
of these lice, I want to vomit.
Ben?
Yeah?
See if you can find Gaffney.
He'll probably get it next.
They got all the others.
Right.
yet you keep right on
playing up his activities
as front-page news.
Murders, gang war, killing!
That's all we read about!
You're glorifying the gangster
by giving him this publicity.
You're trying to tell me
you can get rid of the gangster
by ignoring him?
By keeping him
off the front page?
That's ridiculous!
You're playing
right into his hands!
Show him up! Run him
out of the country! That'll
keep him off the front page.
In the meantime, you expect
our children to read of nothing
but outrage and murder?
That's better than
they're being slaughtered.
The city is full
of machine guns,
gang war in the streets.
Kids aren't even safe
to go to school.
Certainly not.
But what can private
citizens do?
Even our police force
can't stop it.
Don't blame the police.
They can't stop machine guns
from being run back and forth
across the state lines.
They can't enforce laws
that don't exist.
Then it's up to
the federal government
to do something about it.
You're the government!
All of you!
Instead of trying to hide
the facts, get laws passed
that'll do some good!
For instance?
Pass a federal law...
that puts the gun
in the same class as drugs
and white slavery!
Put teeth
in the deportation act!
These gangsters
don't belong in this country.
Half of'em aren't citizens!
That's true. They bring nothing
but disgrace to my people.
Make laws and see
that they're obeyed...
if we have to have
martial law to do it!
The governor of New Mexico
declared martial law
to stop a bullfight,
the governor of Oklahoma
to regulate oil production!
Surely gang rule
and wholesale law defiance...
are more of a menace
to the nation...
than the regulation of oil
or a bullfight!
The army will help.
So will the American Legion.
They offered their services
over two years ago!
And nobody
ever called on 'em.
Let's get wise to ourselves.
We're fighting organized murder!
That Sadie Thompson,
she's pretty smart girl.
What's a girl wanna
hustle in a place
like that for?
Yeah, it's
rainin' all the time.
Yeah, that rain.
That's pretty good.
That comes from a pipe,
just like a shower.
Them two fellas...
Which one do you think
she takes?
The guy with the collar?
Nah. He ain't so hot.
Hey, listen. Them marines
ain't so hot too.
Come on. I go take a smoke.
That's a fine show.
I gotta see more
shows like that.
You know, serious.
Ain't got no jokes.
I like a show with jokes.
That's-a dope.
What more do you want?
Listen, this girl Sadie,
she's got what you call
a problem.
This fella with
the collar, he's gonna...
What's the matter?
They found Gaffney.
Spotted him down
at Frank's Bowling Alley.
He got in a game.
Yeah?
It's a setup.
Take about an hour...
I'm lookin' at a show now.
Listen, it's the last act.
There's two fellas after a girl
which is called Sadie, see?
And this girl Sadie,
she's been what you call...
disillusioned.
We gotta do it now!
He's liable
to slip us again.
He's the last one, boss.
Come on, Tony.
Ah, that's too bad.
All right, come on.
Wait a minute.
You stay here.
You stay
and see the show.
Ah, boss!
I gotta know which fella
this girl Sadie, she take.
You stay here and find out,
then come and tell me.
It's all right, boss.
The copper's gone.
All right.
Come on.
Hey, Little Boy,
you go around the back,
up on the balcony.
Hey, Pietro, side door.
He may have friends.
You never can tell.
Joe, I want you to stand
in the alley. If he gets
that far, you do your stuff.
You keep the motor running.
Bring the presents.
You stay here.
Come on, fellas.
Ah, now we'll know what happened
to that girl, Sadie.
Angelo, did she take
the guy with the collar?
Nah. She climb back
in the hay with the army.
Yeah? That's fine.
She's a smart girl, that kid.
Come on.
What're you doin'?
Not bad, huh?
Just watch this one.
How are you?
Ahhh, that's-a pretty hot!
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello, stranger.
Chair. Well, Johnny!
Well, you're lookin' swell.
I thought we were gonna
see something of you.
- Well, here I am.
- Where have you been?
On a vacation?
I've been workin'.
Up on the North Side,
huh, Johnny?
That's what the papers say.
Don't work too hard.
You get your own table,
Camonte.
Why is that?
This is a table for two.
Well, maybe you get
another table, huh, Johnny?
Hey, listen, you!
Who do you think you are?
What are you tryin' to do?
All right, go on.
Nothing seems
to bother you much,
does it?
Well, I get used to noises.
Hello, Guino.
Hello, baby.
Why are you always
high-hatting me?
Go on, beat it.
I suppose you need
an organ grinder to work with?
Tony's inside. He see you
in that outfit?
I looked pretty good
from two stories up.
Am I different now?
Wanna dance with me?
Listen, you're
Tony's sister, see?
Besides,
you're only a kid.
I'm 18.
You like that music?
Now do you wanna dance?
No.
Afraid! Afraid
ofTony's sister! Why, you...
Well, I notice
you stood there and watched.
Someday you'll find out
you've been missing something.
Hey, how about it,
you and me, huh?
I thought
you weren't dancing.
I changed my mind.
I need exercise.
We show 'em
somethin', huh?
I think you missed me, huh?
That's right.
We make up for lost time.
How do you wanna play,
Tony? Like this?
That's it.
You wait here.
I take her home myself.
You can't!
Shut up!
You'll be sorry for this.
Next time I catch you
in a place like that,
I'm gonna kill you.
You're telling me what
to do? I'll do what I want,
same as you! Understand?
You listen to me!
I hate you!
Never mind what I do!
That's all right.
You're gonna stay home,
understand?
I'm no baby!
I can take care of myself!
Yeah, runnin' around
with the fellas, huh?
Letting 'em hold you like that?
Letting 'em look at you?
Dressin' up like that
for fellas to see, huh?
What I do with fellas
is my business!
Cesca!
Oh, Mama.
Cesca, what's the matter?
What-a Tony do to you, huh?
What he do?
He hit me.
He said he'd kill me,
and I wasn't doing anything.
I was only dancing!
That's all right,
No cry.
All right, tell-a Mama.
Come on upstairs.
No cry, baby.
He hasn't any right to.
Just because I'm his sister, he
can't throw me around like that.
All right, no cry, baby.
I tell you.
I tell you lotsa times!
He hurt you! He hurt you!
He hurt everybody.
See if you can put out
his tires.
Right.
That got 'er!
Look out!
Just shut up.
Give us some nickels.
Give us some nickels.
Hurry!
Lakeside 1305.
Get me a drink.
- Hello?
- Hello. Is this Jim?
Tony Camonte.
Is Rinaldo there?
No, Mr. Camonte.
He left an hour ago.
Is Lovo there?
Lovo? No.
He left too.
Said he was going
back to the office.
Bosworth 4503.
- Hello?
- Hello. Mabel?
Camonte.
Rinaldo there?
Why, no. He ain't been here.
You know, I think that guy's
givin' me the runaround.
I've had a date with him
two or three times...
Maybe he going home to bed.
Ah, what're you talkin'...
That tom cat!
Try Maizie.
Maizie. That's right.
I forgot about her.
Uh... uh, Hatfield 6401.
Yeah, 6401.
- Come on.
-
- Hello?
- Hello, Maizie?
It's Tony Camonte.
Rinaldo there?
Yeah. For you.
- Hello?
- Hello, Rinaldo?
I'm at Pietro's.
Pietro's!
- Yeah, come right away.
- Anything wrong?
Yeah, plenty.
Go get me a towel.
I thought you weren't
doing anything tonight.
I'll be back later.
This is worse than being
in love with a grasshopper.
It took you a long time
to get here.
Who done it?
I don't know,
but I got an idea.
You just wait. How
do you stand with Lovo?
Huh?
Come on!
How do you stand
with Lovo?
Who's Lovo?
That's good.
Say when.
That's enough.
You callJohnny Lovo
at his office at 10
minutes past 2:00, see?
That's 10 minutes
past 2:00.
You say that you callin'
from the country, see?
Uh-huh.
You one of the guys
that took me for a ride.
Uh-huh.
Car got smashed,
and I got away.
The car got smashed,
and I got away!
Yes, yes.
You think it was Johnny?
I don't know, but
we'll find out now.
We'll be there
when Pietro calls.
And if it was Johnny,
he'll stall, won't he?
Sure.
Let's go.
Open the door!
Come on. Let's go.
Hey, Tony, where you been?
What happened to you?
Yeah, look. They spoil
my brand-new suit.
Nah. Monkeys.
Never seen 'em before.
Somebody must've brought 'em in.
How did they get you?
They smashed my bus,
took me for a ride... almost.
That's right.
You left the café alone.
You oughta know better
than to do that. Where were you?
Well, baby,
I'm glad you got away.
I'd have missed you plenty.
I'll get somebody for this.
I knew you would, Johnny.
That's Poppy. I don't
want to see her tonight.
I'll tell her you ain't in.
Hey, wait a minute.
I'll talk to her.
Hello? Who?
Oh, ring off.
You got a wrong number.
You better have a drink,
Tony.
You?
It's a lie!
I didn't do it!
I wouldn't try anything
on you, Tony! We're pals!
Sure, we're pals.
No, I didn't do it.
You got me wrong.
Listen, Tony, you're
the last guy in the world
I'd try to cross.
Poppy! I'll let you have her.
I give you my word.
You can have Poppy, Tony!
I'll tell her!
The boss!
No!
Let me go away!
Gimme a break!
I ain't never did
anything to anybody!
I never hurt anybody!
Nah, you get somebody else
to do it for ya!
No!
Wait! Don't!
Tony, come back!
Oh, Tony.
What's happened?
- Where's Johnny?
- Where do you think?
Go pack your stuff.
Hey, come here.
Lookit there.
Tony isn't here.
He's out of town.
You're telling me?
Why did you hang up
when I called yesterday?
Too busy.
The one on the end's
kind of cute.
She ain't bad.
I should think you'd want
something more like...
Like what?
Me.
Cut out
that sort of talk.
You're only a kid.
I told you I had
grown-up ideas.
You're like Tony
when you go after
something, hey?
What would Tony say?
He'll be away for a month.
The big fella's
on his way from Florida.
Uh-huh. Well,
he better watch his step.
This town's entirely different
than when he left it.
That new crowd
down at the city hall
is looking for him.
The first crack he makes,
they'll climb all over him.
Hand it to Hap.
Tell him to play it
for what it's worth.
Hey. You stay out here.
Tony.
Where's Cesca?
She got a place of her own.
She say to me, " Shut up.
Mind-a your business."
Well, is she livin' alone?
Yeah.
All-a the time
that what she tell me.
But one day I follow her.
She meet a man. They go
in the house together.
I look and I see her name
under the push bell.
See? See what you do?
Once I have a son,
I have a daughter...
Shhh.
Where is the place
she live?
What you gonna do?
What you... No, no, Tony!
Stop!
Central Street.
He was goin' downgrade
makin' 90 miles an hour
When his whistle
broke into a scream
And they found him
in the wreck
With his hands
on the throttle
Scalded to death
by the steam
It's a mighty rough road
from Lynchburg to Danville
And the track's
on the three-mile grade
It was on this road
that he lost his air brakes
You can see
what a jump he made
Hello.
Hello, baby.
I'm so happy.
You're telling me?
You do love me,
don't you, Guino?
You know I do.
Never stop telling me,
will you?
I'm not like
all the others, am I?
You're up there
all by yourself, sweetheart.
We'll always
be happy, won't we?
Hello, Tony.
Tony, I...
Tony, don't! Tony!
Guino! Guino!
Guino, speak to me!
Speak to me!
Guino, say something!
Guino!
Tony, he's my Guino!
I love him.
We were married yesterday, Tony!
Really married!
We were going to surprise you.
Weren't we, Guino?
Oh, darling, speak to me!
He's dead.
He's dead.
He loved me,
really loved me.
Don't touch me!
Don't come near me!
Stay away from me!
You're not my brother!
Don't you think I know?
Murderer!
He kills people!
He kills everybody!
He kills everything!
He's a butcher.
That's what you are.
You're a butcher!
You're a butcher!
Drive down to the house.
Come on, boss.
Go on, beat it!
Get outta here!
Come on! Come on!
This Mr. Camonte's secre...
You'll have to speak loud.
I can't hear you.
It's... It's Poppy, boss.
I-I got her name.
I didn't know.
I didn't know.
