PUNJAB PROVINCE
Philipine authorities now say the toll in yesterday's
hotel bombing has risen to 146 dead and 231 wounded
It is the most devastating terrorist attack in Asia,
in 10 years. And the worst ever, in Manila.
While no organization has taken
responsibility for the blast,
Western intelligence sources have identified
chemical traces that are the hallmark of
the infamous arms-dealer, Aarmir Barkawi
International security experts say that the Barkawi
family is now instigating violence in remote capitals
To foster instability, and thus fuel
massive arms sales around the globe.
- Kamran
- Raza
Did Philippine Intelligence track you?
Father,
- You did well,
- Thank you.
We need to discuss Major General Rahmad.
It's your sister's wedding.
I'm sorry, this can't wait.
I think your ISI officer was compromised.
Kamran, all Pakistani intelligence
officers are compromised.
One of our Afghani friends discovered
a German BND agent in his circle.
And?
That particular general won't be very
useful to us anymore. He's been eliminated.
Thought you might want to know.
Don't forget his family.
Vengeance must always be profound,
and absolute.
Very happy.

But let's make sure this runs

And what special requests did
the  circus demand so far?
Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders,

That's a request I can get with
I'm partial to the Kardashians, myself.
As apparently is Her Majesty.
We denied all of them.
Any issues or special concern
with our current assessment?

have traveled back and forth
to Syria in the past year,
As we've seen before in Iraq,

Of rising concern is the handful

- No.
Very well ..

What are you guys so damn nervous about?
The Brits are world-class.
We all know their reputation.
But still,
These are the trips I hate.
Last minute, out of the country,
no time to plan.
Are you sure I can't talk you out of this?
Lynn, it's a state funeral.
They're our oldest, strongest ally.
Alright.  I spent half the night
on the line with our advance team.
Metropolitan Police will secure the parameter
of the funeral around St. Paul's Cathedral.
Air Force One will land at
Stansted Airport
On the ground, it's all Mike.
Touch down. Then a 12-minute chopper
ride to Somerset House.
From there we take an armoured vehicle escort
down Sweet Street .. to the Cathedral
You don't seem thrilled.
The British have their hands full.
It's a cluster-fuck .. sir.
Well,
Forty different countries,
with 40 different security teams.
Minimal flexibility on approach routes.

- Can we make it work?
- Mike?
I always do, sir.
Good.
I know it's not great timing for you, but ..
It's what I do.
Thank you sir.
- There's my man.
- Mr. Vice-President,
- How was your vacation, sir?
- Son,
Do you have any idea, the joy a man feels
pulling a 70-lb king macarel out of the
waters around Jekyll Island?
- No, sir, I don't.
- That makes two of us.
And I'll have to wait till next year to find out.
But, thanks for asking.
- It's beautiful.
- There you go.
- It's pretty.
- I love these things.
Don't worry about a thing, we'll be fine.
- Doris, can we have a minute?
- Sure.
- Oh you meant Leah? right.
- Very funny, Doris.
She tells me not to worry.
It's only three days.
- Yeah,
- And I'm not due for two weeks.
- Walking away, it's not so easy this time.
Hey, I got this.
You go and you do what you have to do, and
we'll be right here when you get back.
Okay? Here, say bye bye to Daddy.
Bye, bye Daddy.

I love you
You better.
Behave.
- Ah, here you go.
- Thank you.
You've been   hiding lately.
You've been busy nesting?
- Something like that.
- Mm, hmm.
Your idea of nesting being, bullet-proofing
the walls of the nursery?
Now, that is actually a great idea.
Yes,
I'll do it.
Well, that only took two weeks.
Hm, mmm. That's no small thing being a god-mother.
I didn't take your asking lightly.
Oh, I know. You think you can handle it?
Well, I'm competent, brilliant,

It was a trap.
That's an understatement.
Holy shit.  It's one thing to plan

Alright, well, we're good now.
- It'll be okay.
- Yeah.
We'll be on secure ground in 10 minutes, okay?
There was no chatter on this. None.
Something of this magnitude, it took
years to plan. And we're in a daze.
It's a fucken bloodbath.
- How did they do this, Mike?
- They only have to get it right once.
Today, they got it right way more than that.

Mr. President we're going to take a hit.
Brace for impact.
Our families, remotely from the sky.
Your time .. is over.
We're bringing the war, to you.
Make no mistake.
This is the day,
when your world changes forever.
- Jesus. -- This is all over social media too.
Everybody in the world has seen this.
Aamir Bakawi.
Number six on the 10 list.
This man is responsible for
more deaths than the Plague.
Sells arms to every failed state in the world.
Has a vast array of connections,
terrorists, mercenaries, corporations,
- Mr. Vice-President, it's Barkawi.
- Put him through.
Thought you might take my call.
You understand if I make it difficult to track.
You have me at somewhat of a loss.
I thought you would've learned a lesson
by now, about crawling out of your hole.
- I've never lifted a finger against you.
- You arm those who have.
I sold triggers, Mr. Trumbull.
Just like you.
What do you want?
Your President.
You can end this right now.
- Just hand him over.
- That's not going to happen.
Then every death from this moment
forward, will be on your head.
Barkawi, sells arms to dummy companies.
Some of them probably in London.
Find a connection to him.
He's probably been planning this for
years. Everybody makes a mistake.
We have to find him before
he finds the President.
Let's get to it.
- Mike is a bully?
- Yeah.
Not exactly standard police issue.
Really?
Oh, my god.
- I've never seen a man suffocate before.
- I didn't have a knife.
Got  more ammunition than
the entire US Army.
How can they pull something like this off.
Gots to be somebody on the inside.
Yeah, looks like it.
These aren't you typical hill-trained
hillbillies. These guys are pros.
- We should go for the Embassy.
- They'll be expecting that.
There's a MI-6 safehouse near here.
I have a contact there.
We go there, we get geared up, and get an extraction.
- Do you trust them? -- Yeah.
The fact is, every single one of these guys
is a terrorist asshole. Until proven otherwise.
The only person you trust right now,
is me, okay?
Come on, let's go.
- Gotta get underground.
- These guys are everywhere.
Let's go.
Stay here. I'll be back.
Raza ..
Raza
Here ..
We can do easy, or the hard way.
Raza. Answer me, brother.
Raza's not feeling too well at the moment.
He's a little bit fucked up.
Hey, you. What's this dick guy's name?
- This is Kamra. Who is this?
- Hey, Cameron.
- My name is Mike Banning.
- You are the one with the President.
Bingo. So why don't you boys pack up your shit and head
back to Fuckeninstan or wherever it is you're from.
You should've let us kill him quickly.
Because now, we're going to kill him slowly.
And stream it live. For the whole world to see.
Can you hear me, Mr. President?
- Tell him,
- Yeah, he can hear you.
And here's something I want you hear first.
That's the sound of your brother dying. Yeah.
Not much of a talker, that one.
But I bet one of your men will.
I'll see you soon, Cameron
- Was that really necessary?
- No.
The Brits are compromised.
The police for sure.
Who do you trust?
We can also assume all communications
are compromised.
Anything that isn't secured,
could get into the wrong hands, sir.
- And Banning would know that too.
- So how could he even reach out for help?
There, freeze that. Sir,
- Is Banning left-handed?
- No, right-handed.
Okay, well, the President doesn't move
without a drone or satellite over his head.
- Banning knows that.
- That's his left hand.
- Southpaw .. six.
- Shorthand for MI-6.
Look for any MI-6 location in that are.
- Yes, sir.
- Alright, Banning.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
-  , bad choice.
- Hah,
Sit down, take deep breaths.
How many you think died?
I don't know .. A lot.
All those innocent people.
Dead ... Because of me.
No. Not because of you. Because of them.
They tried to kill you, sir.
And they killed all these people, just
to make everyone else more afraid.
Well, fuck that.
Fuck them.
Mike ..
You don't let them take me.
- I'm not going to.
- You need to do it.
If it comes to it.  If it's going south.
If it comes to it, I want you to kill me.
That' an order.
I will not be prosecuted for propaganda.
As my son and the American people see me on
fucken YouTube for the rest of their lives.
.. Okay.
- Vice President Trumbull is among us, sir.
- Inspector.
I'm afraid our .. news isn't promising.
Our dearly departed Prime Minister
James Wilson was assassinated.
Poison in his anesthesia, and his doctor's
body found dumped about an hour ago.
State funeral ..
Must-attend event for western leaders.
Each one a target.
Goddamn.
And we walked right into it.
And all dead. By your men and ours.
What's happening on the ground?
The terrorists have killed 19 first-
responders. We've another 30 unaccounted for.
They're impersonating us. Our people
are walking right into ambushes.
Say the word and we go in.
But make no mistake.  We risk turning
London into another Fallujah.
That's the last thing we need.
The President in the middle of an urban battle.
Or the citizens of London.
Or you're just as likely to take out
half the Metropolitan Police Force,
Unless you can tell me how you can tell the
difference between the good guys and the bad guys.
- We're have to stand down our Emergency Services.
- Surrender London?
He's right.
Take out all legitimate personnel.
Anyone that remains .. is a terrorist.
Look, the sooner we end this,
The more chance there is of stopping
London becoming a complete warzone.
Well, how do we get the
word out to our people?

We  sound that, people know to
stay secure in their place, then ...
You have the military sweep in.
door-to-door, if necessary.
Clear these bastards out.
- Good evening.
- Is Auntie M in?
Put that away.
- Are you who I think you are?
- Unfortunately
What a pleasure this is, two handsome men
visiting me on such a lovely evening.
- Long time, Jackson. -- Eh, not long enough.
-- Mr. President.
Sir,
- Jaqueline, MI-6 finest.  Don't fuck with her.
- Hello.
The phones are down.  That said,
It did allow us to pick up this..
Mr. President, Banning ..
I hope this finds you well.
Mike, we got your message.
And I'm sure you don't know
who you can trust,
and all prior authentications
may be compromised.
So .. I offer you this,
Do you have any idea the joy a man experiences pulling a
That's him.
a Delta Team has been clandestinely inserted.
By now they should en route to your position.
They'll take you to the US Embassy, where an armored
convoy stands by to get you out of SAM range.
- And on to a military train.
- Thank god.
- Let's get us out of here.
- Alright, sir.  So who's behind all this?
Aamir Bakawi.
Bakawi provides armaments.
He's a fucken criminal.
Shielded by governments.
Mike, there was a drone strike, to get him.
Two years ago, authorized by the G8.
So we took a shot.
He survived
We didn't know his family was there.
His daughter was killed.
Well, he certainly got his revenge.
- Civilians?
- Well, they're not being targeted specifically, but ..
- Collateral damage?
- Yeah, quite a lot, I'm afraid.
targeting. No official support from
any countries Barkawi shows, but..
Didn't have any problems finding the creeps today,
United Nations all with blood on their hands.
- Who's on the inside? There's gotta be somebody.
- Yeah, you're right.
They've infiltrated our CCTV system.
And they've copied the Wi-Fi network.
- Yeah, but who?
- I don't know.
Mike ..
if you hadn't move our schedule up.
- Here you go sir, get this in you.
- Thanks.
- I don't know about you, but I'm thirsty as fuck.
- Yeah.
- How're you doing?
- I was thinking about my son.
He sends me these jokes every day.
It's kind of our, our thing.
A little off-color.
His mother wouldn't approve.
I tell you something Mike, These little
messages I get from him everyday,
They mean everything, you'll see.
Most important thing, never criticize.
Always encourage.
You just want them to be passionate.
That's what I always tell my son.
Find something you care about, and care deeply.
That and the Golden Rule.
Treat others as you like to be treated.
- That's it?
- Yeah, basically.
What about all the other stuff.
Sleeping, eating, electrical outlets,
diapers, stairs, and ...
That stuff takes care of itself.
- Really?
- No, hah ha, you'll figure it out.
Okay, your dates have arrived.
That's under construction.
No one lives or works there.
- That's why this is particularly interesting.
- I had my NSA analysts take a peek at the power usage ..
Through the roof the last three weeks.
pretty odd, considering no one
lives or works there.
Central London.
Right under our bloody noses.
Tell the SAS that we're going
to make a house call.
Mike,
to your right.
Left.
There's no way to dress this up, sir.
It isn't good.
Could be worse. Could be
Atta boy.  Don't stop for anyone.
- Are we clear?
- Yeah, ha hah. We fucken made it.
Ha ha, we did.
Where is he?
Where the fuck?  Where is he?
Were did they take him?
Back off, take it easy, take it easy!
You've gotta be Banning.
,
Captain Tutu, SAS
President Asher has just been taken.
And these assholes intend
to publicly execute him.
We know, at 8:00 PM.
It's all over the internet.
- We'll take care of that.  Move out!
- Hey, hey, wait.
you come this with me.
How many times you've saved this man's ass?
Now, I'm going to go get him.
And you can kill me,
Or you can come with me.
But I ain't going to go any other way.
After you.
- CCTV is back up.
- What did you do?
Disable the authorization code
that shut down the CCTV system.
Wait ..
What authorization code?
:::: 19:50 ::::
You should be thankful.
How many men get to experience
their death witnessed by billions .. live?
You are going to go down in history.
I'm not the only that's going
to die today, Kamran.
- Post Command.
- Banning.
Mike Banning? Chief Inspector Hazard,
Scotland Yard. Hold your position.
- Our military will be on your location in 20 minutes.
- No sir.
- The President's going to be dead in 10.
- You don't understand,
We have NSA imagery of where you're going.
It's their base of operations.
There are nealy a 100 terrorists in there.
Yeah, well.
They should have brought more men.
- Things are ready to get sporty.
- Just watch your balls.
Will do.
RPG!
Yeah, they kill the President
the second we try it.
Alright call Fox Command ..
- The generator? -- Yeah
- Let's pull out the plug. -- Yeah.
- What happened?
- The power supply was just cut.
Get the emergency generators up.
Come on!
Banning, this is what we got.
This is a three-story building..
The entry point is here.  There are
two stairwells. One here, and one here.
We believe the President is being held
in this room, on the second floor.
Hold your position. I need you to hit
this building with everything you got.
- You got it.
- Keep them busy. I'll sneak inside.
Take that. Do not press that
button till I tell you.
- Are you fucken crazy?
- Yeah. Wish me luck.
:::: 19:55 ::::
They are almost here.
Why don't you just kill him now?
No!
The whole world needs to see this.
Hear that, Kamran?
That's the sound of inevitability.
I am going to kill you live. But that doesn't
mean you can't suffer privately first.
Look at me!
I held my sister as she died in my arms.
You're the monsters, Mr. President.
It won't justify your insanity
to make you better about yourself.
Shoot him!
:::: 19:57 ::::
Almost, waiting for
the internet connection.
Technology, only as good as
the dumbshits that are using it.
- How long?
- Seconds.
- We are live now.
- Okay.
Say hello to the world, Mr. President.
:::: 20:00 ::::
Any last words, Mr. President?
I do solemnly swear, that I will faithfully execute
the office of the President of the United States.
Son of a bitch.
.. the United States.
And to the best of my ability
preserve, protect, and defend ..
Oh, my god.
I'm not watching this.
You know what you guys don't get:
We're not a fucken ,
we're not a fucken flag,
we're not just one man...
And assholes like you, have been trying
to kill us for a long fucken time..
But you know what,
A thousand years from now..
We'll still fucken be here.
Mike! Grenade!
- What took you so long?
- Sorry, I had a couple of errands to run.
Shit, does this fucker ever die?
Alright, we gotta get out of here,
You good?
Go! Move, move, move!
Mike!  Come on!
I'm out.
I'm out too.
Come in!  We're trapped!
I repeat we are trapped.
- Blow it!

This war will not end.

Two weeks after the devastating
attacks on the British capital,
A new government has been installed,
and the city, has begun to rebuild.
In the words of Prime Minister Clarkson:
"London may have fallen, but it has
always endured, and will rise again."
So Daddy is going to take some
more time off, isn't that cool?
Yeah, maybe it's the new me.
He says he reckons I've earned a few
days off. Thanks to you, little one.
I wonder what you're going to
be passionate about, Matt?
