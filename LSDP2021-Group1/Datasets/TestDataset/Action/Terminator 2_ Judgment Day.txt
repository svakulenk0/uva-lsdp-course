Three billion human lives ended on August 29, 1997.
The survivors of the nuclear fire called the war 'Judgment Day."
They lived only to face a new nightmare
the war against the machines.
The computer which controlled the machines, Skynet,...
...sent two Terminator back through time.
Their mission: to destroy the leader of the human Resistance...
...John Connor, my son.
The first Terminator was programmed to
strike at me in the year 1984,...
...before John was born.
It failed.
The second was set to strike at John himself
when he was still a child.
As before, the resistance was able to send a lone warrior,...
...a protector for John.
It was just a question of which one
of them would reach him first.
Oh!
I need your clothes, your boots and your motorcycle.
You forgot to say "please."
Ooh!
Get him off me!
Pull it out!
Pull it out!
Oh, pull it out!
Take it.
Can't let you take the man's wheels, son.
Now, get off before I put you down.
That's it, goddamn it.
R-31 David, Sherman Code Six
at the Sixth Street Bridge and Santa Fe...
...on an electrical disturbance.
Ten-four, R-31 David.
Come on.
Let's go to my house.
John?
John, get in there and clean up that pigsty of yours.
John!
Your foster parents are kind of dicks, huh?
I swear, I have had it with that goddamn kid.
- He won't even answer me anymore.
- Honey, move.
Would you get off your butt and help me?
- Todd!
- What? What?
He hasn't cleaned that room of his in a month.
Well, it's an emergency.
Hang on. I'll get right on it.
Come on!
John! Come on. Get your ass inside.
Do what your mother tells ya.
She's not my mother, Todd.
Yeah-ha-ha!
This next patient is interesting.
I've been following the case for years.
- A 29-year-old female diag...
- Hey, hey! Come on.
...diagnosed as acute schizo-affective disorder.
The usual indicators: depression, anxiety,
violent acting out, delusions of persecution.
The delusional architecture is fairly unique.
She believes that a machine called the Terminator,...
...which looks human ofcourse,
was sent back through time to kill her.
- That's original.
- And also that the father of her child...
...was a soldier sent back to protect her.
- No.
- He was from the future too.
The year, uh, 2029, if I remember correctly.
And here we are.
Morning, Sarah.
Good morning, Dr. Silberman.
How's the knee?
Fine, Sarah.
She, uh, stabbed me in the kneecap
with my pen a few weeks ago.
Repeated escape attempts.
Let's move on, shall we?
Douglas, I don't like to see the patients
disrupting their rooms like this.
- See that she takes her Thorazine.
- Sure, Dr. Silberman. I'll take care of it.
Time to take your meds, Connor.
You take it.
Now, you know you gotta be good 'cause
you're up for review this afternoon.
I'm not taking it, Dougie.
I don't want any trouble.
Ain't no trouble.
Yeah, zap her.
Last call, sugar.
Sweet dreams.
Are you the legal guardian of John Connor?
That's right, Officer.
What's he done now?
- Could I speak with him, please?
- You could if he were here.
He took off on his bike this morning, so he could be anywhere.
Do you have a photograph of John?
Yeah. Sure. Hold on.
You gonna tell me what this is about?
I just need to ask him a few questions.
He's a good-looking boy.
Do you mind if I keep this picture?
No, go on.
There was a guy here this morning looking for him too.
Yeah, a big guy on a bike.
Has that got something to do with this?
No. I wouldn't worry about him.
Thanks for your cooperation.
Please insert your stolen card now.
PIN number.
- Will you hurry up? This is taking too long.
- Go, baby. Go, baby. Go, baby.
All right.
PIN number 9003.
- Where'd you learn this stuff from anyway?
- From my mom.
My real mom, I mean.
Um, withdraw 300 bucks.
Come on, baby. Come on!
Come on. Come on!
- Yes!
- Hey, it worked.
All right. Easy money.
Come on!
- Yes! Piece of cake.
- Yeah!
- Is that her?
- Yes.
So she's pretty cool, huh?
No, she's a complete psycho.
That's why she's up at Pescadero.
It's a mental institute. Okay?
She tried to blow up a computer factory,
but she got shot and arrested.
No shit.
She's a total loser.
- Come on. Let's go spend some money.
- All right.
Sarah.
Sarah. Wake up.
Kyle.
- You're dead.
- Where's our son, Sarah?
They took him away from me.
- He's the target now.
- I know.
- He's all alone and you have to protect him.
- I know.
You tell me how I'm supposed to do that.
He doesn't even believe me anymore.
I've lost him.
You're strong, Sarah.
Stronger than you ever thought you could be.
- No.
- On your feet, soldier.
I love you, Sarah.
I always will.
I need you.
I'll always be with you.
Remember the message.
The future is not set.
There is no fate but what we make for ourselves.
Stay with me.
There's not much time left in the world, Sarah.
Kyle, don't go!
Kyle!
Mommy, watch this!
Watch this, Mommy!
Whoa!
It's like a giant strobe light...
...burning right through my eyes.
Somehow I can still see.
Oh, God.
We know the dream's the same every night.
- Why do I have to --
- Please continue.
Children look like burnt paper.
Black.
Not moving.
And then the blast wave hits them.
And they fly apart like leaves.
Dreams of cataclysm, the end of the world, are very common.
It's not a dream, you moron.
It's real.
- I know the date it happens.
- I'm sure it feels very real to you.
On August 29, 1997,
it's gonna feel pretty fuckin' real to you too!
Anybody not wearing two million sunblock
is gonna have a real bad day. Get it?
God, you think you're safe and alive.
You're already dead. Everybody!
Him. You. You're dead already.
This whole place, everything you see is gone!
You're the one living in a fucking dream,
Silberman, 'cause I know it happens!
It happens!
I feel much better now.
Clearer.
Yes, your attitude has been...
...much improved lately.
It's helped me to have a goal,
something to look forward to.
What is that?
Well, you said...
...that if I showed improvement after six months,...
...you would transfer me to the minimum security wing
and I could have visitors.
Well, it's been six months, and...
...I was looking forward to seeing my son.
I see.
Let's go back to what you were saying
about those Terminator machines.
Now you think they don't exist?
They don't exist.
I know that now.
But you've told me on many occasions
about how you crushed one in a hydraulic press.
If I had, there would have been some evidence.
They would have found something at the factory.
I see.
So you don't believe anymore that the company covered it up?
No. Why would they?
Let's try a new position right there.
Those neurons are all saturated.
Mr. Dyson? Mr. Dyson.
The materials team is running another-
- Mr. Dyson.
- Yeah?
The materials team is running another series this afternoon.
You have to sign for the-- the, uh-- it.
- You have to sign it out.
- Okay. Come on. I'll get it.
Listen, Mr. Dyson.
I know I haven't been here that long,
but I was wondering if you could tell me-- I mean, if you know--
- Know what?
- Well, if you know where "it" came from.
You know, I asked them that very same question once.
You know what they told me?
"Don't ask."
- Good morning, Mr. Dyson.
- How's it going?
Okay. Insert key.
Left on three, two, one. Turn.
- How are the wife and kids? There you go.
- Great. Thanks.
So what do you think, Doctor?
I have shown improvement, haven't I?
Well, Sarah, here's the problem.
I know how smart you are,
and I think you're just telling me what I want to hear.
I don't think you really believe what you're telling me today.
I think if I put you in minimum security,
you'll just try to escape again.
You have to let me see my son.
Please. Please.
He's in great danger.
He's naked without me.
If I could just make a phone call--
I'm afraid not.
Not for a while.
I don't see any choice but to recommend to the review board
that you stay here for another six months.
- I'll kill you, you son of a bitch!
- Now, calm down--
- Douglas! Douglas!
- You son of a bitch!
Get her off!
Ten c.c.'s of sodium amobarbital, stat!
You don't know what you're doing!
Get some restraints in here now!
- You don't know what you're doing!
- Got her?
God!
Model citizen.
Bam
You just missed him.
He was here, like, 15 minutes ago.
- I think he said he was going to the galleria, right?
- Yeah.
The galleria?
- I've never seen him.
- Yeah. He's in the arcade.
- Hey, bro, I'm gonna get some quarters. I'll be back, all right?
- Cool.
- Oh, no!
- Girls, do you know John Connor?
No.
- Oh!
- Hey, do you know this guy?
Nah, I don't know him.
- John.
- Not now. Not now.
Hey. Man, there's this cop scoping for you.
Check it out.
- Yeah. He's right over there.
- Split, man. Just go.
Yeah.
Hey, man, I think I saw that kid you were looking--
Hey!
Hey! You're not supposed to be in here!
Hey! Hey!
Get down.
Hey, mister, are you all right?
Mister, you all right?
Come on!
Come on!
Shit.
Damn!
Okay, time-out.
Stop the bike.
Time-out.
Come on. Stop the bike.
Holy shit. Now, don't take this the wrong way,
but you are a Terminator, right?
Yes. Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.
No.
Ho-- Holy shit.
You're really real.
I mean--
You-- You're like a machine underneath, right?
But sort of alive outside?
I'm a cybernetic organism.
Living tissue over metal endoskeleton.
This is intense.
Get a grip,John. Okay.
Um--
You're not here to kill me.
I figured that part out for myself.
- So what's the deal?
- My mission is to protect you.
Yeah? Who sent you?
You did. Thirty-five years from now, you reprogrammed me...
...to be your protector here, in this time.
Oh, this is deep.
So this other guy, he's a Terminator like you, right?
Not like me.
A T-1000, advanced prototype.
- You mean, more advanced than you are?
- Yes. A mimetic poly-alloy.
- What the hell does that mean?
- Liquid metal.
Where are we going? We have to get out of the
city immediately and avoid the authorities.
Listen. I gotta stop by my house.
I wanna pick up some stuff.
Negative.
The T-1000 would definitely try to reacquire you there.
- You sure?
- I would.
Look, Todd and Janelle are dicks,...
...but I gotta warn 'em.
Shit. You got a quarter?
- Hello.
- Janelle, it's me.
- John?
- Yeah. Is everything all right?
- Are you guys okay?
- Sure, honey, everything's okay.
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
John, it's late.
Honey, I was beginning to worry about you.
If you hurry home, we can sit down and have dinner together.
- I'm making beefstew.
- Something's wrong. She's never this nice.
John? Where are you?
What the hell is the goddamn dog barking at?
Hey!
Shut up, you worthless piece of shit!
The dog's really barking.
I thought you were gonna tell the
kid to get rid of that fucking mutt.
John, honey, it's late.
Please don't make me worry.
Could he already be there?
- Honey, are you okay?
- I'm right here. I'm fine.
Are you sure?
Are you sure you're all right?
- What's the dog's name?
- Max.
Hey,Janelle.
What's wrong with Wolfie?
I can hear him barking.
Is he okay?
Wolfie's fine, honey.
Wolfie's just fine.
Where are you?
Your foster parents are dead.
Oh. I need a minute here.
You're telling me that this thing
can imitate anything it touches?
Anything it samples by physical contact.
Get real.
Like, it could disguise itself as a pack of cigarettes?
No, only an object of equal size.
Why not just become a bomb or something to get me?
It can't form complex machines.
Guns and explosives have chemicals, moving parts.
It doesn't work that way.
But it can form solid metal shapes.
- Like what?
- Knives and stabbing weapons.
Messages from Mom.
These were taken by a video surveillance camera...
...at the West Highland Police Station in 1984.
He killed 17 police officers that night.
Men with families, children.
These were taken at a mall in Reseda today.
Miss Connor, we know you know who this guy is.
Look, I just sat here and told you that your son is missing,...
...that the foster parents have been murdered.
We know this guy's involved.
Doesn't that mean anything to you?
Don't you care?
We're wasting our time.
- Let's go.
- I'm sorry, guys.
She's just grown more and more
disconnected from reality as time goes on.
I'm afraid she can't help us now.
If she clears at all and can give us anything,
then I'll call you.
Sure.
- Douglas, take her back to her room, please.
- Yes, sir.
Come on, sweetheart.
Let's go.
You see, we spent a lot of time in Nicaragua
and places like that.
For a while there, she was with this crazy ex-Green Beret guy...
...running guns.
Then there were some other guys.
She'd shack up with anybody she could learn from so
she could teach me how to be this great military leader.
Then she gets busted.
It's like, "Sorry, kid, your mom's a psycho.
Didn't you know?"
It's like everything I've been brought up
to believe was all made-up bullshit.
I hated her for that.
But everything she said was true.
She knew,...
...and nobody believed her,...
...not even me.
Listen.
We gotta get her out of there.
Negative.
The T-1000's highest probability for success now will be...
...to copy Sarah Connor and to wait for you to make contact with her.
Great. What happens to her?
Typically, the subject being copied is terminated.
Shit! Why didn't you tell me?
We gotta go right now!
Negative.
It's not a mission priority.
Yeah? Well, fuck youself!
She's a priority to me!
Hey, goddamn it!
What's your problem? Goddamn it!
- Help! Help!
- This does not help our mission.
Get this psycho off of me!
Help! Help!
- Help! I'm being kidnapped! Get this psycho off of me!
- Let's go check it out.
Let me go!
Why the hell did you do that?
Because you told me to.
What?
You have to do what I say, huh?
That's one of my mission parameters.
Prove it.
Stand on one foot.
Yes!
Cool. My own Terminator.
Wow.
You okay, kid?
- Take a hike, bozo. What?
- See? Let's get outta here, man.
Fuckyou, you little dipshit!
Dipshit?
Put your leg down.
Did you call moi a dipshit?
Just trying to help this punk.
Grab this guy.
I can't believe he called me a dipshit.
Get him off of me!
Now who's the dipshit, you jock douche bag?
Get off of him!
- No!
- Holy shit.
Put the gun down now!
- Get outta here!
- Come on, Gus. Let's split! Come on!
Jesus!
You were gonna kill that guy!
Ofcourse. I'm a Terminator.
Listen to me very carefully, okay?
You're not a Terminator anymore, all right?
You got that?
- You just can't go around killing people.
- Why?
What do you mean, why?
'Cause you can't.
- Why?
- Because you just can't, okay? Trust me on this.
Look. I'm gonna go get my mom,...
...and I order you to help me.
Hmph.
Hi.
You have a Sarah Connor here?
You're runnin' kind of late, aren't ya?
They've been in there for an hour.
Hold on a second.
I'll buzz you in.
Oh, here comes your friends now.
- Hey, Gwen, you want some coffee?
- No, thanks.
- How 'bout a beer?
- Yeah, right.
- Hey, I got a full house.
- That's good, Lewis.
Must be my lucky day.
Shut up!
Yeah, I think you're right about number 24.
Increase the medication to 250 milligrams.
- Same time?
- Mm-hmm.
You!
You broke my arm.
There are 215 bones in the human body.
- That's one. Now, don't move.
- All right.
What are you going to do?
Why do we stop now?
Now, you gotta promise me you're not gonna kill anyone, right?
- Right.
- Swear?
What?
Just put up your hand and say, "I swear I won't kill anyone."
I swear I will not kill anyone.
All right. Let's go.
Visiting hours is 10:00 to 4:00, Monday through Friday.
- What the hell are you doing?
- You son of a bitch! You shot me!
Crazy bastard! Oh, God!
Don't shoot me again.
Don't kill me.
Oh, my leg.
He'll live.
Son of a bitch!
- Let's all try to remain calm.
- Open it, or he'll be dead before he hits the floor.
There's no way, Connor.
Let him go.
- Open the door.
- It ain't gonna happen.
Take it easy, Sarah. Easy.
It won't work, Sarah. You're no killer.
I don't believe you can do it.
You're already dead, Silberman. Everybody dies.
You know I believe it. So don't fuck with me!
Open the door.
Open the door!
Open it.
Back off!
Get back!
- I'll pump him full of this shit. I swear!
- Back, back, back.
Don't move!
- Drop the shit!
- Do it. Do it!
Get in the office.
On the floor, face down.
Not you!
Open the door.
On the floor. Hold it open.
Face the wall!
Get her. Get her!
Sarah! Sarah!
Hurry up! Open the door!
The door's locked!
Let's go! Come on! Open it!
- Let's go, let's go!
- Come on, come on, come on!
- She broke it off.
- Open it!
Let's go around! Come on!
Move it! Come on!
No! No!
- No!
- Mom, wait!
Mom!
- Come back here!
- No!
No! No!
- Help her!
- Wait here.
- Hurry up! Hurry up!
- He'll kill us all!
- He'll kill us all!
- Hold her.
He'll kill us all!
Mom, are you okay? Mom!
Come with me if you want to live.
It's okay, Mom.
He's here to help. It's okay.
Go.
What the fuck is it?
What the fuck is going on?
Get down.
Mom!
Out of the car!
Right now!
Go!
I'm out.
- Come on.
- Here.
Reload.
Last one!
Hang on.
Ready!
John!
Here, drive.
He's not back there.
There's nobody behind us.
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.
- Can you even see anything?
- I see everything.
Cool.
Come here.
I said I was okay!
John, it was stupid of you to go there.
Goddamn it.
You have to be smarter than that.
You almost got yourself killed.
What were you thinking?
You cannot risk yourself, even for me.
Do you understand?
You're too important.
Do you understand?
But I had to get you out of that place.
I'm sorry.
I didn't need your help.
I can take care of myself.
What's wrong with your eyes?
Nothin'.
So, what's your story?
- You okay?
- Fine.
Say, that's a nice bike.
Hey! Watch it, lug nuts.
Listen.
Do you know what you're doing?
I have detailed files on human anatomy.
I bet.
- Makes you a more efficient killer, right?
- Correct.
Does it hurt when you get shot?
I sense injuries.
The data could be called "pain."
- John, help me with the light.
- Will these heal up?
- Yes.
- Good.
If you can't pass for human, you're not much good to us.
- How long do you live?
- I mean, last. Whatever.
A hundred and twenty years, with my existing power cell.
Can you learn stuff that you haven't
been programmed with so you can be,...
...you know, more human...
...and not such a dork all the time?
My C.P.U. is a neural net processor, a learning computer,...
...but Skynet presets the switch to read
only when we're sent out alone.
- Doesn't want you to do too much thinking, huh?
- No.
Can we reset the switch?
Rotate the two locking cylinders counter clockwise.
Do it.
Now open the port cover.
Pull, to break the seal.
Good. Now remove the shock-damping assembly.
You can now access the C.P.U.
- Do you see it?
- Yes.
Pull the C.P.U. beds base tab.
Pull.
Can you see the pin switch?
No, no!
- Out of my way, John.
- Don't kill him.
"It," John, not "him." "It."
Okay. "It."
But we need "it."
Listen to me. You listen.
We are better off on our own.
But he's the only proof we have
of the future and the war and all that!
Maybe.
I don't trust it.
But he's my friend, all right?
You don't know what it's like
to try to kill one of these things.
And if something goes wrong,
this could be our last chance, so move!
Look, Mom.
If I'm ever supposed to be this great military leader,...
...maybe you should start listening to
my leadership ideas once in a while!
Cause if my own mother won't, how do you expect anyone else to?
All right. Play it your way.
Was there a problem?
No problem.
None whatsoever.
Are we learning yet?
Hey!
We have to get as far away from the city as possible.
Just head south.
Keep it under 65.
- We don't want to be pulled over.
- Affirmative.
No, no, no, no, no.
You gotta listen to the way people talk.
You don't say "affirmative" or some shit like that.
You say, "No problemo."
And if someone comes off to you with an attitude,
you say, "Eat me."
And if you want to shine them on,
it's "Hasta la vista, baby."
Hasta la vista, baby.
Yeah, or "Later, dick-wad."
And if someone gets upset, you say, "Chill out."
Or you could do combinations.
Chill out, dick-wad.
That's great!
See? You're getting it.
No problemo.
You got any cash?
I got a couple hundred bucks.
I'll give you half.
- Mom!
- Okay.
- Get some food.
- Geez.
No sense of humor.
And that's another thing.
You can lighten up a bit yourself.
This severe routine is getting old, okay?
I mean, you're acting like such a geek.
- Smile once in a while.
- Smile?
Yeah. You know, smile.
Watch.
Hi. Nice place you got here.
How's business?
Give me a break.
Okay. Bad example.
See that guy over there?
That's a smile.
You're crazy.
That's good.
Maybe you could practice in front of a mirror or something.
Want some of my fries?
- Need any help?
- No.
- I got you!
- No, you didn't!
I got you!
I came around here and got you!
No, you didn't!
I told you I'm--
We're not gonna make it, are we?
People, I mean.
It's in your nature to destroy yourselves.
Yeah. Major drag, huh?
Break it up before I wring both of your necks. Come on.
I need to know how Skynet gets built.
- Who's responsible?
- The man most directly responsible is Miles Bennett Dyson.
Who is that?
He's the director of special projects
at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation.
Why him?
In a few months he creates a
revolutionary type of microprocessor.
Go on. Then what?
In three years Cyberdyne will become the
largest supplier of military computer systems.
All stealth bombers are upgraded with Cyberdyne computers,
becoming fully unmanned.
Afterwards they fly with a perfect operational record.
The SKYnet funding bill is passed.
The system goes online on August 4, 1997.
Human decisions are removed from strategic defense.
Skynet begins to learn at a geometric rate.
It becomes self-aware at 2:14 a.m.
Eastern time, August 29.
In a panic they try to pull the plug.
- SKYnet fights back.
- Yes.
It launches its missiles against the targets in Russia.
Why attack Russia?
Aren't they our friends now?
Because Skynet knows that the Russian
counterattack will eliminate its enemies over here.
Jesus.
How much do you know about Dyson?
I have detailed files.
I want to know everything.
What he looks like, where he lives, everything.
Miles?
Miles.
Oh!
- Hey.
- Hey.
You gonna work all day?
I'm sorry, baby, but this thing is just kicking my ass.
Miles, it's Sunday.
You promised to take the kids to Raging Waters today.
I can't. Um--
I'm on a roll.
Baby, this is gonna blow 'em all away.
- It's a-- It's a neural net processor
- I know. I know. You told me.
It's a neural net processor.
It thinks and learns like we do.
It's superconducting at room temperature.
- Other computers are just pocket calculators by comparison.
- Yeah.
But why is that so goddamn important, Miles?
I really need to know,
'cause sometimes I feel like I'm going crazy here.
Baby, I am this close.
Come here.
Imagine a-- a jet airliner...
...with a pilot that never gets tired, never makes mistakes,
never shows up to work with a hangover.
Meet the pilot.
Why did we get married, Miles?
Why did we have these children? You don't need us.
Your heart and your mind are in here.
But it doesn't love you like we do.
I'm sorry. Really.
How 'bout spending some time with your other babies?
Hey-hey!
- Raging Wateb!
- Yea!
Wait in the car.
Enrique, estas aqui?
You're pretty jumpy, Connor.
Y tú.
Siempre como culebra.
- Hey! Que bueno verte, Connor.
- Dije que hiba a regresar.
Y yo lo sabia, carajo. Que bueno verte.
Yolanda, venga, que hay visita, carajo.
Traiga la pinche tequila.
- Hey, big John, como te va?
- What's up?
Que grandote es este?
He's cool, Enrique. He's with me.
He's, uh, Uncle Bob.
- Uncle Bob, this is Enrique.
- Uncle Bob, huh?
Okay. Okay.
- Que bonito!
- Como estas?
- Como estas? Que grande estas, mi hijito?
- Drink?
"Uncle Bob"?
Eh, Sarita. You're pretty famous, you know, all over the goddamn TV.
Pictures of you, John, your big friend here.
Cops are going nuts looking for you.
Mihijita, llevese el nino, eh.
I just came for my stuff.
I need clothes, food and one of your trucks.
- How about the fillings out of my fucking teeth?
- Now, Enrique.
- You two, you're on weapons detail.
- Come on, let's go.
One thing about my mom...
...she always plans ahead.
Excellent.
Aw, shit.
You know, this is the best truck I got, but the starter motor's gone.
You got the time to change it out?
- Yeah. I'm gonna wait till dark to cross the border.
- Okay.
Enrique, it's dangerous for you here.
- You get out tonight too. Okay?
- Sure.
Just drop by any time and totally fuck up my life, all right?
See, I grew up in places like this,...
...so I just thought that's how people lived...
...riding around in helicopters,...
...learning how to blow shit up.
But then when my mom got busted I got put in a regular school.
All the other kids were into Nintendo.
- Are you ever afraid?
- No.
- Not even of dying?
- No.
You don't feel any emotion about it one way or another?
No. I have to stay functional until my mission is complete.
Then it doesn't matter.
Yeah. I have to stay functional too.
I'm too important.
That's definitely you.
Most of the guys my mom hung around with were geeks,...
...but there was this one guy, he was kinda cool.
He taught me engines.
Hold here.
Mom screwed it up, ofcourse.
She'd always tell 'em about Judgment Day and me being this world leader.
That'd be all she wrote.
Torque wrench, please.
Here.
I wish I could've met my real dad.
You will.
Yeah, I guess.
When I'm, like, 45, I think.
They sent him back through time to 1984.
Man.
He hasn't even been born yet.
It messes with your head.
- The other bolt.
- Oh. Here.
Mom and him were only together for one night.
She still loves him, I guess.
I see her crying sometimes.
She denies it totally, ofcourse,
like she got something stuck in her eye.
Why do you cry?
- You mean people?
- Yeah.
I don't know.
We just cry, you know, when it hurts.
Pain causes it?
Uh, no.
It's different.
It's when there's nothing wrong with you, but you hurt anyways.
- You get it?
- No.
All right, my man!
No problemo.
Give me five.
Just put out your hand like this.
Come on.
All right! Now hit me. Give me five.
Do the same thing. Do the same thing.
All right--
Okay, that's good, that's good.
Um, up high, up high. Five low.
Too slow.
No. I'm just kidding.
Let's try it one more time.
Good. Now try it.
Good.
Now do me.
Give me five.
Watching John with the machine, it was suddenly so clear.
The Terminator would never stop.
It would never leave him and it would never hurt him,...
...never shout at him or get drunk and hit him...
...or say it was too busy to spend time with him.
It would always be there...
...and it would die to protect him.
Of all the would-be fathers who came and went over the years,...
...this thing, this machine was the only one who measured up.
In an insane world, it was the sanest choice.
Hey, let's try this one.
Hey!
Here we go.
She said you go south with him like you planned.
- She'll meet you tomorrow on the other side.
- Mom!
Mom! Mom, wait!
"No fate."
No fate but what we make.
My father told her this.
I mean,
I made him memorize it in the future as a message to her.
Never mind.
Now--
Okay, the whole thing goes-
The future's not set.
There's no fate but what we make for ourselves.
She intends to change the future.
Yeah, I guess.
Oh, shit!
- Dyson.
- Yeah.
Gotta be. Miles Dyson.
She's gonna blow him away!
Come on! Let's go! Come on!
Let's go, let's go! Come on!
- This is tactically dangerous.
- Drive faster.
The T-1000 has the same files that I do.
It knows what I know.
It might anticipate this move.
I don't care.
We gotta stop her.
Killing Dyson might actually prevent the war.
I don't care!
Haven't you learned anything yet?
Haven't you figured out why you can't kill people?
Look, maybe you don't care if you live or die,
but everybody's not like that.
We have feelings.
We hurt. We're afraid.
You gotta learn this stuff.
I'm not kidding. It's important.
Danny?
Danny, I told you to go to bed like your sister.
Just a couple of minutes, Mom!
Danny, your time is up!
Come brush your teeth and get to bed.
Danny!
Daddy!
Danny,just go! Go!
Danny, go!
- Miles?
- Mom!
- Miles?
- Run! Tarissa, run!
Oh, my God!
Tarissa,just take Danny and go!
Just run! Run!
Oh,Jesus! Miles!
Aah!
- Daddy!
- Danny!
Danny!
Nobody fucking move!
- Don't hurt my daddy!
- Get down on the floor, bitch.
- Get down now!
- Oh, God.
Get out of the way!
Don't hurt him!
Get on the floor!
Fucking down now!
Come on. Come on.
Just-Just let the boy go.
Shut up. Shut up.
Shut up! Shut up!
It's all your fault, motherfucker.
- It's all your fault!
- What?
I'm not gonna let you do it.
Shh.
Shit! We're too late!
Check them.
O-Oh, God.
Look at me, Mom.
Are you hurt?
Look at me.
I almost--
I almost--
It'll be okay, Mom.
It'll be okay.
We'll figure something out.
Okay?
I promise.
You came here to stop me.
Yeah, I did.
I love you,John.
I always have.
I know.
Deep penetration.
No shattered bone.
You hold here.
The pressure should stop the bleeding.
- Who are you people?
- Show him.
Danny, I want you to come with me right now.
Okay? Show me your room.
Oh-- Oh, God! Oh!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God.
Now listen to me very carefully.
Nuclear winter effects caused massive cooling.
Dyson listened while the Terminator laid it all down.
Skynet. Judgment Day.
The history of things to come.
It's not every day that you find out
you're responsible for three billion deaths.
He took it pretty well.
I feel like I'm gonna throw up.
You're judging me on things I haven't even done yet.
How were we supposed to know?
Yeah. Right.
How were you supposed to know?
Fucking men like you built the hydrogen bomb.
Men like you thought it up.
You think you're so creative.
You don't know what it's like to really create something,...
...to create a life, to feel it growing inside you.
- All you know how to create is death and destruction.
- Mom. Mom!
We need to be a little more constructive here.
Okay?
- We still have to stop this from happening, don't we?
- But I thought-
Aren't we changing things, I mean right now,
changing the way it goes?
That's right.
There's no way I'm going to finish the new processor. Not now.
Forget it. I'm out of it.
I'll quit Cyberdyne tomorrow.
That's not good enough.
- No one must follow your work.
- Right.
All right, then, uh,
we have to destroy all the stuff at the lab...
...the files, the disk drives, everything, everything here.
Everything.
I don't care.
The chip.
Do you know about the chip?
- What chip?
- They keep it in a vault at Cyberdyne.
- It must be from the other one like you.
- The C.P.U. from the first Terminator.
Son of a bitch!
I knew it!
- They told us not to ask where they got it.
- Those lying motherfuckers.
It was scary stuff.
Radically advanced.
I mean it was smashed, it didn't work but it gave us ideas,
took us in new directions.
I mean, things we would've never th--
All my work was based on it.
It must be destroyed.
Right.
Can you get us in?
Past security?
I think so, yeah. When?
Now?
The future, always so clear to me,...
...had become like a black highway at night.
We were in uncharted territory now,...
...making up history as we went along.
Hi.
Uh, Carl, right?
Uh, friends from out of town.
I just thought I'd--
Hi. take 'em upstairs and show 'em around.
Mr. Dyson, now you know the rules concerning visitors in the lab.
I need written authorization--
I insist.
Don't even think about it.
Come on. It's okay.
It takes two keys to open the vault.
They have to be turned simultaneously.
The other one is in a locker at the security station.
Gibbons?
Gibbons! Come on, man!
You can't leave the desk like that!
Shit.
Gibbons.
Oh, shit.
Okay.
My card should access this. I--
What?
- What is it?
- Damn it.
The silent alarm's been tripped.
It's neutralized all the codes in the entire building.
Nothing will open anywhere now.
We have to abort.
No.
We go all the way.
Okay?
Okay.
You guys get started on the lab.
I can open this.
- I think it's that guy from the mall.
- It is the guy!
Yeah.
It's him and the woman.
Look just send everything you got in the area right now.
I have a personal entry code for the lab.
It may still work.
It's no good.
Let me try mine.
John, fire in the hole!
Wait! You can't go in there.
The fire set off the Halon system.
You have to wait a few minutes until the gas clears.
Put this on.
All right, let's get to work.
All units in the vicinity and all units able to respond,...
...a 211 in progress at 2144 Kramer Street,
the Cyberdyne building.
Suspect one is white female identified as last name Connor,
first name Sarah.
Escaped last night from Pescadero State Hospital.
Suspect one: White male-
All the discs in my office,
all the discs in that office over there,...
...everything behind my desk and all the processors on my left.
We'll blow those with the C-4.
Can I, um--
Excuse me.
Can I borrow that thing?
I worked a lot of years on this thing.
2111 Kramer.
Suspects are armed and considered extremely dangerous.
Sending the SWAT team.
Over.
All right. 7-2-5-6.
Yes!
Easy money.
Uh-oh.
Oh, shit. Not good.
Not good.
How we doing?
Primer cord is set.
One more barrel, two more minutes.
How do we, how do we set them off?
Remote control.
Piece of cake.
- We got company.
- Police?
- How many?
- All of 'em, I think.
Go. I'll finish here.
Come on.
- I'll take care of the police.
- Hey, wait! You swore!
Trust me.
You at the window!
Drop your weapons and place your hands on top of your head!
Holy shit!
That's a damn mini-gun!
- Come on!
- Oh, shit!
Go! Go! Go! Go!
Son of a bitch!
Go, go! Go! Go!
Fire!
Here we go.
Same time, to the left.
One, two, three, go.
All right, now, in order to get that out you have to just--
We got Skynet by the balls now, don't we?
Come on, let's book.
Hold your fire!
- Ready to rock?
- Ready.
Time to go. Now.
- Take this. They'll use gas.
- Come on.
Get started on the door.
Miles, hand me the detonator.
Mom! Mom!
Shit!
Shit!
She's in the corner, and there's no way outta there.
Get down!
Here.
I don't know how much longer I can hold this.
Fall back!
Everybody out! Fall back now!
Go! Go! Go!
We got a war zone down here!
Shut your eyes.
Stay here. I'll be back.
Get down on the floor!
Face down!
Get onto the floor now!
Okay, drop him!
Aah!
Aah!
God, it hurts!
- Take him out!
- Move out! Move out!
Here, hold this.
Give me a hand!
Holy shit!
Go!
Shit!
Get out.
Listen, no matter what happens, you stay under these vests.
- You got it? All right.
- Yeah.
- Chopper's coming in!
- It's him.
Shit!
John! Stay down!
Mom!
Hello?
Aw, damn! You all right?
Come on, Mom, we gotta get out.
- Take the shotgun.
- Okay.
Are you hurt?
Holy shit. Come on, Mom.
Come on. Come on!
- We need your truck.
- Hurry! Come on.
- Come on. Hurry.
- Get in.
Come on! Go!
What the hell--
- I'm bleeding bad.
- Keep pressure on it.
Here. This'll work.
He's gaining.
- Step on it!
- This is the vehicle's top speed.
I can get out and run faster than this!
He's coming up, to the right.
Watch it! Watch it!
- Drive a minute.
- Where the hell are you going?
Take the off-ramp.
Shit!
Hold on!
Don't stop!
Go straight!
- Look out!
- Duck!
Get the hell outta here!
Get outta here!
Let's go!
Come on! Let's go!
Let's go!
Hasta la vista, baby.
We don't have much time.
Let's go.
Come on! Come on!
We gotta get outta here! Come on! Get up!
Hand me the shotgun.
Put your weight on me, Mom.
Hurry!
Come on, Mom.
Come on, Mom! Get up! Get up! Come on!
This way. Come on.
This way.
All right.
No! Wait!
Wait. No. No.
It's too hot. Go back. Go back.
- Go. Run.
- No! We gotta stick together.
- John.
- John, you've got to go now.
- John!
- Go! Now!
No!
Gotta get up the steps.
Go on.
Get up.
Get up.
Come on, Mom.
I got you. Come on up.
No.
Grab the chain. Grab it.
Grab it. Go. Go!
Mom, come on! Mom! Mom! Come on!
Mom! Mom, come on! Mom!
Call to John.
No.
I know this hurts.
Call John.
Call to John now.
Fuckyou.
John!
Hey! John?
John? Help!
John.
John?
John. John.
John.
- Mom.
- Help me.
Help me.
- Help me.
- Get out of the way, John.
- John. John.
- Shoot!
Mom!
Get down!
Get up. Come on.
Holy shit.
I need a vacation.
Is it dead?
Terminated.
Will this melt in there?
Yes. Throw it in.
Adios.
And the chip.
It's over.
No.
There's one more chip.
And it must be destroyed also.
Here.
I cannot self-terminate.
You must lower me into the steel.
No. No.
- I'm sorry, John. I'm sorry.
- No!
No, it'll be okay.
Stay with us. It'll be okay.
I have to go away. No, don't do it.
Please, don't go.
- I must go away, John.
- No!
No, wait.
- Wait. You don't have to do this.
- Sorry.
No, don't do it!
Don't go!
It has to end here.
I order you not to go.
I order you not to go.
I order you not to go!
I know now why you cry.
But it's something I can never do.
Good-bye.
August 29, 1997, came and went.
Nothing much happened.
Michael Jackson turned 40.
There was no Judgment Day.
People went to work as they always do.
Laughed, complained, watched TV, made love.
I wanted to run through the street yelling,...
...to grab them all and say,
"Every day from this day on is a gift.
Use it well."
Instead, I got drunk.
That was 30 years ago.
But the dark future which never came still exists for me.
And it always will, like the traces of a dream.
John fights the war differently than it was foretold.
Here, on the battlefield of the Senate,...
...his weapons are common sense and hope.
Tie me, Grandma. Tie me!
- How's that?
- Thank you, Grandma.
The luxury of hope was given to me by the Terminator.
Because if a machine can learn the value of human life,...
...maybe we can too.
