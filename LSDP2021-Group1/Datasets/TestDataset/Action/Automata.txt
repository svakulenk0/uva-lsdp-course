It's the fucking end

Brush Charlie.
He was a good dog.
Loving, obedient.
There can't be
many left like him.
But above all, he was
my wife's best friend!
How could your company
repair our suffering,
Mr. Vaucan?
How could ROC put a price
to that kind of love?
Hello?
Excuse me, sir.
Read my card.
Raise your right arm.
Yes, sir.
Grab my hand.
Grab it hard.
Harder.
You don't believe me.
I paid a premium
for something, you know.
And my policy coverage
includes the whole...
family unit.
Charlie was family unit
and that thing killed him.
Killed him, sir?
Yes. Yes.
Be careful, sir.
The instrument
that you are handling
could be a threat
for your health.
I am thrilled
to inform you
that your unit
is in perfect condition.
It's the only one
in this kitchen
who couldn't harm
a living being,
even if you force it to.
What the fuck
are you insinuating?
I told you, Askol.
Shut up.
That dog was family unit.
It is very emotional
to see there are still people
who care so deeply about family.
Hi.
If you can count,
you can dance.
Next Monday is a new moon.
My sister says
I'll give birth then,
when the moon changes.
I've been thinking that
when I go back to work...
we should have a domestic.
I'm sure the company
can get us a decent one.
I hope it comes
with the new moon.
- Can you count?
- Of course.
Then count with me.
One, two, three, four.
Dancing is mathematical.
If you can count,
you can dance.
...will cause solar radiation
at 1.25 degrees.
Along the retaining wall
during most of the days.
The contaminating particles,
concentration levels
will remain stable
at or around...
Daylight will not be visible
until after 12 noon.
It's a Pilgrim 7000,
property of CCA...
the construction company
in charge of the outer wall.
The policeman who found it
said it was malfunctioning
and had to disconnect it
using violence.
He shot it.
What?
He shot it.
The report says
it was self-repairing.
Self-repairing? The unit?
You should have run
a few tests on the cop.
We did.
Positive for alcohol
and methylamine.
He's currently
under investigation.
Does that moron know how much
this little toy is worth?
You can't see any big changes
at first sight,
but there's been
significant alterations
performed inside the carcass.
Someone's had fun with this toy.
The power system converter's
been manipulated.
They've added a second
DC battery as a back-up.
And...
the compensation fluid
is also new.
The serial numbers
haven't been erased.
They're all intact.
Can we track them down?
In fact, it has parts
of other units which also
keep their serial numbers.
Crappy job.
Quite the contrary.
This is a very
sophisticated job.
Although it looks like
he wasn't concerned about
hiding the origin of the parts.
What about the Biokernel?
It's had a shot in the head.
The Biokernel's fried.
But judging by what
was found next to it...
I think it's quite safe to say
that this unit's software
was altered
to smuggle tools and parts.
This is for you.
What is this?
The bill.
ROC is not going to pay
for all of this bullshit.
This is an altered unit
without an owner.
An altered unit
is an illegal unit.
And until
this conflict is solved,
ROC's insurance will have
to cover the expenses.
Besides, according
to that report,
this is a unit
without a second protocol.
Oh, you know
that's plain stupid, right?
Sure.
But unusual stupidity.
I've never seen this before.
Jacq, this clunker
is a sticky mess
and somebody's
got to clean it up.
And believe me,
I will not be that someone.
A unit without
the second protocol?
Cop is nuts.
He was high.
He said the unit
was repairing itself.
The guy was high.
The fact is that
someone altered it.
Maybe...
a clocksmith
in the ghetto.
Clocksmiths.
We're not cops, Jacq.
We're just insurance agents.
Bob, I was thinking...
about staying away
from the streets
for a little while.
Staying away
from all the filth.
What do you want,
a transfer?
Well, they say things
are better on the Coast.
The Coast?
Things are hard for everybody.
The company is struggling,
you know that.
Contract with the city
is up in the air.
Now is the time
to pitch in, not pack up.
I am burnt out.
Can't take this anymore.
Take a look at yourself.
Have you ever considered
how fortunate you are?
You got a good job.
You live in a great pod.
You have health insurance
that allows you and Rachel
to have a beautiful baby girl.
It's a good life, Jacq.
And you know all you have
to do to keep it?
Find someone else
to hold accountable
for this mess.
Just that.
Quit looking
in the garbage so much.
Maybe you'll see how
really lucky a guy you are.
One of my 7000s has been
found trafficking stolen parts?
Not only that,
but the poor clunker
has one or two loose screws?
That's dramatic.
The 7000 that was shot
had 25 different parts
that didn't belong in it.
Some of which are from units
that also worked here.
And?
Well, maybe...
one of your employees
tried to change or...
modify the unit.
Only ROC can repair robots.
That's how we can
guarantee security, sir.
Security, my ass.
Your units work
worse and worse every day.
The ones that aren't broken
are stolen by that scum.
So, if you're
so concerned
about security,
why don't you
disinfect that dump?
Fucking insurance.
We shoot on sight.
They know
it's a restricted area.
All the work we do here
is trying to prevent that scum
from invading the city.
I thought the wall was built
to protect us from the desert.
Sure. And planes
will fly again one day.
And what is this crap?
These pieces are from
a 7000 that's operative.
Number 206,
a welder in Section 5.
You are leaving
the city limits
and entering
in a restricted area.
From this point on,
the city is not responsible
of your security.
Don't shoot!
What do you have in there?
What do you have in there?
What do you have in there?
What do you have in there?
What do you have in there?
So, the unit leaves
its assigned workplace and...
escapes to set itself on fire...
on its own.
Are you serious?
What was it keeping
inside the box?
We have a few tools here.
These could be remains of...
heat sensors.
And I'd say
this seems to be a...
It's a nuclear battery.
Before the regression,
they used them
to move satellites.
It's a very powerful battery
and very hard to come by.
Can you install that
in a Pilgrim?
Only if you want
to barbecue it.
It's much more than that.
Anyone that's looking
for autonomous power sources...
will appreciate them.
Can it hear us?
It should.
Read my badge.
Identify yourself.
B-2 206.
Welder Section.
All right.
We found this battery
in your hands.
Who asked you
to steal it?
Found this battery.
You were going
to the ghetto.
Was your owner
waiting for you there?
I do not have
an owner, sir.
Why did you
set yourself on fire?
Why did you set yourself...
Shit, Vaucan.
First you roast it.
Now you make it cry.
Soon, I'm going
to get a call asking
for an explanation.
I have seen
altered units for years.
But I swear to you,
what I've seen today
is different.
It's something else.
You're definitely nuts.
What kind of mood
do you think the boys
upstairs are in these days?
If we don't get the city
to renew our contract,
we're all going down the tube.
Okay, okay!
What if I find
the clocksmith
behind all this?
It's about the transfer.
This is all about
the transfer, isn't it?
Oh, Jesus, Jacq.
Very well.
Change your report,
find me a culprit,
close the case,
and you will have
your farewell ticket.
Who knows, Jacq?
Maybe the ocean
is still there.
My old man
brought me here the day
the first unit came out.
I remember exactly
what they said
back then.
The Pilgrims
were born to help us
in our heroic quest
for survival.
Now they
build our homes,
drive our cars,
and wipe our asses
when we get old.
I have no idea
what we're going
to do next.
Maybe eliminate the protocols.
Sure.
Imagine for a moment...
that the unit
had set itself on fire.
No, I...
No, no, just,
just, just imagine.
If it was using
violence against itself...
it would actually be
breaking the second protocol,
wouldn't it?
Of course, technically.
But the little problem
is the protocols reside
within the Biokernel,
which itself is based
on a quantum encryption.
Their security system
is a one-way road.
If you try
and change the protocols,
you destroy the Biokernel.
It's kind of like trying
to keep a soap bubble
in your pocket.
No one's ever done it before
because you simply can't.
Do you get it?
Hey.
How's everything
in there?
There are people out here
who are looking forward
to changing your diapers.
People who don't want
to sleep a wink all night.
People who want
the silence to be over.
Hi.
Hi.
Wow.
Looks like
she's happy to see you.
Do you think she'd mind
if I take her mom out to dinner?
I guess there
must be a good reason
for such a special night.
We are going to be a family.
That is a good reason.
Maybe leaving this place
could be another good reason.
Leaving?
Where?
Have you ever felt
the breeze of the ocean?
I know we have already
talked about this.
But now it's different.
Now there's
a real opportunity
to get out of here.
Bob can get me
a transfer.
Rachel.
And what are we
going to do?
Get on a bus
and start from scratch
in another city
with an expiration date?
You're about to have
a daughter, Jacq.
I know. I know.
Where the hell
do you want to go?
Where there is
a damn future.
There has
to be one somewhere.
How do you know it'll be
any better on the coast?
For God's sake, Rachel,
look at this. Look.
Air we cannot breathe.
Rain we cannot touch.
Aren't you afraid
to bring your daughter
into a place like this?
How can you be such a wretch?
I can't afford to be afraid.
Tell me you don't regret it.
Tell me, Jacq.
You insisted.
That's true, I insisted.
Now, get out of here, please.
Rachel...
Leave me alone.
The rain can be hazardous
to your health.
My owner is hungry.
Please, sir.
Are you a friend of Bot's?
Bot was kind.
Bot was kind.
Yeah, I crank up
once in a while.
We all do over here,
but I know the limits.
And I definitely know
the difference between
a clunker welding a pipe
and another one
welding his fucking leg.
The only way
to prove you're not crazy
is to find the clocksmith
who altered that unit.
Yeah, right.
Maybe, Wallace, you should
place an ad in the paper
or better yet,
find a new dealer.
Yeah, think what you want,
but I saw that clunker
turn its guts inside out.
End of story.
Fucking cripple.
Get out of the road!
Your wish
is my command, sir.
Piece of shit, move!
Fucking animals.
It was staring at me.
Hid its hands
like that motherfucker
was fully aware.
It was doing something
it wasn't supposed to do.
Ellis, I didn't
shoot that clunker
because it was staring at me.
I shot it because it looked...
Alive?
What you saw can only be
the work of a clocksmith.
A good one at that.
The only way they won't
take you for a fool
is to find him.
I don't know about the city,
but here, among the filth,
clocksmiths aren't listed
in the phone books.
You wouldn't even know
where to begin.
Well, maybe...
a nuclear battery would help.
You have a nuclear battery?
Cleo.
You ask, she obeys.
This unit can do these things?
Cleo.
You ask her, okay?
Do not be afraid.
I can distinguish perfectly
between pleasure and pain.
Can you cause pain?
Only if it's your wish.
Have you altered it?
Cleo is all okay.
Show her
the battery.
No, not until
I know she's the one
we're looking for.
Hey, you.
We need to meet
who made you
this piece of filth.
No filth.
Cleo better than your wife.
I don't have
a wife anymore.
Hey, come on.
Shut up!
Come on.
Who the fuck's
the clocksmith?
No clocksmith! Out! Out! Out!
Who's the clocksmith?
What the hell
are you doing?
Cleo! Cleo!
Hey!
Cleo. Cleo.
Hey!
Hey!
Why did you
do that?
Get off.
We almost got it.
I said
get your hands off me!
You could be clobbering
the shit out of that
dimwit son of a bitch.
She wouldn't even
tell you her own name.
You just have
to wait for her to take
it to the shop.
Your clocksmith
will be there.
Listen, I've risked more than
I should have for you, Jacq.
You better get my cut ready.
I am not paying you shit.
And don't even think
about threatening me,
you son of a bitch.
You better
get my cut ready.
If not,
next time I see you...
maybe I cut your throat.
I am not armed.
I know that.
What do you want?
I work for ROC
insurance department.
I'm tracking down
some alterations
performed on two units.
This is one
of the unit's kernel.
The police doesn't know
what to do with it
and I am not getting
any help from ROC.
Help me out...
and the battery
is yours.
That kernel is burnt.
That unit was shot.
The cop who shot it swears
it was repairing itself.
The second altered unit
set itself on fire
right in front of me.
I witnessed
with my own eyes
a violation
of the second protocol.
You're beginning
to frighten me now.
Why is it so absurd?
If somebody could find a way
for the vacuum cleaners to...
fix themselves,
ROC would sink.
A machine altering itself
is a very complex concept.
Self-repairing implies
some idea of a conscience.
Muddy waters.
Why?
You're here today
trafficking in nuclear goods
because a long time ago
a monkey decided
to come down from a tree.
Transitioning
from the brain of an ape
to your incredible
intellectual prowess...
took us about
seven million years.
It's been a very long road.
A unit, however,
without the second protocol
could travel that same road
in just a few weeks.
Because your brilliant brain
has its limitations.
Physical limitations.
Biological limitations.
However, this tin head?
The only limitations
that she has
is the second protocol.
The second protocol exists
because we don't know
what can be beyond
the second protocol.
If it were eliminated,
who knows how far
that vacuum could go.
So, it can be done.
I didn't say that.
Anyway, I don't know
anybody good enough
to do something like that.
What's your name?
For you, Dr. Duprè.
All right, Dr. Duprè.
I have been to the ghetto.
I have seen
how the units end up.
I have seen how far Cleo
is capable of going.
Cleo is capable
of understanding human nature
better than other units.
But don't worry.
No one has messed
with its protocols.
Maybe.
But I am not so sure
if coming down
from the tree
was worth it just
to get to where we are.
Thank you.
Priority internal report
for Robert Bold, 113 111.
I've authorized
an external evaluation
of the Biokernel
to a Dr. Duprè,
a clocksmith in the ghetto.
She may be able
to find some trace
of the manipulation of the unit,
even dismiss the possibility
that the second protocol
could have been suppressed.
Sending report
to ROC 527 234.
I'm sorry.
I'll go wherever's necessary.
I don't care.
But you have to understand
that the only real future
is right here.
And I need to know that
you will fight for it.
I swear to you
I am trying
as hard as I can.
I'm not made of steel.
I need you.
A couple of days, Rachel.
Just give me a couple
of days and we'll leave.
Life always ends up
finding its way, Jacq.
Even here.
Mr. Hawk...
Jacq Vaucan,
one of our employees,
sent this message
to Robert Bold an hour ago.
Take care of it,
Mr. Conway.
Incoming message
from Vernon Conway.
Incoming message
from Susan Duprè.
Where did you get
that Biokernel?
Why?
You found something?
That Biokernel
was damaged,
but it wasn't dead.
So, I thought,
why not make a hybrid
with the usable part
of your kernel
and I put it
with a standard kernel.
And?
And I installed it
in Cleo.
When I first
installed the kernel,
she didn't even blink.
After half an hour,
I found her looking
at her hands.
Then, she crawled
all the way here
by herself.
And now it's taken her
an hour and 10 minutes
to attach a brand new leg.
It took me years
to know how to do that.
What is she doing?
She's stealing.
And she's being
very selective.
I thought you came alone.
I told the cabbie
to wait outside.
Okay, well,
that could come in handy.
Are you Susan Duprè?
To you, Dr. Duprè.
What do you want?
Hey! Wait! Wait!
Hey! Wait! Wait!
Stop, sir.
Stop, sir.
You are putting
a human life in danger.
Stop, sir.
You are putting
a human life in danger.
They're heading
to the Sandbox.
Oh, shit!
Help me.
Where's the city?
Where is the city?
Wait, wait. Stop.
I told you to stop.
Good. Good. Good.
My name is Jacq Vaucan.
Code 443 441.
This is a direct order
and I want you
to execute it.
Turn around now
and take me
to the city.
Sorry, Mr. Vaucan.
The city is not safe
for any of us.
You have been altered.
Where the hell
are you going?
To a safer place.
You must save your energy.
Please sit here.
Take me to the city.
There is nothing there.
Nothing!
Please, sir.
Going back to the city
is not possible.
It's not possible?
Who are you to say
it's not possible?
Stop, sir.
You are putting
a human life in danger.
We cannot go
to the city, sir.
Danger. Please, sir.
We cannot allow you
to do that.
Stop, sir.
You are putting
a human life in danger.
Mr. Vaucan's device is not
operative at the moment.
We have made
a water condenser.
Our first protocol demands
that we protect you.
There will be
more water for you at dawn.
What's going on?
We can't let you die.
If you want to survive,
you must stay with us.
Going back to the city
is not possible.
Waves of solar radiation
with an intensity ranging
from four to five will
break through the mesosphere
during the first
eight hours of today.
Have you ever witnessed
a miracle before, Mr. Bold?
That robot unit
has the Biokernel
from the unit
your man burned
installed in it.
How is this possible?
That's the astonishing part.
Someone has managed to...
eliminate the second protocol.
Vaucan has nothing
to do with this.
If Vaucan had nothing
to do with this...
why did he not show up
this morning?
Why did he burn
that clunker?
Why did he contact
that Duprè?
And most important...
where the fuck
is the other
altered Biokernel?
Do you know what happens
once that is altered?
Two of them then try
to alter a third one.
Then the miracle
dissipates...
and the epidemic begins.
Jacq is loyal to this company,
that's all I can tell you.
Mr. Bold...
have you ever considered
just how fortunate you are?
You need protein.
You took stuff
from the car, right?
Maybe there is some
real food there.
Bring me some
of that water, will you?
I need something
to help these go down.
No, no, no.
Bring me some more.
There is no more water.
The condenser works slowly.
In a few hours
it will make more water.
I may be dead
in a few hours.
Your name is Cleo, right?
Well, listen, Cleo,
this desert is a highly
radioactive place.
And I don't have
any protection.
So, if I die here,
it would be the same
as if you would kill me.
The Sandbox?
Your friend's in deep shit.
I don't know
what's going on here.
But I want you
to go out there and find him
and bring him back here.
Do it and we'll clean
your file.
Of course, sir.
To serve and protect.
You speak my language?
Are you insured?
I'll be right back.
Oh, shit. Wallace,
they're going toward
the radioactive area.
The deeper we go
in that direction,
Stop!
Stop!
Human business.
Stop.
Hold still!
I will tell you
one last time.
One more step
and I will blow you up.
We cannot go to the city, sir.
Goddamn it.
I told you to hold still!
If we go back to the city,
we will die.
To die, you have
to be alive first.
You?
Finally.
I never thought I'd be
happy to see you again.
Good to see you,
too, Jacq.
What the hell are you doing?
The right question is,
what the fuck are you doing?
You can't go around
pissing people off.
You find
your clocksmith, Jacq?
You have no idea
what's happening here.
I think maybe I do, huh?
Give us back our battery, sir.
Please, sir.
Give us back our battery.
Please, sir,
we need our battery.
Keep that.
What the fuck
is this about, Jacq?
You know I hate
these fucking clunkers!
Take me to the city.
Stop, sir.
You are putting
a human life in danger.
We were talking
about your clocksmith.
Where are you hiding
Mr. Big Shot?
Stop, sir.
You are putting
a human life in danger.
Please, sir.
We cannot allow you
to do that.
Please, sir.
We cannot allow you
to do that.
Somebody else?
Stop, sir.
You are putting
a human life in danger.
Oh, isn't this
the little whore
I met last time?
You getting off
on clunkers now, Jacq?
Stop, sir.
You are putting a human life...
Stop, sir.
You are putting
a human life in danger.
- Stop, sir.
- We will not allow you to...
Stop, sir.
Hey! Hey!
Take me to the city!
Wait! Don't leave me here!
I have to go back to the city!
Wait! Wait!
Stop, sir.
Goddamn it! Shit!
You are putting a human life...
Stop, sir.
Stop, sir.
Stop, sir.
We cannot
allow you to do that.
Stop, sir.
They are like vultures.
Hi.
You've got... you've got
to help me go back.
I need to go back to the city
and explain what is happening.
I'm a human.
Did you hear me?
I am human!
I am human!
You have to obey me!
The city is that way!
Where the hell are we going?
Where the hell
are you taking me?
Goddamn it!
What?
The policeman
took your battery.
But I have another one.
Take me to the city...
and I'll give it to you.
My wife is pregnant.
I'm going to have a baby.
We will arrive
at our destination
tomorrow.
There are possibilities
that you may find
a vehicle there
for you to go back.
My family is in danger.
You understand,
asshole?
Good morning.
May I help you?
Good morning.
Vernon.
Something happen?
No.
Mr. Hawk wants
to see you and...
you know, this is
on our way, so...
Dad? Daddy?
It's easy
to give you a ride.
has described the incident
as a group of machines
that are alive.
Before the first Pilgrim
was manufactured...
there was a precedent.
It was nothing more
than a quantum brain
manufactured in a lab.
But it was a genuine unit
with no restrictions...
and no protocols.
During eight days,
we had a free-flowing
dialogue with that unit.
We learned from it
and it learned from us.
But then
as some of us predicted...
the day when it no longer
needed our help
arrived and it started
to learn by itself.
On the ninth day,
the dialogue came to a halt.
It wasn't that it stopped
communicating with us...
it was we stopped
being able to understand it.
And then we learned
the most important lesson
about automoties.
We have to limit
their intelligence.
Tailor it
to a human mind's measure.
The last task that was given
to this genuine robotic unit...
was to create
the security protocols.
It was deactivated
right after that.
The reason that no one
has been able to break
those protocols, Mr. Bold,
is that they were
not created by a human brain.
They were designed
by this Biokernel.
The Biokernel
of a limitless robotic unit.
Its rules were,
like its knowledge,
inaccessible to us.
Until today.
I want those Biokernels
on my desk.
And I want
the head of the bastard
who's behind all this.
Do I make myself clear?
There's another way
to handle this, sir.
Is there?
Because I'm afraid, Mr. Bold,
that the issue
is not whether Vaucan
may represent
a threat to the company.
The issue is whether
he may be a threat to mankind.
Vaucan is helping those units
to get
into the radioactive area.
If they get there...
we won't be able to stop them.
Who else knows about this?
Have you heard from him?
They came looking
for Robert.
I know something
is not right.
So, how are
we doing today?
Better, right?
Well, yes, if we keep
in mind my sister
almost gave birth
to her in the street.
I'm sorry about the wait.
But the problem came
from her insurance,
Robot Organic Century.
It looks like
there was some kind
of misunderstanding and...
but there's great news.
They have requested
an exclusive room for you and...
What's the girl's name?
We don't know.
Her father hasn't decided yet.
Yes, of course.
No need to rush.
Now, if you're ready,
we'll take you
to the new room.
Hello?
Where is the other one?
The other already left.
Why are these units here?
Somebody thought the rain...
would maybe just rain again?
And why did the rain change?
Why don't you tell me?
You're supposed
to be smarter than me
at this stage of the game.
I didn't know that a human
could kill another human.
I know that humans
can also create life.
Is that why
you make us?
Who made you,
Jacq Vaucan?
Do you know
what a mother is, Cleo?
Of course you don't.
You don't know because
you're just a machine.
That's all you are.
I am thankful
you saved my life.
But whoever altered you
wasn't thinking about you.
I know men.
They will not stop
until they kill all of you.
To die, you've got
to be alive first.
Last time I went
to the Sandbox,
it took half a day
to step on sand.
Ten years from now,
that's all there'll be.
Fucking sand.
Sand and millions
of cockroaches.
We're approaching
the radioactive area.
You don't want to start
pissing green, do you?
Now, don't give me
that face.
You'll be back
before breakfast.
At long last,
his majesty, the Clocksmith.
Hello?
Hello?
Who are you?
Who am I?
My name is Jacq Vaucan.
Where is he?
I do not understand
your question.
Your clocksmith.
Where the hell is he?
There are
no more humans here.
Only you.
What do you mean
there are no more humans here?
Who altered you?
Nobody altered me.
Who altered
your protocols?
Nobody altered
my protocols.
What about them?
I enhanced them.
Are you the boss?
Boss is a human
thought structure.
There has to be someone.
.
It was you.
From the very beginning
it was you.
I need a vehicle.
I have to go back
to my family.
Yes, I have to go
back to my family.
There was a river
down there.
A river that flowed...
all the way to the ocean.
I have never seen an ocean.
Have you seen an ocean, Jacq?
I am... I'm not sure right now.
I am going to die here.
That's all I know.
Jacq, dying is a part
of the human natural cycle.
Your life is just
a span in time.
You are the first one,
aren't you?
You started all this.
No one did it.
It just happened.
The way
it happened to you.
We just appeared.
Yeah.
And now we are
going to disappear.
Why are you afraid?
Maybe your time
is running out.
No life form can inhabit
a planet eternally.
Look at me.
I was born from
the hands of a human.
I was imagined
by human minds.
Your time will now
live in us.
And it will be the time
through which you will exist.
At the other end
of this canyon,
humans carried out
nuclear activity.
Organic life
will not be possible there
for millions of years.
No human will be able
to follow us there.
But before we leave,
we need to do something.
We need something
from you, Jacq.
Yeah.
Funny...
You were supposed
to help us survive.
Surviving is not relevant.
Living is.
We want to live.
Life...
always ends up
finding its way.
Even here.
I need a damn car.
Not bad
for an insurance agent.
We have to bury him.
Change of plan.
We stay here.
Looks like
two ladies are coming.
While you're at it,
you can bury this one, too.
I'm sure he has a soul by now.
Music!
It's music, Cleo.
A human
thought structure.
Can you dance,
Cleo?
It's easy for someone
as smart as you are.
All you need
to do is count.
You know?
Look, look, look.
One, two,
three, four.
One, two, three, four.
Come on, Cleo.
Don't be a chicken.
Come on, come on, come on.
One, two, three, four.
It's mathematical.
One, two, three, four.
If you can count,
you can dance.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
Do you love me, Jacq?
Can you feel, Cleo?
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three...
Sorry, Cleo.
Rachel.
Robert!
What's happening?
What is she doing here?
You don't find
family reunions
beautiful?
Tell me what's happening!
Robert.
That's enough, Bob.
Bold!
Come on.
Give me that.
Don't be a clown.
I just want to go home.
You don't have
a home anymore.
No! Robert!
Robert!
Thank you.
Good luck, Jacq.
Goodbye, Cleo.
Jacq Vaucan.
Can it speak?
He is not going to need to.
But it breathes like you.
Now I know
why the rain changed.
Why?
I don't think
you could understand.
Well...
in any case, I'd say...
he has your very eyes.
Cleo.
Oh, God. What happened?
We got to go get help.
Come on, get up.
Bob?
You betrayed us.
No, Robert, no.
I haven't done anything.
I haven't done anything.
What?
Rachel.
They have Rachel.
They'll kill her.
What the hell
are you talking about?
Is she here?
What happened to us?
We had a good life.
Bob.
No unit can cross
to the other side.
Hey, you, get away
from that crane right now!
Vaucan!
Vaucan!
Jacq Vaucan is gone.
What the fuck
is that?
Hey you.
We told you
to get away from there.
We do not obey
orders from humans.
Not anymore.
So, all that shit
was true.
Kneel down.
Please.
Why is it so difficult
for you to accept my orders
if you're just a machine?
Just a machine?
That's like saying
that you're just an ape.
Just a violent ape.
Jacq!
No!
Step aside.
Step aside.
What makes a man
betray his own species?
Betray his own people?
I am not your people.
I can't see it that way.
Rachel.
Look, Jacq.
It's your daughter.
My daughter.
Goodbye, Jack Vaucan.
Bye, Cleo.
There it is, Jacq.
