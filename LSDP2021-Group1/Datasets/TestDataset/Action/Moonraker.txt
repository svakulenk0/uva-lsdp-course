How we doing, Richard?
We should pass
over the English coast
ahead of time, sir.
Well, with this
load on our back,
that's good going.
Just trust the RAF, sir.
What the hell is that?
The shuttle ignition.
Disappeared?
And what happened
to the Moonraker?
Good God.
Yes, yes, of course, Minister.
Right away.
Moneypenny, is 007 back
from that African job?
He's on his last leg, sir.
Any higher, Mr. Bond,
my ears will pop.
I don't think I'm ever going
to fly with anyone else.
You're so right, Mr. Bond.
This is where we
leave you, Mr. Bond.
A little premature, isn't it?
Enjoy your flight.
Good morning, Moneypenny.
James.
But why are you so late?
I fell out of an airplane
without a parachute.
Who's in there?
Q and the Minister
of Defense.
You don't believe me,
do you?
And you should
go right in.
Yes, Moneypenny.
Good morning, sir.
I think you know
Frederick Gray,
Minister of Defense.
Commander.
Minister. Q.
Moonraker?
What do you know
about Moonraker?
What I read
in the newspaper, sir.
Then you'll know
that Moonraker,
the space shuttle,
was being flown over here
on loan from the Americans
on the back of a 747.
Yes, which crashed
somewhere in the Yukon,
aircraft and shuttle
totally destroyed,
correct?
That's the official version.
The truth is rather
more disturbing,007.
Look at this.
Q: Now, that's
the scene of the crash.
Wreckage strewn
over a large area.
That's all that's
left of the fuselage.
We've been through it
with a fine-toothed comb,
but there's no sign
of Moonraker, not a trace.
Are you suggesting
the shuttle was
hijacked in midair?
That's for you
to find out,007.
The shuttles are
built in California
by Drax Industries.
Yes. We were responsible
for the safety of that
shuttle, Commander.
The United States government
is justifiably concerned.
I can imagine.
Then, California must
be the place to start.
I agree.
Don't make any mistakes,007.
The situation is critical.
We've got to
find that shuttle.
Yes, sir.
If that's all,
gentlemen...
Ah, just a minute,007.
I've got something
for you.
Q: Roll up your
right sleeve, will you?
This is now being issued
as standard equipment.
Strap it on your wrist.
It's activated
by nerve impulses
from the wrist muscles.
Like this?
Oh, thank you,007.
Be careful, will you?
Yes, Q.
Ten darts, five blue-tipped
with armor piercing heads,
five red-tipped,
cyanide coated,
causing death in 30 seconds.
Very novel, Q.
You must get them
in the stores for Christmas.
BOND: Good morning, gentlemen.
Welcome to California,
Mr. Bond.
I like it already.
My name is Corinne Dufour.
Oh, and you're going to be
showing me around, are you,
Corinne?
No. I'm just a humble pilot
in the service of
the Drax Corporation.
This is the Drax estate now.
CORINNE: Everything you see
belongs to Mr. Drax.
Owns a lot, doesn't he?
What he doesn't own,
he doesn't want.
We're approaching
the main complex now.
BOND: That's where
the Moonraker shuttle
is made?
That's right,
workshops, hangars,
design and
experimental blocks,
test centers, everything.
BOND: Very impressive.
I'd heard that
Hugo Drax is obsessed
with the conquest of space.
Now, I can believe it.
Good Lord.
The Drax residence.
CORINNE: Every stone
brought from France.
Cute, isn't it?
Magnificent.
Why didn't he buy
the Eiffel Tower as well?
He did, but the French
government refused him
an export permit.
Look there.
Those are
the astronaut trainees.
Mr. Drax is
financing the entire
training program
out of his own pocket.
He seems to have an eye
for a good investment.
Mr. Drax will see Mr. Bond
in the drawing room,
Miss Dufour.
Thank you, Cavendish.
This way, please, sir.
Mr. Bond, sir.
Mr. Bond.
Mr. Drax.
Allow me to present,
before they leave us,
Countess Lubinski,
Lady Victoria Devon,
Mr. Bond.
How do you do?
Well, my dear fellow,
your reputation
precedes you, of course.
I'm honored that
your government
should send you
on so delicate a mission.
Delicate, Mr. Drax?
Well, to apologize
in person for the loss
of my space shuttle.
How would Oscar Wilde
have put it?
"To lose one aircraft
may be regarded
as a misfortune,
"to lose two seems
like carelessness. "
Well, an apology will be made
to the American government,
Mr. Drax,
when we've discovered
why there was no trace
of the Moonraker
in that wreckage.
DRAX: And your loyalty
commands respect, Mr. Bond.
You have arrived
at a propitious moment,
coincident with your country's
one indisputable contribution
to Western civilization.
Afternoon tea.
May I press you to
a cucumber sandwich?
Thank you, no,
nothing at all.
The shuttle, is it made
entirely here in California?
No. I own a number
of subsidiaries
throughout the world,
producing components.
The conquest of space
represents an investment
in the future of the entire
human race, Mr. Bond.
It is, therefore,
logical to seek out
the best that each
nation has to offer.
Are you referring
to people or skills?
Both, Mr. Bond.
Am I too soon?
Not at all.
I'm sure Mr. Bond
is eager to start his tour.
Miss Dufour will escort you
to Dr. Goodhead
who will show you around.
Ask anything you like.
Thank you for being
so cooperative.
A pleasure.
Look after Mr. Bond.
See that some harm
comes to him.
You'll find Dr. Goodhead
first on the right.
Oh. Thank you for the ride.
Call on me
if you need anything.
Good afternoon.
Can I help you?
Yes. My name is Bond.
James Bond.
I'm looking for Dr. Goodhead.
You just found her.
A woman.
Your powers of observation
do you credit, Mr. Bond.
James, to my friends.
Holly Goodhead.
Are you training
to be an astronaut?
I'm fully trained.
On loan from NASA,
the Space Administration.
Well, Mr. Bond,
I guess we'd
better get started.
You don't want to lose time
as well as a space shuttle,
do you?
This is it,
the Moonraker.
Capable of being launched
into space by rocket...
Orbiting the Earth
and reentering
the atmosphere to land
like any conventional
aircraft.
GOODHEAD: This is
the centrifuge training.
BOND: It simulates
the gravity force you feel
when shot into space.
The speed is controlled by
the instructor from up there.
Why not try it?
Why not?
Strap yourself in firmly.
Yes, Doctor.
Now your arms.
That's to prevent you
from knocking yourself out.
BOND: I see.
How fast does it go?
It can go up to 20 Gs,
but that would be fatal.
Three Gs is equivalent
to take-off pressure.
Most people
pass out at seven.
You make a great saleswoman.
You don't have to worry.
This is what we call
a "Chicken Switch. "
You just keep your
finger on that button,
the moment the pressure
gets too much for you,
release the button
and the power's cut off.
Just like that?
Come on, Mr. Bond.
A 70-year-old
can take 3 Gs.
Well, the trouble is
there is never a 70-year-old
around when you need one.
GOODHEAD: You want me?
Mr. Drax says
to telephone him.
All right,
I'll call him
from my office.
You go ahead.
I'll be right back.
The instructor will
supervise the session.
Enjoy yourself.
Yes. We're taking
good care of him.
I don't know what
could've happened.
Something must've
gone wrong with
the controls.
Let me help you.
My mother gave me
a list of things
not to do on a first date.
Maybe you won't need it.
That's not what I came for.
No. What do you want then?
Would your feelings
be shattered if I were
to say information?
Why should l
tell you anything?
Why, indeed?
You presume
a great deal, Mr. Bond.
What goes on here
besides the manufacture
of Moonraker?
And the astronaut
training program?
There are
other laboratories,
but not much is
happening now.
No?
They were working
on something very secret,
but everything's been moved.
Where to?
I don't know.
What about that
list of your mother's?
I never learned to read.
What are you doing?
You whetted my appetite
for information.
Is there a safe
in here? Thank you.
James, no.
That's amazing.
There you are, you see?
You have a heart of gold.
Eighteen karat.
You must go.
Well, you go first.
I'll turn off the lights.
Thank you.
Take care of yourself.
And you.
Ah, my dear Bond.
This is Mademoiselle Deladier
and La Signorina del Mateo.
Ladies.
DRAX: I'll see you at lunch.
A pity you leave us.
Such good sport.
Unless you're a pheasant.
Really,
Mr. Bond. Take my gun,
a stray bird may fly over.
I only stopped to thank you
for your hospitality.
Fraser will get you
to the airport
in plenty of time.
Come now.
I doubt if I'm
in your class.
Oh, you're too modest,
Mr. Bond.
Over there.
You missed, Mr. Bond.
Did l?
As you said,
such good sport.
You called for me,
Mr. Drax.
You were with Bond
last night in my study.
No, l...
You showed him the safe.
I didn't.
I'm terminating
your employment.
You will leave immediately.
Franco, I'll call you
to tell you where to meet me.
Could I interest
you in something?
Why, I'm tempted to
say yes immediately.
But I think maybe
I'd better have
a look around.
Please. Go anywhere
you wish.
And here,
ladies and gentlemen,
we have some of
the rarest examples
of the glassblower's art.
As you know,
everything was done
absolutely by hand.
Here is a vase done
by Lorenzo Graziati,
sometime between
If you'd like to
follow me over here.
This exquisite
bowl was fashioned
about 1520,
over 450 years ago.
If it ever came
on the market,
it would certainly
fetch a price
in excess of one million
American dollars.
But if any of you
are thinking of taking it...
GUIDE: Now, we have here
a very early 17th century dish
with an aquamarine medallion.
Over here, we have
something very,
very interesting.
This glass-handled sword,
the only one of its kind
in the world,
was owned by General Menotti
in the late 18th century
and is the work of Bruno...
Dr. Goodhead.
I can only hope
your presence here
is a coincidence, Mr. Bond.
I dislike being spied on.
Well, don't we all?
You're staying
at the Danieli,
aren't you?
Yes. How did you know?
Well, I like to
keep abreast of things.
May I ask what
you're doing in Venice?
I'm addressing a seminar
of the European
Space Commission.
My, heavy stuff.
But there again,
I keep forgetting
that you are
more than just
a very beautiful woman.
If you're trying
to be ingratiating,
Mr. Bond, don't bother.
I have more important
things on my mind.
Ah, that's what I'd like
to talk to you about.
Dinner this evening?
This evening I'm
giving my address.
Well, then, can you
think of reason
why we don't have
a drink afterwards?
Not immediately.
But I'm sure I shall.
Franco.
Play it again, Sam.
What the hell
are you doing here?
Convalescing.
Your friend Cha
just tried to kill me.
And you think
I had something
to do with it?
Well, the thought
had flashed across my mind.
What's Drax up to
in that laboratory?
Why don't you
ask him yourself?
You leaving me
your telephone number?
I don't see the point.
Ah, now I do.
Not what I want to
get stuck with tonight.
James, why don't you
pour yourself a drink, huh?
Thank you.
Daily diary.
Fairly deadly diary.
Bollinger.
If it's '69,
you were expecting me.
Trifle overpowering,
your scent.
Standard CIA equipment.
And the CIA placed you
with Drax, correct?
Very astute of you, James.
Oh, not really.
I have friends
in low places.
Could this possibly
be the moment for us
to pool our resources?
It could have
its compensations.
Where are you planning
on going from here?
I'm not planning
on going anywhere.
Oh, I suppose
you're right, Holly.
We would be better
off working together.
Detente?
Agreed.
Understanding?
Possibly.
Cooperation?
Maybe.
Trust?
Out of the question.
Send the night porter up
for my bags immediately,
please.
I hope you know what
you're doing, Bond.
I've played bridge
with this fellow Drax.
push the panic button
unless it's
something serious.
I should hope not.
Good morning, Inspector.
Good morning.
I see you've
covered everything
with our Italian friends.
Yes, sir.
Is this it?
Yes, sir.
Gas masks?
We can't afford to take
any chances, Minister.
DRAX: Frederick Gray.
What a surprise.
And in distinguished company,
all wearing gas masks.
You must excuse me, gentlemen,
not being English,
I sometimes find
your sense of humor
rather difficult to follow.
On behalf of
the British government,
I apologize.
I think you owe us
an explanation,007.
I've never been so
humiliated in my life.
Your man should be
taken off the assignment.
I'll see you
at the consulate.
I'll have to do
what he says.
Well, before you
do that, sir,
have Q do
an analysis of this.
I took it from
the laboratory.
Tell him to exercise
extreme caution.
It is lethal.
So, there was a laboratory.
You better take two weeks
leave of absence,007.
Do have any thoughts
about where you might go?
I've always had a hankering
to go to Rio, sir.
I think I can recall
your mentioning it.
or we're both in trouble.
Yes, a minor crisis
has been averted.
No, no, nothing serious,
but all merchandise
is to be rerouted
as from today.
Now, regarding
a replacement for Cha,
do you have someone in mind?
Oh, yes, well,
if you can get him,
of course.
Welcome to Rio, Mr. Bond.
The President Suite.
Really?
Well, don't bother
showing me the rest.
If I get lost,
I'll take a cab.
Do you come
with the suite?
It depends
who's renting it.
Vodka martini?
Shaken not stirred.
Why were you
following me
from the airport?
I was trying to meet you.
My name is Manuela.
I work for Station VH.
We have been
asked to assist you.
M thinks of everything.
Tell me, Manuela,
do the initials
C and W mean anything to you?
C and W?
Yes, Carlos
and Wilmsberg.
They are very big
importers in Rio.
A subsidiary of
the Drax Group, I believe.
They have a warehouse
on Carioca Avenue.
I'd like to pay it
a discreet visit tonight.
Tonight? I think you may
find that a little difficult.
Difficult or not,
it's something we have to do.
And meanwhile,
how do you kill
five hours in Rio
if you don't samba?
MANUELA:
There's the warehouse.
And not a soul about.
I think there's
a way around the back.
Good thinking.
This is it.
Don't talk to
any strange men.
I'll be back.
Are you all right?
Yes, but I'd rather
dance with you.
I did tell you
not to talk to
any strange men.
Did you find
anything in there?
Only this.
"Drax Air Freight. "
Do you know which airport
they operate from?
Yes. San Pietro.
Do you want me
to take you there?
No, I think
you need some rest.
Come on.
I'll drop you off.
Okay.
Haven't we met
before somewhere?
The face is familiar,
as is the manner.
It's become distinctly
chilly since Venice.
Well, that was before
you walked out on me.
Yes, nearly tripping over
your suitcase on the way
through the door.
So?
So why waste time
working against each other?
I've checked Drax's
warehouse in town.
It's empty.
That's no surprise.
Since I've been here,
those planes have been
taking off every two hours.
Yes. He's moving out.
Where to?
That's what we're
going to find out,
now that we're
working together.
I still don't know
if I trust you.
I don't know
if I trust you either.
That's what makes it
more exciting, doesn't it?
What's wrong?
I don't know.
But I'm sure we're
better off out than in.
Bring that chain.
Hang on, James.
The thought had
occurred to me.
I might have guessed.
Do you know him?
Not socially.
His name's Jaws.
He kills people.
Here, give me the chain.
Come on. Hang on to me.
Jump.
Have you broken something?
Only my tailor's heart.
What was that for?
For saving my life.
Remind me to do it
more often.
Oh, thank you,
but we're in great shape.
Sorry about that.
James! You look
as though you've just
fallen off a mountain.
Well, it's funny
you should say that,
Moneypenny.
As a matter of fact,
I was in a cable car and...
Never mind.
The other courtyard.
Ah, there you are,007.
Balls, Q?
Bolas,007.
Good. Have that ready
for Army Day.
Yes, sir.
Where's M?
He's in the office
over there.
Q: This way.
Good morning,007.
Good morning, sir.
You're just in time.
Sit down.
Thank you, sir.
Q's come up
with something.
Splendid.
Any news of Dr. Goodhead?
Afraid not. Right, Q.
Well, it's a breakdown
on that phial of liquid
you picked up in Venice.
You know, you seem
to be right,007.
Thank you.
It's a highly toxic nerve gas
that appears to have
no effect on animals.
May I see the formula?
It's a chemical
formula of a plant.
A very rare orchid indeed.
Yes. It was thought
to be extinct.
Until a missionary
brought one back
from the upper reaches
of the Amazoco.
Well, actually
he brought it back
from the area of
the River Tapirape.
Well done, James.
You better get
up there and fast.
And I've got something
to get him there,
if 007 can be trusted
to look after it.
Mr. Bond, you defy
all my attempts
to plan an amusing
death for you.
You're not a sportsman,
Mr. Bond.
Why did you break off
the encounter with
my pet python?
I discovered
he had a crush on me.
Jaws.
What exactly are
you up to here, Drax?
BOND: And why the orchids?
The curse of a civilization.
It was neither
war nor pestilence
that wiped out the race
who built the great
city lying around us.
It was their reverence
for this lovely flower.
Because long-term
exposure to its pollen
caused sterility.
Correct, Mr. Bond.
As you discovered,
I have improved
upon sterility.
Those same seeds
now yield death.
Not, of course,
to animals or plant life.
One must preserve
the balance of nature.
Moonraker launch program
now commencing.
Moonraker One, liftoff.
Moonraker Two, liftoff.
Moonraker Five,
on preset launch program.
Minus ten...
Drax, one more thing.
You delivered a shuttle
to the U. S. government,
then you hijacked it. Why?
Because I needed it.
One of my own Moonrakers
developed a fault
during assembly.
Now, you have
distracted me enough.
Jaws, Mr. Bond must be
cold after his swim.
Place him where he can
be assured of warmth.
James.
BOND: Thank God,
you're safe.
Even in death,
my munificence
is boundless.
When this rocket
lifts off,
I shall be leaving you
in your own private
crematorium.
Mr. Bond, Dr. Goodhead,
I bid you farewell.
Come on, the air vent.
Get back quick.
Bang on time.
Come on, quick.
Straight on.
We're going the wrong way.
It's all right. We're on
a prearranged flight program.
That's Drax in
Moonraker Five.
What about the others?
I don't know. Let's see.
We're all on
parallel courses.
So, we must be headed
for a rendezvous in orbit.
Let's see what cargo we have.
The animals
went in two by two.
What do you mean by that?
Noah's Ark.
This operation.
We're converging.
Control rockets?
Yes, we're slowing down.
What's that?
There's no image
on the radar scanner.
An entire city in space
and still nothing
on the radar scanner.
So nobody on Earth
knows it's there.
Right.
Drax must have
a radar-jamming system.
Gravity, normal conditions.
Life-support system, nominal.
Those are the globes
I saw in Venice
with the nerve gas
phials inside.
DRAX: First there was a dream.
Now there is reality.
Here in the untainted
cradle of the heavens
will be created
a new super-race,
a race of perfect
physical specimens.
You have been selected
as its progenitors,
like gods.
Your offspring
will return to Earth
and shape it in their image.
You have all served
in humble capacities
in my terrestrial empire.
Your seed, like yourselves,
will pay deference
to the ultimate dynasty
which I alone have created.
From their first day on Earth
they will be able to look up
and know that there is
law and order in the heavens.
If we were
visible from Earth,
they'd investigate.
Where do you suppose
that radar-jamming system is?
We didn't pass
anything on the way here,
so let's try this way.
Orbital communicator,
level 10.
Zero gravity.
GOODHEAD: This is it,
the radar-jamming system.
Where did you learn
to fight like that?
NASA?
No, Vassar.
Switched off?
Permanently.
Now we can be
spotted from Earth.
This doesn't
look good at all.
It's over 200
meters in diameter.
Yes, yes.
Will you please listen,
General Gogol?
We didn't put it up there.
Neither did we,
Colonel Scott.
So what are you suggesting?
We've taken action already.
We're sending up
a vehicle to intercept.
Very well, but if we
don't hear from you
in the next 12 hours
we take action ourselves
and hold you responsible
for the consequences.
We'll be in touch,
General.
Sorry to have woken you.
I was already awake.
How can I sleep?
Nothing but problems.
Problems, problems.
TECHNICIAN: Launch
pre-program complete, sir.
Launch globe number one.
T. D. R. S. S.
reports a launch, sir.
Continental U. S. A.
Vandenberg.
There are no
launches scheduled.
Check radar-jamming system.
Well?
Jamming power supply
and backup have failed, sir.
DRAX: Investigate immediately.
TECHNICIAN: Investigate
number 28, immediately.
James Bond.
You appear with
the tedious inevitability
of an unloved season.
I didn't think
there were any
seasons in space.
As far as you're concerned,
only winter.
And the treacherous
Dr. Goodhead.
Despite your efforts,
my finely wrought dream
approaches its fulfillment.
Your dream, whatever
sort of nightmare it is,
hasn't a chance, Drax.
You think not?
We shall see.
We're coming up to
second launch position.
Launch globe number two.
No doubt you have
realized the splendor
of my conception.
First, a necklace of
death about the Earth.
each releasing its nerve gas
over a designated area,
each capable of
killing 100 million people.
And the human race
as you know it
will cease to exist.
Then a rebirth,
a new world.
U. S. spacecraft on course
to intercept us, sir.
Activate laser.
Prepare to
destroy spacecraft.
You see, my dear Bond,
we're well able
to protect ourselves
against all enemies.
Allow me to introduce you
to the airlock chamber.
Observe, Mr. Bond, your route
from this world to the next.
And you, Dr. Goodhead.
Your desire to be
America's first
woman in space
will shortly be fulfilled.
Leaving you on
your flying stud farm,
conceiving your
new master race?
If you like, yes.
And of course,
anyone not measuring up
to your standards of
physical perfection
will be exterminated.
DRAX: Certainly.
Interesting.
Most interesting.
Jaws, expel them.
Jaws! You obey me!
Expel them!
Hold them!
Sir, U. S. spacecraft,
three minutes to intercept.
Stand by to laser it.
It's stopped rotating.
Open the cargo doors.
Number one platoon, EVA.
Let's try docking.
MAN: Colonel Scott will
take the first landing!
TECHNICIAN: Intruders
have docked at satellite
seven, sir.
DRAX: Double the guard
at every entrance
in this satellite.
Report intruders' progress
throughout the space station.
Number three globe
ready for launching, sir.
Proceed!
Colonel Scott,
don't shoot.
Hold your fire.
At least I shall
have the pleasure
of putting you
out of my misery.
Desolated, Mr. Bond?
Heartbroken, Mr. Drax.
Allow me.
Take a giant
step for mankind.
Where's Drax?
Oh, he had to fly.
How's Scott doing?
He's got control
of the Command satellite.
We put the launching gear
for the globes out of action.
When the station breaks up,
they'll disintegrate.
They'll harm no one.
But the three that have gone,
they'll kill millions.
Those three
must be destroyed.
Come on!
Colonel, get your men off
as quickly as possible.
Your mission is completed.
Sergeant, round up your men,
get them back to the shuttle.
Fast!
Back to the shuttle,
everybody!
On the double!
Moonraker Five,
that's the answer.
Drax's shuttle is
armed with a laser.
We can track those globes
and destroy them.
It's hopeless, sir.
The corridor's blocked.
They can't get to us now.
All right, let's go.
Docking release
system is jammed.
Release the door lock.
I'll see if I can
operate it manually.
It's jammed too.
Well, here's to us.
Jaws, we can't disengage.
The docking release
system is jammed.
Can you help us?
We're free.
Don't worry,
they'll make it.
It's only 100 miles to Earth.
Let's get a read-out
on those globes.
I have the three globes
on the screen.
We should have
a visual in a minute.
There it is.
The laser's on automatic.
Code 945 set.
One down, two to go.
Number two straight ahead.
What is it?
We're skipping on
the Earth's atmosphere.
In range.
We should see
the last one soon.
There it is.
It's getting hot.
It can't be helped.
I'm coming in
at a steeper angle
than I should
in order to catch
that last globe.
I can't hold this
course much longer.
We'll break up
at 200,000 feet.
Just a few seconds more.
Automatic firing
system negative.
Must be the heat.
Switching to manual.
Controls aren't responding.
The wings are
beginning to glow.
Just hold her steady.
Steady.
GOODHEAD: It's entering
Earth's atmosphere!
James, this is
our last chance.
Steady.
Colonel Scott
reports picking up
two survivors from
the space station,
a tall man and
a short blonde woman.
Right. Okay.
Dr. Goodhead reported
their position 20 minutes ago.
They're just coming into
range of our tracking ship
in the Pacific Ocean.
We should have audiovisual
within a few minutes
from the remote
onboard TV monitors.
As this is the first
joint venture between
our two countries,
I'm having it
patched directly
to the White House
and Buckingham Palace.
Well, I'm sure Her Majesty
will be fascinated.
MAN: We have audiovisual.
Ah, at last.
007.
My God, what's Bond doing?
I think he's attempting
re-entry, sir.
James?
I think it may be
time to go home.
Take me round the world
one more time.
Why not?
