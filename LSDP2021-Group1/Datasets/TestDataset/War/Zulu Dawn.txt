"Present military system to be abandoned.

Move yourselves!
Shall I give the order, sir? All right, Sergeant.
SIKALI HORSE, FORWARD!
Splendid horsemanship. Who are they?
Sikali Horse, my lord. Christians all. I know each man by name.
Do they come well recommended? They rode for me at Bushman's Pass.
Oh, indeed.
Crealock, see that Col Durnford has an officer for his hard riders - the subaltern from the 24th.
It might be more effective to find someone who speaks Zulu.
Yes. I see you issued each of them with a Martini-Henry carbine.
Our quota for natives - one rifle to ten men and five rounds per rifle. Will they make good use of them?
They're as good marksmen as horsemen.No doubting their horsemanship, Col Durnford.
Crealock.
We'll think how to make best use of Col Durnford's African knowledge.
Col Durnford. William Vereker.Yes? I hear you're seeking officers.
Good ones, yes, Mr Vereker. Gentlemen who can ride and shoot.
Private Williams!
You've stopped.
THEY SPEAK BANTU
Mr Raw!
Take Mr Vereker to the store and see he's issued the necessary equipment.
And then show him to the mess and explain to him how an officer's expected to behave.
Our good Col Durnford scored quite a coup with the Sikali Horse.
It's rumoured Lord Chelmsford's to make Durnford second-in-command. Typical of Her Majesty's Army!
Appoint an engineer to do a soldier's work.Now, now, Mr Melvill. Less of your spleen.
Stranger in the mess! Gentlemen, my lord.
Announce yourself.
Good day, Frederick.
Good day, William.
Pleased you could join us.It was that or join the Zulu.Join the Zulu?
Oh, yes, you're in the thick of it.
Your father said you were farming near Zululand.
Sent his regards, should I meet up with you.
That's nice of the old boy. You'd better call out who you are.

There's a shortage of that where I've been.
They fight with spears, don't they? Is that fair against a Martini-Henry?
Did you really choose between Britain and the Zulu?
A damn close thing it was, too. Ah, well done, Murphy.
Stranger's cup. Down it in one and we share your mess bill for a week.
And if I don't? You buy a bottle of good claret for each mess member.
If it's too much, we'll forward the bill to your father in the House of Lords. No offence meant, Vereker.
No offence taken, Melvill.
To men who aren't afraid to speak their minds.

Welcome! Welcome back!
Excuse me, ladies.
Did you get your farm going?
Yes, I did.
How was it?
I've never been so happy.
Sorry you had to leave.
You've met the Hon William Vereker, I believe.
Yes. We were childhood friends.
Your childhood friend shot a dead cow at the gallop yesterday.
Most impressive!
There is a Mrs Durnford, is there?
She exists but nothing's been heard of her the eight years Durnford's been in Africa.
Although much is spoken of her now, my lord.
I recommended him to you because he knows Africa so well.
Indeed. His ability to recruit native contingents is proving invaluable.
How do you rate him as a soldier?
It is widely held he has courage and he's an excellent engineer.
Shall we join the guests?
Do you think she might become interested in...someone?
Which one? The one who keeps looking at me.
Could be you flatter yourself - it's her odd eye.
They must've locked the good ones up!
Ah! General!
Do you find our border country congenial, my lord?
Landscape - congenial, ma'am. As a border - vulnerable.
Do you really think Cetshwayo will attack us?
The intention of the Zulu Impi and their king concern me deeply.
He has no intention of attacking Natal - unless he's given no option.
He has no quarrel with us.
How rare to meet a young lady interested in tactical matters!
Is it not most rare?
You are talking of a violent and murdering barbarian
with an army of 30,000 warriors just across the river.
My father has lived with the Zulus for many years.
Cetshwayo massacred 20,000 people to become king!
The English Tudor kings did no less -
much later in our nation's history, I might add.
And the French, much more recently.
That may well be, your grace, but be that as it may, my duty is clear...
..the defence of all this - Natal.
Yes.
Well, it's difficult to stand against that position -
IF you speak only of defence.
And what does our good Col Durnford think? >
If the people of Natal wish to feel safe,
let them persuade their husbands and sons to volunteer. We need officers and men.
We do, Colonel. Good point.
I cannot be brought to believe that Cetshwayo wants a war with Britain.
Every Zulu is raised to be a warrior.
Without war, there's no Zulu nation.
Nobody is really safe, are they?
Mrs DeWitt has four daughters, Henry, and I fear she feels for them all. >
Your daughters may indeed be in some danger, Mrs DeWitt - but not from the Zulus.
MUSIC DROWNS OUT SPEECH
Ladies and gentlemen, your attention, please!
I think I should inform you
that I am obliged to issue a notification
declaring a state of war between Her Majesty's Government
and the Zulu king, Cetshwayo,
on his non-compliance with the ultimatum made on him,
urging reparation and redress
for violations of British sovereignty.
SCATTERED APPLAUSE
Why?
Why do men think of nothing but killing?
This is a wonderful land
we're privileged to share.
Dear God...
..there should be room for all of us!
There goes No 2 Company.
Quartermaster. Quartermaster.
I'll see ya!
No-no!
Do I believe what me eyes see?
The whole bleedin' army moving off to meet the murdering heathen
and what goes on in here? A game of brag! BRAG!
Sorry, Quartermaster.
You'll be more sorry when the Zulu ask, "What can you offer me not to slit your gut?"
And you'll say, "The knave of hearts, sir! The knave of hearts!"
THEY CHUCKLE Move!
For the savage, as for the child,
chastisement is sometimes a kindness.
Let us hope, General,
that this will be the final solution to the Zulu problem.
Come on, boys! Get up!
Quick! Calm down!
And again! Come back here, you thief!
About ready, sir.
My lord, I've prepared a list of ideas for you to see.
Excellent! Give them to Crealock.
My lord, this list was prepared for you. I don't think another can understand its true value.
Thank you, Col Durnford.
Gentlemen, within ten days we shall cross the Buffalo River
and British soldiers will then be in Zululand.
Col Durnford will remain down-river
and defend the Natal border.
Will you hear Last Post, sir?
I listened to your Stand To this morning. It was perfect.
Couldn't have done it better myself - even when I was bugler to Wellington.
Where did you get that black eye? The cooks saw me dip your shaving tin
in their tea water. Made their tea taste of soap, they said.
So you got it in the line of duty.
Point taken.
Will we be fighting the Zulu soon?
Could be.
ATTAS!
When we cross the river into Zululand
they might be waiting there for us to show up -
them stabbing assegias pointing right at our bellies!
Are you afeard of the Zulu?
One Zulu is only one man, and I'm afeard of no one man!
But the Zulu, they come in thousands,
like a black wave of death, in their thousands.
Them assegias, stabbing!
Your orders, Mr Vereker?
I am to take the Sikali with the main column to the river.
Lord Chelmsford seems to want me to stay back with my Basutos.
Chelmsford wants a good man on the border -
he fears a flanking attack and wants you in reserve.
The wrong side of the river, the wrong place?!
Does he wish me to fight the Zulu or merely observe their habitat?
Sir.
God go with you, Mr Vereker.
SOLDIERS: Hip-hip! Hooray! Hip-hip! Hooray! Hip-hip! Hooray!
GET UP NOW! GET ON!
Get off his arse, you bloody idiot!
KEEP 'EM IN LINE!
Sarge! Sarge! I'm drowning, Sarge!
What the hell do you mean by having the same name as me?!
Sorry, Sarge!
Do you think Cetshwayo will send a party to greet you?
They're here. We just have to ensure they don't get back to announce us.
You mean you've seen them?
Forward, Sikali!
Come on! Come on!
What's that strange name the newspaper chap's called?
Nogg, sir. Actual name is Norris Newman. He's from The Standard.
Our runners bear his dispatches, do they not?Of course!
Come on, lads! It's only a river!
Come on! Make it today!
Come on, you lot! Get these bastards across!
It's only water! You'll only get wet! Come along, you idle scum!
Break that ammunition crate and I'll have your guts for garters!
An historic moment, don't you think?
Norris Newman of The Standard. I saw you lead our cavalry.
Indeed. I was one of the first across.Were they in good heart?
They spurred onto the high ground, full of spirit and looking for the Zulu.
Full of sport, they were, my lord.
Tell what you see, write it well, sir, and make sure you get it right.
If I've got it right, my lord,
you lead an invasion into Zululand -
I see it all around me -
but "Why?" is the question my readers will ask. "Why?"
Do not confuse yourself.
Why? We must strike a heavy blow. This cannot be a war of manoeuvre.
So attack is your defence.
Well, let's hope Cetshwayo will offer his Impis for destruction.
My only fear is that the Zulu will avoid engagement.
I have it, my lord, we attack for sport. Or is it reputations?
Enough of your politicking, Noggs.
I know your views on the press but people want to know what the regiments are doing.
Then I trust you will tell them exactly what you've observed.
Tricky business, Mr Bloomfield.
Look at that waste!
Five rounds ruined. Each round has to be accounted for.
It's terrible! Quite dreadful! Something must be done!
If they'd been put back in their boxes, the boxes screwed down -
as his lordship ordered -
nothing would've happened to them.
I refer to our drowned natives.
Natives is not on my invoices, Mr Harford.
Ammunition is, and has to accounted for, AND brass cartridge cases returned.
Several natives went under. Shouldn't we have a roll call?
Not practical - we haven't had time to make up the roll yet.
Besides, I'm not sure how many we had before the crossing.

Major, send the troops.Yes, sir.
Well done, sir! Did you see that, Noggs? >
He deceived him with the up and took him with the down.
Well, well! This one's a grandfather at least!
If he'd been a Zulu in his prime, I'd have given odds against your lancer, Melvill.
Well, gentlemen, first blood to us!
And a rousing good report in the newspapers
to satisfy the politicians!

I'm ill. Dozens of them followed me.
I must've shot five, six, ten - I lost count.
They just kept coming! Blood-curdling swine!
Why did they attack you? I discovered their army. ..A valley full of them.
- What army? - Beyond them hills and coming this way.
Mr Vereker, would you mind taking a look at this map?
By all means, Colonel.
Your wagons, Colonel. What about my wagons?
On this open slope you must bring them round and form them into a laager - immediately.
I hear you have prisoners, Colonel. Well done! Evening, William!
Thank you, sir!
I think you should hear this. Your brother didn't laager his camp... >
They had 73 in their party - they found 73 skeletons six months later.
Boers require a laager with only a few wagons - we have many.
An unassailable square of British fire power
is a defence which can be formed in a moment. You're leaving us?
I'm going to camp among the rocks over there.
My lord, Mr Fannin claims to have seen the Zulu Impi -
some few thousand or so - exactly here in this valley.
Unlikely - it would mean taking 24,000 men over mountain tops.
This is not helpful!
Have the prisoners brought to my camp.
SOLDIERS LAUGH All right, Corporal. Anything?
No, sir. Nothing.
Be sensible, man! Tell us!
Good evening! Dirty work, eh?
Very dirty.
PRISONER SPEAKS IN ZULU
What did they say?Claim they're deserters from the Impis in the east.
Followed this one so they could give themselves up, go home.
Do you believe that?
They're well oiled, fed regularly - it's unlikely they're fugitives.
Have them questioned further.
They claim the Impis are east towards the Royal Kraal
and yet this fellow says they're further towards the north.
Wherever they are, there are 60,000 or more.
They multiply, Mr Fannin. You speak the Zulu tongue?
Tomorrow I intend to find the Zulu Impi and you will accompany me.
I'm no soldier, your honour, and it's further into Zululand.
You will accompany me or you will me arrested.
This way, Mr Fannin.
Crealock, we have scouts where he claims he saw the Zulus?
Of course, sir.And?
The only reports of enemy activity
have come from the direction of the Royal Kraal, at Ulundi.
Thank you.
Why don't the Zulus attack?
Zulu may not wear shoes or trousers and the like
but that doesn't mean to say they've got no brains.
They'll watch us and wait - find our weaknesses.
Have we weaknesses, Quartermaster?

Rumours to draw you off to leave Natal open to a counter-thrust?!
Cetshwayo wants a head-on battle, a decisive victory,
so his people can get on with what truly matters - the delayed harvest.
Are you dictating the strategy of this war?!
I'm explaining my reasons.
Yes?A large party of Zulus has been sighted towards the King's Kraal.
Tomorrow we will continue our advance on Ulundi.

Crealock, old fella,
I'm doing notes for my dispatch
and I need to clear up a few military points.
I don't want to bother his lordship.
I had it drummed into me that a good commander never willingly splits his force -
especially in an enemy's country - before knowing their dispositions.
If we were facing a European enemy with guns, your point would hold.
May I remind you, I do not create the strategies you comment on.
I'm only his lordship's secretary.
I wouldn't take overly comfort from that, Crealock, old fella,
because if he sinks, then you sink with him.
So, you've been asked to look after me, Lieutenant.
I assure you, sir, I have no desire to create difficulties.
And I say you do not. I'd be obliged for your advice.
What have your scouts seen? So far, only THEIR scouts.
But we've had reports of a small Impi further north, over there.
His lordship believes it's far too difficult an approach to be chosen by the Zulu command.
Yes, well, difficulty never deterred a Zulu commander. How many?
We don't know.
I think it would be wise to picket the hills.
