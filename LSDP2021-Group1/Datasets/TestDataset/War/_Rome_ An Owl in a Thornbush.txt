An Owl in a Thornbush
What's wrong, mother ?
Ruined.
Ruined !
That idiot has ruined us all !
We shall have to leave Rome !
Caesar has crossed the Rubicon.
He's on Italian soil under arms.
It's an act of gross treason.
With a single legion, if you please.
So not merely treason,
but suicidal treason.
Will that be all, domina* ?
*domina = mistress
Have you heard ?
Strange.
A foolish thing to do.
One legion.
I wonder what he's thinking.
I remember back when I destroyed the Illyrian pirates*,
*Illyria is Western Crotia and Slovenia.
Pompey became famous and got the nickname of Magnus
thanks to his exploits against pirates in Mediterranean Sea in 67 b. C.
There was one particular old sea snake...
A Liburnian*, if I recall....
*Nowadays Liburnia is the Hrvatsko Primorje, the Croatian coastal.
Never mind the Illyrian pirates.
What is to be done ?
I have already given word.
My legions are gathering.
And you'll crush him, yeah ?
Without question.
The poor man is dead.
You are to take our Ubian cavalry
and scout all roads and defensive strong points
between here and the City*.
* With a cap letter, the City is Rome.
Advance until resistance is met.
If and when civilians are encountered,
deliver the enclosed proclamation.
If you encounter no resistance,
go directly to the forum
and nail it to the Senate door.
Sir.
There will be no rapine, pillage or burning.
Any questions ?
None, sir.
That will be all.
What makes your man Vorenus so morose ?
He is stonewall catonian.
He thinks we've committed a terrible crime,
a mighty sacrilege,
and shall be severely punished by the gods.
- He may be right.
- It's a crime if we lose.
If we win, it isn't.
I am merely pursuing my legimate rights, Antony.
- Of course.
- Do you think we can trust him ?
- Who ?
- Lucius Vorenus.
Deep 13th, him.
He'd follow the eagle up Pluto*'s ass.
*Pluto is the God of the Underworld and rules on the dead people.
I told you not to come here.
I had to see my son.
You've seen him.
Now go.
And stay away.
Help me, Niobe.
I'm going insane.
You can't forsake me.
I do.
I won't give up.
Don't think I will.
You loved me once,
you will love me again.
I never loved you.
Lie to yourself if you want,
but don't lie to me.
Stay away.
You know you will never see your husband now,
you know that, eh ?
Him and all the rest of them are doomed.
You don't know that.
Everybody knows that.
That may be, but I made a vow.
Go.
Go.
I swear to Dis*, if you don't go...
*Dis = other name of Pluto, god of the underworld.
Means in Latin "Rich" and so Pluto is
cause he's the king of the numerous country of the Deads and because the earth is full of precious ores.
It's all right.
He's going.
Just go.
You promised you would never see him again.
I didn't want him here.
I told him to go.
It didn't look like that.
You could tell papa the truth.
It's not your fault.
If you and I spoke to him...
Never.
You have sworn.
You thought he was dead.
Papa will understand.
He will kill us all.
You...
You often say that you are adept with the women.
No idle boast neither.
There are girls from Narbo to Thebes
that scream my name by night.
I have no need of your coital expertise.
My question more concerns their... affections.
I'm your man for that to boot.
My wife, she...
You heard what she said, she hates me.
What's your question ?
How do I stop her from hating me, obviously ?
It's not obvious.
I thought you were making her hate you with a purpose.
That was not my intent at all.
Why would I do that ?
I don't know.
You're the clever one, you.
There might have been 1000 reasons.
I love her.
I require that she love me also,
else I am merely her slave.
I cannot tolerate that.
Well, what care you what she feels for you
if we're all going to die this week or next ?
And so we are, but who will honor my name
when I am gone ?
Who will pay Proserpina* and Pluto for my keep ?
*Proserpina is Pluto's wife, who rules the underworld.
Who will pour wine* upon my grave ?
*The wine is poured upon a grave for the libations for the deads.
If it comes to that, I shall do the honors.
It's the least I could do.
Thank you.
But it's not the same thing.
Besides...
You'll be dead too.
I'm planning on having a small party this evening
and I'll need you to...
Are you wearing perfume ?
Just a dab.
It's horrid.
Horseshit suits you much better.
Now I need you to get more men to stand guard outside
to greet my guests when they arrive.
A party ?
Is that wise, given how things are ?
Perfume, advice...
Whatever next ?
I'm just saying Pompey's mob is out for blood.
- It's best to lay low.
- Lay low ?
I'm not a lizard.
I will not be intimidated.
As you like.
Cost you extra though.
You've been paid quite adequately already.
More men cost more.
I will tell Castor to speak with you.
I don't want more money.
Well, what do you want then ?
You know what I want.
Something like that.
- You forget your place.
- My place is with my family.
Say the word, and I'll go to them.
Do your job to my satisfaction and...
I'll see that you're properly rewarded.
Thank you, domina.
Pompey's outriders.
His legions won't be far behind.
Us and the rest of the 13th will be on crosses by market day.
Thank the gods my father didn't live to see his son die a traitor.
Best to die now then, eh ? Go on.
Wait ! We're not here to fit.
"Advance until resistance is met."
That is our orders.
That is what we do.
Why not ? The boys are ready,
aren't you, boys ?
Let's have a go.
Come on !
No fight !
No ! No fight now !
Damned idiot !
Form up and defend !
Remember your training !
Shields !
- Hold your ground !
- Stand tall !
Stand tall !
Get back, coward !
Stay in place, you cowards !
Get back here
Caesar's scouts are only 30 miles* from Rome.
*1 Roman mile = 1481,50 meters
His speed is uncanny.
Of course, he has only a very few men,
Which makes a fast pace easier.
He is not leading an army so much as an armed gang.
It is all highly irregular, unethical even.
Gods, it is not even the war season*.
*War season is from March to September.
Surely he does not think to attack Rome directly ?
I think that is exactly what he will do.
How can he hope to succeed ?
The problem is, at this moment,
We have only three legions in arms
for the defense of the city.
Surely, three is more than enough.
Normally that would be true,
but most of the men
are raw recruits like those
who fled from the scouts.
The rest are veterans of Gaul.
Caesar's men...
Not reliable.
Rome is undefended !
My legions are mustering as swiftly as possible,
but it will take at least four days
to assemble a force capable of defending the city.
Caesar is two days away.
You touch it with a needle.
What do we do now then ?
We must make a tactical retreat to the South.
A  tactical  retreat, mind you.
Leace the city ?
Juno's cunt !
Do you run mad ?
You cannot speak to me in that tone.
My friends, let us cleave to the matter at hand.
Is there no alternative to retreathen ?
None. We shall withdraw to Corfinium*
*Corfinium, also called Italica  is a town in the Samnium, in Italy,
between Latium, Campania and Apulia.
and rally my legions there.
Once they are gathered and in good order,
we will simply retake the city.
Caesar has no hope of reinforcement until spring.
The towns of Italy will close their gates to him.
We will have an unassailable advantage
in men and resources.
So in fact, this is not a humiliating defeat at all
but a rare species of victory ?
Calm yourself, Cato.
You lack understanding of things military,
else you would see that my actions
have been perfectly correct at all times.
You have lost Rome without unsheathing your sword.
You lost Rome !
Did you see ?*
*This central opening in the roof of the atrium is called "compluvium" and lets in the light and the water of rain
Pompeian scum at our very door !
It's intolerable.
If Timon and his men weren't here,
they'd be burning down the house.
They are not that energetic.
This suicidal rebellion has turned everyone against us.
I swear, if Caesar were here now,
I would stab him in the neck.
- He has ruined us.
- I'm not so sure of that.
But I think Pompey's position is deceptively weak.
Think, think, think...
That's all you do, you silly boy.
All our friends have abandoned us,
Cowards that they are.
We Julii are lepers now.
Let us not exaggerate.
Not all of your friends have deserted you.
And that will be remembered.
You are good loyal people.
It's very tempting to abandon Caesar,
but to do so now,
well, that would look like we're mere...
...slaves to fashion.
You're staying to protect the house
but don't think for a moment that your master
and I will not return.
We will be back by the calends* at the latest.
*Calends are on the first day of each month.
When I do return,
those of you I find
have not done their utmost duty will pay with their lives.
General, your escort is ready.
Gnaeus.
Durio, is the escort ready ?
- Ready, sir.
- Away then.
Husband, the treasury ?
Yes, of course.
Durio.
You must secure
as much of the treasury gold as possible.
Take a detachment and open up the Capitoline vaults.
There's not much time,
so do what you can.
Let's pretend we're Odysseus and his friends,
creeping out of the cyclops' cave.
We must be quiet as little mice, all right ?
Come.
- Sorry about all this.
- Do not say so.
I don't mind a little excitement.
All will be well, I assure you.
I have no doubt.
Let's away.
And remember, no sound.
Break it down !
Here's a mercy.
Instead of living out our lives in shame and disgrace,
w
e are to be raped and beaten
and torn limb from limb by a raving mob.
These brutes will not let you pass, I think.
You may stay the night if you want.
We would be delighted, thank you.
Wait wait.
Wrong way.
The Appian gate is to the right.
We're not going to the appian.
What ?
Of course, your best method for pleasing a woman
is the warm, beating heart of an enemy.
Women will say they don't like it, but they do.
It makes them wet as October.
That doesn't answer.
Well, failing that, talk to her.
Talk ?
- But of what ?
- That doesn't matter.
It's all about the tone of the voice.
You pretend like you're putting a saddle on a skittish horse.
"There, honey.
Shh, come now."
You know, that sort of thing.
- That's all ?
- What else ?
Oh ! Tell her she is beautiful all the time.
Tell her she's beautiful every time you see her,
even when she's not.
And what else ?
Oh ! Also, very important...
When you couple with her, there's a spot just above her cunny...
It's like little button.
Now, attend to that button,
and she will open up like a flower.
How do you know this of her ?
All women have them.
Ask anyone.
Ho ho ho, very pretty.
Come up behind !
- Come with us !
- Sit up here !
You can make me happy !
It'll make me happy.
Here you go. Up you go.
Come on !
I will kill Octavia,
and Merula tends to me,
but if she cannot, and I am taken alive,
then you must kill me.
And then you must kill yourself.
Your survival would be inappropriate.
I would not think of living, domina.
Octavian, who would you prefer kills you ?
I am old enough to take care of myself.
Oh, that's my brave little man.
Servilia...
Can my people be of any assistance to you ?
Thank you but I'm sure we can manage by ourselves somehow.
Very well.
Mother, I would rather it were not you killed me
if you have no objection.
Why ever not ?
You can't still be angry with me.
- Is that an order ?
- Bona dea* !
*Bona dea means "the good goddess".
Faunus' daughter, sometimes called Fauna, she was a goddess of fertility, healing, virginity and women.
I feel like you have never listened...
Cerberus* is howling for us, and still you plague me
* Three-headed dog with back spiked with heads of snakes. He's the warden of the gates of the Underworld.
with your ridiculous feelings ?
If you had only let Glabius and I remarry...
Oh, always Glabius !
I spit on Glabius !
I piss on the wretch !
Oh, that's right, mother, die as you have lived...
- Poison brimming in your soul !
- Listen !
I'll not argue with you.
Castor, be sure to cut Octavia's throat
before you cut mine.
Please, Castor, let mother do it.
I won't deny her one last pleasure.
It would be undaughterly.
Listen !
Consul Gnaeus Pompey Magnus has left the city.
He commands all noblemen and knights* to do likewise.
*The knights or "equestrians" are one of the two upper social classes in Rome.
Those that remain will be considered
-  enemies of Rome.
- Cowards !
You heard, then.
Don't know what good that will do.
Anyone wants to get in, they'll get in.
Give us a hand, will you ?
So your man will be back after all, looks like.
It looks like.
You don't sound too happy about it.
Of course I'm happy.
He's my husband.
If you say so.
I'm sorry.
I was just talking.
I talk too much.
I don't know, Rissa.
I try my best to love him, I do.
I don't know whether I want him to come back.
I would not credit it if I had not seen it myself.
Pompey's men deserting the city,
deserting Rome,
Half the Senate ahorse.
A comical sight no doubt.
Gods.
We...
...are in a damned awkward position.
If we stay...
we are declaring for Caesar,
for rebellion.
And if we go, we...
We are with Pompey and the Senate.
There is no middle ground.
So what is the answer ?
Caesar is our dearest friend, but what he is doing is...
I do not know.
You must decide.
Pompey then.
We must go with Pompey.
The republic is more important than any friendship.
- Do you agree ?
- It's your decision.
Pompey then.
Pompey then.
We have no time to lose.
Tell your women to be ready to leave as soon as possible.
I'm not leaving.
What do you mean ?
I've waited eight years for Caesar.
I cannot leave now.
You cannot stay, not if I go.
Course I can stay.
I can do as I wish.
Mother, all who stay are enemies of Rome.
- Pompey has declared it.
- Caesar might prevail.
Yes, he might rule Rome for a week, a month, a year even,
but then some other ambitious man
will kill him and take his place,
And you then will be the mistress of a dead tyrant.
Mother, we know what happens to them.
That is for the gods decide.
I cannot help loving him.
A va, mother !
You...You are blinded by untapped lust.
I'll get you a good big Cyrenian* at the market
and have done with it !
*Cyrenaica is an African province,
limited to the West by Egypt and to the South by Lybia.
You'd better go.
Don't be angry with me.
We may be parted for a long time.
Come.
Goodbye, mother.
Goodbye, my love.
Your daughter left.
When ?
Just now.
I put a boy to following her.
I'll put a stop to this nonsense.
Fetch your men.
What ?
Now.
Why have you not left the city ?
I could not leave without seeing you.
It's not safe for you.
Everyone knows you're with Pompey.
Don't fret.
I'll be gone by sunrise.
- That's all I have.
- Thank you.
But this is not a robbery.
- Atia.
- I'll give you a moment,
if there are gods you'd like to speak to.
One favor...
Let my men live.
Sorry.
It's orders.
Give me your sword.
What are they, the stars ?
Stars ?
Holes in the celestial spheres.
Holes through which the light of the heavens shine.
How big are these holes ?
They're big.
They only seem small to us because they're hundreds of miles away.
Big enough for a man to climb through ?
I suppose.
But man would never be able to
get up there in the first place.
I don't see why not.
How ?
He could hold onto a giant bird.
It doesn't work like that.
- Why not ?
- It's philosophy.
It's hard to explain.
Really, Numa, that's quite unnecessary.
I beg you stand.
There shall be no formality here,
not between old friends like us.
A thousand gratitudes, Atia.
We humbly seek the protection
and friendship of your family.
Sadly, there are some people who say
That I am of the pompeian faction.
Are you not ?
All of Pompey's faction have long since fled.
You stay for fear your factories and storehouses will be looted.
I assure you, that's not true...
Castor.
- 5000 denarii.
- That much ?
- I... I...
- Please, let us not be vulgar.
I'll make the arrangements immediately.
Where is your man Durio ?
He is long overdue now.
Durio is the best man I have.
He won't fail.
But if not, what then ?
How do we pay the legions ?
How do we feed them ?
I have not the least idea.
You fret like a woman, Cato.
Durio will return with more than enough gold to feed and pay the legions.
By any road we'll be back in Rome before spring,
so stop worrying.
It makes no sense.
We should have been stopped by now.
Why is Rome not defended ?
Our boys scared 'em off, eh ?
Soldiers of the republic do not run,
so it must be a stratagem or trick.
Then it's a good trick.
Unless the gods have abandoned Rome.
If Mars* was watching,
*Mars is the god of the war.
he would not allow such a disgrace.
Well, maybe he was having a crap and missed it.
It's that sort of disrespect that has led us to this sad pass.
If the gods are not respected,
hen why should they help us ?
Still no troops.
They will have flanked us, I expect.
Perhaps these drovers know something.
- Salve*, citizens.
- Captain.
*Salve = expression of greeting
- You come from the City ?
- We do.
How goes it there ?
You're Caesar's men.
We are.
Fortune spreads her legs for you.
Pompey has fled.
The city is yours.
Why would Pompey flee ?
You boys were too fast for him.
He couldn't raise his armies quick enough.
Him and his men are retreating South,
and the Senate with 'em.
See ?
Wrong for once.
Well, uh, enjoy your victory boys.
- How much do you want for the girl ?
- Not for sale.
What's in the wagon ?
- Grain.
- Show us, soldier.
There's no soldiers here.
My mistake.
You all wear the soldier's boot,
So I assumed you are soldiers, but I'm wrong.
But why would nine good soldiers
be guarding a grain wagon ?
I don't have to show you nothing.
My fidelity, always, domina.
I do not like to doubt you, Proculus, but
it's an age since I have seen you at my morning levy*.
*Here is a scene between a patron
and the clients .
Each morning, the client had to come and greet the patron ,
and could get some food.
Perhaps you have been unwell.
Goiters is it ?
Ah, uh...
Goiters, as you say.
Fat, greedy men often find it so.
I shall kill an owl that your good health continue.
Speak sense, you creature.
What vile trade is this ?
Bringing corpses to honest* doors ?!
*Atia's indignation isn't any fake: death is considered as a stain.
Take it away !
See what you have done !
The city's unguarded.
It's true then.
The republic is fallen.
Yet the sky is still above us, and the earth still below.
- Strange.
- The gods are in no hurry.
They will take their time in tormenting us.
Let's go back and see what's in that wagon.
Untie that girl.
Not our concern.
We follow orders.
Advance until resistance is met.
- But that poor girl...
- You will do your duty.
You are a mean bastard,
that's your problem.
You've no love in you.
You can talk sweet as you like to Niobe,
it won't do you any good.
She won't believe a word.
Hercule, you wake at last.
I was worried.
Water ?
My poor baby.
It was not a dream then.
Glabius is dead.
He is.
I'm sorry.
Why do you look at me like that ?
Like what ?
As if  I...
Did you ?
- How can you ask me that question ?
- Did you ?
- How can you ask me that question ?
- Did you ?
I did not !
And I'm tortured that you would harbor such a...
...horrible notion.
Look at me !
Daughter...
I swear on the masks* of all my ancestors
*Atia talks about death masks made for the cult of the ancestors.
that I had nothing...
nothing to do with the killing of Glabius.
Who do you think did it, mamma ?
The streets are full of corpses.
It could have been anyone.
"These are the words of Gaius Julius Caesar,
direct descendant of Venus*,
*The Julii pretend to be the descendant of the godess Venus
by her son's, the Troyan prince Enea's, son, Iulius .

*During the republic a proconsul is a consul who rules a province at end of his office, or some deputy in this office.
glorious imperator* of the Northern legions.
*"imperator" doesn't mean "empereor" but "general".
Citizens, I have returned to Italy
with the sole intention of claiming
my legal and moral rights.
I have no desire for unlawful powers.
I will name no man an enemy
who does not so declare himself.
Even so, the property of those enemies
will not be appropriated
and their person will remain inviolate
as long as their opposition be peaceful.
Moreover, to any man that has taken arms against me
and now regrets it,
I gladly offer total amnesty.
However, those that continue to use violence
to oppose my legal rights,
they shall receive that which they seek to give.
Under the auspices of Jupiter Capitolinus*,
*Jupiter Capitolinus belongs with Juno and Minerva to the Capitolin triad protecting Rome and which is the most honored.
These are the words of Gaius Julius Caesar."
What are you doing ?
I have done my duty and I have sinned enough.
I resign.
That's desertion !
I am a traitor and a rebel.
Why not a deserter as well ?
You can't just leave the 13th.
Goodbye, Pullo.
To Venus The Birth-Giver*,
I make this sacrifice.

of the 13th legion.
I have a wife.
Her name is Niobe.
Venus, let her love me as I love her.
I give my blood to make it so.
Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.
You're very beautiful.
I've come to see that...
...it may be, through ignorance,
that I have not treated you as I should.
- As I should treat you.
- Please, don't.
When we married you had only 13 summers,
and soon enough I was gone.
But now you are a woman,
and I know nothing of women.
Soldiering is all I know.
Which is not useful.
I have been sullen
and untrusting and cold.
But I am not made of stone.
I can change.
I will swear on the life of my daughter's son.
I will change, if you would have it so.
Please, speak if you would not have it so,
And I will leave without rancor.
- It is I have done wrong.
- How so ?
I am...
I have not been...
The past is gone.
Can we start again ?
I applaud you.
You're about to enter Rome as a bloodstained conqueror,
and yet you look as calm as a cup of water.
I am glad I appear so.
Gracchus !
Something more cheerful.
