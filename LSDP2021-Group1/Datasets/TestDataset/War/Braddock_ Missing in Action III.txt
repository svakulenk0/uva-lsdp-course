MAN: Let's go!
Everybody in!
All right, you guys okay?
All right, go! Go!
WOMAN: He's going out
and burning all the evidence!
- MAN: Urgent! Urgent!
- MAN 2: I want to go!
Where's Lin? Lin Braddock.
She left.
- Do you know where she went?
- I don't know.
Lin, is your man
really taking you to America?
Yes, of course.
What about all this?
I can't take everything.
Ahh! Ahh!
What about this?
Please, take it. Take anything you want.
MAN: Stay back! Stay back!
I can't lift you!
Visas first!
I can't help you all! We have no room!
Captain, has a Lin Braddock
come to the gate?
MAN: If you work for the embassy,
have your papers ready!
If you work for the embassy,
have your papers ready!
Not yet, Colonel.
- You're a friend of Lin?
- I'm her husband.
She went to her home!
When?
One hour, maybe two.
She had to get her papers.
The dress is so beautiful! Thank you!
Good-bye, Mimi. Take care.
Bye.
Yeah!
- Hold it.
- We found her upstairs.
Do you know her?
My God.
BRADDOCK: Guess what I've got.
- MAN: All right, hit it!
- MAN 2: Roger!
MAN: I said, get the hell off of here!
MAN 2: I can't find her!
I'm Lin Braddock! Look at the list!
I work for the embassy!
Lin Braddock!
- Captain!
- What is it?
She says she's on the list.
- What name?
- Lin Braddock!
I'm a translator for the embassy!
- Give me your papers!
- I lost them! They stole them!
- Please! Look at the list!
- Oh, come on.
I need your papers!
I told you, somebody stole them!
You have to believe me, please!
Well, there's nothing I can do about that!
- Please, look at the list!
- Wait a minute.
Colonel Braddock... This morning,
you were supposed to be here?
Yes!
MAN: Get them down!
Stand aside! Move!
MAN: Come on, Junior, get these down!
Hold him back!
Get off me! Get out of the way!
Move!
Let's go!
Please! Wait, stop! Please!
Wait, please! Please!
Please!
MAN: Keep your heads down. Don't crowd.
Commander, please!
I give you a thousand dollars!
Please! I love America! Come on!
Hey! Let me go up!
Hey!
Let me go! Hey!
BRADDOCK: Hey, take off!
Don't worry, we got you, Colonel!
Make space! Nice and easy.
- There you go, Colonel, it's okay.
- WOMAN: Get him in.
MAN: All right, move 'em out! Move!
- Hi, Cindy.
- Hey.
I should run for president.
- What did you say?
- I didn't think...
Oh, really?
- Mr. Braddock?
- That's right.
Colonel James Braddock?
- What can I do for you?
- Could I have a few moments of your time?
- Sit down.
- Thank you.
Please, could we please talk
more privately?
Yeah, sure.
Thank you.
Here you go.
Would you like something to drink?
No, no, thank you.
I'm Reverend Polanski from the Amerasian
Children's Mission in Vietnam.
Officially, I come to this country
to raise funds for the mission.
I was hoping I could find you
before I went back.
Find me. Why?
About a year ago, a young Amerasian child
came to the mission, begging for help.
He told me that his mother was sick.
I went to see if there was
anything I could do
and found out she worked
for the U.S. Embassy during the war.
She has been severely punished
by the Vietnamese Government.
Having a half-American son,
it made things even worse for her.
Well, I'm sorry to hear that,
but what's that got to do with me?
The woman's married name is
"Mrs. James Braddock."
What did you say?
I'm talking about your wife, Mr. Braddock.
- Lin Tan Cang.
- You're mistaken.
No, there is no mistake.
My wife died during the fall of Saigon.
Your wife is alive. I know her quite well.
Your son's name is Van.
He's now 12 years old.
My wife and I didn't have a son.
Why is it so hard for you to believe me?
Because I saw my wife's body
burnt to a crisp, that's why!
You may have seen a body,
but it wasn't your wife!
Lin Tan Cang is alive!
Believe whatever you want, Reverend.
I know better.
Your few moments are up.
Even if you did believe me, I doubt
if there's anything you could do.
I've already gone to the State Department,
and they will do nothing.
But I had to let you know.
Good-bye, Mr. Braddock. God be with you.
Braddock?
C.I.A.
Please come with us.
Wait outside.
It's been a long time, Colonel Braddock.
How've you been?
You know how I've been, Littlejohn.
Now, what do you want?
You just met with a Reverend Polanksi.
So?
Did he tell you some kind of crazy story
about your wife being alive?
Is that a crazy story?
Of course it is!
Big mistake, Littlejohn.
I didn't believe it until now.
What are you going to do
about getting them out?
Nothing.
If I don't get them out,
they're going to die.
People die every day.
Braddock! I'm warning you.
Don't step on any toes.
I don't step on toes, Littlejohn.
I step on necks.
WOMAN ON P.A.: Welcome to Bangkok.
We hope you enjoyed your flight
and will fly with Thai Airlines again.
Take me downtown.
Now, look here, mate,
I said I need more room.
Now, beat it!
Oh, well, you're strong!
Woo, you can take me home!
You want to try knocking me off?
How the hell are you, Braddock?
Did you get everything?
Oh, geez.
Yes, I got everything!
But it sure as hell wasn't easy.
That's why I appreciate it, Mik.
That's what friends are for, Braddock.
Which reminds me, got my money?
- Let's go.
- No, no, no!
No need to hurry! The plane
won't be loaded for several hours yet.
We got a long drive out of town.
Oh, shit, here comes trouble.
- Go get the car and pull out front.
- Agh, okay.
Hey!
You're not going anywhere, Mikelchyk.
Take him to the car.
Geez! Hey, loosen up a little bit!
Watch my beer, man!
I warned you, Braddock,
not to fuck with us.
Don't try to stop me, Littlejohn.
You're stopped. Come on.
Freeze, asshole, or you're dead!
Excuse me, girls!
Braddock!
Cut him off! Cut him off! Braddock!
Braddock!
Stop right there.
Braddock, freeze!
You actually made it!
- Uh-oh.
- Shit!
Get in your cars and go after him! Hit it!
MIK: Oh, no!
Way to go, man!
Jesus, Braddock! Couldn't you have
lined up just a... just a teeny bit?
I mean, I got to live here!
You've got a one-way ticket out!
Oh! Ah!
Jesus, Braddock!
Hey, watch it!
Whoa!
Oh! Oh, oh, oh, oh!
Hey!
Oh, shit, Braddock!
We'll have the whole damn
police force after us!
How far is it to the plane?
It's quite a ways out of Bangkok.
No, it'll be daylight before we get there.
Get us going, man!
Let's go, let's go!
Are you sure this thing
will get off the ground?
Oh, relax!
Sit back, enjoy the ride!
It's like Coney Island.
Ah...
Okay, Braddock.
Are you gonna tell me where we're
going now, as if I didn't know?
Along the coast. Qan Rai Bay.
We're going to have to skim the waves
when we get there,
to stay underneath their radar.
Hey, Braddock, you've clone some flying.
Why don't you take the controls, eh?
Give me a rest.
Let's see if you can fly
as well as you can drive, eh?
- It's been a long time.
- You can do it.
I tell you, it's a lot calmer up here
than it is in your automobile.
You know, when we get to the drop zone,
I'm gonna pull her up into a climb,
and you'll have about five seconds to make
the drop before I put her into a dive.
I'll need ten seconds.
Well, if you're a good boy,
I'll give you ten seconds.
MIK: Vietnam. I never thought
I'd be coming back.
I guess we never really can leave, can we?
Oh, come on, get your ass
back there. I'll take it.
Okay, Braddock, you've got 30 seconds!
Good luck, mother.
See you in hell, you crazy bastard.
Come on!
Let us each give thanks in our own way.
ALL: Amen.
Thank you Father, wise and good,
for home, and friends, and daily food.
Bless, dear Lord, the food we take,
and keep us all...
Oh, my God!
And keep us all home and safe.
Amen.
ALL: Amen.
Please start without me.
I'll be right back.
Braddock!
How on earth did you get here?
- Where's my wife?
- She doesn't live very far.
Can you tell me how to get there?
I'll take you there.
Here. Wear this.
There is a curfew.
We must be very careful.
I tried to tell you how bad it was.
You'd better go, Reverend.
And thanks.
Good luck.
And God bless you.
I didn't know. I thought you were...
It's not important.
I prayed you would come for us.
And you are here.
That is all that matters to Van and I.
This is your son, Jim.
Hello, Van.
Van...
I speak English, Braddock!
For years, he dreamed about you.
Sometimes, in very difficult moments,
I would find him talking to you
as if you were there.
And somehow you
would make things right for him.
But one day, he stopped believing.
I tried to keep you alive in his heart.
I tried.
I guess I know how you feel, Van.
Thinking that I deserted you
and your mother.
But... I want you to know that...
Van, please!
If I'd known that you
and your mother were alive,
there's nothing in the world
that would have stopped me
from coming for you before now.
You've suffered so much.
I know I have changed, Jim.
I'm sorry I am no longer pretty for you.
You'll always be beautiful to me.
We have to go now.
We are ready.
Let me check the street first.
Van, hurry!
Come on!
Hurry, hurry!
JIM: The boat's right down there.
It might be a tight squeeze, but I think
you're going to enjoy the ride, Van.
If you say so, Braddock!
Please be patient.
We've only had each other for 12 years.
And now...
It is very difficult for him.
He will need some time.
We have all the time in the world.
I love you very much, James Braddock.
I think I should talk to our son
for a moment.
I'll go get the boat ready.
Van.
Van, all right.
Everything will be all right.
You don't care about me now.
You only care about him!
That is not true.
It is our love that brought you
into this world.
Your father loves you as I do.
If you will only give him a chance.
Please try, Van.
Mama... I'm very scared.
I know you are.
But once we get to America,
everything will be better,
I promise.
Your father promises.
Lin, we have to get out of here! Hurry!
Foolish.
Very foolish to come back.
I am General Quoc.
How do you do, Madame Braddock?
And this must be your son, Van.
Very good-looking boy.
When I received the report
that a strange-looking boat
had outrun my gunboats
and heading towards Ho Chi Minh City,
I took the privilege of assuming
it was you, Colonel Braddock,
since Reverend Polanski had just
returned from your country.
But now, Braddock...
...you must pay for the crimes
that you have committed
against my beloved country.
They have nothing to do with this.
You are absolutely right.
No!
Mom!
You will find your first test
quite challenging.
MAN: Out!
Usually we use people
who are a little bit taller.
I have tested many before, Braddock,
and no one has lasted even an hour.
Maybe you can be the first, eh?
I'll do whatever you want.
Just let the boy go.
You will do what I want anyways.
Well done.
Well done, Colonel Braddock.
You are every bit as tough
as your reputation.
I like that.
I like that!
You have not disappointed me, Braddock.
No!
This has gone on long enough!
Braddock!
- Van!
- I'm in here!
Let's go, come on!
- Can you make it?
- Yeah.
Go to the mission.
Braddock!
What's wrong? What are you doing?
Where is Braddock?
Where is Braddock?!
I don't know where Braddock is, General.
You lie, Priest! You lie!
We know you help Braddock!
I? You must be mistaken.
You lie!
Perhaps a change of environment
will help you to think more clearly?
Monkey eyes. Take him!
Please, no! I can't leave my children!
They need me!
Of course!
I wouldn't want to separate you
from your half-breed
American bastard children!
Take them all! Take them all!
Priest, your new home
will be Go Dau Ha prison!
Mm?
Ow!
Ay! Ay!
No! No!
No!
No! No!
No! No!
No...
No! No!
Stop! Stop!
Stop!
Kids, in the truck!
Van, where's the Reverend?
I know! I'll get him, Braddock!
Braddock! Braddock!
BRADDOCK: Come on, Reverend!
REVEREND: Thank God, Braddock!
Braddock!
Braddock!
Heads down, children!
Reverend, get the kids out of here!
REVEREND: Out! Hurry!
We must get away from the truck!
Get down, Reverend!
It's okay.
You don't expect these children
to walk 90 kilometers!
I don't expect a damn thing, Reverend!
But walk or crawl, we're going to make it!
Come on, kids!
VAN: Come on, Reverend.
Braddock... Braddock...
The children are dead tired.
We must stop to rest.
Please, Braddock!
They are not very strong, look.
Wait here.
Reverend! Reverend! Bring the kids! Hurry!
Come, come, children. Quiet. Be quiet.
Braddock! Braddock!
Come, children! Hurry! Hurry!
Come, children!
Be careful! Be careful!
Don't hurt yourselves!
Come!
Go, go!
Come on, kids! Hurry!
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry up!
Thomas!
Hurry!
Sit down and hold on!
Damn it!
Come on!
Hold on!
Braddock, I will kill you,
and I will burn your filthy children!
Braddock!
Hold on.
Oh, my God!
Get back there with the kids, Reverend.
It's gonna get rough.
It's going to be tough.
Mayday, mayday!
Mayday, mayday!
This is Colonel James Braddock,
calling American Military
Assistance Command.
Come in! Mayday, mayday!
Take a seat.
Mayday, mayday! This is Colonel Braddock.
I'm in a crippled C-47.
I have a planeload of Amerasian children.
Losing fuel.
I'm approximately 80 miles
east of the Thai border.
If anyone can hear me,
please transfer the message
to the American Military
Assistance Command.
Is everyone okay back there?
Are you okay?
I'm fine. How are you?
I'm fine, too.
Reverend! We're going down!
Children! Get down!
Hold on! Hold on! Hold on!
We're gonna die!
Just hold on!
Come on, Van.
Help the kids.
Everybody down.
Reverend!
My God! Braddock, there is the border!
As soon as I take the guards out,
you get the kids over the bridge
as fast as you can.
Did you hear what I said?
On my way over here,
I was wondering what you would be like.
I want you to know,
you're everything I wanted in a son.
And I'm very proud of you.
I love you.
All right, men, let's go!
What the hell is happening, Dan?
Braddock and the children.
We intercepted a radio message.
They crashed somewhere near here.
Oh, shit!
Van!
Don't go!
I can't leave him, Dan. I got to help him.
Leave it alone, General. He's on his own.
No one crosses the border.
MAN: All right!
- Daddy!
- Don't go!
Christ!
I got you, Braddock! I got you!
Daddy!
- Oh, no! No, Van! Get back!
- Daddy!
Get back! No! No, please!
You're finished, Braddock! I've won!
They will not dare to cross.
What's he doing?
Hold your position!
He makes one wrong move,
we'll climb up his ass!
You got it.
The Americans are bluffing.
They will not dare do anymore.
Fire! Fire!
There he is!
Oh, Braddock!
Thank God you're alive!
Come on, children!
Thank you.
Thank you.
