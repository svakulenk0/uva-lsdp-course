The relatives...
Those interested in
the ones that disappeared...
in the 42 to 44 Russian front...
go to the right
in group 14.
To the right.
Again, in group 14.
Madam, if no communication
has come from the army...
or the Ministry, means that your
husband dead hasn't been accepted.
So, he's alive
Alive?
Indeed he could be alive.
We believe he's missing.
But, what does missing means?
Can you explain it to me?
I've already told you, he could
be alive, but we don't know it.
Neither do I or his mother!
Not her and not me,
how is this possible?
Madam, officially he's not dead
I already told you.
Then he's alive and I want
to know it and you have to tell me!
You have to tell me, is he alive
or not?  Is he alive?
Sure, you have to tell me.
Is he alive?
I'll bring him to you madam. I don't
want to see you in that black dress.
I'll bring your son, bring him home,
I'm sure.
Even if I have to travel
allover Russia.
Anto...
Anto, are you all right?
The rings!
Have you swallowed a ring?
Now what can I do?
They're made out of gold.
What can I do to swallow it.
Drink!
Where can I find water?
-There, come with me.
It's salty.
The sea is salty.
Well, feel better hope
I digest it... after...
How sweet!
What are talking, I don't
understand you.  Translate.
Where are you from?
From northern Italy,
But where precisely?
From Losguardo a small village
in the country.
Ah! Then you have a country house,
you're a farmer.
Tell me the truth are you a farmer?
Not a farmer, I'm an electrician.
If it wasn't for the war
I would have my electrician degree.
Come on, does my hands look as farmer
hands?  See how soft they are.
Then, there is nothing wrong
with being a farmer.
Was your father a farmer?
No, he was a barber,
quite different!
Just imagine!
While my father was alive,
it wasn't bad...
I had a good life.
Then I went to live with
my sister...
she was married to a good person
I don't complain about work...
I'm good at the kitchen.
Very well!
The sand burns...
How much will burn in Africa?
When does your regiment leaves?
The day after tomorrow, but
don't make me think as...
And you're going to Africa
just because?
Aren't you going to do something
to stay?
What can I do?
There must be a way.
Me, I been thinking all day...
Yes?  So what can we do?
Don't laugh if I tell you.
Won't laugh, tell me.
Let's get married.
Well, with me or any other.
Whoever pleases you.
You'll get 12 days wedding license.
Twelve days will go by and perhaps
then the war is over, who knows?
Or perhaps you won't be sent elsewhere
and you'll be able to remain in Italy.
Summarizing, I'm telling you
for your own good.
Here in Naples everyone
are doing it.
Listen, we're already married.
When
Eh... half an hour ago, here.
Don't joke with this.
See, I'm 32-years-old and
unmarried, I will never marry.
I can see that you haven't found
someone that you like.
Have found more than twenty.
Mean, ugly, blond, redhead...
rich, poor...
but when I smell church, I run.
Just imagine! Me marrying
a Neapolitan!
Then go to Africa, to war, to heat
and to scorpions...
tell the angels to care for you
and goodbye.
You know what?  Better scorpions
than marriage!
And who's getting married?
What a head!  I forgot to give you
the present!
-They are for me?
-Yes.
Madonna, they're beautiful!
Do you like them?
I love them!
Thanks.
But your mother should have come to
the wedding.  No one does that.
It hurts me more for you
than for me.
Don't worry.  My mother is old, stubborn.
Imagine that she thinks that
I'll marry for money.
Money?  What money?  I have nothing,
but you went crazy for me.
Be patient.  When we have a child
she'll love the kid and you.
I don't want only one child,
I want a large family.
And this?  Too much water, Holy Mother!
Don't be mean!
What are you doing?
Anto!
What are those bells?
Anto!
Anto!
What are those bells?
What time it is?
Seven.
Seven in the morning or afternoon?
Who knows...
It's "rinning"...
Translate!
It's raining
Can't deduce if its morning
or afternoon.
There are people going to Church.
What? Is Sunday?
Surely.
But, what do we care?
How come we don't care?
We arrived on Thursday.
Let me see... Sunday was yesterday!
Then today must be Monday.
Monday... then we have only 8 days!
It's a wedding, the husband is a soldier.
Holy Mother, I forgot
is Alfredo that works with me.
He invited me to the wedding.
Where is my head!
But this Alfredo also married for a license?
I don't know.  Could be.
Tell me the truth!
Isn't because you married me
only for the license?
Don't be stupid, I married you
because I love you.
But you were not sure,
you were afraid.
You said that marriage
gave you chills. -Yes.
And now, are you scare?
Giovanna, we need to cover the
windows, otherwise we'll get a fine.
They say that the alarm has been given.
Still 6? Ah! it stopped.
It's night must be one o'clock.
I don't want anything illegal!
Are you hungry?
I'll prepare some pasta.
No, you don't move from here.
Today I'm cooking.
What? You know how to cook?
What, haven't told you?
I'm a magician in the kitchen.
Come on.
What are you doing?
A Frittata.
How many eggs?
And who eats 24 eggs?
My grandmother, my grandmother...
I've eaten with my grandmother
the morning after the milling.
Understood?
Lard.
Lard? In these times,
where do you find lard?
Besides Frittata is done with oil.
My mother does it with lard.
Your mother is wrong
as is done with oil.
By the way, she's sick
with bronchitis
The bronchitis she catch it on purpose
to not meet us.
Don't say that.
Salt.
This is an ugly salt.
Pepper.
Scientific.
Tools.
The military service has spoiled me.
Lost my practice.
Looks like gold,
pure gold!
My father soul was what
took care of us all.
He was a champ!
A true deli that you have to taste.
It's ready.
Me too.
The glasses.
Do you like it?
Yes.
Has good aroma.
To us!
Then dessert.
What?
No "mo", no "mo".
Translate!
Can't talk!
It's okay...
because I love you much.
What a heat! It's suffocating.
I can't breath.
You're revolting... eh!
But, how my grandfather
did it?
I don't want to see an egg for a month.
Me for a year.
Luckily, I did add onion.
I'll throw this away.
Yes, take it out of my sight.
And this, where it came from?
Perhaps my mother sent it.
She knocked the door
and we didn't notice.
What are you doing?
You're not leaving them outside,
they're my mother's eggs.
I don't want to look at them,
at least for 10 years.
And now? Shall we go out?
And were to?
Let's go to take some fresh air.
Oh! Sunrise.
At this hour my father was on the fields.
You have no strength in your legs.
What are you saying! I'm stronger than you.
I never thought you were that strong.
What are you laughing for?
The eggs.
No, I beg you, my stomach
is about to explode.
I close the eyes and see so many eggs.
Don't close them then.
But even if I open my eyes
I see them
Flares!
Be careful!
Stay calm. It's over.
I wasn't afraid.
You made me understand...
so many things, Anto.
I want to be with you forever.
Even if it was in the mountains.
How many days have gone by, Anto?
Eight.
No, ten.
Two days!
Only two days.
Help me!
I'll kill you.
Help me!
Stay still, stay still.
Poor woman.
I'll kill everyone!
Anto! What are you doing?
What happened?
Nothing, nothing.
How come nothing?
Nothing... nothing.
Don't know what overcome him.
He was calm and then...
he gets white,
the eyes full of fury...
then comes and puts both hands
in the neck, like this...
Had a really bad time!
When coming, he fell to the floor...
as people says,
I pour him cold water.
He locked himself in the kitchen
and didn't want to come out.
He was yelling,
Dammed the day I married.
What a misfortune. Maybe is over.
Sergeant, here he is!
Antonio
Wait!
Wait a moment!
I'll make him to come out.
Wait a moment!
No, no I'll make him to come out,
they won't do any to you I swear...
Don't harm him!
Antonio, come out,
they won't harm you I swear...
Do you her me, Antonio...
Anto.
Release me!
Don't harm him!
I want the Director.
I want to know why I'm inside here.
I'm Saint Joseph.
Yes, he's Saint Joseph, I guarantee it!
Come, madam.
You, you're as crazy as me.
Doctor!
You're lucid and can chose between
a process or voluntary leave to Russia.
Stop!  The first squad
gets into the train to the right...
The second squad into the
train to the left...
You have 15 minutes.
Dismiss!
Giovanna we have 15 mins.
Come, come.
Giovanna!
Yes.
I'll come back from Russia soon, you'll see.
Yes.
I'll bring you a fur.
Yes.
The war is over!
Hey! come here. What are you saying?
What is over?  -The war.
Do you know him?
Do you know him?
Maria!  Maria!
Do you know him?
But this is Antonio.
Is he alive?
We were together. Is he alive?
Possibly, I don't know
How do you know?
Stop!
Can't walk, I've been waiting
for this moment many years...
Have to find someone
that tells me about him...
that has seen him,
that met him
Listen, can't be standing up,
come here.
Is he alive?
Tell me, where have you seen him?
Where did you left him the last time?
Where is he?
We were together...
Where?
There, in the mountains.
It was January, an awful month.
The Russians had positioned and we
had to take them out no matter what...
We can't imagine, madam, what
snow is if you haven't been to Russia
Madam, you stay still for 3 mins
and you froze...
Meanwhile the Russians came from
everywhere.  It was hell my lady.
We have been inside hell.
The snow, the ice, the wind that cut
your face, thirst, hunger.
Always sleepless, night and day...
a true hell my lady.
I don't feel my hands. Dam it.
Here everything is burned.
Where are we going?
Look!
Close that door!
I can't stand it more!
Come on, stand up!
Then, when we escape from the ravine
we walk many kilometers in the snow.
Anto!  Come on stand up!
Have strength!
Walk!
Anto, you should walk!
Otherwise you'll froze.
When I turned around, he signaled me
to go on, to not think about him
That's the last time I saw him.
You never saw him again?
And you left him there in the snow,
without giving him a had, in the cold...
What can I do?
Wasn't anybody there to help you?
What kind of people are they?
I don't know.
Perhaps someone could help you.
Listen...
Come inside, I'll prepare coffee.
No, coffee makes me sick,
can't drink it.
I'm happy to see you.
Want some water?
No, thanks, no.
Some cakes?
No, please, no.
Sit down.
He's alive, I can feel it, he's not dead.
But if he's alive, why hasn't he written?
To you or me?
Why he hasn't come back, as many others?
I will go, I go.
Now they say that things have changed.
That now isn't impossible
They say you can go there.
I'll try.
Even if it was impossible
I will try the same.
To Russia?
Yes, yes to Russia.
So many have tried and didn't make it...
This is the last photo he send me...
Look madam...
He probably was hot with
that many clothes...
What are you saying...
if a soldier does not cover like this
he dies...
He's alive.
Spaziva, that's how you say it?
Yes, Spaziva.
Here some Italian soldiers and
Russian civilians, the Germans make them
dig their own graves.
See madam...
each sunflower, each tree, each
grain field hides the bodies...
of Italian soldiers, Russians, Germans
and also the bodies of many...
Russian peasants, old, women, children.
I'm sure that my husband is not there.
Antonio is alive.
You have to find peace for your heart, madam.
There are no Italians alive in Russia.
It cannot be!
Alive Italians for sure.
Wounded, some that lost their memory.
Why not? It happens, no?
Me, I know one that came to Moscow
to a soccer game
have seen one of those Italians.
I have spoken to them.
And what did he say?
No idea what he said.
I know, it is true.
Holy Mother...
This gravestone recalls his fellowmen.
Belongs to a Russian poet.
Young man from Naples, what
brings you to this Russian field...
Weren't you happy in your
motherland...
Me, that I found you
jailed in Moscow...
so far away from your land...
Are you Italian?
Italian?
No.
You are Italian.
Anyone can tell because your
hair, your eyes, everything.
But how can you be ashamed of
being Italian?  Why you're ashamed?
It is true?
I came here searching for my husband.
But I can't find if he's alive or dead.
You're Italian.
Where are you from?
I was Italian, now I'm Russian.
Why?
Because... because...
It's a long story...
the because certain things...
happen and that's enough.
No, I don't know him.
I was an alpine man...
If I find something
I swear I'll tell you
Why don't you go home?
Which home?
No.
Do you know him?
Do you know him?
Have you seen him?
Good day!
I know nothing.
It's too hard!
I'm very tired!
Antonio was a dead body.
Almost dead
He was...
frozen.
Antonio...
has forgotten everything.
Everything, do you understand?
and I was always near,
always to cure him.
Come.
I don't want to see you anymore!
I don't want to see you anymore!
No you wouldn't... no.
That's not the way is done!
It's not done like this!
But, why are you afraid?
No, I'm cold.
Let's take a ride by the village,
do you want to?
Since when do you drive a motorcycle?
Since I was a kid.
Are we going down?
No, it is flat.
There is nothing to be afraid,
I'm an ace driving.
Shall we go to the river?
Yes, let's go.
Dam!
But are you crazy?
The dam thing didn't brake!
But as I say, straight into the river
who could imagine?
We should thank that
nothing happened to us.
I knew I shouldn't come.
If you told me that never before
you ride a motorcycle...
All right, but is this the way to do it?
There it is!
Take.
Where are you going?
Home and I walk.
Wait!
Don't say!
Want to come in?
Want to sit down?
Did you pull out Antonio?
Yes.
It's better... it would have been better
if he's dead!
Better for me, better for you,
better for everyone...
Madam, he's alive,
has a house, a woman
and a little girl.
Antonio!
You like to meddle into
gossip...
do not forget what is
more convenient for you.
Hi!
Hello, Giovanna.
Who's speaking?
Giovanna, it's me, Antonio.
I'm Antonio
Giovanna!
Where are you?
I'm here in Milan.
I came looking for you.
Giovanna, when can I see you?
How did you find me?
Went to the village and they
gave me your phone number.
I don't want to see you.
I don't want to see you.
No. One moment,
just one moment.
I have come from so far away!
Me too I have traveled so much...
day, night until I find you
don't make me tell you.
Anto...
I'm not either alone.
Are you with someone?
Yes.
He's a factory worker...
Now he's at the factory
has the night shift.
Then we will not met. I'm leaving
like if we have never talked...
is better like this.
Anyway we have nothing to do
you have another woman...
and with another woman, I don't
want to know anything about you
Then, goodbye Giovanna...
Goodbye Anto... goodbye.
Excuse me...
The strike also applies
to international trains?
Where are you going?
To Vienna.
You have to take it tomorrow
morning at 6.
Is there another way to do it?
What do you mean?
I have seen a bus service.
Yes but they go to Torino, Verona, Novara
Bologna, won't take you there
Everything is a mess with this strike.
Look there is a bus service that
substitutes the train,  is about to leave.
But where do I have to go?
Sorry, I believed...
Saw you buying a present and...
Ah! the doll, no, is for me.
I like them.
Don't you like them?
Listen, can you tell me
about a nearby hotel?
Could be The Galia, but...
No, a cheap hotel.
No.
Want to sleep with me?
Where?
There nearby.
Where are you from?
and where are you?
Do you have a phone?
Yes, here near the door.
Antonio?
Yes, listen...
Lost my train, can't leave
until tomorrow...
I want to see you, I have to speak
with you, tell me where are you?
Ambrosio Giovagnoli Plaza 42.
Wait, wait I've to write
the address.
Excuse me, do you have
a pencil I have to write...
Only an eye pencil.
Tell me? Repeat the address.
Ambrosio Giovagnoli Plaza 42,
third floor apartment 8.
Thanks.
Listen, how to I call a taxi?
What, a taxi?
Why?  Are you leaving?
Yes.
But I got naked and
the mirror is dirty.
How much you charge?
It's dark, meeting like this in
the dark after so much time.
Please let me in.
I'll leave soon.
Yes, sorry.
I'll look for a candle.
Where did I put it?
You're all wet.
No, it's nothing...
Can't believe you're here.
Listen, Giovanna
I have to explain everything.
I wanted to kill myself, but I
understood that you can live without love.
It's true...
don't know if you know what happened.
I had in front of me,
one thousand kms of snow.
When I opened my eyes...
I was in a house
an unknown house
with a woman I have
never seen before
and I couldn't remember
a thing...
for a long time I couldn't
remember a thing.
All you're saying I already know it.
She saved your life.  She healed you
and gave you everything you needed.
You should have given her many
thanks and come back here.
Instead you stayed...
and had a child with her.
I felt that it was the only...
safe place available for me.
Do you love her?
For me...
it has been...
as if I was dead...
and afterwards, I was
someone else.
Death so close,
changes people.
Changes, changes the feelings
Don't know how to explain...
Me, with her...
I found some peace.
How can I make you understand.
I came because I believed that...
easily I could explain you everything.
War is ugly.
Has been...
Has been like that...
ugly, Giovanna.
Has been difficult...
Don't know why it happened.
I look for a candle.
Don't look at me like that.
I've aged.
You also have become an old man.
Everything is a disaster.
How much white hair!
Antonio!
Come back to me.
I still love you.
And you still love me,
I can feel it.
How could I go back to you?
How could I go back to you?
The baby.
Have you understood, Anto?
But I can't leave you like this.
I'll take you with me.
We will forge a new life
in any place.
And where would you take me
with this child?
And you also have a daughter.
We will ruin the kids and you.
Love
What's his name?
Antonio.
Like me.
No, Antonio like Saint Anthony.
I brought you...
I promised you.
