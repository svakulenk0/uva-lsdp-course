Hey. How's it going, Danny?
It's going great, Uncle Len.
Good, good, good.
I'm going to need those chairs
for the wedding reception
tomorrow night.
They going to be ready?
They'll be ready.
Good, good.
Is everything okay, Danny?
Yeah.
I was just...
You know, listening
to the party upstairs.
It just sounded like fun.
Yeah.
It's a group of soldiers
shipping out tomorrow morning.
They deserve to have some fun
their last night here.
Just wish I was
going with them.
I know.
Well, you be thankful
that that polio didn't leave
you with more than a limp.
For a while there,
none of us thought you
were going to make it.
Sometimes I wish I hadn't.
Oh, you don't mean that.
Think of what
that would've done.
But now all I am
is a useless cripple,
a useless 4-F cripple.
Useless?
Look at
this fine workmanship, Danny.
This is a gift.
Look what you can
do with your hands?
Yeah, but I'd rather have
a rifle in my hands,
going after the Japs
or the Krauts.
I know.
Is Mr. Toulon
still staying here?
Yeah, he's
in his room upstairs.
Wonderful old man.
He was in Europe, you know.
He was fighting the Nazis.
Well, that's what he says,
but sometimes I think
he's prone to tall tales.
No, Uncle Len, it's true.
You know,
the Nazis killed his wife?
Mr. Toulon said the Nazis
wanted to steal his puppets,
so now he even has
a special hiding place
so they don't fall
into the wrong hands.
It's because he has
a secret.
He can make them move
without the strings.
No, Uncle Len,
it's true, really.
I've seen it.
Come to think of it,
maybe he has some work
for you. Huh?
Maybe you could help him
with those puppets of his,
repairing them, fixing them up,
that sort of thing.
Have you thought of that?
I guess you're right.
I suppose I could ask him.
You should.
After you're done here,
I'm not going to have
any work for you,
not for a while anyway.
And if I worked
for Mr. Toulon,
Your mother
needs to see you, Danny.
She misses you.
So does your brother.
Yeah, I know.
I miss them, too,
but...
But...
But you don't want
to be cooped up here
with your old uncle,
either, huh?
Well, you'd rather be
overseas fighting.
Hopefully the war
will be over soon
and we won't need
to fight anymore.
I'm going to let you get
back to your work, Danny.
I'll tell the cooks to have
dinner prepared for you
in the kitchen
when you're done, huh?
How would that be, huh?
Thank you, Uncle Len.
Okay.
Mr. Toulon?
You all right?
Mr. Toulon?
Oh, my God.
What the devil?
Danny.
Mom.
Great to see you.
I didn't think you'd be
back till next week.
Your Uncle Lenny said...
Oh, yeah, we finished early.
What's all this?
Oh, it's just something
I'm working on.
I'll take it over to my room.
Oh, leave it.
Let me have a look at you.
I swear you've gotten taller.
Mom, I've only been gone
for three weeks.
But for sure
you've lost weight.
Sit down.
Let me get some food in you.
Nonsense.
Leave it.
Sit down.
I'll fix you up
a quick lunch.
Look out!
Did that Uncle Len spoil you
with that 20-year-old Scotch
of his?
Come on, you know
I didn't get any Scotch.
What?
Oh, that's right.
You're an Ovaltine man.
Very funny, very funny.
Don't ship out
for another week.
Do you know
where you're going yet?
Not yet.
I hope not Japan.
It would be like we live
there already,
Oh, hush, Donny.
They're Chinese,
not Japanese.
What's the difference?
They've never given us
a lick of trouble
in all the years
we've been here.
Yeah, well, after the war,
I'm going to make enough money
to get you out of Chinatown.
I'm hoping
they send me to Europe.
Wow, the Jerries.
Yeah, I'd love to get
my hands on them.
It's cold over there
right now, though.
I'm going to freeze
my ass off.
And you've got to watch out
for those Panzer tanks
of theirs.
Oh, yeah.
Enough talk about the war.
What else is there
to talk about?
How about baseball
or this nice weather
we're having?
Mom, come on. The war is
what matters right now.
I just don't like
to think about it.
That's all.
Getting hurt over there.
I'll be okay, Mom.
God willing.
Look, you know I wish
I was going over there
with you, right?
I know, little brother.
Think about what
that would do to Mom.
You know, the Mitchells
down the street,
they got three boys serving...
Yeah, and have you seen
Mrs. Mitchell lately?
Looks like she's aged
We can't do that to Mom.
Handle what better, dear?
No, no, I don't
want to be stuck here.
Look, I love you, Mom,
and I'd be going over
to serve
if I wasn't
a goddamn cripple.
Hey.
Danny.
Well, it's true.
You may think
your leg is a curse,
but to me it's a blessing.
Well, the Army doesn't know
what they're talking about.
Honey.
Nobody's saying
you can't, Dan.
Just the way the ball bounced.
You have to do what you can
from here in the home front.
Like what,
restoring furniture?
No, no, I think
you got something.
Why don't you build
a special chair for Hitler?
He goes to sit down, and wham!
A spear goes
right into his ass.
Don.
You he could make these things
move without strings?
I saw it.
I don't know. There's
nothing cheap about it.
That's why I think
he killed himself.
Because he didn't want
to hand over his secret
to those Nazis.
Nazis?
Come on, you're telling me
that Nazis made the trip
all the way here
to take some little puppets
from an old man?
That's a little far-fetched
even for you, little brother.
It's not the puppets
that they wanted.
It's the secret
to whatever makes them move.
Yeah, well,
I think you've been reading
too many of those pulps.
Huh.
What's this?
Oh, that's one Mr. Toulon
was trying to repair.
Six arms, huh?
That's what we need
against the Krauts.
Take that, you dirty Nazis.
I don't even need a gun
to kill those bastards.
You know how great I am
at sneaking up on people.
Please, you don't
have to remind me.
I stained my shorts
when you got me earlier.
Yeah.
If they send me to Japan,
I'll use my skills to sneak up
on those Japs in the jungle...
And slit
their yellow throats.
Yeah, I bet you would.
Hey, there's a Duke double bill
downtown tonight.
You want to go?
Come on, forget the puppets.
They're not going anywhere.
Let's have some fun together.
I'm only here
for another week.
Call up that cute girl
of yours. What's her name?
Beth.
Beth. She's a dame, huh?
Hey, have her bring her sister
if she's got one.
Hm?
All right.
Yes?
We are looking
for Roland Tomasi.
Tomasi is dead.
Leave your dramatic
gestures to me.
A woman?
Your astonishment
is refreshing.
I would advise
against using your weapon.
We're here to contact Tomasi.
What happened to him?
As you know,
Tomasi was a traitor
as an American,
a fascist sympathizer,
a fifth columnist
willing to ally himself
with the Germans,
such as yourself,
as well as the Japanese.
However, his treachery
extended extended to those
he allied himself with.
When he betrayed me
in a simple matter,
well, he met
with an unfortunate end.
I have taken over his plan
to strike at the heart
of the American war effort.
You're willing to stay
if you wish,
or you may leave unharmed.
Klaus and I could
just as easily take over
this plan as you.
You mean
if you kill me and my men,
but more likely
we'd all kill each other.
What purpose would that serve?
The Germans and the Japanese
are not friends,
yet we share a common enemy.
Perhaps we can work together.
Sake?
To making the American swine
bleed.
Let me ask you something.
Why is a Japanese woman...
And I mean a beautiful
Japanese woman...
Hiding in an opera house
in the heart of Chinatown?
What better place
for a Japanese to hide?
Americans can't tell
any of us apart anyway.
Your English
is very practiced,
very convincing.
May have to do something
with the hair,
but it might work.
Yes, it might just work.
You all have
these little holes.
Why is that?
Oh, no, Beth.
I'm late, I know.
Again. My lunch hour
is almost over.
Sorry.
Chocolates.
Well, at least
that's something to eat.
I really am sorry, Beth.
I just got to working
on those puppets
and kind
of lost track of time.
Like Pinocchio, huh?
Don't be silly.
What's this?
Ben? Anybody I should be
worried about?
He's just one of the guys
on the floor
thanking me for getting
his hours shifted around.
Mm-hm, you sure that's all?
Because I think I see your nose
growing there, Pinocchio.
Hush, you're my man,
and you know it, Danny Coogan.
See?
So you're been playing
around with puppets, huh?
Is that your excuse, Coogan?
Hello, Mr. Gifford.
You're late
for your lunch date
because you're playing
around with puppets.
No, it's not that.
Oh, save it.
You'll learn
your lesson soon enough
when some quicker guy
is on the draw.
Yeah, I know.
I'm trying to run a plant.
I'm doing something
for the war effort.
What happens if my invoices
don't get filed
and one of my secretaries
keels over from starvation?
It's okay, Mr. Gifford,
really. I don't mind.
Yeah, well, I do.
I don't like you, Coogan.
A young guy like you
should be fighting
in the war,
not playing
with stupid puppets.
I would be fighting,
Mr. Gifford.
I want to be fighting,
Oh, stop bawling.
I lied about my age
so I could go over to France
and fight for my country,
so stop whining
about your goddamn leg.
Why, you...
Yeah. You better think twice,
Coogan.
Lucky you got your girl here
to save your ass.
You got 10 more minutes,
Beth.
Yes, Mr. Gifford.
Don't mind him, Danny.
He doesn't know
what he's talking about.
Yes, he does.
What do you mean?
He's right.
But your leg.
I should've lied,
like he did.
I should find
some way around it
instead of sitting around here
feeling sorry for myself.
Danny, don't.
That jerk Gifford
is right about Beth.
She's not going to wait around
for a guy like me.
What does a great girl
like that want with
a cripple anyway?
She had flowers on her desk
from some guy at the plant,
probably some guy
with big muscles,
who's really handsome,
some guy who's going
to do his time at the plant
and go over and serve,
some guy way better than me.
Look at me.
There's a war going on
out there,
and I'm stuck here talking
with a bunch of stupid puppets
all because of this game leg.
I should be able
to fix you right up.
What is that?
Oh, my God.
You are alive.
How do you...
How do you like it?
What island?
Uh...
You've got to be quiet, okay?
We're going to surprise her.
Look, I'm even
on time for lunch.
Can you believe it?
You've got to be still now,
all right?
What is it?
What's wrong?
Hey, honey.
Wow, you're right on time
for lunch.
Let me call Ripley's.
Who was that guy?
Who?
The guy who was just in here.
Who was that?
That's Ben.
I told you before.
He's one of the guys
that works on the floor.
He just needs somebody
to talk to sometimes.
That's all.
Yeah, well...
There's nothing
to be jealous about.
Well, I bet you
his name isn't Ben.
What are you talking about?
Your friend?
He's one of the guys
who killed Mr. Toulon
up an the inn
a couple weeks ago.
Remember
I told you about it?
Yes, but Ben?
His name isn't Ben.
He's a Nazi.
Don't be ridiculous.
I saw his face, Beth.
He bumped into me
when I was going
to help Mr. Toulon.
I mean, he looks
a little bit different,
but that's definitely him.
I'm sure of it.
Ben, a Nazi?
You're being paranoid,
honey.
I'm not being paranoid.
All of his papers
are in order.
I checked them myself.
Besides, he's not from Germany,
silly.
He's from Burbank,
for heaven's sake.
What's in the bag?
Nothing. I mean,
what does it matter?
You don't believe me anyway.
Danny, don't be like that.
Come on, just show me.
He's a Nazi,
and I'll prove it to you.
Danny.
Big Ben.
Brooklyn Dodgers going
all the way this year.
Oh, I've got to go
with St. Louis.
You've got to be kidding me.
Bunch of rummies,
those guys.
We'll see about that.
Want to make it interesting?
Let's talk tomorrow.
Yeah, yeah.
Have a safe night.
Heil Hitler.
I knew it.
Hitler-loving Nazi scum.
For nearly a week,
you have been entrenched
within the enemy's
own back yard.
No difficulties?
None.
I've even made a few friends.
All I have to do is badmouth
us Krauts
or especially you Japs,
and I fit right in.
Oh, and talk about baseball,
and this is the toughest part.
Strikes, runs, errors...
Damn ridiculous sport.
It all sounds promising,
very promising.
So were you able
to procure the item?
I've been flirting
with the cute girl
that sits in the office.
And she suspects nothing?
She's quite taken by me.
What can I say?
It must be my good looks.
You Germans
are far too satisfied
with yourselves.
Confidence.
After charming the girl,
it was an easy thing
to snoop through her office
when she was out
with her boss.
Good, very good.
This appears
to be the loading bay.
Let's see
what you guys can do.
And this...
That is a storage room
that's always locked.
No one is allowed in there.
It must be where
they are keeping their
secret ingredient.
Ingredient?
Yeah.
Tomasi had a theory
the Americans are planning
to use a new material.
We do not know
what it is called,
but it doesn't matter.
This new material
and the secret storage room
appears to be right
next to the break room.
Perfect. Perfect.
It is a simple device,
but powerful.
Set the timer and walk away.
A perfect fit.
In two days,
when you go to work,
leave it in the break room,
set the timer, and exit.
The explosion will ignite
the storage room,
detonating this secret
material with it.
Setting off
a chain reaction.
The entire facility,
the workers,
and all the new bombs inside
will be engulfed in moments,
crippling their war efforts.
I admire your planning,
lovely Ozu.
And you, Max,
on your subterfuge.
The puppets.
Get them.
Get that boy!
The puppets.
Puppets?
The old man's puppets.
Toulon's, the one
we were sent here to find.
He killed himself...
A true coward...
Looks like you got in
a pretty good lick.
Damn Nazis.
Honey? What's
all the noise in here?
Uh, nothing, Mom.
I'm sorry if I woke you.
I heard you come home.
It's late.
Is everything okay?
All right.
Well, be sure you're home
for dinner tomorrow night.
We're having
a little celebration
for your brother.
He ships out soon, you know.
Yeah, I know. I'll be here.
All right, good night.
Night.
Came out okay, too.
These are blueprints
to the plant
where Beth works.
That Nazi's
been imitating a Yank
so he can get access
to the plant.
He's planning on blowing it up.
We've got to find a way
to stop them.
I knew I could
count on you guys.
What are you doing up?
I couldn't sleep.
Oh, wow.
That sandwich looks great.
Did you leave some for me?
Yeah, there's plenty.
Oh, good.
Hey, Don,
can I talk to you really quick?
Hey, little brother, let me
get some of that grub in me,
and them I am all ears
for you, okay?
Oh.
Excuse me, madam.
It's nice to meet you.
You've been drinking.
Just a few.
Went down to the Duke
double bill downtown.
Again?
We just saw that last week.
And then... then we went
to McGinty's.
Oh, that's where I saw
this girl.
Whoo, her name was Gale, and...
Or Marsha.
Uh...
Anyways, little brother,
the gams on this girl...
I mean, they were
up to her neck.
Whoo-hee-hee.
Shh.
Oh... Oh, shh-shh.
Don't wake Mom.
Hey... Hey, how's your girl?
How's that going?
I don't know.
What? What's wrong?
I just don't think
it's going to work out.
All those guys
down at the plant, they
all got their eye on her.
So what?
You've just got to make sure
that you're the only one
she's thinking about.
One of those other guys
gets in the way,
you just pow.
Show them who's boss,
right?
Yeah, I guess so.
Don't you forget that.
Okay?
Sure, Don.
Mm.
Now, what is it you wanted
to tell me about those dolls?
They're puppets.
Oh, sorry.
Those puppets.
What about them?
Oh, forget it.
I'll tell you later.
You sure?
Yeah.
All right.
Mm.
No, he's right.
Even though I can't
go overseas and fight,
I can still do my bit
right here at home.
Somebody's got to stop those
guys from blowing up the plant,
right?
You guys with me?
Come in.
Hey, sweetie.
Wow, you look great.
And for my own
special soldier.
Thanks, honey.
Are you okay?
Oh, yeah.
Look, forget about all that.
I'm sorry
I was being such a jerk.
Oh, come here, though.
I need to show you something.
Yeah.
There are bigger problems.
What do you mean?
It looks like a blueprint.
Uh-huh, to the plant.
But... ...
How did you get this?
From your new friend Ben.
What?
Yeah, I followed him
last night,
after he got off work,
and he went to this
opera house in Chinatown,
not that far from here
and three Japs.
One of them
was this dragon lady,
and they're all
in this together, Beth.
In what together?
They're planning
on blowing up the plant.
They had a bomb.
You're really serious,
aren't you?
And they're planning
on putting it here,
near the field depot.
When?
Two days from now.
Look, I overheard everything.
If this is true,
you've got to tell somebody.
Yeah, and who's
going to believe me?
I have enough trouble
getting you to believe me,
let alone anyone else.
I'm the boy who cried Nazi.
So what are you going to do?
I'm going down there,
to that opera house.
Danny.
Don't worry.
I'm just going to take
some pictures.
I'll make somebody believe me,
and I'll be all right.
I've got help.
Who?
They won't hurt you.
Oh, my God.
How are they moving?
It's Toulon's secret.
I found it.
It's all right.
Yeah, go ahead.
I'm so sorry, Danny.
Sorry for what?
Look, I need you to stay here
and help Mom with the party.
If she wonders where I am,
just make up some excuse.
I'm worried you're be hurt,
Danny.
With these guys helping me,
I'll be all right,
and don't worry.
Like I said, I'm just going
to take some pictures.
*
Infernal racket.
I take it you are upset.
Stay calm, Buddha.
Klaus!
What's happening here?
Nothing more.
Isn't that right,
my dear Klaus?
We don't have time
for this nonsense.
Our mission
may be in jeopardy.
Because of the boy?
He can't know anything.
If he does,
he must be taken care of.
How?
I've been on the phone
with the Bodega Bay Inn.
It seems our boy
was restoring furniture
for them
during his stay.
His address...
here in Los Angeles,
not far from where we are.
Once again, fate at work.
Get the boy and his puppets.
Let nothing stand in our way.
Heil Hitler.
F r der F hrer.
Perhaps we should celebrate
our upcoming victory, Ozu.
What did you
have in your mind,
my dear Max?
Maybe something to unite
our partnership.
Do not mistake me
as a Western harlot
or one of your German whores
who find your arrogance
arousing.
Have I made my point clear,
my dear Maximilian?
How's it coming in there,
dear?
Let me take those.
Well, if you think so.
I know so. Go on.
Okay. Um...
You frightened me.
What are you doing, sneaking
around like Béla Lugosi?
That's what I do, Ma.
Don, you weren't supposed
to be home until 6.
You ruined the surprise.
Oh. Oh, look at that.
It's nice. Thanks.
But what's
Danny going to think?
What do you mean? He knows
we're having the party.
Yeah, but he wishes
he was going over there
to fight with the rest of us.
This is just going to remind him
that he's not going.
You guys should have
the party for him, too.
We are. I've got
a few surprises for him.
I'm going to wear
a new dress that I bought.
Plus I made him
his favorite apple pie.
Ooh.
The pie!
I've already taken
the pie out, hon.
It's perfect.
You're a life saver.
Where is Danny anyway?
Wood staining stuff?
You know, whatever he uses
for his job.
Oh, yeah, hammer and nails,
all that technical jazz.
You.
We'll call you
when it's ready.
You guys are shipping me out
before I get shipped out.
Oh, that must be the mailman
with that package
from Aunt Jane.
Yes? Can I help you?
With these pictures,
Bring these bastards down
in no time.
Oh, no.
Mom.
Oh, God.
I'm sorry that I wasn't here.
Don. Don!
Don, hang on.
I'll go get help. Hang on.
No, there's no time,
little brother.
He took Beth.
I know that.
You stay still.
Save your strength, okay?
You go get them.
You... go get them.
Don?
Don?
Don?
No, Don.
I'm going to get
those bastards, Don.
And you're going to help me.
So part of you
can keep on living, okay?
Just as long as you don't mind
being inside a Jap.
Please work.
Toulon.
Come on.
How do you feel?
You know, we can really
use those sneaking skills
of yours.
Here.
Wow.
Stop! Touch her again,
it'll be the last thing
you remember.
I apologize
for their conduct.
You're no better
than they are.
To you, perhaps,
it may seem that way,
but, again,
I apologize.
I don't care
about your apologies.
By now, of course,
you know my name is not Ben.
You're a Nazi,
just like Danny said.
A soldier following orders.
For Hitler.
The leader
of the new world.
Not if our boys have
anything to say about it.
What's going on here?
Your men are savages.
They are men
with the needs and desires
of men.
I see,
Yet the desires of you men,
your animals, must be granted?
Is that it?
Don't be jealous.
It does not
befit a leader.
We tied the girl here
in the center of the stage
so that no one can
attempt to free her
without our seeing.
I understand,
but does that mean
she must be toyed with?
Why do you care?
She's nothing but bait.
Does not
a dead worm on a hook
still attract a fish?
She is not a worm.
You seem to have developed
feelings for this little tramp.
Do not let this cloud
your judgment.
I hope you don't expect me
to thank you.
No, I don't expect you
to understand, either.
What don't I understand?
You can never understand
the cause of which
I am fighting for.
The slaughtering
of innocent people
by a mad dictator?
That's not a cause.
That's evil.
You'll never defeat
freedom and democracy.
Perhaps in a different time
and a different life
we could've meant something
to each other.
I'd rather be dead.
You may just get your wish.
Good job.
Can your hear me?
Can you?
Excellent. Yes.
It is going well here,
Commander.
Yes, he will be killed.
As will the two Germans.
And we will take
the boy's secret,
the one the Germans
are so eager to control.
Yes, it will belong
to Japan...
to the Emperor.
Hello?
Hello, Commander?
You'll never win the war.
You might kill me and Danny.
Even if you blow up the plant,
you still won't win.
Does your mother know
what you do for a living?
I bet if she did,
she'd be ashamed of you.
Not that you care, of course.
You've probably been
a disappointment to her
your whole life, haven't you?
Ever since you were
a German boy
pulling the wings
off of German flies.
She probably did the best
she could, didn't she?
But you're hopeless.
The boy, he's here.
And here I thought
my wardrobe was extravagant.
What you call extravagance
I call pride.
You Nazis,
Let's go.
It seems your men have proven
to be quite useless.
If these two are an example
of Japan's finest,
your country has no hope
for winning this war.
They were killed by magic.
There is no defense
against sorcery.
They were killed by a boy
and his puppets.
Danny.
Oh, thank God.
I... You...
and Don...
I know. I know.
I'm so sorry.
It's okay.
Don's still here in spirit,
and he wouldn't want us
crying right now.
We'll both cry about it later,
okay?
Right now we've got
to get you out of here.
Okay? That's my girl.
Come on.
Klaus!
Your man proved to be
no more efficient than my own.
It appears
only you and I remain.
We must find them
before they escape.
You take the rear.
I will guard the front.
For the Emperor.
F r der F hrer.
We shall see.
We've got to go, Tunneler.
You have performed admirably,
but now it's over for you.
What's in the bag?
Drop it, boy.
Danny.
It'll be okay.
American surrenders.
Very good.
Ninja?
Are we not come
from the same cloth, Ninja?
Aah! Aah!
No!
The F hrer
will be very pleased.
Looking for something?
Where's the bomb?
There's no way we're going
to let you blow up the plant.
Where is it?
The timer's counting down!
Yeah,
and he'll flip the switch
and set it off
before the timer goes, too,
unless, maybe,
you want to be blown up.
Isn't that what
your kamikaze pilots do?
They blow themselves up
for the cause.
Dedicated and brave.
Okay.
To nosedive your airplane
into the belly of a battleship.
But brave?
I don't know about that.
Think about it.
We aren't the ones
holding the bomb.
Order it to move away
from the bomb.
No.
Besides, I don't think
he likes you very much,
and I know he doesn't like
the German.
After all, the Germans killed
his master, Mr. Toulon.
The sorcery
is truly powerful.
And that's why you'll never
get your hands on it.
Do not be so confident.
You've done well
up to this point, boy,
much better
than I ever could've
expected from a cripple.
But victory is far
from assured.
You'll still never
get the secret.
Once again you speak
before victory is in hand.
Danny,
he's got the puppet.
I knew our alliance
would prove to be
fruitful, my dear.
Step away, dear.
Lay down your sword.
I should've known
that Nazis cannot be trusted.
You have no code of honor.
Well, I have the puppets
and the gun, so stay back!
The serum
that's in those puppets
will only last
a limited time.
Where's the rest of it?
It's hidden.
Then you will
take me to it.
Like hell.
Oh, but you will.
First I will do things
to your girl
that you have never
even dreamt of doing.
Then I will hurt her, badly,
all while you watch.
And if that
is not good enough,
then I will begin
torturing you,
and if anyone
who knows torture,
it is we Nazis.
Our doctors have devised
such unimaginable techniques
used in the death camps
of Auschwitz and Dachau.
Yeah, how to torture
innocent civilians.
Oh, we torture soldiers, too.
In our prisoner-of-war camps
we torture many
of Allied soldiers,
men who served their country
more nobly than you,
men of true value
and integrity,
strong specimens,
not worthless cripples
like you!
She's gone.
She took the puppets with her.
Except for Ninja, Blade,
and Pinhead.
If it's war that Jap wants,
we'll give it to her.
