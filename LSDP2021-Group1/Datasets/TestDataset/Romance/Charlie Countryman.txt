Hi, Bill.
I knocked. You know,
there's no answer.
I thought, you know,
you drowned or something.
Sorry, I...
I didn't drown.
I'm just having a bath.
Charlie, it's time.
Your morn, she--
They called?
Yeah.
It's Sambuca.
Put this
in your pocket.
We switched
to a manual apparatus
which enables us
to ease her out.
Mr. Green, I honestly think you're
doing the right thing here.
Can I have
one of those?
They're
for my back.
Can we say for now that
my back hurts too, Bill?
Two is the ticket if it
hurts as much as mine does.
This is what happens.
Are you ready?
Took a powder,
eh, Charlie?
I'm sorry, it's just that-that
I feel horrible now.
I blame myself, Charlie. I
was never very good at it.
At what?
Being a mom.
No, mom. That's not true. You were good.
You were great.
Weren't you?
I was always so wrapped
up in my own crap.
Meeting Greg and
leaving your dad.
And meeting Bill
and leaving Greg.
I could never
get the sequences right.
You are
a complicated lady.
I didn't mean to be.
Were. I know,
I know.
And I sure didn't mean for you to
be running out on death scenes.
And just floating through your
entire existence, Charlie.
I'm the one
who's sorry, kiddo.
What do I do now? I still got a
whole life to go now, you know?
Did we not just say that
was never my thing?
Please, Mom. I need you
to be specific now.
Just this once.
Tell me what to do.
I got it.
Go to Bucharest.
Bucharest?
Yeah.
Go to Bucharest.
Why, Mom?
I don't know.
It seems specific.
Just do it,
Charlie.
Say you promise.
I promise.
Good.
I have to go now,
Charlie.
Mom, wait a second,
I got this--
I have this horrible
visual in my head of you.
I need something nicer,
something fun...
Oh, Charlie...
oh, you goof.
Come here.
God.
Charles?
It's okay.
Just give us a minute.
We're not together
anymore. Go home.
Oh, no. Ted.
Oh, my God. Ted.
Yeah, you're not funny.
Go home. Yeah.
Yo, Ashley,
everything cool?
It's fine,
just give us a minute.
What are you gonna do,
Chuck Norris?
Go fuck yourself.
Asshole.
I'm moving
to Bucharest.
Yeah? Are you sure you're
not thinking of Budapest?
It's supposed to be
really nice there.
My mother
just died so...
You Okay?
Yeah.
Just take care
of yourself, Charles.
Sir.
What do you mean
with touching me?
I didn't. You fell asleep
on my shoulder, sir. Sorry.
What is wrong
with your face?
What's that?
Your eyes. Here.
You look bad.
My mother just died.
I'm sorry for you.
My wife died
many years time ago.
I never loved
another woman since.
Well, I'm sorry
for you also.
I make sex with many of them,
sure, but never with love. Yeah.
I am Victor Ibanescu.
Charlie Countryman. Nice to meet you.
Romanian.
American.
Charlie...
Yeah?
Why are you going
to Bucharest? Tell me.
I don't really know,
to be honest with you.
You didn't want
to go to Budapest?
No, I was just kinda...
Yeah, Bucharest. Just spur of the
moment kind of thing, you know?
I understand
this kind of thing.
I see, you don't
want to speak with me.
No, I just--
No trouble for me. No.
I didn't know if you wanted to keep
speaking or if you wanted your own time.
I speak with you first and you're
not sure I want to speak with you?
Strange way of a mind
to be working, no?
Yeah, I'm sorry. That's sort
of why I'm going on this trip.
Work things out
in my mind.
Yes, yes.
Bafta acolo, Charlie.
Good luck in there!
Thank you.
Bafta acolo.
If you don't mind me
asking, how do you wind
up in Chicago when
you're from Romania?
Me?
Yeah.
I want to see the Cubbies
at Wrigley's Field.
Cubbies.
I want to sing Take Me Out to The
Ballgame one time before I die.
And one, and two, and three strikes and
you are an out for the old ballgame.
Wow.
Why the Cubs, though? I mean,
there's other better teams.
The Cubs are pretty--
It's a shitty team.
Yes! The Cubbies will never win
the Worlds Championship Series.
Of course not. Never,
never, never. No.
But Romania, my country, there's
many problems in history, too.
Invasions, occupations,
dictators.
It is problems
which make us who were are...
which give us character.
Same as the Cubbies!
Yes. Yes!
You make a lot
of sense, Victor.
My pleasure.
Yeah, my pleasure.
My pleasure.
Yeah.
May I show you something very,
very, very incredible?
Yeah, of course!
For my daughter.
Oh, my God.
Wow.
You think she
will love it?
Yeah, well,
who wouldn't?
Yeah? Who wouldn't? This is what
I thought. Who wouldn't?
Hello?
Please, champagne, for
my friend and me.
And perhaps you'll bring another
glass for yourself too, my darling?
Look, it's nice this hat.
It's very nice.
Yeah, that's
really nice.
Buddy?
Victor?
Victor, Victor, Victor?
Oh, fuck!
Oh, boy!
Can I help you, sir? ls
there a doctor here?
You should just take
his pulse.
I don't know what
I'm supposed to do here.
What do we do?
What do we do with a
dead man on the plane?
Just be quiet. You're going
to alarm the others, okay?
He's a dead man so I
need to move seats now.
I'll be back
in a second, okay?
Excuse me!
Excuse me!
Excuse me!
No, I can't-- I can't sit.
I'm terribly sorry, sir
but you have no choice but
to continue on to Bucharest.
You can't even move seats, I'm afraid,
because it's totally fully booked.
This is
a dead man.
Look, why don't you just enjoy
your complimentary beverage, okay?
Listen. Listen, I can't sit here!
Put me in a jump seat!
Put me in the bathroom! In the lavatory!
We will keep them coming, all right.
Just put me in the lavatory.
And I need--
I suggest you
calm down, sir.
My hands! Listen! I need a wet nap!
Can you get me...
Charlie.
Charlie?
Yes?
Come into here.
Okay.
Charlie...
Yes?
I saw your mother.
Yes?
I told her you are going
to Bucharest.
She smiles for you.
I'm sorry
you're dead, Victor.
Oh, nevermind!
I see also my wife.
She made some love
with me.
And Charlie, I ask
you a special thing.
Yes?
It is my daughter.
Perhaps you'll give her my gift?
Yes.
And please,
tell her she is...
"fetita mea cu
picioare de catel."
Say again?
I don't speak...
What'd you say?
He wants to know if the funny
hat is belonging to you.
Belonging to me?
Yes. My funny hat.
No, this is my hat,
my friend!
What'd you say to him?
I told him it's not
your funny hat, man.
Why? Because it's
not your funny hat.
So, you're an asshole? How do
you say asshole in Romanian?
To an American, I say
you're an asshole.
Sir, this hat belonged to a
friend of mine. He was--
Okay.
Charlie Countryman.
That's you.
Hi. I'm Radu.
Radu?
Or Mr. Radu?
No, I'm the one who's asking the
questions today, my friend.
Victor Ibanescu.
You knew this guy?
I met him on the plane.
You know, very, very brief.
Can you tell me why does a guy
want a guy he doesn't know
to take a hat
to his daughter?
Why can't the guy
take the hat
to his daughter
by himself?
I'm sorry.
It's a lot for me
to process because
I just got tazed.
Is this something you guys normally do?
You just tase--
Charlie, questions me.
Answers you.
Yes. Okay.
Nice and slow.
Do you think Victor Ibanescu
knew he was going to die?
Or perhaps, he said it to
you after he was dead.
Maybe you talk
to the dead people?
Like that boy in the
Bruce Willis film?
I talk to dead people.
I think he sees
the dead people.
What?
You do drugs,
Charlie?
No! No.
Hi. I'm Charlie
Countryman.
Eu sint
Gabriela Ibanescu.
Can you tell me what
happened with my father?
He fell asleep and uh--
that was it.
He just didn't wake up.
On me, actually.
He was...
If you still look here,
his drool is right here.
Your father wanted me
to tell you something.
I don't understand how could
he know we would meet?
Well, he said something
about you to me.
If you want
to hear it.
Please.
He said that you
were his f-f fatate
Fuck.
Fetita catel picante
fetita mea cu picioare de catel.
Yes.
Yes.
He said that? Really?
What does that mean?
She has feet of a
childish dog woman.
Puppy feet girl.
Would you allow me?
Anything. Yes.
Thank you.
You could have this shirt
if you want to.
You could
just take it.
I mean, I have
other shirts in my bag.
Here.
Thank you, Charlie.
You're welcome, Gabi.
It's nice
to meet you.
Robert Redford!
What's that?
Robert Redford!
Me Robert Redford?
No, you Robert Redford, man!
No, no, no, no.
Hubble Gardner!
Yeah?
I don't speak...
Pull over.
Stop the car! Stop...
Ca bit
No, keep it.
It was a gift.
I meant to follow
the ambulance, but
it was driving like some kind
of idiot and I lost him.
Look, there's a bunch of traffic. I bet
we can still catch it if we go now?
We?
We, yes, yes.
Listen, I know you
don't know me, okay?
I have a feeling about this. And
I don't get a lot of feelings.
Not clear ones anyway,
so when I do get
a feeling like this one,
I try to trust it.
I'm super nervous right now 'cause
this is a wild experience for me.
Scoot over.
Scoot over. What?
Hubble!
Your cab.
Sorry, my friend.
How much?
Three? Three. Yes?
Yes.
There's second out,
third, fourth. Yeah?
Yep.
You play cello?
What gives you
this idea?
There's a cello
in your trunk.
Maybe you have some kind of
fantasy about helping a sad woman
in a far away land happens
to play the cello?
I am making a joke.
You're making a joke?
You did not understand?
No, I just didn't hear 'cause
a tram just went by right
when you were saying probably
saying the punch line!
You have punch
lines here, yes?
The joke is to imply that you are
making this up in your mind.
Right.
'Cause I am pretty, I'm
vulnerable, I play the cello.
It's a boy's dream, no?
Well, you're pretty enough,
you know,
But I'm more
of a tuba guy myself.
I play the cello in the orchestra
of the Bucharest Opera House.
Really?
My father was
my teacher.
For my darling Gabi.
Love, Nigel.
Oh, come on!
Thank you!
Thank you!
Excuse me!
North Golescu?
Excuse me.
Opera house?
You don't know? That way?
Hey!
Excuse me!
Excuse me!
Hi, I'm looking
for Gabriela Iban--
Sorry. Sorry!
Sorry!
Hi, Gabi's phone.
Gabi. Hi! How are you?
Where are you.
I came to the Opera. I didn't
know where else to go,
so I just came here.
I have your car and your
cello and everything.
I want you
to wait for me, okay?
Okay. Really like a nice place to work.
Like, incredible.
Think I'm about
to audition.
Do you see a man who looks
like his face is in pain?
Face is in pain?
Yes.
He yelled at me.
Can you give
him the phone?
Give him the phone?
Okay.
Tempo! Tempo!
Just a second.
Hi. Hi. Gabi.
Gabi?
Gabi.
Sorry.
Wait
at the door.
Which door?
Because there's also--
Wait at the
fucking door!
I can carry this,
if you want.
Do you want me
to carry it? Sorry.
Follow me.
Okay.
Wait here.
Hello, gorgeous.
What are you doing
here, Nigel?
Partaking of the arts.
Care of the soul.
Listen, I happened
to hear about Old Victor's
spectacular
and horrible passing.
I came back
to pay my respects.
How could you have heard?
It only just happened.
Now you know me.
Always an ear to the ground
when it comes
to the disposition
of my darling Gabi.
Who's this then?
Who are you?
I'm Nigel.
Who the fuck are you?
Charlie.
Who the fuck is
Charlie, Gabi?
Charlie is an
American tuba player.
Here to observe
the company.
He's homosexual.
Is he now?
Must make you quite the star
cocksucker around here, Charlie?
Nigel, what do you want?
Charlie, you should leave.
Charlie, you should
stay. Definitely.
As you know, darling, Victor and I had
some unfinished business between us.
What are you
talking about?
My father hated you.
How do you guys
know each other?
Sorry.
Nigel was
my husband.
I beg your pardon, Gabi.
Did you say was?
Honestly?
Fucking was?
Gabi...
No, Charlie, not fucking was.
Fucking is.
Fucking meaning I currently fucking
am 'til death do us fucking part.
If it isn't the shrieking cunt himself.
Hello, Bela.
You will go immediately
or I will call the police!
Go!
Gabi, darling, we do need to
have a catch-up rather soon.
Say, sometime in
the next 24 hours?
Bela, nice meeting
you again.
Charlie, I'll
catch you later.
You should go.
Where's a good place
for me to go, you think?
Marco Polo Youth Hostel.
It is nearby. Any taxi
driver will know it.
Okay. And I just say Marco Polo,
like if I was in the States?
What the fuck.
This is it?
Thank you.
Marco Polo, yeah?
Yeah.
Marco Polo?
This way?
Polo.
Polo!
Which way?
My friend, my friend,
my friend. Marco Polo, yeah?
What?
This the Marco Polo
Youth Hostel? Sorry.
Yes, my friend!
Come on in!
What's your name?
Charlie.
Charlie, everybody.
Hi Charlie!
What can I give you?
Just a room.
No passports
in my kingdom, baby.
No bags?
No.
I have the perfect room for
you, Mr. No Bags! Thirty-four.
Do you want
some gum, Charlie?
Yeah, sure.
Okay. Take it.
Thank you.
Top floor. Enjoy.
Hi.
Where the fuck have
you been, man?
You were supposed
to be here, like, yesterday!
They said 34 downstairs?
Come in, come in!
Thank you.
I'm Luke.
This is Carl.
That's your bed there.
Just make yourself at home.
My name's Charlie.
Charlie.
Nice to meet you.
Don't worry about him too much,
Charlie. He's on a program.
Really?
Carl, tell Charlie
about your program.
Please, Luke,
don't take the piss.
Listen to that, he's just a
little bit shy at first.
But trust me, that
onion is worth peeling.
He's a crazy motherfucker!
He's a party animal!
You're gonna love him, I promise.
Come in, come in!
Do you want some crisps? They'll
make your bullocks tingle.
Yeah, sure.
Yeah, take a seat.
So, you guys been
here for a while or...?
I've been here...
let me think...
Week? Few weeks?
Couple of months?
I don't know.
It's been a bit of a blur,
I got to be honest, Charlie.
Been here six days,
Charlie.
Oh, you're not together?
You know, like traveling
together, I meant.
Relax, okay? Look, he's not
my type, with him being ginger.
Not having a pussy.
You get what I mean?
Right, right, right.
Yes. Today.
Yeah? Where you come from?
Chicago.
Chicago?
Hey, Chi-ca-go!
That's my kind of town.
Is it?
Yeah, well,
I've never been.
You like ecstasy,
Charlie?
In answer to your silent question,
Charlie, this is why I love this guy.
Yes.
We should go and get a few beers
or something. You up for that?
Beer? Yeah.
Yeah?
Great. Well, first round's on you.
Come, let's go!
Three beers for
the three queers.
Thank you, sir.
Did Carl tell you? He's auditioning
to become a porn star.
Porn star?
I have no aspirations to star.
I simply want to act.
That is funny.
Tell him what your nom de
porn is going to be.
Boris Pecker.
Can you fucking--
There is no other name?
Boris!
Boris Pecker.
I feel fucking weird
right now, man.
Charlie, Charlie. I feel
fucked right now, man.
How's your beer,
how's your beer?
I just feel fucked
right now. I mean...
Can I tell you my story?
Yeah.
So, this guy Victor, he died on my
fucking plane right next to me.
And he gives me a hat, and
it's a gift for his daughter.
Her name's Gabi. Gabriela.
Right.
And she plays the cello.
Cello!
When you hear her talk,
your fucking heart stops.
Fucking amazing. This
beer's weird as shit, but--
Having a good time?
'Cause it looks like
you're having a
motherfucking good time.
Amazing. I felt
like I love her.
I do, I do, I do!
I feel like I love her.
I have to make you aware,
Charlie.
Luke put Carpathian
ecstasy in your beer.
You did? Who did?
Yeah, yeah!
I did. Come on,
listen...
Well, fuck, man!
No, no, no,
no, no, no!
No, no,
it's fine, though!
It's fine. Mine
and Carl's are laced too.
We all have fucking
trolley's at the moment.
We're all in a zone
of mutuality.
We're all together,
rising sun.
Listen, your experience
is your own, yeah?
But we vote on shared
hallucinations, okay?
Any hallucinations in the zone
of mutuality must be voted on.
Who here among us would like all the women
to be naked or semi-naked right now?
All right.
There is. Oh, my God.
Having a good time?
These women are naked.
This is my gift to you.
Merry Christmas.
Oh, my Go oh, my God!
Are you in the zone
of individuality also?
Sure.
Sure. Why not?
Okay.
Listen, I'm glad we bumped
into each other like this.
I want to apologize
for my behavior.
Charlie. The fucking love,
Charlie. The fucking love.
Yeah, sure.
Turns me somewhat insane, if
I'm being honest with you.
Can I tell you that?
Be honest with me.
Regardless,
I do apologize.
But I didn't
wash my hands.
What's a little piss
among friends?
Oh, Charlie.
Enjoy your new mates
and your recreational drugs
and the rest of it
while you can.
God knows it can all turn into
blood in a blink of an eye.
Yes.
Your bag was
in my car, Charlie.
I left it at the
hostel for you, okay?
You're married?
What's up with that?
Walking with me? It
could get you killed.
Charlie! I'll just walk
across the street.
I'll walk right
here in the street.
I'm going to help you. It's good.
What are doing?
You want to share
a cavalla?
Maybe on our
second date.
It's my mother's
favorite song.
This was my father's
favorite restaurant.
I used to play cello right
here when I was young.
My father hated that he put me
in the place where I met Nigel.
He once ran through here cursing and
throwing candles at the curtains.
It didn't work.
He was very drunk.
Good place to be drunk.
Good sober food. I mean,
these are great doughnuts.
The best.
Gabi, can I
say something?
I understand.
When you lose
someone who's
your home, you know, you're
only home in the world.
And when that happens,
you think,
"Oh, fuck, I should
have had a back-up home."
Another person, a place,
a thing, something
to make me feel safe,
and I don't have that.
And now I'm lost.
I am not lost.
I am angry.
That's why
I'm scared for you.
You know, for that
picture in your head.
Close your eyes.
Get rid of that one.
That one's gone.
That's gone.
Blank slate.
Pick a good one, a really good one.
One that's so good
it'll keep
the bad one unstuck.
See?
Thank you,
Charlie.
What are you doing?
I'm going to show you
all these that I know.
I know all
these positions.
This is the motherfucker
right here.
This is
the one I know.
I'm not going to laugh.
Fucking, balance!
That's a fucker.
That's a motherfucker.
Time for goodbye,
Charlie.
No! We should
go walk some more.
Let's do it again. Let's just
do the whole path again.
It's a full moon! We get
bikes, we go ride around.
We can do anything.
We'll get pancakes.
No, I am sorry.
Why?
It's like they say, another
time, another place. Right?
Who's they? You got friends
that tell you what to do?
Fuck them, fuck they,
fuck all that.
'Cause this is,
this is important.
This. This, all this.
This is--
This is big to us.
To us?
Us. Two letters,
whole world.
Whole world like an oyster that you can
put the future and the past into, right?
And the middle is this
"us" thing.
Which is a pearl,
which is us.
Goodbye, Charlie.
Stay. Okay?
Yeah.
Charlie, please!
Yeah. I can't do that. I don't
know how to do that. I'm sorry.
Remember, Charlie, it can all turn
to blood in a blink of an eye.
Hey, man.
Did you see a man here?
A man standing here?
Okay. Okay.
Watch it, watch it,
watch it.
What the fuck,
man? Please!
You need help, man.
You're all bloody.
Yeah, I got hit
by a car, Luke.
You need to see this.
Carl! Come out! Charlie's back!
Show him what you've done!
Can't I just see it in the morning?
No, you've got to see this now.
Stop being a baby and just
get out here, will you?
He's a bit embarrassed. so just be cool
and don't make a big deal out of this.
He doesn't want
to come out.
Come on, come on!
It's fine, it's fine!
Holy shit.
Goes for his job interview,
comes back looking like that!
I don't feel well,
Charlie.
One Viagra, I told him
to take. Two tops.
Tell Charlie how many
Viagra you took.
Five.
Six.
These are Romanian Viagra.
Carl, why don't you
sit down, man?
Let's go to a titty bar.
It's my only hope.
Take him to a hospital, Luke.
I'm not going out with you to a titty bar.
You've got to come with us.
Carl needs you.
He's in crisis!
I just got hit by a car, right?
Take a couple of codeine.
You'll be fine, all right?
They let you
travel with this?
If I can't travel freely
with my drum of drugs,
then the terrorists have won.
Five minutes, Charlie.
There we go. There we go.
Don't let it touch me though.
There we go. Come on. Easy.
Easy out the door.
Romanian?
Yeah, my grandparents
are Romanian.
How do you say
I love you?
I like to send
a single wildflower.
No, no, no. You got to say
that from the heart, Charlie.
You can't fuck around with that shit.
No, how do I say I love you in Romanian?
Oh, it's easy!
It's easy.
Te iubesc. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Te iubesc?
So if I'm saying
it to a girl, I say
"Te iubesc, Gabi"
or "Gabi, Te iubesc." or--
Te iubesc, Gabi.
She'll love it.
After that?
I can make you happy.
No, thank you.
It's impossible.
It's like Sophie's Choice!
You guys have got
to help me.
Come on, guys!
We can have a good time
without objectifying
these women, surely!
Luke, it's a titty bar!
Look! She's perfect.
Yeah.
Come on, let's get you a drink.
What do you want?
Beer.
Hey, hello!
Hi.
Excuse me, madam.
I've got
a medical situation.
Please let me introduces ourselves.
I'm John, this is Kevin.
We're here on business, you see.
We're looking at the club.
We think we might buy it! How
are your talking skills?
We definitely could do with a
couple of admin girls in the--
in the Romanian district
of our office.
No.
Look over there. See?
What's wrong?
I came in my pants.
All right!
Hi, I'm Darko.
Darko? Really?
Really.
There's a problem?
We have this bill here.
It seems pretty extravagant.
Me and my friends had a couple of beers.
He got a lap dance
and it says 9,900 lei.
Which is...
It's crazy.
I see this is correct due to
your friend shooting his load.
His load?
Are you serious?
How do I look to you currently?
Serious or unserious?
Yeah, serious.
Excuse me, Dorko.
My name is Darko.
Darko.
And maybe if I put this pen
right into your asshole
then write my name inside,
you will remember?
Something is funny?
Yeah. What you just said with
the pen-in-the-asshole thing.
I mean you can't actually write
inside someone's asshole.
It wouldn't actually
help me remember.
How can you read inside
your own asshole?
You wouldn't be
able to read it.
A guy's who's head is cut off
and then stuck up inside.
If you cut his head off, he's not
going to be able to read anything,
because he'll be dead and you're
not going to do that, are you?
Come here.
What?
Darko, we're all
staying at a youth hostel
and they've been there for some
time, they've made some friends.
So they would obviously, they would
notice if we didn't show up.
And so if we can just--
So if we were to come up
with a dollar figure--
Is this photo making
you stop talking a lot?
Do you know the man
who I am with?
Because how you look
now is people
who know this man look
like when they see him.
Or is it the girl
that you know?
Listen, boy.
Listen.
In my mind, this man
is not in Bucharest
but it would be good for me to know if
my mind is wrong and he is in Bucharest.
Would it help our situation
with you if I did know?
Stay within yourself now
and try to breathe.
Okay.
Now tell me, what do you
know about this man?
I'm going to have to call you with
that information after we leave here.
I really like your guts.
I really do.
Come here.
I will look into
this question by myself.
However, if I don't hear from
you tonight, latest tomorrow
your boyhood faces will be made into
pork rind to be eaten by my dogs.
And try to realize,
my friend...
no matter where
you go now...
this is how close
I'm going to be to you.
Here. Take it.
What the fuck was all that
shit back there, Charlie?
Are you in some Three Days of
the Condor shit or something?
No. It's Three Days of Condor...
It's nothing.
I'll see you
guys later, yeah?
Yeah, all right.
What's his problem?
Well, he's just found out
that the girl that he loves
could possibly be a skank
stripper, mate.
Genuine ho bag.
Hey!
You cannot sleep
here, sir.
Hey!
Bela!
Oh, hey!
Good morning.
Listen, I'm looking--
It's evening, idiot.
Is it evening? It is
evening, it's evening.
You must leave Gabriela be.
She grieves for her father.
She has suffered enough at the
hands of rogues such as yourself.
Rogues open doors,
Bela?
Bela, do rogues
open doors? Please.
Get in.
I said if you find me,
I would kiss you.
Are you drunk?
What is it?
Charlie, tell me.
I met Darko
at his club.
Let's just talk about it another time.
I'm sorry I brought it up.
Darko?
Fucking Darko?
Charlie, do you have any idea
what kind of a man he is?
Yes, of course. Yeah, I
have a very clear idea.
What happened?
You tell me now.
There was an incident and my
friend had an erection, and so--
And they took you
to the office.
They took me
to the office.
I played it cool.
You played it cool?
Fuck yeah.
I'm sorry. I find
that hard to believe.
Well, I did.
You, sir.
You cannot be here!
Charlie? You seen
Gabi of late?
She's not here,
is she?
No.
Listen, I meant
to ask you this before.
Okay, how can
I put this?
Can you do that Dizzy Gillespie
thing with your cheeks?
You know, where he goes
all puffy-fish like?
Being the champion tubaist-cocksucker
you are reputed to be?
He was a trumpet player.
Come on, Charlie.
Go on.
What?
If that's not the most woeful bit
of puffy-fishery I ever did see.
You know, it occurs to me, Charlie,
that maybe you're not a tubaist.
Maybe you're not even
an actual faggot.
Maybe the truth of it is that
you've got designs on my wife.
What do you think, Gabi?
You were meant
to ring me, darling.
You need to leave,
Nigel.
Now.
the brain of a man,
the aim of Annie Oakley?
Ever the total
package, my Gabi is.
Let's say I give you 'til
tomorrow to seek me out
but that's the best I can do.
Agreed?
Guess I'm off then,
Charlie.
But we'll get a funny
face out of you yet, right?
Bela knows something?
Bela will always
know something.
He's telling me that it was my
father who made Nigel leave. How?
There is some kind of tape
of Nigel doing something
and my father used it to
make Nigel leave Bucharest.
This is
the unfinished business.
With my father gone, Nigel and
Darko want to find the tape.
How does this happen? How do
you meet a man like this? How?
When I was a little girl,
my life was music.
And my father tried to
introduce me to other things,
but there was
nothing else for me.
To me it made no
difference where I was
What I did not know
was that above the café,
there was a small flat.
Ana' he listen to my playing as
he struggled with his injuries.
And every day he would
became stronger.
He said my playing
saved his life.
the mast beautiful
man I had ever seen
It's like some kind
of wounded animal.
And I had no idea
who he was or what he did.
All I knew was that he said
my playing saved his life.
You know, things I otherwise
would not have learned.
Over time,
I learned what he was.
I loved him.
What is this?
There was minimal
violence and sex.
Too much love.
Nigel was the wrong
person for me.
And wrong is wrong.
What about Darko?
What about Darko?
I saw a picture
of you at his club.
You were in your work outfit
or some other fancy--
So you live here, yeah?
I thought this was
Victor's house, right?
My father wanted me home
after Nigel left.
Thank you.
I was happy to do it.
Welcome to Bucharest,
Charlie.
Wow.
It's like...
a Romanian grain alcohol,
like a rice wine?
Shut up and drink.
You're nervous. That's why
we're drinking this shit.
Drink.
I'm nervous.
So you think
I danced for Darko?
Or maybe I was a whore.
I'm sorry
I brought it up.
I really don't care.
It doesn't matter.
I was a bartender,
Charlie.
My job was to give
drinks to people.
I'm sorry
I brought it up.
Forget I said anything.
I don't care.
You think you love me?
Yes.
Do you think things like
this happen to people?
Some people, yes.
What people?
Us.
Us.
I remember all the things
you said to me.
Every word.
My mother died.
Before I left,
she died.
You did not tell me.
You've had a lot
on your plate.
Finally we have
something in common.
What brings you here,
Charlie?
You look a little bit pink, Charlie-boy.
ls everything all right?
Nothing amiss,
is it?
I thought you were
coming back.
What? What?
You thought what?
That a runty cunt such as you
are ever stood a chance?
Come on, son. This is reality
when you don't fucking register.
I register fine,
you greasy fuck!
What's this now?
Suddenly found the hard man within
our self, Charlie, haven't we?
Charlie, get out of here!
The clock's ticking on my benevolence.
I saw the tape.
What tape, Charlie?
You know what tape.
Gabi, darling...
you just finished telling me you
had no idea about any of this.
Because I have no fucking idea
what Charlie is talking about.
Nigel!
Where is it, Charlie?
Where's what?
The tape!
Surely, this is not what
you left home to find?
Your head in a plastic bag, choking
on your own fucking blood!
I'm in charge,
not you, fucker!
Nigel. stop!
Charlie's in charge!
Charlie has the tape.
I got you, Charlie. The only
explanation for the behavior
that you're exhibiting
is that-- Are you in love?
Are you in love,
Charlie?
That's between me
and your wife.
Gabi, Charlie's in love.
Any idea who with?
But something tells me his name
is not Kevin or Phillip
or fucking Andre.
It's a she, fucker.
Okay. Let's put a pin in the fucking
love story for now, shall we?
I'd like to get back to my
primary agenda item.
Where's the tape?
Her name's Gabi.
No! Stop! Nigel, I told you,
he means nothing to me, okay?
That was mean!
We don't believe you!
Nigel, he's
not important!
Last chance for petrol, boy.
The tape?
I'm in charge.
I'm in charge.
Welcome to limbo,
Charlie.
Don't get too comfortable. It's
not your final destination.
I'll be along soon enough
to hasten you there.
What the fuck?
He's up there!
Let me go.
We didn't do anything!
Hey.
It's time to go.
You know, sir. Gabi doesn't
want to see you again.
She didn't say
that to you.
I choose Budapest for you.
A very nice place.
Safe and pretty.
I'm not going to Budapest.
No, Bela!
You are going there, okay?
Bela! Hey!
Bela, Bela, Bela! Hey!
Here we go, baby.
What do you mean, here we go, baby.
Where are we going?
Bags and Budapest.
I'm not going
to Budapest.
Good boy, aren't we?
Okay.
Sorry?
Go get your bags!
Get my stuff?
Okay.
What?
What's wrong?
Evil guys are
in the house.
They left this for you.
Who?
Oh, fuck.
I think you
should run away.
Yeah, run,
run, run! Run away!
Oh, fuck!
Thank you.
Whoa!
Gabi!
Long time no see,
right?
I think it's a good idea if you tell
me now everything that you know.
Have a peek.
Oh, God!
See there's no ropes and tape
or anything? You know why?
Because I used the super
crazy glue on them.
If they move, rip!
Off goes the skin.
Nice, right?
What the fuck
do you want to know?
The fucking tape?
I don't have the tape!
The tape was here, the tape is gone!
That's all I know.
Hello?
Gabriela.
Give me the phone.
You sit your
ass down.
I'm here with
this Charlie guy.
Let me ask him. Are you
all right, Charlie?
I'm fine.
He's okay for now.
But we need to speak
about this tape.
I hope this is
why you're calling me.
Sure. Sure.
I like this plan.
Hug. hug.
Bye, bye.
What's happening?
Where is she?
Charlie.
I'd love to sit down with
you and explain it all
like in a fucking
James Bond movie
but I get bored
so fast.
And I have
things to do.
You look
so fucked up.
Does this hurt?
Gabi, oh, fuck.
The tape? The tape.
I went to the apartment to get
the tape and it wasn't there.
I'm sorry. Forget about
the tape, Charlie.
What?
Forget about all of it.
This is the last time you will see me.
Do you understand?
No. No, I fucking
don't understand.
Gabi, it's us.
There is no us.
It's us, right?
No.
None of this happened until you
came along talking about us.
Your mommy dies and you think
you can go on a big adventure
to feel something different than
what you're supposed to feel!
No! Gabi,
Gabi, Gabi.
I know you're confused. I'm
fucking confused also.
Hey! I'm confused also.
But it's us.
It's the pearl, right?
The rest is oyster.
I belong with Nigel.
You said it was wrong.
You said it was wrong!
Wrong is wrong!
I was out of my head
over my father.
No, we are right, us!
It was real!
You did not think
I could go
from loving
someone like Nigel
to loving someone
like you.
Go away!
Go away, little boy.
Are you sure
Darko understood?
We meet,
we destroy the tape.
Life goes on.
Did you want
some more advice?
No advice. I'm good.
You were a great mom.
Solid B-plus.
B-plus?
You bring me all this
friggin' way for a B-plus?
I'm joking with you,
Mom. You were an A.
You are an A.
You know what's funny?
When I told you to go to
Bucharest, I meant Budapest.
I got them
all mixed up.
It's classic me,
right?
It is you.
I'm so proud
of you, Charlie.
I can see you've come exactly
as far as you needed to go.
Not quite.
I hope you don't
die, kiddo.
Yeah, well, if I do,
I die for love.
Pretty fucking
cool way to go.
Charlie!
You said everything I said
was in your heart. What?
Everything, I know
that means something.
Do you have your gun?
Where's the gun?
I don't know! I don't
have it here handy!
Wish me luck.
Oh, no, no, no!
Charlie!
Gabi, Gabi!
Is it true what
they say, Charlie?
Better to have loved
and lost and all that?
Oh, please...
You think you love me?
Yes.
Gabi, Gabi...
Well...
Shot poor Charlie for
love did you, gorgeous?
Christ!
