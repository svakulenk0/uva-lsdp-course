BORIS: That's not
what I'm saying,
you imbecile.
God, you completely
misrepresent my ideas!
Why am I even bothering
talking to such idiots?
Boris, calm down.
No, don't tell me to...
I am calm.
Don't jump on us
just because
we don't understand
what you're saying.
I didn't jump on you.
It's not the idea
behind Christianity
I'm faulting,
or Judaism,
or any religion.
It's the professionals
who've made it into
a corporate business.
There's big money
in the God racket.
Big money.
Here we go.
- We know, Boris.
Hey, the basic
teachings of Jesus
are quite wonderful.
So, by the way,
is the original intention
of Karl Marx. Okay?
Oh.
Hey, what could be bad?
Everybody should
share equally.
Do unto others. Democracy.
Government by the people.
All great ideas.
These are all great ideas,
but they all suffer
from one fatal flaw.
Which is?
Yeah, what's that?
Which is they're
all based on the
fallacious notion
that people are
fundamentally decent.
Give them
a chance to do right
and they'll take it.
They're not stupid,
selfish, greedy,
cowardly,
short-sighted worms.
They do the best
they can.
Speak for yourself, man.
Speak for yourself.
All I'm saying is
that people make life
so much worse
than it has to be
and, believe me,
it's a nightmare
without their help.
But on the whole,
I'm sorry to say,
we're a failed species.
I wouldn't go
that far.
Not Ed.
That's why this
woman you like, Joe,
so what if she's
an embalmer's assistant,
so she stinks
from formaldehyde?
For Christ's sake,
you got to take
what little pleasure
you can find in
this chamber of horrors.
A little
formaldehyde, okay,
but she reeks of it.
You know, they don't
know your story.
Boris, tell them
your story.
My story is,
whatever works.
You know, as long as
you don't hurt anybody.
Any way you can
filch a little joy
in this cruel,
dog-eat-dog,
pointless, black chaos.
That's my story.
No. That's not...
Tell them the story.
Tell them.
Yeah. Tell them.
You just want me
to say it again,
so they can hear.
Who?
- Them.
Who?
- Who's them?
JOE: You see something out there?
- Where?
What are you?
An imbecile?
There's an audience
full of people
looking at us.
An audience?
- What's he talking about?
You feel you're
being watched.
They paid good
money for tickets,
hard-earned money,
so some moron
in Hollywood can buy
a bigger swimming pool.
Okay, you're saying
there are human beings
out there
who bought tickets
to watch us.
Well, mostly they're
interested in me,
I have to say.
Yeah, they're
just sitting there.
Don't you see them?
Some are eating popcorn,
some are just
staring straight ahead
breathing
through their mouths
like Neanderthals.
So they're there
to listen to your story?
Total delusions of grandeur.
Completely.
Why would you want
to hear my story?
Do we know each other?
Do we like each other?
Let me tell you
right off, okay?
I'm not a likeable guy.
Charm has never been
a priority with me.
And just so you know,
this is not the feel-good
movie of the year.
So if you're one
of those idiots
who needs to feel good,
go get yourself
a foot massage.
Mom, that man's
talking to himself!
Come away, Justin.
What the hell does
it all mean anyhow?
Nothing. Zero. Zilch.
Nothing comes
to anything,
and yet
there's no shortage
of idiots to babble.
Not me. I have a vision.
I'm discussing you.
Your friends,
your co-workers,
your newspapers, the TV.
Everybody's happy to talk,
full of misinformation.
Morality, science,
religion, politics,
sports, love.
Your portfolio,
your children, health.
Christ. If I have to
eat nine servings
of fruits and vegetables
a day to live,
I don't want to live.
I hate goddamn
fruits and vegetables.
And your omega-3's
and the treadmill
and the cardiogram
and the mammogram
and the pelvic sonogram
and, oh, my God,
the colonoscopy!
And with it all,
the day still comes
when they put you in a box
and it's on to the next
generation of idiots
who'll also tell
you all about life
and define for you
what's appropriate.
My father
committed suicide
because the morning newspapers
depressed him.
And could you blame him?
With the horror and corruption
and ignorance and poverty
and genocide and AIDS
and global warming
and terrorism
and the family-value morons
and the gun morons!
"The horror,"
Kurtz said at the end
of
"The horror."
Lucky Kurtz didn't have the
delivered in the jungle,
then he'd see
some horror.
But what do you do?
You read about some
massacre in Darfur
or some school bus
gets blown up,
and you go,
"Oh, my God, the horror!"
And then you
turn the page
and finish your eggs
from free-range chickens.
Because what can you do?
It's overwhelming.
I tried to commit
suicide myself.
Obviously,
it didn't work out.
But why do you even
want to hear about
all this?
Christ, you got
your own problems.
I'm sure you're
all obsessed with
any number of sad
little hopes and dreams.
Your predictably
unsatisfying love lives.
Your failed
business ventures.
"Oh, if only I'd
bought that stock!"
"If only I had purchased
that house years ago!"
"If only I had made
a move on that woman."
If this, if that.
You know what?
Give me a break
with your "could haves"
and "should haves."
Like my mother
used to say,
"If my grandmother had wheels,
she'd be a trolley car."
My mother didn't have wheels.
She had varicose veins.
Still, the woman gave birth
to a brilliant mind.
I was considered for
a Nobel Prize in physics.
I didn't get it.
But, you know,
it's all politics,
just like every
other phony honor.
Incidentally,
don't think I'm bitter
because of some
personal setback.
By the standards
of a mindless,
barbaric civilization,
I've been pretty lucky.
I was married
to a beautiful woman,
who had family money.
For years we lived
on Beekman Place.
I taught at Columbia.
String theory.
JESSICA:
What's the matter, Boris?
I'm dying!
JESSICA: What is it?
I'm dying!
Should I call
an ambulance?
No! No, not now! No, not tonight!
I mean, eventually!
Boris, everybody dies.
It's unacceptable!
Your panic attacks are
getting more frequent
and more intense.
You have to go
back on your medicine.
I'm not going back
on my goddamn medicine.
I won't have my mind
befuddled by chemicals
when I'm the only one
who sees the whole picture
for exactly what it is.
Where's the goddamn vodka?
Boris, I have clients to see
tomorrow morning.
It is 4:00 a.m.!
Clients. Right.
Wealthy bankers.
To design their
chic apartment,
to fill it full of art and
expensive possessions,
so they can
flaunt their money
and be in the top 1%
of this shameful,
violent, prejudiced,
illiterate,
sexually repressed,
self-righteous nation!
Christ, it is 4:00 a.m.
Can you spare me this sophomoric tirade!
I'm a man with
a huge worldview.
I'm surrounded
by microbes!
And what about me?
Am I a microbe?
Is our son at Yale
a microbe?
Let's face it,
Jessica, okay?
Our marriage hasn't
been a garden of roses.
Botanically speaking,
you're more of
a Venus flytrap.
You are a very
difficult man
to live with.
Is that why you
had an affair?
I didn't have an affair.
It was a brief
interlude of infidelity,
and it happened years ago.
You still can't forget it!
I see everything
so clearly now.
Everything!
I married you for
all the wrong reasons.
What's that
supposed to mean?
You're brilliant.
I wanted someone
to talk to.
You loved classical music,
you loved art,
you loved literature.
You loved sex!
You loved me!
Those sound like
pretty good
reasons to me!
Yes! Exactly!
That's the problem!
That's the problem!
It was rational,
it made sense!
I don't know
what went wrong.
When you examine it,
there is so much
right about us.
On paper we're ideal.
But life isn't on paper.
Boris?
Boris, what are you doing?
Close the window!
Boris!
Can you believe
I hit the canopy?
I hit the goddamn canopy.
Months in the hospital!
Moron doctors!
Look. Look at this limp.
I never had a limp before.
Meanwhile, I divorced Jessica,
moved downtown and gave up.
Checkmate,
you little patzer.
Hey! He's only eight years old,
Mr. Yellnikoff.
You're supposed to
be teaching him...
He'll be an
incompetent idiot at 58.
More important than
how I make my living,
is why I bother
to live at all.
Almost 100 years
after the abolition
of slavery,
a man couldn't play
a game of baseball
in the big leagues
if his skin color
was black.
You're harping
on one point.
Oh, good.
Okay, forget blacks.
Take Jews.
What?
- Here we go.
For years they
restricted the
number of Jews
in schools,
medical schools.
In America,
as much as they
hated blacks,
they hate Jews
even more.
Blacks they were
scared had
too big a penis.
Jews they hated,
even with little penises.
For God's sake,
I'm eating here.
You!
I've been looking for you.
I want to talk to you.
- Who are you?
Did you pick up
a chessboard
full of pieces
and hit my son with it
at his lesson today?
That idiot's your son?
Do me a favor.
Don't send that cretin
to me anymore.
I can't teach
an empty-headed
zombie chess.
I'll have you know
that he is
a very bright child.
In your opinion.
In your opinion.
Which is skewed,
because he's your
unfortunate issue.
So you threw
a chessboard at him?
I didn't throw it at him.
I picked up the board
and dumped the pieces
on his head
as an object lesson
to shake him out of
his vegetable torpor.
You wait until my
husband gets back
from Florida.
What's he doing in
Florida without you?
He will punch you
in the nose.
Her husband's in
Fort Lauderdale.
He's probably hanging
out with naked coeds
on spring break.
He tells her it's
a business trip.
Your son's an imbecile.
Teach him tiddlywinks,
not chess.
You handled
that beautifully, Boris.
JOE: You know,
you should open
the Boris Yellnikoff
Charm School.
BROCKMAN:
Let's get out of here.
It's late. I'm tired.
JOE: Good night, Boris.
What? What are you doing?
Where are you going?
That's it?
MELODY: Sir?
- Hey! What?
What the hell
are you doing?
My God, you scared me.
For God's sake!
You creep up
on me like that,
you little vagrant.
What do you want?
Can you help me
get something to eat?
Oh, God, no,
I don't carry any money.
Now, come on, you can
tell that to your partner,
wherever he's hiding.
Please, I'm so hungry!
Back up! Back up!
I haven't had anything to eat all day.
I think I'm going to faint.
Yeah, listen,
I'm wise to that scam,
little girl, okay?
I know about
professional
beggar school.
Please, I'm desperate.
God, stop that!
You look terrible!
What's wrong with you?
Just... All right.
Come up for two minutes.
That's it. And then...
And then go.
Thank you!
Two minutes, okay?
That's it.
# Happy birthday to you
# Happy birthday to you
# Happy birthday, dear Boris
# Happy birthday to you
# Happy birthday to you
# Happy birthday to you
# Happy birthday, dear Boris
# Happy birthday to you #
Is this your birthday?
BORIS: You don't know
you have to sing
twice
to get the germs off?
You said you were starving.
What do you like?
I like oysters,
blackened redfish,
gumbo, crab legs,
black-eyed...
Are you nuts?
What do you think
I'm running?
A Creole restaurant?
How about
a can of sardines?
Oh, yes, please.
Gumbo.
So what's your name?
Melody. Melody Celestine.
Melody Celestine.
Melody Saint Anne Celestine.
It's French.
My mama's family was
from New Orleans.
I'm from Mississippi,
Mr...
Um...
Muggeridge.
Lionel Muggeridge.
Mr. Muggeridge.
Eden, Mississippi.
You ever hear of it?
No, I haven't.
Not even the people
who live there
have heard of it.
So...
So what are you
running away from?
Home.
Could you be more specific,
Melanie?
Melody. Melanie was
from
Oh, yeah.
I preferred the one
who played Scarlett.
MELODY: Why?
Melanie was the nice one.
She marries Ashley.
Ashley.
What an imbecile!
I couldn't stand him,
I couldn't stand his wife,
that goody two-shoes,
sexual nothing.
Scarlett, bitch that she was,
with those green eyes...
You know,
I came in first dressed
as Scarlett O'Hara
in one of the pageants.
BORIS: Pageant?
- Mmm-hmm.
My mom always
used to keep me busy
in all these beauty contests.
That's why I didn't
get to schooling much.
All right,
my advice to you,
go back home.
Oh, no,
I'm never going back home.
You're a
brainless little twit
who won't last
three days in New York.
You'd be dead
now of starvation
if I hadn't a heart
as big as all outdoors.
I can't go back home,
Mr. Muggeridge.
All right,
stop calling me Muggeridge.
But that's your name.
No, it's not my name.
My name is Boris Yellnikoff.
I was using an alias.
I thought, who knows,
you might be
from the Taliban
or something.
Can I stay here?
Stay here?
What are you? Nuts?
How old are you?
I'm 21.
Twenty-one? Yeah.
You're 21 like
I play for the Yankees.
Twenty-one!
You're a professional
athlete with that limp?
Oh, Christ!
All right, look,
I don't want to go back.
Okay? I want to
make a new life here
in New York.
You'll wind up a prostitute,
like those Asian girls
who come here
full of high hopes.
And then they wind up
turning tricks to keep alive.
And many of them are
actually good-looking.
That's so funny you
just mentioned tricks!
You know, I do magic.
I do. I can show you.
I just need...
Do you have any
silk handkerchiefs?
Yeah, you know,
some other time,
you're...
Look, you're a sweet kid.
Stupid beyond
all comprehension,
but you'll
never survive here.
You got nothing
going for you.
Zero. Zilch.
You know, you may be
beauty contest material
in the Deep South,
but this is the big time.
Here, you're a three.
A five maybe
after you bathe.
Did you get that limp
playing for the Yankees?
Imbecile child.
Brainless inchworm.
I didn't play
for the Yankees!
I was being
sarcastic before.
Oh, you...
I took it seriously.
Yes.
I usually get jokes.
At the church's social,
I was the comedian twice.
I've a way with jokes. Yes.
- Really?
Spare me
and just get out.
No, Mr. Muggeridge...
Stop calling me
Muggeridge, okay?
I already explained that!
I know, I know.
I'm sorry. I just...
I just need a place to
stay for a few nights,
till I get on my feet.
I don't have
anywhere to go.
And if you throw me out
and I wind up
an Asian prostitute,
that's gonna be
on your conscience.
I give up.
Sleep on the couch, imbecile.
I'm too tired to prolong
this brutal exchange
between a bedraggled microbe
and a Nobel-level thinker.
Keep out of my way.
I will, I promise.
I'm just gonna use
the little girl's
to freshen up,
and then I'm gonna
go right to sleep.
Yes, yes,
use the little girl's.
Freshen up.
Don't forget to
tip the attendant.
MELODY: I won't.
Thank you so much, Mr...
Oh, what?
You were going to say Muggeridge again?
- No!
It's Boris Yellnikoff!
You call me Muggeridge one more time,
I'm gonna throw you
out the goddamn window.
Do you mind if
I watch a little TV?
Yes, I do, simpleton.
I just like to turn
some on at
night to unwind.
Yeah. You touch that dial,
I'll unwind your head
with my bare hands.
How about that?
Did you hear about Boris?
- What?
I tried to call him
yesterday
and a woman
answered the phone.
No! Who is she?
He got conned
into letting some
little runaway
bed down in his apartment
while she looks for
a job and gets settled.
Apparently she's
never been to
New York before
and she's asked him
if he would
show her around.
Boris is going to be sightseeing?
- Yeah.
Not a chance.
- No way.
No way.
BORIS: My whole life
I've lived in New York,
I never wanted to
go to Grant's Tomb.
Now I know why.
- Why?
I should never go
to a tomb, ever.
My mom brought me
up to believe that
the good Lord has a plan
that we're all a part of.
He has His eye
on the sparrow.
Yeah, I pity the sparrow.
I'm not getting
into heaven, though.
I sinned.
You? You're kidding.
You sinned?
I made love
before I was married.
Oh, my God.
Plenty of my friends have,
but in my house,
that's just unforgivable.
I just couldn't
resist Bobby Klaxon.
All right, okay,
spare me the details,
all right.
No, it was
really beautiful!
I mean, he was just this
pretty boy guitar player
in this amazing rock band.
I mean, if you think
you're a genius,
he can double
on the drums.
No! Doubles on drums?
Yeah.
All the girls
had a crush on him,
but he liked me.
He was so sweet
and sensitive,
and he caught
the biggest catfish
in Plaquemines County.
I wondered who
caught that catfish.
Hey, you know,
my mom always told me
that it was gonna
hurt the first time,
you know, she said it was,
you know,
it's a woman's duty
to just lie down,
bear it and...
You know, she said
there were a lot of
perversions involved,
and that, you know,
it's God's will,
you shouldn't do it
unless you were married
and you planned
to have kids and...
She said it could
be dangerous,
but I just felt
like it was
the most natural
thing in the world.
You know,
it just felt right.
And all the little
extras were just fun.
It wasn't complicated at all.
And I think Bobby
really liked it,
because he was
going to dump
his Betty Jo Cleary,
this girl he was
going steady with.
But I wouldn't,
I wouldn't hear of it.
It was just what it was,
you know,
it was a nice moment
behind the tent
at the fish fry.
That is the most
disgusting story
I've ever heard.
You and this
adenoidal guitar player
slaking your lust
at some barbaric
social function.
You don't like
to make love?
No, I do not. No.
That's crazy!
Boris, do you want to
be buried or cremated?
All right,
I really don't want to
talk about that. Okay?
I think I want
to be cremated.
All right,
will you shut up, cretin?
There's no worms.
What is this?
A knish.
And what's it made of?
I've been eating
these things for years,
they're delicious.
I don't know
what's in them.
I don't want to
know what's in them.
Don't even talk about it!
BORIS: Oh, my God!
The horror! The horror!
Boris!
Are you all right? What happened?
- No, I'm not all right.
Are you sick?
- No.
Did you have a bad dream?
Yeah, it was terrible.
Come here. It's okay.
- Oh, I can't...
Oh, baby, you're sweating.
Come sit down.
Night sweats.
I get them.
I used to think
it was AIDS,
but it's just that
I have a morbid
fear of the dark
and you turned
my night-light off!
Oh, I'm sorry.
Does your stomach hurt?
Could it be the kwish?
Knish! Not kwish.
Well, here,
I'll put something on TV.
I saw the abyss.
Don't worry,
we'll watch something else.
Oh, this is...
- Yeah.
Fred Astaire. Yeah.
Leave that.
That's good.
Leave that.
BORIS: There,
that's it, okay?
Can we get
the hell out of here?
Oh, my God, that's it!
It's the actual one!
I've only seen it
in pictures!
"Bring me your tired,
your poor, your huddled masses..."
I'm surprised
you know that,
terrible as it is.
I closed with it for
the Miss Greenwood,
Mississippi pageant.
I think it's so moving.
But the huddled masses
were never welcomed
with open arms.
Soon as they came over,
each ethnic group
was met with
violence and hostility.
Each one had to claw
and fight its way in.
People always
hated foreigners.
It's the American way.
Our pageants like to
focus on the positive
things about America.
Yeah. The blacks were
kidnapped from Africa!
Chained in ships!
My daddy says that
America bends over
backwards for the blacks
because we feel guilty,
and it's crazy.
Oh, yeah, your daddy.
Your daddy's a cracker.
He's a bigot moron.
Your daddy!
Well, you're probably right,
'cause you're a genius,
but for a little
Mississippi girl like me,
this is really exciting!
So what kind of genius
are you, anyway?
What kind?
Yeah, what are
you genius at?
Quantum mechanics.
Yeah, but what field?
Like, music?
When you see
kids tossing a ball,
does it ever make you
miss spring training?
All right, I've never
played for the Yankees.
Do you understand that?
I have never
played any sports
whatsoever in my life!
Okay? Ever!
Joe, Leo,
you gotta help me out.
I can't take it anymore.
Just kick her out.
Can you believe it's
been a month already?
BROCKMAN: A whole month?
God, time flies.
Well put.
Well, at least
is she pretty?
She's won some
beauty contests.
No.
Tall? Short? Blonde?
Describe her.
Well, she's blonde.
Nice height. Nice eyes.
Didn't quite realize
how blue they were
that first night.
Her face is
a little more
symmetrical
than I had
originally conceived.
She's not a ten.
In a pinch, six.
Good in bed?
How would I know?
I just want her out.
Why, there'll just be the two of us left,
and we can imagine the music.
We can pretend there's a
big orchestra of violins
You know, it's been proven
television eats away the brain.
Oh, hi! Shoot,
I was gonna surprise you!
What? What's all this?
I'm making you
a special dinner.
Really? For me?
- Yeah.
And me, 'cause
we're celebrating.
We are? What is it?
Crawfish!
I found some at the market.
Jesus. It's stinking up
the whole house!
No, they're so good.
You'll love them.
Listen, Melody, seriously,
we have to talk.
Oh, yeah. I know.
We'll talk over dinner.
It's almost done.
Melody, you're
a very nice young woman.
Really, very nice.
You have a lot of
nice attributes,
but, you know,
you just can't continue
to stay here ad infinitum.
Yeah, yeah,
but that's my news.
Guess what?
I got a job!
I can start
paying you rent.
Rent? I don't want
you to pay me rent!
I want my life back.
What kind of job?
I start tomorrow
as a dog walker.
A dog walker?
Oh, my God.
Seriously...
Melody, don't you think
you should go back home
and finish high school,
maybe even go to college?
I thought the other night
you were talking about
how America has
one of the worst
education systems
in the Old West.
No, no,
the Western world.
Yeah, right, exactly,
and how most colleges
just turn out mindless
zombie morons.
You could benefit
from classes.
I think
the crawfish are ready.
What is that song?
They played that song
the first time
I went out with Jessica.
Where did you go?
We went to a dance.
We were both students
at the University of Chicago.
She had a high IQ
and a low-cut dress.
Boy, they really
don't write them
like they used to.
Oh! That's a cliche.
Ah! Good, Melody.
You caught it.
Well, you always
get so mad
when I do them.
Yeah, I shouldn't really.
Sometimes a cliche
is finally the best way
to make one's point.
Boris,
what would you say
if I was to say
that I was developing
a little crush on you?
I'd say don't.
Why?
Because anything deeper,
more significant between us,
is out of the question.
Because why?
Because it's
too preposterous
to even dignify
with an answer.
It is?
Every single thing
is against it.
Our ages, our backgrounds,
our brains, our interests.
Not to mention,
I have no desire
to have a relationship
with a woman, any woman,
nor any urge to make love,
nor any desire to be anything
but isolated
from the world.
And, you know,
you're a beautiful girl
who should be meeting
normal healthy men
and going out.
Yeah, but I don't like
normal healthy men.
I like you.
I...
You're hallucinating!
I'm sure you'll make
some man very happy
at a fish fry
or a dog fight
or however you
people spend time.
You really think
I'm beautiful?
I admit I didn't give
you your full due
at first, physically.
However, as only
a great mind can do,
I've reassessed
my position,
and changed my mind.
So you could never
think of marrying me?
Have you lost your mind?
Why on Earth
would you even fantasize
about such a thing?
What could I offer you,
but a bad temper,
hypochondriasis,
morbid fixations,
reclusive rages
and misanthropy?
And what could you
offer me?
A character
out of Faulkner,
not unlike Benjy.
The answer to
your question is no.
I think you should
stay here for a while,
accumulate some money,
and then find
a place of your own,
and move on with your life.
Well, what about your life?
Let me teach you
something about love.
Okay?
Naturally,
there are exceptions
to what I'm going to say,
but they're
the exception,
not the rule.
Love, despite
what they tell you,
does not conquer all.
Nor does it
even usually last.
In the end, the romantic
aspirations of our youth
are reduced to
whatever works. Okay?
Why do I think
your bark is worse
than your bite?
Cliche, Melody.
Oh, I don't care!
If the shoe fits, wear it,
and that's another one.
We need to talk
for a minute.
Can you believe
this little inchworm
setting her sights on me?
Yes, yes, we had
some pleasant moments.
Some dinners,
some walks in the park.
I gave her the benefit
of my vast knowledge
and experience.
Tried to impart to her
the perceptions and values
of a truly
original mentality.
I only wish I could do
a Pygmalion on her.
But if Henry Higgins
ever tried to
transform Melody
Saint Anne Celestine,
he, too, would have
jumped out the window.
Come on.
Oh, boy! New friends.
- I'm sorry.
Oh, yeah.
They like each other.
It's okay.
I rather like dogs.
Well, I'm more of
a cat person, myself.
I just do this
professionally. Sorry.
I never met
a professional
dog walker.
Really? It's not
really the career
that I want, but...
What do you want to do?
I'd like to work
with children.
You're very pretty,
you know that?
Shut up! Thank you.
Can I ask your name?
It's Melody.
Melody Saint Anne Celestine.
What a beautiful name!
Mine's Perry Singleton.
It's nice to meet you.
- Yes, nice to meet you.
May I walk along
with you?
I don't see why not,
you know,
since we're all
doomed anyway.
Pardon me?
Well, you know,
everything ends.
I don't think I follow.
Well, you know,
it's like the cosmos,
or eternity.
Whichever's bigger.
I just know that
we're all flying apart.
What is that?
What is that?
Is that a move?
Well, I thought
your bishop was...
My bishop what? What?
You patzer, you earthworm!
How many times do
I have to tell you?
You don't take that pawn.
That's called
the poisoned pawn,
because look!
Boris!
- Look what happens!
Sorry, Mr. Yellnikoff.
-Yeah, you're sorry, you're sorry.
Use your head next time,
you won't be sorry!
Boris!
Yeah. Do your
homework next week.
Don't waste my time.
Hey!
- Poisoned!
I got off work early
today and I thought
maybe we could
walk home together.
Maybe I can make
black-eyed peas and
crab cakes for dinner.
No, I'm not hungry.
What's the matter?
My ulcer's been
killing me all day.
I thought you
didn't have an ulcer.
No, I said they
can't find an ulcer,
not that I don't have one.
Those malpractice
medical mental midgets.
They drop that endoscope
down my throat
and probe me
like coal miners,
and they always
come up with nothing!
Well, guess
what happened today?
I got to talking to
this boy on the job,
and he asked me
out on a date.
Really?
- Mmm-hmm.
I could tell he
liked me right off
and we went and had coffee
and just had, you know,
funny banter.
You know what banter is,
it's like flirty talk.
Yeah, yeah,
I'm familiar with banter.
Yeah, so, anyway,
he asked if I had
a boyfriend.
I said, "Not really."
He said, "I'll pick
you up Friday at 8:00."
What do you think?
Great. I just hope
he's not a Ted Bundy,
you know.
A who?
You have to
keep an eye out
for serial killers.
He's not a serial killer.
At least he didn't
mention it.
Yeah, well,
you have to be careful.
Sometimes they put you
in the trunk of a car
and you can't breathe.
I'm not...
I'm serious.
I told him your theory
about capital punishment.
What did you say?
That it should include
people that don't pick up
after their dogs,
people who ride their
bikes on the sidewalk,
people who call
mothers "moms" and...
I can't remember them all,
you have so many.
How do I look?
- Subnormal.
Why? What's wrong?
That's an awfully
aggressive ensemble.
You looking to wind up
in an abortion clinic?
MELODY: I want
to look nice.
Just kind of
give him an idea
of what he might be in for
if he plays his cards right.
Oh, yeah?
What's he in for?
All the stuff
with a woman
that you reject,
because you're a genius
and you're above it all.
But I happen to be
pretty sharp, too,
and I have a natural talent
in the field of
fooling around.
Yeah, well, I just hope
you're saving your money
so you can move out
quickly, you know,
now that you're working.
MELODY: Hi, Perry!
PERRY: Hey. Sorry I'm late.
I got stuck on the train.
No, it's fine.
Come on in.
This is Perry.
Hi. Your daughter
is very lovely,
Mr. Celestine.
I'm not her father.
Grandfather?
Perry, I told you
I was staying
with a friend.
So what do you do, Perry?
He's studying.
Investments and
investing things.
You got any
identification?
Pardon me?
You know,
driver's license,
birth certificate.
No, sir. I never
carry around my
birth certificate.
Why would I?
Be careful,
Bundy sometimes
posed as a banker.
Oh!
I'm just gonna go
finish getting ready.
I'll be right back.
Melody tells me you're
a very brilliant man.
If an IQ of 200
is brilliant.
She explained
to me your theory about
life being meaningless.
Don't let it
spoil your evening.
Okay, let's go, Perry.
Okay.
Hey! Come here.
Don't give him any
information about me.
Like what?
You know, dates,
credit card numbers,
blood type, things like that.
Goodbye, Boris.
Oh, and hey,
if I'm not here
when you get back,
don't worry.
Oh? Where are you going?
Out.
- Okay, fine.
Yeah, I have friends, too.
- Okay. Yeah.
I even heard the
opening's supposed
to be good.
Yeah, they are.
Have you seen
them before?
No, no. This is
my first concert
in New York.
You didn't tell me that.
Get the hell out of here.
In America,
they have summer camps
for everything.
Rich kids,
basketball camp,
magic camp.
JOE: Tennis camp.
- Tennis camp. Movie director camp!
They should have
a concentration camp.
Two weeks mandatory
for all kids growing up,
so they would
finally understand
what the human race
is capable of.
JOE: Brilliant!
Except who'd send their kid
to a concentration camp?
BORIS: A responsible parent
who wants their child
to grasp reality.
All right, all right,
all right, let's change
the subject.
Meanwhile,
Harry Lawson died.
BORIS: Harry Lawson?
Yeah, I heard.
Yeah. Just celebrated his 51st birthday.
- Really?
What a great chemist.
But he was a smoker.
A smoker. The minute a person dies,
he's a smoker
or overweight.
Hey, I got news for you,
thin non-smokers die, too.
Okay?
Abstinence isn't
going to save you.
You're pleasant tonight.
What are you talking about?
BROCKMAN:
Where's Melody tonight?
She's out listening to
some eardrum-busting
bilge posing as music.
I thought you were
going to kick her out.
Well,
hopefully this guy tonight
will take her off my hands.
You know, why not?
I mean, she's pretty.
Now she's pretty?
What? I'm just saying
she's not atrocious-looking.
That's all.
I'd say a seven or eight.
BORIS: Anybody here?
Oh, you're up!
Yeah, I just got in.
And what did you do?
I went dancing
at a Latin club.
It was limbo night.
Shut up!
You were talking about
people and politics
and all that stuff
you guys like to hate.
How was your date?
It was a big washout! Yeah.
- Really?
This particular
rock band wasn't
any good?
I don't know how
you can differentiate?
No! No, the music was fine.
Just that guy
and his friends!
I just...
What?
Well, his taste! He just...
He likes everything.
Life, love, human beings!
And the couple that
we double-dated with,
they were just protons!
Protons?
Do I mean protons?
Cretins!
Cretins, that's
what I mean.
Yeah, they didn't know
the first thing about
string theory.
I think you're
a little drunk.
I did have a few drinks.
But can you blame me?
Hanging out with
those inchworms?
I mean, they actually
think that love is
the answer to everything.
I told them
about Jethro Paige
from back home.
He got caught
doing it with a sheep.
Making love with a sheep.
And they were all
laughing and everything,
but I just looked at them
and said, "Folks,
"as Boris would say,
whatever works."
What are you looking at?
Unbelievable.
The chance factor in life
is mind-boggling.
You entered the world
by a random event
somewhere along
the Mississippi.
I, having emerged
through the conjoining
of Sam and Yetta Yellnikoff
in the Bronx,
decades earlier.
And through an astronomical
concatenation
of circumstances,
our paths cross.
Two runaways
in the vast, black,
unspeakably violent
and indifferent universe.
Can you believe
I married her?
What possessed me?
This search in life
for something
to give the illusion
of meaning.
To quell the panic.
All right,
so it's been a year.
Three hundred
and sixty-five days
of married life.
And you know what?
Not the worst year
of my life, either.
What are these?
They're grits.
Seriously?
- Mmm-hmm.
They're actually disgusting.
Yes, my life
is circumscribed,
but I manage
to avoid stress.
I've achieved
a delicate balance.
And as long as
I can maintain it,
I feel less inclined
to ending it.
Oh, no, no, no.
Unacceptable. Come on, this is not good.
- What?
I like music
I can dance to.
I know, I know,
but this is brutal.
Here, you know
what I want you to do?
Put this on. Okay?
And then when I come out,
we'll discuss it.
All right, I'll try.
It's Beethoven's
Think of the music
as fate knocking on the door.
Maybe a little story
will help you appreciate it.
Fate knocking
on the door.
Mother?
- Melody!
Oh, it's you!
Oh, my God.
It's my baby!
I finally found you,
praise Jesus!
How did you find me?
Oh, my prayers
were finally answered!
I can't...
You're just the last
person I expected to see.
Well, when you
least expect it,
fate has a way of
knocking on your door.
Yeah, it does. Okay.
Oh, you have a bag.
What are you doing here?
Well, I was trying
to find you, honey.
Why?
I came to
find you, honey!
You did?
Oh, we searched
and searched.
The police looked
for clues.
Everything led
to a dead end.
Whoa!
How we worried.
I developed crow's feet
from the worrying.
Now look here.
I had a little work done.
Mother,
I left you a letter.
I told you
I'd be all right.
Melody Saint Anne,
I'd hardly call
this all right!
Well, what's
wrong with it?
What's wrong?
What's happened
to your senses?
Everything's wrong.
You're living
like a sharecropper.
But it's clean
as a whistle.
I clean it myself
every day.
You clean?
You don't have a woman?
Boris can't
really afford help.
Who?
- Boris.
Who's Boris?
My husband.
What?
That's right, Mama,
I got married.
And he's taken you
to live here?
No, no,
I moved in with him.
Oh...
I have to have a drink.
I need to sit.
I need an anesthetic.
Okay, okay, have a seat.
We don't have any
bourbon or nothing.
Just bring me the drink
with the highest volume
of alcohol you have.
You know, Mama,
I'm kind of happy.
Kind of happy?
You leave
a loving home in Eden,
run off with
some crazy kid,
I'm guessing
he's a rock musician
who can't earn
a respectable living,
and you wind up
in this decadent city,
living in a rattrap.
This is exactly
why I ran away.
Why, why, Miss Sweet Pea?
Why did you forsake
your loving home?
Because, Mama, you're...
You're overbearing.
That's it.
You're overbearing
and you fail to
see the big picture.
What big picture
are you talking about?
I don't know.
All I know is
that nothing moves faster
than the speed of light,
so you may as well relax.
I'm just gonna have
a little moment of prayer.
Mama, you're still
caught up in that
Christian superstition?
BORIS:
# Happy birthday to you
What's that?
That's Boris.
It's his birthday?
MELODY: No, he's just
washing his hands.
# Happy birthday, dear Boris
# Happy birthday to you #
Who's this?
MELODY: Boris,
this is my mother.
Mother, my husband.
Mama! Mama!
Walk her around,
she's obviously
a boozehound.
Mama, are you all right?
Did he drug you?
- What?
Are you on sodium pentothal?
- No.
That's what they do,
the secular humanists.
It's uncanny.
She's exactly the kind of
moron you described.
You are not
the gentleman
I was expecting.
I'm sure not.
I'm sure you'd be happy
if she married
the guy who caught
the biggest catfish
in Plaquemines County.
I'd be happier if
she married the catfish.
No, you see, Mama,
Boris is a genius.
Okay?
He doesn't have
a lot of patience
for us inchworms.
We, we inchworms.
- We.
Some genius.
I was almost nominated
for a Nobel Prize.
That's right, Boris.
And what was it for again?
Best Picture?
MARIETTA: I need more booze.
MELODY: You know,
you never said
how you found me.
Oh, Melody.
I have a sad tale
to tell you.
What happened, Mama?
Your father left me.
Oh.
MARIETTA: Aren't you shocked?
MELODY: No.
And with who,
of all people?
My best friend, Mandy.
- Your best friend, Mandy.
How did you know?
- Oh, Mama.
It was as plain as
the nose on your face.
Cliche, sorry.
MARIETTA: At first
I thought he was
acting peculiar,
because things was going
so bad for us, darling.
How often did you
have intercourse?
Are you going to close
that insulting mouth?
By bad,
I mean he lost
a lot of money
in the stock market
after you left
and we were forced
to sell the house.
You sold the house?
- I'm sorry, yes. We took a beating,
because we were
so desperate.
And then he lost his job,
the company went
out of business.
And then we
spent all our savings
on medical bills,
'cause I came down
with a case of
the shingles!
Oh, my God.
Christ, this is like Job.
No locusts?
Darling,
I turned to Jesus
in a deeper way
than I had ever
done in my life.
I prayed and I prayed,
every day and every night,
asking God to help me.
Let me guess what happened,
your shingles got worse.
I said, "Lord,
just give me one sign
"that all my suffering
is for a purpose."
I said, "Please, God,
just say something."
"Break your silence.
I can't take
any more misery!"
Nothing, right?
And all that money you put
in the tin box every Sunday.
Abortion is murder,
that's the long
and short of it.
That's how I feel. Well...
- Even if the woman is raped?
Why are you wasting
your breath, Brockman?
You're dealing
with an aborigine.
You don't mind
killing the unborn,
but when some fiend
has raped and murdered,
you're against
giving him that
big old injection?
Well, not me,
Mr. Genius,
and I don't care
how many Academy
Awards you've won.
I've never won
an Academy Award
and I've never played
for the Yankees!
Where's the little girl's? Thank you.
- It's back there.
Don't forget to sing
before you sit.
Oh.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
I realize
this is forward,
but who's that
beautiful young girl
you're with?
May I ask why
you want to know?
Well, because
she's very beautiful.
And I'm assuming
she's your daughter?
What did you say
your name was, darling?
Randy. Randy Lee James.
- Randy Lee James.
Nice to meet you.
It's too good.
I think they're putting
mayonnaise in here.
No, they can't put
mayonnaise in hummus.
Hello.
Oh, thank you.
Who were you
talking to?
I wasn't talking
to anybody. Nobody.
Listen, listen,
I want to go
someplace fun.
Take me someplace fun!
It's New York! Let's go.
Boris, where can I
take her that's fun?
How about
the Holocaust Museum?
Oh, for God's sake, Boris.
- No.
Oh, the wax! The wax figures.
- Oh, yes.
Yes, yes, let's go. Come on.
- Let's do that.
It was so nice to meet you, Leo.
- You, too. Have a nice day.
Bye. Bye, bye.
Bye. Have fun!
You know, I have to say,
even with a textbook
right-wing mentality,
your mother-in-law has
beautifully shaped breasts.
You know,
you're a man of learning,
of cultivation of
aesthetic sensibility.
This is what you
take away from the
school-prayer hokum
and "my country
right or wrong"?
Her bosom?
It's not just her bosom.
Her behind is also
beautifully contoured.
Well, I'm sure
you'll have no problem
getting her into bed.
She's vulnerable,
she's stupid and
she's been abandoned.
Personally, I lose
all erotic inclination
when the woman's a
member of the National
Rifle Association.
It's pear-shaped.
Degas used to
distinguish between
an apple-shaped behind
and pear-shaped.
And I'm a big fruit eater.
Melody.
- That's so weird.
Oh, my God.
Oh, hello.
They're made out
of real wax, too.
Oh, it's Billy.
Billy...
Billy Graham!
Oh, sweet pea,
sweet pea,
this is the kind of man
you should be married to,
not that Communist
who sings
every time he
washes his hands.
How long are
you staying, Mom?
Honey, I don't know
where else to go.
I have nothing
to hold onto.
Nothing! I have to
have something.
I mean, I'm never
going to attract a man
again, but you can. Yes.
I don't want to
get in an argument.
Honey, I met a young man today
who is perfect for you.
Mom!
- Yes. Listen to me.
He is talented,
handsome, sweet,
and he has the proper
reverence for life
and its higher purpose.
What are you
talking about?
Face it, Melody,
Boris is not
like a real husband.
He's more of an outpatient
and you're his keeper.
I really wish you
hadn't showed up, Mom.
His name is
Randy Lee James.
Who?
This delightful young actor.
He fell in love with you
at first sight.
He did. He did.
- Mom, I'm married!
I refuse to recognize it.
What are you doing
with a gimpy chess bum
who has to sleep
with the light on?
How'd he get that limp?
He jumped out the window
and his suicide didn't work.
Well, you can't
win them all.
Now, listen,
I have a good lawyer
who can get all
of this annulled.
All of it. Yes. Yes.
- No, no, Mom, no, you're crazy!
Oh, hello.
# Happy birthday, dear Boris
# Happy birthday to you
# Happy birthday to you
# Happy birthday to you
# Happy birthday, dear Boris
# Happy birthday to you #
Who could be calling
at midnight?
Could be burglars,
casing the place.
To steal what?
Your Flomax?
Hello?
Oh, hi.
Yeah, just a second.
It's for me?
- Yes.
Don't give away
any information about me!
MARIETTA: Hello?
Oh, hello, Leo.
It's Leo Brockman.
Brockman?
Really?
Well, that sounds wonderful.
Well, yeah,
Sunday's fine. Yeah.
Okay. Yeah.
See you, darling.
"See you, darling"?
"See you, darling"?
Oh, God, poor Brockman!
Good night, y'all.
I'm going to say
my prayers.
I'm praying
Brockman has herpes.
MARIETTA: That was
so wonderful!
I never in my life
saw a movie in
Japanese before.
Did you like it?
- Oh, yes!
I've never seen
a movie made by
a foreigner.
John, my husband,
took me to see
stupid movies,
which was
all there was.
How do you say this?
"Chateau" what?
BROCKMAN: Meyney.
The what?
- Meyney.
Meyney?
- Yeah.
It is so delicious.
I'm glad you like it.
What do you do?
What do you do, Leo?
I teach philosophy
at the university
around the corner.
Tell me something.
Is Boris really a genius?
There was a time
when he was
a very fine physicist.
Yeah, your daughter's
very good for Boris.
It's my theory that
she keeps him going.
Would you like to see
some pretty pictures
of Melody?
Ooh. Goodness.
BROCKMAN: Well, all right.
Okay.
Look, here they are.
Look at these.
Right there, that's where
she is Miss Natchez.
Wow.
- Look at her. And she was Miss Tupelo.
Oh, God!
Look how gorgeous she is!
She's so beautiful.
I love her! I love her!
Very lovely.
- I was so proud of her.
These pictures are
kind of interesting.
I know!
She's just gorgeous!
And she has this...
She's just my
little sweet pea.
I mean the photos.
Did you take them?
Yes. Yes.
And this?
That's our house.
Well, it was.
Is there more wine?
Yeah. You took all these?
Yes, with my
little old Kodak.
Uh-huh.
These are outstanding.
I mean,
there's such a sense of
texture and composition.
In these? No.
No, I mean it. I know
what I'm talking about.
I occasionally write
about the aesthetics
of photography.
Oh, my God. I have to
tell you something.
Aside from
Melody's career,
there is nothing,
nothing in the whole world
that gave me more pleasure
than taking those snapshots.
Of course, John...
Cheers.
John hated them and
didn't want me to do it.
Why?
- Well,
he actually was fine,
and then I set up
this darkroom
and he thought I was,
like, squandering all
this time on silliness
and I guess he
had a point, but...
I mean, nowadays,
who uses a Kodak anymore?
It's a little Kodak,
and I have to tell
you something, it is...
It is so simple to use.
It's tiny!
I picked it up at,
like, a garage sale
and it just is
so much better than
those big foreign ones.
No, they're pretty good.
They've got a real
haunting quality.
They're very primitive.
I really think you should
talk to my friend
Al Morgenstern.
He runs
a photography gallery.
Why?
Have you got more of these?
Oh, Lord, yes.
You know,
all my travels
with the pageants.
I have the kids
and the towns
and the winners.
And the losers!
The losers are the best.
And then I have
all these show folk,
the twirlers,
the magicians,
the fire eaters, you know,
things like that.
They're amazing.
They've got such
an original quality.
I'll talk to Al
first thing in the morning.
Oh, no. You know, I think
you're making too much
over a little gift
the good Lord Jesus
gave me.
That's not the only gift
He gave you.
You know those clean-cut,
churchgoing young men,
who are model kids,
and good to their neighbors
and quote the Bible,
and never do a wrong thing,
and then one day,
for whatever reason,
they grab a rifle,
go to a tower
and pick off
everyone in town?
Okay, this is her,
but sexually.
She slept with Leo Brockman,
never having been to bed
with anyone before
but her husband,
and suddenly, the genie
was out of the bottle!
She liked sleeping
with Brockman,
and she liked sleeping
with Brockman's friends,
Brockman's acquaintances,
Brockman's acquaintances'
acquaintances.
Well, there's some
pictures over there.
Yes, maybe that.
Okay.
What do you think, Mom?
I'm not sure, you know,
it's for this collage,
and I've had this vision
in black and white
of nude men, women,
body parts, squares.
That sounds confusing.
Well, it's an homage
to lust. Yeah.
To lust.
Excuse me.
Hi, I need
a female opinion.
Which of these two
would a young woman
prefer? I can't decide.
I don't know.
They're both so beautiful.
It depends.
What type is she?
Well, she's quite young
and very lovely-looking.
Blonde hair.
Blue eyes.
Yeah, but what's she like?
Well, okay.
She's from the South,
although she lives
here in New York now.
Really?
- Yeah.
And she's a nanny.
I mean, well,
to tell you the truth,
she's actually
living with some man.
I mean, they're married,
although he's not
the best she can do.
And she thinks
she loves him,
but it's only because
she mistakes his
pessimistic despair
for wisdom,
believing he's a genius.
I'd say she's more
of a nurse to him
than a wife,
because he's
much older than she is.
That sounds so familiar.
I just can't...
I can't put my finger on it.
It's sort of like mine, actually. Yeah.
- It is?
I mean, not exactly,
but I can't help but
seeing some similarities.
I'd say that one.
Okay.
Here.
Here what? For me?
- It's for you.
Yes, I thought I'd buy
you something lovely.
Oh, no, I can't accept
a gift from a stranger.
Well, why not?
I'm married.
Yes, but it may
not last forever.
Well, you know,
nothing lasts forever.
Not even Shakespeare
or Michelangelo
or Greek people.
I mean, even as
we're standing here
talking right now,
we're just flying apart
at an unimaginable speed.
Gee, I never
thought of it that way.
Yeah.
Should we be
holding each other
so we don't fall?
Well, you have to
hold onto whatever
love you can
in this cruel existence.
Speaking of love,
I've been in love
with you ever since
that first moment I saw you,
and met your mother
at the Mogador Cafe
many months ago.
Oh, you're... You're...
Did my mother...
- Randy James.
Oh, the actor! Of course.
I can hear your accent now.
Oh, my mother talks
about you all the time,
and she's always telling me
I have to meet you
and I'm saying, "Why?
Why do I have to meet him?"
"But he's so good-looking!"
And, yeah, you are.
Thank you.
I've moved to New York
permanently now
and I live in a houseboat
with a friend of mine.
You live on a boat?
- Yes, I do.
I'm very romantic by nature,
so I live on a boat
and I read and think
and play my flute...
Mom?
- Oh, be still, Melody.
There's nothing wrong
with expanding
your horizons.
I certainly expanded mine.
You know what?
I'm really sorry, but...
I think that my mother
badly gave you
the wrong impression,
because I'm
happily married.
No, no, no,
no, no, no,
she's not, Randy.
She's nursemaid
to a roach. He is.
Goodbye, Mother.
Goodbye, Mr. James.
I told you you'd
get the hang of it.
Okay, you know what?
Let's just stop.
Let's stop.
Let's stop. Yeah, yeah, yeah, stop, stop.
- Stop?
Yeah. I need to sit for a minute.
- All right.
You know,
I'm just doing it for
the aerobics, anyway.
Otherwise, it's moronic.
I think it's relaxing.
Relaxing?
What? Are you kidding?
It's too nerve-wracking.
To mingle with all
those sub-mentals
on bicycles?
It's like driving a car.
Those hostile,
belligerent morons
all get driver's licenses.
Of course,
to have children,
you don't need a license.
No proof of anything.
You need a license to fish.
You need a license
to be a barber.
You need a license
to sell hot dogs.
You know, you read
about these poor kids,
beaten and starved,
you wonder,
why are these parents
allowed to even have them?
Okay, Boris, Boris.
You know,
sometimes I think
you're so determined
not to enjoy
anything in life,
just out of spite.
You know,
like a child who's
throwing a tantrum,
because he can't
have his own way.
Wow! Listen to you!
That's a reasonably
wise insight
for a simple-minded
type like yourself.
Honestly. Yeah,
you surprise and delight me
sometimes, you know that?
I really don't know
what I'd do without you,
seriously.
What are you doing
with that?
This? Nothing.
I just got it at
the flea market.
Who needs
an antique handkerchief?
I thought it was pretty.
Yeah, but God knows
throughout history
who blew his nose in it.
Marietta? Honey?
MARIETTA: Yes, darling?
I think you should
include these photos
at your opening next week.
I love those photos.
Al, what do you think?
MORGENSTERN: I chose those.
MARIETTA: Oh, you did?
- Absolutely.
Sweetheart, you've managed to make...
- Thank you.
...an existential
statement about
sexual perversity and human freedom.
- Who? Yes.
It's so full of
erotic imagination.
Okay, hold on a sec.
Oh, thank you so much!
Thank you!
Marietta?
Who is it?
- Somebody named Randy Jones?
Oh, Randy, Randy James.
Hello? Hello? Hey!
Young man, hello, hello!
Listen, she's going to be
at Uniqlo at around 3:00.
You can run into her
and try your luck.
You know, she saved
the handkerchief you gave her,
so it's not
a hopeless cause.
And I'm telling you,
I saw fire behind her eyes.
Fire.
Yeah. Good luck, darling.
Who was that?
- Oh, nothing. Come on, gumbo! Let's go.
Who'd have ever
thought that gumbo
would become my
favorite dinner?
All this and
she cooks, too.
Oh, my God! Hello.
So I guess you
just happened to be
shopping here. Right?
Well, I was
buying this shirt,
if you must know.
Uh-huh.
You like it?
It's okay.
- Just okay?
I thought it'd
make me look dashing.
Looks aren't your problem.
Oh, no? What is?
You're too forward.
I think about you a lot.
Well, I don't
think about you.
So what's it like
being married to a genius?
Who wants to know?
I'm sorry. I don't mean
to be a boor, I just...
Just that,
well, you know.
It has its
pluses and minuses.
Yes?
And what are the drawbacks?
I don't know.
I mean...
Well, naturally,
with a very advanced mind,
you find a lot of things
wrong with everything
and, mainly,
he just doesn't
like people.
You know,
he says at the rate
they're going,
they're going to make
themselves extinct.
Right.
It can just be exhausting
being around a genius
all the time.
So what are the pluses
of being the wife of
such a dazzling mind?
Well, he's smart.
You said that.
He's clever.
Uh-huh.
He really means well, you know?
He's just a little crazy.
I guess the good part
is that I'm the wife
of a genius,
which I never
really thought
I could swing.
Why not?
I guess I thought
I'd have to be smarter.
You want to see my boat?
I mean, my friend's boat,
where I live?
I don't think
that's a good idea.
I dreamt about you
last night. I...
Don't use that line.
Because Boris said
that he dreamt
about me last night.
And I really doubt
it's mathematically
possible
for me to be in
two dreams at one time.
It's down there,
on the right-hand side.
Well, this is it.
It's not much,
but it's home and
I don't pay rent, so...
This is kind of sweet,
living on the water.
It rocks
just the tiniest bit,
so I sleep
like a baby on it.
Randy, I don't know
what I'm doing here!
I'm married!
That doesn't mean
I can't have
feelings for you.
You don't
really know me.
Yes, but I'm a romantic
and I believe in
love at first sight.
Well, that's true.
You know, Boris says
that love isn't logical.
And I adore
the way you talk
and the funny things
you say.
Where can it lead?
Let's drink to
love at first sight.
I can't. When I drink,
I get very silly
and touchy and...
That's what
your mum said.
That's why
I bought the bottle.
She's quite a mum.
Don't use that locution.
It's for inchworms.
Sorry.
Is that you
in the picture?
Yeah. That's me in
I bet you're
a really good actor.
I try. Although
I'll never be a genius.
You certainly
are handsome enough
to be a star.
Thank you. I'll cherish
that compliment.
Oh, my God.
- What are you thinking?
Entropy.
- Entropy?
Yeah, entropy.
Boris explained it.
It's why you can't
get the toothpaste
back in the tube.
You mean,
once something happens,
it's difficult to put it
back the way it was?
I mean, Boris says
love is all about luck.
I think so, too,
but isn't that
just because
we're young and we think
we're going to live forever
and then we grow old
and get diabetes, and...
Maybe.
Look, I do agree
there's not much
you can be sure of
in this world, but...
Have you ever heard of
Heisenberg's
Uncertainty Principle?
I've heard of it, yeah.
You know, the observer
influences the experiment?
Uh-huh.
It's just like
when my mother makes love
to one of the guys
she's living with
a certain way
when they're alone,
but when she's in
front of the other guy,
she does it differently.
Is that Heisenberg?
I had no idea
he was so sexual.
Wait. I always carry
some Viagra with me.
That's all right.
I eat a lot of red meat.
I really like the way
these pants fit.
Hey, are you okay?
You seem awfully
quiet lately.
Yeah.
We're going to be late
for Mom's gallery opening.
I hope you're not
coming down with anything.
You know, Brodsky's
kid's got the measles.
Can you still
get the measles?
I had a shot
when I was younger,
but how long
does it last?
Who's that?
I don't know.
I'm not expecting anyone.
Melody!
- Daddy!
Oh, my little girl,
I found you!
Oh, Lord,
your mother and I
searched and searched,
but then we
ran out of leads.
I used every connection
I had at the police force.
We even called the FBI!
But you're okay.
Things are going
to be fine now.
Your ordeal is over.
What ordeal?
You were abducted!
Tell me if my theory
is correct.
You were chloroformed
by polygamous Mormons.
They took you off to
be someone's bride!
I was not abducted.
Didn't anybody
read my letters?
Yeah, but I assumed
you were forced to
write them at gunpoint.
Who's this?
- Who are you?
This is Boris,
my husband.
Boris, your who?
He's my husband.
I'm Mrs. Boris Yellnikoff.
Who are you?
- I'm her husband.
You want to pass out here
or go in the living room?
Where's your mother?
What do you care?
You cheated on her
and then dumped her
for Mandy Blackburn,
of all people!
I made a terrible mistake,
I committed the sin
of self-indulgence.
I've come to beg your
mother's forgiveness.
You might want to
rethink that, Daddy.
I want to see her.
I see death
by culture shock.
You can tell me, Melody,
she has every right
to hate me.
And she does, believe me.
I can handle the truth.
Does she hate me?
Well, it was a pretty
awful thing you did
with her best friend.
Then she hates me?
Yes, yes, she hates you!
I can't stand this.
I hate you
and I just met you!
Lord, you tell me
this creature
took you to bed?
No, no, no, no.
Actually, she took me.
Yeah, when I met Boris,
he hated sex.
Yeah, think of it,
Mr. Celestine.
The absurd choreography,
like a sewing machine,
up and down,
up and down,
up and down,
toward what end?
Making more children?
What the hell are
you talking about?
Reproducing the species
over and over.
Toward what goal?
Carrying out
what moronic design?
What happened to Mandy?
It was a mess,
a nightmare.
Lord, I've sinned!
Please forgive me.
Why do all the religious
psychotics wind up
praying at my doorstep?
Can you tell me?
Lord, in Your
infinite mercy,
I've done wrong.
You want to tell him,
or should I?
Tell me what?
Daddy, there's
nobody out there!
Honest.
You're praying to no one.
You're wasting
your breath,
just like you're
gonna be wasting it
on Mom.
What? You're telling me
she met another man?
Not just a man.
- What?
Daddy, you couldn't
expect her to not,
you know,
move on with her life
and, you know...
Oh, Lord.
What's he like?
He's got four arms
and two noses.
You better butt out,
stranger!
Melody will tell you
I don't need my shotgun
to be a whole
passel of trouble.
Now, I want to
see Marietta!
Now, Dad,
try and remember,
you haven't
seen Mom in a year.
A year is not forever.
How much can
a person change?
And with that,
they entered the gallery.
MARIETTA: I had more people
than I knew what to do with.
Everybody said,
"I'll be naked with you, Marietta!"
And I was like, "Okay."
Oh, my God.
Marietta?
John Celestine!
Look what the cat
dragged in.
Marietta, what happened to you?
- Oh, my God!
Well, darling,
it's you that absconded.
He showed up at
the door today.
Whoa, whoa. "Absconded"?
Yes, yes, with the
promiscuous whore
who called herself my best friend.
- Darling, I'll be...
I'll find you.
Excuse me. Pardon me.
It's over, Marietta.
Mandy and I were
a terrible mistake.
I've come back for you.
Well, honey,
I'm in the middle
of my opening.
Yeah, Dad,
this is Mom's exhibition.
Isn't it great?
Exhibition of what?
Well, the collages.
What? She's thinking
of buying this pornography?
I got news for you,
she's the pornographer.
Marietta, who are you?
John, you never
understood me, honey.
Your vision never extended
beyond the backyard.
You always had
your gun clubs
and your fishing trips
and football.
You never took
a little minute
to find out about me.
And you were always
too busy putting her
in pageants
and coaching her speeches
and teaching her
baton twirling!
Yes, yes, that's true.
I was sublimating
my own creative needs
and forcing them
on our daughter.
You were what?
Yes, she was sublimating.
Sublimating.
Honey, why don't
you go on back
to Mandy Blackburn?
Her pygmy mentality is
much closer to you now.
Much closer.
- Yeah. Well, I can't go back to her.
Oh, why not?
She cast aspersions
on my manhood.
What are we talking?
Size? Duration?
Erectile dysfunction?
Would you mind
your own business?
Marietta, how could you
forsake your own family?
I want us all back home
to start over.
I'm a different woman, John.
I can't believe what
I'm seeing. I mean...
Your clothes are different,
your speech is
a little more affected,
but deep down,
I know you're the same
pretty, small-town,
God-fearing, churchgoing,
pie-baking...
I'm living with two guys.
...Girl Scout mom.
You're what?
I'm an artist.
I don't bake pies.
I don't go to church.
I do collages,
sculpture, photography.
I live in Manhattan
with two men who I love
in a very happy
menage a trois.
JOHN: A what?
We all sleep together.
A menage a trois.
I knew we should
never trust the
goddamn French.
It's amazing, Melody.
Thousands of years ago,
ancient peoples,
Egyptians, Romans, Mayans,
were walking home,
just like us,
discussing where
should they eat
or making small talk.
"Hey, we just
bought a great house
on the Nile with a yard,
"overlooking the
Pharaoh's new pyramid."
Boris...
- Or, "My physician says
"peacock tongues are bad for your heart."
- Boris...
Or, "I'm worried I can't get
my kid into a really good
Aztec preschool."
What the hell does it
all mean now? Zilch.
But they thought
it was important.
Boris, can I talk
to you for a minute?
And I was raised
in a religious home.
Job's wife was my
favorite character
in the Bible,
because she chose death
rather than
obsequious acceptance,
like that masochist
she married.
Boris, Boris,
can we sit down
for a second?
Well, but we have to
go home.
I know, but come here.
I have to say something.
But we always
go home now.
I know. I know.
I know we have
a standard routine.
I need to have my drink,
and a shower.
And, you know,
you see it as routine,
but for me
the consistency helps keep me
from becoming unnerved.
I know you require
a certain ritual.
And then after the shower,
our dinner,
but not crawfish pie
again.
I got indigestion
from it last time.
I thought I had
thyroid cancer.
Boris, I met someone else.
I've fallen in love.
And then some Beethoven,
maybe some Schubert
for a change,
but, you know...
You met someone else?
I'm not saying
I don't have very deep
feelings for you. I do.
You met someone else?
Yes.
And you want us to
live in a threesome,
like your mother?
Boris, when you found me,
I was very young.
You're still very young.
Yes, but I've grown.
I've grown so much.
And mainly because of you.
Yes, it's true.
I have been very patient
with your
phenomenal ignorance.
You can always
count on me
for anything.
I just...
I guess I'm at a very
impressionable age,
and I...
I can't think of a way
to say this well.
You don't have
to say it well.
I want to.
I completely understand.
I do.
This does not run counter
to my convictions that
love relationships are
almost invariably transient.
I don't really think
that's true if they're right.
Really?
You have your own ideas?
Just a couple.
You know, they're not
very deep, but...
As cruel as life is,
I miss participating
in the world.
And I even miss people,
even the inchworms
and the cretins,
because I don't
really think they're bad,
I think they're
just scared.
I think you're making
the correct decision.
Boris...
- I mean it.
I'm a profound
and sensitive soul
with an enormous grasp
of the human condition.
It was inevitable you would
eventually grow tired
of being so grossly
overmatched.
Greatness isn't
easy to live with,
even by someone of
normal intelligence.
You're upset.
I don't expect you
to understand.
How could you?
Believe me,
if I can understand
quantum mechanics,
I can certainly comprehend
the thought process
of a sub-mental
baton twirler.
Boris...
It's okay.
I knew this day would come.
I really did.
The universe is winding down.
Why shouldn't we?
Again!
MAN: I'll have another, too.
She left me.
Can you believe it?
What am I talking about?
I left her. She's alone.
Now, no matter
which way she turns in bed,
she's got a husband.
My wife left me, too.
I'm sure she was beautiful,
just like my wife.
Norman?
Norman was gorgeous.
He was the greatest
runway model
Versace ever had.
I thought you said
your wife.
We were married
in Holland.
You married a guy?
What else?
But that would make you...
What? A widow?
Norman didn't die.
Not a widow, a...
Gay?
A member of the...
Of what?
The homosexual persuasion.
My God.
You make it sound
like a religion.
Yes. If it's a religion,
you could call me devout.
A fanatic.
But that's a sin
against God's law.
God is gay.
He can't be.
He made the whole
universe perfect.
The oceans, the skies,
the beautiful flowers,
the trees everywhere.
That's right.
He's a decorator.
But what do you
miss about him?
I still don't get it.
Everything.
His face.
His kindness,
his sense of humor.
Our mutual passion.
The way we'd dance
and he'd dip me back
and kiss me.
Jesus.
Why did he leave you?
She leave you. Norman.
He wants to live in Paris,
and I can't leave
my sick mother.
Is your mother a woman?
She used to look
like Marlene Dietrich.
What's the difference?
They all hurt you in the end,
every woman,
whether they're
male or female.
Why did yours leave you?
I left her
for her best friend,
but it didn't work out.
Why not?
Can I be perfectly
frank with you?
I don't shock easily.
I couldn't make love to her.
Why not?
It was fine at first,
but then I lost interest.
I wanted Marietta back.
Which is funny,
because in the last years,
I really didn't have
a lot of sexual
interest in Marietta.
That happens
with you heteros.
We always have interest.
Christ, if I'm going
to be honest,
you know, I never,
ever really had
a burning sexual desire
for Marietta.
Why'd you marry her?
It was the thing to do.
Everybody where I lived,
you had a wife
and children and...
Can I really level with you?
Of course.
John. John Celestine.
Of course, John.
I'm Howard Cummings,
nee Kaminsky.
I married Marietta,
because I was afraid.
Of what?
The way I felt
towards the tight end
on the football team.
No.
Every time he got in
the line of scrimmage
and bent over.
Bartender, another round
for my friend and me,
please.
Can you believe
I blew it twice?
I jumped out the window
and landed on a woman
walking her dog.
She got hurt.
I got off scot-free.
Don't you realize
the consequences
of your actions
impact on other people?
Oh, come on.
Seriously.
No. What if you had
committed suicide?
Think, think if
you didn't exist,
how the world would
suddenly change in
ways you can't imagine.
Oh, my God.
You know what?
You sound like
that movie they ram
down your throat
every Christmas.
What?
- What if the guardian angel
had saved Jimmy Stewart,
and Jimmy Stewart
was the guy who
smoked in bed,
and he lived
and caused a fire
that killed 60 people? So?
How about that?
Everybody's life is
still worth saving?
Even if it's Christmas?
Come on, seriously.
You must have
a very dim view
of the human race.
Oh, the human race.
They've had to install
automatic toilets
in public restrooms,
because people
can't be entrusted
to flush a toilet.
Come on, flushing a toilet!
They can't even
flush a toilet!
Visiting time is over.
What? You're kicking me out?
Yeah.
Seriously?
- Yeah. Absolutely.
All right, listen.
Honestly, I'm really
sorry about all this
and is there
anything I can do
to make this up to you?
Can I get you something?
What can I do?
If I can ever walk again,
you can buy me dinner.
What do you do, Helena?
Me? I'm a psychic.
I'm sorry. Really?
I was born with
a very rare gift.
I can see into the future.
If you can see
into the future,
how come you didn't know
I was gonna
jump out a building
and land on top of you?
Maybe I did.
MAN: Happy new year to you.
We're so excited.
Howard is selling the gym,
but we're going to open up
an antique shop in Chelsea.
Yeah. Art deco.
We're going to have
a wonderful collection
of movie posters.
Can you believe
this cracker?
This red state
Neanderthal?
This mindless zombie
of the National
Rifle Association?
My shrink says
that the guns were all
a manifestation of
my sexual inadequacy.
Yeah, if it weren't
for sexual inadequacy,
the National
Rifle Association
would go broke.
He's moved in
with Howard Cummings,
nee Kaminsky.
And not only is
he sleeping with a man,
soon he'll be
celebrating Purim.
More important,
for the first time
in his adult life,
he's happy.
I should have known
why I was failing you,
Marietta,
not fulfilling
your womanly needs.
Which turned out to
be quite considerable.
Mine, too, but not with
the sex I'd been raised
to be attracted to.
You're like
a changed man, John.
Your whole personality
is sunnier.
If only it had
been that way.
I couldn't when I was
making love to you.
I was a square peg
in a round hole,
you should pardon
the metaphor.
Well, I just hope
you two lucked out
and found the right person
in each other.
I know I lucked out.
What about you, Boris?
As you would say
in the crude fashion
of your generation,
I totally lucked out.
It just shows what
meaningless blind chance
the universe is.
Everybody schemes and dreams
to meet the right person,
and I jump out a window
and land on her.
And a psychic yet!
I mean, come on,
talk about
the irrational heart,
not to mention
I've developed
a fondness for grits.
I have a question,
am I a member
of my generation?
Yes. Don't worry.
I'll explain it to you.
Hey, hey, hold on! Hold on!
The ball's about to drop!
Come on!
nine,
eight, seven,
six, five,
four, three,
two, one!
Happy new year!
I happen to hate
New Year's celebrations.
Everybody desperate
to have fun.
Trying to celebrate
in some pathetic little way.
Celebrate what?
A step closer to the grave?
That's why I can't
say enough times,
whatever love
you can get and give,
whatever happiness
you can filch or provide,
every temporary
measure of grace,
whatever works.
And don't kid yourself,
it's by no means
all up to your
own human ingenuity.
A bigger part of
your existence is luck
than you'd like to admit.
Christ, you know the odds
of your father's one sperm
from the billions,
finding the single egg
that made you?
Don't think about it,
you'll have a panic attack.
Boris, what are you doing?
Who you talking to?
What? There's people
out there watching us.
They're out there?
Yeah, yeah,
they're watching. What?
Please, Boris...
- You know...
Well, there was
when we started.
I don't know
how many are left.
Does anybody see
anybody out there?
Out there? No!
No!
Boris!
- No!
See? I'm the only one
who sees the whole picture.
That's what they mean
by genius.
Come on.
Happy new year, Boris.
