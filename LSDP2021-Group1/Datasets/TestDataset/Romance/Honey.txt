Okay. There.
That didn't hurt, did it?
Okay, all set to go.
- Bye, Honey.
Haven't you seen my hip-hop class?
They love it.
But hip-hop can't take you the places
ballet can. All that real dance training.
Ah, here are my girls.
Hi, Dad.
Hi, baby.
Honey.
There's so many beautiful things
in the world, and l just want you
to see 'em.
Ma. So, can we make it
to midtown in 20 minutes?
- Not another video audition?
- As a matter of fact,
l was just heading that way.
And don't worry so much.
Two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight.
- Honey Daniels. And you're with?
- No one right now.
Sorry. The open audition
was this morning. We're not seeing
any more unsolicited dancers.
But the ad said the audition was all day.
lt is, but the open part
ended at noon.
l have a job and couldn't
get off before noon.
Unfortunately, there were
about a thousand girls who could.
Can't l just audition?
Next.
Check it.
That's what l'm talkin' about.
You already gave me that lecture.
l'm gonna keep giving it you.
'Cause if you would have
listened to me,
your ass would have been
famous by now.
For what?
You seen Michael?
He's over there.
Who is that?
That's Katrina.
She in a lot of joints.
Works a lot. She was at the Overdrive.
No, no, not her.
Her.
What up? What up?
You're getting her drunk.
Come on. Keep it coming.
Keep it coming.
Excuse me.
Are you a dancer?
Yeah.
l thought so.
Look, l want you
to dance for me.
Come on, Gina.
No, no, look. Seriously. Seriously.
l'm a-- l'm a video director,
and l'm shooting next week.
Oh, and you wanna offer me the privilege
of slapping on a thong and shaking
my ass in your camera?
Thanks, but l'll pass.
Let's go.
What are you doing?
He's a director.
Every guy's a director
when he wants some booty.
Look, look, listen.
lt's a little loud down here,
so let's go talk about it
up in the V.l.P. lounge.
All right. l heard that.
lt don't matter where we are.
l'm not taking my clothes off.
Who said anything about
taking your clothes off?
Yeah, who said anything about that?
-Jadakiss?
- Wait. Who did you say
you were again?
- My name is Michael.
- Michael Ellis?
- See, l'm the man.
- Yeah, you're all right.
And you are?
Honey Daniels.
Nice to meet you, Honey.
Gina.
lt's nice to meet you, Gina.
Look, Honey.
l want you to come down
and try out for my video.
Here's my card, if you're interested.
You know, give me a call.
Okay, cool.
l'll give you a call.
l mean, l don't wanna seem desperate.
Hey, this is Honey Daniels
calling for Michael Ellis.
Honey Daniels.
Sure, l can hold.
Um, yeah, he can call back.
Wait. Don't you need
my number?
lt's not good when
they don't ask for your number.
##

Why don't you take a break,

Show me some of them moves.
l got a class to teach.
Mm-hmm.

Yo, you want a smoke?
Right here. Right here.
Hey, Honey, it's me Dad.
Honey Daniels, this is Mike Ellis.
Sorry l missed you.

Um, anyway, we start shooting

We're gonna be here

Coming. l'm coming.
Cut! Cut! Cut! Cut.

we gotta get 'em together eventually.
Hey.
You came?
Yeah, you know,

Wait. Come here. Come here.
Michael, who is this?
- Honey.
- Hey.
This is Honey.
Show her the steps.
Everybody else, take five.
l think l got
the first eight counts, okay?
Unbelievable.
All right, fellas,

Hi.
We gotta work in another girl.
- Where would you like me?
-Just find yourself a spot
in the center row, okay?
You in the second row?
Yeah.
- No! Cut. Cut!
lt'll be better.
lt was just my first time through.
lt's all right.
lt's good choreography, though.
lt's good.
All right, still not working here.
Um--
lt is just, uh--
Okay, l'm gonna try something.
l'm gonna try something.
Hi. How are you doing?
Hi.
Good.
Good, good.
Um, l want you to pretend
that you're in a club.
- Excuse me, Michael. What are you doing?
- Directing. You have a problem with that?
And the music's gonna come on.
And l'm gonna want you to move.
Now, don't be nervous.
You're great. l saw you at
the Overdrive and you're great.
Okay.
- Nice.
- All right. Now, see, that--
that is sexy.
- Thank you!
- That is sexy. That is sexy!
- Everybody else,
follow what she's doing.
- You're kidding, right?
l am not.
Whoo!
Uh-huh. Yeah.
Uh, yeah, yo.
Was it all right?
Yeah, yeah.
All right, we're moving in
for a close-up, everyone.
What do you think?
What you doing next week?
Working at the record store?
No.
Working at the club?
Not working at the club?
Not unless you're doing it
for fun.
And you know what else
l've been thinking about?
Your birthday.
Twenty-five's a big one.
We gotta do it up right.
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.
So l'm thinking we should rent
a big old car, roll on down
to Atlantic City.
You sure you wanna spend
all your big faces like that on me?
Are you kidding?
l wouldn't even have these big faces
if it weren't for you.
lt's true, it's true.
l should be your manager.
l don't really care,
to tell you the truth.
Who's that?
l don't know.
Some guy from the center.
- What's wrong with you?
He's fine. Why you duckin'?
- l'm not duckin'.
You duckin'. You duckin'
like a bobblehead.
So, manager, am l bookin'
the limo, or what?
Hell, yeah, you gettin' the limo.
You gettin' the limo, the room,
the Cristal with caviar,
the male strippers--
Oh, my God! lt's you!
Turn it up! Turn it up!
That's right, y'all. That's my friend.
Check it out. Check it out.
She's good,
you know what l mean?
##
Hey! Hey, look!
lt's Honey. She's on TV.
Yo, check it out, man.
See?
- That's Jadakiss and Sheek.
- Those are my boys.
Yo, that's my move.
- For real.
- That's what l'm talkin' about.
My move.
Hey, yo, biter.
Oh, hey.
We caught you on TV.
- Benny saw that you used his move.
- Yeah. Shouldn't l get a check
or something for that?
l haven't even got a check
for it yet. You here for the class?
Yeah. Once Benny saw you
with Jadakiss,
he said maybe
you were cool after all.
Nah. l just figured you might
need some more moves to jack.
- Well, you can show 'em toJoey
and he'll pass 'em along.
- You're not teaching?
No. l got this video
and l'm supposed to be there like now.
You gonna be here tomorrow?
- That's cool. Whatever.
- You should still take the class.
Joey's great.
Who, me? l wasn't gonna go.
l was just dropping off Raymond.
Go on, dog.
Go to your little class.
l'm outta here.
# She was unlike anything
l've ever seen #
# l got to be that one man
leavin' tonight with your hand #
# Girl, what does it take
to get close to you #
# Girl, l'm lovin' the things
that you do #
# Baby, tell me
Can we play this game #
# l'm feeling you
just feelin' me the same #
l swear to goodness.
What up? What up?
Ah, shoot. Now look at you.
ln your bustier and your hooker heels.
Oh, l'm goin' to Papi Chulos.
Oh, word? The gay club?
Shoot, l love the kids.
But l didn't have to wear my heels
for that. l could have worn my sneakers.
- Actually, l'm goin' with Michael.
- Oh, you can't bring me?
lt's kind of a work thing.
You know, charity fund-raiser
with tickets and all.
- Sorry.
- Sounds like somebody's trying
to dip their fingers in the Honey jar.
- Gina, he's my boss.
You say that like you never heard
of Monica Lewinsky.
lt's the video world.
You know, they do their
meet-and-greets at night in clubs.
Oh, okay.
Well, there's only one world--
the real world-- and in that world...
if a man is taking a woman out
on a Friday night in her hooker heels...
You're nuts.
All right, that's him.
How do l look?
Gorgeous.
Make some noise!
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Come on up here.
How you doing, miss?
Hi.
Good to see you.
What up, B.?
What's happening, my man?
How you doin', man?
Lenny's got your spot.
What's up?
What's up? What's up?
Ginuwine, how you doing?
What's going on, baby?
How you doing?
How you doing?
Good to see you.
Ginuwine, this is Honey.
How you doing?
Pleasure to meet you.
Rodney, Honey.
What's up, man?
Nice to meet you.
- Honey, from theJadakiss video, right?
- Yeah.
l caught that.
You was doin' your thing in there.
You was real hot.
- Thanks.
- l hear Mikey's gonna make you
super colossal.
l thought l was making him
look good, but, you know.
You hear that Mikey?
You got to watch her.
Better get them contracts tight.
- So you gonna be in the next one, right?
- Oh, for sure, for sure.
'Cause the next one gotta be crazy.
No doubt, no doubt. That's why l got you
a new choreographer for this one.
- For real? Who?
- This girl right here.
No, but it's all right.
We got two more to do before yours.
So she'll be a pro
by the time we get to you, you know.
Right?
Right.
Cool. Well, you know,
Mikey knows best,
you know what l'm saying?
- Okay, sure.
- l don't know what to say.
Thank you, Mikey.
You're the best.
Thank you, Michael.
You're the best.
- You better get them contracts tight now.
Thank you.
Raymond, is that you?
Honey!
What are you doing out here?
My mama says l have to
do something with my hair.
Your mama's right about that.
You wanna do this on your own,
or should l come with you?
You can come with me.
Cool. So, what are you thinking?
Some braids?
Snoop Doggy Dogg silky-fine
press and curl?
Or maybe do like Mike
and shave it all off?
Hmm, how 'bout braids?
Braids?
All right, cool. Come on.
Come on. They won't bite.
Whoa. Look who's here.
l thought l was gonna have to
watch cable to see you again.
Raymond needs a little trim
and some braids.
Look, little guy.
You see that guy right there?
l know he has a stupid-looking face,
but what's his hair look like?
All right.
Just all right or a little more
than all right?
A little more.
That's right. And you know why?
'Cause he gets his hair cut by me.
l'm gonna send you over there
to Stacey to get braided up.
Now how does that sound?
That's cool.
All right, now you just chill, shorty.
Don't worry about nothin'.
Besides, l never mess up
a kid's head,
especially when his mom's
in the shop.
He's eight. That would have made me 1 4.
- l'm not that kind of girl.
- My bad.
We just peoples.
Yeah, we peoples.
You peoples?
Player, how'd you swing that?
l've been trying to be her peoples
for weeks. Ain't had no luck.
- l got flow.
-
- l got flow too.
You don't think l got some flow?
- Maybe not as much as me.
Whoa. See, now you better
be careful, little man.
You don't watch yourself,
l'm gonna have you runnin' out of here
lookin' like a poodle.
All right, youngblood,
holler at your boy.
lt's tight.
Let me ask you something else.
What if l was
to take Honey out to dinner?
You think that'd be tight too?
That'd be all right.
How's Friday?
Friday l'm working.
Friday night?
These shoots go late. l never know
when l'm gonna get off.
Saturday?
Saturday l'm workin' too.
You're not working
all day Saturday.
Listen, l'll tell you what.
You find out when you're not working,
you get at me.
l'm a busy woman.
l may never have the time.
Baby, that'd be a tragedy.
All right, little cat.
Come on.
- Let us pray.
Heavenly Father,
please bless Chaz...
with game immediately.
So when you gonna get picked up?
l don't know.
But someone's comin', right?
l don't know.
Hey, l'm fiending for a milk shake.
Me too!
Yeah? All right, then.
How 'bout we go get one,
and then you can show me where you live.
Okay.
Cool. Come on.
Do you live there?
Yes.
Let's go.
You gonna knock?
You don't have to wait.
Y'all, shut that noise up now!
Where you been?
l got my hair braided like you said.
- Who the hell are you?
- l'm his dance teacher.
- Dance teacher?
Come on. Get on inside
before you piss him off.
l just wanted to walk him home.
You know, tough world out there.
Oh. Well, thank you
for letting me know that.
You know, l would just love to spend
my day going here and there...
with my kids instead of workin',
which is what l've been doin'
for the last 1 2 hours!
Five, six, seven, eight.
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.
One, two, three, four,
Cut.
You guys are great, though.
All right? You guys are really good.
Um, there's somethin' missing.

Fix it.
Okay.

All right.
Come on, man.
Don't be a hog, yo.
Hold that right there.
Son, take your game home.
Oh!
D. up.
What are you doing?
Gettin' you up. lt's Sunday.
So?
So? We gonna get
my birthday dress today. You forgot?
No, it's just--
l didn't get home till 6:00.
You work until 6:00 in the morning?
l hope you gettin' overtime.
- Girl, l'm dead.
- l don't care if you're cold and buried.
l got off work special for this.
So, get up! Come on. Get up!
Gina.
Oh, look. Take this.
What? What's that?
Stop.
Ay,
l love it.
What kind of money you makin'?
Oh, l didn't pay for it.
l got it for free at the shoot.
You givin' me some sweaty leftovers
instead of taking me shopping
like a real friend?
lt's not sweaty leftovers.
lt's brand-new.
lt's still got a tag on it.
Hmm.
l thought you'd like it.
Look at Miss Thing.
Too ''bougie'' to shop at the bargain stores.
lt's not even like that.
No, it's cool. lf you don't wanna go
shopping with me, l'll go by myself.
- Gina.
Oh, God.
Thank you.
Hey, Raymond. What's up?
Benny ain't been in school.
Well, where is he at?
Mama's boyfriend got
all into it with him.
Busted Benny's lip.
- Has he ever hit you?
- Not me.
Okay. Come on. Let's go find him.
Okay?
Okay.
Come on.
Hey, Benny. We've been
lookin' for you all over.
Don't. l don't need your help.
Let me handle it.
You shouldn't have to handle it.
You guys can't go back
to that apartment for a while.
We can go to my UncleJessie's.
l'll take you over there, okay?
- What do you care?
- l care because you're a good kid.
So? lt's not like you're around.
Don't even teach anymore.
Why don't you just roll out?
Huh.
Then l guess l'm just gonna have
to find someone else to help me out
with Tweet's video then.
l'm doin' the choreography
for her video next week,
and, you know, l could use
some help in the afternoons
and the evenings.
But if you don't wanna kick it,
'cause, you know--
l could come. No joke?
No joke. lf you get your butt
to school every day, yes, l promise.
Promises don't mean nothin'.
Mine do.
Set? Okay.
Five, six, seven. Fly!
One, two, three. Fly!
- Okay.
- And just work your arms, okay?
And once you land, plié.
Give a sexy pose.
Thanks, guys.
Okay. All right. Ready?
Tweet, you look great.
Thank you.
- Okay, let's try this.
- You takin' notes for me?
You're gonna get fired
if you're not takin' notes. Security.
Oh, he's just playin'.
# Now, oooh #
# l ain't gonna lie about it
Watchin' you push me in a zone about it #
#We'll leave tonight all alone
Then if it was up to me we'd get gone #
# lndeed you got the right moves #
# l can only imagine
what you really do #
# l'm feeling your body
And that's not it #
#You got me deep in a trance
so hypnotic #
# l just can't control myself #
# Baby, l now see you're hypnotic #
- # Hypnotic #
#You know you've got #
# On me #
- # Hey #
- # Hypnotic #
##
# So just keep doing it to me ##
Michael, thank you so much.
l can do that. You know l can do that.
Maybe you will someday.
Look, yo. There's people
that good things happen to.
And there's people that
good things don't happen to.
That's just the way it goes.
The gods made no mistakes
when they created their--
Fresh Air Fund kids or something?
Fresh air?
Michael, this is New York.
l, uh-- l taught them at the center.
ln fact, uh,
seeing them on the set there today
gave me an idea for Ginuwine's video.
What are you thinking?
Okay.
New York, the hood.
Ginuwine's doing his thing.
But instead of the usual hoochies,
you get a posse of kids, dancers.
They bust out, all G'd up,
just like Ginuwine--
same hair, same bling.
Like a--
- Like a hip-hop pied piper?
- Right.
l like it.
Really?
Yeah.
l'll pitch it to him.
Cool, cool.
You know, if he goes for it,
l'd like to audition my kids.
Oh, l see.
You just wanna get those
Fresh Air Fund kids into show biz.
That's not true.
Their flavor's hot. You know.
lf it gets a couple of them
off the street, so much the better.
All right, guys.
Let's do it one more time,
but clean it up. One, two,
three, four, five and six
and seven, eight.
#The things you do
when your friend's around #
# Has got me hooked on you #
##
Which one of you
can tell me who that is?
- Ginuwine.
- So which one of you
wants to audition for his video?
What video?
Open calls are in two weeks, and l'll
rehearse with anybody who's up to it.
-
All right.
#The things you do with your friends around
has got me hooked on you ##
Can l help you?
You're the dance teacher, right?
l'm Otis's brother.
You're the one his little man's
been hanging out with, right?
You mean Benny?
Yeah, Benny.
We ain't seen Benny around
in a while and we miss him.
He's been busy.
Check this out. He's part of my crew.
And when you're in my crew,
you don't mess with other shit.
So you tell him l'm looking for him.
l'm not gonna do that.
What?
Why not?
- l asked you a question!
B.B., what's poppin'?
Am l interrupting?
Well, if it ain't Floyd the Barber.
How are things in that cute
little barbershop of yours, B.?
You making ends meet?
Oh, you know.
l'm definitely doing me.
Getting this paper.
''Getting this paper.''
Check this out. When you're tired of
nickel-and-diming,just give me a holler.
l'm gonna hook you up.
Well, you ever get tired
of wearin' those bum-ass do-rags,
you give me a holler. l'll hook you up.
l wanna see that kid.
You okay?
Yeah, l'm cool.
What was that all about?
How did you get on B.B.'s bad side?
l made the wrong friend, l guess.
Well, you know,
you should stay away from him.
He's dangerous. Seriously.
Yeah. Thinking of picking up some
pepper spray tomorrow or something.
Did l say thank you?
You sure you don't want me to walk you
upstairs and make sure you're safe?
No. l can handle myself.
Thanks again.
Uh--
Bye.
Come on.
Mom, what happened?
Another pipe burst.
You can't be in here.
How long will it take to fix?
Oh, who knows?
Building codes, inspections.
Now the city wants to do a full
assessment, see if the building's
even worth reopening.
Ma, you can't let them shut you down.
your telling me what l can and cannot do
is not gonna improve my mood right now.
l don't know what to do about this.
lf there's a danger to the kids--
He's one of those kids,
you know, trying to act all bad.
But 1 0 seconds into a routine,
l catch a glimpse of him.
lt's like l can just see
this light shining out of him.
He's a kid again.
Yeah.
lt's the best feeling l know seeing that.
lt's scary though.
'Cause when l think of him hanging out
with B.B., it's like l can watch that light
get dimmer and dimmer.
Well, you know, when a thug joint's
the hottest spot in the hood,
it's hard for a kid
not to want to be down.
l know. l'm over here.
Nah, nah, nah.
l wanna show you something.
All right.
All right, sexy?
Stop with that.
Listen, this is bad date talk.
We should change the subject.
What's your favorite color?
How come you turned out so good?
She thinks l turned out good.
l'm serious.
l don't know. l got lucky.
What happened?
Well, the guy that used to own this shop
lived right next door to me and my mom.
he gave me a job here
sweeping up the floors.
lt's crazy 'cause
he couldn't even afford it.
He paid me right
out of his own pocket.
l worked for him for 1 0 years.
And when he passed,
he left this place to me.
like l'm missing something
out there on the streets,
but he and l both know who's winning.
l've found something that l truly love,
that truly makes me happy.
So, it's just someone believing in you.
Well, that and having a place to go
where l could stay out of trouble, yeah.
What?
Nothing.Just thinking.
About what?
About what makes me happy.
Well, you know, l would
really love to be a part of that.
What?
Making you happy.
will go for about $1 7 0,000.
So 1 7 down?
Seventeen thousand down, yes. ln cash.
How about l give you
half the down payment now,
and you give me 30 days
to come up with the rest?
lf l don't, you put it back
on the market.
Why do you even want this property?
lt's just an empty storefront
on a bad block.
lt's perfect for a dance studio.
Maybe even a dance school
for the whole neighborhood.
- So am l writing a check or not?
- By all means.
- Cut.
You have no idea
what this means to them.
Oh, sure, l do.
l had a first job too once.
Oh, uh, we have a meeting later.
With who?
Uh, it's, uh, the big guys.
Downtown. l'll pick you up.
We'll go together.
l can't. l'm going to Atlantic City.
No, you are not. Absolutely not.
You gotta be there, Honey.
l'm gonna pick you up around 5:00.
lt's boss man.
Well, you girls have
a good time, okay, Gina?
Who is it?
lt's Michael. Let me up.
All right. l gotta go.
You wild out.
Tear that place up. Okay.
Hey.
Hey, sweetie.
Oh, this is--
Well, this is where you live here.
What's with the threads?
Q. Walker's black-and-white party?
Yeah, that's the shit right there.
That's the biggest party of the year.
l thought we were going to a meeting.
Business and pleasure
are the same thing.
You know that, Honey.
lf l knew it was a party,
l wouldn't have canceled
on my best friend's birthday.
which will always be there,
with friends you always see,
instead of going to
the hottest party in town with me?
Look.
Everybody is gonna be there.
All right? Artists, producers,
other choreographers.
lt would be career suicide
if you didn't go.
All right. Change into that,
and, uh, l'll meet you downstairs.
Okay?
Okay.
-
Hey, uh, can l use your phone?
Yeah, yeah. Hold on.
l'm gonna go upstairs
and find a quiet room, so--
You heard her, B.
She's gonna find a quiet room upstairs.
All right. Well, uh, l miss you.
Happy birthday.
Oh. Hey, Michael.
You scared me.
- What are you doing?
- l'm just looking.
- At the house?
-
No, l'm looking at you.
That's the cognac speaking.
Here. Thanks.
You know, the first time
l ever saw you, l said to myself,
''That girl is so fine.''
Quit playin'.
Who's playing? l'm not playing.
No, seriously.
No, seriously.
Come on. Stop. Stop! Stop!
Get off of me.
Bitch, how you gonna
play me like that?
Oh. Oh, l see. l see.
You're one of those.
l'm not one of anything.
l'm just not up for this.
Professionally, yeah.
All right. That was all talk.
That was all talk, right?
Just so you could get ahead in life?
No, no, stay. Don't leave.
You made it. You're here. Stay.
Look, it's a fancy party.
You came in a fancy car.
You're drunk.
l'm gonna do you a favor.
l'm gonna pretend like
none of this happened.
- One and two, three and four.
Come on, shake it up.
Oh, oh, oh, oh!
Oh, oh, oh, oh!
Oh!
That was great.
You guys were terrific.
l'm lovin' it.
Hey, hey, yo!
Good job!
That was hot.
Where is he?
l don't know.
Ginuwine!
We're ready for a rehearsal, sir.
Hi, how you doin'?
Hold that for a while.
All right, let's see this.
All right, guys.
Just like we rehearsed.
- Five, six, seven, eight.
Cut. Cut! Cut.
Go get the car or something.
Nah, it's not--
it's not working.
Which part?
lt's horrible.
No, Michael. Don't do this.
l was thinking l wanted
to make it a little more sexy,
you know. A little more real.
What's more real than these kids?
Michael, don't do this.
lf you want to get back at me, do that,
but don't take it out on these kids.
Katrina, baby.
Hey.
- All right, now l'm gonna
give you some music.
And l want you
to listen and then move.
Got you.
Go do your thing.
Do not take away the one thing
they have to be excited about.
Look. l have a lot
to do today, all right?
So if you want to get paid,
pack up your shit and take
your little friends out of here.
l want you to fire 'em. l want you
to tell them why you're not using 'em.
What's going on?
Don't worry about it.
What makes you think
l care what you want?
- l'm so sorry.
- So it's not gonna happen?
- Why?
-Just because.
- You made him mad, didn't you?
- Not intentionally.
No, there won't. Let's go, y'all.
This is wack.
Oh, you're funny, right? Okay.
What happened
to your big dance career?
lt's weak, man.
Thug life, baby.
Yo.
That's what it is.
l like those.
Yo. Go cop those for me, man.
Let's move. Come on, go.
lf that's the girl we heard about,
then no way.
l can't get a job anywhere.
Michael's blackballing me.
You sure about that?
Yeah, and all he has to do is mention
he doesn't want me working.
What kind of clown would do that,
stop somebody from earning a living?
l guess he figures since he gave me
my career, he can take it away.
Hey. He didn't give you anything.
You get hired because you've got drive,
talent and love for what you do.
That's a gift from God,
not some video director.
The thing is,
l was counting on that money.
Not for me, for the kids.
That studio could be unbelievable.
lt could change their life.
Hmm, paying off that balance?
Actually, l came for an extension.
l need more time.
How much?
l don't know.
l sort of hit a financial snag.
Miss Daniels,
if l could help you, l would.
But l've already agreed to keep
this property off the market
for two full weeks for you.
That's the best l can do.
l know it's a lot of money.
l'm sorry, Honey.
We just don't have it.
And even if we did--
Evelyn, don't.
Even if you did what, Ma?
Honey, a commitment like that,
you take that on, you are
gonna be stuck here forever.
You'll never leave.
Oh, l forgot. l'm supposed to see
all the beautiful things in this world.
Well, there's nothing wrong
with my wanting that for you.
No, but what about what l want?
You're 22 years old.
You don't know what you want.
You know what l see
living in this neighborhood?
l see kids go from bad homes
to bad schools and back again.
And l've seen you unlock a door to
a place where those kids can feel safe.
Maybe l'm dumb because l haven't
been to Paris or Milan or wherever,
but to me,
it doesn't get much better than that.
But when l had got it,
it felt like nothing, less than nothing.
And now losing it feels even worse.
l'm not looking for sympathy.
l just need someone to talk to,
someone l know and trust.
l'm so sorry, Gina.
l totally let you down.
Do you think you could
ever trust me again?
l don't know.
You're my girl.
You know the first thing l thought
when l saw that picture in the paper?
- That hood rat lied to me.
- No, that was the second.
- That hood rat
skipped out on my birthday.
- No, that was the third.
What was the first?
That hood rat went
to the black-and-white party
and she did not bring me.
l just thought that, you know,
being your girl and all,
l'd get to go too.
You can.
No, l can't.
l'm just your friend.
You're the one with the goods.
Like l do.
Come here.
Don't worry, baby,
you'll find work real soon.
You're too good not to get hired.
All right?
l just don't have the time
to wait for people to wake up to that.
l'm gonna lose the building
at the end of the month.
lf l can't earn it, and l can't
borrow it, and l can't steal it,
l could raise it.
What do you mean?
Well, l'm trying to get
a space for kids, right?
lf people knew about it,
they'd want to help, wouldn't they?
Yeah, probably.
l could put on
a benefit performance.
Charge a cover.
Get some donated food.
Put on a great show. l could do that.
Why couldn't l do that?
'Cause l don't have a space,
that's why. Damn it!
Come here,  l got an idea.
That's love. Nah, baby,
l got you on my Christmas list.
All right? One, one.
lt's just off the B.Q. E.
lt used to be a church.
The cat l was just on the phone with,
he used to own it.
But in three weeks they're converting it
to office space, so it's empty now.
lf you want it, you better jump on it.
What's it like?
lt's dirty. lt's old.
But it has a floor, right?
Yeah.
l'll take it. Thank you.
Hey, guys.
Hi, Honey. What's up?
l know what you're thinking,
''What the hell we doing here?''
Don't worry, it's temporary.
This is what we call a means to an end.
Nobody's gonna give us a space,
that much is clear.
So we're gonna raise the money
and buy it, straight up and legal.
Y'all ever heard of a benefit performance?
- What do you mean? LikeJerry Lewis?
l'm Jerry. You're the kids.
Let's get to work.
Orange. Good color for you.
That's right.
When you do,
l want you to come hang with me.
Nah.
You could have a good life, Benny.
lt doesn't have to be like this.
What do you know?
You ain't got no job.
You ain't got no money.
- Matter of fact, you ain't got nothing.
- What l got is a clear conscience.
Yeah? What you gonna buy with that?
lt breaks my heart seeing you
selling yourself short like this.
So leave. Get.
Let me ask you something.
You know your homies,
those guys that got your back?
- Yeah?
- How many times they come to visit you?
You think about that.
l don't know
if this is gonna work, Missy.
But, uh, nah, Katrina's gonna make this
so sexy, it's not gonna matter.
Katrina?
Who the hell is Katrina?
- That's Katrina.
- Hey.
Katrina is the shit.
She just did Ginuwine's new video.
l don't care if she just showed
MichaelJackson how to Harlem shake.
l said l want Honey.
Honey Daniels. Duh.
lf not, then we fix it.
So there's no problem.
Let me see what you got.
What you gonna do?
l was thinking something a little more
sexy, maybe in the hips. Lenny.
- No. No, no, no.
What is this, this?
##
Look, let me tell you something.
l don't backup dance for Heather Hunter.
l don't know what kind of
pornography y'all got going on here.
This has gotta be a joke.
Anyway, when you get in touch
with Honey Daniels, you call me.
You, you need to call M.C. Hammer,
let him know you're stealing his stuff.
Missy, hold up. l got an idea.
Honey, what you been up to?
Bye, Michael.
Wait, come on.
Honey, come on.
Hold on. l came to apologize.
l'm not interested.
Give me a break.
What l did,
the way l handled things
was uncool, and l am so sorry.
Hey, and l want
to make it up to you.
ls that so?
l've got you three new jobs.
And you want me to do the choreography?
l am begging you.
Oh, l get it.
The artist asked for me, and
if you don't deliver, they're walkin'.
Am l right?
They want you, sure.
But so do l.
Michael, you got yourself
in such a bind.
Good luck getting out of it.
l'll pay. You know l got the money.
l don't want your money.
Are you sure?
You sure about that?
Because, uh, l could buy you
a little dance studio.
What about that? What about
you come back to work for me,
and l'll get you this.
You know what's funny?
When l first met you,
you were 1 0 feet tall.
And now l look at you,
you're this big.
l don't need your help. l'm gonna get
that dance studio on my own.
Hey.
- So you came.
- l had to.
l can't let these bustas get
in front of an audience doin' no--
- That's wack.
- ls that so?
- Let's see you bust.
- Let's do this.
Five, six, seven, eight.
So you pick that up in juvie?
That's right. l believe in making
every experience educational.
All right, guys, let's clump it up.
We only got a few rehearsal days left.
Let's make it count.
Music.
Okay.
- ##
- Count 'em in.
Five, six. Five, six, seven, eight.
Good.
Nice.
One more time.
Keep it tight, okay?
Hey,
Gina.
Oh, you know my homegirl
Mrs. Strom, right?
Your friend came by the bank and
told me what you're trying to do here.
l do banking for some
nonprofit arts foundations.
- l know some people.
- Some rich people.
Some people who would find
the opportunity of funding
a project like yours very interesting.
Are you serious?
l've invited them tonight.
Oh, my goodness.
Thank you so much.
Don't thank me yet.Just go out
there and put on a good show.
How am l supposed to know
if l'm dressed right if you won't
tell me where we're going?
What you're wearing is fine.
Are you sure?
l'm sure we're late.
Where are we going?
l'm not telling.
You better tell me something.
l'm not telling.
Here you go.
Does the set look okay?
Yeah, it's cool.
l don't know. l feel like
l should've had brighter lights,
or a different backdrop, or colors.
l don't know. Here.
Yo, Honey. lt's good.
Just chill out. We got your back.
Now get out of here.
We got a show to do.
Wow.
You have no idea
how beautiful y'all look.
This means a lot to me.
This means a lot to all of us.
These kids are good kids,
and, man, do they love to dance.
Dancing isn't what they do,
it's who they are.
And you coming here tonight
says you wanna get to know 'em.
That means more
than you could imagine.
Peace.
That was beautiful, baby.
Beautiful.
Encore, encore!
- Beautiful, beautiful.
- Come on.
Honey, Honey, Honey!
You big dummy,
how the hell y'all don't know
how to get to the B.Q. E.?
Let me explain something to you.
lf you make me miss my hookup
with Miss Honey Daniels,
l'm gonna straight barbecue
your Big Bird-lookin',
wannabe,
ass.
What's up, girl?
Hey, Missy.
Man, good to see you.
You too.
Honey, this is Blaque right here.
And Blaque, this is Honey Daniels.
They got a video coming up,
so they'll need some hot stuff.
Some ''oom-pah-pay,'' you know.
- Come on, girls.
l heard your record's hot.
- Thanks.
Right leg first, okay?
Seven, eight.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three and four.
Five, six.
