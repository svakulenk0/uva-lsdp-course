I have dogs bigger than that.
I thought you said
there were panthers here.
I ain't seen a panther
in these mountains for nine years.
Then what about the carcass
Snipes found up in Noland?
- Something mauled that.
- That weren't no panther.
The chest weren't tore open.
They eat the heart first.
You find me an honest-to-God panther
to hunt
and I'll give you a $20 gold piece.
If there's a panther still around,
it's likely touched by the devil.
May end up hunting you.
Well, I want one.
Vaughn. Would you have the girl
bring me my meal?
Coming down!
Stand clear!
Timber!
George!
All right, bring her around.
Albert! What are you doing out here?
Well, a letter came from the bank.
Oh, it's nothing to worry about.
Look, you're going to have to
renegotiate the loan.
I'll go up to Boston next week
and settle it. Don't fret.
Get it up! Come on.
- My uncle's a partner. Don't forget.
- That's right but still.
See, if we go up the north ridge
and we carry it all the way down...
Get it off!
Get it off! Get it off! Get it off!
Rumour has it that Congress is creating
a national park in Carolina.
Well, the park may come.
By the time the government takes
the land,
there won't be a tree standing.
The trouble is, George,
with this recent market crash,
I'm afraid your stocks are no longer
sufficient collateral
for us to roll a loan over.
I mean, all my capital
is wrapped up in Carolina.
What about this land in Brazil?
I'd rather not touch that.
You should have married Peg Lowell
when you had the chance.
Then you wouldn't have to bow
and scrape for your bankers.
Well, you're up on the news, aren't you?
I am. That's why you should
talk to your sister more often.
- I came to visit you this week.
- Once.
In how long?
I don't know what you're doing
tearing down that mountain,
God knows where, and for what?
Why can't you ever do anything sensible?
I'm doing quite well, thank you.
- Will there be anything else?
- No, thank you.
That woman you're slavering over
is practically an aborigine, you know.
Raised on a timber camp.
A timber camp?
Yes, I thought you'd like that.
Unfortunately, it burned down
and killed her whole family.
And two days after the fire,
a rescue party found Serena
wandering in the ruins,
calling for her dead brothers
and sisters.
She was so covered in ash,
they thought she was a ghost.
She is beautiful.
Wounded.
Mad for trees.
Hmm.
It's a pity you don't stand a chance
with her.
What are you doing?
- I just wanted to say hello.
-  Well, hello.
George Pemberton.
Serena Shaw.
I think we should be married.
I can't wait to get there.
Oh! Welcome back!
- Splendid trip.
- Good!
- I can't wait to fill you in.
- Yeah.
I hope you didn't get all dolled up
on my account.
Oh, no, no.
- Hello.
-  Hello.
What...
Well, what do you think of my wife?
What? Why didn't you tell me?
I, you know...
- Jesus, George! Why didn't you tell me?
-
I would have, you know...
This is Buchanan.
He's my right-hand man.
- Serena Pemberton.
- Oh.
Don't you know how to shake hands
properly, Mr. Buchanan?
Well, of course I do.
I'm very happy to meet you.
And, uh, well, welcome!
So did Galloway find my panther yet?
Well, a worker found some tracks
up on Laurel Creek
but Galloway thinks that was a bobcat.
- Are panthers common here?
- No, no, nothing to worry about.
I mean, there's some question
as to whether there are any left at all.
I was hoping to see my new home
before it gets dark.
Yes, of course.
- That girl...
- It doesn't matter.
Our love began the day we met.
Nothing that happened before
even exists.
Keep your eyes closed.
- Give me your hand.
Step down. Watch your head.
One more. One more.
Okay. Okay. Wait.
On three, you can open your eyes.
One, two, three.
That's beautiful, George.
And that's just the start.
I bought an amazing property in Brazil.
- Brazil?
- Yes.
Virgin forest for hundreds of miles.
Mahogany.
Raw and beautiful.
Completely untouched.
Can't find something like that
in America.
You want that, don't you?
More than anything.
I never thought I'd find you.
I never thought I'd find anyone.
Really. You have no idea.
Doc! Doc!
Come on.
Chaney!
Got ourselves another one.
Ah, you're too late. There's nothing
I can do. Put him in the chair.
Rattlesnake?
Yeah,
it's gotten worse since you left.
The crews get spooked and fall behind.
We've lost six men
in the last two months.
Shit.
In Colorado, we had a trained eagle
to keep the snakes under control.
Right. Well, I don't think
you'll find any eagles in Carolina,
Mrs. Pemberton.
Well, we should import one.
Yeah, of course.
Yeah, we should import one. Why not?
So I understand you have
some experience in the lumber
business, Mrs. Pemberton?
My father had 40,000 acres in Colorado.
Had?
I do hope he didn't lose them
in this awful crash.
He died.
Her father was
a first-rate timber man, Dr. Chaney.
He had her riding the slope
before she could walk.
Well, that gives you
the advantage over us, Mrs. Pemberton.
I sure would like to
know what you think
of our little operation here.
Aside from our obvious lack
of an eagle, that is.
I think you've taken nine months
to do about six months' work.
But a few changes should greatly
increase profitability.
What did you find, a wife or a partner?
Both.
I suppose Mrs. Buchanan
takes no interest in your work?
Oh, I'm a bachelor.
I can assure you, Mr. Buchanan,
I didn't come to Carolina
to do needlepoint.
Of course not.
She is a pistol.
Buchanan's a funny one, isn't he?
He seems a little bit, I don't know,
too fond of you.
What do you mean?
He'll loosen up.
Yeah.
- Good morning.
-  Good morning.
Mrs. Pemberton's father owned
the Vulcan Lumber Company in Colorado.
And she's equal to any man here.
I expect you to follow her orders
the same way you follow mine
or Mr. Campbell or Mr. Buchanan's.
And she'll take no quarter
and she'll expect none.
You'll soon see the truth of that.
Good day.
- Good morning.
-  Good morning.
Come on, now.
Let's get to it.
The trees ain't gonna
cut themselves, boys.
- Mrs. Pemberton.
- Campbell.
How's everything going?
Well, good as can be expected, ma'am.
Don't notch so high!
You're wasting a foot of timber.
Any lower won't fall clear, ma'am.
Yonder's in the way.
Give me your axe.
- Ma'am?
- You heard me.
- It'll clear.
- Ma'am.
What do you think?
She'll clear.
Get back to work.
Who's that man up there?
His name is Galloway, ma'am.
- He seems standoffish.
- He is.
He's the best hunting guide
in over a hundred miles.
Track a grasshopper on a cap rock.
He say he has a gift of visioning.
Whatever that is, I don't know.
Mr. Galloway.
Serena Pemberton.
You were in prison.
Why?
Manslaughter.
He had it coming.
Stand back, now.
Timber!
Tree down!
Our Smoky Mountains contain
the last virgin forests
But with every passing year,
we're losing 'em
to the cut-and-run philosophy
of the logging barons.
But we're fools if we think
that what God has created
can be sacrificed for a quick profit.
The simple question before us is this,
ladies and gentlemen.
Do we want our Smoky Mountains
to be made a national park?
Or do we want them to be made a desert?
Thank you, Mr. Kephart.
And thank you all for
showing up this afternoon.
-  What about the jobs, Sheriff?
-
These men need to work, don't they?
And the logging camps bring
in railroads and electric lines
to places that never had them before.
We're bringing progress to Carolina.
Progress? Progress for whom,
Mr. Pemberton?
All the profits are going north.
Well, what is it
that your park's providing?
I'm sure your park
will be very nice for you
and your rich friends to go
on a Sunday afternoon hike
but for the working men,
the men in this room, Sheriff,
the men unlike you, Mr. Kephart,
it's a matter of survival.
He's right, Sheriff.
The logging barons always cry "jobs"
and "free enterprise"
but the truth is,
you barely pay enough
to put food on the table.
Oh, we pay more than
any job these men can get.
And that's why there's a line 50-deep
every time there's an opening.
Openings. Yes, you always have openings,
don't you, Mr. Pemberton?
Because your camps
have killed more men than
the War Between the States.
It's dangerous work.
And every logger will tell you
he's proud of what he does.
And I don't think he wants
the government
to build him a pretty park, Sheriff.
I think he wants the freedom.
The freedom to work hard
and to better himself.
That's what this country
is supposed to be about, Sheriff!
Yeah! That's right!
Yeah! Yeah!
- You did wonderfully.
- Just told the truth.
One, two, three, smile! And flash!
I love you so much.
I have your child inside me.
- Namaste.
- Namaste.
Vaughn!
Put my horse in the stable.
They need to get used to each other.
Yes, ma'am.
- I'll get you some food and blankets.
- Don't bother.
I won't eat or sleep until she does.
- Well, I'm staying here with you.
- No, you're not.
I need to do this alone.
They need to know that it was a woman
who tamed the eagle.
All right. Everybody out.
Hi.
The prey believes that
if it keeps still, it won't be noticed.
But eventually it flinches.
And when it does,
the eagle always sees.
This, uh, park business
seems to be picking up speed.
Now that Rockefeller's
thrown in with them,
they're making real offers.
- They'll be coming to us next?
- Yeah.
Rockefeller's $5 million behind them.
We're not interested.
Well, I was asking your husband's
opinion, Mrs. Pemberton, not yours.
Easy.
Well, I don't want you
to worry about it.
Well, I do.
We'll need about a million
to pay off the loan
and have enough money
to get going in Brazil.
That's two more years here in Carolina,
assuming this park business
doesn't shut  down.
We're going to have to
pay off a senator.
Listen. What do you think of Serena?
Oh, well, she's a lovely girl.
I'm sorry. I should have
said something to you earlier.
But Serena is different, you know.
She'd rather come to a godforsaken place
like Carolina
than sip tea with society ladies.
Can you imagine a woman like that?
Well, I don't have to imagine her,
George. She's right here with us.
I just don't want you to think of her
as my wife.
I want you to think of her as a partner.
Because she is.
A partner.
- Every cent she has, she gave to us.
- Right.
Well, I will indeed. A partner.
- Good morning, Sheriff.
- Ladies.
So, this is for you, Senator.
- You have a nice campaign, now.
- I will.
Good day, Mr. Buchanan.
Does Mr Pemberton think bribes
can stop the park?
Oh, well, nothing wrong
with having friends in high places.
I'm surprised Mrs. Pemberton
isn't handling the bribery by now.
I hear she's taken charge
of everything else at the camp.
I understand why
you might think so, Sheriff.
But you don't really know.
We'd like to make you a proposition.
- Sheriff McDowell.
- Buchanan.
-  Welcome. How are you today?
- Good. Thank you.
Good. Good to see you.
Mr. Kephart.
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you, too.
- How are you?
- All right.
They seem chummy.
Has Buchanan ever done business
for them before?
Not that I know of.
This is your offer, then?
$400,000.
That's a good deal more
than you'd get on the open
market, Mr. Pemberton.
Well, maybe that's true, Mr Kephart.
But we're asking
for a million dollars firm, so...
The land was appraised at 300.
Before the crash.
Well, I am very sorry
to have wasted your time today,
gentlemen but, um,
we were all under the assumption
that you were coming to us
with a formidable offer.
If we have to take this land
by eminent domain,
you'll be lucky to get a half
of what we're offering.
- Is that a threat, Sheriff?
- No, no, it's a fact.
Gentlemen, gentlemen, uh,
why don't we all, um,
reconsider our positions
and convene whenever
the Pembertons
and I have looked through...
The fact is, Sheriff,
you need our land to build your park.
And our price is a million dollars.
Well, think a second time.
Because one false step
and those bankers you're in hock to
will be picking on the bones
of your fortune.
And I personally would hate to see
your pretty wife humiliated in that way.
You don't ever get to talk about wife,
let alone look at her.
You can leave now.
Good day. Good day, ma'am.
- How are you, Mr. Galloway?
- Well, Mr. Pemberton.
I thought you were coming with us?
Galloway's got a line on a panther.
Oh. I'm afraid not.
I've got business in Asheville.
- On a Sunday?
- Yeah, I'm afraid so.
Bobcat.
But, um, that ain't what you want,
is it, Mr. Pemberton?
No, it's not.
Next time, we come at nightfall.
If there's a panther roundabout,
you'll hear it.
You know that, uh,
that park agitator, Kephart?
He has a cabin here.
Do you know where that is?
I reckon I do.
I'd like to take a look.
I went by Kephart's cabin.
I, uh... Yeah, I've been negotiating
with them.
- Behind my back.
- Yeah. Well, look. Listen.
Listen, they'll go  high as 450 now.
You said a million.
That's what you always said.
George, you're going to have to forget
about Brazil.
That's...
You're not the same any more.
The only thing that's changed is you.
Look. I just want out.
I'll buy you out
soon as we move to Brazil.
Oh, I'm afraid I can't wait that long.
Well, I'm not going to sell, Albert,
so you can't do anything about it.
That's the agreement, till I sell.
You know what?
I'll tell them about the bribes.
- Go ahead. You're as guilty as I am.
- No.
You're going to take the fall, George.
I get a deal if I testify.
I've had that arranged.
You're going to go to prison.
That's what's going to happen.
You're a son of a bitch.
It's so obvious now. My friend?
He was never my friend.
He'd come here and threaten me
in my home?
What we've built?
What I promised you, Serena?
What I've promised you!
How did we lose Brazil, George?
I don't understand.
Well, I had to put the land up
as collateral,
otherwise the bank wouldn't
roll over the loan.
Because that's what he's doing.
He's going to make us sell
and we're going to lose it, Serena,
everything.
Our future.
Everything that we talked about.
Why didn't you tell me about the land?
Well, I didn't think
that it would matter.
How was I supposed to
know that he was doing back-door
deals with Kephart?
We promised
to tell each other everything.
- I didn't want to frighten you.
- I'm not that kind of woman.
The only thing that frightens me
is the thought that you don't trust me.
I'm sorry.
I told you what he was
on the first night, George.
He's jealous of me.
He's trying to destroy what we have.
Well, we're running out of time.
He said he's already
making up the paperwork.
Then we have a real problem.
I go to prison, it'll be over for us.
Then solve it.
He betrayed you, George.
He was never your friend.
Keep the horses back,
Campbell.
You hear me, boys?
Let Mr. Pemberton and Mr. Buchanan
set up on the orchard.
Come on. Get! Come on, now.
The bear's hunkered down
in them trees, Mr. Pemberton.
- Dogs will flush him out in no time.
- Thanks, Mr. Galloway.
Get, get! Come on.
Go get him. Come on.
Did Serena
take the news well?
Yeah, well, she's handled worse
than this, hasn't she?
Keeps her pride.
No matter what other people say.
Well, did you see that?
What...
Help!
Come on! Help me get him!
We need help over here!
We got a man down!
-  Chaney...
- One shot. Rifle.
Sheriff.
We were set up on the same line
and the bear had come in between us
and by the time it had crossed through,
he was in my crosshairs.
Anyone with you?
No.
You see anything, Campbell?
No, I didn't see nothing, Sheriff.
Well, looks like your shot hit
dead centre of his heart.
Pretty amazing accident.
You and Buchanan got on, did you?
He was my best friend.
Take the body downtown.
I'm going to have an autopsy done.
You got anything to add?
It was an accident.
How do you know that?
He ain't a good enough shot
to do it on purpose.
Anything else, Sheriff?
Not today, Mr. Pemberton.
Not today.
I had decided not to...
But then he turned around.
I wish I could have been beside you.
He was never your friend.
He betrayed you, George.
You don't understand.
Everything you did, you did for us.
For our future.
Come in.
- Uh, Mr. Buchanan's things.
- Ah.
The coroner agreed it was an accident.
Wrote it in the report.
I love you so much.
Thank you, sir.
Oh! Come on.
Four. So, 41.
Does my scar bother you?
Of course not.
Whatever happened in that fire?
I was 12.
I used to sleep downstairs
because I would wake up early
to take care of the horses.
And I didn't want
to wake the little ones.
That's how I got out in time.
I knew they were still inside.
But I just kept running.
And I kept going until
I couldn't hear them
screaming any more.
I was the oldest.
They were screaming for me.
You were only a child.
After that day, I swore that
I would never love
anyone ever again.
I can't lose you.
You won't.
Ever.
What is it?
Rachel Hermann has come.
She's looking for her old job back.
Well, where is she?
Over in the chapel.
But there ain't no work in this town,
not for a young lady of her kind.
Widow Jenkins is kind of looking after
that boy of hers.
If she don't get a job,
her and that boy will starve.
We both know it wasn't
her fault that she got pregnant
out of wedlock, now.
So you want your old job back?
Yes, sir.
- Well, you can start Monday.
- Yes, sir.
The, uh, child. What's the child's name?
Jacob. That's from the Bible.
That's a beautiful name.
Thank you.
Monday.
She knows that
she has no claim on us,
of course? Nor her child.
No, she knows that, of course.
Campbell just said that
there's no work in town
and I don't want to let them starve.
Does she intend to bring the child
to work with her?
No, there's an old widow
that's going to take care of him.
Him.
- So it's a boy.
- Apparently.
Look, it doesn't make
one difference to me.
It's just I don't want them to struggle,
that's all.
Nor do I.
All right, boys.
Break's over!
Give me that.
Sorry.
Get his chin up.
Smile for me, Jacob.
Big smile, now.
That's it. Look at the birdie.
And, uh, hold it there now.
Can you get... Just raise him up
just a little bit higher, please?
That's good. That's good.
Just hold him there, now.
Okay. Jacob!
- Come on, now.
-  Come on, now.
Just look at me.
Look at me please, Jacob. There you go.
Smile for me, now! Smile!
- And flash!
-
Hold him still, miss.
Look at the birdie!
And flash!
- You okay?
- Yes.
Come feel.
He's moving.
Right here.
Oh. Yeah.
The first of our dozen.
- You want me to take that?
- No, no, no!
I got it, Mr. Vaughn. Thank you.
It's perfect, George. He'll love it.
- How do you know it's a boy?
- I just do.
Well, maybe I'd like a girl.
No. You're not getting one.
- Is that right?
- Mmm-hmm.
Thank you.
-
-  Over here!
Pick it up, now.
This one here.
Somebody give me a belt!
Give me your belt!
It's okay.
It's okay.
Get him on the car.
Campbell!
Chaney!
Load him up in the truck!
Campbell, go with him.
Get him in the van.
Come on, get in the truck.
Turn him around. Come on. I got him!
I'll live.
It's done been prophesied.
Damn fine job,
whoever tied that tourniquet.
He would have bled out otherwise.
Did you do that?
Yes.
- Were you riding a horse?
- Uh-huh.
Most likely something hasn't
lain right on your stomach.
It really does not feel
like a stomach-ache.
Well, it certainly isn't labour.
Now, the hospital at Asheville
can give you a second opinion,
if the discomfort is too much for you.
Well, let's go there, then.
- Mmm-hmm. All right.
-  Bye.
get the doctor.
- No, George. George.
I just want to try
to go to sleep.
All right.
You sure you don't want to
go to the hospital?
Yeah.
I'll feel better in the morning.
I love you.
I love you, too.
Campbell!
Campbell!
-
- Oh, God.
- She's going to need more blood.
-  Use mine.
It's going to be okay.
You're going to be fine.
The child is dead?
Yes.
A boy?
What?
What?
We won't be able to have another.
Take a warm bath
and I'll get the rest of the things.
- Get rid of it!
- What? What?
- Get rid of it! Get rid of it now!
- Okay, I'll...
I need to see your missus.
Well, she's resting now.
I can wait.
What for?
The day I was born, my mama had a vision
that I would lose much
but be saved by a woman.
Your missus
the one from that prophecy.
And I'm honour-bound to her.
Mr. Pemberton!
What is it?
We're about to leave.
Uh, payday.
Need you to come open the safe.
Here, you do it.
- Don't forget to bring the key back.
- Thank you.
Watch your head.
Okay.
You'll have to testify to what you saw.
And what you did.
I can't promise you won't do time.
Don't have to.
I fully understand the consequences
of my actions.
There's a judge in Raleigh
you can show these to.
One they don't own yet.
You sure you still want to
go through with this?
You want me to take 'em?
You look stunning.
Thank you.
Everything's going to be all right.
I know.
We're going to go downstairs
and we're going to
eat and dance and...
We're going to forget about
everything but each other.
- I won't be long.
- Okay.
What level of investment
do you require?
What's this, George?
This is my lovely wife.
This is Mr. Lowenstein.
The woman who tames eagles.
- Your reputation precedes you.
-
Now, this is Mr. Calhoun.
These two gentlemen are...
Serena.
I want to dance.
These gentlemen are interested
in investing in Brazil.
But I love this song
and I really want to dance.
I think you should sit down.
- Will you dance with me, Mr. Lowenstein?
- No, that's not a good idea.
- Don't...
- Well, uh...
Of course, I'd be delighted to,
Mrs. Pemberton.
But I...
It's fine. Fine.
Thank you.
My husband is apparently
too busy to dance with me.
Campbell's gone missing.
You might want to check the safe.
He took the ledgers.
He can destroy us, George.
Just like Buchanan.
Hmm?
Hmm?
Your daddy is a loving working man...
I know where Campbell is.
Good.
Locking yourself in?
I saw some tracks by the falls.
Looks like a panther.
Let me know when you want to kill it.
Mr. Campbell?
Get out!
Get out!
Vaughn?
Mr. Pemberton's going
to be very hungry
when he gets home.
Have cook make up all of his favourites
and bring them to the cabin
when he gets back.
Yes, ma'am.
Here's your supper.
I have some business to go take care of.
I'm doing this for us, George.
For our new world.
What are you talking about?
Brazil, of course.
We're going to be so happy there.
Give me the Sheriff. Quick!
Rachel stays with
the widow Jenkins sometimes.
It ain't far.
Mrs. Jenkins?
It's Sheriff McDowell.
Mrs. Jenkins?
We gotta get you out of here.
Is she all right?
- Mrs. Sloan.
- Come on in. Come on.
What can I do for you, Sheriff?
There was a murder
up on Colt Ridge last night.
Widow named Jenkins.
Never hurt a soul.
Somebody slashed her throat.
And, uh...
why are you telling me?
I'd like to speak to your wife,
if you don't mind.
My wife?
She's not in there.
She went out with the cutting crew
earlier this morning.
That's convenient.
You happen to know
where she and that mongrel of
hers were last night?
I know she had nothing to do
with some old woman's murder.
Well, that woman was looking
after Rachel Hermann's boy.
Is the child all right?
Ask your wife.
I don't need to.
You make no mistake.
They were coming for your boy.
Galloway slit Campbell's throat
the other day.
Your boy was next.
Expect your wife
can tell you why,
Mr. Pemberton.
Tell me you didn't do it.
Tell me you didn't send Galloway.
It's okay, George.
It's okay.
It had to be done.
For us.
What had to be done?
You hurt me.
You said that
I was enough for you.
You are enough for me.
You're lying.
I found the picture of your baby.
Our love is more important
than that child, isn't it?
Isn't it, George?
You just tell me where Galloway is.
- Just tell me where he is.
- No, come on. No...
- It'll all be over.
- No.
- Just tell me. Just...
- No.
It'll never be over
as long as that child is alive.
No, please... No...
You'll never be free of him.
Can't you see?
He looks just like you.
I had to.
Just let the child go!
George. Stop.
George!
If you love your bastard child
as much, then just kill me.
That's the only way you'll ever stop me.
Where did you send Rachel and the boy?
That's a matter for the law.
This is everything you need
to put me away forever.
And what's that supposed to mean?
It means that I'm turning myself in.
You just tell me where they are
and when I get back,
you'll have your arrest.
I don't need your help.
Do you know that Galloway never
came back to the camp last night?
I'll contact Rachel.
Tell her to move on.
He is going to find them, Sheriff.
You know that  well as I do.
And what do you propose
to do about that?
Tell me where they are.
That's my boy, Sheriff.
-  So you'll be fine?
- Mmm.
I'll be back soon.
Bye-bye.
Bye.
Kingsport, Tennessee. Name of Sloan.
You got 24 hours,
then I'm calling the judge.
I need the next train to Washington.
There ain't one for another two hours.
- There anything sooner?
- No.
-
-
-
- Shh, shh. Hush.
Shh.
Hush...
Please, no.
Mr. Galloway...
Stop.
It's okay.
- You say he'll be hunting?
- Yes, sir.
- Up in Noland.
- Hmm.
Let's go.
I told him if he's real quiet,
Joel'll give him some
more cars for his choo-choo
when we get there.
Joel Vaughn?
Yeah.
He's going to take care of us now.
Jacob's real sweet on him.
You best say goodbye to him now.
Spread out, boys.
There, there.
All right. All right, come on.
Son of a bitch.
Mrs. Pemberton!
-
- Mrs. Pemberton?
You need to come and identify.
Mrs. Pemberton?
Mrs. Pemberton?
Mrs. Pemberton, you need to come out
and identify your next of kin.
All right. Let's take him away, then.
Come on, boys,
let's get back in the car.
