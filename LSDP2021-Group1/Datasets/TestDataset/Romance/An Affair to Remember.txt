MAN:
Our love affair
Is a wondrous thing
That we'll rejoice
In remembering
Our love was born
With our first embrace
And a page was torn
Out of time and space
Our love affair
May it always be
A flame to burn
Through eternity
So take my hand
With a fervent prayer
That we may live
And we may share
A love affair
To remember
And so,
while the New York
Stock Exchange
showed signs
of restlessness,
there was little
or no uneasiness
on the part of optimists.
Here's good news
for you bachelors.
Competition
for pretty girls
will definitely
be easier
now that Nickie Ferrante,
the big dame hunter,
is going out
of circulation.
Yes, it'll be wedding bells
for him at long last.
Mr. Ferrante is
sailing today from Europe
and Miss Lois Clark
will be waiting for him
at the gangplank
in New York.
Lois and her lovely
What a deal!
Not only all that lettuce,
but a beautiful tomato, too.
Wow.
Mmm. Here's rather
a choice little tidbit,
Nickie Ferrante sails tonight
to enter into matrimony
with one of America's
industrial nobility.
Rock and gravel,
I believe.
It's a Miss Lois...
Clark.
Yes.
Well...
Well, there you have it.
Signor Ferrante?
No, no.
Signor Ferrante?
Is he on board?
Yes. Signor Ferrante!
Signor Ferrante.
Signor Ferrante.
Signor Ferrante?
Boy, here I am.
Are you
Signor Ferrante?
I have a telephone call
for you from Paris.
Mr. Ferrante,
would you autograph this...
That's very kind,
but I'm wanted
on the telephone.
Thank you.
Hello?
Yes, this is Ferrante.
Who's calling?
Oh, put her on.
You beast.
Hello, Gabriella.
"Hello, Gabriella."
Don't you talk to me.
"Don't talk..."
then why did
you call me?
How could you
speak of love to me,
say the things you did?
And you,
about to be married!
You remember
what you whispered
when I gave you
the cigarette case?
Well, of course, dear.
I said... I said...
Hello! Hello!
Can you hear me,
Gabriella?
I believe
we're disconnected.
We are not
disconnected!
Operator! Operator!
Oh, this is a shame.
Operator!
Hypocrite!
I have in my hand a knife
and I wish it were
in your back.
Mmm.
Well! Mr. Ferrante.
My name's Hathaway,
Ned Hathaway.
Really?
Welcome aboard.
I was wondering
if you'd care
to join my wife,
my sister and me
in a game of bridge.
Oh, I'm sorry,
Mr. Hathaway,
but I cheat.
It's an addiction.
I beg your pardon.
I think you have
my cigarette case.
I might as well confess.
I am a jewel thief.
I don't believe it.
I was returning it
to the purser.
I found it in the... Ah.
Just a moment.
How do I know
it's yours?
Well,
there's an inscription
to me on the inside.
Oh.
"To Nicolo."
Oh.
Don't tell me
you're the famous...
Oh, I have read
so much about you
in Life and Look and...
Possibly Good Housekeeping?
Now, may I have my case?
No, no.
Just a moment.
Hmm.
Whew!
This is frightfully
intimate.
I know just enough French
to be embarrassed.
Could you
refine it a little
and tell me in effect
what it says?
Well, in effect,
it says,
"In memory of three
unforgettable nights
aboard La Gabriella,"
which is her yacht.
Oh.
I guess that's you,
all right.
Tell me,
did you write the song,
"I'll Never Smile Again?"
No.
But I'm thinking of
writing one called
"Moon Over La Gabriella."
Do you think it will
ever take the place
of night baseball?
Please, wait.
I'm in trouble,
serious trouble.
Well, I could've
told you.
Playing around yachts.
The poor thing.
I must talk
with someone.
Well, I'm not very good
at that sort of thing.
I talk a lot.
I've tried
to break myself
of the habit, but...
But you have
such an honest face.
I have?
I can trust you,
can't I?
Yes, I suppose so.
Good.
Come with me.
Yes, but the captain
has an honest face, too.
Why can't you tell
him your troubles?
Shall we go
to your cabin,
or to mine?
Ah, no, mine.
But mine is
just around the...
Mine is here.
It's not that
I'm prudish,
but my mother
told me never
to enter
a man's room
in months ending
in "R."
She did?
Ah.
Oh, well, your mother's
not only beautiful,
she's clever, too.
What is your name?
Terry McKay.
Terry McKay and
I'm traveling alone.
Was that, by any chance,
what was troubling you?
Yes.
May I?
You may.
Thank you.
Um... I think you can
leave it here.
Oh, you know,
this couldn't be nicer.
You saved my life.
I was bored to death.
I hadn't seen one
attractive woman on
this ship since we left.
Now, isn't that terrible?
I was alarmed.
I said to myself,
"Don't beautiful women
travel anymore?"
And then I saw you,
and I was saved, I hope.
Tell me, have you
been getting results
with a line like that?
Or would I
be surprised?
If you were surprised,
I'd be surprised.
That sounds
like a nasty crack.
I could make a few,
too, if I wanted to.
I'm sure you could.
I know I can.
That's what I said.
All right.
I think I will.
I'm listening.
Does your fiancée know
the lady of the yacht...
Gabriella?
Gabriella.
Why certainly.
She's her best friend.
Chummy little group.
You know, this ship
is going much too fast.
We ought
to take advantage
of every moment.
Don't you think
that life should be
gay and bright
and bubbly
like champagne?
I like pink champagne.
Yes, that's
the kind I mean,
pink champagne.
Is there any reason
why from now on
this trip shouldn't
be pink champagne?
Mmm-hmm.
What?
Oh, dear.
He wouldn't like it?
No.
Husband?
No.
He still
wouldn't like it?
No.
Why isn't he
traveling with you?
Because he had
to go to Texas
on a big merger.
Ah.
He thought it'd
be a good idea
if I took a little trip
while he consummated
this big deal
because I have no
head for business.
It's beyond me
how the more money
a corporation loses,
the more money
it makes,
because of
the carryovers
with the write-offs.
The big secret
seems to be
to merge
a sick corporation
with a big,
fat, healthy one
and then everybody
gets well.
Silly, isn't it?
He doesn't think
I'm dumb,
but he doesn't think
I'm very bright
about things like that.
Well, it isn't
necessary, is it?
Thank you.
That's all right.
Well, so he trusts you?
Implicitly.
No mistakes,
no errors,
no tiny
little slips?
Five faithful years.
Ah.
Sounds awful,
doesn't it,
but it's true.
Yes.
Well, there you are.
Cigarette?
No, thank you.
Oh, I don't...
You could light it
from that inscription,
couldn't you?
Oh. Oh, I like that.
I must stay tuned
into you.
Yes. He's a very
lucky fellow.
Must be
a remarkable man.
Well, you can imagine
how attractive he is
when I can resist
so charming a person
as...
Yes. Yes.
I understand.
Well, it was nice,
wasn't it?
Oh, well.
Well, there's still
deck tennis,
shuffleboard, bingo.
Well, don't tell me
you're embarrassed.
Yes. Yes, as a matter
of fact, I am.
Oh, I am sorry.
It's all right.
Don't apologize.
I do hope
it won't affect
your ego because...
No, please.
Please, don't think
anything of it.
I'll just take
my ego for a walk.
Unless, of course,
you'd care to...
Have dinner
with you?
Mmm.
I'd love to.
Here comes
my friend Ferrante now.
Oh, Mr. Ferrante,
I'd like to have you meet
my sister, Miss Hathaway
and my wife,
Mrs. Hathaway...
And when
you were little,
what did your nurse
read to you at bedtime?
Let me see...
The Memoirs
of Casanova?
Every night,
and then we'd
turn out the light.
"We"?
I was only so big.
You must've had
a happy childhood.
Ah, yes.
And women?
Oh, women.
You've known
quite a few,
haven't you?
I don't know.
Or perhaps "few"
is the wrong word.
Let's say
it's not precise.
I beg your pardon,
Signor Ferrante.
Would you like me
to reserve this table
for you every night?
Why not?
Thank you.
Now, where were we?
And I suppose
they've all been madly
in love with you?
I doubt it.
But you haven't had
much respect for them.
On the contrary...
Still, you've always
been very fair
in your judgments.
Yes. I've been
more than fair.
I idealize them.
Every woman I meet,
I put up there.
Of course,
the longer I know her
and the better
I know her...
It's hard to
keep them up there,
isn't it?
Yes, isn't it?
Pretty soon,
the pedestal wobbles
and then topples.
C'est la vie,
et cetera.
Come on.
Let's talk about you.
No, not tonight.
We'll talk about me
some other time.
We've nothing planned
for tomorrow.
Oh, I have.
Oh, no.
We'll talk about me
tomorrow.
It turned out
beautifully, didn't it?
It's really warm.
Thank you.
Now, where were we?
You were going to tell me
where you were born.
That's right.
Well...
Mr. Ferrante?
Cablegram.
Thank you.
Excuse me,
Miss McKay.
Miss McKay?
Yes?
Oh, I have one
for you, too.
Oh.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Excuse me,
Mr. Ferrante.
From him?
From her?
Mmm-hmm.
Mmm-hmm.
Well, where were we?
Well, I was about
to tell you
where I was born
and I was born
in Boston.
I can hardly wait
for you to grow up.
Yes. Well, be patient.
I grew up quickly.
Then I went
to New York
and got a job
singing in a nightclub
from 10:00 to 3:00
in the morning
and the manager
used to chase me
around the office
until about 4:00
and then...
I went home.
Did he ever...
Oh, no, no.
No, no.
No.
Well, then one evening,
he came along.
This is the fellow.
Mmm-hmm.
And he said,
"You don't belong in
a place like this."
Really?
Mmm-hmm.
And I said,
"I don't?"
And well, then...
Mmm?
What?
What "what?"
I don't know,
I thought
you said something.
No, I didn't
say anything.
Oh, I'm sorry.
But you're right,
you know?
He said I belonged
in a penthouse
on Park Avenue
with a breathtaking view
of the East River.
An ideal place for you
to improve yourself.
Yes.
So, I studied hard.
Singing? And...
And music and art
and literature.
Mmm.
So that one day you'd make
a perfectly charming wife.
Yes, that was
the general idea.
Anything wrong
with that?
No, no, there's
nothing wrong with it.
That's what I thought.
Well, that sort of
brings us up-to-date.
Now my life
is an open book.
That's only one page.
Well, that's
the only page.
I beg your pardon.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
No, no. Bad, bad.
Wait a minute.
That's a very
interesting camera.
May I see that?
Oh, yes.
It's new, isn't it?
Thank you.
Oh, please!
Please, stop!
That's unfortunate,
isn't it?
That was not
very nice.
You shouldn't
have done that.
I know.
You know,
it's obviously no good,
either of us
being seen together.
Right or wrong,
people will talk
and so I guess
it had better
be good-bye.
That seems a pity.
Good-bye.
Well, what's the matter?
Are you afraid?
Of you?
Yeah.
No.
Well, you know,
we have several days
to go on this voyage
and I can't
stand monotony.
Well, you can always
take long walks
in the sunshine.
What'll I do
if it rains?
No. No, it's no good.
You mean,
it's particularly
no good for you.
Yes.
Being seen with you
is news
and I don't want to get
my picture in the papers.
So, I'll go my way
and you'll go yours.
Help! Help!
Oh!
Oh, here, let me...
Oh, my Lord,
he's heavy.
What's the matter?
Are you in trouble?
Yes. Give me a hand.
He's a bit heavy.
Come on, chum.
I've got him.
That's right.
No, let it go.
Try it the other
way around, Dad.
Oh, thank you. That's...
You're a great help.
Well, how'd you
come to do that?
I got...
I got tangled up.
Mmm-hmm.
Couldn't get down, huh?
Mmm-hmm.
Oh, you're
quite a fella.
You're quite
a fella yourself.
Yes? Why?
Everybody on the ship's
talking about ya.
No kidding?
What are they saying?
I don't know
on account of
every time they start
talking about ya,
they make me
leave the room.
I don't get it.
You take over.
Mmm.
You know, you want
to watch it, chum.
You might
hurt yourself.
When I was little like you,
I fell and broke my leg.
How is it now?
It's all right,
I guess.
Well, what are
ya crabbing about?
I'm not cra...
I'm sorry.
Champagne cocktail,
please.
Yes, sir.
Have you
any cigarettes?
The smoke room
steward, sir.
Thank you.
This way.
Have you got
pink champagne?
Of course.
Let me try it.
Good evening.
Good evening,
mademoiselle.
Could I have
a champagne cocktail,
please?
Yes, mademoiselle.
Do you have
pink champagne?
Of course.
Thank you.
Hello.
Hello.
I changed my table
to a table for one.
So did I.
Now, isn't that a shame
after that
delightful dinner
we had together
last night?
And do you
speak Gaelic?
Fluently.
How do you say,
"Let's get out of here?"
Hmm.
Well, well, well!
Well.
Oh, well, well.
That's good,
isn't it?
This is what's known
as fooling the world.
Hmm? What did you say?
I said,
this is what's known
as fooling the world.
I can't hear
what you said.
What are you saying?
Oh, who do you think
you're hiding from?
Everybody's
staring at us.
This is awful.
I'm going to leave.
No, no. Let me.
Don't worry.
That made it worse.
Sit down!
Will you sit down?
You forgot...
Pardon me, sir.
That's the lady's purse.
Yes. I was just...
No, no.
Wait a minute.
The last one...
Oh!
What...
Oh!
Oh, my,
it's a small pool,
isn't it?
Now, don't change
the subject.
You've got
my cigarette case.
Well, not on me.
We've got a five-hour
stopover here.
We're coming
into Villefranche.
Yes, you going ashore?
Yes, I'm calling
on a lady.
Ah. In every port, huh?
This happens to
be my grandmother.
Well, don't you
believe me?
Mmm, no.
Would you like
to meet her?
Yes, I'd like to
meet your grandmother.
Well, you've got a date.
Surprised?
All right.
Is this a present
for your little
old grandmother?
Yes. Yes, it is.
Uh-huh.
Isn't it beautiful
down there?
Huh?
I said, isn't it
beautiful down there?
Yes.
But do you want to
hear an old joke?
What?
If it's so beautiful
down there, why did...
You bring me up here?
That's an old joke,
all right.
Mmm-hmm.
You're quite sure
your grandmother
isn't an old joke?
Oh, I do wish
you'd trust me.
Oh!
What a divine place.
It's perfect!
I'm beginning to think
you have a grandmother.
Oh, that's surprising.
I'll try to find her
and prove it.
Janou!
Janou!
Janou?
Janou?
She's not there.
Look.
She must be
in the chapel.
Ah, Fidel!
How are you, fella?
Yes, yes, yes.
How are you, boy?
What is it
about this place?
There's something about it
that makes you
want to whisper.
It's so peaceful here.
It's like another world.
Mmm-hmm.
Well, it is.
It's my grandmother's
world.
Do tell me more
about her.
My grandfather was
in the diplomatic service.
They traveled
all over the world
and when he retired,
they came here to live.
He's buried there
behind the chapel.
She stayed on
to be near him.
She must be waiting,
I think a little
impatiently,
for the day
she would join him.
Oh, Nicolo!
Oh!
Oh, Nicolo!
Oh, Nicolo!
Darling,
this is Terry McKay.
How do you do?
How do you do?
Janou thought
you were the girl
I'm going to marry.
Oh.
Oh, pardon moi.
I was only saying
I like you very much.
Oh, thank you.
I'm glad.
Well, if you
will excuse me,
I must sit down.
I am longer at
my prayers nowadays.
Oh, my knees!
They're as old
as I am.
Oh, you have the most
beautiful place here.
Thank you.
I think I could
stay here forever.
Oh, no, no, no.
You are too young
for that, my dear.
It is a good place
to sit and remember,
but you have still
to create your memories.
And the chapel
seems so charming.
Oh, would you like
to go in?
Oh, may I?
Oh, thank you.
Oh, Nicolo!
And you, Nicolo,
how long is it
since you have been
in a chapel, huh?
Oh, well, I...
Not since you were
an altar boy, huh?
No.
Go in.
It won't hurt you.
All right.
I will prepare the tea.
Let me help you.
No, no, no, no.
Marius.
Oui, madame.
Oh! Monsieur Nicholas!
Oh. Ah!
Marius!
This is Marie.
Well, hello!
This is my friend
Marius.
Oh, madame.
Hello.
Marius has had
three children
since I last saw him.
Marius says,
"France needs men."
So he has
seven daughters.
Come to see
the rest of my family.
Yes, go along.
Sure?
I should like
a little tête-à-tête
with Miss McKay.
Oh, Janou,
please be kind.
I won't betray you.
Can I help you?
Oh, thank you,
my dear.
I am glad you are not
like so many
young people nowadays,
above a little
housework.
There were 10 of us
in our family.
We all had to
do our share,
or go to bed
without supper.
Oh, what
a magnificent room!
Oh, yes.
My husband was
a great collector.
He loved
beautiful things.
Me, too.
I should have a housekeeper,
but I have outlived two
and I'm too old
to start breaking in
another one.
Besides,
I don't mind
telling you,
I had planned only
to live till I was 80.
Now I am 82.
Well, if I'm not
going to die,
I must start
saving money
for my old age.
You're very wise.
Ah!
You like it?
Mmm, yes.
It's charming.
Who...
"Ferrante"?
Nicolo!
Nickie?
Yes. He did that
a long time ago.
Oh, but it's very good.
He is very talented.
Oh, forgive me. You see,
I had no means
of knowing.
Unfortunately,
he is also very critical.
The artist in him
would create,
the critic
would destroy.
As a result,
he has done nothing since.
What a pity.
Mmm.
Besides, he's been too busy,
living, as they call it.
Mmm-hmm.
May I?
Oh, thank you,
my dear.
There.
It has been such
a tremendous excitement
for me, this visit.
I am trying
to appear calm.
Don't you think
I do pretty well?
You do wonderfully well.
Here we are.
Thank you.
I love Nicolo so much.
When he was
a small boy,
he charmed us all
with his piano playing.
Then he studied painting.
And the worst of it
is he's so good
at everything.
A jack-of-all-talents.
Everything comes
too easily to him.
He's always
attracted by the art
he isn't practicing.
The place he hasn't been,
the girl he hasn't met.
Perhaps I shouldn't
have met him.
No, my dear.
You are different.
I don't mind
confessing to you,
I have been worried
about him.
Sometimes I'm frightened.
Why?
That life will present
a bill to Nicolo one day
and he will find
it hard to pay.
But when
I see you with him,
I feel better.
Me? You do?
Yes. You.
Well, I wish I could
share your confidence.
You will have it
when you need it.
That is your character.
Oh, there is nothing
wrong with Nicolo
that a good woman
couldn't make right.
Mmm.
Well, I saw
Marius' entire family.
Seven daughters.
I congratulated him
and had a nice talk
with his wife.
You should have had
a nice talk with him.
And don't sit on my hat.
Tell me,
what have you two
been talking about?
Hmm.
Oh, you'd be surprised.
I'll bet I would.
And I'll bet
that Janou did
all the talking.
Mmm-hmm.
She's been telling me
that when you were
a little boy
and didn't get
your own way,
you'd lie on the floor
and kick and
get red in the face.
Really?
You should've
winked the other eye.
Oh.
And what did you say?
I said you didn't
do that anymore.
No!
No.
Now when you don't
get your own way,
you just
get embarrassed.
Want some tea?
Remind me not
to explain that
to you later.
Yes, I want some tea.
Janou, I have
a gift for you.
JANOU: Oh!
Come and see it.
I am too old
for gifts.
No one's too old
for gifts.
You shouldn't
spend your money
so recklessly.
It didn't cost much.
Let me help you.
Oh, Nicolo.
How did you do it?
I did it from memory.
Thank you.
It is Andre,
my husband.
It's so real,
so like him.
What a remarkable face.
Did you do that
from memory?
Yes.
Do you like it?
Oh, it's wonderful.
I painted that
a long time ago,
but I hesitated
about giving it to you.
I told you
he has talent.
Mmm-hmm.
Well, now, for you.
For me? Thank you.
For you.
Thank you.
For me.
Well, now...
I should like
to propose
a little toast.
I don't quite know
how to phrase it.
Well, would it have
something to do with
his happy marriage?
JANOU: Mmm.
Shall we say,
may your voyage home
be a pleasant one.
Thank you.
Well, now,
I'm afraid we must
be leaving soon.
It has been
a good day.
Now, before we go,
you must play
the piano for us.
Oh, no, Nicolo.
Come along.
No, no, no.
Please do.
Look at my hands.
No excuses.
Come along.
Come on.
Oh.
Janou was
a concert pianist.
Was.
Remember,
I was asked to do this.
I don't like
boat whistles.
Don't you think
you should put this
around your shoulders?
Thank you,
my dear.
It's lovely,
isn't it?
You like it?
Yes, I do.
One day,
I will send it to you.
Oh, no.
I would like to.
This is as far
as I go.
This is the boundary
of my small world.
Hmm.
It's a perfect world.
Thank you for
letting me trespass.
Good-bye.
Bless you.
Well, au revoir,
dear Janou.
I'll come back to
see you very soon
and I'll write often.
Please do.
I will.
Oh! Happy thoughts,
darling.
Adieu, mon petit.
Good-bye.
Good-bye.
I've been looking
everywhere for you.
I called your cabin...
You've been crying.
Mmm-hmm.
Beauty does that to me.
Nickie, I want to
thank you for the...
The loveliest and
the most memorable day
I've ever known.
You were very sweet
to my little grandmother.
I'm going to
write to her.
That'll be nice.
Let's walk, hmm?
No more tears.
I told you that's what
beauty does to me.
We're heading into
a rough sea, Nickie.
I know.
We changed
our course today.
Mmm-hmm.
Shall I see you
to your cabin?
I don't think so.
Good night.
Good night.
Just a moment.
Terry...
Oh!
Why did you come here?
You know it's dangerous.
Darling, we've got
a lot to talk about.
I am aware of that,
but to be seen together
could be disastrous
for us both.
I know, but we have
some fast thinking to do.
We've created
a problem.
Yes, I know.
So let's not
complicate it any more.
Being a woman,
I'm naturally
more cautious
and I can think
more clearly when
you're not around.
So you go think
in your room and
I'll think in mine.
All right.
While we miss
each other.
Oh, that was very sweet,
what you just said.
Top of the mornin'
to you.
And the rest of
the day to you.
No, listen. What?
No, no.
Keep moving.
Oh, dear.
Wait a minute.
Don't go away.
Now, have you come
to any conclusions yet?
No, keep moving.
Oh, dear.
I miss you.
I miss you, too.
Why don't you
telephone more often?
I'll try,
but you know...
Were you going
to say something?
No, I wasn't going
to say anything.
Oh.
Listen. Couldn't we
at least eat together,
you know,
in your room
or my room?
The news would be
all around the ship
before we'd had our salad.
I know.
The crew talks, too,
you know.
Do go around the other way.
You're making me dizzy.
Yeah, be better
for me also,
I can tell you that.
Oh, wait a minute.
Darling...
Listen, darling, I...
That's odd.
Well...
Good evening, sir.
Good evening.
Is Miss McKay dining?
Yes, sir.
Would you care
to join her?
No, I think she prefers
to dine alone.
She's almost
finished, sir.
Yes.
Whew.
Order the bouillabaisse.
It's superb.
Shut up.
Come in.
Hello there.
Oh, hello,
Mr. Hathaway.
Miss McKay,
where's Ferrante?
Ferra...
Well, how should I know?
Oh, come now.
A little bird told me
he might be in here.
Oh, really,
Mr. Hathaway.
Don't you think you're
being a little rude
and presumptuous?
I haven't seen
Mr. Ferrante since...
Hello, Terry.
It occurred to me you
might like this book.
Yeah.
I've read it.
I haven't seen you
for days.
I thought you must have
got off somewhere.
Why, no. We haven't
docked anywhere.
Well, in case I don't
see you again, Miss McKay,
happy landing.
Thank you, Mr. Ferrante,
and don't think it
hasn't been absolute...
Now, slow down.
I'm wondering
if you two would
do me a big favor.
What's that?
Would you be so kind
as to autograph these?
My wife and my sister and I
each bought a different one.
You bought them?
From whom?
Why, the ship's
photographer.
He has a big display up
on the promenade deck.
He's doing
a wholesale business.
Well, I'll tell you,
Mr. Hathaway,
we'll have to
think about it.
Now, where could
I find you?
Well, I'll either be
in the cocktail lounge,
or, of course,
the dining room.
Yes, of course.
Well...
Oh!
FERRANTE:
Oh, I don't mind that one.
That's pretty good.
TERRY:
Oh, do be serious!
This is dreadful!
And after all the pains
we took deceiving everybody.
I'm particularly
sorry for you.
You know,
I'm not as sorry
as I thought I'd be.
It was rather silly,
hiding like fugitives,
wasn't it?
Yes. Yes, I know.
So, to coin a new cliché,
shall we join the others?
Well, all right.
Well, why not?
What have we got
to lose?
The last night.
Let's make
the most of it.
Good.
Hi, Hathaway.
Hey!
Do me another favor.
Let's swap partners.
It's the last
night out, you know?
Everybody does it.
They do? How nice.
In your case,
we'll make an exception.
I don't get that guy.
BOTH:
Day by day I'm growing fonder
Of those
tender things you do
Oh, nice crossing.
Hello.
Let's get some air.
Yeah, come on.
I'll show you
the rudder.
Where is it?
Aft.
Got to get my coat.
Careful.
ALL:
May sometimes try to lure me
Can't you think of
something spiteful
Something mean
that you could do
Must you be
so darn delightful
BOTH: You make it easy
to be true
Oh.
Why can't we go on
doing this forever,
huh?
I had a talk
with the captain.
It won't work.
It won't?
No.
He said he can't
turn the ship around.
Quite nice about it,
but he said
that most of the people
want to get home.
Isn't that silly?
Mmm-hmm.
Well, I can understand
his problem.
Cruising around
in the ocean with
just the two of us.
You make it easy
to be true
ALL:  Be forgot
And never brought
to mind
Should old acquaintance
be forgot
And days
of old lang syne
If you say, "A penny
for your thoughts,"
I'll jump overboard.
Well...
Tomorrow morning,
New York.
Yes.
Will he be waiting?
Will she?
Mmm-hmm.
Oh, yes.
What makes life
so difficult?
People?
Tsk.
Are you in love
with him?
I'm not now.
Mmm.
You know, I've never
done a day's work
in my whole life.
In my whole life,
I've never...
I know. I've been
thinking about that.
Hmm? What'd you say?
I didn't say anything.
Yes, yes, you did.
What?
You said I was very fond
of expensive things.
Furs and diamonds
and stuff like that.
Did I say that?
Mmm-hmm.
Pink champagne.
That's the kind of life
we've both been used to.
It might be
a little difficult to...
Do you like beer?
Mmm, mmm.
Different.
Mmm-hmm.
My father drank beer
in the morning.
He was a beer drinker?
Mmm-hmm.
Hmm.
Later in the day,
he drank anything.
Oh, winter must be cold
for those with
no warm memories.
We've already
missed the spring.
Yes. Well,
this is probably
my last chance.
Mine, too.
It's now or never.
Hmm. "Never" is
a frightening word.
We'd be fools to let
happiness pass us by.
Mmm-hmm.
And just because
you haven't...
I haven't worked
doesn't mean to
say I couldn't, huh?
No, of course not.
Suppose, I...
It would take some time,
say, six months,
to find out if...
If? If what?
Well, just suppose.
Now, be realistic.
All right.
If I worked hard enough
and long enough,
say, for six months,
where would you be?
What are you trying
to say, Nickie?
Well, I just want to be
worthy of
asking you to marry me.
Oh.
Nickie, that's just
about the nicest...
Your voice cracked.
Oh, well,
that's because I...
Yes, I know. I know.
I'm going to
turn in now.
Do some more
rolling and tossing
and thinking about it.
Let me tell you
in the morning, hmm?
It's going to
be a long night.
Mmm-hmm.
For me, too.
Marriage is
a very serious step
for a girl like me.
Yes, I know.
Do you like children?
Yes. Yes, I do.
Nickie.
Oh, I was so worried.
I didn't even have
time to get dressed.
I didn't get to
sleep until 5:00.
I didn't sleep at all.
Oh.
Now,
listen carefully.
Yes.
If everything goes right,
and I mean for both
of us, in six months...
Here. I started
to write it out.
Should I read it now?
Mmm-hmm.
All right.
"Darling," that's me?
Mmm-hmm.
"You have a date,
my beloved,
July 1 at 5:00."
But you don't
say where.
You name the place
and I'll obey.
I don't know.
I can't think.
How about the top of
the Empire State Building?
Oh, yes,
that's perfect.
It's the nearest thing
to heaven we have
in New York.
The 102nd floor,
and don't forget to
take the elevator.
No, I won't.
Darling, if things
don't work out...
Don't talk like that.
I'm not listening.
But just in case
one of us is...
We'll both be there.
Hold the thought.
Hold the thought.
Take care.
Take care.
Hmm.
Nickie darling! Oh!
Oh, Nickie.
Well, I'm so glad
to see you.
How've you been?
I'm so glad to see you.
Did you have a good trip?
Not too bad.
A little rough in spots,
but very pleasant.
PHOTOGRAPHER: Hold it
for a picture.
That's fine.
Thank you.
Did you get
to see Pinky?
May I have one,
too, please?
Yes, how's this?
Thank you.
No, I think he's on
his way to Tangier.
May I have
another one, please?
He's always going
off someplace. Yes.
That's fine.
Thank you.
Another one, please.
Excuse me.
I have an important
appointment.
Excuse me.
Thank you so much.
May I?
Terry darling.
Hello, darling.
It's been so long.
Oh, it's wonderful
to have you back.
It's wonderful
to be back, Ken.
Darling,
the car's around here.
What's the matter?
Shall we get going?
Yes, let's.
Shall we?
The car's
right out here.
Good.
FERRANTE: Darling,
there's something
I must discuss with you.
It's been on my mind,
so let's go in here
where we can be
alone and quiet...
What in the world
is all this?
Didn't I mention it?
What?
Dear, the TV people
have been after me
for an interview,
so I finally said yes
if they give
a big donation
to my favorite charity,
and they did.
You don't mind,
do you, darling?
It's for a good cause.
I wish you'd
let me know.
Oh, listen,
I know you.
If I'd told you,
I'd never have got
you off the ship.
Camera one,
take close-ups.
Oh, Nickie, dear,
this is Mr. Lewis who's
going to interview us.
Mr. Fulton Q. Lewis.
Robert.
Robert Fulton,
how do you do?
No, Robert Q. Lewis,
but everybody does that.
Please, look,
you're a little late,
and we've got
to go on the air.
Would you mind
coming over here,
Miss Clark, please?
Just sit yourselves
right down here.
I'm going to ask
a few questions,
then we're going to...
What about his face?
Shiny. Look, Harry.
Would you mind
a little makeup?
Harry, just blot it.
I'm sorry, darling.
It'll be over with soon.
I hope so.
Oh, incidentally,
that white shirt,
how about that?
Glares.
You don't happen to
have a blue shirt?
No, not with me.
Well, yes.
Well, look, don't worry.
We'll manage.
Let me explain
what I'm going to do.
I'd like to ask
a few questions
about how you met...
Just a few.
I will.
Just how you met,
what your plans are
and things like that.
You make yourselves
comfortable.
Thank you.
MAN: Five seconds,
Mr. Lewis.
Right.
Now, then, one thing,
watch the camera.
When the red light
is on, you're on.
Yeah? Well, it's on.
Oh, hello there,
and welcome to another
House to House program,
brought to you
by the Benton
Baby Food Company.
Remember, Benton's
builds better babies.
Today, our cameras are
placed in the home
of Miss Lois Clark,
heiress to one of
America's greatest fortunes.
In just a moment,
we'll meet Miss Clark
and her fiancé,
Mr. Nickie Ferrante
and talk to them about
their wonderful
true-to-life romance
which has gotten
headlines in papers
all over the country.
A romance which has
captured the imagination
of the whole world.
But first...
Do you think
they're in love?
I wouldn't know,
Gladys.
I can't wait to see
that Nickie Ferrante.
I don't know what
the $64 million
question was,
but he's certainly
got the answer.
Point killer.
Terry, darling.
WOMAN SINGING ON TV:
So buy Baby Soft
Buy Baby Soft
Hmm.
Remind me to
ask you later
why your kisses don't
seem quite the same.
Maybe you're just out
of practice, I hope.
Yum, yum
We don't need that
darn thing on, do we?
Buy Baby Benton's
Better Baby Food
It's got more zip...
I see you haven't
changed yet.
I thought I gave
you plenty of time
to get into
something more...
Well, Ken, we have
so much to talk about
and I can
just think better
in this outfit.
You know, darling,
I hoped the trip
would be good for you,
but I'm afraid you
don't look so well.
What's the matter?
Was it a rough crossing?
Yes, yes.
Yes, it was a little.
Oh.
You know, Ken,
that program might
have been amusing.
Lois Clark and
Nickie Ferrante were
about to come on.
I'm only interested
in you, dear, but if
it'll entertain you...
Mmm-hmm.
Yes, it will.
Okay.
Say, Mr. Ferrante,
you must have had
some wonderful
experiences in Europe.
Yes.
Well, would you care
to expand that statement?
No.
Oh.
There are
so many questions...
Oh, I forgot Ferrante
was on the same boat
with you, wasn't he?
Yes, he was.
Did you meet him?
Mmm-hmm.
Was he charming?
Mmm-hmm.
LOIS: Well, I'm sure
Nickie has all...
Fascinating?
LEWIS: Well, good...
Mmm-hmm.
LEWIS: Well, you know,
financial difficulties...
Irresistible?
...often cause
the breakup
of marriages.
Oh, I'm sorry.
That wasn't like me.
I withdraw that remark.
LOIS: That won't be one
of our difficulties.
Well, tell me,
Mr. Ferrante,
is this
your first experience
with connubial bliss?
Would you mind
rephrasing the question?
LOIS:
Darling! Darling!
He means is this
your first experience
with marriage?
Oh, that's what
he meant. Yes.
Good. Do you intend
to support your wife
in the
manner to which...
Yes.
That's very funny.
LOIS: Doing what?
Well, I'm going to
begin to paint again.
That's how I intend
to support my wife.
LEWIS: Oh, well...
That's certainly going to
take an awful lot of paint.
I mean, you already
have a house full
of masterpieces.
Yes, we have
and I didn't realize
that you were going to...
I'm still going
to paint.
Oh, really?
Well, I mean,
I just thought you'd
given all that up.
I know,
but I shouldn't have.
Well, I'm sure Nickie
has all kinds of plans.
Yes, I have.
Well, good.
When are you going
to be married?
We're going
to be married
as soon as we...
Just a moment, dear.
In six months.
Six months.
I'll bet she never
gets him to the altar.
Six months.
Well, good.
Thank you so much,
Miss Clark,
and you, too,
Mr. Ferrante.
Well, folks,
that winds up our interview
with this charming couple.
Terry?
Mmm-hmm.
I'd like to ask
that question again.
Did you find
Ferrante irresistible?
Oh, Ken,
I'm sorry.
You don't
plan these things.
They just happen!
Darling, it just
doesn't make sense.
I know.
I know it doesn't.
You've got to
be realistic.
About love?
But you know what
everyone says about him.
Yes, I know,
I know, I know.
What are you
going to do?
Oh, I don't know, Ken.
I think I'll...
I think I'll go back
to Boston
and try and get a job
or something
in singing again
until he can...
Until he what?
Darling, he'll never
be able to support you.
Oh, Terry, listen to me.
I want to marry you.
I know I should
have asked you
a long time ago.
It's my fault,
but it's not too late,
is it?
It can't be too late.
Terry, look at me.
Can't you see
I'm in love?
Mmm-hmm.
So am I.
Well, do you think
you can sell it?
Of course, I'll try.
You did this
without a model?
Yeah,
I couldn't afford one.
What is it?
Something wrong
with my memory?
It's getting
a trifle dim.
No.
And this?
I painted that
from memory.
That was my lunch.
You know,
it's a woman.
Yes.
You mean,
you wouldn't care
to be seen with her?
I doubt it.
You know, Nickie,
if you would let me
tell people,
by people I mean women,
who painted this,
I could sell it
and plenty more.
No, no, no.
The old Ferrante is dead.
But signing "Rossi"
don't mean a thing.
If you use
your own name...
The old Ferrante
is dead
and the new Rossi
is starving.
What do you expect
in three months?
Remember, the brush
obeys your hand.
It doesn't know
you are accustomed to
getting your own way.
You are spoiled,
but the brush
doesn't know this.
He cannot humor you.
I know, I know,
but I was hoping
you'd sell something.
I want the thrill
of earning
that first dollar.
Well, I'll have
to get a job.
What?
And give up painting?
No, I'm not going
to give up painting.
It's the only thing
I know.
But I've got
to earn money.
I've got to earn
a lot of it quickly.
Of course,
in the meantime,
I'll buy you lunch.
You can repay me
when you're famous.
That's the first
encouraging thing
you've said.
There you are.
Isn't that extraordinary?
Wouldn't you think
that's the one thing
I could remember?
Yeah.
Hmm.
Hmm. Oh, well...
TERRY:
We'll be walking on clouds
You'll forget every care
And your troubles like bubbles
Will vanish
In air
Ask me how do you get
To Tomorrow Land
Close your eyes
Make a wish
And you're there
Close your eyes
Make a wish
And you're
There
Nickie! Nickie!
Hey!
Hey!
I have good news!
I sold one of your women.
You know,
the one with
the uh-huh.
I got $200 for her.
Your first dollar!
What's the matter
with you?
My friend,
I'm a happy man.
I am a painter.
So what? I've been
a painter for years,
but I ain't happy.
Oh, well...
Thank you. Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen.
As you know,
this is my last night
so I would love to
sing a song for you
that is very close
to my heart.
Our love affair
Is a wondrous thing
That we'll rejoice
In remembering
Our love was born
With our first embrace
And a page was torn
Out of time and space
Our love affair
May it always be
A flame to burn
Through eternity
So take my hand
With a fervent prayer
That we may live
And we may share
A love affair
To remember
A love affair
To remember
Did you fasten
your seat belt?
Mmm-hmm.
It's fastened.
There's the Empire
State Building.
Thank you.
Miss McKay, my dear.
My favorite customer,
welcome back.
Thank you.
Miss Webb,
look who's back.
Well, Miss McKay.
We were just saying,
"Whatever happened
to Miss McKay?"
And here you are.
How nice
you're looking.
Mmm-hmm. Yes, I know,
I didn't get it here.
Where have you been
these past months?
In Boston.
Oh. Well,
we've missed you.
Oh, thank you.
I've missed you,
too, Miss...
Lane.
Yes, Miss Lane.
Now, Miss Lane,
I want something
very, very special for...
Miss Webb will
be very happy
to take care of you,
Miss McKay.
Excuse me.
I have something
to do in the office.
All right.
Well, of course,
I'd be most happy
to take care of you.
Now, what did you
have in mind?
Well, I want something
irresistible,
inexpensive and pink.
Oh, but, of course!
We have it.
The most beautiful.
I've been hiding
it just for you.
I tell you,
you give Miss McKay
anything in the shop
she wants.
But keep talking to her
until I get there,
will you?
That's all we wanted
to know.
Fine. Say, you weren't
worried about her credit,
were you?
I'm surprised at you.
Good-bye.
This is adorable.
Mmm. It's a little short,
isn't it?
Oh. With these.
Oh, no.
Oh, but look.
Look! Look!
This is a must.
Yes, it's lovely,
but I just want
the little item
I decided on.
All right,
we'll send it.
I'll have to let
you know where,
because
I'm not quite sure.
I believe that's right.
No charge?
No.
No?
No. I know,
I know, but, no.
Why, Ken!
Terry.
How are you?
What are you doing here?
How did you know I...
Uh-huh, I see.
Nice doing business
with you.
Oh, forgive me, Ken.
I'm terribly late.
What time is it?
It's five minutes
to 5:00.
Oh! Oh, it's been good
seeing you, Ken.
It's good seeing you,
too, Terry.
There's so much to
talk to you about.
I'm sorry,
but I'm in such a hurry.
Can't we go someplace
and have a cocktail?
No, I really am
in a hurry.
But I have so much
to say to you.
Why don't you
give me a call...
You can't do that,
because I'm getting
marr...
You're getting married?
Yes.
Yes, I am, Ken,
and I'm very, very late.
What time did
you say it was?
Four minutes to 5:00.
Well, good-bye, Ken.
Terry.
I really hope
you've found happiness
and if you're ever
in need of anything,
like someone to love you,
don't hesitate to call me.
No. No, I won't.
Good-bye, Ken.
Good-bye.
Good luck.
Shows what
a state I'm in.
I thought the Empire
State Building
was this way,
and, of course,
it's that way!
I think I'll get out here,
because I'm in a hurry.
Here you are.
Keep the change.
What's the rush, lady?
I'm going to be married,
and I want you
to be the first
to congratulate me.
Thank you.
Marriage is something
to rush to?
MAN: 102nd floor.
Going down?
No. No, thank you.
MAN: Tower.
Going down?
No, no.
And what time have you?
Ten after 5:00.
Thank you.
I know what I'm doing.
I want my own way!
Turn the boat around!
I want to turn
the boat around.
Nickie, help me
turn the boat around.
Well, you're so...
You're so much
stronger than I am.
I can't do it alone.
I can't.
I can't.
You must be quiet now.
But... But I need him!
Oh, Nickie,
I need you!
Help me! Help me!
Help me turn
the boat around.
I must... I must...
Going down?
Her X-rays aren't
very encouraging.
It's hard to say if
she'll ever walk again.
We won't know
for a long while.
That's...
That's bad.
I guess you've
gathered by now
I'm not the man
she was screaming about.
She was on her way
to marry him.
Does he know
of her condition?
No.
She said until you know
what you say you
won't know for a while,
she'd rather
he didn't know.
She seems nice.
I think so.
She wants to see you.
Go ahead.
I'll be in shortly.
Hello, Ken.
Hello, Terry.
I told her I didn't
know whether or not
she'd be with us today.
Fooled you, Father.
Ken, I told Father
McGrath about us.
He's going to
find me a job,
aren't you, Father?
You'd better get
well first, Terry.
He's right.
Then I'll try
and come up
with something.
Oh.
Take it easy.
Yes.
AN AFFAIR TO REMEMBER
Monsieur Nicolo.
Pour Miss McKay.
Merci, Marius.
Miss McKay?
Yes?
I want to thank you
for what you're doing
for my son Tyrone.
Now he won't grow up
to be a mug like me.
Oh, you're too modest,
Mr. Bugsy.
Oh, no, I ain't.
I'm so stupid,
I ain't even ignorant.
Thanks again.
Don't thank me.
Thank Father McGrath.
He got the job for me.
Thanks, Father.
All eyes on me,
please.
Now, as you know,
poor Mollie has the measles,
so I'll sing her part.
Now, are we ready?
Oh.
Well, now we're ready.
Watch me closely.
We mustn't goof today.
ALL:
They say there's
a tiny little scout
Who follows you about
He knows everything
you say and do
You couldn't lose him
if you wanted to
He knows, like for
instance when you try
To tell a big, fat lie
He starts burning up
at what you said
That's why
your face gets red
When you do good
like he says you should
You can bet he's
as merry as a clown
But when you've done something
and your heart starts thumping
That's him
jumpin' up and down
He's there anytime
that you're in doubt
To tell you what to do
Get smart
Listen to the tiny scout
He knows you inside
He knows you outside
He knows
what it's all about
Without a doubt
He knows you inside out
So you hate to go
to Sunday school
And that's not bad enough
You start messing
with the Golden Rule
You think being good
is sissy stuff
Get wise, try to mend
your dopey ways
Ya might be glad ya did
Then you'll never
hear the corny phrase
Poor little mixed-up kid
When you prove
you can't be trusted
You can say
you're maladjusted
You can blame your ma and pa
If you're a schmo
But you show
a streak of yeller
When you blame
the other feller
Look out
GIRLS: You may sizzle
down below
ALL: You don't have
to be a teacher's pet
Don't worry wings won't sprout
Just get smart
Listen to the tiny scout
He knows you inside
He knows you outside
You're on the wrong side
He's on the right side
He knows you backwards
He knows you forwards
You're on the mean side
He's on the clean side
Whew!
I'm running out of breath
Stop smoking
You're saying yes, yes
He's saying uh-uh
You think you've got to
He tells you not to
He's there beside you
all set to guide you
Rah, rah, rah
sis, boom, bah
Ricky, ticky, tin
and a ricky ticky tout
How about a cheer
for the tiny scout
'Cause he knows you
inside out
Good side, bad side,
clean side, mean side
Wrong side, right side,
outside, inside
He's your friend
without a doubt
He's your conscience
He knows you
Inside
Out
Well!
Come in!
Nickie, I'm so happy
to see you.
My dear friend!
Come in. Come in.
Come in.
How's my
severest critic?
Oh, well, we'll see.
Oh, I see you've got
them all arranged.
Come on.
Let me hear the worst.
Six months' work.
You haven't wasted
your time, Nickie.
Thank you.
Oh, you should have
seen the 50
I dropped over
the cliff though.
Maybe you should have
dropped this one, too.
Yes, I'm inclined
to agree with you
about that one.
You know, Nickie,
I can read
your state of mind
when you painted this.
Yeah?
You were very sorry
for yourself when
you painted this one.
That one was painted
in August.
Doesn't count.
Mmm.
You were angry here.
You were getting
over your broken heart.
Broken heart?
Oh, that stuff's
not for me.
I'm glad to hear that.
Come on. Let's get
down to this end.
Come on.
I'm coming to that.
I'm coming to that.
Yeah, here, Nickie,
you became a painter.
Thank you.
I'm not exactly ashamed
of that one myself.
I had a great deal to say
and I painted it instead.
Your being away,
alone, for a long time,
has given you
that grasp of...
I'll get it.
Remember where you were.
I want to hear
more of that.
Hello? Courbet's Paint
and Varnish Store.
Nickie?
I read you arrived today.
Lois, how nice.
How did you know
I was here?
I called your hotel,
and they said
you could be reached
at this number.
Oh, Nickie, I've been
thinking about you
morning, noon and night
and in-between times, too.
I was wondering if
maybe you could...
A-ha.
Well, no, no,
I like the idea
all right.
That's a nice offer,
but I don't think I can
make it this afternoon.
Well, if you
can't do that...
Oh, I wish you would.
Mmm-mmm.
Thanks anyway.
Nicest thing that's
happened today.
Oh.
But you could make
the show tonight.
Well, I'll leave a ticket
at the box office anyway.
Do try to make it.
And, Nickie...
Whatever you do,
don't plan anything
for after the show, huh?
I love our seats.
What?
I said
I love our seats.
We enjoyed it
very much.
Thank you
for asking us.
Oh, it was a pleasure.
If you don't mind,
Mr. Ferrante will
see me home.
Very well.
Good night.
Good night.
Good night.
Now, where would
you like to go?
Suppose you decide,
Nickie.
After all,
this is your evening.
I've been away so long
I have no idea where
people go nowadays.
My coat.
Hello.
Hello.
Terry, please
let me tell him.
Oh, no. No.
I'll go get him.
No, please.
Please, Ken.
It's pretty rough.
The first time you're
able to get out
and you have
to run into him.
And all I could say
was "Hello."
Well, the show's over.
Boy got the girl.
Shall we go?
I'll only be a minute.
Yes.
Good night, Lois,
and thank you.
Taking you to
a show tonight
wasn't a very
good idea, was it?
Merry Christmas, Lois.
Merry Christmas, Nickie,
and auf Wiedersehen.
Oh, I think it's terrible
to have to take you home
just when
everyone else
is going out.
C'est la vie,
et cetera.
Terry, let me
ask you again.
Why won't you
let me help you?
All right then,
I will tell you again.
Now, if you paid
for my getting well,
he wouldn't like it
and if he didn't like it,
I wouldn't like it.
Then if you did
get me well,
and I went to him,
you wouldn't like it.
But certainly
he ought to know.
No, because
if he found out,
he'd insist upon
doing it himself
if he had the money,
which I doubt.
And then if I
didn't get well...
Ooh! That'd be awful.
No, unless I can
walk to him,
and when I say walk,
I mean run,
he'll never know.
Well, I'm fine.
I've got my job,
and I'm on a budget.
If things come out right,
and then maybe if
I'm a very good girl,
I'll get what I want
next Christmas.
Follow?
Merry Christmas.
CHILDREN: Merry Christmas.
How are you feeling,
Miss McKay?
Children, I have
bad news for you.
Doctor won't let me
go with you.
ALL: Oh!
Doctor, I could be back
in a couple of hours.
This is the Christmas
benefit.
This is their first
public appearance.
This is my team.
She's our coach, Doc.
Norman, Doctor.
She's our coach,
Doctor.
If it wasn't good for her,
you wouldn't want
her to go, would you?
CHILDREN: No!
Well, look,
why don't you try it
without me, hmm?
Mmm. Come on.
The only thing
that would bother you
would be the start.
Miss McKay?
Yes, Tyrone?
We'll be
thinking about you
while we're singing,
hoping that you'll be
around okay real soon.
Oh, thank you, Tyrone.
Wait a minute.
Where's Sally?
Isn't she with us today?
We took her off the team.
She sings too loud.
She's a show-off.
McGRATH: Sally thought
it was a joke,
and she wanted so badly
to go on the stage.
Oh.
You come here,
darling.
Now, you go
right up on the stage
with the rest of them.
I'll put you back
on the team,
but you must promise
not to drown out
the other children.
All right, Miss McKay.
Now, are we ready?
CHILDREN: Yes.
All right.
ALL:
There's a wonderful place
Called Tomorrow Land
Tomorrow Land
And it's only a dream away
Away
And the moment you get
To Tomorrow Land
Tomorrow Land
You'll forget all about
Today
Today
You'll be walking
on clouds
You'll forget every care
And your troubles like bubbles
Will vanish in air
Ask me how do you get
To Tomorrow Land
Tomorrow Land
Close your eyes, make a wish
And you're there
Close your eyes
Make a wish
And you're
There
You're going to do
all right without me.
All right, children.
We must go now.
Good-bye, Terry.
Good-bye, Father.
Good-bye, darling.
Run along.
Merry Christmas!
Bless you.
Be good now.
Oh.
Merry Christmas!
Oh! Merry Christmas,
darling!
Merry Christmas!
This isn't going to
be much of a Christmas
for you, is it?
Oh, I'll be all right.
There we are.
Could you just
hand me my...
Yes, surely.
Thank you so much.
You're...
You're welcome
to have turkey with
my husband and me.
Oh, you save
a drumstick for me
for later, will you?
All right, I will.
And if there's
anything else you want,
just holler.
Thank you so much.
I will.
It was very sweet of you.
Merry Christmas.
And a merry Christmas
to you, too.
Does Miss McKay...
Nickie?
Hello, Terry.
Oh,
it's good to see you.
Oh, it's good
to see you, too.
You feeling all right?
Yes.
Yes. I'm fine.
I'm just resting.
Good, good. Good.
Well, it's been
a long time.
Yes, hasn't it?
Well, it is good
to see you.
You said that.
May I...
Oh, yes, please, do.
Sit down.
I'll only be a minute.
I'm sure you don't mind.
No, no, of course not.
Oh, is this
the breathtaking view?
Well, the altitude
bothered me.
Yeah, yeah.
Well, I'll bet
you're wondering
how I got here.
Well, yes.
Yes, yes, I am.
Well, I was looking
through a telephone book
for a man named McBride.
And I came across
the name T. McKay.
And I said to myself,
"Now, could that
possibly be Terry McKay,
my old friend?"
And it was.
Yes, yes.
And then I said
to myself,
"Well, now, I haven't been
very nice to Miss McKay.
"After all,
I had an appointment
"with her one day,
and I didn't keep it."
You didn't keep...
No.
Well, so I said
to myself,
I talk to myself
quite a lot these days,
I said, "Well, that's
not a very nice way
"to treat an old friend
like Miss McKay.
"I must apologize
to Miss McKay."
Don't you agree
when someone doesn't
keep an appointment
they should apologize,
hmm?
Yes. Oh, yes, I think
you're absolutely right.
I... Well, I think
the least people could do
is to say they're
sorry or something.
So here I am.
That's very sweet.
I thought so.
I've often wondered
about you.
And how you were.
Did you really?
Yes, really.
Well, I've often
thought about you, too.
Then you weren't angry
because I wasn't there?
I mean, you must
have been at first.
Well, yes.
Yes, yes, I was.
At first,
I was furious.
I said,
"He can't do this to me.
Who does he think he is?"
Hmm. How long
did you wait?
I mean,
did you wait long?
Well, let's...
Well, yes. Yes,
I waited until about...
Midnight.
Oh.
And then what
did you do?
Well, then I got
really mad. Mmm.
Well, you can imagine,
standing up there
on the...
Yes, in a thunderstorm.
In a thunderstorm.
Then what did you
say to yourself?
Well, then I said,
"Go on home
and get tight."
But you didn't
do that.
Didn't I?
No. Well...
Maybe just
a little one
every hour
for about a month.
Can you blame me?
Oh, I should say not.
The least I could have done
was to have sent you a note.
Well, perhaps
by the time
you thought of it,
you didn't know
where to reach me.
But you swore if you ever
saw me again you'd ask.
No. No.
I remember we said
that if we could make it,
we'd be there.
And if one of us
didn't show up,
it would be for
a darn good reason.
Did we say that?
Yes, that is exactly
what we said.
Well, like what
for instance?
So, there'll be no more
questions asked, I hope?
Would you like
a cigarette?
Thank you.
Thank you, Nickie.
Isn't that wonderful?
I walked all
the way here just to...
And now I'm not even
supposed to ask you
why you weren't there.
Isn't it strange?
We used to read
each other's thoughts.
It's not the same,
is it?
Not quite.
Hmm.
It doesn't seem...
I know.
I don't know
what happens to me.
Whenever I...
No wedding ring, I see.
No.
Well, I thought
at the...
Last night, the show?
No, no.
He was just...
No.
I didn't mean
to offend you.
How's everything
with you, Nickie?
Oh, you can
ask questions?
Mmm-hmm.
Well, I thought
everything was fine
until I saw you
last night.
Then I knew there must
be something between us,
even if it's
only an ocean,
so I bought myself
a ticket.
Oh, you're sailing?
Tonight.
And you're happy,
aren't you?
Yes, yes.
And you?
I don't know.
I'm worried
about the future.
I don't know what
people will think.
They'll say,
"There he goes,
the mad painter.
"There's something
the matter with him.
He doesn't like women."
Why would people
say that?
Why?
Because he sails
the seven seas
and to every woman
he meets he says,
"Where will you be
in six months?"
And they're there?
Everywhere.
Tops of pyramids,
the domes of cathedrals,
the Eiffel Tower.
He still tries to
keep them up high.
He keeps them waiting.
Sure. Waiting,
waiting, waiting.
And where is he
all this time?
Waiting.
But you can't go on
like that.
It isn't right for you.
I wish I could say
you were wrong.
I was once.
How'd you like to
change the subject?
Yes, yes, I'd love to.
Merry Christmas.
Oh, I almost forgot.
Now, six months ago,
who'd have thought
we'd be spending
Christmas together
in front of
a nice warm fire?
I brought you a present.
Oh, thank you. I'm sorry.
I don't have one for you.
I didn't think
I'd be seeing you.
That's all right.
I didn't expect one.
That isn't really
a Christmas present.
Oh, that's why
my letters came back.
I would have
sent it to you,
but I didn't know
your address until today.
She wanted you to
have it, remember?
So, well,
that's the reason I...
Good-bye, Terry.
Good-bye, Nickie.
You know, I painted you
like that with the shawl.
I wish you could
have seen it.
Courbet said it was
one of my best.
I didn't think I could
ever part with it.
But, well,
there was no reason to
keep it any longer, and...
I couldn't take money for it,
because, well, you know...
So, Courbet told me
a young woman
came into the gallery,
and she liked it.
She saw in it what
I'd hoped you'd see,
so I told Courbet
to give it to her
because he said
she didn't have
any money,
and not only that,
she was...
She was...
Anyway, I told him
to give it to her.
Courbet said
she wanted it
so badly
and so I told him
to give it to her.
You know,
it's the Christmas season
and all that.
And you know me.
Holly in my heart.
Darling, don't look
at me like that.
Why didn't you tell me?
If it had to
happen to one of us,
why did it have
to be you?
Oh.
It was nobody's fault,
but my own.
I was looking up.
It was the nearest thing
to heaven.
You were there.
Oh, darling, don't...
Don't worry, darling.
If you can paint,
I can walk.
Anything can happen.
Don't you think?
Yes, darling, yes.
Yes, yes, yes.
CHORUS:
Our love affair
