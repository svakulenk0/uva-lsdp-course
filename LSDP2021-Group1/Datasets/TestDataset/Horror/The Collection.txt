Elena
I know this day's like your darkest
day of your life
I know you miss your mother
And even though she's not here right now,
she'll always love you
You understand that, don't you darling?
Yes, Daddy
But i'm going to be around more,
I will always be here
Promise?
I promise
Trap his victims
People still missing
going murderous
vicious crime spree
we'll dedicating every availabe research to hunt this man down
The Collection
the serial killer has claim to yet another victim
And what is becomes the most vicious crime spree in our city history
this unpleasant series of violent murders
has many stayings in doors and living
in fear
Good morning.
I think we can share it this time
The serial killer can traps his victims at home,
business and work places
And kills them
however,it appears that he takes one victim from each
crime scene,this people may be still alive or captive
More over fifty people
still missing
grieving families are seeking answers
and the authorities have began
the man hunt
that's why people wonders in the string of murders
the killer seems to strike without any pattern
which make it impossible
for police to track his moves
it's best to described it's a predator without boundries
targeting men,women,
children, young, old
he does not discriminate
The last missing person is no stranger to crime himself
Arkin O'Brien,is a twice convicted flee
who is abducted shortly after
paramedic responded to a 911 call
O'Brien's wife, Lisa, recently
reacted to the abduction
whoever's watching this
Please, if you see this and you have him
Please let him go.
Please ...
let him go.
We'll hunt this man down,
we'll hunt his trail
and we will bring him to justice
