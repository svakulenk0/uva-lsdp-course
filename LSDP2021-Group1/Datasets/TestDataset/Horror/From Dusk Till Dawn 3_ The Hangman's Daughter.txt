Take it off. My bulletts speed if
by head I wanna spite name on it.
The blood of many brave men have
been shared on that wall.
It will give you some comfort
to share in their glory.
- I accept that honour.
- The honour is mine.
- The last words?
- Death is the end of pain.
The last pain.
Death is the end of pain.
It's a man enough gun you got there, sir
Is that...?
- I won't gonna steal it or nothing,
I just want to see it up close.
- Is this close enough?
Yes,sir.
Yeah, you got out of here, cabron!
He's been hanging around here in the
last couple of days and not drinkin' a din.
- Brandy.
- It's no brandy, sir.
- Whisky.
- Right.
Pass the Lord for forgiveness, he'll save
your soul. Would you like a prayer sheet?
- So, you are here for the hanging?
- No. I have other business.
Stick around?
Here, in Bagatoria was big entertainment.
Open your heart to the kingdom of heaven
there is a seat for you by his throne.
Pass God for forgive you and he will.
Would you like a prayer sheet?
- I don't want to be here when it happens.
How soon to they're ready?
I'll go and see.
Has Villa a ridden through here?
East side of you. Why?
I've something very valuable.
Well, the best place to track in is Tierra Negra.
It's a bit of days ride from here,
but it's rough country, bad lands.
Travellers like you might not want to go alone.
- Really?
It's better you travel with company. That
stedickles there is going that direction.
Senor! A lot of white folks go miss in these parts.
Can I ask your name in case someone came looking?
Bierce. Ambrose Bierce.
And no one will come looking.
Brother! Can I offer you a
life and a resurrection?
My name is John Newlie.
Bierce. Ambrose Bierce.
Guess we are travelling together.
-Really?
Who gets the fare?
He has no tongue. I'm his
voice, he is my eyes.
You are safe with us.
I'm filled with confidence.
Die! Die!
I know you.
Madrid. Look at me Madrid.
Look at me!
Look in the eyes that will watch
you swinging from that rope,
my ears will hear the crack
of your neck breaking,
my nose will smell the
shit in your pants,
and my mouth will laugh when you die.
Hold him!
Esmeralda! What are you
doing here? Go home!
I won't tell you again!
I want to see it.
You dare to disobey me now?
Even to my face?
Bring her!
No! No!
She is your daughter.
Your own flesh and blood.
Any last words?
See you in hell.
That one has a devil on the side.
Esmeralda.
She is your daughter! What are
you doing?  You could kill her!
I'd rather see her dead!
Go get the horses!
Is something the matter John?
No, what'd I thought I left the Bibles.
But here they are!
Thank Godness! We can't start a
Bible school in tierra Negra without Bibles!
Perhaps Mr. Bierce would like one.
Oh no, no thank you. I've already read it.
You have.
Nice thing of the good book is
that it covers too far apart.
Excuse me?
I'm on the opinion that the Bible is perhaps
the greatest assemblage of lies and
untruth ever gathered together. A possible
exception is the Congressional Record.
- Are you an atheist, sir? - Yes ma'am.
Thanks to your god. I'm an atheist.
There's no hope for your soul on the final day,
when Gabriel blows his horn
your ears will be deaf to the resounding
tone of its glory, Mr. Bierce.
Oh, no. On the contrary, when Gabriel
blows his horn, I'd be playing the tuba.
It won't feel us bad, Mary. Mr. Bierce
is entitled to his beliefs so deeply.
How generous!
- So why are you here, Mr. Bierce?
- I have an ambassador good will.
All right. And an ambassador to whom?
General Fransico Vien.
- The...the revolutionary?
- One and the same.
And I meet him tomorrow in Tierra
Negra. I'm in charged with the
duty to transport somthing
of incredible value to him.
- What is it?
I'm afraid of if I shared this
information with you madam,
It would be forced to take your life and
I wouldn't want that on my conscience.
He is joking honey,
he is joking.
Johnny!
Where where you, Mickey?
I thought... we... Chato said...
What did Chato say?!
He said... he said... he said
that he was the new heffe.
Where is Chato?
Get him!
All the things they say about you...
I don't believe them.
Believe them.
But you took me away. You have me.
I thought you would keep them
shooting at me. But I was wrong.
- Where would we go?
- Say that again!
- Where would we go?
- What do you mean, 'we'?
- You got that way, and I go this way.
- But you... - No more words!
You can hit me if you want!
Yeah, turn around!
Keep smearing harm.
- Don't you have any relatives
you can go to? - No.
- What about your mother?
- She died when I was born.
My father told it I stole my
first breath from her last one.
You can ride with me to Tierra Negra.
I know someone there.
- He can set you up with some food and work.
- What kind of work?
Kind of work girls do.
- I don't think I'm that kind of girl.
- All girls are that kind of girl.
Well, about two hours or so.
They headed east.
Go back to town find all the men you can.
Tell them I pay 100 pesos who ever
brings Esmeralda back to me alive.
Are you talking to me?
Are you really talking to me?
- What's this?
- I don't mean any harm, all right?
I want to be your prenis.
Look! My doors swing only one way: OUT!
No no no...
It's a student! I want you to teach me!
I want to be a real outlaw.
A legend like you.
You want us to kill him for you?
Kill her!
I shot that thing clean off and
I will do the the same with your tereso!
- You shot that rope?
- Take me on and let me learn!
I'm not gonna mess up.
So you are proving.
Mains Reece. When do we start?
Lesson number one: I ask questions and
you answer them, ok? Give me your gun!
Lesson number two: never give your gun to nobody.
- Lesson number three: we don't like gringos!
- I know a gringo we can hit!
Talk!
- An old man is carrying
something to Pancho Villa - What?
- I...I don't know. It must be very valuable.
- She is lying!
I sware to God! It could be guns
and it could be gold!
Very good job.
Very good job! But if you are fucking with
me you will be in a wooden box,
understand? Good for you!
Mr. Bierce, you are sick!
Now this is a sign to stop your drinking.
They say when a man drinks, it develops certain powers.
- What kind of powers?
- Cleurboids.
Second sight.
My wife is right, Mr. Bierce.
You'd better take care of yourself.
This is a preservative, and I'm pickling
myself for your great beyond.
What did he say exactly?
He said he was carrying something for
via. Something that worths a lot.
If you lie, you die, understand?
This little difficult experition:
Who foots the bill?
We don't have to listen to this.
My father died recently, Mr. Bierce.
He left me a large sum of money,
and I decided to use it for the low.
Ah, so he not only gained a bride,
but a checkbook to in the bargon.
You insinuate that I married
my wife for her money.
We have scrooped with Mr. Bierce. Something
you must have lost if you ever had'em.
With that shotgun, he is blind!
- What the...  who is that?
- Bandits, no doubt.
- Damn! They gonna rob us!
- Kill us too, most likely.
Bastard!
Joaquin, the driver!
I got him!
Mr. Bierce! Stop it!
Stop it now!
Move!
- Which one of you shot me?!
- He.
That's him!
Thank you.
Find the gold!
Reece! Over there!
- Look what you did to my friend, gringo.
- My liquor, give it back.
- Mr. Bierce!
- That hurt, don't it, ha?
- May I assist you or something...?
- What's the matter with you, ha?
- We gonna get 50 pesos for that. Real silk.
- My wedding dress!
The gold! I said find the gold!
- Hey, Chefe!
- There's nothing secret...
- What's in the box, senora?
- There are Bibles...
- I wasn't talking to you.
There are Bibles for the
children of Tierra Negra.
- A Biblia Santa.
- Where is the gold?
- I found something!
- You said he had two cases of gold.
- No Madrid, I said that it could've been gold.
You got something very valuable
for Villa. What is it?
- Shoot me!
- No! Please!
Go on! Squeeze the trigger.
You can do it.
Just tell them what it is , Mr. Bierce! Let
them take it, it's not worth your life!
- It's not worth your life.
- It is my life.
- What? - It is me. I'm going to be
a soldier in Villa...in the revolution.
Crazy old gringo! What are we
to take you, ha? Look at you!
- Let me kill him at once!
- Leave him alone! He is an honorable man.
I'd like to thank you, Mr. Bierce. With all your
provato you nearly got us killed back there.
- Don't you lay another finger on my husband!
- I'm sick of the sight of him.
- You have no right to speak like this! We are alive...
- We are alive! What are you living for?
This sick, offending...
John! Leave him alone! Get off of him!
- You still have simpathy for
him even after that?
- I fault the sin and not the sinner John, he needs help.
- Bring on!
- When do the lessons start? - The lessons are
all around you all the time. Remember that.
The earth, it's opened up for
you like a woman.
- Was it hard to kill all those men?
- No it wasn't, was it Madrid?
For an outlaw, it's easy. An outlaw
is ready to kill no matter what.
Listen, tell me your technique.
You know, how you done it.
Was it sneaking upon people or
did you do a run to their face?
Madrid, how did you became
famous, like a legend?
- Is that what you want? To be a legend?
- I want to be an outlaw. And that means famous.
People know your name and
they're scared of it.
They tell their children to watch out at night,
because you could coming
at night and kill the in their cribs.
Men fear you and women scream at the sight of you.
- That's what I want.
- Yeah? Is that what you think I am?
- Of course that's what you are.
You are a monster. You are lying to yourself
if you're  think you're any different.
- John! Is something wrong?
- Wagon stuck.
We're not gonna make it throgh the sand.
We walk a while. It'll be fine.
I know you!
- Why are we stopping? I don't like cementeries.
- This is for the kid.
Reece! Do you want to be like me? This is what you learn.
The secret for becoming an outlaw, a legend, is fear.
To make the people scared of you?
The only way to know how to put fear into
someone else is for you to feel that fear.
- Feel it and face it. Can you do that?
- Yeah, I can try.
- Try?
- I mean yeah, I can do it.
- What are you doing?
- What's the lesson number one?
- You ask the questions.
- Get up on the cross! Move!
- Put the noose around your neck.
- Johnny, I don't think...
Do you want to learn, ha? You want to be an outlaw, a legend.
You got to be able to step fear in the face!
Smell it's breath and laugh.
If you can't do that...than forget it.
- Johnny, please!
- Shut up!
- Is that better?
- It isn't now.
- Are you scared?
- No.
- Johnny!
- How about now?
- Yes.
- Do you feel that rope is getting tighter around your neck?
- Yes.- Johnny! Stop it!- Hey!
- Do you think you must slip and fall?
- Yes.
You feel like a horse's ass, ha?
Because that's what you look like; a horse's ass!
Don't laugh at me! Don't laugh at me!
You see, we're looking at you
and you don't look like a legend.
- You look like...like... Joaquin,
what she looks like? - A horse's ass!
- Don't fucking laugh at me!
- Johnny that's enough!
- You can't kill her! She is a girl.
- She is an outlaw. And she'll die like an outlaw.
You're on your way now, kid.
A little while, you'll be a legend.
Esmeralda! Wait!
- Come on! - See we don't mean nothing you ask chefe, you
chase after her. We're going on to Tierra Negra.
"La Tetilla del Diablo".
Now what does that mean?
I believe I can translate that for you.
Welcome home, wearied pilgrims.
Inkeeper!
- We'are closed.
- You speak English!
- English, French Latin and Nahuatl.
- We'd like a room for the night, sir.
- And I'd like some brandy.
- All night?
- Yes.
Uno peso.
- Drink?
- Yeah, sure.
Two glasses of milk, please.
- Water, then.
- Tequila!
That's my cure . Have two bottles of your finest, thank you.
- I think we have some water in the back. The kind with the bubbles?
- Yeah, I know.
- Anything, please.
- Make yourselves comfortable.
- We'll busy here for a couple of hours.
- Thank you.
Esmeralda! Wait!
What's the matter? You didn't
even know that kid.
- She made you angry?
- She had the wrong idea about me.
- What's gonna happen to me when I make you angry, ha?
- You don't make me angry.
What if I say the wrong thing? Sometimes
I just looked at my father and he hit me.
I'm sorry.
- More?
- No. We'd like to see our rooms, please.
I'm Quixsla. I'll show you to your room.
- John Newlie.
- John.
- And she is...
- My wife. Mrs. Mary Newlie.
Hello.
Madrid did this.
He'll have to stop. They cannot ride in the dark, there are coyotes out.
The closest pueblo is another half days journey.
- There's no place to stop out here.
- There's one place.
She is still alive!
Kill him! Kill him!
You have no idea what you've unleashed!
Bring her!
I have a shot of your best.
Damn lucky thing I found this place.
I saw a dead meandering in the dusk and dawn.
I was wondering... which do you call
when someone looks real but it ain't?
- A mirage.
- Yes sir, that's it, a mirage... the real thing.
Uh, that's good, yeah, it'a real good.
I think I have another one.
Pay for the first one.
You know...I ain't got damn money... but I do
have some much better than that.
- It's a brush!
- Well, yeah, technically speaking it's a brush,
but this brush was made by the finest Andalusian
group, bristles handpicked by Andalusian gypsies
straight of the mane of Andalusian
horses, going into far of Andalusia.
- We don't need no stinking brushes!
I'll stand the pedlar to a drink.
Still ain't interested in the brush?
That's occupied.
This will be your room.
Call me... if you need anything.
Excuse me madam, what time
can we expect supper?
We eat late around here. But don't
worry, I let you know when it's time.
- Are you all right, dear?
- Yes, I'm fine.
- Need anything?
- Nop, nothing.
Ah, John!
We've been married a week, Mary. And I still
don't know what you look like in a bed dress.
John, I just hope that you have better
reasons for marriage than that.
You know I do! I love you, Mary.
It's not a sin if you married in love.
I'm not refusing you because I think it's a sin.
It's just that...that...
It's a bat. Just a bat. Tried to
find some shade from the heat.
- Are you sure you all right?
- I feel sick.
I just want to go to bed.
Could you possibly get me some water?
All right Mary, I  get you some water.
I'll be back.
Son of a bitch!
- Are you looking for something?
No I... I dropped something.
Maybe it's in here.
You like the dress? You want it?
You can have it. For 50 pesos!
Here are a lot of ladies.
There's a lot of dirt down here, in Mexico,
I make a kill instead of brushes and boom,
but Tierra Negra was my last hope, if I
don't sell last it's back home for me.
We begged a ticket up in threed, barter system
or something if you get my drift listed.
- Sorry mister, I ain't asked your name.
- Bierce, Ambrose.
- Ambrose Bierce you, right?
- Yes.
- That don't be true.
- You know my work?
Yes sir, I do.
I did read...let me see...
The story with that soldier up on that bridge set to be hanged,
and he escapes far into the river below
He swam, he swam he swam, ran to his
house and kiss his wife,
snap, his neck broke and all went to dream.
It's a got damn dream. That'd just kill me.
Excuse me! Drink!
- Water?
- No. Tequila.
Keep it coming!
My name is Newlie. John Newlie.
I like your friend.
Never seen this place before. I must've
ridden through here a thousand times.
- Maybe we'd go to Tierra Negra.
- It's dark. The coyotes are out. We'll be safer in here.
You are very pretty, senorita.
- Go inside. I take your horses.
- Yeah, you'd better do that.
Go on! I'm gonna make sure that
the horses are taken care of.
We don't want to get stuck here. I'll be right back.
You're alone?
- Who hurt you?
- The scars on your back. Your husband?
- No. My father.
You sweet child.
It's tears, have never fallen on the mother's breast.
- You are very special... Esmeralda.
- How do you know my name?
Hey idiot! Where are you?
- Hey! What are you doing?
- Nothing, senior.
- Get away from my horse!
- Si, senior.
John!
Well, well. Remember me?
- Where's the girl?
- Which one?
I mean a specified girl. The one that
just came in here. Where's she?
Hey! Where's the girl? I'm talking to you!
So what's your policy on fighting
in this establishment?
I don't care. What do you have in mind?
I'm talking about real ass-kicking; broken arms,
smashed nose shattered jaw, that's what I think.
I've seen worse, senior.
- Tequila!
- Si, senior.
- What do I owe you?
- Jetted jaw right here!
Please, senior...
- Esmeralda, we're leaving!
- I want to stay!
This is not the time to fuck around!
- She said she's staying.
- I'm not talking to you!
- Get out of the way or I blow you an extra hole!
- Go ahead!
- John!
- Let him go, or I fix your little bitch, cabron!
You're next, asshole!
John!
John, stop it!
- Something wrong?
- What's the matter with this place?
- Your stupid friend ate my horse! I had to shoot him.
- You mean Nano?
I know what you look like Madrid:
you look like the horse's ass!
Esmeralda!
- Mary!
- John!
I'm walking out of here,
and I'm taking Esmeralda with me!
You've taken far enough, Madrid.
You don't know what you're getting into!
Give her back to me now, and I let you live!
You're not going anywhere! You stay with me!
Well Mauricio, it's been a long  time.
But I knew you come back.
Stay away from me!
The girl is beautiful.
She does really look like you.
- Stay away from me!
- But she looks a lot like me!
Hey Mauricio! After all these years, where've
you been, amigo? You're just in time for dinner!
Fuck!
Oh Jesus!
Mauricio! That wasn't very nice!
Let's get out of here!
Let's go honey! Let's go!
Back!
Mary! Mary!
Cabron!
John help me! John!
Get a dance!
Mary!
Mary!
Mary!
Mary! No!
Down here!
Go! Go! Move back! Move back!
Shut the door! Shut the door!
- Because of you they took my wife!
- They should have taken you, pendejo!
That's enough!
No it isn't!
- I said that's enough!
- It's none of your business, gringo!
He put my daughter into this area.
Everyone here has a score dissent.
And if we were in anywhere else,
I wouldn't give too annal explosions if you blew
your stinking brains into a flatulented wink.
But from now on the bets are off.
Am I clear? Am I clear!?
It's her they want.
Till we have her we have a chance.
- My daughter is not for sale!
- Did I say that?
Let's find another way out.
- You'd better watch your back, hangman.
- Watch yours.
Get up! Get up!
Wait! They're gone!
- Esmeralda!
- There's something in my hair!
Where's my girl?
You must find her.
You have to taste what I've tasted.
She has arrived!
Wake the old one!
John!
John!
My Lord in heaven!
John! How could you leave me up there?
I'm your wife, John!
They hurt me!
- Mary!
- This is not your wife, Newlie.
- Shut your mouth, Bierce!
He is no servant of God!
He talkes a good game.
But deep down he is a sinner!
Child of Sodom!
- Stop it!
- Send her to the hell, she is
so formerly feared when in sermon.
Now what kind of preacher would
defy his god so blasphemously!?
The game is up you cocksucker!
All this time, you've been selling
your sale as a devoted believer!
Now you are as a sinful thief!
You counted me what for?
oh you really wanted to do
was to take my father's money.
Blasphemour!
Fucking pendejo!
You always wanted to see what was
underneath this dress, didn't you?
Help me! Help me!
John, how could you?
Forgive me!
Was anyone else beaten back there?
- No I wasn't.
- No, not me.
No.
Everybody's fine? All right then,
we're safe. Let's move on.
Make god forgive and help all of us.
Here feels colder.
Nightair.
This must be the way out.
Could be that way, could be this way, idiot!
We will separate.
Take our chances.
You! You take the girl,
your friend, and the believer.
I take the hangman and the kid.
And try not to kill each other!
God forgotten about you, Reece.
- Reece. Katherine Reece. - No.
- You're wanted for murder in two states I believe.
See you read papers.
I'm a journalist. She sent her
entire family to the great beyond.
Killed them in cold blood in Oklahoma.
Then went on to Texas,
where she proferred the same gift to
her aunt, her unkle and five cousins.
- Six.
- Oh, six. Pardon me.
You killed your mother and father? Why?
They were starving, there's no food.
So I sent them to a better place.
What about your aunt and
unkle and all your cousins?
I never liked them.
What the fuck are you looking at, pendejo?
Trouble! Hey! Where's your friend?
Joaquin!
Quit fucking around, Joaquin! Joaquin!
Joaquin!
You made me one of them!
You turned me into one of those things!
What? What are you gonna do?
- Do it for turning!
- God have mercy in your soul, compadre.
What's going on? Where are the others?
- Dead.
- Dead? Why not you?
Maybe you are one of them. A bloodsucker.
You know about bloodsucking, wouldn't you?
What's that supposed to mean?
... the girl... the princess...
Pappy! Why do they want me? Who am I?
Why don't you tell her?
What are you talking about?
Tell her who her mother is. Tell her!
If you cannot succeed in killing one another
I release you so could do it upon that god damn door!
Come! There's somebody that I want you to meet.
This is your grandmother.
Welcome home Santánico.
- Prepare these sacrifices for the annuity.
- Nooo!
It's really quite an extraordinarily,
compromising position.
What are they fixing to do with us?
Lead us dry.
Hangman, your past has come back to haunt us.
I tried to do the best I could.
I raised her in my own home for 19 years.
And I beat her so she
would never disobey me.
I never thought she would come
back to her mother.
The old woman... she predicted this;
Esmeralda would return to Tetilla des Diablo.
As only she was kept from this place she
said she would remain a human, just a girl.
Coming here she becomes something else.
- You should've kill her.
- I tried... she was a child. But she kept coming back.
We taste of your blood that
we join us Santànico Pandemonium.
Psst! Hangman!
Welcome to the darkness Santanico Pandemonium!
Send her to her rest!
I'm here, pappy!
I'm home, pappy.
No. I raised you, not your mother! I raised you!
- I know, pappy.
- I never wanted to punish you.
I know. Pappy! I love you!
Out of here!
Johnny wait!
Get away from me.
But you brought me here.
To the place I belong. It's safe here.
What are you talking about, Esmeralda!?
She is not Esmeralda!
She is Santanico!
Bitch!
Johnny! Don't leave me! Johnny!
Hey! What are you gonna do now?
What I came here to do.
Hey!
Do you need company?
Not particulary, no.
But Villa might.
