Edward.
Edward!
- Pretorious.
- PRETORIOUS: Go away.
Now, listen to me. I've gotta talk to you.
The Resonator, it's working.
- Lf this is your idea of a joke...
- No, listen to me.
The new program, it worked.
Just like you said.
My God.
Do you feel it, Crawford?
Turn it off. Edward, shut it off.
Never.
Can't you feel it?
Crawford. In the mind.
The... The mind.
It's out of control. You've got to turn it off.
No. No.
No, I wanna see more.
More than any man has ever seen.
Edward, it's running itself.
Something's coming.
They're at it again,
with the colored lights
and the weird sounds.
Last time I called,
you said you'd send a squad car
if there was another disturbance.
Well, I'm disturbed.
Hello?
Hello! Oh!
Bunny, come back.
Bunny.
Bunny.
Oh, please.
Bunny.
Bunny.
Get back!
Bunny.
Get back! It's out of control!
Someone! Turn it off!
Somebody help!
Hold it, fella.
Oh, God.
Oh, my God.
COP: Come on. Come on.
Bunny. Oh.
Dr. Bloch, I'm Jordan Fields
from the DA's office.
- This is Dr. Katherine McMichaels.
- Hello.
I've read some of your work.
Very impressive.
Oh, well, yes. So is this facility.
Though, if you've read my work,
you know I'm not in favor
of locking away schizophrenics.
Yes, I know.
You're in favor of using them
in experiments like lab animals.
We've asked Dr. McMichaels
for her expert opinion
on the sanity of Crawford Tillinghast,
as it pertains to his ability to stand trial
for the murder of Edward Pretorious.
Thank you.
Just a minute. Ray.
Oh, here.
Thank you.
- And...
- Oh.
Thank you.
PATIENT: Help me.
I'm sorry, Lord. I have sinned.
I'm sorry, Lord.
Forgive me, God in heaven.
Forgive me.
Get them out of here!
Get them out of here!
Get them out of here!
He's in here, Doctor.
BLOCH: Crawford.
This is Dr. Katherine McMichaels.
Hello.
I suppose you're another psychiatrist.
- Yes, I am.
- Uh-huh.
And you're a physicist.
Your record at Miskatonic University
was brilliant.
Ah, yes. I had quite a future, didn't I?
Yes, you were working
with Edward Pretorious.
I was assisting Dr. Pretorious
with his experiments, yes.
What was the purpose
of the experiments?
To stimulate the pineal gland
with resonant vibrations.
The pineal gland. Why?
Dr. Pretorious believed that the pineal
was a dormant sensory organ.
- A sixth sense.
- Yes.
Well, that's not a new theory.
The philosopher Descartes
believed it was the third eye.
It's not a theory, it's a fact.
Then your experiments worked.
They proved the theory.
Yes.
Then what went wrong?
Nothing, at first.
But then we saw them.
What did you see?
We saw creatures.
We saw creatures. These
things that are swimming around in the air
and fill it all the time.
- Are they around us now?
- You bet.
Only we can't see them
without the Resonator,
and they can't see us
unless they're under the influence
of the vibrations.
That's why I had to destroy it.
- Destroy what?
- The Resonator. Pretorious' invention.
Because...
Because...
It... came.
What came?
Dr. Tillinghast?
Crawford, what did you see?
It ate him.
Bit off his head.
Like a gingerbread man.
BLOCH: Crawford!
Dr. McMichaels.
I'm not mad. I saw it.
I saw it!
CRAWFORD: Do you hear me? I saw it.
- Why doesn't anyone believe me?
- We can't reach him.
- Why doesn't anyone believe me?
- He keeps returning to the same fantasies.
Let's do a CAT scan on him.
Why?
You've already seen everything
you need to see.
There's always more to see.
- No machines, please.
- No, it's all right.
It'll be all right.
I promise.
Okay.
Oh, God. No. No.
No. No! No!
No!
No!
Oh, my God.
- There, do you see that?
- BLOCH: Mmm-hmm.
The pineal gland is oversized
and extending through the optic thalami.
Think the tumor is causing his delusions?
I don't think that's a tumor.
I think the pineal gland is growing.
That's impossible.
I know, but the CAT scan bears it out.
The pineal stalk
is elongating through the brain.
Wait a minute.
I don't know from the inside of brains.
What does all this mean?
Well, it... It could mean
that the experiment they were performing
actually does stimulate the pineal.
You mean, he's not crazy?
I don't know.
He actually believes
that he saw these creatures.
That still doesn't explain
how Pretorious died,
or what happened to his head.
I'd like to recreate their experiment
and I'll need Tillinghast to do it.
That is absurd and unethical.
I know your methods.
The girl wonder.
You use your patients
so you can make your great discoveries.
At least here we try to cure them.
By locking them up,
giving them drugs,
taking their lives away?
I can give him his life back.
I'll give you an expert opinion.
Crawford Tillinghast
is a classic paranoid schizophrenic
and a dangerous one.
If I can recreate the experiment,
then I can find out
what happened to Pretorious.
I'd like nothing better
than to lock this guy up.
I've got a dead man
with his head twisted off
covered in some shit
the pathologist can't even identify.
No other fingerprints found
except Tillinghast's,
no blood on the ax, no blood anywhere.
I wanna know
what the hell happened up there.
He's all yours.
You're my patient now, Dr. Tillinghast.
Thank you.
I'll call for an appointment.
No, no, no, wait a minute.
You've been released into my custody.
You'll have to come with me.
Where do you plan on taking me?
Back to the Pretorious house.
I want you to recreate your experiment.
No.
Look, you can either stay here
for the rest of your life,
or you can come with me.
That's not much of a choice, is it?
I believe you, Crawford.
I wanna see what you saw.
Hi. You must be Dr. McMichaels.
No, I'm Dr. McMichaels.
- Oh, hi.
- Hello.
- Then you must be...
- This is Dr. Crawford Tillinghast.
The crazy.
I'm Sergeant Buford Brownlee,
but my teammates call me Bubba.
I used to play pro football.
We were all crazy.
Not exactly cheery.
Sorry about that. Childproof lock.
Last stop. Everybody out.
Dr. Tillinghast,
would you care to show us around?
Doctor, if you're telling us the truth,
the only way to free yourself is to go back,
through this door.
Come on, Doc.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
Look, I'll show you.
See, what did I tell you?
- Bubba, you all right?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm okay.
Electrical cables.
We needed more power
so I rewired the whole house.
Where are the circuit breakers, Doctor?
Doctor?
Tillinghast.
Damn it, we lost him.
He knows this place better than we do.
First thing's to find the power.
- Hey, wait a minute.
- What?
I'll bet these cables lead to the Resonator.
First we find our missing mental patient.
This guy was into some weird shit.
That's him.
Dr. Edward Pretorious.
I don't care about his private life.
The Pretorious Resonator.
- Is that how you hacked up Pretorious?
- That's where I hit it.
I knocked a fork off.
There.
There it is.
- What do you want me to do with him?
- Let him go.
- Are you crazy, too?
- He's reliving it, the night of the murder.
Let him go.
DA says you call the signals.
Yes.
Yes.
This is how it was.
That's where it ate him.
Wait a minute, what ate who?
We can start in the morning, Crawford.
I've started.
McMICHAELS: All right.
All this talking about eating
is making me hungry.
How about getting some dinner, huh?
Real danger here is starving.
Pretty, isn't she?
CRAWFORD: She's beautiful.
So how's it going, Doc?
Need some help?
He used to bring beautiful women here.
They'd eat fine meals, drink fine wine,
listen to music.
But it always ended with screaming.
And I would just lie there
and listen to them.
Screaming.
- Your boss had some screws loose.
- He was a genius.
It's just that the five senses
weren't enough for him. He wanted more.
Is it finished?
Are we ready?
Yes.
I had to bypass the computer
because the magnetic field
erased the program.
And, of course,
the monitor is completely useless.
So the entire system
has to be manually operated.
And unfortunately the Resonator
was so severely damaged
that I had to convert it
to just an on/ off system.
When we reach 20,000 megahertz,
we throw this switch,
and a powerful magnetic field vibrates
these forks at a precise frequency.
Stimulating the pineal gland,
allowing us to see with it.
Listen to me.
Don't move when we're in the field
of the vibrations.
- McMICHAELS: Why?
- You move and they may see you.
It will see you.
What is this "it" anyway?
Pray you don't see for yourself.
Now, I'm staying right by this switch.
If it appears, I'm shutting down.
Are you sure we're ready for this?
- Yes.
- CRAWFORD: No, please.
Remember, stay still.
This looks real great, people.
Oh, man.
What the hell is that?
- What?
- I don't know what.
No, don't move.
Holy shit.
- Is this what you saw?
- Yes.
These things are around us all the time.
It's coming.
- Bubba, are you all right?
- No.
Lost a little piece but I'll be fine.
When you move in the field,
it can sense you.
How far does the field extend?
I'm turning it off.
PRETORIOUS: Crawford.
No.
Who is it?
Show yourself.
Welcome home, Crawford.
I'm glad you came back.
Who's the lovely woman?
CRAWFORD: It can't be you.
Dr. Pretorious?
You have me at a disadvantage, my dear.
Crawford, where are your manners?
Bring your friend to me.
I saw you die.
No, not die.
Just pass beyond.
It was horrible.
A necessary rite of passage.
Quite wonderful, in fact.
Where have you been hiding?
Move toward me, my dear.
I want to see you.
- How...
- Did I survive?
I am the master here.
Is it...
Is it really you, Edward?
Is it really you, Edward?
Touch me,
if it pleases you,
if it helps you understand.
It's just the body.
But my mind is indivisible.
Bodies change.
That will be quite enough of that.
I feel exhilarated.
We almost died.
Incredible creature.
It must have total bodily control
on a molecular level.
Yes, and Edward's mind.
He's become the thing that ate him.
Crawford, we saw the same things.
We've proved you're not insane.
- I'm not so sure.
- No.
You faced your fear and you overcame it.
You saved our lives.
BUBBA: Yeah.
I owe you one.
Want some breakfast?
How can you eat after that?
Can't work without eating.
- What work?
- Well, I've got to record the results.
The pineal gland was stimulated.
- It gave me one hell of a headache.
- Expansion of the pineal.
I'll have to do a study
of the CAT scans of schizophrenics.
If there's a statistical correlation
between schizophrenia
and an enlarged pineal,
why, they may be seeing
or feeling what we saw.
Their minds may be influenced
by those creatures.
Well how about the hard-on I got?
Is there a statistical correlation
for that, too?
Well, we know that the pineal gland
helps to regulate the sex drive.
Perhaps pineal stimulation causes
an accompanying sexual stimulation.
There's so much to learn.
Well, we learned what we came for.
He ain't crazy
and that "it" ate Pretorious' head.
They're gonna think we're crazy,
but that's their problem.
Well, we just have to try
the experiment again.
Did you say, "we"?
Katherine, you can't.
You don't mean
go back up there now, do you?
You always run an experiment twice,
to check the results.
Wait, now I saw it get to him, Katherine.
Just exactly what you're feeling,
and it ruined him.
Pretorious.
Yes, I'd like to know more about him.
That Resonator is a work of genius.
Were we in the same nightmare?
I mean, didn't we just almost all
get eaten by an "it"?
All it takes is a hand on the switch.
If it appears, you make it disappear.
I got a better idea.
How about if we disappear out the door?
Don't you understand? This is the
greatest discovery since van Leeuwenhoek
first looked through a microscope
and saw an amoeba.
Yeah, but he wasn't down there
with the amoebas.
I have to find out
if the pineal gland is really the key.
Okay, fine. Fine, but not here, not now.
- Under controlled conditions.
- But we have control.
No one knows that Resonator
better than you do.
You're right.
And that's why no one is touching it.
Crawford.
This could be the first step
in curing schizophrenia.
Crawford.
My father spent 15 years in an institution.
He died in one.
They called his condition incurable.
They tried everything,
drugs, shock therapy, even surgery.
But they turned him into a vegetable.
I'm sorry.
We can save so many others.
Please, Crawford.
We can do it.
- Help me.
- Help you?
Help you to take your mind
and shatter it?
I can't.
And I won't let you. I'm the law here.
You turn on that machine
and it's reckless endangerment.
Look, we all need some rest.
Why don't we just get some sleep,
and then we'll think about it.
Yeah, we'll get some rest,
and then we're going.
Turn it off.
No.
I have to see more.
Feel more.
Turn it off.
No.
No. No.
We've got to stop it.
PRETORIOUS: Oh, don't stop.
I'm impressed, Crawford.
Do you realize now what I was creating?
Edward, my God, what have you become?
Myself.
Get the switch. I'll distract him.
Yes, I do find you distracting.
Don't, Crawford.
Listen to me.
Whatever you are,
you're still Edward Pretorious.
You're still human.
I'm more than human.
Join me forever.
Everyone must join me.
We'll be waiting for you, Crawford.
Where the hell are you going, junior?
The circuit breaker, I've got to turn it off.
Damn it.
Smell.
Taste.
In another life,
I would have enjoyed you in another way.
You messing
with that damn machine again, man?
- What the hell is that?
- The vibrations must reach down here.
I'll be right back.
What are you gonna do to me?
I'm going to kiss you.
I'm sorry.
I really thought that I could control it.
It's changing us, Doc.
All of us.
And not for the better.
I was wrong to turn on the Resonator
with other subjects present.
It's clear now that only one person
should run the experiment.
This ain't an experiment. It's suicide.
The presence of other subjects
causes dangerous distractions.
Now I can stand right at the master switch
and maintain control of that Resonator.
But I must do it myself.
I know this behavior.
I've seen it in the streets.
You may be a scientist, lady,
but right now you're acting like a junkie.
Oh, just take him and leave.
Wrap him up. I'll get the van ready.
Put some clothes on.
Unless you want me to take you
kicking and screaming like that.
What the hell are you doing?
I told you to get dressed.
I did.
The van's ready.
You going like that?
No.
What a shame.
I just
love what you've done with this room.
You're asking for it.
Look at yourself.
Look at yourself.
Is that who you are?
I don't know.
I don't know who I am.
Listen.
- Crawford, we're leaving now.
- No. Listen.
The Resonator.
It's him.
He's trying to start the Resonator
from beyond.
Son of a bitch.
Bastard.
Bubba, pull the cable!
Bubba!
Use the ax, the ax.
Damn.
BUBBA: Oh, no, God.
Oh, God!
Oh, God! Oh!
No!
Bubba!
Katherine.
Crawford!
Kiss.
Kiss, my dear.
Humans are such easy prey.
Let her go.
PRETORIOUS: Oh, I will.
Beyond her wildest dreams.
She will go into my mind
and I will go into hers.
It's the greatest sensual pleasure there is.
You never knew pleasure or gave it,
only pain.
You are evolving
into a being that has never existed before.
I'm Crawford Tillinghast.
Let it happen, Crawford.
CRAWFORD: No.
- Let it out.
- No.
Crawford!
CRAWFORD: Oh, it's so beautiful.
So
beautiful.
Now you can truly see.
What have you done to him?
I only awakened his sleeping pineal gland.
It did the rest itself.
No!
Crawford.
You whore.
Die, you fucker.
Oh, Crawford.
The police are here.
She's been telling us a pretty wild story.
I have been telling you the truth.
We'd like your opinion of her mental state.
I'd rather give you my opinion
of her professional conduct.
You're contemptible.
Look at her.
I doubt she even understands
what she's done.
You cost Crawford Tillinghast his mind,
quite possibly his life.
And another man's life.
That machine has got to be destroyed.
I listened to you the first time
and now I've lost one of my best men.
The DA's gonna chew me a new asshole,
thanks to you.
She's in your custody now.
No, no, no, wait a minute.
You can't lock me up.
Not here. Please.
You can't do much with her
in this agitated state.
She'll upset the other patients.
Do whatever you think best.
Listen, Dr. Bloch, please.
You know that I'm sorry
for everything that I've done.
You have got to let me go back...
Don't you tell me
what I have got to do, girl wonder.
You always have all the answers,
don't you?
Well, you're my patient now.
And I've got a few answers myself.
Prepare her for electroshock therapy.
But, Dr. Bloch, hospital policy says...
Hospital policy dictates
that the nursing staff is to follow orders.
Now, do as I say.
- Yes, Doctor.
- No.
BLOCH: Stop her.
- My God, Bloch, no.
- Set her up in number five.
I'm gonna go check on Tillinghast.
If she continues to resist, sedate her.
What time do you get off work?
I'm dedicated.
Please, don't do this.
It's not necessary.
I'm all right now.
Please.
He's gone.
Call security.
Crawford, please don't eat those.
They're
delicious.
They... They can make you very sick.
God.
What is happening to me?
We...
We don't know for sure,
but we're going to find out.
We're going to go
in the hall now, Crawford.
Take it easy, honey.
Come quick. Something's happened
and we need your help.
Wait a minute. What about her?
Lock her up in a room.
Katherine?
Katherine!
Wait, God damn it, I need a drink.
Oh, God.
PATIENT: Oh, God, let me out.
- You better hurry before he goes into DTs.
- Yeah, yeah.
Oh, and get me a candy bar. I'm starving.
Harley.
Harley, what's going on?
PATIENT: Oh, no. Oh, dear Lord.
Oh, no. Oh.
I saw a snake.
A snake came out of his head.
It ate him. Dear Lord.
Shit, Harley, you son of a bitch,
he's gone into DTs.
Oh, Lord. Oh, Lord. Oh, Lord.
- Harley?
- Oh, Lord.
Oh, dear Lord.
Oh, God. Oh, no.
- Oh, I saw... I...
- Harley.
You all right?
That's the snake man! That's him!
Somebody! Somebody help me!
Oh, no!
Oh, God, help!
Help!
Someone...
God! Oh!
Oh, help! Somebody help!
Crawford, stop.
Crawford, let me go. What are...
Crawford, please.
Crawford, stop.
No.
Crawford. Oh, my... Don't.
- Why are you doing this?
- Because I love you, Katherine.
Crawford, we have to get out of here.
The Resonator's going to blow up.
- I want us to be together.
- Listen to me.
I set a timing device on a bomb.
We only have a few minutes.
It doesn't matter.
If Pretorious can turn on that machine,
then he'll always have a way back here.
He's always here.
Don't you understand?
He won't just influence us, he'll devour us
and the rest of the human race if he can.
You're so beautiful.
Please, Crawford.
It won't hurt, I promise.
Crawford, help me!
Katherine?
Welcome, my dear.
Oh, I've been waiting for you.
Edward, no!
Yes.
The greatest sensual pleasure there is
is to know the desires of another mind.
I know your desires, you impotent pig.
We are the most powerful being
in the universe.
She'll know, Edward,
how pathetic you are.
How you can't make love.
Maybe you could teach me.
Crawford!
All right. Come and get me, eunuch.
This time I'm not running away.
Katherine, run!
Crawford!
Crawford!
There was a big explosion,
upstairs, at the top of the house.
I've called the fire department.
They'll get you to the hospital.
Oh, my, God.
What happened up there?
It... ate... him.
