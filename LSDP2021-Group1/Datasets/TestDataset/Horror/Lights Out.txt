Hey, kiddo.
Hey, Dad.
Are you coming home soon?
Yeah, in an hour or so.
What's-What's up?
Where's mom?
I don't think she's feeling good.
I know.
Don't worry.
I'm working on
getting her better, okay?
She's...
She's been talking to herself.
Listen.
I will be home with you very soon and
I'm going to get Mom better, I promise.
Okay.
- I'll see you soon, buddy.
- See you soon
Lloyd, Sophie
MEDICAL RECORD
Do you want anyone on overtime?
No, I got to...
I got to...
Just go ahead and close up.
Okay.
The very least, maybe you could get her
to stop locking herself in the closet, okay?
Right?
So we don't call it an intervention,
we call it a...
Paul?
I saw something.
This thing is really starting
to take it's toll on him.
Paul.
One second, please.
What?
There was something in the back room.
What do you mean something?
I don't know.
It disappeared.
Esther, I really got to
deal with this, so...
Just go home, okay?
Be careful on
your way out, okay?
Okay, so I'll be home in about a...
an hour.
Okay.
Yep
Bye.
Esther?
Oh, no, no, no...
Come on!
Whoa!
lights out
Hey.
What's the chance that
we go again?
- Slim to none.
- Mm.
Yeah, that.
- No?
- No.
I'm going to go take a shower.
Hey, maybe I'll join you.
You will smell like girlie soap.
Hey.
- Marathon man.
- I'm up.
Don't think you're staying.
Becca.
- Just one night?
- No.
You're going to kick me out
in the middle of the night?
You're going to be okay.
You're not a puppy.
I thought I was your boyfriend.
Boyfriend?
Who said anything about boyfriend?
Yeah.
Uh, you're a...
a guy, the only guy
that I've been seeing.
It's been eight months.
Really?
Eight months?
Eight months.
Wow.
That officially puts you in the first place.
- How about I keep a pair of jeans here?
- Nope.
A sock?
I mean, just one sock but, of course.
What are you going to do
with one sock?
Is that a yes?
No, get out of here.
I've work tomorrow.
Not like, having a sock here
means you can't get rid of me.
Socks are not anchors.
Okay, I'm going to see you
tomorrow night, at that gig.
Can we just agreed to that, please?
Alright.
Are you still there?
I'll see you tomorrow.
You know, one of these nights,
you're going to let me s...
I love you too.
Hey, sexy.
I like you,
a lot.
Is that all?
No, there is one more thing.
So close.

Mom?
Mom?
I just don't know what to do about it.
I...
I'm so sorry.
I... I really don't know.
Mom?
Hey, Martin.
What's up?
You okay?
Yeah, I will be.
Just... it will take a bit.
Did we wake you?
What?
Hey.
You got to go back
to bed, sweetie.
Hey, the only ones that
should be wondering the halls
at this hour are grown ups.
Good night, Martin.
She isn't answering.
Hey, Martin?
Is there someone else
we can call for you?
It's just...
I didn't know you had a brother.
Yeah.
Are you, Rebecca?
- Yeah.
- I'm Emma, I'm with Child Services.
I was assigned to Martin
after your father died.
Stepfather.
- Excuse me?
- He was my stepfather.
My dad ran off when I was ten
and did not come back.
If we could just...
talk about Martin for a minute.
How is he when he is at home?
Is he sleeping?
I wouldn't know.
I don't live there.
So, it's just your mother
in the house then?
Yeah.
How is she holding up?
Um, well.
She's...
She's taking her antidepressants
if that's what you're asking.
Okay, and...
how bad is it, this depression?
I'm sorry, is Martin okay?
Because...
you're grilling me like
he has a black eye or something.
He fell asleep in
homeroom this morning...
for the third time
in the past week.
Okay, excuse me.
Hey.
You showed up.
Yeah..
I didn't know if you would.
Okay.
Uh, where is Mom?
Martin, I know you and your mother
are going through a lot.
And it's harder for you because
you can't talk to mom about it.
Maybe you even tried to help her?
If you ever want to talk about it,
I'm here, okay?
This is why you left, isn't it?
Uh, no.
My deal was a lot more complicated.
Okay.
Let's go, I'll get you home.
Your house or Mom's?
Where you live.
Hey.
You're going to be okay.
Come on.
He'll be fine.
Okay.
- We'll be in touch.
- Uh-huh.
Here we are.
You should let me stay at your place,
just for a night.
Good luck with that one, buddy.
Um.
You know what?
I do not think you're really
going to like it there.
Because I have these... like weird
kind of scary posters on the wall.
I just need sleep.
We can talk about it.
Yeah.
- Any tips for the Mom's?
- Uh, you are not coming in.
Come on, why not?
Because she's crazy.
Mom goes through phases like this.
Just give her time.
Has she been social with anyone?
Someone keeps on coming over.
Good, who?
Diana.
What did you say?
Her name is Diana.
Hey.
I know what you're going through,
because Mom did the same thing
to me when my dad left.
And I had really
bad dreams about Diana.
That's all that they are, okay?
Because she isn't real.
Becca, hi.
Hi, Mom.
Hey, what are you doing home?
little Mister?
She'll tell you.
He hasn't been sleeping.
Well.
Can you blame him?
Paul was everything to us.
Nearly everything.
Have you been
seeing a therapist, Mom?
I am not going to go to a stranger
to talk about my problems.
I've gone through that before.
You remember?
Yeah, I do remember.
How long have you
been off your meds?
Excuse me?
Yeah.
Do you think I wanted
any of this to happen to me?
What about Martin?
Have you thought of him?
Are you really going to play
the "Bad mother" card with me?
You, of all people, huh?
Do you know what it's like
to raise him without a father?
Look how you turn out.
I'm gonna give you
a few days.
And until you stop
being completely manic,
I'm going to have
Martin staying with me.
- Mm-mm.
- Yeah.
- That's what's going to happen, Mom.
- Mm-mm.
- And you can call me when
you are feeling better.
- No, no, no.
- Pack your bags.
- No, Martin...
I'm ready.
Martin, no, no, no.
Martin, please.
Please. Please.
- You planned this, didn't you.
- Let's go.
- You planned this.
- I didn't plan anything, Mom.
I'll be back as soon as I can.
Remember to take your vitamins.
Rebecca.
- What's going on?
- We're going home.
No, no.
Rebecca, please.
I'm sorry, Mom.
Okay.
Here we are.
You can take the bed.
Or the couch if you want.
No.
This is good.
Okay.
Cool.
My god.
This your idea?
- What do you mean?
- Bring the kid here.
Yeah, he's not safe there.
So, you called the lady
at the school.
That's what CPS is for.
Exactly this.
- He's my brother.
- And she's his mother.
So?
Are you doing this to help him
or to hurt her?
You should leave now.
I know it's a little past dinner time,
so we can call this a midnight snack.
Do you want
crust or no crust?
Um...
Yeah, crust is fine.
Can you make them triangles?
Yeah.
You're just like your big sister.
I used to think love that, already.
Here we go.
Okay.
That's good, it's not even...
Oh.
Sorry, you had a knot.
Rebecca?
Yeah?
If Mom's crazy,
does it mean we're crazy too?
Nope.
Martin?
Hey.
What are you doing down there?
You have to turn the light switch
or...
- Did you take Martin?
- Uh... What?
Who is it?
You can't do this.
She's unstable. It's not...
It's not a safe environment for him.
- Where is he?
- He's in there getting dress for school.
Okay.
- Think about what you want to do.
- Yeah. I did and I brought him here.
I'm not talking about
some knee-jerk reaction.
He can't stay here.
He...
Sure, he can.
Not with...
Rebecca, come on.
You know why I'm here?
She called me.
So Child Services takes orders
from nut jobs now?
I stopped by in person to make sure
she was lucid and she was.
But you know what?
That's-That's not how this works.
Why not?
Sophie's his birth mother,
his legal guardian.
To get Martin from her custody requires
you to file charges against her,
take her to court.
Now that's a long
painful process.
And that's only the first half.
To keep Martin from
being placed in foster care
requires you to prove yourself and
your home as an appropriate surrogate.
That's 2 major choices
for you to make.
Declaring war on your mother and...
transforming yourself into a
responsible guardian for him.
You ready to do that?
I can be a responsible guardian.
It's okay.
I got some sleep.
I'll be better tonight.
Hey.
I got your text, what's up?
- Can you take me to my Mom's?
- Really?
- Really?
- Hey.
- With this whole thing again?
- What?
No, I'll tell you about it in the car.
What are you doing?
- I think we should talk about last night.
- What?
Yeah. How you kicked me out
for being honest with you.
Oh.
Um.
Yeah, I just...
I'm sorry.
You were right.
I was using Martin to get to mom.
Thank you for pointing that out.
- Can we...?
- Mm-mm.
You should apologize to Martin.
Not like that,
but you should still apologize.
Okay, I got to
find out about Diana.
The bitch is real.
Wait.
Who's Diana?
Mom?
Alright, what are we looking for?
We're looking for mom.
If you see her,
we hit the back door, got it?
Got it.
Sophie & Diana
Mulberry Hill, CA
Patient 283,
on October 6th, 1984.
The patient suffers from a unique
skin disorder that manifest itself
with an extreme sensitivity to light.
The patient's stay here
has been very problematic.
She has a history
of violence and...
lately she's obsessed with one of the
patients in the heliotherapy ward.
A young girl named Sophie.
And...
Oh, bring her .
Keep her restraints on.
Thank you.
Hello, Diana.
Keep the lights out.
I hear you've been
very bad again.
Diana, I want you to
stay away from Sophie .
She's my friend.
Then why did you hurt her?
She was getting better.
November the 13th.
The patient's skin
condition is worsening.
We're preparing an experimental treat...
Hold her down!
Use full dose now, 1200 watts.
Turn it off!
Now!
Jesus Chri...
Bret!
Bret!
Stay away.
Stay away, Becca.
I won't be sent away again.
You okay?
What happened?
We got to go, your mom's here.
Get up.
Slow down. Slow down. Slow down.
- Shit.
- Talk to me.
- Oh god.
- What happened up there?
I don't know.
- I was attacked.
- Yeah, by what?
I don't know.
I can't explain it.
What's all this for?
Proof.
That's proof.
I know.
I'm just saying,
you can talk about
your sister to me, okay?
She's fine.
Did you take your vitamins?
Oh.
I am feeling a little better.
But, hey.
Listen, bud, I...
I know I've been a little distant lately
and I really want to fix that.
How about a popcorn and
movie night tonight?
Yes, please.
Good.
I think a little personal time
is just what we need.
The three of us.
- Mom?
- Huh?
How about just you and me tonight?
Okay?
We'll see.
Child, how can you see
with all that light?
Ah. Now that's better.
Now be an angel and run along to Ito
and tell him to bring me
a very light breakfast.
How are you doing down there?
I'm fine.
How are you?
I'm going to be fine.
I am.
I miss your dad.
He made me feel strong.
He made me feel protected and...
I think I need to feel those things
sometimes, you know?
- I think you do too.
- I'm okay.
Rebecca's strong.
Uh, Rebecca acts like she's strong.
And she is sometimes.
But, let me tell you, when things
got tough, she abandoned me.
And I don't want that
to happen to you.
Sometimes the strongest thing to do...
is just to face your fears.
That's what Emma told me.
Yeah.
I think you might be right.
I'll be back.
Mom?
Hey, hey, hey. It's all right.
It's okay, love.
- What are you doing?
- It's okay. It's alright.
Look at me.
Trust me, okay?
- I'm going to tell you a story.
- Mom, please, please.
Shhh, baby.
It was a long time ago.
and I had a friend named Diana.
She was so different, so special.
And...
Look at me.
And later I found out something
really bad happened to her.
But the news, the news
had it wrong, you see.
And she was-she was still there.
And she finally came back.
Mom, please.
Please let go.
No, listen to me.
See... see...
I left her alone for so many years,
I abandoned her.
But now,
she's going to stay, okay?
As long as I keep my head clear
and you keep the lights out.
- NO!
- Martin.
Martin, don't turn on the lights.
Diana doesn't know any better.
No, Diana.
He doesn't understand.
He didn't mean it.
Martin, she didn't mean it.
Please don't do this.
Wait.
So your mother was in a mental
institution when she was younger?
Yeah.
Yeah, it looks that way.
You just never talked about it, that's all.
Neither did she.
I guess it's not really something
that you talk about.
How about I just listen?
Because I'm still don't know
who Diana is.
She's...
It getting worse.
We need to go shopping, babe.
Right.
Can you run to the store?
Okay.
Copy that.
See you in a while.
You want to talk about it now?
I know you don't believe me,
but Diana is real.
- She touched my hair.
- Hey, hey, hey.
Listen to me.
I'm going to tell you something...
that nobody ever told me.
I believe you.
- I don't know what she is.
- She doesn't like the light.
Okay.
Come with me.
Okay.
So.
It turns out that your dad was doing a lot
of research into Mom and Diana's past.
Diana was found in a basement
locked away when she was 13 years old .
And her father had killed himself.
She had a very strange skin disorder.
There were stories about her.
People used to say that
she was evil.
And that she could get inside people's heads,
changed them.
She was taken to
Mulberry Hill Psychiatric Hospital
where she met mom.
And I think she got
inside mom's head...
and made her think that
they were friends.
- But they weren't?
- No.
Diana only comes around
when mom is at her worst.
I went through it too
when I was your age.
When your dad left.
Yeah.
So, what happened to Diana?
The doctors tried an experimental treatment
on her and something went wrong.
And she died.
But...
if she's dead...
How could she be
doing this to us?
I don't know.
But I think that mom is the only
connection Diana has to this world.
You know, I think if
we can get mom better,
get her mind strong again...
Then we can maybe
break that connection.
No.
Diana won't let that happen.
Why do you say that?
Because that's what
my dad was trying to do.
Okay, it's the food.
Hey.
Bret?
Stay there.
REBECCA!
Oh.
Oh god.
Mom, we need to talk.
What?
Can you tell us about Diana?
What are you talking about?
Your friend, Diana.
Martin said that
she was here an hour ago.
Yes.
She's my friend.
Is this your friend, Diana?
Is this her?
Where did you get this?
- Answer my question.
- No, you answer mine.
You met Diana at Mulberry Hill
when you were taken there
for your depression.
- Am I right?
- What does it matter...
- Am I right?
- ... when we met?
What does it matter
when we met?
Because she died.
- She died a year after this photo.
- That is a lie. That is a lie. That is a lie.
I don't know what
you are saying, okay?
- It's the truth. Mom, it's the truth.
- Okay, stop.
Stop.
Okay, I understand.
You are trying to take
him away from me again.
You're trying to take my
son away from me again
so you're making up
these wild stories.
I found her obituary, Mom.
- Explain that.
- You know, those things can be faked.
They can be faked.
You sound crazy.
- Listen to her.
- Me?
I know. I know.
This all sounds a little crazy.
There's a dead woman
in this house.
And you let her in, Mom.
You let her stay.
I know. I see.
I get it.
You came because you feel
bad about leaving me.
Am I right?
I didn't hear from you.
You didn't come see me like most people.
Do you know how
much that hurt me?
And now...
as it turns out
I've shutting Diana out
the same way all this time.
And I'm not going to be the kind
of person that does that to a friend.
A friend?
Mom, we're talking about
a dead person.
Oh, sweetie.
Ghosts aren't real.
Then, what is she?
Then, what is she?
You can sleep over again
at my place tonight.
I'll call CPS in the morning
No.
What do you mean "No"?
I know you've been gone a long time,
but she's our mom.
She needs us now
more than ever.
Hey.
I'm not here for her.
I'm here for you.
You're my priority.
I can't just leave her.
Okay.
But it's not safe here.
It's not safe anywhere.
How long does she usually
stay up in her at night?
Mom?
She doesn't usually come out
again until morning.
Okay.
First priority, we put in
some safeguards.
Bret and I are going to be
on the couch downstairs.
- Okay?
- Okay.
Do you want your door
open or close?
Closed.
Wait.
Can you...
Can you sleep in here tonight?
Sure.
I just have to go tell Bret.
I'll be right back.
You don't have to stay, you know.
I know.
Martin wants me to sleep up
in his room tonight.
Yeah?
He needs you more than
I do right now.
Yeah.
Are you still going to stay?
Unless you say otherwise, yeah.
It will be kind of hard to sleep
with all these lights on.
You must think
we're all crazy.
You know...
I don't think that.
Thank you.
You can be this way around me.
I'm not going anywhere.
Bottom drawer.
- What?
- The bottom drawer.
In the dresser.
I will clean it out for you.
Seriously?
No.
Maybe.
- Okay, goodnight.
- Goodnight.
Mom?
Uh, we're staying overnight.
Okay, I'll see you in the morning.
Love you.
You're staying?
Yes.
Good.
Um.
I was... um.
I would like...
maybe tomorrow morning to start over,
if that's okay with you.
Yeah.
Of course.
Did you ever hear from Dad?
Letters or...
No.
I'm sorry.
I wished I had,
I really wish you had.
I know you blame me,
I don't blame you.
No, I don't.
It was his choice to leave,
not yours.
Okay.
Okay.
Good night.
I need help
Oh, shit!
Rebecca?
Yeah?
Did you find your medicine?
No.
But we'll figure something out.
You think so?
Yeah, bud.
We'll make sure she get's better.
Okay.
Get some sleep.
Shit!
Bret?
Bret?
Shit.
Shit.
Come on.
Rebecca!
Rebecca?
Rebecca?
Rebecca?
Becca.
Nooooo!
Come on.
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?
Don't leave me again.
- Okay.
- Ever!
Hey, alright.
I guess nothing's working.
What else could it be?
A trap.
No...
No!
Hey!
Help!
- Help!
- Bret!
Let us out!
No!
Becks?
Let us out!
Becks!
Bret!
Bret, we're down here!
Alright, Becks,
hold on.
Mrs. Wells?
- Hello?
- NO!
No, Bret!
- Bret!
- Mrs. Wells?
Stay in the light, Bret!
Bret!
Okay, Becks, hold on.
Okay.
Oh!
Bret...
Bret?
Bret, come here!
Is he leaving?
No.
No, no.
He wouldn't do that.
You did.
Oh.
No!
Oh, come on!
That won't seem last long.
We need to find more light.
Rebecca?
Hello?
Martin?
Diana, where are you?
I told you not to
hurt my children.
They don't know any better.
Do not threaten me, Diana.
No.
You need me, Diana!
There's no you without me.
Alright.
There's something that I should never...
How long are we
going to be in here?
I don't know.
There's no windows.
Yeah.
I'm working on a plan.
I'm not much help to you.
Hey.
You're doing great.
Okay?
Keep looking through that box.
I found a flashlight,
or something.
It's a black light.
It's still got some juice.
Wait.
Where are you going?
To take an inventory.
Keep feeding the fire.
Oh, God!
Oh my god.
JUST LIKE THE HOSPITAL
TRAPPED DOWN HERE IN THE DARK.
Holy shit!
TRYING TO TAKE SOPHIE AWAY FROM ME
JUST LIKE FATHER
Forget Diana.
Let's go!
I saw her.
She doesn't disappear in is light.
So?
So if we can see, at least
we know where he is.
And maybe we can
even hurt her with this.
What now?
- Mom!
- Mom!
- Mom!
- Mom!
Are we going to die?
No.
We're fighters. You hear me?
We're fighters.
She's in there!
My girlfriend and her family.
Sir, get back in your vehicle.
You need to get to a hospital.
- You need flashlights.
- Get back in your car. Okay?
Unit 81, we're at the Marigold house.
The power I'm afraid is out, over.
LAPD.
Anyone home?
Hello?
LAPD, we're responding
to a domestic disturbance.
We're here!
We're down here!
Help!
Diana?
If you hurt my kids,
we're never speaking again!
Yeah.
Yeah.
Keep the light us.
Ma'am?
Show yourself.
Back off!
Oh, God!
Andrews?
Oh, my God.
Oh, God!
Unit 99,  get me backup.
Officer down.
Here, take this.
You won't see her either wise.
- Take it!
- Stay back.
Take it!
- We have to go!
- No. No, we have to get mom!
- No, we got to go!
- I'm not leaving without mom!
- Okay! I'll get it, I promise! Come on!
- No! Becca!
- What?
- How?
What?
What?
Becks!
Go!
Go!
Alright.
Come here, buddy.
Oh god.
Get him out of here.
- No!
- It's okay. Come here.
- Let go of me!
- I got you. I got you.
Rebecca!
I'm going to get Mom!
Okay.
Mom?
Mom?
Stay away...
or I'll show you
where I put your father.
I told you!
Don't hurt my kids.
Mom, she killed dad.
That won't hurt me.
This will.
There's no you without me.
No!
Mom, what are you doing?
Saving your lives.
NO!
No!
Mom!
I'm here, bud.
I got you.
Here you go.
You came back.
Of course.
So did you.
Yeah
No more running away.
We're here to stay.
Hey, it's okay.
It's nothing.
I got you guys, alright?
Yeah.
We're never going away.
Come here.
