Hey, Layla.
Have you been a good girl?
You're just hungry.
Come on, girl.
Yeah, me too.
Come on, Audrey,
you can do this.
MAN: The patients are
beginning to speak
Something I don't dare admit
I've felt before.
While I continue to explain
away the Boogeyman's existence
as nothing but the darkness
within ourselves,
does that make him
anything less than real?
Layla, no.
It's time for bed.
Layla?
Layla, are--? Are you okay?
What's wrong, girl?
Did you hurt yourself?
And we're back.
You're listening to Headspace
on WZXB,
Wolfbridge University radio.
I'm Sarah Morris and as always,
I'm here with Dr. Roger Kane,
clinical psychiatrist
and head of Wolfbridge's
Psychology Department.
And we've got Liam on the line.
Liam, how can we help you?
LIAM: Yeah, this is a
question for Sarah.
Fire away, Liam.
I listen to your show
every night.
What exactly
is your question?
So, what do you say, Sarah?
Can I take you out sometime?
Heh! Sorry, Liam, my boyfriend
is understanding,
but not that understanding.
So I guess a blowjob's
completely out of the question?
Uh, not necessarily.
Just bend down as far
as you can, open up wide
and give it your best shot.
Uh, our next call is from Eric.
Eric, how are you tonight?
ERIC:
Okay, I guess.
My girlfriend broke up
with me last week,
and I've been having
a hard time dealing with it.
SARAH: Well, sounds like you
really cared about her.
and I haven't made
that many friends.
I guess I just need
someone to talk to.
Well, that's why we're here,
Eric. Fire away.
Hey, you still here?
Hi. Just putting
the finishing touches
on my ultimate breakup CD.
You know,
one of the cry-in-your-beer
women-are-nothing-but-crazy
manipulative-bitches variety.
For that last caller?
I had Brandon get his info
before he hung up.
Sarah...
I know. I just--
He seemed so sad.
You know, he was blaming himself
for everything
he's going through,
and I knew what that feels like.
I'm proud of you.
What you've overcome
this past year...
It's gonna make you
a great psychiatrist one day.
I don't need to explain
why a psychiatrist should never
hand-deliver a sappy mix CD
to a broken-hearted
patient's bedroom, do I?
It's a good thing
I'm not a psychiatrist yet.
I'm serious. Never underestimate
the influence
your words
and actions have on others.
Okay.
See you.
Bye.
BOY:
Thank you very much.
This is more than a spoonful.
This is like a Mama Jug, huh,
right?
Well, hello sweet cheeks.
Don't touch my tits.
That's the property
of Alpha Sigma Theta.
Did you see that guy?
I'm telling you, guys,
I fucking aced
my poetry final this morning.
Poetry? Seriously?
Yeah, man.
My professor says I'm the next
rock poet in the making.
Aw, my very own
Jim Morrison.
Who?
What do you got there, Lukas?
It looks like-- I don't know.
Grilled shit on a bun?
GIRL: Ugh.
Mmm.
People actually get paid
to make this shit.
Should have went
to culinary school.
You're killing
in bong hits and games.
You might as well stick to that.
Hey, did you talk to your dad
about winter break yet?
Uh, yeah. Yeah, I told him
I was going home with you,
and he's fine with it.
That is so awesome. My family's
gonna love you so much.
Um, so has anyone
heard from Audrey?
Um, I left a message
on her cell,
I just haven't heard back yet.
Wow, the murders are all over
the news. It's--
I didn't realize her dad
was a big deal.
Oh, he's huge.
He's been published
in every major Psych journal.
Maybe-- Maybe I should try
her cell again.
Maybe you should give her
some time.
She may not wanna
talk about it yet.
Yeah, I know.
I'm just worried about her.
Ha-ha-ha! Jeremy, Jeremy,
little bit of vitamin C?
That's my tiggity.
I look so stupid
without the one.
All right, well, ta-ta.
Later, Ben.
Did you see him?
Ugh!
I'm never taking a shower
again.
You showered in your bikini?
Yeah.
Some perv fraternity is making
their pledges install webcams
in the girls' showers.
Yeah.
Oh, come on.
I hear that story twice a semester.
No.
A girl in my theater class
told me that it happened to--
It happened to, like, one
of her friends in another dorm.
Hearsay. There's no way
that that's true.
Well, I'm not taking
any chances.
I'm not ending up
on the Internet like last time.
Um, your dad
left another message.
Uh, yeah, I got it.
He thinks you're coming home
for the holidays.
I'll call him.
Just as soon as this term paper
is out of the way.
How's it coming?
Oh, so incredibly slow.
Yeah?
At this rate,
I'll be up all night.
Oh, okay.
Well, in that case,
um, yoink,
I am going
to Jeremy's room.
I will see you in the morning.
Oh, have some sex for me.
Oh, you know I will. Oh, yeah.
That's so unfair. Bye.
Lindsay?
Audrey?
What's going on?
Oh, my God, are you okay?
Hey.
He's trying to kill me.
Who's trying to kill you?
The Boogeyman.
He killed my dad
and now he's trying
to kill me too.
I'm-- I'm sorry, Sarah.
I didn't know where else to go.
Audrey, the Boogeyman
didn't kill your dad.
He did.
I've seen him.
He's everywhere.
I thought I got away,
but he keeps following me.
Sarah,
I don't wanna die.
You're not gonna die.
Come here.
Hey...
I'm gonna help you through this,
I promise.
You're gonna sleep here tonight,
okay?
It doesn't matter where I sleep.
He'll still find me.
Where are you going?
I'm just going to get
some water, okay?
It'll just take a minute.
Just try and go back to sleep.
I'll be right back.
Sarah?
Sarah?
Are you in here?
Help! Somebody open the door!
Open this door!
Audrey, what's wrong?
We-- We-- We have to go. Now.
He's in here.
Hey, hey, hey, it's okay.
There's nobody in here. Look.
Look, everything
is gonna be okay.
Stop saying that, Sarah.
Everything is not gonna be okay.
Wait. Audrey.
Audrey, wait. Audrey.
He tried to get me.
Audrey...
Oh.
Audrey, what happened?
Nothing.
Just go away.
Oh, please open the door
and talk to me.
Audrey?
Ben. Hey, is David here?
DAVID:
Hey, morning.
So you finally cut his tongue out?
Yeah.
Hell week. He can't talk to
anyone but his pledge brothers.
Oh, so the Greek system truly
does provide community service.
Oh. Heh-heh!
Bye.
You look stressed.
Audrey's back.
She thinks the Boogeyman
killed her dad.
What?
She's convinced
he wants to kill her.
Will you check in on her
and make sure she's okay?
I've got finals
and the radio show.
Oh, yeah, no, of course.
Thanks. I left a note
for Lindsay. Gotta go, I'm late.
Well, hey,
are you okay?
Fine.
I promise.
And we're ready
for our next caller.
Hi, you're on with Sarah
and Dr. Kane.
Caller,
do you have a question?
AUDREY:
Hi. Ahem.
I'm being stalked.
SARAH: It's Audrey.
He won't leave me alone.
I-- I don't know
what else to do.
He just follows me
everywhere I go.
KANE:
Is he a friend, a boyfriend?
I'm afraid we need to know
about your situation fully
in order to help you.
You wouldn't believe me
if I told you.
Why wouldn't we believe you?
Because you don't believe
in the Boogeyman.
What exactly do you mean
by the Boogeyman?
I'm next.
Your father was one of those
killed at the Hillridge Clinic.
I'm very sorry.
You must be experiencing
a great deal of pain.
Look, I-- I know
you don't believe me,
but you will.
Once I'm dead,
you'll know I was right.
Call campus security and get
someone over to Hammonds Hall.
Which room?
KANE:
Tell them she may be suicidal.
Sarah?
Sarah?
Hello?
Let's begin
by clarifying a few things.
I understand your father
was killed
by a man who thought
he was the Boogeyman.
No. No. Look, it was him.
I've tried to tell Sarah
but she won't listen.
I wouldn't believe me either
but it's the truth.
He's real.
I don't know what to do.
You do realize the Boogeyman
is a legend?
One that a very sick man used as
an excuse to hurt your father,
I-- I found my dad's journal.
Look, he knew
the Boogeyman was real.
He knew he was gonna die.
Look, my dad was trying to help
those people before they all--
Hello, caller? Are you there?
Caller, are you there?
Hello?
Yeah. I'm...
I'm still here.
Hello, caller? Are you there?
Hello?
What's going on?
Someone's attacking Audrey.
What?
He's strangling her.
Jesus Christ.
Look, stay here. Stay here.
I'll call the police.
You sure you're gonna be
okay?
All right, if we need
anything else, we'll call you.
Did you tell them what you saw?
Sarah, are you all right?
What happened?
I heard someone say
that Audrey--
That she--
It's not true, is it?
She hung herself with a belt.
Jeez.
SARAH:
I think I'm getting sick again.
You feel fine to me.
No, I mean sick.
Sick the way I was last year.
I saw something
in Audrey's room.
Something that
wasn't really there.
What did you see?
Sarah, if you don't wanna
talk about it--
I saw someone
standing over Audrey
like they had strangled her.
Who was it?
I don't know.
Sarah, you were in shock.
You witnessed one of your
best friends die tonight.
It's probably--
It's the same way my mom died.
What if it triggered something?
Something that I thought
wasn't there anymore?
No.
Sarah, listen to me.
After what you've
been through tonight,
you could tell me you saw
a herd of pink elephants
in Audrey's room
and I'd still think
you're the sanest girl I know.
Hello?
Hey.
Katie,
hey.
Sorry,
I'm a little jumpy this morning.
I think we all are.
They asked me
to pack up Audrey's things.
Already?
Yeah, dorms close in 48 hours.
KATIE:
You two were pretty close, huh?
Yeah, we were.
KATIE: Hey, where should
I send her stuff?
The only contact listed
was her dad.
He was all she had left.
Well, if there's anything of
hers that you'd like to keep...
Yeah, I think there is.
Thanks, Katie.
Uh, he ain't here.
Where is he?
Study group.
Uh, Sarah, by the way, um, I'm
really sorry about your friend.
Yeah, a bunch of us were
listening to your radio show
when she called in.
It was freaky shit.
If there's anything
I can do...
Thanks. Will you tell David
I stopped by?
Yeah, sure.
I just can't stop
thinking about it, man.
She said someone strangled her.
Yeah, well,
she was confused.
LUKAS: I'm just saying
it's fucking freaky.
So, um, am I helping you
pack your clothes
or am I simply packing them?
Ahem, yeah, come in.
Come in.
SARAH:
Careful. I got high
just walking down the hallway.
Everything okay?
Uh, I found something
in Audrey's room.
Her dad's
private journal.
Audrey was right about her dad.
He did believe
the Boogeyman was real.
You know, he thought he was some
kind of physical manifestation
of our darkest fears.
Well, you said he was
a respected psychologist.
He never told anyone
what he wrote in the journal.
He was afraid his patients
would suffer for it.
More like his career.
His theory was that
his patients
were susceptible
to the Boogeyman
because they believed in him.
When you said
Audrey was strangled,
who did you think--?
I mean, you didn't--
Let's change
the subject, okay?
I just can't believe
her nutjob dad
was in charge
of helping those patients.
It's strange. Even though
his theories are illogical,
he doesn't come off like
a raving lunatic in the journal.
He articulates his thoughts
clearly.
JEREMY :
Come on, Sarah.
I mean, if you believe a word
of what was in that journal,
you're as crazy as he was.
What?
That's not what I said.
Shit, sorry.
I just meant that--
Don't worry about it.
It's cool.
You're almost all done packing.
I've just been procrastinating.
I should probably get started.
Right this second?
Just stick around.
That's okay.
I'll see you guys later.
Hello? Earth
to Captain Oblivious?
It came out
the wrong way.
Yeah.
ANSWERING MACHINE:
You have one new message.
DAD:
Sarah, it's your dad.
You're probably busy
with finals,
but, uh, I was wondering when
you were planning
I haven't seen you
since the funeral and...
MACHINE:
To delete this message,
Damn it.
LINDSAY:
Hey, what happened?
Uh, I just, um, had a fight
with the window shade.
You kick its ass?
No, the other way around.
That's all right.
Thanks.
Yeah.
SARAH:
I thought you guys were packing.
Yeah, I was packing.
Now we're taking a break
and, um, you are coming
to grab a bite with us.
Actually, I'm not feeling
so well
so I think I'm just
gonna go to bed.
JEREMY :
Bed?
There's no bed in finals week.
Um, I didn't get much sleep
last night.
LINDSAY:
Yeah, who did?
Hey, come on.
You know, it might do us some
good to just get out of here.
You guys go ahead.
Seriously.
Come on.
Okay.
See you later?
Mm-hm.
Okay, have fun.
Boo!
Mm-hm.
Lighter, check.
Bong, check.
Ignite.
I'll be there
Oh, shit--
Sh--
Oh...
Shit.
Shit!
Oh, shit.
I gotta stop smoking.
Ah!
I gotta stop smoking.
I gotta stop smoking.
I gotta go to rehab.
I gotta do something.
I gotta stop.
Huh?
Hello?
Lukas?
Lukas.
What the hell is going on?
Lukas, answer me.
What happened to you?
Sarah, hey.
Whoa, whoa, what happened?
We have to find Lukas.
I think he's hurt.
Lukas? How did he get hurt?
I don't--
I saw him in the kitchen.
He was, uh, bleeding.
He had glass in his mouth.
Glass? Sarah, are you sure
there was glass in his mouth?
Yes, but everything
was different.
Different?
How were things different?
Hey, what are you guys
doing?
Have you seen Lukas?
Lukas? No, we've been
at dinner.
Why? What's wrong?
Please, can you just
help me find him?
Can we look in your room?
Sure. Come on.
He's not here.
He's probably just out
studying somewhere.
Yeah, or getting
smashed.
Um, why are you so worried
about Lukas?
I saw him in the kitchen
with blood and glass
pouring out of his mouth.
Well, are you sure
it was Lukas?
Yes, I'm positive.
Well, I'll call
his mobile.
Did he say anything?
Tell you what happened?
No, he-- He tried to talk
but he couldn't.
And then somebody grabbed me--
Wait. Who grabbed you?
Lukas,
it's Jeremy.
Look, man, give me a ring
when you get this, yeah?
Voice mail.
Sarah, who grabbed you?
It was the same person I saw
in Audrey's room last night.
JEREMY:
You mean...
the Boogeyman?
I know how it sounds.
I do. But--
Sarah.
It sounds like--
Like you had
a horrible fucking nightmare.
I've had dreams like that
before.
I mean, they're so real,
they're freaky.
This was different.
Sarah, you're--
You're probably just exhausted
and, uh, everything will seem
clearer to you in the morning.
Um,
yeah, I don't know. Maybe.
Sarah, wait.
Hey.
Hey.
Yeah, I'm gonna-- I'm gonna
stay with her tonight.
Yeah, good idea.
Um, will you let me know
if you hear from Lukas?
Yeah.
Okay.
Bye.
SARAH: I can only come up
with one logical explanation.
It's happening again.
What do you mean?
Me seeing things
that aren't there.
You know,
maybe it wouldn't be
such a bad thing
if you went home
for the holidays.
This has nothing to do
with where I spend the holidays.
Okay, look.
Yeah, it's-- It's been
a fucking rough 24 hours,
but that's all this means.
Two days from now,
you're gonna be away
from everything
that's happened here.
Relaxing.
I know.
Don't worry about this.
You're fine.
I know you are.
Fuck.
VOICE :
Jeremy.
Hello?
Is someone there?
Lukas? Is that you?
Hey, where are you going, man?
Lukas?
Lukas?
What the fuck?
Lukas, mate.
Shit.
What the fuck?
What the--?
What?
What the fuck?
Oh, my God.
Help!
Oh, help!
That's the worst sound
in the world.
Lindsay,
where's your cell phone?
Hey, Jeremy never called.
Do you think that means
he didn't hear from Lukas?
Mm.
Or it was late when he did.
Jeremy? Lukas?
JEREMY : Hey, it's me.
Leave a word, mate.
Well, everyone deals with stress
in different ways.
Uh, some people completely lose
interest in sex, while others--
WOMAN:
Not my boyfriend.
He says sex is the only way
he can relieve stress.
If it's affecting
your studies,
then you need to tell him
there are other ways--
Sarah, what do you think
I should do?
Just be open and honest
with your boyfriend.
And if he disregards
your concerns,
then there's a much larger
problem with your relationship.
Okay, well,
thanks for the advice.
Well, that's what we're
here for, right, Sarah?
That's right.
Finals week is stressful so we're doing
extra shows this week to help you out.
Great. Thank you for listening.
We'll be right back.
Sorry.
It's okay. It's all right.
Wanna take a breather?
Yeah.
Let's take a break.
Yeah.
LINDSAY:
They're around somewhere.
Yeah, I know,
um, but, Linds,
will you just check in
on them?
Make sure they're okay. I'm just
getting a little worried.
Thanks.
Um, I gotta go.
I'll call you back.
I'm sorry.
I know I've been distracted.
A couple of my friends
are missing and I've--
I've been seeing things again.
What kind of things?
The night Audrey died was the
first time I saw the Boogeyman.
Sarah--
I know what you're gonna say.
This is not about the Boogeyman.
This is about--
Audrey dying the same way
my mom died, I know.
This is about your guilt.
It's always been
about the guilt.
You blame yourself
for not preventing
your mother's suicide.
You think I blame myself
for Audrey too?
I think a lot
of those guilty feelings
came bubbling back
up to the surface.
What do you think?
I wish I'd taken Audrey
more seriously.
By believing
in the Boogeyman?
Validating her fear
by making it your own?
Sarah, you're not afraid
of the Boogeyman.
You're afraid of the guilt.
Of what it's capable of.
Guilt that you've never
completely come to terms with.
So I'm going crazy because
I'm afraid of going crazy?
That's what you're saying?
You're not crazy.
Either I'm crazy
or the Boogeyman is real.
And right now,
I don't know which one is worse.
They're the same fear.
Sarah, once you face it,
you'll find that neither
of those things
will bother you anymore.
This is ridiculous.
Oh, my God.
I don't believe in you.
You don't exist.
I don't believe in you.
You don't exist.
I don't believe in you.
You don't exist.
I don't believe in you.
You don't fucking exist.
Great.
You really are going crazy.
Oh, my God.
Jeremy?
Help me. Help me, please.
Help me.
Tell me what to do.
Get me out.
I'm gonna go
and I'm gonna find some help.
Then I'm gonna get you out,
you hear me?
No, don't leave me.
No.
Sarah. Sarah.
Are you okay?
Hey. Come here.
Come here.
Come here, Sarah.
Are you okay? Come here.
Oh, my God, what happened?
How did--? How did I get--?
You were under your bed.
I heard you screaming.
Oh, Jesus, Sarah,
you're bleeding.
That's not my blood.
What? Whose blood is it?
That's Jeremy's blood.
Jeremy? How did--?
That's where he grabbed me.
That means he's real.
David...
that means
the Boogeyman is real.
No, no, come here.
Come here.
What's up, man?
Hey.
See, Sarah?
There's no blood.
It didn't actually happen.
No dead bodies.
But I saw them.
I-- I recognized
their faces.
They're the people
who live in this dorm.
GIRL 1:
Yeah, it was the Boogeyman.
I heard it on the radio.
That's why she killed herself.
GIRL 2:
Do you know what else is weird?
I heard that Jeremy and Lukas
are missing.
Did you hear
what they said?
Yeah.
Listen, everyone on campus
listens to your radio show.
People are bound to start
talking. It doesn't mean a--
Are you okay?
It looked like someone
was up there watching me.
I don't see anything.
There was something up there.
Don't you see what's happening?
They're all starting to believe.
You don't know--
Which is what happened
to the patients
at the Hillridge Clinic.
They started to believe--
What happened at Hillridge
won't happen here because
everyone is leaving tomorrow.
The dorms close tomorrow
at noon, right?
Oh, my God.
The suitcases all over
the hallway. It's gon--
It's gonna happen tomorrow
when everyone's leaving.
Sarah.
I think...
maybe you should just spend
winter break with your dad.
Are you serious?
Yeah.
He called earlier and he said he
hadn't talked to you in months.
Why'd you lie to me?
I'm sorry. I was gonna tell him.
I just--
You really don't want me
to come home with you?
I just don't want you
to use me as an excuse.
I mean, you haven't been home
since your mom died.
Maybe it'd be good for you.
Good for me?
What does that mean?
It's disgusting.
Ben, what's up?
All right, let's go.
I'm just saying it's okay if
you're not completely over it,
just as long as you're still
trying to deal with it.
Is that a blueprint
of the women's restroom?
It's true?
You're gonna put a webcam
in the women's restroom
for your fraternity?
Dude, that is so sketchy.
Yeah, well, if I don't,
I stay a pledge next semester.
Have you any idea
what I've been through? Hm?
The humiliation?
There ain't no way I'm going
through that shit again.
Some other guy was supposed to
do it, but he never came back.
Probably got caught.
Fucking idiot.
I will give you 50 bucks
to do it for me.
I hope you're kidding.
No. You can walk
right into the bathroom.
I have to crawl through
the fucking heating ducts.
I don't think
that's a good idea.
Me either. That's why
you should do it for me.
No, Ben, I'm serious. I saw--
What?
I saw blood
coming out of those vents.
Blood.
Oh, man.
Is this about the--?
The Boogeyman?
Because that's what everyone in
the cafeteria was talking about.
See? That's what
I'm talking about.
Everyone's talking about it
because--
Because it's fucking creepy.
No, it's completely
irrational.
I'm just trying
to help you, Sarah.
I appreciate your help.
DAVID:
Where are you going?
Haven't you heard?
I'm going crazy.
I feel really shitty.
DR. ALLEN:
The patients are beginning
to speak of a presence
in the clinic.
Something they can feel.
Something I can feel.
Something I don't dare admit
I've felt before.
While I continue
to explain away
as nothing but the darkness
within ourselves,
Does that make him
anything less than real?
Come on, man,
let's find those girls.
You missed
your Behavioral Genetics final.
Dr. Kane, I'm sorry.
I-- I had something important
I had to take care of.
More important
than passing my class?
"Sociology of Modern
Oral Legends."
Thinking about
changing your major?
I found this article
in Dr. Allen's journal.
He was trying to find a way
to stop the Boogeyman.
Sarah, we've talked about this.
The Boogeyman is not real.
He is a legend.
A-and according to this article,
a legend lives or dies
based on its social relevancy.
A legend is a fictional story,
Sarah.
Not a living, breathing entity.
You do realize that?
Sarah, indulge me.
Why do we create legends,
just from a psychological
point of view?
We create legends
as parables.
Stories to help us understand
the world we live in.
Whew.
All right.
Okay.
This is the most fun
I've had in years.
So, what does that say
about the Boogeyman?
It says we're trying
to define evil
by giving it a face
and a name.
Yes. And as long as there
is evil in this world,
the Boogeyman remains
socially relevant.
That's all it's saying.
No, it's saying
that the legend survives
because the person
retelling the story believes it.
But you're taking that
completely out of context.
Don't you see?
The Hillridge Clinic murders,
they make the legend real.
It's as if the legend
has a life of its own.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, hello, baby.
Oh, what you want?
Yeah, that's right.
Let me introduce you
to my one-eyed friend.
GIRL 1:
Did you hear anything?
Up there.
You guys, this is creepy.
GIRL 2:
What was that? What was that?
SARAH: There was an
incident last year.
A man named Tim Jensen
blamed his murders
on the Boogeyman.
And what does that have to do
with this?
Both stories are different
variations
of the same legend.
Usually, when a person
retells the legend,
they change it
to fit society's needs.
But in this case--
Wait, wait, wait. Sarah,
listen to what you're saying.
A-- A-- A legend cannot
modify itself.
This one can.
To some people,
the Boogeyman is Tim Jensen.
To other people,
it's Henry Porter.
But it's the original legend
that gains its strength
every time it's reborn.
So you missed my final
because you were trying
to stop a legend
from perpetuating itself.
You understand
why that worries me?
I'm running out of time.
Wait a minute, Sarah.
Sarah?
What the...?
Blood.
Oh, fuck.
So, what are you saying, Sarah?
Every time someone
buys this crap,
the Boogeyman gets stronger?
It keeps the legend alive.
It keeps him alive.
David, it's about to happen
here. In this dorm.
The legend is about
to be reborn.
What did I miss?
Did you talk
to Jeremy or Lukas?
No. And I've
looked everywhere.
See? It's happening.
Well, Jeremy did have
finals all day.
They probably went out
to celebrate after.
Without calling you?
I'm not saying
he won't be punished.
I just-- I don't think
he was killed
by some
mythological creature.
SARAH:
Come on, Lindsay.
What was the longest Jeremy's
ever gone without calling you?
An hour?
Sarah,
you're my best friend
and I love you,
but if you honestly think
that everyone in our dorm
is gonna die,
why aren't you leaving?
Because I can't do that.
I can't just walk away
and let everyone--
I have to get them
out of here.
Sarah, this is ridiculous.
You're not going to convince
an entire dorm full of people
to just leave.
JEFF :
This is DJ Def Jeff,
and you're listening
to WZXB radio.
I'll be with you
all night long
keeping the energy alive
so all those can stay awake.
JEFF:
Listen to this.
What the hell--?
Hi. You're not even supposed
to be here tonight.
What are you doing?
Attention.
All students living
in Hammonds Hall,
: this is Sarah Morris
with an emergency announcement.
Oh, shit.
Campus security has issued
an emergency request
for all students to evacuate
:
Hammonds Hall immediately.
Take your belongings
and stay with a friend.
I repeat. This is
an emergency announcement
for students of Hammonds Hall
to evacuate immediately.
Take your belongings with you.
Several students
are already missing.
It's dangerous
for anyone to remain--
MAN :
You're listening to WZXB Radio.
Up next, DJ Def Jeff
and the smooth grooves.
What the hell are you doing?
I'm calling campus security.
They haven't made
any announcement.
Sarah Morris?
Are you Sarah Morris?
Yes, but listen to me.
I can explain.
I'm sure.
Please. There is a journal
in my room, that will-- David.
Hey, back off.
Tell me where you're taking her.
Go back to your dorm,
she'll call you when she's done.
Don't go back to the dorm.
Promise.
Get in the car.
Back off.
Please, David.
David, don't go back.
David.
Hey, David.
Um, is Sarah with you?
DAVID: No, they took her
to the security office.
Security office? Why?
Long story.
Is she okay?
Yeah, but they
won't let me see her.
No, I still haven't heard
from Jeremy or Lukas.
I'm, um...
I'm--
I'm starting to wonder if--
What?
Maybe Sarah was right.
Yeah, I'm packing up my stuff
and getting out of here.
Okay. Well,
just keep me posted.
Bye.
Bye.
Help!
Somebody help me!
Help!
Help!
Help! Help!
Help! Help!
KANE: Oh, come on.
Is this totally necessary?
I mean,
it's a little bit extreme
keeping her locked
in a cell on her own.
She's claiming everyone
in her dorm is going to die.
SARAH:
Dr. Kane.
All right.
What are you doing here?
Sarah.
You have half the student body
in a total panic for nothing.
My friends Jeremy
and Lukas are dead.
I saw them. There was
blood all over the hallway.
And then--
Sarah.
You're relapsing to the time
of your mother's death.
You have to let go.
Sarah,
it is not your fault.
I know
it's not my fault.
This has nothing to do
with how my mother died.
Please.
I just-- I know something
horrible is gonna happen.
Why hasn't anyone else
seen this blood?
Because it is in your head.
Campus security.
GIRL:
I just found some girl's body!
She's inside the--
God, there's blood everywhere!
H-Hey, calm down.
Where are you
calling from?
I'm in the-- In the
laundry room in Hammonds Hall.
Okay, stay where you are.
I'm gonna
call the police
and I'm on my way
over there right now.
A student's body's been found
in Hammonds Hall.
I gotta go. Come on.
No, it's okay.
I'll take care of her.
All right.
See? I was telling you
the truth.
It's him.
That's not what this means.
You can't honestly believe
that this was a coincidence.
Please.
If we don't do something
they're gonna find more
bodies in that dorm. Just--
You have to believe me.
Oh, my God.
You do believe me.
That is not
what you think it is.
No.
Wait, Dr. Kane.
Don't go in there.
See?
Absolutely nothing
to worry about.
Dr. Kane!
Sarah, get the keys.
Get the keys.
There.
On the desk, Sarah.
Oh, my God.
SARAH:
Okay.
Oh, God.
I don't know which one it is.
Try them one at a time.
Hurry.
Oh, my God.
For God's sake,
Sarah, hurry.
Oh, my God.
Kane!
No.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean for you...
He used me.
DAVID :
Sarah.
David.
Sarah, slow down.
Where are you?
He wanted me to see
Audrey die.
He wanted me to tell people
about it. He used me.
He used me to convince everyone
he was real.
Sarah, you were right.
You were right about everything.
I'm so sorry
I didn't believe you.
Tell me where to take
the journal
and I'll be right there.
Wait, where are you?
DAVID:
I'm in your room.
You're still in the dorm.
David, you have to get out
of there.
David.
David, you have to get out
of the dorm now.
OFFICER 1:
Go around back.
OFFICER 2:
You heard him. Go around back.
I'm not kidding, there was
someone hiding under my bed.
I swear to God there was.
Oh, David.
David, what's wrong?
David, please talk to me.
David, come on, let's go.
Let's just get out of here.
You were right.
The Boogeyman is real.
No!
Sarah, help me.
No!
You son of a bitch!
Please. Don't let go.
Don't let go.
DAVID: No.
No.
No!
No!
David.
Let him go.
DAVID :
No!
SARAH:
Oh, my God.
Sarah, what's going on?
What the hell happened here?
Sarah, tell them.
Tell them about
the Boogeyman.
He's real,
isn't he?
Oh, my.
I-it was me.
I killed him.
KATIE: No.
I killed all of them.
There's no such thing
as the Boogeyman.
It was me.
Start evacuating the building.
Come on. All right,
everybody out of here.
Come on. Let's go. Come on.
OFFICER: Put your hands
behind your back.
MAN:
Cut the string.
Let's go.
OFFICER:
So how'd you do it?
How'd you get your boyfriend
into all those pieces?
You don't expect us to believe
you actually ripped him apart,
do you?
It was me. I did it.
Okay.
We have to get out of here.
This is Officer Young.
The elevator
seems to be stuck
between the first
and second floors.
Requesting
immediate assistance.
WOMAN  Say again,
Officer Young. You're breaking up.
We have to get out of here
right now.
Just calm down.
They'll get us in a second.
This is Officer Young requesting
assistance.
The elevator is stuck between
the first and second floors.
We need--
This is DJ Def Jeff,
the voice of Woodbridge
University's radio WZXB.
I hope all of you
freshman listeners
managed to survive
the first week of classes.
Here we go.
Campus radio sucks.
Jennifer, did you hear me?
I'm trying to study.
Nobody studies
the first week of classes.
You're crazy.
So was the last girl
who lived here.
What are you talking about?
That girl.
The one who thought
the Boogeyman
was killing everyone.
The RA told me
this was her room.
You're so full of shit.
I'm serious.
It all happened
in our building.
Seriously?
They just changed the name
so no one would be scared
to live here.
After all, who wants
to live in a building
where they found bodies
in the heating vents?
What's wrong,
are you scared?
I'm annoyed.
I'm going to the library.
Where it's quiet.
Come on,
I was just kidding around.
I'll be quiet.
I will see you
in the morning.
Seriously, I'll be quiet.
You don't wanna be in here
alone, do you?
Don't be ridiculous.
Hey, Amy.
Don't let the Boogeyman
get you.
Whatever.
Changed your mind, huh?
Too scared to walk
to the library alone?
Oh, ha-ha.
Jennifer,
you're hilarious.
Wait.
It's not Jennifer.
Who could it be?
No.
Is it the Boogeyman?
All right, I admit it.
I was scared, okay?
