Child's Play 4  Bride Of Chucky BRRip_tinymoviez.com
- Hello.
- Hey, I'm on my way.
- And don't forget my money.
- See you soon.
- And, Bailey, don't you forget.
Shit.
- Shit!
- Jesus!
Cool.
Well, hello, dolly.
What are you
thinking about
Who do you
think you are
Oh, rage in the cage
and piss upon the stage
There's only one sure way
to bring the giant down
Defunct the strings
of cemetery things
We're one flat foot
on the devil's wings
Crawl on me
sink into me
Die for me
living dead girl
Crawl on me
sink into me
Die for me
living dead girl
What are you
thinking about
What are you
thinking about
Who do you
think you are
Oh, raping the geek
and hustling the freak
Like a hunchback juice
on a sentimental noose
Operation filth, they love
to love the wealth
Of an S.S. whore
making scary sounds
Crawl on me
sink into me
Die for me
living dead girl
Crawl on me
sink into me
Die for me
living dead girl
Ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo
What are you
thinking about
Aw, crawl on me
sink into me
Die for me
living dead girl
Blood on her skin
Dripping with sin
Do it again
Living dead girl
Hello. I'm Chief Kincaid,
Jade's uncle.
- David Collins. Nice to meet you, sir.
- David, come on in.
Jade!
David's here!
I've been hearing good things about you, David.
You're off to Princeton next fall.
Yes, sir.
- What are you going to study?
- Theater Arts.
Mm-hmm. But on an athletic
scholarship, right? Playing hockey?
Figure skating.
Mm-hmm. Jade!
Warren, don't scream.
Hi.
You look great.
Jade, uh, I have to tell you. This guy
is a big improvement over the last one.
- I think your mother and father would've agreed.
- My parents liked all my friends.
I'll be home by midnight.
She's in good hands, sir.
Uh... You forget something?
Oh. This is for you.
- I love lilies.
- Actually, it's an orchid. Uh, cymbidium orchid?
You put it in a vase
and drop an aspirin in the water,
it should last you
the whole week.
Or so I read.
Nice meeting you.
She just left.
- You look beautiful.
- So Warren fell for it?
- Mm-hmm.
David made quite an impression.
I think Warren's in love.
Yuck. Not my type.
I'm so over that
whole uniform thing.
I won't go home now, mama
Don't make a fool of me
You see, I am
the boogie-woogie...
- Christ. it's Needle nose.
Gotcha.
Give me the power,
I beg of you.
Give me the power,
I beg of you.
Awake!
Awake!
Awake! Awake!
Awake! Awake!
What a crock.
- Hey, Tiffany.
- What are you doing here?
Come on. Let me in.
I'll catch my death out here.
Promises, promises.
Whoa. Whoo!
Hey, how was your day?
Same old, same old.
- Oh, hey, check it out.
- What?
- Check it out.
- What is it?
- You mean who is it?
- Who is it?
You mean who was it.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. You really did
a number on him, didn't you?
What did you use? Was it
really bloody? Did he scream a lot?
Was he ha...
You know, Damien,
this guy looks awfully familiar.
I recognize
the nail polish.
- Shit.
- You never really actually killed anybody, did you?
Did you? Did you?
You pathetic worm!
Come on, Tiff.
I'm working up to it.
Aw, man.
You know, it took me
ten hours to make that thing.
- Damien.
- Yeah?
Could you do me
a favor...
and see if my lipstick
is under the sofa there?
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
Back on your knees.
Crawl.
Good boy.
Stay down on the floor
where you belong.
That's right.
There's nothing under here.
Charlotte.
- How did you get out?
Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.
Oh!
Ugh!
- Tiffany.
Well, here we are.
How long have we been
going out for now, huh?
What?
- Don't you think you've kept me waiting long enough?
- No.
Oh.
You know what
the French call an orgasm?
- Le petit morte.
"The little death."
Come on, Tiffany.
Let's die a little.
Ah!
Hi. I'm Chucky.
Wanna play?
- Where the hell did you get this thing?
- Got him from the cops.
He's the actual doll from those murders.
I stitched him together.
- You got to be kidding me.
- No, I'm not kidding you. Why would I kid you?
- I knew you were obsessed, but... Chucky? He's so '80s.
- I'm not ob...
- He isn't even scary.
- No, he's not. Yes, he is.
What are you
looking at, punk?
All right.
So, I was wrong.
I thought he'd make
an... interesting toy.
- Damien?
- Huh?
You wanna play?
Okay.
First, I do this.
Are you ready
for a menage a trios?
- What's that?
- I thought you understood French.
- Ow! Oh-ho!
Now you watch me.
Both of you.
You know, Damien, there's something
I never told you about Chucky.
- Don't tell me Schmucky is one of those dolls who wets his pants.
- Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
I wouldn't talk that way
about Chucky if I were you.
He has a very bad temper.
- Ooh!
- You see, we lived together for years.
Of course, that was
before the cops killed him.
That was before he passed
his soul into that doll there.
Boy, was he ever jealous.
Anybody even looked at me,
Chucky would take care of him.
Wouldn't you, Chucky?
We were gonna get married.
God, was he
an incredible lover.
- He was the best I ever had.
- Come on, baby.
He ain't big enough to take care
of a woman like you.
It ain't the size that counts, asshole.
It's what you do with it.
All right.
Hi.
Hi.
- How you been?
- Okay.
- You?
- Peachy.
Actually, to tell you the truth,
I've been kinda out of it.
I know. It took me
ten years to find you.
That is sick.
What are you doing
with this jerk anyway?
Ten years is
a long time, Chucky.
Besides, I was never
actually with him.
You know me.
I'll kill anybody,
but I'll only sleep with someone I love.
- You look great, Tiff.
- Thanks.
I mean it.
I gotta be honest.
I always thought
you were gonna let yourself go.
Come here.
Yeah.
Huh?
Stop it.
- Hmm.
All right,
you satisfied?
- Can I wait in the car, please?
- No.
All right,
Boogie Nights, you're up.
This is such
a load of shit.
You know we haven't
been drinking.
Well, then, you've got
nothing to worry about, do you?
Evening, Chief.
Seems like
a false alarm here.
That's okay, Norton.
Better safe than sorry, right?
- This is a new low.
- For you too.
- Get in the car.
- Bite me.
Jade, when you're 18,
you can go to hell for all I care.
But until then,
I'm stuck with you.
And I'll be damned
if I'm gonna let you embarrass me...
by ending up on Jerry Springer
with some trailer trash lowlife.
- You fuck.
- But you won't.
Not Jade anyway.
Not any more.
In the car.
You can't keep us
from seeing each other.
I'm the Chief of Police, sport.
I can do whatever I want.
So if, for example, I was
to run a blood test on you tonight...
and the results made you look like
Christian Slater on New Year's Eve,
you think anybody
would question me?
- He's bluffing.
- Try me.
I wish we really could
choose our own families.
David, you keep
your orchid dry now, you hear?
- Come on, sunshine.
"Try me."
Screw him.
If I were you, I would take Jade,
get the hell outta Dodge...
and never look back.
Look, Chucky.
I made Swedish meatballs,
your favorite.
Honey, you shouldn't have.
Well, I wanted everything tonight
to be absolutely perfect.
Tiff, what the hell
is that?
It's a playpen, silly,
for the nursery.
You know, Chucky,
I still have the ring.
- What ring?
- The ring, the one you left for me.
I found it on the mantel the night you
were killed. I've never taken it off.
Oh, that? The one I got
from Vivian Van Pelt.
- Vivian who?
- Vivian Van Pelt.
I dumped her
in the river, remember?
That ring is worth
five or six grand, easy.
You mean... you weren't
gonna ask me to marry you?
What are you, fucking nuts?
You thought...
You haven't changed.
You'll never change.
What the hell
was I thinking?
Now, the first thing we gotta do is
get me outta this body once and for all.
No.
I think I prefer you
like this.
You're kinda cute.
You're just like a little baby.
- Is the little baby ticklish? Is he?
- Stop!
- Is he? Is he? Is he?
- Stop! Stop!
- Is he? Is he? Okay. Mommy's tired.
Time to go to sleep.
Okay, I get it.
You're still hung up
on the domestic thing.
No problem.
We'll get hitched.
Sorry.
I'm not into short guys.
My mother always said
love was supposed to set you free.
But that's not true, Chucky.
I've been a prisoner of my love for you
for a very long time.
Now it's payback time.
You let me outta here
right now!
Sweet dreams, asshole.
I'm crazy
Crazy for feelin'
so blue
I knew
You'd love me
as long as you wanted
And someday
You'd leave me
for somebody new
Crazy for tryin'
And crazy for cryin'
And I'm crazy
for lovin' you
I'm crazy for tryin'
And crazy for cryin'
Jesse, honey, could you
give me a hand with this?
Yeah, okay, uh,
just a second.
Thanks, sweet face.
I owe you one.
- Yeah.
-  I'm crazy for feeling' so lonely
Shit!
I'm crazy
- Hi.
- Hi.
So, you movin' out already?
No such luck.
Oh, sorry.
You want me
to put that in the car?
Yeah, I'm just, you know,
taking some stuff to the Goodwill.
- It's heavy.
- Oh, yeah.
- What do you got in here?
- Oh, you know. A little of this, a little of that.
Stuff that's gone
out of style.
You ever look at something, and you realize
you are just sick to death looking at it?
That's how I feel
about that shit.
Here. In the trunk.
- In the trunk?
- You can do it.
Bend your knees.
Wow. You are strong.
Nice muscle tone. You work out a lot?
I've been doing
some push-ups...
- Sorry.
- No, that's okay. Can't hurt it. Might help.
Tiffany, where the fuck are you?
You got some company?
Nah, just babysitting.
Foul-mouthed little fucker.
Let me help you
with this.
Oh, um...
What are you doing
later on?
'Cause I was thinking...
maybe you and I could
go get a drink or something.
That is,
if you're up to it.
- No, no. I-I can't.
- Why?
- I'm seeing someone.
- Really?
All the good guys
are taken.
- L-I gotta go.
- Okay.
Bye.
Jesse?
- Treat her right, Jesse.
- Excuse me?
Treat her right.
Never take her for granted.
It's like my mother
always used to say,
"A woman spends all day
slaving over a hot stove for a man,
the least he can do
is the dishes."
She's kind of a philosopher,
my mother.
- Hmm. Take it easy.
- See you around.
W-o-m-a-n
B-I-T-C-H.
That is incorrect.
The correct spelling of "woman" is...
W-O-M-A-N.
Shows how much you know.
-
- Yoo-hoo! I'm home.
Oh! Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.
If you can't play nice,
I may just have to take your toys away.
I have a surprise for you. I've been
thinking about what you said...
about wanting to get married.
Yeah?
- I think it would do you good to settle down.
- Babe, this is great!
You won't regret it,
I promise.
I'm gonna treat you
like a princess.
- What's that?
- Your bride.
With this ring, I thee wed.
Oh, Chucky.
She's beautiful.
You are so dead.
Congratulations, Chucky.
Now, I'm sure you two kids
would want to be alone.
While there are still no leads in
the murder of Officer Bob Bailey,
evidence suggests that his death
may be linked to another body...
found earlier today.
Damien Baylock, whose real name
was Howard Fitzwater,
was dragged from the East River
this afternoon.
Detective Preston, is there a
connection between these two murders?
Could be.
- Possibly.
- Is this the work of a serial killer?
- Maybe.
- I didn't say that.
No, sir, you didn't, but what can
you tell us about these murders?
Nothing.
I can tell you that this used to be
a nice rural community...
She's alive! Alive!
The bride of Frankenstein.
I promise to love, honor and cherish
till death do us part.
I promise to love, honor and cherish
till death do us part.
You got that right.
She hate me.
We belong dead.
Give me the power,
I beg of you.
Awake!
Awake!
What a crock.
You son of a bitch!
What have you done to me?
You got your wish.
You're mine now, doll.
And if you know
what's good for you,
you are going
to love, honor and obey.
I wouldn't marry you
if you had the body of G.I. Joe.
Hey, Raggedy Ann, you looked
in the mirror lately?
Now's not the time
to get picky. Hmm.
Face it, Tiff.
You need me. Otherwise,
you're stuck like this for good.
I don't need you.
I'll look it up myself.
Oh, go ahead. Chapter six.
Page 217.
The Heart of Damballa.
What's that?
An amulet.
We need it to transfer
our souls into human bodies.
Okay.
And where the hell is it?
I was wearing it
around my neck...
the night those bastards
gunned me down.
It was buried with my corpse
in Hackensack, New Jersey.
- All right, let's go.
- Sure. I'll steer and you can work the pedals.
We're dolls, you dope!
Oh, my God! What are we gonna do?
Ay-yi-yi.
- Shut up.
- You shut up.
I don't get it.
Why don't you just mail the dolls?
These dolls are very special.
What do you mean,
"special"?
I mean there's 500 bucks in it for you
if you get 'em there by tomorrow.
No questions asked.
I'd do it myself,
but I have to take care of a friend...
who's mentally
incapacitated.
Yeah.
Yeah, I'll do it.
But I want a thousand.
Okay, sweet face,
I can give you half now,
and my friend in Jersey
will give you the rest.
Color me
your color, baby
Color me your car
Color me your color,
darlin'
I know who you are
Come up off
your color chart
I know where
you're coming from
-  Call me

On the line
Call me,

My love, you can call me

lover's lover's alibi

David, you remember
when you were seeing Brad Barker?
Oh! Vividly. Whoo!
You loved him, didn't you?
Yeah... I did.
What happened?
His mother found
a letter I'd written him.
She freaked,
and we haven't spoken since.
You know, Jade,
we get very few chances
in life to be happy.
You gotta grab the brass ring
when you can.
We don't have time
for this shit.
- Jade, I need to talk to you.
- Hey, Jesse.
- Hey, David.
- I want details.
Jesse, Warren will be home
any second. if he catches you...
- You know I'll never take you for granted.
- Jesse...
Like if you'd cook,
I'd do the dishes, right?
- What are you talking about?
- I'd do anything for you, anything at all.
You know that, right?
- Right?
-
- Yes. Yes, I know.
- Then marry me.
- What?
- Marry me.
Tonight.
- Warren would kill us.
- I don't care about Warren.
- That's why we're gonna disappear.
- Where are we gonna go?
- Anywhere you want.
- Well, what are we gonna do for money?
I got money.
- Where did you get this?
- You know my neighbor, Tiffany?
She's paying me $500 to take a couple
of dolls to a friend of hers in Jersey.
Jade, there's another 500
when we get there.
Oh, shit, Jesse.
What has that freak gotten you into?
I don't know. I don't care.
I can put a deposit on an apartment.
I'll get a job.
I'll help put you
through college.
I think
I'm gonna throw up.
Jade, marry me.
What do you say?
I say I do.
- Come on. Let's get you packed.
- Okay.
Aw, that's so romantic.
I give them six months,
three if she gains weight.
It's me.
His van is parked right in front
of my house as we speak.
Who the hell is this bozo?
What's he doing?
Screwing with our ride,
that's what.
Ah, what the hell.
I need the exercise.
Were you born with that knife
super glued onto your hand, or what?
- What are you talking about?
- For God's sake, Chucky, drag yourself into the '90s.
Stabbings went out
with Bundy and Dahmer.
You look like
Martha Stewart with that thing.
- Who the fuck is Martha Stewart?
- My idol.
And what does Martha tell you to do
when guests drop by for dinner...
and you haven't
had time to shop?
You improvise.
What about...
Predictable.
Hmm...
Uh...
Aha.
Who's there?
Ugh!
- Now!
-
Why does that look
so familiar?
See? Now, that's the work
of a true homicidal genius.
- Not bad, for an amateur.
-
Shit. Here they come.
-  Yeah!
-
- What do we do with him?
- I don't know.
What would
Martha Stewart do?
Here.
-  Come on. Help me.
- I am helping. He's heavy.
Wait.
Huh?
What's the matter?
- I could've sworn that door was locked.
- Come on. We have to go.
Oh, yeah!
Give it back
My, my
Shit!
I'm empty
-  And sad
-
Now what?
How you kids doing tonight?
Going somewhere?
Will you both get out
of the van now, please?
Officer Norton,
I have a question.
All this
following us around...
Is that covered by
your regular salary?
- Or does my uncle pay you extra?
- Extra.
Look, I'm sure you're
not a bad person.
I know that you're
just doing your job.
But couldn't you just
please give us a break?
I wish I could.
You seem like really nice kids.
It's nothing personal,
at least on my part.
But... the money.
- You're disgusting. Shut up!
-
Shut up, or I swear to God,
I'll fucking vaporize you!
- Ahh!
-
Come on. Take it easy.
- Take it easy. Come here.
- We're never gonna get away with this.
They're never gonna let us go.
It's gonna be okay. All right?
Now, why don't you go get us
something to eat for the road,
and I'll deal
with Needle nose.
- All right?
- Okay.
Ugh!
Ah!
Oh, that's bullshit!
- You know this isn't mine.
- You're in a lot of trouble, kid.
Now don't you fucking move.
Shit! Shit!
Figures you'd hitch us
a ride with the Fugitive.
Give me your lighter.
- What are you doing?
- Improvising.
Now, sit back
and learn from the master.
-  Chief Kincaid isn't answering.
- What? I just talked to him.
Rude fucking doll.
Come on, Jade.
-
- Norton?
- Are you still there?
-
- Norton! - Bye!
-
Jesse!
Jesse!
Jesse!
Get in!
Get in!
There they are!
Call the police!
Shit! Shit! Go!
Jesse, drive! Go!
Go!
Well, at least you haven't forgotten
how to show a girl a good time.
Where were you?
- Is that all you have to say?
- What do you want me to say?
I should think you'd have something
to say about what happened back there.
I got something to say.
I think you're fucking crazy.
I'm crazy? You say you'd do anything
for me, and this is what I get?
You don't think that I had anything
to do with that explosion back there?
- Didn't you?
- No.
To be honest, I was thinking
the same thing about you.
How could you think that?
You announced in front of a hundred
people that you wanted to vaporize him.
- Oh, it was a figure of speech.
-
You were just as quick
to accuse me.
- Hello.
- What the fuck!
David, I don't know
what the hell is going on around here.
The cops think
it's all cut-and-dried.
Think of Mickey and Mallory,
Bonnie and Clyde. You get the picture?
Mickey and Mallory? Bonnie and Clyde?
They were mass murderers, David.
Multiple murderers, actually. Mass murders
happen all at once, like at the post office.
Multiple murders
are serial killings.
Am I missing something?
Norton was just one murder, right?
They found a cigarette lighter
next to Norton's car.
Belonged to that cop
who got his throat slashed.
And there's another thing.
Jade, your uncle's missing.
- What?
- I know you two had nothing to do with this.
But maybe you should turn yourselves in
until they figure it out.
David, are you whacked?
Nobody is gonna believe us.
They're setting up roadblocks
at the border.
- You two had better lay low for a while.
- Thanks.
Did you see
Warren tonight?
Not since this morning.
- Did you?
- No.
-
-
Our little room on Seventh street
is getting cold
I saw a pattern on a blanket
just the other day
It looked just like
the pillow you threw away
Uh-huh
I just woke up
the other night
And now I know what to do
I guess I'll see you in hell
Yeah
- What are you doing?
- Do you trust me, Jade?
Of course I do.
-
-
Sucker.
I think they make
a cute couple.
And if you ask me,
it'd be a shame to break 'em up,
if you know what I mean.
Dearly beloved,
we are
gathered here tonight...
to celebrate the union
of two people in holy matrimony.
And what God
joins together,
let no man tear asunder.
Violence in movies and television...
- What is this shit?
- Never mind...
-
- Jesus, the music scene's gone to hell since I've been dead.
-
- That's more like it.
Isn't it beautiful?
I always dreamed of having
a big church wedding...
with bridesmaids and a cake
and my picture in the paper.
Not just the usual mug shot,
but something really flattering.
Tiff...
I'm sorry.
For everything.
Um, I guess
I can't complain.
I mean, I always wanted us
to spend more time together,
maybe do some traveling
and see the world.
Well, just look at us now.
Yeah. Life sure is
full of surprises.
-
-
-
-
Stop him!
- Kill him!
-
For better or worse,
for richer or poorer,
in sickness and in health,
- till death do you part.
-
Congratulations.
You may now kiss the bride.
Huh?
- A true classic never goes out of style.
- That was good.
Is it true that Jesse and Jade
may in fact be the serial killers...
that you've been tracking
for the past few days?
We can't confirm that
at this time.
The previous murders appear to be
the work of just one killer.
It's possible, actually... it's possible
that one of them is a hostage...
or simply unaware
of what the other is up to.
Detective?
For the time being, in the absence
of any other information,
these kids have to be considered
armed and extremely dangerous...
First thing tomorrow morning,
we deliver the dolls.
We collect our money.
- We're gonna need it.
-
Oh! Excuse me.
The, uh, door was open.
I didn't realize there was
anybody in here. Russ!
I thought we were
getting a suite.
Whoa. Who's this?
- I thought we were getting a suite.
- No. This is our room.
Oh.
Oh!
Russ!
Look. Have you ever seen
anything so cute in your whole life?
What a great idea
for a wedding gift. She's beautiful.
Oh.
Well, this little guy has a face
only a mother could love.
Hi. I'm Chucky,
and I wouldn't talk if I were you.
Hi-de-ho.
Chucky! Of course. I remember.
He was a Good Guy doll.
- They were programmed to say all kinds of shit.
- Ooh.
Well, I don't
like him at all.
You know, you two make
a really delicious-looking couple.
- Hey, Diane, don't you think?
- Oh, absolutely.
I mean, imagine what their children
are gonna look like, huh?
Listen,
it's getting late, and...
So, what are you guys
up to tonight? Hmm?
-  It's our wedding night.
- What are you watching TV for?
Well...
you see, it's our
wedding night as well,
which is what makes this
just so perfect.
You know what they say:
The more, the merrier.
Okay, yeah. No.
You know what? We're really tired.
Gotta get to bed early.
- Well, we'll be right next door.
- Okay.
-
- That thieving slut.
She doesn't deserve
to wear that ring.
- To us.
- Oh, Russ, give me a break.
We are, technically,
on our honeymoon, remember?
Yeah, well, it was your idea
to come here, not mine.
I told you we'd have
seen more action at Club Med.
-
- Come on, we're here. Let's make the best of it.
Ooh!
-
-  Yeah, baby, come on! Yeah, come on!
Huh?
I love you.
I should have asked you this
a long time ago.
Tiffany,
will you be my bride?
Oh, Chucky.
Yes. Yes!
Ah!
Oh!
Chucky!
Why are you crying?
I always cry at weddings.
Oh, my God! I'm crying!
I wonder if all
the plumbing works.
Well, I don't know
about you,
but I'm starting to feel
like Pinocchio here.
Ohh!
I am anatomically correct,
ya know.
Ohh!
Oh! Oh!
Wait. Wait.
- What? What?
- Have you got a rubber?
- Have I got a rubber?
- Yeah.
- Tiff!
- What?
Look at me.
I'm all rubber.
Oh, that's right.
Wait.
L-I thought
you were plastic.
- Tiff.
- What?
- Kiss me.
- Okay.
Hello?
- David, it's me.
- Jade!
- Where are you?
- Niagara.
The Honeymoon Sweets motel,
which, believe me,
is even worse than it sounds.
- Are you okay?
- No. I'm married.
- Is that bad?
- I'm really scared.
I think maybe
he did it, David.
- I think Jesse has totally lost it.
- Jesus.
What should I do?
- Are you sure?
- Pretty sure.
Then you've got to go
to the police.
I don't think I can.
I still love him.
Is that wrong?
-
- Hold on a second.
-
- Hello?
- David, it's me.
- Hey! Jesse!
I'm sorry to call you so late.
I got a problem. It's Jade.
Listen to me.
Go to the police.
Now, before
somebody else gets hurt.
Yoo-hoo!
Anybody here?
Housekeeping!
Hello? Housekeeping.
Joy to be here.
Okay.
Oh, my goo...
Newlyweds.
What the heck went on here?
- Oh, I can't do this.
- What?
L-I can't go
with you, Jesse.
Not any more.
Oh, man,
I'm glad you said that first.
- Why?
- Jade, this is too much for me.
I love you.
I will always love you.
But there is a limit
to how much I can take.
Would you please stop talking to me
like I'm the one who's crazy?
- You're the crazy one! You're the mass murderer!
- You mean "multiple murderer."
- So you admit it?
- No, I don't!
I can't take this shit any more!
Anyway, the thing
that struck me...
was how sure
you both sounded.
And to me, that meant
one of three things...
one of you is lying,
both of you are wacko,
or both of you
are wrong.
Add to that the fact that I know you
both better than anybody else,
and I've never seen
either of you so much as hurt a fly,
and I've concluded
that what we have here...
is a terrible
misunderstanding.
Do you guys smell something in here?
Okay, for the sake
of argument, if it wasn't you...
and it wasn't me, then who else would
want to kill Warren and Needle nose?
And those people
from last night.
You're assuming Warren's dead.
He's only missing.
- You're suggesting that Warren...
- Yes! Why not?
I'd buy him as a psychopath
before either of you two.
Pooh!
Something really stinks in here.
I told ya not to leave
your dirty socks back there.
Honey, this ain't no dirty socks.
- I feel like such an idiot.
- Me too.
I mean, I-I can't believe I
actually thought that you could kill someone.
I know. I'm so sorry.
David, what would we
do without you?
What do you mean,
"without me"?
I mean you set us straight.
We owe you one.
- You're a good friend. The best.
-
Pull over!
Pull over now!
David, come on, buddy, it's me.
Come on, let's talk this over.
- I'm not your buddy.
- Fuck, David! Please put the gun down!
- Why? So you can kill me too?
- We didn't kill anybody!
Oh, you're good. You're good!
You even had me fooled.
- What are you talking about?
- This!
You son of a bitch!
- David, I didn't do it. She did it!
- I would never...
Shut up! Shut up!
Hey, help! Over here!
-
- Nobody move!
Oh, my God!
-  No!
-
That works too.
Get this heap of shit moving!
Now! Now! Now!
I imagine at this point you two
must have a lot of questions.
You do know who I am?
- Chucky.
- And this is Tiffany.
I believe we've already met,
haven't we, sweet face?
S-So h-how did you
end up like this?
- Well, it's a long story.
- It sure is.
In fact, if it was a movie, it would take
three or four sequels just to do it justice.
What are you gonna
do with us?
- Funny you should ask.
- These bodies are okay.
But they're like apartments
that we're just renting.
- But now we're movin' on up.
- Like George and Weezy.
-  And we're lookin' to buy.
- And you know...
what they say
about real estate...
location, location,
location.
Well, you guys are definitely
in the right place...
- at the wrong time.
-
This is a special report.
The Jesse and Jade case
keeps getting weirder and weirder.
Fingerprints discovered
at two separate crime scenes...
have been identified
as belonging to...
Charles Lee Ray, the notorious
serial killer gunned down in 1988.
Now police confirm
that Ray's corpse...
will be exhumed from a Hackensack,
New Jersey, cemetery sometime today.
- What?
- Chucky, the Heart of Damballa!
- I know!
- What'll we do? What'll we do?
Shut up!
Just let me think, okay?
First we gotta get
some new wheels.
Every cop within 500 miles
is lookin' for this van.
We need something
inconspicuous,
but with a little style.
Hold still, honey,
or I'm gonna poke you in the eye again.
Yes. I believe I'm going to look
absolutely ravishing.
Excuse me.
Nobody makes Swedish meatballs
like you, babe.
- Peachy!
- Thanks, honey pot.
- I hope you left room for dessert.
- You know it, poky.
You know, if I had known that
marriage was such a great gig...
I would never have waited
this long to tie the knot.
On the other hand, she's not
much of a housekeeper, is she?
-  Tiff?
- Huh?
Those dishes aren't gonna
wash themselves, you know.
You were nice enough
to cook for him.
The least he could do
is wash the dish.
- What are you doin'?
-
- What would Martha Stewart say?
- Fuck Martha Stewart!
Martha Stewart can kiss
my shiny plastic butt!
Here I am slaving away
over a hot stove,
making cookies,
making Swedish meatballs, and for what?
For a man who doesn't
appreciate me!
For a man who can't even wash
one fucking dish!
For a man who isn't even
a man at all where it counts,
if you get my drift.
Take it from me, honey. Plastic is
no substitute for a nice hunk of wood.
I didn't hear her
complaining last night.
Any guy would need a hunk of plastic...
probably battery-operated...
to get a reaction
out of you in bed.
And by the way, where the hell
did you learn to bake?
How dare you
speak to me that way!
- You started it!
- I did not!
-
- No!
-
-
-
- Whoa!
Jesse! Jesse, please!
Please! Oh, God!
Jesse?
-
-
- Get me out of here!
-
-
- You bitch!
-
-
Jade!
Hurry!
- Go, go, go!
- Not without you!
I'll be right behind you!
- Hey, beautiful.
-
Aah!
Jade!
- Move it!
-  Ow!
Ow! Ow! Ow!
Oh, ow! Ow, ow, ow!
-
-
Get down there. Move!
Open the coffin, Jade.
- Hurry up!
- I'm trying, you fucking midget!
-
-
-
- Ugh!
You really didn't need
to see that.
Give me the amulet!
Bitch!
- You broke my neck!
-
- Let her go!
- Let Jade go first!
Get movin'.
And Jade?
See ya real soon.
Get out of here.
Why can't I ever get it on
with the real good guys?
You're a lucky girl.
Catch me, Chucky.
Ugh!
- Aah!
-
- God, no!
- Pull it out.
-
-
I'll take that.
It's show time!
Give me the power,
I beg of you!
- This is it.
- I love you, Chucky.
I know.
We belong together...
forever.
Kiss me.
- Hah!
-
Why?
Oh, Chucky,
look at us.
Don't you see?
We belong dead.
Good-bye, darling.
I'll see you in hell.
-
-
My mother
always told me...
love would set me free.
Get off my knife!
Let me see your hands!
- Drop the gun! Drop it!
-
Let me out! Let me out!
Let me out! Let me out!
-
- Whoa.
-
-
- Don't move!
-
Go ahead and shoot.
I'll be back.
I always come back!
Yeah, but dying
is such a bitch.
No one's ever gonna believe this.
You know that?
What's gonna happen to us?
-
- Preston. Yeah, I'm here now.
I'm afraid we've got
another corpse to add to the list.
Jesse and Jade?
Hell, they didn't do it.
Just get Forensics
down here.
You're never gonna
fuckin' believe this.
Right.
You two go on home.
And stay put.
Let's go home.
Ooh.
Jesus.
-
-  Goddamn!
-
- Son of a bitch!
Holy...
Bitch!
Jesus!

Here's to my mother
From her tribe
I have crawled
Get on my feet I walk
three steps then I fall
Don't try to save me, mama
Don't kiss my wounded knees
I won't go home now, mama
Don't make a fool of me
You see I am
the boogie-woogie king
Yes, yes
Take my hand
Take my other hand
Take my hand
Take my other hand
Take my hand
Take my other hand
Take my hand
Boogie-woogie king
from the mountaintop
Is what I am
The boogie-woogie king
from the mountaintop
Is what I am
The people watch me
ride this wicked mule
From its stall
Into the streets where
a thousand eyes stare at all
What do you see now, mama
This wicked mule and me
Or do you see a child
try to get a gal to leave
See, I am
the boogie-woogie king
Yes, yes
Take my hand
Take my other hand
Take my hand
Take my other hand
Take my hand
Take my other hand
Take my hand
Boogie-woogie king
from the mountaintop
Is what I am
Yes, the boogie-woogie king

Boogie-woogie king

Boogie-woogie king
from the mountaintop
Is what I am
We belong dead.
Abductions
and mass torture
Create emotions
of vengeance
When the living
become the dead
Home invasion
Private party
of thieves
Blood spilled
material thrill
A sign of the times
Self-destruction
Self-destruction
A human disease
Jealousy killed the queen
Sliced her neck from ear to ear
Money and power
set the king free
A jury of his peers
let him be
Jealousy killed the queen
Sliced her neck from ear to ear
Money and power
set the king free
A jury of his peers
let him be
Jealousy killed the queen
Sliced her neck from ear to ear
Money and power
set the king free
Self-destruction.
Self-destruction.
That's more like it.
