Woman on P.A.:
TSA Employee:
Man on P.A.:
I'll be home in a few.
Get off in about an hour.
Space cadet, get me a...
Man on TV:
Man:
Woman on P.A.:
Man on TV:
-
-
Woman:
Elizabitch, get your
bony ass over here.
- What is going on?
- Don't hang up on her.
Woman on P.A.:
Put security cameras
in the whole house.
- Except for the bedroom.
-
Christie wouldn't
go for that.
My pool cleaner's
even gone rogue.
No, I'm serious.
Yeah, it's jumping out
of the pool on its own.
Man on P.A.: There is a flight 3598 to Manchester,
New Hampshire.
- Woman:
- Hey, it's me.
Just got off the plane.
What are you doing?
What am I doing?
I'm picking up Johnny at school.
I'm getting a sitter
from the bus stop.
Going back to the lab because
we got completely slammed.
Sharon, they made an offer.
For all the rights
to "Night Traveler."
We're talking about
graphic platforms,
That's amazing, Clay.
Congratulations.
Yeah.
Well, you know,
it's a big deal, yeah.
So are you going out
to celebrate tonight?
Yeah, this is
a big night for you.
I just assumed you'd want
to celebrate with someone.
Not really.
So you're not
with someone?
No. No.
Hey, is that Dad?
Can I talk to him?
- Hi, Dad.
- Hey, buddy.
- How you doing?
- We did the parachute drill today.
- Yeah.
- You put a little parachute on your bat.
I swear, my swing is like
That's great.
Are you coming home?
Yeah, yeah, soon.
- I just want you to come home.
- Ah, shit.
Hi, Shar, it's me.
Yeah, I ran out of juice.
Listen, there's a flight
Clay, you've been gone
for over a year.
I love you,
but it's not that simple.
I'd like to see my son.
- Shit.
- Operator:
- I need more money. Hold on.
-
-
-
-
-
-
- What's wrong with you? Stop it!
Get off him!
What are you doing? Get off!
Get off of her!
Stop that!
Woman:
Go! Go! Go!
Oh, my God, Chloe.
Hey, hey, hey,
don't touch her.
- I'm not gonna touch her.
- She might be contagious.
I need to call 911, though.
-
- Hello? Hello?
Let me see your goddamn hands!
Get your hands in the air!
Why'd you do that?
What, are you gonna shoot everybody?
- What the hell is happening?
- Who the hell knows?
- Quick, let's go.
- Don't use your cell phone.
- Why?
- They did.
- Woman: Help me!
-
No, no, no.
Bro, stop, he's normal.
Hey, hey, hey!
Come on.
Let's go, bro.
Bro, come on.
-
- Don't use your cell phones.
Man:
We need to get out of this airport right
now before it burns to the ground.
Man:
Is there a driver
on this train?
- That'd be me.
- Clay:
- No.
- Man:
Central shut down the power,
emergency brakes came up,
and this train can't
move more than 50 feet.
- Shit.
-
- We could walk.
- Woman:
Man:
- What did you say?
- We could walk.
I got maps of the system
and I got all the maintenance
tunnels with the exits marked.
We can walk
right out of here.
That's a brilliant idea.
You're my new best friend.
- What are you gonna do when the
T starts running again? - Let's go.
You don't want to come,
you don't got to come. I don't care.
You guys are idiots.
We're safe right here.
Only if this lasts less
than 24 hours.
- What do you mean?
- The groundwater.
The sewage workers
pump out the groundwater.
If nobody's manning the pumps,
whole system floods.
All of this
will be underwater.
You'll be forced into the terminal
or back out in the streets.
And if Boston is still burning
or if what he's saying is true...
Man:
- Do you want to stay here or do you want to go?
-
- These things always do.
- Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo. Can I come with you?
- I'm not gonna stop you.
- Yo, awesome. Deuces, man.
- You don't even know him.
- Adios.
Teenager: You think this is
happening everywhere or just here?
Driver: We'll know in a little while.
We lose power,
means it's happening everywhere.
Nobody's manning
the power stations.
Probably running
for their lives like us.
Wonder how many folks were on
those things when it happened.
A lot.
Too many.
Like everybody.
And those that didn't get it the first time got zapped
when they tried to call
Hmm.
I'm Tom McCourt,
by the way.
Clay Riddell.
Good to know you.
Mike Mattick.
They call me DJ Liquid.
- Keep moving.
- Tom: DJ.
I got to get to Kent Pond.
My family is up there.
I've got a wife and son. You know,
in New Hampshire. Kent Pond?
You got anybody
you need to check on?
- I got my boo.
- Did you say "my boo"?
- Yeah, what you got, huh?
- Come on, come on.
My man, he done left me,
so I ain't got nobody. I live alone.
Yo, I got service.
What does that mean?
I don't know.
Put that thing down.
Are they normal?
- They look normal to you?
- I don't know.
You want to take that chance?
What's abnormal?
-
-  Shit!
Come on! Run!
Come on, man.
Come on.
Come on! Give me your hand.
Give me your hand.
Come on. Come on.
The Dumpster.
The Dumpster.
I got it.
I got it.
Go. Go.
Hold it.
Clay:
- Okay, what floor?
- Two.
-
- Shit, hurry up!
Hurry up.
Yeah, dead.
Think it's safe to text?
I've got to text my family,
see if they're okay.
Can I borrow
your phone, please?
It's all jumbled up.
Why don't you stick
my phone in the freezer?
Probably need it
to check the signal.
You draw all these?
-
-
Tom:
DJ...
Liquid?
God damn.
people are gonna
have to put aside
If they can't,
they're gonna die.
Woman:
- She sound normal?
-
-
- Are you normal?
- Okay.
- I live upstairs.
Yeah, I've seen you before.
I'm Clay.
-
- I'm Alice.
I think you guys should close the blinds.
I don't think that's smart.
You guys should
close the blinds.
I don't think it's gonna be good
if somebody sees us in here.
He's gonna close them.
Tom, you close them.
- Are you hurt?
- What do you mean, am I hurt?
Are you physically injured?
Can I help you?
I killed my mom.
I killed my mom.
I want to get out of this dress because it really smells.
Like blood and sweat
and my mom's perfume.
My girlfriend
might have left some jeans.
I think they'd
just about fit you.
And I have pajamas.
I have plenty of pajamas.
Okay?
Yeah, I'm just tired.
Here, do you want
to maybe...
There's still some hot water
if you want to take a shower.
Uh-huh, okay.
Thank you.
Clay:
I think you and Alice should
probably come with me.
Clay, I'm really sorry
about your family.
Don't be sorry because there's
nothing to be sorry about yet.
My kid had a cell phone,
but he never made calls.
He just texted, you know?
Liked games.
But my wife,
she had one and I called her right before it happened.
When I met you.
So I don't know if she was on it.
I just want you to know I'm real
glad I ran into you today, Tom.
You okay?
Oh, um, I found
these in your pocket.
Hope you don't mind.
No, no, no, no.
Here, maybe
drink something.
- No.
- Do you want something to eat?
No.
If you guys go somewhere,
can I come with you?
Hoping you'd say that.
Clay:
Yeah.
I'm gonna try
and get some rest now.
Yeah, we'll be here.
Yeah.
So...
some kind
of terrorist attack
or some shit,
do you think?
I don't know, man.
Well, whoever it was,
us three are like bugs
who had the dumb luck
to avoid the stomp
of the giant's foot.
They're like birds.
Tom:
I don't like this flocking
thing at all.
I mean, whatever it is,
I've just got to get to Kent Pond
If you guys don't want to come,
I totally get it.
-
-
Hold up.
Hold up.
- Oh, shit.
- What?
- I don't know.
- Should we go back?
-
-
Woman: Oh,
my God! Help me!
-
- Oh, Jesus.
-
-
- Should we help them?
- No, no, no, no.
- Nothing we can do.
- We go back or we go right now.
No, go, go, go.
They're not looking.
- They're not looking. Go, go.
- Go.
Tom:
Where they all go?
Clay: Maybe we got lucky and they all dropped off,
you know,
when they lost the signal like at the train station.
Tom. Tom.
Always considered
myself a pacifist,
but I wouldn't mind
having a pistol right now.
Um, guys.
I don't think
that's a good idea.
Clay:
and just say
I want to talk.
Maybe ring the doorbell.
What's the worst that can happen?
I'm a black man
with a crowbar.
I'm not walking
over there.
Okay, how about
that one?
Oh, that makes all the difference in the world.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my.
Why don't you
take care of Alice?
Here, take this.
Uh-uh.
- What?
- Look at you.
Yeah, basic training.
You never forget.
Grab some ammo.
Clay:
You guys,
there's someone out here.
What?
He's by himself.
Close 'em.
Close the drapes.
Hey, are you okay?
Hello.
Hello.
Kid.
-
-
Clay:
I guess they don't
all travel in flock--
Fuck this.
Let's go.
Let's go.
What the hell?
Tom: Well,
it looks like when the sun goes down
they're programmed
to pack it in.
It was like they all
did it together.
Like it was an automated
response or something.
You know what I don't get
is how they all knew
exactly where
we were that fast.
Not with their own
eyes anyway.
Not with their own--
so you're saying when that kid saw us,
they all saw us?
How else do you
explain it?
- So now they're psychic?
-
Like maybe the pulse
flows through them
like they're this big,
organic, you know, network.
Alice:
Like a hive mind.
Yeah.
Clay:
Tom: What makes you think they're still there?
I mean, no matter what
or how it went down,
don't you think
they might have bailed?
Clay: If they're safe,
they would have left a message.
Lost most of my money in the great collapse of '08.
And I lost my emotional stability
in the great divorce of '09.
You know, at the time,
I thought that was the end of the world.
- Whoa, what is that?
-
- You hear that?
- Yeah.
It's music.
Greetings, gentlemen.
Miss.
Welcome to Gaiten Academy.
If you folks need a place to stay for the night,
we have plenty of rooms.
The boys who didn't have
cell phones have all run off.
Oh, we know about that.
I'm Jordan.
I'm a scholarship boy.
- I lived in Holloway.
- Good for you, Jordan.
Yes, sir.
That's what the Head said, too.
Charles Ardai.
Headmaster.
Quite a problem these cell phones have caused now,
isn't it?
The devil's intercom
is what I used to call them.
Nice.
It's apt.
Clay:
What's with the music?
Did you ever play
musical chairs as a child?
- Yeah.
- Well, as long as the music doesn't stop,
we've got nothing
to worry about.
We'll have a quick peek,
then we'll go over to Cheatham Lodge for dinner.
It's not 200 yards to
Tonney Field, I promise.
Alice:
Charles:
Tom:
Observe.
- What the hell are you doing?
-
Charles: No, no,
he's calm. He's calm.
Nor would those around him
spring to his defense.
Of course, if I tried
it in the daylight,
they'd tear me limb
from limb.
The music comes from
their mouths, too.
It's not hardly a whisper,
but you can hear it.
- Come here.
- That's got to be your imagination.
- There's no way that they're actually talking.
-
It's like
they don't breathe.
I can hear it.
I can hear it.
How is that even possible
without a transmitter?
They are transmitting.
It's a new skill they seem to have picked up.
And they're changing
at an alarming rate.
Alice: Can we please move this conversation inside?
Please.
Charles:
They appear
to be eusocial.
Like a colony
of bees or ants.
There's no competitiveness,
no selfishness.
In fact,
they may be the next stage in human evolution.
Every human
on planet Earth
will be part
of one giant organism.
No individuality.
No privacy. Come on.
No war.
No resource depletion.
- No conflict.
- No, thank you.
open-eyed and listening
to their music,
we think
they're rebooting.
Yeah, I mean,
they might as well have
"software updating,
please stand by" blinking on their foreheads.
You mean they had
their brains wiped?
Yeah, I mean,
what is a brain?
It's just a big
old hard drive.
Organic circuitry.
it would say something like
Holmes, you astound me.
- I love cybernetics.
- Ah.
Cyberpunk fiction, too.
William Gibson.
Clay:
Neal Stephenson is a god.
Yeah, he's pretty good.
Right now
the nights are ours.
But what happens if they decide
that they need less sleep?
What happens
when they're not
afraid of the dark?
What are you suggesting?
I think what's happening now is
more than temporary anarchy.
I think it's the start
of a war.
But what does one
do in a war?
One kills one's enemies.
Well, even with
the guns we have,
it'll be slow work.
We have a gasoline pump
in our little motor pool.
Gasoline may serve
to end their lives.
Hold up.
You want to napalm them?
to keep our playing
fields very green.
I want to wipe them out.
I agree with him.
I think we should wipe them out.
As many as we can,
as fast as we can.
Before it's too late.
We sure we want
to do this?
Oh, yeah, for sure.
Let's go.
I'm sure.
Whoa.
Holy cow.
All right.
Do you like first-person
shooter games?
Yeah.
Pretty freaked out,
huh?
I'm fine.
How about you?
Freak city.
- Oh.
-
Tom:
No, no, no.
It's great.
Put it in a lower gear.
Yeah, it's not like I've done this before,
all right?
Just put it
in a lower gear.
Yeah, we were just on somebody's head or something.
All right.
They're coming back.
No, you've had enough of that to be DUI.
You know that, right?
Yeah.
But it won't
really count
after the mass
murder, you know?
No one knows better than me
that you can't stop progress.
But still, you're never
too old to fight it.
-
- Uh-oh.
Holy shit.
Alice: Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Shit, the truck.
Get down!
Alice, you all right?
Yeah, yeah,
I'm fine. I'm fine.
Shit.
Ardai!
No!
Help.
Help him.
Somebody help him.
Tom. Clay.
Help him.
-
- Okay.
No.
Come on, buddy.
Come on. It's okay.
All right.
- Tom: What is that?
- Yeah, I feel it, too.
It feels like rage.
We got to go right now.
Tom: Do not withhold your mercy from us,
O Lord.
May those
who desire ruin
be turned back
in disgrace.
"Aha.
Aha..."
be appalled
by their own shame.
The dust of the Earth.
Jordan:
Clay:
-
- Yeah.
I thought when you get older,
the nightmares go away.
No, they still happen.
They just grow up, too.
There was this
really creepy,
disgusting guy
in my dream.
- What?
-
Does he have
a tear on his cheek?
Alice:
and calling me insane.
In a red hoodie?
Pushed me in front
of a speeding train.
The guy in my dream,
that's the character
from my graphic novel.
You know, my comic book,
"The Night Traveler."
He's the guy in the drawings on
your wall of your apartment?
Yes. He's a, you know,
prophet of the apocalypse.
So you saw
all this shit coming?
Hey, it was just
a comic book, man.
Unless this is just all
my goddamn dream.
You may have had it first,
but you're definitely not the only one.
It's getting dark.
Let's get out of here.
- Alice:
- Yeah, I don't want to sleep no more.
Clay:
Maybe No-Fo means
no phones.
Like a dead zone.
No cell phone towers, so it's safe.
You can't assume that.
It's too early to think we know the rules.
Open up!
We're Americans.
Clay:
Ooh, company.
You're cute.
You're cute.
You, sir,
are very cute.
Thank you.
And you, my love,
are to die for.
No phoners
come through here.
Phoners don't like English food.
English people
don't like English food.
- Hey, I do, mister.
- All right, all right.
What the hell is Kashwak?
What do you guys think that is?
Oh, you know Kashwak.
Up in Maine.
Everybody's going there.
Everybody who hasn't been pulsed.
We're going.
We're leaving tomorrow.
Thanks for letting us
come in tonight.
Mmm, we're happy
you're here.
We're really glad you're here.
You think Bob Dylan's
a phoner?
That's a good one.
Tom:
That would-- that would
be apropos, right?
¶ There's something
wrong with my line ¶
¶ When I call
my baby's number ¶
¶ I get a click every-- ¶
Oh, D2. D2.
That's like the devil
of ego, right?
The vanity of
super individuality.
But the other one was
this one called Arama.
And he was, like,
a demon of big data.
-
- Yeah.
-
-
Tom:
you know, I was lost,
drifting and...
somebody reached out
their hand
and they saved my life.
All I know is
that I didn't
survive a war
and all the rest of it
just to get pulled in
by this fucker
or his flock.
it wasn't dreams,
it was in his house.
On the wall.
You drew him.
I'm not the first guy to draw a devil on a piece of paper.
- Tom:
- Yeah.
- How's it end?
-
I mean, it's like
a serial graphic novel.
Didn't really end.
It was just a game and a story.
- Just a game?
- Mm.
Good always
conquers evil.
Now, I believe that.
You know, and I saw you
with your son once, too.
And I always wanted that.
Anyway, I saw you leave your
apartment with that woman
and I just really
hated that.
-
- Liz.
Hated that.
Always seemed like
you were pissed at me.
I never knew
what was up with you.
You'd give me
that death stare.
Yeah.
I give everyone
the death stare.
But I know you
love your family.
I've seen you
with your son
and I know that shit
happens with couples,
just--
You're gonna
find him, Clay.
You're gonna find him.
You think?
You are.
'Cause I had him.
And I had her.
I had some bullshit job
that I hated
doing graphic design
for some stupid company.
and I hated Sharon for loving me when I hated myself
and all these warped,
convoluted feelings.
Sometimes
I'd get home from work
and I'd change into
my rock and roll T-shirt
and I'd go to the bar and smoke weed
and listen to Norwegian death metal
like some teenager who wanted
to blow up his high school.
It was pathetic.
Then one day I just split
and moved out.
And do you
like being there?
First night I was there,
I knew it was a mistake.
Very first night.
I called Sharon
the day of the Pulse.
I couldn't tell her
I missed her
and that I wanted
to come home.
I said I want
to see my son.
See, I had to prove I was right and
to prove I was special, you know?
I mean,
probably just wanted her to be proud of you.
Well, be great
if that were true.
I think I was
just an asshole.
Human beings are the religion of the angels.
And that is an angel in exile.
What do you think?
Clay:
Get out of my fucking bar!
Get off!
Get off!
Clay:
Hold on, Tom!
-
-
- Alice!
-
Alice!
Grab my blanket.
It's okay.
- Keep that over her.
-
It's okay, baby.
Okay.
Grab underneath her.
Come on.
Help me bring her up.
Help me bring her up.
Bring her up.
Okay.
Let it snow.
'Cause then we can
build a fort.
Or a leaf.
Or a bird.
We can build a bird.
We can make
a snowman.
Or we could play
the slinky one.
I'm so sorry, buddy.
You know, back in the tavern,
they attacked at night.
The Head said
this would happen.
He also said they'd find new ways
of maintaining their numbers.
You saw what happened
back there, right?
They're not just killing anymore,
they're recruiting.
The pulse is coming
from their mouths now.
They don't need
phones anymore.
Well, well, well.
Man:
And, well, here you are.
- Who are you?
- Why don't you put your shotgun down, my friend?
I'll be happy
to tell you who I am.
I'm Ray Huizenga
from Groveland, Mass.
This young lady here,
Denise Link from Haverhill, neighboring town.
Meetcha.
Ray:
What matters-- what matters is what we do.
And what we do, hmm?
We kill phone freaks.
Yeah, yeah,
we kill them.
Just like you.
Denise:
Ray: That's when we started
seeing those Kashwak No-Fo signs.
Denise:
The area got an Indian
casino built there last year
and finally put up
a cell phone tower.
The phoners are trying to draw us there in our dreams,
but it's a trap.
Ray: Yeah,
and the dreams started coming after we blasted.
I mean, we blasted.
That first flock, we blasted them.
- You know, powerful dreams. Powerful dreams, like--
- Tom: We've had them.
Ray:
-
- Yeah.
Got to be taken down.
I mean down.
Like, down, like--
like right there.
We've got to take him
all the way down.
You know what I'm saying?
You take him all the way down.
They'll stop.
Just... poof.
They get inside
of people's minds.
They get inside
your mind, Ray?
No, nothing in my mind.
Because I stay up, hmm?
- Clay:
- Denise:
She sleeps in there,
I'm out here guarding.
I'll pace all night.
I'll be all over this park.
- Mary had a little lamb. She's my Mary.
- Aw.
-
- Denise:
Ray:
That's great.
Sounds like you guys are in a good place.
Oh, yeah.
But you know what?
We can resist as long as we stay awake.
Staying awake is key.
We just stay away from the flocks.
How you plan
on doing that?
Ray: Oh, we got ourselves a canary in a coal mine,
my friend.
Hey, Denise, you want to show them and
I'll finish cooking the burgers with your son?
Denise:
I still hate
to see him like this.
- He's a phoner?
- Yup.
that broke off from
the herd and got lost.
On its own, he's nothing.
He just sits here and waits for
them to come back and find it
or else he dies.
God, he hasn't
been eating.
Come on,
don't do this to me.
If a flock passes
within a mile or so,
he starts coming to
and acting up.
The closer they are,
the crazier he gets.
That's why we got
him covered up.
We don't want him showing them where
we are and bringing them down on us.
Sometimes I think he can
still recognize my voice.
- You think they can be rehabbed?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Johnny's voice: Are you coming home?
Are you coming home?
- Tom: What the hell's going on?
- Are you coming home?
I have no idea.
He never said anything before.
Are you coming home?
Are you coming home?
- That's Johnny's voice.
- No, it's not.
- Tom:
- Are you coming home?
You know
that is not your son.
-
- Hi, Dad.
-
- Denise:
Tom:
-
-
He'll lead the rest of them to us.
Come on.
Ray: Hey,
we all need to go now.
- Tom:
- Ray:
Why are we
stopping, Ray?
Ray:
At first it was in my dreams,
but now I'm seeing stuff when I'm awake.
Things that aren't there.
You haven't slept for a week.
Maybe you were hallucinating.
I'm hallucinating because that asshole in the red hoodie
is putting thoughts
in my mind.
And what the Prez wants,
he's not gonna get
because you're
not gonna let him.
They thought it was me,
but it wasn't me.
It wasn't me, it's you.
He was wrong.
What's that around
your neck, Ray?
I don't like it that you're
holding on to your kid
because your kid is done.
Your kid is done.
You know it in your heart
that your kid is toast.
- Your kid is toast.
- No, I don't.
I don't know that.
Oh!
Here. Here.
I'm passing the torch.
I'm passing it on to you.
When the time comes,
call the number on the slip.
You'll know the time.
I hope you know the time.
- What time is that, Ray?
- The end of the road time.
The end of the road.
Mmm.
No other options.
Ray, what's that
around your neck?
- This, my friend, this is gonna--
-
This is gonna blow my mind.
You better step away, my friend.
- Okay. Hold on.
-
-
-
Stay here.
I'll be back.
No, no, no, no.
I'm going with you.
No, no, no.
Just stay with them.
I've got
to do this alone.
Johnny!
Sharon!
Get off.
Get off.
Fucker!
Yeah.
So what you got there?
That?
Ray gave that to me.
Right before
he blew his head off.
When the time came?
Uh-huh.
When's that?
End of the line.
That's what he said?
Seemed like
a reasonable man.
Did you know
there was a bomb in here?
No, or I wouldn't
have ridden in it.
So did Ray tell you
this thing was full of C-4?
There's enough plastique in there
to blow up this whole fucking block.
- Denise:
- Here, this is Sharon's wagon.
It's in the garage.
I'm going to Kashwak.
Are you out of your mind?
Did you not hear
what Denise said?
It's a trap.
We've been through this.
Maybe.
Come on, man.
If you're going there,
you're not coming out.
It's a suicide mission.
You're gonna die.
I got to find my kid.
I got to know
one way or the other.
Oh, God damn.
Take this.
I want you to spray paint T,
J and D
for Tom, Jordan,
and Denise
on the side of the road
every couple miles.
If you go off-road,
dirt road,
put it up on a tree.
Always on the left-hand
side of the road
'cause that's where
I'll be looking.
Look, don't go.
It's stupid.
You're gonna die.
Hey.
You remember the story
of Orpheus, buddy?
Orpheus traveled
to the underworld
to find his loved one,
bring them back to Earth.
You're not Orpheus.
Take care
of yourself, brother.
Be right behind you.
All right?
Take care of Tom.
You know, you're about
the best friend
anybody could ever have
at the end of the world.
Well, let's hope
it's not quite the end.
Good knowing you,
Clay Riddell.
Good to know you,
Tom McCourt.
- Take care.
-
Jordan:
Sorry about your wife.
- Kashwak, please!
- Pull over!
- Please help us!
- Please help us! Please!
Take us with you!
Johnny's voice: Hi, Dad.
Hi, Dad. Hi, Dad. Hi, Dad.
-
- Clay:
-
-
Clay:
Johnny!
Look, Dad,
there's another.
Mm-hmm.
I'm so glad you get
to meet my friends, Johnny.
Are they gonna be
my friends, too?
You bet.
What's the name
of the place we're going?
Canada.
