Babe? Fire's starting
to go down.
Would you please go get
some more firewood?
Come on. I'm tired.
Come on. Please?
It's starting to get cold. Aw.
I'm getting cold. Oh, hey!
Come on.
Hey, just remember I have the keys,
and I'll leave without ya.
Hey, okay. All right.
I'll get some wood.
Yeah, I'll get some.
Great.
Mmm. Thanks for bringing back
the wood, babe.
You know, this last guy
wanted the ultimate.
You should have seen what his
idea of “the ultimate” was.
I mean, I thought
I've seen them all,
but this guy had something
that was a new one even on me.
So, um, how you doin' tonight, kid?
You look a little down.
I need one more trick
to make my rent.
Hmm. I know how that is.
Oh, here's somebody.
You wanna go out?
How much?
Twenty-five's regular.
Fifty's French and regular.
For 75, I'll take you
around the world.
Hey, uh, don't forget
“the ultimate.” Yeah.
How much is that?
For a hundred bucks,
I'll give you the ultimate, baby.
Let's go.
You're on.
See you later.
All right.
It's cold outside, Al!
So? Bundle up.
People who don't pay their bills, they
take it on the arches. Shove it!
Get lost.
Yes, can I help you?
Give me my favorite room, AI.
You got it.
Okay, that's 25 for the room.
If you'd like a color TV, Mr. Packard,
another five bucks.
And 35 with the tax.
All right.
Okay.
You joining us
for continental breakfast?
What can I do for you, sweetheart?
How corny, AI.
Put the money on the dresser,
sweetie,
You ever model?
Yeah, sure.
Show me.
Like what?
Like in the magazines.
Like this?
Yeah.
Or like this?
Yeah.
Like this?
Mm-hmm.
Like this?
Hot stuff.
Come on, honey.
The meter's tickin'.
I got money.
Lots of money.
Want me to model for you
some more?
No.
Leave your clothes on.
Okay.
Anything you want.
I want you to have a good time.
I can%.
Relax.
There's more than one way
to skin a cat.
Right?
Right. Right.
Uh!
You like that, honey?
No.
I love it.
Uh!
Oh, you're so good.
You know, I like this
with my clothes on.
Yeah.
You're good!
Ooh!
Yeah. Hey-
You bitch!
What-
What are you doing?
Stop it!
What are you doing?
Stop it!
Stop it! Aah!
Please, baby!
Stop it!
Stop it!
Help!
Why didn't you stop me?
Mommy. I didn't wanna do it.
I didn't wanna do it.
Mommy. I didn't wanna do it.
Why'd you make me do that?
I didn't wanna do it.
I didn't wanna do that.
Christmas shopping, Mr. Zito?
Yes, Terry.
Miss me?
You're gonna like it here.
Oh, yes.
I told you not to go out tonight,
didn't I?
Every time you go out,
this kind of thing happens.
This has got to stop. it's silly.
And it's not getting us anywhere
You think they don't know?
They do.
I heard it, and I know.
They all know,
and I don't like it any more.
But you don't listen, do you?
It's got to stop.
You'll like it here.
Oh, you're right about them.
All of them.
They're all the same.
I know what they're like.
Just because I can't do
the things you do...
doesn't mean I don't see it
all the same.
Fancy-schmancy.
And what are we supposed to do?
Sit and smile and, “Yes, miss,”
“No, miss,” “Not now, miss”?
“Whatever you say, miss”?
I know. I know how it is with their airs
and their looks and their-
They can drive a man crazy!
I di- I didn't mean that.
I didn't mean it that way.
It's just that they-
they don't know when to stop.
They never know when to stop.
That's why they have to be stopped.
It is. You're right. You're right.
But not like that.
Not that way.
Please.
They'll take you away from me.
You have to be careful.
You have to listen to me.
We can't live like this.
I have to go out.
And each time, it's like this.
I get so scared
that they'll take you away.
But they won't...
if you do what I say.
They won't take you away.
Not ever.
Not ever, I swear.
Not ever.
Polly want a cracker?
Hmm? Hmm?
I'll be right back.
JV'
Hello.
ls your, uh- ls your boyfriend
waiting for you tonight?
Are you kidding?
Of course.
He's gonna have
a long wait.
Um-
Well, here we are, huh?
My boyfriend's gonna kill me
if I don't get home soon.
Your boyfriend isn't here.
This is really a nice place, isn't it?
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah. Yeah.
Do you come here a lot?
Mm-hmm.
Oh.
Hmm.
You wanna meet me someplace?
Where?
The back seat.
Sure.
- You're great.
- You are.
I see something.
It's your boyfriend.
No! Let's get outta here.
There's somebody out there.

Start the car!
Come on, let's go.
Start the car. Start the car!
...what
happened at the governor's mansion in Albany yesterday
This is George Garrison
from On The Spot News.
Right now, we are live
over midtown Manhattan.
bringing you the latest update on one of the most
violent killing sprees in our city's history.
Following yesterday's brutal slaying of a
young couple under the Verrazano Bridge,
New York City Police Commissioner Paul Delaney
has assigned a special task force...
of over two dozen detectives to join in on the manhunt for
a madman who has left five dead in the metropolitan area.
The peculiar yet brutal
disfigurement of the bodies...
has led police to believe that one man
is responsible for the killings.
50 ﬂair, witnesses are few,
and detectives are stumped for clues.
Back in local politics,
Assemblyman Anthony Ventura-
You tell me what I should do.
I heard about it.
I always do.
I can't go out for a minute.
it's impossible.
Fancy girls...
and their fancy dresses
and their lipstick...
laughing and dancing.
But you stop them, don't you?
I can't stop 'em.
But you do, don't you?
Then they can't laugh,
and they can't dance any more.
So you got to stop,
or they'll take you away from me.
I won't ever...
let them take you away from me.
You're mine now forever-
and I'm so happy.
And, uh, I got on TV.
Denise, be careful.
Don't swing so high.
Okay I won't.
All of my friends
were so surprised.
Denise,
you wanna ride our bikes?
My mother said
I can't leave the park.
Oh, come on.
Come on.
Okay.
Be careful, little girl.
Pat, are you sure Jerry and I
can't give you a ride home?
Oh, no, thanks, Kath.
Ken'll be here in a second.
And if not,
I'll splurge and take a taxi.
Well, here's the newspaper, if you
wanna read it while you're waiting.
Are you sure you don't need it?
I wanna check my horoscope.
No, I already read it
this afternoon on my break.
Oh, I hate reading the newspapers these days
with that kook running around. Yuck.
I know. That guy's really a sicko.
I hope they catch him soon.
Yeah- Oh, be sure and check Mr. Gannon's I.V.
on your shift tomorrow.
He, uh, pulled it out
again tonight.
Not again.
He's too much!
I will. I'm so cold.
Here's Jerry.
Okay.
- You sure I can't give you a lift?
- No, thanks.
Okay.
See you tomorrow.
Night!
Hi.
Open!
Open up!
Oh! Oh!
This is what you like, baby,
isn't it?
This is what you like, isn't it?
Yeah, this is what you like.
It's nice, isn't it?
Huh.
You're getting very careless-
blood in your hair.
Tsk, tsk, tsk.
What will people say?
What will we do?
You want to look pretty, don't you?
Pretty for me?
You're so pretty.
J';
J';
Who is it?
Yes, uh, my name is Frank Zito.
You took my picture in the park.
May I speak with you?
Come in.
That's- That's amazing.
I was just looking at a photo
I took of you in the park.
Really? Well, uh, it's a coincidence, because
what I wanted to, uh, speak to you about-
Do you mind if I take a look?
Certainly.
Here you are.
Thanks.
Listen, um-
Listen, how come
all your models are women?
Well, it's just something
I'm interested in as a woman.
In fact, this is my fourth series.
It's called Woman Four.
Mm-hmm.
Not very original, is it?
Well, it's not the title
that matters that much.
No. No.
Listen, do you get to, uh,
keep them all?
I'm hoping to sell them.
I wouldn't. I-I'd keep 'em forever.
But Why?
I mean, part of my profession
is to sell photographs.
It's not all for art's sake, you know.
I know, but why do you take pictures
of women this way?
I like to make them look beautiful.
No. I think it's more
to preserve them.
You see, the beauty
is already in the model.
Frank, don't be silly.
Listen, I'm the photographer, right?
Right.
So I should know
what I'm doing, shouldn't I?
I know, but to me, you know,
things change, people die.
But in a painting or a picture,
they're yours forever.
There's no way you can
possess someone forever,
even in a photograph.
There's no way.
Well, I was noticing this picture
of this old lady here.
At one point in her life,
she was someone's sister,
someone's wife, someone's mother.
And when the photographer took her picture,
he had her the way he wanted her.
She could never leave him.
She couldn't grow old,
and she couldn't die.
Tell me, Frank.
What do you do for a living?
Um, I'm a painter.
Yeah?
Abstracts, some still lifes, some landscapes.
You know, things like that.
I'd love to see some of your work
sometime.
You would?
I'd love to, yes.
Listen, uh, Anna,
I know this place over
in New Jersey, you know?
Yeah?
Clams Casino.
Italian food.
Mm-hmm.
And, uh-
Would you like to have dinner?
Why, Frank,
are you asking me for a date?
You talkin' to me?
I'm talking to you.
I'd love to, yes.
I really would.
- Give me five minutes, and I'll be right with you.
- Great.
jj, You're the
most beautiful woman I've seen since, uh, my mom.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Thanks.
Have you got a picture of her?
Yeah.
Mmm.
Here. it's when she was younger.
Oh, right.
Tell me, where does she live?
Oh, we lived in Queens, but, uh,
my mother was taken from me...
in an automobile accident
when I was younger.
I'm sorry.
She really was lovely.
Mm-hmm.
Mmm, it's a shame.
Listen, Frank.
What?
Rita's coming to the loft
tonight at 9:00,
and I want to get
all the work finished.
So she promised me
she'd work overtime.
So, in other words, it's an early night.
Is that it?
It is really.
Well, as long as I can
see you again, I mean-
Yes, of course.
Great.
What about tomorrow night?
Tomorrow night?
Let's see if I'm booked.
No, of course tomorrow night
would be great.
But I know you're very busy, and I'm
sure that, uh, something will come up.
I might be and, then again,
I might not be.
Oh, but I'll definitely see you
on Thursday at the show.
No kidding.
You'll be there.
Yes, and so will
five million other guys.
Oh, Frank.
What?
Are you annoyed?
No.
I mean, that would be ridiculous,
wouldn't it?
Yes, it would.
Mr. Steiner's doing this-
He's having this really big celebration.
He's asked all these people
from Art  down,
and it- it could be something
really special for me.
I understand.
I wish you the best of luck, Anna.
I know you do. Yeah.
L- I just hope
you really do understand.
Do I have a choice?
Mmm.
No. Not really.
No.
Well, figures.
No.
That's it. Oh!
That looks so good.
Closer together.
Okay.
Hold that.
Yeah, that's it. Smile.
- j Goin' to a showdown j

What's the matter? What's the matter, Lou?
Jenny-jenny's dress
doesn't work.
Who did her makeup? Who did her makeup?
They did it themselves. Why?
Listen, we gotta do something with it.
lt's just not right.
You don't like it. Okay, okay.
The necklace, everything.
Yeah, he's right.
That's giving too much ﬂare, Rita.
Better take it off.
Oh, it's my mother's.
I know, I know.
I like it, but-
Take it off, okay?
Frank.
It's really good to see you.
Yeah, well, I came by.
I took the invitation.
I hope I'm not disturbing anybody.
Not at all. No.
I brought you a present.
Thank you very much. Sit down.
Yeah. Thanks. Thank you.
Now, what's this?
What do you think of the session?
I think it's fabulous.
Oh. Oh, my goodness.
Oh, he's beautiful.
Oh, I love him.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Mm-hmm.
By the way, this is Rita.
Rita, come here.
- It's the girl you saw in the photograph. Remember?
- Oh, yes. Nice to meet you.
You're more beautiful in person than you are
in your photograph. I love it.
Anna, listen. I'm sure you and your
friend have a lot to talk about,
but we're paying these models a hundred
dollars an hour. I know. I know.
I would like to get back to the shoot.
I know. Okay.
Could we please start? Thank you.
Fine. Be right with you.
Okay, Frank, you can stay
as long as you like.
- Thanks for the bear.

Yeah?
Did you lose something?
Oh. Oh, where'd you find this?
Well, I got it at the studio.
I figured you need it,
so I brought it over.
It was nice of you to bring it by.
Thank you.
Well-
see ya.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Why do you do these things?
I don't understand
why you do these things.
Don't lie to me!
You try to pretend
you don't know.
Your hair is different.
Yeah.
And you look different,
but you can't fool me.
I know it's you.
I don't want to hurt you.
I only want to talk to you.
Okay?
I'll take it out if you promise
not to scream. You promise?
There. That's better.
There. You can trust me.
You know you can.
There's no reason for you
to try and run away.
But now we're
back together again.
And I'll never let you go.
Never.
Now, you were wrong
to try to hurt me.
You left me alone
lots of times.
I was scared.
Real scared.
I hid in the closet.
Did you know that?
No, you didn't know that.
I was afraid
that you wouldn't come back.
But I won't cry now.
Uh-uh. No.
I knew you'd come back.
You did come back.
I found you.
I knew I would.
And now you're mine,
all mine.
Why did you need those other men?
They didn't love you.
I did. I loved you.
I needed you.
There were so many men.
I never wanted to hurt you.
I never wanted to hurt you.
Never.
But there were so many men.
There was- So many men.
Why?
Because they gave you some dollars?
But they didn't love you.
I loved you.
Only me.
Don't kill me. Don't kill me.
Frank, don't kill me.
No. No.
I'm not going to kill you.
I'm going to keep you...
so you'll never go away.
I'm just going to keep you...
so you won't go away
ever again.
Mommy.
Oh, Mommy.
Mommy.
Oh, Mommy.
Oh, Mommy!
Mommy.
Not tonight.
You ain't goin' out tonight.
Tonight, you stay home...
with me.
You know, when Mommy tells you to...
hide in the closet,
you have to do what Mommy tells you...
or else you know what happens.
J', P
J';
- Hello.
- Hello, Anna. This is Frank.
I was wondering if you'd like
to take in a show tonight.
Sounds like a good idea, Frank.
Could you be ready
in about 15 minutes, say?
- I can be ready in 10.
- Okay, I'll see you.
Okay. Bye.
What's that for?
Oh, it's just to thank you.
Thank you for sending the-
the ﬂowers for the funeral parlor and-
and for attending the funeral.
Rita didn't have many friends,
and I really appreciated it.
It's okay.
Look, I was wondering if we could
stop by the cemetery.
I want to pay my respects
to my mother.
I usually drop off a wreath- I have it
in the back seat- at Christmas time.
Would that be all right,
before we go to dinner?
Of course.
Fabulous.
Mmm.
Thanks
Name of the Father, Son, Holy Ghost.
Amen.
Hail Many, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.
Blessed art thou amongst women, and
blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.
Hail Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners
now and at the hour of our death. Amen
Hail Many, full of grace,

It hurts.
My head hurts.

It was a long time ago, Frank.
Rita knew.
What do you mean?
Rita knew.
What do you mean?
She's mine forever.
What are you talking about, Frank?
Rita knew! Rita knew!
Frank!
This is me! Anna!
Rita knew!
Frank! Frank!
Rita knew!
Mother!
Mommy, Mommy Please don't
lock me in the closet.

the closet.
