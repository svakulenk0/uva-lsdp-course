Happy holiday
Happy holiday
Merry Christmas, bud.
Thank you.
Merry Christmas to you.
Okay. Hi, Chief.
Come in.
Hello, honey.
Well, this is
our last night in show business.
Some feeling, huh?
Some feeling.
I got the ring
and the license.
Honey, we're ready.
Oh.
Say, there's
a hook left over at the top here.
Should that be?
Never mind,
I'll take care of it.
Jim?
Huh?
Well, I think that
tie's terrible.
Well, who cares?
Tomorrow I'm a farmer.
You'd better
go change it.
Listen, honey,
when you're flipping those twinkle toes
who's gonna be
looking at my tie?
You only have
five minutes. Hurry.
Okay, I'm on my way.
What'd he say?
I didn't tell him.
Why not?
We love each other.
You wanna
continue dancing.
I know,
but he gets a look.
Oh, he's always had
that look.
It doesn't mean
anything emotionally.
It has something to do
with his liver.
Simply tell him
you had made a mistake.
You don't wanna
give up your career and live on a farm.
But he's already
bought the farm.
And the license,
and the ring.
Oh, I can't tell him.
All right, I will.
Right after our number.
Listen, darling,
don't weaken.
Think of our life
together.
Think of diamonds,
of sables,
of your own
little penthouse.
Is that a promise?
Well, just think
about them for the time being.
MAN: Ready, Miss Dixon.
Well, thank you.
Say, this thing
didn't come out even.
Oh, I'll fix it.
We have to hurry.
I love you.
I love you...
...and Jim.
I love Jim, too.
But after all, I mean, let's not be too chummy.
Here she comes
down the street
My, oh my,
ain't she sweet?
Why, here comes
my hot toddy
Over my dead body
I'll capture
her heart singing
Just wait until
she gets a load of my dancing
Just wait till
I start singing
I'll take her strolling
down the road with my dancing
I can't go wrong,
a tender song
And she'll discover
my charms
Some fancy taps
and she'll collapse
And fall right
into my arms
I'll capture
her heart singing
Oh, no,
you haven't a chance
When I go
into my dance
I'll take you
through life singing
I'll make you
my wife dancing
If you could dance
instead of sing
I'd learn to
love you somehow
If you could sing
instead of dance
I'd take you home
with me now
The way you sing
don't mean a thing
You'd better stick
to your dance
And as for you,
your dance won't do
You'll have to
sing for romance
I'll capture her heart...
I'll capture her heart...
Singing
Dancing
Not much of
a Christmas present for you, is it?
I mean, both of us
walking out on you.
Don't worry
about me, kid. I'll do all right.
What a chum.
Can't you see what
we're walking out on? The grind.
When's the last time
you had as day off?
I don't know.
Maybe last year?
Do you ever hear
of Thanksgiving
or Labor Day
or the Fourth of July?
Vaguely.
You know what they are, don't you?
They're holidays.
Days of rest.
There's lots of 'em.
They mark 'em in red
on the calendar
so you can't miss 'em.
What happens in
show business when a holiday comes along?
You give
an extra performance.
Not for me, brother.
Lila and I are
going up to that farm in Connecticut
and we're gonna live
by the calendar.
Say, Jim?
Mmm?
There's something
you should know.
Oh, I know, Ted.
I feel the same way about you.
You know, we've had
our ups and our downs
and we fought a little
over the women
we swiped from
each other, but...
I know, but...
Sorry, Jimmy boy, but that's life.
Ted, if I'm not
the best manager in the business
I'll eat a garage
mechanic's shirt.
Fifteen weeks
at the Park Club,
sight unseen,
for you and Lila.
$200 a week more
than you were getting with the farmer thrown in.
What's the matter?
I haven't told him.
You haven't told him?
You haven't told him?
Haven't told me what?
What... What's this? What's the news?
Well, don't be upset,
Jim, dear.
It isn't that
I don't love you. I do.
I love everybody,
but when Ted
explained how much he loved me and...
All at once,
we both realized that we belong together.
The two of us,
dedicating our lives
to making people happy
with our feet.
The two of you, huh?
Dedicating your lives
to making people happy with your feet.
That's sweet.
Well, I guess that
kick I just got was a good start, huh?
Sorry, Jimmy boy,
but that's life.
Yeah, it's best that
you found out now, Jim.
You wouldn't wanna
make Lila unhappy.
Oh, no. No, I...
I wouldn't want to make Lila unhappy.
Not now, now that
I really know her.
What a narrow
squeak that was.
What do you mean
by that?
Oh, nothing.
Nothing, honey.
I'm just happy
that you're happy.
That little speech
sounds like the crack of a confederate money.
Well, kids,
I'm still gonna rejoin the human race.
I hope you get
a lot of work, holidays included,
dance yourselves
into beautiful nervous breakdowns.
You ever want to look me up,
you know where to find me,
Midville, Connecticut,
under a large shady tree,
just being lazy.
Lazy
I want to be lazy
I long to be out
in the sun
With no work
to be done
Under that awning
They call the sky
Stretching and yawning
And let the world
go drifting by
I want to peep
Through the deep
Tangled wildwood
Counting sheep
till I sleep
Like a child would
With a great
big valise full
Of books to read
where it's peaceful
While I'm killing time
Being lazy
So Lazy Acres
was a snare and a delusion, huh?
Oh, brother,
there's the hardest work in the world.
Maybe you'd be happier
back in town, Jim.
Of course, if you get that
agricultural urge again,
you can always
raise a geranium.
Oh, no.
Wait till you hear.
I think I've dreamed up
the greatest idea I ever had.
And you've had some pips.
Oh, but this can't miss.
I'm turning
the farm into an inn, but what an inn.
Here, read up, brother.
"Holiday Inn,
Midville Connecticut."
Open holidays only?
Mmm-hmm.
Say, how many
of those are there?
There's about 15.
That gives me
He would
think of that.
Did you get your
discharge papers from that sanitarium?
Oh, don't you worry,
this is gonna work.
I'm having auditions
out at the farm every day.
Say, if you run
into any talent
that's willing to work
for a share of the table,
will you send them out?
Sure, soon as I get back.
I'm flying down to
Miami Beach tonight
to set an engagement
for Ted and Lila.
Lila.
You forgot to
order the flowers.
Now, don't get excited,
there's a flower shop out at the airport.
I guarantee to have orchids
in her dressing room before her first number.
Oh, boy, you better.
As I remember,
this kid even expects presents on Father's Day.
Yeah.
Well, good luck, Jim.
So long, Ted. Have a nice trip.
I mean, yeah,
thanks, I will.
That reminds me,
I forgot to give him a little
Christmas remembrance
I brought along.
Got one here
for each of you.
Say, this is swell.
What is it?
It's homemade
peach preserves.
I put them up myself,
just before I went into the sanitarium.
Boy, do I go for those.
Why, they're great on...
Or even plain.
They're
non-fattening, too.
Well, it's a long trip
back to the farm, I think I'll get along.
Will you say hello
to Lila for me?
But you gotta wait
and catch the act.
We got some new routines
and then after the show...
I don't think they like
this nightclub air.
Wait. Wait. You better
wait for Lila's.
I think Danny's
was the loudest.
Well, different tone.
Dawn patrol, huh?
Hello! Am I too late?
You would have been
in another minute.
Danny Reed.
Listen, I have to
wait on that man.
But...
I'll work five nights for you. Anything.
Just leave me alone
and don't butt in.
What would you like?
Orchids,
the finest you've got.
Corsage?
No. No. A dozen.
Loose, looking like
they don't care.
All right.
There,
"Lila, love, Ted."
Have them delivered
to Miss Lila Dixon
at the Club Pierre
before 11:00 tonight.
Oh, I'm sorry,
but our delivery truck is on its last trip
and won't be back
until after 11:00.
How about
a messenger boy?
Oh, it's impossible
to guarantee delivery this late on Christmas Eve.
But to help you out,
I'll take them.
Oh, there you are.
A dozen orchids,
please.
Lady, you're a lifesaver.
Here. Here's $5.
Take your boyfriend out and show him a good time.
Oh, thank you,
but let's consider this a personal favor.
Well, I can't leave town
indebted to a stranger.
Would you like to
see the floor show at the club tonight?
Oh, I'd like to
very much, but...
All right, now you just
give this card to Francois
and he'll seat you at
the entertainer's table.
Why, you're Mr. Reed.
Uh-oh.
I'm Linda Mason.
Well, this is just a part-time job.
Actually,
I sing and dance. Mr. Reed, I want...
I know. I know,
you've studied dancing since you were a little child.
You spent long weary hours
in every theatrical agency in Broadway.
But just now I happen to
be catching a plane to...
Of course, once you
told me I was no good,
I could probably get
a job at a bargain basement and like it.
Now look, honestly,
as soon as I get...
Oh, of course.
Sure, you worked hard, you want a chance.
So what? So I'm gonna
give it to you.
A job?
Uh-huh.
A friend of mine
is opening a place
in Connecticut,
Holiday Inn.
You take that card
out there tomorrow,
tell him I sent you
and you'll be all set.
Mr. Reed, how could
I possibly thank you?
Don't.
Just deliver those orchids and let me catch my plane.
This table's reserved
for the band.
Excuse me!
Fussy, isn't he?
I think I'll have
a bowl of coffee, huh?
And the lady?
Coffee.
We seem to be on
the 40-cent tour here.
It is embarrassing.
I'm Jim Hardy.
Linda Mason.
Got a friend
in the show?
Well, I'm here at
Mr. Reed's invitation.
Oh, Danny.
Then you know
Ted Hanover.
What?
Yes, naturally.
Oh, my.
He's quite a man with
the ladies, that Ted.
Well, after all,
he's a very attractive man.
Do you know him?
Oh, yes. Yes.
Matter of fact,
I've been considering Ted
and his partner
for my new club.
Oh, you have a place.
Oh, yes. Yes.
I don't know, though.
His act might not go
so well at a place
as large as mine.
Oh.
Well, I've found
that the size of a place doesn't matter,
if one has sufficient
personality.
That's what
you found, huh?
You in show business?
I'm Linda Mason.
Oh, Linda Mason.
I could dance nightly
Just holding you tightly
My sweet
I could keep right on
Because you're so light
on your feet
You're easy
to dance with
CHORUS:
There is no doubt in
The way we stand out
in the crowd
Though it's called dancing
To me it's romancing
out loud
You're easy
to dance with
Loving you
the way I do
Makes you easy
to dance with
That is why I'm always
right on the beat
All those charms
in one man's arms
Make you easy
to dance with
I can hardly keep
my mind on my feet
CHORUS:
Let's dance forever
Come on, say we'll never
be through
It's so easy
to dance with you
You're easy
to dance with
You're easy
to dance with
It's so easy
to dance with you
CHORUS:
It's so easy to dance
It's so easy to dance
With you
That was wonderful.
Oh, it's a great act,
isn't it? Here they come.
Who?
Ted and Lila.
Hey, what's the matter?
Hello, Lila.
Jimmy boy.
How are you?
I'm so glad to see you.
It's good to see you.
I thought you
were alone, Jim.
Who's your friend,
and what's her hurry?
Don't ask me,
she's your friend.
Mine?
Yeah.
What is she afraid of?
Facing me?
Darling, I swear,
I never...
"Darling, I swear."
You lie...
You're on.
So this is Holiday Inn.
Yeah. Will be
if it ever opens up.
Well, why shouldn't
it open?
Well, I ain't one
to talk,
but you could probably
buy a half interest
in this place for
a barrel of apples.
Next train for
New York's at 7:43, if I can flag her down.
Say,
I'm looking for a job. Where's the boss?
Right here,
I'll be down in a second.
So, you're the big shot
that didn't know
whether Hanover and Dixon
were good enough
for your place.
Well, that wasn't
exactly hay you were throwing, either.
"I'm Linda Mason."
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
All right,
you're a fake and I'm a phony.
And we're both soaked.
Are you hurt?
I'll check later.
Come on,
let's get out of this before you catch cold.
All right. Ooh.
Well,
here's what cooks.
Oh.
Well, this is darling.
Was it as large as this
when it was a farmhouse?
Yeah, it was built
by a fellow who felt cramped in New York.
He finally ran out
of lumber, though.
Oh, Mamie.
MAMIE: Coming.
MAMIE:
Is your names Mamie?
No.
No.
Get back in the kitchen.
My, my.
What's happened?
Oh, we had
a little accident.
Mamie, this is
Miss Linda Mason. How do you do?
Please to know you,
Miss Linda.
And these are
her children.
That's Daphne,
and that's Vanderbilt.
LINDA: How do you do?
Mamie,
will you take Miss Mason up to the guest room
and change her into
anything that'll fit her
while we get her
clothes dry, huh?
Sure thing, Mr. Jimmy.
Come on, honey.
I'll see about
getting the fire ready in the living room.
Is your names
Miss Linda?
No.
No.
LINDA: I don't know,
it sounds like something you dream about at night
and it would
be wonderful,
then you'd wake up
in the morning and realize it couldn't work.
Oh, it'll work,
if I can sell the idea to some performers.
They seem to think
that profit sharing
means taking bows
on an empty stomach.
So that's why you're
not open tonight.
Well, I'm also,
sort of, particular
about the kind of
talent I'm gonna use.
Fifteen holidays a year.
Mmm-hmm.
You're a lazy fellow.
No, not especially.
Just have my own
ideas about living.
My father was like you.
Just a man with a family.
Never amounted to much,
didn't care.
But as long as
he was alive
we always had
plenty to eat and clothes to keep us warm.
Were you happy?
Yes.
Then your father was
a very successful man. Hope I can do as well.
Say, I came out
here for a job. Could you use me?
Well, I might find
a spot for you
in my first show.
What can you do?
I sing a little
and dance.
Couldn't guarantee
any salary at first,
right now I've got
the ledger and an iron lung.
I don't care if
you pay off in eggs, just give me a chance.
Well, let's see
what you can do.
Thanks. Thanks a lot.
You know,
I've written special music for each holiday.
This sort of gives me
a chance to keep a little promise I made to myself.
I said I was
gonna sing this song at the inn tonight.
I'm dreaming
Of a white Christmas
Just like the ones
I used to know
Where the treetops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells
in the snow
I'm dreaming
Of a white Christmas
With every
Christmas card I write
May your days be
merry and bright
And may
all your Christmases
Be white
I'm dreaming
BOTH:
Of a white Christmas
Just like...
Just like the ones
I used to know
Where the treetops glisten.
Where the treetops glisten
And children listen.
And children listen
To hear
To hear
BOTH: Sleigh bells
in the snow
I'm dreaming of
a white Christmas
With every
Christmas card I write
BOTH: May your days
be merry
And bright
And may all your
Christmases
Be white
Happy holiday
Happy holiday
While the merry bells
keep ringing
May your every wish
come true
Happy holiday
Happy holiday
May the calendar
keep bringing
Happy holidays to you
If you're burdened
down with trouble
If your nerves
are wearing thin
Park your load
down the road
And come to Holiday Inn
If the traffic
noise affects you
Like a squeaky violin
Kick your cares
down the stairs
And come to Holiday Inn
If you can't find
somebody who
Would set
your heart a-whirl
Get in your car
and motor to
The home
of boy meets girl
If you're laid-up
with a breakdown
Throw away
your vitamin
Don't get worse
Grab your nurse
And come to Holiday Inn
Happy holiday
Happy holiday
May the calendar
keep bringing
Happy holidays to you
Happy New Year, Ted.
No!
Francois, have you
seen Mr. Hanover?
Twice, sir.
What happened?
The first time, sir,
he came
from his dressing room with a telegram in his hand.
He ordered
Scotch and soda, a bottle of each.
I know, I know.
What then?
The second time he came
from his dressing room
he asked which way
is Connecticut.
Connecticut?
Connecticut.
He said he has
a friend there who knows about women, too.
Why didn't you stop him?
How could
I stop him, sir, when I don't know
which way is
Connecticut.
Who said Holiday Inn
wouldn't work?
Well, we're gonna divvy up
a stack of important money tonight, huh?
Man, man.
I've got a landlady
who's gonna ask for your autographed picture.
No.
Everybody get something?
All right,
come on, now.
Go to bed, now,
it's getting late.
Good night.
Good night.
Look, it's almost time.
JIM: Say, it's practically
straight up, isn't it?
One minute to midnight
One minute to go
One minute
to say good-bye
Before we say hello
Let's start
the new year right
Twelve o'clock tonight
When they dim the light
Let's begin
Kissing the old year out
Kissing the new year in
Let's watch
the old year die
With a fond good-bye
And our hopes as high
As a kite
How can our love
go wrong if
We start
the new year right?
That's it.
That's midnight.
I'll see you out
on the floor, all right?
All right.
Come on, everybody.
Happy New Year.
Happy holiday.
Happy New Year.
I forgot my check.
You won't need that,
but I think you'll need your coat.
Happy New Year.
Same to you.
You got to dance.
Oh, you got to dance.
Come on, you got to...
Why, Mr. Hanover.
Mr. Hanover.
That's Mr. Hanover.
Wait a minute,
I got to go.
Oh, no, I don't
want Ted Hanover,
I want you.
This is New Years, kid.
I know.
Ted!
He wasn't drunk,
it's a gag.
What happened?
Ted Hanover with
his new partner.
They were great.
New partner?
You better get back.
Well, I am sorry,
if I'd have known how he was...
Oh, he'll be all right
in a week or 10 days. You better hurry.
Ted!
Ted!
Ted!
Oh.
How is he?
He's out cold.
Hot or cold, he can
keep his dancing shoes in my office.
Did you hear
that applause?
Yeah,
it went pretty good.
And I was worried
about his losing Lila.
Losing Lila?
Yeah.
Yeah, she eloped tonight
with some Texan from Texas,
with Ted's
engagement ring on her finger.
But who cares?
You lose one girl,
you find another. That's life.
That's good, huh?
Here we go again.
Come in.
Good morning, Ted.
Oh. Good morning.
Got a little head?
Where am I?
You're at Holiday Inn.
Well, how did I get here?
Who brought me?
You were clinging
to the undercarriage of a jeep, I think.
Here, have a slug
out of the mug.
You mean you don't
remember anything? Uh...
Let's see.
I had a wire from Lila
telling me she's going
to marry some millionaire or something.
I remember that all right.
Mmm-hmm.
Then I had a drink.
A drink?
Boy, you were fractured.
And then I decided
I had to talk to my old pal, Jim.
You don't remember
anything else?
No. That's all,
except that
I must have been killed
on the way out here or something.
You really come
up empty, huh?
Too bad about Lila.
I think you're better off
doing a single.
You're a born soloist,
you know.
Oh, no, no, Jim,
I've got to have a partner.
And when I find her...
Yeah, I know,
you'll fall in love with her.
You haven't missed yet.
Happy New Year!
Oh, don't do that.
Why didn't you tell me?
Letting me beat
my brains out worrying about his losing Lila
and all the time,
he's got this girl on the leash.
What girl?
Boy, you must
have been high.
Doing a complete
dance routine
with your new partner
and you...
You don't know
who she is?
I danced with
a new partner?
When? Where?
Here. Last night.
Think, Ted. Remember?
Wait a minute.
I remember.
I got here
just about midnight.
There was a girl.
We danced.
What she look like?
I... I don't know.
All I saw was a vague outline.
Can't you remember
anything about her?
I remember
dancing with her.
If I ever dance
with her again,
I'd probably
recognize her.
Great, that takes care
of everything but finding her.
You were here,
why ask me how she looked?
I only saw her from
the back. She was...
About this...
She had a...
If I ever saw her
from the back again, I'd recognize her.
Well, that's fine.
After I've danced
with her,
I'll just turn her around
for your okay.
This should be a cinch.
You saw her,
describe her.
Who, me? Well, I wasn't
watching very closely.
She was a medium...
Medium-built sort of a girl,
with a medium face.
She had a nice evening gown on
with a belt
in the back.
See, she was built
just like a girl friend of mine.
A girl you don't know
but her name was Consuela Stupkis.
She used to play
the pinball machine a lot down at the corner drugstore.
I remember one time
she was high man. Three weeks in a row.
Thanks. Thanks a lot.
That's nothing at all,
happy to do it.
See, I got a hunch,
fellas.
I've got a hunch
we're going to find this girl eventually.
And when we do
we'll be glad we waited for her.
Listen, I'm not interested
in getting any other partner, understand?
A chance meeting
in the night. Destiny.
She'll be back.
Here's where
we will find her on the next holiday.
Here?
Here.
I've got to go
turn the roast.
Now don't worry,
we'll find her.
If I see her
from the back again, I'll recognize her.
It's kind of
a roundabout way to go at it, but let's try it.
JIM: Are you decent?
Yes, come in.
What's that?
Well, I thought it over
and I believe that
our number'll go a little better in blackface.
Oh. I thought we were
going to do it like this.
Well, that's before...
Before I thought it over.
I look terrible
in the stuff. No.
I don't even know
how to put it on.
I'll put it on
for you.
I broke in
as a bootblack, you know.
Here we go.
Oh.
For a month and a half
I've been dreaming
of how pretty I was
going to look tonight.
Well, here's my punishment
for thinking so well of myself.
Oh, you'll have plenty
of times to be pretty.
I was just going to
ask you if you'd like
to be in the rest
of the shows out here.
You were?
Will you?
Will I?
Fifteen nights a year
Cinderella steps into her pumpkin coach
and becomes queen
of Holiday Inn.
Well, what's the matter?
I wish I didn't have
to work all the other days in the year
to make
these few possible.
Maybe a little later on
when we start doing better
you could stay out here
all the time.
Did you hear
what you just said?
Yeah.
Was it a proposal?
It will be when I get
a few bucks in the bank.
You're a strange duck.
You don't even
give me a chance to say darling
and throw
my arms around you.
Better save that
till you see the bankbook.
Well, I guess
I'm sort of engaged.
Say, what is this?
A daisy chain?
Well, we were just looking
for the back of a girl we don't know.

Who was it set
the darkie free?
Abraham
That's right, child.
Abraham
When troubles come
down from the shelf
Who's heart was
bigger than hisself?
Abraham
Yeah, ma'am!
Abraham
The country's
going to the dogs
They shouted loud and strong
Then from a cabin
made out of logs
The right man came along
And that is why we celebrate
This blessed February date
Abraham
Abraham
The U.S.A.'s

Yeah
To one whose name
was Nancy Hanks
Tell me!

Abraham
She gave this land
the finest son
JIM: That's what she did.
Who ever went
to Washington
JIM: Who dat?

Abraham
When someone told
him General Grant
Was drinking every night
He answered,
"Go see if you can't
"Get all my generals tight"
That's why we celebrate
This blessed February date

Good night.
I give up.
She's not here tonight.
You wait here,
I'll go up and see if Jim's seen her.
Gus is waiting
to take you to the station.
Remember now,
day after tomorrow, St. Valentine's Day.
Someone's coming,
we better use the other stairway.
Who is it?
Bill-collector.
Good night.
Good night, Jim.
You better get inside
before you catch cold. You haven't got a coat.
Well, I...
Go on.
I don't need
a coat now.
Hey, Ted.
Did you find the girl?
This is terrible, I wish
we could recognize her from the front.
I feel like a wolf.
Why, Ted.
Ted!
She's here!
Who?
I saw her!
This way.
Let go of my coat.
This way, shortcut,
shortcut. Come on.
Giddyap.
It's locked,
it's never been locked before.
Let's try
the other stairwell.
Let go of me,
let go.
Go ahead.
Well, we've lost
her again.
Did you get a look
at her face this time?
No, we're still working
from the rear.
How do you know
it was her? After all, she had an overcoat on.
I don't care
if she had...
How do you know
she had an overcoat on?
Well, she...
If she didn't,
look for a girl
with pneumonia.
Come on.
Let's get inside.
Say, Jim,
when's your next show?
Next show?
St. Valentine's Day, I think.
Day after tomorrow, huh?
Is it?
That's our break.
We'll get here bright and early
and stay
until we find her.
We'll make
an announcement
asking her to
identify herself.
We won't miss
next time. No.
Say, fellas, how did
you like the show?
Well, we were so busy
we didn't see much of it, Jim. Why?
I thought the people
seemed to like the blackface routine.
Yeah, they did.
Don't you think
a blackface number
on St. Valentine's Day
would be novel?
A what?
It's no good, eh?
Just an idea I had.
Well, good-bye.
Good-bye, Ted.
So long, Jim.
JIM: Bye, Dan.
JIM: Bye, Dan.
Hey, lady.
LINDA: Yes.
You know we open in an hour.
You haven't even had a rehearsal.
LINDA: Coming.
Oh, very smart.
You'll have to
talk Gus into buying a horseless carriage.
I spend half my life
between here and the station.
I think Gus will have
to face the machine age sooner or later, won't he?
Did you escape those
bill-collectors the other night?
Bill-collectors?
Oh, yes, temporarily.
Say, that reminds me,
I have a surprise
for you downstairs.
Well, thanks.
What reminds you?
Nothing, it's just...
I mean, I want you to remember the surprise
when those doggone
bill-collectors move in.
You sound sweet,
but you don't make sense.
The inn is
so romantic looking.
Nice? I posed for
those cupids myself.
Hello, boys.
ALL: Hi. How are you?
Paid-up cards
here tonight.
Where's the surprise?
Aha! Right here,
a little home cooking I whipped up.
Beautiful.
LINDA: "Be Careful
It's My Heart."
And I ain't
kidding, either.
I wrote this just
for you, honey.
Be careful,
it's my heart
It's not my watch
you're holding, it's my heart
It's not the note
I sent you
That you quickly burned
It's not the book
I lent you
That you never returned
Remember,
it's my heart
The heart with which
so willingly I part
It's yours to take,
to keep or break
But please,
before you start
Be careful,
it's my heart
Be careful,
it's my heart
It's not my watch
you're holding, it's my heart
It's not the note
I sent you
That you quickly burned
It's not the book
I lent you
That you never returned
Remember,
it's my heart
The heart with which
so willingly I part
It's yours to take,
to keep or break
But please,
before you start
Be careful,
it's my heart
I'm sorry, Jim,
I couldn't resist it.
Wonderful, she's prefect,
light as a feather.
You found her, Jim.
You're a pal.
Yeah.
Young lady,
do you realize
that we've been
searching for you for weeks?
For me?
Yes, ever since...
The girl in
the flower shop.
Yes, Mr. Reed.
Where have you
been working since New Year's Eve?
Here.
Would you mind
letting me in on your secret?
Oh, it's no secret.
Ted Hanover is looking
for a new dancing partner
and we've decided
to give you the job.
Oh, here now.
Wait, just a minute.
Oh, no hard
feelings, Jim,
I don't
blame you for trying. She is wonderful.
I feel as if I've
known her for months.
Oh. Same old
feeling, huh?
Let's see,
Washington's Birthday is the next show.
That will give us
a week of rehearsals. We can open the act here.
DANNY: I'll take care
of the invitations. Strictly formal.
I'll get all
the newspaper boys from New York.
Now hold everything.
This is my inn,
and I am not running it
for a bunch of stuffed shirts.
What would you like,
the dungaree set?
Well, that would be better
than the bunch of chowder heads you drag in.
Maybe I can't
use the act.
Not use Ted Hanover?
Well, the show is
pretty well set.
You're in,
but he's out.
But you could change
the show for a special occasion like this.
Of course he could.
He's just trying to hide his gratitude.
Jim, you better think
up a number for us.
Well, just what do
you visualize, Ziggy?
Ah, let's see.
For Washington's birthday
I see, sort of, a romantic costume thing.
Naturally.
Something that just reeks
with grace and charm,
you know? Mmm-hmm.
I think the music should
be sweet and gentle to...
Well, to create the mood,
each time I take her into my arms and kiss her.
That's it.
Don't you think
it's getting a little stuffy in here?
I could say
that you're homely
Just as homely as pie
But this is
Washington's birthday
And I've got to
say you're beautiful
'Cause I can't
tell a lie
I could say
that you're stupid
Nothing up
in your crown
But this is
Washington's birthday
And the truthful he
Of the cherry tree
Would look down on me
and frown
I could say that
I hate you if I try
But I've got to say
I love you
'Cause it's February
the twenty-second
And I can't tell a lie
Hit it.
Come in.
Well, honey, in spite
of what good old Jim tried to do to us,
your future
starts as of tonight.
Now where would you
like to go from here?
From here?
Yes.
New York, Havana, Rio?
We have our pick of engagements, you know.
But I can't
be your partner if you leave the inn.
Of course you can.
There's no reason for you to remain buried here.
There's a very
good reason.
I promised to be in
Jim's holiday shows for the rest of the year.
Ah, but he tricked
you into that
while he was
hiding you from me.
No matter how he did it,
I've promised.
Besides, well,
we're going to be married.
Married?
Now wait a minute, let's be fair.
He didn't
give me a chance.
After all,
I love you, too.
Linda, from the very
first moment we danced together,
I knew you were to be
the one girl in my life.
You didn't even
know my name.
Please. All right,
forget about me, then.
Forget about Jim,
think of yourself.
Here's your chance to do
the one thing you like best.
Not only for
Sorry, but I promised.
Well?
I guess I should apologize
for hooking up your number, huh?
Oh, forget it.
I'm the one that should apologize to you.
Here I've been trying
to take Linda away from you
not knowing you two
were going to be married.
Married?
Yeah, aren't you?
Yes, sure.
I mean, naturally,
we're sort of engaged.
Oh.
Well, anyway, I've decided
to bow out of here. Linda's all yours.
Well, you're
a pretty game guy to take it this way.
Well, it's happened so often
I'm getting used to it, that's all.
Good-bye, kid.
A lot of luck, Ted.
Thanks.
How are we doing?
Two minutes ago, I would
have sold my chances for a tired dime.
But when a man is
surprised to hear that he's going to be married,
brother, that's when
I go to work with a clear conscience.
Everything's good, huh?
Everything is perfect.
In your Easter bonnet
With all the frills
upon it
You'll be
the grandest lady
In the Easter parade
I'll be all in clover
And when
they look you over
I'll be
the proudest fellow
In the Easter parade
On the Avenue
Fifth Avenue
The photographers
will snap us
And you'll find
that you're
In the rotogravure
Oh, I could
write a sonnet
About your Easter bonnet
And of the girl
I'm taking
To the Easter parade
On the Avenue
Fifth Avenue
The photographers
will snap us
And you'll find
that you're
In the rotogravure
Oh, I could
write a sonnet
About your Easter bonnet
And of the girl
I'm taking
To the Easter parade
Hello!
I didn't exactly
expect the welcome mat,
but I thought somebody
might say hello.
Hello.
Thanks.
What brings you here
on this bright and uninviting day?
I've discovered something,
my friends, about life.
Meaning what?
Well, I don't want success,
I want the true happiness
you people have found here at the inn.
You're not gonna
stay in the inn?
Not just stay,
I want to be part of your shows,
help you in your work,
share your
simple pleasures.
I asked you once
not to interfere, Ted.
Please believe me,
I am a tired, lonely and unhappy man.
But I could be happy here,
helping the two people I like the best.
Will you take me in?
My motherly intuition
tells me to
throw him out.
Well, at least give him
the benefit of the doubt.
I've given him
plenty of doubt.
Are you kidding
with that "sharing life's simple pleasures"?
May I go inside
with you?
Why, of course.
My... My trunks will
arrive this afternoon.
What do I do?
Move in the broom closet?
Jim, that's no way
to talk to a man who's here to help you.
The world
doesn't change.
A gentle smile
often breeds a kick in the pants.
But for your sake,
Linda, I'll be big.
I'll give you a tip
about these things, Gus.
They'll go up and back,
but not sideways.
Yeah, well,
I keep forgetting
this blind thing can't
see where it's going.
Yeah, well, unload
the rest of this stuff in the back, huh?
TED: Hey! What did you do,
get up before breakfast?
Why, every morning.
I trust you slept well.
When I found out
how late you got in,
I told Mamie to
let you sleep.
Life on a farm!
Can't beat it, huh?
Jim, you've made me
very happy!
That's fine.
Now, how about
you making me happy?
You sound like a landlord
with eviction papers.
Oh. This is good news,
Lila's back in New York.
I got a letter
from her yesterday.
What happened to
her millionaire?
Slight mistake there.
He didn't own millions,
he owed them.
Poor girl, always straying
to greener pastures and finding spinach.
Say, she was
wondering if you'd
be interested in
taking her back as a partner.
I think it'd be
a great idea.
Naturally, you would.
But I like it here
with you and Linda.
Yes, and we love
having you, too.
Uh, when are
you leaving?
Why didn't you
say something? You look so silly.
Where's Jim?
Inside.
Good. I've fixed it.
Here's the news
in one luscious word:
Hollywood!
Now, I told you,
I'm not leaving here until Linda goes with me.
But this is the setup
you needed to get her away from Jim.
Now, there are going
to be two Hollywood men here tonight
to see the show.
One's an important
director.
If they like your dancing,
you and Linda
will be on a westbound
train tomorrow.
We better find out
if Linda's interested. Ooh.
We let her know
when there's a contract staring her in the face.
Look...
Now I know you're in love with the girl
but forget her until
we get her away from here.
This is no time
to be honest.
TED: Well,
what should I do?
All we have to do
is to convince Jim
that he'd be a heel
if he stood in the way of a chance like this.
Oh, that'll be easy,
like peeling a turtle.
Mamie says
these go up here!
Yes, set them right down.
Say, Gus, how would
you like to earn a slow $10?
Well, I don't care
how slow, but sure.
It's sure, all right, here's the wrinkle,
I want you to go
down to the station
pick up a party and
start for Holiday Inn
but never get here.
Could you handle that?
Wouldn't be surprised!
Hello, long distance.
That's what I want you
to do with Linda Mason.
Miss Mason?
Our friend?
You're not supposed
to understand it, Gus.
For that kind of money
you ought to be able to go by way of Medicine Hat.
Hello, yeah.
Just a minute.
Long distance,
I want to get Parkway Hotel,
New York City,
Miss Lila Dixon.
Didn't Linda say
she'd be here for final rehearsal?
Oh, relax,
our audiences aren't professional critics.
Gus, you made
a wrong turn.
Shortcut.
Gus!
Shortcut,
another shortcut.
How could you possibly
expect to drive through this?
Well, I never
had no trouble with a horse.
Oh, you'd better
carry me to shore,
and I'll walk
back to the highway.
Well, I think
you'd be better off waiting right here.
Gus, will you please
do as I say?
Oh, all right.
The other way.
Huh?
Turn around.
Gus, turn around!
Oh!
Gus!
My hat!
You pushed me.
Get my hat!
I swear the show will
start any minute now.
You said that
an hour ago.
Yeah, but this time
I'm sincere. Excuse me.
Who started the show?
I did. You're on.
But what about
Ted's partner?
You've kept this crowd
waiting long enough, he can go on without her.
Have you gone nuts?
I've rehearsed a double dance.
Let's say it with firecrackers and banners held high
Let's have
a real old-fashioned noisy Fourth of July
Let's say it
with firecrackers
They'll jump at up North
Let's have the kind
we used to call a glorious Fourth
Let's salute
our native land
Roman candles
in each hand
While a Yankee Doodle band
Gets hotter
than a firecracker
Don't need
any long speeches
Or shouts of "Hooray!"
No words can say as much
as firecrackers can say
Freedom! Freedom!
Here comes the Freedom Man
On this day
of independence
On this Independence Day
Listen to
an American troubadour from the U.S.A.
I'm singing a song
of freedom
For all people who
cry out to be free
Free to sail
the seven seas
Free to worship
as we please
If the birds
up in the trees
Can be free
Why can't we?
I'm bringing a song
of freedom
To all people
wherever they may be
Free to speak
and free to hear
Free from want
and free from fear
Sons of freedom
far and near
Who agree
Sing with me
That all God's people
shall be free
CHORUS: I'm singing a song
of freedom
For all people who
cry out to be free
JIM: Free to sail
the seven seas
Free to worship
as we please
If the birds
up in the trees
Can be free
Why can't we?
CHORUS: I'm bringing a song
of freedom
To all people
wherever they may be
JIM: Free to speak
and free to hear
Free from want
and free from fear
Sons of freedom
far and near
Who agree
Sing with me
That all God's people
shall be free
CHORUS: That all God's people
shall be free
Will you give me a lift?
Sure, hop in.
Aren't you Ted Hanover's
former dancing partner?
Yes, although
I wouldn't exactly say former.
I'm dancing with him
at the inn tonight.
But I... Doesn't he
have a new partner?
Oh, she won't be
there tonight.
I didn't know that!
I work at the inn.
Oh?
Waitress?
Yes.
I know your boss,
Jim Hardy, quite well. Quite well.
Then he's responsible for
your rejoining Mr. Hanover.
Uh-huh.
By the way, if I were you,
I'd look my prettiest tonight
when I'm waiting on tables.
Jim says there will
be a couple of men from Hollywood
to consider Ted and me
for pictures.
And Mr. Hanover's
other partner
will be missing this chance
to go to Hollywood.
Yes, although she can't
be very talented
or they wouldn't be
working at the inn.
Ted and I played
only the best places.
Listen, you're late
for the show already,
if you'd care
to let me drive
I know a shortcut
that'll get us there 15 minutes sooner.
There's a farmhouse
near here
and I'll have us towed out
in a couple of minutes.
Oh, for the love
of mud, hurry!
Wait right here!
What else can I do?
You're on now.
But Linda isn't here yet.
You've got to
save the pieces,
keep those men
interested now
and do a number
with Linda later.
What can I do?
Well, fake something.
Fake something, okay.
There's your cue.
Don't fail me,
keep them flying.
I'll keep them flying.
Linda!
What happened to you?
A bad job of sabotage.
Excuse me!
Well, Jim,
you deliberately kept me
from working at
the inn tonight, didn't you?
Yeah.
You knew there would be men here
from Hollywood
who might offer me a chance in pictures.
You've decided
I shouldn't have that opportunity.
Not even
the opportunity to refuse.
I was afraid
the offer might
be too important
for you to turn down.
The point is
you don't trust me to make my own decisions
because they might
interfere with your own selfish plans.
I've had about
enough of that, Jim.
Ted, Linda!
Mr. Parker,
Mr. Dunbar,
I want you to meet
the greatest dance team
in show business,
Hanover and Mason.
And the owner
Jim Hardy.
Glad to know you, Hardy.
Nice little place you've got here.
Gentlemen, even though
you haven't seen
Miss Mason dance,
I can assure you...
Hardy, Hollywood
is always interested
in new ideas
and we think this is a honey.
Frankly, we'd like to
do a picture based on the Holiday Inn.
The idea behind it,
how it works, the special holiday songs.
Of course, it's purely
a speculative thing, far from foolproof
and we can't afford
to pay too much.
You don't have to
start talking it down
because the idea
is not for sale.
Well, maybe I haven't
explained enough.
We expect to use Mr. Hanover
and his partner in the picture.
Well, I don't know
how the others feel
but I'd like to
keep this little setup just the way it is.
Jim, would you be
decent just once
and let somebody else
around here have a chance?
Wait a minute, Danny,
after all, the place belongs to him
he can do as he wants.
I guess it was just
too good to last, huh?
A simple little layout,
where we could do our best
at the work we know
without having any illusions of glory.
I can see now that
I'm the only one who could be happy here.
Go ahead,
take the idea, take the music,
take Linda,
take the whole darn thing.
But what about you?
We'll need you
in Hollywood to write
the rest of the music.
Oh, no,
I work right here.
I'll send you the music
when it's written.
And don't bother
me before, huh?
Guess maybe I was
a little selfish, huh?
Is that the deal you wanted
or should I have thrown in my shirt?
Chummy sort of a fellow,
isn't he?
Listen, Linda,
if you really want to stay here...
Don't talk that way.
This is the chance you wanted, isn't it?
Of course.
Boy, are we happy!
Happy Thanksgiving,
Mr. Jim.
Same to you, Mamie.
And staff.
Didn't I tell you children
to stay in the kitchen?
Those wings ain't
going to fly away. Now shoo!
Everything's
ready and hot, Mr. Jim.
Thank you, Mamie.
I've got plenty
to be thankful for
Are you kidding?
I haven't got
a great big yacht
To sail from
shore to shore
Still I've got plenty
to be thankful for
You're loaded, Dan.
I've got plenty
to be thankful for
Like what?
No private car
No caviar
No carpet on my floor
Still I've got plenty
to be thankful for
You know you're
better off than I am.
I've got eyes
to see with
You need glasses.
Ears to hear with
Or fly with.
Arms to hug with
Lips to kiss with
Someone to adore
You're a little flat, too.
How could
anybody ask for more?
My needs are small
I buy them all
At the five and ten cent store
Sing it!
Sing it pretty.
Oh, I've got plenty
to be thankful for
Why, you ain't
ate a bite.
I'm pouting, Mamie.
Who is this?
That's Mr. Jones.
Jonesey! I'm sorry,
I knew him too well.
But you got to eat.
The trouble ain't
with that turkey, Mr. Jim, it's you!
I feel all right.
I'm riding high, Mamie.
Well, why you close
the inn and sit around
like a jellyfish
with the misery?
'Cause a slicker
stole your gal
and you ain't got
fight enough to get her back.
Excuse me, Mr. Jim.
I tried to
keep her here!
What kind of keeping
is that?
Nothing but tricks.
If you went to Hollywood
and told Miss Linda
how much you loves her,
and misses her,
and told her that
the way a lady
likes to hear it told,
I'll bet you she'd be
the quickest ex-movie star that ever exed.
You're crazy, Mamie
I'm crazy?
I knows Miss Linda.
I knows her like
I knows my own kids.
Why, she ain't
the fancy type no more than you are.
What she wants is
what you got right here.
But women has to
have them things told to them the right way.
You could melt her heart
right down to butter,
if you'd only
turn on the heat.
Mamie, you don't try
to take a fellow's gal
away from him after
he's bought the ring.
Or as I recall, do you?
Now you're talking!
Oh, sure, women has to be
told things the right way.
MAMIE: Yes, sir!
At last, the night
I've been dreaming about actually here.
This is still
my wedding, you know.
You make me feel
like a kibitzer.
Now don't misunderstand me,
I'm happy because this marriage means
that we can all
settle down and stop worrying.
I wish
I had your confidence without your viewpoint.
My fingers are crossed
until Linda and I
are on that plane
bound for Yuma.
Now what's worrying you?
I don't know, except
I've been this close to marriage before
only to wake up
next morning
and find myself with
no bride and a hangover.
Look, the girl said yes,
the picture finishes tonight,
there's a judge
waiting in Yuma.
Come in!
Everything is
all set and ready.
What could
possibly happen to...
Hi, fellows!
Jim, what brought
you here?
Train.
Chug chug chug chug.
The wedding,
when is it?
Wedding?
Yeah.
Well, we hadn't
set any exact time.
Have you seen Linda?
No, no, not yet.
But, say, I saw your director,
he told me
he was shooting the finale tonight,
thought I'd like to see
how you make pictures.
He wouldn't...
You wouldn't like what they're doing tonight.
Why not?
Oh, no, that's dull,
technical stuff.
Well, I'm a dull,
technical sort of a fellow.
Perhaps if you'd wait
and see Linda tomorrow.
Oh, no, I want to
see the finish.
The success of you
and Linda means a lot to me, pal.
Say, why don't
you be yourself. What are you up to?
Well, I'm a son of a gun.
This is a beautiful hunk of welcome
for a guy who
comes coast to coast
just to wish you
a merry Christmas and a happy wedding.
You remember how
I suspected you
when you came to
live at the inn on Easter morning?
Silly, wasn't it?
Now I know he's
up to something.
Oh, wait a minute now
let's not be unfair.
No?
No, we're treating Jim
like a poor country cousin.
He doesn't mean
any harm! No!
No, he just wants
to see Linda.
So let's show him Linda.
Goodwill on earth
toward men.
This... Where we going?
What's this?
Hey, Ted! What is this?
TED: I was afraid
you'd gone crazy.
DANNY: I'll keep him in here
till you get Linda on that plane.
TED: I better hurry
and get my clothes on.
DANNY: Yeah,
in the meantime I'll go down to the set
and see how near
ready they are.
TED: Wait a minute,
my clothes are in there.
Merry Christmas!
Jim, pal! Wait!
Stop!
We were only fooling!
Only you could think
of a thing like that.
Who you calling?
Nobody,
the operator's gone.
Take it easy.
Don't break your neck.
It's one of the most
authentic reproduction jobs we've ever done.
Is it?
And all worked out
from those photographs
we took of your place
in Connecticut.
Uh-huh.
Well, Mamie and the kids
ought to see this. They'd never believe it!
Anything wrong?
Well, that Christmas tree's
a little out of place.
I'd guess nobody
would notice that but me or Linda.
We're going to
start rolling in a couple of minutes.
Come along with me
where you can see everything.
No, I'll just sort of
stay in the background.
I don't want to
get in your way.
Well, suit yourself.
I'll see you later.
Right.
All right, darling,
we're going to follow you
on the boom from
here inside the inn.
And when you get
in the other set, do your song.
Let's see, I think
you have the mood,
your Hollywood
success was empty,
you've lost
the one man you love. You know, the usual hope.
Just make me cry
and you can get to that wedding.
All ready for rehearsal!
Please! Let's shoot it.
Okay, it's a take!
All right, everybody,
quiet on the stage, it's a take.
Close them up. Come on, over there,
quiet down,
let's get settled, everybody.
Come on, everybody,
let's get settled now. This is the picture.
Hit the snow!
All right, roll 'em!
Sorry, Mr. Hanover,
but when the red light's on
you couldn't get in
even if you owned the studio.
Oh, but, pop,
this is important.
I know,
so is the light.
Hit the playback.
Music!
All right, action!
I'm dreaming
of a white Christmas
Just like the ones
I used to know
Where the treetops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells
in the snow
...dreaming of a white
Christmas
With every
Christmas card I write
May your days be
merry and bright
Jim!
Cut it! Cut it!
That's it!
All right, gentlemen!
How could
he get that far in five minutes?
The lady must
have been willing.
But the world
can't do this to us.
Here she comes down the street
I'll admit my defeat
I've won my hot toddy
Over my scarred body
I knew that
I'd win singing
But wait until
she gets a load of your dancing
We'll stay at
the inn singing
All by myself
I'll have to stick to my dancing
Oh, no, my friend,
I'm here to end
Your dancing
trouble and strife
This will be fun,
Miss Hit-and-Run
Has come back
into my life
We'll stay at the inn...
We'll have to begin...
Singing!
Dancing!
We've each other
to cling to
You'll be easy
to sing to
And you're easy
to dance with
So let the old year die
with a fond good-bye
And our hopes
as high as a kite
How can our love
go wrong
If we start
the new year right?
