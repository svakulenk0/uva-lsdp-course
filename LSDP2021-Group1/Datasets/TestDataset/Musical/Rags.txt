New York city..
Not a land far far away..
But still one of the most magical cities in the world.
Its streets buzzing with people and..
Buildings that seem to go on forever.
It's a kind of place where fairytales
seem to be possible..
No matter who you are.
This isn't one of your typical
Cinderella story..
There are no pumpkin,
no mice..
No Cinderella.
Or at least not the one
you're used to.
Meet Charlie.
He was young when he lost his mom.
Leaving him with Art,
his step father.
And then there's these two.
Charlie's stepbrothers.
Who are just a litte..
How do i say this..
Annoying.
Now Charlie stucks cleaning the place
his mom once owned.
Wait, wait.
Before we lay our fairytale play out,
you should know..
Charlie has a talent.
A real gift from music.
Yo, come out!
And this is where i come in.
Like i said..
This is a fairytale
with a twist.
I'm no fairy godmother.
But Charlie has a dream.
And all he needs is someone
to hear him.
And open a door.
It's just water.
Come on, people!
Keep it up, man.
Next time i see you,
you better be in an album cover.
Thank you.
Who knows?
Maybe one day, you'll be as famous as she is.
And that's the beauty of this city.
You never know
what's gonna happen next.
Just around the corner, there could be
something amazing.
Or someone.
What?
What's up?
Cut, cut!
What's wrong with playback?
Working on it, boss.
I don't know, this computer had
a panic attack or something.
Unreal.
Just give me a minute.
-Everyone take 10.
Trumpet!
Get that dog off of my couture!
Why can't you have a
purse-sized dog..
Like all of the other stars?
This horse dog doesn't fit your image.
Trumpet doesn't care about my image.
He loves the real me,
and i love him.
Isn't that right, boy?
Isn't that right..
Should i rub your belly?
Should i rub our miss' belly?
No one touches my belly.
Hey!
Grilled cheese with pickles,
on rye.
You are the best, Martha.
If it weren't for Diego,
i would propose to you right now.
That'd be great, maybe she'll stop bugging me for a bigger ring.
Hah! This guy..
He brings me stuff he finds in the streets,
everyday.
Why don't you find me a ring in the street?
And maybe some customers.
-Customers..
That's what we need.
If your mom only knew Arthur turns
this place into a ghost town.
I should do something about it.
Diego's not gonna have to do anything.
Cause things are not gonna be like this
for much longer.
Really? Alright, Charlie..
You got a little plan brewing?
Nope, i got nothing.
I can barely move in this outift.
You look amazing.
Thanks, girl.
It's the latest design by GG le Tron.
What about GG le Normal?
GG le Clothing Wearable by Human?
Can't we put any outfits from
anyone like that?
There's my girl.
Daddy!
-Kadee, MTV!
I didn't think you'd make it.
-No hugging, it'll wrinkle!
I think she'd survive a wrinkle or two.
Come here.
That's what i'm going to say. Go for it.
You only live once.
The biggest star of Majesty Records,
and i remember when she was singing in diapers.
How's the shoot?
You're killing it?
The only thing getting killed
are my feet.
It's going fine.
Can i talk to you, please?
-Yeah.
Hey guys, why don't you get a shot of that set,
that i'm paying so much money for?
What's up?
-Daddy..
Don't you think these all
is a little..
Much?
Like maybe i should be singing my own stuff.
I don't know if that's the best idea..
Best idea, jinx!
Sweety..
I just want you to be protected.
That's why i get you the best songwriter
money can buy.
Don't worry.
Your new single is gonna be a hit.
Trust me.
I got to take this, ok?
We're announcing the talent search today.
Kadee, your dog is chewing
on the microphone.
Trumpet, that microphone is not
a dog bone!
These are different from the ones i like.
Look, it's MTV.
Kadee, after 6 number 1s..
Kadee!
Hate these clothes so much..
Why can't they all see?
The more i go through,
i don't want to..
Just want to be me.
Who do you think you are?
I don't pay you to waste your time.
Actually, you don't pay me at all.
Are you sassing me, Charlie?
No sir.
Good.
My mom used to let me sing whatever i..
-Your mom..
Not only left me in charge of you, but..
Also of this dump which i also have to run.
It's time to open.
Let's go.
Are you guys open yet?
Not quite, but..
We have a special treat for you,
Charlie!
Why don't you introduce the opening act?
Ladies and gentlemen..
Please give it up
for Andrew and Lloyd.
That's Androyd!
When you combine Andrew and Lloyd..
Androyd.
I hate you so much, Lloyd.
Ouch, harsh much?
Yeah!
My boys!
We're submitting a CD for the Majesty Records' talent seach..
The search is over, am i right
or am i right?
I'm hit!
Andrew!
Do you take requests?
Hi!
-Hello!
Kadee, hi!
How are you?
-Let's go, it's the fans.
Lovelies.. You got pens and stuff,
this is great.
Thank you.
-Oh, you want a hug?
Thank you, you're beautiful.
How are you?
Can we just get through this?
Remember, we agree to keep
this one short.
But they love us,
look at it!
No?
Alright, fine.
Let's go.
You look fantastic, you both look amazing.
-Thanks.
Let's do a couple of photoes.
-Finn, Kadee, over here!
How about a kiss?
-Alright.
You better show this one, boys!
Oh yeah, that's good.
Could you move over a bit?
I just want the light to hit my cheekbones.
Cheers, thanks love.
It's actually clean.
So am i free to go?
-Yes.
Free to go drop off Androyd's
demo CD..
Into Majesty Records for the talent search.
Androyd has a CD?
Are you jealous, Charlie?
You should be.
But don't worry,
when they're number 1..
You can clean the dressing room.
That's a relief, for a second there i thought
you were gonna say something really mean.
Don't forget, curfew is midnight!
Can't wait!
Kadee, look over here.
-Thank you.
You are great.
I think i'm gonna walk today, Tony.
Get some fresh air.
-You're father won't like this.
He also wouldn't like you're using his Nicks tickets without him knowing.
Enjoy the park.
-See you.
Come on, Trumpet.
-You take care of her.
Trumpet!
I love you too.
Come on!
Sorry, here sorry..
-Sorry.
Sorry.
Oh no.
Trumpet!
Hey, do you mind?
That's private.

Do you have experience?
Experience?
Cleaning?

Majesty Records.
I thought i was supposed to see you
on an album cover, what happened?
You saw me play in the streets the other day.
-Yeah.
Do you work here?
-Yup, studio engineer.
And you want to work here as..
A janitor?
Ever since i was a little boy,
i've just wanted to scrub toilets.
I can see how that beats
playing music.
Do you ever play?
-Yeah, i played the streets..
Barmitzvah,
Botmitzvah..
Any mitzvah you can book, really.
That's all behind me now.
Shawn.
Charlie.
Don't work too hard.
I always work too hard.
Do me a favor, would you?
Make sure he gets hired.
Will you go on a date with me?
-No.
I'll still do it.
Stupid boy, right Trumpet?
Not a total loss.
It's her.
It's her!
It is!
Kadee Worth!
Mom, it's Kadee Worth!
It's Kadee Worth!
Thanks a lot, trumpet.
I love you!
Can i get a picture with you?
-Sure.
Mom, take my picture.
Thank you!
What are you doing?
No touching the merchandise.
Are you here to make another payment?
Yeah.
$9,57?
At this rate, your mom's piano will be yours..
In 2021..
Bye , Bern!
-See you later, Charlie!
So many thank yous..
My agents,
my managers..
And of course none of this would be possible
without my trusty rag..
Dad, you..
Hey!
What are you doing here?
I didn't mean to startle you,
i work here.
That could be fake.
People get fake IDs.
If i were gonna get a fake ID,
would i use this picture?
Yeah, he's checked out.
What do you have behind your back, Charlie?
Nothing.
You're not a good liar.
I am too a good liar.
I am a very good liar, i've lied successfuly
on many occasions.
In fact just yesterday.
I'm not a very good liar.
I lied.
See? You are a liar.
Kadee, my darling, my love.
It's me your prince, you're late for the..
Who's this guy?
Charlie.
Okay.
Are you signed to the Majesty Records as well?
I'm the janitor.
That's a bit of a lame stage name, mate.
I'll go with something else.
I don't know, the Janitor?
It might work.
What, are you like a rapper or something?
No, i'm just the actual janitor.
Oh, well..
That's great.
Okay.. Bye.
It's time for Kadee Worth's fragrance
launch party.
I told them to wait,
let's go.
Kadee..
Great..
A wonderful evening with my boyfriend.
He's Finn.
Most girls would kill
to be set up with him.
I know, i know.
-You should be "happy".
"And i am".
Why are you guys keep doing
that thing with your fingers?
I've told you, it confuses me.
And it frightens me.
It makes me want to punch you both.
How's this for my "i'm so happy..
"I'm in a relationship that my dad thinks would sell records" face.
It's good.
-Great.
Come on, trumpet.
If you're gonna be late, call.
You know how it works.
He's probably the youngest janitor ever,
am i right?
Uh.. Would you..
That's funny.
I could do that too.
We're playing..
Inappropriate.
How adorable are we, right?
Just adorable.
Scrub that, uh..
I hope you have a good night, sir.
How about that weather we're having?
Very nice..
What do you think, Trumpet?
Someday.
Hey Kadee.
-Hey!
How's your dog?
-He's good, he misses you.
I miss him too.
I think i'm falling for you dog.
Somebody will..
Somebody will clean that up.
-Somebody like the janitor?
That's me.
I should probably get started on that.
Sweet.
Testing, 1..2..3.
Ready to record his new single..
Grammy winner Charlie Prince,
With his new hit
"Hands up".
What..
Thank you.
Thank you..
Shawn, i'm so sorry.
I was just messing around.
Messing around?
How'd you like to try that for real?
-For real?
You gotta be kidding,
i'm just the kid with rags and mops.
Dude, you are way more than just a kid with rags.
What i heard in there was a bonafide
recording artist.
And a real recording artist needs a demo,
i can help you make that happen.
You mean here, at the studio?
Don't say anything, just sing.
Alright, you're ready to go?
Here it comes.
Hey, can we do another?
I got tons of more songs.
Boys, this is your ticket..
To the big time.
What does it say?
Thank you for sending your demo material
to Majesty Records..
For consideration, presently your demo package is one of a quantity of exemplary material that was submitted to our office.
We regret to inform you,
you did not qualify..
At the Majesty Records talent contest..
This is your fault.
You're my brother.
I love you.
-I love you too.
And why are we following this kid?
I don't know.
There's just something about him.
OMG..
He's so dreamy..
Just keep the engine running.
Charlie..
What did you do, kid?
Sell a body part?
I got a job.
If you keep doing payments like this,
and that piano's yours 5 years top.
So, what can i play for you today, my man?
Play "Perfect Harmony" again.
For $100..
It's Perfect Harmony,
going out to my man Bernie.
Not bad for a janitor.
Thanks, i.. i was just messing around.
Why are you here anyway?
Did you follow me here?
I didn't follow, i was just..
Looking for some creepy stuff
for my room.
Uh uh..
What are you doing here?
You come to some pawn shop to play
a ratty old piano, what's that about?
It's my mom's.
And more gorgeous, it cannot be.
Thanks.
I should say it was my mom's.
Once upon a time.
So, your mom's gone?
My stepdad used the piano money
to buy karaoke machine.
Sorry, Charlie.
Why don't you let a professional handle this?
My mom died too.
I'm sorry, i didn't know.
How could you? I don't wear the
"My mom died" T-Shirt much these days.
You have one too?
It's good to talk to somebody who understand.
That was fun.
What were you playing before?
That was just a little bit of a song i wrote.
So those were your songs i got wet
the other day?
Don't worry, they stayed all in one piece.
Can I?
These lyrics are great.
Why haven't i heard you sing
songs like thesE?
Right, my dad would go nuts.
They don't exactly fit the
Kadee Worth Brand.
But maybe someday i will.
No, you need to do it today.
I want to take you some place.
Do you trust me?
Ever since i was a little girl..
My dad always told me..
Kadee, trust the janitor.
I trust you.
Miss Worth..
For my kid.
Make it out to Bernie.
For my kid.
Named Bernie.
Princess, subway is one block away.
Kadee, your dad's not gonna like it.
He's also not gonna like you're using his Yankee tickets without him knowing.
You two enjoy yourselves.
You're gonna need this.
So..
-This is the spot.
Here?
It's perfect.
And no one will know it's you.
That makes me feel a lot better.
Ladies and gentlemen, i would like to..
Charlie, no.
-What?
I can't do it.
you're good to go.
Okay.
Break it up.
Move on, or i'll give you a ticket.
Ow..
Here you go.
You gotta keep this.
First dollar you make from your own music.
No no, you put that back in there.
Thanks, Charlie.
You're good.
You should do this for a living..
Thanks.
Good.
No no.. Wait wait!
Come back, hold the bus!
Come on, i got it!
-Wait!
Come on!
Hey, one second.
Thank you.
I can't believe i just did that.
-You were awesome.
I haven't felt like that performing
in so long.
Thank you, Charlie.
-My pleasure.
Let me pay you back somehow.
No no..
-Here.
I want you to come to this party
my dad's throwing.
Really?
-It's gonna be amazing.
Except i'll be working and have to miss out
on all the fun.
Wait!
Are you Kadee Worth?
Can i have your autograph?
-Sure.
It's Kadee Worth.
This is Kadee Worth!
You're late.
Nope, 58 seconds to spare, so..
If you'll excuse me.
What's this?
Invitation to..
Majesty Records' masquarade ball?
That's when they announce the winner
to the talent search.
Charlie, did you steal this?
No, i didn't steal it.
Kadee Worth gave them to me.
Right.. Kadee Worth gave it to you.
Kadee Worth, that's so cool.
It is.
Just give it back.
Charlie, i'm sorry..
I can't let this go to waste.
Excuse me?
Boys, your stepbrother has given you
the opportunity of a life time.
You're gonna go to that party and
you're gonna show Reginald Worth..
That he made a big mistake
rejecting your CD.
That is my invitation!
Charlie..
This is your opportunity too,
you..
You can stay behind and you can..
You can run the karaoke machine.
Consider it a promotion.
Boys, get to bed.
We gotta get up early and rent ourselves
some costumes.
Masquerade.. We're going..
Popularity is growing.
Our lyrics are flowing..
-the ladies..
-There's gonna be ladies?
There's gonna be ladies..
I can't do this anymore.
Are there gonna be ladies?
Diego, get my sewing machine.
You mean that sewing machine i found on the street
that you didn't want?
Yes, finally one of your pieces of junk
is gonna be of some use.
I'll get it in a second, can you believe someone
threw away this perfectly good bike?
Stop messing with the garbage, we gotta get
Charlie into that party.
What party?
Hey, done with your chores?
You're smiling.
Nobody smile about chores.
Ta da!
For you.
To work the karaoke machine?
For the Majesty Records' party.
Arthur gave my invitation to Androyd.
Come on, you're gonna let a detail
like an invitation to stop you?
No, i'm gonna let about a billion other things stop me.
Arthur will destroy me if he found out i went,
i have school tomorrow, there's tons of security..
Maybe even an X-Ray.
For you.
Your welcome.
-Thank you.
It's awesome, but..
Who's gonna MC karaoke
if i'm not here?
I'm your man.
Seriously?
-Yeah.
I've always wanted to do this job
and i know i can do a great job too.
What if i see Arthur at the party?
We thought of that.
You may see Arthur..
But Arthur will never see you.
Game changer.
Hey!
Boys! let's go!
Have a nice pity party.
You're having a party?
I was making fun of him, you idiot.
I gotta..
I'll bring you some cake.
I still don't know how i'm
gonna make it home before Arthur.
That'll be easy.
You're gonna take the fastest transportation
there is in this city.
Tada!
My trusted steed, is now yours.
Perfect!
Do you have the mask?
-Yeah.
Do you think he'll get in?
Not a chance.
Kadee, you're performing your number 1 single tonight
"Love you, Hate you". Looking forward to it?
Yes, i'm very excited, it's always great to perform
in front of a crowd.
Whether it's Madison Square Garden
or here.
Would you say, this is your most personal album to date?
When you say personal..
-Of course it is.
Of course it is, right?
Except for the part in the song
when she said she hates me.
Cause she doesn't, right?
Do you?
It's like when i was recording my album..
You never want to speak the truth..
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome Nick Cannon.
Thank you.
Welcome Majesty Records' guests.
Are you all ready to get down?
Let's do this.
Lloyd, shape up!
You'll never get discovered
makin a mess of yourself.
I'm more likely to get discovered..
What?
Think about it, you're walking to a party,
there's 2 guys standing.
One of them has barbeque sauce,
covering his face.
Me, i look at the sauce guy.
Andrew, would you like to go mingle
while your brother cleans himself up?
Absolutely.
Hey.
Hi, i'm Llyod.
-I'm tammy.
No.. No..
No!
Invitation?
That guy stole my ticket.
And i was like 'Use it, no way that doorman's gonna believe that's your ticket'.
And then he was like
"doormen are stupid."
What?
And i was like "doormen is a respectable profession
with a very rich history".
Wait here.
That worked.
Sorry.
Excuse me, i didn't see you.
No, it's my bad.
I didn't see you there, big guy.
Keep up the good work.
Bye.
Do i know you?
-No.
ALright, make some noise!
Come on, come on.
I got babies at home that make more noise than that.
Make some noise!
Yeah, that's what i'm talking about.
We got Kadee Worth in the building,
Ya'll make some noise!
What up, Nick!
-What's up, girl!
You all are looking beautiful,
let's go ahead and show in the Majesty Records, we know how to have a good time.
Are you ready to dance with your king?
No, i'm ready to dance with you.
Hey! Looking good.
Thanks, you too.
Thank you for doing this for me.
-Anytime.
Impressed.
Yeah.
Let's mix it up, party people!
Ya'll looking a little too comfortable.
I want everybody on the dance floor,
turn to your left and meet your new partner.
I guess you're my partner.
-I guess i am.
So, having fun tonight?
If i'm being honest..
Not really.
I guess now i am.
I don't know, i just have a hard time..
Relaxing and being yourself?
How do you know that?
I see.
Thanks for the dance,
you're pretty amazing.
No, it's true. You're too amazing
to be anything less than yourself.
Just be you.
Nice to meet you.
Alright, alright, it is time to announce the finalist
for the Majesty Records' talent search.
It should be Androyd.
And the winner is..
Fay Train!
Fay Train..
Ladies and gentlemen, i've just been informed
that the plane has been delayed.
And Fay Train will not be with us tonight.
What?
Why am i just hear, Irma!
I did not,
i was not aware.
I.. We could..
They're upset, somebody better give them
a runner up.
Sometimes opportunity knocks.
Sorry, off limits.
It's me, Charlie!
Hey man.
-Hey.
Check it out.
All done.
Rags?
Everyone needs a stage name.
I figured when you're huge, you need to remember
where you came from.
So all those millions of fans
don't go to your head.
This is the nicest thing
anyone ever done for me.
Don't get all emotional on me, now.
It's good by the way,
really good.
Hello, Majesty Records. I'm Andrew.
-I'm Lloyd, and we're Androyd.
No..
No..
Who are they?
Oh man, what are they doing?
You know these guys?
Unfortunately yes, those clows are sort of my stepbrothers.
I can't take this anymore.
This is your chance,
get up there.
What? On stage?
I can't do that.
If you're terrible,
nobody will know it's you.
Come on, you're gonna kill it.
-Okay.
What happened?
What did you do?
-Ladies and gentlemen, give it up for..
Rags!
Hey!
Stop it!
Charlie?
Let's get out of here.
No, i want to stay for the party.
These girls are totally checking me out.
They just want to interview you
for the Idiot Magazine.
really?
Plenty of people here she could talk,
if these people are audience!
Come on, we gotta go strategize.
Never give up!
-never surrender.
Losers!
Wait!
Who are you?
Be you..
Did i miss something?
You're gonna pay me or what?
Oh no!
I told you i'm married!
Martha, it's me.
-Charlie!
You scared me!
I'm locked out.
-After the other night, Arthur nailed the mensroom's window shut.
So, how was the party?
-Later..
Arthur, keep him distracted.
Diego!
Hurry, hurry!
-What about my tip?
No!
Hey Arthur, check it out.
Idiot! Straight to bed, you two!
I'm checking on Charlie.
What is this?
This place is a mess.
Arthur, hungry? Thristy?
I made you your favorite.
I'm sure the food at the party
was awful.
No! Thank you!
-I'm thirsty.
Diego! Hurry up!
Come on!
Go!
Arthur, wait wait..
I must ask you something.
-Now?
Yeah.
I need to know something.
Out with it, Diego!
What do you want for breakfast?
The ommelete you had the other day
was very tasty, right?
Yeah sure, it's fine.
Whatever!
Move!
-Move?
This way?
Move!
I didn't hear you knock.
That's because i didn't.
My CD.
No no no..
That's not good.
Dad, if you could just please..
-I don't have time.
Fay Train is thinking about signing with another label.
I have to meet with him.
But this is the Rags guy from the party last night.
Kadee, i am the guy that's always looking
for the next best thing.
But clearly Rags isn't ready for the big time,
or else he wouldn't ran out like he did.
Besides, i'm more concern about you.
Irma tells me you've been missing meetings.
Irma needs to mind her own business.
You're changing the subject.
Rags is amazing, and if you give him a chance
you can see he has a lot to offer..
Kadee, i don't want to talk about Rags anymore.
We're about to launch the biggest record of your carrer,
and you're getting distracted.
And you're not listening.
It's my job to make sure my daughter's head
is on straight.
Your job as my dad or
chairman of Majesty Records?
We'll talk about this when i get back.
No problem.
Hey you!
Hey, kadee.
What are you doing here?
Where were you last night?
Caught a cold, stayed home,
watched a movie.
Really?
What did you watch?
Can't remember the name.
Reese Whiterspoon was in it though..
Cried my eyes out.
-Right.
You're right when you said
you weren't a good liar.
Helps to practice, though.
Anyway, you totally missed out.
I know, i wanted to hear you sing.
-No, not me!
This Rags guy perform,
he killed it!
Really?
-Really!
This guy Rags killed it?
The dude can sing.
And he's not too bad at the kissing stuff either.
He kissed you?
Just laid one on me,
no time to react. Really..
There was nothing i could do.
-Right.
So why did you come here today?
I was hoping you'd be able to help me.
Rags left a CD.
No contact info,
no nothing.
But what he did have was a track of the song
he performed last night..
And this.
The song is great.
That song someday is gonna lead me
straight to Rags.
Wait, you want to find Rags? Why?
Charlie, you should have seen him,
he sang about something that was more than I love you, I hate you..
It was really inspiring.
Kadee, i should tell you..
I'm Rags.
He's amazing, Charlie seriously,
you gotta help me find this guy.
Sometimes it feels like the whole world
wants a piece of Kadee Worth..
But not you, Charlie.
Please help me find Rags.
And how do you plan on finding him?
That song, you and i are the only two
that have heard it.
We'll hold an audition.
Whoever sings Someday..
Is the real Rags..
So are you in, or out?
In.
Good job.
Can i recommend in D minor?
Oh..
My God!
You're her!
Would you..
Would you sign this for me?
Please?
We're up on Perez..
That's great.
Guess what? We're on MTV homepage too.
Nice!
Guilty Group is having a sample sale.
Majesty Records will sign the first person
who proved they're Rags.
We're scouring the internet,
we're holding auditions..
I know he's out there somewhere, and i won't stop until i find him.
Are you Rags?
Yes!
Hello?
Great, she's on her way.
Thank you.
The venue is available.
-Yes!
Let's go check it.
Let's go.
Thanks.
Who are you texting now?
-I'm not texting.
I'm tweeting about the Rags audition.
I just hit 7 million followers.
Seriously? 7 million followers?
Yeah, how many do you have?
My gosh, tons.
So many tweeters..
Also follow my..
My tweeting..
-Tweeting?
You're hilarious.
-You're hilarious.
You're hilarious.
-No, you're hilarious..
My bad, i thought that bench was longer.
You're lucky i like you.
No, i'm Rags!
This is what is happening.
There is a mob scene in the lobby.
Since you were too busy to listen to the CD,
i'm holding auditions to find Rags.
Yes, Irma has made me aware.
Kadee, this is a complete fiasco..
You are putting your music in jeopardy,
and your relationship with Finn.. He's a mess!
Look at him!
Relationship?
This guy Rags is kicking me off all
the magazine covers.
But more importantly, i miss you.
I miss us.
We don't talk anymore.
Because we never talked.
This is a business arrangement.
And none of you ever listened.
Because you're too busy running around
with that kid.
Who, Charlie?
-See?
It's cute you're trying to make me jealous.
She's trying to get my attention.
I've got it, you're here.
I'm here, hello.
Kadee, is this true?
You're totally right, what was i thinking?
Why would Kadee Worth, the biggest star in the world,
hang out with someone who scrubs the floor i walk on?
It's not like that. We just want you to focus
on your music.
Yes, your music.
And us. I think we should do an exclusive
with the Hollywood VIP.
Why can't you be more grateful?
Peopla are always telling me
how grateful i should be.
But how can i be grateful when i'm successful
at something that my heart just not in.
Charlie is cooler than everyone in this building combined.
And he's gonna help me find Rags.
We're gonna proof you guys wrong.
And Finn, here's an exclusive..
We're done.
Somone's got her crabby pants on today, right?
Finn, go make a record or something.
really?
No, no!
Llyod, how many times are you
gonna mess up the snake?
You're ruining the whole thing.
You go right and then left.
When your brother goes left and then right.
Take a break.
I'm exhausted.
Need any help?
Excuse me?
My dad was yelling at me again.
I could use some company.
You know, ever since that Rags guy showed up at the ball,
he's been worse than ever.
Was Rags really that good?
Oh yeah, you would have loved him.
Plus, you're both have the same way of
marking up your shoes.
Don't worry, your secret's safe with me.
-No way.
Plus i kinda like it how it makes my dad so angry.
Can i ask you something?
Why don't you just tell Kadee?
She's Kadee Worth,
she can have anybody.
Maybe she wants you.
Trust me, Lloyd, no girl's looking for a nobody from a horrible family.
They want some good looking famous guy
who will be mean to them.
Girls are weird like that.
What are you doing?
You never know, until you try.
Lloyd!
-I can keep picking up these glasses..
And dropping them on this floor,
until you're telling me you're going for this girl.
Not gonna happen.
What about the audition?
Obviously Rags won't be showing up,
but that's just how it's gonna have to be.
No no!
-What is going on?
Look at all these broken glasses.
No no no..
This is coming out of your pay.
-You don't pay me.
Are you ready to focus
and rehearse with your brother?
Yeah, just making sure this grunt muffin
doesn't break all our glasses.
That's my boy.
-I'll be right there.
I'm sorry, i didn't mean to do that.
You know you're not a grunt muffin, right?
I don't even know what a grunt muffin is.
Gross.
What is this stuff?
Come on!
What's the cheapest one you got?
What?
Something interesting has come up.
I'll call you back.
This better be good.
Nice.
Nice..
Excited?
-Nervous.
I don't know why,
i've been in front of huge crowds.
I guess this time it's just different.
Well, i have nothing but fate in you.
Just be you.
What?
Charlie?
-Kadee?
What are you doing here?
Auditioning.
What are you doing here?
You don't miss an opportunity, do you?
Dad is looking for you, he said it's important.
He's upstairs.
Okay.
You're pretty crafty, Charlie.
You know, sometimes i think i underestimated you.
Thanks, though most of the time i think
you just overestimate yourself.
Hey, i'm trying to be nice here.
I got something for you.
Come on, i'll show you.
-Okay.
My friend Charlie.. Right here.
Woo.. Hey!
So you think you're a singer, Charlie?
How dare you try to steal your brothers' dream.
By they way, i'm selling the Palace.
They're gonna turn it into an auto-part store,
maybe they need a janitor.
Now, if you'll excuse me, i have to introduce Andrew to the world as Rags.
No!
Where's Charlie?
I won't let you stop this.
Who says i'm here to stop this?
-Here to stop this?
You wanna help me find Rags?
I'm sorry i haven't been listening to you.
I need to do that more.
What happened to my dad?
Is your head on straight?
I think it finally is.
And i think that..
-That i'm in love with Irma.
I'm sorry.
Next.
I'm sorry..
Next.
It's done.
Andrew, consider tonight the first night
of the rest of your career.
What about my career?
What about Androyd?
It's a solo act now, bro.
You're just back up.
Tonight, i'm Rags.
What?
I'm not even surprised.
Help! Help!
Please help me!
Trumpet! It's me, go get help boy!
Go go go!
I'm bored.
Bored.
Let's get out of here.
People are singing.
Baby, you're ready to call it quits?
-Not quite yet, dad.
So, Rags seems to be on the shy side.
Maybe i'll sing a little and that'll show you how it's done.
You're Rags?
You heard the song, didn't you?
But you sounded so different
at the masquerade party.
Different lyrics,
and the acoustic here stinks.
Trumpet, what has gotten into you?
It's me, please get me out of here!
-Charlie?
You gotta get me out of here, please help!
-Okay!
Will this help?
-No.
I got this.
I totally help.
-Thank you.
Go go go..
Congratulations, i guess.
My daugther sees something in you.
And i'm the man of my word,
welcome to Majesty records.
Thank you.
The future of Majesty Records,
ladies and gentlemen.
Looks like you're a little late.
Sorry Charlie..
And now..
Welcome to the subway..
Hey party pooper.
You can't leave yet, we haven't introduced Rags, our guest of honor.
You didn't really think you'd win, did you?
Charlie, where are you going?
You can't leave.
Can't stay..
Sort of done with this place.
- Wait..
Can you do me a favor before you go?
Stay while I introduce Rags.
Couldn't found him without you.
Excuse me..
Excuse me..
And first of all thank you all for coming for this celebration.
It's been a pretty wild ride, hasn't it everybody?
- Yeah..
And what a crazy ending, who would've thought we'd actually find our Rags..
But we did.
I knew Rags was incredibly talented the minute i heard him sing.
I knew its lyrics would inspired others like they inspired me.
But what took time to realize,
was that his friendship that change me the most.
So, without further ado..
Please put your hands together for the real Rags..
The sign, i made him..
Mr. Charlie Prince.
- What?
- What?
What?
Charlie, it's time to be you.
Well, I'm sure we all enjoy and get laugh but I'm glad to be here and..
I'm sorry for the confusion everyone..
Charlie, get your butt up here.
- How did you know?
- Just be you?
How could you think I wouldn't figure it out?
It's your stage, Charlie.
Take it.
Wait..wait..
Look, I'm not the only artist here tonight though, folks.
As the real Rags, it is my pleasure to give you..
The real Kadee Worth.
Sing what you've sang to me.
- Sing your song.
- I can't.
My dad has a plan.
No sweetheart..
I wanted to hear your song.
And boy did i hear you, loud and clear.
Loud and clear, jinx.
And from now on, you're in charge in picking your own music.
And thanks to you all and you Shawn..
We found our real Rags.
You're our next big star.
Well at least we still got the Palace.
Actually, no you don't.
What?
What?
What are you talking about?
- You know exactly what i'm talking about.
- No Lloyd, don't.
No, okay?
NO! I..
I'm done lying for you.
Your mom didn't leave this place for our dad,
She left it for you, check the deed.
That is a lie.
You little traitor.
- I don't..
- This place is yours.
Charlie, you got your fairytale ending.
Come here..
What am i suppose to do now?
And it's not over yet.
So maybe life can be like a fairytale after all.
Do you have a dream?
Do you believe?
