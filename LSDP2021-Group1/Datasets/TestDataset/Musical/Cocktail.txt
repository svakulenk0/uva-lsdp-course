Ravi sir is with the clients.
He could not be reached by phone.
He will come only late.
She came to the new play station.
She offers a treat as she got
the silver star for quarterly exam.
A play station and a bucket chicken.
Ask Ravi to call me. Ok.
- Did you see my daughter?
- No!
She is standing there.
You are smart. I was afraid.
Looks cute, right?
Uncle gave me this.
Oh God!
Christ! You spoilt it.
I wanted to give a surprise!
The same surprise always!
Why don't you change
it for sometime?
I'm bored by acting as scared!
Why did you cry out?
It fell down as you
gave me a shock!
Are you bold enough?
You should have
taken my photo then!
The real face which scares off
the workers in this site!
Yet my black Forest is shattered.
I broke open the bakery
and brought here.
I remember when I sees it.
...as the title of the article
in the magazine!
The memory of the cake shattered.
It is my heart
which is broken and shattered.
See you! 2 minutes plan
of mine is there.
It was quite a big plan.
I've toiled much to get this
knife and match box in the dark!
Hold it.
Blow.
Not for me. Here.
Let us have it more tastier! Come.
- Ammu!
- What is going on here?
It is mom's birth day!
She was cutting the cake!
Why didn't you call me?
Dad thought that you were sleeping!
- Didn't you sleep?
- No!
- Then? - I was making
my doll to sleep!
Didn't your doll sleep?
How can it be
when you make noise?
We will give her sleeping pills!
What is your mom doing?
Ouch! She eats up the cake
which have fallen down.
Don't eat the cake
which have fallen down?
Mom is a dirty girl!
Keep the knife here.
Come. We shall go upstairs...
...and sing a birth day song for her!
You are below the shadee
e'ee meet down by the dreams.
Under the rain of your love
e'ee get drenched with memories.
With our eyes,
we attained the language of mind.
Time when you opened the blue window
e will tell the sweetness of the heart
et has filled my heart with love
You are below the shade
e'ee meet down by the dreams.
Under the rain of your lovee
e'ee get drenched with memories.
Did Abheri tune
the wind sings caress you?
The light clouds in the dusk applied...
...dot on the foreheade
The heart filled with happiness
...the time when the tune has playede
Who is the star searching?
Is it the eye of the star?
Yet we together will climb the steps
Above the sky blesses
us a virtuous lifee
You are below the shadee
e'ee meet down by the dreams.
Under the rain of your lovee
e'ee get drenched with memories.
M. D is quite angry!
What did I do for that?
He is asking the same!
What is the solution?
The matter is a bit complicated, sir!
I am not interested
in the size of the problem
I am wondering which
engineering college gave your degree!
- Sir! That is...
- That is?
You know what you have done?
The 18 storey building which was
built by us by the plan of sir!
The one of the 2 buildings is...
...The Heavenly Heights
of the Spectrum Constructions!
The other one is Bay
like tower of Metropolis
The approach road is in the middle!
What should be the width?
Sir! 12... It should be 12 meters!
What happened then?
What is the width now?
Did you see now?
Government has brought a stay now
What has to be done with this building?
Should it be demolished?
The company is the loser
if we buy the plot! That's why
What now?
We are trying hard to avoid the loss
We can handle that problem!
You have to do the job
which is given to you!
Almost everyone in the firm...
Even Ravi sir is aware of the problem!
- Where is Ravi?
- He is in the cabin!
- He is in a meeting!
- Call him!
The Approach Road is only 10 meters
which should be 12 meters!
I told already that a
couple of cents are to be added
Isn't it?
I gave you a written statement
duly signed already
Get the blue print here
Isn't it 3 years old?
You told me once that your wife
has a cousin in the ministerial staff
...and he could handle this neatly
He got a good amount for
changing 12 meters to 10 meters
Those guys in the corporation
too got the bribe
Who is taking the
decisions of this kind?
But I have to talk to you only
You too have to be vacated from here
There is a way for that
It is a little out of the box thought
There is money involved
In the long run
our company will have the benefit
If come through Vallarpadam Terminal...
...Kochi will be better
than Visakapattanam Port
Even it could be better
than Mumbai Port!
At the back side of our project... Here!
This is a land of 25cents
It is with a Siva Subramaniyam!
We have to buy that plot
There was no access to his plot...
...as our structure was built up
There would be only
a little space for a scooter to go
We can buy it cheap now
On the opposite side of
Siva Subramaniam's plot...
...on this side of the lagoon
it is the Vypin Cherai route
If we construct a bridge
with our money for us to get there...
...the government will be lenient to us!
Don't you know how to tackle that?
The bridge is the bonus
we offer the government
If the bridge is built
it'll be a short cut...
...to Thrissoor without
touching the high way
We could save one
third of the distance!
Government will be with us
I'll ask dad to talk to the minister!
This talk of ours should be
secretive between us
Secrets are leaked out from inside
I'm not sure if it is
the work of someone who went out
The secrets should be between us till...
...the beginning of this bridge!
I was not worried if there
would a solution for this problem
If I go to dad after
everything is over...
...he will laugh at me!
Before dad...
Dad!
You have to
complete it before you go
Paru! Take the phone
- Is your husband there?
- He is here. I'll give to him
No. It will be difficult
for him to understand what I say
Warn him not to bother others any more
Your over smartness is good
If he didn't play cool,
he will be dead
It was not there for sometime
and he has started again
- What is that?
- Threatening calls!
Threatens to chop the hands and
legs or even get killed!
I doubt if it is your work...
giving money to others!
- For what?
- For showing up before me
You women could only think this way
Lieut. Colonel Bharath
Mohan Lal has told...
...that there should be women
in the army and other forces
They are very crooked minded
Drink this fast.
You will become big only then
I need not go to school
when I am a big girl, isn't it mom?
No. We can go to the college
Are you alone? Come
- When did you reach?
- Yesterday!
What's the secret behind this gift?
Are you expecting a gift like this
next week for your birth day? No dear
You miser!
Don't try to save the entire money
your husband earn
Spend some of it. Ammu is here!
I didn't see you
Is it your mom only
keeping her body thin?
- Go girl.
- When did you come?
Have you become thin a little?
We were talking about thatjust now
She was comparing you with her
When I came in the frame,
the weight has been balanced, right?
Tell her a diet for her
When I am here with a lot of flesh...
...people will think that
I am making her to starve
But you don't seem to become thinner...
...as if you have given
a word to someone!
You are shedding
yourflesh for me too
Tomorrow is your party, right?
You can enjoy it without
any responsibilities...
...being a wife and mother!
She had a name before in the college
Paru scaling tree
Let my wife enjoy all freedom
So, take care.
I'll call you!
Are you building flats like your dad?
- No. It is a house.
- House?
Are you ogling in the office hours?
James! A coffee! Tell me
It's nothing. The launching of the
new project is tomorrow, right?
The costliest project
of our company so far
The dream project I started 2 years ago
My dream project for which
I have spent my brain and mind
When the project is on, I was out
The Brahmin made you the project lead!
You put the elder one
in your pocket when you came here
Now it is his son! Good!
What are you telling, Antony?
I have no specific interest
in the Marine Mirage!
The company instruct me
and I am doing it
That's all
I didn't know that
you had interest in this
You didn't tell me
I will do a thing!
I will tell Navin sir
to make you the project lead...
...afterthe company meeting!
I'll talk to him
The night is very quiete
e don't know when you wiee come
The night is very quiete
e don't know when you wiee come
Are you defeated you young sheep?
- I have won, dear!
- I give up buddy
If he is there to play
it is a defeat for me
He would wipe off the entire money
- What's the fun in that?
- Sit down there
There is a peg more
You have it and go
Annamma is very strict
after the 2nd attack
When I go home and sleep
she will come with the medicine
You won't die if you take a peg more
- Cruel guy is well cared!
- Go
Brother! It is good playing!
But watch Ravi
when he plays with this smarty!
What is it Davis brother?
We are just playing!
My time is good and I win!
- Isn't it?
- Yes.
Yourtime is very best buddy!
No matter if it is in the play
or in the business!
The 70 cent land of
Blue Star Govindan...
Near the Grow park!
When you sold the land
forfifty rupees more...
...Davis brother lost 20 rupees!
I mean 20 lakhs!
Davis brother got the advance back!
But the matter was not ended up fine
It is a good thing
when saying about Time
When it get shuffled up,
the King will...
...become Joker!
You better be as the
King rather than the Joker!
What ever loss you have acquired
we can make it right
For what? It is not needed
It is all by my earnings
that I got in my life so far
I have never asked my dad for anything
How's that?
I wanted to get back
the money I've lost!
I've boarded the bus from
Thrissoor with that in mind
You have a good job!
Isn't that enough?
There are people who can
do the real estate business!
I like you very much
It is not because of
Kaattoor kaaran Pathras!
I was living in a single room
flat in the beginning!
...with some comedies
in the Thrissoor accent
...you have reduced
my sufferings to great extent
That is not a trivial matter to me
I have that affection
and obligation for you!
You should not spoil it
with your nasty dialogue!
Then the matter why
I am in the real estate!
I have a daughter!
My dad has not given me anything!
At least me...
That's the God's wish!
I like your reply
If told in a soft voice,
the matter is very vicious!
Enjoy yourself buddy!
You know that it is
dangerous to oppose me
All you need a small bomb
which I have kept safe for you!
The song which is sung
for us by him daily, right?
After 2 drinks, he used to
say a Konkini obscene language
You can ask the meaning
of it when you want to
See you! We shall meet tomorrow
One minute
No any recommendation!
Only a suggestion!
...for our project...
for another lead...
Who has more interest than you?
Antony is more interested!
He can do better than me
He has a basic taste in the
marine structures and the design of it!
You have to take care of it yourself
I can't take any risk!
When dad hands you over something...
...he has something in mind!
- Didn't I do what I could?
- You somehow managed it
You are smarter in that!
I don't know exactly. Never mind
I'll call you on the way
I'll be there around noon, sir
Our chairman Krishna Murthy sir
who is Navin's dad
...if he calls me to the guest house
a regional head like me...
I should have to stay
there one day any way.
Drinking with the men of the Brahmin!
I have to hear what he says!
...that he started his life
as a porter in the market!
...and the story of Haji Mastan
who became...
...the big builder
in South India, 101st time!
When it is dawn
Ravi Abraham will be the...
...vice-president of the
Atrium Structures!
So you have to go tomorrow!
Then I would cancel my kitty party!
I'll be here with our girl!
It has been planned with Ansi!
Don't consider me as a fool.
Do one thing!
When you were in bed
a girl came as a maid, right?
- What is her name?
- Sicily!
She can be with her!
If so, I will drop her
on the way to office.
Okay! I'll call her.
- Are you from Seva?
- Beatrice!
Sicily have a test.
I came in her place!
Come!
I was late because of the traffic block.
No problem!
It is only getting ready here.
- Where is the kid?
- Here.
- What's your name kid?
- I'm not a kid!
- Amitha Susan Abraham!
- It is nice!
- Ravi! Are you ready?
- Then what?
It is you who needs a thorough make-up!
- I need only a underwear, extra!
- You awful guy!
Who selected you in that office?
It is not Sicily.
She is another girl... Beatrice!
Something is wrong in her name.
Who knows?
Shall I give you a kiss?
Feed lunch to her!
It is difficult.
Mom was saying
that I am very fat! Is it so?
- Dad is perfect!
- Hear...
She will say that.
Do you know who her heroes are?
They are the fat men of the WWF!
They are not fat.
He is Kane
You have spoiled.
Leave it.
Give a kiss to your dad!
You know that Paru
is going for a party!
However late it is,
you can go only after she returns!
I got it.
Keep the charger of the
mobile in the car.
You have not kept it there...
but I have kept it.
What should have I done
if you were not there?
I have heard it already
Get in.
When I wanted to give
a compliment, you are...
Leave it, if you don't like!
Will she be with Beatrice?
Yesterday I told you
about the BP's post.
I think I am bit greedy after it.
But I'll get 80 per cent hike
if it is the post...
...of the Head of Operations!
We went and saw the flat
in Marine Drive once.
In projecting balcony into the sea!
You liked it very much!
I have to buy it.
Do you still remember it?
I was telling just for fun!
What will be the life without any fun?
You know the architect Ajayan?
He is the marketing head of there!
My car has broken down!
Can I get a lift up to there?
Get in.
I am going to City Center...
and I feel relaxed now.
I have an appointment in
the Speed parcel service!!
It is strike and hartal
on that day only.
Not only today.
It is always there.
- What is your name?
- Ravi... Ravi Abraham!
- Is it your wife?
- Yes! Parvathy!
- So it was your inter
cast marriage, right? - Yes
Where do you work?
I mean... yourjob!
I work in Atrium Towers!
- Is this the 20 story towers?
- 21 stories!
Yes! I have come there
I didn't come there!
I had some work there
I had a doubt
when I reached there
- Toilet?
- Yes!
My friend was working there
at that time
...on the third floor!
My friend Santhosh from
Adakkaputhur's office!
...I went to his toilet!
- Which is this car?
- Fortune!
A guy told me about a car!
That's not this.
It is CRV... 2005 model!
They are demanding
- In my hand...
- 12 lakhs is quite cheap!
I have applied in the bank for loan!
- Lf I get that!
- Your car?
It is an old one! A '98 model!
It creates problem at times!
I don't know why.
We don't get together well
Don't laugh! There is a relationship
between human being!
Take us for an example!
We had been together
for only a little time
But we have come closer in that time!
Vehicles are also like that!
There are a few people for example!
Even they are married 20 years ago...
...they won't go together well
with their wives!
I doubt my car and me are like that!
...always creates problem
It consumes more petrol adding
to the problem
It is not towards left.
It is towards right
City Center is towards the left
No... It is towards the right!
No, sir! It is this way
Turn towards the right!
I know it well. It is this way!
Turn towards the right
What?
I said to turn to the right
Look straight and drive it
If I pull the trigger,
you will be dead right then!
You can only stop when I say to
What? What do you want?
I got it what I wanted to get Abraham!
Why not? Isn't it your dad's name?
This call for you only.
I like smartness!
But only when I want it
Is it Ammu? You!
On the other end she is waiting
to hear mom's voice!
- Talk to her!
- Dear!
Nothing dear
I've reached Ansi aunt's house
I'll come fast
Listen to aunt's words! Ok dear?
Don't make me cry too!
I want to talk to my daughter
You cannot be smart life long!
Beatrice is an expert in baby sitting!
What do you want?
How much do you want?
How much do you have with you?
About 30-35 lakhs!
No. You have 77,00,334 Rs
The arithmetic between us
should be exact always!
Give me the mobiles of both of you!
Both are tapped. Yet...
Parvathy can go now
It is ourjoint account!
You need my signature too
to withdraw money
Model wife and husband!
You have joint account
at the time when nobody trust others!
One thing you have to remember!
Ammu is waiting for you there!
Beatrice too is waiting
for my phone call
Ammu is an innocent girl.
Isn't it Parvathy?
You have to remind Ravi at times
Ravi, who is he?
- We should have noticed that Beatrice!
- I have got her from Seva!
I asked you about it
She had a negative approach!
- We shall buy a mobile!
- Why?
- We will call the police!
- To call the police?
Ammu is in his custody!
How do we know
who else are behind him?
What can the police do?
How can we get back Ammu
if at all police arrest him?
We have to obey him, come
Here. It is all in thousands!
Name Ravi Abraham...
We didn't have the check!
We need cash withdrawal forms!
A pen?
Do you want to close the account?
We don't intend to close our account
We want to withdraw the entire cash!
I want to consult the manager!
Why? Why do you
consult your manager...
...when I want to withdraw
my money which is in your bank?
Is this your one minute banking,
you advertise?
We can get money faster
from the money dealers
Don't get panicky!
People are watching!
Go and sit in the car.
I'll handle this
They are!
Go
Ravi was tense
I'll wait here
Your daughter was good
in drawing, isn't it?
When problems affect our relatives...
...we tend to lose ourselves!
It has to be like that
Why don't you give back Ammu?
You have the full amount in that!
- Do I have to count it?
- No
It is correct amount!
It is there what you have asked
My earnings today!
What are you doing?
I will set you on fire
if you stop the car
Start the car
I was irritated when
I saw this much money!
Now, I am relaxed
Call him and tell
that you will come late!
It's me Ravi...
We will come... A little late!
Parvathy is not well
No, we don't know the place!
I'll call you when we come out of here
Aren't you calling now?
If not they will wait
for you there, right?
Don't betray our parties!
I don't think if I could come today
I'll tell you. I'll call you
Do you know what the time is?
You should be hungry!
There is a hotel nearby
We will go there
The car wouldn't go forward now
We will stop here
- There is a hotel nearby this slum!
- You mean here?
This place and the life here
are not suitable...
...to be seen always!
TIPPU SULTAN HOTEL
Sir! Come and sit inside
Shall I serve you nuts?
Have tea! I will get it
What do you want sir?
What do you have?
Tell me what do you want!
Do you have elephant fry?
- What?
- Elephant fry!
- That is sir
- Porcupine?
That's why I've asked you
to tell what you have here
Tell me what you want
in the fish items!
We have variety of fish dishes!
Give us 5 minutes.
We will tell you!
- Aren't you going?
- Where to?
Don't you need money?
I've set fire to that!
I didn't have any money already
You have to pay the bill of here!
You are about to run away from here
You have to travel very far!
You need to fill diesel in your car!
You have to eat food when hungry!
You have to spend a lot of money!
Tell me what your plan is!
What wrong we have done forthis?
We need an answer to that
Is it? Won't you do
the matter I tell you?
The men of now wouldn't
take any decisions!
...at least for our daughter!
Our daughter is in your hands!
- Otherwise...
- You can't do anything!
Don't play to the one
who has nothing to lose...
...and who has a lot to lose!
Nobody knows what he would do
I'll give you half an hour!
You should bring the money...
...or else you wouldn't
see Ammu anymore
A small coffin will come
as home delivery!
- Where are we going?
- Look there
Why don't we call somebody?
How can I call?
All numbers are in the mobile!
I don't remember any number!
I don't remember even my office number!
Whom do I call if I remember at all?
Whom shall I believe?
Will they come if I call
to a place like this?
What to do?
Let us pledge this watch!
- Anyone who is a money dealer?
- Go man
Do you know any pawn shop?
Who has to be pledged among you?
- To pledge my watch!
- Is it your watch?
Are you trying to make a fool of others?
Is your cloth too to pledge?

Bogari! Long ago... not very long!
People called it Beegalgari!
In'98 Renis Rehman...
you know well!
...the one who has computer business
He went to Singapore and
found out that it is Bulgari!
It has another name now... Boogari!
I want to pledge it
Where are you now?
Who will accept watch
these days to pledge?
It was okay if it was Seiko
or Rico in the past!
It is an original one!
I can get you a duplicate one!
Made in Beypoor!
You are talking about Boogari!
Let it be gold or anything
If it is kept on my palm,
my veins will tell me...
...that it is original!
Or else, it would tell
that it is duplicate
An Abdul Karim Haji is near Thrissoor!
He took a few Gold smiths with him...
...and went to Malaysia
to teach them to make watches!
They made Titan and Citizen
watches and sold there
In Kochi, people are posing
as businessmen seeing that.
Those boys do now to prepare
the sample of these items
Those watches are imported to Kochi!
Ok. No pledging!
What price will you give?
If it is 6000 rupees, I am ready
It costs a lakh!
You need not tell me the price of it
It doesn't cost more if it gets old
There is a costlier one with me
Do you want to see it?
The Diagano series!
There is no guarantee card!
There is no box!
There is no cover forthis
How can you ask me more?
- 6000 is too much!
- Ok! Give me 6000 Rs
I am strict as it is the first deal
I can take if you have any more items!
The moving items in Kochi are
Redling and Boban Mercier only!
You bring those items if you have.
We can adjust the price!
- Do you want tea?
- No.
Is there a short cut to
Tipu Sultan Hotel?
It is here only. There is
a road here along the canal!
You go straight in that
road towards West!
It looks like an original one!
See you Hamid!
Give him the bill!
To whom forthese parcels?
The people who need
are out side
I heard that you asked for
elephant fry
Now it is not available here
Once when I was running
the shop in Nunjangodu...
...I prepared that too
I know that
The green beans...
It's for me
It's mine
Don't hit me
Give me
One minute, Parvathy!
Address is in it
You should handover it to there
Can't you do that?
- Me?
- Yes. A small favour
Can't you do?
You can do
I know.
You like Ammu very much
What is this?
It has to reach
Asiankara Achumama's house!
What do you say Parvathy?
I'll give it
I'll give wherever it is
One phone call is enough
I should know that you are there
Don't do anything foolish!
Hey Ambi!
Your child's life is in my hands
Don't forget that
Mind your words
Why are you here?
Any drinks?
No, officially...
Why are you here brother?
I came here nearby...
I am his brother
Kalyana Krishnan
Rukku aunty has come from Thanjavur
Then sister... uncle called and
insisted me to go and meet her
They gave some snacks
- Is he your friend?
- Yes, I am Ravi Abraham
Are you a Christian?
He resembles our Kannama's brother
Same dress and shoes
but not the face
I have no problem
- I'll become companion to everyone
- We are busy now
I am too very busy
Leave it
Seems you both started to go out
to enjoy the weekend
Yes, will you join with us?
With pleasure. I was waiting
for an auto for long.
No one has stopped
I've to give a person
one Jeevan Raksh policy
- Will you go through that way?
- No problem. I'll drop you
No brother! You go
Keep quiet Ambi
When your friend calls me affectionately
it will be a free lift
Then what? Move away!
Not here
Go back side
- Can't you go back side
through this way? - No
It's old model, isn't it?
Seems you are very happy
giving lift to him
By god's grace the person who sat
inside, came as a ball into my court
Let me play with it
Then you can play
It is Cheeda! Made with rice.
You are driving, isn't it?
Have it.
No, I don't want.
Rukku aunty has prepared it.
Have it.
How do you know him?
You might have met him in the bar.
I thought it already
I am his brother.
It means cousin.
What drink do you like?
Whatever it is.
Listen Ravi!
His family was not in a great position
His father retired from
the irrigation department.
His mother was a house wife.
He joined B. Sc in Victoria college.
That time a letter had come.
From Karagpur, llT
That day I told him to join in IT
But he didn't listen.
He opted to take nuclear physics.
I still remember now.
When he was 10 years old...
During the Deewali
and Vishu festivals...
...neighborhood children would
bring Sivakasi crackers to him
He has a technique that
he makes explosives...
...using native medicine and
battery coal and Navasaram
During Deewali festival, we hear
crackers sound in our street
It blasts with a great sound
Then crackers, Now it is the bomb
That's only the difference.
He is the eldest in that house
Ranjani. She is his sister.
She is a lecturer in N.S. S college.
Will you keep quiet for sometime?
What Ambi?
He is your friend, isn't it?
Where do you work?
It is very famous company.
I suffer with asthma
Do you have any interest
in insurance policy?
I am an insurance agent.
World has become very much spoilt.
Wherever we go there are terrorist attack
bomb blast, Tsunami and earth quake
Ok, leave it.
Are you going to bar
or any private place?
- Brother! It is not like that.
- No need respect
We didn't drink together before.
It is right.
Let's start today
Today is the new moon day
and Narakachathurdasi
If you try to find me with
support of my brother...
It won't happen.
There is nothing wrong if I try for it
It's true
But it won't happen
Yes.
Has Ammu eaten anything?
For your nasty behaviour,
it is your child who is suffering.
Brother, his child will
draw paintings well
Brother! We have to go to some place.
Brother! You give
your client the Jeevan raksha policy...
...and get your drink, and wait there
We'll come back soon.
- We have some land dealings
- It's ok. I'll wait there
You go and come back.
I'll meet my client and get my drink
...then I'll wait in thatjunction.
Nearby, there is a beverage shop
Cash... I have only card with me.
They won't accept that.
Ambi, do you have money?
You keep it on account.
I'll give you later.
You get the food
I am pure vegetarian.
You remember it.
If there is pork,
get me some.
Ok. You can go.
What happened to him?
Seems there is something wrong
I haven't seen him in this mood.
Let it be anything.
I'll have two small drinks
These people who fight with another
in the railway station...
...and theater maintain a queue here
What a discipline and humility!
This is possible only for Malayalis.
Here, Can I get a brand
brandy from Karnataka?
I don't know.
Then how will he come good?
In your corporate line
ladder and snake play...
...I am interested to know
how you win always
I was curious to know about that.
Krishna Murthy sir's...
Now you are with Navin Krishna Murthy
You made a play with my brother
to know about my aim.
When you planned a play
with the Palakad Brahmin...
You forgot you are going
to lose your own child.
The plays are not clicking well.
You think that you will
get a promotion...
From the projector manager post
to operation head
Navin Krishna Murthy. Your new boss.
You have him in your hands.
I have a plan to throw
you out from there.
I've long hands than you imagine.
Your company's...
No yours...
An open ticket for you
to lead a luxury life
Over bridge which touches
Vypin Cherai route.
It is the blue print of that
See, your dream project papers
We should keep this secret between us
If it goes out,
you'll be affected than me
I know it sir.
People will know about this,
the day when this project starts.
How will you know this?
What a foolish question!
In this world, even the great
secrets will get leaked!
Your corporate secrets are nothing!
Do you know that building?
You should know that
Your company's important enemy.
Don't be scared. This is only a copy.
Original papers are with Parvathy.
Don't do it.
Not only you are going
to spoil my career.
...but also a good thing
which this town will get.
It is a relief for the people
from this traffic jam of this city.
Do you have interest in social service?
It can't be said, when sees you
Ok. Call and tell to Parvathy.
Don't give it to him.
Before she reaches
to Cynotec MD Mathew's room...
Paru, it's me.
Don't give that envelope to him.
- Ravi, what are you saying?
- Don't give it to him.
We should do what he says.
We can't take risk in Ammu's matter.
What else we should
lose more than this?
Listen to me!
I'll do whatever he says
In the life you don't get
the chances free always.
In one day, your wife
too didn't trust you
It's getting late. Let's go and wait
downstairs of that office.
Else Parvathy will try
to show her smartness
Am I correct?
Are you upset?
Those who don't run in life,
will be upset quickly
You didn't get a chance
to run in your life.
How is your daughter?
Is she adamant?
Let's call her
Connect the line to 106
It's me. There is no problem, isn't it?
Ok, I'll call you.
Parvathy is a nice dame, isn't it?
Even she was roaming since morning...
...she didn't lose her glamour.
Paru, didn't I tell you
not to give the cover to him?
It was a blue print of that bridge.
- But he was...
- I called you after he said to me.
How do I know that?
I was thinking about Ammu only.
It was only that.
Not only you spoiled my career
but also our life.
Did I spoil your career?
Was it me the reason for this?
I didn't say that you were the reason...
You both can talk
I'll just come back
I am not the reason for this.
He is the reason for everything.
First you understand that.
Whatever it is, I'll lose my job.
...and my good will
which I got by hard work...
...and my career which helped
for you to live for you and the child...
Everything will be lost at once.
You shouldn't say that it is
your duty to help us to live
It is your responsibility
She is your child too.
Is it? That's a new matter for me.
But it is for you to blame
me for a mistake...
...you have done.
He too wished to happen this
He wanted to create problems between us
than leaking the bridge plan
Now he have achieved it so easily
Ravi, he didn't take his phone.
He called last time to some hotel room
I am sure.
Ammu will be there
See the number.
No need code
Tell the number!
Ravi, he is coming.
Have you compromised with your problems?
There is a book shop in
Rajiv Gandhi bus station
You just keep it in the basement
- I'll give you one hourtime.
- I can't do it.
What? I didn't hear
Paru, I saw his brothertoday.
He was an innocent. But he didn't know
that his brother...
It's good for you
if you stop this matter here
Not that.
You have a good family
Your father is a retired
government employee
Your sister is working as a lecturer
in Engineering college
Then why you?
Please leave him
Ravi! What will be in this box?
Let it be anything
It is no use to us without
knowing Ammu's whereabouts
Let's call from my phone
No. Your phone may be tapped
Let's make a call from the booth
Hold it
Queens lodge!
Where is it?
Brother! Wait for sometime.
We'll be back now
Come soon
You are very lucky brother!
Ravi! Where is the box?
It is in the auto
If he wants, let him take that
Isn't it a wrong game?
Your game is over
In your hometown,
If I wanted,
I would lock you in the car...
But you should have thought...
...why I kept my mobile in
your car without any reason
You were caught in my trap.
Why do you do like this to us?
Who are you?
Didn't you hear
the story of Thakshakan?
There is no image for the perils
Wherever you hide,
it'll come and kill you
Where is my daughter?
I'll tell you
Why did you stop with one child?
Two children are enough
If one child is lost
another one will remain
Have you done the family planning...
...or has Ravi fed up with you?
It is Ammu's
I won't stand your stamp.
Truly.
But sometimes...
This 6 feet height and
strong physique won't help you
If you step a foot forward...
...Beatrice will crush
your child's neck like this
Parvathy! Do you get scared?
Don't close your eyes Ravi
Look here!
She is enjoying it
Why don't you try modeling?
You have a great figure
As if you are chiseled out!
You...
The moment when you
bring an end for this...
The moment when you
bring an end to this play...
...l'll kill you
I will kill you
That's why I've been waiting
forthe end of the play
Can you bear it?
Parvathy! He spoiled my mood!
There is enough time to become dawn
Now you can go to bus station, Abraham
Let Parvathy stay with me
Else you would think
to show your smartness
You can go
Crackers then! It is bomb now!
That's the only difference!
Don't run
My box!
Catch him!
One is forced to do the sin
even if he is not willing.
Why does this person do the sin?
Here I am doing the sin
but you get the punishment
This is the world's nature, Abraham
I have some remaining sins
to complete in this night
I wish to see your corporate line that
make the client to get...
...mesmerized with your skills
Have you seen that lady in black sari?
Go and bring her
That lady!
I wanted to see
how you fix a rate for her
Go and bring her...
...before crowd gathers for her.
If you don't go
she'll go there
Do you want to see that?
- Are you coming?
- Any discount for the Onam?
You rascal! Go and
ask to your mother
These rascals will come
to irritate me when it is dark.
Am I running a cloth shop
to offer you discount?
Hey saint! What am I seeing?
I thought when you stopped the car
that you wanted to breath some fresh air
Will you come with me?
I'll give you Rs 1000
Oh Jesus! What am I listening?
Are you fixing a rate for me?
It's a shame thing
If anybody listen it,
what will they think?
I will...
What Elise! Seems you are always busy
Where did you put your mobile?
Let me live my life Franchise
Seems your range has changed
You are doing dealings
with rich people
Let me earn when there is
some market, Franchise
Then get ready. I've booked a room
in Metro. Let's go soon
How can I come now?
You go. I'll settle him,
then I'll come there by Raju's auto
What nonsense are you talking?
I've bought Raja whiskey
and beef biriyani for you
What shall I do for that?
Sir! Can you wait for 5 minutes?
I'll finish his dealing and come soon
One more thing...
Some people will come with net!
Don't make trouble for you.
They have AIDS
I can't wait
- I'll give you Rs 1500
- What a man you are!
Haven't you ever seen women?
You go somewhere else
- I can't
- I will...
If you want, give me Rs 750
I'll come with you
You have a good personality!
Why don't you look for a better girl?
You have come to spoil my work.
Dear Franchise!
You go and watch a film!
Finishing his deal,
I'll come there soon
After months,
I've got this nice business
Don't make problem.
You go.
It'll be a bad day for you
Damn his Rs 1500!
Leave the car here
Let's go by auto
My man is there
No
What is this sir?
Are you collecting people?
She is my wife
You people behave in a strange way!
Last month there was a dealing like this
A wife and husband, and his friend
They gave me Rs 2000
He will be yourfriend
Sister! There was a bet
between him and me
I said you'll come if he asks you
But he said you won't come!
He has lost
What is this?
Am I a joker in your card game?
I wish I could go with Franchise
- Take this
- No sir!
I don't take my fees by sitting idle.
It is not your fee
It is for my pleasure
Will you show yourjoy like this?
But some people are there...
Shall I go sir?
See you
Why did you play this
cheap game with me?
After I entered the car...
Did I give you any good reply
for your questions?
Bright moon eight that's heree
Can you guess where we go now?
A wild guess
Can we see our daughter once?
Can we talk to her?
It's enough
if we hear her sound once
I'll do whatever you say
Trust me
In a man's life,
he tells lies to himself
Then how can I trust you?
Burning heart...
Bright moon eight that's heree
The eightning strikes
in the gardene
et is burning in the hearte
Red rays...
en the sand storm of fate...
...the goeden dream
which sheds the petaese
...in the eap of the naturee
...to beossom... where?
Parvathy! We've reached the place...
...where we get a conclusion
for our problems
Parvathy! You stay here
You get down Ravi
The person who you are
going to meet tonight...
...your boss, is inside there
Let's clear your today's problems here
If you think,
the story will end up here
What are you saying?
Me? To kill?
You would be scared to kill
But I am not
Ammu and Parvathy just started
to live their life, isn't it?
Do you want to kill me?
If you like to happen something
to Ammu my presence is not needed.
Beatrice is not the only one with me.
You should have
understood that, isn't it?
You have a family with
mom, dad and sister...
Why do you do like this?
They are nothing before my goal!
As you said just now
How you are here?
Has it been changed now?
This is my house
I should have asked you that
How did you find this house?
I messaged you.
You got that, right?
- What message?
- What Ravi?
Don't you remember what you told me
when you called me in the morning?
You called me as boss and told me
that Parvathy is not feeling well
I'll come but I'll get a little late
Parvathy is not feeling well
You told me like that
I thought something was bugging you
I messaged you
my house address a little later.
Then I called you so many times
I didn't have my mobile
I thought you wouldn't
come today
Do you have a plan to give me a
surprise as you give to Parvathy?
That is your plan.
Why do you feel nervous?
Is it because it is my house?
By scaring the people...
...it had been a long time,
hiding in the lift and office rest rooms
...we enjoyed
But this house is only for us
Forthis day, you told so many
lies to Parvathy
For me, we...
We don't want this
I know why you are out of mood.
Because of long drive,
...guilty feeling, every minute
that you are cheating Parvathy
Don't I have that guilty feeling?
You didn't see that, is it?
The surname in the end of my name
My husband
Venkatesh
Now where is he?
Didn't I tell you that
he went to Delhi this morning?
Else how could we meet here?
Could you imagine it?
What if your husband knows
about our relationship?
Why do you say so?
I can't imagine it.
My Ambi will get shattered.
Why are you saying this now?
He knows everything
My child is in his custody
He'll kill my child
I don't have...
I don't have another way
to save my child, Devi
It is the punishment to us
for the sin we have done
He wants that
I can't sacrifice my innocent child
You don't have another way Ravi
I can't
I can't
- I can't kill her
- But I can
One death is sure
Her death is betterthan
the death of 6 years old child
I can't
Did you see
how much he loves you?
You would have many reasons to tell me
...a husband who always come late
Even if I am nearto you,
you lose the lusty nights!
My busy work
Like many reasons
In the marriage relationship
justifiable things for any women needs
It might be correct
While spending long time in the office
it might happen naturally.
It was the admiring on a smart colleague
who solved problems in the office
Then it changed as love for each other.
I can understand that
But it was not love.
I thought a moment that you wouldn't try
to kill her after meeting her
But you did it
This is not the friendship
It is enough for you the
warmth when you meet her
I thought about her
when you fixed a price for that tart
Before that tart who sells body
for her livelihood.
She appeared to my eyes
in a small position
She is called a tart
You too
You fixed a price for these two bodies...
But when I touched
your wife in the hotel room...
Do you remember how your face was?
Do you remember that pain?
By knowing that I am not here...
...you've come to make
romance with my wife.
Now I've spent
my entire day with you
You rascal! Can you
imagine about my pain?
Where is my child?
She is safe
She is in your house
Dad!
- Aunty and I played hide and seek.
- Is it?
Sleep dear!
No Ravi!
Paru, they together kidnapped
our daughter
She doesn't know anything
That means...
Ammu stayed safely in this house
Without knowing her dad
earned money and career for her
She didn't have any role in this game
I didn't get you
I know. I know everything
I am Devi's husband
I wanted to talk to you
He spoiled not only our money
...but our child's future too
Who said that our money
has been spoiled?
I'll wait here
No need of that.
I'll come tomorrow
Give the slip
So, your aim is to be spoil
my career. Isn't it?
I didn't do that too.
Your career is also safe
You didn't lose anything
Career, money and Ammu. Anything
You made me a fool
whole day and night
Well done
- You...
- Yes, we are...
We thought to make you
understand at least one day...
...how the pain is if a
loved person betray him
When he told everything to me...
...I felt ashamed on myself thinking...
...that I showed my affection
on you every moment...
...without knowing another women's smell
from you during the nights
You didn't lose anything
Except one thing
Awife who trust
your words blindly
You don't get her
I don't have to say any excuses
You can decide
I swear Paru, you fulfilled me
It has just happened
I am notjustifying myself
I knew already about the consequences
than what I got today
I should say
- You can decide.
- I don't know Ravi
Sometimes my mind would pardon you
Because it is not that
I can't find another way for me
Today you suffered a lot for my child...
...and agonized... disgrace
You have a good father in you.
Only for that
Ravi, shall I ask you one thing?
Will you forgive me
if I were in Devi's place?
AFTER ONE YEAR
Ravi, come
Come
Here is the cheque
This is a good thing
Some decent people will give
leftover food for his wife's birthday
But you gave big amount forthe trust
There is no share in this for me.
It is her wish
I've heard about this
hospital very much.
Patients get more affection
and care here than home
My senior Panikkar sirtells always
Patient needs peace than the medicine
We are just trying that
- Ravi!
- What dear?
This is a curious case
She attempted suicide
But it didn't happen.
Her husband saved her
She is alive. That's all
Everyone knows that she can't walk
But one man is there
who does not believe it.
It is her husband!
I just told about him.
He has come
I got the medicine which is prescribed
You got, isn't it?
