Raghava, today too, you will
leave the work incomplete.
ls there a wedding in the house
that you need to be so particular?
Just apply four strokes with the
brush on these walls.
And quickly run around and
polish these teak furniture.
That's all l've told you to do.
But you have been in this house
with your broom and brush since...
...the last few days.
lt's not that there are no other
painters in this village.
But the people here believe that
'' Maadampally house'', is haunted
...with witches and dare not to step
in here.
You were brave enough to come
so l entrusted you with the job.
But if you are bent on cheating
me then there will be trouble.
Sharadamma from Calcutta will
be here any minute now.
Are you planning to stay here
with your broom until then?
Let me tell you one thing, do as
much as you can today and stop.
After that l don't want you
loitering here for this purpose.
l won't pay you any wages for
that then.
Can't you hear me?...
l wonder where he is...
ls he hiding somewhere and painting...
Raghava...
Raghava...
Rajappa...
My god...
My umbrella...
Vaidyare...
The letter for you is va..do you
know any song starting with va...
l know a lot of things with va..
l've been calling you for long,
lf you happen to see
Dasappankutty, ask him to come..
...home to take out the bucket
which fell into the well.
Don't forget...
Had been to Maadampally house
that's why l am late.
Your daughter had been here, she
just left from here.
ls that all. Now what's
happening here..
l just asked Warrior to tell me a
song starting with the letter pa..
Then... did he sleep over it...
-Yes. And l gave him Ta.
Then.. here it is...
Without taking the key at dawn
from the...
Wait... say that... without giving the
key...
Yes, of course...
Without taking the key at...
lt's not like that, what's wrong
with you today?
l have not taken it, that's all..
l've forgotten to take the key
from Maadampally house.
Dasappa, that girl from the
Thekkedath house has been ...
...looking for you. She said that
a bucket has fallen into the well.
l know of it.
l am going there now.
Who's it?
Oh it's you -Where are you
going?
l was on the way to your place.
Has it been taken out?
No, but how come you know of
it?
Our vaidyar told me. You should
have sent Alli to me earlier.
But l haven't been to the house
as yet.
Then come. We'll go together and
get it out.
Are you not afraid
of going out at night?
Me, of course not. Are you afraid?
Not at all. l thought
of taking it tomorrow...
...but l won't get sleep
until l take it.
lt's the heat. l'll take it out and
give it to you.
Once you pour few mugs of
water over you, you'll feel better
lf only l could get a shovel from
some where..- A shovel, what for?
That's not necessary,
l'll get into the well.
But why do you have to enter a
well to take out the key from ...
...Maadampally house.
lf you take the key,
then what about the bucket?
Bucket    What bucket?
- The bucket that fell into the well.
What's wrong with you, you kept
on saying, you'll take it out.
Are you trying to fool me? You
just come with me now.
Where are we going?
Didn't you understand?
...to Maadampally house.
At this time of night. l thought
we were going to take out...
...the bucket.
You don't have to think a lot
just come with me.
On which day were you born?
A Friday.-Oh  so, afraid.
ls it?
Talk softly..
lf you are afraid, just sing a song.
l am going to sing one.
Hey...-What's it?
-Who has opened the door?
Just take the key...
Who is going there, Dasappa?
Yesterday night the person you
saw at Maadampally is trapped...
...inside. You wait here. lt's none
else than that Tamilian lady.
The fact that you did not wait
there was because of your luck.
l've made these Talismans after
praying.
l am scared
-There's nothing to fear.
Nothing at all. My talismans are
very effective.
Without uttering a word, tie them
to the four corners of the house.
l want to urgently go to the loo.
-Go...
Yesterday night you were so
afraid, it's shameful.
A man has to be in control of
his senses. He must be brave.
Anyway since l was present, let
no one hear of this event.
Are you hungry? What is it?
l want to use the toilet
Sister...
What's it, Dasappa?
l have been calling out to you
for so long.
Did brother tell you anything
today? l mean ''tell'' you?
To me, no...
Why do you ask?
Then brother has had this illness
for some time now.
Why, what happened? He went
out in the morning without...
...telling me a thing.
That's exactly how he is even
now, he is not saying a word.
No other illness.
Not speaking. l want to see him
this minute.
Has he been taken to a hospital?
No, he is in the toilet.
ln the toilet    Yes, there's nothing
to fear. Come along.
What senseless things are you
saying?
Yesterday night he got a scare
at Maadampally. l told him not to...
...go alone if he is afraid and
that l'll come along.
Yesterday what happened at that
house, you never said anything.
How are you feeling now?
You can't speak. Oh, God
What's all this you are doing?
Did you see...
Oh God, what will l do? Leave
him. l shall go to big brother.
l'll ask him to give you a
talisman. Leave me..
No need of any talisman, all he
needs is an electric shock.
He got scared.
Yes, that's what Dasappan said.
He is just not answering me.
lf you could chant something and
give it to me...
He may have entered there at an
unsafe hour saying hymns.
He couldn't sleep without taking
charge of the inheritance of...
...those people from Calcutta.
And now what happened?
He filled Sharadamma's ears
with tales and took the...
...key to that house from me.
Long ago famous Tantrics have
chanted powerful chants and ...
...have exorcised the place and
trapped the haunting spirits ...
...in a room. Your husband
is new to this place.
l told him not to have anything
to do with the house.
He never listened to me.
Okay, l'll give you a enchanted
thread. But will he tie it.
Yes...
-Then come.
Give it to me.. l came first.
Without speaking a word go and
tie it.
Hey, you will tear it. ...
l told you
What's happening there?
-Nothing...
Hey, look who's here
Ganga, that's uncle.
l thought only sister Sharada
was coming.
l had no idea you were coming
too.
So, where are the others?
We came alone, there's no one
else. Meet Ganga.
Yesterday we arrived very late
from Trivandrum.
We did not want to disturb you
so we went to Maadampally.
You two stayed there alone
yesterday night.
Well, l saw the key in the door,
so l asked Ganga to wait outside
...while l went in to check if
anyone was home.
No one was there.
-Then what did you do?
l thought it was too late to
wake you all.
So we rented a
room in the town.
Well, who is this...
do you know us?
How is that possible. Nakul has
never brought you here after ...
...you were married.
Well, ask him when was the last
time he came here.
Ganga, this is my aunt, this is her
daughter Jayshree.
How are you? How you have
grown
She's Alli. My uncle's
daughter.
Hey, aunt you  too are here. What
is the occasion? How's uncle?
What?...
Okay, don't say a word. Just go
and tie it on him.
That is a talisman for your
uncle. That's why she is silent.
That is uncle's eldest daughter,
Sreedevi.
Did my aunt not come with you?
She was to, but my sister came
and took her to Bombay.
Anyway nowadays who wants
their ancestral house.
Don't worry, l've planned to stay
here for a few days.
Until the work on the new plant
gets over, we'll stay here.
That's nice. Come dear.
l assume you will be here for
Then you can stay here with us.
No uncle, we'll stay at
Maadampally.
At Maadampally - Yes, why?
lt's true that Maadampally is your
ancestral home and your mother...
...is entitled to a share in it but
that house is not good for staying.
That house is haunted since
some time.
You may have heard of it in your
childhood.
There have been many untimely
deaths there.
Girls from outside families who
stay there after marriage are...
...harassed... Ganga is a girl
from another family
These are all very outdated
rumours. Who believes them now?
You don't have to worry
because l told you.
lf you have decided to stay
there, go ahead.
You can go round and see
everything.
You will come here.
Now l have a few words to say
to you...
Did you think l've lost my
tongue?
So your illness has disappeared.
Yes it has. l shall remove any
other illness l had in the morning
What did you say? l should be
given an electric shock.
Who do you think you are to
give me an electric shock?
Are you a lineman with the
Electricity board? You...
Don't come close or play games
with me. l'll stab you.
That is Nakul's wife Ganga.
l will hit you..
Don't follow me.
Oh, you are coming from behind
to scare me?
What is it, Vasudha?
What is it you want? ...
Tell me.
What is this you are doing? lf
anybody sees us, it's shameful.
lt's true, we are husband and
wife, if you want l'll come home.
l said l'll come home.
Leave me. What has happened to
you to behave like this?
lf anyone sees us then we would
rather die.
Sreedevi...
Stop pulling me.
Where are you taking me?
No one told me that
they are coming back but yet...
...l keep my door half-open
everyday.
Always, l wish someone dear to
me will come.
lt's so quiet here. Such a nice
atmosphere.
Do you like it here, Ganga?
Of course, it's so much better
than what l had expected.
Aren't you coming to sleep?
l'm feeling sleepy.
- You sleep.
Are all these books yours,
sister?- Let these be...
...kept here for now. We will
shift them somewhere later.
What is it? - Have you
read this?-Yes, Why?
The author is my teacher in the
college- ls it P. Mahadevan?
He is...- Then what...
You know it. -No..
-Yes, you know.
Mother must have told everything
to you.
What?-Nothing, sister
Alli wait...
What is it? Tell me
My marriage has been fixed.
Why didn't you tell me earlier?
Has everything been finalised.
Yes, in July. He stays in the
adjacent house.
Where? - See there.
l want a room to arrange all my
books neatly.
l have been looking for one since
yesterday.
There are so many rooms
here. Come, l'll show you.
l don't want just any room. l
want a room with windows...
...looking out to the mango
orchard.-Come, let's see.
No one ever comes here.
-Come, let us see.
Sister, l think that room faces
the East.
See, there is some talisman
tied here.
lt's locked too.
That's alright. we can get the
key from father.
Daughter...-l think it is uncle.
-Come, let's go.
Come in dear.
Where have you been?
- Upstairs.
This is an old house. There
are certain limitations here.
There are rooms on the southern
side, where no one ever goes.
Those rooms have been locked
up after certain Tantric rituals.
Every year during Durgashtami
festival these rituals are done.
The souls of two youngsters
who had untimely deaths were...
...exorcised and trapped in there.
Today's youth might not
believe it.
You don't go there, That's what,
l came to tell you.
Why should we challenge
the dead?
Who were these people who
died?
Some 150 years ago there was a
powerful Nobleman.
He brought a dancer from
Tanjavur, and she stayed here.
Her name was Nagavalli. She
loved a third person.
He was a dancer called
Ramanathan.
Once he came in search of her
and stayed in the adjacent house.
Somehow, the Nobleman got to
Know of this.
That night he killed Nagavalli in
that room upstairs.
lt is said that on the night of
Durgashtami her soul took the...
...form of a witch and
entered that room to kill him.
The Nobleman chanted some
powerful chants and was saved.
But after that her soul roamed
this place day and night.
Then they brought a famous
Tantrik, who performed rituals.
He managed to snare her soul
into that room and secured it ...
...with a powerful talisman.
Eventually the old nobleman too
drank poison and died.
His soul too is trapped in the
same room.
These are stories our
grandmothers told us.
Who knows,
what is the truth?
Do you know who is staying now
at the house Ramanathan stayed?
lt's Alli's fiancee,
a college lecturer.
Your mother has often told me
that there are many valuable ...
...things in this house.
l've looked everywhere but never
saw a thing.
l think it might have all been
kept in that locked room.
So that no one would enter to
steal those things, all these ...
...ghost stories may have been
made up.
l want to open that room.
What do you say?
Open it if you want to.
They just came and
gave the key.
Better open it before anyone
comes here.
Shall l go now? Have to go to
college. l will come later.
Come once and see...
Won't you seek the gate?
Please come...
Let me get a glance of you
today...
Just once...
Please fulfill my longing to
see you... Fulfill it.
That room has been barred and
protected for a long time now.
Father too warned you, yet you
got a key made to open it.
l came to stop you, but you
seem to have opened it already.
lt wasn't the right thing to do.
Now l wonder what will happen.
What is there to fear if l have
opened a room in the house in...
...which we are staying is what
l fail to understand.
Do you believe all this?
How can l not believe?
The locksmith who made this key
is bedridden with sores on him.
And that boy, Chandu's friend
who took the key to be made...
...he is down with fever too.
l and Chandu will stay here for
a few days just in case...
lf at all anything happens we
will all bear it together.
Until l get this pooja done for
repentance, and install this holy...
...vessel in that room and tie a
holy thread, l will not get peace.
Someone is going to come this
way one day. l know that.
A dear one will come this way
is what l always wish for.
Even now it's what l hope
for today.
Many a time has the season of
flowers lost it's way...
... there are no flowers on
the mango tree branches...
For that alone there should be a
season when it blooms.
l know there's no one to come
yet l wait at the door...
Without knowing for whom it is,
l wait inside the door expectantly
l wait expectantly.
A person dear to me will come
is what l wish for always...
With promises to meet again,
he left me ...
l knew he would not
come...
But l stand at the main
door regularly, waiting for him.
A person dear to me
will come.
At the door like a statue l wait
hoping you will come.
Unexpectedly, l felt that l heard
someone's footsteps.
The spring should bring
something and remain forever.
lf it should bring something...
At times, l run with hope on to
the path with eager eyes...
...someone who lost his way has
come and gone...
...comes and goes back...
Will you sing a song in that
Raga?
Who are you?
- Me only, Nagavalli...
My God...
Oh God...
Nakuletta,
Ganga...
Wake up, someone is knocking at
the door. l think it is Sreedevi.
What happened?
Please come, the maid has seen
something and she's screaming...
...with fear. She is breathless
and has a pain in her chest.
What is it? ...
What happened?
She says she saw something
that scared her.
What happened, Shanta?
l heard the sound of anklets and
woke up.
There she was at the window
with her hair open.
You are just hallucinating. You
think of all sorts of things...
...before sleeping and then get
scared.
You can sleep in the next room
if you are scared here...
What happened?-See, someone
dropped it and it broke.
Don't cause unnecessary
problems.
Who is here to open her hair
and walk, or break things?
Don't make up stories and lose
your job.
Come...
Sreedevi, you too...
Who has arranged for all
these people?
lt was Uncle.
Then ask Uncle to get rid of
these people.
They are the ones who cause
trouble saying things like...
...there are witches and ogres in
Maadampally and ghosts...
What's all this?
Chandu, you go to sleep. we'll look
into all this tomorrow.
Go,... you too Sreedevi.
Come, don't be scared.
Let me speak first and you don't
tell me any excuses.
Just listen to what we say
without any arguments.
What is it?
You take Ganga and stay at
some other place now itself.
Why?
This house is a disturbed house.
You don't have to stay to know
the truth.
Let us conduct the necessary
rituals, then you come back.
l am the only person to advise
U in the absence of your mother
There was something else that l
wanted to speak to you about..
Don't back-answer.
Just do as we say.
This is not the time to argue.
Uncle, since you have spoken so
much, atleast let me say...
lt's Ganga...
What happened...
Her sari caught fire.
Ganga, what happened?
Lie down.
What happened?
l don't know how it happened...
l came to know only after the
sari had caught fire.
Where did it happen?
l never went inside the kitchen, l
was standing in the verandah.
Was there anyone else with you?
There wasn't anyone else, only l
and Sreedevi.
Don't get up now...
-Now l am okay, you can go.
Alli, give me a sari.
Uncle, can you please come
here?
What is it?
Don't mind my asking you,
l have few doubts.
l can't tell it to anyone else
but you.
Please be clear about what you
want to say to me.
l wanted to ask you if Sreedevi
had any psychological problems.
lf you have ever felt anything of
the sort, be free to tell me.
We will show her to
a psychiatrist.
Whatever are you saying?
You and that modern girl did
things here which you should...
...not have done and so all
this happened.
How can you hold Sreedevi
responsible?
Did you know what happened
here last night?
You would not agree to anything.
So l came here yesterday night
to install a holy vessel in that...
...room without telling you.
Do you know what we saw?
Would you believe it if l told you?
We saw that dancer from the
south with our own eyes.
Dasappan and the Tantri are
witnesses.
Oh  So you saw it too. Then
there's no room for doubt.
Everyone here is...
What do l say...
What senseless things, are you
saying?
What is wrong with Sreedevi?
Since l am the head of the
family there are a few things...
...l need to do here. After that
you can come here to stay.
Will you or won't you leave
from here today?
No, l and Ganga won't go away
no matter what anyone says.
You can do as you wish but l
have also decided that ...
...something needs to be done
about Sreedevi.
What happened?.. What's the
problem?...
He is not concerned about
leaving.
He is not at all concerned about
those blood-thirsty souls that...
...have been let loose.
According to him, it is my
daughter, who has a problem.
Sreedevi     What could be wrong
with her?
That's something you had better
ask him.
There's no reason she should
have a problem.
Now it was only this much, if l
hadn't noticed it could have...
...been more serious. Did you
hear me well?
We didn't go near her.
-ls it?
No... Don't cause any more
trouble here now.
Do not use the gas stove, you
start using the kerosene stove.
What is it, uncle?
No, it's nothing.
What is it?
Brother-in-law, listen to me,
there's something wrong with...
...Sreedevi. - What?..
-Something is definitely wrong.
Yesterday, that Tamilian lady
who came down from that room..
...won't disappear just like that
l have a doubt she has entered
inside Sreedevi.
Yes...
Come and see for yourself.
What is it?
What is it?
lt's nothing. Nothing is wrong
with you.
You continue swinging like that
till morning.
What is it, father?
Daughter
What is it, mother?..
What is it Uncle, Aunt?...
-Nothing.
You tell me what it is.
l want Dr. Sunny here.
There is a lot of problem here.
Day by day the patient is going
from bad to worse.
lf he can't help now then, what
use in his being a psychiatrist.
Please inform him now.
Uncle had wanted Sreedevi and
Nakul to get married.
But there was a problem in
Sreedevi's horoscope.
lt was however a good match
with his.
Yet Nakul's mother was not
happy and so she refused.
ln revenge, uncle got Sreedevi
married on the day of Nakul's
marriage to you without revealing
the problem in her horoscope.
Finally when the groom came to
know of it, he sent her back.
Since then Sreedevi is here.
Now after you all came, she
was again happy.
But that too had to end like
this. lt is all one's destiny.
lf the Tamil lady from the room
has entered Sreedevi then the ...
...nobleman, who came down
with her must be around here.
No... Don't come for me l say.
l will prick you.
l am only related by marriage to
Basura, to this house.
l am telling you...
don't come near.
Don't come near me,
nobleman.
l have already told you not to
play with me.
l am just a relative and play
with the many youngsters here
What is it...
What is it, Uncle?
Uncle, What uncle,
Which uncle?
Who has let her loose?
What happened, uncle?
You don't call me uncle.
You Tamilian lady...
Uncle...- Don't come near me. l
am bad to the bad.
Don't call me uncle and kill me.
Just go away.
Someone save me.
Come fast, he's killing me..
Who is it?
Oh, so it's you
ls this the mad person,
you spoke of?
He is very violent, he should
have been locked up.
Lock me...
Let him go...
Don't do anything to him,
listen to me.
He says he is a senior member
of the family.
What member, what senior? He
says he is Basuda's husband.
Who is this Basuda?
-My wife and his aunt.
Let him go, he's my uncle.
Oh, your uncle
Yes, by marriage. - l am sorry.
Don't touch me.
Since you came to hit me with
an umbrella l thought,...
...there was something wrong
with you.
Anyway, l am sorry, uncle.
He is a famous doctor from
America.
He treats Psychic cases.
-Psychiatrist?
Did you tell this madman
there's nothing wrong with me.
l mean the mad-people's
doctor?
How did you land here? l called
everywhere to locate you.
Not without use; now l am
specialising in Mahendra hypnosis.
lt is in great demand in America.
My Lord     ...
Dear Sunny, tell me the truth.
How did you come here?
From the pilgrimage centre of
Sabarimala.
You called my house, and they
called Ramachandran.
l got news about your problem
in Madras and flew down here.
Who's that?...
Your patient...
No, a distant relative.
Relative... Then via Madras, i
came to Cochin, then to the ...
...temple of Sabarimala, then
Kottayam, then back here ...
...by an auto-rickshaw.
ls this the patient?
He is my maternal uncle.
He is the friend l spoke to you
about, he's a psychiatrist.
He has acquired a gold medal
from America.
He is very famous, Dr. Sunny
Joseph.
My daughter is not mad. You
don't make her one.
Then l came from place to place
in an auto-rickshaw...
What? No, nothing, then l came
in this auto to your Maadampally.
What happened?-Nothing. She came
and peeped just now..-Who?
The one you told me about,
Rashmi.-Oh  Sreedevi
But it's difficult to treat and
cure her. She is a little older.
You must have seen my aunt.
-Your aunt
You have a bath, change your
robes, study the problems here.
Okay, l'll do all that, but there
is enough time for that.
Where is your wife?
Who is it?
Sister Ganga
Nakuletta...
l'll come too.
Nakuletta...
She's inside here.
She will suffocate in there.
Break it...
Tell me, Alli,
what happened?
When l went upstairs, l felt
someone was following me.
l ran, l got into this room but
someone locked it from outside.
Why did you go up?
To look for sister Ganga.
Who told you, l was upstairs?
Sister Sreedevi.
But she had seen me go for a
bath downstairs.
Sunny, come with me.
You saw everything. These are
the problems here.
What sort of behavior is this?
What does she mean by this?
You understand the seriousness
of it.
l'll give you the Prasadam,
.
Where is my bag? All the
Prasadam was in it.
Oh my God
l vow by the name of God,
l'll get the person who did this.
l will get him.
Stop, stop.
Where are you going?
l am going to meet a tantric.
after that night's episode...
...there have been bad events
happening in the house.
l am going to meet a famous
tantric to ask him a solution.
You too can come.
Well, who's this. ls it
Padmanabhan Sir?
Padmanabhan
-No, not you...
Oh, it's you Unni Sir
Who's this? lsn't it Kunjankutty?..
Send him out.
-Out...
Go fast..
You go get a talisman, there's
something wrong with you.
Who is this? ls it Meenakshi...
Why you are in a scooter?
Not a girl, but it is me,
Dasappan, brother.
Brother, something wrong in
Maadampally.
Our Sreedevi has become mad.
-Well said. See me properly
There is some problem.
Sunny...- Yes- What are
you looking for?
Where is the bathroom?
-lt's there.
l have no Mundu,
.
Give me a mundu.
You go ahead,
l'll send you one.
To the left...
-Yes
Where's my Mundu?
Who is it there, speak up?
Who is there who took my
Mundu?... Who is it?
Who are you, girl?
-lt's not a she, it's a he
Who is he?-lt's me.-Who me?
lt's me the doctor Sunny.
Okay. Give me back my
Mundu.
l had come for my bath and
taken it off.
l have worn it.
That's not right. What do l
wear now.
l'll give it back to you now.
Did you recognize me?
l wanted to see you.
Stop talking to me like that or
else...
When l saw you l knew you were
not the right sort of person.
Give me back my clothes.
Wait, wait, no one need
know.
Give me some time either in the
morning or evening.
l'll do whatever is possible.
You dog... lf you speak any more
nonsense l'll show you.
lf anyone passes by what would
they say   Give me my Mundu.
Here take it back. Don't you allow
a man to wear a mundu also?
l came here in the afternoon.
We met outside the bathroom.
You never asked me my name.
Why didn't you ask me, why l
came here?
l know you are the one who has
come from America to treat me.
So, you know everything.
Okay, now the doctor is ready.
But l need a patient too.
That's why they have kept me
here. All of you treat me.
So you agree... you are the
patient. That's enough.
Don't you want to sleep?
Come, l'll show
your room.
You don't worry about where or
when l sleep.
Just pretend l am not here.
Did you meet Sreedevi?-Yes,
but it is the primary stage.
We can cure that. You go sleep.
Today there won't be any trouble.
You can call us if you need
anything. - Good night.
Sreedevi...
Sreedevi...
Who is it? ...
Who is it?
Who is it?
-lt's Nakulan.
What is it?
Nothing... There was some...
Won't you come once to my
house to see me?
Won't you show yourself today
and fulfill my longing?
l am a lady suffering due
to your separation.
l am a lady who has none to
adorn her with flowers.
l am like a bird stuck in net
spread by someone and...
...l am trying to find my mate.
Won't you come atleast once
to my house to see me?
Wait...
Why were you roaming
here? -l had to go to the toilet.
Upstairs...
-No.
Then why did you run on seeing
me?
l wanted to go to the loo
urgently.
When, where...
To the loo...
-You do it here...Yes, do it
l saw...
l saw the vessel.
Eeks
-The vessel...
lt's not right to roam at
night...Vessel.
l am saved.
Vessel...Vessel
Did you sleep here yesterday
night?
Yes, yesterday night after the
dance performance, it was late..
What dance performance?
Who is learning classical dance
here? - Nobody here.
Yesterday night l heard someone
upstairs dancing with anklets on.
With anklets?...-Yes
-Did you really hear it?
l heard it but l did not see the
person.
The room to the far east.
But it is locked.
Why doesn't someone sleep there
at night?
But that is not locked any longer
and no one sleeps there.
Maybe, it was my imagination.
Come, let's go and see.
Tea?- l'll have it later.
Give me my glasses.
This is not locked.
-Not locked...Yes..
So this is the disputed
room mentioned by Nakulan.
lsn't he the cruel nobleman?
He doesn't seem to be a good
person by his looks.
Where is the second party to all
this, the dancer?-Come.
See, it's her.
So, l was wrong, Absolutely wrong. -What?
That old man was a good
person, a nice person.-What?
lf she is the dancer, who was
also Ramanathan's lover,...
...then l won't blame the old
nobleman for kidnapping her.
What a structure
Don't you want to see the house
where Ramanathan lived?
See, there.
So this is where the girl
Nagavalli used to sing...
Come and see me once...
Come and meet me once..
Don't you want to see her
ornaments?
See...A gold chain of jasmine-
buds  Mango shaped chain
A gold ring.
A gold coin necklace.
An ornament worn on the head.
Where are the anklets?
lt must be here somewhere. My
tea must be cold...
Have to go to the toilet...
Stop there.
What is that sound when you
walk?
What is the tinkling sound when
you walk?
Anklets..
From where did you get it?
-ln the hall.
So that's it  you are the one who
roams around here at night.
No... -Then why did you put it in
your pocket.
l wanted to know if it made a
noise, if l put it in my pocket.
ls it?
Then, l will keep it.
Do you want it?...
-No.
Then go... Vessel...- What ?
- Vessel...
How are you?
Why did you call me yesterday
night?
lt must be part of your
treatment.
Whatever you feel,
it is a good sign.
Even if you give the right
answer l want to cross-check.
What is it?
Even if you give the right
answer l want to cross-check.
Don't touch me,
go.
What was he trying to do,
putting his hands inside windows.
He's not a good sort. He tried
to flirt with me the day he came
Be careful.
Get up...
Let's go to the temple.
We'll go later...
Take Sreedevi too with you.
What?
When you go to the temple, take
Sreedevi with you.
What for?
Don't ask me why. l can say or
do as l please.
Maybe l can sleep with the girl
who was once to marry you.
Shall l?... You must consider it
as part of the treatment.
Go to the temple, be close to
her like you did in your youth.
Let me see and learn.
ls it necessary?
Yes, absolutely. lt's necessary
lt is needed, Nakulan.
Poor thing. Did you decide on the
line of treatment?
Consider all this as part of
the treatment...-Why?
They are friends after all.
At this rate, you better think of
getting married again.
What are you saying? So that's
what you think of Nakulan.
l was just joking. Leave it.
You are always like this. You
always find fault with everyone.
Yes, that's right. l'm seeing a lot
of wrongs in the southern room...
...of Maadampally. -ln the southern
room?
What is it?
-Nothing.
l think there's a lot of shady
things going on there.
There are many costly things in
there... Did you see this?
This is Nagavalli's anklet. Where
did you get it from?
You mean the 150 year old
anklet?-Yes.
Then you are wrong. This is not
that one.
This is not even five years old.
Which means the original's stolen
The anklet of Nagavalli has gone
from the Southern room.
Where will it go?
This is the same one.
You may think so, but it is not
the original one.
You keep quiet, Sunny. l have
studied about old artifacts.
This is the Original one.
You know nothing. This is not
Nagavalli's anklet.
Yes, yes, yes.
And if it's not?
-And if it is.
No, l say.
-Yes, it is.
Who said so?
-l am saying it.
l have studied a
lot about all this.
Well, So have l.
lt is not Nagavalli's anklet
l say it is Nagavalli's anklet.
Don't argue.-Who's arguing?
ls it me?
-No, it's me.
l'll prove beyond doubt it is not
her anklet.
You don't know a thing.
Me, me, me...
There's no use arguing amongst
ourselves. You go.
What is it? What happened?
She is arguing unnecessarily,
as if all others are ldiots.
She maybe your wife, but
l can't accept...
Why are you behaving like a
kid? Let it go. -Okay.
Why am l here without you?
Can a fish live without water.
By continuously looking at...
...the path, through which you'll
be coming, my eyes are tired
Can't you hear the noise of the
anklets of a dancer which...
...will tell you the story of a
lady who is fading away.
Who is it?
Who is it?
Who is it?
l am Sankaran Thambi.
You cruel man,
Open the door.
Open the door.
Open it...
Who are you?
You rascal, you ask me who l
am. l am Nagavalli.
Why have you come?
To kill you and drink your
blood.
Open the door.
You cannot kill me Nagavalli.
Open the door. l am going to kill
you this Durgashtami day.
Then only my revenge will
be fulfilled.
Then come on Durgashtami.
Now you go, Nagavalli.
Now l'll go, but l'll be back. To
kill you and drink your blood.
You don't have to worry any
more.
My previous life's good deeds
has made...
The famous Tantric l spoke to
you about has agreed to ...
...take up this case. You need not
worry any more.
He said if there's any ritual to
be performed...- Sit...
...he will surely come here.
The Navaratri festival which was
earlier conducted by our family,...
...has to be conducted this time.
You don't object. lt's important
for the family.
l have no objections to holding
any festival.
But l don't want you to call
tantric's to treat Sreedevi.
What are you saying? You know
nothing.
You have called some guy to
treat Sreedevi. lt's not right.
He will give her an injection to
make her unconscious.
And nothing is going to change.
What is it?
Look there, it's him.
-Where?
There, there...
How can we get rid of this guy?
He says he is a doctor.
What doctor?
He will make us all mad. l say,
...where are you?..
What is it with you? You seem
to be wherever l go.
Come on... up here.
What?
-What are you studying for?
B.A.- What's your second
language?
lndi- Oh, lndi.
No, hindi.
Then how come you know Tamil.
l... Don't play with me.
l will hypnotize you.
Do you know music?- No
Then how come you were singing
in Tamil yesterday night?
You look like a pretentious
guy to me.
l have seen you in many
suspicious circumstances.
l won't spare you. What do you
roam at night for?
You want to go to the toilet all
the time.
From where do you get all this urine.
Tell me the truth, lf l start
hypnotizing you, l can't stop.
l want to help my sister. l know
all of you will make her mad.
l know...
No Chandu...
l was just joking.
l didn't expect you
to be so innocent.
l just can't joke with
anyone here
Here take this... Everyone here is
very serious... Come...
l am going to tell you
something serious.
You don't roam around here at
night.
There is going to be an accident
at your ancestral home.
Do l look like, l am joking?
lt's not a joke. lt can happen.
Anytime today or tomorrow.
Definitely before Durgashtami.
Only you know of it now. No one
else should know.
What can be done?
Let's see. Do you trust me?
Yes
-Then tell me where Yevur is?
Yevur. That's a bit far.
Both of us will go there today.
Let's go get Alli's cycle.
lt's about 10 to 20 kms. away.
We'll go by bus.
lt's only 20 kms. away. We'll go
on cycle. Go get Alli's cycle.Go fast...
Many a time has the season of
flowers lost it's way...
...there are no flowers in the
mango tree branches.
Someone who loves me will
come... the cuckoo sings...
The cuckoo sings and says...
Unexpectedly, l felt that l
heard some footsteps
The spring should bring
something and remain forever
lf it should bring something.
ls no one home?
Who are you?
We have come with a message
from Brahmananda Namboodiri.
This is a list of things to be
kept ready for the rituals.
He'll come here on the morning
of Durgashtami.
So, there's a problem?
He'll tell you himself. He's asked
you to get everything in the list.
He has asked everyone of you
including servants to be careful.
lf anyone is ill, take special care
of that person.
We will leave now.-Will you
have something to eat?
No...
- Or drink?
The head priest has asked us
not to eat anything from here.
Did you hear that? what are we
supposed to do now?
Till the head priest comes, we
have to take care of Sreedevi.
To take care of...
-Lock her up.
Why are you insisting on locking
her up?
We'll decide what has to be
done.
lt's better to lock her up.
You are the one who should be
locked up.
You have come here, blowing
your own trumpet from America.
Knives, penknives and axes. Are
there any more of these here.
Where are you taking them all?
We are going to have a
collection.
l need it here for cooking
Just do as l say. ls that all?
Here is the iron-prick for
papadams.
Let it come.
Who has put it here?
Nakula...
Don't drink that.
There's poison in it.
l told you to lock up Sreedevi.
Lock up Sreedevi...
Lock up Sreedevi...
No, don't ...Father ...Father...
No.. No...
Open the door
Open the door
No...
Open... open...
l won't allow this.
l won't allow this.
Tell that doctor...
Tell him to give me that poison
and let me die. l will die.l won't live.
Move..
Move...
Did l do it? Tell me ...
did l do it?
Tell me...
Did l do it?
ln the songs of times gone by,
there was an old man...
...there was a bird dozing
inside a historical room...
...filled with lot of
sorrowful memories of love.
Oh beauty  Are you lost
in those memories?
A soulful tune is reflected
as a dream in your eyes.
The song of parting is here,,,,
Even the veena is silent...
The song of parting is here,,,,
Even the veena is silent...
The song of parting is here,,,,
Even the veena is silent...
The fallen branch felt the
pain of separation.
The eyes and heart felt
the same kind of darkness.
The bird entered the trap and
locked itself...
The bird entered the trap and
locked itself...
...and has forgotten the lines
in her song.
Chose to melt away like frozen dreams...
...there was a bird dozing
inside a historical room...
...filled with lot of
sorrowful memories of love.
Oh beauty  Are you lost
in those memories?
A soulful tune is reflected
as a dream in your eyes.
ln the songs of times gone by,
there was an old man...
Has a snake doctor come
from Africa... No..
Shantamma said that a mental
doctor come from America
l want to see him
-l am that fortunate one.
Rajappan and Kuttapan are saying
that my behaviour has changed.
Please check me, doctor.
Your behavior has some
problem-Then start treating me
l will do it but after some time.
l have locked someone in a room
and started her treatment
After that l will attend to your
case.
While going, do not touch water
as water is dangerous to you.
Water... There is water there
See... water
lt has been a traditional family
festival for years.
Once the head priest has said it
must be revived, then it must be.
lt's just for three days.
We'll all come together and make
it a grand occasion. That's all.
Didn't you go to the temple to
see the dance performance?
lt is a bore.
l don't want to go.
After staying in a village it
wouldn't be good not to see it.
Okay, we'll go.
And you?
l am ready.- Wait a minute.
Everyone has gone taking
Sreedevi with them.
Why did they do that?
Uncle insisted that all members
of the family must participate ...
...in all the functions. they are
going to have some rituals too.
Anyway, let's see...
Where is Ganga?
Sunny, where is Ganga?
Where's Ganga, l say?
Come, let's look.
l didn't do anything...
Listen to me...
lt was she...
Leave me...
Listen to me...
Listen to me... l didn't do
anything. - Don't talk
Nakulan, leave him... Go
and see Ganga. Go...
l didn't do anything.
She only...
l know, don't worry...
Come...
l had thought of telling you
earlier, there are a lot of things.
...you need to know. You have to
be very patient and listen to me.
The psychic patient who is trying
to kill Alli, set Ganga's sari ...
...on fire is not Sreedevi... That
patient is your wife Ganga.
The day l came here, l knew that
there was nothing wrong with...
...Sreedevi. When her illness
was being projected, the real...
...patient was being hidden
l could not guess as to who it
was.
Under those circumstances, l
visited the Southern room with...
...Ganga. There l received a
psychic vibration from her.
Painfully, l realised that the
patient, l was looking out for...
...in Maadampally was Ganga.
From where and when did this
illness come to Ganga?
To test if it was as
a result of jealousy...
...l asked you to take Sreedevi to
the temple.
But Ganga was not at all
affected by it.
Then l tried to instigate her by
telling her Nagavalli's tale.
When l disagreed with her about
Nagavalli's anklets,she retaliated
...strongly. l was unusually
surprised to see the signs of her
...illness in her eyes strangely
glowing in her eyes.
At that moment. she has changed
like Nagavalli.
At sometimes, Ganga was
changing as Nagavalli.
We hear in the newspapers that
a eleven year old Muslim girl
..behaves like a twenty-one year
old brahmin woman and recites
...slokas. Old timers will say
that a spirit has entered her.
ln psychiatry, split personality,
dual personality are the minor...
...illness which later leads to
this kind of mental illness.
lf she is not treated now the
other person in her, Nagavalli...
...will surface. ln this state of
illness, she has great strength.
The woman Nagavalli, who
wakes up next to you...
... at night knows how deep
asleep you are and ...
...when you will wake up. During
the day she is with you and ...
...without your knowledge burns
up things.
At night, she who has...
...never learnt to dance sings
Tamil songs and dances.
But she is not aware, that she
is doing all this.
To know the depth of her illness
l went to the southern room.
There l spoke to her as her
psychic self.
The language was Tamil. There it
started with Neurosis and went..
...on to become Psychosis. She
was in a very murderous state.
To do something, l had to know
about her childhood.
l & Chandu went to the village
of Yevur where she had spent...
...her childhood. There she had
heard old stories from her...
...grandma, as a little girl. At
the age of three, her parents...
...left her with her grandmother
and went to pursue their jobs in
...Kolkata. She would sit everyday
on the door-step waiting for...
...her parents. But they never
came.
The year she was in Class ten, it
was predicted that she would...
...get a merit and top the exams.
Then she received a letter from
her parents.
They were going to get her
admitted to a good ...
...college in Kolkata. She was
shattered.
She stopped studying and would
pace restlessly up and down.
The sister recalled how on the
day of her first exam, she tore...
...her paper and threw it and ran
like a mad woman.
That was the first instance of
psychotic behavior.
She sat with her grandmother
when her parents came to take...
...her away. They took her to
Kolkata where she may have...
...been treated by a doctor. She
soon forgot her past and ...
...became a part of Kolkata city.
Yet, there was a possibility of...
...another psychic disorder hidden
in her.
Then she got married. From your
mother she heard of this village..
...and its tales. When she came
here with you, she heard all the
...superstitious stories here. At
first she sympathised and then...
...empathised with the character
of Nagavalli.
Her personality took the form of
Nagavalli.
She was completely changing into
Nagavalli mentally.
That has to be treated.
For that, she should never know
that she is a patient.
Besides the three of us there is
one other person who knows...
...of all this, which is Sreedevi.
Once when Ganga's illness
was threatened to be...
...revealed, l put Sreedevi in the
room and locked it.
Then when l requested her, she
agreed to act like a mad woman...
...for you and your wife's sake
a thousand times, if needed.
Just open this door. Who has
locked it?
This is the dress l had taken off
after coming from the temple.
lt's all torn and tattered.
lt must have been Sreedevi.
Who else but her?
How was the dance program
yesterday?
l didn't see all of it. l can't
recollect when l felt sleepy and
...came back home. Why, it's
Mahadevan  When did you come?
Some time back.
That's fine. How come you didn't
tell me, Nakulettan?
Wait, l'll get some coffee.
What's this, what's all this?
What are you doing?
Cool down...
Come here for a minute.
The house you are currently
staying at, was once the ...
...house in which Ramanathan,
the dancer stayed.
When the dormant character in
Ganga, Nagavalli is awakened,...
...you assume the place of
Ramanathan for her.
Nakulan becomes the cruel
Noble-man.
The rape-incident which you saw
last night, was the drama
..enacted by the patient in Ganga.
lt was meant to look as if ...
...you were trying to rape Ganga, and
your marriage with Alli would...
...not be possible. She would then
get you, that is Ramanathan back
This is how all the unnatural
things that have happened...
...and are still happening have a
reason and meaning.
All these are the strong codes
which the patient in Ganga...
...has picked up, but these
codes will never leave Ganga.
What does it mean?
Tonight Ganga's personality will
change to that of Nagavalli's ...
...forever, that means as a total
mad person.
Ganga will never be able to
come back.
To come back from that illness
there are just two ways.
Nakulan will be killed any minute,
and Ganga will commit suicide.
l want to save Nakulan atleast.
-And Ganga?
lf l have to save Ganga, l'll
have to sacrifice Nakulan.
lf l save Nakulan, Ganga will
commit suicide.
One death cannot be avoided.
We'll have to erase at least one
of them from our memory.
Unless some miracle occurs.
Greetings
-Greetings...
Come, l wanted to tell you a
very important matter.
l was feeling very restless, till
l could tell you.
Let's sit to the northern side.
Sit.- So how has the festival in
the family temple progressed?
There have been no interruptions.
Everything has gone on well.
lt will get over tomorrow.
How about all the rites l have
asked you to do?
All those have been done
properly.
That's very good.l happened to
consider your daughter's ...
...horoscope in detail. There is a
certain problem there.
She might have some mental
worries.
When l saw the position of the
ancestral house l was shocked.
There is a great possibility of a
untimely death here.
lt's not just that, in fact it has
already occurred.
You don't panic. By God's grace
lt might pass off peacefully.
l feel, l have seen you
somewhere.
l can't recollect. Who's this?
- He is...
l've forgotten where... l can't get
it... Tetroit... or...
You have forgotten, head priest.
We met in America.
Sunny... why lt's you
You cheated me.
How can l forget you    l never
imagined, l'd see you here.
lt's a great surprise, you rascal.
You've put on weight.
When he was around why did
you come and meet me with ...
...your daughter's problems. l
think, you don't know him well.
He is world famous. A wizard.
The famous psychiatry teacher...
Bradley was his Professor. When
he wanted to declare a paper ...
...on Para-psychology he invited
me to America, at Delhi.
He was Bradley's junior then. Did
you know, two world famous ...
...thesis on modern Psychology
have been written by him.
There's something l want to
speak to you in private.
Okay, l'll be here today.
We will only talk
Keep two chairs outside.
l have heard of many states of
Psychosis, but it's the first time
...l am hearing something this
serious.
So this girl's husband is still
living with her. - Yes
Since he is your close friend
can't you tell him to stay away.
l assume that Ganga will be in
her senses for another 20 hours.
At least let them be together till
then.
What are you intending? You tell
him everything clearly.
Let him save himself.
No, there are still some more
hours.
From my experience and love for
you, let me tell you that it's incurable.
l consider you as one of my
teachers who have studied the...
...human mind. But l have to
surpass all that l have learnt.
l will travel the paths not tried
by any other psychiatrist.
For the sake of Nakulan and his
wife.
l am going to break all
conventional concepts of psychiatry
All right. l won't discourage you.
l am fully satisfied. You try.
What is the way?
There are many ways to
treating Ganga.
They will all lead to the regular
outcome. l am not needed for it.
Ganga has heard stories
of ghosts in her childhood.
There are stains of that which l
have to wipe out.
l need your help for that. Then
the atmosphere that you will...
...create for me. A world of
rituals.
You be assured. l'll back you.
l have to start from a very
dangerous time frame.
Don't oppose me. Before tonight
Ganga will realise, she is sick.
l am going to let her know it
now.
You are afraid. l know. After
that she won't live for long.
She might die. But l've decided
that she should know that ...
...she is a sick person through
her husband.
lf she survives that moment, l
will have a path to follow.
ln front of me. l can follow that
path. You pray for me. Bless me.
Ganga is getting ready to buy
ornaments for Alli.
You have to go and tell her not
to go.
l have never stopped her from
anything till today.
Then you must, today. Without
any pity, tell her not to go.
Even if she resists you don't
give in.
lf you notice any unnatural
change in her, don't panic.
You must use all your love and
call her back. Go, now. Go...
Where are you going?
Didn't l tell you, we are going to
get ornaments for Alli's marriage
You don't go now.
-l shouldn't go.- No.
l had told you in the morning.
Then why this sudden change...
...of mind.
-You don't go now, Ganga.
So, what if l too went to get
ornaments for Alli?
l told you that
you should not go.
Why should l not go?
-Don't go.
Won't you allow me  ...
Won't you allow me  ...
So you won't let me go anywhere
from here.
You rogue, How dare you come
and stand before me even now?
Today is Durgashtami. l will kill
you and drink your blood & dance
Ganga...
What did l just say? What did i
say? What did l say...
No, nothing... you said nothing.
-No, l said something
What's wrong with me? What's
happened to me?
There's nothing wrong with you.
No, there is. There is something
wrong with me.
There's nothing wrong with you,
you don't cry.
Please don't hate me...
You don't hate me...- Never,
ever, my love...
What do you want?
Can l sleep?
Sunny, what are you planning to
do to my Ganga?
Are you placing her in the hands
of those Tantrics?
l won't let you.
l will never allow that.
You listen to me.
No. You don't speak a word.
l saw her. l will take her.
Somewhere else. l won't give her
in your hands.
Listen to me.
You don't say anything. lt's not
possible.
Listen to me.
No, leave me. Leave me, l say.
She doesn't need your treatment.
Go,go wherever you want to. But
before you go, let me tell you.
No psychiatrist in this world can
give her back to you.
l can also do what any
psychiatrist can.
l can even give you a new
Ganga.
But she will be just a stone
image of your Ganga.
ls that enough for you?
l want to give you back Ganga
as we know her, full of life.
But for that you have to give me
one more night, please.
Just this one night, please.
You take as many nights as you
please. l just want her back.
l am going to do an experiment.
Ganga might trouble you.
She might attack you, scratch
you, try to kill you.
She might make permanent
wounds in your heart.
Let anything happen to me. Let
her do anything to me.
lf she will kill me, let her. But
you must give her back to me.
Give her back, Sunny
-l'll give you... l'll give you...
Nagavalli that is Ganga has to be
taken to that ritual site.
Only Mahadevan can do that.
Come once and see me...
Come once and see me...
Did you come once to see me?
Did you understand my mind and
remove my sorrow?
Did you embrace me with love,
my beloved...
l take your name every day.
Even though l know your heart,
l search for you.
Did you come and see me once?
Did you come and see me once?
The girl in your heart is dancing
My lotus eyes are dancing
in my youth.
My curse has grown into
the fiery love.
Many years of my penance
has grown into fire of anger.
l got up... to break all
the obstacles in my way.
When this heart is waiting for
you for ages...
...Can't you come and see me
once?
Did you come and see me once?
Did you come and see me once?
Did you recognize my mind?
l won't leave you. Let me go.
Leave me.
l want to kill him. Leave me.
You cruel man
Leave me...
Let me go, l want to kill him.
Leave me...
Who is he?
-l won't say.
Who are you?
-l won't say.
Won't you say it?
-l won't say.
l am Nagavalli.
Sit there. -No..
-Go sit on the seat.
Sit down there.
Why have you come?
To kill.
-Whom?
To kill him.
Today is Durgashtami. l want to
kill him and drink his blood.
l'll help you to kill him.
After you kill him and you are
avenged will you leave this body.
Yes...
-Promise?
Promise, promise...
Bring him here.
Leave me.
Leave me, Leave me, l am going
to kill you and drink your blood
Today is Durgashtami, l am going
to kill you, and drink your blood.
l am going to fulfill my revenge.
Leave me.
l have to kill him.
Here... kill him
Leave me.
You are hearing my voice in this
subconscious mind.
The mind you can hear is yours,
Ganga.
You are Ganga.
You are Ganga.
ln three seconds, you will return
to your conscious mind.
Relax...
Tell me, who are you?
Tell me properly.
l am Ganga.
-Tell me again.
You are now very happy.
Very, very happy.
Yes...-You have to realise that
now you are free of your illness.
l understand. You are now going
to wake up. Carefully wake up.
Do you know who we all are?
Why do you ask me that, Sunny?
You had an illness, a wonderful
illness.
l have pulled it out from its
roots.
You will never again have it.
That's my word.
l know, l trust you.
Thank you, Sunny.
You might want to know all
that happened.
ln one of your private moments
when the two of you are alone...
...Nakulan will tell you
all like a story.
For a Ganga who likes hearing
stories.
He need not tell me. l know it
all.
l have a lot of people to thank
like sister Sreedevi, but...
...most of all my Nakulettan whom
l can never repay even if l take...
...many births for loving
me so much
Did you hear this Ganga you
loved and who loves you a lot...
...and so full of life. l am giving
her back to you. Take her.
Catch her...
You two are fortunate. No other
couple in this world have ...
...understood each other in so
much depth. This is the truth.
Now you can go to the Southern
room as much as you want...
...or see anything. l still have
some work left.-What is it?
lt's difficult to stay with a
mad man.
lt's even more difficult to live
with one who treats madness.
lf you are ready to bear the
trouble, shall l send my mother here.
We Christians don't have any
problems with horoscopes.
Listen, l'll send mother...
Where are you all going?
l want to change as fast as
possible for his sake.
For that Kolkata is more suitable.
So we are going now.
Even l want to come.
You better come fast.
Chandu, this one too.
See you, Uncle.
When will the master return,
l wonder?
Don't be so restless. The tamil
lady is now gone.
The old noble-man is still
around. Be careful.
Now there's nothing to fear.
Even if the noble-man stays here
permanently we are happy.
Vessel...
How are you now. No more
jumping on water? Let me see.
Put out your tongue.
Oh  it was this. l'll fix it.
The problem was here.
l felt as if a bird flew from
here.
Now you can step on water.
And how about a bath?
-Yes, you can take bath.
Then there is no problem with
me now.-No.
That means the illness is now
gone.
lt wasn't an illness.
Just a state of mind.
We call it ''lmacus canofia
Tagadi''.
Oh, so that's what it was. l
knew that.
Okay, see you then.
-Ok..
Okay, bye.
No, don't. l like something. l've
told that to a person l like here.
When you know of it, you must
agree and bless me... Bye.
Just stop. Stop ... So did
Sreedevi's madness go away.
Actually it was not Sreedevi who
was mad.-Then who?
When hopefully you stand
at the doorstep...
The branch of the mango tree is
full of blooms...
My heart's mango tree branch
is blossoming
