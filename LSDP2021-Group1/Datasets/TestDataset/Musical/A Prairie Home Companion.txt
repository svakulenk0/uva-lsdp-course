Market reports today...
barrows and gilts at 220 to 260 pounds

Sows are steady.
Goin' over to the feeder cattle,
beef steers, $120 to $150...
The way I like to do it...
is I take one can
of cream of mushroom soup...
and then one package of egg noodles.
I like the egg noodles
better than the Italian ones.
I like to put...
If we look at what the Lord said
in the book of Revelation...
you can be sure
that there's a price to pay...
for the way of the flesh
and that price will be paid if you don't...
Here's the wind-up and the pitch.
And it's two and two, two and two...
Before you just say,
"Honey, I think we have to have...
"some couple's counseling.
I mean, I think we have a problem.
"I can't leave a cup here for... "
All right. It's time for traffic on the fives...
and let's find out
what's going on with your drive.
Let's go to Chopper.
Chopper, what's happening?
All right, Lettie.
We got a fifteen-minute, uh, wait-494.
There's an accident working
at the spaghetti junction.
at 630, but it still
will make a very slow go...
A quiet night in a city that knows
how to keep its secrets.
But one man is still looking for
the answers to life's persistent questions.
That's me.
Or it used to be.
It was a rainy Saturday night in St. Paul...
and I had just finished off
a grilled cheese sandwich...
with beans for a chaser...
and it was time to head
for work across the street.
I'm a private eye.
Noir's the name.
Guy Noir.
But I'd taken temporary employment
about six years before...
doing security for a radio show
called A Prairie Home Companion...
on account of a serious
cash-flow problem...
due to a lack of missing heiresses
and dead tycoons lying in the solarium...
with lipstick stains
on their smoking jackets.
In other words, I was broke.
This radio show was done
out of an old theater called the Fitzgerald...
and it had been on the air
since Jesus was in the third grade.
But it was still pulling in
a few hundred people on Saturday nights.
It was a live radio variety show,
the kind that died fifty years ago...
but somebody forgot to tell them
until this night.
A big corporation down in Texas
had bought up the radio station...
and their axeman,
a guy named Cruett...
was on his way to St. Paul
to shut the thing down...
and turn the theater
into a parking lot.
It was curtains and everybody knew it,
but nobody said so.
They were Midwesterners.
They felt like if you ignored bad news,
it might go away.
Not my philosophy,
but I'm not from here.
Stay on the edge of the crowd.
Keep your eyes open.
That's my motto.
It was my last night
of gainful employment...
and I had a feeling
it was maybe going to be interesting.

Just like us, only famous.
Now, how long you been doin' this?
Doin' what?
Puttin' my pants on?
How long you been doin' radio?
Oh.
I don't know.
Thirty-some years, I guess.
Started out in Mark Twain Days,
Mississippi River...
and they hired me to play Huck Finn.
I was running a raft
on the Mississippi...
and carrying people across, and, uh...
it ran into the wake of a steamboat.
Mr. Keillor?
We need you on stage.
Fine. I'm right there.
Is this the story about the guy
who ends up hangin' from a kite...
bein' pulled by a boat
with his shorts around his ankles?
No. No, it's a different story
about a pontoon boat.
Oh! Look at this old house.
Good-bye, old house.
Good-bye, old porch.
Good-bye, old Guy.
Hey, Guy. What are they gonna do
with this house, you think? Huh?
I figure it had somethin' to do...
with the dumpster
that showed up yesterday.
Oh, my God.
Honey, listen.
I brought you that cute little dress-
I already told you,
I don't like the dress.
At least try it on.
I want to see it on you.
You try it on.
I don't want to try it on.
It's ugly.
It's the color of vomit.
Oh, sorry.
Old man Soderberg was
one of those people who was on that raft...
and, uh, he went over the rail
and into the river...
and I went in for him
'cause he couldn't swim.
So, I pulled him out.
You saved his life?
Well, not really.
The river was shallow at that point...
but he didn't know that
'cause I had hold of his ankles.
I was towing him into shore.
Hey! It's good to see ya!
Four minutes from broadcast, please.
Four minutes.
Ooh! Hey.
Hey.
Wait a minute.
Where's my bag?
No, no. The bag's here.
I brought it in.
Mom, just look.
Here it is.
Come on, Yolanda.
I swear to God I'm all,
you know, verklempt.
Ha ha ha ha!
Ohh.

Yeah. See? Plenty of time.
So he gave you the job at WLT.
Well, his brother did, actually.
Yeah, Art Soderberg.
G.K. to the stage, please.
Art Soderberg gave you the job.
Yeah, it was a-
It was
the early morning show, right?
Rise and Shine Show.
Wilmer Scott, 5 A.M.
Me and Dusty used to have
an early mornin' show.
Is that right?
Excuse me, partner.
Oh, yeah.
Breakfast at the Bunkhouse.
TV show.
And, uh, it showed mostly...
cartoons and stuff.
Remember that?
- Oh, yeah?
- For the kids.
Well, this was-uh, this came on
at 5:00 in the morning.
And it was-uh, like a gospel show.
- Inspirational show.
- Inspirational show.
Wilmer Scott was the host of it.
Wasn't Wilmer Scott the famous aviator?
No.
Yeah. First man to fly the length
of the Mississippi solo.
- No.
- I don't think so.
Right.
That was his brother Wilbur Scott.
We're now at three minutes...
Flew from New Orleans to Memphis...
all the way up to Minnesota
to Lake Itasca.
And when he got up there,
he tried to fire a signal rocket...
out the cockpit window,
but it was closed.
He became the first civilian pilot
to shoot himself down.
- Ugh!
- No. That was Wilbur.
- You made that story up.
- Right.
No, I'm talking
about Wilmer Scott.
Crashed into the lake
at his moment of triumph.
- No.
- Wilmer.
- Wilmer. Yeah. He was the host...
- No. This was the-
- Right.
- The Rise and Shine Show.
Mr. Keillor, Al's on the verge
of a coronary up there.
Yeah. I'm there.
Now, how did he have time
to fly and do radio?
G.K., sit down.
I gotta do your makeup.
You're thinking of Wilbur Scott, see?
Yeah. It's not the same person.
Not the same person.
- Yeah...
- He was dead.
You know, we used
to have a dog in the act...
when Wanda and Connie were in it...
- and that dog would sing-
- Ooo!
- Ha ha!
- Ha ha ha ha!
We'd sing this old song
and he would howl! Ha ha ha!
Oh, my God, that was a dog.
- I been thinkin' about him all day long.
- Yeah.
Rusty always comes to my mind.
Does it?

I'm sorry.
They just wouldn't pay attention.
- I had to think of something...
- I'm going to work.
- Oh!
- Didn't mean to scare you, Donna.
Wilmer Scott.
- Let's go.
- Garrison!
Wilmer Scott was the one
who hypnotized the chickens...
- There you go.
- on the show.
He did like, what,
four of those chickens in a row.
- Four or five of them.
- Who was Wilmer Scott?
He was the host of that
Rise and Shine Show.
Early in the morning. 5 A.M.
That's, uh, what, uh,
G.K. got started in radio.
Right. Gospel show.
And he hypnotized chickens
on the radio?
No, but he did
the chickens on this show.
On this show?
OK.
All right, let's dim the house lights.
You remember when
he did those chickens?
- Hypnotized them?
- Yep.
Chinese chickens, right?
Kung Pao, I believe.
With the little-didn't they have a little-
Here we go. Over here.
Piscacadawadaquoddymoggin.
Pisca what?
The sponsor. 5 A.M.
Rise and Shine Show.
What was it called?
Made of buffalo grass-
And thirty seconds to broadcast, please.
Sassafras, and natural grain alcohol.
What was it called?
Piscacadawadaquoddymoggin.
No, it's
Piscacadawadaquoddymoggin.
- Places, please.
- OK. Places.
That's what I said.
Remember the jingle?
How it went?
§ Piscacadawadaquoddymoggin

Here we go.
It was what Wilmer Scott
had in his coffee cup-
- Uh-huh.
- every morning.
- 5 A.M.
- Right here.
Then he quit drinking.
- Uh-huh. OK.
- And he lost interest in radio.
Check your barn doors.
He developed mic fright.
How did he quit drinkin'?
He just quit.
- And we're on.
- Then he raised chickens.
Show chickens.
Chinese chickens.

§ Honey, could we ask for more? §
Hello, everybody,
on a Saturday night...
and welcome to a live broadcast...
of A Prairie Home Companion
coming to you...
from WLT,
your friendly neighbor station.
Noir, where you been?
I was lookin' after the Johnson Girls.
OK. Aren't you supposed
to be guarding the door?
Are you worried about something?
Uh, I had a weird call
from some crazy lady, so-
Oh, she's not that crazy.
How do you know?
Because I met her
earlier this afternoon.
She came by.
What does she look like?
You get a description?
Yeah, I got a description.
Yeah?
She was beautiful.
Her hair was what God had in mind
when he said, let there be-
Hair. Right. Hair.
Hair. Yeah.
She gave me a smile so sweet...
you could've poured it
on your pancakes.
She was wearing a white
trench coat so white...
that rain would be
embarrassed to fall on it.
Got it. Right.
The skirt she was
wearing was so tight...
you could read
the embroidery on her underwear.
It said, "Wash in lukewarm water
and spin lightly. "
OK, you're makin' it up.
She had a Mount Rushmore t-shirt on,
and those guys never looked so good.
Especially Jefferson and Lincoln.
Right.
Kind of bloated but happy.
- If you know what I mean.
- Yeah.
It was an honor just to sit there
and inhale the same air...
that she had so recently exhaled...
just to exchange the atmosphere
between us, so to speak.
Look, what did she want?
Did she say anything about-
Who?
The lady.
Oh. She was looking for
the Presbyterian Church.
Like a dope,
I told her where it was.
And out of my life she went, just as...
quickly and erotically
as she had entered it.
Are you tired
of your current herring?
Has it lost that certain
something that you expect...
in a pickled fish product?
If so, maybe it's time you try Jens Jenson.
It's the Lake Superior herring that's made
the old-fashioned Norwegian way.
C- can someone turn it down, please?
Please?
§ Yeah, Jenson Herring is the best §
Oh, Jens Jenson's.
- Please.
- Ask for it by name.
And if your grocer doesn't stock it,
ask him why not.
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna color my hair
strawberry blonde.
Hey.
I swear to God, I should
have done it years ago.
I should have broke loose...
gone to Chicago
when Mama died back then.
That's what I should have done.
You know, you put those things off.
You seldom get around to them again.
Hmm. What are you writin'?
Poem.
Oh, a poem.
What's it about?
Heh. Suicide.
Oh, my God.
Oh. OK.
Well, you know what my philosophy is.
Yes, I do, so don't tell me.
I think that you gotta be grateful
for everything that happens to you...
because that's what
got you here, you know?
And if you hadn't gone through
all the things that you went through...
why, you know,
you wouldn't have wound up...
where you are now, so,
I don't know.
Disappointment doesn't
get you anywhere.
Anywhere.
Aren't you wonderful?
Well, one door closes
and another one opens...
then, you know, everything is
a step along the way...
and it all leads to something else.
Pardon me if I don't
get down on my knees.
Well, that's what I think.
Ahem. Read me some of your poem.
It's not finished.
Huh?
OK.
"Soliloquy for a Blue Guitar.
"Death is easy...
"like jumping into the big, blue air...
"and waving hello to God.
"God is love...
"but he doesn't necessarily
drop everything...
"to catch you, does he?
"So, when you hook the hose up
to your tailpipe...
"don't expect to wake up
and get toast for breakfast.
"The toast is you. "
Hey, what was
the name of that song?
Well, did you like it?
I won't be loanin' you my car
any time soon.
Hose to the tailpipe.
Thank you so much.
I want to come in here
and sing a song for you...
Send this out to all the friends
in my little hometown...
up north of here up on the river.

What can I do for you?
Really nothing.
I'll take care of it.
§ Playing a note... §
You have a nice show here, Mr. Noir.
Thanks. We like it.
Do you believe in the fullness of time
and the spirit?
Most people don't, you know.
It would be good, Mr. Noir,
if you would open your heart...
to the fullness of time and the spirit...
which upholds and sustains us all
through this world. Amen.
Whatever you say.

And the next week, we're back
doin' the county fair circuit...
changin' our petticoats
in the ladies' toilet...
and the boys tryin' to peek in.
Ha ha ha!
That was the only
good part about it.
Then you have to go outdoors
and sing in the open air...
with a cloud of mosquitoes
around your head.
Remember that time-
honestly, Lola, honest to God-
a dragonfly flew right in my mouth.
Oh, yeah!
It was this big.
I thought it was a bird.
How old were you then?
I was thirteen.
Your mother was ten.
Wanda was what?
Wanda was sixteen.
Connie, fifteen.
Yep.
That was the end of it.
The end of the road.
That was a great-
You know, Wanda took it
real hard, didn't she?
A week later, she got arrested.
For what?
You never told me this.
Shoplifting, and I did tell you this.
Mom, you're going senile.
You didn't tell me that.
No...
She was havin'
a cup of coffee in the cafe.
She ordered a glazed doughnut.
She started eatin' it
and she got a sugar rush.
She was diagnosed hypoglycemic.
And so, she forgets
she didn't pay for the doughnut...
and she walks out the door.
- It wasn't two minutes-
- But they arrested her for shopliftin'.
The red lights are flashin'
and she's in handcuffs...
- And they had a policeman there.
- And the cameras, the TV camera-
- the station came right down.
- It was on the news.
And her hair is, like, stickin' out like this
and she's bawlin'...
and Daddy sees it
on the 10:00 newscast.
'Cause he was
in the hospital with Mama.
She was havin' her tubes tied
after Johnny was born.
Thank you.
- Didn't need to know that.
- Well.
Daddy sees Wanda gettin' arrested
on TV for shoplifting.
He has a major coronary occlusion.
Yeah.
He just climbed up into
the hospital bed with Mama...
then he pulled the sheet
up over his own face...
and when the nurse came in,
he was dead.
That was it.
You know?
He left a note, 'cause Wanda got
released from jail just for the funeral.
He said, "Wanda, you broke my heart.
Signed, Daddy. "
She did thirty days
for one glazed doughnut.
A 59-cent doughnut.
If it had been rock and roll...
she could have
thrown sofas out of the window-
hotel window.
No, not even her own sofa.
She could throw somebody else's sofa
out the window.
You don't know what kind
of passersby at the bottom.
She could have been hittin' people.
It wouldn't have mattered.
But when you're playin' to
Christian family audiences like we were...
you so much as forget to pay
for a damn doughnut...
they throw you out like
a piece of garbage.
Sooner kill you than look at you.
Some of those good people, eh?
The Soderberg family selling out!
I just do not get it.
I mean, they've owned WLT...
since they ran it
out of a sandwich shop.
I mean, that's what the call letters
stand for, you know.
"With Lettuce and Tomato. "
Did you know that?
I mean, how do you just walk away
from somethin' like that?
I mean, what are we?
Used Kleenex?
They got old, babe.
They started thinking
about ease and comfort.
Then, I figure, they saw a brochure
about an island with palm trees...
and an azure sky
and miles of sand...
and they thought, "Hey! Ha ha!
"We don't have to suffer through
these miserable Minnesota winters.
"We don't have to freeze our butts off
waiting for our bus to come.
"Our bus has come. It's here.
We'll leave the business to the kids...
"and we'll head for paradise
and to hell with it. "
Only trouble is...
the kids had already gone down
to paradise ahead of them.
So then, a big corporation
down in Texas...
offered them
a gazillion dollars for it.
Texans.
Sure.
They talk funny
and their eyes don't focus...
and their flesh is rotting
and falling off...
but hey. You know. So what?
Yeah, nobody's perfect and, uh...
money is money...
so, the Soderbergs took the dough.
End of story.
Do you have any tweezers?
Egg salad or ham salad?
Why are you crying?
Well, it's the last show.
I'm never going to see
these people again.
You'll see them again.
I knew all of them from the old days.
Soupy and Red, Ray.
And Helen.
Gone and forgotten.
Every sparrow is remembered.
I don't even know if they're gonna
make a speech or anything.
It doesn't seem right, does it?
No.
Some big company come in
and steps on us...
like we were bugs at the picnic.
What's in ham salad?
I- I can't remember the word. It was...
May I...
Maybe...
Mayo?
Mayonnaise.
Well, it's an end of an era
when this show goes, guys.
There won't be anything left
on the radio except what?
People yellin' at you
and computers playing music.
I mean, it's a tragedy.
I wasn't gonna tell you this...
but between you and me
and the fly on the wall...
there's a woman on the premises who
I think, maybe, is gonna save our bacon.
Hmm?
She's got that look about her.
Who is she?
I'm not sure. I'm still working
on figuring that one out.
Just close your eyes
for a second.
She from NorComm?
Time will tell.
I'll just let personal charm
and dashing good looks do their work.
She walked in,
couldn't take her eyes off me.
Drawn to me like a moth to the flame.
Every time there's
a triumph in the world...
a million souls have to be trampled on.
And right there-you can see it
right in the damn carpet.
What does that have
to do with anything?
Mama. She I-she went-
She went up to the-
It was a lot for Mama to put up with.
We had to shovel her into
the Good Shepherd Home.
That's it.
That was the sad day.
Connie quit the act.
God, we'd already lost Wanda.
Wanda was like magic.
The four of us,
when we were together...
- she was singin'.
- She was-
And next to you, I'm tellin' you...
you've followed in her footsteps.
You are the same-
the same talent.
No. I don't know about that.
So, now, it's just the two of us.
Yep. Just the two of us.
You know what?
It was your dad got us on the radio.
God, that was
a good-lookin' family!
I can understand you
goin' for that guy.
Yeah, he sang like an angel.
He sang...

would ever care to look at?
Where?
In the back.
That's where your crack is.
Well, I don't see nothin'.
- Hey, Molly.
- Don't talk to me.
Am I decent back there?
Don't ask me.
I'm not your mother.
You might be decent
if you lost 25 pounds of ugly fat.
And I might suggest
cuttin' off your head.
She showed me her tattoo once.
Hell she did.
On her shoulder.
You're lyin' through your teeth.
Left shoulder.
Right here.
- That ain't the shoulder.
- Whatever you want to call it.
I'd call it the clavicle.
OK, well, why don't you
ask her about it?
Maybe she'll let you have a look.
Well, what did it say?
It said, "Freedom. "
Fr-Now I know you're lyin'.
Come on. We gotta put out the CDs.
Come on, niece.
Hey. Molly.
Molly, here.
Take these out front.
Did you hear about the Soderbergs
sellin' the radio station?
I heard all about it.
Are you OK?
Yes, of course.
Hmm?
Kind of a bizarre feeling, isn't it?
- What?
- The silence.
What?
Well...
you're gonna say somethin' about it.
You're gonna talk
to the people, aren't you?
Say, "Thanks for listening,"
or something.
Yeah, you know.
I don't think so.
Why not?
Say, "Thank you. "
What?
I'm just not into making big speeches.
What do you do when you
leave somebody's house?
You don't just turn around-
I don't make a big speech.
A big weepy speech.
Oh, that's it!
You're afraid that you're gonna cry!
I wouldn't.
Yeah, that's right.
That's true. You wouldn't.
And you know, that's why, I think,
that our romance was so short.
Because I knew that when we broke up,
you would not cry...
so, I got way over it.
Does that make sense to you?
No, not at all.

Wouldn't this be a good time
for a piece of rhubarb pie?

please welcome one of radio's
great singing families...
the Johnson Girls,
Rhonda and Yolanda.
- Hi, everybody.
- Hi.
Oh, thank you. Thank you!
Thank you very much.
I just want to say right away
how happy I am...
that my daughter Lola
is here tonight.
- Come on, Lola.
- Oh! Thank you, sweetheart.
They want to see you.
It means a lot to me that you came.
Yeah, I named my little girl Lola
after our own mother.
Yeah, Lola was our mom.
Lola. And tonight,
we're gonna sing...
an old song that our mother loved.
Oh, it's one of her favorites.
Yep. She was our inspiration.
Some of you know this story...
but she's the main reason
that we started makin' music originally...
because you know she-
it was the only way we knew
to make her happy.
She'd be down on the kitchen floor
scrubbin' on her knees.
But if you stood in the doorway
and you sang a song that she liked...
why, she would just look up and smile.
Ha ha!
Worn out as she was...
it was a smile as wide
as the Mississippi. Heh heh.
Down at the mouth.
Not so slow, you sons of bitches.
I'll break your necks.
- Yeah.
- I mean it.
And you could see her gold tooth.

Let's bring out Mr. Chuck Akers here...
Mr. Chuck Akers, come out here
and give us a song.
The sweet singer of Kandiyohi County...
the heartthrob
of mature women everywhere.
My good friend, Mr. Chuck Akers.
Good to see you, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Uh, we would like to bring a song
to all of our fans.
Now, that's kind of tough to do,
'cause we're all over the place.
Take me.
Yeah, I've bounced all over.
I've done tent shows, schoolhouses,
uh, parkin' lots...
the back of trucks,
movie theaters, auditoriums.
I've even done churches.
Now, that's hard to believe, I know.
Anyway, this song is for you.
And we mean every word of it,
all right?
Sic 'em.
§ Hmm §
§ Do do do do §
§ My bark of life §

§ You've been that friend to me §
- Hey, Lola.
- Hi.
Heard you're gonna sing a song for us,
lookin' forward to that.
Oh, no. I don't-maybe.
Well, it sure would mean
the world to your mom.
She always said you had talent.
Yeah, I don't-I don't really know
any of their songs.
I only know my own songs.
Well, sing one of them then.
They're mostly about death.
Oh.
Well, lotta good songs about death.
All mine are about suicide.
Oh.
Yeah, you know, um,
hangin' yourself with an extension cord...
- carbon monoxide, overdose...
- Hey, ahem...
you know, we could do, uh,
Amazing Grace together.
Yeah?
Well, hey, look.
I'll play the guitar,
we'll sing it together...
we'll bring this house down.
You know, I don't know
if you knew this...
- about my friend Dusty here-
- Hey, hey.
But he learned to sing gospel music
in San Quentin.
And full shush.
Yes sir, that's where I met him.
I was with Johnny Cash,
singin' in prisons.
Shut the pie hole.
There were all these
heinous, depraved criminals...
- And well-
- Liar, liar. Whatever, moron.
and it almost made you forget
what he'd done.
Which I don't wanna talk about.
You know, you are so dumb,
you may be twins.
He made me promise on a Bible
that I would never tell, and I won't.
So let that be the end of it.
Let me just say this, though.
Watch out for hugs.
Heh!
Right.

Robin and Linda Williams.
Let's come in here now
with a word about ketchup.
Yes, ketchup, made from tomatoes
that contain natural sunshine...
which we need in this part
of the country.
We are not a sunshiny people.
We're not a paradise people
or a beach people.
We are dark people.
People who believed it could be worse.
And we're waiting
for it to become worse.
We come from people
who brought us up to believe...
that life is a struggle...
and if you should
ever feel really happy...
be patient. This will pass.
- Ha ha ha.
- So we could...
When do you guys go on?
As soon as ol' spud butt here
shuts his yapper.
Thanks for the encouragement.
Hey, you are gonna be great.
Give me a hug.
All right, guys.
More show in just a moment...
but let's come in here now
with a word about shoes!
That's Guy's Shoes. Boys...
§ Talkin' shoes §
§ Talkin' Guy's §
§ Any two, any size §
§ From your ankles to your toes §
§ At the bottom of your clothes §
§ You're talkin' shoes §
§ Talkin' Guy's §
Yes, Guy's Shoes.
They're made to last.
Ask about those Guy's Cash Shoes,
with the hole in the soles...
so you stash your cash
when you're out on the trail.
Isn't that right, Lefty?
That's where I keep mine, G.K.
All right.
Let's welcome 'em now...
the old trail hands here...
the Pachelbels of the prairie,
the Brahmses of the bunkhouse...
here they are,
Dusty and Lefty.
- Good to have you with us.
- Well, thank you, Garrison.
Yes sir, it's good to be back on the show...
because, you know, it gets
mighty lonesome out there on the prairie.
And a cowboy gets
tired of scenery after a while.
You get, well,
sceneried out, and uh...
sort of wish you had
somebody to talk to.
Somebody smart.
- Hmm.
- Ha ha ha.
So you're lonesome for people, huh?
Well, you know, it's true, Garrison.
And, uh, it-it ain't the same
just talkin' to your horse.
My horse is extremely smart.
Uh, he knows math.
He knows physics and chemistry...
but I can't seem
to teach him philosophy.
Can't teach him philosophy, eh?
Well, no. You can't put Descartes
before the horse.
- Aw...
- Ha ha ha.
That was a good one, you know?
Well, what do you reckon
we sing a song, Dusty?
Well, let's do it, Lefty.
One, two, you know what to do.
§ I'm just an old cowboy §
§ With twigs in my hair §
§ Two-thirds alligator §
§ And three-quarters bear §
§ And one half a lion §
§ But let it be known §
§ I never told one lie §
§ That was not my own §
§ Whoopi-ti-yi-yo §
§ Get along, little dogie §
§ I eat when I'm hungry §
§ I'll drink when I'm dry §
§ Don't boss me or cross me §
§ Or I'll spit in your eye §
§ I think what I please §
§ And I say what I mean §
§ And I think all you women §
§ Are the finest I've seen §
§ Whoopi-ti-yi-yo... §
So my mom said, um...
my mom said, you got into radio...
uh, when someone was flying a kite
whose clothes came off? Ha.
A naked man flying.
Quite a sight.
Why didn't he pull his shorts up?
He was hanging on to the kite,
couldn't let go.
- He was up high.
- Ha.
A hundred feet up in the air...
fifty.
Ha.
So, how did that get you into radio?
Well, that was how I met your dad.
Here comes the solo.
Yeah, real good.
Real good.
- Wait, naked guy...
- Yeah?
- Was my dad?
- Right.
Ha.
Naked man with red swim trunks
around his ankles.
Couple thousand people saw it...
so we figured it was a good time
to leave town...
so we got a car,
and we headed down to Chicago.
§ We ride in the snow §
§ And we ride in the rain §
§ Just like Gene Autry §
§ Just like John Wayne §
§ They were better cowboys §
§ Than us and I mean it §
§ But we are still livin' §
§ And that is convenient §
§ Huh! §
§ Pi-ti-yi-yo §
§ Get along, little dogie §
§ Huh! §
§ Pi-ti-yi-yo §
§ Get along, little dogies §
I go in to pay for the gas...
and he wakes up and decides
he needs to use the men's room.
So I come back.
I think he's still sleeping
in the back seat...
and I get behind the wheel,
and I drive to Chicago.
I leave him there in Oshkosh.
And he goes into the cafe,
and your mother was the waitress.
That's how they met.
That's how I came to be born.
Well, it kind of led to that, yeah.
Yeah, but I mean if you had
looked in the back seat...
and-and seen that he wasn't there,
I wouldn't exist.
Well, he and I weren't getting along
that well, so that's why.
That's really strange.
Well, no. I think it's one...
of the most beautiful things
I ever did not do.
So how'd you get into radio then?
Well, there was a show called, uh,
The Baked Bean Jubilee.
- Yeah, with my dad.
- With your dad, right.
- Happy Baked Beans.
- Happy Baked Beans, you know?
§ Happy Baked Beans §
§ Are nutritious §
Shh! Keep your voices down!
§ Made the natural way §
- Keep your voices down!
- § Made of natural fiber §
Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh!
§ Try some, you will say §
- There's a show going on!
- § They are nature's fruit §
§ Root-ti-toot-toot-toot §
§ Try baked beans §
§ Every day §
§ Ooh, baby §
- § You're my man §
- Mmm. Hmm!
§ Ahh, ooh, you do what- §
Let's come in here now
with some cards and letters...
from the friends
and neighbors out there.
So good to know that
you're out there listening.
Here's a little note here from Aaron...
who says our show is a source
of comfort and laughter for him.
- And he's hoping-
- And he's hopin' that the Johnson Girls-
he's goin' to hear them
shake their hips a little...
and sing Touch me,
Kiss me, Be my man.
No, he was just joking, he says.
Just joking about that.
He was hoping that we would sing, uh,
Gold Watch and Chain.
- Oh. Oh, I bet.
- Yolanda.
Yolanda and I.
So let's bring up Yolanda here.
This beautiful old song
Gold Watch and Chain. Boys.
§ Darlin', how can I stay
here without you? §
§ I have nothing
to ease my poor heart §
§ All the world would seem sad,
dear, without you §
§ Tell me now that we never will part §
§ I will pawn you
my gold watch and chain, love §
§ I will pawn you
my gold wedding ring §
§ I will pawn you this... §
- Molly?
- What?
Would you come here a moment?
What is it, Guy?
Um, I just want to...
Oh...
You are fat.
Y- you might think about cutting down
on the, um, desserts and the beer.
And also possibly sex with men.
W- when did-
when did this take place?
Who-who did this to you?
Ahh, yes, Lefty, Dusty,
are-are you boys aware of this?
O- our little girl's going
to be a-a single mom.
- You poor thing.
- Thank you.
I'll swear on a stack of Bibles
it wasn't me, darlin'.
Oh, that's great
to know, Dusty. Thanks.
§ Do not scorn her §
§ With words fierce and bitter §
§ Do not laugh
at her shame and downfall §
You should sit.
§ For a moment,
just stop and consider §
Just ignore them.
§ That a man
was the cause of it all §
Dusty!
Yo!
That reminds me.
About that obscene song
you sang last week.
- Obscene? Uh-
- Yeah.
"I'll give you my moonshine
if you show me your jugs"?
No, not that one.
"Lovin' you ain't easy,
but I hear your sister is"?
No, no, no.
"Come ride my pony all night long.
"Come ride him bareback,
I'll sing you a song. " That one.
That's just a song
about ridin' a pony.
Mmm.
Oh, what-what the hell
did you think it was about?
Let's go out with a little style, OK?
What do you say?
"Go out"?
What do you mean?
Just what I said.
"Go out?" You mean me?
All of us.
What the Sam Hill are you
talkin' about, mister?
- Ohh. Hold on.
- Hey.
Got some nice egg salad sandwiches
if you're hungry.
No gunplay backstage.
I'm hungry.
I'm always hungry.
Did you know
that she's pregnant?
§ And can't be returned §
§ You have left me
and gone to another §
§ All my hopes
and bridges are burned §
§ But I will pawn you
my gold watch and chain, love §
§ And I will pawn you
my gold wedding ring §
§ I will pawn you
this heart in my bosom §
§ Only say that you'll love me again §
Hee hee.
Thank you, Yolanda.
What a beautiful, beautiful song.
This portion of our show
is brought to you...
by Powdermilk Biscuits...
and also brought to you by duct tape.
Duct tape.
Yes, duct tape.
Duct tape.
Useful thing around the household...
almost anything that comes
up around the household.
Sometimes you need to make repairs,
doors come loose...
and windows,
all sorts of things can happen.
Sometimes you just forget something
that you're looking for...
and duct tape can come in handy.
You can wrap it around your finger
like a string or something.
You can just tape it up.
Whatever.
Things do tend to fall apart, you know.
Confusion reins endemic
in our world today.
- Just things tend to drift-
- Oh, jeez.
And especially as you get to be older...
duct tape is
the most useful thing you'll find.
All repairs are short term.
We know that.
Say a faucet should be dripping
and you, and you...
The water is falling there,
dripping onto your cupboard...
and the-and the wood
comes loose from the wall...
and you need something to fix it.
Just reach for a roll of duct tape.
That would be the-the perfect thing.
Or maybe your orangutano's
been jumpin' up and down on it.
The weight of the orangutan has,
like, you know, crushed-
uh, crushed part of the counter.
And-and then your Rottweiler...
he comes runnin' out and
he bites the orangutan in the hinder.
Gets him all riled up.
Hey.
The Rottweiler, actually,
is locked in the basement.
Sorry to correct you there, Rhonda.
I can hear them goin' at it.
- He's down locked in the basement.
- The Rottweiler and the orangutan.
A double lock there.
Because the-
uh, the orangutan, you know...
They got, uh, the fingers
and he's got a saw.
A chainsaw.
He cut a big hole in the door
and the Rottweiler got out.
That's how he bit the orangutan
in the hinder.
And then-and then
don't forget about the peacock.
And then the flock.
Uh, overhead there was...
a big helicopter
came flyin' through.
Right through a flock
of Canadian geese.
And, uh, really was gettin'
someone's goose was cooked.
And then they startled the peacock.
Yeah! Then-
And then this-this sick-
- The peacock.
- No, wait.
This sadist-this sadist in uh, sneakers
was creepin' up on everybody.
And the peacock, he-uh-
he jumps right at the orangutan.
His beak...
yeah... is flashing like a scimitar.
Yeah, but the, uh, but his aim is-
uh, goes awry and it-and then, um-
He takes that chainsaw and he throws it.
The orangutan throws it
at the peacock.
But he's got a bad aim.
The aim.
It goes right through a plate-glass window.
But it almost-
Yeah-hits the mailman.
Wow! Oh!
Murray. But doesn't.
It misses him by inches.
And by the way, he's bringin' you a letter
from your ex-girlfriend. Remember her?
Who is still furious at you
for having dumped her.
You know, just thrown her aside,
the woman who loved you.
Just because
you found somebody new.
How could you do that?
She will never understand.
And, um...
duct tape isn't gonna
help you with that one bit.
No, I suppose not, but with two out of-
And duct tape is not gonna make
an honest man out of you.
No, it won't. But with two out of three
chores around the home, duct tape.
And it isn't even gonna help you
find whatever it was...
you were lookin' for, so-
what were you lookin' for?
I was lookin' for duct tape.
Duct tape.
All repairs are temporary and short term.
It's almost just about the only thing...
that really works sometimes,
and that is duct tape.
More of A Prairie Home Companion
here in just a moment...
right after we come in
with a word about coffee.
Yes, Jearlyn,
nothing stimulates a person...
keeps you focused quite
like good old caffeine.
Black coffee.
Mmm. So good.
I'm glad you like it, too.
§ Smells so lovely when you pour it §
§ You will want to drink a quart of coffee §
§ It's delicious all alone §
§ It's also good with doughnuts §
§ Black coffee §
§ Coffee stimulates your urges §
§ It's served in Lutheran churches §
§ Keeps the Swedes and the Germans §
§ Awake through the sermons §
§ Have a pot of it today §
§ I'm sure you'll say
it's awfully good coffee §
Chuck?
I'm ready for you now.
Chuck?
§ Much too long §
Hey, you decent? Chuck?
Whoa!
Chuck, what you got
goin' in here, huh?
Huh!
Candles and music and-
Hey, hey, wake up, buddy.
Hey-Chu-
Chuck?
§ Oh, my Lord does just what he said §
§ Let the light from
the lighthouse shine on me §
§ He healed the sick
and He raised the dead §
§ Let the light from
the lighthouse shine on me §
§ Shine on §
§ Let it shine on §
§ Let the light from
the lighthouse shine on me §
§ From the lighthouse shine on me §
§ Let the light from

§ Oh, this whole world's
gonna reel and rock §
§ Let the light from

Honey? It's me.
Ready or not, here I come.
I am lookin' for a big hot dog
to put in my bun, you old dog, you.
Why you hidin' from me?
Wake up.
Wake up, sugar.
Oh!
Chuck?
Chuck! Chuck!
It's OK.
It's OK. It's OK.
But how can he be dead?
He just went away, that's all.
Oh, my Chuck.
My baby.
The death of an old man
is not a tragedy.
Oh...
I don't want him to go.
Forgive him his shortcomings
and thank him for all of his love and care.

Time to break now
for station identification.
And we'll right back
with more right after this.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are now
at nine minutes to broadcast, please.
Nine minutes.
Hey. No smokin', mister.
Chuck Akers is dead.
He's gone.
I don't follow your reasoning there.
I said Chuck is dead.
Who's dead?
Chuck.
When?
Now.
He just died now?
I don't know when the hell he died.
I wasn't there.
What was the approximate
time of death?
Recent. Why don't you go
check it out for yourself.
He's in there.
Does anyone else know about this?
I have no idea.
Because if anyone else knows about this
and they're not saying anything...
I need to know about that.
Excuse me.
I used to listen to your show...
until I died.
My name was Lois Peterson.
I was driving up to this cabin up north...
and you were telling a story
and I was laughing.
And then the car skidded off the road
and into a ditch and it flipped.
And as it did, the thought occurred to me...
that the story just wasn't that funny.
And then...
I was standing in this tall grass
looking down at my own body.
Hmm.
So sorry.
I was on my way to that cabin
to meet my lover Larry.
We had been planning it
for over two months.
And because of your story,
I lost control and I died.
- So...
- I'm so sorry.
So you killed me, in a way.
Isn't that interesting?
He's quite dead.
Just a half an hour ago
he was walkin' around...
exchangin' the gases
with the atmosphere.
Well, there's a lot more
out than in now.
We should call the cops.
No.
When the time is right,
I'll make the call.
You... just, um-
All right. We're at five minutes
from broadcast.
Don't talk about this to anyone.
All right?
Keep it under your hat.
Go about your business.
I'm gonna secure the area.
Let's get on with the show.
You gonna be all right?
Yeah, I'll be all right.
So you're really an angel?
Of course.
Hmm.
What do you do?
Well, that's a dumb question.
No, no. I-uh, I do lots of things.
I comfort people that are desperately sad.
And I make personal appearances.
I-
Tears on a statue.
One time I put the face of the Lord
on a bowl of oatmeal.
Just to cheer people up.
You know, those kind of things.
But mostly I-I take people up to see God.
That's why I'm here.
But I-I just keep thinking
about that story...
and why it was funny.
The story I told on the radio?
It was about penguins.
Oh. The penguin joke.
Two penguins standing on an ice floe.
That's the one.
And the first penguin says...
"You look like
you're wearing a tuxedo. "
And the second penguin says...
"What makes you think I'm not?"
- Is there more?
- No.
- That's the joke?
- Mm-hmm.
Why is that funny?
I guess it's funny
because people laugh at it.
I'm not laughing.
You're an angel.
G.K. to the stage, please.
G.K. to the stage, please.
I should probably go.
Oh yes, of course.
I didn't come for you.
Oh. OK. All right.
I think they're waiting for me.
Oh-what did the second penguin say?
The second penguin said,
"What makes you think I'm not?" OK?
- OK.
- All right. See you.
Take your time.
Thanks.
Two minutes from broadcast.
Two minutes, please.
Ahem. Ahem. Ahem.
Could I have a word with you?
Uh, we have a situation here,
um, which we are monitoring...
but I wanted you to be apprised of it.
You mean the woman
in the white trench coat?
No, there's a woman in a w-
a white trench coat, yes.
You saw her?
- I saw her over here.
- You spoke to her?
You-no, you were talking to her.
You saw that?
Yeah. You.
Well, if you see her in the audience,
I need you to give me a high sign.
Just use-give me a signal
with your hand.
Do, uh...
No. Here, do it behind your back.
- Just-just-just wiggle.
- Rabbit tail?
Yeah, and give me a verbal, uh, sign,
some-something in code.
Just say, uh, indemnity.
- Indemnity. Yeah.
- OK.
Or no. Granite Falls.
OK. How does that-
How does that go?
Granite Falls?
Well, you just say, uh,
then we would like to do a song now...
for our dear friends in...
Granite Falls.
OK. All right. OK.
And then if I miss that,
uh, this'll be a cue for Rich...
to do a-a musical turn.
- That's the code.
- Code?
Then I'll get it. OK?
That's how I got into radio, actually.
Morse code.
I was a deckhand on a-on a boat.
Big storm. November.
I'll never forget it.
You got on the ship radio...
and you told jokes
and you sang for two hours...
until the ship came in safely to port.
Right.
I told you that story?
Granite Falls.
- G.K.?
- Granite Falls. Right.
Yeah?
- If you see G.K. do that behind his back...
- Fifteen seconds.
it's your cue to go like this.
So what are you gonna do
for work after this?
I don't know.
I'll find a job somewhere.
Like where?
A job where I never have to say a word.
Why?
That's why. Right there.
What are you gonna do?
Like be an underwear model
or something?
If they ask, sure.
- You're on.
- Yes.
And we're back with more of
A Prairie Home Companion...
brought to you by the Federation
of Associated Organizations.
Somewhere there's an organization
just for you.
And brought to you by Fred Farrell...
the name you've gradually come
to trust...
when it comes
to animal nuisance control.
The Johnson Girls coming up...
and the old trail hands,
Dusty and Lefty are with us...
and our good friend Jearlyn Steele.
Jearlyn.

§ To get ahead of the game §
It's time for me to go.
Oh.
I am the angel Asphodel.
I come here to do my work
and bring mercy into the world...
and praise His holy name.
OK. That's fine with me.
You wanna be an angel?
I say you...
you be an angel.
You're angelic enough for me.
I say spread your wings and fly.
This is a revelation.
For the both of us.
Listen, if you're an angel, I, uh...
I wonder if...
you and me were to, uh...
you know.
Would you...
feel anything?
I would feel love.

That's my-so it doesn't ring.
That's my phone. Excuse me.
Yeah?
He's here?
OK. Thanks.
The, uh, axeman is here.
I'll take care of it.
All right.

Mr. Crust?
Cruett! I don't believe we've met.
Guy Noir.
Vice-president, Security
and, uh, Data Acquisition.
Good for you.
Show almost over?
Almost. Yes.
Just in time then.
The show's been going on how long?
Somebody said fifty years.
N- nearly. Uh, thirty... something.
Weird. It's like a time warp.
I feel like an anthropologist...
finding some primitive tribe
squatting around a fire in the forest...
telling stories,
sparks flying up in the air.
Yeah. Heh heh.
Well, we've got the, uh, luxury box
for you, right here.
Right this way.
Who's that guy?
Oh, that's the guy, uh,
used to come see the shows here.
Um, local boy.
He's a writer.
Uh, he wrote novels.
Uh, F. Scott Fitzgerald.
Grew up right here in St. Paul.
What kind of novels?
Uh, romantic ones.
- Oh.
- Mostly.
I don't read romances. No time.
Hmm. We usually have,
uh, clients in here.
You know, five or six of them
at a time, sponsors-
That's some nice plaster work
around the proscenium there.
We'll have to remember
to save a piece of that.
I wish we were taping this show.
This is a live show.
Videotape.
Historical purposes.
Send it to a museum.
Well, this is just great.
This is all I need.
This is the first time
somebody died at the show.
- I mean, the first time!
- Al, we're all gettin' older.
He's dead?!
The show's not over, is it?
We've got a dead man downstairs.
We've gotta do something.
Just be glad-glad you
don't have him onstage.
- When did this happen?
- Who's that, Chuck?
- Yes.
- Where's Evelyn?
Evelyn was down there.
He was waitin' for Evelyn
when he passed away.
He died with a heart full of hope.
Yeah, that's not a bad way to go
when you think about it.
Sittin' there in the dark,
in your underwear, you know?
Waitin' for your lover to come.
He was in his underwear?
Donna told me he was wearin'
boxer shorts with big raspberries on 'em...
and a great big bottle of massage oil
and a bayberry candle goin'...
He was all set.
He was loaded for Evelyn.
Well, uh, can I offer you
somethin' to drink?
Water. No ice. No lemon.
Water. No ice. No lemon.
Straight up. Neat.
Radio sound effects
learned from a master.
What can I tell you about the show?
I know everything I need
to know about the show.
- You're sure about that?
- Yes.
You're not gonna change your mind?
Ahh! No.
Hmm.
Lot of good people up there.
On the stage.
Lot of 'em.
I mean, I'm a man
of the world like yourself...
but, uh, these folks
put their lives into this.
Now they can put their lives
into something else.
There's always something
to put your life into, isn't there?
It's like the Scripture tells us...
you have to lose your life
before you can...
find it.
Scripture is guiding you here?
The company is owned
by people of faith, Mr. Noir.
Ahh. Before I came to the Lord,
I played in a band myself.
The Dukes of Rhythm.
Ha ha.
We were terrible.
Then, thank God, we were saved by
the simple realization of the truth.
We were no good.
We got fired.
It was a blessing.
You wanna say something?
Say what?
No, I don't want to say-
You know, you should say somethin'...
'cause he was on the show
all these years.
Absolutely.
I don't do eulogies. I don't.
Is there a reason for that?
Or you just don't care for people?
I'm at an age where
if I started to do them...
I'd do nothing but eulogies.
How about just
a moment of silence?
Silence on the radio?
I don't know how that works.
Garrison, OK, thank you.
OK, we've got about thirty seconds.
Thirty seconds.
Hold on a second.
You're saying if my mom died...
you wouldn't do anything,
you wouldn't say anything.
If I what?
You'd just ignore it,
you'd act like it never happened?
How could you do that?
We don't look back in radio.
That's the beauty of it.
Nobody gets old.
Nobody dies.
We just keep on goin'.
What if you died?
I will.
You don't want people
to remember you?
I don't want them to be told
to remember me.
Hmm?
You know what?
Somebody died down there.
That's right.
OK? And we're not
even paying attention...
and you're not even
gonna say anything?
We pay attention by doin' our job.
Go, go, go.
You're on, you're on, you're on.
I gotta get someone
to take me home.
I'm not spendin' the night
alone tonight.
Don't-nobody even cares.
No, we do.
We all care.
We care like hell.
You're gonna want to have...
a whole freezer full
of Prince of Pizzas.
It's the frozen pizza that
tastes homemade always.
Made from real Minnesota
cheese and sausage.
§ One Prince of Pizza slice §
§ Puts me in paradise §
§ Sausage and extra cheese §
§ Onions and anchovies §
That's fun-that's funny.
Watching them through this glass,
it's like a zoo.
- Ahh.
- I'll be right back.
§ It's the best §
§ It's the best §
§ In the Midwest §
§ Pizza pie §
§ Prince of Pizza is the best pie §
Yes, Guy Noir here.
Get me Molly.
Yeah?
Molly, listen, I need you to do something
for me. It's very important.
What?
I need you come out here
so I can talk to you face to face.
- Can you do that?
- I'm right here.
Wha-b-d-
- Who's this?
- I don't know.
No, who-
who's talking to me?
I don't-I-I am!
Shh! Hello?
Hello?
There's nobody there.
OK.
I have to ask you
to do something for me.
It's very important.
- It's, uh...
- What?
I need a drink.
Uhh!
Oh, je-
You OK?
Yeah.
So how's it goin' in there
with, uh, axeman?
Very slippery.
How do they keep
the drinks on there?
It's going very well.
I mean, well, he's tough.
He's tough.
But, uh, I think, uh,
I think I have another solution.
What?
Well, he used to be in a band.
A long time ago
called the Dukes of Rhythm...
and I think if we can round up
the guys who were in that band...
and get 'em all on the show...
Sorry.
Um, we can, um, we can maybe
get him to change his mind.
Have a kind of reunion, you know,
with all the, uh, band members...
right here on
The Prairie Home Companion.
Here's to happy endings.
Happy endings!
Ahh!
Oh, God, that's good.
Mother's milk.
- What?
- Sorry.
Here's what I need you to do.
- Hmm.
- Take this note-
uhh, to the woman...
backstage...
Give it to who?
The lady backstage.
The blonde lady
with a white trench coat.
Blonde lady with
a white trench coat?
Yes. She's beautiful, blonde.
Ahh, ahh...
You can't miss her.
"Angel, man in the-"
Shh!
Boat?
Booth.
"Man in the booth...
Make him go away. "
Give this to her,
and then destroy that.
It's time to bring out an old favorite
here on A Prairie Home Companion...
And that's two fine women
who've been singing together...
since they were little girls
growing up in Oshkosh, Wisconsin.
They've kept alive all those old songs
that go way back.
Please welcome here the Johnson Girls,
Rhonda and Yolanda.
Ha ha ha ha.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
We're gonna do a song now
that we wrote for our mama.
Who brought us up...
with no, uh, luxuries.
Ha ha. No vacation trips.
No vacations even.
Ha ha ha.
But we did have one luxury...
and that was... music.
You know?
Mama loved us to sing.
Yeah, no matter how tired she was,
she loved...
hearin' us kids sing.
So this is for you, Mama.
§ Good-bye to my mama §

The Johnson Girls, thank you.
Brought to you by Powdermilk Biscuits
in the big blue box.
Let's bring 'em in right now
in off that long, dusty, lonesome trail...
the old trail hands themselves,
Dusty and Lefty.
Thank you very much.
Lefty and I are very proud of this.
It's a brand new number.
And, uh, we'd like to send it out
to our friends there in, uh...
Maple Plain and-and Glenwood
and, uh, Renville and of course...
our good friends
up there on the range.
This is for you.
One... two... three.
Oh, God.
I'm gonna kill those guys.

We've got six minutes left!
How did that happen?
Look, have you got
anything for six minutes?
Have you rehearsed anything?
Anything? Anything?
Listen to me.
Listen to me.
Darlin', remember I said to you,
one door closes, another one opens?
You go downstairs.
Get your music
and come up and sing.
- Now?
- Lola, go, go, go.
You can do it.
He said, go! Go!
Before he gets done.
That gives shy persons
the strength to get up...
and do what needs to be done.
So, we'll look forward to seeing you
back here at the Fitzgerald Theater...
next week at this same time.
Brought to you once again
by your friends at Powdermilk Biscuits.
Six minutes.
Lola's gonna sing a song.
Your barn doors are open.
But first, we're going to bring
a young woman on...
to make her debut on our show.
Let's bring out this young
and very talented...
young woman who knows
all those good old songs...
to make her
very first performance...
right here on our radio show.
Please welcome now
the beautiful young Miss Lola Johnson.
Lola Johnson.

who's going a long way.
We're going, too.
We're out of here,
And that's our show.
Remember to keep
your feet on the ground...
your hopes up high...
pray for rain,
keep the humor dry...
and eat those Powdermilk Biscuits.

§ Come and sit by my side

§ Do not hasten to bid me adieu §
§ But remember the Red River Valley §
§ And the one

Show's almost over.
In more ways than one.
Nice perfume.
Who are you with? The show?
In a way.
I used to listen
to this show every week.
Hmm. Well, it was great in its time,
but the time's up. Life moves on.
It does.
So, be careful driving tonight.
Need a lift somewhere?
There's a shortcut to the airport.
A steep hill followed by a series
of sharp curves and a large oak tree.
What's your name?
Asphodel.
Pretty.
I like your hair that way.
§ Come and sit by my side... §
When I used to listen to them...
it was like they were all
my really good friends.
But something else happened, right?
Right.
Well...
I'm that something else.
§ But remember
the Red River Valley §
How long is the ride to the airport?
Twenty minutes.
She said there was a shortcut.
Yes, sir. I know it.
That was the last we saw of him.
The car hit a tree and blew up.
Good-bye, axeman.
But it didn't change a thing.
and the audience filed out
and everybody packed up and left.
First thing in the morning...
a truck from the demolition
company pulls up...
and two guys started drilling
for the explosives.
Just like ya learned
in eighth grade English.
§ So gather ye rosebuds while ye may §

Let me buy you a drink.
Ah!
Donna, make it three eggs over.
- No, listen to her.
- I was tellin' you.
What were you saying?
We are talkin'
about doin' a farewell tour.
- Yeah.
- Oh, who?
Oh, the whole gang
from the old radio show.
- Yeah.
- But the show's been over for years.
Yeah, I mean-
So? I always wanted to do
a farewell tour.
I loved doin' that last show.
I just want to do one last show
and then another one...
until I'm in a wheelchair.
I just want to keep doin' them.
You know, as long as I can
remember the words.
There's all sorts of towns
we haven't played.
I mean, you've got Gooseberry Falls
and Lake Winnebigoshish.
Up in Lake Winnebigoshish
a lot of people are waitin' to see us.
Well, you-don't count on me.
I got a lot of stuff happening.
What?
Oh, things.
Things that are in the works.
Different deals I'm... working out.
I'll be in and out of town a lot.
- Yeah, OK. So, what about you?
- Hey, I'm free.
- Oh!
- Great!
- Workin' at the parking ramp.
- The parkin' ramp?
Yes. It's a good job.
I like it.
I read a lot of books.
Make that four eggs.
Oh, boy.
You're readin' a lot.
- Yeah.
- That's interesting.
Oh, look at this!
Look who's here!
Oh, my God, I miss these guys.
Ha ha ha!
Look who just blew in
from the old prairie.
I thought you left town
ahead of the sheriff?
Well, the woman decided
not to press charges.
Oh, yeah?
What was the crime? Snorin'?
Ha ha ha!
Love.
We just got back in town...
from playin' the casinos
in South Dakota.
Yeah? Playin' what? Pinochle?
Ha ha ha!
Playin' our music.
Hey, we hear you might be
gettin' a tour up.
Oh, yeah.
We've added some rope tricks
to the repertoire.
Flaming lariats.
It's called "Rings of Fire. "
Well, you know,
we got a bus with bunk beds...
and we're goin' back
to playin' churches and schools.
Look at this.
She's only been workin' six months
and she's now the manager.
What does she do?
Um, I have no idea.
- Somethin' religious?
- Software.
Oh, it's big.
It's movin' like monkeys.
Hi.
All right, so, I looked
at your pension stuff.
Oh, good.
It's a horror show.
Have you ever heard of mutual funds?
You know, Mom, honestly,
you would have done a lot better...
if you'd just stuck it in a shoe box
and put it under your bed.
Well, that's why I
wanted you to help me.
So-here.
Sign there.
What is this?
I have to get your assets
working again.
- My what?
- Your assets.
Oh. Oh! Power of attorney.
Oh! And you spent $6,000 on a bus?
Yeah.
Why didn't you ask me first?
Well, I'm sorry.
So...
Can I keep the bus or?
We'll talk about it later.
- Hey-
- That sounds like a no.
I love you, too.
Bye, guys.
Donna?
- Bye!
- Oh, hey. Bye.
So long.
I thought that was
a terrific eulogy you gave...
for old man Soderberg
at his memorial service.
Thank you.
Too bad the old coot
couldn't have been there to hear it.
Yeah, and to have missed it
by just a few days.
Hmm. Ha ha!
Ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
I still love your laugh.
Oh, yeah.
- Hee hee hee!
- I got it.
I get bored.
Uh-huh.
Ha ha ha!
Thank you.
That joke just gets better and better.
- You know?
- Yep.
Anybody want to change their order?
Can I get a coffee?
Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha!
- Ha ha!
