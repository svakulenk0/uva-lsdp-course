GUARD1: The Assistant Warden wants
this one out of the block early.
Wants to get it
over with fast.
GUARD 2:
Okay, let's do it.
Psst! Hey.
Come on, wake up,
it's time.
Wake up.
Let's go, it's time.
PRISONER: Hey.
Well, this is it.
What wing?
GUARD 1: Maximum wing, Block 9.
Standard release?
Parole, three out of five.
Good behavior.
Give me a minute.
One Timex digital watch, broken.
One unused prophylactic.
One soiled.
Boots, black.
Belt, black.
One black suit jacket.
One pair
black suit pants.
One hat. Black.
One pair of sunglasses.
$23.07.
Sign here.
What's this?
What?
This car.
This stupid car.
Where's the Cadillac?
The Caddy. Where's the Caddy?
The what?
The Cadillac we used to have.
The Bluesmobile.
I traded it.
You traded the Bluesmobile
for this?
No, for a microphone.
A microphone?
Okay, I can see that.
What the hell is this?
This was a bargain.
I picked it up at the Mount Prospect
City Police Auction last spring.
It's an old Mount Prospect
police car.
They were practically
giving them away.
Well, thank you, pal.
The day I get out of prison,
my own brother
picks me up in a police car.
You don't like it?
No, I don't like it.
Car's got a lot of pickup.
It's got a cop motor,
a 440 cubic-inch plant.
It's got cop tires,
cop suspension, cop shocks.
It was a model made
before catalytic converters
so it'll run good
on regular gas.
What do you say?
Is it the new Bluesmobile,
or what?
Fix the cigarette lighter.
What are we doing here?
You promised you'd visit the
Penguin the day you got out.
Yeah. So, I lied to her.
You can't lie to a nun.
We gotta go in
and visit the Penguin.
No fucking way.
MARY: Who is it?
Jake and Elwood.
Come in.
Hello, boys.
Nice to see you.
Please, have a seat.
No, boys.
Come over here in front of me.
I want to see your faces.
The county took a tax assessment
of this property last month.
They want $5,000.
Doesn't the Church
have to pay that?
They would, if they were
interested in keeping the place.
But they aren't.
The Archbishop wants to
sell this building outright
to the Board
of Education.
What's gonna
happen to you?
I'll be sent to
the missions: Africa,
Latin America,
Korea...
JAKE: Forget it.
$5,000? No problem.
We'll have it for you
in the morning. Let's go.
No. I will not take your
filthy, stolen money!
Well, then.
I guess you're really
up shit creek.
I beg your pardon.
What did you say?
I offered to help you.
Mmm-hmm.
You refused to
take our money.
Mmm-hmm.
Then I said, "I guess you're
really up shit creek."
Ow! Christ, Jake,
take it easy, man.
Elwood!
OW, Shit!
Jesus Christ! Ow!
Shit! Goddamn it!
Son of a bitch!
Jesus Christ.
You son of a bitch!
You fat penguin!
Fuck this noise, man!
MARY: You are such
a disappointing pair.
I prayed
so hard for you.
It saddens
and hurts me
that the two young men
whom I raised
to believe in
the Ten Commandments,
have returned to me
as two thieves
with filthy mouths
and bad attitudes.
Get out!
And don't come back
until you've
redeemed yourselves.
Boys, you gotta learn
not to talk to nuns that way.
Jake, Elwood.
BOTH: Curtis!
Hey, man!
You look fine, man!
Good to see you, man!
Hey, buy you boys a drink?
Boys, things are bad.
They gonna sell this place
to the Board of Education
and I'll be out
on the street.
That money's got to be in the
Cook County Assessor's Office
within 11 days.
They wouldn't turn
you out, would they?
Shit. What's one more old nigger
to the Board of Education?
Curtis, you and the Penguin
are the only family we got.
You're the only one
that was ever good to us
singing Elmore James tunes and
blowing the harp for us down here.
Well, the sister
was right.
You boys could use
a little churching up.
Slide on down to
the Triple Rock
and catch Rev. Cleophus.
You boys listen to
what he's got to say.
Curtis,
I don't want to listen
to no jive-ass preacher
talking to me about
heaven and hell.
Jake, you get wise.
You get to church.
All I'm saying is we got
to figure out some way
to get that
money honestly.
That could be a problem.
It's like
the Penguin says.
We've got to make that
move towards redemption.
We got to
go to church.
We've got to
make that move towards redemption.
We got to go to church.
Bullshit.
Come on.
And now,
this week's sermon
is from our beloved,
the Rev. Cleophus James!
MAN: James.
WOMAN: Come on, Reverend!
MAN: Come on, preacher.
CLEOPHUS:
And now, people.
WOMAN: Take your time!
And now, people.
When I woke up
this morning
I heard a disturbing sound.
CONGREGATION: Yeah.
I said, when I woke
up this morning
I heard a disturbing sound!
What I heard
was the jingle-jangle
of a thousand lost souls!
I'm talking about the souls
of mortal men and women
departed from this life!
CLEOPHUS:
Wait a minute!
Those lost, anguished souls
roaming unseen over the earth,
seeking the divine light
they'll not find,
because it's too late!
Too late! Yeah!
Too late for them to ever see again
the light they once chose
not to follow. All right!
Don't be lost
when your time comes!
"For the day of
the Lord cometh
"as a thief
in the night."
Amen.
Say Amen!
Can I get Amen?
Well, well, well!
Let Us an

Yea, Lord
We'll put the band back
together, do a few gigs.
We get some bread.
Bang. $5,000.
Yeah, getting the band back together
might not be that easy, Jake.
What are you
talking about?
They split.
They all took
straight jobs.
Yeah? So you know
where they are.
You said you were keeping
in touch with them.
I got a couple of leads,
a few phone numbers.
But I mean, how many of them
visited or even wrote you, huh?
They're not the kind of
guys who write letters.
You were outside.
I was inside.
You were supposed to keep
in touch with the band.
I kept asking you if we
were gonna play again.
What was I gonna do,
take away your only hope?
Take away the very thing
that kept you going in there?
I took the liberty of
bullshitting you. Okay?
You lied to me.
It wasn't lies.
It was just bullshit.
Shit.
What?
Rollers.
No.
Yeah.
Shit.
What? What did I do?
You failed to stop
at a red signal.
The light was
yellow, sir.
May I see your license,
please?
God damn it!
Man, I haven't been pulled
over in six months.
I bet those
cops have got SCMODS.
SCMODS?
State County Municipal
Offender Data System.
Mmm-hmm.
Elwood, we show your license
currently under suspension.
Step out of
the car, please.
First you trade the
Cadillac for a microphone.
Then you lie to me
about the band.
Now you're gonna put me
right back in the joint.
They're not gonna catch us.
We're on a mission from God.
Elwood.
We are in high-speed pursuit
northbound on Courtland Avenue.
Black-and-white 1974 Dodge
sedan with Illinois plates.
Request assistance.
We'll be all right if we can
just get back on the expressway.
This don't look like
no expressway to me!
Don't yell at me.
What do you want me
to do, motor head?
Try not to be so negative
all the time.
Why don't you offer some
constructive criticism?
You got us
into this parking lot, pal.
Now you get us out!
You want out
of this parking lot? Okay.
Will there be anything else?
Yes. Do you have
a Miss Piggy?
There's Hanson Burgers.
Yeah,
lots of space in this mall.
Disco pants and haircuts.
Yeah.
Baby clothes.
This place has got everything.
New Oldsmobiles are
in early this year.
Pier 1 imports.
Oh, shit!
They broke my watch!
I'm gonna catch
that sucker
if it's the last thing
I ever do.
Nice place, huh?
Hey, Sam.
Hey, Lloyd.
Anybody call for me
on the phone?
No. No calls.
Some guy left this card.
Cop. Said he'd be back.
This here's
my brother, Jake.
He just got out
of the joint.
He's gonna be staying
with me for a few weeks.
Yeah. Okay.
Did you get me
my Cheez Whiz, boy?
Well, it ain't much,
but it's home.
How often does
the train go by?
So often you won't
even notice it.
What are you doing?
Making dinner.
Want some?
No.
Tomorrow we got to get
the band back together.
I'm gonna quit work in the
morning, first thing.
And how are you going to get to work, Mr.
Lead Foot,
Mr. Hot Redder,
Mr. Motor Head?
Those cops took
your license away.
They got your name,
your address.
No, they don't
got my address.
I falsified my renewal.
I put down 1060 West Addison.
That's Wrigley Field.
I gotta hit the sack.
ELWOOD: Hey, you sleaze! My bed!
This, gentlemen, is the elegant
abode of one Elwood Blues.
Thanks for your help,
Mr. Mercer.
I kind of like
the Wrigley Field bit.
Yeah, real cute.
All right, Sam?
Hi, has my friend
arrived yet?
Failed to report in
yesterday.
I don't want no trouble.
You just tell us where they are
and there'll be no trouble.
Stand back.
it's almost 9:00.
We've gotta go to work.
Well, Elwood,
sit down.
What's on your mind?
I got to quit.
Why is that, Elwood?
I'm going to
become a priest.
Well, okay.
Listen, I'll call payroll
and have them get
your severance pay ready.
Good luck.
God bless you, sir.
Well, thank you.
What's this?
This is the last
known address
of "Bones" Malone
and "Blue Lou" Marini.
The Lord works in
mysterious ways.
Yeah.
Mrs. Toronto?
Tarantino.
Ma'am, do you have a Thomas Malone
or Louis Marini living here?
Not anymore.
They moved out a long time ago.
I don't take in boarders,
not for a long time.
May we come in,
ma'am?
Please.
Did they leave a forwarding address?
A phone number?
No.
Did they live quietly?
What were their personal habits?
They were good boys
but they made a lot
of racket at night.
Are you the police?
No, ma'am.
We're musicians.
Mr. Man!
Mr. Man!
Mr. Man!
Yes, ma'am?
They left this card.
Maybe it'll help you?
Thanks.
Thank you.
You're marvelous.
You're marvelous.
Thank you.
I'm Murph, and these
are the Magic Tones.
Steve "The Colonel" Cropper,
Donald "Duck" Dunn,
Willie "Too Big" Hall
and Tom "Bones" Malone.
We'll be back for the Armada
Room's two-hour disco swing party
after this short break.
Till then,
don't you go changing.
So, Jake, you're out. You're free.
You're rehabilitated.
What's next? What's happening?
What you gonna do?
You got the money you
owe us, motherfucker?
Look, let's just get
something straight here-
The reason he got locked in
the slam in the first place
was for sticking up a gas
station to cover you guys.
You're kidding.
He pulled that job to pay for
the band's room-service tab
from that Kiwanis gig
in Coal City.
You did?
That's right.
So I don't want to hear anymore
of this small-change shit.
We're putting the band
back together.
Now, who here
at this table
can honestly say
that they played
any finer
or felt any better
than they did
than when they were with
the Blues Brothers?
You were the backbone.
The nerve center of a great
rhythm-and-blues band.
You can make that live,
breathe and jump again.
"Murph and the Magic Tones?"
Look at you in those
candy-ass monkey suits.
And I thought
I had it bad in Joliet.
At least we got a change
in clothes, sucker.
You're wearing the same shit
you had on three years ago.
Jake ain't lying.
We had a band powerful enough to
turn goat piss into gasoline.
We'll never get
that fat sound again.
Not without
some more horns.
We'll never get
Mr. Fabulous.
Where is he?
Forget it.
Mr. Fabulous is the top
maitre d' at the Chez Paul.
He's pulling down
six bills a week.
Matt Murphy got married.
Where is Matt
"Guitar" Murphy?
He opened
a soul food restaurant
with his old lady
on Maxwell Street.
And he took Blue Lou
with him.
You'll never get
Matt and Mr. Fabulous
out of them
high-paying gigs.
Oh, yeah?
Well, me and the Lord,
we got an understanding.
We're on a mission
from God.
Mainly French cuisine.
No, sir. Mayor Daley
no longer dines here.
He's dead, sir.
MR. FABULOUS: Private
dining rooms are available.
Oh, no. I thought it was
supposed to be 5 years.
Didn't you get 5 years?
Uh, no, sir, not you.
And your name, sir?
Rizzolo, for 8 at 11:30.
Thank you.
Mr. Fabulous, how marvelous
it is to see you.
You're looking
younger than ever.
Wait.
You guys can't come in here.
JAKE: Oh, nonsense,
my dear fellow.
My brother and I
have come to dine
to celebrate my early release
from the service of the state.
MR. FABULOUS:
Wait. Let's talk outside.
Let's have a cup
of coffee outside.
Why, heavens, no.
We seek a full meal and all
the compliments of the house.
Come, Elwood.
Let us adjourn ourselves
to the nearest table
and overlook this
establishment's board of fare.
Good evening.
Chez Paul. Wait! Hey!
Uh, sir, do you mind calling back
in about five minutes, please?
I'm sure, we'll have a table
for you in just a few moments.
Excuse me, won't you?
Give us a bottle
of your finest champagne,
five shrimp cocktails
and some bread for my brother.
We have a Dom Perignon,
'71, at $120.
That'll be fine, pal.
Come on. Seriously, you guys, the
food here is really expensive.
The soup is fucking $10.
Come on. Let's go outside.
I'll buy you a cup of coffee.
We're putting the band
back together.
Forget it. No way.
We're on a mission from God.
Hold it, hold it.
What's this?
Waiter? Sir?
Please, waiter?
Yes, sir?
How are your salads?
The salads are fine.
It's just that we'd like
to move to another table,
away from
those two gentlemen.
Why? Have they
been disturbing you?
No.
It's just that, well, frankly,
they're offensive... smelling.
I mean, they smell bad.
Excuse me, sir. I'll see if I can
locate another table for you.
Thank you.
Wrong glass, sir.
How much for the little girl?
The women?
How much for the women?
What?
Your women,
I want to buy your women.
The little girl.
Your daughters.
Sell them to me.
Sell me your children.
Maitre d'! Maitre d'!
Uh...
Hey, cut it out,
cut it out.
The owners are gonna ask me
to call the cops.
You wouldn't do that to me,
would you, man?
ELWOOD:
He just got out of Joliet.
He's on parole.
You can't call
the cops on him, man.
We're putting the band
back together.
I said no.
Absolutely not!
You! How much for your wife?
We're putting the band
back together.
We need you, man.
We need your horn.
I can't. I really can't.
We got everybody except Matt
“Guitar" Murphy and Blue Lou,
and we're getting them next.
No way.
If you say no,
Elwood and I
will come here for breakfast,
lunch and dinner
every day of the week.
Okay, okay. I'll play.
You got me.
MAN: Sir?
MAN: Sir?
Sir!
Sir!
Sir!
OFFICER: White men!
White women!
The swastika
is calling you!
The sacred and ancient
symbol of your race
since the beginning of time.
The Jew is using the black
as muscle against you.
And you are left there,
helpless.
Fuck you! Why don't you
go back where you belong?
What are you gonna do
about it, Whitey?
Just sit there?
MAN: Go back
where you came from!
Of course not!
Son of a bitch!
You are going to
join with us,
the members of
the American Socialist
White People 's Party.'
an organization of decent,
law-abiding white folk
just like you.
Blow it out your ass,
you bastards!
Go to hell!
I pledge allegiance
to Adolf Hitler.
MEN: I pledge allegiance
to Adolf Hitler.
The immortal leader
of our race.
The immortal leader
of our race.
To the order for
which he stands.
And to the order
for which he stands.
One great cause.
One great cause.
Sacred and invincible.
Sacred and invincible.
Hey, what's going on?
Those bums won their court case,
so they're marching today.
What bums?
The fucking Nazi Party.
Illinois Nazis.
I hate Illinois Nazis.
Heil Hitler!
ALL: Heil Hitler!
MAN: Ten hut!
Gruppenführer!
Yes, sir!
Gruppenführer, get that
car's license plate number.
We're gonna kill
that son of a bitch.
Boom, boom, DOOITI, DOOITI
Mmm-hmm

Walk your walk

Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen.
That was Boom Boom, the song
that I wrote, back in the '50s
MAN: No, you didn't.
...was such a big hit.
No, you didn't!
No, you didn't!
I wrote Boom Boom.
I wrote Boom Boom.
WAITRESS:
Can I help you, boys?
You got any
white bread?
Yes.
I'll have some toasted
white bread, please.
You want butter or jam
on that toast, honey?
No, ma'am. Dry.
Got any fried chicken?
Best damn chicken
in the state.
Bring me four fried
chickens and a Coke.
You want chicken wings
or chicken legs?
Four fried chickens
and a Coke.
And some dry
white toast, please.
You all want anything
to drink with that?
No, ma'am.
A Coke.
Be up in a minute.
We got two honkies
out there
dressed like Hasidic
diamond merchants.
Say what?
They look like they're from
the CIA or something.
What they wanna eat?
The tall one wants
white bread. Toast.
Dry. With nothing on it.
Elwood!
And the other one wants four
whole fried chickens and a Coke.
And Jake! Shit!
The Blues Brothers!
Hi, Jake.
Matt! How you doing?
How you doing?
How was Joliet?
Oh, it's bad.
On Thursday night they serve
a wicked pepper steak.
Can't be as bad as
the cabbage rolls
at the
Terre Haute Federal Pen.
Or that oatmeal
at the Cook County Slammer.
They're all pretty bad.
Matt! Me and Elwood,
we're putting the band
back together.
We need you and Blue Lou.
Oh, man. Don't talk
that way around here.
My old lady,
she'll kill me.
ELWOOD: Ma'am,
you gotta understand.
This is a lot bigger
than any domestic problems
you might be experiencing.
Matt, what the hell
is he talking about?
Don't get riled, sugar.
Don't you,
"don't get riled, sugar" me!
Now, you not going back
on the road no more.
And you ain't playing any more
two-bit, sleazy dives.
You're living with me now.
And you're not gonna
go sliding around
with your old
white hoodlum friends.
But, babes!
This is Jake and Elwood!
The Blues Brothers!
The Blues Brothers!
Shit!
They still owe you money,
fool!
Ma'am, would it make you feel
any better if you knew that
what we're asking Matt
here to do is a holy thing?
You see,
we're on a mission from God.
Don't you blaspheme in here!
Don't you blaspheme in here!
Now, this is my man,
this is my restaurant,
and you two are gonna just
walk right out that door,
without your dry,
white toast,
without your
four fried chickens
and without
Matt "Guitar" Murphy!
Now, you listen to me!
I love you.
But I'm the man
and you're the woman.
And I'll make the decisions
concerning my life!
You better think
about what you saying.
You better think about the
consequences of your actions.
Oh, shut up, woman!
You better think
WOMEN:  Think
Think about what
you're trying to do to me
Yeah, think
Think, think
Let your mind go

Just a child

It don't take too much high IQ
to see what you're doing to me
You better think

Hey!

Tryin' to make other people
lose their mind

Pardon me, but we do
have a strict policy
concerning the handling
of the instruments.
An employee of Ray's Music
Exchange must be present.
Now, may I help you?
Ray, it's me. Joliet Jake.
I once rented some column
speakers from you for my band,
The Blues Brothers.
Hey, Ray. it's me, Murph, of
Murph and the Magic Tones.
Remember me?
I bought three Fender amps.
RAY: Oh, we sell a lot
of amplifiers.
Not like these.
They were beautiful.
Upholstered with thick,
red shag.
Oh, right, right!
I remember now.
As a matter of fact, I'll buy
them all back for $350 a piece.
$350?
I paid $800 each,
not 6 months ago.
Well, you know
depreciation, man.
Ray, we're here to buy stuff.
We need pianos,
amps, mikes, the works.
Now, go on! Get!
Breaks my heart,
a boy that young going bad.
Tell me a little about this
electric piano, Ray.
Oh, you have a good eye,
my man.
That's the best
in the city of Chicago.
How much?
$2,000 and it's yours.
You can take it
home with you.
Matter of fact, I'll throw
in the black keys for free.
$2,000 for this
chunk of shit?
Come on, Ray!
I mean, really, Ray.
It's used.
There's no action left
in this keyboard.
Uh, uh, uh, excuse me.
I don't think
there's anything wrong
with the action on this piano.
Well,
fella you've been dancing with
All over the neighborhood
So, why didn't you
ask me, baby
Or didn't you
think I could?
Well, I know that the
boogaloo is out of sight
But the shingaling's
the thing tonight
But if that was
you and me out there, baby
I would have shown you
how to do it right
Do it right
JAKE AND ELWOOD: Uh-huh.
Do it right
Do it right
JAKE AND ELWOOD:
Do it right
ALL: Aaah
Twisting
Shake it, shake it, baby

Shake it out, baby

Twisting

Twisting
Shake it, shake it, baby
Okay, man.
We'll take
these axes.
Naturally. And as usual,
I gotta take an IOU.
JAKE: You guys go inside,
get yourselves a bite.
I've got to
make a phone call.
Now, Jake, does this phone
call concern our first gig?
Have I ever
lied to you?
What are we
gonna do, man?
We don't got
no gig.
How much money
you got?
I got a quarter.
That's enough for
a phone call. Come on.
What are you
doing, Elwood?
You said we were
gonna make a call.
I said I was
gonna make a call.
Who are you
gonna call, Jake?
Do you remember
Maury Sline?
Sline? Booking agent?
What about him?
He got us some good showcases
in the old days.
He got us the Morgan Park,
he got us the Tick Took.
I got him laid.
He owes me.
Give it a shot.
Hey, Jake.
There's got to be at least
$7 worth of change here.
Yeah?
Sir.
What did you
find out?
Okay.
I called a friend at
the Motor Vehicle Department.
That license plate is like a
rash all over the computer.
The car belongs to
a known traffic menace.
What's his name?
His name is Elwood Blues.
He's got
a record a mile long.
And he's a Catholic.
Did you get
his address?
Of course.
Let's go.
Anybody with
that kind of record
is gonna make a mistake.
I want all party members
in the tri-state district
to monitor
the city, county,
and state police
on their C.B.s.
Mr. Blues is gonna fuck up.
And when he does,
he better pray the police
get to him before we do.
All right, man.
We've been in this car
for three hours now.
Where the hell is this place?
I told you it'd take
a little while to get there.
What's the name
of the place?
Uh, the name
of the place is, uh,
Bob's Country Bunker.
Here we are.
Bob's Country Bunker?
Jake,
the sign says,
"Tonight only,
the Good Ole Boys."
Blues Brothers!
It should read,
"Tonight only,
"the Blues Brothers'
triumphant return."
Must be
some kind of mistake.
You guys
unload the stuff.
Elwood, come with me.
What can I
get you boys?
You thirsty, you hungry
or just driving through?
Maybe you'd like a beer,
or something a little harder?
We happen to make the
state's best pepper steak.
No, thank you, ma'am!
We may be sucking back a few
beers a little later on.
We'll be here all night.
You see, we're the band.
You are?
Oh, gee, that's nice!
Hey, Bob,
this is the band!
All right!
What kind of music
do you usually have here?
We got both kinds.
We got country and western.
Jake, are you sure
this is the place?
Yeah! Sure!
This is the place.
Hi! You the Good Ole Boys?
That's us!
The rest of the band's
out in the parking lot
getting our stuff together.
Well, I'm sure glad
to have you boys here.
I'm Bob and this
here is my place.
It's a beautiful place, Bob!
BOB: I guess you wanna get your
steel guitars and everything
set up on stage,
don't you?
Claire, go and turn
those stage lights on
and get these boys
going up there.
Chicken wire?
What do you say we set
up for sound check?
Excuse me, sonny, I guess
I'll give this to you.
You're the tallest one.
Okay, what is it?
Well, that there
is a list of the songs
you boys will be
playing tonight.
Man, I don't think we know any
of the songs on this list.
This list doesn't mean anything.
They're just requests.
Do our regular set.
First tune!
Give Me Some Loving.
One, two.
One, two, three, four.
Shit!
What are those damn freak
pecker heads playing?
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.
We're glad to be here
in Kokomo tonight.
We're the Good Old Blues
Brothers Boys Band from Chicago.
We sure hope
you'll like our show.
I'm Elwood.
This is my brother Jake.
Well, my temperature 's
rising And my feet on the floor
Crazy people knockin'
'Cause they wanted some more
Let me in, baby
I don't know what you got
You better take it easy
'Cause this place is hot
And I'm so glad
you made it
That ain't no
Hank Williams song!
Give me some loving
MAN: Get off the stage!
Give me some loving
Every day
Why'd they turn
off the lights?
Maybe they blew a fuse.
I don't think so, man.
Those lights are off
on purpose.
We gotta figure out something
these people like, and fast!
I got it.
Remember the theme from Rawhide?
The old favorite.
Rowdy Yates.
What key?
A.
Good country key.
Rawhide in A.
Rollin', rollin', rollin'
Though the streams
are swollen
Keep them dogies rollin'
Rawhide
The rain and wind and weather
Hellbent for leather

Theme from the TV show Rawhide.
Thank you.
We'd like to do a favorite
of the horn section.
We hope
it's one of yours.
Sometimes
it's hard to be a woman
Giving all your love
To just one man
And if you love him
Oh, be proud of him
'Cause after all
He's just a man
Stand by your man
Give him two arms
to cling to
And something warm
to come to
When nights are
cold and lonely
Stand by your man
And tell the world
you love him
Keep giving
all the love you can
Stand by your man
Stand by your man
And show the world
you love him
Keep giving
all the love you can
Baby
Stand by your man
JAKE: Well, folks, it's
time to call it a night.
But do what you feel, and
keep both feet on the wheel.
You don't have to go home
but you can't stay here.
So, till next time:
ELWOOD:  Move

Let's get the hell
out of here.
Shit, I wanna
tell you boys
that's some of the best
goddamn music we've had
at the Country Bunker
in a longtime.
Sorry we couldn't remember
The Wreck of the Old 97.
Why, hell!
You guys can learn it next
time when you come back.
Bob, about our money
for tonight.
That's right.
$200
and you boys drank
$300 worth of beer.
When we first came in
the bar lady never charged
us for the first round
so, like, we figured beer was
complimentary for the band.
Beer was, like, complimentary
for the band, you know.
No.
Well, I'll just go out
and take up a collection
from the boys.
Well, I'll tell you,
I sure would appreciate it.
I say this trip
is nowhere, man.
I say we gotta quit.
What? Quit?
Well, I wish you guys
would make up your mind.
Otherwise, I've gotta call
Mr. Ronzini
at the Holiday Inn and
get our old gig back.
Back at the Armada Room?
Listen, they want us to pay
for the beer we drank.
So you guys better split.
The next gig is
gonna be dynamite!
Huge! You'll see.
I say we give
The Blues Brothers
just one more chance.
Why not?
If the shit fits, wear it!
Scoot over, goddamn it!
Boys look
a little upset.
Hey, man.
Don't worry.
We got
a couple of days.
We'll get
the Penguin's tax money.
I mean, look.
We got an appointment
to see Mr. Sline tomorrow.
Everything's
gonna be all right.
Let's skate.
Goddamn it.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Are you The Good Ole Boys?
Yeah, that's right.
I'm Tucker McElroy,
lead singer,
driver of the Winnebago.
I'd like to talk to you,
but we're running very late.
My name is Jacob Stein,
American Federation
of Musicians Union,
Local 200.
I've been sent here
to see
if you gentlemen are
carrying your permits.
Our what?
Your union cards.
May I see
your cards, please?
Suppose we ain't got
no union cards,
and we go in
and start playing anyway.
What you gonna do about that?
You gonna stop us? Stein?
You gonna look
pretty funny trying to eat
corn on the cob
with no fucking teeth!
Listen,
let me talk to Bob,
the owner.
See if we can put your band
on contract waivers
for tonight.
I don't want you to
move from this spot.
Just let me
handle this.
We'll, uh...
We'll talk to Bob.
Get in the car
and start her up.
You know you boys
owe me a lot of money
for that beer
you drank tonight!
Goddamn it!
Bob, we loved
playing here tonight.
My brother's writing out
an American Express
traveler's cheque
to cover the extensive
bar tab.
Well, I sure
would appreciate it.
I'd better check up,
see how he's doing.
See, I have to sign it, too.
I usually sit in the car
and write it out
on the, uh,
glove compartment lid.
Okay?
I need a pencil.
Were them guys
from the union?
Union?
What the hell union?
Those boys
skipped out of here
owing me a lot
of money for beer.
What the hell are you guys
all dressed up for?
We're The Good Ole Boys!
You're The Good Ole Boys?
A.F.M. Shit!
Our Lady of
Blessed Acceleration,
don't fail me now!
I don't believe it!
It's that
shitbox Dodge again.
The bastards
are ours now!
Holy shit!
Boys, you're in big trouble.
Maury, you owe me.
We'll play anywhere,
anytime, for anybody.
Put us in, uh,
the Double Up Lounge,
or the Morgan Park Theater,
or the Crystal.
We always knocked them
dead in those joints.
Discos.
They're all discos.
Singles.
Mixed singles, gay singles.
Those people like to
tumble and carry on.
They like to dance
with each other.
We are a dance band.
I don't know, boys.
I just don't know.
Times have changed,
you know what I mean?
What are you guys gonna do?
The same act?
You wear the same
farchadat suits.
You'll scare people away.
Don't you ever wear
blue jeans or jumpsuits
like Wayne Cochran
and the C.C. Riders?
You gotta come
through for us.
We need $5,000, fast.
$5,000?
Who do you think you are?
The Beatles?
You know the size hall you gotta
work to take in that kind of money?
We'll fill any hall
in the country.
You guys familiar with
the Palace Hotel ballroom?
Never heard of it.
Nice place up north.
Built in the '40s
on Lake Wazapamani.
That seats 5,000.
You guys fill that place,
you can make $5,000, easy.
Book us for
tomorrow night.
Hold it!
Tomorrow night?
A gig like that, you gotta
prepare the proper exploitation.
I know about that stuff.
I been exploited all my life.
Forget it. There's no way with you guys.
Forget about it.
Say, how's Mrs. Sline?
I might have some information
she'd like to know.
You blackmailing me?
If you wanna put it that way.
Maury, we need this gig!
We're on a mission
from God.
You get us the hall,
and I guarantee
we'll pack them in
from miles around.
What do you say?
Okay. I'll get you
the Palace Hotel.
I'll print up showbills.
I'll make
the place look
real pretty, okay?
I don't think you guys
are gonna gross dollar one.
But if you do, I want a
taste of the gate, okay?
Thanks, Maury.
Let's go, boys!
Listen,
you boys heard me talk about
Jake and Elwood.
Well, they used to live here,
just like you.
And I used to sing to them,
just like with you.
Tonight,
Jake and Elwood are
going out to sing and play
to raise money to
help you children.
Your lazy butts
are in this, too!
So get up on that wagon.
We're going up north
to put the word
in the streets.
ELWOOD: Tonight only,

Rhythm and Blues Revue

How we doing?
So far we covered
Lake, McHenry
and part of
DuPage County.
Good.
Let's get to the gig.
What is it?
We're out of gas.
Oh, shit.
MURPHY: Wow, a classic.
What a room!
This place is gonna
swing tonight.
It's a fucking barn.
We'll never fill it.
We've gotta fill
this hall tonight.
A lot of young children
are depending on it.
Young children?
Why, what do you mean?
Jake and Elwood are donating the
band's share of the door money
to pay the taxes on the Saint
Helen's Orphanage in Calumet City.
ALL: What?
We're out of gas.
Yep.
Mind if we fill her up?
Nope.
I said we're out of gas.
Tanker truck's late.
Should have been here two hours ago.
Uh, it's always late
on Thursdays.
I guess
we'll have to wait.
Yeah.
WOMAN:
Excuse me, sir.
Yes, you. Could you fill it up
with premium, please,
and check under the hood?
Sure.
You, uh, want I should, uh,
wash the dead bugs
off the windshield?
Oh, no. Don't worry.
I'm in kind of a hurry.
Where in the hell are they?
So, uh, maybe
you'd like to come by
and see the show.
Oh, um, I'm awfully sorry,
but I do have
a prior dinner engagement.
Thanks, Marvin.
Debbie, get me
Troopers Daniel and Mount.
BOB: I don't see
those Blues Brothers.
We'll wait.
Okay, you're all set.
That'll be, uh, $94.
Here's $95.
Thank you, Elwood.
Okay.
And that's $1 change.
Oh, keep the change.
Oh, thanks.
Uh, so, look.
Uh, if your date
don't work out
tonight for any reason, uh,
there's a motel
up on the interstate.
Uh, maybe we could,
say, uh, meet
around, uh, midnight?
I'll think about it,
Elwood, okay?
ELWOOD: Yeah.
Bye.
Son of a bitch!
Come on!
Ow!
We're really late.
You better step on it, man.
Yeah.
I always like to perform
for angry mobs.
You can't quit now.
What can they be doing?
My head hurts.
That Night Train's
a mean wine.
You'd better get bright!
We got a show to do.
Then we gotta figure out some
way to collect that gate money,
get it to the Cook County
Assessor's office
as soon as they open
in the morning.
We want the show!
Gentlemen,
I'm leaving.
Man, we were so close.
Hey, you guys know
Minnie The Moocher?
I knew a hooker once
named Minnie Mazola.
No! The song
Minnie the Moocher.
Yeah. So what?

The Mafia's
after us now.
You guys were hot!
You were great! Insane.
I've got to record you.
Bullshit.
Bullshit?
I don't bullshit.
I'm president of
Clarion Records
the largest recording company
on the Eastern seaboard.
So what?
Here's $10,000.
An advance on your first
recording session.
Is it a deal?
Yeah. Sure, it's a deal.
Yeah. Sure, it's a deal!
Listen, all these
cops out here,
they're sort of
waiting for us.
We gotta get out with nobody seeing us.
You know a back door out?
Sure. I used to be head bouncer
here back in the '70s.
There's an electrical
service duct
right behind your
drummer's riser.
Do us a favor.
Take $1,400
and give it to Ray's Music
Exchange in Calumet City
and give the rest
to the band.
You got it.
Thanks.
Bye.
Bye.
Me and Elwood are gonna
make a break for it.
You and the band
keep playing.
Something's wrong.
Where's Jake?
Where'd those
Blues Brothers go?
I sure hope this thing
leads someplace.
Elwood,
we're gone, man.
Who is that girl?
Well, Jake.
You look just
fine down there
slithering in the mud
like vermin.
No problem.
You're not gonna get
away from me this time.
Check that out!
Let's go!
It's good to see you,
sweetheart!
You contemptible pig.
I remained celibate for you.
I stood at
the back of a cathedral
waiting,
in celibacy, for you
with 300 friends and relatives
in attendance.
My uncle hired
the best Romanian caterers
in the state.
To obtain the seven limousines
for the wedding party
my father used up
his last favors
with Mad Pete Trullo.
So for me, for my mother,
my grandmother,
my father, my uncle,
and for the common good
I must now kill you
and your brother.
Oh, please don't kill us!
Please, please, don't kill us.
You know I love you, baby!
I wouldn't leave you!
It wasn't my fault!
You miserable slug!
You think you can talk
your way out of this?
You betrayed me!
No, I didn't. Honest!
I ran out of gas!
I had a flat tire!
I didn't have enough
money for cab fare!
My tux didn't come
back from the cleaners.
And old friend came
