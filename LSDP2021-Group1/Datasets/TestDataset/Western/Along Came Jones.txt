Tall and skinny, mean tempered
and extra fast with gun
Travels with half-wit uncle
called Uncle Roscoe something
# Round and round we're goin'
# Round and round, Old Joe Clarke
And bye-bye, Lucy Long
# Old Joe Clarke, he had a wife
# She was seven feet tall
# She slept with her head in the kitchen
And her big feet in the hall
# I wished I had a sweetheart
# I'd put her on the shelf
# And every time she'd grin at me
I'd get up there myself
# Round and round #
Melody, how many verses
you say there was to that song?
About 100, I reckon
- 100
- But I only know about 90 of 'em
# Bye-bye, Lucy Long
# Round and round, Old Joe Clarke
# Round and round we're goin' #
Melody, what is it?
Some cow town, it looks like
How come here?
I thought there wasn't any till Hot Creek
- I don't know, unless
- Unless what?
George, you recollect that fork in the road
I just remembered we should have turned left
It don't surprise me none
A cowhand that goes in for breaking horses,
he's been hit
in the seat of the pants so many times,
he ain't got any brains any more,
just oatmeal in his head
# I wished I was a big, red apple
# Hanging on a tree
# And every pretty girl that come along
# Would take a bite out of me
# Round and round, Old Joe Clarke
# Round and round we're goin'
# Round and round, Old Joe Clarke
# Bye-bye, Lucy Long #
- Howdy, friend
- Howdy
- Where are we, old-timer?
- This here's Payneville
Painful? What's painful?
- This here is
- You mean generally or is this personal?
It's a bad sign when the first fella you meet
in a town is some kind of hobgoblin
Don't go far I don't aim to be drinking
for more than five or six hours
- Is that him?
- Yes, I think so
# Round and round, Old Joe Clarke
# Round and round we're goin'
# Round and round, Old Joe Clarke
# Bye-bye, Lucy Long #
I guess she's got as much right
to get thirsty as a man
- Look She's coming out
- Just look at that walk
Very nice
Very nice
- No, Ira Don't
- Let go of me
No, look!
I didn't mean nothin'
I didn't know
All right From now on, don't go
making remarks about other men's girls
Yes, sir
No, no, sir No
- What's the matter with you?
- Nothing,
You want something maybe, please?
Give me some of them
- Open 'em I'll eat 'em here
-
Again
Don't try to draw with him
If you do, you're dead
- Did he see me?
- No
I thought he did
He'll cross back over to get his horse
We pushed a thousand head of cattle out there,
me and my partner, him and me
What's more, you fuzzy-faced apes, my name
ain't Roscoe and I ain't nobody's uncle
The next one that calls me so
will get down on the floor
Don't look for me back, either
I will invest my money
where at least one man ain't a lunatic
- Drunk already?
- Let's get outta this place
It's a spook town
The more I see, the more I don't like it
- They do something?
- No, outside of calling me their uncle
It's their attitude They're disrespectful
George, you take gettin' used to
You don't make the right impression
- You ought to know that by now
- Ought I?
You walk in someplace where nobody don't
know you, you already got that dumb look
You ask some fool question any papoose
could answer, like, "Where am I?"
You ain't immediately nominated for governor
You gotta walk in kinda unsmiling
Unsmiling?
Look and act like you're somebody, like you can
take care of yourself no matter what happens
- Pretty soon you are somebody
- That what you done?
I ain't said more than two words in this town
and already I got a certain standing
Unsmiling, eh?
I can walk in any place and clear my own place
at the bar until they even before they know me
- All right Come with me
- Huh?
Come with me
Mr Unsmiling Jones
Thought you said you weren't coming back
- Your pleasure, gentlemen?
- Some liquor
Yes, sir
Stop goggling You're with me
- Mud in your eye
- Thank you, sir Thank you very much
- Good stuff
- Yeah
- I make it myself
- How much?
On the house, any time
Much obliged
You see?
It's spooked
The whole dad-blamed town is spooked
We gotta get outta this place quick
Why, it's all very simple, George
Simple? What would you have done
if somebody had drawn on you?
What would anyone draw on me for?
Because you was asking for it The way
you walked in, your face all scrounged up
It was just asking somebody
to slap leather with you
Well
Look, Melody, you couldn't hit the hind end
of your horse with a handful of bug shot
- Right in front
- He'll move
You ain't a gun fighter
You ain't even a good shot
You're just a no-good bronc stomper
that's been hit in the seat of the pants
eoeok
He's looking at something else
Darlin'!
Monte!
Don't move There's a gun on you
- Come with me Keep close
- Listen, lady
Do as I tell you
and I'll get you out of this Smile Smile
That's better
Stay right here and I'll get your horses
-  Who is it?
- I never seen her before
In Cherryenne when you was
kicked in the head and missing four days,
you sure you didn't marry somebody?
I wasn't that far out of my head
Whoa
- Keep close to the front wheel
- But
- You looking to get shot?
- No
Then do what I say
When you start moving, move
Now can you tell us what happened?
- What's them initials stand for?
- That's for my name, Melody Jones
For Monte Jarrad too
You don't look much like him, really
Excepting you're built something like him
- Tall and spindly
- They took me for somebody else?
That's why I did what I did,
so's you wouldn't get killed by mistake
Oh
- Then it wasn't me they were scared of?
- They thought you was Monte Jarrad
You say somebody is fixing
to kill this here Monte Jarrad?
- Nobody but the sheriff and his posse
- Any particular reason outside of prejudice?
Well, there's always the reward, of course
Mr Unsmiling Jones,
a man with a certain standing in the community
Whoa
- Is this Monte?
- No, they just took him for Monte
Of course it's Monte
Hi, Monte Heard a lot about you
Don't pay no attention to Pop
He's a little mixed up
This is Uncle Roscoe, ain't it?
Hi, Uncle Roscoe
I'd ask you to alight and eat, but I think
you'd better keep going, south
I ain't in any hurry
Can't you understand?
There's gonna be a posse after you
Not after me I ain't done nothin'
- Ain't you gonna alight?
- No, he's gonna keep going
You can't be as thick-headed as that
This country's full of men
just aiming to shoot you on sight
- Get outta here while you still can
- You heard what she said
- Get going
- Who are you?
He's my brother Avery
Now, are you going?
All right
Come on Uncle Roscoe
Cherry
Cherry
Let me in, Cherry
That's just the way it was
One punch and Ira Waggoner
was flat in the road
Wish he'd broken his neck That's what I get
for tyin' up with somebody I ain't never seen
- You don't even know Waggoner?
- I never saw him Leo picked him
It was fixed that the shotgun guy that got me
was gonna be left behind
Outside the horse,
there wasn't supposed to be no shootin'
- I got a good mind to blast his belly open
- That's right
- Get outta here!
- I was
Never mind Get to town and look for Leo,
so I don't have to slope outta here by myself
Sure, Monte
You stay here
Now, what about this fella?
- He's nothing but a tramp cowhand
- Stop talking like a fool or like I'm a fool
How do you know
he ain't one of Luke Packard's men?
Come on, Monte Sit down
There Now, he's nothing but a tramp cowhand
who just wandered into Payneville
with an old side rider
On account of the initials on his saddle,
they took him for you
Cotton was fixing to shoot him
when I got this idea
I figured the best thing I could do was
help them keep on thinking he was you
Tomorrow, the posse'll be ridin' after him
and the north'll be wide open for you
- See anything wrong about that?
- Yeah
Nobody's as stupid as you make him out to be
He's just a common, ordinary,
useless bronc stomper,
like you see any way you looked around here
He'd have done anything I asked him to
He would, huh?
He did, didn't he?
He kinda liked you?
Yeah, it looked like it
That's what I thought it was
You better be glad he did, too
There's something maybe you better remember
And never mind tellin' me
how it didn't mean nothin' to you
Just don't monkey around with nobody at all,
unless you wanna see their belly blasted open
In my life, I ain't never been so low in my mind
as since I talked to that there girl
If we aim to get across that line,
we ought to hustle up these ponies
- I don't aim to cross any line
- What are you talking about?
I don't aim to get across any line
because that's what she wants us to do
I worked that out before her mouth shut
- You mean there ain't no posse?
- Sure, and it's probably trailin' us
There wouldn't be if she hadn't sicked it on us
Are you telling me
that there pretty lady is a skunk?
Something happened back there
we don't know what it is
If that posse's trailing us to the south,
it'd make an opening
for somebody to get away to the north
- I can't believe it
- Where is that somebody else now?
If what you say is a fact,
he's hid out round that same place
- That's the way I figured it too
- Leastways, if she ain't, he
Wait a minute, Melody
You ain't gotta be no dumber than necessary
That would make me somebody
The man that took Monte Jarrad
- Now, you look here
- You don't understand, George
But for one hour back there
I felt what it felt like to be high-regarded
- I'm never gonna feel the same again
- But that fella's a killer
I might even get
you can't tell get to be sheriff
That or a corpse One or the other
Now, you just listen to me
- Where are you goin'?
- Back
But listen, Melody Melody!
You go on if you want to
If only you could shoot a little better
What are we supposed to be doing?
Playing Indians?
You gonna ask her where he is?
I ain't figured out yet what I'm gonna do
I was mixed up in shootin' once I can't tell you
how quick I got sick of the whole idea
Mm-hm!
- He's changed, Avery
- He can't help it He's in trouble
They're chasin' him and he's wounded
No, it's more than that
You know, when we were all kids together,
just growin' up,
he was kind of wild, of course
That's why I was so crazy about him, I guess
But it ain't wildness now He's mean
Plain, downright mean
And he's gettin' meaner all the time
There she is now Ask her
What you got in this mattress? Skulls?
Take your dirty feet off my bed
You've really got a crust
- My horse run off and I
- Shh!
Look, I don't know if you're crazy,
but you've gotta get out of here
- I'll get you another horse and saddle
- I couldn't leave without Henry
- Your partner?
- No, Henry's my horse
I couldn't leave him, specially with his bridle on
- Where is your partner?
- George?
He's out somewhere in the brush
He's the nervous type
Oh
In some kind of a fix, ain't you?
Of course not All I'm trying to do
is to keep you out of a fix
Don't you see?
That's why I took you out of town
You mean when you called me Monte
in the middle of the street?
You've got it crazy about this Monte, ain't you?
Look, I'll tell you what I'll do
I'll make a deal with you
- What'd you do that for?
- Your dog's seen something
Somebody's prowling around out there
Your partner, maybe
No, he'd fall over something
Sounds like he's gone now
What kind of a deal?
Will you do somethin' for me?
Sure
- Stay in this room until morning?
- Do what?
Sleep here, in that bed?
For me? Will you?
- Why?
- I'll explain it in the morning
I just don't want you goin' outta here tonight
- All right
- You promise?
Sure
Thank you
- And for Pete's sake, stay put this time, will you?
- Mm
- Thanks Good night
- Uh
You don't wanna sit and talk a spell first?
Heaven forbid
- Stick 'em up
- You surely took long enough about it
- You heard me?
- I been listenin' to you for about five minutes
You always wanna shoot 'em in the right eye
Spoils their aim
I went back into town last night
To look into things
What'd you find out?
The way it looks now, as long as you keep on
lettin' anybody think you're Monte Jarrad,
you've got five chances of being hung or shot,
which a fella tells me is a record in these parts
How come?
One the sheriff's got just about
everybody in this county in a posse
that ain't got no other aim in life
but to catch you and hang you
Two there's a family
in this county named Cotton
that you killed three members of
five years ago
This family, which has got
about 150 uncles and cousins,
is conducting an independent hunt
to kill you ahead of the posse
Three?
Three if neither one of them crowds get you,
the express company has got its men here
because 40,000 dollars in cash
was taken off that stage.
Some say 40 million,
but that sounds like an overstatement to me
Four failing all them people gettin' you,
you can look for
the United States Cavalry to arrive
There was some mail on that stage
They aim to kill you both 'cause you is
Monte Jarrad and 'cause you ain't Monte Jarrad,
and they just don't like to be disappointed
You said five
And five if you keep on looking at
a certain female lady the way you've been,
I think we could count on Monte Jarrad himself
to take a hand in the shooting soon
If this Monte Jarrad is such a well-known,
popular sort of a jigger,
- how come I get mistook for him?
- Monte ain't been back for five years
Besides, you ain't run into nobody
that knowed him good
You ain't fooled nobody
that really knowed Monte
- I got a message for you
- I don't know nobody in Payneville
It was hardly a social introduction,
but you did knock him over
Name's Ira Waggoner
He drove the stage that Monte held up
- How'd he know about me?
- He don't
"Give this to Monte," he said
Everybody thinks you're him
Everybody but this little lady skunk
you're taking up with
Skunk, huh?
Mornin'
Cherry George didn't mean that
He was just shootin' off his face
- No, he's right
- Look, Cherry
Aw, what George thinks ain't what I think
You go on about your business
any which way you wanna go
Now, look here There ain't any use to this
- You don't have to cry
- Please I am a skunk, and I know it
You ain't a skunk
You've been nice,
even though you knew I was lyin'
I'm sorry I drug you into it Goodbye
Look, what kind of a box is it you're in?
Can't you tell me?
You see, I've known Monte Jarrad
ever since we was kids
We grew up together
So when he rode in hurt, I tried to help him
- Did you get him out?
- No
They'll catch him now, I guess
The posse'll be pounding back by this evening
When I told you that I'd explain,
I decided to tell you the whole truth
and see if you'd help me
Take a saddle,
or anything to lead the posse away
There just wasn't nobody else I could turn to
You'd do anything for that belly gunner
This morning I decided not to
It wouldn't be fair dragging you in no further
I was gonna tell you the truth all right
I wasn't gonna ask you to do nothin' else
That why you brung
Monte's saddle along with you?
What?
Why, I didn't know it was there
I thought you might have noticed it
when you put this blanket over it
I don't know why I even try to lie to you
Me neither
Come on, Henry
- What are you doing?
- Changing saddles
- You're gonna do it?
- It's what you wanted, ain't it?
Well, yes, but
Melody, you can make it, can't you?
I hope so.
They'll see you with the saddle
and tell which way you went
You'll have such a lead, you'll make it
If you mean do I aim to get caught,
the answer is no
A fella can stand just so much
of that pounding, and then
I'm awful grateful to you
Is there something I can do for you, maybe?
Sure You can take care of my saddle
All right
Melody, ride as hard as you can
and don't stop for nothin'
Goodbye
Well, that sinks the duck
Thank you
Thank you
- I meant goodbye
- Goodbye
Would you take something from me for keeps?
I won it for bronc stomping
last year at Cherryenne
I was 17th.
Thanks, champ
Giddy-up!
Melody! Where you goin'?
Melody!
Whoa
He's gone with your saddle
You can see it a mile off
You said last night he'd left the house
Where'd he stay?
I don't know, Monte He just disappeared
- Start movin'
- Sure, Monte
You know what I'd do if you crossed me
I know you're in trouble,
but I don't like that kind of talk
I didn't ask you what you liked
Just be careful what you're doin'
I'm gonna pick up Uncle Roscoe,
and then I'm on my way
When you get through with what I told you to do,
I'll send for you Be ready
- Can I get by?
- Ten
- Up ten
- I call
You fellas oughta let people pass
when they ask you
- Waggoner
- Back
You wanna see me?
Sit down
You needn't keep watching my gun
You couldn't stop it
There's only three men in these parts
I can't slap leather with One is Monte Jarrad
- But you ain't him
- No?
No You had me fooled for a time, but
not after I thunk it over
But you're frontin' for him,
and that's all I wanna know
Where is he?
- I was fixin' to ask you that
- I done my part of that job
Now I'm waitin' for you fellas to do yours
You understand?
Mister, I'm gonna tell you the truth
I ain't got the first idea what you're talkin' about
I want my share I wanna know where
that money bag is You understand that?
No.
Then you'd better start remembering You're
gonna tell me before you leave this room
You mean you figure
I know where that money is?
I figure you better
Well, I don't know exactly what to say to that
Nobody else has to know
Just you and me Fifty-fifty
Mister, I swear I don't know
how you've lived as long has you have.
What do you mean?
- Do you remember Morgan Earp?
- Sure
He got his spine shot in two
He had his back to a door that had glass in it
Sure What about it?
If you look behind you,
you'll find just that kind of a door
That's the oldest one in the book
That glass is painted over and I know it
Maybe, but I sure wish
you'd give it a second thought
- I've had just about enough of this
- So have I
Hello, Leo
- Who's this?
- I don't know
- He's trying to pass himself off as Monte
- I know He's riding Monte's saddle
- What deal you making?
- I was trying to find out about things
- What things?
- I got a certain right to
To do what?
Sit here till I ride off
Then be someplace where I can find you
You understand?
Yeah
I wanna hear some more
about them rights you're so worried about
Let's go
- Me?
- Come on
Walk ahead of me until we're out in the street
Mount your pony
Mister, I'm obliged to you
for getting me out of that bar
Ride by my off-stirrup, close
- I ain't goin' that way
- You go the way I tell you to
I can't understand how in Sam Hill a tramp
like you found a way to kill Monte Jarrad
Get going
Stay where you are
- Now, look, I'm sick and tired
- I'm gonna smoke a cigarette
When I'm done, I'm gonna throw it away
When I throw it away, take care of yourself
Some friend of this belly-bustin' gunman,
I take it
- Say it while you can, tramp
- Figure you're good with a gun yourself
Outside of Monte,
I've never seen anybody better
All I meet today is champions
You shot Monte in the back
You wanna try again?
I aim to pull out of this fix
It ain't my squabble and there's no sense
in getting myself shot
- Monte Jarrad ain't dead
- Did he give you that saddle?
- No, he didn't, but his girl did
- What girl?
- Cherry de Longpre
- Did she kill him?
Ain't nobody killed him, you lunkhead
He got hurt bad and couldn't travel fast
I took his saddle as a favour to her,
to fool jackasses like you away from him
A full growed man like you could let a girl
talk him into a dang fool trick like that?
All I can say is here I am
I've heard some dumb stories in my time,
but that one really takes the cake
Get ready
All right
This don't make no sense to me
in any particular,
but let her go
Put 'em up, black hat
Higher
Take his gun, Melody
Like I told your friend, never turn your back
on anything, especially a woman
It's all right, George
- This the girl?
- Ain't she a lulu?
- Get off
- Just a minute, ma'am
If you're Cherry de Longpre,
you'll know I'm Leo Gledhill
How do you do, Mr Gledhill? Now get off
- I'm a friend of Monte Jarrad
- The lady said get off, Mr Gledhill
You jughead We been looking all over for you
Take Mr Gledhill for a walk out in the desert
Way out, and leave him
- Get!
- Leave him and do what?
Follow Melody to where you was headed
in the first place
You're gonna get out of this country
I'm gonna take you
- How do you like that for organisation?
- You know who I am
I don't know who you are,
only who you say you are
But that's who I am
You could be Luke Packard
who works for the express company
- Come on, Melody
- Yes, ma'am
Too bad, partner I know just how you feel
If there's anything in the world I like,
it's gettin' saved from bein' shot
# I wished I had a candy box
# To put my sweetheart in
# I'd take her out and kiss her twice
And put her back again
- # Round and round #
- Melody
You know, Monte'd kill a girl
if she done to him what I done to you
That's because Monte
don't understand women very well
I suppose you do?
Pa gave me a piece of advice
that ain't never failed me
"If you fool around a woman, hide a dollar
in your boot, then you'll come out with a dollar"
"That is," Pa says, "if you keep your boots on"
- What are you gonna do now?
- Tie up with George
Head toward Hot Creek
and work around there this winter
Will you be coming back this way in spring?
Maybe Don't like it much
down there in the summer
If you do, will you do something for me?
I don't like to seem impolite,
but after the way things been going,
I'd better listen to what it is first
I don't blame you
This money bag that Monte took,
when you come back, I want you
to give it back to the express company
- Can't
- You mean you won't?
- Don't know where it is
- I'm going to show you
It's in a little adobe house
Under the window sill, there's a slab
Under that there's a space
for a man to hide in if he can breathe
It's in there Monte told me
when it looked like he was gonna die
- Why don't we give it back to 'em now?
- We certainly will not
- Why not?
- Monte's gotta have his chance
They're looking for him
If that money popped up here,
they'd close in so tight
a jack rabbit couldn't get out
- We gotta wait till he gets away
- No, I'd better turn it in right now
You can't After promising me,
you wouldn't dare
Promised? When was that I promised?
Well
Well, you gotta promise now
- Oh, well
- Well, do you promise?
All right, I promise
Melody
I'm awful sorry I hope you understand,
and maybe someday you'll forgive me
Forget it
Ain't a thing in the world you've got
to worry about, as far as I'm concerned
If you ever do come back through here
I tell you, Cherry,
I'd like to see you again a whole lot
But I just don't seem to be cut out for the kind
of life you folks lead around these parts
Yeah, I see
- Good evening
- Luke Packard's the name
From the express company
Lift your hands just a little higher
And you, lady, step round the other side of him
I'd certainly be embarrassed
if you grabbed his iron and flung a shot at me
That's something
that's been worrying me most of my life
What would I do if a woman
hung the drop on me?
Boy, oh, boy
Over
These don't give much light to speak of,
but they'll warm it up while we wait
- Wait for what?
- The posse
- They're swinging around this way now
- Posse?
The sheriff and some of the boys
are heading up here
Go over in that corner
What they're aiming to do when they get here,
I couldn't say They didn't tell me
- But you can't do that
- No? Why can't I?
They'll kill him, not arrest him
Those Cotton boys won't let 'em
They're legal, lady Legal to the teeth
I ain't the one they're after
I ain't Monte Jarrad
I'm Melody Jones I ain't never set eyes on him
I ain't never seen
the gentleman in question myself
But this is Monte Jarrad's hideout
On information received,
this here girl is Monte Jarrad's lady friend
Monte Jarrad is well known to be a beanpole,
such as you be
When a posse makes a mistake,
it's mighty hard to unmake
Come, now Let's don't look on the dark side
What other side is there, mister?
If them Cottons get hold of me, I'm a dead duck
It ain't gonna be no good to say sorry
The fact is, I don't care a hoot
whether you're Monte Jarrad
or Melody Jones or Harmony Q Smith
All I'm interested in is 42,004 dollars
and 85 cents
belonging to the express company I work for
and not another cussed thing on earth
Once I get my hands on that,
you're as free as a bird
- Can I talk to this girl alone?
- Step in there if you want
- You trust me?
- 100 per cent
You'll never regret it, Mr Packard
You'd better take a light with you
Well, how do you like that?
He's no better than a cheat
I couldn't break my word in here if I wanted to
What did you wanna talk to me about?
Oh, yeah Say, what about this?
- What about what?
- About my gettin' hung over this money
- How far are you aimin' to carry this?
- You know the situation
You figure if I tell where the money is, it'll hurt
that belly buster's chances of gettin' away
But what about my neck?
You have to do what you think is right, of course
You gonna hang onto that promise
you trapped me into?
- I'm not gonna argue about it
- Maybe you're in love with him, but I ain't
This thing's gone just about far enough,
and ten feet further
Just as you please
- Made up your mind?
- Uh-huh
Well, where is it?
- Where's what?
- The money Stop stalling
What money was it?
You realise what you're doin'? That posse
ain't more than 30 minutes from here, Monte
- I ain't Monte
- I ain't got any way to force you
But I hate to see a man taken apart
without a chance to defend himself
- I'll tell you where it is
- What?
The money you're after Can't you keep
your mind on what we're talking about?
- If I tell you where it is, can we go?
- That was the proposition
- Which man do you aim to be the death of?
- Shut up
It's under that slab under the window
Well, what do you know about that?
Mister, you're a
Then you were telling the truth
Yeah
Look out for the fella doin' the shootin'
It's the real Monte He's after the money again
Is he dead?
Yeah
Shh
There's somebody out there
- Is that the way you always draw?
- You numbskull
I'm sorry, but I couldn't be sure who was in here
- Who is it?
- Packard, the express-company fella
Well, that sinks the duck
Now they got a "corpus delict"
- A what?
- A dead body
That's the way the law says it
If they've got a corpus, you're delict
Before this, we could have proved
there was a mistake
- Then why did you do it?
- We could have
- Do what?
- Shoot him
- Him?
- Why did you shoot him?
Why should I shoot the man,
a perfect stranger? Why should I?
Wait a minute
Both of you, you can't hang it on me
You was under the table with your gun smokin'
How do you account for that hole?
He ran outside, shot him, then came back in?
That's right
If it wasn't you,
we've got that belly buster back with us
Melody, we gotta
get outta this country and quick
- Ain't nothin' holdin' me back
- All right
But first you get the pony
Keep your eyes open
Maybe somebody's still out there
Don't you think
we oughta keep clotted together?
Stop trying to think Do as I say
All right
We got housekeeping to do before we leave
Give me a hand
Let's get this corpus into that box
Here, help cover up these spots
- You with us?
- You bet
Come on
Step back
You're under arrest
Light those candles, Kriendler
Let's see what's going on in here
Stick 'em up, fella
- I can't say I expected much more of you
- This him?
- Ain't it?
- Do I have to go through all that again?
Sheriff, he isn't Monte
He's just some guy that's got all mixed up
- Hold me Put me in jail
- You think I'm crazy?
They're prominent in this county, the Cottons
If I was to let him go,
they're as liable to string me up
Take it easy They'll be along any minute
If he ain't who they want, they won't touch him
Look, Sheriff, if they hang me,
how are you gonna find out
where the money is?
You know where the money is,
even if you ain't Monte?
- I do
- What ails you?
- Nothing
Just clearing my throat
Well?
- If I tell you, can I get outta here?
- If I was you
If he opens his mouth one more time,
knock him in the head
I give you my word The minute
that money's in my hand, that door's open
- It's right
Oh!
No!
That'll teach you
to keep your mouth shut
Come on
Come on?
Try any monkey business
and I'll blow you clear outta this house
Where's that money? You said
you knew where it is Let's have it, quick
- I'm afraid I changed my mind
- I'm giving you one more chance
Tell us, or do we have to get it outta you?
I don't think I got any suggestions
Get ahold of him Pin him
Anybody touches me
is gonna get their brains knocked out
You brush ape How did you think
you were gonna stop a man?
What are you doin' here?
Just lightin' a candle
Melody, why didn't you go?
I reached for you, but I couldn't find you
I couldn't leave you in all this mess
Maybe I can be as tough as this Monte Jarrad
Maybe a little bit tougher
- Let's get outta here
- They stampeded our horses
Well, what do you know?
For the last time, where's that money?
I forget
All right, put your guns away
and go to work on him
Don't knock his head clear off him
because he's gotta talk, and quick
You
You get over there
Get him
Whop him, Melody Whop him!
Get your hands off me
I got him
Wait a minute Bring him out here
Where is it?
Let him have it
Hold it We gotta try somethin' else
- Why?
- You'll knock him out, then what good is he?
- Want me to heat up his spurs?
- No, the way he said it, it's in this room
The way he said it, it must be
It's got to be
There's a stiff in here
Holy jumping Jupiter!
- It's Luke Packard
- Luke Packard?
It is Luke all right
Run for it
Hey!
Open this door!
Come on back!
Come back here and open this door!
Come back here!
Cherry? Cherry?
Cherry? Cherry?
Cherry? Cherry?
Monte's headed for the de Longpre range
Come on, let's go!
Cherry?
Cherry?
Cherry?
Hi
You can stop thinkin' what you're thinkin'
because you won't have time to throw that can
And you're too far for that Winchester
I thought you might be that Monte Jarrad,
but that can't be
- No?
- No
That weasel looks somethin' like I do
Fools people sometimes
Get over there
Take off that holster
And the boots
Don't think we look alike, hm?
I don't think I deserve people
to say anything like that about me
The jumper
It ain't gonna do you no good, you know
You don't think so?
Not even if we swapped every stitch.
'Cause there still wouldn't be
no scar on my face
But who'd know that if there wasn't no face left?
- Is that what you really aim to do?
- The pants
I didn't come lookin' for you
just to admire you, if that's what you mean
In that case, I guess I'd better fix you too
You ain't doin' this just because it suits you to
You got something else on your mind
Yeah?
Yeah But I ain't gonna help you with it none
I'm gonna make you ask about it
All right What about it?
- What about what?
- What about Cherry?
What about her?
You'll have to be clearer than that
- You know what I'm asking you
- Sure
But you're gonna have to ask it in plain words
- What were you doin' here the other night?
- If I don't tell you, you'll never know
- You'll tell me all right
- Will I?
Don't get smart I don't like it
And you won't like it either
What could you do
that you weren't gonna do already?
That's what I meant when I say
I'm gonna fix you too
I ain't gonna answer that question
I'm gonna leave you to worry about that
But she ain't yours no more
- You're lying
- You see?
That's what you're going to have to worry about
Was I lying or not?
With me gone, you'll never know
From now on, you'll have to
go on wondering about that,
for as long as you live,
which I don't figure to be very long
Come on
The hat
Know what you are now?
YOu're just an old used-to-be.
If you don't think so, ask her yourself
She's comin' in right now
You better get out to the barn
George is there He's hurt
Bad?
I think he's dyin'
All right, go on
Why did you shoot that old man?
He come asking for it Anytime somebody
comes asking for it, they're gonna get it
Found him in the gulch where you left him
Where you left him to die
You're wearin' his stuff
So the tramp was tellin' the truth
Monte, you were gonna kill him too
and leave him here to be buried as yourself
Get your dumb thumb out of my eye
- I was just trying to see if you were dead
- Well, I ain't
And I don't like somebody
trying to gouge my eye out
- Monte?
- Yeah I stumbled onto him up in the rocks
You can't, Monte
Look out, Melody! He's coming!
Take care of yourself, tramp
Take my gun, Melody Take it and drill him
Partner, you ain't got no gun
Get outta here They're comin'
Inside
- You two cover that door
- Yeah
Leo, the front door
- Come back here
- Stop me
- Look, Melody
- Sit down
Surrender in the name of the law!
- Take that horse and cut for it
- Why don't Monte go?
He can't race a horse
with that wound, but you can
She's right You can't do
no more damage around here
- No, I ain't goin'
- Why not?
Horse like that can't carry three people
Looks like we're gonna have company
- Did you get him?
- What for?
I ain't got anything against them fellas out there
- Get down You'll get your head shot off
- Why did you shoot?
He was shootin' too straight
George
Listen, George, only one thing
about this business still puzzles me
- What's that?
- What I'm doin' in it
You was gonna make somethin' out of yourself
- Don't you remember?
- That's right
You was gonna take Monte and be somebody
- That sounds kinda silly now, I reckon
All I'm askin' you now is,
tell me when you figure you is somebody
so we can get the heck
out of this shootin' gallery
Is that really why you stayed?
Well, not exactly
The truth is, I hadn't hardly got into
that idea good before I kinda got sick of it
Too jumpy to suit my taste
Why did you ride back into Payneville?
You was all tangled up in something
I couldn't rightly figure out what
No use tryin' to talk sense into your head
The only way to get you out
was for me to try to get inside
and bust open the whole shebang
It never occurred to me that maybe
you had reasons not to want to get out
Melody
What is it, Uncle Roscoe?
Where's my gun?
You ain't got no gun, George
You'd better give me one, Melody
If them fellas break in
you're gonna need some help
Here you are, George
Got it?
Yeah
Don't make out
you're worse off than you are, George
Here Drink some of this
We can't stand for this from nobody, George
- Hey, now
- That all you got? Four?
- What are you doin'?
- Nothin' you can stop, son
- Stop him, Avery!
- Come back here, you
I'm sorry
Hey, Monte Jarrad!
What about it?
What about it, Monte?
How about it, Monte?
M e eoedyyy, po eassse
I'm waitin'
Hey, men! Hold your fire!
Hold your fire! Let 'em shoot it out!
This one's for that scar on your face
You're walkin' too good
That one was a little too close
No face left, remember?
Thanks, partner
# I'm a poor lonesome cowboy
# I'm a poor lonesome cowboy
# I ain't got no sweetheart
# I'm a long way from home #
Come on You can bring your hat this time
# I ain't got no sweetheart
# I ain't got no sweetheart
# I'm a poor lonesome cowboy #
What a dumb town!
They catch you and then they don't hang you
They slung me in and they slung me out
- You still tryin' to make out you're bad off?
- Have you ever?
- What's this?
- Reward for drilling Monte
They held back 25 dollars for the doctor,
five dollars on a charge of vagrancy,
three weeks' rent for living in the jail
when I wasn't guilty
- Why are you givin' it to me?
- You brung him down
Me? I couldn't have brung down
a two-week-old baby
I was so dreamy, I couldn't hardly move,
let alone use a drilling iron
But you had to, George It wasn't me
That shot came straight from this barn
- Avery?
- Flat out
- Pop, maybe?
- No, I had his gun
This is awful, George Awful
Who do you care saved your life?
I'd let anybody save mine
- I'm givin' up
- Givin' up what?
Everything I ain't gonna make
no further fool of myself about her
- What in the Sam Hill are you talking about?
- She knowed him long before me
It was him or me, one or the other
She had a right
to shoot at whoever she wanted to
Melody, if you mean what I think you mean,
get outta my sight
- You ain't worthy for me to know
- I've been kiddin' myself too long
I know who she was aimin' at
Come in
Hello
- I was looking for my saddle
- Behind the curtain
What's that?
The reward
Oh
- I hoped you wouldn't take it like that
- I ain't blamin' you
It ain't no disgrace to be saved by a woman
What kind of a chump do you take me for?
You think I don't know who you were shootin' at?
- What?
- Look, Cherry
When a fella puts himself between a fella
and his girl, he's got to look out on both sides
- He's got to be ready
- You mean I was shootin' at you?
I ain't blamin' you You had to make
a quick pick which fella you wanted
I'm mighty glad
you ain't any better shot than you are
Thanks for takin' care of my saddle for me
Why, you you butter-fingered gun juggler
Melody
Cherry!
Hold it
When I aim at somethin', I hit it
And when I hit somethin', that's what I aimed at
Don't tell me she missed you all three times
- I've changed my mind, George
- What now?
I decided I don't wanna be sheriff
Well, that's a right smart decision
I'm thinking it's about time
I was thinking about settling down
A fella that knew about ranching
could make this dump into a nice place
- If he had a good foreman
- You ask her?
- Ask her what?
- For the job, you numpus
- You don't think I ought to go to Pop?
- Go away You disgust me
Well, if you think that's the way
Melody, stop it
Stop it, I tell you Stop
My goodness
You don't have to be so rough about it
