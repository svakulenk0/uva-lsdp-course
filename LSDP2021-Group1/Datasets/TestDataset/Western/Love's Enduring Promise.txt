Are you really here with me?
- I'm here.
- And you'll never leave me?
Never.
- Promise?
- Promise.
How can I be certain?
Because the two
shall become one.
What a wonderful life
you've given me, Clark.
What a wonderful life
we've made together.
Lord, we're grateful that the soil is warm
and ready to be planted.
And we ask that
this season's crop be bountiful.
We thank you
for this nourishment before us.
Bless it to our bodies
and bless this day. Amen.
Amen.
Hey, where's Missie?
"I thank you again and again for the honor
you've done me in your proposals...
"but to accept them
is absolutely impossible.
"I mean, my feelings
in every respect forbid it.
Hyah! Hyah!
And I think I'm old enough
to be riding by myself to school.
Charlie's a good horse, and he don't like
standing around all day with nothing to do.
How do you know
he don't like standing around?
- From Charlie.
- Hyah!
Hey. That was Missie...
on Charlie.
I believe it was.
Hyah!
Take your seats and get out
your reading primers.
Quickly, please.
All right. Daniel, please start reading
from the top of page 25.
Just makin' sure the teacher
made it here safely.
Well, here I am, safe and sound.
I would appreciate it, though, if you made
sure that Arnie and Aaron got here on time.
It's disruptive to the rest of the class
when they enter late.
Well, I think they're gonna be here
on time from now on.
You have a very nice day,
Miss Davis.
- All right, Daniel.
- Yes, ma'am.
Get on up. Ho.
- How you doin', Zeke?
- Gettin' by.
I just took the boys to school.
Late again.
I'll tell you, though,
I wish they'd stay young forever.
How old's that boy
of yours now?
He'll be 10
on his next birthday.
- And the younger one?
- Arnie? He's seven.
He's got it in his head, though,
that one of these days...
he and Aaron are going to swap places
and he's gonna be the older brother.
Yeah, well.
Boys sure are
full of big ideas.
Yeah.
Well, like you said...
boys are full of big ideas.
Lunch.
I was wondering if you'd
do me a favor, Clara.
I'm just not hungry today,
but I don't want my lunch to go to waste.
- Maybe you'd eat it for me?
- I'd like to help you, Miss Davis.
Thank you, Clara.
I'll be stepping out
for a few minutes.
Charlotte will be in charge
while I'm gone...
and she'll report to me the names of anyone
breaking any class rules in my absence.
Anyone.
Give the men a break for lunch.
I'll be back.
You're the boss.
All right, that's lunch.
Is this a private lunch
or can anyone dine here?
I hope I didn't startle you.
No.
I'm Grant Thomas.
Missie Davis.
Well, Missie Davis...
I have surveyed hundreds of miles of land
west of the Mississippi...
but today is the first time
I've ever seen anything as pretty as you...
in the viewfinder
of my transit.
I was picking berries.
Not a very substantial midday meal,
if you don't mind my saying so.
Did you say you have a transit?
Yes. It's a device used to
measure the...
Horizontal and vertical
angles of the land.
- That's right.
- And you have one close by?
Would you like to see?
- Would you like to look?
- Mm-hmm.
- Allow me.
- Thank you.
- That's amazing.
- Hmm.
What are you all doing here?
Follow me.
We work for the Continental Railroad Company.
It's our job to survey the lines...
to find the best and shortest routes
for the men who lay the tracks.
That's a Vernier solar compass.
It shows us which direction is true north.
I've read about equipment
like this.
I know you said
you're not hungry, but...
maybe you'd consider
joining me for lunch.
I'm sorry.
I really have to go. I'm late.
Late?
Thanks.
- Are you sure you have to go?
- I'm afraid so.
But it was nice to meet you,
and good luck with all your work here.
Let me in.
I know you're responsible for this,
Brian Murphy.
Get off this door.
I'm giving you one last chance.
Fine, have it your way.
I'm leaving and coming back with your pa.
I'm sorry. I assure you it isn't my desire
to startle you every time we meet.
No. It's fine.
I was just about to go in and teach a class.
I'm the teacher.
Well, I don't mean to hold you up,
but you left this.
Thank you.
I understand now why you couldn't
accept my invitation for lunch.
So maybe you'll accept my next invitation
to dine with me for lunch?
A week from Saturday?
It's not a school day.
- Unless you have a steady beau.
- No.
- No, you won't dine with me?
- No. I mean, no, I don't have a steady beau.
- Oh.
- Yes. I would be delighted to dine with you.
Wonderful. I hear the hotel dining room
has the best food in town.
I could arrange
for transportation.
Oh, no. That's all right.
I'll meet you there.
- Around noon?
- Noon would be perfect.
Better get back to my class.
All right. Good-bye.
Good-bye.
And this handsome and mysterious stranger
rides up on this mighty steed...
and sweeps me off my feet.
- Missie Davis, you are making that up.
- I'm not.
It really happened. His name's Grant Thomas,
and he works for the railroad.
- On the crew?
- Yes, but he's different from the other men.
I mean, he was well-dressed
and self-assured.
They treat him
like he was the boss.
He even had his own tent
filled with food.
Looks like you're imagining
a little more than just food.
He invited me
to dine with him at the hotel.
- He said "dine"?
- Yes.
- What'd you say?
- I said yes.
Pa, when you gonna let me do
the choppin' and you do the loadin'?
- When you get older.
- That's what you said about the plowin'.
Well, that's right. You're gonna be
a big help with the plowin' someday.
- But I wanna help now.
- You are helping me.
But I wanna do important work.
A man's work.
There's all kinds of work, Son.
There's a boy's work.
There's a man's work,
and there's God's work.
It's all important.
- So feeding the chickens is important?
- Yep.
- And cleaning the pig's pen?
- Oh, you bet.
Um, Pa, I gotta go.
- Go ahead.
- Be right back, Pa. Be right back to help.
Okay.
Whew.
Aaron.
Aaron, are you hurt?
Seen 'em trapped
lots of times, Pa...
but I ain't never heard
one do that till now.
It scared me so bad, Pa.
I don't need to pee no more.
You all right, Pa?
Come here.
I need you to take off your belt...
I need you to take off your belt
and wrap it around my leg.
Oh. Come on.
There you go.
What do I do again, Pa?
Wrap it around
above my knee. Tight.
Pa, help me. I don't know what to do.
It's not your fault.
Pa.
Please, Pa.
Don't leave me.
Please, Pa.
Hyah.
Hyah.
Whoa. Whoa.
Hello.
Hyah.
Oh, my God. Ma-Mama!
- Mama!
- What?
Come quick.
Oh, God. Oh, God.
The bleeding has stopped for now.
No moving around, Clark.
Uh-uh.
Need to give that wound
a chance to heal.
- For how long?
- At least a few weeks. Maybe more.
That's a serious injury.
Gash goes clear to the bone.
I'll see you out.
Thanks, Doc.
- How's Pa?
- He's resting.
Thank you
for coming so quickly.
It takes me a better part
of a month to do my rounds...
but I'll be back
to check on him then.
I'll make sure
he stays in bed.
Infection.
That's your biggest worry now.
A bad infection
could lead to gangrene.
He could lose his leg.
Or worse.
Dear Lord,
you've healed the lame.
Please.
Please help this good man.
Give us the strength
to endure this.
He will.
He will.
That look of worry on your face,
it hurts a lot more than this leg does.
I'm fine.
I'm right here.
I know, but...
I'm right here, Marty.
I'm not going anywhere.
And I'm figuring that, uh...
A couple of days,
I'm gonna be right as rain.
You can't work the fields, Clark.
I have to.
If we don't get a good crop this year,
we're gonna lose everything.
I know.
That's why Missie and I
will do it.
You can't.
We will.
Pa's asleep.
Go on and eat your lunch.
- I wanna stay here with Pa.
- I'll be right here with him.
Pa needs me.
Whoa.
- Thank you.
- Here you go, sir.
- Mm-hmm. Thank you.
- Looks good.
Whoa.
Lunchtime.
Oh, no. Saturday.
What is it?
What's wrong?
I'm just redressing the wound.
Can you hand me that canister of yeast?
Elm bark and yeast?
This should make it all better.
And if it doesn't?
Oh, God. Please, God.
Help my pa.
Whoa. Whoa.
Afternoon.
I think this belongs to you.
You're the man
that helped bring my pa home.
How is he?
He's alive.
How did you
happen upon him?
I was out checking my traps.
What do you think
you're doing?
I thought I might
have a turn at the plow.
Why are you helping me?
Well, wait a minute.
What's your name?
Nate.
I thought maybe
we'd met before.
I don't think so.
Got, uh, Anders and Malone working
on the next quarter-mile like you asked.
I'm glad someone
is where they're supposed to be.
Yeah. I know it's
none of my business, boss...
but maybe the lady had a good reason
for standing you up.
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.
- So, you've handled a plow before.
- Yep.
Are you from around here?
- Here and there.
- Just passing through?
You always ask
so many questions?
Just wondering
on your work experience.
'Cause it seems to me you should be
spacing the rows a little closer together.
Because the more rows you plow, the more seeds
I can plant and the bigger the harvest is.
Do I tell you how to
braid your hair?
Don't tell me
how to plow a field.
How is he, ma'am?
Mind if I take a look?
There's some water in the bowl.
Missie, could you...
Best if your boy
wasn't in here.
Aaron, Pa needs fresh water.
- Missie can.
- No, I want you to get it.
No, Mama.
I'm not leaving Pa.
Pa will be all right.
We're here to see to that.
- Right now I want you to...
- I'm not going! No!
- Aaron.
- No.
- Go and get fresh water.
- I'm not leaving.
- Pa needs me.!
- Hand me that chair.
He needs me in there, Mama.
Let me in.
What didn't you want him
to hear?
We're gonna have to open that wound
and burn it clean.
It's the only way
to get rid of the infection.
- I thought the elm bark would help dry it out.
- Mama, please.
or his life if you let
the infection get worse.
Have you ever done
this sort of thing before?
Been a ranch hand for years.
Seen a lot of mishaps.
So I've taken care
of my share of accidents.
Mama. Can't we just
wait for Doc?
The doc won't be around
for another three weeks.
What do you need?
Take my knife and clean it
with whatever you got. Brandy or iodine.
I'm gonna need
some hot coals and a fry pan.
Be best if you took
your brothers out of earshot.
I love you, Pa.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa.
Appreciate it.
The fever broke.
He's awake.
He's even hungry.
He's asking for my fried chicken.
Make sure you thank him
and invite him for supper tonight.
I will. Nate.
Whoa. Whoa.
Whoa. Whoa.
Thank you... for everything.
Just glad I was there.
Especially wouldn't wantin'
your brother watching his pa die...
then living a life wondering
what he could've done different.
Well, I hope you like fried chicken.
That's what
we're having for supper.
I'm hungry.
You hear my stomach growl here?
We're all hungry.
We've been waiting all day.
- Who do you think cooked it?
- Come on. Who cooked it?
- I cooked it of course.
- Who put the on this chicken?
- The what?
- It's my favorite.
He's here.
Can we start eating?
- Patience.
- Nate, come on in.
We're having a picnic.
We made you a plate.
Pa's leg is getting better, Nate.
And I'll be right here to make sure
you have everything you need, Pa.
Like if you need water... or biscuits.
Or someone to get you a piece of ham.
- Or your Bible.
- How 'bout you get me some help with the chores?
- Pa needs me.
- All right, you two. Let's say the blessing...
so we can eat this fine meal
that your mama has prepared.
Lord, we thank you for the blessings
that you've bestowed on this family.
My family. And to Nate...
who has reopened our eyes
to your enduring promise.
- Amen.
- Amen.
- Eat up.
- All right.
Oh.
Marty tells me that you've done
more work in that field today...
than she and Missie
have been able to do all week.
Well, it wasn't
my first time behind a plow.
You got your own
piece of land?
Uh, no. No land yet.
Just plans.
Never despise meager beginnings.
Got some wheat and corn...
needs to get in the ground...
next couple of weeks.
I'll pay you fair price
soon as the crop comes in.
But Missie here,
she's young and able...
and I'm sure she'd be happy to
help you with the planting.
I'll be out there at sunup.
All right.
- He has a big mouth.
- You better watch out. He might get ya.
What I won't give
for a handful of quiet.
Do a bear.
- He has a big mouth.
- Better watch out. He might get ya!
Cut your hair for two bits.
Actually, I'm not here for a haircut.
I just need a little information.
Information's two bits.
I'm looking for a young woman...
a Missie Davis.
I can tell you just where
to find the Davis place.
I'd be most appreciative.
You wanna head back out of town.
Go south from the post office.
- Get to two big oak trees. Head west.
- Head west.
- You can't miss it.
- Thank you very much.
Sometimes when
I'm outside like this...
surrounded by all this beauty...
it feels like I'm walking through
one of God's paintings.
Feeds my soul.
Speaking of God...
what did your Pa mean by
"His enduring promise"?
That someday
he'll wipe away all our tears...
and that all pain and suffering
and heartache will be gone.
That evening when
we were all together...
feeling joyful that Pa
wasn't in pain...
you helped give us
a glimpse of that promise.
We have plenty of wood
back at the cabin.
Not a sturdy piece of oak
like this one.
What's it for?
Are you all right?
Crazy.
You're foolish
to mess with bees.
I've done this
plenty of times.
Smoke puts 'em to sleep.
We'll surprise your mama
with some honey.
Ouch. Hey, ouch!
What's the matter?
One of the bees not sleepy?
What about the honey for Mama?
I'd, uh, stop talking
and start running if I were you.
Oh.
Come here.
That was close.
Smoke puts 'em to sleep.
- It's always worked before.
- Well, throwing a rock at 'em didn't help either.
No. Oh, no.
- What is it?
- My locket.
- It's gone... It can't be gone.
- Missie.
My mama gave it to me.
Come on.
I can't believe it.
Someone you know?
Someone I never thought
I'd see again.
Good afternoon, Missie.
Good afternoon, Grant.
I was worried when you didn't
show up at the restaurant.
It took every bit of
my surveying equipment to find you.
Actually, I hope you don't mind, but I took
the liberty of asking around in town.
I had planned to be there.
My pa had an accident and was quite ill.
- Is he all right?
- He's still recovering...
but I think the worst
is behind him.
Well, I'm so glad.
This is Nate. He's been working
for my pa since his accident.
We had a mishap with some bees.
I'm a mess.
A beautiful mess.
If you don't mind my saying so.
Would you like to meet my folks?
I mean, my pa might be sleeping, but...
Well, I don't wanna disturb them
with this unannounced visit.
But if it's all right, I'd like to come back and
do things the right and proper way.
- Things?
- Yes.
I'd like to ask his permission to court
his daughter, if that's all right with you?
Yes. That would be fine
with me.
Then I'll look forward to my next conversation
with him when he's feeling up to it.
It's nice to meet you, Nate.
I'll see you soon.
All right, John.
Mama sent me to get you.
She's got supper ready.
I'm not real hungry.
- But thank her for me anyway.
- All right.
- I could bring you something for later.
- No.
But you, uh... you can do
something for me.
Give this to your pa.
He's gonna need it to get around.
A sturdy piece of oak.
I know how much
he'll appreciate it.
Good night.
Whoa. Whoa.
Good to see you up.
I just wanted to thank you
for making this fancy cane for me.
- Mighty thoughtful of you.
- I know what a chore it can be to get around at first.
You had some experience
with a bum leg yourself?
My pa.
He needed a cane for months.
Best if I get
the horses brushed and fed.
All right then.
How was your walk?
Felt good to get out for a while.
Thanks to you.
I went back to that spot in the woods
where I had my accident.
Woods are nice and green
this time of year.
Yep. Fella could get lost
in those trees if he wanted to.
How long have you known?
Boy does a lot of growing and changing
in his teen years.
When you told me about your pa's leg,
well, that kind of confirmed it for me.
My middle name's Nathan.
Nate.
Been using it for years 'cause I thought if
I changed my name I could change my past.
Hmm.
How's that
working out for you, son?
Most days it seems like
the past is breathing down my neck...
reminding me I'm Willie.
Even in a roomful of folks
who call me Nate.
Your family
had a lot to deal with...
and it must've been awful hard.
When a tragedy...
happens...
a real family pulls together.
I mean, mine ripped apart.
My ma, she...
grieved herself crazy,
and she went back East.
My pa, he just quit.
So I left home six years ago.
I imagine you got your reasons
for coming back now.
I got some things
that need to be said.
Then I came close to going home,
and I couldn't face my pa.
Not after I left like I did.
And then you found...
Aaron and me.
Yes, you did.
I don't know what happened
between you two.
I do know you're never going to step out of
the shadow of your past until you see him.
Did you...
Did you tell him about me?
That's not up to me.
He probably doesn't even
wanna see me.
I saw a man
with a face full of regret.
Seeing you.
Talking to you.
That might help him
put his past to rest.
I suppose you think I'm a coward
for running the way I did.
The way a man grieves,
that's a personal thing.
But I do know
there are times...
when a man can be driven
to take a trip in search of answers.
And if that man doesn't find
the answer he's looking for?
Most often we're not looking for answers.
We're in need of comfort.
And for me, the only trip worth taking
is when I kneel to pray.
All the comfort I could ever ask for
is right there.
You'll be fine, son.
Oh, yes. Of course.
What's your business here?
Pa, it's me, Willie.
Oh, my.
I guess you would be old enough
to have whiskers by now.
Yes, sir.
I'm gonna make some coffee.
You want a cup?
I found your parents to be
very gracious about our lunch together.
Back East, young women must often
be accompanied by a chaperone.
Mothers and sisters are too busy
with their tasks of the day...
to spend time chaperoning.
If you don't mind
my saying so, Mr. Thomas...
that your family's bringing the railroad
right past our doors.
Glad to hear we have the support
of the community.
Oh, um, the cook is preparing that special
chicken dish that you requested.
Well, whenever you're ready
for your first course, just signal me.
- Very good.
- I thought you were a surveyor.
I am. When your family
owns the business...
it's only smart to know
every aspect of it.
I hope you find everything
to your satisfaction.
Well, everything's so lovely...
the table linens, the crystal,
the beautiful Aubusson china.
- You know the pattern?
- Her Majesty's Filigree.
See, the scroll designs along the rim
give it elegance...
and the raised accents
make it unique.
I spend an exorbitant
amount of time reading.
Hey! Hey!
- I believe that's our lunch.
- Pardon. Sorry, sir.
Excuse me.
I'm terribly sorry.
Here you go, sir.
- A connoisseur of knowledge
and a chicken-wrangler.
The advantage of being raised in the West
and educated by a woman from the East.
Um, my mother died
when I was just a child...
and my father ended up
marrying a woman from the East.
Oh, no!
Oh, I'm so clumsy.
No, no. Not at all.
Missie. No, Missie.
- I know they're expensive. I can pay him back.
- Missie. Missie.
The crystal is mine...
as are the plates.
They are easily replaced.
Now sit.
- They're yours?
- I wanted the table to be perfect...
so I had my man, John,
bring them over this morning.
Don't worry another moment. I have 20 more
crystal glasses just like that one at home.
- Twenty more.
- Yes.
And I would happily let you
crack each and every one...
if you'll dine with me
Maybe next time we'll have
to have a picnic instead.
You can leave
all your crystal at home.
I'm already
planning the menu.
This is potatoes
with scrambled eggs.
Just like you always
used to have.
Oh, that wasn't me.
That was Matt...
Mattie.
I hate to waste good food.
You know, Pa,
I could probably eat some of this.
Just don't do me
any favors, Willie.
It ain't gonna break my heart
if you don't eat the eggs.
Really, Pa,
I could eat some of that.
Well, you're gonna
eat nothin' now.
I mean, six years since
I seen or heard from you.
I guess I'm entitled
to forget a few things.
Oh, Pa.
I'm sorry I left like I did.
Well, at least your ma
had the guts...
to tell me to my face
she was leavin'.
- You know what happened to her?
- No.
Then I guess
you're a lot like your mama.
Well, I'm here now.
I came back
to set things right.
- I hope you could...
- What can I do? I could pretend none of this ever happened?
I'm not asking you
to pretend nothin', Pa.
- I'm asking you to forgive me.
- You want me to forgive you?
Maybe you should forget
you still have a son.
- Yes. We'll take three of those, okay?
- Yes.
Yes, please.
That will be fine.
We'll try these ones.
You make him sound like a fictional hero
from one of your novels.
Grant is educated...
and handsome...
attentive.
He's traveled all over
for his job...
and seen places
I've only read about.
Just remember...
that God has written
his own story for you.
And it's not the feelings of your heart
that it should be based upon...
but... rather the thoughts of your heart
that you need to hear...
that inner voice
that tells you...
that this man will care for you
no matter what...
that he'll still want to kiss you
when you're old and gray...
tend to you when you're sick,
honor you.
And if the thoughts of my heart say yes,
he is the one?
Then you should trust your instincts
and pledge your heart to him...
because a man like that
is as rare as a diamond in the rough.
Like Pa.
Yes. Like your pa.
Aaron said he saw you
packin' up your horse.
You plannin'
on goin' somewhere?
Took your advice.
I saw my pa.
I figured
that's where you were.
According to him,
I ruined his life.
I'm sorry that it didn't work out
the way you hoped, Willie.
I really thought your father was ready
to make amends with you.
He'll never be ready
to do that.
He'll never forgive me.
You're his son.
Not anymore.
You wanna talk about it?
Talkin' about it
don't change anything.
Sometimes,
just talkin' it through...
it'll help you see things
in a whole different light.
There ain't no light in the world
that'd make this better.
Can't hurt to try.
Unless you're afraid.
I used to set traps for Pa.
Mattie was always after me
to let him come along.
I didn't want him to.
I just figured he'd slow me down.
I didn't want him to.
I just figured
he'd get in the way.
But Mattie had a way
about him.
He knew just how to get Ma and Pa
to let him have his way.
When are we gonna
set the first trap, Willie?
When I find the right place.
- When are we gonna eat the food Mama sent?
- When we get hungry.
How do you know when
it's the right time for the traps?
Can't you hush up
for just two seconds?
I can't concentrate
with you yammering on and on.
on gettin' those traps...
set so Pa would know...
what a good trapper
I really was.
Thinkin' back,
I don't know how I couldn't see...
how tired and worried
Mattie was.
I'm cold, and it's getting dark.
Don't you think
we'd better head back?
I got one more trap to set.
Mama's gonna be worried.
Hush. Gotta make
this last trap count.
Pa's dependin' on me.
One minute, I could see
where I was goin'...
and the next minute
it got so dark...
I couldn't make out
the right way to go.
I'm so sorry, Mattie.
I should have listened to you.
There's no way I can
get us home in the dark.
May-Maybe Pa
will come find us.
Maybe. More than likely,
we'll just have to wait out the night...
set out home at first light.
I'm awful cold, Willie.
Here. Stay close to me,
and I'll...
I'll keep you wa-warm.
Thanks, Willie.
"Thanks, Willie. "
The kid was shiverin' and shaking
in the cold, and he says thanks.
Then what happened?
Then...
Then he, uh...
You know.
I was right.
Talkin' about it
doesn't change anything.
Plowin's about done.
I think it's time I moved on.
- I did what I came for.
- Did you?
Came home, saw my pa.
Are you sure that's who
you really needed to face?
I should be on my way.
Our doors will always
be open to you, Willie...
and our prayers
will be with you.
Hah.
Hah.
Hah.
Mattie, wake up.
Come on, Mattie.
Quit foolin'.
Mattie?
No. Mattie.
Mattie, come on.
Come on, Mattie.
Wake up. No.
Mattie!
Mattie! No!
Mattie.
No. Mattie.
Mattie.
It was my fault, Mattie.
I was supposed to protect you,
and I didn't.
I didn't want it to happen.
You slipped away,
and I didn't even know.
You were so brave,
and I didn't even get to tell you.
I'm sorry, Mattie.
Please forgive me.
- After you.
- Thank you.
Grant.
I've never seen anything like it.
It's just like a real home.
It is my home.
The tent goes up
wherever I am.
I don't see any purpose
in depriving myself...
of the comforts
I've become accustomed to.
You travel
with all these books?
Books... and music.
Honor me with a dance.
- You're an excellent partner.
- Thank you. My father taught me.
Missie, I...
I'm not generally a man who thinks much
past the next site I'm working...
but, since we've met, I've found myself
daydreaming about a future with you.
What do you see for us
in your dreams?
Well, I see us traveling
and exploring together.
Midnight picnics under a canopy
of the brightest stars...
or dining in the finest hotels.
A life brimming with anything
and everything you could ever want.
That life sounds like
a fairy tale.
That life could be ours.
You would never have to
turn a spade in soil again or...
or toil at planting
your own food.
And if I did have
to plant and plow...
do you see yourself
right there beside me?
You're missing my point.
I wouldn't have to be there...
because no wife of mine
would ever struggle...
I'm a very wealthy man.
What's wrong?
I just always thought my first kiss
should be for the man I marry.
Then marry me.
Missie, you don't want
to say no to a man...
who's offering to save you
from a life of adversity.
I'm saying no to a man
who doesn't think adversity...
is something
to get through together.
It's just not real, Grant.
I'll tell you what's real.
You've just given up
the chance of a lifetime.
I can have any heart I want.
Until now.
I'm sorry, Grant.
I'll get someone
to take you home.
God bless you.
Nate. Hi.
Actually, I'm Willie...
Nathan LaHaye.
- Willie LaHaye.
- You were the boy...
that stole my hair ribbons
and dipped my braids in ink.
And then when your brother...
And then you were gone.
So, why didn't you tell me
who you were?
I've been Nate for years
to strangers.
Guess I wasn't ready
to be Willie again...
un-until now.
Well, you don't look
like anything I remember.
Oh. I was just a boy
when I left.
It's been a while.
People change.
They do.
Well, how about your Pa?
Have you seen him?
I've seen him...
but he's not ready
to see me.
Well, you know, I wanted to thank you
for all you did for my family...
but you... you left
without saying good-bye.
Had some thinkin' to do,
some things to get right.
I'm grateful to you
and your family...
for helping me
put down a burden...
that I've been carryin'
for a long time.
Actually, I'm...
I'm headed for the West.
You've got land to farm?
No. Not yet.
When I do claim my land...
it'll be for raising cattle,
not crops.
I worked on a couple cattle ranches,
and it's what suits me.
The thing is,
I came by today...
because I didn't want
to make the same mistake.
I wanted to see you
and, um...
and give these back to you.
My ribbons.
You kept them all these years?
Probably seems silly to you.
No, not silly.
It's sweet.
Well, anyway,
that's what I came for...
to give you those and...
to say good-bye.
Bye.
Never despise meager beginnings.
Wait!
Willie.
Willie.
I was just wondering
if, um...
Are cattle ranchers tied to the seasons
the same way farmers are?
No, not in the same way,
I suppose.
So, would it make a difference
if you leave now or leave later?
I guess not.
After all the work you did
plowing and planting our fields...
it would be a shame for you to miss
the harvest and not collect your pay.
And I make really good
corn bread pudding...
once the sweet corn's shucked.
I'll bet that fella Grant Thomas
will really like that.
Yes, I bet he will...
if he finds someone
to make it for him.
It won't be me.
I guess I could postpone my trip
long enough to be here for the harvest.
Good.
They named him Big Earl.
Big Earl, he...
Dear Father, we thank you
for this harvest...
for your faith in us...
and for the time
we spend together.
- Amen.
- Amen.
All right,
pass your bowls down.
You workin' hard?
Tryin' to.
All right, you two.
You know what's expected.
- Ah.
- Go ahead. Get on up there.
I love you, Missie Davis.
I always have.
I love you too.
Missie Davis,
will you marry me?
- Try and send word as soon as you're settled.
- I will.
And walk as much as you can.
It's better than riding.
You know
how much we love you.
I know it's not so far,
but send word once you're settled.
I'll take good care of her.
I know you will.
You take good care
of both of you.
Ever since you were
just a little baby...
I knew this moment would come.
You always had
an independent spirit.
Pa. My heart's breaking.
Mine too.
- Can you fix it?
- Not this time, little one.
Not this time.
You go ahead now.
Your husband's waitin' on you.
Thank you.
Remember His promise.
No tears.
No tears.
No tears.
