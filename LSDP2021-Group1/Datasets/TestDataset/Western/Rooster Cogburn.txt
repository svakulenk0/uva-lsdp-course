It's the law, Pecos!
We want you for the robbery of
the Katy Flyer, murder of the engineer.
- Get your hands on top of your heads...
-
You bastard!
You bastards!
Rooster J. Cogburn,
please step forward.
Are you Deputy Marshal
for the U.S. District Court...
for the western district
of Arkansas,
having criminal jurisdiction
over the Indian Nation?
You know I am.
Rooster, any deputy
who shoots and kills...
in eight years...
is breaking the law,
not aiding and abetting it.
Let's get this straight, Judge.
Only 60 of 'em died.
None was shot
but in the line of duty...
or in defense of my person
or fleein' justice!
You have been in the service
of this court for almost two lustrums.
You're a strong man,
and you're a brave man.
And you have, at times, executed
your duties faithfully and well.
- But all too often you have
acted with excessive zeal...
- What is a "lustrum," Judge?
- Five years. Don't interrupt me.
- Yes, sir.
- Pay attention to me.
- Yes, sir!
- This is not another formal reprimand.
- Yes, sir!
People with money go where they're
protected by the law, not shot by it!
Is that the kind of law
my deputy got yesterday?
I was proud to tell his wife
I shot his killers.
It seems you cannot serve the papers
of this court and effect arrests...
without breaking heads
and spraying bullets about.
The West is changing,
and you haven't changed with it.
I want your badge.
Out there in the territory, they don't
know about all these newfangled laws.
We know, but they don't. They're still
shootin' in the same direction: At me!
Your badge, Cogburn.
You've let yourself go,
Rooster.
Look at your belly.
You can't even close your coat over it.
- You drink too much.
- I ain't had a drink since breakfast,
and I only wear this coat
in your court.
It was always good enough
when you needed what was in it.
You've gone to seed, Rooster.
Gone to seed.
Next case.
Whoa!
Lieutenant, the road's out ahead.
Rock slide.
- Can we get around it?
- No, sir.
But, uh, there's a shallow downriver.
Get the wagon across.
Column right, ho!
Whoa!
Breed, we can't move nitro
over those logs.
It's just dead wood, sir.
It's easy to move.
Shipley, Grimm, dismount.
Start movin' those logs!
Rawlins, Bryant, get the ropes.
Help 'em!
-
-
The war is over.
- The U.S. Cavalry lost again!
- Just like I told you.
- Give me my money.
- Don't you trust me?
Pay up, Hawk. You'll try takin'
the gold without me.
Don't tempt me.
Any fool can blow nitro.
The last fool that thought that
blowed himself up provin' it.
All right, move, fast.
We got four days hard ridin'.
That gold shipment won't wait.
Gone to seed, have I?
Gone to seed! A man does his job,
defends the code.
What does he get
out of it?
- Disgrace and abuse!
- Judge say you abuse justice.
I abuse justice?
There ain't no justice
in the West no more.
Men with sand in their craws
being pushed aside by...
duded-up Yankee lawyers who
won spellin' bees back home!
- That ain't St. Louis beer.
- Kansas City.
Well, I don't like it.
Neither does Sterling.
-
- Too sweet, ain't it, General?
- Well, gimme my jug.
-
Judge Parker say lock it up.
Who's payin' the rent
around here, him or me?
You can't lock up
a man's whiskey!
You like that joss stick
holder over there.
- Give you one minute to get my whiskey.
- Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
I'll get it
for you!
Don't shoot until you've heard
what I've come to say.
You have said enough, Judge.
- None of it to my credit nor likin'.
-
May I sit and take a drink with you
and General Sterling Price?
- If you don't mind such seedy company.
-
Rooster...
You were once the best marshal I had,
and you could be again.
That account is long overdrawn.
Come now, old friend, let's
let bygones be bygones.
I have a most important
assignment for you.
You seem to forget, Judge.
You hung up my guns, remember?
I am retired,
relieved,
and rejoicin'!
~ I painted her
I painted her ~
~ Up her belly
and down her back ~
~ In every crack ~~
Chen Lee,
turn off the light.
No doubt you've heard
of Hawk's latest outrage.
Now the Army believes that nitro
was taken to commit another robbery.
Now the time's short.
You know the territory, and you know
the scout who set up the ambush.
- Breed? He run with Hawk now?
- Mmm. Mm-hmm.
Well, he's the best scout I ever had.
Good friend too.
He never done a wrong thing till
he killed that Wells-Fargo agent...
and run away with the payroll
we were guardin'.
We need a man
with grit, Cogburn.
- The government'll be mighty
grateful if you bring Hawk in.
- How grateful?
For the return
of the dynamite, $500.
- For Hawk, 1,500.
- Now...
- that is information more to my liking.
- I thought it would be.
Now, I want him alive.
I want him to answer to me, not to you.
- Then we'll see about your badge.
- Well, I may have to charge you
my retirement rates.
That is double salary, double expenses.
Can you afford me?
- Rates are noted and accepted.
-
A group of my deputies
will act as your posse,
but it's going to take a while
to get organized.
Take a while?
It’ll take a miracle!
Them lily-livered lawbookers
ain't gonna risk their necks,
- or you wouldn't be here.
- You'll need this.
Do the job and it's yours
again, permanently.
Well, it goes
against my grain, but...
I'll ride
at first light.
-
- Drunken cat.
That's right, Judge, in spite of the
fact that you locked up our whiskey!
You tell them deputies to meet me
at Bagby's, if you can find any.
Well, see who they have to come to
when they got a real job to be done?
The old rat killer.
Well, I'll be in fine feather tomorrow.
- Probably got another lustrum in me.
- What is lustrum?
Five years, you Chinaman.
That's the worst of you people.
You come over here, we give
you all the help we can.
- You won't even learn our language.
-
Maybe you're right.
~~
Whoa!
You gonna unhook 'em?
Here you are, sweet lady.
How you doin', little darlin'?
- ~~
-
~~
~ I, in my Savior
am happy and blessed ~
~ Watching and waiting
Looking above ~~
Come, come.
Quickly, quickly!
Hurry! Hurry!
Hurry!
Go as fast as you can.
Wolf. Wolf.
Watch. Go. Go.
- They're settlers passing through.
- No, they're not settlers.
Come, child.
Come. Come.
Welcome
to Fort Ruby.
I am the Reverend
George Goodnight,
and this is
my daughter, Eula.
We offer you the hospitality of our
settlement. We are God's servants here.
We must ask you not to sell
ardent spirits...
or guns
to the Indians.
It is against the civil law
and against the laws of God.
This is the law
we go by, sister,
so don't waste your preachin'
tryin' to convert us.
Please do not strip these
people of their dignity with liquor...
and your worldly ways.
- We beg you.
- Here, for your collection plate.
Now, you leave us be.
We're gonna camp here, rest our horses,
take our pleasures as we please...
with no more preachin'
from God's servants.
A brand
from the burning.
What's that you say?
Our work, sir, is to pluck brands
from the burning.
If you wouldn't be plucked yourself, you
can at least show us common courtesy.
I do believe you're better at cluckin'
than you are at pluckin'.
You're an unpleasant
sort of fellow.
I'm the boldest sinner
on the Arkansas River, little lady.
I do just as I please,
and I make people remember me.
Only evil can come
of your presence, sir.
Temptation is the spawn
of the devil.
- You callin' me a devil, mister?
- You do the devil's work.
I'd shoot a man of the cloth or a lady
just that easy, so don't provoke me.
I'm not afraid. I wear God's armor.
I do not fear what man can do to me.
I do not fear a skunk.
I simply do not care for his odor.
I'm warnin' you.
You have ridden the Hoot Owl Trail
and tasted the fruits of evil,
but justice will catch up
with you to demand payment.
The Lord is my Shepherd.
I shall not want.
He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.
He leadeth me beside the still waters.
He restoreth my soul.
He leadeth me in the paths
of righteousness for His namesake.
-
- Yea, though I walk through
the valley of the shadow of death,
- I will fear no evil...
-
- For Thou art with me.
- Enough of your Sunday school lessons!
- Out of my sight, both of you!
- Thy rod and Thy staff, they comfort me.
Thou preparest a table before me
in the presence of mine enemies.
My cup runneth over.
Surely goodness and mercy
shall follow me all the days of my life.
And I will dwell
in the house of the Lord.
- She put the fear of God in you, Hawk?
-
- Rooster, welcome.
- Bagby.
Good to have you back
in the territory.
- Huntin' trip?
- You might say. Big game.
- The Hawk. You seen him?
- He went through here yesterday.
With a wagonload of heavy cargo.
Had nine men with him.
- Oh? Which way did they go?
- Fort Ruby way.
The Winding Stair Mountains. Took
the old trail out of Webber's Falls.
Fort Ruby? Last time I heard of that,
it was just a memory.
There's still a settlement
there, mostly Indians.
Run by a Yankee preacher named
Goodnight and his daughter.
I helped build a church there.
Judge Parker's
promised me a posse.
Now, when it gets here, if it gets here,
you send 'em on after me.
I ain't waitin'
for them dandelions.
Why don't you rest
and have some of Winona's stew?
Oh, I'd love to, Winona,
but the trail's too hot.
I had my druthers, I'd just pull a cork
and jaw with you all night. So long.
See you later.
He wants a drink.
Give him a drink.
Can you drink this?
He can have a drink.
- Give me that stuff.
- He's thirsty.
There's gonna
be trouble.
You want some? Come on, take a drink.
Here, have a drink.
- See that? He's thirsty.
- Oh, you want it?
- Want a drink? Here.
- I want him to drink every last drop.
Come on,
make him drink it.
-
- No, Father.
-
-
Hey, hitch them horses!
Watch that nitro!
- Hitch up the wagon!
-
Jerry,
hitch up that wagon!
Marinda, go out,
out into the fields.
Jerry, get that wagon hitched!
Quick now! Let's go!
Run to the fields!
To the fields! Quickly!
Lie down! Hide!
Hide! Lie down!
You're all nothing
but beasts! Beasts!
- Murderers! Murderers!
- Let go of those reins!
I warned you!
Oh, my God.
Oh. Oh, no.
Move that wagon out!
Hyah!
Oh, God!
For Thine is the kingdom
and the power...
and the glory forever
and ever, amen.
Our fathers
lie together, Wolf.
Two decent men trying
to help each other...
and understand
each other.
And whosoever shall lose his life
for My sake...
shall find it.
Good-bye,
dear friend.
Good-bye,
Father.
Miss Eula.
Go ahead, shoot.
We're not armed.
It seems to me there's been
enough shootin' around here, ma'am.
I'm of a different brand
than them that did it.
Rooster J. Cogburn,
United States Marshal.
- You're too late, lawman.
- Too late to stop 'em,
but not too late to hang 'em.
- What happened here?
- Last night a company of gunmen rode in,
ravaged the settlement, killed my father
and many of our Indian friends.
- I'm sorry.
- Wolf's family was killed last night.
They'll pay for it, son.
I promise you that. They'll pay for it.
For all those that take the sword
must perish with the sword.
- Huh?
- Matthew, 26:52.
Oh. Yes, ma'am.
I figure that the leader of this outfit
is a lean, mean, blue-eyed villain.
- He looked like that.
- Hmm. That was Hawk, all right.
- Do you know him?
- I'm trackin' him...
for the United States
government, Washington City.
He stole some guns
and nitro from 'em.
Plans to rob a bank
here in the territory.
- And you will stop him?
- That's my intent.
I'll find him, arrest him, take him back
to Fort Smith for trial and punishment.
- Those are my orders.
- That's one hanging I will attend.
There are nine men with him.
How can you best them?
Well, ma'am, I got
my Navy Colt sidearm...
and a Winchester rifle on my saddle
and a packet full of cartridges.
And a prayer on your lips, I hope.
You will have need of it.
And the government
has promised me a posse.
Which I figure will be long on promise
and short on posse.
Well, go with God, Marshal.
God and you and the boy.
I'm taking you to Bagby's trading post.
You'll be safe there.
Gather your belongings.
We're not going anywhere, sir.
I must stay here
and continue my father's work.
I will be both
preacher and teacher now.
I admire your sand, sister,
but you should know that
this is no place for a woman alone.
I will look after myself, and have done
so very well all of my life, thank you.
- I won't allow it.
- You have no say in the matter, sir.
I have a lot to say, sister. I am
the federal marshal for this territory,
responsible
for the citizens' safety.
Now you will pack
and come with me quietly,
or I'll arrest you
and take you anyway.
To whom do you think
you are talking, Marshal?
You is to whom I think
I'm talking, sister.
It's true, you are bigger than I am,
physically. That is all.
I think in this situation
that is enough.
You mean you are willing
to use brute force?
That is exactly what I mean.
Oh.
Yes.
Well, I will go.
But not because of your threats.
Saddle our horses, Wolf.
We'll look for grangers
to help rebuild the settlement.
You have a lot of brass, Marshal. You'll
have need of it before we are through.
She sings a loud tune.
To make sure
the good Lord hears me.
Yeah.
Well...
Go saddle
the horses, son.
Whoa.
- They there?
- Yeah.
You pushed your luck
too far last night.
Now we got Injuns after us,
along with the law.
We gotta risk it.
We're going through.
Hold it.
When I signal, follow.
When I throw this stuff,
move fast and cover your ride.
All right, Hawk!
Bring it on down!
I'd say I earned
my money today, Mr. Hawk.
You did what I'm payin' you for.
That's all.
Rooster.
Yeah, it's me
and what's left of Fort Ruby.
I'm leavin' 'em here with you, Bagby.
Take care of 'em.
- You know Miss Goodnight.
- Mr. Bagby.
- Are you all right?
- Oh, I'm fine, thank you.
- Hello, Winona.
- Boy?
Them deputies
show up yet?
- Not a sign of 'em.
- They ain't comin'.
I'll bet my drunken cat on that.
Well, I ain't waitin'.
Oh, Bagby...
that is a strong-minded woman.
You be careful or she'll end up ownin'
the store and you workin' for her.
Miss Goodnight.
Keep the faith, ma'am.
See you at the hangin'.
Wolf, come with me.
Protect yourself.
- Wolf, on my horse.
- Yes, ma'am.
Bye-bye. Thank you.
Bagby, I'm purchasing this Winchester,
the scabbard and those shells.
Thank you
for your hospitality.
- But, Miss Goodnight...
- Good-bye, sir. God bless you.
Marshal Cogburn!
- All right, what is it?
- We're riding with you.
You're ridin' nowhere
with me, sister!
- We will not slow you down
or get in your way, sir.
- 'Cause you ain't goin'!
- We'll have to ride hard
to overtake them.
- We ain't goin'!
I ride hard and alone!
I eat light and sleep on the ground!
Understood. By my reckoning, we should
reach Cheyenne Springs by sundown.
Breed, hurry up!
Hawk don't trust
a hired gun at his back.
Just at his side
in a fight.
Not then neither.
Breed's not on our side.
Breed's a whore!
Hawk paid for his services. He'd sell
us out to the law if they paid better.
-
-  Breed!
Let's get movin'.
We're fightin' time.
Marshal Cogburn,
just wait a minute, please.
I-I feel that you are angry
with me.
Ma'am, you are an almighty trial.
This is a man's work and dangerous.
For whatsoever a man soweth,
that shall he also reap.
I will make sure of what
my father's murderers reap.
You will make sure of nothing,
sister! I will! You understand?
You do your crocheting
or fingernail fixin'...
or whatever it is
that women do,
- but you stay out of my way!
- A minute, Mr. Cogburn, I'm not through.
It came to me at Bagby's that
I must help in the pursuit of these men.
I cannot shirk it.
You're a peace officer, Mr. Cogburn.
I'm sure that
you understand about duty.
I slept and dreamed
that life was beauty.
I woke and found
that life was duty.
I don't suppose that
you're familiar...
with the poems
of Ella Sturgis Hooper?
No, ma'am, and I ain't interested
in hearing 'em recited.
And you can forget
about your duty!
General Lee thought it was the most
beautiful word in the English language.
What the devil do you know
about General Lee?
That he was
a Christian gentleman,
and that he was soundly whipped
in the field by Yankees!
If they ever give 'em the vote,
God help us.
Hawk, I need some help.
I need some help
on this wagon, Hawk.
Okay, go ahead.
Come on! Come on!
All right,
take it easy now.
Easy!
Keep her up there.
- Slow her down.
- Keep it up.
- He's takin' a chance with this nitro.
- He's gamblin' for big stakes.
With our backs. I'd rather go down
shootin' than with a broke back!
- Come on, boys. Take it easy.
-  Whoa!
- The nitro! Hold it up!
- Support that nitro!
- Get a probe. Get in under here.
- Leroy, get back there!
Get to pryin' here.
Hold it now.
- Let's get under it, boys.
- All right. Easy! Easy!
It ain't nothin'.
The wheel just popped.
Wedge it up and put it back on.
We'll be out of here in ten minutes.
The axle's broke, Hawk.
All right, fix it!
Don't waste the time we saved.
The axle's broke, Hawk!
It’ll take till morning to fix it.
Nothin' is gonna keep me away
from that gold.
Nothin', you hear?
Nothin'!
All right, I'll ride
with Breed to Goldstrike.
He'll size up the bank.
I'll see Dakota, set the plan.
If this nitro ain't in town
by Friday, the game's over.
Hawk! I'm gonna
ride along with you.
I gotta get myself to a doc,
before I quits on myself.
Ride along but don't hold me back. Ain't
got time for wet-nursin' no cripple.
- We won't let you down, boss.
- Don't. I ain't a good loser.
Wolf, I got a hunch...
we're just a little way
from a lot of trouble.
Now I want you to get up there
and take a careful look all around.
Meanwhile, I'll try and keep
her ladyship occupied.
- Yes, sir.
- Marshal Cogburn...
we are here together,
and it is our obligation...
to be on good terms
with each other.
As long as we limit our remarks
about the war between the states,
I don't think there'll be
any open hostility.
Sister,
why don't you step down.
We'll give these horses' backs a rest,
get a little stretch.
Why are you called Rooster?
I never heard a man called that before.
Well, I guess in the old days,
I was cocky, kind of a struttin' bird.
Have not changed much,
as I see it.
My tail feathers may droop
a little and my wattles show,
but I can still outcrow
anything in the barnyard.
Ooh, there's no doubt
about that.
But can you
outdo them too?
Well, sister, if I couldn't, I wouldn't
have much to crow about, would I?
Well, it all depends on the barnyard,
doesn't it?
Rooster is
your Christian name?
My baptized name is Reuben, but
I ask you not to repeat that to nobody.
Why not? It's a name
of which to be proud.
At one time, Reuben led the foremost
tribe of Israel.
Well, it hit
rock bottom with me.
I'm bound to ask you this. Is your name
written in the Lamb's Book of Life?
Oh, sister,
are you licensed to preach?
What kind of a church do you belong to
anyway? They let women preach in it?
I'm not an exhorter,
Mr. Cogburn.
Service to others
is my witness.
I'm a teacher and something
of a journeyman nurse.
Ayah.
I can pull teeth.
I'm sorry that
you don't like me.
Oh, it ain't that I don't like you.
It's how you talk.
How would you
have me talk?
It's my business to speak
of these things.
It isn't that.
It's the way you talk.
"Ayah, ayah."
What is that business?
Oh, it's my Yankee speech itself that
you find offensive?
- I do.
- I must try to remedy that.
Paul tells us that we must be all things
to all men.
I'll have to learn some
vulgar southern expressions.
I'll have to learn
to be lazy and slovenly.
I'll tell you something
else that Paul said:
Let your women
be silent in church.
How come you know
that passage?
Well, Judge Parker's
partial to it.
You know, you're not
the only one with a Bible.
He's got a big one.
Make two or three of yours.
It's not the size
that's important, Marshal,
but your knowledge
of its contents.
Repent ye, therefore,
and be converted.
You have something to say from that Good
Book about every occasion, don't you?
Ayah.
It was my primer.
In Boston, church children learn
their letters from it.
I figured you for a Yankee, but you look
more like a prairie bird:
Bony and tough.
As the only girl
in a family of boys,
I suspect I grew up
more forceful...
and independent
than a woman should be.
Amen, sister. Amen!
Marshal,
you're prayin'.
That's the first step
on the road to salvation.
Well, this ain't no church social
nor a revival meeting.
So don't try to convert me, sister,
or you'll end up with a... empty sack!
Marshal Cogburn,
a wagon and riders!
Ayah, that's the wagon.
- I recognize the wagon.
- Just the way I figured. But, sister...
you pay heed to every word
I say till this thing is over.
Naturally, Marshal.
Let's go.
Wolf, I want you
to take these horses and hide 'em.
- Then get up beyond that bend
and signal when they're comin'.
- Yes, sir.
When I yell, "Posse!"
I want you two to shoot up
in the air, make a lot of noise.
Don't shoot at 'em. You might hit
that nitro, and then we'd all be gone.
You got that straight? Here, let me
show you there. This thing's loaded.
All you have to do is pull that back,
point it up in the air, squeeze it.
- You understand?
- Yes, yes, I think I understand.
- Get up there behind that broken log.
- Right.
- Don't forget that thing's loaded.
- No, I'll remember.
Sister, they're comin'.
Sister!
Whoa! What's going on here?
Get these logs outta the road!
I wouldn't do that!
Rooster J. Cogburn,
United States Marshal.
Head of the posse's
got you surrounded.
I'd keep my hand away
from them rifles.
Anybody can say he's a marshal.
Let's see you. Where's all your men?
Listen, you riffraff,
you know who I am and what I'll do!
I'm arrestin' you all and takin' you
and the wagon into Fort Smith.
Now, clamp your hands on your heads
and get off them horses.
He ain't got
nobody with him.
- He's bluffin'.
- He'd better be.
You're all talk!
We ain't seen nothin' yet!
We ain't afraid of you,
Rooster!
Next one goes into that nitro.
Okay, dismount, boys.
That's more like it.
Damn your murderin' hides!
Meet your maker! Posse!
- He's got a posse.
- Let's get outta here.
Y'all right, sister?
- Wolf, give me a hand with these logs.
- Yes, sir.
Marshal, thank God
you're safe.
Hey, Wolf, that was
a great shot you made.
- But I didn't shoot, sir.
-
You mean to say that you shot across
that nitro wagon at that man?
If you'd have hit that nitro,
you'd have killed us all.
But I didn't. And if I hadn't shot him,
you'd be dead instead of him.
What were you trying to do,
talk him to death?
If that could happen, ma'am,
you wouldn't have needed that rifle.
Marshal, I'd like
to say a few words over the dead.
Good or bad,
they're God's own.
They look like they're past carin',
but go ahead.
The Lord have mercy on us
for what we did.
I am the resurrection and the life,
sayeth the Lord.
He that believeth in Me,
though he were dead, yet shall he live.
And whosoever liveth and believeth in Me
shall never die.
The Lord gave, and the Lord has taken
away. Blessed be the name of the Lord.
We brought nothing into this world
and we can take nothing out of it.
Unto Almighty God I commend
the souls of these men.
Hurry it up, sister,
or we'll be joinin' 'em.
For Thine is the kingdom and the power
and the glory forever and ever, amen.
Earth to earth,
ashes to ashes...
- And dust to dust.
- And dust to dust.
Get up in the wagon.
My father's murderer
was not among them.
There's a federal bank
in Goldstrike.
I figure Hawk's there
setting up the stealing,
and this bunch will be
hightailing it to him.
But I'll get my chance.
I'm gonna bait me a rattrap,
and this is the cheese.
Be careful that you do not
end up being the cheese.
Sister, your confidence
in me is inspiring.
I'm gonna take this wagon
to Sulphur Bottom,
wait for 'em
to catch up to me there.
Spring my trap
on my own ground.
That's not
what's worrying me.
- You gotta help me protect her, son.
- Yes, sir.
- We'll protect her.
- Good boy.
~ Sittin' by the roadside
Eatin' goober peas ~
~ Goobers, how delicious
Eatin' goober peas ~~
How did a blue-blooded
Boston lady like you...
ever learn
to shoot like that?
My first beau taught me. He taught me
how to shoot and equitation.
- "Equitation"?
- Ayah. You know, horseback riding.
Oh! Well, I've been
doing that for ten lustrums.
"Lustrums"?
- Fifty years.
- Oh.
Ayah. I see.
Well, to continue, my first beau was
a dashing young man.
A bit simpleminded. I think I must have
scared him off with my manner.
He taught me how to shoot well,
don't you agree?
Fair.
How old are you?
Shall we say it has
already struck midnight?
- How much do you weigh?
- My word!
I don't mind scrawny women. My first
wife had bones stickin' out all over.
- I didn't know you were married.
- She left me.
Must have been like Jack Spratt
and his wife, only in reverse.
They had a good arrangement,
the Spratts, I must say.
- Do you get paid for everybody
you bring into your church?
- It doesn't work like that.
I don't get anything.
I do well to get my keep.
- No fees?
- No fees.
- You haven't got any money of your own?
- Very little.
I thought that.
I take it you're on the scout
for a rich widow.
It's my guess that you can't cook
either. 'Course that's just my guess.
It appears then that
I don't measure up.
That's a mercy.
You got more backbone than femaleness.
That's a fact.
Yeah, Marshal, I would say
that that is a fact.
Well, out
in the territory,
we prize a dead shot more than we do
a lady's charms.
Then I've come to the right place,
haven't I?
You mean the men
in the West do not mind...
if their women outshoot
and outsmart them?
If they're quiet about it.
Out here, we value
a spirited woman...
almost as much as we do
a spirited horse.
- Almost as much, eh?
- Yes, ma'am, almost as much.
Not quite, but almost.
Hyah.
Hawk.
Hawk, I don't think
I can make it.
Leave him. We ain't got time
for diggin'. Let the buzzards have him.
Marshal Cogburn, I'm curious.
What is it that you're doing?
Well, I am busy trying to follow the
regulations laid down by Uncle Sam.
That gentleman will have
his fee sheets just and correct,
or he won't pay.
You're keeping a record
of expenditures, is that it?
Well, somethin' like that.
Without a deputy to help me,
it's the devil's own work.
Without any schoolin', you're up
against it in this country, sister.
Perhaps I can help you.
Oh, well,
I'd be obliged.
Oh. Now, now...
now these forms are ruled
with places for the entries,
but your handwriting seems to wander
into places where it should not go.
Here, I'll rub out your chicken tracks
and work them over.
Now what's this entry?
"Important words with Blue, $2.00."
Oh, that's the soldier boy
that gave me a tip on Hawk and his gang.
And charged his government
money for the information?
Well, not exactly. I can't remember
the details of every transaction.
" Travel rations
for Miss Eula Goodnight...
and Indian boy, Wolf,
$3.00."
Well, we brought
our own food.
- They don't know that.
- They may be smarter than you think.
From now on, you must have approximate
dates that lend substance to your...
Alcohol on an empty stomach has killed
more men than outlaws' bullets.
You don't say?
Well, ma'am, my stomach ain't empty.
It's full of corn dodgers.
Balls of hot water corn bread
made by Chen Lee, my friend.
- Must be near to 50 in there.
- Why are they called corn dodgers?
Dodgin' corn whiskey
in my innards, I guess.
You'd be better off
dodging it too.
A drinking man
is half a man.
You cannot give weight
to the words of a drunkard.
- They are meaningless.
- Oh, come on, sister.
Don't tell me that you stand in judgment
of a man who pulls a cork now and then.
I do. It's a weakness that indicates
a decided lack of character.
That shows you know more about the Lord
and His Good Book than you do about men.
That's my good fortune.
I know enough about men
to have steered clear of them.
I had no hankerin'
to have one of my own...
and no desire
to produce more of the same.
Wolf.
- Yes, sir?
- She's frightening.
Look, uh, I got me
a.22 pepperbox here.
Now, this thing shoots five times,
sometimes all at once.
It is called
a lady's companion,
and that is what I intend it be used for
when I leave you two off.
Now, back in Fort Smith,
there is a sportin' lady named Big Faye.
She was shot twice
with this thing.
But she dresses out
at about 290, so...
none of the bullets found their way
to any of the vitals.
But, against ordinary people,
this gives good service.
Now I want you
to protect sister with it.
Thank you, sir. I shall guard Miss Eula
with my life.
Well, more than likely,
it'll be the other way.
But you take good care of her.
She is somethin'.
- You wait here for Dakota.
- I could use a drink myself.
I only drink
with friends.
Good shot, Marshal! You are hitting
more than you are missing now!
Well, them that I ain't hittin', lad,
I ain't aimin' at.
If you're not careful, Hawk's men will
hear the noise and be looking for you.
And if they ain't careful,
they'll find me. Hurray!
Hey, Wolf, chalk up
two of them things!
Hallelujah!
Your equitation teacher
do that?
Marshal Cogburn,
we're ready to go.
Shooting corn bread in a meadow
is not taking us anywhere,
and my father's murderers
ride free.
- Well, sister, I was just celebrating.
- Celebrating what?
Being alive, sister,
being alive.
You're shooting your own food.
Whiskey is making you silly.
Why do people wish to be silly?
Why do people wish to be sober?
Life ain't an easy game, sister.
Don't hurt to make a fool
of yourself once in awhile.
Yes, once in awhile,
but not more often than not.
Marshal Cogburn,
you're in a sorry state.
You're unsteady on your feet,
untidy in your person...
rank with the smell of sweat
and spirits.
Cleanliness and abstinence are next
to godliness, or had you forgotten?
No, I ain't forgotten. I ain't forgot
the naggin' schemin' ways of a woman.
You're figurin' to take a bottle out
of my hand, put a cake of soap in it;
probably a Bible
for a gun in the other.
Well, it ain't gonna work.
No bit and harness for me.
I am what I am.
That's what I am. I...
Wolf.
-  Give me a hand.
- Yes, sir.
-
-
I'm fine.
~ I painted her
I painted her ~
~~
~ I promised her
I promised her ~
~ A ring and a weddin'
after the beddin' ~
~ Golden trinkets too ~
~ And I left her then
And I'm free again ~
~ 'Cause I never
promised her when ~~
I'll tell him.
You made good time.
Where'd you leave the wagon?
That's why we come here so soon, Hawk.
We lost the wagon.
A posse of marshals ambushed us.
They got Nose and Emmett.
Whiskey.
You'd turn tail
if a jackrabbit jumped you.
Rooster Cogburn
ain't no jackrabbit.
Cogburn?
- Cogburn aced you?
- Yeah.
Let's go.
- You'll never take him, Hawk.
- Yeah?
Yeah.
I rode scout for him
for three years, and I know.
You take my money, you wear my brand.
Got it?
Get your butts in the saddle.
We're ridin'.
We'll make an early camp
today. This looks like a likely spot.
Is it safe
to stop overnight, sir?
We gotta rest these horses.
Unhitch 'em.
Anyway, I'm not worried
about them roadrunners.
They'll be in Goldstrike
lickin' their wounds...
and consortin'
with lewd women.
They won't start
after us until morning.
Man, am I thirsty.
I'm gonna
fetch some water.
Drinkin' water, that is.
Washin' water I am a stranger to
and will leave to you to draw.
Marshal Cogburn,
I'm sorry if I offended you...
with my remarks regarding
your personal habits.
I didn't realize that you were
of such a sensitive nature.
Ma'am, my hide is tougher
than boot leather,
but no man alive likes to be called
high-smellin' and low-down.
That's true. But when something
unpleasant must be said,
it's best
to have done with it.
A sharp knife cuts the quickest
and hurts the least.
And oft should be left
in the scabbard.
You're a flash
of lightning, Marshal.
No, I just follow
the thunder.
Well, I'll just follow
my own advice...
and retire to the stream
to perform my ablutions.
Her...
Her what?
Her, uh...
Hey, sister!
You better be careful
movin' around out there.
Everything that grows
in this country will either...
bite you, stab you
or stick you.
Will she be all right?
Any varmint that crosses that
lady's path has met its match.
You too, Marshal?
She'll never get the best of me.
You can bet on that.
Why do women
always want to change a man?
- Is it the same with Indian women?
- Yes.
Miss Goodnight would be
regarded as highly as a warrior
who performs bravely in battle.
Hmm. Well, no man wants
to put his boots under a warrior's bed.
Hey, I heard flappin' noises
back in them trees.
As soon as we get this camp set up,
let's go huntin'.
Get us a turkey.
Surprise Miss Eula with a good meal.
- I would like that very much, sir.
- Good. Good.
This here's where
they waylaid us, Hawk.
There was marshals
all around.
They can't be far.
That wagon's too heavy
to move fast...
and too risky
to move by night.
Breed, how many?
Tracks are hard to read.
Sure as hell ain't no posse.
What?
Do you hear that, you stupid bastards?
He galled you!
Now you listen to me,
all of you.
I ain't goin' away
without that nitro!
I'll kill Rooster for it!
And I'll kill each one of you,
you show yellow again.
Here. Drink yourself
some guts.
Hello, the camp!
We must have hiked ten miles trying
to get a shot at a turkey.
Bagby's gun pulls left
as it fires...
and the sight is off a little,
but it's a beauty.
- Son, we been outclassed.
- We got a mixed bag, Miss Eula.
- An owl and a possum.
- Put them in the pot.
We'll have wilderness stew.
You shot 'em,
skin 'em.
Marshal, did you ever come up
against Jesse James or Billy the Kid?
Naw, I never
ran into them folks.
Did I ever tell you about the time Lucky
Ned Pepper and gang were chasin' me?
- No, I'd like to hear about that.
- Ayah, tell us.
Well, that was something.
They chased me until I got tired of it,
then I just whirled
my old horse, Bo, around,
took them reins in my teeth
and rid right at them villains.
I was shootin' my saddle pistol
with one hand...
and whirlin' my Winchester
with the other.
Never took aim.
Just snap shot and got 'em all.
Marshal, are you sure
you're not...
stretchin' the blanket
a little bit?
I was thinkin' you'd figure that way,
so I told it gospel.
Proof is,
I'm here and they're dead.
-
- One sad thing that day.
Lost old Bo.
Marshal,
would you like more to eat?
No, I don't think so. I'm full.
I'll tell you what I could stand.
I'd pay three dollars
for a pickled buffalo tongue right now.
I'd have thought you'd
had enough pickled tongue for one day.
No, but I've had enough tongue
that's more barbed than pickled,
and mighty indigestible.
I know. It often is.
Well, sister, how do you stand
on the sin of tobacco?
Well, I know of no passage
or verse to prove it,
but I'm quite certain
that the good Lord smokes a fine cigar.
- Hallelujah.
- Marshal, is your eye bothering you?
I could soothe it
with a poultice.
Oh, no thanks, ma'am.
It's past helpin'.
Was it a hunting accident
that cost you your eye?
You might say that.
Huntin' Yankees.
I lost it in the war ridin' with
Bill Anderson and Captain Quantrill.
Times have sure changed.
- Here I am workin' for a damned Yankee.
-
But you haven't changed, sir.
You're still hunting.
Well... I guess
I like marshalin'...
better than anything
I've done since the war.
I like buffalo huntin', but them
big shaggies is just about gone now.
Damn shame. I was skinnin' buffalo down
at Yellow Horse Creek, Texas.
The pay was great, but I just
couldn't stand that open country.
I'll bet there weren't
six trees between there and Canada.
Oh, I love the freedom of
the open prairie. You love freedom too.
Yeah, yeah.
I only lost it once.
But my wife and I are
travelin' different roads now.
She didn't like my friends, and
she didn't like me when I was myself.
So my drinkin' picked up.
She got a bellyful of it and left me.
Now I'm livin' happily ever after
with my cat, General Sterling Price,
and my friend, Chen Lee,
the Chinaman.
They let a man be.
Be what, Marshal?
Well, be... be hisself.
He don't have to change.
But change is
progress, Marshal.
You don't look too old to change.
Life is a school.
Well, teacher, don't you start pressin'
your dress for my graduation...
'cause I intend to stay
in my own low class,
indefinitely!
May I have more
possum stew, ma'am?
Opossum, Wolf. Opossum.
An American marsupial.
Oh. Wolf, maybe you better
give me some of that owl meat.
A little of that in a Rooster's
gizzard might make me smart.
A wise old owl sat on an oak.
The more he heard,
the less he spoke.
The less he spoke,
the more he heard.
Now wasn't that
a wise old bird?
I guess there's some kind of a lesson
in that for me, for both of us.
- How many miles you think we rode today?
- Oh, about 20.
It feels like
more than that.
Wait a minute, sister.
Maybe I can help.
That feels good.
I'll bet your backside
hurts worse than anything.
Yes, well...
We can't do anything
about that, can we?
I reckon not, sister.
Better.
The layin' on
of the hands.
How do you happen
to know about that?
What I know might
surprise you, sister.
My friend, nothing about you
would surprise me.
Oh, just a minute,
sister.
I'll put my lariat
around your bed.
Them night crawlers
and snakes will respect it.
Is that really true that
they won't crawl over a rope?
I ain't gonna say it's true.
I ain't gonna say it ain't.
But it's comfortin'.
Thank you, Reuben.
The Good Book says: Let not the sun
go down on thy wrath.
I'm glad that it did not.
Good night, sister.
- Good night, Reuben.
- Wolf, give me a hand.
Yes, sir.
Good night, ma'am.
Good night, Wolf.
This Gatling gun's
a little heavy.
Set this up
for our protection.
In case I was wrong
about them cutthroats,
we'll still have
the advantage.
A little chilly. Well, I guess we better
stand guard tonight...
over there
across the creek.
Now you take
the first watch,
and I'll spell you
around midnight.
- Thank you. You got that pepperbox?
- Right here.
Good. Now don't use it
unless you have to.
First sign of trouble,
you give that coyote howl...
and hightail it
back here to camp.
Now that big, flat rock
on that side,
- that's a good place for lookout.
- Sir?
- Yeah?
- Has there ever been an Indian marshal?
- Not that I heard tell of.
- That's what I'd like to be.
A man like you.
You ain't aimin'
your sights very high, son,
but if you'd like
to follow my tracks, l...
I'll help you
up the trail and proud to.
- Thank you, sir.
- Good night, son.
Good night, sir.
Reuben...
have you ever seen an enlarged
picture of a drunkard's liver?
Damnation.
Even in their sleep?
Ow!
Good night, Miss Goodnight.
Good night, Reuben.
Bring him.
Leroy, take him down there.
Go on. Spread out.
-
- What?
Stay down.
Stay down.
Where are you?
Where are you, Wolf?
I got him, Rooster!
- That you, Hawk?
- You know it is!
Uh-huh. Guess you're interested
in this wagon.
You let
that boy go!
Stay down.
I will let him go, when you
give me back that wagon.
Breed, you there?
I'm here, Rooster.
- You all right?
- I'm all right.
You're the one
with a little trouble.
I want that wagon! You ain't goin'
nowhere with it!
Give it to me
or I'll kill your Indian boy!
You kill that Indian boy,
and I'll blow up this wagon.
And hunt every one of you down
and cut you throat to throat. Oh!
All right, I'll trade that
damn wagon for the boy...
if he ain't harmed!
Leroy,
show him the bait.
When they lower their guns,
break cover and rush 'em. Shoot to kill.
All right, bring him across.
We'll stand aside.
Marshal, it's a trick! They're gonna
kill you!
-
- Hold your fire!
Nice work, boy. Here, sister,
give Wolf your rifle.
You may have the boy now, but we ain't
movin' until we get what's ours!
And neither are you!
Well, now, I got pretty good position
here and some mean deputies.
You're a liar, Rooster.
You ain't got no posse.
I got your Gatling gun,
and I got it set up.
I'll give you two minutes
to cut and run...
or I'm gonna fill you
full of holes like a sieve.
You got the gun, but you ain't
got the know-how to use it!
Deputy, show 'em.
Ain't that the way it works?
Now hightail it out of here...
before I forget my promise
to Judge Parker: Bring you in alive.
That was good, Rooster!
But the odds will change
when the sun comes up!
Spread out.
When he tries to move that wagon
in the morning, we'll make our play.
- Wolf, did you see their horses?
- Yes, sir, up there.
Uh-huh. Do you think you could
work your way up there and spook 'em?
- I can do it, sir.
- Good man.
You're risking
the boy's life.
I am counting a little on
your relationship with the Lord, ma'am.
- Can you hitch a team?
- Yes, I can hitch a team.
I'm gonna maneuver myself over there
and get their attention.
- You hitch up that team
and saddle those horses.
- Yes, yes.
Hawk, you there?
Ready to deal, Rooster!
I'm gonna give you one last chance
to give yourself up.
Wait till daylight!
We'll see who's ready
to give up!
I'll get you a fair trial
and a fine hanging.
Might even get you life
at the federal house in Detroit.
They'll teach you how to read
and write there. Of course,
the rest of it ain't so good.
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!
Get them horses!
Grab 'em!
Good work, Wolf.
You bought us some time. Hyah!
Hyah!
Wolf, give me a hand.
You folks runnin'
from something or to something?
Both.
Are you goin'
across?
We aim to use your raft.
Ten cents for a horse and rider.
Dollar for a wagon.
Fifty cents extra
for heavy cargo.
A show of money is required
before passage.
Well, I'm Rooster J. Cogburn,
Federal Marshal.
The men I'm stalkin' are hot on my tail,
and I'm gonna need help.
I want you to give sanctuary
to this woman and boy.
If I'd wanted women and children here,
I'd have had my own.
They ain't nothing
but trouble.
So don't saddle me
with your discards.
You ain't
very hospitable.
I ain't got an ounce of good will in me,
and that's a fact.
I hate everybody. I'm
a cantankerous old man, and I know it.
I like myself better
than anyone I've ever met.
That's how come I took this job:
To be alone with me.
- Watch that nitro.
- What?
Let me know
if you decide to go across.
I can't stay out in this heat
any longer.
The sun is frying
my brains.
The only way I can
get this stuff down...
to Sulphur Bottom
is downriver.
What am I gonna do
with you two?
It's too risky
to leave you here.
Maybe I can land you someplace
before the shootin' starts.
Old man!
- Are you goin' across?
- No.
We're gonna go downriver.
We're loanin' the raft off you.
That ain't loanin'!
That's stealin'!
Am I gonna have
trouble with you?
Not a teeny-weeny bit,
as long as you got that.
I'm securin' this for the law,
and the law will pay off.
I ain't got much use
for the law.
'Course, it ain't got
much use for me neither.
Is there any law says you can't
help us unload this thing?
- Not if it'll get you
out of here any faster.
- Well, there you are.
Do you know anything
about ridin' a raft?
There's rough water
downriver.
I know how to ride a horse.
Couldn't be much different.
You ain't no sailor.
I can see that.
Water is like a woman:
Sly and fickle.
You gotta keep your eye
on it every minute.
- You a sailor?
- I was once. McCoy's my name.
Been around the Horn.
Sailed the seven seas.
Seen everything.
Done everything.
That's how I know that people are
so miserable. I've seen 'em all.
You're wrong, old man!
We're made in God's image, His goodness
is a part of all of us! Even you!
Amazing! I never took you
for a Bible thumper!
Hold it, mister. She is what she is
'cause that's what she wants to be.
That's the way you'll take her,
and that's the way I take her.
You're wasting your time
preachin' at me. You too, sister.
I'm a ship that
can't be salvaged.
With God,
all things are possible.
You're sure shippin' out
with a strange crew.
I'll match their mettle
against most.
Well, I'm glad it's your command,
not mine.
Women can no more keep their mouths shut
than a yellowtail catfish.
Gotta agree
with you there.
We'll ride ahead and take 'em
at the narrows.
Breed, you and Luke river trail 'em.
Keep 'em in sight.
Join us at the narrows,
just ahead of 'em.
Hold your course!
Keep that rudder amidships when you hit
that white water downriver.
Ain't nobody ever shot
them rapids on a raft before.
You just take care of my horses,
Commodore. I'll be back for 'em.
Don't you crack up my vessel
on them rocks! You hear me?
It's so lovely here.
I wish we could sail
right on down to the sea.
Right now, Webber Falls
would be more to my liking.
We'll get there tomorrow,
with the good Lord's help.
Sir, would you really have killed
those men with the Gatling gun?
They believed I would.
In a pinch, a convincing lie is as good
as a posse, sometimes better.
Marshal, tell me more about some
of the outlaws and how you bested them.
- Oh, well...
- If you gentlemen will excuse me,
I'll go and have a little sleep.
I've had enough of your
derring-do for one day.
Yeah.
- You ever heard of Abilene?
- No.
Well, I was there once lookin'
for a bunco steerer named 21-Jewel Slim.
That Abilene is the worst place
I have ever saw.
It is a sink of crime.
Why, I was standin'
on Horse Thief Corner,
when Prairie Rose come down
the middle of the street...
with nothin' on
but her two six-guns.
- She was stark naked
and painted up one side...
-  Wolf...
stop polin'
and get some rest.
- You've got to spell
Marshal Cogburn tonight.
- Yes, ma'am.
What color was she painted,
Reuben?
Breed, ain't no love lost
between you and Hawk or him and me.
If you was willing to quit him now
and join up with me,
I think we could take
the raft ourselves...
and be rich men
instead of dead ones.
You game?
Maybe.
What's your plan?
Come on, I'll show you.
We'll lay the rope underneath the water
so they can't see it.
When they get up to it,
it'll pull tight and stop 'em.
Old Rooster, he's gonna
wanna cut that rope...
or stretch it up
and float the raft underneath.
That's when I get me
a good shot at him...
without a chance
of blowing the nitro.
You kill
the other two.
We'll land
the cargo later.
What makes you think
this is gonna work?
It’ll work, partner.
Now what?
Take this tiller, Wolf.
What's holdin' us up?
Something's foul here.
Rooster, cut it loose.
Breed?
Yeah.
You saved my life once.
- Now we're even.
- Grateful to you.
Hawk's waitin'
for you downriver.
I can't help you there.
Well...
we'll be ready for him.
-
- Someone's comin'.
-
-  It's me, Hawk.
What the hell you doin' here?
Where's Luke?
He's dead.
We shot it out with Rooster.
Luke lost.
I told you to track him,
not take him!
What happened?
Tried to stop the raft with a rope
across the river.
Rooster cut it
and got away.
We gun fought him,
but, uh...
Hell, Hawk,
he's just too good for us.
Let me see your gun.
You don't want my gun.
Oh, yes, I do.
You know, Breed here,
he gun fought old Rooster
with just one bullet.
You're a liar, Breed.
I owed him one.
I wish this thing had
a little more giddyap to it.
I picked these blackberries yesterday,
Reuben. Would you like some?
Oh, no. Not for me.
I have to be careful.
- I can't eat just anything. I get colic.
- Hmm?
Of course, my mouth
is slickerin' for one thing.
Chen Lee's corn bread, fried
in a big ladle of coon meat grease.
Yes. Well, when we get back
to Fort Smith,
I'd like to meet Mr. Lee
and get his recipe.
Will we get back, Reuben?
What are our chances?
The odds are the same, sister.
They ain't in our favor.
When you drop us off
at Webber's Falls...
and go out after them,
you will be careful,
won't you, Reuben?
Wolf and I care about you,
very much.
Well, ma'am...
I don't know much...
about thoroughbreds,
horses or women.
Them that I did know,
I never liked.
They're too nervous and spooky.
They scare me.
But you're one highbred filly
that don't.
I don't know what you're
talkin' about half the time,
but that don't matter.
Bein' around you pleases me.
Those are about the nicest words I ever
heard said to me. Thank you, Reuben.
Well, uh...
Wolf, I'll spell you.
We got you now, Rooster,
you old fraud!
Throw your guns in the water, pull that
scow ashore and keep your hands high!
And don't try nothin'!
You'll be dead by breakfast!
That's a rattlesnake's warnin'!
You squat assassin!
Your schemin' ain't gonna
help you now, Rooster!
Don't you rely on it, Hawk!
Don't you rely on it!
That'll keep their heads down.
- There's one!
-
Don't hit the nitro.
Shoot wide of 'em.
Force 'em into the bank.
-
-
Them rapids
will get him now.
No... I will.
The Lord is with us.
So is that current.
If He owes you any favors, lady,
now's the time to collect.
Get out of the way, Wolf.
All right,
brace yourself.
- God help us!
- If He does, I'll give up drinkin'!
The gun! The gun, Reuben!
We've lost the gun!
Well, now, sister, just what
the hell can I do about it?
The rope!
Watch it there, sister!
Hold tight!
Oh, no!
You all right, sister?
I don't know.
Am I all right?
I don't know.
How did we do it?
Your friend
must have been on the job.
I guess He must have...
been on the job.
My God!
Marshal, look!
It's a showdown.
Well... we did
the best we could.
Sister, I ain't never had a fight
I didn't finish standin' up.
We'll finish this one,
maybe not standin' up.
But we'll finish it
the way we planned it.
Come on, Wolf.
Get those lines loose.
Have a care with that nitro.
Easy does it.
Now... ease them boxes
into the water.
Remember,
it's nitro glycerin.
Well...
we'll see.
They never made it, Hawk.
Yeah, but the nitro did.
Now.
Hold your fire!
Marshal Cogburn
is injured and dying.
Take your dynamite,
but give us safe passage
down the river.
Sure, lady,
we'll do that.
We'll just
take that load,
and then we'll send you
and your hero on your way.
Straight to hell.
Come on.
Now, Reuben.
Payday!
Come and get it, boys!
Payday!
Well...
we won the battle,
but I lost my job.
Maybe not.
See, Judge, the Lord could very easily
have struck down the Midianites...
and the Amalekites with a wave of
His mighty hand, but He didn't do that.
He raised up a Gideon
with which to smite them.
An ordinary man,
like the marshal there.
- It's in the book of Judges, Judge.
- I know where it is, madam.
Very ingenious defense.
It takes one's breath away.
But I do not believe the Lord has
raised up a Gideon here at Fort Smith.
No. If He's raised up anything,
I fear it's a Rooster.
A willful, strutting old bird who hasn't
paid any attention to the criminal code.
But he has!
I killed that criminal trash!
- Not Marshal Cogburn!
- What?
-  Sit down!
He wanted him hung here,
at your convenience,
- Oh, back up, sister!
- But I couldn't do that!
- Silence in this court!
- My father's honor was at stake!
- Shut up!
- He was shot...
Will you take Reuben's
word for it or mine?
- Reuben?
-
Well, in view of past
experience with Reuben,
I'm afraid
I'll have to take yours.
Get back on the rail,
sister.
This man may pull
a cork now and then,
but he's as straight
as a string.
- Now you're back on the rail.
- He's the best marshal you have,
and he's worth more money...
- than you pay him!
- Reuben, you are reinstated,
and this court is recessed...
and dismissed!
Reinstated.
Yeah. Yeah!
-  Congratulations, Marshal.
- Oh, well...
...Reuben.
Damn Chinaman.
There is one thing
I would like to get straight.
We both know that the Lord
brands lyin' a sin.
You think He'll still smile on you
after them whoppers you told in there?
And if thy words stray from the truth
for the good of God's own,
if thy intent be pure,
thou shalt not then be judged sinful.
Beautiful quotation.
What book? What chapter?
I will confess, Reuben, it is
of my own invention. I just made it up.
Hallelujah and jubilee!
That is one quotation I will remember.
And will you remember us too,
Reuben?
Longer than I'll remember
that quotation, Miss Eula.
We found five families...
who will homestead at Fort Ruby
and help us resettle it.
Will you see us off tomorrow at the
Texas Road? We join the wagon train.
I will consider it
a privilege, ma'am.
Well, ma'am...
this is where our trails part.
Maybe they'll
cross again, Reuben.
Well, that's something I think
I'd like to drink to, ma'am.
After that vow
you took on the river?
When a soul needs revivin',
thou shalt reach for help.
- Book and chapter?
- Rooster Cogburn, 1880.
Will you join me, ma'am?
Well, maybe I will try
just a little sip.
To someday.
Someday.
- Good-bye, Marshal.
- Good-bye, son.
Good-bye, Reuben.
Watch your drinkin',
ma'am.
And if you ever have need of
a one-eyed, old peace officer...
Reuben, I have to say it.
Livin' with you
has been an adventure...
any woman would relish
for the rest of time.
I look at you, with your burnt-out face
and your big belly...
and your bear-like paws
and your shining eye,
and I have to say you're a credit
to the whole male sex,
and I'm proud
to have you for my friend.
I'll be damned if she didn't get
the last word in again.
Well...
