Oh, no!
Come on!
Come on, baby.
Grab it!
-
-
All right.
What...?
Ow!
Hmm. Vincent.
No, no, bad idea.
Bad idea!
Hmm?
-
- Aah!
Just take what you need.
Just take what you need.
Mm-hmm.
-
-
What's...?
Mmm.
-
- Whuh?
- RJ?
- Uh, no?
The moon's not full.
You woke me up a week early?
Oh, no.
Don't tell me you're
dumb enough to actually
try and steal my stuff.
RJ, I'm gonna have to kill you.
Please, I'm just
a desperate guy trying
to feed his family.
- You don't have a family.
- I meant a family of one.
OK, wait, wait, wait,
wait! Look, it's still
in the cave.
So, technically, not stolen.
-
- Oh, no!
No!
Slow!
Stop!
- Whew!
-
- That was close.
-
Vincent, wait!
I can get it all back!
That's right!
If you eat me,
you'd have to do it.
But I can get it.
All of it!
- My red wagon?
- Redder! Ow.
- The blue cooler?
- Blue cooler. On my list!
- Gotta be blue?
- Yes!
And I want my Spuddies.
I love those things.
'Cause with a Spuddie,
enough just isn't enough.
So true. Painfully true.
And I'll tell you what.
I'm gonna get you
the giant picnic pack,
family-fun size.
- They have that?
- I'm pretty sure.
All right, RJ.
I'm going back to sleep.
When that moon is full,
I'm waking up.
And all my stuff
had better be
right back where it was.
But that's just one week!
That's impossible
for one guy!
A week's perfect.
I'll get some helpers.
Full moon, all my stuff.
And don't even think
about running away.
Because if you do,
I will hunt you down
and kill you.
OK! OK, buddy! You just
rest easy, all right,
'cause I'm on it.
Hey, in a week from now,
we're gonna be laughing
about this thing. Huh?
-
Oh, boy,
that's cold! That's cold!
The one place
I didn't have a shell.
Wow.
Spring.
That means there's only
Everybody, wake up!
Hibernation's over.
Oh, morning!
- Morning, Hammy.
- I gotta go wee-wee!
Oh, not in the lake
we drink from!
Let's go, all right,
the rest of you.
It's spring!
That means
we gotta get to work.
Finished. No, wait!
Come on, everybody. Wake up.
Don't make me come in there.
Ya'll better listen.
I've been holding
something in all winter,
and I'm about to let it out.
- I'm up, I'm up!
- She means it. Let's go!
Thank you, Stella.
Oh, I can clear a room, Verne.
Come on, that much I can do.
- Good morning.
- Good morning, everyone!
- How'd you guys sleep?
- Just a super-duper morning.
Oh, jeepers.
Whoa, not lookin' so good
around the eyes there, hon.
Bucky and Quillo were up
every three or four weeks.
And Spike kept poking me.
Yeah. Well, he's kinda pokey.
He's the sharpest
of the bunch there.
You know what? How 'bout
I take the day shift?
Oh, Lou, that'd be just super.
All right, kids,
you heard your mother,
and now you listen to me.
Shape up.
Oh, boy. This is
what I was afraid of.
Where's the food? Is there
any left? I'm hungry,
so is there any left?
We ate all the food, Hammy.
During the winter? We gotta
go get some more now.
Oh, right! I buried
some nuts in the woods.
I know where they are.
I'll be right back. Bye!
- That's enough.
-  Dad,
it was just snow.
But it could have been
a predator.
Isn't playing dead
a little... weak?
Heather, how many times
must I say it?
Playing possum is what we do.
We die so that we live!
I'm the boss of you, OK?
So calm down.
That's what we need
to find you this year,
don't you know? A good fella.
- A good fella? A good fella?
- Uh-oh. Jeepers, here we go.
Why does everyone think
I need a man, huh?
I look like a nest
and smell like a swamp.
So when you find
a fella who's decent,
good with kids
and has no sense
of smell, call me.
- Um, hello?
- I don't care
who started it.
- Uh...
- Oh, look, food.
Well, I think you know
what this means.
- Verne.
- Just a minute, Hammy.
This means we were
nine berries away
from starvation.
Sorry.
That was a little intense.
I meant really serious
hunger pains.
Verne!
Not finished, Hammy.
Morning, Lou, Penny.
- Thanks.
- Hey, kids.
- What I want to tell you is...
- Verne!
I'm not done, Hammy.
If you have to go again,
just go.
OK. So all I'm saying
is we cut it a little close.
So this year we need
to make sure that
we fill the log...
- All the way to the top.
- Exactly. All the way
to the top.
- Because what are we?
- Foragers!
- And what do we forage?
- Food!
- Right.
- Super, Verne,
really super.
- OK, Hammy.
- Huh?
- What is it?
- What is what?
What is it you want to tell me?
Hmm? Oh. Oh!
What was it, what was it,
what was it, what was it?
Wait. Right on the tip
of my tongue. Oh, yeah!
There's a weird thing
I've never seen before.
It's really scary.
Follow me.
OK. Meeting called on account
of weird scary thing.
Let's go.
Hmm. Foragers...
Hammy, what weird thing?
Oh. That weird thing.
It never ends!
Whoa!
Hey!
It never ends that way too!
- Jeepers, Lou.
- Whoa.
Yeah, jeepers
is the word there, hon.
- I've never seen
anything like this.
- Man, that's big.
- What is this thing?
- Heather, no!
- I'm scared.
- Me too, Mama.
Shh! It's OK, it's just a...
What is this thing, Lou?
I... Well, it's a...
It's... Verne?
Well, it's, uh...
it's obviously...
some kind of bush?
I'd be less afraid of it
if I knew what it was called.
- Let's call it Steve!
- Steve?
- It's a pretty name.
- Steve sounds nice.
I'm a lot less scared of Steve.
Oh, great and powerful Steve!
- What do you want?
- I don't think
it can speak.
I heard that,
young man!
-
-
-  You get over here!
- OK.
Hammy, get back here.
- Steve is angry!
- It came from
the other side of Steve.
I mean the bush.
I mean... Jeez!
There's only one way
we're gonna find out
what this thing is,
and what this is all about.
I'm gonna go check it out.
Aah!
-
- Ay yai yai.
Uh... Aah!
Steve ate Verne!
All right, Steve,
you brought this on yourself.
Stella, don't!
I'm not eaten,
I just tripped.
I'm gonna go over there.
Just don't anybody move.
Kids, come on,
hurry up! You'll be late!
Gary,
come on, breakfast!
What is this place?
Oh, hey there, little...
-
- Ohh!
fella. Ugh!
Oh!
Hi.
Aah!
- Oh!
-
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!
Ow.
Whoa! Ohh!
-
No, I can talk.
I'm just driving.
-
-
Aaah!
-
- Verne's back.
- Verne!
- Jeepers!
- You OK?
- Help him up.
- What was over there?
- Freaky pink primates!
They must have come while we
were hibernating. It was awful.
They had wheels on their feet
and these sticks, and they were
whacking me with
these sticks like it was
some sort of sick game.
You should have died!
You should have
laid down and died.
- Dad.
- That's not
the worst part.
Half the forest is gone.
The oak trees
and the berry bushes,
they're just...
they're just gone.
- Jeepers.
- What'll we do for food?
How are we gonna live?
I don't know.
But here's what I do know.
We will be fine
as long as no one
goes over Steve again.
It's called a hedge,
and it is not to be feared,
my amphibious friend.
It is the gateway
to the good life.
Uh, I'm a reptile, actually.
But, you know,
it's a common mistake.
And, uh, you are?
Oh. Where are my manners.
I'm RJ.
Don't think I'm prying,
but I couldn't help
overhearing,
and I can shed a little light
on what this whole hedge
situation is about.
You see, what was
once mere wilderness
is now 54 acres
of man-made, manicured,
air-conditioned paradise.
Except for that
little-bitty speck.
You are here.
-
- No, no, that's a good thing.
You're hibernators, right?
You gather up food,
store it for the winter?
- Uh-huh. We fill the log!
- Hammy.
Really? This log?
This cave-like log?
- All the way to the top.
- Ozzie.
Let me ask ya,
how long's it take?
- You know, to fill the log?
- Two hundred and
seventy-four days.
- Ohh! Ever done it in a week?
- That's impossible.
Not if we work together.
You've got
the food gathering skills,
I've got the know-how,
- and they have the food!
- How much food?
Loads of food. Heaps of food.
Food out the wazoo!
Well, whatever kind of food
comes out of a wazoo,
I don't think
we're interested in eating.
I don't know,
the guy's making
a lot of sense to me.
- I think we should listen.
- Yeah, I'm OK with
wazoo food there.
No, you're not.
The tail is tingling.
- Why didn't you say so?
- Hold on, hold on.
The what is what?
When something doesn't
feel right, my tail tingles.
Let me tell you,
everything you've said so far
is driving my tail crazy.
Listen. Verne, right?
This isn't something
you need to be afraid of.
Well, I am.
And for good reason.
This is not a birthmark.
That's because you went
over there without a guide.
Thanks for stopping by.
We're not interested.
Not interested in
the most delicious food
you've ever tasted?
- No!
- Come on.
Not interested!
OK. I get it.
I understand.
This is something that
you're just not open to.
- Wow!
-
- Whoa!
-
- Oh, my!
- Jeepers.
What is that?
That, my friend,
is a magical combination
of corn flour,
dehydrated cheese solids,
BHA, BHT and good old MSG,
a.k.a., the chip.
Nacho cheese flavor.
- Over here!
Toss me one of those!
- More please! More.
Yeah, Verne, those were good!
It's all good.
And we're going
over there. Tonight!
Yeah!
Welcome to suburbia.
- Wow!
- Look at that!
Hey, Mom, look at us!
Look at us!
Oh, my!
Hon, look at this.
- Jeepers.
- How's that tail, Verne?
Listen, if anybody
in this family gets hurt,
I'm holding you responsible.
They're having a good time.
I'll take responsibility
for that.
- This is neat.
- Look at that.
- Hey, Spike, look at that.
- Hey, Verno,
I took a few clippings
out of my quills to do
a little comparison.
Look at this,
the grass seems to be
greener over here.
Verne, are you certain
you came to the same place?
Yeah, 'cause
the raccoon says...
OK, enough about him.
I get it.
So he can do a couple of tricks.
I mean, it's not like
he can walk on water.
Hey, everybody!
This way to the food!
- That thing's huge!
- What is that?
That is an SUV.
Humans ride around in it
because they are slowly
losing their ability
to walk.
- Jeepers, it's so big!
- How many humans
fit in there?
Usually? One.
Hi, this is Gladys Sharp.
Your president?
Of the homeowner's
association? Right.
- Jeepers.
- What is that?
Easy, easy, don't worry.
That's just a human being.
And they are just as scared
of us as we are of them.
Now, if a human does happen
to see you, just lay down,
roll over and give your
privates a good licking.
They love it.
The charter, which you signed,
says the grass is supposed
to be two inches,
and according
to my measuring stick,
yours is 2.5.
Could we just get
the food and go? Really,
do they have it or not?
Didn't you see it?
It was in the box. They've
always got food with them.
We eat to live,
these guys live to eat.
Let me show you
what I'm talking about.
The human mouth
is called a "pie hole."
The human being
is called a "couch potato."
That is a device
to summon food.
That is one of the many
voices of food.
That is the portal
for the passing
of the food.
That is one of the many
food transportation
vehicles.
Humans bring the food,
take the food,
ship the food,
they drive the food,
they wear the food!
That gets the food hot.
That keeps the food cold.
That...
I'm not sure what that is.
-
- Aah!
What do you know? Food!
That is the altar
where they worship food.
That's what they eat
when they eat too much.
That gets rid of guilt
so they can eat more food.
Food! Food! Food! Food!
Food!
So you think they have enough?
Well, they don't.
For humans,
enough is never enough!
-
- And what do they do with
the stuff they don't eat?
They put it in gleaming,
silver cans,
just for us.
Sweet jeepers.
- Dig in!
-
- Good, isn't it?
- OK.
- Wow.
- Share there,
everyone, share.
That's a diaper.
And that does come out
of a wazoo.
So, what do you think?
Was I right or was I right?
And these things
are just the scraps!
Wait'll you see
what comes in the boxes,
packages and cans!
I'm telling you,
stick with me,
and in one week
we will gather
enough food to...
- To feed a bear.
- What?
- Just a figure of speech.
-
Halt! Intruders! Intruders!
Get out, all of you.
What is it, baby?
- What are you doing?
- You said to lick our...
No! Nix that! Run!
- Run!
- Get outta here!
Run!
- Shoo!
- To the hedge!
Get out of here!
I just mopped this patio!
Filthy vermin!
Verne's right,
that was horrible.
- You kids OK?
- Stay close.
- We'll find other food, right?
- See? That's what
I was talking about!
These humans
don't want us around.
So we scared her,
and she overreacted.
No biggie.
No biggie? Oh, that is
what we call a biggie.
Come on, think about
the food. It was worth it
for that food, huh?
That stuff is to die for!
Let me rephrase that.
No, to die for.
You nailed that part.
Look, maybe our little
forest life looks primitive
to a guy with a bag.
- What?
- But I think I speak
for the whole family
when I say we want nothing
to do with anything
that's over that hedge.
- Oh, come on!
- I'm done.
You haven't even
tried doughnuts yet!
You wanna store fat?
That is the way
to store some fat.
You'll be sweatin'
through the winter!
- We'll eat the bark, right?
- OK, all right,
you guys sleep on it!
Good idea. I'm gonna
check back with you.
Shoot!
Almost had 'em.
-
Good night, Heather.
- Good night.
- Good night, Ozzie.
- Good night.
- Good night, Lou.
- Good night.
- Night, Penny.
- Good night.
- Good night, Hammy.
- Good night.
- Night, Bucky.
- Good night.
- Good night, Spike.
- Good night, Uncle Verne.
- Good night, Quillo.
- Night, Uncle Verne.
When we wake up,
only 273 days left
till winter.
- That's enough, Verne.
- Good night, 273.
Spuddies...
Cooler... Wagon...
Redder wagon.
Time's up, RJ.
But I have
six more days! No!
No! Aaah!
OK. Four paws, fur.
Still alive, still alive.
So, what are you saying?
You want me to take 'em
to his house?
- No.
- Then what are you saying?
Jimmy was pushing me
on the bus.
- He likes you.
- No way, he's a creep.
Next time he shoves you,
beat him up.
Yes!
OK, kids, dive in.
There it is.
Bark for breakfast!
- I want a doughnut!
- I want pizza.
No, you don't.
OK. This is great.
Granted, it takes
some time to chew.
But that...
That was very satisfying.
And, by the way,
lots of fiber in there too.
Mmm!
- Lots.
- I gotta admit,
that does look tasty.
What are you doing here?
I'm here to help you
with your...
foraging thing.
Look, Verne,
you said a word yesterday
about your little gang here.
It starts with an F,
do you remember what it was?
- Family?
- Right, right, that.
You know,
that got me right here.
You see, Verne, I used
to have all of that.
My own place,
surrounded by loved ones,
universal remote.
But then all that
went away with...
the weed hacker incident.
-  Oh, God.
- Oh, come here.
Yeah, that feels good,
doesn't it?
- Oh, brother.
- Jeepers, Verne.
We could always use
the extra hand there,
you know.
The weed hacker, Verne.
The weed hacker.
OK.
Not your problem.
I'll just go.
This is me...
going.
- Been nice.
- Don't hit.
Really nice
getting to know you.
Hey, I'm sure I'll see you
around the forest.
- Take care.
- All right, all right.
- Hey, uh, RJ?
-
You can... you can stay.
-
Come here, ya big lug!
- No.
I knew beneath this hard,
crispy outside
there was a soft,
nougat-y center in there.
- Do you mind if
I call you Uncle Verne?
- With every bone in my body.
Great. Hey,
can I work with Hammy?
Wanna help me find my nuts?
Very tempting, Hammy,
very tempting.
But first,
I want to show you this.
-
- You like this cookie?
Ohh ho ho ho!
- Well, this cookie's junk!
- I like a cookie.
Easy, easy. Don't worry.
I know where we can get
some cookies so valuable
that they are
hand delivered
by uniformed officers.
- The Doyles'
is the yellow house.
- They only ordered one box.
There they are.
America's most coveted
cookies.
Love Handles, Skinny Mints,
Neener Neeners
and Smackeroons.
- And guess what?
They're all yours!
- Hoo hoo! Aah!
Whoa, Hamilton.
Hold on there, fella.
I love your energy,
but you can't take 'em.
- You said they're mine.
- They will be,
if we successfully marry
your manic energy
to my brilliant plan!
- You with me, kid?
- I... I... I...
The I's have it!
Let's ride.
Mrs. Johansson
was allergic to chocolate.
- Really?
- Yeah, if she eats it,
- her face explodes
or something.
- That is, like, so unfair.
- Wait, wait.
How many boxes of...?
- Hey!
You stay away
from those cookies.
They're mine!
-  Ahem!
- Aah!
This guy's not coming, is he?
I don't want him to.
Oh, we have so much work to do.
Come on,
step into my office.
Now, listen up.
What we're going for here
is a vicious, man-eating,
rabid squirrel.
- Can you handle that?
- Um, excuse me?
Yes... Hammy.
OK. Rabbits aren't vicious.
They're all cute
and cuddly, so...
Rabid, not rabbit.
Oh... What?
- OK. So first we're
gonna muss the hair.
- Ow, ow, ow!
That's looking good.
All right, now we're gonna...
We're gonna
mat the fur a little bit.
A little puff on the tail...
Stop it! Puffier.
Liking that a lot.
Show me that wild look
in your eye. Come on!
- Oh! I can burp my ABCs!
A, B, C.
- Hammy!
I really need you
to focus right now, OK?
- OK.
- Thank you.
Let's see. There we...
Hang on a minute.
Not that, not that.
No, no. Aha!
- Nice!
- Ooh!
Hammy?
Done! Now, come on.
I'll be right behind you.
Go on, get out there.
Shoo, shoo!
I am a crazy rabid squirrel!
I want my cookies!
I'm rabid!
I'm foaming at the mouth.
I'm foaming,
very scary rabid squirrel.
Rabies!
- Hey, it's working!
- Behind you!
I know.
You're right behind me...
Got it! Stand back!
- No, no, no, no! Oh, no!
- Take that!
Walk it off!
Walk that one off!
What's going on?
Is that Hammy?
Everything's
under control. Go back.
You call that under control?
- He's under attack!
- He's working!
- I'm coming, Hammy!
- Verne! No!
What are you doing?
Watch out!
- Hold still!
I got it! Stay still.
- Help me! Get off of me!
- Yuck!
- Gross!
- Eww! Nasty!
- Eww, eww! Oh, my God,
this is so gross!
Verne! That was great!
You, my friend, are a natural.
Or, should I say, au naturel.
Huh?
Oh.
Hammy, you were awesome,
my man!
You had me scared.
I was about to come out and
beat you with a book myself.
You're all right, aren't ya?
Of course you are.
You are Hammy!
Those bruises are gonna heal.
You know what?
Chicks dig scars.
- There!
- Over there!
That's where
the squirrel attacked us!
He has rabies or something.
There was this gross,
naked, amphibian thing.
- Reptile.
- It's OK, girls.
Go inside, have a cookie,
turn on the TV
and calm down.
Thanks, Mom.
Sorry, Janis, did I hear
them say "rabid squirrel"?
Oh, I think they might
just be overreacting.
What if they're not?
What if we have a potential
pandemic on our hands?
Vermin running loose,
spreading disease
and lowering
our property values?
Yeah. I have a casserole
in the oven. Gotta run.
Fine. Worry about
your casserole,
and I'll worry about the end of
suburban peace and tranquility!
That's right. Don't push.
Plenty for everybody.
Got a box right over here
for ya, Penny.
That is good. Eat up!
Anything that tastes this good
has to be good for you.
Feel buzzing in the back
of your skull?
That's called a sugar rush.
It's what keeps humans going,
why they don't hibernate.
Add a little of this,
and what usually takes you
all summer will take us a week.
I like it! I like it!
Hold on, Hamsquad.
The last thing
you need is caffeine.
That's right.
Come on, dig in.
Because this, my friends,
is just the beginning.
What?
- Up, down! Up, down!
- He's getting away!
Oh, yeah!
Ohh!
Read it and weep.
Hello? I need every
business listing you have
under "exterminator."
-
- Ozzie!
- Whoa, Mom! You hit a possum.
- Oh, my goodness.
- Do you think it's dead?
-  Oh, no.
-  Wow!
- Touch it.
- Can I poke him?
- No!
These poor
little creatures.
- What's going on?
- Come check it out.
Debbie? I don't remember
seeing a permit app
for a gathering.
Groups of more than one
who wish to get... Aah!
Timmy, get the shovel
from the car.
Lights fading,
limbs growing cold.
-  I see a tunnel.
- Oh, no.
Mother, is that you
beckoning me into the light?
Must move toward the light.
- What do you think he's doing?
- Maybe we knocked
his brains loose.
You went too far.
Let's get out of here
and leave this...
This...
- Nice catch, Verne.
- Yes! Yes!
- You're dangerous.
You're insane!
- Sweet music, I'm going home!
Goodbye, cruel world!
Ooh! Ooh!
Rosebud.
- Now can I poke him?
- No!
You see? This is
exactly why I called
the exterminator.
To kill them before
they get hurt like this.
Everybody,
get out of here right now!
Right! Kids, grab those handles.
Get the stuff.
- What?
- Here we go.
I threw out my back.
- Let's go.
- Get down.
Oh, no.
I believe someone phoned
about an animal problem?
The solution
is standing before you.
Dwayne LaFontant is here.
Where have you been?
I'm throwing a "Welcome to
the Neighborhood" party,
and so far Debbie's car
has killed more animals
than you have.
Stand down, sister.
I personally guarantee
that there will not be
a living thing
at this party.
The Verminator is on the job.
Leave it. Leave it!
What do we have here?
Didelphis marsupialis
virginianus.
Approximately ten pounds.
-  Male.
-
- I think he's dead.
- Oh, really?
Do you, in fact, have an
associates degree from Vermtech?
I think he wants you
to think he's dead.
- Go! Go!
- Move, move!
- That's it! Run! Go!
- ...voluntary shock state.
Look at him closely.
You can see him breathing.
- I certainly hope
he's not in any pain.
-
- What the...?
- Aah! Kill it! Kill it!
Thank you all for coming!
You were a great audience!
Oh, man!
All right, what am I
up against here?
Possum, porcupine,
skunk, squirrel,
raccoon...
amphibian.
- Reptile.
- No.
Reptile.
That's what I call
a super-duper
performance there.
- I wanna do it again!
- Beyond super.
They were riveted.
You were awesome!
All right!
Dad. I just gotta say,
that was, uh...
that was pretty good.
Props for the Ozman!
- Ozman!
- Yeah! Yeah!
But let's not forget
our brilliant leadership:
RJ.
RJ!
Brilliant!
RJ, come this way.
We wanna show you something.
- Yeah, sure.
- Sweet.
- What a team!
- That raccoon knows
what he's doing.
You're my hero there,
fella.
- Over here, this way.
- RJ, come on!
Yeah, we wanna show you
something. Come on, hurry!
Check it out.
Your new home!
And look, we got
a place for you right here!
That's for me?
Yeah, is this anything
like what you had, RJ?
This isn't anything
like what I had, Lou.
- Here, I'm not
supposed to drink this.
- Thanks.
-
-
- Is that my bag?
- Yeah, we brought it in here
so you wouldn't have
to sleep in that tree.
Really? Wow.
Hey, RJ, check this out!
We totally hooked up the TV.
- I hot-wired the HD converter.
- We get a thousand channels!
Can you take the remote
before my dad does?
Wow. A universal remote?
This is nice, guys.
Really nice.
Dirtbag. I don't think
that guy's a real doctor.
What do you think there,
RJ? RJ?
Whoa. Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, RJ.
What are you doing, man?
You are getting in
way too deep.
Just get the food.
Feed the bear.
Get the food.
Feed the bear. Whaah!
Where's the food?
Where's the food?!
Verne.
What are you doing?
Getting things back
to the way they were.
- No, don't.
How about I just leave?
- Good.
You leave,
and I return this stuff
to the rightful owners.
What?! Why?
Because we've angered
the humans.
And we don't wanna end up
like that rabbit.
Hence, I'm giving this back
so they won't kill us.
Verne, you don't understand!
We need this stuff!
No, we don't!
- You can't take it!
- Yes, I can!
- Let go!
- You let go!
- I have to have it.
- No!
Stop!
Verne. Move slow,
keep your voice low
and follow me.
- What?
- Shh!
- No.
- Shh!
No. I'm not falling
for any more of your
smooth talk!
I don't know what
you're up to, but my
entire shell is tingling.
Know what? I'm listening
to it this time,
- and I'm putting
my foot down.
- No, no.
- Play?
- Huh? Oh! Huh?
Play! Play! Play! Play!
Play! Play! Play!
Play! Play!
Aaah! Oof!
Play!
Let's play!
Play!
Jeez... Aah!
Play! Play! Play!
Play! Play! Play!
- Down, boy. Sit.
Roll over!
- Play!
- Play dead!
- Play!
Attaboy, Verne. Save the food.
I'll lose the dog.
- Play.
- Huh?
Play, play, play, play.
Play, play, play, play.
Oh, no! No, no, no, no.
You're dropping
all the food, man!
- Here, catch.
- Play!
Are you hungry?
Look, food.
- Oh, my back!
- Whoa!
Look, people!
Play with them!
- Look out!
- Stop! What's he doing?
- What was that?
- Play, play, play, play.
I'm all right,
I'm fine. It's OK. It's...
Verne, unhook the chain.
Play!
No.
Yes.
Bad.
- Oh, boy.
- Wow!
Verne, I told you
to unhook the chain.
Garbage cans are not to be
on the curb before eight...
Aah!
You're the devil.
-
-  Ow! Oh! Ow!
No! No!
Verne, you all right there?
- Gimme a hand, Oz.
- Sure, sure.
- What happened?
- What happened?
It's gone.
The food! Gone!
- What?
- Gone?
- How's it gone?
- Ask him!
- Verne?
- I returned it
- to its rightful owner.
- What?
We, like, worked
our tails off, you know?
Like, a lot. And the food
we gathered was totally...
You know. And you're...
You're all, whatever.
Yeah, Verne,
what were you thinking?
The log was full!
- Full of junk.
- So, what are you
saying there?
That the food we gather
our way isn't as good as
the food we gather your way?
Your way?
You mean his way.
Can't you see RJ
is just using you?
Verne! Shame on you.
RJ wouldn't do that.
You have got
to trust me on this.
Don't you understand
there's something
wrong with him?
My tail tingles
every time I get near him.
So we're supposed to go hungry
because your butt's vibrating?
I'm starting to think
that tingle is just you
being jealous.
- Jealous? Of him?
- Yeah.
He's embracing the future there,
and you're just holding us back.
I hold you back, all right.
From extinction.
See what you've done here?
If they listened
to half the stuff
you're telling them,
they'll be dead within a week.
You are only interested
in taking advantage
because they're too stupid
and naive to know any better.
I'm not stupid.
OK, I didn't mean...
Uh...
I meant ignorant.
To the ways over...
over there.
Come on, you guys.
You know I didn't
mean it like that.
Don't... don't do this.
Stella? Ozzie?
Hammy?
You know I didn't...
- Hammy...
- I'm not stupid.
Please.
- Good night, Uncle RJ.
- Good night, kiddo.
Moon's full, RJ.
See ya in the morning.
This'll
cut you down to size!
I got ya!
-  Is it done?
- Affirmative.
Did you put this one in?
This Depelter Turbo?
That's a contraband item,
ma'am,
as it is illegal
in every state, except Texas.
I don't care if it's against
the Geneva Convention.
- I want it!
-
I thought you might.
So I took the liberty
of installing it for you.
-
- Adios, animal infestation.
- Aah!
-
Oh, my.
What have I done?
-  Shouldn't have
taken all that food.
- What?
I shouldn't have taken
all that food.
I was just
trying to return things
to the way they were.
I was just being cautious.
'Cause that's what I am.
I'm naturally tentative.
There's even places
in my shell I haven't been.
You, on the other hand,
you're like... cool.
And crazy and fearless.
I think they're right.
I think I'm just jealous.
Verne, believe me,
you should not be
jealous of me.
You got a good thing here.
You're trying to do what's
best for your family.
And I think you're
what's best for them now.
What about your tail?
My head says listen to my tail,
my tail says listen
to my head, and I just...
end up with an upset stomach.
That's why you need
to be in charge now.
- You don't know
what's going on.
- And you do.
- So, what's the problem?
- This, Verne,
is the problem.
- You see this?
- I'm listening.
- Just...
-
Just hang on a second.
All right?
I, uh...
- You throwing the party?
- Yes. To the right.
There are protective booties
to put on over your shoes.
Yes! Yes!
- Uh, what is this?
- What?
- Oh, that...
- Mm-hmm.
is a...
list of all the stuff
that you lost, Verne.
- Really?
- It's a big, long list.
You can see.
You're a... organized little
guy, aren't you? Nice job.
You know what?
I know a place
so chock-full of food,
we could get it
all back in one night.
Great. Let's go.
Where is it?
- Inside that house.
- What?
- What is the point
of this thing?
- Just send it down.
What Verne
is trying to say is...
I mean, it's hard
to really sum it all up
in just one word.
- But...
- I'm sorry.
Oh, come here.
- Oh, come here, Verne.
- That's right.
OK! Listen,
stay in the huddle.
Here's the plan.
Now, the traps are set
here, here, here,
here, here, here,
here, here, here,
here, here, here and here.
Here, here, here, here.
Big one here, here,
- and maybe a few over here.
- Gee, is that all?
No. There's a bunch
of red lights all over here.
OK, Verne?
Looking a little green.
I blacked out
for a second there,
but I get the idea.
There's lights, traps...
I might need
to change my shell.
OK, this is us.
- Can I be the car?
- I wanna be the car!
- I'm the car.
You be the shoe.
- The shoe is lame.
Why don't you be
that snazzy-looking iron?
Hey, it's not important!
Besides, I'm the car.
I'm always the car.
The plan works in three
simple steps. Step one,
kill the lights.
Step two, get inside.
Step three, get out
with mountain of food.
But this place
is like a fortress.
Walls, so high.
Doors, impenetrable.
- How will we get in?
- The collar is the key.
Literally, the collar.
It's like a key that opens
the door and if...
And what? You think
he's just gonna hand over
his collar to you?
Not to me,
my femme fatale. To you.
- Her?
- Me?
You, Stella, will get that cat
to give you
his collar by using...
- My stink.
- ...your feminine charms.
Was that out loud?
Look, raccoon, maybe
that mask you're wearing
is obstructing your view,
but if you haven't noticed,
I'm a skunk.
On the outside, maybe.
But I'm looking inside,
Stella, and I see a fox.
And all we gotta do
is get her out.
- Scissors.
- Scissors?
- Here we go.
- Watch the...
- Charcoal.
- Charcoal?
- Air freshener.
- Tomato juice.
- Cork.
- Cork? Don't you dare.
- Get 'em!
- Score! Yeah!
- One more thing.
-  Ow!
Stop. That's it.
Ladies and gentlemen,
our work here is done.
Oh, my.
- Big jeepers.
- She's all like, wow.
What?
Oh.
Meow.
- Whoa!
- Amazing!
Gosh, she looks...
Wow.
All right, gang, this is it.
We're going in.
Not again. Dang it!
Those things are so lifelike.
Curse you, plastic moldsman.
OK, Hammy.
Hammy!
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
Hammy, I told you
that cookie's junk!
But I like a cookie.
What's going on?
Is everything OK?
Ha ha! Here we go!
Come on, Hammy, come on.
Follow the pretty light.
There it is, that's it.
That's it, that's it.
There it is. Go get it.
Mm-hmm.
That's it, that's it.
Go get it, you little nut!
-
I thought we'd be dead
by step two,
so this is going great!
OK, gorgeous, you're on.
Man, this better be
one stupid cat.
Audio, go!
She's supposed to be a cat.
Put it on cat.
Maybe the cat likes a cow.
Who goes there?
You're a cat!
You're a cat!
You're a cat!
Uh, I mean, I'm a cat.
Uh...
- Meow.
- Yeah, right.
Shoo. Go on,
get away from here.
My owner does not give
scraps to common strays.
Common strays?
All right, you asked for it.
- Get the collar!
- Gee, that's a nice
collar you got on.
- Mind if I have a look?
- No! Come no closer!
I must not be
so near a creature
of the outdoor woods.
- Away with your filth!
- My filth?
- My filth?!
- Oh, jeepers, here we go.
OK, that's it. I am sick
and tired of everybody
taking one look at me
and running away
'cause they think I'm filthy.
Well, I got news for you.
I didn't get all primped
and preened to have some
over-fed, pompous puffball
tell me he's too good for me.
I got makeup on my butt, dude!
And you don't even
wanna know about the cork!
Stop! No one has ever
spoken to me like that!
It is bold. I like it.
Well, believe me,
there's more
where that came from...
- ...puffball.
- All right, team,
let's boogie.
You are strong.
Your essence is overpowering.
- What...?
What do you mean by that?
- It is your eyes.
- My eyes.
- They are luminous.
Luminous? Dang.
You know, I think
this is the part
where I blacked out.
Did the little shoes
and cars actually
get into the house?
- So you got a name?
- Yes.
It is a Persian name,
for I am Persian.
I was born Prince
Tigeriess Mahmood Shabaz.
Ooh, that's a mouthful.
Can I just call you Tiger?
- This place is huge.
- Wicked cool.
Animals are in the house.
Wow!
- Oh, my goodness.
- This is so cool.
- Yes! OK,
stations, everybody.
- Let's boogie!
- We got it.
- Here we go.
No grip, no grip, no grip.
- Hammy!
Less claw, more pad.
- Oh, OK.
That hurt.
Uh-oh.
- Just a minute,
I'll be right there.
- What was that?
It... That's just
the sound of my heart.
Can't you hear it?
Aaah!
This way, this way!
OK, OK, we're good.
Go back to work.
There ya go.
Here, catch!
Oh, boy.
Yes, I'm gonna make it.
My father, he had
an exceptionally flat face.
He was so beautiful,
he could barely breathe.
Fascinating.
inside, I have
a multi-leveled climby-thing
with shag carpet.
- Come, I show you.
- No, no!
I haven't told you
about my life.
Good, good.
Going great, going great.
-
What is that?
That is what gets the humans
out of bed in the morning.
-
- Where'd she go?
Get down and stay down.
Move. Move.
Come on! We've gotta go
before she comes back.
- No! Not without
those Spuddies.
- What?
Lou, Penny, back to the TV.
Heather, keep an eye
on that human.
- I'm on it, RJ.
- No, Heather. Wait!
The tingle, the tingle.
RJ! The wagon's full,
let's get out of here.
Hang on, Vincent,
this'll only take a second
- Vincent?
- Where?
- Who's Vincent?
- Oh, Verne, Vincent.
Simple slip of the bear.
Tongue! I... er...
Just bear with me is what
I meant to say.
There's no bear.
Lights fading.
Limbs growing co...
Heather.
Oh, Heather!
There's a dead, white rat
on my staircase.
I thought you were dead.
I learned from the best, Dad.
That's my girl.
Come to Papa.
We better hurry.
We don't have much time.
- What's going on, RJ?
- Nothing!
Let's get out of here
because we have
what we need.
- No, we don't.
- What are you
talking about?
- We have more than enough.
- Hey, listen.
I've got this long
to hand over that wagon
of food to a homicidal bear.
If these Spuddies aren't
on the menu, then I will be.
Now let go of my tail.
- What?
- Let go!
Hey, whoa!
- Huh?
-
Uh, I'm sorry, I've gotta go.
Stella, Stella,
where are you going?
Stella!
- Aaah!
- Stella!
Look, it's not you.
It won't work, OK,
because I'm a...
Skunk!
Yeah, that. Sorry
you have to see this.
Fire in the hole!
-  Oh, my...
- This smell
doesn't bother you?
No. This face
was bred for beauty.
I cannot smell a thing.
You can't smell?
To the door!
Go, go, go, go, go, go!
- Run!
- This way!
Let's party.
- Bunnies!
- Aah!
Flee, my love.
Run, that way. Outside!
- Move, kids! Come on!
-
Buenos días, reptile.
You've just been verminated.
Whoa! You stink.
That's because you let them
into my... house!
- Those...
- Hey, Nancy,
stop your honkin'.
These little guys
will be disposed of
quickly and humanely.
No! Not humanely.
As inhumanely as possible.
It was a pleasure
doing business
with you, ma'am.
- What's he gonna do
to us, Mama?
- I don't know, baby.
I don't wanna die, Dad.
Not for real.
There, there, there,
sweetheart. We'll be OK.
You were right about him,
Verne.
We shoulda listened.
Sorry there.
No.
I knew we couldn't trust him,
and I got us into this.
I should've known better.
-  Wow!
- Vincent?
So I was on my way
down here to kill you.
But I stopped to watch the show,
and I gotta say...
that, right there,
is a thing of beauty.
That is the most vicious,
deceitful,
self-serving thing
I've ever seen.
Classic RJ.
You take the food,
and they take the fall.
You keep this up,
you're gonna end up
just like me.
Having everything
you ever wanted.
But I already had that.
What, them?
Who are you kidding?
You said it yourself,
you're a family of one.
Always will be.
It's how guys like
you and me survive.
So a few saps
got hurt in the process.
Tough. That's life.
Trust me, you don't need them.
Actually, I do.
And right now,
they really need me.
- So I really need this!
-  RJ!
-
-
What the...?
- There goes my back again.
- Are you OK?
You sorry sack of rat dung.
Whoa, Stella,
this is a rescue.
I'm rescuing you.
I'm gonna gas you so hard
your grandchildren'll stink.
-  Bear!
- What's that?
- Bear!
- Hair?
- Bear!
- Dare?
- Bear!
- Oh, bear!
What?
- We're out of control!
- We can drive.
- It's just like
Auto-Homicide 3!
- What?
Verne, let me in!
Wrong button! Wrong button!
Take us home!
Take us to the log!
We got it!
- Hammy! Let me in!
- Not listening to RJ.
- Kids, lose that bear!
- What weapons do we have?
- We've got a hammer.
- Cool.
You little...
Thank you. Yes, yes! Hey!
- Let me in, let me in!
- No! Ring-tailed charlatan!
Ozzie!
He's trying to help us.
Just let him in.
- After what he did to us?
- But he came back.
And he brought a bear.
Hey! No fighting
while we're driving.
We will turn this van
around, mister.
He started it.
I'm telling you,
he's trying to help us.
But, Verne, you're
the one who always says
trust your tail.
- But it's not tingling.
-  Oh!
- Why didn't you say so?
-  Hey!
Thank you, thank you.
- You're dead, RJ!
- Duck!
- And your friends are next.
- Look out!
Whoa!
Bonus points!
-
- Huh?
Yeah!
Ohh!
RJ!
- Yeah!
- Oh!
- Look out.
- High score.
No, no, no, no!
Everybody all right?
- Come on!
- We've gotta go,
we've gotta go!
The old jazz dance injury.
- Come on, come on. Quillo!
- Go, go, go.
- Did we make it?
- That was close!
- All right!
- Are we here?
Penny? The kids here?
Hammy?
Scary clown.
-
- Look out!
-
-
A weed hacker, Verne.
A weed hacker!
- Hey!
- Up, up, go up.
Show your little rat faces.
Filthy creatures.
Stay in the woods
where you belong.
Watch out!
-
You guys wanna party, do ya?
All right, then, let's party.
- Mom!
-  Kids!
Penny, Lou,
look out! Down!
That's it! Verne,
get everybody out of here.
I'll distract him.
- Are you crazy? He'll kill you.
- Well, I'm the one he wants.
Take care of your family,
Verne.
I intend to.
The whole family.
- There's got to be
something we can do.
- There's no time.
Hammy!
-  Ahh.
-
Hey, Vincent.
You were right.
With a Spuddie,
enough just isn't enough.
RJ!
Now, Hammy. Go, go, go!
OK...
I got the cookie.
- Huh?
- Ohh.
- That's the...
- The Depelter Turbo.
Prepare for a lot of stinging.
Oh, no!
No, no! No, no! No!
- Ouch!
-  My hair!
That stung
like I knew it would!
-
-
-  Yeah!
- All right!
Good job, everybody.
That's teamwork.
Come here, Hammy, come here.
You are a genius, my boy.
Oh, thank...
you.
And, Verne, don't you
ever fix this shell!
Yeah.
Glad it's working for ya.
Take it off, give it back.
-
- Here we go, off to
the Rockies for you, Smoky.
Now, you do realize
that was a Depelter Turbo?
Officer, please.
It was that Verminator.
He sold it to me.
This has nothing
to do with me.
Hey, hey, it was in your yard.
Your name's on the contract,
so tell it to the judge.
- No! It's not my fault!
Let go of me!
- Ma'am...
I can't be arrested!
I'm the president of
the homeowner's association!
Take her down!
She's getting away!
- We got a twitcher!
Watch it! Ma'am!
- Get her!
- Stop that!
- Can I get help over here?
Somebody get a hold
of her legs!
-  Play?
-  Oh, no!
- No, no! No, no! Aah!
-
High five, Hammy!
- Yes!
- It worked!
We did it!
- Oh, yes!
-  Stella!
- Stella!
- Over here, Tiger.
Oh, Stella.
So this is the outdoor
woods? I like it.
Come on, big boy.
You're coming with me.
You know, RJ, um,
just for the record,
if you had told us
that all that food
you were trying to get
was to pay back an angry bear,
we would've given it to you.
- Really?
- Yeah, that's
what families do.
They look out for each other.
I've never had
anything like that.
I know.
But believe me, this...
This is the gateway
to the good life.
Wish you would've
told me that sooner.
Well, that's bad communication.
Also something families do.
So, what do you say?
You wanna be a part of it?
Come here, come here.
I promised
I wouldn't do this. OK.
Welcome to the family!
- Hey!
- Group hug!
OK, OK.
What a first week of spring.
Wait a minute!
That means there's only
What are we gonna do for food?
Oh! Oh, oh, oh, oh!
Oh, oh, oh!
Yes, Hammy.
I filled the log.
-  Jeepers!
-  What...?
Look, look!
I found my nuts! Oof!
That, my friends,
is the object of all human
attention and devotion.
- And they call it a TV.
-  Wicked cool!
Humans feel an inner
need to connect with
the world around them.
That is super-duper.
They also feel a need
to sit on their fat butts.
Watching TV fulfills
both needs at the same time.
Wow. Interesting.
Come on, kids.
Family time there,
in front of the TV.
Got your snack food?
Buy a vowel.
Buy a vowel!
Buy a "Y". Please buy a "Y".
-
I can't find the remote.
-  Hey, Spikey, race ya!
- Has anybody seen the remote?
-  Dad, chill.
I could do a little TV.
Today's the day we find out
if the baby is gifted
or if Saxon is really an alien.
Like Khan
in Star Trek II!
The Genesis Project
was in the hands
of the Enterprise,
but Khan had his plan
to steal the invention!
Well,
that was specific.
I saw it on TNT,
a retrospective.
-  Gummi Worm, anybody?
-  Let me have one.
Bucky,
pass this to Lou.
-  Taste this.
-  Don't you take that.
- This is the perfect food.
-  Fat-free cookies?
