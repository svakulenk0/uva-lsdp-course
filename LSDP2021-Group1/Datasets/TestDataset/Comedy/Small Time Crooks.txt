SUBTITLES RIPPED BY DreamingInsomniac
Oh, baby,
what I couldn't do, ooh
With plenty of money
and you, ooh
In spite of the worry
that money brings
Just a little filthy lucre
buys a lot of things
And I could take you
to places you'd like to go
But outside of that
I've no use for dough
It's the root of all evil
Of strife and upheaval
But I'm certain, honey
That life could be sunny
-
- May I help you?
I'm looking for
a box of chocolates.
Something fancy, if you have it.
- Is it a gift?
- Yeah.
I want something fancy
and not too rich,
because she tends to put on
a little blubber, the wife.
- Uh-huh.
- On the thighs.
What about this one?
It's kinda rich.
- It's from Belgium.
- Er, from Belgium?
- It's very pretty.
- Yeah.
Hey, Frenchy, I'm home!
Who's that?
Who do ya... It's the Pope!
I wanted to see your apartment.
- Who comes home every night?!
- I'm watching Princess Diana.
Again? How many times
you gonna do that?
Look at those clothes.
I told you time and again,
she got all that stuff discount.
It's a known... Hey, here,
I got you some chocolates.
Chocolates?
You heard of chocolates?
I got you chocolates.
- How come?
- Whaddya mean?
They're from Belgium,
handmade by Belgiumites.
Tell it to the Marines. You get
caught hitting on a waitress?
Hey, in 25 years of marriage
have I ever hit on anybody but you?
Hmm, well, I don't buy it, Ray.
You got a scheme.
OK, forget it. Get me
dinner. They're not for you!
- OK.
- I got you nothin'.
Just get my dinner, right now.
And hurry up.
Before you make dinner,
I gotta talk to you.
What did I tell you?
Here comes the commercial.
Frenchy, I need our $6,000.
- What?!
- I gotta have our six G's.
- That's our savings.
- Don't get dramatic about it.
Ray, that's all we got, right?
I got a brilliant idea.
I'll make us rich.
How? You gonna rob a bank?
How'd you know that?
That's fantastic.
- What?
- First shot, you got it.
Is that why Tommy Beale's
coming over, and Denny?
What if I told you you were
married to a very brilliant man?
I'd say I'd have to be a bigamist.
This is foolproof - foolproof!
You said you were finished with that.
I was, but I've been kicked
from stupid little job to job.
- You like the way we live?
- It beats your old residence.
You think I like looking at you
through glass talking over a phone?
Frenchy, you stood...you stood by me!
- Yeah...
- Granted, you stood by me.
Two years I waited,
and what did I get?
You got Belgian chocolates!
What's wrong with that?
God, I got an idea, this is
so incredible, but I need money.
We need seed money for this,
we need 18,000 bucks.
Denny and Tommy kick six
and I gotta put in my six.
- How can those bums get that?
- They didn't go to Harvard but...
They were drafted before
they finished kindergarten!
You're such a snob, Frenchy!
Denny's not stupid
because he drives a truck!
No, he's stupid
because he has a low IQ.
- I'd like to flatten you once.
- Oh, yeah...
Tommy's got street smarts.
Yeah, his brain's got potholes.
She's got an answer for everything.
Forget it!
I'm not spending our last bucks!
I got my end! I said I could.
Well, he can't get his end.
Frenchy, I gotta have that money.
Yeah, maybe if you
needed a Quadruple bypass.
- This is brilliant!
- No, Ray is a genius.
Compared to you,
this chair is a genius.
No, this is the plan of a great mind.
I can't believe
you're just a dishwasher.
Thank you.
I don't get your agreeance,
I count to three...
You can count to 53, I did
a lot of nails for that money.
That's all you wanna do? Nails?
- Take a hike, OK?
- Frenchy, I-I'm countin'...
- Oh, yeah?
- If I lose it, you're gone.
I'm Quaking.
- You're embarrassing me!
- How did you get a cookie?
- One cookie?
- Hey, guys!
- Got your share?
- Share of what?
- Yeah, I sold some stuff.
- What?
- A rented car.
- He can't get his.
- What are you tellin' him?
- The candy didn't work, then?
Will you shut up?!
All that's missing from him
is some velvet and a pet mouse.
Frenchy, gimme the money.
I wouldn't invest it on a legit idea,
much less something
that'll land you back in stir.
You said you call the shots.
For God...
Will you knock it off? Jesus...
- Frenchy, that money's mine.
- It's MINE, I earned it.
- But I'm your husband...
- Take a hike.
Frenchy, I... I'm gonna get violent.
Oh, yeah? With your hernia?
Fellas, I can't do it,
it's over. Forget it.
But you said you're the boss.
Stop telling me what I said!
Frenchy, it's over.
Let the bank lay there,
let someone else do it.
I-I gotta get some air on the roof.
Don't jump, you're
too valuable as a dishwasher!
Knock it off!
Can I have another cookie?
No!
All right, tell me your idea.
I told you my idea. You shot it down.
You gonna tell me or have a tantrum?
You know, for some reason you're
always shooting down my dreams.
Because your dreams
are like the ones people get
from putting opium in brownies.
Can I just tell you this?
You're not a bank robber.
Your two-year vacation proved it.
Not as a stick-up man, that's all.
When I hit that bank that time,
we were inexperienced,
the whole group of us
all put on Ronald Reagan masks
so it was confusing,
I didn't know who was who.
You're lucky your lawyer
knew the judge!
Can I tell you my idea?!
'A few weeks ago, a couple
of doors down from the bank,
'a pizza joint there folded
and it's for rent, Frenchy.'
And then it hits me,
and believe me, I'm no genius...
Yeah, you don't have to sell me.
..but I figure we tunnel under,
take the pizza joint,
we come up under the bank vault.
I know the layout cos I used to
know a guard - I got diagrams.
We clean out the vault,
we go to Florida.
Ray, we're poor but we're happy.
No, you're always complaining.
Are you happy doing cuticles?
Is that what you want?
Mother said never get involved
with a guy from the rackets.
Frenchy, what's wrong? We had dreams.
What's gotten into you?
Did...did we not have dreams?
When we met, yes, granted,
I was in rackets.
I was running numbers,
you were an exotic dancer,
your parents didn't approve.
I tried to go legit, OK?
- I know.
- What do you want me to do?
'B-but this pizza place
is just waiting for us.'
Ray, it's gonna look suspicious,
a group of guys
drilling in an empty store.
No, that's where you come in,
you front it.
- What?
- You front it, you make pizzas.
I can't cook pizzas!
So cook cookies!
What's the difference?!
Tell fortunes, you look like a
gypsy, make it a travel agency.
You work there and
we tunnel under into the bank.
- God...
- Frenchy, come here.
- You see how beautiful this is?
- Yeah.
What you see,
it's not just New Jersey.
When we first met there was
a sunset just like this, very...
- Remember?
- Mm-hm. Yeah.
But in Columbia
there was an earthQuake!
Sorry, the location
was taken by someone else.
What?!
Yesterday. I told you,
if you waited too long...
Who did? Wh-who took the place?
Can you give me...? You got the name?
Mrs Neddy Goldberg.
Oh, Jesus. For what?
I believe a flower shop.
A flower shop?
It's a little old lady,
her husband just died and she
wants to start a flower shop.
Somebody's got to get to her.
- Get to her what?
- Beg her, con her.
I'll go to her shop and threaten her.
- No, you can't.
- Don't do that.
I gotta talk to her.
And say what? If her husband
just died, you need a plan.
I don't know. I'll charm her.
What are you gonna use
for charm, Ray?
Knock it off.
Some master plan, you lost the lease.
I'll get it,
that's what this is about.
You're gonna rob a bank and some
little old lady has it first.
Very funny, what...you...you...
I'll slam your head off.
- Hey!
- Jesus.
The bank isn't even
next to the pizza joint.
I told you that before!
That's what's great...
- What?
- There's nothing suspicious.
The only thing suspicious
is your sanity.
And when did you guys
ever dig a tunnel?.
It's no big deal.
You underestimate Ray's personality.
He's the most likeable
dishwasher I ever met.
Don't pay any attention to her,
we're gonna proceed.
- Uh...
- Yeah?
I'm looking for Neddy Goldberg.
Who wants her?
Uh, I got something for her.
I wanna make her a big offer.
Big dough. BIG dough.
Come in.
I'm Neddy Goldberg.
I know you...
You're...you're Benny,
from cell block eight!
- Oh...oh, God, Ray!
- Ray!
- Ray! How are you?
- You look like I'm a stranger!
I'm sorry, come on in.
- It's a small world.
- You leased that empty store?
Yeah, I'm gonna open a flower shop.
- What you gonna do with that?
- Burn it down.
You're still burning
stuff down for insurance?
That's how I sent
two kids through college.
There's no money in that!
That's... You... Benny,
you gotta come in with us.
- Who's us?
- What?
Why are you so suspicious?
It's me, Ray...
Remember my nickname in the joint?
- The Brain?
- The Brain.
That's what they called me.
But Ray, that was sarcastic.
No, that was real.
- No, it was sarcastic.
- There was nothing sarcastic!
- No, it was.
- Benny, it was real.
- I was...
- It was sarcastic.
- It wasn't sarcastic...
- Oh, God. Oh, God!
- I was The Brain!
- It was sarcastic!
Fellas, this is Benny. He's in.
- Benny? Looks like a cop to me.
- How you doin'?
You know you're workin'
with a genius?
We're all smart,
but he wears glasses.
Yeah.
W-what's good? Pine, right?
Oak, redwood. Redwood is what
woodpeckers peck on.
It's supposed to be the strongest.
- Good trees, right?
- Yeah.
- This looks good.
- Whoa, look how long it is.
We could build a house.
- We're just building a tunnel.
- Whoa.
- Or, like, a house.
- Yeah.
How much is that?
- 1,000 bucks.
- 1,000 bucks a box? Jesus!
- How many sticks in a box?
- 50.
My God, this is...this is
robbery. This is unbelievable.
What do we need this dynamite for?
What? Just be careful...
I don't like the colour...
Ohh, phew!
Can I have one of these?
Uh, OK.
- One of these?
- Mm-hm.
- OK, you want a bag?
- No, that's OK.
I haven't got a bag.
You'll take 'em like this?
It's a lot of work,
but when it's over we're all
gonna be well compensated.
Who's gonna work the drill?.
- What do you mean?
- I don't know how to.
There's nothing to that.
Whoever's working it, I tell ya,
it's gonna make a lot of noise.
No, no, hey,
what do you think this is?
We wrap this blanket around it,
it's fine.
No, no, you gotta know
how to work that.
Whoa! Shut it off!
Guys, shut up! What did you do?!
- We ain't started yet.
- What are you waitin' for,
the drilling season?
Do me a favour,
go upstairs and bake, will ya?
You know,
I-I don't need any help.
Got it?
You better brace me.
You said you were fine!
What are you doing?!
Get that thing! Get that thing!
- Got it?!
- Yeah, I got it!
I can't hold it!
I'm gettin' out of here!
I can hear somebody in the store!
Could we have half a dozen
of the chocolate cinnamon?
We're closed. For Easter.
That was three months ago.
- Greek Easter.
- That was two months ago.
Chinese Easter!
I'd like a cookie for my daughter.
- Honey, what kind?
- All right!
Have a cookie.
Yeah, sure, take a cookie.
- How you doing?
- Oh...hi!
- You still open?
- Yeah, yeah, sure.
- Two cherry cinnamon.
- Cherry cinnamon, right.
- New here, huh?
- Just opened today.
What's all that noise?
That's...the cookie press.
It needs oil.
There's...
a slight leak...downstairs.
- This is the plumber.
- There's a tiny leak.
- What do I owe you?
- Oh, no charge.
- Thanks a lot. Take it easy.
- I gotta get some sandbags!
Oh, the cookies are 85 cents for...
- Get the sandbags!
- Relax, you're a perfect fit!
- Where are the sandbags?!
- Just relax!
OK, so we got off to a shaky start.
Yeah, I'd say it was shaky, yeah.
Frenchy, there's gonna
be glitches, so what?
Tomorrow I'll bring a bathing suit.
I'm not discouraged,
cos I don't get discouraged.
There was a woman on before,
she's got 200 pairs of shoes.
You'll get yours Frenchy,
I promise you.
This time in a month or two
we'll be in Miami,
it'll be great.
"A patron of the arts",
don't that sound great?
- Frenchy...
- Opening night at the opera.
I love you, Frenchy, you know why?
Because you back me all the time.
You know when I first knew
I loved you?
This was a long time ago
if you remember.
Remember I taught you
how to open a safe
by listening to the tumblers,
and you got it.
- That's when I knew.
- You're a very romantic man,
and I'm very lucky because
not many wives get to see
their husbands battling
a ruptured water main.
- I'm crazy about you.
- I'm crazy about you.
- Here, Benny.
- Benny, put it in the bag.
- You... I'll...
- He puts it in the bag.
- This is efficiency.
- Hurry up!
What... Why are you putting
it in his shovel?.
- He puts it in.
- It's called efficiency.
It saves energy.
- Chocolate chip, please.
- Here.
Little girl, what do you want?
- Chocolate fudge.
- OK. You can only have two.
What are you stopping for?
Why? I'm trying to figure this out!
According to this,
we're supposed to take a left turn.
That doesn't mean stop! Let's go!
Will you give me a...
What the hell are you doing?
- What?
- You got your hat on backwards.
Yeah, so?
The flashlight goes in the front!
But it looks cooler like this.
What are you, a jerk?
It's a lot more stylish
than that - look at that!
- You think so?
- Yeah, turn it around.
This is chic.
Yeah, look at that. That's cool.
You got a mirror?
No, I don't. That looks good,
I'll show you when we get out.
Can you keep going, please?
I'm trying to figure the map out!
You want two?
OK, OK, everybody hold on.
That's 1.70, that's it.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
OK, here...chocolate chip...
What you
gonna do with your share?
How much is my share?
Well, I figure
there's gotta be two million,
I'm counting the jewellery too.
Divided four ways,
that's a half million bucks apiece.
- What about Frenchy?
- She's just a front.
But without her we're dead.
Any broad could sell cookies.
I say she gets a share
but not a full share.
I'd go for that.
What if we each get a fourth
and she gets, like, a third?
- She'd be getting more than us.
- How you figure?
Where you gonna get
four-fourths and a third?
- I don't do fractions.
- Let's not get greedy.
Remember that Bogart movie
where they're digging for gold?
They find the gold and then
this guy turns on his friends.
- Let's not let that happen.
- And he's killed by Hispanics.
- The Treasure Of...
- Treasure Island.
- Right! That was a good movie.
- The best.
OK, folks, here's the deal.
I'm out of cookies, OK?
It's gonna be another two minutes.
That's the way the cookie crumbles.
I've got one cookie left, you
know who's gonna eat this? Me.
I gotta put on help.
Help?
Yeah, I can't handle the volume.
What...? A second person?
I can't help it, Ray,
the cookies are selling.
Gee, I never counted on that.
You gotta manage it somehow.
What about my cousin May?
We can trust her.
May's a dodo,
I bring a dodo into a master plan?
- She's not a sQuealer.
- But we'd have to cut her in.
The pot's getting
smaller and smaller.
Well, I can't cook and sell at
the same time, it's a madhouse,
we'll get caught.
Hey, you know what we could do?
May... We could hire May and
not tell her what we're doing.
And she...she'll never catch on.
She's got, you know, and...
We're making enough
from the cookies to pay her.
Absolutely, she'll never figure
out or catch wise to anything.
If you think Denny's slow,
your cousin May is dumb like a...
like a horse
or a dog or something.
Maybe it's not such a great idea.
No, I think...
I think we could do it.
- Where are we?
- Supposed to be here.
Excuse me!
Where's the sugar?
Frenchy wants sugar.
May, stop bothering us,
we're busy here.
I just don't understand the drilling.
I told you, business is good,
we're expanding.
Yeah, a little tea shop so people
can eat cookies and drink tea.
Where are they gonna
drink the tea, in the tunnel?.
I'd explain it but you gotta
understand engineering.
What's engineering?
May, do me a favour,
I told you, we're expanding.
But there's a nail shop next door.
- We made a deal with them.
- You're expanding into there?
May, get your stuff.
You want the sugar... Take a hike.
Get the sugar and go, we'll call you.
This broad's big trouble.
Is it safe having that broad around?
She's harmless.
I think
we've made a wrong turn.
Oh, please! Give me the map.
- What're you talkin' about?
- For God's sakes.
This is fine, I don't know
what you're in a dither about.
- You're holding it upside down.
- I am?
You were reading this
upside down all along?
Get off my back.
Can I help it
if they print these things like this?
OK, thank you very much.
I gotta get another plate
of the...cherry...
- Can I help you? Next?
- I'm coming right back.
Can I get two cherry cinnamon?
How you doin'?
We're doin' something right!
Two cherry cinnamon.
- You new here, huh?
- No, this is my first day.
These are the greatest cookies
I ever tasted.
- Oh, really? We're expanding.
- No kidding?
Yeah, some guys are
working right now,
- tunnelling under next door.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- Did you try the fudge?
We were talking about
what a success this place is.
- About the restaurant.
- What restaurant?
You know, the guys in the back
tunnelling under the nail shop?
- What are you talking about?
- The tea room.
May, come here!
We're at the Sunset Bake Shop
where the lines wait patiently
for the most
fabulous cookies in New York.
What's goin' on here?!
And you're the heart
of Sunset Cookies, Miss...?
Frenchy Winkler.
Frances, but everybody
calls me Frenchy.
Standing here, one can inhale
the aroma of chocolate, cinnamon
and a dozen other
mouth-watering taste treats.
Is it true customers wait
half an hour for a cookie?
That you've rationed sales?
Well, it happened once but...
what's all the fuss?
Where did you learn
the secret of your baking?
It's all I can cook, that and
linguine with turkey meatballs.
Sir, how is your cookie?
I don't know, it's baked
with nutmeg or something.
But it's great.
And we're expanding, there are
men in the back tunnelling...
No, no, May! Get back!
I can't take this, Frenchy!
We don't want this attention.
I didn't hire a publicity agent,
they just showed up.
I know, but it's putting us
in the toilet!
I can't concentrate,
there's people demanding cookies,
and Denny got bit by a rat,
he needed rabies shots.
- Who, the rat?
- Funny. You should be on TV.
I am! Open your eyes!
Frenchy, I don't like this.
You've been digging for weeks,
when you gonna get somewhere?
It's complicated,
we keep getting lost!
The other day I was in deep
and my hat went out.
- That stupid coal miner's hat?
- It's a life-saver, that bulb!
We'd do better
just with a cookie store,
we're making good dough.
Hey, making good dough!
It's a cookie store
but we're making dough.
- We're making dough but...
- I get it.
I knew
we were going the wrong way!
What are we doin' in a dress shop?
At least it's a Sunday,
we can patch this up and get out.
- Patch it up?!
- Tile it!
- I'm not a tiler.
- We don't have any tiles!
Where do you get cement
in a dress shop?
Besides, BRAIN, how can you
close the hole and tile it?
We're inside the store!
How do we get out?
Well... He's got a point.
You can't tile it from that side.
- No kidding.
- No, you can't.
This is very discouraging, guys,
I'm ready to pack this in.
Everybody freeze!
Ray, your wife's cousin
talks too much.
Sorry to spoil
your expansion plans...
Officer, listen,
we didn't do anything yet.
It's true,
we were gonna...rob the bank
but we screwed up everything
except for the cookie shop,
that's doing great,
you like the cookies!
Let us forget all this and just
concentrate on the cookie store.
Hey, look, I'm not trying
to ruin anybody's life, OK?
Then, give us a break.
Think I could get
a piece of the action?
I don't mind paying off the cops.
It's a standard business expense.
Don't think of it as a pay-off.
I think I'm Qualified
to make a major contribution
to this whole enterprise.
My brother-in-law
majored in business.
Let us hear this contribution.
- One word.
- Yeah, and that word is?
Franchise.
'We got about 600 trucks
and we're all over the country
'and Canada, and we make
a lot of different cookies now.
'We got pistachio,
we got pretzels,
'we make chicken chip cookies,
tuna mint...'
'Virtually overnight,
'the Winklers and associates have
gone from a small cookie shop
'to something approaching
a baking empire.'
This is where we
package everything, you know?
And, uh...we, uh...the cookies
have a wonderful fresh smell
and that's put on
with a chemical spray.
We do that here.
There's no denying
he's refreshingly down-to-earth
for a corporate executive.
In fact, Sunset Farms
has captured the imagination
of the public and the industry.
We wondered
what the competition thinks,
so we went to American Cookies.
The bottom line is
they make a great product.
And everything else pretty much
takes care of itself.
This is your office?
Yeah, this is where I operate.
Frenchy decorated this place,
she's got...all her stuff here.
This is an antiQue, you know.
She says it's Louis the...
I don't know, Louis XIV, or XV.
I don't know how high
the Louis go, actually,
but it's a top Louis, one of the...
And Frenchy
stuck a TV in it, you know,
because she's got a...you know,
she's a creative decorator.
It's very original.
Um, how much are you worth?
Oh, plenty. Plenty.
- How much? Between you and me.
- A lot.
I mean, whatever you see is antiQues.
You know, this thing here,
this is from the Renaissance
or the Magna Carta or something
but that's where it's from.
Why did you decide to go
into baking so late in life?
Well, Frenchy, we found out,
can make cookies.
'The Frenchy
they're talking about
'and culinary genius
of Sunset is Frances Fox,
'the wife of the CEO.'
So everybody told you how
delicious your cookies were?
- I thought they were BSing me.
- Really?
Yeah, cos someone gives you
something they cooked
you always say you enjoy it even
if you threw up, so, you know.
In an age where everyone has
public relations handlers
it's hard to imagine
a group more direct
and less image-conscious
than Sunset Farms.
Each person we met seemed
more eccentric than the last,
like Tommy Walker, the chairman.
Frenchy makes the best cookies
in the world. We're very proud.
What are your duties as chairman?
The board meets twice a week
and we take up issues.
Issues?
Yeah, facts, problems,
things like that.
What problems does an overnight
success like Sunset Farms face?
Last week the toilet on
the fourth floor wouldn't flush.
The water kept coming to the top,
so the board voted
on getting a plumber.
'An architect of Sunset Farms'
unorthodox marketing strategy
'is head of advertising,
Denny Doyle, a former truck driver.'
Did you have the idea to advertise
in Playboy, Penthouse and Hustler?
I figured if a guy's staring
at a naked piece of tail,
he sees the breasts and
the legs, he's gonna salivate.
So if he's salivating
and turns the page
and comes across
a picture of our cookies,
he thinks maybe
that's why he's drooling.
It's psychology. It's science.
It's like Pablo's theory,
with the dog when he feeds him?
- Pablo?
- Pablo, with the dogs.
'Then there's
ex-police officer Ken Deloach,
'in charge of distribution.
'And Benjamin Borkowsky,
in charge of plant safety.'
I made sure
the building was fireproof.
'And lest they be accused
of being a male club,
'May Sloane handles public
relations and physical therapy.'
I understand public relations,
but physical therapy?
Well, all the chocolate chips
are put in by hand
and that's really hard
on the back and the leg muscles.
I do deep massage.
She's also a vice president.
So that's a brief glimpse
into a corporate culture
that has industry leaders
and management analysts
scratching their heads, wondering
what Sunset Farms will try next.
But it may be as simple as the
Winklers' chief competitor said.
You've got something people want,
everything else falls into place.
Or as we in TV might say,
there's no accounting
for the public's taste.
Keep coming through with the stuff.
I think it's better the way
I had it. Put the doll there.
Mrs Winkler?
You wanted to check the menu?
Right. Stevens,
bring that piece downstairs
and try it again
next to the fireplace.
I want a lot of nuts and crudites.
What did we say for openers?
Yeah, snails.
Escargot, yes,
then potato and truffle salad.
By all means,
but I hate those thin pieces.
When you shave it,
lay it on big time.
Truffles are always shaved
finely, Mrs Winkler.
I wouldn't suggest anything overdone.
..then poached
sea bass in filo,
and spinach souffle
and salad and dessert.
And finger bowls.
Nothing being served reQuires them.
You never know
whose fingers need washing.
- Did you rearrange this again?
- Hold your water!
Every time I come home it's like
walking into a strange house.
Did I tell you to get rid of this?
It's a harp. You got no flair, Ray.
Nobody plays the harp. Who plays it?
What's it doing in the living room?
I like the visual sweep.
You know, I don't know
what's gotten into you,
you're so hoity-toity
all of a sudden.
My cookies pay for this,
so turn it off.
What's for dinner?
And don't tell me it's little
sparrows on a bed of lettuce,
cos I never want anything
on lettuce again.
They're pheasants and you ate 'em.
And I almost choked on a BB!
Can I get a cheeseburger,
is that possible?
Are you forgetting?
It's the dinner party.
Oh...great
Just when I got a lot on my mind.
Your mind don't hold a lot.
Come on, get dressed. It's tuxedo.
- I'm hungry.
- You want a snail?.
A...? Are you nuts?
I'm gonna have a snail?.
Come on, you eat steamers.
Hey, a snail leaves a trail
of scum in the yard when it walks.
Not in France, they don't.
Jesus, what happened to all the
turkey meatballs and spaghetti?
Have a potato and truffle thing,
that'll hold you.
Truffles got no flavour, Frenchy!
They're subtle,
only pigs can find 'em.
You're thinking of pearls,
they come in oysters.
- Take a hike.
- You're such an ignoramus.
That's what I love about you,
you're... Pearls are in oysters.
Ray, Ray, Ray...please.
- Don't spoil my big night.
- What's so big about tonight?
There's a lot of important
arts people coming.
Hey, we donate,
you'll be on the boards.
- I wanna be a patron.
- You wanna be a socialite.
So what? Is that so terrible?
But when we talked about
making it, we were gonna hit it big,
move to Florida,
swim, eat stone crabs...
We can get a place in Palm Beach.
Palm Beach is ritzy.
I want to go to Miami,
be at the dog track every day.
I just wanna be as far away from
Frenchy Fox the topless wonder
as I can be.
Hey, you were beautiful
as Frenchy Fox.
You'd come out, remember
you'd give it a little of this?
Those days are over.
And our accountants want us
to be twice as big next year.
What good is that
if I can't get a cheeseburger?
Ray, please, be charming tonight.
I've seen you when you wanna
turn on the charm, you sparkle.
All right.
I gotta go.
Good evening! Welcome to
our humble little abode.
Charles Bailey,
this is my wife, Emily.
- How you doin'?
- David Parret.
- Hello, hello.
- Linda Rhinelander.
- Can I get you drinks?
- Just Evian, or Perrier?
- Certainly.
- We got anything you want.
I take tap water. The fluoride
keeps your teeth from rotting.
Hey! Look at this!
Hello!
So glad you could attend
our humble abode.
We just got back.
Didn't want to miss the new Traviata.
- Have you seen it?
- No, not yet.
Nor have I. What is it?
Ray, why are we standing
in the hallway?
Please, let's retire
to the living room.
Are you a fan
of the ballet, Mrs Winkler?
I used to be a dancer, but,
please, call me Fren...Frances.
- Frances Fox-Winkler.
- The Foxes from Saratoga?
I don't know,
I never checked my pedigree.
Can we change the music? I feel like
I should be wearing a wig.
You will be soon.
Did you do the place yourself?
They say I have a flair
for decorating.
- This rug lights up.
- It lights?
Yeah, it's made of fibre-optics.
I'll turn it on later.
Stevens,
what's with the snails?!
W-w-why don't I get the door
and you show them your
collection of leather pigs?
- Do you play the harp, Frances?
- No, it's a visual, honey.
The sweep kills me.
Oh, finally. Girls...
Hey, how you doin'? Come on in.
Right there, all the action...
Hey, honey? Toots?
Shake it, they're in there.
- How you doin'?
- Garth Steinway.
- Garth Steinway.
- Garth...? Yeah.
- I'm Anthony Gwynne.
- Oh, no kidding?
You're the outfielder
with the Padres?
Our goal is to raise $2 million,
then the company
can tour the west coast
and include the new opera.
Right.
Well, count me in.
I love serious music.
Ray, on the other hand,
opera freaks him.
Have you tried your finger bowl?.?
So the guy says,
"What do you do for a living?"
He says, "I'm a monback."
He says, "What's a monback?"
"You know, I stand behind
a truck saying "'monback"!"
H-he stands behind the truck,
he goes "'monback"!
He says... I think
it's too fast for her.
'Monback. He says 'monback.
I do think they overpaid
for the Picasso.
I mean, for me it was unusually
mediocre, don't you think?
I agree completely. Excuse me,
I have to go find my wife.
I saw a beautiful painting of
fruit at the Met or the Whitney,
it might have been the Holocaust.
Are you affiliated
with any of the museums?
No, I'm a private dealer.
We have one or two paintings but
I haven't gotten around to...
- building a collection.
- Uh-huh.
So what are you interested in?
Er, Rembrandt, Picasso, Michelangelo.
- You know, the boys.
- Yeah, yeah.
I might be out of Michelangelos
at the moment.
But I have come into possession
of an incredible Damon Dexter
that someone's trying to sell,
is he...?
I'm not aware of him.
No, well, he's new, you know.
I have to say, your wine
is absolutely delicious. Really.
The chef who did the finger
bowls chose it. Have you rinsed?
David used to own a vineyard,
so he's a tough audience.
Did you study art at school?.
No, I didn't. I think I should have.
No, I studied literature.
Then inevitably
wound up as a stockbroker,
then I dropped out,
went to Japan and became a Buddhist
blah blah blah,
and then I did teach art for a bit.
And then the vineyard.
My God, what a life,
and you're still so young!
Don't be fooled.
Somewhere in a closet
there's a portrait of me ageing.
In the closet?
Why would it be...?
Oh! How droll.
You hear about the Polish carpool?.
Every day they meet at work.
I can't believe this room.
This takes bad taste to new heights.
This is excruciating.
And can you believe them?
I can't keep a straight face.
And this apartment,
the flawless vulgarity.
She must've been
frightened by a leopard.
I think they plan
on being very generous.
And the house?
Not to mention her clothes.
This is
the definition of bad taste.
I never saw so much jewellery.
It makes me sad that I don't
have to steal any more. Really.
What's the matter, honey?
You've been Quiet all night.
What's bothering you?
What's bothering me
is that we got no class.
Speak for yourself,
I was very charming tonight.
Ray, I went to sit in the bar.
They were in there talking about us.
You shoulda heard 'em.
And they were right.
We got more dough than all of them.
It ain't dough.
It's knowing the finer things.
Like what? Opera?
Like food and wine
and painting and books.
Stop it, will you? I'm unimpressed.
All my life I've been ignorant,
I could never afford to learn.
And I was a good student...
Well, I was a lousy student
and I always hated school.
If I could find
my school principal today,
I'd put a contract out on her.
Class is something
you can't fake and can't buy.
I got more class
in my little finger than them.
We came into a few bucks
but we're phoneys,
we're trying to act like big shots.
- Not me.
- Well, me.
But the time has come to use our
dough to amount to something.
Like what?
To change our lives.
I'm too busy to change my life.
Doing what? Playing pinball?.
I don't wanna wear a tux any more,
I wanna go to Florida and swim.
Well, I wanna be the real thing.
Wise up, because if I grow and
you stay as stupid as you are,
we're gonna have
big problems, Ray.
Smarten you up,
is that what you said?
Yeah, you said you were a teacher,
you know art, opera,
books, wine, you know,
we want to learn it all,
don't we, Ray?
I'm flattered you think
I'm capable of...
Turning two slugs like us
into classy items?
No homework. I never did any
when I was young, I'm not...
You know, not doing
anything that's got homework.
Naturally, we'd make it
worth your while, David.
No, it's absolutely
not about money,
it's just that...I've never been
asked to do anything like this.
I'm not sure
I'd know where to start.
I know I gotta get
a better vocabulary.
Have you ever thought about
enrolling in college?
I didn't go to high school,
why would I go to college?
That takes four years, we want
a private crash course, right?
Am I crazy? She's nuts!
David, tell her she's nuts.
What are... I'm gonna
learn about life suddenly?
I must say, Frenchy,
Ray has a point, you know.
He could probably teach me more
about life than I could teach you.
What's he gonna teach you?
I can figure the point spread
and count cards at blackjack.
- Close your bazoo.
- I can...
Close your bazoo!
I don't want to be discouraging
because what you propose
is admirable...
I'd like to be able
to spell Connecticut.
Don't ask why, I never knew
how to spell Connecticut.
Fair enough.
You could teach him that, right?
Yeah.
You said this is
a slow period in the art market
and we would take
VER Y good care of you, right?
Like I say, I don't want
to discourage you...
I'd just have to think about it
a bit, I haven't...
If I could envisage a plan,
a starting point.
We could start by, you know,
building our art collection.
You'd make a few bucks
and we can learn something.
But I'm not going to museums.
The...pictures spook me out...
-
- Virgins...
- What are you laughin' at?
- Spooked by the virgins!
- I'm sorry.
- Work on the laugh.
You can see the difference
between this Tintoretto
and the earlier Byzantine
painting we looked at.
What would you say is the
most significant difference?
I would say that
the frame's bigger here.
Mm-hm. Yeah, it is bigger,
but there's also a difference
in the paintings themselves
and it's important
because it characterises
the great technical leap
from the ancient
into the modern world.
You remember how the saints
had very flat faces
and the background was on the
same plane as the foreground?
- Perspective.
- Right, perspective.
Let me show you another
very good example of that.
"The frame on this one is bigger"?
Oh, boy, you are a dummy.
Hey, don't give me "perspective."
Take a hike, will ya?
28.
- Four.
- Lev axle.
- You niv dee can.
- 87.
-
- 90.
- Darvo sed.
- Four.
- Red do.
- 10.
I'm hungry.
Learn something.
There's nothing to learn!
This is where Henry James lived.
- Who?
- The band leader, stupid.
- Married to Betty Grable?
- Yes!
No, you're thinking of
Harry James, who's brilliant too.
This is Henry James, the author.
- Oh.
- Yeah?
This is where he lived
and worked and...
I don't care where he lived,
where did he eat?
- The Heiress, right?
- The "H" is silent.
Oh. Did he write that too?
Oh... Frenchy!
Frenchy, I'm still sick.
I'm weak, I can't go.
You're gonna miss an interesting
"great books" discussion.
Yeah, I know. It kills me.
But I... I'm just gonna lay here.
See you when you come back.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Ray's got a cold.
- I bet 500.
- 500?
See your five, raise you 500.
I'm out.
I'll see the five, and a thou.
What did you think of the book?
Well, I thought
it was very romantic.
I mean, he loved her but their
backgrounds were so different.
Right.
So you thought
it was doomed from the start?
I guess, cos he wound up dead,
but I think that two people
from different backgrounds
can make it if, er...
the juice is there.
Right.
- Sorry, juice is...is?
- You know, the hots.
Right.
Wine, would you like some wine?
I brought over a bottle
of Chateau Margaux.
We can compare that
to my Clos de la Roche
and see the difference between
a Bordeaux and a burgundy.
I've got two others
of the same vintage
that I thought
it might be fun to try.
I see the five, I raise a thou.
I'll see it,
raise you a thousand more.
And a thousand.
- And a thousand.
- OK. Call.
Read it and weep,
a pair of threes.
Oh, good,
I thought you were bluffing.
So what do you wanna play now?
What about Indian Poker?
Seven cards, hold them over
your head, nobody sees their hand,
we bet on each other's hands,
high-low, wild cards all the reds.
Do you wanna sit down, May?
Old Maid?
Can you play Old Maid?
So, um...try this one.
Well, OK.
Nice nose.
Yeah, the bouQuet is very special.
No, I mean you got a nice nose.
- Me?
- Yeah.
I can't describe it,
it's like kind of...
- It's just any old nose...
- AQuiline.
Yeah, um, talking of which, how
is your vocabulary coming along?
Oh, good. I'm almost through all
the "A" words in the dictionary.
Right, right.
Thing is, I'm not convinced
that memorising the dictionary
is the best way
to improve your vocabulary.
- Hmm.
- Yeah.
You sold the Damon Dexter so
fast and at such a good price.
That'll really
take a bite out of our debts.
Oliver, it's dawning on me
that the opportunity has arisen
for me to become Quite,
er, obscenely rich.
They're serious
about an art collection?
- No, that would be peanuts.
- What, then?
Well, I think that she
might be falling for me.
Frenchy Winkler?
How much do you think
she's worth, roughly?
- Her husband, you mean?
- No, it's all in her name.
What are you saying?
I don't know, I suppose I'm saying...
people grow and marriages
sadly break up and...
women remarry, you know?
Fortunes, they change hands.
What is this?
It's a Damon Dexter,
a discovery of David's.
I say it's depressing.
You wouldn't know a masterpiece
if it bit you.
- I refuse to look at this.
- What does that mean?
It means I won't look at that wall.
Oh! You're a head case.
I bet David made a profit on this.
Whose cookies pay the rent, huh?
He's making a fool out of you!
Stevens, what time is it?
I no longer look at this wall.
- 11am, sir.
- Thank you very much.
David, what's this? Oh...
Oh, that?
That's a citrine necklace.
- You know about citrines?
- No.
They're not precious stones,
but the lustre's very special.
And that?
Ah...
- Talking about lustre...
- Uh-huh.
This is very special
and very, very expensive.
It's a cigarette case that
belonged to the Duke of Windsor.
I know the Duke of Windsor!
He also married
beneath his station, right?
He did, he did,
like our friend Henry Higgins.
It was such a romantic story,
I saw it on television.
Uh-huh?
Ray? Ray!
What are you doin' here?
I'm...having Chinese food.
That's what they serve
in a Chinese restaurant.
- You want some company?
- Who?
Who's talking to you? Me!
All right...but where's Frenchy?
She's at a concert,
some piano concert with a guy.
Oh. They have take-out here
but they won't deliver to a concert.
Don't worry about it, May.
Rachmaninoff:
Prelude in B Minor, Opus 32
Dinner was so great, May.
All that MSG and the grease,
it was just... What a treat.
I'm so sick of continental food
every night.
You know,
Frenchy eats frogs' legs.
Do they taste like chicken?
Rabbit.
- Rabbit tastes like frog legs?
- No... Forget it, forget it.
Are you happy being rich?
It's OK.
I got a lot of charge accounts
and a really, really
nice apartment and a maid.
- I'm still lonely though.
- Yeah? How come?
The guy I was seeing left me
because he was so embarrassed
about being poor
and hated that I paid
for everything.
So I stopped paying,
and that's when he left me.
Yeah, I can...understand your...
- You...you enjoy being rich?
- I hate it.
- You're kidding?
- No, I hate the life, you know?
- It's making me lose Frenchy.
- What?
I mean she's outgrowing me,
that's what she said.
She's a different person.
I think she's got a crush
on her teacher, David.
Yeah, well, he's very
good looking and really bright,
- very charming and elegant...
- OK, I got the picture.
You really know
how to make a guy feel good.
- When you're right, you're right.
- Thank you.
What did
you think of it?
I thought the whole evening
was apocalyptic.
- Apocalyptic?
- Totally. I really was agog.
Well, me too, she's fabulous.
And I have to asseverate
she deserves accolades.
Have you been
memorising the dictionary?
Yeah. Next week the "B"s.
How do I look?
I have to say,
that dress is just...gorgeous.
See? Your influence. Low-key, right?
Well, that's very flattering...
Ray thinks it's dullsville.
David?
- Paige.
- Wasn't Rachmaninoff inspired?
Wasn't it?
I thought it might incur
my animadversion
- but realised it was apposite.
- A-ha! I think I see drinks.
- Good to see you, David.
- Nice meeting you.
I love your friends, David.
They're so bright and cultured
and refined, it's another world.
It's a world I know
you'd love to belong to.
This looks a lot more civilised.
- Oh, beautiful.
- Let's take a seat here.
'Anything we get,
Cody's in for his full share.
'That's how it is.'
You know why
I respect Cody?
- Why?
- Because he loves his mother.
I understand that, May.
Even though he's a cold-blooded
killer and she encourages him,
still, it's sweet.
Yeah, I wish
I had a mother like that.
- More Pepsi?
- Yeah, please.
And this is the best part,
I love this part.
Yeah...
Will you pass me the Crackerjack?
What are you lookin' at?
I happen to be noticin' you,
I was lookin' at you
a couple of times tonight,
cos for the first time
I had the thought
that in a very, very strange way,
you got a sweet face.
It's off-beat
in a kind of bizarre...you know.
I don't know how to explain it
exactly, but it's...
it's right up there.
- What d'you mean?
- It's a compliment, May,
I'm trying to say a nice thing.
Cos you being a relative of Frenchy
I never before classified you
as a human-type female.
- So...
- I-I-I was married.
A long time ago, right?
It was a really tragic story
because my husband, Otto,
was dyslexic, and the only thing
he could spell was his name.
That is... That's, er...
There's no doubt about it,
burgundy really goes to my head.
What did you want to talk about?
I've, um...
Well, I've...got
a little present for you.
- For me?
- Yeah.
- Here.
- Oh...pretty...
I love leather books.
Oh, Pygmalion.
I love that story, David.
There's a little inscription.
"To my favourite Eliza,
"from your Professor Higgins,
love David."
- I got a confession to make.
- What?
I got you a present too.
Oh, no, you didn't have to do that.
It's in appreciation of all the
stuff you've been doing for me.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, Frenchy...
- This is...
- Frances!
Frances, this is...
It must have cost you a fortune.
What good's having dough
unless you spend it, huh?
This is...this is so extravagant...
I-I'm embarrassed.
Don't take up smoking,
but if it's good enough for
the Duke of Windsor, right?
Well, I'm really overwhelmed
and my little Bernard Shaw
is so insignificant...
No.
But you see I just...
I just wanted you to know how
unbelievably proud I am of you.
David, this is not insignificant.
Maybe I'm talking
out of turn here but...
you've just
developed so much and I...
I just feel that you belong
in a world of society
and high culture now.
It's frustrating because
you should continue growing,
you should be branching out.
There's Paris and Rome and the
great opera houses and museums.
You should be able to cultivate
the right kinds of friends...
Anyway, I, you know... Biff.
It's hard,
cos Ray's not like that.
He likes watching TV
in his underwear, suckin' a Bud.
Well, I don't know what to say.
I can't...can't comment on that.
- Can I be frank, David?
- Mm-hm.
Sometimes
I think I've outgrown him.
- Pretty late.
- You too. What did you do?
Ah, you know,
I-I, uh, worked late
and then May and me
had some Chinese food.
You and May.
What did you talk about? Cartoons?
No, we went up to her apartment
and watched "White Heat" on TV.
- Till 3am?
- Then we went and got a pizza.
Chinese food and a pizza?
I'm surprised you didn't break
into the Pepto-Bismol factory.
No, Frenchy, for the first time
in a long time I had fun.
- I wanna talk to you, Ray.
- Now?
David's going to Europe for a month,
I thought we might go along,
see some sights.
- What kind of sights?
- Churches, opera houses, ruins.
What are you, a stroke victim?
Fly 3,000 miles
to see opera houses and ruins?
Well, I wanna go.
- What do you mean?
- It's part of my development.
You're Frenchy Fox from
New Jersey, stop putting on airs.
David thinks it would be good for me.
- I get a bad vibe about him.
- You think everybody's a crook.
I wish I still was a crook,
I'd feel like a person.
You haven't grown along with me.
The only thing that's grown
about you is your rear end.
I'm sorry, Ray,
I wanna go to Europe.
We're married! You can't
just go to Europe with David.
- I asked you to come!
- Cos you knew I'd say no!
My idea of fun is
not going to operas and ruins.
I get enough sleep at home.
I never thought I'd say this,
but maybe the time has come
to re-evaluate our marriage.
If you go with David, you'll
have to re-evaluate it big time.
I won't be held back by an
over-aged juvenile delinQuent!
Then get yourself a lawyer.
We don't need lawyers, I'll go 50\50,
even though it's all in my name.
You're right,
we don't need lawyers
because I don't want anything.
You can have the house, the business,
custody of all the
chocolate chips, I just want out.
You know, May, it was on a
boat that I proposed to Frenchy.
Yeah, yeah, I know.
Suddenly I'm not her type
after all these years.
Oh, may I tell you something, Ray?
What?
You're not my type either.
What? What the hell does that mean?
Maybe Frenchy wasn't so wrong
to try and make something
out of herself.
Frenchy overdid everything.
Well, you underdo everything.
There's more to life
than turkey meatballs.
I don't know. I get a bad vibe
about this guy David.
It's my street instinct,
but I don't trust him.
Because he's younger than you,
he's handsomer than you,
he's much taller than you are,
he's smarter than you,
he's much more exciting than you.
May, don't pull any punches
with me, I can take it.
Women... You know, women like
a little elegance. It's more...
So if I did it again I would
do some things differently.
Maybe I'd sit through
more operas with Frenchy.
Especially now they got
the new Sony Walkmans.
Now you split with Frenchy,
you don't even work.
No, I don't work,
but I got an idea for something
and I want to talk to you about it.
Really?
Wow, what a place.
That's the home of
Chi Chi Potter, the socialite.
Now, Chi Chi's got a necklace,
it's all emeralds
with diamonds around it,
it's a very famous necklace,
maybe you saw it in a magazine.
Would it have been on TV?
I don't know, but it's been
in magazines, it's famous.
I wanna... I could live off
that necklace, if I fenced it,
for the rest of my life.
Remember what happened
with the tunnel.
Yeah, but we don't
have to tunnel any more.
Now, Frenchy and I,
we're patrons of the arts
so Chi Chi invited us to a big party,
Frenchy's out of town, you come
with me, we get the necklace.
Oh. I never heisted anything before.
There's nothing to it, I know where
the safe is, I've been planning.
'I had dinner there one night
and I excused myself,
'I was very crafty.
'I went upstairs
and I scoped it all out
'and found the safe and I got
the whole layout in my mind,
'so I know we can do this.'
I don't wanna wind up in jail,
and if this is such a big item
they'll be turning the town
upside-down looking for it.
No, I have
a particularly shrewd mentality,
I got a connection in Chinatown.
I bring in
a picture of the necklace,
he makes me an exact duplicate,
I switch, she never knows.
She's a... Chi Chi's a dumb,
flighty society dame.
By the time she figures out
there's been a switch,
I'll be in Florida
or the Cayman Islands.
Hello? What?
- I can't hear you, what?
- Shh.
I'm in a crypt! I can't!
What do you mean?
What are you talking about? How?
Give me a break, sister, OK?
- Today?!
- Shh!
What do you mean
it's an emergency? I...
- Oh, hi.
- Mrs Winkler?
We're sorry to bring
you back from your vacation.
- What's goin' on?
- I've terrible news.
- Something happened to Ray?
- Sunset Enterprises is bankrupt.
- How?
- Fraud.
- Fraud? Who?
- Your accountants.
I-I-I don't even know
who they are. What?
- You should have looked.
- We let them handle everything.
What do I know
about running a corporation?
Did you ever read
anything you signed?
No, but they assured us
everything was OK.
Mrs Winkler, do you want a drink?
I'd like a 1961 Romanee
Saint-Vivant if we have it.
I'd have a whisky if I were you.
Well, I don't understand,
I mean, Sunset's gone?
Can't we do anything?
We could put a few people
in jail IF we could find them.
Oh...this is the worst news.
Oh, no. No, Mrs Winkler, it's not.
No? It is to me!
No, no, the worst news is coming up.
Oh. All right.
All right, you better tell me.
Let me sit down.
They talked about expanding Sunset.
That's right, yeah.
To do that you needed a bank
loan, are you aware of that?
Quite a substantial loan.
Get to the point.
You signed a promissory note
to the bank.
This is exactly what
I've got accountants for.
Yes, but your accountants
are in Venezuela.
Wh... This is all so confusing!
You put up your home and savings
for a monster loan.
Could you put some cyanide in here?
- It needs to be stronger.
- You've lost it all, Frenchy.
Or should I say you've been
swindled out of it all?.
- You mean I got...
- Nothing. You have nothing.
No house, no bank account,
just some large, outstanding loans
which we feel you can best deal
with by filing for bankruptcy.
Bankruptcy? Bankruptcy?
I'm not up to the "B" words yet.
- Sorry.
- Does Ray know about this?
What difference
does it make to Ray? He's gone.
What did you say?
I'm bankrupt.
Sunset's gone. Worse,
all my personal dough is gone.
The whole ride's over.
Well...
How could that possibly happen?
Fraud. My accountants.
Ray said not to trust them because
the whole firm had moustaches.
I-I'm gonna get myself
a little Valium.
David, I can't give you
that loan I promised you.
What? What did you say?
It turns out I got people I owe.
But you did say
I could borrow $400,000.
I was using it to cement a deal!
It kills me to cop out on you
like this, but I'm busted.
- What an idiot.
- I guess I am, yeah.
H-how could you be
so stupid and irresponsible
as to allow some patently
cheap and thieving accountants
to defraud you out of a future?
How could anyone be that stupid?
Aren't you a little out of line?
I've made plans,
I've made commitments to people!
Oh.
You got a strange look in your
eye, like the guy from the book.
Dr Jekyll or Mr Hyde or
Ted Bundy, I can never remember.
The time I've put in nurturing
an idea that's not gonna happen.
Is that what it was? The money?
I-I need my prescription,
my little blue pills
so I'm gonna...go and get them.
And I would very much appreciate it
if when I came back you were gone.
Thank you.
David, I'd like the cigarette
case back that I gave you.
I don't think so.
Wow.
I asked you for lessons in life.
I guess I really got one, right?
Oh, we're so glad you could come!
- How are you?
- Good.
Langston wants to talk to you
about a theatre project in Aspen.
- Do you ski?
- Me? No, never.
Do either of you play miniature golf?
- There's Minky.
- Hello.
Oh, for heaven's sake! Er... Mingle.
I don't think you should speak.
- You said make conversation...
- I know.
Make conversation but don't speak.
You know,
don't bring up anything.
Maybe the weather,
but don't...don't...
I'm gonna get in the flow
and then kinda glide upstairs.
- Shall I glide with you?
- No, I'll contact you.
- Can I get you some champagne?
- Uh...sure.
Ray!
I was gonna make a phone call.
- Have you seen Edgar?
- Edgar?
Where that man gets off to!
I was gonna make a phone call...
- I'll look downstairs.
- Try back there.
Thank you, Ray.
Oh, Winkler? Do you play golf?
Golf? No. I was just
gonna make a phone call...
Guess I was mis...misdirected.
Yes, I'll just go and use the phone.
I wanted a match on Sunday
but I'll get somebody else.
So sorry.
There'll be rain over
the tri-state area, and fog.
Temperatures will hover
in the low 60s till Tuesday.
I must say,
you are most amusing.
Would you like a canape?
Those are shrimp,
these are Quail eggs, and...
I don't have
any idea what they are.
Thank you,
I hate things with toothpicks,
they lodge in your throat.
I'm George Blint,
Mutual Funds, and you?
May Sloane, I'm a lookout.
I noticed the way
you walked and carried yourself
from across the room.
You remind me
of my wonderful departed wife.
You can't carry yourself
across the room,
that's physically impossible.
You're charming.
You're the first woman
I've met since Helen died
that I could say that about.
Was Helen your wife
or just a woman who died?
Where's Mr Winkler?
I wanted to talk to him.
Oh, he's mingling.
Cloudy today, wasn't it?
With a chance of light sprinkles
followed by sunshine.
Absolutely. Chi Chi, would you
get those photos in the bedroom?
I want to show Mr Winkler
the property in Aspen.
Yes, I just want to talk
to Dr Henske.
He'd be perfect
to do Beth Kramer's face
after the unbelievable job
he did on Mrs Morton's buttocks.
Oh, I'm going to be right back.
Would you just...?
Ray...
Shh! You scared me.
- For God's sake.
- I came to warn you,
Mrs Potter's coming
to get some pictures
that Mr Potter wants you to see.
She's looking for you.
Now I've closed the safe.
It's a tough safe,
I'm out of practice.
- Did they see you come up here?
- Uh, I don't think so.
Get out there
and stand watch.
I'm gonna do this again.
Are you OK?
I'm fine, I'm fine.
Get out, get out!
If you could fit it in to
your schedule, it would mean so much.
She's been so down since the divorce
and don't you think -
he got custody of the Pola-Polas.
Chi Chi, don't forget those
photographs for Mr Winkler.
Oh, I'll get them.
So, you will try?
- I'll do my best.
- Kiss kiss.
Mrs Potter is coming!
She's gone.
- Shh!
-
She's gone.
Mr Winkler wouldn't go without
saying goodbye, would he?
He's not upstairs.
Jesus.
I met a wonderful man downstairs.
He seemed to like me.
He said I reminded him
of his wife who's dead,
but I assume he meant
when she was alive.
May, can you stop talking
while I'm doing this?
Little short fella, bright
yellow shirt, unbelievable tie.
Oh, yes, I know the gentleman,
he was going upstairs before.
- Are you sure?
- Er, yes, um... Mr Winkler.
Ray, I hear something.
- Oh.
- Ooh!
She's not feeling well.
She had one of her spells.
- Spells?
- Yes, she gets spells.
- We have a doctor...
- No, not necessary.
I-I-I'm a haemophiliac.
- Dear God, are you bleeding?
- Why would I be bleeding?
Oh, no, she... Her neck...
There is, but my nasal passages
are clearing up.
On weekends
I do this for a hobby.
- She had champagne, you know...
- Oh, I'll get Dr Henske.
Really... Ray, you have
my cortisone pills?
- Me?
- My medication?
I'll feel better
if Dr Henske looks at her.
You relax and I'll go get Dr Henske.
A haemophiliac? Cortisone?
Where do you get this?
- On TV.
- I said stay with the weather!
I thought I did
some Quick thinking!
Yes, and you're going
to be examined now!
Why? I just had a check-up.
Jesus, I got no time to work here.
They'll be back in seconds.
I can't tell the difference
between these!
Then you gotta take 'em both.
I can't, if they
don't find any necklace...
we've been suspiciously seen
in here, I'll go right to jail!
Especially with your DNA!
What has my DNA got to do with it?
You better choose,
they're gonna be back any minute.
I ca... I ca...
Ray, let's go!
Oh... Grrr!
All I know
is what I've told you, Doctor.
She's right in here. Come along.
Here's Dr Henske!
What seems to be the trouble?
False alarm, it was a hot flash.
I think it was menopausal,
I've seen it before.
I-I'm given to occasional spells.
- Spells?
- Not spells, but she...
No, no! Sometimes for no reason
I get hot and cold flashes
and the room will spin
and spots will flash before my eyes
and I'll hear
a ringing in my ears...
You're making
too much of it, May.
..and then my tongue turns black
and I can't swallow.
Really?
They diagnosed Parkinson's
but it could be Ebola
or mad cow disease...
We got to go...
It was a false positive, I think.
Come on, sweetheart, we're due.
I do hope you feel better,
and not to worry, Mr Winkler,
Aspen will have to wait.
Ebola virus or mad cow?
I just said the first thing
that came into my mouth.
- Great.
- Hello, again.
George. Do I still remind you
of your wife?
You kill me, you're great.
You're not feeling well,
remember? I'm taking her home.
I'm in the book, May Sloane.
I'll be better.
Well, I'll call you.
Ray, I just got the news
about Frenchy.
Frenchy?
Didn't you hear? Sunset's gone under.
She was defrauded out of every penny.
- I figured you'd know.
- Yeah. No, I do know. I...I...
Shit.
I came as soon as I heard.
I got exactly what I deserved.
You know, I missed you, Frenchy.
I'm sorry I blew our cookie company
but I'm even more sorry
I blew our marriage.
What are you gonna do?
Everybody makes mistakes.
The important thing is
I still love you.
I don't deserve it, I behaved badly.
You behaved like an ass.
That's one of those "A" words
you used to practise. Ass.
But I'm not the easiest guy in
the world. I'm not Mr Sensitive.
There's things
I coulda done differently.
We stayed in separate rooms the
whole trip, Ray, that's the truth.
So where's David now?
He split the second I went bust.
No, I don't believe it
He was hustling me for the dough.
Jeez. So now we got to
begin again, you know?
And in more ways than one.
You still want me?
Still want you?
You got to ask a Question like that?
I'm crazy about you.
You're a goddess to me.
I'm nuts for you.
Of course I want ya.
But we're broke,
we haven't got a dime.
We don't own a stick
of this furniture.
Can I show you something?
May I show you one thing?
- OK...
- Just let me...
I think you're gonna be
very, very proud of me.
That's Chi Chi Potter's!
Was... Was Chi Chi... Was!
- Ray!
- Key word, "was".
- You didn't?!
- I never felt so great.
I was back in action, I felt alive.
- Cos I always felt...
- Hey, this is glass.
What are you talking about?
How's it glass?
- It's fake.
- What? How would you know?
I can tell fake,
this ain't even good fake.
What are you talking about?
Oh, you know, it might fool some
idiot with no eye and no brains
but it'd never pass
with a normal person.
You're saying I got the phoney?
I came away with the wrong thing?
Sounds like your MO.
- Nuts! I was in the room...
- Yeah.
I was gonna substitute the
glass one for the real one...
It's good to see that you got
the same great instincts.
You're so wrong...
Can I tell you...?
- What?
- You take those lessons...
Wait, I'm gonna show you something.
..but you know nothing
about jewellery.
This is... We take this
and fence it, go to Florida...
It's the goods.
That won't get us on the subway,
much less to Florida.
You're such a know-everything.
You don't have to be
a rocket scientist
to spot a clinker like this.
Whoever made it, you overpaid.
What can I do if you're wrong?
Tell me.
Can I take your nose
and twist it till you turn blue?
Sure.
Gee... You broke it.
It's glass, Ray.
I know, but... Wh... Eh...
It's, well...
I'm not cleaning it up!
You broke it!
You got glass over everything!
It's dangerous, you...
Jesus... I don't know what you
see in me, I'm such a screw-up.
- It's glass!
- Ray...
All that matters
is that we have each other.
We didn't there for a while
and it made me realise
how much I need you.
But you're married
to a loser, Frenchy.
No, I'm the luckiest woman
in the world.
And the brokest.
We got nothing.
As usual, I come up empty.
We could pawn this.
What is this? What is this thing?
Who...?
I don't understand,
who's the Duke of Windsor?
We could probably auction it.
- Where'd you get this?
- From David.
David gave you this?
He doesn't know it yet.
I don't get it, what do you mean?
Hey, it was you who taught me
how to open a safe.
I... That was one of my fondest
memories of our time together.
What are you saying?
You boosted this from David's safe?
- Frenchy, that's stealing.
- Not exactly.
It's a long story, Ray.
Let's sell it.
I'll fill you in
on the flight to Miami.
Sweetheart, you...
are the greatest.
Oh, baby,
what I couldn't do
With plenty of money
and you, ooh
In spite of the worry
that money brings
Just a little filthy lucre
buys a lot of things
And I could take you
to places you'd like to go
But outside of that
I've no use for dough
It's the root of all evil
Of strife and upheaval
But I'm certain, honey
That life could be sunny
