My good brother.
That"s it? No suitcase?
Let"s just get out of here.
Don"t smoke in the car.
- Afternoon, Miss Graves. Welcome.
- Hello.
- Hi.
- Nice to see you.
- Shall I take your coat?
- No, thanks. L"m not staying.
Brad, Dex, sorry I can"t stay for lunch.
I have a board meeting in Detroit.
This won"t take long.
Nothing for me.
No, maybe l"II have a Diet Coke.
Make that Evian water, please.
l"II have San Pellegrino water. No ice.
Here"s the deal. There"s no deal.
- My client balked.
- What do you mean?
- She thinks her company"s worth more.
- She thinks or you think?
On second thought, that looks interesting.
- Just tell us what you want and don"t say...
- Smoked chicken?
l"ve got to make a phone call.
It"s just us here. What are you looking for?
l"m looking for a world of fair play...
...where corporate big guys
don"t always get their way.
Still beating up on your ex-husband?
You"re gonna pay for that one.
Who"s her husband?
Me and my big mouth.
Pookie!
Don"t call me Pookie.
Sorry. I just meant to be affectionate.
What"s the matter?
Nothing. I'm just in a meeting
and I don't have a lot of time.
Remember when you said you wanted
to have sex with me in a weird place?
How about Detroit?
Too kinky. Anyway, they"re installing
my big screen on Sunday...
...and I have the Mile High Mall
presentation in Denver next week.
- What will I do by myself in Detroit?
- Buy a Chevy. Prove you"re American.
I don"t love you, and I won"t miss you.
Call me when you get there.
"Bye.
Mr. Sorenson and Mr. Diggs.
Go right in. Enjoy the party.
Thank you very much.
It will be taken care of.
It"s my pleasure.
What happened, Boss?
Did they go for it? They"re crazy not to.
What do these Colombians want?
It"s foolproof!
We got all the customs agents,
the border guards. Everything"s in place!
We"ve got a little problem.
A cloud over us.
The cartel"s made an offer of $50 million.
It will be on the table for 30 days
if we can make this little problem go away.
Jarmin. They know about Jarmin, right?
It"s time to finish it.
We"ve got to find him and take him out.
Easier said than done.
We"II do it ourselves this time.
Make sure it gets done right.
Lovely day.
But we have a little cloud to blow away.
Closing down, Billy Ray.
Nobody driving
in this bad weather tonight.
Why don"t you give up on that tank,
come on over to the house for dinner?
It"s no good you being alone so much.
Been in town three months,
you haven"t made one friend.
At least none that l"ve seen.
Why don"t you wash up,
come and meet the missus tonight?
Hear me?
l"m gonna turn down this radio.
You gone to sleep under there?
God! Help me, Marvin!
Help me! Pull me out!
Get me out of here!
- Hold on!
- Help me.
Get me out!
Goddamn it!
Get this off of me!
What am I gonna do with no legs?
Look at you!
Something wrong with your brain?
l"m sorry. I gotta do something
to break up the monotony around here.
You"re bored?
l"m bored as hell. Don"t take it personal.
l"m just a restless guy.
That"s the kind of guy I am.
That"s why I travel around so much.
I get it from my daddy. He"s a traveling
salesman. Sold hairbrushes in Kentucky.
Thought you said your dad raised hogs
in Tennessee.
He raised hogs and he sold hairbrushes.
You"II bullshit at the drop of a hat.
You can"t say you never pulled
anybody"s leg before.
l"II get it.
Thank you for that dinner invitation.
- May I help you, ma"am?
- Unleaded, please.
- Hey, is that WJB on the radio?
- I have no idea.
Yep, that"s what it is. That"s a "60s station.
I listen to that one all day.
You know what they say about the "60s,
don"t you?
If you can remember them,
you wasn"t there.
- Want me to check under the hood?
- No. It"s rented.
You come to Detroit
and you rent a Beemer?
That"s like going to Germany
and eating Jimmy Dean sausages.
In Tennessee, where I was born,
I never saw cars like this.
I was 22 before
I knew foreigners made cars.
Are you from Tennessee?
- Yes, ma"am, l"m a Southern boy.
- What"s your name?
Billy Ray.
Named after both the scoundrels my mama
thought might have been my daddy.
Is that cash or card, ma"am?
Rick?
Beg your pardon?
- Will MasterCard do?
- Just fine.
- You remind me of someone a lot.
- I do?
Yeah, a boy. A man.
Named Rick Jarmin.
His plane went down in Mexico.
Fifteen years ago.
- I never went to Mexico, but...
- You laugh like him.
- I didn"t mean to.
- You look like him.
I don"t know what to tell you.
Want to sign that?
You have a nice day.
- Billy Ray?
- Ma"am?
Do you have a tattoo?
Tattoo? No.
Your upper right arm. A dove.
I don"t have a tattoo.
l"m not leaving till you show me.
I hope nobody"s looking. There. Satisfied?
Right arm.
I got some shrapnel in Vietnam.
It"s down my side. Want to see it?
l"m sorry. My friend
would have never been in that war.
Meaning what?
He was very much against killing.
I'd like to help you, sir,
but Offiicer Baird is retired.
That"s not possible!
He wouldn"t retire without telling me.
He"s been handling my case
for the last 15 years.
Give me your current name and ID, and
l"II connect you with your new case officer.
With all due respect,
I don't know who the hell you are.
If I give you my name and number,
you"II know everything.
- Hold, please.
- No, hang on. Damn it! Hello?
Excuse me.
That call you've been waiting for?
He's on the line.
He won't give me his current name
or location. He wants Lou Baird.
Rick? How you doing?
This is Joe Weyburn. Remember me?
I set you up at that photo lab in Cleveland.
Was it 1978? No, 1979.
I don"t remember you.
You know us FBI guys all look alike.
You are one rolling stone, aren"t you?
Where are you now, Rick?
Where"s Lou? He would have told me
he was retiring.
- Why didn't he do that?
- To tell you the truth, he lost you.
- He lost me?
- Yeah.
That's why we put him out to pasture,
why I'm on the case.
Where is he? Where did he retire to?
Where did he retire to?
He once gave me a number.
His sister"s place in St. Louis.
He used to go there on vacations.
Is that where he is? Am I getting warm?
He"s out of the picture.
Are you in some kind of trouble?
Not at all. Where"s Sorenson?
Still safely in jail as far as I know.
Nothing to worry about.
He"s never getting out!
His partner?
- Diggs?
- Yeah.
Unless he"s made another pass at you...
...he"s probably got his drug money
living the good life in South America.
- We have no idea where he is.
- That"s a relief.
So what is it...
...relocation time?
I guess. Where can you put me?
Where are you now?
And what name are you using?
Come on, I'm just trying to do my job.
Bowers, Billy Ray.
I live above Marvin"s Motown Motors.
Did you get that? I'm not repeating it.
Somebody recognized me.
I want to get out before they come back.
Right.
Two days.
Two days?
Hang on and we"II have somebody
come in and get you.
Okay, l"II be hanging.
The drop in foreign sales...
...reflects both the negative effect
of the strengthening dollar...
...and an upsurge in competitive
production in Europe and Asia.
Add this to the recent surcharge
imposed by the EEC nations...
...it's clear that to preserve the profiit
our shareholders expect...
...we have to make cuts
to our production costs.
While it is true our rising costs...
...will be defrayed by the acquisition of
Coleman Shipping, we should be clear...
You"re freaking me out!
All those opposed?
If Miss Graves will respond?
- Miss Graves!
- Yes.
No.
You are abstaining from the final vote?
Yes. No, I am not.
I see.
She says to me, "'Marvin,
you"re not getting any younger.
"'Think about that young man working
for you, and offer him a partnership."'
- We don"t have no sons.
- You ain"t known me but three months.
How do you know you can trust me
to stick around or not steal from you?
I got my eyes on you.
The hand is quicker than the eye.
l"m going upstairs and get some sleep.
See you in the morning.
Think about that partnership.
- L"II see you in the morning.
- That mean it"s a deal?
I sure will think about it.
Good night.
Pumps are closed.
Pumps are closed.
She won"t be humming again till 6:30 a.m.
You Billy Ray Bowers?
Y"all from Weyburn"s office?
Y"all got an interesting accent.
Shit.
You always were an actor,
weren"t you, Rick?
- You pretended to be my friend.
- I never did.
- Then you turned on me.
- I never agreed to help you kill.
Still a do-gooder?
My friend, Mr. Diggs, is worried about that.
l"ve served my time, thanks to you,
but he"s still under indictment.
Seeing as you"re the only living witness
that can put him behind bars...
What"s he got on you? You still his flunky?
Are you some hero?
Hiding in a grease pit for 15 years?
I don"t think they"II put up
any monuments for you.
Any last words?
What"s going on?
Get out of here! Run for your damn life!
Watch out!
Help!
- Let me in!
- Rick, is that you?
Yeah, it"s me! Let me in!
- How do I know it"s you?
- It"s me, Muffy. Open the damn door!
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Me? What the hell are you doing here?
Being shot in the butt.
- She saw you.
- I saw her, too.
I appreciate this.
l"II have to borrow your phone if it"s okay.
Ice. I need plenty of ice.
l"II get the ice. You go to the room.
It"s the presidential suite.
- Okay if I use your phone?
- L"II be there in a minute.
- Miss Graves?
- Mr. Takawaki!
Do little party?
Yes. A party for girls.
Maybe next time?
Maybe.
I don"t care if they"ve left for the day.
l"ve got to get through to them.
...555-7000.
Yes. The presidential suite.
Operator? God!
- Rick?
- What?
Are you all right?
l"ve been shot in the butt.
Can you believe it?
- Can I come in?
- L"m naked. Can you handle it?
I handled it for a lot of years.
I guess I can handle it now.
It"s my lower back and my butt.
I think the pellet passed through...
Vietnam?
Hell, no. I took the dove off with a sander.
I really am anxious to hear this story.
I need some bandages,
antibiotic and some antiseptic.
Get shot often?
Only twice before.
Could you please help me?
Could you look at my butt?
You leave me at the altar.
That was my state of mind at the time.
You went off with Jamie
to seek your fortune...
...and you were coming back to marry me.
Am I remembering this correctly?
If not, correct me.
You get lost in your plane.
Reported missing, presumed dead.
I attend your memorial service,
and cried the tears of a grieving widow.
I vow l"II never get over you.
In fact, I never do.
I still carry your damn pictures
in my wallet!
Until one day, I pull into a gas station...
...and you"re alive with people chasing you
and you ask me to look at your butt?
That"s kind of neat.
Rick"s alive and he"s shot in the butt.
Guess who"s alive and shot in the butt?
Rick! L"m looking at his butt now!
You lying...
...gutless...
...son of a...
...yellow snodbugger, toad, bellybutton...
I can"t think of enough awful things
to say about you, you bastard!
I guess that"s a no on examining my butt.
- L"II get it. It"s probably for me.
- You can"t answer my phone.
Hello?
Yes. Fine. Taking a shower.
l"m coming home tomorrow.
Okay. "Bye.
Same guy?
- What guy?
- Harper. Jeremy III.
Rich boy, redneck asshole.
The one you married.
- You remember him?
- You know I got married?
Yeah. Four months after I disappeared.
That"s pretty quick work
for a grieving widow.
Where were you?
- You could have waited to find out.
- I was Ionely.
You were Ionely
so you married the joke of the campus!
Jerry the Napalm King.
How could you do that?
We had it wrong.
His family made laundry detergent.
- Cornwall Chemicals?
- No. Kitchen cleanser.
Don"t kid yourself.
They were getting rich off the war.
The war? Was that it?
You were dodging the draft?
Or were you too gutless to tell me
you didn"t want to marry me?
Are you all right?
Yeah. I just feel a little woozy.
- I better call the doctor.
- No doctors.
Four Seasons Hotel.
Is this the front desk?
Is there a pharmacy?
Yes, certainly.
Please send up gauze pads,
tape and hydrogen peroxide.
- Right away, Miss Graves.
- Thank you.
All right. What"s going on?
Was that a holdup
or is someone chasing you?
Got any kids?
It"s just you"ve got that "'Mom"' tone.
l"m a lawyer. I have that lawyer tone.
I can help you.
Will you talk to me?
Tomorrow.
l"II talk to you tomorrow.
Good Lord.
Rick Jarmin"s alive.
- How"s it going?
- Any idea who did this?
Maybe. I got a phone tip from
an eyewitness, said there was shooting...
...and a blue Beemer racing away
with a man and woman in it.
- We"II see what happens.
- Sarge, better take a look at this.
See you later.
Here.
Thanks a lot.
I have a right to be rude.
I left a message for him.
I waited for it and...
He picked it up. What time was that?
I want to go above his head.
Try it by name. Try Bowers.
- Billy Ray Bowers.
- No one by that name on our list.
- No record of a Billy Ray Bowers?
- No, sir.
- Try Jean-Pierre Fouret.
- No, sir.
- Turnbull, Jodie.
- No.
- Carlson, Matthew.
- No, sir.
Try Jarmin, Richard.
Rick Jarmin.
See if anybody by that name exists.
l"m sorry, sir. Have a nice day.
Something"s gone wrong.
I don"t seem to exist anymore.
Expecting someone?
I have a standing order for breakfast
at 7:00 a.m.
- What time is it?
- 6:48.
You got a gun?
Of course you don"t have a gun.
- You got any kind of weapon?
- No. It"s my breakfast.
Marianne, get dressed.
Get dressed fast, please.
Yeah, we can make it.
What do you mean "'we"'?
l"m not going out there!
Four attempts have been made on my life.
If you open that door,
you could end up dead.
Listen to me. We are at the top
of a veritable fortress.
Yes! Presidents, oil sheiks stay here.
Friends of Lee lacocca stay here.
George Harrison stays here.
Yes! Because it has the best security
money can buy. Don"t be paranoid.
I hate to be an old woman,
but paranoid keeps me alive.
This guy comes every morning. Trust me.
- Got your breakfast, Miss Graves.
- What did you order?
- What did you order?
- I ordered...
...grapefruit, croissant...
And what?
Prunes.
Ask him what he"s got.
- Go on, ask him. Bet he can"t tell you.
- What"s for breakfast?
Some kind of breads and fruits.
l"II be right there.
Rick, pull up a chair, sit down.
l"II share my prunes
and then you can tell me all about this.
Don"t take the chain off the door.
Rattle it like you"II take it off.
Make him think you"II take it off.
You mean like this? Is that good?
Yeah. It"s funny to you.
Oh, God!
- Get the mace!
- You get it!
The mace! The mace!
Hurry up!
- Come on! Upstairs!
- Wait a minute! Get my purse.
- Hurry up!
- I can"t do this, Rick.
What are you talking about?
This is what Lee lacocca does.
l"m very scared, Rick.
Since when did you start
wearing underpants?
Do I get to know what"s going on
or do I get killed for old time"s sake?
Follow me.
- L"ve got to know what"s going on.
- So do I.
l"m supposedly being protected
by the federal government...
...but I think they"re trying to do me in.
- Who are those men?
- Ex drug-enforcement agents.
I sent one to jail and could send the other.
They want me and whoever"s with me.
- Why?
- I testified against them. That"s why.
- About what?
- It"s a long story.
This is not a good time to talk about this.
Help!
My God!
Is that the VIP entrance?
Good morning. How are we doing today?
l"m so hungry!
We got to get out of this room.
- It"s too dangerous to go to the room.
- L"ve gotta change my clothes.
No! We"II buy some, okay?
If this isn"t a dream, l"m in deep shit.
- You owe me an explanation.
- Get me out, l"II tell you everything.
No. Don"t tell me.
No keys.
Gotcha!
- I ought to weenie-whip you!
- Get that weenie out of my face!
Let"s get outta here.
- How you doing over there?
- Great.
Tell me the story.
Remember when Jamie and I
got everybody to chip in...
...so we could go south
and score some real Acapulco gold?
I remember you borrowed his father"s
plane so you could fly to Mexicali.
That"s the last I ever heard from you.
It seemed simple.
Fly south, pick up a couple of keys.
But no, we were really impressed
with ourselves.
We started drinking,
shooting off at the mouth...
...and before we knew it there was this guy
called Sorenson involved.
- Things just got a whole lot bigger.
- What a dumb-ass thing to do.
- You always did love being a big shot.
- You don"t understand.
I understand. You were being
a couple of jerks like always.
Anything for a kick.
Anything to thumb your nose at authority.
Your gold card.
Where do you get off with that attitude?
"'Rick Jarmin, asshole."'
- Whatever happened to you?
- I got smart.
Is that what you call being corrupted?
"'Smart?"'
- You know nothing about me.
- I got your number, baby.
We got a blue Beemer.
You"re totally unchanged. L"ve never met
anybody more holier-than-thou.
Tell me something honestly.
Do you ever donate anything to the poor?
Or do you and Jerry the Napalm King
hoard your millions?
- Laundry detergent!
- Yeah, we had it wrong.
Yes. We"re very rich
and we hoard our millions.
Occasionally we invite a poor person in
for Thanksgiving.
Feed him nothing. We eat turkey
in front of him and watch him starve.
- Can I drop you somewhere?
- Yeah. Wisconsin.
- Wisconsin?
- Yeah. Racine, Wisconsin.
l"ve got to find Lou Baird. He"s the one
I can trust to get me back into hiding.
- What"s he doing in Wisconsin?
- He"s not. He"s in St. Louis.
l"m with Rick Jarmin again.
The hand is quicker than the eye.
My address book is in Wisconsin.
His sister is there,
and I think that"s where he retired.
I don"t think you"re
in any witness-relocation program.
You"re some two-bit criminal
being chased by the police.
- You don"t mean that.
- Or you can"t pay your gambling debts.
- You dressed it up with this FBI crap.
- Wisconsin is only six hours away.
- I have a life.
- But are you happy?
- L"m expected home.
- Hands on the dashboard. Don"t move.
- Get that gun out of my face.
- You have the right to an attorney.
I am an attorney, damn it!
- Are you Billy Ray Bowers?
- What"s he charged with?
You"re both charged
with the killing of Marvin Marsent.
You were identified
at the scene of the crime.
Rick, tell them.
- What?
- About the witness relocation program.
- You"II have time to tell us in jail.
- Put both hands behind your head.
Drive!
Get in the car!
Shut up and steer the damn thing!
- Did you kill the guy?
- No, I loved him. They killed him.
Then you can plead innocent!
I never will. They"II kill me before
I get a chance. The same goes for you.
Get your foot off!
Shit! Oh, God!
You"re gonna break my legs!
Stop squealing!
Watch where you"re going.
Go north as soon as you can.
Get your face off my gas!
Shit!
This can"t be good for you.
- What are you doing?
- L"m taking your place. Move over.
This is a rented car.
We can get in trouble if you drive it.
- You"re worried about Hertz? Move!
- Give me my wheel!
You"II get us both killed.
Move over!
Jesus!
- I think we lost them.
- Where are we?
They"re not there anymore.
- We"re in the railway tunnel.
- Where the hell are we?
Shit!
Back up!
I don"t know. Stuck.
Goddamn!
What are you doing?
You almost got us killed!
I did you a favor.
Are you having fun or something?
I can"t believe when you pulled...
You were great back there.
I was so scared!
You"II love it in Racine.
It"s a happening town.
The car was rented by Marianne Graves,
a lawyer from New York.
How she got involved, I don"t know,
but I don"t like it.
Call it kidnapping.
He"II kill her the same way
he killed his boss at the gas station.
I don't like all this killing.
Erasing a witness...
You"re not trying to back out on us,
are you?
Not a good idea, Joe.
Please don"t smoke.
We would hate to inform authorities
that 20 years ago you were responsible...
...for selling confiscated narcotics out
of the back door of the police warehouse.
Yeah, Joe. Especially now
that you"ve got yourself such a big career.
Relax.
l"m doing everything I can. L"ve used
the kidnapping to bring the FBI in.
We"re plugged into the woman"s
phone lines, credit cards, bank account.
Auto club. They're bound to surface.
When they do, Jarmin will either be shot
or wind up in prison. Then he"s yours.
We"re looking forward to that, Joe.
What a pro.
Hundreds! That"s all you carry.
Where are we now?
Shortcut.
What"s the matter?
Nothing.
I never told you, Jamie"s dead.
God!
He was killed by Sorenson and Diggs.
They were two drug enforcement agents,
corrupt ones.
They busted Jamie and me
for the nickel bags we bought...
...and told us we'd rot injail
if we didn't do exactly what they said.
One minute we were kids...
...and the next we were trapped
in the middle of a major drug deal.
They needed our plane.
They made us fly under the radar
to an unmarked airstrip on the US side...
...and that's where all hell broke loose.
Diggs and Sorenson must've been
under government surveillance...
...'cause there were a lot of cops
waiting for us when we landed.
Sorenson came out shooting.
He killed one of the border patrol guys.
He wounded another one.
Diggs, however, got away.
Me and Jamie fiigured
we could bring Sorenson down...
...before he killed anybody else.
We were wrong.
Jamie got it point blank in the chest.
I spent three months in a Mexicali jail...
...before the FBI
fiinally offered me immunity...
...for testifying against
Diggs and Sorenson.
That"s when I joined
the Witness Relocation Program.
It"s been fun ever since.
Why didn"t you call me?
I didn"t want to get you involved.
You were about to march up
to the altar anyway, so I let it lie.
This is it?
I think this is it. It"s all changed around.
Yeah, this is it.
It better be here or l"m in deep shit.
l"m going to look for a bathroom.
Have any change
so I can get to the VA hospital?
Hold up.
- Be right with you, pal.
- What do you need?
- What"ve you got?
- What are you doing?
That"s all you"ve got.
Here, brother.
- Have three squares on me.
- This all you"ve got?
- How dare you do a thing like that!
- The guy"s hungry.
That"s for me to decide! That"s my money!
- You"ve got plenty. What"s the problem?
- I worked hard for it, damn it!
You couldn"t carry something smaller?
Why do you carry hundreds? Status?
No! Emergency.
- This was an emergency.
- But it wasn"t my emergency.
It"s that attitude that keeps half the people
in this world starving.
I don"t see you feeding the poor!
What did you just see?
You"re such a jackass!
Am I?
Mattie?
Mattie Carlson? My God!
- Mattie?
- L"ve got to talk to you.
When I left my job here,
I owed this guy a lot of money.
Hi.
You won"t believe who"s here!
It"s Mad Mattie Carlson!
- Can you wait in the car? Could get ugly.
- Don"t tell me.
I must talk to you.
You were a hairdresser?
You don"t get a lot of choice
in the relocation game.
I can"t believe it!
Raun is gonna shit! He"s gonna die!
I can"t believe it!
Can"t say hi to an old friend?
Cat got your tongue?
Say something!
Hi, Scotty.
Hiya, babe.
I can"t believe you came back!
- How are you?
- Great.
I like the...
That? It"s just dirty. I had to tie it up.
- Gorgeous.
- Who"s this?
This is my sister.
Hi. Come on. Let"s go see Raun.
- He"s dying to see you!
- L"II bet he is.
Your brother is a genius! Michelangelo
of hair. L"m not exaggerating!
We lost half our clientele when he left.
He left on his lunch break.
Can you believe it?
Bread and butter!
- Silly girl.
- He always does my hair.
Are you coming back?
You"II have to pay Raun what you owe him.
- Raun, look who"s back.
- Hi, Raun.
Hello, Matthew.
l"II bet you"re surprised to see me.
You"ve lost weight. Your hair!
You look 10 years younger!
Cut the crap. You"ve been a bad boy.
I know. Mea culpa.
And sic semper tyrannis.
You"re so right. But l"ve come
to pay you back what I owe you.
Will wonders never cease?
- You still have my things, my address...
- Show me cash, l"II show you the book.
Could you hang on a minute?
- This is funny to you?
- Yes.
I need $2,000 cash.
Isn"t it nice one of us
became a materialistic being?
- Can you help me, please?
- What"s in it for me?
If I get the book, I can get to Lou Baird
and pay you back quicker.
If I don"t get the book,
you might be stuck with me.
How"s that?
Who do I make the check out to?
l"m supposed to believe
your check is good? I want cash!
- The bank"s over there.
- L"II get the book?
We"II discuss it when I see cash.
And then l"II want an apology.
Then you can do my hair.
- Why mess with pertection?
- Rick, it"s only fair!
- Who is this?
- His sister.
- She called him Rick.
- I called him sick.
He is sick!
Cash. Apology. Hair.
In that order. L"II be waiting.
Driver"s license and three IDs.
Credit cards do?
Break.
Where"d he go?
- Stall them.
- L"m not stalling them.
Sir?
- What"s going on? Can you step on it?
- Certainly.
Right.
Take what you want.
- What are you doing?
- L"m going as fast as I can.
- Here.
- You"ve got the wrong idea.
Freeze!
Don"t move!
Put your arms up.
Down on the floor!
- My credit cards!
- Forget about the credit cards!
Just let me get my gold card.
Please? Just let me...
Stay down or the girl gets it!
- My purse!
- Come here!
- What"s going on?
- Step across the street, please.
Sure.
l"m not going with you!
You"ve got no choice. They"re after you,
too, and it"s not just the cops.
What am I supposed to do?
Spend my life running like you?
Well, it"s up to you.
We"re dead if they catch us.
Now hop aboard or say good-bye.
Come on.
So long, tough guy.
So long.
What are you doing?
This is the car. Lieberman?
Cover the rear. Take McCurrin with you.
Check out everything.
Yes, sir, I got it.
- Cover all the stores.
- Right.
- Get this towed out of here.
- Yes, sir.
Cover all the stores.
What the hell am I doing?
Hop on!
- What are you doing here?
- I missed you.
- You okay?
- Why are we going back?
I forgot something.
Raun wants to play!
- What is this? Butch on wheels?
- Here"s your cash. Give me the book.
It"s more than you need.
Give me the book!
Take me with you!
- This town needs you.
- Cut the crap. Let"s get out of here.
That ought to be enough
to cover the damages.
What damages?
Shit.
Hang on.
Look out!
I have the suspect in sight
and I am in pursuit.
Hang on.
Get out of the way!
I'm following suspect. I am in pursuit.
Watch out!
I almost have them. I am in pursuit.
What are you doing
with your face in my sidewalk?
I am no longer in pursuit.
- Can you step on it? I'm in a hurry.
- I'm going as quickly as I can!
Everybody freeze! Nobody move!
Don't move. Put your hands up.
On the floor now!
Looks like she"s there of her own free will.
Look at this part.
Will you come here?
She tried to go back for the money
when her boyfriend wanted out.
He"s not her boyfriend. Can we
get that straight? I am her boyfriend.
She"s not a kidnap victim, so the FBI
is out of it. It"s up to local authorities.
Hi, Joe. This is Paul Bernhardt.
Joe Weyburn. He works here.
Any theories as to how to head them off?
He obviously used to work at this mall.
Maybe going back to a place
of employment is a pattern.
Without a record of previous employment,
we can only wait and see.
Keep on it.
Mr. Bernhardt.
"'Matthew Carlson, Raun"s of Racine."'
"'Jodie Turnbull, Muncie Farms."'
Yeah!
Tell him Rick Jarmin
needs to speak to him.
I need to. It"s urgent, okay?
Jarmin. J-A-R-M-l-N.
Not till when?
Okay, thanks for...
Yeah. He"II remember me.
Believe me, he"II remember me.
Thanks again.
"Bye, ma"am.
Hallelujah!
He"s there. Not till 6:00, but he"s there.
He had to go to the doctor. Demon out!
He"s got a job in the zoo.
He got me a job there once.
Did I tell you about
when I worked at the zoo...
I don"t wish to hear about the zoo.
I wish to get out of these bushes.
l"m wearing cashmere in 100º heat.
I don"t feel like waiting till 6:00.
- Well...
- Yeah?
I know someplace we can go.
It"s on the way.
If you don"t mind riding for a couple hours.
- Think you can do that?
- Yeah.
- What are you saying?
- Nothing.
Either say it or don"t say it, all right?
Rise and shine.
- I need a night"s sleep.
- Ace!
Come here.
You son of a bitch. You"re still alive.
Hopefully she"II get better
when she"s had the operation.
Jodie?
Rach. How are ya?
- I never thought l"d see you again.
- I guess you"re surprised to see me.
- You look great.
- Talk about dropping out of the blue.
This guy built half this place
and disappeared.
l"m sorry, this is Marianne Graves.
- This is Dr. Rachel Varney.
- Hello.
- You used to work here?
- Yeah.
I was a carpenter and a general...
Pilot, designer, everything.
And then just one day, gone.
l"m sorry about that.
I had to leave in a hurry.
A man was looking for you after you left.
He"s still looking for me.
- What happened?
- Shot me in the butt.
Quite a game of tag you two play.
Let me see.
It"s just a little buckshot.
It went straight through.
Not if it"s bleeding. Let me take a look.
Take your pants down.
Not out here.
What are you, shy? L"ve seen it before.
l"m sorry. Are you his wife?
Are you kidding? No way.
You two just go ahead and whatever.
l"II call a cab.
That"s not a good idea.
She"s insane with fatigue.
She needs something to eat,
a bed and a bath.
l"m sorry.
You can use the guest house
to wash up and sleep.
- Jodie, can you stay the night?
- I don"t know.
Go ahead, Rick. Be a sport.
- She always calls me Rick.
- I won"t get in your way.
- It"s not like that, really.
- Yes, it is.
- It was.
- It was.
He picked me up, put me back on my feet.
Showed me how to do everything.
- I bet he did.
- You should see the barn.
It all worked.
Every single idea you had worked.
- The big animal practice is back there.
- Takes one to know one.
- The horse sling"s wondertul. Want to see?
- Yeah. Let"s go.
- You never saw anything work.
- I never knew it would.
- It did.
- Marianne, come on.
l"m sure she doesn"t want to bother.
She"s exhausted.
l"d like to see that horse sling.
"'Heigh-ho, Silver!"' Look at that.
Isn"t that wild? They thought it was nuts
when I showed them the plans.
I thought it was nuts when I did them.
Come see this.
- It works great.
- It works.
- Nice job.
- L"m a genius.
We"II let the inventor use his table.
Drop "em and hop up.
- Do you need her to leave?
- L"II stay.
l"ve seen it before, too.
Great. You can assist.
Get the peroxide and sponges
from the cabinets over there.
Come on. Take your pants off
and get on the table.
- Come on. Don"t be a baby.
- Be gentle with me, okay?
l"II think about it.
l"II be gentle.
That"s cold.
The cows never seem to mind.
- Roll over.
- Roll over.
Do I get a Milkbone?
What did you have in mind?
Let"s take a look.
- How is it?
- Not bad, but it"s not great. Clean it up.
- What"s that?
- I don"t know.
Sulfuric acid.
What are you doin"?
I hate those things.
- You okay?
- Fine.
- Feel that?
- Feel what?
- There it is.
- What?
Sponge.
- I think you need a little fresh air.
- No, l"m fine.
l"II send your cowboy right out.
Maybe just a whiff will help me.
She"s tired,
and she needs something to eat, too.
So, who is she?
- She"s just an old friend.
- Yeah, right.
- Really. An old friend.
- Are you sure about that?
When you got a knife up my ass, I am.
How bad is it,
this "'thing"' you"re running from?
Pretty bad.
Think you"d ever beat it
and want to come back here someday?
If I could beat it, l"d go anywhere.
l"m asking because
l"m engaged to be married.
"'Flagellations."' That"s great.
l"d rethink it...
...if I thought you might
come back this way someday.
You always were direct, Rachel.
- You"re done.
- Thanks.
How long have I got?
The wedding"s on Sunday.
l"m a bad bet, you know.
Much happiness. Come here.
Excuse me for a minute.
You never hustled like that
when I was angry.
Are you okay?
- Forget it.
- Forget what?
I need a phone to get out of here
so you two can live happily ever after.
It"s not like that. She was...
In your arms and you were naked. I saw it.
- It"s nothing.
- And my name is Dumbo. Who cares?
What"s it to you? Why should you care?
- You"re happily married, yeah?
- L"m not.
- You"re not happy?
- Not married.
- No?
- It just didn"t work out.
He was a prick.
You"re better off without him.
My heart can"t take this again.
Remember the time I saw
that flying saucer?
We were smoking
some pretty heavy stuff back then.
I think I see another one.
What"s that?
Friends of yours?
- Go! L"II stay here.
- Right.
Let"s get out of here!
- "Bye, Rach. Thanks a lot.
- L"II cover you.
Let"s fly.
l"m gonna kill you!
- Hurry up, Rick!
- Ready for this?
Tie down your toupee.
- Can"t this thing go any faster?
- This is as fast as it goes!
Hang on!
Oh, my God!
l"m gonna throw up!
l"m not kidding!
- Are you crazy? What are you doing?
- I gotta take his rotor out.
- What the hell?
- What"s he doing?
Slow down! He"s cutting up the rotor!
We"re goin" down!
If you"ve got a belt, put it on.
And stick your head between your knees.
- What do I do now?
- Kiss your ass good-bye.
We got no wheels and we"re comin" down.
I don"t want to die!
Are we dead?
No.
But we will be if we don"t get out of here.
This can"t be good for you.
Help me.
Hang on.
Let"s go. This thing still might blow up.
It"s been five years.
I haven"t lost my touch.
It"s like riding a bicycle.
You never forget it.
I can"t take this anymore.
l"m gonna go on the road and hitchhike.
I don"t care if they catch us and we die.
I need food. I need a bath.
I need a bed.
I need a massage.
I need a manicure.
I need to see my therapist.
I need a beer. Look at that.
It"s the promised land.
We have no money and no credit cards.
l"II talk to the guy in charge.
Give him this.
- Give him my watch.
- Hold me down.
If they don"t take that, sell my body.
I don"t care.
l"II try and get there
early afternoon tomorrow.
Thank you. "Bye.
Right here. Hallway.
See you in the morning.
Tomorrow at 7:30, before you know it.
- Thanks, Norman.
- Good night.
Hiya, pooch.
- Marianne, are you in this one?
- There"s no lock and no door handle.
Watch the door. It falls of the hinges.
Why didn"t you choose another one?
The guy said, "'Take your pick."'
- The only one with a TV.
- So there is. Civilization.
I wonder if we"re on the news.
Shit!
There was nothing good on anyway.
l"ve just taken a shower.
l"m wearing a towel.
l"m hanging up my clothes.
This is interesting narration.
l"d appreciate your not watching me.
There"s nothing else to watch.
Speaking of watches, l"ve still got yours.
I didn"t give it to the guy.
We"II need it tomorrow anyway.
We"II have to get a car or something.
Lou Baird said he wants to see me
in person.
I was talking to his sister.
I tried to tell her the problem.
But she said it wasn"t a good idea
to discuss it on the phone.
- Why?
- I don"t know.
- Was the phone tapped or something?
- God.
I knew you"d say that. I hope not.
Don"t go there. Call the police.
You know I can"t do that.
Why are you so paranoid about the police?
They can help you.
l"m half a day"s drive away
from Lou Baird"s. L"m not going...
How do you know
he"s not part of the setup?
Because he isn"t.
He"s saved my hide too many times
to want to kill me now.
Tomorrow morning,
we"II find the nearest town...
...swap your watch for some old junker,
and everything will be just fine.
I know what l"m doing.
Have you got a towel?
That"s not a towel.
- Who"s gonna pay for this hotel room?
- They need a chambermaid.
- A chambermaid?
- L"II help you.
It"s only 12 units.
It won"t take us very long.
- Are you mumbling? What are you doing?
- Good luck.
- L"m out of here in the morning.
- I gave this guy my word.
I didn"t, all right?
l"II call my office in the morning...
...have them express mail some money,
pay the guy off.
l"II buy this goddamn place,
if necessary, and l"m out of here.
- Calm down. What"s eating you?
- Calm down?
I just took a shower with a cockroach
from hell. He"s doing his hair now.
Not to mention that you"ve sold me
into human bondage.
- You really are spoiled.
- Yes, I am.
Then being a chambermaid
might do you some good.
God!
- Stop that shit.
- What shit?
That mumbling
has always driven me crazy.
Did you ever wonder why we got together
in the first place?
Do we ever agree on anything?
Did your personality ever not annoy me?
- Sex.
- Sex.
- I really don"t remember.
- You really don"t?
I don"t think you do either.
I think this is a cheap trick
"cause l"m getting into bed with you.
- I wouldn"t worry about me.
- Anyway, I have a boyfriend.
A very wondertul boyfriend.
- Who"s this boyfriend?
- How"d I know you"d ask me that?
- Why shouldn"t I?
- You"II just belittle him.
- I would not.
- You will. I know you.
Have it your way.
- Please stay above the covers.
- Why?
My towel is wet. I have to get out of it.
I guess so.
That"s better.
Thank you.
Tell me about this boyfriend.
What"s he like in the sack?
Can he thrill the lake?
l"m not discussing sex with you tonight.
I haven"t had a girlfriend in five years.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Mr. Wiggly"s been on bread and water
for five long years.
- Is that the truth?
- Yeah.
I didn"t think it would be fair.
You cold?
Not really.
Feels familiar, doesn"t it?
Thought you said you didn"t remember.
I feel kind of selfish under here.
You are very selfish,
and not just under there.
- Too bad you said that.
- Why?
I was actually beginning to get turned on.
- Too bad for you. I wasn"t.
- You weren"t?
- No.
- Fine.
Stop that, will you? If you do that again...
You can"t tell me what to do, okay?
I can"t help it.
What are you gonna do,
add another felony to your list of crimes?
Go to sleep.
I can"t. What"s the name of this boyfriend?
Tell me. L"II be nice.
You will? Okay. His name is Paul.
Sounds like a dipshit. Anyone named Paul
is probably a spot welder.
Shut up. Go to sleep.
- Is that true?
- What?
About five years?
- Thought you didn"t want to discuss it.
- I don"t.
- Then shut up.
- Shut up?
Yeah, l"II shut up.
God.
Let me look at you.
I missed you.
God, I missed you.
Doesn"t this feel right?
I had that dream again.
Remember the dream I used to have
after we made love?
The one about the Seven Dwarts?
Remember the dream,
we were in the middle of the ocean...
...and it was that really big sailboat?
- Yeah.
- We were alone.
There was nobody around. It was just us.
- That"s a nice dream.
- Can"t we do that?
Can"t we find a way?
l"ve spent 15 years looking for it.
If I could"ve found it,
l"d have come and got you, married or not.
- Would you really?
- Yeah.
But there"s nothing we can do now.
We gotta get out of here.
l"m gonna see what kind of car
I can get with that watch of yours.
There must be a way.
Yeah?
Paul? Marianne. No, l"m fine.
l"m really all right.
I can"t talk. L"m fine.
I just need you to help us.
I need you to call someone. Please.
Yes, damn it!
- I don"t have enough time.
- Marianne, your chariot awaits you.
- Just do it! I gotta go.
- Where are you hiding?
Better pick it up, hot legs. We gotta go.
- Hi.
- You found me.
Wait till you see what I got for you.
- Bring it on out here.
- There"s your watch.
- What a beauty.
- You think so?
Fine piece of equipment.
Look at this little jewel here.
I had to grind him down,
but he finally accepted my terms.
Hello. Extension 2200, please.
Hello?
Yes, Mr. Bernhardt.
Of course I remember you.
They"re headed where?
She wants federal marshals
and some members of the press there.
You did the right thing by calling me.
I can take care of all that.
No, you wait by the phone.
We"II make sure she"s safe.
You don"t have to worry.
You bet. Thank you.
All right. End of the line.
Jesus, we"re overheating.
We"re lucky to get here at all.
Hang on. Wait for me.
The lights are on, so I guess
there must be somebody in there.
Lou.
- It"s me, Rick.
- In a minute.
Stubborn old guy, isn"t he?
You mind if we come in?
l"II see you at the front door.
- Lou.
- Yes?
It"s me, Rick Jarmin.
My Lord. So it is.
Jeez, Lou.
Come on in. Hi.
- This is Marianne Graves.
- How do you do?
You scared the hell out of me.
I thought you forgot who I was.
I damn near did.
l"d be in big trouble then,
"cause l"m in a spot...
...and you"re about the only guy
in the world who can help me out.
Where do I start?
They finally let Sorenson out of the cage.
He and Diggs are after us, and they seem
to know every move we"re making.
I think somebody at the Bureau
is doing us in.
I work at the zoo.
- L"ve got connections there.
- You placed me there, remember?
It"s just down the block.
I can find it every time, even in the dark.
Molly likes it that way.
Are you Monty?
l"m sorry. I didn"t hear the bell.
Are you the young man who was calling?
I told you I didn"t think he"d remember.
That"s why I thought
you should come here.
Sometimes it helps if he sees a face.
Ma"am, do you know who that is?
Those are federal marshals. I called them.
I thought this was a setup.
Even if it isn"t a setup,
you have to talk to them.
You can"t keep running...
You"re right about one thing.
There"s nowhere else to run.
- You have a basement here?
- It"s off the kitchen.
- Can you show it to me?
- What have I done? L"m sorry.
It"s designed as a bomb shelter.
No one can get in here.
Go and lock yourselves in.
Don"t come out till it"s quiet.
- Where are you going, Rick?
- I don"t know, Lou.
How about the zoo? They got guns there.
- You know every inch of the way.
- That"s a good idea.
Zoo.
Hello?
Hurry up!
You got nothing to fear. Joe Weyburn.
- Aren"t those guys gonna follow us?
- Damn well better.
They"ve changed the code.
Not now!
- How did you...?
- I can"t believe I did that.
- Come on.
- Wait.
You didn"t see us, Bob, okay?
That"s gotta be them.
Be careful.
Stationery.
Where is it?
Where do they put these things?
- They used to have real guns here.
- What"s that?
That"s a tranquilizer gun.
l"m sorry.
l"m sorry I did this to you.
I called them on you.
That"s all right.
I should be apologizing to you.
It"s probably for the best.
- Fifteen years is long enough.
- Yeah, it is.
Lock the doors and stay in here
no matter what you see.
Don"t come out. Just stay in here.
If you see me do this,
I want you to hit this button.
See what it does?
See those lights there? It turns them on.
Just like that, okay?
Keep your head down.
Please live through this.
I can"t go to another one of your funerals.
You remember, you stay in here.
"Cause it"s a zoo out there.
Which one did he say?
Rick? It"s Joe Weyburn.
We don"t mean you any harm.
We just want to talk.
Welcome to the tropical rain forest.
We have assembled a collection
of flora and fauna...
...indigenous to both the South American
rain forest and the African Savannah.
There.
Shit!
Think I got him!
Gotta stop this thing somehow.
Go get that girl!
Yeah!
Wake up! All of ya! Get up!
Rise and shine! Get up!
Come on, fellas. Give me a hand.
Shut up! Get back.
Shut up!
Shit.
Excuse me.
Surprise!
Come on. Hands behind your head.
Fingers clenched.
Now!
What is that shit? Get over there!
Spread them!
I got him! I got Jarmin!
What do you need him for?
Why don"t you...
No, buddy, this is his kill.
Means a lot to him.
My head.
I got your lady here.
Come out, or l"II throw her to the tigers.
You"re wrong, Rick,
if you think I won"t do it!
Don"t you even want to watch?
l"d hate for you to miss this.
Fifteen years!
Fifteen years l"ve waited for this!
It"s me.
It"s me. Take my hand.
Please!
I can"t hold on.
Yes, you can. Come on, honey.
You can do it.
Just pull me towards you.
l"m sorry I can"t get you out of this.
Me, too. Listen.
l"m free now. I could marry you.
You liar. You wouldn"t marry me.
I could if you"d just
put a little extra effort in.
A little extra effort?
Instead of just watching the father
of your children become tiger meat!
- Children?
- Children.
Are you all right, honey?
Who are you?
Look at me.
Rick, look at me. L"m Marianne.
Remember we were gonna get married
and have children?
l"m pleased to meet you, Marianne.
You dirty rat! Don"t even try
to weasel out of this one.
- L"II sue you for breach of promise!
- I haven"t got any money.
- What"II you get, my underpants?
- I want your underpants.
I got something I want to show you.
Get up. Get your lazy ass off.
You"ve heard that expression:
"'Something old, something new,
something borrowed and something..."'
Very blue.
Mr. Wiggly is unfurled.
And if that"s not a hint, what is?
