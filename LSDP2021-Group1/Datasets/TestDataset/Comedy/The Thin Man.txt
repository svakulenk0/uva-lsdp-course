YOUR DAUGHTER'S HERE,
MR. WYNANT.
MR. WYNANT.
MR. WYNANT!
HAVEN'T YOU GOT
ANY MORE SENSE
THAN TO SHOUT
AT ME LIKE THAT?
WELL, I'M SORRY,
BUT--
TWO WEEKS' WORK
GONE TO NOTHING!
GET YOUR THINGS!
GET OUT!
YOU'RE THROUGH!
GET OUT! GET OUT!
I'M GOING.
GOOD THING
I'M GOING AWAY.
NO PEACE.
NO QUIET.
EVERYBODY
INTERRUPTING ME.
CAN I COME IN?
DID YOU TELL HIM?
I DIDN'T
GET A CHANCE.
DAD!
WHY DIDN'T SOMEBODY
TELL ME YOU WERE HERE?
I'M SORRY
TO INTERRUPT
YOUR WORK,
DARLING,
BUT THIS REALLY
IS IMPORTANT.
HOW ARE YOU?
WHAT,
ANOTHER YOUNG MAN?
IT'S THE SAME ONE.
IT'S BEEN
THE SAME ONE
FOR THREE MONTHS.
FORGIVE ME.
HOW ARE YOU?
NOW TAKE A GOOD LOOK
AT HIM, DAD.
TRY TO REMEMBER HIM
BECAUSE...
HE'S GOING TO BE
YOUR SON-IN-LAW.
WELL!
IF IT'S ALL RIGHT
WITH YOU, SIR.
AND IF IT ISN'T?
HE'S STILL GOING TO BE
YOUR SON-IN-LAW.
YOU SEE HOW MUCH
WE HAVE TO SAY.
BUT, DAD,
THIS IS REALLY
WHAT I WANTED
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.
OH. DO YOU MIND
IF I LOOK AROUND?
NO. HELP YOURSELF.
OH, TOM, SHOW THIS--
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
HOME.
I'M FIRED.
WHO FIRED YOU?
YOU DID.
FORGET IT.
FORGET IT!
WILL YOU SHOW
THIS GENTLEMAN AROUND?
YES, SIR.
THIS WAY, SIR.
THANK YOU.
DAD, MOTHER'S PLANNING
ON A BIG CHURCH WEDDING.
YES, SHE WOULD.
I HATE ALL THAT FUSS,
BUT I'LL DO IT
ON ONE CONDITION--
THAT YOU'RE THERE TO
GIVE ME AWAY, DARLING.
WHAT WOULD YOUR MOTHER
SAY TO THAT?
IT'S MY WEDDING,
ISN'T IT?
YES, BUT WOULDN'T IT
BE EMBARRASSING
TO HAVE ALL OF US THERE--
YOUR MOTHER, ME,
YOUR STEPFATHER?
HE CAN STAY HOME.
PLEASE, DADDY,
WON'T YOU?
IF YOU THINK
IT WOULD BE ALL RIGHT.
NOW, WAIT A MINUTE.
WHEN'S IT GOING TO BE?
I'M LEAVING TOWN TONIGHT.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
THAT'S A SECRET.
I CAN'T EVEN TELL YOU.
I'VE GOT AN IMPORTANT IDEA
TO WORK ON.
WHAT?
A NEW INVENTION?
YES. I DON'T WANT SOMEBODY
TO STEAL IT FROM ME.
WE WERE PLANNING
ON BEING MARRIED
RIGHT AFTER CHRISTMAS.
I'LL BE HOME
BEFORE CHRISTMAS.
IS THAT A PROMISE?
THAT'S A PROMISE
I WON'T FORGET.
WHERE'S MacCAULAY?
IT'S TIME I STARTED.
OH, HOW'S YOUR BROTHER?
OH, HE'S ALL RIGHT.
I'D LIKE TO SEE HIM.
WHY DON'T YOU BRING HIM DOWN?
YOU KNOW HOW IT IS.
HE'S SORT OF UNDER
MOTHER'S THUMB.
YES, I KNOW.
I KNOW.
YOU'RE NOT MISSING MUCH.
HE'S CUCKOO.
LIKE ALL THE REST OF US?
SAY, HAS THIS FELLOW--
HAS HE SEEN
THE WHOLE FAMILY?
YES, AND HE STILL
WANTS TO MARRY ME.
HE'S A BRAVE MAN.
YES.
THANKS
A LOT, OLD MAN.
YOU CERTAINLY HAVE AN
INTERESTING PLANT HERE.
I DIDN'T KNOW
THAT YOU INVENTED
THAT SMELTING PROCESS,
MR. WYNANT.
THIS IS THE FIRST METAL
THAT CAME THROUGH.
THREE KINDS OF ORE--
GOLD, SILVER, COPPER.
WELL, ISN'T THAT
INTERESTING?
DADDY, DOES THAT
STILL BOTHER YOU?
ONLY
IN BAD WEATHER.
IT ISN'T
BAD WEATHER NOW.
THEN YOU'D BETTER
GET HOME BEFORE IT IS.
GOOD-BYE, DARLING,
AND DON'T FORGET--
THE 30th OF DECEMBER.
GOOD-BYE, BOY.
GOOD-BYE.
TAKE GOOD CARE
OF DOROTHY.
SHOW HER THAT
THERE IS SUCH A THING
AS A HAPPY MARRIAGE.
I'LL DO MY BEST.
GOOD-BYE.
IS IT ALL SETTLED?
MM-HMM.
GRAND! SAY, WHY DID
YOUR MOTHER DIVORCE HIM?
I THINK HE'S SWELL.
IT SEEMS HE HAS
A SECRETARY.
OH! WELL, I'LL DO
MY OWN TYPING.
OOH! DAD'S
A GOOD BAROMETER.
HERE'S A TAXI.
HELLO, MR. MacCAULAY.
OH, HOW ARE YOU?
HERE. GET UNDER THIS.
NO, NO.
WE'RE TAKING YOUR CAB.
YOUR FATHER
STILL IN THERE?
YES. HE'S
WAITING FOR YOU.
DID HE TELL YOU
WHERE HE WAS GOING?
WOULDN'T SAY.
WELL, GOOD-BYE,
MISS WYNANT.
HERE'S YOUR CHANGE,
BOSS.
YOU WOULDN'T DRIVE SLOWLY,
SO YOU DON'T GET A TIP.
THAT'S OK, SWEETHEART.
I GOT IT ANYWAY.
OH, MR. WYNANT.
HELLO THERE.
DID YOU GET MY MONEY?
I DO WISH YOU'D TELL ME
WHERE YOU'RE GOING.
I'M NOT TELLING ANYONE.
SUPPOSE SOME BUSINESS
SHOULD COME UP.
THAT'S JUST WHY
I'M GOING.
THERE'S 100, 200, 300--
OH, HERE.
NEVER MIND.
I WISH YOU'D COUNT IT.
THERE'S $1,000 THERE.
I TRUST YOU.
ISN'T THERE ANYTHING ELSE
I CAN DO FOR YOU?
HAVE YOU BOUGHT
YOUR TICKET?
NO.
LET ME DO THAT
FOR YOU.
YEAH,
YOU MIGHT DO THAT.
YOU MIGHT GET ME
A TICKET FOR...
NO, YOU DON'T.
THANKS AND GOOD-BYE.
WHAT WILL I DO
IF SOMETHING COMES UP?
SETTLE IT YOURSELF.
WHAT HAVE I GOT
A LAWYER FOR?
IS JULIA GOING
WITH YOU?
NO.
WHAT IF YOU NEED
MORE MONEY?
I'VE LEFT INSTRUCTIONS
WITH JULIA.
SHE'LL GET IT FROM YOU.
YOU DON'T TELL ME
A THING.
I DON'T KNOW
WHERE YOU'RE GOING,
WHEN YOU'RE COMING BACK,
OR HOW TO REACH YOU
IF ANY BUSINESS COMES UP!
HELLO, TANNER.
MR. WYNANT.
MY DAUGHTER'S GOING
TO BE MARRIED, TANNER.
NICE YOUNG MAN.
SHE JUST BROUGHT HIM IN.
WELL, CONGRATULATIONS.
I'M GOING TO MAKE HER
A WEDDING PRESENT.
THOUGHT I'D BETTER DO IT
NOW BEFORE I FORGET IT.
I CAN DROP THEM
ON THE WAY--
THAT'S FUNNY.
WHERE ARE THOSE BONDS?
BONDS, SIR?
I KNOW I PUT THEM
IN THERE.
MAYBE MISS WOLF
HAS THEM, SIR.
YES...
MAYBE SHE HAS.
JOE, HOW DO
YOU LIKE YOURS?
STRAIGHT.
YOU WOMEN SURE TAKE
A LOT OF PUNISHMENT.
YOU'RE IN THE WRONG
PLACE, BUDDY.
AM I?
WHAT DO YOU WANT?
WHO IS IT, JOE?
THAT'S WHAT
I WANT TO KNOW.
WE'RE JUST HAVING
A LITTLE DRINK.
YES, SO I SEE.
WELL...
SEE YOU LATER, JOE.
SORRY.
DIDN'T KNOW I WAS
TALKING TO THE BOYFRIEND.
SO LONG.
SO LONG, JOE.
WHO'S THAT MAN?
HE ISN'T ANYBODY,
JUST A FELLOW
I USED TO KNOW.
I THOUGHT YOU'D GIVEN UP
THAT SORT OF FRIEND.
IT'S THE FIRST TIME
I'VE SEEN HIM IN YEARS.
I DIDN'T WANT HIM
TO THINK
I WAS HIGH-HATTING HIM.
YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL
ABOUT THAT SORT OF THING.
DON'T WORRY.
YOU WON'T SEE HIM AGAIN.
TELL ME, DID YOU CHANGE
YOUR MIND ABOUT GOING?
NO. I JUST CAME BACK
FOR A SECOND.
I WANT TO GET THOSE...
BONDS.
BONDS?
WHAT BONDS?
THE GOVERNMENT BONDS,
THE ONES YOU TOOK
FROM THE OFFICE SAFE.
OH, YES.
YOU TOLD ME
TO SELL THOSE
A LONG TIME AGO.
I'D NEVER TELL YOU
TO SELL THOSE.
I BOUGHT THOSE
FOR MY DAUGHTER.
BUT DON'T YOU
REMEMBER--
NOW, SEE HERE, JULIA,
YOU'RE COUNTING TOO MUCH
ON MY ABSENT-MINDEDNESS.
YOU'VE BEEN TAKING A LITTLE
HERE AND THERE FOR SOME TIME
WITHOUT MY SAYING
ANYTHING ABOUT IT,
BUT THIS IS $50,000.
DO YOU REALIZE YOU'RE
ACCUSING ME OF--
NO ONE ELSE HAD THE
COMBINATION TO THAT SAFE.
YOU TOOK THEM.
WHAT DID YOU DO WITH THEM?
WHAT IF I DID TAKE THEM?
I'M SICK AND TIRED
OF SEEING YOU HAND OUT
THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS
TO YOUR FAMILY,
SUPPORTING
A GANG OF LOAFERS
THAT DON'T CARE
A DARN ABOUT YOU,
A WIFE THAT KICKED YOU OUT
THE FIRST TIME
YOUR FOOT SLIPPED.
NOT ONE WOULD RAISE
A HAND TO HELP YOU,
AND I'VE GIVEN
MY WHOLE LIFE TO YOU.
IF YOU KICKED OFF TOMORROW,
WHERE WOULD I BE?
OUT IN THE GUTTER.
I TOOK THOSE BONDS.
WHO HAS A BETTER RIGHT?
I WANT THAT MONEY,
OR I'LL HAND YOU OVER
TO THE POLICE.
GO AHEAD.
THEY'LL BE PRETTY ROUGH
WITH YOU...WITH YOUR RECORD.
THAT'S A FINE THING
TO SAY
AFTER WHAT
I'VE BEEN TO YOU.
HELLO. GIVE ME--
WELL?
ALL RIGHT.
I'LL GIVE IT TO YOU.
THAT'S ALL I'VE GOT.
YOU'RE GOING TO RETURN
EVERY CENT OF IT.
I CAN'T.
I HAVEN'T GOT IT.
WHAT DID YOU DO
WITH THE REST?
I NEVER HAD IT.
THEN THERE WAS SOMEONE
IN WITH YOU. WHO WAS IT?
I'LL ANSWER THAT.
HELLO.
HELLO.
HELLO!
HELLO!
YOU DON'T NEED
TO TELL ME.
I HAVE
A PRETTY GOOD IDEA.
WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO?
STOP WORRYING
ABOUT YOUR FATHER.
HE'LL TURN UP
ALL RIGHT.
YES, BUT, TOMMY,
TODAY'S CHRISTMAS EVE.
HE'S JUST FORGOTTEN.
YOU KNOW HOW HE
FORGETS EVERYTHING.
NO. HE NEVER FORGETS
A PROMISE TO ME.
I'M WORRIED, TOMMY.
I KNOW SOMETHING'S
HAPPENED TO HIM.
WHAT COULD HAPPEN
TO HIM, DARLING?
NOW, WILL YOU
STOP WORRYING?
YOU SEE, THE IMPORTANT
THING IS THE RHYTHM.
YOU MUST ALWAYS HAVE
RHYTHM IN YOUR SHAKING.
NOW, A MANHATTAN YOU
SHAKE TO FOX-TROT TIME,
A BRONX TO TWO-STEP
TIME.
THE DRY MARTINI
YOU ALWAYS SHAKE
TO WALTZ TIME.
OH!
MMM!
WHAT IS IT?
JUST A MINUTE.
NOW, MIND YOU,
THERE'S A STILL MORE
MODERN TREND IN--
HERE. LET ME HAVE--
THANK YOU.
CERTAIN PEOPLE--
HELLO THERE.
HELLO.
ANOTHER GLASS.
HOW ARE YOU?
YOU KNOW,
WE DO KNOW EACH OTHER.
WELL, OF COURSE WE DO.
WE'VE KNOWN
EACH OTHER FOR YEARS.
AREN'T YOU
NICK CHARLES?
YES.
YOU DON'T REMEMBER ME.
I'M DOROTHY WYNANT.
NOT THAT SCRAWNY
LITTLE BIT OF--
YES.
HOW DID YOU EVER
REMEMBER ME?
YOU USED TO FASCINATE ME--
A REAL, LIVE DETECTIVE.
YOU USED TO TELL ME
THE MOST WONDERFUL STORIES.
WERE THEY TRUE?
PROBABLY NOT.
TOMMY, THIS IS
NICK CHARLES.
HI, TOMMY.
HAVE ANOTHER GLASS.
HE WORKED ONCE
ON A CASE FOR MY FATHER.
YEAH. SOME NUT
WANTED TO KILL HIM.
HOW IS YOUR FATHER?
OH, THAT'S WHAT
I CAME TO ASK YOU.
HE'S DISAPPEARED.
DON'T SAY THAT,
DARLING.
HE'S JUST AWAY
SOMEWHERE WORKING.
I CAN'T FIND HIM.
I'VE TRIED EVERYTHING.
I THOUGHT
YOU MIGHT KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING.
I'VE BEEN IN CALIFORNIA
FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS.
WHAT ABOUT
HIS LAWYER?
USED TO BE SOME BIRD BY
THE NAME OF MAC, UH...
OH, MacCAULAY?
HERBERT MacCAULAY.
I TRIED HIM ONCE.
TRY HIM AGAIN.
HERE'S A NICKEL.
THANK YOU.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
YOU KNOW, SHE'S GOT
ME WORRYING, TOO.
OH, YOU MUSTN'T
WORRY ABOUT HIM.
MIND YOU, HE'S
A GREAT GUY BUT SCREWY.
MADAM,
I'M VERY SORRY,
BUT NO DOG...
ASTA!
I'M SORRY, MADAM.
NO DOGS ALLOWED.
YOU CANNOT TAKE
THE DOG IN THERE.
I'M NOT TAKING HIM.
HE'S TAKING ME.
OH!
ARE YOU HURT, MADAM?
NO. WOMEN AND CHILDREN
FIRST, BOYS.
WHAT IS THE SCORE
ANYWAY?
OH, SO IT'S YOU
HE WAS AFTER.
HELLO, SUGAR.
HE'S DRAGGED ME INTO
EVERY GIN MILL ON THE BLOCK.
I HAD HIM OUT
THIS MORNING.
I THOUGHT SO.
THIS IS TOMMY.
MY WIFE.
HOW ARE YOU,
TOMMY?
TOMMY, I DON'T USUALLY
LOOK LIKE THIS.
I'VE BEEN
CHRISTMAS SHOPPING.
MADAM, I'M AFRAID
WE SHALL TAKE THE DOG OUT.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
IT'S MY DOG...
AND MY WIFE.
YOU MIGHT HAVE MENTIONED
ME FIRST ON THE BILLING.
THE DOG'S
WELL-TRAINED.
HE'LL BEHAVE
HIMSELF.
HE MIGHT
BITE SOMEBODY.
HE'S ALL RIGHT.
LOOK. LIE DOWN.
LIE DOWN.
STAND UP.
SEE?
ANY LUCK?
YES. HE'S JUST
AROUND THE CORNER.
YOUR FATHER?
NO. MacCAULAY.
I'M JUST GOING TO
GO AND SEE HIM.
OH, UH, MY WIFE.
THIS IS
DOROTHY WYNANT.
I'M SORRY
WE HAVE TO RUSH.
WE'RE STOPPING
IN THE NORMANDIE
FOR A COUPLE WEEKS.
DROP AROUND. SEE US.
WE'D LOVE TO.
THANK YOU. GOOD-BYE.
SIT DOWN,
SUGAR.
OH, LEO,
UH...
YES, SIR.
TWO COCKTAILS.
PRETTY GIRL.
YES. SHE'S
A VERY NICE TYPE.
YOU GOT TYPES?
ONLY YOU, DARLING--
LANKY BRUNETTES
WITH WICKED JAWS.
LEO.
COMPLIMENTS
OF THE SEASON.
WHO IS SHE?
OH, DARLING,
I WAS HOPING
I WOULDN'T
HAVE TO ANSWER THAT.
COME ON.
WELL, DOROTHY IS
REALLY MY DAUGHTER.
YOU SEE, IT WAS
SPRING IN VENICE,
AND I WAS SO YOUNG,
I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT I WAS DOING.
WE'RE ALL LIKE THAT
ON MY FATHER'S SIDE.
BY THE WAY,
HOW IS YOUR FATHER'S SIDE?
IT'S MUCH BETTER,
THANKS. AND YOURS?
HOW MANY DRINKS
HAVE YOU HAD?
THIS WILL MAKE
SIX MARTINIS.
ALL RIGHT. WILL YOU BRING ME
FIVE MORE MARTINIS, LEO?
AND LINE THEM
RIGHT UP HERE.
YES, MA'AM.
HMM...
WHAT HIT ME?
THE LAST MARTINI.
HOW ABOUT A PICK-ME-UP?
NO!
I CAN'T LIE HERE.
I'VE GOT TO GET UP
AND TRIM THAT DARN
CHRISTMAS TREE.
WHAT'S THE IDEA
OF PUSHING ME?
WHO'S THAT?
IT'S PROBABLY
SANTA CLAUS.
HELLO, MacCAULAY!
COME IN.
DOROTHY TOLD ME
YOU WERE HERE.
I WAS GOING TO
TELEPHONE, BUT--
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
SIT DOWN, WON'T YOU?
WHAT ARE YOU DRINKING?
OH, NOTHING. THANKS.
NOTHING.
OH, THAT'S
A MISTAKE.
I WANTED TO SEE YOU.
WHAT'S MIMI UP TO,
MR. CHARLES?
DOROTHY'S MOTHER?
DOES SHE HAVE TO
BE UP TO SOMETHING?
SHE USUALLY IS--
TRYING ONE WAY OR ANOTHER
TO GET MONEY OUT OF WYNANT.
I WANTED TO FIND OUT
IF YOU WERE, UH...
SLEUTHING FOR HER.
I HAVEN'T BEEN
A DETECTIVE IN FOUR YEARS.
IS THAT SO?
MY WIFE'S FATHER DIED
AND LEFT HER
A NARROW-GAUGE RAILWAY,
LUMBERMILL, AND, UH...
OH, SEVERAL
OTHER THINGS.
I'M TAKING CARE
OF THEM.
WHAT'S THE FUSS ABOUT?
IS HE IN HIDING?
YOU KNOW AS MUCH
ABOUT IT AS I DO.
I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM
IN THREE MONTHS.
NO WORD AT ALL?
HE SENDS WORD THROUGH
HIS SECRETARY JULIA WOLF
WHEN HE WANTS MONEY.
I GIVE IT TO HER,
AND SHE GIVES IT TO HIM.
THAT'S STILL ON, HUH?
EXCUSE ME.
HELLO?
OH, JUST A MINUTE.
FOR YOU.
IS THERE A MR. MacCAULAY
IN THE HOUSE?
OH. OH, PARDON ME.
YES?
OH, JUST A MOMENT.
MY WIFE.
HOW DO YOU DO?
HOW DO YOU DO?
YES? WHAT WERE
YOU SAYING?
HE IS?
WELL, WHERE
IS HE NOW?
OH, VERY WELL.
OH, EXCUSE US.
HE'S BACK IN TOWN--
WYNANT.
WYNANT?
YES. HE'S WAITING
FOR ME NOW.
FORGIVE ME,
MRS. CHARLES,
BUT I'VE
BEEN SO UPSET.
YOU KNOW,
IT'S NO JOKE
WORKING FOR A MAN
LIKE THAT.
WELL, I GUESS
I'D BETTER BE OFF.
GOOD-BYE.
GOOD-BYE.
MERRY CHRISTMAS.
SAME TO YOU.
NEXT PERSON THAT SAYS
"MERRY CHRISTMAS" TO ME,
I'LL KILL THEM.
I'M GOING TO TELEPHONE
THAT POOR CHILD.
AT LEAST SHE'LL BE GLAD
TO KNOW HE'S ALIVE.
ASTA!
HELLO?
OH! HOW ARE YOU?
OH, I'M
MRS. JORGENSON NOW.
DOROTHY?
NO, SHE ISN'T HERE.
IS IT SOMETHING
ABOUT HER FATHER?
PERHAPS I CAN TAKE
THE MESSAGE.
OH, UH...
HERE SHE IS NOW.
HELLO?
I JUST WANTED
TO RELIEVE YOUR MIND.
HE'S ALIVE,
AND HE'S ALL RIGHT.
OH, THANK GOODNESS.
WHAT IS IT?
HAS HE FOUND HIM?
DO YOU KNOW
WHERE HE'S LIVING?
OH. WELL, AT LEAST
I'M GLAD HE'S ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU FOR CALLING.
GOOD-BYE.
WHAT IS IT?
WHAT IS IT?
NOTHING.
IT'S SOMETHING
ABOUT YOUR FATHER.
WHERE IS HE?
HE'S ALL RIGHT.
ISN'T THAT ENOUGH?
NO!
YOU JUST WANT MONEY,
AND YOU HAVEN'T
ANY RIGHT TO ANY MORE.
HE MADE
A BIG SETTLEMENT ON YOU.
THAT'S GONE LONG AGO.
WHERE IS HE?
MOTHER, I WON'T HAVE
YOU HOUNDING HIM
FOR MORE MONEY.
I CAN TELL YOU,
MOTHER.
YOU'VE BEEN LISTENING
ON THAT EXTENSION.
OF COURSE.
WHAT'S AN EXTENSION FOR?
THAT'S RIGHT, GILBERT.
WHAT DID HE SAY?
HE SAID THAT
FATHER'S IN TOWN.
HE'S BEEN SEEING JULIA
RIGHT ALONG.
THAT WOMAN!
SHE CAN TELL YOU
WHERE FATHER IS.
MOTHER,
YOU WOULDN'T GO TO HER.
I DIDN'T
SAY I WOULD,
BUT WE'VE GOT
TO HAVE MONEY.
DID IT EVER OCCUR TO YOU
THAT CHRIS MIGHT WORK?
SHH!
OH!
NOW YOU'VE HURT
HIS FEELINGS!
CHRIS?
YOU HAVE AN OEDIPUS COMPLEX,
AND YOU WON'T ADMIT IT.
PLEASE, GILBERT.
THE TROUBLE WITH YOU IS
YOU WON'T FACE FACTS.
NOW, I KNOW I HAVE
A MOTHER FIXATION,
BUT IT'S SLIGHT.
IT HASN'T YET REACHED
THE POINT OF WHERE--
STOP IT, GILBERT.
STOP IT.
DON'T MIND
WHAT SHE SAYS, CHRIS.
HOW CAN I HELP
BUT MIND?
I'M CONSTANTLY
HUMILIATED
JUST BECAUSE
I HAVEN'T MONEY.
I'LL GET SOME.
YES. YOU'VE SAID
THAT FOR WEEKS.
WHY DON'T YOU SEE JULIA?
SHE HANDLES HIS MONEY.
CHRIS!
ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT.
I COULDN'T GO NEAR
THAT WOMAN!
I SAID ALL RIGHT.
WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO?
WHAT I SAID I'D DO.
YOU WOULDN'T!
WOULDN'T I?
JUST WATCH ME.
OH, CHRIS!
CHRIS!
CHRIS!
CHRIS!
GET ME MISS WOLF
AT THE CLARKSTON
APARTMENTS.
HELLO...MISS WOLF?
UH, THIS IS
MRS. JORGENSON.
I WONDER
IF I MAY SEE YOU.
YES, OF COURSE.
THANK YOU.
MISS WOLF'S
APARTMENT, PLEASE.
CALLING, PLEASE?
NEVER MIND. MISS WOLF
IS EXPECTING ME.
MISS WOLF?
MISS WOLF!
AAH!
QUICK! QUICK!
SEND SOMEBODY
UP HERE RIGHT AWAY.
SOMETHING TERRIBLE
HAS HAPPENED!
JULIA WOLF.
THAT'S ME.
WHAT IS IT?
WOMAN MURDERED.
WHERE YOU BEEN?
OUT MAKING MONEY.
LET'S SEE IT.
I HAVEN'T
GOT IT YET,
BUT I'LL GET IT.
COME ON. GIVE OUT,
GIRLS. GIVE OUT.
SHAKE THE BODIES
A LITTLE.
GET THE RHYTHM.
KEEP IT UP.
I CAN'T HEAR ANY RHYTHM.
COME ON.
SHAKE YOUR FEET.
HELLO, MORELLI.
HIYA, STUTSY.
HEY, UH...
DIDN'T YOU KNOW
JULIA WOLF?
YEAH.
WHY?
SOMEBODY JUST
BUMPED HER OFF.
I THOUGHT MAYBE
YOU'D LIKE TO KNOW.
YES?
TELEPHONE, MR. MacCAULAY.
WHO IS IT?
THE POLICE.
HELLO?
MURDERED?
YES. YES, I'LL
BE RIGHT OVER.
WHAT YOU GONNA
TELL THEM?
I'M GONNA TELL THEM
EVERYTHING.
YOU DON'T THINK
MR. WYNANT--
I DON'T THINK ANYTHING,
BUT I HEARD AN AWFUL FIGHT
IN THERE A WHILE AGO!
ALL RIGHT, GIRLS.
OH, YES. COME ON.
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU
GAVE HER MONEY FOR WYNANT?
YESTERDAY.
I GAVE HER $1,000.
ANY SIGNS
OF THAT, BILL?
NO.
PERHAPS IT WAS
A ROBBERY.
HER WITH THAT SPARKLER ON HER
FINGER AND $30 IN HER PURSE?
IT LOOKS LIKE OUR FRIEND
WYNANT CAME TO COLLECT
AND RAN INTO
A LITTLE TROUBLE.
DOWNSTAIRS THEY HAVEN'T
SEEN HIM IN THREE MONTHS.
THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS
THEY DON'T SEE HERE.
YOU SAY YOU HAVEN'T HEARD
FROM HIM IN THAT TIME?
I SAID HE HADN'T
WRITTEN ME.
THEN YOU HAVE
HEARD FROM HIM.
HE TELEPHONED ME
TODAY.
I WASN'T IN.
MY SECRETARY TOOK
THE MESSAGE.
HE LEFT WORD FOR ME
TO MEET HIM
AT THE PLAZA.
WHAT TIME?
ABOUT 3:00.
DID YOU GO?
YES.
HE DIDN'T SHOW.
HIS HOUSE AND SHOP
IS CLOSED,
AND HE AIN'T
AT ANY HOTEL.
SO YOU SEEN YOUR DUTY,
AND YOU DONE IT, HUH?
YOU GONNA STOP AT THAT?
NO, SIR.
HE'LL TURN UP WHEN HE
SEES THIS IN THE PAPERS.
YOU CAN'T THINK HE HAD
ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT.
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY FOUGHT ABOUT
THAT NIGHT HE WENT AWAY?
I DIDN'T KNOW
THEY HAD A FIGHT.
WELL, THANKS.
WE'LL GET IN TOUCH WITH YOU
WHEN WE NEED YOU AGAIN.
I MAY GO?
YEAH, GO AHEAD.
MR. GUILD,
COME HERE.
HERE'S SOMETHING
VERY INTERESTING.
HMM...
AND THERE SHE WAS,
LYING ON THE FLOOR DEAD.
THE POLICE SAID THAT
SHE'D BEEN KILLED
ABOUT 10 MINUTES
BEFORE I GOT THERE.
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU WEREN'T GOING THERE.
DID THEY
FIND ANY CLUES?
A GUN, FINGERPRINTS?
NOT A THING.
WAS THERE
MUCH BLOOD?
GILBERT, DON'T BE
SO HORRIBLE!
NONSENSE. SHE GOT
WHAT SHE DESERVED.
DID YOU KILL HER?
YOU HAD A PERFECTLY
GOOD MOTIVE.
DON'T TALK LIKE THAT
WHEN
THE POLICE GET HERE.
YOU SAID THEY'D
FINISHED WITH YOU.
THEY'D FINISHED
FOR THE PRESENT.
I'VE GOT MY ALIBI.
I WAS AT THE LIBRARY.
WHERE WERE YOU?
CHILDREN, I WANT TO
SPEAK TO CHRIS ALONE.
WELL, I'LL GO.
I'LL BE IN MY ROOM.
IS MRS. JORGENSON IN?
YES. COME RIGHT IN.
OH, MRS. JORGENSON,
A FEW POINTS
I'D LIKE TO CLEAR UP.
WHY, YES. YES.
WON'T YOU SIT DOWN?
THANK YOU.
YOU WERE IN THE ROOM
WITH THE BODY
FROM THE TIME IT WAS
DISCOVERED UNTIL WE CAME?
WHY, YES.
DID YOU, UH...
DID YOU SEE ANYTHING
IN MISS WOLF'S HAND?
OH, NO.
ARE YOU SURE
THAT AT NO TIME
YOU LEFT THE ROOM
FOR A MOMENT,
THAT A MAID OR BELLBOY
MIGHT HAVE SLIPPED IN THERE
AND BEEN ALONE
WITH THE BODY?
I DON'T THINK SO.
I WAS SO UPSET,
I HARDLY KNEW
WHAT I WAS DOING.
THE MEDICAL EXAMINER
SEEMS TO THINK THAT, UH...
THAT THE BODY
HAD BEEN TOUCHED,
THAT SOMEONE HAD FORCED
OPEN THE GIRL'S HAND
AFTER SHE'D BEEN KILLED.
MOREOVER, WE FOUND THAT
SHE HAD IN HER POSSESSION
$1,000 THE NIGHT BEFORE.
I'M SORRY
I CAN'T HELP YOU.
HMM...
WELL, THAT'S
QUITE ALL RIGHT.
WE'LL BE GOING ALONG.
THANK YOU.
GOOD-BYE.
GOOD-BYE.
COULD I COME DOWN
AND SEE THE BODY?
I'VE NEVER SEEN
A DEAD BODY.
WHY DO YOU WANT TO?
I'VE BEEN STUDYING
PSYCHOPATHIC CRIMINOLOGY,
AND I HAVE A THEORY.
PERHAPS THIS WAS THE WORK
OF A SADIST
OR A PARANOIAC.
IF I SAW IT, I MIGHT
BE ABLE TO TELL.
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA,
BUT DON'T BOTHER
TO COME DOWN.
WE'LL BRING THE BODY
RIGHT UP TO YOU.
WHAT HAVE YOU
GOT THERE?
NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.
YOU TOOK THAT MONEY
FROM HER HAND.
I DIDN'T.
WHAT ARE YOU HIDING?
EVIDENCE THAT'S WORTH
A GREAT DEAL MORE THAN THAT.
HAND THAT OVER
TO THE POLICE.
I'LL DO NOTHING
OF THE SORT.
VERY WELL. I WILL.
I DON'T THINK YOU WILL.
IT'S YOUR FATHER'S.
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.
YOU'RE LYING!
THERE.
OH! OH...
NOW WILL YOU
BELIEVE ME?
AMMUNITION?
COME ON, STOCK UP.
NO. LET
THIS ONE RIDE.
YOU'D BETTER.
HARD TIMES MAY CATCH YOU.
NICK, WHO ARE
THESE AMAZING PEOPLE?
JUST A LOT
OF OLD FRIENDS.
ROMANS, COUNTRYMEN,
WHAT DO YOU SAY?
THIS IS LIKE
OLD TIMES, NICK.
REMEMBER THE FUN WE HAD
WHEN WE WERE BROKE?
DON'T I?
THOSE WERE
THE GOOD OLD DAYS.
DON'T KID YOURSELF.
THESE ARE THE GOOD OLD DAYS.
HEY, NICK, I THINK
YOUR WIFE IS GREAT.
THANKS. I WANTED
YOU TO SEE HER...
AND I WANTED HER
TO SEE YOU.
WANT TO BUY A PIECE
OF THIS PUG, NICK?
I'LL SELL YOU 25%
OF HIM FOR 5 GRAND.
IS HE GOOD?
HE'S BEEN KNOCKING THEM COLD.
AIN'T AFRAID OF NOBODY.
PUT THAT DOWN,
OR I'LL SLUG YOU.
HAVING A GOOD TIME?
SWELL.
HERE'S THAT MAN AGAIN.
AMMUNITION?
THANK YOU.
YOU'RE VERY WELCOME.
THANK YOU.
HIGHBALLS AND COCKTAILS--
THE LONG AND SHORT OF IT.
THAT'S A PUN.
THE PUNSTER
SHOULD BE PUNISHED.
* FOR TOMORROW
MAY BRING SORROW *
* SO TONIGHT,
LET US BE GAY **
ANOTHER COCKTAIL?
THANK YOU
VERY MUCH.
OH, DO.
I CERTAINLY THINK
YOUR HUSBAND'S GREAT.
WELL, I'M GLAD
SOMEBODY DOES.
COCKTAILS?
HAVE A COCKTAIL?
THANKS.
NICK CHARLES HERE?
YES.
YOU'RE HIS WIFE?
YES. HEY, NICK!
NICE GUY. SENT ME UP
THE RIVER ONE TIME.
HELLO, FACE.
LONG TIME NO SEE.
LONG TIME.
I NEEDED THE REST.
WAS HE
A GOOD DETECTIVE?
I WOULDN'T KNOW.
THAT TIME HE CAUGHT ME
WAS AN ACCIDENT.
COME ON, KID.
SHED THE CHAPEAU.
DIVEST YOURSELF
OF RAIMENT
AND JOIN
THE YULETIDE REVELERS.
HEY, REVELERS, I WANT YOU
TO KNOW FACE PEPLER.
ALL YOU GOT TO DO
IS FIND OUT WHO THEY ARE.
DON'T BOTHER
TO ANNOUNCE ANYONE.
JUST SEND
THEM ALL UP.
I KNOW.
IT'S QUITE ALL RIGHT.
THEY'RE ALL HIS FRIENDS.
...THE JULIA WOLF MURDER.
POLICE HAVE FOUND OUT THAT
THE BEAUTIFUL, BLOND SECRETARY
WAS ONCE A GANGSTER'S GIRL.
THEY'RE NOW LOOKING
FOR THE GANGSTER.
CLYDE WYNANT, THE GIRL'S
EMPLOYER, IS STILL MISSING.
CAN'T YOU FELLAS THINK
OF ANYTHING BUT BUSINESS?
GOOD CASE FOR YOU.
HAVEN'T YOU HEARD THE NEWS?
I'M A GENTLEMAN NOW.
NICK, REPORTERS.
SALUTATIONS,
BOYS.
YOU'RE JUST THE MAN
I WANT TO SEE.
I'M FROM THE AMERICAN,
MR. CHARLES.
WE WERE WONDERING IF
YOU'LL GIVE US A STATEMENT.
WE HEAR YOU'RE ON
THE JULIA WOLF CASE.
I DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT IT.
GIVE US A BREAK.
I NEVER TRY
TO KID REPORTERS.
I'M TELLING YOU
THE TRUTH.
WHY ARE YOU
IN TOWN?
MY WIFE'S ON A BENDER.
I'M TRYING TO
SOBER HER UP.
OH, WAITER,
DRINKS, PLEASE.
INTO THE KITCHEN,
SON,
AND THAW OUT
SOME ICE.
GRANDMA, WHAT LARGE
GLASSES YOU HAVE.
IS HE WORKING
ON A CASE?
YES, YES.
WHAT CASE?
A CASE OF SCOTCH.
PITCH IN AND HELP HIM.
SAY, I'VE GOT TO
ORDER SOME FOOD.
ISN'T IT
A WASTE OF ENERGY?
THAT SOUNDS LIKE
AN INTERESTING CASE.
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE IT?
I HAVEN'T TIME.
I'M TOO BUSY SEEING
THAT YOU DON'T LOSE
ANY OF THE MONEY
I MARRIED YOU FOR.
ROOM SERVICE, PLEASE.
IT SOUNDS LIKE
A GOOD CASE.
A GIRL MYSTERIOUSLY MURDERED.
NOBODY KNOWS WHO DID IT.
THEY HAVEN'T FOUND ANY CLUES--
NO GUN, NO FINGERPRINTS.
I'LL BET YOU DOLLARS
TO DOG BISCUITS
THAT THEY NEVER
THOUGHT OF--
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR
ANYTHING ABOUT IT.
IS THAT MY DRINK
OVER THERE?
WHAT ARE YOU DRINKING?
RYE.
YES, THAT'S YOURS.
SEND ME UP A WHOLE FLOCK
OF SANDWICHES.
I'D LIKE TO
TELEPHONE MY MOTHER
AND WISH HER
A MERRY CHRISTMAS.
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU?
WELL, I HAVEN'T GOT
ANY NICKELS.
OH, FORGET
THE NICKELS.
THERE YOU ARE, RIGHT
THERE. GO AHEAD.
THANK YOU.
HAVE A HUNKA?
I'LL HAVE TWO HUNKAS.
ATTABOY.
HELLO. GIVE ME
LONG DISTANCE.
I WANT TO TALK
TO SAN FRANCISCO.
NICK, I'VE
GOT TO SEE YOU...
ALONE.
HELLO THERE,
BEAUTIFUL.
COME ON.
I'LL TAKE YOU OVER HERE.
LOOK WHAT'S COME
TO OUR PARTY.
LET'S GET AWAY
FROM THE WOLVES.
WHO'S THE LITTLE
BRUNETTE?
I USED TO BOUNCE HER
ON MY KNEE.
WHICH KNEE?
CAN I TOUCH IT?
WELL, BABY,
WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND?
YOU HEARD
ABOUT JULIA WOLF?
YEAH.
THERE.
OH, NICK! NICK,
YOU'RE HURTING ME.
OF COURSE. THAT'S
WHAT I INTEND TO DO.
WHAT ARE YOU
TRYING TO TELL ME,
THAT YOU DID IT?
YES, I KILLED HER.
SIT DOWN.
I HATED HER FOR COMING
BETWEEN MY MOTHER AND FATHER.
SHE KEPT ME
FROM SEEING MY FATHER.
I WENT DOWN THERE
TO ASK HER WHERE HE WAS,
AND SHE WOULDN'T TELL ME,
SO I SHOT HER.
HOW MANY TIMES?
ONCE OR TWICE.
WHERE DID YOU
HIT HER?
I HIT HER IN THE--
IN THE HEART.
WHAT DID SHE DO?
SHE FELL OVER.
DID SHE SCREAM?
YES.
WHICH WAY
DID SHE FALL?
SHE FELL OVER
BACKWARDS.
WHOM ARE YOU
TRYING TO PROTECT?
OH, NICK, I--
NOW WAIT A MINUTE.
SHE WAS SHOT FOUR TIMES.
SHE FELL ON HER FACE.
SHE COULDN'T HAVE
SCREAMED
BECAUSE SHE
WAS KILLED INSTANTLY.
WHO DO YOU THINK DID IT?
I DON'T KNOW.
WHERE DID YOU
GET THIS GUN?
I BOUGHT IT
IN A PAWNSHOP.
IS THAT ANOTHER LIE?
NO, NICK.
THAT'S THE TRUTH.
OH, I'M SORRY.
DON'T BE SILLY.
TAKE THIS DRINK.
NO, THANK YOU.
WANT TO POWDER
YOUR NOSE?
EVERYTHING'S
OVER THERE.
WHERE DID YOU
GET THAT?
SHE BROUGHT IT IN,
TRYING TO MAKE ME
BELIEVE THAT SHE DID IT.
WHAT ARE YOU GOING
TO DO WITH IT?
NOTHING, TILL I FIND OUT
IF IT'S THE GUN
THAT JULIA WOLF
WAS KILLED WITH.
DON'T LET THE REPORTERS
GET TO HER.
THEY MAY BELIEVE HER.
SAY, ISN'T THAT
DOROTHY WYNANT?
YES. WAIT A MINUTE.
SHE DOESN'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT IT.
AND YOU SAID YOU
WEREN'T ON THE CASE.
I'M NOT.
HELLO! HELLO, MA!
HERE. GIVE ME THAT,
WILL YOU?
WAIT. IT'S SAN FRANCISCO.
HIYA, MA!
MA, GET OFF THE WIRE.
I WANT TO TALK BUSINESS.
OPERATOR, GIVE ME
DRY DOCK 4-8000.
HEY! HEY! DON'T DO THAT.
DON'T TELL YOUR PAPER
I'M WORKING ON ANYTHING,
BECAUSE I'M NOT.
HE'S WORKING ON
THAT LITTLE GIRL.
WELCOME TO--
OH, NICK! NICK!
MIMI! WELL,
FOR THE LOVE--
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT
SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT.
I KNOW.
IT'S A CONVENTION.
YOU GOT YOUR ROLLER SKATES ON?
LET'S GET ROLLING.
I'LL TAKE YOU RIGHT, UH...
NO. HERE, LET'S, UH...
IF YOU DON'T MIND, WE'LL...
LET'S JUST STEP IN HERE.
WELL!
I'M SORRY, MIMI,
BUT IT'S THE ONLY PLACE
WE CAN BE ALONE.
WON'T YOU, UH...
SIT DOWN?
WHY, HELLO,
MR. WYNANT.
COME IN
AND HAVE A DRINK.
I DON'T DRINK.
I TELL YOU CLYDE WYNANT
IS ABSOLUTELY CRAZY
TO STAY AWAY
AT A TIME LIKE THIS.
NO WONDER THE POLICE THINK HE
HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
I KNOW THAT HE HASN'T,
BUT I WANT TO SEE HIM.
THERE'S SOMETHING IMPORTANT
I WANT TO TELL HIM.
MacCAULAY WON'T HELP A BIT.
HE THINKS I JUST WANT MONEY.
DON'T YOU?
OH, YOU'RE
ALWAYS TEASING.
I BEG YOUR PARDON.
WE'RE JUST CHATTING.
NICK, YOU WILL HELP ME
FIND CLYDE, WON'T YOU?
MIMI, THERE ARE A THOUSAND
DETECTIVES IN NEW YORK.
WHY DON'T YOU HIRE
ONE OF THEM?
YES, BUT HE KNOWS YOU.
JUST GET IN TOUCH WITH HIM
AND TELL HIM MIMI SAYS
EVERYTHING IS ALL RIGHT
BUT THAT I'VE
JUST GOT TO SEE HIM.
I DON'T WANT
ANY PART OF IT.
YOU TAKE
DOROTHY HOME--
DOROTHY?
IS SHE HERE?
YES. SHE'S IN THERE
WITH MY WIFE.
WHAT DID YOU TELL THEM?
WHAT DID YOU TELL THEM?
WAIT A MINUTE.
IT'S TOO BAD YOU
DIDN'T BRING YOUR WHIP.
SHE DIDN'T
TELL US A THING.
I WAS SO EXCITED,
I DIDN'T REALIZE
WHAT I WAS DOING.
COME ON, DOROTHY.
WE'LL GO HOME.
SHE DOESN'T HAVE TO GO
IF SHE DOESN'T WANT TO.
YOU CAN STAY HERE.
WE'D LOVE TO HAVE YOU.
THAT'S SWEET OF YOU.
NO, THANKS. I'LL GO.
WHERE'S GILBERT?
GILBERT?
IS HE HERE?
WE MIGHT AS WELL BE
LIVING IN THE LOBBY.
THERE'S A PHYSIOLOGICAL
AS WELL AS PSYCHOLOGICAL ANGLE
IN MY FATHER'S RELATIONSHIP
WITH JULIA WOLF
THAT THE POLICE
HAVE OVERLOOKED,
AND I THINK IT SETTLES
THE WHOLE QUESTION.
YOU SEE, MY FATHER
WAS A SEXAGENARIAN.
HE WAS?
YES. HE ADMITTED IT.
A SEXAGENARIAN, EH?
BUT WE CAN'T PUT
THAT IN THE PAPER.
WELL, WHY NOT?
YOU KNOW HOW
THEY ARE. SEX?
THEN JUST SAY
THAT HE WAS 60 YEARS OLD.
IS THAT WHAT
THAT MEANS?
OF COURSE.
HEY, THAT'S MY HAT.
COME AND GET IT
WHILE IT'S HOT.
COME ON.
GIVE US A BREAK.
I SWEAR I DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT IT.
TELEPHONE, NICKY.
TELEPHONE.
OH, I THOUGHT
IT WAS THE DOOR.
HELLO?
MR. CHARLES, I'D LIKE TO LAY
A PROPOSITION BEFORE YOU.
WELL, I CAN'T DISCUSS IT
OVER THE TELEPHONE,
BUT IF YOU'LL GIVE ME
A HALF-HOUR OF YOUR TIME...
YEAH. IT'S ABOUT JULIA WOLF.
HELLO?
HELLO?
WHAT IS IT?
AW...SOME GUY TRYING
TO SELL ME INSURANCE.
WHERE'S
MISS WYNANT?
WHY, SHE'S GONE.
WHICH WAY
DID SHE GO?
SHE WENT OUT
THE BACK DOOR.
YOU MEAN
THE LITTLE BRUNETTE?
YES.
OH, I'M SORRY,
OLD FELLOW.
THANKS. I'M ENGAGED
FOR THIS ONE.
WAIT. NO.
DON'T DO THAT.
I WANT TO TALK TO MA.
SO YOU THINK YOU'RE
A FIGHTER, EH? HA!
SO WHAT?
SO LISTEN, WORM!
OH, NICKY...
I LOVE YOU,
BECAUSE YOU KNOW
SUCH LOVELY PEOPLE.
NICK.
NICKY.
WHAT?
YOU ASLEEP?
YES.
GOOD. I WANT
TO TALK TO YOU.
WELL, THAT'S JOLLY.
WOULDN'T YOU LIKE TO DO
A LITTLE DETECTING
ONCE IN A WHILE
JUST FOR FUN?
CAN'T YOU
GET TO SLEEP?
NO.
MAYBE IF YOU TOOK A DRINK,
IT'D HELP YOU.
NO, THANKS.
MAYBE IT'D HELP
IF I TOOK IT.
EVERYBODY SAYS YOU'RE
A GRAND DETECTIVE.
WELL, THEY WERE
KIDDING YOU.
I'D LIKE TO
SEE YOU WORK.
TOMORROW MORNING,
I'LL GET YOU A WHOLE LOT
OF DETECTIVE STORIES.
I KNOW, BUT THAT GIRL'S
IN A TOUGH SPOT.
THERE'S NOTHING
I CAN DO TO HELP HER.
SHE THINKS YOU CAN.
WOULDN'T HURT YOU TO TRY
AND SEE IF YOU COULD.
WELL, DARLING,
MY GUESS IS...
WYNANT KILLED JULIA
AND THAT DOROTHY
KNOWS ABOUT IT.
POLICE WILL CATCH HIM
WITHOUT ANY HELP FROM ME.
I THINK I WOULD
LIKE THAT DRINK.
HA HA...
MY DARLING.
I'LL GIVE YOU YOUR
CHRISTMAS PRESENT NOW
IF YOU'LL GIVE ME MINE.
AT BREAKFAST.
WELL, IT'S
CHRISTMAS NOW.
UH...
BREAKFAST.
WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO GIVE ME?
I HOPE
I DON'T LIKE IT.
YOU'LL HAVE TO
KEEP THEM ANYWAY
BECAUSE THE MAN
AT THE AQUARIUM SAID
HE WOULDN'T
TAKE THEM BACK.
DID YOU HEAR
A KNOCK?
YES.
WELL, IT MIGHT BE
SOMETHING IMPORTANT.
WELL, SURE, IT IS.
MR. CHARLES HERE?
YES.
I GOT TO TALK TO HIM.
THAT'S ALL,
BUT I GOT TO DO THAT.
ALL RIGHT.
COME IN.
YOU WAIT HERE.
I'LL TELL HIM
YOU'RE HERE.
AARR...
WHAT IN
THE NAME OF--
SOMEONE TO SEE YOU,
DEAR.
GOOD. I WAS AFRAID I WAS
ABOUT TO GO TO SLEEP.
GET OUT OF THAT BED.
LET ME STRAIGHTEN THIS UP.
YOU'RE WORSE
THAN AN INFANT.
FUNNY. I THINK
THOSE BLANKETS
MUST BE
A LITTLE COCKEYED.
RIGHT, ASTA?
THERE.
YOU'VE GOT THE FUNNIEST
LOOK ON YOUR FACE
I EVER SAW IN MY LIFE.
HURRY UP. THAT MAN'S
WAITING FOR YOU.
I WANT YOU TO
TELL ME SOMETHING.
GIVE IT TO ME STRAIGHT.
GET ME?
WOULD YOU MIND
PUTTING THAT GUN AWAY?
MY WIFE DOESN'T CARE,
BUT I'M A TIMID FELLOW.
YOU IDIOT.
ASTA! ASTA,
COME HERE.
ALL RIGHT, SHOOT--
I MEAN, UH...
WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND?
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
TELL ME YOU'RE TOUGH.
I HEARD ABOUT YOU.
I'M JOE MORELLI.
I NEVER HEARD ABOUT YOU.
I DIDN'T KNOCK
JULIA OFF.
ALL RIGHT, YOU DIDN'T.
I AIN'T SEEN HER
IN ABOUT THREE MONTHS.
WE WAS ALL WASHED UP.
I WOULDN'T HAVE
ANY REASON TO HURT HER.
SHE WAS ALWAYS
ON THE UP AND UP WITH ME,
BUT THAT DIRTY LITTLE NUNHEIM
GOT SORE WITH HER
BECAUSE I CLICKED
AND HE DIDN'T,
AND HE PUT
THE FINGER ON ME.
THIS IS ALL SWELL, BROTHER,
BUT YOU'RE PEDDLING YOUR
FISH IN THE WRONG MARKET.
STUTSY BURKE SAYS
YOU USED TO BE OK.
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.
HOW IS STUTSY?
I DIDN'T KNOW
HE WAS OUT OF STIR.
HE'S ALL RIGHT.
HE'D LIKE TO SEE YOU.
WHAT'S THE LAW
DOING TO ME?
DO THEY THINK I DID IT?
OR IS IT SOMETHING ELSE
TO PIN ON ME?
IF I KNEW,
I'D TELL YOU.
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.
ASK THE POLICE.
THAT WOULD BE THE SMARTEST
THING I EVER DID--
THE POLICE CAPTAIN'S
BEEN IN THE HOSPITAL 3 WEEKS
ON ACCOUNT OF
WE HAD AN ARGUMENT.
THE BOYS WOULD LIKE THAT
DOWN TO THEIR BLACKJACKS.
STUTSY SAYS
YOU'RE ON THE LEVEL.
WHY DON'T YOU BE
ON THE LEVEL?
I AM ON THE LEVEL.
IF I KNEW ANYTHING--
WHAT'S THAT?
I DON'T KNOW. THAT
MAKES THIS YOUR PARTY.
OPEN UP! POLICE!
WHY, YOU
TWO-TIMING--
TAKE HIM, BOB.
NORA.
NORA.
NORA. SAY, GIVE ME
THAT BOTTLE, WILL YOU?
WHAT KNOCKED HER OUT?
I DID. SHE WAS
IN THE LINE OF FIRE.
SOMEBODY CALL
A DOCTOR, WILL YOU?
HERE, BABY.
HELP ME UP
ON THE BED WITH HER.
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
YOU DARN FOOL!
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO
KNOCK ME OUT.
I KNEW YOU'D TAKE HIM.
I WANTED TO SEE YOU DO IT.
THERE'S A GIRL
WITH HAIR ON HER CHEST.
NICKY, ARE YOU HURT?
NO. HE JUST
GRAZED ME.
YOU ARE!
SOMEBODY GET A DOCTOR.
THERE'S ONE
CALLED ALREADY.
GET INTO BED.
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
SURE. I CAN'T
EVEN FEEL IT.
I'LL GET
SOME TOWELS.
HMM.
PRETTY CLOSE.
HAVE A SHOT,
WILL YOU?
HERE YOU ARE,
BUT YOU'LL BE OK.
TOUGH LUCK.
AW, SHUT UP!
HERE, DARLING.
USE THIS.
BABY, IT'S
ONLY A SCRATCH.
WANT A DRINK?
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
HOW DID YOU PEOPLE
HAPPEN TO POP IN HERE?
WE HEAR THIS IS A MEETING PLACE
FOR THE WYNANT FAMILY.
WE FIGURE
WE'LL STICK AROUND
IN CASE THE OLD BOY
HIMSELF SHOULD SHOW UP.
THEN WE SEE
THIS BIRD SNEAK IN,
AND WE DECIDE
TO COME UP.
LUCKY FOR YOU
WE DID.
YES. I MIGHT NOT
HAVE BEEN SHOT.
YOU KNOW THIS MONKEY?
THAT DIRTY
LITTLE RAT NUNHEIM--
SHUT UP!
IS HE A FRIEND
OF YOURS?
I NEVER SAW HIM
BEFORE.
WHAT DID HE WANT
WITH YOU?
HE WANTED TO TELL ME HE
DIDN'T KILL JULIA WOLF.
WHAT'S THAT TO YOU?
NOTHING.
WHAT DID HE THINK
IT WAS TO YOU?
ASK HIM.
I'M ASKING YOU.
KEEP ON ASKING.
FRISK THE DUMP.
NOT WITHOUT
A WARRANT.
SO YOU SAY.
GO ON, BOB.
TOUGH, HUH?
CHARLES,
WE'RE BOTH OF US
GOING ABOUT THIS THING
IN THE WRONG WAY.
I DON'T WANT
TO GET TOUGH WITH YOU,
AND I'M SURE YOU DON'T
WANT TO GET TOUGH WITH ME.
THERE'S ONE MORE QUESTION
I WANT TO ASK YOU.
ARE YOU WILLING TO SWEAR
TO A COMPLAINT
FOR THIS GUY'S
PLUGGING YOU?
THAT'S ANOTHER ONE
I CAN'T ANSWER NOW.
MAYBE IT WAS
AN ACCIDENT.
WHAT'S THAT MAN DOING
IN MY DRAWERS?
HERE YOU ARE,
LIEUTENANT.
YOU GOT
A PISTOL PERMIT?
NO.
EVER HEARD
OF THE SULLIVAN ACT?
OH, THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
WE'RE MARRIED.
THIS GUN YOURS?
NO.
WHOSE IS IT?
I'LL HAVE TO TRY
TO REMEMBER.
OK. WE GOT
PLENTY OF TIME.
I GUESS I'LL
HAVE TO ASK YOU
A LOT MORE QUESTIONS
THAN I FIGURED.
WE'LL COME AROUND TOMORROW
WHEN YOU'RE FEELING BETTER.
ALL RIGHT.
COME ON, BOYS.
SAY, WHERE'S ASTA?
ASTA? AS--
ASTA, COME HERE.
HA! YOU'RE
A FINE WATCHDOG.
HE'S GOT MORE SENSE
THAN YOU HAVE.
I'M GLAD YOU'RE
NOT ON THIS CASE.
ON IT? I'M IN IT.
THEY THINK I DID IT.
WELL, DIDN'T YOU?
AH...
WELL...
I HOPE YOU'RE SATISFIED.
HUH?
WHERE AM I?
YOU'RE NOT
IN A SHOOTING GALLERY.
AH, BUT, SUGAR,
THIS IS THE NICEST CHRISTMAS
PRESENT I'VE EVER HAD.
YOU ACT
AS THOUGH IT WERE
THE ONLY CHRISTMAS PRESENT
YOU EVER HAD.
SAY, WHERE DID YOU GET
THAT WRIST WATCH?
IT'S A CHRISTMAS PRESENT.
YEAH?
WHO GAVE IT TO YOU?
YOU DID.
WELL, YOU MUST ADMIT
I'VE GOT PRETTY
GOOD TASTE, HAVEN'T I?
YOU FINISHED WITH THIS?
YES. I KNOW AS MUCH ABOUT
THE MURDER AS THEY DO.
OH, I'M A HERO.
I WAS SHOT TWICE
IN THE TRIBUNE.
I READ WHERE YOU WERE SHOT
FIVE TIMES IN THE TABLOIDS.
IT'S NOT TRUE.
HE DIDN'T COME ANYWHERE
NEAR MY TABLOIDS.
AH! BULL'S-EYE.
HELLO? WHO IS IT?
OH, SEND HIM RIGHT UP.
WHO WAS THAT?
MR. MacCAULAY.
THE MALLORYS.
OH, DEAR. I FORGOT
ALL ABOUT THEM.
AREN'T YOU HOT
IN THAT?
YES, I'M STIFLING,
BUT IT'S SO PRETTY.
THE KIRBYS.
IS THAT ANOTHER
CHRISTMAS PRESENT?
MM-HMM.
DID I GIVE IT
TO YOU?
YES.
I'M SPOILING YOU.
WHY, NICKY,
THIS IS FROM CLYDE WYNANT.
HE SAYS,
"WILL YOU TAKE CHARGE
"OF INVESTIGATION
ON JULIA WOLF MURDER?
COMMUNICATE
WITH HERBERT MacCAULAY."
LET ME SEE.
WHERE'S IT FROM?
PHILADELPHIA.
THEN HE DIDN'T DO IT.
I DON'T KNOW.
HE WOULDN'T ASK YOU
TO HANDLE IT
IF HE WERE GUILTY,
WOULD HE?
YOUR GUESS IS
AS GOOD AS MINE, BABY.
AW, NICKY,
TAKE THE CASE.
YOU TAKE IT.
I'M TOO BUSY.
HOW DO YOU DO?
COME IN.
GOOD MORNING.
WELL, I'M AFRAID
THIS ISN'T A VERY
MERRY CHRISTMAS FOR YOU.
OH,
HE'S ALL RIGHT.
HOW ARE YOU,
MacCAULAY?
OH, I'M FINE. YOU'RE COMING
ALONG BETTER THAN I AM.
I HOPE YOU'RE
NOT SERIOUSLY HURT.
NO. JUST A SCRATCH.
I'VE FORGOTTEN IT.
WHAT
A DELIGHTFUL TOY.
THAT'S ASTA'S
CHRISTMAS PRESENT.
I GOT WORD FROM WYNANT
THIS MORNING.
SO DID WE--
I MEAN, SHERLOCK HERE.
DARLING,
WILL YOU, UH...
PASS YOU YOUR DRINK?
YES.
HMM.
THANK YOU.
WHAT ARE THE CHANCES
OF GETTING YOU
TO DO WHAT HE WANTS?
SLIM.
WOULD IT HELP ANY
IF I COULD PERSUADE
HIM TO MEET YOU?
IT MIGHT.
HE GAVE ME A CODE MESSAGE
TO INSERT IN THE TIMES
IN CASE I WANTED
TO GET IN TOUCH WITH HIM.
I DON'T SUPPOSE IT WOULD
DO ANY HARM TO PUT IT IN.
I'VE DONE THAT ALREADY.
HE SHOULD APPEAR.
IT DOESN'T LOOK WELL,
HIS STAYING AWAY NOW.
POLICE.
FOR ME?
HELLO?
WHERE?
ALLENTOWN?
YES.
WELL, WHEN IS
THE NEXT TRAIN?
RIGHT.
I'LL GET THAT.
WYNANT'S TRIED
TO COMMIT SUICIDE.
THEY WANT ME TO GO DOWN
AND IDENTIFY HIM.
WELL, I GUESS THIS
CHANGES THE WHOLE STORY,
DOESN'T IT?
THAT LOOKS LIKE
AN ADMISSION OF GUILT.
AND I HAD SUCH HOPES.
I THOUGHT IF YOU
GOT ON THE CASE,
YOU'D BE ABLE
TO CLEAR HIM.
I THOUGHT THAT MIMI--
THE WAY SHE ACTED,
I WAS SURE THAT...
OH, WELL.
WELL, THERE'S NO USE
THINKING ABOUT THAT NOW.
I'M SORRY TO HAVE WASTED
SO MUCH OF YOUR TIME.
GOOD-BYE.
HAVE A MERRY CHRISTMAS.
THANK YOU. SAME
TO YOU. GOOD-BYE.
ASTA,
IS YOUR BALLOON BUSTED?
SO IS MINE.
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU?
THE MYSTERY'S
ALL GONE.
I WAS HOPING YOU'D
FIND OUT WHO DID IT.
MAYBE I WILL.
WELL, WYNANT--
I DON'T BELIEVE
HE DID IT.
WHY DON'T YOU?
NO REASON.
JUST A HUNCH.
BUT I'M GOING
TO FIND OUT.
I'M TIRED OF BEING
PUSHED AROUND.
COME ON, DR. WATSON.
LET'S GO PLACES.
GOOD MORNING,
NICK.
WELL, IT'S NOT
A VERY NICE TRICK
YOU'RE TRYING
TO PULL ON ME,
RUNNING OUT LIKE THIS
WHEN I WAS GIVING YOU
TIME TO REST UP
BEFORE I ASKED YOU
THOSE QUESTIONS.
ABOUT THE GUN?
THAT NEVER WAS A GUN.
DON'T WASTE TIME
TALKING ABOUT THAT.
MAN TO MAN, ARE YOU
WORKING ON THIS CASE?
MAN TO MAN,
I'M NOT.
BUT HE'S
INTERESTED.
I'D RATHER HAVE YOU WORKING
WITH US THAN AGAINST US.
THAT SUITS ME.
IT'S A BARGAIN.
ANYTHING YOU WANT TO KNOW?
WHAT ABOUT THE SUICIDE?
A PHONY. THE BOYS DIDN'T
EVEN HAVE TO GO DOWN.
I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE.
THEY'RE GOING TO THINK
EVERY THIN MAN
WITH WHITE HAIR IS WYNANT.
YOU THINK
WYNANT DID IT?
I DON'T KNOW. HE CERTAINLY
PLANNED SOMETHING.
HE CLOSED UP
HIS APARTMENT AND SHOP.
WERE YOU THERE?
YES, BUT I COULDN'T
FIND A THING.
I FIGURE WYNANT WENT
TO JULIA'S APARTMENT
AND FOUND MORELLI THERE,
SEES SHE'S TWO-TIMING HIM.
THERE'S A FIGHT.
HE DOESN'T PULL ANYTHING THEN
ON ACCOUNT OF MORELLI.
LETS HIS LAWYER GIVE HER MONEY
TO GIVE TO HIM
SO THAT SHE'LL THINK
IT'S ALL BLOWN OVER.
WHEN SHE ISN'T EXPECTING IT,
HE LETS HER HAVE IT.
NO PROOF?
NO, NOTHING AS YET
TO CINCH IT.
HE DIDN'T DO IT.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
HE WAS TOO ABSENT-MINDED
TO HOLD A GRUDGE.
WHO'S YOUR CANDIDATE?
I HAVEN'T GOTTEN
THAT FAR YET,
BUT I DON'T THINK THAT
EVERYTHING POINTS TO WYNANT.
WHAT ABOUT YOUR ALIBIS?
THEY'RE ALL OK--
MRS. JORGENSON, THE BOY,
DOROTHY, MacCAULAY,
EVEN MORELLI.
WE HAD TO LET HIM GO.
WHAT ABOUT JORGENSON?
I'LL CHECK ON THAT.
MRS. CHARLES, THIS
MUST BE DULL FOR YOU.
DULL? I'M ON THE
EDGE OF MY CHAIR.
WHAT ABOUT NUNHEIM?
HE'S ALL RIGHT.
WE KNOW ALL ABOUT HIM.
HE DOES A LITTLE STOOLING
FOR US ONCE IN A WHILE.
DID YOU KNOW THAT HE'D BEEN
HANGING AROUND JULIA?
NO.
HOLDING OUT ON YOU.
LET'S LOOK INTO THAT.
TAXI!
THIS MAY GET A BIT
ROUGH, BABY.
I THINK YOU BETTER
LET US GO ALONE.
CATCH ME LETTING
YOU GO ALONE.
GRANT'S TOMB.
TAXI!
WHO IS IT?
JOHN.
HELLO, LIEUTENANT.
SIT DOWN, NICK.
I WASN'T EXPECTING YOU,
LIEUTENANT.
YOU SAID YOU'D PHONE.
HAVE A SHOT?
WHAT'S THE IDEA
TELLING ME
YOU KNEW THE WOLF GIRL
JUST BY SIGHT?
THAT'S ALL I DID,
LIEUTENANT.
THAT'S
THE GOD'S TRUTH.
MAYBE I SAID HELLO TO
HER OR "HOW ARE YOU?"
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
WHEN I SAW HER,
BUT THAT'S ALL I DID.
THAT'S THE TRUTH.
HA HA HA! HMPH!
YOU OPEN YOUR MOUTH,
AND I'LL POP
A TOOTH OUT OF IT.
OH, IS THAT SO?
YEAH!
CUT IT OUT.
CUT IT OUT!
WE DIDN'T COME HERE TO
WATCH YOU TWO ROUGHHOUSE.
SHE'S DRIVING ME NUTS.
SHE'S BEEN
RAGGING ME ALL DAY.
MAYBE IF YOU QUIT RUNNING
AROUND AFTER OTHER WOMEN,
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE SO MUCH
TROUBLE WITH THIS ONE.
NOW, THAT'S A LIE,
LIEUTENANT.
ANYBODY THAT SAYS THAT
IS A LIAR.
WANT TO TAKE
A POKE AT HIM?
I DIDN'T MEAN YOU,
MISTER.
COME ON. SHE CAN'T
HEAR YOU NOW.
YOU KNOW HOW IT IS,
A GUY KNOCKING AROUND.
YOU'D HAVE DONE BETTER
TO HAVE TOLD ME THAT
IN THE BEGINNING.
WHERE WERE YOU
THE AFTERNOON SHE
WAS KNOCKED OFF?
YOU DON'T THINK I HAD
ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT!
WHERE WERE YOU?
MARION!
WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT A MINUTE.
I DON'T LIKE CROOKS,
AND IF I DID LIKE THEM,
I WOULDN'T LIKE CROOKS
THAT ARE STOOL PIGEONS,
AND IF I DID LIKE
CROOKS THAT ARE STOOL PIGEONS,
I STILL WOULDN'T
LIKE YOU!
MARION, DON'T GO!
MARION! MARION,
WAIT A MINUTE!
I'LL DO ANYTHING YOU SAY.
I'LL BEHAVE! DON'T GO.
LET ME GET AFTER HER.
LET ME BRING HER BACK.
I'LL DO ANYTHING.
I'LL ANSWER ANYTHING
YOU WANT.
SIT DOWN.
WE DIDN'T COME HERE
TO WATCH YOU TWO DANCE
AROUND THE MAYPOLE.
WHERE WERE YOU THE AFTERNOON
THAT GIRL WAS KILLED?
I DON'T KNOW.
I CAN'T REMEMBER.
I CAN'T TELL YOU
JUST OFFHAND.
MAYBE I WAS DOWN AT
CHARLIE'S SHOOTING POOL.
MAYBE I WAS UP HERE.
I DON'T KNOW.
SHE'D REMEMBER.
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE
TO BE THROWN IN THE CAN
ON ACCOUNT
OF NOT REMEMBERING?
GIVE ME A MINUTE.
I'LL REMEMBER.
YOU KNOW I AIN'T STALLING.
ALWAYS COME CLEAN WITH YOU.
GEE. GEE, SURE.
SURE.
I--I REMEMBER.
I WOULDN'T BLAME YOU
IF YOU THREW ME IN THE CAN.
LOOK, I REMEMBER
WHERE I WAS.
THAT--THAT'S THE AFTERNOON--
WAIT A MINUTE.
I'LL SHOW YOU.
WELL, WHAT DO YOU
THINK OF IT?
WELL, I THINK WE'RE
ON THE RIGHT TRACK.
WHO ARE YOU PHONING?
I'M PHONING
YOUR OFFICE
SO THEY CAN SEND OUT
A MAN TO TRAIL HIM.
I WANT TO SEE
WHERE HE GOES.
TRAIL HIM?
TRAIL WHO?
NUNHEIM.
GIVE ME THAT PHONE.
GIVE ME THAT PHONE.
BILL, PICK UP NUNHEIM.
TELL THE BOYS.
HE JUST LEFT HERE--
WENT DOWN THE FIRE ESCAPE.
COVER THE GRAND CENTRAL
AND PENNSYLVANIA STATIONS.
CHECK ALL AIRPORTS
AND ALL STEAMSHIP TERMINALS.
WHAT'S THAT? NO.
HAVE LEFTY RADIO ALL THE CARS.
HE WAS DRESSED
IN A BLACK PAIR OF PANTS.
HOW SHOULD I KNOW IF
HIS UNDERWEAR'S EMBROIDERED?
LISTEN, THEY'VE BEEN
QUESTIONING ME AGAIN TODAY, SEE,
ASKING ME WHAT MORE I KNOW,
WHERE I WAS THAT DAY.
WAIT A MINUTE.
I DUCKED OUT ON THEM.
LOOK, IF YOU WANT ME
TO PLAY DUMB ANYMORE,
I WANT 5,000 MORE.
BLOW TOWN TODAY.
OK. WHERE?
ALL RIGHT. RIGHT AWAY.
SEE THAT YOU'RE THERE
AND SEE THAT
YOU BRING IT WITH YOU.
AAH!
"ARTHUR NUNHEIM,
HONORARY MEMBER."
NOPE, NOT A THING.
FIND OUT ABOUT
THAT BULLET YET?
YES. IT'S THE SAME GUN
THAT KILLED JULIA WOLF.
AND HOW ARE
YOUR FOLKS?
HELLO?
OH, HOW ARE YOU?
NO, WE DIDN'T
FIND A THING.
YOUR WIFE.
AND, LIEUTENANT,
I'VE GOT SOMETHING.
I'VE BEEN DOING A LITTLE
DETECTING ON MY OWN.
THAT FLATFOOT I MARRIED
THINKS HE'S SMART,
BUT I'M JUST ONE JUMP
AHEAD OF HIM.
THAT'S SWELL, MRS. CHARLES.
HOW DID YOU
LIKE GRANT'S TOMB?
IT'S LOVELY. I'M HAVING
A COPY MADE FOR YOU.
WHAT HAVE
YOU GOT, BABY?
I CAN'T QUITE
HEAR YOU.
OH. WE'LL BE
RIGHT UP.
SHE'S UP AT MIMI'S.
JORGENSON
HAS DISAPPEARED.
CHRIS MAY BE AT THE CLUB.
THAT'S NOT IMPORTANT.
YOU SHOULD HAVE TOLD THEM
THAT HE DISAPPEARED.
BUT HE HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH IT.
THAT'S NOT FOR YOU
TO DECIDE.
EVERYBODY'S
UNDER SUSPICION,
ESPECIALLY
RUNNING OFF LIKE THIS.
THE POLICE ARE GOING TO
WANT A DESCRIPTION OF HIM.
IS THIS HIS PICTURE?
HE DIDN'T DO IT!
THEY'LL WANT MORE
THAN YOUR WORD.
I'LL TELL THEM
WHO DID DO IT,
AND I'LL
GIVE THEM PROOF.
DORIE.
OH, TOMMY.
PLEASE DON'T CRY.
I CAN'T HELP IT.
YOU DON'T KNOW.
DARLING, YOU CAN'T GO
THROUGH ANY MORE OF THIS.
YOU GET TOGETHER SOME
CLOTHES AND YOUR SKATES,
AND WE'LL GO TO MY FAMILY
IN THE COUNTRY.
NO, I CAN'T.
YOU'VE GOT TO GET
YOUR MIND OFF ALL THIS.
DARLING, YOU'VE
BEEN SO SWEET,
BUT THERE'S ONLY ONE THING
YOU COULD DO FOR ME,
AND THAT IS TO GO
AND NEVER SEE ME AGAIN.
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?
PLEASE, YOU CAN'T GET
MIXED UP IN THIS.
DO YOU THINK
I CARE ABOUT THAT?
TOMMY,
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.
ALL I KNOW IS
I WANT YOU TO MARRY ME.
I CAN'T MARRY YOU.
I CAN'T EVER MARRY YOU.
DOROTHY!
WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE
MURDERERS FOR CHILDREN?
THAT WOULD BE FUN,
WOULDN'T IT?
PERHAPS THEY'D ALL
MURDER EACH OTHER
AND KEEP IT
IN THE FAMILY.
THAT'S WHAT FATHER
SHOULD HAVE DONE.
HE SHOULD HAVE KILLED
GILBERT AND ME.
THEN WE WOULDN'T HAVE
HAD THIS TO GO THROUGH.
YOU'RE TALKING
LIKE A CRAZY PERSON.
WHY NOT? I AM CRAZY.
ALL OUR FAMILY'S CRAZY.
DOROTHY, I LOVE YOU.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?
TOMMY! TOMMY!
PLEASE GO. GO.
SLEUTHING ISN'T MUCH FUN
AFTER ALL, IS IT?
I FEEL AWFULLY SORRY
FOR THAT GIRL.
FIND ANYTHING?
SHE'S READY TO TALK.
WOULDN'T DO ANY HARM,
THOUGH,
TO FIND OUT
WHERE HE IS.
YOU'RE WRONG ABOUT ALL YOUR
CHILDREN BEING MURDERERS.
NOW, I'VE STUDIED THE
MENDELIAN LAW OF INHERITANCE
AND THEIR EXPERIMENTS
WITH SWEET PEAS,
AND ACCORDING
TO THEIR FINDINGS--
AND THEY'VE BEEN
PRETTY CONCLUSIVE--
ONLY ONE OUT OF FOUR
OF YOUR CHILDREN
WILL BE A MURDERER.
THE THING FOR YOU TO DO
WOULD BE JUST
TO HAVE THREE CHILDREN.
NO, THAT MIGHT NOT WORK.
THE FIRST ONE
MIGHT BE THE BAD ONE.
I'LL HAVE TO
LOOK THAT UP.
YOU NEEDN'T BOTHER
ABOUT LOOKING THAT UP.
I'M NOT GETTING MARRIED,
I'M NOT HAVING ANY CHILDREN.
FROM NOW ON, I'M JUST
OUT FOR THE RIDE.
I TOOK IT FROM HER HAND.
IT WAS MR. WYNANT'S
WATCH CHAIN.
I WANTED TO PROTECT HIM.
WELL, I GUESS THAT
CINCHES IT, EH, CHARLES?
HE KILLED
THEM BOTH--
THE WOLF GIRL
AND NUNHEIM.
GET YOU 100.
THAT'S ENOUGH
FOR ME.
EXTRA! WYNANT'S EX-WIFE
PRODUCES MURDER EVIDENCE!
EXTRA! EXTRA!
DOUBLE MURDER CHARGE
AGAINST WYNANT!
EXTRA! EXTRA!
WYNANT WANTED
IN SECOND MURDER!
EXTRA!
I WISH THEY'D
STOP THAT.
I WONDER IF
THEY'LL FIND HIM.
HE MUST BE
IN NEW YORK.
WHERE DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE GOING?
I'M A-GONNA TAKE
ASTA FOR A WALK.
HE'S JUST BEEN.
WELL, WE'RE GOING
SIGHTSEEING.
WHAT'S THAT?
THAT'S KNOWN IN BURGLING
CIRCLES AS A FLASHLIGHT.
NICK, WHAT ARE YOU
UP TO? WHAT IS THIS?
OOH! LOOKS LIKE
A HOLDUP.
WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO?
I'M GOING TO FIND OUT
WHY WYNANT'S SHOP IS CLOSED.
HE WENT AWAY,
DIDN'T HE?
HE WENT AWAY A LOT
WHEN I KNEW HIM,
BUT HE NEVER
CLOSED THE SHOP.
I GOT A HUNCH.
DO YOU THINK
HE'S HIDING THERE?
I DON'T KNOW,
BUT I'M GOING TO FIND OUT.
I WON'T HAVE YOU
GOING DOWN THERE.
HEY, YOU GOT ME
INTO THIS.
I KNOW, BUT HE'S
A CRAZY MAN.
HE MIGHT KILL YOU.
HE WON'T KILL ME.
I'VE GOT ASTA
TO PROTECT ME.
ALL RIGHT. GO AHEAD.
SEE IF I CARE.
I THINK
IT'S A DIRTY TRICK
TO BRING ME
TO NEW YORK
TO MAKE
A WIDOW OF ME.
YOU WOULDN'T BE
A WIDOW LONG...
YOU BET I WOULDN'T.
NOT WITH
ALL YOUR MONEY.
WELL, ANY PORT
IN A STORM.
GOOD-BYE, SUGAR.
NICKY!
NICKY!
HUH?
TAKE CARE
OF YOURSELF.
OH, SURE I WILL.
SAY IT AS IF
YOU MEANT IT.
WELL, I DO BELIEVE
THE LITTLE WOMAN CARES.
I DON'T CARE.
IT'S JUST THAT I'M USED
TO YOU, THAT'S ALL.
IF YOU LET ANYTHING
HAPPEN TO HIM,
YOU'LL NEVER WAG
THAT TAIL AGAIN.
YOU SURE
THIS IS THE PLACE?
YEAH.
YOU DON'T WANT ME
TO WAIT, DO YOU?
CERTAINLY.
NOT AFRAID, ARE YOU?
NO, I GUESS NOT.
ALL RIGHT, ASTA.
ASTA?
COME ON, ASTA.
ASTA?
ASTA, YOU'RE NOT A TERRIER.
YOU'RE A POLICE DOG.
WHEW!
NO, ASTA. NO, NO.
ASTA, GET AWAY
FROM THERE.
COME ON.
COME ON.
COME ON.
HELLO. LIEUTENANT GUILD,
PLEASE.
OH, JOHN?
THIS IS NICK CHARLES.
I'M UP IN WYNANT'S SHOP.
WELL, I FOUND SOMETHING.
IT'S A BODY.
STICK 'EM UP!
TURN AROUND.
DON'T MAKE A MOVE,
OR THAT DOG WILL
TEAR YOU TO SHREDS.
YOU CAN COME OUT.
HE WON'T HURT YOU.
UP TO YOUR
OLD TRICKS, TANNER?
YOU'RE MR. CHARLES,
AREN'T YOU, SIR?
YES. HOW DID YOU
GET IN?
I HAVE A KEY. I WORKED HERE,
TILL THEY CLOSED IT.
YOU WORKED HERE?
YES. JULIA WOLF GOT ME
A BOOKKEEPER JOB.
WELL,
THAT'S A HOT ONE.
WHERE DID YOU EVER
LEARN BOOKKEEPING?
THAT LAST TIME
YOU SENT ME UP,
I LEARNED BOOKKEEPING
IN SING SING.
I FIGURED IT WOULD BE
AN IN FOR ME SOMEWHERES.
SOMEWHERES WHERE THEY MIGHT
LEAVE THE SAFE OPEN.
HONEST, MR. CHARLES,
I NEVER TOUCHED THAT SAFE.
THEM BONDS THAT WAS MISSING--
JULIA WOLF TOOK THEM.
TRYING TO PUT IT OFF
ON HER, HUH?
SHE DID. THAT'S WHY HE GOT
SORE AT HER AND KILLED HER.
LISTEN, CAN I TAKE
MY HANDS DOWN?
OK.
I DID DO
A BIT OF CHISELING.
I COME TO BRING
THE MONEY BACK
AND FIX UP THE BOOKS.
EASY!
IT'S ALL RIGHT,
MR. CHARLES.
IT'S JUST A POCKETBOOK.
I DIDN'T WANT HIM
TO FIND OUT
AND COME AFTER ME.
SAVE THAT. TELL IT
TO THE POLICE.
POLICE?
MOVE OVER,
WILL YOU?
HAVEN'T YOU
GOT THAT YET?
YOU WOULDN'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT THIS,
WOULD YOU?
NO, SIR.
TAKE HIM
DOWN TO CENTRAL.
I'LL TALK
TO HIM LATER.
HMM. WONDER WHAT WYNANT
HAD AGAINST THIS ONE.
QUICKLIME.
MIND IF I
LOOK THESE OVER, DOC?
NO. GO AHEAD.
JUST ROLLED THEM
UP AND THREW THEM IN.
LUCKY THING FOR US THESE
WEREN'T ENTIRELY EATEN UP.
EXTRAORDINARILY
LUCKY.
NO IDENTIFICATION.
MUST HAVE WEIGHED
HERE'S SOMETHING.
HMM. RUBBER TIP.
MUST HAVE BEEN LAME.
WHO WOULDN'T BE,
CARRYING ALL THAT
WEIGHT AROUND?
I SHOULD SAY HE STOOD
ABOUT 5'11",
WOULDN'T YOU, DOC?
YEAH, ABOUT.
"D.W.R."
"R."
SAY, THAT CASE
YOU WORKED ON,
THAT MAN WHO THREATENED
TO KILL WYNANT--
WHAT WAS HIS NAME?
ROSEBREEN.
SAY, COULD THIS
BE THE MAN?
I NEVER SAW HIM.
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY
EVER SAW HIM.
HE THREATENED
TO KILL WYNANT
ON ACCOUNT OF SOME INVENTION
HE'D STOLEN, RIGHT?
YES. WE FIGURED THAT
WAS JUST BLACKMAIL.
HE STILL WOULDN'T MIND
GETTING RID OF HIM, WOULD HE?
DOC, HOW LONG WOULD YOU SAY
THIS BODY HAD BEEN HERE?
CAN'T SAY OFFHAND.
AT LEAST A COUPLE
OF MONTHS.
A COUPLE OF MONTHS?
THAT'S JUST WHEN WYNANT
CLOSED THE SHOP!
IT'S AN OPEN BOOK.
WYNANT KILLED THIS GUY
AND PLANTED HIM HERE.
JULIA KNEW ABOUT IT,
SO HE KILLED HER,
AND NUNHEIM
CAUGHT HIM AT THAT,
SO HE BUMPED HIM OFF.
WELL, BOYS, I GUESS
WE'LL BE GOING.
NICK, YOU DID
A SWELL JOB.
YOU WOULDN'T MIND PAYING ME
THAT $100 NOW, WOULD YOU?
WAIT TILL YOU
CATCH WYNANT.
HA HA! I'LL GET HIM,
ALL RIGHT!
BRING THAT STUFF
OUT TO THE CAR.
YOU GOING TO RUN HIM
THROUGH THE
POLARISCOPE?
YES.
YOU MIND IF
I COME SEE IT?
I'M VERY INTERESTED
IN THAT BODY.
STEP RIGHT OVER HERE,
MR. CHARLES.
THERE'S THE BULLET
HE WAS KILLED WITH. SEE?
HMM.
OOH...
WHAT'S THAT?
OH, JUST AN OLD
PIECE OF SHRAPNEL.
SHRAPNEL, HUH?
MMM. WELL, MAYBE
HE WAS IN THE WAR.
THAT WOULD ACCOUNT FOR
HIS CANE AND HIS LIMP.
YES. YES.
EXTRA! EXTRA!
READ ALL ABOUT THE FINDING
OF THE BODY!
EXTRA! EXTRA!
READ ALL ABOUT IT!
HEY, DOGGY.
COME ON.
LOOK DOWN AT THE
FLOOR, AT THE BODY.
MR. CHARLES,
THIS WAY.
GET THAT
OUT OF HERE!
JUST A MOMENT. MRS. CHARLES,
ONE FAMILY GROUP.
FOR THE WOMAN'S PAGE.
DO THE POLICE KNOW
WHERE WYNANT IS?
NO.
DO YOU THINK
THEY'LL FIND HIM?
I KNOW THEY WILL.
GOT ANYTHING
ELSE TO SAY?
NO.
WHAT ABOUT
THIS ROSEBREEN?
I DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT IT.
CAN'T YOU TELL US
ANYTHING ABOUT THE CASE?
YES. IT'S PUTTING ME
BEHIND IN MY DRINKING.
LET'S GET THIS IN.
WHAT'S YOUR
NEXT STEP, NICK?
BACK TO CALIFORNIA
TO REST UP FROM THIS VACATION.
WE'LL SEE YOU
BEFORE YOU GO.
GOOD-BYE, BOYS.
GOOD-BYE.
BACK TO CALIFORNIA,
HUH?
MY SOUL, WOMAN.
I GIVE YOU
THREE MURDERS,
AND YOU'RE STILL
NOT SATISFIED.
OH!
WELL, IF YOU INSIST.
WELL, I DON'T INSIST.
NO, I WANTED YOU
TO STAY HERE
AND FIND WYNANT.
I DID FIND HIM.
HE WAS DOWN
IN HIS SHOP.
NICK!
THAT WAS HIS BODY
THAT WAS DOWN THERE.
DARLING, YOU'D BETTER
LAY OFF THAT LIQUOR.
WELL, THAT'S A FACT.
WYNANT'S BODY?
YEP.
SAY, DON'T YOU WANT
SOMETHING TO EAT?
EVERYBODY THOUGHT
IT WAS ROSEBREEN.
THAT'S WHAT
THEY THINK--
GUILD AND THE REST
OF THEM.
THEY TAKE IT
FOR GRANTED
IT WAS ANOTHER ONE
OF WYNANT'S VICTIMS.
GUILD'S OUT
LOOKING FOR WYNANT.
THAT'S ALL
THAT TROUBLES HIM.
WHAT MAKES YOU SO SURE
IT WAS WYNANT'S BODY?
WELL...
SEVERAL THINGS.
OH, HELLO. FRED?
WE'RE HUNGRY AGAIN.
HA HA!
AND LOTS OF ONIONS.
OH, AND, UH, COFFEE.
YOU'RE DRIVING ME CRAZY.
WHAT THINGS?
HMM?
WHAT THINGS
MAKE YOU SO SURE?
OH! WELL, TAKE THE
CLOTHES, FOR INSTANCE.
THEY WERE VERY
CAREFULLY PRESERVED,
AND THE BODY WAS
JUST AS CAREFULLY
DESTROYED.
WHOEVER KILLED HIM WAS
COUNTING ON ONE THING--
THAT SKELETONS
ALL LOOK ALIKE.
WELL, THEY DO,
DON'T THEY?
SURE.
YOU'RE NOT GETTING ANOTHER
SWALLOW UNTIL YOU OPEN UP.
I REMEMBER THAT WYNANT
HAD SHRAPNEL IN HIS SHIN.
IT USED TO BOTHER HIM.
I LOOKED FOR IT
AND FOUND IT.
HOW LONG
HAS HE BEEN DEAD?
A COUPLE OF MONTHS.
OH, THEN HE COULDN'T HAVE
COMMITTED THOSE MURDERS.
SMART GAL.
WYNANT DEAD.
DOES DOROTHY KNOW?
NO. NOBODY KNOWS
BUT YOU.
I'M GOING TO
TELL HER.
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.
SHE'S GOING CRAZY.
SHE'D RATHER KNOW
HE WAS DEAD THAN--
I CAN'T TELL ANYONE.
I HAVEN'T TOLD GUILD.
WHY?
I'M LYING LOW
UNTIL I GET THE DOPE.
I WON'T GO OFF
HALF-COCKED.
WHAT WILL YOU DO?
I'M GOING TO GET
THE MURDERER,
AND I'VE GOT AN IDEA.
YOU WANT TO SEE ME
TAKE HIM?
YES.
HAVE YOU GOT
A NICE EVENING GOWN?
WHAT'S THAT
GOT TO DO WITH IT?
HAVE YOU GOT
A NICE EVENING GOWN?
YES, I'VE GOT
A LULU. WHY?
I'M GOING TO GIVE A PARTY
AND INVITE ALL THE SUSPECTS.
SUSPECTS?
THEY WON'T COME.
OH, YES, THEY WILL.
I'LL GET GUILD TO ISSUE
THE INVITATIONS.
WHO DO YOU THINK
DID IT?
MIMI.
MIMI?
MIMI, JORGENSON,
MORELLI, TANNER.
WHAT WERE YOU DOING
ON THE NIGHT
OF OCTOBER 5, 1902?
I WAS JUST A GLEAM
IN MY FATHER'S EYE.
LET'S SEE.
YOU AT THE HEAD.
AND YOU ON MY RIGHT.
THANK YOU.
I'LL PUT MacCAULAY HERE.
HE CAN HELP ME.
OUGHT TO BE A LADY
NEXT TO HIM.
I'VE GOT MIMI.
I DON'T THINK
MIMI LIKES HIM.
THEN IT'S MIMI.
WHO GOES NEXT TO ME?
LEAVE THAT OPEN.
SEE WHAT YOU DRAW.
PUT DOROTHY THERE.
AND THEN TOMMY?
I'LL KEEP TOMMY ON THIS
SIDE. PUT GILBERT NEXT.
NICE BOY.
WHO'S NEXT TO GILBERT?
THAT BIRD
THAT SHOT ME.
MORELLI? THIS IS
GOING TO BE GOOD.
I'LL PUT MIMI'S
GIGOLO HUSBAND HERE.
HAVE THEY FOUND HIM?
THEY'VE FOUND HIM.
WHO GOES NEXT TO HIM?
I'M LEAVING
THAT OPEN.
I HAVE A FEELING
HE WON'T COME ALONE.
WHERE WILL YOU
PUT GUILD?
DOWN AT THE END,
WHERE HE CAN KEEP
AN EYE ON THINGS
WHEN THE TROUBLE
STARTS.
THAT LITTLE FRIEND
OF NUNHEIM'S,
THE FRYING-PAN
JUGGLER, THERE.
ARE YOU SURE ONE OF THESE
PEOPLE IS THE KILLER?
POSITIVE.
I CAN'T STAND
THE SUSPENSE.
WHICH ONE DID IT?
I WISH YOU'D TELL ME.
I WISH
YOU'D TELL ME.
MR. CHARLES.
THESE MEN WILL INTERFERE
WITH YOUR BEAUTIFUL DINNER.
HOW'S IT GOING, BOYS?
OH, SWELL.
NOW, HOW'S THIS?
YES, "MISSEUR."
MMM.
TERRIBLE.
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
YOUR MEN WILL SERVE
THE DINNER.
THESE BOYS ARE
JUST HERE IN CASE.
I THINK THEY'RE GOING
TO BE ALL RIGHT.
HELLO, MRS. CHARLES.
OH, HELLO, MR. GUILD.
I SEE
YOU'RE ALL SET.
DO YOU THINK
THEY'LL COME?
MOST OF THEM
ARE HERE ALREADY.
MY MEN ARE
PICKING UP THE REST.
BRING THEM IN, BOYS.
YOU'RE A GREAT HELP
TO A HOSTESS.
I WISH I HAD YOU
AT ALL MY DINNER PARTIES.
LET GO OF MY ARM,
YOU BIG LUG!
I AIN'T
DONE NOTHIN'.
OH, IT'S YOU, HUH?
WE ONLY WANTED YOU
TO DINE WITH US.
IF YOU THINK I'LL TALK,
YOU'RE CRAZY.
JUST 'CAUSE I WAS MIXED
UP WITH A STOOL PIGEON
DON'T MEAN I'M ONE, TOO.
ABSOLUTELY NOT.
SHOW THE LADY A CHAIR.
ON YOUR WAY, SISTER.
DID YOU FIND
DOROTHY?
NO, BUT
SHE'LL BE HERE.
WHAT YOU NEED
IS A DRINK.
I SHOULD THINK YOU GUYS
ARE TIRED OF PICKING ME UP.
STEP THIS WAY, KID.
WHAT'S UP?
IT'S OUTRAGEOUS!
HOW DO YOU DO,
MRS. JORGENSON?
HOW DARE YOU SEND
A DETECTIVE AFTER US?!
WE WANTED TO BE SURE
YOU'D GET HERE.
I TOLD HIM
WE COULDN'T COME.
WE'RE GOING
TO THE THEATER.
NICKY'S PUTTING ON
A LITTLE SHOW OF HIS OWN.
YOU MUST STAY.
PLEASE COME HAVE A COCKTAIL.
WHAT'S THE GAG?
YOU KNOW
AS MUCH AS I DO.
HAVE A COCKTAIL.
NO, THANKS.
I SAID
HAVE A COCKTAIL!
HE WANTS US
TO HAVE A COCKTAIL.
HI, MacCAULAY.
TAKE OFF
YOUR HAT AND COAT
AND JOIN
OUR FESTIVITIES.
OH, TANNER.
WHAT'S THIS?
THEY HAD ME IN JAIL
LAST NIGHT.
DON'T THINK
A THING OF IT.
TANNER,
TAKE OFF YOUR THINGS.
WHAT IS IT,
MR. CHARLES?
I've got
something, I think.
COME IN, TANNER.
WHERE'S DOROTHY?
I THOUGHT
SHE WAS WITH YOU.
SHE LEFT THE HOUSE
THIS AFTERNOON.
HERE SHE IS NOW.
WE PICKED THEM UP AT
THE PENNSYLVANIA STATION.
COME ON IN.
HELLO, NICK.
A PARTY, HUH?
YES.
CELEBRATING FATHER'S
THIRD MURDER?
THEY WERE TRYING TO
MAKE A GETAWAY.
WE WERE DOING
NOTHING OF THE SORT.
YOU CAN'T
GET AWAY WITH THIS.
HOW RIGHT YOU ARE.
TAKE THIS...GENTLEMAN'S
HAT AND COAT.
MUSIC. MUCH MUSIC.
NICK INTERRUPTED ME
AT A VERY IMPORTANT
TIME OF MY LIFE.
I WAS ABOUT TO TAKE
MY FIRST FALSE STEP.
I'M GETTING
OUT OF HERE.
NO. YOU STAY HERE.
IF I STAY, I KNOW I'M GOING
TO TAKE A POKE AT HIM.
THEN I INSIST
THAT YOU STAY.
HERE'S JORGENSON.
WHY, CHRIS!
HOW DO YOU DO?
I'M NICK CHARLES.
CHRIS, WHERE
HAVE YOU BEEN?
NONE
OF YOUR BUSINESS.
I SWEAR
IT ISN'T MY FAULT.
I TRIED TO KEEP YOU
OUT OF THIS.
TAKE YOUR HANDS
OFF HIM.
DO YOU HEAR ME?
CHRIS, WHAT DOES
THIS MEAN?
SORRY WE'RE LATE.
WE HAD TO BREAK DOWN
THE DOOR.
CHRIS,
HOW COULD YOU? OH!
DO COME IN AND MAKE
YOURSELVES COMFORTABLE.
TAKE THE GENTLEMAN'S
HAT AND COAT.
COME, FRIENDS,
AND GET IT.
TOMMY, WOULD YOU LIKE
TO BE END MAN?
MR. JORGENSON,
NEXT TO TOMMY.
DOROTHY, YOU
AND MR. QUINN ARE HERE.
MacCAULAY,
HERE, IF YOU WILL.
TANNER, DOWN THERE.
OH, MRS. JORGENSON,
NEXT TO MR. JORGENSON.
I'M MRS. JORGENSON!
PUT IT OVER THERE,
SISTER.
I WAS MRS. JORGENSON
BEFORE YOU WERE.
OH, MIMI,
UH...YOU'RE HERE.
OH, WAITER,
WILL YOU REMOVE
THE ILLUMINATION, PLEASE?
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
BE SEATED.
NOW, MY FRIENDS, IF I MAY
PROPOSE A LITTLE TOAST.
LET US EAT, DRINK,
AND BE MERRY,
FOR TOMORROW WE DIE.
YOU GIVE SUCH CHARMING PARTIES,
MR. CHARLES.
THANK YOU,
MRS. CHARLES.
PERHAPS YOU'LL
TELL US NOW
WHY WE'RE HERE.
WE'RE HERE BECAUSE I HAVE
SOME VERY IMPORTANT NEWS.
WHAT IS IT?
JUST THIS.
CLYDE WYNANT DID NOT KILL
JULIA, NUNHEIM, OR ANYONE.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
IT'S IN THE PAPERS.
HE DIDN'T
KILL THEM?
WHAT DID I
TELL YOU?
I'D LIKE TO
BELIEVE THAT.
I KNEW THEY'D
PULL SOMETHING.
IF YOU GOT MONEY,
YOU CAN GET BY
WITH ANYTHING.
QUIET!
LET HIM HAVE HIS SAY.
WHAT MAKES YOU
SAY THAT, NICK?
I SAW HIM LAST NIGHT.
WHERE?
THAT'S NOTHING.
I SAW HIM MYSELF.
I TOLD YOU.
IT'S A FRAME-UP.
WHEN DID YOU SEE HIM?
LAST NIGHT,
IN MY APARTMENT.
IS THAT SO?
WHAT DID HE SAY?
HE WANTED TO KNOW
HOW I WAS
AND HOW
THE CHILDREN WERE.
WHAT WAS HE WEARING?
UH, BROWN SUIT,
BROWN SHOES,
A WHITE SHIRT,
A GRAYISH TIE
WITH REDDISH-BROWN
OR BROWNISH-RED DOTS
IN IT.
TELL THE MEN.
I SAW HIM, TOO,
WEARING A GREEN SUIT.
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
YOU WEREN'T EVEN THERE.
I KNOW, BUT I SAW HIM.
WHERE?
I WAS GAZING
IN MY CRYSTAL.
OHH!
WAITER, WILL YOU
SERVE THE NUTS?
I MEAN, WILL YOU SERVE
THE GUESTS THE NUTS?
MIMI, I'M AFRAID
YOU'RE LYING.
I REALLY DID SEE
WYNANT LAST NIGHT.
ARE YOU KIDDING?
WHAT'S THE IDEA
OF HOLDING OUT ON ME?
YOU SAW HIM
YOURSELF.
THAT WAS
HIS BODY
BURIED
IN THE SHOP.
NICK!
DOROTHY, IT'S TERRIBLE
TO TELL YOU THIS WAY,
BUT YOUR FATHER
IS DEAD.
HE'S BEEN DEAD
THREE MONTHS.
I'M TERRIBLY--
YOU HAVE SOMETHING
ON YOUR COAT.
OH, DARLING,
PLEASE DON'T CRY.
IT'S TERRIBLE,
I KNOW,
BUT ISN'T IT
BETTER THAT WAY?
I'LL TAKE CARE
OF HER.
UH, TOMMY...
TOMMY,
YOU SIT HERE.
WAITER, WILL YOU
KINDLY REMOVE THAT?
WHAT? NO ONE EATING?
AH! MIMI, I SEE IT HASN'T
AFFECTED YOUR APPETITE.
BECAUSE I DON'T
BELIEVE A WORD OF IT.
WHAT'S YOUR PROOF?
A PIECE OF SHRAPNEL
IN HIS SHIN.
IF HE DIDN'T DO IT,
WHO DID?
THE MURDERER IS
RIGHT IN THIS ROOM,
SITTING AT THIS TABLE.
YOU MAY SERVE THE FISH.
EAT SOMETHING,
YOU FOOL.
WON'T YOU TELL US WHO?
I DON'T KNOW.
I THOUGHT IF WE HAD
A LITTLE GET-TOGETHER,
WE MIGHT FIND OUT.
NICE FOOD, ISN'T IT?
YES. IT'S THE BEST DINNER
I EVER LISTENED TO.
WHO DO YOU THINK DID IT?
MORELLI.
YOU CAN'T
PIN THIS ON ME!
WHAT AM I,
THE FALL GUY?
SIT DOWN!
I ONLY WANT
TO ASK A QUESTION.
MORELLI,
YOU KNEW JULIA.
YEAH.
WAS SHE GYPPING WYNANT?
SHE DON'T SAY.
I FIGURE SHE IS.
WHY'S THAT?
I WANTED 5 GRAND.
SHE GAVE ME CASH.
THANKS.
THREE MONTHS AGO--
THE NIGHT THAT
WYNANT CAUGHT YOU
IN JULIA'S APARTMENT,
MORELLI--
HE DISCOVERED JULIA
WAS CHEATING ON HIM
AND SPLITTING IT
WITH SOME MAN.
THAT MAN WAS...TANNER.
OH, I'M SO SORRY,
TANNER.
DON'T YOU WANT
SOME WINE?
NO. REALLY,
MR. CHARLES,
I HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH THIS.
TANNER, SIT DOWN.
THAT'S ALL RIGHT,
TANNER.
YOU'RE DRIVING
ME CRAZY.
OH, NOW, LET ME SEE.
WHERE WAS I?
OH, YES.
WYNANT WENT
TO FIND THE MAN
HE ACCUSED
OF HAVING CHEATED HIM.
THAT MAN, KNOWING HE WAS
CAUGHT DEAD TO RIGHTS
AND WITH PRISON
STARING HIM IN THE FACE,
TOOK THE ONLY WAY OUT.
HE KILLED WYNANT.
NOW, MR. JORGENSON--
YES?
YOU'RE NOT EATING.
DON'T YOU CARE FOR OYSTERS?
I WAS LISTENING
TO WHAT YOU WERE
SAYING.
GOOD.
THIS MURDERER
IS VERY CLEVER.
HE STUDIED THIS WHOLE THING OUT
VERY CAREFULLY.
YOU'D UNDERSTAND THAT,
WOULDN'T YOU, GILBERT?
YES.
NO!
HE PLANNED THE WHOLE THING
BEAUTIFULLY.
AFTER HE KILLED WYNANT,
HE WIRED MacCAULAY
USING WYNANT'S NAME
AND TOLD HIM
TO CLOSE THE SHOP.
WHICH I DID.
NATURALLY.
THEN HE DESTROYED
ALL OF WYNANT'S CLOTHES
WITH THE EXCEPTION
OF HIS WATCH CHAIN.
HE FIGURED THAT SOMEDAY
THAT MIGHT COME IN HANDY.
THEN HE TOOK WYNANT'S BODY
AND BURIED IT
WITH ANOTHER MAN'S CLOTHES--
A FAT MAN'S CLOTHES
TO THROW US OFF THE TRACK.
HE PUT IN A BELT BUCKLE
WITH AN "R" ON IT,
HOPING WE WOULD THINK
IT WAS ROSEBREEN--
AN OLD ENEMY OF WYNANT'S
WHO DISAPPEARED YEARS AGO.
OH, MORELLI,
WOULD YOU MIND HOLDING
YOUR KNIFE SOME OTHER WAY?
YOU'RE WORRYING GILBERT.
IF THAT KNIFE'S MISSING,
I'LL LOOK FOR IT
IN YOUR BACK.
AFTER OUR HERO
HAD KILLED WYNANT,
HE HAD A BRILLIANT IDEA.
HE REALIZED HE AND JULIA
COULD STILL COLLECT MONEY.
WYNANT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
OUT OF TOWN.
NO ONE KNEW WHERE.
OUR HERO WROTE LETTERS
TO MacCAULAY,
SIGNING WYNANT'S NAME,
SO MacCAULAY WOULD CONTINUE
TO SEND MONEY TO JULIA.
HE EVEN TELEPHONED
MacCAULAY.
THAT FIRST DAY
YOU CAME TO SEE ME,
HE TELEPHONED
HE WAS IN TOWN.
HE CALLED
WHILE I WAS OUT.
WASN'T HE SLICK ABOUT THAT?
THAT SAME AFTERNOON,
JULIA TELEPHONED HIM.
SHE SAID THAT
YOU WERE COMING, MIMI.
I WANTED TO ASK
ABOUT MR. WYNANT.
EXACTLY. WELL, OUR HERO
GOT TERRIFIED.
HE WAS AFRAID THAT JULIA
WOULD BREAK DOWN AND TELL YOU
HE HAD MURDERED WYNANT.
SO HE WENT TO JULIA,
AND HE KILLED HER.
HE LEFT WYNANT'S WATCH CHAIN
IN HER HAND.
Is this true?
I don't know.
Why are you
saying it?
It's the only way
it makes sense.
I hope
you're well.
HIS PLAN WAS WORKING
BEAUTIFULLY.
EVERYBODY BELIEVED
THAT WYNANT WAS IN TOWN
AND THAT HE HAD DONE IT.
THERE WAS JUST ONE HITCH--
A BIRD NAMED NUNHEIM...
YOUR FRIEND.
NUNHEIM HAD GONE
TO CALL ON HER.
HE HEARD THE SHOTS.
HE SAW
THE MURDERER LEAVE.
HE KNEW WHO DID IT.
IF HE KNEW,
HE DIDN'T TELL ME!
YOU CAN'T DRAG ME
INTO THIS!
OUR HERO HAD PAID NUNHEIM ONCE
TO KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT.
WHEN NUNHEIM
THREATENED HIM AGAIN,
HE BUMPED HIM OFF.
OH, HE WAS VERY CLEVER.
EVERYBODY, EVEN
OUR ASTUTE FRIEND GUILD,
THOUGHT WYNANT WAS ALIVE
AND WAS THE MURDERER.
YOU CAN SKIP THAT.
BUT OUR HERO HAD JUST ONE
WEAK LINK IN HIS CHAIN.
THE TELEGRAMS AND PHONE CALLS
WERE ALL VERY WELL,
BUT NO ONE HAD ACTUALLY
SEEN WYNANT,
SO OUR HERO PICKED ON POOR MIMI
TO STRENGTHEN HIS CASE.
MIMI IS THE ONLY ONE
AT THIS TABLE
WHO CAN TELL US WHO
THE REAL MURDERER IS.
MIMI, WHO TOLD YOU TO SAY
YOU SAW WYNANT?
NOBODY TOLD ME.
I DID SEE HIM.
LET MY MOTHER ALONE!
WHAT WERE YOU PAID?
IT'S TRUE.
I DID SEE HIM.
HE ISN'T DEAD!
YOU'RE LYING.
YOU'D DO ANYTHING FOR MONEY.
YOU WERE GETTING A GOOD PRICE
FOR SAYING YOU SAW WYNANT.
YOU FIGURED YOU WON'T
GET ANYTHING IF HE'S DEAD.
I'M NOT STAYING HERE
TO BE INSULTED!
MacCAULAY, YOU DREW UP
WYNANT'S WILL.
WASN'T MIMI CUT OFF
IF SHE REMARRIED?
I HAVE NO RIGHT
TO ANSWER THAT.
TANNER, ISN'T THAT TRUE?
YES.
THAT SHOULDN'T KEEP YOU FROM
TELLING THE TRUTH, MIMI.
MRS. JORGENSON, WERE YOU
EVER DIVORCED FROM CHRIS?
NO.
YOU SEE, MIMI,
UNDER THE LAW,
YOU'VE NEVER REMARRIED.
YOU'RE STILL
ONE OF THE HEIRS.
ARE YOU HOLDING OUT
FOR A FEW DOLLARS
WHEN YOU CAN GET
THE WHOLE ESTATE?
REMEMBER THE OTHER TWO MIXED IN
WITH HIM--JULIA AND NUNHEIM.
WHEN HE THOUGHT THEY MIGHT TALK,
HE BUMPED THEM OFF.
HE WON'T TAKE
ANY CHANCES ON YOU.
DO YOU WANT TO BE NEXT?
YOU DIRTY
LITTLE--
WELL, THERE'S YOUR MURDERER--
MacCAULAY.
MacCAULAY?
SURE. WANT ME TO WRAP HIM
IN CELLOPHANE?
COME ON.
GET IN THERE!
MacCAULAY!
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
WELL, I'LL BE
A MONKEY'S UNCLE!
NICKY, HE MIGHT HAVE
KILLED YOU!
YOU SORRY HE DIDN'T?
I'M GLAD YOU'RE
NOT A DETECTIVE.
NOT A HIP
IN A CARLOAD.
WELL,
HERE'S TO YOU TWO!
AND TO YOU TWO,
TOO!
WHY, THE RAT!
HE CAN'T TOP US.
NO.
TOOT, TOOT!
SHALL I KEEP THESE
FRESH FOR YOU?
YES,
THANK YOU.
HA HA HA!
MY GRACIOUS!
IT'S 1:00.
IT'S WHAT?
IT'S 1:00.
NO, BABY,
IT'S 11:00.
IT'S 1:00.
I SET MY WATCH AHEAD.
YOU SET YOUR WATCH
TO 12:00, DIDN'T YOU?
YOU'RE IN NEW YORK,
FOR INSTANCE--
NICK.
SAN FRANCISCO IS 3,000
MILES WEST OF NEW YORK.
THE SUN DOES NOT GET
TO SAN FRANCISCO--
NICK. NICK!
YES, BABY.
DOES THAT MEAN
IT'S BEDTIME?
HA HA! WELL,
THAT'S A THOUGHT.
OH, WELL.
COME ON, SUGAR.
LEAVE US DO IT.
ASTA.
WELL, GOOD NIGHT,
CHILDREN.
GOOD NIGHT.
AND FLIGHTS
OF ANGELS
SING THEE
TO THY REST.
SAME TO YOU,
NICK.
GOOD NIGHT.
NORA, I CAN NEVER
THANK YOU ENOUGH.
OH, DON'T BE
SILLY.
GOOD NIGHT.
GOOD NIGHT.
GOSH, DARLING,
I THOUGHT THEY'D
NEVER LEAVE.
OH, I THOUGHT
YOU'D NEVER LEAVE.
BABY, THE SUN RISES
IN THE EAST.
IT SETS IN THE WEST.
IF IT'S 12:00 IN NEW YORK,
AUTOMATICALLY IT'S--
NICKY, PUT ASTA IN HERE
WITH ME TONIGHT.
HA HA HA!
OH, YEAH?
