It's ok , cool...
Mister Abrahams, two transfers has been asked by yourself, one very recently
For the job at Sanarri , being fit...
And this one for Cassi, six months ago
Are you these two same persons, mister abrahams?
I....
I've done these two requests..

The first one...
being valid...
Because i want my file being conseidered as a fit person
As everybody
It's important for us... Handicaped persons !
To see in fit persons's sight , as you mister lebuick
Pity...
As you want mister abrahamas
If there is a problem for my file...
No no, not at all
It's just a necesarry check
You know, sometimes I have fake files
To get good job
In the south of France....
Oh no !
What a shame !
Oh  right ,mister abrahams
You will enjoy Sanarri sur mer
Well... I won't disturbe you anymore
You don't disturb me

What a shame !
Insane !
You are totally insane !
You are my friend , Jean
You will fix that, right?
I won't fix anything !
I don't want us to be friends ! Especially here
I'm not a friend of a mad man who fakes and pretend that he is a handicp person
I did that for Julie
I should'nt have done that
I swear, I regret
Well..
I have a bad and a good news

So what's the bad one?
You will stay for Two years there
Two years?

Two years in the Nord pas de calais... No! no !
You have no choice , you have to accept to work in the north or to quit your job !
How will i tell that to Julie?

Bergues, the beautiful city of bergues !
Bergues?
Bergues , in the nord pas de calais !
It's wonderful, isn't it?
Philip, what have you done?
me? nothing
i'm not stupid...
The ones who works well stay in the south of France
In the North, means that you did something serious
Not at all...
The direction proposes me to spend two years in the north
I get points !
I'm the first to get any jobs !
Especially in the south of France!
Because, if i spend two years in the Nord pas de calais, Im considered as a handicaped person !
i don't want to !
i won't freeze to death
Who will freeze to death?
Julie, we won't live outside there !
Dad, i don't want to loose my toes !
Why would you loose you toes?
i don't want to live in the North Pole...
We are not going in the North Pole , but in the North of france !
Philip , tell me the truth..
What did you do?
I have such a great promotion, i don't understand your reaction !
Well, i call Jean
In order to have the job in Sannari, i pretend to be a handicaped person..
pretend to be a handicaped person..
i'm sorry
You will go alone in the North Pole !
hello..
What is it?
Who is it?
You know who I am? I am philip, your nephew's husband
Oh yes.. She told me that you will annoy me !
What do you want?
i have to leave in the Nord pas de calais....
A transfer !
Julie told me that you knew a little the coutnry around Lille
yes, in 1934,
My mother has slept with a " ch'timi "
What a re you sayin'?
In 1934, my mother has slept with a "ch'timi "
A " ch'ti me "?
Not a " ch'ti me " a "ch'ti mi " , everybody is called like that in the north, children, wowen, men..
Des " ch'ti mis " ?
Even the animals are " ch'ti mis"...
cats too... cats....
Cows... Chickens.........
Veals...; all " ch'ti mis "
The language too is "ch'ti mi "
"o" instead of "a"
"che" instead of "que"
et "ce" instead of "ce"
It's diferent..
And when you thin you have understood , you think that a word is in reality an other one...
How is the life there?
Quiet no?
No...
tough , tough.....
There is only the ones who work in the coalmine who live well
The others are just...
Depressed...
And they die very young, very very young there
Fortunately , my mother moved in the south of France
i was ten
I could not bear the cool
Is it very cold?
In summer , it's ok, it's 0° or 1 °
But in winter, it's going down , down....
-10° , -20° , -30°
And also -40°
-40°?
IT'S THE NORTH !
You asked me kid, right? IT'S THE NORTH !
Did i answer?
Get out !
You see ! Freezing fog ...
What is a freezing fog?
It's horrible
No , you see? 6° in the morning and 11° the afternon, that's not so bad..
You think that these are the real temparatures?
Of course ! No?
Open your eyes, Philip
In the North, they fake the temperatures
Otherwise, nobody will come
You think?
Freezing fog....
It does not exist..
It exists !
Shut up , bitch !
Sorry not to come with you but I can't...
You are better here with the sun, with the kid
Why do you put off your down jacket?
I'll be hot , and when i'll be in then orth , i'll be cold
It's better if you wear that all time long
Raphael..
Take care of your mom
Can i count on you?
Yes you can !
It's my fault, all is my fault !
No... Julie, it's not yours, it's the destiny

The part of the cool that i regret most, is that I was delivering the mail with a sleigh !
With a sleigh, are you kidding me?

To the " French fries House"
"French fries House"....
What a pretty name !
Hello !
Hello..hello...
How are you? Fine...
Where is your restaurant?
What?
What restaurant?
Your restaurant...
"French Fries House "
aa.. It's not a restaurant !
a " French Fries House " is a French Fries House !
Right there !
It's a caravan...
It used to be a caravan ! Now its a French Fries House...
They don't sleep here anymore.. They're making french fries....
Hi there !
What do you want?
Hi momo...
As usually...
Yes !
Two French Fries with one american....
Allright !
"Fricadelle " and one american...
What do you want?
I don't know... Like you..
Add a " fricadelle " momo!
Which condiment?
Picadilly !
aaaa that's  gipsy food !
What?
No...no, it's our speciality !
That's good !
What's in there?
" Fricadelle " We can tell you what there is inside of it !
In the North, everybody knows what there is inside of it !
But nobody says it !
It's like americans with the " coco "
The what?
The " coco -colo "
aaa the coca - cola !
It's what he has just said !
The "coco -  colo " !
That a nice little place !
it's not the little place but the big one !
This church is lovely !
It's not a church !
There is nothing religious with it...
it's our belfry !
During the Middle age, it helps the army to prevent the ennemies to come in !
Let them come !
We see all the country here, it's beautiful !
But you need to ask Antoine to show you, he is the bellringer !
The what?
The bell ringer?
Right there, there are about 50 bells called peal of bells...
And Antoine is the only guy who know how to play !
In his family, everybody used to be a bell ringer !
When he plays, it's beautiful!
We hear him very far away...
it's true....
Momo, a beer please !
Oh Antoine, we were talking about you?
Really?
You were not talking about your biker? the show off man?
Why is not here, He does not like french fries the " boubours " ?!
It's not funny, stop !
me too I can show off with my bike !
Come to sit Antoine !
I know you !
It it the South guy !
Are you okay?
Are you allright Bailleul?
You know what he did that night?
I invited to my house
He saw the pictures of us on the wall and he freaked out. He closed his door
You were afraid that I fell in love with you?
Don't be out of respect !
it will be sad if I give you a warning the first day...
Oh ! I'm frighten !
Well....
No, we'll pay !
So? You didn't learn to say " thank you " in your country?
Antoine stop !
Enough !
you must be ashamed....
He has just arrived !
Imagine that you are in the South and that we speak to you this way !
We have been knowing for a long time with Antoine...
He is not a bad guy, you know !
It's not a reason to insult me...
And it is forbiddent to drink during hi work...
Especially his mother who makes his life more difficult...
It's not a reason !
You won't give him his warning?
Have you forgotten something?
How are you , Sir?
What do you wanr bailleul?
We agree with the colleagues...
We have all gave you something to furnish upstairs !
Look at that !
A chair..;
Look !
The footstool !
It's better than before, right?
it's look like a flat of Lille !
It's vey nice, it's wonderful, you didn't have to !
I'm a bit disapointed...
Why?
Beyond tonight, we don't sleep together...
How will I thank you... Except...
for the French Fries House..
Oh ! We can eat together In Lille !
Oh no.. my back hurts me so bad...
It's okay, you don't eat with your back !
You know Lille, Mister Abrahams?
Is it a cheese which smells bad again?
Sure, but it's a nice city too !
What do you want to eat?
I invite you !
There are a lot of specialities here !
The best one " le Chichon au gratin "
The " Chicon au gratin "?
No ! The " chichon au gratin " it's like big  endives with some béchamel sauce!
And the " Maroille Pie"
And the Maroille , I know what it is !
He has to taste the "carbonate "!
He must not leave before tasting the "carbonate "!
The what?
The carbonate !
It's like a  boiled beef with vegetables
We won't order everything...
We just have to take a little of each food ! and  we pick at one's food !
Right?
Yes !
It's not complicated to speak " ch'timi"...
For example...
We don't say : " Sorry sir, I beg you pardon , i didn't understand what you have just said"
We say : " WHAT?"
What?
No that's not a real " what" !
It has to get out from here !
What?
At the beginnig, when you start speaking " ch'ti "
or the " picard " we are similar...
You have to add a " what " at the end of the sentence !
Come on try !
I get it , what?
Great !
Ok , what?
Here, you speak " ch'timi" !
Damn !
no ! We don't say " damn", we say " vindedious " !
" vindedious ", what ?
Good job "biloute" !
Good job , who?
"biloute" !
Evrybody is called like that, it's a whole nickname !
What the meaning of " biloute " ?
" biloute "?
It means.....
that means nothing !
It means , little penis....
Little penis?
Yes, no... It's nothing about penis...
It's just affectionate !
ok ok !
Teach me insults ! it's important to learn insults when you star a new language !
We don't say " shit " we say " dubrin " !
We don' t say " jerk", we say " boubours " !
" boubours " !
In the South , we say " couillostis " !
That's pretty !
We don't say " hell !" but " miard " !
" dubrin " , " miard " , what? !!
I noticed too that..
We don't say " me " but "ti ".. No !
No ! We don't say " me " but " mi" and not " you " but "ti" !
Right !
It's like " che " become " ce " and " ce " become "che " !
Like " chores " became " cores " !
Right !
You have to order something !
No; no ,no...
yes ! it will be a training !
Yes, that's a good idea ! " Chek le dedans "
"check the..." what?
" Check le dedans "...
Which means?
Means, " let's do it Sir, don't be afraid !
Well...
Waiter !
Louder !
WAITER!!!!!
Great !
Good evening !
Good evening " biloute" what?

You can't ask him so many things...
He can't go to the French Fries House everyday !
Can i count on you?

Yes?
YES madam...
Well.....That's a bit tacky...
I won't tell anything... But I have some doubts...
Really !

Next please !
Hello madam, how may I help you?
I'd like to weigh that letter and stamped it .

That's cute...
You like this one? there is a hedgehog on it !
Yes, perfect...
envelope...
" vindedious " , 20 pounds !
it might be grams...
yes , right ! I was wondering what there was in it...
It's impossible.. how much are the stamps?
Is there a problem If i add stamps with  a goat?
Are you mad? You may be wrong !
What a mess........ No place for the hedgehogs...
I have to put the other stamps on the other side...
It's impossible ! you are wrong !
I have swallowed some stamps, but you don't pay for them, don't worry...
Stop it !
Give me that Antoine...
leave !
I take care of it madam.. You won't pay anything !
Don't worry, I'm on it !

You won't drink, trust me , it will be good for you...
Come on...
So?
That was awesome !
Great !
What?
Great !
Oh " dubrin " !
Great , right?
How are you Antoine?
Fine, fine , I won't " braire"
" braire "?
It means "cry"...
How do you say " laugh "?
" laugh" we say " laugh" !
That's the same !
We must at least speak a bit french , right?
About the work, everything ok?
no problem...
I'd like to tell you something....
We are all happy that you are our new director...
Thank you Antoine...
You live in a country very welcoming , really..
We maybe a country welcoming but if we have nobody to welcome , we thanks you...
You are welcome...
There is a huge ch'timi proverb which says...
" When a strranger comes in the north , he " braire " twice...
Once he arrives, and when he leaves "....
That's true i felt bad when i arrived there...
You'll see when you will leave...

We are gonna see this....
The south is my home...
We are gonna see...
here , 10 , 20 , 30 €
Thank you!

In the " South " !
Already friday?

" vindedious "...
Julie?
Surprise !
I have invited our friends to cheer you up !
Dad !
Hey little man !
Julie told us that you are through a living hell...
When i opened the Post office, it's still the night!
It's sunny at about 11:30 am !
And at 5 pm , suddenly , night !
They are all... depressed, whites , miserables...
Yes, they have not enough light...
And moreover the hygiene... Last week, a begining of a desease !
The... The cholera !
Cholera !
Cholera!?
yes...
Have you done your vaccines?
I have to !
We have to check !
The North is worst than the hell !
Weird... i used to work in the north...
I had such a great memory !
For the Easter week end, we may go to Belgium!
Why not?
i have to work..
What's wrong?
It embarassed you by seeing us?
no, not at all !
So what?
Kiss me !
Listen , it's ridiculous...
See you tonight !
Kiss me !
You hurt me!
Is there a problem , annabelle?
No , I'm okay !
What's wrong with the postman?
A problem?
You've got mails for me?
Stop.. Tony !
Shut up...
No I haven't...
But I have a text message...
As you don't know to read, I'll tell you...
Antoine stop it !
" it's forbidden to park in front of the Post Office , cheers the postman "
hey , is your mom here?
is she cleaning your room?
No no no stop ...
What's wrong bellringer, you wanna fight?
No, I'm against the violence between humans...
But about the objects....
Damn !
Are you insane?
Stop !
Antoine !
Stop that, Help me guys !
Stop Bailleul!
Stop !
Sir...?
Sir?
He does not look fine...
No , it's ok...
Look he is not aware...
It's OK !
Come on Sir...
He can't say no !
You know , you understand...
You know, people are happy when the post man arrives...
" Would you like to take a drink Antoine? "
Then....
Then... He fights in front of the post office ! that's serious !
He might say no , but i can say stop !
A reprimand? Maybe too much , Sir
You won't take his defense, right?
no i'm not !
I just want him to be good...
it won't fix everything if you give him a reprimand...
You know what is the real problem of Antoine Bailleul?
he is in love with you !
Actually....
We used to be together for a year...
Why did you dump him?
He dumbed me...
i don't get it..
I was very happy with him...
one day , I had an argue with his mother who is a bit...instrusive...
I was very upset...
i told Antoine to choose....
He chose...
What i have to do?  I'm the director of the post office.. not  a social worker...
It's beautiful Antoine....
Go ahead !
You are gonna give me a musical diploma or a reprimand?
Why don't you talk to your mother?
My mother?
i talked with Annabelle...
It's the relation with your mother which cause all your problems...
no...
Antoine...
My mother... i have to help her, she had a difficult life...
It's not helping her, if you don't tell her what you really think about her....
If you want to be relieved, we are all like you...
My wife.. I love her !
But i spend all my week end liying to her....
What?
Too long to explain...
i didn't know that you were married....
Thank you!
If you are married , why does your wife not come here to live with you?
My wife is...
Rather depressed.... Even depressive...
That's why if she came in the North it could be worse....
Why?
Hum... It could be worse for her... to leave her town.
in all places...
ok..
look Antoine...
I ask you to be careful during the work times...
it won't help you for your problems if you drink... it's even worse...
i behave like a "babache"...
We all do mistakes....
By the way, when you realised them, you must fix them....
If you can fix them...
It's always retrievable...
Except... his motor bike !
you wanna try?
What?
Playing the peals of bells...
No...
Why?
You might know a song, it's like a piano !
If I play, everybody will listen to it !
then , we must take the headphones !
Go ahead " biloute "
Not this one !
oh my god...
Not easy...
More pitched...
yes...
Antoine , wait, I come with you !
i know the road...
i'm coming with you...
it's time to say " no" !
You are the boss !
Hey " biloute " !

Since 1000 kilometers are between us, everything is perfect !
My wife is depressive ...
that helps so much that I live in the North...
that focus her mind in something concret....
tell me...
I'm afraid not to understand....
Yes, i lied to you... She thinks that I'm living in hell...
that i'm depressed...
The more she looks after me, the more she gets better...
Weird story...
Maybe, but it works...
We have never been so happy since I lived in the Nord pas de Calais...
What did you say to her about us?
Few " clichés "...
I have not invented...
I said that you were....
basics
a bit..
Simple...
a bit rude...
Sometimes vulgar...
Jerks....
Late....
And few things...
hello honey !
It's really pretty here !
My love, I have to tell you something..
Welcome to the " ch'nord"....
Welcome !
Welcome to the "ch'nord"...

Pretty wife !
Yep

Go home !
Look at that mess !
Where are we?
To bergues, honey...
We are arrived...
Ladies and gentlemen..
Who are all these guys?
Ther miners of the mine...
I thought the mines were stopped?
Not all, not this one..
Even if it's closed, we still live in there...
Where do you want us to go ?
"vindedious " what the hell...?
There, the town hall...
Right there, the Post Office, and in front of that, the party rooms, but there are not parties anymore..
It is worst than you told me...
it's what i try to tell you at the station... I didn't want you to see this...
are you living there?
Yes...
But it's rather shiny!
i forgot to say... We eat at 9 am , you must not be late...
We don't eat together?
No... It's the welcoming meal, if we don't go there, i'll be in troubles...
Talk to them, they'll be happy...
It's great to eat outside...
We don't have to stay too late, because of the tigers....
What are we eating?
Meat...
What kind of meat?
it depends of what we find...
You'll see !
Damn!
miss !
it's ok , we have enough meat, come on eat !
I'm coming !
Dinner is ready !
Thank you .
I can't...
I can"t...
Give me some bread...
Tomorrow...
We'll go to the mine and play hide and seek.
Great !
You think they go to sleep in their mines?
i don't think so, it's only 1 am...
We hear the neighbors...
What are they saying?
An argue...
like every single nights...
This is it , problem is finished...
oh my god, someone is dead !
no , don"t worry he shoots in the ceiling to afraid his wife ...
What a nightmare...
How can you live this way for two years?
First, how did you do to live until now?
I'll take something...
You should go home, it's too hard for you..
I'll bring you to the station tomorrow...
ok...
in order to take the rest of my clothes.
What?
Raphael can't join us...
He will live two years to my parents's house..
I'll move here, with you...
It's not possible....
i don't want it !
I love you...
your life is mine....
so?
i can't hear anything.. maybe they're sleeping...
Maybe we can start a fire !
Are you mad?
Are you "babache"?
Anyway , all the thing I propose, you don't care...
no...
The shotgun was a good idea.
Ok I do it again !
No !
Yann, enough !
Let's go home.
Don't you come Antoine?
No , i stay here, Somebody has to stay here..
ye, it's true...
Annabelle wait !
Is it better if you stay here?
Antoine...
Please...
No , because tomorrow, i'll be alone, it won't be work...
She will have doubts !
right now.. i'm the one who has doubts...
... The only moment where we are both In bergues, without my mother..
Good night.
So, are you okay?
no!
Neither do i...
Julie wants to stay here...
Here , in the North?
no , there , there ....
What?
You realize... We have done everything to disgust her...
And she agree to stay here...
But why?
Because she loves me.
"dubrin"...
I have fought for many years in order to live in the South and fix our couple problems..
And everything is getting better, here, in the North
Good for you , if everything is getting better.
What I am supposed to do?
She does not want to leave this hole !
Why don't you tell her the truth?
No...
I realized that my wife loved me, I don't want to make her upset...
Coward !
no i'm not !
yes , you are !
Your wife loves you, you too, so be true and tell her what you really have to say !
Antoine !
i don't have to take lessons of a 35 years old " boubours " who can"t leaves her mother !
What?
i say that you are not brave !
i can talk to my mother when i want !
Go ahead !
Go talk to your wife instead of telling me what i have to do !
OK i am busy with my wife, you with your mother !
Please?
Julie?
Julie !
Madam Abrahams?
Julie !
How may i help you madam?
I'm a bit lost, where is the Post office of Bergues?
Bergues?
It's not here...
We are in Bergues , aren't we?
No we're not...
It is the old miner city here....
Bergues is right there, far away...
Really?
Thank you.
Get in !
I'll bring you .
Get it, don't be afraid, i won't eat you .
My wife has disapeared...
no no, she is waiting for you, she is upstairs...
I had to tell her everything...
It's not " Versailles " but i live correctly...
It's the ch'tis who borrowed me some furnitures, they are very nice with me...
it has been months that you are telling me craps...
Many times I tried to tell you the truth, but i couldn"t.
I told you what you wanna hear..
You did all that stuff because you didn't want me here.
The less we see each other, everything gets better.
We separated in order to be a better couple.
Right?
I have to go back to the South
So, mister " biloute"
You've got some mails for your mother?
No, I need to talk with you mom.
What's going on?
Are you sick?
You have catched a disease?
No no mom...
I want you to listen what i have to tell you
Don't reply, i want you to listen...
And if you have something to say, it won't change things...
Because what i have to tell you is like that et you can't talk !
Ok?
I didn't say anything !
Yea
So...
I'll leave the house..
I'll buy a flat...
And i will move with Annabelle
Even if you don't like her...
I love her
And she is the one that i have chosen.
Here
What do you have to say?
Well ... Finally you did it !
I was wondering when you were able to ask me that !
Aren't you upset?
Why , i have to be?
I have all a mother dreams...
That her son finds his own happiness.
I didn't raise you for myself
And if you can do a little " biloute "
Or a little girl " biloute "
I'll be so glad , you know.
Ok?
Ok...
Is it the only thing you gotta ask me , because I have to finish my potatoes.
Thank you !
Think about it...
You must know that I'm here...
I'm coming , i'm here right now .
Kiss Raphael.
Hello Annabelle !
Hello Madam Bailleul !
What would you like?
I'm here to congratulate.
Good job !
You won my boy !
I leave him alone.
It's over !
I won't watch him anymore.
Beyond this day..
I watch you two !
You have to be happy ! Otherwise You 'll be in troubles !
You got it?
Congratulations!
Thank you!
We know each other with Annabelle on this song !
The singer comes from here !
" Ch'tivie Wonder"
I'm sorry, I'm not in a mood to laugh....
By the way, I didn't ask you what happened with you?
perfect...
I dare to speak with my mother.
i told her I will marry Annabelle !
How did she react?
She wants us to make kids !
Great !
Now, I just have to warn Annabelle...
You didn't talk to her?
I can't, i'm afraid that she says no ...
Is she still with her biker?
Dunno.
