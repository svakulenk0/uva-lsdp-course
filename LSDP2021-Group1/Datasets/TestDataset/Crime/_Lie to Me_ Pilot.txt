I've instructed
my client to remain silent.
He's not gonna talk.
That's okay.
I don't have much
faith in words myself.
Now, statistically speaking,
the average person tells
three lies per 10 minutes
of conversation.
And granted,
it's just regular people.
We haven't studied it in people who are
planning to firebomb a Black Church.
Could skew differently.
We don't have time
for this scientist to talk to the guy.
We went at him
for 4 h and got nothing.
Now, the FBI...
knows you want mass casualties,
so right now, the ATF is searching
every inch of the 2 largest
Black churches in the state.
The FBI got it wrong.
Well, there's a shocker.
Not one of those two churches.
Maybe you want...
one of the smaller churches,
in one of the Black suburbs.
- Don't know what you're talking about.
- Don't respond.
What do you say ATF
starts with Southbridge?
I'm only kidding.
We're gonna skip that one.
We gotta focus on Lorton.
You feel good about that?
That's it, Lorton.
- He's going after a church in Lorton.
- That accusation has no basis.
What do you mean?
He just told me.
The ATF found a pipe-bomb in a church
basement in Lorton an hour later.
A DOD friend of mine said
this guy's a total nutjob.
Heard he spent like three
years in the African jungle
with some primitive tribe,
studying their eyebrows.
Watch his reaction to my statement.
Right now,
ATF is searching every inch
of the 2 largest Black
churches in the State.
What you just saw there was
a brief expression of happiness
on his face which he was
trying his best to conceal.
Lasted for less than a fifth of a second
as what we call a microexpression.
Now, look his mouth.
The suspect is secretly happy about
the locations we are searching,
which tells me we have
the wrong locations.
Now, I tell him
of our new plan and...
You don't know
what you're talking about.
Classic one-sided shrug.
Translation: "I've absolutely no
confidence in what I just said."
The body contradicts the words.
He's lying.
When you accuse a suspect and he acts
surprised, is there a way to tell
if it's real or if he's
trying to look innocent?
That's real surprise.
Lasts for less than a second
when it comes across the face,
but if your suspect is surprised
for more than a second, he's faking it.
He's lying.
Now, I call out that his target
is actually Lorton.
And...
watch it again.
Concealed scorn.
One personal tip.
If you see this microexpression
in your spouse's face, your marriage
is coming to an end. Trust me.
Don't these micro-expressions
vary depending on the person?
Let's leave this up,
and we'll go to the Kato Kaelin footage
from the O.J. trial.
Mr. Kaelin, you've got a lot
of money for your appearance
on a current affair, didn't you?
Scorn!
Huge scorn.
Shame,
shame and shame.
Contempt,
these expressions are universal.
Emotion looks the same,
whether you are a suburban housewife,
or a suicide bomber.
The truth is written
on all our faces.

Just the man I was looking for.
- Today's the day. Say it.
- You're the shrink.
- I'm not big on self-affirmation.
- I'm telling you,
we cannot wait another
day to hire someone.
I found the one.
This is the one.
- Use your words.
- Why do we need to hire someone?
We got new requests this morning
from the DEA and Homeland Security,
The Prime Minister's
office in Uzbekistan called,
they want us to talk
to their senior police.
Tell them to call back when they
have a real constitution.
The analysis
from the blinking experiment.
- You're just getting in, Loker?
- Yeah.
I got piss drunk
last night with my roommate
and I was lying in bed this morning,
thinking about
how nasty hot Nancy Grace is
and just trying to decide
if I was gonna come in at all
'cause there's not
anyone here to fantasize about.
No offense taken.
I don't go for married women.
Cal!
Dr. Lightman,
I have the mayor on 2 for you.
Right.
Mr. Mayor.
All right, I see.
Of course.
Any time.
- What is it?
- Some blow-up
with the justice department about that
high school teacher killed in Northwest.
He wants us in on it right away...
What is that?
- Chocolate pudding.
- Who eats pudding at 10 in the morning?
People who like pudding.
The Mayor thanks you and Dr. Foster
for coming on short notice.
So this case is a land mine.
We've got a juvenile offender.
Family of devout
Jehovah's witnesses.
We gotta be real careful here.
murdered his teacher Susan McCartney.
After Mr. Cole got
into Miss McCartney's house,
he smashed her head
into a glass coffee table.
He then was caught fleeing
the house by two patrolmen.
He's been in custody
here ever since.
So what exactly does the mayor want
to find out about the McCartney murder?
Assistant US attorneys
Hutchinson and Estin.
The kid was at the scene of the crime,
he had motive, means
- and he resisted arrest.
- And he failed a polygraph test.
- It's murder one.
- Well, I guess we're all here, then.
Someone who wants the truth,
someone who wants to be right, and us...
the assholes stuck in the middle.
The US attorney's office
wants to try Cole as an adult.
But if the mayor is gonna
support sending a 16 year-old
to prison for the rest of his life,
he wants to be certain
we're talking about
a premeditated cold-blooded murder.
He wants you to provide
an independent assessment of intent.
We'll need the crime scene photos
and the autopsy report.
But I thought you could tell if somebody
was lying just by looking at them.
The question is never
simply if someone is lying,
it's why.
Look, I already told
the police everything, okay?
Tell us why you think
you're here, James.
I was out for a run and the police
thought I was running from them.
So they arrested me.
I heard you made
your school's track team.
I didn't make it.
They don't have tryouts.
What was your best race this year?
I don't know.
Probably against Jefferson,
last week. Why?
I ran hurdles myself.
Hundred and ten meters.
How'd your quads
feel during the race?
Good, I guess.
And what about on your run
the night you were arrested?
I felt fine.
Your teacher, Miss McCartney,
was found dead in her home.
Have you ever been
to her house before?
No, I've never been
to her house before.
Miss McCartney thought
that you should be held back a year
because she felt you were having
some problems with your classmates.
And what?
I didn't want to get held back.
How did you feel
when you find out she was dead?
I prayed for her soul.
I can't know God's plan.
But I didn't kill her.
Hurdles?
I could've run hurdles.
Please.
So you get a sense of his intent?
When I asked James about his best race,
he broke eye contact.
In order to remember and answer
truthfully. When I asked him about
his run the night of the murder
he never broke eye contact.
He wasn't recalling a memory.
- He was lying.
- But I thought most people avoid
- eye contact when they are lying.
- No, it's a myth.
And quite often,
they make more eye contact.
They need to watch to see
if you believe their lies.
The countent analysis
would suggest that James
has been to Miss McCartney's
house before.
"Have you ever been to her house?"
"No, I have never been to her house."
Rigid repetition like
that is typical of a lie.
Okay, so you'll tell the mayor's office
the murder was premeditated?
It looks that way.
But, when I asked him
about his teacher's death,
what we saw is this:
Oblique eyebrows.
Sadness.
Why would he be hiding
sadness for her?
- Looks like guilt to me.
- No.
It's possible he didn't
mean to kill his teacher.
- Excuse me?
- Could have been an accident.
Okay.
I indulged the mayor's office
on letting you talk to the kid,
but now, you're just making...
wild guesses that have
no basis in hard evidence.
This was no accident.
And personally I think
what you do is a joke,
it's a freaking carnival act.
I get that a lot.
You know, a moment ago,
I saw you smile at your colleague,
flash her a glance,
then shift your gaze.
She responded by raising her chin bow,
revealing deep embarrassment...
I'll take another "wild guess":
you two...
had a fling, but she doesn't want
to repeat performance because,
what with your wife and all,
but you won't move on.
Keep your fingers off your nose,
men have erectile tissue there...
itches when they're
hiding something.
I've been principal here
for over three years.
We've never faced
anything like this.
To lose a teacher
and then to find out
that a student might have
been responsible, it's...
I understand James
was new to the school.
Yes, his parents chose
to home-school him
until this year 'cause
they are devout Jehovah's Witnesses.
He was prepared academically
but he had real difficulties socially.
Did he ever express emotion
of any kind towards Miss McCartney?
He was sent to me a number of times,
but he never mentioned her specifically.
But I can tell you,
the boy's father had some strong
objections to Miss McCartney's teaching.
He was...
outraged that she had assigned the book
The Color Purple to her students.
He thought it was pornographic.
All right, they are ready for you.
But can I just say,
as much as we all mourn this loss,
no teacher believes that
this boy should go to prison for life.
He was in the photography club
for like five minutes before he quit.
Seemed like he didn't talk, ever.
He took really good photos, though.
I never saw him hang out
with anybody,
he's kind of intense,
like the way he stares at you.
He talked a bunch of crap
about Miss McCartney.
Really? Well, what did he say?
Kid's a freak, I mean,
I can't remember exactly, but...
I'm sure I heard him say
something psycho about her.
You wouldn't just be
saying that because
you got suspended
for hitting him in the face?
I was in bio lab with him.
I don't see how he could have
done what they are saying he did,
it's just...
I don't believe it.
I mean,
I've never even seen him get angry.
And why would he want
to kill her anyway?
Are you feeling emotional in
any way right now, Jacquelin?
- It's okay if you are.
- I feel fine.
Deputy Bonds.
And what did you
learn at school today?
Fifty-seven classmates
and not one credible account
of antecedent aggression from James.
I need to see the case file and look at
the other suspects Homicide questioned.
You don't think he is guilty?
I don't know, but if the prosecutor
wants to send a kid my daughter's age
to a cell block with
pedophiles and serial killers,
- I wouldn't mind knowing for sure.
- Whatever you need.
All right.
Forget it, we'll find another one.
Maybe he didn't see me,
why don't you get out?
You didn't see
me waiting for that space?
- Didn't see ya.
- Really?
No, I did not see you.
I was waiting too,
you must not have seen me.
That's fantastic!
Classic gestural slip.
You gave the slightest head nod yes
before he shook your head no.
Look, I'm in the space.
- And I'm not going anywhere.
- That's true.
You can't block me in like that.
Sir!
Congratulations, one liar down,
six and a half billion to go.
The US Attorney's office
scheduled the transfer hearing,
we have two days. I told
the mayor's office we need to examine
James' antecedent behavior
so we are set to meet his parents
- and his church group.
- How you doing today, sir?
- I'm great.
- Good. Could you step out of the line?
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.
Any reason you might be
anxious this morning, sir?
I'm worried I'll miss my flight.
I need you to open
the briefcase for me.
You know what? I'm gonna check it.
It's the liquids.
Stop.
T-3B Backup. Backup T-3B.
Open your briefcase.
You're gonna need to come with us.
Actually, you need to come with us.
When you crossed the line, I could tell
you were jacked up about something.
Because I flashed you
a partial fear expression.
Whatever.
But, why were you trying to play me?
Six years ago, Dr. Lightman
left the Deception Detection Program
he founded for the Defense Department.
Together, we started a private firm
works with police, corporations
and almost every Federal agency.
- We'd like you to come work for us.
- Why?
You've made seven times
more arrest than the average TSA agent.
And you scored 97 percent
on the TSA Deception Diagnostic,
which Dr. Lightman created.
Have you ever had
any specialized deception training?
I've dated a lot of men.
You're one of the naturals.
There's an infinitesimal percentage
of the population, less than.001,
that test nearly perfect
without any advanced training.
We've already cleared your leaving
with the TSA field director.
Our office will call you later.
- Don't forget your briefcase.
- That's your signing bonus.
I just had a long conversation
with the school guidance counselor.
The girl whose breathing you said was
fast and shallow, Jacquelin Mathis,
has had 3 appointments with
the school nurse in the past 2 weeks.
The guidance guy said typically,
that could be about drugs or an STD.
You know? Gonorrhea,
clap, crabs.
Find out if Jacquelin had any connection
with James Cole outside of school.
And follow up with the nurse.
Did the school principal
seem tense to you?
Wouldn't you be at his place?
He had his left hand in his pants pocket
pressed against his leg the whole time.
We're not all hiding something.
You think I'm naive, because I don't
share your twisted view of the world.
- That and you read romance novel.
- Yes I do.
Because they make me happy.
A pursuit I highly recommend to you.
Truth or happiness.
Never both.
What is that, now?
- Orange slushy.
- How old are you?
Chairman Baldridge from the Democratic
National Committee's on the phone.
- Some sort of crisis.
- Politician, that's for you.
Charge him by the lie
and we can retire tomorrow.
- Why isn't Dr. Lightman here?
- Cal really wanted to make it.
He's a better liar than you are.
- He's a better liar than all of us.
- I need your help, Gillian.
Congressman Zeb Weil,
whose career I spent 20 years building,
is about to be accused
of paying for sex.
A friend at The Post gave me
the tip but I need to know
- the truth before the story breaks.
- You think it could be a smear job?
I do.
But allegedly,
Congressman Weil frequents
some sort of high priced
escort service
at an underground club in Georgetown.
Now, if that's true,
it's gonna be a PR nightmare.
Because he's the new chairman
of the House Ethics Comittee.
That's delightful,
but we don't go through
people's dirty laundry.
Dr. Lightman just assumes
you're a liar if you're a politician.
He assumes you're a liar
if you're a homo sapien.
If these allegations are false
are you gonna stand by while
an innocent man is destroyed by lies?
- Thanks for coming in right away.
- You're the boss.
I would like to sleep with you.
Will Loker, Ria Torres.
He's harmless,
he just always speaks
the truth about what's on his mind.
- What do you call it again?
- Radical Honesty.
That's it. He'll get you started
on learning our facial coding system.
I have no chance with you.
Do I have any chance with you?
- You always tell the truth?
- Always.
How good are you in bed?
Fair.
Fair's better than most.
I don't see why you need
to look at James' bedroom.
Mr. Cole, anything that gets us
a better sense of your son is helpful.
- James took these?
- Yes, he did.
We let him convert that bathroom
to a dark room for his photography.
Is that a problem?
It was taking too much time
from his responsibilities
as a Witness doing God's work.
What did James tell you
about Miss McCartney?
He thought she was a good teacher.
And did you?
James did not kill that woman.
He would not take part
in wrestling practice for gym class.
Because he knows the Lord
condemns violence, even in sport.
If you value something, you build
a fence around it to protect it.
That's what we did with James.
We home-schooled him as long as we could
to shield him from drugs
and sex and corruption.
Is that why you were angry
about the material she was teaching him?
We are in the world
but not of the world.
And we need to protect
our children from non-believers.
Is there anything you wouldn't do
to protect your son from a non-believer?
Watch yourself.
I'm a man of God.
And I like horse racing.
Manhattans.
Briefs, not boxers.
All of which makes us equally likely
to lie, so... I ask you again.
Get out of this house.
I've been doing some research
into James' family.
I spoke to an Overseer of their church
who said Mr. Cole
has had fights with other churchgoers
over their "unholy lifestyles."
Some of them said he's an extremist.
There's something
going on in that family.
The police saw James running away from
the front door of Miss McCartney's house
after the murder. Maybe he was trying
to stop his father from killing her.
What was your content
analysis of the mother?
She was definitely concealing something.
When I asked her about Miss McCartney,
she stopped using contractions and
began referring to her as "that woman."
As in "I did not have sex relations
with that woman Ms. Lewinsky."
Distancing language. She knew something
about her she didn't want to say.
We need to look James' poligraph test,
to see what questions he spiked on.
Have I mentioned that your office looks
like it belongs to a serial killer?
Several times.
PD is running background checks
on both of parents and trying
to confirm their alibi
the night of the murder.
As for the girl who was so anxious,
no connection
to James Cole outside of school, but...
I do know why she might
have been anxious.
The school nurse insinuated
that Jacqueline is pregnant.
Pregnant?
Not what the father in
my shoes wants to hear. I gotta go.
I have Emily
and her boyfriend's coming over.
You worry too much. You do. You worry.
You're a worrier. You don't even know
- if they talked about having sex.
- He's taking her to a fancy restaurant.
Emily's a smart girl,
you have to trust her.
Her mother's a smart girl too
and I trusted her.
I think Roger's a loser
but if Mom wants to date a loser...
You don't have to say that for me.
I'm saying it because he's a loser.
I have the utmost respect for anyone
your mother cares
about and so should you.
Admit it,
you're thinking "what a loser."
I saw your eyes do the thing.
- Dan's early.
- About that...
I know your mom's out of town
tonight and you have the keys.
- And Dan has a car.
- We're not talking about this.
Can you please let him in
while I finish getting ready?
And you better not use some
covert scientific technique
to find out what Dan and I
are doing or not doing tonight.
Promise.
No covert science.
Promise.
- Hi, Dan.
- Hi, Dr. Lightman.
Are you gonna try
to have sex with my daughter tonight?
We appreciate your time.
Congressman Weil, have you ever
been to a club called Centurion?
Marshall, what is this really about?
I'm a five-term US Congressman,
I'd appreciate if...
Answer the question, Zeb.
I've never heard of it. Why?
It's been alleged that you go
to this club on Friday nights.
Tell me how you spent
last Friday evening.
I went for a swim
at the Congressional gym,
then I went home to catch up
on some committee reading.
Go on.
I had dinner alone before leaving
for an event at the Smithsonian.
Got it.
Now just tell it to me backwards.
What?
Start at the end of the night
and work backwards.
Before the event
at the Smithsonian, I...
Well, as I told you,
I did some reading and...
Before that, I...
That guy's lying his ass off.
Yes, he is.
When lying, it's hard to tell
a story backwards: there's no memory.
Liars repeat their stories in order,
they don't think
to rehearse them backwards.
Have you ever engaged
the services of a prostitute?
I am certainly not going
to dignify that...
And that is an expression of deep shame.
Is this guy religious?
That's what I don't understand.
Not religious, not married, no kids.
But he shows deeper shame than
politicans cheating on their wives.
Being the Ethics Chairman takes a lot
of the fun out of sex with hookers.
But seriously, what if he's into
something a lot more shameful?
Smacking them around
or underage girls.
I need to restore the expression
I had from James's polygraph up here.
Did you attack Susan McCartney?
The same shame expression.
Now punch in on his eye,
I want to see his pupil.
They're fully dilated.
And it's not fear or anger.
You know what else makes pupils dilate?
Sexual arousal.
You think James and Ms. McCartney
had a sexual relationship.
Maybe that's
what the parents were hiding.
My son did not engage
in sexual activity of any kind.
As I told you,
we're here
because we believe your son is innocent.
There is no sign of rape
or sexual assault on this crime.
But on his polygraph,
James exhibited intense
sexual feelings for Ms. McCartney.
- Gerald...
- Be quiet!
We saw you try to conceal
your scorn for Ms. McCartney.
That's not just about
the book she's teaching, is it?
What can you tell us
about the son and her?
I've already told everything.
Both of you and your son are lying.
Now let me tell you something,
the only way 3 people can keep a secret
is if 2 of them are dead.
So why don't you wake the hell up?
Everything you're doing
makes perfect sense.
You're afraid
for your son, Ms. Cole.
And when we experience fear,
we try to exercise whatever control
we can,
even if it makes things worse.
That's why you lied to us before.
It may help you feel better,
but it's not helping your son.
Because right now the only people
who believe James is innocent
are in this room.
I know that you have the courage
to move past your fear
and tell us the truth.
Wait here.
We found these hidden in James' room
before the police came
and searched his things.
I know how this must look but...
our son couldn't possibly
have done this.
Did you know James had been spying
on Ms. McCartney before you found these?
Did you ever talk
to James about sex?
I've talked to him about
the urges young men feel.
We read from Colossians together.
“Fornication, uncleanness,
sexual appetite is idolatry.”
He knows there's no greater sin.
I need to see
the crime scene photos.
You can't show
these photographs to anyone, please.
We need to show them to your son.
You took these.
And...
I understand why.
Ms. McCartney didn't
make you feel anger,
she made you feel temptation.
She was a beautiful woman
and for the first time
of your life you felt desire.
You took these pictures
so you could fantasize about her.
You spied on her.
For weeks. At school...
at her home.
You took these, hiding right here,
behind these trees
looking through the bay window.
And on the night of murder
you went back to her house
to spy on her.
And this is what you saw.
There she was.
You became aroused.
You gave in to temptation.
I didn't know she was dead.
And...
I started to have thoughts.
Unclean thoughts.
And I touched myself.
I swear to God,
I did not know that she was...
that she was dead.
It wasn't until afterwards.
I was walking away and...
I saw the blood.
I ran around to the front.
And I was gonna call 911.
But, the police came and...
I ran.
I just ran.
What was I supposed to do?
I told the truth! I didn't kill her!
I told them what I did!
What was that?
You spoon-fed him a good defense
and he's not stupid, he went with it.
But there is still a preponderance
of evidence against him.
- More than enough for a Grand Jury.
- James was telling the truth.
He lied when he said he'd never
been to Ms McCartney's house before.
And these photographs go a long
way toward proving premeditation.
You aren't going
to reconsider other suspects?
He was stalking the victim,
fled the scene, and failed a polygraph
- the night of the murder.
- All for the same reason. Sexual guilt.
Polygraph only tells you
if someone is feeling guilty,
and not what they're feeling guilty
about. The guilt James felt had
- nothing to do with the murder.
- you wanna ignore the evidence, fine.
I heard how things ended
for you over at the Pentagon.
And, unless you want
the entire Justice Department
picking apart every case
you worked for us too,
you'll leave this one alone.
There she is.
Hey, honey.
Hey, Cal. I'm sorry I'm late,
There was a bunch of work
I had to finish before leaving.
Why don't you come to dinner with us?
Clear your head for an hour.
- It's gonna be a late night.
- I'm good. You go ahead.
Good night.
Her husband just lied to her.
He was lying when he said
he got held up with work.
Don't you have work to do?
You're not gonna
tell her he's lying?
How are we doing on the Congressman
and the sex club thing?
Congressman Weil still
won't admit anything,
so I'm gonna go
at the club tonight and see
if I can find out what he did
that he's so ashamed of.
The girl Weil's been
seeing goes by Melissa
and he sees her every Friday
night without fail.
Classy.
We all pay for sex,
one way or another.
At least hookers
are honest about the price.
I bet your boyfriend's pretty
happy this is his birthday present.
So how do you like this place,
Melissa?
It's great. Always a party.
You really hate it.
It's just for now.
It sucks being broke,
and I can make a lot more
money here than I did dancing.
So are most of your clients
regulars or one-offs?
Mostly regulars actually.
Maybe Julian and I could...
That's my boyfriend.
Maybe we'll become one of your regulars.
Are you free next Friday night?
Not Fridays.
I...
I have...
I have a regular on Fridays.
I don't think the Congressman
was doing anything nasty to her.
She had this little smile about
her Friday nights with him.
Like she has feeling for the guy.
Was there wrinkling around
her eyes when she smiled?
- Yeah, there was.
- Then it was real.
In a fake smile,
there's no eye wrinkling.
Excuse me.
Turn on the news.
There's much to be learned still.
But House Ethics Chairman Zeb Weil
reportedly spent more
than eighty-two thousand dollars
on a single escort over
a matter of months.
He exited his Congressional
offices moments ago...
Look at his disgust.
Yeah, but he's not
disgusted with himself.
It's like he's disgusted with
the idea of having sex with her.
Maybe they weren't having sex.
Why would a guy spend $1.800
on an escort he's not having sex with?
Yes, of course.
No, I understand.
The defense attorney says James
***** psychological collapse.
He won't eat,
sleep or talk to anyone.
He's on suicide watch.
Take a look at these.
Her clothes are identical
to the crime scene photos.
James took those the day of the murder.
And you can tell it's late, probably
a couple hours before she was killed.
Look at her hand.
What?
It's tensed and turned
upward at her side like this.
Is that a gestural emblem?
When we make it consciously,
the meaning's clear.
Stop. She was having an argument.
It had to be pretty disturbing
- to produce that emblem.
- So whoever was in that car
had a fight with her just hour
before she was murdered.
Body language tells the truth...
even from the grave.
Principal Castle,
Thank you for seeing us.
Please. Anything to help.
Do you know, who at school,
might have had an argument
with Ms. McCartney
the day she was murdered?
I have no idea.
Do you think another
student was involved?
Possibly. We need to know
who drives this car.
Sure.
I can see if it's registered
for school parking.
Is that your car?
No, it's not.
Were you romantically
involved with Ms. McCartney?
Of course not.
What are you suggesting?
I'm sorry. I really am.
We have to consider everything,
and I'm sorry if I offended you.
Yeah, I'm very sorry.
Very sorry, if I offended you...
I am sorry.
I have offended you
and I'm so sorry.
It's not a good thing, really.
I apologize.
What's with the Rain Man routine?
Want to know how scared he was after
you showed him the photo of the car?
- How scared?
- In skin temperature,
about 10° scared.
Which is to say very scared.
His hand was colder
the second time you shook it...
He recognized that car,
and intense fear kicked in.
It's a classic
physiological flight response.
Blood flows out of the extremities
to the legs so you're ready to run.
Hands get cold fast.
The car in question doesn't belong
to the Principal or his wife.
You're sure?
Deputy Bonds had records run
both their registrations.
So Principal Castle
recognized the car, but it's not his.
Find out whose it is.
Have them run the registrations of every
students and teacher of the school.
The DNC Chairman's going ahead
with a press conference this afternoon.
But I know what Congressman Weil
was doing at the sex club
and why he was so ashamed.
Take a look.
He filed this on-line two years ago.
Call me the second
you hear about the car.
Come on.
You haven't done enough
muckraking for one day?
Sir, we don't think you were doing
anything sexual at that club...
Because I believe this escort,
"Melissa"
- who you paid for time with...
- What about her?
She's your daughter.
I've already admitted what I did.
I'm tendering my resignation today.
This is the profile you registered
in May 2006 on Adopt Connect,
registry for birth parents trying
to reconnect with an adoptee.
The adopted name you listed
was Brenda Melissa Johnson,
The date of birth would
make her Melissa's age now.
I was a junior in college at U.A.
and I was seeing a young woman
who was a freshman
at the women's college in Marion.
She got pregnant.
We agreed
to a closed adoption.
We both moved on,
but I never stopped
thinking about it.
A couple of years ago,
I registered to be found,
but nothing came of it.
So I hired a private investigator.
Does Melissa, Brenda,
know you're her father?
I didn't want
to force her to confront
an answer she clearly
wasn't looking for.
But when I found out
she was working at that club,
I had to do something. So I went,
started to get to know her,
gave her money,
and tried to get her to quit.
We can tell the Chairman,
and the press.
Please, no.
No?
I'm close to getting
Brenda to make a change.
If the press finds out
who she really is,
she will spend the rest of her life
being known as
the "Congressman's whore daughter."
I already betrayed her once.
I won't do it again.
The car belongs to Jacquelin Mathis
the girl who the school nurse
thought was pregnant.
Deputy Bonds had Homicide bring her in:
Second District Station right now.
Why would I know what happened
to Ms. McCartney?
- You tell me.
- Why would I know?
"Why would I know?"
Eyebrows up, like yours,
and the person
knows the answer to the question.
But I don't.
- And I don't feel well.
- Morning sickness?
You argued with Ms. McCartney
the afternoon she was murdered.
No. You don't know
what you're talking about.
I know when you're lying.
- I'm not lying.
- I know why you fought with her.
I didn't.
This is your car?
I didn't kill Ms. McCartney.
That's the truth.
I know you didn't.
But you know who did.
So tell me about the argument.
I don't have anything to say.
You know James Cole is innocent.
He's gonna go to prison for life.
Are you going to help let that happen?
Maybe you couldn't have stopped
the murder but you can stop this.
You have to stop this.
I can't...
It doesn't matter anymore.
And you'll have to live with this.
'Cause James Cole
just hung himself in his jail cell.
I thought nothing
would really happen to James
'cause he's a minor.
I didn't know that he was gonna...
My God.
Why did principal Castle
recognized your car
when I showed him the photograph?
You were involved with him,
weren't you?
Castle took advantage of you.
He didn't take advantage of me.
We were in love...
He loves me.
You're pregnant, aren't you?
He was going to leave his wife
to be with me.
He told me...
But Ms. McCartney saw us
parked in my car,
just beside school.
We didn't know, but she saw us...
She came up to me later
in the parking lot
freaking out like she had to be
all worried about me when...
I mean, I was the one
who went after him.
And you argued about turning him in?
I begged her not to.
He hadn't done anything wrong.
But she didn't listen.
She said she was going
to turn him in, so...
I told him.
He said that everything would be okay,
that he'd talk to her...
I didn't know
that he was going to kill her.
I didn't know...
You get the email
from the U.S. attorney's office?
Principal Castle confessed
in exchange for thirty years.
I thought the truth'll set you free.
Speaking of which,
do you still have that note
I brought you?
I want it for my office.
You really are a pack rat.
You couldn't just told me
what this was for?
No, you're a terrible liar.
Normal people
think that's a good thing.
- Are you saying I'm not normal?
- Good night.
Go home.
What are we going to do
about the Congressman?
Nothing.
So, we're going to let him throw away
his career? We're basically gonna lie?
Not basically.
So you lie to your partner
about her husband,
and you lie to the people
who hired us...
what am I supposed
to believe about you?
You believe whatever you want.
It's what everyone else does.
I'm glad we're spending the holidays
with your family.
Your folks are great.
I'm saying I didn't want this promotion.
I feel terrible they fired her.
I love you. I'm gonna leave my wife,
I just need a little more time.
Excuse me...
