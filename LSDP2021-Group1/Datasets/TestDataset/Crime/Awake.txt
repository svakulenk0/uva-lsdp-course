It's over, Jack.
I'm sorry, Jack.
Hey.
Hey.
What were you doing under there?
Just thinking.
What about?
Wait, let me guess.
You were thinking about
making love to me all morning
and then taking me out
for a really big breakfast.
- Close.
- Yeah?
Actually, I was...
picturing you soaking wet
with all of your clothes on.
- No. Mm-mm.
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-mm.
- Mm-hmm.
- Dah. Ah.
- Oh.
Damn it.
All right, hang on.
Tell me if it hurts, okay?
- Ah!
- Shit.
-
- You're such an asshole.
- Come here.
- I didn't scare you, did I?
You did.
There we go.
How's it look?
You'll live.
Thank you.
Have you seen my pager?
- Yep.
- Ah.
- Wait. Hang on.
-
- There you go.
- Thanks.
I don't care, Tommy.
They open at 6,
we open at 5, all right?
There are jobs at stake, man.
Just get it done.
Then we'll talk to them at
the Halloween thing tonight.
Yeah, all right. I'll be in soon.
Got time for a little breakfast?
You know I can't.
You know, share a paper,
trade sections?
Baby, I'm late as it is.
I don't even know
what section you like, Clay.
I deserve my happily
ever after, too.
I know you do.
And I'm going to tell her, soon.
I promise.
Have a good day.
You, too.
Good morning, Mom.
Don't forget we're
meeting the board at 2.
I can't do 2.
I'm meeting with Dr. Harper
this afternoon.
Just be there.
These Japanese companies
are ruthless.
We have to close this merger.
Is this about your old man?
Is it about him?
Jesus, I'm not going through this again, Jack.
Honestly, he would
want you to tell her.
No, my father would want me
to stop fishing
in the middle of the day
and go back to work, all right?
If he knew what I was doing
with Sam, he'd disown me,
lying to my mom like this.
He'd throw me in the fucking river.
I want you to
take a good look around you, Clay.
You own half of this city.
You're creating jobs,
you're saving companies.
I think you've more than
filled his shoes, you know?
My dad's feet were four sizes bigger
than mine, Jack.
I can't even fill his socks.
Look, I got the rings, didn't I?
I got the license.
No, no, no, no.
It's not that difficult.
You set a date and you just do it.
It's not that easy, either.
- I mean, marriage...
- Look, she's your mother.
You tell her and, I swear to you,
she'll be happy.
You don't know my mother.
Listen, thanks for the fishing lesson.
- I'm leaving, all right?
- All right, man.
Look, just...
just come on with me.
You know how many
bullshit malpractice lawsuits
there are in this country?
I mean, a hard-working
doctor is trying...
Are we going to go
through this again, Jack?
- Well, look, I've got...
- Four. Yes, I know.
All for trying to save people's lives.
It's a disgrace.
Well, you know why they sue us?
I have a very busy day.
Please.
It's because they don't know
what to do with their grief.
It's because people
need someone to blame.
It's because of patients like you
who cannot accept the facts.
Come on in.
Get acquainted. Lie down.
Only because you're my friend.
I'm your doctor.
Get comfortable.
How's it feel?
Not so bad.
These, Clay, are the facts.
When I open up your chest
and remove your heart,
it is a very real possibility that you will die
right here on this table.
And if the transplant is successful,
there is a 50% chance
that you'll be dead in 10 years.
The clock's ticking.
So it's tough love today, huh?
You think this is a joke?
Look at that.
Hold it.
That's surgical steel.
A hundredth of an inch thick.
That thing will slice through you
as if you weren't even there.
Picture it, Clay.
Picture the incision.
Imagine what it will be like.
I need you to be ready.
I need you to be prepared.
You get your house
in order, just in case.
Tell your mother, marry the girl,
and live your life.
You might not have much of it left.
Okay?
Jack...
saddle up.
Wait, I thought we didn't
have anything until later.
No, Riordan's cabbage
from this morning,
he's in the ICU bleeding.
He took off for
the fucking vineyard,
so, uh... Hey, Clay.
How about letting us
have all your money
so that we could retire?
You wouldn't mind
doing that, would you?
No. You know me.
Go ahead, take it all.
What a guy.
Remember what I said, Clay.
No regrets.
Jack!
The clock's ticking.
Jack, what are you doing?
Let's go.
Let's go, Jack.
Come on!
Well, I've got a big
Halloween party tonight,
but how about
I sneak out afterward?
Well, I can't. I'm...
I know it's daylight
and all, but I missed you.
You look beautiful, Sam.
I do?
Yeah, you do.
I should tell you that more often.
What's wrong?
I'm sorry.
I didn't know she was going
to be here, all right?
If I turn around, she'll see.
This is getting boring, Clay.
Uh-huh.
We're going to have to
discuss this merger later.
I feel sick.
You're not supposed
to make me feel sick.
Thought you'd run off and left me.
You remember Dr. Neyer,
don't you?
Hello, Clayton.
Good to see you again.
We've already been through this.
Dr. Harper's my surgeon.
I've already told you...
I know, but Jonathan
leads the field, remember?
Yeah, well, like I said before,
I have a surgeon.
Now, I know he's been
on the donor list for a year, Lilith,
but that's completely
normal for his type.
O-negatives like you and your son
always wait a little longer.
It just means
you're special, that's all.
Excuse me.
I don't think you're listening
to what I'm saying...
Although, since he has
a cardiomyopathy
of undetermined etiology...
Hey.
I'm sitting right here.
You want to talk
about me, talk to me.
- Clay.
- It's fine, Lilith.
You and Dr. Harper
have obviously become friends.
He was on call when you had
your first attack.
He saved your life.
I get the attachment. Really, I do.
But your mother and I
have been friends for 15 years.
My hands have been
inside presidents.
Don't you think I might at least
deserve the time of day?
You want to be operated on
by the best surgeon possible.
Don't you, Clay?
Good.
Now let's talk about the party tonight.
Sir, they need you out there.
Thank you.
Welcome.
My daughter Tanya and my wife.
Happy Halloween.
Oh, here he is.
Whiz kid of Wall Street,
Man of the Year at 22:
Clayton Beresford, Jr.
Sir, I'd like you to meet
Mr. Inamoto and Mr. Waturi.
They're with our friends
at Shimotomo.
They're here to check up on you.
They know about your condition.
Mr. Waturi would like for you to know
how much respect he had
for your father,
Mr. Beresford.
He was quite a businessman.
Yes, he was.
Mr. Waturi would also like to know
how you're feeling today.
Well, you'll have to tell Mr. Waturi
that I feel fabulous.
Please also tell him that I'm ready
to cut to the chase
whenever he is.
In the last eight quarters alone,
we bought and nurtured
over 600 companies.
We donate 80 million
charitable dollars per annum.
We provide over 16,000 jobs.
Mr. Waturi, my heart may be weak,
but my mind is strong.
And the only thing
you need to worry about
is which one of our 17 Niigata sakes
you'd like to enjoy with your dinner.
You're a ridiculous person,
you know that?
I don't know how you say that
with a straight face.
I mean, it's just... it's ridiculous.
I'm serious this time.
Let's just leave
the country, you know?
Go to China.
Try our luck on the black market.
Why don't we just go outside?
We'll grab some random
person off the street,
drag them in here, you know...
Sounds good to me.
Drag them in and cut them open.
Hey, whatever it takes, right?
You worry too much,
you know that?
Oh.
They'll find me one.
It just takes a little time, that's all.
You're not going to like this.
Straight to the king.
Oh, nice hand!
Boat. Jacks over eights.
- Are you kidding me? Again?
-
Come on, you're my son.
Can't hide anything
from your mother.
I think I need to go upstairs.
Don't stay up too late.
I thought you might like a little drink.
Oh, maybe one. Thank you.
You're up late.
Something on your mind?
Got to get my family time in now.
You know, before some
smoothy whisks you away.
Yeah, right.
Like that's going to happen.
I don't know.
I think maybe somebody
had a little baby crush on Dr. Neyer.
I saw the way
you were looking at him.
I don't need anyone else.
I got you, Clay. Remember?
So, I closed Lambert today.
That means if we get
a hold of Mecter too,
that's 2,000 new jobs guaranteed,
plus new housing...
Do you remember him, Clay?
I remember bits.
Like what?
He died at Christmas.
Come on, don't you
remember anything else?
Sure, he was wearing a Santa suit,
and he fell down the stairs.
I mean from when he was alive, Clay.
I remember he smiled a lot.
Sorry to interrupt, Mrs. Beresford.
Uh, door was open.
What?
I just need your signature.
I know it's late,
but I want to get this out tonight.
Of course, Sam.
Thank you.
The Edmond "thank yous" are done,
your table's locked for the benefit,
and I put you down for the roast beef.
I know it's your favorite.
You're too good to me, Sam.
Well, if that will be all,
I... should be heading home.
- Good night, Mrs. Beresford.
- Night.
Mr. Beresford.
Sam!
- Sam.
- I'm tired, all right?
I just want to go home.
Actually, fuck it.
You got me hiding
my engagement ring, Clay.
What is wrong with you?
- Will you come under the umbrella?
- No.
I've been engaged for six months.
No one even knows I'm dating anyone.
Do you have any idea
how that makes me feel?
I'm sorry.
If you won't even acknowledge me,
how do l...
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, okay?
For Christ's sake, Clay,
what are you doing?
You can't be in the rain.
Will you come inside
so we can get warm?
But she'll see.
Are you sure?
Unless you'd rather stand in the rain.
I should have done this
a long time ago.
She's not going to like it.
Come on.
I trusted you in my home, Samantha.
How could you come in here
and sneak around?
Please.
Clay, she lied to me to my face.
- She's a liar.
- I can't stay here forever.
I'm not asking you to.
Just... wait a bit.
Get to know each other first.
We've been together for a year.
Then wait till you're a little older.
How old were you
when you got married?
It's different. I was too young.
Clay, you've got your
whole life ahead of you.
Do I?
If you walk out that door,
you've made your choice.
You're making it for me.
Sam, wait.
Oh... oh, God.
Okay. Um...
Nope.
Here we go.
Look what we've got here.
All right, sweetie.
All right. Open up, honey.
You okay?
You okay?
I am so sorry.
I just needed to be acknowledged, that's all.
I'm going to go away
and leave you two alone, okay?
Marry me.
What?
Tonight. Right now.
Marry me tonight.
But it's the middle of the night.
I don't want to wait anymore.
We've waited long enough.
Really?
The minister is on his way,
and he's bringing
his wife as a witness.
How the hell did you
pull that one off?
Triple bypass last June.
I'm calling in a favor.
You're a good best man, Jack.
- Thank you.
- Okay, hold on.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.
- No, no, no, no.
- Come on, please! Please, please, please.
- We had this conversation.
Clay, I am pulling
I've gotta drag these
little moments out any way I can.
Just... Just one, okay?
You gotta take the lens cap off first.
Oh, okay, hold on, hold on, hold on.
Just one, just one.
Oh, man, look at that.
- An actual smile.
-
So proud of you.
I, Samantha Jane Lockwood...
I, Samantha Jane Lockwood...
take you, Clayton Beresford, Jr...
take you, Clayton Beresford, Jr...
to be my lawful wedded husband...
to be my lawful wedded husband...
to have and to hold...
to have and to hold...
from this night forward...
from this night forward...
for better, for worse...
for better, for worse...
for richer, for poorer...
for richer, for poorer...
in sickness and in health...
in sickness and in health...
till death do us part.
till death do us part.
Clay.
Clay, whoa!
Whoa!
What are you doing?
What do you think I'm doing?
What is...
Clay.
Clay.
They're the only ones with the number.
Holy shit.
I love you.
I love you, too.
Here.
There he is.
The man of the hour.
Now, what took you two so long?
Sam, this is Dr. Puttnam.
- Hello.
- Hello. Nice to meet you.
I've heard a lot about you.
Clay's a lucky man.
I am.
Shit. I'm sorry. Sorry.
You'll have to excuse Penny.
She's not from around here.
You walk on the other side
of the road over there, huh, Penny.
Very funny.
Sorry I'm late.
Had a hard time getting a sitter.
Penny Carver. Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you, too.
Sorry about him.
Oh, it's all right.
We're used to it by now.
So, D.C., gunshot to the head,
O-negative, perfect crossmatch.
Heart will be here in two hours.
And your mother's here.
What?
- Wait, she's here?
- Mm-hmm.
What? She's on the call sheet.
You certainly took your time.
Dr. Neyer's performing
this transplant across town.
Would you please clear it
with administration?
Actually, I'm staying right here.
What?
- Hello, Jonathan.
- Jack.
You two know each other?
Of course.
Dr. Jack Harper,
Head of Cardio
Varick University Medical.
Two mortgages, two ulcers,
two ex-wives.
You sound like my ex-wives.
You still fishing
in the East River, Jack?
Well, some of us
just don't have the time
to make it to the North Shore
every weekend.
Clay, this man has three malpractice suits
against him.
Three. I checked.
Four. l...
I think it's four, right, Jack?
You think this is funny?
Clayton, this time next year
I'll be Surgeon General.
I write textbooks on this procedure.
Really?
That's... That's great.
I, uh...
I sure hope you've read them, Jack.
Will you excuse us for a minute?
Look at me. Look at me.
This isn't about her.
I'm not risking your life
on some second-rate doctor.
He's my friend, Mother.
I trust him.
I really wish you'd start trusting me.
I'm sorry, darling.
The answer is no.
I wasn't asking for your permission.
All right, I'm going to leave you guys
for a minute, okay?
Thanks, Jack.
Looks nice.
Does it fit?
Yeah. It's perfect.
Quite a night we're having, huh?
I'm scared shitless.
I know. Me, too.
But, hey, you know what?
As soon as you get out of here,
we're going to start from scratch.
Get a little house on the beach.
- Mm-hmm.
- Do it right, you know?
Chase seagulls.
What do you say?
As soon as you get out,
I'll be right here.
You think my new heart will love you
as much as my old one?
Okay, lovebirds.
We gotta go.
All right.
I'll see you soon... wife.
Say that again.
Wife!
Sometimes you have to hold the button down
for a while to get it to work.
I don't need your help.
Guys, I'm Dr. Lupin.
Uh, you can call me Larry.
I'd shake hands,
but, uh, heh, you know.
- Who is this? What's going on?
- I don't know.
Your colleague,
Fitzpatrick, got laryngitis.
They called me up
from Saint Mathew's.
I thought Fitzpatrick
was going to be here.
Yes, me, too, but we have Larry now.
The players may have changed,
but the game is still the same.
We've been, um,
together a long time.
Sort of like a little family.
This is Dr. Puttnam.
I understand.
It's a pleasure, Doctor.
How's the patient feeling?
Okay.
Everything all right?
Just fine, Clay.
Hey, Penny.
I'll see you in a few hours, okay?
All right.
Okay, Clay.
This is it.
Mm-hmm.
You just relax, all right?
The next time you see me,
this is all going to be over.
See you soon.
Be gentle with him, okay?
Okay, just gonna give you
a little oxygen here.
They already asked you
if you had anything
to eat or drink in the last four hours?
Yeah.
And you've had general anesthetic before?
Mm-hmm.
Good.
I read your pre-op assessment
and came up with a nice
little cocktail.
A little abduction agent.
You're going to like this.
Hang on tight.
Oh, my God.
Yeah. That's Him all right.
Go ahead and count back
from ten for me, will you?
Ten...
nine, eight,
seven...
si...
Happy trails, my friend.
Let's get going.
Hey, Larry, what did you use here?
Midazolam? Fentanyl? Hmm?
Yeah, with a little
pancuronium chaser.
How does he look, Larry?
Everything okay?
Sleeping like a baby.
Is he good to go?
Jack...
You ready?
Ready as I'll ever be.
All right, let's get the drapes on.
Give me another drape right here.
We're okay to go?
Scalpel.
Do we have blood in the room?
Yes. We have four units.
We gotta get
this thing sharpened.
Having a hard time getting through.
- Saw.
-
- One, two...
-
- Ready?
That's it. Just focus on her.
Wow! Hey!
The place used to be a speakeasy.
No, you didn't...
- of the Lord to lay
Clayton Beresford to rest.
- and a loving father.
Clayton?
Clayton, are you paying attention?
If it is made manifest by the third...
Okay, we have a massive
heart attack, possible M. I.
What's his name?
Stay with my voice, pal.
You're gonna be fine, okay?
Okay, open him up nice and wide.
Hey, follow my voice, pal.
We got you.
Stay right with me, okay?
There goes a rib.
Oh, that's going to hurt tomorrow.
Have a seat.
...I kind of like to do
a follow-up with someone
after I've saved their life.
You don't feel grateful
or anything, do you?
We're going to need a transplant.
You tell me. You're the doctor.
You do much fishing?
What do you do as a billionaire?
You just sit around and eat shrimp?
- You always keep your cell on...
...and that would be it.
Oh, and that'd be Clay.
- Awful table manners, always late.
- You'll get used to it.
Oh! Holy shit, I'm sorry.
I...
This is embarrassing.
I thought you were
at your office...
So, nice to meet you, too.
My name's Sam.
We are going to where
the other half lives.
Let me guess,
never been on the subway before.
No.
Never been to Brooklyn, either?
- To be perfectly honest, never.
- Wow.
Oh, you really shouldn't
be smoking these things.
Miss, um... Ramos?
We're ready for you. Room 5.
Right down the end of the hall,
on your right.
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.
Hi. How are you doing?
Hey.
Can I help you with something?
Haven't I... seen you around?
Guess not.
Sorry.
You have two rings on your finger.
What was that?
Why are you wearing two rings, Sam?
When?
Just before he got the call.
Lilith...
Who needs all
those extra nurses, anyway, huh?
Well, I'm sick of the cutbacks.
I mean, how can they ask us
to do this with five people?
Yeah. You want to clamp that?
Ah, that's good Miss Chen.
Heart came early.
Yeah, there she is.
Thanks, Penny.
Clear.
Look at her. She's a beauty.
He's a lucky man.
Oh, by the way,
I've got two tickets
to the Knicks,
third row, tonight, Penny.
- Any interest?
- No, thanks.
What, is it
too American for you?
See where you live?
That's you. Right there.
Not that far away from
each other after all,
are we Clay?
Come with me.
I want to show you something.
Stay with me.
Just stay.
How are we doin', Penny?
He's looking good. He's stable.
What about you, Jack?
You wanna go to the Knicks tonight?
It might be good for you
to take the edge off.
I hate the Knicks.
Jesus, what is wrong
with you people?
I got third row.
Oh, shit.
Levatol, Nalapril, Digoxin.
He likes me to carry them around.
If I left it up to him,
he'd be popping 'em like M&Ms.
He could OD on
these things, you know?
Can't say I'll miss them.
A lot of cute purses I haven't
been able to use over the last year.
I didn't know you did that,
that you carried his meds around.
I tried not to like him.
I honestly did.
Lilith, I know
how much he means to you.
What do you want from me, Sam?
I want you to tell him
that he's as good as his father.
I want you to tell him
that it's okay to love me,
and I want you to tell me
that it's okay to love him back.
He's already lost one parent,
he can't lose another.
He needs you.
I'm not a bad person.
I mean, if you could
just give us your blessing...
Okay, just stop talking.
Just make sure
he takes his meds and...
stop talking.
What?
He has terrible allergies,
did you know that?
Especially in the spring.
Grass and flowers...
Don't think this means
I'm going to be visiting every week.
Okay. Okay, let go.
All right.
Still sleeping like a baby.
Okay, why don't you
take your break, Larry?
We've been at this for a while.
They've got a soda machine
in the waiting room.
Really? 'Cause I do
have to make a call.
Sure, go ahead,
you've got at least 20 minutes.
We don't need you for a while.
Well, thanks, guys.
Sure.
Thanks a lot.
Pickups. Need adrenaline.
Peanut.
Hey, if you need somebody
to go with you tonight,
to the game...
Thanks, Larry.
Jack?
What's the matter?
You all right?
I don't know if I can do this.
What is the problem?
Fitzpatrick is the problem.
He screwed us.
This guy's been watching everything I do.
Oh, come no, Jack. Larry's an idiot.
He doesn't know
what's going on here.
No, it's like he's
been sent here to spy on us.
I think they found out we've been pushing
Clay down the donor list.
Did you smell his breath, Jack?
He's not a spy, he's a drunk.
He's probably in there right now
in the bar topping himself...
Hey, would you just be quiet?
He could be back any second.
Okay, then go stand guard.
Go on. Now! And find out
what happened to Fitzpatrick...
Hey, Jack, do not get paranoid.
No one knows.
I started this thing,
and I swear to you I will end this.
I am not going to jail.
No one's going to jail.
Look, let's inject the heart, put it in,
and end this thing, okay?
Nobody's on to anything.
We are in... the... clear.
We're gonna kill this guy,
and then we're gonna go get
a fucking martini, okay?
By the time Larry walks back in here,
he'll be toes up
on the slab downstairs.
He knows something's going on.
I just wanna be on bypass
before Larry gets back.
You get no arguments there.
...is if we suddenly
stopped the procedure.
I'm not doing this by myself.
I'm telling you,
if this thing goes sour,
if this guy looks like he's
figuring something out,
I'm pulling the plug
on this whole thing so quickly.
I'm not kidding, Eugene.
Hey, will you help me
with these stitches, please?
I'm too young to go to jail right now.
This ain't even worth it.
We're fine, Jack...
Do you know how many
bullshit malpractice lawsuits
there are in this country?
Hard-working doctors, that's just...
You know how many I got?
- Four.
- Yeah, I know.
All for trying to
save people's lives.
It's a disgrace.
I'm sorry.
They called me out of nowhere.
I'll make it up to you, I promise.
Mm-hmm.
You know what? I'm gonna try
and find out what's going on.
- Yeah.
- Okay?
Sit tight. I'll be right back.
Hi. Excuse me.
I was wondering
if you knew the status
on the heart transplant patient?
Mr. Beresford?
Yeah.
I'll call you back.
He's doing just fine.
We're taking
good care of him. Don't worry.
Everything's going according to plan.
Really?
I just came from there.
What is it?
You're not a doctor at this hospital.
I mean, you don't work here, do you?
I'm Dr. Larry Lupin.
Pleasure to meet you.
Mr. Beresford's anesthesiologist.
Will you excuse me a minute?
Fitzpatrick got laryngitis.
They called me in from St. Matthews.
Oh.
I thought Fitzpatrick
was gonna be here.
Yes, me, too,
but we have Larry now.
The players may have changed,
but the game is still the same.
God, look how fucking obvious.
I understand.
This is Dr. Puttnam.
Pleasure. How's the patient doing?
Okay.
Everything all right?
I don't get it, Jack.
Why?
Is she asleep?
Oh, no, no. Everything's fine.
Just, um, just give her a kiss for me,
and tell her I'll be home soon.
Good. Thanks.
Say that again.
Wife!
What'd I ever do to you?
What did she do to you?
Huh?
How the fuck
could you do this to us?
What are you doing in here?
I wanted to see how it was going.
Sam.
How's it going? Is everything okay?
Yeah.
Sam.
They're trying to kill me.
I just had an interesting chat
with some guy named Larry.
Everything's fine.
You shouldn't be in here.
No, don't trust him, baby.
He's lying to you.
Are you sure everything's fine?
There is nothing wrong.
Everything's under control.
Bullshit.
What the hell's going on in here?
That's right. Come on, baby.
Where the fuck is Fitzpatrick?
I just spoke to him.
He's at home.
What do you mean, he's at home?
- He's backing out.
- He's backing out?
What?
He can't back out.
Do you want me to call him back?
No, he's an idiot.
We'll deal with him later.
What about this Larry guy?
Does he have a clue?
None. What about her?
Are you kidding?
She's ready to adopt me.
Everything's fine.
Everything is fine, right?
Right?
Jack, you okay?
Jack?
Get her a gown.
What about Larry?
I'll watch for him. Just hurry.
Guys, finish putting him on bypass.
Jack.
It was my idea, Sam. You know?
Jesus.
I can pull the plug if I want to.
Everything is working, Jack.
Okay?
There he is.
- I got him to marry me.
- The man of the hour.
The hard part's over.
This is Dr. Puttnam. Sam.
Sam, I've heard a lot about you.
Sorry, I'm late.
I had a hard time getting a sitter.
Penny Carver.
Pleasure to meet you.
Nice to meet you, too.
Sorry about him.
I'm used to it by now.
So...
How the hell do they all know her?
We didn't waste a year of our lives
for nothing, did we, Jack?
Nobody knows I worked your team.
I changed my name.
We're clear.
We're totally in the clear.
Yeah, they're all mine.
Kind of depressing to know that
your whole life can just fit on one wall.
My dream is to one
day fill up this one.
Jack, you know how much
we owe from the lawsuits.
The insurance won't cover it.
I can't just kill him, Sam.
This is our only way out.
Without this money, we're finished.
He has to die.
I am fucked.
It's just money, Sam.
I'd rather stay in debt than go to jail.
Jesus, Jack.
Grow some fucking balls.
Hey, I started this
whole thing, remember?
He landed on my table, I brought you in,
I brought all y'all in.
It's my choice.
And I wasn't the one that nearly
screwed this whole thing up, was I?
He's right, you know.
I would've had that ring on my finger
in two months.
Really?
Well, if you hadn't got knocked up,
maybe you would've had
the chance, wouldn't you?
Just go, Penny, all right?
Jack, think about it.
No more triple shifts.
No more 30-hour days.
Even if we settle the will, we're rich.
You know what
He's a transplant patient, Jack.
They all die eventually.
Yeah.
They all die eventually.
Look at me.
This isn't about her.
I'm so sorry.
I'm not risking your life
on some second-rate doctor.
He's my friend, Mother. I trust him.
I really wish
you'd start trusting me.
Quickly. Watch the vein.
All right, it's almost there.
I got it.
All right, I need some suction.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Please, God, no.
- Just get that side, too.
- Okay.
Oh, no, please, God.
No.
Aah!
It's right here.
Thank you.
You sure Larry's not close?
We're fine. Don't worry.
We gotta hurry all the same, okay, Jack?
Let's just keep it moving.
All right, just pass over the new heart.
What?
Pass over the new heart.
But we haven't injected it yet.
Pass it over.
What are you doing?
Where's the syringe?
Give it to me.
Come on.
Move your fucking hand.
Now, I want you to take this.
Inject the heart,
and put it in the body, okay?
You led us here.
Finish what you started.
Just do it, Jack.
Let's get this over with.
Sorry, baby.
He really loved you, Sam.
He didn't even know me, Jack.
We never even met.
Wait. Hold on.
Holy shit.
Oh, holy shit.
Is he okay?
Is everything okay?
They wouldn't say.
You were gone so long.
- I know.
- I started...
I know.
I'm scared, too.
Hey, guys.
Survive without me?
So far, so good. Smooth sailing.
Forceps.
Oh, you guys are flying.
- Yeah.
- Watch your flow.
Larry. Larry, Larry.
Look at my eye.
Come on, man. Can you see that?
Why am I crying, huh?
Something's wrong.
Larry. Larry, look.
Come on, man. Look at my eye.
Come on, Larry, look!
Pull it back so I can see...
- Hold on.
- All right, here we are.
- Okay.
- Clamp that.
- Get me the suction.
- All right.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Hold on. Hold on.
Yeah. Yeah.
You got it. Come on.
I'm sorry, I can't
go to the game tonight.
My old lady and I have a date.
You f...
Why don't I give you both tickets?
-  Really?
-  Sure.
You can take your old lady.
Make a night of it, go out on the town.
Something's wrong.
I can feel that something's wrong.
What is it?
I can't just sit here like this.
They should have told us something by now.
- Listen to me.
- No, you don't understand.
He's not just my son.
I was a kid when I had him.
He's going to be fine.
We've grown up together.
It's me and him.
He's not going to die.
Not now, not today.
He's going to live.
How can you be so sure?
Because he's got too much to live for.
Well, I've got a big
Halloween party tonight,
but how about
I sneak out afterward?
What's wrong with right now?
Well, I can't. I'm...
I know it's daylight
and all, but I missed you.
You look beautiful, Sam.
- I do?
Yeah, you do.
I should tell you that more often.
Heart's in.
All right, pressure down.
Pressure down.
Okay, release the clamp.
Cross-clamp released.
Wait a minute.
Wait, wait, wait.
Something's wrong.
Okay, re... re-clamp.
He's... He's fibbing.
You getting anything?
- Nothing.
- All right, all right.
Charge paddles n... now.
Come on. Now, Penny. Hurry.
You know, you really
shouldn't smoke these things.
It's not good for you.
Especially with your condition.
- My condition?
- Yep.
How do you know
about my condition?
I know a lot more
about you than you think.
- Is that a fact?
Of course.
Was I looking at you?
I hope you're happy, Sam.
And I hope you get what you deserve.
Got nothing?
- Okay.
- Paddles to 20.
- Amio's running.
- Charge.
-
- Charge it again.
-
-  Charge.
Are your lats okay?
Charge it to 40, please.
-  Jack.
- Jesus.
Charge it one more time, please.
Just charge it one more time.
Charge.
-
- Marry me.
What?
- Marry me.
- It's the middle of the night.
We're losing him.
We gotta get him back on bypass.
No, no, no, not yet.
Just one more time.
It's over, Jack. He's done.
We have to put him back on...
What about the adrenaline?
It won't make a difference.
A shot of adrenaline, please.
Please!
Come on, you son of a bitch.
Jack.
- Sure there's no air?
- No air.
I'm looking at it.
There's no air.
It's over, Jack.
Shit.
I'm sorry, Jack.
It's my fault.
No.
It's my fault.
Jack, come on.
No, it is. It's...
There's gotta be
something I could have done,
something I could have tried.
Jack, you did everything
you could do.
Did I?
You did all you could do, Jack.
It was a bad heart.
We should tell the family.
Any volunteers?
I'll do it.
I'm the one that should
be talking to them.
- I'll go with him.
- Yeah.
Thank you.
So?
He rejected the heart.
We did everything
we could, but the...
the organ failed, and I am so sorry.
The organ failed?
Yes. It wouldn't respond
to the procedure.
But in cases like this,
it's not uncommon for...
Don't you mean you failed?
No, we...
we did everything that we could.
It's just an imperfect procedure.
Say it.
Say what?
I want to hear you say it.
I want to hear you say...
you failed my son.
It shouldn't have been you.
It should never have been you.
I fucking knew it.
I'm... I'm sorry, Sam.
Um...
I'm afraid we're going
to need your permission
to take him off bypass.
What?
We'll need your permission.
I'm so sorry to have to ask.
I don't understand.
He's alive?
Yes, but his blood's being
pumped by a machine.
He has no heart.
Then get him another heart.
You don't understand.
His blood type's too rare.
We don't have one.
I'm sorry. It's... It's over.
Thank you.
I'll be in the hallway.
Lilith...
Could you leave me
alone for a minute?
Okay.
It's done.
Okay.
Hey.
Hey.
What are you doing?
Hey.
Just wanted to see
if you needed anything.
Wanted to see how you were doing.
I know it's hard to even think about
anything else right now, but...
Are you okay?
You okay?
What are you doing here?
I wasn't staying
out there without you.
She's in here somewhere.
Look around.
God damn it.
Bailey, call the code.
It's too late.
All right,
let's prep her for surgery.
I don't understand.
You're going to live, Clay.
Think I'll take it from here, Jack.
It's too late.
We did everything we could,
but the body rejected the heart.
Well, I think we solved that problem.
I have a strong heart, Clay.
Let's go.
Let's prep her for transplant.
Always have.
You can go.
We've been prepped.
What do you mean?
You can run.
Police will be here soon.
What'd you use, Jack?
Formaldehy... No, wait.
Adriamycin.
Right.
Less residue.
Guys.
Jack, come on. Let's go.
Jack, what are you doing?
Let's go. Now, Jack.
What the hell happened to you?
I told you not to trust them.
I don't get it.
You're telling me that you knew?
No, no. Not at first.
I had no idea.
She did everything right.
And then, she made one little mistake.
She left her purse in the waiting room.
Forget ethics.
You got five minutes.
You know where I'll be.
I don't trust anyone else.
It has to be you.
The mail, Clay.
She still had her mail.
Wait. Jonathan?
Haven't I see you around?
Only took me a second to put it together.
Sometimes you have
to hold the button down
for a while to get it to work.
She'd been to that hospital before.
You're not a doctor at this hospital.
I mean, you don't work here, do you?
It's a pleasure to meet you.
Why didn't you just say something?
There was no time.
You were dying, you needed a heart.
I had no choice.
Get a DLP vent ready.
Doctor, how does he look?
Terrible.
He's been on bypass too long.
Let's prep the new organ.
Still going to attempt transplant?
Well, I might
have to do an autopsy.
Give me a knife and a flat vent.
Sorry, Lilith.
I'm so sorry.
I'm looking for it.
Okay, here we go. Here we go.
Beresford transplant...
operating room B.
Becky, it's me.
Listen, get her up
and get her dressed now.
I'm coming back.
Becky, just do it, okay?
My car is downstairs.
Doctor?
Larry.
You're not going to believe what...
Over here!
Stop! Hands up!
Ah!
Give me the heart.
Heartbeat in position.
Get a 3-0 ready.
No, no, no. It's too fast.
- What if...
- I'll do the worrying.
Here, watch that clamp.
Pick up stitch.
Come on, come on.
Load the Milrinone.
Just give me time. We need to move.
Come here.
- What the fuck is going on?
- Relax.
Look, what did I tell you?
I told you I was going
to look after you, didn't I?
You trusted me this far,
so just keep quiet.
I almost forgot.
I've had this way too long
to leave this behind.
Three-one.
Wet his hands.
John, we're running out of time.
We're almost there.
We're almost there.
Scissor.
Cut.
Head down, pressure down.
Cross clamp off.
- We got rhythm.
- Looks good.
I can't go with you.
What?
They want you.
You're the one who
injected the heart, not me.
They don't want me.
Sam.
I'm sorry.
I'm just the grieving
widow, remember?
I didn't do anything wrong.
- Yeah, you did.
- No!
Going to be kind of hard
to play a grieving widow
with your fingerprints
all on the syringe.
Jack.
Jack, come on.
Let me in.
Jack.
Come on.
Please?
Goddamn you.
Open the fucking door.
Open the door now!
Jack, please!
-
- Open the fucking door.
Bye, Sam.
Jack!
Closing the chest. Pressure okay?
No Vicryl.
Sop it wet.
Yeah.
Scissor, please.
Cut.
Great job.
Well, we do what we can.
Amazing.
God damn it.
- He's in fib.
- Shit.
Get me an amp of eppy now.
Clay.
Come on, Clayton.
I'm trying to be a hero here.
Don't make me look bad.
I'm going to stay here with you.
There's no one left
for me out there anyway.
You don't need anyone else.
You do it yourself, Clay.
- You're strong.
- I'm not him.
I tried, Mom.
Really, I did, but...
I'm just not him.
He's still in fib.
- Clay.
- Never going to be.
-  Charge the paddles.
- I don't want you to be.
We're losing him.
Clear.
Come on.
I have to show you something.
I don't want to see this.
I'm afraid you have to.
I am remembering.
I'm watching the TV.
What do you want from me?
No, you're not. Look.
-
-
You're listening.
...are we going to talk about this, Lilith?
How many fucking times?
I don't want to remember anymore.
- Jesus, don't you ever shut up?
-  You never did.
I gotta get the fuck out of here.
This is bullshit.
This is just
my imagination, that's all.
Just watch.
Come on, Clayton. Come on.
-  No change.
- Give me 300.
Start mixing amio.
- Clayton, come on.
- Charge.
Clear.
Daddy?
Hey! Hey! Stop talking.
Dad.
All right, I heard you the first time!
Come on, Clayton. It's Christmas.
Put it on.
Ah!
- Daddy, please!
- Fucking bitch. Jesus!
Don't you two ever shut up?
This is what you want, Lilith, isn't it?
Huh? How's this look?
This make you happy?
Daddy, please!
All right. That's it!
Please leave him alone.
Couldn't keep your mouth shut,
could you, Clay?
- Clayton.
- Come here.
- Please.
- Come here!
- Clayton!
- Come here!
I said leave him alone.
- Still in fib.
- Give me 360.
- We lost him.
- No. Again.
- 360.
- Clear.
You didn't want to remember, Clay.
I let you forget
because I thought the truth
would be too hard to live with.
I thought I was protecting you.
But all I did
was cause you more pain.
I am so sorry.
I'm not proud
of what I became, Clay,
but I am proud
of what you've become.
You're a hundred times
the man he was.
You always were.
It's time for you to live.
Clayton...
Stop.
We got him.
Welcome back, Clayton.
Welcome back.
