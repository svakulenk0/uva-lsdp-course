Come on.
Welcome home.
That's it !
l think that's Heavenly Haven.
- ln your dreams, buddy.
- Yeah, Heavenly--
Starting descent

Take caution in this sector.
There is a citizen riot in progress.
Have a nice day.
lt's better than prison.

Eat recycled food

Be kind and peaceful to each other.
Eat recycled food.
Recycled food. lt's good for
the environment and okay for you.
Hey...
look what l got !
Little cupcake.
What have we got here ?
Are you a Judge spy, little man ?
Me... a spy ?
This guy is funny.
No, no, no.
l, l live here.
l mean, l'm gonna live here, if l live.
Maybe l should go to a hotel ?
No way, man !
Don't you hear 'em out there ?
lt's block war, man !
- Block war.
- Yeah.
Just like an Academy simulation
right down to the cross fire.
- l'll lead off. You follow.
- This is no sim, rookie !
We'll stand down
and wait for backup.
Hershey and Brisco in position
outside Heavenly Haven !
We're under fire
from the upper floors. Request backup.
Cell ''B'' in Heavenly Haven,
on the corner of Abbott and Costello.
Request backup.
Holy crud !
He's a sitting duck out there.
He knows what he's doing.
l am... the Law !
Drop... your weapons !
These blocks...
are under... arrest !
This is
your final warning !
That's Judge Dredd, man !
Hey ! You wanna be afraid of somebody ?
Be afraid of me !
l got it ! Why don't l
run down there and surrender ?
Sort of throw 'em off guard !
Bad idea.
Hey, Dredd !
Come and get us !
- l knew they'd do that.
- Judge Dredd, take cover !
They're firing .20 millimeter
caseless flechette rounds at 300 meters.
The effective lethal range
is 200 meters.
You're safe. What are you doing
down there, Judge Hershey ?
Waiting for backup.
lt's here.
Let's move it out.
Keep it simple. Single file.
Standard relay.
l'm point. You're last.
- Grenade.
-  Grenade.
-  Nice shot, sir !
- You two meet me on the 40th.
Hey, you need to get
some more ammo !
Be kind and peaceful to each other.
Eat recycled food.
Hey, you guys with us ?
Yeah ! All right !
Let's rock 'n' roll !
Dredd !
This room
has been pacified.
- Next one's mine !
- No ! Rookie, hold on !
This room
is under arrest !
No !
Die, Judges ! Die !
You're under arrest. Throw down
your weapons, and prepare to be judged !
Judge this,
Lawgiver man !
- No, don't ! They're booby-trapped.
-  lntruder.

And code 3613:

Court's adjourned.
Violence struck again in
Mega City tonight, taking a deadly toll.
Fifty-three hospitalized,
five of them children. Nineteen dead.
You got him ?
Bring him up. Okay. Now, just turn--
The other way. You got him ?
Damn it !
l was supposed to be
watching out for him.
Don't blame yourself, Hershey.
He made the mistake, not you.
Wouldn't it feel good to have
an emotion once in a while, huh ?
Emotions. There oughta be
a law against them.
- Eat recycled food.
- Halt !
lt's good for the environment,
and okay for you.
Please make your selection.
lnsert your credit in the slot.
- You have five seconds to surrender !
- Dredd, it's just a servo-droid.
- The servo-droid is your friend.
Please let your friend go by.
- Five. Four.
- Three. Two.
- You are in the way of the servo-droid.
- One !
- Boy, am l glad to see you !

Willful sabotage of a public droid.
That's six months, citizen.
Let's see your Unicard.
Come on, give me a break,
Judge... Dredd. Dredd ?
- God !
- Ferguson, Herman. Hacker.
lllegal tampering with city droids,
computers, cash machines, taxi robots--
And you haven't even been out of jail
for 24 hours. He's habitual, Hershey.
Automatic five-year sentence.
How do you plead ?
- Not guilty ?
- l knew you'd say that.
Five years ? No ! No !
l... l had no choice.
- They were killing each other.
- You could've gone out the window.
- 40 floors ? lt would've been suicide.
- Maybe... but it's legal.
- Judges ?
- Yes, sir ?
- What ?
Five years. Aspen Penitentiary.
Case closed. Take him away.
Don't close the case.
You're misjudging me ! Open the case !
You're not going to be able
to sleep tonight.
He might've been telling
the truth, you know.
Haven't you ever heard of
extenuating circumstances ?
l've heard it all, Hershey.
l knew you'd say that.
My fellow Judges, have we forgotten
the lessons of history ?
My fellow Judges, have we forgotten
the lessons of history ?
However quickly these
block wars can be contained,
it's clear that
they're becoming an epidemic;
an epidemic that should
be dealt with... immediately.
The only solution
is a tougher criminal code.
Our situation gets worse
every day.
sectors in the last two months alone.
Violent crime is rising
at 15°/o every quarter.
lf we don't increase
our resources,
they will be inadequate
in less than three years.
Three years ?
Our resources are inadequate now !
My fellow Council members,
as a city
we continue to grow,
and growth is painful.
Sixty-five million people living in
an area designed for no more than 20 !
lt's not enough
that they rely on us...
for food, clothes, water,
clean air--
Chief Justice,
the city is in chaos !
For social order,
we need tighter reins.
lncarceration hasn't worked
as a deterrent.
l say we expand execution
to include lesser crimes !
My fellow Judges,
l was barely in my teens
when l put on this badge.
When the time comes for me
to take it off,
please let me do so knowing that
it still stands for freedom...
and not for repression.
-
-  53 hospitalized.
Nineteen dead, four of them
killed by a gang of squatters...
who were themselves killed
in summary executions by Judge Dredd.
As my special undercover
report continues,
l will take you behind the
scenes at the Halls of Justice...
for a disturbing probe into
these recent riots and block wars.
Coincidence...
or deliberate ?
Dredd !
Dredd !
Some people think working these mean
streets has a dehumanizing effect on--
- Joseph.
- Chief Justice Fargo.
You may stand at ease,
Joseph.
So, tell me. Seven summary executions.
Were they necessary ?
Unavoidable, sir.
Unavoidable.
Life doesn't mean much
to some people anymore.
- You'd see that if you weren't always--
- lf l weren't what ?
Always at the Academy,
sir.
Oh ! Don't you mean,
at the Academy wiping cadets' asses ?
That's what they say
in the squad room, isn't it ?
lt's irrelevant.
You set the standard, sir.
Now you do...
at least to many young cadets.
You're a legend.
Sir.
You remember your days
as a cadet, Joseph ?
l remember what
you taught me, sir.
You were my finest student.
So, l've drawn
a new assignment for you.
Starting tomorrow, you're going to
spend two days a week at the Academy.
l'd be honored, sir.
narmed combat or marksmanship ?
Ethics.
Wait here.
Remain still. ldentify yourself.
Miller. Warden.
Voice sample recognized.
Thank you, Warden. System disarmed.
Why are you here ?
Did you come for another chat ?
Just a short one, l'm afraid.
Duty calls.
Ah, duty !
Feeding these parasites here
at the public's expense ?
Yeah.
You especially !
l don't cost anything.
l'm a ghost.
And we're both
prisoners here.
You're behind your desk...
and l'm behind this.
What a clever reward
from Fargo, huh ?
l mean,
considering the services.
When you started killing
innocent people, Rico,
you went beyond service.
The innocent exist only until they
inevitably become perpetrators...
like you.
Guilt and innocence...
is a matter of timing.
Your--
Our mysterious benefactor...
has sent you a package.
Deactivate shield.
Autoguns only.
Autoguns reactivated, Warden Miller.
Hmm.
-  What is that ?
- lt's an ancient puzzle...
that contains
the meaning of life.
So, tell me, Rico,
what is the meaning of life ?
lt ends.
Stop ! Computer!
Activate alarm !

Malfunction.
Hmm ?
Yours if you can
ever get it to work.
All of these things
you see here are toys.
At the end of the day
when you're all alone in the dark,
the only thing that counts...
is this: the Law.
And you will be alone
when you swear to uphold these ideals.
For most of us,
there's only death in the streets.
For the few of us
that survive to old age,
the proud loneliness
of the Long Walk.
A walk that every Judge
must take...
outside these city walls...
into the unknown
of the Cursed Earth.
And there spend
your last remaining days...
taking law to the lawless.
This is what it means
to be a Judge.
This is the commitment
l expect.
Class dismissed.
Attention all personnel.
Due to the recent disturbance
in Heavenly Haven,
there will be increased patrols
in Sector 4.
Please check with your commanders
to see if you are affected...
by these scheduled changes.
l can hear you thinking.
l caught your lecture today.
ls that really what you
think the cadets need to hear ?
- What l told them is the truth.
- Your truth maybe.
You made it sound like our lives
are practically over.
Don't you think...
parts are, Hershey ?
l have a personal life.
l have friends.
You're one of the smartest
of the new breed,
but you've only been
on the street a year.
You haven't gotten used to
the isolation yet.
No. No,
l don't think that's right.
No one is supposed
to be alone all the time.
l mean, is that really what
it's been like for you ?
Don't you ever--
Haven't you ever had a friend ?
Yes. Once.
What happened ?
Dredd, wait.
l want to know.
What happened ?
l judged him.
Aspen shuttle has completed off-loading.
- Cargo and morgue shipments from Aspen.
- Okay.
Let's get outta here.
Get your nose filters !
Get your nose filters !
Please select your fantasy now
and enjoy.
...who were themselves killed...
in summary executions
by Judge Dredd.
As my special
undercover report continues,
l will take you behind the scenes
at the Halls of Justice.
We're closed for the night.
You're holding a package for me.
The code name is Lazarus.
l'll just be a second.
You got a nice place.
Yeah.
A lot of this is antiques.
l thought they destroyed all these
A.B.C. warriors during the last war.
Well, you can
still collect 'em...
as long as they're nonfunctioning...
like my wife.
-
- These must be 50 or 60 years old now.
Anyway...
there you go.
- Hey, wait a second ! Don't touch it.
- Why is that ?
lt's a Lawgiver. That's programmed
to only recognize a Judge's hand.
You touch that,
it'll take your arm off.
Gee... how do you like that ?
l must be a Judge.
Happy birthday.
Status ?
Bodyguard.
- Commander ?
- Rico.
- Mission ?
- Mission ? We're going to war.
War.
l followed up some grumblings
confirming a suspicion of mine.
The cancer of oppression
goes far deeper than the Street Judges.
- You're going to say that over the air?
- lt's the truth!
- Oh, Vardas, you're insane.
- l'm a reporter.
They're never going to let
this get onto the air.
Something like this could
bring down the Council.
Maybe it should. The whole system
is the problem, not just Judge--
Dredd. No !
Judge Hershey, corner of
Burns and Allen. Level ''D.''
Possible D..l.
May need assistance.
Here we go !
- Step out of the car, please.
- What the hell's the problem now ?
Get out of the car !
nicard, please.
Did you hear me ?
nicard !
Mr. Souza. You have
a suspended license.
- You've got three counts of
driving under the influence.
- Hey, you better listen.
l suggest you walk away
and bother somebody else.
When l said l have powerful friends,
l mean powerful !
- Are we having a problem, Hershey?
- Not at all. Nothing l can't handle.
Suspended license.
Three D..l.'s.
This is getting boring.
Okay, so what's the tab ? C'mon.
How much is this going to cost me ?
You name your price.
Hershey, call Control
for an H-wagon.
What ? l don't believe it.
You're going to tow me ?
Towing is for a first offense. This
is your fourth violation, bar breath.
- You're a menace. How do you plead ?
- Not guilty.
l knew you'd say that.
- Wait a second. What are you doing ?
- Grenade.
-  Grenade.
- No !
Happy motoring.
- Subtle.
- Mm-hmm.
Judge Joseph Dredd.
Dredd,
you're under arrest.
What's the charge ?
Murder.
Attention. Chief Justice Fargo
now entering maximum security area.
- Joseph.
- Sir.
- ls it true ?
- l'm innocent.
The Council is said
to have irrefutable proof.
Do you believe that ?
There is to be
a full tribunal.
- A conviction means death.
- Do you believe that, sir ?
l just needed to look
into your eyes for myself.
l'm sorry l asked.
l would never do anything to
disgrace you with the Council, sir.
l'll use every resource
to find out, Joseph.
Have you selected
someone to defend you ?
- Judge Hershey.
- Hershey ? Why a Street Judge ?
At the Academy, she was at the top
of her class in interpretational law.
And l trust her.
The facts will come out
at the tribunal.
l'll personally
make sure of that.
Sir ?
l'm sorry about this.
-  Dredd ! No !
-
Play back.
- Dredd ! No !
-
- Dredd ! No !
-
Play back.
Stop video. The video
you have just seen...
is prima facie evidence that
the defendant is guilty as charged.
Mark it
People's Exhibit ''A.''
Objection, Your Honor.
This video is inadmissible
as evidence.
- lf l may be given a moment to explain?
- Please do.
l have an affidavit from Nathan Olmeyer,
currently a junior at the Academy.
Cadet Olmeyer has
been acknowledged...
by every one of his instructors to be
an expert in digital and video graphics.
His affidavit states this surveillance
video is of such low definition,
no positive identification
can be made of the killer.
Your Honors,
we know that the uniform of a Judge
can be counterfeit...
and that the badge
can be duplicated,
and since neither the video
nor the audio in this presentation...
can identify the accused
in any way,
l repeat my objection to this video
being allowed as evidence in this case,
and l ask for a ruling.
Objection sustained.
The video is inadmissible.
Yes !
Shh.
Admit it, Dredd.
- What ?
- You're impressed.
- Very.
- You owe me.
- Hmm.
- Very well.
l'm therefore forced to move...
to technical information
of a critical nature.
l will need
the court's permission...
to access top-secret
documentation...
with the help of
Central Computer Bank.
You may proceed.
Central,
are you on-line ?
On-line, Judge McGruder.
l wish you to access
weapons schematic.
Describe the working of the standard
Judge's side arm, the Lawgiver Two.
Model Two is
coded to the personal D.N.A....
of the Judge using the weapon...
via the skin's contact with the grip,
a fail-safe security--
- Did you know about this ?
- No !
The D.N.A. is obtained
from my medical files,
and upgraded automatically
every time the weapon is reloaded.
Each time a round
is chambered and fired...
the projectile is tagged
with the relevant D.N.A.
Chief Justice, the defense was not
made aware of any of this information.
Judge Hershey, the prosecution
must be given time to finish.
Central, were the bullets recovered from
the bodies of Vardas and Lily Hammond...
so D.N.A. coded ?
Yes, Judge McGruder.
lt could not be otherwise.
And what was
the result of the computer check...
of the D.N.A. coding
on those bullets ?
The D.N.A. is
a perfect match for Judge Joseph Dredd.
lt's a lie !
The evidence has been falsified.
lt's impossible !
l never broke the Law ! l am the Law !
- We have no case.
- You gotta believe me !
You have to believe me.
Say it.
Your Honor...
the prosecution rests.
The Tribunal needs to confer !
What have l done ?
How could l have been so wrong?
Dredd !
Both of them homicidal.
Only this time it will be
impossible to cover up.
Chief Justice,
we carefully buried the Janus project
nine years ago...
along with Rico
and all his victims.
No one will ever learn
of your involvement.
The media knows
how close l am to Dredd.
They'll dig until
the whole truth comes out.
lt's the perfect excuse to ruin
what government we have left.
Your motives were pure.
You thought Dredd was different.
That's why you spared him.
A mistake which may bring
down the judicial system.
There is a way out,
Chief Justice.
lf you will forgive me.
The Long Walk.
That's a death sentence,
Judge Griffin. Mine.
Your retirement grants you
the power to save Dredd's life !
This gesture...
may also allow Janus
to remain a secret.
ln the charge
of premeditated murder,
this tribunal finds
Joseph Dredd...
guilty as charged.
Joseph Dredd,
you're aware the law allows
only one punishment for your crime.
Death.
However, it has long been
our custom...
to carry out the last order
of a retiring Senior Judge.
And so...
l step down.
No !
As l leave...
to take my Long Walk
into the Cursed Earth,
l ask that this court
honor my last order.
Be lenient
with Judge Dredd...
in gratitude
for his years of service.
We will so honor this one,
Judge Fargo.
Dredd, step forward.
The sentence shall be
life imprisonment...
at Aspen Penal Colony,
to be carried out immediately...
as it is written !
Justice Griffin, this trial has been
a farce ! l demand an appeal !
You will accept the court's decision,
Judge Hershey !
Dredd, l'm so sorry.
l let you down.
You did your best, Hershey.
Thank you.
Let the betrayer of the Law...
be taken from our courts.
Let his armor
be taken from him,
and all his garb of justice.
Let him be stricken from our hearts
and our memory... forever.
Let his name be recorded
in every place of honor.
Let him take the Law
he served so well...
to those who have it not.
Let him be written...
in our hearts and
our memories... forever.
Attention all Judges.
You are reminded--
Judge Hershey.
lt's gotta be here some--
What's this ?
Baby Dredd ?
l can't believe
you were ever a baby.
Who's this ?
Chief Justice Griffin.
lt's got a nice ring
to it.
We were supposed
to meet someplace safe !
What's not safe ?
Your reporter's dead, right?
Fargo's on his Walk.
Dredd's in Aspen.
So, what's not safe ?
lt's unfortunate.
Hammond had to be silenced.
He found out about Janus.
- But l could've used Dredd.
- Forget Dredd !
There is no Dredd !
Let me tell you
what Dredd worships.
He worships the Law !
He'd have blown you away the minute he
found out how much you're pissin' on it.
Yeah. Let him see what it's like
to freeze his ass off in Aspen.
Let him see what it's like
to be me !
There's a lot of work
to be done.
Janus.
Well, where is it ?
- You'll see it !
- When ?
Soon enough !
ln the meantime,
l want chaos, Rico.
That block war
was just the beginning.
Now l want fear
racing through every street !
And the Council
will have to turn to me.
And to Janus !
You want fear ?
l'm fear.
You want chaos ?
l'm the chaos.
You want a new beginning ? Here !
l am the new beginning !
This is Aspen Shuttle CF-188.
Due to storm cloud activity over the
desert, we will be flying at 60 feet.
Flight time approximately
four hours.
Dredd ? Don't hit me. l'm sorry.
l'm sorry. Don't hurt me.
What are you doing here ?
l was convicted of a crime.
Wrongly convicted.
Really ?
That's kinda weird.
What are the odds ?
Two wrongly-convicted guys
sittin' right next to each other.
You received the sentence
the Law required.
Five years...
just for saving my own ass ?
That was a mistake !
The Law doesn't make mistakes.
Really ? Then how do you explain
what happened to you ?
You can't... can you ?
Great !
Mr. ''l am the Law'' can't.
So, maybe,
this is some kind of typo.
Maybe it's a glitch.
Or maybe
it's poetic justice !
Shuttle comin' ! Shuttle !
Shuttle !
Shuttle comin', Pa !
Look !
Praise the Lord for bringing us
this generous bounty.
My sons...
gather the harvest.
So maybe you're here
as some sort of field trip.
Yeah !
Maybe this is some
sort of... surprise party.
Whoo ! Gonna catch me
some city boy !
lt's payback time, Dredd !
Dredd, what's happening ?
By a blast of God
they perish.
And by a breath of His nostrils
are they consumed.
Hallelujah !

This terminal has been
terminated from the main system.
Your authority has been removed,
Judge Hershey.
This is Group Leader.
We've located the shuttle.
This is Capture Team.
There's no sign of Dredd.
He appears to have survived the crash.
You are in error, Capture
Team. No one survived the shuttle wreck.

Just find Dredd !

He's alive.
No one survived the shuttle wreck !
Do l make myself clear ?
Yes, sir.
Am l dead ?
Am l dead ?

- Awake !
Good !
We're running out

Oh, my God !
- Dredd, do something !
- Dredd ?
You talk too much.
Can it be ?

of the Law himself.
O Lord, you have
blessed us indeed !

You creeps

ls that so ?
Let me crush him, Pa.
- Excuse me. We're not together.

Allow me to introduce you

- There's Link, my oldest.
- Bite me !
Hi !
My youngest, Junior.
- Howdy.
- Hi !
And this here is Mean.

Cursed Earth pirates,

- And, of course, scumbags.
- Oh, that'll win 'em over !
Did l leave something out,
Pa ?
- Let me kill 'im, Pa. l want his ears.
- l want his teeth.
Does that come with a fork,
handsome ?
Hallelujah, brother !
Wait a minute.
Can it be ?
Can it be that from
the city of the fallen...
- we have one of the faithful ?
- Amen, brother !
- Praise the Lord ! l'm a believer !
- Fergie, don't do it.
lt sounds like we have
a believer in the gallery.
- Yes !
- Cut him down !
- Go tell it on the mountain !
- Fergie.
You're making
a big mistake.
Well, Dredd, maybe the Law
doesn't make mistakes,
but l'm free
and you're toast.
Actually, you're toast.
l forgot to mention it.
Your new friends,
they're cannibals.
- Fresh meat.
- Prepare the supplicant for sacrifice.
No, wait.
You can't eat me !
l've got eczema. l've got warts.
l've had gonorrhea.
Eat Dredd.
He works out.
Yum, yum.
lt's been fun, Lawman.
Finish Dredd.
My pleasure, Pa.
Come on.
Come on !
Come on, Junior !
-
- Guilty !
-
- Shut up !
- Dredd, look out !
-
There's Dredd !
- Go !
-
Well, we did it.
We got 'em all.
- Hmm.
- Pussies! ls that all you got ?
They are dead, right ?
Have you been crying ?
l'm not crying.
l got something in my eye.
You ever have allergies ?
Dredd, look out !
- Chief Justice !
- Joseph, together again.
Together again, sir.
-
- No !
- God, not again !

You got three strikes,
Lawman !

You're out, Lawman !
You killed Link !

What ?
Look. lt's full of anomalies.
Really clever ones too.
Somebody must've used a C.G.l. terminal
and a scan quad to make this.
This is state-of-the-art...
twenty years ago.
Are you saying
this isn't real ?
Yeah. Look, l'll drop out
all the artificial pixels.
Dad. Mom.
Foreground.
Background.
All fake.
The only thing that's real
is the baby.
Oh. The blind lady.
Who is she ?
Justice...
before your time.
We should never have taken
justice out of her hands.
- You brought order to chaos, sir.
- That we did.
Solved many problems,
and created many more !
-
- Being a Judge, Joseph,
perhaps too much power
in one person's hands.
We once tried to compensate:
create the perfect Judge.
We called it Janus.
Four decades ago,
D.N.A. samples were taken
from the original Council.
One was chosen.
Mine.
We altered it to enhance
the best qualities...
and screen out the worst:
weaknesses, frailties.
We created you.
You didn't create me,
sir.
- l have a family.
- No.
At the Academy, you told me they
were killed when l was very young.
A lie.
l have a picture of them.
A fake.
We lied... to both of you.
Both ?
There was another infant
created in that experiment,
but something went wrong.
Genetically mutated
to the perfect criminal.
l have a brother ?
You were best friends at the Academy.
Star pupils.
And then he turned.
And for his crimes, you judged him.
Rico ?
Rico.
You let me judge my own brother ?
You never told me, sir.
l couldn't !
You were like a son to me !
A son.
My whole life is a lie.
Rico had to be executed to protect you,
to protect the city.
Rico.
Rico. He's alive!
No.
l signed the order myself.
- l saw the report.
- l didn't kill Hammond.
lt was him. lt was his D.N.A.
that convicted me.
Griffin. Hmph.
lt was Griffin.
Griffin, yes.
We've both been deceived, Joseph.
l'm so sorry.
Rico's killed me
and destroyed you !
Fi-- Find him,
Joseph.
Don't die.
What do we do ?
What do we do ?
Find Rico.
Welcome to Janus.
Rico, l think you know
Dr. Hayden.
l remember you. Testified before
the Council that l was insane, right ?
- And therefore innocent.
- l was trying to save your life.
What you did was insult me,
'cause l knew exactly what l was doing.
Then and now.
Miss Hayden has been a loyal supporter
of this project for a long time.
She's kept it alive for me. l'm sure
you'll find her expertise invaluable.
Excuse me ! All this is useless if you
can't get into Central's Janus files,
'cause the Council
has 'em locked.
Leave that to me. Meanwhile you
have work to do... on the streets.
- llsa will help you.
- l don't need no help ! Thanks.
l thought you said he was created here
by the finest scientists of Mega City.
A bold experiment.
He's a petulant child.
Let's not bicker.
We're here to achieve the same thing.
An ordered society.
You'll have
your New Order.
Attention, all Judges.
Reporting unrest, code D-924.
Downtown, Sector 12.
Backup requested.
Nineteen different
explosions in 11 different sectors.
Extra caution to be taken
on approach to 914--
Search all areas
bordering the Elite Building.
The anonymous caller did not
specify capacity. Proceed with caution.
My boy !
Dredd, there's no way in !
Hello ?
Are you even listening to me ?
We can't just knock on the wall
and say, ''Hello, Cursed Earth Pizza.''
There is a way in.
Six years ago,
two refugees figured it out.
lt's a vent to the city's incinerator.
There's a burst twice a minute.
That means somebody
could run through that tube...
and have 30 seconds
before it flames again.
And these, these refugees,
they made it through, right ?
Actually,
they were roasted.
But the theory's sound.
Shall we ?
Maybe we should
consider other theories. Dredd !
Dispatch, l'm in Green Quad 411.
Need a pickup.
Copy, Hershey.
l have Central on-line for you.
Patch it to my Lawmaster.
Warning.
Alien device on board.
Oh, my God !
Latest casualty report:
Whoever's doing this seems
to know all our procedures,
our security measures,
even our scrambled frequencies.
With no Judges on the street, riots
are breaking out all over Mega City.
We can't replace those Judges.
Even if we put the cadets on the street,
we won't be at full strength for years !
There is a solution.
Project Janus.
This Council tried to play God
once before.
lf this wholesale slaughter of Judges
continues, there won't be a Council.
- Janus could--
- Janus could what ?
A new batch of test-tube babies
won't solve this crisis.
We don't need reliable Judges
Accelerated growth incubators
are more developed now.
We could create adult subjects.
All l'm asking is that
we unlock the Janus files.
That way we at least
have an option !
lf the Council decides
not to go forward,
l'll accept that decision...
and resign.
- All right, you ready, kid ?
- No !
- Now what's wrong ?
- What's wrong ? Are you kidding ?
Did wearing that helmet all those years
compress your brain ?
- You're gonna get me killed.
- There's a maniac loose in this city !
What a coincidence !
- There's one out here too !
- Oh.
Great time l'm having. The shuttle
crash, the Cursed Earth, cannibals.
And now a fireball up my ass !
- This is all your fault !
- My fault ?
- Yes !
- You care to explain that, citizen ?
lf you hadn't arrested me,
l wouldn't be here in the first place.
Hey, Dredd, what if
you just kill me now ?
That's it !
l'm through schlepping.
l'm gonna stay here until
l'm caught or 'til you apologize !
- The Law can't apologize !
- You're not the Law anymore.
Now apologize.
l think l deserve that.
l've never apologized.
Now run !
Thirty, twenty-nine,
twenty-eight,
- twenty-seven, twenty-six,
- Run !
twenty-five, twenty-four,
twenty-three, twenty-two,
twenty-one, nineteen--
Dredd ? Dredd !
Dredd !
l don't wanna die !
Jump !
l'm alive !
l'm alive !
Oh... so are you.
Esposito, Carlos.
Council Judge.
Authorize access to file,
code name Janus.
Acknowledged.
McGruder, Evelyn. Authorize
access to file, code name Janus.
Acknowledged.
Silver, Gerald.
Authorize access to file,
code name Janus.
Removing security blocks now.
Awaiting password command
from presiding Chief Justice.
Password, origin.
Janus file opened.
Attention.
ntil emergency repairs are completed,
Ward ''C'' locker room
is off limits.
Psst.
l'm lost.
ls this the bathroom ?
Hey !
Now you have to admit,
l helped out on that one.
l mean,
that was all me, baby !
Hey, hey, wh--
Why are you taking off his clothes ?
We don't have time
for this.
Central,
using current technology,
how long would it take for Janus to
produce a fully-grown adult subject ?
Given the current state
of genetic engineering,
an adult subject could be incubated
in approximately eight hours.
- We could replace our losses in a day.
- This is madness.
Ah, Dredd ?
- Silence.
- Dredd !
Shh. l'm busy.
Dredd ?
lt's inhuman.
lt's not for this Council to play God !
No, Griffin.
Please restore the security blocks.
lt seems none of you have the force
of will that these times require.
Central,
leave Janus unlocked.
Griffin, this is treason.
You have just sealed your fate.
No !
You have just sealed yours !
Rico !
Now who says
politics is boring ?
- Hey, Dredd ! l thought it was you.
-
That's right !
Cover your ears !
- Rico.
- Joseph.
Get out of here... now !
No !
- You're under arrest, Griffin.
- Really ?
Stop him ! He just killed
the entire Council !
- Move it out !
- Dredd, tell them l'm innocent.
Come on, Fergie !
Run !
You're a lot of fun to be with, Dredd.
You know that ?
- What are you gonna do ?
- Hope it works.
What is wrong
with this piece of shit ?
-
-
That's a solid brick wall !
You're going to kill us !
Dredd !
You gotta make it work !
Make it work !
Malfunction.
Malfunction. On-line.
Dredd, you may want to wash this seat
after we get off the bike.
- Hmm.
- Sorry.
Dredd, move it !
- Fergie, cover the rear.
- l've never fired a gun in my life !
- What kind of a criminal are you ?
- A nice criminal.
- Nothing's happening !
- You gotta cock it first, moron.
You didn't say anything
about cocking.
Nice !
Stop ! Please, God !
You can drop me off here.
- Dredd, that's a dead end.
- l know.
Oh, God !
Fergie, take over !
Where are you going ?
Dredd !
- This is where you get off, creep !
-
-
- Need a lift, kid ?
l'm never riding
with you again, Dredd !
She's definitely not gonna get her
cleaning deposit back, that's for sure.
lt doesn't pay to be
one of your friends, Dredd. Sorry !
Hands against the wall.
You know the drill.
- Who are you ?
- Dredd said that--
Shut up !
- What happened ?
- Why don't you tell me, Dredd, huh ?
We're dyin' out there !
What the hell is going on ?
You think l'm part of this ?
l don't know
who or what you are anymore.
l would never do anything
to hurt you, Hersh.
You know that.
All right.
You tell me about him,
huh ?
You make me believe in you
like l did when l defended you.
His name is Rico...
and he's my brother.
The D.N.A. sample
has been taken out of frozen stasis.
- Ready for cloning process.
- We got a slight change of plans here.
l want to take the existing
D.N.A. sample right now and trash it.
Activate this
D.N.A. sampling console.
What are you doing ?
Central, take...
this D.N.A. sample now.
This wasn't part
of our plan !
Judge Griffin would never
have authorized this !
Processing.
You know, Griffin got to be my keeper
by puttin' me behind bars.
What's your excuse ?
You said l had no feelings
and no emotions.
Now you know why.
Dredd... look at me.
The Janus project didn't do that to you.
You did that to yourself.
Sorry, guys, l'm getting
nowhere with your terminal.
But l fixed the microwave.
You want some popcorn ?
ls this a bad time ?
Look, l tried dialing everything l
could think of to find this Janus thing.
lt just isn't in the program.
Nowhere. Nothing.
They'd never take a chance and
put it on the computer network...
but they need power and they're
gonna steal it from somewhere.
Check every sector for recent blackouts
and sudden power surges.
- Great. Let's stay here longer !
- Wait a second.
Just before they blew up
my Lawmaster in Sector Four,
there was a power surge,
a really big one, three blocks wide.
The last time l felt
something like that,
they shut down the whole power grid
in that area, remember ?
When they moved the Statue of Liberty,
they put it right down on top of it.
- Right.
- Could we go now ?
Dredd...
that's twice you owe me.
Rico ! Dredd got away
from the hunters.
Well, he's about to be
seriously outnumbered.
- Right, Central ?
-  Affirmative, Judge Rico.
The new D.N.A. sample
has been multiplexed,
and the gametes
are already dividing.
New sample ?
You left that D.N.A.
in there for over 30 years !
Sooner or later, somebody's
gonna clean out the fridge.
That sample was created from the finest
specimens on the Council of Judges !
What did you
replace it with ?
No. My God.
You should congratulate me right now,
'cause l'm about to be a daddy.
You're being
very, very rude.
You don't know
what you're doing !
The next batch of Janus Judges are not
going to be the puppets that you want !
They're gonna be my brothers
and sisters ! And mine to control !
l can't let you do this.
You're both insane ! l have to stop--
Central... help me !
l'm sorry, Chief Justice,
the A.B.C. robot...
is not tied
into my main processor.
That's right, Griff. You gotta
get with this high-tech stuff.
- Robot, rip his arms and legs off.
- No !
And you save his head for last.
l don't want him to miss anything !
- Anything !
- No !
- Fergie, you stay here.
- By myself?
You'll need me to shut down
the Janus system. We're a team.
Granted, you do most of the work,
but we're still a team.
- l'll handle it, kid.
- l bring you luck.
- Luck ?
- You are still alive, Dredd.
Hmm.
-
- l'm getting a signal.
lt's close.
lt's moving closer !
Jesus Christ !
Get back !
No !
Dredd !
Drop the gun.
Robot, on the count of three,
break her neck.
One, two--
No !
- Hershey ?
- l'm still here.
- How romantic. Step inside.
-
He looks a lot like you.
He looks a lot like you.
He is a lot like me.
l am nothing like you.
The only difference
between us, Joseph,
is you destroyed your life...
to embrace the Law.
And l destroyed the Law...
to embrace life.
And speaking of life,
send in the clones.
Behold !
This is where you were born.
Feel that magic ?
But you must've known
all along...
you were different.
Fergie...
are you still alive ?
Technically... yes.
Your brothers
and your sisters.
Be born in two hours.
One big, endless supply
of perfection.
You know, we have a choice.
We can stand here right now...
and create a whole race of brainwashed
morons, and call them Judges.
Or we can create
some freethinking people.
We'll call them human.
Human.
You could never
control yourself.
What makes you think you
can control... these things ?
'Cause you're in control.
You be head
of the Council.
You choose,
and you choose quickly too.
l should've put you down myself...
personally !
You know,
l never understood that.
Why did you judge me ?
Why did you judge me ?
- You killed innocent people.
- The means to an end.
- You started a massacre.
- l caused a revolution.
- You betrayed the Law !
- Law !
l betrayed this !
Your Council's experiment,
which failed in you !
l was your brother,
your blood, your friend.
Who betrayed who ?
When are you gonna stop
being a goddamn slave and grow up ?
That's your birthright,
that's your family.
l'm your family.
l'm the only family you ever had !
Now choose !
The best thing you can do
is kill me.
Why ?
Because it's
your only chance... brother.
Fido !
Rip this bitch's arms
and legs off.
- Save her pretty head for my brother.
- Don't do it !
Halt !
Rip his head off instead.
Give it to her.
What's the matter with you ?
Rico !
- Boy, is he pissed !
- Fergie !
Dredd !
-  Get him, Dredd !
-  Hang on, Fergie.
Hack you, asshole.
Rico !
Central, hatch that
first set of clones.
The cloning process
is not finished, Judge Rico.
The clones will be
only 60°/o complete.
l need reinforcements.
Hatch the goddamn clones now !
Don't fight much,
do you ?
Bitch !
lt's Judge Bitch !
l'm the only one
who never lied to you.
l'll be the judge of that.
Now, Joseph Dredd,
l hereby judge you.
To the charge of betraying
your flesh... guilty.
To the charge of being human, when
we could have been Gods... guilty.
The sentence is death.
Don't miss.
Lethal round is exhausted.
Signal flare !
Court is adjourned.
Dredd.
Give me your hand.
That's three times now, Dredd.
Stay in back, Hershey.
- Am l under arrest ?
- That won't be necessary.
Central broadcast the Janus plan
after Griffin's death.
They all know the truth.
Judge Dredd, we have
to reconstitute the Council.
We'd like you to consider
the first position of Chief Justice.
l'm a Street Judge.
And l'm very late for work.
Thank you, Olmeyer.
l am dying.
l'm too young-- Excuse me.
Oh, that's great !
He gets all the credit.
Dredd ?
l taught him everything he knows.
Dredd, that's it ?
No good-bye ?
Good-bye, Hershey.
To tell you the truth,
l'm probably a much better kisser.
Ow ! Okay, come on, let's go, will ya ?
Can we swing by a cash machine ?
Feels good to be human,
don't you think ?
l knew you'd say that.
