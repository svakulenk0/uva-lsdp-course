Where have you been?
I've been waiting since 7:00.
Get in. I had to find fireworks.
Let me drive.
Get in. I haven't eaten in 24 hours.
Are you coming or not?
It's too crowded.
I thought you were starving.
Let's go someplace quiet.
Okay.
What are we doing?
Sitting. Listening to music. Talking.
- You seem weird. Is everything okay?
- Yeah, everything's fine.
It's July.
How many shirts are you wearing?
- I'm cold.
- You're cold on the Fourth of July?
Fuck off and die!
- What?
- "Fuck off and die"?
Shut up.
Was that car at the drive-in?
I saw that car at Mr. Ed's.
- Do you want me to tell him to leave?
- Stay in the car.
- Was that your husband?
- No.
Don't worry about it.
- Don't tell me not to worry. Who was it?
- It's nothing.
Let's go.
Get your wallet.
- Vallejo Police Department.
- I want to report a double murder.
May I have your name
and where you are calling...
If you go one mile east
on Columbus Parkway,
a public park,
you'll find kids in a brown car.
Spit.
- I swallowed it.
- Why?
It was minty.
You can't do that. It's not good for you.
Lunch box.
- Why am I not going on the bus?
- Because we're late.
Okay, you're staying
with your mom and Aaron tonight.
So, you don't like
having a new little brother?
- No, not really.
- Oh, that's honest.
Learn a lot.
There will be a test tonight!
Morning.
- Hi.
- Good morning.
- Morning.
- Morning.
Editorial in two.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
the draft board piece
was damn near perfect.
Mr. Graysmith.
Horrid.
Horrid.
Not so horrid.
Horrid.
I'm thinking we go with not so horrid.
Janice in Datebook left the fondue party
before everyone got naked.
That's a crime.
Have you seen her? Wouldn't kid you.
It may be the beginning of a crime wave.
You need to see this.
Go get the publisher.
"This is the murderer
"of the two teenagers
last Christmas at Lake Herman
"and the girl on the Fourth of July
near the golf course in Vallejo.
"I shall state some facts
which only I and the police know.
"Christmas,
brand name of ammo, Super-X.
"Ten shots were fired.
"The boy was on his back
with his feet to the car.
"The girl... "
"The girl was on her right side,
feet to the west.
"Fourth of July.
"One, girl was
wearing patterned slacks.
"The boy was also shot in the knee.
"Brand name of ammo was Western.
"Here is part of a cipher.
"The other two parts of this cipher
are being mailed to the editors of
"I want you to print this cipher
on the front page of your paper.
"In this cipher is my identity.
"If you do not print this cipher
by the afternoon of Fry,"
F- R-Y, "First of Aug '69
I will go on a kill rampage Fry night.
"I will cruise around all weekend
killing lone people in the night
"then move on to kill again
"until I end up with
a dozen people over the weekend. "
It's unsigned except for a symbol.
Is it me,
or does that look like a gunsight?
Today's August first.
He wants his code
in the afternoon edition.
If the Examiner doesn't have
the balls to run it, we scoop the Bay.
Al, this man is talking about
shooting 12 people.
And not running this
might make him do that.
If we run it, we might be setting
a very dangerous precedent.
Well, giving some sick bastard
a soapbox,
what does that say to people?
Back up. Is this Vallejo story true?
Do we know that?
- Paul?
- What? I cover crime in Vallejo?
Yeah, I cover crime in Vallejo.
Ten minutes.
Let's shoot the code and call SFPD.
If it turns out to be real,
at least we'll have the material.
All right.
Graysmith,
don't you have that cartoon to finish?
Hi, this is Paul Avery
from the San Francisco Chronicle.
I'm looking for someone to
shed some light on a letter we received.
Thank you.
Sergeant Mulanax.
Sergeant, Paul Avery from
the San Francisco Chronicle.
I just wanted to check
if you had an unsolved
firearm-related homicide
on Christmas and
maybe one on July fourth.
Shit.
Confirmed.
VPD, they confirmed the shootings.
They got the same letter
with a different code.
Christmas, two teenagers
on lover's lane. Both DOA.
David Faraday and Betty Jensen.
July fourth,
Darlene Ferrin and Michael...
I think it's "Mayhew. "
Anyway, he lived, she didn't.
The murder weapons?
Ballistics, everything he said
in the letters matched.
I mean, I think the Times-Herald's
gonna go with it.
The Examiner's going,
but won't go front page.
I say let's go front page.
If he kills 12 people, it's not our fault.
Robert! We need the cartoon.
- You're not finished?
- No, I'm finished, Carol. I'm finished.
Thieriot's still here.
Really?
The first edition
is off the floor in 10, Charles.
Give us a sec.
We'll go on page... Page four.
What do you say, 20 bucks
whoever cracks the psycho's name?
He won't give his name.
Morti's? Anyone?
- That's where I'm heading.
- All right.
Put those on my desk. Turn on the light.
Grab your book.
Now go get your jammies on.
The cipher's broken into three sections,
each with eight lines and 17 symbols.
No breaks between the symbols
denoting different words.
No numbers or clues
to substitution keys.
And you got symbols
from at least seven different sources.
Greek, Morse code, Navy semaphore,
weather symbols, astrological signs.
- Hey, take a gander at this code thing.
- Okay.
You wanna give it a go?
Guy who used to sit there
was a great cartoonist. Bob Bastian.
Now he's doing public television.
For some reason.
Now he's doing public television.
For some reason.
Paul Avery.
Robert Graysmith.
I've been here nine months.
You were right, by the way.
He didn't give his name.
Who cracked it?
A history teacher
and his wife in Salinas.
"I like killing people
because it is so much fun.
"It is more fun
than killing wild game in the forest
"because man is the most
dangerous animal of all to kill.
"Something gives me
the most thrilling experience.
"It is even better
than getting your rocks off with a girl.
"I will be reborn in paradise.
"And all that I have killed
will become my slaves.
"I will not give you my name
because you will try to slow down
"or stop my collecting of slaves
for my afterlife. "
Methinks our friend's
a tad bit fuckered in the head.
I heard he even sent Vallejo
a code key, just to help.
- What is that at the bottom?
- Leftovers.
Maybe an anagram.
How does one do that?
I like puzzles. I do them a lot.
How did you know
he wasn't gonna give his name?
Dangerous animal.
Dangerous animal.
What dangerous animal?
How do I know that?
- Paul.
- Yes, Templeton.
- Editorial, now.
- Very well.
Another letter.
More of the same.
Details about the murders.
He taped a flashlight to the gun.
That's how he hit them in the dark.
And he gave himself a name.
You know this used to be
the town of Montecello?
the county decided that the land
would work better as a lake.
So they flooded it.
- But there's an entire...
- Hidden city under the water.
Somebody else is here.
It is a public park.
I think he's watching us.
Where'd he go?
He went behind that tree.
All right. So he's taking a leak.
He's coming towards us.
Don't move.
- I want your money and your car keys.
- Okay.
We're gonna cooperate.
Just tell me what you want us to do.
Here.
You're welcome to everything I have.
If there's anything else
I could do for you...
Maybe I could write you a check?
Okay, I could give you
my phone number.
Even more than you might think.
He's a sociology major.
You know, I'm sorry, I don't know exactly
where I put my keys.
They might be on the blanket.
Is it okay if...
Here's the keys.
Don't get up.
I want her to tie you up.
Okay.
You know, if he comes any closer,
I might be able to get that gun.
- Don't get any ideas.
- I'm not.
I killed a guard
escaping from prison in Montana.
I'm not afraid to kill again.
Look away.
What was the name of that prison?
I'm taking your car.
I'm going to Mexico.
We didn't complain
when you tied our hands.
We have done everything
that you've asked.
It's okay. It's okay.
Get on your stomach
so I can tie your feet.
Okay.
It gets really cold out here at night.
We could freeze.
You know,
just because people are gonna ask,
was that thing even loaded?
It's okay.
This is all gonna be okay.
Dispatch, this is 43L2,
heading south on Knoxville Road.
I've got an abandoned white
VW Karmann-Ghia...
I want to report a murder.
No, a double murder.
They are two miles north
of park headquarters.
They were in a white
Volkswagen Karmann-Ghia.
Piner's ambulance
has been dispatched.
God, can you imagine
surviving something like that?
Writing the dates on the side of the car.
We got two Vallejo killings,
now there's one in Napa. Why Napa?
What the hell is he doing out of Vallejo?
Sweet mother of Christ,
what are you drawing?
Kid at the lake.
This is what he said
the Zodiac was wearing.
- Paul, what are you doing?
- Hyman, I wrote it. It's done.
Now I just got to type it up.
Type it up?
It's not finished until you type it up.
We've got to read it.
- What's that?
- That's the Zodiac at the lake.
What's the story with the kid?
He seems a little touched
or medicated or...
- Graysmith?
- Yeah, what is it?
He's a fucking boy scout.
He doesn't smoke,
he doesn't drink, he doesn't curse.
- And he's back.
- I knew it.
"Man is the most
dangerous animal of all. "
I knew that
I heard that from somewhere.
It's a movie about a Count
who hunts people for sport.
People.
- Who's that?
- That's Count Zaroff.
Zaroff? With a "Z"?
And that will be
all for the news on the 20.
We've got curfews in effect tonight
for the following counties,
Napa, Solano, Contra Costa,
Alameda, Marin, and San Mateo.
Vic in San Francisco, you're on the line.
You're not scared of the Zodiac?
Heck no,
he's only shooting those farm kids.
What scares me
is those hippies out in the Haight
You know, I think
that was really offensive.
Hey, nobody's downplaying
the loss of human life here, Alfred.
We have good solid communities
out here in the North Bay.
Unlike in the city where you have
Satanists running around.
Well, you bring up a good question.
Is the Zodiac a Satanist?
Amber from Oakland,
what do you think?
but I thought that code
they printed didn't look very Christian.
But I think the bigger problem
is that the papers shouldn't have printed
anything that the Zodiac
has been doing.
That they're just printing
all that stuff to sell more newspapers.
Well, the Zodiac did demand
they print his letters
Yeah, but he would have
done it anyway,
- San Francisco Police Department.
- Yes. There's a fight in a cab!
3398 Washington,
at the corner of Cherry.
One's drunk and
we think he's robbing him.
- Is the crime still in progress?
- Yes, please hurry.
Nuts!
Whoever this is,
you owe me a new lamp.
Cabbie's been shot
three blocks from the Presidio.
Well, it wasn't me.
I've been with my bride all night.
- She can vouch.
- Go put on the Folgers.
Let me just describe
the lamp you're gonna buy me.
- I just got to sleep.
- Suspect's Negro, male adult.
Walt's on scene, locked up the cab
and secured the crowd.
Seriously, dead asleep.
I lost feeling in my arm and everything.
Crackers.
You ever try Japanese food?
- What do you mean, like teriyaki?
- No, like the urchin.
- Raw fish.
- I'm eating here, Bill.
- I always wanted to try it.
- So, why don't you?
Haven't got around to it.
Evening, gents. What a lovely night
for a botched robbery.
Yeah, third this week.
Must be end of summer rush.
I got foot patrols going through the park,
dogs are on the way.
The victim's name is Paul Stine.
Dousette pronounced him at 10:10.
Suspect fired one shot
to the back of the head.
Driver's wallet
and car keys are missing.
How'd you know his name?
Leroy, there, came down
from Yellow Cab to ID him.
Neighborhood's pretty high-end
for this kind of thing,
so I already set up transpo for the cab.
- Coroner's here.
- Any witnesses?
Kids who called it in
saw the suspect from that window.
- Did they hear a shot?
- No.
thought he was a drunk
fighting with the driver.
Oldest kid ran downstairs to get
a better look from the dining room,
crew-cut, stocky,
and wearing a dark jacket.
Wait, I thought someone said
he was black.
That's the description
that went out to radio cars.
- We already corrected it.
- Oh, well, that's good.
- You guys need anything else?
- No. Get out of here.
Thanks. Happy Birthday.
- Wait, it's your birthday?
- Yep.
- That's great. Happy birthday.
- Thanks.
- Body or scene?
- It's your birthday, I'll take the body.
Dave, looks like he
wiped the cab down pretty good.
- We got some blood over here.
- Prints?
Could very well be.
We'll dust it at the Hall.
- Suspect's?
- There's blood on them.
- Hey, Pete?
- Yeah, Dave.
You through over there,
can I get in there?
- Who rolled him?
- Stewarts.
I got a single 9mm casing.
Nothing from the crowd.
Okay.
I'm your shooter, Negro male adult,
who also happens to be
a stocky, crew-cut Caucasian.
I flag a cab. I give him this address.
Did I give him this address?
Who's got the fare book?
Right here.
Washington and Maple.
That's one block east.
so maybe I see
someone walking their dog.
You don't want any witnesses
so you tell him to go down a block.
He pulls over.
I wait for him to put it in park
because I'm smart
and I don't want him
hitting the accelerator
when I shoot him. May I?
I shoot him on the right side,
he slumps right?
Maybe you've got your hand
on his collar when you shoot.
I just dumped a quart of blood
in the front seat.
- So, why do you get in the front seat?
- For the money.
But he's dead.
You could just reach over the seat,
pull out his wallet.
You don't have to go
anywhere near the blood.
- I'm an idiot.
- But you're not an idiot.
You waited for him to put it in park.
- Right. Thank you.
- Yeah, sure.
- Can I see that?
- Yeah.
I am an idiot.
I just killed a man for $8.25.
It's his third fare of the night.
Does anyone have any animal crackers?
- Animal crackers?
- They're in the car.
I'm saving those for later.
Fine.
- Are you a reporter?
- No, I'm Inspector Dave Toschi, SFPD.
Sir, I was wondering
if I'd be able to talk to your children,
one at a time and preferably alone?
They just saw a man murdered.
I understand.
It looked like
they were drunk and fighting.
He came around the side of the car
and he was wiping stuff.
- Did you get a chance to see his face?
- I did.
Did you remember what he looked like?
- Normal.
- Yeah.
"Normal?"
"over by Washington Street
and Maple Street last night.
"To prove this, here is
a blood-stained piece of his shirt.
"I am the same man who did in
the people in the North Bay Area.
"The S.F. Police could have
caught me last night
"if they had searched the park properly
"instead of holding road races
with their motorcicles. "
- Gentlemen.
- Dave.
Paul. Where's the shirt?
There's your rag the kids talked about.
So he got in the front seat
to tear off a piece of the shirt.
- Is this on the record?
- Well, what do you think?
He confirms
the Vallejo and Napa killings.
Gets worse.
Read the last part.
"School children make nice targets.
"I think I shall wipe out
a school bus some morning.
"Just shoot out the front tire
"and then pick off the kiddies
as they come bouncing out. "
Jesus Christ, who's got school buses?
Department of Transportation?
- School board.
- All right.
I'm gonna need elimination prints
from your staff.
Has anyone here
didn't touch this letter?
On my way back to my desk.
They have phones, if you want.
We need to get matches
on blood and fabric.
get the letters up to Sherwood
in Sacramento.
Dave, just one thing.
Is it true they got a print off the cab?
- But that is not for publication.
- Hey, hey, come on.
Did he say they got a print?
Partial.
Whoa.
Does he think that Zodiac's
gonna send another code?
'Cause I think Zodiac's
gonna send another code.
Jesus Harold Christ
on rubber crutches, Bobby.
What are you doing?
You're doing that thing,
the thing we discussed,
the thing that I don't like.
Starts with an "L."
- Oh, looming.
- Yeah.
In cooperation with SFPD,
we will run the Zodiac letter
without including the threat
on school children.
We don't want to start a city-wide panic
so I'm asking all of you
to please keep this confidential.
Just go about your daily business.
Thank you.
I packed you your carrots
and your soda and peanut butter, okay?
- Dad, you don't have to wait with me.
- I know.
You know what? You know what?
I'm gonna drive him today, okay?
Come on.
What's that?
Similarities in the lowercase "r's. "
And that?
It is you waiting in the hall
if you speak again.
I have to concentrate.
Sorry.
"Sorry" counts as speaking.
There are similarities
in the lowercase "r's. "
We have to release the bus threat.
- It'll screw us.
- We're already screwed.
We just went from
"Routine Cabbie Shooting"
to "Mass Murderer Targets Kids. "
The Zodiac Killer
has come to San Francisco.
from the San Francisco
Police Department
which takes credit for the murder
of cab driver Paul Stine,
the Zodiac has threatened to,
"Wipe out a school bus
"and pick off the kiddies
as they come bouncing out. "
If you think you might know
who the Zodiac is,
you can call the San Francisco
Police Department's newest tip line.
Press conference is at 4:00.
We got to give them something.
We're coordinating
with the school board,
and we expect
a break in the case very soon.
- What do we really got?
- We're swamped.
When they can't get anyone
on the tip line
they call the switchboard
and keep getting put through.
You got any hard suspects?
About 90 an hour. I'm up to around 500.
I would love to,
if I could get out of this...
- Homicide, please hold.
- Yeah, hold, please.
We're gonna need to tell them
we got the entire force on this.
How many men can you give me?
Well, right now, it's you and Bill
and Monday's a school day.
Yeah, I know, Chief.
I have three daughters of my own.
He's on the phone with Vallejo.
I'd like to set up a meeting
with your survivor, Michael Mageau.
I can't. He skipped town.
The only guy who's seen Zodiac
without a mask is missing?
When he was still in the hospital
we could show him lineups all day long.
I don't think he wanted
to have anything to do with this.
Can you send us everything
that you have?
Now, we need that print
you lifted from the cab
and we should have been in
on the handwriting.
I apologize.
Things have been moving fast.
Who should I talk to in Napa
so we can coordinate?
Talk to Ken Narlow.
We really should have been in
on the handwriting.
I apologize.
Things have been moving fast.
Listen, we're gonna need
your scene photos.
Can't help you.
Ken, I don't want to get into
a jurisdictional thing here.
No, no, no, no, no.
We didn't have a crime scene.
The ranger that found the kids literally
swept everything into a picnic blanket.
The what?
Boot prints to and from the crime scene
were made by size
military-style boots
sold only at military PXs
designed to walk
on the wings of planes.
And you can't buy at a PX
without a military ID,
so our suspect could be military.
Did you guys narrow your list off of this?
- Yeah.
- Did Vallejo?
I don't know. I don't work in Vallejo.
I work here.
Great. I'm gonna need photos
of those boot prints.
I thought Questioned Documents
already did.
All right.
I'll have Questioned Documents...
Forget it. I'll telefax it to you.
We don't have telefax yet.
- Okay, I'll put it in the mail.
- We'll mail ours, too.
And call Mulanax in Vallejo.
- Maybe he can get you a mimeo.
- Right.
Why don't you just get a photo
off the original plaster cast?
We'd have to wait,
because they don't have a fax.
Look, I'm just trying
to get us coordinated.
Have you called Solano Sheriff's Office?
Why would I call Solano?
Because the two kids that got killed
last Christmas were Solano's.
I thought they were Vallejo.
so you're gonna need
to coordinate with them, too.
Okay.
Bill.
Can I have a word with you?
Where did you see this guy?
We got the call to circle the scene
and look for a Negro male adult.
Where was he?
On Jackson. Heading east.
About the middle of the block.
And this is three minutes
after the shooting?
And this is three minutes
after the shooting?
Give or take. Yeah.
- And you were heading east or west?
- We were going west.
All right, so you're
on Jackson going west.
So the cab was one block
catty-corner southwest?
- Correct.
- Did you slow down?
- Of course we slowed down.
- All right.
Listen, Dispatch said
it was a Negro male.
That was corrected.
No, but at the time
they hadn't changed it.
This guy was white.
Right, not in a hurry.
Kind of lumbering along like...
Lumbering?
What do you mean, "lumbering"?
- Shuffling.
- Stocky? Had a crew cut?
The guy was wearing a dark jacket.
There's no way...
He would have been covered in blood.
Did you stop him?
Did you talk to him?
- Yes? No?
- No.
You need to get with a sketch artist.
We have to put out
a new composite right away.
Five persons have been murdered
in the San Francisco area,
"I shall wipe out a school bus
some morning... "
...to see the Stones in concert
this Sunday.
The new letters
from the Zodiac Killer were sent to
the City room of the
San Francisco Chronicle.
Looming. No looming.
- Have you considered the water theory?
- What?
Geographically, every attack
takes place near a body of water
- or a water-based name.
- This is your water theory?
Lake Berryessa. Blue Rock Springs.
- Lake Herman.
- Wash-ington and Cherry?
You think?
No.
Homicide Investigation
by Lemoyne Snyder...
- "Leymone. "
... and he says you look for patterns,
- so I'm looking for patterns.
- No.
You can't think of this case
in normal police terms.
- Why not?
- You got four crime scenes.
Not a single usable print at the
first three or in any of the letters?
How does our master criminal come
to the city and leave a bloody latent?
he shoots the cabbie
and then takes them off?
Maybe, maybe not.
You're missing the point.
- The point is the first attack...
- David Faraday and Betty Jensen.
They both die.
From there on out,
he only manages to kill the girls.
- Not for lack of trying.
- Not for lack of trying.
Mageau lives, Ferrin dies.
Hartnell lives, Shepard dies.
He gets so caught up with the women
he forgets to finish off the men.
Plus, they're all couples
and all on lover's lanes.
- Paul Stine is not.
- Exactly.
Single, male cab driver
on Washington and Cherry doesn't fit.
Doesn't fit.
He's breaking the pattern.
Yeah?
Someone claiming to be Zodiac
called Oakland PD a half-hour ago.
He says he's gonna call in on Jim
Dunbar's morning show in three hours.
On television?
He wants Melvin Belli on
to counsel him.
All right. All right.
Let's go wake up Melvin.
Animal crackers?
Glove box.
Are these windows bulletproof?
Yes, Melvin.
You don't have to lie down back there.
could snuff me out
at a moment's notice.
Are you sure you're up for this?
Don't you worry about me, Inspector.
I'll be fine when the lights are on.
This man has asked for my help.
The man you're worrying about
snuffing you out?
- Shit.
- KGO must have tipped other stations.
Get him talking.
Convince him to meet you somewhere.
we want you to suggest
Old St. Mary's Church in Chinatown.
You'll be tracing the call?
Pacific Telephone says you need to
keep him on the line for 15 minutes.
Fifteen seconds. Clear the set.
We interrupt our regular program
to bring you this news bulletin.
Welcome to this special edition
of our show
in which we are joined
by attorney Melvin Belli
who the Zodiac Killer
personally requested to appear.
- Good morning, Melvin.
- Good morning, Jim.
So, the phone lines are open.
Mr. Belli is here.
And we ask the public not to call in,
so that the Zodiac himself can reach us.
I saw your Star Trek, by the way.
It was excellent.
A shame about the show.
Good people.
You know, I've often thought of
becoming an actor full-time.
What was your character's name?
- Gorgon.
- Gorgon. That's right.
Roll the tape. Get the tape.
Hello?
Hello? This is Melvin Belli.
Who am I speaking with?
Is there something I can call you
that's a little less ominous?
Sam.
Is there somewhere we can meet, Sam,
and talk about this?
Have a unit go to the Fairmont Hotel.
- Sam.
- Yes?
Do you think you need medical care?
Do you have health problems?
Headaches?
but a chiropractor stopped them
a week ago.
Sam?
He knows they're tracing his calls.
Sam, we'd like you to know
that we are not tracing these calls.
It's a long, difficult process
and ineffective with these short calls.
Sam?
We're not tracing these calls.
You have my word.
Sam, you need to tell me
what your problem is.
I have headaches.
I kill, I don't get them.
That is fucked up!
You want to live, don't you?
Well, this is your passport.
How long have you been
having these headaches?
- Do you have blackouts?
- Yes.
- Do you have fits?
- No. I just have headaches.
Did you attempt to call one other time
when F. Lee Bailey was with us
two or three weeks ago?
And why did you want
to talk to Mr. Bailey?
- I don't want to be hurt.
- Why is he calling?
- Hey, just a second, buddy.
- I don't wanna go to the gas chamber.
And you're not going
to the gas chamber.
I wouldn't think they would ask
for capital punishment.
Do you want me to talk
to the District Attorney?
You sound like you're in
a great deal of pain.
- Oh, okay.
- I'm gonna kill those kids!
Fantastic.
- Let's meet and talk. Just us.
- Okay.
How about Old St. Mary's Church
in Chinatown?
In front of the Daly City
St. Vincent de Paul at 10:30.
I'll see you there.
You fellows certainly know
how to put on a secret meeting.
I don't want to go to the gas chamber.
I have headaches.
It's the voice.
The voice is too high. It's too young.
All right.
Thanks for coming down, Bryan.
That's okay. I got it.
They pulled off the trace.
Our Daly City no-show
called from a mental institution.
Oakland PD's operator is sure
the man she talked to
had a deeper voice.
Calmer.
Might have actually been him.
"So I shall change
my way of collecting slaves.
"I shall no longer announce to anyone
when I commit my murders.
"They shall look like routine robberies,
killings of anger
"The police shall never catch me
"because I have been
too clever for them.
"I look like the description passed out
only when I do my thing.
"The rest of the time
I look entirely different.
"I shall not tell you what
my disguise consists of when I kill.
"As of yet I have left no
fingerprints behind me,
"contrary to what the police say.
"I wear transparent fingertips.
"All it is is two coats of airplane cement
coated on my fingertips.
"I enjoy needling the blue pigs.
Hey, blue pig, I was in the park.
"You were using fire trucks to mask
the sound of your cruising prowl cars.
"to have your nose
rubbed in your booboos?
"If you cops think I am going to take
on a bus the way I stated I was,
"you deserve to have holes
in your heads. "
And you need to look at this.
"Take one bag of
ammonium nitrate fertilizer,
"and dump a few bags
of gravel on top... "
- Okay.
- It's a bomb.
Okay. We gotta call the Army
and see if this
science experiment could actually work.
Another cipher.
- When did these arrive?
- They arrived this morning.
Are you planning to publish?
Robert.
We should have a drink.
Thank you.
- You married?
- Divorced. Two kids.
What do you do for fun?
I love to read.
- I enjoy books.
- Those are the same things.
Why you been going through my trash?
I'll come back to that.
How did you know
he was gonna send another code?
I just guessed.
- Just guessed.
- The first one seemed too easy.
- What is that you're drinking?
- It's an Aqua Velva.
You wouldn't make fun of it
if you tried it.
But who actually cracked the code?
A married couple who like puzzles.
So what's that tell us about the Zodiac?
- He's no expert.
- Right.
It's just a simple substitution code
like the one that
we used to do as boy scouts.
Well, it's not that hard.
You just got to know where to start.
In the first cipher...
You actually carry that around with you?
- Why?
- No reason.
What's the most common double
consonant in the English language?
Consonant?
- The double "L."
- Double "L."
And what's the one word that we know
that he'll use in here, at least once?
- "Kill. "
- Right, "kill. "
So the Hardens start looking
for double symbols,
Each with the same
two symbols preceding them.
So now they've got
a repeating four-letter word
ending with two symbols
that they assume stand for "L."
And since they think the whole word
is "kill" then...
Then you got your "K," you got your "I,"
and you're on your way.
But how do you go
from "A" is one and "B" is two
to figuring out this whole code?
Well, same way I did.
You go to the library.
the author presents a very simple
substitution code in the preface.
Eight of the 26 symbols that
he suggests are found in this cipher.
because there's all
these medieval ones.
But then I found a code
written in the Middle Ages.
Guess what it's called?
The Zodiac Alphabet.
Jesus.
What do you want out of this?
- What?
- What's your angle?
This is good business
for everyone but you.
How do you mean "business"?
Hey. Come to bed.
I'll be up in a minute.
I need to make a phone call.
- Hello?
- Bill?
There's not many basements
in California.
That's right.
I'll have Vallejo and Napa
check with their city planners.
- Get some sleep.
- Yeah, sure.
"Dear Melvin,
this is the Zodiac speaking.
"The one thing I ask of you is this.
Please help me.
"I cannot reach out for help
because this thing in me won't let me. "
Thank you.
"I am finding it extremely difficult
to hold it in check
"and I am afraid I will lose control again
"and take my ninth
and possibly tenth victim. "
Absolutely.
Inspectors, he sent this letter
directly to my residence.
It is a cry for help,
intended as a private communiqué.
Which is why
you contacted the Chronicle.
The people have a right to know.
Toddy?
- When did the letter arrive?
- In the middle of last week.
I was away on safari.
What did you gentlemen
do for Christmas?
- You're looking at it.
- You must see Africa.
Cradle of civilization.
Fascinating people. Beautiful. Savage.
- Back to the killer who wrote to you.
- Yes. Of course.
It is my belief
that he only penned this letter
because he couldn't get through to me
on the Dunbar show or here.
- He tried to contact you here?
- Several times.
I was out,
but he spoke with my housekeeper.
Didn't leave a number.
He's kind of crafty like that.
Do you mind if I speak to her?
Not at all. But the real story is the letter.
- I'll be back.
- Yeah.
She's right this way.
Inspector Toschi, it is my belief
this is a window into this man's soul.
Killing is his compulsion.
Even though he tries to ignore it,
it drives him.
It's in his blood.
Could be.
Or maybe he just likes the attention.
I didn't mean to scare you,
but your right rear wheel is loose.
Really?
If you like,
I could tighten the lugs up for you.
If you don't mind.
- All done.
- Thank you.
No problem. Have a good night.
It's okay.
Are you okay?
Must have been worse than I thought.
I can give you a lift to a service station.
Okay.
It's okay. Come on.
I didn't know you had a baby.
The more the merrier.
You shouldn't smoke. It's a bad habit.
- I think we just passed a filling station.
- It was closed.
Do you always go around
helping people in the night?
When I'm done with them,
they don't need much help.
It's okay.
I'm gonna throw your baby
out the window.
No! Help! Please! No!
She was on the side of the road.
She flagged me down.
- What happened to her?
- She said she jumped from a car.
I found her like this.
- What is it?
- Please, he said...
- It'll be okay.
- Tried to kill me.
My baby!
- Where's her baby?
- She didn't have one when I stopped.
Where's your baby?
Jesus.
- You hid it?
- In case he came back.
"By the way, have you cracked
the last cipher I sent you?
"I'm mildly curious as to how much
money you have on my head now.
"I hope you do not think I was the one
who wiped out that blue meanie
"even though I talked about
killing children with one. "
"I'd like to see some nice Zodiac
buttons wandering around town.
"like peace, black power,
and Melvin eats blubber, et cetera.
"if I saw a lot of people
wearing my button.
- "Please no nasty ones. "
- "This is the Zodiac speaking.
"I shot a man
sitting in a parked car with a. 38.
"The map coupled with this code
will tell you where the bomb is set.
"will not wear
some nice Zodiac buttons.
"So, I now have a little list,
starting with the woman and her baby
"that I gave a rather interesting ride
"for a couple of hours one evening,
a few months back,
"that ended in my burning her car
where I found them. "
We're really not gonna run
any more of his letters?
The new policy. Our brothers in blue
want us to hold back
and see how he reacts.
and this is the first mention
of Kathleen Johns. That's very weird.
That's because he's full of shit.
What do you mean?
You don't know?
Welcome. Please put your stuff down.
You're going down five rows and left.
Looking for the Modesto Bee
from March.
I'm going to stand here
and attempt not to vomit.
- Left.
- Left.
- What am I looking for?
- Kathleen Johns.
Also probably you wanna
pull the Chron from...
Okay, look at this letter again.
The part about Kathleen Johns.
Tell me what facts he gives.
- A woman and her baby abducted.
- Fact.
- The car on fire.
- Okay, now,
Seen it yet?
Everything in the letter
already appeared in the article.
And he's done it before.
Officer Richard Radetich,
shot sitting in his car.
Zodiac claimed that he shot someone
in their car.
Couple days after this article came out.
The police already had somebody
in custody.
Zodiac didn't do it,
but took credit for it anyway
because he's in it for the press.
He even stole his symbol.
- What?
- Yeah. Shit.
If I show you something,
you promise not to tell anyone?
- Who would I tell?
- Okay. Totally solid point. Okay.
That's the only place
that word and that symbol
ever appeared together
before the letters.
The guy stole his logo off a watch.
How can somebody
who's killed 13 people do...
but which ones
can we actually confirm?
There's three in Vallejo,
one in Berryessa, the cabbie. That's it.
Chief's pulling everybody off buses.
Business as usual.
Something'll shake loose.
Not a peep in four months.
First he won't shut up and now...
Maybe we drove him underground.
Maybe he's gone.
311 at 582 Haight, cross at Biltmore.
There's a male...
- Happy birthday, Bill.
- Thanks.
Does it ever bother you
that people call you Shorty?
Does it bother you
that people call you a retard?
- Nobody calls me that.
- Right.
As governor,
I pledge to use all my influence
to make sure that Darlene Ferrin's killer
is brought to justice.
I believe some clues were overlooked
in the murder of Darlene Ferrin.
- I believe her murder was premeditated.
- Who is that?
Florence Douglas, mayor of Vallejo.
She's running for governor.
I believe that the police department
either did not have the money, the time
Sayonara, police endorsement.
Good work, Flo.
You mean like retard?
Yeah.
No.
Tell me that's not a piece
of bloody shirt!
Fuck! Holy fucking crap!
"I feel it in my bones,
you ache to know my name
"and so I'll clue you in.
"But then, why spoil the game?
Happy Halloween. "
Paul, you did call him
a latent homosexual
in at least one of your articles.
Dave. I want a gun.
A gun?
You're in Herb Caen.
"Paul Avery's investigation
has won him the accolade
"of a message from the Zodiac warning,
'You are doomed. '
"As a result, several crime newsmen
are wearing lapel buttons reading,
"'I am not Paul Avery. "'
You should sell these.
You could do well.
It's been a windfall, since
they published the threat on my life.
I got the leads
coming out of the woodwork.
There's one guy down in Riverside.
I'm gonna drive down
and see him tonight.
- You wanna tag along?
- No, I have a date.
- Really?
- Who is this guy?
He wishes to remain anonymous.
I wish to remain infamous.
So we're going to get along great.
Hi. Good evening. Hi.
I'm looking for a Melanie.
Yes.
It's the young lady sitting by herself.
Thank you.
You must be Melanie.
- Which would make you Robert.
- It would.
Glynnis told me lots about you.
- And you have wine, great.
- I do.
Great. How late am I?
Just a few minutes, really.
I just got here myself.
Traffic's bumper to bumper.
I was at the gun range.
- Glynnis said you were a cartoonist.
- Oh, yeah.
Reading.
Get some more...
You need some more napkins.
- For her, actually.
- For her?
My children are terrified of Glynnis.
We're... I'm working on...
Do you know the Zodiac?
- Yeah.
- I'm working with...
- Do you know who Paul Avery is?
- Sounds kind of familiar.
He's the writer
that the Zodiac threatened.
Well, I work near him
and he's going down tonight
to track an anonymous tipster
down in Riverside.
Where is Riverside?
It's near L.A.
Oh, wow. I don't think Paul knows
that it's that far away.
Sounds kind of dangerous.
Yeah. How do you mean?
Well, you said it was
an anonymous tip, right?
Yeah.
So it could be an ambush.
I mean, it could be the Zodiac.
Don't you think it's kind of stupid?
I've never been here before.
Are you ready to order yet?
Yeah, I'll have the penne vodka.
But could you do it in a cream sauce?
Of course.
Maybe give us another minute?
Do you have any change?
Nope. That's a penny.
Do you have to make a phone call?
Yeah, you know,
when you were saying that the Zodiac...
You know, when you said it
was dangerous, I just thought
- that it is dangerous, and it's...
- Stupid?
Stupid. And I just thought that
I should call his wife
and just see if she's heard from him.
I have some change.
Okay. Well, she said
she'd call when she heard from him.
- Good.
- Yeah.
Melanie, I should really go home
and wait for the call.
Is this some sleazy plan
to get me to go home with you?
What? No.
I'll get the food to go.
Hello!
Hi! I'm supposed
to meet somebody here.
Anything?
You don't have to stay.
Are you kidding?
This is the most interesting date
I've ever had.
- Paul?
- Robert?
- Yes.
- You sitting down?
- Yes.
- You sitting down?
You're not gonna believe this.
Dave!
In a bizarre twist,
the hunted has become hunter.
San Francisco Chronicle reporter
and Zodiac target Paul Avery
claims to have uncovered
new information
regarding the only unsolved homicide
in Riverside County's history,
that Avery now believes
was the Zodiac's first victim.
What?
- He didn't call you about this?
- Hang on!
The Riverside killer
wrote to the press letters
that I then took personally to
the Office of Questioned Documents.
How'd he get the evidence
out of Riverside?
He took it to Sherwood
without telling us, the son of a bitch.
You know how bad this looks?
Hey, how do we know
that this lead is real?
It's very real. You know how I know?
Because I saw it on TV.
Excuse me.
Dave.
Hi.
Dave, you know Mel Nicolai.
He's working the case for Justice.
All due respect,
can someone explain to me
why I'm reading
about breaks in this case
in the Chronicle instead
of getting calls from you?
We got screwed.
You do get your name in the paper a lot.
People talk.
I don't ever talk about an open
investigation, period. Okay, Ken?
Dave? Hey. Hi.
Paul Avery. Can I catch a ride
with you gents when we get there?
He's gonna make me take a cab
when we're going to the same place.
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for choosing PSA.
- Fair enough. Fair enough.
- Please take your seats at this time.
Remember, smoking is
in the last six aisles only.
- Cross? Hi.
- Yeah.
- Detective David Toschi, SFPD.
- How are you doing?
Great. Thanks for having us
down today.
Not at all.
I hear you have some files for us.
I'll show you mine. You show me yours.
- Frisco huh?
- That's right. San Francisco.
- Ken Narlow from Napa.
- Ken.
- Mel Nicolai, Justice.
- Mel.
Here's what we know.
Cheri Jo Bates attended
Riverside Community College.
She studies in the library
the night of October 30th, 1966.
She leaves with an unidentified male
at closing, 9:00 p. m.
Her body's found the next morning
in a parking lot, stabbed to death.
Her car is disabled.
Someone cut the coil in the distributor,
the battery died.
The someone comes back,
offers to help.
- Like Kathleen Johns.
- Who?
A woman outside of Modesto,
might be a Zodiac victim.
Might. Might be.
I have her comp right here in this file.
Okay.
A typewritten confession was sent
to the Riverside Press Enterprise
on November 29th,
a month after Bates's murder.
They ran it.
"I'm not sick. I am insane.
But that will not stop the game.
"This letter should be published
for all to read. "
He wants to be published.
He calls it a game.
Six months later, the police,
the girl's father, and the paper,
they all received these.
These are what Sherwood Morrill
matched to the Zodiac letters?
These and the desktop. Don.
This was found a couple of months later
by a janitor in RCC storage.
Sherwood got
a handwriting match off wood?
Who etches in their own handwriting?
our letters and your letters,
I don't see it.
How did Paul Avery
get his hands on the exemplars?
I gave them to him.
We talked on the phone the other day
for about an hour.
And I told him you were gonna be here.
- You told him we were meeting?
- Yeah.
I also told him
we don't think this is Zodiac.
- You don't think this is Zodiac?
- We got a guy we like for it.
We don't have enough
to pin it on him yet,
but we're pretty sure it's him.
If you don't think this is Zodiac,
then why give anything to Avery?
I'm trying to cooperate.
Oh, that's how you cooperate?
By giving information to reporters?
Look, I don't know
about the handwriting,
So, let's just say
that your guy did Cheri Jo.
He types the confession.
Zodiac reads it in the paper, and he
writes a letter taking credit for it.
But, in my opinion,
you guys came south for nothing.
I don't care what he says.
This still could be Z.
The problem is
the entire state already thinks it is.
Well, there's your press agent.
Talk to him about it.
I come in peace.
I don't want any trouble.
I really don't want to talk to you
right now, Paul. Not now.
- Just trying to do my job.
- Oh, really? Well, now I can't do mine.
We're already screwed with
the amount of tips we got on this thing,
and you just freaked out the entire state.
I have got Napa, Vallejo, and DOJ
looking at me sideways
and Riverside's telling me
I'm on a snipe hunt!
Jesus. Hey, Cheri Jo Bates was a gift.
I gave that to you.
You and Armstrong
never would have found her.
This may not be Zodiac.
Does that matter to you?
- What if it is?
- Does it matter that Riverside may not
be able to make a case
against their suspect because of you?
Tell it to Sherwood.
I'm out here, beating the bushes,
trying to draw him out.
We're in this together.
because I'm not interested
in upping my circulation.
Oh, boy. He wrote me.
He threatened my life.
Been a year-and-a-half,
you gonna catch this fucking guy or not?
- Go fuck yourself.
- Happily.
Thank you.
- Did you see this?
- Unfortunately, yes.
Here comes every lunatic in California.
I'm the Zodiac.
And how did you kill your victims?
All I'm authorized to tell you
is that he's still under
government employment.
- And who authorized you to tell me this?
- That's all I'm authorized to say.
could have done something
like cut off all the victims' hands.
Zodiac didn't cut off
any of the victims' hands.
- Are you sure?
- Yes, sir.
Travis and I worked here
side by side for 10 years.
His foot gets crushed in an accident
and the killings begin.
- Coincidence?
- I don't know.
Have you considered
the killer might be Paul Avery?
Frequently.
He was drinking Coors,
getting a load on.
Starts talking about hunting people.
Like that book.
Says how you can put a light
at the end of a gun
to use as a sight in the dark.
- He said that?
- Yeah.
So I asked him,
"How would you get away with it?"
"'cause there'd be no real motive
to the thing. "
Then he said he'd write letters
to the police
and call himself Zodiac
to mess with them.
Leigh liked messing with people.
- You're positive he said "Zodiac"?
- Yeah.
I thought it was a stupid name.
So I told him.
He got up all upset and said,
"I don't care what you think.
"I've thought about it a long time
and that's the name I'm gonna use. "
Did you feel like he'd been
thinking about it a long time?
He was raw about losing his job
at the school.
He talked about shooting out
the tires of a school bus
and picking off the little darlings.
- He actually used those words?
- That's what made me remember.
Afterwards, I told my wife
I didn't wanna see him again.
And I haven't since.
I know he's been up to that lake
a bunch of times.
Lake Berryessa?
Did you ever go with him?
Couple times. We went fishing
by Putah Creek near there.
Tell him when you put it together.
About a year ago, in the paper,
there was a story about the Zodiac.
And it all comes back.
I tried to call the local cops.
They blew him off.
Thought he was a nut.
And you're sure
the conversation you had about Zodiac
It couldn't have been any later.
I started a new job in L.A.
On January 20th.
I had to move.
- This is my problem. This guy...
- Arthur Leigh Allen?
This guy, Leigh,
just lays out his entire evil plan
to a fishing buddy on New Year's Day?
I don't know.
He's angry, he's been drinking,
been thinking about it for a while.
I can buy that.
So why didn't Cheney
contact us sooner?
I checked. He did.
First recorded contact
with the police department about Allen
He just got lost in the shuffle.
Did Cheney have anything
against Allen?
Did Allen screw his wife or anything?
We're gonna do
a full background check.
So, let's pull
some handwriting samples.
Hi. I talked to Sherwood.
He got the samples.
- What are you having?
- BLT.
So, the check stubs are a wash.
There's not enough handwriting.
The application's got more,
but it doesn't look like Z's,
so he can't rule him in.
But he can't rule him out, either.
- Well, that's vague.
- He needs more samples.
When Mel got the application
from Valley Springs,
they told him that
Allen had been fired for touching kids.
- Touching?
- Polite euphemism.
- So what do you want to do?
- Make some phone calls.
- Are you done with the fries?
- Go ahead.
to look at the copies
of the Zodiac letters we sent you?
Yeah.
Some of this stuff is pretty creepy.
- Yeah, we know that.
- I mean, creepy like Leigh.
He misspells words like that.
He thinks it's funny.
What about the handwriting?
I don't know.
Don't you have experts for that stuff?
Our man at Questioned Documents
says it's inconclusive.
Maybe he did it with his other hand.
for someone to have written
with the wrong hand.
- What do you mean?
- He's ambidextrous.
He can write with either hand.
Didn't you guys know that?
Job applications,
letters to friends, et cetera.
But he writes the Zodiac letters
with his right hand
producing a different handwriting
that he can't be linked to.
- Where is he?
- Vallejo.
He works at Union Oil in Pinole.
His brother's up there, too.
See them both.
Make sure you call Mulanax.
It is his backyard.
Oh, right, because that
worked so well for us in Riverside.
You can talk to him in here.
Coke machine's busted, by the way.
I'll go get him for you.
So how do you guys wanna do this?
Well, Bill talked to the informants.
He leads, we follow?
It's okay by me.
This is Inspector Dave Toschi
and Sergeant Jack Mulanax.
We're investigating the Zodiac murders
in San Francisco and Vallejo.
The informant notified us
that you made certain statements
to the first Zodiac murder.
If they're true,
they're quite incriminating.
Do you recall
having any such conversation?
- No.
- Have you ever read
or heard anything about the Zodiac?
When it was first in the paper.
But I didn't follow it
after those first reports.
- Why not?
- Too morbid. I...
I told all this to the other officer.
- Which other officer?
- From Vallejo.
Do you remember his name?
No, but it was right after
the murder at the lake.
And what did you tell this officer?
I told him that I'd gone to Salt Point
that weekend to skin dive.
That I was alone
but I met a couple there.
I have their names at home
if you want them.
- Leigh.
- What?
Leigh. Nobody calls me Arthur.
Also, that day when I came home,
my neighbor saw me.
It was around 4:00. But I forgot
to tell the other officer that.
- Neighbor's name?
- Bill White.
He died a week or so afterwards.
Heart attack.
So I didn't think to call to follow up.
The knives I had in my car
with the blood on them,
that blood came from a chicken
that I killed for dinner.
- What?
- I had knives in my car that weekend.
Maybe Bill saw them
and called the other officer on me.
Were you ever in Southern California
at any time in 1966?
- Is this about the Riverside killing?
- Yes.
Well, I guess I was there
around that time.
I used to go down there a lot.
I like the auto races.
Informant says that
you're ambidextrous?
You can't write with both hands?
My teachers tried to make me
when I was a kid, but I couldn't.
I'm left-handed.
He also said that you made statements
about killing school children.
That is...
That is horrible. That is...
That's a horrible thing to say.
So, you weren't angry
about being fired from Valley Springs
for touching your students?
I'm not the Zodiac.
That's a nice watch.
Thank you.
May I see it?
May I see it?
Where'd you get it?
It was a Christmas gift
from my mother two years ago.
That's very sweet.
You don't remember anyone
you might have had a conversation with
regarding the Zodiac?
Maybe Ted Kidder or Phil Tucker
at Vallejo Recreation.
But I couldn't be positive.
I used to work there when...
What?
The Most Dangerous Game.
That's why you're here, isn't it?
It was my favorite book in high school.
It's about this man who waits for people
to get shipwrecked on this island.
Because he was
tired of hunting animals,
he hunted the people for the challenge.
And man is the most
dangerous animal of all?
That's the whole point of the story.
Great book.
May I go?
Sure.
- Thanks for your time.
- I'm willing to help in any way possible.
I look forward to the day
when police officers
are no longer referred to as pigs.
Thanks.
We'll be in touch.
So does anyone think this suspect
warrants further investigation?
These are copies of some
of the Zodiac letters that were sent.
We'd like you to take a look at them.
You think my brother's the Zodiac.
Are you going to arrest him?
Mrs. Allen, we don't arrest people
just because we're interested in them.
Is it true about the children?
Unfortunately.
We don't see him much anymore
since we found out.
What are your feelings
about Don Cheney?
Don Cheney? My old roommate?
- Was he the one who contacted you?
- That's confidential.
If he were to tell you something,
I'd believe it to be true.
- This one.
- What about it?
Here, where he spells
"Christmas" with two "S's. "
We got a Christmas card from Leigh
a couple years ago.
He spelled it the exact same way.
Christ-mass.
- Would you still have that?
- I can look for it.
Thank you. That'd be great.
Is there anything else
we can do to help?
The brother said
he would search Leigh's apartment
next time he went out of town.
- That gets you around a warrant.
- For the time being.
If we do find something,
Mulanax will go to the DA in Vallejo,
and we could search the place properly.
Now I got a chance to talk to the cop
who interviewed Leigh Allen
two days after the Berryessa murders.
but didn't think he looked like a killer
so he didn't like him for Z.
- But you do?
- I wish I could've taken the guy in there.
Take it slow, Dave.
Try and find more stuff for Sherwood.
A match'll get us farther
on the warrants.
- Avery's on two.
- Tell him to screw.
You want me to communicate that
verbatim or can I spice it up a little?
Yeah.
- Paul, I've been thinking...
- Oh, God save us all.
The letter to Melvin Belli
was sent exactly one year
after the Lake Herman Road murder.
And the one to Cheri Jo Bates' father
was sent exactly six months
after her death.
- She was killed a day before Halloween.
- Yeah.
And you received a Halloween card...
You know, these are all fascinating
pieces of news, Robert,
it's a bit early in the day.
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you up.
- No, no, no.
- I just thought that...
- No, no, no.
This suspect is not your Zodiac.
This sample matches the canceled
checks and the application?
Perfectly.
So we've just retested the left hand.
I mean, we know he's ambidextrous.
In 38 years, I've never seen anyone
that ambidextrous.
Both hands would have commonalities.
I'm sorry.
Just not gonna work.
- Homicide, Toschi.
- Dave, it's Jack Mulanax.
Hey. Mulanax. Yeah.
He won't sign off on a warrant
for Allen's house.
- Why not?
- Said it wasn't enough.
Now, unless we bring him a handwriting
match or some evidence that...
How are we gonna get evidence
if we can't toss the house?
- I truly am sorry.
- No, no. Thank you, Jack.
What do you wanna do?
Don't know what I can do
without Vallejo.
We need Allen's right hand.
We can't get it without a warrant.
Are there other guys
you should be looking at?
Twenty-three hundred?
asking to be put in charge
of the Zodiac investigation?
I merely suggested...
On our letterhead?
...that those with intimate knowledge
of the case
create an information clearinghouse
to promote an exchange
and free flow of ideas.
- And that you run it.
- Well, who better than me?
The marked man.
Paul, if you want to work here,
I need three things.
Two, stop doing
whatever else it is you're doing.
you feel my excellent work is no longer
in step with this trashy provincial rag,
I'll more than happily...
More than happily
decamp for greener pastures.
- Paul?
- Yep.
- What was that?
- An editorial tête-à-tête.
- Wanna grab a drink?
- It's 10:00 in the morning.
Late breakfast?
- Early lunch, or...
- Paul.
Are you okay?
No.
Thank you for asking.
Shorty! Let's go out for one.
We couldn't get a warrant.
Last year we arranged for Leigh
to get help from a social worker.
He only went twice.
We saw him recently for
the first time in nine months.
My mother-in-law brought him by
to see the new baby.
After he left,
I went to see that social worker.
He couldn't talk about a former patient,
so I just asked him straight out
if he thought Leigh
was capable of killing people.
- Because of patient confidentiality...
- The man said yes.
Why hadn't you seen him
in nine months?
He's going to school in Santa Rosa.
- Santa Rosa? Where is he living?
- In his trailer.
- In Santa Rosa?
- Sonoma County.
We wouldn't have to go
through the Vallejo DA.
It's been 11 months
since you talked to this guy,
and now you wanna search his trailer?
If not, we get his prints and
handwriting samples from both hands.
I thought Sherwood shut you down.
What if I can get a second opinion?
I don't wanna step on Sherwood's toes.
He trained me at this.
Terry, all I need to know
is if the suspect is ambidextrous.
Could he possibly have written
those letters with his other hand?
Between you and me?
Because there are differing
schools of thought on this.
Get the samples of his other hand.
If he's the Zodiac, you'll get a match.
That's the current thinking,
according to Terry Pascoe.
Meanwhile, I spoke to a psychologist
who'd be willing to testify
that someone who undergoes
a personality change like Zodiac
would manifest it physically,
altering his handwriting.
Which is why Sherwood couldn't
get a match from Allen's samples.
We got Terry Pascoe,
this psychology guy,
coupled with Cheney...
It could be enough for a warrant.
Get Cheney on the record.
"And that he would call himself Zodiac. "
Yes.
And you're willing to swear
to this, under oath, in Superior Court?
Without any hesitation.
Thank you very much, Mr. Cheney.
Thank you very much for your time.
Thank you.
Suspect is Arthur Leigh Allen.
Lives in Sunset Trailer Court
in Santa Rosa, California.
Physical description.
Allen is similar in height,
weight and build
to a man seen at Lake Berryessa
on the day of the stabbings.
I understand he doesn't look
much like the San Francisco composite.
but lumbering Caucasian
with a crew cut is right on.
We never had much confidence
in the composite from the kids.
The patrolman
who saw Zodiac that night
said he didn't look much like the sketch.
Military boot prints.
Allen was in the Navy.
Wears a size 10-and-a-half.
Same size as the prints
found at Berryessa.
Cheney says Allen owns several
firearms. We'll list them in the warrant.
- And the ciphers.
- Could be code training in the Navy,
and people have seen Allen
with ciphers in the past.
That would be his sister-in-law
and a man named Phil Tucker
that he worked with
at a public pool in Vallejo.
And Phil Tucker told us about
a conversation that he had with Allen
about how to attach a flashlight
to the barrel of a gun.
That gives us two sources
on the ciphers and two on the flashlight.
Suspect worked for elementary schools
and was fired for molestation
in March, April '68.
- Could give him motive.
- At the very least, it's home turf.
which the two major threats
centered around.
Allen works as a chemist.
Take him through the geography.
Vallejo murders.
Allen lives in Vallejo
with his mother in her basement.
Berryessa murder. On the day
that the two kids were stabbed
his neighbor saw bloody knives
in his truck
which he claimed were used
to kill a chicken.
He claimed he did, but he's been unable
to produce the names
of the couple he supposedly met
on the day of Berryessa.
The bottom line is that Allen
can't alibi up on anything.
- You want to tell me about the name?
- What name?
Zodiac.
Allen wears a watch that bears
both the word and crosshair symbol.
And he mentioned Zodiac to Cheney
a year and a half
before it appeared in any letter.
- John...
- That's pretty good, guys.
- We think so, too.
- Let's take it to a judge.
Mr. Allen?
This is the
Santa Rosa Police Department.
We have a warrant
to search your residence.
Hello?
I'll check with the neighbors.
Close the door.
Close the door,
there's rodents running around.
Neighbor said he tore out of here
about a half-hour ago.
- You think somebody tipped him?
- We're not leaving till he comes back.
I'll check the back.
Jesus.
- What?
- Squirrels.
- Like the Stine scene?
- We'll have those checked for blood.
And a pair of black gloves.
Men's seven,
just like the ones we found in the cab.
Well, he's got the same size shoes
and gloves as Z.
Probably just a coincidence.
Dave, I got a gun.
Check that. Two guns.
They're both. 22s.
One automatic, one revolver.
Because he happens to have
an M-1 rifle here in the closet.
For little darlings bouncing off buses.
Someone's here.
No.
On the handwriting?
Ballistics, no match.
Prints, no match. Writing, no match.
Because we got handwriting
from both his hands.
And neither hand matches.
Forget Sherwood.
Let's get another opinion.
Damn it.
Hey.
What do you want? Time off?
A hug?
Do you know what
the worst part of this is?
I can't tell if I wanted it
to be Allen so bad
because I actually thought it was him,
or I just want all this to be over.
It's because you thought it was him.
You know what? Take some time off.
Spend some time with your wife
and the kids.
Go to Candlestick. See a movie.
"To the city of San Francisco,
I will enjoy killing one person every day
"in the personal column
San Francisco Chronicle,
"it will be my next pleasure
to kill a Catholic priest or a...
I've got to get out of here.
Where the hell does he expect me
to find $100,000?
You're not thinking of paying him,
are you, Mr. Mayor?
The city of San Francisco does not
pay criminals not to commit a crime.
The killer gets shot in the chest.
That's how it ends.
Do I know you?
I'm Robert Graysmith.
I work at the Chronicle with Paul Avery.
Dave Toschi. Nice to meet you.
Dave! That Harry Callahan
did a hell of a job with your case.
- What do you do at the Chronicle?
- I'm a cartoonist.
That's nice.
You're gonna catch him.
Pal, they're already
making movies about it.
We today have concluded
an agreement
to end the war and bring peace
with honor in Vietnam.
...Charles Manson for
the Tate-La Bianca mass murders...
Guilty in the Chowchilla
kidnapping case.
...an absolute pardon
unto Richard Nixon...
- No, I'm not a crook...
- ... Generation of hostility...
...has now led to the death
of 50,000 Americans
and several
hundred thousand Vietnamese...
Patricia Hearst is kidnapped

All of us should stand up together
and say, "No more. "
Your Declaration of Independence
spreads that...
Americans admire
the United Kingdom...
whom they believe
to be the "Son of Sam... "
Hi. We haven't met.
I'm Robert Graysmith.
I'm Duffy Jennings.
- Nice to meet you.
- Good to meet you, man.
You got a great desk.
Guy who used to work here
was a great reporter.
I mean, it's a honor
to leave the Chronicle
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.
I'm just right down there
at the Art department
- if you need anything, Duffy.
- Yeah.
- You sure you don't want the car, Bill?
- It's your turn.
- You sure you don't want the car, Bill?
- It's your turn.
You could just drop me off at my place
and take the car.
You should keep the car.
Yeah?
I'm not coming in tomorrow.
Why? What's up?
I'm done.
I put in for a transfer.
Where?
Looking at Fraud.
I can't be on call anymore.
I wanna see these kids grow up.
- You'll be okay.
- Yeah. I'll be fine.
I'm not leaving you
holding the bag on anything, am I?
No.
Okay.
Maybe you'll have a chance
to try your Japanese food, the raw stuff.
Yeah.
I'm not Paul Avery.
The boys need to be tucked in, please,
and the baby needs changing.
- I'll flip you for it.
- You wish.
Nobody has more Zodiac crap
than you do.
- Are you kidding me?
- Hi, Paul.
Permission to come aboard.
It's right there.
Anyway, you got shoes on.
This is perfect right here.
- That's the one.
- Okay.
- See that? Mesmerizing.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
My own kids
would kill me for one of those.
- How are you?
- Fantastic.
the Bee ain't exactly
the Chron, but fuck it, right?
Do you want a drink?
I don't have anything blue, but I got...
Don't worry about that.
Don't worry about it.
It's no bother at all.
Nobody comes by from the old days.
Cheers.
To your health and mine.
Mostly mine.
what's new?
- I've been thinking.
- Yeah.
Somebody should write a book.
Somebody should write a fucking book,
that's for sure.
- About what?
- About Zodiac.
It's not new.
I've been thinking that
if you put all the information together,
maybe you could jog something loose.
And then I was thinking that
nobody knows the case better than you.
Yeah. That's true.
You know all the players,
and you have all the files.
Lost them.
You lost them?
Or I tossed them. I don't know.
I moved onto a boat.
You know that we work
in the daily business, right?
What do you think
we were doing back then?
Do you know that more people die
in the East Bay commute
every three months
than that idiot ever killed?
he wrote a few letters,
and he faded into a footnote.
Not that I haven't been sitting here idly
waiting for you to drop by
and reinvigorate my sense of purpose.
It was four years ago. Let it fucking go.
You're wrong. It was important.
If it was so fucking important,
what did you ever do?
You hovered over my desk,
you stole from wastebaskets.
Am I being unkind?
Oh, that's right, I forgot.
You went to the library.
I'm sorry I bothered you.
- Hey, hi.
- Hi.
- Where you been?
- The library.
Thank you!
- Inspector Toschi?
- Yeah? One moment, please.
- Hi.
- Hi.
We met at the movies once.
It must have been magical.
I'm Robert Graysmith.
I work at the Chronicle.
I was wondering if I could buy you lunch.
I was wondering if I could buy you lunch.
He's actually the reason I'm here.
I wanted to ask you about Zodiac.
Well, I appreciate the interest,
but we don't discuss open cases.
Oh, well, what's going on with it,
day to day?
We're actively pursuing all leads.
Zodiac hasn't written in three years.
You know how many murders
we've had in San Francisco since then?
- No.
- Over 200.
That's a lot of dead people
and grieving families that need our help.
Excuse me? I care.
Okay. Can I show you something?
I've been doing research
on the first cipher.
Everything an amateur
would need to create it
can be found in these books.
Now, I started thinking
that if you can track these books,
then maybe you can track the man.
So, I remember you thought
that Zodiac was military,
so I went to every base library
and I got a list of every person
who's ever checked out these books
and that's when I found this.
- Missing.
- It means they were stolen.
So, almost every book on ciphers
was stolen from the Presidio Library?
And the Oakland Army Terminal Library.
Somebody didn't want a record
of ever having checked out these books.
Who are you again?
I just wanna help.
I can't allow you to help.
I can't discuss the case with you.
I can't give you information,
and I certainly couldn't tell you
to go see Ken Narlow in Napa.
N- A-R-L-O-W.
I'm sorry, Mr. Graysmith,
but we don't cooperate with writers.
- And Dave Toschi sent you?
- Yes.
- Why?
- Maybe he...
Maybe he thought
that I could do some good.
- What are you, some kind of boy scout?
- Eagle Scout, actually, first class.
Well, if you wanna do this,
don't let me stop you.
I understand what you're trying to do.
But this is an open police investigation.
I'm a friend of Dave Toschi's.
And he said
that you might be able to help.
I mean, the case is dead.
Zodiac's long gone.
That's what they say.
Anything that you see that's relevant,
you got to remember in your head.
Okay.
- Which one?
- All of them.
And there's more in the next room.
They're all marked with these numbers.
Once. In high school.
What's this?
Thank you.
"Most Dangerous Game.
"Do not eliminate this suspect
because of handwriting.
"It was all just deep breathing. George.
"It was a strange man. George.
Strange man. "
Thank you so much.
- Hey, Jack.
- Hey, Bawart.
- Who's that?
- That's Graysmith.
Some cartoonist.
Thinks he's gonna solve the Zodiac.
- Thank you for meeting me, Inspector.
- No. We're not meeting, Robert.
We're just two guys
who happen to be sitting
on the same bench at the same time.
I've got five minutes.
I've got to get back to the Hall.
Okay. As far as you know,
did anyone ever get in touch
with Mike Mageau
during your investigation
- and show him suspect photos?
- Why?
Well, he's the only surviving victim
who ever saw Zodiac without a mask.
Mageau and Darlene,
that's Vallejo's case.
Paul Stine is mine.
You've got four minutes now.
Darlene Ferrin was being followed.
Now, I know Mulanax says
that they already found this guy,
a George Waters?
But he also said
that she had a lot of admirers
who would come to
the restaurant where she worked.
- She was popular.
- Very.
Yeah. So...
She and her husband,
they move into their new house,
and one night they throw
this painting party.
And what's a painting party?
It's a party where people come
and help you paint.
Sounds like a terrible party.
Well, supposedly,
somebody who's not Waters shows up.
And Darlene is terrified of him.
So you think that Darlene knew Zodiac?
And if Zodiac knew Darlene,
then maybe Mageau knows Zodiac.
Maybe. But Mageau's gone.
So if you wanna connect
Darlene to Zodiac,
you're gonna have to find another way.
I have another way.
Phone calls the night
of Darlene's murder.
- Yeah, Zodiac called the police.
- No, Dave, there were four other calls.
There were two to Darlene's house,
one to Darlene's brother-in-law,
and one to Darlene's father-in-law.
Just heavy breathing.
and this was before anyone in the family
knew that Darlene had been shot.
- This was in the Vallejo files?
- Yeah.
God damn it.
It's got to be more
than just a coincidence, right?
I mean, somebody doesn't just randomly
prank phone call a victim's entire family
So, either Zodiac shoots
a random couple,
then he recognizes Darlene...
Or Darlene was shot on purpose.
Either way,
Zodiac had to have known Darlene.
So, I can't find Mageau,
so maybe I can find Darlene's sister.
And maybe she can tell me
who this mystery man is.
Try that. I've got to go. She's very cute.
it's interesting that you should mention
Zodiac calling people at home.
He did that in San Francisco once.
What? Who did he call?
I can't tell you.
That's privileged information.
But maybe Melvin Belli could.
Melvin Belli.
How do I get to Melvin Belli?
- He should be along soon.
- Oh, that's all right.
I've really...
I've only been waiting two hours, so...
He's usually not this late.
Oh, cookies. Thank you.
These look great.
- You are here on business?
- I'm writing a book about the Zodiac.
I remember that. I spoke to him.
- You mean to Mr. Belli about the case?
- No, to the Zodiac when he called.
He said he had to kill
because it was his birthday.
He said it... Wait.
He said it was his birthday?
Yes. You want something to drink?
- When was this?
- Oh, so many years ago.
Mr. Belli was away for Christmas.
Gone for a week.
The Zodiac called,
wanting to talk to him.
He said, "I have to kill.
Today is my birthday. "
And then he hangs up.
Then the letter arrived.
So, the call came
before the letter of December 20th.
Mr. Belli was gone for a week?
He came back on Christmas.
Not a good day to work.
Is that helpful?
She said it was his birthday.
Well, you'd have to confirm that,
now wouldn't you?
How?
Well, I never spoke to her,
but maybe my partner did.
- How do I get a hold of him?
- You don't. Bill wanted out of this.
As far as I'm concerned,
he should stay out.
How do I confirm it?
Well, if my partner
did talk to someone from Justice,
then they would've had
to put that in a report.
- Okay.
- Mel Nicolai.
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.
I just need to confirm a date.
- Mr. Graysmith...
- I've narrowed it down
between the 18th and the 20th
of December, and I just need...
Okay, I'll play.
Let's say this phone call did take place.
Let's say it really was Zodiac.
Why would he volunteer
the day he was born?
just like nobody died over the weekend
when he was gonna kill a dozen people,
or when he was gonna
shoot school kids or blow up buses.
What if he made a mistake?
What if he wasn't lying?
What if it was him on the phone?
He didn't expect to pick it up,
a nice person to pick up.
What if? What if? What if?
Look, off the record,
Bill Armstrong checked this out.
We took this very seriously.
None of the suspects had the
same birthday as this phantom caller.
Bill Armstrong.
Can I give you a piece of advice?
You're looking in the wrong place.
Handwriting, fingerprints,
that's what this whole thing's about.
Stick to the evidence.
Hi.
- Hey. How was your day?
- Long.
Who's Sherwood Morrill?
He's a handwriting expert
in Sacramento.
He called.
He said he can meet you
tomorrow morning at 7:00.
- So you're taking off work?
- Just an hour.
Sacramento's two hours away.
- Really?
- Yes.
What's this?
"Robert Graysmith has quietly been
shopping his book about the Zodiac. "
Yeah.
It talks all about you
researching Zodiac.
I'm not so sure that's something
we want people to know about.
Why? Are you embarrassed?
Robert, what's the one thing
we know about Zodiac?
Yeah, but he's never
gonna read Herb Caen.
- Hello.
- Mr. Graysmith?
The Robert Graysmith
mentioned in the paper today?
- Yeah?
- I can tell you who the Zodiac is.
Who is this?
The Zodiac Killer
is obsessed with movies.
I tried to tell the police,
but they wouldn't follow through on it.
There's a man you need to find.
His name is Bob Vaughn.
- Pen, pen.
- V- A-U-G-H-N.
Mr. Vaughn does not know
his friend is a killer,
and he is storing
some film canisters for him.
Your toast is burning.
We choose at some point in our lives
how to physically construct each letter.
We choose at some point in our lives
how to physically construct each letter.
our handwriting may change
over the years,
but the moves themselves
remain unaltered.
- Understand?
- Yes.
Except Zodiac's doesn't.
Specifically with his "K."
In his first letters,
he executed the "K" with two strokes.
- Why?
- We don't know.
How many suspects
were cleared through handwriting?
All of them.
Also the print in the cab.
No match was ever found.
Is there any way that someone
could beat a handwriting test?
No.
Whoever the Zodiac is,
he's not someone I cleared.
About a month ago, a man showed up
on my doorstep very distraught.
His name was Wallace Penny.
He said he knew who the Zodiac was.
Gave me a name.
Rick. Rick somebody.
- Rick Marshall?
- Yeah.
I think that the man
who you talked to called me, too.
I never cleared a Rick Marshall.
Hello?
Hello? Who is this?
It's a wrong number.
Does the name Rick Marshall
mean anything to you?
What are you after?
What do you got?
Hypothetically, you just named
my favorite suspect in the whole case.
This is off the record.
Couple years back,
I was trying to get Marshall's prints.
I handed him a photo.
He looks at it. He's about to give it back
and he stops and he says,
"My goodness,
I got fingerprints all over this. "
And he wipes them off.
Why didn't you test him for handwriting?
Because when they finally
did run his prints,
they cleared him
against the one in Stine's cab.
- So, then, it's not him.
- Maybe yes, maybe no.
No. What do you mean?
Zodiac left gloves behind at the scene.
If he had the foresight
to bring gloves with him,
how the hell's he gonna
accidentally leave a print behind?
But it was in the victim's blood.
or a cop just reaches out,
boom, false print.
Yeah, but that print
disqualified 2,500 suspects.
Which is why we also used handwriting.
But not for Rick Marshall.
SFPD saw a handwritten sign
in the window of his house.
Decided it looked nothing
like the Z letters, so they just moved on.
How do they know
that Rick Marshall wrote the sign?
My thoughts exactly.
Rick Marshall was a Navy man.
He received code training.
He was also a projectionist
at a silent film theater.
Well, then, how do I get copies
of Rick Marshall's handwriting?
Three ways.
One, get a warrant, which you can't.
Two, get him to volunteer,
which he won't.
Get creative.
I don't know what to tell you.
You get it, I'll analyze it.
Okay, what about
the guy who came to see you,
the one who called me?
Yeah. Did he leave a number?
- Hello?
- Hi, this is Robert Graysmith.
I need a sample
of Rick Marshall's handwriting.
Mr. Penny,
if Rick Marshall is the Zodiac,
I need a sample of his handwriting
to confirm it.
Can you help me or not?
Rick used to draw movie posters
for the theater Vaughn worked at.
- I'll send one down.
- Thank you.
- I'll need to see more samples.
- Yeah, but is it...
It's as close as I've ever seen.
We have to tread lightly here.
We're talking about
implicating this man as the Zodiac.
I can get more. I'll just find Vaughn
and I'll track down Linda.
I've been to the DMV,
and I talked to her parents,
but still, nobody knows
where to find her.
Mr. Graysmith, most of the writing
matches the exemplar.
In a way, though, it's the part that
doesn't match that scares me the most.
- What do you mean?
- Well, on the poster,
the one letter that absolutely,
positively does not match
is the letter "K."
You wouldn't happen to have any
animal crackers in there, would you?
Unit Five.
Toschi needs to call in on a landline.
- Dispatch.
- Hey. Dave Toschi.
- Dave?
- Yeah. What's up?
It came in this morning
and you need to see it right now.
See what?
The new Zodiac letter.
And it mentions you.
Hall of Justice!
Now! Come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on!
Dave!
Do you have it with you?
"This is the Zodiac speaking.
I'm back with you.
"Tell Herb Caen I am here,
I have always been here.
"That city pig Toschi is good,
but I am smarter and better.
"I'm waiting for a good movie about me.
Who will play me?
"I'm now in control of all things. "
These guys are from Internal Affairs.
We need to talk.
the San Francisco Police Department
has confirmed
that the man
who calls himself the Zodiac
and terrorized the Bay Area
has broken his silence of 51 months.
In a letter claiming,
"I am back with you,"
the Zodiac makes no overt threats
against the citizenry,
and muses that his life and times
would make the best movie script yet.
These carrots are perfect.
The terse 66 word message
also manages...
Just go.
...to mention San Francisco Chronicle
columnist Herb Caen
and the Department's own
David Toschi by name.
- May I be excused?
- Are they targets?
and finish at least half
of what's on that plate.
More team coverage
on the cipher slayer's return...
- Okay?
- Okay.
San Francisco Chronicle columnist
Armistead Maupin says
that he thinks not only
is this new letter a forgery,
trusted to hunt down this killer,
David Toschi.
Maupin, a very well-respected author,
has gone on record saying
that he believes Toschi wrote the letter
to drum up publicity for himself.
Maupin used David
as a character in his column.
David got a kick out of it
and so he wrote
a couple of anonymous letters
asking for the character
to be brought back.
It was like
writing fan mail to himself. That's all.
No, I'm sure that he didn't.
And I'm sure that this will all blow over.
They kicked him out of Homicide.
They made him give his handwriting
like some common criminal.
- May I talk to him?
- No.
if he ever investigated
a man named Rick Marshall?
Is that all you can think about?
Mr. Graysmith,
Maupin works at your paper. We trust...
Dave! Dave!
I'll catch up to you.
You stop calling my house.
Do you understand me?
I just need your help to find Linda.
- Jesus.
- Look, two seconds.
Look, we've been
running handwriting samples.
- Who's we?
- Sherwood and I.
Sherwood?
Sherwood who was fired
from Questioned Documents?
Sherwood who drinks
like Paul Avery now?
- He retired.
- Is that what he told you?
- What, are you saying he's wrong?
- I'm saying stop calling my house.
- We ran them on Rick Marshall.
- No, Robert.
I mean, no, I am not having
this conversation.
But I think that Marshall knew Darlene,
and I can't talk to Mageau or Linda,
so I'm gonna talk to Bob Vaughn.
- Robert. Robert, stop it!
- What?
Okay, the Rick Marshalls
of this world will suck you dry.
They're blind alleys.
But he said he wasn't gonna announce
his murders anymore, Dave.
He was just gonna do them.
Do you know what the chances
of us arresting someone are now?
Too much time has gone by, okay?
Too much of the evidence is lost.
Now, I have been a cop for 25 years.
Murder police for 12.
- What do you do for a living?
- You know what I do for a living.
- You're a cartoonist.
- So what are you saying?
I am saying Zodiac was my job.
It is not yours.
- He's still out there, Dave.
- No, Robert. I am through with this.
I am through with you.
- Okay, which one was that?
- The Lake Tahoe nurse goes missing.
One day before the vernal equinox.
- Dad?
- Yeah. Mark that.
That's got to be
near the summer solstice.
Don't tell Mom about
our special project, okay?
How come you and Mom
don't sleep in the same bed anymore?
Hello.
Mr. Graysmith,
it's Ken Narlow from Napa.
Oh, Captain Narlow.
Thank you for calling me back.
I called you because we've been
cross-referencing lunar cycles
with the Zodiac's timeline.
More often than not, each cycle
since '69 corresponds with an attack
or with one of the letters,
or an unsolved homicide.
- Who's working with you on this?
- Some colleagues.
Dad?
- Ken, can you hold on one second?
- Dad?
- What is it?
- What's this?
In the decade since the Zodiac's
last cipher was received,
every federal agency
has taken a crack at decoding it.
But today,
where those agencies had failed,
Oh, just a lot of books from the library,
and I love puzzles, so I just...
Yeah. The fucking library.
I believe that you can accomplish
anything that you put your mind...
That's a "J"? Okay. Honor Camp?
Thank you so much.
Hey, we found Linda.
She's in jail. Isn't that great?
Why'd you do it?
Because she'll be able to identify Rick...
- What are you talking about?
- You went on TV.
You put yourself out there
for him to see.
Then who's been calling our house
in the middle of the night
at least once a week?
Nobody.
What's it gonna take
for you to be done with this?
I can't talk about this now.
I have to go see Bob Vaughn.
Well, that's too bad,
because we're gonna talk about this.
And when is it gonna be finished?
When you catch him?
When you arrest him?
- Be serious.
- I am serious.
I need to know who he is.
I need to look him in the eye
and I need to know that it's him.
Is that more important
than your family's safety?
Of course not.
Why? Why do you need to do this?
Why?
Because nobody else will.
That's not good enough.
Are you done? Can I go?
- Mr. Vaughn?
- Mr. Graysmith?
- Yes.
- Hi.
You needed to speak to me?
Yes. There's a coffee shop
right on the corner.
- Why don't we just go to my home?
- Oh, I don't wanna put you out.
It's no trouble at all.
- Where are you parked?
- Just right there.
- You can follow me.
- Oh. Okay.
Watch your step.
Come in.
- Very nice house.
- Oh, thank you.
It's very rustic.
- Can I take your jacket?
- No, thank you, I'm fine.
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.
- How about some tea?
- Oh, no, I'm all right.
- You sure?
- Yes.
I wanted to ask you about a film
that the Avenue may have played
while you were the organist there.
Fay Wray, Joel McCrea, Leslie Banks.
We've run that picture many times.
I'd have to check my records. Why?
Do you remember the Zodiac?
- He was a projectionist there, right?
- For a time, yes.
But I have no occasion
to correspond with him these days.
between one of the Zodiac attacks
and that film.
You mean the symbol?
Hold on.
The Zodiac symbol on film.
It's on the countdown.
It's trimmed off each reel
before it's shown,
but it always arrives with it.
Right there.
The first time I saw it in the papers,
I thought about that.
We got a tip
that Rick left a film canister here
that he told you never to open.
A tip about a mysterious film canister?
Is it true?
Yes.
- Did you open it?
- No.
- May I see it?
- Rick took it back in 1972.
This tip is how you got it in your head
that Rick is the Zodiac?
That and the poster.
The poster?
The poster that Rick drew.
The handwriting is the closest
that we have ever come to a match.
- Rick didn't draw any posters.
- No, he drew this one.
That's my handwriting.
I won't take any more of your time.
Why don't I just go and find out
when we played that film?
It's not a problem.
They're just down in the basement.
Not many people
have basements in California.
I do.
The original studio one-sheets,
I always kept for myself.
The cheapo knock-offs
like you brought today
I end up tossing into the back alley.
'69.
You live alone?
nine weeks before
the first Zodiac letter, correct?
Yeah.
Do you think he saw the film
in our theater and was inspired?
Are you sure
there's nobody else in the house?
Would you like
to go upstairs and check?
No.
Thank you. Thanks for everything.
You're welcome.
It's locked.
Thank you.
Two killers. Got to be two killers.
One has the...
Guys?
You've got five minutes.
Linda?
Did you get my note?
- What's this about?
- Zodiac.
Figures.
- You got the look.
- What look?
I didn't mean anything.
Tell me about this painting party.
I told the cops about that so long ago.
Darlene always had
a lot of boys around,
even though she was married.
He used to bring her presents
from Tijuana and...
I don't know why
she was friends with him.
She once told me he'd killed somebody.
Really?
Yeah, I think maybe
when he was in the service.
- Navy?
- I think so.
Was he into movies?
Was he a movie buff?
I can tell you that
he was not into people.
people were supposed to
just show up and drink beer, help paint.
and just sat in a chair
all by himself all night long.
Didn't talk to anyone.
And Darlene told me
to stay away from him.
She was scared of him.
And a couple of weeks later,
she was dead.
I'm sorry. Do you remember his name?
I mean, it was short,
like a nickname, like Stan.
- Rick?
- No, I don't think so.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.
How can you be sure?
It was a long time ago. Think hard.
I am thinking hard.
It was Rick.
- It was Rick. It was Rick Marshall.
- No.
Just say it!
It wasn't Rick.
It was Leigh.
- Leigh?
- Yeah, Leigh.
- Leigh?
- Yeah, Leigh.
Sounds right.
Officer! I need you to let me in.
- Is this an emergency?
- No, I just need to see one file.
No, you need to come back
tomorrow morning.
- One file, just for one second.
- 8:00 a. M., when we're open.
Sergeant! Sergeant Mulanax!
Just give me five minutes.
I know exactly where it is.
Please!
I shouldn't be talking to you.
- You got five minutes.
- Okay.
Here. Here.
Linda states that some of
Darlene's closest friends are Leigh,
who used to bring Darlene
presents from Tijuana.
- So what?
- He knew her.
Linda said Leigh. This is Leigh.
No. That's just one name in a file
that contains hundreds.
It's nothing.
- Dave Toschi...
- Agrees with me.
Our investigation
into this subject is over.
I'm sorry.
Hello.
Who's there?
- You didn't return my calls.
- Oh, I've been kind of busy.
Yeah. I can see that.
How's the book coming?
I tried to send you these.
I heard.
When's the last time
you ate something?
Nothing makes sense anymore.
- Did it ever?
- Yeah, it did.
Robert, it was just the date
that didn't end.
You don't mean that.
A little.
The kids miss you.
- I can't have them see me like this.
- Neither can I.
but finish this.
Dave!
Dave! It's Robert!
- Dave!
- Is he actually here?
I'm gonna kill him.
I'm calling SFPD. Where's my gun?
Dave!
Robert! Go away!
Dave! He made a mistake!
- Get away from the window.
- I'll meet you around front.
- You have to hear this!
- No, I don't, Robert!
The birthday was the one time
that he was weak!
The one time
that he gave something away!
- Robert, I am calling the police.
- It's Arthur Leigh Allen!
Where did you get that name?
He called the Bellis' house.
December '69.
"I need to kill. Today's my birthday. "
It was his birthday.
Arthur Leigh Allen
was born on December 18th.
Get in here.
- Here you go.
- Thanks.
the only one who ever wrote me
a letter was Leigh Allen.
He was arrested January 1975
for molestation.
He sent me that when he got out.
"Dear Dave, if I can ever be
of any help to you, just let me know.
"I'm sorry I wasn't your man. "
And it's typewritten.
Using a typewriter is not a crime.
And he knew Darlene.
It's in the Vallejo files.
Mulanax said that
he was your favorite suspect.
That you spent two years on him,
and that nobody ever came close.
All the evidence said no.
Sherwood disqualified his handwriting.
The same Sherwood
that drinks like Paul Avery now?
Yes, you have Sherwood Morrill
in writing saying,
- But you also have Terry Pascoe...
- His protégé.
but he's a handwriting expert
nonetheless, and he's saying,
"Do not disqualify this suspect
on the basis of handwriting. "
"Do not disqualify this suspect
on the basis of handwriting. "
- So the two cancel each other out.
- No, they don't.
It was Sherwood's case.
He was the head
of Questioned Documents.
all the defense would have to do
is call Sherwood to the stand.
And there was no way of getting Allen
into court in the first place,
What do you mean,
there's no evidence?
You have him seen with the ciphers.
The military boot prints.
The same size shoes and gloves.
The Most Dangerous Game.
The Zodiac watch.
The background with school children.
The misspellings of Christ-mass.
The bloody knives.
All circumstantial.
We should have found
one of those things in that trailer.
- We didn't.
- That's...
Okay. Catherine Allen states that
"Leigh cleaned out his trailer
on Friday after work
"and moved it to Santa Rosa
on Saturday, August 7th, 1971."
You interviewed him
at the refinery on August 4th.
- Yeah.
- So, he's cleaning out his trailer,
he's moving into a different county
Okay. Okay.
Look at the stuff side by side, Dave.
All right.
Okay, Arthur Leigh Allen
and the Zodiac, their timelines.
- When was the first murder in Vallejo?
- Christmas, 1968.
Eight months before that,
Allen is fired for molesting his students
and his family discovers
that he's a pedophile.
- Now, when do the letters begin?
- July, '69.
After the murder of Darlene Ferrin.
And they continue
until you go to see him at work.
Now, after that, do any of the letters
contain swatches of Paul Stine's shirt?
No. Because he dumped them,
because he got scared.
Because he knew
that you were on to him.
- So, when's the next letter from Zodiac?
- Not until January of 1974.
He is silent for three years.
because everybody's moved off
Allen as a suspect.
And what do we get?
Three new letters from Zodiac
in January, May, and July in '74.
- But then the letters stop.
- What happens to Allen?
He's arrested.
January, 1975,
they send him to Atascadero.
We don't get another letter from Zodiac
the entire time he's there.
- When is he released?
- August, '77.
Allen gets out. He types you an apology,
and then what?
We get our first new Zodiac letter
in four years.
Okay. Zodiac had to have known
Darlene Ferrin, right?
Yes, because of the phone calls
on the night of her murder.
we know that Darlene knew
a man named Leigh?
Yes.
how can you be sure that Leigh Allen
is the Leigh from this file?
Now, Vallejo is a small town,
but it's not that small.
How do you put
the two of them together?
This is a case that's covered
both Northern and Southern California,
with victims and suspects
spread over hundreds of miles.
- Would you agree?
- Yes.
Darlene Ferrin worked
at the Vallejo House of Pancakes
on the corner of Tennessee and Caroll.
Arthur Leigh Allen lived in his
mother's basement on Fresno Street.
Is that true?
I've walked it.
Jesus Christ.
So?
- I'm not asking you as a cop.
- But I am a cop.
I can't prove this.
Just because you can't prove it,
doesn't mean it's not true.
Finish the book.
Thank you. Thank you for breakfast.
Can I help you?
No.
Mr. Mageau.
Thanks for coming to see me.
You're the one I talked to on the phone?
I'm George Bawart. Vallejo PD.
I took over for Jack Mulanax.
It's been 22 years.
I don't know how I can help you.
I'm gonna show you
a group of photographs.
Now, the person that shot you
may or may not be
among these photographs.
You don't have to pick anybody out
just because I'm showing you
these pictures, you understand?
All right.
Take your time.
If you don't recognize anyone,
that's okay.
That's him.
How sure are you?
He had a round face like this guy.
Wait. Am I to understand
that you're now identifying
the second photograph?
No, no. Just that
he had a round face like that.
It's this man.
All right.
Now, on a scale of one to 10,
how sure are you?
At least an eight.
The last time I saw this face
was July 4th, 1969.
I am very sure
that's the man who shot me.
