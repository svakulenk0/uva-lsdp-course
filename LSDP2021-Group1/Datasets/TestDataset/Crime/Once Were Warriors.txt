It's so much soul
Who's got the souls
of Rolling Stones?
On the road that's cold
What do we do? We G-a-b
With the groove,

With the rhythm completely
Jump on the mike, I bet
We got soul,

So come, come, come,

So much soul
We're young, we're hip
Get up, get up, get up,

Come on, man.
Let's go.
We've got soul
We've got soul

He's got soul
I got it, you got it
Here we go, here we go
You got it
Your mouth's
ready to blow again
Making sure, jack...
"Reihi was a Taniwha.
"She lived at the bottom
of a huge lake.
"She spent most of her time
"taking care of
a greenstone wall.
"The wall
stopped the water
"from flooding
over the people
"who lived
by Reihi's lake.
"Once a month,
the people would bring
"a huge piece
of greenstone
to help Reihi
keep the wall strong."
...especially
if you drive around
the big towns, people.
Hope you love my wife,
you know...
I was just
checking out
the weather
situation.
A few showers as well
and light winds
at first,
but it's going to be
getting better
throughout the day
and the night...
A bit of cloud
and a bit of rain as well.
People, I've just had
a phone call from Darren.
Now, apparently, Darren's
just lost his girlfriend.
Brother...
I'd say we are
in business, my man.
What's happening,
everybody?
Aah!
Settle down!
"Then the children
would run and laugh
"Then the children
would run and laugh
as they collected all the fish
Reihi had left for them."
Was it a good story,
kids?
Well, I liked it.
No. It's dumb.
What's a Taniwha?
It's a creature
that looks after people.
Where the fuck is everyone?!
What are you doing home?
I got something for you.
Come on, Hu,
let's go!
What do you reckon,
kids?
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
Oh, yum!
Oh, Jake!
Look at
all the kai moana!
Bloody oceans
of the stuff!
- I'm hungry!
- Me, too!
Go on, kids.
Grab some.
Take it outside.
Come on, Hu.
Got to eat them
outside.
Where the fuck you off to?
Come have a feed, boy.
No.
Fuck him.
Jake, not on
the table, hon.
Oh, why not?
I want a feed.
Well, the kids
might come in.
Well, what about
the chair?
Remember?
So...
where did all
the seafood come from?
I got lucky.
I got laid off.
What?
Whoa, whoa, woman.
Let me finish.
Jake Heke, you've got
a family to feed.
You've got bills.
Look, I've signed up
for the dole.
It's only 17 bucks a week
less than my wages.
Well, don't look like that.
It's not the end of the worid.
What about
our house?
We got a house,
and the government ain't
going to kick us out.
The rent's cheap.
I want us to have
our own home, Jake.
Damn you. We can't make
bloody ends meet as it is.
Forget the bloody house.
Let's talk about
the bedroom.
Oh, don't, Jake!
You fucking got to spoil
everything, don't you?
Fuck you!
Ooh, yeah,
ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah
Scoo da da do wa oh
Ooh, I left this mark
on this worid
Ooh, yeah,
ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah
Scoo da da do wa oh
Yo, Toot.
Yo, G.
What you up to?
Oh, you know, a bit
of this and the other.
You never know when
the Queen might drop by.
Well, if she does,
here's something to feed her.
Bloody Santa Claus!
Do you think we'll ever
get out of here, Toot?
I don't know.
Maybe.
You know,
when I'm old enough
to get the dole,
I might just do this baby up
and drive on out.
Can I come, too?
Of course.
You're my best mate.
Hey, Gracie, did you
bring your book?
Oh, I forgot.
I just finished
a new story, too,
but I can remember
most of it.
Choice!
The story was about
a Taniwha.
Do you know
what a Taniwha is?
Well,
Reihi was a Taniwha.
She lived at the bottom
of this lake.
Now, she spent
most of her time
looking after this huge
greenstone wall.
The wall stopped
the water
from flooding
over the people
who lived
by Reihi's lake.
Once a month,
the people would bring...
Beth Heke?
What now?
Been keeping
bad company.
Was that before or after
you picked him up?
So what's
the charge?
Oh, he's lucky
this time.
Two older boys
stole the car.
He's just hanging around
with the wrong crowd.
Still, it's not going
to look good tomorrow
when he appears in court
on those other charges.
You think you know everything
about us, don't you?
It's my job.
Is she a Taniwha, Mom?
No, son.
Well, we'll leave
Boogie with you, then.
- Mark.
- Pardon?
My son's name
is Mark.
Well, that's not
the name he gave us.
You get those
Ionely, Ionely
Lonely, Ionely
blues
When you're
on your own
Mm-hmm
So all you've
got to do
Is call up
on the phone
No need to be
alone
Mm-hmm
And if you lose
your way
And you've got
nowhere to go...
The usual.
What's your
fucking problem?
The man can sure
pack a punch.
He's been
behind bars, I bet.
Yeah, right.
Bloody zoo.
If I wanted to drink
with women,
I'd drink in the bloody
lounge bar, huh?
I've had women
up to here.
Come on, Polly.
Help your sister.
Set the table, girl.
There are reports
that they've had
at least one sighting
of the Virgin.
Oh, no wonder
we got it...
Why, Boog?
Don't know.
You don't know?
Do you know
you have to go
to court tomorrow?
Do you remember
what Bennett said?
Jeez, Boog, what's
bloody wrong with you?
Don't know.
When you were a kid,
you wouldn't even take
a piece of fruit
without asking.
You're going to come
tomorrow, aren't you, Mom?
Yes, we'll be there.
Will you?
Yeah. Just keep
your hands
in your pockets
there, brother.
Come on, bro. I'd just
like to see them smile.
Oh, you mean
like this?
You dirty bastard.
I can make mine
smile all right.
I just can't make
the woman happy.
I took a big feed
of seafood home today...
bloody everything.
Just wanted to put
a smile on her face.
You think she'd let me?
No chance.
All I told her
was I got laid off.
Anyone would have
thought I told her
that my prick dropped off.
Laid off twice
in one day, eh, bro?
Poor bastard.
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
You're leaving home
in the morning
You come on home
in the night
Ooh, babe...
Fucking beautiful.
And when
I ask you, babe
You just say,
you're right
But you don't know
What my heart's
been going through
Staying up late
Just waitin' on you
When will you be
the one for me?
Oh, yeah,
without your love
I can't make it
You're all...
Gee, where did you
get those muscles from?
Bro, you've been lifting
those weights, huh?
What, you've done lag?
Am I right?
You want to
fuck with me?
You should learn
to pay your respects.
In case you want
to know, it's Jake...
Jake the Muss.
Mmm, loving you
is all I need, boy
I was right... too much weights,
not enough speed work.
Useless prick.
Cheers.
Into me
Am I not enough
for you...
Party at my place
tonight, boys.
Come on, Poll. Bed.
Come on, Hu.
Hurry up, Polly.
Thanks, Bub.
Good night, Mum.
Night-night, Polly.
You, too, mister.
You've got a big day
tomorrow.
You won't forget, eh, Mum?
How can I forget
with you reminding me
every 5 minutes?
Good night, son.
Good night, Mum.
Whoo-hoo!
Whoo-hoo!
Your old man was
sure swinging tonight.
He'll be swinging,
all right,
by the time
I've finished with him.
Did you hear
he got the sack?
Doesn't surprise me,
girl...
days he took off.
Beth, babe.
Dooley!
You should have seen
the Muss in action.
It was beautiful.
He decked
a bloody gorilla.
He was big.
Man, was he big.
Fucking huge.
It has to be said...
almost as big as that
thing in Bully's pants.
Notice he said
almost, ladies?
Yeah, right.
Hey, girl, you should have
seen him, though.
Dool's right...
big...
and bloody ugly.
Well, he didn't get
everything right, though.
Well, it's just that Bully
isn't that big, girl.
- Whoo!
- Whoo!
Mmm, you're hot
tonight, girl.
Yeah, ever since Jake
put his hand
halfway up my skirt.
Ooh, I might have to
go home early tonight.
Yo, Mave.
Give us a song.
Come on, Mave!
How about you and Beth
sing for me?
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
OK, OK, OK.
Give us a G.
Give us a G.
Well, I've tried
- Whoo!
- Whoo!
As hard as I can
Just to make you
Understand
'Cause the worid
It won't stop
It keeps goin'
Goin'
round and round
I guess the nature
The nature of love
Hurts always, always
What are you doing?
Couldn't you sleep,
either?
Aren't they beautiful
when they're like that?
I wish I could see them.
I remember
They're just drunk.
That's all.
All those
yesterdays
People show their true feelings
when they're drunk.
Understanding
Man, Gracie, you've got
some far-out ideas.
I thought Mum said
you were growing up.
At least I'm not going
to court tomorrow.
Oh, sorry, Boog.
I didn't mean it.
Oh, what the hell.
What's the worst
that can happen?
The nature of love
And it's always,
always been this way
So, now, my lover
There'll be no other
The stars
in the heavens
Will shine forever
Moments we treasure
You and I in love
So, darlin'
Here is my heart
So, darlin'
Here is my heart
So, darlin'
Here is my heart
Ohh
Yeah
- Whoo!
- Whoo!
You're a hard lady,
Bethie.
And you're
a hard man, Jakey.
Play another one,
someone.
Next time,
watch what you say
in front of
the fucking women!
How's that
for true feelings?
Oh, don't play
that shit, friend.
Play something
we all know.
Later!
Have a feed.
Have a feed.
Have a feed.
Hey, Mavis, come have
a drink with me, mate!
What's up with
bloody Millie?
Is she spoiling
the party, or what?
Too much gin
and not enough sex.
Hey, hey, hey.
I'm not going to
miss out tonight.
Dooley, eh?
Strike when the pants
are ready to drop.
Looks like they've
already dropped, Mave.
Never mind him, Mave.
Come have a feed.
There's still a bit left
in the bottom.
Dooley, what the fuck
are you doing?
You're with me!
Got any money?
Money?
What for?
You don't need money.
You got everything
you want right here.
You got booze, food.
The old man.
Don't give me
your bullshit excuses!
Come on. Let's go.
Have a drink with me, son.
Remember how we used to
talk and laugh?
We could talk and talk,
you and me.
Remember?
You're drunk.
I'm not drunk.
I'm happy.
Then you're out of
your fuckin' head.
Oh, I'm so sorry,
babe.
I didn't... hang on.
Hang on, son.
I got some money.
Hey, cook us
some eggs, eh, Beth?
Ooh, and some bacon.
Fuck off!
What the fuck's
going on?
I asked for
some eggs, but...
Cook the man
some eggs.
You want eggs?
Well, have the bloody
lot of them!
It's OK, man.
Cook the man
some fucking eggs.
Do it yourself, Jake!
I'm not the fuckin' slave
around here, Jake!
No, you can...
You're a fuckin' coward!
Leave her alone,
you fucking bastard!
Stop it!
Stop it!
It's OK, Poll.
Shh! Shh!
Shush, Hu.
Shh!
I want Mummy!
It's OK, Poll.
You'll be OK
tomorrow.
Your fuckin' mouth!
You do as you're fucking told!
Fuck. Last time,
I got 20 bucks.
So what are you
up to, Gracie?
You could help.
Not me.
Waste of bloody time.
You should leave it.
There'll be plenty of time
for you to clean up
after drunken
fucking parties.
What do you mean?
When you
get married, girl.
Who said I want to?
It's just the way
things are.
No. The fellas around here
are too ugly.
It's just a matter
of time, Gracie.
Who did the prick
smack over?
The fuckin' bastard!
Where are you going?
Out of this
fuckin' hole!
They've eaten
the whole lot.
I'm hungry.
How about
some Chinese?
Yuck!
Where's Mum?
Well, she's not
bloody here, is she?
Look, there's
one more pea.
Yeah,
I know, Boog.
Do you want
an aspirin?
Listen, Boog...
Grace can go with you, eh?
Give a good impressión.
I'm not feeling
the best, son.
Just give me time
to wash up.
Nothing that a good
coffee won't fix.
I'll catch
a later bus.
OK, Boog?
We love the reggae giris,
we love the reggae giris
The reggae music make you
jump and stomp, yes
The reggae music make you
dance and prance, yes
So everybody come
and shake your butt, yes
'Cause this the music,
and I'm the best, yes
And this is something
that they must confess, yes...
Do you reckon
we should go in?
Nah. Wait for Mum.
Come on, son.
We're running late.
Didn't I tell you I was
picking you up this morning?
Forgot.
Come on.
Bit of trouble
at your place
last night.
Look, Mark,
I have to be honest.
You're on remand.
The cops say they
found you on the streets.
They're going to try
and persuade the judge
that your parents
can't control you.
I've seen your mother.
I don't think
she's going to make it here
this morning.
She's going to
catch a later bus.
- Morning.
- Hi.
Mark, you ready?
Better go in.
Come on.
Nig Heke, eh?
Son of Jake the Muss.
You a bit of a chip off
the old block, boy?
I'm nothing like him.
Yeah, we'll see.
So today's
the day, boy.
Judgment day.
How bad
do you want in?
Didn't hear you, boy.
I want a patch.
You hear that, brothers?
He wants a patch.
You'll have to get
through me first.
Do all right
with women, boy?
I do all right.
Must be your
flashy smile, eh?
Value your teeth?
You like your
pretty-boy face.
Call you
Michael Jackson,
except we'll
rearrange it for free.
You think
about that, boy,
before you think
about any patch.
Is that right, Mark?
You admit
to the burglaries?
And what about these
motor-vehicle charges?
Will you be
withdrawing those?
Yes, your honor,
but we recommend
that Mark goes into
social welfare custody.
Take your hat off,
please, sergeant.
We picked him up
yesterday.
Sir, it's pretty clear
that his parents
can't look after him.
And, um...
what do you two have?
I'm in a difficult position.
I've had no contact
with Mark's parents, and...
Yes, well, I was hoping
the boy's mother
would be here today.
I was around there
this morning,
and after what I saw...
I don't think Mark
should be at home.
Yes. Yes.
All right.
Things seem to be going
from bad to worse
for you, don't they,
Mark?
Under the circumstances,
if your parents can't
control you,
I'll have to remand you
in social welfare custody.
Nig Heke's
brother.
Looks like a fucking
poofter to me.
Baby, you can fuck
with me any day.
Now, you can either
do this the hard way,
or you can make it
work for you.
- It's your choice.
- What do you mean?
You can let me
help you,
and you might learn
something,
or you could end up
in jail.
Because that's where
you're heading.
Sorry to interrupt.
Can I see you a moment?
Uh, yeah.
I'll see you outside.
Please try, Boog.
It can't be
that bad, eh?
At least you'll be doing
something different.
Hey, I could even
write to you.
I've never had anyone
to write to before.
Gee, girl, you
started without me.
Jeez, woman,
is that the result
of one hell of
an orgasm or what?
What the hell
happened?
Same old story.
Never learn to keep
my mouth shut.
Help yourself
to a beer.
Ah, what the hell.
Surprised there's
any left.
Well, you know
the rules, girl.
Keep your mouth shut
and your legs open.
Didn't get
to court, then, eh?
Like this?
Do more harm
than good.
Welfare came round
this morning.
Promised Boog
I'd be there for him.
That boy's got to learn
to stand on his own two feet.
You're going to
have to take a chain saw
to those apron
strings, girl.
He's not strong
like the others, Mave.
Ah, shit. I remember
when he was a wee fella.
Couldn't tear him
off you.
He'll be all right.
It's Nig
I'd worry about.
It doesn't seem
like that long ago
that Nig was a baby.
Well, he's not a baby
anymore,
that's for sure!
Jeez, you should have
seen Jake, Mave,
boasting about
his baby boy...
till Nig started
crying at night.
That's about when those
two parted company.
Ain't that the truth?
Bloody men.
Jeez, he was
a beautiful baby, Mave.
Oh, enough bloody
talk, girl.
Hit the fella
over the head!
Tell him to wake
his ideas up.
Bloody gangs.
Kati!
So how
you doing, boy?
The brothers
can't hear you, boy.
Timata!
Kati!
Brother,
now you've met
your new family.
I wanted to be
there, Grace.
I couldn't.
They'd have
sent him away.
You've seen
the state of me, Bub.
They did.
They did, Mum.
They sent Boog
away.
But how can
they do that...
just take
someone's son away?
It's OK, Mum.
Boog seemed OK.
He should be
at home with us.
Can't a man get some
fuckin' sleep around here?
Fuck, woman,
you look fucking awful.
Go clean yourself up.
This is as cleaned up
as I get,
you bastard.
Tried getting cleaned up
all morning
so I could go to court
with our son.
Our son, Jake!
What the fuck's
Nig been up to?
You have
no idea, do you?
Boogie!
Boogie?
Is that right?
He's gone, Jake.
He's gone to welfare,
and you slept
through the whole
bloody thing.
Is that all?
Is that what all this
slamming of fucking doors,
crying, and carrying on
is about?
Fuck!
The boy is soft.
It'll toughen him up.
Anyone would think
he bloody died or something.
Hey, so go do something
about the way you look.
You're starting to
make me feel fucking sick.
You did this to me,
you bastard.
I hope you spew
your guts out.
You know your fucking
problem, eh, woman?
You're too
bloody lippy,
too bloody
smart-mouthed.
You're a bad example
for the fucking kids.
Always writing, aren't you?
Too fucking smart.
You'll end up like
your mother here.
I hate him.
Bring your book
here, Bub.
What you been
writing?
I was going to
write to Boog.
You got a good
nature, girl.
Mr. Bennett said
we could visit.
It's all right
for those fellas.
They've got everything
at their fingertips...
flashy car,
plenty of money.
Easy for them.
Knew we couldn't.
I didn't say
we couldn't.
It just won't be easy.
Got to find
the money.
Do you think we could?
Yes, I do.
I promise.
I love you, Mum.
I love you,
too, Bub.
Hey, Gracie.
Come and suck
on this.
You fellas
are too ugly.
Did you hear?
Boog got sent away.
Yeah, I heard.
Boys' home, right?
- You want a puff?
- Nah.
Well, yeah.
Why not?
He's going to be
OK, though.
And you know why?
Because Mum said
we can visit...
you know,
as a family.
Isn't that choice?
Yeah. Yeah.
Choice.
What do you think
it'll be like?
What?
The boys' home?
Got to be better
than this car.
You going to
hold on to that
till it goes out?
Oh. Sorry.
You're the only one
I can talk to.
You know that, Toot?
Yeow, G.
Best mates...
forever.
Fuckin' beautiful.
Fuckin' tin-ass.
Must be your shout,
eh, bro?
Yeah, all right,
all right.
Well,
bloody hell.
I should have brought
the video camera.
Get out
and stay out,
you fucking
bastard!
Hey, Muss.
Have a win on
the Gigis, Muss?
Look at the bloody
state of you, man.
You're a fucking mess.
Don't you ever speak
to me again, you hear?
You might
spoil my night.
Good evening, ladies.
I've just had
a bit of a windfall,
and since you're looking
so bloody beautiful,
I thought I might buy
you gals a drink,
especially the one
standing here
in his fucking
party dress.
Barman, 6 milk shakes, eh?
Easy on the ice cream.
Ooh. Forget it, lady.
You looked better
before you turned around.
Fuck, boy,
you're too much.
If you want to be
like your old man,
learn how to stand
on your own two feet.
Fuck. Is that
your old man?
Piss off.
I don't have an old man.
You're still a bloody
attractive woman.
You mean after you
take to me with your fists?
You make me sick.
Oh, hon, you still
on about the other week?
I told you,
I'm sorry.
And I told you
when I get like that,
get out of my way.
But you have to get
all lippy on me.
I got a temper on me,
but who hasn't?
You're priceless.
Well, at least
I try to make it up
to you.
Get off me, Jake.
Oh, you're a hard lady.
Hey, where do you think
you're going?
Sit down
and keep a man company.
I've got things
to think about.
Like what?
Since when
were you interested?
Well, if you can't tell
by the way
I just grabbed you,
I must be
losing my touch.
If you're not gonna take me
seriously, Jake...
Take it easy.
Talk to Jakey.
It's just...
It's just what?
Jeez,
you're pretty.
I want us
to visit Boogie.
Is that all?
Go together,
as a family.
You know,
make a day of it,
take up a nice
picnic lunch.
Maybe we could rent
a car for the day.
Oh, yeah. Maybe we could
fuckin' fly.
It's not impossible, Jake.
I've worked it out.
There's the money Auntie Matawai
sent me at Christmas.
If I put a bit
aside each week
from the housekeeping,
in a month,
maybe we could go.
Please, Jake?
And this whole day
means a lot to you, huh?
Yes.
Book the fuckin'
limousine.
Horses, babe.
Honest.
Now, will you
come here?
Tell Jakey
you love him.
That's the trouble,
Jake. I do.
What's going on?
It's Heke, sir.
He's got your
taiaha, sir.
If you want to smash
things, boy,
you start with me!
You think you're man enough
to hold a taiaha, boy?
I hate
this fucking place!
You're not supposed
to like it!
Let me go,
you black bastard!
We are the same
color, boy!
The British used to think
the bayonet
was the most lethal
of all hand-to-hand
combat weapons,
till they came across
our warriors,
who fought
with a taiaha.
You think your fist
is your weapon?
When I have
taught you,
your mind will be.
You'll carry your
taiaha inside you.
Come on.
Whoa, this is
the life, eh, kids?
Don't even have to
change gears.
Want to come and visit
your brother, son?
Nah. Got something
else on.
Oh, come on, son...
as a family.
to visit your
own brother, boy?
Rather be with a pack
of wankers.
He would have come, Jake,
if you would have waited.
He would have.
Visits don't start
till after lunch.
We may as well take
a drive, eh, kids?
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
What's the time,
Mr. Wolf?
What's the time?
What's the time,
Mr. Wolf?
What's the time?
What's the time,
Mr. Wolf?
What's the time?
What's the time,
Mr. Wolf?
What's the time?
I said 1:00
Spooly, spooly,
spooly ooly dooly booly
wee, wee, oh
What's the time,
Mr. Wolf?
What's the time?
What's the time, Mr. Wolf?
What's the time?
What's that place
over there, Mum?
Taku Whenua Tuturu.
My piece of dirt.
That's where I was
brought up, kids.
What's that big house
over there, Mum?
That's the Wharenui.
It was a lot different
when I was a girl.
It was always
impressive.
What's
impressive?
Choice.
It was
always choice.
And inside
are the most
choicest carvings.
Oh, and inside
are photos
of the old people
and the Tukutuku
panels.
You know, I used to
help Nannie
and Auntie Matawai
repair them.
Well, why don't we
ever go there, Mum?
One day we'll all
end up there.
See over there
to the right?
That's the Urupa...
the family cemetery.
All my family
are buried there.
I'd love to go
and see them.
Not before me,
you don't.
Your father and I
were going to get
hitched there.
Except we didn't.
I wasn't bloody
good enough...
not for their
royal highness.
Tell them everything,
why don't you?
Your mother
was beautiful...
pride
of the fucking tribe...
And this old
black-ass comes along
and steals her away.
And you know where
I come from, kids?
A long line of slaves.
Fucking slaves.
I'd like to see
those wankers
call Jake the Muss
that now.
Ah, this place
gives me the creeps.
Come on, kids.
Doesn't give me
the creeps.
You never met
my grandmother.
Eh, Jake?
Just want to show
our flash car to my mates.
Whoa, bro,
you know what
the penalty is
for car theft?
Just one beer, huh?
One, Jake.
Just the one.
Promise?
Cross my heart.
Cheer.
Cheer.
Ah, cheer.
Cheer, bro.
Cheer.
Cheer.
How long is Dad
gonna be?
I'd get that tone
out of your voice
if I were you.
How many times have
you seen your father
like today, Grace?
Never...
that's how many,
so just give him
a chance, eh?
Now running on the track,
it's Robin the Fair...
Bethie!
Name your poison.
Oh, no, thanks,
Dooley.
Jake and I are going to
visit our son Boogie.
Aren't we, Jake?
Yeah, yeah.
Just a minute.
I'm trying to listen
to the horse race.
You promised, Jake.
Shut up, woman.
You'll make me miss
who won the fuckin' race.
The kids are hungry.
Well, feed them.
You got bootloads
of the stuff.
We'll be waiting.
Come on, come on.
Come up, come up.
So he's not coming?
Oh, he's coming,
all right.
You're hopeful.
No, Grace.
It's just a woman's
lot, that's all.
One day
you'll understand.
No, no, no,
no, no, no.
Stop, stop.
It's good, but it's
not good enough!
I've told you fellas
time and again,
this haka won't work
until you get
the first action right!
You're reaching up
for all these ancestral lines,
and you're pulling them
down into your body!
The weight
of your ancestors.
Some of you look
as though you're reaching
for butterflies
or something.
Now, let's do it again...
and wake up!
And I in love
So, darling,
here is my heart
Give me
the keys, Jake.
I said, give me
the keys.
What for?
I'm going to
visit Boogie.
Bad idea.
The problem is
you've spoiled the boy.
You've got to
toughen him up.
Give me
the bloody keys!
That's it, woman.
Just fuck off!
Take a bloody taxi.
You got all my
bloody money.
Fuck.
I remember
All those yesterdays
We'll walk around
to the taxi stand.
Taxi? What for?
We're going home.
No. We're going
to see Boogie.
You promised.
Please, Grace,
try to understand.
I don't want to listen
to any more of your lies.
I hate you!
I hate you both!
Come on, kids.
Boogie? Son?
We were
on our way.
We rented a car
for the trip.
We had a bit
of an accident, son.
Oh, well, you know
what your father's like
when he gets
behind the wheel.
Had a picnic lunch
all prepared.
Stayed up all last night.
I got in
just what you like.
It was just
a stupid accident.
Whoa. Party at
my place tonight, boys.
- Hello!
- Hey!
Fuck. I need to piss.
Thanks, mate.
We really needed
to know that.
Bethie, you awake?
Come party with us.
No.
No more, Jake.
I could tell
straightaway
it was a holding.
What's more, it's
my mate's holding.
Next thing I know,
I give him a smack.
Oh, if it isn't
Gracie.
Hu wanted
some water.
Come and give
your uncle a kiss.
You're growing up
fast, girl.
She's in bed,
where you should be.
What happened then,
Jake?
He comes back at me
with this crowbar.
Yeah? And then what?
I take the crowbar
off him
and give him
another smack.
Good night, Hu.
Night-night.
Shh. Shh.
It's OK, Gracie.
Uncle Bully is going
to be gentle with you...
as gentle as a lamb.
Shh.
Shh. Shh.
Your mum and dad
are going to be
real angry at you,
turning me on
like that...
coming downstairs
in nothing
but that flimsy
little nightie.
Shh, shh, shh.
It's our secret,
hey, Gracie?
You hear me, girl?
Keep your mouth shut.
Did Huata wet
the bed again, Bub?
You should have
left it.
I'd have
done that.
Just go away.
Go away.
Look, I don't
blame you, Grace.
I wanted
to see Boogie
as much as you.
You don't care
about any of us.
That's not true.
I love you all.
But you're a liar!
Go on...
got your period, Bub.
It's bound to make you
a bit uptight...
Get out! Get out!
What's
for breakfast?
You want something
to eat,
fix it yourself.
Give me a coffee.
Go and have
a wash, Jake.
Clean your ears out
while you're at it.
What the fuck's
up with you?
I'm not going to
take this anymore.
Do you hear me,
Jake Heke?
No more.
We never
got to see Boogie.
I don't want any more
of these drunken parties
or your bloody ugly
mongrel mates coming around.
It's no good...
no good for the kids,
especially now Grace
is growing.
Who the fuck do you
think you are, eh?
Sitting there like
Lady Bloody Muck,
telling me
in my own house
who I can
and can't have here.
Well, I've asked
them back tonight,
and you'd better
be ready for it.
Do you hear me?!
Now, get off
your fat ass
and get busy.
Oh, Grace!
You know,
that's your problem.
You spoil
the lot of them!
No wonder they're all
so fucking screwed up!
It's got nothing
to do with you,
eh, Jake Heke?
You're such
good father material!
You chased Nig off!
You couldn't give a damn
about Boogie!
You're not gonna
hurt my babies anymore...
not while I can do
something about it.
Oh, you want
something to eat?
Learn how to cook.
Grace!
Grace!
What's up?
I said, what's up?
How long have you
been sitting there?
Why is everything
so black, Toot?
Don't know.
Maybe 'cause we're
all bloody Maoris.
You got something...
you got something
to sniff?
Yeah. A couple
of old socks.
What's going on, G?
I thought you said
we were best friends.
If you're too bloody mean,
just forget it.
Hang on. Hang on.
No glue, OK? OK?
But I've got
some dope.
You want
some of that?
What's going on
with you, Bub?
What colors are you
seeing now, G?
Still all black?
Not an old black
in sight.
Notice how you never see black
in a rainbow, do you?
Just bright colors.
Must be their pot.
You know, the pot at
the end of the thing.
Oh, dumb.
Pot... the end
of the thing.
You're just like
everyone else around here.
I'm... I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it.
You're just
a stupid kid
that lives in
an old wreck of a car.
G! G! Come back, G!
G, come back!
What did I do?
Please, G!
I'm sorry!
Please.
This is the day
that the Lord has made
That the Lord
has made
We will rejoice
We will rejoice
and be glad in it
And be glad in it
Whoa, for this
is the day
That the Lord
has made
We will rejoice
and be glad in it
This is the day,
this is the day
That the Lord
has made
That the Lord
has made
That the Lord
has made
We will rejoice
We will rejoice
and be glad in it
And be glad
in it
This is the day
That the Lord
has made
We will rejoice
and be glad in it
This is the day,
this is the day
That the Lord
has made
Shit. It's nearly
on empty.
I've got money.
Forget the money.
It's just no good.
We've been driving
around for hours.
When was the last time
you phoned home?
Uh, about 9:00.
Jeez.
It's nearly 11:00.
I've got those
Lonely, Ionely, Ionely,
Ionely blues
Lonely, Ionely, Ionely,
Ionely blues
I've got those
Lonely, Ionely, Ionely,
Ionely blues
Lonely, Ionely blues
Look what she done,
what she done, my baby
Bring your ass
in here, girl!
Look what she done...
I said in here!
Move!
Your mother's
been out
all day, half
the fucking night!
Now, where the fuck
you been?
Come on, bro,
she's home now.
Let the kid
go to bed.
Come on, Jake.
Play the guitar, man.
Go on.
Piss off to bed.
Hey, come on, give
your Uncle Bully
a kiss good night.
I don't want to.
What? I didn't
hear you.
I said I don't want to.
What, you got
a hearing problem, girl?
Hey, no. Leave it.
Daddy, no!
Daddy!
I told you
about this thing, eh?
No fucking wonder
you don't do
what you're
fucking told!
Take it easy, Jake.
She's just a kid.
Go on.
Get out of here.
Bully,
play us a song.
Go on, dude.
Look what she done,
what she done, my baby
Look what she done,
what she done, my baby
Look what she done...
Stop your panic,
woman.
She's home.
She won't be
taking off anymore.
Where is she, Jake?
She pissed off
out the back.
What the fuck?
Aah! Aah! Oh! Oh!
Some-someone help me
get her down!
Please! Please!
Come on, baby.
Come on, girl.
It's all right,
baby.
Mummy's home.
Mummy's home.
Come on, Grace.
Oh, God.
We've got to
do something.
My baby!
I'll get help.
No, Grace!
Don't cry, Mavis.
Doesn't do any good.
Auntie Matawai?
It's Beth.
Ka mata oku
tamahine...
last night.
I want to bring her
home, Auntie.
Will you come
and get us, please?
Thank you.
We're going to
play spacies.
Come on, you two.
Oh, where's Gracie?
She's having
a long sleep.
No, she's not.
Her bed's empty.
That's enough, Polly.
Come on.
What the fuck's
going on here?
I want us to take
Grace back home
to the Marae.
This is
her fucking home.
No, it's not.
This was
never her home...
never.
And that
fucking place is?
Fucking Maoris
who think they're better
than the rest of us?
I hate them.
Bastards living
in the fucking past.
It's our past, too, Jake.
What's that
supposed to mean?
I want Grace to be
with her people.
We should have gone back
a long time ago.
Fuck off!
You're not
taking her anywhere.
I'm taking her, Jake,
with or without you.
I wasn't there
when Grace needed me.
This time
I'm going to do
the right thing
by her,
and you're not
going to stop me.
You fucking do,
and I won't be here
when you get back.
Well, go on, then.
Go! Get the hell
out of here!
I'm taking her.
I'll kill you first!
Well, go on. Do it.
You're still
a slave, Jake...
to your fists,
to the drink,
to yourself.
Well, go on.
Kill the bloody
lot of us!
Stay out of
my fucking way...
or I'll kill you.
You've come home, Grace.
We're home.
Oh, my baby.
Am I that much
of a bastard, eh?
You're my mates.
You tell me.
It's not too late
if you want to go
to the Tangi.
We'll drive you.
Fuck off.
I'm not going to give them
the satisfaction.
I was never fucking
good enough,
not for their Beth.
I'll knock her
bloody head in.
Never mind, bro.
What's the key
to her, man?
You think I was
tough on the kid?
It wouldn't have been
just that, mate.
Bull, what do you think?
You think I was
tough on her?
Fucked if I know, bro.
I'll try and tell you
a story, eh, Gracie?
The story about a young girl
growing up
in this beautiful place.
She was given an honor.
She was made
Puhi of the Marae.
The special one.
Well, you see,
the girl fell in love,
as all young people do.
But you see,
the problem was...
the old people
wouldn't agree to the fella.
The girl, being headstrong,
went with him anyway.
Her father said
she'd be back...
that when everything
went to hell, she'd be back.
So the girl...
made a promise to herself
and said she wouldn't.
No matter what,
she wouldn't.
You see, Grace...
I did know
how to keep a promise.
I did.
I'm so sorry, Bub.
I'm so sorry.
I should have been
there for you, sis.
You were always
there for us.
Oh, son.
Hey, G.
Best friends...
forever.
Remember?
That's all I meant.
Honest.
But you were right.
I'm just a stupid kid
who lives in an old
wreck of a car.
She loved you, man.
She loved you.
What's the time?
What's the time,
Mr. Wolf?
What's the time?
Say, it's 1:00
Have you ever seen
so much piss?
That's because
they love you, man.
Yeah.
Yeah. Why not?
I'm a lovable chap.
Jake the Muss.
What's the time,
Mr. Wolf?
Ohh ohh
There's Mr. Daddy-Longlegs
Crawling onto the ceiling
The sun don't shine,
the sun don't shine
The sun don't shine...
Where the fuck are you?!
You bastard!
Fucking bastard.
Don't forget your hat,
eh, uncle?
Hey, uncle, did you
get all the ghosts?
I sure did.
Got the whole
lot of them.
Bring the kids with you.
We've got a lot of work
to do back home.
And here, too, auntie.
You sort out here first.
Be strong.
Good-bye, auntie.
You made me
real proud today, son.
Me, too, eh, Mum?
I made you proud today.
You sure did, Bub.
Well, I suppose I'd better
be taking off, then.
Take off?
Where to?
Probably back to my car.
I like it there.
Well, do you think
you could like it here,
with us?
Because we like having you.
Don't we, kids?
Well, whatever
you say, Mrs. H.
I mean, if you need me,
that'll be great.
I do need you.
Need you all.
Well, we'll say grace.
Grace!
Thank you for my family,
thank you for the food.
Amen.
Good look, bro.
Would you like one, bro?
No, thanks, man.
I wear mine on the inside.
you should take
the car back, son?
In the morning.
Your mates did you
proud today.
Mrs. H, could you read me
one of G's stories?
I can't.
That's why she reads to me.
I mean used to.
Yeah, the one
about the Taniwha.
OK.
What's wrong, Mum?
Toot, put the kids
in the car.
Thanks, bro.
Anyway, this fucking ape
comes over to me,
takes off his shades,
and says the classic line.
The classic line!
Wait for it.
Waiting,
waiting, waiting.
"What the fuck
you staring at, man?"
So I say to him, cool-ass,
"Well, not you, mate.
Your spunky missis."
Trouble is, she was
fucking uglier than him.
Then all hell
broke loose.
Old Jimmy, eh?
Hey, you can stay at
my place tonight, mate.
Yeah, fuck it.
Why not?
Beth! Bully, give
the lady a seat.
You fucking animal.
What the fuck?
Women and children, eh?
You fucking coward!
Please, control your
missis there, mate.
Who the fuck
do you think you are
coming in here
mouthing off at my mates?
Get the fucking hell
out of here
before I kick
your bloody head in.
That's always your
answer, eh, Jake?
Violence.
It's bad enough
that you did it here,
but you brought it
home with you
and I damn well let you.
What the fuck
are you on about now?
It was violence
that killed my Grace.
She didn't have
an ounce of violence
in her, Jake,
but we made damn sure
it was all around her.
She killed herself!
You bloody bastard!
It was your
bloody mate
who handed her the rope!
Hey, I don't have a clue
what you're on about.
You fucking child...
Shut up, Nig!
You animal.
You raped
a 13-year-old girl,
then sat here drinking
with her father
while the rest
of us buried her.
She's off
her fucking head, man.
Sneaking around my house
and laying
your dirty, filthy,
fucking hands on my baby!
My Grace!
Hey, you're not
on the fucking Marae now,
so don't come in here
accusing my mates of shit!
Hey, come on, man.
Look, no one's
thinking straight.
We're family. Right?
Beth. Sit down.
Have a drink.
I won't drink with
you fucking animals!
Read it.
Uncle Bully.
Uncle fucking Bully!
Let's go, son.
You dumb bastard, Bully!
Fuck you, Beth.
Where are you going?
I found something
better, Jake,
and I'm going to
make damn sure
my kids have it all.
From now on,
I make the decisions
for my family.
Fuck off, then!
You'll get nothing
from me.
You've got
nothing I want.
Our people
once were warriors,
but not like you, Jake.
They were a people
with mana, pride.
People with spirit.
If my spirit
can survive
living with you
for 18 years,
then I can survive
anything.
Maybe you
taught me that.
Oh, you are fucked, lady!
Really fucked!
You think I need you
and your fucking spirit?
Fuck off! Go on, go!
I don't want you, ever!
I'll knock
your fucking head off!
Fuck you! You'll be back.
Fuck this warrior shit.
You'll be back!
Fuck you, Beth!
Do you hear me, Beth?!
Fuck you!
Where are we going, Mum?
We're going home.
Oh, fuck all that
fucking warrior shit!
You'll be back!
You'll fucking see.
You'll need me!
You'll fucking want me!
You'll be back.
Fuck you, Beth!
Beth, fuck you! Beth!
