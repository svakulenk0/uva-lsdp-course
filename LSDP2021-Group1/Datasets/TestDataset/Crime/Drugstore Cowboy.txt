I was once a shameless,
full-time dope fiend.
Yeah, me, bob,
the sweet mother's son.
Me and my crew
robbed drugstores.
I had done them all...
up and down
the pacific northwest...
with the pharmacies
opened or closed.
Didn't matter
except for technique.
But don't get the idea
it was easy.
It's hard
being a dope fiend,
and it's even harder...
Running a crew.
Diane was my wife.
I loved her.
Man, and she loved dope.
So we made a good couple.
Whenever I got out of the joint,
I always ended up with Diane.
Rick was my sidekick...
my muscle.
He was no novice
to the life of crime.
His record showed a steady climb
from juvenile offender
to small-time thief.
He was gonna do
just fine.
Nadine was Rick痴 old lady...
a counter girl he picked up
during one of our jobs.
She was a piece of work.
She had no record,
just a smile that caught us all
a little off guard.
I was the undisputed
leader then.
I carried the whole
goddamn outfit on my back,
like it was
my own newborn son.
But I guess deep down,
I knew we could never win.
We played a game
you couldn't win...
To the utmost.
Good morning.
I like your hat.
Good morning.
- Do you have wintergreen gum?
- I'm sorry. I don't think
we carry that.
- Hey!
Hey! Come out here!
This lady's having a fit!
Hey!
Come on, she's spazzin'
all over the place!
Come on!
I think she might
swallow her tongue.
Look at that!
She's turning blue!
Excuse me.
- Are you too busy to take
the money for the cough syrup?
- Just a... just a minute.
There is...
just a minute, ma'am.
Wait a minute, man.
She's foaming here.
I need an ambulance.
A woman is having a...
an epileptic seizure.
- So how'd we do?
Aw, so-so.
Are you sure
you're okay?
...really good.
Hey! Let's go! Come on!
Hurry up!
I told you to walk,
not crawl.
You said walk,
and that's what we did.
Yeah, I said walk,
but I didn't mean
to go window-shopping.
goddamn it, bob.
Why do you got to fix
in the car?
Can't you wait till
we get home,
like everybody else?
Shut up
and watch your driving.
Christ!
Look at this traffic
up here. Shit.
We gotta get home.
Idiot! Move over!
After any kind of drug haul,
everyone in the crew indulged.
I'd laugh to myself as I
pictured blues or dilaudid...
in such great amounts
that the spoon would
literally be overflowing.
Upon entering my vein,
the drug would
start a warm itch
that would surge along...
until the brain consumed it
in a gentle explosion...
that began in the back
of the neck...
and rose rapidly
until I felt such pleasure,
that the whole world
sympathized and took on
a soft, lofty appeal.
Everything was grand then.
Your worst enemy,
he wasn't so bad.
The ants in the grass,
they were just,
you know,
doing their thing.
Everything took on the rosy hue
of unlimited success.
You could do no wrong.
And as long as it lasted,
life was beautiful.
Oh, goddamn it!
Screw you, buddy.
Move over.
Where'd you get
your goddamn license?
Shithead!
All right, now everybody
just act cool,
just like we just
got back from church.
Has anybody seen my lighter?
So, I was working
for this guy...
al, al Valdez...
and, um, he had
this great idea.
...and you, like,
just put shit on them
and water.
Only, he always
got loaded.
- Nadine?
- Give me the same as Rick,
I guess.
I don't think so.
Why not?
Nadine, you can't shoot...
no goddamn blue.
Give her half of one, bob.
That'll keep her in the crapper
all afternoon.
Goddamn it.
I was in there, just like you.
I ought to get the same
as everyone else,
even if I can't
shoot it all
right now.
That ain't the way
things work around here,
Nadine.
I mean,
you don't do shit.
It's me that's taking
the big risk.
What about Diane?
She didn't do
anything either.
Really?
That what you think?
Don't give her
a goddamn thing, bob.
Just kick her ass
out in the street
where we found her.
No. No.
Fair is fair.
You want your fourth,
you got it, Nadine.
But I ain't taking on
no apprentices and giving them
a full end of my thing.
You take it,
and get out.
Nadine, just take your
half a blue, shoot it
and go puke a while.
Shh.
All right, everybody.
Just act cool.
Nadine, pick up...
come on!
Pick up the drugs!
Rick, get your gun.
Get in the bedroom
and back me up.
It's David.
It's just David.
David, what do you want?
I just want to see you
for a minute, bob.
Come on, let me in.
You alone?
Hell yes, I知 alone.
Did you think I brought
my rat-faced granny along
to hold my hand?
David, you're an asshole.
What the hell, Pard.
Have you finally gone
completely crazy, man?
What the fuck
do you want?
What are you holding?
I ain't holding
diddly, small-fry.
I was just thinking
about going by
your place...
to see if you had
any speed.
Yeah, well,
I got some speed.
Really?
Cool.
Come on in.
Fucker.
What's up, Rick?
All right.
So you got speed?
What kind of speed you got?
I've got crystal methedrine.
This shit is good, man.
I've been up all night
on the stuff.
Here, man.
Try one on the house.
How much of this shit
you got on you right now?
I've got ten grams.
All right, let me
talk to Diane.
Why don't you sit back
and watch a little TV?
All right.
Baby?
This kid out here
says he's got speed.
What do you want
that goddamn speed for?
You know how ringy
it makes you?
I know, but listen.
What night is it tonight?
It's Saturday night, right?
Let's get some speed.
We'll fix up.
Then we'll go hit
that big, fat pharmacy.
You know the one.
Right next to
the unemployment office.
Babe, you know how
these things go.
It's like a crap game.
When you're hot,
you shoot everything.
You shoot the works.
When you're cold,
you lay off a bit.
Right now, I知 so hot,
I知 burning up all over.
All right, buster.
If you're so goddamn hot,
why don't you lay me down
on the bed right now,
and make love to me?
Aw, come on, Diane.
You know what I mean.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
So, you watch, uh,
I spy last night?
No. I watched
outer limits.
I'm hot to steal.
Shit, we could
do that anytime.
Come on.
Besides, we got company.
So, like, Dave,
do you think you could
get me a TV?
Yeah, I could
get you a TV.
Color.
Yeah, but what could you
do for me, man?
How about
some valium, man?
Look like
you could use it.
Ten milligrams,
sixty valiums.
That's cool.
Well, listen...
what?
Don't tell bob.
I won't tell bob.
Fuck that guy.
Hey, twerp.
We're gonna fix you up now.
Hey, man, you guys
got any blues?
Blues? Me?
Hell, no.
You know how hard
it is to get blues
these days, David.
How about some morphine?
I got some good old
morphine.
What'd you get, man?
Morphine sulfate?
You know, you're crazy, man,
'cause I can't even read
a stop sign...
when I知 on that crap,
my eyes get so far
out of focus.
Besides, I知 not trading
no uptown crank
for no downtown trash.
What can I say, David?
That's all I got.
That's all I can give.
That's bullshit, man.
You guys think I知 dumb.
I'm not as dumb
as you think I am.
Hey, David?
Too bad we couldn't
do business, pal.
All right, man.
Fuck! I'm sorry, okay?
I didn't mean
any of that.
It's all right.
So how many quarter grains
of that morphine are you
gonna give me for this?
I'll hit you with
nine quarters
per package.
And that just 'cause
I知 feeling good.
And because you're
a real stand-up dude,
I値l take all ten grams
from you.
Ten grams?
All right, that's nine apiece.
Nine times ten is, uh...
it's 75.
Yeah, 75.
It's 75.
That's 90, bob.
Yeah, bob, that's 90.
Hey, bob, how much
do you want for her?
How much of this
for her?
Huh?
How much
of this to you want
for the foxy female?
What do you think I am,
some kind of closet pimp?
I've never heard
of such a violation
of women's rights...
in all my life.
David, just
out of curiosity,
how many bags of speed
would you give me
for this girl?
I, I don't know...
you little twerp.
You touch me and I値l
knock your block off.
She's mean, man.
All right, all right.
Let's finish this deal.
Pick up your stuff,
David, and go.
We've got some things
to do.
All right. Sorry, Diane.
Here, bob.
Yeah.
All right, man.
All right, thanks.
See ya.
All right, you guys.
Have a good evening.
Next time you step
in the middle...
of one of my deals
to help me with my arithmetic,
I値l sell you to the first
one-eyed carnival freak
I can find...
for a pack
of chewing gum.
Look at me, babe.
I'm hysterical.
Sorry, bob.
Just try to remember.
Was it a down collar,
a scoop-neck, or what?
It was a blouse.
I really don't
remember.
oh, please don't hesitate
Diane, have you gone
crazy or something?
Put a little love
in your heart
and the world
Diane,
what the fuck
are you doing?
Will be a better place
what, are you on glue
or something?
Diane, look.
Will be a better place
we ought to be
out working, man.
I know this hospital
up on the coast.
I know it's a virgin.
I know it is.
This place has got
security zero.
I bet they
got coke, man.
All those hospitals,
they always hold
big-time coke.
You're crazy, bob.
Man, we just pulled off
the best score
we make in months,
and off you trot
looking for more.
You don't know
when to take a break.
Come on, bob.
You know me.
I can't stand
to go on forever like this.
Come on.
Just take me in the bedroom,
and just hold me for a while.
What do you want me
to hold you for?
Look, Diane.
We ought to be
out cracking.
I thought you loved me.
Why don't we
just, uh...
you won't fuck me,
and I always have to drive.
Why don't we just...
head up to that hospital
right now.
See if we can't make it
up there before it gets
daylight out.
I mean, babe...
you're just gonna flip out
when you see this one, man.
I mean...
I can just see all those
colored bottles
of pills...
that hospital's
holding for me
right now.
Up against the wall.
Come on,
up against the wall.
Don't give me any shit, man.
Check the other room.
Check the other room.
All right, you two,
turn around.
You know, I just
said the other day,
"it looks like Bobby Hughes...
finally slowed down a little,"
and bang, you knock off
another pharmacy.
- Bullshit, man.
- You gotta expect me
to drop by.
I didn't hit
no drugstore in years.
Bullshit!
Look, man.
You're not gonna
find nothing.
I'm calling my lawyer.
I'm sure he can straighten
this whole thing out.
Look at me.
Do I look like
I知 using?
You piece of shit.
That's real nice, bob.
Looks like you're hooked
to the gills.
You got a warrant?
Yeah, I got a warrant.
I got it pasted on the end
of one of these slugs.
You give me any more shit,
and I値l give you a good,
close look at one of them.
Whoa, heavy, man.
You guys been reading
too much Mickey spillane
or something?
You don't seem
to understand, bobby.
Hey, not those clubs.
Those are my ben hogans,
man.
Why you gotta mess
with the clubs?
So what are you
hitting these days?
- I got my handicap
down around eight.
- Eight? Bullshit.
Where do you play?
Mayfield.
I hit a 75 last time
I was out there.
I don't play those
public courses, greaseball.
Mayfield is for pussies,
and that's why you have
an eight handicap.
How am I supposed to play
if my clubs are all broke?
Come on, man.
Have a heart.
Break two more and then
leave the fuckin' clubs alone.
All right?
Thanks, man.
Diane, you haven't gone
and hid the drugs...
in some stupid place
like the frosted flakes
again, have you?
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about,
fuckwad.
Jesus. How old is she?
Is she over 18?
Twenty-two.
You're twenty-two
years old, right?
Twenty-two.
Twenty-two.
It's lucky for you.
Okay, kiddies,
here's how it's coming down.
You can just tell us
where the drugs are
and save yourself...
a whole lot of trouble.
Or you can sit there
with your mouths shut,
and we're gonna tear
this place apart,
board by board.
Now, how's it gonna be?
Man, I love cops.
If there were no
hot-shit cops
like gentry around,
the competition
would be so heavy...
there'd be nothing
left to steal.
Right?
All right.
You two take the car.
Get an apartment.
All right, bob.
Get something
over on the west side.
We haven't hit nothing
over there in weeks.
Should be
pretty cool by now.
Okay, bob, I will.
Don't mess it up.
I'm not gonna mess it up.
Just relax.
Diane and I are going
over to my mother's house
to get some new threads.
Something nice.
Oh, lord.
Hi, ma.
It's my dope fiend
thief of a son...
and his crazy little
nymphomaniac wife.
Hey, mom.
Please tell me what
I did to deserve this...
never knowing when there's
gonna be a knock on my door
telling me my baby's dead.
Green, with an overdose.
Shot by a mad pharmacist
or run over by a car...
while fleeing
from police pursuit.
Why me?
Ma, you don't happen
to have those clothes...
I left here last time
I was sent to the joint,
do you?
I threw all that
stuff away years ago.
I thought you were
never gonna get out.
How could you think that?
He is a thief
and a dope fiend,
and that is more important
to him than I am.
If you say so, ma.
He can go to prison.
He likes it there anyway.
Don't you, Robert?
Why do you hate
bob and I so, mom?
What have we ever done
to make you hate us so?
I don't hate you, Diane.
And I don't hate Robert
either.
And the good lord
knows that to be the truth.
I truly feel pity
for you both.
You are grown up now,
and yet you still act
as children who want to do
nothing but run and play.
You cannot run and play
all your life, Diane.
Is there anything else
of yours up there?
If there is,
just give it away.
I can always get more.
Oh, to be sure.
You'll just go
steal some more.
Yeah, 61, can you pick up
a fare, southeast locale?
Shut up!
So, this is our
new home.
Yeah, bob.
Why do they call it
Josephine?
I don't know.
The guy that rented it to me
is named dale.
Maybe Josephine
sounds better.
The last time I dropped acid
I decided to make
a self-portrait.
Groovy, isn't it?
Yeah. I can just see
all those bottles
of pills...
that hospital
is holding for me
right now.
...our stereo buy
of the month.
You can choose any of these
great systems for only...
hot dog.
Bob, speaking of dogs,
do you think
that Rick and I...
could get a little pup?
Just a little something
to hold and pet
when you guys are gone?
Make your first payment
no.
No. No fuckin' dogs.
Why, bob?
What do you got
against dogs?
Look, no fuckin' dogs,
and that's final!
Why don't you tell them
what happened to the last one
we had, bob?
Diane, if you want them
to know so much,
why don't you
tell them?
I don't want
to discuss it.
We had a dog once.
His name was panda.
Cutest little pup
you ever did see.
That little guy
used to follow bob
wherever he'd go.
Anyway, what happened was,
the police were after us
during a raid...
on a drugstore
in the city.
Little panda got out of the car
and ran away.
We looked everywhere for him,
but there just wasn't
any time.
The heat was on us
and we had to get
out of there.
We thought the little guy
got hit by a car
or something.
But no.
Police had him.
Somehow they knew
he was our dog.
They followed him
all the way home.
He led them to us.
They put us in jail.
And they put
little panda to sleep.
For a brighter coat,
whiter teeth
and a more even disposition,
there should only be
one choice:
Rich gravy, no cereal,
gravy...
Nadine, do you have any idea
what you've done to us...
by just mentioning dogs
in our home?
No. What'd I just do?
You've no idea?
No, I don't, bob.
What'd I do?
You just put a 30-day hex
on us, that's what you did.
Our luck just
flew out the window
for the next 30 days.
We got a calendar,
so we'll know when
this hex ends?
What month is it,
anyway?
Jesus, bob.
You never told us
anything about
not mentioning dogs.
The reason nobody
mentioned dogs, Rick,
is because just to have
mentioned a dog...
would have been a hex
in itself.
All right, well,
now that we're
on the subject,
are there
any other sacred things
we're not supposed to mention...
that are gonna
affect our future?
Yeah, as a matter
of fact, there are,
and we might as well
discuss them right now,
being as we're shut down
for the next 30 days.
Hats, okay?
Hats.
If I ever see a hat
on a bed in this house,
man, like, you'll never
see me again.
I'm gone.
That makes two of us.
- Why a hat?
- Because that's just
the way it is, sweetie.
And there's mirrors.
Never look at the back side
of a mirror.
Because when you do,
it'll affect your future,
because you're looking
at yourself backwards.
No. You're looking
at your inner self.
And you don't recognize it
because you've never
seen it before.
Anyway, you can freeze
into motion your future,
and that can be
either good or bad.
In any case,
we don't want
to take any chances.
But the most
important thing...
is the goddamn hat.
Goddamn hat on the bed
is the king of them all.
Hell, that's worth at least,
what, 15 years bad luck?
Or even death.
And I壇 rather have death,
'cause I couldn't face
no 15-year hex.
Relax, honey.
Let's go lay down
a while.
You've been on the go
for days now.
This 30-days thing
ain't gonna kill us.
Don't let it
get you down, bob.
Sometimes bad luck
can be good luck.
I mean, think of
all the times we had...
had a flat tire
or engine trouble
or something,
and we got to our score late,
thinking it was bad luck,
only to find out
for some reason
it was good luck.
Know what I mean?
Hell, I can't
figure it out.
I just know,
from years
of experience,
the things
to look for...
and the signs and...
you know what it's like?
It's like who's ever
managing such things...
is saying,
"go out there
and get it.
"It's there
for the taking, kid.
"Everything's free
this week.
I'll let you know
when your time's up."
Gotta see the signs.
Hell. All you gotta do
is look for the signs.
Shit.
Sorry, babe.
Sorry about that,
babe.
So what's going on?
Look, why don't we
just go in there?
We plant
some stuff on 'em.
We drag 'em on in.
It works
all the time.
I'll tell you why not.
'Cause I don't want to get
bob Hughes on no bullshit
possession beef.
That's all we're gonna
get him on unless we
catch him cold...
on his way home
from a score.
You know that.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Who is it, bob?
I don't know.
I thought you knew.
- Hi.
- Did I wake you up?
No, no, no.
We were awake.
No.
Weren't we, Rick?
Well, I don't know
what to think.
I saw this
sinister-looking man
with a ladder...
creeping around
outside my bedroom window.
I know that I wouldn't be
able to sleep a wink...
if I thought there was some
crazy sex maniac
running around.
Well, well, well.
Now, you just relax.
We'll go down there
and check it out
immediately.
Oh, thank you very much.
Yeah, we'll
check it out...
as soon
as we can.
Oh, good night.
Good night.
Good night.
Good night.
Good night.
Bye-bye.
What the hell...
is she doing up
at 2:00 in the morning?
It's gentry.
Yeah. I bet he followed us
when we moved.
That son of a bitch.
Yeah.
Well, I guess
we'll have to teach him
a little lesson, huh?
"The reason you can never
get bob Hughes...
"for possession
of narcotics is...
"that he has an arrangement
with the guy that lives
on the north side of him.
They have a line
running between
their houses..."
"...and bob signals the guy
when he wants the stuff.
"The next-door neighbor
puts it on a string,
"and bob pulls over
what he needs
and leaves the rest...
in the other house,
where you can
never find it."
bye, daddy.
bye-bye.
excuse me.
You got a second?
Yeah?
You live here,
right?
Yeah.
I live next door.
I know it's none
of my business...
What do you suppose
he has in that sack?
You think
it might be junk?
One thing I am positive of,
it's not his goddamn lunch.
About 2:00 this morning
I look out my window...
and sure enough,
there the guy is...
a big, ugly son of a bitch.
He's wearing a long,
dark raincoat
and he's standing...
on top of his ladder,
looking in your
upstairs windows.
He's got one hand
underneath his raincoat.
From where I was standing,
I gotta tell ya,
it looked kind of sick.
I'll shoot the son of a bitch.
I'll shoot the son of a bitch
right in the balls.
Now hang on a second,
mister.
You see the way
they talked to each other...
all the gestures
and such?
They've got
something going on.
They ain't just
casual acquaintances.
I can see that.
You know,
for a second there,
it looked like that big guy
was gonna jump on Hughes...
and stomp his guts out.
I would have liked
to seen that.
Okay, I know what
you guys are thinking.
"What's old bob
got me into this time?"
Let me tell you.
This is gonna be something.
You guys are gonna
love this.
Diane, where
you going?
I'm just gonna go
get my cigarettes, bob.
All right. Hurry up.
You're not gonna want
to miss this one.
Rick, where you going?
Just getting
a beer, bob.
All right, don't
come crying to me
when you miss out.
Okay, shh!
Here they come.
There's two of them.
Come here.
Come over here!
They're making their move.
One guy's climbing
up the ladder.
Oh, I hope he gets
pissed off at that man.
Okay.
The neighbor's coming
out of the house.
Holy shit.
He's got a shotgun!
Well, I値l be
a son of a bitch.
Show time!
Whoa!
Holy shit!
Bob, I want to talk to you
about what happened
last night.
Well, we told
the investigating officer
everything we knew.
There's nothing further
to add.
You little punk.
Halamer and trousinski...
know you set them up,
and I can honestly say...
they are anything
but happy about it.
Now, bob, I知 gonna make
a suggestion to you.
Why don't you take
a nice long drive somewhere
far away from here?
Wait a minute, gentry.
I won the goddamn war,
not you.
Who are you
to dictate the terms?
Why don't you go find
some small-town
police department...
where you can step
into sheriff.
Where all you gotta do
is worry about the usual
Saturday night drunks...
and kids fucking around.
So you think you
won the war, huh?
Pick him up.
You're just a junkie
that got one of
my officers shot.
And as soon as
he gets a hold of you,
everybody's gonna forget...
that you ever existed.
Let him go.
Little piece
of shit.
Let me give you
a hand up, bob.
Fuck you, gentry.
Don't forget
your clubs, pal.
Work on your handicap.
Now, don't think that gentry
was running us out of town,
because I could stand
the heat.
No, we were splitting
because things were
going all wrong.
Nadine's hex was
a little more powerful
than I had calculated.
It was time to change
the scenery,
which is what happened
when you went "crossroading."
Diane got the narcotics together
and sent them ahead by bus...
to depots across
the pacific northwest,
so we could rendezvous
with the drugs
as we needed them.
See, we couldn't afford
to be caught with a car
full of narcotics,
So we had a back-up plan
in the form of a hole...
punched through
the floorboard of our car.
When the flashing red lights
became a reality... bingo.
Down the hole
went the stash.
Something the matter,
officer?
Then we'd scramble
to the next rendezvous...
which was hopefully
within eight hours,
before the drugs wore off.
I'll tell you,
no construction stiff
working overtime...
takes more stress and strain
than we did...
just trying to stay high.
The reason we
rented this truck
is not necessarily...
because we needed
another vehicle.
But we can move easier
in a vehicle like this.
It's got the right
license plates on it,
so this way...
the average Joe
will just think we're
a couple farm boys...
and a prostitute,
hitting town
for a little joyride.
Hey!
I always wanted
to be a farmer, bob.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Did you guys
see that?
What?
The transom.
You guys didn't see
the open transom?
No.
What's a transom, bob?
It's all clear
in the back.
All right,
give me a lift,
then meet me
around back.
Okay.
Ready?
One, two, three.
Nadine, take these
and put it inside the truck.
Rick, step in here a minute.
I want you to look
at these two safes.
You see them over there?
Rick!
Let's go!
Shut up.
Christ.
You're finished, hophead.
You blew it.
Hey, babe.
You playing cards?
Who's winning?
What's the matter with her?
- Nothing.
Cocaine.
Holy shit.
What is it, bob?
What'd you find?
Powdered dilaudid,
that's what.
A whole, untouched,
one-eighth-ounce bottle
of powdered "d."
Whoo!
Hoo-hoo!
Should be another
partially filled one
in here somewhere.
See it?
Rick?
What, bob?
Do you have any idea
what this little bottle
is worth?
- No, bob. What's it worth?
- This here little bottle...
has got 840-some-odd
sixteenths,
and at ten dollars
a sixteenth,
that comes
to around $8,400...
of the best goddamn
pharmaceutical dope
money can buy.
What a find.
This here little bottle...
ought to last
the three of us a week.
I better take that.
Guess we must have
outrun that hex
we had on us, eh, bob?
Sure glad we started
crossroading.
bob?
Let's shoot it.
Be careful with this stuff.
It could kill you.
Diane, get a glass
of water.
Whoo!
Slow.
Show you how we're gonna
hide this stuff.
Right up here.
Yeah, we'll
take the stuff,
and we'll cross over
a couple of these units,
and stash it over
somebody else's room.
Whoa.
Wow.
Hey.
Hey.
Come on, buck up.
So you blew it.
Big deal.
Listen, we're gonna go out
for a couple hours but...
We'll be back
in a little bit.
What did that son of a bitch
say about me?
He didn't say anything
about you.
Yeah, but he's not gonna
take me along anymore,
is he?
Then one day you'll all
just drop me off somewhere,
and you'll never come back.
Nadine,
what are you
talking about?
Come on, honey,
you're with me.
I'm not gonna
leave you anywhere.
- He is a goddamn hog!
- Shut up!
Hog! Hog!
Hey, hey, hey.
Shut up. Shut up.
Come on, honey.
Hog!
Don't do that.
Please, Nadine?
Now, we got a good thing
going here.
Why do you want
to rock the boat?
I just can't stand
his superior ways.
And all that crap
about hexes...
you don't believe
that stuff, do you?
Look, Nadine,
I don't know, okay?
All we have to do
is not talk about pets
in their presence...
and not leave any hats
on any beds.
Now, what's hard
about that?
You know, I知 just going
to prove to all of you...
that a hat on a bed...
doesn't mean anything.
Hey, Rick, let's go.
Come on.
I really wish
you hadn't done that.
Say good-bye, Rick.
You just go on out
with them tonight,
and when you come back
I値l show all of you.
When I come back, I don't want
to see that hat on the bed,
all right, honey?
You know, Nadine,
there's just no talking
to you sometimes.
Fuck.
Dr. Clayton, please come
to nurses' station three.
Dr. Howard...
Hey, Rick.
Rick! Rick!
Don't be too aggressive, man.
We're just trying
to create a diversion, okay?
I don't want anybody
getting hurt.
Okay, bob.
Okay, babe,
you all set?
Yeah.
Okay.
Prepare to die.
Oh, no!
"Demerol"!
Shit.
Ow!
This just isn't
like him.
Bob is like a rabbit...
in and out
and no nonsense.
That goes for a lot more
than a hospital pharmacy.
Dr. Brown, line 237.
Dr. Wendell brown,
line 237, please.
he was asking for you.
Ok, tell him I'll be right there.
Mrs. Wong to admitting.
Mrs. Jane Wong to admitting.
Fuck! Fuck!
I don't think
he's gonna come.
Why don't we
go back?
Hmm?
They got him.
Bastards got him.
I know it.
I can feel it
in my heart.
Dirty bastards.
Nadine?
Oh, my god.
Honey?
I'm home.
You're not gonna believe
the shit that happened
to me tonight.
What's going on?
Who put the goddamn hat
on the bed?
She did, bob.
She didn't mean
anything by it.
She bit it.
Where'd she
get the stuff?
She couldn't
have done this
on no two sixteenths.
What's she been doing,
saving it up?
Who gave her this?
What is it?
Damn!
She must have picked it up
off the floor of the truck...
when we were collecting
these bottles.
Conniving little bitch.
Bob?
You can't say that
about her, bob.
She's dead.
You don't say
anything bad about her.
Rick.
She beat you.
Your own woman...
beat you out of your cut
on a score.
She got
what she deserves.
Listen, man,
not only that,
she threw a hex on us
we'll all be lucky
to outrun, huh?
She left us
with an o.d.'d stiff,
which is paramount
to a murder beef
in this state.
For Christ痴 sake,
get this goddamn hat
off the bed!
Cold.
Hell, it's like trying
to raise a couple of kids...
when you take on
a couple like that,
try and teach them
to steal.
Know what I mean,
Diane?
All these kids...
they're all TV babies.
They've been watching people
killing and fucking each other
on the boob tube for so long,
it's all they know.
Hell, they think it's legal.
They think it's
the right thing to do.
I know, hon.
I'm getting real tired.
Poor Nadine.
She was just
a goddamn kid.
Now what?
Hello.
Are you Mr. Hughes?
Yeah.
Are you planning
on checking out today?
No. Why?
Well, you see, sir,
we have prior commitments,
in the form of a reservation...
for your room today.
Today?
You mean,
check out today?
I'm afraid so.
You see, we're having
a sheriffs' convention
in town,
and all these rooms have
been reserved in advance
for them 90 days ago.
Do you think I could
go down to the office
and talk to you in ten minutes?
Give me ten minutes?
We're gonna know
some of those guys,
I'll bet.
I don't believe it.
I don't fuckin'
believe it.
A sheriffs' convention,
no less.
Why couldn't it have been
a tupperware convention?
Better yet,
an undertakers'.
Excuse me.
Hello?
Anything?
I'm sorry, Mr. Hughes.
You should have let us know
you intended on staying
this long.
Look, I致e got a colleague
in that room,
and he's sick
with the mumps.
I'm afraid to move him.
I mean, what if they
should spread?
The doc said
all we need is another day.
He can travel another day.
Oh, come on.
Come on.
This is it, huh?
Yeah.
Nice place, really.
Let's go get
a cup of coffee.
Good.
Guilty! Guilty!
Lock him up. He did it.
Lock him up!
Guilty! Guilty!
Guilty! Guilty! Guilty!
Guilty! Guilty!
It's gonna be
one heck of a time...
gettin' her out of
that crawl space.
Don't know if I知 ever gonna
get my nails done now.
Nadine really got to you,
didn't she, bob?
Yeah, well,
I値l tell you what's wrong.
I'm afraid some big, fat cop's
gonna come rumbling through
this door any minute...
and say,
"get out of this room.
This is my room."
Diane.
Yeah?
I love you.
I love you too.
Hey, Diane.
Hmm?
We have that blue
garment bag...
the big one.
Diane?
Don't worry, bob.
We'll make it.
Yeah.
We always do,
don't we?
Oh, j.d.!
You jump like an animal.
Honey? Let's go, dear.
We're gonna miss our flight.
Hi.
Boy, you almost
scared me to death.
Wow.
What a busy day.
What do you say
we go up to the attic,
divide the stuff up with Rick,
give him the big end,
don't count him short?
What's going on, bob?
What are you
thinking about?
Nothing.
I don't know.
I'm thinking about, uh,
headin' back home,
gettin' in the 21-day
methadone program,
cleanin' up my hands.
Are you kidding?
No, I知 not.
Diane,
I can't do it anymore.
Well, I知 not goin'
on no withdrawal program.
So what's gonna happen
to me?
Why don't you come with me?
No thanks, buster.
Not a fucking word do you
mention about all this.
Right out of the clear,
blue sky you say you're
gonna clean up your hand.
And you know I can't.
Look, Diane,
do what you want.
Take whatever we got.
I only need enough
to get me home.
Get the shovel.
I'll take care of her.
Go back to the truck.
Go.
For all
we
know
this may only be a dream
we come
and go
like the ripples
on a stream
So love me
- tonight
Tomorrow was made
You're a liar!
For some
Daddy, bring the car!
Tomorrow may
never
come
For all we know
Have you ever been on, um,
a maintenance or
a withdrawal program before?
Nah. Nah.
I see.
How long have you been
on drugs altogether?
All my life.
Then this isn't your
first time withdrawing.
No. It's my first time
withdrawing on methadone.
How old are you now?
Twenty-six.
Are you married?
Uh, yeah.
Where is your wife?
I don't know.
Do you have children?
No.
Um,
do you have a job?
No.
Do you have
a social security number?
No.
Have you ever been convicted
of a felony?
Yeah, a few times.
What were they?
What felonies
were you convicted of?
What do you want?
You want my whole life story?
Look, lady, I'm a junkie.
I like drugs.
I like the whole lifestyle,
but it just didn't pay off.
You know, you don't see
my kind of people.
'Cause my kind of people,
they don't...
they don't come down here
and beg dope.
They go out and get it,
and if they miss,
they go to jail.
And they kick alone
with nothing,
in some...
in some holding tank.
I'm sorry, bob.
I don't mean to hassle you.
All this is required.
I'm sorry if you think
it's unnecessary.
Have you ever considered
becoming a counselor...
and helping other addicts
with their problems?
Nah.
Why not?
Well, to begin with,
nobody,
and I mean, nobody...
can talk a junkie
out of usin'.
You can talk to 'em for years,
but sooner or later, they're
gonna get a hold of somethin'.
Maybe it's not dope.
Maybe it's booze.
Maybe it's glue.
Maybe it's gasoline.
Maybe it's a gunshot
in the head.
But somethin'...
somethin' to relieve
the pressures of
their everyday life,
like havin' to tie
their shoes.
Hawn.
You've got
some mail here.
Yeah, bless you.
Aw, you're welcome.
Father Murphy.
Hey, tom.
Well, well.
Bad bobby Hughes.
Imagine seeing you here
after all these years.
Yeah.
You live here too?
I have nowhere else to go.
There is no demand
in the priesthood...
for elderly drug addicts.
An indiscretion in 1970...
you were inside, I believe...
resulted in my descent
to this sorry state.
As a matter of fact,
I知 feeling a bit sick
right now.
Are you holding?
Nope.
They got me on, uh,
this 21-day thing.
Methadone.
Yeah.
What about yourself?
Oh, sure,
I知 on the program,
but sometimes I get
a little bit ahead
of my schedule.
You understand?
And sometimes I think
some junkie nurse...
may be stepping
on my medication,
but I can't be sure.
How about it?
You wanna score?
Nah.
But I値l keep you company.
This here is an artwork.
A work of art.
So is that.
More artwork.
Dig the pole
on that tree there.
Yeah,
that reminds me.
Yeah.
I used to know
an old croaker.
I think it was on that street.
Maybe it was the next street
over.
Yeah?
And he'd write like a major.
Tom knew his way around
the old neighborhoods.
I'd known tom since I was
an altar boy.
Benevolent father Murphy,
the most notorious dope fiend
on the coast.
When he was holdin',
he'd always share
with those who weren't.
He was very kind.
Tom was king then.
He had it all.
His ass was covered
in this life and the next.
I bet he shot a million bucks
in his arm.
Okay. Now, this is what you
call a radial-arm drill press.
You get the drill you want,
putting it in the holder.
Make sure you've got
a good grip on it.
That brings your drill
down to your work.
Position it over the hole.
That's your clutch.
This is your power feed.
This is the clutch that engages
the power feed.
You put that in,
and just let it drill.
Dorris?
What do you want?
You seen Jim?
I've seen him nowhere!
If you're gonna go to work
loaded, it's gonna show.
Being loaded is like
being drunk, you know.
You take a drink
in the morning, you gotta
get high in the morning.
Your boss is gonna see it,
and you'll get fired.
Then you're not makin'
that big money.
Then you're gonna
have to do somethin' else.
You're gonna have
to rob, steal, sell.
Um, somewhere in that
robbing and stealing,
you might end up killing
your best buddy over a fix.
You're just gonna
go down the tubes.
There's no other way around it.
The more you use,
the longer you use,
the further down you go.
You gotta find
your own bottom.
Yeah.
Not me. I'm tired of it.
I'm tired of being broke.
I'm tired of being sick.
Yeah. Mm-hmm.
Catching up
on your reading?
You didn't stay gone long,
bob.
What happened?
Nothin' happened.
I hear you're on
a methadone program now.
You don't think that's gonna
keep trousinski from
jumpin' your ass, do ya?
To tell you the truth,
I haven't given it
much thought.
You know, for once
I知 not here to hassle you.
You know, trousinski
lost his gold badge over
that little incident.
He's workin' traffic
out at the north end.
He's made so many
goddamn threats, he's almost
gonna have to hurt you.
And I don't wanna
see that happen.
Man, look, what can I say?
I gotta job, you know?
What happened out there
in the sticks, bob?
Where's Diane?
Well, you know how
whimsical women are.
She found some other dude
to chase after,
and off she went,
chasin' after him.
I find that a little hard
to believe.
You and Diane have been
runnin' around together
since you were little kids.
You know,
I hope you make out
on that job of yours.
I sincerely hope
that you straighten up
a little bit.
Take care of yourself,
bob.
You stupid son of a bitch!
Shut up!
My old lady's still out there
right now.
Yeah, forget about her.
Yeah.
I can't do nothin' with her.
I tried. I told her to come.
She didn't want to come.
She's doin' her own thing.
Yeah, shit.
What I was doin', I was
goin' right to the source.
Right to the source.
Where do they make drugs?
In a drugstore.
Yeah, if you want some money,
you go to the bank, huh?
Shit.
"Yeah, honey, I gotta
stop by the bank
and then the drugstore.
I'll be home after a while."
Man, what are
you cryin' for?
You're the one who wants
to do the drugs.
You gotta pay for 'em, man.
Where's my fuckin' money,
bitch?
Punk. Where the fuck
is my money?
Come on.
This is the third time
I had to ask you.
Come on.
What are you gonna say?
Say something.
You want me to hit you?
Say somethin'.
Hey, Dave. Hey, David!
What do you think
you're doin', man? Huh?
What do you think
you're doin'?
This kid's cryin', man.
So? It's business, man.
What do you care?
Why don't you get out of here,
and mind your own business?
Because it bugs me.
Hey, take a walk.
Hey, man.
Come on. Goddamn!
Why don't you grow up,
man? Huh?
I am grown-up.
Asshole! Fuck!
Why didn't you
do somethin', man?
What's up with you?
I thought you... fuck.
Man, I知 not buying you
no lunch.
You know, tom,
you told me a lot
of the old-time stories...
about how you used to...
stick your arm in between
the bars of the cell.
The guard would come by,
and he'd fire you up
a shot of morphine.
Well, they never did that
for me.
Well, they don't do that
for anyone anymore.
Narcotics have been...
systematically scapegoated...
and demonized.
The idea that anyone can
use drugs and escape
a horrible fate...
is anathema
to these idiots.
I predict,
in the near future,
right-wingers will use
drug hysteria...
as a pretext...
to set up an international
police apparatus.
But I知 an old man,
and I may not live...
to see a final solution
of the drug problem.
You know what, tom?
You might have missed
your calling.
You should have been
a philosopher.
Well, bob, in another life,
perhaps.
In another life.
Who is it?
Who is it?
Hey.
Jesus! What kind
of a dump is this?
And where is the female?
You might as well trot her out.
You don't ever change,
do you, Diane?
Goddamn right I don't.
Why should I?
Hey, I was just commenting
on how good you look. Yeah.
Yeah? I'll bet.
How about a cup of tea?
Yeah.
Yeah?
So, how's that methadone
thing workin' out?
So-so. Hey, I got a job.
Did I tell you that?
No shit.
Where are you workin'?
Oh, just a machine shop
over on western.
Yeah?
Yeah.
What do you do there?
I, uh, drill holes.
"Drill holes"?
Yeah. I drill...
I drill these holes
that, uh,
bolts fit into.
Oh, yeah?
How do you like it?
Well, I値l tell you the truth.
It's kind of a drag,
but it pays the rent.
Then you're really serious.
You're gonna go on
with this thing.
Yeah.
Hey, Diane, why don't you
take your coat off
and stay a while, huh?
I can't, bob.
I got people waitin' for me
out in the car.
I just came up to see
how you was doin'.
Here.
That's from Rick
and the rest of us.
Kind of thought you might need
a taste once in a while.
What happened?
What made you turn around
that day?
Was it me?
Did I do somethin' wrong?
No, baby,
it wasn't you.
It was Nadine痴 death
and the hex she threw on us
with that hat.
And then I panicked
when I looked out
into that parking lot...
and I saw
all those cop cars.
Hell,
I knew I was dead.
So, I started coppin' deuces.
I prayed like I never
prayed before.
I said, "god, sun, devil,
whoever you are up there,
please have pity on me.
"Please let me get
this poor girl's body...
"out of this hotel room
and into the ground,
"so I don't have to spend
the rest of my life in prison.
"And god,
if you'll do that for me,
"I'll show you my appreciation
by goin' home,
"gettin' on
the methadone program,
gettin' a job
and livin' a virtuous life."
Well, I got out...
and I promised,
so here I am.
Are you gonna
stick with it forever?
Well...
you know, Diane,
for all the boredom
the street-life brings,
it's not that bad.
I mean, even this crummy
little room ain't so bad.
I actually wake up
some mornings,
and I feel like...
somethin' good's
gonna happen today,
you know?
I'm a regular guy.
I got my regular job.
I got my regular room.
Now I got you.
Man, you're crazy, bob.
You're really crazy.
Diane, why don't you
go downstairs,
and tell your friends
that you're gonna
spend the night?
Come back,
bed down with me
for a little while.
I'd like to, bob,
but I got another
old man now.
I'm... I'm
Rick痴 old lady now.
Ain't that a gas?
I work for Rick.
There we were,
teaching that brat to steal,
and now I知 on his crew.
Things sure can get
screwed around,
can't they?
Yeah.
And bob, you know me.
I might have been
a lot of things,
but I never was a tramp.
Bob, l gotta go.
Hey, Diane?
It's really good
to see ya.
I mean,
you look really good.
I wish I could
win ya back.
Hand it to me now!
Who is it?
Tom, it's bob.
Open the door.
Hey.
Bob, come in.
Hey, what's this?
It's a gift.
I won't be needing it.
Yeah?
Yeah, I got
my new program down, so...
a gift. Wow.
Knock yourself out.
Mmm, let's just see
what's in there.
Mmm. Mmm.
God bless you, my son.
May you go to heaven.
Now... oh, yeah.
This...
this is for squares.
Never touch this stuff.
But this...
one hundred sixteenths
of dilaudid.
This should earn you
an indulgence.
Where's it at, bob?
- Hey, look, what do you want?
- We want your dope, man.
Where's the dope?
You think if I had dope,
I'd be sittin' in this
flea trap, huh?
I'm on a methadone program.
You come around me for dope?
That's a laugh.
Shut up.
All right, fucker man.
You want it the hard way?
We're just the guys who are
gonna give it to you.
Is that you, David?
Huh?
You listen to me,
you little punk.
I'm goin' straight, man!
I ain't fuckin' bullshittin'!
I'm goin' straight, man!
You ought to try it some time.
It's good for the soul.
Fuckin' liar!
Where is it, bob!
We know this is all
a scam you're playin'.
So where is it?
Where the fuck is it?
There's nothing
more life affirming...
than getting the shit
kicked out of ya.
I knew it in my heart.
You can buck the system,
but you can't buck
the dark forces that lie...
hidden beneath the surface...
the ones some people call
"superstitions"...
howling banshees,
black cats,
hats on beds,
dogs and the evil eye.
So, I relaxed and gave in
to the notion...
that for the very first time
in my life, I knew exactly
what was going to happen next.
Fuck!
Now I知 gonna kill
the son of a bitch!
I bet you the next bastard
we catch will tell us
where it's at.
- So he's tough.
-
They ain't all tough.
I say kill him.
Do you hear me, bob?
Come on. Let's go.
Hey, great idea!
Is that really necessary?
No, but it was fun.
So get over it.
Come on.
But a party's a party.
what's goin' on?
Come on.
No, sir,
you can't stand here.
Is he gonna make it?
Let me get him for a second.
Stand back.
Just stay back, please.
Bob, can you hear me?
Bob,
who did this to ya?
Was it trousinski?
All right, bob. Tell me.
Who shot ya?
The hat.
"The hat"?
Bob, did you say,
"the hat"?
Tell Diane...
to look out for the hat.
Tell her.
Okay.
Okay?
Okay. So the hat shot you,
right, bob?
No.
The TV baby shot me.
The TV baby shot you,
but the hat was with him.
Bob, who's the hat?
You gotta tell me
who the hat is,
so I can tell Diane.
Uh...
never mind.
I'll tell her myself.
We gotta get him
outta here.
It's this fucking life.
You never know
what's gonna happen next.
Roger, 10-4.
Maybe that's why
Nadine spiked herself
with the easy way out.
And that's why Diane
keeps on goin' like she does.
See, most people,
they don't know how
they're gonna feel
from one minute to the next,
but a dope fiend
has a pretty good idea.
All you gotta do
is look at the labels
on the little bottles.
You gotta know how
to read the signs.
That's what the hat
on the bed was...
which is why I知 not scared.
I paid my debt to the hat.
The irony
was fucking brilliant.
The chicken-shit cops
were giving me an escort to
the fattest pharmacy in town.
I was still alive.
I hope
they can keep me alive.
