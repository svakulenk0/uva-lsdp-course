Shit!
Come on.
Hey, Marvin,
what are you doin'?
He's mine, Jack. Get lost.
- Fuck you.
He's mine. Eddie assigned him to me.
What are you doing?
Straighten it out with Eddie.
I'll collect the money.
I almost got killed. He shot at me.
- Back off!
I'm taking him.
This guy's worth 1.200.
What the hell we fightin' for?
We're friends.
Nothing personal, but fuck off.
Take it easy. Jesus!
Marvin, watch out!
What the fuck's goin' on?
You guys ain't cops.
No, we're ballet dancers.
Your mother teach you how to react
to strangers?
Not shoot at 'em?
Hey, Marvin, thanks for the car.
You sleep, and I'll bring it back
a little later.
Got a delivery for you, Gooch.
Good. The soda machine's been out
for a week and a half.
Check that for me.
What've we got here?
All right.
Give you any trouble?
Did you give me any trouble?
Fuck you, man!
- He didn't give me trouble.
If you want your arms, walk.
- Fuck you, too!
Slap it.
Mascone's Bail Bonds.
No, it's cash only.
No checks, no cards.
I'm sorry, ma'am.
That's the policy.
I wish I could help you out.
Sorry.
Just dropped off Bouchet.
Is Eddie in?
So you finally
caught someone, Jack.
Jerry, is he in?
That's terrific.
Been tryin' to reach you.
What do you got for me?
You were tryin' to reach me?
Bouchet.
Bouchet. Good score, Jack.
Nine-hundred, right?
No, it's 1.200.
- No, nine.
That's 1.200. Come on.
No. Yeah, you're right.
My stomach's killin' me.
I'm goin' to Chin Loo's for breakfast.
I wanna talk to you.
- About what?
I'll talk to you over there.
- Could I have my money first?
Of course.
You think I'm gonna try to stiff you?
You? Never! He would never
try and stiff me.
Do I detect sarcasm?
- Never.
Where have I inherited
this reputation?
I have never done business
with anybody...
and Jerry is my witness,
that I have ever, ever, ever
Has that phone ever rang
with a complaint about me?
Never. So let's go.
I'll buy you some breakfast.
I don't eat breakfast.
- Then have an early lunch. Let's go.
You ever hear of Jonathan Mardukas?
The Duke. Yeah, I know who he is.
- What do you know?
He's that accountant that embezzled
millions from some Vegas wise guy.
He gave it to charity.
- Very good.
Only thing is, it wasn't a couple
of million. It was $15 million.
It wasn't some Vegas wise guy.
It was Jimmy Serrano.
I know.
I can read the papers.
Look, I don't wanna bring up
the past, but...
isn't it Serrano who ran you out of
Chicago when he was runnin' things then?
He didn't run me out.
- You gave up bein' a cop to do this?
All right, what's the point?
- The point, Jack?
I bailed out the accountant.
I didn't know who he was at the time.
Had I known, there was no way
I would've put up the bond.
It's only time before Serrano
vanishes this guy from the planet...
and I'm out $450.000.
You're out $450.000 on this guy?
No, because I got you. You're the best.
You'll find him and bring him back.
Yeah, right.
How do you know he's still alive?
Because this guy is crazy.
He sends postcards to Serrano...
tellin' him what a great time
he's havin' with his money.
How much time do you got left?
- Friday midnight I default.
I eat the $450.000.
- This Friday?
That's five days. Forget it.
You go find him. Give me my money.
Listen to me.
I'll give you $50 grand.
$50 grand? I gotta chase you down
for $1.200. Forget it.
No, Jack, please...
- Forget about it. What else you got?
This is it. If you don't find this guy,
I'm outta business.
Eddie, I'll do it for $100.000.
$100.000!
Are you outta your mind?
This is an easy gig.
It's a midnight run, for Chris sakes!
Maybe you haven't noticed,
but I'm tired of gettin' shot at.
I'm tired of this miserable fuckin'
business, every lowlife that I run into.
If you're gonna pay me,
you gotta pay me what's right.
You want me for this job,
give me what's right.
The guy is an accountant.
He's not gonna shoot you.
All you have to do is find him...
put him in a bag, hit him
with a rubber hose, bring him home.
That's easy for you to say.
Listen to me.
It's $100.000. No more, no less.
And I want a contract.
Contract?
- Right, and I want it in writing.
$100.000 and I'll have the Duke here
for you by Friday night.
Now, can I have my $1.200, please?
You do worse than any crook
I ever put a bond up for.
Stanley? Stan!
Hey, Big Dog. How are you?
What are you doin' here?
I need a favor.
I need to see the booking slip
of Jonathan Mardukas.
M-A-R-D-U-K-A-S.
Here you go.
Yes, sir.
What's that?
The number he called
right after he was arrested.
Looks like I'm goin' to New York.
Are you Jack Walsh?
Excuse me.
- Are you Jack Walsh?
Do I know you?
- Alonzo Mosely, FBl.
That's a nice badge.
How can I get one of those?
I wanna talk.
Call my social secretary.
- Very funny.
I wanna talk to you.
- Take your hands off me!
Geez! Take it easy!
It's a $10 fine for jaywalking in L.A.
- Oh, shut up!
I want to know if you're working on
anything to do with Jonathan Mardukas?
Never heard of him.
- I believe you have heard of him.
We've been working on this
Jimmy Serrano thing for six years.
Mardukas is my shot.
I'm gonna bring him in
to federal court.
I don't want any third-rate rent-a-thug
who couldn't cut it as a Chicago cop...
bringing him to L.A.
on some bullshit local charge.
Do I make myself understood?
Can I ask you something?
These sunglasses, they're really nice.
Are they government issue...
or do all you guys
go get 'em at the same store?
Do I make myself understood?
- Can't you take a joke?
Get him outta here.
Let's talk some more.
- Get the fuck outta here.
If I hear anything,
I'll let you know.
Have a nice day.
Thank you.
Could I have my sunglasses back?
- Here's your sunglasses.
Thanks. Thanks for this too.
"Alonzo Mosely".
Alonzo.
How's that?
Looks fine to me.
Harold Longman, please.
Harry? Jack Walsh.
How ya doin'?
You got that address check
on that phone number for me?
Okay. Thanks a lot, Harry.
Say hello to Julie for me.
Okay, bye.
Thank you.
You Jack Walsh?
Who wants to know?
- Answer "yes".
We'd like to have a word with you.
- Yeah? What about?
It involves big cash, lotta prizes.
I'll make it short. The people
I work for are interested in your visit.
Yeah? Who do you work for?
- Your old friend from the Chicago days.
You're here for the Duke. You think he's
in New York, and we think you're right.
That's a nice jacket.
What is it, goat skin?
Come on, Joey, please, will ya?
Never mind him.
I hear you didn't cooperate
with my boss a few years back.
Is that what you heard?
- Yeah, but I got a news flash.
He'd pay a lot more for the Duke
than that bail bondsman in L.A.
How much more?
- How about a one with six zeroes?
Are you gonna propose?
- Propose?
'Cause if you're not,
quit starin' at me, okay?
You're staring at me.
- Joey, back off, will you, please?
Mr. Walsh, your car's located
in space number 206.
You can catch our shuttle bus
just through these doors.
Thank you.
- Here's my number, Jack.
Ask for Tony Darvo. That's me. They'll
put you through to wherever I am.
And be good to yourself
this time, okay?
Tell Jimmy I said hello.
Hello?
- Hello? Mrs. Nelson?
Alonzo Mosely,
Federal Bureau of Investigation.
How are you this afternoon?
- I'm fine.
Let me get to the point, if I may.
An agent in our Los Angeles office
discovered a detail...
that was somehow overlooked.
When Jonathan Mardukas was arrested,
you were the first person he called.
Is that correct, Mrs. Nelson?
Are you there, Mrs. Nelson?
- Yes.
This is a matter
of great concern to us.
If it's not too much trouble...
could you come down tomorrow morning
to 26 Federal Plaza?
I suppose so.
About 9:00 a.m.?
- Yes.
Just ask for Agent Alonzo Mosely.
Thanks for your cooperation.
Have a nice day.
Hello?
- Dana? It's Helen.
The FBl just called.
They want to speak to me about Jonathan.
Oh, my God! Helen.
- Helen, what's going on?
Jonathan, the FBl called. They know
we spoke the night you were arrested.
Hang up the phone, Helen,
right now.
Ah, sweet music.
Did you check this one?
What is it, Jon?
- I don't know.
Alonzo Mosely, FBl!
You're under arrest!
Get this fuckin' dog out of here!
Get this dog out of here, ma'am.
Not you. You stay there. Get the dog.
- Do it.
Heidi, come on, girl.
That's a good girl.
Don't move or I'll shoot you
through the glass.
Get over here.
Put your hands up against the wall.
Spread your feet.
Relax, there won't be a problem.
Put your left hand
behind your head.
That's it.
You're taking me to the airport,
aren't you?
You don't look like
an FBl agent to me.
Yeah? Well, you don't look
like a duke to me.
If you're an FBl agent, why not
just take me to the FBl office?
If you don't be quiet, this is going
to be the worst trip of your life.
You work for Jimmy Serrano, don't you?
- I don't work for that piece of shit.
Your bail bondsmen hired me to bring
you to L.A., and that's what I'm doin'.
I got money.
- I'm sure you do.
I'll give you whatever you want.
- Start by shutting up.
I know you two minutes,
and already I don't like you.
That's too bad.
I really like you.
I can't cuff you on a commercial flight,
and I've gotta check my gun in luggage.
But you fuck with me once,
and I'm gonna break your neck.
I can't fly.
- What?
You heard me. I can't fly.
- You'll have to do better than that.
It's the truth. I can't fly.
I suffer from aviophobia.
What does that mean?
- It means I can't fly.
I also suffer from acrophobia
and claustrophobia.
If you don't cooperate, you're
gonna suffer from "fistophobia".
Mascone's Bail Bonds.
- Jerry, put Eddie on the phone.
What's the progress?
I got him.
- You got who?
The Duke. He's standin' right here.
- You got him? Already?
Sure do. Wanna say hello? Say hello
to your bailbondsman, Eddie Mascone
Hello.
Jonathan Mardukas in the flesh.
- Jack, I love ya!
How did this happen?
Where'd you find him?
I found him in New York.
We're at the airport.
Holy Christ! This is wonderful!
This is wonderful news!
I'll be in your office by midnight
tonight, and I'm tellin' you.
I don't wanna hear any bullshit.
I want the money tonight.
So empty out one of
your Swiss bank accounts.
You don't have to worry about nothin'.
This is the best money I ever spent.
See you in a few hours.
- I'll see ya later. 'Night.
What's that all about?
- Jerry Walsh got the Duke!
Walsh got the Duke?
- He got him! He got the Duke!
No kiddin'? This calls for
a celebration. I'll get some donuts.
How do you think Walsh
found him so fast?
Tony, this is Jerry.
- Jerry who?
Jerry Geisler. What are you doing?
- Eatin' dinner. What do you want?
I hate to bother you,
but I thought you'd like to know...
that Walsh found the Duke in New York.
They're flyin' in tonight.
They should arrive around midnight.
Don't forget me, babe.
- Yeah, kid, yeah.
Thanks. Good night.
Looks like your old friend
found the accountant.
They'll be flying into L.A.
around midnight.
Have them met at the airport.
You understand?
- Done.
Can I take your coat?
- No, that's fine. Thanks.
May I take your coat?
- No.
First class is nice.
I could make a habit out of this.
Good evening, gentlemen.
- Good evening to you.
Would you like a drink
before we take off?
Yes, we would like
one of your finest champagnes.
Certainly.
Let's see.
Look at this.
Only in America.
What a country. Huh?
Unbelievable.
I think I'm gonna have the steak.
How about you?
- I'm not hungry.
Why don't you get lobster? Then I can
get some surf and turf action goin'.
I got a problem.
I can't fly.
You're not takin' me seriously.
I'm takin' you very seriously.
- I can't be on this plane.
You think I haven't heard
your story before?
You think you're traveling with
a novice? Know what I'm talkin' about?
That's it. Settle in.
If you wanna get up and talk...
mingle with the rest of the passengers,
be my guest.
You ain't goin' nowhere. There's
a couple of nice-lookin' people here.
Better class of people.
Your class.
Probably all embezzlers, too.
Come fly with me
Come fly away
Just try and relax.
Look, I...
Just calm down.
Just relax and calm down.
Why are you gettin' so excited?
- It's not...
No! I can't!
No! No! No! I can't.
Just relax. Just relax.
What did I tell ya?
Don't pull that shit on me.
No! I'm tellin' you.
I can't do it.
Get over there.
- These things go down!
It's too big! It can't go up!
All right, everyone, just calm down.
What's the problem?
It's nothing, sir. Alonzo Mosely, FBl.
This man is in my custody.
I'm takin' him back to Los Angeles.
There won't be any more problems.
I don't wanna fly.
I can't fly.
You know you can't take a prisoner on
an airplane if he doesn't want to fly.
I do. I'm sorry.
I thought he was bluffing.
I suggest you find
some other mode of transportation.
What the fuck are you smilin' about?
- I love to travel by train.
Oh, yeah? What do you think
this is, a class trip?
Are you always this angry?
- Right now I'm in a great fuckin' mood.
When I'm cooped up on that for a while,
you won't be smilin'.
You'll be runnin'
for that fuckin' jail cell.
Still gonna make your schedule?
I'll make it,
with 14 hours to spare.
Oh, nice. It's a double.
There'll be a lot of room.
Glad you like it.
- Good. Very nice.
Thanks, 'cause it's starting
to cut into my wrists. Thank you.
It gets the skin after a while.
Get in there.
- What do you want? What?
Oh, come on. Come on.
No, you don't...
Why would you do that?
You enjoy yourself. This is my room,
and that's your room. Good night.
Hey, can I help you guys?
- Special Agent Mosely, FBl.
Are all you guys named Mosely?
- What the hell are you talking about?
You're here to pick up a prisoner.
- How did you know that?
He was afraid to fly,
so he got off the plane.
He left with an Agent Mosely.
Sir, that must mean Walsh
has your identification.
Is this moron number one?
Put moron number two on the phone.
Yeah, Jimmy.
He's right here. Hold on.
He's pissed.
You told me this guy
would be on the plane.
That's the information we got.
- "That's the information we got".
I'm gonna tell you something.
I want this guy taken out fast.
You and that other dummy start getting
more personally involved in your work...
or I'm gonna stab you through the heart
with a fuckin' pencil.
Do you understand me?
- You got it, Jimmy.
Tony, he ain't mad at me, is he?
Jack?
Jack, I think this is illegal.
I don't think you can keep
a person in a bathroom like this.
It's very claustrophobic in here...
It is? Well, I'll tell you what.
When we get to L.A....
you can tell the prison psychiatrist
all about it.
There's no air.
There's no ventilation in here.
I told you I was claustrophobic.
Come on.
What do you think I'm gonna do? Jump off
a train moving 90 miles an hour?
Jack?
Good. Thanks. Thanks.
Thanks a lot.
Sit down.
- Yeah, that's great.
Very kind of you.
It's much better.
Thank you. Good.
What are you doing?
What am I doin'? Arithmetic.
Arithmetic? Maybe I can help you.
I am an accountant.
I was thinkin', after I turn your ass in
and collect my money...
I'm gonna open up a coffee shop.
How much are you getting for me?
That's not any of your concern.
But I'll tell you just to tell you.
A hundred thousand.
- A hundred thousand?
Would you take a $100.000
to let me go?
Not by a long shot.
- Two-hundred thousand?
I never took a payoff in my life, and
I'm won't start with someone like you.
Why not?
- Because you're a fuckin' criminal.
You deserve to go where you're goin',
and I'm gonna take you there.
If I hear any more shit out of you,
I'm gonna bust your head...
put you back
in that fuckin' hole...
and I'm gonna stick your head in
the toilet bowl and make it stay there.
I have to tell you, a restaurant
is a very tricky investment.
More than half of them go under
within the first six months.
If I were your accountant,
I'd strongly advise you against it.
You would?
You're not my accountant.
No, if I were your accountant...
- I told you, I took you out here...
No, I'm just saying that
it's a very tricky business...
and if I were your accountant, I would
strongly advise you against it...
as an accountant.
You're not my accountant.
- I realize I'm not your accountant.
I'm saying,
if I were your accountant.
Jerry, how the hell could he miss
the goddamn plane?
He called from the airport!
All right. It's time to bring in Marvin.
Call him. He's in Pittsburgh.
Marvin Dorfler?
- Yeah, Dorfler.
Under "D" in the Rolodex for "jerk".
Can I at least
have some french fries?
I said no, pecker breath.
Now shut up.
Dorfler.
Marvin?
Sweetheart, am I glad I got you.
Boy, do I have a job for you!
- I'm listening.
First of all, I gotta apologize,
because we were trying to find you.
It's an important job, but I couldn't
find you, so I gave it to Walsh.
But now he's fucking it up, so...
- I don't know why you hire that guy.
I know. I apologize. You are the best
at what you do. You know that?
Do you know Jonathan Mardukas?
No.
- Jonathan Mardukas, the Duke?
I never heard of him.
- All right. That's not important.
What's important is that you find him
and that you bring him back, okay?
Last I heard, he had him in New York.
Now I don't know where they are.
If you find him, I'll give you
what I'm givin' Walsh.
What's that?
Twenty-five thousand.
But you gotta have him back by Friday
midnight, otherwise the deal is off..
Don't worry. For $25 grand,
I'll bring him in on a silver platter.
Bring him anyway you want,
but bring him, okay?
Bye.
Hey, scumbag.
- My name's Carmine, fucko.
Well, Carmine,
today's your lucky day.
Why is today my lucky day?
- Shut up!
Yeah. My name is Jack Walsh.
Excuse me.
John Wesley Walsh.
I think I lost my credit card.
Can you tell me
the last place I used it?
Yeah, 731-483-9521-13.
The Amtrak office,
Grand Central Station?
Yeah, yeah.
I remember that now.
Okay. Thanks very much.
Hey, maybe we oughta cancel
that card, huh?
Yeah. Thank you.
Familiar with the word
"arteriosclerosis"?
Cholesterol?
If you want, I'll outline
a complete balanced diet for you.
Mail it to me from "C" block.
Why would you eat that?
- Why? 'Cause it tastes good.
But it's not good for you.
- I'm aware of that.
Why would you do something
you know is not good for you?
Because I don't think about it.
- That's living in denial.
Living in denial?
- Yeah.
I'm aware of that.
- So you're aware of all your behavior.
Yet you do things not good for you.
Don't you think that sounds foolish?
No. Stealing $15 million
from Jimmy Serrano sounds foolish.
I didn't think I'd get caught.
- Now, that's livin' in denial.
I'm aware of that.
- So you're aware of your behavior.
Yet you continue to do things
that aren't good for you.
Sounds foolish to me. Don't you think?
- It was foolish.
But taking $15 million in mob money...
and giving it to charity
was good for a lot of people.
So you pissed off a mafiioso killer
just to be loved by fuckin' strangers.
That makes a lot of sense.
- Don't you want to be loved?
Lots of people love me.
- Really?
Who?
I got an ex-wife,
and a daughter in Chicago.
How do they put up
with all your sarcasm?
Beautifully. I haven't seen
either of them in nine years.
Think we should go see them?
- No, I don't think we should see them.
Thanks for the interest, though.
- The job must have been tough on 'em.
I didn't do this then.
- What did you do?
I was a cop.
- You were a cop in Chicago?
Then you know
about Jimmy Serrano.
Do you have a right to ask questions?
- I think I do.
No, you don't.
- I think I do.
No, you don't.
- Why not?
Dinner's over. Let's go.
I can see this is gonna be
some fuckin' trip, boy.
I wouldn't worry.
I won't be with you much longer.
What do you mean?
Knowing about Serrano, if I go to jail,
I'll be dead within 24 hours.
So sooner or later,
I'll have to give you the slip.
Sure.
Glad you find it humorous.
Let's go.
- All you're leaving is $2?
That's 15 percent.
- That's 13 percent.
These people depend on tips
for a living.
Can I help you, sir?
Yeah, I'm looking for my buddy,
Jack Walsh.
He told me he'd meet me
on this train.
Yeah, Mr. Walsh.
He's in Bedroom "D", next car.
That next car?
- Yes, sir, that way.
Thanks.
- Sure thing. Have a good night.
One word and you're dead, asshole.
Holy shit! Son of a...
How the fuck you find out where I am?
- I ain't tellin' you shit!
Don't force me to do something!
- What's goin' on in here?
All right. Everything's under control.
Take it easy. Alonzo Mosely, FBl.
Radio ahead. I want the local police
at the next stop to arrest this man.
What the fuck are you talkin' about?
- That's enough out of you!
Get on the horn
and call the cops.
Is this good or bad news?
Mardukas and Walsh are on the Amtrak
headed to Los Angeles.
Another bounty hunter was arrested
after he tried to take Mardukas away.
I want the jet ready in 20 minutes.
Where's Jack Walsh?
He got off with the other guy
two or three stops ago.
His real name's Mosely.
- I'm Mosely!
I wanna make a collect call
to Eddie Mascone from Jack Walsh.
Mascone. Bail bonds.
- Jerry, it's Jack. Put Eddie on.
Jesus, Jack! Where the hell you been?
- I wanna talk to him. Where are you?
Where am I?
I wanna ask you somethin'.
How come Dorfler is on my ass? Did you
put him on this, you son of a bitch?
Wait a minute. Dorfler...
How could I put Dorfler on you?
I don't know where you are.
You had nothin' to do with it?
- Where are you? You got the Duke?
You're damn right I got him.
- Where are you?
Where am I? I'm somewhere between...
I don't know... Toledo and Cleveland.
We're gettin' on a bus.
- Bingo.
Bus? Don't get on a...
Are you outta your mind?
Shut up and listen.
We're gettin' on a bus.
I wanted to let you know
we're on our way. Bye.
Don't hang up!
Shit! What the hell
is this guy doin'?
I don't know.
Listen, maybe I oughta get
some donuts or somethin', huh?
Two one-way tickets to Los Angeles.
Still gonna make our schedule.
- I'll get you there on time.
Don't have any illusions.
lllusions?
- Illusions. Illusions.
I'm sorry, sir.
This card's been cancelled.
Huh? Has it been cancelled?
I'm sorry. That's a mistake.
Would you please try it again?
I checked it twice, sir.
- Please try it again.
Did you pay the bill?
- Shut up.
I'm sorry, sir.
It's been cancelled.
Ma'am, that is impossible.
I pay my bills.
There is no way
that could be cancelled. Shut up.
Please.
- It's cancelled, sir.
Would you like to try
another credit card or cash?
I don't have any other credit cards.
Please, just try that again.
All right.
Alonzo...Jack Walsh,
Federal Bureau of Investigation.
This is official business.
This man's in my custody.
I'm taking him to Los Angeles, okay?
Please try again.
Jack Walsh is not the name
on that badge, sir.
Would you like me to call the FBl?
Or would you like to pay cash?
How much is it?
- $264 for two tickets.
Here's a hundred.
Got any money on ya?
- A lot.
You call that a lot? Enough
to get you where I'm gonna get you.
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.
Got the whole fuckin' force
after me, huh?
Who the fuck are you?
- Special Agent Mosely, FBl.
Oh, goddamn it!
I didn't do anything.
Relax. Just wanna ask you
a few questions.
Yeah. Fuckin' "A". Help yourself.
What do you know
about Jack Walsh?
No. Come on. Come on.
Cigarettes are killers.
So are women.
- Not the right woman.
My wife stuck it out
with me through all of this.
Yeah, stuck it out with you
and all your millions. What a trooper.
I don't have millions, Jack.
I gave it all to charity, remember?
You didn't keep a little
for yourself?
I kept enough to get away and hide.
- Yeah, right.
When we change buses in Chicago,
you're gonna have a couple hours.
Be a better man. Use that time
to look up your ex-wife and daughter.
It's a perfect opportunity.
- Why don't you mind your own business?
Why is it you haven't seen them
in nine years?
Why?
Just to get you off my back, I'll tell
you. She married a police lieutenant.
And I'm not very popular
with the Chicago Police Department.
Why aren't you popular
with the Chicago Police Department?
What, do we know each other?
Get... What a... Take...
Why?
What did you do? Why aren't you popular
with the Chicago Police Department?
That really doesn't concern you.
- Did she hurt you, Jack?
Yeah.
- I'm sorry.
What are you sorry about?
- I'm sorry you're hurt.
I'm not hurt.
- You just said you were hurt.
I didn't say I was hurt.
You said I was hurt.
I asked if you were hurt,
and you said, "Yeah, I'm hurt".
You made me say it.
You put words in my mouth.
You're a grown man.
You have control over your own words.
Goddamn right I do. So, here come
two words for you. Shut the fuck up.
Excuse me. Walsh called Mascone about
a half an hour ago from outside Toledo.
He's on an interstate Coach Lines bus
headed for Chicago.
Come on.
Sir, what do we do with this guy?
Let him go.
Son of a bitch stole my cigarettes.
When's the last time
you had a chest X ray?
You know about secondary smoke?
You could give people lung cancer...
who are innocent
and tryin' to live healthy lives.
Why don't you just go back to sleep?
Leave me alone.
Do whatever you have to do.
- Put the cigarette out.
Why don't you shut up
and leave me alone?
Put the cigarette out, Jack.
Put the cigarette out.
A pain in the ass this guy is.
Thank you.
I thought you were putting it out.
No, I'm not putting it out.
Why aren't you popular
with the Chicago Police Department?
Sid's downstairs.
What's up?
- I think you and I should talk.
What are you hangin' around for?
Take a walk.
Somebody picked up Mardukas.
- It's old news. I'm on it.
I don't have to tell you what'll happen
if he becomes a government witness.
That won't be the case.
I assumed you were taking that position,
but I advise you against such action.
Relax. Have a cream soda. Everything
will be all over within a few minutes.
Who are these guys?
Hands on the bus!
All right, spread 'em.
It's the Feds.
Remember me?
Agent Foster Grant.
Alonzo, won't you thank me
for doin' your job?
Thank you, Walsh.
Let's get the fuck outta here!
What the hell are you doing?
- Keep moving.
Relax.
- No! Come on!
Hurry it up.
- What are you doin'? Are you there?
Wait a minute. Jesus Christ!
All right, I'm comin'!
Come on!
- I'm coming! Wait a minute!
Walsh, you son of a bitch!
God! My God!
- Shut up.
What the hell was that?
Why were they shooting?
Those are Serrano's people. They're not
waiting for you to get to jail.
You're turnin' me in.
Why are we runnin' away from the FBl?
I gotta bring you back myself,
otherwise I won't get my money.
I won't give you to the Feds.
"Alonzo Mosely".
Isn't that the name you've been using?
Let me see that.
Look at this wealth of information.
They got a tap on Mascone's line.
Son of a bitch!
What are ya doin'?
How far do you think we'll get
in a stolen FBl car?
What's that for?
- An inside joke between me and Alonzo.
Tony Darvo, line one.
- Yeah?
Sorry. It didn't happen.
It didn't happen? Say that again.
- It didn't happen.
There were cops all over the place.
A million fuckin' Feds.
It was a mess.
It was a real mess.
- Get off the line.
If they've got a tap...
Sidney, shut your fuckin' mouth!
Now listen to me, dummy.
Do they have Mardukas in custody or not?
I don't know. The cops
are swarming all over the place.
We couldn't see anything.
- Let me tell you something.
I don't wanna get another phone call
like this, because if I do...
I'm gonna get on a fuckin' plane,
and blow torch the both of you.
Understand?
Are you gonna stop?
I'm on the phone! What are you doin'?
I should've killed Walsh
in Chicago a long time ago.
Don't say a fuckin' word to me, Sidney.
I'll bury this telephone in your head.
I can't believe this. I haven't seen
either of them in nine years...
and the first thing out of my mouth is,
"Can I borrow a few hundred bucks?"
I have a feeling this is gonna be
very good for you.
You look fine.
Who are you guys?
- I'm your mother's ex-husband.
Mom!
- Nice kid.
Hi, Gail.
- Hello.
How're ya doin'?
- I'm doin' good.
They mentioned you and him
on the news this morning.
They did?
- Yeah.
What'd they say?
Anything good?
No. Are you all right?
Yeah.
You're in a lot of trouble, Jack.
Can I come in
for a few minutes?
Can I come in for a few minutes?
Yeah.
I won't stay long. I just need
to borrow some money to get to L.A.
You know I'm good for it.
I don't have that kind of cash
in the house.
I'm so embarrassed.
I'm just in a jam, Gail.
You look beautiful.
You don't look like a criminal.
- I'm a white-collar criminal.
Jason, go upstairs now.
You shouldn't be here. If Ted comes
home, he's gonna arrest you and him.
Arrest us?
- Yeah.
Then we'd be in a lot of trouble, 'cause
I'm a little short of bribe money.
All right, Jack, don't start.
Please, don't.
How is Lieutenant whatever-his-name-is?
It's captain now.
- Oh, captain? Royalty.
I don't want any trouble.
Do you understand? Please.
It is not a good day for this.
I mean it.
I'm sorry my fugitive timetable doesn't
coincide with your social calendar.
I don't think she was saying that.
- Stay out of this, Jon.
Same Jack. You get your feelings hurt,
and then you just hurt everybody else.
I don't need one of your lectures.
- I'm not lecturing you.
I'm trying to protect you!
Ted is going to be home any minute.
We're all going out.
It's an important night for us.
What's so important about tonight?
Let me guess. Is it payoff night?
That's it! Get out!
- Let's not fight.
I'm in a big fuckin' jam!
I need to borrow some money...
to get this guy to L.A., and I'm out of
this miserable fuckin' business forever!
Can't you understand that?
Denise?
You got so big.
I'm sorry. I'm gonna go now.
- No, hold on.
I'm sorry, honey.
We're havin' a...
What grade are you in now?
- Eighth.
Are you in the eighth grade?
Here's $40. That's all I've got,
but these are the keys to my car.
It's the station wagon
in the driveway.
I'll tell Ted
that it's in the shop.
And we'll worry about it
when you get back to L.A.
So, does he take good care of you?
Yeah?
That's all I wanted to know.
So what's he gonna say about this?
He'll understand.
- Uh-huh. That's love, you know?
Bye, honey.
Wait. It isn't much.
About $180 baby-sitting money.
- Oh, sweetheart, I can't.
Take it. Please.
I can't, sweetheart.
Hello. I'd like to make a collect call
to Eddie Mascone from Jack Walsh.
Mascone Bail Bonds.
- Jerry, Jack. Put Eddie on the phone.
It's Jack.
- Stop fuckin' around. Where are you?
Where am I? I'm in Boise, Idaho.
No, wait a minute.
I'm in Anchorage, Alaska.
No, wait.
I'm in Casper, Wyoming.
I'm in the lobby of the Howard Johnson's
and I'm wearing a pink carnation.
What are you talkin' about?
I'm not talkin' to you.
I'm talkin' to the other guys.
What other guys?
- Let me describe the scene to you.
There's these guys, see?
They've probably been up for two days.
They stink of B.O.
They have coffee breath.
They're constipated from
sittin' on their asses for so long.
They're in a van, probably parked
right up the street from your office.
But you guys are gonna have
to pack up your shit and go home...
because I'm onto you,
you dumb fucks.
Your phone is tapped. I'm not gonna use
this line anymore. Go to Chin Loo's.
I'll call you there in five minutes.
They can't run a tap that fast.
So long, everybody.
Excuse me, buddy. I got it!
I think it's for me. Jack, that you?
Listen. Wire me $500 to the Western
Union in Amarillo, Texas right away.
What do you need with $500 on a bus?
And why the fuck aren't you on a plane?
Did it ever occur to you that I am
a professional and have my reasons?
We are driving now, and I only have
enough cash to get to Amarillo.
We scrapped the bus.
Fuck the bus! I wanna know
what happened to the goddamn plane!
He doesn't like to fly.
- He doesn't like to fly?!
What the fuck does that mean?
Listen to me, Jack!
You gotta be back here in less
than two and a half fuckin' days.
A half million dollars of my money!
What the fuck is goin' on there?
Eddie, Eddie, Eddie,
I swear to God, don't start with me...
or I will shoot him and I will dump him
in a fuckin' swamp!
I am in no fuckin' mood for this.
Just send me the money, and
I'll have him back by the deadline.
You hear me?
- Yes.
Let's go.
Jerry, wire $500 to Jack Walsh
in Amarillo, Texas right away.
Amarillo, Texas.
Also, get Dorfler down there!
Find him and get him down there too.
You got it, Eddie.
- Shit!
One of those bottles of beer
should fall
Ninety-six bottles
of beer on the wall
Nine...
Ninety-three bottles
of beer on the wall
Why were you so unpopular
with the Chicago Police Department?
'Cause of your personality?
What happened at your house?
What was that all about?
Your wife married
a corrupt police officer?
What was it all about?
That whole fuckin' department
was corrupt.
There's good and bad everywhere,
don't you think?
I'd say there's bad everywhere.
Good I don't know about.
What happened to you?
I wouldn't go on the payroll.
What payroll?
I was workin' undercover.
I was...
posted to this big heroin dealer
in Chicago.
Think he supplied the whole city.
Took me a year
just to get his confidence.
Just when I was about to nail the son
of a bitch, my fellow officers...
mysteriously discovered
seven pounds of heroin in my house.
So this big-time drug dealer
gave me a choice:
Get on the payroll like everybody else,
get out of town...
or go to jail for 30 years.
Well, I didn't get on the payroll.
And that's why I do this.
So when I find a criminal like you,
I bring him in.
I don't worry about anybody takin' a
payoff. There is no anybody, just me.
Why don't you get a new watch?
- I'll tell you when I know you better.
When are you gonna get to know me
better? I'll get to know you better.
You're not gonna know me better.
- Will you shut up?
That's what I mean.
How much money do we have left?
That's it?
- That's it.
We're starvin',
and you're buying cigarettes?
I need these cigarettes.
You have your whatever you're
gonna have. I'll have this.
What can I do for you boys?
- Coffee, please.
How much is the coffee?
- It's 53 cents.
How much is tea?
- Fifty-three cents.
I'll have tea.
Okay, and our breakfast special today
is chorizo and eggs.
Chorizo and eggs?
- Chorizo and eggs. Yes.
What is that?
- It's a Mexican sausage...
mixed in with scrambled eggs, and
it comes with hash browns and toast.
Won't be havin' that. Thank you.
What time you got?
- It's ten to 9:00.
In ten minutes, we'll be at the Western
Union office, we'll have 500 bucks.
I'll buy ya a juicy steak
or what ever you want, okay?
Chorizo and eggs?
Chorizo and eggs?
- I'll get you whatever you want.
You know, Jon, you're in this mess
because you're in this mess.
I didn't put you in this mess.
Do you understand?
If you had left Jimmy Serrano alone,
this wouldn't be happening.
Thank you.
I had a way out of this.
Oh, yeah?
What's the thing Serrano's
most afraid of?
Goin' cross-country with you.
Gettin' knocked off
by his own people.
What I know
his financial transactions...
would not only put him away, but every
mob guy he ever did business with.
That's why he wants to kill me.
I was gonna put all his records
on computer disks.
I figured if things got too rough,
I could always trade them for my life.
What happened?
What happened was I got arrested
before I had a chance to do it.
Why didn't you just leave him alone?
You don't look like the kind of guy
who would be involved in that situation.
Why didn't you leave
that heroin dealer alone?
I was a mob accountant.
I thought I worked
in a legitimate firm.
When I found out I was managing
accounts who were friends for Serrano...
I couldn't just sit back
and do nothing.
But you still took
what didn't belong to you.
How can you be on a mobster's side?
- I'm not on a mobster's side?
You're on his if you're not on mine
- I'm not on anybody's side.
I got nothin' to do with it.
- You've got everything to do with it.
You're takin' me to jail
where you know I'll be killed.
That's not my problem.
- It's not your problem?
It's not your problem?
Did you read about me in the papers?
- Yeah, I did.
Were you on my side then?
- Yeah, I was.
Then why aren't you now?
- Because now you're in my way.
I'm in your way?
You want the money for turning me
in because that's all you're about.
You're just about the fuckin' money.
Hey, Jon, you think
whatever you wanna think.
Doesn't matter to me cause I'm gettin'
my $100.000 any which way you want it.
Let's go.
Hey, Tony. Hop-Along... Che si dice.
Got your camera. Take a picture.
Should I get one of these
at the airport?
Put that away.
I'm not gonna tell you again.
Tony, there they are.
How you doing, Jack?
Jimmy sends his regards.
Don't worry. We're not here for you.
We're here for him.
What are you staring at?
Are you gonna propose?
Drop 'em!
I said, drop 'em, assholes!
Who the fuck are you guys?
- Who the fuck are you?
You're dead.
You know who you're fuckin' with?
No. Why don't you tell me?
Make sure you speak into the microphone.
Very clever.
Give me the keys.
Come on, give me the keys!
The keys.
Looks like a package deal.
Goddamn it! Come on, both of you!
Who were those guys?
- You did it this time.
What are you talking about?
- Those are hired killers.
Hired to kill who?
- Hired to kill this guy.
Me. Can you believe it?
Hired by who?
- Jimmy Serrano, that's who.
Fuck. Why do they
wanna kill this guy?
Don't you read the papers?
I read the fucking papers.
They got away. Gray Dodge.
Get after 'em.
How did you know where we were?
Shut up.
Did Eddie put you on this?
- Of course.
That son of a bitch.
I have a contract with him.
A contract?
- I signed it Monday.
He called me.
Said you were fucking this up.
I'm not fucking anything up.
- You should've been in L.A. 2 days ago.
Don't tell me how to do my job.
I'm thinking not to turn him in
just to watch Eddie go down the toilet.
That's a good thought.
- What? Who's talkin' to you?
Yeah, who's talking to you?
He's not yours to take. He's mine.
Hear that?
Who the fuck is this?
Jesus Christ!
Do something!
You guys are the dumbest
bounty hunters I've ever seen!
You couldn't even deliver
a bottle of milk!
Will you shut the fuck up?
Where did he go?
- You think we lost him?
I don't see anything.
- I'm sure we're completely safe.
You all right?
- I'm fine. I'm enjoying it.
Marvin, give me a gun.
No fuckin' way.
Give me a gun!
- Give him a gun!
Don't fuck me.
Yeah, yeah.
Shit.
They're not after me.
Just kidding.
You threw those away.
Always check the evidence.
Those were car keys.
There goes a hundred grand.
Eddie was gonna pay you a hundred?
What was he gonna pay you?
Twenty-five.
Son of a bitch!
Holy shit!
You got 'em.
What the hell are you doin'?
See you in L.A.
Jon, where the fuck are you?
Give me your hand.
I'm slipping. I can't hold on.
Where are you goin'?
Good.
Promise to let me go?
Do you promise to let me go?
Fuck you.
- Promise to let me go!
You're making it very difficult
for me to do the right thing.
I promise I'll let you go.
Oh, Jesus.
You all right?
- Yeah.
Thanks for saving my life.
Thanks for letting me go.
I'll let you go the second
you're in L.A. County Jail.
Come on.
That's right, down here!
Are you gonna stand with your thumb
up your ass or get me outta here?
This just came in.
Is this gonna upset me?
I think it's safe to say that.
Are you familiar with a potato dish,
lyonnaise potato?
It's a kind of fried potato.
But it's got an onion in it.
It's quite delicious.
It really goes beautifully
with steak, chops...
hamburger, cheeseburger,
any of your meat dishes.
It's just that
I have enough money to buy...
as much lyonnaise potatoes
as you ever...
Shut the fuck up.
I think you oughta think about it
a little bit, because it's nothing...
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Oh, thank you, thank you.
Cover that.
Think you could give us a ride
to the next town?
Sure, jump in the back.
- Thanks a lot.
For every shit,
there's six nice people.
What's that?
- It's "hello".
I can say hello
in a lot of different languages.
Not yours, but a lot of them.
Welcome, sir.
I'm not lookin' forward to this.
- You think I am?
I don't understand your problem.
The guy's an accountant.
It's been bad luck.
Plus Walsh is good.
If he's that good,
maybe I should hire him to hit you.
I hope there's no chance of any of this
coming back to Jimmy.
No chance. Rented the chopper
out of Kansas City.
He's five times removed from you.
You're clear of this.
Clear as shit, you fuckin' moron!
The guy's still out there.
Let me tell you something.
I'm not interested...
in seeing either of you alive again
until you get the accountant, got it?
The end of the ride.
- This is it?
Is there a real town around here?
Channing's.
Yeah.
How far is that?
- Thirty miles.
Thirty miles. Jesus Christ.
What the hell kind of town is this?
Is there someone that can give us
a ride to Channing?
Is anyone going in that direction?
- No have a ride.
Excuse me. Is there a bathroom
in there I could use?
Is there a telephone here?
Telephone.
No telephone.
No telephone? Nothing.
Yeah, glad you're having a good time.
Fear of flying, you son of a bitch!
Get back here, you son of a bitch!
Get over here.
Stop!
Fear of flying, my ass!
You son of a bitch, get out!
You're a goddamn pilot,
you son of a bitch?
I didn't feel it was appropriate
to share that with you.
I'm gonna fuckin' appropriate your head!
How do you turn this off?
Turn it off!
Hang in there.
I'm gonna let it down easy.
Oh, shit!
You're a goddamn pilot?
You're a pilot?
I'll show you pilot!
You'll love the coffee shop I'm opening
after I dump you and get my $100 grand.
All right, get back!
Get back! Everybody, back!
Give me the keys to the truck.
- You can't steal their truck.
You were about to steal a plane!
- I'm trying to save my life!
I should give 'em something.
Give me your watch.
- My watch? Shit!
Keep it.
It's worth a lot of money.
Get in. Stand back!
Get in. Get in!
Let's be fair about this.
You lied to me first.
At the river.
Get the...
At the river!
You lied to me first.
You got some fuckin' nerve.
No, you lied to me first.
- You lied to me first.
Yes! I lied to you first,
but you had no knowledge I was lying...
about my fear of flying at the river
when you lied to me first.
So as far as you knew,
you lied to me first.
I can't argue with you.
I don't know what you're talking about.
You're saying you lied to me first
as far as you knew.
What's the matter?
- I got an ulcer.
Yeah, I've got a fuckin' ulcer.
All your bullshit started it bleeding.
You know why you have an ulcer? Because
you have two forms of expression.
Silence and rage!
Get some milk to coat it.
Don't tell me what I need.
I need something to eat.
What will we buy it with? Dirt?
Drive to the next town.
I'll take care of it.
You'll take care of it?
What do you mean?
Drive to the next town.
But you lied first.
Now what?
- Give me that FBl badge.
The FBl badge?
Yeah, the FBl badge.
Uncuff me.
Uncuff you?
- Uncuff me.
Do you want to eat a nice meal?
Want some of that shit you eat?
Come on, uncuff me.
You fuck with me...
You'll hit me on the head
and drop in a thing.
Uncuff me.
Who's in charge here?
- Who wants to know?
Me.
The manager.
I'd like to see the manager
as soon as possible.
Yes, sir.
Sorry.
Yeah?
- Alonzo Mosely, FBl.
We've been tracking counterfeiters
passing phony $20 bills.
Have you received any $20 bills
in the last couple of hours?
Sure, all the time.
You get them all the time.
Would you take two steps backwards?
Would you mind
opening the register?
Don't touch 'em.
Excuse me.
Contract two, Hank.
Check 'em out.
Give him a pencil, please.
Do the litmus configuration.
You're doing the litmus configuration?
- Litmus configuration.
You seen any suspicious-looking
characters around here?
Do you live around here?
- Yeah.
How's it look?
- This one's bad.
Describe what the last man who passed
a $20 bill looked like.
Thirty. Tall.
About six feet tall?
- Six-five.
Dark brown hair?
- Light colored.
Sounds like our man.
- That's him.
We have to take these bills
for evidence. Make 'em a receipt.
This one's bad, too.
Notify the other establishments
of the situation.
What's the name of your establishment?
- Red's Corner Bar.
Are you Red?
Do you dye your hair?
Why do they call you Red?
It's short for Red Wood.
My last name's Wood.
What's your first name?
- Bill.
Thank you for your cooperation, Bill.
Hank.
These are all bad.
Those are good.
We're gonna get this train.
- What?
We're gonna catch this train.
- I can't catch a train.
You also couldn't fly. Start runnin'.
- Wait! It's a freight train!
I can't do this!
I deeply feel I can't do this!
You like to travel by train.
Get up there!
What are you doin'?
- You promise to let me go?
Open the fuckin' door!
- See you in the next life.
Son of a bitch!
Open that fuckin' door!
Glad to see me?
I guess we're in the next life.
Don't overreact now.
- Don't overreact.
I won't overreact!
Get over here!
React? You do this again,
I'll throw you off the fuckin' train!
It's a bad...
Put your hand in there!
- All right. Easy, Jack.
There!
You son of a bitch!
You shut up! I'm not talking
to you for the rest of this trip!
Are you guys gonna let me go?
I don't know anything.
Is that a fact?
Shit.
Why don't you quit?
Be cheaper for both of us.
Where are they?
- You got me.
Inspector?
- Shut up!
You listen, you son of a bitch.
I want answers right now!
What do you want?
I don't know nothin'.
It seems that an Agent Alonzo Mosely
and his partner...
were seen hopping a westbound
freight train near Channing.
Come on.
Jack? What?
How much further?
None of your fuckin' business!
Eventually I'll have to go
to the bathroom.
Shut the fuck up!
Did you ever have sex with an animal?
Remember those chickens
around the Indian reservation?
There's some good-lookin' chickens.
You know, between us.
There were a couple there
I might have taken a shot at.
What's with you and that watch?
You told me about
your feelings for chickens.
How private could the watch be?
What's the big secret?
Gail bought me this watch.
It was the first thing she ever gave me.
She bought it because I was always late
at least a half an hour.
So she bought it and set it ahead a
half an hour so I'd never be late.
Somewhere in the back of my mind I keep
thinking we'll wind up together again.
I don't know why I'm still hangin' on,
I'm still waitin' around.
I don't think she's comin' back.
I don't either.
Sometimes you just have to let go.
Just get yourself a new watch.
You're okay.
I think under
different circumstances...
you and I...
probably still would've
hated each other.
We probably could've been friends.
In the next life.
Yeah, the next life.
Great.
Accommodations were wonderful.
You got a smoke?
- Don't smoke.
That Fed took my cigarettes.
- You want your cigarettes back?
You'll have to go to Flagstaff
to get 'em...
'cause that's where
your pal Mosely went.
Just might do that.
Where are we?
My guess is Arizona. We've been going
west all night. I think we're near home.
I'm almost dead.
Look, the witness protection program
isn't so bad.
They'll give you a new name,
a new life.
I won't make it
to any witness protection program.
You don't know that.
- I know that, and you know that.
Serrano's gonna get to me before I get
to any witness protection program.
Do me a favor.
Don't pretend you care about me.
It really insults my intelligence.
Let's face it. The only important thing
about me to you is getting your money.
I'm tired of you making me out
to be some thug...
whose only concern
is a big chunk of change.
Did you know Serrano's people
offered me a million bucks for you?
Why don't you go for the big money?
You're doing his work for him anyway.
Working for him... You don't know
what you're talkin' about.
I do this shit 'cause I wouldn't work
for that low-life asshole.
What does that mean?
- Nothing. It doesn't mean anything.
Serrano is the heroin dealer
you told me about in Chicago?
Who owned your buddies and destroyed
your life? That's Serrano?
That's the guy
that you're takin' me in...
That's the guy
that's gonna kill me?
Hope it's a wonderful coffee shop.
Come on, we're gettin' off here.
- What?
We are getting off here,
Mr. Railroad Man. Come on.
What? No! What are you talking about?
Let's discuss this.
Find anything?
- Not yet.
They could've jumped off the train
anywhere along the line.
Trains have regularly scheduled stops.
The reason is 'cause people plan
to get off the trains when they stop.
That's how, generally, people do it.
They don't throw each other off.
That's the purpose of having stops.
What's this?
What are you gonna do now?
What are you doin'?
Oh, Christ! Christ!
Come on! Are you kidding?
They're gonna come out and shoot us,
for Chris sake.
What the hell?
Jesus. Oh, great!
You get it started,
and I'll run you over.
That's the best plan
I can think of.
Congratulations. Another crime.
Come on.
I don't like anything you do,
to tell you the truth. Nothing.
Where are we going?
- To the nearest airport.
I'm not the kind of guy that says,
"l told ya so".
Shit!
They've been spotted
There are officers in pursuit.
Take the chopper.
This is the kind of situation
where something bad happens.
Easy!
Goddamn it!
I don't like this!
Truck!
Where are we going?
- You'll find out when we get there.
I've come too far.
Too far.
I'm too close.
Okay, I'm coming!
All right.
Come on.
- Right.
Here we go.
Hello!
Am I lucky or am I just good?
Is that Marvin?
- Fuckin' "A", I'm the best.
Hello, Jack, ya dumb shit.
Come on, you fuckin' pain in the ass!
- Wait a minute!
If you move,
I'll tear your fuckin' lungs out!
See you in L.A.
Shit!
Afternoon, sir.
You open?
- We're always open.
Hard day?
Hard week.
I know what you mean.
I could use a cup of coffee.
Thanks.
- You're welcome.
Keep it.
Gee, I've been lookin' all over
for these. Thanks, Alonzo.
Marvin, I have to tell ya,
I have this very serious fear of flying.
Yeah? Why don't you just relax
and sleep through it?
Forget your deadline. It's over.
That's the way that one went.
I know my rights.
You owe me phone calls.
Phone calls are not of paramount
importance to you right now.
It's that you're gonna spend ten years
for impersonating a federal agent.
Ten years for impersonating a Fed?
How come no one's after you?
Give this guy his calls.
Thanks.
Can I have a little privacy, please?
Mascone Bail Bonds.
It's Jack Walsh. Put Eddie on.
- It's Jack.
This better be good news
because you got five hours left.
It's not. I'm calling to let you know
that you're a dead motherfucker.
Wait a minute.
You put Marvin on this case,
you fuckin' piece of shit.
You fucking deceptive... You vermin!
- Are you fuckin' done yet?
You slime ball in a sea of pus!
What?
You blew it, all right?
You had the guy four fuckin' days.
Four days!
You could've walked him backwards
and not blown it, but you blew it.
When have I ever let you down,
you fuckin' rat?
Are you nuts, telling Dorfler
I offered you $100.000...
when I told him I'd give him $25.000?
Wait a minute.
When did you speak to him?
What's the difference?
- When did you speak to Marvin?
He called me ten minutes ago
tellin' me to go fuck myself.
Everybody's tellin' me
to go fuck myself.
Am I supposed to just sit
on my fuckin' butt?
Eddie, Eddie,
what are you talkin' about?
You got five hours left. Can you bring
the fuckin' Duke in, yes or no?
I thought he's bringin' him.
I just talked to fuckin' Dorfler.
He don't have the Duke.
What?
- Where's the fuckin' Duke?
Hello?
- I'll talk to you later.
Jack!
Hello?
- Tony Darvo, please?
Who's calling?
- Marvin Dorfler.
Yo?
- Shall I put Marvin Dorfler through?
Yeah, put him through.
Marvin, everything's still
on schedule, pal, isn't it?
So Dorfler's working for you guys.
Who is this?
- This is Jack Walsh.
Jack, what are you complaining for?
We came to you first, didn't we?
It's Jack Walsh.
Hold on. Somebody wants to say hello.
Hey, too late for you, scumbag.
No, too late for you. I didn't come
this far not to collect my money.
You understand me?
I want the Duke back.
What the fuck you telling me for?
- What am I telling you for?
I'll tell you what
I'm telling you for.
I got some of the Duke's belongings,
including computer disks telling...
of Serrano's businesses, his
money-laundering operations, everything.
If I don't get the Duke back
in the next two hours...
I'm gonna turn those disks over
to the Feds, do you hear me?
I wanna meet Serrano with the Duke
in two hours at McCarran Airport...
where we'll make the exchange.
He's the only one who won't try
to take a shot at me in a public place.
If I see one goon within a mile
of that airport...
Listen to me carefully, the deal is off.
and I'm goin' to the Feds.
I ain't gonna bother Jimmy
with your bullshit.
You're not? Fine.
After he's busted, I'll make sure
to let him know you knew beforehand.
That's two hours from now,
McCarran Airport.
You got that, moron?
Have a nice day.
Tell Alonzo I wanna make a deal.
You wanna make a deal with me?
What would you do
if I deliver Serrano?
What do you mean, "deliver"?
- Conspiracy to destroy evidence.
What government evidence?
Will you let me take the Duke back
myself and collect my money?
Tell me more.
I'll tell you on the way. We have
to be in Las Vegas in two hours.
Marvin!
- No, it's room service.
Here, hold this up
so they know I took this today.
I amaze myself.
I'm always thinkin'.
Got it all figured out.
Say "cheese".
Don't do this.
Adios.
There are no real computer disks.
Is that right?
Right.
If you give him blank disks and
he accepts them, is that an overt act?
If he just sets foot inside the airport,
he's committed an overt act:
conspiracy to obstruct justice.
When he shows up with the Duke,
you add kidnapping.
Anybody packing a gun:
conspiracy to commit murder.
The fact it's an airport, and Alonzo,
correct me if you think I'm wrong...
you can slap an interstate
transportation racketeering rap on him.
None of that means anything unless
you can get him to take those disks.
Don't worry.
I'll get him to take the disks.
Get a wire on this man.
No hard feelings about
what happened in Amarillo, huh?
Just one of those
spur-of-the-moment deals.
Where is he?
- Where's the money?
In the car.
Where is he?
Change of plans. I want two million.
- What?
I read the newspapers.
The guy got you for 15 million, right?
So I figure he's gotta be worth
at least two.
I'm a businessman.
How do we know you got him?
I want one million now...
then I'll call ya in 20 minutes...
tell you where to drop off
the second million.
Once I know it's there,
then I'll tell ya where he is, okay?
Not okay.
- Why not?
Are you nuts? What's Jimmy gonna say?
How are we gonna get the Duke now?
You got the answer in your hand.
- What are you talkin' about?
Think. When are you gonna learn
how to pay attention?
Look. See what it says there?
All right, this is it.
Tonight is the fuckin' night.
You understand?
I'm sick of all these screw-ups.
As soon as I get the disks from Walsh,
you drop Walsh and the Duke.
Understand? I get the disks,
you drop them. Okay?
You shouldn't do this.
Really?
What do you propose I do?
Send somebody with a cash offer,
but don't do this.
I know Walsh.
He won't take any money from me.
He's a self-righteous guy.
It aggravates me.
In his mind, this is clean. He gets
what he wants, I get what I want.
The guy's a fuckin' burnout.
Sit down, relax. Have a sandwich,
glass of milk. Do some fuckin' thing.
He's on his way.
He's heading north
on Las Vegas Boulevard.
Two miles from the airport.
We're on him.
Why are you smiling?
I feel like a cop again.
I'm finally in the presence
of greatness, huh?
The Duke.
The guy that steals money
from the scum of the earth...
and gives it to the unfortunates
of the world.
I wanted to meet you face-to-face.
Did you actually think you were gonna
steal my money and get away with it?
I stopped by here
to tell you two things.
Number one is that
you're gonna die tonight.
Number two, I'm gonna go home...
have a nice hot meal.
I'm gonna find your wife,
and I'm gonna kill her, too.
Joey, wait here for my call.
The rest of you start headin' in.
Here he comes.
Jack, long time, no see.
- Long time, no see.
You're still spendin'
all your money on clothes.
You know.
While you're in town...
if you wanna see as how, want
a free meal, let me know, it's on me.
That's the type of guy I am.
- You're a real sport.
Just give him the disks.
How's your mother?
- She's all right.
Daughter's gettin' big?
Growing up?
I was thinkin' maybe if we would've
done business way back when...
you wouldn't look like a guy
with a fuckin' cup in your hand.
I'm trying to make a living.
Jack, you got those disks...
or did you lose them
like you lost your job?
Give him the disks, Walsh.
I see you, but I don't see the Duke.
We'll worry about him in a minute.
- We'll worry about him now.
Let me tell you something, Jimmy,
this isn't a reunion.
If I don't see the Duke
in about five seconds, I'm walkin'.
You know,
you're still way too serious.
Really. Listen, why don't you
hand over the tapes?
We'll go get the guy together.
- I'll see you at the arraignment.
Hey Jack.
Where is he going?
You win. All right?
- I what?
You won. You want me to yell it
over this airport?
Where is he?
He's on his way.
- I said no goons.
Never mind him. You'll get what
you want. Didn't I just tell you that?
This is gonna give me a heart attack.
I know I'm gonna have a heart attack.
Since we have this moment,
there's something I've meant to ask you.
Doesn't it bother you that
another copper is fuckin' your wife?
Do you know they made
this guy a captain?
Can you imagine that? Go figure.
Made him a captain.
May I help you, sir?
- Give me a one-way ticket to L.A.
One-way ticket to Los Angeles.
Will that be smoking or non-smoking?
Take a wild guess.
Smoking.
How will you be paying for this, sir?
Shit. Look.
- What is it?
What the hell is he doing here?
A male Caucasian carrying a green
duffel bag, approaching the subjects.
Get him out of there as quickly
and quietly as possible.
Shoot him if you have to,
but get him out of here.
You okay?
Stand behind me.
It's all right.
All right, come on.
How's everybody doin'?
- Will you get outta here?
Back off!.
Who the fuck are you?
- Writing a book? Who the fuck are you?
Who is this guy?
- Jesus.
Marvin, you're missin'
the bigger picture here. Get out.
Wire's dead.
I didn't come all this way
for nothing.
Serrano's leaving. I don't know.
- Did he take the disks?
Serrano's got the disks.
- Let him go.
Did he or didn't he take the disks?
- I couldn't tell.
Serrano's got the disks.
He's got the disks.
Marvin, look out!
Look out!
- I'm not falling for that shit again!
Marvin, look out!
You stupid fuck, look out!
Serrano's got the disks!
- Move in.
Take it easy! Come on!
Ow! Goddamn it!
Who the fuck are you guys?
Jimmy, there's something I've been
wanting to say to you for ten years.
What's that?
- You're under arrest.
We'll catch up to each other
one of these days.
Maybe we will.
We still got our deal?
- We got our deal.
Wait a minute! What deal? Why the fuck
does he get special treatment?
See you in L.A.
- Watch your cigarettes with this guy.
What's goin' on?
Sorry. I got an hour and a half
to get you back to L.A. Thanks, Alonzo.
Mascone Bail Bonds.
Hello, Eddie, where's Jerry?
Never mind Jerry. Where are you?
Feds picked him up 20 minutes ago.
Yeah? What for?
- What's the difference?
I never trusted that guy.
Where the hell are you?
Where am I? I'm at the airport.
Guess who I'm with.
I'm with the Duke.
You got him!
You got him, Jack! I love you!
Yeah. You wanna say hello?
- Yeah. Put him on.
Yeah, say hello.
- Hello.
Hello, you son of a bitch!
We got you...
you son of a bitch!
Now say good-bye, ya lying piece
of shit, because I'm lettin' him go.
Jack?
Would've been a nice coffee shop.
Oh, Jesus.
Holy Chri... I don't get it.
I did what I wanted to do.
I got you to L.A. before midnight.
I don't know what to say.
Don't say anything. Knowin' you, you'll
make me wanna put those back on you.
Thanks.
- No, thank you.
Thank you.
Something to remember
our adventure by.
This better be good.
This is good.
This is very good.
When I was making my getaway,
I thought the FBl was closing in on me.
Take it.
I took some traveling money.
Take it.
It's not a payoff. It's a gift.
You already let me go.
You son of a bitch.
You son of a bitch.
- I told you I had money.
I know you had money,
but I didn't know you had money.
How much is here?
- Neighborhood of $300.000.
That's a very respectable neighborhood.
I don't know what to say.
Take care.
Take care.
- See ya in the next life.
See ya in the next life.
Do you know what time it is?
- Twenty-five to 12:00.
Twenty-five to 12:00.
I would've made it.
Would you have change for a thousand?
Are you a comedian?
Get outta here, ya bum!
Looks like I'm walkin'.
