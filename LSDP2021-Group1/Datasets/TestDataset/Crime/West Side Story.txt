MAN: Watch this shot now!
Shoot, man! Go!
Pow! Pow!
Yeah!
Huh.
SHARK 1: Chickie!
Chick, chick, chick!
SHARK 2: Boy! Jet boy!
Jet boy!
Jet, jet, Jets!
JET 1: Come back!
JET 2: Come over here!
Chickens!
ALL: Ha!
ALL: Beat it!
Yeah!
JET 3: All right, go, Jets!
Snowboy!
Come on!
Beat it!
Chico!
Andale, chico!
JET 4: Okay, here we go!
JET 5: Over here, A-Rab!
ACTION:
Jets! Jets!
Bernardo!
Indio! Chaco,
come on!
SHARK 2: Jets, come on!
Follow me, baby.
SHARK 3: Mira, mira, mira!
SHARKS: Hey, Jets!
Andale, chico!
Come on, Jets!
SHARKS: Jets!
Hello!
Jets, come on! Julio!
Come on!
Jets!
Come on, boys!
Come on, now!
Jets!
SCHRANK:
Break it up, you punks!
Cut it out!
Come on, guys!
Break it up, I said!
Come on, break it up!
Come on!
How many times
have I told you punks
to cut this stuff out?
Why, if it ain't
Lt. Schrank!
JETS: Top of the day,
Lt. Schrank.
And Officer Krupke.
SHARKS: Top of the day,
Officer Krupke.
I'll give you
the top of the head.
You, get down!
But we're having
such fun.
We enjoy
the playground.
See, it keeps us
deprived children off
of the foul city streets.
Shut up!
And born like we was
on the hot pavement.
You wanna get
your skull broke?
Baby John,
come here!
Come here!
All right!
Now, which one of
these Puerto Ricans
bloodied you? Huh?
Sir...
Which one?
Excuse me, sir.
As a matter of fact...
...we suspicion
that the job
was done by a cop.
Two cops.
At the very least.
Impossible.
In America,
nothing is impossible.
All right,
wise guys...
...now,
you listen to me!
All of you!
You hoodlums don't
own these streets.
And I've had
all the roughhouse
I'm gonna put up with
around here!
You wanna
kill each other,
kill each other!
But you ain't
gonna do it on my beat!
Are there any questions?
Yes, sir.
Would you mind
translating that
into Spanish?
Get your friends
out of here, Bernardo.
And stay out!
Please.
Okay, Sharks.
Vámonos.
Boy!
As if this neighborhood
wasn't crummy enough!
Now, look, fellas.
Fellas!
Look, let's be
reasonable...
...if I don't get
a little law and order
around here...
...I get busted down
to a traffic corner...
...and your friend
don't like
traffic corners.
That means you're gonna
start makin' nice...
...with the PRs
from now on.
I said nice! Get it?
'Cause if you don't...
...and I catch any of you
doin' any more brawlin'
in my territory...
...I'll beat the livin' crud
out of every one of you...
...and see
you go to the can
and rot there!
Say good-bye to
the nice boys, Krupke.
Good-bye, boys.
"Good-bye, boys."
Jail? Gee.
"You hoodlums
don't own the streets."
Go play in the park.
Keep off
of the grass.
Get out
of the house!
Keep off the block.
Get outta here.
Keep off the world!
A gang that don't own
the street is nothin'!
We do own it!
Come on, Jets,
round out!
Not you, Anybodys!
Beat it!
Riff,
you gotta let me
in the gang!
Didn't you just see me?
I was smash!
I'm a killer, I wanna fight.
How else she
gonna get a guy
to touch her?
You dirty rat!
Come on, the road,
little girl! The road!
Beat it!
ALL: Beat it!
Okay, come on.
Okay, now listen!
Now, we fought hard
for this turf,
and we ain't just
gonna give it up.
The Emeralds claimed it,
we shot 'em out.
The Hawks tried
to take it away,
we knocked them
down the cellar.
But these PRs
are different.
They multiply.
Like cockroaches.
Shut the door!
They're eatin' all the food.
Breathin' all the air.
Help! I'm drowning
in tamale.
And you heard
what that
Lt. Schrank said...
...we gotta make nice
with them
Puerto Ricans or else.
We gotta let 'em move in
right under our noses...
...and take it
all away from us or else.
ALL: No!
You're damn right, no!
So what're we
gonna do, buddy boys?
I'll tell you
what we're gonna do.
We're gonna speed back!
We're gonna move
like lightnin',
and we're gonna
clean them Sharks up...
...once and for all.
So they ain't never gonna
set foot on our turf again!
We're gonna do it
in one all-out fight.
A rumble! Chop, chop!
Now cool, Action Boy.
The Sharks want
a piece of this world, too.
And they're real down boys.
They might ask
for blades...
...zip guns.
Zip guns?
Gee!
I ain't finalizin'
and sayin' they will,
Baby John.
I'm just sayin'
that they might,
and we gotta be prepared.
Now, what's your mood, Jets?
I say go, go!
I say mix!
I say sock 'em!
Tear them!
Yeah, but if they
say blades or guns...
I say let's just
forget the whole thing.
What?
What do you say, Riff?
I say this turf is small,
but it's all we got, huh.
I wanna hold it
like we always held it,
with skin!
But if they say blades,
I say blades.
If they say guns,
I say guns.
I say I want the Jets
to be the number one!
To sail! To hold the sky!
Then rev us off!
Voom va-voom!
RIFF: Okay, cats, we rumble!
Now...
...protocality calls
for a war council...
...between us and the Sharks
to set the whole thing up.
So I will personally
give the bad news
to Bernardo.
You gotta take
a lieutenant with you.
That's me.
That's Tony.
Who needs Tony?
We need Tony!
He's got a rep
that's bigger than
the whole West Side!
He don't belong no more.
Now, cut it, Action!
Me and Tony
started the Jets.
So where is he?
How come he takes a lousy,
stinkin' job?
Youth Board
corrupted him.
Yeah, temporary sickness!
Wait and see.
Remember them fists
the day we clobbered
the Emeralds!
He saved
my ever-loving neck!
Sure! He'll do it
again, too!
He always came through
for us and he always will.
When you're a Jet
you're a Jet all the way
From your first cigarette
to your last dyin' day
When you're a Jet
let 'em do what they can
You've got brothers around
You're a family man
You're never alone
You're never disconnected
You're home with your own
When company's expected
You're well-protected
Then you are set
with a capital 'J'
Which you'll never forget
till they cart you away
When you're a Jet
You stay a
Jet
Now, I know Tony
like I know me,
and I guarantee
you can count him in.
Let's get crackin'.
Where will you
find Bernardo?
It ain't safe
in PR territory.
He'll be at
tonight's gym dance.
But the gym's
neutral territory.
I'm gonna make nice
with him.
I'm only gonna
challenge him.
Right, daddy-o.
So listen,
everybody dress up
sweet and sharp.
Meet Tony and me at
the dance after 10:00,
and walk tall!
We always walk tall!
We're Jets!
The greatest!
When you're a Jet
You're the top cat in town
You're the gold-medal kid
With the heavyweight crown
When you're a Jet
You're the
swinginest thing
Little boy,
you're a man
Little man,
you're a king
The Jets are in gear
Our cylinders are clickin'
The Sharks'll steer clear
'Cause every Puerto Rican's
a lousy chicken
Here come the Jets
Like a bat out of hell
Someone gets in our way
Someone don't feel so well
Here come the Jets
Little world, step aside
Better go underground
Better run, better hide
We're drawin' the line
So keep your noses hidden
We're hangin' a sign
Says "visitors forbidden"
And we ain't kiddin'
Here come the Jets, yeah
And we're gonna beat
Every last buggin' gang
On the whole buggin' street
On the whole buggin'
Ever-lovin'
Street
Yeah!
Tony, you're not
even listenin'.
I read you loud
and clear, Riff.
Then why don't
you say somethin'?
I don't wanna
hurt your feelings.
You're my buddy,
my pal, my best friend!
Womb to tomb?
Birth to earth.
That's why you gotta
come to the dance tonight
and stand up with me.
Come on, Tony.
Just say yes.
Riff, did you ever
stop to figure...
...how many bubbles
there are in one bottle
of this here soda pop?
Tony, this is important!
Everything's important,
Riff...
...you, me,
the sweet guy
I work for.
The Sharks walk bad.
They bite hard.
And if we don't
stop them now...
Here! Work for a living.
How do you like that?
Four and a half years
I live with a buddy
and his family.
I think I'm diggin'
a guy's character.
Boy, am I a victim
of disappointment in you!
End your sufferin',
little man.
Why don't you just
pack up your gear
and move out?
'Cause your ma's
hot for me.
No! It's 'cause
I hate livin'
with my buggin' uncle!
Come on!
Come on, uncle!
Now...
...go play games
with the Jets.
And why not?
They're the greatest.
Ain't they?
Were.
You found
somethin' better?
No. Not yet, but...
But what?
You won't dig it, Riff.
So try me.
Come on, Tony,
try me.
Okay.
Every single night
for the last month,
I wake up...
...and I'm reaching out.
For what?
I don't know.
A dame?
It's right outside the door,
just around the corner...
...but it's comin'.
What is?
I don't know. It...
It's like
the kick I used to get
from bein' a Jet.
Now you're talkin'!
Man, without a gang,
you're an orphan.
With a gang,
you walk in twos,
threes, fours...
...and your
crew is the best...
...when you're a Jet,
you're out in the sun,
buddy boy...
...you're home free home!
Riff, I've had it!
Tony...
Tony, look at me,
will ya?
Come on, look at me.
I'm lookin' at you.
Now, I never asked
the time of day
from a clock, did I?
I never asked
nothin' from nobody,
but I'm askin' you...
...come to
the dance tonight.
I promised Doc
I'd clean up
the store tonight.
Then do it
after the dance.
Tony, I already told
the guys you'd be there.
If you don't show,
I'll be marked lousy.
What time'd
you tell 'em?
For me, Tony,
for Riff!
Womb to tomb?
Birth to earth,
and I'll live
to regret this.
Who knows? Maybe what you're
waitin' for'll be twitchin'
at the dance tonight.
Yeah. Who knows?
Who knows?
Could be
Who knows?
There's somethin'
due any day
I will know right away
Soon as it shows
It may come
cannonballin' down
through the sky
Gleam in its eye,
bright as a rose
Who knows?
It's only
just out of reach
Down the block,
on a beach
Under a tree
I got a feelin'
there's a miracle due
Gonna come true,
comin' to me
Could it be?
Yes, it could
Something's comin',
somethin' good
If I can wait
Something's comin'
I don't know what it is
But it is gonna be great
With a click
With a shock
Phone'll jingle,
door'll knock
Open the latch
Something's comin',
don't know when
But it's soon,
catch the moon
One-handed catch
Around the corner
Or whistlin'
down the river
Come on, deliver
To me
Will it be?
Yes, it will
Maybe just
by holdin' still
It'll be there
Come on, somethin',
come on in
Don't be shy,
meet a guy
Pull up a chair
The air is hummin'
And somethin'
great is comin'
Who knows?
It's only
just out of reach
Down the block,
on a beach
Maybe tonight
Por favor, Anita,
you are my friend.
Stop it, Maria.
You must
make the neck lower.
And you must
stop heckling me.
We are working
on our time now,
not the old lady's.
One inch. How much
can one little inch do?
Too much.
Anita, it is now to
be a dress for dancing,
no longer for praying!
Listen, with those boys,
you can start in dancing
and end up praying.
Querida, one little inch.
Bernardo made me promise!
Bernardo!
One month have
I been in this country.
Do I ever even
touch excitement?
I sew in this place all day.
I sit at home all night.
For what did
my fine brother
bring me here?
To marry Chino.
Chino.
When I look at Chino,
nothing happens.
What do you expect
to happen?
I don't know. Something.
What happens when
you look at Bernardo?
It's when I don't look
that it happens.
I think I will
tell Mama and Papa
about you and Nardo
in the balcony...
...of the movies!
I will rip this
to shreds!
No!
But if you
perhaps could manage
to lower the neck...
Next year.
I hate that dress!
Then don't wear it,
and don't come to the dance
with us tonight.
Don't come?
Could we not dye
it red at least?
No, we could not.
White is for babies.
Mmm-hmm...
I will be the only one
there in a white...
Ah.
Sí.
It is a beautiful dress.
I love you!
Are you ready, ladies?
Nardo, come in.
Is it not beautiful?
Yes.
Very.
I didn't quite hear.
Very beautiful.
Come in, Chino.
Do not be afraid.
But this is a shop
for ladies.
We won't bite you
till we know you better.
Chino, you will keep
both eyes on Maria tonight
in case I cannot.
You too, Anita.
My brother is
a silly watchdog.
My sister
is a precious jewel.
What am I?
Cut glass?
Nardo, it is most important
that I have a wonderful time
at the dancing tonight.
It is?
Because tonight
is the real beginning
of my life...
...as a young lady
of America.
MAN: Let's go!
Get outta here!
SHARK 1: Nardo. Cómo está?
SHARK 2: Chino. Chino!
Pepe! Pepe! Come on, guys!
Maria.
Look what I got.
Maria, these are
some of my friends
you've not met.
Pick up.
This is Loco.
Mucho gusto.
Encantada.
Teresita.
My sister Maria.
Good evening.
And this is
Luis and Rosa.
Encantada.
Rosalia, ai.
Oye, Nardo.
All right, boys and girls.
All right.
Attention, please!
Attention!
Come here.
GLAD HAND: Thank you.
My, this is a fine turnout
we have here tonight.
It's all for you,
Glad Hand.
I know all of you
boys and girls...
...are here
because you want to
make new friends...
...and get closer
to old ones.
CROWD: Yeah!
So, tonight, kids,
we're gonna do
something special.
We're gonna have
a get-together dance!
Ginger! Peachy!
All right, all right,
now, kids, kids...
...I want you to
form two circles.
How many?
Two.
Boys on the outside,
and girls on the inside.
Where are you?
All right.
Now...
...when the music stops...
...each boy dances
with whichever girl
is opposite, okay?
Okay!
Two circles, kids!
Well, it won't
hurt you to try.
It hurts.
It hurts!
It hurts.
Snowboy.
JET: I'm with it.
That's it, kids!
Keep the ball rolling.
Round she goes,
and where she stops,
nobody knows.
All right, here we go.
Boys to my right,
and girls to my left.
Mambo!
Mambo!
Go!
RIFF: Tony!
ALL: Mambo!
Mambo!
You're not thinking
I'm someone else?
I know you are not.
Or that we've met before?
I know we have not.
I felt...
I knew something
never before
was gonna happen...
...had to happen...
...but this is
so much more.
My hands are cold.
Yours, too.
So warm.
So beautiful.
Beautiful.
It's so much to believe.
You're not making a joke?
I have not yet learned
how to joke that way.
I think
now I never will.
Get your hands off,
American!
Nardo!
Stay away from my sister.
Sister?
Couldn't you see
he's one of them?
I saw only him.
They want one thing
from a Puerto Rican girl.
That's a lie!
Later, Tony!
Get away!
Don't listen.
She'll listen to her brother
before she listens
to you.
If you two want
to settle this...
Please, boys!
Everything was
going so well.
Now, come on! We're all here
to have a good time,
aren't we?
Nardo...
Take her out of here.
We're going home.
Nardo, it is
my first dance.
Please.
We are family.
Now go.
Come, Maria.
Maria.
I don't want you.
I want you, though.
I want you
for a war council.
Jets and Sharks.
The pleasure is mine.
Let's go outside.
I would not leave
the ladies here alone
with your kind around.
We will meet you
at midnight.
Doc's candy store?
Mmm-hmm.
And no jazz before then.
I understand the rules...
...native boy.
Ice.
Doc's at midnight.
Spread the word.
Right, daddy-o.
Maria.
The most
beautiful sound I ever heard
MAN:
Maria
All the beautiful
sounds of the world
In a single word
Maria
I just met
a girl named Maria
And suddenly that name
Will never
be the same to me
Mariav
I just kissed a girl
named Maria
And suddenly I've found
How wonderful
a sound can be
Maria
Say it loud,
and there's music playing
Say it soft
And it's almost
like praying
Maria
I'll never stop saying
Maria
Maria, Maria
Maria
Maria, Maria
Say it loud,
and there's music playing
Say it soft
And it's almost
like praying
Maria
I'll never stop saying
Maria
The most beautiful sound
I ever heard
Maria
BERNARDO: Now,
I do not say these things
to spoil your evening...
...or to hear
myself talk.
I am here
longer than you, Maria.
Sí, Nardo.
Someday, when you're
an old married woman
with five kids...
...you can tell me what to do.
But right now it is
the other way around.
Now go to bed.
He's the old married woman.
You know,
she has a mother.
Also a father.
They do not know
this country any better
than she does.
And you do not know it at all.
Girls here are
free to have fun.
She is
in America now.
Puerto Rico
is in America now.
Sometimes I don't
know which is thicker,
your skull or your accent.
Aw...
BERNARDO: Vámonos, muchachos!
Let them wait.
Is Maria all right?
I should be
so all right.
It will not
happen again.
Pepe, Indio, after tonight,
things will be settled.
First settle
your stomach.
Never mind my stomach.
I mind your nose
and your head broken.
Broken?
Sure!
They use Maria for an excuse
to start World War III.
It is more than that.
More than what?
She was only dancing.
With an American
who's really a Polack.
Says the Spic.
ALL: Ooh!
You are not so cute.
That Tony is.
And he works.
A delivery boy.
And what are you?
An assistant.
Sí, and Chino makes half
of what the Polack makes.
Here comes
the whole commercial!
Your mother's a Pole,
your father's a Swede...
But you were born here,
that's all that you need.
You are an American.
But us? Foreigners!
ALL: Lice! Cockroaches!
But it's true!
When I think of how
I thought it would be
for us here...
...we came like
children believing...
Trusting with
our hearts open!
With our arms open.
You came with
your mouth open.
You're the Spic,
and you go back
in handcuffs.
I'm going back
in a Cadillac.
Air-conditioned!
Built-in bar!
Telephone!
And television!
Compatible color.
If you had all that here,
why would you wanna go
back to Puerto Rico?
Or even if you
didn't have
all that here,
why would you
wanna go back there?
It's so good here?
It's so good there?
We had nothing!
We still have nothing,
only more expensive.
Anita Josefina.
ANITA: No.
It's plain Anita now.
Margarita, et cetera.
You leave me alone.
At least I let...
Once an immigrant,
always an immigrant!
Look! Instead of a shampoo,
she's been brainwashed!
Stop it!
She has given up Puerto Rico,
and now she's queer
for Uncle Sam.
No.
That's not true.
Puerto Rico
My heart's devotion
Let it sink
back in the ocean
Always
the hurricanes blowing
Always
the population growing
ALL: Sí!
And the money owing
ALL: That's right.
And the sunlight streaming
And the natives steamingv
I like
the island Manhattanv
I know you do!
Smoke on your pipe
And put that in
ALL: Olé! Olé!
I like to be in America
Okay by me in America
Everything free
in America...
For a small fee
in America
Olé!
Buying on credit
is so nice
One look at us,
and they charge twice
I have my own
washing machine
What will you have,
though, to keep clean
Skyscrapers bloom in America
Cadillacs zoom in America
Industry boom in America
Twelve in a room
in America
Lots of new housing
with more space
Lots of doors
slamming in our face
I'll get a terrace apartment
Better get rid
of your accent
Life can be bright
in America
If you can fight
in America
Life is all right
in America
If you're all-white
in America
La la la la
America
La la la la
America
America
Here you are free,
and you have pride
Long as you stay
on your own side
Free to be anything
you choose
Free to wait tables
and shine shoes
Everywhere grime
in America
Organized crime
in America
Terrible time
in America
You forget
I'm in America
Ooh!
I think I go back
to San Juan
I know a boat
you can get on
Bye-bye!
Everyone there
will give big cheer
Everyone there
will have moved here
Go! Go! Go! Go!
Olé!
BERNARDO: Hey, hey! Hey!
Muchachos.
Vámonos, muchachos.
Es tarde.
Es tarde!
Come on! Chino!
ANITA: What are you doing?
Meet me
on the roof later.
"Meet me
on the roof later."
Will you or won't you?
"Will you
or won't you?"
Will you?
You have your big,
important war council.
The council...
...or me?
First, one...
...and then the other.
No. I'm an
American girl now.
I don't wait.
Back home,
women know their place.
Back home,
little boys don't
have war councils.
But they do here.
You want me
to be an American,
don't you?
Buenas noches,
Anita Josefina Teresita...
...Beatriz del Carmen
Margarita et cetera...
...et cetera, et cetera!
Immigrant!
ALL: Ooh!
Buenas noches!
Buenas noches, Maria!
Adiós, Maria!
ANITA: Good night, Maria!
Good night!
Maria!
- Maria!
- Shh!
Maria!
Quiet.
Come down!
No.
Maria!
Please.
My mother and
father will wake up.
Just for a minute.
A minute
is not enough.
For an hour, then.
I cannot.
- Then forever.
- Shh!
Then I'm coming up.
FATHER: Maria!
Momentito, papá.
Now see
what you've done?
Momentito, Maria.
Cállate.
- Shh!
- Shh!
It is dangerous.
If Bernardo knew...
We will let him know.
I'm not
one of 'em, Maria.
But you are not one of us,
and I am not one of you.
To me,
you're all
the beautiful...
FATHER: Maruca!
Sí, ya vengo, papá.
Maruca?
His pet name
for me.
I like him,
and he will like me.
No.
He's like Bernardo, afraid.
Imagine being
afraid of you!
You see?
I see you.
Maria, see only me.
Only you
You're
the only thing I'll see
Forever
In my eyes,
in my words
And in everything I do
Nothing else but you
Ever
And there's nothing
for me but Maria
Every sight that I see
is Maria
Tony, Tony
Always you
Every thought
I'll ever know
Everywhere I go,
you'll be...
All the world is only
You and me
Tonight, tonight
It all began tonight
I saw you,
and the world went away
Tonight, tonight
There's only you tonight
What you are,
what you do
What you say
Today, all day,
I had the feeling
A miracle would happen
I know now I was right
For here you are
And what was
just a world is a star
Tonight
The world is full of light
With suns and moons
All over the place
Tonight, tonight
The world is wild and bright
Going mad,
shooting sparks into space
Today the world
was just an address
A place for me to live in
No better than all right
But here you are
And what was just a world
is a star
Tonight
FATHER: Maruca!
Es tarde!
I cannot stay.
Go quickly.
I'm not afraid!
Please.
Good night.
Buenas noches.
I love you.
Yes.
Yes. Hurry.
Tony.
When will I see you?
Tomorrow.
I work at the bridal shop
across the street. Madam Lucia's.
I'll come there.
At closing time, 6:00.
Yeah.
Good night.
- Tony.
- Shh!
When you come,
use the back door.
Sí.
Tony.
What does Tony stand for?
Anton.
Te adoro, Anton.
Te adoro, Maria.
Good night
Good night
Sleep well
And when you dream
Dream of me
Tonight
Where the devil
are them Sharks?
Maybe they're
too chicken
to show.
We got time, A-Rab.
Riff and Ice
ain't even here yet.
Come on, come on!
He don't use
a switchblade.
JET 1: What?
He don't even use
an atomic ray gun.
Who don't?
Captain Marvel.
Gee, I love him.
So marry him!
I ain't never gonna
get married. Too noisy.
You ain't never
gonna get married.
Too ugly.
Pow! Pow!
Wacko jacko!
Down goes a teenage hoodlum.
Gee, could a real zip gun
make you do like that?
No, the zip gun
could make you do.
You better wear diapers!
Go walk the streets
like your sister.
Listen, jailbait,
I licked you twice,
and I can do it again!
Come on, Anybodys,
knock it off.
JET 2: Riff's here.
Okay, cats, all present
and accounted for?
I'm really proud of you.
You did good at the dance.
So where are they?
Unwind, Action.
Any sign of Tony?
Invisible, man.
What do you think
the Sharks are gonna ask for?
Mercy.
Just rubber hoses maybe.
Relax, little man.
You tell him, daddy-o.
I'm ready.
Easy. Cool.
Cracko jacko!
Riff, look, in a tight spot,
you're gonna need
every man you can get.
No.
An American tragedy.
Pow!
Poo.
Look, when the Sharks come,
you chicks cut out.
We might, and then again,
we might not.
This ain't kid stuff, Graziella.
I and Velma
ain't kid stuff neither.
Are we, Vel?
No, thank you.
Ooh, obblee-ooh.
And you can punctuate it.
Ooh!
What are we poopin' around
with dumb broads?
I and Velma ain't dumb!
JET 3: The bulls!
KRUPKE: You.
- You!
- Who?
- Who?
Who me?
Top of the evening,
Officer Krupke.
You.
Who, me, sir?
Yeah, you.
Didn't you hear me?
Yes, sir.
I got 20-20 hearing.
Then why didn't
you answer me?
His mother told him
never answer back to a cop.
You little wise apple!
You want me to run you in?
Indeed not, sir.
I oughta run
all youse punks in.
What are ya
standin' around here for,
blockin' the sidewalks?
You see, sir,
we're afraid to go home.
It's such a bad environment.
We don't get no love there.
It's awful.
If you don't leave us
on the streets all night...
...we liable to
turn into a bunch of
juvenile delinquents.
Listen, I know youse guys
was cookin' up
somethin' at the dance.
So don't think you'll put
nothin' over on me.
Sergeant, come on, quick!
We got a 10-13.
Now, go on.
Get a move on,
all of youse.
And don't let me
catch none of youse
around here later.
I'll see you around.
Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey!
You forgot to say good-bye.
Them headbusters
ain't got no manners.
"And don't let me catch
none of youse here later!"
They treat us like
we ain't even human.
He was pretty mad.
So, what happened?
A big fat nothin', right?
Yeah, but suppose
he comes back...
...while we are
havin' the war council?
We'll snow him some more.
See, them cops...
...they believe everything
they read in the papers
about us JDs.
So that's what we give 'em,
somethin' to believe in.
You!
Who, me, Officer Krupke?
Yeah, you! Give me
one good reason...
...for not draggin' you down
to the station house, you punk!
Dear
Kindly Sergeant Krupke
Ya gotta understand
It's just our bringin'-upke
That gets us out of hand
Our mothers all are junkies
Our fathers all are drunks
Golly, Moses
Naturally, we're punks
Gee, Officer Krupke,
we're very upset
We never had the love
that every child oughta get
We ain't no delinquents,
we're misunderstood
Deep down inside us,
there is good
There is good
There is good,
there is good
There is untapped good
Like, inside
the worst of us is good
That's a touchin' good story.
Let me tell it to the world!
Just tell it to the judge.
Who's gonna be the judge?
Dear
Kindly judge, your honor
My parents treat me rough
With all their marijuana
They won't give me a puff
They didn't wanna have me
But somehow I was had
Leapin' lizards!
That's why I'm so bad
Right! Officer Krupke,
you're really a square
This boy don't need a judge
He needs an analyst's care
It's just his neurosis
that ought to be curbed
He's psychologically disturbed
I'm disturbed!
We're disturbed,
we're disturbed
We're the most disturbed
Like, we're
psychologically disturbed
Hear ye! Hear ye!
In the opinion of this court,
this child is depraved...
...on account he ain't had
a normal home.
I'm depraved on account
I'm deprived!
So take him to
a head shrinker. You!
Who, me?
You be the head shrinker.
Oops!
My
Daddy beats my mommy
My mommy clobbers me
My grandpa is a Commie
My grandma pushes tea
My sisterwears a mustache
My brother wears a dress
Goodness gracious!
That's why I'm a mess
Yes, Officer Krupke,
he shouldn't be here
This boy don't need a couch
He needs a useful career
Society's played him
a terrible trick
Und sociologically, he's sick
I am sick!
We are sick,
we are sick
We are sick,
sick, sick
Like, we're sociologically sick
In my opinion,
this child does not
need to have
his head shrunk at all.
Juvenile delinquency
is purely a social disease.
I got a social disease!
So take him to
a social vorker.
Vich vay?
That vay.
Dear
Kindly social worker
They tell me, 'Get a job'
Like, be a soda jerker
Which means like, be a slob
It's not I'm anti-social
I'm only anti-work
Gloriosky!
That's why I'm a jerk
Officer Krupke,
you've done it again
This boy don't need a job
He needs a year in the pen
It ain't just a question
of misunderstood
Deep down inside him,
he's no good!
I'm no good!
We're no good,
we're no good
We're no earthly good
Like, the best of us
is no damn good
The trouble is he's lazy
The trouble is he drinks
The trouble is he's crazy
The trouble is he stinks
The trouble is he's growing
The trouble is he's grown
Krupke, we've got troubles
of our own
Officer Krupke
We're down on our knees
'Cause no one wants a fella
with a social disease
Officer Krupke
What are we to do?
Gee, Officer Krupke
Krup you!
Curfew,
gentlemen and ladies.
Aren't you up
a little late,
Baby John?
I got insomnia, Doc.
Too many worries.
Any of you seen
Tony tonight?
You betcha we did.
DOC: He was supposed to
clean up the store.
Maybe he decided
to clean up
the PRs instead.
Tony?
Doc, you ain't gonna
close up now.
I'm not?
Listen, we got
a war council here.
A who?
To determine weapons.
We gotta set up
a mix with the PRs.
Weapons.
You couldn't play basketball?
Get with it, buster.
You don't understand.
We got special business
comin' here tonight.
Makin' trouble for
the Puerto Ricans?
They make
trouble for us.
For you,
trouble is a relief.
We gotta stand up
to 'em, Doc.
It's important.
Fightin' over
a little piece of street
is so important?
To us, it is!
To hoodlums, it is.
Who you calling hoodlum?
War council...
Don't start, Doc.
Rumbles.
Why, when I was your age...
When you was my age!
When my old man was my age,
my brother was my age...
You was never my age,
none of ya.
And the sooner
you creeps get hip to that,
the sooner you'll dig us!
I'll dig you an early grave,
that's what I'll dig.
Dig, dig, dig!
Okay, Doc, set 'em up.
Cokes all around.
Let's get down
to business.
So, Bernardo hasn't
learned the procedures
of gracious living.
I don't like you,
either, so cut it.
Okay, kick it, Doc.
Boys, couldn't
you maybe talk...
Kick it!
We challenge you to a rumble.
All out, once and for all.
Accept?
On what terms?
Whatever terms
you're callin'.
You crossed the line
once too often.
You started it.
Who jumped Baby John
this afternoon?
Who jumped me
the first day
I moved here?
Who asked you to move here?
Who asked you?
Back where you came from.
Spics.
Mick!
Wop!
We accept.
Time?
Tomorrow?
After dark.
RIFF: Place?
The park?
The river.
Under the highway.
Weapons?
Doc! Doc!
RIFF: Tony!
Weapons!
Weapons.
You call.
Your challenge.
RIFF: Afraid to call?
Rocks.
Belts.
Pipes.
Cans.
Bricks.
Bats.
Clubs.
Chains.
Bottles, knives, guns!
What a coop
full of chickens.
Who are you
callin' chicken?
Every dog
knows his own.
I'm calling
you all chicken!
Big, tough buddy boys
gotta throw bricks.
Afraid to get in close?
Afraid to slug it out?
Afraid to use plain skin?
Not even garbage?
That ain't a rumble.
Who says?
You said call weapons.
A rumble
can be clinched
by a fair fight,
if you've got
the guts to risk that.
Best man from each gang
to slug it out.
I would enjoy
to risk that.
Okay. Fair fight.
Wait a minute!
The commanders
say yes or no.
Fair fight.
When I get through with you,
you will be like
a fish after skinning.
Your best man
fights our best man.
And we pick him.
But I thought I
would be fighting with...
You shook on it.
Yes. I shook on it.
Look, Bernardo,
if you wanna
change your mind...
RIFF: Bernardo, baby,
would you like a cigarette?
No, thank you.
I don't smoke.
Hey.
Evening, Lieutenant.
I and Tony was
just closing up.
Now, this is
more like it, fellas.
Warms me all over
to see you this way.
And after only
a couple of words from me
at the playground.
How about that?
Do you mind?
I have no mind.
I'm the village idiot.
You know, headquarters
hears about this,
I may even get a promotion.
Good deal all around,
Bernardo?
I get a promotion...
...and you Puerto Ricans
get what you've
been itchin' for...
...use of the playground,
use of the gym...
...the streets,
the candy store.
So what if they do
turn this whole town
into a stinkin' pigsty?
Don't stop him!
He wants to get home,
write letters to San Juan...
...tell 'em how
he's got it
made over here!
What I mean is,
clear out, you!
I said, clear out!
Yeah, sure, I know.
It's a free country,
and I ain't got the right.
But I got a badge.
What do you got?
Things are tough all over.
Beat it!
Okay, fellas...
...where's
the rumble gonna be?
Come on!
Regular Americans
don't rub with
the gold teeth unless...
Lieutenant...
You shut your mouth!
Come on, Baby John.
Before that smooth
little kisser of yours
gets cut up for life.
Now, where's it gonna be?
The river?
The park?
Look, fellas,
I'm for you.
I want this beat cleaned up,
and you can do it for me.
I'll even lend a hand
if things get rough.
Now, where you gonna rumble?
The playground?
Sweeney's lot?
Why don't you get smart,
you stupid hooligans?
I ought to take
you to the station and
throw you in the can now!
You and the tinhorn
immigrant scum
you come from!
How's your old man's DTs,
A-Rab?
How's the action
on your mother's side
of the street, Action?
One of these days,
there won't be
anybody to hold you.
Get him out of here!
Come on! Beat it! Go!
Don't worry!
I'll find out
where it's gonna be.
So be sure to
finish each other off,
because if you don't, I will!
Yeah, sure.
Understand them.
That's what they
keep telling me
down at headquarters.
"Understand."
Well, you try
keeping hoodlums in line,
and see what it does to you.
It wouldn't give me
a mouth like his.
Come on, Doc.
Don't let it get you.
I'm sick.
You heard.
It's gonna be
a fair fight.
And that's gonna
cure somethin'?
From here on in,
everything's
gonna be all right.
Got a feelin'.
What have you
been takin' tonight?
A trip to the moon!
And I'll tell you
a secret, Doc.
It ain't a man
that's up there.
It's a girl.
A lady.
Buenas noches, señor.
Buenas noches?
So that's why
you made it a fair fight.
I'm gonna see her tomorrow,
and I can't wait.
Tony!
Things aren't tough enough?
Tough? Doc, I'm in love!
And you're not frightened?
Should I be?
No.
No, I'm frightened enough
for the both of you.
What has Chino
done to her?
Chino? Why Chino?
Maybe she's just
dolling up for us.
Gracias, querida.
Rosalia, Consuelo,
my adorable friends,
can you keep a secret?
I'm hot for secrets.
No. I won't tell you.
What?
"What?"
The poor girl is
out of her mind.
I am! Crazy.
She might be at that.
She looks
somehow different.
I do?
And I think she
is up to something.
I am?
CONSUELO: "I do? I am?"
She talks like a parrot.
ROSALIA: What is
going on with you, Maria?
I feel pretty
Oh, so pretty
I feel pretty
and witty and gay
And I pity
Any girl who isn't me today
I feel charming
Oh, so charming
It's alarming how charming I feel
And so pretty
That I hardly can believe I'm real
See the pretty girl
in that mirror there?
Who can that attractive girl be?
Such a pretty face,
such a pretty dress
Such a pretty smile,
such a pretty me!
I feel stunning
And entrancing
Feel like running
and dancing for joy
For I'm loved
By a pretty wonderful boy
Have you met my good friend Maria?
The craziest girl on the block
You'll know her
the minute you see her
She's the one who is in
an advanced state of shock
She thinks she's in love,
she thinks she's in Spain
La la la
She isn't in love,
she's merely insane
It must be the heat
Or some rare disease
La la la
Or too much to eat
Or maybe it's fleas
Keep away from her
Send for Chino
This is not the Maria we know
Modest and pure,
polite and refined
La la la
Well-bred and mature
And out of her mind
America, Miss America!
Speech!
Miss America,
bravo! Speech!
Speech!
I feel pretty
Oh, so pretty
That the city
should give me its key
A committee
Should be organized
to honor me
La la la la la la
I feel dizzy
I feel sunny
I feel fizzy
and funny and fine
And so pretty
Miss America
can just resign
La la la la la la
See the pretty girl
in that mirror there?
What mirror? Where?
Who can that
attractive girl be?
Which? What? Where? Whom?
Such a pretty face,
such a pretty dress
Such a pretty smile,
such a pretty me
Such a pretty me
I feel stunning
I feel stunning
And entrancing
And entrancing
Feel like running
Feel like running
And dancing for joy
For I'm loved
By a pretty wonderful boy
Cállate!
Por favor, muchachas!
You want to sing,
do it with the needle,
or you'll be out
singing for your supper!
But Madam Lucia,
what can you expect?
We use Singer sewing machines.
Sure.
You make the bad joke home
where I can't hear it.
Go now. Go home.
It's closing time. Shoo!
ALL:
Buenas noches, Madam Lucia.
You put down the shades?
Yes.
Turn off the lights,
and lock the doors.
Buenas noches, Anita.
Buenas noches.
MARIA: Adiós.
The jail is open.
I thought
she'd never leave.
It's hard to believe
that old bag of a witch
was once
a young bag like us.
Let's go before
she changes her mind
and comes back.
You go, querida.
I will lock up.
ANITA: Why?
I have work.
ANITA: Do it tomorrow.
I'm in no hurry.
I am!
I'm going home now
and take a nice,
long bubble bath.
Black orchid.
Black orchid?
All over.
I gotta date with Nardo
after the rumble.
What rumble?
Oh, well, um...
Nardo's Sharks
and those boys
at the dance.
They fight each other tonight?
They don't play patsy.
Why must they always fight?
You saw how they dance,
like they gotta get
rid of something quick.
That's how they fight.
To get rid of what?
Too much feeling.
And they
do get rid of it.
Boy, after a fight,
that brother of yours
is so healthy.
Definitely black orchid.
Buenas noches.
"You go, querida.
I will lock up."
It's too early for noches.
Buenas tardes.
Gracias...
...buenas tardes.
He just came
from the drugstore
to deliver aspirin.
You'll need it.
Not us. We're fine.
We're out of the world.
You're out of your heads.
We're 12 feet in the air.
Anita can see that.
You will not tell?
Tell what?
How can I know
what goes on 12 feet
over my head?
You better be home in 15 minutes.
It's all right.
She likes us.
But she is worried,
and so am I.
That's foolish.
Are you going to
that rumble tonight?
- No.
- Yes!
Why?
You must go and stop it.
I have stopped it.
It'll only be a fistfight
between two of 'em. Nardo...
Any fight is no good for us.
Everything is good for us.
We got magic.
Listen and hear me.
You must go and stop it.
It means that much to you?
Yes.
All right, I will, then.
I believe you.
You do have magic.
Of course.
I've got you.
And tonight,
after I stop the rumble
that isn't a rumble...
...I'll come by for you.
I will wait for you on the roof.
No.
Not the roof.
I'll come to your house.
You cannot. My mama.
Then I'll take you to my house.
Your mama?
She'll come runnin'
from the kitchen
to welcome you.
She lives in the kitchen.
Dressed so elegant?
I told her you were coming.
She'll look at your face.
Try not to smile.
She'll say,
"Skinny, but pretty."
She is plump, no doubt?
Fat.
I take after my mama.
Delicate-boned.
Oh?
Not in front of Mama!
Oh...
I would like to see Papa in this.
Mama will make him
ask about your prospects.
Many.
If you go to church.
Always.
Yes, Papa might like you.
May I have your daughter's hand?
He says, "Yes."
Gracias.
And your mama?
I'm afraid to ask her.
Tell her she's not
getting a daughter.
She's getting rid of a son.
She says, "Yes!"
She has good taste.
Here. Maid of honor.
That color is bad for Anita.
The best man!
That is my papa!
Sorry, Papa.
Here we go, Riff.
Womb to tomb.
Now, you see, Anita?
There was nothing to worry about.
Look! Mama's crying already.
I, Anton...
...take thee, Maria...
I, Maria,
take thee, Anton...
For richer,
for poorer...
In sickness
and in health...
To love
and to honor...
To hold
and to keep...
From each sun
to each moon...
From tomorrow
to tomorrow...
From now to forever...
Till death do us part.
With this ring,
I thee wed.
With this ring...
...I thee wed.
Make of our hands
One hand
Make of our hearts
One heart
Make of our vows
One last vow
Only death
Will part
Us now
Make of our lives
One life
Day after day
One life
Now it begins
Now we start
One hand
One heart
Even death won't part
Us now
The Jets are gonna
have their day tonight
The Jets are gonna
have their way tonight
The Puerto Ricans grumble,
"Fair fight"
But if they start a rumble,
we'll rumble 'em right
We're gonna hand 'em
a surprise tonight
We're gonna cut 'em down
to size tonight
We said,
"Okay, no rumpus, no tricks"
But just in case
they jump us,
we're ready to mix
Tonight!
We're gonna rock it tonight
We're gonna jazz it up
and have us a ball
They're gonna get it tonight
The more they turn it on,
the harder they fall
Well, they began it!
And we're the ones
to stop 'em once and for all
Tonight!
Anita's gonna
get her kicks tonight
We'll have
our private little mix tonight
He'll walk in hot and tired
Poor dear
Don't matter if he's tired
As long as he's here
Tonight, tonight
Won't be just any night
Tonight
there will be no morning star
Tonight, tonight
I'll see my love tonight
And for us
Stars will stop
where they are
Today
the minutes seem like hours
The hours go so slowly
And still the sky is light
Moon, grow bright
And make this endless day
endless night
The Jets are comin' out
on top tonight
We're gonna watch Bernardo
drop tonight
That Puerto Rican punk'll
go down
And when he's hollered uncle
We'll tear up the town
We'll be
in back of you, boy
Right
You're gonna
flatten him good
Right
Tonight
there will be no morning star
Tonight, tonight
We're gonna
jazz it tonight
And for us
stars will shine
We're gonna mix it tonight
Today
the minutes seem like hours
The hours go so slowly
To stop them
once and for all
The Sharks
are gonna have their way
The Jets
are gonna have their day
We're gonna
rock it tonight
Tonight
Ready.
Now, move in
and shake hands.
For what?
That's the way
it's done, buddy boy.
More gracious living?
Look, every one of you
hates every one of us, and
we hate you right back.
Let's get at it.
Sure.
Here we go.
JET 1:
Let's get in there...
JET 2: Come on, Ice.
JET 3: Come on, Ice,
come on!
JET 4: Keep your eyes open!
Hold it!
Tony! Get with the gang.
It's all okay.
No!
Tony, what are you doing?
Maybe he has found the guts
to fight his own battles.
It don't take guts if you got a
battle. We ain't got one. None of us.
- Okay, Nardo?
- Tony!
Hold it!
Now, let's just cool it.
The deal is, a fair fight
between you and Ice.
Come on,
get with the gang.
Mother hen
protecting the little one?
I'll give you a battle.
You've got one!
I'll take pretty boy
as a warm-up.
Afraid, pretty boy?
Afraid, gutless?
- Afraid, chicken?
- Cut it!
No!
I don't wanna, Bernardo.
I'm sure.
- Now, listen to me.
- Are you chicken?
There's no need
to fight.
The hell there ain't!
You've got it wrong!
Chicken!
Why can't you understand?
Understand, chicken!
Get out of here!
Kill him, Tony!
Come on!
Afraid to fight?
Come on.
Let me see you fight.
Chicken boy!
Hey!
He is chicken!
Pretty boy.
Listen to him!
Don't! Stop it!
We got nothin'
to fight about.
Bernardo!
Yellow-bellied chicken!
Don't push me!
Come on,
you yellow-bellied Polack!
TONY: Riff!
What are you doin'?
Get outta here, Tony!
Riff, don't!
Hold him!
Let me go!
Riff, don't!
RIFF: Keep outta this!
TONY: Somebody stop him!
Let me go!
Ice!
Tiger!
Riff!
SHARK 1: Come on, Nardo!
TONY: Stop him!
Riff, don't!
SHARK 2: Nardo!
JET: Get them!
Maria!
Tony, come on!
Come on, Tony!
We gotta get out of here!
Come on!
Come on, Tony!
Come on!
Get outta here!
Come on!
Come on, Tony!
MAN: Hey!
Wait for me, Rosa.
Chino!
There was no one downstairs.
My mother and father
are at the store.
I didn't expect
you to come by.
- I would have waited down...
- Maria.
You have been fighting, Chino?
Yes.
I am sorry.
That is not like you.
No.
You must go home and wash up.
I will see you tomorrow.
Maria, at the rumble...
There was no rumble.
There was.
- No. You are wrong.
- There was.
Nobody meant for it to happen.
Tell me.
It is bad.
Very bad?
You see...
It will be easier
if you say it very fast.
There was a fight.
And Nardo...
Somehow a knife...
And Nardo
and someone, they...
Tony.
What happened to Tony?
Chino, tell me!
Is Tony all right?
He killed your brother!
You are lying.
Chino, why do you lie to me?
Chino, true, you are lying!
Why?
Why do you lie to me, Chino?
CHILD: Mama! Mama!
Bernardo está muerto!
WOMAN: Bernardo, muerto?
No!
Santa María,
make it not be true.
Please make it not be true.
Madre de Dios,
I will do anything.
Make me die!
Only, please,
make it not be true.
Make it not be...
Killer! Killer!
Killer! Killer!
I tried to stop it.
I did try.
I don't know what went wrong.
I didn't mean to hurt him.
I didn't wanna.
But Riff's like my brother...
...when Bernardo killed him,
Bernardo didn't meant it either.
I thought you knew.
I didn't come to tell you that.
Just for you to forgive me,
so I can go to the police.
No!
It'll be easy now.
- I won't let you!
- I must.
Stay! Stay with me.
Maria, I love you so much!
Don't leave me!
Whatever you want, I'll do.
Hold me!
Forever!
Tighter.
It'll be all right. I know it.
We're really together now.
But it's not us.
It's everything around us.
Then I'll take you away,
where nothing can get to us.
Not anyone or anything.
There's a place
For us
Somewhere
A place for us
Peace and quiet
And open air
Wait for us
Somewhere
There's a time
For us
Someday a time for us
Time together
with time to spare
Time to look
Time to care
Someday
Somewhere
We'll find
a new way of living
We'll find
a way of forgiving
Somewhere
There's a place for us
A time and place for us
Hold my hand,
and we're halfway there
Hold my hand
And I'll take you there
Somehow
Someday
Somewhere
Baby John,
what are you doin' here?
Nothin'.
What are you doin'
nothin' here for?
Come on.
I don't want the guys
to see me, A-Rab.
Why not?
I'm cryin'.
You are?
What for?
I don't know.
I'm just...
Blow your nose.
A-Rab?
Yeah?
Did you get
a look at their faces?
Which faces?
You know...
At the rumble.
Riff and Bernardo.
Yeah.
I wish it was yesterday.
Me, too. I'm scared.
Cut it out.
You hear me? Cut it out!
A-Rab, what are we gonna do?
We'll meet
the other guys and form up.
That's what we'll do.
Now, come on.
Let's go.
Hey.
You got a handkerchief first?
What's wrong with your sleeve?
Where you been?
Where do you think,
the Stork Club?
We thought they nabbed you.
Go on.
You didn't see Tony?
Nothin' but coppers.
What's wrong with him?
There's nothin' wrong.
He's okay, you get it?
All right,
all right!
Maybe we oughta go home.
For what?
- Betcha they got him.
- Not Tony.
Man, he was great,
right, Baby John?
Yeah.
He really come through
for the Jets.
Just like Riff said he...
Said he would.
I want Riff!
Come on, Graziella.
Nobody was
supposed to get killed.
It just...
They're gonna pay!
Them stinkin' Sharks.
Dirty fighting.
They started it!
So why don't we finish it?
We gotta show 'em who's on top.
The Jets!
Let's do it now!
Ain't we had enough?
What's the matter, you scared?
Who you callin' scared?
Lay off of him.
Mind your own business.
Don't sound off
on me. I'll...
You'll do what?
Knock it off!
Shut up down there,
you dirty bunch
of good-for-nothings!
Go home where you belong!
Who you callin'
good-for-nothin',
you loudmouth crud head?
Come down, I'll put
this through your face!
Get inside!
All of you!
Come on!
ICE: Shut up!
I don't have to
take that from nobody!
Next creep who sounds on me,
I swear the next guy...
You'll laugh!
Yeah.
Now, you all better
dig this and dig it good!
No matter who
or what is eatin' you...
...man, you show it,
and you are dead!
You are cuttin'
a hole in yourselves
for them to stick in
a red-hot umbrella...
...and open it wide!
Man, you wanna
get past the cops
when they start
askin' about tonight?
You play it cool.
You wanna live in
this lousy world?
Play it cool.
- I wanna get even!
- Get cool!
- I wanna bust!
- Bust cool!
- I wanna go!
- Go cool!
Boy, boy, crazy boy
Get cool, boy
Got a rocket
In your pocket
Keep cooly cool, boy
Don't get hot
'Cause, man,
you've got some
high times ahead
Take it slow, and daddy-o
You can live it up
and die in bed
Boy, boy, crazy boy
Stay loose, boy
Breeze it, buzz it,
easy does it
Turn off the juice, boy
Go, man, go
But not like
a yo-yo schoolboy
Just play it cool, boy
Real cool...
Easy, Action!
ALL: Shh!
Cool it, A-Rab,
cool it!
Go, cool!
Pow!
Go!
Cool!
Pow!
Cool!
Go!
Crazy!
Cool!
Go!
Crazy!
Go!
Boy, boy, crazy boy
Stay loose, boy
Breeze it, buzz it,
easy does it
Turn off the juice, boy
Just play it cool, boy
Real cool
Okay.
Let's go.
Bop!
Pow!
Where we goin'?
If we lay low, the coppers
are gonna smell fish.
So the first thing
we do...
ANYBODYS: Buddy boy!
Go wear a skirt.
I got scabby knees.
Listen...
First, start showing around
like we got nothin' to hide.
Suppose they ask
us about the rumble.
Supposin' they ask you
where's Tony
and what party's
lookin' for him
with a gun!
ICE: You know somethin'?
I know I gotta
go get a skirt.
Come on, Anybodys!
- What's the freak know?
- Plenty!
I figured somebody
oughta infiltrate
PR territory...
...and spy around.
I'm very large
with shadows, you know.
I can slip in and out of 'em
like wind through a fence.
Boy, is she ever
makin' the most of it.
You bet
your fat "A," I am!
- Spill it!
- Okay.
I hear Chino tellin'
the Sharks somethin'
about Tony
and Bernardo's sister.
And then I hear Chino say,
"If it's the last thing I do,
I'm gonna get that Polack."
And then he pulls out
the bad news!
BABY JOHN: Gee!
Them PRs won't stop.
Till we stop 'em.
Hold it!
Now, listen...
...Tony come through for us.
We gotta come through for Tony.
We gotta find him
before Chino finds him.
And burns him.
You cover the river!
Snowboy, get over to Doc's.
I'll take the alleys.
We'll take the streets.
The park.
The schoolyard.
We'll take the playground.
What about me?
You?
In and out
of the shadows.
Maybe you'll find
Tony in one of them.
Right!
Hey!
You done good,
buddy boy.
Thanks, daddy-o.
Who is...
Maria.
Maria?
Maria, it's Anita.
You in there?
- Maria?
- Yes.
Open the door.
I need you.
No.
Now you are afraid, too?
What?
I'll be right there.
Together.
But where?
The bus station.
We'll go so far away,
they'll never find us.
How can we?
Doc will help us.
I'll get money from him.
You'll meet me at his store.
At Doc's, yes.
- I'll wait for you there.
- All right.
ANITA: Maria!
Yes.
Hurry!
Maria!
Coming, Anita.
Anita.
Oh...
All right, now you know.
And you still don't know.
He is one of them!
No, Anita!
Yes!
A boy like that
Would kill your brother
Forget that boy
and find another
One of your own kind
Stick to your own kind
A boy like that
will give you sorrow
You'll meet
another boy tomorrow
One of your own kind
Stick to your own kind
A boy who kills
cannot love
A boy who kills
has no heart
And he's the boy
who gets your love
And gets your heart
Very smart, Maria,
very smart
A boy like that
wants one thing only
And when he's done,
he'll leave you lonely
He'll murder
your love
He murdered mine
Just wait and see
Just wait, Maria
Just wait and see
No, Anita, no
Anita, no
It isn't true, not for me
It's true for you,
not for me
I hear your words
And in my head,
I know they're smart
But my heart, Anita
But my heart
Knows they're wrong
You should know better
You were in love
Or so you said
You should know better
I have a love
And it's all
that I have
Right or wrong
What else can I do?
I love him
I'm his
And everything he is
I am, too
I have a love
And it's all
that I need
Right or wrong
And he needs me, too
I love him
We're one
There's nothing
to be done
Not a thing I can do
But hold him
Hold him forever
Be with him now
Tomorrow
And all
Of my life
When love comes
So strong
There is no right or wrong
Your love is
Your life
Chino has a gun.
I heard the boys talking.
He's hunting for Tony.
He is at Doc's store,
waiting for me.
If Chino hurts him,
if he touches him,
I swear to you, I'll...
You'll do what
Tony did to Bernardo.
I love Tony.
I know.
I loved Bernardo.
SCHRANK: Anybody home?
Yes.
Bernardo's sister, please.
She isn't feeling well.
Who is?
Hello, miss.
I'm Lt. Schrank. I don't like to
disturb you at a time like this...
Yes, a very bad time.
You'll excuse me, please.
I have a couple of
questions to ask.
Afterwards, please.
I must go to my brother now.
Now, just one minute!
- Can't you wait?
- No!
Now.
You were at
the dance last night...
Will this take very long?
As long as it has to.
Excuse me.
Anita, my headache is much worse.
Will you go to
Doc's store for me?
Don't you people
keep aspirin around?
This is something special.
Will you go for me, Anita?
What shall I ask for?
Doc will know.
Tell him I have been detained and
can't get there right away...
...or I would have
picked it up myself.
Excuse me.
You were asking?
Yeah.
At the gym last night,
your brother got
into a heavy argument...
...because you danced
with the wrong boy.
Yes.
Who was the boy?
Another from my country.
And his name?
José.
ACTION: Can't find him.
He ain't nowhere.
He's down there
in the cellar.
- Tony?
- Safe and sound.
I found him.
You warn him about Chino?
What's he doin' in the cellar?
Keepin' the mice company, stupid.
No sign of Chino?
Nothin'.
His luck.
I'll slip out back and
check the alleys again.
You guys hang here.
Right.
BABY JOHN: Boy,
I'm thirsty. Where's Doc?
Upstairs raising
getaway money for Tony.
Doc ain't got no money.
His mattress has.
Come on. Cut the frabberjabber.
Grab some readin' matter.
Play the juke.
Some of you get outside.
If you see Chino
or those stinkin' PRs comin...
I'd like to see Doc.
He ain't here.
Where is he?
He went to the bank.
They made a mistake
in his favor.
The banks are closed at night.
Where is he?
You know how skinny Doc is.
He slipped in through
the night-deposit slot.
And got stuck halfway in.
Which indicates there's no tellin'
when he'll be back.
Buenas noches, señorita.
Where you goin'?
Downstairs.
Didn't I tell you he ain't here?
I'd like to see for myself.
Please.
Por favor.
Will you let me pass?
She's too dark to pass.
- Don't.
- Please don't.
Por favor.
No comprende.
Gracias.
De nada.
Mambo!
Listen, you!
We're listenin'.
Look, I gotta
give a friend of yours
a message.
He ain't here.
I gotta tell Tony...
- I know he is.
- Who says he is?
- Who's the message from?
- Never mind.
Couldn't be from Chino,
could it?
Don't you understand?
I want to help!
Bernardo's girl wants to help?
Even a greaseball's got feelings.
But she wants to help get Tony.
No!
Not much.
Bernardo's tramp.
Bernardo's pig!
- You lyin' Spic!
- Don't do that.
Gold tooth!
Pierced ear!
Don't.
Garlic mouth.
I want to help!
Come on!
Go!
Chiquita!
ANITA: No!
Olé! Olé!
Hey, babe!
Come on!
Let's get her!
No, you don't.
Come on, baby.
Come on!
DOC: Stop it!
What are you doing there?
Bernardo was right.
If one of you...
...was lying in
the street bleeding...
...I'd walk by
and spit on you!
She'll tell Chino that
Tony's in the cellar.
Don't you touch me!
I got a message
for your American buddy.
You tell that murderer that
Maria's never going to meet him!
You tell him that Chino found
out about them...
...and shot her!
She's dead!
When do you kids stop?
You make this world lousy!
We didn't make it, Doc.
Get outta here!
Maria?
Doc, I thought I heard...
You got it!
Yes, I got it.
Doc, you're a pal.
You're the best friend
a guy ever had.
I'll pay you back as soon as I can.
I promise.
Forget that.
No, I'll never!
I couldn't.
Doc, you know what we're gonna
do in the country, Maria and me?
We'll have kids, and we'll
name 'em all after you...
...even the girls,
so when you visit us...
Wake up!
Is this the only way
to get through to you...
...do just what you all do,
bust like a hot water pipe?
What's got into you?
Why do you kids live
like there's a war on?
Why do you kill?
I told you how it happened.
Maria understands.
I thought you did, too.
Maria understands nothing...
Never again.
There is no Maria, Tony.
What?
I can't.
No, no, Doc.
Now, tell me.
What is it?
That was Anita upstairs.
Chino found out
about you and Maria...
...and he killed her.
No.
Maria.
Not Maria, Doc.
She's...
Chino!
Come and get me, too, Chino!
Chino!
Come and get me, too!
Tony!
Who's that?
It's me, Anybodys.
Come on.
Get out of here!
Chino, come and get me,
damn you!
What are you doin'?
Get out of here! Chino!
Why don't you come with me?
We'll find...
It ain't playin' anymore!
Can't any of you get that?
But the gang...
You're a girl!
Be a girl and beat it!
Chino!
Come on, Chino!
Get me, too!
Chino!
I'm callin' for you, Chino!
There's nobody here but me.
Come on!
Please, will you?
I'm waitin' for you.
I want you to.
Maria.
Tony!
Maria.
Maria!
I...
I didn't believe hard enough.
Loving is enough.
Not here.
They won't let us be.
Then we'll get away.
Yeah.
- We can.
- Yes.
- We will.
- Yes.
Hold my hand
And we're halfway there
Hold my hand
And I'll take you there
Somehow
Someday
Some...
MARIA: Stay back!
How do you fire
this gun, Chino?
Just by pulling
this little trigger?
How many bullets
are left, Chino?
Enough for you?
And you?
All of you!
You all killed him,
and my brother, and Riff...
...not with bullets
and guns.
With hate!
I can kill, too,
because now I have hate!
How many can I kill, Chino?
How many?
And still have one bullet
left for me?
No!
Don't you touch him!
Te adoro, Anton.
