MARSHLAND
SEPTEMBER 20TH, 1980
We thought you weren't coming.
Our car broke down.
We gave one of the rooms away.
You'll have to share a room tonight.
- Upstairs on the right.
- Thanks.
Your new country.
We'll grab dinner and go to bed.
We want to start first thing.
Yeah, I miss you. A lot.
How are you'?
Have you been throwing up'?
Sure.
I have to go.
We'll talk tomorrow.
Estrella's the eldest, she's 17.
Carmen is 15, I think.
Sixteen.
- Hey.
Excuse me.
- Where were they seen last'?
- At the edge of town.
Their father runs the ferry
at the Point.
They live a couple miles
down the road.
They were walking home.
A neighbor saw them get in a car.
She's the last one who saw them.
- What kind of car?
- A Citroén.
Model'?
A Dyane 6 or a 2CV.
The lady isn't sure.
How long ago was that?
- Three days.
- Nice marinade. What fish is it?
Striped mullet.
Never tried it.
Very tasty.
Is this the first time
they've gone missing?
No. They have a reputation.
But they were always home
by bedtime.
What for?
A reputation. You know.
No, I don't.
They like to have a good time.
You don't'?
A reputation for being easy.
Give me another ten.
Bad time to pick on the military.
What that fascist said
is antidemocratic.
All I did was write a letter
to the paper. That's not a crime.
This country isn't a democracy.
They're not used to it.
You can't criticize a general
and expect a pat on the back.
The military still has power.
So what do we do'?
Leave it like it was?
Look where it got you.
- Yeah, with you.
- No.
I'm not the cop with a future
in Madrid.
For me this isn't a punishment.
I don't want to be a hero.
You'd rather extort money
from hookers and bars.
Who told you that?
- I have a good ear.
- What else have you heard?
That's not enough for you'?
A bottle of sweet wine
and two glasses.
No, one.
Good night.
What are they drinking?
- Gin.
- Gin?
Give them another round.
Is this enough?
Plenty.
And a donut or some churros.
Keep them lucid.
And for you?
Another beer.
I'd better not mix anymore.
Well, okay.
Give me both.
- What time is it'?
- Late.
Get up. They gave us a car
while they fix ours.
FAIR WAGES
I heard last night
the girls wanted to leave town.
People talk a lot when they drink.
And go where'?
Anywhere.
Their father wasn't very happy
with them.
Give these gentlemen some wine.
Say when.
When.
- For you?
- No, thank you.
Smells good. What is it?
River crabs.
Spicy?
So what now?
Which is their bedroom?
May I?“
WELCOME TO THE LABOR MARKET
Any idea where they may have gone?
Did you argue about anything?
Notice anything missing?
A bankbook, for their savings account.
And clothing.
Do you know why your daughters
wanted to leave?
My daughters didn't want
to go anywhere.
Did anyone want to hurt them'?
- Any money, anything valuable?
- Do you know why you're here?
- To find your daughters.
- No one gives a shit about them.
You're here because her cousin
served with Judge Andrade.
So skip the song and dance
and just find them.
Lunch.
I'm coming.
I found it in the brazier.
Please don't tell my husband.
If he finds out he'll kill them.
They've already brought him
enough shame.
- Were they with anyone'?
- They were alone.
Did you talk to them'?
They were far away.
We were with them after that.
Where?
At the bumper cars for a while,
then we went home.
- What time was it?
- Midnight.
I know because we had to go.
- Where did you leave them?
- On the road.
At the edge of town.
- Did they have boyfriends?
- No.
Is it true they wanted to leave town?
- Who doesn't?
- I don't.
- You're lame.
- And you're jealous.
Okay.
Did they ever say where?
Anywhere is better than this.
Any friends with a white car,
a Citrfiien?
No.
It's Quini.
What'?
Her boyfriend is outside.
Can we go now'?
You can leave.
- Your son?
- The youngest. He's in Germany.
He's been working there for two years.
I have two more in Barcelona
and my daughter's in France.
Can you tell me what you saw?
On the bend.
That's where it stopped.
Did you see how many people
were in the car?
No.
Were they forced into the car?
I think they knew each other.
Because they were laughing.
I drew a sketch for you.
This one is a 20V,
with round headlights on the hood.
And the Dyane 6
has them built in.
It was more like this one.
The Dyane 6.
- Who are they?
- Pickers.
Here for the harvest.
He's from the town.
They know him.
Could be a picker
who comes every year.
Or someone who works
at the fair.
The father has a Dyane 6.
Yellow.
It was parked outside the house.
Yellow looks like white at night.
- And gray. It's a common car.
- Excuse me.
Someone wants to talk to you.
Angelita is psychic,
she sees stuff.
She talks to the dead in her sleep.
She asks them what she wants to know
and the dead tell her.
Have a seat.
I've been talking to my dead mother
the last two nights
and she said
she saw the girls
at the abandoned farmhouse.
Something wrong?
Nothing.
LONG LIVE FRANCO
VICTORY WAS OURS AND ALWAYS WILL BE
Pedro!
Over here!
What's up?
I'll get the car.
I'll see if I can reach it.
I'm almost touching the water.
Careful!
Are you okay'?
I got it, pull me up!
Estrella was wearing hose
like those.
Freeze!
Stop!
Why are you running?
- I don't have a permit.
- What is that?
A baby deer?
Roebuck.
Where are you from?
The town.
Get up.
What's your name?
Jesus.
You and I met the other night
at the fair, remember?
My head still hurts from the gin.
How did you get here'?
I walked.
It's a long walk.
Not if you know the trails.
See anyone go in or out
of the farmhouse?
I don't like that place.
Nothing but ghosts around.
Can I go?
How much do you get for Bambi?
Don't sell it, you owe us.
So find someone who knows
how to cook it.
Son of a bitch!
Get out of here
or I'll peg you in the head!
Find anything?
No, nothing.
In the well'?
Garbage.
Tie up the geese,
I need to take a leak.
- Ab"elardo!
Abelardo, come here!
Carmen.
Estrellla.
Go back to the car,
I forgot my notebook.
- Where was that?
- Back there.
Then why are you putting it here?
- With the other stuff.
- What stuff?
The pile. All together
so nothing gets lost.
I'll put it back if you want.
No, leave it there.
Don't touch anything else.
Write this down.
Apart from the breasts...
Several cuts, apparently stab wounds.
First degree burn on the left hand.
Let's move to the other body.
Write down that she has cuts
across her neck, abdomen and thorax.
Three fingers cut off
on her left hand.
Signs of vaginal injury.
She was probably raped
like her sister.
Help me turn her over.
She was forced from behind too.
They have been in the water
for two days.
- Where does this road lead?
- To the river.
What are those photos for'?
El Caso.
- How did you find out'?
- I got a call.
- Who?
- I don't know.
Get out of here.
Weren't you listening?
Get the hell out of here!
I'm leaving, I'm leaving!
Go on.
Handle this discreetly and solve it
as soon as possible.
I promise you'll be rewarded.
The harvest begins soon
and we can't lose it.
We already have enough problems
with the strike.
Your ticket back to Madrid.
They weren't killed here,
there's no blood.
Someone drove them here
and dumped them.
The tire tracks double back.
He changed his mind
and turned around.
Maybe he saw someone and got nervous.
Someone has to tell the parents.
You're from here, they know you.
You guys do it.
We have to see them every day.
I'll do it.
Let's get a drink.
Thanks.
Excuse me.
This came for you earlier.
And your wife called.
She said to call her back.
What's wrong?
A guy wants to see you.
He's drunk and he has a shotgun.
Who are you guys?
We're police.
We heard you wanted to see us.
Put down the shotgun.
No, you guys aren't cops.
We don't sleep in uniform.
Put that down.
Wanna see my badge?
Stay back.
I'll show you my badge
and you put down the shotgun.
It's not loaded.
I only wanted to talk.
I'm sorry.
Beatriz was my girlfriend.
He killed her.
He killed Adela too.
He chops them up
and dumps them in the river.
That's why they only found the foot.
What foot?
It was her shoe.
I gave it to her.
She said she was coming back.
Back from where?
The Costa del Sol.
She found a job there.
She loved me.
Nobody commits suicide
with a suitcase.
What suitcase'?
Hers.
They found it floating
in the river.
Castro.
Who was it?
I don't know.
We got back to the hotel late.
I didn't want to wake you.
Late means late.
What do I do if there's no phone,
paint one?
I'm working, don't start.
I am calm. You're the one who isn't.
Good morning.
I'm sorry.
- Morning.
- Morning.
I'm not hungry.
The girls' autopsy just came.
Estrella's pantyhose had semen on them.
Blood type AB.
I talked to Miguel.
I asked him for a list
of all the Dyane 6's in the area.
When did you talk to him?
Early.
You never sleep?
- Sure I do.
- When?
When you do, that's why
you never see me.
The forensic said
it was a boat propeller.
Nobody in her family knew
she was leaving town to work.
The girls had one just like it.
JOB OPPORTUNITIES FOR WOMEN
These places aren't on the map.
We don't know where they are.
- What's in it for me?
- What do you want?
What size are those?
Size big.
These places are hard to find.
Almost 500 pesetas.
Five hundred.
And the smokes.
For the ride.
I told you, nobody lives there.
It's abandoned.
Want me to open it?
Looks like they left in a hurry.
They left when they found out
their daughter had drowned.
They couldn't set foot
in the house after that.
You know them'?
Beatriz, Estrella and Carmen.
Charlie's Angels.
The one in the middle is Quini.
Hi.
Hi.
His mother disappeared
three years ago.
My husband gave her this cross.
She never took it off.
My Adela said it was good luck.
I have something to show you.
Did you notice anything strange
before she left?
My granddaughter was very sad
when Quini left her.
Quini'?
Quini, from Villa-Franco.
The good-looking one.
She didn't say where she was going'?
To find work. She said
she'd come back for us after.
These books are hers.
She was going to night school
to get her diploma.
- Can we take these?
- Please don't lose them.
Thank you.
Thanks.
Who are you'?
What the fuck do you want?
Okay, okay!
You, stay put.
Did you know Carmen and Estrella?
Everyone did.
What was your relationship?
You already know.
I dated Carmen for a couple months.
A little young, no?
Young for what?
Did you take photos of her?
Do I look like a photographer?
Want me to hit you again?
Where were you
the night they disappeared?
September 17th, six days ago.
Where?
With a friend.
Blonde, long hair, 16 years old?
- Is that how you like them?
- Motherfucker!
IStop, stop, stop!
Okay, okay.
Where were you?
You already know, I was with Marina
the whole time.
How do you know her?
I don't.
And this one?
Nope.
Why are you in the photo?
Must have met her that night.
Can I go now'?
Get out.
That's my knife.
Take it.
They're all the same age.
"Very young-
Adela disappeared
on September 14th,
Beatriz the 15th,
Carmen and Estrella the 17th.
In '77, '78 and '80.
During the fair.
- The town is busier.
- People drink more,
it takes longer to notice
someone missing,
more people meet...
It could be an outsider,
but they all knew Quini.
And they all wanted to leave.
Did you see his hand?
Triangle tattoo.
Like in the photo.
Boss.
What's her name'?
The one in green.
Macarena.
Give her this and another round.
It's strange.
What is?
He's good-looking,
he could have any girl.
Why does he do it?
You look tired.
You should go to bed.
Take the car, I don't mind.
I'll walk back.
Wednesday morning
- Evening.
- Evening.
Um' 'Q  \ I “Q, 1
I'm alone.
- Can I come in?
- Yeah, sure.
Just a moment.
What can you tell me about this?
That she has nice tits.
It's Carmen, she's dead.
She had nice tits.
- What can I tell you?
- Whatever you know.
Where did you get it'?
That's not your concern.
- I'm a journalist.
- Don't make me laugh.
Send it to Madrid.
- See what they say.
- I don't have time.
What do you want?
Something I don't know.
They were tortured.
Were they raped?
I read your letter in the paper.
I liked it.
If you catch me younger,
I make you a hero.
It's a very rare film.
Not a common brand.
Imported.
I don't think many people
around here use a roll like that.
I can find out who does.
But I want the photos
of their cadavers.
From the autopsy.
I have a family. I have to put
food on the table.
Does your family know what you do'?
My family thinks
I'm the next Truman Capote.
He's an American writer.
Never mind.
Find out.
I've seen your partner too,
but I don't remember where.
Do you know if he ever worked
in Vallecas?
- I'm sorry.
- Thank you.
I'm sorry.
I found my daughters' bankbook.
My husband had it hidden
in the car.
We found this in the glove
compartment of your car.
What's going on, Rodrigo?
I owe a lot of money.
I can't pay him.
Pay who'?
A loan shark.
Why'?
Because I wanted to get
my family out of here.
I didn't want my daughters
in this town anymore.
You borrowed money
for your daughters?
Stgp...
What's wrong with you?
What is it?
What's wrong?
Two months ago I found a brick.
At the Point.
A brick of what?
Tobacco?
Heroin.
You know what that is'?
How much did it weigh?
One kilo.
What did you do with it?
I sold it.
What did you do with the money?
I spent it.
On what?
The car outside.
Do you think that's why
they killed your daughters?
I don't know.
They came here for their money.
They took the washing machine,
the fridge, the television...
If I don't pay, they'll take
the car and the boat.
We'll have to move away.
We need to talk to the Civil Guard.
Have them step up surveillance
at the Point.
We have to find
whoever owns that heroin.
I'll take the river.
I'll take Quini.
HUNTING LODGE FOR RENT
Yes.
Okay, thanks a lot.
Marina's at her house.
Her mother says she's fine.
The Civil Guard is mixed up
in all of this.
Someone's tipping them off.
The whole town smokes
American tobacco
and there's not a single butt
on any of the boats.
They have to get by on something
between harvests.
Go in.
Sit there.
I'm fine standing.
Sit, damn it.
What were you doing
at the hunting lodge earlier?
I was with my girlfriend.
Wanna hear the details?
Yes, I do.
Nobody ever explained it to you?
Who's the man in the hat?
What man'?
The guy who went in after you,
before I got my head bashed in.
Nobody came in.
I told you, we were alone.
You want my blood, is that it?
Call the doctor, I'll wait.
Too bad you didn't bring
your pajamas. You're sleeping here.
...Including Lora del Rio
and other towns.
The situation
is becoming very serious.
Similar incidents are taking place
as they had
in recent years
in the Andalusian countryside.
Damn!
Are you okay'?
These are Joaquin Varela's
blood test results. Quini.
His blood type doesn't match
the one we're looking for.
I remind you this is a democracy.
Next time you want to arrest
someone, you ask me first.
This country isn't what it was.
The harvest is soon
and people are nervous.
Please don't waste any more time.
Good day.
You're not going to school today'?
I'm sick.
My stomach hurts.
What did you do
yesterday afternoon?
I went to a movie.
With who'?
With some friends.
What friends?
One moment, I'll be right back.
Who were you with yesterday
at the hunting lodge?
Who was the man in the hat,
Marina?
What man'?
Aren't you a little hot
in that sweater?
I'm sick.
How did you hurt yourself?
- What'?
- You r wrist.
My watch gives me a rash.
Cut the nonsense.
Who was the man in the hat?
I don't know who you mean.
- Where's Quini?
- I don't know.
You're sick
and he hasn't come to visit?
- I didn't tell him.
- Why don't you call him?
Mom!
Marina, look at me.
Does your morn know
what you do at the lodge?
Mom!
Tell us who the man is
or we'll tell her.
Mom!
What is it?
I don't feel well.
My stomach hurts.
I'm going to throw up.
Honey, what's wrong'?
Don't worry, ma'am.
We were just leaving.
- Thanks for the coffee.
- You're welcome.
Marina'?
- What are you doing?
- Did you believe a word she said?
Me neither. She's scared
and I'm going to find out why.
There are five bedrooms,
each with several beds.
I have extra beds
if there are more of you.
There's room outside for the dogs.
There's water, electricity...
Anyway...
All the comforts.
- Can I have a look?
- Yes.
Do you know the area?
Is the house yours'?
I wish.
We have fans available
if you need them.
Whose house is it'?
The owner lives in Valencia.
She hasn't come in years,
she's very old...
- Who rented it last'?
- I don't remember.
It's been closed for a long time.
It's the off season.
I was here yesterday and I saw
three people enter the house.
Nice, very pretty.
You're hurting me!
I asked you a question.
Who was here yesterday?
I don't know who rents it.
You rent it
and you don't know to who?
I rent it to him by the day.
He calls me right before
and puts the money in an account.
Lower your voice.
Who's the man in the hat?
Who is he'?
I don't know anything.
I get paid not to meddle.
What are you doing'?
What's going on here'?
Nothing. These gentlemen came to see
the house. They were just leaving.
Good afternoon.
- Who is that? Do you know him?
- The watchman?
Never seen him in my life.
Take a stroll, Jesus.
Drive. I'll tell you where to go.
Go inside.
Go on.
Have a seat.
Eugenio.
Give them something to drink,
it's hot.
The heroin Rodrigo found was mine,
but he didn't find it,
he stole it.
But I didn't kill anyone.
That's Fermin over there.
Angelita is his wife.
You've already met.
She's not psychic.
Fermin was at the farmhouse
the night the girls were killed.
He knows more than what was
in the well. But there's a price.
What do you want?
Withdraw the Civil Guard
from the Point.
Okay or not?
- Okay.
- Tell them, Fermin.
I saw the man who threw the bag
in the well.
What did he look like'?
I didn't see his face,
it was too dark.
But he was normal,
a normal person.
It was the same day
the girls disappeared.
I was at the farmhouse
waiting for a brick.
It was five in the morning.
What kind of car was it?
A white Dyane 6.
He drove right past me.
The car had a sticker
on the back window.
What kind of sticker?
A woman with long hair
and a hat.
How long? This long'?
A little shorter.
What was the hat like?
Big. Like a priest.
Like this?
I've seen this before somewhere.
Anything else, Fermin?
That's what I saw.
Hey.
I did see your problem.
The dead are waiting for you.
It's almost time.
He gave her these towels.
They were from the hotel
where he worked in Malaga.
- What was her friend's name?
- Sebastian.
Sebastian what'?
- I don't know.
- Is he from around here?
I don't know.
- Have you ever seen him'?
- Never.
- What else did she say'?
- That he was nice to her.
That he helped her
get over Quini.
Thank you.
Bye, buddy.
Goodbye.
His name is Sebastian Rovira Galvez.
He doesn't work at the hotel
anymore. He got fired.
They still have some
of his things there.
We need to get them.
MOTHER WITH FRIEND
TOMORROW AT 7:30 AT THE CROSS.
GO ALONE.
The photos of the girls were taken
with a roll like that one.
- Only one place sells them.
- Where?
Where are my photos?
I don't have them yet.
And what do you have?
Aguila Photography, in Seville.
Someone places a prepaid order
every month.
Who?
A good-looking guy named Quini.
They develop them there too,
but they wouldn't tell me about them.
But definitely not communion photos.
I think there's someone else there.
You can see the reflection
of whoever took the photo.
He's blurred by the flash.
Tell me who he is
and you'll get your photos.
All right, but I'll need the negative.
Otherwise it's impossible.
I won't use it.
You can trust me.
Would you trust someone like you?
You have my word.
Can he sleep at night?
Your partner.
I remembered.
He was in
the Social-Political Brigade.
You know, Franco's Gestapo.
He killed a girl at a protest
in Vallecas in '71.
Shot her twice.
He's aged badly.
And I'm glad.
M-Hello
- How are you'?
That's Marina.
She and my daughters
were close friends.
Quini took her to the hunting lodge
the other day.
After they were together
he asked her not to get dressed
and he tied her to the bed.
Then he left the room
and came back with another man.
Who was he'?
She didn't see his face.
All she knows is he smelled good,
like expensive cologne.
And that he had very soft hands.
He took photographs of her.
Quini threatened to show them
to everyone in town
if she told anyone.
The night my daughters were killed...
Marina was with Quini,
but not the whole night.
Do you think she'd be able
to tell a judge?
She couldn't even tell you.
I have to go.
Good afternoon.
I'm Pedro Suarez.
- The manager is expecting me.
- One moment, please.
ACCESS PROHIBITED TO NON-EMPLOYEES
It's this suitcase.
- Shall I open it'?
- Yes, open it.
The guy was really weird.
He had a problem with a guest.
What problem?
Something weird
with a very young girl.
I think that's why he vanished
all of a sudden. Poof...
...and he was gone.
Rovira Galvez, Sebastian.
Sexual assault on a minor'?
Whereabouts unknown...
A two-year-old warrant for his arrest...
Anything else?
Any friends who know him?
No, he has no family.
Nobody in his town
ever saw him again.
He didn't even go
to his mother's funeral.
Yeah, yeah.
Thank you very much.
The wages are nothing!
It's not enough to survive on!
You should know
we're going through rough times.
Mr. Alfonso is offering
That's nothing!
Silence, please!
That's his final offer.
Anyone who doesn't want to work
can stay home.
We've too many people already.
If you want to sign up,
get in line.
Sir!
Hey!
Hey!
Excuse me.
Juan Robles. I just wanted
to introduce myself.
Alfonso Corrales.
I'm with the police.
I'm here about the murders.
If I can be of any help...
Let me know if you need anything.
See you around.
Thank you.
Yes.
Yes, don't worry.
Of course.
Good night, Manuel.
And thanks.
there's no Dyane 6
on the Corrales property,
neither registered or unregistered.
And Marina's mother says
her daughter is at a movie.
I'll call Mr. Corrales tomorrow
and have him come in for a blood test.
- It's late for today.
-It's 11 o'clock.
- I don't think it's late.
call him tomorrow morning.
I don't think there will be
any problem.
Right now I'm going to have them
check on the girl.
I'm not asking you
to call him on the telephone.
I'm asking you to authorize
a blood test.
Right now.
And I also want authorization
to question Corrales and Quini together.
I heard you were a troublemaker.
What did you say?
All you have is literature.
Your partner saw a man in a hat.
Nothing more.
Isn't that right?
That's right.
I wear a hat too.
Does that make me a suspect too?
I won't authorize anything until
you bring me something conclusive.
Now please leave.
I'll call you when I hear back.
You're protecting him.
What'?
You don't know how things
work around here.
Yes, I do.
Just like everywhere else.
You're going to be a father.
You should be more careful
about what you do.
Get out.
Why didn't you say anything?
Whose side are you on?
Are you with them too?
I just want to solve this case.
I don't want to be taken off it.
You're just like the rest of them.
You'd rather things were like before.
I know what you used to do.
I know about Vallecas.
You don't know anything.
Nothing!
Be careful who you get your
information from.
- That guy is out for blood.
- Let me go.
It was an accident.
And it wasn't me.
It was my partner.
I didn't even draw my weapon.
If you killed someone,
I'd cover for you too. Is that wrong?
Let's go to Marina's house.
No, how could he be the father?
He's 87 years old!
Tell them I'll do anything,
I don't care.
I wanted to know
what's happening with Malaga.
Look, there was a problem
with your contract.
They're not hiring anyone
until next year.
Tell them I'll do anything,
I don't care.
Let's meet. At the usual spot
in half an hour.
She called this number.
It's the hunting lodge.
It's okay.
Coming!
Who is it'?
- Who else lives in this house?
- Nobody.
- Who?
- The watchman.
- What's his name'?
- Antonio.
- Who is Sebastian?
- I don't know.
Stop.
Where is Sebastian'?
I said stop!
Sit down.
Do you know who
Carmen and Estrella were?
Before they killed them,
they tortured them.
With a hunting knife and pliers.
They ripped off their nipples.
They cut off their toes.
They stuck something in their
and vagina until they bled.
They were awake the whole time.
You can't imagine how much pain
a person can bear before fainting.
I didn't know.
I didn't know, I didn't know...
Look at me.
What's the watchman's name'?
Sebastian.
He came looking for work
and I hired him.
His mother was my friend.
He needed to hide.
Hide from what?
I don't know.
He had changed a lot.
I hardly recognized him.
Do you know Alfonso Corrales?
Yes.
Have you ever seen him
in this house?
I don't come here
when the house is rented out.
Where is Sebastian'?
Where?
At the abandoned house
at the lodge.
Open it.
Juan!
A contract in Estrella Bianca's name
to work at the Hotel Medio Dia.
And there are more,
with other girls' names.
Hey!
There goes the car!
Come on!
Careful, it's slippery in the rain.
Careful!
Careful!
Go, go, go!
Ifs stuck.
This road leads only to the Marshland.
There's a shortcut over here!
Freeze!
Murderer!
Yeah? They asked about me?
Who?
To congratulate me?
A telegram? Open it.
DEATH IN MARSHLAND
GIRLS BUTCHERED
No, skip that.
Where it says "Destination."
Alcobendas? That's Madrid.
I can practically walk there.
How are you'?
Of course I miss you.
A lot.
I can't wait to see you both.
Pedro, come here.
This is Macarena and...
Don't tell me...
Tell me.
M ariviy
Turn around,
let him get a look at you.
Go on, turn.
You two are gorgeous.
My partner, Pedro.
- Say hi to Pedro.
- Hi, Pedro.
They work at the crab factory.
We're celebrating
because they got a raise.
They won the strike.
Long live the working class!
You want another drink'?
Come on, my treat.
Let's have a drink.
Pedro, Pedro...
Where is it'?
Where have you got it?
Right here.
Here.
Who's that? Who?
DOUBLE HOMICIDE SOLVED
IN MARSHLAND
It's him.
It's him, he's my friend.
Here, hold onto it.
For your son.
Don't lose it.
Don't lose it, Pedro.
Well? How about that drink?
You're a hero now.
Your photos.
There's somebody else
but you can't see who.
It's just a spot.
To Truman Capote.
To Truman Capote.
You were misinformed.
It wasn't him.
It was an accident.
A gift.
This enlargement came out better.
Taken the day the girl was killed
at the protest.
They called him the Crow.
He alone tortured over 100 people.
And he was the best at it.
Take care, Pedro.
Jesus made us some food for the road.
Here, I owed you this.
What is it?
Bambi stew.
Watch yourself.
You too.
We're good, right?
