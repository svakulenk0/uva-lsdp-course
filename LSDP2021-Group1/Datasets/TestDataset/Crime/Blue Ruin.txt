Yes, yes, yes.
It's Officer Eddy.
I'd like you to come
into the station.
Oh, is it about the
house, 'cause I could...
Dwight, sweetheart, I'll explain.
OK? Just come with me.
I apologize for the mystery.
I don't mean to scare you.
You're not in any trouble.
Everything's fine. You'll be fine.
But, honey, someone brought
this by our stoop.
And I just thought you should be
somewhere safe when you found out.
with somebody.
He's going to be released.
And I don't know how much you...
They are missed.
It's an awful thing he did to them.
I'm just gonna hold you
here for a little while.
Do you sell stamps?
-
-
-
-
I just want this party over with.
Wade doesn't know.
Yeah, if you stop
talking out of your ass.
You putting him on your books?
No, she talks too much.
Yeah, but I'm not used to it.
She talks shit
or she talks too much?
-  What? Me too, man?
-  Yeah.
Maybe. Just let me piss.
I haven't done it
alone in ten years.
Hey, man. You all right?
Yeah. I got some shit lined up.
You might wanna wash your hands.
No, man. I don't piss on my hands.
Hey, you want order another beer?
Yeah. I'll order some shit.
I hear that.
You motherfucker!
Come on, man. What are
you doing in there? Beating off?
Yeah, we should've had
a hooker waiting.
Let's go. The party's for you.
-
-
-
-
Ow!
Let's go, brother.
Oh, fuck.
Oh, fuck!
-
-
Did you hurt Wade?
Yeah.
Wade hurt my parents.
I don't think he did.
Let's look at the windy conditions.
Of course, with the
thunderstorms themselves,
the winds could be quite strong
and areas of fog are possible.
If you've been to the
gas pump in the last couple weeks,
you've probably felt the stinging
of some of the fastest
climbing gas prices in years.
So why are...
Small dogs and cats
should be kept in an enclosure
if left unattended, as coyotes,
oh, are able to jump...
"Sheriff - Rockbridge County"
Two, three,
four, five. One more time.
One, two, three,
four, five.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Got a late start.
Would you mind moving the
sprinklers into the bushes
- in, like, 20 minutes?
- Sure, yeah.
And then just turn it off in 15.
The girls did Shrinky
Dinks last night.
Could you put them in the
oven? Ten minutes, 350,
something like that.
It's on the box.
Thank you. Bye, girls.
- Thank you.
- Bye.
Dwight?
Hey, Sam.
You have a good day.
Thank you so much.
Hi.
I wish I had more time.
Got an asset inventory
that can't push.
Do you need money?
No.
Did you get my letter?
I sent it after
I crossed the bridge.
- It was a postcard.
- No. When?
A couple days ago.
Well, postcards take more time.
Dwight, I'm not following.
I sent it on my way to Deerfield.
I know he's out, if
that's why you're here.
The DOC sends a notification
and a restraining order.
Let's not...
I'm sorry I left.
I'm sorry, too.
With this busted sandwich.
I have had worse.
You need to put the registration
for the Bonneville in your name
if you still have it.
I have an extra set of
keys if you want them.
It's gone.
As far as the estate goes,
you're still owed $2,800.
There's still a box of your things.
You can keep it all.
I don't want it, Dwight.
No. That's fine.
I'm not used to talking this much.
That's what people do.
I know.
How's Delaware?
You knew?
Not exactly where.
We still try to go every
few years to keep the tradition.
Mostly for the kids.
You know I have two kids now?
I know.
I mean, I...
I saw you a couple of summers ago.
You were on the boardwalk.
You didn't say anything?
I...
I looked a mess.
So why now?
Wade Cleland gets released.
Well...
I thought there'd be something
on the news, but...
There's nothing.
I killed him.
Wade Cleland, I killed him.
What?
Bullshit.
When?
I think yesterday.
Oh, God, Dwight.
I thought he'd kill me first.
I'm glad he didn't.
And I'm glad he's dead
and I hope he suffered.
Excuse me.
You got ketchup on yours?
I don't.
Sorry. Thanks.
The Clelands still live
up on East Hundred.
The older one, he owns limousines.
- Yeah.
-  How great is that?
Operates out of Charlottesville.
Every time I see one
pass through town
or on the way to the airport...
Fucking June, fucking prom.
- You don't own the...
- Where are your children?
Home with the sitter.
Let's get back in your car.
- What?
- They never called the police.
OK, it's ringing.
She's not picking up.
She's not picking up.
She's not picking up.
No, no, no.
Wait.
-  Oh, God.
-  What's wrong?
I'll turn myself in
here, if that's what you want,
but I can't do it until I know...
that you're safe, that
the kids are safe, so...
The Clelands need to be arrested.
All of them?
For what?
Look, I...
Just go.
You can call the
police from Pittsburgh
if that's what you want.
Just so long as you're not here.
It's my house, Dwight.
They know that.
The car is registered here,
and it's not worth...
ls there a gun in the house?
Of course not.
Duck. My duck. Your duck.
Don't call me baby.
OK.
I only told work, nobody else.
I'd forgive you if you were crazy,
but you're not.
You're weak.
I got him.
Hey. Were you coming
for me or for her?
Were you coming for me or for her?
I, uh...
I just...
Yep.
Fuck.
I had an accident on my leg.
Hey, is somebody out there?
Hey! I'm in the trunk!
Let me out! Is that you?
Help!
Let me out!
I'm dying!
Let me out!
Let me out, you son of a bitch.
Help!
-
-
Let me out of here!
-  Let me go!
- Not until I have a gun.
Shit, I can get you a gun.
-  Hey!
-
Hey! I got to get out of here!
I'm thirsty! My leg's broken!
-  Mrs. Gaffney, hi.
- Yes?
I was looking for Ben.
Is he still in town?
No, he moved a while ago.
It's Dwight, from Orange High.
I just...
Oh.
I'm so sorry, I...
Mr. Gaffney's upstairs
asleep and...
I didn't recognize you, Dwight.
OK, this is where he works.
This is where he lives.
He moved when
he got back from Japan.
He was deployed.
You might need a map, 'cause
it's out of the way off of...
I have a map, thank you.
So are you in a rush?
Sort of. Yes, ma'am.
Otherwise I'd offer you some tea.
I'd love some tea.
Good.
Ben works late, anyway.
They play God-awful music there.
Excuse me.
- I was looking for a band member...
-  What?
I was looking
for a band member named Ben.
Ben Gaffney. And I think
he was supposed...
- You mean Benny?
- Yes.
Yeah, he's here.
He works the bar.
He's not in the band.
That's fine.
Do you know what time he goes home?
Ben.
Hey, Ben.
Ben.
Ben!
It's Dwight Evans.
Oh. Wow, man.
You look square.
I've been away.
Yeah, man.
No shit.
Just peaced the fuck out, huh?
Same year El Duce
got hit by a train.
Yo, put the first 200
miles on this thing
stapling up your "Missing" posters.
I never thought of that.
So are we getting beers or...
Look, I need to warn
you that I'm here,
that I came to you
because I need a favor,
and it's a big one.
Sure. What do you need?
You remember James
Henry's brother's party
with the stripper at his shop?
Haven't really thought
back that far in a while.
Where is it?
I got this Polaroid of you
and me with the stripper.
It's hilarious. We look terrified.
Ben, I need to hurry.
Right.
You hunt?
No.
Target shooting mostly.
Mountain biking.
What do you need this for?
- I'd rather not...
-  Oh, no.
Hey, no, man. The less
I know, the better.
What do you need out of the gun?
At range? At close quarters?
Close up or far away?
Oh, close up, probably.
I don't know.
- Hopefully not at all.
- Roger that.
All right.
Let's see what we got.
Enfield Mark Ill, Circuit Judge,
a Mosin,
- my current personal favorite.
-
Bolt Action. It's heavy.
Plus surplus ammo's cheap.
- How much do you weigh?
- I don't know.
All right.
Picked this up this year.
Shoots its own
But you got to load it slide
back with a stripper clip.
Nothing that's special to you.
Just whatever's the
least expensive.
All right. Here.
Mini-14. Gun show, no papers.
It's carbine. That
just means it's short.
Semi-auto.
It fires every time
you pull the trigger.
Twenty rounds, very reliable.
And I got extra ammo.
You recognize it?
It's the A-Team gun,
man, from the show.
Except theirs were stainless.
What's up with that?
It's an arrow wound.
So...
You're, like, in this.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
'Cause I was just blowing
smoke up your ass, bro.
Thought about calling the cops.
Please don't.
Not yet.
I don't have a speech.
I just need you to
trust me, please.
I do trust you, bro.
But I can't send you off like this.
I could train you.
CQB, man.
Surprise, speed,
violence of action.
I just need...
I just need somewhere
quiet right now.
I got 16 acres.
Take the road we came
in on till it ends.
You'll see the targets.
You ever killed anyone?
Two on purpose.
Can I get a thing of water?
Stay in the trunk.
That's easy.
My leg's broke.
Were you coming for me or for her?
- Who?
- You came to my sister's house.
Were you coming for me or for her?
Look, man. You.
Why didn't you just call the
police, send me to jail?
Same as you.
Just keeping it in-house.
What if I surrender?
I accept.
To the police.
You don't get to do what you
did and just lock yourself up.
Shit, I'd give you props
if he wasn't my brother...
or if he deserved it.
Which one are you again?
Teddy.
Who's the boy in the limousine?
He's just a boy. Not a concern.
He said something about Wade.
He said he didn't think he'd hurt anyone.
Couple dead niggers might disagree.
He just meant Wade didn't
kill your parents.
That's not true.
Well, that settles it, then.
That's how this works, man.
The one with the gun
gets to tell the truth.
Problem is, you don't know shit.
Tell me.
I should've done the time.
Are you saying you killed them?
Nope.
What are you trying to do?
What are you trying to do, man?
Goddamn!
Fish in a barrel!
Stop it!
Whatever you're
trying to say, say it.
I didn't do it.
Wade didn't do it.
Our father, Big Wade,
shot your dad.
You don't fuck with a
man's wife, his family.
Whatever my dad did,
he did with your mom.
Together, it was a mistake.
Well, shit's not a mistake.
Both of my parents are dead.
Your mother being in the car, that
was a fuck-up. I'll give you that.
If what you're saying about
Wade is true, then...
Big Wade had cancer.
Couldn't let him die in prison.
I'd have done the
time, but I had two strikes.
Little Wade, he could
take the plea.
- Call them.
- Who's them? The cops?
Your family.
What do you want me to say?
We're all gonna... we're
all gonna meet up.
Somewhere public,
and this is gonna end.
OK.
Don't say my name,
and don't mention the gun.
And we're in Kentucky.
You ever been to Kentucky?
Hey, call me back, now.
They're not answering.
Can I call the house?
Yeah.
Shut up. I'm fine.
It's my leg.
Yeah, I'm with him. He's here.
I'll try, but we already
been through that.
All right.
She wants to talk to you.
-  Who's she?
- My sister.
-  She's bossy.
- Throw it on the ground.
Keep that thing pointed right at
my face. I ain't going anywhere.
Turn your head.
Look away.
It's all over as
far as I'm concerned.
You hear that, sis?
Don't go starting...
There's nobody home, stupid fuck!
They're hunting.
Yeah! Fuck!
Fucking legs are asleep.
I'll die. I should.
But my sister never
did anything to you.
So please just tell me.
You bet.
I got the gun. You get the truth.
Not to satisfy your fucking
curiosity, Dwight.
Just know that the man that killed
your parents didn't die by your hand.
He smoked and he drank and he...
I guess he didn't fuck
'cause of the cancer,
but he watched all his
favorite TV shows,
and he died a free man.
You're gonna die like
your whore father did.
Shot in the fucking face.
Or how about first
we open up that belly?
You want to see your guts steam?
Must have something in there,
since you took Wade from us.
- And for that your sis...
-
-
-
Wait.
Just the one?
- Yes!
-  Sorry.
I had to wait for him to
aim before I could shoot.
It had to be legal,
at least on my part.
His... his head...
That's what bullets do.
Jesus. I am not impressed.
You missed from two yards?
Hey, let's go, man.
I'd like him off my property.
- OK.
-  Come on.
One, two, three.
This is Wade Cleland?
It's his older brother.
Wade's already dead.
Wipe this off your face.
He's probably got hepatitis.
Pick that up. Throw that in here.
Don't forget to wipe that
off before you get rid of it.
You got the keys?
Yeah.
Show them to me.
What about the rest of his head?
Coyotes will get that.
Long as there's no teeth.
They're not gonna let this end.
Not now.
Yeah.
Well, I'm switching
you to buckshot.
Yeah.
Doesn't have the stopping
power of a 12-gauge,
but you seem comfortable with it.
It shoots slugs too,
but you wouldn't hit anything.
It's only five shots, though,
so the Steyr is your
secondary weapon.
You get another eight rounds,
plus you got the
stopping power of a .45.
Hey.
Hey, man.
I know this is personal.
That's how you'll fail.
No speeches.
No talking.
You point the gun.
You shoot the gun.
Hey, I threw a few MREs in here.
- Uh...
-
Nice.
I lost mine.
Or shot holes in it.
I'm sorry... I brought
all this to you.
I'm glad you did.
Otherwise you'd be dead.
You know what I mean.
If it were my family, I might
do the same. I don't know.
But I'm not helping out
'cause this is right.
This is ugly, man.
If you ever find that Polaroid
of us and the stripper,
do me a favor.
Yeah?
Destroy it.
OK.
-
-
Monday. 7:38 P.M.
Hey, when you're home, stay there.
Had to swap out a tire
to tow her four down.
Hello, this is Officer Downey
with Community Corrections
calling to reach Wade Cleland.
You had a urine analysis
scheduled this morning,
which you did not attend.
Yeah, shut up. I'm fine. My leg.
I'm with him. He's here.
Why don't you keep that thing
pointed right at my face?
I'm not going anywhere.
Look away. Turn your head.
It's all over as
far as I'm concerned.
You hear that, sis?
Don't go starting any...
End of messages.
Hey, you've reached
the Cleland residence.
You know what to do and when
to do it, so get to it.
End of messages.
-
-  Hey, you've reached...
Hey, you've reached
the Cleland residence.
You know what to do and when
to do it, so get to it.
Hello. It's me.
Fuck!
-  There's a message!
-  Play it!
-  Jesus.
-
Hello. It's me.
Um, Dwight Evans.
- Wade is dead.
-  Motherfucker.
Shut the fuck up!
And... Teddy is dead, too.
He told me everything.
-  I'm gonna fucking kill him!
-  Goddamn it!
I didn't kill him.
I mean, I guess I did.
But it doesn't matter.
By my count, that's two
of yours and two of mine.
I don't know how this ends,
but I'd like it to...
Um... or it can keep going.
I just need my sister
to be left out of this.
That's why we're
going to Pittsburgh,
you dumb son of a bitch!
What the fuck are you?
-  It's him!
- I'm sorry.
We're gonna fucking kill you.
I wish you would have.
Call if you
want to talk this through.
You people...
I'm sorry to bother you at home.
- I took all the guns.
- Don't shoot us.
I've been here awhile.
I've been trying to
think of reasons
not to do this, to end your family.
I mean, there's a thousand.
But there's one why I should.
Fine. We'll leave her out.
How can I trust that?
After everything I've done.
It's not our problem.
Yes, it is.
- Go! Blow his head off!
-  Kill him, William!
- I don't want to.
- Your whole family will die.
Stop!
I don't know much about guns,
but I'm pretty sure I've
got more bullets than you.
Don't kill him.
If he dies tonight,
your father killed him.
He killed everybody here.
I think you did your job, William,
but I still got to finish up.
Quickly, I think.
It's funny.
That hurts less than the, um...
The arrow.
You can leave that gun.
Just wipe it off.
My car's down the road
a ways in the woods.
But it's dark.
He's my father's son.
Teddy told me about
Big Wade, the cancer.
Don't you mention their names.
You know what's awful?
Just 'cause my dad
loved your mom...
we all end up dead.
The keys are in the car.
The keys are in the car.
The keys are in the car.
The keys are in the car.
"Greetings from Virginia".
Even when I'm sad,
you can still hear me sing
If it should be a saint,
that he calls me today
I have your person,
I know you'll never see
If it should be a saint,
that he calls me today
No regrets, no
regrets, no regrets
I've been livin'
the life of a King.
I've been a lot of
places, oh yeah, yeah
Even when I'm sad,
you can still hear me sing
If it shall be a saint,
that he calls me today.
Whoa, oh, no regrets,
no regrets, no regrets
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
No regrets, no
regrets, no regrets.
