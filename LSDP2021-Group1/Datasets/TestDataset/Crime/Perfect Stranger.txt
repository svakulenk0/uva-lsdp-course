GUARD: Here you go, miss.
- Thank you.
MAN 1:
Step through, please.
Open your laptop, please.
I guess people take their computers
with them everywhere nowadays.
Security blanket.
Lucky blanket.
MAN 2:
Next.
Wow, even answer
your own door, senator.
I'm impressed.
Front-porch mentality.
I like to know who's visiting.
Plus, my secretary, Laura,
just stepped out for an early lunch.
Caroline Eldridge from
Family First is visiting.
You're early. I like that. Come in.
Let's take the sofa.
Okay.
ROWENA:
Hope you don't mind if I take this out.
My hard drive is now officially
my only source of memory,
and I wanna get all those
old-fashioned values down
accurately.
Now, as you know, we're putting
together our Family First brochure,
and we've got a few pictures here
that we could use captions for.
Fire away.
Okay.
Let's start with this one.
That's me and some of the staff
in the Gulf of Mexico after Katrina.
Heartbreaking stuff.
Okay.
Let's call this:
"Senator Sachs and staff
lend a hand in hurricane relief."
SACHS: Good.
ROWENA: How about that?
That's one of my
former interns,
Josh.
Must have been taken
his last day of work.
Let's call it:
"Intern program a success."
Okay.
Met a lot of
good kids that way.
I'll bet.
How about that one?
Wait, let me try.
"Intern program
has fringe benefits"?
Let's see. Ooh.
Let's call it "extramarital Sachs."
Who are you?
Someone who thinks
it's a bit hypocritical that
for the past two years
you've tried to limit the
civil rights of gay individuals
while being a gay individual yourself.
Lady--
You preach family first
as if there's only one kind
of family.
I don't know what you think
you got there, but let me just
explain something to you.
What I've got is a signed
statement by Josh.
We've got cancelled cheques
and he's practically ready to
turn over the love notes.
Laura.
Out to lunch, remember?
Looks like it's gonna be
your word against his.
And we're running his tomorrow.
I work for David Shane
at the .
Jesus Christ.
Josh O'Bannon came to us
seven months ago
and thought we'd be really
interested in knowing
that he's not the only handsome
skeleton in your closet.
So we thought we'd give you
an opportunity to respond.
Anything you want.
I will give you anything
that you want.
You just did, senator.
You just did.
ROWENA :
Please tell me
you got that.
Yeah, I got it,
you psychopath.
Now, jump on the shuttle,
get your ass down to the paper,
and we'll get fantastically,
exceedingly drunk.
SACHS :
MAN:
One more time.
You transmitted from D.C.
And recorded in New York.
Go to Legal. It'll check.
I intend to.
Also we'll need to clear
the quote from the intern.
He's at home waiting for the call.
This your headline,
David Shane?
Yep.
We'll be at Chumley's
ordering copious amounts
of drinks on this paper.
God, I love this job.
Hey, hey. To David Shane.
May this article bring you
all the prizes you deserve.
Fame, alcoholism,
rehab, relapse, rehab.
And when you win the Pulitzer,
don't forget the little people.
Oh, fuck the little people.
Hey, you're empty.
You buy, I fly.
Oh.
Excuse me, sweetheart.
Careful, Ro. Next round
he might aim for your lips.
Mr. Arvis Narron.
What kind of name is Arvis?
Family name.
Story's been pulled, Ro.
Somebody got to your intern.
Made him clam up.
My guess is somebody
with lots of zeroes.
What?
Well...
I'm just gonna go call him.
You'll get his lawyer,
just like we did.
Do you know I've been working
on this story for six months?
Six.
Take a couple weeks off.
You've earned the break.
I'm gonna go back
to the office right now.
This guy's got a stack
of interns, trust me.
Kolski wants you to take
a couple of weeks off.
That's not a request.
Okay, wait, hold up.
Please tell me
you're not saying that because the
paper endorsed Sachs' last campaign
that he's off-limits now.
Please tell me that is not
what you're saying.
What's up, Narron?
Get this, Miles.
Tomorrow's headline:
"Free Press Dead."
Kolski wants to shut me down
because I went after the senator.
Does it ever get to you, Narron?
The idea that we're supposed
to be reporting the news,
not covering it up?
Like when we couldn't show the dead
bodies coming back from Iraq.
If you don't see it, then that
means it never happened.
Your source ran dry, Ro.
My source didn't run dry.
You can't try to cover up--
My source was paid off.
This is a good story, Narron.
The story's dead.
Classic.
Powerful men
protecting powerful men.
Who backed you when you
wanted to be anonymous,
when you wanted to write under
an old boy's name?
This is not the first time you shut me
down, but this is definitely the last.
So you tell Kolski keep his paid
vacation, because I fucking quit.
Taxi. Hey.
GRACE:
Rowena?
Rowena. Wait up.
Wait. Wait.
Fuck.
Rowena.
Grace. Shit, you scared me.
You didn't return
my phone calls.
Well, yeah, I've been pretty
busy working out of town.
GRACE: Oh, yeah.
The Senator Sachs scandal.
Don't worry.
I didn't tell anyone.
Besides, I got a better
story for you.
It's about Harrison Hill.
Come on.
We met online.
We did.
He was giving a Q and A, I e-mailed
him and told him how great it was.
You know, stroke a man's dick
and you get him for one night.
Stroke his ego,
you get him for life, huh?
Yeah, we sort of struck up
a friendship online,
but I could tell that he liked me.
So I decided to come to New York
and accidentally bump into him.
I knew about his fundraiser,
so I bought a ticket,
walked right up to him and said,
"Harrison, it's Fast Filly."'
I thought he was
gonna be angry.
But instead,
he's turned on by it.
He likes the balls of it.
"Stick around," he says.
Couple hours later, we're doing it
in his Beemer, his hotel suite.
He keeps one, creep.
What happened to Chuck?
We're fighting more
than we're fucking.
Anyway, I get back to Philly,
our online stuff gets pretty hot.
He misses me.
I mean, he practically
begs me to move here.
So I check out apartments
and agencies,
and I wanna tell him,
you know, I'm really excited.
But suddenly,
I can't get ahold of him.
I mean, I sent him a million
e-mails and he just cuts me off.
Cold. Fucker.
I know where Hill lives.
I've seen his Armani wife.
He has no idea
what I can do to him.
What is it you want
from me this time, Grace?
Actions have
consequences, Ro.
You can't just
forget people.
Bury them and pretend
like they never existed.
It always comes
back to haunt you.
I wonder what Hill would think
if David Shane threatened to
publish a few of his e-mails?
I'm sure the wife would
find them interesting.
Take them. Read them.
Because I'm about an inch away
from ringing this guy's doorbell.
Regards to your mother.
I know where Hill lives.
I've seen his Armani wife.
He has no idea what
I can do to him.
MILES:
And when you win the Pulitzer,
don't forget the little people.
ROWENA :
MILES:
ROWENA:
WOMAN:
Elizabeth.
Hi.
Elizabeth, hang on a second.
I saw Grace last week.
ROWENA:
Hi, I'm Rowena Price.
Here to ID a body.
Whoever did this tried
to weigh the body down.
Amateur move.
Why is that?
Didn't work.
Fair warning.
This isn't pretty.
We're guessing an anchor
or some sharp metal debris
ripped off the face and neck.
So we're hoping that you could
identify something else.
She has a birthmark, scars,
and it looks like a tattoo--
GIRL:
Hi, Rowena.
Do you wanna play?
Well, are you coming?
I live up there.
ELIZABETH:
Who would do this
to my daughter?
We're gonna find out,
Mrs. Clayton.
Do you mind if I ask you
a few questions?
Can you excuse us?
No. She's a friend of the family.
Do you know if your daughter
had been seeing anyone?
Yeah.
Chuck. Chuck Freeman.
But they'd been
having trouble.
Yeah, she told me that too.
I ran into her on
the subway last week,
and she mentioned
that they were having fights.
Was that the last time you saw her?
Yeah.
I mean, I tried to call her, but she was
in the middle of something, and...
Well, I wish now I had tried
a little bit harder.
Oh, I know, honey.
They knew each other
since they were kids.
You were so close, you two,
especially after your father--
Yeah, I know.
Well, you were always so good
to me and my mother.
So was Grace.
Mrs. Clayton, we're gonna need you
to sign some papers downstairs.
Certainly.
I'll be just a minute.
Ro.
You know,
Grace was so proud of you.
She saved all your articles.
She bragged about you.
How did she know
that I was David Shane?
I assumed you told her.
I probably did.
Thank you.
The police are gonna find out
exactly who did this.
I'll make sure they do.
Thank you, honey.
MILES:
Hey.
ROWENA:
Hey, Miles.
Let me get the key.
MILES: I'm usually a
key-above-the-door kind of guy.
ROWENA:
Mm-hm.
Hey, Miles.
Yeah.
When was the last time
you saw Grace?
Oh, God, you know me
and dates, I--
All right,
well, roughly.
A week? A month? A year?
Five years? What?
Yeah, something
like that. Why?
Because.
Just because I cut
somebody out of my life
doesn't mean I expect you
to cut them out of yours.
Well, maybe you do.
All right, maybe I do.
Why you got to keep it a secret?
You know, we exchanged e-mails
a couple of times. I was only
ever nice to her because
she was a friend of yours.
So you told her
I was David Shane?
Yeah. Busted.
Could you be serious for five
fucking minutes?
I'll bet you told her about
Senator Sachs too, didn't you?
You know when I stopped
associating with her was
when she fucked your boyfriend.
I think you should
ask him who told her.
I think you need to stay in your own
fucking lane, that's what I think.
You just better leave Cam
out of it. I mean it, Miles.
Ro, I'm sorry.
I was being insensitive.
Ro, I'm sorry.
It's just-- I was the one who
was left picking up the pieces
after Grace and Cameron
tore you apart and I-- And I--
Yeah. So, what
do the police say?
They're chasing a lead on some
guy she was dating in Philly.
But I have another idea.
Why's that?
Because I saw Grace
last week.
Oh, I'm the one
who's keeping secrets?
She wanted me to chase
down Harrison Hill.
What, "Harrison Hill"
Harrison Hill?
Yes, that Harrison Hill.
Here, take a look at this.
She was threatening
to go to his wife.
Apparently, they met
online in July
and had one hell of
a weekend in September.
I mean, that's assuming
he is ADEX.
Wait. Who? Who?
ADEX.
The guy she's been
e-mailing, ADEX.
I mean, it tracks.
Harrison Hill owns
the biggest ad agency
in New York City?
"I'm gonna fuck you so hard,
I'm gonna split you in half."
Oh, my.
Oh, my goodness.
Wait a minute, Ro.
This is not a story.
Miles, I would love, love, love
to get my hands on the rest
of these e-mails.
Because the way I see it, Grace was
fucking Hill, he dumped her,
she got pissed, threatened to go
to the wife, and she wound up dead.
I mean, come on.
It's simple, that's it.
Ro, Ro. This is Harrison Hill.
If he wanted somebody dead,
he wouldn't do it hims--
That's just the first of all.
She was stalking the guy,
for chrissake.
She sent him a million e-mails.
She probably even went to his house.
Who knows?
All it takes
to commit a murder
are the right ingredients
at the right time.
MILES:
Son of a bitch.
MILES :
ROWENA:
G.W. Bridge. Why? What's up?
I got into Grace's Hotmail
account. It's her main one.
And there's a shitload of guys
in there, by the way.
But none of them are ADEX.
Yeah, but that's not the
account I gave you, Miles.
Well, hold on. And then I looked at her
other account, FastFilly@iol.com,
and guess who's all up
in her box. ADEX. Ro.
Yeah?
You got to read some of this shit.
Okay. So, I'm gonna bring over
everything after work.
And, Ro, we still don't know
that ADEX is Hill.
And we still don't know
that he's not.
Yeah.
Hey, your dinner's
getting warm.
Hold it.
Can I just say
for the record, wow.
Can I also say that's just
a ridiculous outfit to be
wearing for takeout?
Well, I didn't know
you were bringing takeout.
Well, I didn't know
you had a date.
Oh, God.
Who's the...?
Who's the lucky guy?
Can we just look
at the e-mails, please?
Sure. Yeah. Here, here.
Have a seat.
Okay.
Uh...
So, yeah.
You told me that Grace
wanted you to threaten Hill.
Well, she was doing it without you
for a while. Listen. This, this--
This e-mail's a week old
and it's her last one.
"Harrison, if you don't," capital,
"pay attention to me...
you're going to," capital,
"pay the price.
I'm in the city
and I know your wife's away.
Meet with me now,
or I'll meet with her later."
So Grace knew that
the wife was out of town.
Right, but you're going under the
assumption that Grace actually knew
what she was talking about,
which I think is a big mistake.
By the way, even though
she calls ADEX Harrison,
it doesn't prove that it's Harrison
Hill. It's not proof enough to print.
Okay. So how do we prove it?
Well, technically
we can't prove it,
but if we can get ADEX
to somehow send us an e-mail,
I can tail it, jimmy the lock, and then
take a closer look into his account.
You are amazing.
I love you, man.
This is just such an
obstruction of justice.
No, no, no.
This is the pursuit of justice.
I'll make you a deal.
We get anything concrete on Hill,
we'll go straight to the cops
and to Narron on the same day.
They get their man.
We get our story.
Yeah, but even if ADEX
turns out to be Hill,
it's not a crime to chat
nor cheat.
But it is definitely a crime to be
walking out on a feast like this
in that outfit.
And yet, I have to
because I'm late.
So you finish up.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Shut the door.
It locks by itself.
Have fun.
MILES:
Harrison Hill.
Oh, there you are.
ROWENA:
Cam. Oh, Cam.
CAMERON:
Come here. You are naughty.
ROWENA:
Come on.
CAMERON:
Come here.
ROWENA:
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
ROWENA: You like that? Huh?
CAMERONA: Yes, baby.
ROWENA:
Oh, come on. Say it.
Yeah, oh, yeah.
You like it? You like that?
Yeah, good.
ROWENA:
I need to get closer to Hill.
MILES :
Hello, Miles. How are you?
Fine. You?
I need to get closer to Hill.
Close as you got to Cam
last night?
It's a little soon to be going
on dates with Grace's ex,
don't you think?
Oh, I'm sorry, your ex.
What, are you fucking
spying on me now?
What? You get him by default?
ROWENA:
Well, not that I owe you or
your friend an explanation.
But I wanted to see Cam.
Somebody had to tell him
about Grace.
Well, I guess we all
grieve differently.
You know what, Miles?
Forget it.
If you don't wanna help me,
I'm sure Terry wouldn't mind.
He's been dying to get
into research.
Oh, Terry couldn't find his ass
with both hands and his ass.
ROWENA:
Okay. Good.
While you're looking around
in cyberspace,
I need to be looking around
at my new job
that you, clever friend,
are going to get me.
Oh, God love you.
Something temporary. Easy in,
easy out. Can you do that?
Does a bear shit in the woods?
H2A's got a blade server
that gives away more entry points
than a college girl at Mardi Gras.
I'll access the needs list
they send to temp agencies.
Shouldn't be too hard.
There's always openings.
And, hey, wear something sexy.
What?
You need to bait the hook.
Just make sure
I'm working for Hill.
MILES:
ROWENA:
MILES:
Going to H2A.
H2A.
MILES:
ROWENA:
MILES:
There you go.
Thank you.
Now, if you'll follow me.
MILES:
ROWENA:
MILES:
We have a new temp.
Her name is Katherine Pogue.
Hi.
Hi.
ESMERALDA: Thank you.
I'll show you to your desk.
And press 9 to get out,
But I'll be right across
from you, so you shouldn't
have any problem finding me.
ESMERALDA:
Katherine, we need a coffee setup
in Conference Room A.
ROWENA:
Will I be working for Mr. Hill?
ESMERALDA:
No. I'm working for Mr. Hill.
You're working for me.
And you'd better roll up
your sleeves, because we
are short-staffed this week.
JON:
Sensational, Harrison. Really.
Spectacular.
I hear you're thinking about opening
in Amsterdam, by the way.
Yes, we did. In April.
Really?
ESMERALDA:
Excuse me, Mr. Hill.
Mr. Kirschenbaum's car is downstairs
and your 2:00 is waiting.
HARRISON:
Thanks, Esmeralda.
I'll walk you out, Jon.
JON: Great. Thanks.
You're doing well.
I'm very proud of you.
I couldn't have done it without you.
I learned from the best.
I appreciate it.
Thanks for coming by.
Listen, this is probably
just bullshit,
but, you know, one of my guys
heard that a couple of your execs
were in Canton
sniffing around
my Reebok account.
If you're so sure it's bullshit,
why are you asking me?
Because they heard about it
from inside your agency.
I just don't want you to make
that kind of mistake, Harrison.
I've been representing
Reebok for 11 years.
They're my main account,
you know that.
They're not gonna jump ship for your
smile and some downtown hype.
Eat or be eaten. Right, Jon?
Isn't that what you
always told me?
Now, you left the Reebok
account out on the table.
If I didn't pick it up, someone else
was going to and you know that.
Ten years ago you wouldn't have let
this happen. You fumbled the ball.
You really are that stupid.
Give my regards
to Vanessa.
Esmeralda.
We have a leak to
Kirschenbaum and Bond.
I wanna find out who
the fuck it is. Right now.
Hold the door, please.
Wait. Thank you.
That was close.
BETHANY:
Harrison, will you be attending
the Victoria's Secret meeting tonight?
I was hoping maybe
I could catch a ride.
Yeah, I think I'll be going.
Okay.
ROWENA:
Keep the meter running.
We can go now.
MAN:
You know how much
Daddy likes bath time.
ESMERALDA: We have
a Victoria's Secret party tonight.
Good morning, Esmeralda.
Good morning, Katherine.
Two hundred guests,
Five items per bag. Have fun.
ROWENA:
Well, it wasn't just a drowning.
She was poisoned.
She had a hole in her gut
the size of a fruit bowl.
Oh, come on.
MILES: No, that's a direct quote
from the examiner's office.
The killer also put it in her eyes,
Ro, they haven't
announced it yet,
but Grace was pregnant.
WOMAN:
Hello. I'm Gina.
Katherine Pogue, are you in here?
Oh, there you are.
I could tell you Victoria's secret,
but then I'd have to kill you.
Clever, huh?
Yeah.
Mr. Hill came up with it for the
"Very Sexy Collection" launch.
Ooh, very sexy.
And in a rainbow
of colors.
Here, keep a few
for the home fires.
I know a pretty girl like you
has a boyfriend.
No.
Girlfriend?
Pets?
No.
Well, we've got some
local talent here.
I'll say. What's up with Hill?
He's interesting.
Married.
Rumor is, and you
didn't hear it from me,
he had a couple of interoffice flings
a few years back, led to lawsuits.
Paid a lot of money
to make them go away.
That's when he got his
front girl to run interference.
That would be Josie.
Or, if you get on her bad side,
Cujosie.
She's his gatekeeper.
His walking hard drive.
So he never forgets a name,
an account, an enemy.
No one gets to him now
without going through her.
Let me guess,
he's done her too, right?
Oh, no.
No. She'd be more interested
in you than in him, if you catch
my heavy drift.
I think I do.
Well, she's his watchdog,
not his bitch.
The guy's reformed, unfortunately.
Right.
His wife's all over him.
She's got eyes in the back
of your head.
Trust me.
She finds him cheating,
she and her money are out the door.
Oh. See Jesse Drake
over there?
He had this blond temp
last fall could melt butter.
Her name was Veronica.
One day, the boss's
wife comes in,
sees Mr. H and Veronica talking
close over the Sparkletts,
the next day the temp's toast.
The boy's been leashed.
But since I have it on good authority
he's into some very kinky shit.
He probably likes
the tight collar.
I'd let him give me a little spank.
Did I just say that out loud?
You're sick.
HARRISON:
Boo!
Sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.
Sorry.
You're Katherine, right?
And you're Harrison Hill,
the boss.
Yes.
It's good to be the boss.
Yeah.
So I'll see you at the
party tonight, Katherine.
Here we go.
On behalf of Victoria's Secret,
I would like to thank our very
special angel,
Harrison Hill, for making us
sexier than ever.
Harrison.
I have no idea how
we could possibly make
you look any sexier
than you do tonight, Heidi.
Thank you so very much.
I'd just like to raise a glass
to everyone at Victoria's Secret
and all my people at H2A
for making this one of the
most successful campaigns,
a Very Sexy Collection
is H2A's most sexful--
Succsexf--
We did really good
with this campaign.
Happy Valentine's Day.
God bless you.
Thank you. Good night.
So is part of the torture
the fact that we get to
watch all this fun?
Are you kidding me?
We got the best seats
in the house.
Okay, see the guy with the bad
combover standing by the statues?
Bob Milstein,
Accounting.
He may look unlucky in love.
He recently nailed
Kay Rolands, Sales,
the giant standing
by the shrimp.
Corporate America, ain't it grand?
One big happy family, eh?
Who's the loud-laughing brunette?
The one that looks a little tipsy.
GINA: Oh, Bethany Lee,
account manager.
Long legs, perfect teeth,
may they rot in hell.
A few years back
there was chatter
she and Mr. Hill were going over
more than just the company numbers.
Really?
Yeah.
But that was before the
lawsuits, before Cujosie,
and before the wife
started paying attention.
Now it's all hugs and kisses
and they're going to fertility clinics.
I think her oven's on the fritz.
Is there anything
you don't know, Gina?
No.
ROWENA:
I don't get it. Mrs. Hill is pretty.
I mean, she's really pretty.
Show me a beautiful woman,
I'll show you a man who's tired
of fucking her.
ROWENA: Nice, Gina.
What? I've got brothers.
Hi.
WOMAN:
Hey.
You're embarrassing him
and yourself.
Okay, I'll be better.
His wife is out there.
BETHANY:
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
JOSIE:
Here's money for a cab.
Come on.
He'll call me, right?
Good night, Bethany, good night.
I told you already,
Narron, I quit.
I figured two weeks was
enough to let you cool off.
I gotta go.
Look, I'm sorry about the senator,
Ro, but I can't lose you.
David Shane is this paper's star.
You don't bench a star, Narron.
There will always be powerful
people covering things up, Ro,
at every paper, in every city.
It's called editorializing
and it's a reality.
Don't give up
because one son of a bitch
pulled some strings at the paper
and silenced your source.
Rest up, come back,
and nail the next
son of a bitch.
Maybe.
So I set up your IOL account,
but you're gonna need a name.
ROCKET:
How about Rocket?
That was my nickname
from college.
Are you sure you don't wanna be
"Hot Bitch on Wheels"?
No, I'm kidding. All right,
Rocket, Rocket, "Rocketgirl."
A little sexier than
DShane@NYCourier.com.
So I put ADEX
into your friends file,
and as a little extra added bonus
your computer has a few things
to say. Listen, this is good.
WOMAN 1 :
WOMAN 3:
Translation?
Let me guess.
Miles is sexy?
You think so?
And I need this, why?
Because it's fucking radical.
Every time you get an IM,
you're gonna have a voice to match.
I don't want my computer talking
to me. And I damn sure don't want
it saying, "Miles is sexy."
I'll just give an audio to Hill.
I sampled his voice
from some streaming video.
You don't mind if Hill talks, do you?
Do I have a choice?
No.
So, what's he like
up close and personal?
Well, tell you one thing,
there's more to the guy
than you think.
You should check out
his offices.
Go online, take the tour.
You'll see. It's outrageous.
Sick. Just what you'd like.
Oh, you know what, by the way,
I did find something out. Apparently,
Hill has squashed a couple
of sexual-harassment suits.
Think you could chase
the money trail?
Yeah, well, I guess he's
a likely candidate for that.
No, not really.
He's now got this gorgeous
Amazonian woman
that does all the dirty work.
Oh, really? Is she hot?
Yes.
She's very hot.
She's also a lesbian.
Bastard.
All right, so seeing that
you're a chat-room virgin...
Big deal, I'm a chat-room virgin.
No, I think it's a compliment.
I think you should
practice online flirting.
Why on earth would
I want to do that?
Because sometimes
you'll tell a perfect stranger
something you wouldn't even
tell your best friend. Especially
if you're anonymous.
You should know that,
Mr. David Shane.
Oh, by the way, I got a dollar
that says Hill's not our guy.
We got a pregnant Grace,
threatening to go to the wife, right?
Yeah.
Okay, but meanwhile, the wife
is busy trying to haul Hill off
to a fertility clinic.
And let's not forget the most
important part, the wife is the money.
Yeah.
I don't know.
That's motive on a big stick.
Motive on a big stick?
That's what I said.
So I'll take your bet.
Game on.
COMPUTER VOICE:
ROWENA:
"Trublu?" Okay.
COMPUTER VOICE:
ROWENA:
"Haven't seen you around."
New to this. Who are you?
Hello, Neil, I'm Tiffany.
Okay, Trublu, let's go.
How do you imagine me?
"Long blond hair, longer legs--"
Really close.
COMPUTER VOICE:
"When you said you were getting off,
I didn't know you meant literally."
Leave me alone.
ROWENA:
I haven't contacted him.
"I did on his--"
Hello.
Okay, look, this isn't funny.
You're taking
advantage of me.
Relax. This is exactly
what we talked about.
Once he responds,
I can get past his firewall.
It's the price of admission, Ro.
I wrote, "Dear Harrison,
the answers are: Great sex,
cheap beer and the Rolling Stones."
What?
ROWENA:
Oh, shit. He's on.
There he is. Let me drive.
Wait. Wait, wait, wait. Miles.
Harrison--
Nice to hear from you.
Miles, you're typing for me?
It's a riddle.
All right, fine. Fine. Fine.
I'm through the firewall into
ADEX's account. He's all yours.
Miles, you bastard.
MAN :
ROWENA:
Shit.
Veronica.
Blond.
Dirty.
Filthy.
Ew.
I am.
Fucker.
I should go.
Yeah. Don't blueball the guy.
"Yeah, Ro.
Don't blueball the guy."
I'll be back. Bye.
COMPUTER VOICE:
Would you quit spying on me,
you fuck?
You are officially in the way
of how I work and I'm not having it.
It's Hill.
We can prove it now.
Do not send any more e-mails
on my behalf. And do not speak
for me in any way.
How about, "Thank you, Miles,
for your subversive genius"?
Thank you. Bye.
MAN 1: Good morning, H2A.
May I help you?
Hey, good morning.
WOMAN: How are you?
MAN 2:
Good morning, H2A.
ROWENA:
Oh.
Hello.
"What happened
to you last night?"
Morning.
"Tiffany? Veronica?"
ESMERALDA:
Katherine.
You forgot to fill out your I-9.
Oh. Okay.
I told Human Resources
I'd run it right back over there,
now.
Okay, well, I'll just fill this out.
You looking for permanent work?
Always.
Where have you temped?
I don't know.
Got a phone book?
Yes, I do.
Okay.
Zaffman, Meyer and Pearce, I.P.E.--
Ooh, I love the new building.
Great bathrooms.
What about Kirschenbaum
and Bond?
Average bathrooms.
When did you work there?
I don't know, maybe April.
I don't know.
My life is kind of crazy.
One day just runs into the next.
MAN 1: Heineken Amsterdam
is gonna love it, Harrison.
We should start talking
about print, scheduling, tie-ins.
MAN 2:
It can play internationally too.
Jesse, why don't you start talking
about media buys with Chuck,
Toni and Steve.
I need a couple minutes.
I'll be right back.
I'm glad you're happy.
So glad you're happy.
When do you think
we could roll it to print?
Here, hold this, please.
Esmeralda, hold my calls
for a few minutes, please.
Phelps. Mr. Phelps.
Afternoon, boys.
Gunnar, do me a favor
and stand up, would you? Get out!
Piece of shit?
You're gonna spy on me?
Here, get the fuck up,
you piece of sh--
You were a fucking
bike messenger.
I made you rich.
I hope they have a job for you
over at Kirschenbaum.
I accept your resignation.
Gunnar.
Congratulations.
Now clean up your new office.
Back to work.
What are you guys looking at?
Shit. What just happened?
Gunnar Hope
just got a promotion.
ROWENA:
"Veronica, how did you know
about my ADEX account?"
I used to temp at H2A.
Yeah.
My boyfriend
wouldn't like that.
Shit.
Does this phone call
mean I'm forgiven?
You've got once chance
to redeem yourself.
He wants a photo of Veronica.
Who?
Me. Rocketgirl.
Is nude an option?
There was a temp
that used to work here
around Christmastime.
"Veronica something."
You gotta be kidding me.
No, she used to work for Jesse Drake.
Every employee here has
got a security photo ID.
She's gotta be in the files.
Miles. Do it.
A last name would really help.
Yeah, well, how many Veronicas
can there be in the system?
Come on, Miles.
This is ridiculous. Come on.
Come on. Come on.
Hurry up. Miles.
MILES: Okay.
ROWENA:
Come on, come on.
Yahtzee.
Veronica Carter. Just download,
upload, exhale and send.
You are awesome.
MILES:
Yeah, well, remember that
the next time you're firing me.
I'm meeting my guy
from the M.E.'s office, Bill Patel,
at Chumley's at 7:00.
He's got all the talks on Grace,
and everything else the cops have.
Great. I'll meet you there.
Shit.
My computer screen
is frozen. And Veronica's
face is the screen saver.
What?
Miles.
Oh, fuck.
Fuck, he's coming.
Hi.
Hi.
Pretty busy for the end of the day.
Yeah.
Just working away.
Anything I can
help with?
Nope.
Not unless data entry
turns you on.
You know what?
Surprisingly, it doesn't.
But seriously,
how you doing?
Let me tell you about my night.
I have to go to dinner at Sapa.
Average jokes, exceptional food.
If you find
yourself bored
in the area of 24th and Sixth
around 10:00,
you could fall by
for a drink.
I really appreciate that offer,
but I think I'm gonna have to pass.
Okay.
Is there something else
I can do for you, or--?
No.
I'm just waiting for you
to change your mind.
Look, Mr. Hill--
I recognize that tone.
Sounds serious.
I really like working here.
And I would really like for
my work to speak for itself.
Fair enough.
Have a splendid evening,
Miss Pogue.
Wait. Mr. Hill?
Mm-hm.
In case I change my mind...
keep an eye out around dessert.
Hey, how you guys doing?
Miles.
Bill Patel, Rowena Price.
Hey. A pleasure.
You can lose the glasses, Bill.
This isn't Deep Throat.
Here's your piña colada,
hold the umbrella.
ROWENA:
We know about the drowning,
Bill, but what was this poison?
Belladonna.
What's that?
Highly toxic plant that's used
to make atropine.
You know what that is, right?
Well, yeah. Atropine
is used to dilate eyes.
And for anesthesia, and in cardiac
medicine as a resuscitant,
and witchcraft.
Coroner had cause of death
listed as atropine poisoning,
but I did a further test on the bile
and found it was belladonna.
Which means what?
It's not the expensive synthetic type,
so it's more readily available,
harder to narrow down
where it came from.
Where do you get it?
Well, you don't pop into Duane Reade
and order a vial, but it's accessible.
Easy enough to find
if you know where to look.
Besides, nowadays, you can
pretty much get anything online.
MILES:
But it's definitely toxic?
Belladonna is used for
eye surgeries, but never
in this amount.
The killer put it
in her eyes.
Her death was brutal
and certainly no accident.
Cheers.
Where you going?
I gotta run.
Well, stick around for a while.
I can't.
I gotta run home and change.
Going out for a drink. Buy maybe
Bill here can tell you more about it.
Bill? You okay?
Brain freeze.
Who are you getting drinks with?
I will call you later.
Bill, you have been
a godsend. Thank you.
Breathe through the nose.
Nice dress.
Nice party.
Tell you what.
Order two Hemingway daiquiris.
This joint is one of two places
in all of New York City
that makes great daiquiris.
I'll be back in time to tell you
why they taste like heaven.
Did I tell you that's
a great-looking dress?
HARRISON:
No, no, no.
WAITER: You ready?
Two daiquiris.
Thank you.
I'm dizzy from the spin
and I'm all the way over here.
Here.
A very famous man once said
that sincerity is everything.
Once you learn to fake that,
the rest is easy.
So the Hemingway daiquiri
is two ounces of light rum,
one ounce--
One ounce lime juice,
one ounce simple syrup,
dash grapefruit,
grenadine float.
Oh, I knew I had to worry
about you. You pay attention.
I do. For instance,
I noticed that wedding ring.
Oh, yes. I am married.
So what?
So, what are you doing here with me?
I'm having a Hemingway
daiquiri with you.
What are you doing here with me?
Am I with you?
Are you married?
Wow, that would make this
really interesting, wouldn't it?
No. God, no.
No?
Just broke up with someone?
No.
Gay?
No.
Actually, I'm thinking
of joining Match.com.
No, you're not. Are you kidding me?
Yes.
Lots of people date online.
You're gorgeous.
What do you think of it?
My life is complicated
enough as it is.
I'm sitting here,
having a drink with you.
I'm trying to figure out
how I'm gonna explain that.
Will you have to?
Hopefully not.
Hopefully not.
Do you have kids?
No. You don't have any kids, right?
No.
Family?
A mother.
Here is to Gunnar Hope
and his corner office.
Oh, God.
That was a little dramatic, wasn't it?
Yeah.
I refuse to be treated like that.
That fucking Phelps.
Rat.
Committed the cardinal sin.
Which is what?
Don't betray your friends.
Don't betray people who love you.
Law of the jungle, huh?
Law of the universe.
It's not kill or be killed anymore.
Kill or become irrelevant.
So here's to not becoming
irrelevant.
And don't be mad.
Don't be mad that I'm married
or any of that.
I mean, because that's, you know,
a different thing than what this is.
Is it?
I should probably just
make some arrangements
to have a car take you home.
Okay.
Okay.
Drink your Hemingway daiquiri.
Hello.
Where the hell have you been, kiddo?
Late night.
Yeah, I'll bet.
Hey, wait a minute.
Are you drunk?
No, I'm not.
What's up?
About?
I kind of thought that we were
doing this story together.
We are.
I know, but I'm the one who's
doing all the grunt work while
you're out all night drinking.
You know, I mean, at least,
you can introduce me to the--
At least, you can
introduce me to the lesbian.
Take the virtual tour.
I'm sure there's a lovely
picture of her there, Miles.
Wait, wait, wait.
Remember that series of murders
they traced back to Riverbank Park?
The drifter they never caught?
Women that were being murdered
and tossed off the cliffs?
Yeah, yeah.
The Rufus Scott series.
Yeah, well, the cops think
maybe the drifter tossed Grace.
Yeah, well, maybe.
But I'm gonna go to bed,
so let's talk about it tomorrow.
Sweet dreams.
MAN :
What did you have in mind?
This is some good shit.
Save this chat.
Ew. She did?
Not quite.
You are a twisted--
Where's your wife?
Out. Figured.
Looks like it's just
you and me, Hill.
No.
Are you trying to seduce me,
mister?
Wait a minute, now I'm gonna
get your whole name,
Harrison Hill.
Robe.
Panties.
Ask what color. Come on, come on.
I know it. What color?
I knew it.
White. Sheer.
You like that?
No, no. Let's keep this real.
Let's put this at H2A.
Yes.
I got to tell you about this, Miles.
Miles, chatting with Hill,
talking about H2A.
I'm coming.
Sorry. My hands were a little busy.
Ew.
God, you're easy.
Okay.
MILES:
Trail your hands to your panties.
Go inside.
Can you feel me
fucking you, Ro?
Hey.
Hi.
What are you doing here?
Giving you breakfast.
Good morning.
Yeah? Morning.
Don't answer it.
I have to answer it.
No, you don't.
Wait, hold that thought.
No, no.
Don't. Tell them that you're busy.
Don't answer that.
Hey.
MILES:
Okay, Cam. Please give me
a second. I gotta take this.
Wait, tell me you didn't just say,
"Cam, give me a minute."
Oh, you're busy, huh?
Well, look, there's too much
to go over right now.
Yeah.
I hate that he's there, Ro.
Yeah, I know you do.
Hey, Ro.
Did Cam happen to mention
that he's having a DNA test today
for Grace's baby?
Coffee.
Did he happen to mention that?
What is it with great women
and shitty men?
You figure it out. Tell me later.
No more phones.
What are you doing later?
You.
No, I mean, like later.
This afternoon later.
Showing a couple
of places uptown.
Oh, really?
What about downtown?
What do you mean?
Thirty-first Precinct.
What?
Three o'clock.
Fucking liar. Thought you said you
hadn't seen Grace in over a year.
I haven't.
Uh-huh. That must be why
the cops have you with her
three months ago.
Thanks, Miles.
Thought you said it was over, Cam.
You said you didn't give
a shit about that bitch.
Remember that?
I don't.
You sat your ass right there and said,
"I love you, Ro."
I do, Ro.
You're a fucking liar.
Was it yours?
Could it have been yours?
I don't know.
You don't know.
Ro--
Get the hell out of my house.
WOMAN: Good morning, Larry.
MAN: Good morning.
HARRISON:
Hey.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Okay.
I give up. What?
You didn't read the paper today?
Today is "National Take Your
Best Employee to Work Day."
Mmm. So I guess you're going
to pick up Esmeralda next.
You know what? Esmeralda rides
a broom to work every day.
That's funny. Very funny.
A sense of humor.
Bobby, say hi to Katherine.
MIA: Hi, Esmeralda, it's me again.
Is he still in a meeting?
Well, just let him know I called
and I'll see him later.
Thanks.
Thank you.
Gentlemen, welcome to New York,
or as we like to call it, Reebok Town.
Come and have a seat
right over here.
That ass kissing will go on
all afternoon. Wanna take
a long lunch?
No, actually, I can't. I've got
to meet a friend downtown.
I'll see you.
Fancy lady.
So, what's up?
I stumbled across some information
about Hill's wife
and her family fortune.
I mean, they had millions
and millions and millions.
And they invested a lot of it
into medical research.
One of the guys they backed
revolutionized surgery
by finding a medicinal use
for a poisonous plant
called belladonna.
We have proof that Hill was ADEX.
We have proof that ADEX knew Grace.
We have the motive,
the pregnancy,
and now we have knowledge
and history that links Hill
directly with belladonna.
The only thing we don't
have is access to Hill's
personal e-mail account.
What are you talking about?
We do have access.
That's his IOL account.
His main account is with H2A.
I can't get to it. There's a firewall.
There's something new.
I can't scale it with a remote.
Take this.
And what's that?
It's new spyware that you're
gonna mickey into Hill's laptop.
Go at the end of the day,
install it into the computer,
ROWENA:
MILES:
SPYrid?
Fuck. What?
MILES:
Okay. So he's got antispyware
on his computer. There's
a big fucking sign that says,
"Stop in the name of SPYrid."
SPYrid? Oh, he's definitely
hiding something.
What do I do now?
He's asking for a password.
It's new. Look, I can get in,
but it'll take a few minutes.
Just take the flash drive out,
we'll do it later. I'm sorry.
Sorry? All you can say is sorry?
Well, I don't--
Well, tell me something.
Usually the competition's
a little smarter
than to send a beautiful temp
into the boss's office
to snoop around on his fucking
computer to try and find fresh ideas.
I-- Well, I--
No, wait.
Let me see if I can help you.
I am in your office,
and I really need to come up
with a really honest story.
No. I was really just gonna--
I don't know, tell you the truth.
Go ahead. Give that a shot.
I came in here because
I wanted to leave you a note.
I wanted to do it at the end
of the day when there was
nobody here,
because I really didn't
want everybody in this
office to know
that the new girl
has got a big crush
on the boss.
And what was this
little note gonna say?
Well, it was gonna say
that you're wrong,
because there's 17
restaurants in this city
that make the
Hemingway daiquiri.
Who were you talking to
on the phone?
Eddie.
Eddie?
My friend Eddie.
He's a bartender
and he was helping me
put together the list.
I realized that I didn't
remember all 17 bars,
so I was calling him
for help and I--
I'm sorry.
And I'm positive I'm fired.
Get out.
Here. This is the list
of the bars.
Please get--
I'm telling you the truth.
This is what
I was leaving.
You might wanna
check them out.
Hey. This is what you
want me to believe?
That you came in here
for this list?
Yeah.
Okay.
Well, you're fired.
Because I don't wanna
take you to dinner
as your boss.
I mean, maybe I'll rehire you in the
morning or maybe after dessert.
You can tell me all about
this crush you have on the boss.
Okay.
I did that?
Yes, you did that.
Okay, wait, wait, wait.
Where you going?
Wait.
Wait. Wait.
What's the matter?
I've gotta go to the bathroom.
I'll be right back.
All right. Oh!
I'll be right back.
You all right?
All of a sudden
I'm not feeling that good.
I think maybe you
should take me home.
Too much , I think.
Which way are we going?
My exit's back there.
How far are you
prepared to take this?
Say your name.
Go ahead. Just say it.
Katherine.
Bullshit.
Katherine Pogue.
Bullshit.
Bullshit.
Okay. You need to
take me home.
Esmeralda was right.
And I didn't
want to believe her.
You're a spy for
Kirschenbaum, right?
Answer me!
Don't wanna talk?
Well, I'll tell you what.
How about this?
Let's get your pal M
on the phone.
Who the fuck is M?
And why is my name on this text?
Okay.
I'm gonna ask you
one more time.
Are you or are you not a fucking spy?
Yes.
What?
Yes.
Phelps, right?
You and that scumbag
Phelps the whole time.
From the first day. Right?
How much could
they be paying you?
Are they paying you more
than hooker money?
Because that's
what you are, right?
Do you even know what
the word loyalty means?
I bet your wife is wondering
the same thing.
I am so disappointed
in you right now.
But just because you
wanna hurt somebody,
doesn't mean that you will.
Harrison. I'm sorry. I have--
I've never spied on
anybody like this.
Fuck you.
Get out.
MAN:
Bath time.
ROWENA:
Ro, I called you
I called you at H2A, they said
you no longer work there.
On the way to the rehab
center to see my mother.
The last time I spoke to you
was when you tried to jimmy
the lock on Hill's computer.
Do you have any idea of
the thoughts going through
my fucking head?
Hill saw the text message
you sent me last night.
So I guess we won't be getting
Oh, no.
No, no, no.
No, it's okay.
I'll figure something out.
Yeah. I'm good.
Look, can we
have an early dinner tonight?
You can bring your laptop and we'll
start putting the story together?
Okay.
Oh, good. You never say okay,
and that's good. I love okay.
Oh, good.
I'm just glad you're out of there.
Yeah. Me too.
Okay, I'll see you tonight.
Bye.
Phyllis?
Anybody here?
Hello?
Hi, Mom.
You look pretty.
Hello, can I help you?
Oh, yeah, hi.
I'm from IT. I was sent to run
the detox on Mr. Hill's computer.
Fascinating.
Wanna know why?
Nobody called IT.
Well, your
computer did, sir.
When any computer
hooked up to the grid
goes down, it cries for help.
Ah. A cry for help.
Have you tried these?
No.
There's a little honey in the center.
Thank--
I'm Harrison Hill.
Benson comma Kurt.
Interesting name.
Let me ask you something.
Could this have
anything to do
with someone trying to install
spyware on my computer?
Well, it could have
to do with anything,
but I won't know until I give
your computer a clean scrub.
I like a good, clean scrub.
Yeah.
I need about 10 minutes
in my office, but in the meantime,
I'm sure Josie wouldn't mind
showing you around the office.
MILES:
Hello, Josie.
Josie, meet Benson
comma Kurt.
Esmeralda, can I have those
mockups that Gunnar left
someplace, please?
ESMERALDA:
Yes, yes, I know right where it is.
Follow me.
Josie.
Come on, Miles.
Shit.
Beautiful space.
Beautiful people.
Beautiful pictures.
Are those--? Are those planets?
No, eyes. Mrs. Hill
did a whole series:
"Inside the Dilated Eye."
We have
a guest computer.
Take the virtual tour.
It's very informative.
I'll be in my office
if you need me.
Oh, thanks. I got locked out.
ROWENA :
ROWENA:
Miles?
ROWENA:
"Welcome, Trublu"?
MILES: Can I help you?
What the fuck, Miles?
What are you doing in this room?
Well, I heard my voice
coming from your computer.
That's what I'm doing.
It's a joke. That's just a joke.
Oh, it's a joke, huh?
Well, are all these pictures
on this computer a joke?
Are the pictures of me out there
on that goddamn dummy a joke?
Huh? Huh?
You know what,
I'll tell you what's funny.
What's funny is the fact that
you said you hadn't seen Grace,
but yet you got pictures of her
on your computer from October.
Nude pictures, all fucking
chained up and strapped up
and shit.
Hey, can we go in the other
room and talk about this?
No, no, no.
Let's talk about him. Trublu.
Maybe your pal Trublu
took all these pictures.
Maybe Trublu took all these
fucking pictures in here.
You freak.
Wait a minute.
Go ahead, admit it.
Fucking admit it right now.
You were ADEX.
Two or three times, yeah.
Yeah, that's what I thought.
You've been manipulating
this whole thing, haven't you?
Lying to me. Fucking Grace.
Who didn't?
You were trying to set up
Harrison Hill, huh?
Wait a minute.
You think that because of this
that I had something
to do with that?
Why wouldn't I? You can't keep
changing your identity, Miles,
and expect people to trust you.
Don't be such
a fucking hypocrite, Ro.
Fuck you.
No. Fuck you.
I've been working my ass off
on this for you the whole time.
Everybody has secrets, Ro.
Right. Everybody's got secrets, huh?
Until they get caught.
Let's see.
Take a fucking look at something.
You told me to take
the virtual tour of H2A.
When you do,
when you click on the photographs
hanging in the reception area,
it links you
to Mia Hill's webpage.
She took photographs
of dilated eyes, Ro.
They're eyes. Look.
"Mia Rheinhart Hill replicates
a phenomenon fashionable
in the 1920s,
the dilation of a woman's pupils
with the use of belladonna."
This is it. This puts
the poison in his hands,
or it puts the poison
in his wife's hands.
This is it.
This is what
we've been looking for.
You need to get help.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
This is the story.
Can I go now?
ROWENA:
"Veronica. What's new?"
"Boyfriend's out of town."
"Which means?" You tell me.
"Hotel Gansevoort."
ROWENA:
especially the sunrise."
Are you Harrison Hill?
Yeah.
Mr. Hill, I'm gonna need you to put
your hands behind your back.
You're under arrest for
the murder of Grace Clayton.
Who?
"Fast Filly."
You have the right to remain silent
and refuse to answer any questions.
MAN:
Are you aware of
the hundreds of e-mails
between your husband
and other women?
Now I am.
DA:
Mrs. Hill, where do you
keep your belladonna?
MIA:
DA:
We got blood.
DA: And, finally, you will learn
about Grace Clayton,
a young woman
who believed the lies
that this ad man
was selling,
never realizing the price
that she would pay
would be her
own tragic death.
Thank you for your time
and your consideration.
I look forward to your verdict
at the close of this trial.
All over the city, really.
But most often at his hotel suite.
He kept one
at the Gansevoort.
He liked to watch the
sun rise over the city.
He just didn't want his wife to
find out. If she did, it was over.
The hair, blood and secretions
all matched the victim, Grace Clayton.
Additionally, we did find some trace
elements of belladonna extract.
All significant financial
holdings are in the name of
his wife, Mia Rheinhart Hill.
DOORMAN:
It was after midnight on the 5th.
I just started my shift.
This blond woman was freaking out,
wanting to see Mr. Hill.
I buzzed him.
There was no answer.
She left an envelope,
but she wasn't happy.
About an hour later, Mr. Hill came
down, he took the envelope and left.
I didn't see him
the rest of the night.
DA:
I'm holding in my hand a copy
of State's Exhibit Number Three
in evidence, which reads,
"Grace. Don't come by my house.
Don't come by my office.
We are done.
Leave me the fuck alone."
Can you please tell the jury
where this came from?
I retrieved it from Harrison Hill's
hard drive after the police seized
his computer.
ROWENA:
Has the jury reached a verdict?
Yes, we have, Your Honor.
ROWENA:
JUDGE:
Will the defendant please rise?
How do you find on the charge
of murder in the first degree?
ROWENA:
MAN:
Hello, Rowena.
You know how much Daddy
likes bath time.
My great big beautiful girl.
You are so--
Put her down, now.
She needed help.
Isn't that right, Rowena?
Get out.
Oh, you better get out of here.
You put that thing down.
No, I mean it.
Put it down, now.
Do you hear me?
Are you okay, honey?
Are you okay?
Mommy,
he's coming.
I said, get out. Get out.
MILES: She was
blackmailing you, wasn't she?
That's why you did her all
those favors all those years,
even after she slept
with your boyfriend.
You just couldn't
say no, could you?
What was it? What did
Grace know about you?
MOTHER:
We're just gonna tell
people he disappeared.
Like last August.
He just never came home.
He just went away
and he never came home.
You got that?
Rowena, look at me.
You got that?
MILES:
I hated her.
I hated her for you.
I still do.
Rowena.
Grace.
MILES:
You can't just forget people.
Bury them and pretend
like they never existed?
And then she handed
you Hill that night.
She fucking
handed him to you.
Regards to your mother.
At some point, you must
have thought, "This has to end.
This all has to end."
That's how you knew
you could pin it on Hill.
And then that's how
I knew it was you.
You remember that night
at my apartment?
Belladonna is used to dilate eyes.
Are those planets?
No, eyes.
Mrs. Hill did a whole series:
"Inside the Dilated Eye."
MILES:
And then, all you needed
was the belladonna.
And I-- And I
remembered your mother
and that pathetic little
pharmacy they have there...
and how you always used to
complain how understaffed they were.
And it really wasn't that
difficult to get, was it?
to implicate Hill
or his wife.
And then,
all you needed to do was connect
Hill with the physical evidence.
Secrets are great, Ro.
Unless you get caught.
You once told me that all it takes
for the perfect murder
are the right ingredients
at the right time.
So you waited all these years
for everything to line up.
That's fucking beautiful.
That's poetic.
It's almost perfect
except for one little thing.
What are you willing to do
for me to keep me quiet?
Lieutenant Tejada,
it's Rowena Price.
I think we sent the wrong man
to prison. Miles attacked me.
You got to get to my house.
Please.
