It's just...
the children are
my responsibility.
We've been through this before.
These children have been
specially selected.
If my work is a success,
thousands of lives can be saved.
It's not about a few children.
It's about the future
of our species.
Anyway, it's too late
for doubt now.
The process
has already started.
Just do what we agreed.
At 10 P.M.,
you call the police...
and you tell them
the children have disappeared.
Sir, the subjects
have been transported.
Good.
But, sir, there's a problem.
Head count had twenty of them
before transport.
Now we've only got nineteen.
Someone's missing.
Shit!
Good evening, Sheriff.
What's going on, Adams?
There's twenty kids
live at this orphanage.
All twenty of them
have gone missing.
-And then?
-After the power went out...
I went to check
on the children.
Their beds were empty,
every one of them.
They just...
disappeared.
Did you have a nightmare?
My mommy says that there's
nothing to be afraid of...
in the dark.
Your mother's wrong, kid.
Being afraid of the dark
is what keeps most of us alive.
Pinkerton.
Carnby is coming in...
on flight 185
from Buenos Aires.
He's got the artifact.
Intercept him at the airport.
Get the artifact and kill him.
So maybe you're thinking
I'm an asshole...
scaring that kid
for no reason...
but I'm just
trying to protect him.
You see, there's a world
around you...
that you've trained
yourself not to see.
Call it paranormal,
supernatural, occult, whatever.
But inside all of us...
is an uncontrollable fear
of the dark.
Kids are told it's irrational,
but it's not.
Fear is what protects you...
from the things
you don't believe in.
I learned the truth
a long time ago-
just because
you can't see something...
doesn't mean
it can't kill you.
When I was ten,
I lost my memory.
Gone, erased.
I know something bad happened
back then at the orphanage.
I've been looking
for answers ever since.
You don't have to believe me.
My name is Edward Carnby,
and I'm here to protect you...
from the things
you don't believe.
You travel light.
I carry enough baggage
for the both of us. Trust me.
That's funny, man.
What do you do?
You don't want to know.
Sure, I do. That's the best part
of the job, you know-
learning about people's lives.
I'm a paranormal investigator.
Are you fucking serious?
Really?
What does that mean exactly?
Let me put it this way.
I hunt and track down
the strange and unusual.
Speaking of strange
and unusual...
that cab's been following us
since we left the airport.
-No shit?
-No shit.
You want me to lose him?
I wouldn't mind.
Let's do it.
They really want
something from you.
Shit!
That's my cab, man!
My boss is gonna
fucking kill me!
My insurance is not
gonna cover this, man!
Shit!
Pull into this market up here.
And kill someone?
It's a total dream.
Stay down!
You all right?
Where is he?
Hey! Hey!
Miss Cedrac,
we got another delivery.
I don't have anything
scheduled for today.
What museum was it
transferred from?
"For Dr. Hudgens,
from Dr. Hudgens. "
That must be a mistake.
It's probably for
the big Abkani show.
Abkani? What the hell is Abkani?
It's an ancient
Native American civilization.
They were, like,
this super-advanced culture...
until, like, 10,000 years ago,
they just disappeared.
It says it's only to be opened
by Dr. Hudgens.
This is Aline Cedrac.
She's the assistant curator.
We have artifacts coming in
from all around the world.
Until Hudgens gets back...
I will be doing
all his cataloging for him.
Hey, where is Hudgens anyway?
The show opens
in a couple days.
He's off on another
archaeological goose chase.
He thinks he's finally
found the Arabis.
So he sticks you
with all the work.
At least it takes your mind
off your boyfriend, right?
I'll be in my office
if you need me.
Yeah.
They say a sunken ship
is like a grave.
It should never be disturbed.
I've been searching
for the Arabis...
for over twenty years, Captain,
and now that I've found it...
I'm afraid your
ill-informed superstitions...
aren't enough to stop me.
OK, Hudgens,
let's see what we've got.
Edward, it's John here.
I don't know if you're back from
wherever you were this time...
but if you are, call me.
It's the nightmares.
They've started again.
I need to know if it's just me.
Call me, please.
Well, are you going
to open it up...
make sure it's what
you're looking for?
The conditions must be perfect.
Otherwise,
there may be consequences.
Is this made of solid gold?
You know, the Abkani
was the first civilization...
to use gold
to house their valuables.
They believed it held the power
to contain evil spirits.
Nowadays,
we can't even remember...
why we value gold
in the first place.
Let's just load this
on the truck.
If the container
is made of solid gold...
whatever's inside
must be worth a fortune.
Oh, you have no idea.
But I'm looking forward
to finding out.
Listen. Listen!
You'll make a terrible mistake!
The only mistake
I'd be making...
is letting you walk out
with whatever's inside.
Throw him in there!
Please! No!
Open it up, Captain.
Let's see what we've got.
Don't open it!
John?
Oh, God.
What are we looking at,
Krashinski?
Electromagnetics off the scale,
Commander.
I've never seen
anything like it.
Recalibrating
all sensors now, sir.
There's no malfunction, sir.
These are accurate readings.
Jesus Christ.
Hello?
Did a shipment
arrive for me today?
Oh, it's a fascinating piece,
Dr. Hudgens.
I started decoding
the pictograms and-
Who told you to do that?
That crate was not to be opened.
Yeah, but I was only
just gonna catalog it for you.
It's not your place to question
my instructions, miss Cedrac.
Leave the tablet alone.
I'll catalog it myself
when I get back.
But, Dr. Hudgens, I-
Sir, I found them.
Sister Clara,
something's happened.
The others are back.
Yeah.
Edward. Thank God.
Hey, Linda. What's wrong?
It's John.
I woke up, and he's just gone.
All of his clothes are here.
His car's in the garage.
It's like he just got up...
in the middle of the night
and walked out.
I'll be right over.
According to Abkani legend,
when they opened the gate...
between our world
and the world of darkness...
a few people survived
by joining forces...
with the creatures
from the other side.
They gained supernatural power
but lost their humanity.
That would explain the man who
tried to kill me this morning.
I have this bad feeling...
that's what's happened
to John and the others.
Edward, you've known each other
since you were kids.
Did he tell you
he was leaving me?
Of course not.
Then where is he, Edward?
What's going on?
I'll figure this out.
I'll find John. Don't worry.
OK.
Fischer here.
-Hey, Fisch. It's Carnby.
-Edward.
I know it's been a while.
You gotta do me a favor.
I haven't heard from you
since you left 713. What's up?
A friend of mine
who grew up in my orphanage...
disappeared last night.
His name's John Dillon.
Can you try to dig up
some information?
They'll kill me if they
find out, but let me check.
All right. I have to take a trip
down memory lane.
I'll meet you at 3:00
at our old hangout. OK?
-Please take care, Edward.
-I'll see you then.
One, two, three.
Bluebells, cockle shells...
eevie, ivy, over.
I like coffee, I like...
Welcome home, Edward.
Should I make some tea?
Yes. Thank you, Sophie.
Let me look at you.
You've been getting
enough sleep?
Sister, John disappeared
last night, and...
something happened
to me as well.
It's happening again.
I need your help.
I want to find the others.
I'll get their files.
Come on.
It's good to see you, Edward.
You should visit more often.
Yeah, that is very strange, huh?
He just disappeared?
I understand
you must be very concerned.
I'II let you know
as soon as I hear something.
OK, thank you.
I was recruited into Bureau 713
when I was 20.
I learned everything I could
about the paranormal.
I was a good agent...
but it didn't get me
any closer to the truth.
Every time I uncovered
a new Abkani artifact...
it immediately got classified.
I realized I'd never get
the answers I was looking for...
with 713 calling the shots.
Why did I agree to this?
Come on, Fisch.
It's a beautiful day.
I ordered your favorite.
It's pecan, right?
You have a good memory, Carnby.
It's all in the details, right?
I tracked down the three
you asked me about.
They all disappeared last night.
Same story-
no suitcase, no car...
just up and walked out
into the night.
So that means
all nineteen are missing.
I did a full
cross-reference, too.
Nothing much in common...
except they all grew up
in the same orphanage...
your orphanage.
What's going on, Carnby?
That's what I'm trying
to figure out here.
Thanks, Fisch.
I'll see you around.
It's good to know I've still
got friends at the 713.
Miss Cedrac,
there's someone here to see you.
-Edward!
-Oh, God, I missed you.
I thought you were dead,
you asshole.
God.
Just give me five minutes,
all right?
I can explain everything.
In private, Rob.
Oh, I should-
yeah, I'm gonna go.
Give me one reason why I should
ever even speak to you again.
Look at this.
I was in the Amazon
for six weeks...
tracking poachers
across their transport lines.
Then I fell in with a group
of ex-Chilean military...
who were selling artifacts
on the black market.
That was found
on the southern tip of Chile...
in a gold mine.
It's Abkani.
You know,
you could have called...
or even written...
just to let me know
that you were alive.
Do the inscriptions
make any sense to you?
I'm not sure.
The thing is...
they're all from
different locations-
Venezuela,
Newfoundland, Alaska...
and now this one from Chile.
that would have been...
like burying them
at the ends of the earth.
Yeah. But why? If you want
someone to build a puzzle...
why would you hide the pieces
so far apart?
Now what?
Is Rob trying to create a mood
or something?
Give me that.
Hello?
Hello?
Miss Cedrac?
Mr. Carnby?
What the hell's with the lights?
How come every time you show up,
my life gets complicated?
I could ask you the same thing.
What is it?
Nothing. The hair on the back
of my neck just stood up.
Hello?
Did you hear that?
Rob!
Come on! Go! Go!
What the hell was that?
Get down! Come on!
Lock the door!
Get the key in there!
It's our only way
out of here!
Aline!
-You all right?
-Yeah.
Yeah, I'm OK.
I want a full security
sweep of the area.
-Miles.
-Sir?
Call Fischer and tell him
to get his boys down here now.
Let's go!
Move! Move! Move!
Scanners clear?
Scanners clear.
What the hell
are you doing here, Carnby?
Hey, Burke.
Good to see you, too.
You shouldn't be here.
This is my unit now.
You must be very proud.
You used to be able to take care
of yourself there, Carnby.
Got a little soft
since you left 713?
You should take her to the medic
and check that arm.
This way.
I'll catch up.
Why are you still here?
Why am I still here?
I just got my ass chased...
around this goddamn museum
by something I couldn't see.
I want to know
what the hell they are...
what they're doing
in the goddamn city!
I want to know
what 713 knows about it!
You're not 713 anymore, OK?
That information is classified.
That means it's none of
your fucking business!
We've got this under control.
Thank you.
I don't need your help.
Get him out of here, Marko.
I asked very nicely.
Real tough, huh?
All right!
You're right, Burke.
Maybe I have gotten soft.
You just keep walking.
Come on, Miles.
Fucking prick.
Thank you very much, Burke.
-Hey.
-Hi.
-You OK?
-Yeah, I'm fine.
I need to study
those artifacts.
All right.
I'm gonna go and figure out...
what's going on with John
and the others.
We'll hook up later, OK?
Later.
You shouldn't be here, Carnby.
I'm not.
Commander Burke is.
Your curiosity
have anything to do...
with the fingerprint of yours
I found on this corpse?
Fisch, the list of people
I trust is short.
I'm not making it shorter.
Have you I.D.'d him yet?
We got his dentals.
Agent James Pinkerton.
He's ex-713.
What?
You telling me he was an agent?
When?
Went M.I.A. twenty years ago.
His records are so classified,
they're practically invisible.
Why the hell
was he trying to kill me?
This might have something
to do with it.
Fused to the spinal cord.
There's another piece in here.
It's been severed.
Never seen this kind of
symbiosis before.
This must be why his entire
nervous system was compromised.
Scanner's still
giving a reading.
What?
The Abkani never cease
to amaze me.
Such a complex society at a time
when most of humanity...
was hunting and gathering
and huddling around fires.
Dr. Hudgens,
when did you get back?
A few hours ago.
I heard you had some excitement.
Are you all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.
A little shaken up, but I'm OK.
Look, I must apologize
for snapping at you earlier.
But why are you still here,
after all you've been through?
-Where'd you get that image?
-Edward.
That's a major find.
I'll have to analyze that.
Actually, I'll do that myself.
It's not a request.
Where is the artifact?
-Everything OK in here?
-Who are you?
Miss Cedrac's security detail.
My dear,
have you any idea who I am?
Dr. Lionel Hudgens...
former agent,
Science-spy division...
currently 713 advisor status.
I know exactly who you are.
Well, I'll have to hold off
my curiosity till the morning.
Dr. Hudgens.
I meant to ask...
did you finally find the Arabis?
Just an empty shipwreck.
Like you said...
another wild-goose chase.
You've got one inside you, too.
But symbiosis is incomplete.
I was electrocuted
when I was a kid.
That must have killed it.
Can you remove it?
Well, I could try...
but it could paralyze you.
So these organisms
are somehow connected...
to the creatures
from the museum, right?
We call them Zenoes.
Catchy. When did they
first appear?
Two years ago.
They've been 713's
top priority ever since.
But it's been almost exclusively
in rural areas.
This sort of urban infiltration
is unheard of.
Have you isolated
any weaknesses?
They're vulnerable
to elements 76 to 79-
osmium, iridium,
platinum, and gold...
negates their ability
to disrupt electricity.
If they disrupt electricity...
how come my flashlight
still worked?
Well, the closer the current is
to its power source...
the less the disruption.
Now, this has been calibrated
to track their disruption field.
It won't help you see them...
but it'll let you know
when they're nearby.
They live almost
exclusively in the dark.
Sunlight is lethal
in large doses.
But only certain
light frequencies can hurt them.
These lamps have been set
to an effective frequency.
But for maximum damage,
we use bullets...
coated in a photon-accelerated
luminescent resin.
Cuts right through them.
I'm gonna need a lot of these.
The man who attacked me
yesterday...
was after the Abkani artifact
I found in Chile.
He was driven by the same force
that controls the creatures.
The Zenoes at the museum
were after the same thing.
It can't be a coincidence...
John and the others
have also gone missing.
I'm close to the truth.
I know it.
But whoever
controls these things...
is going to send more after me.
Commander Burke
wants to see you.
I heard you met with Carnby.
Why?
Well, he has intel we need.
I trust him.
You trust him. Right.
We need to trust
each other, Fischer.
I mean, I need to know
whose side you're on.
Or I can just remove you
from the unit...
and you and Carnby
can hang out anytime you want.
You can grab a pizza,
go to the movies.
What is it you need from me?
I need all the intel
you have on Edward Carnby...
and I need you
to keep your mouth shut.
You understand me?
I do.
I'll get it.
Sara?
Sara?
Oh, God. Sara!
Yes. Yes.
Now you're with us.
It seems all the pieces
fit together.
Now I need your help
to figure out why.
With the pieces
assembled like this...
maybe the computer
can plot a location...
based on the symbols
matching these constellations.
So, what are we
looking for exactly?
The Abkani
used constellations...
to pinpoint
a geographic location...
but I don't think
we could zero in...
more than maybe
a 100-mile radius.
-Edward.
-Yeah?
If this is correct...
I think the computer
can pinpoint the location.
That's right in our area,
isn't it?
Shit.
Here.
Stay there.
John? John?
Shit. John, it's me.
It's Edward.
Aline, come on! Come on!
This way! This way!
Come on! Come on!
Come on! This way!
We better get out of here.
Come on.
-I just killed John.
-What do you mean?
He was one of them.
Something was controlling him.
Then you had no choice.
How many more are there?
There were twenty of us.
Shit.
Krash, Alpha Unit reporting.
Body count at six dead.
Please alert meds.
How many casualties we got?
Nine so far, sir.
We're still getting
some sort of readings.
Stand fast.
Carnby, drop your weapon!
On the ground now!
Burke, just in the nick of time,
as usual.
I know you're infected.
I'm taking you in.
Are you kidding me?
What's the first rule
they teach you at 713, huh?
Trust your instincts, right?
You really think
I'm one of these creatures?
I said drop your fucking weapon!
Hey, Burke!
Krash, this is Cheung.
We're on the upper level.
Cheung, I'm reading
four signatures.
They're moving to surround you.
Possible ambush.
I'm routing backup
from the lower level.
Proceed with extreme caution.
Where the hell is our backup?
Cheung, reinforcements have
engaged targets in stairwell.
You're on your own.
Hold your fire!
Any others?
Scanner's clear.
Krash?
All heat signatures motionless.
Clear. Repeat-you are clear.
-Let's move out.
-Yes, sir.
I need a body count.
Do not touch any bodies.
Meds, cleanup, and Science-spy
will be there momentarily.
Commander Burke,
we have got a new development.
All available agents
are being rerouted...
to an abandoned gold mine
in your sector.
Scan is picking up
multiple Zenoe signatures...
converging on the location.
You have been assigned
field command of the operation.
Proceed there immediately.
Will one of you tell me
what the hell's going on here?
We picked up massive readings.
That's not what I asked.
What the hell is going on here?
Look, Fischer's missing.
So is Hudgens.
I got a feeling
this is just the beginning.
What does Hudgens
have to do with this?
That's what I want to find out.
I'll brief you both in the air.
Let's go.
Krash, I'm gonna get this place
locked up now.
Science-spy is on the way,
Commander.
Oh, and, Carnby...
I'll need my I.D. back.
Let's move it.
Let's keep that access open.
Move it! Move it!
Move it! Move it! Come on!
So, where are we going, Burke?
To the Britannia gold mine.
The Britannia mine?
I grew up in that area.
Why are we going there?
They shut it down
after six miners were killed
in an unexplained accident.
Did 713 investigate?
The report concluded there was
no paranormal activity.
But get this-
the agents in charge
of the investigation...
were Dr. Lionel Hudgens
and James Pinkerton.
Let's go!
Krash, what are your readings?
Practically off the scale,
Commander.
This is unprecedented.
Initiate 59-Alpha.
No. Hold them off for now.
Wait for my command.
We've got three guerillas
with flashlights set up...
gatling guns with
electromagnetic motion tracking.
And every available agent
in the vicinity is here-
Look, I don't care
what you have to do.
Get more bodies down here now!
Look at this place!
We need more!
Looks like we're going to war.
Yeah? Well, we are.
Highest Zenoe concentration ever
is in this area.
It's our chance to get
rid of them once and for all.
Come on!
Turner.
Come on.
Turner, why is that thing
not up and running?
Just arrived here, sir.
The generator
will be online shortly.
Got to move faster.
This is top priority.
-I need it up.
-Yes, sir.
Carnby.
All the readings I'm getting
from outside are huge.
The stuff I'm getting
from down there...
I've never seen
anything like it before.
What's going on?
This is where we need to go.
They're all coming here
for a reason.
Until we know what that is...
we're not gonna be able
to stop them.
So we go in?
Yeah.
-Miles.
-Sir.
-Defend the perimeter.
-Yes, sir.
Raise it up.
Need to go higher.
Turner,
where's the genny at right now?
Any minute now.
Just back off, Miles.
Come on, Turner.
We need those lights, all right?
We need the power. Let's go.
Yeah, yeah.
Shit!
Move on it! Let's go!
We have confirmation.
Perimeter defenses up.
Still waiting for the genny
to come back on line.
Roger that.
All agents, Britannia operation
in code yellow.
All units in place
and standing by...
for genny to come online.
Misfire. Misfire.
No engagement. Hold your fire.
Repeat-hold your fire.
Krash, any updates?
Perimeter defenses in place,
Commander.
Copy that.
Looks like it's a dead-end.
I'll go check it out.
Turner, you said five minutes
ten minutes ago.
Come on.
Where the hell are the lights?
I got it. I got it.
About fucking time.
Miles.
Readings are stable, sir.
Another dead-end.
Maybe we should double back
and try another tunnel.
No, no, no.
There's got to be
something else here.
Look at this.
It's Abkani.
There's more over here.
I think I found something.
-Marko!
-Marko!
We've got to go down there.
Let's move, people.
How long do we have
to hold them?
Only till dawn.
-That's four hours away, sir.
-That's right.
Incoming!
Electromagnetics around the mine
are off the scale.
Getting too much interference.
Satellite intel is compromised.
Tracking multiple
Zenoe clusters in the area...
mostly centered at...
Fischer, no!
Sir, the generator's gone!
Hold your fire till they reach
the second perimeter.
Commander,
They're already en route.
What is your status?
Can you read me?
Yeah. We're retrieving Marko.
Tell them to hurry up,
goddamn it.
Hold your fire.
Hold your fire.
Hold your fire
till they hit the perimeter.
-Fire!
-Fire!
Faster. Come on.
Oh, God! Help!
Aline!
Hang on! Hang on!
I got you!
Grab ahold!
Get your footing!
Go! Go! Go! Go!
Come on! Move faster!
Come on!
Come on!
Get down there! Jump!
Burke, I'm stuck!
What? Cheung, lay down.
Lay down.
Barr, get over here.
I'm gonna keep pressure
on the wound.
I need you to wrap this now.
Relax.
Everything's gonna be fine.
-Gunships approaching.
-Richards.
Richards, do you copy?
Richards?
All right, Feenstra.
Check on Richards.
Copy that.
I don't think
we're supposed to be here.
You guys, check this out.
It's a warning.
What's the warning?
It says once you make it
down here alive...
you're already dead.
That's comforting.
Miles! Miles!
Burke, go again.
I'm trying to find
a way out of here.
Miles, Krash, anyone.
Burke, go again.
Krash!
Are you getting anything?
Nothing.
I'm getting nothing but static.
Change your frequency.
Try again.
Burke, Miles, come in.
Fall back! Fall back!
We've got to get out of here.
We've got to get out.
Jesus!
Aline!
I got it!
Watch it! Watch her legs!
Watch out!
Shoot it! Shoot it!
Right there!
More?
Aw, Jesus.
She's gone.
Shit.
Burke, come on. She's gone.
Come on.
We've got to find a way out.
Come on! Let's move!
Miles, Richards is dead.
Everyone's dead!
All right,
find some high ground.
I'm gonna stay here. Go.
Go!
Watch your back.
Burke.
Something tells me we're not
the first ones down here.
-Let's blow it, Barr.
-Yes, sir.
Let's go.
Feenstra!
God.
Carnby.
It's 713.
They implanted us
with those things.
This isn't happening.
It doesn't make any sense.
We've been trying
to stop something...
that they created
the whole time.
My guys are dying out there
for nothing!
For fucking nothing!
Goddamn it!
Sir.
You guys, come here.
What's going on?
Aline, give me the artifact.
Yeah.
It's a key.
This could be
our only way out of here.
The answers I've been
looking for my whole life...
could be on the other side
of this thing.
Some doors are meant
to stay shut.
What do you want to do, Carnby?
I say...
we trust the Abkani.
Drop your weapons!
Now move away from the door!
Do it!
Put them down!
You son of a bitch.
Guns on the floor now!
That's good. That's good.
Now get in here.
Does this place
bring back memories, Carnby?
You were my last failure here.
If you hadn't escaped...
shut down my experiments.
I spent twenty years looking
for the key to that door!
Now give it to me!
Give it to me!
No? What a pity.
You were a fine archaeologist.
Aline, just give it to him.
There's been
enough killing today.
That's fine. Right.
Now get over there!
You never could have
opened the door, you know...
not without this.
Hudgens.
Don't be insane.
Don't open that door.
Hudgens, please,
think about what you're doing.
Don't open that door!
Shit.
All right, let's just...
back up nice and easy,
nice and slow.
Go. Go.
Go, go, go!
Shit.
Come on!
Come on! This way! Come on!
Commander Burke.
Miles. Richards.
Yonek.
Or any operations. Over.
Can anyone read me?
Shit.
Come on! Go, go! Run!
Hey! There's a ladder up here!
How's it look?
It looks like
it could be a way out.
All right. I'm pulling.
-Fuck. Fuck!
-What is it?
Detonator's inactive.
The signal’s not going through.
We'll find another way.
Let's get out of here!
I've got to get back there.
I've got to get closer to them.
You can hear them!
Let's get the hell out of here!
Let's go! Come on!
You guys get out of here.
I'm going back.
Burke, come on!
Burke!
Come on!
They were under us
the whole time.
I don't believe it.
Sister Clara?
The gate was closed again.
But, like the Abkani discovered
there's a price to pay...
for bringing darkness
into the light.
The Abkani people were wiped
off the face of the earth.
And now...
it looks like it's happening
all over again.
