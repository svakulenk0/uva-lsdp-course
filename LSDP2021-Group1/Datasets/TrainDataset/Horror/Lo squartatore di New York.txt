Come on, Bessy!
Come on.
Come on.
Gotta sniff everything
in sight, huh?
Well, I can't blame ya,
cooped up all day.
Yeah. It feels good
to get out, don't it?
Yeah. Eight hours behind
a counter's no fun either.
Here. Wanna get some exercise?
My bones.
See this? Fetch it!
Go on.
Take it. Take it.
Attagirl. Attagirl.
Bring it. Come on.
Come on. Good girl.
Good girl, Bessy.
That's my girl. You ready?
Go fetch it again!
Go on!
Look for it.
You find it? Huh?
Take it.
Attagirl. Good girl.
Now bring it here.
Come on.
Ah, I'm so proud of you.
That's it. That's it.
You're such a good girl.
Lieutenant.
Here's your photo
of the Brooklyn Bridge girl.
Pete, give me that file, will ya?
Now glance casually
over at the desk there.
Don't fall in love all at once.
That's the girl's landlady-
Mrs. Weissberger.
Mrs. Weissberger,
I'm Lieutenant Williams.
This the girl?
Oh, yes, Lieutenant.
That's her, all right.
Well, she doesn't look
a bit like a-
What I mean to say is
that in real life she was
much prettier- a real doll.
Poor thing. She was
murdered, wasn't she?
I'll ask the questions,
if you don't mind,
Mrs. Weissberger.
Uh, when did you last
see this girl, um, Ann Linn?
That was her name, right?
No. That's her working name-
her "nomay" de "plumee" or whatever.
Good gracious. If I was as beautiful
as she was, I wouldn't mind
people knowing my real name.
She was a model, you know.
Exotic poses and so on. Um-
She had it all.
She was destined for the big time.
Well, I won't bend your ear
any more, Lieutenant,
but the last time I saw her
was, um, last Friday.
That was, um, exactly six days ago.
Got an aspirin?
Second drawer down.
She had left her apartment at 7:00.
I remember that because
I had just turned on Dallas.
You know, that TV series
about that family that has money...
coming out of its ears.
Well, it was just 7:00,
and she got this telephone call
from this, um, person.
Strangest voice I ever heard.
Sort of like a duck.
- Like a duck?
- Quack, quack, quack.
Just like that.
Not that he said
"quack, quack, quack,"
but that was the tone.
And he made an appointment
to meet her.
Yeah, huh?
How come you heard the phone call?
Well, um,
my phone's on the blink,
and sometimes it rings
together with Ann's.
So I answer, of course,
and happen to listen in.
Not that I pry. God forbid.
God forbid.
Thank you very much,
Mrs. Weissberger.
You've really been a great help,
and I appreciate it no end.
Now, if we need you again,
we'll call, okay?
She was murdered, wasn't she?
Eleven people a day
are murdered here in Fun City,
and over half of them are women.
Good-bye.
Good-bye, Mrs. Weissberger.
Dd
Oh.
Goddamn it!
Why can't you watch
where you're goin'?
I'm sorry. I was thinking of Boston.
The bar only streaked it.
It'll rub off in a second.
You women should stay home
where you belong.
You're a menace to the public.
And you've got
the brains of a chicken.
And you're an asshole. Ciao.
If they don't have
a weight specifications slip,
they don't board. Period.
They say they've always been
allowed on without it.
Well, then they can wait
for a ferry-
Morning.
Morning.
Where the captain doesn't
care about regulations. I do.
Three minutes late.
Well, he deserves it.
It'll wash right off with a little water.
Please. You're not
a police officer, are ya?
I wouldn't think of, uh-
Anyway, uh, my name's Rosie.
Yeah. It's a lot more
convenient when bicycling.
It's great on Staten Island.
Stupid. Is that all you can think of?
-
-
-
-
-
-
How about over here?
Here we go.
Get that idiot down there
at the end movin'.
You in that VW down there.
Get that car movin'.
Go on. Get movin'.
Move! Go on.
Go on.
Dd
Dd
Barry.
Barry.
What?
So, what's the good news?
He used a blade.
He stuck it up her joy trail
and slit her wide open.
He could've done
a slightly better job...
if he'd had more time.
But overall, it was, uh,
good, efficient butchery.
-
Sex?
- Strange. No trace.
Dd
Any ideas?
Dd
I've seen hundreds of girls...
in very bad shape, you know.
But this young lady-
Dr. Barry Jones to hematology, please.
What's so special about her?
You remember that-
that girl that they found
five or six weeks ago?
That model?
Ann Linn?
Same exact style.
I'd bet my dentures she was-
she was done in
by the same guy.
A lefty...
with a yen for slashing up
young ladies.
Another.
Anyway, maybe I have something
that might interest you.
Ah?
I found traces of another
blood group mixed with hers.
Probably our murderer's.
Sam.
Samuel, may I have the file
with the- All right.
What the hell's the matter now?
- Hmm.
- Well, well, well.
If it isn't the big
chief person himself.
Hello, Fred. Listen, Fred.
I want a word with you,
and it's kind of hush-hush.
Uh, is there, uh,
someplace we could talk
without being disturbed?
Sure. How about the church
across the street?
Fred. Fred. Have you
flipped out, or are you
trying to give me an ulcer?
A smart-ass coroner comes out,
what with a little verbal diarrhea,
and you immediately
go around declaring
there's a maniac loose in the city.
Yeah? So, what would you rather I say?
A Boy Scout's been starting to
whittle on little girls with his knife?
For Christ's sake, don't get me wrong.
I don't want to cramp your style.
But could you use a little discretion
when you say things?
Papers follow up on this,
it might start a panic, you know.
You don't wanna create
another Atlanta, do ya?
Try and see it my way, Fred.
Yeah. All right, all right.
Hmm. Well, let's hope
this was just an isolated case.
Tell me, uh, why did you
exclude the car owner?
Do you expect a serious answer
to your question, or do you
wanna hear a funny story?
You think that nerd
who, when he found her,
went to bawl in a men's room...
could have ripped a girl's
guts out on a crowded ferry?
Calm down a minute, Fred.
At what point are you
in the case?
Well, I sent some of
the murderer's blood
down to the boys at the lab.
Ah.
They put it through
the hemo sniffer.
The answer they came up with
is it could be any one
of a million people.
Hmm.
What we do know is that
he's, uh, between-
Maybe. Maybe he's between
all his life in New York.
Hmm. And do you have
a plan of action?
Huh?
No, I do not know
what I'm gonna do.
Maybe- Maybe I'll go to a shrink
and get a psychological profile
on this nut.
It may narrow the field a bit,
and, uh, I may get a clue.
Yeah. I'm sure
that's probably a good idea.
The important thing
though, Fred,
is that New Yorkers believe
we have the situation
firmly under control,
that the metropolitan force
is an example of
perfect efficiency.
Got it?
Mm-hmm.
Keep in touch, will ya, Fred?
Lieutenant.
Hey. Somebody
called for ya.
Yeah? Who?
Guy with a strange voice.
He said he'd call back.
Sounded just like a duck.
Like a duck.
Where have I heard that before?
Don't tell me you're
thinking of beating me.
It's open.
Just a minute.
I'm looking for Dr. Davis.
What's the problem?
Well, my problem is that
I want to talk to Dr. Davis.
That one you've solved.
Yeah. That figures.
- You were expecting-
-
An old coot with silver temples
and a German accent.
How unimaginative
you policemen can be.
It's about that maniac who loves to
slash young girls to death, right?
How did you guess that?
I eat oodles of carrots.
Never mind. Let's get to the point.
You want me to collaborate
on the case, don't you?
Yeah. More or less.
I figure if I'm up
against a maniac,
I might as well have
some, uh, expert help.
Who's paying?
Huh?
It's a fine art- hedging.
The truth is I'm quite busy,
and, um,
the time I'd dedicate to you
I'd have to take away
from my other work.
I expect the administration
will be able to raise enough
money to meet your fee.
Got any idea what
a genius costs per hour?
No, no. I just know
what's in my paycheck.
Okay. You let me have
all the data, and...
we wait for him
to butcher another girl.
- So you think he's gonna
do it again, huh?
- If he's a serious nut, sure.
Live show.
Dd

Live show.
Fuck show?

Oh. This damn place.
Shit.
That fucking asshole, idiot Joe.
Joe?
Come out of there.
Joe?
Son of a bitch.
Hello.
Is Lieutenant Williams there?
Huh?
Is Lieutenant Williams there?
What are you saying?
Lieutenant Williams!
Just a minute. Hold on.
Hey, you.
Go away.
Oh!
Yeah?
It's for you.
Me?
Are you, or aren't you
Lieutenant Williams?
Yeah?
Am I bothering you, Williams?
Dd
Who is this?
Tell the truth.
You were shooting your load
with that whore of yours, weren't you?
Who the hell are you?
Can't you guess, Williams?
Now you got it, huh? Surprise!
I gotta tell you somethin'.
It happened again.
It happened again tonight.
Oh, she was beautiful.
Too beautiful.
She asked for it,
and I gave it to her.
But you wouldn't understand.
You could never understand.
You're too stupid.
Who was it? What a voice!
Make me some coffee, will ya?
Sweetheart, I'm a prostitute,
not your wife.
You want coffee,
you make it yourself.
Do you ever tell
anybody I come here?
What?
Oh, don't be a dumb bitch.
You know what I mean.
Hey. Easy does it, huh?
I take my profession seriously.
My clients all remain anonymous.
I tell you a lot of things,
but have I ever
mentioned a name? Huh?
Then how does that son of a bitch
know that I'm here?
Yeah.
Dd
Dd
Darling.
Yeah?
Dd
I'm going out.
Do you mind if I take the Porsche?
Go ahead. Go right ahead.
I'm not working
down at the hospital today.
In fact, uh,
I have to talk over
some business with,
uh, Charlie Robson.
We're having lunch
at the club.
Enjoy yourself.
Hmm?
Thanks.
Jane.
Yes, darling?
Make plans for tonight.
I'm sure you'll find
something to do.
Sorry, but...
I, uh- I'll be busy.
Don't worry, darling.
I had a feeling.
I already have
something going
for the evening.
Don't work too hard.
Well,
I think by now...
I know every one
of these phone calls
from your friend inside out.
So?
And so I have come
to three conclusions.
One: He's quite good at, uh,
concealing his real personality,
which means total self-control.
Two-
He wants to provoke you.
And, uh,
that's probably got
something to do with his motives.
And three:
Our man,
though a voyeur, a peeper,
likes to be noticed.
Neurotic and egotistical.
Mm-hmm.
Ten million people in this city,
that's a hell of a lot to go on, huh?
Yeah. I grant you.
But- But at least we know
he's not content just to-
to murder his victims at random.
And you can be quite sure
that we're up against
a very superior mind.
No, not so hard. Try again.
Dd
Shit.
You gotta line your eye
down the cue.
Wait. I wanna show you something.
From here.
Dd
In the side pocket.
Right. Watch.
Dd
Hey, Morales.
You ask me,
they're pure silk.
Shit. That pussy ain't got nothin' on.
No underpants?
That ain't clean.
Who cares, man?
When a twat is hot,
it's more comfortable.
Wanna bet?
Okay.
A beer.
One beer.
I was wrong.
Though she don't need
nothin' on the pussy.
Got all that natural fur.
Senora, I tell you what.
I buy you a beer,
and my friend
take you for a ride.
Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.
- You like it, huh?
- Not really.
Take- Take-
Take your foot away.
You like it, right?
Hey, Chico. She likes it.
Oh, yes. You like it, baby.
You love it. Hear that, Chico?
She loves it.
Yeah.
Mmm!
Please stop it.
Stop it.
She loves it.
Please let me go.
She's not moving though, is she?
Here. Drink.
Toma, baby.
Si.
Oh, yes.
Tell me that you like it.
No.
Tell us, baby. You love it.
You don't want me
to let you go, do you?
You want more. More.
Open up.
Right.
Wide. That's it.
- Get nice and wet.
-
Morales got silver toes.
Didn't I tell you she loves it?
Oh, you're beautiful, baby.
Tell me you love it.
You like it.
Go on. Say it.
- Say it.
-
-
- Tell me you like it.
I like it.
I like it.
- The lady likes it!
- Oh!
Silver toes!
Fay.
Fay.
Fay.
-
-
-
-
What's goin' on?
Get up. You've got your hat, don't you?
I'm right here.
Whoo! Missed again!
-
-
Oh! I got you, varmint!
Keep your head down!
Unhand me, sir.
-
-
Nurse Carter to the switchboard, please.
You have a phone call.
Nurse Carter to the switchboard.
Dr. Sanders to Operating Theater 2.
Wow.
Dr. Sanders to Theater 2.
Must have been
a terrible experience.
Yeah. But you'd be
surprised how many people
it happens to every day.
You're kidding.
Hello, darling.
For God's sake.
Well, tell me what happened.
It- It was awful.
It was completely unreal.
God. How's it possible?
W-Was he trying to rape you?
I don't know.
My head is still spinning.
The police asked me
a bunch of questions.
I thought I'd die, Peter.
How do you feel now?
Were you injured at all?
My legs feel sore.
I'm not sure.
The worst thing wa-
about it was-
Shh. Don't think about it.
No.
It's all over now.
No.
N-No. I've got to-
got to tell you something.
Later.
No. I've got to
tell you now.
After I was attacked,
I must have had a-
some sort of nightmare.
I was in this empty movie house,
watching cartoons,
but like hallu- hallucinations.
And then you came in and killed me.
Yes. You were the murderer, darling.
What do you think?
I don't know.
The girl is still pretty shook-up.
Sounded very confused.
I'll tell you one thing though,
for what it's worth.
If the, uh, guy who attacked her
is our friend who talks like a duck,
well, he just committed
his first big mistake.
Yeah.
Anyway, all five boroughs
are on the watch.
We'll also hoot it
over the radio stations.
Shouldn't be too hard
to find a guy with two fingers
missing on his right hand.
Want a ride?
No, thanks.
I think I'll take a stroll.
Okay.
Keep in touch.
Mm-hmm.
L- I think I know why...
I dreamt that you killed me.
Yeah. Because of those...
terrible things...
I said about Susie.
I'm sorry, darling.
Forgive me?
There's nothing to forgive.
Don't worry about it.
You're not just saying it?
I've got to know
that you believe me, Peter.
I'm so scared of
what's going on inside me.
Well, of course I do.
But I also believe that reality
is a hell of a lot more dangerous
than a dream.
The truth is, you escaped
from a crazy son of a bitch...
who's murdered
three women already.
You were very lucky.
What did the police have to say?
They wanted to know
all about the guy...
who followed me in the subway.
What was he like?
Oh, strange, weird.
Eyes that kind of-
of looked through you, like-
And then he had two fingers
missing on his right hand.
Dd
Dd
Dd
Dd
Mikis here.
Yeah, of course.
We're over here at my place.
I'm telling ya, this broad's
more kinky than a circus freak.
Yeah,
all packaged and ready to go.
Oh, yeah, she's, uh,
right up your perverted alley.
This one? This one here?
All right, sir.
There we are.
And a paper.
Here you go.
That'll be three dollars.
Have a nice evening.
I don't know if it's come out yet.
Oh, I don't wanna miss this!
Geez.
You want it? Take it.
Dd
Dd
Don't you dare touch that dial.
This is Big Phil Burrows, everybody.
I'm gonna cry, whip and wail,
plus I got a thousand messages for y'all.
But first of all, I wanna ask
that dude with two fingers
missing on his right hand...
a big question.
Man, why, baby?
Please leave the ladies alone.
Ripper, leave 'em alone.
Dd
Dd
This is Big Phil Burrows
with Night Sounds,
and at 04:16 a.m. I wanna
dedicate this next number to-
to all of those young lovers who've,
uh, hey, got that conquest almost in the bag.
Maybe you made it,
but ya just can't let that wild chick go.
Dd
Dd
Dd
Oh!
-
-
I'm sorry if I couldn't give you
any better welcome, Lieutenant.
Yeah, well, I quite understand.
I'm sorry to trouble you.
Tell me, Dr. Lodge,
how well did you know your wife?
Jane was an adorable wife,
a perfect mate.
I knew her quite well,
Lieutenant,
and believe me, there'll never be
anyone to take her place.
Nothing could fill the void.
Dd
Dd
My wife is dead, Lieutenant,
and you ought to be
intelligent enough to realize that-
That certain relationships are based on-
on mutual trust and freedom.
- My wife lived without any bonds-
- Yeah, I know, I know.
Yeah, I heard all that before-
without prejudice, uh, without taboos.
Your wife was free to live
and free to die.
Anyway, thanks.
Thanks?
Yeah, because of your little hobby here
we now know the, uh, Ripper's identity.
Mikis Kalenda, a Greek.
The night clerk at the fleabag
picked him outta the mug file.
Now it's your turn!
Didn't realize you were so
high-strung and emotional, Heather.
Paul, you're such an asshole sometimes.
You know that?
You're snooping at my desk,
and I'm the asshole, hmm?
Listen, those profiles
Jennifer asked for the other day-
Have you done anything about them?
I stuck them in her fat little hands
this morning.
For once, on time.
Does that rate me
a relaxing lunch at Barney's?
Relaxing?
This New York Ripper case
is taking up so much of my time,
I've almost forgotten what eating is.
With the crummy teacher's salary I get,
I have to moonlight.
It becomes a vicious circle.
Mmm, you're telling me.
Paul, tell me,
how is it you picture this ripper?
Well-
Young, intelligent,
affable,
undoubtedly from a good family.
He has only one
minor defect.
And you know what?
He hasn't chosen you
to be a victim yet.
Ha, ha, ha.
A real warning: Don't accept rides
from anyone with two fingers
missing on his right hand.
Okay?
D47-8-9 here. D47-8-9.
They still haven't answered
the door, Mike. Over.
Keep trying, and call in
as soon as you've got something.
I don't know!
I don't know where he is!
The guy is always
coming and going.
He does what he wants.
How the hell should I know where he is?
Every time he comes in
there's always some mess,
some kind of problem.
He still owes me two months' rent,
the son of a bitch,
plus the $200 I lent him!
I just can't take this anymore!
You won't find anything here.
Why don't you just go and leave me alone?
Yeah.
You have no right to-
to bully a law-abiding citizen.
Look what you've done
to my apartment.
God!
I can't take any more!
What the hell
do you want from me?
I haven't done anything!
Why don't you leave me alone?
Exhibit "A"...
and Exhibit "B."
Our friend really
must be a weirdo, huh?
Yeah, that's what Davis said.
Okay, sweetheart,
when did you last see Nice Boy?
What is it,
you fellas all deaf or something?
I've told you
it was last Monday or Tuesday.
I don't recall.
He's out with a whore
shacking up somewhere.
I don't know what the hell
girls see in that guy.
Trouble is,
they only get to see him once.
Careful, careful.
I couldn't take that hospital
a second longer.
I was going out of my mind.
Yeah,
hospitals are a real drag.
And besides,
I kind of like the idea...
of coming here
to your house for a while...
And being cuddled
and comforted by you.
Well, if you don't behave
and rest up your bones
just a little,
you'll never get back in shape.
I thought you wanted to win
some gold at Los Angeles.
Eh, Miss National Champ?
There's plenty of time yet.
Now I'll just take it easy
and get some love
and understanding.
You're pigheaded.
How many times do I have to-
Look, you know darn well
the problem is my leg, not my head.
The brain's fine.
It's the brawn.
It takes more than talent
to win, honey.
You've got to have willpower.
Mmm. Yeah.
You lack it.
In this country,
if you’re not good at something,
at anything,
if you’re not the best,
the smartest or the toughest, that's it.
You're screwed.
You won't get anywhere.
Well, how's your leg?
Clinically it's healed,
but I've got to tone up the muscles.
Uh, we were just gonna make coffee.
Care for some?
No, thanks.
I won't be staying too long.
Mathematician?
Physicist. I'm doing research
on entropy at absolute zero.
Hmm. Interesting.
Good chess player too, I bet.
Now, why have I come here
to bother you?
Be nice to know.
Uh, are you absolutely certain...
that the guy who attacked you
was Mikis Kalenda?
Why? What do you mean?
You don't believe me?
Just asking once more.
What do you mean, not now?
Don't give me any of that crap, man.
You better just do what I ask.
I've got all the pigs in the city
on my ass.
All right.
I'll be back in a little while.
You need anything?
No, only you, baby.
Sometimes I wonder
how a girl like you,
with an I.Q. Of 182,
could be such a dummy.
It's you, baby.
Your overpowering touch
shorts out my brain circuits.
Okay, see you in a flash.
It'd be better not to open the door
to anybody. You never know.
Don't worry. I'll watch the property,
and if anybody comes, I'll bark.
-
-
You know, I have so many doubts
about Fay Major's testimony.
There's something fishy
about it.
Too many gaps,
as if, uh, she were
holding out on us.
Come on, now, all we need
to nail Mikis Kalenda in court...
is that tape of his bout
with Jane Foster Lodge.
Professor,
could you sign this?
Yeah.
It was his fourth victim,
right?
Yeah.
But look at
this Kalenda character.
He's a guy who lives just for sex,
a 42nd Street gigolo.
The phone calls,
on the other hand-
Yeah, the phone calls indicate
a very intelligent personality...
with a refined cultural
family background.
Come on. We know he's our guy.
All the rest is malarkey shit,
just for experts like you, not me. Okay?
However, to paraphrase Verlaine,
in subtlety lies the essence of things.
Bullshit.
"Memorial Hospital"?
Bitch!
Oh, no!
Why?
Fay!
-
- Fay!
You're a pretty lucky little lady.
I mean, that's the second time
that the Ripper's missed you.
If it weren't for Peter though,
this time I don't know.
And if you cops hadn't stopped me
for a routine check,
I would have been here a lot earlier.
Yeah, well, I'm sorry, but a lot of cops
are out there day and night stopping cars,
trying to catch that bastard.
Then again, it was you who said you'd
take care of her, that she should stay here
in your house where she'd be safer.
That's, uh- That's what I thought.
But I had to go out.
Anyway, if anything else happens,
you, um- you call me right away. Okay?
Good night.
To all units in sector 9-8.
To all units in sector 9-8.
R9-4-4 and 2-6.
R9-4-4 and 2-6.
This is a general
for all units in sector 9-8.
Calling D47. 9-2-6 at 7-2-3.
I have a report of a car theft in zone 12.
Whoever is near it, please take it.
All D47's, clear out of 1-2-5.
Z-M-X is green.
I repeat, Z-M-X is green.
E-Z Zebra 104, we are airborne.
Radio link is operative.
What time he say he'd call?
Quarter after 8:00, supposedly.
He say anything else?
Did he!
He said you were in for
quite a surprise, Lieutenant.
I'll have a surprise for that son of a bitch
if he ever does call.
- You said it.
-
Lieutenant Williams, please.
Here we go.
Lieutenant Williams?
Speaking. What do you want?
To dedicate a killing to you.
I'm gonna sacrifice a woman
just for you. Like the idea?
The only thing I'd like-
I'd really like-
is to meet you face to face.
That'll happen sooner or later,
but you'll have to recognize me.
In the meantime, allow me
to make you this special offering.
-
- We're just about there. One minute more.
It's somewhere down
on the Lower West Side, fifth sector.
Start moving in on the Lower West Side.
Yeah.
A cop getting
a gift of this kind.
Thanks.
However, you disappoint me, Duck.
You throw a challenge my way,
and you don't have the guts to let me
get there to watch the goings-on.
You wait till it's all over.
For the moment
you'll have to be content
with seeing the results only.
In person though!
E-Z Zebra 104 radio link.
Proceed to sector docks 14.
Roger, Base. We're on our way!
I almost forgot
the most important part.
A friend of yours says hello.
Right, Kitty?
Kitty says right.
Got it!
The harbor. A phone booth
sitting right near Pier 11!
I'll get out the A.P.B.!
Move, you bastard.
D47's 3-0-5 and 4-7-1,
flush the south entrance to D-U-X 14.
E-Z Zebra 104, proceed now!
Yeah, I got it all! D-U-X 14 now!
I've got the boathouse spotted.
Good. Stay put.
D-47, 0-941.
Follow Lieutenant Williams's car!
E-Z Zebra 104 to Base.
How long do we have to stay up here?
Can you hold on for 10 minutes?
Make it five.
Okay, I'll get back to you
in five minutes.
D473-0-5 and 4-7-1,
plug up south entrance to D-U-X 14.
Seven minutes and 22 seconds.
Record time! Congratulations!
Tell the truth.
You didn't really expect to find me
in the booth, did you?
-
- Son of a bitch!
Poor dumb cop!
I'm not so infantile
as to let myself get pinpointed
by your stupid tracing machine.
And now you'll have to excuse me, Kitty’s just's just dying to get started.
You should see her.
You don't know what to do,
do you?
You're not even sure
if your little whore is with me.
Her skin is so warm...
and soft.
Remember?
You should know.
I feel sorry for you, Mr. Cop.
You'd like to make sure
Kitty's with me, wouldn't you?
Wanna hear her voice?
Well, I think you have a right to!
Move, move, move!
No! No!
Checkmate.
You think according to
fixed patterns, like a cop.
Dd
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Nice work. How's your heart?
Hmph.
You wanna take a look at it?
The doctor says I gotta give up smoking.
If I take it easy, I'll survive.
What can you tell me about him?
Well, from the pulmonary exam,
the cause of death was suffocation.
You know, the cellophane bag
he had on.
Time of death?
Well, that I have on the button:
Tuesday the 10th, eight days ago.
Eight days?
Bullshit, man.
That son of a bitch-
he murdered Kitty four days ago.
He can't be dead for eight days!
You're wrong!
Come on, Barnaby.
How long have we known each other?
Sixteen years or more, no?
If I tell you the moment of death
was eight days ago,
it means it was eight days ago.
Sure, l- I admit I could be
a couple hours off, but no more.
Jesus Christ.
What's the matter?
Oh, nothing.
Nothing.
It was not Mikis Kalenda. Okay?
So we're back to square one.
Well, we are and we're not.
Because by wiping out Kalenda,
who was really just a procurer,
it tends to bring us back to-
to my original idea...
of a person who has to blame the rest
of society for his own shortcomings.
Let's say it's a woman.
She picks her victims because
they're young, they're prettier...
and a great deal more fortunate than her.
And if it's a man?
Well, a man with a woman
whom he's in love with...
but who has something wrong
with her, like she's frigid,
can get very paranoiac.
In which case,
he used Mikis to run around
procuring his women?
It would appear so.
No, Kalenda was a petty criminal
who got caught in the middle.
Yes, he was a pervert
who tried to assault Fay Majors,
and when she fingered him
he tried to kill her.
Found himself
in a dead-end street,
and knowing he would probably
get blamed for all the other murders
he put a bag over his head.
Dr. Richardson to Ward 5.
"Now, on Granny Duck's farm,
there was a tiny pig,
"a baby pig just born,
"and when they saw it,
they all jumped up and down with glee.
"Oh, they were excited!
"'How sweet he is!
How tiny, tiny!
"I never knew piggies
could be so cute and funny!
I wish we could take him home! '
"Granny said,
'Quack, quack. You like him?
"'He's a good little piggy.
"You can have him if you want, but you'll
have to ask your uncle's permission.'
"So lickety-split they called their uncle,
who said, 'Quack, quack. Harrumph! '
"'But, Uncle, you said
you had a puppy when you were little.
Can't we have one too? '
"And their uncle went,
'Quack, quack. Okay, okay.
"But it better not be very big
or eat too much.'
"'Oh, thanks, Uncle! '
"So they picked up the piggy
and took it home.
"And when the uncle saw it,
he was mad!
"'I think that was a nasty trick.
"'You didn't tell me you were
talking about a baby pig.
"Quack, quack! Take him back! '
"'Oh, please, Uncle. He's so tiny.'
"'Well, okay, quack, quack.
Just so long as he doesn't dirty-"'
Well, I found out that Fay Majors
is enrolled at the university,
so I, uh-
I went and I fished out
her aptitude tests.
Apart from
an incredibly high I.Q.,
there's also a note
with five stars saying that
she tends toward hallucinations...
and quite often she has visions
which to her seem reality.
Now,
does that ring a bell?
I'm just a stupid cop, right?
So it may surprise you to know that I've
had her followed since first thing this morning.
Is that you, Fay?
Fay? Fay?
Hi, honey.
Where have you been?
Around.
- What do you want to eat tonight?
- Anything you want.
Okay.
No one's come around to see her
in months now.
How much time
has she got left?
Almost none.
Her entire lymphatic system is shot.
It's very sad.
A sweet, intelligent girl...
just lying there day after day
fading away.
A terrible process.
That's lymphogranuloma.
And here she lies
with one parent off in Brazil.
And the other, you say,
pays the bills and never visits.
No. Her parents had her committed,
but they only came to see her once
after the amputation.
She'll never grow up
to be a woman.
Now I understand.
Under that tent lies the motive.
Lieutenant, I'd have Peter Bunch's house
put under surveillance immediately.
You really don't have much faith
in us, do you? It already is.
Hello?
This is the little duck. How are ya?
We haven't played in such a long time.
Did you call headquarters?
Nah, they'd just make a mess.
Bye-bye.
Fay?
Fay? Fay!
Fay!
Don't go in Susie's room!
Stay out of Susie's roo-
You're like-
You're like all the rest of them!
Young and beautiful
and healthy!
While I rot to death in bed
in a lousy, stinking hospital!
Hmm?
What is it, Susie?
You want to call your father up
to play ducks again?
That hallucination
made me start to wonder.
Then the hospital bill,
those marks on the wall
by the movie house,
the broken knife.
But I was sure of it when I heard Peter
on the phone with his daughter...
and he started to speak
with a strange voice,
telling her all about how the-
how the world is unfair and-
And then he started
talking about me...
and how-
how he planned to
get rid of me!
It's all over.
You know, it's strange,
the brain.
The duck was what snapped
in Peter's mind.
It's what happens
when you want to erase guilt.
In putting all the onus on the duck,
he wasn't the one who was responsible.
The duck became a kind of
outside avenger for his daughter...
who would never become
like other women,
and he never realized that
a little affection is all she asked...
for her to bear the tragedy
of her condition.
Daddy, please don't leave me alone.
P-Please.
Please answer.
Speak to me.
Daddy, please, please answer.
Daddy!
