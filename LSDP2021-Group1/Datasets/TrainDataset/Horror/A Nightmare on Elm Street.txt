You OK, Tina?
Just a dream, Ma.
Some dream, judging from that.
You coming back
to the sack or what?
Hold your horses.
Tina, honey, you got
to cut your fingernails...
or you got to stop
that kind of dreaming.
One or the other.
One...two...
Freddy's coming for you.
Three...four...
Better lock your door.
Five...six...
Grab your crucifix.
Seven...eight...
Gonne stay up late.
Nine...ten...
Never sleep again...
It was so scary.
When I woke up...
it seemed like he was still
in the room with me.
Sounds like a real bogeyman.
"One...two...
Freddy's coming for you."
That's what it reminded me of--
that old jump rope song.
It was
the worst nightmare I ever had.
You wouldn't believe it.
As a matter of fact, I had
a bad dream last night myself.
I had a hard-on this morning
when I woke up, Tina.
Had your name
written all over it.
There's four letters
in my name, Rod.
How could there be room
on your joint for four letters?
Hey! Up yours
with a twirling lawnmower.
Rod says the sweetest things.
He's nuts about you.
Yeah, nuts. Anyway...
I couldn't go back
to sleep last night.
So, what did you dream?
Forget it, Tina.
The point is that everyone has
a bad dream once in a while.
It's no biggie.
Next time you're having one,
just tell yourself...
that's all it is
right while you're having it.
Once you do that,
you wake right up.
At least, it works for me.
Did you have a nightmare, too?
Maybe we're going
to have a big earthquake.
They say things get
really weird just before.
I'm so glad you guys
could come over tonight.
When my mom said she was taking
off for two days, I almost died.
No problem, Tina.
Nancy and Glen to the rescue.
I can't believe his mother's
letting him spend the night.
Right, well...she's not exactly.
See, I got this cousin
who lives near the airport.
It's OK for me
to stay with him.
And I got this
sound effects tape from Rod--
Hello, Mom?
Yeah. Out here at Barry's.
Yeah, noisy as usual.
Glad we don't live here, huh?
Aunt Eunice says hello.
I'll call you in the morning.
Yeah, sure--
Just some kids drag racing
outside, I think, Mom.
Listen, Mom. I got to go.
I think there's been
an accident out front.
All right, I'll call the police.
I'll call the police!
Just some neighbours having
a fight, I guess.
I'm fine.
I'll call you in the morning.
It worked like a charm.
Smooth.
Jesus.
See? I told you
you'd be feeling better.
All day long I've been seeing
that guy's weird face...
and hearing those fingernails.
Fingernails?
That's amazing you saying that.
That made me remember
the dream I had last night.
What did you dream?
I dreamed about a guy in
a dirty red and green sweater.
What about the fingernails?
He scraped his fingernails
along things.
Actually, they were more like
finger-knives...
something he made himself.
But they made a horrible sound.
It was like...
You dreamed
about the same creep I did.
That's impossible.
What?
Nothing.
There's something out there,
isn't there?
I didn't hear anything.
I heard something.
I'm going to punch out
your lights, whoever you are.
Kitty, kitty.
Chow, chow, chow?
It's Rod Lane
bringing Lantz down...
just three yards
from the goal line!
What a brilliant tackle,
and the fans go wild!
What the hell
are you doing here?
Came to make up. No big deal.
Your mom home?
Of course. What's that?
Intense, huh?
What's going on here,
an orgy or something?
Maybe a funeral, dickhead.
It's just
a sleep-over date, Rod.
Tina and me.
Glen was just leaving.
Did you see his face?
Your mom isn’t home, is she?
Me and Tina
got stuff to discuss.
We got her mother's bed.
You guys got the rest.
I think we should
get out of here.
You guys are going
to hang around, right?
Don't leave me alone
with this lunatic.
Please, Nancy?
Glen, not now.
We're here for Tina now,
not ourselves.
Why is she so bothered
by a stupid nightmare anyway?
Because he was scary,
that's why!
Morality sucks.
I knew there was something
about you I liked.
You feel better now?
Jungle man fix Jane.
No more fights?
No more fights.
No more nightmares
for either one of us, then.
When did you have a nightmare?
Guys can have nightmares, too,
you know.
You isn’t got a corner
on the market.
Who do you think you are?
Whoever you are.
Somebody there?
Who the hell is that?
Shit.
Please, God--
This...
is God.
Watch this.
Nancy! Open the door!
Rod, help me!
Help me, Rod!
Who did this? I'll kill you!
Who did this?
You scared me!
What have you got?
Her name was Tina Gray.
It was her home.
Father abandoned, 10 years ago.
Mother's in Vegas
with a boyfriend.
We're trying to reach her now.
What's the coroner got?
Something like a razor
was the weapon...
but nothing was found
at the scene.
It looks like
the victim's boyfriend.
Lieutenant, where is she?
I put her in your office.
His name's Rod Lane.
He's a musician type.
He's been arrested for drugs,
brawling.
Terrific. What the hell was she
doing there?
She lived there.
I don't mean her.
I mean you.
What was she doing there?
Hello to you, too, Donald.
Marge. OK.
How you doing, baby?
I'm OK, Dad.
Look, I don't want to get
into this now.
God knows you need time.
But I sure would like to know
what the hell you were doing...
shacking up with three kids
in the middle of the night...
especially a lunatic
delinquent like Lane.
Rod is not a lunatic, Dad.
You have a sane explanation
for what he did?
Apparently,
he was crazy jealous.
Nancy said they'd had a fight.
It wasn't that serious.
Maybe you don't think
murder is serious.
How can you say I don't
take her death seriously?
Look, all I meant...
was that their fights
weren't that serious.
You know Tina dreamed
this was going to happen.
What?
She'd had a nightmare that
someone was trying to kill her.
That's why we were there, Mom.
She just didn't want
to sleep alone.
Police say the victim,
had quarrelled earlier
with her boyfriend Rod Lane.
Lane is now the subject
of a citywide manhunt.
The murder weapon...
a straight razor or similar
sharp object, has not yet--
Where do you think you're going?
To school.
Honey, you were tossing and
turning all night last night.
You have no business
going to school today.
I've got to go to school,
Mother.
Otherwise, I'll sit up there
and go crazy.
Did you sleep?
I'll sleep in study hall.
I'd rather keep busy.
Right home after?
Right home after.
See you.
I'm not going to hurt you!
They're going
to kill me for sure.
Nobody's going to kill you.
Did you do it?
I never touched her.
You were screaming like crazy.
There was somebody else there.
The door was locked
from your side!
Don't look at me
like I'm some fucking fruitcake!
I'm warning you!
Just move away from her, son.
Real easy, like your ass
depended on it.
Hold it!
Jesus Christ!
Hold it right there!
Watch it!
I'm cool!
I got him.
On the ground! Now!
Come on! Get down!
Lieutenant, look at this!
A switchblade!
I didn't do it!
I didn't kill her, Nancy!
Daddy?
You used me.
What the hell were you doing...
going to school today for
anyway?
Let go of my arm !
What is seen
is not always what is real.
According to Shakespeare,
there was something operating...
in nature, perhaps inside human
nature itself, that was rotten.
"A canker," as he put it.
Of course,
Hamlet's response to this...
and to his mother's lies was to
continually probe and dig.
Just like the gravediggers...
always trying to get
beneath the surface.
The same is true
in a different way...
in Julius Caesar.
John, will you go ahead, please?
"In the most high
and palm state of Rome...
"A little ere
the mightiest Julius fell.
"The grave stood tenantless...
"and the sheeted dead
did squeak and gibber...
"in the Roman streets.
"As stars with trains
of fire and dues of blood...
"disaster's in the sun
and the moist air...
"upon whose influence
Neptune's empire stands..."
"Oh, God, I could be
bounded in a nutshell...
"and count myself
a king of infinite space...
"were it not
that I have bad dreams."
Where's your pass?
Screw your pass.
Hey, Nancy!
No running in the hallway.
Who are you?
Gonne get you.
It's only a dream !
Come to Freddy.
God damn you!
OK! OK! Thompson!
I'll call your mother.
Everything is all right now.
Come on. Sit down.
I'm OK.
I'm fine.
You sure?
I'll go straight home.
You'll need a hall pass.
Back to work.
And then what happened?
I told you.
It was dark, but I'm sure
there was somebody in there...
under the covers with her.
How could somebody be under
the covers with you guys...
without you knowing about it?
How the fuck do I know?
I don't expect you
to believe me anyway.
What did he look like?
Did you get a look at him?
Then how do you know
that somebody else was there?
Because somebody cut her
while I watched.
And you didn't get a look
at him?
I couldn't even see the fucker.
You could just see...
cuts happening...
all at once.
What do you mean all at once?
It was as if
there were four razors...
cutting her at the same time...
but invisible ones.
You know, I probably
could have saved her...
if I'd have moved sooner.
But I thought it was
just another nightmare...
Like the one I had
the night before.
There was this guy.
He had knives for fingers.
You think I did it?
One...two...
Freddy's coming for you.
Three...four...
Better lock your door.
Five...six...
Grab your crucifix.
Seven...eight...
Gonne stay up late.
Nine...ten...
Never sleep...again.
What, Mother?
Don't fall asleep in there.
You could drown, you know.
Oh, for Pete's sakes.
It happens all the time.
I've heated up
some warm milk for you, honey.
Warm milk?
Gross.
Help!
Hold on, baby!
Mom !
I'm OK.
-You're OK?
-I'm OK.
But I heard you screaming.
You were calling me.
I just slipped getting out
of the tub, Mom.
But I told you...
hundreds of people a year
get killed like that, honey.
I know, but I'm OK, Mother.
I'm sorry for scaring you.
I'll turn down your bed.
I'll get my pyjamas on.
...the act of
bodily dismemberment.
I'm sorry.
I saw your light was on.
I thought I'd see how you were.
Sometimes I wish you didn't live
right across the street.
Will you shut up and let me in?
Did you ever stand on a trellis
in your bare feet?
Get inside before
somebody sees you.
I hit my head.
Got to be quiet.
Mom's not even asleep yet.
If you don't mind.
So, I heard you freaked out
in English class today.
Yeah, I guess I did.
You haven't slept yet, have you?
Not really.
What did you do to your arm?
I burned it in English class.
Oh, God. I look 20 years old.
Did you have
any weird dreams last night?
Slept like a rock.
Do you believe that people...
can dream about
what's going to happen?
No.
Do you believe in the bogeyman?
No.
Rod killed Tina,
and you know that.
I've got a crazy favour
to ask you.
It's nothing hard or anything.
I'm going to go and look
for somebody...
and I want you to stand...
Like a sort of a guard, OK?
Now, you can't mess up.
A lot might depend on this.
I won't screw up.
Turn off the light.
Here's what we're going to do.
It's dark in here.
And it's not
what you're thinking.
Are you still watching?
Yeah. So?
I'm just checking.
Watch out!
Watch out!
Wake up!
Are you there?
I'm here.
Nancy, help me, please.
Save me from--
Freddy!
This is just a dream.
This isn't real.
This is just a dream.
He isn't real.
Glen, you bastard.
What did I do?
I just
asked you to do one thing...
just stay awake and watch me...
just wake me up if it looked
like I was having a bad dream...
and what did you do?
You shit.
You fell asleep.
Oh, shit.
Hurry.
Shut up and stay there.
Don't go away.
Are you OK?
Yeah. It was just
a little dream, that's all.
I'm going right back to sleep.
Call me if you need anything.
You mind telling me
what's going on?
Just come on.
Garcia, I've got to see
Rod Lane again.
You know,
I took the night shift...
so I could get
some peace and quiet.
It's urgent!
We have reason to believe
that there might be...
something very strange
going on here.
Got no argument with that.
What are you doing here?
There's an unsolved murder...
and I don't like
unsolved murders...
especially ones that
my daughter's mixed up in.
What are you doing here?
At this hour,
you should be home in bed.
I just want to see if he's OK.
Nancy, take my word for it.
The guy's sleeping like a baby.
He's not going anywhere.
Just go down and look at him.
Please, Daddy.
All right.
Garcia, give me the keys.
Right.
Where the hell
did I put the keys?
Help! Help!
Jesus!
Cut him down.
Grab his legs.
I got him.
Grab his back, would you?
Lower him.
Ashes to ashes...
Dust to dust.
May God be
with this young man's soul.
His life and his death...
attest to
the scriptures' warning...
that he who lives by the sword
shall die by the sword.
But let us recall also
our Lord's admonition...
that we judge not,
lest we be judged.
And may Rod Lane rest in peace.
Time to go, honey.
Hop in.
The killer's still loose,
you know?
You're saying somebody else
killed Tina?
Who?
I don't know who he is...
but he's burned,
and he wears a weird hat...
and a red and green sweater,
really dirty...
and he uses these knives,
like giant fingernails.
You better keep her home
for a few days...
until she really gets
over the shock of this.
I've got something better.
I'm going to get her some help.
I don't see why you couldn't
just give me a pill...
to keep me from dreaming.
Everyone's got to dream,
young lady.
If you don't dream, you go.
All set.
Please, Nancy, trust us.
It's not you I don't trust.
It's just...
Let's do it.
Thank you, nurse.
How long has this been going on?
Since the murders.
She was fine before that.
Now she thinks
her dreams are real.
There's no sign
of pathology in her EEG.
I'd guess that what we have
is just a normal girl...
who happens to have gone
through two days of hell.
She's asleep now.
Thank God.
What the hell are dreams anyway?
Mysteries.
Incredible body hocus-pocus.
The truth is we still
don't know what they are...
or where they come from.
She's going into deep sleep now.
Heart rate is a little high.
It's just due to anxiety.
Otherwise, she's nicely relaxed.
All signs are normal.
She could dream at any time now.
Beta waves are slowing.
She's into REMs now.
She's definitely dreaming now.
It's a good one, too.
Typical dream parameter.
A nightmare now would be
plus or minus five or six.
She's about three.
Doctor, what's she doing now?
Is she asleep or awake?
Something's wrong.
It never gets this high.
What's she doing?
I don't know.
Is she dreaming?
Nancy, it's Mom !
What?
Her hair.
Excuse me.
This'll help you sleep.
Oh, my God, her arm !
Get something.
What happened, baby?
What happened?
It's OK.
I brought something out
from my dream.
Where did you get that?
I grabbed it off his head.
She said she grabbed it off
his head in her dream.
No, I'm not crazy.
I'm holding the damn thing
right here in my hand.
I don't know where
she really found it.
I got to go.
You didn't sleep at all
last night, did you?
You know the doctor says
you have to sleep, or--
I'll go even crazier?
I don't think you're crazy.
And stop drinking
that damn coffee.
So, did you ask Daddy
to have the hat examined?
I threw that filthy thing away.
I don't know
where you really found it...
or what you're trying to prove.
What I learned
in the dream clinic...
that's what I'm trying
to prove, Mother.
Rod didn't kill Tina,
and he didn't hang himself.
It's this guy.
He's after us in our dreams.
That's just not reality, Nancy.
It's real, Mama.
Feel it.
Give me that damn thing.
It even has his name
written in it.
Fred Krueger, Mom.
Do you know who that is, Mother?
Because if you do,
you better tell me...
because he's after me now.
Nancy, trust your mother
for once, please.
You'll feel better
when you get some sleep.
Feel better?
You call this feeling better?
Or maybe I should grab that
bottle and veg out with you.
Avoid everything happening to me
by just getting good and loaded.
Fred Krueger
can't come after you, Nancy.
He's dead.
Believe me.
I know.
You knew about him
all this time...
and you've been acting like
it was something I made up?
Nancy, you're sick.
There's something wrong
with you.
You're imagining things.
You'll feel better
when you sleep.
It's just as simple as that.
Screw sleep!
It's just a nightmare.
That's enough.
Whenever I get nervous, I eat.
And if you can't do that,
you sleep.
I used to.
Not anymore.
Did you ever read about
the Balinese way of dreaming?
They got this whole system
they call dream skills.
So if you have a nightmare,
for instance, like falling.
Right.
Well, instead of screaming
and getting all nuts...
you say, "I'm going
to make up my mind...
"that I fall
into a magic world."
Make it something special
like a poem or a song.
They get all their art
and literature from dreams.
Just wake up and write it down.
Dream skills.
What if they meet a monster
in their dreams?
They turn their back on it.
Take away its energy,
and it disappears.
But what happens
if they don't do that?
Then I guess those people don't
wake up to tell what happens.
Great.
"Booby Traps & Improvised
Anti-Personnel Devices"?
What are you reading that for?
I'm into survival.
See ya.
You're starting to scare me.
Oh, gross.
Mother!
What's with the bars?
Security.
Security from what?
Not from what, from whom.
Come down to the cellar with me,
and I'll tell you.
You want to know
who Fred Krueger was?
He was
a filthy child murderer...
who killed at least 20 kids
in the neighbourhood.
Kids we all knew.
Oh, Mom.
It drove us crazy when we
didn't know who it was...
but it was even worse
after they caught him.
Did they put him away?
The lawyers got fat
and the judge got famous...
but somebody forgot
to sign the search warrant...
in the right place...
and Krueger was free
just like that.
What did you do, Mother?
A bunch of us parents
tracked him down...
after they let him out.
We found him in
an old abandoned boiler room...
where he used to take his kids.
Go on.
We took gasoline...
We poured it
all around the place...
and made a trail of it
out the door...
then lit the whole thing up
and watched it burn.
But he can't get you now.
He's dead, honey,
because Mommy killed him.
I even took his knives.
So it's OK now.
You can sleep.
Oh, hi, how you doing?
Fine.
Stand by your window
so I can see you.
You sound a million miles away.
That's much better.
I see your mom went ape
at the security store today.
You look like the Prisoner
of Zenda or something.
How long's it been
since you slept?
It's coming up
on the seventh day.
It's OK. I checked Guinness.
The record's 11.
Listen, Glen, I know who he is.
Who?
The killer.
-You do?
-Yes.
And if he gets me,
I'm pretty sure you're next.
Why would anybody
want to kill me?
Don't ask.
Just give me some help
nailing the guy...
when I bring him out.
Bring him out of what?
My dream.
How do you plan to do that?
Just like I did the hat.
Have a hold of the sucker
when you wake me up.
Wait a minute.
You can't bring somebody
out of a dream.
If I can't,
then you can all relax...
because it's just a case
of me being nuts.
I can save you the trouble.
You're nutty as a fruitcake.
I love you anyway.
Good.
Then you won't mind
cold-cocking this guy...
when I bring him out.
What?
You heard me.
I grab the guy in my dream.
You see me struggling,
so you wake me up.
We both come out, you whack
the fucker, and we got him.
Are you crazy?
Hit him with what?
You're the jock.
You have a baseball bat
or something.
Just meet me at my porch
at midnight.
Oh, and meanwhile...
Meanwhile?
Whatever you do,
don't fall asleep.
Midnight?
Oh, man.
Midnight.
Baseball bats and bogeymen.
Beautiful.
Honey?
How can you listen
to television...
and hear your records
at the same time?
Oh, I wasn't listening
to the tube, Ma.
Just watching.
Miss Nude America
is going to be on tonight.
How can you hear
what she's going to say?
Who cares what she says?
Don't be such a smart guy.
I want you to go to bed.
It's almost midnight.
Goodness knows we've all
had a lot to deal with...
these last few days.
I will, Mom.
You guys turning in?
Pretty soon.
Now get to bed.
It's over now, baby.
The nightmare's over.
Please.
You shouldn't stare.
You know what I think?
I think that kid
is some kind of lunatic.
You shouldn't talk that way
about that poor child.
You mean those bars?
Marge is just being cautious
with her being all alone...
and Nancy
acting so nervous lately.
I don't care what you say.
I don't want that kid hanging
around with our son anymore.
Glen, answer the phone.
Just a minute.
It's her.
She wants to talk to Glen.
About what?
What's this about, Nancy?
Just a minute.
She says it's private.
Very private and very important.
Give me that.
Glen's asleep. You'll have
to talk to him tomorrow.
You've just got to be firm
with these kids.
Let's go.
As a matter of fact...
Damn.
Don't fall asleep.
Oh, brilliant.
What if Glen tries to call?
I'm your boyfriend now, Nancy.
My boyfriend.
Mom !
Locked, locked, locked, locked.
I locked it all up.
I had to.
Nancy, you are going
to get some sleep tonight...
if it kills me.
Give me the key, Mother.
I can't. I don't
even have it on me. See?
Damn it!
It is now 12 midnight...
and this is station KRGR
leaving the air.
Help, Mom !
Come on, Frank.
I'll give you a hand.
You won't need
a stretcher up there.
You'll need a mop.
Don't tell me it's another one.
Lieutenant Thompson,
I'm sorry to wake you...
but I've never seen anything
like this before in my life.
And I knew
this is your neighbourhood...
so I thought I'd better
call you right away.
The coroner's upstairs now,
but I don't think that he's...
Oh, my God.
I'll get him right away.
Lieutenant, it's your daughter.
Hi, Daddy.
I know what happened.
I haven't been upstairs yet.
But you know he's dead, right?
Yeah. Apparently he's dead.
Listen, Daddy,
I've got a proposition for you.
Listen very carefully, please.
I'm going to go and get
the guy who did it...
and I want you to be there
to arrest him...
when I bring him out, OK?
Just tell me who did it.
I'll go get him, baby.
Fred Krueger did it, Daddy...
and only I can get him.
It's my nightmare he comes to.
Just come here
and break the door down...
in exactly 20 minutes.
Can you do that?
Yeah, sure.
That'll be exactly
half past midnight.
Time enough for me
to fall asleep and find him.
Honey, you just do that.
Get yourself some sleep.
That's what I've been
telling you all along.
But you'll be here to catch him?
Lieutenant, they're waiting
for you upstairs.
Sure, I'll be there, sweetheart.
You just get yourself
some rest...please?
Deal?
I love you, sweetheart.
Go outside
and watch my daughter's house.
If you see anything funny,
call me.
Anything funny, like what?
I don't know.
One thing for sure, I don't
want her coming over here.
She's too far gone
to be able to handle this.
What the hell did that,
Lieutenant?
I don't know.
What has the coroner got to say?
He's in the john puking
since he saw it.
I guess I should have
told you about him then.
Just get some sleep, Mom.
It's going to be OK.
I was just trying
to protect you.
I didn't see how much
you needed to know.
You face things.
That's your nature.
That's your gift...
but sometime you have to
turn away, too.
I love you.
I love you, too, baby.
Night.
OK, Krueger.
We play on your court.
And now I lay me down to sleep.
I pray
the Lord my soul to keep...
and if I die before I wake...
I pray the Lord my soul to take.
Countdown mode.
Ten minutes and counting.
What if they meet a monster
in their dreams?
They turn their back on it.
Take away its energy,
and it disappears.
What happens if they
don't do that?
Then I guess those people don't
wake up to tell what happens.
You dreamed about
the same creep I did.
Gonne get you.
I'm here!
Come out and show yourself,
you bastard!
Shit.
Come on, Krueger!
Follow me!
Damn it!
Where are you?
Where are you, Krueger?
I know you're here.
Final 10 seconds.
Nine, eight, seven, six...
Bitch.
I got you now!
I'm crazy after all.
Come on, Krueger!
Take it down!
Come and get me!
Help!
I've got him ! Hey, Daddy!
I've got him trapped!
Help! Where are you?
Everything's going to be all right!
Everything's under control!
Get my dad, you asshole!
Come on!
He's in here!
Don't let him kill me, too!
Come on, Freddy.
Can't you catch me?
I'm going to split you in two.
Daddy, help me, please!
Maybe I better go
tell the Lieutenant.
I'll kill you slow.
Where are you?
Daddy, I did it!
Please hurry!
Where are you?
Parker, I need some help here!
OK, you guys.
Come on, let's go.
Let's go.
Al, Tim, get over here.
Get you out.
Open this door!
Watch yourself. I got it.
It's Krueger!
Get out of the way.
This way, guys. Come down here.
Oh, my God.
Nancy, what the hell
is going on?
Parker, get up here!
We got a fire up here, too.
We're on our way up.
What the hell is going on,
Nancy?
He's after Mother!
Watch out! He's under there!
Now do you believe me?
They've got the fires out
downstairs.
Everything OK up here?
I'm OK.
You go downstairs.
I'll be there in a minute.
Lieutenant,
is everything all right?
I don't know.
I know you're there, Freddy.
You think you was
going to get away from me?
I know you too well now,
Freddy.
Now you die.
It's too late, Krueger.
I know the secret now.
This is just a dream.
You're not alive.
This whole thing
is just a dream.
I want
my mother and friends again.
You what?
I take back
every bit of energy I gave you.
You're nothing.
You're shit.
It's bright.
It's going to burn off soon,
or it wouldn't be so bright.
Feeling better?
Oh, I feel like a million bucks.
They say you've bottomed out...
when you can't remember
the night before.
You know, baby,
I'm going to stop drinking.
I just don't feel like it
anymore.
Did I keep you awake last night?
You look a little bit peaked.
I guess I just slept heavy.
I'll see you.
See you.
Hi, everybody.
You believe this fog?
I believe anything is possible.
Looking good, girl.
What happened?
What's going on?
Hey, I'm not doing this.
Let us out!
I'm not doing this.
What's going on with the window?
No! Mother!
What's going on?
One, two...
Freddy's coming for you.
Three, four...
Better lock your door.
Five, six...
Grab your crucifix.
Seven, eight...
Gonne stay up late.
Nine, ten...
Never sleep again.
