It's last break before the climbing!
Have you forgotten anything?
It's too late now anyways.
Are you missing anything?
What?
Nothing.
Are you bothered by Guillaume?
Forget it
You could've told me
Why don't you take
this time to get to know him?
Got everytrhing?
Yeah.
I'm sorry
I had no choice
Don't worry about it
Sure?
It's been four years
since I've seen him.
This trip will change your mind.
It's gonna be fine, I promise.
Attention! Thanks.
We'll be arriving in 20 minutes
You'll see it's really peaceful
Along the Resnjak
There are several sections
the Stairway to Heaven
Purgatory
the Angels' Traverse
the Devil's Gateway.
And after that we arrive at
A ladder leading to a zip-line
Ok
You can ride it in 4 hours.
Then stop for drinks.
Photo?
NO!
You have no choice
NO!
Photo!
Come on, guys.
Photo!
Fred! Excuse me, thanks.
I'd like to be in the center
Vertigo
Croatia, August 18
Oh no, Open the window
Open it
Give me some
Where did you get that?
At the Zagreb Station
while waiting for you
Croatia is so beautiful
Glad to see me?
I can't get the signal
We're leaving civilization
Guest what I've found?
We sang that in high school
Ok
Sing along
This is our song
Without hands
It'll be awesome
It's easy?
Anyone can do it
Don't worry
You're attached to
the lifeline
It reminds me of the Alps
Me, that I'm hungry
Didn't you eat lunch?
Wait up, Fred
Come on. Hurry up.
Isn't it beautiful?
Yeah, it's impressive
Chloe
Chloe, wait
What's with you?
Nothing. I'm happy to see you.
Can't I just tell you that or...
Your boyfriend look jealous
I'll go back to France
So?
What are you doing?
The path is closed
NO
Is there a problem
Apparently
We're screwed
Wait, maybe not
Fred we're not doing it
It's closed
There's not even a ladder
Who cares
Fred.
Come back.
I'll just check something
Fred, dammit!
It looked dangerous
It does, kids
There's a way up
I'll mark out the route
The path is there
Grab the rope
Got it
Fred says there's a way up
It really looks fantastic
If you don't want to go
we'll go back
For me it's ok
It's exciting, isn't it?
It looks completely stupid
At worst, we'll bring you back down
Chloe
It's up to you
Well, here we go
Ok, Let's go
Come on
Shall I stay?
Get up there
Your turn
Go, go
Go ahead.
You'll see
It's good for you but
That's it!
Mademoiselle.
Well done Loic, Continue
You're almost there.
Super.
Use your right hand
Karine told me
She told you what?
About the boy in the hospital
and everything
I know you've done everything you could
You don't know anything
You weren't there
Hold it tight with your right hand
Go up
Slowly
Use your feet. That's it.
Good
Mademoiselle...
Fuck off!
You're doing okey?
Yeah yeah, fine, thanks
What about you?
Yeah?
uh-huh
Ok I'll lead
Karine, stay with Loic
Chloe behind them
Guillaume, you're at the end?
It's important you're always
attached to the lifeline.
And never more than two people
on the same section.
All Okey?
Then, let's go!
In New Zealand,
it's pretty much the same
When are you leaving?
Next year.
After Australia
Canada
and St. Barth
My ass in the Caribbean
And you?
It depends on my posting
Didn't you want to quit?
I don't know yet
We're almost at the bridge
Are you alright?
Yeah
You're pale
Loic pass me your bag
It gets a bit harder now
Don't worry about me
Damn
I've often heard about you
Ok
Here we are
If you want to turn around
it's now or never
Are you okey?
Yes, I'll come
Loic, if you've got vertigo
we'll meet you back at the car.
Well I'm going
Awesome
It's great!
You'll enjoy it
You'll see
it's a blast
Ok
One foot in front of the other
Don't look down
That's good, continue
Great
It's incredible
Isn't it awesome?
It's better than I thought!
Loic?
Loic, come to me
No!
Karine wait a minute.
Come to me
There, come
That's good
There
Keep going
Over there?
Yes?
Come on, damnit!
Go! Go!
You're almost there
That's it.
Don't touch me
I can manage on my own

It's OK! It's OK!
I've got you! I've got you!
Now, what will we do?
I don't know
We keep going
We have no choice
We must finish the trail before nightfall
I don't understand
can't we just go down
No, not like this
It would be climbing
And we're not equipped for that
Was that the only way out?
Yes
We're screwed because of you.
Get us out of this shithole!
And what's your idea?
Nobody asked you to come!
It's Ok
It's Ok
It's gonna be alright, no need
to yell at eachother.
Ok! Let's move
Shit!
What's wrong?
The lifeline snapped
What's wrong?
It's alright Loic
It gets easier
Shit
Loic are you okey?
Calm down
Breathe. Calm down. All is ok.
Damn
How does it look like up there?
Looks like we can make it
I'll come with you
Ok
Ok, Loic
Loic listen to me, you twat

We'll pull you up. Don't move.
Ok

Loic okey?
Are you okey?
We'll go up and then use the tyrolean
Ok
You're tired. Try to relax
And above all, don't move.
Slow down, there's no pitons
If you fall...
I won't
Hurry
We must go around the cliff
Let's tie the rope
Loic, Loic?
Remember what Fred said?
I don't care.
