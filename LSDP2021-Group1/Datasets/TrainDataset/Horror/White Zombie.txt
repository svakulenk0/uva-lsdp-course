Looks like a burial.
In the road?
Driver, what is it?
It’s a funeral, Mademoiselle.
They are afraid of the men
who steal dead bodies.
So they dig the grave in
the middle of the road
where people pass all the time.
Well, that’s a cheerful introduction
for you to our West Indies.
Do you know where is the house
of monsieur Beaumont?
Zombies!  Aller vite! Allez!
It felt like hands touching me.
Driver, why did you drive
like that you fool?
We might have been killed!
Worse than that, Monsieur,
we might have been caught.
Caught? By whom?
Those men you spoke to?
They are not men Monsieur
they are dead bodies.
Dead?
Yes, Monsieur
Zombies.
The living dead.
Corpses taken from their graves
who are made to work in sugar mills
and fields at night.
Look!
Here they come!
Look, look!
Excuse me please,
have you got a match?
Did I frighten you?
I’m sorry.
I’m oddly enough I suppose.
No, it wasn’t you.
Something happened back
on the road there.
We stopped to speak to some men.
Our driver told us that they
weren’t men at all.
He said they were corpses.
Corpses.
Surely you don’t believe it do you?
No. But I don’t know
Haiti is full of nonsense
and superstition.
They’re always mixed up
with a lot of mysteries
that will turn your hair grey
I’ve been a missionary here for,
oh, thirty years,
and at times I don’t know what to think.
Come, let’s go in the house.
Oh, yes, come dear.
Is Mr. Beaumont in?
You are expected, Dr. Bruner.
Yes, I’ve been sent for to marry someone.
Maybe
How long is it that you’ve
known Mr. Beaumont?
Oh, only a few days.
Madeline introduced him on
the docks in Port-au-Prince.
Ah, and you?
I met him on the ship coming from New York.
He was very kind during the voyage.
Madeline and I planned to be
married the moment she arrived,
but Mr. Beaumont persuaded
us to come here.
And he promised to take me out
of the bank at Port-au-Prince
and send me to New York as his agent.
Hmm—strange.
Very strange.
You
I’ll tell Mr. Beaumont you are here.
Yeah
It’s all right, isn’t it doctor?
Oh, I guess so.
You see I
I've only met Mr. Beaumont once or twice.
but
But he never struck me like the
man who would take the trouble
to play fairy godfather
to a young couple like you.
Unless—
Unless what, sir?
I suppose you’ll think I’m a
meddling old fool, but,
you know, I’d feel a good deal better
if you’d clear out of this place
after you’re married,
and have nothing more
to do with Mr. Beaumont.
The young people have arrived sir,
and Dr. Bruner.
They are waiting in the reception hall.
Show them to their rooms,
and tell them I’m out.
No, wait.
Perhaps I’d better see them.
It might look odd if I didn’t
Very odd, sir.
Especially as Dr. Bruner
is a trife skeptical as
to your—motives, sir.
Nevermind my motives.
Has that other person sent word yet?
No, sir. Not yet.
He’s twenty-four hours late.
I wish you’d keep away from
that man, sir
He'll make trouble for you.
You wouldn't worry about that
I'm not afraid of him.
I not easily frightened, sir.
You should know that.
But what you are planning is dangerous.
Don’t you suppose I know that, Silver?
You don’t seem to realize
what this girl means to me.
Why, I’d sacrifice anything I
have in the world for her.
Nothing matters if I can’t have her.
I think, ah, I think you’ll like Haiti.
Most people that—
Oh.
Madeline! I’m delighted to see you.
Neil, you’re more than welcome.
Thank you, sir.
Doctor, it is very kind of you to come
I know what a busy man you are.
No, ah, not at all.
There is a native family live out here
that I’ve been trying to
see for a long time.
After this young couple
are safely married,
I'll leave.
But surely you will stay for
dinner after the ceremony.
No no no. No, I must run along.
That’s a great pity.
We have something very special
prepared for this occasion.
It was very good of you, Madeline,
to humour the whim of a lonely man.
There was so little time to prepare,
I couldn’t do half the things
I wanted for you.
You’ve done more than enough
already Mr. Beaumont,
for a comparative.
Giving Neil a position in The States.
Neil?
Yes. Yes indeed.
Oh, yes of course.
I’m sure Neil will make
a very good agent.
But you must be tired
after your drive.
You get some rest.
Silver!
Silver will show you to your rooms.
This way please.
Delighted to see you again,
monsieur Beaumont.
Please sit.
Please.
I’m sorry to have kept you waiting, Monsieur.
I’ve been on a journey
seeking men for my mills.
Men?
They work faithfully,
and they are not worried
about long hours.
You,
you could make good use
of men like mine
on your plantations.
No.
That’s not what I want.
Then perhaps we should talk
about the young lady who
came to your house this evening.
You’ve seen her?
When?
The road, tonight.
There...
was a young man with her.
They are to be married tonight.
You waited too long to do anything.
What do you want me to do?
If she were to disappear,
for a month—
What do you hope to gain
by her disappearance?
Everything.
Everything?
do you think she will forget
her lover in a month?
Just give me a month.
One little month.
Not in a month.
Not even a year.
I looked into her eyes.
She is deep in love.
But not with you.
They are to be married within an hour.
There must be a way.
There is
a way.
The cost.
The cost is heavy.
You give me what I want,
and you may ask anything.
No!
Not that!
Only a pin point,
monsieur Beaumont,
in a glass of wine
or perhaps a flower.
Take it.
The time is very brief.
You must do your share if
I am to help you.
Keep it, Monsieur.
Keep it.
You may change your mind.
Send me word
when you use it.
I’ll find another way.
There is no other way.
They are driving away evil spirits.
Close it, close it!
Mademoiselle!
I love you, Madeline,
more than anything else
in this whole world.
Heaven or hell lies in this
little moment for me.
You could raise me up to paradise
or you could blast my world into nothing.
Its time...even...
I can make you the envy of every woman.
I’d give my life to make you happy.
Oh, listen to me dear
before it’s too late.
Don’t, please.
Don’t go into that room.
We can be in Port-au-Prince
in half an hour.
There’s a boat sailing at midnight.
You’ve been so wonderful.
Don’t spoil everything now.
One last gift before I lose you forever.
We are gathered together
here in the sight of God
and in the face of this company,
to join together
this man, this woman
in holy matrimony.
Faith.
This is the night of nights.
A toast to the bride.
To beauty’s queen.
Gladly, My Lord.
Leave but a kiss
within the glass.
Fair gypsy,
read my fortune.
What do you see in the glass?
I see...
Happiness.
I see...
Love.
far more than you can bear.
Is that all?
Não.
I see...
I see...
What is it?
I see...
Death.
Madeline!
Madeline what’s wrong?
Madeline my dear, please.
No, no!
Madeline. Madeline.
Can’t we do something?
Jesus, Jesus.
Madeline!
Not my wife.
My wife!
Praise of our lord
and saviour
and the love of God
and the fellowship of his angels.
Be with us ever more.
Amen.
Neil.
Neil.
Neil.
Neil.
Neil.
Neil!
Look!
Zombies!
Yes.
They are my servants.
Did you think we could do it alone?
In their lifetime they were my enemies.
Ledot, the witch doctor.
Once my master.
Secrets I tortured out of him.
Von Gelder, the swine.
Swollen with riches.
He fought against my
spells until the last.
In him I have a struggling type.
His Excellence, Richard.
Once minister of the interior.
Scarpia, Brigand Chief.
Marcquis, Captain of Gendarmerie.
and this
this is Chauvin.
The high executioner
who almost executed me!
I took them.
just as we will take
this one.
But what if they regain their souls?
They would tear me to pieces.
But that, my friend,
shall never be.
Madeline.
Madeline!
Madeline!
Madeline!
There’s two explanations that strike me,
either the body was stolen
by the members of a death cult
that use human bones
in their ceremonies,
or else—
Or else what?
She’s not dead.
Not dead?
Are you mad?
I saw her die,
the doctor signed the certificate.
I saw them bury her.
Now, wait
wait a minute.
I’m not mad.
But I’ve lived in these islands
for a good many years,
and I’ve seen things
with my eyes
that made me think I was crazy.
There are superstitions in Haiti
that the natives brought
here from Africa.
Some of them
can be traced back as far as
ancient Egypt,
and beyond that yet,
in the countries that was old
when Egypt was young.
Yes, but
what has that to do with Madeline?
I kissed her as she
lay there in the coffin.
And her lips were cold.
Let me explain.
Now, just a minute,
I’ll explain.
Wherever there is a superstition,
you will find there is also a practice.
Now, do you remember
what your driver told you
the night that he took you
to Beaumont’s house?
Oh, about those horrible creatures we saw.
Yeah.
He said they were corpses!
Taken from their graves.
That's is not real, no.
that’s the superstition!
Now for the practice.
The ghouls
that steal the dead corpses
from their graves,
are supposed to put them
there in the first place.
Do you mean that Madeline was murdered
so that somebody could
steal her dead body?
Aagh! Nonsense.
No, no.
not her dead
not her
Her body, yes;
but not her dead body.
That’s what I meant.
Well surely you don’t think she’s alive,
in the hands of natives!
Oh no, better dead than that.
Excuse me please,
have you got a match?
Thank you.
You don’t believe that do you?
Say,
there’s been lots of people
that’s been pronounced dead
that came alive again and
lived for years.
Now, if
nature can play pranks like that,
why isn’t it possible to
play pranks with nature?
Oh, I don’t know.
Your driver
believed he saw dead men,
walking.
He didn’t.
What he saw were men
alive in everything
but this
and this.
Oh, the whole thing has me
confused.
I just can’t understand it.
um..um
I don’t blame you.
I don't blame you.
I’ve been trying for years
to get to the bottom of these things.
To separate what you call
fact from fiction.
The law.
The law of Haiti acknowledges
the possibility of being buried alive.
Here it is in the penal code.
I’ll read it for you.
Its in French
do you speak French?
No.
Excuse me please,
have you got a match?
Right here, here’s one.
Oh, thank you. I didn’t see it there.
I’ll translate it for you.
If you could spare me.
"Article"
Article 2:49.
The use...
"The use of drugs or other practices
which produce lethargic coma,
or lifeless sleep,
shall be considered
attempted murder."
Yes.
attempeted.
Yes I see.
Yeah, alright now, wait
"If the person has been buried alive,
the act should be considered murder
no matter what result follows."
Beaumont!
Say, you said you couldn’t understand
why he was so interested in us.
Do you think he did this?
No.
No, I think his natives would.
Natives would be right.
Of course if you want to, we
could go to Beaumont’s house first.
If I could get my hands
on the devil that’s responsible for this,
I’ll make him such an example
that every witch doctor in Haiti
would be shaking in his sandals.
But we can’t do this alone.
Can’t the authorities help?
The authorities, Neil, my boy,
you don’t know these islands.
The native authorities are
afraid to meddle.
I am not.
I’ve got friends among
the natives.
They’ll tell me things that no jandam
could ever get out of you.
Because
I am a preacher
they think I am a magician.
Before we get through
with this thing,
we may uncover sins
that even the devil
would be ashamed of.
Oh,
these witch doctors
Madeline.
Foolish things,
they can’t bring back
the light to those eyes.
I was mad to do this
but if you had smiled on me,
I’d have done anything for you.
Given you anything.
I thought that beauty alone
would satisfy
but the soul is gone.
I can’t bear those
empty staring eyes.
Oh, forgive me Madeline.
Forgive me!
I can’t bear it any longer.
I must take you back!
Back to the grave,
Monsieur?
No,
you must put the life
back into her eyes
and bring laughter to her lips.
She must be gay and happy again.
You paint a charming picture, Monsieur.
One that I should like to see
myself.
You must bring her back.
Aren’t you a trife afraid,
Monsieur?
How do you suppose those eyes
will regard you
when the brain is able to understand?
Better to see hatred in them
than that dreadful emptiness.
Perhaps you’re right.
It would be a pity to
destroy such a lovely flower.
Let’s drink to the future
of this flower.
A glass of wine!
Silver,
bring wine.
We have a toast to drink.
To the future,
Monsieur.
Only
a pin point, Monsieur.
In a flower
or perhaps
a glass of wine.
You...
What are you trying to do to me?
I have other plans for Mademoiselle.
I am afraid
you might not agree.
I have taken a fancy to you,
Monsieur.
Silver!
Silver!
Don’t,
don't.
To the future,
Monsieur.
The vulture,
you
No.
Not that.
Not that!
We ought to be picking up an old witch doctor
around here pretty soon.
His name is Pierre,
I’ve known him for years.
Bright old fellow.
I don’t know just where we’ll find him.
Come son.
There are
evil
spirits in the road.
I will give you
an awonga.
And here,
this one for the ox.
Young man
is sick with distress.
Well hey,
wait a minute,
we can’t afford to have you sick.
Neil, why don’t you go over there,
we've got a hard day before us tomorrow.
Now, now then Pierre, come on.
He's gone.
We can talk.
It is a dangerous thing
you ask me to do.
Well now listen here
you know, we're old friends,
you and me, and I want to go on.
Turn back
before it is too late.
Oh, no.
I’ve come too far to turn back now.
I’m too old to go
all the way with you.
Well listen,
can’t
can’t you get somebody to go with us?
My people
all afraid of the mountain.
Why?
Because
it is called
the land
of the living dead.
Well, have,
have you ever been there?
I am the only man
that has ever come
back from there
alive.
There is an evil spirit man
that is called
"Murder".
Come,
I will tell you
all about what he did.
Vulture.
Just as old Pierre said.
A cloud of vultures
always hovers over the house
of the living dead.
Madeline.
Is she there?
No.
Oh, I must go and see her.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Neil my boy,
please, please
lie down and rest.
Please.
You’ll feel stronger in the morning.
You rest.
Let me go up and
see what I can do.
Why is she so restless tonight?
Perhaps she remembers something.
They never remember anything
when they are like that.
No?
Because
she's cut off.
Madeline.
Madeline!
No, no
I can’t, I can’t.
You must,
it's your turn.
Let’s run away.
Shh!
He might hear you.
No way.
I can’t stand it.
I am going to run away.
He will find you
and make you like her.
Can you still hear me?
It is unfortunate you are no longer
able to speak.
I should be interested to hear
you describe your symptoms.
You see, you
are the first man to know
what is happening.
None
of the others
did.
You refused
to shake hands
once.
I remember.
Well, well.
We understand each other
better now.
Madeline!
Madeline!
Madeline,
Madeline.
I found you.
You're alive.
Alive!
What’s the matter?
It's I, Neil.
Oh my darling,
what have they done to you?
Who are you?
And what are they?
To you my friend,
they are dangers of death.
Come!
Zombies!
Duck!
Look!
Madeline,
don’t you know me dear?
It’s Neil.
I could swear,
for a moment she recognized you.
Come on, don’t let him get away.
Madeline my darling!
Neil, I
I dreamed.
Excuse me please,
have you got a match?
