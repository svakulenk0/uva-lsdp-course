answering your calls.
Sharing your problems, llstenlng...
... my chlldren,
my motivation to go to work.
Just to get up In the mornlng.
I don't really know where to start...
... now they're just Ignoring me.
They won't answer my calls.
It makes me so sad...
... I feel llke I'm not needed at home,
as If I'm not there...
... 'cause there's
always a way to be happy
and we just have to find lt.
Happy.
That's exactly my problem.
That I can't be happy.
I never have been.
Not even when good things
happen to me.
You can't imagine what it means
to wake up every day
with no motivation.
The effort it takes me
to find a reason.
Just one.
Not to let it all go to Hell.
And believe me
I give it my best shot.
My very best.
Every day of my life.
MONDAY
... we have time for one last call...
We're late.
That's enough!
Enough messing around!
Stop playing with your bag!
Got your lunch?
You got it?
Come on, quick.
Ursula!
What's up?
Nothing.
I was just saying good morning.
Morning.
Come on, let's go.
Good morning.
...I was thinking
we could use gauze.
Yeah and bring me the catalogues.
Okay, we'll finish them
in leather...
Okay, we'll be in touch. Ciao.
Morning, César!
Miss Clara. Everything all right?
Everything's great.
Hello, Verónica!
Well, that's us for today.
You're up earlier every morning.
What choice do I have? Poor Rocío...
She can't hold it long... you know.
We're off upstairs.
What time is it?
I'm off.
César!
I think my sink's blocked.
Could you take a look?
I'll stop by this afternoon.
Thanks! Ciao.
Bye.
Morning.
Morning, César.
Morning.
Morning.
Hi, Mum.
How you feeling?
So, what have I got
to tell you today?
The truth is I haven't got
much news.
The neighbours
are behaving themselves.
Most of them.
My only worry is Clara.
I'm trying my best.
But I think it's going to be
tougher than I thought.
But I don't want you worrying.
I'll think of something.
Afternoon.
Do you know what time it is?
Obviously not.
It's 4:26 pm.
Not bad...
You've beaten
your own record.
Sorry, I was visiting my Mother...
Today it's your mother's fault.
Yesterday it was the radio's fault
for putting you to sleep.
Look, you have hours to keep.
And if it's 4, it's 4.
César, what a stroke of luck!
We've got a problem.
Well, I'm sure we'll solve it.
Last warning, eh?
What's the problem?
This afternoon my friend's
celebrating her birthday.
And at the bingo hall... I ask you!
That's good, isn't it?
It's about my little ones...
I feel awful leaving them alone.
Don't worry...
I'll take care of them.
Really?
It's no trouble.
You just have to give them dinner.
But remember,
Rocío has her own special food.
The yellow container,
not more than two measures.
That's it. If not, the poor girl
gets indigestion.
Then she gets such
terrible diarrhoea...
I know. Don't worry.
Oh, and I left you a piece
of pie in the kitchen.
I made it myself. Potato.
Delicious!
I'd best be off
or I won't get a seat!
Enjoy yourself!
Same to you!
Why can't we ask Dad?
As if we'd ask him!
We'll go hand in hand to ask him!
Evening.
How was your day?
Uff... Crazy!
Neighbours going out, mail,
neighbours coming in.
I thought I was going crazy.
Okay. You can relax.
It's my turn to clean
up their posh shit.
And their dogs?
And don't I do anything?
You... Just keep quiet.
The kid's right. He cleans too.
Their posh shit.
Each to his own, no?
So, what about you?
All day sitting there,
doing nothing.
Well, I wouldn't swap this
for anything.
Yeah, I bet.
Look who's talking.
Bet you'd love to be in his shoes.
Oh yeah, that's my dream...
Fuck, Mum!
Don't give me lip!
Here, the office keys.
Afterwards,
leave them in the cupboard.
Yeah, like always.
Here. Up you go.
Potato.
Delicious.
Hi Clara.
So you don't like bugs,
eh Clara?
TUESDAY
At it again?
What the hell are you doing?
What about you, dickhead?
That's the question.
I gave you what you asked for.
Yeah.
But you didn't expect that 60 shitty
euros would keep me quiet forever.
Or do you think I'm stupid?
What do you want?
An adult movie.
What?
You heard me.
Ok.
Now get to bed.
Morning.
Morning, dear.
You haven't got Rocío today.
No.
The poor thing isn't well.
I don't know.
She must have eaten something.
She's got awful diarrhoea.
And with her age, I'm scared that...
You should start getting used to the idea.
Even though it's painful.
Yes.
And how was bingo?
I DREAMT ABOUT YOU AGAIN LAST NIGHT.
YOU CAN BE SUCH A WHORE...
ERASE ALL
Excuse me.
Ah...
César.
Yes, César.
What?
Yesterday I spoke to the estate agency.
And they want to know
how the cleaning woman is doing.
Whether you're satisfied.
It seems some of the neighbours
have complained.
I haven't noticed,
to be honest.
But I can ask.
If it's no bother, please.
I need an answer soon.
Yeah, I'll ask.
Thanks... and sorry.
Morning.
Morning Miss Clara.
Sleep well?
You seem tired...
Yes, you're right.
Lately I wake up feeling awful.
And it isn't lack of sleep.
César, don't call me Miss...
It feels strange.
I'd prefer to.
It helps me in my work.
As you wish.
Late today, aren't you?
What's the time?
Oh no! And I think
I've lost my watch.
Was it valuable?
For me it was.
It was my mother's...
Oh, I stopped by your apartment...
You do have a blockage.
I'll go back this afternoon
with the drain cleaner.
Great. I've got to run.
Thanks.
And if you find a watch anywhere...
Sure everything's okay?
Yeah.
Ciao.
What the hell?
I've still got 5 min...
What are you doing here?
Shouldn't you be at school?
What do you care?
You got what I asked for?
This where you live?
What a dive!
But it's not like
you spend much time here.
Here. Enjoy it.
What?
It's what you wanted, isn't it?
Have you seen it?
Now go.
I bumped into Clara in the lift.
We were talking...
about you.
What did you say?
Are you worried?
You mean she doesn't know?
What did you say?
Nothing.
But from now on we'll have
to raise the price...
About 100 euros.
Make sure nobody catches
you with that.
What is it today?
Just finishing lunch.
Had a hectic morning.
Yes.
You don't go up
to the rooftop much, eh?
What?
What do you mean what?
You were instructed
to water the plants.
You were told not
to water at midday.
But of course
you couldn't give a damn!
Look at them, all dead.
Look at the Musas.
Dead.
Do you have any idea
what they cost?
Such ugly plants?
You should have seen his face.
The Musas.
Today was a good day, Mum.
Now, there's just Clara.
She's a tough one, eh?
Always that smile.
All good, all great!
All great.
Anyway, I think we're
on the right track.
We'll wipe that smile off her face.
She just needs...
an extra push.
Ah, one more thing...
This morning the office workers
came to see me.
I don't want to butt in, but...
I'd be a bit more careful
if I were you.
What did they say?
They complained about
the state of the office.
That's not true.
I go over it all...
Shut up!
They're pretty angry.
They wanted to speak to the agency.
But I told them to wait.
I'd talk to you.
Mum, I swear...
Just shut it!
I've fucking had it!
I'm really sorry.
That's what they told me.
I'll clean with him today.
And César...
Thanks.
Think nothing of it.
Hello?
Hi, baby.
I've already had dinner.
No, I sleep well.
But then it's a real effort to wake up.
And I spend all day feeling groggy.
Yeah, text messages all day,
a couple of emails and letters.
Yeah, I've talked
to the police again.
It seems the emails
are sent from cyber cafés.
So they can't do much.
They said I shouldn't worry.
Probably just some nut
who doesn't even know me.
I dropped my papers...
Oh, I feel dizzy...
No, I'm fine. It was nothing.
You and doctors!
Yes, he said it's stress.
And I should take it easy.
Yes, of course.
If I tell my boss
I'm going to see you in San Francisco,
he'll have a heart attack!
Ah, I found my watch.
It must have fallen down the sink
and the concierge wrecked it
with drain cleaner...
You're so cruel!
No, poor guy.
He didn't know.
He even left me a note.
Okay.
Night night.
I love you.
I think it's time we got serious.
WEDNESDAY
What's this?
Morning.
Morning.
How are you feeling today?
Better.
Doesn't look like it.
Hell, César!
You know how to treat a woman,
don't you?
With the time I've spent
in front of the mirror...
But you're right.
Too much make-up, no?
No... just that rash
doesn't look too good.
It'll get better.
Gordi! Yes, yes, of course...
THURSDAY
Dear Clara, I thlnk It's time
to stop foollng around.
I thought you'd have guessed
who I was by now.
You've no Idea how sad It
makes me that you've forgotten.
Because I've been thlnklng
about you all these years.
I went to the dermatologist.
It's an allergy.
He gave me a pill
and it should be gone in a few days.
I've olten followed you
to the metro.
I was so close
I could even smell you.
You stank of make-up.
And lately you aren't
looklng good.
You look fucklng slck.
Morning, Miss Clara.
Morning. Sorry.
Ciao.
In a hurry, isn't she?
The truth is I don't know
how she stands it.
Maybe she's a little bit like you.
A nut who finds vlctims
at random, eh?
Here we go Clara.
Here we go...
MONDAY
César, you have to help me!
Come with me.
My apartment's full of bugs.
The bedroom...
It's that way, César.
Where?
At the end of the hall.
Cockroaches.
You stay there, alright?
Hurry up, please, César.
Are you there?
Yes!
In the wardrobe. Grab me a dress.
Which one?
The grey one.
There are two.
The first one you see.
Shake it out well, please.
Got it.
And shoes, the brown ones.
Dark brown?
No, no, no!
So light brown?
Hurry, please!
Thanks. Hurry.
And my bag, shake it, please.
It looks like you've got
quite an infestation.
It's so disgusting, César!
And to think I was sleeping in there!
Shit.
Maybe you bought some rotten fruit
and there were eggs inside.
These bugs breed in a few days.
Gross! Eggs...
So what should I do?
Well, fumigate.
You'll have to clean
the whole apartment.
They breed so quickly.
And could you fumigate it?
Yes? Great!
Meanwhile, I'll stay at Mum's.
No, but I think you should stay.
Stay here? No chance!
You saw what it was like.
No, but I'll have to throw out
a lot of stuff.
It's better for you to stay.
Doesn't matter.
If something has to be thrown out...
just call me.
Anyway, it was time
for a spring clean.
I'm serious. I need...
What do I do with your clothes?
My clothes? Fumigate them.
Put them in a bag,
and I'll take them to the cleaner's.
What have you done, César?
What's up?
I've got a bug infestation
in my apartment.
Eggs and everything.
You should go back to the doctor's.
It doesn't look good.
Ah no, it's going now.
You should have seen it before.
The cream seems to be working.
I've been having a run
of bad luck lately...
Let's hope it ends soon.
Is he still harassing you?
What?
That nutter...
the one who's sending you messages.
How do you know about that?
I think you told Verónica...
You know her.
Yes, he's still harassing me.
She said you knew him...
a friend of yours or something.
Ah no, it was false alarm.
The police investigated.
My friend's been living in Geneva
for years.
Whoever it is uses a prepaid
phone so they can't trace him.
But the police located the signal
or whatever and...
He's sending them from here.
What do you mean here?
Someone in the building.
That's how he knows me.
But he doesn't know they know.
So while he keeps sending messages,
they can tighten the net around him.
So sooner or later they'll get him.
Because he isn't going
to stop today, is he?
I doubt it.
Here, my number.
Once it's fumigated, call me.
Yes, don't worry.
Things are getting complicated.
I think I've taken things too far.
You know I'd never gone
this far with anybody.
Because I was so hopeful.
For the first time
I had a reason to live.
I haven't been up
to the roof for days.
And I hadn't even realised.
And all this for what?
For that bitch to keep smiling
every day like nothing's happened.
Happy.
And me back to square one.
So those are reasons enough,
aren't they?
You'd love that, wouldn't you?
You'd love that.
To get rid of the piece of shit
you gave birth to.
But no.
Not yet.
First, I'll wipe the smile off
that bitch's face.
Whatever it takes.
Oh, what have we got here...
What a waste of space you are.
And it isn't just me who thinks that.
I've got your references.
It seems you don't last long
in any job.
Three and a half months,
Balmes 53...
One month, Aribau 14...
One month!
Odd, isn't it?
What I'm saying
is you should start looking again.
Because you... here...
WEDNESDAY
Afternoon.
Is there a problem?
Can we have a word, please?
Yes.
You can't do this.
We won't be long.
The IP matches...
They were sent from here.
Yesterday at 8:18, Tuesday at 8:24...
That's impossible.
Nobody's here at that time.
Anyone else have access
to the office?
That's the time
when they're cleaning.
Apparently he helps his mother,
but judging
from the neighbours'complaints...
Well, now we know what
he was really doing.
Hello?
Miss Clara, it's César.
HI César.
How's It golng?
Good.
I'm calling to tell you
I finished fumigating.
It's all clean...
Problem solved.
Great...
I can't walt to get home.
You heard about the cleaner's son?
Yes, I know.
So, come home whenever you want.
I took the liberty
of cleaning up a bit.
There was no need. Really.
But thanks anyway.
So I'll be back tonlght.
Yes.
Thanks for everythlng, César.
Think nothing of it.
I'm ready.
I can't wait!
I've still got some marks,
on my back.
I'll shut my eyes.
You're so silly!
What's that smell?
Shush!
Shit.
THURSDAY
When you get up,
I need you to help put
that cream on my back.
Come back to bed, Mimi.
No, come on.
I'm so happy.
Lately I've been waking up fine again.
Maybe that's all it was,
I needed you here.
And for that guy
to stop screwing with you.
Yeah, that too.
The cleaner... What a nerve.
And while he was working
with his mother.
I don't want to talk
about that, baby.
It's over.
Mimi?
What are these things?
What things?
Under the bed.
Wait, I can't hear you.
There's a sports bag here...
What is all this stuff?
No idea. It isn't mine.
What do you mean?
It's not yours?
No, how strange.
Strange no, Mimi.
There'll be an explanation?
The concierge was here fumigating.
It'll be his.
And he left his stuff under your bed?
What is this?
Looks like a diary.
And that key?
Marcos...
What's the matter?
Are you dizzy?
Here.
Wait, have another pillow.
You're not better yet.
I don't care what the doctor says.
I'm really worried.
I'm feeling OK now.
Sure?
Yes.
I'm even hungry.
That's a good sign.
I love you.
I'll fix breakfast. Okay?
What do you fancy?
Juice.
Which kind?
Orange and banana.
No, kiwi.
There's nothing in the fridge, Mimi...
Ah, that's right.
What'll we do?
Well, let's go out for breakfast.
OK. And we'll get some shopping.
Milk...
...and cereal.
Nutella...
What?
Nutella.
Milk, cereal...
Bread...
Oranges...
Let's go downstairs for a coffee.
No.
They charge you 4 euros just for
writing your name on the cup.
You're so stingy!
You make up any name you want.
You could be...
Get in the shower, I'm starving.
Why don't we shower together?
And if we go back to bed?
Why do we have to get up?
Because we have things to do.
What things?
You can't spend all day in bed.
The first morning I'm feeling fine.
We could go away for a few days.
Where to?
I don't know... away.
We could stay at home and relax.
We'll rent some movies.
Yeah, and you fall asleep
in ten seconds.
OK, but before we're going
to the doctor's.
I'm serious.
What's the matter?
What are you doing here?
Who the fuck are you?
How did you get in?
What are YOU doing here?
This isn't your apartment...
I'll ring the police.
I'm warning you.
He's the concierge.
Miss Clara, you're here.
César, what are you doing here?
I'm really sorry.
I wanted to tell you this morning.
But I didn't see you.
I left my fumigation gear
in the bedroom...
What's worse,
Miss Verónica's keys are there.
God!
You scared us to death!
I'm really sorry.
You can't just come into people's
apartments without permission.
Sorry. But Miss Verónica
was asking for her keys...
And I didn't want to admit
I'd lost them.
They could sack me.
Relax, they're here.
I'll get them, okay?
Are you here for a while?
Do you use a saw
to fumigate insects?
No.
Why are you wet?
There was a burst pipe...
A total disaster.
Thank you so much.
You're looking a lot better.
Yes, these few days away
have been good.
Thank you, Miss Clara.
I'm really sorry.
By the way, César,
how much do
I owe you for fumigating?
Nothing.
You don't owe me anything.
Just don't say anything
about the keys and we're even.
Don't worry about that.
But I'll pay for your work.
We're square.
Thank you.
And welcome back.
To you too.
And sorry again.
You've really made it
easy for me.
Today you've beaten
your own record.
This is your letter of dismissal.
You've got 15 days
to vacate the flat.
You can appeal,
but I don't advise it.
Are you sure you're alright?
Yes, don't worry,
I'll find something.
I don't know
what's come over them.
Because they also sacked
the cleaning lady.
She'd been with us for years.
Know that my babies and
I have absolutely
no complaints about you.
Quite the contrary.
You know that, don't you?
Oh César,
we're going to miss you.
And if you're going out
with your girl, don't worry.
Put it in the fridge and eat it
tomorrow, or the next day.
It keeps well.
You're very good Miss Verónica.
No.
I don't understand
why you're single.
No kids and no partner,
and it'll just get harder.
You're old.
And you'll get older.
It's a shame you have
to waste away in that apartment.
Because the dogs help, of course.
But we know they aren't children.
Just mutts.
Let's not kid ourselves.
Because I see.
I spend hours here.
The neighbours talk...
I realise.
They pretend to listen to you...
But it's pity.
Really, they couldn't care less.
So don't trust them.
Believe me.
You're past it.
And terribly alone.
And believe me...
there's no remedy for that.
Thanks for the stew.
Excuse me.
Hello.
Hello, Verónica!
I'm off again.
But just for the weekend.
Are you feeling all right?
Sure?
Hello, César.
Are you going for long?
No, just four days, until Sunday.
Come on Clara.
The doctor's is at 6.
Where are you off to?
Away.
Have a good weekend, César.
Hello, César.
I'd just like to thank
you for the programme.
You've helped me a lot.
So tell us, what Is It that stops you
from belng happy?
That's exactly my problem.
I can't be happy.
I never have been.
I thlnk I was born without
that capaclty.
Llke belng born bllnd or deaf.
But even worse...
You can't lmaglne what It Is to wake up
every mornlng with no motivation.
The effort I have to make not
to let It all go to hell.
And the only thlng that helps me
Is that others are unhappy too.
And belleve me
I glve It my best shot.
My very best.
That's why I want to thank you
for what you do.
You've helped me a lot.
Really.
But It doesn't matter anymore.
I don't see
why you're so worked up.
What do you want me to do?
Throw myself out the window?
How do you expect me to react?
How?
By trusting me, for example.
Mimi...
Can we try to talk like grown ups?
I swear I'm trying to.
I know, darling.
But I haven't seen you for...
six weeks.
And we always use a condom.
Always!
I've got a right
to be surprised at least.
Surprised, yes. So am I!
It's one thing to be surprised,
but to insinuate...
No.
I'm not insinuating anything.
I'm just saying it seems
a little strange, that's all.
You heard the doctor.
It can happen.
You are only 4 weeks pregnant.
But the doctor said! Fuck!
It's technically possible.
Yes... technically.
Go to Hell!
Leave me alone, please...
Our affair is starting to bear fruit,
eh Clara?
Maybe I haven't done such
a bad job after all.
It's a pity our time
is running out...
FRIDAY
Hi.
I asked for you at the desk
and they told me you'd be here...
What's up?
It seems like Clara's still got
some bugs.
You might have
to spray the place again.
Could you take a look...
if you don't mind?
Yes.
Hang on.
Come in.
I can't see anything.
No?
Look closely.
Maybe in the bedroom.
And Miss Clara?
She isn't here.
Don't worry about her.
What's that?
What the fuck is all that?
What is it?
How long have you been
coming in here?
How long have you been
coming in here?
Five weeks.
Five weeks. What?
Clara doesn't mind.
Clara doesn't know anything!
What did you do to her?
I kept her company, not like you.
What did you do to her?
What did you do to her?
Can't you guess?
It's technically possible.
César Manso?
Please.
This way.
This is the concierge.
No. I told him
I no longer work here.
Right...
Come with me, please.
Can you give us a moment, please?
Do you know this man?
Yes.
Yes...
He's Miss Blas' boyfriend.
What's happened?
It looks like suicide.
We're not sure.
Suicide?
We'll see.
Seen any unfamiliar people
coming into the building today?
No.
I don't think so.
Are you sure?
I told you,
I don't work here anymore.
I wouldn't know.
Right...
I understand that you have
the keys to all the apartments.
Yes, as concierge
I had access to the keys.
Is something wrong?
I know Miss Blas quite well.
I'd like to offer my condolences...
Now is not the time.
I saw you!
Looking for me?
Dad.
Mum.
Relax, they're just sleeping.
If I were you, I wouldn't scream.
My brother?
What are you going to do to me?
Dad!
Listen to me.
I've done terrible things to Clara.
And, yes, I was involved
in her boyfriend's death.
Let's not kid ourselves.
Know why I'm telling you this?
Because I want you to know
what I'm capable of.
I know everything about Clara...
But also about you.
I know which school you go to.
I know where
your grandmother lives.
I've seen your twitter profile.
I know who your friends are.
Vanesa.
Katia.
Sofia.
So if you say anything...
I know how to hurt you...
Badly...
You and your family.
Understand?
Understand?
And if not...
Morning.
Leaving?
Yes.
It looks like you're in a hurry.
I told you I no longer work here...
Yes, of course.
But I'd like to ask you
a few questions.
Shall we?
There isn't much to see.
Don't worry.
I'm not sure how I can help you.
I thought it was suicide.
That's the problem.
We aren't completely sure.
The thing is we've found your prints
all over the apartment...
in the most unlikely spots...
Yes.
Miss Blas asked me to fumigate
her apartment a few days ago.
And I was...
Yes... She told us.
She also told us
how you met Mr. Bazán...
Who?
Her boyfriend.
The deceased.
Ah... yes.
It was quite an awkward situation.
I can imagine.
But I never got to know him well.
I mean... I don't know what their
relationship was like.
You get me.
No, I don't get you.
What do you mean?
I don't know...
It's all a bit awkward.
Awkward?
Well.
If you want we'll talk about
something else.
Let's say I'm not sure things
were exactly harmonious.
No?
The other night
I heard them arguing...
Okay...
Miss Blas told us
they were having some problems.
I don't know anything.
And I barely knew him.
But the day it happened...
he seemed quite upset.
Upset?
Upset how?
I don't know...
Nervous.
Slightly out of it.
I see...
But it'd be better
to ask the girl who lives opposite.
Really?
She told me she saw him on the landing
and got quite a fright...
But she'd be able to explain better...
Yes.
We'll ask her.
Thank you...
Think nothing of it.
Miss Clara, finally.
How are you feeling?
I didn't think I'd see you again...
I wanted to tell you how sorry I am.
It was a horrible tragedy.
I can't imagine
what you're going through.
Well, thank you.
Thank you for your help.
Goodbye.
I hope to see you smiling again.
Are you happy now, you bastard?
Well no.
Not yet.
Clara.
A letter.
