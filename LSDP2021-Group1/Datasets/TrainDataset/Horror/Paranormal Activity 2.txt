Welcome home, Hunter.
This is your house.
Gonna look out of that window.
There's your front door.
Hi, Dad.
How are you?
-  Happy.
-  Hi, little man.
We got to keep him
out of the sun, too, OK?
Yeah.
How are you feeling?
Guess who changed
the first, like, 15 diapers?
- This guy, right here.
- Wait, wait.
Guess who was in labor
for a day?
- This girl.
- I've been in labor for...
- Hi.
-  That's your mama.
Hi. Hunter, this is Martine,
your new nanny.
She will probably
fix your dirty diapers
- because I won't.
-  Can I see?
Yes.
Oh, my goodness. Look at this.
-  He's cute, right?
- Isn't he adorable?
He's kind of smooshy
looking. I'm not gonna lie.
He's just newborn,
he's a newborn...
Seriously,
the cutest baby ever,
next to me. Second to me.
Just touch him
and cuddle him all day long.
You see how tiny he is?
Do you mind if I take him?
Not if he's sleeping,
but I want to take him
on a tour of the house.
Mm. OK. He's not sleeping.
That's Abby.
Gonna be your best friend.
Bye, sweetie.
This is a fireplace.
This is how Mommy seduced
Daddy...
-  Oh.
-  ...and that's
how we got you.
And that's why you're watching
this video at 25.
This is your room.
There's your crib.
It's a little sparse right now.
Just got some
caterpillar action going on.
"Hunter." See? Pretty cool.
This is your sister's
trashed room.
-  No, I'll
check with him.
-  Oh, there she is.
Wassup, brother
from another mother?
-  What?
- No, Hunter's in...
You're never allowed to come in
here, ever. Unless I invite you.
In which case, it's gonna be
the best day of your life.
By the way, that's my bathroom.
Don't ever go in there.
That's half your bathroom.
It's actually my bathroom,
'cause I bought it.
All that is mine.
Don't pee on my seat!
This is the living room
that no one ever uses.
This is my first man cave.
That's where all
my genius ideas come.
This is the second man cave,
where we're gonna watch
Chargers games together.
This is my 50-inch monster.
Look at that. It's beautiful.
-
-
I don't even know
if I swaddled him right.
It's just... Yeah.
Hi, baby boy. Hi. Hi.
-  He smells good.
- Yes.
-
- You're just like Daddy.
You make poops all the time.
- Is that good?
-S?.
OK.
Is a special baby??
- Thank you.
-  That is so cute.
-
-  I'll get it!
- Hey! Let me see this baby.
-  Hi!
-  Aunt Katie!
-  Where is he?
He's upstairs.
Hi.
Hi. Hi.
You are so
precious.
Hi.
I already love you so much.
- My sister did good.
-  Yeah.
You probably had a little
part in it, I don't know.
-  Very little.
- Hi.
It's her boyfriend.
Yeah, he's a big boy,
just like his...
Kinda just
eating cookies.
Hello, baby.
-  Dad, my burger?
- Or whatever.
- Right, sorry.
-  Gimme another plate.
-  Nice.
- Did you get that?
I want you to meet...
- Wait.
- ...my Aunt Katie.
Does it stay on?
It does stay on,
but I didn't want to get it wet.
Oh, no, of course not.
That would be ridiculous.
- That would ruin it.
-  That is so...
- Swear to God, I will kill you.
-  Look at that, perfect.
Perfect handoff right there.
She's my only niece.
Not really, but I think of her
as my niece.
She's my step-niece.
-  Aww.
-
- I'm the evil step-aunt.
- Step?
The evil step-aunt?
I'm not sure how to take that.
I'm not sure...
Well, I'm not really evil,
but I can be evil is my point.
-
-  Dad,
the face came off!
-
-
- There can be only one!
- I will not let you go.
I can't believe
he's over a year old.
-  Where's Micah?
- Oh, he, um...
He wasn't up
for hanging out today.
I can't find the tape.
That's fine, I'm just
gonna tape over an old one.
Can you get Abby out of here,
please? She's gonna get cut on
the glass!
We just got back and the whole
place has been just destroyed.
Nothing seems to be missing.
It's just, everything's
really...
But that's what
she's telling me.
Make sure we document
everything. Don't touch
anything.
This is our foyer.
The furniture's damaged.
My daughter Ali's room.
It just feels... gross
that somebody was in here.
Master bedroom.
Yeah, so that's great.
- Your watches are still there?
-  Yeah.
Diamonds are here.
The only thing missing
is the necklace
my sister made me.
Oh, sweetie.
This is horrible.
It's fucking horrible.
It's the nursery.
As far as I know,
this room was not touched.
This is our basement.
I don't see anything really
broken. I don't know if
there's anything...
I don't think they
did anything down here. I...
- What is that?
-  Hm?
Is that Abby?
It really stinks, though.
- Oh.
-  Well, clothes
are still here.
Your bikes are still here.
- Not that you're using those.
- And your bike
is over here, so...
-  And the
epic clean continues.
- It's not so bad, right?
- This looks like
we had a party.
-
- Right?
-  Worst party ever.
I don't know, kiddo.
This is messed up.
What are you
talking about? They didn't
take anything. We're fine.
-
-  You're fine.
So this is it. Um...
Like I said, about a week ago,
- the place was
completely trashed.
-  Hello.
- Hello.
- That's our daughter, Ali.
Pretty much every room in the
house. We had both doors locked.
Put one up here,
up in the corner,
and then you get
the whole stairway,
the front door,
this whole hallway.
One over there,
facing this way,
you'd get this door
and this door.
Or have one in here,
getting all these
windows, the sliding...
They run, like,
all the time?
Yeah, they're
always recording.
You can't get away
with anything.
That stuff.
Corner up there, so you get
who's coming in and out
- of this door, that door.
- Bathroom.
And you get to see
the baby at night, too.
You're not putting one
in my bathroom, right?
- Yeah. What?
-  Wait.
Put a camera that sees in
complete dark. It'd be perfect.
- Yeah, really?
- Yeah, oh, yeah.
- Yeah, OK, that'd be sweet.
- They'll look like
motion detectors.
Little tiny hole.
I have one I could show you.
-  Can you put one
in that bunny?
- Very cool.
And then we can,
I can set you up with the...
Yeah, so, I'm gonna close
it up there like that.
It's hidden.
Can't even tell it's a camera.
How many are we getting?
I don't know. But what'd you...?
What, is that... six?
- I don't know.
- One, two, three...
What are you doing
out here, little buddy?
Yeah. Go get it.
You're super fast, big man.
What's Martine doing?
What is she doing?
-
He's good, right?
-
You're a good puppy.
What you say, Abby?
Hey, Hunter. Hunter,
you want another fishy?
What are you doing?
What you doing?
What's up, Martine?
- Wassup? What's up, Ali?
-
What were you doing?
What were you doing earlier?
When you were, like,
talking to yourself?
All crazy like.
Are you going crazy here, too?
No... crazy.
You're just
getting it from all of us.
The house is...
There are bad things
in the house?
No.
-  You're getting
rid of spirits.
- Uh-huh.
-  OK. All right.
-
- The good ones...
-
-  We keep the good ones.
- Yes.
In with the good,
out with the bad.
Yay!
In with the paella,
out with the...
Holy crap,
that's a lot of garlic.
- Whee!
-
One, two, three. Whee!
-
- One, two, three.
Whee!
Oh, I almost got him.
- One, two...
-
Oh, my God!
Look at what Martine left!
-  Oh!
-  Disgusting!
I wanna throw up! It...
-  Ohh!
- She put it in the freaking...
-  No, you! That was you!
- It's not me!
-  Don't blame
somebody else!
- Hand to God!
God, there was like
a live crawdaddy in there.
- She clogged it. I can't look.
-  That is a stench-ilada.
- That is horrible.
You're grounded.
-  I'm not capable of...
You are grounded. Awful.
This is the best bath...
-  It looks pretty good.
- ...I've... I think it...
Well, if you come in,
it'll be the best bath
I've ever...
It's so quiet and, like,
there's nobody here.
It's fantastic.
I love Martine, but
I'm kind of loving the fact
that she's not here.
- Yeah.
-  What time
is your sister coming?
Um... What time is it now?
7:20. Something like that.
- Oh, like an hour or so.
-  Hm.
You should definitely pop in.
I don't want to smash you,
but I kind of want to get in.
You don't want to smash me?
I kinda want you to smash me.
-  Really? Oh.
- Yeah.
- Let me release the Kraken.
-
Hey.
You're OK.
Aw. Aw. I gotcha.
You're OK. You're OK.
Look, it's perfect, right?
-  That's a lot
of grease in there.
-  I'm gonna drain it.
Here, goofy mug.
Do you need anything?
-  Hey!
- Mm, are you making breakfast?
- Thank you so much.
- How you doing?
- I was, but, uh...
-Hola.
-  Did he keep you up?
- Yeah, yeah.
- He definitely kept me up.
-  Yeah, he does that.
I love you so much.
- I love you so much.
- Thank you so much.
- I love you so much.
-  Aw.
You're amazing. I don't think
I'm really awake yet, though.
There's coffee.
? I love my sister
She's the best ?
Remember that time
you tried to be a vegan
- for like six hours?
- A day and a half?
- That was a difficult time.
- It was for one meal.
- Making bacon?
- Yeah.
- Good morning.
-  Yo, yo, yo, what up?
Thank you for loaning out
your beautiful girlfriend
for the night.
-  What up?
- She made my day.
- Tell me that's not yours.
-  It's not
really mine, no.
Thanks for not watching
the sausage for us, Ali.
I did watch it!
It's mine and hers.
She uses it most.
Cool. It's HD.
Do I get some love, too?
-
-  What?
-
-  You scared
little Hunter.
How's it going?
Can I get you some coffee?
- Dude, I have a bone
to pick with you.
-  Yeah?
I went into Burger King,
and I was like, hey, man.
I tossed your name around
and they didn't give me
any free food, dude.
- I don't own, like,
every Burger King.
-
-  He's not actually
the king of Burger King.
- I'm not?
I'm still in the process
of easing him in to the fact
that we live together
and, therefore, the house should
represent the both of us.
Well, yeah, but the both
of us, like, a give and take.
Like you have your beading thing
or whatever it is,
and then I have my area,
you know?
- The whole rest of the house?
-  Of manliness.
I'm telling you,
that baby's gonna be
a rock star when he grows up.
Yeah, get it. Whoa!
Dad, careful, are you
watching that?
There was no sign
of forced entry, but...
They trashed our whole house.
I mean, I think it was more
vandalism.
See that thing in the corner?
Looks like a motion detector?
- Are you, like...?
-  That's a camera.
We're watching you!
You like
little wheels that roll.
You're such a ham.
Such a ham. Are you leaving?
Things have gotten
a little difficult
since he learned how
to open the door.
- Aw.
-
So are you freaked
out after the break in?
Yeah, I mean,
I definitely was. I don't
think I was sleeping very well.
Oh, sweetie? Sweetie.
I would be freaked out,
too, if, you know,
somebody had broken
into my house.
Well, it's just,
they didn't take anything.
You know?
- Yeah.
- I don't know.
It seemed personal.
It feels like they're always
still here.
You know? I don't know, I...
I get this feeling,
like when we were little.
What?
Mm. Never mind.
-
- Mac and cheese,
- mac and cheese.
- Hey, Kris?
I'm gonna go out.
I'm not gonna be in.
- Oh, OK. Where are you going?
- Just the mall.
All right, well, have fun.
-  Bye!
- Bye!
Mac and cheese.
Mac and cheese.
-
-  No?
Hey,
what's up there?
Let's look at baby Hunter.
Boy, that one was bad.
That's that bee bonnet
that the...
He's like, that was
totally humiliating.
Nobody needs to see this.
- Oh, this is crazy.
-  What?
- Who do you think that is?
-  Is that you?
No, that's your Aunt Katie.
That's...
-  That's Katie?
- That's so weird.
I thought we lost all
our pictures in the fire.
That's great.
-  Yo, Martine?
- Uh-huh.
Kristi and Dad
are out tonight.
- I'm going out tonight.
- Uh-huh.
You gonna have your
boyfriend over? Have a party?
-
-  Yeah.
-EsteBrad.Novio.
-  Yeah.
He, he boy.
- ...want handsy,
handsy, touchy. No.
-
"No."
-  The handsy,
handsy, touchy?
- The handsy-handsy?.
Is that the kind of dance you
were showing me, the Handsy?
Shake it.
-
-
-
-
-
-
I thought I was gonna have
to give him the Heimlich.
Hey, what are
you doing?
That's enough, Martine.
Put it down.
Martine,
he's fine.
I've asked you
not to do this, OK?
It is not good
for the baby.
- Please, put it out right now.
-
No m?s, no m?s.
That's enough.
Put it out right now, please.
- OK, that's enough.
-
What are you doing?
- The baby is fine, OK?
- No, no.
The baby should not
be breathing that.
Nobody should.
-
- No, I don't...
Just stop doing it, please.
Goddamn it.
God.
OK, that's like two months.
All right?
- OK? I told you.
-S?.
I do understand, OK?
I just,
I don't believe
in that stuff, OK?
It's just... I cannot have that
stuff in my house. OK?
-  OK.
-  I'm sorry.
Can I give you a great
recommendation, OK?
You were very good for us.
-
-
Da-da.
Come on, make Daddy proud.
Say, "Da-da."
Hunter, look over here.
Hunter?
You are so like your dad.
Sweetie. Sweetie?
Come on, come on.
What are you looking at?
- Look at Mama.
-
Look at Mama.
-
- Buddy? What? What? Oh.
Look over here.
There's nothing there, goofball.
Where are you going?
Hunter?
I can't see you back there.
We were up in the nursery,
playing, and I was trying
to get him to say "Da-da" again,
and he just wouldn't focus.
He was looking
at the ceiling and mirror,
- everywhere but me.
- Well, he's a baby.
He's got, like, an attention
span of a guppy. You know?
I guess, but there
was definitely
something he was
focused on,
and it wasn't
my pretty face.
-  Hey.
- What are you doing?
- What's going on?
-  Nothing much.
Check this out.
- Dad, can you
please not do that?
-  Yeah, night vision.
Cool, I'm gonna get nail polish
on the bed. Please?
You got freaky eyes.
You look like a possum.
Dad.
- There we go.
- Painting my nails, Dad.
Why are you in here?
What do you want?
-  Sorry, crabby.
- I'm not crabby.
You're Crabby McRumpelstein.
- Why did I fire Martine?
- Yeah.
Because I didn't like her
doing all that weird
- witchy stuff around Hunter.
- It wasn't witchy.
It wasn't witchy...
It wasn't hurting anybody.
It made her feel better,
and she wanted to make us
feel better.
She was, like, slaughtering
goats out by the pool, OK?
-  No, she wasn't.
- All right.
Good luck and it's...
Stay in the lines.
- What? Dad!
-  Check it.
-  On! Stop!
-  Off.
Let me get one more. Oh!
-
- Aw, come here.
Shh.
Come here, come on.
It's OK. It's OK, buddy.
It's OK.
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
Ah, no.
It's OK, buddy,
there's nothing there.
Is that what
woke you up, buddy?
-
-
-
-
-
-  Daniel!
Daniel?
God. Nasty.
Dad, don't pick it up
with your hands.
-  Why not?
-  Because it could,
like...
They can have diseases
and stuff...
- It flew into the window...
-  It's so sad.
I don't even want to look at it.
-  What?
- Its neck is all broken.
Oh, my God,
just put it in the thing!
I'm trying to...
Why did you
pick it up with tong...?
-  I don't know.
- What do you think?
-  Stop!
- Medium, medium rare?
-  You're really mean.
- It's just a dead bird.
- Oh.
- It was a live bird.
And then it...
-  It's really sad.
- OK.
You like the ball?
You like ball?
Ball, ball, hit it. Smack it!
What's in there? Get in.
What's in there?
-
-  Oh, buddy.
Buddy, buddy, buddy, buddy.
Hunter? Oh, shit.
Hunter, come here! Come here.
-
-
Fuck!
What are you doing
back out here? Go.
Your dog does
not like pool cleaners.
Yo, what's the deal
with your dog?!
Honestly, we're not really sure.
Splash, splash. One, two, three.
Splash, splash, splash.
This is the cutest thing
I've ever seen.
Splash, splash, splash.
I think I might
definitely start
to replace my girlfriend
with this camera.
- Uh-huh. See? We're scared.
-  It's got more
features.
Flip the thing, film yourself.
It flips. Oh, yeah, yeah.
- Oh, shit.
-  Then it shows you...
No. I'm definitely
getting one of these.
I'll bet you guys
go extracurricular with this.
Who has time for that?
We've got a baby.
How's Daniel Rey
and his brood doing?
Oh, apparently, we have a ghost.
Did you hear about this?
I did not. Please
elaborate, 'cause that's
a very strange thing to...
A couple pots fell off our pot
hanger thing in the kitchen.
-  You definitely
have a ghost.
- Straight to ghost.
That's the most logical...
She thinks everything
is, like, a ghost or a...
Don't you, honey?
- What?
-
Duh-duh-duh-duh...
Think everything
is a ghost?
You don't have a ghost.
Yeah, you're definitely
haunted.
- No.
-  You and your sister
are, like, freaky...
Katie, you're
into this stuff?
You don't
know this stuff?
They used to do, like, séances
and shit when they were little.
-  No!
-  Yes.
We didn't do séances.
- No.
-  Who'd you talk to?
You're making a mountain
out of a molehill.
-  Katie...
- Babe, it was really
no big deal.
-  What's no big deal?
- I probably, you know,
I just don't talk about
this stuff anymore.
What stuff?
They used to do séances
when they were little kids.
It's really not that funny.
You're laughing. It's not
a big deal, babe.
The truth is, when we were kids,
we got a little freaked out,
but it's really no big deal.
And we're having a good day
today, so let's just...
We'll explore this
- in detail later.
- Let's focus...
What about the Lizzie Borden
one? The axe murderer one?
You're thinking
of every, like, childhood...
How, where do, how would I...
Back me up...
How would I know this stuff
if you didn't tell us?
What's your take
on this ghost situation?
I think it's awesome.
How could I put it up wrong?
It's on a hook.
Once it goes up, it's up.
You were probably putting it
on the edge of the top part,
instead of inside.
The fact that it fell a second
time probably proves
- that you put it up
wrong both times.
- OK.
You want me to show
you how to put it up?
No, no, no. Then why
are you putting
the pool cleaner
back in every morning?
For the last week?
'Cause it's a pool cleaner,
and I want it to clean the pool.
- How does it get out at night?
-  How does it get out?
- Yeah.
- Is it taking the car?
Is it, like...?
- Oh, come on, honey.
No, really.
- I don't know.
I assume somebody takes it out
when they go swimming.
I don't take it out,
and you don't take it out.
Ali, do you take the pool
cleaner out of the pool?
- What?
- Do you take the pool cleaner
out of the pool?
No.
What? So it's crawling
out of the pool?
It's crawling
out of the pool by itself?
I don't know.
Let's... You know what?
You wanted all the cameras.
Let's go check the DVR.
Fine, let's go check it.
- You serious?
- Yeah, I'm very serious.
We'll find out what else is
going around here at night.
- Can I tape it, though?
- Yeah.
-  What?
-  See?
That is weird.
Maybe I have it set too high
or something, I don't know.
No.
No, I don't, I don't think
the settings are off.
Maybe
the settings are off.
Um...
That's what we got it for.
It's probably trying to be
proactive. Do the little patio.
It's like
one of those vacuum cleaner
things you set up.
Yeah, it's like a Flowbee,
but with...
I don't know if the house
is haunted, but I hope it is.
-  You hope it is?
- Yeah.
Are you kidding me?
That would be fucking awesome.
Why would you hope
that the house is haunted?
That'd be the coolest
thing ever.
If there was somebody trying to,
like, get through to us,
- that would be amazing.
-  No, I just...
Kristi is obviously
not sleeping.
-
-  Dude.
She doesn't have any...
Her hormones are all kooky.
She's got... paranoid mommy...
...just interpreting them
in the wrong way.
Like, she's seeing them as,
as harmful and dangerous.
And maybe we should just
see them as something
trying to, like...
Like, I think we should
have a séance.
- We could go full out... What?
-  That's a great idea.
Just freaky. I don't...
I don't believe in it.
Why do you think that it
necessarily has to be bad,
though?
That's all I'm asking.
-  How would it be good?
- Like, what if it's Mom?
-
-
-
-
-  Hey, guys.
-  What?
There's something
you need to see.
-  What are you
talking about?
-  What's going on?
- You're freaking me out.
- You have to see...
Honey, what are
you talking about?
What are... you talking about?
What is it?
- I don't see anything.
- I don't understand.
-
- Ah-ha-ha!
- Yeah!
- That's not funny.
Yeah!
Sweetie?
Come on,
that was kind of funny, right?
I just, I hate it when you
don't take me seriously.
I'm sorry, honey.
I do take you seriously.
I was just trying to...
I'm just trying
to lighten things up.
I just want us to kind of
get back to normal.
Like I was thinking maybe
we could go out?
- Like... like grownups?
- Yeah, right.
Right.
How am I gonna leave?
Why, why are
you laughing? We can go.
- Martine's gone.
-  No, Ali
can watch the baby.
With the break in, and all
the weird stuff going on,
I just don't want
to leave him alone.
You know, we can't just
let this affect us that much.
If we do that,
the terrorists win.
-
-  Right?
I miss you, you know?
I miss my wife, the fun wife.
And I know I've been kind
of a tool. And I just wanna...
All right, so all the emergency
numbers are in this cabinet.
Yep.
But now his new doctor
is in there.
- Mm-hm.
-  Also his allergist.
- Mm-hm.
-  And remember,
- no peanuts on anything. Um...
- I know, no peanuts.
-
- Make sure the doors
and the windows
are locked, OK?
Upstairs, in the back,
out front, every...
- Go!
- I love you.
- Have a great time with him.
- Bye.
- Mm, I love you!
- Bye. Have a good time.
-
- Take the money.
- Coming!
- Bye! Say, "Bye, Mama!"
Bye. Bye!
Don't get too wasted!
Bye! Can you
say bye-bye?
Jesus Christ.
-  What the...?
- Hello?
- Did I scare you?
- Yes.
- Lightly. Have to
warm up the board.
- Mm-hm.
You have to
warm up the board?
If a spirit's present,
will you give us a sign?
Like, literally, anything.
- Literally...
- Yeah, no, there's...
-  OK.
-
What do you want?
- Brad.  Brad.
- I'm not moving it.
It's not me.
"P"...
..."U"...
- Ali, are you doing this?
- No, I'm fucking not.
..."S"...
..."S"...
-  What the fuck?
- Wait, it's still going.
It goes to the "Y."
Oh, it spells "pussy."
I mean, what, what...
Hey, hey, hey.
Pussy?!
Maybe the spirit...
spirits want some pussy.
- Spirits?
- Yes, the spirits
might be horny
- at the moment.
- Shh!
- You never know. I know I am.
- Pussy.
You know what?
We should keep going.
- Wait, do you feel that?
- Yes, 'cause you're moving it.
No, I'm not moving it.
No, this time
I'm really not moving it.
- It's...
- Wait. "H"...
Pussy-ehh.
No, Ali, I'm really, I'm really
not moving it this time.
- I promise you.
-
No, what the fuck?
Are you doing this?
No.
"N"...
- ..."T"...
- "Pussy Hunt."
It's like the worst
game of Ouija ever.
Did you spell that? Are
you trying to tell me something?
Yeah, yeah,
I spelled "pussy hunt."
Would you like me
to go on a pussy hunt?
I can do that
for you right now.

Brad?
-
- Come on.
-
-  Oh, shit.
-
-  Shit.
-
-
-
- Hi.
Ali?
-
- Oh.
Oh, there you go,
that's better, right?
Ali?
Is Ali upstairs?
- No, she isn't up here.
- She's not upstairs?
Ali? Ali!
Dad? Dad? Kristi?
- Where have you been?!
-  Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God, I am so sorry.
- What happened?
I'm so sorry.
I got locked out.
Why would you even answer the
door to somebody just knocking?
- Just open the door?
- No, I thought...
Did you look outside
to see who it was?
Yes! Yes, I couldn't.
But that's the thing, see.
I couldn't see anybody, and I
thought that Brad was out there.
But if you don't see anybody,
then you don't go outside!
Your little brother
was upstairs by himself.
- I know. I was freaking out.
- Right?
I know.
I didn't, I've never,
I swear to God, I never
would have done that.
- I don't understand.
What happened?
- It wasn't an accident
because something slammed
the door behind me.
We were worried
sick about...
What do you mean?
Wait, Daniel...
I took a nap, and I heard
somebody calling my name.
- What?
- I felt something,
like somebody
was calling my name,
and I felt somebody there.
Are you sure
you weren't dreaming?
You weren't there.
You didn't feel it.
- The wind blew the door closed.
- There wasn't any wind.
All right? I don't want
to hear any more of this
haunted house crap!
OK? That's enough. You guys
are driving me crazy.
End of story.
It was like you said,
with the pots falling.
- You know what?
- I was taking a nap,
- and something
was calling my name.
- Sweetheart...
I'm just gonna go
calm him down, OK?
Just go upstairs
and try to go to bed, OK?
OK, buddy.
There you go. No, no, no.
You're eating breakfast now.
You want it
on here instead?
OK.
Morning.
Good morning.
Nice.
Mm. Whoo.
Bye, little buddy.
Hot, hot, hot.
OK, Hunter. Got to eat.
Got to eat.
Come on, buddy.
I don't get it.
How can you not want a back rub?
Because I'm concentrating.
-  But you
know you love it.
- Stop.
But this site says that if it's,
like, really persistent,
which it is, obviously,
at this point, that it's
probably not a ghost.
It's probably something else.
And it's possibly a demon.
Well, what's the
difference between
a demon and a ghost?
Um, because ghosts
are dead people,
so they're, like, human energy.
And demons are not human.
They're just...
...like, evil.
Psyching yourself out,
looking online there.
I'm not psyching myself out.
Remember
when I told you that my mom
thought she had that, like,
that flesh-eating disease?
She freaked herself out.
It's kinda like that, you know?
- Oh, my God. Babe, here.
-  Let me see it.
-  Like fourth
paragraph down.
-
"It has been said that
if a human makes a bargain
with a demon for wealth,
power, or any other benefit,
they must forfeit
their firstborn male.
If the debt is not honored,
the demon will follow the..."
Why are you smiling?
It's not funny.
"...will follow the defaulter
and his or her brood
until its soul
of an infant is collected."
So?
OK, so this is
the freakiest thing ever.
It happened to me last night.
This is the door...
...closing by itself.
That's me walking outside.
Yeah. Dad!
Will you come in here, please?!
OK, please stand over here
and watch this.
Jesus.
Don't look at me,
look at the screen.
Yeah. The wind blows
the door closed.
-  Dad.
- Thank you.
Are you serious?
- It's happened
to me a million times.
-  There's no wind!
The wind comes from the back
when the windows are open.
It's inside the house
and nothing else is open!
Turn it off and stop
messing with the system.
Dad, there's obviously
something in the house!
Please, come on.
It's the same thing
Martine's been saying.
Come get your dinner.
It's getting cold.
I think
I just heard something
coming from downstairs.
-
-  Fuck! Fuck,
fuck, fuck, fuck.
Oh, Jesus Christ. Fuck.
-
-  Shit!
It woke me up.
Like, it sounded like
the door or something.
So I kind of checked it out
and Dad was snoring.
And... I caught it on here.
Do you want to see?
- Right there, you see?
- That's weird.
It's definitely weird.
It just freaks me out because
it just reminds me of like...
...what Martine was saying
about the house.
What did she say
about the house?
She said that there were
bad spirits in the house
that she had to clear out. She
was clearing out the bad spirits
and letting in the good spirits.
But something like that...
I don't have any other
explanation for. Do you?
I don't. I...
I remember being
scared all the time.
What do you mean "scared
all the time," though?
- I don't know.
- No, but what do you mean?
- Like you felt,
you felt scared...
- I don't remember.
I mean, I've been...
I'm scared.
So what, did she,
like, lock herself out?
Well, she said the
door slammed shut on its own.
-  No.
-  Oh, yeah.
That's pretty
darn creepy.
-
-  Yeah.
Listen, this is
gonna sound totally crazy,
and I know that, but...
I've been having this
feeling lately that,
that maybe whatever happened
to us when we were little...
I think it's starting again.
I don't want to talk
about this, Kristi.
I don't remember
anything.
I just remember being
scared all the time. What...
You want to know what
I remember? I remember
you crying all the time.
I remember you couldn't sleep,
and you got anxiety attacks.
I remember that you
stopped talking for months.
I remember weird people
came to our house
and our mom was upset all the
time. That's what I remember.
Whatever it was,
it thrived on fear.
The more we paid attention
to it, the worse it got.
You need to leave this alone.
You need to ignore it, or you're
gonna end up just like Mom.
Do you understand me?
Do you understand me?
Yeah, OK. I will.
Wanna go for a walk?
Hm? Abby.
Come on.
-
- Oh, God!
God! Leave me alone!
Yo, Kris?
- Uh-huh.
-  Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
-  Did something
just happen?
...completely fine.
Everything is fine.
Look at me.
Kristi.
Honey, everything is fine.
It's obviously
not. Look at...
Your Aunt Katie
said that we can't talk about
these things, OK?
Because if you do,
it just goes... worse.
- Listen.
-  What do you mean?
Everything's fine. Ali, just
stop. Everything's fine.
OK.
No, but listen to me. That other
website said that some people...
...like, make deals with demons
for wealth and power.
So what if, what if
Kristi's great grandmother
made a deal with a demon
so she could get rich?
I went through the entire,
I went through
the entire family line.
And Hunter is the first male
to be born on Kristi's side
since, at least, the 1930s.
Don't tell me that shit
isn't coincidence.
Lie down.
Shh. Good girl.
-
-
- Dad?
-  Yeah.
Did you hear that?
I heard something.
What the fuck?
Oh, God, it's Abby. Abby? Abby.
- What's the matter, baby?
-  Oh, my God.
-  Oh, God.
-  Is she OK?
Yeah. No, no, no.
Honey, grab my keys and stuff?
-  Grab my shoes!
-  What's going on?
I don't know. There's
something wrong with Abby.
-  Dad, I'm going with you!
- She's still breathing.
- What can I do?
What should I do?
- Stay here with Hunter.
OK.
I'll call you
when we get there.
- OK.
-  Oh, my God.
Just call me back
when you get this.
Let me know if she's OK.
OK, love you.
Hey, um...
Is she gonna be OK?
I love you. Bye.
Oh, God, please!
Let go of me!
No, don't! Hunter!
Please!
Please! Ah!
No, I don't know.
They thought it was a seizure.
No, she's never
had one before, ever.
- And she was making this noise.
- Ali?
Babe, I got to call you
right back, OK?
Honey, I'm really sorry
to do this to you.
I know this is
really bad timing.
There's something wrong
with Kristi, OK?
- I can't get her out of bed.
- What's wrong with her?
...guys from Portland. I've been
putting them off for weeks.
- I can't blow them off.
- OK, please, listen to me.
Can I just take Hunter
to Brad's?
No, I need you
to stay here.
I'll come home when
you come home.
Honey, I know this sucks.
I do, I know, OK?
I know you're freaked
out and I'm really sorry.
I'll be there for like
two hours, all right?
And I have to
pick up Abby. OK?
Please? I'm sorry, OK?
I... call me. I'll be, like,
two hours. If anything's wrong,
just call me and
I'll be right here,
- OK?
-  OK.
I just cannot
miss this today.
- Thank you. OK?
-  OK, bye.
All right, don't worry.
Lock the door behind me, OK?
Yeah, I mean,
obviously.
No, I put him down.
He's sleeping.
She's not here.
She's still at the vet's.
No, 'cause they have
to run tests
'cause they don't
know what it was.
Brad, it was...
like fucking...
I've never heard her
cry like that.
Or just tell them that you want
to come over for an hour.
Please?
Please. No, I just don't
want to be here alone.
Yeah, well, basically.
She's sick or something.
OK. OK, bye.
Love you, too. Bye.
Oh, my God.
OK, so, just found this
on the basement door.
Um... I don't really know
where it came from.
I think that that's blood,
but I can't really tell.
This comes up pretty high.
I don't think she could
get up there.
It kind of looks like letters,
but I don't really know
what it means.
What the fuck is that?
-
-
Kristi?
Kristi?
Hey, sweetpea.
What's going on?
Come here, sweetie.
Oh, yeah.
Dad?
You have to come home
right now.
Dad, you have
to come home.
Something is really wrong
with Kristi. Please!
Please, come home,
please.
Please, just, please, come home.
Please. Please.
Kristi?
Kristi? Hunter's crying.
Don't touch him!
What the fuck?
What the fuck?
- Are you OK?
-  No!
- Oh, my. Where is she?
-  She's upstairs.
She's in Hunter's room.
You can't go up there!
- I have to see if she's OK.
- You can't go up there!
You have to look
at the tape!
- I have to check on Hunter.
- She got attacked!
You have to watch
the tape! Please!
Please, please,
just listen to me!
Dad, we have to go
right now.
Fuck. Dad? Dad, look at me.
Do you believe me now?
Come on! We can't stay here!
Please!
-
- Dad!
What are you doing?
She tried to warn me,
and I wouldn't listen.
Wait,
who are you talking about?
-
- Dad, who are you
talking about?
-
- What?
Olive oil?
- What?
-
- What am I gonna do with this?
-
- This is gonna knock her out?
-S?.
I told you to stay here.
OK, you're kind of freaking
me out right now, OK?
Can you please talk to me?
Dad, look at her leg.
Look at the bite.
What the fuck?!
No, no. No way, no way.
We can't do this to her.
It's her family.
- Please, please...
- What am I supposed to do?!
It's Kristi's fucking sister!
We can't do that to her!
We can't do this.
We cannot do this to her.
Look, there is no other way.
Yes, there is. We can transfer
it to somebody else.
- No, we can't. No, we can't.
- That's what we have to do.
OK? Martine said it had
to be a blood relative.
OK? That's my wife
and my son!
- That is your
little baby brother!
- Do we tell her?
- Do we tell her what happened?
- No, we never tell anyone.
She's not even gonna
remember, OK?
Martine said she's not
gonna remember, OK?
And we're not gonna
talk about it, ever!
And I don't care if you
agree with me or not, OK?
It's my decision!
I'm doing it!
What...?
Let's go, please.
Please, Dad.
Dad?
Dad, please, please, be careful.
Please.
Kristi?
Kristi?
-
-  Dad!
Dad! I can't see anything!
Dad?!
-  Ali, where are you?
-  I'm right here!
-  Where are you?!
-  I'm right here!
I'm right here!
- Here, here, take it.
- Fuck.
-
-
Fuck!
Where's the...
-
-  Where's the baby?!
-
-
- I don't know!
-
Dad, let's get out of
here! Come on!
OK, OK.
-
-
-
-
Stay right there, OK?
Just stay there.
-  No! No, no!
-  Stay there!
Just stay behind me, OK?
Just stay right there!
OK. OK.
What's happening?!
Oh, my God.
-
-
-  Ali!
-
-
-  Oh, my God!
-  They're in the basement.
-  Are you OK?
-  Dad?
- Just, just stay there! OK.
Dad. Dad.
-  Just stay here. OK?
- OK.
-  Hunter!
-
Oh, Jesus.
I can't see anything.
What the fuck?
-
- Jesus! Fuck!
- Oh! Fuck!
-
Hunter!
Damn it.
I almost gotcha. Almost gotcha.
OK, I got you. Oh, God.
I got you, little buddy.
Are you OK?
OK, you stay there.
All right. Are you ready?
You're gonna like this.
I am ready,
I'm thrilled. I'm excited.
Is it a tie? Is it...?
Oh! Shocking!
So how are things, uh... here?
Is there any more weird stuff
- going on or, you know?
-  No.
- No?
-  Everything's great.
Good. I must be losing
my mind. I just...
I feel like there's stuff
going on at our house,
to the point where I actually
told Micah about it,
and I'm sure he thinks
I'm crazy.
You should
take your own advice.
We shouldn't talk about this
stuff. It just drives us nuts.
- You're right.
-  Sis?
Goodbye, Hunter!
- I love you, little fella!
-  Bye, Auntie!
- Bye, sis. See you soon.
- All right.
What is that?
Hello, baby.
Hi.
Is that what I think it is?
Yeah, it's... I don't
know what you think it is,
but whatever it is,
it's pretty sweet.
I think it's a giant-ass camera.
What happened to, like,
the little handheld?
Easy to move around, versatile.
Are you gonna park the car
or are you gonna stand there,
looking at me?
This is, uh...
big and impressive,
and it has a really
bright light on it.
-  Kiss the camera,
will you?
- I'm not kissing the camera.
-  Come on.
- How much did this cost you?
-  What?
- How much did...
I'll kiss you, but I'm
not gonna kiss the camera.
