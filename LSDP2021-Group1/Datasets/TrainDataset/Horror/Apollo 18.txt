There's just a lot
at stake here, you know?
We're talkin' nation
versus nation,
There's lots to discover
out there, man.
I guess the call came in
on a Friday.
Nate and I were
at Ben's for a barbecue.
Um... Just a few beers,
you know, maybe more than a few.
With Ben's cooking,
you definitely need a few.
Nate took the call.
It was Milton,
and Milton said
but it was classified,
DOD, top secret.
Asked, you know,
"Are you OK with that?"
And he was like,
"Are you kidding me?"
I come from a family
of military pilots.
Duty can sometimes
outbalance a private life.
Make choices,
keep moving forward.
NASA already has something
like 800 pounds of rocks.
So why we need more, I don't know, but,
hey, if it means a trip to the moon...
Placing cameras. We got these
Westinghouses all over the place.
Well, I think the way it's being
explained is they're using
a Saturn V to launch
a classified DOD payload, uh,
which is meant to be very large,
very heavy, and, uh...
...apparently unmanned.
-
Apparently.
Placing these
high-frequency transmitters.
Part of some early warning
antimissile defense system
These PSD5s are kind of like
high-tech radar scanners,
they should pick up and track
anything we can't.
Gotta keep a little eye
on the Russians, there.
Would've been nice
to tell my wife.
Laura had been by my side
the whole time, and, uh...
...she thinks I'm off doing a training
exercise with the Japanese space agency.
Ryan, my boy, would've been nice to tell
him his old man's goin' to the moon.
I would've loved to have
brought him a souvenir.
Maybe a moon rock.
I don't know. Maybe one day.
Yeah, I'll admit, I'm a little jealous
that he'll be moon-walkin' with Nate
while I'll be all by my
lonesome, piloting the orbiter.
My job is, essentially, to make
sure I bring us home safely.
Look, let's face it, these
missions are result-oriented,
and, uh, we can't afford
to fail here, now can we?
Things can go wrong,
things do go wrong, it happens,
but you just gotta push
that out of your mind.
It's just not an option.
I'm proud to do it
for these guys.
And I'm proud to do it
for my country.
T-minus
ten, nine, eight, seven,
- six, five, four, three...
-
Apollo 18, you're looking good.
-  Christmas lights.
-
- Bring any Christmas lights, Ben?
- Nope, not me.
You ever see anything
like that before?
No, sir.
It's amazing.
Earth in all her glory.
That's a good-lookin' boy.
You sure he's yours?
Watch it. He's a good kid.
He's got big shoes to fill now.
- Big ol' moon boots.
-
So, Nate, you wait all this time
to put your foot on the moon,
and you get to be number 13.
How you feel about that?
You gonna be OK
with staying behind, John?
Oh, you know, it'd be nice
to have some alone time.
It's gettin' crowded in here.
I'll keep a light on for you,
boys. Don't stay out too late now.
See you in
a couple of days, partner.
Roger that.
See you in a couple days.
Houston, this is Freedom
preparing to undock Liberty. Over.
OK, 18, you're
go for undock in four minutes.
OK, Liberty,
we're ready to send you
Roger, Houston. We're pooling
data. Computer is all yours.
Wish you were
comin' with us, John.
Now, you boys
be careful down there.
We're go for the moon!
Seven hundred feet.
Down 20. Looking good.
Mission Elapsed Time: four days,
six hours, 33 minutes.
-  Gonna have to land long.
-  Where?
Over that next crater.
Twelve o'clock.
Next to the rim.
It's a pretty rocky area. Mark it.
Four hundred and 30 feet.
Down 15, 25 forward.
-
-  Houston, we have
You are go
on the twelve-oh-one, Liberty.
Liberty,
position vector mark one-eight.
You wanna think
about revisiting that approach?
Negative, we'll miss our window.
Those boulders are some big mothers.
Sub boosters
on my three, two, one, mark.
-  Liberty status?
- We're comin' in too fast.
Liberty to Houston,
range is long. Going manual.
- Contact light.
-  Standby for T1 stay/no stay.
- Engine arm off.
-  Stay for T1, Liberty.
Houston,
you give that man a cigar.
From up here,
that looked very pretty.
Excellent touchdown.
Oh, are you talkin' to me or Nate?
Well, I'm talking
to you both, Ben.
December 25th, 1974.
MET: four days, nine hours,
Commander Nathan Walker.
DOD Mission Report One-A.
We're day one of our two-day mission.
Prepping for EVA-One and payload setup.
This is Thomas Young
at Apollo Mission Control.
In addition to the Mauer
- this mission will mark...
- Looks like five reels,
- 10,000 feet Kodachrome.
-  The RCA module
data acquisition cameras
inside the lunar module
Houston, we are
prepped for EVA-One.
Copy, Liberty.
You are go for cabin depress.
Button up good, boys. We don't
want anyone catching cold.
Can you check me over?
It'd help if you
were a little smaller.
- Check my PLSS.
- Yup.
Houston...
...we're taking our first steps
on the south pole.
I prepared a speech, but no one
but us would hear it anyway.
No words can describe
how it feels to be here.
Rock formations everywhere.
The sun is low, on the horizon.
it's amazing.
Freedom, do you read?
Freedom reads you loud
and clear, Liberty. Over.
Yeah, yeah. Perfect.
You call that a salute?
OK, let me get a shot of you
with the LM in the background.
That looks like a Navy salute to me.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
I gotta get this.
Promised Laura and Ryan
I'd spend Christmas with them.
This is all goin' back
to the Department of Defense.
No one's ever gonna...
Completing Westinghouse setup.
Sounds good, Nate.
Standing by.
Motion sensor is tracking
you perfectly, Nate.
Captain Video says first round
is on him when you get back.
I'm checking
the payload in the MESA unit.
-
-
-  Shit!
-
What was that?
Houston, can you track
that power flux?
I'd like to get a fix
on the interference.
Roger, Nate. Looks like you're
ready to proceed to location one
- and initiate setup procedures.
- Copy. We're on our way.
Will you take a look at that?
It makes you think, doesn't it?
Damn, it's dusty.
I'm leaving the camera up here
so you can get a better view, Tommy.
And for your information,
we're about three hours
and 20 minutes...
it's hard to believe the sun never
shines in some of these places. Ever.
Careful, now, fellas.
You drop into any of those craters,
PSD5 in place.
Roger.
Proceed with startup.
Did you record the signal
frequency on the PSD5 during training?
-  It was ALSEP, wasn't it?
-  Thought it was.
I think they changed it.
Set astral coordinates,
four-eight-point-three on the Z
and eight-niner-point-eight
on... Record.
-  Initiation sequence complete.
-
-
-
Houston, we're getting some noise
on the high-gain again.
Collecting geological samples near
what appears to be a... impact crater.
The sample feels...
...strange.
it's great
to get out of that gear.
MET: four days,
Commander Nathan Walker.
DOD Mission Report Three-Charlie.
Day one, EVA-One complete.
I am starving.
What's on the menu tonight?
Carrots or peas?
I'll take carrots.
- No. You get the peas.
- Perfect.
I'm mighty proud of you, boys.
- You have a good time out there?
-  You know it.
I'm gettin' a lot of noise
on this frequency.
I'm gonna see if I can isolate it,
maybe clean it up a bit.
Astronaut Ryan Anderson
with his dad, flying through space.
-
-
-  Ryan, what are you doing?
-  Just playing, Mom.
Don't play
with your dad's stuff
Beverly's in a panic because
a hair appointment ran over.
Stan and Jean are already over
and nothing's ready,
so I offer to help cut
all these jalapenos.
Couple of minutes later,
I'm in the bathroom takin' a leak
with all this jalapeno nonsense
on my hands.
Next thing I know,
my crotch is on fire.
So I'm in the bathroom,
hollering in pain.
-  And they can hear you?
- Oh, oh, they heard me.
And Stan's wife's a nurse,
so she sends me back into the bathroom
- with a cup of milk.
- Nate, I gotta stop you.
You're not about to tell me that you
dipped your balls in a glass of milk?
- Hey, don't knock it. It works.
-  Jalapeno dick.
I can't believe you
haven't heard that story.
-  Is Beverly back in Miami?
-  Yeah. So I hear.
You realize she divorced
you because you snore, right?
- I don't snore.
- Yeah.
Every time.
- You all right, Benny?
- Yeah, I'm good.
- You bang your head?
- Again.
It's a big head.
Thanks for the housekeeping,
guys. Great first day.
We'll miss you over at Marybelle's.
Get some sleep.
Good night, JD.
Never should have
told you that. You little prick.
- Nate?
- Yeah, I hear it.
What can that be here?
Give me a second.
- It should be on comm?
-
- What's that?
-
Right.
- You hear that?
- Yeah.
All right. Uh...
Sounds like it's
coming from up here.
- That doesn't sound right.
-
Tommy, you think this interference could
be coming from the PSD5 setup?
We don't see anything obvious.
We'll double-check with DOD.
We'll look into it.
Go get some sleep.
-
-
I'm up! You can turn off the noise.
We took care of the interference
a couple hours ago.
You guys should be OK.
Let's get ready for EVA-Two, OK?
-
-
MET: five days,
eight hours, 34 minutes.
IMP Ben Anderson.
I gotta document this.
-
- Now, Nate...
Nate says he never snores in his sleep.
Now I got proof.
- Ha!
-
Well, boys, I just wanna let
you know that Freedom will be going
- No comm for a while.
-  Roger that.
Hey, I made you breakfast.
What do I got today?
- Scrambled eggs.
- Oh, again. What do you got?
I'm going with
the delicious ham spread.
- Hm.
- It's all yours.
- Just like Mom makes.
-
Hey, did you remove
one of my samples?
Huh?
Look, one of my samples
is on the floor.
-
- What's that doing there, Ben?
I don't know.
I bagged and tagged everything.
- Look, uh...
- It's gotta go back in.
Yeah, grab me the scoop.
I'm going to have to mark
this one contaminated.
I don't understand.
How did it get there?
- I don't know.
- No, really, Ben, how'd that get there?
I don't know.
DOD is checking
on the interference
- Run a diagnostic...
-
Houston? Do you copy?
I think we lost them.
Probably got
some comm blockage.
These are some big craters.
Five days, ten hours,
Commander Nathan Walker.
We're on EVA-Two.
Initiating day two receiver setup.
Activating PSD5 transmission signal.
Houston, do you copy?
This is Liberty, over.
Still down.
There is something
with that frequency.
Comm shouldn't be cuttin' out
like that, not for this length of time.
Where are you goin'?
What the hell?
- Nate.
-  What is it?
Tracks.
What?
No, that's impossible.
These aren't ours.
MET: five days,
IMP Anderson.
- Tracks appear in single...
-
Houston, this is 18.
Do you copy?
Houston, this is 18. Do you read?
John's on the backside.
No comm from him, either.
Well, let's see where they lead.
Impact crater.
You feel that?
Yeah. Temperature dropped.
Look at the footprints.
It doesn't make sense.
I think he was
just walking in circles.
Disoriented.
-  Oxygen dep?
-  I don't know.
They go off in this direction.
Get up here!
Holy shit.
it's Russian.
What the hell?
How could there be Russians
on the moon and nobody knows about it?
We're on the moon
and nobody knows about us.
Something's not right.
I'm gonna look inside.
Lights are off.
Somebody lost it in here.
This place is trashed.
Their systems aren't
that different from ours.
Powers up.
Oxygen reserves are good.
Can't tell if she's
fully operational, though.
-  Where the hell did they go?
-  I don't know.
I'm gonna take a look around.
But stay close.
Those Russians could be anywhere.
What the hell?
There's blood. A lot of it.
Somebody got hurt pretty bad.
I don't like this.
I think I see something
inside the crater.
I'm goin' down.
Wait, Ben. The suits
aren't ready for that kind of cold.
It's OK,
the crater isn't so deep.
-
-  it's so cold.
I just see rocks.
The ground, it's, uh...
it's different.
It feels... softer.
Get out of there.
Oh, God...
So cold.
-  Get out of there! Ben!
-
OK, yeah, all right.
I'm headin' back up.
I found him!
I got the cosmonaut!
it's OK. I'm all right.
I'm on my way up!
-  You all right?
- Yeah, I'm warmin' up.
Oh, Christ.
What the hell happened here?
Maybe the other cosmonaut?
You think he killed him?
There's a rip.
What are you doing?
Get your hand out of there.
Wait a minute,
there's something...
Get away from him!
What the hell was that?
It was a rock.
Must have happened
when I was dragging him out.
- I don't know.
-  Let's get out of here.
All right, we're almost
at the point of no return, Ben.
If we don't go now,
we'll end up just as dead.
I don't like this.
Someone died up here...
Enough.
This is a secure line.
I'm just talking to you, right,
Tommy?
The Russians have been to the moon.
The Russians have landed
on the south pole.
We found their LK Proton Lander,
but it didn't end well
for the cosmonaut.
- You find a crash site?
- They didn't crash.
We found his body in a crater.
You tellin' me you didn't know this?
We land less than two clicks
from a Soviet LK,
and you expect me to believe
you didn't know they were here?
You know they scrubbed their
manned flight program in'69,
Did you know they were here?
- Tommy?
- This is a DOD mission, Nate.
I'm just briefed in on what I need
to know. That's all I can tell you.
You get that little prick
from DOD to give me a call.
Get some rest. I'll get the DOD
over here and we'll talk to you soon.
-  Tommy's a straight shooter.
- No.
I knew something was wrong
from the beginning.
All right, what are you thinking?
DOD takin' over,
lyin' to our families.
Then they're rushing us
up here for what?
What, to set up
some listening devices?
Yeah. Makes no sense.
Come on, think about Watergate, Nate.
I mean, that was our president,
for Christ sakes, and you don't think
that DOD would just lie to us?
So, what are we
doing up here then?
What are we really doing?
Well,
it's kind of spooky, really.
Strange beauty on the backside.
I don't know if it's my
mind playin' tricks on me,
but every so often you look
out these little windows and...
...get this sense that something
might be lookin' back...
...back at you.
-
-
Nate, look at this.
- What?
- Look at this!
The flag's gone.
No, this isn't right.
Houston, this is 18, over.
Houston, Liberty.
Did you see anything unusual
on the Westinghouse last night?
Uh... We got some
interference and dropouts.
Our flag is gone.
Maybe the other cosmonaut took it.
If there was another cosmonaut,
he'd be away from his LK for, what,
-  What are you thinkin', John?
-  There's no way.
So how could he survive?
You saying the Soviets
flew a one-man mission?
If there's one cosmonaut,
who took the flag?
Who killed the other cosmonaut
that we found?
We need to get
DOD on the line. Now.
We suspected the Soviets might
be there, but we had no confirmation.
Intelligence warned that they
might be disguising missions
- as routine satellite launches.
- Why the hell didn't you tell us?
National security. We play our cards
pretty close to the vest, Commander.
Maybe a little too close.
We were concerned they might get
their eye in the sky up there first.
It would be
a national security disaster.
So where the hell's
this other cosmonaut?
What, they're just
gonna leave him here?
Our intelligence suggests
there was only one cosmonaut.
- Goddamn!
- Setup's complete.
It's time to get
you boys home again.
So that's it?
Let's focus on getting home.
We'll ask questions later.
- Seven-seven-six-two.
-  Your RCS feed is looking good.
-
-
What the hell was that?
Let's get outta here.
Ten seconds.
- Ten seconds. Ready on my mark.
-  Ten, nine...
- Time to go home.
- ...eight, seven, six...
-
- Master alarm!
Shit! We are no go!
We are no go!
- Safe this damn thing.
- I'm trying!
- I've got a major power glitch.
- We're losing the descent oxygen.
- We got a leak somewhere!
- I'm gonna try and isolate the tanks
and see if I can stop it.
Houston, do you copy?
- Repeat, Houston, do you copy?
- Engine arm off!
We've lost comm.
Prop valves, closed.
- No, no, no, no, no, no...
- What the hell is going on?
No. Houston, this is Liberty. Over.
We just lost communications.
- How the hell did that happen?
- I don't know.
Impact on the LM, maybe a meteorite?
There's no way to tell
without going EVA.
- Give me a hand with the PLSS.
- You sure about this?
We need comm to get home.
Can't just stay in here and wait.
- Look, I can play with the omni...
- Suit up!
Leaving egress platform.
Stepping down the ladder.
MET: six days...
...13 hours, 46 minutes.
Commander Walker is performing
an unscheduled EVA
to repair the S-Band antenna
on the Rover.
We've experienced...
We've experienced some
unexplained, uh... malfunctions.
Looks like the hull's
insulation is damaged.
Could be debris from the impact,
but I don't see any meteor residue.
- This is ripped to pieces.
-  Something hit us?
I can't tell.
We get that same feedback
each time we use active comm.
Sounds like crossover
chatter from another frequency.
I can't squelch it.
I've never heard anything like it.
-
-  Wait, wait.
Nate, talk to me.
What do you see?
Looks like tracks.
Footprints? Maybe there
is another cosmonaut.
No.
MET: six days,
Commander Nathan Walker.
We're witnessing
what could be evidence...
...of extraterrestrial contact.
We're witnessing
what could be evidence
of extraterrestrial contact.
Do you know what you're saying?
These tracks are not human.
I found the flag.
It's shredded.
And the motion-sensor camera is gone.
S-Band looks OK, just got knocked.
I'm turning the Rover back up.
Connection looks good.
Try to reach Houston or Freedom.
Freedom, copy.
- Houston, do you copy?
-
Damn it. No, look, it's not working.
All right, let me try something.
Wait. Something's...
Something's moving. Something's moving.
What? I don't see anything.
Something in... inside my suit!
It's in my helmet!
Nate, listen to me.
Get back to the LM!
-  I can't get it out!
- Nate, come back to the LM, OK? Nate?
- I can't get it out!
- There's nothing inside your suit.
- Now, get back to the ship!
-  it's in my helmet!
- I can't take it out!
- Nate!
Oh, Christ.
Nate!
Nate!
-
-  Nate! You need oxygen!
Come on, Nate!
You got to keep moving!
Come on, we're almost there.
- Come on, Nate. Keep moving.
-
You're almost there. Come on.
Come on. We're almost there.
Come on. Pull yourself in.
Cabin's locked!
Cabin repress auto, point-five PSI.
Look, you're not getting enough oxygen.
- Hang on. Breathe!
-
Breathe! PSI one.
Look at me. You're gonna be all right.
Breathe. One-point-five.
Two.
Two-point-five.
Three! Cabin pressure is stable.
It's OK. You're gonna be OK!
So... you OK?
I'm fine.
What happened out there?
You started screamin', I come
out there, you're on your back.
Liberty, this is Freedom.
Do you read me? Over.
Liberty this is Freedom.
Do you read? Over
Uh, Houston, this is Freedom.
Do you read me? Over.
-  We read you, John. Over.
- I can't raise Liberty, Tommy.
Copy that, Freedom.
We're having the same issues down here.
Well, we've got some
sort of interference.
Could have something
to do with those PSD5s.
Yeah, we've been assured the PSD5s
aren't the source of the problem.
All right, well, why don't we
try to shut down the receivers
- and see what happens?
- Uh, negative.
Well, why not? We got two men
down there, Tommy. Come on.
Tommy?
Tommy, you there?
We're working on the problem, John.
We'll keep you advised.
Oh, you're working on it.
That's great. Great.
Goddamn it.
Liberty, this is Freedom.
Do you copy?
MET: six days, 16 hours, 12 minutes.
Post-EVA interview
one-alpha with Commander Walker.
I already told you
everything I remember.
Come on.
I was repairing the S-Band.
I thought I saw something...
I thought I saw something
out of the corner of my eye.
I was wrong.
Then there was a shrieking noise.
It caught me off guard. Slipped.
Must have hit a rock.
That's it.
You said something was
inside your helmet. You yelled it.
I don't remember that.
Christ, Nate, you're bleeding.
Look at your shirt. You're bleeding.
- Jesus Christ!
- Hand me the first aid kit.
You said something
was inside your suit, Nate.
The inside, you said.
You said inside your helmet.
I don't get it.
How'd you get that wound?
Now, if there was something in your
suit, then where the hell did it go?
Wait a second.
Nate... Look, I can feel it right...
right here.
Oh, man, there's something inside.
-  What are you talkin' about?
- Right here, look.
- It's hard, under the skin.
- Jesus.
I need to get that out, OK?
Yeah, OK, just make it quick.
Just...
It'll be all right. Hang in there.
- OK.
-
Jesus, it's really in there.
It's like it's moving.
- Get it out. Get it out!
- I got it. I got it. it's coming!
- Damn it, Ben! Get it out!
-
-
- Hey, are you all right? You all right?
Hang on. Hang on.
Hang on.
Put something on it.
It looks like one of my samples.
You said you felt something
moving in your helmet.
I don't understand.
How the hell did this get in...?
-
-
Goddamn it, you contaminated
the entire ship!
Houston, we read you.
Yes, damn it!
Houston, we read you!
They can't hear us.
Those PSD5s...
What if they're not there
for spying on the Russians?
What do you mean?
Look, they told us
that the transmitters
would pick up an ALSEP frequency,
but they don't.
They're blocking our comm.
They're emitting a signal.
All right.
But why would they be doing that?
No, keep filming. Keep filming.
You need to document this.
To attract the things that made
the tracks that you saw.
Whatever killed the cosmonaut.
All these cameras, Ben...
...they're watching it.
We're on our own.
We're guinea pigs.
That's why they sent us up here.
We gotta dismantle those transmitters.
PSD5's destroyed.
There's debris everywhere.
Look at these tracks.
Nate, they were here.
Let's check on the other sites.
Liberty, this is Houston.
Do you copy?
Something's out here.
It's gone.
-
- Nate, we're too late.
This was a bad idea.
You need to get your rest, Nate, OK?
We're gonna get you back to the LM.
Oh, Jesus Christ, Nate.
It's entered your bloodstream.
Previous wound seems to...
have become infected.
Eyes appear extremely bloodshot.
I don't know how to treat this.
Houston, this is Freedom. I haven't
been able to reach Nate or Ben.
Comm is still down
with Liberty.
We have no communication with the crew,
but we are receiving data from the LM.
We're trying to restore comm now.
Stand by, Freedom.
Looks like you can hear us,
but we can't hear you.
We've lost the Westinghouse and your
vitals, but we're still getting LM data.
We estimate 12 hours left
on your LM life support,
and the troops are sortin'
out the engine problems.
We're doin' everything we can.
We're gonna get you home.
-
-  We're gonna get you home.
They're lying.
No.
No, they'll get us back.
They have to get us back.
They want that footage.
- What about the Russian ship?
- That poor Russian bastard.
He was infected, just like me.
I'm getting worse.
Ben.
- You gotta leave me here.
- No.
- No one's leaving anyone.
- You'll have to.
We are not dying up here.
Fate has ordained...
...the men who went to the moon
to explore in peace...
...remain on the moon
to rest in peace.
What the hell
are you talking about?
I feel my thoughts...
...fragmenting.
Like I'm being drawn to them.
I'm so tired, Ben.
MET: six days, 22 hours, 23 minutes.
IMP Anderson. Delta reel.
No further communication
from Houston.
Oxygen levels are running low.
Nate's been asleep for about an hour.
The sickness seems
to have brought on fatigue.
We're not gonna make it here.
If Houston doesn't come up with a plan
in the next couple of hours,
we'll, uh...
We'll abandon Liberty,
head towards the Russian LK.
Their comm and oxygen
are our only hope.
I just pray to God...
Jesus Christ!
Oh, Jesus.
Partial laceration, upper left rib.
The infection's spreading.
Oh, goddamn it.
Must've been the same thing
that happened to the Russian.
- The rock... Christ, Nate!
- I'm not gonna let you kill me.
Nate, it's me. Listen to me.
Look at me. it's me, OK?
I'm just trying to help you.
You're gettin' worse.
Don't ever touch me.
-
- Nate! Geez!
What the hell are you doing?
- They're everywhere!
- Please, Nate, you'll kill us both!
- Stop watching us!
- No, Nate!
They're not gonna watch me die!
- No!
-
What are you doing? Stop!
Stop! Come on, you're...!
Nate!
Liberty, this is Freedom.
Do you read me?
Liberty, this is Freedom.
I don't know if you can hear me,
but I'm gonna be out of comm range soon.
Guys, we need to get you
out of there ASAP. Do you copy?
Come on, guys.
Don't make me leave you here.
-
- Freedom, do you read me?
John?
John, can you hear me?
Please, anyone, can you hear me?
Abandoning Liberty.
- Come on!
- I had to do it.
Take the camera.
We're at 25 percent
in the tank...
...20 minutes on reserve.
It'll get us there.
I gotta grab the film.
The black box for DOD.
We gotta go now. It's clear.
Come on, Nate, let's go.
They're everywhere.
You can't help me.
You're not supposed to be here.
Ben, it's OK.
It's gonna be OK.
We'll make it, OK?
We're gonna make it.
They're waiting for me.
We're not safe here.
- Get rid of me!
- Hang in there!
It's just me they want!
It's just me!
- What the hell are you doing?
- Let me off!
Just hang on!
Nate!
Nate!

Rover's been destroyed.
There's no sign of Commander Walker.

Nate!
Get away from me, Ben.
This is where they're coming from.
There's nothing here, OK?
You gotta come with me.
Goddamn it!
We need to get moving!
Ben, listen to me.
We're runnin'
out of time here, please.
You gotta find the LK. Their
systems aren't that different from ours.
Save yourself.
No, Nate, I am not going.
You're coming with me.
You have to leave me here.
Just get to John.
I am not leaving here!
You can't help me,
but you can save your...
Nate!
Nate!
Jesus, Nate! Can you hear me?
Nate, answer me!
Do you hear me?
Say something, please!
Nate, where are you?
Oh, no, no! Oh, my God!
No! Christ!
No!
Oh, no! John, Nate's gone!
Repeat, Nate is gone!
Please! Can anybody hear me?
Oh, come on, come on!
Come on, electricity!
Got it!
Come on!
Repress is almost complete.

Communicating with the Russians
and they are patching me through to you.

No, no, no.
No, listen to me, please.
Listen, Nate got a cut on his body,
he got infected.
There's nothing on me.
Please, you have to come get me.
We can't take the risk.
We can't bring you back to Earth.

And you'll fuckin' pick me up right now!
I did my job!
You do your job, you get me home!

We'll stay on this channel with you,
but this decision's final.
You've done a great service
for your country, son, and for mankind.

Astronaut Ryan Anderson,
with his dad, flying through space.
-  Ryan, what are you doing?
-  Just playing, Mom.
Don't play
with your dad's stuff
- Baby, is that recording?
-  Sorry, Dad. Love you.

-
-  Baby, is that recording?

- Love you.
This is Freedom,
do you read me?
Liberty, this is Freedom.
Do you read me?
- Liberty, this is Freedom.
- Yes, John, it's Ben. I hear you!
Yes, John, this is Ben.
I hear you, copy.
I got you on the VHF, partner.
Where the hell are you?
- I'm in the LK.
- Yes! Goddamn.
Where's Nate? How is he?
He got sick and he didn't make it.
There's something down here, John.
And they knew about it. You hear me?
Those bastards knew about it!
Ben, I'm gonna get you outta there, OK?
You think you can pilot that thing?
- ...Pilot that thing?
- I don't have much a choice, do I?
Pilot ails look good, and there's...
there's plenty of fuel.
OK, buddy, you're not gonna
be able to dock with the CSM,
so you're gonna need
to get into a synchronized orbit
and you're gonna need to do
a little spacewalk... step on board.
Sounds beautiful, Johnny.
Sounds really beautiful.
I don't mean to rush you, partner,
but we are running out of time.
Tick-tock. You get that thing
into orbit, we can rendezvous.
-
- I got it!
I got it, John!
Seven... six...
...five...
-
- Holy shit!
- Open this door.
Nate, you know I can't do that.
Please, you'll kill us both!
- I can't let you in.
- Then I'm comin' in.
No, no, no, no!
Nate, you'll kill us both! Please!
-  What do you mean, Nate?
- Please! Nate!
- What do you mean, Nate? Nate's dead!
- No! Stop!
- Please! Stop!
-  What's goin' on?!
- Stop!
- What's going on?!
No, Nate, don't do it, please! Please!
Jesus Christ! No!
Nate?
Nate. Oh, Christ. Nate!
No, no! No, no, no!
All right, Ben, if you
can launch, you need to do it now.
Our window is almost gone.
You need to launch!
Goddamn it, Ben,
we are cuttin' it way too close.
Benny, we are goin' home!
You hear me?
We're gonna go home.
I'm comin' home. I'm comin' home.
I have liftoff.
Ben has been contaminated.
Do not try to rescue him.
Contaminated by what? DOD?
What are you saying?
Where's Tommy?
You will not recover Anderson.
That is a direct order.
I'm on my way.
John, you are ordered
to abort rescue immediately.
Captain Anderson
is a high contamination threat.
You knew something was down
there and you sent them anyway.
I'm comin' home.
I'm comin' home, Ryan.
I'm comin' home.
DOD to Freedom, if you do not abort
in T-minus 60 seconds,
You will not receive
an updated state vector.
You will run out of life support
package. You will not return home.
You have 45 seconds
to abort this rescue.
John, we have no choice.
We are begging you, do not do this.
Goddamn it, Benny!
We are goin' home!
Engine cutoff. I'm in orbit!
-
- Ben! Ben!
Forget about me, John.
Get outta here.
Ben, you're coming in too fast.
- We're gonna impact! Slow it down!
-
- Ben!
-
Ben!
Ben!

We choose to go to the moon in this
decade and do the other things,
not because they are easy,
but because they are hard.
The voyage of Apollo
dramatized its risk.
The men of Apollo
