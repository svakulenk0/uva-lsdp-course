-  What?
-  I was just thinking of a time.
- You want to hear it?
-  Play something else.
No, no, no. It's a good one.
You just turned 15, you were a senior,
you took me out
in Mom's old station wagon.
Remember? The Dragon Wagon.
You were gonna teach me how to drive.
And there was that one tree...
...banged into the car
while we were inside...
That's right.
- You actually lied for me.
-  I lied for me.
No, come on.
You lied for both of us.
You actually did something
decent for me.
That's a part of history
you can't change.
- That was a stop sign.
- You're kidding, right?
In your car, I'd be kidding.
On this road?
I haven't seen a car in 50 miles.
.
"Gay Fever!"
No, "Gay Forever."
"Gay Forever." That's mine.
That's three for little bro'.
That's a six, not a G, you idiot.
That's "Sexy Forever." That's mine.
- That's five to two.
- Shit.
"Gay Fever"?
Sexy forever, huh?
- You know that is you in 40 years.
- Yeah...
There's usually a reason
when you like the long way home.
Gee, like,
maybe I like the country?
- OK.
- Just drive, brat.
I'm only thinking the same thing
Mom and Dad are gonna be thinking.
"Trisha, why
are you driving home for spring break
with your brat brother and not
heading off somewhere with that nice
'Mr. Poli-Sci-Track-Team Guy'?"
I will tell them the
same thing I'll tell you:
None of your
goddamn business.
What?
You don't think I could understand the
complex nature of your relationships?
No, I look at you as a real expert.
- Huh, whatever. I don't care.
-
I'm just saying,
if you broke it off with him,
you should at least figure out
what you're gonna tell Mom and Dad.
-  guy.
-
I am no fanatic.
What I am, is a fan of God!
...a serpent-headed demon,
shaking you by the...
-
- You wanted the back way home.
That's ten hours of preachers,
farm reports...
Could you possibly just
shut up and drive, please?
Come on, girl, sing along now.
When I met you
I thought I would die
- Jesus!
-
- What the hell is his problem?
- Just get out of his way, Darryl
Let him pass you, Darry!
What are you doing?
Go around me!
Get off the road
and let him pass you!
- He's nuts!
- I know he's nuts. Pull over!
Go around me!
Slow down and let him
fucking pass you!
I'm trying!
- Jesus!
- Shit!
What the hell was his problem?
My first guess? Inbreeding!
Get a load of that nasty old thing.
What is that, the vehicle of choice
for assholes and fucking serial killers?
God.
You know what I just thought of, right?
Kenny and Darla?
- They died about a 100 miles from here.
- The same highway.
This highway runs
the length of the state.
You believe it?
That they had to go
looking for her head?
That they never found them,
only the car.
No, they never found her head.
They found the car.
- Didn't find him or her head.
- Look at me, I'm still shaking!
You don't think every generation
has their cautionary tale
of drinking and driving
on prom night?
I don't know. I always heard it was
true. Wheaton Valley High, class of '78.
- You wanna know something?
- Hmm.
- When I first heard that story...
- Hmm.
...I used to think this was
the highway I would die on.
Quite the cheery thinker today,
aren't we, sis? God.
What's "Poli-Sci Guy"
been doing to you, anyway?
"Beating you"?
That was the license plate
on the van we just saw.
B-E-A-T-N-G-U.
So "Beating You."
That's mine.
That's three to five.
- You can't call it now.
- My ass!
- You have to call it when you see it.
- I was in shock!
- Tough!
- What is this, a brand-new rule?
It's not a new rule,
it's always been this way.
- Since when?
-  Since always.
Since just now, maybe.
- Your memory's for shit.
- No, it's not.
- Uh-huh.
- Nah-uh.
- Uh-huh.
- Nah-uh.
- Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
- Nah-uh. Nah-uh.
- Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
- Nah-uh. Nah-uh.
Nah-ha, infinity.
Uh-huh, infinity squared.
-  OK, name it.
-  What?
When we made the rule that you
had to call it as soon as you see it.
-  Would you give it up already?
- No.
That's 'cause the rule has always been
the first person who calls it, gets it.
- You talk to Mom lately?
- To tell her I'd be home for break.
She sound weird?
- What?
- Did you listen to her voice?
- Could you specify, please?
- Forget it.
Did you drink the last water?
The last one was mine.
Damn it.
Oh, you are a class act, you know that?
You live off-campus.
You ever try and do laundry in a dorm?
What they don't steal, they dye pink.
I've got 12 pairs of
rosy-pink Jockey shorts.
Maybe they know
something about you you don't.
"Hi, Mom. Haven't seen you in forever.
Here's my dirty shorts." Nice.
It's for her, not me.
What? I have to bring home laundry.
If I don't, she gets depressed.
She thinks I don't
need her anymore or something.
-
- I'm serious.
- Goof.
- Bitch.
- Mama's boy.
- Daddy's whore.
- Dick licker.
- Ball sniffer.
- Ass kisser.
- Butt picker.
Repeat.
"Ass" and "butt." You lose.
I think maybe
something's wrong.
You always
think something's wrong.
Like you'd notice
anything past the point
of your own selfish little existence.
She's not happy.
- Not like she used to be.
- Who is?
Mom's not...
Hey...
It's "Beating You."
What's he doing?
What the hell is that?
What the hell was he doing?
He dumped something
down that pipe.
Wrapped in a sheet.
Wrapped and roped in a sheet.
Wrapped and roped in a sheet
with red stains on it.
- Just get us out of here.
- All right.
- Grab my cell phone.
- Where?
It's in the gym bag.
-  Oh, Jesus...
-
Oh, you've gotta be
kidding me.
The point of having a portable phone
is that it works when you need it!
I have a power cable for it.
Yeah, and I have a cigarette lighter
that doesn't work.
Goddamnit,
what did I say? My car!
We should've taken my car!
He's coming up right on our ass.
What the hell has he got in that thing?
He's got it souped-up or something.
-
- Darry...
- He's coming up right on our ass.
- What does he have in that thing?
-
-
- You're out of your fucking mind!
-
-
-
What the hell's your problem?
-
- Fuck me! Go!
- What the hell's the matter with you!
-
- Darry, what are you doing?
- Hang on.
Just don't kill us, OK?
Sounds all right.
What?
- Like either of us would know.
- I know a little.
Your car makes a strange noise, you just
get a new tape, Darry. You told me.
I told you?
I learned it from you.
Jesus Christ...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, wait.
I'm thinking past the point of my own
selfish little existence now, OK?
We're both pretty damn sure
what we saw him
dump down that pipe, right?
What if it's someone still alive?
What if it was?
Someone who needs help.
We can get help just as fast
by getting to a phone.
You have any idea how far
we are from the nearest phone?
We were just attacked!
And you don't even
wanna find out why?
We look in the pipe, that's it.
Is this your idea of a
little adventure or something?
'Cause this is why
girls are smarter, OK?
We look in the pipe, if there's
nothing there, nothing we can do,
we just drive on home
and call the cops.
You know that's what we should do.
- Bullshit, I do.
- Bullshit, you don't!
Look me in the eye and tell me
you can just drive away.
Drive off, leave whosever
back there, back there.
Maybe find out later they'd still
be alive if you'd just gone back.
Don't make this about
the right thing to do.
You just wanna go back there
and see if there's something nasty
at the end of that pipe.
OK.
And what if
it was you back there?
I'm not getting out of this car.
- You don't have to.
- I'm not.
Jesus, it's a church.
What's with all the birds?
I'm just gonna look.
Let's just do this,
and do it fast.
- Oh, my God.
- Ohh...
- Doesn't look like a sewer pipe.
- Yeah, doesn't smell like one either.
Come on, I can't
see anything in there.
You can see
light down there.
Get a flashlight.
Come on, get a flashlight.
Hello!
Anybody down there?
Hey! Anybody down there?
Hello!
Hurry up. Come on.
Hello!
There's someone down there,
I just heard them. Hello!
You're hearing things, Darry.
Darry, don't even
think about it!
- Darry!
- I told you I heard someone.
You know the part
in scary movies
where somebody does
something really stupid,
and everybody hates
them for it? This is it.
- Hello!
- No, Darryl
- Let me slide down.
- Goddamnit!
- Let me get a little way in.
- You're not going down there.
I'm not. Just hold my feet.
The feet?
Anybody down there?
When was the last time
you washed these socks?
I see something.
- Hello!
- I am counting to ten.
Something's moving down there.
And then I am letting go
and going back to my car.
Quiet! I just saw it again.
OK, something is definitely
moving down there.
- Darryl
- It's rats!
-  What?
- Rats!
Rats! It's rats!
Rats!
Darry!
Oh, God, Darry, talk to me!
Darry, say something!
Are you OK?
How the hell are you gonna
get out of there, Dar?
Aah!
- Oh, you suck.
-  Oh...
- God, I am so sorry.
- Oh, I bet you are.
I am.
I don't know what happened.
You were kicking,
and I couldn't hold on...
Not as sorry as I am.
Hey, there were rats coming at my face.
They were running at me too, Trish.
I feel really bad. Are you OK?
Thank you so much, by the way.
Thank you for this.
Trisha Jenner,
coming through in the clutch.
Thank you.
You were the one
who wanted to come back here
- and have a little adventure.
- Oh, shut up.
How the hell are you gonna
get out of there?
What?
Say it isn't so.
Hello...
Did I hear you talking?
Darry, who in the holy hell
are you talking to down there?
I found our body.
-  You what?
- I found our...
-
-
- Jesus! Get off!
-  Darry! Darry! Darry!
What?
-
- What? What?
Darry?
Say something.
You're scaring the shit out of me!
Darry, tell me what's going on!
What?
- We gotta get out of here.
- No, let's stay and feed the birds.
Get help.
Get help, Trish.
What are you looking at?
Get out to the road
and find somebody who can help.
How are you gonna get out of there?
This is some kind of basement,
right, for the church?
Oh, you don't think
I'm going in there, do you?
Get out to the road,
flag down anyone you see,
tell them to get the cops
out here right away.
There's gotta be a way out.
I'm gonna find it.
And, Trish...
...if you see that old truck coming,
you get back to this pipe,
you holler down as loud as you can.
You just had to say that, right?
-
-
You asshole!
Dar?
Would you please
just say something?
Darry, you're scaring
the shit out of me!
We have to stop.
Did you hear me?
- Darry?
- She did lose her head.
Darla lost her head,
just like they said.
And you know what he did, Trish?
You know what he did for her?
He sewed it back on.
He sewed it right back on.
- You gonna make a phone call?
- Mm-hmm.
Throw some water on yourself.
You look like you just
crawled out of a sewer.
He's going back.
He's going back.
Come on! Come on!
Excuse me.
Excuse me, we need help.
I need you
to please call the police.
The police?
We need help now, please!
OK.
Just go tell them what you saw
so we can get out of here, OK?
Come on, brat!
I mean it.
I need you to hold it together.
.
I'm so scared, Trish.
- I am so scared.
- Hey... I'm scared, too, all right?
He's gonna get back to that church,
and he's gonna know that we were there.
-
-
-
-
Are you gonna get that?
- Yeah, hello.
-  Have you seen the cats yet?
- You and your brother.
- Me and my brother?
You and Darry.
I saw you with lots of cats.
Who the hell is this?
How do you know Darry?
Who is this?
"
" H
-
-
Shirt's torn just above
a small rose tattoo on your stomach.
Who is this?
-
-
- The what'?
- Those bodies down there,
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.
or just some hungry thing
from some dark place in time.
Look, I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.
I just know it's not gonna
stop coming after you
'Cause once it has the scent
of something it likes...
...it can't... it can't stop.
-  Is what...
-  What is she saying?
- I saw that awful truck, too.
-
With the license plate.
-  You?"
- Right, "Beating You"?
- No, think about it.
- What?
- Think about it, for Christ's sake.
Oh, hold on.
I need you to listen to this.
Jeepers, creepers
Where'd you get those peepers?
Jeepers, creepers
Where'd you get those eyes?
- OK.
- You hear that song, you run.
'Cause that song means
something terrible for you.
Something so terrible
you couldn't dream of it,
not in your worst,
most terrible nightmare.
Fuck you, lady!
-.
Darry?
Hello?
Let's talk with the cops
and get the hell out of here.
-
-
Maybe you should've left out
the part about that phone call.
It just sounds too much
like a bad dream.
Well, everything
I said I saw, I saw.
What, you think I bumped my head
down there or something?
- I didn't say that.
- You believe me, right?
Right?
Hey, look me in the eye
and tell me you believe me.
Look me right in the eye right now, you
tell me you believe everything I said!
OK, we're running the plates,
and we've got some people
on their way out to the old church.
- And?
- These kids you saw on that wall,
who were they again?
Darla Cleeway and Kenny...
- Brandon.
- ...Brandon.
Found their car all smashed up
about 20 years ago.
- Am I remembering this right?
- Yeah.
Those bodies would be
nothing but bones by now.
You said they still had skin on them
and he had a ring on his finger.
What are you saying?
I told you,
I grabbed one of them like this.
And it was hard,
like petrified wood.
Like he preserved them
or something.
He's got them all stitched together
like some kind of quilt.
I'm just trying
to get all the facts here.
And I told you the facts!
This guy drives an old brown truck
and it nearly killed us.
We saw him
throw a body down a pipe
that dumps into the cellar
of that old church.
This guy must have five...
maybe 600 bodies down there,
- and I've seen them!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey...
Stuck up on the walls like some
psycho version of the Sistine Chapel!
What, you don't believe me?
Drive out to the old church, if you
don't believe me, you think I'm lying.
- No one's saying you're lying.
- Good, because I'm not lying!
Look at this from my point of view, OK?
This is a pretty big story
you're laying on us here.
Hey! That's your car out
at the pumps, isn't it?
A bunch of folks saw him
from the window.
The man there at your car.
He was standing there at your car
sniff in' that laundry...
...holding big handfuls of it
under his nose.
Looked like he was liking it, too.
Which way he run off, Binky?
Still think I bumped my head?
Huh?
He had time to get to the church,
then back here.
This guy is after us!
And he's after us
'cause he knows what we saw.
And now he even knows my name.
- Central, this is 037. Come back.
-  Hey!
You interested in a hand print?
You can dust that, right?
Get a print?
Looks like somebody already did.
There is something after us,
there's some weird shit going on.
This is Central.
We should all just get in
the car and go. We should just go.
How'd he get to the church
and back to the diner so fast?
What the hell was he doing
with your clothes?
He drives fast,
but not that fast.
Maybe he can leap tall buildings
in a single bound.
He'd have to be superhuman.
Otherwise, the smell
would've killed him.
Please come back, 037,
out there on East 9.
Central, this is 037. Go ahead.
Yeah, you sure that's not
a couple of little pyromaniacs
-
- Go ahead.
I'm up to my ass in Fire and Rescue,
but I can tell you right now
no one's going inside this thing
for a long time.
...incest capital of the world.
Don't be such a snot.
- Don't tell me you actually like him.
- Huh? Who?
Oh, please.
When he walked in, I thought the
waitress had dialed the wrong number.
The guy looked like
a strip-o-gram cop.
Like the missing link.
I wanna bring him to my
Anthro class for show and tell.
-  In sports, the national...
-
-   Jeepers...
-
-
-  Jeepers...
- That's the song!
- What's the matter with you?
The words are the same. Listen.
Creepshow
where did you get those eyes...
What is the matter with you?
That's the song! That's the same song
she was playing, that lady on the phone.
These kids say the vehicle chased them
doing over 100, go ahead.
A preliminary came back on
that dust you took off the car handle.
It's dead skin. Long dead.
That's why it was powder.
- Say what?
-
That's the song!
The words are the same, listen!
"Jeepers, creepers,
where'd you get those weepers."
-
- Hold on, Central, the sky is falling.
-
-
She was playing this song to us,
and she said if we heard it...
This is it.
-
-
-  037, come in.
-  Hey!
You OK in there?
Tflsh?
- I said hello!
- Get back in the car.
- Central, this is
- Get back in the car, Trish!
What is that?
I'm not seeing this.
What is he doing?
Go.
- Go.
-
-  I'm trying.
_ G9, 9Q, go, go, go, go!
GO, go! go!
- Go, go, go!
- I'm trying!
-
- Go!
Come on, you're gonna kill us!
I mean it, slow down!
Slow down!
No way.
- There's a phone.
- So?
- So you just told me to stop.
- I didn't say, "Stop."
I said, "Slow down."
- How far's the next town?
- You mean the next phone?
'Cause it's pretty goddamn far.
You wanna wait to find out?
Come on, Trish, look at this place.
Let's just keep going.
I mean it, come on.
- You don't wanna get help?
- Help from who?
We'll just use the phone, OK?
- And call who?
- I don't know.
- And tell them what?
- I don't know.
"Hey, bum-fuck police,
I'm being chased by a guy
who likes to pull tongues out of
severed heads with his teeth.
Is there a special extension
for that?" Come on.
Christ, do you think
they even have a phone?
I'm guessing no phone
and a lot of guns.
Who are you?
-
-
I said, "Who are you?"
Um... Patricia Jenner.
This is my brother, Darry.
-  What do you want?
- A telephone?
I don't have one.
I say we keep driving
till we see people.
- What do you think she is?
-
What you need a phone for if I had one?
I need to call the
Pertwilla County Police.
Pertwilla?
That's one county back.
You're in Poho County.
Then Poho Police,
but I need to call someone.
Don't even think about bringing the
cops out here with their zoning crap.
They try to tell me
how many cats people can have.
I'll have
as many cats as I wanna have.
You can tell them that for me.
Please, someone's been killed.
Killed, you say?
- Yeah, a policeman.
-  Holy Jesus, I thought...
- I thought you meant one of my babies.
-
- Did you hear what I just said?
- Let's get out of here.
You can call the Sheriff's station,
just don't give them this address.
And tell them to go out on the
interstate where they ought to be.
My babies don't like strangers.
Um... How many babies do you have?
More than a couple.
We've gotta
get out of here right now.
Tell me this happens all the time.
Holy shit.
You kids
got anyone else with you?
What?
That's not my scarecrow.
-
-
You got ten seconds
to get your ass out of my yard!
And don't think
I'm gonna tell you twice.
- Get the hell away from him.
- What are you doing, Trish?
Get the hell away from him!
-
-
- Come on. Let's go.
- No. Don't you go up there.
- Listen to him!
- We gotta get out of here now!
What the hell did you
bring into my house?
-
- Get out of here.
Get away from my babies,
you sons of bitches!
I'll blow your fucking head off!
Hello?
-  Ah...
-
Ah...
Ah...
-
-
-  Something's wrong.
- Don't say that!
What do you want me to say?
The gears are sticking!
- Unstick them, Trish!
- You're gonna break it!
" Go!
- It's stuck in reverse!
- Go in reverse!
-  What do we do?
- Hit him.
Hit him, Trish. Hard.
Do it!
What the hell is that thing?
What are you doing?
What the hell are you doing?
Come on, you son of a bitch.
That's right,
walk that ugly face right over here.
Come on. Come on!
-
-
Do you think he's dead?
They never are.
-
-
Enough.
Let's get out of here.
Trish. Trish!
I don't know how much further
this car is gonna go.
- Not far enough.
-
We'll clear you for that,
if you could head to...
Roach.
What are we boosting tonight?
Why don't you come over here
and find out, Big Daddy?
'76 Chevy Nova, huh?
Anyone ever tell you, for a car thief,
you got taste for shit?
Would you tell Dad
to stop shouting, please?
Mom!
I understand that, Mother. I'm just
trying to tell you where we are.
Standing right here.
I told you, we're both OK.
It's the Poho County Sheriff's Station,
about 20 miles outside Pertwilla.
Because we'll be home
before you could get here.
We don't wanna wait here, Mom.
We just wanna get the hell out of here.
Mom, just let us get home, OK?
We don't wanna be out here
any more than you do.
Me, too.
I'll talk to you in a few hours.
Dad.
- Thought I wrecked the car?
- Mm-hmm.
She's trailer trash.
-  Pig fucker.
- Booger eater.
Tflsha?
- Trisha and Darry, right?
- Jez, what are you doing here?
Excuse me, Jezelle?
-.
Jenner.
- Jezelle Gay Hartman. How do you do?
- Come on. They've been through a lot.
- Trisha?
- Goddamnit, Jez.
I really need to talk to you,
if you could just spare me a minute.
Jezelle likes to think she's
the resident psychic here.
- She helped us on a missing persons...
-
Do you think I could just
talk to these kids by myself?
You go home, turn off that
police scanner, and go to bed.
You got missing persons
and a fire in the next county.
Go do something useful.
- I mean it, now, leave them alone.
-
You don't have to believe I'm psychic.
You don't have to believe a word I say.
But I've come a
very long way to see you.
You know, I'm not sure we should be
talking to anybody right now.
Let's go.
You found all those bodies...
...down in that cellar.
I saw them, too.
How?
Dreamed it.
I dream a lot of things.
You see the cats yet?
I saw you with all those cats, too.
The diner.
That was you. You called us.
Will you excuse me for a second?
- Darry, I need to talk...
- I need you to listen and not talk, OK?
Truth be, I'd be lying if I said I knew
that telling you this would do any good.
Any good? What does that mean?
Every 23rd spring...
...for 23 days...
...it gets to... eat.
Eat?
You know what it eats,
and don't you make me tell you.
You think I like
having this in my head?
Well, I don't.
I don't like knowing this,
and not knowing why I do.
You said it eats?
Only certain things...
...from certain people.
- Just get away from her.
It eats lungs so it can breathe...
...and eyes so it can see.
It all becomes a part of it.
Whatever it eats...
becomes a part of it.
-
-  You hurt it,
- out there on the road...
-
'Cause it can keep on eating
till it isn't hurt no more.
You've got something it likes,
one of you.
And it's not gonna stop chasing you
till it knows which one.
- How?
- Never mind how.
How does it find out,
by running people off the road?
It needs to scare you.
There's something in fear,
something it can smell.
Something that tells it
if there's anything inside someone
that it might... like.
You're telling us this thing
is out driving down the highway
trying to freak people out
so it can smell them?
Christ, Darry!
Why are we standing here with her?
Hey, hey! Whoa!
Hello?
We got lights and phones out up here!
Would somebody talk to me?
No, it's gone.
We ran it over till
there was nothing left.
What the hell,
have we got emergency lights or what?
All right, people, we're
going into a lockdown situation.
That means everybody sit tight.
Don't move unless somebody
wearing a badge tells you to.
We pounded it to dust.
We watched it blow the fuck away.
I think it's eaten too many hearts
for its own to ever stop.
Heads up, gentlemen. Heads up.
Let's see some skin.
Are you in a coma, buddy?
What the hell is wrong with you, man?
We have a blackout.
That means emergency head count.
Hey, lower bunk, let me see some skin.
That is special. I love you, too.
Heads up. Move it, down there.
Thank you. Thank you for joining us.
Show me some skin, that's it.
Heads up, gentlemen.
OK, you two.
You kids wanna come with me?
We're putting you in a
holding room down the hall. This way.
You can't do that!
He finds you in here!
- He finds you hiding in a room!
- You, too.
Jeepers, creepers
Where'd you get those peepers? a'
- We heard it in the car hours ago.
- No.
It's playing on an old phonograph.
Escort Jezelle here
to the big blue Winnebago
she's no doubt
blocking the driveway with.
Jeepers, creepers
Where'd you get those eyes? a'
I swear I will lock you up, Jez.
I hear it playing
while one of you is screaming.
Screaming down in the dark somewhere.
Screaming the last scream
you'll ever scream!
- Goddamnit, knock it off!
- What exactly are you doing here?
Up top? Anybody on ground level?
We have an 11-99.
-  repeat, an 11-99.
- This is Tubbs, go ahead.
It's headed towards you,
up the rear stairs. You copy?
-  here.
-
- I'm gonna get you out of here.
Come on, I said!
Let's go!
Somebody down there talk to me.
We have one inmate
and one officer down.
The son of a bitch
tried to take a bite out of him.
- He what?
-
'Cause I'm a son of a bitch,
but we cannot take him down.
What the hell do you mean,
"wearing something"?
You'd think I was crazy if I told you
what this looked like.
This is about the weirdest fucking
body armor you've ever seen.
-
- Where... Where is he?
- Talk.
- He's gone.
He's gone, Sarge. This guy
just climbed up the fucking wall.
You are not making
one goddamn bit of sense.
You can put me in a straitjacket,
but this fucker is gone.
Gone? What the hell you talking about?
This guy's a real
mover and a shaker, Sarge.
He's heading
right up to you. Copy?
What is it?
Move, move, move, move!
Stay tight!
-
-
Shit.
This is your way out?
These must lock automatically
if the power's out.
- You didn't know that?
- I don't dream everything!
This isn't everything!
This is our way out!
It's not like watching a movie, honey.
There are parts missing sometimes.
-
-
We have to get out of here now.
There's no other way except the front...
Well, the front door is out. Why
don't you dream up something useful?
I thought if you knew what I saw,
maybe you could change it.
Why the hell do you think I'm here?
You know.
Don't you?
You knew when you walked in.
You know who it wants.
- You know what it wants.
-  I've dreamed this.
You know
what's gonna happen.
You will run up the stairs and hide,
but I don't know what happens to me.
"Jeepers Creepers."
"J eepe rs Creepers," rig ht?
Who?
Who hears "Jeepers Creepers"
while screaming in the dark?
Huh?
Are they ever wrong?
I don't believe you.
- You don't understand.
- Your dreams, are they ever wrong?
- You go to hell.
- I said, "You don't understand."
Are they ever wrong?
Are your dreams ever wrong?
She doesn't know.
She doesn't know shit.
Get upstairs!
NOW!
Our Father, who art in heaven
hallowed be Thy...
Huh?
-
-
-
"
What in the holy name of God?
Oh, God...
Take me.
You don't want him. You don't want him.
Whatever you want,
you can take it from me.
You don't want Darry.
No, you don't.
Don't you... Don't you be a hero!
I have everything the same inside.
You take me!
-  It's OK.
- You hear me? You take me.
- You fucking let him go!
-
Please. Please, let him go.
- Trish, please don't do this.
- Just think for a second.
I won't fight you. You can take me.
I'm stronger. You want me.
Drop him.
Let him go and take me.
You let him go!
Darry!
Darry!
Darry!
Darry!
-
-
Your folks just pulled up outside.
You never answered him.
Are your dreams ever wrong?
Darry screaming in the dark
while that song is playing.
What did that mean?
What did you really see?
I'm just a crazy old woman.
You ask anyone around here,
they'll tell you.
That's all I am.
Just a crazy old woman with...
crazy dreams.
Golly, gee, when you
turn those heaters on
Woe is me
got to put my cheaters on
Jeepers, creepers
Where'd you get those peepers?
