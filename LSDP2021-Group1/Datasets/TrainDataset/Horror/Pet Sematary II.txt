Cut. Thank you very much, Renee.
I'm sorry. He grabbed me.
I'm sorry. He keeps missing my arms.
- Frank, why don't we give this up?
- Frank. I can't see a damn thing.
- OK.
- Sorry, Renee.
Tell me the truth. You get off
on seeing me suffer, don't you?
- OK.
- Water everywhere.
Can I get a cigarette?
Guys, we've gotta sort this out. You
think you can hit your mark this time?
It's not a matter of hitting the mark.
There's not a damn thing to see.
OK, look, but I need...
Jeff.
I'm right here, Mom.
- How long have you been here?
- Couple of minutes.
- How was your stay with your father?
- Good.
He wants to come down to the set
for dinner, if it's all right.
I mean...
What I'm really tryin' to say
is he misses you.
Dinner would be great.
I just don't want you
gettin' your hopes up, OK?
- We're tryin' to work things out, but...
- I know, Mom.
OK, people, quiet.
Final touches, now's the time.
I think it's showtime.
Jeff?
I love you.
- Roll, please.
- OK, camera rolling.
scene 13, take 33.
OK. Action, Renee.
Cut. For Christ's sake, cut!
There's a dead short.
We've lost the neutral.
Cut the power.
Mom!
I know this is hard for you, but
I think you made the right decision.
He was a very old dog.
He had a good life.
Dr Matthews, your son is on line one.
He says it's an emergency.
Can you take...? Excuse me.
Jeff, what's goin' on?
I am the resurrection
and the life, sayeth the Lord.
She who believeth in me, though
she were dead, yet she shall live.
Whosoever liveth and
believeth in me shall never die.
I know my Redeemer liveth,
and that he shall stand
until the latter day upon the earth.
Friends, let us bow our heads
in silent prayer.
Friends, our service is now concluded.
Here we go.
Come on, folks, keep it back.
Show a little respect, now.
- Excuse me. I know it's a difficult time...
- Obviously you boys didn't hear me.
Show a little respect.
You probably don't remember me,
Chase. I'm Gus Gilbert, town sheriff.
I remember you.
I hear you're movin' in to the summer
house. Do you plan on stayin' full time?
Just wanted to get my son,
Jeff, outta LA.
Start things over.
- My deepest regrets.
- Thank you.
We got six of these wardrobe boxes.
You sure you want them all in the attic?
What do you say we give the clothes
to Goodwill? We'll keep the rest.
You're the one who wanted to move.
All the "Renee" boxes in the attic.
All right.
Hi. I'm Marjorie Hargrove,
your new housekeeper.
Hi.
Is something wrong?
No. You just look different than you
sounded on the phone. Please, come in.
I'm real excited to be working
for you, Mr. Matthews.
Well, we're glad to have you, Marjorie.
This is my son, Jeff,
and you can call me Chase. OK?
You know, I adored Miss Hallow.
- That one goes in the attic.
- Say what? Look out.
I'll get that.
This is gorgeous.
This is what she wore
at the Emmys, isn't it?
Don't touch her stuff. It made her crazy
when people touched her stuff.
I'm sorry.
It's OK.
Wait up, I'm comin' with.
That's great. I could sure use your help.
Let's go. Come on.
This isn't too bad.
It's pretty bad.
God, how long ago did this guy retire?
It's been a few years.
A few.
- Well, what's down there?
- I think the kennels are in the back.
- What happened? Are you all right?
- Yeah. I'm all right.
I just got spooked
by a bunch of furballs.
Great. So, now I've
opened up an orphanage, too?
If it's OK, I'd like to take one.
All right, I'll tell you what.
You clean up these old kennels
and she's yours.
All right.
Thanks, Dad.
Come on, kitties.
No, Zowie.
Zowie, come back.
Drew, you get a handle on that dog.
- Sorry, he gets kinda hyper.
- That's all right.
Thought it was lunch.
How are you? You met my boy?
- No.
- Drew, where are your manners?
He's a cool-lookin' dog.
What's his name?
Zowie.
What happened, Zowie?
Damn dog stuck his nose in on my
rabbits. They ganged up on him.
I swear that dog is dumber
than lobster bait.
- Is he gonna be OK?
- I'm not really set up yet,
but I'll take a quick look.
Come on, Zowie.
It's OK, boy. Up on the table.
Good boy.
Let me look at you here. Let's see.
When I was younger, I thought cats
were the girls and dogs were boys.
Well, there's three more girls where
that one came from lookin' for homes.
Not our home.
Facial lacerations -
they'll heal up pretty quickly.
- I'll give you some antibiotic ointment.
- Drew, you listenin'? It's your dog.
He has corneal abrasions, scratches
on the surface of his right eye.
These eye drops'll help,
but it'll still take time,
so try to keep him away
from those rabbits.
Thanks.
Jeff, did you hear your mother
and I used to be sweethearts?
Really?
Yeah. Prom, homecomin'.
Whole nine yards.
Course, that was a lifetime ago.
Check it out.
Celebrity boy.
You will take your seats
and settle down, please.
- What's Hollywood like?
- Excuse me, at the back?
Would you settle down, please?
What's the hurry, junior?
Where you off to?
Sorry about your mom.
Papers said it was pretty gross,
gettin' fried like that.
Who you got there?
You're supposed to introduce friends.
Yeah. What's the cat's name, junior?
Tiger.
Don't you think that's
kind of a pussy name?
Can I hold her?
Promise I'll be real careful.
Jeff, you ever seen a kitten run before?
- Yeah.
- No, I mean really run.
Like this.
Shit.
You havin' fun yet?
- Gimme the cat, all right?
- I would, but there was a little accident.
She was trying to get away,
and her head got caught in the spokes.
What's left of her
is back there in the Pet Sematary.
- You heard about the Creed murders?
- You heard about where the dead rise?
Just back there, Jeff.
Just down that path.
Come on, Clyde,
just tell him where the cat is.
I told him where the cat is.
Shut up, dickwad.
What are you gonna do, fat ass?
You gonna sic big bad old Gus on me?
What do you think, Jeff? Maybe
you could go dig up your old lady,
bury her back there.
And maybe if you pray real hard,
- maybe she'll come back.
- Yeah, right.
You showed him.
Punk.
You showed him good.
Asshole.
This way, fat boy.
See ya.
There you go.
I've never seen anybody
punch Clyde before.
He pissed me off.
Sorry about your mom.
She sure was beautiful.
You never really think
your parents are gonna die.
Sometimes I wish Gus would die.
You shouldn't say that about your dad.
Stepdad. Gus is my stepdad.
So what was all that stuff
about people coming back to life?
Nothing. It's just an old ghost story.
Let's get outta here.
I agree.
There you go.
Dammit.
Thank you.
- How was school today?
- It sucked.
The first day of school
is always the hardest.
You're not my mother.
Jeff.
Live action resumes at the
Cumberland County Civic Center...
Drew, I don't remember
invitin' Zowie in for dinner.
- Just until he heals up?
- Don't start with me.
Hi, beautiful.
Gus...
Hi.
Gus.
Stop it.
You're breakin' the law.
Turn it off.
Your mother spent the last hour
cookin'. Show some appreciation.
Really, Gus, it doesn't bother me.
Attaboy.
There you go.
Not that much appreciation.
I thought we were gonna
tone down on your flabby ass.
Hey. I'm so sorry
I'm not the stud you are.
OK. Knock it off, guys.
You better watch your mouth, buddy.
I'll take that "hey" and shove it
right back down your throat.
You understand?
- Where's your boyfriend?
- I don't know.
Jeff.
- Jeff.
- What?
You all right?
Do you think Mom and you
would've gotten back together?
I think so.
I still can't believe she's dead.
Goddammit.
Goddamn dog.
That dog is history.
Goddammit.
You hear me, boy?
Goddammit.
- Don't shoot him.
- What, Drew? What did you say?
Gus. What have you done?
Amanda, stop lookin' at me like that.
He's had ample warnin' about that dog.
Zowie?
I was just going by your house.
Where's your bike?
Zowie's dead.
I have to bury him.
I don't wanna go out there alone.
All right.
I'll go get a shovel, OK?
So, where do you wanna bury him?
I'm not gonna bury him here.
- Then why are we here?
- There's a better place.
It's back there somewhere,
through the bog.
Come on.
It's supposed to be up there.
- What is?
- The old Indian burial ground.
Drew, come on, it's an old bullshit
story. You said so yourself.
But what if it's not bullshit?
If I bury Zowie there,
and it works, he'll come back.
- Alive.
- Drew, look.
I know your dog died, but get a grip.
You're freaking me out.
If there was one chance in a million
it'd work, wouldn't you just wanna try?
Look, let's just get this over with, OK?
If this doesn't work, you can't
ever tell anyone I did this, OK?
You've gotta promise.
Well, you need any help?
You have to bury your own. That's
the way the Indians did it. It's like a rule.
I've never had anyone die before.
But I guess you get over it.
I mean, eventually.
No.
No, you never get over it.
Look, maybe we should get outta here.
Yeah.
So long, Zowie.
Wanna get in?
Your mama's worried sick. Take off in
the night, you don't show up for school.
What are you tryin' to prove?
I'm not trying to prove anything.
I was burying my dog.
Life is full of lessons, buddy.
No one's above 'em. Not you, not me.
Now get in the car.
Zowie?
Drew.
Drew, you unlock this door right now.
- Unlock it, Drew.
- What did I do now?
Open this door, Drew Gilbert.
Where do you come off lyin' like that?
"I'm burying my dog. "
You think a lie like that's
never gonna catch up to you?
Zowie.
You say your goodbyes, mister. Zowie's
goin' outside, and you are grounded.
That's the new law, buddy.
Drew. Honey, I'm gonna call the vet.
Hey, Drew. Jeff,
why don't you give him a hand?
OK. Hey, Zowie.
Let's go up here, pal.
There you go. Lie down.
There you go, boy.
- How'd it happen?
- Some psycho got trigger-happy.
All right, I'm gonna give him a local
anaesthetic so I can clean the wound.
I'd like to take him home
tonight for observation.
Can you keep him at your place
until he gets better?
Yeah. Sure.
Come on.
Listen. Maybe he wasn't dead
when we buried him.
He was dead. You know he was.
Jeff.
Mom.
I'm waiting for you.
Mom.
Is he gonna be OK?
I don't know.
It's been three days. His immune
system should've responded by now.
It's OK.
I'm not gettin' a heartbeat.
He must be so weak
it's just not registering.
Jeff, let's take some blood.
Yeah, there you go.
Good boy.
OK.
Listen, why doesn't
he have a heartbeat?
Maybe it takes a while.
- Happy Halloween, Dr Matthews.
- Guys, take it easy.
- Evening, Gus.
- Evening, Ralph.
- These your girls?
- Sure are.
- Trick or treat.
- Behave yourself.
- Have a good night. Come on, girls.
- Bye.
All right, you go up to
the next one on your own.
OK, wait. No. Just hold still.
Just make sure you're home by ten.
If Gus finds out I let you go...
I will drink his blood.
Don't worry, Mom. I'll be home.
Where is everybody?
Jeff, honey, Mommy's here.
Look at this. Junior here
practically shit his pants.
- Check his shorts.
- Oh, no.
Mommy's here, Jeff.
You gonna run home to Daddy now?
Fuck off.
- What a blast.
- Did you see his face?
- You're home early.
- Just ran outta smokes.
Lucky me.
Where's the boy?
In his room.
Drew?
Goddammit, Amanda.
You want me to be father to that boy,
and every time I lay down the law,
you let him break it. Now, where is he?
- I don't know...
- Where is your son?
- Pet Sematary.
- What?
Pet Sematary.
Yeah. That old Louis was one
sick puppy. Diggin' up little Gage.
Maggots pourin' out of
the dead kid's eyes.
Ellie Creed was the only one that lived.
Then one night she freaks out.
Hacks up the grandparents with an axe.
Police found her lickin'
the brains off the blade.
Threw her in the psycho ward.
All she could say were two words.
Pet Sematary.
Here's the best part.
Two nights ago she escapes.
Man, I hope she doesn't show up here.
Shit, we wouldn't even recognise her.
Not if she was wearin' a costume.
She could be one of us.
- Oh, my God.
- What?
Shit. It's Drew's dad. It's Gus.
He's gonna kick my ass.
You boys better not be drinkin'.
Drew, get your ass out here,
front and centre.
Thanks for screwin' up
our Halloween, dumb shit.
You little shit. Get outta here, Matthews,
this is between me and my boy.
I warned you, buddy.
You broke the law,
now you have to learn the lesson.
Zowie.
No, Zowie, stop.
Drew, call him off.
No, Zowie.
Call your dog.
Drew, call him off.
Is he dead?
Oh, man, Jeff.
We killed him.
Are you sure?
What are we gonna do?
We can bring him back.
We can, can't we?
It worked on Zowie.
All right.
Oh, God.
Drew, do you know what time it is?
Did Gus ever find you?
God, what happened to you?
Nothin' happened, Mom.
We just ditched Gus, that's all.
You been drinkin'?
Drew's mom called hours ago.
The other kids were back by ten.
Where the hell were you boys?
- Just out.
- Just out?
Hold it. I've been lettin' you get away
with a lot these past few weeks,
but I will not stand for crap like this.
I don't care if it's Halloween, it's
a school night. Don't ever do this again.
Dad, listen...
I'm really tired and
I just wanna go to bed.
Go on.
We'll talk about this in the morning.
All right.
Drew.
Drew, buddy.
Lost my keys.
Gus?
Found 'em.
I need a shower.
Honey, I'm sorry about tonight.
Please come to bed.
Cold as ice. You smell bad.
What did you get yourself into?
Oh, my God, Gus, what happened
to the...? Gus, stop it.
What are you doing? Stop it. Don't.
Gus. Let go of me.
What's wrong with you, Gus? Stop it.
Let go of me, Gus!
