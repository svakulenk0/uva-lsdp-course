Shinjuku Station Tokyo
May 26
Tokyo-bound express
now arriving on Track 8.
For your safety, please
stay behind the yellow line.
A one... and a two...
...and a three!
Suicide Circle
Hi, everybody. We're Dessert.
Mail me. Hurry and hit the send key.
Can 't you see? I've waited patiently.
Mail me. To my phone or PC, I'm
ready to tell you that I'm standing by.
Mail me. I want to let you know as
friends go, yours is the best hello.
Mail me. I'm sure you never knew, how I
feel about you, this is real, I need to...
...hear from you right now or I'll die.
I've gotta eat. Want anything?
Yeah I do.
Is the bakery okay?
Sure. Get me a curry roll.
And a drink?
Get coffee.
Okay.
Thanks.
Darn.
We interrupt this program
for a special news bulletin.
Evening.
Oh, hello.
Hey, you won't belive the news.
What?
themselves in front of a train.
No way!
Really!
Studying too hard again?
I'm serious.
Let me out.
Wait, listen to this.
There's mass confusion
here on the the platform.
This is unprecedented.
There you go.
Thanks, leave it open.
Okay.
What's the scene like right now?
All lines have stopped running completely.
No word on their resumption.
Have the victims been identified?
The police are working on it,
but none have been made yet.
We first reported that it
was 50 highschool girls...
...who jumped the tracks.
But we've since learned it
was actually 54 students.
Hello?
Anyone there?
Hello?
Hello?
Ms. Kawaguchi?
Jiro?
You scared me.
Have you seen Akko?
Yes, I have.
She still out?
I guess so.
That's strange. The store is so close.
Yeah, I guess it is.
What's keeping her?
I don't know.
Well whatever.
I'll call you when she returns.
Thanks.
Ms. Kawaguchi?
Ms. Sawada?
Ms. Kawaguchi?
Nurse Kawaguchi?
Yoko Kawaguchi?
What an ordeal that turned out to be.
I think the power's out.
The bakery is closed so I walked all over.
Did Ms. Kawaguchi go home?
I'm beat.
Hey, where's Yoko?
I think she went home.
Oh.
You want her food.
Um... sure.
Here.
Ah, that feels good.
I'll see you later.
What're you doing?
You've still got blood on you.
Your shoes.
Where's Kuroda?
We're all here.
Listen up. This was not a crime.
It's an accident.
Stop looking so glum.
They weren't all from the
same high school, were they?
No, they weren't.
So far we know it's 18 schools.
The connection.
It wasn't a crime.
I'll check it out.
It may have been some sort of cult.
A suicide cult? Ridiculous.
Excuse me.
Phone call.
I'd say it's too much TV, "The Pied Piper."
Shibu here.
It's bothered me for a while.
What has?
You know, the suicides.
Yeah... go on...
You at a computer?
Yes.
I've got a web site for you to look at.
Hold on.
Call everyone.
Go ahead.
www.maru...
.... Ne. Jp
What is this?
The red dots... are women.
The white ones are men.
What's it mean?
I had a hunch when I first saw it...
...but after today, I'm sure of it.
There were 54 new red dots.
There are even more now.
When did you find this?
When did you find this?
Recently. It intrigued me.
After those 4 suicides the other day...
...I saw 4 more dots.
It's a weird site. This is all there is.
Check out the provider.
Tell me what you find,
okay? I'll do the same.
Understood.
And you would be?
The Bat.
No, I mean your real name.
The Bat's fine.
All right, "The Bat" it is.
Do you have a web site?
I post on a BBS a lot,
look for The Bat there.
Gotcha.
www.jikennews.com
Gotta go now.
Wait.
Oh yeah, the dots appear before
the suicides are reported.
Anyway, good luck.
Hello? Hello?
She hung up.
We've got another suicide.
Go talk to the witnesses.
Jesus!
May 27
Yeah, there was a...
Sports bag?
Yes.
It was found on the platform at the time.
Yeah, here it is.
Could you wait outside for a minute?
Why?
Please.
All right. Knock when you are finished.
Same thing.
It may not be the same
person, but it's human skin.
That is certain.
The stitches are the same size.
Identical work.
The skin is stitched 10 centimeters apart.
There's so much of it.
We're looking at an
incredible number of people.
You think they're different people?
We're not sure yet, but we think so.
Each piece is different skin.
It's possible that skin from the same
person is repeated somewhere...
...if it's like the one found yesterday.
So together, it's skin from
about 200 people then?
You could say that... yes.
There are several bodies here.
We'll pry them apart later.
Look here.
We won't know until tomorrow,
but we're sure it's their skin.
So the other 100 or so skin samples...
...could be from living people?
I have no idea... I'd prefer
it be from corpses, though.
We'd have to check a lot of
murder and accident victims.
Most have already been cremated.
The remaining 100 are still to come.
That's totally absurd, impossible.
The Tokyo-bound train
now arriving on Track 8.
For your safety, please
stay behind the yellow line.
See you tomorrow.
Good night.
"No end to rash of suicides!"
"Recent crime scene. Call
if you have information."
Welcome home.
What's with you?
Nothing.
Weirdo.
Toru! Sakura!
Come down here.
What now?
What?
Sit.
What is it?
A family meeting.
You're kidding.
What's up?
Indulge me.
Dessert's on TV.
"Mail me."
Hey, listen up.
What's got into you?
Forget it.
What's "Dessert"?
"Mail me."
May 28
Why do we get the garbage detail?
Let's just dump it on the roof.
This totally sucks.
Maybe, I'll kill myself too.
Really?
Do it with me.
I will if you will.
Question, what did you
think of the suicides?
Freaky, I mean 54 girls! Can you believe it?
Definitely a cult.
Yeah, but why'd they wanna die?
Hey! We're dumping this here, okay?
It's a cult, I say.
I heard there was so much
grease the train couldn't brake.
It slipped on human grease.
Gross!
Hey, let's all kill ourselves.
Yeah! I'm in!
Not me!
The Suicide Club.
Let's get enough people to beat 54.
We'll pass out flyers.
"Join our Suicide Club."
"Come die with us!"
"Let's shed blood together."
But before that, we party.
Lots of food and fornication.
Pervert. Then you'd leave, right?
Hey, you have my word.
It's gotta hurt though.
Let's not do the train thing.
Drug overdose?
I like that.
I could do that.
Hey, you guys!
What?
Come watch me kill myself.
Our newest member.
Watch me, okay?
Count me out.
Suicide club! Suicide club!
Jump! Jump!
I'm dying now.
Natsumi, stop.
Here I go.
You idiot! You have not intention of doing it!
I'll show you for real.
Me, too!
On three okay?
And hold hands.
Okay?
Wow, this is intense!
No shit.
One, two...
Wait, time out!
You serious?
Dead serious. Let's go!
Ready? A one and a two...
Oh my god...
Hey! Stop it!
We gotta do it!
Get away!
Come down from there!
Suicide club.
We're the Suicide Club's founding chapter.
I know it's hard. But if you
could, tell me what you know.
First, it was Machi.
Then Taka...
She said "I'm dying now."
I see.
I didn't think she was serious.
Then the others joined in.
Hey, Kuroda.
We don't seem to have
a sports bag this time.
No, you're right.
Hey.
That.
Scrape that off.
Here comes an ear.
We're going to have to open
a criminal investigation...
...starting with the train suicides.
We can't. These aren't criminals.
I don't know.
Something's going on...
You're paranoid. It's a suicide fad.
They're just highly impressionable kids.
Not a word about a Suicide Club...
...or kids will be dying all over Japan.
May 29
What happened? Call the police!
And an ambulance!
Masa?
Mitsuko?
Why?
Sorry I hit you.
Where'd you jump from?
Why'd you do it, Masa?
Sorry.
But what a perfect coincidence
that I hit you, huh?
You gonna die, Masa?
Yeah, I guess you are.
I have to keep living.
My ear.
Coffee!
You think she's got one too?
Do you think he meant to land on you?
Beats me.
Have you heard of the Suicide Club?
Answer me, please.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Okay.
Did you know about the wound on his back?
Do you have one too?
No.
Didn't you ask him why he
was missing skin there?
No, creep.
If your woman had a bent nose...
...would you ask her why? Boar.
Stay here.
What do you think of Masa?
Your boyfriend.
You won't find anything.
He was just the type.
Pisses me off.
Let him die.
Wait... hold up.
If you think of anything else,
could you call this number?
What was that about?
Nothing.
So what's the story?
About what?
Suicide Club.
There's no such thing.
I found a weird website. Wanna see it?
I can't hear the TV.
Such unappetizing talk.
"Mail me. Hurry and drop me a line."
Shut up!
How old are they?
Average is 14, I think.
Younger than you.
Sakura's immature.
And you?
Me too.
I like the song actually.
Don't blame me.
Kiyoko, your dad's tired.
Kiyoko, it's not my fault, you know.
Good evening. I am The Bat.
I've made it this far.
I believe the source of
all the recent suicides...
...lies somewhere on the Net.
I've come here to find out if I'm right.
I understand the meaning of the dots.
So have I got it all right.
It wasn't easy you know.
If so, please respond. I'll be waiting.
With love...
To my dear Suicide Club.
Watch this.
Ruins. Com.
Yeah, weird, huh?
"Spread this message if you
want to halt the suicides"
"Or more will die. We will all die."
A friend showed it to me.
Is there more?
Nope, that's it.
Gotta be a prank.
Inspection done.
Yes, I'm in!
Dad! Dad! Dad!
Dad, do we dare?
Don't be silly. Move over.
What is it?
"Kuroda"
What are you typing?
Now we wait for a response.
Yeah, hello?
Is Mr. Kuroda there?
Kuroda? He's gone home.
He left early today. Can I help you?
You are?
You okay?
Who are you?
I'm Murata.
When will Kuroda be in?
Tomorrow morning. Who might you be?
There is no Suicide
Club. Just tell him that.
I'll call tomorrow at 8.
Hello? Kuroda?
We're ready.
May 30
You're on.
Hello?
Is this Mr. Kuroda?
This is Kuroda. And you are?
You taping this?
Yes.
Will it be on TV?
That depends on whether you help us.
Are you with a friend?
There are others, yes.
I see. These "others" are they big people?
What do you mean?
Are they adults?
No.
Then I can't promise any TV.
Why not?
Because you're not involved.
Are you involved in yourself?
What? Say again?
I guess you don't understand.
Are you involved?
With what?
The suicides.
You obviously have no idea.
Tonight at 7:30, on the same platform...
...50 more will jump.
Could be girls, could be kids.
Here's a hint, the 6th chain.
It's a prank.
Do we stake it out?
What do you propose we
watch? All males? All females?
The 6th chain...
This is no accident, got it?
It's a crime.
Ome-bound train now arriving.
For your safety, please
stay behind the yellow line.
You girls on your way home?
Yes.
Straight home?
Going home?
Yes, I am.
Kuroda!
Excuse me. Show me your tattoo.
Fuck off.
You got one?
She doesn't, I've seen her naked.
Shut up. Is this a pick up line?
Hey, is that a real tattoo?
You guys have tattoos? No?
Thanks.
You're sloshed, man.
Shibu!
Stop right there!
Police!
Nothing doing.
Wait one more train.
Right.
Those cheap tattoos?
Everyone's got 'em these days.
Takao-bound express now
arriving on Track 10.
For your safety, please
stay behind the yellow line.
One and two...
One and two and three...
Please stand clear of the doors.
That's enough. We're done.
Look, more.
Don't leave to tomorrow
what you can do today.
Japan's too complacent.
I used to shoplift.
We're sinners.
Yes, life is a sin! You just
cause trouble for others.
Kill yourself before you murder someone.
That's the spirit.
Be a spirit.
You order that again?
Do me a favor. Try something
new for a change, will ya?
This is gonna be heavenly.
Delectable.
What is that?
I dunno. Something hot.
Evening folks.
Have you noticed how quickly
fads come and go these days?
I have.
Take cell phones...
"Jump here"
Yum, chocolate. All for me.
Hey, not so fast! Give us some!
We've got our own chocolate bar.
What? You want some?
Okay, go ask your mother.
Mom!
It's rising.
Ropes, ladies.
To the great beyond.
Mom, can I get some chocolate?
Sure, if you're a good girl.
Come here. Dessert's on TV.
Mom's funny.
You hallucinate.
Go kill yourself.
Thank you very much.
If a gentle melody rises to your ears...
...stop the world revolving
and let music swell.
Someday we shall meet again,
so wipe away those tears.
Now it's time to bid you
all a pleasant farewell.
Now it's time to bid you
all a pleasant farewell.
Now it's time to say goodbye.
I hope you all are well.
Everyone's acting funny these days.
We want this song to cheer everybody up.
I'm home.
Welcome home, dad!
I'm exhausted.
Kiyomi! Toru!
"Track 8: Jump here."
Sakura? Sakura!
"Look behind you!"
Metropolitan Police Department
So you thought this was
all a game, eh, Bat Girl?
Reality's a lot simpler.
You lose.
Now type.
Shut the fuck up.
What do you want?
Mail the cops. Tell them
you were kidnapped...
...by the Suicide Club. You can type blind.
"Help me!"
Genesis, we're back.
Welcome to the Suicide Club.
You're guests of my pleasure room.
Now Kiyoko, your glasses are crooked.
Better? Can you see clearly now?
Bad boy! Bad, bad boy!
Sissy.
My chair!
Hammer.
Son of a bitch.
Kiyoko, what do you do in your
free time? You like home repair?
I asked you a question!
There.
Welcome to my pleasure room.
Let's entertain them.
Shut up and listen!
Time and time again the sky is blue.
And yet it's strange how people
seem to always fall in love.
An unfamiliar yellow dog...
...keeps grinning as it tears
us from the ones we love.
Because the dead...
Because the dead...
Because the dead shine all night long.
I want to die as beautifully
as Joan of Arc...
...inside a Bresson film.
Lesson one, apply the shaving cream...
...and smile as you then
slowly slice away the heart.
Because the dead...
Because the dead...
Because the dead shine all night long.
Feel the warmth of the spring rain as
it gently moistens down a cheek...
...that's streaked with dried up tears.
A guileless boy but five years old
stares blankly in the face of death...
...while his heart is cut and torn away.
Kuroda...
The tattoo of the 6th chain.
This isn't suicide. It's murder.
Tell me. Which is murder, and which isn't?
Is it murder starting today?
Or is this a special exception?
It was murder from the start!
It was.
All of it.
I'm so sorry.
It's my fault. I was blind.
Hello?
Yes, okay.
It's for you.
Who is it?
I think it's your son.
Hello, Mr. Kuroda?
Give it to him.
Kuroda here.
Kuroda, hold on.
Hello?
Why'd you do it?
I didn't.
Why?
What's your connection to you?
What?
Good bye.
Wait!
Do you understand? I
understand our connection.
I understand your connection to your wife.
I understand your
connection to your children.
But as for your connection to yourself...
If you die, will you lose the
connection with yourself?
Even if you die, your connection
with your wife will remain.
So will your connection with your children.
But if you die, will you lose
your connection with yourself?
Will you live on? Are you
connected to yourself?
Why couldn't you feel the pain
of others as you would your own?
Why couldn't you bear the pain
of others as you would your own?
You are the criminal.
You could only think of
yourself. You're scum.
Scum!
Kuroda!
Investigate all suicides up until now.
That's an order!
Kuroda!
It's no use.
It's no use.
They're not the enemy.
Kuroda!
This is crazy.
Really crazy.
What does it mean?
Overtime.
Shibu!
What is it?
Get the providers and all links.
You leaving school man?
I blew my finals, so yeah.
Finish high school at least.
Why? You didn't.
True.
I'm starving.
I could go for some red meat.
After a kill, make it rare.
"It's the Bat. Get me out of here!"
Memo.
Here.
Let's go.
What are you doing?
Move aside.
Go ahead, Kiyoko. Type away.
"From what I can tell, I'm in a
dimly-lit basement of some kind."
That won't do. Tell them our address.
Go ahead. We need to stir
up some excitement anyway.
Now's the perfect time to
get caught. Right? Right?
This is where my name
gets etched in history.
Here, let me do that.
Entertain her, will you?
Hi, there. My name's Genesis.
I've had delusions of
grandeur since I was a child.
May 31
Just after 7 this morning...
...the police arrested a group
calling itself The Suicide Club...
...and claiming responsibility
for multiple murders.
The group used the Internet to
call upon people to kill themselves.
Their proclaimed aim was social upheaval.
Investigators are now working
to uncover the details.
Stand back please, move aside.
Am I on camera? Good, good, good.
First I'd like to say reality
is invisible to the naked eye.
You and me both know
that life is a real bitch.
Bring your best you say?
That's not good enough.
It's like that Dessert
song. How's that go again?
"The world is a jigsaw puzzle."
Somewhere there's a fit for you.
Has to fit.
The world is a jigsaw puzzle.
The world is a jigsaw puzzle.
Somewhere there 's a fit for you.
A place where your puzzle piece belongs.
Don 't fit you say? Then make it so.
There 's nowhere for my piece to go.
Find a match that lasts forever.
Perhaps I better say so long.
I'm the Charlie Manson
of the Information Age!
"Find a match that lasts forever."
"Perhaps I'd better say so long."
It's open.
Mitsuko.
I've come to return this.

Suicide.
Please enter your PIN number.
Got it?
Who is this?
There is no Suicide Club you know.
But come on over.
Hello.
Hey Shibu...
...just got word that 200 girls
jumped from Osaka Castle.
I wonder if we got the right guy.
How did he get them to do it?
"Dessert concert tomorrow."
June 2
Even if you were to die...
...your connection to your
boyfriend would remain.
Even if you were to die, your
link to the world would remain.
So why are you living?
Why did you come?
Did you come to repair your
connection with yourself?
Or did you come to sever that connection?
Are you now severed from yourself?
I am I. And I'm connected to myself.
Are you related to you?
Like between you and me,
victim and assailant...
...you and your boyfriend.
Can you relate to yourself?
Are you related to yourself?
Are you sought by yourself?
When rain dries, clouds form.
When rain dries, clouds form.
When clouds moisten, rain forms.
It's ready.
Tokyo-bound express
now arriving on Track 8.
For your safety, please
stay behind the yellow line.
This is Dessert's final performance.
Thanks for all your support.
Our last message to you is...
Live as you please!
Little did we know how
little do we really know.
Everyday we 're pressing the keys...
...that execute a million commands.
If only you would say exactly
what is on your mind...
...and tell me how you really feel.
Maybe I can lend a helping hand.
Scary it's true, but loads of fun too.
To open up and feel the brand of life...
...for each and everyone.
Light yourself with life.
Light yourself with love.
Light yourself with memories.
All it takes is just a little
heart and courage on your part.
Turn yourself around and take
it once again from the start.
Though you may feel out
of touch at times...
...or fear a wicked spell
has got your life in hand.
If by some chance, you share the
feelings that I have for you...
...come occupy the chasm of my heart.
Together we can shed light on the dark.
Scary, it's true. But we 'll be happy too.
Now do you really want to say good bye...
...and leave me high and dry.
Light yourself with life.
Light yourself with love.
Light yourself with memories.
As we go, we 'll forget the
pain. We 'll find life again.
