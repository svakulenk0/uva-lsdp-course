- He's gonna miss his train, Frank.
- Tommy, he'll be here.
I'm sorry you couldn't
come over for dinner.
- What dinner?
- Last night.
Rose talked to Angie about it.
She said you guys were busy.
She never mentioned that.
We were watching TV.
You missed a good dinner, Frank.
I don't know what's wrong
with Angela lately. I gotta talk to her.
Right on time.
Passengers for the train arriving
on track four, please watch your step.
I love you!
- How do these people do it every day?
- It's like fuckin' sardines.
I feel shot right through
with a bolt of blue
It's no problem of mine,
but it's a problem I find
I tell you what, Angela.
It all boils down to good follicles.
Youve been blessed.
One head in a million.
I ran into her at Foodtown.
- I invited her over for dinner.
- Yeah?
But Angela says they're busy.
Then, this morning,
Tommy is talking to Frankie.
- Turns out they were home last night.
- Stop!
Frankie didn't know anything about it.
She never even told her own husband.
Who the hell does she think she is?
Mrs D, you don't like it?
No, no. It's not the cut.
Thanks, Ray.
- Connie!
- Hey, doll! How are you?
Oh, look at you. A redhead!
- You look gorgeous.
- Oh, honey!
- Hey, Angela!
- Hi!
- How you doin', kiddo?
- OK. How you doin'?
You know me. Always lookin for action!
- You look terrific, kid.
- Thanks.
- That Frank better keep an eye on you.
- Yeah, right!
You comin' to the card game tonight?
Come on. We haven't seen you in an age.
No, I gotta help Joey.
He's having a lot of trouble in school.
Of course he is!
He hangs out with Tony Junior.
Face it, these boys will never be Einstein.
Come on over tonight.
No, I really can't.
Listen, I gota go. I'm real sorry.
Have a great time.
It was great to see you guys.
Bye. Take care.
That bitch! She thinks her shit don't stink.
I have three cards.
One red - you can take all my bread -
and two blacks - that'll set you back.
Watch it, chase it, see where I place it.
- It's right here.
- That's it.
Give me five and you win ten.
Aw...
- Gee, I coulda sworn, giris...
- Tough luck, giris. Try again.
Hey! What's goin' on here?
- Hi, Mrs de Marco.
- Hi, Tara.
- Hm?
- Nothing, Ma. Were just playing.
- You playing for money?
- No, we were just playing for fun.
Right, guys?
I want all of youse to go home.
Joseph Francis, I'll talk to you inside.
I'll be right in, Ma.
- Hi, hon.
- Hi, babe.
- Goin out tonight?
- Yeah, Tony called a meeting.
- You playing cards at Connies tonight?
- No. What are you looking for?
No? Why not?
I don't feel like it.
Angela, when the bosss wife
asks you to play cards, you go.
I don't have to jump every time
Connie or Tony snaps their fingers.
I don't know what's wrong with you lately.
All the other guys, their wives get along.
Tommy and Rose invite us to dinner.
You lie to them.
They used to be your friends.
Now you can't stand them?
That makes me look bad.
How am I to get ahead in the family?
Same way you always have.
Lie, cheat, steal, kill.
Very funny. Youre a comedian now, huh?
- Mom, I have to go to the bathroom.
- Hey, hey.
Come here. I do not want you takin
money from those kids any more.
- It was Tony Juniors idea!
- Oh! What, that makes it OK?
- You playing three-card monte again?
- Yeah.
- How much you take from them?
- 12 bucks.
- Not bad.
- Thanks, Dad.
Thanks, Frankie.
I'm trying to teach him something.
He's only a kid.
- What are you looking for?
- My revolver. Where is my revolver?
- Here, Dad.
- Joey, give me that!
- Go to your room, Joey.
- Come on, Lucky!
Thank you, Joey.
That's great, Frank. That's really great.
It's not loaded, Angela.
- I can't believe it.
- I'll keep it locked up from now on.
It's not just the gun, Frank. It's everything.
It's this whole life.
Your life is so bad?
You have a beautiful house,
plenty of money, a great kid,
a husband who loves you.
What more do you want?
I want a normal life. I'm sick and tired
of the gambling, the guns,
bailing you outa jail, never knowing
when or if you're gonna come home.
Look at this place! Everything we wear,
everything we own, fell of a truck!
Sh! Take it easy, baby.
I don't think you're making much sense.
When I look at this house, I see
a swell house with beautiful furnishings.
When I go up in Joeys room,
I see all the things we give him.
Things you and I never had
when we was growin up.
Frankie, don't you get it?
Everything has blood on it.
I don't have to sit here
and listen to this garbage!
- Neither do I!
- No?
- No!
- No? What are you gonna do about it?
- I want a divorce!
-
Listen to Dr de Marco
for just a second, darling, all right?
You go upstairs, you take a Valium.
You lie down, relax.
You'll feel a lot beter. All right, darling?
What have we here?
It's Nick The Snake and
his two nephews, Al The Worm and...
Dont tell me. Vinnie The Slug.
Your common, garden-variety hoodlums.
Ah! And speak of the devil,
Cucumber Frank de Marco.
Bang!
The gangs all here, Mike.
Everyone except Tony The Tiger Russo.
I tried to play all the keys...
Hey, heres Tony

He's Tony The Tiger
- Excuse me, Mr Russo.

Hey, fellas!
Butch. Nick.
Tom? Some glasses
and an order for you.
Frank.
Yeah.
- Hows Angela and the kid?
- They're both very good. Thank you.
- Ive got something for you here.
- Oh, thanks very much, Tony.
That was a great job
that you did on the train.
Well, it was a beautiful ride, Tony.
Go take care of the guys upstairs.
I'll be right up.
The same
The same melody
Somebody tell me
what's been happening to me lately
Tell me what the heck is goin wrong
- Table for two, gentlemen?
- Yeah.
This way, please.
- My God, Tony! It's beautiful.
- Youre beautiful.
I am gonna have to do something
very special for you tonight.
You twisted my arm. The Fantasia.
- Our old room. 17.
- Room 17.
- Uh, duh... Twelve past ten.
- Ten past.
Yeah, ten past twelve.
- 2am. Quitin time.
- All right.
But you did miss a good dinner,
to tell you the truth.
- You know Rosies chicken francese?
- With the ricota?
Correct.
Shells with sauce.
With cannoli afterwards.
- What, are you stayin?
- Yeah, I'm gonna take a bath before I go.
Is... somethin wrong, Tone?
Yeah.
You shouldnt smoke in bed.
Youre gonna start a fire.
OK, I gota go. Gimme a kiss.
Oh... Thanks.
Forget about it.
You go straight home now, lollipop.
Hmm...
Frank?
Frank, you're early!
Put this over there.
Karen?
Karen?
Save me some soap, Karen,
because I'm feeling extra dirty tonight.
Tony, I had no idea
you was putin the stones to Karen.
It's checkout time, Frankie.
Oh, Tony, this blows my mind!
- I loved you like a father.
- You disappointed the shit out of me.
Go away.
Downey.
I'm there.
- Special Agent Downey, FBI.
- Let him by.
Yesterday The Fat Man buys a one-way
ticket on the Long Island railroad.
Cucumber Frank de Marco takes a bath.
It looks like payback time.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
The place is clean.
I don't know, sir. Doesnt add up.
You got a beter make on it?
The late Karen Lutnick
was Tony Russos girlfriend.
No shit.
Maybe Frank was indiscreet. They don't
call him The Cucumber for nothing.
Karen was a real dish.
Tony finds out Franks eating of his plate.
Tonys got a temper.
A man gets angry, he gets sloppy.
Maybe The Tiger did it himself.
- That's murder one.
- Two counts. We could hang him.
Put me back on 24-hour surveillance.
I'll nail Tony for the murders
of Frank de Marco and Karen Lutnick.
Let us pray for our brother
to our Lord Jesus Christ, who said:
I am the resurrection and the life.
The man who believes in me
will live even if he dies.
Frank... My baby...
- We know that he will raise up...
- Such a good boy.
We commend our brother to the Lord.
May the Lord receive him into his peace
and raise up his body
on the last day. Amen.
- Frank! I'm coming with you!
- Mama!
Mama, no! Mama!
They found them in the tub... naked.
- What goes around comes around.
- Here she comes.
- Youse don't have to clean up.
- Angela, sh! Just be quiet, OK?
- Thanks, you guys. I appreciate this.
- What are friends for?
And we are your friends, Angela,
whether you like it or not.
I'm, um... I'm gonna go
check on my mother-in-law.
Poor kid.
She's been through a lot.
- You liar!
- No, it's true!
- Liar!
- No, it's true!
Hey! The two of youse knock it of!
All right, stop this fight! What is this?
Tony, get up. Get of. Get up!
Get in the house. Go on, hurry up!
- You all right, Joey?
- My nose is bleeding.
Let me see that.
That's nothing. That's nothing.
- Are you OK?
- Mm.
You two just stay away
from each other today, OK?
Go on.
Thank you so much, Tony.
Thank you so much.
So, Angela... How are you?
How are you holdin up, huh?
I don't know... I'm...
Yeah, I'm OK. I'm OK. Yeah.
Now, look...
I wanna reassure you, Angela.
Youre not gonna be alone.
I'm gonna take care of you.
I really appreciate that, Tony.
I really do, but...
Angela...
I wanna help you.
Oh, you're so sweet.
Thanks.
Oh, Angela...
Holy shit! The grieving widow!
Keep your hands of me.

You worried about your figure?
- Some of us are.
- Cute.
Joan Rivers Junior, huh?
You know, Angela,
sometimes when a girl gets single,
she starts thinking about
goin out with other giris guys.
Connie, I am not interested in Tony.
Everybody is interested in Tony.
You beter call it of, because
if I ever catch you two together...
I... I...
Just forget about it!
Try keepin Tony on a leash!
I think you'll find one in aisle 5!
Oh, yeah? While I'm there,
I'll pick you up a flea collar!
Angela, watch your ass!
- Will that be spiced or regular?
- Spiced.
OK. Comin right up.
Die! Die, earthling!
Joey...
- Where did you get that?
- Uncle Tony gave it to me.
- Uncle Tony?
- He gave me this, too. A $100 bill!
- He bought some stuf for you, too!
- Oh, yeah?
Ta-da!
Die!
Joey, stop it!
What's the mater, Ma?
Joey...
Tony is not your uncle. He's not a relative.
And I don't want you
taking presents from him any more.
Can I keep the Lazer Tag stuf?
No. Sorry.
Run upstairs and do your homework.
OK.
Because I care.
- Your receipts, Mrs de Marco.
- Mm-hm, mm-hm.
Your generosity is overwhelming.
Here - the pink slip to the car, and
the address where to pick it up tonight.
God bless you, Mrs de Marco.
Forget about it. Oh, after tonight...

What? Cucumber Frank de Marcos
widow is screwing Tony Russo?
- That's what Tonys wife thinks.
- I don't get it. How does Connie fit in?
From my observation, sir, Connie is
the one person who Tony actively fears.
Who knows why,
but it borders on the pathological.
Subject married
Francis Aloysius de Marco, May 15, 1979.
The key is Angela de Marco.
I say we tap her phone, her house,
her bedroom. Stake her out.
Scope her, tail her, coming and going,

- Beats me.
Tony, it's in a hell of a place.
I wouldnt have a dog live there.

Hi! Can I help you with something?
I'm not sure you're the person

Youve got to get here really early.
I'm just a travelling stranger
On my way...

Friday night sounds great.

Some detective!
Mike, this is my son Joey.
- Hiya, Joey.
- Hi.
Mom, did the cavemen
kill all the dinosaurs?
Gee, hon... I don't know.
It's... a litle before my time.
Actually, Joey,
the dinosaurs were dead millions
of years before humans showed up.
In fact, if the worid were 24 hours old,
the dinosaurs would
have lived in the last hour,
and the humans would have lived
less than two seconds of that 24th hour.
Mike, you blow my mind.
Hey, big guy,
have you started your homework?
- No.
- I didn't think so.
Why don't you run down and start your
homework? I'll be down in a few minutes.
Youre really good with kids. Do you
have any? Youre not married, are you?
Angela, if I were married,
would I accept a date with you?
No, I guess not. Neither am I.
Well, I was, but he's dead.
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, no. Dont be.
Well, I'll get outa your hair.
- So, uh, I'll see you Friday night.
- See you there.
- OK. About eight?
- Eight o'clock.
OK.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Prety wild, huh?
- It's very nice.
This is some kind of punch.
I can't pronounce the name.
What shall we toast?
Oh, I know. Here's to elevators.
You meet the nicest people in them.
So where to?
- Well, I could use a little snack.
- The usual?
You read my mind.
Tell the boys behind us.
All right.
Hello.
- Are you hungry, boys?
- I thought you'd never ask.
Good. Were going to Burger Worid.

Drive up to the clown

one of these nerves in here...
Ooh! Ow!
Oh, God...
Oh...
Oh, God! Dont stop. That feels great.
I can't remember the last time
a man touched me below the waist.

-
Mike, I'm sorry...
- Whoa!
-
- Hey!
- Oh, God!

- Oh, yeah?
What do you call these?
- Glasses?
- I'll remember you said that!
Your hair looks like shit!
- Please...
- I'm here, Tony!
Connie, you're making a big mistake.
Tony!
See?
This is my neighbour Mike.
This is my friend... Connie.
Whose husband are you, dorkface?
Gee, I, uh, don't know.
Whose husband are you lookin for?
- Mine.
- Oh.
- I guess I got you on the wrong night.
- Get out! And stay out of my life!
Look, I fight for what's mine.
I make no apologies.
You can call me a ball-buster,
but it's just the way I am!
Keep away from Tony!
You all right?
It doesn't mater.
What the hell was I thinkin?
I'm such a jerk.
I thought I could start a new life.
Gave away everything we had.
Cut all our ties to the past.
Dragged Joey away from all his friends.
Be good - look where it got us.
All for nothing.
We'll never get away from them.
And the funniest part of all...
I wasn't even thinkin' of guys,
and then I meet you and...
If you knew what I...
what I thought about us and...
That's prety pathetic.
I mean, let's face it.
They're never gonna leave me alone.
The ball-buster...
is Mrs Tony Russo.
Recognise the name?
The Russo crime family?
Well, my husband worked for Tony.
And he was iced.
And Tonys been trying
to screw me ever since.
So... God, I hate them.
Um...
Jeez...
I really, uh... misjudged you.
I'm sorry.
It was nice knowing you.
Bye.
Angela.
I, uh...
Hey.
- Ive got some things I have to say to you.
- You do, huh?
Goddamn it!
It's not easy to turn your life around.
Especially when your past
keeps coming back to haunt you.
What makes you so smart?
Well, I, uh... guess I know you
beter than you think I do.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
We all make mistakes.
The important thing is to realise it
and to do something about it.
And to let yourself of the hook,
because everybody
deserves a second chance.
They do?
Especially someone like you.
That's the nicest thing
anyones ever said to me.
- Let's go, Mike!
Open up, Romeo!
- Whos that?
- That's my... friend. I gota get to work.

Negative. We treed the wrong possum.
Angela's innocent.
I don't know about you any more,
Downey. I just don't know.
Your brains on hold.
Youre thinking with your dick.
Maybe you're burned out. Fried.
In over your head.
Maybe you need a vacation.
Maybe not.
I don't know, Downey.
I just don't... know.
Three words, gentlemen: Get Tony Russo.
You got it. OK, bye-bye.

Mike, what are you doing here?
Angela, you'd, uh... beter sit down.
Mrs de Marco,
I'm Regional Director Franklin.
This is Special Agent Benitez.
You already know Special Agent Downey.
Downey?
Youre FBI?
Weve had you
under surveillance for some time.
Surveillance? Is that what you call it?
Surveillance for what?
- For starters, traficking in stolen goods.
- What are you talking about?
You donated quite a bit of furniture
to charity. Very generous.
- Unfortunately, most of it was hot.
- Oh... Gimme a break!
That's three to five years, Angela.
I also have a report from the IRS.
Something about undeclared income
and defrauding the government.
That's an additional 10 to 15
in a federal pen.
- Frankie always took care of the taxes.
- You signed the returns.
Then theres the mater of your husbands
death. We know who killed him.
Tony?
And we know who helped.
What is this? Where did you get this?
Youre in deep shit, Angela.
And sos your friend.
She's being deported.
She'll be under a palm tree
opening coconuts by the end of the week.
You sleazy sons of bitches.
- Unless you play ball.
- You people work just like the Mob!
- Theres no diference!
- Theres a big diference, Mrs de Marco.
The Mob is run by murdering,
lying, cheating psychopaths.
We work for the President
of the United States of America.
- Go to hell.
- Let's stop playing games, Angela.
We can have you arrested and put in jail.
You'll be declared an unfit mother,
and Joey will end up in a foster home.
- Hold it, Franklin!
- Shut up, Downey!
- You can't... you can't do that.
- Just you watch us.
The meeting is all set.
Everyone is gonna be there.
I'm havin' a travel agent
bring over the tickets.
I'm handling the security myself.
I don't see any problems.
That's real good, Uncle Joe.
Oh, by the way, theres a, uh...
Mrs de Marco waitin to see you.

Well, look what the cat dragged in.

Yeah, first it was Frankie,
and now Tommy.
Hows Rosie taking it?
Rosie took a months supply of Valium
this morning. She's at Mercy Hospital.
Oh, God...
Yeah. I know.
Um...
I don't know. When I saw
the newspaper this morning,
all these feelings came over me and...
You know, I just...
I just feel really lost and...
well, you know, I just, uh...
I wanted to see you.
Get outa here.
You really scared me
the day of the funeral.
You don't realise the efect
you have on a woman.
Youre a very powerful guy, Tony.
Dont bullshit me, Angela.
You don't get it, do you?
Well, I didn't expect you to.
- I'll see you around.
- Hold it right there.
What?
Are you bein straight with me?
No, I came all the way out here
just to pull your chain.
Well, you know something?
I almost believe you.

- You forgot to say goodbye to me, baby!
- Oh! You were fast asleep.

Baby, I know Ive been hard on you lately,
but I had this awful dream,
and I realised Ive been awfully selfish.
Nah, come on...
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
Eastern Airlines flight 17,
nonstop to Miami, is now boarding

- Please forgive me, baby!
- Dont be silly, Connie.
No, no. Ive got a confessión to make.
Angela! Come on.
The other night when you didn't come
home on time, I got a litle suspicious.
- I'm so ashamed. I went to Angela's.
- You went to Angela's?
I couldn't help it, baby.
I had to see if you were with her.
Just thinkin about you with that slut,
I just... I got... I went crazy!
I couldn't stand it!
Tony, if I had found you
banging that broad,
I woulda hunted you down like an animal.
It would have been slow and painful.
You would have begged me
for mercy, baby.
- I was so far gone...
- Connie...
Youre talkin crazy.
I gota get on the plane.
The point is, I'm so ashamed, baby, for
not trusting you, is what I'm trying to say.
Especially when I saw
the schmuck Angela was with!
- What schmuck?
- Just some schmuck!
Come on. Get on your plane.
Boy, she didn't waste any time, did she?
- Get on the plane, you maniac!
- Yeah, OK.
Tone! I'm gonna be the best wife to you.
OK, honey. See you.
OK. Bye-bye.

I hope that didn't shake you up
too much back there.

Beautiful again. This is Mrs Russo.
I'm gonna join my husband.

But I think it's geting a litle out of hand.
You beter stay out of this, miss.
Check out this here.
- Who the fuck are you?

Be careful. Very, very careful.
- Dont!
- OK. OK. OK.
Angela, you're a very excitin woman.
For some crazy reason, I think
I'd rather kill myself than hurt you.
- But suicides out of the question.
- Oh, yeah?
Just like you hurt my husband? Just like
you killed Frankie, you lying bastard?
Boss, is that bitch tellin the truth?
- Chill out. Chill out!
- That's right, buddies.
Tell em, Tony! Say it loud and clear

The whole place is bugged.
The chairs, the lamps, the paintings!
Any second now, 50 agents
are gonna pound at that door!
- Ah, bullshit.
-
That's it, Tony.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say
can and will be used against you.
- Shut the fuck up, fuzzball!

- You have the right to an atorney.
Angela, stay...!
Get your dicks out of your hands, guys!
If you cannot aford an atorney...

Agh! Connie!
Con?
Oh, my God! Tony, it's Connie!
Why are you here, dorkface?

Honeymoon suite...
Connie, look. She gave me a ring, see?
But it's got a bug in it, Connie. A bug! Can
you believe that? How about that shit?
I got nothin to live for any more, Tone.
Of course you do. That's ridiculous.
Think of Tony Junior!
All your credit cards, honey...
All right, Connie. Let's think.
You got your game shows, honey!
Agh!
Connie, that was... that was close.
Watch your back, Uncle Nick!
Take him out!
You...
Gee, Mike. You didn't have to do that.

You certainly will.
FBI! Drop it, Connie!
- Hold it, Tony!
- Screw you!
- Fuck!
- Tony Russo,
you're under arrest for the murders
of Frank de Marco and Karen Lutnick.
You'll never make it stick.
- Sure, Tony.
- Come on, boys.
- Tony, what did you tell them?
- I'm sorry. I can't talk about it.
- How are the Feds treatin you?
- Not bad. I get to watch all my soaps.
The food must be good.
You put on some weight.
- It's probably the bulletproof vest.
-
Are you afraid someone
will knock you of?
Afraid? With these gorillas around me,
I feel safer than a virgin
at a eunuch convention.
Say, Robert. Excuse me. Would you mind
if I stepped in and took a leak?
- Go ahead.
- Youre a gentleman.
Oh, the fries are crispy,
the shakes are creamy
The Double Continental
with cheese is dreamy
It's a Burger Worid town
Hiya, Tone.
Connie?
Kiss it goodbye!
No...
Holy Mary, mother of God!
Oh, shit!
- Another bad dream, huh?
- Uh, yeah. I guess you could say that.
Time to get up anyway.
Todays your big day.
Cant keep the grand jury waitin.
Angela, you are an artist!
- Great. You like it?
- I love it.
Here. You keep the change on this, OK?
- Thank you.
- Youre welcome.
Next victim!
- Hello, Gorgeous.
- 'Hello, gorgeous. 'Hi.
- Oh, it's you.
- Listen, please don't hang up again.
Angela, look out the window.
Look across the street.
- Give me a break. What do you want?
- Uh... A haircut?
- Boy, you don't give up too easy, Mike.
- Not when it come to you, Angela.
Sure. I suppose I could squeeze you in.
I see your arm is all healed. Lay back.
OK.
Uh...
You know, Angela... Ive been thinking...
Mm. Well, there you go.
Workin without tools again.
You know, Ive been thinking, too.
You know...
I fell for you like a ton of bricks.
I bared my soul to you.
I trusted you. You lied to me.
Then... you almost had me killed.
But...
I can't stop thinkin' about...
what you said to me
that night at my apartment.
Maybe everyone does
deserve a second chance.
Ow!
Even you.
You want one?
Yeah. I want one.
I'll think about it.
