"The current spell of icy weather
has claimed its first victim.
A motorcyclist froze to death
on Highway 4
and drove for a further 90 km
after he was dead.
Two patrolmen flagged him down
and as he didn't react
they pursued him.
They drove alongside
and rebuked him for his attitude.
As he didn't move
they realized something was wrong."
It seems incredible.
It's a wonderful image.
A dead young man drives
his motorcycle across the icy plain,
escorted by two patrolmen.
Where was he going
in that icy dawn?
To see someone who couldn't wait
until the morning.
There's a story here!
I'll cut it out and keep it,
it might inspire me.
I'll get it.
Hello.
Hello. What is it?
I'm an actor.
I'm looking for Enrique Goded.
He isn't here.
But I can see him, man.
In any case,
we don't have any projects, so...
I'd like to speak to him.
We were old pals at school.
I'm Ignacio Rodríguez.
All right, come in.
Thank you.
I don't think he'll see you.
That's all right.
Wait a minute.
He's an actor, a nuisance!
I told him
we aren't preparing a film now.
Tell him I'm not in.
I did, but he saw you.
And I can see him.
He said he was
a friend of yours at school.
Who can he be?
Ignacio Rodríguez.
¿lgnacio?
It can't be!
That's what he said.
Ignacio, is it really you?
Of course, Enrique!
I'm delighted you remember me!
How could I forget you?
Well, it's been sixteen years.
That long?
More or less.
I wouldn't recognize you
with that beard.
You'd look better without it.
Come into my office.
You want a coffee?
No, thanks.
I'm having one.
Then, yes.
Martín, will you make some coffee?
Yes.
Sit down.
What brings you here?
I came to ask for work.
I'm an actor.
I've brought you my resume.
Bumblebee Group.
An independent theater company.
"El Retablillo de San Cristóbal"
by García Lorca,
"The Diary of Adam and Eve"
by Mark Twain...
Mark Twain, García Lorca...
Only the best
for the Bumblebee.
Don't you write anymore?
No, I stopped ages ago.
But I've brought my last story.
"The Visit"
By the way, when are you starting
your next film?
Well...
I'll do anything.
We're eyeing tabloids
to see if I can think of stories.
You've caught me
in a creative crisis.
That's a bummer!
Read my story,
it might give you some ideas.
What's it about?
Our school.
One part is based
on our childhood,
and the other part isn't,
when the characters grow up.
That's fiction.
I haven't introduced you.
Ignacio, Martín.
Pleased to meet you.
Sugar and milk?
Yes, please.
By the way,
I don't call myself Ignacio anymore.
I'm Ángel.
Why's that?
It's my stage name.
An actor can't be called
Ignacio Rodríguez.
He can't?
Of course not.
Ángel Andrade.
Everyone calls me that,
even my mother.
That's great.
Thank you.
Ignacio was..
Ángel.
Ignacio...
Ángel.
Well, Ignacio,
before he became Ángel,
was...
is an old school friend.
Martín is my production director.
and maid of all work.
Well, Ignacio...
Ángel...
Right, Ángel.
I'm delighted to see you.
AS soon as I've got anything...
Give me your number,
I'll call you.
I don't have a phone,
but I'll call you.
Should I leave you another photo?
No, don't worry.
Well, Ángel,
it was great seeing you.
So should I go?
Yes, I think so.
Can't I help you cut out... ?
No, thanks a lot.
So long.
My pleasure.
You look great!
So do you.
Do read "The Visit"
Yes, I will.
I'm dying of curiosity.
Great. See you.
I thought he'd never leave!
Is he really a friend of yours?
Yes.
I haven't seen him
since school.
We were really close.
Well, he was my first love.
But he's changed a lot.
I didn't recognize him.
Will you see him again?
No.
It seemed that you liked him.
No, there's nothing less erotic
than an actor looking for work.
"The Visit".
Ever since we started touring
with the show "The Bomb"
Today we're playing in the town
where I went to school.
I won't mention its name
so as not to promote it.
I owe my best memories
to the Olympo Cinema,
Card.
I'm fucking sick of losing!
Then clear off.
Take a break.
Thank you.
She defines herself as
a mix of desert, hazard,
and cafeteria.
She's a great artiste
and a great friend of mine.
With all of you,
our next act,
the mystery
and the fascination
of the one and only,
the inimitable,
Zahara!
A bit of applause
for Crissake!
So...
What?
Listen...
I'll see you at the hostel.
Yeah, but...
Paquito, you heard me.
You've got time
for everything, fag.
Monda!
Wait for me, love!
Hello.
Hello.
What's wrong?
I can't find my keys.
May I help you?
Sure.
No, they're not here.
Let's see.
Not here either.
No?
No.
Here they are!
My lips are wearing out!
I drank too much.
You're telling me.
Hey!
I'm sucking your dick!
He's out cold!
A kid.
Not a cent.
A lottery ticket.
I'll keep that.
Don't start the engine
right outside.
But he's passed out!
Well hung, isn't he?
He's not bad.
And look, he's still hard!
Love,
let me suck him off a bit.
No, you've got things to do.
You've been at him for hours.
Look at your lip!
Come on,
the bike won't run away.
Shut up!
Now, go hide the bike.
Hurry back, I'll see you
in your room before 7:00.
Sure, I get all the dirty work
and you have all the fun.
Now you get a hard-on,
asshole!
It's not fair!
Enrique Serrano!
Enrique!
Paquito!
Come up here!
What about the bike?
Leave it there.
Come up.
There's nothing like
loading up on drugs
and hormones
to end up
as crazy as you, bitch.
The keys!
We're not stealing the bike!
Why not?
We've got a buyer.
I'll explain later.
I'll meet you at the mass.
So we're going to the school?
yes, now more than ever.
I'm flipping out, bitch!
I bet you are.
Dear Enrique,
It's me, Ignacio.
I've dreamed so much
of this moment!
Years have gone by
but I've never forgotten you.
We have to meet again,
but when you're not drunk.
I want to tell you about my life
and hear about yours
while we eat a cream cake
in the Mallol Patisserie,
like when we got out of school
on weekends.
I'm not going
to complicate your life.
I know you're married
and have a child.
I know that
you live in the next town,
that you're broke
and that I'd like to help you.
Right now,
I'm working on something,
but i'll explain it all
in the patisserie.
Yes?
Have you unpacked
all the boxes?
Not even half of them.
Do you need a hand?
I don't mind, really.
It's best if you don't, Martín.
Thanks.
Can I call you later?
I'm reading.
Don't be so fucking touchy!
I'll call you in a while.
We saw Sara's first films here.
And "Breakfast at Tiffany's".
Enrique and I groped each other
for the first time here.
My knees are trembling
just thinking about it.
I'm meeting him at 6:00
in the patisserie.
Don't get your hopes up.
Remember, he's married.
If Father Manolo
hadn't separated us...
What's he got to do with it?
A lot, everything!
That priest owes me a lot
and it's time for him to pay.
I hate seeing you like this.
You got anything left?
Yes.
What?
Cocaine.
C'mon, let's have some!
Here?
Of course.
No one's out
in the streets yet.
Oh, fag!
Come on.
A nailful for my gal Paca.
One more.
I believe in couples.
two fucks, two bumps,
two "amigas"
"Two Rode Together",
"Two For The Road".
You're such a pig!
Right, let's go to school!
Gee up, girl!
Come on, best foot forward.
This was my school.
I'm worn out.
Do you have anything left?
Be quiet.
It has started.
The god of hope who,
by the grace of the Holy Spirit,
fills us with His joy and peace...
That's Father Manolo.
He looks so old!
Well he's no chicken.
I guess.
Zahara, this is crazy!
Are you backing out, bitch?
No, but the chapel is so tiny,
there's no place to hide.
When he sees us appear,
he'll do what Christ did
to the buyers in the temple.
He drove them out with a whip,
and he was Christ!
So this man who, according
to you, is so imperfect...
I confess to God,
the Father Almighty,
and to you, my brethren,
that I have sinned
through thought, word,
deed and omission.
Through my fault.
Through your fault.
Through my fault.
Through your fault.
Through my most grievous fault.
So I beseech
the Blessed Mary, ever virgin,
the angels, the saints,
and you, my brethren,
to intercede for me
before Our Lord God.
Almighty God,
have mercy on us,
forgive us our sins
and lead us to eternal life.
Through Jesus Christ Our Lord.
We'll see...
The Lord be with you.
I could use Him.
May the blessing
of Almighty God,
Father, Son and Holy Spirit
descend upon you.
You may go in peace.
I hope so.
Go back to the dormitory
and sleep a bit more.
Thank you, Father.
If I'm in the sacristy
for too long, don't wait.
We'll meet at the hostel
for lunch,
sweetheart.
Cute!
Divine!
Good morning, Father Manolo.
What do you want?
You can't come in here!
I'm the sister of an ex-pupil,
Ignacio Rodríguez.
You still can't come in here!
Don't you remember Ignacio?
We've had a lot of pupils.
But no one like Ignacio,
I'm sure.
I've brought
an important message from him.
He can give it to me himself.
He can't.
He died in an accident.
I'm sorry.
Now, please go.
Go away!
Hide!
I've got it all!
Hide, he's coming!
Ignacio...
I told you to leave!
What are you doing here?
The same as you,
remembering Ignacio.
Get out!
We have to talk, Father.
It'll only take a minute.
Say what you have to say
and go!
Are we going to talk in the dark?
I don't mind.
I'm used to working
in the dark.
What do you want?
A better life
and a better body.
What do I have to do
with those improvements?
You can help me
finance them.
I don't believe
Ignacio is dead
or that you're his sister.
I don't even believe
you're a woman.
Are you locking me in?
I don't want anyone
coming in by mistake.
And now,
tell me why you're here!
Ok. I'll get to the point.
It's a story by Ignacio.
Yes, he took your advice
and kept on writing.
I've got a friend,
a pig,
who works at "Diario 16".
He's very interested
in publishing this story.
But first I'd like your opinion.
Apart from being
Ignacio's literature teacher
you're one of the main characters
in this story.
Read this.
Each month, the boys
who got on the honors board,
that is, the ones who got
the best grades,
were rewarded
with a day in the country.
We were always accompanied
by our literature teacher,
my God,
and good and ill.
No!
lgnacio!
lgnacio!
A trickle of blood
divided my forehead in two.
I had a feeling the same thing
would happen with my life.
It would always be divided
and I couldn't help it.
Open the door, Father.
It is I.
What is it?
There's been a robbery.
Where?
In the chapel.
I think it was
after your mass.
Were you missing anything?
No.
The chalice, the paten,
the jug, the cruets...
They must be found!
The boys mustn't hear about this.
Very well.
And no one is to bother me,
except you.
Was that Father José?
Ignacio hated him.
Does he still hit the pupils?
He never lad a hand on Ignacio.
That was
the principal's privilege.
To sum up,
I want a million in cash.
Or else "Diario 16"
will publish the whole story.
I don't have a million pesetas,
much less in cash.
But you can get it.
Now, if you don't mind,
I'm leaving.
I've said all I had to say.
But keep reading,
it gets better.
The key.
Wait.
Wait until after break time.
It'll just be a minute.
So you came to blackmail me.
Tell Ignacio he's overrating
these pages. They're garbage!
Garbage is hot!
You and I make
a best-selling couple.
And the editor of "Diario 16"
knows that.
You're in no position
to threaten anyone.
People will believe me,
not you.
No, people have changed.
This is 1977.
This society puts my freedom
above your hypocrisy.
If we treated Ignacio so badly,
why did he come back?
Why didn't he report us
or change schools?
He came back
'cause he'd fallen in love,
with a classmate.
Enrique Serrano.
Remember him?
Yes.
Do you mind if I keep reading?
There were lots of celebrations
at school.
The most important one
was Principal's Day.
That day, there were
sports competitions
and religious acts,
and we had a special meal.
Come with me, Ignacio.
Come along!
I haven't finished.
You'll sing better that way.
Do you know the new words?
Yes, I've got the crib
Father Manolo gave me.
Call him Reverend Principal.
He's the school principal
from today.
I know.
Don't answer back.
When you're singing,
keep looking at him,
as if there were no one else
in the dining room.
Do you understand?
Yes.
Father José, placed me
in the center of the dining room.
I felt odd in front of
all those priests drinking and eating,
but they all looked at me kindly,
except Father Manolo,
one of your favorite songs.
"Torna A Sorrento".
The new words, "Gardener",
were written by Father José Manuel,
helped by my humble self.
When you're ready, Ignacio.
night and day
among your flowers,
with your eyes
turned up to heaven
with their corollas
burning brightly
and embalm you
with their scent.
I thought you didn't like me.
No, just the opposite!
But every time I looked at you,
you looked away.
Because you made me nervous.
And now I don't?
No.
Has the world
changed me so much?
Sara is so beautiful!
No.
Who can remember if I did something
I shouldn't have?
It is not God
who rejects you.
What's wrong?
I can't sleep.
Neither can I.
What we did in the cinema
wasn't right.
I liked it.
So did I.
But I think it was a sin,
and God's going to punish us.
God?
I don't believe in God.
What do you believe in?
I'm a hedonist.
What's that?
People who like having fun.
I read it in an encyclopedia.
What's the matter?
You hear that?
Father Manolo!
Open the door!
Or must I break it down
and let the whole school
know what you're doing?
lgnacio!
I know you're in there!
I've seen your feet.
I can hear you breathing.
lgnacio!
We're not doing anything!
Get out!
I'll deal with you later!
I'm not leaving Ignacio
alone with you.
How dare you!
Get out of here immediately!
Enrique, please.
Do as he says.
Come here.
What were you doing in there?
Nothing.
Nothing?
I swear, Father.
Then why was the door locked?
Come along.
Come with me to the chapel.
The bell!
What are you thinking of?
I think I've just lost my faith
at this moment,
so I no longer believe
in God or hell.
As I don't believe in hell
I'm not afraid,
and without fear
I'm capable of anything.
We'll forget this, Ignacio.
Even if I wanted to,
I can't stay angry with you.
But promise that what happened
tonight won't happen again.
And Enrique?
What about him?
Will he be punished?
I should expel him!
I'm sure he was
responsible for it all.
No, I was.
Don't cry.
He's a very bad influence on you.
I want what's best for you.
If you don't expel him
I'll do what you want.
Hush.
I sold myself for the first time
in that sacristy
to avoid Enrique
being expelled.
I swore that one day
I'd make him pay for that.
On your feet!
Hands behind your head!
And, one!
Change!
Change!
Change!
Change!
Change!
Change!
Hurry up, Enrique!
We'll miss the bus!
Change!
Change!
I'm happy you came!
You're better without the beard.
Thank you.
What are you doing?
I'm re-reading your story.
Didn't you like it the first time?
Of course.
Just look at it.
I couldn't help making notes.
Force of habit.
That's Ok,
it's your copy.
Thanks.
Right, well...
How can I put this?
I think there's a good film
in this story
and I'd like to direct it.
Really?
You're not kidding me?
I never joke about work.
But first, tell me how much
you want for the rights?
What rights?
The story is yours!
Do what you fucking want
with it!
So you really liked it?
I admit that when you said
it was based on our childhood
I felt
a bit apprehensive.
But I was very touched.
I'm so happy, man.
Remember I'm an actor
and I want out of Bumblebee.
Yes, I know that.
You'd be perfect
as Enrique Serrano,
naked on the bed,
with Zahara's letter
on the pillow.
¿Enrique Serrano?
I think I'd rather play Zahara.
Zahara, you?
You're crazy!
Why?
Well...
You're too well-built.
You're not right.
Martín, we've got our story!
I can slim down!
I can get into the part!
I'm used to that in the theater.
Like Robert De Niro...
Make a photocopy.
"The Visit"?
Yes.
Ignacio and I are starting
on the script.
If you're going to direct it,
it's best if you write it yourself.
All right, Ignacio.
Ángel!
Start calling me Ángel,
or you'll never get used to it.
Ángel.
Do you mind driving?
I'm a bit shaky.
I'm surprised you can even walk,
with all you've taken.
We had to celebrate, right?
I thought we'd be talking
about the project.
We'll talk later.
We've got time.
Remember?
Remember what?
Nothing.
You're really high.
What should I remember?
Nothing.
Turn off here.
Is all this yours?
No, no way.
I've just rented it.
Don't be too impressed,
it's a mess inside.
How about a swim?
It would do you good.
How's the water?
It's waiting for you.
Will you pass me a cigarette?
You weren't serious about
playing Zahara, were you?
Totally.
I don't joke about work either.
Then let's not talk about work.
What are you doing?
Sleeping here
or going back to Madrid?
If you want, I'll stay.
But talking about bodies,
if I look too manly
I can slim down.
I'm very flexible,
I can do anything.
You disconcert me, Ángel.
You told me that already.
And you told me
about slimming down.
Why don't we just talk clearly?
I can't say it
any more clearly1
I'm an actor.
I spent three fucking years
doing shit with Bumblebee.
This is my first chance
to get a terrific part
and I won't let it slip away.
You can't do Zahara.
Not at first sight,
but give me time!
You're a good director,
and I'll do anything!
You just have
to trust both of us.
I've tried.
But I can't trust you.
Why?
I just can't recognize
the Ignacio I knew at school.
The one who loved "Cuore Matto"
and so many other things.
My tastes have changed.
Is that what bothers you?
No.
People change with time.
Not you.
Simply, you're not Ignacio.
Who the fuck are you to decide
who I am or who I'm not?
How dare you?
Why am I not Ignacio?
Because I don't remember
a song from years ago?
Apart from that.
Because I'm not sucking your dick?
If I'd stayed like the kid you knew,
I'd be dead now.
I already am.
Dead tired.
I'm going to bed.
What are you doing?
I don't know.
You tell me.
Tell you what?
If I'm going to play Zahara.
Does your staying
depend on that?
No!
But if I don't play Zahara
there's no film.
Then I don't know
why you're here, cockteaser.
Get out!
Why the hell did I decide
to see you again, fucking faggot!
"A woman threw herself
into a pool of hungry crocodiles
in a zoo that was crowded
with visitors at the time.
When the first crocodile attacked,
the woman hugged it,
according to the witness.
The crocodiles devoured
the body of the woman,
who never complained,
in a few minutes."
What a horrible death!
Well...
She didn't even open her mouth.
What's on your mind?
Hungry crocodiles.
Hello.
Hello, come in.
It's the journalist.
Why are you here?
Ton interview me?
No.
Well, yes.
Which is it, cutie?
I'm not a journalist,
I'm an actor.
And I'd like you to help me
prepare a character.
What character?
A tranny who imitates
Sara Montiel, among others.
That's me!
Why don't they give me the part?
Well, you're not an actor,
you're just a faggot.
What you have to learn
is how to be polite,
because that's no way
to treat a lady!
I'm sorry.
So will you teach me?
And how will you pay me,
honey?
That's what I'm looking for!
Two minutes.
We'll talk later.
I'm on now.
Everything you do
is great for me.
I'm delighted.
See you later.
Ortigueira, 6 kilometers.
Hello.
Hello.
What can I get you?
A beer.
Forgive me for asking,
but how did you get that lighter?
You're not from here.
I stole it from a friend.
His family lives here.
Maybe you know him.
His name is Ángel Andrade.
Yes.
That's his stage name.
Sure, I know him.
You do?
Yes, very well.
That's great.
Who is it?
Enrique.
I was at school with Ignacio.
Go away
or I'll call the police!
Excuse me.
Are you Enrique Goded?
Yes.
I'm Ignacio's mother.
I'm delighted to meet you.
Come in.
Thank you.
Forgive my sister-in-law.
I've got the heart problem,
but she's the one who gets scared.
It doesn't matter.
Ignacio talked a lot about you.
We were very good friends.
I know.
The last time he came to see me
he wrote you a letter.
A letter?
I never got it.
It was three years ago.
He didn't know your address,
he sent it to the Ministry of Culture.
Then I'm not surprised.
By the time it was returned,
he was dead.
Let's go into the dining room.
That's my son Juan.
Then younger boy.
He's in the theater.
He's changed his name.
He says
there are too many Juans.
He wants even me
to call him Ángel.
I'd like to see Ignacio's room.
To be honest,
he didn't really have a room.
But when he came
he liked to use the attic.
Would you like to see it?
We're going upstairs!
Juan burned everything.
The notebooks, the clothes...
All except those magazines.
There's nothing left
of what Ignacio wrote?
No.
What a pity!
Are you from a publisher too?
No. What publisher?
Soon after Ignacio died,
a man came who was in charge
of publishing young authors,
Or so he said.
He was desperate to get
his hands on Ignacio's stories.
Do you remember his name,
or the publisher's?
No, but he was very insistent.
So I told the truth,
that Juan had burned everything,
and he even asked
for Juan's address.
I gave him a false one,
of course.
I think that man
was half mad.
This is Ignacio's letter.
It didn't get burned
because I never told Juan
it had been returned.
Thank you, ma'am.
Don't judge my Juan.
He's a good son,
but his brother's death
really hit him.
He was the one who found him.
You've directed
your first film, man.
You'll be pleased to hear
I'm still writing.
I'm enclosing a story
that would make a divine film.
It's incredible, but I ran into him
the other day in Valencia.
I'm visiting my mother now,
but I live in Valencia.
I've checked up,
he isn't a priest anymore.
He calls himself
by his last name, Berenguer.
He works in a publisher's,
he's married and has a son.
I thought: He's crying out
to be blackmailed!
So I wrote "The Visit",
the story I'm sending you.
At this point in my life,
I need a lot of money
and I'm going to get it
from that fucker!
Write to me and I'll tell you
the rest of the story.
All I'm asking
is to hear from you.
I can only share this story
with you.
I'll get it.
What do you want?
I've come to apologize.
I'll give you your shorts.
You left them behind.
Thank you.
I'm very sorry
about what I said.
I take it all back.
If you're still interested,
"The Visit" is yours.
Do it with whomever
and however you want.
Have you lost weight?
Yes.
I'm really working on it.
I want to lose even more.
And I'm taking classes.
Classes in what?
In how to be a queen.
I'm working with the best
Sara Montiel impersonator.
She performs at "Bambola",
a gay club.
I'm workin as a waiter there.
so I can study the queens
more closely.
Then you're still
thinking about Zahara.
Yes.
Just let me do an audition.
Thank you.
You had it!
Yes, you left that behind too.
Ignacio,
I'd like to talk...
Until you call me Ángel,
I won't believe you're taking me seriously.
Ángel,
I'm sure you're a good actor,
now more than ever.
So you'll let me audition?
The audition worked
for several months,
long enough for me to throw myself
into the shooting of "The Visit",
like the woman who
threw herself to the crocodiles
and hugged them
as they ate her.
You've changed the ending.
Yes.
"The Visit" can't end happily,
like your story.
Why not?
Zahara can't just
walk out of the school.
She's a threat to the priests.
And we know
what the Church is capable of.
But this ending
is really heavy, man.
For you, as an actor,
it's much more intresting.
You think so?
Of course.
I shot "The Visit"
as a homage to Ignacio.
In his letter, he'd said
he'd love to see it on the screen.
And also to discover
the enigma of Juan.
He allowed me
to penetrate him frequently,
We were about to finish shooting
and his mystery was still intact.
Silence!
And... roll camera!
Rolling!
"The Visit"
Zahara, darling!
Action!
The boys are in class
and I'm sick of arguing.
Let me out!
Do you want to kidnap me?
Open the door!
I have to take a piss,
buy cigarettes, get a fix!
Even if I got the money,
how can I be sure
you won't blackmail me again?
You'll never be sure.
That's my revenge.
Let me out or I'll scream.
I loved Ignacio.
You don't love a boy of ten.
You harass him, you abuse him!
I loved him.
Please, let me out!
I'm locked in!
She's threatening
to denounce us.
She wants a million pesetas
to keep quiet.
If you give her a single peseta,
you'll never stop paying.
I knew we'd meet again,
scum!
You know her?
You knew him
much better than I did.
It's Ignacio Rodríguez.
Ignacio!
It can't be!
We have to finish him off.
He's a threat
to the whole congregation!
He wants to say something.
Yes, that we let him do.
If you're going to kill me,
I'd like to confess first.
Confess what?
Thanks to you
we've got no way out.
You have to stay calm.
I'll get rid of the body.
How?
It's best if you know nothing.
It was self-defense, Father.
He'd have made
our lives impossible.
Yes,
I guess so.
And there are no witnesses.
God.
Yes,
but He's on our side.
Cut!
We've cut, guys!
This one's good.
What about the other one?
Give me No. 1 as well.
Well done, guys.
No, it was great.
Is anything wrong, Ángel?
No.
I'll see you later.
It went really well.
Put that down!
Who are you?
The villain in your film.
Father Manolo!
Mr. Berenguer.
I'm not even a father
to my own son now.
Get out!
I read in a magazine
that you were here.
Go and drink some hot milk
with honey, and take an aspirin,
and leave me alone.
I've got a lot to do,
I can't waste time on you.
Not even to find out
how Ignacio died?
Or who killed him?
And if it concedes
with your film?
Say what you have to say
and go.
I was living Valencia.
I worked for a publisher
that promoted young writers.
Three years ago, I received
a story called "The Visit",
signed by Ignacio Rodríguez.
Ignacio Rodríguez calling
about the new writers anthology.
Didn't you tell him
he was rejected?
Yes, but he insists
on speaking to you.
He's on your line.
Yes.
Excuse me?
Are you the author of "The Visit"?
We decided not to include it
in "Short Stories of the 80s"
I'm sorry.
I think not.
I've got nothing more to say.
and you were
madly in love with me.
I remember how
you'd embrace me from behind
I remember the buttons
on your sauterne
I'll expect you
at my house at 7:00.
My address is on the back
of the envelope, Father Manolo.
That wasn't the Ignacio
you and I loved.
Hello, Mr. Berenguer.
I'm Ignacio.
Please, come in.
Yes, I'm a junkie,
but I want to quit
and I thought you could help me.
Well, I know a clinic.
So do I, but first I want
to fix myself up a bit.
I know I've got divine tits,
but everything else...
Anyway, I won't get into that.
Looking pretty
costs a lot of money, Father Manolo.
I think a million would do it.
A million?
Yes, in cash, and my lips
are sealed. I won't say a word.
You're out of your mind!
Sexual harassment
is frowned upon, Father Manolo.
What would your wife think,
or your boss?
You're in no position
to blackmail anyone.
I could have you
arrested tonight.
Very well.
You call the police,
I'll call your wife and the media.
A blackmailer can't be
as defenseless as you are.
Believe me,
I know what I'm saying.
Juan, go back to your room.
I want to watch TV.
Watch it later,
we're talking business.
I don't mind if he stays.
I'm sure you don't.
He's my brother,
he's looking after me.
Or that's my mother's idea.
I'm Mr. Berenguer.
One million, end of story.
Do you want me
to call him Juan,
or Ángel?
The blackmail
became an investment for me.
I visited the brothers frequently
so I could keep seeing Juan.
Remember Don Narciso,
the Nazi?
He love my illustrations.
Look at this one.
And there's another one...
Look, this is beautiful.
And this one...
"Children of Spain"
I brought you this.
I kept Ignacio happy
with small amounts of money.
Hello.
Hello.
You brought the dough?
I can only give you 50,000.
You said
you'd bring the million!
I said they'd tell me today
if I'd get the loan.
They said yes,
but they have
to check my guarantees.
I need another three weeks.
Another three weeks!
I'm a junkie.
Haven't you noticed?
I could be dead in three weeks.
Are you going away?
Obviously!
I want to see my mother
before I check in.
She has to see me with these teeth
and this face, and it's your fault!
Don't be unfair, Ignacio,
I'm doing what I can.
Then do more!
I'll be gone for a week.
When I come back
I want that million.
If you don't have it, you'll be sorry.
I'm sick of being put off!
I'll try to hurry them up, but...
Father.
Come along.
Shall I help you?
Sure, take the Olivetti,
it's the heaviest.
While you're at it,
take this one too.
Stop that taxi.
Taxi.
Bye, Father.
Goodbye.
Open the trunk, please.
My scarf!
Excuse me.
I've come for my scarf.
I must have left it here.
Fuck, it's really soft!
Silk.
It's yours.
To be honest,
I left it here for you.
Cut it out,
I'm not Ignacio!
Fortunately.
What time is it?
Did he give you anything
for me?
Ignacio? No.
Fuck!
I had to pay
my school fees today.
Are you studying?
Yes. Drama.
I'm an actor.
Selfish bastard!
He knew I had to pay today
and he didn't give me anything.
Obviously, I paid his fees.
I hadn't told Ignacio
but the bank had granted me
a loan of two million.
I withdrew the first million.
I told my wife I was going
to a conference abroad.
She didn't believe me.
I guess
that doesn't interest you.
Not in the least.
How did Ignacio die?
The week Juan and I
spent alone
was the happiest in my life.
Every day
I bought him something.
Clothes, a walkman,
a Super-8 camera.
I enjoyed the gifts
more than he did.
Take off your shirt.
Take it off!
Now it's my turn!
Now, take that off.
Show me your cock.
If you're going to shoot my dick,
don't show my face!
Too late.
I can't...!
You!
Give me some dough!
I've got the fucking sweats.
How's mom?
She had another heart attack.
But she's all right now.
I'm the one who's sick.
The dough!
More!
That's all I have.
I want that million now!
No more excuses!
No more stalling
and no more gifts.
Mom!
How are you, Juan?
Has Ignacio arrived?
Yes!
what happened this time?
The usual thing, son, but...
He stole my pension,
and I'd just gotten it!
Is that true?
Tell auntie
I'll send her some money.
He promised me
he was going into a clinic.
And you believed him?
Yes, this time he really means it.
He's going to try.
How?
By being with him.
Don't leave him.
Promise me.
I promise.
the cheese and the chorizos?
Delicous!
Why did you bother?
There's food in Valencia.
Don't spend your money.
They're your favorites.
I'd kept them for you.
All right, thanks.
Yes, call me if anything happens.
Bye.
Where's Ignacio?
I'm going to kill him!
It was Juan's idea.
Or mine, I don't know.
The only solution
was to get rid of him.
More or less
what you've just shot.
But not as violent.
How did you think of it?
Ignacio's story
doesn't end like that.
While I was adapting it,
I found out that Ignacio was dead.
Did Juan tell you?
No.
I found out myself.
Will you just tell me
how it happened?
I arranged to meet Juan
at the Museum of Giant Figures.
Much more than
it seemed at first.
I'll buy the junk
and you give it to him.
Why me?
Fuck, he's my brother!
I'm not a monster.
Do you think
this doesn't hurt me?
But he's ruining all our lives.
What will we do afterwards?
We won't meet for a while.
Why?
You said
there'd be no investigation.
Just in case.
It's best
not to arouse suspicion.
I'll go and look after my mother,
she'll need it.
When things calm down,
I'll call you and we'll go away.
Have you got the money?
Yes.
No.
What will I do
while I'm waiting?
Work, earn money.
We'll need it.
The situation at home
is unbearable.
Apologize to your wife
and enjoy your son.
Tell her the truth.
What?
Say you've been
with someone else,
a woman.
Give me your mother's address.
It's best if I don't.
Then you won't be tempted
to come see me.
What are they laughing at?
They're laughing at us.
At me, at least.
Juan bought deadly pure heroin.
He gave it to me
and I went to Ignacio's.
Alone.
This is my last fix.
What do you mean?
I'm quitting.
This time I really am.
Before I get my face
and all the rest done,
I'm checking
into a detox clinic.
I've already applied.
Good.
You'll have the money tomorrow.
I hope so.
Before noon, Ok?
Just in case,
I wrote two letters,
one for the publisher
and the other for your wife,
telling all you've hidden from them
in the past and present.
That's unnecessary. Give them to me!
When I get the money.
Before noon.
Pretty, aren't they?
What?
My tits.
Yes, they're wonderful.
Thank you.
Shall I help you?
No, no.
Go away.
I don't like fixing
in front of you.
It's done.
Pull in here.
We'll go to the cinema
to kill time.
It's as if all the films
were talking about us.
Now what?
I'm going home.
You want me to go with you?
No, you'd better not.
Remember to get
those two letters.
Yes.
If you don't
we'll be in trouble.
I'll get everything
don't worry.
If we won't be seeing
each other for a while,
give me some of the Super-8s.
It would console me
to see us screwing.
You're nuts!
What if your wife saw them?
We have to burn them.
I'll take care of that.
Let's go.
Get in for a minute.
No, I'm going to take a taxi.
Then,
I won't see you again?
It's just for a few days.
Taxi.
Call me as soon as you can.
Yes.
Ignacio?
Enrique.
What's wrong?
You!
At last!
I read in this film magazine
that you were here.
What did you tell him?
Everything.
Now you only have me, darling.
You're crazy.
Remember I've got
my brother's letters,
accusing you of his death.
We both did it, my love.
The letters only mention you.
Enrique, wait!
Enrique.
Are you all right?
Leave me alone!
If I ever see you again,
I swear I'll kill you!
Now that I've found you,
I won't let you go.
Get used to the idea.
Mónica.
Can you give me a lift?
Sure.
Yes?
Get in the front.
Hello.
Who was that?
Someone looking for Enrique.
It's me.
Give me back the keys.
Your things are in the hall.
Take them away.
The taxi's gone.
You'll have to lend me the car
or drive me back to Madrid.
I want to order a taxi.
Enrique Goded, yes.
Thank you.
I was going to tell you
after the shoot.
Tell me what?
That my name is Juan.
That I'm Ignacio's brother
and Ignacio died four years ago.
I knew that already.
I know that you knew.
What do you mean?
My mother rang to tell me
you'd been to the house.
I guessed
you'd learned everything.
When you asked for the audition,
you knew that I knew?
Yes.
And you still kept pretending?
What else could I do?
I didn't lie
you knew everything.
No, I didn't, far from it.
I knew you'd taken Ignacio's place
and that he was dead,
but I never imagined
that you'd killed him!
That's the taxi.
I didn't kill him, Berenguer did!
Ignacio was blackmailing him.
And you were hustling him!
The taxi's waiting.
You don't know what it is like
to have a brother like that
and live in a small town.
Juan,
the taxi is waiting.
Why did you choose me?
You still don't see me
as Zahara.
Was it just to fuck me?
It was curiosity.
I wanted to see
how far you would go
and how much I could take.
I would go a lot further.
I bet you would.
You needn't explain any more.
It's not mine.
It's from Ignacio.
Dear Enrique:
I think I've succeeded...
