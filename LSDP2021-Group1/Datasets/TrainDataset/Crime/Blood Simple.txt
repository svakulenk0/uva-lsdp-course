The world is full of complainers.
The fact is,
nothing comes with a guarantee.
I don't care if you're
the pope of Rome,
president of the United States
or man of the year.
Go ahead, you know, complain,
tell your problems to your neighbor,
ask for help
and watch him fly.
Now, in Russia,
they got it mapped out...
so that everyone pulls
for everyone else.
Down here,
you're on your own.
He gave me a little pearl-handled .38
for our first anniversary.
Un-huh.
Figured I'd better leave
before I used it on him.
I just don't know how
you can stand him.
I'm only an employee.
I ain't married to him. Yeah.
It's just...
I don't know.
Sometimes I think maybe there's
something wrong with him.
Like maybe he's sick...
mentally.
Or is it maybe me,
do you think?
Listen, l...
I ain't a marriage counselor.
I don't know what goes on.
I don't wanna know.
But I like you.
I always liked you.
What are you gonna do in Houston?
I'll figure something out.
How come you offered
to drive me in this mess?
I told you.
I like you.
I never knew that.
Well, now you do.
Hell!
Stop the car, Ray!
No.
What's the matter?
I don't know.
I just think maybe
I'm making a mistake.
What was that back there?
Back where?
That sign.
Motel.
Abby...
Ray?
Did you mean what you said before?
Or were you just being a gentleman?
Abby, I like you.
But it's no point
in starting anything now.
Yeah.
- I mean, I ain't a marriage counselor.
- Yeah.
What do you wanna do?
What do you wanna do?
Hello.
Having a good time?
Who is this?
I don't know.
Who's this?
You still there?
Yeah, I'm still here.
Ray?
Yeah?
Who was it?
Your husband.
# Put your sweet lips #
# A little closer
to the phone #
# And let's pretend
that we're together #
# Tell the man
to turn thejukebox #
I know where you
can get those framed.
Why'd you take these?
What do you mean?
Just doin'my job.
You called me. I knew they were there.
Why'd you take 'em?
I don't know.
Call it a fringe benefit.
How long
you watch 'em?
They'd rest every few minutes, then...
they'd get started again.
Hmm.
Hmm. You know in Greece...
they would cut off the head of the
messenger that brought the bad news.
No.
Made them feel better.
Well, first off,
I don't know what
the story is in Greece,
but in this state we got very</i
definite laws about that.
Second,
I'm not a messenger.
And third
and most important,
it ain't such bad news.
I mean, you thought
he was colored.
You're always assumin' the worst.
Anything else?
Mm-hmm.
Don't come around here anymore.
If I need ya,
I'll know what rock to turn over.
That's good!
"What rock to turn over."
Give me a call whenever
you wanna cut off my head.
I can always crawl around without it.
We'll be back after a spell.
Hope you will be too.
Hold it, hold it.
##
# You're sweet as a honeybee #
# But like
a honeybee's sting #
Where was I?
You were telling me about the
Ring of Fire. Oh, yeah, right. Look.
You got all these volcanoes, right?
And every time one goes "pop,"
you got the equivalent of what?
- Twenty, thirty megatons of T.N.T.
- Meurice.
Yeah, I know, Marty, pour 'em short.
Did Ray come in yet?
You know it's his night off.
Where was he last night? How would
I know where he was last night?
I don't know.
Didn't he call?
Marty, this is, um,
an old friend of mine,
this is Debra.
- Deuce in the corner needs help.
- Right.
How long you known Meurice?
About ten years.
Ten years.
What are you doin' tonight?
Goin' out with Meurice.
Tell him you have a headache.
I'll pass.
We don't seem to be...
communicating...
Look, you wanna hustle me? I don't
wanna be hustled. You don't?
It's as simple as that.
Oh, it's as simple as that.
Meurice, I'm not here
if Ray comes, okay?
- Right.
- Right.
Nice guy.
Not really.
What'd you say
your last name was?
Opal.
Ray?
Yeah?
Let's get outta here.
You get what you wanted?
Yeah. Let's get outta here.
Drive me to a motel?
You can stay at my place.
I'll drop you there.
Where are you going?
See a guy.
Ray, don't go to the bar.
I know him.
It ain't a good idea.
I've just gotta see a guy.
# Sweet dreams of you #
So, it's a deal.
You and your colleagues find a way to
harness this vast volcanic energy,
and I just sit back and watch
these shitkickers go broke.
Howdy, stranger.
Meurice, sorry about last night.
No sweat. Wasn't too busy.
You missed a good one though.
This white guy walks in about 1:00 and
asks if we have a discount for alcoholics.
I tell him to get lost.
Now, Marty's here and I can tell he's
thinking that maybe that ain't such a bad idea.
Marty?
What "what"?
Am I fired?
You wanna hit me, what?
I don't particularly
want to talk to you.
Well,
you're not gonna fire me,
I might as well quit.
Fine.
Suit yourself.
Having a good time?
I don't like
this kind of talk.
What'd you come here for?
You owe me for two weeks.
No.
She's an expensive piece
of ass.
But you get a refund if you tell me
who else she's been sluicing.
I want that money.
You got somethin' to tell me, fine.
You a fucking marriage counselor?
I'm funny, right?
I'm an asshole?
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.
That's not what's funny.
What's funny is her.
What's funny is that
I had you two followed...
because if it's not you she's sleeping
with, it's someone else.
And what's really gonna be funny...
is when she gives you
that innocent look and says,
"I don't know what
you're talkin' about, Ray.
I ain't
done anything funny."
But the funniest thing
to me right now...
is that you think
that she came back here for you.
That's what's fucking funny!
Come on this property again,
I'll be forced to shoot you.
Fair notice.
Hey, Marty?
Marty, thought you were dead.
You goin' home?
No.
I'm staying right here in hell.
It's kind of a bleak point of view,
isn't it, Marty?
Meurice,
I don't want the asshole near my money.
And I don't want him in the bar.
We get a lot of assholes in here, Marty.
Hello?
Marty?
- Who was it?
- What?
On the phone.
Was it for you?
I don't know.
He didn't say anything.
How'd you know it was a he?
You got a girl?
Am I screwing something up by being here?
No.
Am I?
I can find a place tomorrow,
and I'll be out of your hair.
If that's what you wanna do
then you oughta do it.
You, uh...
You want the bed or the couch?
Well,
couch will be all right.
You can sleep on the bed if you want.
I'm not gonna put you
outta your bed.
Wouldn't be puttin' me out.
I'll be all right here.
Okay.
Opal?
Lover-boy oughta lock his door.
Lotta nuts out there.
Let's do it outside...
in nature, hmm?
I'd like to have seen his face
when he found the dead end.
##
Hey, mister,
how'd you break your pussy finger?
I'm sorry, sweetheart,
my date is here.
She saw me rolling a cigarette,
thought it was marijuana.
Thought I was a swinger.
Stick your finger
up the wrong person's ass?
You know, you know,
a friend of mine a while back broke
his hand, put in a cast.
The very next day he falls, protects his
bad hand and he breaks his good one.
He breaks that too, you know?
Now he's got two busted flippers.
So I says to him...
I said, "Creighton, I hope your wife
really loves you.
'Cause for the next five weeks, you
can't even wipe your own goddamn ass."
That's a test.
Test of true love.
- I got a job for you.
-
Well, if the pay's right and it's legal,
I'll do it.
Well, if the pay's right,
I'll do it.
It's in reference
to that gentleman and my wife.
the more irritated I get.
Could you tell me what it is
you want me to do,
or is it a secret?
It's no joke.
You want me to kill 'em.
Well...
Well what?
What do you think?
So this wouldn't...
wouldn't interest you, huh?
I didn't say that.
All I said was you're an idiot.
Hell, you've been thinkin' about it
for so much, it's driving you simple.
I'll give you $ 10,000.
I'm supposed to...
do a murder...
two murders...
trust you not to go simple on me...
I mean really stupid.
Now why should I trust you?
For the money.
The money.
Yeah,
that's a right smart of money.
In Russia,
they make only 50 cent a day.
I want you, uh, to go fishing.
What?
Go down to Corpus for a few days.
I'll give you a call when it's done.
You just find a way
to cover that money.
I'll take care of the money.
You make sure those bodies aren't found.
There's a big incinerator
behind my place.
So you want like a town house?
Your own apartment?
I show you around.
You sure this apartment is vacant,
Mrs. Esteves? - Oh, yes.
I was just explaining
to him...
that he moved out yesterday.
Don't mind Mr. Garcia.
He used to be my brother-in-law.
Looks like the state legislature
is out of session.
Yeah, I thought
this was where they met.
Listen, you're gonna help me
with a problem. - I am?
You're gonna keep an eye on Marty
and Ray. Make sure nothing happens.
Gentlemen, let's show our appreciation
for Lorraine up there,
a registered nurse from Bolton, Texas.
How 'bout it, gentlemen?
Thanks, Meurice.
Any time.
Hey, you don't have to worry 'bout a thing
for a while. Marty went to Corpus yesterday.
He's in the house.
He's in the house!
What's the matter?
Could've sworn I heard somethin'.
Door's locked.
There's nothing there.
Well,
I guess we wouldn't have heard
anything if it had been him.
He's real careful.
Fact is...
he's anal, Ray.
Huh?
Mm-hmm. He told me once himself.
He said to me...
"In here...
Abby, in here I'm anal."
Well, I'll be damned.
I couldn't believe it myself.
Me, on the other hand,
I got lots of personality.
Marty said I had too much.
But he was never big on personality.
He sent me to a psychiatrist once to see
if he could calm me down some.
Yeah?
And what happened?
Psychiatrist said I was the healthiest
person he ever met so Marty fired him.
I don't think you can fire
a psychiatrist, exactly.
I never saw him again.
I can tell you that much. Mm-hmm.
I said, "Marty,
how come you're anal and I gotta go
to the psychiatrist?"
What did he say?
Nothing.
Just like you.
He doesn't say much.
Thanks.
Except when he doesn't say things,
they're usually nasty. Mm-hmm.
And when you don't, they're usually nice.
You ever get tired?
Hmm?
Oh, yeah, I guess.
Uh-huh.
Hello?
Marty?
Yeah.
Catch any fish?
What?
Catch any fish?
Yeah, yeah.
What kind of fish?
Listen, is it done? Yes, sir.
You owe me some money.
If you're fucking with me,
you'll regret it.
They look good.
Why?
You want a couple?
Just the 10,000
will be fine.
Got something to show me first?
Dead?
So it would seem.
What'd you do with the bodies?
It's taken care of.
The less you know about it,
the better.
Jesus.
I don't believe it.
I'm gonna be sick.
I'm gonna want that picture back.
- You did say somethin' about the money.
- Yeah, the money.
Somethin' I gotta ask you, Marty.
I've been very,
very careful.
Have you been very,
very careful?
Of course.
Nobody knows you hired me?
Don't be stupid.
I'm not about to tell anyone.
We have to learn to be discreet.
Trust each other.
For richer...
for poorer.
Don't say that.
Your marriages
don't turn out so hot.
How did you cover the money?
It's been taken care of.
The less you know about it,
the better.
I made a call.
It'll be all right.
You must've gone
money simple.
A murder like this,
it's too risky.
Then you shouldn't have done it.
Can't have it both ways.
Count it...
and go.
Nah.
I trust ya.
Who looks stupid now?
Damn.
Marty?
What's the matter, you deaf?
Marty?
What night is tonight?
Tuesday.
What?
Tuesday night is Ladies' Night.
# You're sweet as a honeybee #
# You've gone and left my heart in pain #
# All you left is our favorite song #
# The one we danced to
all night long #
# It used to bring sweet memories #
# Of a tender love
that used to be #
# But with a different meaning
since you been gone #
# But with a different meaning
since you been gone #
# But the melody
keeps haunting me #
# Reminding me how
in love we used to be #
# Keep hearing the part that
used to touch my heart #
# Saying, together forever
Breaking up never #
# But with a different meaning

...eighty percent in the last three years.
What's more,
in two years'time,
we'll be experiencing what's known as
the Jupiter Effect...
when all the planets of the known
universe will align up...
'causin'an incredible buildup
of destructive gravitational force.
Now in Matthew, Chapter Six,
Verse 18,
by which we shall know
that He is at our door.
There are many good people
who disagree with me,
but it's my belief
that this Antichrist...
and livin'in the ten-nation alliance
I spoke of...
I'll be here with you till 6:00 this
morning, then Mike Miller will be stepping in.
These are requests here
we had to dig for.

Hello.
Abby, you all right?
Ray? What time is it?
I don't know.
It's early.
I love you.
You all right?
Well, I'll see ya.
And thanks, Ray.
Abby...
Hey, Ray.
#
- Why didn't you get into bed?
- I didn't think I could sleep.
I'm surprised
you could.
I just wanted to let you know
that everything is all right.
Now all we have to do
is keep our heads.
What do you mean?
I know about it, Abby.
- I went to the bar last night.
- What happened?
Was Meurice there?
Yeah.
He didn't see me,
though.
Nobody saw me.
- Is it cold in here?
- Well, what happened?
I cleaned it all up.
But that ain't important.
What's important is what we do now.
We can't go around half-cocked.
What we need is, uh, time to think
about this... figure it out.
We got some time now.
But we gotta be smart.
- Ray... - Never point a gun at
anyone unless you mean to shoot him.
And if you shoot him,
you better make sure he's dead.
'Cause if he ain't dead,
he's gonna try and kill you.
The only thing they taught us in
the service that's worth a goddamn.
Where in the hell's my windbreaker?
Ray,
just tell me what happened.
That ain't important.
What's important is that we did it.
That's the only thing that matters.
We both did it for each other.
That's what's important.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I mean,
what are you talking about?
I haven't done anything funny.
What was that?
You ain't even acting like yourself.
First you call me 5 in the a.m.,
saying all kinds of nice things on the phone.
And then you come charging in here
scaring me half to death...
without even telling me
what I'm supposed to be scared of.
If you two had a fight
or something, I don't care.
Just as long as...
Pick it up.
What?
Well, that was him.
- Who?
- Marty.
What's going on
with you two?
#
All right.
You can call him back,
whoever it was.
I'll get out of your way.
You left your weapon behind.
Hi, Meurice.
This is Helene.
Helene Trend, you know?
I'm calling 'cause I wanna know what the
remark about Sylvia is supposed to mean.
She says you're full of shit,
and, frankly, I believe her.
And, hey, I love you too.
You better call me soon...
'cause I'm going to South America tonight...
Uruguay.
Listen, asshole. It's Marty.
I just got back
from Corpus Christi,
and a lot of money's missing from the safe...
a lot of money.
I'm not saying you took it,
but the place was your responsibility.
And I told you to keep
an eye on your asshole friend.
Don't come to the bar tonight. I got some busi...
Damn. What is this?
The bar's still gonna be closed tonight.
I've got some other business
to take care of.
But tomorrow I wanna
have a word with you...
and with Ray,
if you can find him.
I hope you're planning on leaving town.
- You got a problem, Meurice?
- No, but you do, cowboy.
Have you been to the bar?
Why?
You shouldn't have taken the fuckin' money!
Look at me, man.
I'm serious.
You broke in the bar and you
ripped off the fuckin' safe.
Abby warned me about you. You know what your
problem is? You're too fuckin' obvious.
The only two people with the combination
are you and me and Abby, maybe.
These fucking things
are nothing but coffin nails.
Hey, look, Ray.
Personally,
I don't give a shit, you know?
I know Marty's a hard-on,
but you gotta do something...
say you're sorry,
give the money back,
get the fuck out of here or something.
Shit!
It's very humiliating,
preaching about this bullshit.
But I'm not laughing, Ray Bob, so
you know it's no fucking joke.
Damn.
Ray?
Lover-boy oughta lock the door.
That's a stupid thing to say, right?
I love you too.
No.
You'rejust saying that
because you're scared.
Ray?
Where is everything?
In the trunk.
In the car.
- You leavin'?
- Isn't that what you want?
- Wanna come with me?
- I gotta know what happened first.
What you wanna know?
You broke into the bar. You wanted to get
your money, and you and Marty had a fight,
and somethin'hap...
I don't know.
Wasn't it you?
- Maybe a burglar broke in...
- With your gun?
Nobody broke in, Abby.
I'll tell you the truth.
The truth is...
I've been feeling sick
the last couple of days.
Can't sleep.
When I try...
Abb...
The truth is...
he was alive when I buried him.
-
-
Yeah,
just a second!
Abby, what's the matter?
I think Marty's dead.
Can I come in?
That's bullshit.
Marty called me after he was jacked up.
I don't know where Marty is,
but he's not dead.
Now, you relax,
and I'll go find him.
And stay away from Ray.
The guy's gone nuts.
R-Ray...
Just turn it off.
Why?
- No curtains on the windows.
- So?
- I think someone's watching.
- So what'll they see?
Just leave it off.
He can see in.
If you do anything,
the neighbors will hear.
You think...
when I called.
I love you too.
All right.
You got some
personal property of mine.
Now, what did you do...
I don't know what the hell you two
thought you were gonna pull off.
-
-
I'm not afraid of you, Marty.
Well, ma'am, if I see him,
# You're sweet
as a honeybee #
# But like a honeybee stings
You've gone and left my heart in pain #
# All you left
