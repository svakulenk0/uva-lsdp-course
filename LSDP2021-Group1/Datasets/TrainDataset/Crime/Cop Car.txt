Asshole.
Asshole.
Ass face.
Ass face.
How far do you think we've gone?
I think we're almost to the woods.
Come on.
Don't get rust poisoning.
Come on!
I thought it was an arrowhead.
Bitch.
Bitch.
Shit.
Shit.
Shithead.
Shithead.
Fuck.
Say it. Fuck.
That's the worst cuss.
Actually, my friend,
he's in eighth grade,
he says that it's just
a different language from Russia,
so it's fine to say it.
Oh, look.
- What?
- Snake hole!
I'm gonna leave mine in there
in case they try to escape.
Good idea.
Wanna see a magic trick?
- No way!
- Want some?
Yeah.
- We gotta ration it, though.
- Okay.
Two centimeters each a day.
Wait, why don't you keep it
in your pocket?
Pickpockets. Got my wallet in here, too.
- The creek should be right over...
- Get down!
What?
It's the cops.
We haven't even been gone that long.
- You're right.
- Did they see us?
I don't think so.
We can distract them.
Throw this on the far side
to make a noise.
Oh, crap!
- You hit it!
- Oh, shit!
- Shit!
- I hit a cop car.
Let's go!
Wait, wait, wait!
It has my fingerprints on it.
- Mine, too.
- Okay. Go get it.
No way.
Fine. Chicken.
Wait.
Go that way. It's better camouflage.
- There's no one in there.
- They could be hiding.
My dad says sometimes cops put
empty cop cars nears roads
so that people won't speed
'cause they think they're real cop cars.
But there's no road.
Do you see it?
I don't know. It could be any of them.
Come on. Let's just go.
I dare you to touch it.
The cop car?
No way.
If I do it, you have to do it.
Okay.
- Ready?
- Stay low just in case they're hiding.
Now!
Okay.
Your turn.
Oh, crap, oh, crap, oh, crap!
Oh, crap, oh, crap, oh, crap!
Come on, come on, come on!
No way!
Quick, get in.
Get in.
Nuh-uh.
- Why?
- Look.
So?
Hit the boosters!
There's a lot of bad guys behind us!
I'll shoot 'em!
- Did you kill 'em?
- No, look out!
You're driving us right off of a cliff!
No!
Where's the siren?
We need to get out of this lava!
Holy shit!
No way.
Which one?
The big one?
It fits.
Do you know how to drive?
Yeah, I know. "Mario Kart."
Yeah, me, too.
- Me first!
- Wait!
Try this one.
Awesome!
Why isn't it going?
It's moving. It's moving!
Quick, get in.
We're gonna get in trouble!
We already ran away. It doesn't matter.
What if someone sees us?
We'll just tell them we're cops.
Good idea.
This is our cop car now.
- Oh, shit, oh, shit, oh, shit!
- Oh, shit, oh, shit!
Oh, shit!
Impossible!
This is our cop car!
This is our cop car!
This is our cop car!
- This is our cop car!
- Cop car!
Oh, shit.
Hello. Hey, hey, hey there.
Hey there, Miranda. Hello, Miranda.
Hey there, Miranda.
Hey. Hello, there.
-
- Hey there, Miranda. Mitch Kretzer.
- It's been better, I'm afraid.
-
Well, I seem to be having some trouble
with my radio. Not sure what it is.
Is this the one in your patrol car
or the one you got in your truck?
Patrol car.
Some kind of odd interference I'm getting,
maybe a trucker channel cutting through
or those boys out east with their remote
control airplanes. Who knows?
- Anything odd on your end?
-
I tried to radio in to y'all ladies.
You didn't hear that?
I see that.
I thought y'all was just giving me
the cold shoulder.
-
- Okay, well...
I'm gonna see if it's a short
in the receiver,
and in the meantime,
if you do need to reach me,
why don't you just go ahead
and call me on my cell?
Are you sure you don't want me
to send Gary down there to have a look?
No. No. I'm gonna see if I can
handle this one by myself.
-
- Thank you kindly.
Have a good day.
Any games?
Now me.
- What should I say?
- Be quiet!
They can't hear unless
I push down the button.
I know.
Say cops are... cops are...
cops drink diarrhea milkshakes.
Cops drink diarrhea milkshakes
and then poop double diarrhea.
-
- Okay.
Wait. But they're gonna know
we're not cops.
Yeah, you're right. They probably
know all the cops' voices.
Can I drive?
It keeps going when I take my foot
off this thing. Look.
- Why's it doing that?
- I don't know.
I know. You jump out and run around,
and I'll scoot over and be like,
"Hurry, get in!"
Okay. One, two, three, go!
That was awesome!
There's a lot of stuff back here.
- What do I do?
- What?
Look.
That's a real road. We can go
way faster on the real road.
Should I crash through the gate?
Nah.
I'll get it.
- Shit.
- Did that break it?
It must be titanium.
- Can you open the lock?
- No.
- Try hitting it with the car.
- Okay.
It's working.
A little further.
I'm pushing as hard as I can.
It's working!
Push your foot down all the...
Serious shit!
Oh, shit!
- That was awesome!
- Yeah, that was so awesome.
Let's see how fast we can go.
Yeah, okay.
Okay, get it all the way up to the 100.
How fast am I going now?
Let me try.
It still won't stop.
Oh, I know. Pull on that shifter thingy.
Okay, R means go backwards
and P means stop.
Makes sense.
This is so awesome!
Look out!
Yeah!
Fuck you, Marcie!
Yeah.
Come on, bitch. Get on there.
Get on there. Come on. Come on.
Get on there, bitch.
Get on.
Okay, baby.
Okay, come to Daddy.
Come on, now.
God!
Oh, shit.
Come on, baby.
Come on, get on there. Get...
Got it.
-
- Miranda. Mitch again.
Hey there, Sheriff.
Any luck with that radio?
I'll tell you what,
you haven't missed a thing...
Hey, we got any units
in the Jefferson area?
-
- I think I might have a 2-11 in progress.
Suspect on foot
somewhere in the vicinity...
in the vicinity of Widefield Drive
and Imperial.
Can you call that in for me? Code three.
Sorry, Sheriff, I didn't catch
that last part. Widefield and...?
Widefield Drive and Imperial.
Code three.
Roll the window down, sir.
License, registration,
proof of insurance, please.
Is there a problem?
I'm gonna need you to step
out of the car for me, please, sir.
Calling all units.
There's a 2-11 in progress.
Suspect on foot near Widefield
and Imperial. Code three.
Dispatch, this is 55.
I'm 10-95 at Imperial and Cherokee.
I can cover on that.
Just sit tight. I only need
to see your registration.
Proceed to Widefield
and Imperial. Code three.
How are you doing today, ma'am?
- I'm good. Yourself?
- I'm fine. Kind of slow.
I swear I think I just saw
the craziest thing out there.
Okay, I'll be right back.
Okay.
So you wanna come pick up?
Okay, what would you like?
Okay, enjoy your lunch. Okay, thank you.
Excuse me, Officers?
...more than anyone!
Daniel trusts his own to arrive.
They'll go to everlasting life
or everlasting death.
Mitch, we're starting to get
some radio interference now, too.
Yeah, I'm having a hell
of a time with my radio.
We just got a report
of a stolen sheriff's cruiser.
A what?
Could be what's causing
the interference.
Yeah, but everyone
is accounted for, right?
Of course. It's just this lady
is sure she saw two kids
Two kids.
How old?
Under 10. Well...
Miranda, I think we can...
I think we can go ahead
and throw that one in the nut file
- since everyone's accounted for.
-
But I'll tell you what.
How about we all switch over to channel
seven until we get this sorted out?
Well, we normally keep channel seven
open just in case...
Just for my own peace of mind.
I hear you. I'll switch the rest
of the boys over to seven.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Just... just... just to be safe.
Attention, all units,
Attention, all units, please 10-6
to channel seven until further notice.
-
-
Dispatch, this is 17
switching over to channel seven.
Confirmed. Dispatch
switching over to channel seven.
Hello, ladies.
Hush. Hush.
I said hush!
Hey. Hey.
All right, kids. Fun's over.
I know who you are, and you are
in a whole hell of a lot of trouble.
Do you understand?
It's downright stupid to steal
a police car, but you've done it.
Now, what's done is done.
And what we're looking at
is a felony offense.
A felony offense.
And what that means
is guaranteed jail time.
The only thing that can help you now
is if that car is returned to me
in one piece.
And what that means...
is you still have a chance
to work something out...
Keep going.
A little further.
Oh, perfect, right there.
On three.
One...
two...
Aim for the vest.
...two and a half...
two and three quarters...
Now!
Shit!
Maybe it's out of bullets.
I think the trigger's stuck.
Where's the little gun?
I don't know.
- I'll got get some more bullets.
- Okay.
What do you think this does?
I don't know.
to the two children
who have stolen my vehicle,
this does not have to be
a felony offense.
Heck, it doesn't even have to be
a misdemeanor.
What?
If you do not know
how to use the radio, it's easy.
You just pick up the mic and you hold down
the little black button and you can talk.
And when you're through,
you let go and I can talk.
And no one else can hear.
This doesn't have to be...
I just want my car back.
- We should get out of here.
- Yeah, I'll go get the stuff.
- No.
- What?
I mean leave the car.
What? Why?
'Cause we're in big trouble.
We're not in trouble.
You're just too scared to drive
fast enough to get away from them.
I drive fast!
You... you don't drive fast. I saw you.
You were only going 35, pussy.
No, I'm not!
I was driving as fast as you.
Grandma's boy! Hey!
- Screw you!
- Don't push me!
I'm gonna leave and you can go to jail
when the cops get here.
I'm not going to jail.
Why not?
Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck! Oh!
Please don't kill me.
It wasn't our fault.
I'll do anything. I'll fucking do anything.
I'll... I'll fucking do anything.
Just don't kill me. Don't fucking kill me.
It wasn't... it wasn't our fault.
I told... I told him,
I said, "You're fucking up.
Please. Dude, we gotta do it now."
And he said, "No."
My brother, where's...
where's my brother, you fuck?
You... you fuck. You don't...
you fucked... you killed him.
Don't kill me. Don't kill me.
Don't kill me.
I'll fucking... I'll fucking...
Do it!
Do it!
Are you a bad guy?
I'm a good guy. I'm a good guy.
I'm a good... I'm a good guy.
- Then why are you tied up?
- No.
Because I...
I need someone to rescue me.
You boys are gonna rescue me, right?
Maybe.
You know who the bad guy is?
The sheriff.
He's a bad, bad guy.
Where is he?
Wait, hey. Hey, don't leave me in here!
Hey!
The fuck? Fuck, don't leave me!
- I think he's a good guy.
- Yeah, me, too.
Okay, let's let him out.
Listen up. We're gonna let you out, but you
gotta promise that you won't tell on us.
Of course. I swear.
You can't tell my grandma
or his mom or any of our teachers.
- Or my stepdad, Chris.
- I won't tell him.
I won't tell a soul.
Fuck.
This one's really tight.
- Yeah.
- I think you need to cut 'em, all right?
- Maybe we can shoot them off.
- No! No, no, no!
No, don't... don't... don't do that.
All right?
Hey, hey, come here. You know what?
I'm looking at you boys. You seem tough.
You probably... you must have a knife,
right? Maybe a pocket knife on you?
I had one, but it got tooken away
from me at school.
How about you? You got a knife?
Well, there must be something sharp
around here. Go on, take a look.
You, take a look. Yeah,
there might be something sharp in here.
Maybe later. We gotta go.
No, no, don't... please. I need you,
I need you. Look, this really hurts.
And if you don't get me out,
I might... I might die.
We can look.
Take a look. You can stay here.
Hey,
y'all best friends?
How old are you?
I'm so glad to see you boys
instead of that sheriff.
He's a really, really bad guy.
Believe me.
- I'm gonna hook you all...
- I found one.
The tweezers and the toothpick
are missing, but it's got the knife part.
That's great, that's great.
Come here, come here.
Get to cutting.
Listen, okay? You can't have
this cop car. It's our cop car.
We found it and we're not going
to let you have it, okay?
Deal. Don't worry, you can have it.
I don't care if I see another cop
car as long as I live. In fact...
I'm gonna give you boys
a whole bunch of money.
You like naked girls?
I'm gonna get you some Playboys.
And some... and some candy.
You like candy?
My friend and me have your car.
I'm real sorry.
We don't want... want to get in trouble,
but we don't know how to get back.
We're real scared.
We're out here all alo...
You boys sure had me.
Okay. All right.
All right, nothing to worry about now.
What's important is that
we get you boys home safe.
Now... you didn't touch
anything, did you?
A lot of dangerous equipment in my car.
You didn't open the trunk there, did you?
-
- Okay. That's good.
That's... that's good.
Now, this is what I want you to do.
I want you to set yourself in the backseat.
Don't touch anything. Anybody comes by,
you just say help is on the way.
You're doing a real special job
guarding the car for the sheriff.
- Do you understand?
-
Okay. All right.
Now...
you say that you don't know
how to get home.
Do you know where you are?
- What street you're on?
-
Well, take a look around.
You see any street signs?
-
- All right. Okay.
Well... well, the road that you're on,
is it a dirt road?
Good. Good.
Now tell me, is it a hilly road?
Is it a hilly road or is it a flat road?
-
- Okay. All right.
Now... now take a look around.
You see any houses?
Anything at all
that might help me find you?
A windmill.
Well...
that's great.
That's great. You know what?
I think I know where to find you.
What's your name, son?
Harrison.
And your little partner there,
what's his name?
Travis.
You boys did the right thing calling me.
You just sit tight. Help is on the way.
- In.
-
Stop fidgeting, you little shit!
That gun doesn't even work!
That's right.
Look.
He can't hear us.
What's he doing?
I don't know.
Maybe he's looking
to go to the bathroom.
I hate him.
I think he's trying to hide.
He sucks at hiding.
Why does he need both guns?
He's a gun hog.
Here he comes.
Where are we going?
Are we going home?
Hey!
This sucks.
Yeah, this...
fucking sucks.
Where'd he go?
He's hiding.
He's gonna shoot us.
Maybe he won't.
Okay.
Now, the man that owns this car is gonna
be here real soon. You understand?
And when he gets here, I need you boys
to do something for me. Okay?
You can't tell him where I'm hiding.
He can't even know I'm here.
- He's gotta think I'm still in the trunk.
- Why?
Shut up!
Just do what I said. Just keep quiet.
Because if you don't,
you know what I'm gonna have to do?
- Shoot us?
- No, I won't.
But what I will do is...
- You... you got a mom and dad?
- My grandma.
- You got a pet?
- A guinea pig.
- You?
- Snake and a dog.
- You live with your mom or dad?
- My mom and my stepdad.
What I'll do is go by your house.
And first I'll kill your dog.
I'll take a hammer, hit him in the head
until the hammer's covered in brains.
And then I'll take that snake of yours
and I'll slit him open top to bottom.
Then, your mom...
well, she'll probably have heard that
and she'll wonder, "What's going on?"
And when I see her,
you know what I'll do to her?
Shoot her in the face.
And your stepdad, too.
Make both their faces into ground beef.
And you...
I'll take that...
what you call it, guinea pig?
And I'll throw him against the ground
as hard as I can.
But that probably won't kill him.
And so while he's squirming
around down there, down in the dirt,
I'll stomp him with my boot.
Crush that guinea pig of yours.
And your grandma...
I'll slit her throat
with a big ol' knife.
And she'll scream for you
to "Come on and help me,"
but no sound will come out.
And you want to know why?
'Cause you can't scream
with a slit throat.
You understand?
So...
when the sheriff shows up looking
for his car, what are we gonna do?
Be quiet.
Great.
- You're eating a Slim Jim now?
- No. Look.
Next time he comes back,
you should shoot him.
Here he comes.
Shoot him.
Shoot him.
Shoot him.
Why didn't you shoot him?
You do it.
Should we tell?
What if this guy kills our families?
He just wants his car back.
I don't know.
Fuck! Fuck!
You boys sure gave me a fright.
Holy hell!
What do you say we get you home safe?
Okay, now you boys answer me, now.
Did you open up the trunk?
Was there somebody inside the trunk?
Did you open the trunk?
Did you open the trunk?
Did you open the trunk?
Did you open the trunk?
Did you open the trunk?
Boy, you answer me now...
or I will shoot you dead
right through this door.
Tell me right now...
where is he?
Son...
I am the only person out here
that you can trust.
I'm the only one that can help you.
Oh, fuck.
I knew it!
You little shits! I knew I wasn't crazy!
You think you can ride down this highway
and I won't know about it?
I know these roads like the back
of my hand! What's wrong with you?
Don't think you can play
dumb with me. I saw you.
You almost ran me off the road.
You are in so much trouble!
Get out of the car!
Hey! I'm talking to you!
Step outside the car.
Come on.
Get out! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- Ma'am.
- Are you okay?
I'm gonna need you to calm down.
I'm a police officer.
- Are you bleeding? I'm so...
- Ma'am!
- What?
- I'm gonna need you to stop talking.
- All right? All right?
- Okay. Okay.
- Just nod your head. Just nod.
- Okay.
- Just nod it at me.
- All right.
I've been injured by a perpetrator.
He is the father of the two boys
that are inside this vehicle.
You are okay.
He has fled the scene
and everything is okay,
but I'm gonna need
your help with something.
All right? Now listen up.
After I was attacked,
he threw my keys on the other side
of the road, way over there.
And what I'm gonna need you
to do is go ahead,
cross the road and see
if you can find my keys for me
so that I can radio for assistance.
You see, I cannot walk.
Do you understand?
Yeah.
Why don't I just call somebody
to come and get you?
No. No, no. No need to call.
Just head on over there
and see what you can find.
Go on.
- Go on.
- You okay?
Yeah.
- Go on.
- Okay.
Just take a good look around there.
It's gonna be hard to find them out here.
There's so much tumbleweed.
Cover as much ground as you can.
Yeah, and... just keep
your eyes peeled, okay?
- Okay?
- Okay!
Are you the woman that reported
the children driving the cruiser?
Yeah. Yeah, that was me.
Everyone said that I seen it wrong,
but I knew I saw them.
Well, you did a real good thing, ma'am.
It's... it's...
it's citizens like you that make
a difference in our community.
- Taking an active role.
- I don't see anything.
You didn't find anything?
Nothing at all?
Keep looking.
Oh, my God.
There's a man out there!
- Help!
- Help!
Help!
- Help!
- Help!
Help!
What time do you think it is?
I don't know.
I gotta go to the bathroom.
We have to go.
I think they're dead.
I was gonna try to shoot out the window.
Dang it, how do these work?
Let me try.
- Come on.
- Try like...
Try to smash the window with it.
Let me throw it.
If this would just...
- How'd you do that?
- I don't know!
My ears!
Wait!
I think something hit me.
You should've worn the bulletproof vest.
I know.
- Where's the lights?
- It's by the shifter thing.
It's not working.
It's okay. It doesn't hurt much anymore.
a fuckin'...
cop car!
We did it! Travis!
Take me home quick. Quick.
Hello?
