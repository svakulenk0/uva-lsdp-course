You've got all scratches all over your face.
Have you been fighting?

Well, what did he say about Dad?
I dort wanna say it, Mum.
It's disgusting.
Shaun, I want to know what he said.
I've been picked on three times today.
All because of my trousers.
What's wrong with your trousers?
Look at the fucking size of them!
Stop swearing.
There's nothing wrong with them.
- Your dad bought you them.

If you didn't want to wear them,
you should have put your school ones on.
It's non-uniform day, Mum.
What do you want me to do, Shaun?
I dort know what to do.
- We could move away.
- We can't move away.
We're not moving from anywhere.
We live here and we're staying here.
I dort like it here, Mum.
I liked it better when we were with Dad.
Well, I liked it better when we was with Dad,
but Dad's gone now.
Yes!
RADIO: Mrs Thatcher's visiting The Antrim
very close to two key events
in the War, for the ship.
Just over there,
in the Falklands Sound,
she was hit aft by a 1,0oolb bomb,
which, fortunately, didn't explode,
and there, on Fanning Head,
heavy bombardment from The Antrim
took out a key Argentine position.
Like the Army, the Navy is still taking
the threat of another Argentine attack
very seriously...
...as well as these Oerlikon guns,
the destroyer is armed...
...sea slug, sea cat...
What the fuck?
What do you want, Gadget?
You've just nearly put my window through.
: woody wants to know
if you're coming hunting.
Hunting? Why?
Because he feels sorry
for what happened the other day.
And he just wants to know
if you're coming out.
If I come, you're just gonna kick my head in
in the middle of a field.
woody said if I come within five feet of you,
he's gonna kick the shit out of me.
And why on earth
are you dressed like that?
We always dress like this.
You look stupid.
I know, but it's just a laugh that we have.
I've got you some stuff. Come on.
It's not a trick, is it, Gadget?
woody really wants me to come?
It's no trick, honest. Please?

GADGET: Give me a hand.

I'm happy for yous.
Are you all right?
Yeah.
You look a bit nervous.
I'm not gonna do anything
you dort want me to.
Have you ever done this before?
done it once.
In Germany.
In Germany?
Why did you go to Germany?
I was...
in Ger... Germany with my dad.
What did you do in Germany
with this girl?
Just kissed her.
Did you? Was she pretty?
Prettier than me?
- no way.
- Really?
Well, that's really cute of you.
do you want a kiss?
We'll leave it today.
You might look about four,
but you kiss like a forty-year-old.
You're dead sensitive.
Are you all right?
Are you sure?
do you want me to kiss you again?
do you wanna suck my tits?
- Tell 'em a story.
- All right, if yous are making me.
All right, it took a little bit of time.
- But we did end up running things.
- We certainly did.
I mean, it's just...
I mean, for three weeks, right,
this fucking wog...
Right? Proper horrible.
sorry, mate, sorry.
Didrt mean nothing by it.
You know, just slip of the tongue, like.
sorry. This, you know, this brown gentleman...
...who... he was a bully,
he was a horrible bully.
no matter what colour he was,
he was a bully.
- And I hate bullies. dort I, wood?
- Yeah.
I can't stand them, man.
I can't stand 'em.
But for three weeks, right,
this fella was robbing my pudding.
What kind of pudding was it?
doesrt matter what pudding it was.
The pudding's not the polnt.
The polnt is,
he was taking my pudding off me.
And I just thought,
"Nah, I'm not having it. I dort care.
You're not getting my pudding,
that's it."
so, I grabbed it and I've gone,
"no, mate, no, you're not having it."
He was like...
: "White boy...
Give me your pud-pud."
Proper! do you know what I mean?
And I've just thought, "no, man."
-
COMBO: Nah, he did, right.
ALL: Eh!
WOOD Y: Look at t'moosh on him.
- Smell his finger.
And who's been bloody smooching?
Come here, Shaun! Come on, man.
I've got someone I want you to meet.
Come and stand here.
now, listen to me.
This is a very special friend of mine.
Combo, Shaun.
Newest recruit.
Shaun. Combo.
What are you doing?
Just want to shake your hand.
Did you?
Are you a proper little skinead,
then, yeah?
Yeah.
You look like a little Action Man.
Like a little Barbie doII.
You're dressed up ar all that. Look.
What?
I'm only messing with you, you little fucker.
I'm only messing with you.
GADGET: He's all right.
- You're all right.
Nice one, lad.
Sit down, anyway, I'm telling a story.
Sit next to Milky.
Anyway, where was I?
What... Where was I?
You were on about that er...
"brown gentleman"
stealing your "pud-pud".
That's right, yeah. Yeah.
so, I've said, "no, you're not having it."
This one day, right,
I've been grafting all morning,
just shovelling shit, constantly,
all morning, non-stop.
Werert I? And I'm fucking starving.
# Gentle piano
You know, like that proper hunger.
And I'm thinking, "Right, just eat my pudding,
just go and eat my pudding."
I've just finished
the last fucking mouthful and then,
this big, black, sweaty hand
has just gone wallop, right in my pudding.
do you know what I mean?
Proper big cigar fingers,
all over my fucking crumble and custard...
I just thought,
"no, I'm not having it, I dort care.
You're not getting my pudding, that's it."
I just took his hand out and just looked
him right in the face and I've gone...
: woody.
so, last night was good fun, werert it?
- dort start.
- I'm just saying, a really good night.
I know what sort of a bloody night it was.
It were awkward.
It was er... a little on the tense side.
I know, mate, I'm sorry.
I knew he'd do it. I knew he'd have to
throw his bloody weight around.
Has to be number one.
He were like that before he went in.
nowt's frigging changed, at all.
Hang on. Wait.
He hardly did anything wrong, anyway.
- I thought he was all right.
- I've got an idea.
How about you climb out of his arse
for five minutes, Puke, eh?
Trust you to fucking jump on his dick.
I'm not. I'm just saying,
he was just telling a story.
You asked for a story, he toId it you.
I'll tell you a story
if you dort shut your mouth.
All right, boys?
- You all right, Combo?
- All right, Gadge.
- Puke.
- All right, mate.
WOOD Y: 'Ey up. What's up?
- Can I just have a little word with you?
- I've got a brew coming.
- Only be two minutes. Come 'ed.
- Bastard.
woody, dort be long cos I wanna get off.
- All right, love.
- Be two minutes, Lol.
All right, lad?
I said, "All right?"
What was that for? That hurt!
- woody, hurry up.
- I will, love, yeah.
Milky, I'd watch it.
I think summat's gonna kick off.
MILKY: dort worry. I'm more than ready.
You're making a big deal
out of nothing, anyway.
- He's all right.
- He's not.
Kel!
MILKY: Kelly, you dort even know him.
- What's up?
PUKEY: You all right, woods?
All right, lad.
- goon, then. What's happened?
- We've to...
We've to bob round tomorrow morning.
I tell you, I shouldrt be here, you know.
This dort feel good, at all.
Look at the size of that brew.
Who drinks a brew that big?
I bet you all thought I was a right fucking
horrible, horrible, horrible
little bastard the other day, didn't you?
- A little bit.
- A bit?
Tell the truth, wood, man.
I was fucking horrible, werert I?
- A bit of a bastard, man.
- Yeah.
Yeah, well, you were a snake.
You were a fucking serpent
from the Bible, werert you?
do you wanna know why, wood?
do you want me to tell you why?
Yeah?
Cos see that man, there, Milky?
That man there
took abuse off me.
And I said some horrible things, Milk,
and I'm fucking sorry.
You let me abuse him.
And what did you do?
What did you do, wood?
- I didn't do anything.
- I can't hear you.
- I didn't do nothing.
- Exactly. nothing. Fuck all.
Neither did any of yous.
not one of yous stood up
and made yourself count for that man there.
And that was fucking wrong.
Milk, honest to God,
I'm really glad you came here today.
And I mean that, mate,
I really mean that.
Cos I've got one question to ask you.
Just one question.
When you've heard it, if you want to leave,
you can leave, that's fine by me.
But I've got one question to ask you.
do you consider yourself
English or Jamaican?
English.
Lovely. I love you for that.
That's fucking great. I'm proud, man.
Learn from him.
That's a proud man, there.
That's what we need, man.
That's what this nation
has been built on.
Proud men. Proud fucking warriors.
Two thousand years,
this little tiny fucking island
has been raped and pillaged
by people who have come here
and wanted a piece of it.
Two fucking world wars,
men have laid down their lives for this.
For this, and for what?
so we can stick our fucking flag
in the ground and say,
"Yeah, this is England
and this is England
and this is England."
And for what?
For what now?
Eh, what for?
so we can just open the fucking floodgates
and let them all come in?
And say, "Yeah, come on, come in.
Get off your ship. Did you have
a safe journey? Was it hard?
Here y'are, here's a corner,
why dort you build a shop?
Better still, why dort you build a shop
and then build a church?
Follow your own fucking religions.
do what you want."
When there's single fucking parents
out there, who can't get a fucking flat
and they're being given to these...
And I'm gonna say it,
cos you're gonna have to fucking hear it.
We're giving the flats
to these fucking Pakis. Right?
Who've got 50 and 60
in a fucking flat on their own.
Right? We're giving that to them.
There's three and a half million
unemployed out there.
Three and a half million of us,
who can't find fucking work.
Cos they're taking them all.
Cos it's fucking cheap labour.
Cheap and easy labour.
Fucking cheap and easy,
which makes us cheap and easy.
Three and a half fucking million!
It's not a j0ke. It's not a fucking j0ke.
And that Thatcher sits there
in her fucking ivory tower
and sends us on a fucking phoney war!
The Falklands?
The fucking Falklands?
What the fuck's The Falklands?
Fucking innocent men,
good fucking strong men.
Good soIdiers,
real people losing their lives,
going over there thinking
they're fighting for a fucking cause.
What are they fighting for?
What are they fighting against?
Fucking shepherds!
Shepherds with fucking...
Shut up about The Falklands.
- Why?
- Cos I want you to.
There's fucking loads of dickheads dying
out there for nothing.
My fucking dad werert a dickhead!
What are you doing?
- Fuck off! Shut up!
- What am I doing wrong?
Whoa, there, little one.
What's wrong, mate?
- Tell me the truth. Come on.
- I just fucking...
That's it. goon.
My fucking dad died in that war!
- Your dad died?
- Yeah. Get off!
- Fucking hell, mate, I'm sorry.
- Fucking shut up about it!
I'm sorry, mate.
Fucking hell, I'm sorry, lad.
I'm sorry. I never knew he died, man.
Fucking hell.
Oh, look, mate, if I'd have known,
honest, I wouldrt have said, man,
but what I'm telling you is the truth.
I can't lie to you.
It's a pathetic war, man.
And you want your dad's life
to mean something, dort you?
And this breaks my fucking heart to say it.
We shouldrt have been there.
She lied to us.
She lied to me. She lied to you.
But, most importantly, she lied to your dad.
If you dort stand up and fight this fucking fight
that's going on on the streets,
your dad died for nothing.
He died for nothing.
You've got to carry it on, man, in here.
In your little fucking heart,
you've got the pride of your dad, man.
Fucking hell.
That little fucking whippersnapper
has set the standard.
- Can you believe that, Banj?
- You can't, can you, at that age?
Fucking hell.
What a gem.
What a fucking gem.
All right, look.
There's the line, boys.
That means
you're all quite welcome to just leave
and leave now and never come back
and that's it, the end of it.
But if you wanna stay,
this is a proper fight.
now yous all either cross that line
and go your merry little way...
...or you stay where you are
and you come with me.
The choice is yours, boys.
Fucking hell!
That was a bit quick, werert it?
I ain't being fucking brainwashed, Combo.
Oh, listen to fucking Sigmund Vold there.
You're well out of line.
Well out of line, man.
Come on, lads, let's have you.
Come on, then.
Come on, Puke, mate.
Sit down.
You what?
Kes, just sit down.
no. no, you can't be serious, mate.
We'll talk about this outside.
Kes, just sit down.
Puke, man, fucking come.
What you on about?
Look, he's fucking right.
What can I do, man? Are you coming?
no.
- Gadge, come on, Tubs, man.
- Fuck off calling me Tubs!
I'm sick of you, woody.
This is why I'm staying,
because you're always taking the piss,
making me feel that fucking big.
He's put things into perspective.
Look at the other night.
You didn't step up once then.
Joln me.
Milky, man,
I know I let you down the other night,
but I swear to you
I'll never fucking do it again. Look at me.
I'd never do it again.
I swear to God I wouldrt, man.
You're my br0, man. What the fuck?
Come on, mate.
WOOD Y: Shaun? Come on, man. We're off.
LOL: Come on, Shaun.
- no.
Shaun, man, you can't fucking stay here.
Shaun?
He's just a kid. The things you've said
have made him want to stay.
woody, I wanna make my dad proud.
Listen, love...
See you later, mate.
See you later, Lol, love.
He's 12. I can't leave him here.
- go.
- nothing we can do if he wants to stay.
You fucking look after him, do you hear me?
He can look after himself. He's proved that.
COMBO: See yous later.
Come on, love.
Come on, now.
See you later, mate.
dort forget, you've got a snake
in the grass with you there.
You're a good man.
A brave good man, man.
A really good man.
A cup of tea for the boys there, Banj.
Few Pot noodles or something.
I'm fucking gagging for a shit, me,
I'm telling you.
dort worry about it.
I'll have a word with woody.
I'll sort it, I promise you.
I just feel really bad.
He looked gutted, Combo.
I know, I feel bad, as well, but...
Oh, fucking hell, let's face it.
woody's not like me and you.
no, he's fucking certainly not like you.
no-one's ever fucking took a swing at me
like that.
- Really?
- Honest.
Honest.
It's like looking in the mirror.
taking swings at big men.
I dort know, I just dort like
people speaking about my dad,
even in a nice way.
I dort even like people
speaking about the war.
You loved him, didn't you?
Yeah.
And then you lost him.
: Yeah.
I know what it's like.
to have people walk out on you.
to have people just fucking leave you.
Honest, lad, I know how you feel.
If you ever want anyone to talk to...
...someone to cry with
or just to fucking have a hug
or punch the fuck out of 'em,
I'm telling you, I'll be there for you.
I wort turn my back on you.
I promise you that.
Spit.
That's a mars handshake, that.
I promise you.
I wort let you down.

- Look at the size of that dog.
- Gadge, have a look at that dog.
- Just get on with it.
Excuse me, mate,

Ah, my arse is killing.

- Round the back.
- Round the back.
- Cheers, boss.
I am hungry, yeah.
There should be a barbecue or something.
Buffet food...

ARTHUR: You all right?
How are you, Arthur? Good to see you.
All right, Lenny, mate.
All right? A pleasure. A pleasure.
SHAUN: All right, mate.
LENNY: Gentlemen, there is a forgotten word.
no.
An almost forbidden word.
A word that means more to me
than any other.
That word is "England".
MEN: Yes!
Once, we flaunted it in the face of the world,
like a banner.
It was a word that stood for power.
A word that stood for freedom.
A word that stood for respect.
But today,
we're scarcely even allowed
to speak the name of our country.
Gadge, are you honestly...
Well, I want to revive that word,
a grand old word,
the word "Englishman".
ALL: Yes! Yes!
Yes!
now we've been marginalised.
We've been called "cranks".
We're not cranks.
some people say we're racists.
We're not racists. We're realists.
some people call us Nazis.
We're not Nazis.
no, what we are, we are nationalists.
And there's a reason
people try to pigeonole us like this.
And that is because of one word, gentlemen.
- Fear.
ALL: Yeah.
They fear us.
They fear us because we are the true volce
of the people of this country.
- Yes!
COMBO: Yes, Lenny.
People who work hard,
pay their way,
it dort matter
what their ethnic background is,
I welcome with open arms in this country.
It's the people who think
we owe them a living.
These are the people that need to go back.
ALL: Yes!
Send them back!
- Send the bastards back!
- Send them back!
Send them back!
An English king on a battlefield once said,
"From this day till the end of the world,
only we in it shall be remembered,
we few, we happy few,
we band of brothers."
Gentlemen, it is the time to stand up
and be counted.
ALL: Yes!
- It is the time for action.
Our country has been stolen
from under our noses.
ALL: Yes!
Well, gentlemen,
it's time to take it back!
Yes!
Yes! goon, Lenny! goon, Lenny!
Are you ready to return to the fight?
ALL: Yes!
- Are you ready to shed blood?
ALL: Yes!
Are you ready to fight for this country
with your last breath of life?
ALL: Yes!
: Lenny! Lenny! Lenny!
Lenny! Lenny...
Gentlemen, joln our band of brothers.
Sign up today.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Yes!
I'm going to have a word with Lenny.
Yous wait here.

PUKEY: Fucking, Gadge.

do you not feel bad about woody?
What do you mean,
do I not feel bad about him? Look.
Look at all these people in here.
This is right.
If it wasrt right,
all these wouldrt be here.
- Think about...
- I'm not saying that.
do you not feel bad
about just leaving him like that?
- He's been our mate for...
- We've not left him.
I'm still his friend.
MEGGY: Comb...
You know, you're supposed to have
a qualified driver in the front.
Are you gonna fucking report me?

Can one of us come up the front?
Shall we show him?
Shall we show him?

the middle of the wall, back in the flat.
We'll build all our stuff round that.
That's gonna be our fucking centrepiece.
That's the focus.
- Glad you like it.

MEGGY: What's it called, that flag?
St George's Cross, isn't it, Combo?
Yeah. St fucking George's Cross.
You all right there, Pukes, lad?

MEGGY: If only you knew.
Happy birthday, Smell.
- Smell!
- What's that?
Porno?
What are you giving her porno for,
Meggy?
She's a woman.
She's got her own nipples.
I thought she might like it.
Smell, are you ready?
The er... magicians.
- Are you ready?

SHAUN AND COMBO:
Three... two... one.
BOTH: Alakazam! Yeah!

Wahey!
Happy birthday, Smell.

- Happy birthday.
- Thanks.

- Yeah, please.
- Here you are. Put that on the table.
- Cheers, love, thanks.
You dort mind us coming, do you, Smell?
It's just...
My little man, here, wanted to surprise you
on your birthday and all that.
Happy birthday, Smell.
do you think my party's going all right?
It's been all right, yeah.
Better if woody was here.
Yeah, I know, man.
I dort know why they left.
They just kind of got up and went.
I dort think woody was standing
any of it from Combo.
I mean, I dort know what's going on
with those two,
but there's some real tension.
I can sense some real tension
between them.
Was you happy when you saw me?
Yeah.
I liked it when you gave me that cake.
I thought it was cool.
Did you make it?
Yeah.
- You didn't, did you?
- no.
I didn't think you did.
Did you buy it?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, you bought it.
But what did you think to the other night?
Yeah.
do you know what I'm on about?
In the shed and stuff.
Yeah, that was...
It was all right, yeah.
Did you not think much to it?
Oh, yeah.
It was really nice.
You know when I asked you
to suck my tits and stuff,
I just thought
that you werert that into it.
I only didn't suck your tits
cos I've never done it before.
I thought you'd seen a pair of tits
in Germany or summat.
no, I've seen a pair of tits, but...
I didn't suck 'em.
Oh.
Right.
That's why then, isn't it?
It's not cos you didn't want toor anything?
Yeah, I just...
Cos I bet you've had
loads of boys doing it and...
I felt a bit embarrassed
just in case I couldrt do it.
Yeah.
not that many people have done it to me.
I just thought it'd be nice, like.
It'd make us feel closer and stuff.
I was...
meaning to ask you.
This might seem a bit daft,
but will you be my girlfriend?
Honestly?
Yeah, I'd love to be.
It'd be really nice.
Cos I've been thinking about it, as well,
but I didn't think you'd ever ask me.
I thought it'd just be, like, a one time,
off in the shed or whatever.
Will you be all right for...
them lot to know,
if you're not embarrassed?
Cos I'm not embarrassed.
I think you're lovely.
MARGARET THATCHER: To maintain peace,
with freedom and justice is always expensive.
It's less expensive than war,
particularly in human life.
Might there be a time when we talk
to the Argentines again?
No. Not on sovereignty.
One thing... the islanders
have made it perfectly clear,
these islands are British.
They are the Queers loyal subjects.
They wish it to stay that way.
At least the weather's been on
Mrs Thatcher's side...
- Lol.
- For fuck's sake.
Where are you off? Court?
no. I...
- What do you want?
- I wanna talk to you.
- Well, I'm late for work.
- Just two minutes?
- I haven't got two minutes.
- All right, Lol?
- You all right?
- Yeah.
- Hi, Lol.
- Hiya.
For fu... I'm going to work.
- Please, Lol. Two minutes.
- What do you wanna talk to me about?
- Stuff.
- Stuff?
- You wanna talk to me about stuff?
- I just wanna have a chat with you.
About the fact you've just
come out of prison?
You've ruined everything?
You've br0ken woody's fucking heart?
You wanna talk to me about stuff?
Well, I can't fucking wait. Let's go.
I want to talk about other stuff.
Other stuff? What other stuff
have you possibly got to say to me?
Could I just have fucking two minutes
with you?
no, I'm going to work.
I'm not your fucking counsellor, Combo.
- I'll come back at dinner time, then.
- no, dort come back.
I'll come to yours later on.
to mine?
You can have two minutes now.
You've got two fucking minutes.
OK. Sound.
Come on, then. I'm late for work.
There's something for you
in the glove box.
A box.
You make this when you was in prison?
Yeah.
Thanks.
Lol...
Erm...
Since that night that we spent together,
before I went inside...
...I haven't been able to think about
anything else.
no, I haven't.
I haven't been able
to get you out of my mind, man.
And, to be honest with you, Lol...
...just thinking of you...
...got me through
them three and a half years inside.
I mean...
That was the best night of my life.
It was the worst night of my life.
Why?
I have done nothing but try and forget
about that night, Combo.
It was... It was beautiful.
no, I was 16.
I was pissed off my head.
It wasrt beautiful.
I love you, Lol.
What?
I've...
I've always loved you.
It's never gonna happen, Combo.
Are we done?
Yeah.
There's your box.
# TOOTS AND THE MAYTALS:
Pressure Drop
# Pressure
# Oh, pressure
# Pressure's gonna drop on you
Why do they call you Smell?
It's kind of similar to Michelle,
if you think about it.
I dort know, really,
if I'm being honest with you.
- Ah, that's fine.
- It's not cos I'm smelly.
It's just Michelle and Smell.
- Right.
- Purely cos it rhymes.
Well, it sort of rhymes, doesrt it?
does it rhyme?
MEGGY: R for Rectum.
Rabbit.

Furry rectum.

- Yeah, probably.
- Really?
- Yeah, probably.
- Oh, I hope so.
Let's bang some music into their ears.
That'll be good.

- Yeah, I can walk straight in.
Combo!
That was nice, that was.
MILKY: Yeah, well, you know.

MILKY: Oh, fuck.

You know how it is, having a bit of fun.
What's up, mate?
You look down.
One of them days.
You know what I mean?
Look, man, erm...
Any chance you can get me any weed?
I just want a sm0ke.
You know what I mean?
I mean, I've only got, like,
one spliff left on me.
I can't really give that away.
- What were you after?
- About an ounce or summat.
Fucking hell.

I couldrt get anything like that big, no way.
I mean, I'll give you half, I'll split it.
Give you half of it.
Well, I mean, I might be able to...
...to get... get like that much.
What?
What?
I thought you were gonna
walk me home.
You can be there in, like, 15 minutes,
if you get a move on now.
You're only a mile down the road.
Are you j0king?
What?
Oh, fuck you, you selfish bastard.
Fuckir hell, man.
BOTH: women!
SMELL: Ooh-ooh-ooh!
Watch it.

Wait for it.

SMELL: I'm not making tea.
GADGET: Kick donkey, Kick donkey...
Anyone got a problem?

Good to see you, Milk.
Are you all right, mate?
All right, Tubbs.
Is woody on his way?
no. Just Milky.
- All right, Milks?
- Are you all right, mate?
no problem.
Sit down, Milks.
That's good.
That means we can all get stoned.
# At the dark end...
A chocolate bassline.
# Of the street...
GADGET: All velvet.
# That's where we always meet...
Combo. My dancing buddy.
# Hiding in shadows
# Where we dort belong
# Living in darkness
to hide our wrong...
# You and me...
Sit, Mitzy, sit.
# At the dark end of the street...
I'm hot, I'm hot!
# You and me...
Ow!
# I know time's gonna take its toII...
Are you all right, Gads?
# We have to pay for the love...
Take him home, love. He looks fucked.
# It's a sin and we know...
It's all right, Gadge, lad.
Have you fucking seen how white he is!
I've never seen anyone
look that fucking sick!
That fucking kid's arse went white!
#... steal away...
Come on.
# to the dark end
# Of the street...
Oh, man.
Here you are.
no, seriously, Combo, man.
I've got to tell you, mate,
you're a good geezer, man.
Seriously. I mean, this... this music,
this sort of music is the sort of stuff
that I listen to, my uncles listen to.
Yeah, to me, this is good music.
What you've gotta remember, Milks,
right, is... is I'm an original skinead.
'69, me.
But it was people like your uncle,
your uncle that introduced that stuff to me.
The soul of that music
just fucking resonated within us,
do you know what I mean?
And it's people... it's skineads, like you,
true skineads, like you,
keeping that flame alive.
Yeah. It was fucking unity.
It was black and white, together.
Know what I mean?
It should not be forgotten.
It shouldrt die.
You're still flying that flag in that fucking
get-out that you're wearing.
It's proper.
It's real, man.
Oh, man.
That's it, man,
we're like brothers now. Yeah?
Serious.
- For life.
- Yeah, for life.
Nice one, Combo.
Hand the spliff over.
I haven't had a laugh like this
for fucking years.
- Serious.
- For years.
Here you are. It's been a long time.
I want some chocolate.
- There's biscuits in the cupboard.
- not in that cupboard.
no, not in that cupboard. I'm starving!
How can you fucking live like this?
There's not even a mouldy Twiglet.
I'm really starving, man.
I've got the munchies badly.
- Combo, have you eaten the biscuits?
- no.
- Fucking hell.
MILKY: What a night.
so, how many uncles have you got?
Erm...
I've got three uncles and two aunties.
so, a big family, then.
Yeah.
I've got... What is it? 22 cousins.
One uncle's got, what, seven kids.
What, to the same woman, like?
Nah.
Spread out
between three different women.
One's got two, the other's got two,
and another one's got three kids.
And he just, like,
left these families and fucked off?
Nah, he still sees 'em.
Yeah, to me,
he still spends time with them.
They're always round at Christmas
and stuff like that. We all get together.
A big party till late in the morning.
Yeah, it's... it's nice.
It is. It's nice having a big family.
Have you got a mum and dad?
Cos you haven't talked about
your mum or dad.
Yeah, I've got a mum and dad.
Of course, man.
A good mum and dad.
Yeah, I can't knock 'em at all.
I was one of them kids where...
my dad was away all the time.
sometimes he was away for, like,
a fortnight, working.
But...
I never blamed my dad or anything
like that for him being away and working.
Cos...
there was always food on that table.
That's what I respect that man for.
Always.
Lucky you, aren't you?
I tell you...
you know, any, any time...
...you wanna come round
for something to eat,
you have to come to my grandma's
to get something to eat.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, man.
She'll cook some rice.
She'll cook some peas.
She'll cook some chicken.
She sounds dead lovely, dort she?
Serious, man, then you come home
for some ackee and swordfish.
That'd be nice, wouldrt it?
Ah, seriously, man, cos...
I'd love for you to do that.
I'd love for you to do that. That'd be nice.
Serious, come and see how we...
how we live. Know what I mean?
Even on a bad day,
there'll probably be...
a couple of my uncles
and about seven...
Fucking hell.
You've got everything, haven't you?
- What?
- You've got the whole lot.
You've got the whole fucking
perfect package.
Fucking hell.
Got everything, you, didn't you?
Fucking hell, man. so...
What... What do you think
makes a bad dad?
I dort know, mate. I'm not a dad, am I?
I know you had a good dad, like, but,
be honest with me, what do you really think
makes a bad dad, though?
I dort know, man.
What's with the questions, man?
I feel like I'm being interr0gated.
What do you reckon?
Niggers.
- What's with the "nigger"?
- Because you are, aren't you?
You're a fucking nigger. Arert you?
Arert you?
