They may call it
something else,
like the stock market,
or real estate.
If you're risking somethin,
you're gambling.
Hey.
...then I'm the guy
you want to see.
Do you ever
follow up a mistake
with another
wretched mistake?
I hate the expression
"I hear you."
Because what it usually means
is, "I'm ignoring you."
But, Professor Hornstein,
I hear you.
It's just that
I was planning
on taking my wife skiing in
Vermont on break, and now...
And now, the online sports
book has your money.
The poker site
has some of it, too.
I was hoping, perhaps, you
could get it back for me.
I can't get you back
what I don't have.
I gave you a coupon for
discounted play on the site.
You used it.
Lost. That's it.
You got all the answers,
don't you?
Of course you do.
Okay.
Professor, you ever heard
of Rush Street Capital?
Yeah.
I worked there.
One year away from becoming
a Portfolio Manager
and a seven-figure bonus
when the meltdown happened
and the firm blew up.
But I learned
two things from it.
Hard work alone doesn't
protect your downside
and nobody plays
for free.
MALE TV ANCHOR 1: What do
college campuses have in common
with Las Vegas
and Atlantic City?
Gambling is now so prevalent
among college students,
it's creating serious problems
with few easy answers.
MALE TV ANCHOR 2: Worldwide, online
gambling has reached epidemic proportions.
ANDERSON COOPER ON TV: Four years
ago, the big Nevada casinos
thought of online gaming
as the competition.
Now, they're realizing that with
their brand name recognition,
they can maybe get a big
piece of the online action.
FEMALE TV ANCHOR 1: With access to high-stakes
gambling just a mouse click away,
teenagers are the latest group
to fall into the gambling web.
MALE TV ANCHOR 3: With
reports of revenue in excess
of thirty billion
dollars a year.
MALE TV ANCHOR 4: Anyone
with access to the Internet
can gamble away
their life savings
without stepping foot
out of their home.
FEMALE TV ANCHOR 2: Department

his opponent's han.
MALE TV ANCHOR 6: Department
of Justice officials announce

and continues to
operate outside

in Costa Rica.
FEMALE TV ANCHOR 3: With no
legal recourse whatsoever.
RICHIE: At Princeton,
you're either bred for it
And I can't seem
to stop bleeding.
MONROE: My general
concern, Mr. Furst,
is that you are promoting
gambling on campus.
My more pressing concern,
the one expressed to me
by Mr. Arnaud's father
is that you are
encouraging Paul to gamble.
You told
your dad that, Paul?
It's his credit card.
MONROE: The point is,
Mr. Furst,
Mr. Arnaud did not send his
boy 3,500 miles from home
in order to start him
on the road to perdition.
You are supposed to be earning
your Masters of Finance
and serving as a graduate
teaching assistant.
Instead, you are running
some kind of virtual casino.
Gambling is forbidden
on campus.
Bookmaking is forbidden
on campus.
And if you don't
change your tune,
you're going to be forbidden
on campus as well.
Now, if you'll excuse us,
I'll finish with Mr. Furst alone.
Paul. Thanks, man.
Looked at your transcripts.
Spoke to your professors.
Even read some
of your papers.
You have a real gift.
I want you to make
this place proud.
But you've got your hands in
your fellow students' pockets.
I've never stolen
anything from anyone.
Dean, I'm not eligible
for financial aid
because my past
income is too high.
But that money
is basically gone.
I owe $21,000 tuition,
due next week.
Sixty-grand, total, before I get
my degree. And that's if I don't eat.
Welcome to
the real world.
It doesn't mean you can
live by your own rules.
I'm not a bookie, okay?
My official title is
"Affiliate for Online Gaming."
I steer traffic to the website,
they pay me a commission.
Hands off.
Arm's length.
I get a small fee for
each player I sign up.
I'm not living some
elaborate lifestyle, here.
It's how I'm paying my way
through this university.
What we touch touches us,
too, Mr. Furst.
Dean, I'm in marketing.
As am I.
And what I market
is this university.
You will close up shop,
effective immediately,
or you won't have
a school to pay for.
RICHIE: The thing about
this game is you can't wn
unless you're ready
to risk it all.
That is a lot of
your bankroll in play.
All of it, Craigger.
What do you say, we shut
it down real quick?
It must be really nice
to have your education paid for,
but the rest of us still have
to grind for our Masters.
Is your plan just to gamble
for your tuition money?
Whoa, whoa, it's not like
I'm shooting craps
or playing blackjack
or something.
You're playing poker,
Richie.
I'm playing poker against fish, Craig.
It's a big difference.
And $17,000 means
zero to me right now.
This is my shot, okay?
And statistically, it's the right play.
Look, I've been
three-tabling.
I find a guy on the fourth,
who's acting like it's his life's
mission to give all his money away.
Hold up.
Why did you just raise?
Non-weighted game theory.
Because it'll outperform the EV of
flatting and he'll spaz in anyway.
Look. See his starting hands
and betting patterns?
This guy is
a weak player.
This is the type of sucker
you find once a year, maybe.
Okay, what are we at?
Fifty.
Fifty. Fantastic.
Hey, Richie, it's me, Craig.
I'm a very good friend of yours.
You cracked 50?
What do you say
you just pull back
some of that cake?
Fifty doesn't get me
to graduation, Craig.
What did I tell you?
This is the one you wait for.
No, no, no, you gotta be kidding me.
How did you know to fold?
We got the next one.
Here we go, baby.
Richie, let's go.
Stay in it.
Come on,
don't bet at that. Fold!
Shit, how did you know
to bet at that?
RICHIE: If you're a poker
player, a real poker player,
there is no
such thing as luck.
Richie, you got
to stop, man.
I can't let short-term variance slow me down.
That's the sucker play.
This guy plays too bad
for me to stop.
RICHIE: If you lose over the
long term, there is a reason.
And this guy was too bad
to be the reason.
He never showed his card,
he'd just raise or fold.
Raising when I was weak,
folded when I was trapping.
That's not good,
that's great.
When you get beat straight-up,
it hurts like hell.
it's a fucking dagger
in the eye.
LIONEL: You were right.
See this right here?
This is way outside
the norm.
I knew it. That's why
I brought it to you.
I compared it against
thousands of players, right?
Look how far outside the normal win
rates the guys who beat you are.
What's that, like, over a million to one?
Dude, it's like winning
Powerball four times in a row.
HARRY: Richie?
What the hell?
Christ, I haven't seen you
in what? Four years?
RICHIE: I don't know, Dad.
I stopped counting.
You stopped counting,
I count.
You, uh, got a minute?
Oh, yeah.
Come in, sit down.
What the hell are you doing here?
Are you okay?
I'm fine.
What do you need?
Have you got any connections
in Costa Rica?
Why? Are you going down
to Costa Rica?
Are you gonna gamble?
Are you a chip off the old block now?
No, I'm not.
I always thought you
were an action guy.
I'm not looking to gamble.
Oh.
Well, what then?
I was hoping you knew somebody who
could get me close to Ivan Block.
No. I don't know
anybody like that.
That's out of my league.
Way out.
He started that site, and
he had a dozen competitors.
I know. You're sure?
There's nobody from all
the years at the tables?
No, there's nobody.
All the chits are going
the other way now, son.
Now, wait a minute.
Where the hell are you going?
Come on. Stick around,
play a little bit.
RICHIE: Here.
CRAIG: Richie. Richie, you're
not even listening to me.
Richie, what about
finals, huh?
I got extensions.
Okay, but
where are you going?
Costa Rica.
Costa Rica.
Did you get your shots?
Because there
are monkeys there.
Monkeys that bite
you with disease.
Odds are, the monkeys will
be the least of my worries.
Do you have any idea
how crazy this is?
Look, Block is
a businessman.
It's bad business
to defraud your customer.
If anything,
I'm doing the guy a solid.
CRAIG: "A solid." This isn't
about Block, though.
It's about you.
You don't know how to lose.
You ever heard of Meyer Lansky?
Yes, I know Meyer Lansky.
Right. One thing
he wouldn't allow
is a bent table
at any of his casinos.
Every flip, every spin, every
roll of the dice had to be legit.
Because he understood
what gambling is about.
So, what's gambling all about?
Everybody gets a fair shot.
Whether you have one dollar
on the line or a million.
Let's think this through
for a second.
You're about to jet off to a
country you've never been to,
with a language
you do not speak,
bluff your way into
Ivan Block's posse,
somehow call him out in front
of everybody he knows,
and you expect him to just give
you your money back and say,
"Oh, that's my bad, dude.
My fault."
This school, this degree,
what that means in the world...
Mmm.
This isn't my second chance, Craig.
This is my last chance.
Welcome to Costa Rica.
RICHIE: There are hundreds
of affiliates already
down here for
the gaming convention.
And they run the gamut.
From the guys with all the money
Hey, hoss.
If you're looking to gamble
in your hotel room later.
I'm all right, man.
You're Pet!
I'm Richie Furst.
I steer players
to your sites.
Richie. Dude.
Andrew C.
Hey, Richie F.
Nice to meet you.
Are you here for the expo?
Yeah, I'm hoping to get face
to face with Ivan Block.
Do you know him?
The man is like
the Wizard of fucking Oz.
And no one gets
behind the curtain.
No one.
All right, man. We gotta go.
Take it easy.
Good luck.
Yeah, you too.
We understand
you're homesick.
IVAN: It's not
that I'm homesick.
I'm not away at camp.
It's an issue
of freedom.
You know what Napoleon said he missed
the most when he was in exile in Elba?
Pussy.
You know what
he missed second?
Paris.
Now, myself, I don't
give a fuck about Paris.
And I got a whole grip
of pussy down here.
But I can't walk down
Michigan Avenue.
I can't walk down Broadway.
I can't walk down
Art Rooney Avenue
and have a Primanti's
Kolbassi and cheese.
You know what that's like
for a lifelong Steelers fan?
TOWEL: I can only imagine.
We can raise it
in committee.
The table's ready.
Who's first?
Okay.
Look, guys, we all know
what's going on.
You're about to get
the kind of blowjob
your wife hasn't
given you in 30 years.
And that's great.
I want to help our vaunted
leaders let off a little steam.
That's why we're lucky,
because you got me down here.
Enjoy your massage.
MALE ANNOUNCER: Welcome, affiliates,
to the 2013 Midnight Black Expo.
Please join us poolside
for poker and blackjack.
Affiliates, please go to the lower
deck to redeem your vouchers.
Super affiliates, please meet in the
poker pavilin on the lower level.
Five minutes. I'm just looking
for five minutes with Mr. Block.
And I'm looking to be on
the cover of Italian Vogue
but it's not gonna happen
for either of us.
It could.
Maybe for me.
Why don't you
give me your card?
I'll put you on
the call list.
Oh.
Triage this for me,
best you can.
Great dress,
by the way.
Thank you.
You're gonna have to like it
because I'm gonna be in it
for the rest of the night.
No time to breathe,
much less to change.
I know. I'm buried with party
requests for tomorrow night.
REBECCA: It's going
to be amazing.
I've just been over all
the details with Ivan.
Excuse me, Ms. Shafran?
Oh, God, I haven't been called that
since the last time I was deposed.
It brings back bad memories.
It's Rebecca.
Rebecca,
I'm Richie Furst and...
You smell like
an affiliate.
Not anymore.
But you want something.
Okay, so there's a couple of
ways I could respond to that.
I could say "yes,"
and you walk away.
I could say "no," but then
you'd know I was lying.
And I walk away.
But you haven't
walked away yet.
Don't try to con me.
Just tell me straight up
what you want.
Okay.
I need to come to that
party tomorrow night.
There. How easy was that?
Hey, you!
Get down. Now.
RICHIE: All right, fellas.
GUARD: Let's go.
Is this the guy?
Okay, you got in.
What do you want?
My name is Richie Furst.
I was cheated on your
site, Midnight Black,
and I'm guessing by the look on
your face you don't even know it.
If I had a dollar for every bad
gambler who lost money on my site,
and turned around and claimed they
got cheated, I wouldn't need a site.
Mr. Block, I ran a multimodal
sample distribution
at the Plasma Physics Lab
at Princeton.
These numbers
are negative-3 sigma.
That means they fall substantially
below the standard deviation.
I could have gone to the
Internet forums, chat rooms,
exposed the whole thing,
but I didn't.
I brought it to you.
Well, I appreciate that.
Thank you very much.
Have a good night.
Sir?
Hey. Come on aboard.
It's not gonna
make you sick, is it?
No, no, no.
I'm fine.
Good.
I'm a big believer
in being the person
who kills what
they eat, you know?
The Indians had
that figured out.
And not a whole
hell of a lot else
until the casino racket
in the mid '80s.
Let's try this part again.
My name's Ivan.
Richie Furst.
It's a pleasure, Richie.
Welcome aboard.
I never in a million years thought
I'd have something like this.
Just got to the point where me and
my old partner, Alex Maynard,
looked in the ATM account and
realized we had so much money
that it was morally incumbent
on us to buy something.
So, we ordered
a set of these boats.
We had a good time.
A lot of fun.
Is he still involved?
No. Alex, um...
You know, this life
has a lot of temptation.
And it just gets
a hold of some people.
Alex died of a drug overdose a
little more than three years ago.
He was a good guy.
He was my...
He was my best friend.
Because the house
always wins.
Which is why we don't
have to cheat people.
We have the greatest
business model in the world.
a second, average rake.
That's just poker, okay?
The rest of the site we're doing
$1.2 to $1.9 million a day.
That translates into
$750,000 net profit per day.
But the math is right.
Am I missing something?
No, you didn't
miss anything.
We missed something.
We had a couple
of our programmers
who decided
it would be a good idea
to write a backdoor
into the code
so that they could
see player's hole cards.
And they cheated you.
And they cheated
other players.
And I'm really sorry
and I'm embarrassed.
And that has nothing
to do with what
this company
and what this site stand for.
You saw it.
The donkeys in Compliance
missed it.
This is why
they're on airplanes
to wherever the fuck donkeys
from Compliance come from.
But you came to me.
You didn't tell
anybody else.
Because you know rumors
of cheating and bullshit
can affect these sites
like fucking bedbugs
and you can never
get rid of it.
That took a lot of balls.
Honestly, I couldn't get
to you any other way.
Regardless,
I'm very grateful.
I am nothing if not world-class
at showing my gratitude
so we have checked you in
to one of our company's
executive luxury
penthouse suites
and your account
has been credited
with the amount of
money that you lost.
I don't know what to say.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Just do me a favor
and don't try to win
your tuition
online again, okay?
How do you know
about that?
How do you think
I know?
Studying my player history,
ran it through your algorithm,
saw that I was playing
way above my mean.
No, none of that shit.
We bribed your roommate,
Craig.
Look, Richie, I understand
why you did what you did.
I know about what happened
with that job on Wall Street.
You were trying to get rich, and
you were trying to be respectable.
And you would have, if you
had another year and a half.
Those people
took your labor...
And my fucking money.
And your fucking money,
and they burned it all up.
And now you're fucked.
Because Wall Street's a different place.
The rules have changed.
The odds of getting a job at a
good hedge fund on Wall Street
are roughly the same
as hitting runner-runner flush
in a hand of Texas Hold 'Em.
You probably know what the odds
of hitting a runner-runner flush
in Texas Hold 'Em are,
don't you?
Roughly four percent.
Roughly four percent.
Well, listen,
I put a little something extra
in here for your troubles.
That will get you
through your Masters.
I think that ends
our business here.
Unless, of course, you
feel like sticking around
and taking a shot
at a real business.
Guaranteed seven figures
in the first 18 months.
Guaranteed eight figures
in the first three years.
I have met very few
people in my career
who I think can be really,
really exceptional at this.
And you are one
of those people.
The most important rule in the world
is that nobody gives you shit.
You want to do something in this
fucking life, you go out and build it.
What do you say?
Is it Newark, or you stick
around here with me?
What do you think?
I think any question
that starts with
"Either are you back
to Jersey or 'X'",
the correct answer is "X".
RICHIE: I was in.
And I took to it like a gambler's son.
He gave me
the full run of the plac.
I started right in tuning
up the affiliate business.
I learned about payment
processing, off-shore banking.
He even let me bring in
my own people.
They needed some Princeton math,
so I gave it to them.
Thirty billion
in online gambling
and I was there to make
sure we got our piece.
Three months went by
like a weekend in Vegas.
Suddenly I have
everything I want.
HERRERA: This is
a good one to bet on.
His name is Ojo Rojo.
Mister Herrera.
Paid in total.
With dollars, as you wanted
What was once paid in full
is now only half.
Next time bring 500.
Here we go.
You might find
this hard to believe
because of how welcoming
my country can be,
but some of my colleagues
in the legislature
believe your kind is ruining Costa Rica.
Me doing damage?
I'm a fountain of money
in this shithole.
I put millions
into your economy.
I give employment
to hundreds of people,
with better salaries
than you can pay.
I understand, that's
exactly what I tell them.
But they go on and on
about how the gringos and
their online gaming money
attracts undesirables, breeds
prostitution, even drugs.
How much did
I give you already?
Who knows?
If I give someone 5.7 million
dollars in three and a half years,
I notice it.
And in return, I expect more
than advice on a horse.
I want stability.
Listen to me.
You have stability and you know it.
We've been a democracy
for over 50 years
because we don't give the
people a reason to unseat us.
And the people of this country
would love nothing more
than to haul an American in
as the face of corruption.
So, that's why it's gonna
cost you more money.
Good luck with the horse.
RICHIE: All I had to do was
make sure the numbers added up
and maybe shave the player
edge here or there,
0.8 for blackjack, 0.6 for
craps and 3.4 for poker,
Hey.
There he is.
Ivan.
Thanks for having me, man.
What do you think?
Uh, crazy.
It's a little over the top,
but what are you gonna do?
I invited your buddies, too.
ANDREW: I just can't catch
a fucking break.
What are you crying about?
You dropped three grand.
You'll pick it up
later tonight.
It's like they
want me to lose.
Yeah, that's why
they build casinos.
No roll. Shooter,
you can't slide the dice.
No roll?
Fuck you, pay the bet.
Sir?
Pay the bet,
you fucking greaseball.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, hey, hey.
Take it easy, man.
The stickman is just
trying to do his job.
He fucks up again, he's gonna
have that stick up his ass.
Why don't you
let me take over?
Ladies and gentlemen,
the point is still eight.
Get your hard ways in while
the dice are in the middle.
Oh, that's great,
Zorro, work the stick.
Guess you don't have
the stones to play.
How about this?
I'll fade your action.
Just me,
or the whole table?
The whole tub.
Huh?
How about that?
If this goes bad,
I may need some credit.
Will 30K cover it?
We'll call it an advance.
Hey, shooter,
try to hit that back wall.
Believe me,
she'll appreciate it.
What shot Jesse James? A 45.
Centerfield.
Press it.
All the hard ways.
Shooter wants
to press it.
Shooter, shooter.
Six, the hard way.
If he doesn't roll
a seven and crap out,
this is gonna
cost you 100 grand.
The house can't
sweat the money.
Hey, shooter,
do me a favor.
I'm thinking of a number.
That's the number.
Let's go.
Thanks for playing.
You know what?
You forgot the eternal truth.
The house always wins.
That was pretty impressive.
That was pretty lucky.
Thanks for backing me.
It was business.
No thanks needed.
This is a single malt.
It's really good.
You should try it.
You know, I'm more of a
pizza and beer guy myself.
Baked potato with cheese
and baked beans.
And look at us now.
Look at you.
Wow.
You really do wear it.
Is this how you worked Ivan over?
I didn't work him over.
You know, part of my job
is getting close
to the people
who are close
to my employer.
So, that's it?
Just checking me
out professionally.
Pretty much.
"Pretty much."
Good luck, sir.
It's the casino toss.
You know how at the casino
when they give you chips
they say "Good luck, sir"?
They don't tell you
that "sir" means "dummy", and
"good luck" means "fuck you".
Holy shit. Those are
fucking crocodiles.
Yeah.
This guy wants me to invest in a
crocodile farm for their skin.
He sent me
these as samples.
Ivan...
Mmm?
I appreciate the invite, man.
Tonight was a blast.
Good. You had fun.
You should have fun.
I didn't have fun, I fucking hated it.
I don't know why.
It used to be fun.
Started out, it was fun.
Fuck.
Started out, it was the
greatest thing in the world.
It's like everything
you ever thought
you wanted when you
were 13 years old.
Listen, I got a guy, he's
coming in from London.
His name is Brett Sheck.
We call him "Shecky."
He's a super affiliate.
His players would represent over
Okay.
Currently, he's with these
pussies at Ultimate Bet.
I think you can sign him.
If you do,
it's gonna be on for you.
Because you're going to commission
everything you bring in.
And that's when the real
exponential money starts.
And I'm excited
to see you spend it.
You up for it?
I'm on it.
All right.
Good.
You want to throw one?
What kind of question is that?
Of course I want to throw one.
I love those
little slimy bastards.
They remind me of everybody who
wants to take a piece out of me.
Looks like somebody
made a new friend.
REBECCA: Yeah, I did.
IVAN: Well...
Good.
You want me
to stay away.
No. I want you to
do whatever you want.
God knows I do.
Hmm.
You certainly do.
Get some rest, yeah?
SHAVERS: You called him on cheating
you and got yourself a job.
I think that deserves a round of applause.
What is this?
Who the fuck are you?
If I un-cuff you, you're not gonna
do anything stupid, like run?
Because I'll shoot you.
The FBI is in the
kidnapping business now?
I do whatever I want.
Man, I'm in fucking Costa Rica.
Look, I wanted
to get you alone
and I didn't want your boss
to see us together.
You should be thanking me.
My name is Eric Shavers.
Don't call me "Eric."
Call me "Agent Shavers."
And you work for me now.
Can we just back up for
a fucking second here?
Like I said,
you caught him cheating.
But what about...
What about bribing
an official?
What about racketeering?
What about stealing the player
list from his former job
to start his new website,
Midnight Black?
Now, there's rumblings that
he wants new territories.
You are gonna be
my guy inside.
I don't know what
you think I can do, man.
I'm an independent
marketing consultant.
Look, don't play me
for stupid!
You're too smart for that.
I'm too smart for that.
You could have worked
at any respectable place.
Any legitimate casino.
Caesars Palace.
That's a nice place.
But you chose to sign up with Ivan Block.
I'm not even a principal
in the fucking company.
I can go wherever I want.
You can't go
to New Jersey.
Or any place that has
reciprocal arrangements
with New Jersey,
like New York.
What the fuck have
I done in New Jersey, huh?
Or New York,
for that matter?
You're not that bright
for a Princeton man.
It's sad.
I was talking to my
associate, Agent Mohr,
and he has a sworn statement
from a Dean Monroe
that says you were promoting
gambling at Princeton.
Now, if you were my guy,
I could make it all go away.
Wipe the slate clean.
But if the sun comes up
tomorrow and you're still here,
and you're not my guy
then I pull the trigger.
And you can forget about working on
Wall Street or any legitimate casino.
Because you need a license for that,
and felons don't get them.
See, I can stand here and say I'm
doing it because it's my job.
Or I'm upholding the law,
blah-blah-fucking-blah.
But the truth is, I'm doing
it because I enjoy it.
Hmm?
I love fucking
over Princeton guys.
Because I went to Rutgers.
Ivan!
Hey, it's important.
Oh!
Ivan! I need to talk to you.
IVAN: What's up?
Fuck, I'm so fucking
terrible at this game, man.
They only let me play
because I own the team.
I just fucking got
kidnapped by the FBI.
Good.
Oh, that's good?
Oh, I knew they'd hit
on you sometime,
I just didn't know
what you'd do.
Now I do.
Is it that guy Shavers?
Did he give you the line
about how I'm a bad guy,
you gotta leave town,
all that shit?
Yeah, he's threatened
me with jail.
He said I'd be barred from
re-entering the country.
Listen, you're not
gonna go to jail, okay?
You got grabbed up
by the FBI.
I get it.
That's really fucking scary.
I was terrified the first
time it happened to me.
if you want to get on a plane and
just get the fuck out of here.
Just ask yourself
one thing.
Are you doing
something wrong?
Are we?
I make it possible
for a fat guy in Cleveland
to play Omaha Hi-Lo in his
underwear in his living room.
Shoot me.
I mean, these fucking
shoe companies,
they pay a Chinese
eight-year-old two nickels
to hand-stitch these fucking
things till their fingers bleed,
then they sell them in the ghetto
in the United States for $250.
And I'm the fucking criminal?
Then why is this guy all over me, huh?
Why is he fucking with me?
Because he's jealous.
He's ,hating on you, that's why.
He sees what you have,
he sees what you're gonna have,
and he's plugging away
in a bad suit
and heavy shoes
for chump change.
Look, man, even if it was a crime,
there's nothing
they could do about it
because they don't
have enough jurisdiction
to write us a fucking
parking ticket down here.
Richie, I look at you,
and I see myself.
You got that same "fuck you"
look in your eye.
You've been beat up,
you've been knocked down,
you've been kicked around, you've
been told you weren't good enough,
and you have
something to prove.
Now is the time to do it.
But let me know.
Either way, someone's got
to deal with Shecky.
RICHIE: Block is
a one man industry, Shecky.
He figured out how
to take online gambling
and make it sexy, with
the money and the women.
Because that's the true
crave-able experience.
Know what I crave?
Name it.
Thirty-three percent
rake-back on my poker players
and cost per acquisition
on my casino gamers.
We're at 30 percent
and rev-share.
Well, I'm getting my terms at UB
and they're happy to have me, so,
I think I'm gonna
stay where I am.
Tell you what,
give me a day.
I'll talk to him about matching,
we'll lock this thing up.
All right,
I'll give you a day.
But then
I got to get home,
my wife and I are about
to have our first kid.
Cheers.
Ivan.
I spoke with Sheck.
Yeah?
A few little things
and we're pagando blackjack.
What few little things?
He wants an extra
three points rake-back
and to stay at
cost per acquisition.
I know it's not
the original deal,
but, uh, we still
make a huge profit.
No. Fuck him.
If we give him that, every piker
who thinks he's an affiliate
is gonna want
the same thing. No.
Then I don't think
we get him.
Well, then I guess that's it,
you don't want the bonus.
You know what I mean?
Pack your shit.
No, no, no.
Ivan, wait.
I've got this.
Tell me how much room
I have to negotiate.
You have no room
to negotiate.
You already
tried negotiating.
Now, you try leverage.
Everybody has something they
care about more than money.
Find out what that is.
Then you gotta do
the hard thing.
That little voice in the
back of your head right now?
It's not your conscience.
It's fear.
Hey, man.
How you doing?
Thanks for hanging in there,
giving me the day.
How could I pass up
the chance for marlin?
Are we good to go?
Just got to wait
for the crew to board.
Who's this guy?
Oh, he drives the boat.
Here comes your crew.
Permission to come aboard?
God, I love that accent.
Permission granted.
Come on, girls.
Look, man.
Eat, drink, fish.
Compliments of Ivan Block.
He's not gonna match
the UB terms,
but we do want you
to think of us as friends
so, if you ever decide to switch,
we'll be your first call.
Have fun.
I'll try.
Hi.
SHECKY: Well, hi.
SHECKY:
I'm a fucking idiot.
They are very good-looking.
It's my own fault.
I can't blame you,
you're nothing.
I've got everything.
I've got a great wife, a
baby on the way, a business.
And I've got to come to Costa
Rica and act like an asshole.
I'm sure Block's gonna
press the terms now.
No, actually,
the terms are the same
ones we offered you.
Block wants you to feel great
about working with us.
Question is, where am
I gonna be working?
You can still work in London.
Yeah, but will my checks be
coming from a Costa Rican bank,
or Caymans, or Malta,
or somewhere else?
I've heard the whispers.
Block's not too popular
around these parts anymore.
One of the reasons
I was gonna stay away.
Player list.
My man. You got it?
Got it.
You're a fucking genius.
Come here, watch this.
Wilson,
can you get 30 racks?
Right?
Emails,
betting history.
By Sunday, 200,000
of these penguins
will be betting
football on our site.
By the weekend, we'll
be doing nine million.
We'll lose some of them,
but luckily, we got Shecky out
there bringing them back for us,
so, we're gonna
be all right.
And this is
my thanks to you.
It's a little bonus to show
how much we appreciate you.
You're a fucking man and you
did what you had to do.
Spend it all in one place.
Knock yourself out.
Do some degenerate shit.
Do it in my car.
Which one?
Whichever one you want.
Thanks, Richie.
You're a good man.
Richie. Honestly, this is the
greatest night of my life, man.
I can't thank you enough.
RICHIE: You don't look like
you're having any fun.
You know, we, uh,
can't do this.
If you like me,
what's the problem?
You know what
the problem is.
You're right, I should
probably call you a car.
Mmm.
Immediately.
Get you out of here.
Mmm-hmm.
I think
that's the best idea.
My father described this place
as a gambler's paradise.
But to be honest, I never
really put too much stock
into what my father
had to say, ever.
Especially about gambling.
Well,
as a gaming professional,
that's exactly the type of
customer I want in the world.
You would love him then.
But as your friend,
I'm sorry.
As my friend?
Let's just...
No. No, you're right.
Let's not get
too excited, okay?
No, no, no.
Too strong.
Um, wrong word.
"Colleague."
Much better.
I can work with that.
How do you get
used to all this?
Well...
There was no "all this"
when we came here.
We built it all,
Ivan and I.
So, you two were together?
It was a moment. Um...
But it wasn't like this.
Put your bags down.
No fucking way, man.
I'm getting out of here and
you should do the same thing.
Come on, man. The three amigos.
You gotta stay.
What's up, boys?
Hey, Richie.
What a night, huh?
Crazy.
Yeah, fun ride, Richie.
I'm out.
Out to where?
Out to home.
I'm all the way out.
What are you
talking about?
Tell him, Pet.
Just tell him.
Tell me.
I'm leaving
my girl's hotel room
this morning when
this real hard-ass,
Agent Whatever-the-fuck-his-name-is,
from the FBI,
rolls up on me, tells me
I'm breaking U.S. fiduciary...
I got braced, too.
Same guy, same speech.
You could tell him
to kiss your ass.
He can't touch us down here.
He said some scary
shit about Block.
He's a government
functionary, Pet.
That's what they do.
Block is the biggest trophy that
Shavers could ever take down.
Who gives a shit
what he says?
He told me I could be barred
from re-entering the country
if I didn't leave now.
So, what are you gonna do,
try and re-open your skin?
My brother owns a broker-dealer,
he offered me a job.
Wall Street?
PET: I'll be rich, not super-rich.
I can deal.
What the fuck?
What?
Oh.
I hide it in there from the maids.
They hate bran.
They eat everything else in the
kitchen, but they don't eat the bran.
Do me a favor.
Invest it for me.
I just don't have time to
spend it while I'm here.
I'm in a basement all day.
You should come with.
No. I'm finally in the real
shit, optimizing the platform.
That's where
the real money's at.
To be honest,
super-rich works for me.
Richie, I understand
the path you're on.
But you should
pack it in, pal.
I can't do it, hoss.
My future is here.
All right, hoss.
See you.
Hello.
IVAN: Young Richie!
I got something
I need you to do.
It's gonna be a crash course
in client relations.
Ivan.
Excuse me, Richie.
I'm sorry,
what's the problem?
Send someone else.
Why would I do that?
You don't have any
personal feelings in this.
Please.
Okay, look, here's
what I need you to do.
Meet Wilson at the casino.
You are gonna use that key to go
to the cage and open box 765.
You are gonna remove
the contents of that box.
I want you to give what's inside
that briefcae to Mr. Herrera.
He's the gaming commissioner, which
makes him Caesar in this country.
Without him,
we can't operate.
My friend.
How are you doing?
Good, how are you?
I'm really great.
Let's make a hug.
I want you to meet
a magical unicorn.
Very rare.
Would you like to partake?
I'm fine, thank you.
Okay. Come have a seat.
Sit. Sit.
Let me show you something.
Let's talk about the...
Right?
It's something else.
First class.
Not coach. First class.
It's a very nice gesture.
I'm good to go.
Right here!
Mmm?
Is there somebody else
coming with the rest of it?
The rest?
The rest.
No, that is
the entire selection.
Well, maybe we have had
a misunderstanding.
Or perhaps your boss is
trying to send me a message.
Um...
I'd be happy to let him know
that you're unhappy.
Why don't I take care of your
tab for the evening, huh?
It'd be my pleasure.
Here. You know what?
Thank you.
It's very generous.
I will let Ivan know
about this misunderstanding.
Okay.
You think you can buy me
with some cheap whores like
some fucking congressman?
Tell your puto gringo boss
I'm sending a message.
Ivan!
Block!
Did you get in a fight
with your kid sister?
Funny guy.
Where is he?
Richie, you were just a little too
good-looking for this racket.
Why did you short him?
IVAN: I didn't short him.
It's an ongoing negotiation.
Then you got more than
an ongoing negotiation.
You have
a fucking problem.
Did he take the money?
Yeah, he took it.
Then what's the fucking
problem, Richie?
I mean, it's the gambling
business in Costa Rica.
Occasionally, you get
punched in the face.
You let me walk
right into it, Ivan.
This is your job.
You understand?
If you want a safer job,
go work for the post office.
You want a clear conscience?
Go start a charity.
But if you want
your own fucking island
and your boss says you gotta go
out there and take a beating,
go out there, take it,
come back to work and say,
"Do you need me
to do it again?"
Because right now, I am giving
you the keys to the kingdom.
How did you know I'd even
make it out of there alive?
How did you know?
Because you're a winner.
Because I believe in you.
And you got hurt.
I'm sorry.
But if I'm telling the truth,
I'd do it again.
What the fuck
you looking at?
Did you see this coming?
Six months ago, Herrera wouldn't
have touched anyone I know.
And six weeks from now,
that could be me.
Or it could be you.
We're moving up the timetable.
Okay?
RICHIE: When the wrong card hits the
board, you can go from a great had
Hey, what's going on?
What is the...
What the fuck?
Hello.
You have been selected because
of suspicion of drugs.
I don't have any drugs.
We'll see.
"We'll see"?
I don't have any fucking drugs!
I think the lab is going to test
positive for Mexican Brown.
That's not fucking mine.
Tar heroin.
Come on, man.
You planted that!
Pasaporte,
United States, huh?
You're not going
to need this anymore.
Oh, Richie, Richie, Richie.
You're making me look bad.
Shavers, look,
I believe you.
Everything you said about
Block is true, okay?
I'm trying to go home.
You can't go home now.
Now that the fun's starting.
Especially not without
your passport.
And I know you
can't go home now
that the sergeant
has his hands on you.
He's been a bad boy.
Now, Richie, this is what I'm
willing to do for you, man.
So I'll talk to the sergeant and
have him wipe the slate clean.
You'll never know this happened.
How about that?
You want me to
do that for you, huh?
Sergeant, can you do that?
See that? Look at
that smile on his face.
See, that's
the problem, Richie.
I keep fucking doing for you,
so when are you gonna do for me?
When's it gonna be my turn?
BARRANCAS: When's it going
to be our turn?
What are you, the only guy
here not on Block's payroll?
All right!
RICHIE: Fuck, man!
Why don't you just
fucking arrest him?
You guys don't have jurisdictional
issues like the FBI!
But if I walk him into a
station house or a courtroom,
what do you think
he's going to do, huh?
He's going to buy the judge a steak
dinner and I don't have a job!
All you got to do is help us
and all this goes away.
Otherwise, you better brush
up on your prison Spanish
because they don't
take too kind
to gringo drug
dealers down here.
ANDREW: Richie. Jesus,
where the hell you been, man?
What the fuck happened
to your face?
Nothing.
What did you want to show me?
All right.
So they got me running these
credit card security protocols.
And I get in there,
into the code,
and I decide to freelance
around a little bit, right?
So, I find there's nothing in the
individual players' accounts.
What do you mean,
"nothing"?
Nothing.
Practically drained, dude.
They keep enough in there
to cover the floats.
So if any given player
wanted to cash out,
the software would find the
money and then pay him off.
In the meantime,
Block's just using
everybody else's
funds as his own.
Wait. So,
what are you saying?
This whole fucking thing
is a Ponzi scheme.
ARCHIE: Hey, Richie!
Block's upstairs.
He wants to see you.
All right.
IVAN: Hey.
Come on in, Richie.
Have a seat.
So, Richie,
here's the thing.
People often make poor decisions
when they're desperate.
You know what I mean?
No.
What do you mean?
Let's say you're being
charged by a bear.
You're supposed
to stand still.
Most people run and they
end up getting killed.
It's understandable, right?
Let me show you something.
I really have Wilson
to thank for this.
He don't look like much,
but he's a dog
with a bone when
he gets an assignment.
This is some surveillance
footage he dug up.
Would you look at that?
Take a few years off him and the old guy
really does look like you, doesn't he?
This is the Trop in AC.
If I wasn't your friend, I'd
say your dad was a deadbeat.
There isn't a casino,
a bookmaker, or shylock
from Vegas to New York
that the old man isn't into
for some serious wood.
You owe money like that,
you get a reputation.
That's how I knew
how to find him.
And now hopefully
we can get him some help.
And get you
some help, too.
This is my favorite part,
right here.
Look at this.
That isn't just card counting,
that's passing a bobo.
Turns out, the old man's been
kiting counterfeit bills
from Tunica to Nevada.
They were about
to arrest him
before I grabbed him up.
In fact, I have him over at
the Intercontinental Hotel,
just down the street.
Here's the thing, Richie.
Your dad owes $187,000 to some
guys that don't fuck around.
But you're my man, and you
took some hits for me.
And I don't forget that.
So this is what I did.
I bought the debt.
I own the paper
on your father.
The only person who can
do anything to him now
is me.
Which is good news, because I would
never do anything like that.
I hold the debt,
your dad stays healthy,
and we can all go back
to exactly how it was.
Okay?
Yeah, thank you.
I appreciate it.
Richie?
Uh, come in.
Sit.
See this?
What do you think?
This is where they put me.
It's a real soft spot, huh?
It's real nice, Dad.
Yeah, it reminds me of that suite we
were comped in Atlantic City once
when you were a kid.
Are you talking about the time you
left me all alone in the hotel room
while you were
at the casino?
Look, Rich, you know,
I wish I had a time machine, I'd
go back and I'd fix everything,
but I don't.
We're here now.
And where do you think
"here" is? Huh?
Paradise?
Well, you know, it kind
of looks that way to me.
Let's go out on the balcony.
Check out the view.
Look, I know where I am,
all right?
And I knew exactly what was happening
the minute my debt got bought
and they offer me this trip.
Come on.
Been around gambling all my life,
and that would be a miracle.
And miracles don't happen.
So you know
Block owns the debt.
Yeah.
And I know that's worse than any
wise guys walking the boardwalk
because it isn't just me that
he's got under his hammer.
Yeah, I know.
Apparently this shit
runs in the family.
It doesn't have to.
I just don't want to see you
making the same mistakes I made.
Going after this bullshit.
Chasing the action.
Come on, don't let them
use me to keep you here.
Go. Run.
Run, for Christ's sake.
Just run.
Go back.
Go back to school.
I mean...
I've been a dead man walking
for the last 15 years.
Dad, try and sit tight.
I'll figure a way to get
us both out of this.
No, no, no. Come on.
After all these years,
you're still worrying about me?
You're my dad.
That's your mother talking.
She raised you right,
I guess.
RICHIE: Payoffs are how the casino
business in Costa Rica works.
It's why this government
doesn't shut Block down.
But now it's time for me to
buy some goodwill of my own.
Yeah?
Agent Shavers was right about everything.
We should have left.
Shavers?
You said he didn't even approach you.
Listen, after the players'
accounts, I found something else.
It's a way bigger scam than I thought.
We're screwed, man.
Cronin, slow the fuck down.
What are you trying to tell me?
Just come see me.
I gotta show you
in person.
Hey, Richie.
Where you going, babe?
Going home.
Yeah?
Why don't you
do that later?
Come take
a ride with me.
Wilson.
Where are we going?
Don't worry about it.
Enjoy the ride, man.
So neither of you guys are gonna
tell me what the fuck we're doing?
Get off the boat.
Come on.
IVAN: Richie!
How you doing, bud?
Fellas.
Hey. Richie, remember, um,
that whole thing
I was telling you
about the Indians?
Not the casino thing, but the
respecting what you kill.
Or whatever that
hokum shit was.
All right,
here's the deal with this.
The over-under
is 90 seconds.
Bet is $10,000.
Do I pay you guys enough
to jump in on 10 grand?
Yeah, I take the over.
How's that?
What the fuck
you talking about?
It's so fucking dark,
it's gonna be two minutes
before they even
get the fucking scent.
I brought two idiots
to Latin America, Richie.
It's like sand to the beach,
but what are you gonna do?
What the fuck is this?
This is where
the Rio Tarcoles lets out.
HERRERA: Ivan...
Your problem is with me,
let him go.
Hey, Herrera, if you hadn't
acted like an asshole,
you wouldn't be on
your knees right now.
So don't try
to be noble.
Basically, this place is
to crocodiles
what Goldman Sachs is to
pricks with skinny ties.
There's just
a fucking ton of them.
Cruise ships come down here,
they dump off their edible waste,
the crocs have learned
to swim downriver
and they know to bite
whatever jumps in the water.
This shit
is chicken fat.
I don't know why,
but for some reason
these fuckers
really like poultry.
All right, go ahead.
All right, ready?
Ready to fire it up?
Wilson, keep the clock.
Here we go.
One, two...
Fucking Christ, Ivan!
Swim!
What do you want?!
You scared the shit
out of them.
Can we fucking
pull them back in?
Hold on. Shh, shh.
Do you hear them?
I'm fucking talking
to you, motherfucker!
Ivan!
We got fucking money
on this, dude. Chill.
You've scared
the shit out of them.
Why don't you just
pull them back in?
What the fuck
is wrong with you?
Dude...
I'm doing this
for you, man.
RICHIE: Would you
just pull them in?
HERRERA: What do you need?
RICHIE: Jesus Christ!
Fucking bullshit
local legend, I guess.
Give me the fucking thing.
All right, calm down.
Fuck me.
It's just a little fun,
that's all.
Come here. Hey, come here!
Oh, shit!
Now they fucking come!
Do something!
I got it.
Are you all right?
I'm not getting them out.
You get them out.
Pull them in.
WILSON: Holy fuck, man.
Come on.
Let's go.
What are the odds?
I was kidding around.
I didn't really think
crocodiles would come.
We just
got lucky, I guess.
Are you all right, Richie?
You seem a little worked up,
a little sweaty.
Is it the hot night or...
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm good.
Okay, good.
Terrific.
All right, clean them up.
Let's get them out of here.
Good luck. Hey,
how did that horse do?
I'm fucking with you.
I know
this isn't a good time.
All right, let's go.
Let's go.
See you soon, Richie.
Cronin?
Andrew?
Cronin.
Fuck, man.
What's happened?
Did Block send you?
No, he didn't send me.
Something's happened
to Cronin.
He was cooperating
with the Feds.
But you knew that already,
didn't you?
I didn't.
Bullshit.
Let me ask you a question.
When I talk to you,
am I talking to Block?
Not anymore.
I wish I could believe that.
You can.
You can trust...
No, I can't trust you.
I did trust you!
I didn't know that he
was going to use you.
Stop fucking lying to me!
Ivan is set to pull out
of this place in a week.
We're moving to Antigua.
And?
And he's looking to
hang things on someone.
A mark.
Me.
And when he's gone, all of those
people that we've crossed,
they're gonna come
looking for you.
How long have
you known this?
I started wondering
after two years.
By the third year,
when we left the Caymans,
I knew for sure
that he was stealing.
But by that point
I was too far in.
I'd signed a contract,
there was a paper trail.
That's what Ivan
does to you.
He figures out
exactly what you want
and he gives it to you.
I'm sorry.
I hope so.
Because what I have to do
to get out of this,
I can't do it alone.
RICHIE: The payoff merry-go-round
has to keep spinning.
And I need operating cash
to buy my way out.
So it's less for them
and more for me.
I'm just hoping I'll be gone
before the hammer comes down.
RICHIE: Boys.
Gotta love this country.
Yesterday you wanted to kill me
and today we're like brothers.
We are not
fucking brothers.
I need to talk to Herrera.
He's gone, he left the country
early this morning.
Then we need to talk.
WOMAN: Esteban?
Esteban!
Where is he?
RICHIE: I put together a savings
account for this guEl Capitan.
Yeah, that's his real name.
Is this gonna work?
I guess we'll see.
Where the fuck is Cronin?
You tell me. I thought he
was working for you guys.
You don't understand
cooperation, do you?
You're supposed to keep
me posted on Block.
Circumstances have changed.
What's changed?
Block has my father.
Well, if you had told us,
we could have kept him safe.
But you didn't.
So where the hell is Cronin?
I'm on the phone with him
and the next thing I know
he fucking disappears!
Shit.
You know what?
You guys are so full of shit.
You blackmail me!
You beat the shit out of me!
You say you can protect me,
protect my father.
You can't even protect
the only source you had!
Fuck both of you. I'm done.
You're going to fucking help us!
You understand me?
I'm not doing shit!
You want to arrest me?
Fucking arrest me!
I'll fucking kill you!
I don't give a shit!
All right, let him up!
SHAVERS: We went about this all wrong.
I'm sorry, are you okay?
I'm sorry.
But I don't have time to
fucking play with you.
Take a picture with me.
Here we go.
Good.
Now you have forty-eight hours
to get me what I need on Block.
A piece of evidence that
will hold up in court.
If you don't, he gets that picture
and your life goes to shit.
Let's go.
Come on, Cronin, what the
fuck did you do with it?
RICHIE: Cronin really got
his nose in it.
Layers and layers
of financial crimes.
Block using player accounts
as his own piggy bank.
Laundering money and, of course,
Block's contingency plan.
Oh, my God.
There's enough evidence on
here to put Block or me
Have you been
booking travel?
I have.
I put everything
I have into it.
Planes aren't cheap.
Thank you.
Block has been siphoning
the player account money
and directly routing it to bank
accounts with my name on them.
But when this goes public it's
going to look like I own them.
All the bank account info, the
missing money, everything.
Ivan's told me to pack.
We leave in 48 hours.
Everything's ready
in Antigua.
You know
I'm with you.
New love.
What are you doing?
Uh, you know,
I was just leaving.
I was gonna go
make the rounds.
RICHIE: One last
payoff toEl Capitan.
This isn't poker, this is my life.
And I have one play left.
Push all my chips in
and hope to get lucky.
Did you bring
something for me?
I am a man of my word.
Very good.
I'm also a man of my word.
WILSON: Hey,
where you going?
You know, for being
such a smart kid,
you make some dumb fucking
moves, you know that?
You don't think
I know who that guy is?
Where he works,
what he does? Hmm?
You don't think I know
what you're trying to do?
You're done, Richie.
I think you should just walk
outside and get in my car.
There's gotta be some kind
of deal you and I can make.
Thank you, Richie,
but I'm well taken care of.
I think you should
stop embarrassing yourself,
walk outside, and get in
the motherfucking car, man.
You don't think
I'm taken care of, too?
Shavers.
We found Cronin beat half
to death, but he's alive.
Thank God.
Where are you?
Are you bringing me evidence?
No. I'm bringing
you something better.
RICHIE: Block
timed it perfectly.
He's out the door by the
time the bribes stopped
and the police
took everything down.
Yeah?
Hey, Richie.
Where are you?
At the office.
Ivan, what the hell is going on?
The site's been frozen.
IVAN: Listen, Richie, you're
about to get arrested, okay?
I'd love to tell you that I was gonna
come down to the police station
and bail you out but we
both know that's not true.
Sorry it worked out
this way.
I like you,
you're a good kid.
But it is what it is.
You all right?
Yeah, set.
You'll find another boyfriend
when we land at the next stop.
Younger and
dumber next time.
Dumber won't be easy.
Where the fuck is Wilson?
I haven't seen him.
Let's go. He'll have
to fend for himself.
Do you mind? Sun.
I love new beginnings.
Any new industry,
the first 10 years,
it's like Russia
after Communism.
It's all strength
and will.
And now, it's time for a
little nuance and finesse.
RICHIE: Every player has
a leak in his game.
Even Block.
All you have to do
is find it.
RICHIE: You really saw
me coming, didn't you?
The cars, the boats,
the money, everything.
You handpicked me, and you
slow-played it perfectly.
What did you expect
me to do, Richie?
Walk into my party,
accuse me of cheating
in front of all my friends.
I can't let that go by.
That's the problem
with your generation.
You guys sat around
with your vintage T-shirts
and your participation medals
and you never did anything.
And you got too big
and too greedy.
Okay. What are you
gonna do about it?
You don't think
I own this place, too?
And where exactly
do you think this is?
Bienvenidos
a Puerto RicoIvan!
Territory of the United
States of America.
RICHIE: The Captain,
a man of his word.
I knew deep down
you were just homesick.
You know what your biggest
problem is, Ivan?
You talk and you talk, but you
don't actually hear yourself.
Well, I did.
And you're just like every other
gambler who comes onto your site.
You press it, when you should
have folded and moved on.
Later on,
when you're in prison,
that voice you'll be
hearing in your head
isn't your conscience,
it's fear.
SHAVERS: Ivan Block, you're
under arrest, my friend.
How's it going, fellas?
Better than you.
Money laundering, racketeering,
wire fraud.
Look under your feet.
That's American concrete.
Kiss it, because you'll be
sleeping on it for a long time.
We'll see.
That's the great thing about America,
we go soft on financial crime.
Maybe eight months on a
farm, something like that.
Maybe I'll see
you around, Richie.
Good luck, sir.
Get this piece
of shit in the car.
What about him?
Him? He's a cooperator.
Yeah, don't worry
about him.
Think about him banging your
girl while you're in jail.
Now, here's the good part.
You have the right
to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.
You have the right
to an attorney.
If you cannot
afford an attorney,
a really fucked-up one
will be provided for you.
Listen, I want you
to get Richie Furst.
I want to start
this debriefing ASAP.
You don't think
he's on that plane?
You got to be kidding me.
Go with the ground crew!
Hey! Somebody stop
that plane!
We had a deal!
Shit!
Agent Shavers?
Yeah?
I have something for you.
Thank you.
He's a free man.
Let's go!
I've never even been on a
private plane before today.
You get used to
it pretty quickly.
