Stay on the beacon!
Manolo, we lost the beacon.
My God! My God!
What's our heading?
I don't know.
We lost all navigation.
Pull the nose up!
I can't!
Come on, pool is closed, everyone.
Out of the water.
Stow that gear and get out of here.
Get these divers out of the water.
Let's go, let's go. Come on, back here.
Taking too long.
Watch your step. Here you go.
Assholes and elbows, that's all.
You all right?
Where's that fat guy's weight belt?
That's coming out of your pay, Jared.
Would you shut up for two seconds?
If I wanted that kind of lip,
I'd drop my fly. Let's go.
What about my weight belt?
Those are 60 bucks a pop.
You want me to take that out
of your paycheck?
I'll tell you what, Bob.
I got him in, you get him out.
Here at the Atlantis, we have the
largest marine habitat in the world.
The nurse sharks in this habitat
grow up to 14 feet...
...and feed differently
than most other sharks.
They suck in their prey
with one powerful inhalation...
...and they swallow it
pretty much whole.
Do you guys hear that?
Yeah.
Did you ever get bit?
Yeah, Gina here got a little too frisky
with me one day last year.
But for the most part, shark attacks are
just a simple case of mistaken identity.
Hey, Boone.
What's your daddy up to?
Hey.
Hey.
Smells good over there.
What?
Smells good in there.
Yeah, that's my famous chili
and corn bread.
What?
Last time you made your chili
and corn bread...
...your ex-girlfriend was here.
Then, the time before that,
you brought home a pregnant...
...flea-infested, three-legged dog.
Last time a storm came through here,
like that last one...
Kam Jackson...
You remember Kam Jackson?
Found that golden cross, remember,
on the north side of the island?
That hurricane that came through
moved so much sand...
...who knows how many
shipwrecks it uncovered?
So this is where
your chili comes in?
I'm saying I should be
out prospecting.
Quit your job?
No, I was fired,
but it's all part of the plan.
I'm just gonna get this thing going,
get the boat shaped up...
...make a big find, and we'll live
the rest of our lives on our own clock.
I thought we already were.
Yeah, but we'll be rich.
You okay?
Here, let me see.
I'm all right.
Honey...
Stinking boat.
You know I'd live on this
broken boat with you, right?
I love it when you say stuff like that.
Hey. Hey.
You guys okay?
Yeah.
Yeah, we're good, man.
Just plugging a few holes, you know?
Sea Robin looks great.
Yeah, we just finished it.
We got her out to sea
before the storm hit.
We've been working every day since.
What are you looking for?
They found the Titanic.
You didn't hear?
Oh, you mean the one
with the dishes?
No, I only hunt for stuff that comes
in gold and silver. You know that.
Hey, Sam.
Here.
Found it this morning
where we were blowing a site.
Maybe this guy can find a stone
to put in that thing.
Hey, I'm sorry about your boat.
You want my guy to take a look at it?
I think it's looking good.
Got it under control.
All right.
Well, the least I can do is offer.
Word on the water
is you're out of work.
You can always come back
and work for me.
No. I got my own thing going now.
But if you wanna subcontract me,
that's cool.
We can work something out.
Like a fifty-fifty thing, you know?
You don't just take a rowboat out and
find a treasure chest filled with gold.
It took me almost 10 years of scraping
till I found my first haul.
Hey, I mean what I say.
You need help getting back
in the water, let me know.
Move it out.
Hey, Quinn.
You wanna come work for a real
captain, you let me know, all right?
Are you a captain now? You know,
the water goes outside of the boat.
We'll see you, Sam.
You know I can't slave
for Bates again.
I know that.
There's no way I'm gonna
bust my ass while he gets rich.
Meanwhile, he's blasting holes
in the reef.
I just don't operate that way.
I know, honey.
I just want you to be happy, okay?
You know that.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Welcome to the Bahamas.
It's a pleasure having you here.
Thank you.
Welcome to paradise.
It's a pleasure having you here, sir.
It's a pleasure having me here too.
Thank you.
Business or pleasure?
Come on, bro, what do you think?
Enjoy your stay.
No way.
It's Mr. OG Wannabe.
What's up, you scruffy
little beach rat?
Okay.
I'm gonna throw your ass
right now. Watch.
Go to sleep, go to sleep.
Okay, okay.
All right.
You've been spending
too much time in court.
Wait, hold on, hold on.
Don't move for a second.
Oh, that feels really good.
You sick-ass.
What's up?
Good to see you.
Good to see you too, bro.
How's New York treating you?
It's paying me. A lot of bad guys
need defending, I defend them.
That's what I do.
That's still a scary thought.
Oh, my God. Can I get a what-what
and a side of french fries?
Look at that body.
It's ridiculous. Holy shit.
How much have you missed me?
Oh, every minute.
Oh, my God, it's so tight too.
It's like that everywhere, even.
It's good to see you, Sam.
If we had met first, you and l...
...things would be a lot different,
you know.
Easy, cheesy.
Anyway. Okay, so you must be Lisa?
Who's Lisa?
Yeah, who the hell is Lisa?
Amanda. Amanda.
Amanda.
Hi, Amanda. I'm Sam.
Welcome to the Bahamas.
Hi. Nice to meet you, Sam.
I'm Jared.
Amanda.
Sorry about that.
Let's go. These guys are ridiculous.
You're such an idiot.
Decent save. You did good.
No, that was horrible.
I love the Caribbean.
Too hot to wear shirts,
too hot to wear pants...
...and we're two hot young ladies.
You dive?
Yeah, I can keep up.
So how long you known
this one for?
I don't know, about 14 hours now.
Picked her up last night
at The Mercer...
I picked you up last night.
Don't start lying already.
So you and Bryce.
I think I'm in love. Serious.
I'm not serious.
The guy who owned this place got hit
with 44 counts of racketeering...
...and money laundering.
Our firm represented him.
This is how he floated the bill.
You gotta be kidding me.
Boat problem? No problem.
Boat and skis come with the crib.
We get the boat?
You know how Daddy does it.
We get the boat?
We get the boat.
We get the boat! We get the boat!
Let's see it, bro, come on.
Oh, my gosh.
There he goes.
How you like me now?
That was so hot.
How sick was that?
That was amazing.
Where are we?
It's our secret spot.
Amazing, isn't it?
Shark, dude. Get out of the water.
There's a shark.
Come on.
Jared, get out. It's a shark.
Come on, swim. Swim to me,
swim to me, Jared, swim to me.
Get out, get out.
Come on, come on, get out.
What are you laughing at? Get out.
There are sharks everywhere, look.
Give me my mask
and my fins real quick.
You... No, you don't need a mask.
There's a shark. He looks like Jaws.
Get out.
Yeah, but I lost my watch.
You lost...?
You need an arm to wear a watch.
Would you get out
of the water, stupid?
Sam gave me it for my birthday.
I don't care. Sam, get...
What are you doing?
They're just curious.
Curious as to what? As to what?
What his ass tastes like?
Dude, get out. Seri...
Oh, my God, look at that. That shark.
Hold on. Hold.
Sam, what is he doing?
Right there, right there.
You cool?
Don't do that.
Come on, don't do that.
It's not funny?
No.
Look. Look what I found.
No way. That's a rock, honey.
Three-minute breath-hold
and the guy comes up with a rock.
I mean, what are the odds of that?
Wait till I tell the boys at the office.
No, that's a ballast stone, man.
Ships used to carry them
in their hull.
Wow, right.
Well, I got a box of Cohibas...
...and some rum from back in the day
over on the land part of Earth. Let's...
Let's handle it over there,
you know?
He always finds these things.
It's the ship that's always missing.
Help me out. Let's get back in
the water before the sun goes down.
Really? You think there's
something down there?
I don't know. Grab your stuff.
Hold on. Are you insane?
You think I'm going back in there
with those things? I'm mad at you.
They're not aggressive.
It's tiger sharks you should avoid.
Yeah, she's right.
Those tiger sharks are bad news.
Those are the ones that are furry
and have the stripes on them.
That was a joke.
He's funny now, this guy. Okay.
Yeah, no,
I'm not getting in the water.
It's gold, right?
You find something?
Yeah.
What?
A plane.
Like an airplane?
Yeah, like an airplane.
Well, that's odd.
How many of these
do you think are down there?
I don't know, enough bricks
to build a house.
A multimillion-dollar
cocaine palace.
With a pool and a waterfall and
a giraffe nibbling on the front yard.
How about a prison cell
with no sunlight for 10 years?
Yeah, we're out of here.
Jared, what about this?
What-y-what-what?
Come on, Amanda, don't be stupid.
Oh, we're not gonna get caught.
You're right, we're not.
Come on. It's for us.
Come on, relax.
I am.
We'll save it for a rainy day.
Or a rainy month.
Come on, seriously.
Maybe a sunny day?
Let me see it real quick.
Hey, Sam. Come here.
Hey. Wait, wait.
Come here, come here.
Sam, Sam, stop.
Let's just let the defense present
its case for a second.
All right.
I don't do drugs.
I hate drugs.
Sure.
But throwing this away, I don't know.
Maybe I object. Silly, right?
Throwing it away,
doesn't it seem silly?
Throwing it in the...
ln the ocean?
Trash?
Wait, let me see this.
I think, you know, it would be...
What are you doing?
It's going away.
Really?
Yeah.
Wow, that's intense.
That's a new boat, Jared.
That's a new b...
Threw away a new boat. Okay.
We're out of here.
Threw a new boat into the ocean.
You guys are a lot of fun.
You're gonna keep this,
though, right?
Yep. Jackass.
Okay, good.
What do you think, Jared? You think
there's more treasure down there?
Big storms bring big treasure.
Oh, good. What does that mean?
What she's saying is that hurricanes
like the one that came through here...
...sometimes what they do is they sift
stuff out that's been buried.
Good, so we go back tomorrow
and we dig.
Not if we report that plane crash.
The place will turn
into a crime scene.
Coast Guard, DEA. They'll be all over
it and we'll never get near it again.
What happened to
"finders keepers, losers weepers"?
The law down here
doesn't play by those rules.
See, the thing of it is,
you have to file a claim.
In order to file a claim,
you have to identify the wreck.
We have to be able to name
what it was and where it came from.
So like I keep saying, we go down
tomorrow and we dig and we find out.
What about the plane?
What about the plane?
We found bodies. Don't you think
we should tell someone?
They're drug dealers, Sam.
They're not missionaries...
...flying care packages
to starving kids in Africa. Okay?
Don't worry. Their girlfriends
will have new pimps...
...before the milk in the refrigerator
goes bad. It's fine.
Don't you think somebody
wants their lost luggage?
I'm sure that they do,
I'm sure that they do.
All the more reason we need to
keep our mouths closed.
Yeah, because, you know,
loose lips, they sink ships.
That's right, baby.
Loose lips do sink ships.
Now, look, what we do is we go down,
we identify the wreck...
...and then we call in the plane.
Right? Unless... Unless you don't have
a problem with somebody else...
...laying claim on your treasure.
These aren't like those shipwrecks
you have at the bottom of a fish tank.
I mean, it could be spread
all over the ocean floor.
She's right.
But, Sam, I really think
we can do this.
And the equipment we need
and don't have?
That's where Mr. Deep Pockets
comes in.
Right?
That's right.
The Kid.
The bottom line is we could
spend the rest of our lives...
...waiting for another
opportunity like this.
All right.
What?
All right.
Come on, excitement, a little bit.
Can we have some fun...?
Under one condition.
Fine.
We report that plane...
...as soon as we can
make a claim...
...and we stay the hell away
from it until then.
Don't look at me.
Come on, guys. I'll just stay here
and suck on my thumb...
...while you play
Pirates of the Caribbean.
All right, one more thing, though.
Not a word to anyone.
Okay?
Got it, got it, got it. We're good.
Can we drink to this, please?
We're gonna be rich, people.
Cheers, big ears.
Cheers.
Cheers to being loaded.
Check it out, though,
I need a... I need a compressor...
...air lifts, four sets of AGA gear,
hookah rigs.
You got all that?
Ain't no thing.
No? What about a boat that's
already dialed in with electronics?
Not a problem.
Please don't put me on hold.
I need a magnetometer,
I need a side scan sonar.
I can set you up with
that whole boat over there.
Sonar, blower,
the whole ball of wax, man.
But you gotta pay.
How much?
Thirty grand.
Hello? Hello? Are you there?
What's he doing?
He's tripping me out.
No, he's the bank. He's putting
together the funds. Thirty grand?
Thirty grand.
I'll give you two weeks.
I'll carry the note.
You do good, you get the toys.
What do you mean, a meeting?
He's a criminal.
Criminals don't have meetings.
Look, no, don't hang...
What's up?
I can't believe this guy. The nerve.
I cannot understand it.
I basically saved this guy's life.
Ten years at Leavenworth,
and I get him off.
He can't float me
a couple thousand dollars.
So, what are you saying?
You don't have any money?
You're tapped out?
Dude, I told you about Vegas.
But you told me it was no big deal.
You told me it wasn't a problem.
I lied. Yeah.
I lied. I got a pride problem.
Why didn't you tell me that?
Tell you what? What do you
wanna hear, my sob story?
Here it is, Jared. I borrowed money
from the wrong people.
I took out a loan
and now I'm really weighed down.
Yeah, you should've told me
you didn't have any money.
You gonna float my marker?
You gonna cash in
all your Subway stamps?
I'm just...
Why didn't you tell me, bro?
Why did we come here
if you don't have any money?
Wasting our time.
This is bullshit.
Bye.
Hey, it's me.
I got some info that might kick you
in the balls and make you cough.
Yo, check this out.
Look.
Where's Amanda?
She's with you.
Give me your tank.
What's going on?
Give me a tank.
She's not with you?
Give me that tank. Come on.
Jesus Christ.
Come on.
Tank, tank, tank.
What are you doing in here?
What do you think I'm doing?
I was looking for your stupid ship.
I turned around, and you disappeared.
So I came in here looking for you.
What?
I told you to stay away from the plane.
I didn't take anything.
You wanna search me?
Here, go ahead.
We're out of here.
Salt water converts silver
into silver sulfide...
...and electrolytic reduction
reverses the process.
Whatever, bro. Just hurry up
and turn it back into treasure.
It's an old cap-and-ball.
That's a old-school gun right there.
Let me see that.
See the hammer, the trigger?
What is this...? These markings?
Give it to the Mexican.
What does that say?
You're such an ass.
That's not Spanish.
Let me see it.
Oh, it's Latin. "Sic semper tyrannis."
"Thus always a tyrant."
What? Catholic boarding school.
So, what, it's a Roman ship?
Seventeenth-century lndian dagger?
I don't think so.
No, this is an American ship.
Here it is, right here.
"Sic semper tyrannis:
thus ever to tyrants."
You were close.
"The motto of Virginia...
...said to have been shouted
by John Wilkes Booth...
...after he had assassinated
Abraham Lincoln in 1865."
Jared. Check this out.
Doesn't that look like a map
of New Providence?
That's this island, right?
Yeah.
Silver powder horn.
Silver horn and two silver guns.
What?
"Later they confirmed it was
the slave-pirate...
...by the silver horn and two
silver guns he was never without."
And this was his, right here.
Whose?
Tillman Thorp's.
The runaway slave turned pirate.
He was crazy. He ran the Everglades.
He and his crew were gnarly.
They ate alligators, drank lead...
...pissed musket balls, gave the
Confederates hell. lt was like revenge.
He just worked them.
So this is Snoop Dogg Silver.
These are the homies
over here, chilling.
Look at that guy drinking a 40.
Chilling?
Chilling. Yeah.
So, what do you think we got?
Some Confederate flags and old
Skynyrd tapes down there or what?
No, I don't think we found his ship.
I think we found the Zephyr.
Yeah?
Yeah.
The Zephyr was a clipper ship
owned by this wealthy...
...French trader, lived in New Orleans.
The war broke out, and he freaked out.
He takes his ship, family,
throws them onboard.
His antiques, valuables, gold, silver,
whatever he's got, onboard.
They try to make a beeline
for France.
Okay, but Mr. Two Guns and a Horn
here screws up his itinerary, right?
The ship wasn't all he took. He also
took the Frenchman's daughter.
He kidnapped her?
No. She ran away with him.
Long after the ship was sunk...
...they were spotted living together
in Eleuthera.
Oh, my God, this is a fairy tale.
They knew the French
would catch up...
...so they sunk the ship
to throw them off their trail.
Right. Gave up the gold for a girl.
Stop kissing.
First of all, it's disgusting.
Stop kissing. No self-respecting pirate
would do that, okay?
That's ridiculous.
Ten-to-one, this guy got so deep...
...into that fine,
white, French "poo-needy"...
"Needy"?
"Needada," that he took his eyes...
...off the road and crashed,
splash, right into a rock.
Guys.
That's what happened.
This is my new Romeo, right here.
It's reality.
I really don't care what happened.
The bottom line is,
the Zephyr's down there.
And if we found it...
...we have hit the mother lode
of mother lodes.
What kind of mother lode are we
talking about here? For real. Reality.
Tens of millions.
In 1861.
Sounds like hundreds of millions.
More.
That's insane.
Okay, this is the hook, though.
If we want it to be ours,
clean and clear...
...like, legal, no ifs, ands or buts...
...we have to come up with something
that says "the Zephyr" on it. Anything.
No, no.
What we need to do...
...is figure out what thousands
of millions divided by four equals.
That's what we need to figure out.
God, it's so crazy.
I can't imagine.
Hey, Amanda,
you're gonna stay topside.
Why?
Because you need to keep
an eye open for visitors.
Well, I still get my cut, right?
Of course, baby.
We're all equal partners.
All right. I'll stay up here
and I will work on my tan.
Tie on.
Everything okay out here?
Yeah. Yeah.
You sure?
Yeah, you know, just trying
to even out my naughty bits.
Can you cover yourself up, miss?
Sure.
Do you have any drugs
or weapons onboard?
No, I don't.
This is Bahamian water.
We have the right
to search the boat.
Sir, I found something.
Looks like prescription drugs to me.
Are these yours?
No, they're not mine.
What's your name, miss?
Amanda.
Yo, is everything cool?
Jared?
Hey.
Yeah, everything is cool.
I didn't recognize the boat.
Yeah, it's a friend of mine's.
Hey, Sam, how you doing?
Hey, Roy.
Good.
How's Allison and Emily?
They're good, good.
All right, guys, wrap it up.
Roy, this is my friend, Bryce.
Hey, Bryce.
How you doing?
That's Amanda up there.
We met. How you doing?
What happened
to your friend's arm?
Oh, I just... Got a little too close
to the fire coral.
Better wrap that up good.
Why didn't you have
a "diver down" flag?
Yeah, I know, I just...
I got lazy, man, you know.
There's not a lot of boat traffic
out here, just a bunch of jellyfish.
And drug traffickers.
Flying their planes in from Colombia...
...dropping loads in the water.
You know. Boat like this...
We just saw a shark fin and,
I don't know, I couldn't resist.
Wanted to show these mainlanders
a real shark.
Yeah.
Didn't really think too much about it.
Right. Nice.
Yeah.
Came a little too close.
I almost pissed in my Speedo.
You crazy. If I saw a shark...
...I'd be like Jesus of Nazareth
and run across that water.
You hear what I'm saying?
All right, brother. All right, girl.
Can't wait to see the girls.
All right.
Take care of that arm.
I will.
See you, Roy.
All right, guys, let's go.
Bye, guys. Have a good day.
Bye. Bye, boys. Thanks.
If everything pans out correctly,
we're gonna be doing a fifty-fifty split.
That's half for me,
and half for you and Sam.
Well, what do you mean?
Don't say it. Do not say it.
Amanda? Not family. You, I? Family.
Amanda, not family.
You'd cu...? You'd cut her out?
Yeah.
Guaranteed, she's telling everyone.
She's gonna talk?
Yeah.
No, if she talks, we'll...
We'll have her in the Special Olympics
next year. She's not gonna talk.
Guys.
Let's go. Now. Come on.
What?
Protect my ass. Come on.
Hey. I gotta go cool off.
What?
Hey, Jared.
Hey, what's up, Danny?
Listen, some pointy-looking dreads
been asking for you.
It was freaking me out a little.
They was all up in my mouth, like,
you know, "Where you been diving?
Who you been hanging out with?"
What did you tell them?
I didn't say shit. I don't know nothing.
I got your back, dog. Trust me on that.
But they don't look like they
from around here, that's for sure.
Yeah, well, I appreciate
the heads up. Thanks.
Everything cool?
Yeah.
Yeah, everything's cool. Thanks,
though, Danny. I appreciate it.
Wet white guy coming through.
Oh, here he comes. Here he comes.
Where's Amanda?
I don't know.
No?
Hey, my man. My man.
My man. Girl's with me.
Just talking to the lady, my boy.
I'm just telling you she's with me.
Baby, it's cool.
What's cool?
This is Primo. He owns this joint.
What's up, my man?
No, we're good, bro. We're good.
Great.
Come on.
Hey, you wanna...?
You wanna do a little...? Little bump?
Yeah, yeah, let's do a bump.
That shit's for losers.
You know what I mean? Let's go.
Ask her how she was
gonna pay for it.
How she was gonna pay for it?
Yeah. Ask how she was gonna pay.
Here, hold this.
Hey, hey.
Oh, shit.
Watch out. Watch out.
Get out of the way.
Get out of the way!
Hey.
Hey, cut it out.
Talk to your boy, Jared.
Primo...
Talk to your boy.
Come on.
Chill out.
You're a bitch.
Don't.
I'll murder you, boy.
Jared, this just sucks.
What's your problem, Bryce?
I ain't got a problem.
What's your problem?
What are you looking at?
He's not the guy to pick a fight with.
I didn't pick a fight.
No, he didn't pick a fight.
I didn't do it.
He just punched the guy.
Shut up. Shut up.
You're awesome. Real tough.
You know what, you shut up.
And don't screw this up.
Okay, I'm so... I'm sorry, okay?
I'm sorry. I apologize.
All set, let's go, come on.
Come on.
You all right? You all right?
All right, let's go, let's go.
Get the heck out of here, man.
Mother flip.
My jaw must be broken.
What the hell was that all about?
Okay, let's gather around here.
You wanna stay away from the ropes.
Now, you guys know what these are?
No.
They're called "mailboxes."
Hit it.
Now, watch this.
We use the mailboxes to deflect
the prop wash, right?
To blow away sand and debris
so we can find sunken ships.
All right? Now... Hey.
Oh, my God, what is that?
What is that?
It's a pirate.
It's a pirate.
It's a pirate.
What does he have?
Treasure.
Treasure.
There we go.
Yeah, enough chocolate
for everybody.
Like I told you,
I'm not a treasure hunter, I'm a...?
Treasure finder.
Finder! Yeah.
Bye, pirates.
Bye.
Bye. Thank you.
Hey, absolutely. lt was a blast.
I hope you guys come back.
Thank you.
See you guys later.
Bye.
Have fun back at school.
Hey, Jared. What's up, man?
The Bonzel was that wreck
you found off Mysterioso Bank.
What's going on, captain?
Don't know.
Jared here found a hat. Seems pretty
excited about it, you know?
I don't normally buy back
old souvenirs I sell, but, you know...
...if you need the dough
and, you know...
Just tell your boys to back off.
My boys?
You boys been bothering this man?
No, sir, captain.
I got over 100 people that worked
for me on the Bonzel.
I sold a shitload of hats...
...so this could belong to anybody.
Just stay away from us, okay?
Look, you're the one who boarded
my boat without permission.
You realize people still get shot
for that down here?
Time and money, Jared.
That's what it takes to bring stuff up
from the bottom of the sea. I got both.
What do you got?
Borrowed time and a borrowed dime?
That must suck.
All right, you take care.
Drive safe.
Do you realize it's just a matter of time
until Bates finds that wreck.
Meantime, we're crawling around
the bottom of the ocean...
...digging for treasure
with spoons, man.
Yeah, and I know...
...where to get the money
to get the stuff that we need...
...only I can't go down
and get it by myself.
No, we've already talked
about that.
But what are we talking about?
What are we talking about?
We're not talking about a lot.
We're talking about just enough
to get what we need.
Look at me right now in my face and
tell me you haven't thought about it.
Well, you know l've thought about it.
But have you thought about
the penalties here for drug trafficking?
I know what they are.
They throw you under the prison.
Nope. Nope. Maximum...
Maximum first-time offense
for trafficking, Jared?
You know what it is? Five years.
Five years, Jared.
It took me longer to get through
law school and pass the bar.
Only five years, huh?
Yeah.
Man, you wouldn't last five days
in Fox Hill Prison.
You know what, man?
We're risking our lives.
We're risking our lives
every single day...
Iooking for a 150-year-old ship
that might be buried...
...under the bottom of the ocean,
while 100 million, easy...
...easy, sits in a plane
We could get that money we need
to get that boat.
And what do we do? Keep swimming
on by it like it doesn't even exist.
Tell me what's crazy.
Jesus Chri...
Jared, l've dealt with these people.
I defended these people.
These people who move
tons of this shit.
They're not gifted people, Jared.
This is not rocket science.
And I'm not a drug dealer.
No. You are not a drug dealer.
You're a 29-year-old dive bum.
You are.
I'm serious, man. What's so funny?
You live in a trailer.
You got a boat on blocks.
Okay? And you got 50 bucks
to your name on a good day.
I mean, come on. Well, Sam... Sam.
How long you think a girl like Sam
will stick around if you don't fix that?
Sam is not like that.
They're all like that.
Sam isn't.
Okay.
Look, I love you to death.
The whole flip-flop-and-board-short
thing is cute now...
...but what about when you're
the old man sitting at the bar...
...and nothing in your pocket
but sand...
...and you're drooling and you're
going on and on about how you...
You were the one
who found the Zephyr.
It was you until Bates came along...
...and he stole that shit right from
under you. You gonna be that guy?
You know what, Jared? Winners.
Winners make the rules,
and losers live by them.
What are we talk...?
It's a one-time thing, man.
It's a one-time thing.
Means to an end.
That's all it is.
Where are you going?
What, the conversation's
done now, Jared?
Jared?
He didn't go for it.
You wanna keep tricking
or you wanna start pimping?
I think it matters.
What matters?
The legend.
About the pirate and the girl.
I think it matters that he gave up
the treasure for love.
You do?
Sure.
Don't let Bryce hear you say that.
What about you?
Would you give up treasure
for love?
Like it's even a question.
I'd definitely take the treasure.
You're an ass. You would.
No way. No way.
Yes, you would.
We have a good life. A great one.
You should ask yourself
what's missing in your life...
...that money will get you.
All right, hit it.
We good?
Hold on. Hold on. Now.
Hey, guys.
How's it going?
Like shit.
What you gonna do about it?
I have a feeling I'm gonna
make it all better, baby.
Winning. Winning. What's that, bro?
What you gonna do?
What'd you do if I sock you
in your face, homeboy?
What if I sock you...?
What if I sock you in...?
What if I sock you
right in your head?
Yeah. No, no.
We're good, right? It's all good?
What's that?
You want the one-two-three?
One-two-three?
What are you gonna do, bro?
Get out of the car, Opie.
What?
I gotta go, man.
You gotta go?
I gotta go to work. My baby mama
harassing me for a new weave.
All right, see you, Danny.
I'll see you later, all right?
Yeah.
Yeah?
Hey. What's up, bro? It's me.
Hey, what's going on?
Can you meet me somewhere now?
Yeah, where at?
Now, stop that.
Hey, what's up?
This him?
Yeah. He's a local. I know him.
He's okay.
What's going on?
You tell me.
Here's the deal. Don't give me
that look. Everything's fine.
It's fine. It's fine.
These guys... Everything's cool.
They thought I was Babylon,
I'm clearly not.
So everything's good now,
right, brothers? Right?
Come on. Hey, come on.
Mr. Nobody, from nowhere,
tried to crash my party...
...without an invitation.
I need someone to vouch for him
before we nail his coffin shut.
You found my plane, didn't you?
Okay, now, you see that?
Look, let... Do we have a deal or not?
Because I mean, it's...
No, we don't.
So what's...? I mean, F you.
ls there a problem?
Is there a problem?
Yeah.
You sound like you work in retail.
Yes, there is a problem.
It takes balls, stealing my cocaine
and trying to sell it back to me.
Your cocaine. Okay.
That's something we didn't know.
Now, listen up. Listen up.
I swear on my...
I don't care how my stuff
found its way back to me.
I just want it back. All of it.
That is all of it.
No, this stuff don't come in six-packs.
Well, that's all we found.
That's all we found.
There is 800 kilos in that plane...
...and I want every brick of it
in 12 hours' time.
Primo tells me the ocean
is your soccer field.
Me, I never leave this boat.
So this is how it's gonna be.
You are gonna swim back down
to the octopus's garden...
...get the rest of it and bring it to me.
Then we'll talk numbers.
There's a lot of boats buzzing around
out there, looking for my plane.
If you get caught
and you give them my name...
...I'm gonna come after those
you love most.
Okay?
No, it's not okay.
Did you say something?
We don't have the equipment
we need to haul the rest up...
...and it's gonna cost...
...30,000, nonrefundable,
to get the rest of it.
Give him the money.
You have 12 hours.
Spend it wisely.
That was intense.
Hey, hey.
Hey. Okay.
I can't believe you.
Okay. All right.
You put everyone's life in jeopardy.
What's wrong with you?
I don't understand. I don't
understand what the problem is.
We go down there,
we go down in that wreck...
...we bring up some coke,
we deal with these morons...
...and then in a month
we're on the Discovery Channel...
...up to our knees in treasure,
smiling, like this.
What's the problem?
It better be that simple.
And if anything happens to Sam,
I swear I'm gonna kill you.
Come on.
Sam, it's all good. This helps.
This is not a problem.
Jared hooked it up. It's all good.
I told you she wouldn't be into it.
She's so clean, she squeaks.
Shut up, you coke whore.
Sam.
Very nice.
Amanda, stop. All right?
We're all in this together now, right?
Not me. Not anymore.
Bye.
Sam.
Hey, Sam.
Sam.
See you on the 10:00 news.
What?
You heard me.
Sam, come on, what are you doing?
What is wrong with you?
A week ago you had too much integrity
to work for Scuba Bob...
...and now you're working
for frigging drug dealers?
Yeah, but...
I believe in you more than
in the prospect of any treasure.
If we do this just this one time...
...we salvage the Zephyr
and it's over. That's it.
It's already over.
Oh, come on,
what are you talking about?
Sam, come on.
Sam, come on.
Yeah, you ready, Bryce?
All right, hit it, Jared.
Turn it off. Turn it...
Hey, Bryce, you okay?
Let me get the sand out of my ass
and I'll tell you exactly how I am.
You see anything?
Bryce, you hear me?
I see something.
Keep it going, keep it going,
keep it going. Yes, yes, yes.
Keep it going.
Bingo, baby.
Cut it, cut it, cut it.
Bryce, how are we doing?
Come down, come down.
Baby, here we come.
Yes, yes.
Oh, my God, look at this.
Let's go find the gold,
the G-old.
Blow, baby, blow.
All right, now suck.
Hey, over here.
What? What is it?
You got gold? What?
Hell, no.
What's that say? What's that say?
Read that shit, bitch.
Look at that. What's that say?
Zephyr. Zephyr. Zephyr.
That's what we need,
the name on something, right?
That's it right there, baby,
that's the claim and the fame.
Now let's go find the gold
and get paid.
Where's the cheddar? The golden
cheddar? The old-gay eddar-chay?
Jared, where are you going? We need
to find the cheddar cheese, the gold.
Amanda, come here, come here.
Look at... Look at the P. Diddy juice.
Keep it crispy. Pop the top.
I can't take this mask off.
Let's go upstairs. Come on.
Whatever.
Would you give up treasure
for love?
Would you give up treasure
for love?
I love you.
Give me the bags.
Hey. Hey, Chico, get the yeyo, man.
I've never seen so much yeyo
in my life.
Lots of cheese.
Look at all the cheese.
Come on, let's just get this done.
Take it to the line.
It's heavier than I thought it would be.
All right, I need another bag.
Listen, I'm gonna bring up this load
and the bell. Keep filling the bags.
Bryce, I need another one, come on.
Here you go.
Jesus Christ. Shit. Jared!
Hey, Bryce, come back.
Jared!
Oh, no.
What? What's wrong?
Jared. Jared, you gotta...
Oh, no. Oh, no, what happened?
Take off her BC.
Help me out.
Get her on the boat.
Turn her over.
Oh, dear God.
Oh, shit. We're getting
out of here, come on.
Was she a certified diver?
You know, I don't know.
What about yourself?
Are you a certified diver?
Look, ma'am... Ma'am, I'm a lawyer.
I'm sorry.
I'm just glad you're okay.
I love you.
We gotta get back down there
and get that stuff.
It's down there, just waiting for us.
Shut up, Bryce.
Why don't you shut up, Sam.
Why don't you shut up, okay?
You put us through all this.
Would you...?
This wouldn't have happened
if it weren't for you. Get it?
Yes, I got it. Great.
Now we're here, so let's go.
The quicker we go down there
and get them off our backs...
...the quicker we can get
our treasure.
Amanda's dead, and you're
still thinking about treasure.
I've known her for five days.
Five days.
You are such an asshole.
Why am I an asshole?
What do you want me to do, Sam?
You want me to wear an armband?
Go into mourning? Plan a funeral?
I'm a terrible person. That's what it is.
I'm a terrible person, Sam.
Yeah.
You got it?
Who is it?
You got the product?
Wait, who is it?
Man, we ran into some complications.
You got it or not?
No.
Then we have a problem,
Scuba-Doo.
Look at me when I'm talking to you.
He's got a gun.
Go, go, go.
Go, Jared. Watch those kids.
Make a right, make a right.
Slow down, slow down, slow down.
Come on, Jared. Jared.
I'm going for it.
Jared.
Oh, shit.
Shit.
You okay?
Jared? Jared?
Jared, he's coming.
Jared?
Hey, I'm sorry.
Jared, here he comes. Get in the car.
What are you doing?
I'm gonna take him out.
Jared?
Yo, he's gonna hit the car. Back up.
Back up, man.
I'm going, I'm going.
You'll hit my car. What you doing?
Jesus' sake.
I got it, I got it.
Get him. The man move.
Oh, man.
What are you doing?
Go to Shoreline Cove. I'll meet you.
Jared...
Sam, you drive.
No. Jar... It's not safe.
Bro, don't be a hero. Be a coward.
Be a coward, get in the car.
Drive. I need you to drive.
Sam, get in the car.
What are you gonna do?
I'll meet up with you. Bryce, you drive.
I'll see you there. I'll be okay. Drive.
No. No... Fuck.
This boy a madman.
Him a madman here.
Sam, where is this place?
Right up here.
All right, slow down.
Where you going?
This is what we should've done
a long time ago.
Hey.
Oh, what are you doing?
What's going on? Where you been?
Where's Jared?
Can we talk for a minute?
What's going on?
Stupid. So stupid.
Go. Just go. Just go.
Sorry, Sam.
Here you go.
What this?
This is from a sunken ship
full of treasure.
Easily worth 10 times more
than your boss's coke.
And you guys can have all of it,
if you forget you ever met us.
Let's see if we can make a deal.
This is serious, Sam.
If I go to the wrong person
with this, right?
I got the chief of police in my
back yard right now. We're coworkers.
And I don't even know
if I can trust them.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to drag you into this.
I just... I... I didn't know
who else to go to.
Let me make a call.
I might know somebody
who may be able to help.
Okay?
Get down.
Memo.
Well, I see you've met
my business partner.
You have something
that belongs to me, Jared?
No, don't shoot.
There he is. Use the solid.
Go get him.
Man, this boy, he gotta be
around here somewhere.
See him over there, mate?
What it is, man.
No sign of him yet, boss.
Brother's got skills.
Forget about him.
Get back to the boat.
Everything's gonna be all right.
What about Jared?
Oh, Jared, he'll be okay.
Trust me, Reyes is done. Over.
He won't be a problem anymore
for anyone.
Thank you, Roy.
You don't have to thank me, Sam.
This is the guy right here.
Bates?
Hey, Bryce.
Where's Sam?
What the hell happened to you?
The hell with that. Where's Sam at?
She went to... To the cops, bro.
She went to Roy. I couldn't stop her.
She just jumped right out of the car.
Give me your phone.
Why? What's up?
I'm gonna call Sam.
What's going on?
Reyes and Primo are dead.
Bates killed them.
What do you mean,
Bates killed them?
Reyes and Bates were partners.
We found their lost coke, and Reyes
tried to cut Bates out of the deal.
So Bates doesn't look
for treasure, really.
No, he's been looking for his plane,
been moving drugs this whole time.
Hello.
Hey, who's this?
Jared. Hi. Listen,
I just wanted to say...
...that I am really, really sorry
about all this.
Your girlfriend says she doesn't
know where my plane is.
Either she's a good liar
or she likes pain.
Not sure. You know her better
than I do. What do you think?
Hey, Derek, why don't you
just let her go.
Well, you tell me where my plane is
and she walks.
Let me talk to her for a minute.
I would.
I would let you talk to her right now,
but she's got this thing in her mouth.
Look, you want me to show you
where your coke is?
No, no, no. Not show, Jared. Tell.
You give me the coordinates right now
and Sam walks off this boat.
No, I'm gonna tell you
how it's gonna go.
This isn't a partnership, Jared.
No, that's exactly what this is.
Fifty-fifty.
If you want your coke, meet me
three klicks due south of Easter Point.
All right. I will see you there.
Oh, and Jared...
...you saw what happened to the
last partner who tried to screw me.
Remember when I said if anything
happened to Sam, I'd kill you?
Oh, don't do that.
Don't hit me with the fucking chair.
You told me this would be easy.
This would be a one-time thing.
Yeah. Okay, it didn't go the way
I planned it. All right? lt went wrong.
Yeah, this was all wrong.
If I didn't have such a sweet tooth...
...I would kill you. Right now.
Bates.
Yes, Roy?
What?
You got what you wanted, right?
She's had enough.
I see.
You're the one
who was right on top of it...
...when you stopped them
the other day, right?
And you're the one
that didn't log the location.
Was that you?
I told you it didn't merit the attention.
I believe them.
They're friends of mine.
They are friends of mine too.
I'm not the one who put the gun
to your head.
Did I make you settle with those guys
for that extra cash? Did I do that?
Oh, no, you did. You were there,
Jared, too, just like me.
Your eyes were spinning.
Gold bars. Same as mine. No?
I'm sorry, Jared.
I screwed up.
Man, I screwed up.
I was the one that screwed up.
Bates know I'm still here?
Hey, Danny, we need a favor.
Jared? Bryce?
What are y'all doing here?
Come on, help me tie on.
Oh, yeah, man, no problem.
There he comes.
Sam!
All right. She's job security.
Now, if you want her to live,
you take me to my plane...
...you dive with us.
lt'll be like old times.
Let her go and I'll sweeten the deal.
Sweet...? With what? That shipwreck
in your back yard? What, your dog?
You have nothing to give me, Jared.
I found the Zephyr.
What?
And I'll let you have the claim.
I brought you here to save her life,
not to get her killed.
Hundreds of millions...
The Zephyr doesn't exist.
...it's all yours, if you want.
If you let Sam go. lt does exist.
It's not a myth.
It's not a myth?
You want it? Then let her go.
Okay.
Then let her go right now.
Sam, let's go. We're out of here.
Go.
Let her go.
Sam, he gave up the gold
and they got away.
He found the Zephyr.
Maybe we'll meet up
in Never-Never Land...
...because I heard the tooth fairy
was gonna be there.
Santa Claus is coming, you know,
with my coke.
So how long you been
a drug trafficker?
I'm a salvor, Jared,
the same as l've always been.
But investors don't like it
when you come back...
...to shore with nothing
but empty fuel tanks and a sunburn.
All right, is this it?
Throttle down.
Throttle down.
Why did you have to put me
in this situation, Jared?
I mean, what am I supposed to do
with you and Sam now?
Pay us a finder's fee.
Yeah, see, now you sound like
a man who has a future.
The way I see it, Bates, you're the one
whose days are numbered.
You got this big ship and crew,
all this fancy gear...
...and you couldn't even find
your own plane.
That must suck.
Hey, captain,
there's something up ahead.
Do you see it?
Right up there, 2 o'clock.
Raolo, slow down, man.
Right here, captain.
Now who's the treasure finder?
What the hell is this, Jared?
That's half your coke, captain.
Now I'm gonna go down
and destroy the rest of it.
Suit up!
Hey, crane's out. I'm going below.
Shit.
No. No, no, no.
No.
Oh, Lordy, Lordy. Hey, hey.
Oh, today's your lucky day.
Hey, boss, just the man I want to see.
You see how big this baby is?
What you saying?
We got divers in the water.
What divers, man?
I is the only diver out here.
Come on, you and the wife
can grill this up tonight.
I say leave. Now.
Do you copy?
Patrol. Message for
patrol boat five. Over.
This is patrol boat five. Control...
Come here. Come here.
Mayday! Mayday!
This is Sea Robin.
Twenty-five...
Sea Robin, do you copy?
Sea Robin, do you copy?
Sea Robin,
please repeat your position.
Sea Robin, do you copy?
Sea Robin,
please repeat your position.
Jared!
Hey, Boone.
All right, we're good to go.
ls it all bueno?
Go ahead, bring it up.
Here it comes.
A little bit more.
Up, up. All right, there we go.
Jared?
That's all right. Keep going.
A little more, Bryce.
Why?
Oh, well. Let's come back tomorrow.
What do you mean?
I got everything I need right here.
Bryce?
What the hell?
What's he doing?
What a jagoff.
Hey!
I got the cheese.
What?
I have the dough.
What?
I have gold.
You found the gold?
Yeah!
