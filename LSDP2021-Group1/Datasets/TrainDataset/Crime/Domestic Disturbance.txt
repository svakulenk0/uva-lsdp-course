All right ! Let her go !
It floats
Not bad, uh ?
It's fantastic
Can I get on ?
You paid for her
I'm the one who has to
ask permission to board
Go ahead
Here you go
Frank
No
I'll take one of these
To Frank Morrison
for building us the most
beautiful boat
in the water
Thank you ! Thank you !
That boat was the
bargain of the century
I made a price,
kept the price
And if you build
any more at that price
you'll go out of business
Theresa,
I should explain to
you my theory of
noble failure
But Danny's got
a game
See you
So how come
your boyfriend's
not coming
with you?
Danny said he wouldn't play
if he saw Rick in the stands
He's really got it in
for the guy, doesn't he?
Coach ! Coach !
How are you?
Hey, Frank,
how's it going ?
Where's Dan ?
He isn't here
Why not?
I asked him to stay,
but he chose to leave
I don't know where
he went yeah
This is
Frank Morrison
Oh, really?
What is that Danny?
Okay, we'll be there
He's at the police
station
Mom ! Dad !
I can't believe you
would stow away in some
complete stranger's car
Where did you think
you were going ?
No... Anywhere, What
difference does it make?
Christ, Danny,
what are you thinking ?
What's the big deal ?
I'm sorry, okay?
I just didn't feel like
playing today, so I booked
Mr. and Mrs. Morrison
Please come in
Wait here
The first time
we picked him up,
it was for breaking windows
Danny insisted that we
had the wrong kid
He wanted to hire a
lawyer, we remember
That was two years ago
after you guys separated
Six months later we got
him in here for truancy
That was right after - Right
after we got our divorce, yes
All this acting out is
Danny's way of
trying to get us
back together
Look we've
logged a lot of
hours a
lot of counsellors
Clearly, it hasn't
done us any good
Any idea what set him
off this time?
Yes, I'm sure it's because
I'm getting remarried
Oh, boy
who's the lucky guy?
Rick Barnes
I know Rick
Of course, you do
Everybody does
Congratulations then
Well, they do, honey
Your mom's
getting married
I know you don't
like it I get it
But you're not going to
use it as an
excuse to get wild
Okay, Dad
No, I'm not kidding,
Danny
Your mother's got a right
to move on with her life
I think you ought to give
this guy a break
What do you think?
Dad, do you ever wish that
things could be like they were?
Well, Danny, maybe you
don't remember,
But things weren't all
that great
I remember you were
home every day
Yeah, I know
The truth is, your mother
and I tried hard to make
it work out but we were
arguing all the time
and frankly
I didn't think I was doing
you any favours by
sticking around
Guess what?
The mast is up on the
big boat
So we're still going
sailing Saturday?
Yeah, you bet
Great
See you Saturday
Saturday
Frank, will you hold on
for a second ?
I'm sorry, Mom
It's okay, sweetheart
I love you
I love you, too
Bye, Dad
All right, so he said that
he would give Rick a break
At least it's something
Yeah, cool, thank you
Your're still taking him
sailing on Saturday?
Yeah, why?
It's just that Danny
takes his cues from you
And I thought that maybe
if you asked Rick to go
sailing with you guys
Jesus Susan I mean,
giving him a pep talk is
one thing
But taking your fiance
sailing with us?
Come on ! Jeez !
I'm sorry
I shouldn't have asked
Damn it
You okay?
Yeah, I'm okay
Susan asked me to take
Rick sailing with us this weekend
So Danny and he can bond
Maybe it's a good idea
What ?
Danny needs to
accept the fact
that his mom is
getting remarried
And you're going to have
to accept it too, Frank
I have no problem
accepting it
I don't want to hang out
with the guy, that's all
So what really bothers
you about sailing with Rick?
You afraid that Danny
might get to like him?
Maybe I don't want him
bonding with him
Maybe I don't want him
to have a new dad
Remember my friend,
His ex-wife ran away
with Keith Barrel,
the football player ?
We'll his kid admired
the guy so much
That he took his name
And then
eventually stopped
seeing his
dad altogether
Come on, Frank, Danny
loves you. You're his Dad
Diane,
these things happen
And Rick Barnes
Ever since he got in
town, everyone's just
falling all over him just
cause he's loaded
He's got more than just
money, Frank
Yeah, what?
According to everyone,
he's a very nice guy
Well, I'm a nice guy, too
but no one's falling
all over -Yes, you are
I'm just a boat builder
A poor boat builder at that
All right, it's just
like a car, okay?
You turn left to go left,
and right to go
Port
No, that's left
Right, right, right
And that's starboard
I know what you mean
Maybe we should stick
to lefts and rights
That way
That I understand
I'm impressed, Danny
You know a lot about
boats, man
You know, my Dad and I,
we spend a lot of time
out here
I can see why,
It's beautiful
Thanks for including me
today, I'm having fun
No problem
There are so many
beautiful places in the world
How did you end up here?
I invested in this
pharmaceutical company
They came out with this
new blood pressure medicine
Stock just went through
the roof
It was like winning
the lottery
It gave me a
chance to do
something different
with my life
You know, Frank, I'd never
try to take your place with him
I just want a shot at
being his friend
I tell you what
There are two
things you have to
remember with a kid
Number one
you have to show them
that you love them
Number two,
give them stuff
You mean bribe him, right?
If you bought him a new
baseball g love,
you'd be right in with him
Sounds like a plan
Danny ! Ready about !
Pull it in. There you go
See you, Rick
See you later, Dan
Frank, you know the sea
Cliff Resort at Buzzard's Bay?
The dump? Sure
What about it?
Actually
I just bought it
It's beautiful
The idea is to
try to turn it
into something beautiful
How would
you feel about
building me
some boats?
We're so busy lately
Come on
Frank You would
be doing me a favour
I'll think about it
So
Are you maybe feeling
a little bit better
about your mom
marrying Rick, or what?
I guess, yeah
Good
But I'm still not going
to the wedding ?
Why is that?
It would just
be too weird
watching mom
get married
You have to go
Cause you're
going to break your
mother's heart
if you don't
You going ?
No, but that's different
We were married
It's different
See? It's too weird for
you, too
You're right, you're right
Okay, I tell you what,
I'll go if you go
Deal ?
Deal
Good, we'll make fun
of them together
Yeah
Susan sure did hit the
jackpot
I'm kidding, Frank
Hey, Dad
Look at you
You are so handsome
I'm doing great, I guess
Wait, I got to show
you what Rick got me
I'll be right back
Dad !
It's a Cal Ripken g love
That's great
Everyone please
take your seats
The ceremony is
about to begin
Danny
time to get ready
Hey, folks, look over here
Susan
do you take Rick to be
your lawfully
wedded husband
for richer, for poorer, in
sickness and in health
till death do you part?
I do
Rick, do you take Susan
to be your lawfully
wedded wife
for richer, for poorer
in sickness and in health,
till death do you part?
I do
I now pronounce you
husband and wife
You may kiss the bride
You're a trooper
I'm proud of you
Appreciate you coming
Friend of Rick's
Congratulations
Long time no see
Yeah, Ray, we got a lot
of catching up to do
I can't wait
Thanks for dressing up
You look beautiful
Thank you
Congratulations
I'm glad you came
Thanks
Who's your buddy?
He's an old business
acquaintance
I'm surprised he even
showed up
I know,
you looked surprised
What do you mean ?
You just looked surprised
Diet Coke and champagne
to go
How are you?
You're a friend of Rick's,
right?
That's right
Frank Morrison
Ray Coleman
Nice wedding, huh ?
She must know some
pretty good tricks to make
old Rick settle down
That's my ex-wife Susan
You ex?
You're kidding me
No
So where are you from?
Bay area, California
Came all the way out here
for the wedding, huh ?
I had some business
in DC
So how long you know
Rick?
We go way back, went
to school together
Really?
What about it?
Oh, nothing
He told me
that you were
in business together,
or something
Excuse me, Frank
Catch you later
It really is too bad
What's that, Ray?
You registered
I saw the gift table
Registered at Crate and
Barrel, wow
The dishes, table cloths,
soup tureens
You registered for a
soup tureen ?
That's what I would've
got you if I'd been
invited earlier
In fact, I could have
been your best man
I appreciate we got some
things to discuss here, Ray
But now's not a good
time
Are you busy?
What I'm going to do
is put you
up in a motel for a while
outside of town, and
I'll get in touch with you
in a couple of days
Why can't I stay here?
You've got plenty of room
That's not a good idea,
Ray
I'm very lucky, Danny
I'm fortunate to have
three great men in my life
Who's number one?
You are, sweetheart
You'll always be
number one
I'll see you guys later
Where you going ?
I got some shopping
to do
All right, well, have fun
Come on, Rick,
throw the ball
See you later,
sweetheart
Good catch
Come on, you could
have had that
I should have had that?
Yeah
You should have had
that
My g love, it's not
broken in all the way
G love's not broken
in yet, all right
Is your arm not broken
in yet?
That was practically
right to you, Rick
That was practically
right to me
My dad would have
had that
Who's you dad,
Shaquille O'Neal ?
He used to be captain
of his baseball team
He's great all sports
You know, your dad is
going to be working for me
I hired him to
build me some boats
Did he
tell you that?
No, he didn't
If your dad's such a
great baseball player,
how come
he never taught you
how to
throw a baseball ?
I can throw the ball
Then why are you
standing with
your feet like this
and putting the ball
everywhere where I'm not?
When you throw a
baseball, you point your
foot to somebody so
the ball goes to them
Just throw the ball
I'm going to throw
the ball
But I don't want to run
or jump for the ball
I want the ball to
come to me
Aim and concentrate
Take it easy !
I am taking it easy
How the hell are you
supposed to learn
anything out here?
Come on,
turn the ball loose
You throw like shit
You know, Rick, I don't
want to play anymore
Suit yourself. Bring the
g loves in when you're done
Don't ask me to play again
if you're going to be a brat !
You want about a half
inch up
Just trim it off like that
All your strokes are
even and forward
like so, right?
And you use the other
side of the brush, as well
This is the important
part, make sure that the
edges don't dry
Because then you'll
get distortion
No open spots
You ready to try it?
What if I mess up?
That's a very interesting
question, 'cause that's
what I asked my dad
And that's what he
asked his father
So do you know what your
great grandfather told
your grandfather who
told your father
who's telling you now?
What?
That's why God
invented sandpaper
So this is okay?
Yeah, it's very good
So what happened with
that whole window thing ?
I told Mom it was an
accident
Yeah, well, tell me it
was an accident
I just got mad, okay?
Why, because he had a
problem with the way
you threw a ball ?
No, he threw it hard and
he tried to hurt me
Come on, Danny, was it
any harder than a line
drive coming at you?
No
Maybe he was just trying
to prepare you for a real game
or something
Why do you have to work
for him, anyway?
Tell him you don't want
his money,
that you don't
need anything from him
I can't do that
Why not?
Because the truth is,
Dan
I love making these
wooden boats,
but people
don't want them anymore
When your
grandpa made them,
they'd line up
from here to Maine
Just to have one
But they want
plastic now
It's cheaper, they can
afford it
You understand ?
Yeah
I was in the donut shop
this morning
You know
who I saw?
You know that girl Katie
that you like,
what's her
last name?
Lewis? she was there
with a girlfriend
She was talking about
you, she said, he's nice
or something like that
Since she got her braces
off, she's a total babe
I know, and then she
said that she thought
your dad was a fox
Here you go, Frank
Have a nice day
You too
How's it going ?
Frank Morrison, I met
you at Rick's wedding
Jesus, of course !
Ray, right !
You want to sit down ?
Sure
Sorry Frank, yeah
I'm getting really bad
with faces
It must be early
Alzheimer's or something
It's been a while since
the wedding
I wouldn't worry about it
I was just surprised
you're still here
You said something
about just being
in for the day
Yeah, I decided
to stick around,
grab myself a little R& R
Tell you what, Frank,
now that I've been here
for a while
I can see why Rick really
fell in love with the place
I'm actually
thinking about
looking at some
real estate myself
No kidding
I kid you not
Well, if you're serious
about it, I know a realtor
Sam Jones, he'll hook
you up
You know that
I'm noticing ?
I haven't seen any adult
bookstores in this town
No kidding
I kid you not
Just the man I wanted
to see
I owe you a call
Good to see you
You're a busy man
If you weren't so busy,
you wouldn't be getting
Southport's Man
of the year award
Yeah, well, it's a slow
year, we all know that
right?
How's the backhand
coming ?
Coming along, want to
play tomorrow?
Let me give you a call
Give my best to
everybody
I will
Open up, Ray
What the hell were
How did you know
I was in town ?
What are you doing with
my wife's ex, Ray?
Having eggs
Why did she leave him?
He was great
Told him
I was thinking
about buying some
property here
And he offered to find
me a realtor
Maybe you and me
could be neighbors
I had a good reason for
wanting you to stay out
of town, Ray
You talk too much
You always have
Maybe I'm not the
only one
How do you think
I found you?
When we
were on the
inside doing
our little stretch
We'd all take our best
shots at imagining
Where you'd run off to
spend our money
You're lucky it was only
me who figured it out
or you would have had
all three of us for
wedding guests
What about Tommy
and John ?
What about them?
What are you going to
send them their share?
So? Don't you want to
know how I found you?
Yeah, of course I do,
Ray
I remember this one
time you were drunk
and telling me how
crappy your childhood was
Except for this one
summer you spent on
the Maryland coast
Where there was clean
air and friendly people
I ain't saying you were
easy to find
I mean, I only had a
general idea of where
to look
and a lot of times I
came this close to just
giving it up
But then
then you made the
papers
You know, I'll tell you
something, Ray
You know what I came to
hate most about working
outside the law?
Having to associate
with scumbags
You found yourself a
lawyer to get
yourself off
Maybe that makes you
smarter than me
doesn't make you better
I'll call you, Ray
I'm sick of you stalling
me, Jack !
I told you, Ray
it takes time to put
this kind of
money together
Name's Rick
It's funny how quick you
can forget a name
Rick
Stay out of town, Ray
You don't belong there
Well, I was right, the
doctor said pregnant
Baby, I'm so happy
That's so great
Oh, Susan, I bet you it's
going to be a boy, too
You want to
bet me on that?
What's wrong, honey?
Nothing
I just didn't expect it to
happen so soon,
that's all
You know how much I
wanted to have a baby
I'm happy
I know you do, I do, too
Promise
You just worried
about Danny, huh ?
Ya I'm just first married
and... Baby, it's hard
to handle, You know
for kid...
Danny ! Dan, Don't !
Sweetie, I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I did not mean it for you
to find out this...
Leave me alone, Mom !
Danny?
Danny, can you at least
try to be happy
for everybody?
No !
Danny, please don't !
Please don't let him
ruin this
This is the happiest day
of my life
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
Just give me two minutes
I'll be right down
Diane, it's me, is my
dad there?
I have to talk to him
No, honey,
he's not home yet
When is he coming
home?
Soon, I guess, Danny,
are you okay?
Tell him he's got to
come and get me,
I have to talk to him
Who are you talking to?
Take me to my Dad's
house. I want to go now
No, this is between us
You and I are going to
sit down here and we're
going to talk this
through, okay?
I know that you're upset,
sweetheart,
but you have to believe
me when I tell you
that a baby
is not going
to change the way
I feel about you
I know, Mom, I'm
number one, remember ?
Check out of your room
Meet me out front at seven
Did you get it all ?
Yeah, Ray
I've got it all
All right,
I'll be waiting
About time
What did I miss?
Excuse me guys
I got to go into town
for a little while,
but it shouldn't take long
Okay, will you wait?
I'll walk you to your
car, okay?
We're not through
I'll be right back
How do you think the
conversation's going ?
You don't understand
I feel like I've betrayed
him, or something
Stop it, will you? You
haven't betrayed anybody
He's just upset
He'll get over it
Listen, I'll wrap this
thing up as soon as
I can and I'll be home
I love you
Please drive carefully
It looks like there's
a storm coming in
It's been a pleasure
having you
Mr. Coleman
Come back anytime
See you around
Take care
Put it in the back
Good - bye and good
riddance
So where you off to?
Miami Beach
Starting tomorrow
I'm going to be working on
my tan and a case of Cuervo
If you ever get fed up
here in Frontier land
come on down
Miami's got no appeal
for me
None whatsoever
I'm going to have a kid
Get the hell out of here
Isn't that great?
You're really going all
the way with this
" Leave it to Beaver " thing
Two kids?
Danny's not mine
That's got to be tough,
putting up with some
other guy's brat
I couldn't do it
I put up with the damn
kid because I got no choice
you know
I got to make a stop here
Why?
You don't think I had
that kind of cash on me
did you?
No, I got it stashed up
here at a brickworks I own
Comes in handy for
stuff, Jesus !
What?
No, it's just that I've never
been out here before at night
And I can't see a goddamn
thing cause it's pouring
Are you kidding me?
No, I'm not kidding you
You see anything in this shit?
Jesus ! What are you,
lost?
Relax, it's around here
somewhere. Let me just
look at the map,
all right?
The map's in here
I got a flight to catch !
Stop bitching at me !
look in the back for the map
Jesus Christ
I don't see no
goddamn map
It's in here somewhere
You see it?
This is unbelievable !
Wait till you see what
you got back here
What's going on ?
It's Danny, Rick
He ran away
Are you okay?
I'm fine
It's okay, Mr. Barnes
Your wife got a call
from Mr. Morrison
Danny showed up over
there
Thank God, you want to
go get him?
Hold on, Mr. Barnes
There's more
What is it?
He told his father he
saw you kill a man
He told his father what?
He claims he was hiding
in the back of your Suburban
He says that's where he
saw you do it
Susan, what would make
Danny say something like this?
It's obvious,
Rick, it's Danny's way of getting
back at us for the baby
We should head down to
the station
And we'll be needing the
keys to your Suburban
I know what I saw, I'm
not making this up
He killed a guy
Danny, are you sure
you're not doing this
because you're
mad at Rick?
Diane, please
Danny, let's go over this
again, all right?
Take your time, start
from the beginning
Don't leave anything out
Send them in
It's your mother and
stepfather
They're going to join us
No Dad, please no
I don't want to see him, Dad
Danny
A already told you, he
never said his name
Dad ?
Just answer the question
It's okay
And you say that
you heard
your stepfather and
this man
talking about money
They were supposed to be
going to get some money
Only, Rick killed him
instead
Danny, stop this, please
He said that he loved
the baby and that he hated me
Sweetheart, listen, I
know that we've hurt you,
But what you're doing
isn't fair, it's not right
I'm telling the truth
No, Danny, you're doing
what you do when a situation
comes along
that you can't handle
Look, he knows the truth,
he knows what he did
and you're just going to
sit there and let him get
away with it, Dad
Come in
Johnson just called in
from the brickworks
Excuse me
So, no charbroiled
skeletons?
If a body was incinerated
in a kiln like they got over there,
it would take a forensic
specialist-
I am not wasting
any more time or money
on this sick kid's
bullshit story
David, phone call,
line seven
Hold on
Stevens
It's the garage
Okay, go on
There was
No visible evidence at
all at the brickworks
or, for that matter,
in your truck
Keys are at the front desk
You all should go home
Danny, let's go home
I'm not going home
with him
Danny, we are going to
go home and talk about this
okay?
Dad, please don't make
me go home
Susan, let him come
home with me
No, Frank, every time he
has a problem,
he comes
running to you
I want him to come
home now
Dad, don't make me go
Jesus, Danny,
knock it off !
Dad ? You don't believe
me, either ?
You're asleep right now
This is a dream
You're dreaming that
someone's got their
hand over your mouth and
it's hard to breathe
and you can't wake up,
can you?
can you?
Now, you had a dream
about a murder
And it felt like it was
real
It's only a nightmare
You don't want every
moment of your life to
be a big screaming nightmare
do you, Danny?
Better wake up
He wants me to pick them up?
Have the port lights come in
I'm expecting them this
afternoon
All right, call and
make sure
Hey, how you doing ?
Good morning
How are you, Frank?
Rick
You got a hell of a
place here
Frank, I just want to let
you know I'm not taking
what happened last
night personally
I just look forward to
getting past it
But on to something more
positive here, I do have
the start- up money for
the Seacliff, $50,000
When do you think you
could start building the boats?
You know, when I went
home last night,
I couldn't
even think about sleeping
But here's what I did
think about
My son is living with you
in your house
And I have absolutely no
idea of what kind
of man you really are
and, honestly, that scares
the hell out of me
Well, Frank, you're a good
dad, you know
But before you start
letting your imagination
Run away with you here,
I'd ask you to remember
something
It's true that you may not
know me so well, but
you do know Danny
and he lies, I know that
He lies to his mother
his grandmother
His teachers, the police
Just about everybody, but
But what?
He doesn't lie to me
Hard as I tried, I couldn't
think of a sing le time
I didn't kill anybody,
Frank
probably not, Rick
I'm glad to hear you
say that
As long as my son is
living with you under your roof,
" probably" isn't good
enough
Jesus Christ, Frank, who's
this guy, Ray?
What about him?
He's your
school chum
he's your business
acquaintance
The other day I saw him,
he was looking for real estate
Ray
Yeah
So now it's Ray
I supposedly killed,
is that right?
I tell you, Frank, trying
to be a stepfather
To a child that hates
your guts,
isn't exactly a picnic
I thought you were on
my side for this
I'm on Danny's side
Give my best to Diane
then, Frank
Right
I just think it's a good
idea if he stays with
that's all
I'm not having this
conversation with you
I know that Rick
threatens you-
He threatens me,
all right
You're so wrong
about him
You don't even know
what he's really about
You're the one that
I don't really know
anything about anymore,
Frank
Do you think that I so
desperately need a man,
that I'm going to endanger
my own child by marring a-
Danny
What are you
doing here?
Come on,
Danny, let's go
No, he's coming home
with me
He's scared of the guy
It's not right
What do you get?
Have I ever stopped you
from seeing him?
This is not about custody
Danny, please get
in my car
If you want to fight me
for custody-
I don't want to fight you
for custody !
Please don't do this !
Hold on a second, Frank
This is none of your
business
What if I make it my
business?
Don't !
Frank, don't do this !
I'm sorry, Mike
Dad, that was so cool
Put your seat belt on
That was awesome
Knock it off, Danny
You know what I've
just done?
It's called kidnapping
How could it be
kidnapping ?
I'm your kid
It just is
It doesn't matter
So you believe me now?
Yeah, yeah
What are we going to
do now? I don't know
Dad, watch out !
You never struck me
as the kind of guy
Who would exploit the
emotional problems of
his son to make a play
for custody
Sergeant, I know you have
a history with my son
I know that's why you're
having a hard time with this
But this character,
Ray Coleman
he was at the weeding -
When Ray Coleman
showed up at the wedding,
Rick Barnes
wasn't happy to see him
But there's more
they had two different
stories about how they met
Maybe Ray Coleman is
a little confused
But he wasn't confused
Maybe he'd been
drinking, come on now
You can go now
Mr. Morrison
Your ex-wife isn't
pressing charges
And, for the time being,
neither are we
By the way, I checked
with the police in the
Bay Area
No Ray Coleman was
reported missing
That's not good enough
Good-bye, Mr. Morrison
Jack, look, it was not
my intention to
fight for custody
But now I have
no choice, do I ?
Right !
Okay, all right, I'll see
you there at 10. Thanks
That was Berman
He's tough, man
But he's good, he's the
one who handled the
whole divorce thing
Just have to figure out
What?
I'm sorry, Frank
I can't believe that you
have actually managed to
convince yourself that
this man -This man ?
This man who only
wanted to help-This man ?
Do you want me to
ignore the fact that my son is
living with a killer ?
is that what you want?
This fantasy of yours,
it sure does give you a
good excuse, doesn't it?
For what? Excuse for what?
An excuse to hold on to
your old life
I know Danny's your son,
And I would never ask
you to choose between us
But I won't hang around
while you take Susan on
in some insane
custody battle
Diane, I have never
failed Danny, ever
And I can't fail him now
not when it counts
I'm sorry
I'm sorry too, Frank
But I can't do this
Rick, sweetheart will you
please hurry up?
I don't
want to be late for this
Calm down will you?
Moms always win these
things, right?
No, it's never a sure
thing, Rick
You all right?
I still can't believe
this is happening
You know, Susan
ever since Frank hit us
with this custody thing,
there's something I'd like
to talk to you about
About what?
Well, I feel like I've done
Everything I can but
stand on my head with
Danny's concern
And he won't give me a
break. There's no way-
I know and I'm sorry
sweet pea
There's nothing for you
to be sorry about
It's been hard on
everybody
But maybe if Danny went
off to live with Frank
for a little while
That wouldn't be the
worse thing in the world
for everybody
What?
I'm just trying to think
about what would be
best for everyone, dear
Rick
Susan
things get really tense
when Danny's around
and the doctor said if
you get stressed out,
you could lose the baby
I don't give a damn
what the doctor said,
Danny's my son
It's bad enough he hardly
talks to me anymore
If he goes to live with Frank
I'd be lucky if I ever
see him again
Rick,
we talked about this
I'm sorry
Danny's not going to go
anywhere,
I promise
you that, okay?
Dan, listen up
Whatever the judge
decides today
I want you to know that
your mother loves you
remember that
I'll see you there
All right
Love you
Love you, too
I'm ready to go
Mom?
She's bringing the car
around,
Danny She can't hear you
I'm not afraid of you
I don't give a damn if
you're afraid of me or not
What I want to know is,
do I need to be afraid of you
Danny?
What do you mean ?
This custody hearing
thing that you have
us all going to today
if we come home
without you
Dan
that's going to upset
your mom
and like I said to you
I can't allow that to happen
Now, I know that you
love your dad very much
How would you feel if
something happened to him?
Look, I'll do whatever
you want
Just, please,
leave them alone
I want both parties
to know
That a child of
Danny's age
is old enough to have a
voice in determining
which parent he would be
better off living with
Now, that being said
call your witness
Mr. Berman
Thank you
Your honour, we'd like to call
Danny Morrison to the stand
Hello, Danny
Danny Morrison ?
Yes, sir
How old are you?
I'm 12, sir
Twelve, so we can't
swear you in
But it is your word of
honour when you sit in
that witness box
do you understand that?
Yes, sir
Good,
then let's get to work
Counsellor
Thank you, Your honour
Hello, Danny
I'm going to ask you a
few questions
you all right with that?
All right, let's go back
to the evening of October 18th
That was the night your
mother cane home from the
doctor with some news
just tell what
happened
I found out that my mom
was going to have a baby
Yeah ? How did you
handle that?
I guess I kind of freaked
Go on
After that, I wanted to
go and see my dad
How come?
Cause I felt like I needed
to talk things over with him
You and your dad are
pretty close then ?
Yes, sir
All right, Danny, just
take your time and tell us
what happened next
Well, I hid in the back
of Rick's truck
cause he was going
into town,
and that's near where
my dad lives
And then
And then he stopped at
this office building and
I jumped out
What?
I ran to my dad's house,
And I made up this story
about seeing him kill some guy
Danny, what are you
doing ? Tell them the truth
This is the truth, Dad
Did he threaten you?
You keep this up
Mr. Morrison,
I will have you removed
from this courtroom
This is not how
Frank sit down
Let me ask you
something, Danny
Do you want to give it
another try with your
mom and Rick
Or do you think you'd
be better off living
with your dad ?
I'd like to stay with my
mom and Rick
Look
Frank
I know what
happened today
I'm glad somebody
does. Drink?
I'm not going to
drink with you
Frank
Too bad
You ought to go home
Okay
Frank
Danny lied
Again
But at least he's not
living under the same
roof with a killer
I'll drink to that
No, this is how you
lost Danny the first time
Come on
Frank let's go home
That's the best offer
I've had in a while
You get fresh
Frank
I'll make it real
It's my day to see him
Susan
Yeah, I know it is
What?
I tried talking to him
but he just
went racing out
I'm sure he just feels
badly about lying to you
I'm sure it'll be okay
I'm sorry
I have to go,
But I promise I'll tell
him to call you
Cheeseburger and
french fries
Can I get you anything
to drink?
Diet Coke
Sounds good
Took me 15 years to get
one of these. How long
you been here?
Been here about two years
but I being here
for a long time
Two years
At the rate you're going,
we'll be naming the town
after you
Thank you very much, I
appreciate it. Thank you
I'd just like to say
thank you to the men and
women of Southport
For recognizing me with
this honour, I feel flattered
to be included
Hey, Dan
Hey, Dad
You're a hard man to
get a hold of lately
What are you doing here?
What is this about,
Frank?
I'm just trying to talk
to my son
Ten o'clock at night?
It's not your business
Frank, do you really
think
That showing up here
drunk in front of your son
What is that supposed
to make him want to spend
more time around you?
Are you crazy
Frank?
What are you doing ?
Screw you, Patterson !
Just because this
asshole's got some money
to spread around you don't
give a shit who he is !
Dad why don't you
just go home?
Dad you dropped
your wallet
Dad wait up
Sorry Danny I shouldn't
have come here
You dropped your wallet
That's not my wallet, Dan
Dad, you have to stop
making trouble for him
So, Dad, please
just lay off, okay?
How are you?
What do you want?
Nothing much
Just five bucks
You wouldn't happen to
have $5 you could lend
your old step dad
would you, Dan ?
No
You don't?
Maybe we should
check your wallet
Where's your wallet,
Danny?
I don't know
You don't know?
Don't you think you
should probably
start looking for it?
I really hope you didn't
lose that, Dan
Start looking for it
I didn't tell him
anything, Rick
Maybe you think I've
just been fooling around
with you
is that it, Danny?
All I did was say I was
sorry for not being home-
Bullshit !
I swear to God,
that's all I said
You're a little fucking
liar, aren't you, Danny?
I'm telling the truth, Rick
I hope so
Does Ray Coleman
sound familiar to you?
Ray Coleman ? That name
doesn't sound familiar
Would you check your
register ?
Because my sister's
really worried about him
Here we go, Ray Coleman
Checked in on
September the 8th
and checked out on -
check the 18th
Yeah, October 18th
How about a telephone
number, address?
I could check his bill
Yeah, yeah
Here we go, C, Coleman
These are just the
local calls
What's this?
Pizza Hut
How about this?
He called this a lot
Yeah, he liked the ladies
You patty?
Who are you?
A friend of Ray's
Ray?
Coleman
That shit owes me money
Join the club
Can I talk to you?
I didn't know Ray that
well, we were just
killing time
You know how it is
Yeah, I can't believe
this guy
He never even told you
where he was from?
No
What did you guys
talk about?
We didn't do that
much talking
We weren't doing that
We were watching TV
I don't know what Ray
likes better
to screw or
watch basketball
At least he gave me this
I know that lighter
Let me see
Oh, yeah
It was my birthday a
couple of weeks ago
I like this lighter
It's not even real
Yeah, but I like the
horseshoe thing
Buy it from you
How much ?
I don't know, it's a
pretty nice lighter
$25
Cool
If you can just have this
dusted for prints
I'm sure we'll find that
this Ray Coleman's
got a record
And if he does
then we know that Rick Barnes
will have one, too
A lot of people have
handled this lighter
The lab could
only manage
to lift off one
clean set of prints
It turns out they belong
to a convicted felon
Her name is Patty Walsh
Prostitution, Drug use
Hey, Frank
I'm glad I ran into you
About last night, we
both got a little bit hot
under the collar
And I felt terrible
about it
Recognize that?
Probably fell out of Ray's
pocket when you pulled
him from the truck
What are you doing,
Frank?
You touch
so much as one hair
on my son's head
and I swear, as God is
my witness
that'll be the last thing
you ever do in this world
You're the second guy today
who's been in here
looking for Ray Coleman
You again ?
What do you want?
What basketball team
did he root for ?
What are you talking
about?
You said that he liked
to screw and watch
basketball, what team
did he root for ?
Chicago
Ray Coleman -Three
Convictions in
Racketeering Case
Oh, God
Is Detective Stevens
there?
No, this is
Frank Morrison
When will he be back?
You have an e-mail
address there?
Thank you
No, wait, listen
When he gets in, have
him check his e-mail
And have him call Frank
Morrison at the boathouse
as soon as he gets it
Thank you
As you can see, this
venerable building
a long time fixture in the
Southport community
Continues to bum
It just keeps ringing,
Mom
It's okay, sweetheart
You know how careful Dad is
I'm sure he's fine
He's fine
No, Mom, Rick said
he'd do this !
He said he'd hurt Dad !
He killed the guy,
just like I said,
and he threatened to
kill Dad, too !
Forget it, Mom, you won't
believe me, anyway
Danny, what are you
talking about?
Danny, we're getting
out of here
Mom?
Now
Sweetheart, I didn't
hear you come in
Just got back
Danny, you go wait
in the car
Where are you going ?
There was a fire at
Frank's place and the
boathouse burned down
What?
Danny wants to go and
make sure
that Frank is okay
You want
me to take you?
It's okay
Danny's really upset and
I think it's best if I
take him alone, okay?
Stevens
What is this?
Frank Morrison sent
it over
Rick Barnes, indicted for
extortion bribery
attempted murder
His real name is
Jack Pamell
Your reckon the
Chicago Chamber of
Commerce gave
him an award, too?
Hello?
Frank Morrison
Susan, it's Frank
Now, listen
You and Danny get
out of the house now !
I know I'm in the car
with Danny-
I think I better drive
Danny
I'm fine, Rick
Get out of the car, Susan
Mom?
It's okay, sweetheart
I just need to hang on to
him till I'm someplace safe
Please don't do this
Please
Mom, are you all right?
Give me the keys
Take me instead, please
You were the best thing
that ever happened to me
Run, Danny, run !
You bitch !
Danny, go lock the doors
and the living room !
Did you lock everything ?
Yeah,
did you call the police?
Go ! Run !
Leave him alone !
Mom, get up
Mom, wake up
Mom, please get up
Get up
You're going to sit still,
aren't you?
You sure you're
going to be okay?
I'll be fine, Mom
We'll follow you
to the hospital
Frank, I'm sorry
No, it's okay
I'm sorry about the baby
Mom, I love you
I love you too,
sweetheart
Mr. Morrison, hold on
There's really not a
whole lot
I can say right
now, except
Just say it to him
Danny, I'm sorry
It's all right
