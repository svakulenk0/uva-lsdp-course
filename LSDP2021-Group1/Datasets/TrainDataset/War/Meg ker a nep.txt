- Tell them
- With your orders
Yes... the bailiff wants to speak to you.
Only together.
- Together.
- Together.
Friends, sing together
The sad song and crowned work
Only the rich peolple have a fatherland
The Valley and the field, belong to them
Right to the people!
Right to the people!
I had to talk to you
Camarades!
I followed of near the mouvments which had
Agitated Hungary
Here like everywhere, the capital
Monopolize all the national production
It creates new industries
But it asservire agriculture
And ruined the traditional
independant exploitation
Would you allow me to go nearer to you?
I want to hear what you are reading.
The agricultural population is divided
Into the group of large landowners,
capitalist underfarmers
and the masses of landless proletarians.
We have to go through this
capitalistic revolutiononce.
It means indescribable suffering
for the majority of the people,
But it alone creates
The conditions which ensure
a new social system
It creates men and women
Who will have the strength
and wish
For the materialization of a new,
better social order.
Sincerely yours: Friedrich Engels.
Did you understand anything from this?
I did.
I understand, but did you
understand anything?
Let me see!
I want to dispute it with you.
We are workers, We have no freedom
Because instead of luck
we were hit by misfortune
Never mind! Never mind!
Long live the worker
Long live the rights
Long live the workers' society
We shall break the horn
Of that great lord
He shall not give orders
For the poor workers
Never mind!
Long live the worker
Long live the rights
Long live the workers' society
If we cannot live happily
We shall have to wander away
Never mind!
Long live the worker
Long live the rights
Long live the workers' society
You know better than me,
that one does not only live on prayers
Here is the food, we can agree
Our patience is running out we consider
your movement as a crime against the nation
Against the bread
Still, authorized by the Underfarmers' Society,
I repeat my offer
We pay what was always
customary in our country
Which you know better than me
Thirty-two bushels of wheat
Thirty-two florins of cash
Thirty-two livres of salts
Permission to keep one cow
One acre of corn field
Hemp field
Two pigs with their yearly
offsprings.
If not, not!
You cannot blame me for not
trying to help you
For not trying to speak to
you.
Leave us, we are sworn men
Drop the guns!
Cowards, dogs, brigands! Gendarmes!
We gave you bread!
- Go away!
- I told you, drop it!
Come here, mister bailiff!
Hey, hey, men!
Stop!
Help!
Shout/
Load! Fire!
Is there an independent man
among you?
Is there one who does not
serve someone else?
- Who is a master of his own destiny?
- There is none.
Fire! Fire! Fire!
Most of men are not independant.
The masses are born in misery and
oppression and die in the same privation.
We are ignorants as our parents were
They do not die from their own,
but from someone else's illness.
For we inherited our parents'
ignorance, and hand it over to our children.
For we are wearing the yoke of the few!
For we endure the oppression!
We, socialists swear to God
That we shall serve faithfully
all our life
We shall not want even the
slightest penny of our comrades
That we shall respect our comrades
as our brothers and if necessary,
shall die for them!
So help me God!
This is the plan of the brigand
This is the plan of the brigand
To strangle us and ruin
Cannon answered, boom-boom,
cannons said Come here, come here,
Cannon answered, boom-boom,
cannons said Come here, come here,
Let's dance and celebrate the
cannon of the liberator.
The cock of my godmother
Flew onto the fence, the fence
It crows, it crows
My godmother is a whore, is a whore
Godmother do as you like, as you like
I am the cock, you the hen, you the hen
Cadet!
Cadet! Your revolver!
The cat has four legs,
The fifth is its tail,
Off we go to Moldavia,
In the land of Moldavia,
The cat has four legs,
The fifth is its tail,
Friends, sing together.
The sad song and crowned work
Only the rich peolple have a fatherland
The Valley and the field, belong to them
We built their palate
Who dominate us so proudly
Who dominate us so proudly?
But, what are there for us
In theses campaigns?
Nothing is with us,
Not a piece
Only our tomb
All at the end,
When we leave this bagne
Take care with the hungry people!
All will become insurrectionnists!
They will rise!
They will kill!
Tomorrow, we will bu free!
The wild anger of the tempest struck us
Every damnation of vicious hell upon us
The day for our final attack is nearing
Who knows what the future brings
We look forward with proud hearts,
We carry the red flag of the workers,
With too many lords, there's no freedom
With too many rich, there's even more poor,
With too many pomp, men don't work,
With too much past, the present is poor,
With so much ignorance, there are many tyrants.
Where there are many pharisees,
their humanism is rare
We look forward, with proud hearts,
We carry the red flag of the workers,
With us the suffering slaves of the earth,
Will gain a freer and better homeland!
We look forward, with proud hearts,
We carry the red flag of the workers,
With us the suffering slaves of the earth,
Will gain a freer and better homeland!
I was sent to kill you.
The bride is a pretty flower,
Her garland is of bluebells,
He is the happy bridegroom,
Who can say, she is mine.
The bride is a garland of pearls,
Only my heart is sad,
The heart of the bride, and
All her heart beats are mine.
The top of the tree is in bloom,
Garland is on the head of the girl,
The flowers have to fall,
The girl has to marry,
Come my honey, come,
For my heart awaits you,
Longing for you, longing for you.
If you kiss me I'll be happy,
Pretty girl is you see,
The wind plays with her nice hair,
Still until the following day
It's unaware off all the chagrin
But the flower will fade
The girl must mary
She will know sorrow
Its happiness will end
The charrette arrived
And soon will teke it along
But says the engaged girl
I will never marry.
A beautiful flower is married
Its crown is of lily of the valley
Happy is his engaged
For which it is intended
The girl is a pearl
My heart is heavy because i love him
The heart of the pretty engaged
Is mine, entire
Good morning, Adam Balog
In a velvet cap
Good morning, pretty Barbara
Skilled in dancing
- Do you recognize me, men?
- Yes, my lord
I want to talk to you, men
Will you listen to me? Men!
You know me very well
You know i didn't come to open up the wounds,
but to heal them
You are clever men, workers from the Plain.
You know the situation better here than i do
But in many respects you don't know
You have probably heard the word economy.
But, do you no the most important
basic principales
Of economic is that the relationship
between offer and demand
Who determines the value of not only the goods
but also of human labour,
But you repute this
However, if the price of wheat increases,
we need some workers
If the price decrease
field workers are in unemployment
You can't solve this even if you
own the land
This is the iron law
It is so today
And it will be so tomorrow
What can we do?
We have to think in a sober manner.
We need some small farmers
Cheap rental, cultivation,
consumer co-operative
funds for the disabled, labour exchange
without politics, handicraft
And first and foremost thriftiness
That the Hungarian field workers should
acquire moral capitaland later land.
Let me have it!
The leaders of the present social system
System will never voluntarily improve
the miserable situation of the working class.
The miserable situation of the working class.
One has to organize everywhere,
So that the power
of the organized workers
can be placed against
the present autocratic system
Against the actual power
Then we can create new laws
Which will protect the interests
of the workers
And ensure the welfare of the people
I don't want to offend
but if you can't even read?
Don't you think that first
the people have to be raised,
and rights should be given later?
I'm sorry.
He's Dead!
Assassins! Brigands!
You killed him.
You killed him!
Get out of here!
Only the ignorant fears
and the uneducated frets
The sage learns the nature expects
to be studied, to be approached
It slowly opens up its secrets
you learn its laws,
, and the dominating great
This was not appreciated by those
Who hindered cognition and knowledge
Those who said you are a heretic
and burnt you by the thousands
In the name of superstition
Lying that this is the way to salvation.
Although they are only worried for their
thousand year old power over you.
Nowadays
They are still obstructing
knowledge and cognition
Because this is their greatest enemy.
Learn man and the acquaintance
with nature will teach you
how to rid yourself of your tyrants.
Here is the bread: For it they sin and rebel
But in the evening, fear will descend upon them
And at dawn they will not exist,
And will be trembling in
front of our angry Lord
Rights for the people!
Don't approach Balint!
Are you with the priest?
You're not our brother anymore,
and you are not your own master.
I tell you comrades
Don't offend anybody,
Until you've heard what
everyone has to say
A socialist man is open to every thought
And is willing to dispute.
I don't listen to you, priest,
I don't dispute with a priest
Neither do I... neither do i.
Pastoral letter of His Eminence, Louis,
the Bishop of Csanad, to his misguided flock
If the people move
As if the dissatisfied part
of the earth throbbed
It leaves the ungrateful rocks
and becomeshomeless in its soul
The ideas of God, country, king and freedom
die out of his bosom
My people,
there are those who rob the people.
Here are heretics, pagans, Jews,
and other denominatio
But you, my flock,
did not turn against the guilty,
but against the whole of society
The hungry man
the desperate man
Sees an enemy in everybody who does not starve
and whose members are clad in decent clothes
Come on, stab and cut,
lead the attack of the peasants!
Come on, stab and cut,
lead the attack of the peasants!
Save us Lord from orphancy!
Save us Lord!
Save us Lord from widowhood!
Save us Lord from emigration!
From eating the sugar beet
Save us our Lord!
From cabbage without meat
Save us our Lord!
From starvation
Save us our Lord!
From the holes in the boots
Save us our Lord!
Of perforated boots
Save us our Lord!
From carrying it on our back
Save us our Lord!
From slavery
Save us our Lord!
Have you got a weapon, old man?
Rights for the people.
Homeland for the workers!
Do you remember what you taught us?
Man, never touch a weapon,
a killing, man destroying tool!
Because we want to make reality
of the prophecy of Isaiah when he said that
They shall beat their swords into plowshares
And the lion shall eat straw like the ox
And there will be no violence between the people
But take this axe now, for us,
For our poverty.
My hand trembles
respected comrades
Not because I fear you
but because tears fell too many times
from my eyes and now again.
I turn to you with begging words.
Don't forget what you are pushing us
into because of the immaturity of the people
A sober socialist doesn't destroy
Whatever offense we suffered
We should not create confusion
Workers, let us organize the peaceful party
and don't rebel
Let us ask for a protective law
from those who can supply it,
but don't create scandal.
The socialist people
means the conscious workers
let us not dirty the name.
Forward friends
, under the flag of dear Jesus
The help of the brave,
Ends in victory
Trust,
For Jesus will come
and He is the commander.
Women
say the blessing, the way you used to.
These have come from the great misery
And washed their clothes,
And bleached their clothes
, in the blood of the Lamb
Therefore,
they stand in front of the royal seat of the Lord
And serve Him day and night in his temple
And who sits in the royal seat
Extends his tent over their heads
They do not starve
They do not thirst
The Sun does not scorch them
and nothing else
Because the Lamb,
who sits in the middle of the royal seat,
Lets them graze
And the living well of the water carries them
And God wipes all the tears from their eyes.
Our Father, in the body of the chairman
Hallowed be thy person, through
the respect and devotion towards the people
Socialism, thy kingdom come
Here and all over the world!
Through the respect and devotion
towards the people
The taxes should be less,
Bread should be more and life easier
People,
free yourself from the common
oppressor of human rights
For they deserve their punishment
which they drew on themselves
For oppressing rights and equality
Money, let us not into temptation
, for through you, many sell their principles
And join the oppressors of
the people as slaves.
The world of science should enlighten our brains
To accomplish this holy cause!
Amen!
I supplement this Lord's prayer!
Listen! Mates!
The time has come, our time!
Who do not work shall not eat,
from the bread wetted with our sweat.
The land belongs to nobody
but the fruit to everybody
The fruit of the earth belongs to everybody.
The fruit of the earth belongs to everybody.
If anything happens to us,
if we went forever
If you never saw us
Remember: The land belongs
to those who cultivate it
Tell those who hide as cowards
behind the back of the infants
That we despise them, They are not Hungarians,
For the Hungarians are chivalrous,
honest, frank and patriotic.
Tell them that I, Aladar Petko-Szautner
sends them the message,
I will not fight against them,
They can go wherever they like,
but they should remember
That Hungarian society will only be gallant
with gallant Hungarian workers
They have ten minutes to retreat!
They don't call me - Gendarme,
I won't do anything wrong
I won't be a jailer of anybody,
I won't help to skin the people
I wasn't brought up to be a soldier
To serve a miserable government,
I won't be the mercenary of anybody
But the true and faithful fighter for the idea.
Janos Fekete Nagy
Are you approaching us?
I am approaching.
Godparents, are you holding him tightly
We are holding him tightly
Bring him nearer
We brought him nearer.
Janos Fekete Nagy, did you come voluntarily?
Voluntarily.
What were you before?
The oppressor of the people,
a servant of the lords.
What do you want to be?
A faithful colleague.
Repent and confess.
I confess that out of cowardice,
meanness and led
By the promises of a tempting future
, I blindly followed the orders
of the people's oppressors
I even engaged in evil affairs
I abandoned my honest work
for a lighter life
, I disowned my own mother
and the working people
People from which i sprang.
Do you feel repentance and sorrow?
Deep repentance and
Sincere regret.
Godparents,
Are you ready to accept the burden of this man
In front of whole workers' society?
We are ready.
Because instead of luck,
We were hit by misfortune,
never mind! Never mind!
Long live the worker,
long live the rights
, long live the workers' society.
We are workers
we have no freedom,
Because instead of luck,
we were hit by misfortune
, never mind! Never mind!
Long live the worker,
long live the rights
, long live the workers' society
Put me down, comrades
How could I patronize anybody
When I myself am a feeble human
And so are my friends?
How could you take you under my protection?
Me and my friends are well weak
I can only say that the reason
for the misery and tribulations of the people
Is the lack of land
of which it has been deprived
The humanity common goods
The happiness of the people will be restored
by recovering the land
The people do not need patronization
but independent action.
Don't believe, comrades, that i and my friends
can accomplish the worldwide work
And equality of wealth
That will be accomplished
by the enlightened people.
...with the butt of the rifle,
And with the hand,
and with bayonet,
And all along, oh, and not for the potatoes
or for the beans
But always hey, hey, hey...
Death has three rules?
First comes a red cart
And under the grass
Hey... There is stupidity
and blind belief,
Janos Szanto is dead
Janos Baksa is dead
And always all along
Until the end,
until the final end,
really, really
And there, then, hey...
The stone will be hard
And the butter soft,
And there is nothing else,
Anly, and there is nothing else
nothing at all.
I swear by the living God
That I regret my socialist oath
And declare it null and void
I swear that i will never participate
In any movement against the
valid laws and legal order
And will keep clear.
If anybody tries to violate
this oath i will report it to the court
I will report it to the court
So help me God
Comrades! I do not fear such an oath,
because it has no power over me,
because it has no power over me
But regard me closely
when i stand in front of you
Watch my eyes, there is only one truth in them,
which I confirm in front of you, however,
I beg you,
Give me strength through your mercy
to be able to disown my comrades and my belief.
Even if you don't answer
look upon me as your good comrade
Who you will always remember.
Mates!
I can return to work, perhaps the wife
and children will survive...
Comrades!
You taught me many good things
But I must say I cannot conceive
the demands of the idea
The chaos, and I quote the Bible:
We run towards destruction
Destruction will ruin the Earth
The Earth will break and shake
Like those who are drunk
and will slide like a shack
His crime will press him
He will fall and never rise
Time born for sorrow, Fog producing wind,
Time born for sorrow, Fog producing wind,
I have been consumed
By this past year
By this past year
Cette trop longue année
Hey, if I...
...knew which road to take
...knew which road to take
I would plough it.
All along,
Until the end
Until the end
Of the end
Really for good.
And then there
Hey, the stone will be hard
And the butter soft
And there is nothing else only those.
If an old man goes into the vineyard
Ad finds a nut,
Hepicks it up
and plants it somewhere
He is well aware that
he will not enjoy its fruit
Oly the future generation
I feel like that too.
I know we shall not accomplish
what we are fighting for
But we want to plant
A tree which will bear fruit
for the future.
Comrades!! We are empty-handed
against the hangmen of the power
We cannot take revenge
for the blood curdling acts
Don't let us be halted
By the terror and its mercenaries!
I know Joska, you have an order
And if you are given an order
you will even kill your father.
We are workers
we have no freedom
Because instead of luck,
we were hit by misfortune
Never mind! Never mind!
Long live the worker,
long live the rights
long live the workers' society!
