Nothing useful, except that map.
Grieg was right. They destroyed the radio.
The captain met. - Really?
We start here, and the decline started from here.
We went in this direction for an hour and a quarter, maybe half.
I think we're through here.
Fuck! - In approx.
Captain!
What it is this - going to help you walk, sir.
My hardware is limited.
And mine own.
It not meant for the present.
I know what it means.
At best, we will walk 50 km.
And at worst? - Much more.
You can not walk much.
It seems you can. - Because not even the action of the drug was approved.
You better start.
First ladies.
First Captain.
Nancy.
This name is very common in the Netherlands.
You is not Dutch, right?
Do not.
I know I have no right to ask your ...
I have an itch behind her ear, and I can not xytho.
I wonder if ...
Never mind, forget it. I do not want to feel uncomfortable.
In this ear? - Yes.
Thank you. Bran.
What are you doing?
Nothing. Dietrich had an itch.
They did not say.
His name is "Nazis".
Tell all down!
If you speak, you die!
No, damn it!
Let it down! Let your gun!
Let it down!
No, do not leave me! - He went down!
Shut up you!
Let it down! You're surrounded!
He left immediately ... Shut up!
Let it down! You're surrounded!
He left immediately ... Shut up!
Shoot your weapon!
Where is the rest?
He would not be alone, right?
Only it was.
You say that you were a coward?
Today more as I look.
I'm fine. I'm fine, Lieutenant.
Did I do something wrong?
Do not.
What you looking at?
Who you are?
Hello! Do you speak English?
You are Americans? - Yes.
Please!
Need your help. - I can not help you.
Our captain, painful injury.
Do not worry.
We can not fail.
Tell your friends, to leave their weapons outside.
The place seems very quiet.
I grew up on a farm.
I did not know that you are in the province.
Yes ...
My family wakes up when the rooster crowed.
Straw, who reminded me of my home.
You miss your parents?
I miss my mother.
And your father?
He ...
She left when I was 8 years old.
Again you've seen since then?
I do not want to see.
Not worth doing that to my mother and my sister.
How many are you
Six people. - All Americans?
Same as you?
Yes.
Please phone or mobile? - Phone only find in the city.
Can you go there? We need medicines.
There are many Germans there. It is very hard going.
And you have to leave. - We have no food and water.
There is a hotel here.
We are aware of the dangers.
Really?
Who else lives here? - Anyone.
What is Lady?
My wife.
Where is?
He has died.
Maxwell, can leave us a little peace?
I am very sorry about your husband.
What do you think?
If alive, he would not help us?
I'm not talking about my wife, now.
And I lost my husband.
He died in hospital in Africa.
So I became a nurse.
Whatever you do ... I hope that my husband would be proud of me.
What do you think about me now.
My wife was very attentive.
Nor will leave.
I do not believe you.
I do not believe you!
What do you say, no honors.
Have you ever wanted to go to New York.
The same also.
Well are you?
Are we going to let him sleep in the barn and give us food.
If I had to shoot him in the head.
In order to fire.
I know, sir.
I saw nothing to do.
I do not want to betray our position to the Germans, sir.
When you're in a situation, simply pull the trigger.
It was my fault, sir.
must pull the trigger ... - I'm not talking about the trigger,
another was his mistake.
He had just shot my friend, there in front of me.
This is your excuse? That had just shot his friend?
He was like my brother. - You think I do not know?
It stands in front of me and tell me?
You say bullshit, soldier.
Do not be so hard on him. It's just a child.
Take your food, and pull here.
Would I mind if I sit with you?
You lost a friend today?
I'm sorry.
I killed a German today was a child.
I shot him down.
I looked.
And I shot him.
This should make me feel good.
... That makes a better soldier.
That's why we're here, right?
To kill the bad guys.
Right.
How long have you been here? - A few weeks.
Not that as I had imagined.
Your turn is? - Yes sir.
You have not slept at all? - Very little.
Do not take it seriously, with the captain. - I do not get?
With hatred.
This war ...
In change.
We changed all of us.
Captain tries to keep alive.
In what situation it is, Lieutenant?
I've seen worse, sir.
Contaminated, she needs medicine. - I'm going or I or Lewis.
Do you know about drugs? - Would you do me a list.
I will not do it. Will I go to town to collect,
and take appropriate medications.
I go with Bruno. I will do it.
Why are you talking about?
Captain's injury. I will try to find and telephone.
We could use sugar. It helps to disinfect the wound.
You need actual medication. I have to leave immediately.
I got with you to help.
I was also in the truck. As all of you.
We went to this truck,
to save the captain's life.
Well, you can not go that way.
I see myself as a French?
Absolutely.
Are you ready?
In a minute.
Will my reservations?
If you die?
Who is?

Yes, a little.
We will do some tests. We will not be late.

It seems that our records are incomplete.
It says here that in this direction, only the main Travert life.

To get food.

We take a look.
Do not worry, ma'am.
We do this in all the houses.
We will go once we finish.
Unless ...
Hide someone.
Maybe someone Jewish.
How long have you been married?
This means that you were away from children. - Yes.
He stayed single room.
To get ahead.
Who sleeps here?
Any.
My brother, when he comes to visit us.
How do you go with your wife?
Fine.
I am very sure.
What do we have here?
For someone like very sweet.
The skin of her husband, Mrs.
Want one?
Definitely.
Please.
Have you lately seen some unknown in the region,
or anyone who has visited?
Do not.
We take a look at the other farm.
Lady. Sir Travert.
We want to see warehouse.
How did these Nazis here. Where is?
From the fourth battalion.
Nice shot.
Captain. Bruno is ready to take me to the city.
Be careful, Lieutenant. - Yes sir.
Nancy, we need more?
It's okay.
Vera.
See if you have a cold beer.
I had my priorities.
You know we can not take them with us.
We can not leave them.
I know.
Move.

Please, I'm the only child.
Lewis, shut up.
No Please! No no no.
Please!
Shut.
Do not! Do not!
Sorry, kid.
Kill him.
Louis.
Kill him. Is the end.
He never felt guilty?
What for?
To those killed.
Do not.
Instead, I would not.
I will not ask. - We do not have too many bandages.
Mr.
I'll do what I want with my body.
If you do not shoot them, they will shoot.
We had nothing in common.
I do not feel guilty.
There is no reason to feel guilty.
We have to go. - What is?
Germans.
Germans came to the farm. - Where is Vera?
I dont know. It has not been returned.
Go back and look for Vera and Bruno.
You will not make the sucker, okay?
Yes sir.
Lieutenant!
I did what you asked me.
You know what I do for liars?
Or traitors?
Please. I tried to help.
Please help us? Where are the Americans?
Where is my officer?
I dont know. - Exactly. You do not know.
Search the house!
Come on.
Lewis.
We have to go.
We heard a shot.
Where is Vera?
Currently he killed? - Do not.
This was not.
Bruno was killed. - Who is Vera?
You have to be in the city, sir.
We will be back. - You're not with them, you escaped.
He communicated with the center. We go to our last.
Lieutenant, come with us!
If you come back, you will attract the Germans and will all die.
Come on.
Lewis.
See if safe place.
See if there are any alive. - Yes sir.
We're behind enemy lines, cut our unit.
We coordinated the meeting.
What time will become the meeting? Overs.
Got there.
Red Fox 1, what will I do when I get there?
Please send me a beer, Bill. Overs.
Received. - Received, ending the conversation.
What the hell's going on there?
Germans are coming!
How ...
Close your ears, soldier.
Where is Nancy?
Take your gift, you imbecile!
Should I pass you.
But not yet.
We are here.
The Germans are here.
The point is somewhere here within a radius of 16 km.
You talk as if we can get out of here.
Good morning my friends.
Nancy.
The captain, who seemed surprised to see me.
Cigarette?
Do not.
Unfortunately, this visit is not just a social visit.
We give you a place to stay and eat,
But first, you have to do something for us.
Captain Becket, please.
No need to get tired.
Nancy.
I'm sorry for Vera.
What do you mean?
Why sad?
Dietrich Why be sad? Tell me, damn it!
They killed Vera. - Do not say it again!
We do not know who they are. - My fault.
Why do you say that?
If I had been in place.
That would be here now.
The captain was right ...
I do not know what happened there. - It is not fair that I did my job.
Otherwise my job properly.
This can happen to anyone, guy.
You understand?
No soldier should feel guilty when he kills.
How not to get sick when you look at me like that?
Take my son.
Bring it immediately!
It's okay.
It's ok, I'll do it.
I want to see him. We have to see it.
Calm down. I'll get him.
Tell ...
Who we are?
Who we are?
I'm sorry.
She cried Vera, does me good ...
Vera is not here, sir.
This man needs medication.
We are prisoners of war and we are obliged to give medical care.
I understand what I said?
Where's Dietrich?
My Commander.
Look at the people around you.
They are soldiers.
They left their home, and they came in a foreign country,
for one reason.
To defend.
Limit the Führer in Berlin ... Without anyone to do anything.
In this village, however, the struggle continues.
This people ...
These soldiers ...
Worth seeing blood.
Okay ...
What all of you fight?
What do you think?
I do not fight with skatokefalous.
And you?
Lewis soldier.
You want to fight for your country?
Wait, dammit!
Dammit!
I will fight too!
I will fight!
Get out there, Nancy! - It's enough! I will fight too!
Get out there, Nancy!
Bastard!
Mad?
Do you want revenge?
Then he fought.
Come on, Lewis.
Come on, Lewis.
Come on, Louis!
You can!
Come on, boy.
Is that.
Get up!
Stand up!
Faton Lewis.
The Orma. Faton, Lewis!
Faton!
Fight!
Beat him up!
Lewis, covering his face.
Learn clinging!
Lewis, do not get up!
Lewis, covering his face.
She left him.
See?
Finally I am very magnanimous.
If we stay here, we'll all die.
It's easy to get out of this cage.
Really? So what we do?
I dont know.
Well are you?
It hurts the jaw.
They kill us, right? - Do not.
I heard you talking. - I just prayed for mercy.
I remember my mother the day I left.
Chosen one.
You have no idea how much I cried.
I feel.
I never heard someone crying so.
He had been out of control.
I confessed enough.
I'm sorry.
Does not matter.
You will meet again with his mother, Nancy.
You have not slept at all?
Yesterday, they sent me and Maxwell on the lake, only with a guard.
I've never talked to my son, soldier?
No sir!
He was a good boy. And ferelpis.
He recruited 17.
If I could, I would have gone before.
I always wanted to be like me.
My wife said that I send directly to the grave.
Almost got it right.
It was wrong what I did.
I wonder if he knew he would die.
If I was afraid.
I'm sure it would be a good soldier, sir.
You know what makes a good soldier?
To learn how to pull the trigger.
Humanity.
Sometimes you have to pull the trigger.
But a good soldier never wants to shoot.
So confused.
What to do ...
All this will haunt me when you get home.
Mr.
Forget all Lewis.
Go home ... and enjoy your life.
Look is never sad.
Yes sir.
Lewis.
Take, for luck.
I think I need a lighter.
Yes good ...
Hold it for luck.
Are you ready?
Lieutenant!
Are you okay? Lieutenant! Dammit! Hurt. Are you okay?
Probably not. - Damn!
Get out of here, kid. - No. No, I will not leave!
It's your only chance. Out of here. Outside. I order.
Outside!
Do not.
Flown.
Come on, Nancy.
Come here.
Who was?
The Maxwell.
Lewis is a good soldier.
They can not catch.
How many?
How many you lost? 4, 5 or more multiple?
I'm fine. Is nothing.
Lewis soldier!
It's your last chance.
America is a coward, reveal!
Lewis soldier!
For all that, your fault.
His friends are more prisoners of war.
They are guilty for what you did.
And it is ...
Is the death.
Let them go.
Shoot, but not hurt.
It's not right, damn it!
You know it's not fair!
Last chance!
Four.
Fire!
Arise, sir. - Save women, Lewis.
I will not leave, sir. - I order you, soldier.
I will not leave, sir.
Where is Maxwell?
The Maxwell, will not come.
We have to go!
Soldier.
The Third Reich, which ordered the immediate execution.
How to get there?
Fine.
Look! This saw?
Yes they are.
Be alert, sir.
Well done Lewis!
Well done, my son!
We have to go, sir!
Two minutes.
I told them I'm going to wait until 16:00.
Germans! - Comes a jeep to here, sir!
You can see? - I'm trying, sir.
Be ready.
Wait!
They are Americans.
