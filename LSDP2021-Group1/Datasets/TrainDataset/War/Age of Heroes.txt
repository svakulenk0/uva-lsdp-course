France. May, 1940.
Come on.
Come on.
We're ok. Get down.
We're .
Where the hell is he?
Shut up.
Get down.
Come on.
Watch out for rocks.
We are finished.
Be still. We're fine.
Come on, Reines.
Come on, Reines.
Is he?
Silence. Quiet.
What we do, Smithy?
Watch the rocks.
Easy.
Come on, get up.
I'm coming!
Cover me.
oh Christ!
Well, my friend.
Here they come.
Cover us.
- We gotta go.
- Shut up, yes.
Watch, I'm on it.
- Here they come.
- Throw him.
At 11:00 o'clock.
Grenade! get down!
Come on, now. Come on.
Come on, get moving.
Come on in silence.
We lost. We will not die.
We're fuckin dead.
Shut up.
Get your rifle up. Get your rifle up!
Alright...Listen, we have
back 12 miles to get to the coast.
As we see a boat ride.
Gotta keep our head boys,
don't lose it now
We've come too far.
Stay alert.
We stay sharp.
We're gonna get through this.
- Alright?
- Alright.
We'll be fine, we just have
to do what we know.
Look at me. Look at me!
We'll be in pub tomorrow
night having a bloody beer, right?
What the people of yours?
If they had better come with me.
Let's go.
Hold!
Advance man and be recognized!
- Easy...easy, boy.
- Don't shoot.
- We're British.
- Oh bloody hell, we're glad to see you long.
- Anybody got smoke?
- Identify yourself.
The 3 Little Pigs.
Don't get old slack with me.
Unit.
West Kent, sir.
Where is your platoon commander?
Dead, sir.
- Platoon sergeant?
- Dead.
I would appreciate to give us some
eat, some days my men do not eat.
No, but I have a job for you.
Report to the company Sergeant-Major.
We're digging in.
Maybe ambush these bastards.
Ambush?
Do you know what's coming?
Don't you dare to question me, Corporal.
- Is this the way off Dunkirk?
- No, you're digging in.
I have orders to hold line,
and we will hold the bloody line.
Orders are orders.
And I was given orders.
And I'm giving you an order.
What sort of soldier are you?
I wish you luck and all dare.
But we're going to Dunkirk.
Those were the last orders
given us by our sergeant.
Or you stay right here and you will
fight or I have you arrested.
For now, we have
finished fighting.
Let's go, boys.
- Sgt.
- Corporal!
- Calm down.
- What do you do?
- Put it down.
- We are on the same side.
Easy boy
Come on.
Live to fight another day.
You ain't gonna stop these bastards now.
- You stay and we're gonna make it, believe me.
- You're deserters, don't you?
Bloody cowards...I should
have you shot.
Arrest these men.
- Thank you.
- Come on, Sophie.
The Major: what he's like?
Typical royal navy marine.
Rough, tough and quite handsome, actually.
A quite unconventional
officer, actually.
Some say it has
Lucky to be Major.
But I was investigating and
father has a great story.
He fought all over the
world, including the pole.
It has been part of operations
special since 1939.
Good morning, ladies.
Many stories to tell.
Sounds familiar?
- Sophie.
- Yes?
- Have you ever loved?
- What does that mean?
Major.
Come in.
Splendid, Jack. What's up to you?
Steiner.
Thanks, Lindsey.
- I guess that has been introduced.
- No.
- But that manner.
- Sorry.
Mayor Jones, this is
Lieutenant Mortensen.
And of course, both know
Holbrook. Please take a sit.
Thank you.
I thought you had
lost interest in this war.
In fact, I'm not. I moved to
Boston when I was 14 years old.
It is hard to not
interested in this fight.
Mortensen, has agreed to help out.
- Unofficially, of course.
- Call it an investment interest.
If you want to see some action.
Jack, I'm afraid your instructor
position will be revoked.
I'm operational?
Operation Grendel.
- What do you know RDF?
- RDF?
- It relates to the defence.
- It stay for range and direction finding.
It is part of the line of defence
we've adopted along our coastline.
- Radar, is it?
- Quite right.
The technology is what can
make us win this war.
The problem is:
Jerry has it too.
Use radar to reach
their objectives, while
our guys are still navigating
by compass in the bloody stars.
The disastrous RAF raid on ? in December
were detected at 75 miles from
the German coast by RDF.
They're building these things from
Norway to southern France.
The German RDF
known as Freire
and this is the Freire research center,
here, in the mountains.
We believe, if they have the new
technology, it will be here.
The admiral allowed me to
set up a commando unit.
Smaller, more versatile raiding party.
What I need from you is to infiltrate
one of these Freire stations
cause as much chaos as you can and get
the intelligence back intact.
We have one window, an opportunity.
Officially, you won't even
exist as a unit.
I need to know that you acquiest to that.
How many men do I have?
One eight men team
of specialists.
This operation won't be officially sanctioned,
I'm afraid... but we only have six weeks.
Any longer than that will risk
any chance of night cover
I need any maps, any photographs and
all the intelligence you can.
- Mortensen, you know this area?
- I know the terrain. It is very harsh.
I used to camp in the
mountains when I was a kid.
Good. You can help
to instruct the team.
I need these men.
Brightling is in prison, but we need him.
I see. I'll make a call.
Major.
They are together, you know.
A couple.
Maybe I should put a stop to it?
How is Grace?
Due any momemnt.
Splendid.
My mother should have
joined you lot.
It's for the best.
- I do not want you in London.
- Yes, it is the best.
It's always for the bloody best.
Is it right or to the
left, I always forget?
It's left.
What happened to the instructor's post?
- Grace, I never said I was going to stop...
- You said you'd be an instructor.
Grace, please. Don't make this
harder than it already is.
Jack, please.
How many fatherless children there
will be when this war is done?
I want yours to know you.
You are here because you are scam.
Have disappointed everyone.
Yourself.
You units, your King and your country.
I'm here to put you right,
to put you back on track.
You will not go without understanding what
means to be a decent human being.
Not a coward, deserter
thief or rapist.
Eyes forward.
What if I say not?
Alone.
Who's this one?
Private Reines, sir.
Private Reines. Striking an officer,
disobeyed orders, cowardice. Shall I go on?
You are a bloody disgrace.
It was a mistake. I should
be gone back to the West Kent.
Save your speech
for your court-martial.
Why did you join the army, son?
- You wanted to see the world?
- It was either that or go to prison, dad.
You will increase the charges.
Damn stop giving orders, sir.
Are you okay?
Speaking of brave,
and see who jumps.
Sergeant, the hill, one
hour. Full weight, go.
Go go go.
You are stupid. You
are nothing. Move your asses.
Get up.
Move.
I have a heart attack.
Follow the group.
Damn!
- Rot alone, damn worm.
- I cannot breathe.
He doesn't need any help. He is
special. Aren't you, Brightling?
He is a commando, isn't it?
Yes. Come on.
Is it not true, you fucking bastard?
Let go, I'll show you.
I cannot move the damn legs.
Come on. I'm not disappointed.
You two, take the pole.
So you were commando.
No, I wasn't.
How was it?
I heard about you boys.
I never knew you existed.
I thought it was propaganda,
you know that.
If we can get out of here.
Escape.
I have got something, cooking.
We can get out of here.
Change the names.
Become commando and
kill a few fucking Nazis.
Trust me.
I know what I mean.
Serious.
I'm a commando, man.
- Major Jones.
- Colonel.
I got a call from the guards.
Good.
So ...
- Something big for today.
- Strictly routine.
- I came to pick up one of my men.
- That's right, Brightling.
I think he's doing some exercise.
What do you think they do,
damn lazy? Follow the step.
Corporal. Brightling needs
an encouragement.
What the hell is it?
- Sergeant Major!
- Leave him alone.
Shit.
Water.
What the bloody hell have
you done to him?
Marsh.
Are you okay?
- Stay away.
- Take off.
He was helping him, idiots. Let him go.
What's your name?
- Bob Reines, West Camp, sir.
- Pick up this kitten and follow me.
- Do you take him away?
- Yes.
Room for one more?
What are you doing here?
- A misunderstanding, sir.
- I didn't ask for excuses.
Striking an officer and cowardice.
But I am no coward
the officer, he deserved it.
- Get me out, please.
- I'm afraid not.
Alright, Syd, here we go.
Head down, head down.
Major...terribly sorry about your man.
Good luck.
Get back in row, Reines.
- Please Major, I want to be a commando, sir.
- Sorry, not this time.
Reines, get back in line.
- I hope you do well.
- I'm wasted here.
Can you control your man? The entire
day has been a total embarrassment.
Yes, sir.
Commando is a special breed, you
always have a chance.
As you go out, you find us.
Reines.
Bollocks.
Hold on to that man.
He tries to escape.
Get back.
- Don't be stupid, son.
- I'm not being stupid...
The Major is taking me out
of here, right now.
- He's not.
- I think I might be, Sergeant Major.
Now why don't we all calm down?
I'll drive you out.
Don't try anything silly.
Get in the car.
Get into the car Major.
Get back in line you faggots.
See you, boys.
I'll shoot you!
Right, I'm out, I found ya,
I want to be a commando.
Just like that?
- You said that.
- I know what I said.
- You gave me a note.
- I didn't.
But I prompted.
Syd, said he had something cooking.
He said he had something cooking?
So you thought it was
a signal to do this.
What? I'm a fool.
You bloody stupid!
I should return you back just for that.
If you take me back I'm a dead man.
- You seen many action?
- France, just before Dunkirk.
- What you think to?
- A bloody carnage.
- And you climb?
- Like a monkey.
Right.
Look after Syd, he's dehydrated.
Sips of water, little and often.
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
- Not yet a commando, yet.
- No.
If you fail any part of this test, you go
straight back to the prison, do you understand?
Yes, sir.
- How do we pass the police?
- I don't know
If you pull over me a gun again
will be a dead man.
You have cold blood, you know, boy?
Stop what you
are doing and follow me.
Repórtense, move.
Come here quickly.
Stand to attention.
Good morning, gentlemen.
It's good to see you here.
Go ahead, Sergeant.
To my right here is the Sergeant
Grey. I'm Sgt McKensy .
You can call me, Mac
Most of you already know me.
Those that don't be prepared for
a big fucking surprise.
- Do not look ahead, Gable.
- Aye, sir.
- I like your moustache, laddie.
- Thanks, Sarge.
I hope we had a great time.
Gentlemen, after I'm finished with
you, you wish had never been born.
Do not underestimate me.
And never fuck with me.
- Do I make myself understood?
- Yes, sergeant.
- I can't fucking hear you!
- Yes, sir.
It is vital that we move quickly
and covertly as a team.
- Look at the man beside you.
- Look at him.
Get to know him.
You will eat with him, you will shave
with him and you will piss with him.
You'll trust him for life.
Right.
Let's try for our
first tactic of attack.
Squadron underway.
Come on, get moving.
Come on Reines.
- Hit him.
- Dale hard
Time.
Okay, Gable. The
moustache is perfect.
Move, get moving.
Reines, you're last.
You lost. You lost the game.
Move your asses. Move!
In a line, in a line.
Get in line.
Stand down.
Go back in line.
The FS commando knife.
This was designed especially for
what you have in mind.
Why?
Close quarter combat.
But only if we have to.
Get used to this.
Keep it on all the time.
Sergeant Mac
Come on.
Topson. To the range.
Come on, today please.
Riley, to the range.
Mortensen, to the range.
Gable, to the range.
Brightling, to the range.
Come on son I haven't got all day.
Come on Reines.
This what.
You need to learn how to use this.
Aye...let's start with the pistol.
Look at it: 9 mm, automatic.
Favoured by officers and you can see why.
Two shots to the main body mass, one to
head to finish the job.
Any questions? No? Good.
Mr. Mortensen, be my guest.
Good. Riley.
Good shooting, son. If you weren't
so fucking ugly I'd kiss you.
Who taught you to shoot so well, son?
- You did, Sergeant.
- Me? Never.
- "You did, Sergeant".
- What are you talking about?
Mr. Reines.
If you need a door
back, I'll give you a call.
Sorry, Sarge.
It is my weak side.
Reines.
Where did you learn to shoot so well?
- Cowboy movies.
- Oh, really?
God...Have we Jessie James
here, have we?
Well Mr. Reines, for being so fucking funny,
I think you deserve a little run, don't you?
Don't you, Sergeant Grey?
Put it over your head, sir. Above.
Follow me sir, come on.
Shut up!
Lift the arms Reines.
Yes Sergeant.
Is it painful son?
Yes, sir.
Pain, Reines, it's just
weakness leaving the body, son.
Step forward. Stand up!
What do you think they teach you?
Discipline.
- Something you have an aversion to.
- Sir, I ...
Shut up. I'm talking!
I mean, what is your problem? well?
- Nothing, sorry.
- Sorry?
Sorry.
So you seem to say.
What's wrong?
Your mother didn't love you enough? Is that it?
Were you disappointed?
- You became a bully?
- No.
- Do not do it again.
- You're right you won't
I'm sending you back.
No!
Sir.
- Give me one good fucking reason why shouldn't.
- Because if.
Because what?
Because?
Because I've done more and achieved
more here than in my entire life.
Reines, you haven't achieved damn anything here.
One more chance. Please.
How you equip yourself in the next few days
will determine how you judge for the rest of your life.
- Depends on you.
- Thanks.
- Sergeant Grey.
- Thanks sir.
Thank you, sir.
Top with your head, Reines.
Well, looks official.
Come on, we review
internal 5 min.
Come on.
Okay, let's do it.
Mr. Reines, exit please.
- What's up, Sergeant?
- Just wait here laddie.
- Come on, Sergeant.
- Hello.
After you
Rest, soldier.
So...you are my escaped convict, are you?
- Can't you speak?
- Yes, sir.
I am. I did, sir
I want he back. It's a bloody mess.
- Some people want your head.
- Sorry, sir.
If these were past, the
major Jones would be court-martialled
And you would be shot.
But these are extraordinary times.
And major Jones is
an exceptional leader.
You're in luck.
I persuaded her to let you
stay in this operation.
- Thank you, sir.
- Don't thank me.
- I won't leave you down.
- No you won't.
I'd rather either not take notes.
Gentlemen, we are the masters
of our own fate.
Or at least it should be.
For this reason, I like many others,
have been exploring innovative ideas
to destroy the enemy.
I need men like you
men with courage and honour.
Indeed we live in a age of honour.
With the honour comes
duty. And sacrifice.
We're not naive to death.
But you
are the first of a new breed.
A special force. An elite smashing grab
unit working behind the enemy lines.
This trade and its success
will define all future operations.
Major.
Operation Grendel, Norway.
That's where we head to.
Now, this tower and many like them
are protecting our shores
are known as RDF.
Jerry also has the RDF,
the name is Freire.
Instruments that spotting out our
ships and aircraft miles away.
And giving Luftwaffe an advantage.
Our mission:
infiltrate and occupy Norway.
Assaulting a communication station
in the mountain range in the north.
I say assault because Jerry spoke for
demolition job but this is a secondary aim,
the primary purpose of this mission is to get out
of their hands latest generation of RDF technology.
Sergeant Ballright, you explain.
Good morning.
The basic operating principle of
RDF is very simple.
The volume of sky to be kept under surveillance
is literally flood lit with our RAF pulse energy.
The backscattered pulses or...echoes of all
aircraft within facility receives
a group of posts in the ground
stations that are received by a set of cross...
Ballright ...
In English, please.
The kit that the Major was referring to, is the latest,
most advanced technology we've seen in the world to date.
Where I work we're developing an equipment
that can jam signals from the radio towers.
However,
we believe they have developed
anti-jamming device.
So our work is completely redundant.
If they have it, I need to see it with
my eyes. Analyze it and steal its technology.
Thank you.
Sergeant Ballright, the
accompany you on your excursion.
Treat him with kindness.
Down to details.
I was informed that we have a
contact with an agent.
We have reported the operation
but we will keep contact to a minimum.
Insertion by plane. It will be
a tactical landing.
The aircraft will fly
the engines off.
A parachute drop, maybe considered
if the weather it takes.
- Extraction by sea.
- So ...
- Any questions?
- Our position.
General details, a fifth alpine
division is in the region.
We'll have to ask Beowulf the exact
numbers of the objectives.
But it's unlikely to be more
than a platoon.
- Are they any good sir?
- Yes, very.
So are we.
- They're not expecting us.
- Exactly.
I have to go back to London. Leave
to Ballright here to come acquainted.
I wish you Godspeed.
And good luck.
Okay lads, we have much
to do, outside.
You too, Mr. Ballright. Looks like
we're gonna teach you how to shoot.
I know how to shoot.
Get out of your fancy dress
and you can show us how is done.
Down your head.
You were right with him, though.
It's a clever man.
Seems to know much about
the RDF setup.
The Magnetron.
We must be careful with Jerry.
Very good.
Steiner.
May I help you?
I just wanted to give this
to commander Fleming.
Of course.
I wondered if you could give this to ...
I will make sure that she receives it.
These are the men wills
in the event of ...
I want last thing, Jack.
Beowulf's gone dark
Make sure there's
nothing to worry about.
Reines.
You right, Boss?
I want you to look out for him.
No problem.
Please, don't snatch.
Three shots each time. Again.
I did some researched on you Reines.
Studied your records.
You brought your men
back. Why don't you tell me this?
I did my best.
Yes. I put you up for a medal.
You never get it, of course.
Don't be afraid, Mr. Ballright.
Keep him close at all
times once we're on the ground.
Three shots and stops.
He is the nephew of someone important.
If it goes to crap
I get the picture, Major.
- Do you?
Yes, a babysitting job: simple.
If it looks like he's going to be captured.
Or if he is...you shoot him.
By the way ...
you deserve this.
Sir.
Very good.
Major Jones
You don't have to worry about me.
I won't slow you down.
I've already had some training.
Actually, I applied to join
a commando unit once...
But they wouldn't have me.
It seems that my talents lies elsewhere.
- I just wanted to do my bit.
- You're certainly doing your bit.
Good to have you on board.
This is Bob Reines. He will watch your
back on the ground.
- Delighted.
- A pleasure.
Short burst...more control, great accuracy.
Let's go through it again.
We meet with agent Beowulf
on the ground at...
a disused warehouse.
- Enemy forces:
- 5th alpine. That's easy, sir.
Mission:
Storming the enemy communication
center to 277,890.
Protect air infiltration and extraction.
Go to the control room, lay
diversion charges along the way.
Secure the equipment inside the base Freire.
Shoot loads.
Ensure intelligence
inside the Freire heart.
And if you ladies manage to do this without
awaken the commandant...
then we should be moving to 277995...
to watch the fireworks.
We return to the RP, then the
submarine and back home.
Aye...hug the kids and get some rest.
We leave tomorrow night.
Go! Go!
Come on.
React.
How many more are there?
What is your mission?
- Are you okay?
- I thought I was going to be shot.
So did I.
What is this?
Boss.
Gable?
Broken neck.
- Have you had contact?
- No, all clear.
Our problem is this.
We should be on the other
side of this bloody lake.
Now, we lost most of our kit and,
I'm afraid, the radio is out Sir.
Well gentlemen, we still have a trailer.
Let's move in double time.
Next stop.
Mortensen, Reines.
- Riley
- Yes?
We'll be allright. I'll take good care of him.
Beowulf is beyond that spare
Remember, codeword: Grendel.
- Response?
- Viking.
Any sign of trouble straight back here.
We will see when it's clear.
What is it?
It could be a patrol.
Let's give him a minute.
Say it.
Say it!
Viking.
- You are late.
- It's a little girl.
I already knew.
Put the gun down.
Enough, Steiner.
Never ever point at me ever again.
Not once.
Where are you from?
How am I supposed to call you?
Beowoulf?
Call me, Jensen.
ok Jensen, I'm Steiner, and he is Bob.
Hi.
Ok?
- And where's the rest of you?
- On their route.
- Jones, combined operations.
- Jensen, welcome to Norway.
- Shall we discuss about orders or you need to...?
- First I need you to contact London.
- We've lost a lot of kit...the radio, you do have radio?
- Yes. Of course.
- May you update the objective?
- Yes the Germans are busy.
They're travelling in the mountains shooting all
what they believe is the resistance.
What's this? That's hat..SS
They've been here for a month.
I told them in London.
- What shall I tell them?
- Tell this ...
Dispatch here arrived, sir.
Not good news I'm afraid.
Damn.
Send the trailer.
Will not make it.
Sir.
I need your response.
Pursue it.
- I need you to confirm numbers.
- 20 to 30 trips at the centre daily.
Plus some naval radio operators.
As you know, the approach road is
covered of heavy machinegun post here.
They also set up a lookout tower, just east of this.
Right, Mac, get on to that.
Inside the huts they said you had intelligence on this.
Michael was killed trying
to get that information.
- How long from here?
- 6 hours and 12 min, at pass.
This property is half
km south of the target.
- It's in the valley ...
- I know.
But can we continue to have
it? We need ammo, explosive.
- I have some hidden there, yes.
- Good.
I'm extracted with you
tomorrow night.
- Why?
- Orders.
- She is not Beowoulf.
- You might be right.
We may be
leading a patrol.
- This is insane.
- He managed to contact London.
She's not Beowoulf.
I do not care who he is.
She's helping us.
She compromised us
I'll put a bullet through myself.
Stay alert.
Hi.
Come on.
So the SS patrols
are hunting here.
What do you mean by SS?
She's compromised.
- Where is the rest of your team?
- Hiding or dead.
Why do not you tell us
you were compromised?
What difference would it make?
Is this supplies, no?
- Who are you?
- Steiner, what are you doing?
This girl will kill us.
You're not Beowoulf, right?
Are You?
Are you?
Now tell me,
Fuck!
He promised me that he would
take me to England.
- What his story?
- She's been at it with Mr. Beowoulf.
Rather they were dating.
Anyway, they get scrambled, they sent the SS
and he goes on his own.
And she keeps trying to transmit
like Beowoulf, no?
- Why do that?
- It's an important mission, right?
That's right.
That stupid cow thought we cheat
and knew the situation
So we just leave it like that.
Allright, ladies, shut the fuck up.
Jensen, a word.
Regardless of who you really are
- You've fulfilled your order.
- Thank you, sir.
The mission continues. I need you
to head off now to the first RV.
Tell to London now where we are.
And we are in place.
Confirm the extraction coordinates.
And you wait for as long as you can.
I want you to get in the
submarine with or without us.
You're Beowoulf until
London, you understand?
What do I tell them in London?
You tell them the truth.
Right lads, gathering.
The new teams. Brithling
Mortensen with me.
The job is the same.
Mac and his team will move to the Freire.
Set charges and move to us.
My team will move to the communication room.
Mac, we need a lot of noise
to distract these bastards.
Riley, stay up as long as possible.
Ballright, quick as you can: in and out
Right...heads down and
see you in the trailer.
Charges. I'll go
make some noise.
It ends now.
The bloody tower
should be blown up.
Brightling.
- Let's go to the Major.
- I'll stay, see you in the trailer.
More noise.
Reines.
Are you done yet?
This place is full of
secret treasures of the enemy.
We're talking precision RDF.
Give me your knife, Major.
That's incredible.
Technical manuals, recordings

- Did you see the blood out there?
- Yes.
Oh fuck.
Reines, crouch.
What do you see?

Fuck.
It's Brightling.
We need to help him.
Steiner and Mac could cover it.
No, crouch. Get down.
Damn bastards.
Fucking animals.
Germans bastards.
They're fucking animals.
Would be wise to show yourselves.
Friendly farmers no longer
available for trading.
I have your friend.
I think he'll be very happy to see you.
Won't shoot if you come out now.
Your friend will continue
to suffer until you do.
They have to Syd.
Mac, what do we do? Mac?
Take it easy.
All right, Know that we parted.
They will be watching for us. Stay low.
Miss, take this.
Are you going just sit there
and watch your friend suffer?
Now would be a very good time to come.
We have to go.
- We can not, we can not leave.
- She's right.
Very good. Enough.
Listen.
Assume firing position.
Fucking animals.
Single shots.
Conserve your ammo.
Cover me down the stretch.
When you get out, either
they are dead or not,
you're gonna fuck off to Sweden.
- Mac, I can stay.
- I have no time for this, son.
- Make sure you take it.
- Of course.
Okay, do it.
Damn.
Mac
Ceasefire.
You should be in Sweden, Mckensy.
With all due respect, sir.
But fuck off.
Do they expect?
Ceasefire.
- Ballright is safe.
- No way out.
You have no chance to escape.
Go, go.
Are you enjoying this?
- Go.
- Shut up.
What do you want me to do with this, sir?
- Go.
- You'll be prisoners of war.
Stop your friend suffering.
Fuck, that is unbearable.
Obviously he has orders
to take us alive.
And torture the truth out of us.
But we live yet.
Save him from his suffering.
No.
Put it in order to
suffering of his friend.
Or I will.
Right, time to leave Reines.
- Steiner. Take Reines to see Sweden.
- What?
I need grenades.
And in 30 seconds. end up with this.

a better chance.
Make sure you arrive safely.
You are a bloody good commandos.
