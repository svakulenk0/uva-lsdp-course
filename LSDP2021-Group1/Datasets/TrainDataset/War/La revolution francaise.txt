P AR I S,  1 7 7 4
Alas, Majesty, today Phoebus
is eclipsed by rain
Your Majesty is our only sun
Sire, the compliment is over
I can't believe it !
They didn't even say one word to you !
Desmoulins and Robespierre,
no talking ! Back in line !
The French Revolution "The Years of Hope"
And all that !
Your Majesty will make Fortune blush !
Dear Madame de Polignac,
you bring me luck
Your Majesty has lost
Here I am, penniless again
Now I have to tell the poor man
I can't pay my debts...
... so he'll have to do it.
After all, I am his wife !
The fact is, every day
the country gets deeper in debt
The costs of the court...
The Queen's personal expenses...
Our participation in
the American war of independence...
... which cost us 2,000 million livres
Frankly, the outlook
is not very encouraging
What do you advise, Monsieur Necker ?
Sire we have two options :
First, default and let
the consequences fall where they may
No, Monsieur Necker
- Your second option ?
- Summon the Estates General
It's the only body capable
of raising the taxes to pay the debt
But we haven't had
to resort to that for 150 years
Sire, it's inevitable
This practice is quite uncivilized !
I'll have to ask Dame Etiquette
the proper method of milking
Mother ! Look ! I can ride all by myself !
It's wonderful, darling !
And now, dear brethren,
we're holding a meeting today...
... March 6, in the church vestibule
It's to draw up
the List of Grievances for this parish
All men 25 years and older who pay taxes
are invited to come and contribute
Our duty is to seize this opportunity
to tell the King...
... the truth about what
is amiss in his kingdom
I've had enough of lugging stones
around to please his lordship !
- You want useless chores abolished !
- That's right !
And the salt tax too - when the salt
we buy is rotten and full of dirt !
Please, give him
a chance to write it down
As a doctor, I demand
that taxation be shared equally
By what right are the nobles
and the priests exempt ?
And why can only
the nobility be officers ?
Free access to all military,
civil and even church positions !
- Ecclesiastic ?
- Exactly !
What are you writing,
Camille Desmoulins ?
No more privilege, no more
humiliation, and equality for all
And Liberty too !
"No more bread"
Too proud to say hello
to your old friends ?
Someone thinks he's a bigshot !
I wasn't elected
Camille ! They're idiots.
They don't know a thing
You're not at Versailles ?
Not this time - I lost.
Lucie, go to your room
You good-for-nothing ! If you try to see
my daughter I'll have you whipped !
And arrested like a common criminal !
Sir, I beg you to believe...
... that I care very deeply
for your daughter
Take my advice, Danton, get yourself
elected as a Deputy for Paris
But do it now, or it will be too late
Look at the stuff being written :
things are changing !
What change ?
Your kind and the clergy
will always outvote the commons
- My kind ?
- Yes, the nobility, Monsieur de Mirabeau
It's two against one,
and nothing will ever change
That's what you think ?
I've been elected
as a member of the Third Estate
How long can the ruling class
cling to its privileges ?
The world is moving - look at America
Privilege will never be abolished
The best we can hope for is to
spread the wealth around a little
I'm not giving up my career for that
Look
She has a sister
How about making a night of it ?
No, I have work to do
and some friends are waiting for me.
Your noble ideas vanish quickly
when a pair of tits comes in sight
Two pairs of tits
When did you add a "d'"
before your name ?
Since trying to make money in this
business ; any more stupid questions ?
That's for you...
This one's for you, and this too
I'll handle this one myself
Write a summary
A grain merchant
who's claiming the right...
... to call himself
Viscount Something-or-other
A bloody fool, but he pays well
Why are you attacking me ?
I don't hoard food like some people
You know it Danton ! Tell them !
They've already killed a baker
Everyone knew he hoarded grain
I don't blame them
They ought to hang all these damned
profiteers, to set an example
Cut out your usual speech, Marat.
This time it was Legendre,
but I know he's honest
What difference does it make
to a starving crowd ?
- Will she recover ?
- Probably not
Besides, she has a broken neck
Gabrielle, I'm hungry !
Mirabeau was right. Things are changing
I should have stood for election
- Why ?
- To be a Deputy for Paris
- Why ? You want to be ?
- No, I need to be
That smells good
Action, Gabrielle... action
Have you ever in your life
just stood by and watched ?
The more tempting the prospect...
... the more I want to get my hands on it
I believe that the three orders
assembled here...
... will cooperate
for the general good of the state
I declare myself
the first friend of my people
And I welcome
the representatives of the nation...
... it is my glory
to command by divine right
That's Lafayette
The Marquis de Lafayette ? From America ?
Yes, my lord. The hero of the American
War of Independence
Gentlemen. His Majesty
has summoned you here...
... in order to remedy a deficit which
has raised so much comment in Europe
- Who are those men all in black ?
- The Third Estate, my lord
What is the Third Estate ?
Those who are neither nobles nor priests
That's a lot of people
It is thus my duty to demonstrate
to you in detail...
... the absolute necessity
of financial assistance
This is why you have received
the rare privilege...
... of being assembed
here in the Estates General
It's not Versailles, but it's
comfortable without costing too much
- Have a seat
- I prefer the bed
- You don't mind eggs ?
- Not at all
- You're a lawyer, I hear
- Like you
I made the mistake of moving to Paris
Too many lawyers, not enough clients
They want you to vote by order, right ?
The clergy plus the nobility
make it 2 to 1
At that rate, we'll always lose
But if we vote as individuals,
the Third Estate has the majority
Necker isn't stupid ;
he knows what he wants
He means well, but he's a banker.
And he's Swiss
The problem is they don't live
in the same world we do
Well ?
It would be enough if the lower
clergy, the poorest, join us
If nothing changes, they won't get
any money - it's as simple as that
Remember ? At Louis le Grand ?
Old Boiteux ?
- "What is the Third Estate ?"
- "Nothing !"
- "And what does it want ?"
- "Everything !"
It's so long ago
But you haven't changed
Always neat, with every hair in place
My one luxury.
But you haven't changed either !
A number of the clergy
have joined the Third Estate
They say they form 96% of the country
and plan to form a National Assembly...
... without Your Majesty's assent
- Just as I predicted !
- Please, brother
The best solution, Monsieur Necker...
... would be to address the 3 orders...
... and inform them
that their actions are illegal
Excuse me, Sire, but I feel the situation
requires diplomacy, not confrontation
Our authority is all that's left,
Monsieur Necker
Authority and obedience
by force, if necessary
- What's happening ?
- They won't let us in.
It's an outrage !
To the Tennis Court !
Back to the changing room, gentlemen !
Bailly ! Take the chair !
Silence !
Let us take an oath, here and now
To never separate, to reassemble
wherever circumstances demand...
... until we've given France
a constitution
I swear !
Therefore I declare void,
illegal and unconstitutional...
... the acts of the
so-called National Assembly...
... which is meeting despite my orders
I am the sole guardian
of my people's welfare
And if you abandon me
in such a weighty endeavor...
... it is you who will be abandoned,
and not me
I order you to disperse at once...
... and return to the rooms
set aside for your respective orders...
... to resume your meetings
Vive le roi !
By what right
do you occupy that seat, sir ?
My name is Bailly - I'm an astronomer
Member of the Academy of Science
and Member for Paris
These gentlemen have elected me
President of the National Assembly
You've all heard the King
order you to disperse !
I believe that the nation in assembly
receives orders from no one
Go tell those who sent you that we
are here by the will of the people
And we won't leave
except at the point of a bayonet !
- They want to stay ?
- Yes, Sire
To hell with them then ! Let them stay !
The Third Estate is not making a
challenge to the monarchy, just an appeal
If you would recognize their legal
existence to help you govern...
Wanting to share
the King's power is treason
You should hang them all,
as an example
But if the Third Estate
has the support of the people--
Send in the troops
I advise against it, Sire
- If we could find a compromise--
- There is no compromise
Except for time
If I understand you, Monsieur Necker,
the King cannot oppose this Assembly...
... without making things worse
In that case, he shouldn't even try
But rather, agree to their demands...
... for now
But the King must prepare to respond
to their next demands with force
It appears Her Majesty understands
the situation better than any of us
The intervention of the foreign
regiments seems to me ill-advised
They are regiments from
the provinces, not foreign
And I can count on their loyalty in the
event of an insurrection in the capitol
The people do not see the uniforms,
but the men wearing them
Swiss and German troops,
most of whom don't even speak French
They don't see the love Your Majesty has
for them - just a sign of tyranny
It's what your enemies want
That is not my opinion, Monsieur Necker
Nor is it the opinion
of those I have confidence in
Then, Your Majesty, I have no choice...
... but to offer my resignation
And I to accept it
Citizens !
I've come from Versailles.
The King has dismissed Necker !
It's the signal for a St. Bartholomew's
Massacre of patriots !
Tonight Swiss and German batallions
will come out to slaughter us !
There's only one solution :
to take up arms !
To arms ! To arms !
All Paris must take up arms !
My friends, we know our enemies.
But we need a way
to recognize each other
All those who want to fight...
... proudly declare it by wearing green
Green, the color of hope
This will be our symbol !
Our uniform !
Our victory !
Look ! The police are here !
I call my brothers to liberty
You won't take me alive
And I will die gloriously rather than
see France remain in bondage !
The King has dismissed Necker.
If he uses his troops it'll cost him
My friend you can write
your memoires later. Come on !
News from the Palais Royale ;
they've called for insurrection !
- Why ?
- The King has dismissed Necker
This is a direct attack
on the will of the people...
... expressed through
their elected representatives !
Will we allow Tyranny
to triumph over Liberty ? No !
Will we allow one man the power
to wipe away in a single day...
... the hope of finally seeing
a free people in France ? No !
I want every man
of the district to be a volunteer
We will show the whole world...
... that we have no fear of these dogs...
... who dare lay siege to our city !
Sign with me !
Don't worry, we'll wake them up !
My name's Fournoyer
They call me "The American".
I was a distiller in Santo Domingo
Where will we get the weapons ?
The guns are at Les Invalides ;
and the powder at the Bastille !
Very good, Lieutenant.
Any problems ?
Just one.
If I give the order, will they fire ?
- Surely your Swiss will ?
- Probably.
But can you count on your own men ?
The powder ! The powder !
Citizens - we must have the Bastille
We want the Bastille !
They have to pull back the cannons
Make way for the delegation from the
Permanent Committee of the Hôtel de Ville
Make them remove the cannons !
I've never heard of your committee.
As of yesterday, the Members for Paris
have met at the Hôtel de Ville
They've formed a permanent committee
to maintain order in the capitol
Are you here to force a confrontation,
or find a way of avoiding it ?
- We're not here to threaten
- Then we agree on the essential points
Gentlemen, I was about to dine
Will you join me ?
- What's going on ?
- They're still inside
- Prisoners ?
- No one knows
We want the Bastille !
Apparently, sir, you are not hostile
to the people of Paris
We need you to show it. Pull back
the cannons - the Committee demands it
But why ? The cannons
have always been there
It's an insult to the people.
It's intolerable
These poor old cannons !
You've seen them; where they are
they can't fire on the people
It doesn't matter; people are afraid
You must withdraw them, Governor
- You want me to make a gesture
- Of goodwill
My compliments to Lieutenant Deflue ;
please ask him to withdraw the cannons
And close the openings
Our committee could not ask for more
Look ! They're pulling back the cannons !
To load them ! They're going to fire !
I have to alert the district !
Do you know how many
prisoners we have here ?
Seven
Four forgers, with long records
One's a murderer
And there's also an Irishman
who thinks he's Julius Caesar
Let me through - I know the Governor
He's a friend, I can talk to him
You see, I've kept my word
You must surrender the fortress, sir
Nobody said anything about that
The Permanent Committee--
The Bastille is in our district
And the distict demands that you open
the gates of the Bastille to the people
With all these innovations, it's very
difficult for an officer of the King...
... to know where his duty lies
Opening the gates is out of the question
They're telling us to enter ! Come on !
They don't understand !
They're advancing instead of leaving !
- So this is how you negotiate
- I'll go down and talk to them
The cannons !
Take aim !
- You're not going to fire !
- Don't worry
I just want to show them
that the Bastille can defend itself
Do not fire without my orders !
Sir, if you have any authority over your
district, order your people to retreat
Tell them I've promised
not to fire first
Stop ! Stop !
We have no choice
- Take aim
- No, it'll be a bloodbath
Hold your fire !
If you won't fire, we're lost
Take aim !
Fire !
Fire !
Cease fire !
What are you doing ?
We're saved !
Long live the nation !
Hey there, someone !
Lieutenant Deflue -
I have a message from the Governor
Bring a board !
Cease fire !
There's a message from the Governor !
"We have 2,000 barrels of powder
Surrender, or we will
blow up the neighborhood"
No surrender !
They must lower the drawbridge !
We won't allow it, Sir
Bring me my journal
An agreeable afternoon, Cléry
but not very successful
Not even a rabbit
"July 14 - Nothing"
Sire...
What is it ?
Sire, the Parisians
have taken the Bastille
Taken the Bastille ? What for ?
It's a revolt
No, Sire ; it's a revolution
If the troops want to fire on Liberty,
they'll find barricades in their way !
And the Cordeliers Club
will build the tallest one !
- It's just that too many died
- What did you expect ?
You can't build the kind of world you
want without breaking a few heads
Now whatever happens,
things can never be the same
That's for sure - never again
Here's the wine,
for anyone who's thirsty !
Vive Danton !
You're lovelier than ever
Just say the word and I'll stay
Write me when you get to Basle
I'll be there in a week
Persuade the King
to take refuge in Metz. You must !
He prefers to stay in Paris
To win over his faithful subjects
who want to murder him !
- I'll stay
- Goodbye
You really don't want to go ?
I can't leave you here alone
Oh, my dear, faithful friend !
No one is to shout "Vive le roi !"
Your Majesty, these keys
were presented to Henri IV...
... after he reconquered his people
Today it is the people
who have reconquered their king
So you are the Mayor of Paris,
Monsieur Bailly ?
Yes, Your Majesty
Until now, Paris has not had a Mayor
The electors decided that it was time
Ah, well, if they've decided
If Your Majesty
would be so good as to follow me
Monsieur de Lafayette,
I believe you also have something to say
Your Majesty, the volunteers
who have mobilized to defend Paris...
... have adopted
the name "National Guard"
And they have named me their General
Naturally, I could not accept this
appointment without your approval
Then I must congratulate you, General
Sire, all Parisians who love liberty...
... have adopted the colors
of the capitol : blue and red
I have noticed
But I've added the white of the monarchy
Excellent idea !
If Your Majesty would be pleased
to pin this cockade to your hat...
... your loyal subjects
would be overjoyed.
Perhaps you could pin it on for me
Gentlemen, I have some news for you
I have ordered the withdrawal
of the troops presently in the capitol
And this morning
I wrote to Monsieur Necker...
... to ask him to rejoin my ministry
Such back-breaking labor,
Monsieur le Comte
It couldn't go on any longer
August 4, 1789
These attacks on the property of the
nobility, across the entire country...
... are not acts of common vandalism
These attacks should fill us with pride
They are the funeral pyres of privilege !
Tell the people that you recognize
the injustice of the rights...
... acquired during
the dark days of ignorance
Our colleague from Bretagne is right.
The people's anger is a just anger
I, Viscount de Noailles
propose that all privileges...
... and rights of the nobility
be abolished
I, Count de Beauharnais propose
that henceforth all occupations...
... be open to all: nobles and commoners
I, Duke de la
Rochefoucault-Liancourt propose...
... that the National Assembly
abolish slavery
And recognize
that blacks are human beings
I, Bishop of Nancy,
renounce the possessions...
... that the Church has unjustly
acquired for too long
They're drunk on fine words
and good intentions
They'll wake up with a nice hangover
And they'll go back on everything
they've given up
Citizens, listen !
The Assembly has declared
freedom of religion
Who gives a damn ?
But much more important ;
they've declared freedom of the press !
I'll start my paper, Georges !
I've already got the name :
Revolutions of France and Brabant
Write, Camille.
It's what you do best
I'll listen to the people,
and I'll say everything :
Their concerns, their hopes, their joys
But to understand, not manipulate them
Without betraying
the truth or my conscience
I'll find you the money
The representatives of the French people,
formed into the National Assembly...
... considering that ignorance,
forgetfulness...
... or contempt for the Rights of Man...
... are the sole cause of public suffering
and government corruption...
... have resolved to express
in a solemn declaration...
... the natural, inalienable
and sacred rights of man
I ask you to rise, gentlemen
Article 1 : Men are born and remain
free and equal before the Law
Social distinctions can be founded
only upon public utility
These rights are Liberty, Property,
Security and Resistance to Oppression
The nation is essentially
the source of all sovereignty
The Law may only forbid
activities harmful to society
Whatever is not forbidden by Law
cannot be hindered
The Law is the expression
of the general Will
... and equally eligible
for every public position and honor
No man can be accused, arrested or
imprisoned unless by force of Law
Every man is presumed innocent
until proven guilty
No one can be persecuted
for his beliefs, including religious
The free expression
of ideas and opinions...
... is one of the most
precious rights of mankind
All citizens may speak,
write and publish freely...
... except as determined by the Law
in order to preserve Liberty
The safeguard of the Rights of Man and
the citizenry requires a public force
This force is formed
for the benefit of all
The right of private property
is sacred and inviolable
... except when the common good
legitimately requires it
I've done my best, Monsieur Necker,
but I will not sign
Neither the Decree on the Abandonment
of Privileges, nor the Rights of Man
How will the Church survive
without its tithes ?
And the minor nobility without
the revenue of their peasants ?
Sire, the nobility
and the clergy themselves--
I know
But why the Rights of Man ?
I am the King !
How can one share what is abolute ?
Your Majesty must not
underestimate the risk--
This is why I summoned
the Regiment of Flanders to Versailles
I know that I can count on them
Governing is a serious matter
To do it you have to find
a genuine balance of power...
... between the executive
and the legislative
That's why you defended the veto power ?
Whether it's a king, a president
or something else, it doesn't matter
An unlimited, all-powerful Assembly
will lead to disaster
Why ?
Because all the power
is concentrated there
What's important is sovereignty
It must be shared between
the King and the Assembly
Impossible
In that case, you'll create
an even worse dictatorship
Excuse me - I'm expecting my confessor
A little patience !
I'm nearly finished my work
Kiss me !
Gabriel-Honoré I'll give you 5 minutes -
not one more
I've tried to make it
less uncompromising
If you won't sign now,
there's nothing more I can do
It's excellent, as always
Let me sign
As usual, you get what you want
And you, at least, a decent meal
You're a corruptor, Monsieur de Mirabeau
If it gives you any comfort, look around
Nothing in this house is paid for
Except for you
Even the servants
are worried about their wages
How do you do it ?
It's the art of keeping
But two of them inevitably are your own
Do you advise me
to go to confession ?
Not necessarily
I find I have a few extra matters
to attend to
Gentlemen ! A toast : to the King !
Please rise, gentlemen
Thank you all
I'm so happy
to find myself among friends
We'll give our last drop of blood
for Your Majesty
Wait your turn; there's enough for all !
Are you alright ? Where do you live ?
Look at me ! I want to help
I haven't eaten for 3 days
Down with the Assembly !
And no more tricolors !
Gentlemen - I'll never forget this !
Once again,
the Austrian bitch is responsable...
... for this court-orchestrated
counter-revolution
Exclamation mark after revolution
Marat has everything
on the Versailles banquet
People of Paris,
the events at Versailles...
... are an insult to Liberty
I call for rebellion
No... for insurrection
That's better
To arms ! To arms !
- "To arms" twice ?
- And again !
It's for the paper ?
For the greatest paper of all :
The walls of Paris
Bread ! Give us bread !
If you refuse to march on Versailles...
... to demand the King listen
to his people, then we will !
We'll bring back the baker
and the baker's wife !
And the baker's boy !
To Versailles !
An order from the Commune :
You're to lead
the National Guard to Versailles
To bring the King
and his family back to Paris
We are the King's Guard,
not his jailors !
The women of Paris are marching
to Versailles to demand bread !
Let's march with them
as a matter of honor
The cause that we've fought for
is lost...
... if you won't show that you're ready
to fight for what you've won !
Make way for the President
of the National Assembly !
No more than four
And no pikes
That's enough !
Ladies, welcome
What can I do for you ?
Your Majesty, these four women speak on
behalf of the women of Paris
All Paris wishes to know Your Majesty's
attitude toward the Rights of Man, and--
Perhaps His Majesty would prefer
to hear directly from these women
Your Majesty...
Bread...
Well, Monsieur Mounier,
here we are in fresh difficulties
Bread...
Bread ?
You will have bread ; I promise
I beg you not to stay. Come with us
I am the King ! I can't flee
Is it better to be a prisoner ?
At least you could try--
The mob is blocking the stables ;
it is impossible to get out
You see ? We thought we had some choice
We were wrong
Where are my glasses ?
Please, Monsieur Mounier,
re-read your text aloud
I accept purely and simply
the Articles of the Constitution...
... and the Rights of Man as submitted
to me by the National Assembly
Is that agreeable, Your Majesty ?
Does that matter anymore ?
As you can see, His Majesty has signed
History will remember Your Majesty as
the greatest of France's kings
Bread and flour
are on their way to Paris
Perhaps it's time for everyone
to go home, Monsieur de Lafayette
Sire, these gentlemen
are from the Paris Commune
And what is it the people of Paris want ?
They wish that the National Guard take
charge of the King's personal security
You can arrange that,
Monsieur de Lafayette ?
Also the removal of royal troops, whose
presence is an insult to the people
Is that all ?
The Parisians also demand
that the King return to Paris
That requires some thought
It's been a long day
We will discuss this further
in the morning
Good night, Monsieur
de Lafayette, gentlemen
I beg Your Majesty to let me
stand guard outside your room
No. The rumors
only aggravate their hatred
Go to bed, Axel.
I'll try to do the same
