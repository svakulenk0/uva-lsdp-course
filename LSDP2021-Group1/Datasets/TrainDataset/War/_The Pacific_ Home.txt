"And the people went their ways,
each to his own ship.
Then bethought them of the blessed
boon of sleep;
But Achilles still wept for thinking
of his dear comrade,
And sleep, before whom
all things bow,
Could take
no hold upon him.
This way
and that did he turn
As he thought of all
they had done together,
And all
they had gone through"...
hey, you're not
listening to me.
Oh, no, sure we are.
"...thought of all
they had done together,
And all they had
gone through
Both on the fields
of battle
And the waves
of the weary seas."
How about
a comic, Amos?
I've got "Snookums,"
"Phantom, "Blondie."
-
- What's your favorite?
- The Japs surrendered.
- Man: What?
- What did he say?
- The war is over.
Man #2:
Did you hear that?
Definite.
On the radio.
- Man #3: The war's over!
- The war's over.
- It's over.
-
- It's over.
-
- Can you believe it?
- Yes!
- Man: It's over! It's over!
-
-
-
-
- Man: I need a drink!
- Man #2: What do you got?
- Come on now.
- Here, open wide.
- You're wasting it.
You see that?
Line of stars angling up?
- Yup.
- That's Snafu's pecker.
-
- Hey, boys.
You've got a nice little party going on
down there, Lieutenant.
Ah. A little
victory party.
Can't believe
it's over, huh?
Sort of a "What do
you do now?"
Here.
Have a little V-J Day
party of your own.
Thanks, Lieutenant.
"What do
we do now?"
What an idiot.
Well, I'll show you
what I'm doing now.
Well, there it is:
My first official act
of peacetime.
Snaf.
-
-
- Jesus. Nothing's changed.
-
Man: I thought the same thing
when I got back.
Funny. Here.
There. You can
keep the change.
I ain't touching that.
I might've jumped into Normandy,
but at least I got some liberties
in London and Paris.
You Gl-rines, you got nothing
but jungle rot and malaria.
Welcome home.
Marion: If you'd just
given us some warning...
a phone call,
a telegram or something.
There. Ah.
We'll get this stuff
out of here first thing.
I don't know where
we're gonna put it all.
John: Well, half this junk
we can throw away.
That's not what you said
when we lugged it all up here.
Oh, that was
four years ago.
I'll clear a corner
and make do.
Absolutely not. We will have this place
spic and span as always.
This whole box can
go to the junk man.
Let's give him a moment.
Can we have three Cokes?
I could stand for some
whiskey instead of that.
- Coming up.
-
Bartender:
There you go.
- Burgin: Thanks, Snaf.
- Snafu: My pleasure.
Hiya.
I'm Merriell Shelton.
How about I take you
to the back of the train
and you can show me
your caboose?
- Man: Ouch.
- Did I tell you?
Feisty.
Snafu just got pinked
on the train home.
If we'd had been here
six months ago,
that broad would've
given us all blowjobs.
-
- Lied to again.
This entire division
didn't do
that "plus six months"
horseshit we did.
They got home a week after V-J Day...
parades, pretty girls.
all over.
Not so much
as a complimentary beer.
Somebody had
to stay and clean up after the war.
I suppose I'm gonna
have to get a job too.
- Doing what?
- I don't know.
Anything between digging ditches
and owning a bank.
-
- Nah.
First I've got to
get Florence home.
- Wait. Florence from Melbourne?
- Mm-hmm.
You're shipping her
all the way over here
and this is the first
we hear about it?
Come on, Snaf.
That was in Okinawa.
Figured it'd be bad luck
to talk about it then.
- Well, when is she coming?
- I don't know.
I cabled her,
but we've been at sea.
I guess I'm gonna
find out soon enough
whether I'm getting
married or not.
What about you,
Sledgehammer?
I'm just hoping this Florence girl
comes to her senses.
You got a job
lined up in Mobile?
No. No job, no girl,
no plans.
How long do you
think that's gonna last?
- As long as the sheriff lets me.
-
I'm gonna get
that girl.
- Oh, leave her alone.
- You boys watch.
- I'm gonna get that girl.
- You've been saying that
- about every girl since San Diego.
-
Mrs. Basilone,
I'm Lena.
I recognize you
from the photos Johnny sent.
Well, come in.
Lena...
he says
you're beautiful.
George.
I heard
so much about you.
The last time
I saw him in Honolulu,
he couldn't stop
talking about you.
He was just about
to ship out.
Would you like
a coffee?
No. Thank you.
I'm fine.
Please sit down.
Thank you.
You have
a very nice home.
Thank you.
The 4th Marines
are mustered out.
How about you?
I'm waiting
for orders.
Hurry up and wait.
Do you...
do you need anything?
No. No, I'm not
here for...
John's insurance money
is gonna help you out,
right, Lena?
Actually, he never
signed the papers.
George: He never signed?
That's $10,000.
It's okay.
I'm all right.
George:
I saw his grave on lwo.
He's got lots of good marines
on all sides of him.
He...
he would've
appreciated that.
Are you sure
about that coffee?
Maybe something stiffer?
No.
I came by because
I thought
you should have this.
- There's my little brother.
- Porter: Jewett!
Jewett, Texas!
No sign of Florence.
Melbourne's a hell
of a long way, Burgie.
It'll take Florence a while to get
from Australia to here.
Thanks...
for doing all you did to keep us from
getting our fool heads shot off.
You're good marines.
- It's him.
- It is?
- It's Robert.
-
You made quite
an entrance, Bob.
The whole room is buzzing.
I hope they meet
their deadlines.
We're all
mighty proud of you,
proud of all
you soldiers.
I was a marine.
We're proud
of all of you.
So now you're back.
I'm guessing
you're here for a job.
That's why
they made you the editor.
I'll take
my former position.
Well, you still want
to cover local sports?
Yup... to start with.
Here's why:
That guy you've got writing
the column right now...
he's got no snap,
no style.
The prose just lays there like
spilled ink on newsprint.
You need to send him to obits
and give me his desk.
- I do?
- For the sake of the paper.
And when did you
see me demoting him and hiring you?
- Today is good.
- Today?
Bergen Catholic plays
Don Bosco Prep this afternoon.
The kickoff is
at 3:00, so...
- I'd better get going.
-
Shouldn't we talk
about salary?
$10 a week raise
will do it.
- I will give you $7.
- I'd have taken $5.
-
-
What are
you looking at?
Are you a Jap?
Honestly, 'cause you
sneak up like one.
You are spying
on Vera Keller.
- My God.
- Ma.
She never gave you
the time of day.
And she's dating
an officer, of course.
-
- Look at that fancy car.
Did you come up here
for a reason?
To get you to stop banging
on that typewriter.
It's called working, Ma.
Not sitting there
like that, it isn't.
Look at this mess.
Mmm, your dress blues.
You've never
even worn them.
I think you would've
looked nice in them.
Porter:
New Orleans Crescent City,
home to the Delta Blues
and the French Quarter.
Watch your wallets,
pockets and watches.
This is New Orleans.
Man:
Hot links!
Get your
hot links here!
Hey, how about
a hot link?
- Yes?
- Mrs. Keller.
Yes.
I'd like to speak
to Vera, please.
And who shall
I say is calling?
Robert Leckie,
Mrs. Keller.
I've lived across the street from you
for the last 20 years.
Of course.
Welcome home, Robert.
Let me just see
if she can come to the door.
Bob Leckie.
You're back.
I was afraid you wouldn't
remember me either.
Oh, I remember you.
The last time I saw you was
in church right before
you shipped out.
So...
you look well.
Nice uniform.
Thank you.
I've been wondering
if you would grant me
the pleasure
of taking you out.
You want
to take me out?
- Yes, I do.
-
Uh, I have
a date tonight.
When the doorbell rang,
I thought you were him.
- Well, there he is.
-
Nice car.
Hey. Robert Leckie.
Charles Dunworthy.
- Vera.
- Mmm. Army, huh, Charlie?
Where'd you serve?
I just graduated
from West Point.
Lieutenant.
Congratulations.
Too bad you missed
the whole show.
Vera...
how about
another time?
Maybe tomorrow night?
What's going on here?
I just asked Vera if she'd like
to have dinner.
Huh. Nice try.
She's not interested.
Actually, I don't have any plans
for tomorrow night.
Oh, is that right?
Really?
Obviously I've been wasting
a lot of gasoline.
Good night, Vera.
Well, it looks like I am free
for dinner tonight.
So what are you gonna do
now that you're home?
Oh, I'm back writing for
"The Bergen County Record."
Oh, we don't get
"The Record."
I'll talk
to subscriptions.
You're staring.
Oh. I'm sorry.
No.
Actually, I'm not.
Three years ago
in a miserable part of the Pacific,
I was laying
in the mud,
dreaming about a moment
like this with you.
You get right to it,
don't you?
In the mud?
Afraid so.
You must've been
through a lot.
Well, here we are.
- Mm-hmm.
- So what's next?
I don't know.
I didn't get that far.
And why me?
Why not Rita Hayworth
or Betty Grable?
Because I know you.
Bob, you don't...
you don't
really know me.
You're right.
Yeah.
I think...
I don't...
I don't know
how to do this.
Bob, you're doing fine.
This is fine.
It's a start.
You know, I wrote you
a lot of letters while I was over there.
You did?
I didn't get any.
- I never sent 'em.
- Why?
I thought...
I didn't think
I was gonna make it,
so it didn't matter
if I sent 'em or not.
Can I read them now?
I don't
have 'em anymore.
Rain on Cape Gloucester
erased every word.
What were they like,
these letters?
Best stuff
I ever wrote.
-
-
Hey, buddy.
I appreciate you coming.
Man: Thanks so much
for picking me up.
- Hi, fella. How are you?
- Good to see you.
You gonna take this
for me or what?
Good to see you, Eugene.
We'll just
drive up to Chickasaw.
So good
to see you.
What's with
the MacArthur bit?
- Huh?
- The Mammy Yokum.
Popeye the sailor.
It calms me down.
Packing it,
cleaning it...
I always have
something to do.
What do you remember
about Mary Houston?
- Mary Houston?
- Yeah.
The Mary Houston?
Well, like everybody
else in Mobile,
- I was in love with Mary Houston.
- That's too bad for you.
- She's marrying me.
- Yeah, sure she will...
- the minute she goes blind.
- Well, I asked her.
She said yes, so you're just gonna have
to deal with it, brother.
You're saying
that Mary Houston
is gonna be
Mary Houston Phillips?
In the eyes of God
and the law.
Well, what am
I gonna hear next?
That Martians landed downtown?
They're setting up a hotel?
I want you
to be my best man.
If you think that I'm gonna
stand at the altar
and lose Mary Houston
to the likes of you...
- Well, hell yes!
- Come on, Eugene!
-
- Sid: Hey, come on!
Right here is
fine, Sid.
Are you sure
this is good?
Yup.
See you later.
Welcome home, Eugene.
Oh!
Hand me your plate
right there, will you?
- Mary: Yes, give him a big slice.
- A nice big slice.
Edward:
How many would you like?
Thank you.
Honey, would you
like some corn?
- Yes, thank you.
- I'll get you some corn.
I can help you set.
Eat up, sweetheart.
Now are you sure
you don't want anymore?
- Dr. Sledge: We should have a little toast.
- Oh, that's lovely, yes.
To Edward's new wife
and the boys being home.
Here's a little souvenir that I brought
back from Prague.
- My lord.
- Edward, it's extraordinary.
Edward: It was floating along
the ground in this forest
that me and my buddy
Jack were sitting in.
I ran over
and I picked it up...
Stop! No!
Edward: I didn't get any sleep
for the longest time.
I still can't,
really.
I toss and turn
like crazy.
Martha doesn't complain,
but I know I keep
waking her up.
Give me your coffee.
I like Martha.
You're a lucky man.
You'll be married...
someday.
And just how did my little brother
do during his time in the service?
There weren't any women
in my corner of the Pacific.
Only nurses
and they were off-limits.
Jesus H. You went
through the entire war
and retained
your virginity?
Well, your lonely nights
are numbered, Gene.
Every single girl in Mobile is out
to land a fighting man.
At the OOM Ball,
you'll have a leg up
on all those desk pilots.
Who says I want
a leg up on anybody?
You show up at that ball decked out
in your uniform
and all the ripe fruit will fall off the tree
right at your feet.
You know, Edward,
I don't believe I will.
You're gonna pass
on the OOM Ball?
No. I don't believe
I will ever put on a uniform again.
Ever.
Not a lick
of sense in you.
-
- Registration?
Man: That's right,
'cause if you don't do it,
they're gonna make
you get back in line again.
Service number right here.
If you could just
head up back there,
that'd be great.
Thank you.
You're looking to register
for classes, Mr. Sledge?
- I'm thinking about it.
- Good choice.
Alabama Polytechnic
is the best.
Which branch did
you serve in?
I was
in the Marine Corps, miss.
"U.S.M.C."
And did you attend any special schools
while in the Marine Corps?
Just boot camp.
Weapons school.
I was
in a mortar squad.
Okay. Did you
do any accounting?
No, miss.
Any journalism?
None at all.
Any engineering,
technical skills?
I had to handle
explosives.
Okay.
Isn't there anything
the Marine Corps taught you
that you can continue
at 'Bama Poly?
They taught me
how to kill Japs.
I got pretty
damn good at it.
-
-
- Oh, I just love this song.
- I know.
Uh, excuse me.
Sid:
I saw you making a break for it.
I thought you could use
a punch properly spiked.
Thank you.
Drink fast.
If Mary catches us,
she'll have me back inside
dancing all night.
You see that?
That's why
I'm still a bachelor.
I don't dance until Eugene Sledge
wants to dance.
How did all this happen?
I mean look at us, Sid,
sitting here at a dance,
drinking punch.
Not a scratch
on either of us.
I mean what the hell
are we doing here?
And why... why did
I end up back here
when all those
other fellas didn't?
I thought that.
Every guy back
has thought that.
But you've just got to pull yourself out
of bed in the morning
and get on with the day.
You do that
enough times in a row,
you forget some things.
For a while, anyway.
- Sidney Phillips.
- Yeah.
Will you get back in here and dance
with the woman who loves you?
I'm coming, boss lady.
Why don't you come on in?
I'll wrangle you a partner.
No.
-
-
Look at these televisions.
There isn't
but two hours of programs
and they're asking
$300 a set.
Sounds like
the future to me.
I'm gonna run down
to Murphy's and buy one
as soon as I have
the money for a down payment.
On a reporter's salary?
John: And how about
this railroad strike?
It's crippled traffic
across the country.
Marion:
Room on the table, please.
- Well, how do they work?
- Is that creamed spinach?
The waves are
collected by a receiver,
shot through an electron gun
onto a vacuum screen.
Always with the answers.
It's called
a cathode ray tube.
- Man: Those things heat up, you know...
- Thank you.
...catch on fire.
- John: So you think you're going down
to Murphy's to get
yourself a television set?
Well, there aren't any.
Nothing's being delivered.
Why creamed spinach?
Man #2: I think the army should
take over the railroads.
That'll teach 'em.
Right, Bob?
You know they transmit from the top
of the Empire State Building?
I bet in five years
everyone's gonna want one.
Steel workers and electrical workers
are also on strike.
Who's next?
We just won the war
and now they're
holding us hostage.
We didn't fight for a bunch
of greedy strikers.
What did we fight for? I thought it was
to beat the Japs and the Nazis.
I'm just saying the country
won't survive these strikes.
Too bad we didn't lose the war.
Then the Japs would
have all these problems.
- Very funny.
- Man: Bob, we all appreciate
the sacrifice you made
on our account.
You know what
I fought for?
Television.
Foddy, ask the blessings,
please.
Our Father
Who art in heaven,
hallowed be Thy name.
Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done
on earth
as it is in heaven.
Give us this day
our daily bread
and forgive us
our trespasses
as we forgive those
that trespass against us.
Lead us not
into temptation
but deliver us
from evil.
- Amen.
- Amen.
- Leckie: Amen.
- Amen.
Amen.
I thought we'd start at what's left of that
old fence down by the creek.
I've been looking forward
to this morning for a long time.
Just the two of us
and a grand morning.
Eugene?
I'm sorry.
I can't.
It's all right.
You don't have to
apologize to me, Eugene.
I reckon the dove population is gonna be
mighty happy this morning.
Honestly, Eugene,
you look like a gangster
with those glasses on.
Your brother's coming
for supper this evening.
Evidently, he's been named
some kind of supervisor at the bank.
Better get our money
out of that bank.
I'm sure Edward
could arrange
a starting
position for you
at the bank.
I'm never going to work
in a bank, Mother.
Well, you need to make
a plan for the future.
My plan is to do
nothing for a while.
How long is
"a while," Eugene?
Leave him alone,
Mary Frank.
The boy is idle, Edward.
- He is not a boy.
- Well, he's acting like one.
Mary Frank,
you have no idea
what men like him
have been through.
Now go on.
Let him be.
