"New York 201 5"
Jimmy-
What time is it?
The farewell party doesn't matter?
Here I am
I can only stay for 30 minutes
I 'm taking the 1 0:30 plane
What's the hurry for your first job?
Aren't we all waiting for this?
From now on
Jimmy Will be a Silicon Valley bigshot
I majored in IT, too
I'm going out West, Iike you are
You two are together now?
Cheers
"Kill the Tiger in the Mountain"
What the...
Very funny guys, way to go
What's that?
Peking Opera
That's your hometown, Jimmy
"X on Fire"
Man, what time is your flight?
I don't think you can make it
It's a massive traffic jam
Well, Merry Christmas
"Kill the Tiger in the Mountain"
"Northeast China 1 946"
One year after the Japanese surrendered
China fell into a full-scale civil war
In the Northeast,
bandits went on a post-war rampage
They killed, looted... and expanded quickly
The common folk suffered, oppressed and afraid
That winter,
a PLA troop captain, code-named 203
Ied a squas to subdue the bandits
at Peony River
awaiting orders from headquarters
The end of the year-
winds roaring, paths blocked
After all kinds of hardships
the squad returned to their homeland
the snowfield forest
Mealtime
So watery?
That's all we have
Captain
En route to camp
the villagers killed by the bandits
numbered to...
Say it
At Nan Hill: 250
Gupai Village: 90
- Yangjia Creek: 120
- Tell me the total number
Give a report with the details
Total number: 603
And
we passed Guying Village without entering
Not sure about their situation
Reporting to 203
Enemies at the machine storehouse
Let's go
A dozen men outside the storehouse
wearing our military uniforms
But they don't look like our men
Not sure about conditions inside
Sir-
the smell of barbecued meat
A big load
enough for more than a dozen people
Report on the bullets
Qu has 52
Tank and Brick have 120
Baojun and Iron Pillar each have 6
It's from Tank
They've discovered us
Thoss men out there
don't fool around
Don't you bump into somebosy
without knowing it's your bro
We're from the Tiger Muuntain
Pick a name
From which gang?
How many of you?
So you're Lord Hawk's gang
He's a bandit under Hawk
This land belongs to Hawk now
Damn it
Scared me
Stop pretending
No bullshit, you're alone?.
What's your name?
Wang
What do you do?.
I've found Iots of goodies
Sirs, come take a look
Which gang are you from?.
I don't belong to any
I'm just a hunter
A hunter
And what have you hunted?
Right... what have you got?
A lut of goodies
I can't carry them all alone
That many?.
Sirs, if you like, be my guest
He's not alone
The grenades collided!
Tank
They have tanks
Stop throwing grenades, Iet's split
Baojun
Shit, two fled
Son of a gun
They're in our uniforms
easily mistaken as our men by the villagers
The enemy poses as us
and smears our name
Before arriving at Peony River
we've entered Hawk's territory
There's thousands of men
- Way outnumbered
- Reporting to 203
We've seized Ioads of bandit ammunition
- Is everyone okay?
- Okay
Is this edible?
Some kind of delicacy?
Barbecued rat
Tank
Not bad
Really?. Excellent
Hong
How much food is left?.
None
Tonight there's nothing to cook
Attention, please-
We will soon arrive at Harbin West Station
If you are to disembark here
please get ready
The next station is Harbin West Station
If you are to disembark here
please get ready
- Hello
- Hi
Jimmy
I Heard you were home
I need something from there
Why not use a courier?
You'll be fired by your company
No, I've notified them
Are you home for your girlfriend?
No
Tank
Our people
Where are you from?
Stonegate Village
There's one more
Yang
This is Comrase Yang
We were comrades in arms before
Yang, this is Captain 203
Reporting to 203
Yang, Political Division scout
Hejiang Military District
reporting for duty
The snowstorm was too heavy
but we found a train
Transfer order
This is field hospital nurse
Comrade Bai
Bai reports to the Captain
Telegraph HQ to verify
Yes
I've also brought food for you
- Food?
- There
Bravo!
Open the gate
Here comes Lord Hawk
Lower the palanquin
Without my order
how dare you go downhill?.
and only you two dogs return
We were ambushes by the PLA
And they had tanks
They had tanks
Lord Hawk
Lord Hawk
I smell something funny
One Word:
Not Honest
Lord Hawk, those are two words
Shut up
Big brother
Take a few msn downhill
and see if there's any PLA
Yes, Lord Hawk
As for you two-
Go peck them!.
Bro 7
how does one become Lord Hawk?
You can't
Above all the bandits in the world
The Hawk is unparalleled
Comrade Bai
Ever shot a gun befure?.
What do you mean, a match?
No, just asking
Why's your frostbite bandaged Iike this?.
- Who did it?.
- 203
He bandaged all our feet
This Yang doesn't behave like a scout
So sloppy
How can he fight playing like this?.
Reporting to 203
HQ has replied
Saying what?.
Yang knows the area,
is an experiences investigator
Bai, the nurse
has been trained in battlefield rescue
Now, the area is grim and complicated
The two are sent to help
If there's a problem,
solve it yourself
Yang
Sing one more
What is it?.
- See anything?
- No
I've got you, get out!
- A child
- A child?.
From the village?
Bring him back
The wound is inflamed
- It's very serious
- Gunshot
- Anaesthetic?.
- Serious shortags
No
Little brother, be strong
Don't struggle
Hold on-
It's almost done, hold on
It's wrapped, Iet him go
Eat something
- Tank
- Tank
What are you doing?
He'll freeze if he runs out
This boy thinks we're bandits
Lord Hawk grabbed this secret arsenal
from the Japanese
Nobody knows how much
ammunition the Tiger Fortress has
I tell you, Commissioner Hou
They have 3,000 guns
Lord Hawk
KMT ans the PLA are fighting
KMT wants to incorporate us
We've opened quite a can of worms
Bro 3 fought PLA with the Japs
Among all the bandits in the nine mountains
only he knows how to operate
this iron tortoise
Commissioner Hou, with this thing
is the other ringleader, Big Stick
even qualified to be No. 1?.
Commissioner Hou,
you represent the government to bestow
the commander of the Northeast advance troop
I can say this-
other than Lord Hawk,
nobody dares to take the position
Let's be frank-
If your gang submits to us
your respectable Hawk
will surely be the Commander of the advance troop
As for the Advance Map,
I will, of courss, offer it to him
Well sais
Lord Hawk, you will be the Commander
That depends on whether Hou
wants to give us the Advance Map
What map?.
Advance Map
One Word:
Getting the Map depends on whether
our force is strong enough
Hawk
seems to have a powerful army
But isn't a candidate for the Advance Map
Commissioner Hou, what do you mean?
The Hawk is bent on
becoming the biggest warlord in the Northeast
If he gets the Map,
he'Il be a major concern
So the Commissioner means...
The Advance Map
should be given to Big Stick
Smart boy
Let the two gangs fight each other,
and we'll gathsr the spoils
Yesterday we ambushed the Tiger gang
Hawk must be infuriated
If a large contingent of troops comes
villagers will be hurt when the fighting starts
The next stop is Leather Creek
Before the bandits come downhill
we must settle the villagers
Hongyi and Tank are locals
They will enter Leather Creek
as village people and check out the situation
Bring Yang
and also... that...
- that...
- Lil' Dove
Lil' Dove?.
We all call her that
Comrade Bai
They don't look like soldiers
If they go, it's easier to hide our identity
Stop knocking
Nobody's inside
No food, just my life
Take it if you can
Nothing left
Give them anything
Mother
Mother
Auntie
Fsllow villager-
Don't be afraid
we are not bandits
Yongqi, It's me
Tank and I are back
- Hongyi
- Yongqi
Tank
give me a hand
help the old lady lie down
- Mother
- Let me see
She is a health officer
the same as a doctor
The lass is a doctor
Yongqi
What happened to my aunt?
It's my fault
Couldn't find food for her
Come
Auntie
Yongqi
What happened in Leather Creek?
What happened?
After the Japs surrendered,
the bandits kept coming to loot our village
We fought them
with fewer and fewer men
They took all our food
How can we go on?
Your brother and sister-in-Iaw
and Tank's family
were also...
My boy
In the village
there are bandit spies
Who?
Couldn't find out
Reporting to 203
at your order, our men
are in villager clothes
to disguise our identity
Reporting to HQ
our troop stations at Leather Creek
the bandits are coming
Gao
Notify all troops: urgent assembly
Leather Creek's consition is unclear
We should hide ourselves
Protect the villagers in secret
Don't let the enemy discover us
Yes
Big brother, no sign of anything
No tank tracks, either
- Our spies?
- Yes, in the village
Tell them to report on any activity
Go back
Yes
North of the logging area are two huts
The slope behind the Creek
is susceptible to bandit attack
They are numerous
We need a defense line to fight against them
Ever heard of the indigenous cannons
made by the armored troop?
The Flying Thunder?. I know it
Put gunpowder in gasoline barrels
It's particularly powerful
Chaojia, you take Baojun and some soldiers
to look for gasoline barrels
Install them at crucial points in the village
Remember, this is our heavy weapon
Get ready for a fight
Yes
This is good stuff
Hard for me to find
Can't eat with your hands tied?
I can untie you, but
don't hit people again
- He fled
- Come back
Shut up
You hear me?. Shut up
Freeze or I'll shoot you
Shut up
Lord Hawk sends you to monitor the PLA here
- There is no PLA
- That's right
He even asks me to look for tanks
Aide Luan
You left with Commissioner Hou
Why return to see Lord Hawk?.
I Have a map
Advance Map
Commissioner asked me to give it to Big Stick
But I'm just a messenger-
with nothing to gain
If I give it to Lord Hawk,
Not only do I get money,
but also a high position in the gang
- Agree?
- Yes
Brat! How dare you bite me?
I'll roast you!
Regiment 2, Detachment 2, PLA Private
Gao-
Tell me
Why are the PLA here?
How many of you?
Brat
So tight-lipped
All right, you'Il need some sweetener
Speak
No word and this Ieg will break
Thess ribs can be so tender
One struke will break several
Don't shoot, we can talk
Rest assured
What you heard in the hut
I've reported to 203
I'm tying up the splint
- Lil' Dove
- Be brave, act like a soldier
How do you feel?
- 203
- Don't move
Lie down
Reporting to 203
Ready to fight anytime
You eat, I eat
All right
You two each have a half
Tell me, what is your name?.
Where is your home?.
Knotti
It's okay
Knotti's Iast name is Jiang
He lived at Shalan Village
Six months ago, bandits killed his father
his mother Qinglian went missing
Knotti drifted about alonc, looking for relatives
He bore lots of hardships
His mother must've been abducted by the bandits
I hope she's still alive
so they can reunite
It's sweet sorghum, the house is full of it
So much food
Hongyi, now our village
has food for the winter
Hoarding so much food and ammunition
this must belong to the bandits'
connecting point in Leather Creek
I can't see through Yang
What is he doing here?
HQ must've ssnt him for a reason
Let's wait and see
Sir
I just scalp tobacco for food
A mere trifle
For a trifle you beat people up like that?
You goddamn liar
I thought he was a thief
Ever heard of Advance Map?.
No
Gao said
this guy wants to sell the Advance Map to Hawk
We must find the map
He'll confess if we beat it out of him
- This is for Gao
- Don't be impetuous
We need intelligence from him
Let me try
Aide Luan
You betrayed Commissioner Hou
He sent you to deliver something to Big Stick
and you turn to Hawk
Two gangs and Commissioner Hou
all in your pocket
Would Big Stick be cheated by a bastard like you?
Listen-
he also conned KMT and PLA
Big Stick joined PLA?.
You're confusing me
You can't fool anyone
Listen, he has words for you
You've got the Map, but going nowhere
Hawk can't get it either
He also ordered
a grave for you at Leather Creek
Brother
your name?.
Call me...
Hu
This Yang, who is he?
He's Yang from Shandong
Mr. Hu
I'm Luan
Cut the crap
I've conveyed the message
Now I'll send you to hell
Wait, Mr. Hu
do ms a favor, please tell Lord Big Stick
the map is with me now
I'll always have it
I won't go to Hawk
It's a misunderstanding
It's such a big favor, how do I not do it?
I'll spare your Iife now
Let's wait and see
Advance Map
Report to HQ now
- Yes
- Go
Wait
There's one more scoop
Fsllow villagers-
Leather Creek wasn't afraid of the Japs,
why would it fear bandits?
As long as we raise our guns
the bandits dare not come
There's no way to fight them
Any village that fought the bandits
was wiped out
We can't fight the bandits
Why not?
Village chief
this hard-earnes harvest can't be
surrendered to the bandits for nothing
Mr. Soldier, after you leave
Leather Creek will again suffer a calamity
Hide those things right away
I beg you
I'll kneel before you
Spare our lives
We can't fight the bandits
Give me a gun
Give me a gun
- Give me a gun
- Kiddie-
- you"'re shorter than the gun
- Give me gun
- Stop shouting
- Give it to me
Give me gun, l'Il avenge
- my dad's death on the bandits
- Let go
Revenge is an adult business
You're still a kid
You just stay quietly at home
I Have no home
You have a home
All of us are your family
So when we go fight the bandits
you take care of the home
We surely will
find your mom for you
Report, HQ knows about the Advance Map
The Advance Map shows the distribution of
over 1 0,000 advance soldiers in the Northeast
Advance troops were the armed forces hiding
in the mountains during the war against Japan
The Japs drew 3 military maps
based on intelligence
The Japs deployed troops
in a futile attempt to control them
After the Japs surrendered,
their forces remained in the mountains
Each went their own way
Whoever gets the three maps now
can summon the advance troops
and become king of the Northeast
The first one is a Coordinate Map
The nine mountains, 18 mounds
outposts, contact points, and courdinates
are all Iaid out on this map
This Coordinate Map
is in the hands of our Lord Hawk
The second one is an Ammunition Map
When warlord Zhang was king of the Northeast
deep in the mountains and forests
he built two arsenals
storing uver 10,000 guns,
hundreds of cannons and countless ammunition
One of these two arsenals
is at Tiger Mountain
It was later taken by the Japs
And is now in Hawk's hands
Who would've thought there's an arsenal
What's the third map?
This third map is Warlord Zhang's...
Warlord Zhang's Treasure Map
- Lord Hawk
- Lord Hawk
Legend has it there's 80,000 pounds of gold
Brothers-
with 80,000 pounds of gold
we can buy as much ammunition as we like
from the Japs and the Russians
We can command Peony River
seize the Northeast
Next stop
One Word:
get the Gold Map
Luan surely doesn't know
the value of this map
Otherwise he wouldn't have given it to Hawk
This will cause a fierce bandit battle
I fear the villagers
will suffer another disaster
Strike fast
Annihilate Hawk
then sliminate Big Stick
How do we fight? Tiger Mountain
has over 1,000 men
The war is raging
We're short on men
They can't support us
I Have an idea-
If bandits can impersonate us,
We can send someone to impersonate them
and infiltrate their hideout
He finds the spot with the Ieast firepower,
and that'll be our breakthrough point
When it's time, we'Il coordinate from within
and wipe out Hawk in one blow
How do you gain the bandits' trust?.
As an enemy intelligence scout
I was sent undercover in Big Stick's
gang for a year
I stusied them thoroughly
I want to take on this mission
Captain-
Rejected
Then what is your plan?.
One way: mobilize the villagers
to flee as far as they can
Another way: arm the villagers
and wait for reinforcement
Both are too passive
Moreover, time is running out
The mountains will soon be snowed under
You need to obey orders
All right-
Then I resign
Yang
I knew you'd do this
Okay
it's up to you
Disobey orders
Act with no permission and no discipline
You've approved my resignation
Now I ain't under you
I know you're used to acting alone
But this time is different
A minor mistake
will ruin it all
Think about it
You don't trust me
You can't go to Hawk empty-handed
This is Luan's Advance Map
- The real map?.
- A fake map won't fool Hawk
I made a copy and sent it to HQ
And-
according to Luan's confession
we drew this map of Tiger Mountain
Leggy
Yes
Yang
you are our anti-bandit squad
You must succeed
Don't fail us
Follow Yang into the mountains
- Keep us posted
- Yes
Leggy, let's split here
Okay
Beyond this mountain
is Tiger Gang territory
From here
go downhill a ways
there's Liu Village
You should hide there
When it's time
I'll meet you here
Okay
Yang
Hide your message inside the bark
I'll check it every day
Yang-
be very careful from now on
Leggy
you know why 203 changed his mind?
Perhaps he's decided already
and waiting for your confirmation
Take care
Remember this rock
I'll try my best to approach Hawk
to find out more and inform you ASAP
If you don't hear from me after 1 0 days
the mission may have failed and I've been killed
Remember, the bandits are very cunning
Guard against surprise attacks
Protect the villagers of Leather Creek
Protect Little Knotti
Yang
Who are you?.
Speak of the devil-
Want milk?
Mother comes
Want her relatives?.
Here comes the kid's uncls
Who are you?.
I'm me
Point the gun down
It's uncocked
Carry the tiger, pull the horse
Open the gate
Bring the man in
"A cloud in the black Northwest sky"
"A crow in a flock of phoenix"
"A house filled with heroes"
"Who's the king and who are the fellows?. "
Your name
Last name Hu
Mr. Hu
which gang are you with?.
I belong to Lord Big Stick's gang
Aide Hu, in charge of horses
What's your assignment here?.
I won't say 'til I see the boss
Big brothers-
I just arrived, please bear with me
"Our master Iords over tigsrs"
"Our pagoda seals river monsters"
What do you do?.
I belong to Lord Big Stick's gang
Why do you blush?.
I'm full of vigor
Why is it yellow now?
It's Wax against the cold
That said,
you are under Commander Big Stick
What identity will you fake?
Big Stick has a horse aide called Hu
This man is seldom seen
Nobody recognizes him
I can borrow his identity to meet Hawk
Big Stick and Hawk are arch-enemies
Using this identity is suicidal
Exactly because of this,
Hawk will not verify
Hu, horse aide of Lord Big Stick
pays respect to Lord Hawk
When...
did you know Commander Big Stick?
When he was the Pulice Commissioner
I've heard he has some favorite things
Two treasures
- Which two?.
- Horse and sword
- What horse?.
- A blue-mane horse
- What sword?.
- A Japanese saber
- Who's gift?
- The Japs Army
- Where?.
- At Peony River
Brother Hu-
your commander treatsd you well
Why do you betray him?.
If I am a traitor,
you can kill ms now
It's all Aide Luan's fault
He stole Lord Big Stick's Advance Map
and blamed the theft on me
Lord Hawk, give me some wine first
I eventually caught the guy
I asked him to take the map
and go back with me
Explain everything to Lord Big Stick
to his face
Guess What he said?
He said: going back means death
It'd be better to offer the map to the PLA
We'd be made battalion or regiment commanders
I pretended to agree
After he fell asleep
I stole the map
I plannes to take it back to the brigade
and explain everything to Lord Big Stick
But Luan's remark alarmed me
Going back meant death
In the Peony River region
I most admire you, Lord Hawk
In for a penny, in for a pound
Taking advantage of the snowstorm
I braved Tiger Mountain
hoping to join your gang
Liar
Bullshit
You think I'm a pig?
Making up such a story
I know the rules
No gift, no joining the gang
Lord Hawk
the Advance Map of Peony River
Hu's gift
to Lord Hawk
- Any news about Yang?.
- Not yet
- 203
- I'll take over the shift
You get some rest
Captain
- I'm not hungry
- You drink it
It's just you and me. Stop tagging along
Sister Lil' Dove said this is a mission
If you don't drink, l'Il fail
Sister also said
Captain surely can't sleep afterwards
We even pinky swore
Okay, I'll drink it
Go
Knotti, come here
It's your turn
I'm telling yuu-
move again, and I'll cut you like a mangy dog
Lord Hawk said
to reward Hu
with the 9th Warrior Attendant position
Colonel of Security Brigade
Congratulations to the 9th Chief
Big brother,
Bro 9 can do Northeast dance duet
Stop barking
Can't you see it's your master?
Dogs
They're my pets
My house is next to yours
Come visit me anytime
None of your business
Get out
Lord Hawk's woman
Don't touch
Ma'am, Ieave Bro 9 a life
Get Iost
Bro 7,
you get out too
Bro 9, be careful
Bro 7, Bro 9 is doomed
Lord Hawk
Let's go
Bro 9,
you're srunk
Ma'am,
why are you here?
Don't call me ma'am,
sounds so old
Call me Qinglian
Knotti's Iast name is Jiang
He lived at Shanlan forestry station
His mother Qinglian went missing
Bro 9, son't go
Ma'am, have you been here
for over half a year?
Why rush, Bro 9?
We need to respect seniority
Ma'am,
Iet me pour you some tea,
roll you a cigarette
Bro 9
Who are you?.
How'd you know...
Knotti is fine,
he's taken care of
He misses his mom every day
The boss sends his Iady to see me
Take me to him
It's not the right time
Maybe later
I'm so grateful
I await patronage from the lady
My honor
Bro 9
- Are you all right?
- Thanks for the tip
You saved my life
We're brothers
You're still alive
Brilliant!
You know how many Iives were lost for her?
How did you do it?
Go out for a walk
Bro 9,
the firepower of Tiger Mountain
covers five mounts and nine bunkers
It's an impenetrable defense
Show me, open my eyes
On the upposite side
is the fortune rock
of Tiger Mountain,
the King's rock
A brilliant man once foretold
it symbolizes Lord Hawk's throne
To the north of the King's rock,
there seem to be no defenses in place
On the Eastern cliff there are
open and hidden arms
Isn't the North overlooked?.
It isn't
The Eagle Beak there is like a hanging lamp
Look, Bro 9,
a valley, right in the middle
So what bastards can come up here?.
Only the heavenly soldiers can fly this way
Lord Hawk,
Hu joined us without being tested
It isn't proper
After the Japs retreated,
a 2,000-man troop
was defeated by eight of us
How did we do it?.
Lord Hawk was astute and circumspect
You used spies
Therefore,
I hate spies the most
Bro 9
Stop barking, one of ours
- Where are you going?
- I go pee
Me to
Bro 8, men aren't dogs
We can't treat them like dogs
What's wrong?
I treet them well
They're fed every day
They actually enjoy it
We can't live by bullying others
We have to be refined
Should hope for peaceful life
Peaceful life?.
What is peaceful life?.
Brothers, fight the PLA!
Fight the PLA!
Damn it, the PLA is here
Bro 9, grab your gun and kill the PLA
Go
Damn,
at least there's a company
Bro 9, Iook
Shit, aim precisely
What kind of marksmanship is that?.
Blind?.
Bro 9, have some fun
He dares not shoot
Son of a bitch
Bro 9
Brothers,
fight hard and kill the PLA!
Bro 9 is brilliant
Keep an eye on him
Bro 2
Stop
Bro 9,
stop at unce!.
Stop firing
Son of a bitch
Stop firing
Stop
Bro 9, this is a drill
Drill
They're our brothers
Our brothers
Damn you
Are you kidding me?
A drill?.
Killing so many
Bro 2
The men are here...
you might as well give them to me
I'II take them downhill
to practice looting
Lord Hawk, What do you think?
Tell Bro 5,
if Hu plays a trick on us,
bring back his corpse
Sure thing
- Bro 5, you lead the way
- Okay
Brothers,
follow my orders
We go downhill, we start Iooting
This is a rotten idea of testing Hu
At least it proves Hu
isn't a PLA spy
One Word:
Why weren't you down there, being blown up too?.
Brothers,
Iet's race to the oppusite slope
No. 1 gets $5
No. 2 gets $3
No. 3 gets $1
Charge!
Bro 8,
I remember
there was a grove
When was it cut down?.
Really?.
Maybe it's for the winter
Before the snow'll seal off the mountain,
we must gather enough firewood
Lord Hawk forbids the felling of trees uphill
So our brothers must have chopped these down
Clever, it's a shortcut
Son of a bitch
My belly aches
You wait here
I'll find a place
Mine aches, too
You wait here, I'll go as well
What do you want?
Let's follow
I'd say...
watching me crap?.
That's new!.
You got shit in there?.
Then take a crap
No shit?. Don't crap
And don't watch
I'm talking to you
Idiots
- Shit!
- Take a hike!.
- Ignore him
- I can't crap with you here
Never had to crap with live gunfire
Bro 5, is there a trick to it?.
You wanna kill Bro 8, too?
He's taking a crap, too
Bro 8,
brought any paper?.
Just pick it out
I'm not used to thet
Forget it, I'll handle it myself
What are you two up to?
Interested in your dad's butt?.
Like to watch?.
Don't you ever crap again
Once you do it,
I'II shoot your butts
Stop nagging
- One more word I'll geld you
- What!.
Nonsense
Godsamn enjoyable
They're after my butt
Who's after your butt?
You son of a bitch
No respect for your elders
We're all brothers
Let's go
Yang suggests that
we go up Tiger Mountain's north cliff
and sneak attack the Tiger Fortress
On the map,
the north side of Tiger Fortress
faces Eagle Beak
Who's been to Eagle Beak?.
I've heard of it, but never been there
I've been there. I'll Iead the way
You've been to Eagle Beak?
My dad used to take me
I know how to get there
But it's all precipices, can we manage?.
If Yang suggests it,
he knows
I can go up there
Knotti, let's go
and prepare the skis
- You know how to ski?.
- Who doesn't?
Okay
Go
Chaojia, you take five men
and scout with Knotti at Eagle Beak
Yes
Knotti's mother Qinglian
is on Tiger Mountain and she's fine
Don't tell Knotti
Remember, we can't Iet him know
Knotti, follow me
- Don't lag behind
- Try to catch up
Little Knotti,
come closer and don't get lost
Closer
Knotti, slow down
Catch up with him
Don't lose him
That's something, Knotti
You ski really fast
We should be your apprentices
What does that mean?.
Learn skiing from you
No problem, that's easy
There's Eagle Beak
Let's split up and check it out
Go
Yang says upposite to Eagle Beak is
the Northern cliff of Tiger Mountain
But the cliff is too steep
What?
You bragged that
nothing could stop you
You're cowering now?.
I Have an idea
You sing well, Lors Hawk
Where is Knotti?.
Take me to him
Listen to me
I found this in Hawk's coat
This is Tiger Mountain's map of secret paths
We can escape with it
If Hawk discovers it,
no one can escape
Listen,
put the map back immediately
You should know
Tiger Mountain isn't a place you can escape from
Run now
Before he discovers it, we'll be gone
Can't leave now
If you're not taking me away,
why did you mention Knotti?
Who are you?.
You drank too much
I'm just Bro 9 of Tiger Mountain
Cut the crap
If I die,
you can't shirk the responsibility
You two...
what responsibility?.
As Bro 9,
you should tell if you're leaving
Get out with your hands up
Later, insist the map is on him
Stand still
Use your left hand
to give me your gun
Who shot?.
Lord Hawk, it's me
I saw your lady trying to elope with Bro 9
So I fired to alert you
Really?.
Lord Hawk,
My conscience is clear
Hang him up
Tie him up
Later, insist that the map is on him
It's him
I saw him steal from Lord Hawk's house
I asked Bro 9 to help me catch him
Now he's faking a counter-charge
A thief accusing thieves
You...
Lord Hawk
I didn't, I swear I didn't
Confess
Lord Hawk, I really didn't
I kept an eye on your wife
to see if she'd be disloyal to you
That's very kind of you
Lord Hawk, this is a misunderstanding
Is he a thief, or not?
Search him and fins out
Lord Hawk, if I've done anything wrong,
I'll shoot myself
Search
This...
This really... isn't mine
Use your left hand, and give me your gun
Lord Hawk, it really isn't mine
- I'm being framed
- Of course it isn't yours
It's mine
Lord Hawk, I'm being framed
Big brother,
you brought him here
Tell me...
what should be done?.
Big brother
Don't, Big brother
Lord Hawk
See you in the next Iife
Whoops
Missed the target
Lord Hawk,
I'm Bro 4's guarantor
I should be punished
No
Forget it
Now you owe me your life
You can pay me back later
Lord Hawk
Lord Hawk
Thank you, Lord Hawk
Lord Hawk
How about Bro 9?.
- What's that?.
- Again
What's that?
- Come on
- Don't move
- Grab the tile
- Don't blame it on me
- It's all your fault
- My fault?.
I haven't won all night
What tile did you give out?.
My turn
I win, Royal Flush, 148 points
- Pay up, everybosy pay up
- AIl the same suit
- Pay up
- Paying
- Lend me some money
- No
Bro 6, no way
Bro 6, no way
You bastard, listen up
Loaning money to me is an honor, get it?.
Can't pay your Iosses?.
Then don't play
It's enough
The village spies've been silent
Lord Hawk
Big brother,
the spies you sent
are either Iiving in peace
or were killed by the PLA
Tomorrow, take Bro 5, Bro 6
and 300 men downhill
If PLA is really down there,
treat it as an exercise
Before the snow seals off the mountain,
kill the sheep and come back for New Year
Yes, Lord Hawk
The bandits are coming
The bandits are coming
How many of them? How far away?.
Over 200 men
About 2 miles from the village
Tank
Order all the units to get ready for combat
- Set up three defense lines
- Yes
- Detonator
- Yes
How about the FIying Thunder?.
Can detonate at any time
Gao, tell Yongqi
to gather the villagers
- Keep a close eye on Luan
- Yes
Listen carefully,
move around when you fight,
so that the enemy can't figure out our numbers
Buddha of infinite light, please bless us
Quit your racket
No use praying
If you attract the bandits here,
we'll all die
Little Knotti, don't be afraid
We hid in a hut like this last time
They all died
Everybody died
I don't wanna die
- I wanna gu home
- Don't make a noise
Don't worry, this time is different
This time, we're here
Fire
Fire
Damn it,
they have cannons
Must be PLA's primary force
Follow me
Shut up
you bastard
You won't be rescued
Stop dreaming
Shut up
Charge
Little Knotti, it's okay
Knotti
Knotti
Little Knotti
Leggy
Leave the roof now
Damn it
Damn it
Big brother
Someone's firing from the tower
- Load the gun
- Yes
Let me through
Knotti
Stay here
Knotti's gone out, let me out
Okay
Be careful
Get ready
Wait
Who's there 1 00 feet ahead?.
They're in firing range
The village chief
Go away
Go
- Hongyi
- Yes
The west side has fallen
You must hold on
Yes
Knotti
No more in the cartridge, go get it
Yes
Little Knotti
Stay here, don't move
Hold on
Give the bullets to Tank
Give the bullets to Tank
Knotti
Brick
Brick
Brick
He said to give Tank the bullets
Knotti
Knotti
Ready for a match?
I'll go distract them
Don't move or I'll shuot you
Knotti
Ammunition box
Bro 6
Big brother
Bro 6
Where is Bro 5?
Haven't seen him
Guess he's fled
Don't hesitate, Big brother
Iet's withdraw
Withdraw
Brick...
The others?.
Auger, Xiaoliang
Wheel and Steel Wrist
are all injured
And...
Captain
It's all my fault
I'm useless
I Iet that bastard Luan
slip away
Leggy, let's chase
Chase Who?
Luan
If we can't find Luan
Yang will be in danger
Bro 9, Iook
your ols pal is here
Aren't you Brother Luan?
When did you come to Tiger Mountain?
It's you?.
It's me
Hu
What's going on, brother?
Last month we're at Leather Creek
trying to decide which gang to join
You dragged me to the PLA
Only a short while later
you're wearing the PLA uniform
Are you a regiment or battalion commander now?
Hu
You've all been duped
Lord Hawk
he's a PLA spy
Bullshit
You say our Bro 9
is a PLA spy
Brother Luan
that's a vicious thing to say
You calles me a PLA spy
Don't forget, it was you who asked me to join
Now you're giving me this shitty unfair label
Wanna Iend Lord Hawk a knife to kill me
- You're lying
- Did the PLA send you?.
Lord Hawk and all big brothers
Let this bastard explain
how he knows I'm a PLA spy
and how he he's so familiar with the PLA
You killed my brother at Leather Creek
You stole my things
Lord Hawk, the fur coat he's wearing
was originally my gift for you
Luan
if you were captured by the PLA,
How'd you get back here so quickly?.
Why are you wearing a PLA uniform?.
Did the goddamned PLA send you to Tiger Mountain?
I'm wearing this to evade
the PLA spies
Lord Hawk
How many PLA solsiers are down there?
Bullshit
When did Leather Creek get cannons?.
Lord Hawk
I think the PLA at least have
a regiment down there
How else could they kill so many?
Lord Hawk, they really only have 30
That means only
were able to reduce 300 of our men
to fewer than 50
And killed Bro 5, too
Bullshit
Luan, it's damn strange that you're suddenly here
Tell me why or I'll shoot you
Say it
Big brothers-
Today
Today, every word I say is true
I swear to god
Lord Hawk
Lord Hawk
To offer tributs, I offended this mad dog
If I don't have my revenge, I'm less than a man
Today, at Tiger Mountain
either he lives or I live
If I'm a PLA spy
you can kill ms right now
Whether I'm an outsider or your man
you decide
Lord Hawk
there's no problem with Bro 9
He really is PLA
I did run away from Leather Creek, Lord Hawk
Whether he's Iying or not
I know the answer
Today you come to join our gang
you must have a gift
Lord Hawk, everything
has stolen by the PLA
Did he snatch this?.
Lord...
Lord Hawk
This map, Lord Hawk
he took it from me
It's him
What a mess
It's getting more confusing
Who do I listen to?
I'd rather Ieave it to you
Lord Hawk
don't shoot, Lord Hawk
I know you don't believe me
But if you go check out Leather Creek
you'll know it's a PLA trap
Big brother, it seems you have to go again
Damn you
I just got ambushed at Leather Creek
You ask me to go again
You want all my brothers killed?.
Don't hit
Lord... Lord Hawk
Truly, there's only 30 PLA soldiers
Kill him!
I know Leather Creek well
Now, while they're still recuperating,
I'll take you to wipe them out
Bro 9
Your gun, your mission
Lord Hawk, entrust it to me
Every word I say is true
And you wanna kill me
I've Iied all my life
Speak to a saint like a saint,
a devil like a devil
I've been safe and gained wealth
I didn't expect the first time I tell the truth
I'd die in the hands of a liar
No use saying that now
Let's go, Bro 2
Luan is killed by Yang
On New Year's Eve
A banquet will be held at Tiger Hall
At 1 a.m.
I'II blow up the west wall to welcome you
Gao
Brick
you two stay at Leather Creek
Salute the two
comrades in arms
I know you don't want me to go with you
You've never treated me as a soldier
No
you've taken good care of the warriors
They're grateful to you
But for the Tiger Mountain battle
- in case we...
- And you're the soldier?.
What's the duty of a soldier?
To protect himself?.
Liars
My mom and dad are dead
Brother Gao died
Which of you protected thsm?.
I'm telling yuu, Gao died protecting us
What you're saying isn't fair
Your mom and dad sacrificed for you
Have you gone crazy?
- Get up
- Get up for what?.
Knotti
Listen to me, your mom is still alive
Yang sent word
your mom is on Tiger Mountain
Knotti
she's still alive, do you hear me?.
She's still alive
Understand?.
Still alive...
Tank
the villagers want to see the Captain
Captain
The villagers heard that
you're attacking Tiger Mountain tonight
Today is Lunar New Year's Eve
They want to treat all of you
to a New Year's Eve family dinner
A snowstorm is coming
We have to arrive at Eagle Beak before dark
Every minute counts
We'll have family dinner when we return
Fsllow villagers-
thank you
- Get ready to set off
- Yes
Don't go, I'll go so I can find my mom
Lil' Juan
what are you doing?. Come here
Knotti
At Tiger Mountain, you can only wait outside
- This is an order
- Okay
Lil' Dove, Knotti is entrusted to you
Light the lanterns
"Boundless longevity"
Here enters the birthday star, the invincible
Lord Hawk
Would the birthday star take his seat
The birthday banquet begins now
Serve the food and wine
Lord Hawk
Elders and brothers-
today is the 60th birthday
of our Lord Hawk
and also New Year's Eve
A double blessing has descendes upon us
A family of 1,000 members, ruled by one man
Our gang is large and prosperous
thanks to boss' leadership
Come, raise your glasses
Let's all wish our boss
a happy birthday
and many more to come
Bottoms up
Get out of the way
Lord Hawk
Some of our brothers
saw the lady run towards
the Northwest corner on a horse
We've brought her back
Grab your guns, quick
What?
What?
Charge
Get out of the way, quick
Lord Hawk, the arsenal's been robbed
We're under siege
Hawk
retribution comes to all, eventually
Catch the traitor
This traitor must've come from outside
Hands up
You're the only outsider here
They're my brothers in arms
I suspected one day
Tiger Mountain would be infiltrated
But before you succeed
my role to play
is to kill you
Big brother
I spared your life
today you should repay me
Shield me when I flee
Yes, Lord Hawk
Hawk has fles
Disarm and surrender
Freeze
Stop resisting
Disarm and we Won't kill you
Hands up
We're the PLA
Drop your weapons and we won't kill you
Bro 9
Put down your guns
- Put down your guns
- Don't
Baojun, ignore me
I'II say it once more
put down your guns
- 203
- Baojun
ignors me
I'II count to three
Put down your guns or I'll shoot him
Bro 9
Bro 9
Mom
Knotti
Mom
It's over
I hope Knotti's generation
won't see war again
Right
you asked to resign
HQ does not object
because I've never reported to them
It seems you and the squad
will take on ths next mission
This is an order
Yes, Captain
- Grandma
- My boy
- Eat the fish
- Smells good
Haven't tasted Grandma's fish in so long
Eat more
Why are there so many guests?
What guests?
They are all our family
It's the New Year, we're having family dinner
As we do every year
Lad, you've grown up
Grandpa
You haven't been home in years
Sit down, sit down
Goos timing! We can have family dinner
together on New Year's Eve
Dig in
Oh, and-
when I was little, grandpa said
Tiger Mountain had a hidden airstrip
If I'm to imagine
Yang's saving grandma
it might have been like that
You son of a bitch
Who the hell are you?.
Put down your gun
One Word:
I assure your life
I assure your death
One Word:
I won't say one word
