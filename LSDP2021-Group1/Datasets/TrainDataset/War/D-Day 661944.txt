The hour of our greatest
effort and action is approaching.
We march with valiant allies
who count on us as we count on them.
And when the signal is given,
a whole circle of avenging nations
will hurl themselves upon the foe.
This mission is dangerous, but it's crucial.
You know what? I'm feeling lucky.
"Shoot them before they shoot you."
That's what my dad said before I left.
Collins, meet England.
- England, meet Collins.
- This is where Bob Hope's from.
What are you talking about, Collins?
Bob Hope's an American.
No, I read it. He was born in England.
I'm gonna knock you out
if you don't stop winding me up!
Bob Hope!
Goddamn reporters!
How am I supposed to get the job done
when we've got those bloodhounds
snooping around the whole time?
Perhaps you'll just have
to learn to enjoy their company.
Gentlemen, Berlin will expect us to take
the shortest crossing from Dover to Calais,
where their defenses are strongest.
We will surprise them
by taking the long crossing to Normandy.
We will land five divisions, establish a bridgehead
and drive inland as far as possible.
A vicious counter-offensive
from the enemy will come on that day.
We will repel it.
This is our chance. We must seize it.
We have six months to prepare.
Temporary accommodation for US troops...
Landing craft on the Thames Estuary,
And tanks in the south of England...
"Operation Fortitude."
The plan to invade France is well under way -
a good plan, but with one great risk attached.
The enemy will be expecting it.
The fact is, you can't hide an invading army.
But you can obscure its objectives.
We must convince the enemy
that "Overlord" is not the invasion
but a diversion from the main assault
which will take place elsewhere at a later date.
We will spin two webs of deceit.
The first that there is an army in Scotland
preparing to invade Norway.
The second that there is an army in the south
preparing to invade Pas-de-Calais.
Which is, of course,
where they are expecting the invasion.
Between now and D-Day, our double agents
will feed the enemy a rich diet of lies,
washed down with a few harmless truths
for the sake of credibility.
The question is, which double agents do we use?
"England must be destroyed and dominated.
"With a raised arm I end this letter
"with a pious remembrance for all our dead."
Berlin will be delighted
with their new recruits in Swansea.
Who will be the brothers
in the Aryan World Order?
I was thinking of creating a retired sailor,
a few salesmen, a WREN, perhaps.
And how's your mistress, Agent j5?
Still giving me information from the War Office.
Still asking for clothes and perfume?
She's a very demanding woman.
So... this makes 26 wonderful works of fiction.
The more agents,
the more information, the more risk.
Sometimes I worry
the whole house of cards could collapse.
It is elaborate and beautiful.
But fragile.
I was part of the Resistance
between 1940 and 1944.
My first group was disbanded.
My second leader was arrested and shot.
I am very lucky to have survived.
Four concrete casemates, six feet thick,
steel doors front and rear.
four to five machine guns in each.
Two six-foot barbed-wire perimeter fences,
anti-tank ditches and a minefield.
The battery was sighted
to fire along the length of Sword Beach,
across which the British Third Infantry Division
was going to land.
Everybody emphasized to me personally
what would happen if we failed.
Thousands of men killed on the beach.
Each casemate has a howitzer
with a seven-mile range.
They can hit incoming battleships and the beach
where 30,000 Allied troops will land.
They can do a lot of damage. Any questions?
- What is our mission, sir?
- To take it.
We have four hours to destroy the battery
before the landings begin.
"B" Company and "C" Company
will mount the main assault here.
A diversion party will attack the main gate here.
"A" Company will arrive in gliders
immediately prior to the initial assault.
- At night, sir?
- Where will they land, sir?
On top of it.
But it seemed so... impossible.
If we fail, the entire Allied left flank
could be decimated.
This mission is dangerous, but it's crucial.
London felt like the capital of the whole world.
It was the place to be,
especially if you were a journalist.
Everyone looked to Capa to be
the big-shot photographer for the invasion
because he had been covering war
ever since the Spanish Civil War in 1936.
Gotcha!
because his destiny was to...
to cover the world at its worst.
- I can't believe you're back.
- Of course I'm back.
I told the office
I hadn't seen my gal in seven months.
You're a terrible liar.
OK, but I want to be with the boys
when they liberate my Paris. I won't miss that.
Let's not talk about the war.
That's not what we're here for.
I thought you weren't wasting film.
Those guys are counting on me
to get the pictures of the big day.
Robert Capa, humanitarian and war photographer.
I'm a gambler, not a humanitarian.
Humanitarians believe in humanity.
For me, it's just a matter
of drawing the right cards.
Move!
Bang! Let's go! Come on, let's go!
Move! Move!
Too slow! Too late!
If you hesitate, you could be shot.
And they understood that.
Come in from the right!
Where's that bloody flamethrower?
Idle bastards, get in here!
OK, stop! Back to the start!
- We're good. We're bloody good!
- Not bloody good enough. Let's go!
- Did you ask Washington about landing craft?
- They're thinking about it.
Perhaps we could tell them not to think,
just to do it.
What about the rehearsals for the landings?
Exercise Tiger is due to take place
off the south coast on April 28th, sir.
Half of them have never even tasted battle before.
The least we can do is prepare them for it.
Exercise Tiger is a major rehearsal for D-Day.
Not just the beach landings,
but also the complex naval operations.
The seas between here and Normandy
are rife with danger.
We will take troops by night across open water
to designated target beaches on the south coast.
This is a training exercise,
but for everyone involved, it's the real thing.
I'm in one.
Pair of queens. Naval wins.
- What are you doing here?
- Best small-boat handler in the US Navy.
- Full ahead both.
- 420, full ahead both. Aye, sir.
The men seem pretty happy, sir.
I don't want them to be happy.
I want 'em to be ready.
- Life preservers!
- Anyone know what we do with these?
- You gonna show us how to put 'em on?
- Figure it out!
Radio.
Message Azalea. Contact surface.
Three targets bearing 275-280.
- What's going on?
- Three vessels approaching from the stern.
- That could be support.
- Maybe.
- No response from Azalea, skipper.
- Keep trying.
-
- What the...?
- Damn! They're in trouble.
- E-boats?
- Could be. Could be subs.
- Bridge, Signals.
- Bridge.
- Mayday. 531, 507. Both hit.
We're under attack.
Make to their location. Urgent.
- Sound general quarters.
- Doyle?
Let's go! Let's go!
OK, green 90!
They're firing at us!
Hold your fire! Stop firing!
You don't know who you're aiming at!
They could be ours!
It so happened I picked my headphones up
and I could hear the bridge talking.
- Orders are to return to port.
- They do not take account of our being attacked.
We cannot afford to lose more men or boats.
Follow orders and return to port!
Two ships are going down.
There are men in the water!
You will obey these orders, Doyle!
- Stand by to pick up survivors!
- Stand by to pick up survivors.
McCann to Bridge, McCann to Bridge!
- They'll freeze to death in that water.
- Support'll pick 'em up.
We don't even know if we have any support.
- Sir?
- McCann, there are men in the water.
- I want to send a boat out.
- I'd like to volunteer, sir.
You do have a choice. You know that?
Yes, Captain. I'd like to go, sir.
- Over there!
- Ramp down.
He's dead.
Over there! I think I can see him moving.
Don't worry, pal. You're gonna be OK.
We think some German E-boats
slipped through the destroyer screen.
They sank the two LSTs and damaged one other.
Casualties?
Damn!
How in God's name can we lose two ships and
over 700 men on a goddamn training exercise?
Our radio operators were working
on a different frequency than the Brits, sir.
And it seems as if the troops hadn't been
shown how to use their life preservers.
- Any captured?
- We don't know, sir.
And the men with security clearance
for "Overlord"? Are they accounted for?
Yes, sir. Ten.
All dead.
Well...
At least we know they won't talk.
It was getting near the time now.
I took my platoon out
into the middle of a football field
and told them
what I had just been told by the colonel.
Our target is, of course, a gun battery.
And to put it bluntly, it's lethal.
If we don't put it out of action,
a lot of men will die.
Our second mission is to take a radar station
about a mile from the battery.
Must be in France, then.
Each of us knows his job and there is
no doubt in my mind that we will do it...
provided we show organization,
precision and surprise.
And no cock-ups.
As if!
Good. Thank you.
Oh, and one more thing.
Special operation tonight, 2100 hours.
- Oh, sir!
- The colonel's orders.
- Evening, gents.
- Hello.
Carry on, gentlemen.
That's what I call live ammo.
- Well, well!
- Strangest special operation I've ever been on!
- Any plans for after the war, Mike?
- After the war?
Have to be positive.
- I was thinking about some farming.
- Dairy?
- Oranges.
- Oranges?
about which one of us would,
more or less, be killed first.
Me and the boys are having a wager.
Thought you'd like to join in.
I'll put five guineas on myself
or Lieutenant Dowling here.
Only five? I'll put ten on myself.
I'm in better shape than he is.
I found it worked.
# And soul by soul and silently
# Her shining bounds increase
# And her ways are ways of gentleness
# And all her paths are peace #
Pour onto our hearts
that most excellent gift of charity.
The very bond of peace...
Have a good evening last night?
Yes, sir. The men are very grateful.
It's nice to have some female company.
In fact, they were members
of the Women's Auxiliary Air Force.
I wanted to find out how tight our security was,
see if the men got careless with their pillow talk.
- Isn't that a bit underhand?
- No one said anything. Remarkably restrained.
The only person who lost sight
of his responsibilities was you, Lieutenant.
- Sir?
- Your briefing to the men.
You virtually identified the location of the target.
I was passing on the details of the mission, sir.
There are only four coastal radar stations
in mainland Europe next to a gun battery.
I was simply telling men whom I trust...
Corporal Philips is Internal Security.
Being liked by your men is gratifying,
but it is a luxury you cannot afford.
This operation is vital to the entire Allied assault.
My job is to ensure that nothing jeopardizes it.
The lives of my men or the invasion itself.
- Sir...
- I could have you court-martialled!
You're bloody lucky that you're needed!
Lieutenant Lane, we have a problem.
Intelligence suggests
Rommel has a new type of mine.
Unusual explosions, several at a time,
as though they're joined together.
- What can the French tell us?
- Nothing. That source has dried up.
Permanently?
- Probably.
- So you want us to take a closer look?
"Overlord" is ready to go and we cannot afford
any hitches. You know the stakes and the risks.
Hitler's orders are for all captured commandos
to be executed, but we have no choice.
You're from one of those special units,
aren't you?
Is it true you're all Jewish foreigners?
Beats me why you help us fight.
It's better if we don't tell each other
much about ourselves.
- Name and rank, that's all they'll get from me.
- Everybody talks eventually.
Ordinary landmine.
It's rusty because of the water.
- Could that be what makes it sensitive?
- Maybe.
It's more likely because they're close together,
set each other off.
Let's check inland.
Bollocks! We've been spotted!
- We're surrounded!
- What do we do now?
Wait to be captured.
Commando!
I was scared. Naturally, I was scared.
There I was in enemy country
and anything could happen to me.
And it was a very uncomfortable,
unpleasant situation, as you can imagine.
We have orders to...
hinrichten,
execute saboteurs.
If you think I'm a saboteur,
why do you invite me here?
- So this is an invitation?
- Yes. And an honor.
So...
You are a commando?
The best soldiers in the world.
How is my friend Montgomery?
Fine, I believe.
I only know what I read in the paper.
So where is it coming?
The invasion?
I have no idea. Nobody tells me anything.
But if it were up to me,
I would probably go for the shortest crossing.
May I ask a question?
Of course.
Do you think soldiers are the right people
to occupy a country once it's conquered?
Yes, I do.
Of course, we are trained to fight,
but we are also...
...anpassungsfähig.
Adaptable.
I believe a good soldier has a sense of duty.
A sense of responsibility.
Do you agree?
I think a good soldier is an honorable soldier.
It's a pity the Germans and British
aren't fighting together.
- Against who?
- The Russians, of course.
I think there are too many differences
between us for us ever to be allies.
- What differences?
- Treatment of the Jews, for example.
Now you are talking about politics!
That has nothing to do with us!
Don't worry. You will not be harmed.
You have my word as a fellow soldier.
It is in those days
that this battle will be won.
There will be much hard fighting on all fronts,
but we shall win in the end.
Let us go forward to victory.
Now then, D-Day itself...
It is essential that we maintain the deception
for at least three days after the landings.
Garbo could send a message
saying it isn't the real invasion.
Be hard to convince them when they have
To sell them the lie, we must give them a truth.
We give them a piece of information
which they consider extremely valuable.
They will then be in the right frame of mind
to be deceived.
- Isn't that rather dangerous?
- Yes, it is. Wars are like that, I suppose.
It's a nuisance,
but there's nothing we can do about it.
Two messages.
In the first, we give them the truth.
- We say Allied troops are due to land.
- On D-Day? That information is critical.
- We can't warn them.
- You're their main agent.
If they see troops landing and hear
nothing from you, they'll be suspicious.
The message must be early enough
to be a warning, but too late to take action.
That way we seal your credibility.
The trap is set and we send the second message.
I see.
- Agent 4 is the best man for the job.
- In Southampton?
He's in the right place. He will tell them
that he has seen troops boarding ships.
He's in a sealed camp.
He can't contact the outside.
I will tell them he deserted
with two other Americans, paratroopers.
Hmm. Signalmen or something.
Vomit bags. He saw vomit bags being
handed out to soldiers, and cold rations.
For the long boat trip to Normandy.
Subtle, but very believable.
Charlie! Have you met john Morris,
my picture editor at "Life"?
Look at you. You're impossible!
You take fairly sharp pictures,
you're quite good-looking,
you get around, and everyone wants
a piece of you. You're infectious.
- Infectious? Is it terminal?
- I think it might be for Pinky.
It's the way you carry it off
that drives her crazy. Me too!
Hey! You wanna dance? For old times' sake?
You want a slap in the face for old times' sake?
Can I have this dance?
Oh, God, please! This one has got two left feet!
- Do you forgive me?
- For what?
- Not being the man you want me to be.
- I will never forgive you for that.
You know the thing about gamblers?
What is it that keeps them
coming back to the table?
- The money, winning?
- Losing.
But not me.
I've no intention of losing.
I'll be coming home.
- OK.
- And Pinky... thank you.
- For what?
- For never making me choose.
- Between you and the war.
- Well, let's just say I'd be outnumbered.
- Have you been abroad before?
- Never been outside of Herefordshire.
I went to Cardiff once.
Paris, that's where we're heading.
- Wine and birds and fancy food.
- Don't mention food!
They said, "What would you like to do?"
I said, "Oh, RAF. That's a nice, safe area."
They said, "We're short of infantry.
You're going in the infantry."
It was obvious a lot of us
were not going to come back.
Only in... in boxes, like, you know.
At noon,
we raised anchor and were ready to go.
Slowly and majestically, as minesweepers
and destroyers curved their way into position,
we gave the lead to the other transports.
Under a gray sky, we looked at the coast
of Britain and watched it grow more dim.
Every man, soldier or sailor is learning
in detail the part he himself has to play.
Word from the top is that "B" Company
is the safer option when we launch.
- Safer?
- Well, it's still in the first wave.
But it'll be behind "E" Company.
"E" Company goes at the front
of the front where the action is?
Action will be everywhere, Capa. It's your choice.
You know what? I'm feeling lucky.
I'm already fleecing these guys.
I'll go with "E" Company.
If your pictures aren't good enough,
it's 'cause you're not close enough. Thank you.
So we have to keep the ships
where they are? And wait how long?
- The tide won't be right again for two weeks.
- Then it has to improve in the next 24 hours.
This might continue? It's June, for Christ's sake!
Do you guys get a summer?
- We might have to postpone!
- When's the next window?
- The 20th.
- Too late?
Out of the question. The troops can't sit
in those ships for two more weeks!
You plan the greatest force in history
and it ends up depending
on something you just can't control.
That's great
A glimmer of hope?
What kind of glimmer are we talking here?
The situation will change little,
but we predict a slight improvement
on the night of the 5th, increased visibility,
low chance of rain, less cloud cover, light winds.
But for how long?
To answer that question would make me
a guesser, sir, not a meteorologist.
So do we take the risk and go?
Or do we bring them all back?
All right.
Let's go.
For the first time in my life
I knew for sure the future.
- Do you mind?
- You want to take a photo?
- He wants to take a photo.
- Joe, come here, man!
Look at that dirt!
What's happened to you over there?
"Our landings in the CherbourgLe Havre area
have failed to gain a satisfactory foothold
"and I have withdrawn the troops.
"My decision to attack at this time and place
was based upon the best information available.
"If any blame or fault attaches
to the attempt, it is mine alone."
just in case.
just in case.
"Agent 4 broke out of his sealed camp yesterday
with two Americans from 926 Signal Corps.
"He has reported to me that soldiers
of the Canadian Third Division
"have been issued
with vomit bags and cold rations.
"I believe a major invasion
will be coming tonight."
# Give me a smile I can keep for a while
in my heart while I'm away
# Wish me luck... #
"You must all realize that. It may be you,
it may be me." They all knew that.
Steiner?
But it was kind of the feeling
of being balanced on the head of a pin.
Stand up! Stand up for equipment check!
- Stand up for equipment check!
- Stand up for equipment check!
- Six OK!
- Five OK!
- Four OK!
- Three OK!
- Two OK!
- One OK!
Come on!
Go! Go!
Punch!
- Punch!
- Judy!
- Seen any of the others?
- No, sir.
Come on. This way.
- How many men have we got?
- Less than 100.
"B" Company, 10 from "C" Company.
Find out if the engineers have arrived.
They never made it, sir.
No sign of the mortar party either.
We have nothing to signal the gliders in.
I can only describe it as looking as if
he'd been taken out of a deep freeze.
He was stiff and white
and obviously very uncomfortable.
- Any weapons canisters?
- No, sir.
have landed in the wrong bloody place!
Shall we wait, sir?
No time to wait!
And he said, "Get over there, Alan!
That's "C" Company."
And "C" Company was about three men,
which struck me as being a rather limited force.
Sir, still fewer than a quarter of the men
have turned up.
And the mine clearers didn't get their equipment.
They've cleared by hand and left boot tracks.
- What are we going to do, sir?
- Do? Attack it, of course.
Martin's men will carry out the diversion.
Dowling, you will breach the perimeter
and attack casemate two.
Jefferson, attack casemate one.
Russ and Long will attack three and four.
- What about demolition charges, sir?
- Improvise.
We attack... in five minutes.
Prepare your men. Gentlemen,
a lot of people are relying on us.
And I'm relying on you.
