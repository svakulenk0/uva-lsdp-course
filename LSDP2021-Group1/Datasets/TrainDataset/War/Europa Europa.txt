I was born on April 20, 1925,
in Peine...
Germany, Europe...
the fourth child
of Azriel Perel...
a shoe store owner,
and his wife Rebecca.
I was born on April 20, 1925,
in Peine, Germany, Europe.
You won't believe it...
but I remember my circumcision.
My God,
God of our forefathers...
let this child live...
...this child...
Solomon.
Solomon, son of Azriel.
I remember that my birthday
fell on the same day...
as that of the future Chancellor
of the Thousand-year Reich...
Adolf Hitler.
Maybe Father wanted to
shave his beard.
Not now he won't.
Come on, catch me!
Solly!
Hurry up!
What are you doing?
Come on out!
Is it your Bar Mitzvah or mine?
You have to cut wood.
Sure, right away.
Bertha was always jealous of me.
She wanted to be the boy.
Had I known,
I'd have leaped out of the tub.
Can't we close up?
In half an hour.
Out with the Jews!
Kathy!
What are you doing here?
And you?
I brought the beer.
They broke
all your windows, right?
Get me some clothes
from my house.
My father's forbidden
my going to your house.
Wait!
Here you are.
Isaac was looking for you.
My father was born in Lodz...
so we moved there.
He got us Polish passports
and said that now we were Poles.
I knew the Germans had
killed Bertha...
but I didn't want
to go to Lodz.
Police!
We lived above a movie house.
The cashier, Miss Basia...
made me her pet...
and let me in for nothing.
I wanted to be an actor...
like Clark Gable
or Eugeniusz Bodo.
I wondered whether her hump
was flesh or bone.
When the war broke out,
I was glad.
Now the police would forget
about the bicycle incident...
and Father wouldn't get angry.
Don't open the door!
Please don't!
David!
Have you deserted?
I never even found my unit.
It's incredible. They didn't
even give me a rifle.
The can't spare any
for distribution to Jews.
The Germans will win.
In a day or two,
they'll march in here.
It's your fault!
You said
we'd be safe here...
and that they wouldn't dare
start this war.
Yes, yes, It's my fault.
The boys must leave.
Solly must not fall
into their hands.
Where should they go?
East.
As far east as possible.
They could have asked us.
It is written...
that a son never leaves
his parents in difficult times.
It is also written...
that the son
must obey his parents.
And it is also your duty
to watch over your brother.
And you?
Couldn't we all go?
Nothing will happen to us.
Stop it!
They can't lug
all these jars.
Come. We'll be back soon.
Isaac, my foot hurts!
Come on, Solek.
There's a war on!
Solek!
Wait for me!
Wait for me
on the other side.
Don't be afraid!
Where are you going?
The Bolsheviks are there!
The Russian army!
They invaded us
from the other side.
They made a deal!
Hitler has a pact with Stalin...
and gave him the East!
There's no more Poland!
It's the Soviet occupation.
Wait!
I'm coming back with you!
The Poles preferred Hitler
and wanted to turn back.
The Jews swam
toward the Bolsheviks.
And l...
Help!
Take it easy!
I was saved
by a Russian soldier.
The next day I sat on the bank,
waiting for my brother, Isaac.
But he never came.
They took me to the orphanage
in Grodno...
where I stayed two years...
with other Jews,
Poles, and Russians.
I was turned into a Soviet
patriot and a good Communist.
Young pioneers...
for the struggle in the name
of Lenin and Stalin...
be prepared!
Always prepared!
Long live comrade Stalin!
Long live...
the Soviet Republic!
From your father?
Yes. He's a prisoner
of the Russians.
Solomon Perel!
Thanks to the Hitler-Stalin
pact, I could receive letters.
My father wrote...
"Dear Son,
We are happy to know...
"that you are well, safe,
and are studying.
"We are OK.
We had to move to the ghetto...
"as do all the Jews.
"Don't worry about us.
"Thinking of you
gives us courage.
"Are you eating Kosher?
Always remember who you are!
"Do you observe the Sabbath?
Greetings to your teachers.
"Your mother sends her love.
Your Father.
"P.S. Our address...
"is Knupfergasse 7."
Your origins?
You left them out.
Jewish.
ldiot! We know that.
We're asking about
your class origins.
You didn't indicate
your class origins!
He doesn't understand.
My father had a store.
Bourgeois.
Solly's making an effort.
He's doing a lot of social work.
I'll prove
I'm a worthy Komsomol.
You've been accepted into
the Komsomol? Where's the badge?
There aren't any more.
Stalinist puppet!
You know what would happen
if I reported that?
Bastards!
The landowners and the bourgeois
keep the people in ignorance.
They encourage
religious superstitions...
and with the help of the popes,
priests, and rabbis...
they smother
all revolutionary instinct.
That's why we call religion
the opium of the masses.
It's not true!
That God doesn't exist!
He exists!
Where is he?
He exists, that's all.
In Heaven.
Does anyone else
share this opinion?
You're alone in your beliefs.
Filthy Poles!
What is this?
A conspiracy?
The discussion is pointless.
Science has proven...
Dirty Jew!
You're the one who crucified...
Jesus!
You're an obscurantist
and a racist!
Polish fascist!
Lords...
aristocrats!
Do you know what Lenin
said about anti-Semitism?
That It's a crime
as bad as counterrevolution!
My brother was killed
by the Germans!
When I return to Poland...
Hell will freeze over first.
Poland will never
be Poland again.
That's a lie!
All right.
Let's try a little experiment.
You all know how to pray,
don't you? Then pray...
Lord, as a sign
of Your existence...
send us candies from Heaven.
What are you waiting for?
Go on.
Lord...
send us candies.
Louder! I heard nothing, and
your God is way up in Heaven!
Now, repeat after me.
Beloved comrade Stalin,
send us candies!
Communism is beautiful.
War!
Hitler has attacked!
You're crazy! Dirty slut!
I'm requisitioning the truck!
Climb in, boys, quick!
This is sabotage!
You are sabotaging the orders
of the Soviet leaders!
Your leaders...
have flown the coop!
Do what you want!
On your feet!
Hands up!
Jews, step forward!
You don't understand?
Jews, out front!
Get a move on!
Faster! Move it!
Papers!
No! Armenian!
I am Armenian!
I'm not a Jew!
Check it, please!
Check it?
Good idea!
We'll check it.
Armenian?!
And what's that? You wanted
to bugger us with your cock?
Take him away.
What'll they do to us?
They'll shoot Jews
and political prisoners.
I know. I was already captured.
The others are put in camps.
It's shameful to spread panic.
Destroy the papers!
I'd rather die...
than renounce the Party.
Then die...
for the homeland.
For Stalin!
Let's see those.
Hands behind your heads!
Faster! Faster!
Where are you taking me?
They were stolen.
You speak German well.
I am German.
Why are you here?
Maybe he's a Jew?
I am German...
a pure-bred German.
I'm German, from Grodno.
I was in
a Bolshevik orphanage.
I can smell Jews.
I'm a German from Grodno.
The Bolsheviks forced me
into the orphanage.
Schultz! Carry on!
I'll take him to the sergeant.
Amazing to find such a diamond
among such filth.
Who asked you?
You made your report, now go!
Nothing to do?
This is not a Jewish school!
Name?
Peters...Josef Peters.
Stop, idiot!
Your parents are German?
We say, "Jawohl!"
And where are your parents?
He said he was
in an orphanage.
The Bolsheviks
must have killed them.
Don't cry, son.
They'll pay for this.
Enough!
Your papers, my boy!
You can do nothing here
without papers.
You're insane!
Send the kid over!
Josef, damn it!
Your name is Josef!
Go on!
You do speak Russian.
I clearly said
Jews should step forward.
This one's playing dumb.
Captain, I know Russian.
Tell them he's not a Jew,
and if they touch him...
they'll regret it.
He says he's not a Jew, and if
you touch him, you'll regret it.
Watch it, you Russian scum!
Take this Jew away!
Both of them!
I said he's not a Jew!
He's Stalin's son.
Well? Translate!
He said that...
that he's Stalin's son.
What does it say?
"Dzhugashvili, Yakov..."
"son of Yosef."
Stay here!
Don't move!
You, move along!
Faster!
Where'd you learn Russian?
In school. In Grodno.
I was a Komsomol.
Now you're obeying
these fascist pigs?
What did he want?
I didn't understand.
It's a dialect...
Tell him to watch
where he spits.
lf he insults a German,
he'll get himself shot.
Tell him I have orders to
drive them to the Kommandatur.
Come on, kid!
You're our good luck charm!
You witnessed the Reich's
victory. The son of Stalin!
Do you know what that means?
Smile!
He speaks perfect Russian.
He'll be useful.
You must be hungry.
Perel!
He's a Jew!
He says there's a Jew here.
Where?
He says I'm the Jew.
He says It's me!
You know him?
So what does he want?
I don't know.
Ask him.
Why, Zenek? Why do that?
What? Aren't you a Jew?
And I'm a Polish fascist?
Correct?
A fine answer!
Stop!
You're still alive, Jupp?
The Captain wants to see you.
Wait for his questions.
Answer only yes or no.
Stand at attention.
He insists on that.
And don't turn around
when he paces.
And not a word...
about the Communist school.
He can't stand the Bolsheviks.
Careful! You can't fool him.
One look,
and he knows everything!
Peters,
to the company commander!
I'll be damned!
Age?
Sixteen.
My men are fond of you.
Please.
No, Captain.
Who was your father?
My father...
My father was a businessman.
And...you have nobody left?
No relatives?
Would you stay
as our interpreter?
I want to serve
our German homeland.
You'll have many chances.
The future belongs
to your generation.
You know against whom
we're fighting this war?
Against Russia?
Against France?
Against England?
No, my boy. Against Jews.
It's our Jewish war,
our holy war.
It's not a question
of "Lebensraum."
We must liberate Europe
from the Jews.
Do you understand?
Jawohl, Captain.
You can be proud...
to be taking part
in this holy war.
What will happen to them?
Will they be killed?
Who?
The Jews.
We'll see.
They'll be moved out.
To Madagascar or Siberia.
Don't worry.
The Fuhrer will find
a solution.
Don't look.
No, let him look!
Look, Jupp!
These swine killed
your German parents...
for being Germans!
They stole your home!
Watch them pay for it!
Look at the animals!
You must learn to hate!
That's when I first felt
how confused I was.
Who was my friend, who my enemy?
How could they be kind to me...
and at the same time
kill others so horribly?
What set us apart?
A simple foreskin?
"I feel German pride...
"in spilling my blood
for Fuhrer and homeland."
Sounds a bit stiff.
Either lyrical or patriotic.
As you describe her,
It's patriotism.
You can add...
What do you call her?
Yes, when you're alone with her.
"My little pussy."
Write...
"For you, my little pussy...
"I'd like to..."
"A shudder passes through me."
"Tears follow upon tears."
"The stern heart...
"has become soft."
"And all I own
seems far away.
"And all I lost is real."
That's way over her head.
Aren't you tired?
Not yet. And you?
I'm going on watch duty.
The stars...
They're the same
as in Germany...
but farther away.
I was never there.
That's true.
But you'll get there.
I won't.
Why not?
I'm joking.
We'll go together.
We'll go to Berlin.
What did you do
before you became a soldier?
"Philosophy have I digested.
"The whole of Law and Medicine,
Theology, alas thrown in.
"From each its secrets
I have wrested."
"Poor fool,
with all this sweated lore.
"I stand no wiser than before."
Recognize it?
Sure.
I'm an actor.
A real actor?
Naturally!
In movies, too?
Naturally!
ls it hard
to play someone else?
It's much easier
than playing yourself.
Jupp, wait!
I won't do anything!
Wait!
Don't run!
You're circumcised.
You're a Jew?
My God...
No, please, get up.
Don't be afraid.
Forgive me.
I had no idea.
Everything will be fine.
I'll be like a brother,
like a friend.
There now, calm down.
Don't cry anymore.
Don't be afraid.
Germans aren't all the same.
There are other Germans, too.
During that holiday,
you lived...
in the huts for a whole week?
Does that mean
that Jews don't have homes?
It symbolizes
our submission to God.
It is proof...
of our faith in providence.
Bertha loved this holiday.
I hated Passover.
I had to eat eggs
dipped in salt water.
They made me nauseous.
I was wondering...
Do you still pray,
like at home?
Religion is the opium
of the masses.
Could I play a Jew?
You look too stupid.
You racist!
The Russians are still
on the other side.
We just flushed them
out of here.
Jupp, over here, fast!
Take the phone.
Listen in.
Can you understand them?
He says he screwed her
three times, and the fourth...
And?
The other asks where she is.
So, where is she?
In Brunsk.
He says the Germans are there.
Great!
Cut the line.
Russian shit! My shoes!
He's aiming at a German cycle...
with two soldiers.
He's about to burn their asses.
Stay there. I'm coming!
My helmet...
You see,
you kissed me after all...
Retreat to the forest!
And so I lost my only friend...
"the other kind of German."
He left my life like Kathy,
the hunchback Basia...
lnna Moyseyevna, my father
and mother, Bertha and Isaac.
All those I'd loved.
I won't go on.
I can't go on.
I want to be by myself,
to be among my own kind.
Comrade! Can you hear me?
Who is it?
Help me! I said I was
a pure-bred German...
but I'm a Komsomol from Grodno.
I'm a Jew. They'll kill me
if they find out.
Where are you?
The trench by the bridge,
just below the fire.
We forgot the line!
Have you been listening long?
You killed them all.
Ullmayer, the sergeant,
Robert...
Good work!
Hey, Komsomol,
can you hear me?
At nightfall we hold our fire.
Get over to the river
and across the bridge.
There are seven of us
on a hill here.
Take a rifle.
Do you have one?
Hold it up so we recognize you.
We'll keep you covered.
And cut the line!
Right now!
Jupp! Son,
you captured the enemy position.
So, instead of deserting...
I became the hero
of the company.
Captain, I'd rather stay
here with my comrades.
You've shown enough courage.
Now you go to school, study.
And see the Reich, at last.
It's an excellent school.
You should be proud to go there.
When the war is over...
if you want to...
I wrote to my wife...
We have no children...
We want to adopt you.
We have land in Pomerania.
You'll like it. At ease!
For my wife.
A special Party envoy
came out from the Reich...
to bring the hero
of the Reich...
future son
of Captain von Lerenau...
aristocrat
and staunch anti-Semite...
to the most elite
Hitler Youth School.
Good luck, Jupp! Our regards
to the Reich! Write to us!
A Hitler Youth doesn't smoke.
Will you survive?
What else doesn't he do?
As a war hero, you may at times
act like a man.
A German man.
A true German soldier!
Puff on mine if you like.
How handsome you are.
Do you know it?
My pure little golden boy.
Papers.
The young man's
temporary papers.
Born April 20...
Lights out, please.
You were born the same day
as the Fuhrer.
Your hair is dark, like his.
My darling...
So soft and tender.
Touching him with my hand...
his hair, his lips...
My Fuhrer!
Assembly!
Attention!
We welcome the German
of pure breed...
Josef Peters...
whom our troops liberated
from the Bolshevik orphanage.
As an interpreter
and as a soldier...
he served our country
heroically.
We are proud to welcome him
into our ranks.
Josef...
are you ready to swear
allegiance to our Fuhrer...
Adolf Hitler?
I am ready.
I swear before God...
...with this solemn oath...
...to give the Fuhrer...
...of the German Reich
and its people...
...Adolf Hitler...
...the Commander-in-Chief
of the Hitler Youth...
...total obedience...
...and, in case of any danger...
...to be ready...
...to give up my life.
You can lower your arm.
Our new comrade will see...
that our Fuhrer has created
a community...
in which all Germans
are brothers.
The world's strongest community.
We salute our new comrade
with a triple...
Sharpen...
the long knives...
on the pavement stone!
Sink the knives...
into Jewish flesh and bone.
Let the blood flow freely!
You don't know it?
Didn't you sing it
at the front?
No.
You'll learn.
You'll learn everything here.
Schwarz!
Look after Peters!
He's your roommate.
Get him a uniform.
It's a pleasure.
Same here.
This will be much harder
than among the soldiers.
The smallest detail
could give me away.
"Sink the knives
into Jewish flesh and bone."
My flesh!
That's for you.
I'm Herman.
Be seated!
You're the new hero?
Your name?
Jupp, and you?
Leni.
Having been at the front
is sufficient.
She's the best one here,
but she's unapproachable.
lsn't he cute?
We pray before meals.
Eat correctly,
using knife and fork.
The knife in the right hand...
the fork in the left.
No slurping, no crumbs.
Respect our German bread.
Enjoy the meal.
Attention, Goethke!
How do you recognize...
a Jew?
How do you recognize a Jew?
Be seated.
That's quite simple.
The composition of Jewish blood
is totally different from ours.
The Jew has a high forehead...
a hooked nose...
a flat back of the head...
ears that stick out...
and he has an ape-like walk.
His eyes are shitt...
and cunning.
He never looks you in the eye.
He waves his hands about...
makes exaggerated gestures...
and he fawns before you.
But the minute
your back is turned...
he leaps at your throat!
The Nordic man...
is the gem of this earth.
He's the most glowing example...
of the joy of creation.
He is not only
the most talented...
but the most beautiful.
His hair is as light
as ripened wheat.
His eyes are blue
like the summer sky.
His movements are harmonious.
His body is perfect.
You can call me a gem.
Science...
is objective.
Science...
is incorruptible.
As I have already told you...
if you thoroughly understand
racial differences...
no Jew will ever
be able to deceive you.
Step forward.
The eyes...
Look at his skull.
His forehead.
His profile.
Although his ancestors' blood,
over many generations...
mingled with that
of other races...
one still recognizes
his distinct Aryan traits.
It's from this mixture...
that the East-Baltic race
evolved.
Unfortunately, you're not part
of our most noble race...
but you are
an authentic Aryan.
A special bulletin!
The heroic battle
of Stalingrad is over.
True to its oath,
with its dying breath...
the 6th Army, under
the outstanding leadership...
of Field Marshal Paulus,
fell to...
the enemy's superior numbers.
Generals, officers, and simple
soldiers fought side by side...
until the last bullet.
The army's sacrifice
was not in vain.
Our soldiers died
so that Germany may live.
How do you whistle?
Like this.
How do you feel?
You don't know the Reich.
You don't understand.
We have complete freedom here.
Like our school for example.
My father is a teacher,
Hans' father is a mason.
And Herman's father
is a baron.
There is no difference among us.
We all have
the same opportunities.
You understand?
We are brothers, true brothers.
I could eat them all.
They're made of plaster.
You have no imagination.
I have too much.
I can't look!
Are you there?
I can't see you.
I must be going.
See you tomorrow.
Leni's sweater inspired me
to pull my skin way down...
and tie it with a thread.
lf it stayed in place,
I'd never be recognized...
and I could live like them.
Come in.
My mother, Jupp.
Let's sit down.
For you.
We couldn't accept
such a generous gift.
I have plenty.
Captain Lerenau's wife
sent me a package.
We own property on Pommern.
They want to adopt him.
Fine, but only
if we eat it together.
Papa...
died in battle.
Sit down, please.
I hear you have no parents?
I don't know where they are.
Didn't you say that...
the Bolsheviks killed them?
Gerd told me.
Yes, the Bolsheviks
arrested them...
then a truck ran them over.
That's the official version.
Nice picture.
Really? That's me.
My cousin was a painter.
He even knew the Fuhrer!
From Vienna!
Leni resembles me, right?
Her father had dark hair,
like you.
Lord...
forget not those
who suffer and are hungry.
Comfort the lonely...
and give your blessing...
to the orphans. Amen.
Eat, Jupp.
Your tears will
make the ham saltier.
It's nothing.
It's just...
It's been so long
since I've been...
in a nice home.
Are you hurt?
No. It's nothing.
You're lucky.
Tomorrow the doctor pays us
his annual visit.
Leave me alone!
ls something wrong?
That queer
grabbed my balls again.
We have to undress?
Of course.
My tooth!
It hurts so much,
I can't talk.
I need a dentist.
Strange,
it looks quite healthy.
Tying the foreskin
was not successful.
Pus had formed
under the thread.
After the thread was removed,
the skin slipped back.
I couldn't escape my own body.
I still had to hide.
lntimacy was impossible.
I couldn't love Leni.
You pricked me!
The golden insignia!
I didn't know!
We could do it.
I want to, Jupp. You understand?
I really want to.
You're much too young.
You're really crazy!
I have to leave.
I'll walk you.
lf you like.
You're really crazy, Jupp!
Catch me!
I didn't know there was
a Jewish cemetery here.
lf I ever catch a Jew...
Then what?
I'll cut his throat.
Why?
Because he's a Jew.
Captain von Lerenau said...
Hitler said
we needn't kill them.
We'll just send them
to Madagascar.
Lice must be crushed!
The Fuhrer knows best!
The Fuhrer didn't
lose his father...
in the war against
those vermin.
You hit me...
to defend the Jews!
Leni, forgive me.
Nobody hits a German woman!
Nobody! Ever!
Especially not a limp-dick
like you!
Bertha!
Father!
Mamma...
I'm back.
Isaac?
Hide. They're coming!
He's Jewish, too. That's why he
covers it with his hands.
Look for us in the Lodz ghetto.
Knupfergasse 7!
Don't give me away!
What happened?
You screamed.
You probably had a bad dream.
What words did I scream?
I didn't understand...Russian.
I won't visit
the Captain's wife.
I'll go to Lodz...
to Litzmannstadt...
Why Litzmannstadt?
There are many Germans there.
I might find...
some of my relatives.
Stop!
To get across town...
take the trolley
through the ghetto.
Over there.
The ghetto's off-limits,
even to Germans.
Sit down. You're in the way.
Mother...
The windows must remain shut.
I want some fresh air.
Fresh air?
In the ghetto?
Had it been my mother?
I rode through the ghetto often,
but I never saw her again.
Good! Next, forward!
Better than that!
Fine. Again!
And now.
Bad, Peters!
Try again!
Next, forward!
ls Leni home?
No.
She's rarely here. She makes
packages for the front.
Excuse me. I'll be leaving.
No. Come in, please.
Sit down.
I'm nearly finished.
May I help?
No, thanks. I've finished.
In case you hadn't heard...
Leni is pregnant.
She read that
every German woman...
must give a child
to the Fuhrer...
and she felt it her duty.
She's been avoiding me lately.
It hasn't been easy.
Leni is fond of you, Jupp.
Obviously.
Goethke...
Your teacher told her the father
had to be a Nordic type.
There were many ltalians
in my husband's family...
and Leni was afraid
the child...
might not be
racially pure enough...
to be accepted
in the "Lebensborn."
She'll give it up?
She's offering it
to the Fuhrer.
And you're letting her?
What can I do?
I no longer understand
my daughter.
I love Leni.
So do l.
She's all I have.
Same here.
At least, I thought so.
It's Gerd, isn't it?
Leni said you wouldn't go
beyond a certain point.
I told her
it was a sign of respect...
but maybe...
You think I didn't want to?
I'm not made of stone.
I have feelings, too!
Josef, tell me.
Are you really German?
No.
I'm a Jew.
I knew it!
From the beginning.
I swear I won't betray you.
I had to tell someone.
I couldn't stand it anymore.
You mustn't tell Leni.
Children nowadays...
they're so different.
You scum! Get up!
You call yourself a friend?
What's the matter?
I didn't want to.
Where have you been?
Bring your papers
to the police.
The police? Why?
Something isn't clear to them.
I'll come along. lf we hurry,
we can do it before class.
Name?
Which Peters?
My parents came to Grodno
from Latvia.
I knew a Peters...
but from Danzig.
We're missing many papers
from there.
Serviceman...
Your Certificate
of German Purity?
It's still in Grodno.
We must request it...
to avoid
any unpleasant problems.
lf the Russians take Grodno,
you'll have problems.
You mean it could...
Our General Staff
has a brilliant plan.
We will pretend to retreat
on all fronts...
and then,
when all seems lost...
the Fuhrer gives the signal...
and with our miracle weapon,
we will annihilate the enemy!
I saw the Fuhrer last week.
He was confident or our victory.
I'll write to Grodno today.
After the victory, we'll need
and you are one of them!
Only a miracle
could save me now.
They'll kill us all!
The Americans take prisoners...
but the Russians shoot everyone.
You defeatist! Shoot!
Fire!
For the Fuhrer!
What's wrong, Jupp?
Shoot!
He's been hit!
Shoot, Jupp!
Jupp, shoot!
We're surrounded!
Where are you going?
You're insane!
Stop!
I'm on your side!
Where did you learn Russian?
At school, in Grodno...
I was a Komsomol.
Traitor! Spy!
I can explain.
I was hiding. I'm a Jew!
I'm a Jew!
A Jew?
lf you were a Jew,
you'd look like this.
Look!
Corpses, heads...
These children, see them?
And this!
Look at these heads!
Hung, shot!
I didn't know.
I thought...Madagascar...
I didn't know.
Another one who didn't know.
Give me that, Arkady!
Let's go.
He's yours.
Do what you want.
Shoot him like a dog.
Solek!
My parents and all
their neighbors were killed...
two weeks after
my leave in Lodz.
Isaac stayed until
the liquidation of the ghetto...
then he was taken
to a concentration camp.
While I was shouting
"Heil Hitler"...
and courting Leni...
my family was already dead.
Solek...
We're going over
to the Americans.
We'll get some
concentration camp clothes.
That won't be difficult.
You understand?
Don't tell your story
to anyone.
Nobody will believe you.
Lift up your head.
We're starting a new life.
Help me.
From that moment on,
I decided to be only a Jew.
Leaving Europe,
I emigrated to Palestine.
And when I had sons, I barely
hesitated to circumcise them.
How sweet it is to sit.
Surrounded by your brothers.
How sweet it is to sit.
Surrounded by your brothers.
