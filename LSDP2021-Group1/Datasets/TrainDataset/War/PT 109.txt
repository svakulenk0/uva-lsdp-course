On August 7th 1942, elements
of the 1st Marine Division
The American Navy was assigned the job
of sea support in the Solomon islands.
There were few capital
ships available
and they were ill suited for
narrow channel warfare.
The PT boats were, they were
fast shallow draught withers
Their assignment:
harass the enemy
and buy time for a Navy that
was still on the drawing boards.
This narrative concerns one
of those boats and its crew
commanded by lieutenant
John F. Kennedy, PT109
Rogers!
Yes sir!
Please notify these three officers
they'll be disemarking in an hour.
Yes sir!
End of the line Mr. Taubot.
It's loggin about an hour.
Thanks Rogers.
- Mr. Claybon, won't be long now.
- Much obliged.
Mr. Kennedy, war is ready.
Oh, thanks Rogers.
Mr. Kennedy, can I be frank
with you for a minute?
Sure, come on in Rogers.
I've always had good luck being
frank with lieutenants.
It's ensigns and admirals
you can't talk to.
Right after this trip, I'm
shipping on to the beach of Pearl.
So far so good, now hear this.
Right away get yourself transfered back
to the States. Zingo, you sent for me.
Zingo?
We'd make a great team.
Maybe running a nice wave barracks
or Jacksonville or some town where they
got a few sensible after hour joints.
Rogers, I just got here!
Oh, you don't want this Mr. Kennedy.
Believe me, I've been in this Navy.
The worst thing you could do is
let them trick you onto an ocean.
PT boat, nothing but a plywood coffin.
Well, I can't ask for a transfer.
Of course you can. I've got
a... little background on you.
The word, you've got the juice, you've
got pliers down there in Washington.
The juice?
Juice, muscle, glicerine!
Don't they teach you any
It's an elective.
Tell the old men to drop the
word into somebodies head.
Tell them to holla lady. You
can get out of here in a no time.
I'm sorry Rogers, I'm affraid I used
all that glicerine to get down here.
You mean you negotiated
your way out here?
That's right!
You put in a fix
to go the wrong way?
Right.
Mr. Kennedy, they are
fighting out here!
Wait, hold it, maybe it's not to late.
Tell them you went psycho, you... you
ate some poison meat, you woke up dizzy!
It's too late Rogers and I'm
surprised at you. Where is your spirit?
Spirit?
What's that?
A willingness to fight
for what you believe in!
Oh, that spirit Mr. Kennedy,
I got it, I believe in a transfer!
You know I wouldn't snow you.
Thinking like this,
you just not gonna make out.
General quarters! General quarters!
All men, man your battle stations.
Hey you! Hey you fella! Give
that sailor a hand with the ammo.
Mr. Kennedy!
Welcome to the South Pacific.
Best of luck Jack.
Same to you captain.
- See you around Jack.
- Right Pete!
Ladie!
Yes, sir!
I'm tellin' you for the last time.
I don't want this crane in the pier
area when we're loading ammunition!
Yes sir!
And I don't permit oil drumms in the area
when we're loading ammunition either.
Yes sir!
Afternoon sir.
Good afternoon. Even if I should permit it
you should know better than to permit it.
Yes sir!
What's your problem?
I was looking for the
Squadron Commander, sir!
Ladie! I saw your friend Nesbitt
ditch that cigarette butt!
You can tell him for me that he's
in trouble, he's in real trouble.
Yes sir!
Look at them.
Skippers, they call them selves.
They're not Naval officers, they're nothing
but a bunch of civilians dressed up in costume.
What...what was bothering you?
I was lookin' for the
Squadron Commander, sir.
Which Squadron?
PT Squadron 2.
That'll be Lieutenant Cluster.
Right straight down the main street
past this side of the post office.
Last tent.
Thank you, sir!
You're very welcome.
- Ladie!
- Yes, sir!
I'm putting you on report for
not putting Nesbitt on report.
Yes sir!
Fender head.

Lieutenant Cluster?
Lieutenant!
Here. What is it?
Lieutenant Kennedy,
reporting for duty, sir.
Kennedy?
Yes, sir.
Come in, sit down.
What time is it?
It's a...quarter of a 2, sir.
A quarter of 2?
Mister, you just woke me up
in the middle of the night.
Oh, I'm sorry sir,
I didn't know your schedule.
That's all right lieutenant.
I'm Al Cluster.
Jack Kennedy.
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you, Jack.
Help yourself to a cigarette.
Oh, thanks, no.
What can I do for you?
Well, I'm reporting for duty, sir.
What's your specialty?
PT skipper.
Oh, that's too bad.
I need an engeneering officer.
Wanna take a crack at it?
Well, aren't there any boats?
No, not right now, but
I can put you on staff.
Or, as I said engeneering
officer, I really need one.
Well, if it's all same to you sir,
I had counted on a boat.
You did, ha?
Well, there's a 109.
I suppose you can call that a boat.
Now that you mentioned it, but the
engeneering job... it wouldn't last
Oh, the 109 would be fine sir.
Hmm, well, will go and take a look
at her, cause it's all up to Ritchie,
he's our boat maintenance officer.
Sweet soul.
You'll meet him soon enough.
I think I already have.
Lieutenant, can you tell me more
about... hmm, Commander Ritchie?
Retread, he was on destroyers
in the First war, retired,
then called back again
couple of years ago.
Strictly regulation.
Does an honest job.
Only trouble he doesn't like this hooligan
Navy much better than he does the Japanese.
Now, there's our happy crew.
Hey you Bing Crosbies, paint, slap it
on, this ain't no movie stars bedroom.
Let's get this boat out of here.
There was a happy ship.
Is it always like this hot?
No, Mr. Kennedy, it gets hotter.
Any... any questions?
Yeah, is it one of ours?
Yap, officialy listed, 109.
A lot of wear and tear, isn't it?
Oh no, it just needs woman's touch.
Least.
Wanna take a look at the engines?
What kind of shape are they in?
Not quite as good as the rest of the boat.
Let's save the worst
for last, alright!?
Alright!
Well, it's gonna take a lot of work,
I don't quite know where to begin.
You ought a start laying the keel!
Still want her?
I'd like to give it a try.
Mr. Kennedy, you try this
you'll try anything.
This way!
Good afternoon sir.
Good afternoon lieutenant.
Commander Ritchie, this is lieutenant
Kennedy. He just checked in.
Oh, yes, yes...we met.
Welcome aboard lieutenant.
Thank you sir.
He thinks he'd like a crack at a 109.
Don't be a damn fool.
Show him the boat.
I've seen it sir.
You think that boat would
ever pass inspection?
Yes sir.
Another hot rod.
Alright, Mr. Kennedy,
you have one week to put it
in shape, that means one week,
that means in shape!
We'll have to get him
a good crew to help.
He'll get a crew alright, whether they're
any good or not, will be up to Mr. Kennedy.
Yes, sir.
Well, I'll see what can I round up.
You do that.
Oh, I'm sorry sir, I didn't
get a chance to clean up.
It's all right lieutenant.
You know, this entire generation's
gonna wind up dying flat on its belly.
Nothing personal, lieutenant.
Snyby!
This thing is full
of strikeovers again.
I could chain up a monkey in the
basement to get better results!
Try using your elbows!
Come in, come in, sit down.
Nah, it's not like the old Navy.
In old days you could eat off the deck.
Imagine, you can eat off the thing.
Yes sir, they told us out of Melwill.
Now days these kids, these hotentots
take those boats out, they
bounced them around like yo-yos.
Where?
Melwill, sir.
Mr. Kennedy, I don't
care where you've been,
I don't wanna know
anything about you,
I don't care whether you've got a mother, a
father, an orphan child... you understand?
You just run a toward ship
hang on to Navy regulations.
You do, you'll find me a friendly man.
Damn friendly man,
if you don't, you...
Snyby, where is that memo?
I'm gonna chain up that monkey.
Oh, that's all, Mr. Kennedy.
Yes sir.
A movie for the night...
Well, you can be replaced
by a wave, you know?
That's all Snyby.
Welcome to the South Pacific.
Mr. Kennedy.
Ensign Leonard Thom, your exec.
Oh, hi! Glad to meet you Leonard.
Welcome aboard.
How long did they give you
to put it in shape?
Well, we've used about half the
time just talking right here.
What about the crew?
So far I got a...
one land crab.
Come on Leonard,
I'll show you around.
Are they kiddin'?
Look at this thing.
Is that our mother ship?
Holly Toledo!
Shouldn't we store our gear aboard?
Better wait for an officer to report to.
Who do we drew?
- I don't know.
- I gotta run down upon to the yeoman.
The exec, is ensign named Leonard Thom.
Served some sea duty.
Use to ba a taccle on the
Ohio State football team.
That rules out mutiny.
How about the old man?
J.G., named Kennedy.
What the hell are you doin'?
- I'm killin' elephants...
- Will you stop it.
- Why?
- Makes me nervous.
Suffer!
Seems all he ever did was go
to school, he's had no sea duty.
Says here he wrote a book.
Sounds like he ought to be
in charge of the library.
What's the name of the book?
"Why England Slept".
Any pictures in it?
Picdures?
Pictures, idiot.
He's lookin' for pictures
and I'm an idiot.
I'm servin' under a guy like this,
we've rate the Purple Heart.
Well keep it in mind.
I don't think you've met our new
executive officer, ensign Thom.
I'm lieutenent Kennedy.
Drewitch, sir.
Motor machinist, 2nd.
Drewitch.
I'm Harris, sir.
Gunners mate, 2nd.
Harris.
We were just sayin' sir,
she's a very seaworthy craft.
Lot of potential anyway.
Any relation to Bucky?
No sir, they call me that
though sometimes.
Drawdy is my name sir,
motor machinist 2nd.
Alright, you may stow your
gear in the engeneering shaq,
we're staying there till
we get squared away.
Ah, Mr. Kennedy.
Yes, Drewitch?
There's only three of us
to clean up this whole boat!
There is five of us.
This is the whole crew?
Well, it's all we have for now.
Why?
We'll spend the rest of the war
just gettin' the boat in shape.
Then we better get started.
Ai ai, sir.
Alright, you're home men,
get your gear.
Six new hands, selected
with the upmost of care
to meet the requirements of the 109.
Only six available.
I'm Kirksey sir,
torpedoman 2nd.
Kirksey.
Maguire, sir.
Radioman 2nd.
Maguire.
Marney, sir,
motormech 2nd.
Marney.
Kowal, sir,
Gunner's mate 3rd.
Kowal.
Albert, sir,
seaman 2nd class.
Albert.
Mauer, sir, seaman 1st.
Mauer. Where is your gear Mauer?
I was on the "Niagara" sir, my...
my gear went down with the ship.
We'll see if we can
scare up some stuff for you.
Thank you.
Right.
Any of you men know how to cook?
Cook?
Yeah, yeah, I used to fix some
stuff for my kid brother, sir.
Good, you are our new cook.
What kind of stuff?
Peanut butter sandwiches, sir.
Nothing else?
Oh, sometimes I'd stick
some jelly on them, sir.
Well, ah... maybe you could
cook up a third specialty, ha?
Maybe.
Drewitch, you wanna show the
men where to stow their gear.
Sir.
Drawdy.
Show this men where
to stow their gear.
Come on.
What do you think Jack, think
they'll do a good job for us?
Sure!
We do one for them.
If we did get it ready in a week,
it wouldn't pass Ritchie's master.
I wouldn't worry about that, Andrew,
my boy. We're still one engine short.
Here you are. One box,
Thanks.
See what you can do by getting
terra for that sick torpedo.
We'll do.
Sam.
Thanks!
How you fellas going?
Well sir, we've got more cosmoline
in disolvings than on the gun.
Oh, here, hand it to me,
I'll get some clean stuff.
Thank you.
Alright! Alright!
Send down the bum that done this!
Sorry chief, I guess I am your man.
You know what you got
for a brain buddy?
A seed pearl. You know
how big a seed pearl is?
It's the damn smallest
pearl in the world!
Now I'm coming up there to
tell you the rest of it.
Let's go sailor!
Permission to come aboard, sir.
Permission granted.
Chief, I'm sorry about that.
It's not you sir, it's that cotton
picking enlisted man over there.
I'm gonna get that son of a gun
that dumped the oil on my head.
I'm affraid I'm your man chief.
I'm a chief petty officer in this Navy
and I'm not gonna take that sort of things.
I'm your man.
What sir?
I...I didn't realise anybody was on
the other side. I'm sorry about that.
Well sir, I think them seed pearls
is about the best I can do for you!
Say chief, with your permission,
I'd like to replace that shirt.
Permission granted.
Wanna try?
Why not?
Commander, do you really think
they can pass this inspection?
The moment of truth.
He'll say no.
Two to one?
Alright, two chocolate bars to one.
You're on!
Alright, all hands, man your
cleaning stations for inspection!
Request permission
to come aboard.
Permission granted.
Ready for inspection, Commander.
Now isn't that something that floats.
Sir?
Oh, how many primer coats?
Two.
Two primer coats.
Let's take a look at your engines.
Right.
With your permission, Commander.
Good afternoon, sir.
Engine room, ready for inspection.
Drawdy, motormech 2nd, standing by.
At ease Drawdy.
All three of them work?
Yes, sir.
Show him, Drawdy.
No, no, that won't be necessary,
Mr. Kennedy. I take a man's word.
Good afternoon, sir. Crew's
compartment ready for inspection.
Harris, Gunner's Mate 2nd,
standing by.
Good afternoon!
Somebody's kid sister?
Sorry, sir.
He's very sorry, sir.
Oh, no, no. Don't apologize... the most
seaworthy thing I've seen on this boat.
Good afternoon, sir.
Galley ready for inspection.
Mauer, seaman 1st,
standing by, sir.
Mauer.
Galley, clean, well ordered.
Is there any hot food?
Yes, sir.
Good.
Hot food?
Peanut butter on toast!
Commander!
Yes, lieutenant.
I just wondered how you felt
about the inspection, sir?
How am I suppose to feel?
Well, the men worked hard to
get the boat in shape, sir,
I thought the word of
encouragement would be in order.
I don't hand out pats on the back
for a job I expect a man to do
in the normal performance
of his duty.
I thought that was clear.
My men aren't looking for
pats on the back, Commander,
they are just lookin' for a
little credit for a job well done.
I'm not a book keeper Mr. Kennedy,
I don't dabble in debits or credits.
I'm a Naval officer and I run a torp
ship, I expect you do the same.
Your boat is ready for test run.
Carry on. That's all lieutenent.
Wanna thank you men for
doing a good job.
Damn good job!
Engines check out, okay here, Drawdy.
Thank you, sir!
Everything all right with you, Len?
No complaints.
She runs like the Queen Mary.
Okay, prepare for shakedown drill.
General quarters.
Alright, general quarters! Man your
battle stations! - General quarters!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
Number one, .50 mag,
manned and ready, sir!
Very well!
Go!
Aft .50, manned and ready, sir!
Right! Very well!
Twenty millimeter,
manned and ready, sir!
Very well!
What's your time?
Minute, 10 seconds.
They're 10 seconds
faster we were last time!
Secure general quarters.
Secure general quarters.
Well, what do you think?
Yeah, let's take a
practice running that.
Full speed ahead.
Sylicillars good.
We're about 1500 out.
We'll close to a thousand.
Hey, watch it!
Stand by to fire.
Thousand.
All right!
Fire one.
Fire two.
Right on it.
What's their hurry?
I don't know.
Let's find out.
Alright, make her fast, Harris.
Mr. Kennedy.
Yes, sir.
Today they teach you to manouver
like that at Melwill or...
is that something
you picked up at Cape Cod?
Lieutenat, we like these boats
pretty much just the way they are.
So don't you take it
upon yourself to
change the design of them
by playing billiards
with those other boats out there.
Yes, sir.
Man sure rides your back.
Too bad he doesn't directs some of
that tension towards the enemy.
War would be over sooner.
Well, I guess, I did
come in a little fast.
Drawdy.
Those engines still check out okay?
Yes sir, but there is one thing.
What's that?
Those engines are pretty tired, reverse
them at high speed, they could stall.
You'd wind up on the beach.
Alright, thanks Drawdy.
I'll keep it in mind.
Yes, sir.
How are you, Jack?
How did it go?
Fine, real fine.
Your boat looks good, Jack.
Well ,I got a good crew.
Oh, don't be modest, we got a
briefing session in 15 minutes.
Fifteen minutes? That hardly
gives me time to refuel.
You won't finish refueling
'til after dark.
It's only two o'clock.
You're last in line.
First come, first served.
Oh, yes.
You sure you don't want
that engeneering job?
Yes, I'm sure.
I'm sure.
Hi John.
Jack.
Oh, John. You get those
chocolate bars I asked for?
Yeah, full box of 24. I'll
send them down the boat, okay?
Yeah, thanks.
Hey Jack!
Oh yeah.
- Leonard?
That's three dollars you owe me.
With that sweet of the yours Jack, I'm
affraid you'll never make ends meet.
Well, I guess we are all here.
This briefing is mainly
for the new skippers.
I'm sure you know them by now
Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Libnow,
Mr. Edwards, Mr. Fallow.
Thank you!
To begin with I don't know how long
we'll be operating out of here.
Task Force 31 has made
landings on Rendova.
Here. As soon as the island's
secured, we'll move up.
Until that time, the new skippers
will conduct test runs only.
Unless, of course one of the
coastwatchers turns up something.
For the benefit of the new officers,
that's our local spy setup.
There are Australian volunteers
mainly and they do a great job.
They are located in a
lot of these islands
reporting to us on Japanese
troop movements, shipping,
anything that'll do us any good.
Yeoman!
Pass out those orders.
Read them carefully gentlemen,
then I'll answer your questions.
Welcome to the South Pacific, Rogers.
I didn't know you're in
any of this sort of thing.
Oh, believe me, Mr. Kennedy, I
had it all set up. Locked in.
Recruiting duty in Columbus, Ohio, with
sea pay. Somebody blew the whistle.
I tell you, it must been Roosevelt
or somebody way up. Really!
I had it all locked in.
You know, one of these days,
he's gonna talk himself right
into the Japanese Imperial staff.
Prairie Dog, Prairie Dog, this
is GSE, I have your message
and you're related to Tulagi.
GSE out!
Hello KEN. KEN this is GSE. From Prairie
Dog I have a relay of message to Tulagi.
Priority urgent, message follows:
Prairie Dog . Urgent request.
At least two.
I repeat, two PT's. Cover force,
withdrawal his force by two LCVP's
at Baker 91, I repeat, Baker 91.
This is KEN. This is KEN.
Baker 91 will comply. Over.
Thank you KEN, GSE out.
Emergency rescue, sir.
What can we put in the water?
I can give you a note in the bottle.
I got five boats, two on dry dock,
two for night patrol and the 109.
Thank you, sir!
Oh why, what happened?
Somebody hit the fan? Cluster!
Rescue mission.
Can you get underway?
For a few feet. We've only got enough
gas for a test run. Why, what's up?
It'll have to do.
Marine paratroop battalion
hitch was
filter cover for a real
thing at Buganville.
To make it look big, they were
ordered to split into patrols
and raise scatter hell.
Alright Lenny, wind them up.
Alright.
One of those patrols is trapped
in the North end of the island.
We'll have to get them of
the beach. Here is your position.
What do you want me to do?
Beach it?
No, we have two LCVP's for that. Your
job is to rendezvous and provide cover.
I suppose you know, with that
little of gas we'll never get back.
I'll send you a tow.
That's all I can promise.
That's your best offer,
I'll take it.
- Good luck, Jack!
- Thanks!
Alright! Stand by, hand line.
What are you reading now, Lenny?
About 1800.
You got how many forts, skipper.
We're down to 300 gallons.
Yeah.
Thanks, Drewitch.
VP1. VP1. This is PT109.
Requests your instructions, over.
We're pinned down on the beach!
Need your gun, so we can run for it!
Give me your cover fire, while
you are load and clear, over.
Alright Lenny, I'll take over.
All stations, stand by.
We're moving in.
Commence firing.
Commence firing.
Alright, stand by, Drewitch.
We are isling down.
That's some on the port side!
Right!
That's some on the port side!
That's some on the port side!
Give them a hand with
that cargo net there!
Lean over.
Alright, let's go!
Skipper! Our fuel gages
are bouncing on zero.
Get those men out of the water!
Get that water man aboard.
Get him down below!
All right. Get him around
the other side! Come on!
Water man, help me!
Star, get on that gun!
Mack, over here!
Get those nets up!
Let's get out of here!
We don't stand a chance a hell to
get back to Tulagi unless you find
a gas station out here someplace.
We've had it skipper.
You better read the scales.
At least we are out of range, ha?
Yeah, but the tide is coming in.
Come in PT. Any PT.
This is Hangnail, come in please.
Come in PT. Any PT.
Come in please.
Any PT. Come in. This is Hangnail.
Come in please, come in.
PT, this is Geronimo.
What's your pleasure?
Geronimo, we're dry up the beach.
Can you give us a tow?
That's what we're here for.
Well ,make it fast.
Another two minutes,
those zeroes will be
climbing down our backs.
Where the hell is he?
Hey, Jack!
Up from port bow.
Alright, Lenny, give them
a hand with the bowline.
Right.
Okay, haul away.
Lenny.
Yeah.
Keep the crew in
general quarters,
and let Tulagi know
what's going on.
Okay.
How you doin'?
Fine, all I need are couple of
aspirines and a band-aid.
How you doin' Drawdy?
Not to good, sir.
Drewitch.
We're gonna be replaced Mr. Kennedy?
Yeah.
Don't do that to us.
I mean, just sittin' in the hospital
with them bombs comin' down...
Wanna trade places?
That's a good idea,
let him sit in a hospital.
No chance, ha?
I'm affraid not Drewitch.
We'll come and visit you.
I'll bring you over a snack
every now and then.
Don't do us any favours.
Help you guys?
Yeah, we're replacements.
Is the XO aboard?
Be back in couple of minutes.
Come on aboard.
I'm Maguire.
Starkey, Johnston, Zinser.
Hi, I'm McMahon.
Who we replacing?
Couple of guys in Arlington.
A little trouble at Schwartzsell,
nothing serious.
It's just the cook fishin'.
With the hand grenade?
In a war, you don't have time to
sit around like Huckleberry Finn.
Come on, I'll take you down below.
Well, today ain't gonna rain no more,
no more. It ain't gonna rain no more...
How in the world does Harris know
it ain't gonna rain no more?
Wanna hear some news?
The war is over.
No, that happens on Tuesday, or
next week on Tuesday. We're going to
Rendova and Ritchie stays here.
You sure?
I just got the word
from the yeoman upfront.
The way that Japanese flowers
cover that Rendova frozen
you'd think that whole
war was taking place there.
Kirksey my boy, you got
nothing to worry about.
All we get is a Japs, they got Ritchie.
We're gettin' a better deal, believe me.
Is captain...?
Yes, sir.
Come in.
Captain.
Go ahead Commander.
Some of these yeoman can really foul
things up. These orders are, all wrong.
The orders are correct.
You're staying behind.
Look captain, in three weeks,
this'll all be backwash.
You're doing a job here.
Oh, yeah...yeah, That's what
they told me in the last war.
I was in destroyers, you know,
greyhounds of the fleet...
sure, tied up to a pier in Bayonne,
New Jersey for the duration.
I know, I read your service record.
Oh, than you also know, I've been
passed over twice already.
You're leaving behind
a... could have began.
Look Commander, this
is a different war.
Different breed of fighting men,
like these PT boys.
The trouble is, you've never made
an effort to understand them,
I know they don't follow Navy regs.
Why should they? Fighting destroyers
from a piece of plywood.
Yes, yes, I suppose that's
what's eating me. Them in combat!
I've been in this Navy 25 years, I've
never been close enough to the enemy
to shake a fist at him!
Captain, I'm no hero, for all
I know, I may even be a coward.
If I am, I think I could
live with it...but
at least I'd like a
chance to find out.
Booish Pappy?
Wish sombody invent
a middle age war.
You know, I don't get it.
All she asked of you, how'd
you get trapped into this thing?
I have a stepson. He joined up.
Where does that leave me?
Well, I see your point,
but... it's coming with fog.
Can't very well climb up on my son's
knee and ask him about the war.
It wouldn't be dignified.
Skipper, topside!
Snyby.
Yes, sir.
What's the serial number of that Jeep?
I don't know sir.
Find out, write it down.
I want the same Jeep.
Yes, sir.
Rogers.
Yes, sir.
About that mosquito netting,
I want it to arrive intact.
So pack it very carefully.
I'll try sir.
Don't try it. Do it! Because if I get
a bite, somebody's gonna get stung.
Request permission to come aboard.
Permission granted.
Thank you. I'm riding
with you to Rendova.
Oh, are you in charge of the boat, sir?
Naturally.
Welcome aboard, sir.
Thank you!
Is this the way to... Columbus, Ohio?
I can't figure it out Mr. Kennedy,
I wind up in Tulagi,
so I make the best of it by trying
to get to the maintenance officer.
Scuttled, but hazard, he stays behind.
Maybe you're not using
the right kind of juice.
Exactly, maybe I should of
gone to Harvard.
Hahvard.
Yes, sir.
Wind them up!
Stand by to cast off!
Alright, cast off your bowline!
Snyby!
Let's get the hell out of here.
Zero at 5 o'clock, sir!
General quarters,
man your battle stations!
General quarters,
man your battle stations!
Request permission to
stand by to 20 millimeter.
Permission granted.
Thank you.
Engine room.
Stand by! General quarters.
-Two o'clock, sir! -Aft .50, manned and
ready, sir! -2 o'clock, sir! -Very well!
Request permission to
take over your gun.
Come on son, come on,
let me have a crack at him.
Go ahead sir!
Thanks.
You got him, sir!
Yeah.
Good shootin' Commander.
Ah, beginers luck.
Thanks son.
Thanks very much.
Yes, sir!
That was nice shootin' Commander,
let that plane just right.
Oh, thanks Marney.
Oh, I don't know, he just kind of... you
know, slit right into my line of fire.
You must have a lot of gunnery
during the First war, right, sir?
Oh, nah, we can let it go...that!
Yes, sir!
Skipper!
Tryin' to beat us in.
There goes our sack time.
Not again.
Stand by your bowline.
Remember what Drawdy said
about those engines, skipper.
Skipper! Skipper!
Can't reverse!
Clear the decks!
Jack, there is a boat coming out!
I see it, I see it.
Get a line over to those
men in the water!
Get your spring lines over!
Marney, get the forward spring line!
Harris, get the aft spring line!
Starkey, fend her!
Ah, that tears it.
Harris, throw up the spring line!
Grab a line chief.
Gang way.
Alright, throw a jiggen fly, get
those men out of the water!
Mauer, give them a hand.
Call in your bowline!
Mr. Kennedy.
Yes, sir!
Did you arrange this landing
for my benefit
or do you always
entering the port like this?
No sir, I tried to reverse my engines,
they're too fast to speed.
I'll put it on my report.
Just make sure it jabs with
my report Mr. Kennedy!
Yes, sir!
Free, Jack, take her home.
Well, I don't imagine I'm very
popular with the seabee's right now.
Hello Jack.
- How are you?
Hey!
When did you come in?
Couple a days ago. Lenny,
welcome to your new home.
Thank you, sir!
That was a very impressive landing.
It didn't impress Ritchie.
He's a... a very sentimental man,
where's his boats are concerned.
Well, it's a job.
I can understand that.
I'm glad you do.
You both are wanted up at the
operations right away. Come on.
What's up?
Briefing, something big,
I think.
You'll be assigned to Branninghan's
group for the time being.
Squadron Commander?
Yeah, and a damn good one.
Hey, how come they call this
place, Todd city?
Leon Todd Jr., first PT man
killed at Rendova.
This way Jack.
This is it!
Jack, I'm leaving on a special
assignment for a few days,
I'll see you when I get back, ha?
Well, good luck, sir.
- You too.
And don't worry about
wrecking that shed.
You're not the first one.
We have message from CTF31.
We gotta summarize.
The strong chance the Express
may run tonight.
That means the group of destroyers,
plus heavy barge traffic.
Their mission is to land troops
and supplies at Vella.
My instructions are to
use every available PT.
Four of our boats have radar.
The form of division are on
each of those four boats.
Cookman, your group will patrol
south Ferguson Passage.
Scott, your area is east
of Makuti island.
Burnssen, your group will patrol
opposite Guattari village.
My group will be farthest up the strait,
opposite the village of Vanga Vanga.
This should be enough to stop any
move to Villa through Blackett strait.
We're on condition Red, sir.
Boat captains, man your boats.
Aah! Watch the kidneys,
they only issue two.
Sorry, fella, I didn't see you.
Jack!
Hey, Barney, where did you come from?
Guadalcanal, I got my
boat shot off under me.
What are you doing here?
Fighting the enemy.
I got to get to my boat,
I'll see you later.
Yeah, okay, Jack, Oh, wait,
listen. Listen, Jack!
Stand by, engine room!
Where the hell is the skipper?
He's on his way.
Stand by that dock, right Mac!
Get ready to cast off!
Your engines all right down there?
What happened down there?
Harris, two o'clock!
Hey skipper, the water jackets are
punctured, you can't run the engines.
Mauer, Maguire, forget those lines,
the engines are dead.
Harris, 9 o'clock.
Our position on Vanga Vanga
should be a very busy one.
If their destroyers try to cross
Blackett strait,
be sure your fisher ready to fire.
If they try to go north
around Kolembangara,
we have Burke's destroyers
and Kelly's PT's.
Lieutenant Branninghan.
What is it, Mr. Ross?
I'm without an assignment, if anybody
could use an extra hand, I'm available.
Well?
I'm putting on, a 37 mm, you
can have a go work with them.
I'll take it.
Where did you get a 37 mm, lieutenent?
I find it laying around Tulagi,
I figured it'll give us a little
added fire power.
Alright, Ross, you're on the 109.
That's it, monitor regular channels,
maintaine radio silence,
good luck, get going.
Didn't you had enough action
for one day, Barney?
Tend to stay safe on that island,
but bombs keep falling on it.
I'd rather had a boat under me.
You can operate a 37 mm?
Well, I'm pretty quick to learn.
Well, now we got a little class
on this two by four.
What about the mounting, sir?
Lash it to the planks for now,
we'll bolt it on later.
Yes, skipper!
Will you tell me what we're
doing with an anti-tank gun
on the PT boat.
Skipper would mount a tank if
he could find one.
All safe?
Take over Lenny.
I'm not too crazy about having
him around.
It's bad luck having a
stranger aboard.
Don't be silly, that's for a ships
like Moby Dick, not this one.
You'll have to show me how a 37 works.
I have a small confession Barney,
we'll learn together.
Hey, Mac.
Yeah, Andy.
Will you take care of my things?
What things?
What are you talking about?
My things, whatever belongs to me.
Look, when we get back,
you better sack in for a while.
I'm not coming back.
Bestow it!
Maguire, I'm gonna get killed!
Listen, last two boats I was on,
there was always a guy who thought
is was gonna get his.
They knew too?
They knew nothing.
No one died in on those boats.
Hey, skipper.
Spare a minute?
Sure, what is it?
I think you better talk to Kirksey,
he's pretty they'll gonna
mail him home.
Alright.
Hi, Kirksey.
Mr. Kennedy.
Jarvie?
No sir, thank you, sir!
Maybe I do need a cup, lieutenent.
I don't know what's the matter
with me Mr. Kennedy?
I got this awful feeling I'm
not coming back.
Andy, I don't think there is a
man on this boat
who hasn't had that thought one
time or the other.
You don't understand, Mr. Kennedy.
I don't think it, I know it.
Did you ever have a feeling, ahead
of time, something's gonna happen'
right before dozer?
Yes.
It's like somebody put a cold hand
on my heart, I got chill.
I can't shake it off.
It could happen' Andy, you could die.
That's war,...
and ever I think about that, I try
to remember the odds are on our side.
Yes, sir. But the japs aren't.
You tellin' me I shouldn't worry, sir?
No, you'd be a fool if you did.
Than what can a man do, Mr. Kennedy?
Except pray.
You can do your job.
Like all of us.
See anything?
No, but the PT's should be on
their station now.
They're gonna have a rough time
finding anything out there tonight.
We're on station,
Vanga Vanga on a starboard beam.
Reduce speed to six knots.
Muffle all engines.
Inform the other boats by
blinker light.
Six knots.
Muffle.
Muffle down.
Message from Oak 11, sir!
Reduce speed to six knots.
Muffle all engine.
Thanks Mac.
Lenny.
Engine room, muffle your engines.
Can't see a thing tonight.
I hear we get radar next month.
Yap.
Sure is a lot of
water out there.
That's just the top of it.
You spot the 159, Mauer?
No sir, not now.
She was off the port beam
about 10 minutes ago.
Radar contact.
Bearing 095.
Range 3500.
Must be barges close to the beach.
I just recieved orders from Oak Zero,
patrol south to a Wana Wana.
I don't know exactly where that is.
Lenny, check the chart.
Ship at two o'clock!
Somebody, somebody!
Help!
- Anybody below?
I don't know, sir!
Give Mauer a hand,
look for survivors.
Yes, sir!
Mauer.
Haul away!
Pappy, Pappy!
Oh, my God!
Oh, God!
Hey somebody!
Pappy is all burned!
Somebody!
Maguire!
Johnston!
Marney!
Over here!
Johnston!
- Here!
- I'll get him! - Where?
Help me! It's Johnston!
I'm over here!
Help!
Can't feel my feet.
I got him, Buck.
Can you make it?
Johnston!
Can't feel my legs.
Come on Buck, we're almost there.
My leg go away.
Come on!
I'm going back for Bucky.
Mac, give me a hand!
Over here.
Take it easy.
How you doin' Bucky?
Leave me alone!
Come on!
Leave me alone!
Come on, Buck, it isn't far.
Come on!
Bad arm.
Easy.
- Mauer!
For a guy from Boston, you're putting
up, hell of an exibit. Now, come on!
I don't need anybody... help.
Kick!
Kick!
Kick!
I can't...
Come on, kick!
Watch it, skipper!
Mac!
Come on, Buck!
We're here.
Okay, sir!
Watch his leg.
Everybody aboard?
Everybody but Marney and Kirksey.
Mac, take a look at the starboard side.
Yes, sir!
It's my legs, sir, they don't work.
Marney!
Kirksey!
Marney!
Marney!
Marney!
Kirksey!
Kirksey!
Marney!
Marney!
Kirksey!
Kirksey!
Marney!
Marney!
Marney!
Kirksey!
Marney!
Kirksey!
What happened to the 109?
There's been no radio contact since I
ordered them to patrol at Wana Wana.
Maybe operations know something.
Jim. Send this message to
CO pack, Ron Baker on Guadal.
Belived PT 109, lost
night action, 2, August.
Two miles, Northwest, Meressul.
Repeat, Meressul.
Crew of 13.
Request air search earliest possible.
Let captain Saunders release that.
Oh, Evans reported a barge of
fire on oil slick
two miles Southwest of Meressul.
Well, that could be the PT109, maybe
the crew's in the water or the beach.
Let's hope so.
It's a hell of a time to
hitchhike Mr. Ross.
How's he doin' Lenny?
Third degree burns on both
his arms.
Shoulders and his face aren't
much better.
Zinser, how's Johnston?
He's better, sir,
he stopped throwing up.
If they come out here, what are
we gonna do? Fight or surrender?
What are you gonna use to
fight with?
We got 37mm, this tommygun and
some 45's.
That ammo's been wet, suppose
the guns don't fire.
Alright, than we'll throw bullets at
them, but I'm not gonna surrender.
That's all right if they're a handfull,
but what if they send an army out here?
What's the difference who
they send down?
Let's surrender.
We're not good to anybody dead!
I'm not gonna surrender!
Oh, that's okay for you guys,
I got a wife and three kids.
Well, what makes you think you
gonna see them if you surrender?
Knock it off!
Lenny, give me that map.
If this thing didn't go on,
we'll float right down to their laps.
Question is: which island?
You're not thinking swimming
over there, are you?
I'm open to suggestion Lenny.
You got any better ones?
Most of those islands are held
by the enemy.
You know Kolembangara is.
We know Guizo is.
Yeah, here's one.
Plum pudding.
About, three and a half miles.
I think we can make it.
Take us about four hours.
It's our best bet.
- If it isn't?
Sir, some of these men don't
swimm to well.
How far did you say
that island was?
Don't worry Bucky.
We'll make it.
You get 11 men in the water,
we'll be pretty spread out, sir.
We'll lash the planks together.
I don't think Pappy can make it.
I'll take care of Pappy,
you stay with the other men.
Come on, let's go.
Maguire, take that bowliner,
lash'em to the plank.
Yes, sir!
You think we're gonna make it,
don't you sir?
Take bets on it Bucky, either
you're winner or don't pay off.
That's it Pappy, put your feet
on here! Atta boy!
Lift them up, up, Pappy.
Okay, everybody get their shoes
off and tie 'em to the plank.
Put 'em later on.
You got Pappy?
Just easy, Johnston.
Watch your feet.
You got 'em?
Bring him on down here.
Easy, easy on those burns.
You all right Pappy?
Four miles are long way.
It's only three inches on the
chart, Bucky.
Skipper!
There she rows.
PWD, PWD, this is GSE.
GSE, this is PWD.
Go ahead.
Last night's fire seems to be small
barge, it's afloat and still visible.
Japanese island patrols are
still active. Out!
Albert, why the hell did you do
that for?
They are heavy.
Who needs them.
You'll find out when that coral
gets to you.
Come on, Johnston.
Hang on there!
We'll have you on that beach
in no time.
How you doin', Pappy?
Okay, skipper.
Hurry up!
Jap barge.
Oh, my God!
Go further up the rush.
Barney.
You never introduced me to
your friends?
They'll be back.
Wonderful.
Our boat should be coming through
here tonight.
Well, not neccessarily, he can
just woke up to Guizo strait.
Well, then they have to go
out this way.
Well, if I can go out there with
a lantern, we can flag 'em down.
What, you went nuts. You'll have
to check water all night long.
There is a reef out there.
I can walk part of the way.
Well, you'll never come back, buddy.
Well, I can't send for room service!
How you doin' Pappy?
Fine, I just don't... look so good,
that's all.
You know, maybe some oil from those
coconuts might help those burns.
Yeah.
How about a signal fire, sir,
just in case of the rescue party?
Lit a fire, we'll be
rescued in ten minutes...
...by the Japanese.
They are all around us, Bucky.
It's kind a like a bunch of burglars
breaking into a police station,
...it tends to be awkward.
Some of the men are to hold down those
coconuts. Try the oil on these burns!
Oak leaf 1, this is Blue Jay.
We've spotted wreckage, mid channel.
No survivors.
Repeat, no survivors seen.
Out.
Lenny.
Keep lookouts posted all night,
both ends of the island.
Zinser, Mauer, take the first watch.
Good luck!
Ain't that the biggest damn
fool you ever saw?
Sir?
Well, hope our boats come through
Ferguson Passage tonight.
That's where he'll be.
Oak Leaf, this is Tiger Tail Leader,
over.
Tiger Tail Leader,
this is Oak Leaf, over.
I've completed Vella Lavella sweep.
I'm returning home!
Your order, return Ferguson Passage...
for channel is narrow,
visibility low!.
Request permission return
Blackett strait, over.
Permission granted, over.
Roger, Oak Leaf, over and out.
Let's go home,
through Blackett strait.
Making a record of how long
we're stuck here. Notch a day.
Sure you got enough plank?
All right, Starkey?
What's gonna happen' to us,
Mr. Thom?
We're just gonna sit out here and die?
Skipper will turn up something.
Skipper, he's been gone 10 hours!
Where do they think we are?
Down the ships store or AWOL?
We didn't get mislay, we're here!
I wish I co... I wish I could do
something to get their minds off this.
Well, maybe they might enjoy, snooker
or tea dance or something like that.
That's what we're really
set out for, are we Lenny?
Mr. Thom, Mr. Ross!
He's back!
Hey, Thom, give me a hand!
Move him off the beach.
Take it easy!
They didn't come.
All I saw was a Jap barge.
Barney, you go out tonight.
Jack, I'm with you, you know that,
so is everybody else.
If something doesn't happen'
pretty soon, we're gonna tap out.
What do you mean?
Well, a... there's a Japanese
held island right over there.
Yeah...?
Some of the men feel it's better
than nothing.
- It means giving up!
It means giving up, alive!
- Nobody's giving up!
Nobody wants to give up, Jack.
- Nobody's going to!
We're going to get out of here!
Alright, we'll wait and see.
- Get some rest!
You're going out!
Tonight!
Good morning, sir!
Good morning.
Well?
No sign of them, sir.
We patroled all night.
Where?
Blackett strait.
Is that the only place they could be?
You might as well face it,
Commander, the 109 is gone.
Just a minute, you! You think I worry
too much about those boats, don't you?
No, but that's what you're thinking.
So are lot of other people
around here.
Well, let me tell you
something Mister...
I worry about those boats, yes,
and for one reason.
Those boats have a deck on 'em,
and men stand on those decks.
That's why I won't give up the 109.
She had men on her deck.
I don't want the deck back, I want
the men that were standing on it.
That's the only thing that matters
in this whole big hairy world!
And don't you ever give me any
of your smart mouth again!
You wanna put a high gloss
on these please, porter?
Wake my friend when he gets
to Hyenas port.
Good luck, Mr. Ross.
Well, there is nothing I got
to be affraid off.
Right Mac?
Right, sir!
Right.
It looks is if they're checking
island by island.
Thanks Zinser.
If they check this island,
we'll have to take another swimm.
Either that, or we'll make a stand here.
It's in the dozen men we
kill 'em all, they send 500 more?
Pappy.
You put a little more that
stuff on you.
Skipper.
Doesn't do any good!
Skipper!
Skipper, he's here.
Watch it, Mac.
Get something.
I'm sorry, Jack.
I draw a blank.
How do you feel?
Okay, I reseted a while
on that... little island.
Alright, let's start lashing our gear
together, we're going to Olasana.
Look, skipper, I can't walk on anymore
reef, my feet are already cut to the bone.
I won't be able to make Olasana.
You're gonna have to make it.
Why move at all? At least we know
there are no Japs here.
We also know there is no food here.
Well, we'll get food one
this times, it'll be sukiyaki.
At least out there we'll be
close to our boats.
They should be coming
through tonight.
The odds are on our side.
Boy, you kill me.
You really do!
Here we are, beat and burn
and given up for dead,
living on green coconuts and no
water in the middle of 1500
Japanese soldiers and you decide
the odds are with us!
It's a flaw in my character.
Almost there, Pappy.
All right.
We'll rest here a while.
They almost got me iron
for food and water.
Lenny, you take Harris... Mauer,
to the north end.
I'll take the others to the south.
PWD, PWD, this is GSE.
This is PWD, go ahead GSE.
Further report on four deck of 109.
It is grounded on reef...
at south Gross island. I'll repeat that.
Four deck 109, grounded on reef...
at south Gross island.
Out.
PWD acknowledges.
Out.
Sir, how would you like
that coastwatchers job.
Just sitting on the cliff with
nothing to do but staring the space.
Snyby, some men fight a war
from the turret of the 16-inch gun.
Other guys sweat it out
at the office...or,
or on top the the hill on some
God forsaken island.
It doesn't mean their job is any easier.
Evans is all alone on that island.
If an enemy patrol spots him...
that's the way he's gonna die... alone!
Remember that.
Yes, sir!
Mr. Thom!
Yap?
There's a canoe beach down there.
Hey, I think I found the owners.
Take it easy.
Hold it,
hold it.
Put your guns down.
We're Americans.
They don't look too friendly.
As long as they have those rifles!
That's an open question.
Tell you one thing:
those are Japanese rifles.
Let's do something,
I don't trust them.
Don't trust them or those rifles.
Who are they, Lenny?
I don't know.
Mr. Kennedy, those are
Japanese rifles.
You speak English?
You know Rendova?
There must be some way to get
through to them.
Try 'em at latin, Jack.
You take a message to Rendova?
What are you gonna use?
I'll find something.
Why don't we jump them, sir?
We can get the rifles and a canoe.
Yeah... and deliver
the message ourselves.
No, wait!
What about this, Jack?
It's smooth and everything.
Open it up!
I'm a friend of... Johnny Carrey.
You know Johnny Carrey?
Rendova.
Johnny Carrey.
This could backfire, you know?
It could.
Falls in a wrong hands,
it's like taking out an add.
Time is running short on us, Barney.
There, how's that?
NATIVE KNOWS POS'IT... HE CAN PILOT...
Well, it might do it.
You take to Rendova.
Rendova.
You think they'll deliver it?
In my opinion,
I think they'll eat it.
Couple of guys like that
you send to Rendova,
they're level to show up in Seattle.
That's all right. Last I heard,
Seattle was on our side, too.
Jack!
Take a look at this.
That's not even the way to Seattle.
Any luck, skipper?
No, no luck Zinser.
Ain't no food, there ain't no
water on any of these islands.
I don't know about the brass,
but I made my last swimm.
If I'm gonna die,
I'll do it my way.
Maybe we should of stayed on the
four-deck. Somebody might of seen us.
Don't start tellin' us
what we should of done.
You think we're better of here?
I think somebody could of guess
we got hit and had to abandon ship.
We did abandon ship,
and abandoned us.
Why do you have argue
about every damn little detail?
We wound up in the water.
PWD this is GSE, calling.
PWD this is GSE, calling.
This is PWD,
go ahead GSE.
I anticipate moving the
station tomorrow...
I can't get a good view
of Ferguson Passage...
or the west side of Blackett strait.
New position for station will be DOG34.
I repeat, DOG34. Final advise A.M.! Over.
PWD acknowledges and out.
Thank you PWD, GSE out.
What good is it?
What good is it?
Take it easy.
What good is the damn thing?
Who we gonna wave it at, ha?
Nobody, that's who. Nobody.
We struck out, Mac.
Admit it!
Look, we still have something
work aforce: there's two natives.
Oh, they never got through.
How do you know they didn't?
Well, they didn't.
It's as simple as that.
You don't have to pull rank
on me Mr. Kennedy.
We're not getting out of here
and I know it!
Well, you don't believe it!
Neither does anybody else! Ask 'em!
Mac.
I don't know, sir!
Zinser.
It's getting, so I really
don't care, Mr. Kennedy.
Well, you're gonna start right now!
All of us are.
We're getting out of here,
one way or the other.
What about the natives?
If the natives don't do it,
we'll do it another way.
But we're getting out of here
if we have to get in the water
and drag this damned island
back with us!
Mr. Thom, Mr. Thom, there's a canoe
full of natives off the beach.
Mr. Kennedy.
Mr. Kennedy.
I am Kennedy.
Mr. Kennedy. I'm Benjamin Kevu.
I have a letter for you.
From an Australian coastwatcher
named Evans, he got the coconut.
In His Majesty's service,
senior officer, Olasana island.

Just learned of your
presence on Olasana.
I strongly advise you return
here in this canoe,

be on radio communication...
with authorities at Rendova,
where we can finalize plans to
collect balance of your party.
A. R. Evans.
I suggest we leave as soon as
possible. Enemy patrols erect.
Alright, keep the men posted
undercover till I get back.
If he just get pass those patrols.
what is it Kevu?
Japanese plane.
Please stay undercover.
Hello, I'm Reg Evans,
very glad you made it.
Jack Kennedy, glad to be here.
Set a rendezvous for the
PT at Partpyren island.
In the meantime, we'll send you
directly to Rendova.
They'll never get pass those reefs,
unless I take them through.
Yes, I totally agree.
Alright, you make the rendezvous
at Partpyren island at 0200 hours.
PT will approach North by Northwest.
Fire four identification shots.
Well, I only have three rounds.
Use this.
Thank you.
Like to give you a cup of tea,
but you don't have the time.
I am very grateful.
Glad to help Kennedy, good luck.
Barney.
Hey Lenny.
Barney.
Pappy, we're getting you home.
Hello skipper.
Hey skipper, you made it!
Hey bartender, don't give
my friend another drink,
you'll have to send him
home in a cast.
Hey old buddy. We really won this
poor game. We are on our way home.
Home?
That's right Jack, it's Navy custom.
You lose a boat...
you rate a State side leave.
That sounds great.
I'd like that.
You're going, aren't you?
Jack, you rated.
We all do.
I know.
Then why not take it if you
are entitled?
Nobody owns me anything, Barney.
The boats gone, two men, took me
a long time to get out here
I'd like to stick around a while.
Can you get me another one?
Come.
Well, Mr. Kennedy, could I talk
to you a minute?
Sure, come on in Albert.
Alone, sir.
Alright.
Oh, stay here Jack.
Sir!
Give me a hand.
Sure, Barney.
Take it easy.
Come in Albert, wanna cup of coffee?
No, thank you, sir.
Sit down.
- Thank you.
I just came in to say...
...well, I want to
apologize Mr. Kennedy.
For what?
Throwing that lantern around
and poppin' of the way I did.
There's nothing to apologize for.
Yes there is.
You are trying to get us out
of this mess and a...
I start shouting about
how... we won't be coming back.
Havin' a fit all over the place.
I owe you an awful lot, sir and
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.
Albert, if I already get in a jam like
this again, I hope I plunder a men
like you aboard.
Men who aren't afraid to say
what they believe,
even though the odds are against them.
So stay available.
Okay?
Thank you, sir!
Well?
Ask me over to admiral.
Made me skipper of 61.
Great. Watch out for Japanese destroyers.
Hey, skipper!
Bucky.
What boat you draw?
Another old one, ha?
Well, well, what's old Bucky
gonna do with three weeks leave?
Skipper.
Hi, skipper.
We're thinking of you.
Ship wrecked the top of the mog.
Wage one for me.
Thank you, sir.
Johnston.
Thank you, sir.
Bucky.
See you again, Mr. Kennedy.
Take me to the Golden Gate, James.
Don't tell me.
It's true. You're just
lucky, Mr. Kennedy.
Well, if you men hadn't had enough,
you might as well stow your gear.
Drewitch, Drawdy, you wanna help him
fire up the engines and see what we got?
Yes, sir.
Maguire, sir.
Radioman, 2nd.
Mauer, sir.
Seaman, First.
What happened to your leaves?
We decided to save 'em till Christmas.
Besides skipper, you're a...
you're a little on the thin side.
You need my cook.
That's right, you never did
develop that third specialty.
Well, I got one now, sir!
Spam a la Mauer!
Snyby!
Yes, sir!
Fix that barge before
somebody breaks their neck!
Stand by to cast off all lines.
Jockeys, just a bunch of jockeys!
