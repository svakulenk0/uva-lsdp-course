Another medical question perhaps?
No, I was just thinking that you're the most beautiful thing I've ever seen
It must be because you see me in the dark
No, just're beautiful
You need to see where we go.
Sorry, I did not think you care.
No wonder.
I thought you might like.
It could be if you had requested.
Viennese?
Why did not you tell us anything?
- Because I know they had said no, and I know that what I do is good
And what about your command?
Not kill in a war.
It protects many guys who leave the church.

I'm just saying how good I looked in that uniform
You guys all seemed to think that.

Not so good when you have a hole in the front of your jacket
A trigger input, on white.
Arty was wounded in the back, with all its organs and intestines outside front
Unpleasant everywhere
She clung to his uniform for a moment
He was lucky to be dead not to have seen his bloody uniform
Get out of my sight.
What are you? Part mountain goat?
You're going to help Desmond? Or will you leave me stranded?
I'll help you but it will cost you.

A kiss.
That is pure blackmail.

Last step, I will hold you too.
Wait.
You're not going to slap me right? Why I'll fall and take you with me
Kiss me and find out
What?
I must enlist
I can not stay here while they're all going to fight for me.
If you can.

Mom said you came to see here. - Yes.
These three were my best friends.
I grew up with them.
I got into trouble with them I chased girls with them.

I do not want to have to visit my children here.
Dad, me and enlistment in the army
I could not have done differently dad way.
All else is doing.

You may not be able to live with yourself if you go
No, I can not myself if I do not.
I'll be a doctor, that will be my way of service.
And there you are solving everything, but believe that this war will resolve you?
Your ideas?
Well, I know it will be difficult
It will not be difficult, will be impossible.
You know, whatever you have put on the head will never get out of there does not work well
And if somehow survive do not know lucky you will not be giving thanks to God.

Get behind me, out.
Why the hell are you still here?
Above!
Where is Dawson?

Do not touch that rifle sir.
I'm not asking you out.
That's an order from your commander.
Dawson holy God let this nonsense, and resignation.
He refuses to do so and have no choice
To ask for court martial.
And you spend the rest of the war in a military prison.
I can not sir.
The more you want to wait dear?
I think it has already been enough.
Sorry, sometimes men have cold feet
Some men could, but not my Desmond.
You probably think I'm a bastard
Who cares more rules than their men.
May l?
I believe in this book as much as any other man.
But like any other man fights with my conscience but.
What do you do when everything you value is under attack?
I do not know sir.
I can not answer these questions.
But I also feel that my values ​​are under attack.
I do not know why.
I do not care about your principles that the Japanese not
When you see a wounded soldier or attack you?
Hit him with your Bible?
I am ready to give my life for my men.
You do not always win just by giving your life.
Look, you're here because I do not want to see you in a cell.
Declare yourself guilty and have the mercy of the court, and you can go home to celebrate.
Let the brave men win this war
If I do not come, maybe her if
I was not allowed to call you.
I knew it was not your fault.
What have you.
I'm fine, it's fine just had a fight with the walls and lost.
They will send you to prison Desmond
There must be some other way.
I do not know what could be.
I have done everything I have asked me, except everything they've asked me.
And I'm going to court because I do not kill.
You tried, and nobody can say you did.
But you'll be safe in prison.
Perhaps no one - You can not take a girl and play around with it
You do not have to do it, just open your way out.
But I can not do that.
- This is pride, and foolishness.
Do not confuse your will with the Lord.
I am a proud fool.
Maybe I am a proud and silly.
But it will not hold me but I begin to believe what I believe.
Less if you could live with me.
I'll never be the man I want to do to your eyes.
I fell in love with you.
Because you're not like the others.
I need you to.
Do not think for a moment, you disappoint me
I will love you, no matter what.
I do not know what else to do.
He loses no matter what.
They want to plead guilty and disenroll from dishonorable.
Otherwise it will refuse insurance to prison
in any way be called a coward and can not live with that
Thanks Dorothy, if you talk to the

They are still out? - Yes sir.
OK, take this in.

There is only one question that military personnel need to make the accused.
You deny that disobeyed direct orders from Colonel?
Well, you did out?
- No sir I did not.
So because you are competing.
So why is it so important for you to deny a weapon to serve in a combat unit?
Since the Japanese attacked but Harbor, I took staff.
All he knew were angry, unaccommodating.
There were two men in my village.
Declared with biplane which committed suicide for being unable to serve.
I have a job in the firm and I could have taken but that's not right.
It is not right and that another man has to fight and die while I'm at home sitting safe
I need to serve.
I have the energy and passion to serve as a doctor,
right in the middle with the other boys no less danger alone ...
While everyone else is taking life I will be saving her
With the world also turning into 1000 pieces.
I do not dislike put some pieces back again.

Then as a member of the military you know that there are laws here.
I know the law and that the law protects my son, and is marked in our constitution
And I believe in them as it does, and have fought to protect.
At least that's what I think he did because if it was not for that.
So I do not know what the hell is what I was doing Mr.
