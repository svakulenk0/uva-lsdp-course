- Hyah! Hyah!
- This way!
- Hyah! Hyah!
- Move it!
Out of the way!
Get... Get out of the way!
Hyah! Hyah!
Hyah! Hyah!
Hah!
Go! Go!
Almost got him!
- Go! Go!
- Over there!
Quickly!
Hah!
- Hyah!
- Hyah!
Hyah! Hyah!
- Get it!
- Move!
Hah! Hah!
- Hyah! Hyah!
- Hyah! Hyah!
Get it!
You men, go that way.
- Lead on!
- Hyah!
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!
- Hyah! Hyah!
- Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!
Hyah!
Whoa.
Don't come any closer.
I told you to stop.
I'm not a wild boar.
I'm Frederick von Hohenstaufen,
your emperor.
You are Barbarossa?
Is that what they call me here?
Yes. And who are you?
I'm Alberto da Giussano,
son of Giovanni,
Milanese and blacksmith.
Well, blacksmith,
take this dagger.
It'll serve you when you become a man.
- There's the emperor!
- Here he is! Over here!
- Ho!
- We are here, Your Majesty.
: I'm not so sure
this was a good idea.
: Hildegard von Bingen
is a great seer.
They say she can even
see through bodies
and that when she was five years old,
she described perfectly a calf
that was still in its mother's womb.
They write their own music.
The calf was already dead
in the cow's womb.
Why this journey?
My sovereign and yours is here
to seek your counsel.
Tomorrow he marries for the second time.
He wishes to know if...
The wedding is blessed.
Her virgin tree is not ripe yet,
but the roots are strong.
She will bear fruits.
Come closer,
you...
who claim to be
king among the kings.
Is it written somewhere in my destiny
that I will reunite the empire?
Listen to my words.
Frederick of Swabia...
your name...
shall be remembered for centuries.
But beware.
Beware of the water.
Beware of the scythe.
The scythe brings defeat.
The water...
brings death.
Beware of water.
So here she is, the future empress.
I just hope that she can make my cousin
happier than his previous wife,
who was incapable of being loved
and even more incapable of
bearing him any children.
: We all hope so.
And as you most certainly know,
His Majesty has now wished
for an heir for too long.
I'm afraid he's going to have to wait
a bit longer for that.
But he can console himself.
Beatrice brings the whole of Bourgogne
in dowry.
: At least she's prettier
than the last one.
: But she's just
a child. I didn't realize she was so young.
: Well, at least
she will be able to bear children.
Promising indeed, the little French girl.
Apparently, she can even read.
My father is going to kill me.
How are you, Nicola?
Guys, you're all wet.
What have you been up to?
I don't want to talk about it.
Where have you been? Evandro was about
to leave without you.
- I'm sorry, Father. I'm sorry.
- Alberto, let's get going.
We must reach the river before dawn.
I'm sorry, Evandro.
Quickly, give them to me.
Here. Put them with the others.
- The Lodigiani are still sleeping.
- Just as well.
Leave them snoring.
Did you hear that?
Hurry up. Give it here.
Well, well, well!
Look at all these lovely goods.
Check.
what do you want from us?
We're not in Lodigiani territory.
Now you are not.
But earlier tonight,
you crossed through it.
So you have to pay your dues.
Oh, God! Hey!
Here you go.
- Quickly, get them!
- You get that one! I'll get the other!
They got me!
Go! Go, Alberto!
Go! Quick!
Does he know you love him?
What a question. Of course not.
Ranero da Giussano is too shy.
A little bit stupid, I think.
If he waits any longer with all
these men buzzing around you...
Come here.
And you?
No one will ever want me.
But it's better this way.
I could only love a very special man.
Alberto!
Oh, my God.
Oh, dear.
Tessa!
The Milanese don't waste
a single chance
to underline their superiority
over the other cities.
And this dominance worries us,
Your Majesty.
That's why we are here.
The city of Lodi
was always faithful to you.
It now asks its emperor for help.
The Milanese are getting
too big for their boots.
The time has come to remind them
just how sharp the emperor's sword is.
One order from you,
and the army will be ready to move south
within two weeks, Your Highness.
No. No!
No force yet.
Not now.
My lord, if you manage
to dominate the north of Italy,
you'll become the richest
and most powerful sovereign of Europe.
I'll write them a letter.
Call them to order.
You take it to them.
I come in the name of the emperor.
You were warned not to attack Lodi.
Otherwise Milan will be
banned from the empire.
No! You...
Gherardo!
This is our answer.
You've taken one step
too many, consul.
A step you'll regret.
What have you done?
- Ranald, don't go!
- This is madness!
Excellency! Excellency!
Gherardo! Now what?
What do you propose we do?
Let's assemble the army.
We will attack Lodi.
Goodness.
Alberto.
Alberto da Giussano,
son of a blacksmith.
This wasn't part
of our agreement, was it?
We've done it, Alberto!
We've won!
Lodi has paid for its arrogance.
Huh? You're back already?
Already? You must be joking, brother.
You have slept for four days.
Lodi has been defeated.
We made them pay for their arrogance.
Come with us. We're celebrating outside.
Come outside.
- Come on! Let's go.
- Come along! Come along!
They're ready.
You had no other choice, my lord.
It's almost as if they're trying
to force me to go to war,
and all I want is peace.
I know, Frederick, but at this point,
you have no choice but to go down to Italy.
The Milanese want independence,
but you dream of the glory
of the universal empire.
Destroy them.
Destroy Milan, my lord.
Someone told me a prophecy once,
just before we got married.
It was about a scythe and water.
Scythe meant defeat.
The water meant death.
Was it prophecy or witchcraft?
I have a prophecy for you too.
As a queen, I foresee without any doubt
that you will come back
victorious from Italy.
And as your woman,
I foresee that you
will miss me terribly.
Whoa!
The dogs are restless.
They're afraid of thunder.
They are not afraid
of thunder, Father.
Someone is out there.
Oh, my God! It's you!
You frightened me.
What on earth are you doing out there
in this weather?
I want to talk to you. Alone.
What...
Well? I'm listening.
I'm heading north to Barbarossa's camp.
You tell me things I already know.
Yes, the, uh... The fact is...
There are two females in this home.
For which have you come?
I'm asking for the hand
of your daughter Tessa.
Well. Tessa...
Huh.
Tessa is in age for a husband.
You are looking for a wife.
It's a start.
Maybe a good one.
Then you'll speak to her?
Yeah, yeah.
I'll tell her your intention.
I have everything planned.
Understood.
Until my return.
Hyah!
Whoa.
We are finally here.
That's the part of Italy
that has to be conquered if you want
to reach Sicily, Your Highness.
What about Rome?
It's right in the middle.
It's not going to be that easy.
Rome is weak and sick.
You just have to wait a little more.
How long?
That avid and stubborn Englishman
that took on the name of Pope Adrian IV
has one foot in the grave already.
Our cardinals tell me that his successor
will be much more malleable.
Soon, very soon you will be able to sit
on the throne that belonged to Charlemagne.
Let's go.
Gotcha!
Siniscalco Barozzi,
he came to our house last night.
He asked for the hand
of my sister, Tessa.
Barozzi's a worm.
Barozzi will never take
my sister to the altar.
And how can you be so sure?
Well, I can...
I can feel it.
So what they say is... is true.
You are sort of a witch.
No. Wait.
Wait!
I brought you something.
Wait. Wait.
With this spoon, I'll take care of you
for the rest of my life.
With this dagger, I'll defend you
at the cost of my life.
what? What?
Hey. What's wrong?
Hey!
Damn it!
Oh, this damn thing.
: Eleonora. Hey.
Are you sleeping?
No.
I wanted to show you something.
Look.
He finally made up his mind?
Ranero gave me the pledge.
Don't tell our father.
He keeps telling me that Siniscalco Barozzi
is an eligible bachelor
and that one day he
may even be a consul.
Our father would never have
to sleep in the same bed
with Siniscalco Barozzi.
Follow your heart, Tessa.
You must follow your heart.
Hey! Get some sleep, you two!
Tomorrow is another day.
My heart has already decided.
So this is the way it must be.
Hyah! Hyah!
Ho. Ho.
My God.
: You may go in.
I'm to confer directly
with the emperor.
I'm afraid you'll have to content yourself
with conferring with me.
I bring Milan's oath of allegiance.
Milan is a city with a short memory.
- I don't understand.
- You do understand.
You were there too
when that Milanese consul of yours trampled
on the imperial seal.
I, Ranald of Dassel, was humiliated,
made fun of, beaten by your rabble.
How dare you?
I have also come to apologize.
There is no more time for words.
Go back to your consuls and tell them
the emperor is coming
and that this is not going
to be a courtesy visit.
Listen. Listen to me.
There are many noblemen in Milan
who are favorable to the emperor.
There is nothing more
you can do, Barozzi.
This stays here.
Ah.
It's true. I am scared.
I am scared
because I have seen with my own eyes
the power of the German army.
Their tents covered the entire plain.
And they have so many war machines...
that our whole square
could not contain them.
For the love of reason, I implore you,
let us surrender.
Surrender!
No surrender. We will fight!
Soon, Barbarossa's army
will be at the gates.
You can count the days
to the destruction of Milan
on the fingers of one hand.
Every time we come here,
they build a bridge for us
that is stronger than before.
People of Verona respect
tradition, Your Majesty.
They know that by ancient custom,
when a German king crosses
their land, it is their duty
to build a boat bridge
north of the city.
And that's why we respect them.
- Your Majesty!
- What's going on?
Watch out! Watch out for the logs!
Stop! Stop!
Go past! Go past!
The rope! Tie the rope!
Tie the rope!
Help me!
It's a trap! It's a trap!
Fall back!
- The horses! Save the horses!
- The Veronese have betrayed us!
Hyah! Hyah!
No, Your Majesty!
Remember the prophecy!
Remember the prophecy!
Water brings death!
Help your emperor, goddamn you!
- Go!
- Save the emperor!
Tie the ropes!
Help him!
Take the rope!
- He's gone under!
- Dive down.
Look for the emperor!
No.
Find him!
Dive! Dive! Dive!
God, no!
Give me your hand, Emperor!
what you have done
is very serious indeed.
You have allied yourself
with Milan against the empire.
You have caused the death
of many German soldiers.
You have not respected the tradition
that has saved Verona
from destruction until today.
Why? Why?
Today is an important day.
I want you to remember one thing.
You can only betray your emperor once.
I am as cruel...
as God is full of mercy.
: Alberto!
Alberto!
Barbarossa has destroyed
the city of Brescia.
They say there are over 1,000 dead.
How do you know?
Have you had another one
of your visions?
What do you want us to do?
Surrender to the Germans?
What difference would it make, right?
Slaves we were, and
slaves we'd still be.
We don't want to be slaves anymore.
Is it worth fighting a battle
that is already lost to begin with?
That's enough, woman.
We all have to do our duty.
Ours is to fight to defend the city!
Yours is to stay home and wait
for your man to return!
If you have one.
Don't you ever talk to
her like that again. Ever.
That's enough, Alberto.
Alberto!
That's enough.
: There they are.
Wonderful.
I wonder how many cities
we have to destroy
before they come to their senses.
Just one more, Sire.
Destroy Milan and all the other cities
will bleat like frightened sheep,
wanting only to obey their shepherd.
Milan. Milan.
Milan.
The city of Parma greets the emperor.
The city of Cremona greets the emperor.
The city of Padua greets the emperor.
The city of Ferrara
greets the emperor.
I wonder what's stronger
in these people:
The will to fight for the empire
or to contribute
to the destruction of Milan?
They're sheep, Ranald.
They don't need to think.
They just need to obey the emperor.
Did you hear that?
It is like the sound of thunder.
But it's not thunder.
It's like...
Over there! Look! Over there!
- Barbarossa!
- Barbarossa!
Barbarossa! Barbarossa!
Barbarossa!
Barbarossa!
Move in! Move in!
Come on! Hurry! Move!
Get the gate closed! Come on!
Oh, God.
I've never seen such a large army.
Alberto, let's go.
Alberto!
Alberto, come on! Hurry up!
Hurry up! Come on!
What's wrong?
Don't let your brothers be chosen.
I saw the arrows.
- Look...
- You must prevent this.
The Germans are over there.
There's plenty of arrows around.
What are you talking about?
The arrows I saw were not German.
: We're ready to move
at sunrise.
How many of these war machines
do we have?
About 100, Your Majesty.
Unfortunately, the guard towers
are out of range.
Can we not move them closer?
We can't, Majesty.
The Milanese have built a defensive ditch
along this line.
Our war machines cannot move
beyond this point.
Smart.
Any advice?
I say we concentrate the fire
of our crossbowmen on the walls...
to let our men
fill the ditch with earth.
- I agree.
- Yes, a very good idea.
The Milanese feel secure
inside the city walls.
We'll keep them there.
We'll block all the gates.
We'll starve them.
And if they don't surrender...
the city will be a grave.
: Push! Push!
Quickly! Quickly!
Place the bases!
They're getting ready to attack.
: Take cover!
: Archers, loose!
Take cover!
- Shoot!
- Get down! Cover!
: Barrels into the water!
- Take your positions!
- Open the ramp for the barrels!
Quickly! Quickly!
Pass those barrels!
Keep them moving!
Watch out!
They're putting barrels into the river.
To make a passage for the towers.
Quickly! Quickly!
Move these barrels!
: Ballast one, fire!
- Aim!
- Fire!
Fire!
Fire!
Leave them no rest.
Deprive them of food and sleep.
Their will to fight
will diminish day by day.
Fire!
- Fire!
- Fire!
Fire!
Fire!
And reload!
Fire!
- Fire!
- Fire!
- Fire!
- Fire!
Get out of here! Quickly!
- Fire!
- Fire!
Fire!
- Fire!
- Fire!
Come on! Move! Move!
Come on!
To the walls!
Faster! Faster!
Push!
Push with all you've got! Come on!
Fire!
Get down!
Cover! Faster!
Come on!
Run! Come on!
Run! Quickly!
We'll be slaughtered!
Stop! Stop! Here!
Stop! Let's line it up!
Bring stones!
Faster! Faster! Come on!
Past the moat!
Fifty yards beyond the walls!
Ready?
Fire!
Fire!
Listen.
We need some volunteers.
One man per family
to go outside the walls
and stock up on food.
Who will go?
You. You. Ah, good.
Yes.
Young Ranero da Giussano's arm
hasn't moved.
Or perhaps I didn't notice.
Leave him alone, Barozzi.
His brother Otto and I are here.
Choose one of us.
Very well.
Since your brother doesn't,
shall we say, feel up to it,
you will go.
No.
Let no one say...
that Ranero da Giussano was afraid.
He said one person per family.
Drop it.
No, no.
Why prevent a brave young man
from proving his courage?
Be at the St. Ambrogio grate
in half an hour. You leave from there.
Go to the walls!
Don't go without a weapon!
Get your weapons!
- Why'd you have to get...
- Don't tell me what to do!
Barozzi's already picked me!
You wait here!
Close the gate.
Come back safe.
- Fire!
- Fire!
- Fire!
- Fire!
- Fire!
- Fire!
Fire!
Tessa. They should have been
back long before now.
I fear the worst.
Holy Mother, I pray nothing
has happened to them.
No matter what has happened, I want
you to know that I'll look after you.
You'll never be alone.
Don't touch me!
I don't need you.
I've promised my heart
to Ranero da Giussano,
and that's the way it's going to be.
And if he doesn't return,
I'd rather die than be with you.
Listen.
The Germans have stopped firing.
- Quick!
- What is it?
The Germans are attacking!
Tessa. Tess... Tessa!
Keep pushing!
The Germans are attacking.
There are men tied to the towers.
They're approaching!
Can't you see them?
They've tied our men to the towers!
- Look what they've done. It's unbelievable.
- What are you waiting for? Fire!
Don't think about us!
: Shoot! Shoot!
: Shoot! Shoot!
Alberto, tell me
what you want me to do.
Give them the order to shoot
before it's too late!
No, Barozzi!
We cannot kill our citizens!
: You have to save Milan!
- Alberto!
- I told you, I don't know!
: What's that?
There's something on the towers!
Antonia, no, don't look!
: Shoot! Shoot!
- Get them out of here! Get rid of them! Out!
- No!
You can't stay here!
You can't do it! I beg you, don't do it!
Please! I beg you! You can't do it!
We can't shoot our own men.
We just can't.
No! No!
Shoot us! Shoot us!
- No, no! Don't do it!
- Please!
Please!
I'll shoot!
Shoot! Don't think ab...
: No!
I beg...
Don't look! Don't look!
: Please shoot!
: Please! No!
- Don't shoot!
- Shoot!
No!
: Father!
Father! You've got to cover up!
Go, go, go, go! Go, go, go!
Go! Go!
: Push! Push!
Retreat! Retreat!
: They're retreating!
The Germans are retreating!
Damn you! Damn you!
My poor child.
Antonia, please!
It's clear. Go.
I killed my brother.
Don't worry, my son.
I killed Otto.
: It's not your fault.
Forgive me, Father.
I've killed Otto.
Father.
Feel this knife. Feel it.
I will go and kill the man
who has killed my brothers.
I will thrust this in his heart.
- Alberto.
- Leave me. Stay away from me.
Too many women have already been
left without their husbands.
Stay away from me!
- Don't do it.
- I'm just going to inspect the walls.
That's not true. I know where
you are going. I can see it in your eyes.
To whom you are going?
Don't talk to me about women losing
their husbands. My brothers are dead.
Dead!
I tried to stop you.
Why did you refuse me?
Because I was trying to protect you.
Yeah?
Is this is your way of protecting people?
Denying their feelings?
Pretending you care?
Making them suffer?
- You don't understand.
- Oh, I understand my feelings.
If you love me...
If you love me, then don't go.
Leave me.
Where did you get the dagger?
You yourself gave it to me.
Some time ago.
You're the son of the blacksmith.
How dare you?
You will die for this.
You know that.
I am not afraid.
There are hundreds of young
men out there in the city
ready to do what
I've not accomplished.
In a matter of days,
your city will cease to exist,
and many other men will be dead.
I remember you.
I've thought about you many times
since you saved my life
and became part of my destiny.
I should call the guards now.
But I won't.
I'll let you go.
Your days are numbered, old king.
Damn you.
Alberto. Alberto!
Father.
Where are your daughters?
I can't say.
Eleonora made me swear not to
tell anyone where she was going.
Especially not you, Alberto.
: The Germans are here!
The Germans are here!
Who opened the gate?
Stop!
: Out of the way!
Master Guitelmo!
Stop! Too much blood
has already been spilled!
Master Guitelmo!
I've been to your house.
Tessa wasn't there.
Oh, you watch out, Siniscalco Barozzi.
Even the blackest of dogs
gets lit by a torch.
This dog has teeth.
Take these peasants away.
Huh?
Take them away!
Hold him!
I will kill you!
I will kill you, Barozzi,
if it's the last thing I do!
Milan has fallen,
and Milan is the gateway to Sicily.
Not much time will pass
before the empire that was
of Charlemagne will be yours.
: This is what happens
to those who rebel
against their emperor.
I order Milan to be
razed to the ground.
None of its towers
will ever be standing.
I also order all the Milanese
to leave the city before sunset
in all different directions
so that no one will be
able to call themselves Milanese
and the name Milan will
be deleted from all maps.
No.
Wherever you will go,
I will be by your side.
You see? The svevo
has a dagger by his side.
An armed emperor at a crowning.
Unheard of.
Why on earth not?
A dagger and a crown, if used wisely,
can take one very far.
All the more so if the pope
who crowns Barbarossa
is the one that he himself has chosen.
: Barbarossa!
: Barbarossa!
Barbarossa! Barbarossa!
We will revive the old glory of Rome.
Rome is at your feet, my lord,
as soon will be the south of Italy,
the Norman Kingdom.
Barbarossa! Barbarossa!
- Guard! Stop!
- Yes, Your Majesty?
A man collapsed back there.
Go and see why.
It's the plague, Your Majesty.
- Oh, my God. Let's go.
- Come. Escort the queen.
- Move! Out of the way!
- Out of the way!
Let the emperor through!
Greetings.
: In the name of God, Lorenzo,
look what we have come to.
We are forced to meet in
hiding as we are outlaws,
and with our people starving
and having to bear the arrogance
of the imperial guards day after day!
Yes. And they've increased the
taxes on the harvest, again.
We must do something!
: Quiet. Quiet!
Silence.
There is no point arguing
amongst ourselves.
- What's happening?
- It's a secret meeting.
I see all the nobles from Milan.
We have been starved,
forced to leave Milan
in six different directions.
Who's there?
There's Negro and Dell'Orto.
Barbarossa has taken away
everything from us:
Our homes,
our work,
and also our pride and our dignity.
That's why we must react.
We must rebuild the city.
- Right.
- Rebuild the city?
Rebuild the city with whom, Gherardo?
All around me I see tired, resigned faces
who don't want to fight anymore.
And Barbarossa is growing
stronger every day.
Now he's the Lord of Milan.
: He's right!
He's the lord!
Barbarossa is the lord
because the people of Lombard
have accepted the role of servants.
- Get back! Get back, I said!
- Put down your swords! He's one of us.
We can defeat him...
if we stay united.
Listen.
Listen to me.
I can still see
the towers of Milan crumble...
and the looks on our people as they were
forced to abandon their homes like dogs.
Yet, I can feel the anger and the dismay
in Barbarossa's allies.
Lombards, like us,
who fought against Milan
and yet regretted its fate.
Because they finally understood
that it was our quarrels
and rivalries that allowed the emperor
to win and enslave us all.
Milan would have been destroyed
even if the other cities...
That is not true!
It is true!
Think about the strength
our swords would have united!
Think about the force
our swords can have united.
You're noble people.
Do the noble thing. Do it.
This time I'm going
to jump with you, Alberto.
Whatever you may have in mind.
Lorenzo.
This meeting is over.
Come! Let's go!
It's me.
we had another meeting at
the Pontida Monastery tonight.
We still haven't reached any
decision about what to do.
Alberto.
You live here by yourself?
- What is he doing here?
- Alberto is, uh...
where's your sister?
Where's Tessa?
- Tessa is dead.
- What?
What?
What happened?
Tessa is no longer of this world.
There's no use talking about it.
Master Guitelmo,
I need your permission to take
your daughter out of here.
She can't keep on living here alone.
- I like to be here alone.
- Permission granted.
Why did you leave me?
Because you hurt me.
I was scared and angry.
I'm sorry.
You treated me like everyone else.
Antonia! Antonia!
: Alberto's back!
Eleonora! Eleonora!
- Antonia. I'm so happy to see you.
- I can't believe it.
You've come!
Eleonora. I'm so happy to see you.
: She's living around here.
Oh, you're back. I'm so happy.
The imperials!
Get in. Take them in.
No.
You all know why we're here.
- Bastard!
- Wait.
One third of the harvest
belongs to the emperor.
Philip. In the cart.
Right away, Your Excellency.
Men, load the cart.
What's in there?
: Grab everything.
It's just a blacksmith's workshop.
A blacksmith's shop?
With a lock that big?
I wonder.
Hyah!
The imperials,
they treat us like animals,
and we let them do so for a long time.
That's over now.
We want to be free.
Free.
Do you know what I mean?
We'll look for other young men like us...
willing to die for freedom.
We'll form an army.
Help me. Hold it.
This could be our symbol:
An iron ring...
... that could bind us all together.
: It's a sign from God!
: Quickly! Quickly!
: It's a terrible
omen, Your Majesty.
The plague breaking out
on the day of coronation.
Don't be ridiculous!
The plague only broke out
because of the heat.
: Did you see?
She interrupted the meeting.
Unheard of.
Unbelievable.
Unfortunately, Your Majesty,
everyone will say
it's a sign from God.
That the coronation itself
was a sacrilege.
That God sides with Pope Alexander.
Oh, stop it now!
: Did you see?
She interrupted the chancellor.
God is with you, Frederick.
He wanted you emperor of Rome.
He wants you emperor of the world.
Continue your march south.
You can't stop now.
: It's impossible.
Your Majesty, the men
are afraid of the plague,
and we are losing control
of the population.
- We must leave this infected city.
- He's right. It's true.
We have to leave.
All right.
Tell your men we're leaving.
We're going home.
That is all for now.
Eugenie!
Prepare to depart.
That's quite a lot of rings, Alberto.
Who's supposed to wear them?
There's only a few fingers here.
Oh, you're wrong, my friend.
There are plenty of fingers
to fit these rings.
You see, I've been thinking
about this for many years now.
The imperials, they use
fear and death
as means to divide us and control us.
We're all afraid.
But if we could turn that fear around
and use it as a driving force
to unite us all...
we could become invincible.
After all, what have we got to lose?
Death?
Death?
Death to the imperials.
Yeah, death to the imperials.
We could become the Company of Death.
- Company of Death?
- Yeah.
It's a good idea.
Yeah, the Company of Death.
: Death or freedom.
Death or freedom.
Death and freedom, my friend.
Yeah.
You're gonna get yourself
into a lot of trouble one day.
Right there.
- You see?
- Ottone!
Do you remember me?
Lorenzo!
What are you doing here?
Tired of playing games?
I told you it's not possible.
I'm doing too much already.
This prison is full of dirt.
No one will notice.
Huh?
These two.
No, not these two.
They nearly killed two imperials.
Choose two others.
No, I want these two.
- Who are these?
- Who are these?
Who are you?
We're citizens tired of being wronged.
- So what?
- Break this.
Now break that.
The humiliation that Milan
has suffered over these years
has now become intolerable.
Brescia will be by your side to help you
against the emperor
and also to build Milan again.
Yes! Yes!
We, the people of Mantua,
are not just going to stand by and watch.
But you all know what
the emperor's answer will be.
He's right.
People will live in terror
of retaliation.
And what are Lodi or Pavia going to do?
I'll tell you what we're going to do.
We're going to stick together, united,
under a Lombard league.
This time we're not going to wait
for Barbarossa's punishment.
An army becomes invincible
with a strong heart,
especially with a wounded heart.
Go to your cities.
Ask the young if they're still willing
to live this way.
You know what they'll tell you.
Do you know?
- Better dead than slaves!
- Better dead than slaves!
- Better dead than slaves!
- Better dead than slaves!
- Better dead than slaves!
- Company of Death, Milano.
- Death Bergamo!
- Death Brescia!
Death Mantua!
The land Barbarossa
treads on is our land.
It belongs to us Lombards
ever since we have a memory.
We, soldiers of the Company of Death,
swear to take back this land of ours,
to fight the emperor and never
to turn our backs on the enemy.
To unite all cities in a league and
to defend the most precious of all good:
Freedom.
Freedom.
Freedom!
: Freedom!
Freedom!
Freedom!
Freedom!
Freedom!
It's you. Come.
Oh, my God, Eleonora.
I'm so happy.
I'm so happy to see you.
I can't believe it.
Come on, sit down.
So tell me, what forced you to come
all the way up here?
Alberto and many of the young men
from Milan have abandoned their homes
and now they're hiding in the woods.
And others will join them soon.
They have given themselves a name.
The Company of Death.
The Company of Death?
The name makes me think
of the evil of damnation.
What company are you speaking of?
Hundreds. Hundreds of young men, Tessa.
They want to give Milan back its freedom.
Oh, soon you will be able
to come back home, my sister.
Do you really think
I can come back to Milan?
I truly believe that.
They're willing to do anything.
Anything. Even to die.
Are you afraid for Alberto?
Are you still in love with him?
Yes.
And he is with me.
He asked me to marry him.
But I saw...
Don't give in to your visions, Eleonora.
Listen to your heart.
You must listen to your heart.
Go to him and tell him
you will accept his proposal.
At least one of us can be happy.
Eleonora!
- Now!
- Grab him!
- Get him!
- Stop him!
Stop him!
Get back! It's a woman!
Watch out! She's armed!
what are you doing here? Hey.
Give me the knife.
Give me the knife!
They're friends
in the Company of Death.
You see. It's getting bigger.
What are you doing here on horseback?
I was on my way home.
Home? Milan is 18 miles that way.
- So what? Leave me alone!
- Leave us.
Listen to me.
In some time now, we're gonna have
to meet Barbarossa in battle.
Some of us will die.
Marry me.
Now.
Stop trying to run away.
Why don't you understand?
The world we grew up in
doesn't exist anymore.
Everything has changed.
Everything.
: I love you.
Open up!
Open the door.
We've come for the emperor's share.
This is an enclosed cloister.
You have no right to enter.
Open the door, Mother.
My right comes directly
from the emperor Frederick.
I repeat. You can't enter.
Open the door.
What's the matter?
What did I do?
What's the matter?
Hey.
Hey.
Come on, move!
- What do you think?
- Come on. We'll have some fun here.
Search everywhere.
- Oh, God.
- What's wrong, sister?
Everywhere!
They all look alike, don't they?
But under those clothes,
there may be some beautiful women.
Mother Superior?
Where are you?
Mother Superior!
I'm here.
Tell them to take off their veils.
I beg you, in the name of the Lord,
what you ask is a sacrilege.
If you don't do it, I will.
Kill me if you want,
but don't ask me to do that.
As you wish.
What about this one? Huh?
Hmm. The quality seems
quite low to start off with.
Um, this one!
Ah.
Indeed, this one is not bad.
If she had long hair,
she would be pretty.
What about this one?
Look at him.
No. No.
And, uh...
This one.
: Wow. Yeah.
She's really beautiful, sir.
Really beautiful.
Tessa?
Tessa?
Is it you?
I have prayed for this moment.
Tell me what you want me to do.
Tell me. Anything.
No!
No!
Stop her! Stop her!
Stop her!
- How dare you!
- Stop her!
- No!
- Come back!
Come back!
Stop her!
Wait! Wait! Wait!
- Please!
- Stop! Don't do it.
Please, don't do it.
Tessa.
No. No, no, no, no.
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
Don't, Tessa.
I beg of you, please.
No. No. Don't.
I beg of you.
I love you.
I love you with all my heart.
I love you more than
I've loved anything in my life.
Stay with me.
I'll change.
I'll do anything you say.
I beg of you. No.
Just don't leave me.
Just... No!
Please.
Please.
Just give me your hand.
Just give me your...
- No!
- No!
Tessa!
I loved her.
I loved her.
I loved her.
I loved her.
I loved her.
I loved...
: She cut his throat!
Arrest her!
- No! Leave her alone!
- She's a witch!
You're going to pay for this, witch!
- Alberto!
- What's going on, Nicola?
Eleonora almost killed Barozzi
with a dagger to the throat.
- Where is she?
- Barozzi is taking her to Alessandria,
to Barbarossa's camp.
He wants to burn her at the stake.
: Alberto, don't go!
Don't go!
: Come on! Don't go!
- Alberto, don't go!
- Let go!
Get him down from that horse!
Get off me! Let go of me!
- Alberto!
- Let go of me!
- Calm down!
- Let go of me!
Let go of me!
- That's just what Barozzi wants.
- Damn it!
Let go of me!
They'll kill you.
Hold him! Hold him!
Let go! Leave me alone!
Leave me alone! Leave me alone!
Damn you! Let go of me!
Let go of me! Let go of me! Aah!
Get out of here! Out of here!
Get away from me! Get away!
Hurry up with that. Hurry up.
Bring more now.
That cart is almost full.
Send another.
Get in there, witch!
I survived.
I don't think you'll be so lucky.
I'm going to watch you burn.
: Bad news, bad news.
we've been trying to conquer
this city for weeks.
How is the tunnel proceeding?
Your Majesty, as you know,
we can only dig during our attacks
in order to cover the noise,
and this rain is certainly
not helping either.
Double the digging.
The rivers around the city are
full with water, Your Majesty.
If they overflow their banks,
the whole camp will be submerged.
The men are tired. The rain,
the mud are destroying our troops.
Shut up!
We will get into the city before dawn.
Make sure the tunnel is ready.
: Have no fear.
The door will stay...
I have no fear at all!
Yes. She's here.
She's here.
- Open the door.
- But, Your Highness, uh...
Open the door! It's an order!
- Do it!
- Yes, ma'am.
: Close the door.
You know who I am?
You must be a very important person
if you give the orders to the guard.
I was curious to see the woman
who had the courage to slit the throat
of an imperial envoy.
Next time, my hand will be firmer.
There won't be a next time,
and you know it.
Tell me.
Why did you do it?
He killed my sister.
And because of him,
my husband risks his life.
What do you mean?
Why is he in danger?
What happened to your arm?
It's the mark of a lightning strike.
Lightning struck you
and you didn't die?
What are you?
A witch?
Oh, a witch?
Oh, get me out of here!
Get me out of here! Get me...
Open the door!
Get me out of here!
She's a witch!
I don't want to stay with a witch!
Get me out! Get me out!
Shut up, wench!
Get back in there!
Oh, God.
They will have no chance.
The scythes are exactly at
the height of the horsemen.
Very good, boys.
Move quietly. Quiet. Shh.
Quiet.
Move. Quickly.
Quiet. Quiet. Silence. Shh. Quiet.
Wait, wait. Get ready.
Get ready.
It seems peaceful...
: Get out! Get out!
Everybody out!
- Sound the alarm!
- Call the guards!
The Germans are attacking!
They've built a tunnel!
Come on! Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!
Your Highness, we've been discovered.
The tunnel has been closed.
Set all the war machines
on fire. We retreat.
Damn Alexander and his... city.
We're retreating to Pavia.
They're loyal to us.
We'll be there for a while.
There's only one thing you should do.
Send messengers to
your cousin Henry the Lion.
You need fresh troops.
He can't refuse to help you.
Henry is greedy for land.
We've been away from Germany too long.
That's a good idea.
Let's do that.
I'll get ready to pack.
One more thing
before leaving camp, my lord.
Pardon that prisoner
from Milan, please.
Why are you so worried
about some peasant woman?
That woman has extraordinary
powers, Frederick.
They say she's a witch.
On her arm, she bears the mark
when she was struck by lightning.
What is it that troubles you?
Lightning spared her.
Don't defy heaven. Pardon her, please.
If you burn her,
she will bring you bad luck.
Beatrice, this woman
has to be punished.
If we burn her, she'll be happy to go.
Be ready.
How are things, cousin?
And where's the army you promised me?
Look at me, Your Majesty.
I'm 46 and full of aches and pains.
War is a luxury
I can no longer afford.
I'm much older than you are,
and I'm still willing
to fight for the empire.
Your Majesty, I'm ready too.
In there is enough money
to pay many men.
It is yours, Your Highness.
It is my contribution to your cause.
Stop it!
You know all too well that
the emperor doesn't need money.
He needs soldiers, an army.
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
Your emperor allowed you
to have Saxony and Bavaria.
He defended you from all the German princes
who schemed against you.
And now... now that the emperor
asks for your help,
all you are able to give
is some miserable money?
Why, what confidence.
My cousin Frederick should worry about
having a wife that speaks like a man.
Yah!
They call you Henry the Lion,
but you're worthless.
Let's go.
Ah, give over.
Stop your whinging, witch!
- I told you to wait for me!
- Sorry, Your Excellency.
I got a direct order from the empress.
It doesn't matter.
As long as she burns.
Burn. Burn!
- No! No!
- Burn.
No!
Men of the Company of Death,
we gather here today in a common dream:
The dream of freedom.
Freedom that is our birthright.
Freedom that was taken away from us.
It was taken away from us
by manipulating us,
separating us, dividing us,
by fear.
But this common dream can unite us.
We can mend our fields, walk our lands
and raise our families in peace.
Let us not fear tomorrow,
for to live one day in total freedom
means more than a
hundred days of slavery!
Together we'll go. Freedom!
: Freedom!
Freedom!
Freedom! Freedom!
Halt.
Charge!
Look. Men of the league.
Oh, my God!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Hold.
What the hell?
Hold the line, boys.
Hold the line.
Ah. They've seen the whole army.
They're afraid to attack.
I don't like it.
I don't like this maneuver.
Your Highness,
the Milanese army has taken position
roughly two miles from here,
on the plain over there.
Can you see them?
Milanese are stupid. We can handle them.
Your Majesty, we were attacked
only by their cavalry.
We didn't see their infantry.
First, we cripple their cavalry.
Then their infantry will fall apart.
Beatrice, I thank God every night
he gave me a woman
like you to come home to.
My place is where my lord is.
Your place today is with the children.
Take the empress to Pavia.
This is war, my love.
Charge!
Hold the line, boys.
Hold the formation.
Not yet. Hold.
Hold!
Not yet.
Now!
Now!
Go! Go!
Attack! Attack!
Charge forward! Forward!
What now?
Scythes up!
Keep going forward!
Forward! Forward!
Keep going forward!
Attack! Attack!
Charge!
Attack!
Forward, men! Forward!
Forward!
You!
Ha!
No!
Lorenzo!
Prepare to join your bitch whore
sweetheart in hell!
No!
Look at me! Look at me!
No. No.
- I want you to see me when you die.
- No.
Don't kill me, please.
Please don't kill me.
I want you to hurt.
This is going to hurt
for all the pain you've given me.
For all the pain
you've given my family!
I have money.
You go with my people.
Don't kill me.
Don't, don't, don't.
I beg you.
This is for Tessa.
Do you feel that?
This is for my brothers!
This one... This one...
Look at me. This is for my wife.
For my wife.
Look at me! Look at me!
Damn you!
Alberto!
Alberto.
The emperor's horse.
I can see it's his horse.
Where is he?
I don't know.
He must be here, somewhere around.
Rest assured.
I want to see his body.
Barbarossa's dead.
Give me that dagger.
I miss her.
Nothing.
Nothing will give you Eleonora back.
But if she were here,
she'd like to see you happy.
You gave what you wanted.
You gave the freedom
back to your people.
: Alberto! Alberto!
Come quickly!
Look.
You're alive.
You're alive.
Alberto.
What are you doing here?
- The empress, she... she saved my life.
- What?
They burned another woman in my place.
And you're alive. You're alive.
I love you.
: Freedom. Freedom.
- Freedom.
- Freedom.
: Freedom. Freedom.
Freedom.
Freedom!
: Freedom!
Freedom!
: Freedom!
- Freedom!
: - Freedom!
- Freedom!
: - Freedom!
- Freedom!
: - Freedom!
Freedom!
