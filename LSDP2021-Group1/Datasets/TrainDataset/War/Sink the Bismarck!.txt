This is London. Ed Murrow reporting.
To an American reporter...
there is something very special
about the people of this city...
this island, this nation.
Never in the long and stormy
history of Great Britain...
have her fortunes been
as low as they are...
in this spring of 1941.
Britain is fighting alone
for her very existence...
fighting desperately.
Yet her people remain
steadfast and unflinching.
Britain's allies have been
defeated one by one...
as the dark stain of Nazi conquest...
spreads across the map of Europe.
In Africa, Rommel is giving
the Eighth Army a very bad time.
Greece has fallen.
And the  continues
to smash English cities.
The worst news of all
comes from the North Atlantic...
where last month, German U-boats
and surface raiders...
sank 600,000 tons of shipping.
In this battle,
Britain's lifeblood is at stake.
This is the battle on which depends...
the future course of the war...
the future course of British history.
The battle of the North Atlantic
is fought at sea...
but it is directed from
the admiralty, here in London.
Very deep in the ancient
Admiralty Building...
Here is the guiding brain
and central nervous system...
of the British navy...
The Operations Division.
Robert.
Sir?
Take Captain Shepard's things...
and put them in the office.
Aye, sir.
Thank you.
This, of course, is the message center...
for incoming and outgoing signals.
These tubes lead to
the wireless room down the hall.
Oh, Shepard...
Anything wrong?
That man's uniform.
Oh. We're quite informal here
about some things.
You'll find it's much different...
from the bridge of a ship at sea.
It has to be that way.
Shepard, this is Commander Richards...
the duty plot officer.
Captain Shepard is
the new director of operations.
How do you do?
Don't let me interrupt your meal.
Captain Shepard,
Second Officer Anne Davis.
Captain Shepard's taking over for me.
How do you do, sir?
How do you do?
Be nice to her, Shepard.
If she got angry and walked out,
we'd lose the war.
Really?
Seriously, you can depend on
this young lady.
I've done it many times.
Anne, be a darling, will you...
and get your plot report in
as soon as possible.
We mustn't be late...
forJimmy's party tonight.
Right-oh.
I suppose I should shed a few tears...
at leaving this place...
but quite honestly, I've hated the job.
Too much responsibility,
strain.
I'm getting a command at sea.
That's what I've always wanted.
Congratulations.
I hope you find one...
that doesn't involve too much strain.
It's a different kind of strain.
If a man's going to serve in the navy...
he ought to serve at sea...
unless, of course,
it's a man like yourself...
who's already seen action.
He should still serve at sea.
Yes. Well, I better get along.
I'll say good-bye now...
unless you have any questions.
I don't think so. Good luck.
Thank you.
We thought we might be of some
assistance, sir...
not knowing your way around yet.
Is there anything I can do for you?
Yes, there is something.
I saw a rating enter the war room...
without his jumper.
From now on, everyone
will be properly dressed at all times.
I cannot have officers
eating sandwiches on duty...
Commander, under any circumstances.
I'm sorry, sir. Won't happen again.
Excuse me, sir.
I think you should know
that Commander Richards...
stood two watches without relief...
I'm sure Commander Richards...
doesn't need an interpreter,
Miss Davis.
I was also surprised
to hear a Wren officer...
addressed by her Christian name.
To me, this kind of informality...
is both irregular and inexcusable.
Come in!
Sorry to interrupt, sir.
Priority signal.
Thank you.
Huh. Excuse me.
Come in.
Oh, Shepard.
You know the assistant chief
of naval staff.
Yes, indeed, sir. Very well.
How are you,Jonathan?
I'm glad to see you again.
I have a signal here...
from our naval attache in Stockholm.
He reports two large German warships...
steaming through the Kattegat.
What ships are they?
He doesn't say.
Think it might be the
It's possible, sir.
She's just completed
three months' training...
in the Baltic.
Couldn't pick a better time
to break out...
with this Crete business
going on...
and our convoys scattered.
I have a nasty hunch
that's the idea, sir.
I hope you're wrong.
Can't afford to have that monster loose.
Look what
and  did to us.
All in two months.
They don't have anything like
fire power.
She could stand off and sink
every ship in a convoy...
without ever coming under fire.
Shepard, get on to
the Commander-in-Chief,
Home Fleet.
Tell him we're not sure...
but we're very much concerned.
We'll let him have...
every scrap of information.
Aye aye, sir.
Oh, and, Shepard.
I wish you'd prepare
your recommendations...
in case it is the
Very good, sir.
Pretty rough assignment...
for a new man on the job.
I'm not worried about Shepard.
He's one of the ablest men
in the service.
I'm told he's as cold
as a witch's heart.
That's a slight exaggeration, sir.
I want a man who's cold.
I'd like a man with no heart at all...
no soul...
just an enormous brain.
The battle of the North Atlantic...
is a grim business.
It won't be won
by charm and personality.
We've had too much of that.
I've known Shepard for years.
We've served together before.
He was different then.
Any particular reason for the change?
I suspect there are many reasons, sir...
reasons of a personal nature.
Oh. I see.
Well, how are we going to
get the information...
on those two ships?
We have an agent in southern Norway...
Get in touch with him.
It's too dangerous to get in touch
with him directly.
There isn't time to go
through Zurich or Stockholm.
In this case,
you'll have to make direct contact.
Sir, this man is
in Nazi-occupied territory.
I realize that.
All the same, we must get
in touch with him immediately.
Aye aye, sir.
The enemy ships
were sighted coming out of the Baltic...
obviously heading out to sea...
obviously not in the service
of the king.
Now, what have we got over here
at Scapa Flow?
Battleships King George V,
Prince of Wales...
battle cruiser
a few cruisers and destroyers.
The rest of the fleet's
out on convoy escort.
It's from Admiral Cunningham, sir.
"Situation in Crete is deteriorating.
German airborne troops
have captured Maleme Airfield."
Why is it we never get
our bad medicine in small doses?
Perfect timing for an enemy breakout...
in the North Atlantic.
Cunningham and his fleet
busy down here in Crete.
Sommerville's got his hands full...
trying to reinforce Malta
with Force H.
are up here at Brest.
We must keep them covered.
And 16 convoys to guard...
scattered all over the Atlantic.
If we had a hundred more ships...
we still wouldn't have enough.
Sir, we've just had a signal...
from our agent in Norway.
The message is incomplete.
"Sighted two enemy ships
of Kristiansand at 033 5
sailing due west...
Cruiser  and..."
The transmission stopped
abruptly at that point, sir.
Did you try to get him back?
Yes, sir. No further contact.
Where is Kristiansand?
Off here, sir.
Southern tip of Norway.
What do you think, A.C.N.S.?
I don't think this man...
would have transmitted
in the circumstances...
if it hadn't been something
really important.
Then we'll proceed on the assumption...
that it's
May I suggest we put
Coastal Command to work...
on air reconnaissance?
Yes. Everything from Bergen southwards.
Tell them to photograph
everything that looks suspicious.
I'll talk to Commander-in-Chief
at Scapa Flow.
Aye aye, sir.
Excuse me, sir.
First sea lord on the line, sir.
Commander-in-Chief, sir.
Hello,Jack. How are you?
I'm fine.
Those two German ships...
were sighted off southern Norway
at 033 5.
One is the
and we're not sure about the other.
Do you think it's...
I suggest you proceed
on the worst possible assumption...
that it's
and she's breaking out.
I can't think of anything worse.
We can't let that ship
get loose in the Atlantic.
I'll come to immediate notice
for steam, sir.
All right. Good-bye.
We're directed to assume
that it's
accompanied by
and that they're attempting to...
break out into the convoy lanes.
Now, gentlemen, they'd have
four available passages...
wouldn't they?
Here's the Denmark Strait...
the passage south of Iceland...
the Faeroes-Shetland Passage...
and the Fair Island Channel...
between the Orkneys and the Shetlands.
Anyone care to place a bet?
What about the Iceland-Faeroes
Channel?
Not too near our bases,
room to maneuver.
Why wouldn't he take the nearest exit?
Fair Island Channel's
only a few hundred miles.
Too close to our air patrol.
All you're saying is
it could be any one of the four.
Actually, of course,
you're perfectly right.
I'm afraid somehow or other...
we've got to guard them all.
Have we any idea
where they are now, sir?
Nothing definite.
Jenkins, check with Coastal Command...
that they're carrying out a search.
Aye aye, sir.
Looks like two cruisers.
That's what the pilot said.
One's a cruiser, all right.
The other one's...
been located in Norway.
Definitely identified.
in Grimstad Fjord.
They want us to send
everything we've got...
Bombers, torpedo planes, everything.
No luck. Nothing.
Visibility down to nil.
Cloud down to 200 feet, sir.
Can't get a bombing run
in weather like that.
What convoy's that, Miss Jackson?
What convoy's that, Miss Jackson?
O.G.62, sir.
Right.
Now, Miss Davis, take the
from O.G.62.
Put her with the Home Fleet.
Good.
Now take the
from that convoy forming
up in the Clyde...W.S.8.B....
And put her with the Home Fleet.
Sir, Operations Home Fleet calling.
Director of operations.
No, I'm sorry.
We still have no information.
Well, the weather's closed in
over there.
The aircraft can't see a thing.
Yes, as soon... as soon as I hear, right.
Right. I will.
Now...
take the  from W.S.8.B.
and put her with the Home Fleet.
Right.
Home Fleet looks better now, doesn't it?
Yes, sir, but I wouldn't give much
for the convoy.
You do recall that's a troop convoy...
don't you, sir?
Yes, I do.
They've got a long way to go...
round the cape to the Middle East.
This leaves them unprotected.
I'm quite aware of the circumstances,
Miss Davis.
This is a risk we have to take.
have to take, sir?
Well, Shepard...
what do you have in mind?
I think we must reinforce
the Home Fleet, sir.
They can't patrol everything
from here to Greenland...
with what they've got now.
Well, where do we get the ships?
We'd have to take ships from other duty.
It would involve some risk.
We could take
and  off escort duty.
That would give the Commander-in-Chief
an aircraft carrier...
and another battle cruiser.
What convoy were they covering?
The W.8.S.B., sailing
from the Clyde tomorrow.
It's a large troop convoy, sir...
We'd be exposing them to
a long and dangerous voyage...
without proper escort.
Is that what you're recommending?
Yes, sir.
You're willing to gamble
the lives of 20,000 men?
I think there's a difference...
between a gamble and a calculated risk.
Good for you, Shepard.
Of course, I realize it's...
It's not an easy decision to make.
The important ones never are.
All right, go ahead...
and detach those two ships
from the convoy.
Inform Commander-in-Chief,
Home Fleet.
Aye aye, sir.
They're giving us

Now we can send
and  out...
to support the patrols
in the Greenland area.
I want them ready to sail
within an hour.
has civilian workers aboard.
They're making adjustments
to the gun turrets.
If they don't finish their work,
they'll sail with the ship.
Aye aye, sir.
As far as the rest of the fleet...
we'll wait for definite information.
I suppose my nerves
can stand it if yours can.
I've just talked to Captain Shepard.
The visibility over the coast of Norway...
is absolutely nil.
She may be there. She may not.
What's the latest forecast?
Pretty bad, I'm afraid, sir.
Looks like two days
of very thick weather.
The weather report is
very good, Admiral...
Two days of heavy overcast.
Good news, is it not so, Captain?
It is, sir.
Thank you, Bernhardt.
We have a most interesting
chess game here, Lindemann.
The important moves
this time are at the opening.
To break out into the Atlantic
will not be easy, sir.
Yes, but we have the advantage...
because they do not know
what we are going to do.
We can move out immediately...
or we can hide for a while...
under this beautiful overcast.
Also, we have a choice
of four different exits.
Group North has suggested
the Iceland-Faeroes Passage.
You're not forgetting that, sir?
We have to take orders from Group North.
We do not have to take suggestions.
Yes, sir.
Lindemann, we have
a great opportunity here.
I do not intend to let Group North...
or anyone else lose it for me.
There can be great glory in this voyage...
glory for the Third Reich...
glory for us!
For you, sir.
You are the fleet commander.
I will see that you are not forgotten.
I was forgotten after the last war.
Until the fuehrer came to power...
I got no recognition, no promotion.
I was ignored...
just as Germany was ignored.
The world only remembers the winners,
Lindemann.
We must make sure this time...
that it will remember us.
I am sure it will.
How soon can you get under way?
I can have steam in half an hour, sir.
I want to be out of here
in 15 minutes.
Signal
Very well, sir.
Sir, it's a signal from
the Commander-in-Chief,
Home Fleet.
An aircraft from Hatston's
got through to Grimstad.
There's nothing there now, sir.
Well, they've sailed.
At least we know that much.
Now we can get moving.
Position of all convoys, sir.
Thank you.
All we can do now is wait
and see what happens.
That's the worst part
of our job...the waiting.
You have a son
in the service, haven't you?
Yes, sir. He's at Gibraltar.
He's an air gunner in the
I bet you're glad...
he won't be mixed up
in this  show.
Why should I be glad?
If you were, you wouldn't admit it,
would you?
He must take his chance
like everybody else.
I see.
There's an air vice marshal
coming in later...
to help out on reconnaissance.
Give him a briefing, will you?
You wanted to speak to the crew,
Captain?
They've been alerted.
Captain Lindemann...
with your permission...
I would like to address
the ship's company.
As you wish, sir.
Thank you.
Officers and men of the
this is the fleet commander.
We are going out into the North Atlantic...
to attack the British convoy system.
We are going to sink their ships...
until they no longer dare
to let them sail.
It's true we are only two ships...
but the world has never seen such ships.
We are sailing in the largest...
the most powerful battleship afloat...
superior to anything
in the British navy.
We are faster...
we are unsinkable, and we are German!
You cadet officers...
you were selected by
the highest authority...
to make this voyage.
When you return to the fleet...
you will have many
inspiring stories to tell...
stories of German sea power...
stories of Nazi victory!
To all of you, I say this...
Never forget that you are Germans...
never forget that you are Nazis!
Heil Hitler!
In the center, the main plot.

Fine. Carry on.

for any two ships.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
The first sea lord can see you now.
Thank you very much, Shepard.
Yes, sir.
Right, sir.
Yes, I will.
Commander Richards, who's your relief?
Dexter, sir.
He's late, isn't he?
A little. I don't mind, sir.
I do. Tell him I'll require him for duty
the next three nights.
Come in.
Thought you might like some tea, sir...
since you won't take any rest.
What are you doing here?
You're off duty.
Third Officer Simpson's down with flu.
I'm just filling in.
Oh, thank you. Would you file that
for me, please?
There's an air raid going on up top.
Bad one?
No, not very.
Won't your family be worried about you?
I have no family here.
My father lives in Canada now.
I thought that surely you must
be married or something.
No, sir. Nothing at all.
Doesn't that seem odd...
if you don't mind my saying so?
I was going to be married last year...
but...it didn't work out.
His fault or yours?
He was at Dunkirk...
and he was listed as missing in action.
It was just a year ago...
a year ago next week.
He was a rather wonderful man...
not brilliant or dashing
or anything like that...
but just rather wonderful.
I'm sorry.
I think it helps to
talk about these things...
don't you, sir?
No, I don't.
I don't think it helps at all.
Getting emotional about things...
is a peacetime luxury.
In wartime, it's much too painful.
You can't turn off your emotions...
just because there's a war on.
You can't do anything
about your feelings.
Yes, you can.
Director of operations.
Tell you why I called,Jonathan.
Dexter's here in my office...
and he has rather a special problem.
I understand you've given him
extra duty.
Correct. I'll require him for duty
the next three nights.
It seems that his girl is an army nurse.
She's got orders to sail tomorrow night.
I'm very sorry that Dexter's young lady
is going overseas...
but that's beside the point.
Couldn't you make an exception?
I won't make an exception
for this officer...
or any other...
certainly not for reasons
of personal convenience.
Well, it's very simple, sir...
either you have discipline
or you haven't.
Well, I'm sorry, Dexter.
Thank you, sir.
By the way, Jonathan...
there's a fleet commander
aboard the
Yes. Admiral Gunther Lutjens.
Lutjens.
You know this man?
Yes, sir, I do.
One of his cruisers sank my ship.
Oh. Then you'll have a special interest
in him.

Yes, sir.

Any air reconnaissance over this area?

You would be quite wrong
if you judged him too harshly.

Very good, sir.
Captain, congratulations.
It's a great moment for the German navy.
Yes, Lindemann...
and for the two of us.
This morning, HMS
largest British warship,
was sunk by the...
This is London. Ed Murrow reporting.
This island, which is
no stranger to bad tidings...
received news today that HMS
largest warship in the British fleet...
and pride of the British navy...
has been sunk by the German
battleship
From the
complement of 1,500 men...
there were three survivors.
In the same engagement...
the battleship
was badly damaged.
Two British capital ships
have been put out of commission...
and the most powerful
battleship in the world...
is now loose on the high seas.
It remains to be seen
whether the British navy...
has the capability
at this crucial moment...
of concentrating enough sea power...
to deal with the situation.
There is undoubtedly great
rejoicing in Berlin tonight...
and also on the
Here's to the ship, Lindemann...
and here's to us.
We have beaten the best they have.
Do you realize that?
Yes, sir.
They will never stop us, not now.
You wanted the damage control report.
What is it?
We received one hit
forward on the port side...
over number two fuel tank.
We're losing a little oil.
Anything serious?
No, sir. I would say
the damage is very slight.
However, I recommend we put about
and have it repaired.
Put about? You mean go home?
Yes, sir. We could refuel
at the same time.
Are you mad?
We have fought our way out
into the Atlantic.
This is no time to turn
and run for home.
We wouldn't be running.
We've won a tremendous victory.
It's not the victory that was ordered.
You haven't been close
to the high command, Lindemann.
Do you know what will happen...
when Admiral Raeder
reports the sinking of the
The fuehrer will smile...
and everyone else will smile...
and then, a few moments later...
he'll turn to Raeder with a scowl.
"What about the convoys, Raeder?
Have they sunk any convoys?"
There will still be
plenty of convoys, sir...
after we make repairs.
Is your ship unmaneuverable, Captain?
Are the guns damaged?
Anything out of action?
No, sir.
Then we will push forward...
as instructed by the high command.
But surely the fuehrer must realize...
Are you going to tell the fuehrer
what he must realize?
No, sir.
Then do not tell me.
For the time being...
we will hold our present

It's taking a serious risk.
I know Shepard has weighed
that very carefully.
In view of what the prime minister said...

We'll get you along to the sick bay.
If anything happens, I'll let you know.
Thank you, sir.
What time is it, Miss Davis?
About 6:30, sir.

No, sir.
It's based on my summing up...
of the general situation.
It was a decision that had to be made.
I hope you're right, Shepard.
I hope to God you're right.
A report from  sir.
They haven't found anything.
All right.
Are you off now, Miss Davis?
Yes, sir. My watch ends at 7:00.
I seem to have a lot of work

Could you stay and help me out?
Of course. I have a dinner date...
