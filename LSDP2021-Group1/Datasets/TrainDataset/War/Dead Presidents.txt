A pack of cigarettes?
A pack of cigarettes?
I thought maybe you should be worried
about your leg or somethin'.
- Well, that's just funny to you, huh?
- No, no, it's not funny.
I tell you what. The next time a
motherfucker grabs me by the wrong leg,
I'm gonna use it to kick his ass
between his shoulder blades.

- Hey, man, you really did that sucker.
Yeah, everybody in town

motherfucker grab the wrong one.
Me and Kirby, baby.
Yeah.
This is wonderful news,
Edward.
- Thank you.
-  All right, all right.
You see, Anthony?
You be thankful you can go to City
College on the financial aid programme.
Yeah, in four years,
you can be just like me.
Just like you.
You can graduate and maybe even
go to graduate school too.
Well, I'll tell y'all one thing.
My mama sure would've been proud.
Never would've believed
I got two college graduates.
You think about what
you're gonna major in, baby?
Uh, the Marine Corps.
Dad, could you pass the salt?
What'd you say?
Ahem. Thanks.
I said the, uh, Marine Corps.
I'm... I'm joinin'.
- Marine Corps?
- Yeah.
Now that's original.
What you talkin' about,
Anthony?
I'm talkin' about
I wanna do somethin' else.
I don't wanna go
to college.
I'm sick of school.
I mean... I don't know why everybody
got this strange look on their face.
It's my life.
Yeah.
It's your life.
Looks like to me you're tryin'
to ruin it, baby.
You're an idiot.
You know that?
Man, I don't wanna go to college.
I'm just not ready for no college.
You always said the marines and fightin'
over in Korea made a man out of you.
I figure I be, you know,
livin' my own life.
I'll talk to your mama.
? When your baby and you
are tight?
? And everything is right
and you is mellow?
Here you go.
Drink some wine.
? You keep everything
all right?
? And you know that
you're the only fellow?
? Ain't that a groove?
? Ain't that a groove
Ah?
- ? Ain't that a groove?
-
- Told your little ass
you couldn't drink with me.
- ? Ain't that a groove?
- ? Now lookee here, fella?
- Yeah. Whoa!
? Girls like to be
in the mood?
- ? Whenever they think
their man is yellow?
- Whoo!
- ? Hit me, baby?
- Yeah!
- ? You'll fight real hard...??
- Say, Skeeter, I still can't
believe you graduated, man.
-
- Man, shut up.
Glad we out of school, man.
I'm sick of these stupid-ass brothers.
I'm 'bout to get
my pimp thing on started.
You know I got so many ho's now, man,
I gotta get an assistant pimp...
just to keepin' track of 'em,
you know, make sure they
on the right streets and shit.
Say, Skippy, why... why you
always talkin' 'bout this pimp
stuff, man? What's happenin'?
'Cause it's real, man. I'm a pimp.
Pimpin' run in my family.
My great-great-granddaddy
was a slave, and he was a pimp.
He used to have ho's pick his cotton
in the field. He didn't have to do shit.
- Ha!
- You better be careful, man.
- You're gonna catch
something, Skip. Watch.
- That's all right, motherfucker.
I was born by the pussy;
I'll die by the pussy.
Don't worry about what the fuck I do.
Hey, Skip, you believe
in superstition?
Hell, no.
Well, you should, man.
Your stupid-ass jinxed me.
- What the fuck you talkin' 'bout?
- Uncle Sam, man.
- Dropped a motherfuckin' 1-A on me.
-
- I told you, didn't I?
Didn't I tell you?
- Hey, when did that happen?
- Last week, Anthony, man.
- Yeah, right, mother. Pass the joint.
- Anthony, man.
- What?
You know that, uh,
that me and Marisol, we tight, man.
Yeah, man, y'all are...
Y'all pretty down.
You would say I love her?
I could say
that you love her, man.
- I'm thinkin' about marrying her, man.
- Oh, wait a minute.
- Hey, don't do that shit.
- Hey, man, now you might be
goin' a little too fast now.
Hey, I love her, man, and did you see
how she looks today at that party, man?
-
Aw, she looks good enough to marry.
- I'm glad to hear you want me.
- What you over here
talkin' about, Anthony?
- Why you standin' over here?
- Shut up, Skippy.
- Shut up.
Anthony, I know you ain't gonna
stay over here talkin' to Skip
while my song's playin'.
Mmm. Not if they expect
to be with us tonight.
- Look, we're gonna
have to cut on out, bro.
- Uh, yeah.
- Man, where y'all goin'?
- Uh, we gonna go hang on out.
- Look it. Have some chicken.
- I thought we was hangin', man.
- Have some chicken, man.
- I told you 'bout them
broads, old punk-ass.
And anyway, Skip,
Brenda lookin' for you.
I don't give a fuck. You tell her I'm
at where I at and I'll be where I be.
Motherfuckin' pimp. I gotta go every ho

I love you.
I love you, too, mama.
If you give my pussy away
to somebody else when I'm gone,
I'm gonna come back
and blow that motherfucker up.
I got this itch
I need to be scratched.
S-S-S-S-So you're sayin'
that y-your, your mama...

the night shift tonight?
Mm-hmm. And you know
what else?
You can scratch it
all night long if you want to.
- You know I'm the nigger.
I'm the nigger. You know I'm the nigger.
- Mm-hmm.
You swear Big Bertha
won't get off work early?
She's not gonna
get off from work early.
- You scared?
- No, I ain't scared. I just don't want...
You act like you're scared.
Come on. Shut up.
- Wh-Where Delilah at?
- She in her room. Come on!
- ? Say it loud?
-
? I'm black and I'm proud?
- Get out.
- ? Say it loud?
- Go to your own room.

Oh, yeah?

To get married.
- Is that right?
- What you think about that?
Nothin', I guess.
So I guess you don't want me to
wait for you either.
Look, Juanita,
I didn't say that.
So you gonna marry me
when you get back?
I mean, if you ain't
got somebody else.
I don't want nobody else.
Juanita, have you
ever thought maybe...
maybe I might get hurt out there
and never come back?
You know, I don't want you
waitin' for nothin'.
You not scared
of losing me?
I didn't say that either.
I'm scared
of losin' you.
So do you think we could probably
do it one more time before I go?
Uh-huh.
Oh, no.
- It's Ma!
- Shh! But it's just 6:30!

Oh, shoot!

- Wait a minute!
Come on.
Let me help you with them packages.

Since I work, the least you girls

You know I'm gonna

Kiss my ass, nigger. You the reason why

Shit, that's all right, though.
He got out of this shit.
I rather be home with a fucked-up hand
up in some pussy than to be out here...
healthier than
a motherfucker without it.
- Shit.
- Same old Skip. Boy, you ain't changed.
That's right.
You heard from Juanita?
She used to write me a lot
during my first tour.
We got a package for ya!
Turns out, man, before I left,
fucked around and got her pregnant.
- Man, you bullshittin'.
- No, I ain't.
- No shit?
- Dead serious, man.
Got a little girl back at home.
Oh, man, that's groovy, man. That's
groovy. I can dig it. That's cool.
Hey, dig, man, I know
you got a picture, man.
- Let me see her picture. Shit.
- Can't even look at her, man.
Man, what the fuck
you mean, bro?
That's your little girl, man.
That's your baby.
You know how I survived
Because I don't think about the world,
Skip. That shit don't exist to me.
I don't give a fuck about anything
or anyone in it,
because the minute I do, I'm a dead man
out here, and you remember that shit.
We'll talk about the world
when we get back.
Yeah, whatever, man.
I'm gonna go get high.
I mean real high. And I'm gonna
get my dick sucked too.
Big dick. Big.
Very, very big.
Can you handle it?
"Hey there, Kirby. What's happenin'
back in the world?
If you hadn't heard,
doin' my second tour.
- Fire in the hole!
- Fire in the hole!
We spend most of our time
livin' in the bush.
Kind of numb to everything out here.
Tryin' to keep
my head clear.
Our lieutenant is this crazy
white boy named Dugan from Ohio.
- He's good at gettin' us
out of crazy situations.
- Look out.
We got this one wild-ass
brother out here named Cleon.
Gook fuck.
His daddy's this big-time
preacher, but you'd never know
from his crazy son.
Now you're good.
Now Jesus loves you.
He's from Mount Vernon.
Oh, yeah. You won't believe it,
but Skip volunteered
for my unit.
I don't think he's
cut out for recon.
He's always gettin' high and shit,
tryin' to keep his mind off things.
Me, I'm just tryin' to take it
one day at a time and do what's right,
whatever that is.
See you when I get
back to the Bronx.
Anthony."
That fuckin' shit stinks.
I don't wanna pull rank, Cleon, but if
you don't get rid of that fuckin' head...
I don't hear nobody else
complainin' but you.
Well, maybe you should
listen to your team.
Medical advice, Cleon:
You dump that shit.
Hey, Doc, shut the fuck up.
You don't know shit.
Fuck you, man. It stinks like
a sack full of assholes.
Ain't a one of us got as much as
a splinter in his finger
since I cut this head off.
This head is our
good-luck charm.
Nah, this here's
our good-luck charm.
If you don't mind, Sergeant, l...
My vote is to get rid of it.
Man, Cleon, you need to get the
fuck on with that bullshit, man.
That head smell like shit.
Bottom line,
Staff Sergeant:
You either get rid of that
fuckin' head A.S.A. fuckin' P.,
or I'm gonna have your ass
court-martialled when we get
back to the rear.
We clear?
- Cobra, Cobra, Delta six. Over.
- Delta six, Delta six, Cobra.
Copy. Over.
-  Cobra, Delta six.
X-G Charlie, Michael...
- We're in a world of shit now.
I just buried our luck.
Listen up. Change of mission.
A patrol from 25...
has found a shitload of weapons
in a vill about a klik
and a half to our whisky.
Platoon commander wants us
to interrogate on the spot.
Betancourt, you're the closest one in
the area that speaks that gook shit.
So that's where we're headin'.
All right, saddle up. We're movin' out.
- So now where's D'Ambrosio?
- He went to go take a shit.
- When?
- When Cleon was diggin' the hole.
- Why the hell didn't you go with him?
- You know how he is.
- He don't like nobody around
when he's shittin'.
- Oh, man.
Grab his shit.
Let's find him.
Aww.
Fuck! Doc.
- 360!
- D'Ambrosio, what'd they do?
- You'll be all right.
Doc's gonna take care of you, okay?
- Yeah.
This morphine is all
I can do for him right now.
Here, Doc. You can use mine
if that's not enough.
Are you crazy? Another one
of those would kill him right now.
What the fuck
you got there, Curtis?
Somethin' about
"Black men, go home."
"This isn't your war."
You get rid of that cocksucking
commie bullshit right now.
- Yeah. Right.
- Hey, Curtis.
- Apply some pressure here.
- We gotta hump this man
back to the rally point.
Oh, shit.
Save me, Curtis.
Look, Adam, you don't
worry 'bout nothin'.
We're a team,
okay, brother?
- We gonna take care of you.
- Please.
Yeah. It's not much longer.
We're almost there.
Kill me.
Kill me!
I would do it for you.
I would do it
for you, Curtis.
Buttermilk 17.

What'd you do over there?
What was it like?
Look, uh, I'd rather not

Well, Anthony, you're gonna
have to tell us something.
You know, a lot of them boys went over
there and got hooked on drugs and stuff.
Look. I was in
a special unit out there,
and bad habits could have
cost us our lives.
That's what I'm talkin' about,
them bad habits.
Now, if you picked up
some of them things,
there's a lot of places
you can go and get help.
No bad habits, Ma,
'cept a little killin'.
For my country,
of course.
Hey, let me give you some more of
these collards. Baby, this sure is good.
- All right.

Yeah. Look, uh, Kirby, uh...
I was thinkin', man,

What? Work for me?
Yeah. You know, runnin' numbers,
like we used to do.
Shh! Fuckin' pigs
run me outta business.
How the pigs run you outta business,
man? You had 'em on the payroll.
Pigs are greedy.
And you gotta remember,
I'm dealin' with the N.Y.P.D.,
greediest, most corrupt pigs
on the face of the Earth.
So I got
the fuck out.
I told that motherfucker I'd rather
eat cat shit with a knittin' needle.
I wasn't gonna bust my ass sendin'
some cop kids to college. Shit.
I dig it.
This place ain't never
made much money.
So... I'm just hustlin'
here and there.
Tryin' to get over
just like everybody else.
-
- It's gonna be all right, kid.
Here's to gettin' over.
-
- I hope, man. I hope.
- You afraid of blood?
- That's all I've been around
for the past three years.
"Anthony Curtis."
You related to Tony?
The actor?
N-No. Not... Oh!
No. The act...
No, no, no, no.
- Different colour, right?
- Yeah, he's a white cat. Yeah.
Yeah, and his name was Schwartz.
Schwartz, not Curtis.
-  Okay.
- You know anything about butchering?
Uh... I'm a fast learner.
Here, put that on.
Here. Take this.
