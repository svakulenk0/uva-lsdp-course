KELLY:
Come on, colonel.
- Get that jeep out of here.
MAN: Right, Kelly.
BIG JOE:
We' ve been here for two hours.
No, that's map section 3, not 4.
I don't give a damn what Command says
about anything.
Look, Mulligan, I don' t think
I'm getting through to you.
You' re dropping your damn barrage
on our position.
Sit and see.
You can't hear me?
The reason you can' t hear me...
...is because you're firing your mortar
at your end...
...and they're dropping here at our end.
No, the Krauts are not here. We're here.
Mulligan, your bombs are coming down
on our heads.
I don't know where the Krauts are.
Just lift your goddamn barrage. Over.
I told you to bring me some good-looking
kid, not this fat, sausage-chewing wino.
Well, if you were looking for a young boy,
you should' ve sent somebody else, Joe.
Mulligan, you son of a bitch.
Hey, Joe, it looks like they're trying
to push up the canal.
What do you want me to do
about it, Petuko?
The half-track's been wiped out.
- Eddie's been hit.
- Okay.
Go see what' s happening. Grace, Jonesey,
grab a litter and go with Corporal Job.
On the double.
Mickey Mouse.
- It's Mulligan.
- It's Mulligan. What the hell does he want?
He says he' s sorry.
BIG JOE:
Sorry. Son of a bitch.
Mulligan.
Big Joe's a little upset right now.
I think maybe you should leave town.
Get out of the neighborhood.
Right.
Does he speak English?
Yeah, he's a colonel in Intelligence.
Here.
As a big noise with the German Intelligence
you ought to be able to tell us about Nancy.
- Under the Geneva Convention you only...
- Sit down.
I'm not interested in defenses,
I'm interested in hotels. Okay?
Are there any still standing?
There are three.
Two are defended by units of...
And which is the most comfortable?
- I don't know.
BIG JOE: Hey, look.
Think of us as tourists.
I don't want any military information.
I just want to know the best hotel.
- I think it is called the Majestic.
- And who's the owner?
I can't remember his name.
All right, all right.
Checkthe Michelin Guide.
Now, what about women?
I must warn you. The German Army
is preparing a counter attack...
BIG JOE:
Sit down.
Look, we're not worried
about the German Army.
We got enough troubles of our own.
To the right, General Patton.
To the left, the British Army.
To the rear, our own goddamn artillery.
And besides all that, it's raining.
The good thing about the weather...
...it keeps our Air Corps
from blowing us to hell...
...because it' s too lousy to fly.
BIG JOE:
Okay.
Now, what about the broads in Nancy?
- Broads?
- The women.
Yes, there is a house.
I cannot give you the directions.
I've never been there.
Hey, here it is. "Nancy.
Principal attractions:
The Church of the Cordeliers tombs.
Woodwork and statues.
City Hall, 18th century,
with stairway and square reception room.
Palace Stanislas' impressive gates.
Porterie, Museum of Lorraine.
Charge to see..."
Will you cut the culture crap
and get to the hotels?
Majestic Hotel, three stars,
a knife and a fork.
Beautiful.
We keep this guy until we get to Nancy.
We can use him when we get to town.
- Hey, Joe.
BIG JOE: What do you want, Barbara?
The captain wants to see you.
"The captain."
I'll be right with you.
- What should I do?
- Stay on the radio.
Joe, I think we ought to send him back
for interrogation.
Look, nobody's copping out on this.
Do you understand?
The colonel serves a more strategic
purpose staying with us.
He needs interrogating,
then you do it right here.
Open the door.
- Hey, Joe. Do me a favor, will you?
- What do you want?
- What?
- Don't call me Barbara.
- That's your name, isn't it?
- But my name's Babra.
- Come on, will you?
- I only wanted to...
What are these, colonel?
- Just my orders and letters of transport.
KELLY: Mm.
Fisher?
- What are you transporting?
- Files.
What kind of files?
- Clerical.
- Clerical, huh?
Mind telling me
what you were doing in this area?
I needed petrol for my trucks.
The bombing.
Trucks won't move without petrol.
- What do you want, Kelly?
- Interpret these for me, will you?
What are these?
COLONEL: Lead bars.
- Lead?
Yes, the bag was supposed
to have been dropped in the water...
...in case of capture.
Unfortunately, you surprised me.
All these papers are about some kind
of convoy from France to Germany.
Code name is Tannenbaum.
- Travel reports are a shipment of...
- That's enough.
Thanks.
Colonel.
Come here, colonel.
Oh, Little Joe, give me that brandy,
will you?
LITTLE JOE: What for?
- Just give me the brandy.
Kelly, what do you want to give away
the good brandy to the Kraut for?
KELLY:
This way, colonel.
Over here.
Sit down on this bench.
I want you to have a drink.
- Under the Geneva Convention...
- This isn't Geneva, colonel.
I just want to have a nice sociable talk
with you, that's all.
Go ahead. Drink.
But I will not divulge
any further information.
Drink.
BABRA:
Oh.
BIG JOE:
You idiot. Hold it.
Come on, cover me.
Mitchell.
- Mitchell?
MITCHELL: Yeah?
Big Joe.
All right, you stay here.
- All right, where is he?
- Inside.
BIG JOE: Captain?
MAITLAND: Yeah, who is it?
It's me, Big Joe. Where are you?
I'm in here.
- What are you doing there, sir?
- I'm checking out the motor.
The motor? What for?
We' re pulling out. I want to see if
this boat's worth taking back to the base.
BIG JOE:
What about Nancy?
Third Army's taking over.
We go into reserve.
When they take Nancy,
we go back in the line.
Oh, wow. I don' t think you have the welfare
of your men at heart.
Now, look, this is a big town,
with a lot of passionate broads...
...great restaurants, feather beds
in rooms with hot water.
Look, captain, we've been rained on,
pushed on, bombed on...
...mortared on by Mulligan all the way
from the Normandy Beachhead.
I'm aware of that problem, sergeant.
You' ve been aware of that problem ever
since we got out of the water at Omaha.
Look, why is it that every time
we get to a town like Nancy...
...these guys with the clean uniforms
and the ties...
...get to ride in the trucks into town
and make their pitch?
The general says we pull out,
so we pull out.
Look, captain.
You can't let them do this.
I gotta get my men near broads before
they start freaking out with each other.
I'm aware that
that situation might be developing.
Think I could get this
in the hold of a B-17?
We' re point section
to the whole damn Army.
- Nancy' s our town, captain. Yeah.
MITCHELL: Hey, Joe.
There's a company of Germans
starting to push.
Relax, I'll be with you in a minute.
Captain.
We got it all figured out.
We even got a guide.
All we have to do is get in there.
Well, there's a couple of German
divisions say you can' t.
So we need a little help.
MAITLAND: The help I need is
to get this yacht out of here.
Get back to the barn. I'll do it myself.
Hey, look, captain, you're supposed to be
in charge of this outfit.
You' re doing such a good job.
Why should I get in your way?
Oh, God.
Hey, Cowboy.
Got a report that three tanks are coming
up the road. I suggest you get activated.
Hold her down there a bit, Willard.
The corporal's trying to tell us something.
Yes, sir. You're telling me what?
There are three tanks coming up the road.
I suggest you get activated.
Oh, now, come on, pal.
Ain' t you got any Shermans?
We' ve been polishing these things
for two days.
If we take them out there in that rain,
they' re gonna rust up on us.
Come on, don't give me a hard time.
Get off your ass, and get out there.
Yes, sir. I didn't mean nothing.
I was just trying to tell you how we're
feeling, ain't that right, Willard? Yee-haw!
LITTLE JOE: Hold the ground at all costs.
We' re a reconnaissance company.
It's not our job to hold the ground.
That's an Infantry job.
We' re supposed to go out
and find someplace...
...look at it and tell you
what the situation is.
I can tell you what the situation is.
It stinks.
It's wet, it's cold,
and we're under heavy fire.
Yes. Yes.
JOB: Are they sending up anything
to support us?
They say they haven't got anything.
We' ve been ordered to hold.
JOB: Hold. With what?
- That's what I told them.
- You think we ought to pull out?
- Huh?
You think we ought to pull out?
I don't know. Better wait for Big Joe.
Corporal, those aren' t Mulligan's mortars
coming anymore.
Those are German 88s.
Much as I like Big Joe, I don't want to
spend the rest of the war in a prison camp.
Besides which, I'm first-generation Italian,
they' d shoot me as a traitor.
The indications are the Germans
are coming and we're not gonna stop them.
With your permission I'm gonna pull the
vehicle to the other side of the canal.
Yeah, go on.
JOB: Penn, Fisher. Get that damn thing
out of here.
Okay, everybody.
We' re pulling out on the double.
Move that stretcher.
Goddamn it, Cowboy.
I don't know what you was talking about.
There ain't three tanks. There's about 20.
- Ain't that right, Willard?
WILLARD: Damn right.
Get that thing to the other side
of the canal, you maniac.
Well, that's what we was
figuring on doing. Ha-ha-ha.
Kelly, come on, we' re going.
You' re coming, ain't you?
- Go on ahead.
- All right, all right, good luck.
Okay, Penn, let's go.
Colonel.
How many more bars of gold like this
do you have in that convoy?
No, no, come on, speak English,
colonel, come on.
How many bars like this in your trucks?
- Fourteen.
- Fourteen what?
Thousand.
Fourteen thousand?
Whoo.
Colonel, whereabouts
is your convoy right now?
Where are your trucks? Hm?
- Clermont.
- In Clermont. Clermont?
Is the gold still in the trucks?
Whereabouts? Whereabouts is the gold?
In the bank. It is a bank.
Colonel. Wake up, wake up.
What about support units?
- Support units?
- Yeah, tanks.
Come on, tanks. Stuff like that.
Tanks. Huh?
Three Tiger tanks.
What about infantry?
What about infantry, colonel?
- Did you hear from headquarters?
- We've been ordered to hold.
I'll tell them when to hold.
The Third took over one hour ago.
- We're pulling out of here.
- Great.
- Where's Maitland?
- He' s salvaging a yacht.
LITTLE JOE: A yacht?
- A yacht.
- I'll see you about 10 miles down the road.
BIG JOE: Wait a minute.
- Is everybody across the bridge?
- Kelly's in the barn with that colonel.
- Did you tell him we're pulling out?
- We told him. He's crazy.
Tell Mulligan to give me three minutes
and then lay all the mortar into that barn.
- Understand?
- lf you say so.
You wait here.
Mulligan.
Come on, colonel. Come on.
Get up and sit right here.
Kelly. Half the German Army's
coming up the road.
In a few minutes, Mulligan' s gonna drop
- What the hell are you doing?
- Looking after the colonel.
Shoot him and let's get the hell
out of here.
- Shoot him, we don't get the gold.
- What gold?
KELLY: The gold that's in a bank
Mulligan, I said three minutes.
Come on, let's get out of here.
BIG JOE:
Kelly? You okay, Kelly?
KELLY:
Yeah, I'm all right.
BIG JOE: Come on, you nut.
Let's get the hell out of here.
Fisher. Petuko. Come on,
we're moving out. Moving out.
Moving out. Babra. Come on. Move it.
Get in, we' re pulling out.
Kelly, you nut. Come on.
Wait a minute, will you?
Will you wait a minute?
Listen to me a second.
It's not me, I tell you. It' s not me.
I can't tell one shell from another. They
all look alike. They all look alike, Kelly.
If it was me,
if I could tell, would I be here?
Would I be here?
I wouldn't be here, Kelly.
I'd be in the States checking out the duds.
I'd be out with all those broads.
- I'd be working in a factory.
- Relax.
Wait a minute. We've got to have
a little understanding around here.
How the hell do we ever get
any understanding around here, Kelly?
- Relax.
- You got...
Mulligan, I just want to
make a proposition to you.
A proposition?
Well, is it dirty, or just illegal?
Well, I want you
to set up a barrage for me.
I want you to lay down
a barrage for me, Mulligan.
Grid section 7,
right here at these crossroads.
Yeah, well, I gotta have a signed
operations order from the C.O.
I need an authorization.
You see, that's just the problem, Mulligan.
We don't have an authorization.
You don't have a...
Well, Kelly, without an authorization,
I can't help you.
I told you I had a proposition, Mulligan.
That's just what I meant.
A proposition.
Oh. Hm.
Yeah. Well, uh... Uh...
Why?
Why what?
Why...?
Why, uh... Why not? Heh.
You won't forget me now, will you?
Why, no. I won't forget, Kelly.
You' re a good man, Mulligan.
Yeah, Kelly.
Mm. Mm.
MAN 1: Come on. Come on.
MAN 2: Screw you, Mac.
MAN 1:
Come on, move it.
MAN 3:
Up yours, baby.
MAN 1:
Hey, hey, come on, get it out of there.
Come on.
Hey, come on. Come on,
come on, move it.
Come on. All right, come on, you guys.
Clear it out.
Come on, get the horse out of here.
Get on the side, will you? Come on.
Move it out, come on now.
Move it, move it.
Keep it going, boys. Move it through.
All right, keep it going. Let's go.
Come on.
A message from Captain Maitland.
- Did you read it?
- Yeah.
- What's it say?
- He wanted you to read it, Joe.
Take the underwear off your head, huh?
Enough is enough.
- We've been ordered to pull back.
- Huh?
We' ve been ordered to pull back.
Yeah, I heard.
BIG JOE:
All right.
We' ve been ordered back
to map reference 473, so let' s move it.
But my hair is still in curlers.
MAN 4:
That's telling them, Willard.
Come on, let's move it out.
MAN 5:
Hey, Joe, what about Nancy?
MAN 6:
Pack it up, let' s go.
Move them out, will you, corporal?
Where have you been?
- Checking a few things out.
- Like what?
I'm going after that gold, Joe.
That's what I thought.
Do you want in?
Do I want in?
Let me tell you something.
Let me make it nice and clear.
I got a job to do and that's to get you guys
to Berlin without getting killed.
We' ve been at the front end
of this war all the way.
If you whisper one word
about the gold to these guys...
...I'm gonna have you bounced so fast
your feet won't touch the ground.
- Now, do you understand that, Kelly?
- Yeah. Yeah, I understand.
You' d better fix up some transfer papers
for me, because I' m going.
With you or without you.
Okay.
MAN 7: Give me a hand down there.
MAN 8: What a bunch of shit this is.
Okay, sergeant, everything's secure
up here. I'm coming down now.
Hi, captain.
Sergeant, do you think I can get this yacht
to Paris by Sunday?
You didn't bring me to this farmhouse
to talk about this boat again?
I worked a deal with headquarters. I've
got three days' rest for you and the men.
Make sure they have a good time.
I gotta get this yacht to Paris
and pick up things for the general.
- And where do we spend this vacation?
- Right here, sergeant.
Are you kidding?
I'm not kidding. With a little imagination,
you can fix this place up.
Lay out a baseball diamond.
Run the water into the house.
Special service is coming by
with some magazines and paperbacks.
We' re 10 miles from the nearest town.
There's no action.
That's the beautiful thing
about this location. It' s quiet.
Get yourselves a suntan, a little rest.
In three days we're back in the line.
MAN:
Hey, captain.
- We're all ready to move out.
- Yeah, I'm coming. Go ahead.
There's no booze, there's no broads,
there's no action.
Another thing. Don' t fool around
with the women, their husbands carry guns.
And don't forget, the penalty
for looting is death.
Loot what? There's nothing here to loot.
I'll be back in three days.
"Get yourself a suntan
and get some rest."
He's gotta be out of his mind.
JOB: But how does he get away with it?
That's what I'd like to know.
BIG JOE: Very simple.
The general's his uncle, that's how.
There' s a girl with a heart
As big as...
- Crapgame?
CRAPGAME: What do you want?
I want to talk to you
for a couple minutes.
What about?
I have this deal I've been working on.
I thought you might be interested
in helping me out.
CRAPGAME:
What kind of deal?
A private deal.
CRAPGAME: Oh, yeah?
Hey, Harry, go get yourself a haircut.
I hear Maitland's got himself a yacht
and taking it to Paris.
That's right.
No money in yachts.
What does he want a yacht for?
Who cares, as long as it keeps him
out of our hair for a few days?
Okay, Kelly.
What is it? What is it you want?
Well, I want 15 Thompsons,
two.30 caliber machine guns...
...two bazookas, two field radios...
...and supplies and ammunition to last a
platoon of men in the field for three days.
- Oh. That all?
- Nope.
I want the Intelligence report
for this whole sector...
...and I need them in the next two hours.
That's nice. What' s in it for me?
- A piece of the action.
- What kind of action?
This kind of action.
Hello, Izzy? Yeah, it's me, it's me.
Listen, get me a quotation for gold
on the Paris market.
Yeah, now, and hurry it up.
How much more where this came from?
Fourteen thousand bars.
Fourteen thousand bars? Ha, ha.
Fourteen thousand.
Hey, sweetheart, have yourself a bottle
of booze, you're beautiful.
Fourteen thousand bars.
Zadda-bow-bow.
That's beautiful. Where is it?
In a bank.
In a bank?
You' re getting pretty ambitious,
aren't you?
I mean, to think you can blow a bank
and get away with it?
It's behind enemy lines.
Behind enemy lines.
Yeah. That could be the perfect crime.
Hello? Yeah. Yeah, lzzy.
Right. Right, I got you.
Let's see. Seven carry the two, gold, 54.
Hm. $1.6 million.
What else will you need?
ODDBALL:
You could probably use some armor.
CRAPGAME:
What are you doing up there?
- Hey, Crapgame.
- Who the hell' s that?
His name's Oddball.
I got three Shermans outside.
Yeah? What outfit?
Right now I don't have any outfit.
Who's your commanding officer?
He got decapitated by an 88
about six weeks ago.
But don' t say you're sorry.
He's been trying to get us killed
ever since we landed at Omaha Beach.
It's terrible.
He hasn't reported him dead yet.
You see, I' ve been collecting his whiskey.
We see our role
as essentially defensive in nature.
While our armies are advancing so fast...
...and everyone's knocking themselves out
to be heroes...
...we are holding ourselves in reserve...
...in case the Krauts mount a
counteroffensive which threatens Paris...
...or maybe even New York.
Then we can move in and stop them.
But for $1.6 million...
...we could become heroes
for three days.
A Sherman can give you
a very nice edge.
Where are these Shermans?
They' re outside.
Come on, I'll show them to you.
These are my boys.
And these are your tanks, huh?
- Yep.
- Yeah.
I mean, don' t let the dirt and the rust
hang you up.
We like to give the impression
that we're just out of action.
Badly in need of a period
of rest and reorganization.
That way nobody bugs us.
Come on, look at the engine.
This engine's been modified
by our mechanical genius here, Moriarty.
Right?
Whatever you say, babe.
These tanks are faster than any other tanks
in the European theater of operations.
Forwards or backwards.
See, man, we like to feel that we can get out
of trouble quicker than we got into it.
Any other secret weapons?
Yeah. I mean, like, you see,
all the tanks we come up against...
...are bigger and better than ours.
So that all we can hope to do
is, like, scare them away.
This gun is an ordinary 76 millimeter...
...but we added this piece of pipe onto it
and the Krauts think, like, uh...
...maybe it's a 90 millimeter.
We got our own ammunition.
It's filled with paint.
When we fire it, it makes pretty pictures.
It scares the hell out of people.
We got a loudspeaker here and when we go
into battle, we play music very loud.
It kind of...
...calms us down.
Come on inside for a minute.
If I hear any more threats
against Maitland' s life.
If I hear any more wild talk about going
to headquarters and killing the general.
Or raping nurses at the field hospital.
I'm gonna strangle the guy
with my bare hands.
Now, all good things
come to those who wait.
We' re gonna have a lot of fun here.
Aren't we, Cowboy?
- You can bet your boots on that, partner.
- Sergeant, partner.
- Right, Sarge.
- All right.
WILLARD: Joe?
- Yeah.
I think I' ve got the crabs.
We' re gonna boil our laundry.
We' re gonna set up a little shower area...
...so we can wash our little bodies.
Right, Barbara?
- Babra.
BIG JOE: Shut up.
Shave.
A little wine, women and song.
A little chiquita for you, Petuko.
It's gonna take time to get organized...
...but I want that farmhouse
to look like a nightclub. Little Joe.
I want you to set up a bar.
We ain't got no booze.
"We ain't got no booze."
Well, we' re going to get some booze.
I'm gonna go down to Battalion...
...see if I can lay my hands on some
dirty movies and when I come back...
...I want that farmhouse not only clean,
but completely decorated.
Do you understand that?
All right, corporal, fall them out.
Let's get moving.
$16 million.
- Kelly, I think I made a slight mistake.
- Hm?
It's not 1.6 million, it's $16 million.
- What a bundle.
KELLY: Yeah, all right.
We' re gonna need plenty of gasoline
on this trip.
You can handle getting it through
enemy lines?
- Just name the place, baby.
KELLY: Okay.
Right here. Grid section B.
Tonight at 2100 hours.
No good, man. The boys have got
something special on tonight.
Are you nuts?
What's more important than $16 million?
You come around tonight, Crapgame,
and we'll show you.
Okay.
Tomorrow night, then.
Along this road, same hour.
We'll be there.
- lf you' re late, we move out without you.
- lf we're late, it's because we' re dead.
CRAPGAME:
What about Big Joe?
You handle the supplies,
I'll take care of Big Joe.
CRAPGAME:
I'm going along to protect my investment.
KELLY:
You don't trust me.
A firm financial mind should be behind
an enterprise such as this.
There could be a bonus. Besides,
Switzerland' s only 100 miles away.
I don't want anybody getting lost.
Now, look, I don't want
half the Army in on this deal.
Don't want any friends or friends of friends.
I want to keep it a tight little unit.
Right, Oddball?
Oh, yeah, man. I mean, like...
No sweat, you know?
I'll pick you up in about an hour.
You can hang onto that bar of gold
as a deposit.
Who is that guy, Crapgame?
Oh. His name' s Kelly.
Used to be a lieutenant.
Pretty good, too, until they gave him orders
to attack the wrong hill.
Wiped out half a company of GI's.
Somebody had to get the blame,
and he got picked.
ODDBALL:
Oh, man, I don't like officers.
Neither does he, so relax.
Get me Hogan in Intelligence.
- Hey, Crapgame.
- Yeah?
You mind I take this bar of gold
and show it to the boys?
No, not at all. Just remember
where you found it. Bring it back here.
You' re a good boy, Crapgame.
Something's wrong with him.
Hello, Hogan? It's Crapgame.
I got you the scotch
and the nylons you wanted.
Yeah.
Do I ever fail you?
You better believe it. Never miss.
Listen...
...l, uh, got a little favor to ask of you.
Will you stop crying,
I haven' t even asked you yet.
What's the matter with you?
You wait here, padre.
I warned you, if you started anything,
I'd bust you out.
If you transfer me, Joe...
...you have to transfer every man
in this outfit.
I told you to lay off these guys.
Take it easy.
Kelly's got the whole thing figured.
Who invited you, Hustler?
- He did.
PETUKO: Hey, Joe.
It's a snap.
Did he forget to tell you
it' s behind enemy lines?
- I told them.
BIG JOE: Yeah?
Did you tell them how to get through
and cover 30 miles to Clermont?
- I told them.
- Then tell me.
Listen, Kelly's got it figured pretty good.
Listen?
This guy's gonna get you all killed.
We' re getting killed now, pal,
for $50 a month.
Damn right.
What good is a bonus gonna do
when you're dead?
The risk is the same we've been
taking since the beaches.
Only then you didn' t have a choice,
now you do.
Three days from now we're going back
into the line, Joe.
But this time we're doing it
for ourselves.
Kelly's even got us armor support.
BIG JOE:
What armor?
Three Shermans from the 321 st.
Who's in command?
It's a top-line outfit.
I personally recommend these guys.
You butt out. The only time you come out
of the ground is when you smell a profit.
I'm coming out now
because Kelly has the perfect caper.
For you it' s a vacation. Six days
out of seven you're behind the lines.
We' re at the broken end of a bottle
all the time, so you butt out.
Who's in command?
- Guy named Oddball.
- Oddball? He's a freak.
He's got three Shermans all ready to go.
What guarantee is that?
He's ready to go? He's a nut.
Well, we' re all nuts
or we wouldn't be here.
Hey, look.
Let me tell you guys something.
There's certain rules and regulations
governing the fighting of a war.
And the first one is that
you never stick your neck out for nobody.
Unless you're some kind of a hero type.
And I haven't seen any hero types
around here lately.
KELLY:
Talking's not gonna do any good, Joe.
These men are all going.
And who's gonna lead them?
If you don't, I will.
Just listen to Kelly for a minute, Joe.
He's got it all sewed, man.
The route, the timing,
the supplies, everything.
Sure.
Mm-hm.
What do you say, corporal?
Oh, I don't know, Joe.
I figure if I got to go, it might just as well
be this trip as the next one.
- Penn?
- I'm for it.
How about it, Cowboy?
I reckon I'm gonna have to go along
with it, Joe.
They' re all for it, Joe.
What happens when Maitland finds out
we're not here?
He'll figure we've been sent back
to the front lines.
LITTLE JOE:
Man, he never knows where we are anyway.
Okay, show me what you've got.
KELLY: The road's 10 yards beyond those
trees. Let me look at that map, will you?
What happens
if they put up road blocks?
Doesn't matter. All that matters
is Mulligan being on time.
Mulligan is on time.
On time and on target.
And he ain't ever been that yet.
Well, there's always a first time.
I figure the town is about
a quarter of a mile straight ahead.
- What happens if it isn't there?
- It better be. I went through it last night.
Only got a few minutes left,
so let's get moving.
Stick close to me, huh?
I don't want to be waiting on anyone.
We'll be there, Kelly.
All right. Move out, Cowboy.
BIG JOE:
Ooh. That nut has got to be nuts.
CRAPGAME: Everything all right, Kelly?
- Everything's all right.
You sure you got the time straight
with Mulligan?
Yeah, I got the time straight
with Mulligan.
Whether Mulligan can tell time or not
is another question.
Fire.
That crazy Mulligan' s dropping them
all over the place.
You mother.
- Joe. Come on.
- Shut up, you pain in the ass.
This man is the man I have
on my mind today.
I'll tell you who he is.
This is my opposite number.
General Bogel, commanding
the Second German Armored Division.
When I look at that face,
I can read that character.
This guy's a loser.
Here I am sitting in his headquarters.
I'm drinking his scotch.
Hell, I've even got one of his broads
hanging around here somewhere.
The guy' s a born loser...
...but you, gentlemen,
have not buried him yet.
You call yourselves leaders of men?
They' re putting up strong resistance.
Come on, Roach.
I flew over the battlefield this morning.
I could march a divisional dress parade
with band music right through their line.
- What about our flanks, sir?
- Aw, the hell with your flanks.
How many times have I got to tell you?
Forget about your flanks.
There's still a half a Panzer division
between here and Nancy.
Without gas. Without gas, gentlemen.
They' re getting gas, sir.
It's coming up at night.
- How?
BOOKER: By truck.
The Air Force has got my orders to blow
every bridge in this sector out of existence.
They' re doing it and the Germans
are rebuilding the bridges every night.
We' re supposed to blow them up
again in the daytime.
- Get me those aerial photographs.
- Right, sir.
General, last night someone gave orders
to redirect our mortar fire...
...against some damn crossroads.
Listen, Roach. I don't want any excuses
out of you, you hear me?
All I want is to know why this loser of a
general is keeping me the hell out of Nancy.
Sir, we haven' t got the supplies.
It's just a matter of logistics.
GENERAL: Logistics?
GUEST: Yes, sir.
We' ve got logistics
coming out of our ears.
What we need is fighting spirit.
The will to win.
Where are those aerial photographs?
I'm sorry. They don't seem to be here.
They don't what?
I can't locate them, sir.
Eh...
...did you lose my aerial photographs?
Well... It looks to me
like there ain't no bridges still up.
What's this here?
It's a bridge.
Looks like some kind of
railroad bridge, huh?
- Beautiful.
MORIARTY: Yeah.
Even if we make that...
...we've still got a river to cross later on.
Right over there.
Let Kelly worry about that. Our problem
is getting through German lines.
- Right?
- Right.
How?
ODDBALL: It's a railroad bridge, ain't it?
- Yeah.
Well, then, beautiful.
We swing down onto the railroad tracks
and right over the mother bridge.
"And over the mother bridge." Sure.
Suppose the bridge ain't there?
Oh, man.
Don't hit me with them negative waves
so early in the morning.
Think that bridge will be there
and it will be there.
It's a mother, beautiful bridge
and it's gonna be there.
ODDBALL:
Okay?
Okay, chief.
Okay.
Mount up.
JOB:
How many, Grace?
GRACE:
Eight.
JOB: Penn?
PENN: Seven.
JOB:
How many, Kelly?
Uh, three's fine.
Cowboy?
Oh, about six and I figure
about eight loose.
How about you, Willard?
WILLARD:
About the same.
How many clips did you use last night?
- About eight.
- Eight.
You' re trigger-happy, Gutkowski.
Here's two more.
Take it easy, okay?
Take it easy.
Want some K-rations, Crapgame?
No, thanks, kid.
I could use some water.
Do you got any water?
Mm, okay.
I'm gonna get some water, okay, kid?
Hey, uh, who are you writing to?
Your mother?
Yeah.
- Do you write often?
- Yeah.
- Where are you from?
- Indianapolis.
- Do you miss your mother?
- Yeah.
Good talking to you, kid.
Hey, Kelly.
- Kelly?
KELLY: Hm?
Big Joe wants to see you
over at the command jeep.
KELLY:
Oh.
Something wrong?
Yeah, just a few little things, Kelly.
According to this map...
...we got a river to cross before we get
into this town of yours.
Yeah, well, there's a bridge right here.
Six miles out.
There was a bridge.
The Air Corps knocked every bridge
out of that river months ago.
Unh-unh. Reports have the Air Corps
knocking them out by day...
...and the Germans rebuilding them
by night.
All we have to do is get there tomorrow
at dawn and we' ve got ourselves a bridge.
How about the German Army? Do you
think they'd mind us crossing their bridge?
Probably.
You know something, Kelly?
I think you're crazy.
Better yet, I think I'm crazy.
How did I let you talk these guys
into this?
Push 30 miles behind enemy lines,
take a bridge held by Germans...
...then go into a town that we don't know
how many German soldiers are guarding.
I figure there's between 30 and 40 troops
in that town.
All right. How did you figure that?
Well, uh, it's of no military importance.
It's not big enough for a garrison.
You still didn't answer the question, Kelly.
How did you figure 30 or 40 men?
Because that's the normal amount
of support for three Tiger tanks.
Tigers?
Where the hell
did the Tigers come from?
That's why we have Oddball
and his Shermans.
- Does he know about the Tigers?
- Not yet, no.
You bet your sweet ass he doesn't.
Or he'd still be on that funny farm of his.
He may be nuts, but he' s not crazy enough
to put Shermans up against Tigers.
Once these things get rolling...
...they're gonna blow that whole town
to pieces, including us, Kelly.
- You're too smart to let that happen, Joe.
- Oh, wow.
You'll figure us a way in and out
of that town.
I know you've got a good head
for tactics.
Oh, wow.
Yeah? And I intend to keep it right here
on my shoulders, Kelly.
With these Tigers, this operation goes
above and beyond the call of duty.
That's right, Joe.
Hey, look, Kelly.
You' re pressing these guys' luck.
They' ve only got so much of it left.
It's a long, long way to Berlin.
And they're gonna need every inch of that
luck before this cockamamie war is over.
Cover!
Come on, on the double.
Let's get the equipment out of the trucks.
On the double, move it out. Here.
Cover. Take cover.
CRAPGAME:
Hey. Hey.
That idiot's one of ours.
JONESY:
Holy crap.
Oh... Our hero.
Man, this is crazy, isn' t it, Willard?
GRACE: Get the number of that plane?
PENN: Who you gonna file a complaint with?
- Move it out, move it out.
PENN: Yeah, yeah.
- Still think we can make it, wise guy?
- We can still try.
Well, Oddball better show up, Kelly.
That's all I gotta say, he'd better show up.
Move it out.
All right, how is it?
Shot.
- There's a hole right through the cylinder.
- How about the radio equipment?
- The pack radio is okay. The rest has had it.
- Pick it up and take it with you.
- I got your equipment, Joe.
- Bring it.
I told you. We should've never gone in
on this deal.
- Well, you never told me.
- Yes, I did.
This why we pay taxes?
To be bombed by our own Air Force?
- Damn right.
- Hey, Kelly. Kelly.
What do we do now?
Pick up our equipment and get out of here
before a German patrol comes along.
Oh, that' s great.
BIG JOE: Let's move all that stuff
up to the wall, on the double.
- Everybody all right?
- I think so.
- What happened, Joe?
- What happened?
- Where the hell have you been?
- I had to go.
We all have to go.
Come on. We've got 20 miles to walk
and nine hours to walk it in, so move it out.
Big Joe? Do I gotta carry
all this equipment...
...this satchel charge
and this.30 caliber machine gun, too?
Give the.30 caliber to the Hustler.
He wants to be a hero.
Here you are, old buddy. Ha-ha-ha.
Thanks. Get yourself a bucket of grits.
All right, corporal, let's go.
Move them out. Move it out, Penn.
- Yeah, yeah, move them out.
- It's a long way.
All right, thank you. Move it out.
Kelly, get on the point.
How come you got me elected
to carry this?
You wanted in on this?
Then learn to carry your own load.
Come on, move it out.
Yeah, up yours.
ODDBALL: Take it easy, take it easy.
Take it easy. Okay, hold it. Hold it.
Looks like we've got
a military installation up ahead.
So make it the same deal as before.
We'll go into a triangular formation.
I'll go down the slot.
Moe, you go down the right flank.
Whiskey, down the left. Keep it tight.
Don't break it up until I give you the word.
Okay, button up and let's go.
The flowers are blooming
It's a beautiful day
There' s a girl with a heart
As big as the sky
She's sunshine
And I know why
Fire.
All for the love of sunshine
Fire.
Whoa!
Hit it.
All right, lay four rounds in there heavy.
Come on, move it. Fire.
Hit it.
Fire.
Bring him around hard.
Hit it.
Fire.
Every time I go to town
A boy started kickin' my dog around
It makes no difference if he is a hound
You better stop kickin' my dog around
Go on, Blue
You good dog, you
BIG JOE: All right, Petuko.
PETUKO: Right, Joe.
Move them out, corporal.
Let's go, Babra.
Wake up, Gutkowski. Let's go.
Let's go, Kelly.
All right, Hustler, let's go.
MITCHELL:
Hey, Kelly.
This was your idea. How come
we don't go back to our own lines?
It's further back to ours
than it is to where we' re going.
I know what, let's surrender. I' m hungry.
Come on.
All right. I buy it.
I'll make it $50
if you carry the machine gun, huh?
You got it on you?
- Don't you trust me?
- No, I don't.
What do you think I am, a vault?
You think I carry money?
I ask you a favor
and you don't want to help me?
All I asked you is to carry
the machine gun. I'll give you $100.
JONESY: Do you have it?
CRAPGAME: No, I don't have it on me.
ALL:
Shut up.
CRAPGAME:
Ah, you guys keep quiet.
It's still up.
No, it ain't.
You see what sending out
them negative waves did, Moriarty?
That ain't my fault, Oddball.
I've done nothing but have good thoughts
about that bridge ever since we left.
What happens now?
It looks like we're gonna find ourselves
another bridge.
Where are we gonna come up
with another bridge?
There you go, more negative waves.
Have a little faith, baby.
Have a little faith.
ODDBALL:
Now go on, get down into your hole.
Move out.
Corporal Roamer speaking.
Hey, Sarge. It's Oddball.
All right, watch my outfit.
Yeah.
Woof, woof. Woof, woof.
Don't try to be funny, Oddball.
What do you want?
I'm telephoning you from a café
about 10 miles south of Mesurier.
I wondered if you could do me a favor.
Mesurier?
I got a map here someplace that says we
haven't even captured that place already.
Yeah, so I heard.
Everybody seems very friendly.
Look, baby, I'm kind of hung up.
I need about 60 feet of bridge.
How am I supposed to get 60 feet of
bridge 10 miles behind the German lines?
I'm about to put you onto something good
and you are giving me your problems.
This sector's so screwed, nobody knows
where the German lines or our lines are.
I got through with no problem.
I've got a bank back here with 16 million
waiting to be picked up. Are you in?
Listen, they haven't got you back
in the nut ward again, have they?
Bellamy. For crying out loud.
That is the lousiest, stinking,
most awful, stupid joke.
You' re always pulling
that stinking, awful, stupid joke.
You don't want in this thing, don't get in.
I cut you out of everything.
I don't need you, 60 feet of bridge,
I can pick up almost anywhere. Schmuck.
BELLAMY:
All right, all right, all right.
Look, with three tanks, it's easy.
With a 60-foot bridge it's something else.
I need support units, Oddball.
I need at least 100 guys.
Where do I find 100 men, just like that?
CRAPGAME :
Eighteen miles to...
Jerks.
I couldn't have blown 13, 18, 14,
switch the other guys. Aah.
- Joe.
- Shut up.
We' ve walked into a minefield.
- All right, who bought it?
- It's Grace.
KELLY:
Joe.
There's a road right up here
at the edge of the field.
You mark that spot
and you head for the road.
Everybody.
Take out your bayonets...
...and move towards Kelly.
Corporal.
Move the men down slowly.
- Mitchell?
MITCHELL: Yo!
BIG JOE: You pick up Grace' s B.A.R.
and head this way.
Jonesey, for Christ' s sake, stand still.
Corporal?
Go see if Grace is still alive.
Jonesey, will you get the hell down?
- Looks all right up here.
- Right.
All right, you guys,
keep it moving. Stay careful.
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, I found one.
What kind is it?
The kind that blows up.
How the hell do I know what kind it is?
Mark the spot and keep moving, Hustler.
I'll mark it.
Gutkowski, get down there
on that bend and keep an eye out.
Okay, bring the B.A.R.
KELLY: Penn, get that.30 caliber set up
the other side of the wall.
PENN:
Right.
I could' ve been in the States
playing Ping-Pong, volleyball...
...plenty of broads.
Who the hell needs all this?
I'm gonna get my knife
and get the hell out of here.
Damn lousy equipment.
Now I got to lift up this cannon.
Carry it all the way
to the front line someplace.
The damn thing is heavier
than Kelsey's burgers.
Sure, I'll get a rupture yet
with this damn thing.
BIG JOE:
Move it now.
On the double, across the road.
Go ahead, Babra,
stay on Kelly's path all the way.
On the double.
Come on, Hustler. Move it.
It's all safe for you, now.
"Move it." I hope you have
to take the gas pipe. You creep.
- Stay on Kelly's path the whole way.
- Go to hell.
BIG JOE:
Let's go, Cowboy. Move it.
COWBOY:
Come on, Willard. Let' s mount up, boy.
Anything we can do for you, corporal?
No, thanks, Cowboy. We're all right.
- Come on, Willard. Hit it.
WILLARD: I'm ready.
Hey. Hey, Kelly.
How did we get talked into this mess?
It took 10 seconds to talk you into this.
But we were supposed to ride, not walk.
Nobody said anything about mines...
...or schlepping this machine gun
all over the country.
Quit your bitching and just remember
what's at the end of the line.
GUTKOWSKl:
Kelly. Kelly.
Joe, there's a patrol coming in.
All right, Kelly, spread them out
across the road.
Move it. Your crabs will leave you now.
KELLY: Get that gun set up
on the other side of the wall.
Move.
BIG JOE:
Move it, Petuko, move it.
- Don't forget about the broads.
- You horny bastard.
Sergeant? Get the hell out of there.
Corporal. You'll never make it.
We'll cover you from the road.
- Don't move unless they spot you.
- Right. Go on.
Set up the B.A.R. there, Mitchell.
All right, stay down, load up.
Stay down, load up.
Stay down. Stay down, hold your fire.
Fisher. Grenades.
- Let' s get out of here. Let' s go back.
JOB: Take it easy.
It's too late, now.
We' re better off here, anyway.
Get your head down.
Nice and easy.
Stay down.
All right. Get ready.
Hold it.
Fire.
Let's go.
- Jam.
- Clear it.
Let's move it out.
All right, you heard me.
I said, move it out.
Maybe they' re only wounded.
They' re dead, so forget it. Let's move.
BABRA:
Hey.
Hey.
There's a whole column
of Shermans coming over the hill.
BIG JOE: Go get your packs.
Pick up your equipment.
Go on down and load up.
Ready.
Fire.
I thought you said three Shermans.
Those nuts have brought half the Army
with them.
Okay, keep a move on.
Let's keep on coming.
Come on. Okay, move on out.
Are you ready for this?
Split how many ways, stupid?
Come on, Willard.
What is this, huh? What is this,
a ball game? Who are these guys?
They' re my friends, Crapgame.
CRAPGAME:
Friends? Where'd you find them?
Here and there.
- There's a bunch of refugees over there.
- It's a band.
A band? What do we need a band for?
Have a little faith, Crapgame.
They' re beautiful people.
Kid, pull yourself together.
We ain't in the middle of Central Park.
KELLY:
Oddball.
How do you figure on moving through
enemy terrain with a column a mile long?
Easy. We can fight. We got an army.
Those freaks? That ain't an army,
it' s a circus.
Take it easy, Big Joe.
Some of these people
have got sensitive feelings.
- Who's the guy in charge?
- I am.
BELLAMY:
What's the deal with the gold?
Any man who gets to the town
and hits the bank, gets an equal share.
But don' t try to cross us.
There's gonna be trouble.
- Who's going to make it, boy?
- I am.
- Well, get out and start it.
KELLY: Take it easy, big mouth.
You get out of here.
Everybody else up on the tanks.
BIG JOE: Come on, let's move out.
- Don't double-cross us.
- Any double-crossing will be your fat lip.
- Get moving.
BIG JOE:
Shut up.
KELLY:
Everybody up on that tank. Let's go.
Kelly, we're not going
with those cowboys, are we?
We got $16 million up for grabs and we're
not gonna let those clods beat us to it.
- Now, let's get moving.
- Yeah, yeah.
I say, Booker? Booker.
BOOKER:
Yes, sir?
GENERAL:
The old man was just on the line.
He says I've broken through
a long and entire front.
Why wasn' t I told?
I don't know, sir.
You' re the communications officer,
ain't you?
You' re supposed to be able
to communicate.
Who's broken through
and how far have they gone?
Well, no one has, sir.
It seems someone's found a hole
in the right flank.
They' re trying to push elements
of the 321 st and the 35th into it.
"Seems," Booker?
"Elements of the 321 st and 35th"?
Who's pushing them in there,
and where the hell are they?
I don't know, sir.
I'm coming down there, Booker.
What's the sense of a communications
officer who can't communicate?
Communication? He's more
like a damn military censor.
I'm back from Paris.
I got everything you wanted.
All I want is to know
whether we have broken through or not.
It's hard to say for certain, sir.
Nothing' s been confirmed yet.
We' ve intercepted some signals...
...that suggest some kind of action
at a bridge near Clermont.
- Is that Clermont, Booker?
- Yes, sir.
Then why in the hell didn't you say so?
That's 30 miles beyond their lines.
You got them on the radio?
Yes, sir, but it's hard to pick them up
clearly, sir...
...this time in the morning.
Something to do with the ionosphere.
Get the ionosphere the hell off the air
and get them on.
Get out of there.
Do something else. Let me in.
- What's the frequency?
- 300 KC, sir.
You' re not gonna find them easy
to follow.
- They're using some kind of code.
- What kind of code?
Words like "bank heist, crapgame, big joe,
little joe, oddball..."
CRAPGAME : Hey, can
anybody get rid of that machine gun for me?
- There, yes, sir, there. That's it, that's them.
- Where?
There. Right on 300, sir. Right there.
There they are, sir. Those are the signals
we've been picking up.
Shut up and let me listen
to what they're saying?
ODDBALL: Put Kelly on. Over.
CRAPGAME: Wilco. Over.
KELLY:
Oddball, this is Kelly.
ODDBALL: Hey, Kelly, what the hell's
going on out there, man?
KELLY: It's cleared of infantry. What do
you hear from those other two tanks? Over.
No chance, man. They've both had it.
One's in the river, the other' s burning.
Yeah, I can see them from here. Over.
Where's Big Joe?
KELLY: Over on the other side. Get off
the line, I'll get in touch with him.
Fire. Okay. Over and out.
KELLY:
Kelly to Big Joe. Kelly to Big Joe. Over.
CRAPGAME: Kelly, it's Crapgame.
What' s happening there? Over.
They' re dropping artillery
all over the place. That' s what's happening.
Where's Big Joe? Over.
He's not here. He's pinned down
under the bridge. Over.
- Well, get him for me. Over.
CRAPGAME: Okay.
Damn. Are we losing them?
We just had them good a minute ago.
I'm doing it, Booker.
Quiet.
What do you want me to do with this?
Get the hell out of here.
We' ve got the game on.
BIG JOE:
Kelly, this is Big Joe.
It's pretty clear over here,
except for the artillery.
The bridge is too far gone to get vehicles
across. You can bring the men over by foot.
KELLY:
Get them moving. Over.
Okay, I'll send them over
in twos and threes. Out.
Petuko, Willard, drop your packs
and take the equipment across the bridge.
Kelly, what did Big Joe say?
Says he' s sending them across.
Tell him to hurry up.
It's getting hotter than hell here.
- What's going on?
- We're crossing over.
- You're not crossing over without us.
- Then grab your trucks and come on up.
- That bridge is too badly damaged to hold.
- You want to come, fix it.
Half my equipment's jammed up
in the rear.
Un-jam them. We've lost two tanks already.
I'm not sticking around to lose a third.
Listen, we made a deal.
Not with me, you didn't. Here. You talk
to Kelly. Cowboy, stay with the truck.
- Right.
MAN: Ready?
This is Bellamy for Kelly. Kelly?
We can't use the bridge.
We can't ford the river. The bed's too soft.
BELLAMY: So what do we do?
- Go, team, go. Go.
KELLY:
You've got bridging equipment. Over.
That's a five-hour operation.
Can you hold on for five hours? Over.
No, no. Move. On, on. Move.
Bellamy, we're not gonna hold on
for five minutes. You can catch up.
Kelly, we're all in this together.
You can't go it alone. Over.
We' re not gonna wait five hours, either.
If you can' t keep up, that's your problem.
Now, we're pulling out
and we're pushing forward. Over.
Attack. Attack. Attack.
That's the fighting spirit
I was talking about. Listen to that guy.
- lf he was a major, he's a colonel now.
MAN: Kelly.
This is a Grave Diggers Registration
Unit. We got a stake in this advance, too.
Did you ever hear enthusiasm
like that in all your life?
They' ve even got the damn Grave Diggers.
What the hell am I doing here?
Bonsor. Get me my uniform.
ODDBALL: Get on!
MAN 1: Wonder where Cowboy is?
MAN 2:
Give me that gun.
LITTLE JOE:
Break up that radio.
Faster, faster.
Hurry up, you guys,
we haven't got much time.
ODDBALL:
Get up.
MAN 3:
Crapgame, do you like the Army?
ODDBALL:
Let's go. Let's get out of here.
All right, let's move them out.
- This is it, Penn. We' re on our way, baby.
MAN 4: Cowboy, come on. Hurry up.
MAN 5: Here we go.
MAN 4: Come on.
MAN 6: Come on, Cowboy.
This train's leaving, boy.
MAN 7:
Somebody grab that radio.
MAN 8:
There you go. Come on, up, up.
Attaboy, come on.
MAN 9:
That's it.
Booker, tell General Castle
that I want every man in this Army...
...on the road within the hour.
- Yes, sir.
I'm pushing on to the Rhine.
But, sir, Clermont' s 30 miles
behind enemy lines.
That you, Maitland?
MAITLAND:
Just back from Paris, sir.
Get my vehicle and driver around here.
Bonsor, you get my box of medals.
I'm gonna decorate every man in this
penetration, whoever they are.
They saved the reputation
of this entire Army.
You' re supposed to fight this battle.
You don't even know where it is.
I'll tell you where it is. It's 30 miles
beyond where you thought it was, Booker.
Come on, now, let' s get this Army of mine
back in the war.
BOOKER:
Will you send that?
Think you ought to wait,
let the Army get there?
History waits for no man. I' ve got an
appointment with destiny in Clermont.
Take this weapon, Maitland.
All right, boy. Make this thing fly.
- General, your medals.
- Good luck, sir.
COWBOY: Kelly?
KELLY: Yeah, Cowboy?
Kelly, we're in the bell tower
of the church.
You can see the whole town
from up here, almost.
There's not much happening.
I think they're still asleep.
COWBOY: There' s three Tigers
in the square right down below us.
Do you see anything
that looks like it might be a bank?
COWBOY: Yeah, it's got to be this building
here to the right of us.
Can you see it from where you are?
They' ve got two machine guns
and guards on the roof.
KELLY: I don't think I can see much
of the center of town from up here.
No, just a lot of rooftops
and bombed-out buildings.
Beside the tanks, can you see anything
that might house support units?
There's a big brown building
right behind the bank with a jeep...
...and two guards and about three trucks.
Hold it.
There's a German officer walking around
the bank towards the brown building.
KELLY:
Well, what do you think?
COWBOY: We shouldn' t have trouble
unless it' s with the Tigers.
We can take the machine gunners
on the roof from here.
If you can keep them guys busy
for a while.
Or maybe we can go down
and get a closer look.
No, stay there. Keep an eye out.
See if you can find out
where those troops are housed.
COWBOY:
Right.
What do you think, Oddball?
ODDBALL: It's a wasted trip. Nobody said
nothing about locking horns with Tigers.
Look. You just keep those Tigers busy,
and we'll take care of the rest.
Ha, ha. The only way I got to keep the Tigers
busy is to let them shoot holes in me.
We just want you to keep them interested
for a while, that's all.
Man. You guys are crazy.
When we was in the bocage country,
we was assaulted by them Tigers.
You know what I mean by "assaulted"?
Well, I mean assaulted.
Why don' t you knock it off
with them negative waves?
Why don' t you dig
how beautiful it is out here?
Why don' t you say something righteous
and hopeful for a change?
Crap.
KELLY: All right, so it' s a beautiful day.
Now, let' s get down to cases.
The Tiger is an open-country tank.
We happen to have these in a small town
with narrow streets.
- And we do have the element of surprise.
- Yeah.
Look, Kelly, a Tiger has
only one weak point. That' s its ass.
You gotta hit it point blank
and you've gotta hit it from behind.
We do not have
the element of surprise.
They'll hear our Detroit motors
long before we even get inside that town.
What if I show you a way to get
into that town so they don't hear you?
CRAPGAME:
Hey, Oddball?
This is your hour of glory,
and you're chickening out.
To a New Yorker like you,
a hero is some type of weird sandwich.
Not some nut who takes on three Tigers.
KELLY: Nobody's asking you to be a hero.
ODDBALL: No?
Then you sit up in that turret, baby.
No. Because you're gonna be up there,
baby.
And I'll be right outside
showing you which way to go.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Crazy. I mean, like, so many positive waves,
maybe we can't lose. You're on.
- You guys got anything?
- No, not much.
They just keep coming and going
from the brown building behind the bank.
- Cowboy?
COWBOY: Yeah?
In 20 minutes, start ringing that bell.
KELLY: And keep ringing it
as long as you can. Got it?
Right, Kelly.
KELLY: Five minutes after that bell starts,
you get the guards on top of the bank.
COWBOY:
Okay, Kelly.
All right, let's move out.
Kelly?
Kelly. Kelly.
- Hold it.
- Hold it.
KELLY:
Cowboy?
Yeah, Kelly, where in the heck are you,
man?
We' re just outside of town.
How's it look up there?
Well, it doesn't look too good from here.
They' ve got all those Tigers fired up
down there.
Looks like they're getting ready
for some heavy-duty action.
COWBOY:
I think we ought to pull out of here, pal.
No, stay right there. What do you think?
That's just routine.
The Tigers turn their engines over
for, like, 20 minutes every three, four hours.
Just routine, Cowboy. You stay put.
Routine?
Boy, I sure hope you're right, Kelly.
Our asses are gonna be hanging out
up here if you ain' t. I'm not kidding.
Nothing' s gonna be hanging out.
Now, just relax. Out.
- Sure you're right about those Tigers?
- Sure, I'm right.
If those engines are turning over,
we can sneak right up the edge of town.
- Nobody would hear us. Right?
- Right.
Shall I move out?
Good man.
Move out.
Babra.
Shh.
BIG JOE:
Psst.
All right.
Shh.
CRAPGAME:
Come on.
- Hold it.
ODDBALL: Whoa, whoa.
Stay here, until I signal you.
I'm mounting up, partner.
Now, don't you get lonely up here
without me, now, you hear?
ODDBALL: All right, let's go.
Switch it on and move it out.
- Hold it.
- Hold it.
Give me that hand radio.
Gutkowski? Gutkow...
The bell's making so damn much noise,
he can't hear.
I thought that was what you wanted.
So the Germans can' t hear us.
Now, move them out. Slow.
ODDBALL:
Move out. Slow.
Now.
KELLY: Hold it. Hold it.
ODDBALL: Hold it.
ODDBALL:
Hold it.
It's a Mark 6. And we got it by the ass.
Fire.
Aah!
Stay down.
All right, move out.
Let's go.
KELLY:
All right, get out of here.
ODDBALL:
Moving out.
WILLARD:
Crapgame?
CRAPGAME:
Yeah.
Over there.
Come on, you idiot.
Hey. Hey, you jerk. Hey.
Hey, will you knock it off
with those cockamamie bells?
Kelly told me to ring them.
I know he told you, but they know
we're here already. So, knock it off.
God Almighty. Whoo. Phew.
You guys smell like you fell
into a dung heap.
It kind of makes you homesick, don't it?
- It does kind of, don't it, old buddy?
- Yeah. Heh.
Pull it.
- Let' s go.
- All right, move out.
ODDBALL:
All right, ready to turn right.
Turn.
Now, hold it.
Fire.
- Wow.
- That's paint.
ODDBALL:
Load up.
Okay? Fire.
WILLARD:
Hey.
We need explosives to get these open.
This place is built like Fort Knox.
Cowboy, check around and see
if there's a back door.
Can you see anything?
There's a big lump
in the middle of the floor.
There's a Tiger coming down the street.
Cowboy. Cowboy, come here.
WILLARD: Get ahold of his arm.
COWBOY: Take it easy, boy.
Easy, easy does it.
WILLARD: Don't tell me to take it easy.
You take it easy.
Hi, man.
What are you doing?
I'm drinking wine and eating cheese,
and catching some rays. You know?
What's happening?
The tank' s broken
and they're trying to fix it.
Why aren't you helping them?
Oh, man.
I only ride them,
I don't know what makes them work.
Oh, creeps.
Definitely an anti-social type.
Arf, arf, arf, arf!
That's my other dog imitation. Mm-hm.
- Where did he get it?
- Well, he got it right here in the leg.
- Anything else?
- What do you mean?
Ain' t that enough for you?
- How do you feel, Hustler?
- Great.
Since when did you give a damn
how I felt?
Okay, wise guy, forget it.
Hey, Joe.
- Yeah?
- Come here.
What do you want?
How are things going with the bank?
Nothing.
The Sherman's broken down and nobody's
gonna move that Tiger out of the square.
- Then make a deal.
- What kind of a deal?
A "deal" deal.
Maybe the guy's a Republican.
Business is business.
Right?
Okay, big mouth.
Come on, Jonesey.
Get it going. Let' s go. Get it going.
Come on, let's go. Get in there.
Come on.
Come on, let's go. Roll it in there.
Bellamy, come on.
We' re almost finished.
- What?
- It's ready.
Right. Okay, let's go.
Let's move it out here.
Come on, bring them around.
Ten-hut!
Where are you from, sergeant?
Jersey City.
Stand up straight
when the general speaks to you.
GENERAL:
Don't you feel bad about it.
You' re a hell of a soldier,
and I just want to shake your hand.
All America's real proud of you today.
All right, come on.
I got a medal here in the jeep for you.
A medal?
It's shot, Kelly.
Maybe we can use the fuel pump
from that Tiger.
No, it won't work on this motor.
- Mechanical genius.
MORIARTY: Oh, man.
Oddball, I can' t make it work without
the parts no matter how positive I think.
This guy in the Tiger, the least we could
do is get him on the radio and talk to him.
Are you crazy?
That guy' s gotta be a full fanatic freak.
Otherwise he would've split
Hey, all this guy is doing
is guarding the bank like he was told.
Yeah, maybe.
But I wonder if he knows what' s in it.
- Cigarette?
COMMANDER: No smoke.
The fuel system is rotten.
We have gasoline all over the place.
It's all right.
Hey, look, uh, Max...
...you and us, we' re just soldiers, right?
We don't even know
what this war's all about.
All we do is we fight and we die.
And for what?
We don't get anything out of it.
In about a half an hour, the American
Army's gonna be coming down that road.
Why don' t you do yourself a big fat favor
and get the hell out of here?
I have orders.
This bank isn' t to fall into the hands
of the American Army.
This bank's not gonna fall in the hands
of the American Army.
It's gonna fall in our hands.
You see, we're just
a private enterprise operation.
You the American Army.
No, baby, we ain' t.
You know what's inside that bank, man?
There's $16 million worth of gold
in that bank, sweetheart.
ODDBALL:
Mm-hm. Mm-hm-hm-hm.
That's about 65 million marks.
KELLY:
And, sergeant...
...all you have to do to have an equal share
of this money...
...is crank this turret around
and blow a hole in that door.
Whoo.
Woof, woof, woof!
Wow.
Woof, woof! Woof!
I told you.
Wow.
No more payments.
You got it. Hit it. Ha-ha-ha.
COWBOY:
Come on, Little Joe.
What are you going to do with yours?
Get me a new Hudson
with an electric shift.
I'm going to get me a ranch in Texas,
with about 10, 20, 35 women...
...and let it go. Ha-ha-ha.
- I told you it'd work, I told you.
- No, you never told me.
- You never told me.
- Come on, Babra, keep it moving.
PENN: One Cadillac coming up, Willard.
- No, I'm getting a pickup truck.
Woof, woof, woof! Woof, woof, woof!
Okay, Crapgame, we got our cut,
I'm moving out.
Right. Take it easy, kid.
See you, Big Joe.
Heh. Okay. Stay lucky, you nut.
Mmm. See you, babe.
These are getting heavy.
- Buy you a lot of broads.
- I'll drink to that.
Come on, let's go. Move it out.
Come on, Babra, keep it moving.
We have small car full.
We go now.
Yeah. You take care of yourself now, huh?
Thank you.
MAN 1:
Come on, we gotta get out of here.
Cowboy, come on.
MAN 2: Move it.
MAN 3: I got it, let's go.
Hold.
Eh? See? What did I tell you, huh?
Now look, Oddball. The trade
for the uniforms I can understand.
But to buy this tank, you gotta be crazy.
It's a mother, beautiful tank.
It's a piece of junk.
The fuel system leaks all over the place.
It's a piece of junk.
Always with the negative waves,
Moriarty.
Always with the negative waves.
Crap.
- Joe. Joe.
BIG JOE: Yeah.
The general's on the edge of town,
right this minute.
Okay, Gutkowski.
You go help with the gold.
- Hey. Hey, hey. Hey, Fisher?
- Yeah, what do you want?
Listen, after splitting with Oddball and
the Germans we should have 125 boxes.
At $8400 a box.
That's how much?
That's 10,500,000.
Correct. Split 12 ways?
Very good, Fisher. You win a cookie.
Thanks.
BIG JOE:
Thank you very much.
I just wanted you to know
that we appreciate it very much. All of us.
And we...
The general's coming. Eisenhower.
Eisenhower. That' s right. Yeah.
You don't understand.
De Gaulle. De Gaulle.
De Gaulle.
The General de Gaulle is coming.
Right now. De Gaulle.
- De Gaulle. De Gaulle.
- De Gaulle.
- De Gaulle.
- De Gaulle.
MAYOR:
De Gaulle.
All right, keep it moving.
Kelly, come on, Kelly, move it.
The cavalry's coming down the road.
Give us a hand.
- What are they saying, Maitland?
- They seem to think you' re de Gaulle.
De Gaulle? He ain't even in this war.
Hey!
Victory.
MAN 1: Ha-ha-ha. Cowboy, we did it.
- We got it. We did it.
MAN 2:
We did it.
