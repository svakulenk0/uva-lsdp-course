- Are we there, yet?
- Almost.
Wait, we're not doing that "blindfolded
surfing" thing again, are we?
'Cause that didn't exactly end up
being one of your better ideas.
First of all,
that buoy had no business being there.
Second of all, no,
we're not going surfing.
At least, not yet.
Okay. Do you recognize it?
- No.
- No?
Unless it's the grassy clearing
in Dolphin's Cove,
right by the lifeguard tower,
which happens to be the exact spot
we met three months ago to this day.
To the minute, actually.
At the beginning of
what's turned out to be
the most bodacious summer of my life.
Even the part when we got trapped
in a 1960s beach movie.
Brady, it's beautiful.
I had to do something cool
for our meet-iversary.
It all happened right here.
You were walking on the beach.
I sat there watching
on my tablet.
And I thought, "Who is the surfer dude
with the shiny hair?"
And you said...
"Wanna watch
the awesomest movie ever made?"
And I said,
"I don't think awesomest is a real word.
"And even if it was,
that movie's definitely not it."
Then I said, "Check it out with me.
"If you don't have a good time,
I'll buy you a mango smoothie.
"Either way, you win."
- And...
- And I do love mangos.
Yeah.
You did all this for me?
I'd swim to China for you.
Or Hawaii.
Or whatever's that way.
I have no idea what's that way.
You ready?
Mmm-hmm.
TANNER ON VIDEO: In a way,
it's almost too bad it's almost all over.
BOTH:
ALL:
Five, six, seven, eight.
Some cats like that vroom vroom
need for speed
BOTH: And some dawgs like
that chill, chill ocean breeze
Whoo!
Yeah.
And you might be
the bubble to my gum
Whoo!
Thought it's cool
to own the beach alone
But it's hotter
Electric when we're close
-
-
We can't stop singing
'cause the surf's up
I'm falling for ya
'cause you're surf crazy
- Bye-bye.
- So long.
Toodle-oo.
Later gator.
-
-
-

BRADY: Hurry up.
The best summer ever!
MACK: Race you!
Oh, it's a shame
summers in real life have to end.
Summer's not over, yet.
We could light a bonfire,
eat some s'mores, tell scary stories.
We could...
Brady, tomorrow's
the first day of school.
I've got tons to do.
Yeah, I do, too.
Actually, no, I don't.
If I manage to put my board shorts on
tomorrow morning,
I'll be pretty stoked with myself.
Mack, you think
things will be different for us at school?
Well, we were in school
all last year together.
And we never met. That's my point.
We've only known each other
in the summer.
Brady, it's us. We'll be fine.
Yeah. Totally.
No. No, no, no, no, no, no. No.
What's wrong?
My necklace.
The one that Lela gave me.
The only thing I have
from
- It's gone.
- Maybe it's still nearby.
- Should I dive for it?
- No, Brady.
There's nothing we can do now.
I'm sorry.
I should probably go in.
Yeah. Sure.
DEVON: Whoo!
Whoo! Windy Bluff! Yeah!
First day back!
Oh, no way!
Yo, dude-man!
First day of school.
Wham, wham. Bap, bap. Boom.
BOTH: Whoo!
Yeah.
Hey. Whoo!
Sha... Bah!
Dude, how was Indonesia?
Oh, man, the swells were nectar.
Primo pearls, my
The waves were all like, "Muuma."
And I was like, "Bra!"
I was a one-man stoke machine
all summer long.
- Oh, mondo, dude.
- Beyond mondo, bro. Beyond mondo.
How was your summer? You spend
some quality time carving up the tubes?
I met a girl.
- No way. You trapped a honey?
- Yeah.
- Is she a super-chill surf chick?
- Yeah, well, yeah, she surfs.
- So, she's one of us? Laid back?
- Yeah, she's laid back.
On occasion. When she sleeps.
Probably.
Excellent.
I can't wait to meet
your little beach bunny.
Yeah, I mean, just...
I wouldn't call her that, exactly.
Right on, bro. Right on.
Three-pointer!
Oh, oh.
- Let's go.
-
MACK:
Big Save the Beach Dance
this weekend.
Buy a ticket, save a seal.
Oh, come on. Who doesn't love seals?
Well, sharks, but they don't like anyone.
- Mack!
-
- Hey, how was your summer?
- Oh, beyond.
Science camp was epic,
the college tour was fab,
and don't even get me started on
the student government conference.
I'm so glad you came back this year.
I don't know what I would've done
if I'd lost you to that prep school.
Yeah, I'm glad I'm back, too.
- Oh, here.
- Ooh. What's this?
Uh, well, I made a deal with myself.
If I'm staying here, I'm doing
things that are important to me.
So, I started an oceanography club.
Which is super-convenient since
our school is literally on the ocean.
Super cool. Sign me up.
Oh! I have news.
Guess who I hung out with
at the student government conference?
Spencer Watkins.
The literally cutest guy in school.
BRADY: Mack.
- Brady. Hi.
- Hey.
Oh, you're wearing flip-flops to school.
Yeah, totally. They're my fancy ones.
-
- Oh.
This is my bro, Devon.
Devon, this is my girlfriend, Mack.
- This is your girlfriend?
- This is your boyfriend?
- You seem surprised.
- Oh, no, bro. It's cool.
Book-bag. It looks very full of books.
And he doesn't seem
to have a bag, at all.
I do not have a bag.
I do, however, have a pen.
-
- How long has that been in there?
-  Want some?
- Why not?
So, I'll see you later?
- Yeah, during break?
- Can't. French study group.
- Uh, lunch?
- Calculus study group.
After school?
Oceanography club
dance subcommittee meeting.
- How's Easter looking for you?
-
-
- Oh, um...
We have marine biology
together, right? Third period?
- So, I'll see you then.
- Sure, yeah. Cool.
- Okay.
- All right.
Mack seems super cool, bro.
Yeah, yeah. She is.
I mean, she went right to class
when the bell rang.
Different.
But, to each their own.
Mmm.
What's up,
my pucker-faced little buddy?
Sorry.
Sorry.
No.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- What you working on?
-  Nothing.
Okay.
- This is fantastic.
-
Mack! I got all the good stuff. Score!
I'm gonna go fire up the centrifuge. Oh.
Spencer.
Wow. Hi.
You look great.
Really, really great. Super great.
Perfect, even.
- Uh, thanks, Alyssa, I appreciate it.
-
So, Mack, uh,
I'm happy that you're in this class.
I heard that you started
an oceanography club.
I'm chairing
the environmental studies society.
Really? I wanted to talk to you guys.
I thought we could work together
on shoreline watershed issues.
Yes. And maybe an emphasis on
habitat restoration and marine pollution.
Oh, I love pollution.
I mean, I don't love pollution.
- But it's an important issue.
- Yeah.
Uh, I'm also the head of a club.
It's the, uh, surf club.
You just hang out and surf.
Spencer, this is Brady.
Brady, it's... I've seen you surf.
You're amazing, man.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
- Uh...
- Um...
Right, yeah.
- Centrifuge.
- Check.
- Methylene blue dye.
- Check.
- Cultured Petri dish.
- Check.
Begin inoculation.
Let's dilute those solvents. Whoo!
Whoa. Cool.
Here we've got some weird,
tube-y thing.
A squeezy-sponge. Some wet stuff.
And a blue, creepy glove.
- Oh, you think?
- Yeah.
Thanks. I've always loved biology,
and the ocean.
Hey, uh, have you checked out
the new oceanography program
at Oregon Coastal College?
You get to spend half a year
on a ship at sea.
-
- I could introduce you to the rep.
That'd be amazing.
Brady.
You okay, my man?
Yeah, yeah, I'm good. Totally.
All right, well, let's do this.
What?
I made a volcano!
- Uh, uh...
- That's so sick.
Oh, gnarly. Dude, look at this. What?
Oh, my gosh.
Mack! Mack!
- Hey.
- MACK: Hey.
Oh, hey, before I forget.
What do you think of this?
I'm gonna sell them
at the Save the Beach Dance.
- I dig it.
- Good, 'cause I got you, like, eight.
-
- Wow.
I'm gonna need a bigger wrist. Thanks.
Hey, there's a big swell on.
Wanna go surfing?
Uh, that sounds awesome, but I can't.
The dance is this weekend,
and we are totally behind schedule.
Oh, speaking of, I had the coolest idea.
What if the dance was
a '60s  theme party?
You could do it at the beach.
People could dress up in costumes.
You could even project the movie
on a big 1960s-type theater deal.
- That would be really cool.
- Right?
But there's just no time.
And, as much as I love
you and I are, like, the only people
under 50 that have ever heard of it.
Yeah, you're probably right.
Oh, the college fair, later.
You're going with me, right?
Right. Yeah. Uh-huh.
Brady, this is important. It's college.
It's our future.
And there's
this amazing oceanography program
that I have to check out.
Yes, of course. I'll be there.
- In actual shoes?
- Sure.
- Okay.
- Yeah. See you.
Bye.
Guess I'll go surf by myself.
- Brady.
- Hey, bro.
Whoa.
Okay. Universal online
college application.
Hmm. "What personal attributes
uniquely qualify you
"as an extraordinary applicant?"
Are you kidding me?
Let's see. Deeper bottom curve,
better on steep waves.
How do you increase water
displacement, so it rides smoother?
- Hey, Mom.
- How's that going?
It's going. Slowly. Very slowly.
Mmm.
Wow. How's that going?
It's going. I mean, I've opened it up.
I've stared at it.
Mmm.
Well, don't stress yourself
out too much.
Yeah.
It's just, everyone seems so focused.
They've got their whole lives
mapped out. Like Mack.
She knows where she wants to go,
what she wants to do.
And I... And I don't even know
what I want for dinner.
Things were a little rough
with you two back at school, today?
No.
Okay, maybe.
Yeah.
Have you seen my brown marker?
I can't find it.
Oh!
I'm sure things are gonna work out
between you two.
Okay?
- And bring these wet towels downstairs.
- Sure, Mom.
Dinner's back at the house at 6:00.
BUTCHY: So, Tanner,
is you's and me's ready
to disarm
the diabolical weather machine now?
You bet, daddio.
Ready is my middle name.
It is Lewis, but it's also Ready.
'Cause that's what I was born.
- Ready.
- Ready! From the moment he was born.
Don't go, Tanner. It's so dangerous.
Don't worry.
- Danger is also my middle name.
- Mmm-hmm.
I think. Along with Ready and Lewis.
That is a very long name.
Okay, Tanner.
I'll just wait right here for you, and...
Well, actually, why don't I come, too?
Oh.
Uh...
What?
- Why don't I come with you?
-
I mean,
all that happens when you guys go off
is we stand here and do nothing.
Maybe I can help.
GIRL: What?
Uh, just one... Excuse us.
Um...
But girls aren't supposed to.
Right. I'm sorry.
I don't know where that came from.
Forget about it.
-
-
Okay.
Go, Tanner. Be safe.
Be brave.
You're my hero.
Let's go!
GIRL 1: Come back soon!
GIRL 2: So brave.
-
-
- No!
-
No, no.
Yes!
No!
Thanks, Grandma.
Grandma?
Yes.
What? Oh.
Yes. Whoo!
- Thank you so much for talking to me.
- A pleasure.
It was great meeting you, Mack.
I hope you'll apply.
- Nice meeting you, too.
- You, too.
You're right. This program is awesome.
- I knew you'd love it.
- BRADY: Mack.
What's going on?
Brady, it's already over.
Where were you?
Listen, uh, I better be going.
In case you need it.
I will see you guys tomorrow.
BRADY: You know,
you could've at least shot me a text.
- I did.
- No, you didn't.
- Twelve. Yeah, check your phone.
- What?
Is it too much for you
to take one thing seriously?
- At least, I take us seriously.
- What?
I take us seriously.
You were 45 minutes late.
What were you doing?
Did you just forget?
I was... It was nothing.
- Nothing?
- Something.
I don't wanna talk about it.
Well, you won't even tell me
why you stood me up?
Brady, we used to
tell each other everything.
- What is happening with us?
- Well, you tell me.
It's almost like the school-you
wants nothing to do with me.
This coming from the school-you that
keeps secrets and flakes out on me.
Well, maybe
we just don't work at school.
- Maybe we don't.
- Awesome.
Awesome.
So, I'll see you next summer, which,
apparently, is the next time you're free.
- Fine by me.
- Great.
That's just awesome.
BRADY:
'Cause all these plans we made
in the sand are through
And if it's only me myself and I
Will I be fine?
And I just don't know
Am I gonna make it?
Brave enough to take this road
out on my own?
But no matter what
I'm walking right off this stage
And never looking back
Looking back to yesterday
As long as I got me myself and I
I'm doing fine
Brave enough to take this road
out on my own
LELA:
Nice of you to drop in.
I guess I literally fell for you, huh?
Falling for you
Falling for you
I'm Lela.
I'm sorry, I can't do this. Put me down.
LELA: Oh!
CHEECHEE: Whoa!
Uh, Lela.
- What are you doing?
- I don't know.
This whole thing, I can't do it anymore.
It's not you, Tanner.
You're a great guy, but...
Of course, I am.
I have to go.
Where is she going?
Okay.
Excuse me, guys.
Excuse me. Sorry.
Lela.
What's going on?
What are we doing?
It's very windy and not good for my hair.
Ever since Mack and Brady came,
I have felt different.
Mack wasn't like any girl I ever knew.
She inspired me. I...
- I miss her.
- I miss her, too.
And Brady. They were swell.
But, uh, they're not here anymore.
- I want to be like her, Tanner.
- What?
Try new things.
Experience new experiences.
What is that?
Tanner, look.
Do you know what this is?
Uh...
A necklace.
I gave it to Mack.
And it came back to me here, now.
Don't you see? It's a sign.
It really looks like a necklace.
This means
she's out there, somewhere.
I need to be where she is.
Goodbye, Tanner.
What?
Oh.
Goodbye, Bikers.
Good bye, Surfers.
Goodbye, people always
standing around in the background,
who never speak,
whose names I don't know.
-
-
-
-
We gotta stop her, right?
Yeah, I mean, we definitely could.
But water makes me a little bit nervous.
- What?
- I know.
Maybe we should sing a song.
That usually fixes everything.
No, no.
Uh, maybe I'll talk in my low voice.
Lela, come back.
Yeah, maybe I'd save the low voice
for someone who can actually hear you.
She's already in the ocean.
Oh, where's they goin's?
Lela!
LELA: Jeepers.
TANNER: Oh, my.
Tanner. What are you doing here?
I don't know.
Hey, are you okay? I'm okay.
It's a little hot outside.
I don't know what to do.
- Where are we?
- Tanner.
Why is it so hot outside?
- Tanner.
- What?
Oh, my.
LELA: Oh!
Well, jeepers.
LELA: Oh!
MAN 1: Let's get our boards.
MAN 2: All right!
Those fellas are made of rubber!
Oh, golly.
Jeepers.
Is that Big Momma's?
Huh? No, it's, uh,
Billy's Beach Burgers and...
Sha...
Shushi.
- What's a shushi? Where are we?
- I don't know. We... Oh!
- Excuse me.
- Hey.
What's happening?
Oh, so much.
So, we went into the water
and then came out of the water,
and now it's daytime,
and we saw rubber people,
and boat cycles, and it's...
I think we're lost.
Here. Use my phone.
FEMALE AUTOMATED VOICE:
The little box just spoke to us.
-
-
Wow! How'd I get in there?
Hi, small me. Looking good.
Tanner, are we here?
Did we make it?
Are we in Mack's world?
- We come to your world in peace.
-
FEMALE AUTOMATED VOICE:
Hello, lady in the little box.
FEMALE AUTOMATED VOICE:
- 'Sup, bro?
- Hey, Brady.
I thought we weren't supposed
to see each other until next summer.
I'm just going surfing.
- I'm just cleaning the beach.
- Of course.
You're cleaning the beach
in my favorite surf spot.
Your surf spot happens to be
where there's a lot of trash.
What's that supposed to mean?
It means that there's a lot of actual
trash here, and I'm cleaning it up.
Mack, what?
Brady, would you think I was crazy
if I told you that two people
that look exactly like Lela and Tanner
are walking towards us on this beach?
Hey!
Lela! Tanner!
Lela, Tanner!
Tanner!
Lela!
Mack, Mack, Mack!
Can we take a second and
realize that they are actually here?
Wait, yes. Okay.
Wow. You are here. With us.
Why? How?
I found the necklace.
I lost the necklace in the ocean.
And it floated back to me.
I knew it was a sign.
I had to find you.
So, I carried the necklace
out into the water,
questioning my whole existence.
And I didn't question anything.
LELA: And the next thing we knew,
well, here we are.
Oh, uh, I have one quick question.
Um...
Where, exactly, is here?
- Oh, we're on the beach, silly.
- Oh, right.
But, like, what country are we in?
Uh...
- Let's just say we're in the future.
- TANNER: The future?
Like, it's already tomorrow, today?
A few days past tomorrow.
Cool.
Cool?
Tanner, that is way cooler than cool.
It's...
Hold on.
Take a look around
at this amazing place
I don't know if it's Earth
or if it's outer space
Wherever we are
It's clear to me
Take a look around
at this amazing world
Where you can do it all
even if you're a girl
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
I think I'm gonna love it here
because it seems
Like the kind of place
where I can follow my dreams
-
-
FEMALE AUTOMATED VOICE:
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
The more I see
the more I just can't get enough
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
BRADY: Hey, wait up.
And I don't think I ever wanna leave.
Come on, Tanner.
Let's take a walk down
this crazy beach of tomorrow.
Yeah.
It's pretty great that they're here.
You know, it's a little weird,
and kind of impossible,
but I did miss them.
Brady, what are we gonna do
with them?
I mean, they're from 1962.
They could get in some serious trouble.
- Come on. Lela and Tanner?
- Yeah.
What could they possibly...
- TANNER: On.
-
Off!
On.
Off again!
On again.
Yeah. What are we gonna do with them?
TANNER: Off again.
TANNER: On again! Off again!
Brady, is it just me,
or is their hair totally dry?
Yes, it's completely dry,
just like when they surf in the movie.
TANNER: On again! Off again!
On again!
Remember what happened to us
when we got stuck in their world?
We almost zapped out of existence.
- We've gotta get them home.
- I know.
We should just
tell them the truth.
You know, they're made up characters
in a 1962 beach movie.
What... That's gonna blow their minds.
Oh, you're right.
- They can't handle that.
- No.
Well, then maybe
we just show them that our world
isn't as great as they think it is,
so, they want to go back.
Yeah, then they'll take
the necklace in the ocean,
- and, boom, they're home.
- Exactly.
- Hey, where does the record go?
-
No, I know this technology stuff
can be really complicated.
So, if you're gonna come
to school with me,
we should probably make you
look a little less like you.
You're about my size.
I get to wear your clothes?
Well, sure.
Yeah, there's a ton of stuff
in my wardrobe.
Just pick something not too flashy.
Ooh! Goody.
Hmm.
Mmm.
Is this out of sight on me, or what?
- Yeah. Totally out of sight.
-
- Oh, I love this song.
-
Uh...
Okay. Well, that's impossible.
You look good. Try this.
Ooh.
Pink.
I love it.
- We're back in the '60s.
- Ooh.
Uh...
Whoa.
So, you ready for school?
Great.
Just make sure
no one knows where you're from.
BUTCHY: All right,
bring it in, everybody.
We needs to talk,
'cause I'm feeling
a little lost here, peoples.
Ever since Tanner and Lela
just walked off into the ocean,
I got this sense that
things are supposed to be happening.
It just ain't happening.
We could rumble.
That usually cheers you up.
You know what,
I does love a good rumble.
But, no, that's not what's supposed
to be happening, right now. I...
You know what? Maybe somebody
should sing something.
Maybe like Lela would've done
if she was here.
I thought you'd never...
-
- Cheechee.
Mmm?
Sing something.
But I'm doing my nails.
Oh.
-
- Oh!
All right, I'll sing.
Five, six, seven, eight!
What?
I'm not the kind
To fall for a guy
Don't usually swoon
But I'm over the moon
-
-
-
-
I know I shouldn't
But I, I just can't stop myself
-
-
-
-
- Whoa!
-
I'm not the kind
To fall for a guy
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
BUTCHY: What was that?
What's the matters with yous?
I thought you was gonna catch her.
I thought the exact same thing,
just not in time.
You're lucky my hair didn't broke.
Yous is right, Butchy.
This don't feel right. None of it.
Not one thing.
Does it help if I do this?
You know what,
that actually does kind of help.
- That's pretty decent. Yeah.
-
BOY 1: Yeah, that's pretty nice.
BOY 2: It's crazy.
BOY 1: You're really good at this.
Okay, guys. Welcome to school.
So, a few ground rules.
Okay, don't do anything
that gives you guys away.
- No hair-wetting.
- No clothes-changing.
Oh, that thing that you do
with your teeth.
This thing?
Yeah. Don't do that.
- Yeah, and especially, no singing.
- No singing.
But look at this place.
There's so much to see.
So much to do.
-
-
- No, no, no, no.
- Stop.
No singing.
- Just one song?
- No.
- One verse?
- No.
- One word?
- No.
Not even if it's from the heart
and moves the story along?
No.
- MACK: Don't...
- Here, go get Lela.
- Don't...
- Oh!
Okay, man, stay close to me,
act natural,
and just walk down the hallway,
and be cool, okay?
Oh, you got it.
There's one thing
I do better than anyone,
and that's walk down a school hallway.
Awesome. Wait... What?
You put the rock in my roll
with the way you smile
Keep me up on my toes
Got me running wild
You got my head going round
like a circle spinning
Hi.
You make me mad
then you give me grinning
What have you heard?
The rumors are true
That I-I-I-I...
I wanna be with you
-
-
People dig me.
Brady! Greetings, meister-bro.
- Man, what's up?
- Chillin'.
Who's this dude?
This is my cousin Dolf, from Iceland.
Iceland. Righteous.
I love that little volcanic archipelago.
I went a couple years ago to surf
and it was cold.
Do you know my boy Ólafur Einarsson?
Or Jónsdóttir Gunnarsdotter?
Your hair is very pointy.
Thanks, dude.
It's amazing what you can do
with a screwdriver and some surf wax.
I use my own secret mix
of coconut juice and rubber cement.
- Rubber cement?
-  Yeah.
Wicked! I love this dude! All right.
See you guys.
-
-
This place is so neat!
-
-
So, what'd you think of calculus?
Pretty brutal, right?
I mean,
that's what life's like in the real world.
- Tough classes...
- I loved it. It's magical.
The integral accurately
gives the area under a formula
while the derivative predicts
the instantaneous slope at any point.
It's fantastic.
Wow, you really got it, huh?
Oh, who knew
learning could be so much fun?
- Mack, hey.
- Hey.
Who's... Who's this?
This is, uh, my cousin, Delga,
from Finland.
You are so cute.
-
-
Hey, listen, uh,
I hope I didn't cause any problems
between you and Brady, yesterday.
Oh, no. No.
Our problems are totally our own.
Fair enough.
Hey, how's the Save the Beach Dance
shaping up?
MACK: It's okay. Uh...
We haven't really sold many tickets, so.
Just hoping people will show up.
Oh, I'm sure they will.
It's a great cause.
Great. Well, I'll catch you guys later.
Well, then
I hope you have a really big glove.
Oh, so you can catch us.
Okay.
There's going to be a dance?
This world just gets better and better.
Yeah, until your formerly
adorable boyfriend
starts acting like
a completely different person.
Trust me, Lela,
you're better off in your world,
where boys are simple and reliable.
ALYSSA: Mack!
Oh, hi.
Uh, hi.
Uh, this is, um...
Lela.
I'm here to discover who I am
and find fulfillment.
A woman that knows what she wants.
I like her.
I did my philosophy camp thesis
on female self-empowerment.
I can rebuild a motorcycle.
Really?
I'm looking into
buying a scooter.
I'd love your perspective
on engine torque differentials.
Oh, I can go on and on about torque.
ALYSSA:  Oh. Bye, Mack.
Ugh. It's a disaster.
She loves everything.
Even Mr. Terry's chemistry class.
She titrated her
sodium hydroxide perfectly,
and loved the way the
resulting solution matched her shoes.
Well, I think
I'm wearing down Tanner a little.
Nuggets made
out of chicken? Amazing!
- Or not.
-
Don't worry, I have a plan.
We turn them loose alone
in the most dangerous, confusing,
scary place imaginable.
A place where one false move
results in exile, shame, horror.
Wait. Where?
BRADY: The cafeteria.
Okay.
Hi, we're new here.
I could care less, spray-tan.
Uh, actually, it's Tanner.
No "Spray",
add an "Er". Tanner.
- Tanner Lewis Ready Danger.
- Uh...
- Oh, no, I...
- Ah...
Get out of my face.
Tanner, are you getting the impression
that people here are a little
stand-offish and, well, mean-ish?
Right? And angry-ish, too.
Like the Bikers and Surfers,
only angry-ish-er.
Why is everyone sitting apart?
Well, come on, everyone.
Where's your smile?
It's so easy anyone can do it.
- It's attached to you, here on your face.
-
There are 43 muscles to use.
Take it from me
Don't try to resist
Just go along
Don't fight the song
ALL:
I'm really sorry my face hurt your fist.
That's okay. Now, I know you exist.
Hey, haven't I seen you in class?
Yes, every day. This year and last.
It's pretty cool how you wail on the bass.
What's happening to my face?
There's only so much time
before the school bell rings
We will never speak of this ever again.
Bye!
Okay, what is going on here?
It's like we're bored, or something.
We's not bored, Butchy.
- We's confused.
- Yeah.
Spit it out.
CHEECHEE: Spit it out.
Spit it out.
Spit it out.
Look!
One of them Surfer guys,
who's always standing behind us,
and never says nothing.
- He just up and...
- Just sparkled up and vanished!
- Into thin airs!
- Like a magician.
Doing a magic trick on himself.
Dude, you got some bodacious pipes.
You totally have to be in my surf band.
I play a gnarlacious didgeridoo.
Thanks! Why are we talking so loudly?
Later, my
See you later? Okay!
Oh, Lela. Hi.
Um...
Wanna hang out?
I've been working on some new looks.
Check 'em out.
I call this one, "Thoughtful Handsome."
This one's, "Soulful Smolder."
Those are wonderful, Tanner.
But I can't.
We have calculus homework.
It's so exciting.
Oh.
Oh, okay. Uh, well, have fun.
Without me.
We're further than ever
from talking them into going back.
You watch Lela, I'll watch Tanner.
I learned all these new things,
and then I was sitting there,
and I'm like,
"Hey, why don't I make a new look?"
So, I made a new look, and it was,
"Renegade Rebel," you know?
And then... What was the other one?
I can't think of what it was.
Oh, yeah.
"Mysterious Wanderer."
And then, uh, "Thinking Guy."
Uh, here. Check this out.
Ooh.
Thanks.
Oh.
Hi, medium-sized me.
Still looking good.
Brady, can I talk to you for a second?
Yeah, sure.
Um...
I've been thinking about things.
And I don't normally like to think
about things.
You see, I always assumed
Lela would just be there for me.
But that night when she ran
into the water with her necklace,
it gave me
this strange feeling in my stomach.
It felt like...
Like when I drink a milkshake too fast.
It felt like...
Like things
might not work out.
It's called, "Worry."
Yeah, yeah. That.
And, the thing is,
things always work out for me.
But here, now, I still have that feeling.
- Worry?
-  Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm worried that Lela wanted to come
to this strange world
because I wasn't enough for her.
Yeah.
I mean...
I guess all you can really do is
be the best dude you can be
and hope that's enough.
Is that what you do with Mack?
Um...
Not recently, no.
We kind of hit a rough patch.
I've been working on something
I haven't told her about yet.
What is it?
Come on.
TANNER: Are these surfboards?
BRADY: Yeah.
They're all surfboards, but prototypes.
Like this one. It has rotating fins,
so you can surf in any direction.
Or this one. It's one of my favorites.
It's my surfboard suitcase.
So, you fold up your board,
put it in your bag,
and it goes up on the carry on,
then when you land,
you're ready to surf.
That is so cool!
Yeah.
- Wait. So, you made all this stuff?
- Uh-huh.
I've never made anything.
What's all this stuff?
This one's crazy.
So, you have two water intakes and
that leads to this sealed hydro-turbine
that also goes to an internal,
lithium-ion battery.
Then, we have a pneumatic actuator
that's connected to this hatch,
that makes it open whenever I want it to.
Uh...
Everything you just said,
I have no idea what it means.
Basically, this surfboard
doesn't need any waves.
Well, that is, if it works.
- That's so cool.
-
Why can't you tell Mack?
Uh...
Because, I don't think she'll get it.
You know, me spending
so much time on surfboards.
She's got her whole life mapped out.
- She wants to go to college.
- College?
What's it... Where is it...
What's a... Where's a college?
It's far away.
And it's full of impressive people,
like her. It's...
It's not a place where a guy like me
could get around by making surfboards.
I understand, Brady.
Maybe the problem is
that you're not tan enough.
Mack, I never knew I could be so happy.
I mean, I love it all,
the challenging classes,
the interesting conversations.
The flavored lip gloss.
I mean, really. Triple vanilla kiwi berry?
I never even knew
there was more than one vanilla.
- Can I...
- Yeah.
Lela, here's the thing.
Our world isn't really all that great.
Oh, there's finals and taxes
and global warming
and hangnails and public restrooms.
You really had it good
back in your world.
You don't have to worry
about your future
or picking the right college.
You have a boy that loves you.
You have a boy that loves you.
Right?
And you want more than that, right?
You want to live life to the fullest.
I want that, too.
But, Lela, being with the right person
can actually make life more full.
If you have the same passion,
the same drive.
Or, maybe that doesn't help at all.
You know, maybe
he just has to respect your passion
and not keep secrets from you
and get weird when you're busy.
I don't know.
It's all pretty confusing here,
which is why you should go home.
What? What's wrong?
You look normal.
-
- Oh.
Hello?
It's Mack.
- Oh.
-
Yeah.
What?
Hi, Mack.
Yeah, we'll be right over.
- Tanner, we gotta go. Come on!
- Huh?
Whoo!
Whoo!
Whoa!
Tanner!
Lela, you look like future Lela.
- Groovy.
- Super groovy.
No, not groovy at all, actually.
Very un-groovy.
She's not supposed to be able
to look modern.
Smile.
No shining teeth pang!
- What are you doing?
- It's okay. It's okay.
- What are you...
- Just go with it.
Stop it!
- Hey. What... What are you...
- Look. Wet!
What's happening?
What are... What is...
Why is my hair so squishy and limp?
I don't understand!
What is this feeling?
Brady, do you understand
what's happening?
The whole essence of who they are
is changing.
They could be stuck here forever.
Or, the whole fabric of our reality could
just rip open. We gotta get them back.
Well, maybe we should just tell them
where they're from, what they do?
But are we worried
what that might do to them?
Well, we're running
out of options, Mack.
Lela, Tanner.
You're just made up characters
from a movie. You are not real.
Huh?
Maybe I would've eased it
into them a little more gently.
But...
A movie? I don't understand.
- Here. Look at this.
-
-
-
Hey, it's us, doing things we usually do.
You guys are from an imaginary world.
A movie world. My favorite movie.
It's where Mack and I met.
But I don't want to live in a movie world.
But you do.
That's why
your life's always been so perfect, Lela.
It's where you belong.
How do we make them understand?
We could explain to them
in a language they know.
You mean...
Here we go.
Yep.
No, you guys, honestly,
life is better in a movie.
- Yes!
-
MAN 1:
MAN 2:
MAN 1:
MAN 2:
MAN 1:
MAN 2:
BOTH:
Action!
Rollback.
Perfect!
-
-
-
-
-
- Whoa.
-
-
-
-
Everybody dances
when the music starts to play
ALL: Hey!
- ALL: Hey!
-
- Tanner.
- Tanner.
-
-
-
-
GIRL: Can I have your autograph?
No!
I'm sorry, but no.
I don't want to be that girl anymore.
I don't want somebody
to write my lines for me.
I want to stay here.
Forever.
Um... Lela!
Well, that was dramatic,
and potentially terrible.
Hey, move it!
Out of the way, out of the way,
out of the way, out of the way.
Okays!
I think
there's only one thing for us to do.
ALL: Yeah?
And that's to not do anythings and
pretend that nothing bad is happening.
- Sound good? Perfect. Okay.
-
CHEECHEE: Butchy, Butchy!
Whoa!
Oh, my gosh.
You are not gonna believe this.
Oh, Cheechee, what's wrong?
We was walking with our pals,
Sidecar and Muffler, and, boom!
They just up and vanished.
Oh, this is terribles.
Peoples have been disappearing
left and right!
-
- Any one of us could be next!
Oh.
Okay, things started going wrong
ever since Tanner and Lela took off
into the ocean.
You thinks thems leaving is somehow
corenated with this chain of events?
- Yeahs, I do. Hey, what's that?
-
This is the same necklace my sister had
when she disappeared into the ocean.
Maybe we's can use it, too.
We can find Tanner and Lela.
We'll bring 'em back, and then
maybe everything will be normal again.
We're leaving?
I gotta go home
and get some hairspray.
This does not travel well.
- No, we ain't got time, Cheech.
- Whoa!
We gotta get there right now,
before more of us start disappearing.
But wait.
Where, exactly, is there?
How am I supposed to know, Struts?
I ain't been there yet.
Come on.
Oh, yeah.
Water gives you the fears, don't it?
Yeah, it does.
But some things is bigger than fears.
Now, let's go!
Right.
It's gone, Mack.
No, it might still wash up.
Last time, I ended up
in a parallel movie universe.
MACK: Do you have any better ideas?
Just keep looking.
Don't take this out on me.
I wasn't the one who just blurted it out.
Like, "Hey, Lela, guess what?
You're not real."
Really? So, this is my fault?
- How else should I have said it?
- I don't know!
You could've been a little less direct.
Less direct, like,
kept it a secret from her?
Kept her in the dark?
Yeah, 'cause that's been working
so well for you, lately.
Well, maybe
we should go ask Spencer for help.
Really? We're back to that.
How about this?
You just keep looking over there.
- I'm gonna look over here.
- Yeah, fine by me.
What was that about?
I think they were arguing.
But they're not in rival gangs.
Here, I guess, couples do it, too.
I don't like it.
Me, neither.
Well, that's odd.
What?
Why are those crazy cats
wearing their clothes in the water?
Lela, those aren't cats.
- This is great! Whoa!
- Yeah.
Those are...
- Guys.
-
- Tanner!
- Lela!
- Our friends!
- Our friends! Oh!
Whoa.
Those people are made out of rubber.
Are you kidding me?
Hi! Hi! Come over here.
Butchy! Lugnut!
Cheechee! Struts!
Rascal! Seacat! Giggles!
Oh, we's did it! We's found you's guys.
Hey, guys. Wow. You're all here.
What are you doing here?
What do you mean
what are we doing here?
We came to take
Tanner and Lela home.
- TANNER: What?
- No.
BUTCHY: No?
I don't want to go home, Butchy.
But, Lela, I'm your brother.
Don't you miss me?
- Don't you miss all of us?
- ALL: Yeah.
Yes. Of course.
A lot, but...
Well, I'm starting
to find myself here, Butchy.
I'm happy.
Okay, look, Lela,
that's all wells and goods,
but you see, the thing is, back home,
things are starting to disappear, like...
Wait, what's disappearing?
Peoples.
- Peoples?
- Yeah, peoples.
Peoples are just starting to sparkle up,
and poof, and they vanish.
And we don't even know where's to.
Or if they's coming back.
That's it. That's what's happening.
Lela and Tanner are the stars
of the movie.
- Without the stars...
- There's no movie.
It's vanishing from existence.
You guys have to go back. Right away.
You have to go back into the movie,
otherwise, you're all
just gonna disappear.
What have I done?
Lela.
Lela, it's not your fault.
Okay, there's no way you could've
known this was gonna happen.
I've gotta go back.
It's our job to be characters in a movie.
Yeah, what are you's talking about?
What is she talking about?
It's complicated.
I'm gonna miss you, Mack.
Yeah, me, too.
You know, and somehow,
we will always be friends.
Even if we're in different worlds.
I know.
I just wish I didn't have to leave.
-  Bye, Brady.
- It's great seeing you.
Yeah.
Take care of yourself, all right?
Go get yourself home.
He's right.
We gotta get ourselves home.
Okay.
Bye.
Bye.
They're gone.
Um...
- Listen...
- Hey, um...
Well, I, uh, should get to the dance
to set up.
Yeah, yeah.
I guess I'll... I guess I'll see you there.
Yeah, I guess.
ANNOUNCER: All right, everybody.
The band's taking a break.
Here's a little something
to slow it down.
Hey, do you wanna, um...
Um...
I'd love to dance.
What's up, dude?
You know, school dances
aren't usually my scene,
but this fruit punch
is actually pretty nectar.
You all right, dude?
Yeah, I'm good.
I'm guessing things
aren't totally
with the little beach bunny?
Yeah. Things are a little not
I'm wondering how I can make things
not not  you know?
Beats me, bro.
But I'm pretty sure it doesn't involve
standing in a corner
and bumming oneself out.
- You good, man? All right.
- Yeah.
You.
Tanner, what are you doing, here?
Are you crazy?
The movie's vanishing.
You're all in danger.
We're here for you, Brady.
For me?
You and Mack. It was Tanner's idea.
Look, the way I see it is,
it's not right
that things aren't right with you two.
So, we came to help make things right.
Help you make things right.
- Right?
- Right.
Isn't it amazing to hear him like this?
I mean, he's caring about somebody
other than himself.
Oh, it's fantastic.
Brady, do you remember
when we were doing
that worry thing about Lela and Mack?
Well...
We forgot something important.
Something really important.
See, we have a word in our world, too.
It's called, "Confidence."
And it's spelled K-O-N...
... Fidence.
Actually, no, you need to remember it.
Because you're a good surfer and
a great friend and you make cool things.
What I'm trying to say is
you're an amazing guy.
And the only person keeping you
from realizing it is you.
You came back for us?
You risked everything.
Some things are worth the risk.
You know what, Tanner?
You're exactly right.
I can do this.
Yeah.
Hey, man, can I play a song real fast?
- Mmm-hmm.
- Dope. Thanks, man.
Hey, bro, okay, I need something
really upbeat, like, kick, snare.
- Yeah!
- Crazy. Cool?
Mmm-hmm.
Like a brand-new board
and the awesomest wave
Forever chillin'
and trying to catch some waves
Instead of rock, rock, rock
rock, rock 'n' roll
And you're down with who I am
since I broke the mold
Come on and feel this beat
'cause I gotta be me
Yeah, let it move those feet
It'll set you free
Come on, ya need to see
that I gotta be me
Come on and feel this beat
'cause I gotta be me
Yeah, let it move those feet
It'll set you free
Come on, you need to see
that I gotta be me
Trying to move this world
from where it's at
Yet whenever we're together
we're more than that
Not if you're fast enough
for a girl on the go
Come on and feel this beat
'cause I gotta be me
Yeah, let it move those feet
It'll set you free
Come on, you need to see

ALL: Whoo!
Hey!
Oh!
ALL: Hey!
Oh!
Hey!
- I guess I literally fell for you, huh?
-
Okays, I hate to ruin
this beautiful moment,
but we gotta get back
to whatever's on the other side
of that terrifying, watery stuff.
- He means the ocean.
- Yeah, what she said.
No, guys, he's right.
We gotta get out of here
before another one of us...
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no.
-
-
Vanishes!
- LELA: Butchy!
- He's gone.
- With the necklace.
- Guys, there's nothing here but nothing.
This is happening.
How do we make this all right?
How do we get back
before we all vanish?
Wait, when you guys
first came to our world,
you didn't have the necklace,
'cause I hadn't given it to you yet.
How did you get there then?
You ready?
Let's do it.
CHEECHEE: There they is.
STRUTS: We gotta do something
before we all start to disappear.
CHEECHEE: Just like Butchy.
- We don't have a lot of time.
- This surfboard will take you home.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I sure hope so. Here.
All right, go paddle out
and catch a really big wave.
- Oh, no.
- There's no surf.
- How can you surf if there's no surf?
- Well, you can't.
- CHEECHEE: Uh, oh, no.
- No. No.
Whoa!
Oh, no.
Uh-oh.
Good luck, guys.
Tanner, we're the only ones left.
We have to go. Now.
Otherwise, we're gonna disappear,
and the movie will be gone forever.
But how? You need waves to surf.
Tanner, remember when you told me
you've never made anything?
- Yeah.
- I need you to help me make something.
Okay. Here.
Take these pliers, right here,
and you're gonna put it
under the emblem,
and you're gonna pry it off, okay?
Awesome. Come on, Mack.
We gotta go.
- Where?
- To my house.
Under there, and then I'll pull up, okay?
Okay. Good.
- Brady.
- Yeah?
Brady, I thought
we were going to your house.
Just come on.
Um...
Um, glue. Where's the glue?
Where's the glue?
Brady, what is this place?
It's my workshop/chill out space.
And all of those?
Surfboards.
- And you made them?
- Uh-huh. It's not as hard as it looks.
Actually, it's pretty hard.
Yes! Okay.
This was your secret.
Yeah.
I've been making surfboards.
But not just any surfboards.
Boards that do what other boards don't.
And why couldn't you tell me that?
Because, Mack, you're so together.
College, your oceanography club.
You've got a vision for your life
and your future.
And I just thought that, I don't know,
you wouldn't respect it.
Brady, this is incredible.
My grandfather has made boards
his whole life.
It's an art.
And what you're doing here,
this is a vision for your life.
- You really think so?
- Yeah, I do.
Good,
'cause I've been building
this one for us.
Remember in the summer
when we couldn't surf
'cause there were no waves?
I had this idea that,
what if you could surf with no waves?
This surfboard
has a motor built inside it.
- So, you can surf when there's no surf.
- Exactly.
No matter what. Anytime.
Brady, it's beautiful.
If this baby works,
we might have a shot
at getting Tanner and Lela home.
- Let's do it.
- Brady.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry you felt like
you had to hide this from me.
You know what really matters
about our future?
No secrets.
Done.
- Let's go.
- Okay.
-  Look at that. We did it!
- BRADY: Guys, guys!
- TANNER: We got the emblem off it.
- Hey, yeah.
Hey, this is the hydro-lithium, uh, board.
The one that can surf by itself.
- The board that can surf by itself!
- Exactly.
Here, I've got this tire glue
that should do the trick.
Okay.
- Okay, help me, Tanner.
- All right.
We gotta get this board in the water.
Come on. Let's go.
- Lela, will you grab that end?
- Yeah, yeah.
- You got it?
- Yeah.
You okay?
Brady, do you know where we are?
Yeah.
We're at Dolphin's Cove.
Where we met.
Brady, if this doesn't work,
and Lela and Tanner vanish,
and the whole movie
never even existed,
then doesn't that mean
that we never even met?
I mean, if they don't make it,
then we won't even know each other.
Hey, hey, hey.
It's okay.
How could I ever forget you?
And you're the boy
who makes me smile
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-

-

ALL:  When it's meant to be
the stars seem to glisten
When it's meant to be
that's destiny calling
I guess this really is goodbye this time.
Thanks for everything, man.
Honestly, thanks for coming.
We needed it.
You're welcome, Brady.
Hey, I'm really glad
I got to see you again, Lela.
I am, too.
I'll never forget you.
Again.
Me, neither.
Lela, listen to me.
When you get back to your world,
it doesn't have to be the way it was.
Okay, you can start a math club.
Or create a new type of lip gloss.
You can do whatever you want.
Change the movie. Make it your story.
- Think I can change the movie?
- You can do it.
Thank you.
I will.
Here.
I'll treasure it forever.
Lela, we have to go.
Be right back.
BRADY: Okay, guys, stand up.
Make sure you bend your knees
when you ride this thing,
or else you're gonna fall right off.
Tanner, you hold the T-bar.
Lela, you hold on to Tanner's waist
super, super tight.
- Or else you're gonna fall.
- Okay.
- You guys good?
- Yeah.
- Good luck.
- Bye, Brady.
Bye, guys.
Bye, Brady.
- Brady, what's wrong?
- What is it?
I don't know.
Come on.
- What?
- The hatch won't open.
LELA: Brady, we've gotta go, now.
No. No, no, no, no, no.
Brady, it's happening. Oh, no!
I can't get it. I need my tool kit.
I need a small, Phillips screwdriver.
I can't get in there with my fingers.
I need some help.
Okay, Brady, Brady. Try this.
- Please hurry.
- TANNER: We've gotta go!
Please work.
- You ready? Go.
- Okay.
Come on, baby.
MACK:
and the whole movie
never even existed,
then doesn't that mean
that we never even met?
I mean, if they don't make it,
then we won't even know each other.
Yo, bro-heim.
Was I right, or was I right, dude?
I told you. Night body-surfing,
mondo spiritual, right?
I don't know, man. It was super flat.
And freezing.
I didn't catch a single thing.
Except, maybe, a cold.
- My bad, dude.
- It's all good.
- Hey, you ready to roll?
- Yeah, let's do this.
- Cool, man.
- Night bod-surfing is still cool, though.
Yeah, yeah.
- Hey, what's going on, here?
-
DEVON: Oh, it's that
Save The Beach dance.
There were flyers at school.
- They're gonna project a movie?
-
That looks super awesome.
You wanna crash it?
When have you known me
to pass up on a possible fiesta?
- Never.
-  Let's do this.
SPENCER: Thanks, guys.
They should each be in batches of 10.
And there should be
at least 100 altogether.
Some of them went rogue,
so you're gonna have to re-tie them
with the yellow string.
- Not another colored string...
- Can we help you guys?
- MAN: Yeah, two tickets, please.
- Oh.
- Thanks.
- Make good choices.
- MAN: Here we go.
- Mack, where have you been?
I just needed some air.
Oh, sales are through the roof.
You're a genius. People love the theme.
GIRL: Two tickets, please.
SPENCER: Here you go.
Hey, hey, hey.
Party for one for the big shindig tonight.
MAN: Hey, Devon! What's up?
Can I help you?
Yeah, I gotta ask, what's with
the big screen and the outfits?
Oh, it's a fund-raiser.
Yeah, we're saving the beach.
- It's a 1962 beach movie party.
- Cool.
What movie you gonna play?
Uh...
Nice.
You've never heard of it?
No, I've heard of it.
Everyone's heard of it.
So, then we agree that
it's the awesomest movie ever made.
- I'm not sure awesomest is a real word.
-
And even if it was, I'm not sure
that movie's exactly my jam.
That movie was totally ahead of its time.
It's the reason I love to surf.
You surf?
- Of course.
- Cool.
Okay, how about this?
You take a ticket, save the beach,
and if you don't totally dig it,
I'll buy you a mango smoothie.
I do love mangoes.
Then you're gonna win either way.
Thanks.
Oh.
Hi. Have fun.
Yo, speaking of mangoes,
I'm gonna go talk to Morgan.
- See you, dude.
- See you.
DEVON: Morgan.
ALYSSA: Okay, Mack,
you are gonna do so good.
- This is so exciting.
- Uh-huh.
And it's not as scary as you think.
It's only a little bit more scary
than you think.
- Just be calm, and...
- Alyssa, Alyssa.
- Okay.
- Just have fun, okay?
Thank you.
- Oh, hey. Here.
- Thank you.
- SPENCER: Alyssa, come on.
- Oh.
Hi. Thank you guys
so much for coming.
And now, the moment
we have all been waiting for,
Lela, Queen of the Beach.
-
-
Alyssa.
CHORUS:
And there's a fresh breeze
headed down the beach
A new beginning on
a wave of endless possibilities
I feel a good change
coming around the bend
It's a different story
'cause I changed the end
Everything is new when
I take your hand and I dance with you
Really?
Come on.
Sometimes you just gotta
spontaneously break into song. Right?
Gonna party down
till the sun comes up
Everything is new when
I take your hand and I dance with you
-
-
ALL: Pow!
BUTCHY:
ALL: Oh, Tanner.
-
- ALL: Oh.
ALL:
I'm Mack.
I'm Brady.
MACK:
ALL: Yeah!
-
-
-
-
What I had before is out the door
and it just won't do
Sometimes you gotta take a chance
Take a risk
Find out everything out there
that you missed
-
-
Yeah, I gotta hit reset
Begin again
Ain't never going back
to where I've been
Yeah, I'm gonna reboot, retool
Check my flow
Keep moving along
Trying to get where I want to go
Yeah, I've gotta hit reset
Begin again
Ain't never going back
to where I've been
Yeah, I'm gonna reboot, retool
Check my flow
Keep moving along
Trying to get where I want to go
'Cause I've been there, done that
Ain't looking over my shoulder
