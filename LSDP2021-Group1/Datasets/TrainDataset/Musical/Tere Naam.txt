"Remember, Kanak Sharma is a
candidate backed by Radhe Bhaiyya!"
We must elect Radhe
Bhaiyya's candidate...
as the general secretary of
our union once again this year
Here are the benefits if
Radhe Bhaiyya's candidate wins
You can go watch a movie and your
attendance will still be recorded
You can carry notes to cheat
in the exams
No action will be taken
for winking at pretty girls
The famous dance party
from Delhi has already arrived...
all arrangements for the
celebration are in place
We're only waiting for
the results to be declared
I've spent so much
in this election
"If I lose this election,
I'll have to commit suicide"
"Hey, Hemant bhaiyya...
why will you commit suicide?"
It's Kanak Sharma who's going to die.
I'll murder the bastard
Are you out of your mind?
Why do you keep talking nonsense?
Alex has told me.
I'll bump off the bastard
"Tiwari, skip the blah-blah"
You aren't supposed to think aloud
Radhe!
Sweetheart...
sweetheart...
"my heart says, sweetheart..."
come and meet me...
don't ever go far away from me
"No, no, no..."
I'm not falling in love...
don't steal my heart...
don't get closer to me
"Look, let me tell you..."
"in love, when you say no,
it means yes"
"Pretty girls' excuses are ages old,
no one has ever figured them out"
"They won't say a word,
their eyes do the talking..."
and they steal our hearts
You'd better admit it...
"those who fall in love,
shed tears"
"Some gain, some lose,
some smile, some cry..."
"some awake,
some sleep every moment"
"It stokes the fires,
it causes you to pine..."
it torments you so
"No, no, no..."
Sweetheart...
"my heart says, sweetheart..."
come and meet me...
don't ever go far away from me
"The first breeze of dawn,
awakens the world..."
the bees have started to hum...
the birds take to their wings...
"colourful decorations
mark every courtyard"
For blessings...
for fulfillment...
"at Your feet, Radha offers
flowers, O Krishna"
"You are the one
in my heart..."
O Krishna...
The colourful Krishna
"I'm crazed in love,
I have lost my senses..."
"You are the one
I am devoted to"
"At Your doorstep,
all day and night..."
"it's Your name
I always chant"
"Whatever I possess,
is Yours..."
"to You, I dedicate my life"
"at Your feet, Radha offers
flowers, O Krishna"
"You are the one
in my heart..."
O Krishna...
The sound of your daughter's
melodious voice every morning...
erases all our worries
"You finished your 12th. What have you
planned to do next, my child?"
She's going to attend college now.
- What will she gain in college?
She's going to be married after all
My son-in-law to-be has expressed
the wish that she studies further
"I see. Is that true, Rameshwar?"
"Yes, Uncle. All I could learn
at the tutelage was the Vedas"
At least she must be a graduate
So you want a wife
who speaks English!
"But you know how things are
at the college, don't you?"
Kids in Agra study less
and watch movies more
Nirjara is not like that.
And she has Indu for company
She'll take the 7:34 a.m.
Frontier Mail every morning
The college is near the station.
As soon as her classes are over...
she'll take the
Away from a world of hatred...
in a world of love...
"may you find happiness,
my friend..."
When an animals kill man...
"And now man has
slain an animal..."
why is the world quiet?
Give me that pickle
I'm told there was a furore yesterday.
You got into a fight at the college
"Fight? No, brother.
I broke their legs"
"If I had not got there on time,
Alex's men would have killed Kanak"
Why do you need to interfere
in someone else's affairs?
"He's a friend. Would I remain silent,
if someone came to beat you up?"
"Besides, it's my college"
It was! How many years is it
since you passed out of college?
But you still hang out there.
For no rhyme or reason
Will you spend the life of a vagabond
or find some work to do?
Enough. Let him have
the breakfast in peace
"Give me a puri, sister-in-law.
- Why one? Help yourself to 40"
Feed him the free food and make
a stronger bull out of him
So he can keep attacking everyone!
"Here's your puri, your bread...
and your milk"
Don't waste the food
Radhe...
- No
"Listen, Radhe...
- No, sister-in-law"
See that? You made him get up
while he was eating!
The skies haven't fallen.
You're the one who has spoilt him
He goes around with that
horrible hair of his...
and makes a few others
hang out with him too
I don't know what he's
going to do in life
Radhe's an old student
of the college
He rags the new students
with his friends
Don't look at them!
Just keep walking
"Look, Radhe.
There's a fresher with Indu"
Listen
Come here
Not you. Go to your class
and get on with your studies
First year?
B.A. Pass course
Can't you say good morning
to your seniors?
Not like that. Say it like
an attentive soldier
Keep saluting me like that
every time you pass by
All right.
- What's that?
And what's this?
- A peacock feather
I can see that. But why have you
kept it in a book?
"Kept in a notebook,
it doubles"
Must be laying eggs!
What's in the box?
Wow! Puri and a vegetable dish
Nice
"No, don't wipe your hands
on my shirt!"
"What are you doing, Radhe!"
Don't wipe it with that.
It'll be a sin
What's your name?
- Nirjara Rao
Meaning?
- Meaning? It's my name
It's very a difficult name.
So I asked for the meaning
I don't know
Who named you?
- My mother did
So ask your mother.
- She's dead
Is your father alive?
- Yes
So ask him when you
come tomorrow
All right.
- Thanks
You saved me from sinning
The lunch-box
"When that peacock feather doubles,
give me one!"
"Father, why did Ma
name me Nirjara?"
Because your mother
loved my mother
Your grandma.
Her name was Nirjara Devi too
"What does it mean, father?"
Why do you need to know today?
"Tell me, father. Everybody asks me.
They even tease me"
Nirjara means...
Money?
Here you are
Chandu... give her a cup of tea
"Very well, Radhe bhaiyya"
Nut!
Have patience.
I'm giving it to you
Leave that alone.
What are you doing?
Here you are...
stop bothering me
"Forgive me, Radhe!
It was a mistake!"
I'll never tease a girl again!
I beg at your feet
Please forgive me...
just once!
Drink
Drink it up. Go on
"Binti, if you're going upstairs,
wake up your uncle"
"Let him sleep, Papa.
Today's a Sunday"
"Today's his birthday, silly!
- Birthday!"
Wake him up quickly. We'll get ready
and go to Brindavan for prayers
"How much money, mister?"
"No, sir... how can we take any money
from Radhe bhaiyya?"
"Hello, Radhe bhaiyya!"
See your brother-in-law's reputation?
The flower seller won't
take money from him!
People salute him out of fear.
- They respect me...
and you don't like that either.
- Now look. These things...
Do you want me to go away?
- How will you go away?
You're an amazing man!
It's Radhe's birthday today
"At least stop taunting him today.
Come, let's go"
O Revered Guru...
deign to bless me
"Grant unto me
knowledge and education"
"My child, make some porridge.
Rameshwar likes it"
"Very well, father"
In whose name is the
offering to be made?
In the name of Radhe Mohan
Excuse me...
please come here
Hello.
- Hello
So you are the priest's daughter?
"Yes, we are Brahmins"
"My father says, our forefathers used
to be priests in this very temple"
I know nothing about my forefathers.
What I do know is that...
my great grandfather used to play
hockey for the English team
My grandfather played hockey
with Gyanchand and Dhyanchand
"In extras, too. My father broke
his thumb while playing football"
So he took to selling
hockey sticks
Is that why you beat everyone
with hockey sticks?
What?
- What happened?
Something in my eye
Here... give it some heat
You found out what your name means?
- Yes
What is it?
- Nirjara
Jar means death.
So Nirjara means lmmortality
There's a religious
interpretation too
One's soul is tied to his deeds
Deep meditation frees the soul.
And that is called Nirjara
Here you are.
- What's that?
Gujia
Got a few more?
- Yes
For my niece
Where did you buy it?
- Not bought it. I myself made it
Both are nice
The Gujia and your name too
Your name is nice too
Radhe Mohan is another name
for Lord Krishna. You know that?
"Your attention,
ladies and gentlemen!"
"She first said"ras""
"She then said"gul""
"And then she said"le""
"Listen, ras, gul and le..."
that's how she broke up
the rasgollah!
Thank you very much
She's now going to bore us
to death with a poem
Clear your throat!
"Stars are nothing
but the Sun of the night"
"Like the West
is also East"
We get that!
So what happens next?
"Go on, Nirjara"
They won't let me speak
"North in South,
East in West... so what's new?"
I've taken the trouble
of coming to the stage...
because I've liked her
poem very much
"And since I have liked it,
you will like it too. Get that?"
Those who understand will
quietly listen to the recital...
"and those who don't,
will still sit quietly and listen"
Everything's under control.
Please come
Clap for her
"Stars are nothing
but the Suns of the night"
"Like the West
is also the East"
"The Earth is the daughter
of the Sun..."
"suspended on a bed
in the skies"
"The Sun is an eye-full
of light..."
spread everywhere around
Where are my...
Radhe-ji... my recital is over
"How I love meeting you,
and talking to you"
"What's all this about
and why... I don't know"
But whatever it is...
I love it
"How I love meeting you,
and talking to you"
"What's all this about
and why... I don't know"
But whatever it is...
I love it
"Little things about you,
every meeting we have..."
"they torment me,
when you're not with me"
"What's all this about
and why... I don't know"
But whatever it is...
I love it
"You give a fragrance
to my days and nights..."
"yours is the name
etched on my heart"
"What's all this about
and why... I don't know"
But whatever it is...
I love it
"How I love meeting you,
and talking to you"
"Radhe...?
- Yes, sis-in-law?"
What are you doing here
at this hour of the night?
I couldn't go to sleep.
So I thought I'd read a book
Why do you need a book
so late in the night?
Say something!
Funny!
Stop here
Sister...
haven't your husband
and Rahul come?
This is the limit
"How can he separate a child from
his mother, for the sake of money?"
"God! Atmaram used to make demands
of 20 and 30,000 rupees earlier"
"He's asking for 200,000 now"
"Remaining silent
will not do, Guruji"
We'll have to do something about it
There's no need to do anything.
I don't want to live with that man
I'll find some work here...
I'll help you in your work
I'll raise the money in a few days
and bring back my Rahul
My son must be so harassed
Gardener...
Is this 7\32?
"Yes, it is. So?"
I want to meet the one stays here.
- I'm the one. Go on
Not you. We wish to see Radhe Sir
What for?
- We'll tell him that
Just go and tell him that
there's someone here to see him
All right
Sit down inside.
I'll call him
Who's it?
Are my pants all right?
Go on
So what brings you here?
- Actually...
What's her name?
- Indu
"Indu-ji, will you please
let her speak? Go on"
Actually...
- Say nothing
"First tell me what you will have,
Tea, coffee, a cold-drink?"
"Samosas, biscuits...?
- Nothing"
lmpossible. This is the first time
you've come to my house. Have something
Aslam...
- Yes?
Get some Diet Coke
and samosas from Balwant
He makes excellent samosas.
And listen...
give me a cigarette.
Mine are over
Here you are.
- Come back soon
Aslam... come here
"Yes, brother?
- Who are they?"
They study in our college.
- I see
"Sir, we have a problem"
The exams start tomorrow
and Nirjara is very upset
Why? Hasn't she been studying?
"No, actually...
- She has lost her admission card"
I had kept it in my book.
It has gone missing
So?
- A notice on the college board says...
they won't allow us to appear
for the exams without the card
You have come to me
with such a small problem?
Know what? We'll tear out the
notice board and throw it away
"When the notice board is thrown away,
you can appear for the exams"
Can't we request the Principal?
"Actually, Nirjara...
I don't make requests"
What I say once
is the final call
Piping hot samosas!
Keep it here
Have a diet coke
Here you are
Have some samosas
For you
For you
Have the samosas and coke...
and leave the tension to me
For you
"Is there anything else
I can send, Radhe Sir?"
No thanks. Everything's here.
I don't need anything
Not even you
Catch
The phone won't ring ever
People raise a loan to either
buy a house or for education
But you write the reason as...
I want to pay the money to my in-laws
and bring my son back
You haven't written anything in
the column meant for sureties?
"If I had something to mortgage,
why would I come here for a loan?"
We need some guarantee that you
will repay the loan
You mean honesty
has no value at all?
"In that case, give me your honesty.
I'll create a charge on it, okay?"
Well? Where is your honesty?
- What things are you saying to me?
I don't want any loan from you.
Thank you!
I'll find many
who'll give me a loan
My exams went off well.
But I'm a bit scared
Don't be scared.
God will take care of everything
How did your exams go?
- Very well
"If you want your marks increased,
let me know. I can get it down"
"Oh yes, certainly"
Let her talk to me
"Well, thank you"
"Well, Radhe...? She was profusely
thanking you. What's up?"
She lost her identity card and sought
my help to appear for the exams
That's very careless of her!
Hey girl...
Forget it. She's a decent girl.
- Decent girl means a lovable girl
Which means an innocent girl.
- Which means a good girl
The gentleman appears
to have changed
What do you mean by a good girl?
- She sings well
When did she sing for you?
- She was singing hymns in the temple
His grandma and mine
also sing nice hymns...
but you never went to
the temple to listen to them
My brother and sister-in-law
dragged me there
So she sings nice hymns.
Can't be anything else
Well... what's that called?
Gujia. She makes nice gujias
So you had the Gujias too?
- Yes
Why are you eyes so red?
"I couldn't sleep all night.
- Sleep is lost, peace is lost"
Do you at least feel hungry?
- Radhe bhaiyya's a gone case!
He's fallen in love
with her!
Look at his face!
Isn't he blushing!
Don't talk nonsense!
"Aslam, Radhe appears to have
changed nowadays"
"Love is spoiling him rotten,
sister-in-law"
What? Are you speaking the truth?
- Don't you know?
It's the girl who came
to your house the other day
The one I brought the samosas
and the diet coke for
"Oh yes, I guessed
something was fishy"
"You know the priest, who keeps ringing
the bell without any clothes on?"
She's his daughter.
- Must you talk like that about elders?
"Why not? He's going to be
related to you, isn't he?"
Rascal
"Sister-in-law,
give me a thousand rupees"
At once
"Here, have a laddoo"
I have a sweet-heart.
I don't need laddoos
"You need them badly,
go ahead and eat it"
Here you are.
- What's this? I need only 1000 rupees
Keep it. You might need it.
- Why a couple of thousands?
Stuff five or ten thousand
in his pocket
"It isn't from the money you give me.
It's from my savings, keep it"
"Let's go, Aslam"
Why did you have to give that
good-for-nothing anymore money?
Why do you want to
spoil him even more?
Wrong! It's time for our Radhe
to turn a new leaf
Really? Did you hear that
in a divine announcement?
He has fallen in love
What? Fallen in love?
- Yes
Radhe's in love?
- Yes
I wonder which girl has been
struck by misfortune!
Don't say such inauspicious things.
You didn't ask me who the girl is
As if you won't tell unless I ask
It's the one we met at the temple.
She sang in such a sweet voice
It's the priest's daughter
who even came to our house
Oh yes...
- She reminds me of my sister...
who's no more.
- There she goes again
"The same features,
the same smile and laughter"
"Hurry up, move it"
Move it!
Hey glasses... aren't you satisfied
topping for three years? Get up
This one's old enough to be a mother
and she's still studying
"Watch it, Aslam. She's a lecturer!
- Lecturer?"
"Madam, will you please go out?"
Have you eaten?
Yes
My friends have been
ribbing me of late
"They say, my love story's all set,
all fixed up. But I told them..."
It's another matter that I've changed
a bit over the last week or two
I'm beginning to feel
a sense of responsibility
I'm thinking of
taking up a nice job
"In a beer bar, you know.
The job of a bouncer or a bodyguard"
I don't get a word
of what you're saying
That's exactly what I love about you.
You don't get anything at all
"All right, I'll explain"
Now look at this and this...
carefully
"What happened?
A clap, right?"
It happened when this hand and
this hand came close together
"You're one hand,
I'm the other"
We ought to meet like that
Radhe's using philosophy
to reason with her
"You must be wondering whether my folks
will accept you, isn't it?"
"But you needn't worry.
They are very orthodox, no doubt"
"But if I don't eat for a day or two,
everything will be all right"
"If your father creates any trouble,
right under his ear, on the neck..."
I'll give him a tight slap
"Fifteen days after our marriage,
he won't know where he is"
You heard what I said?
That's full and final
Yes
That...
O ascetic...
I've fallen in love with you
I've fallen in love
"My eyes yearn
to see your face"
"My eyes yearn to see you,
I shed tears when I miss you..."
"on my lips, is your name..."
"in my breath, is your name..."
"my heart...
oh I've lost my heart"
I've fallen in love with you
O hermit...
"Like a lotus blossoming
in moonlight..."
"is your lovely face, my love"
Like a couplet penned in simplicity...
"is your lovely face, my love"
"My eyes yearn to see you,
I shed tears when I miss you..."
"on my lips, is your name..."
"in my breath, is your name..."
"my heart...
oh I've lost my heart"
I've fallen in love with you
"Appear in my dreams,
live in my heart..."
"show me a glimpse of
your beautiful face, my love"
"Without you, my heart
won't be placated anymore..."
"come to me and
don't go away ever"
"My eyes yearn to see you,
I shed tears when I miss you..."
"on my lips, is your name..."
"in my breath, is your name..."
"my heart...
oh I've lost my heart"
I've fallen in love with you
I've fallen in love
You've come to the
canteen after ages...
and you're smiling to yourself?
What's the matter?
There's surely something
brewing in his heart
Don't hide it from your friends.
Tell us... what's it all about?
So you've reached a stage
where you're exchanging gifts!
For your girlfriend?
Radhe... Nirjara
"Chander, what's her brother's name?
- Not brother. It's her fiance"
Rameshwar
But you needn't be worried.
The match isn't finalised yet...
they're only talking about it
"What happened, mister?
- Leave the bike at the stand"
"But what is all this about?
- I'll explain, I'll tell you..."
"will you step aside, please?"
"Master, send a cup of
tea for the gentleman?"
"No tea, send a cup of
special coffee for him"
"No, I won't have any tea or coffee"
It's time for my prayers.
I must go home
God is not running away
"He is where he is,
you can sit here"
Sit down
"So, do you know him?"
"No, who is he?"
You don't know him?
You don't know your own folks?
"You ought to drown out of shame!
He's related to you, you know"
Related? He isn't...?
"What lineage do you
come from, mister?"
Are you going to pickle the lineage?
Not the village...
he's related to you through Nirjara.
- How?
He's your brother-in-law
Brother-in-law
Ponytail
"Go on, your brother-in-law's
calling you"
Yes?
"Look, I'll tell you just once.
Listen carefully"
I have a scene going with her.
- Who?
Nirjara. I've settled it all
with her yesterday
Final. You get that?
"I mustn't see you
with her again, okay?"
"If I see you with her ever again,
I'll set your ponytail on fire..."
and you'll fly into the skies
like a rocket
You get that?
Go away
Poor guy
"You've collected very little
money in the bank, Archana?"
They take away all the money
in the brokerage
"But you're getting a loan, aren't you?
- Of course, why not?"
God! This is the limit!
They've started a brothel
right here in the locality
Stop talking and get to work
"You go to number 3,
and you go to number 4"
The one who owned the house sold it
and went away to Mumbai
These people are not leaving
the locality anymore
God alone knows what's
going to happen now
Nirjara... one moment
I... at the college yesterday...
"nothing, go on"
Not from here.
Go from there
"I'll sit there, Nirjara.
You sit here"
I've brought a gift for you
"I had bought it yesterday,
but ponytail ruined my mood"
It's made to order.
It'll look great in your feet
"No, I don't want it"
Feeling shy?
Why do you have to be shy?
Take it
It isn't how you think it is
"No, it isn't how
you think it is"
It isn't silver.
It's white gold
I don't have at heart
the things you have
"But... in the library you said,
you and I..."
People are watching.
Please don't create a farce
I'm the one who's being
subjected to a farce
Everyone in the college laughs at me.
But I don't care for them
We mustn't worry about them
because...
we have a whole life ahead of us.
Take it now
O God!
I swear it on my education.
I haven't any such thing on my mind
Do you think I lack something?
Have I bad habits?
Am I not a nice man?
"Tell me, I'll change everything"
Nirjara... listen to me
Hands off me!
Thug! Rascal!
I knew this was going to happen!
I had told you to say
I love you to her
I even wished you
a happy married life!
And you go and tell her
that you'll slap her father
"He'll wake up ten days after the
marriage and wonder where he is"
Forget about what has happened
and think of the future
I have an idea.
Know what?
"Woo Indu, Nirjara's best friend.
She'll lure Nirjara for you"
"Shut up! He can't score with one girl,
and you're talking about another!"
I have an idea too
Let's write on the Taj Mahal:
With love from Radhe Mohan to Nirjara
She'll melt the moment
she reads that
Well? Didn't you
like the idea?
"Here, have some grams"
"She called you a thug, didn't she?"
So stop getting into fights
and brawls from today
Turn into a good boy
Your work will be done!
You sway because there's
a girl with you?
I said I'm sorry.
- Will that set everything right?
Save him someone!
Well? You aren't ashamed
are you?
"When you get beaten up, you come to
Radhe Mohan with your tail wagging?"
"In trouble, some people invoke God
and some invoke the devil!"
And there you were...
crying Radhe! Radhe!
"Because we're your friends, must we
get just about anywhere for you..."
and do anything for you?
But if you wear a salwar kameez...
"and come to us with Gujia,
we'll even lick your feet"
Aslam... skip the nonsense
"You hear that? You do?
Go away, get lost"
There's no friend here.
There's only a jilted lover...
who has gone mad for his Juliet
A Juliet who doesn't
care two hoots for him
"Very soon, that Juliet will marry
someone else and cock a snook at him"
Why're you talking to them?
Talk to me
What will I say to you? What?
Are you worth talking to at all?
You want to hit me...?
- Don't show off your body
Hit me!
You hit me...?
"She's marrying someone else,
you say?"
She'll marry and go away!
You think I can live without her?
Tell me! Will I be able
to live without her?
You're my friend
and you curse me!
Lay off!
Hit me! Nirjara's not around!
So why you have stopped?
"For you, sir"
"Chander, my sorry"
"I'm sorry, buddy"
You were the one who told me
to give up fights and brawls...
and become a good boy
I made a mistake
Listen... at least look at me
What is it?
You've softened so soon.
I wish you were Nirjara
Not Nirjara again!
Why don't you forget her?
What can I do?
"I do my best to forget her,
but I can't"
I feel as if...
I've bequeathed
my life in her name
In your name...
in your name...
"in your name,
I have bequeathed my entire life"
"My entire life, my love"
I love you so dearly...
"you are my romance, my love"
"What state has love
brought you to?"
"Even rose-gardens appear to be
the wastelands to me..."
"my loved ones appear to be
strangers to me"
"I'm forever lost
in your memories..."
people call me mad and crazy
Without you...
"without you, life is impossible
to spend, my love"
"Love, I can't be rid of..."
"the bond of love
cannot be broken"
"In the tears
that flow from my eyes..."
"I saw you even among
the Moon and the stars"
"I have burnt in the
fires of separation..."
"yours is the name
my heart chants every moment"
"For you, only for you..."
"for you, I shall bear
every tyranny in the world, my love"
"In your name,
I have bequeathed my entire life"
"My entire life, my love"
In your name...
"I find it very tough, Lord"
I can't even breathe
properly nowadays
Please do me a favour
Give me the strength
to forget her
I'm not sparing you guys!
You hide the good-looking one
and give me the old hag!
You think I'm drunk?
Let me go! Let go of my hand!
- This one's pretty! Oh yes!
Where are you going?
- Help!
Leave her alone!
Who are you?
Who the hell are you?
Wait here! What filth are you
spreading by starting a brothel here!
"Radhe, that chap was teasing
a girl near the brothel"
He hit me!
Go on
"No, not him"
What is it?
Hello
Listen
I've been waiting for a long time.
Have you brought my money?
"That man who brought me here said
I'd be given 200,000 rupees"
"When you go to your in-laws,
you'll get the money there"
Spread out in all the directions
It's my in-laws I've got
to pay the money to
Please ask them to hurry.
I've got to go home
Please give me my money.
- You seem to come from a nice family
But you're a whore.
You ought to be ashamed
What did you say?
You talk rubbish with me...?
I'll slit your tongue!
You're not doing me a favour
by giving me the money!
You're going to collect interest!
But I don't want your money anymore!
I'm going home!
- Wait
You're not going home
"If you step out of this place,
you'll go to the cop-house"
What do you mean?
- Look
This is a brothel
the police have raided
God! Where have I landed?
Throw them in the jeep!
Sit down
I raised my hand at you.
Please forgive me
What's your husband's name?
Where does he work?
His name is Atmaram. He works
at the Public Works Department
"I'm asking for the file,
can't you see?"
It's right there.
Go and get it
Well? What is it?
Who are you?
What are you doing?
Listen to me...
What the hell are you doing?
Why won't you listen to me?
Sharmaji...
My glasses?
Why're you slapping me?
"If you raise your hand,
I'll give you a thrashing"
Enough! Stop it...
What mistake have I made?
Why're you hitting me?
My hands did the talking.
Now I'll explain
Go and bring your wife back
tomorrow morning
"Else, you'll get four slaps at
breakfast and eight at dinner. Okay?"
"If you don't treat her well,
I'll have to visit you again"
Ponytail... what are
you doing here?
"Do you know that man, Radhe-ji?
- No, but that makes no difference"
Brother-in-law...?
"Sister, your husband is here
with Rahul"
What happened to you?
Nothing... it's just...
Mummy...
- Rahul! My son!
"Mamta, pack your bags.
I'm here to take you back"
But the money hasn't been...
- I don't want any money
Forget all that and
just come with me
"Nirjara, listen to me for a minute.
- I have nothing to discuss with you"
What you think about me is not true...
- Why are you bothering me?
"I don't want to listen to anything.
Not a minute, not five..."
"not today, not tomorrow, not ever!
You hear that?"
And don't you dare follow me!
You tease girls in the temple?
What is your name?
Where do you live?
Tell us your name!
The name is Radhe.
- Forgive me
"She went in that direction,
you'll go in the other"
You offered the oil?
- Yes
It's thanks to Him that my sister
has settled down gain
"No, Nirjara. Mamta has settled
down again not because of Him..."
she has settled down
thanks to Radhe
Your sister had landed in a brothel
in trying to raise a loan
Had Radhe not got there
at the nick of the time...
I don't know what calamity
would have struck her
Mamta herself told me about it
He's the one who brought your
brother-in-law to his senses
Which is why he quietly came and
took Mamta back to his house
Radhe didn't even know
that Mamta is your sister
"Just think. When a man,
without any self-interest..."
"helps save another person's family,
is he a bad human being?"
"Yes, I admit he's a bit
hard and wayward"
"For that matter,
even God lives in idols of stone"
But don't we worship Him?
The truth is that
he loves you very much
True love
Think about it.
Did he ever misbehave with you?
Did he ever try to
take advantage of you?
He hasn't even touched you
You must be wondering why
I'm telling you all this
It's because I've realised...
he's a far better human being than me
"Better than you, better than me,
better than thousands of others"
He can even lay down
his life for you
Which is why Radhe Mohan is
your true companion for life
Not me
Take a look at me!
Have you ever seen me like this?
I used to be so happy! But ever
since I've fallen in love with you...
it seems as if my bad times have begun
"I thought people who gave up their
lives for their love, were such fools"
"But now I realise,
why they do it"
"Rather than suffer like me,
they get their freedom in moments!"
But you needn't worry.
I'm not dying
"Because, if I die...
you will become a widow"
And I can't bear to see
you being widowed
The truth is...
Enough! Enough!
I feel like...
"Now look, Nirjara...
I don't want to rape you"
I only want two minutes from you
I want you to hear how I feel.
That's it
I want you to be happy.
And smiling
You get what I'm saying?
Everyone in the world
falls in love
Am I the only one without a right
to love someone...
to have someone love me?
Well?
We'll treat you like a queen
"I, my brother, my sister-in-law,
Binti... and all my friends..."
That boy your father
has chosen for you...
I'm not saying he's not a good guy.
He must be a nice chap
Start calling him your brother.
Or make a friend out of him
I'll accept your friend
I want to give the priest's
daughter a nice life...
and that priest wants to
snatch my life from me?
"As if he's the priest,
and I'm an untouchable!"
What future will
you have with him?
"When I think of it,
about you and him..."
it sends my head reeling.
Like this!
"After listening to all this,
you must surely realise..."
"how dearly I love you?
If you still don't get it, I..."
I know what I'll do!
Go away! Go away!
"Go away, else I'll kill you.
Go!"
But what will I do with my life then?
I don't want to live
a moment without you
Yes! I have forcibly
brought you here!
"And yes, I'm indeed
screaming at you!"
I'm threatening you!
That's only because...
it's because I love you very much
Because I think you were made
only for me... only for me
You were born for me alone
Ask your God! Ask Him!
"I'm going through so much of pain...
so much of misery, God!"
Forgive me
Do please forgive me
"I've draped the scarf...
I dance for you"
"I drape the scarf
and dance..."
for I have lost my heart
"I've fallen in love with you,
I've lost my heart to you"
"Your love gives me a high...
I've lost my heart to you"
"I've fallen in love with you,
I've lost my heart to you"
"I dance, I break every promise..."
"Every promise, I break
and dance today..."
"My bangles speak,
my anklets say..."
"come with the bridal palanquin
and take me away, my love"
With henna on my palms...
"bridal vermillion
on my forehead..."
"I'll dress up
only for you, my love"
"The Spring of my beauty is here...
for I have lost my heart to you"
"I drape the scarf today
and dance for you"
"In your name
I shall bequeath..."
this story of my realisation
"If we are to unite,
we shall unite..."
not to be separated for ages
"I have waited for years, my love"
"Even in pining
I found succour, my love"
I've lost my heart to you
"I've fallen in love with you,
my heart is no longer mine"
"Every promise, I break
and dance today..."
So you're going to make us
shut down our business?
You ought to have kept
your bullying ways to your college
Get up
"You will shut our business down, eh?
Wanna be a hero, eh?"
"Nirjara, how can you
go on like this?"
I want to meet him once
What for?
Why're you unnecessarily
bothering yourself?
"You don't understand, Indu.
- I understand everything"
But is there any point
in all this anymore?
The sooner you get
him out of your mind the better
You understand?
Let's go now. C'mon
Get an injection! Quick!
Where has he gone?
He has survived
But neither can he understand anything
nor recognise anyone
It's really very sad but
every effort of ours...
"to bring about an improvement in
Radhe's condition, has failed"
That's exactly why I wish
to say something to you folks
Of course. Please go ahead
"Although I'm a doctor,
I still believe in God"
Whenever I fall sick...
my mother gives me oblations
before any other medicines
"It has to do with devotion,
it defies logic"
Because prayers and medicines are
both very important in our society
Absolutely
I was going to suggest
something of the sort
You must've heard of Sripurdham?
Although medical science
does not believe in it...
Swami Sheelbhadra uses ancient
cures to heal patients
"If medical science does not believe
it, why must you believe it?"
Do you know? Patients are bound in
chains and treated worse than animals
And you want to send Radhe there?
- That's because...
"in a fit of violence, they shouldn't
hurt themselves or anyone else"
Whatever this boy just said
is not wrong
But it's also true that several patients
like Radhe have been cured there
It has to do with faith
and devotion
"You either have it,
or you don't"
Where is Sripurdham?
Just telephone them
Their workers will come
and personally take Radhe away
What are you thinking of doing?
"What can we think of, Aslam?
We'll have to send him there"
You take just about anyone's
advise seriously!
He spoke in our own interests.
- Really? And what was that?
To not take your brother back home?
To hand him over to some
crazy ascetic?
So that he can try his
mumbo-jumbo on him...?
Even if it leaves your brother dead?
- Aslam!
The doctor's trying
to save his neck...
and these folks don't want anyone
to be a burden on them
"If your brother is such a burden,
don't take him home!"
"I'll take him away. I'll look
after him, I'll nurse him!"
But I'm not letting you send
him to some ascetic's ashram!
Let me tell you that.
And you better listen to me!
Insolent!
I'm the one who has pampered
these boys. It's my fault!
"Else, could anyone
misbehave with you...?"
"Gayatri, calm down"
He's upset because he
loves Radhe so much
Go and sit there
Let him go.
Maybe it's good for Radhe
"Look at me, Aslam"
I can't say whether
I have understood Radhe
But one thing I'm proud of...
he has friends like you
"Forgive me, brother"
You know why I'm sending you
to Sripurdham?
Because I'm fed up of you!
That's it!
I'm sick of your
fights and brawls
I'm tired of reasoning with you!
I now want you to get out
of my sight...
so I can breathe easily!
Do you hear that?
What are you doing?
Look... I've been scolding him.
And he doesn't even talk back
Radhe... I'll sit with you
at the station henceforth
We'll sit outside the college.
We'll act like bullies...
I'll join you too
Just get well...
please get well
"Get well, please"
Sister-in-law...
the van has arrived
to take Radhe away
Why does this happen in love?
Why does loyalty...
not beget loyalty?
Why are good wishes...
not answered with good wishes?
Why is happiness...
not reciprocated with joy?
What does this happen in love?
Love makes you weep...
it makes you forget the world
"It makes you pine,
it makes you restless"
What has love turned people into?
They met their beloveds...
and separated
"All they got was misery
even in Spring..."
"their lifetimes being spent,
waiting for their beloveds"
"Why doesn't a smile
beget a smile?"
"Why isn't loyalty
greeted with loyalty?"
"Time never comes
to a standstill"
Do memories ever cease?
When medicines cease to heal...
what does one do?
"Why isn't joy
greeted with joy?"
"Why isn't loyalty
paid back with loyalty?"
Chander...
no one's telling me how Radhe is.
Where have they taken him?
But you surely know?
Girls are not allowed there
But Radhe will be all right
Don't worry
I've put in a word to God
and He too has told me...
that Radhe will be all right
Praise the Lord...
"See how ardently she
is praying, Rameshwar"
I wonder who's ill
Has she had something to eat?
- No
She's been praying since this morning.
- This morning?
"Yes, a boy in her college is...
- Is...?"
He's lying in the ashram
at Sripur
This girl is just like her mother
She's been fasting and
praying for a stranger
"He's no stranger, Guruji.
- No...?"
That boy belongs to Nirjara's college
and Nirjara...
Yes? Go on.
- She's in love with him
"Nirjara, is what
Rameshwar saying... true?"
"Yes, father"
Lord!
"I've committed no sin, father.
I've done nothing wrong"
What is this if not wrong?
Maybe that boy has
done us favours
He has helped your sister
settle down again
But will you entrust
yourself to him for that?
"I already have, father"
I've given him my heart
And my heart isn't
outside my body
How can you afford
to be so disheartened?
I wasn't ever polite with him
Don't worry
He... he'll return soon
Our Radhe will return.
Just you see
Swamiji...
Swamiji...!
Rameshwarji...
Rameshwarji...
Who is it?
Rameshwarji... please take me
to Radhe. Just once
I'll remain indebted to you
all my life
"All right, we'll leave
in the morning"
Mahantji... Nirjara has gone to
Sripurdham with Rameshwar
A boy from his college
has been admitted there
She said she would
return by nightfall
Here are the keys to your house
The priest is here to meet you.
- Priest?
"Yes, Nirjara's father"
"You've seen what state
he's in, haven't you?"
Do you think we didn't want to
have a daughter-in-law like you?
But perhaps that is
not possible anymore
Had my brother been all right...
I'd have begged your father
for your hand
But to think of him now
and to hope that he...
it's futile. It's over
It's all over
The things man thinks of doing...
and what turns out to be
It isn't right to think only of your
happiness and cause anguish to others
"You know, your father has thought
of nothing but your welfare"
He's the father who has
given you life
You mustn't be obstinate
and drive him to death
"Give him his due, please"
"When is it auspicious to
hold the wedding, holy sir?"
"Friday, July 10 is an
auspicious date for the wedding"
It's all over. Looks like Nirjara
is going to be married to Rameshwar
Why're you hitting him?
- He always talks nonsense!
Radhe's not yet dead.
He's just ill
Wait and see. He'll come back
as soon as he gets well
And when will that be? When?
After the marriage is over?
"No, he'll come soon"
I have a feeling
he's coming back soon
Where are you going?
Get back there
God alone knows
what drove her to consume poison!
"Even in death, we shall
not break our promise"
"We will never part
from each other"
"Ours is a relationship
spanning many births"
"Who has ever separated
life from the body?"
Without you...
"without you, this ocean
has no shore, my love"
"In your name, I have bequeathed
my entire life, my love"
"My entire life, my love"
