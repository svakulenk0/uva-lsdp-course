of other things changed too.
For the worst!

Why the ways they've taken a
tramping through the Lowlands.

Full of larceny, full of larceny.
Very interesting.
Good evening dear friends.
I hurried right down to offer poor
dear Mrs. Ladybug my condolences.
Thank you Mr. Beetle.
Oh, um...
Most fortunate it wasn't
your Honey Shop that burned.
Eh Bumble?
Oh and um...
Of course you realise that
this sort of thing couldn't possibly occur
up there on my estate.
No human one ever intrudes up there.
I guess most of us are like
to feel safe and secure.
That's just the point
Bumble, just the point.
Merely reconsider my offer of
marriage to your charming daughter
and we'll all three live up there
just as snug as three bugs in a rug.
Now what do you say to that Bumble eh?
Well I'm sorry sir but it's
just like I said before.
It's my daughters right to listen

just got "oomph" Mr. Beetle.
Anyway Hoppity's coming back.

Mr . Bumble are you all right?
Hoppity are you?
Father are you hurt?
Uh, just a little shooken' up I guess.
Say, why this is terrible.
Why it's an outrage.
Why nobody's safe in their
own homes or out of them.
Gee-wees, how long has this been going on?
Ever since that big fence has been down.
The fence is down.
The humans come through.
There's only one thing that we can do.
We're in a groove, we gotta' move.
No you smooving. We're doomed to
go and don't forget I told you so.
But jeepers Mr. Creepers we gotta' move.
Where?!
Where?
Hoppity, there isn't anywhere
'cept that garden up next to the big
place where the human ones live.
Well, what's the matter with that?
Not for me.
Me neither.
.
Me neither.
Me neither.
Well, all human ones aren't so bad.
I'm going up and look that place over.
Huh, it can't be much worse
than it is down here.
Oh, can't be any worse eh?
We'll fix that. Won't you boys.
Well Mr. Bumble, the garden ought
to be just over this wall.
Somewhere.
It's no use Hoppity.
You'll never get to that garden with
With a cripple old critter
with a gimpy wing like me
holding you back.
Mr. Bumble.
Gee-wees!
Isn't it beautiful?
Yeah, it's pretty all right but
it's awful close to the big house.
What about those human ones?
I don't think you gotta worry about them.
Anybody that'll keep a garden
like this can't be so bad.
At least I don't think so.
Hay, hay Mr. Bumble.
Look at this.
Just what the boss ordered.
Now you take the high guy
and I'll take the low guy.
What a place to live in!
Well, that's curtains for old man
Bumble and the long legged lug.
Yeah, did we ever get
rid of them in a hurry.
Did we ever.
The boss ought a give us some
fancy sugar for this job.
We better be gettin' out of here Hoppity.
Why it's swell in here Mr. Bumble.
Solid and safe n' dry as a bone.
Over here Mr. Bumble.
In here.
Gimme your hand.
Oh Dick! There's a bee in here.
He'll drown!
Ok girl scout. I'm a-coming to the rescue.
Ok mister. Lets see what'll I do with you.
Say Mary, what'll I do with him?
Have him stuffed?
Ah Dick, don't be silly.
Here let me take that.
There you are Mr. Bumble.
This is where you belong.
Right out here in the garden.
See Mr. Bumble I told you we
belong here in the garden.
The lady human said so.
You heard her.
Gosh and she knew my name.
Called me, Mr. Bumble.
Oh, wait'll we spread the
good news in the Lowlands.
Oh! Well we'll move up here tonight.
So I close to him.
We grapples.

He's up, I'm down.
Up, down, down, up.
Then I definitely wraps his wings

And I'm tying the grasshoppers legs
in a bow knot with a half hitch.
Bravo. Bravo.

We renders them unconscious.
Encompass megabus*
or out of the money.
Them?
Yeah-yeah, the grasshopper and Mr. Bumble.

Uh. Ahem. Nitwits, bunglers. For shame.
To think, that you my trusted aids would
raise your cowardly hands in violence
agents a poor defenseless old nincompoop
_?_ like my dear friend Bumble.
Thereby depriving his only daughter
of her father.
Now it is my painful duty to go down there
and console poor little orphan Honey.
See Mr. Bumble,
I told you we belong in the garden.
Aw gee, it's beautiful.
And plenty of room for everybody.
And the human one said
we could move up there.
Now we can be gay and fancy free.
Bum around, bum around,
keep a bumming round.
We will be as happy as can be.
You and me. You and me. You and me.
After this we'll do as we please.
With a vintage wine
and imported cheese.
And we'll live the life
of Riley you and me.

Hello Hoppity.
Now you've done it Mr. hopper.
In the dog house good and proper.
I knew it tweren't no use to go.
And I won't forget you told me so.
I'll be right back dad. I'm
worried about Hoppity.
O tay o'nny,
don't b lung.
Oh, Mr. Creeper, have you seen Hoppity?
Last I saw of him he was
headed towards the big fence.
Oh!
We're at 19 Moonbeam Terrace,
overlooking Starlight Square.
We're the couple in the castle
way up high in the air.
On the corner there's a cloud bank,
and we bank our millions there.
We're the couple
in the castle
in the air.
One day a daydream
came a stealing through
the gloomy part of town.
Well, that daydream
brought us way up here
and we'll never come down
call us Lord and Lady Stardust,
call us crazy,
we don't care.
We're the couple
in the castle
in the air.
Well, that's it Mary.
How do you like it?
Oh Dick, it's a beautiful song.
Beautiful.
Well I hope the publishers agree with you,
to the tune of a nice fat check.
I know they will and we can...
Meet the payments on this house
before they take it away from us.
Yes and we could fix up the lower garden
and the fence that's broken down
where the people walk through.
Of course its to to bad your young
friend had to fail so miserably, Bumble.
But under the circumstances,
wouldn't it be well to consider my
offer of marriage to your daughter.
I suggest you discuss the matter
with her at once, Bumble.
Well I'll...
I... ah... ah...
Achoo!
Mr. Bumble. Mr Bumble!
The human ones there going to
fix the fence and there also...
Oof.
Oh!
Uh-oh!
Pardon me Mr. Beetle.
Oh now Hoppity.
Honest Mr. Bumble!
The lady human knows all
about that fence being down.
And those humans coming through.
And, and there gonna fix that fence
as soon as that check thing arrives.
A check thing?
Whats that?
Well, I heard them say it comes in a
letter. That the post man brings.
The post man?
What's the post man?
You know the human one with
the stripes on his legs
and a bag
and makes a noise like this.
Hurry up. Get going . And no slip ups.
Understand.
Why that's strange,
I thought I heard the mailman whistle.
Psst. Psst. Quick over here with it.
Over here with it.
In there. Out of sight.
Hurry!
Where's the letter?
Such suspense.
Hoppity said, it would fix the fence.
The fence is down the humans come through.
Without the letter what'll we do?
Them that are bow are doomed to
go and don't forget I told you so.
Where is the letter that supposed to come.
To stop the damage that's being done.
The fence is down.
The humans come through.
Where's the protection promised by you?
Where's the check thing you talked about?
That's supposed to keep the humans out.
The fence isn't fix. The
humans come through.
What Hoppity told us is all untrue.
Still no letter.
Such suspense.
Hoppity said, it would fix the fence.
Corner there's a cloud bank,
and we bank our millions there.
Ta ta to too
in the castle
in the air.
Dick, here's a letter it's...
From the publishers?
No. No it isn't.
It's a foreclosure notice.
It says, we got to move out of the house.
Oh Dick, the home you inherited
from your grandfather.
Yeah.
Along with its creaking old
mortgages and tax liens.
You know Mary, I think it's gonna be a
kinda' relief to be free from all that.
Anyway...
If they say we gotta go, why...
We gotta go. So-ho!
Where do we go from here boys?
Where do we go from here?
Well well, I wonder what the folks
in the Lowlands are going to do now?
With the building covering their property.
Yeah boss, and on your property too. Huh?
Yes on my prop...
My property!?!
What!!!
A building on my property!
Why I'll be ruined!!!
They can't do this to me.
- Well I'll... I'll...
- Is that bad boss?
That ain't so good?
Of course it isn't. My
property will be useless.
I'm sunk.
Then you might just as well give
your property away. Eh boss?
Give my property away.
No.
Hum...
Give it away.
Worthless.
Give my property away.
Yes!
Yes that's it!
Boys I'm about to make a
very generous gesture.
I am going to give my property to the
residents of the Lowlands community.
All my worthless property.
Your sure are a pa-lan-thro-pus boss.
You sure a palanthropus.
Yes yes. Provided of course that
Miss. Honey Bee will accept
my offer of marriage.
Well if it isn't my old friend Hoppity.
How long have you been listening.
I-I mean standing there.
Just ling enough Mr. Beetle.
To overhear your whole cowardly scheme.
But your not gonna get away with it!
Cause I'm going down and
tell the Lowlanders
just what kind of an insect you are.
Oh, oh, oh, now don't be hasty young man.
Swat, Smack go get him!
Hay Smack, gimme a hand! Gimme a hand!
Put up your dukes! I'm gonna
bust you in the head!
I-I-I smack you!
I'll mobileize you.

Huh, so you thought you could
outsmart C. Bagley Beetle ay.
Come on now, get up and fight like a man.
You double crossing beetle.
I'll...
Let go of me. Let me get my hands on him.
Why.. Wh..
Why that's the letter the
human ones were waiting for.
To fix the fence.
Why you no good...

And I couldn't get down here to warn ya'.
Hoppity! Hoppity!
Hay! Hay, wait for me!
I know it's sort of silly
to come back here Dick.
But I just had to see what
they're doing to our old place.
It's not our place anymore Mary.
Oh Dick if only the publishers
had bought your song.
I'm still hoping they will.
Wouldn't do much good now. It's to late.
Look! There it is!
Not much room for a house and garden here.
Unless, you wanna live on the roof Mary.
Oh we could Dick.
We could build a cottage right here.
Our castle in the air.
You could have your garden over here.
With the lilly pond.
And the potted shrubs.
Oh wouldn't that be wonderful?
If we got the check.
The check!
The letter with the check!
Look here it...
Hay! Hay wait everybody wait!
Now listen. We gotta go up!
Up to the top.
If we stick together why
everything is gonna be all right.
I heard um say so.
Aw, you heard um. Like that
check thing you heard about.
Yeah yeah that's it the check thing.
And they're gonna have a garden up there.
Just like it was down below only nicer.
And safe.
Oh no. Not for me. I've
heard all that before.
I'm a getting out of here.
Oh no. Don't go Mr. Creeper!
Please don't go!
Don't anybody go away now.
We gotta stick together.
Lead the way Hoppity.
Lets go.

Oh I'm sorry, Mr. Dickens
doesn't live here anymore.
Come on everybody lets go.
See, we just ride this here escalator
up to the sand truck and...
And we rides away.
Safe as a little baby in a cradle.
Hay boss, are ya' all right?

Hay come on boss.

We just gotta get to the top.
Top! Top of what?
Why the top of the... Oh.
Gosh.
Gosh, I just can't believe it.
I was sure it would be here.
Oh sure, keep going, stick together.
Everything is going to be just
lovely when we get to the top.
We'll were at the top! And where's
this paradise we heard so much about?
Mrs. Laaaadybug.
Ambrose, Murgatroyd!
Come away from there this minute!
We're at 19 Moonbeam Terrace,
Oh look! Look everybody! Look!
Oh look! Look everybody! Look!
Overlooking Starlight Square.
Hoppity! Oh Hoppity!
We're the couple in the castle
way up high in the air!
On the corner there's a cloud bank,
and we bank our millions there.
And we bank our millions there
Aw, gee-wees!
We're the couple in the castle
in the air.
One day a daydream
came a stealing through
the gloomy part of town.
Well, that daydream
Gee, don't they look lovely together?
Yeah, very romantic.
And Lady Stardust,
call us crazy, we don't care.
Hay, Murgatroyd.
Look at the human ones down there.
They look just like a lot of little bugs.
