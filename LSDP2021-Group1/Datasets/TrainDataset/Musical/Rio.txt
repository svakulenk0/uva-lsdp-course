Hey!
All the birds of a feather
Do what we love most of all
We are the best at
rhythm and laughter
That's why we love Carnaval!
Call so clear we can sing to
Sun and nature's big moon
Dance to the music
Passion and love
Show us the best you can do!
Everyone here is on fire
Get up and join in the fun
Dance with a stranger
Romance and danger
Magic can happen
For real in Rio
All by itself!
You can't see
it coming
You can't find it
anywhere else!
it痴 real in Rio
And know something else
You can't feel
it happening
You can't feel it
all by yourself!
It's okay. It's okay.
I値l take care of you.
Stupid clock.
Huh?
Good morning, Blu.
Eww.
Come here!
Tyler Blu Gunderson !
You know these vitamins
are good for you.
Ooh !
What's this?
Gotcha!
LINDA: Enjoy
the new book!
Thanks, Linda!
Bye, now.
Yes, Mom,
I壇 love to visit,
but who would
take care of Blu?
Mom ! They don't have
kennels for parrots.
Here's your hot
chocolate, Blu !
Just how you like it.
Plus, l don't trust
leaving Blu with
just anyone.
No, l don't have
a bird-sitter.
This is the life.
The perfect marshmallow-
to-cocoa ratio.
One, two, three,
four, five, six.
Mmm.
Well, well, if it isn't
my favorite nerd bird.
Very funny.
Real mature.
Hey, pet!
Where you migrating
to this year?
The breakfast nook?
Throw all the
snowballs you want.
I'm protected by this
magical force-field
called glass.
it's what keeps us
so toasty and warm in here
while you guys
are out there
freezing your. . .
Classy.
Are you all right?
I知 not really built
for this weather.
Oh. Are you looking
for some books?
Books? No. No.
l have come 6,000 miles
looking for him.
LINDA: Doctor
of Ornithology?
Ooh !
He's magnificent.
Linda? Little help
here. Linda!
Wow!
You're actually
communicating.
Yes! l introduced myself
and shook my tail feathers
counter-clockwise
thus deferring
to his dominance.
l did not get
that at all.
So, Dr. Monteiro. . .
No "Doctor," please,
just call me Tulio.
You know, your macaw
is a very special bird.
In fact,
as far as we know,
Blu is the last male
of his kind !
Really?
Yes,
and recently,
we found a female
and our hope is to bring
the two of them together
to save their species.
Oh.
Well, yeah, sure,
when can she come over?
No, no.
She is in Brazil.
Blu must come
to Rio de Janeiro.
Rio? Brazil?
No. No, no, no.
l never let Blu
out of my sight.
He needs me.
No. You misunderstand.
it痴 all arranged.
You will be with him
every step of the way.
And l will be with you.
Look, l know
you're doing your job,
but l can't. . .
Well, Blu is
very particular.
And we have
our little routine here
and we're not
big on travel.
Heck, he doesn't
even fly!
But of course
he can fly!
He's a perfect specimen.
What are you doing?
Don't worry,
their natural instincts
always take over.
Wait, wait, wait!
No, no!
Well, almost always.
Blu !
What kind of
doctor are you?
Are you okay?
Perhaps, he's too
domesticated.
It was very nice
of you to stop in
and squawk around
and throw my bird.
But now it's time
for you to go.
I知 very sorry.
I知 very sorry, but. . .
Wait, wait,
Linda. Linda!
This could be
our last chance.
Have a safe flight.
Linda, please,
listen to me.
lf we don't do this,
his whole species
will be gone!
Just think about it.
BLU: Natural instincts!
There is nothing natural
about being thrown
halfway across the room.
Well, I'll show him.
l can do this.
l just have to work
out the physics.
l have quadrated
my vector angles.
I've adjusted
for wind shear.
Positive reinforcement.
Good.
Okay, let's see.
Flaps open. Perfect.
Landing gear. Check.
Tail flaps. Operational.
And, actually, not bad.
This is it.
Let's fly.
Just keep it simple.
Thrust, lift,
drag and weight.
Thrust, lift,
drag, weight.
Thrust, lift, drag. . . Wait!
Ow!
Blu?
l promised l would
always look out for you,
didn't l?
And have l ever
broken a promise?
I知 scared, too
but l wouldn't
make you do this
if it wasn't the
right thing to do.
What do you say, Blu?
That's my big,
brave boy.
And we'll be back home
before we even know it.
Let me take you to Rio, Rio
Fly over the ocean
like an eagle, eagle
Then we can chill
in my gazebo, gazebo
Let me take you to Rio, Rio
Fly over the ocean
like an eagle, eagle
Then we can chill
in my gazebo, gazebo
Your turn, Blu !
You don't want
to get beak-burn.
Whoa!
Whoa! What is
going on here?
You arrived in time
for Carnaval !
Carnaval?
Yes, it's the biggest
party in the world.
You know,
a time to have
fun and dance!
Oh, my!
Is she a performer?
No, in fact,
she's my dentist.
Dr. Barbosa!
Don't forget
to floss, Tulio!
You got it!
Come tomorrow night,
everyone will be
dressed like that.
Not me.
Oh, right yeah.
l am not from here.
Hey, Nico,
he's a tourist!
Funny, you don't
look like one.
Really? l don't?
Except you got
pigeon doo-doo
on your nose.
Oh, no, this is
just SPF 3000.
So, are you here
for Carnaval?
Actually, I知 just here
to meet a girl.
Oh. . .
A girl !
Yes!
Little word of advice,
you make the first move.
Brazilian ladies
respond to confidence.
Oh, right.
Yeah, it's all
about swagger.
You got to puff
out that chest!
Swing that tail !
Eyes narrow,
like some kind of
crazy love-hawk!
But first we got
to bust you out.
What?
Yeah ! I知 gonna
pop that cage open
like a soda can !
No, no. Wait!
No, no, no,
that's okay.
You call that popping?
This thing is robust.
No, no, guys,
really, I知 fine.
The cage is great.
Love the cage!
Suit yourself!
Don't forget, love-hawk!
Yes, yes, Bem...
And to you, as well.
Let me take you to Rio, Rio
Fly over the ocean
like an eagle, eagle
So we can chill
in my gazebo, gazebo
This is the heart
and soul of our aviary.
Our treatment room.
They really like you.
A lot.
Yes. I知 their great,
big mama bird.
Eww.
Wow!
Want some?
Oh, I知 good.
Many of the birds here
were rescued
from smugglers.
Smugglers?
Yes! And
unfortunately,
the poor birds
are often hurt
or even killed
in the process.
But with proper care,
they can be saved.
Look here.
This poor guy was
found last night.
Hey, buddy! You're
looking great today.
Much better, much better!
Get well soon !
Oh !
So, where is Jewel?
We have a special
place for Jewel.
She's a very
spirited bird.
I値l say.
She did that?
Charming. Okay,
l want to go home now.
No, no. Don't worry.
I知 going to make you
look irresistible.
Help! Help!
Let me out of here!
Linda!
Maybe l should. . .
No, no.
Give it a chance.
Hello?
l come in peace.
BLU: Whoa.
She's beautiful.
What were they
talking about?
She's like an angel.
An angel who's
getting really close...
You're standing
on my throat.
Oh, you're
an American.
Thanks.
l need my throat for
talking. So, thank you.
You look like me.
Hi.
Hi, my name is Blu.
Like the cheese
with the mold on it.
You know, that
smells really bad.
That's stupid.
Stupid, stupid, stupid.
Come on.
We don't have much time.
Wait, wait, wait.
Are you ready?
For what? Oh ! Oh.
Wow. Okay.
Confidence.
Crazy love-hawk.
All right.
Whoa, what
are you doing?
What? What you
wanted me to.
But just for argument's sake,
what are you doing?
l am trying to escape.
Yeah, escape, that's
where l was going
with that thing l just did.
Wait, wait.
Did you actually think
we were going to kiss?
No! it痴 not what you think.
We just met.
Oh, my.
l think they need
a little help.
l know how
my feathers look,
but l am not
that kind of bird.
Say you, say me
Okay, l had nothing
to do with that.
But, you have to admit
it's actually a pretty
good song.
Naturally
Yeah, sing it, Lionel.
Wow. That was fast.
Lionel Richie
works every time.
We should probably give
them some privacy.
I知 not so sure
l should leave Blu
here alone.
No, don't worry.
Sylvio will keep an eye
on them all night.
Besides, he's got Jewel.
Help me!
This is the final
countdown to Carnaval!
Let's samba!
Oh. . .
Come here,
poor little birdie.
it痴 okay, l got you.
l got you.
Excuse me.
Please, l am
trying to sleep.
I知 sorry, sleepy-head,
I知 trying to escape.
Escape? Why?
This cage is awesome.
This. . .
Oh, what was l thinking?
l wouldn't expect
a pet to understand.
Pet? Did you just
call me a pet?
For the record,
l am not a pet.
l am a companion.
And you know what?
Do whatever you want
'cause tomorrow morning,
Linda will come for me
and this whole nightmare
will be over.
Incredible!
You would rather be
with a human than
with your own kind.
Well, that human
has given me love
and affection
for the past 1 5 years
whereas my own kind
try to strangle me
after 1 5 seconds.
Yeah, well, because of them,
I致e lost everything.
You can't trust them.
BLU: Of course. . .
you can trust humans.
Jewel? Jewel?
Hi, there.
TULIO: It was nice of you
to join me for dinner.
l often eat alone.
Because, of course,
my work.
l thought l was the bird
nut until l met you.
Yes, right.
Do you have
a favorite bird?
Well, obviously,
I知 a blue macaw
kind of gal.
That makes sense.
They are very
handsome birds.
Actually, it's the brains
I知 more attracted to.
I知 not so impressed
by fancy feathers.
l know exactly
what you mean.
My favorite bird
is the spotted owl.
I致e always
been mesmerized
by those big. . .
round, intelligent eyes.
Chicken hearts?
Chicken hearts!
Oh, gosh.
Oh. . .
Oh.
Hello?
Oh, Blu.
We should have never
left Moose Lake.
This is all my fault.
No, no, Linda,
Linda, please.
This is not your fault.
You're right.
it痴 not my fault.
it痴 your fault!
What?
With your little
bird talk.
And that whole
"save the species."
Well, you know what?
Squawk, squawkity,
squawk, squawk!
I知 sorry.
l didn't mean to curse.
l don't understand.
Sylvio is the best guard
in the business.
POLICEMAN: So, let me
get this straight.
You were attacked
by a little white bird?
Yes, with this rag.
He held it to my
mouth like this.
We're doomed.
Okay. There's no
place like home,
there's no place
like home.
How l wish l was
back in my own cage
with my mirror and my swing,
and my little bell.
How l miss
my little bell.
Play dead.
What? l don't need
to play dead,
I知 about to have
a heart attack.
Just do it!
Fine.
Stop twitching.
Come on, it's the
twitching that sells it.
Come on in, kid.
Well, what do you know?
Good work, Fernando.
You see, boys?
What did l tell you
about this one?
That you were going
to pay him half as
much as you said?
No, you idiot.
That he reminds me
of myself when
l was that age.
Smart, resourceful.
Here you go, kid.
Hey. This is only half
of what you promised me.
Ah, shut up, kid.
What the. . .
l thought l told you
l needed these birds alive.
Tell me, Fernando. . .
does this look
alive to you?
Get her!
Come over here!
Jewel !
Come here!
NIGEL: Hello. . .
pretty bird.
What's the matter?
Cockatoo got your throat?
MARCEL: Nigel !
Alive.
To be continued.
That was your plan?
To take off and leave me?
Gee, thanks.
Well, why didn't
you follow me?
Uh. . .
Nice work, Nigel.
Yeah, nice work, Nigel.
The last blue macaws
on earth.
These are worth a fortune.
Hey, Fernando,
hang these up
in the other room.
BIRD 1 : Hey, birdie!
Let me out! Let me out!
Let me out of here!
BIRD 2:
Who's a pretty bird?
I知 a pretty bird.
Pretty bird,
I知 a pretty bird.
I知 a pretty bird.
l was framed.
They got the wrong guy.
Sorry, guys.
Nothing personal.
So, what's going
to happen to them?
Don't worry,
we're going to find
good homes for them.
Now go home
to your mama.
But l don't have a mama.
Father?
Brother?
Goldfish?
Can we keep him, boss?
No.
TIPA: So, Marcel,
what's really going to
happen to those birds?
Plucked, stuffed,
eaten, who cares?
All l know is
we're going to be rich.
ARMANDO: We're gonna be rich !
Come on, come on !
The game is starting !
Yes, you were very clear.
Tomorrow or the deal is off.
Of course l have
both the macaws.
Yes, l will deliver
them myself.
All right, you two. . .
you load the truck tonight.
And first thing
in the morning,
we bring those birds
to the airport.
You got it?
Yeah, sure.
All right. Heard you.
And one of you,
feed Nigel.
Rock, paper,
scissors, shoot!
Yes!
Nuh-uh,
scissors cuts rock.
Oh, man. How come
you always win?
Nice birdie.
Here you go.
Cannibal.
Okay, pull it together.
The key is not to panic.
I知 not panicking.
l wasn't talking to you,
l was talking to me.
But it's okay,
because any minute now,
Linda will find us.
Great. And then
she'll stick us behind
another set of bars, right?
Yeah. l mean, no.
Look, pet, cages
might work for you,
but l don't want
to belong to anyone.
Something seems to be
lodged in my beak.
Would you mind?
l know I知 not
a pretty birdie. . .
but l used to be
quite a looker.
A star.
Lights, camera, action.
l was striking,
suave, ambitious.
Feet to beak...
so birdie-licious
Now I'm vile,
I am villainous,
and vicious
Oh, and malicious
l had it all
A TV show, women, too
l was tall
Over one-foot-two
Then they got a
pretty parakeet
to fill my shoes
That's why l am so evil,
why l do what l do.
CHORUS: He was a super star
So young and vital
He's nasty
A South American Idol
He's a suspicious bird
Who said that about me?
A very vicious bird
I値l have you rotisseried
I知 a feathery freak
With a beak
A bird murderer
You think you're
badder than me?
l never heard of ya
I'm evil,
I値l fill your cheese balls
with weevils
l poop on people
and l blame it on seagulls
It was him.
He's a nasty bird
I知 invincible
He's ghastly
I知 un-mince-able
I'm unwashable, unrinseable
Like an abandoned school
l have no principle
All of you Brazilian birds
All 80 million birds
I値l tell you what
I知 going to do
I知 going to make you
Shut up, now. Shut up!
it痴 just me.
l will make you ugly...
...too.
BLU: Hey!
Sweet nightmares.
Not cool, man !
Scary, but not cool !
Hey, are you okay?
No, l am definitely
not okay!
Wait. What are
you doing?
Getting out of here.
Are you going to
help me or what?
Actually, all the
survival guides
say to sit and wait,
and help will come.
No one is coming !
We are on our own
and if we just sit here,
we're going to die!
Yes! Yes!
Yes!
No!
ARMANDO: Nigel !
Get out of the way!
Hold on !
Stop! Stop!
Why don't you just
open the door?
Are you kidding me?
What? it痴 just
a standard
flip slide bolt.
Come on ! Let's fly!
What are you doing?
l can't.
What? You can't what?
l can't fly!
You couldn't tell me
this before now?
It didn't matter
before now!
l hate you.
Is there anything else
l need to know?
Yes, l can't fly,
l pick my beak,
and once in a while
l pee in the bird-bath.
Happy?
There they are!
We got to get
out of here!
Just move! Move!
Wait, wait.
Listen to me.
Flying may not
be my thing,
but walking is.
Follow my lead.
Inside leg, outside leg.
Yeah, okay,
l got it.
Inside, outside,
inside, outside!
Yes! Yes! Yes!
Yes. Yes!
Come on !
See? I知 bilingual, too!
This is great!
I知 chained to the
only bird in the world
who can't fly!
Actually, there are
about 40 species
of flightless birds.
Duck!
No, ducks can fly.
No! Duck!
Yay!
ALL: Yes!
Yes!
Hold on !
NIGEL: No!
No!
ALL: No!
Get out of here,
you putrid poultry!
What was that?
A stick.
And that?
it痴 just a rock.
Right. Yeah.
Is that a spider
on my back?
Will you quit it?
it痴 just a leaf.
Turn around.
Leaf. Told you.
Now, come on, we need
to find a safe place
to spend the night.
Safe? Safe?
We are in the jungle.
You know when people say,
"it痴 a jungle out there"?
Well, I知 pretty sure
they don't mean it
as a good thing.
Look, l hate to
break it to you,
but this is where our
kind naturally lives.
Hey, don't talk
to me about nature.
I watch Animal Planet.
l know all about
the food chain.
You see?
Out here, I知 just an
hors d'oeuvre.
Nothing more than
a feathery spring roll.
That is why we stay
in the trees and
not on the ground.
After you.
No,
l don't think so.
Nuh-uh. No.
l would feel much
more comfortable
in something man-made.
Hey, how about
up there?
l can't believe
l have to drag your
clumsy butt up there.
Drag me?
Watch and learn.
Oh !
Blu ! Just wait one. . .
Blu?
Who's dragging
whose butt now?
Ha ha. Very funny.
You see?
Who needs flying?
Birds. Birds
need flying.
Flying is. . .
it痴 freedom
and not having
to rely on anyone.
Don't you want that?
l don't know.
It sounds a little lonely.
Let's get some sleep.
I知 probably
going to be up
for a little while.
Because I知 still
on Minnesota time.
Good night.
Good night, Jewel.
Good night, Linda.
Excuse me, sir?
Have you seen my bird?
Mmm-mmm.
Excuse me?
Have you seen my bird?
Have you
seen my bird?
Blue feather.
Lady! American lady!
Blu?
Where?
Wow. l know where
your birds are.
You found Blu?
Are you sure?
it痴 his!
Let me see that.
You're right.
Okay. Where is he?
Come on, let's go!
I値l take you to him.
No, no. Linda, wait.
We don't know this boy.
We can't trust him.
l have to trust him.
l don't have a choice.
Do you think
I知 an idiot?
They were two birds
chained together in a cage.
How could you lose them?
They outsmarted us, boss.
But don't worry,
we'll get them back.
l have a plan.
Great. What are
you going to do?
Wander the city
calling "Here birdie,
birdie. Here birdie"?
Well, anything sounds dumb
when you say it like that.
Okay. We have
to get the birds to
the airport tonight.
But it's Carnaval.
All the roads will be
blocked by the parade.
And that's why
l wanted to go
this morning.
Nigel.
This bird is 1 0 times
smarter than the two
of you combined.
Yeah, well,
if he's so smart,
then why don't you
put him in charge?
l am putting
him in charge.
Stop suggesting things.
Go find them, Nigel.
Hmm.
lf we can't get
through the parade,
we'll have to be
in the parade.
Huh?
JEWEL: Are you sure
this is going to work?
Positive.
Check out my math.
Yeah, that's comforting.
Thank you.
Look, let's just get
this chain broken.
Right. Then we can
go and find Linda.
No, you can
go find Linda.
Once this chain is off,
I知 going to go back
to being free in the
jungle. Deal?
Fine. Deal.
Nice try, brainiac.
l think something
is watching us.
Be careful, Blu.
They might snuggle
you to death.
Come here.
Ow!
Intruders!
Cut it out!
Now stop. . .
No! Don't!
Attack!
BLU: Help!
What's going on
down there?
Go, go. Off with you.
Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!
I致e told you
a thousand times.
Manoela, Sofia,
come on now, listen to me.
Oh, yeah,
right in the eye.
Precious, aren't they?
Kids? Seventeen of them
and one on the way.
Hey! He's not a maraca,
stop shaking him !
They're giving me
gray feathers.
This papa needs a break.
So, you two lovebirds
headed for Carnaval?
Whoa! Lovebirds?
We're more like
acquaintance-birds.
Not even that,
we're more like chained-
to-each-other birds.
Yeah. l mean, if. . . Ow!
What is it with this kid
and the feathers?
We have no idea.
We're having him tested.
So, do you think
you could help us
get this thing off?
Lucky for you,
you know Rafael,
and Rafael knows everyone.
Again with the eye.
Okay, want me
to call your mother?
KIDS: No!
Works every time.
They're scared
to death of her.
Call me for what?
Eva, my love. . .
l must take
this young couple
to see Luiz.
Luiz!
You don't fool me
for a second.
You and your amigo
just want to sneak off
to Carnaval.
Carnaval.
That magical time when
l met the most beautiful
bird in the world.
Oh !
Ugh.
l still remember the song
that was playing when
l first laid eyes on you.
Tall and tan and
young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema
goes walking
Come on, baby, sing it!
And when she passes,
each one she passes goes, ah!
Like a river of
the sweetest honey.
Oh. l guess
love is deaf, too.
Come here.
ALL: Eww.
Okay. Take them to Luiz,
but hurry back.
You are an angel.
I値l miss you
my juicy little mango.
I値l miss you
my pudgy papaya.
Hey! Marco! Carlos!
Put your brother down, now!
l can't believe
she actually let me go.
So, how far
is this Luiz?
Not far. Thirty minutes
as the crow flies.
And how long as
the macaw walks?
Bobo here can't fly.
But he's a bird.
Not all birds fly.
There are ostriches. . .
You're not an ostrich.
Not technically, but. . .
Wait.
My friends, l want to help,
but to walk the whole way. . .
It can't be done!
KID: Where's Daddy?
Daddy? Daddy?
Come over here.
Go back to your room.
But, hey.
We might as well
give it a shot.
Let's go quickly.
No, don't look back.
They sense fear.
What an adorable monkey.
Hey! My watch !
Hello, boys.
Seems like you've
had a busy day.
What? This?
This is just some
stuff we found.
Right, boys?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I知 not interested
in your nicked knick-knacks.
Your burgled baubles bore me.
There are two blue
macaws out there
and l need your
multitude of eyes
to help me find them.
Oh, yeah?
What's in it for us?
Well, that's
a fair question.
Let's discuss it.
l certainly
see your point,
but what could l possibly
do for you in return?
Save me! Save me!
Well, that's
a thought. Yeah.
But is it enough?
l don't want to feel
like I知 cheating you.
Help me!
Help me! No, no!
We'll do it, we'll do it.
Save me, please.
Save me!
All right,
you've twisted my wing.
Deal.
Now then?
Any more questions?
No? Good.
You will spread out and
you will find these macaws
by the end of the day
or it's flying lessons
for everyone!
Go!
Go do your
monkey business.
I致e changed
my mind, yeah.
Maybe we can find
a bus schedule
or something.
Come on, you're not
going to back out now.
Not in front of the lady.
Okay, yeah.
Yeah, sure.
All right,
that's the spirit.
You're sure
you're up for this?
Yeah, yeah. l mean,
it's not like we're
just hurling ourselves
off a mountain or something.
Right?
Actually that
was pretty much
my entire plan.
What?
Don't worry, Blu,
it's in your DNA.
And if our featherless
friends can do it,
how hard can it be?
MAN: Wait, wait!
Mommy!
Fun, right?
Yeah. Fun.
Okay. l need you
two to get closer.
Closer.
Nice.
Now put your wings
around each other.
What?
Come on, amigo!
it痴 not like
she's going to bite!
Will you?
We'll see.
Now,
you flap your right wing,
you flap your left wing,
and together you fly.
But this doesn't seem
aerodynamically possible.
You think too much.
Flying is not what
you think up here,
it's what
you feel in here.
And when you feel
the rhythm of your heart,
it's like samba.
You fly!
See? it痴 easy!
Easy?
Easy for you to say,
because from here
it looks really,
really hard.
Hey, if you want
to see Linda again,
this is the only way.
Okay. You're right.
Yes, l am.
This is for Linda.
Right.
Keep it simple.
Easy breezy.
Thrust, lift, drag. . .
Come on ! Let's go!
Wait!
Inside, outside,
inside, outside.
Come on, Blu !
You can do it!
BLU: l can do it.
l can do it.
l can do it.
l can't do it!
Not again !
Am l dead?
No!
We're still alive!
Wow! This is incredible.
Wow.
This is the most
beautiful thing
I致e ever seen.
See what you've
been missing?
Yeah.
All right, Blu,
you're flying !
Sort of. Not really,
but do you feel it?
Yes!
l do feel it.
No, no, Blu ! Wait!
Sorry, sorry, sorry.
We're gonna die!
You did not
feel it in here.
You think?
Let's catch
a ride to Luiz.
Hurry, you two!
Okay.
Last of the species here.
Move it!
Hey. Wait up.
Come on, lovebirds!
You made it.
l would love to go
five minutes without
almost getting killed.
Is that too much to ask?
For a bird who
can't fly, oh, yeah.
TULIO: They're starting
to close off the
streets for Carnaval.
You better be right, kid.
Because we're
running out of time.
I値l never
be able to get my car
through this crowd.
Don't worry,
I知 on it.
Watch it!
Hey, kid, how did
you get this bike?
l traded it for your Jeep.
What?
Yeah, it's in
great condition.
Well, good condition !
Hey! Out of the way!
Look out!
FERNANDO: Hold on !
Ow!
I知 going to chew
through my own leg
if this doesn't
come off soon.
Relax. lf l know Luiz,
we're right where
we want to be.
NICO: Hey! Rafi !
lf it isn't the king
of Carnaval !
Nico! Pedro!
What up, family?
Where you been
hiding yourself, bird?
Man, l thought
you were dead.
Hold up! Rewind.
Ain't that the bird
from the cage?
l think our love lessons
went down smooth.
You work fast.
Baby got beak.
You was locked up
and now you're rolling
with a hot-wing.
l want to be like you.
No, it's not what you think.
We're just chained together.
Hey, I知 not judging you.
Keep it spicy.
Oh, yeah.
Hey, guys,
we're looking for Luiz.
Have you seen him?
Yeah, l seen him,
but you didn't,
because you
just missed him.
He took the trolley
back to the garage.
Great.
Relax, baby bird.
You could catch
the next one.
Yeah, it's time to take it
to the next level.
What's wrong
with this level?
Come on ! This ain't the level.
The next level's the level.
You got to shake
your tail feathers.
We got to get
this chain off first.
Come on, lovebirds!
You're in Rio!
You should enjoy it!
Yeah ! Live a little.
We got them.
BIRD: Hey!
Welcome to paradise!
Some party, huh?
This is the coolest place
I致e ever seen.
Despite all the obvious
health code violations.
l like you !
Nothing you say
makes any sense.
All right, everyone,
listen up!
Rafi has some special
guests from out of town
and let's show
them some love,
because l don't think
they get out much.
Yo, yo, yo.
Everybody put
their wings together
and clap them as
loud as you can.
Flap them. Clap them.
l don't care, slap them.
Party in the Ipanema, baby.

'Cause once we start it
Baby, ain't no,
ain't no stopping then
'Cause l just want
to live my life and party
All l want is to be free
And rock my body
PEDRO: Okay
NICO: I've been
around the world
And l want to
live my life in Rio
'Cause l Rio,
'cause l Rio realize
What are you doing?
l don't know.
All right, Blu !
And fly!
I'm that samba, samba master
Master, master, master, master
Push out sound
from a ghetto blaster
Blaster, blaster,

That was meant for you.
Come on. Can we

This isn't your
fight, big-nose.
You mess with my friends,
you mess with me!
ALL: And us!
Yeah, little King Kong.
l don't know what's
going on here.
Birds versus monkeys!
Get them !
Yippee-kai-yay,
monkey man !
Yee-haw! Giddy-up!
Missed !
We got to go!
Need a lift?
Take that,
you funky monkey!
Thank you !
Anytime!
That's what
I知 talking about!
Man, we threw down !
Yeah, we threw down.
You guys were
like fire and ice.
Thunder and lightning !
Hip and hop!
Cheese and sprinkles!
Huh?
it痴 a Minnesota thing.
RAFAEL: You see?
Nothing you say
makes any sense.
Come on, follow me.
What?
But the birds were here.
Yeah, sure they were, kid.
l swear, the birds
were right here.
Well, how do you know?
Because
I知. . . I知 the one
who took them.
You !
l didn't want to hurt anybody,
l needed the money.
But Fernando,
l trusted you !
l know, but. . .
Man, that's good.
Hey, guys.
What are you doing here?
l just wanted to see
if you had any work for me.
Well, if you were
here two hours ago,
you could've helped
us load the. . . Ow!
What?
Shut up.
So, why are you guys
dressed for Carnaval?
So no one will notice us
when we smuggle these. . . Ow!
Shut up!
We made a float.
Oh ! A float!
So you guys are
going to the parade.
Can l come?
I知 a great dancer.
Can he come? Come on, please.
Three is better than two.
Fine. We got
to hurry though.
Whoa! l almost forgot.
Where did l put it?
l thought it was right here.
There it is.
Got it.
Let's go.
ARMANDO: Hurry up, kid.
TIPA: Can he ride on the
plane with us, too? Ow!
ARMANDO: Shut up!
No. We can't let them
get on that plane.
You can drive
a motorcycle, right?
You insult me.
No, l can't drive
a motorcycle.
it痴 just like riding
a snowmobile.
What happened?
Papa?
What happened?
Oh, no! Let me go.
Stop your chirping
and talk to me!
No, no. l don't know
anything. Help!
When l bite down
on your head,
will it go "pop,"
or will it go "crack"?
Where are the
cerulean birds?
That means blue,
by the way.
They escaped.
Went to Luiz.
Anything else?
They said you
were very nice.
Did they?
Liar.
And handsome, too.
Never send a monkey
to do a bird's job.
Psst!
Don't worry.
l got it.
There he goes.
That's my boy.
Is it hot?
l think I知 sweating.
l didn't even think
that was biologically
possible, and yet, look.
Wow.
Yeah, that's your
boy, all right.
Okay, so he needs
a little help.
Come on, let's
give him some.
Set the mood.
All right,
look, I知 on it.
l know how to set
the mood. Check it out.
Get a, Get a, Get a
Get a girl
Get, Get, Get
Get a girl
Take her,
take her to the floor
Show her,
show her how you roll
Drop it, drop it, drop it low
Drop it low,
drop-drop it low
What kind of mood is that?
Pedro, Pedro,
a little too aggressive.
I知 not hating
on your creativity,
but l think l got this one.
Follow my lead.
Now, that's more like it.
Wasn't really thinking
Wasn't looking
Wasn't searching
for an answer
In the moonlight
When l saw your face
Wow! What a
beautiful sunset.
Yeah.
RAFAEL: Psst! Blu.
Down here. Just tell her,
"You have beautiful eyes."
That's good.
Great idea.
l have beautiful eyes.
Yeah, okay.
Sure, they're nice.
No, her eyes. Her eyes.
Right, yeah. Your eyes,
your eyes are great, not mine.
l mean, mine are okay.
But yours, l bet
you can see right
through them.
RAFAEL: Blu !
Just tell her how you feel.
Jewel.
Yeah.
I致e been wanting
to tell you that l. . .
That l. . .
How sweet. You're
getting choked up.
Oh ! You're choking !
Okay! All right!
JEWEL: Come on, Blu,
move with me.
Stay with me, Blu.
One more, come on.
One more time!
Yep, that's my boy.
Ladies and gentlemen,
l give you Luiz's garage.
After you.
No, no, you first.
Please, l insist.
Okay.
Guess this is it.
Yeah. Quite an adventure.
End of the line.
Yes.
Guess things like this
don't happen in Tiny-soda.
Tiny-soda?
Wait, Minnesota.
Yeah.
That's very good.
That's very funny actually.
Luiz! Are you here,
Luiz? Hey, buddy!
l got some friends
l want you to meet.
Go!
BOTH:
Inside, outside,
inside, outside!
l got you's good.
What?
l could've ripped
your throats out,
but l didn't.
But l could've.
Hey, Luiz!
Stop scaring my friends.
Hey, Rafi, come here!
Where you've been?
You look good.
Wait. Luiz is a bulldog?
You got something
against dogs?
l do when they're
drooling on me.
it痴 a medical condition.
No, hey, amigo,
we really need you.
She's mean, bro.
Luiz, come on,
please, please.
We need your help.
Hmm.
l think l know what to do.
Are you sure
this is safe?
Sure. There's
nothing to it.
Now,
if something goes wrong,
scream really loud !
Because l can't
hear too good
with this thing on.
Hey, Rafi ! Get the
switch, please.
Don't worry.
He's a professional.
LUIZ: Now,
try not to move!
l can't really see out
of this thing, either!
Hey! Where did you go?
Eww!
Gross.
But I知 free.
Jewel ! Jewel ! We're free!
Slimy, but free.
Contaminated probably,
but free.
Can you believe
it's finally. . .
. . .over.
Yeah !
Come on, guys, let's go!
What are we
standing around for?
it痴 Carnaval !
Oh, yeah !
Yep.
l know just how you feel.
Watching them up there
makes you want to chase them
and grab them in your mouth
and bite their
heads off, huh?
I知 just kidding, bro.
Yeah, chasing them
is plenty.
JEWEL: I知 flying,
flying just like a bird!
PEDRO: Jewel,
but you are a bird !
Hey! Where you going?
Blu?
Blu, what's wrong?
Nothing.
Everything is perfect.
You'll be off
to the rainforest,
I値l be back with Linda,
just like we planned.
Hey, birds!
Stop yapping and
start flapping !
Let's go!
l guess,
l thought, maybe. . .
What? That you'd
come to Minnesota?
Great, l guess
I値l knit you a scarf.
No, that's not
what l meant.
Look, Jewel,
l can't spend my life
walking around following you
wherever you're going.
Hey, it's not my
fault you can't fly.
Awkward.
Okay, okay.
You know what?
This is good.
Just clear the air.
Just be completely honest
with each other.
You want honesty?
Fine, l can be honest.
l don't belong here.
In fact, l never
wanted to come here
in the first place.
And. . . And. . .
And you know what?
l hate samba.
Hey! That's
a little too far.
Make the mean bird
take it back.
Yeah, l said it.
Every song sounds
exactly the same.
Tico, taco, ya, ya, ya
Tico, taco, ya, ya, ya
I知 tico, taco out of here.
Fine!
See you around, pet!
No, wait, wait.
Come back!
You belong together!
You are Juliet to his Romeo!
Sure, they both
die in the end,
but you get my point!
Young love.
Always so melodramatic.
All right, boys,
go after her.
Blu ! Come back here.
Come on !
Yeah ! I知 ready
for Carnaval !
Who wants
to ride in my
fruit.
You left without me.
That's messed up.
Jewels! Jewels!
Wait up!
Going somewhere,
pretty bird?
Yeah. l was just on my way
to claw your eyes out!
Jewel !
Temper, temper.
Now come along, my dear.
We're going to a parade.
Everybody loves a parade.
Let go of me!
PEDRO: Hey! Get back here!
Ain't nobody messing
with a friend of Pedro,
l ain't having it!
it痴 on !
Did you see the
talons on that guy?
Talons?
Maybe it's on
next time.
Help!
Help! Little help!
Rafael, quit
following me.
You're going in
the wrong direction.
Isn't Carnaval that way?
I知 not going
to Carnaval.
No, I知 going home.
But l thought
you loved Carnaval.
l do. But l love
my family much more.
And that's a choice
l made with this.
Not with this.
NICO: Blu !
PEDRO: Hey, Blu ! Blu !
l was flying
and then l saw
this big cockatoo!
With big ninja talons!
This cockatoo was ugly!
Anyway, that's not the point.
And then Jewel was there,
and he snatched Jewel up.
Like, he snatched her up.
And then he was like,
"You're coming with me,
you little princess."
And Jewel was like,
"l ain't your princess,
leave me alone."
And l was like, "What?"
Then he was like, "What?"
Stop! Just tell me
what happened.
He got Jewel, man !
BOTH:
And he's taking her
to the parade.
This is all my fault.
Let's fly.
Carnaval, here we come!
Hey, dog,
I知 drowning back here!
You will get wet
on this ride!
Come on, come on, come on.
Where are these guys?
Whoa!

Okay, you can bring

Hey. Keep dancing, egg-boy.
One down and one to go.
You'll never find him.
He's already gone.
l don't need to find him.
He'll find you.
This is the spit!
Yeah, baby!
Now, l could
get my freak on !
Luiz, please!
Rescue first. Freak later.
Come on !
Out of my way, people!
RAFAEL: All right, guys!

You have to go. Nigel. . .
Hello, pretty bird.
