Let's go, let's go./
Got some real hoes waiting.
Oh, my God!
If I didn't want to lick your brother's face,
I'd kick his ass right now.
I'm so gonna kick the shit out of him.
Come on, Gina. Come on, Flaca.
What is wrong
with this chicken-poop piece of shit?
Gina, less talking. More pushing.
You could be dancing
with Papito Chulito, lady. Yo, come on!
-Shut up!
-Hey, what's up, girl,
-we gonna be dancing later?
-We're gonna be late.
Don't act like you didn't come here
on the bus.
I saw your ass coming on the bus, shit.
I'm so done with you, Pablo. it's over.
I just wanna remind you,
there's a two-drink minimum tonight.
And for those of you that are underage,
it's illegal,
so please do Cuko a favor
and don't get caught!
And remember to visit the showroom
in front of the club.
We've got products for everybody!
Acne Cure eliminates pimples in hours
instead of days.
Thank you!
These ladies, they are the hottest thing
to hit Chi-Town since the Chicago fire.
The All-Stars ain't got nothing
on these mamichulas.
And if I were them,
I'd be shaking in my panties
for the upcoming battle's grand prize!
So let's give it up
for the bootylicious Imported Delight!
Come on, let's go, step!
Girl, they ain't got nothing on you.
Gina, you always say that.
You see? They ain't even that good.
I kind of like that.
-I don't even need...
-What? What, girl? I will cut your face.
Gina, Gina,just...
Oh, man! Look at their footwork.
I'm on MySpace, girl.
I want everybody at practice tomorrow.
Okay, I'll be there, Loli. I'll be there.
Carmen, I thought we were
kicking it tomorrow.
Nobody's gonna beat my crew.
-So good.
-Get over it. They're nothing.
Ladies, where are you guys going?
-With you.
-Not sticking around?
I don't like this, come on.
-Girl...
-Gee, this is real cute.
I would hate to see you
with blood on your face,
-so keep it moving, real quick.
-I gotta go.
-I got a razor in my tongue and in my hair.
-I'll call you.
No, you won't. No, you won't.
The bitch doesn't talk, so, impossible.
-What are you doing here?
-I was looking for you, baby.
Gina, why don't we just chill for a little bit?
-We can go get some donuts later.
-We're going home, Carmen.
-My treat.
-I'm gonna call you later. I'll call you later.
-We're going home, come on.
-I know.
Hey, you wanna sleep over?
-I'll even let you take me shopping?
-Carmen, why don't you sleep over?
I'll call you tomorrow.
All right, close your books.
it's time for a pop quiz.
What kind of a pop quiz?
A what-the-hell pop quiz.
The psychology profile is something
for you to think about
as you begin to plan your future.
It's designed to help you pick a career
that, maybe later on in your life,
you might not regret.
Salgado.
Would you like to share your aspirations
with the class?
Not really.
Any interests? Any hobbies?
Does slumming count?
-Well, you're the pro.
-Enough.
Miss Salgado.
Hip-hop.
-Hip-hop?
-Forget it.
You wouldn't understand
unless you could dance.
Perhaps.
But right now,
I'm the one asking the questions.
And you're avoiding mine,
which was, "What are your aspirations?"
Hey, you dropped this.
That's not mine.
I know. it's mine.
-Why doesn't this...
-I wish he'd stop torturing us.
Forget about it, girl. Just be happy
that they don't have alive band in there
like Chucho's crazy-ass folks,
busting out sombreros and accordions.
They have accordions?
Yeah, dude, like, real-life accordions.
Like, the little one,
the three-year-old, will be rocking it.
I used to like your dad, now I don't.
Please, can you turn it down? It is so loud.
I disagree. Hey, drunk men.
Who smells like it? You.
-You like it?
-Yeah. I love the look in the cat's eyes.
Go and put it in the room, okay?
Hey, look, look, look. Watch.
-One, two, three. One, two, three.
-How are you doing?
No, don't talk to him.
He's upset his girlfriend broke up with him.
I broke up with her.
I love you so much.
I'm allergic to tomatoes.
Where are you going now?
I gotta go do homework.
And then I got practice. Gina!
-Gina.
-Coming.
Looks like you cleaned up for me,
how sweet.
You are such a good friend.
La Virgen, please forgive me for my sins,
'cause I am going to commit a hell
of a lot of them tonight.
-Hallelujah.
-Okay.
Yo, hurry up, dude.
Hold up,
I gotta do this stupid profile test for school
to figure out what I wanna be.
Shit, I already know what I wanna be.
-What are you gonna be?
-A Casa Del Pueblo employee.
Until they fire me.
And then what are you gonna do?
Probably end up at Elsa's Funeral Home.
What, until she fires you?
That was really hurtful.
I know what we can be.
We can be... Not strip dancers...
Private dancers!
Come into my world, baby boy.
I need a pole. Where's a pole?
Give me a pole. I need a pole.
Irene, do you have a broom?
She's on her ass right now.
Here you go.
-Will this work for you?
-You gotta hold it for me, okay?
'Cause you so lucky.
They'll love your ass. Sing with me.
And then we come, and we go
And we come and go, we do
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah
What's up? What's up?
What's up? What's up?
Girl, I have to finish this!
You're distracting.
You're lame.
Okay.
Dude, are you gonna finish that taco?
-Do you want it?
-Hell, yeah.
-Okay, you got it. One more time.
-Okay.
-Isn't this the best?
-Yeah.
The sky is your spotlight
and Chicago is your audience.
Pablo!
Hey.
Turn that up.
Get it, girl.
Get it.
Hey!
I hope you're ready for a test.
Dinner.
Sunday?
You're paying.
You're picking me up.
Nice pen.
Where you been, fool?
You're messing with my rhythm.
I need my change.
You see these crazy-ass folks acting
like I need to do something here.
-Can I get some help over here?
-What?
-Hi, Mrs. Lopez.
-This is bad.
-I almost cracked one of my teeth with this.
-I'm really sorry about that.
We have the unfrozen kind on sale.
And it's a bigger bag. Aisle seven.
What you gotta say?
I would love to hear what you...
I'm not gonna sell you nothing,
you gonna starve.
-What's wrong with you?
-I said, "Shut up."
Give me that. What you doing to me?
What the... Who buys this?
This is nasty.
I need you to work an extra shift.
Alberto called in sick.
But I got homework.
Where is my change, fool?
'Cause I just can't be eating
all this man's food.
-I got it.
-Okay.
Oh, my God. Hi, store manager.
One more time. One more time.
Hey, you're not focusing, okay?
Chest out.
Look out. There you go.
Out, chest out. There you go.
One more time.
Three and four.
Chest.
Two, three and four.
Good girl.
Open the book to page 367.
Can we keep it down in the peanut gallery?
There's a class going on.
Okay, gramps.
We're gonna talk about Skinner today.
Skinner believed
that positive behavior should be rewarded
and negative behavior
should always be ignored.
But I say
negative behavior should never be ignored.
For example...
-Hand it over.
-I ain't giving you jack.
-Then you're out of here.
-See, you can't throw me out.
-Really?
-I paid for this class.
And my money pays your salary.
So, you work for me.
Dude, get off me, fool.
-Get out of here.
-Don't touch me, man! Don't touch me!
You are out of here.
Don't touch me, man!
Now, does anybody else wannajoin him
out there?
Because there's plenty of room!
Miss Salgado and Miss Simpson,
may I see you both for a moment?
Can either of you explain this?
Well, I obviously don't know about her,
but I study with my private tutor.
You can ask him. I took notes.
Well, then you must be supernatural,
because your mortal ass hasn't been
in class enough to have any notes.
I'll explain what happened.
This bitch copied my test.
Lower your voice. Nobody here's deaf.
This lying bitch cheated.
-Miss Salgado. Miss Salgadoi
-I studied long and hard forthis test.
Seriously, could you handle this?
Otherwise, I'm gonna have to call my lawyer
and file for harassment.
And as far as her accusing me
of copying off of her?
I'm sorry, no. I don't have to do that.
You know you copied my test
because your prissy ass was too lazy
to study.
Prissy is better than poor.
Well, poor is better than puta.
Who taught you how to speak, trash?
Shut up and crawl back under that rock
that you came from.
That's enough!
Both of you know the material so well?
You will take a make-up exam right now.
Why do I have to take another exam
if I didn't do anything wrong?
Consider this your chance
to prove your innocence.
I ain't doing shit.
Listen, you take the exam right now,
or you fail.
End of discussion.
-Whatever. I'll take it.
-No.
This is bullshit.
I'm gonna tell you what bullshit is.
Your attitude.
You think that you can scare me
with some bad-ass-from-the-hood drama?
Are you kidding me?
What does it matter, anyway?
That's right.
So don't even bother, homegirl.
I mean, you know you're gonna end up
working for me someday anyways, right?
Richard, the other student
instigated the situation.
Frank, she practically knocked
her unconscious.
I can't change the rules for that.
I got a board to answer to.
-She's off two weeks.
-Come on.
-Richard...
-Well, she'll be reinstated
when she's served her suspension.
As long as she keeps up with the work,
if you know what I mean.
Frank, please, don't take it personally.
You know, this whole tenure thing.
Well, word in the right ear.
Six, seven, eight...
Just like that.
How you doing?
Keeping up with your assignments?
Why do you care?
The other day I saw you dancing in the park.
What if I told you there was a college
in California you may be interested in?
It's a reputable school.
It offers academic scholarships.
It even has a fine school of dance.
From what I understand,
many of the students
go on to become professional dancers,
if that would interest you.
Carmen, you have talent.
I'll even write a letter of recommendation
for you.
Okay, you know what? Go ahead.
Do your thing and piss your life away.
Why are you working so hard
if you don't wanna be someone?
Take it.
I dare you.
MUa, how's school?
It's good. Fine.
You're a good student.
No, no, no, no. Pops, come on.
"Student," okay?
-Shut up, dude.
-Leave her alone.
-Shut up.
-Hey!
-What's your deal?
-No hats at the dinner table.
What about you, mUo? How's work?
Busy, Pops. We're working
on some dope-ass homes up in Lake Forest.
Nla, they're as big as our zip code,
and I'm making bank.
Bank!
Well if you're making bank,
why don't you go back to school then?
Hey, as far as I can count,
I'm making a lot more moolathan you,
-so don't be giving me advice.
-Whatever.
Hey, why don't you pay some
of the bills then?
Hey, at least I got wheels, bro.
Shoot! I'm gonna start charging for gas, too.
It costs big chavos, Nla,
to transport heavy load.
I know you are not talking about me.
I will kick you in your...
No! Get away! I just pushed your ass from
Western to Kinzie and I see you don't even...
My wrist hurts
from holding that broken mirror all the time.
You know what? You're all wagging.
You two better shut up
or you'll be hitchhiking with esa loser.
Whatever!
-Esa loser
-Ese loser
-Come on, Mom.
-Ese loser. Pop it up, pop it up.
MUa, can you help me
in the kitchen tonight?
I have to prepare the food for the church.
Mom, I gotta meet the dancers
at the club tonight.
Maybe some other time.
Is that all you think about?
How are you gonna make a good wife
when you don't know how
to take care of your home?
I don't wanna be a wife like that, Mom.
Mom, I'm really sorry,
I didn't mean it like that.
Why don't you take your punk ass
back to school
-and learn some goddamn manners?
-Why don't you shut up?
Yeah? You think you're gonna
go somewhere,
shaking your little skinny ass
on a raggedy stage
in front of hoochies and thugs
who can't even spell their own name?
Hey, who made you Professor Escalante?
As far as I remember, you dropped out.
-Yeah.
-Why don't you shut your damn mouth?
I know what I'm talking about, all right?
I've done what you've done,
and I've been there before,
and you go nowhere.
You stay in school
and you get a good education.
And you shut your damn mouth,
you sloppy-ass loser...
-Why don't you make me?
-Look at you.
You're a disgrace, man. Grow up.
You think you're gonna be a little goofball
and all that shit?
-Who do you think you are, man?
-What you gonna do, get in my face now?
-Yeah, yeah, come on.
-Get on up, you sloppy mouth over here.
Little kid, little baby over here,
talking about your car.
-Yeah, yeah. Get up, Gina! Yeah!
-We'll do it right now!
That's what you do!
You wanna do something...
I swear to God!
Okay.
-Is that what you gonna do?
-Yeah!
-Come on! Come on!
-Seriously?
-Come on! Come on!
-Do it! Swing!
-Come on! Get in my face then, huh?
-You stop that! I'm sick of your shit!
Three and four and five.
-Let's go!
-Get out of my face!
-Go! Swing it!
-Don't spit on me!
Shut up!
All-Stars have the big battle next month!
Tonight they're gonna show us
what they've got.
That's my girl!
-Go, Gina Gi.
-You got me.
Carmen!
You got it, girl!
Stop hanging on my man.
Why you always making me look bad?
I'm sorry. I don't know what happened.
-I just messed up, Loli, and I'm so sorry.
-I can't count on anybody.
-I'm sorry.
-Just focus on your feet
doing what they're supposed to.
I'll see you at practice tomorrow.
-Where's Gina? You seen Gina?
-Shit!
Pablito, seen Gina?
No, man.
Let me ask you something.
You like my girl?
-What?
-Do you like my girl?
-No, man.
-Keep it that way.
When you see Gina,
you tell her I was looking for her, all right?
There's a three-drink minimum.
I don't see 15 beers here.
You're my boy, Pablito. I owe you one.
Hey, Jesse.
Aren't you gonna do your shit
for us tonight?
I don't know.
What, you're too good for us now?
No, man. I just wanna go home
and do my shit in the toilet.
-Carmen, you ready?
-Yeah.
-I gotta go.
-Come on, stay, stay, girl.
You just got here.
Come here. Gina!
Come on, let's go. You're late.
Five, six... Jump in.
-Hey, girl.
-Hey.
Where you been? I've been waiting for you.
You have?
Why, what's the matter?
I have a math quiz on Friday,
and I'm not sure about some questions.
-Really? Math, huh?
-Yeah.
Wait. Don't you have homework?
No, I already did my homework.
All right, mama, have a good night, okay?
Bye.
Where are you going? You just got home.
I'm going out.
Enough dancing, hUa.
Be home early.
Bye.
What you got, girl?
Loli, you go, girl. You got this.
Loli! Loli! Loli!
No, she didn't.
All right. Hold this.
Do it! Work it, work it! Work your magic, girl.
Shake it!
Hi.
Hey.
You came.
Where am I?
This is my best friend, Gina.
Hi, Gina, best friend.
Hello.
-Hi.
-Hi.
Come on. I hope you're hungry.
Hungry? Are you hungry?
What about these?
No.
All right.
So, we're not eating here, are we?
No, but I'm paying, remember?
And I get an employee discount.
What about these?
You know, I think I had those yesterday.
Great.
Great.
-Smell this.
-What is it?
It's a Mexican vegetable.
So, what do you want for dessert?
You know, you better pick,
because I don't recognize anything.
That's funny.
You're serious.
Hello.
So, Jared.
Tell me, where do you live?
Evanston.
Fancy!
Did you get my discount?
I got your discount, girl, and I got mine.
it's two for one tonight.
So you need to put some meat
on those bones.
Because I know
how you white boys like them, okay?
-You saw that? Okay.
-I'll get you tomorrow.
You better.
-Bye, Gina.
-Wait.
Take me with you, yeah?
Love you. Call you later.
I hate this place.
What is it?
It's a big, fat potato chip.
Take a bite.
Come on.
I'll tell you what. I'll take a bite,
but if something happens to me,
-it's completely your fault.
-Fair enough.
Are you okay?
-Oh, my God.
-Yeah. Actually, it's not that bad.
See? Told you.
As long as we don't know what it is.
I told my mom to stop telling me
'cause this one time, she told me
I ate french fries, and they were worms!
Why?
Latin people, we eat everything.
Cow intestines or...
No, I think pig intestines. Cow tongue.
Bull's balls.
Chicken feet.
Beef brains.
-Eyeballs!
-Hey, don't worry about me
'cause that one was real.
Sorry.
So, do you come here a lot?
Yeah.
Yeah, I really do, actually.
-Dance with me!
-You don't want me to do that.
-Why not?
-Because I'll probably kill you.
Shut up. Come on.
It's really easy, okay?
So, you're gonna walk forward
with this foot.
-And then, step back with that foot.
-Okay.
And then, one, two, three.
I am so sorry! Are you okay?
It's fine. Totally fine.
-I am such a clutz.
-it's okay. I'll just wear boots next time.
Just kidding.
Okay, ready?
You know what part I do know?
Wow!
Bookworm.
Stop it. Stop it!
-Quit it!
-I will not quit it.
That's it. Come on!
You are so going down!
-Am I?
-Yes. Yes, you are.
No!
Okay, okay. He's here.
I'll call you later, I promise. Bye.
-Hey.
-Hi.
I hope you're hungry,
because I totally blew off practice today.
Come on, come on, please.
Gina, take out the trash.
You're so beautiful.
So, Carmen, it's great to finally meet you.
Jared's been keeping you quite a secret.
Tell us about yourself.
Dad, she's not one of your clients.
I should hope not.
I sell medical devices, call on physicians.
By the way, what a beautiful name you have.
Carmen. How original.
Are your parents big opera fans?
Is that what gave them the idea?
No. They named me after the saint,
Maria del Carmen.
I have five cousins, two friends, an aunt
and a neighbor's dog with the same name.
-A dog?
-Oh, my.
So, Carmen is an awesome dancer.
She's been showing me
some new dance steps,
-among other moves.
-Really?
Did Jared tell you that I used to be a dancer?
Well, that was a long time ago.
-You can dance for me any time.
-Honey, behave!
I'm so sorry.
So, Carmen,
what type of dance do you do?
-Hip-hop.
-Hip-hop?
Ls that like the old bebop from the '50s,
with just a little bit of cha-cha-cha?
Wonderful!
How are your lessons coming, Son?
Great. Yeah, I think I'm almost ready
for my public debut.
Now, Carmen, tell me,
where do you do your dance?
Logan Square.
Logan Square?
Jay.
People get mugged down there.
People get mugged everywhere, Mother.
Still! Honey, it's not safe.
She's right on this one, Son.
If you're gonna take over
the family business, I need you in one piece.
Sweetie, you know how my anxiety disorder
takes on just at a drop of a hat.
-Do you need a pill?
-Just the other half.
Don't upset your mother, Son.
-For goodness's sake...
-All right!
It's just, I feel like I'm living
in The Truman Show here.
If Logan Square is good enough for Carmen,
then it's good enough for me.
Fine, dear.
So, Carmen,
would you happen to live
in a gated community? Please say, "Yes."
Yeah, sort of.
We have bars on our windows and doors.
How resourceful.
-Hey, girl.
-Hey.
-Hi, Pa.
-Hey, mUa.
How's school?
It was good. Had a test today, it was easy.
This came for you.
You opened my mail?
You had no right!
And you have a right to lie to me
and your mother?
Did you hurt someone?
I asked you, did you hurt someone?
You don't understand, okay?
I had to defend myself.
She was accusing me of cheating!
Is this the way we teach you
to defend yourself?
You defend yourself
by getting a good education.
-How would you know?
-Watch your mouth.
You never win by using your hands.
Dad, I can take care of myself, okay?
Like this?
What kind ofjob are you going to get
if you're always in trouble?
I don't know.
Anything's better than what you do.
I'm gonna stick up for myself.
You're a coward.
You let people step on you, and that's why
you're still picking up garbage.
What are you saying, little puta bitch?
You think you're the shit?
You're no better than garbage.
Shut up and mind your own business.
You're talking to my parents
like some kind of alley rat.
That's my business!
Punk.
I'm a punk? Well, then, you're a loser.
You're 26 years old, and you're still living
with Mom and Dad. That's pathetic!
-You're a loser!
-Calling me a loser?
-Leave her alone!
-Get out of the way!
-Pablojust lunged.
-Get out of here. Oh, my God!
I'm so upset I missed it.
I wish I had a front-row seat. Who won?
I don't know.
I'm proud of you. You got balls, girl.
Sometimes you just gotta fight
for your right to party.
They said it best.
Freedom! Freedom!
Don't worry about her, dude,
don't even worry about her.
She'll be out by midnight, anyway.
You know what I'm saying?
And that's when the fun starts!
We'll party, get ready.
Practice for when we get our own place.
A loft in the skies.
It'll be great.
And we'll get a little dog named Chip,
and we'll call him Chipito.
-Yeah?
-Yeah!
And throw parties,
and have flowers and all that pretty stuff.
Okay.
Maybe I should've done this a long time ago.
Come over here.
I love you now. Yes. I'm making you food.
Look at this. 63 cents at Casa del Pueblo.
Discount, 19 cents.
This expired, April '05.
No, dude, it's best before April '05.
Doesn't mean it's not good after.
So, you can see Cuko's
got the hookup. Right.
From Cali, the one and the only,
Beat Freaks!
Break it down! Break it down! Break it down!
Hit it!
That was sick.
Damn it!
You're back.
You're leaving Chavez?
Did you get your application in?
Just go.
You are senile!
You are completely out of control!
Oh, my God!
I pay for everything.
We don't need to talk about allowances, Nla!
-She pays rent or gets out!
-You know what...
-You pay rent or get out.
-You, too.
-Do not disrespect her!
-You, too.
-Get away.
-Should just leave your ass!
Hey, girl! Okay, you found that.
Well, see, the situation is, like,
you know I get heart palpitations
and I need Irene's menudo in my mouth.
So... Hello! Hello?
Wow, look at that. That's where they are.
I've been looking for these.
I was looking for the rest of my menudo.
Can you believe somebody ate it?
-Crazy business.
-Who could it be?
Who would ever? it's obnoxious.
We gotta go to Irene's.
I wanna get some more taquitos.
I need some taquitos in my life.
With a Pablito on the side.
No, stop it right now. I don't hear you.
I'm so hungry. Oh, my God!
-Can't you just give me one more spoonful?
-I'm so hungry too
so let's go get something to eat.
Down. So down.
But I'm just gonna change real quick
because somebody didn't do the laundry
like I paid her to do!
I'm totally rocking these pajama pants
because they know me.
Oh, my God.
-What?
-Gina!
-Okay, Carmen, don't go there, all right?
-Don't go there?
-It ain't nothing!
-What?
You remember when I got into that fight
with that hoochie shorty?
I swear to God, she just jumped me,
all guerilla-style.
Next time I see her,
I'm gonna totally cut her face.
You do not deserve this.
-Carmen, please. All right?
-No!
-Listen...
-No, this is bullshit!
Nine's coming around, okay?
He's treating me
just like your boyfriend is, okay?
Look, he even got me this.
Sexy lingerie.
Trust me, girl.
No. No, I do not trust you.
What if this was happening to me?
But it's not happening to you.
It doesn't happen to you.
It's happening to me.
And I can handle it, okay?
So just let me take care of my shit.
Cool?
But I'm totally losing weight right now.
Come on, we gotta go!
I need to get some food in...
Carmen, we gotta feed my booty.
Feed, feed, my booty
Feed...
You never change.
Always taking the job with you.
Marina.
Sit down, please.
-You know, it's really good to see you.
-You, too.
I was really surprised to hear from you.
Yeah.
How's the advertising business?
It's good.
Closing up a big account this week.
-Where have I heard that before?
-I know.
So, did you ever settle down?
Have any kids?
That would be a no and a no.
it's too much overhead.
I was wondering
about the market these days.
Any potential openings coming up?
Why do you ask?
I was thinking I could use a change
of scenery.
I thought you wanted to teach.
You know, be around youthful energy
and women who would be attentive
to your every need.
Marina, I was wondering
if you would take this back,
in case something opens up.
You know what, Frank?
I don't think it's a good idea.
Why? You don't think I can hack it anymore?
Yeah. Times have changed.
Wow.
Times have changed.
I should go.
You take care, Frank.
Okay, for those of you that don't know me,
my name is Cuko.
Welcome to my kingdom!
Okay, okay. Tonight is the night
we've all been waiting for!
The grand battle of Armageddon
between the All-Stars
and Imported Delight!
We're gonna have hot, sweaty bodies,
moving, shaking and grooving!
Let's get the party started! DJ, kick it!
Thank you.
What you got, Loli?
Get her, Loli!
Come on!
All-Stars! All-Stars! All-Stars! All-Stars!
All-Stars! All-Stars! All-Stars! All-Stars!
All-Stars! All-Stars! All-Stars! All-Stars!
All-Stars! All-Stars! All-Stars!
Can I walk you up?
No, thanks. I'm just gonna go to sleep.
Can you pick me up from work tomorrow?
Sure.
Hey, my parents are going out of town
in a few weeks,
and, I don't know, I was thinking maybe
we can use your employee discount,
have a few people over?
Sure.
Is everything okay?
I'll see you tomorrow, okay?
Who's there?
-Hey! What up, girl?
-Hey, Carmen.
Come join the party, baby.
Papi, don't stay stuff like that. Come on.
Carmen! Carmen!
Papi, come on.
Excuse me, beautiful.
You must be Carmen.
I've heard a lot about you
from your girl, Gina.
I'm Juan. What's up?
Give me another hit, papi.
-I don't want it like that!
-Just lick it off!
-I don't want it like that!
-Shut up! Just lick it off!
Hey, how about we...
Look. I'm kind of bored.
Nine's busy doing his thing,
and I ain't trying to get in the way.
You know what I'm saying?
How about you and me hanging out?
Maybe getting buzzed together?
I don't do that shit.
Neither do I.
I just thought you might,
you know, 'cause you're her friend.
We could do something else.
-Maybe, we can go back to...
-Don't touch me.
-Why you gotta disrespect?
-Let go of me, you piece of shit! Gina!
Gina, get this dog off of me!
-Gina, get this dog off...
-I'll give it to you like you never had before!
Crazy bitch!
-Gina...
-Bro, give her something to relax.
-Carmen, are you okay?
-Sit your fat ass down!
-Papi, come on.
-Hey, don't call her a fat ass!
Get the hell out of here.
-Carmen, what you gonna do, Carmen?
-What are you gonna do?
You gonna hit me like you do Gina?
Go ahead.
-I'm not scared of you!
-Have you been talking shit?
-I am not scared of you! Let go of her!
-I haven't been saying anything.
I said, "Let go of her!" No? Don't touch you?
Papi, I'm so sorry about that, I am so sorry!
I'm gonna straighten her out, okay?
Relax, relax. I'm gonna take care of it.
Get off!
What are you gonna do now, Nino?
You gonna hit me? Hit me!
-Hit me, you piece of shit!
-Let's get out of here.
-Keep talking, Carmen.
-Yeah, I will!
-I'm not scared of you, okay?
-Carmen...
Papi, please.
-I am not scared of you.
-Please. Carmen!
-Get the hell out of here.
-I'm gonna see you two bitches later.
Gina, I want this shit picked up
by the time I get back.
-You got me?
-Okay, Papi. All right!
-Carmen, I will see you later.
-Get out.
-Stop it, please.
-See both of you later.
Piece of shit.
Girl, what the hell's up with you tonight?
Come on.
What are you doing?
Carmen, please, not now. All right?
Well, then when?
When you're in the emergency room?
Is that when I should start?
You are acting like a total idiot.
That's right, because I forgot.
You're all high and mighty now
because you got a rich, white boyfriend!
What? Gina...
Nino loves me, okay?
Gina, listen to me. Listen to me!
Nino does not love you!
This is not love!
-You think your man loves you?
-Yeah.
Why do you think he's with you, hoochie?
Because you jump when he calls.
-Gina...
-You're just a stupid-ass bitch, just like me!
-Stop it!
-Just stop acting like you're any better.
-I said just stop it.
-'Cause once he gets bored,
-he's gonna go on to the next pussy!
-Stop it, okay?
-'Cause you ain't nobody!
-Shut up!
Shut up!
You ain't nobody!
I ain't taking your crazy life anymore!
Carmen. Carmen, I'm sorry, all right?
I messed up, all right? I wasjustjoking.
Flaca, where are you going?
You're all I've got.
Baby, come on.
Make out with me, baby.
-Wake up.
-All right, baby.
Baby.
Hey.
-You've been talking shit?
-No, baby. I would never...
Baby, please! That's sore, please.
Please, please.
-You've been talking shit?
-No, baby. I didn't say anything.
-You've been talking shit?
-No, baby, I would never say anything bad.
-Baby...
-What'd you say to her?
-Baby!
-What did you say to that bitch?
I didn't... I didn't say...
-What'd you say to that bitch?
-I can't...
I can't breathe! What the hell!
-What did you say to her?
-I said that I love you. I love you.
How does that feel?
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I tried to talk...
I'm sorry. I'm sorry!
-I'm sorry!
-Tell me how it... Just shut the...
Tell me how it feels.
Tell me, would you?
Tell me how this feels, Gina!
Tell me how that feels!
Gina, please talk to me.
Gina? Gina, Gina, please wake up.
Please wake up, baby. Please wake up.
Please wake up, baby.
I'm sorry.
Why don't you wake up?
Baby, wake up. God, what's happening?
On, God.
She loved you.
She knows that you loved her.
She does, hUa.
It's not your fault, mi amor.
it's gonna be all right.
It's gonna be all right.
You know that dance school
you told me about?
-Any news?
-Yeah, they want me to audition.
Congratulations.
I wanted to thank you, but I'm not going.
I don't understand.
I just can't waste any more time on it.
Waste your time?
Is that what this has been?
Look, I got problems
that you don't know about, okay?
-So do I.
-it's not that easy.
You know what's not easy? This.
Every time I hear your excuses.
You just wanna stay where you are
so you can complain for the rest of your life,
"There's not enough of opportunities
in the world."
You wouldn't know an opportunity
if it landed right in front of your face!
Who the hell do you think you are,
judging people by your own rules?
You don't know me.
You don't know my family, okay?
You don't even know yourself.
You are such a snob.
You don't give a shit about your students.
And that's why you're leaving,
because you're the quitter.
I didn't quit!
You think you're the only one
with problems? Think again.
You haven't seen anything yet.
Nobody cares about your problems.
Nobody cares about anything
except what you could do for them!
I'm sorry.
There's a part of me that wants to tell you,
"You're right. It doesn't matter."
But I can't, in my good conscience.
I don't know why I believe in you
when I don't even know you.
You see, it has nothing to do
with me believing in you,
and everything to do
with you believing in you.
Take it from me,
running is a hard habit to break.
Got a surprise for you.
It's your favorite.
I'm sorry about Gina.
Wish there was something I could do.
You have to move on for her.
She would want that.
I know.
I was thinking of auditioning
for a dance school in California.
California.
Wow.
But I changed my mind after everything.
You know, I have some news
that might cheer you up.
After this semester,
I'm gonna work for my dad,
get my own place.
Really?
Yeah, yeah.
I figure it's about time I live alone.
No, I mean about working for your dad.
Sure, yeah. I mean,
I'd never have to worry about getting fired.
Or 401 retirement.
I mean, my friends would kill for this job.
I'd be an idiot not to take it.
And plus, the place I'm getting,
I think there's room for two.
Wow, that's serious.
But, aren't we serious?
I mean, we spend all
of our time together anyway.
The only thing that would change is
we'd be under the same roof.
I don't know.
I just haven't danced, you know?
I love you.
Say something.
I gotta go.
I gotta go.
Enjoy your...
Hey, that's Somaya. Hey, Somaya!
-Hey, Somaya! Wait up!
-Pablo.
Pablo, come on. Let's go.
It'll only take a couple minutes.
I'll be right back.
-No, it won't...
-Somaya, hold up!
-Somaya!
-Pablo. Fine, I'm driving your car.
How've you been? So, I was thinking,
maybe we get together later?
-I could show you...
-Yeah?
-I got some tunes. I got some...
-You do?
Yeah, yeah, I can spin at you.
You heard me, right?
Oh, yeah, you saw me, right?
-Excuse me.
-You don't need to mess with this guy.
I got the... He come back later.
-Come on, lady.
-Sure you don't wanna come?
I'll take you, too.
-I got a full tank of gas.
-Pablo!
Damn it.
Pablo.
Pablo!
Pablo!
Hey, girl. How's it going tonight?
Damn, look at my hair already.
You got any gel on you?
That's my song, right there.
Hey, you gonna come back to practice?
Just because you suck sometimes
doesn't mean you suck.
Next battle, $1,500.
We got it hooked up.
Damn, this stuff is so sticky.
Get it all over the place.
That's my song.
Still got your boyfriend?
Things going all right?
Yeah.
You better hang on to him.
Loli, let's go!
I just wanna be a little kid again.
I want Gina back,
and I want us to be kids again.
I remember like it was yesterday.
Yeah.
I want yesterday back.
I just don't know who I'm supposed
to be anymore, you know?
I'm going crazy, Pa.
Heaven knows, I regret so much.
You know, the first time I ever walked
into a school
was to sign your brother, Jesse,
up for kindergarten.
I couldn't even read
those forms really good.
I came to this country with no money.
No English.
I joined the army to become a citizen.
I hurt people, too.
That's why I know you can never win
by using your hands.
But it's not like that for you.
You have an education.
You...
MUa, I don't know how to speak,
but one thing I learned is
you always have more strength
than you think.
He makes sure of that.
You can do it.
Pa.
I love you.
Are you crazy? it's raining.
I didn't see you over there.
I was enjoying it.
Are you feeling okay?
You're the one in the rain.
I'm feeling pretty good these days.
Partly due to you.
What did I do now?
Well, you taught me a great lesson.
Like what?
Second chances don't discriminate.
You know,
I feel like this isn't just about me anymore.
Good luck on yourjourney.
Same to you.
Did you get struck
by Latin lightning or something?
What the hell.
I don't believe it.
-it's pretty wild.
-Yeah, it's pretty good.
Hey, girl.
I broke up with Jared.
Yeah.
It was tough,
but gotta do what you gotta do, right?
My dance routine is looking really good.
I think you're gonna love the ending.
I miss yo u.
Look, Carm, I made it for you. You like it?
Oh, my God. I love it.
And so does the boogeyman!
I'm the tickling monster!
Are you still convinced you're not ticklish?
I don't think so, buddy. I don't think so.
I have something for you.
You made this for me?
For your dream.
Thank you.
Okay.
Miss Carmen Salgado?
Carmen, you take forever,
we're gonna be late.
Hey, now don't be nervous, okay?
Remember everything we did.
Remember?
Remember that one move I showed you?
You can start with the heartbeat.
Remember, answer the phone?
Pick up the phone. Answer the phone.
Who is it? Who is it?
No, can't talk right now.
Remember? You want me to show you
the Superman again?
It's like...
Now, don't get nervous.
You look like you're nervous.
It says here you don't have
a dancing background.
No.
We gonna get this one, girl.
We gonna get this.
You're gonna move to LA.
You're gonna have a life.
You're not gonna be like Jesse and me.
You know, he's all, whatever.
And you can get out of here.
Remember what Mom always said.
"Go for it!"
This is a rigorous program
that only admits exceptionally trained talent.
Do you honestly believe
you meet the criteria?
Stay focused, stay focused.
You wanna go over anything?
You want me to show you
the heartbeat again?
The puppets?
This is your time, girl. This is your time.
You go out there
and do this for the Salgado family, shoot.
Don't make me get out there
and show them what's up.
Just stay focused.
Okay, just think good thoughts.
Remember we used to play in the park?
It was me, you and Gina.
Just think about those days.
