This is the story
of 2 girls- Anju and Manju,...
..who were born in this palatial
mansion but never enjoyed it.
When Manju was 6 months old,
her maid kidnapped her.
It is rumoured that
the maid was mentally unstable.
- Master! Master! -The owners
took this loss to heart...
... and called Tribhuvan
from the village...
... to look after the property.
As soon as Tribhuvan arrived...
... plots started
floating around the mansion...
...cause he wanted his brother's
immeasurable wealth for himself.
When Anju was ten...
... her parents died
in a car accident.
But people say that accident
had been caused to happen.
But nothing was proved. After
Tribhuvan's wife's death...
... his sister-in-law,
Amba came to leave his son.
Amba came but never went back.
It's said that Tribhuvan
and Amba had an affair.
One day Tribhuvan
tried to kill Anju too.
But the cunning Amba stopped him.
As the property would
then have gone to the trust.
Tribhuvan swallowed his anger...
... and poor Anju
had to pay the price.
No! I don't want it.

PRESENT :
CHAALBAAZ
- Why are you late? - Today is
her parents' death anniversary...
... so she was shedding tears.
Today is my brother and
his wife's death anniversary...
... and no-one told me!
This is disloyalty that the
brother who looked after me...
... I forgot
his death anniversary!
I' m not worthy of pardon. I
should be punished for my crime.
- Anju, what's my punishment?
- What are you saying, Uncle?
I... was crying
because of my helplessness...
Who made you helpless?
Did you, Amba?
How could I dare do that?
I' m a guest in this house.
Anju is the
mistress of this house.
Yes, her
wish will come true now.
Anju, what do you want?
Tell me, my child.
I' ll offer flowers worth Rs.5/-
to the temple in their name.
Only worth Rs.5? For my
honourable brother and his wife?
Absolutely not! Buy all
the flowers from all the shops.
her parents, will distribute...
... clothes and
sweets to poor children.
- Really? - Yes, child.
- But the money?
Don't you dare talk of money.
Here dear, keep this money.
- Distribute it. - No.
- Take it, my dear.
You must be crazy
to think I'd give you money.
One only sheds tears for the
dead. Come on, to the bank.
Come on and no excuses at the
bank. I' m fed up of your tears.
Keep this. Go.
- Miss Anju, here's your money.
- Give it to me.
Times are bad these days.
Carrying money
is quite dangerous.
We' re in a hurry.
We take leave.
What's the hurry?
- Have a cup of tea.
- Today is my brother's death...
...anniversary. Anju has to dole
out clothes & sweets to the poor.
We have lots of work.
So we must take leave.
- You' re forgetting something.
- No, I've taken the money.
- Anju has forgotting to sign.
- Oh!
Take.
Cap!
Sign.
- Who gave this money?
- To buy flowers, Dadu gave it.
Dayal, come here.
Dayal take off my shoes.
Your fingers have grown
old serving this family, Dayal.
I' m proud of this fact, master.
Who does this much to
earn one's livelihood?
I' m slave to
your command, master.
Why did you give Anju
money against my wishes?
- Want money?
- Don't beat Dadu.
Want to
celebrate their anniversary?
- Only five rupees. - What?
- He only gave me five rupees.
How dare you speak back!
It's very important for you
to obey me Dayal. - Yes sir.
Hold this! Hold. Hold it.
Celebrate their
anniversary go on!
Have you gone mad? If she dies
we' ll be on the road. - But...
Can't you wait?
Spoiling matters.
Still standing here!
Go do your work
It's only a little blood!
Sister, if something happens
to you, what' ll I do?
Yes Raju, I have to
live. For you, I must.
I have nobody else but you!
All this should be clean by the
time we return, understand?
Or l' ll make you wash
the floor with your tears.
She's putting on weight!
Cut out one meal from her diet.
Everything should be clean,
understand...
Stop crying and smile for me.
Please sister.
Okay whom shall I imitate?
Shall I mimic Papa?
She's put on weight,
Cut out one meal from her diet.
Sis, I want to get married.
Strange, you' re not at all
interested in my personal life.
Friend, sis doesn't want
to hear, so l' ll tell you.
If I get married,
she' ll get some respite.
I've seen a girl also.
She studies in my class.
She's unmarried so far. She
helped me with my spellings once.
But her nose is always running!
She' ll bring lots of
chocolates in her dowry.
I would've refused but its a
matter of all those chocolates.
- Sis, talk to her folks.
- Crazy guy, stop it!
I haven't seen
you dance for ages.
No.
You know what' ll happen
if they catch me dancing.
Your face glows with
happiness when you dance.
No.
- We did hear some music here.
- Even I heard it.
- Yes, sir.
- Who was dancing here?
Dancing? God knows.
Anju was cleaning this place.
Raju must the playing somewhere
and at my age, I can't dance.
- Answer to the point, go.
- Alright.
I've called important
people for my birthday.
Keep an eye on Anju.
You've said it
and Amba has heard it.
- You relax. - Aren't you
forgetting something?
- What?
- Nothing.
Oh! Many happy
returns of the day.
By the way,
how old one you today?
Have I ever asked you your age?
Happy birthday. So how many
winters have you seen go by?
- l' m a little boy still.
- Where's Anju? I don't see her.
She must be busy.
I keep telling her there's
no need for her to work.
But she loves to
do everything herself.
- And where's Suraj?
- I don't understand him at all.
All kids return home by 10 but
his night begins only after 10.
Have you planned for some
dance or its just cake and out?
Wait a minute and watch,
Mr.Vishwanath.
Friends, thank you for
joining me in my joy.
You've always abused
me for my miserliness.
But today your abuses will be
drowned by applause. Clap!
Anju, what' re you doing
here alone. Come, join in, come.
How dare she slap
you before other's Tribhuvan!
You must take charge or
things will go out of hand.
I won't spare her,my whip hasn't
tasted her blood for some time.
Dance! Let me see
how much you' ll dance today.
Today l' ll make you dance
to your hearts content.
No! Don't beat me.
Get up!
Beat me!
Yopu will beat me?
Dance! You love to dance!
I' ll show you such a dance that
you' ll forget your own dance.
You've danced to music, now
dance to the tune of my whip.
If I let go of you,
you' ll fall and become lame.
And you won't be able to
dance anymore! Shall I let go?
- No.
- No, okay I won't let you fall.
Got hurt? Broke your leg?
Now we' ll make dear Anju stand &
check whether her leg is broken.
It hasn't broken. Then
now it' ll break!
You' ll hit me!
On my birthday!
You will humiliate me in
everyone's presence?
Master! Stop it! Have mercy!
Forgive Anju, sir!
She' ll never dance.
Explain to, her that if she ever
dances again,...
... she wont have feet left!
She won't dance again.
Get up child.
Get me poison, Dadu.
I want to die, Dadu.
Why doesn't death come to me?
I cannot take this anymore.
Have patience child
and trust in God.
Remember my child.
Whoever gave that whip in
Tribhuvan's hand, also gave...
... somebody else the
power to snatch it from him.
Manju is my name, what?
- Sorry, Manju bai.
- Me, bai, a courtesan.
You called me a super stage
artiste, a courtesan?
I didn't, my boss did.
Will you pay me or not.
I danced and performed
a whole show for you.
Didn't you tell her what I said?
What did he say?
He said you should come for
dinner to claim your money.
Take care of this girl.
Brother, you?
I...I was simply joking!
Doesn't matter, l' ll take
my money later. Bye, Tata.
Jaggu, things are
beyond my control now.
I won't get involved
in your problems.
Sir, you banged into my car.
Please pay up for the damage.
You want money, here take this.
Jaggu, sir.
I was just paying up.
Take it. Rs 60/- for taxi damage.
You keep the rest.
He dented my cab.
- What?
- Dirty, dirty, chhee!
You speak as if it's yours.
Come on, put down the meter.
- This cab is booked.
- l' ll pay the full fare.
- You' ll pay?
- Look, don't act smart.
There are plenty of cabs in town.
Then go with somebody else.
If I go elsewhere,
what' ll happen to your meter?
You've a big actress,
come on, sit.
Red Fairy!
- Here take five rupees.
- Five rupees?
But the meter
shows twelve rupees.
- We used fuel worth five bucks.
- Is the cab your pop's?
- Don't reach my Dad.
- Okay, okay.
- Keep these five
rupees for your dowry. - Okay.
Marry a nice chap. These daily
fights are not meant for you.
Soon you' ll see me as
an all lndia star!
Have you ever seen
yourself in a mirror?
Get married before its late.
Or you' ll be left beating
the drums at a brothel.
Or you' ll and up as some one's
mistress.Now get lost l' m going.
Stupid girl! Wears rented
clothes and dreams of stardom!
My name is Chinchinchu,the night
is moonlight, you and me...
My buffalo has become
thin feeding you her milk.
I've got blisters on my hands,
washing your clothes.Pay me now.
You ate my salt and now want
to gulp down our money too.
You found this day to
come to claim your money.
Why Manju? What happened?
What is left to happen now?
My mom!
- What happened to her? - The
same that happened to Dilip...
... Kumar in Devdas and
Rajesh Khanna in Anand.
- Super hit!
- No, cancer.
When my mom is no more,
why should I live?
I too will die! Your milk...
- Not mine, my buffalo's.
- Whatever, your clothes.
Everything will
be dust in the end.
We came and will
return empty handed.
Be it a king or a beggar,
a Manju or a Bihari.
- Finally what's in your lives?
- What?
Nothing but a coffin and
There's nothing in
this game, nothing.
It's a two day game with income
tax problems in between.
When the heart is
broken, why live?
I am leaving.
Where's my house? Where?
Don't Manju! Are we dead?
In bad times we' ll help you.
No brother I've bothered
you enough already. No more now.
At the most people' ll
say she could pay...
... neither milk
nor clothes bill..
-... and what was your's?
- Salt.
And I couldn't even
pay for my mom's treatment.
Don't cry Manju.
Take this from me.
How can l?
- I have only twenty. Take them.
- Will do.
I too am a father.
Take this from my side.
It's okay.
How will I ever repay you?
Slowly, slowly.
Leave me alone with
my sorrows, please.
Let's go.
The night is moonlight,
you and me...
We' re very sorry to inform
you that your mother...
..who is admitted to the mental
hospital is suffering from fits.
Hence you are informed to
come and meet her immediately.
- How's my mother?
- Come, l' ll take you to her.
- Mom!
- No, don't touch me.
I' m a serpent. I' ll bite
you,run away, you unfortunate!
- Don't say that, mom.
- Go, run away, go!
I' ll bite you.
Open, sesame.
Brothers, you appear
very troubled.
If you don't mind,
may I help you?
The car's got locked. What' ll
you help? Get lost.
Incidently l' m a car expert.
Nobody knows a car better than me.
I can look at a car and
tell what's wrong with it.
There's another way
to start a car.
- How?
- With the key.
- How do you have the key?
- When Dad gave me this car,...
... would he keep the
key with himself?
I hope while leaving home
you all told your mothers...
... that you'd be late or
might not return at all.
You've returned, Suraj?
But it's only 4 a.m.!
The whole day is left.
How did you return so early?
It seems as
if you haven't slept.
The world rises with the
sun and l' m only your father.
I've told you often not to
spoil your sleep for me.
If his son comes home
breaking panes,...
... then the father can't sleep.
- Who told you that? - Somebody.
- Who? - The police.
They mustn't have told you that
I caught a car-stealing gang.
- Caught them? - Yes Dad.
- Very good!
But there are other things
that a man has to do.
Look Dad, I understand your
point, you too see my point.
I work with you in the factory
throughout the day.
Then I get a little time
so I go to the disco.
- And break window panes.
- Yes, I do.
- And I apprehend thieves.
- All that is fine but...
... at least select one girl
from the snaps I've shown you.
All the photos are good but none
of the girls is suitable.
Then what girl
do I bring for you?
Beautiful, dad!
When I return from work she
should take care of me & say...
One beer please.
Forget about beer! I won't
give you even a glass of water.
I' ll pay up your bill next week.
Why are you losing your sleep?
And you too have one chilled
beer on my account.
I' m hearing this for the
past one year.
I won't die
without paying your bill!
- After all what's my age?
- Thirty two.
Take these 32 rupees and give
me 2 bottles of beer.
- Want some?
- I drink with my own money.
And money is what she never has!
Give me one bottle for free.
This time it's on me next time
you pay for me.
No, no. I don't want it but if
you insist, l' ll have to accept.
- But only 2 bottles?
- How many will you drink?
As much as you can buy me.
- Doesn't anybody stop her?
- l' m not married as yet!
- I too am a bachelor!
- Then shall we?
Phokat, give us one beer please.
- There no more beer!
- Then get the bill.
-l' ll clear everthing next week.
-l' ll pay it.
Where do you live?
..House?
My house is very big-really big!
It takes so long to go from
one room to another that...
I' m thinking of buying a cycle.
- You didn't tell me your name.
- Sunita, Salma or Suzie.
How does it matter?
I' m only a woman...
... wanting to live in this
man's world on her own...
... terms.
- Yes, terms.
- And wants to drink others'
beer. - Shut-up!
It' s going to pour heavily.
I must go home. Okay.
- l' ll give you a lift.
- I neither take nor give lifts!
I' m going.
Where's my house?
It's this way.
" Wonder where she has come from"
" Wonder where she will go"
"This girl will make me go crazy"
" It is a short meeting"
" But it's very sad"
"This girl won't
be wooed by anyone"
" Your wet body will
set my body on fire"
" When the dark shadow of my
tresses falls on you"
" It will make you go crazy"
" You will miss me
all day and night"
" But it's very sad"
"This girl won't
be wooed by anyone"
"This wet girl, has she run
away from home and come"
"This is not a girl,
she is a serpent"
" Who has awakened
from sleep and come"
"Give your hand into mine"
" But it's very sad"
"This girl won't
be wooed by anyone"
"Sit comfortably besides me,
you need not fear"
" My state is not so bad
for me to fall in love with you"
" You will miss me
all day and night"
" But it's very sad"
"This boy won't be wooed by you"
Son, as far as I recall, you
have 6-7 umbrellas...
... 10-1 2 rain coats and
quite a few cars...
... that' ll the useful in this
rainy season.
- But if I wanted to get wet?
- Accepted.
But why are you ruining
the family reputation...
... wearing a girl's hat.
You've had enough tea, etc with
girls in the beer bars.
Now look at this snap of a
good girl that I've brought.
- This photo!
- Yes.
I've already promised her
parents.
Where did you find such a
beautiful girl?
- l' m your father.
- You' re truly great.
- Shall I fix things then?
- Let's go rightaway.
Not now, tomorrow.
You want to see Anju?
-But you've seen Anju? -I have
but l' m not marrying her!
Suraj is and
he wants to see her.
He's agreed to marry her?
- Who? - Mr. Vishwanath is
coming to see Anju.
- So let him come.
- But, but...
- l' ll manage everthing.
- How?
She hasn't created
a scene for long.
Mr. Viswanath, I don't
recall Anju's parents...
... having spoken of marriage...
... but if you say so,
it must be.
I thought you'd remember.
- That's why I telephoned you.
- Okay. Anju will soon be here.
What will you have?
We've come for a bride
and we' ll only take her.
There's dear Anju.
Careful.
Sit down, child, sit.
- Good day, good day.
- Live long dear child.
This is my son, Suraj.
Good day.
Make some tea.
Sugar,... how many spoons?
None, none for me, child.
- Won't you have beer?
- What?
Won't you show me the garden?
Yes, yes, my daughter, take him
Show him the garden.
Yes, yes. If you want
to go to the garden, go ahead.
Sometimes she gets
these kind of fits.
- Fits?
- Nothing much. Take her up.
Don't be scared. She' ll be fine.
For a while, I thought the
injection was adulterated.
God's justice can be
delayed not denied.
At least we've got relieved
of this problem.
What happened to your nephew?
I've called him;
must be on his way.
- What's his name? - Batuknath.
- What nath?

How will I wait so long?
Auntie?

I want Anju!
I want to marry her!
You will get Anju.
Rascal! You son of a cab!
Where is he?

This is all your plot, scoundrel.
Master even a bird is not...
..so foolish as to remain in the
cage if her life is in danger.
- She was a human being!
- A human being?
You told her she was a human
being? It is your plot?
That is why she
ran away from here.
She didn't run away,
she became free.
If I had my way, I'd have opened
her cage years back!
What didn't happen for years,
how did it happen now?
Hwo did she escape these walls,
these guards?
If Suraj sees me, he' ll take
me back there.
Where are you going so late?
Is this stolen stuff?
- It belongs to me.
- Make us too belong to you.
One minute!
Brothers, just a minute.
You can do what you want
to her but first...
... Iet me do what l
want to do to you all.
Who is it?
Idiot!
- Stupid, you' re here!
- Don't move!
- He's got hurt!
- Show! It's a deep gash.
We' ll have to take him to the
hospital. I' ll get my cab.
- No, no. - Go quickly. God!
- See, I got hurt.
Can you help me? He's got hurt
We need a doctor.
So, she's with Suraj!
I' ll show her.
Don't foolishly say anything
in front of Suraj!
I' ll sort her later.
Halt! Halt!...Blood?
So, whom have you murdered?
Whom will I murder, sir?
Quiet!
Not in uniform and joking?
- Okay I won't. - Alright,
how much in your wallet?
Some one is hurt. Let me go.
You' re acting
smart with Sukhi Ram?
You must be carrying stolen
stuff so you want to scram.
Search the boot we' ll know
right away. Cracking jokes?
- Sir, there's a corpse here!
- A corpse?
What are you saying!
- l' m alive, sir.
- So, is she your government?
No, sir. she's Manju. She's
slightly crazy. Come out.
Come out,
draped a sari and got in.
- What were you doing in there?
- l' m not Manju, sir.
I knew it, a girl in the boot,
blood on clothes, no money...
- You were kidnapping her!
- l' m no kidnap...
Quiet! Come to the police
station. You also please come.
- What's he saying? - He's
saying the patient is sick.
He needs rest and must
not be moved at all.
- Okay, l' ll take leave.
- Me too.
- Where are you off to?
- To see the doctor out.
Where are you going? We have to
look after you hospitably.
- Hospitably?
- Yes, who' ll look after me?
You look after them while I take
care of the doctor outside.
I' ll be back soon.
Where are you going?
Where are you going?
- Do you have any problem?
- l' ll show you problem!
See!
- Stupid!
- No, child, no!
- I won't spare you! - Madam,
I apologize on her behalf.
Who does she think she is!
Punish me but don't
say anything to her.
- Leave me! - Child,
what' re you doing? Come.
- Come.
- I won't spare you!
Child, we have enough problems
without you adding to them.
If you hadn't stopped me! I'd
have pound her to bits!
Okay, my dear, but shouldn't you
think of the consequences.
- Listen to me child.
- I won't forgive her.
- Listen to me child.
- She beat me!
Will you keep blabbering or let
me also say something?
- You spoilt everything! - What?
We have problems as it is!
You are not listening
or understanding anything.
Do you know what happened
while you were away?
- They don't know me!
- Do you know about Raju?
- What?
- Yes, do you know how Raju is?
You don't.
Come, come. I' ll show you!
Raju son, see who's come?
It's your sister.
No, don't get up! Now she won't
go anywhere. You won't will you?
- Sister!
- Go, go.
What happened to him?
- He's running fever. - He's
cried himself to this state!
And master didn't give him food.
Why did they stop his food?
Because they thought he
knew where you'd run away.
And when he would no longer be
able to bear hunger,...
... he'd reveal your whereabouts.
Tortured his own son!
Now don't ever leave me, please.
They think you
are somebody else;...
... whom they need desperately.
Stay for a few days and watch
the fun see what the matter is.
And then you have to settle
scores with that fatso!
Alright, I won't go. Where the
father's heart is like stone...
... there you need a sister like
me. Now no one will starve you.
How many times do I tell you?
She's just pretending.
I know her, ask her.
Don't act smart with me!
Do you know him?
No, sir.
- You... You don't know me?
- No sir.
- You don't know me?
- I said once, I don't.
I' ll give you one slap. She's
drunk and acting on top of it?
- I don't drink liquor.
- lndeed! You....
You raise your hand on a woman!
On a woman!
Lock him up in a cell, one night
inside and he' ll gain senses.
- And me? - You go
home. I' ll deal with him.
Can't I stay here?
- I told you she's bonkers.
- You keep quiet! Take him away!
You've done no wrong so you
can't stay here. You go.
- Where will I go?
- To your house - House?
What's she doing here?
Using my make-up?
Is this your father's that
you' re dolling up with it?
May not be! Maybe its your
father's so what if I use it?
Back answering? Stayed out for
awhile and found your tongue!
I' ll show you. So what? I' ll
throw your bones to the dogs!
I' ll show you. So what? I' ll
throw your bones to the dogs!
Did you work
at a butchers earlier?
How dare you, you bitch!
Your lipstick is imported but
your language lndian...
...& in our country everyone has
the right to speak his language.
You spoke your tongue
now it's my turn.
- Darling this is a dagger
what's it? - Dagger!
If it cuts you, blood oozes out.
You've always done make-up
in your own style...
... today l' ll make over your
face in my own style.
Keep away the evil eye, god!
Now smile and show. Smile.
Smile lovingly now cry and smile.
Laugh loudly. Good.
- What happened to Suraj? Is he
fine? -Don't worry Mr.Viswanath.
He's alright. I' ll drop
him home myself tomorrow.
- Tribhuvan? - Yes.
I' m Tribhuvan speaking.
- Listen.
- I am listening.
I know that. you' re
speaking and l' m listening.
- What happened to you?
- Nothing. Who is it?
- Amba!
- Amba isn't home, go away.
- Then where has Amba gone?
- Me! I' m Amba!
Ghost! no. You' re not a ghost,
Mr.Viswanath. Go wash your face.
You speak of washing my face?
I bathe daily unlike you!
I know you've had a bath, I have
not washed my face since morning.
- Go, go go. - Tribhuvan,
why are you tongue-tied?
He's gone mad!
- What happened? - l' m in
this house because of you...
... and you disappeared.
See, l' m hurt.
I could need anything and you
don't care one little bit!
What do you want?
....What do you want?
- l.. I' m thirsty.
- Leave me!
I' ll get water, leave me.
Leave me.
He left me.
" My heart pines for you"
" It's difficult
to live without you"
" What do I do?"
" lmmortalise your love"
"Take my name and die"
"That's the only cure for you,
O my crazy lover"
" From morn to night"
" My heart chants only your name"
" What's so special about me
that's made you so crazy"
" You are so beautiful,
I need you"
" What do I do..."
" Your body is fire,
it has singed me"
" Your talks make me swoon"
" Do I take that as your refusal,
or your consent"
" What do I do..."
We've come at the right time.
Jaggu has come.
You've come back brother?
Where were you all night?
- In jail.
- Were you getting thrashed?
- Where's Manju?
- Don't take her name.
I was in jail because of her.
- l' m fuming at her name.
- What has she done?
What an actress!
Says, she doesn't know me!
Has never seen me!
And then sat in my boot.
I am fed up of her! I swear some
day, l' ll chop her to pieces!
- And do you know what she says?
- What?
What's that
liquor... no... wine.
She says I don't drink wine, sir.
What's so funny?
She's done one show and
thinks she's a great star!
- l' m fed up of her!
- So now where's she?
How the hell do
I know where she is?
The police is also strange!
Locked me in and released her!
- So, she didn't come with you?
- Yes, thank god...
You! Get out!
- Look Manju.
- My name is Anju.
- She's changed her name
overnight. - Oh!
- What else have you changed,
mom? - l' m not your mother?
If you are following me to beg
forgiveness,forget it & get out!
- Where do I go? - That is your
house. Go and die there!
- That's my house?
- Mother, that's your house...
... and that's mine, that's
a tyre and this is Jaggu...
This is the earth and
that, the sky.
That's east and this west.
- This is north and that south.
- I know that - What?
North, south, east and west.
Will you go or should l
make over your face? Go!
- Mr.Jaggu! - You, here,
at this hour? What do you want?
Can I sleep here?
Why? Are the bed bugs
playing in your house?
No,no. But l' m feeling
very scared, all alone.
You are scared? The world is
scared of you!
I won't bother you. I' ll
sleep here quietly.
Okay, how does it bother me?
Go, lie down!
Thanks very much!
Where were you the whole day?
Do you know what happened
in your absence.
- What troubles have... - Not
so far but if you sit tight..
... then there will be
the devil to pay!
Since she's come, she's
made life miserable!
I' ll hit her so hard that
she' ll forget everything.
Bring my hunter.
You ingratiate! Now I know you
instigate Anju against us!
You, old man, you!
Wear it Tribhuvan,
wear this bangle.
The hands that think
its masculinity...
... to beat an old,
helpless man...
-...will look good with
this bangle. - Who are you?
My name Maybe anything;
Sita, Sakina or Suzie..
... Kamla, Vimla or Anju.
How does a name matter?
I' m just a woman who in
this world made by men...
... is standing alone...
... against the cruelty,
torture and bestiality of men.
Till today I had bangles in my
hand while you had the whip.
But today I've thrown those
bangles away.
Now they' ll be in your hands...
... and this whip in my hands.
How dare you!
Have you gone mad?
You hit with these very hands
huh?
Scream louder!
Get up!
Scream! Let the walls of this
house hear your screams.
Let the whole country hear you!
Let every man and woman hear.
When a whip comes into the
hands of a woman then...
... the world becomes
insufficient...
... for people like you
to escape!
Wear the bangle!
Wear it!
Run!
As long as l' m here, if I see
this whip,...
... I' ll whip your skin off!
Grandpa, l' m very hungry.
Get me something to eat.
Yes, child, l' ll bring it.
Don't come here.
The liquor has gone.
- Where are you going so late?
-I was getting house in the fear
... Chhee! I was getting scared
in the house.
I was looking for you only.
- You also get scared Manju?
- l' m not Manju!
- If not Manju, then who' re you?
- l' m Anju.
There she starts again!
- Jaggu, what's happening?
- She must've had cheap liquor!
She drinks daily
but never does this!
Yes, I too am seeing this
for the first time!
May be, a ghost...
It's possible, quite possible!
- Now what do we do?
- There's only one cure.
- Johny - Who's he, a dancer?
- No, an exorcist.
- He' ll exorcise her ghost
- Yes. - Swear by me - Yes.
Then lets call him.
"O Ghost, leave her"
"Just wait"
" I will control you"
" Run away"
"Someone explain to me,
I am confused"
" l' m in trouble"
" Amidst of ghosts
a lone girl like me"
" I left the house..."
"... I lost the way"
" From the frying pan
into the fire"
" Now you will have my thrashing"
"This is true, I am not a ghost"
" l' m a beautiful maiden"
" l' m in trouble"
" Amidst of ghosts
a lone girl like me"
"The ghost deserves to
be thrashed"
" You all seem like ghosts to me"
"The messengers of death"
" What did you say"
" It's night during the day,
an unusual thing happened"
" What has fate done"
" l' m in trouble"
" Amidst of ghosts
a lone girl like me"
"O Ghost, leave her"
" Please forgive me,
Do justice to me"
" I agree to whatever you say"
" I recognize everybody"
" Fate defeated me, I give up"
"The ghost has left"
" Now stop this music"
Shut up!
My body is aching.
Press it a little.
Such a long Balma! This manner
of yours drives me insane!
- What else do I say?
- Not say but do.
With these delicate hands
of yours..
... attend to me.
- Attend? - Don't you understand
massage me with oil.
Once I'd told you and you'd
massaged me and that dog...
... massage - I remember.
But what hand do you
prefer soft or hard?
I' m a man - no soft touch
for me. I want a hard massage.
- You want a hard hand.
- Yes. She's trapped!
Why are you closing the door?
- To massage you!
- Massage!
You want a massage?
Then shut your eyes!
This is the hard hand
and this the soft one!
- And now for the really
hard ones. - Help, help!
Help!
- Batuk! - Balma - Whose?
- Yours - Not mine!
- Who are you?
- l' m a small little, cute baby.
- Oh! He's our Balma?
- See what Anju has done to him.
Send him back to the village.
He's had it. I' m going.
Mr.Jaggu!
Chhee! How filthy! Everyone
keeps flowers; he; a broom!
Kerosene!
It seems to be some dirty,
stale water.
Today is Sunday. So? It's
the day to drink liquor.
Miss.Manju, what's in this?
There was some horribly stinking
thing in it so I threw it.
Oh! Horribly stinting?
Where did you throw it dear?
- In the drain.
- In the drain?
My fifteen rupees worth
of liquor down the drain!
- Then what's in this?
- K...ke...kerosene.
- Did I do right?
- Get out or l' ll hit you hard!
Forgive me please.
Hit me if you wish.
Forgive me. If I knew you'd get
angry, I wouldn't have done it!
- What's in this?
- Food.
- Where did you get it from?
- From out! No,l mean I made it.
I thought you'd be
hungry, is it tasty?
Yes but next time ask
me before you do anything.
Okay can I keep this plate down?
No keep holding it in your hand.
- May I leave? - Yes.
- Can I take this? - Yes.
Mr.Mathur?
Good day, Miss.Anju.
Miss.Anju, you' re
looking different today.
And Mr.Tribhuvan, you too
look quite different today!
- I hope you've feeling fine.
- The weather is affecting him.
How strange! People are
affected differently...
... by this change of weather.
Betel leaf. Will you have?
Here.
Here are your papers.
Sign then.
- Where do I sign?
- What happened to your hand?
The tanpura fell on it.
The whole instrument.
Only this got saved-
the thumb, will it do?
Will do. Why not?
I know you since childhood.
- Here's your money.
- l' ll keep it.
- These are mine?
- Of course.
I' ll leave now.
Uncle isn't feeling too good.
Anju, give this money to Amba.
She' ll keep it in the locker.
Yes dear, times are bad
thieves abound all over.
- That I can see. - Give it
here. I' ll keep it safe.
I too can keep it.
Where's the key, Miss.Amba?
- With Tribhuvan. - What?
The key is always with you!
-I gave it to you in the morning
- But I retuned it by evening.
My palm is itching.
If don't get the key soon,
this will start off.
Listen to me,
give her the key.
Then what' ll happen to you?
If you don't give the key, then
what will happen to you?
- Did you think of that?
- This is no time to think Amba!
In any case, what is in one key?
- Everything! - Give up worldly
attachments and give her the key
- Should l? - Yes!
- It's in your pocket.
Here's the bunch of keys, Anju.
Thank you, Tribhuvandas, loafer.
Good that you came on time,
grandpa.
Now on, you' ll keep these keys.
- Keep these in the vault.
- But...
Everything is beyond control.
If we don't do anything,
we' re finished.
I can't think
unless you keep shut.
- Okay, think.
- Got it! - What?
Food in the picnic and
double dose in the food.
Double dose, my foot! I' ll add
something to your food that...
... you' ll be floating
on clouds.

Yes, Anju, I too love you
but my dad is in not in favour.
Eloping is not the answer.
Try to understand, Anju.
Okay l' ll talk
to dad once more,...
... if he doesn't agree
we' ll run away.
Son, with whom are you
talking about running away?
With Anju, Daddy.
Son Suraj, you are my only child.
And I want you to be happy. I
had absolutely no idea that...
... you love Anju,
with such fervour.
If you wish, l' ll fix
your wedding with Anju.
- Really Daddy? Then l' ll go
and tell Anju immediately.
No, no, you sit. I' ll
call up and inform her.
- What happened to the phone?
- It's been out of order.
- Then whom were you talking to?
- I was rehearsing.
But don't go back
on your word, Daddy!
Just like his father!
Where are you taking me?
I' m taking you to meet an
important man; my boss!
Forgive me boss, in this cab
business and heavy traffic...
... I had no time
to come to see you.
You know the world's problems.
So you know my problems too.
Wish. Not me, the boss.
You are my mother, father,
boss, friend, everything...
... so l' m telling you. I've
decided that next week...
... I' ll marry Manju.
- I've got the cards printed.
- What are you saying?
Do you have any objections?
- But..
- Do I have any bad habits?
- Do you love somebody else?
- Chhee, Chhhee!
All over the world, girls are
growing old.
You won't find a boy like me
in the whole world.
Later you' ll repent.
If there's a problem,
and you want to refuse,...
... say so before boss.
Don't create problems later.
But I never refused!
Come!
How are you?
Fine, I hope.
You' re enjoying all this;...
... this house,
it's luxuries, the servants...
- Who won't enjoy it?
- Yes, who won't?
Specially when it's not your
own but somebody else's.
- What do you mean?
- Meaning this is Anju's house.
This wealth, these luxuries,
servants, everything is Anju's
And even Suraj!
No, not Suraj! Suraj!
Suraj is mine!
He loves you thinking
you are Anju...
... that too is Anju's debt
to you.
- What are you saying? - These
are Anju's leftovers that...
... you are getting
due to good fortune.
- No, no, no...
- What no, no, no
At least don't fool yourself.
You are fooling the others!
I didn't stay here by my own
will. They need me here.
No, they needed you but no more.
One doesn't wear a mask forever.
After the show, the
mask is taken off.
Now your show too is over.
Your welfare lies in revealing
your true self now.
Or don't you feel like returning
to the poverty of the slum?
Bit me! Look Manju, if you don't
tell Suraj the truth...
... then the result
of the deceit will be terrible.
Look Manju, if you don't
tell Suraj the truth...
... then the result
of the deceit will be terrible.
I was coming towards your place.
- I too was coming to you.
- It was imperative to meet you.
For me too!
Suraj, I don't want to keep
you in the dark anymore.
Why you! Nobody can keep
Suraj in the dark!
I want to tell you
everything truthfully, today.
Don't take the trouble.
I know the truth.
- What do you know?
- I didn't expect this from you.
Suraj! I was helpless!
At the hands of love?
That love seems very strong.
But I don't want to
lengthen this drama anymore.
- l' m very tired! - That happens
when you board 2 boats.
You are right. Leading 2 lives,
I've forgotten my real life!
You have probably forgotten
whom you are deceiving.
- Me, him or yourself?
- What are you saying? - Maybe
you are amongst those girls...
...for whom one man
is not quite enough!
What? You! You!
- You' re crossing limits!
- What limits have you left?
Such a dirty thing about me!
How could you even think?
If you can do dirty things,
can't I think of them?
What have I done?
What?
What you've done? What have
you done is unpardonable!
It's my decency that l' m
talking not killing you!
Look mister, I don't know
what you saw or didn't.
But after seeing
this face of yours,...
... I don't want to talk to you.
- Now the truth is out!
- Yes, it is!
Give me some liquor!
- What did you say?
- Liquor! Give, quick!
- You' ll drink liquor?
- No, l' ll eat it!
Don't be miserly. Give
me a drink quickly.
Damn it! Tell me honestly.
What happened to your brain?
Don't spoil my brain!
Give me a half, quarter bottle,
whatever...
But you said drinking
is not good!
If you want to give me liquor,
give, don't yap needlessly!
I' m not asking for free.
I' ll pay you, later.
Why don't I understand
these women?
Sometimes they are so sweet,
at others so evil!
I' ll drink lots today.
I' ll die drinking.
Without drinking you create
a nuisance...
... if you drink and you' ll die!
There's nothing to
live for in any case!
You tell me, will you
give me liquor or not?
- You won't drink. - I will.
- No. - Yes.
He refuses!
What cheek!
- Got some rope?
- Yes, shall I bring it?
- Here.
- Thanks.
- What are you doing?
- Suicide!
You don't let me drink or die!
Then what do I do?
I don't want to be a
widower before marriage.
- What do you want?
- Liquor! Just now!
You had given up then how come?
- How does it matter to you?
- Something is wrong.
No, it doesn't who' ll drink this?
I' ll drink, my wife and kids
will drink, what's it to you?
- Take this money. - I was
just asking. -....What?
Making inquiries!
Scoundrel.
It's so late. He hasn't
returned as yet!
He must be having
a drink himself.
- Jaggu what's this?
- Not for me, for my fiancee.
Disgusting!
Holy cow!
Now she's praying!
Changed her dress too!
Take, drink now.
Why, is it a custom to drink
wine before marriage?
From liquor, she's come to wine
Drink quickly now.
- You had given up drinking!
- So had you! - Me?
I don't touch wine.
You know that.
- They' ll break!
- Let them!
What happened to you
all of a sudden?
- l' m going insane with
happiness. - Then its okay.
What is? Now do you
want this or not?
No. Gandhiji said that
in life... - Quiet!
You' ll drive me mad! I' ll marry
you now before you change again.
Where are you going?
Gandhiji said return the bottles!
- Give me one 420.
- Sir I've heard of 120 and 300.
... but what is 420?
- Add the two. Result?
- 420 - Give me the same.
Hey, make one for him.
Good grief!
The best of guys get
floored on seeing her!
-She's the pride of our colony.
-The pride of your colony?
- Anju?
- Not Anju, but Manju.
You may hit me but
she's Manju of our colony.
- Aunt when did you come out?
- l' m getting better now!
- Have you seen Manju? - ldiot,
listen Manju is her daughter.
She's worshiping
Jaggu's taxi, Aunt.
Why is she worshiping
Jaggu's taxi?
Don't you know?
They' re going to get married.
Yes Aunt, really, have
a sweet for this good news.
This glass looks so small...
... but must have gulped
a lot of bottles.
And with every bottle,
many sorrows, many unfaithful...
Unfaithfulness?
One can measure a bottle by
the depth of the glass...
... but the depth of a woman's
heart can't be measured!
No one knows how much of
deceit and deception is there!
Whatever enters a woman's
heart is only to wound her.
One who doesn't have a
heart can't feel any wounds.
- l' m Balma speaking.
- Who?
I' m a small, little, cuddly..
I've solved the case now I know
how that kitten became a lioness.
- What? - Actually there are
not one but two litters.
What nonsense? Kittens!
Anju is standing here,
in a slum before my eyes.
- But Anju is here!
- She's Manju her twin sister.
If you don't believe me,...
... I' ll bring Anju
to the house right now.
And l' ll bring her mother too.
Don't do that! Bring
has to the Alibag house.
Alibag house?
Okay l' ll bring her right away.
The Alibag house?!
Your to-be husband is in front
of you and you worship a cab?
Not Jaggu! Say Balma.
- Say Balma!
- Balma.
- Say my Balma.
- My Balma. - Yes!
- Daughter! - There,
the mother too has come.
- You too come along. Come
- Jaggu.
Brother, Gandhiji said
to return the bottles.
Hey John, thank you
very much. I' m getting married.
- You must come. Don't forget.
- But who's the girl?
It must be a special
girl who put down my meter.
Friend, but tell us who it is.
She's a true lndian woman.
Like Savitri, Sakubai,
Anusuya, Meerabai.
She's always praying,
all the time.
Changed clothes again!
What are you doing?
Can't you see, l' m drinking?
I can't understand
when you pray & when you drink!
- l' m feeling dizzy
- Stupid ass!
I asked for a bottle and
you vanished.
Bottle, again?
Forgot what Gandhiji said?
Look if you want to drink, get
your own bottle.Don't bother me!
Next week we' re getting married
so don't talk like this!
Marriage?
- Whose marriage?
- Mine
How funny!
You' re getting married?
To whom?
You, who else!
- Me? - Yes.
- Drunk without drink?
Look, I've tolerated enough
if I get angry... then?
Go, go whom are you threatening?
Why should I marry you?
Don't make me angry or l' ll
give you one slap on your face!
You son of a taxi lay
a finger on me and see!
- You want to see?
- Yes, I want to!
- Want to see more?
- Yes!
I have no one who' ll
save me. Beat me more.
Now if you raise your hand,
l' ll rip it out.
I also know one shouldn't
hit women but when the taxi..
..doesn't start it has to be
pushed. We marry next week.
... and now she's pretending.
- Again?
- When did I agree to marry you?
- l' ll show you!
See! See! You won't marry me?
Am I mad?
Bitch! In front of God
you accepted and now you deny!
She can never
belong to one man.
- What do you mean?
- You pretend to love me and...
Pretend to marry him.
- What? Pretending to love you?
- All false!
- Then what's true, this?
No, Manju has always loved
you and will only love you!
- Who is Manju? - She, who else?
what name did she give you?
Savitri, Anusuya, Sita.
But she is Anju!
Jaggu, that Balma,
Auntie, kidnap, Manju.
What nonsense is that?
Speak clearly.
Some Balma has
kidnapped Auntie and Manju.
- But l' m right here.
- But you are Anju!
- I am Manju!
- One minute, one minute!
He was saying two kittens,
twins Anju-Manju...
- Twins?
- Twin sister?
Take care of this menace.
She's the root of our problems.
Finish her off! Once she's no
more, we' ll have no problems!
Uncle, let me go.
I've done nothing!
You haven't so far,
but now you will.
Today is your 21 st birthday...
... and according to
your father's will,...
... you inherit everything
today.
- What's written in it? - That
of your own sweet will,...
... without any compulsions,...
... you' re willing
the property over to me.
- You are, aren't you?
- No child, no!
- Don't sign or they' ll kill
you! - Quiet, old woman!
- Sign it, dear Anju!
- l' ll sign.
- Sign!
- Where? - Here.
Stop Jaggu! He's got
a revolver in his hand.
- Then what do we do? - We' ll
think of some plan. Come.
Do you know
what's written in this?
That l' m committing suicide!
Wait Mr. Tribhuvandas, wait!
This signature is false,
so is the girl!
She's not Anju but Manju,
this taxi driver's Manju.
- Taxi driver's Manju?
- Yes, according to his plan...
Manju came and started
living in your house.
And he kidnapped my poor Anju.
- What nonsense are you talking?
- You' ll know soon. Talk!
- No.
- Will you talk or not?
You' re strange!
Put me in this situation
and watch the fun coolly!
Tell them
what's our relationship.
- Your relation with Anju?
- Not her, but her, my Laila...
... Amba.
- What? Are you bonkers?
Yes, that's why, in greed,
I listened to you.
Here, stay here yes,
tell me what did she say?
I' ll tell you all.
She saw me once
with Manju and came to me...
... and said send Manju
to my house...
... and they'd have murdered you.
And we' ll he 50-50
partners in the inheritance.
- Shall I go?
- He's lying!
- I never saw him before!
- Shameless!
I' ll sort her out later.
First lets check out Anju-Manju.
- Tell us, who is she?
- She, she...
She's my daughter, Manju.
I' m Anju!
If she's Manju!
Where's Anju?
I know where she is!
She's waiting for him,
in the garden outside.
I'll get her in a jiffy.
I' m Anju!
No, no, no... I' ll do
as you say from now on.
She's genuine!
Then come up with me quickly.
How can I walk?
First untie my legs.
They tied me up
and went away Balma!
- I made a mistake in judging
you. - What do you mean?
Meaning I didn't find
any good person in my life.
So I couldn't recognise
a good man with you.
What a sad thing! Both sisters
came together into this world...
...and will also leave together.
And with them will be
martyred this taxi driver!
What are you saying?
Doesn't matter!
I have another one.
You belong to me and I to you.
Deception! Deceit!
Today l' ll beat you so much that
you' ll never tease anyone again.
- Uncle!
- He's running away!
The girl got changed!
They've cheated us!
- Cheating Tribhuvan!
- I told you, he's a liar!
They' ll all die, at
my hands but dear Anju...
... you have to drink poison
according to the suicide note.
Amba, push it down her throat!
Jaggu! No, leave me!
I don't want to die!
Look after them!
Amba let us go.
Jaggu poison...
Sister!
- l' m very frightened!
- Don't be!
With me here
no harm will befall you.
- But they troubled me a lot!
- What?
They used to whip
me and injections...
-... and today...poison
- Poison?
- They forced me to drink
poison! - What!
- I don't want to die! Save me.
- Yes, sister.
I've found you after ages,
I won't lose you easily. Come.
Come. I' ll take
you to the hospital!
You' ll go to the
hospital if I allow you!
Sister!
Your sister is almost finished.
Soon you too will be!
Leave me! Sister!
Sister! Leave me!
Jaggu, you take Anju to the
hospital l' ll manage things here
Manju, you check on
Uncle-Aunt, l' ll remain here.
- Send me to my village.
- Why?
Because l' m a small,
little, cute, sweet baby.
I won't let you go. I won't!
How dare you!
You brought her just in
time. Soon she' ll be fine!
Tribhuvan was saved but
the law didn't spare him.
Jaggu took his boss's
blessings and married Anju.
And there Manju and
Suraj too set up a house.
And after exactly one year,
their children were born.
And that too, twins.
" He called my name"
" I held on to my heart"
" He teased me I turned away"
" What else could I do"
" He was standing in the street"
" He was after me since very long"
" He seemed very obsessed"
