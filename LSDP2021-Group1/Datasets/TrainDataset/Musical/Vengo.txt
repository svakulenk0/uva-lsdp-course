I've got somebody

Yeah, who?
He wants to remain anonymous.

If it's that scumbag family,
I'd rather torch the place.
Got that? I won't have anything
to do with them!
oK, Pepe...
See you later.
'Bye, kid.
Hey, Fernando.

Come to your uncle.
So, got anything to tell me?
No?
And I bother bringing you
to Seville!
I can't believe this!
Nothing to tell me?
You ashamed?
How did it go with the girl?
Don't wanna tell me?

It was good
but it wasn't love.
It wasn't love?
That ass, those breasts...
what d'you call that?
what more do you want?
Cut it out, fella.
You got your rocks off.
You want a woman just for yourself,
who stays at home?
It wasn't love.
Shit, you're too much!
In the street of wlnds
I devoured you
Down to your beauty mark
In the street of wlnds
In the street of hurly-burly
Your body and mlne
Came together
La Caita, pure gypsy!
You know I love you.
I love you a lot.
Hurray for art!
Hurray for flamenco!
True flamenco!
Alma, join us!
Dance with my nephew.
Pepa,
my little girl...
Your death burns me.
what's the matter?
Listen.
This tree's got duende.
Sounds like a lament.
This tree's got duende.
It sings like El Chocolate.
Uncle,
we found Pepa's favorite tape.
Play it for me.
Let me...
who's singing?
I dunno.
when she listened to it,
she always used to cry.
Enjoy the party the other night?

Las Cigalas from Jerez.
Ask Alejandro and Antonio
to bring them.

Anselmo, I told you
never to leave him alone!
My uncle

for the party.
oK, I'll handle it.

Caco wants this group.
I just saw...
some terrific looking girls!
Long live Andalusia!

She's so beautiful!
Porinas was one hell of a singer.
The best
was Camarón.
oK, but Porinas was the best
in the Extremadura region.
Yeah, but...
the best was Camarón.
These flowers!
They're all faded!
See these flowers, Mercedes?
lt's a soulless garden.
They're fading.
Be quiet, my uncle's sleeping.
All right.
SANDRo, YoU will BE AVENGED
Someone scrawled
over the walls of my village.
It wasn't us.
They wrote:
"Sandro, you will be avenged."
Lots of people liked Sandro.
My brother had lots of friends.
I was fond of him, too.
we want to christen
Sandro's daughter.
what am I supposed to do?
lt's a shame her father's dead.
A real shame.
Your brother Mario
killed Sandro.
where's Mario?
where's your brother?
You go see my brother Mario.
Give him this mobile.
He has to call Diego.
Tell him "m afraid for him.
Give him these 200,000 pesetas.
where is he?
I didn't tell anyone.
Count on me.
At the Atlas Hotel, in Chefchaouen,
in Morocco.
Tell him I care about him.
That we love him.
Aunt Pilar never stops crying.
Diego thinks about him a lot.
It feels like rain.
lt's good for the soil.
I am jealous
of the rlver
Whlch reflects your face
I don't feel up
to my songs
I don't feel up to my thoughts
I don't know what It Is
But "m really stuck on,,,
The one-armed crlpple's face
C'mon...
Tell your uncle.
I was really in love with Pepa.
You were?
Really in love.
- Did you tell her?
- I didn't say anything.
Let's change the subject.
Uncle...
I'm worried.
what about?
Because there's a rumor going 'round
that the Caravacas
want to kill me.
what?
who told you that?
lt's not true.
Listen, Diego...
If anyone tries to hurt you,
I'll cut his balls off.
And I'll burn everything down.
Here, Diego...
I'm taking you to a christening.
Put this ring on.
It was Pepa's.
Never take it off. You promise?
Give your uncle a kiss.
Hello? Don't hang up.
I'm trying to pick you up.
Don't hang up.
I'm not receiving you.
I can't hear anything.
Don't hang up.
Alejandro, who is it?
Dunno, Morocco...
Don't hang up. Just a second!
I'm trying to pick you up.
I hear you better now.
Now?
Mario! How you doing?

Go get the kid!
Tres, go on. Run, quick!
we're always with him,
Tres, Antonio and me.

Caco is never by himself.
Right now?
Know where I am?
In the middle of the road,
the only place I can receive.
Hold on.
Go play Pepa's CD.
Is it winter there yet?
Cloudy skies?
The weather's fine in Andalusia.
Diego is fine, really.
Listen!
I come from nowhere
I have no landscapes
I have no homeland
Wlth my flngers, I can start a flre
Wlth my heart, I slng to you
And my heartstrlngs throb
I was born of love
Beautiful, isn't it?
whenever you want.
No, you can't talk to Caco now.
He's totally smashed.
He can't even talk.
Yeah, he drinks all the time.
Here comes handsome.
I'll put your kid on.
Your father.
Stand here!
This is where you can hear him.
How are you?
I'm oK.
You coming home soon?
I want to see you real soon.
I think...
a lot about you.
I love you, Papa.
The kid's on the phone.
lt's important,
he's talking to his father.
lt's the only place he can hear.
Just a second, please.
'Evening.
Caco, you can't go on board.
The Caravacas are there.
we do as you say.
I don't give a shit about them.
Hey, how are you?
why do you let that family
on board?
Long live Moors!
And pretty women!
She's a whore!
why'd you take his money?
what's that?
It was a gift.
Take it back!
Lay off the Caravacas!
No scandals on my boat!
I don't want any bloodshed here.
You have to leave.
I'm not afraid.
Please don't stay here.
I'm not afraid, I said!
But you're afraid of God.
Not even God.
No one!
Look!
Look!
Get out!
Now get lost!
Alejandro...
You love me...
You understand me, don't you?
Lie down.
Kid!
The Caravacas' bodyguards
want to talk to you.
Good to see you.
I wanna discuss some business
we have to settle with Caco.
You know we've got nothing
against you,
just against Caco.
My brother and I respect you.
You're almost part of the family.
we knew you as a kid.
You know that Mario killed
my brother.
we looked for him everywhere,
in Andalusia and abroad.
Tell us where he is,
or his son will pay.
He has to pay.
Someone will pay
for my brother's death!
- I don't know anything.
- Fine.
Paco, serve him what he wants.
Have something to drink.
Ugly business, eh?
It doesn't concern us.
The Caravacas are our employers...
A beer.
For me, too.
I work for the
Raíz del Cante label
as musical director.
This is our latest CD.
La Paquera of Jerez.
You can have it.
- Tell me what you think.
- For me?
You did the sleeve design?
Yeah, "m a graphic artist.
I do the jackets, the posters...
You outdid yourself.
So, kid?
Chatting with the buddies?
we're having a drink
with our pal from Jerez.
Jerez, my ass!
- You're nuts!
- No, you are!
You fools!
You swine!
You got it wrong.
Don't touch me, for chrissake!
You're just dirt!
You and your family!
Sonofabitch!
Get your knife out.
C'mon, get it out!
Someone's gonna get hurt!
He doesn't know a thing.

There are plenty here.
There are plenty over here.
Come on!
You gonna eat all that?
No, it's to play soccer with.

Things are getting worse.
Starting to stink.
Children,
it's not nice to play with food.
Hello, cousins!
Alejandro, a cigarette, please.
You oK?
I need a smoke.

to party...
Tres, Antonio, you and me.
There're gonna be gypsy musicians
and some gorgeous dancers.
we'll bring them here.
I'm gonna throw a party.
A party so grandiose
everybody will be talking about it!
Just to bug the Caravacas.
Know how we'll pay for it?
I sold "El Rey."
To some real hot Germans.
And they paid it all in cash.
I'll give you
You know how, you can organize it.
what's the matter?
what the hel"s the matter?
I've always told you the truth.
Tres found out that the Caravacas
want to hurt Diego.
Hurt Diego?
They want to kill him.
He's Mario's closest kin.
Let them just touch the kid
and I'll torch their casino.
I'm gonna need you.
whatever you want, when you want.
Have pity on me. Just a little.
Just a little bit.
You see how "m suffering.
Help me a little.
May God keep you pure.
Hello, Enrique.

This is a family affair.

Good faith?
I brought my nephew.
- He wants to hear La Paquera.
- Your brother killed mine!
You'd better leave!
This is an insult to us!

Did the women send you?
You a coward?
No, leave!

- I won't go anywhere with you!
- C'mon.

This has to end.
Not this way.
Your brother is the cause
of all this!
You're just here to piss us off!
No dignity, no tact!
You piece of shit! You swine!
You and your whole family.
Calm down, you lunatic.
I won't calm down.
You know what you've done.

They're talking.
That's enough! Let them talk.
we're not thugs or animals.

we just have to wait.
This is a family affair, goddammit!
You're not here to talk,
but to insult us.
You're the animals!
You're animals,
incapable of reason.
You don't understand anything.
our grandfathers were like
two brothers.
Your grandfather and mine worked
the fields together.
Let's stop making
a spectacle of ourselves here.
why?
Know what it cost me to come here?
An arm and a leg!
Think it doesn't cost me anything?
Know what you are?
You're backwards.
You live in another age.
I never should've come to see you.
You're a bird of ill-omen!
He said what?
lt's not gonna be easy.
It will need time.
obviously.
Still, I think we calmed
him down a bit.
- where we right to come?
- Sure.
I hope it was worth it.
Uncle...
I really enjoyed the party
the other day.
A lot.

You sure you'll be all right?
Sure, "m sure. Everything's fine.

- Not lying to me?
- Not at all!
Give me a kiss.
Goodbye.
Is he really all right?
Yeah.

Get back in the car.
You'll get Diego worried.
Can't I be alone?
All alone, with myself!
what's the matter with you?

Get in the car.
