Sir, our consignment has left from
Geneva on the twentieth
Okay. Make arrangements for its
clearance. -Okay.
Sir, our seafood export contract in
Germany has been extended for
another year.
Good.
Sir, Mr. Morrison from New York has
called and agreed to open a factory
in our collaboration.
-That's very good.
Sir, Kailasnath and his company has
quoted a real low rate in their tender..
Kishanlalji, we will quote an even
lower rate.... -But sir,...
...remember, we should not lose this
contract come what may, okay..
Yes, Kishanlalji... speak your mind
lts not my place to say this, but sir,
we may suffer a loss if we quote an
even lower rate than Kailasnath and
his company..
How much will we lose? One crore,
two crores, four crores.....it does not
make a difference.
But, this will hurt Kailasnath forever
and l can't bear to Kailasnath live
a good and happy life.
Dayashankar! Dayashankar!
He always tips over and upsets my
win at the last minute by his games
l always end up a loser. Never mind,
my name is Kailasnath...
We know that since our childhood
Shut up! My own son is making fun
of me! Even l will have my day. And
that day l will destroy him forever.
But when will that day come father?
lt will come. Every dog has its day.
You hurt his feelings
My friend Rajpal, l still remember
that day twenty years ago.....
Greetings brother....
You! Why have you come here now?
How can you not know why l'm here?
lt's the same thing every time.
Twenty lakhs rupees. For now, l will
make do with that much.
Kailasnath, you have taken more
than your inheritance. Now you will
not get anything.
lts not that easy to get rid of me.
Besides, we are related by blood
l don't believe in such blood relations
You are a result of my father's
mistake and l have to suffer for it
Yes, you are right. That old man died
before he could pay for his mistake.
As it is, that's the way things usually
are... one makes a mistake while
somebody else pays for it. Anyway,
you are his sole son in the eyes of
the world, while l am his illegitimate
son....his bastard.
Yes, bastard! You have proved that
someone like you can never improve
l am going to be around you all the
time, bugging you.
GET OuT!
Here you go. Rajpal, if you don't mind..
can l ask you a question? -Yes
You look very worried nowadays
Yes, l have been very worried.
What happened?
My father made a mistake once.
Every time his son Kailasnath comes
here, l get real anxious.
He is a bad man and he can do
anything anytime.
Don't worry, my friend. l am with you.
Nothing will happen to you.
Hands up, uncle. -Hold on, let
me eat an apple before l die.
Hold on. Okay, shoot me.
Hands up, dad.
Okay, now its my turn.
Hands up. Please, don't shoot me.
Please.
Amar, shoot your father.
Bhaisahib!
-Rajpal!
Rajpal, what happened?
Rajpal! Rajpal!
l don't have a lot of time, my friend
Nothing will happen to you.
Promise me that you will take care of
Amar after me.... Rajpal!
No, my friend. RAjPAL!
Don't cry, my child. Once gone, the
dead people don't come back.
Besides, l am with you.
Dayashankar, l will keep an eye on
how long you keep this child under
your wing.
Kailasnath, l will never let either you
or your cruel plans even touch Amar.
l will fight against you and your cruel
intentions.
My child!
This girl is like an whirlwind. l have
told her several times to keep her
room clean, but she does not listen
at all.
Why are you grumbling so much, my
dear?
What else should l do? Not a single
thing is in place. l give up on Pooja.
ls this the same Pooja that made us
both suffer- you inside and me out
when she was born?
Even today l am suffering.
My darling wife, do you remember
when Pooja was very sick once? We
had prayed so much and were so
worried. Do you remember?
How can l forget? My dear little child
My poor little baby!
She was in so much pain.
My poor little baby!
You have spoilt her with your babying
Tomorrow when your baby marries
and goes to her in-laws, what will
they say?
They will say that she is
Dayashankar's daughter.
You will never change. You keep on
making money and she, spending it.
She must be blowing away money
somewhere for sure.
This much shopping is enough for
today, right? -Bye.
We will meet in jogger's park
tomorrow, don't forget.
Oooh, sorry!
Oh my God, run!
Hey! Where are you running off to?
Wait!
l won't let you off like that.
She has blackened my face.
Hey STOP! STOP!
Madam!
License! lts one way.
What happened?
Puncture! Shoot!
Here you go. Can l go now? Thank
you, thank you.
Where did she go?
She's become Mr. lndia.
Tire puncture!
Can you help me go home, my son?
Yes. Give me your luggage.
Wait here please.
Auto! Stop here. Come on.
No, no. That's the driver's seat. Sit in
the back, here.
My bag. God bless you.
Brother, where did that girl go?
Which girl?
The one who took my cane from me.
Auto, stop.
And then l broke both his eyes
Whose? His?
-No, his car's.
You mean headlights?
Yes, my tubelight.
Then he got real mad and turned
towards me and l socked him like this
Then?
Then l acted like l was blind
How?
like this.
A shopping bag in this hand and a
cane  in this hand...
Then l walked.... Son, take me to a
rickshaw, my son....
...and he....he....
Do you want a cab, eh? Who is going
to pay for my damages?
l will. But l don't have anything now.
l will pay you later.
No. l want repayment now.
l told you l will pay later.
No. l want it right now.
l will pay later.
Now we are even.
Pooja, lets go.
Yes.
Hello doll.
Hello.
Naina, lets go up.
Okay.
Oh, that's so cute.
Are you okay?
Yes.
lts so much fun. Are you frightened?
-No. lt's a lot of fun.
What a lovely feeling.
-Really!
Pooja!
Who is it?
lts your worshipper.
From which temple?
Not temple, l worship you.
Pooja, its me Vijay. So far l have
always succeeded in my endeavors.
But l will really succeed when l will
win over your affection.
l have seen a lot of people like you.
But you must not have seen someone
like me.
You are very insolent. Come, face me
you want to see me?
Hey, you worshipper...
Yes?
Who do you think you are? You must
be crazy. You have been stalking me
for a long time. ln a store, on the
phone. Now you have landed a plane
in the middle of the highway. This is
not your airfield. My car has been in
an accident and l have suffered a lot
of damages. l will report you to police
You blackened my face....
l will send you to jail.
No problem. Whatever had to happen
happened. What do we do now?
At least say bye to them.
Vikasmohan?
What number do you want?
-lt's a wrong number
l lost my money for no reason.
Can you please give the phone to the
girl? -What?
Yes, the one who is walking outside.
girl?
The blue one.
is there ever a blue girl?
Oh! Blue jeans, okay.
Madam! There's a call for you.
me? Call for me?
Speak fast, there are a lot of wrong
calls. Looks like we need an operator
Poojaji, did you recognize my voice?
YOu!How did you Call here?
l am very, very close to you.
What do you mean?
l am so close that you can't even
imagine it.
Really? l don't buy it.
Okay, Then try and test me.
Do one thing. Tell me that you love
me very much and then l will come to
you from the skies.
Oh really?
l love you.
Not like this, say lt loudly.
l LOVE YOu.
Here l am, here l am.
Oh my God! l have to take you to
meet auntie. l will kill me if we're late.
One, two, three........ten, eleven. l'll
hit him with all these shoes.
He promised me that he will sit and
eat fish curry and dessert with me.
Why does he also manage to fool me
so? l am hungry and he is still gone.
Mama Lucy...
Hi, sonny. Are you back?
You must be hungry.
Yeah.
Here you go. Take this and this and
this.
Where did this girl come from?
Who are you? And where is that
damn Vijay?
Mama, l am here.
Are you not ashamed of hiding
behind a female? Who is she?
She is Pooja, she is Mama.....
What Are you saying?
She is Pooja, she is Mama. She has
taken care of me throughout my life,
looked after me. l am her mother lndia
and she is my son of lndia.
l am her son of lndia and she is my
mother lndia.
You are cheating me with long tales.
Mama, she is the same one...
..she is so beautiful when she's shy...
She really looks like an angel.
This idiot has done something worth
while for the first time. l told him often
to bring home a bride, but he never
listened. What happened?
God bless you, my child. Why are
you staring at me? Pooja has come
here for the first time, give her
something sweet to eat.
Come here.
What Are you doing?
Giving you something sweet. Why
won't anybody let me do it?
Auntie, let me take your leave now.
do visit here sometimes.
Think of this as your own house.
Shut up.
When l had gone to your uncle's
house for the first time, he had given
me this. Now you keep it.
-Auntie, me....l...
Keep it, l will like you to have it.
its free, keep it.
Okay, l will leave now.
-Mama, l'll drop her....give you sweet
God, please make Pooja my
daughter-in-law soon.
Sir,sir...
Laxmi, why Are you shouting?
Sir, the young master is coming.
What?
Amar's coming?
But how do you know?
He was trying to phone you but it
was engaged, so he called me.
Oh... Parvati, Listen...
l am coming.
Amar is coming.
What?
Amar is coming...
-Amar is coming....
Pooja, come down soon....Amar is
coming.
Fantastic! Let him come. l will
welcome him in such a way that he
will remember it all his life.
Pooja should be coming.
Sir... Welcome... Congratulations...
Sir, You have grown so big...
Yes, But you Are still the same.
l had taken an oath that l will remain
same till you come back
so that you can recognize me.
ls everything alright?
Yes, everything is okay.
Pooja, what are you doing?
l am washing out his foreign influence
Now it's started.
What's going on Pooja. You haven't
left your childishness. Release him.
Poor boy got all wet. Released.....
They have grown up but they still act
and play like children.
Yes, you are right.
Okay, my foreign color got washed
out
Now what will happen to you?
No... No...
Give me a hand.
-Come on...
She ditched me...
There is no time value.
Are you upset?
-No... you have come only one hour
late. You could have come one more
hour late.
Okay, now tell me how do l look?
Amar brought it for me.
So...
Look at this chain. Amar got this one
too.
So...
Amar has brought me so many good
things like this bag, ear rings,
sunglasses, these shoes, this dress.
Everything. Amar brought it for me.
Then go to your Amar. What are you
doing here?
Vijay, What happened to you?
Okay, even l don't want to talk to you
ls she really going?
Pooja!
Tomorrow reach there on time and
don't praise Amar.
Okay, l won't. l love you.
-l love you.
Amar, have you chosen a girl for
marriage?
For who, you? Are you tired of auntie?
l am talking about you, not me.
l have selected her.
How is she?
Very beautiful.
Color?
Very fair.
Where is she from?
Local.
Then l will have to take my proposal
back.
May l ask you to name the girl of
your choice, uncle?
l can choose only one person and
her name is Pooja. -WHAT?
My son, if this is the case now, then
what will happen after marriage?
Parvati! Parvati!
l am here.
l am very happy today
why, What happened?
Amar has agreed.
really?
Yes. Now we will get them married in
a grand style.
l was waiting for this day. Now watch
how l dress my sweet little daughter
And my beautiful bride will start her
married life
Parvati, this house will become really
empty after Pooja moves away.
When you had married me and
brought me here, hadn't my parent's
house become empty?
a parent's happiness lies in the fact
that their daughter goes to her in-
laws house with dignity.
Good morning, dad.
Good morning, mom.
What traditions were you talking
about?
We were talking about you.
Then it must be definitely special.
You are absolutely right.
-Then tell me, don't wait.
Parvati, you tell her.
No. you tell her.
You want me to?
We have decided to get Amar and
you betrothed.
And even Amar has agreed to this
proposal. -Yes.
You decided between yourselves.
Didn't even try to find out my feelings
We don't need to know what you feel.
We know that you can never get a
better proposal than Amar in this
world.
How can you say that, dad? You
don't even know him.
At least meet him once.
Who, Vijay?
A simple pilot? You don't know a
thing about his family or his parents.
What can he give you?
All that that can make your daughter
happy for the rest of her life.
You are not in the right frame of mind
l fulfilled all your wishes. l dreamt big
dreams for you. And now you are
destroying all my dreams.
l will not let this happen. You will get
married to Amar only.
You will marry Amar only.
Hi Pooja, l...
Statue.
How dare you? Why did you say yes
to our marriage? l have loved you as
a good friend. What kind of a friend
are you?
l love someone else.
But you have messed everything up.
Don't stand still, say something.
Released.
That's it. uncle asked me and l said
yes. You have to respect elders.
There is nothing to get upset over. lf
you say so, l will say no to him.
Really?
Yes.
But at least tell me who is the lucky
guy that you love.
You want to meet him?
Of course.
Be ready tomorrow evening. l will
come and pick you up. Okay?
Thank you.
Thanks.
Statue!
Released.
You fell.
Statue!
You said so easily that you love
someone else. But you have forgotten
that friend from your childhood who
only wished for you. Pooja, how can
l live this life without you?
Come on...
Hello, where are you going? You act
like you know him already.
l don't know him but watch me, l will
recognize him in a glance.
Why just one shot, take a couple
more... three guesses, l mean
Okay, lets give it a try.
Yes.
Vijayji, greetings.
Greetings, my friend.
How do you know me? l am Vijay
Bannerjee.
l am looking for Vijay Mukherjee.
Sorry.
Come on.
-No no no.....
Hi Vijay.
What did you say?
Nothing, big brother.
Oh my God.
Pooja, you have to admit at my
guesswork that l recognized Amar.
Yes sir. l salute to your third glance.
Come, have a seat.
Pooja always talks about you.
Good or bad?
Obviously Good.
And you are much better than what
l had heard about you.
One vanilla milkshake for me.
Chocolate milkshake for me and him
She knows what l want.
and l know What he wants.
Someone should ask me what l want.
Big brother...
-Yes...
we have our brother over here
and with a beautiful girl
But who is the third person with this
girl?
Must be someone.
Even l am aching for her. lf l get her,
even l will celebrate Diwali.
We will. ln any case, we have a right
on our brother's property.
Where did you park your car?
its over there.
The driver parked it. Did you forget?
Yes, l forgot.
Oh oh! l forgot my lighter. You go on
ahead, l will be right back.
One of you was wishing that someone
should ask you what you want. So
here we go. What do you want, my
friends?
What have you come to give?
-Hold this. Here's your cold milkshake
Save him, save him, bring some water
Vijay is always like this. He is
always forgetting something or other
Pooja, l really liked your choice.
Really? l am very happy
But why is Vijay not here yet?
-He will. He's looking for his lighter.
ls he looking for it or making it?
Sorry, Sorry.
lt was under the table. l found it after
looking real hard.
Oh God! l forgot my glasses. l will be
back in two minutes.
Looks like it's a day for forgetting
things today. -l guess.
What's up? You were anxious to
celebrate Diwali? As a brother, l have
brought these flowers to share.
Then Give them.
He will come, don't worry.
l forgot my glasses at home.
Crazy.
What? When you are in, he's out.
And vice versa. Sometimes you
forget your lighter, and he his glasses
Either you both stay in or stay out.
Vijay, look at him. Amar, both have
disappeared.
Looks like there is something wrong
inside.
What have you done here?
-l haven't done a thing.
What are you doing here?
l was looking for both of you. Where
were you two?
lt doesn't matter now that you found
us. God know what you do.
You are Kailasnath's lions. And Amar
turned you into cotton in no time.
He was not alone. There was another
guy with him.
Where did this other person come
from?
Don't know, dad. But he was even
better than Amar.
l am trying to eliminate my enemies
and they keep on growing in numbers
Who is this new enemy?
How do l look?
this blue hat will go with it. Fantastic
l think this will go with it.
Amar, this white hat does not go.
The color does not match.
What are you talking? See this.
Amar, this is Rs. 2000, this is Rs.500
This is better.
Look at this border...
Excuse me. l like this one.
Lets fight some more...
We came out with bags instead of
a hat...
Why are you laughing?
Sister, don't cut from there, cut from
here. Like this. That's exactly how l
want them. She should look like
Miss World.
He's absolutely right, but you should
cut the hair at the back of her head
like this.
Amar, Are you crazy, talking stupid
things. This is how the hair.....
-Cut this hair like this.....
Shut up! Quiet!
you may Cut her hair your way.
l was waiting for you only.
How are you?
Okay.
Come. Lets play a game or two.
uncle, today l have come to ask you
for something.
What is it that you needed to ask me
for? All that is mine is yours.
l have a priceless treasure with me,
even that will be yours one day.
l am waiting for the day when Pooja
will go to your house as your bride.
That will be the happiest day of my
life.
uncle, even l want happiness. Not
for me, but for Pooja.
That's what we are giving her, my son
No, uncle. Pooja's happiness lies
with someone else, not me. And l
don't want to grab that from Pooja.
Amar...
Yes uncle. Pooja loves Vijay, not me
-She is very naive. lt's a mistake that
she is making. Vijay does not love
her. He is just using her as a ladder
to get to my wealth. l know it well.
No, uncle. Vijay is not that kind of
guy. l have met him.
You met him?
l've met him, l've judged him. And he
is really a right man for Pooja. And
as far as his financial situation goes,
we can get rid of that problem.
This cannot be possible, not at all...
-Please!
Listen to me. l always want to see
Pooja smiling, not with tears in her
eyes. Only Vijay can give her all the
laughter in the world, not me.
But, son....
uncle, Please.
You have called me a son, then listen
to your son.
Okay. My happiness is in your
happiness.
Vijay sahib, do come in. You...
Where is your sir?
He is not home yet.
He calls me over and disappears
himself.
lf he called you, then he will come
definitely.
Please have a seat, l will bring you a
nice hot cup of tea.
No, l will drink it with your sir.
As you wish.
Tell me, your sir lives all alone in this
big house.
No, l also live with him.
Married or not?
Even l wish That l should have a
beautiful wife, who will cook hot food
for me, sing a lullaby for me....
l am not talking about your marriage,
l am talking about your sir.
He used to love a lot, he was also
supposed to get married..
To whom?
Laxmi, Who Are you talking about?
l was talking about me. You have a
seat, l will bring tea.
Hi.
Hi Vijay. Sorry, l was a little late.
The traffic is as slow as the speed in
the pace of life.
A lot of times you have to change
roads to get home. Lets go in the bar
Amar, do you think of me as a friend?
Any doubt?
Yes, l doubt a lot. lf you thought of
me like that, then you would not hide
anything from me.
Hide what?
just That you were in love with some
one, were supposed to get married...
What happened? Did she cheat you?
No, not her. The circumstances
cheated us.
Who was she? Won't you tell me her
name?
No, my friend. Now that she belongs
to someone else, l can't reveal it.
Anyway, forget this. l had almost
forgotten why l called you.
Here you go.
What is this?
Read it and sign it. From today you
are the director of Rajpal Aviation's.
And also a chief engineer as well.
What?
Amar, such a big obligation....
now you Are forgetting, Vijay. you
call me a friend on one side and talk
about gratitude on the other.
But Amar..... -There is no
gratitude among friends. Congrats.
My god. You look beautiful. l can't
believe that l am handing you over to
someone else. Maybe l will have to
change my plans.
l was just joking.
Auntie, what are you doing here?
Why don't you come inside?
No, l am okay here.
Today, l am announcing Pooja's
engagement with Vijay Khanna.
On this occasion l ask for you to
bless this couple.
What's the matter? You look very
upset.
Yes, l wanted to send some important
documents to Cochin and pilots have
striked today. lt will be a loss of
thousands.
l will carry them for you, if you don't
mind.
l had almost forgotten that you are a
pilot. Are you free?
Don't worry. lts only a half hour flight.
l will be back in an hour.
Here is the file.
When do l have to take it?
Right now.
Which one, the blue one?
Yes, your work is done.
l am losing altitude.
Bring the plane in control.
Doctor, l don't understand what is the
matter?
As your family doctor, l should not
hide anything from you.
Your daughter is pregnant.
Pooja, my child, you made such a big
mistake in your youth. This will only
lead to destruction for you and us.
Parvati, our daughter is very under-
standing. She will not do anything
that will damage us and make me
ashamed to even face myself in the
mirror. Pooja, you will have to abort
this baby.
Dad, no. Life has stolen my love from
me. Now please don't tell me to lose
his last memory also. Please dad.
You stupid girl. The baby that you call
the memory of your love is going to be
called a bastard by this world. And
Dayashankar will not allow this.
This formula also backfired.
Come on Pooja, lets go for a drive.
-l don't want to go.
Why not?
Leave me alone.
Leave you alone? No way. l am your
friend.
l can feel your pain. l also know that
one can tolerate their own pain. But
if it affects others, then it is easier to
share it with others.
Amar, some heartaches cannot be
shared with others. My parents want
me to give up Vijay's last gift of love.
Gift of love?
Yes. l am pregnant with his child.
Now you tell me, who will share this
with me?
l will share it with you.
l will give me name to this child. l will
marry you.
She is waiting for you. Bye.
Pooja, we might be husband and wife
in the eyes of the world. But l will not
do anything that will break your heart.
Dayashankar has played such a sixer
by marrying his daughter with my
nephew. The ball is completely out
of the field for us now.
Daddy, l can't even see the ball. lf l
saw the ball, then l will run him out.
l mean, kill him.
Then there will not be any hindrance
for us.
You be quiet. Amar will not just die.
he will leave a child in his wake and
then the inheritance will go to the
child.
What should we do?
Sometimes l feel that you are not my
children. lf l had to kill Dayashankar,
l would have killed him before. He is
very cunning and we will have to think
twice before every step.
Here you go.
No No No.
Look, you have to eat. Remember,
you've someone else eating with you.
See you.
one minute.
Be careful. Slowly.
Sir, you have a phone call.
tell them That l am busy.
Sir, its urgent. lts from your home.
Sir, you have become the child of a
cute little father. l mean you have
become the father of a cute little baby.
Hi. How are you?
l am fine.
That's great. Where is the child.
over there.
He looks just like you.
lf my child doesn't look like me, then
who will he look like? Right?
Sshh! Pooja!
l am coming.
What did l know?
did you get your father wet?
Come on the horse. Come on.
Mom, l will become a pilot.
you will Not become a pilot, okay?
Laxmi, put this in my briefcase.
Where is the briefcase?
Downstairs.
Daddy, mom will not let me become
a pilot.
Why not? You can become whatever
you want. lf you want to become a
pilot, then that's what you will be.
uncle, where is Auntie Lucy who used
to stay here?
The poor woman passed away. When
her son Vijay was killed in an plane
accident, she couldn't absorb the
shock and died.
Drink your milk.
-Hold on mama....
You can do this later. Drink your milk
first.
You drink half....come on, drink. You
have become so thin.
Now l know why you never answered
my letters. You brought up an orphan
like me with so much love and now
you have left me alone. Very nice.
Do you want to meet anyone?
Pooja used to live here.
My sir's daughter. She got married
and moved away.
Even she did not wait for me. Mama
also left me alone.
Who are you?
Your death.
Are you Vijay?
Tell me, who tried to kill me.
Tell me, who tried to kill me. Say it.
This is the same car that was involved
in the Mishra accident.
Don't trouble your teacher, learn
carefully.
Send the car on time for lunch, it
was late yesterday.
Bye Rahul. Remember to bring his
history book today. Bye.
She couldn't wait for even a little
while.
Hello, who is this idiot on the line?
Pooja, l am Amar. Why are you so
upset?
You...oh nothing...
l called to tell you that l have a
meeting tonight. l will be late.
Try to come early.
l will, But lt will be atleast midnight.
Midnight?
Yes, you eat your dinner and sleep.
Okay.
Bye.
Midnight!
Toady my love has broken all barriers
and made you mine.
After seeing you after so long, l felt
like l got my life.
You said so easily that you love some
one else. Wish l could tell you how
much l love you. How can l live
without you?
That means that l was the barrier. By
breaking that, you stole Pooja from
me. Amar, l realized today, that your
friendship was all fake. You tried to
kill me but l have come as your death
today. l will make your life hell.
Fire! Fire! Laxmi uncle, there is a fire
Hurry up.
Bring water, quick!
What?
the cottage is on fire. Please hurry.
Okay, l will be right there.
You said so easily that you like Vijay.
Wish l could tell you how much l love
you. From childhood till today.
Pooja how can l live without you.
After seeing Pooja after a long time
today, it felt like l got my life. l can
hardly wait for the day when you will
come to my house as my bride.
But when l found out, l think l lost you
You loved me so much without letting
me know. You always tried to look
out for my happiness and l gave you
grief. Your love is great and you are a
great person. l bow to you and your
love.
Amar, what happened?
Nothing.
No my son, it's a lot.
The murderer had your name on this
bullet.
Kailasnath! Kailasnath!
Why am l scared, this is my house.
Even a dog acts like a lion in his area
Dayashankar, why are you screaming
like that in a decent man's house?
l am not deaf.
You may not be deaf but you are
definitely dumb. You have always
acted slyly. You killed Rajpal and
now you tried to kill Amar?
Amar? l cannot do such an evil thing
to my nephew. No, no.
Only you can do such a thing. Do you
remember what l had said at Rajpal's
funeral? Even the shadow of your
misdeeds will not touch our Amar.
Your Amar? Since when did he
become your Amar? You should be
grateful to me that you are still alive,
only because we have no enmity.
You were Rajpal's enemy.
l killed my brother, not a stranger. lt
is a family matter. After his death, l
should have received the inheritance.
But due to you, l lost it. You started
running everything only because you
were his friend.
You were his enemy, not his brother.
And l was his friend as well as his
brother. l had promised him that
nobody will steal Amar's inheritance.
Sometimes you have to sacrifice your
life to keep your promise.
Are you threatening me?
No, l am giving you advice. Your best
interests are in you packing your bag
and leaving this place. Let Lord
Shankar help you.
lf you stay here, you will die. Because
in our family, there will be always be
a lot of bloodshed.
Kailasnath, you missed your aim. But
now l have written your name on this
bullet. The next time this bullet leaves
my gun, l will not miss my aim.
Daddy, why was Dayashankar
barking at us?
Now you come, you idiots. l love and
feed you more than my dogs and yet
you can't even bark, if not bite.
Tell me, did you fire at Amar?
No.
Did you?
No.
That's amazing. lf none of us fired at
him, then who was it?
The sky fell down and there was a
disaster. Dayashankar's factory has
been destroyed.
l had not even hissed venomously at
him and this happened. What l could
not do in twenty years, this person
has done it in twenty minutes.
Looks like Dayashankar has got a
new enemy.
New enemy? What do you mean?
You idiot. We are already his enemies
right? But we haven't done this. l feel
like kissing whoever did this job.
Mr. Commissioner, we are incurring
a lot of destruction. And you people
are just trying. l don't want tryouts, l
want you to catch the criminal.
Don't worry at all. Wherever he is, he
will be caught soon.
Hello, who is speaking?
your destruction.
Don't be stupid, who are you?
l fired at you, you didn't know it. Your
factory was burnt down, you didn't
know. Don't be silly, Amar. Very soon
you will find out my identity.
Whose phone was it, son?
the same man Who destroyed us.
Now catch it.
Mommy, look what l found.
What did you find? Let me see.
Lighter. This is Vijay's lighter.
My lighter had gone under the table
hence l had to look for it.
Mama, l have written so many letters
to Pooja and you, but you two never
wrote back. When l was going to
Cochin, my plane caught fire suddenly
l was saved by God's grace. The
fishermen saved my life. l was
unconscious for many years. When l
regained consciousness, l tried to get
in touch with you. But unfortunately,
l was unable to walk and hence l felt
ashamed. Their leader took good care
of me and now l am able to walk. l am
coming. l want to get even with the
person who did this to me. Yours Vijay
NOOOO! You all cheated me. You
all lied to me.
Pooja, what are you doing?
Get out of my sight!
What happened Pooja? Why are you
crying?
Don't touch me!
You have blood on your hands. You
are a murderer!
What? Are you in your senses?
l wasn't before, but now l am. Vijay
did not die, he was killed. By none
other than you. Here, read this.
You sent Vijay away on an excuse so
you could kill him. You sabotaged his
plane and put him out of your way.
Why? Why did you do it?
l had thought of you as my friend. You
showed me sympathy and gave me
so much grief. Why? just to win me?
No. You are misjudging me. lf Vijay
is alive, then it is a happy news for all
lt is good news only for me. You must
be very sad with it.
Where is Vijay, Pooja? l want to
meet him.
Who do you want to meet? The one
who is after your blood?
l am not afraid of death. l am sad
because both of you misjudged me.
You still haven't got rid of your mask.
You played with our lives and yet you
are..... l cannot stay with a selfish
man like you. l feel suffocated. l am
leaving and l will not be coming back
to this house again.
A daughter comes to in-laws house
after marriage and only leaves it when
she dies.
You are right, father. Please kill me
so that l don't have to live with a
murderer. Please kill me.
Who are you talking about?
The same man who is standing as
my husband in front of me.
Who has he killed?
my love.
You mean Vijay?
Vijay is alive, daddy.
Vijay can escape death once, not
again and again. -Daddy!
Amar is not Vijay's killer.
Then who is it? Tell me so that l can
kill him. He has destroyed his life.
Then kill me.
Daddy, you?
Yes. l am Vijay's killer.
Why? You knew that Pooja never
loved me. l can't believe that you
played with Vijay's life like that. uncle,
l had told you that l can't bear to see
tears in Pooja's eyes. lnspite of all
that, you killed everybody's happiness
for my sake. Why?
You want to know? Then listen.
Whatever l am today is due to Amar's
father and my friend, Rajpal. l had
promised Rajpal when he died that
Amar's well-being and his happiness
will be my life's aim. You started
loving Vijay and Amar sacrificed his
happiness for yours. But l couldn't let
that happen. Hence, l sacrificed your
happiness by planning to kill Vijay.
And not just that, but l also hid all of
Vijay's letters about his survival from
you. Because Dayashankar would do
anything to maintain the promise
given to his friend.
Pooja!
Let me die, l want to die.
Life has brought me at such an uneven
crossroad today. On one side is my
husband who has helped and
comforted me. On the other side is
love who is screaming for justice.
You tell me what l should do.
l don't know, Pooja. Life is always
testing us and we never know when.
All l know is that l have and will
always be your friend. This is our test
and we will pass it together. We will
get out of this.
You stay here and l will be back with
your teddy.
Come soon.
l will. Give me a kiss.
Mommy! Mommy!
Rahul, my child! Rahul. Save my son!
Take care of him. His father will come
out to save him.
Now will start the fight between the
snake and the mongoose.
Tell Kailasnath that if Amar does
not show up, then kill the child.
l want my son. l can't live without him
Daddy, please find him for me.
Have some faith, nothing will happen
to Rahul. lf Rahul gets hurt....
Yes, l am Amar. Have you found out
anything about Rahul?
You will know about him. First listen
to me. A few years ago, you had
traded my life. You won't live long for
that. Anyway, you will die when you
realize that your son is in my hands.
-Listen to me.....
You listen to me. Your time to talk
has expired and its time l spoke. lf
you wish to save your child, then
come to Madh island before twelve
tomorrow. Or else l will send your
son's pieces parceled to your house.
And yes, you wanted to know who l
am...your old friend Vijay.
What's the matter Pooja? Are you
surprised to see me alive?
You think you are alive. But you can't
be the Vijay that l was so devastated
to lose. You just have his body, not
his soul. His soul is not as evil as you
You are right. l am evil, but why?
Because you have lost your shame.
You called yourself a living dead body
at my death. Do you remember that
a dead person is buried and not
married? ln our society, people grieve
on someone's death. They do not
celebrate for a few days. But you went
and got married. Aren't you not
ashamed of yourself? Did you not
have faith in me? Was that love fake?
You are evil, not me. Your soul has
no morals.
Did you finish what you had to say?
lf there is anything left, say that too.
l want to see how much venom you
have in you.
What do you want to say? That l am
lying? That it does not mean a thing?
Yes, it does not mean a thing. And
you say that because you are a man
who sins, but the woman has to bear
the consequences of that. l was the
same depressed woman with a
burden. Amar not only married me
but also gave me a power to feel
myself alive today.
Wow, Pooja. You are a real lndian
wife. You will do anything to maintain
your husband's image, no matter how
evil he is.
Beware, Amar is....
How can he give life to anyone? He
plays with others life for his own
happiness. He tried to kill me to win
you. l was lucky that l did not die.
But not even God can save him.
Are you crazy?
Yes, l am Crazy. l am Crazy. l am
burning in my own misery. lts your
Amar's fault. He tried to kill me. Vijay
became Devaa due to your Amar. l
will kill him and his son.
You cannot do that!
-l will do exactly that!
Okay, then go and kill the memory of
our love.
What do you mean?
l am telling the truth. Rahul is your
son. Your own blood.
Pooja, you are lying?
No. And the person that you are
calling your murderer, he does not
even know who planned this.
Yes. Even l doubted him at first until
l realized that he is innocent. Had
Amar not been there then, l would
have either committed suicide or l
would have ended up in some bad
part of town with a bad reputation.
Amar did not just give me a life, he
gave your son his name and a right
to respectability in society. And here
you are, trying to kill such a nice man
What have l done?
l thought that my savior was my
murderer. Pooja, who had planned
my death?
My daddy.
But why?
Amar had somehow convinced him
about our wedding, but he couldn't
forget his old promise to his friend.
Enough Pooja. After hearing all this,
l have started hating myself.
There is not much time. l will have to
go there before sunrise.
Vijay, listen to me. Vijay!
Vijay, l have come. Vijay.
Nephew, l have also come here.
Where is Vijay? Where is my son,
Kailasnath?
You will get him. You forgot your
relations in caring for your son. After
all, l am your uncle.
Evil people like you can never be
anyone's uncles.
You are stubborn and stupid just like
your father. l wanted to be near him,
but he went near God. He wouldn't
come close to me at all.
l don't want to hear your garbage.
just give me my child.
Daddy! Daddy!
-Rahul!
Kailasnath, if anything happens to
my son, l will not let you live.
You like to trouble kids right? Now
see how l take you for a spin.
Come here my child.
l want to go to My daddy.
l am your daddy.
l want My daddy.
l am your daddy.
Not you, l want My daddy.
l will take you to your Daddy.
Rahul, my son. Are you all right?
Yes daddy.
Kailasnath!
Pooja, l can't bear to see tears in
your eyes. l always want to see you
happy.
Nothing will happen to you, my son.
Amar, let me take you to the hospital
Vijay, l am returning your love to you.
Forgive me Amar. l am really
ashamed of myself.
lt's not your fault, Vijay. lt's fate. You
got your Vijay. Today my wish is
fulfilled. Are you going to send off
your childhood friend in tears?
No Amar, l will not let you go. Statue!
You are my childhood friend. l am
going to need you at every step of my
life. Amar, you cannot leave me in
between. Released. Released Amar.
Amar, l only loved Pooja. But you
have also worshipped Pooja in such
a way that even the angels will bow
before you.
