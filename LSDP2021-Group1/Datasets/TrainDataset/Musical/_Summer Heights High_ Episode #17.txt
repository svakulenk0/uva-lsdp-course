I've got Year 9s first period.
God help me.
Mmm.
With the blonde hair?
What are you doing today?
Um... today.
Tonight I was in a movie.
One of my big gripes
is there's a lot of teasing
that goes on at this school.
Kids are very nasty. And Toby
deals with a lot of that stuff.
He has to deal with being called,
"You spaz".
"You retard". "Spastic".
Um, what else do you get?
"Nuff nuff".
And I know how he feels.
I had a difficult school time myself.
I went to an all-boys school, and
I went by my real name in those days,
which is Helen -
the ancient Greek
masculine version of the name.
And you can imagine
at at boys' school,
with a name like Helen Gregson,
it was not easy.
Getting called things. " Oh, you big poof,
Helen. You 're a poofter."
And I used to wear my pants
fairly high in those days
'cause I was a dancer and...
Pretty funny.
Mmm.
Dance... that's just how
we wore them then.
So, " Helen, stop pulling
your pants up, you big poof."
Nasty things like that.
So I know how it feels.
Yes. We look after each other,
don't we?
Yeah.
We do.
Just... Alright.
And release.
Did you lock the car?
Course I fucking locked it.
Don't talk to me
like that, you little fuck.
Don't walk next to me. It looks gay.
So is he back on the Ritalin?
Yeah.
OK. Well, that can help.
And, Jonah, have you had time
to think things over
during the suspension?
Answer your teacher.
He's not my teacher,
he's student welfare.
Any sort of changes
that you could make?
Be better at school.
And be more behaved.
What about at home,
Mr Takalua?
Is there anything you can change
to help Jonah get through all this?
Be stricter on him.
Make him do his work.
And smack him out if he doesn't.
Well, not really changes like that.
I was thinking more of doing some
reading together in the evenings.
Yeah, maybe.
That's a homo thing to do.
I'm not doing that, sir.
Alright, what about the work
you were supposed to do
during your suspension?
Jonah, what subject was this for?
I don't know.
Well, what teacher gave it to you?
Mr Poulos.
The science teacher.
Yeah.
We went and buy the glue for it
and he works hard on it.
Yeah, I can see he worked hard on it.
But I'm afraid to tell you
this is not school work.
A suspension isn't a holiday, Jonah.
Do you really wanna go to
a fourth school in two years?
No, sir.
No, I didn't think so.
Holly. Oh, my God.
Did you get my text?
Is it a formal issue?
Formal issue. Guys, formal issue.
So, the DJ called me last night
and says there's no way he's doing it
unless we give him
full payment up-front.
Yeah, it's, like, five grand.
So just tell him we don't have it.
I told him. He got really mad.
It's a serious issue, guys.
It's, like, the biggest part of it.
When I said I was gonna plan a formal
I didn't realise that you guys
would be too povo to pay for it.
We've sold, like, three tickets.
I know.
So, as of today, Jonah,
we're gonna implement some changes.
You are now on parole.
That means one tiny thing and
there are big, big consequences.
And first of all, we're gonna
ban you from breakdancing,
because breakdancing is the cause
of a lot of your issues.
That's bullshit, sir.
Jonah, every time you get into
a fight, it's about breakdancing.
It's a waste of time.
It's fucked up.
One time you get caught breakdancing
and you are out of here.
Well, if he fucks up again
I'm gonna send him back to Tonga.
How would you feel about that, Jonah?
I'd feel bad.
I don't wanna go to Tonga.
I'd miss my friends.
I'll miss this school.
Mmm.
I went to Tonga once
when I was 10, and it was shit.
Alright. So don't break the rules.
Do you understand that?
Yeah.
Good.
How about, um... just an idea -
we could, like,
maybe buy our own tickets.
No, we are not
buying our own tickets.
We're on the formal committee.
We've done so much work.
Yeah, we've done way too much work.
No way.
Oh, my God. I just
thought of an idea.
What?
We could do, like, a fundraiser.
I've done heaps of it.
I know what to do.
No, seriously, like, we'll do,
like, a dress-up day -
like, a theme dress-up day, right?
And everyone has to bring, like, $2.
It will be so cool.
Five bucks.
Five bucks!
And five bucks times the whole school
is, like, 20,000 bucks or something.
And we could do
a fashion parade.
Like, $10 at the door.
I love fashion parades!
And we'll do... like, we'll set up
a little catwalk in a classroom.
And I can bring in all my designer
clothes and you guys can wear them!
Yeah!
That's, like, paid for our formal.
Let's go tell Mr Cameron.
Oh, my God.
I'll do an announcement at assembly.
It will be so cool.
Thank you, Rosie.
Pop those down there.
Greg, could I have a word with you
in my office, if you wouldn't mind?
Yes.
I'm sorry to hear about your dog.
It's obviously quite upsetting.
Yes, it is.
The reason I want to talk to you
is to tell you that
Meredith's finalised
all her family affairs
in New Zealand
and she'll be here on Friday.
As what?
As head of drama.
We don't need a head of drama.
I'm the director of performing arts.
You have been outstanding -
I can't thank you enough for filling in,
and I'll be putting something
in the newsletter - but Meredith...
No, I'm the director
of performing arts.
Look, Meredith will be back
as the head of drama
and you 'll be returning
to being a senior drama teacher.
When am I getting my arena seating...
for the show?
When are you... when are you...
...opening up your budget and giving
a little bit to Drama for once?
When am I getting... when am I
getting my basketball hoop down?
When am I getting
some support from you?
Instead, you 're wasting it
on sport and cricket stumps
and stupid things
that the school doesn't need.
Why don't you go buy some more books
for the library or crap like that?
Because the funds are certainly not
coming in my direction.
Greg, don't be ridiculous.
I am greatly supportive of you
and I've appreciated
all that you 've done.
You 're not a supporter of me.
You don't support me.
If you supported me,
you wouldn't have the special ed kids
in the demountables
on the site where you know
I want to build
the Gregson Performing Arts Centre.
That's not supportive.
Greg, I have to consider
other departments in the school,
and, from where I stand,
Drama is a small department.
Well, you need to give me
a chance to make it big.
Once I've finished the show,
then build the performing arts centre.
The kids will be coming in droves,
you know that.
And I need your help.
I don't need... Meredith.
Greg, I understand
what you 're saying,
but I've been in the public school
system for over 30 years now
and I know what the funding is like.
Your performing arts centre
is a fabulous idea,
but it is not realistic.
It's never going to happen.
Let me do my show
and I will get you that money.
I need you to help me
instead of putting up walls.
I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do.
I'm so sick of you. I'm so...
I'm sick of this stupid school.
And you 're all pathetic.
I've built that drama department up
from the shithole that it was
when I came here
and you 've never... you 've never
appreciated me for doing that.
You 've never thanked me.
You 've never said, " Greg,
thank you for what you 've done."
You know, I could have taken
a different road.
I could have been huge by now if I'd
taken a different path in my life.
I could have been famous.
I would have been massive.
Instead I've just chosen to
waste my time in a pathetic school
with loser teachers
and idiots like you.
And I'm so sick of it.
You 're pathetic. I'm better than
all of you people out there.
I'm better than all of you.
I try to bring a little bit of hope,
a little bit of magic into the school
and I get a...
I try to have a dream.
I dare to have a dream that's big
and you shove it in my face.
I get it slapped back in my face.
"No, it's not possible.
We can't do that."
Shoot me for wanting to... to dream.
Shoot me for giving the kids
something to aspire to.
I'm bloody resigning.
I'm so sick of it.
Shove it up your arse, Margaret.
I'm resigning, everyone.
I'm out of here. That's it. I'm gone.
There's my letter of resignation.
And there's some flowers
for my dead dog.
Why don't you stick those
up your fat arse?!
Fuck off, everyone!
I'm gone.
We got kicked out
of our old area.
Now we're in this shit area.
Yeah, we've got a fucked-up ground.
There's no audience
when we breakdance.
No-one ever comes down here.
It's so boring, man.
Come on, man.
I can't do it.
Come on, no teachers
can see from here.
I'll get busted if I do it.
Since the fight, like, we don't even
talk to the Year 7 s anymore, man.
We don't even... it's like they
don't... they're not even there, bro.
We don't even look at them.
Especially Keiran.
He's a fucker.
He made up
this all-Aussie crew
and he's going around telling people
that his crew's better than us.
It's crap.
Bro, he's racist.
He only lets Aussies in it.
And Aussies are shit breakdancers.
Bloody Aussies.
The All-Aussie Breakdancing Crew's
made up of me, Liam
and a couple of other guys
I'm teaching breakdance.
The only rule is that
you have to be Aussie to be in it,
so no wogs or fobs.
And our year level coordinator,
Miss Wheatley,
said we can breakdance
at the end-of-term assembly.
So we're practising.
Hi, miss!
Oh, man, when Jonah
was away, the Year 7 s,
they wrote all this racist shit
on Jonah's locker.
Yeah, like, "Go home, fobs,"
and shit like that.
Keiran wrote it.
And saying, "Go back to Samoa."
Keiran fucking wrote it.
He's denying it, but he wrote it.
No, it wasn't us. We don't know
who did it, but. It wasn't us, but.
They probably did it themselves
to make it look like we did it.
Yeah. They're stupid enough
to do that.
And I know if I take revenge on him
and smash him or some shit,
that I'll get busted for it.
I'll get blamed for it
and then I'll have...
... I'll get fucking expelled
or some shit.
And now for a quick message
from Jamie King.
I'm just about
to make my announcement
about the fundraiser for the formal.
I've done heaps of
this kind of stuff before
and the key thing is
to make people feel really guilty.
AIDS is a huge problem in Africa.
People are dying
of AIDS every second.
It's really bad.
So on Thursday we'll be having
a dress-up day
to raise important funds
for AIDS in Africa.
Going with the AIDS thing
means that people are more likely
to give money,
'cause they're gonna feel really bad.
Like, if I just said it was for
the formal, like, they wouldn't care.
Do you know what I mean?
The dress-up theme is AIDS, so come
dressed as an AIDS-related thing,
like a doctor, a nurse,
a patient or an African.
Also there's gonna be
a fashion parade
in the multipurpose room at lunch,
and it's $10 to get in.
Thank you, everyone.
I don't really
see it as lying.
It's, like, just delaying
telling them the truth about it.
Do you know what I mean?
Well, I'm leaving
at the end of today.
I'm really going. I'm ready.
Can you make sure we're going
in some sort of order with this?
I'm doing
the whole farewell thing.
Guys, I'm gonna be
handing round my card.
I've got the whole staff
signing one of those...
that I went and got at recess
from the newsagent.
The card's on its way round, so...
What are you gonna write?
So everyone's wishing me well,
which is very nice.
Sorry, I don't know you very well.
Can I get you to sign this, please?
Um, everyone's talking about it.
There's a lot of talk
around the school.
Listening, please, everyone.
It is my last day today -
Mr G's last day at school -
so if you have anything
you want to say to me
then come and talk to me now
in the playground - here.
I've let the whole school know.
Um, I've said goodbye
to good friends.
OK, off you go.
I've gone around
to my favourite teachers.
I'm not gonna say goodbye to
everyone - I don't like everyone.
Go and get the rubbish.
No, Mr G.
The show's off.
I'm not doing the show anymore.
My artistic integrity was being
tampered with way too much.
Rodney's organised one of those
farewell, walkout, guard of honour
sort of things, um...
...which is compulsory
for all the drama kids to go to,
so there should be
a fairly big turnout for that.
Thank you. Thanks. 'Bye, everyone.
Who's creamed the car?
Has anyone creamed the car? No.
See you, mate.
Yeah, see ya. Good.
But I've just...
I've reached the end of my tether.
I've come to the end.
And it feels right.
Goodbye, Summer Heights High, forever.
Hi.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God, you 're so hot!
Yeah, I'm, like,
a naughty AIDS nurse.
I thought you said
we all had to be African.
Yeah, I didn't want
anyone else to copy.
Yeah, we just came
from the lockers, though,
and not everyone's got into it.
No. They still have to pay
the five bucks, though.
Jonah. Jonah should be
the only one at the computer, Leon.
Miss!
Leon needs to finish his own story.
To be honest,
I'm a bit worried about Jonah.
He seems, um... a little withdrawn
and... and unhappy.
Doug's taking this
really hard line with him
and I'm just not quite sure
that it's the right approach.
How are you going there, mister?
Alright, miss.
He's losing confidence.
I just worry sometimes that we, as
a school, aren't doing him much good.
The last day of term
is Gumnut story day.
So I hope that everybody
sent their notes home.
Why do we have to call it
Gumnut Cottage Story Day?
That's... it means nothing.
It's an insult to me.
I forgot that you were
such a man now, Jonah.
Maybe you want to work on a new title,
something that's more manly.
What about Gumnut Cottage
Wicked Day?
Yeah!
Yeah!
Guys, AIDS money. AIDS in Africa.
Did you guys bring your money?
It doesn't matter if you didn't
wear casuals, you still pay.
Thanks a lot.
Hello. How are you?
Hi. Good.
Have you got five bucks?
Yeah.
Yep.
Oh, you came as a lesbian.
That looks cool.
Thanks.
It kinda relates. Like, gay - AIDS.
It's just my casual stuff really.
Oh, cute!
Hi, girls.
Mr Cameron, can I check
your heart rate?
You all look great.
Only joking.
Appreciate what you 're doing, girls.
This is for a great cause.
Thanks, Mr Cameron.
We are making so much money.
This is gonna pay for it easy.
Remember that on story day
there's no school uniform,
but I want you all to dress well.
I want you all
to look like gentlemen.
OK, which means, Leon...
...which means collared shirts,
long pants.
And I want your hair done.
Gumnut Cottage Story Day
happens once a year.
I don't even have a collared shirt.
Well, borrow one, Jonah.
The boys write and publish
their own stories during the term.
Some of their families have never
ever seen them or heard them read,
and so suddenly there they are
reading their own stories
in front of an audience.
I have to say
that I always end up in tears.
Miss, how come
I can't use spellcheck?
'Cause if you use spellcheck
you 'll never learn how to spell.
Don't read it, miss.
Uh, it's alright.
Hands off the screen.
What the Year 7 s wrote
on Jonah's locker was horrible.
It was really, really hurtful.
I really felt for him.
It's really fantastic
that Jonah's not retaliating.
That's been really,
really good of him.
I think he's being very brave.
Fuck off, miss.
I'm not.
Don't.
Sorry for saying "fuck off".
Just... finish up.
Go away, miss.
Trust me for once.
I do, I do!
Hey, girl. Girls.
Girls, come over. It's me.
It's Mr G.
I'm a teacher. Come over.
Is Mrs Cotton back yet?
Is everyone freaking out
that I'm not there?
Can you guys go back in and spread it
that I'm out the front?
Tell everyone. Thanks.
Um... Mr G, Miss Murray would like
to see you in her office.
She told me to get you.
Miss Murray?
How does she know I'm here?
She says she can see you
driving past from her office.
Well, tell Miss Murray
that if she wants to talk to me
she can come to me.
Go and tell her that.
$10, thanks.
Hi. Do you have your $10? Thank you.
You 're supporting AIDS.
Everyone in position.
Oh, my God, everyone's there.
I'm so nervous.
Are you guys ready?
Um, I'm gonna go last.
Hi, everyone.
Welcome to Fashion Parade.
No, you go last.
This is a Dolce & Gabbana dress
that I wore to my Year 9 formal.
As you can see, it still fits me.
This is an outfit
that I might wear on the weekend
if I'm just going to the shops
for something.
It's very casual yet very now.
And remember, guys, bigger donations
will be accepted.
Do it for the Africans.
Right, you go...
first you go knuckle,
doosh, doosh, doosh, doosh, doosh.
The whole point is
that if he doesn't breakdance
we're gonna be named
as the shitholers.
And if he does breakdance
and get caught he's gonna get...
He's not gonna get caught, because
no teachers go behind the gym.
We got a text message
from Keiran last period.
Sent it to Joseph's phone,
and he said he wants to
battle Jonah after school.
He wants to have
a breakdancing challenge.
He's gonna go round school saying
I'm not a good enough breakdancer.
But the whole school already knows
you 're not a good breakdancer.
I have to fucking do it, bro.
Don't do it, man.
If he doesn't do it then they'll go,
"Oh, there's that shit crew.
"There's Jonah and his shit crew.
"They didn't even wanna
battle Keiran."
I'm supporting him, youse are not.
If he gets expelled,
what are you gonna do then?
What if Keiran
tips off the teachers?
He's probably setting you up
right now, man.
What do you want me to do, boys -
just ignore the shit?
Don't do it.
I have to do it.
What the fuck do you know about it?
You know I'm a good breakdancer.
I could beat... I could
squash that little homo
with one little fucking move.
Everyone knows
you 're the best.
Text him back, Joseph.
Say I'll meet him at
the back of the gym after school.
Bro, this is fucked, man.
Do it.
Do it.
Fucking do it.
You 're fucking yourself
up, though, man.
Greg.
Hello.
Hi there.
I've noticed you parked here.
I'm just wondering how you 're
getting on and so on.
Good. Fine.
Just... just on my way to the shops.
Do you mind if I get in?
Because...
Yeah, that's alright.
I'd actually like you
to reconsider your resignation.
Well, that's very interesting,
but that won't be happening.
Well, look,
why don't we just pretend
that all of this didn't happen?
You can just step back into it.
I don't even need to
process your letter.
Well, that would be very convenient
for you, wouldn't it? No paperwork.
Greg, what I'd like you to do
is to think it through.
You 've rushed into this.
I've thought it through.
I don't think you have.
I know exactly what I'm doing.
I've been disrespected and mistreated
and shoved around, and I'm...
... I've made up my mind,
I'm not coming back to teach.
So forget it.
Well, look, as you know, Meredith
started again from leave today...
... and she and I believe
that you need a better title.
If you 're willing to come back,
I'd like to give you the title
of creative coordinator
of the drama department.
Don't patronise me, Margaret.
That is a pathetic title.
Just get on with your life.
I'm getting on with mine.
Getting on with your life?
Why have you spent all day driving
up and down outside the school?
Because it's on my way to the shops.
I do have a life outside
Summer Heights High, believe it or not.
Alright, Greg, if that's your attitude,
I can't do any more,
but if you want to change your mind,
you know where I am.
Fine.
OK.
Fine.
See you, then.
How are the kids getting on with
the... cancelling the production?
Are they upset?
We haven't cancelled the production.
It's going ahead.
Well, I told you to cancel it.
No, I'm sorry, we're not gonna waste
a great production like that.
Meredith's going to direct it
and we're going to open next week.
Over my friggin' dead body
is she going to direct it.
That's my show.
If you dare put that production on
I will sue your arse
for copyright infringement.
Greg, I'm sorry.
You can't put my show on.
There's nothing more I can do,
I'm sorry about that.
Alright, well, I'm coming back, then.
I'm coming back to direct the show.
I'm not coming back to teach.
But tell Meredith to get
her grubby hands off my cast.
And I'm moving back into the office.
I need the gym for the next five days
and I'll see you on opening night.
Thank you.
OK. Alright.
Thank you, Greg.
Sir, I said I'm sorry.
Ja'mie's in
a massive amount of trouble.
Ashley actually told Mr Cameron
that we were using the AIDS money
to pay for the formal.
And she's seriously getting busted.
It was Holly's idea.
You know where I stand.
It wasn't just me, the other girls
were just as much in it too.
Ashley's just a little
goody-goody bitch for telling.
What happened?
He's being a frig.
Well, what did he say?
He's seriously mad.
Tell us what he said.
We have to give all the money
back to an AIDS charity.
No way.
Are you serious?
Yeah, and he said he's punishing me
by cancelling the formal.
Oh, my God, that's fucked up.
Seriously, if I have to cancel
the formal, I'm going to kill myself.
He does not realise
how much work we've done.
And he's gonna tell
the Department of Education
and I might have to
go back to Hillford.
Seriously.
He is not gonna beat us.
We'll sort something out.
Seriously, what are we gonna do?
Right, everybody reading on
to chapter two
if you 've finished chapter one already.
Can you please put your hand down?
Whoever that was, turn it off now
or it belongs to me.
Do you understand?
It's from Keiran.
What does it say?
It says, "Prepare to lose, fobs."
Little fucking homo.
He's gonna fucking die after.
Fucker.
Jonah, do not tempt me!
I'm just sounding...
You are on thin ice as it is.
Now, do you want me to go
and speak to Mr Peterson
about you misbehaving
in my class again?
I'm just trying to do the work, miss.
I couldn't sound out the word.
I had to say it out loud.
No talking.
Yes, miss.
Alright, everybody, now you 've got
another minute
to finish those questions.
I can't finish this in a minute.
We need more time.
Jonah, finish the questions
in silence like everybody else, OK?
Where do you wanna warm up?
We'll warm up
in the lockers.
Yeah, the teachers never
come into the lockers.
Then we'll go
to the back of the gym.
Jonah! Stop interrupting my class!
I have had enough of it!
What was the last thing I just said?!
What was the last thing
I just asked you to do, Jonah?
I don't know, miss.
I'm waiting. Don't know?
I don't know, miss.
Well, how about an easier
question for you, Jonah?
What's the name of the book
we've been reading all term?
How about I give you a clue, Jonah?
It starts with the letter 'T '.
How about you just give me
any 'T ' word, Jonah?
Any word that starts
with the letter 'T '.
How about you do that?
Do you know what the letter 'T '
looks like, Jonah?
Don't fuck with me, miss.
You 'll regret it.
I'll regret it, will I?
Well, do you know what?
I've had just about enough
of you in my class.
Now, get up out of your seat
and get out!
Go to the principal's office!
No, miss!
Just pick your books up
and get out of my class!
Just get out of my class!
Go now, Jonah!
I don't want to see you
back in here now. Just go!
So Mum's offered to pay
for the DJ and the venue.
And you can give
all the AIDS money to a charity.
And it's worked out really well
and you don't have to tell
the Department of Education.
Well, thank you for coming in,
Mrs King.
You 're very welcome, Mr Cameron.
It's a very generous offer.
But I'm afraid we can't sort of
deal with this issue like that.
You must understand
that Jamie's very enthusiastic.
She is a very enthusiastic girl,
but this is a serious situation
and we need to find a way
to deal with it.
So, um... Mum and I want to know
if you 'll accept a cheque
to keep quiet about this and not tell
the Department of Education.
No, Jamie.
We're really rich.
So just name your price
and we'll sort you out.
Please, Mrs King, put it away.
To be honest, I don't want to tell
the Department of Education,
so I have spoken
to the principal about this
and we have agreed
to keep it under wraps.
If we can find a charity that
we could put the money towards...
Mmm, that's a good idea.
... then that would be good.
Now, to the matter of the formal.
Yep.
I've got an idea
that I'm going to put to you.
We can have the staffroom,
OK, as the formal venue.
You can bring in your stereo
and some streamers and balloons,
you can decorate it up
as much as you like.
No. Sorry.
Sorry, I'm... we're not
having it in the staffroom, sir.
It's not an option, Jamie.
Sir, I'm...
It's the Year 11 formal, OK?
It's meant to be the best night
of Year 11 s' lives.
I'm not...
The theme of the formal's
Rich for a Day,
it's not
Povo Public School Crap for a Day.
I'm not having it in the staffroom.
Jamie, I'm not giving you
an option here.
Sir, seriously.
It's the staffroom or no formal.
Mum, no.
Here's our star.
In a matter of hours,
the arena will ignite.
G to Rodney.
Visuals in 20 seconds.
'Mr G The Musical'!
One teacher tried
to make a difference.
Hey, kids, it's time for school!
# Ecstasy... #
# Some kids
call me a slut... #
# E, e, e... #
# Wanna tell the children... #
I'm a dreamer and I always will be.
Say goodbye. See you in 100 years.
Don't bend the poster.
Threatening a teacher
is an extremely serious business.
Look at Miss Murray
when she's talking to you.
Did you get busted again?
No.
"Teachers at this school are gay."
Fuck off!
You 're a good bloke, sir.
Let's go, boys.
We're setting up
for tonight's formal.
Get off the chair.
We have got the staffroom.
Teachers, can you get out?
I'm pumped for the formal!
Kaitlyn, I totally wore
that style, like, two years ago.
Oh, my God. What am I gonna do?
Oh, my God.
There's so many
attention seekers here.
Ja'mie.
Ja'mie King.
You 're so hot, Ja'mie.
It's my last day. When the bell goes
I'm just gonna lose it.
My friend Brianna's here.
Get a sense of humour, car!
Public schools rock!
That's not a large brain.
High five for the holidays.
