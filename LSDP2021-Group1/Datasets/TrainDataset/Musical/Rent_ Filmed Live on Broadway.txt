We begin on Christmas Eve with me,
Mark, and my roommate, Roger.
We live in an industrial loft on the
corner of 11th Street and Avenue B.
It's the top floor of what was once
a music-publishing factory.
Old rock 'n' roll posters
hang on the walls.
They have Roger's picture
advertising gigs...
...at CBGB's and the Pyramid Club.
We have an illegal
wood-burning stove.
Its exhaust pipe crawls up
to a skylight.
All of our electrical appliances
are plugged...
...into one thick extension cord
which snakes its way out a window.
Outside, a small tent city has sprung
up in the lot next to our building.
Inside, it's freezing
because we have no heat.
Smile!
December 24th, 9 p. m.
Eastern Standard Time
From here on in,
I shoot without a script
See if anything comes of it
Instead of my old shit
First shot Roger
Tuning the Fender guitar
He hasn't played in a year
- This won't tune
- So we hear
He's just coming back
From half a year of withdrawal
- You talking to me?
- Not at all
Are you ready?
Hold that focus steady
Tell the folks at home
What you're doing, Roger
I'm writing one great-
- The phone rings
- Saved
Re-screen
Zoom in on the answering machine
- Speak.
- Speak.
That was a very loud beep
I don't even know if this is working
Mark? Mark? Are you there?
Are you screening your calls?
It's Mom
We wanted to call
And say we love you
And we'll miss you tomorrow
Cindy and the kids are here
Send their love
Oh, I hope you like the hot plate
Just don't leave it on, dear
When you leave the house
Oh, and Mark
We're sorry to hear
That Maureen dumped you
I say c'est la vie
So let her be a lesbian
There are other fishies in the sea
Love, Mom
Tell the folks at home
What you're doing, Roger
- I'm writing one great song
- The phone rings
We screen
- Speak.
- Speak.
- Chestnuts roasting
- Collins
- I'm downstairs
- Hey
Roger picked up the phone?
- No, it's me
- Throw down the key
A wild night is now preordained
I may be detained
What does he mean?
What do you mean, detained?
- Benny. Shit.
- Shit.
- Dudes, I'm on my way
- Great, fuck
- I need the rent
- What rent?
- This past year's rent, which I let slide.
- Let slide?
You said we were golden.
- When you bought the building
- When we were roommates
- Remember, you lived here?
- How could I forget?
You, me, Collins and Maureen.
How is the drama queen?
She's performing tonight.
I know.
Still a production manager?
Two days ago, I was bumped.
- You still dating her?
- Last month, I was dumped
- She's in love
- Oh, she's got a new man?
- Well, no-
- What's his name?
- Joanne.
- Joanne.
Rent, my amigos, is due,
or I will have to evict you.
Be there in a few.
The power blows.
How do you document real life
When real life's getting more
Like fiction each day?
Headlines, bread lines
Blow my mind
And now this deadline
Eviction or pay
Rent
How do you write a song
When the chords sound wrong?
Though they once sounded
Right and rare
When the notes are sour
Where is the power
You once had to ignite the air?
- We're hungry and frozen
- Some life we've chosen
- How we gonna pay?
- How we gonna pay?
- How we gonna pay?
- How we gonna pay?
- How we gonna pay
- How we gonna pay
- Last year's rent?
- Last year's rent?
We light candles.
How do you start a fire
When there's nothing to burn
And it feels like something's stuck
In your flue?
How can you generate heat
When you can't feel your feet
- And they're turning blue?
- And they're turning blue?
You light up a mean blaze
- With posters
- And screenplays
- How we gonna pay?
- How we gonna pay?
- How we gonna pay?
- How we gonna pay?
- How we gonna pay
- How we gonna pay
- Last year's rent?
- Last year's rent?
Don't screen, Maureen, it's me.
Joanne, your substitute
production manager.
Hey, hey, hey. Did you eat?
Don't change the subject, Maureen
But, darling,
You haven't eaten all day
You won't throw up
You won't throw up
The digital delay
didn't blow up, exactly.
There may have been one teeny,
tiny spark.
You're not calling Mark.
How do you stay on your feet
When on every street
It's trick or treat
And tonight it's trick?
Welcome back to town
I should lie down
Everything's brown
And, uh-oh, I feel sick
- Where is he?
- Getting dizzy
- How we gonna pay?
- How we gonna pay?
How we gonna pay?
How we gonna pay
Last year's rent?
Allison, baby
You sound sad
I can't believe those two
After everything I've done
Ever since our wedding, I'm dirt
They'll see
I can help them all out
In the long run
The music ignites the night
- With passionate fire
- Maureen, I'm not a theater person.
The narration crackles and pops
With incendiary wit
Could never be a theater person.
Zoom in as they burn the past
To the ground
And feel the heat
Of the future's glow
Hello. Maureen.
Your equipment won't work?
Okay, all right, I'll go.
How do you leave the past behind
When it keeps finding ways
To get to your heart?
It reaches way down deep
And tears you inside out
Till you're torn apart
Rent
How can you connect in an age
Where strangers, landlords, lovers
Your own blood cells betray?
What binds the fabric together
When the raging, shifting winds
Of change keep ripping away?
Draw a line in the sand
And then make a stand
- Use your camera to spar
- Use your guitar
When they act tough
You call their bluff
We're not gonna pay
We're not gonna pay
We're not gonna pay
Last year's rent
This year's rent
Next year's rent
Rent, rent, rent, rent, rent
We're not gonna pay rent
'Cause everything is rent
Christmas bells are ringing
Christmas bells are ringing
Christmas bells are ringing
Somewhere else, not here
You okay, honey?
I'm afraid so
They get any money?
No, had none to get
But they purloined my coat
Well, you missed a sleeve
- Thanks
- Hell, it's Christmas Eve
I'm Angel
Angel
Indeed.
An angel of the first degree
Friends call me Collins.
Tom Collins.
Nice tree
Let's get a Band-Aid for your knee
I'll change it
There's a Life Support meeting
At 9:30
Yes, this body
Provides a comfortable home
For the Acquired Immune
Deficiency Syndrome
- As does mine
- Oh, well, you look fine
Get you a coat
Have a bite and make a night
- I'm flush
- My friends are waiting
You're cute when you blush
The more, the merry
Ho, ho, ho
And I do not take no
- Where are you going?
- Maureen calls.
You're such a sucker.
I don't suppose you'd like to see
her show in the lot tonight...
...or come to dinner?
Zoom in on my empty wallet.
Touché.
Take your AZT.
Close on Roger
His girlfriend April left a note
Saying, "We've got AIDS"
Before slitting her wrists
In the bathroom
I'll check up on you later.
If you change your mind...
You have to get out of the house.
I'm writing one great song
Before I...
God.
One song
Glory
One song before I go
Glory
One song to leave behind
Find one song
One last refrain
Glory
From the pretty-boy front man
Who wasted opportunity
One song
He had the world at his feet
Glory
In the eyes of a young girl
A young girl
Find glory
Beyond the cheap colored lights
One song
Before the sun sets
Glory
On another empty life
Time flies
Time dies
Glory
One blaze of glory
One blaze of glory
Glory
Find glory
In a song that rings true
Truth like a blazing fire
An eternal flame
Find one song
A song about love
Glory
From the soul of a young man
A young man
Find the one song
Before the virus takes hold
Glory
Like a sunset
One song
To redeem this empty life
Time flies
And then no need
To endure anymore
Time dies
The door.
- What'd you forget?
- Got a light?
I know you, you're-
You're shivering
It's nothing
They turned off my heat
And I'm just a little weak on my feet
Would you light my candle?
- What are you staring at?
- Nothing
Your hair in the moonlight
You look familiar
- Can you make it?
- Just haven't eaten much today
At least the room
Stopped spinning anyway
- What?
- Nothing
- Your smile reminded me of-
- I always "remind people of"
- Who is she?
- She died
- Her name was April
- It's out again
Sorry 'bout your friend
Would you light my candle?
- Well?
- Yeah?
Oh, the wax
- It's-
- Dripping
- I like it between my-
- Fingers
I figured
Oh, well, good night
- It blew out again?
- No, I think that I dropped my stash
I know I've seen you out and about
When I used to go out
Your candle's out
I'm illin'
I had it when I walked in the door
It was pure
Is it on the floor?
The floor?
They say that I have the best ass
Below 14th Street
- Is it true?
- What?
- You're staring again
- Oh, no
I mean, you do have a nice-
I mean, you look familiar
- Like your dead girlfriend
- Only when you smile
But I'm sure I've seen you
Somewhere else
Do you go to the Cat Scratch Club?
That's where I work
I dance
Help me look
Yes
They used to tie you up
It's a living
I didn't recognize you
Without the handcuffs
We could light the candle
Oh, won't you light the candle?
Why don't you forget that stuff?
- You look like you're 16
- I'm 19
But I'm old for my age
I'm just born to be bad
I once was born to be bad
I used to shiver like that
- I have no heat, I told you
- I used to sweat
- I got a cold
- Uh-huh, I used to be a junkie
- But now and then I like to feel good
- Uh-huh
- Oh, here
- What's that?
Candy-bar wrapper.
We could light the candle
Oh, what'd you do to my candle?
- That was my last match
- Our eyes'll adjust
- Thank God for the moon
- Maybe it's not the moon at all
I hear Spike Lee's shootin'
Down the street
Bah humbug
Bah humbug
- Cold hands
- Yours too
Big
Like my father's
Do you wanna dance?
With you?
- No, with my father
- I'm Roger
They call me
They call me Mimi
Hi, you've reached Maureen
and Joanne. Leave a message.
Don't forget "Over the Moon,"
my performance...
...protesting the eviction of the
homeless and artists...
...from the 11th Street lot tonight
at midnight, between A and B.
Party at Life Cafe to follow.
Well, Joanne, we're off
I tried you at the office
And they said you were
Stage managing or something
Remind her that those unwed
mothers in Harlem need her help too.
Call Daisy for our itinerary
Or Alfred at Pound Ridge
Or Eileen at the State Department
In a pinch
We'll be at the spa for New Year's
Unless the senator changes his mind
- The hearings
- Oh, yes, kitten
Mommy's confirmation hearings
Begin on the 10th
We'll need you alone
By the 6th
- Harold!
- You hear that?
Just three weeks away
And she's already nervous
- I am not
- For Mommy's sake, kitten
No Doc Martens this time
And wear a dress, oh, and Kitten
- Have a merry
- And a bra
Enter Tom Collins.
Computer genius, teacher,
vagabond anarchist...
...who ran naked
through the Parthenon.
Bustelo, Marlboro
Banana by the bunch
A box of Cap'n Crunch
Will taste so good
- And firewood
- Look, it's Santa Claus
- Hold your applause
- Oh, hi
- "Oh, hi," after seven months?
- Sorry
This boy could use some Stoli
Oh, holy night
You struck gold at MIT
They expelled me for my theory
of actual reality...
...which I'll soon impart to the couch
potatoes at New York University.
- Still haven't left the house?
- I was waiting for you, don't you know?
Well, tonight's the night. Come to
the Life Cafe after Maureen's show.
No flow.
Gentlemen, our benefactor
On this Christmas Eve
Whose charity is only matched
By talent, I believe
A new member of the Alphabet City
Avant-garde
Angel Dumott Schunard
Today for you
Tomorrow for me
Today for you
Tomorrow for me
- And you should hear her beat
- You earned this on the street?
It was my lucky day today
On Avenue A
When a lady in a limousine
Drove my way
She said, "Darling, be a dear
Haven't slept in a year
I need your help to make my
Neighbor's yappy dog disappear
This Akita, Evita, just won't shut up
I believe if you play nonstop
That pup will breathe its very last
High-strung breath
I'm certain that cur
Will bark itself to death"
Today for you
Tomorrow for me
Today for you
Tomorrow for me
We agreed on a fee
$1000 guarantee, tax free
And a bonus if I trim her tree
Now, who could foretell
That it would go so well?
But sure as I am here
That dog is now in doggy hell
After an hour, Evita, in all her glory
From a window ledge
Of that 23rd story
Like Thelma and Louise did
When they got the blues
Swan-dove into the courtyard
Of the Gracie Mews
Today for you
Tomorrow for me
Today for you
Tomorrow for me
You go, girl.
Back on the street
Where I met my sweet
Where he was moaning and groaning
On the cold concrete
The nurse took him home
For some Mercurochrome
Then I dressed his wounds
And got him back on his feet
Sing it
Today for you
Tomorrow for me
Today for you
Tomorrow for me
I said
Today for you
Tomorrow for me
Today for you
Tomorrow
For me
Joy to the world
Hey. You bum. Yeah, you.
Move over.
Get your ass off that Range Rover.
That attitude toward the homeless...
...is exactly what Maureen
is protesting tonight.
Close-up: Our ex-roommate,
Benjamin Coffin III...
...who married Allison Grey
of the Westport Greys...
...then bought our building
and the lot next door...
...from his father-in-law,
in hopes of starting a cyber-studio.
Maureen is protesting
Losing her performance space
Not my attitude
What happened to Benny?
What happened to his heart
And the ideals he once pursued?
Any owner of that lot next door
Has the right to do with it
As he pleases
Happy birthday, Jesus
- The rent
- You're wasting your time
- We're broke
- You broke your word, this is absurd
There is one way
You won't have to pay
I knew it.
Next door, the home of CyberArts
And now that the block is rezoned
Our dream can become a reality
You'll see, boys
You'll see, boys
A state-of-the-art, digital
Virtual interactive studio
I'll forgo your rent
And on paper guarantee
That you can stay here for free
- If you do me one small favor.
- What?
Convince Maureen
to cancel her protest.
Why not just get an injunction
or call the cops?
I did, and they're on standby.
But my investors would rather
I handle this quietly
You can't wipe out
an entire tent city...
...then watch It's a Wonderful Life
on TV.
You wanna produce films
and write songs?
You need somewhere to do it
It's what we used to dream about
Think twice before you pooh-pooh it
You'll see, boys
You'll see, boys
You'll see the beauty of a studio
That lets us do our work
And get paid
With condos on the top
Whose rent keeps open our shop
Just stop the protest
And you'll have it made
You'll see
Or you'll pack.
That boy could use some Prozac.
- Or heavy drugs.
- Or group hugs.
Which reminds me,
we have a detour to make tonight.
Anyone who wants to
can come along.
Life Support's a group for people
coping with life.
We don't have to stay too long.
First I've got a protest to save
- Pleasure.
- I'm not much company.
- Behave.
- He'll catch up later.
He's just got other things
on his mind.
We'll see, boys
We'll see, boys
Let it be, boys
- I like boys
- Boys like me
We'll see
And so, into the abyss
The lot, where a small stage
is partially set up.
Line in.
I went to Harvard for this?
- Close on Mark's nose dive.
- Line out.
Will he get out of here alive?
- Mark?
- Hi.
I told her not to call you
That's Maureen, but can I help
Since I'm here?
I've hired an engineer.
Great.
So nice to have met you.
Wait.
She's three hours late.
The samples won't delay
But the cable-
There's another way
Say something, anything
Test, one, two, three
Anything but that
- This is weird
- It's weird
- Very weird
- Fuckin' weird
I'm so mad that
I don't know what to do
Fighting with microphones
Freezing down to my bones
And to top it all off
I'm with you
Feel like going insane?
Got a fire in your brain?
And you're thinking
Of drinking gasoline?
- As a matter of fact
- Honey, I know this act
It's called the Tango: Maureen
The Tango: Maureen
It's a dark, dizzy merry-go-round
- As she keeps you dangling
- You're wrong
- Your heart she is mangling
- It's different with me
And you toss and you turn
'Cause her cold eyes can burn
Yet you yearn, and you churn
And rebound
I think I know what you mean
- The Tango: Maureen
- The Tango: Maureen
Has she ever pouted her lips
And called you "pookie"?
Never.
Have you ever
Doubted a kiss or two?
This is spooky
Did you swoon
When she walked through the door?
Every time, so be cautious
Did she moon over other boys?
- More than moon
- I'm getting nauseous
Where'd you learn how to tango?
With the French ambassador's
daughter in her room at Miss Porter's.
And you?
With Nanette Himmelfarb,
the rabbi's daughter...
...at the Scarsdale Jewish
Community Center.
It's hard to do this backwards.
You should try it in heels.
- She cheated
- She cheated
- Maureen cheated
- Fuckin' cheated
I'm defeated
I should give up right now
Gotta look on the bright side
With all of your might
I'd fall for her still, anyhow
When you're dancing her dance
You don't stand a chance
Her grip of romance makes you fall
- So you think, "Might as well"
- "Dance a tango to hell"
"At least I'll have tangoed at all"
The Tango: Maureen
Gotta dance till your diva is through
You pretend to believe her
'Cause in the end
You can't leave her
But the end, it will come
Still you have to play dumb
Till you're glum and you bum
And turn blue
Why do we love when she's mean?
And she can be so obscene
Try the mike.
My Maureen
- Patched.
- Thanks.
You know, I feel great now.
I feel lousy.
Hey, honey. We're- "Pookie"?
You never called me "Pookie. "
Forget it. We're patched.
The Tango: Maureen
Steve.
Gordon.
Ali.
- Pam.
- Lisa.
Hi. I'm Angel.
Tom. Collins.
I'm Paul. Let's begin.
There's only us
There's only this
Sorry. Excuse me.
And you are...?
Oh, I'm not- I'm just here-
I don't have- I'm here with...
Mark
Mark
I'm Mark.
Well, this is quite an operation
Sit down, Mark.
We'll continue the affirmation.
Forget regret
Or life is yours to miss
Excuse me, Paul
I'm having a problem with this
This credo
My T-cells are low.
I regret that news, okay?
All right, but, Gordon
How do you feel today?
- What do you mean?
- How do you feel today?
- Okay.
- Is that all?
- Best I've felt all year
- Then why choose fear?
I'm a New Yorker
Fear's my life
Look, I find
Some of what you teach suspect
Because I'm used to
Relying on intellect
But I try to open up
To what I don't know
Because reason says
I should have died
Three years ago
No other road
No other way
No day but today
What's the time?
Well, it's gotta be close to midnight
My body's talking to me
It says, "Time for danger"
It says, "I wanna commit a crime
Wanna be the cause of a fight
I wanna put on a tight skirt
And flirt with a stranger"
I've had a knack from way back
At breaking the rules
Once I learn the game
Get up, life's too quick
I know someplace sick
Where this chick'll
Dance in the flames
We don't need any money
I always get in for free
You can get in too
If you get in with me
Let's go
Out tonight
I have to go
Out tonight
You wanna play?
Let's run away
We won't be back
Before it's Christmas Day
Take me out tonight
Meow.
Yeah
When I get a wink
From the doorman
Do you know how lucky you'll be?
That you're on the line
With the feline of Avenue B
Let's go
Out tonight
I have to go
Out tonight
You wanna prowl?
Be my night owl?
Well, take my hand, we're gonna
Howl
Out tonight
In the evening I gotta roam
Can't sleep in the city
Of neon and chrome
Feels too damn much like home
When the Spanish babies cry
So let's find a bar
So dark we forget who we are
Where all the scars
From the nevers and maybes die
Let's go
Out tonight
I have to go
Out tonight
You're sweet
Wanna hit the street?
Wanna wail at the moon
Like a cat in heat?
Just take me
Out tonight
Please take me
Out tonight
Don't forsake me
Out tonight
I'll let you make me
Out tonight
Tonight
Tonight
Tonight
Who do you think you are?
Barging in on me and my guitar
Little girl, hey, the door is that way
You better go
You know the fire's out anyway
Take your powder
Take your candle
Your sweet whisper
I just can't handle
Well, take your hair
In the moonlight
Your brown eyes
Goodbye, good night
I should tell you
I should tell you
I should tell you, I should-
No
Another time, another place
Our temperature would climb
There'd be a long embrace
We'd do another dance
It'd be another play
Looking for romance?
Come back another day
Another day
The heart may freeze
Or it can burn
The pain will ease
If I can learn
There is no future
There is no past
I live this moment as
My last
There's only us
There's only this
Forget regret
Or life is yours to miss
No other road
No other way
No day but today
Excuse me if I'm off track
But if you're so wise
Then tell me
Why do you need smack?
Take your needle
Take your fancy prayer
Don't forget
Get the moonlight out of your hair
Long ago you might have
Lit up my heart
But the fire's dead
Ain't never ever gonna start
Another time
Another place
The words would only rhyme
We'd be in outer space
It'd be another song
We'd sing another way
You wanna prove me wrong?
Come back another day
Another day
There's only yes
Only tonight
We must let go
To know what's right
No other course
No other way
No day but today
I can't control
Control your temper
My destiny
She doesn't see
I trust my soul
- Who says that there's a soul?
- My only goal
Is just to be
Just let me be
- Who do you think you are?
- There's only now, there's only here
- Barging in on me and my guitar
- Give in to love, or live in fear
- Little girl, hey
- No other path
- The door is that way
- No other way
No day but today
The fire's out anyway
No day but today
Take your powder
Take your candle
No day but today
Take your brown eyes
Your pretty smile, your silhouette
No day but today
Another time, another place
Another rhyme, a warm embrace
No day but today
Another dance
Another way, another chance
Another day
No day but today
I'm writing one great song
Before I...
Will I lose my dignity?
Will someone care?
Will I wake tomorrow
From this nightmare?
Will I lose my dignity?
Will someone care?
Will I wake tomorrow
From this nightmare?
- Will I lose my dignity?
- Will I lose my dignity?
Will someone care?
Will someone care?
- Will I wake tomorrow
- Will I wake tomorrow
- From this nightmare?
- From this nightmare?
- Will I lose my dignity?
- Will I lose my dignity?
- Will someone care?
- Will I lose my dignity?
- Will I wake tomorrow
- Will someone care?
- From this nightmare?
- Will I wake tomorrow
- Will I lose my dignity?
- From this nightmare?
Will I lose my dignity?
- Will someone care?
- Will I lose my dignity?
- Will I wake tomorrow
- Will someone care?
- From this nightmare?
- Will I wake tomorrow?
Christmas bells are ringing
- Christmas bells are ringing
- Christmas bells are ringing
Christmas bells are ringing
Out of town
Santa Fe
Honest living, man.
Evening, officer.
Smile for Ted Koppel,
Officer Martin.
And a merry Christmas
To your family
Right.
Who the fuck do you think you are?
I don't need no goddamn help
From some
Bleeding heart cameraman
My life's not for you
To make a name for yourself on
Easy, sugar, easy
He was just trying to-
Just trying to use me
To kill his guilt
It's not that kind of movie, honey.
Let's go. This line is full
of motherfucking artists.
Hey. Artist. You got a dollar?
Yeah, I thought not.
New York City.
Center of the universe
Sing it, girl.
Times are shitty, but I'm pretty sure
they can't get worse.
I hear you.
It's a comfort to know
When you're singing
The hit-the-road blues
That anywhere else you could
Possibly go after New York would be
A pleasure cruise
Now you're talking.
Well, I'm thwarted by a
Metaphysic puzzle
And I'm sick of grading papers
That I know
I'm shouting in my sleep
I need a muzzle
All this misery pays no salary
So
Let's open up a restaurant
In Santa Fe
Sunny Santa Fe would be nice
We'll open up a restaurant
In Santa Fe
And leave this
To the roaches and mice
- You teach?
- I teach.
Computer Age Philosophy.
But my students
would rather watch TV.
- America.
- America.
You're a sensitive aesthete
Brush the sauce onto the meat
You can make the menu
Sparkle with a rhyme
You can drum a gentle drum
And I can seat guests as they come
Chatting not about Heidegger
But wine
Let's open up a restaurant
In Santa Fe
- Santa Fe
- Our labors would reap financial gain
- Gain
- Gain
We'll open up a restaurant
In Santa Fe
- Santa Fe
- And save from devastation our brains
Save our brains
We'll pack up all our junk
And fly so far away
Devote ourselves to projects
That sell
We'll open up a restaurant
In Santa Fe
Forget this cold bohemian hell
Do you know the way
To Santa Fe?
You know, tumbleweeds
Prairie dogs
Yeah
I'll see you at the show
I'll try and convince Roger to go
- Alone at last
- He'll be back. I guarantee.
- I've been hearing violins all night.
- Anything to do with me?
Are we a thing?
Darling, we're everything.
Live in my house
I'll be your shelter
Just pay me back
With 1000 kisses
Be my lover
And I'll cover you
Open your door
I'll be your tenant
Don't got much baggage
To lay at your feet
But sweet kisses I've got to spare
I'll be there and I'll cover you
- I think they meant it
- I think they meant it
When they said you can't buy love
Now I know you can rent it
- A new lease you are, my love
- A new lease you are, my love
- On life
- On life
- Be my life
- Be my life
- Girl, where you taking me?
- Wherever you wanna go.
- All right.
- My wig, hold on.
Just slip me on
I'll be your blanket
Wherever, whatever
I'll be your coat
You'll be my king
And I'll be your castle
No, you'll be my queen
And I'll be your moat
I think they meant it
When they said you can't buy love
Now I know you can rent it
A new lease you are, my love
- On life
- On life
- All my life
- All my life
- I've longed to discover
- I've longed to discover
- Something as true as this is
- Something as true as this is
- So with a thousand sweet kisses
- If you're cold and you're lonely
I'll cover you
With a thousand sweet kisses
- You've got one nickel only
- I'll cover you
With a thousand sweet kisses
- When you're worn-out and tired
- I'll cover you
With a thousand sweet kisses
- When your heart has expired
- I'll cover you
- Oh, lover
- Oh, lover
- I'll cover you
- I'll cover you
- Yeah, yeah, yeah
- Yeah, yeah, yeah
- Oh, lover
- Oh, lover
- I'll cover you
- I'll cover you
Steve, Joanne. The Murget case?
A dismissal. Good work, counselor.
We're okay
Honey bear, wait
I'm on the other phone
Yes, I have the cowbell
We're okay
So tell them we'll sue
But a settlement will do
Sexual harassment
And civil rights too
Oh, Steve, you're great
No, you cut the paper plate
Did you cheat on Mark
A lot would you say?
We're okay
Honey, hold on.
Steve, I need- Hold on.
Hello?
Dad, yes, I beeped you
Maureen is coming
To Mother's hearing
We're okay
Honey bear, what?
Newt's lesbian sister? I'll tell them.
You heard? They heard.
We're okay
And you, Dad
Yep, Jill is there
Steve, got-
Jill with the short, black hair
The Calvin Klein model?
Steve, gotta go
The model who lives
In Penthouse A?
We're
We're okay
I'm on my way
Christmas bells are ringing
Christmas bells are ringing
Christmas bells are singing
On TV at Saks
Honest living, honest living
Honest living, honest living
Can't you spare a dime or two
Here but for the grace of God go you
You'll be merry
I'll be merry
Though merry
Ain't in my vocabulary
No sleigh bells
No Santa Claus
No yule log
No tinsel
No holly
No hearth
- No
- Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer
Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer
No room at the Holiday Inn
Oh, no
And it's beginning to snow
Hats, bats, shoes, booze
Mountain bikes, potpourri
Leather bags, girlie mags
Forty-fives, AZT
No one's buying
Feel like crying
No room at the Holiday Inn
Oh, no
And it's beginning to snow
How about a fur
In perfect shape
Owned by an MBA from uptown?
I got a tweed
Broken in by a greedy
Broker who went broke
And then broke down
- You don't have to do this
- Hush your mouth, it's Christmas
I do not deserve you, Angel
- Give, give
- Wait
- All you do is give
- What's on the floor?
- Give me some way
- Let's see some more
- To show
- No, no, no
How you've touched me so
Kiss me
It's beginning to snow
She said
"Would you light my candle?"
And she put on a pout
And she wanted you
To take her out tonight?
- Right
- She got you out
She was more than okay
But I pushed her away
It was bad, I got mad
And I had to get her
Out of my sight
Wait, wait, wait
You said she was sweet
Let's go eat
I'll just get fat
It's the one vice left
When you're dead meat
- There, that's her
- Maureen?
Mimi!
I should go
Hey, it's beginning to snow
I'm dreaming of a white
Right Christmas
Follow the man, follow the man
With his pockets full of the jam
Follow the man, follow the man
Help me out, Daddy, if you can
- Got any D, man?
- I'm cool
- Got any C, man?
- I'm cool
Got any X? Any smack?
Any horse? Any jugie boogie boy?
Any blow?
- Hey
- Hey
I just want to say
I'm sorry for the way
- Forget it
- I blew up
- Can I make it up to you?
- How?
- Dinner party?
- That'll do
Hey, lover boy, cutie pie
You steal my client, you die
You didn't miss me
You won't miss her
You'll never lack for customers
I'm willin', I'm illin'
I gotta get my sickness off
Gotta run, gotta ride
Gotta gun, gotta hide, gotta go
And it's beginning to snow
We're out of luck, Allison
The protest is on
L.L.Bean, Geoffrey Beene
Burberry zip out lining
Mark, this is Mimi.
She'll be dining with us.
- Here's a new arrival
- That is an ounce
- Hats, bats, rats
- That's my coat
- We give discounts
- I think we've met
- Let's get a better one
- It's a sham
- That's what he said
- I said it's a gram
- She's a thief
- But she brought us together
- Which investor is coming?
- I'll take the leather
Your father? Damn.
Let's go to the lot
Maureen's performing
- Who's Maureen?
- His ex.
But I am over her
I should tell you
I have to tell you
- Let's not hold hands yet
- Is that a warning?
I need to take it slow
I should tell you, I should tell you
I should tell you, I should tell you
I should tell you
I-
And it's beginning to
And it's beginning to
And it's beginning to
Joanne? Which way to the stage?
Snow
Maureen's performance.
Last night I had a dream.
I found myself in a desert
called Cyberland.
It was hot.
My canteen had sprung a leak,
and I was...
...thirsty.
Out of the abyss walked a cow.
Elsie.
I asked if she had anything to drink.
She said:
"I'm forbidden to produce milk
In Cyberland we only drink
Diet Coke"
Yes.
She said:
"Only thing to do
Is jump over the moon
They've closed everything real down
Like barns and troughs
And performance spaces
And replaced it all with lies
And rules and virtual life"
But there is a way out.
Leap of faith, leap of faith
Leap of faith, leap of faith
Only thing to do
Is jump over the moon
I gotta get out of here
It's like I'm being tied to the hood
Of a yellow rental truck
Packed in
With fertilizer and fuel oil
Pushed over a cliff
By a suicidal Mickey Mouse
I've
Gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta
Gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta
Gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta
Gotta, gotta find a way
To jump over the moon
Only thing to do
Is jump over the moon
Then a little bulldog entered.
His name, we have learned,
was Benny.
And although he once
had principles...
...he abandoned them
to live as a lapdog...
...to a wealthy daughter
of the revolution.
A one, two, three
"That's bull," Benny said
"Ever since the cat took up the fiddle
That cow's been jumpy
The dish and the spoon were evicted
From the table and eloped
She's had trouble with her milk
And the moon ever since
Maybe it's a female thing
'Cause who'd wanna leave
Cyberland anyway?
Walls ain't so bad
The dish and the spoon, for instance
They're down on their luck
They come knockin'
On my doghouse door
And I said
'Not in my backyard, utensils.
Go back to China"'
"The only way out is up"
Elsie whispered to me
"A leap
Of faith"
"Still thirsty?"
"Parched. "
"Have some milk. "
And I lowered myself
beneath her swollen udder...
...and sucked the sweetest milk
I had ever tasted.
"Climb onboard," she said
And as a harvest moon
rose over Cyberland...
...we reared back,
we sprang into a gallop...
...leaping out of orbit.
I awoke, singing...
Singing.
Shit.
Leap of faith
Leap of faith
Leap of faith
Leap of faith
Only thing to do
Only thing to do is jump
Only thing to do is
Jump over the moon
Only thing to do is
Jump over the moon
Over the moon
Over the...
Moo with me.
Moo, yes. Oh, it's so great.
Yeah. Up there, let me hear you.
Yes!
Thank you.
No, please, no, not tonight
Mister, can't you go?
- Can't have a scene
- What?
Please go. You- Hello sir.
I said no. Important customer.
What am I, just a blur?
- You sit all night, you never buy
- That's a lie, that's a lie
- I had a tea the other day
- You couldn't pay
Oh, yeah.
Benjamin Coffin III, here?
Oh, no
Wine and beer
The enemy of Avenue A
And Mr. Grey.
What brings the mogul in his own
mind to the Life Cafe?
I would like to propose a toast
to Maureen's noble try.
- It went well.
- Go to hell.
Was the yuppie scum stomped?
Not counting the homeless,
how many tickets weren't comped?
- Why did Muffy-
- Allison.
Miss the show?
There was a death in the family
if you must know.
- Sorry.
- Who died?
Our Akita.
- Evita.
- Evita.
Mimi. I'm surprised.
A bright and charming girl like you
Hangs out with these slackers
Who don't adhere to deals
They make fun
Yet I'm the one
Attempting to do some good
Or do you really want
A neighborhood
Where people piss
On your stoop every night?
Bohemia
Bohemia's a fallacy in your head
This is Calcutta
Bohemia is dead
Dearly beloved
We gather here
To say our goodbyes
Here she lies
No one knew her worth
The late, great daughter
Of Mother Earth
On this night
When we celebrate the birth
In that little town of Bethlehem
We raise our glass
You bet your ass

Going insane

No pension
To more than one dimension
To starving for attention,
Hating convention, hating pretension
Not to mention, of course
Hating dear old Mom and Dad

To no absolutes
To Absolut

To being an us for once

The mixer doesn't have a case
Don't give me that face
Hey, mister
She's my sister
So that's five miso soup

Two tofu-dog platter
And one pasta with meatless balls
It tastes the same

La vie bohème
In honor of the death of bohemia...
...an impromptu salon will commence
immediately following dinner.
Mimi Marquez,
clad only in bubblewrap...
...will perform her famous
lawn-chair handcuff dance...
...to the sounds of iced tea
being stirred.
And Mark Cohen will preview
his new documentary...
...about his inability to hold an erection
on the High Holy Days.
Maureen Johnson,
back from her spectacular...
...one-night engagement
at the 11th Street lot...
...will sing native American
tribal chants backwards...
...through her vocoder, accompanying
herself on electric cello.
Which she has never studied.
Your new boyfriend
Doesn't know about us
- There's nothing to know
- Don't you think we should discuss?
- It was three months ago
- He doesn't act like he's with you
- We're taking it slow
- Where is he now?
He's right-
Where'd he go?
And Roger will attempt to write
a bittersweet, evocative song...
...that doesn't remind us
of "Musetta's Waltz. "
Angel Dumott Schunard will model
the latest fall fashions from Paris...
...while accompanying herself
on the 10-gallon plastic pickle tub.
And Collins will recount
his exploits as anarchist...
...including his successful
reprogramming...
...of the MIT virtual-reality
equipment to self-destruct...
...as it broadcasts the words:
Actual reality. ACT UP. Fight AIDS.
Excuse me
Did I do somethin' wrong?
I get invited, then ignored
All night long
I've been tryin'
I'm not lyin'
No one's perfect
I've got baggage
Life's too short, babe
Time is flyin'
I'm lookin' for baggage
That goes with mine
- I should tell you
- I've got baggage too
- Should tell you-
- Baggage
Wine and beer
AZT break.
You?
Me
You?
Mimi
I should tell you
I'm disaster
I forget how to begin it
Let's just make this part go faster
I have yet to be in it
I should tell you
I should tell you
I should tell you
I should tell you
I should tell I blew the candle out
Just to get back in
I'd forgotten how to smile
Until your candle burned my skin
I should tell you
I should tell you
I should tell you
- I should tell
- I should tell
- Well, here we go
- Well, here we go

- Now we
Oh, no
I know this something is

Are we packed?
Yes, and by next week,
I want you to be.
Pookie-
And you should see
They've padlocked your building
And they're rioting on Avenue B
- Benny called the cops.
- That fuck.
They don't know what they're doing
The cops are sweeping the lot
But no one's leaving.
They're just sitting there mooing.
- To dance
- No way to make a living
Masochism, pain, perfection
Muscle spasms, chiropractors
Short careers, eating disorders
- Film
- Adventure, tedium
No family, boring locations
Darkrooms
Perfect faces, egos, money
Hollywood and sleaze
- Music
- Food of love, emotion
Mathematics, isolation
Rhythm, power
Feeling, harmony
And heavy competition
- Anarchy
- Revolution, justice
Screaming for solutions
Forcing changes, risk and danger
Making noise and making pleas
To faggots, lezzies, dykes
Cross-dressers too
- To me
- To me
To you and you and you
You and you
To people living with
Living with, living with
Not dying from disease
Let he among us without sin
Be the first to condemn

- La vie bohème
- Anyone out of the mainstream
- La vie bohème
- Is anyone in the mainstream?
- La vie bohème
- Anyone alive with a sex drive
- La vie bohème
- Tear down the wall
Aren't we all?
The opposite of war isn't peace
It's creation
La vie bohème
The riot continues.
The Christmas tree goes up in flames.
The snow dances.
Oblivious, Mimi and Roger
share a small, lovely kiss.
Viva la vie bohème!
Five hundred twenty-five thousand
Six hundred minutes
Five hundred twenty-five thousand
Moments so dear
Five hundred twenty-five thousand
Six hundred minutes
How do you measure
Measure a year?
In daylights, in sunsets
In midnights, in cups of coffee
In inches, in miles
In laughter, in strife
Five hundred twenty-five thousand
Six hundred minutes
How do you measure
A year in the life?
How about love?
How about love?
How about love?
Measure in love
Seasons of love
Seasons of love
Five hundred twenty-five thousand
Six hundred minutes
Five hundred twenty-five thousand
Journeys to plan
Five hundred twenty-five thousand
Six hundred minutes
How do you measure the life
Of a woman or man?
In truths that she learned
Or in times that he cried
In bridges he burned
Or the way that she died
It's time now to sing out
The story never ends
Let's celebrate
Remember a year in the life of friends
Remember the love
You got to
You got to remember the love
Don't you know
Got to give love
Give love
Give love
Measure, measure your life
In love
Seasons of love
Seasons of love
Gonna be loved
Loved
Pan to the padlocked door.
New Year's Rockin' Eve.
The breaking back
into the building party.
- How long till next year?
- Three and a half minutes.
I'm giving up my vices
I'm going back
Back to school
Eviction or not
This week's been so hot
That as long as I got you
I know I'll be cool
I couldn't crack the love code, dear
Till you made the lock
On my heart explode
It's gonna be a happy New Year
A Happy New Year
Coast is clear
You're supposed to be working
That's for midnight
Where are they?
There isn't much time
Maybe they're dressing
I mean, what does one wear
That's apropos for a party
That's also a crime?
Chips anyone?
You can take the girl
Out of Hicksville
But you can't take the Hicksville
Out of the girl
My riot got you on TV
I deserve a royalty
Be nice, you two
Or no God-awful champagne
Don't mind if I do
No luck?
Bolted plywood
Padlocked with a chain
- A total dead end
- Just like my ex-girlfriend
Honey, I know you're there
Please pick up the phone
Are you okay?
It's not funny
It's not fair
How can I atone?
Are you okay?
I lose control
But I can learn to behave
Give me one more chance
Let me be your slave
I'll kiss your Doc Martens
Let me kiss your Doc Martens
Your every wish I will obey
That might be okay.
Down, girl. Heel, stay.
I did a bit of research
With my friends at Legal Aid
Technically, you're squatters
There's hope
- But just in case
- Rope!
- We can hoist a line
- To the fire escape
- And tie off at that bench
- That bench
- I can't take them as chums
- Start hoisting, wench
I think I should be laughing
Yet I forget
Forget how to begin
I'm feeling something inside
And yet I still can't decide
If I should hide
Or make a wide-open grin
Last week I wanted just to disappear
My life was dust
But now it just may be
A happy new year
A happy new year
- Bond. James Bond.
- And Pussy Galore, in person.
Pussy, you came prepared.
I was a Boy Scout once,
and a Brownie...
...till some brat got scared.
- Moneypenny, my martini
- Will bad champagne do?
- That's shaken, not stirred
- Pussy, the bolts
Just say the word
Two minutes left to execute our plan
- Where's everyone else?
- Playing Spider-Man
Ironic close-up tight
On the phone machine's red light
Once the boho boys are gone
The power mysteriously comes on
Mark, it's the Wicked Witch
Of the West
Your mother
Happy New Year from Scarsdale
We're all impressed that the riot
Footage made the nightly news
Even your father says mazel tov
Honey, call him
Love, Mom
Mark Cohen, Alexi Darling
From Buzzline
Oh, that show's so sleazy.
Your footage of the riots, A-one
Feature segment, network, deal time
I'm sending you a contract
Ker-ching, ker-ching
Marky, give us a call
Or at home try 863-6754
Or my cell phone at 919-555-0090
Or you can e-mail me
At Darling Alexi Newscom. net
Or you can page me at-
- I think we need an agent
- We?
- That's selling out
- But it's nice to dream
Yeah! It's network TV
And it's all thanks to me
Somehow I think I smell the whiff
Of a scheme
Me too.
- We can plan another protest
- We?
This time you can shoot from the start
And you'll direct, starring me!
Five, four, three, open sesame
Happy New Year
Happy New Year
Happy New...
I see that you've beaten me
To the punch
- How did you know we'd be here?
- I had a hunch
- You're not mad?
- I'm here to end this war
It's a shame you went
And destroyed the door
Why all of a sudden
The big about-face?
The credit's yours
You made a good case
Mimi came to see me
She had much to say
That's not how you put it
At all yesterday
I couldn't stop thinking
About the whole mess
- Mark, you'd wanna get this on film.
- I guess.
I regret the unlucky circumstances
Of the past seven days
Circumstance?
You padlocked our door
And it's with great pleasure
On behalf of CyberArts
- That I hand you this key
- Golf claps
- I had no juice in my battery
- Reshoot
Oh, I see
This is a photo opportunity
The benevolent god ushers
the poor artists back to their flat.
Planning on taking
the barbed wire from the lot?
- Anything but that
- Clearing the lot was a safety concern
We break ground this month
But you can return
That's why you're here
With people you hate
Instead of with Muffy
At Muffy's estate
I'd honestly rather be with you tonight
Than in Westport
- Spare us, sport, the sound bite.
- Mimi, since you're so seductive
Persuade him not to be
So counterproductive
- Tell them what you wore to my place
- I was on my way to work
Black leather and lace
My desk was a mess, I'm still sore
I kicked him
And told him I wasn't his whore
Your boyfriend know
Who your last boyfriend was?
I'm not her boyfriend.
I don't care what she does.
People, is this any way to start
A new year? Have compassion
- Benny just lost his cat
- My dog, but I appreciate that
My cat had a fall
I went through hell
Like losing-
How'd you know that she fell?
- Champagne?
- Don't mind if I do
- To dogs
- No, Benny, to you!
- Let's make a resolution
- I'll drink to that
Let's always stay friends
- Though we may have our disputes
- This family tree's got deep roots
- Friendship is thicker than blood
- That depends
- Depends on trust
- It depends on true devotion
- Depends on love
- Depends on not denying emotion
Perhaps.
- It's gonna be a happy new year
- I guess
It's gonna be a happy new year
- You're right
- It's gonna be a happy new year
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.
- Coming?
- In a minute, I'm fine, go
Well, well, well.
What have we here?
It's gonna be a happy New Year
There, there. There, there.
Valentine's Day.
Pan across the empty lot.
Roger's down at Mimi's, where he's
been for almost two months now.
Although, he keeps talking
about selling his guitar...
...and heading out of town.
Still jealous of Benny.
God knows where Collins
and Angel are.
Could be that new shantytown
near the river or a suite at the Plaza.
Maureen and Joanne
are rehearsing.
- I said, once more from the top!
- I said, no!
That is, if they're speaking
this week.
Me? I'm here.
Nowhere.
The line is, "CyberArts
and its corporate sponsor...
...Grey Communications, wish
to mitigate the Christmas Eve riots. "
- What is so difficult about that?
- It just doesn't roll off my tongue.
I like my version.
You, dressed as a groundhog
to protest the groundbreaking?
- It's a metaphor.
- It's less than brilliant.
- That's it, Miss Ivy League.
- What?
Ever since New Year's,
I haven't said boo.
I let you direct.
Didn't pierce my nipples
because it grossed you out.
I didn't dance that night
because you wanted to go home.
You were flirting with the woman
in rubber!
That's what this is about?
There will always be women
in rubber flirting with me.
Give me a break.
Every single day
I walk down the street
I hear people say, "Baby"
It's so sweet
Ever since puberty
Everybody stares at me
Boys, girls, I can't help it, baby
So be kind
And don't lose your mind
Just remember that I'm your baby
Take me for what I am
Who I was meant to be
And if you give a damn
Take me, baby, or leave me
Take me, baby, or leave me
A tiger in a cage
Can never see the sun
This diva needs her stage
Baby, let's have fun
You are the one I choose
Folks would kill to fill your shoes
You love
The limelight too, baby
So be mine
Or don't waste my time
Crying, "Oh, honey bear
Are you still my baby?"
Take me for what I am
Who I was meant to be
And if you give a damn
Take me, baby, or leave me
No way can I be what I'm not
But, hey, don't you want
Your girl hot?
Don't fight
Don't lose your head
'Cause every night
Who's in your bed?
Who?
Who's in your bed?
- Kiss, Pookie.
- It won't work.
I look before I leap
I love margins and discipline
I make lists in my sleep, baby
What's my sin?
Never quit
I follow through
I hate mess
But I love you
What to do
With my impromptu baby?
So be wise
'Cause this girl satisfies
You got a prize
So don't compromise
You're one lucky baby
Take me for what I am
A control freak.
Who I was meant to be
A snob, yet overattentive.
And if you give a damn
A lovable, droll geek.
Take me, baby, or leave me
An anal-retentive.
- That's it
- That's it
The straw that breaks my back
- I quit
- I quit
Unless you take it back
- Women
- Women
What is it about them?
- Can't live with them or without them
- Can't live with them or without them
- Take me for what I am
- Take me for what I am
- Who I was meant to be
- Who I was meant to be
- And if you give a damn
- And if you give a damn
You better take me, baby
- Oh, take me, baby
- Or leave me
Take me or leave me
- Take me, baby
- Take me, baby
- Or leave me
- Or leave me
- Guess I'm leaving
- Guess I'm leaving
- I'm gone
- I'm gone
In diapers, report cards
In spoked wheels, in speeding tickets
In contracts, dollars
In funerals, in births
In 525,600 minutes
How do you figure
A last year on Earth?
Figure in love
Figure in love
Figure in love
Measure in love
Seasons of love
Seasons of love
- Where were you?
- Sorry.
No, you lost your keys.
No, you went for a walk.
Had to help your mother.
- How's Benny?
- Baby-
- I'm working upstairs tonight.
- Wait.
I should tell you
I should-
Never mind.
Happy Spring.
Without you
The ground thaws
The rain falls
The grass grows
Without you
The seeds root
The flowers bloom
The children play
The stars gleam
The poets dream
The eagles fly
Without you
The Earth turns
The sun burns
But I die without you
Without you
The breeze warms
The girl smiles
The cloud moves
Without you
The tides change
The boys run
The oceans crash
The crowds roar
The days soar
The babies cry
Without you
The moon glows
The river flows
But I die without you
The world revives
Colors renew
- But I know blue
- But I know blue
- Only blue
- Only blue
- Lonely blue
- Lonely blue
Within me, blue
Without you
Without you
The hand gropes
The ear hears
The pulse beats
Without you
The eyes gaze
The legs walk
The lungs breathe
- The mind churns
- The mind churns
- The heart yearns
- The heart yearns
- The tears dry
- The tears dry
- Without you
- Without you
- Life goes on
- Life goes on
- But I'm gone
- But I'm gone
- 'Cause I die without you
- 'Cause I die
Without you
Without you
- Without you
- Without you
- Speak.
- Speak.
Mark Cohen, Alexi Darling
Labor Day weekend in East Hampton
On the beach
Just saw Alec Baldwin
Told him you said hi
Just kidding
We need directors
You still need money
You know you need money
Pick up the phone
Don't be afraid of ker-ching, ker-ching
Marky, sell us your soul
Just kidding
We're waiting
- Yes.
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
Yeah, right there.
- You got it.
- Oh, you're gonna make me come.
Yeah, right there. Keep doing that.
Oh, yeah.
Hot, hot, hot, sweat, sweet
Wet, wet, wet, red heat
Hot, hot, hot, sweat, sweet
Wet, wet, wet, red heat
Please, don't stop, please
Please, don't stop, stop
Stop, stop, stop
Please, please
- Please
- Harder
- Faster
- Wetter
- Bastard
- You whore
- More
- You animal
- Sticky, licky, trickle, tickle
- Fluid, no fluid, no contact, yes
- Steamy, creamy, stroking, soaking
- Fire, fire, burn, burn
No latex rubber, rubber
Fire, latex rubber, latex bummer
Lover bummer
Take me, take me, take me
Take me, take me
Today for you
Tomorrow for me
Today me
Tomorrow you
Tomorrow you
Love you, love, love you
Love you, I love you
I love you
Take me, take me, take me
Take me, yeah
- Wait
- Slipped
- Shit
- Where'd it go?
- Safe
- Damn
I think I missed
Don't get pissed
It was bad for me
Was it bad for you?
- It's over
- It's over
- It's over
- It's over
It's over.
Angel was one of my closest friends.
It's right that it's Halloween
because it was her favorite holiday.
I knew we'd hit it off
the moment we met.
That skinhead was bothering her...
...and she said she was more of a man
than he'd ever be...
...and more of a woman
than he'd ever get.
And then there was a time...
...he walked up
to this group of tourists...
...and they were petrified...
...because, A, they were
obviously lost...
...and, B, had probably never spoken
to a drag queen before in their lives.
And he...
She...
...just offered to escort them
out of Alphabet City...
...and then she let them
take a picture with her...
...and then she said she'd help them
find the Circle Line.
So much more original
than any of us.
You'd find an old tablecloth
on the street and make a dress...
...and next year,
sure enough...
...they'd be mass-producing
them at the Gap.
You always said how lucky
you were that we were all friends...
...but it was us, baby...
...who were the lucky ones.
Live in my house
I'll be your shelter
Just pay me back
With 1000 kisses
Be my lover
And I'll cover you
Open your door
I'll be your tenant
Don't got much baggage
To lay at your feet
But sweet kisses I've got to spare
I'll be there and I'll cover you
I think they meant it
When they said you can't buy love
Now I know you can rent it
A new lease you are, my love
On life
All my life
I've longed to discover
Something as true as this is
So with a thousand sweet kisses
If you're cold and you're lonely
With a thousand sweet kisses
- You've got one nickel only
- I'll cover you
With a thousand sweet kisses
- When you're worn-out and tired
- I'll cover you
With a thousand sweet kisses
When your heart has expired
Oh, lover
- I'll cover you
- Yes, I will
- Yes, I will
- Yes, I will
Oh, yes, I will
Oh, lover
I'll cover you
Five hundred twenty-five thousand
Seasons of
- Love
- I will cover you
Hi, it's Mark Cohen.
Is Alexi there?
No need to bother her.
Just let her know I'm running
a little late for my appointment.
I'm at my...
Yes, I'll still be there.
Yes, I signed the contract.
Thanks.
How did we get here?
How the hell?
Pan left
Close on the steeple of the church
How did I get here?
How the hell?
Christmas
Christmas Eve last year
How could a night so frozen
Be so scalding hot?
How can a morning this mild
Be so raw?
Why are entire years strewn
On the cutting-room floor of memory
When single frames
From one magic night
Forever flicker in close-up
On the 3-D Imax of my mind?
That's poetic
That's pathetic
Why did Mimi knock on Roger's door
And Collins choose that phone booth
Back where Angel set up his drums?
Why did Maureen's equipment
Break down?
Why am I the witness?
And when I capture it on film
Will it mean that it's the end
And I'm alone?
It's true you sold your guitar
And bought a car?
It's true
I'm leaving now for Santa Fe
It's true you're with
This yuppie scum?
You said you'd never
Speak to him again
- Not now
- Who said that you have any say
- In who she says things to at all?
- Yeah.
Who said that you should stick
Your nose in other people-?
Who said I was talking to you?
- We used to have this fight each night
- Calm down
- She'd never admit I existed
- Everyone, please
He was the same way
He was always
Run away, hit the road, don't commit
You're full of shit
- She's in denial
- He's in denial
Didn't give an inch
When I gave a mile
- I gave a mile
- Gave a mile to who?
- Don't you dare come at me.
- Come on, guys, chill.
I'd be happy to die
For a taste of what Angel had
- Someone to live for
- Someone to live for
- Unafraid to say, "I love you"
- Unafraid to say, "I love you"
All your words are nice, Mimi
But love's not a three-way street
You'll never share real love
Until you love yourself
I should know
You all said you'd be cool today
So please, for my sake
I can't believe he's gone
I can't believe you're going
I can't believe this family must die
Angel helped us believe in love
I can't believe you disagree
I can't believe this is
Goodbye
- Pookie.
- Honey bear.
- I missed you so much.
- I missed you.
- I missed your smell.
- I missed your mouth.
- What?
- Nothing, Pookie.
No. No, baby, you said, "Ow. "
What is it?
You bit my tongue.
- No, I didn't.
- Yes. It's bleeding.
I think I should know.
- Let me see. I was just try-
- She doesn't believe me.
Thomas B. Collins?
Coming.
I hear there are great restaurants
Out West
Some of the best
How could she?
How could you let her go?
You just don't know
How could we lose Angel?
Maybe you'll see why
When you stop escaping your pain
At least now if you try
Angel's death won't be in vain
His death is in vain
Are you insane?
There's so much to care about
There's me, there's Mimi
Mimi's got her baggage too
So do you
Who are you to tell me
What I know and what to do?
- A friend
- But who, Mark, are you?
"Mark has got his work"
They say, "Mark lives for his work"
And, "Mark's in love with his work"
- Mark hides in his work
- From what?
From facing your failure
Facing your loneliness
Facing the fact you live a lie
Yes, you live a lie
Tell you why
You're always preaching
Not to be numb
When that's how you thrive
You pretend to create and observe
When you really detach
From feeling alive
Perhaps it's because
I'm the one of us to survive
Poor baby!
Mimi still loves Roger
Is Roger really jealous
Or afraid that Mimi's weak?
Mimi did look pale
Mimi's gotten thin
Mimi's running out of time
Roger's running out the door
No more
Oh, no, I gotta go
Hey, for someone
Who's always been let down
Who's heading out of town?
For someone who longs
For a community of his own
Who's with his camera, alone?
I'll call
I hate the fall
You heard?
Every word
You don't want baggage
Without lifetime guarantees
You don't want to watch me die
I just came to say
Goodbye, love
Goodbye, love
Came to say goodbye, love
Goodbye
Just came to say
- Goodbye, love
- Glory
- Goodbye, love
- One blaze of glory
Came to say goodbye, love
- Goodbye
- I have to find
Please don't touch me
Understand
I'm scared
I need to go away
- I know a place, a clinic
- A rehab?
Maybe
Could you?
I'll pay
Goodbye, love
Goodbye, love
Came to say goodbye, love
Goodbye
Just came to say
Goodbye, love
Goodbye, love
Goodbye, love
Hello, disease
Off the premises now
We give no handouts here
- What happened to "rest in peace"?
- Off the premises, queer
That's no way to send a boy
To meet his maker
They had to know
We couldn't pay the undertaker
Don't you worry about him
Hey, I'll take care of it
- Must be nice to have money.
- No shit.
I think it only fair to tell you...
...you just paid for the funeral
of the person who killed your dog.
I know. I always hated that dog.
Let's pay him off and then get drunk.
I can't. I have a meeting.
- Punk. Let's go.
- Punk. Let's go.
Hi. Mark Cohen here for Buzzline.
Back to you, Alexi.
Coming up next, vampire
welfare queens...
...who are compulsive bowlers.
Oh, my God. What am I doing?
Don't breathe too deep
Don't think all day
Dive into work
Drive the other way
That drip of hurt
That pint of shame
Goes away
Just play the game
You're living in America
At the end of the millennium
You're living in America
Leave your conscience at the tone
And when you're living in America
At the end of the millennium
You're what you own
The filmmaker cannot see
And the songwriter cannot hear
Yet I see Mimi everywhere
Angel's voice is in my ear
Just tighten those shoulders
Just clench your jaw till you frown
Just don't let go
- Or you may drown
- Or you may drown
- You're living in America
- You're living in America
- At the end of the millennium
- At the end of the millennium
- You're living in America
- You're living in America
- Where it's like The Twilight Zone
- Where it's like The Twilight Zone
- And when you're living in America
- And when you're living in America
- At the end of the millennium
- At the end of the millennium
- You're what you own
- You're what you own
- So I own not a notion
- So I own not a notion
- I escape and ape content
- I escape and ape content
- I don't own emotion
- I don't own emotion
- I rent
- I rent
- What was it about that night?
- What was it about that night?
- Connection in an isolating age
- Connection in an isolating age
- For once the shadows
- For once the shadows
- Gave way to light
- Gave way to light
- For once I didn't disengage
- For once I didn't disengage
- Angel, I hear you, I hear it, I see it
- Mimi, I see you
- I see it, my film
- I see it, I hear it, I hear it, my song
- Alexi, Mark. Call me a hypocrite...
- One song, glory
- ... I need to finish my own film. I quit.
- Mimi, your eyes
- Dying in America
- Dying in America
- At the end of the millennium
- At the end of the millennium
- We're dying in America
- We're dying in America
- To come into our own
- To come into our own
- And when you're dying in America
- And when you're dying in America
- At the end of the millennium
- At the end of the millennium
- You're not alone
- You're not alone
- I'm not alone
- I'm not alone
- I'm not alone
- I'm not alone
- Speak.
- Speak.
Roger, this is your mother
Roger, honey
I don't get these postcards
"Moving to Santa Fe"
"Back in New York
Starting a rock band"
Roger, where are you?
Roger, where are you?
Roger, where are you?
Roger, where are you?
Kitten, wherever are you?
Kitten, wherever are you?
Kitten, wherever are you?
Mark, are you there? Are you there?
I don't know if-
Please
Call
Your mother
- Christmas bells are ringing
- Christmas bells are ringing
Christmas bells are ringing
How time flies
When compassion dies
No stockings, no candy canes
No gingerbread, no safety net
No loose change
No change, no
- Santy Claus is coming
- 'Cause Santy Claus ain't coming
No room at the Holiday Inn again
Well, maybe next year
Or when
December 24th, 10 p. m.
Eastern Standard Time
I can't believe a year
Went by so fast
Time to see
What we have time to see
Turn the projector on.
First shot, Roger
With the Fender guitar
He just got out of hock
When he sold the car
That took him away and back
I found my song
He found his song
If he could just find Mimi
I tried. You know I tried.
Fade in on Mark
Who's still in the dark
- But he's got great footage
- Which he's cut together
To screen tonight.
- In honor of Benny's wife
- Muffy
Allison
Pulling Benny
Out of the East Village location
Then again,
maybe we won't screen it tonight.
I wonder how Allison
found out about Mimi?
Maybe a little bird told her.
Or an angel.
I had a little hunch
That you could use a little flow
- Tutoring again?
- Negative
- Back at NYU?
- No, no, no
I rewired the ATM
At The Food Emporium
To provide an honorarium
To anyone with the code
The code
- Well?
- Well?
A- N-G-E-L.
Yet Robin Hooding
Isn't the solution
The powers that be
Must be undermined where they dwell
In a small, exclusive
Gourmet institution
Where we overcharge
The wealthy clientele
Let's open up a restaurant
In Santa Fe
With a private corner banquette
In the back
We'll make it yet
We'll somehow get to Santa Fe
But you'd miss New York
Before you could unpack
Mark! Roger! Anyone, help!
- Maureen?
- It's Mimi!
We can't get her up the stairs!
No!
She was huddled in the park
In the dark
And she was freezing
And begged to come here
- Over here? Oh, God.
- Yeah.
Got a light? I know you
You're shivering
- She's been living on the street
- We need some heat
- I'm shivering.
- Okay.
We can buy some wood
And something to eat
I'm afraid she needs more than heat
I heard that
Collins will call for a doctor, honey
Don't waste your money on me
Hello, 911? I'm on hold.
Cold, cold
Would you light my candle?
Yes- Oh, God
Find a candle
I should tell you
I should tell you
I should tell you
I should tell you
I should tell you
Benny wasn't anything-
I know
I should tell you why I left
- It wasn't 'cause I didn't-
- I know
- I should tell you
- I should tell you
I should tell you, I love you
Who do you think you are?
Leaving me alone with my guitar
Hold on, there's something
You should hear
It isn't much, but it took all year
Your eyes
As we said our goodbyes
Can't get them out of my mind
And I find
I can't hide
From your eyes
The ones that took me by surprise
The night you came into my life
Where there's moonlight
I see your eyes
How'd I let you slip away
When I'm longing so to hold you?
Now I'd die for one more day
'Cause there's something
I should have told you
Yes, there's something
I should have told you
When I looked into your eyes
Why does distance make us wise?
You were the song all along
And before this song dies
I should tell you
I should tell you
I have always loved you
You can see it in my eyes
Mimi
- I jumped over the moon.
- What?
A leap of:
She's back.
I was in a tunnel...
...headed for this warm, white light.
Oh, my God.
And I swear...
...Angel was there.
And she looked good.
And she said:
"Turn around, girlfriend...
...and listen to that boy's song. "
She's drenched.
Her fever's breaking
There is no future
There is no past
Thank God this moment's
Not the last
- There's only us
- There's only us
- There's only this
- There's only this
- Forget regret
- Forget regret
Or life is yours to miss
No other road
No other way
No day but today
- I can't control
- Will I lose my dignity?
- My destiny
- Will someone care?
- I trust my soul
- Will I wake tomorrow
My only goal
- Is just to be
- From this nightmare?
- Without you
- There's only now
- The hand gropes
- There's only here
- The ear hears
- Give in to love
- The pulse beats
- Or live in fear
- Life goes on
- No other path
- But I'm gone
- No other way
- 'Cause I die without you
- No day but today
- I die without you
- No day but today
- I die without you
- No day but today
- I die without you
- No day but today
- I die without you
- No day but today
- I die without you
- No day but today
No day but today

Measure a year?
In daylights, in sunsets
In midnights, in cups of coffee
In inches, in miles
In laughter, in strife
In 525,600 minutes
How do you measure
A year in the life?
How about love?

How about love?
Measure in love

How do you measure
The life of a woman or a man?
In truths that she learned?
Or in times that he cried?
In bridges he burned?
- Or the way that she died?
- It's time now to sing out
Though the story never ends
Let's celebrate
Remember a year in the life of friends
Remember the love
Oh, you got to
You got to remember the love
You know that love is a gift
From up above
Give love, give love, spread love
Measure, measure your life in love
