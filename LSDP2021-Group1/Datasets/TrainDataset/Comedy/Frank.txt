Hmmm.
endless
Where will
you carry me to?
Children building
castles in the sand
a band's playing
tomorrow night
They're called the...
The Soron...
Ladies have babies
That's how it works.
Lady in the red coat,
what you doing with that bag?
do you know the lady
in the red coat?
- Oh.
Hi. Just in time. I
made a casserole.
Oh, er, no, thanks. I've
got an idea for a song.
- How was work?
- Yeah, it was good.
I... I've just...
Before I forget it.
Okay, idea for a song
in "a" minor,
possible title "suburbia."
I dream...
Of an angel...
down to "E" in the bass.
To take
Me away...
To "G."
take
Me away...
"C."
From these
little boxes...
Back to "a."
I dream
of an angel...
Up there.
to take...
Oh, hang on.
me away...
Oh fuck.
That's madness.
A fucking madness song.
Uh, but not Johnston or Harman.
Um, so how would you
describe the, er, Soron...
How would you
describe your music?
Thank you
for your inquiry, Anthony.
That's a pretty fucking
boring question.
I would describe our
sound as fucking happy.
Clara, why don't you just let him speak?
Fuck you, Lucas!
- Cheese and ham panini.
There you go.
It's him.
I'm gonna do it!
I mean it.
This is your fault!
- This is all on you!
- Okay.
- Would you at least look at me?
- Get out of the water.
or... I don't know,
I guess a physical fight.
You're the s...
You're playing tonight.
How?
Our keyboardist is trying
to drown himself.
Fuck off! I'm not just
fingers, you know.
I play keyboards.
She wanted this... she wanted
this from the start!
Oh no no, I wasn't...
That wasn't, uh... I...
Yeah yeah.
Red hair.
Okay.
Ahem.
You play "C," "F" and "G"?
- Yeah.
- You're in.
- really?
Sir.
Should we run through the songs?
Stage door,
Uh, okay, let me give
you my number.
He'll be fine.
He'll still need
to spend the night
in hospital though, right? He
swallowed a lot of seawater.
He'll have to have
his stomach pumped.
In the soup
cover him in grease
Raw limby sausage
salted joints
Tuna in brine
Deep dark swell anoints...
Undertow the broken Ford
Back to garage,
help him, lord...
Eels are jellied,
bloated belly
Scallops seared,
wrinkled skin
Comb the cockles
from his beard
Notify the next of kin
Push the baby, cut the cord
Spread the feast
upon the board...
Coming out, emerging...
What happened?
You just stopped playing.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Just stop fucking playing!?
Bullshit!
There. The backup is bullshit!
Fucking bullshit!
It's okay, come on.
Come on.
Start up the car.
Hello. So Lucas has
been sectioned
and we need a new
keyboard player.
And Frank said, you know, "remember
that grateful-looking boy
who jumped on the stage
last week uninvited?"
I wasn't uninvited.
- Hello?
-
something cherishable
that night.
But he can sound really muffled
under the head so...
I thought he said
that you brought
You know, like food
that decays easily,
-
- Mm-hmm.
"come on, man,
anybody can do that."
So anyways, we're doing
this really major thing
over in Ireland.
Are you in?
- Yes.
-
what's happening
to me right now."
Hello!
I wasn't sure where to wait.
Clacket Lane's pretty
labyrinthine, isn't it?
I was gonna stand by the... the
bank of Scotland Cashline...
You know, next to the R.A.C.
Membership stall there...
But, er... you know, I thought I'd
be more visible on the approach.
So I just decided
to come straight...
Hello. Oh.
Hi. Hi, everybody.
Hi. I was just
saying to don that
I didn't know where to stand 'cause I thought
that you might not see me, so, um...
- I have a certificate.
- This way, please.
It's an official
medical document.
Certificate. You'll note
the official stamp.
It's all legal and above board.
So, uh, what do you
think of Frank?
- Light me.
Fucking amazing, isn't he?
Frank, you're on fire.
-
- I'm on fire.
-
- On the furthest corners.
Fuck, I wanna be Frank.
- Don?
- Yeah.
It smells
like sausages.
- Never?
- No, never.
- He sleeps in it?
- Yep.
- What about eating?
He sucks liquid food
through a straw
that he funnels up
under the neckline.
Occasionally solids,
but it's not encouraged.
- What kind of liquid food?
- Grownut.
-
- He must have a very bushy beard.
- Not necessarily.
- How does he clean his teeth?
Look, Jon, you're just
gonna have to go with this.
Okay.
Sorry, it's just...
- It's pretty crazy, isn't it?
-
I understand.
I understand.
But let me tell you something...
Frank, with all his issues,
is without a doubt the most
Okay.
Me, on the other hand...
Well, you seem
pretty sane to me.
Yeah!
I spent a lot of time
in a psychiatric hospital.
I was labeled
as severely mentally ill.
I used to fuck mannequins.
- Right.
- It's a condition.
Here we go.
Wakey-wakey,
eggs and bakey.
And everybody out.
Welcome to Vetno...
Don?
- Don!
- All right.
You like?-
- impulse response.
- Okay, people.
- Excuse me.
-
How long will we be
staying here for?
...rhythm section shall be
housed in here. Ah, bunks.
Frank. The master
bedroom for you.
Had it customized
for all your requirements.
These will be the
bathing accommodations.
We will have many
productive seasons here.
And, Clara, your living quarters.
Don!
Nice panoramic view
of the lake here.
And, Jon, you and I
are just through here.
- Don.
- Yeah, buddy?
Don, sorry, I, uh...
I actually told work
that I'd be back on Monday.
Uh, so I was just wondering...
Why the fuck would you do that?
Well, I thought it was
just a gig, you know.
So I've only brought one
pair of pants and a t-shirt.
This is where I'll be staying,
right here in the green trailer.
So if you need anything
at night... you know,
sugar, milk...
If you freak out,
you just come a-knocking.
Come on, chop chop.
- That's alpine cedar... nice.
- Don!
- Yeah?
- How long are we staying here?
Just as long as it takes
to record the album, Jon.
After several days of what
Frank calls 'fieldwork, '
rehearsals proper
have begun."
and gradually getting to know
my fellow band members."
Wow, this is beautiful.
What do you call it?
Stay away from
my fucking theremin.
"A few teething problems,
as you would expect.
-
- Hey.
Mm-hmm.
a palpable sense
of free expression,
and I can't wait to dive
into the creative maelstrom."
Okay, everybody, next time
round go to "G" minor,
okay?
One two three four!
"But of course,
I shall have to earn
- Whoo whoo!
-
- Stop!
- It will be worth it!
"He can hide himself away
for days at a time.
What goes on
inside that head..."
- Jackpot!
-
Yes!
It's like an aviary.
Your birds rock.
You're a cormorant.
Nana...
Moorhen.
Clara, the owl...
Night hunter, silent killer.
What have we got here?
Lay an egg for me,
little ginger bird.
Lay an egg!
-
- Lay an egg with me.
"...and unlock the great music
that hides there."
- Get down there. Squat!
- Uh...
- Er, okay.
- Go on, lay an egg.
Get that egg out.
Squeeze that egg out.
"It can feel a little
overwhelming at times."
It has no business in there.
- I don't wanna be me!
- Go back inside!
- I don't wanna be me!
- Please, come with me back.
- Come on.
- Frank, just let me go!
-
- I don't wanna live!
Don't let him get to the lake!
- Uh...
-
- I'm free, I'm free!
- Please, don!
I'm free!
Wait wait, don.
- Oh.
- Don, don't get up.
I don't wanna be me.
Did he tell you
about the mannequins?
I met one once.
Caroline Cuntley.
- I'm Frank.
- I'm Jon.
Does he still...?
He has relationships
with real women now.
But it's hard, you know.
He has to convince them
to lie completely still,
Hey, don't tell don I...
I said anything.
- No.
-
I say tell everyone everything.
Why cover anything up?
Right?
Can I ask you something?
Sure.
Why do you wear that?
You think it's weird?
- Kinda.
-
you know,
the way they're smooth,
smooth, smooth...
And then blech!
You know?
All bumpy and holes.
I mean, what are eyes like?
It's like
a science-fiction movie.
Don't get me started on lips.
- Like the edges of a very serious wound.
-
But your head is still
sort of intimidating.
Well, underneath I'm giving
you a welcoming smile.
Would it help if I said my
facial expressions out loud?
Well, maybe.
Welcoming smile.
You've been up all night talking
to the keyboard player?
I'm not just a keyboard player.
I write songs too. You
write your own songs?
Mm-hmm.
I'd love to play some
for you sometime.
I'd really like that.
Big non-threatening grin.
- Delighted look.
- Here, play one now.
-
- Play one now.
- Excellent.
- Um, not... not right now.
- Okay?
- No no.
- I'd love to hear one of your songs.
- I would too.
- Go on.
- I... I don't think so, guys.
Please!
Hey, guys, Jon...
He writes his own music.
He's gonna play
some music for us.
I...
- Clara.
- Share your music with us, Jon.
- Um...
Okay.
But I haven't
warmed up my hands.
Um, okay, um...
That's just... that's
a warm-up.
Um...
I've got one...
I've got one that's like...
I was walking down
the street one day
Thinking about
the lady I love
When a guy comes down
And says,
"what do you do?"
No, that's not... I haven't
finished that one.
I've got a kind of a rocky one.
LA-LA...
Lady in the red coat,
what you doing with that bag?
I've only... fuck, you know when
you've just got so many songs
and then just none of them'll
fucking come out?
Oh no, I've got one.
I've got one.
There's one which is like, um...
That's yours.
- Oh, man.
- Little bit.
- Why?
I don't think I've ever
been able to find my...
Core song-writing themes.
- You know?
- You can write a song about anything.
-
- Yeah.
Hey. Like your socks here.
They're pretty original.
Hey, look at this.
This little tuft in the carpet.
I wonder how old he is
in carpet years?
Is it spring? Mmm.
He's the first to wake?
Or... is he old,
to keep what winter
wants to take?
Lone standing tuft
Defies the foot
Is it luck that
you're still standing?
You've not been
flattened, too
Do you tremble beneath
the gentle breeze
That's displaced
by my shoe?
Lone standing tuft.
- Frank.
That's amazing.
Flattered grin, followed
by a bashful half-smile.
No, people should
know about you.
You should be famous.
You understand.
- I understand what?
- Understand that there are
people out there
that might like our music.
Sometimes I think Clara
doesn't care if people
like us or not.
- Really?
- It's weird.
It's really weird.
- What is this?
- Potato.
And what is this?
Stew.
You should go home.
Frank picked me, okay?
So it's not up to you.
- Excuse me?
- He said I was cherishable,
and he picked me
to join the band.
You are fingers being told
which keys to push.
- I push my own keys.
- 10 little bits
of bone and skin.
And I'm perfectly capable
of going to my furthest corners
and composing music.
- Your furthest corners?
- My furthest corners.
Someone needs to punch you
in the face.
as if to say
"enough frivolity."
Today...
We begin work
on the album in earnest.
- everything from scratch."
- Note the color-coding.
"He's created an entirely
new musical notation system."
...the entire universe,
like tiny little galaxies...
"We've designed
our own instruments."
"He has initiated
a strict regime
Oh, for fuck's sake!
"Fortunately, we have
a safe word for when
-
- Chinchilla, chinchilla!
Chinchilla, chinchilla!
Frank finds inspiration
in everything."
- I find this inspiring.
-
We could make an entire album
out of this one sound.
"I dedicate myself
to learning his secret
and I will not let anybody
get in my way,
however desperately
they may try."
Somebody's thinking in the
key of "C." Oh, it's me!
Oh, fuck!
Chinchilla.
- Keep going!
- Okay.
- Keep going!
-
that this band,
whether they realize it or not,
"I will show them
what I am capable of.
- Hey.
-
I'm composing a song.
Oh, right.
Mmm.
Yeah, man.
I know.
- What?
- I know what it feels like
to try and write a song
and it just comes out shit.
Here's a little
love song I wrote
a long long long time ago.
The stillness
Of the winter night
The frozen water's
Icy skin
Is broken by
the boatman's oar
Be still and let me in
oh, let me in
But stay still.
There, see?
Shit too.
But look, Jon,
sooner or later you're
gonna get the feeling,
"why can't I be Frank?"
Or "maybe I can be Frank."
But, Jon, there can
only be one Frank.
One.
Actually, don,
I think both our songs
were excellent.
Yeah.
Right? Come on,
let's go for a walk.
Yeah, I've known
Frank was special
since the moment
I first saw him.
This nurse was trying
to wrestle his head off.
I mean, the guy must
have weighed 300 lbs.
Frank was freaking out so
hard, he just backed off.
- A mental hospital?
- Mmm.
Have you ever seen him
without the head?
God, no.
Maybe he's facially disfigured,
forced to wear a mask
like the elephant man.
Hmm. All I know is that
he told me once
he was from Kansas...
Bluff, Kansas.
Bluff, Kansas.
Sounds dark.
'Cuzzi?
Naw.
Get back to work.
Miserable childhood,
mental illness...
Where do I find
that kind of inspiration?
You've made the first step
towards releasing
your creativity in a way
that will change
Take everyday activities
like shaving.
As Edward DE Bono once said,
how often does someone
using a traditional wet razor
stop to consider whether
instead of moving the razor,
it might be easier
to keep the razor still
What is that?
I think it's called
"the idiot shriek."
- Such pain.
- Hey.
- Such emptiness.
- Hey!
Shit!
What?!
Easy, don.
Start again...
From the beginning.
Patient smile.
Stop saying your facial
expressions out loud.
- It's extremely annoying.
We've run out of time.
We've spent all
of our rent money
and the landlord gave us
And we didn't leave,
so now they've rented vetno to
a family of holidaymakers...
Who are right over there.
Why didn't you tell us?
I didn't wanna disappoint you.
- I can pay.
- What?
- When my grandfather died,
I inherited money.
He said it was my nest egg.
He said I should only ever spend my
nest egg on something really important.
I want you guys
to have my nest egg.
Oh, Jon.
Thank you.
Oh, ginger bird.
It'll buy us enough time
to make the album.
Shit. What do
we do about them?
Fucking crazy lady.
"We've been working
on the new music
Again.
"None of us has left vetno
since we got here."
Again.
"Frank refuses
to record the album
-
- Again!
Oh.
a lot more
than I anticipated."
Come!
"We've had to start
rationing the food."
Thanks.
Fuck off.
- Thief!
- "...Remains as strong
- I want it back. I want it all back.
- No!
Those are my
keyboard-playing fingers.
"I'll admit there
have been times
when I've considered
leaving vetno,
-
- Morning.
- Hey.
-
how many of you continue
to join me on this journey.
You know, despite all the
hardships I've suffered here..."
"...something inside me
is beginning to stir.
I have found
my abusive childhood..."
- Oh God.
-
This is really good.
Frank. Frank, I've...
Dog-leg left,
Oh. Oh, um...
I've written a song.
And it goes up.
Yeah.
Amazing.
Really?
- Yeah.
-
Oh, that means the world
to me, thank you so much.
- Do you mind?
- Please.
- Okay, so pare that down.
- Mm-hmm.
Now go up a half.
Go up a whole.
- Mmm.
- Now go back down.
That's fantastic.
Uh-huh.
- That's excellent.
- Here.
- Yeah, uh-huh.
- Right?
- Yeah, right.
- 'Cause what were you playing before?
- That was like an "F."
- "F" yeah.
You play "F" there,
that'd be shit.
- Yeah, let's make that stomp a bit more.
- Okay.
Vetno tapes, take one.
Comet tail
Screeching infrequencies
of pulsing infinities
where the sap is collected,
the process perfected
The galactic siren
sounds...
Down the dimensions
Of curled-up strings
inside the point
Get out the path
of the king!
Mr. Laurel
Get out the path of the king!
Mr. Hardy
Regret, get out the path
of the king!
They will not be able
to attend tonight's dinner
get out the path
of the king!
Yeah!
Secure the galactic
perimeter
Weak and strong
nuclear bonds...
Whoo-hoo!
Stab it, stab it, stab it.
when it's all over
Go back to the start...
Don?
We're done.
Hop to it! Oh, shite!
Over here!
Frank!
Get the rope off!
Bye, don.
You were the best
keyboard player we ever had.
The best man I ever knew.
Don used to be
the keyboard player?
First it was don,
then it was Lucas.
Now it's you.
Jon, what the fuck
are you doing?
So you've been posting
videos of us online?
That's not the point.
Because of those clips
we've been offered a really
fucking important gig.
You've been spying on us.
South by southwest.
In Texas.
It's very prestigious.
- They've got a new discoveries strand...
- That's ridiculous.
Come on, Frank.
Let's get you cleaned up.
Why does it say
"two-three-
seven-five-one"
at the bottom?
That's the number of people
who've watched the clip.
Two-three-
seven-five-one people
are interested in us?
It's like magic.
I told you we could be big.
Can't see anything
in this fucking...
What game are you playing?
Filling Frank's head
with these bullshit ideas.
I can't hear you over
the sound of the bubbles.
Fuck! How the fuck
do these fucking...
You've just pressed
the full-bubble-strength button.
They're on a timer.
You've just restarted.
-
- Leave Frank alone.
I know you want me to end up
like don or Lucas,
but that's not gonna be
my role in this band.
You are a mediocre child.
- Excuse me?!
-
You're like Joseph...
You keep him locked up like...
You're bindweed,
chickweed, pit tramp,
- abscess, absence, vacuum.
- ... Josef...
- What's his fucking name?!... Josef Fritzl!
- Middle management!
Cunt!
Oh, fucking hell!
Oh, fucking hell!
Oh oh God!
Ow ow!
Ow ow ow, oh fuck!
I'm fucking dying.
This is gonna be awkward.
What is?
Us, you know...
Together.
We will never be together.
Oh.
Mmm.
- Disgusting!
- Yeah, okay.
I get the point.
What does he look like?
I don't know.
Was it awful in
the mental hospital, Clara?
- How should I know?
- I assumed you were mentally ill.
- You did?
- Mm-hmm.
Oh.
So why are you so against us
finding an audience then,
if it's not because
you're mentally ill?
You're in love with Frank.
You love him and you're scared
that if other people love him,
- you'll lose him.
- And one day I'll take off my glasses,
and he'll really see me.
And we'll do big kisses.
Don't presume to tell me
how I think.
If you fuck everything up
in America,
I'll stab you.
It's just like
"Paris, Texas," isn't it?
It's definitely...
What you looking for?
Don.
Hey, don?
Hey, partner.
I remember you saying
that the desert here
was your favorite place
in the whole world...
After SeaWorld, San Diego.
I know you were homesick, don.
I know there were times
when you wanted
to come back here,
but you didn't because of me.
Well, you're home now, don.
I promise those
sacrifices you made
won't be in vain.
Jon has foretold of a night
some nights from now when,
thanks to a secret camera,
legions and multitudes
of already adoring fans
shall gather
and-and they shall
receive our music
- in rapture.
- Okay.
- Oh!
- It's grownut.
Frank, it's grownut.
-
- Oh, don.
It's fucking grownut!
- Looking good!
- Don't touch me.
- Oh, thank you.
Thank you. We're
playing the sunshine
day after tomorrow.
Frank!
- Hello.
- Something tells me that
you guys are the Soronprfbs.
- That's us.
- You're Jon.
- Yes, hi.
- So here are the festival passes.
And an information pack
and did Simone
pronounce your name right?
- Jon.
- No, the band's name.
Oh, actually I don't know.
Clara, how do we pronounce
the band's name?
- Listen, are you guys hungry?
Uh, yeah.
- Because we were gonna go get something to eat.
It's the best pancake house
in town.
There's open Mike.
It's gonna be awesome.
Awesome.
Awesome.
with my knee-socks
and Chelsea's beanie
Talking boyfriends
You guys have been
in the forest so long,
all this craziness has to be
kind of overwhelming, I guess.
No, we're cool
with that, you know.
I'm delighted to be
launching our album here.
Delighted look, you know.
Unique...
And exciting opportunity
you've given us
to finally play in front of people who
actually know and love us, you know.
Until now, our audiences
tend to be people who...
Who chance upon us,
and realize after a few minutes
- they don't like us.
- Frank!
Actually, I gotta tell you guys.
I mean, we know who you are.
Simone and me, we found you, but the
audience won't have heard of you yet.
They do not know and love us.
But more than 23,700 people
watched us on YouTube.
Oh, 23,000 hits
on YouTube is nothing.
They do not know us. Yeah,
those kind of views,
maybe one or two people
in the room will know you.
Maybe nobody. Half a million, that's
when you're onto something big.
We fucked it up. Okay, but
they're cool though, right?
- I mean they'll like us.
- They'll love you.
"Recent revelations have
raised serious questions
in the band about the reception
we can look forward to
"A hastily arranged warm-up
gig earlier this evening..."
"...did nothing
to steady the ship.
It turns out, I may be
closer to the zeitgeist
than certain people
gave me credit for.
I am ready to make
my mark on this band."
So you want us
to change our sound?
Look, we've always demanded that
the audience stretch their corners
all the way out to meet ours.
But what if, Frank...
What if we pull our corners back
a little bit?
Just a tiny tiny bit
and then everyone's corners can
meet in a place that's still
a really long way off.
But it's just a bit less...
You know?
And a bit more likeable.
- But not in a bad way.
- I'm not playing the fucking ukulele.
Frank...
I'm writing my most
likeable song ever.
I've always dreamed that one day
I'd have a band member
who shared my vision
of creating
extremely likeable music.
So thank you, Jon.
You gave me the
little push I needed.
- Yeah.
- Okay, enough chatter.
Here it is!
Ever.
Coca-Cola,
lipstick, Ringo
Dance all night,
dance all night
I've got dancing legs, whoo
I've got dancing legs
They won't stop me dancing,
no, they won't stop me dancing
Kiss me, just kiss me
Kiss me, Nefertiti
Just the way you like it
Just the way you like it,
kiss me, kiss me
Lipstick kiss me,
lipstick Ringo
That's the way
you like it!
Uh...
This is your most
likeable song ever?
Yeah!
- People will love it.
- Actually...
Actually, Frank,
I think that we could
push the likeability
even further.
You're shitting me.
How?
Can I just...
Um, where did you start?
But what if... I don't know,
we regulate it a bit more?
I love it!
- Yeah? And then maybe, you know, um...
- I love it.
If we played an "F" down here,
that would be good, wouldn't it?
You should be famous!
That's so likeable!
Jon fixed it!
I'm officially here.
Check me.
Hello.
Sorry.
Thanks.
- We're igniting the light and letting it shine.
We're igniting the light
and letting it shine.
- We're igniting the light and letting it...
- Hi.
Hey hi, can I get
a quick word with you?
We were in the forest
like secret squirrels.
Now we're likeable.
We're... we're so...
It's gonna be huge.
Jon fixed everything.
- You gotta come see us tomorrow night.
- Great!
- I promise nothing bad'll happen to you.
- Thank you so much.
- Let's go take a walk.
- I'm incredibly happy to be here.
- I'm fine, I'm relaxed!
- Great.
You know, forgive me
for my problems formerly.
The people were liking it.
The weight.
I'm fine, I'm fine.
I'm totally relaxed.
I'm... I'm fine,
I'm perfectly fine.
Frank's not okay. What
are you talking about?
I need your help
to get him out of here.
He said he's perfectly fine,
- relaxed.
- I need your help to get him out of here.
He looks happy to me.
-
- I seem what?
...not in control.
Frank?
Frank?
Have you seen a man
wearing a fake head?
No?
Sorry, have you seen a man
wearing a fake head?
- Yeah, a great big head?
- Yeah.
Yeah, he and a lady
went around the corner.
Frank, Frank!
Frank!
Frank? Oh, can you
feel my breath?
Frank.
What the fuck are you doing?
Breathe, breathe.
It's okay, it's okay.
Do you want to come back
to the hotel, Frank?
It's warm there.
Don't listen to her.
She's the one who's nuts.
Not you. Tomorrow
night is everything
we've worked for.
They're ready to love us.
They're ready
to love you, Frank.
Don't throw that away.
Frank, stay with me.
Oh, thank God.
I'm sorry.
You a little sad?
Yes, Jon, I'm a little bit sad.
Oh no!
- Chinchilla.
- Chinchil... ow!
- Fuck!
-
- Oh, she stabbed me in the fucking leg!
- Frank!
- Get off me. Frank!
- Hey, put the knife down.
- Who the fuck are you?
-
was arrested today
and charged with assault
and sincerely hope
our own crazy diamond
He's dead?!
Asleep.
No no, he's...
He's just tired.
He'll be all right for tonight.
Not Frank, you.
Sorry?
I've known this since
the first time I saw him
on that beach.
He would have drowned Lucas
to take his place in the band.
- No, I wouldn't have.
- 'Cause when he looks inside himself,
- Yes, I can!
-
is to live off of your
talent like a tick.
- Sorry?
- Which is why he had to get rid of Clara.
Clara chose to stab me.
We're not playing without Clara.
What are you talking about? We've
got the biggest gig of our lives
coming up in three hours. The stabbing
could not have come at a better time.
Frank, I've had everyone at South
by southwest on the phone.
Baraque and I have packed our things.
We're leaving.
No, you can't leave.
We've had 767,328 hits.
Frank, say something.
- 767,918! They're all watching.
- Frank?
So many people.
See?
So many people.
Don't f... oh!
Good luck playing
tonight without a band.
I've got one word for you:
Unplugged!
Me on guitar, you on vocals.
Delegates really like it when bands
go unplugged... special thing.
- How's your leg?
- Oh, it'll be okay.
We set everything up
like you guys asked.
- Are you sure you want to go ahead?
- Oh, absolutely.
Igniting the light
and letting it shine.
Frank, are you okay?
Uh-huh! Ooh, if I was you
guys, I'd be so nervous.
Oh, it goes with the territory.
Yeah, but I mean playing
without your band
after what just happened?
Well, it's not like we don't
know the songs or anything.
With that many people,
I would be shitting myself.
- Would you please shut your mouth?
-
Igniting the light
and letting it shine.
- Where are you going?
- To do my ablutions.
That's not the toilet.
Just... be as quick
as you can.
- 30 seconds!
- Frank.
Let's fuck.
Just wait here
for a few seconds, okay?
Mm-hmm.
Hey!
Hey, don't... fuck.
Wait out here.
Whoo!
Hello.
Prepare for rapture!
Whoo!
Whoo yeah!
Hello, South by southwest!
Whoo!
It's been a crazy 24 hours,
but we're still here
and we're still the Soronprfbs!
Unplugged.
Chinchilla!
- Yeah!
- Okay, here's a little song I wrote.
I hope you like it.
This is the best day of my life.
LA LA LA-LA LA
LA LA LA-LA LA...
Come on, Frank.
LA LA LA-LA LA...
Fuck.
Fuck. Frank!
Frank, Frank!
What is it, Frank?
Frank, come on!
- What is it?
- M-music's shit.
The music is shit.
...demonstrate how
this mop with its revolu...
...biotech people
making money...
...Cleveland, Ohio band,
the gentile youth,
had all of Austin
talking last night
as they played a barnstorming
set at South by southwest.
Aren't we supposed to be
playing at South by southwest?
Frank.
I know you weren't happy
with the music...
So let's work on it together.
Why not?
You're not Clara.
The motel owner says if we haven't
paid in full by the end of the week,
Fuck's sake!
Oh, excuse me for a second.
- Fuck.
- It's all right.
It's all right.
Here.
- Here.
- Just leave it.
Oh, you stink!
I made it.
Now will you use it?!
Take it off.
The head.
I mean...
In cognitive
behavioral therapy they say
face your fears.
They say take the head off.
So let's do it.
- Let's take the fucking head off.
- I have a certificate!
I know you have a certificate.
I know you've got
a motherfucking certificate!
Just take it off!
Take it off!
Fucking hell.
Oh no, it's all right!
Frank! Oh.
Come back!
Oh!
Where did he go?
That way.
- Was he injured?
- He was limping.
Did you see his face?
Yeah hello, you want
to report a missing person?
- Yes.
-
- Frank.
-
Just Frank.
-
- Somewhere between...
And what does
this person look like?
Driving me crazy,
but I know who you are.
- Hmm?
- You're the chinchilla guy, right?
- Mm-hmm.
-
And then, what, there's the
dude with the big head
and the crazy chick...
Uh... Clara, right?
Dude, you guys are
like total myths.
I mean there's fucking footage
of you everywhere online.
...chinchilla guy!
- Chinchilla guy.
- Oi, chinchilla guy!
See? I mean, all the footage...
You're all totally erratic and shit,
nervous breakdowns,
"chinchilla!"
People rolling around
on the floor.
And now it's all like,
"what happened to Frank?"
It's like he just vanished.
I mean...
- Fucking hilarious.
- I don't think it's hilarious.
I thought it was supposed
to be hilarious.
- It's...
-
Total freaks.
old smokey
All covered
With snow
I lost my poor lover
By courting
Too slow.
Uh, I saw...
Everything you said
was true, Nana.
I ruined everything.
I'm sorry.
So sorry.
Frank ran away.
I don't know if...
I was hoping you might
know where he is.
Ain't nobody here
wears no fake head.
Okay.
Bluff, Kansas.
Hi.
Frank?
Frank, I'm so ashamed.
I should never have tried
to pull your head off.
- I don't know...
- I'm the tree surgeon.
I'm just... I'm just here
to look at the tree.
I've been very worried
about you.
I just wanted to find you to...
Make sure you're okay.
How are things without the head?
lovely skin.
The head was my fault.
I made him his first one.
He was 14.
I did it even though I knew
there wasn't any costume party.
It turns out the worst thing
to do with something like that
is to pander to it.
Who knew?
Something must have happened
to him to make him like that.
Nothing happened to him.
He's got a mental illness.
The torment he went through
to make the great music.
The torment didn't
make the music.
He was always musical. If
anything, it slowed him down.
It was a good home.
It's just like my home.
I have to go now, Frank.
You all right?
Yeah.
I know I ruined everything.
I'm sorry.
It's good you're still playing.
I try, but...
It doesn't come out good.
I want to marry
A lighthouse keeper
And keep him
Company
I want to marry
A lighthouse keeper
And live
we'll have parties
On a moonlit isle
And clam-bakes
On a coral reef
and seagulls
By the score
I wanna marry
A lighthouse keeper
I'll Polish his lamps
By the light of the day
a lighthouse keeper...
It's really nice...
Nice to see you.
It's nice to be here.
El Madrid.
I love your wall.
Put your arms around me.
Fiddly digits.
Itchy britches.
Stale beer
Fat fucked, smoked out
Cowpoked
Sequined Mountain ladies
I love your wall
I love you all
I...
Love
You all
Washrooms smell,
they could be cleaner
Stench of cigarettes
and stale urea
I love you all
Prodigal son wants to return
To where the dogs play pool
I love you all
I love you all
I...
Love
You all...
I love you all
I love you all
I love you all
I...
Love
You all...
El Madrid,
it's nice to see you
washrooms smell,
they could be cleaner
stench of cigarettes
and stale urea
Lonely little carpet tuft,
a twisted woolly Joshua tree
surrounded by
its fallen friends
alone in threadbare
woven field
what age are you
in carpet years?
Is it spring and you're
the first to wake?
Or are you old
but still strong enough
to keep what winter
wants to take?
is it luck that
you're still standing
and you've not been
flattened, too?
Do you tremble
in the little wind
that's squeezed out
by my shoe?
has your tuftiness mutated so
your strands are made of steel?
you'll never bend
beneath the heel?
