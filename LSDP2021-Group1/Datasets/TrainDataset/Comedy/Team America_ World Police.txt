"Let me help you to go straight."
That night
"Get in line and wait your turn!"
"And quit your shovin'!"
"Well if it ain't me old cell-mate"
"Come quick ~~ burglars!"
"Get busy!"
"Please be quiet as my mother
is very ill"
"Let me help you to go straight."
"Please don't go up ~~ My mother
is very ill.
and the shock might kill her !"
"He is my housband."
