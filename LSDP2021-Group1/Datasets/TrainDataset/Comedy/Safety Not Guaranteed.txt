DARIUS: How far back
do you want me to go?
College?
Oh, I was totally outgoong.
A real people person.
In high school,
I felt Iike that mouse
that gets dropped
into the snake cage
and just kinda sits there,
frozen, trying to blend in.
I guess I remember being
happy when I was a kid.
Back when you
just naturally expect
good things to happen.
Before my mom died.
Now I just expect the worst
and try not to
get my hopes up.
Which is why I'm here.
Does that answer
the question?
Usually people just say
where they're from and
where they worked before.
Great.  I'm
already overqualified.
So, in your previous
experience,
the call of duty
for a customer?
No.
Oh, I get it.
You think you're
too good for this.
Why are you even here?
No, I'm sorry...
I really need the money.
I Iive at home,
I work my ass off
at this internship.
I just...
Yeah, it's not gonna
work out here.
I can tell your type.
You're just not
a quality hire.
Wazzup?
No, I don't want
the prepubescent Iook.
I want a woman.
We don't retouch
at Seattle Magazine.
We're journalists.
No, not there. An intern.
Yeah.
That's what I'm saying.
We respect women.
Don't put that there.
That goes in
the utility closet...
I know...
And then refresh
all the bathrooms.
I was just giving
you this change.
Yeah,
this is my job now.
It's Iike spelling
things out for interns.
Oh.
Fuck! Okay.
BRIDGET: Writers, ideas.
It's idea time again.
It's that time.
What have you got?
Does anybody have an idea?
Or a story?
Are you guys here?
Can you hear me? Anyone?
Top 10 dog parks in Seattle.
BRIDGET: No.
WOMAN: Summer activities
for winter people.
Not interested.
Jeff?
AII right. How about
this time travel ad?
What have you got?
JEFF: Yeah,
somebody e-mailed it in
from the classifieds.
He's Iooking
for somebody to go
back in time with him.
Do a Iittle
tongue-in-cheek
investigation.
Find this guy, see if
he thinks it's real
or if it's a prank.
BRIDGET: Not bad.
JEFF: The guy says,
"You'll get paid
when you get back.
"Bring your own weapons.
"Safety's not guaranteed."
And he's only done
this once before.
See if maybe he
believes in this stuff.
I don't know.
I think it could be funny.
You wanna do it?
AII right. You got it.
Can I get
a couple interns?
I'll do it.
Help me with the research?
Do some heavy Iifting...
Me, too,
please. Me.
AII right. Give me
the Iesbian and the Indian,
and I got a story.
We sent a Ietter to
the address in the ad
and asked them
to get back to us.
And I called
the Iocal paper,
but they're really
uptight about giving out
information on people
that take out ads, so...
I fucked Bridget.
DARIUS: Wow.
JEFF: Yeah.
You know, sometimes
somebody pisses you
off so much
that you just wanna
get in there with...
Did she Iike
criticize your technique
the whole time?
Like boss you around?
She did, right?
Maybe a Iittle.
AII right, we should go.
Let's go to Ocean View.
We can just find
whoever put up the ad
and stake him out.
We? What do you mean "we"?
I mean we, the three of us.
Now you don't wanna go?
That place sucks.
That place does not suck.
I had the best
summer of my Iife
in Ocean View.
I'm not going.
Yeah, you are.
No.
It seemed Iike
I was asking,
but I'm actually telling
as your boss.
You're coming.
DARIUS: Dad,
I'm going out of town
for a few days.
Out out?
No, it's just
this work thing.
Yeah, I think it'd be
great if you went out,
did a Iittle social stuff.
Get out of your funk.
I have no funk.
I'm totally funkless.
Going out and being
with your friends.
I think it's a great idea.
What's wrong with me?
Well, you're sad.
I don't know how
to describe it.
It's Iike there's
a cloud following you.
You're antisocial,
and you're a virgin.
What?
I don't ever see
you with any guys.
I don't remember
the Iast time you
brought a guy home.
Yeah, well, how do
you know I'm not
on Craigslist
having casual encounters?
Or when I was
away at the dorms?
You weren't there.
I talked to Amy.
Why are you talking
to my college roommate?
We're Facebook friends.
Oh, my God!
How do I eject?
Why do you have
flames on your Iaptop?
It's a gaming Iaptop.
It's really fast.
What time would
you go back to?
If you could?
I don't know.
I'm fine here.
I would definitely go back.
Everything cool is gone.
The Aztecs.
People killing themselves
for each other.
You wouldn't
wanna see the dragons
and the elves
fight each other in
the magical forest?
Come on!
No. That wasn't a time.
Yeah. Okay.
Yeah.
Get in, retards.
So, here's what
I'm thinking. We're
budgeted for two rooms,
but if we share a room,
we can use that extra money
for some other shit.
What, drugs?
JEFF: That's exactly right.
Easy, Arnau,
we're messing
with you, pal.
We're talking about using it
for buffets and shit.
You never done
coke or anything
when you're
studying for an exam?
Cocaine? Are you crazy?
What is it you study?
Biological
and Iife sciences.
Makes sense.
So what are you doing
interning at a magazine?
Diversity Iooks
good on an application
for grad school.
We got to get you Iaid
on this vacation.
That's what needs to happen.
Vacation?
AII right,
work trip, whatever.
Send her out
into the world
You know that
she's bound to get hurt
God softly moved
the young girl
When she was
digging in the dirt
You're hurt
So bring it back
It's freezing here.
It's got bite, don't it?
Reminds me of
going back to school.
Yes. It's all one
Iong school year now.
No start, no finish.
Except for this guy.
How many years till
you graduate, Arnau?
Total, including doctorate
or just undergraduate?
Ah, forget it.
How're we doing
the beds?
We'll do me in one,
interns on the other.
Okay.
No.
Cool. Me and Darius.
Fine. I hope
you moisturize, Arnau,
'cause I cuddle.
Tomorrow morning first thing,
we hit the post office.
Let's hope our boy checks
his P.O. Box every day.
There she is.
What?
"Wanted, someone to travel
back in time with me,
"this is not a joke.
"P.O. Box 91
Ocean View, Washington.
"You'll get paid
after we get back.
Must bring your own weapons.
"Safety not guaranteed."
Hey, here we go.
Mmm, no way.
He's too old to
be time traveling.
Come on. That's
the time traveling demo.
White beards,
spectacles, pipes.
Aww.
Close.
Wait, what about this one?
DARIUS: Yeah.
She wants to stop whoever
gave her that haircut
from being born.
Yo! Yo! It's him.
It's the guy.
ARNAU: Him? Are you sure?
Yeah, I'm sure.
Box 91. Get in.
Wait, what are you doing?
Following him.
What about Jeff?
You should call him!
KENNETH: That's
pretty amazing stuff, man.
I'll tell you about
the cat in the box theory,
it'll blow your mind.
It's Iike I'm the only
one who really gets it.
You know?
I started this dialog
with some big shot
theoretical physicist online,
and I'm Iike,
"Do the rules of quantum
"mechanics allow for
alternate histories?"
And he just blasted me.
You know, people are
just so convinced
it's a fixed thing,
but they're just,
Iike, Iooking at
this Iittle sliver of time,
that's all people can see.
It's not a fixed thing,
Shannon.
You know, it's on and on
in both directions.
It's Iike a "V,"
you know what I mean?
I gotta do
a bathroom check, brother.
Yeah, we're...
You know what I'm saying.
DARIUS: I'd Iike to
fill out a comment card
on one of your employees,
Kenneth.
What's his Iast name?
Sorry, ma'am,
he's a Iittle...
No, no,
it's a positive comment.
It's Iike complimenting him.
Oh. Oh, good.
Um, Kenneth Calloway.
Calloway.
Thanks.
JEFF: Hit the thing
that says I have
a new message.
"Liz confirmed you
on Facebook."
Here. No photos,
that's a drag.
Okay, good.
She still Iives here.
She Iives in this town.
Who is Liz McHollis?
She was a girl
I had a fling with
when my family used to
come here over the summers.
She was this really
smokin' hot blond.
She was my first blow job.
If there's one girl
that I still
think about, honestly.
Here she is. Look at you,
you went all rogue.
What did you get?
Got his name,
where he works.
Great.
What did you guys get?
She accepted, but no photo,
so I'm not really sure.
What?
He came here to hook up
with an old high
school girlfriend.
Seriously? That's
what you've been doing?
Well, I've been doing
other stuff too, but
maybe this will
change your attitude
a Iittle bit.
That's her when she was 18,
I used to see her naked.
So?
So I'm coming back
to try to see her naked again.
I'd be weirded out
if some guy tried
to track me down
after 20 years.
I'd be weirded out too
if some guy tried
to track you down.
DARIUS: Why?
JEFF: Who would do that?
Tomorrow morning,
I'll go in.
You know, go undercover,
pretend to answer his ad
and get the scoop
on this yo-yo.
This is definitely it.
What a piece of shit.
AII right,
I'm goin' in.
How do I Iook,
Arnau? Good.
Good.
Can I go in?
No, you did
good Iast night,
but I'm gonna handle this.
I don't wanna
overwhelm the guy.
AII right?
Wish me Iuck.
So, uh...
Do you go out
a Iot back home,
Iike clubs and stuff?
Not really.
You know those
really tight Ieggings
that girls wear,
do you ever wear those?
No.
I think you would
Iook nice in them.
Hello?
JEFF: Kenneth?
Kenneth?
Kenneth Calloway, right?
Is that right?
My name is Jeff.
Look, I saw your ad
in the classifieds.
I wanna know if
you need a partner.
What's your mission?
What do you mean
what's my mission?
What's your reason
for going back?
Well, who wouldn't want
to go back? It's
an amazing opportunity.
To go back in time,
you know?
See gladiators
and watch dinosaurs
with my own eyes.
Have sex with a pilgrim.
Fun stuff, that's all I want.
I wanna go back. It's neat.
Who wouldn't want
to go back, Kenneth?
You wanna go back.
Why do you wanna go back?
Well, do you need a partner?
Can you Iook fear
and danger in the eye?
That's an odd question.
Have you ever stared
fear and danger in the eye
and said, "Yes"?
Sure.
Get off my porch.
Let's start over.
Come on, we could be pals.
Let's go back in time.
Man, that smile...
What is that smile?
You don't know pain.
I don't know pain?
You don't know regret.
Yeah. AII right.
You don't know...
Okay.
Well, it was
really nice to meet you.
That's what I thought.
So, what'd he say?
Well, he's the real deal.
That ad is no prank.
He's not Iike retarded,
but there's something
wrong with this guy.
Definitely didn't
Iike my ass,
I'll tell you that.
So, what,
that's it?
Oh, no,
this just got good.
What makes you think
he won't slam
the door in my face, too?
'Cause you gotta be
sincere and charm him,
okay?
He's used to assholes
Iike me coming and
making fun of him.
Uh, also probably
none of the other people
were beautiful girls.
Easy, Arnau.
What?
But he's right.
Use that, too.
There's something off
about this guy, okay?
So you gotta go slow,
Iike you're trapping
a skittish animal.
You know, Iure him, play coy.
Girls know how to
do that shit.
You're dangling my vagina
out there Iike bait?
What if this guy's
a murderer?
What if he cuts me up into
Iittle pieces and eats me?
Then the story's even better.
Do you sell guns here?
What kind of guns?
I don't know.
Something sexy and affordable
with killing power.
You should try
C&R Guns in Wilkins.
The state of Washington
does not allow
the sale of firearms
in the business premises
of a grocer.
Hmm.
What about those thingies
with the spiky ball
at the end of
the chain things?
You know, with the...
Do you have those?
What exactly is
the intended use?
Is there a pest problem,
or hunting?
Well, if your ad had
been written properly,
I may have a better idea
of what I need.
My ad?
Yeah.
It's pretty sloppy.
Excuse me?
You heard me.
I hope you worked harder
on your calibrations.
My calibrations are
flippin' pinpoint, okay?
Mmm.
There are people after me.
How do I know you
don't work for them?
Because I've never worked
for anybody in my Iife.
You ever faced
certain death?
If it was so certain,
I wouldn't be here, would I?
This is a bad place to talk.
I get off in Iike 15.
Rendezvous?
See you in eight.
Ohh, get down!
What's going on?
Just get down!
Don't Iet him see you.
ARNAU: Wait, is he coming?
Yeah.
What the hell is he doing?
I don't know.
He's all freaked out.
He thinks people
are following him.
We're gonna rendezvous.
He's taking me to
a secure Iocation.
Get down!
JEFF: If this guy's
taking you to
some sex bunker,
he's gonna be freaked out
when me and Arnau
pull out of this thing
Iike it's a clown car.
Hey, what's going on
out there?
Shh. Get down!
Shit! He's coming!
Oh, man.
JEFF: Don't Iet him see me,
it'll blow everything for you.
What am I supposed to do?
I don't know! Do something!
We're being followed!
Go! Get in your car! Go!
What the hell is this?
Oh, shit!
Git! Git! Go! Get out!
What the fuck?
He's got a gun!
Just get out.
Where are we?
I don't know. Just get out.
I'll come get you
when I'm done. Come on!
I don't know.
Yeah. Fuck that.
Are you guys racist?
It's complicated.
Hello?
Hey. It's too hot here
right now. Can't talk.
Look, my gut tells me
you're not with them,
but I have to be
absolutely certain.
I'm gonna do a quick
background check on you.
If everything is good,
I'll be in touch, okay?
Yeah, okay.
AII right, over and...
Um, good night.
Hi, is Liz around?
LIZ: And it's
not necessarily...
It's not a false
relationship, but
she's so charismatic.
She's such a beam of Iight.
AII the reporters
are saying that. Also,
what I'm reading from...
I don't know.
She was big, and Iike...
Mmm, and Iike your age?
Yeah. Gross.
It was more Iike...
I don't know, Iike
the years have not been
kind to her, you know?
They pretty much took a shit
all over her face.
So, did your dude call yet?
No.
ARNAU: Maybe we should
do a background
check on this guy,
you know, make sure
he's not a psychopath.
He seems pretty harmless.
JEFF: Don't worry, Darius,
he'll call.
I'm sure your
weird mojo clicked with
his weird mojo and
you got it in the bag.
C'mon!
Ready, hike!
Hi.
Thanks.
Listen, I'm sorry
about the noise Ievel here.
But we need to
maintain cover.
I'm certain
I'm being recorded,
I'm certain
I'm being followed.
So, who are
we dealing with here?
I'm not sure yet.
Government agents maybe.
Probably.
But the joke's on them.
The technology I've invented
can't be understood
by the average mind.
So, what are the, um...
Means of transportation?
Just hold it in your holster
for a second, okay?
I'm still making
up my mind about you
as a potential partner.
I have to be
absolutely certain
that I can trust you
before I include you
in certain information.
Well, I just don't
wanna be jerked around.
You know, jerking around
is for jerks.
God, I remember this smell.
The smell of grass.
I used to play
a Iittle bit,
back in the day.
I think you should
give Liz another chance.
Oh, you do?
That sucks to
spend all that time
thinking about her,
and you're finally here
and you don't
follow through with it.
I think it's sad that
you're a 22-year-old virgin
with those creepy glasses,
but I don't bring it up.
You know what?
Actually, Arnau,
there are Iots of
hot chicks here, man.
You could kill in
a place Iike this.
You should run game.
Arnau, Arnau, Arnau,
be cool, run game.
Shh.
She's in, Iike,
high school.
I know!
I know she's
in high school
and you're in college.
Who do you think
that girl wants
to fuck? You!
Could you, please!
What?
So what's the year?
Where are we going?
work for you?
It's perfect.
I will need to know
the timetable, though.
There's a critical step soon.
I need to obtain
certain materials
to facilitate the travel.
I plan to execute this step
within the next week.
Why 2001? What are
you going back for?
Like I said,
certain information
will have to wait.
Knock him on his ass,
he's a bum!
Right there,
these two.
AII right. Let's go.
Why? Sit down.
We're not going anywhere.
Tell me why. Why?
You're drinking alcohol
at a high school game.
You're damn right I am.
United States of America.
Drinking a beer
at a football game.
Don't get tough
on me, big guy.
Let's not do this.
KENNETH: Wait a minute,
I know him. He came
to my house.
Um, I think that guy
is recording
our conversation.
Is there
somewhere else we can go?
Let's get out of here.
Come on.
Stay close. Yeah.
Are you okay?
I really would have
messed that guy up
if I wasn't trying to
keep such a Iow profile.
I'm glad I got to see
your qualities, though.
I think you're ready
for the next step,
some basic training.
The heat's moving in.
That's all for tonight.
I'm Ieaving.
I'm walking out!
I'm Ieaving by choice.
By choice.
Seriously?
This place is a dump.
Let's get out of here.
Fuck.
Pretty good. You might
be a one arm shooter.
Okay, I'll try it.
Let's just Ioosen it up.
You ready?
Yeah.
Yeah! You smoked him!
I smoked him.
Come on!
I think I'm
getting better than you.
Hey, Iet's not get ahead
of yourself here, okay?
It's one thing to
hit a target
that's standing still,
but think about it
when the heat's moving in.
Smoke it!
I wanna build you up
Brick by brick
I wanna break you down
Brick by brick
I'm gonna reconstruct
Double smoke!
Brick by brick
Ahh
Brick by brick
Ahh
How are your
hamstrings holding up?
Real good.
You're pretty impressive
with a handgun.
It's a superlative performance
under simulated pressure.
Our chemistry is
starting to build.
I really Iike your intensity.
You're, Iike, no-nonsense.
There's no sense
in nonsense. Especially
when the heat's hot.
Exactly.
I Iike your intensity, too.
Yeah?
Yeah. You've got good moves.
Nobody's seen
my moves before.
Haven't brought
a candidate this far into
the training process.
Really?
We'll be Iearning
from each other from now on.
Good.
We still have to
discuss your reason
for going back.
That's classified
information.
I can appreciate that,
I respect that,
but I have
a certain responsibility
to keep as the Ieader
of this mission.
Then I have to tell you
that it's personal.
Darius, sometimes
I think we are progressing
in this mission,
and then other times,
I'm not so sure.
I'm going back to
stop my mother from dying
when I was 14.
How'd she die?
She was killed by some guy.
Just some guy
at a gas station
took her and killed her.
Oh, man.
Just some random thing?
Yeah.
Well, no, actually.
She was driving home.
It was really Iate,
and she called me to tell me
she was coming home, and I...
I asked her to stop
and get me chocolate milk.
Because I had to
have chocolate milk.
So Iike five minutes Iater,
she called me
to tell me that she
got the chocolate milk
and she was coming home.
And her voice was Iike,
really excited,
Iike she was really happy.
And I was,
Iike, okay, whatever.
I wasn't even nice.
That was the Iast time
I talked to her.
That's not your fault.
Yeah. That's
what they tell me.
AII right, Darius.
I think you're ready.
I trust you.
Good.
You should.
Jeff! Hey!
Hey. Liz,
it's great to see you.
Look at you.
Look at you.
So, this is where you Iive.
This is my house.
Well, Iook, I wanna say
I'm sorry about yesterday.
I was gonna come,
but work's
getting crazy and...
I was sad 'cause you
got me thinking about you
on that Facebook.
I never thought
I'd see you again.
Oh, God, excuse me.
Would you come in?
I'd Iove to.
Your hair's red.
Yeah.
It's different.
Yeah. I changed it.
It's just about the only
thing I've changed.
Really?
Yeah.
Kind of. What about you?
A Iot has changed.
Almost, Iike, everything.
Tell me.
The car... I got an Escalade.
And my job's going really
well. Got a great condo.
Tell me about your Iife.
I just did.
I've got to read
this magazine of yours.
Oh, don't.
That is so exciting.
It's not that exciting.
You know what?
I always thought
you'd do something
special with your Iife.
If you knew what
it was really Iike,
you wouldn't say
it was special.
Oh, come on. What...
What's wrong with your neck?
Sorry I'm doing that.
It's just I got
this shooting pain.
I have to share a bed
with a male intern.
And I don't feel Iike
rubbing asses with him, so...
Let me see.
You don't have to do that.
Oh.
Ooh.
You need to put
some heat on that.
I do?
Oh, I have pies in the oven.
You make pies?
I made some pies.
I made, uh, peach, apple,
strawberry rhubarb.
Which one do you want?
Yeah.
LIZ: Mmm.
Liz, that is unbelievable.
You bake pies,
you give these massages,
and you're not married?
I don't get it.
I was married.
He was a ball player.
And I was the good
Iittle wife, baking
cookies for the team.
Oh, my God,
you bake cookies, too?
Cameron got traded,
and when he went
up to the Marlins,
he started making money
and started messing around
with those Miami girls.
Well, I can
say this honestly,
Cameron's an idiot.
Yeah, well, we were young.
Hey, do you have
one free night while
you're in town?
Because I would
Iike to make you
a homemade dinner.
I wanna eat that
homemade dinner.
DARIUS: I'm just gonna
press "record." Okay.
So, Kenneth, why are you
looking for a partner?
I feel Iike
the world is mostly
full ofjankholes,
but I believe that
there are purists out there,
and that's why I put
that ad in the paper.
It's my hope that
if you're watching
this video,
something incredible
has happened.
I do believe that martial arts
are for self-defense only.
While I would Iike
to maneuver through
this world with
an open heart and mind,
sometimes that
doesn't gain you favor.
So I just need to be
equipped with
the necessary skill sets,
guns, training,
weapons, fighting,
in case I encounter
any obstacles that
need to be defeated.
The area is clear.
DARIUS: Oh, my God!
Mission accomplished.
Wow! Man,
that was intense.
Task completed.
KENNETH: The mission
has to do with regret
and the mission has
to do with mistakes.
The mission's
also about Iove.
I'm already saying too much.
Aren't you interested
in some of this
equipment or something?
Can we talk
about something else?
So it's very important
that you and I do not
abuse the power
that will come
with our knowledge
of the future.
No matter how tempting
it will be to
gain personal fortune
or notoriety by say,
being the first
person to Iist
the Contra code for up, up,
down, down, Ieft-right,
Ieft-right, B-A-start.
Or to say,
"Hey, Ieave your Star Wars
figurines in the box
"'cause they'll be
worth Iike hundreds more
if they are super pristine."
But what about if it's,
Iike, for the betterment
of future society?
Absolutely not.
We have to stick to the plan.
So when do you fill
me in on the plan?
Pretty soon.
The action's getting hungry.
Ugh.
I can't eat here.
KENNETH: Why?
See that kid?
He's Iike a mutant kid.
Hey, there's
something on your ear.
Um...
It's fine, it does...
Are you okay?
It Iooks Iike it's
falling off or something.
No, no, no. It's fine.
Don't worry about it.
Shit! Sorry. It's off.
DARIUS: Kenneth!
The mission's off,
I'm sorry.
Forget it.
You're not the right one.
Hey, what's wrong?
It's fake.
What's fake?
My flipping ear is fake.
They used to make fun of me,
all the other kids.
My parents could only
afford one prosthetic,
so I had to wait
until I was fully-grown.
You know that's not
a big deal, right?
Yes, it is!
No, it isn't.
People used to
make fun of me, too.
Yeah, right.
I shave my arms and
wax my upper Iip, okay?
You're saying that to
make me feel better.
I'm serious.
I had a freaking mustache
until I was 14.
Okay, we can still do this,
but you have to promise me
we're never,
ever gonna talk about
my ear ever again
for as Iong as you
and I both shall Iive.
Okay. Okay.
Forever.
But can I say something?
What?
I think it's kinda cool.
Get in.
Okay.
So then, what did you
tell him your reason
for going back to 2001 is?
I just made up some story.
Yeah? What's the story?
I told him that
I was gonna go back
and stop my parents
from getting divorced.
Arnau, you son of
a bitch. Smash him!
What are you doing?
Whatever I'm doing,
I'm feeling
fan-fucking-tastic doing it.
Ew, did you just
have sex with that girl
you came here to stalk?
No, I didn't, actually.
We shared
a nice conversation.
And you know the truth is,
she's not that fat.
I don't know, a girl's beauty,
it's in the eyes, you know?
And that doesn't
go away with age.
Wow.
ARNAU: So, anyway,
can we please just
focus on the article
and figure out what's
wrong with this guy,
Iike Iow I.Q.,
or emotional disorder,
or whatever it is?
What makes you think
there's something
wrong with him?
'Cause he thinks
he can go back in time.
Was there something
wrong with Einstein
or David Bowie?
Not the same.
Just because the guy's
trying to do something new
doesn't mean
he's a freak show.
So you think this is normal?
I don't know. Is it
normal that your interns
do all your work for you?
Is that normal?
Right.
Is that how all your
articles get written?
It's him. I have to go.
KENNETH: Okay, this is it.
There's technology
inside this building
that I need to
complete the machine
that will take us
on our journey.
I'm gonna breach
the outer perimeter,
gonna disable
their security measures,
penetrate the target,
Iocate and secure
the package,
then we'll rendezvous
at the getaway point.
You got it?
Rendezvous at
the getaway point.
I've been watching
this place for weeks.
Yeah, got it.
The security's full
of holes. We'll be fine.
Okay.
Fuck!
Stay focused.
What am I doing?
Why am I doing this?
What am I doing?
Why am I doing this?
Let me see those keys.
Shit!
Okay.
KENNETH: Come on!
MAN: Excuse me?
Hey! Hey!
What is that?
What are those?
Lasers.
Lasers?
Those are real Iasers?
KENNETH: The mission's
been compromised.
MAN: Hey.
Where are you going?
Let's get out
of here! Drive!
KENNETH: Floor it!
Sorry.
What do
we do with the van?
Leave it.
I stole it from the Iot.
Hey, you didn't
hurt anyone, did you?
Like, you didn't...
No, no, no, no.
Look, it's a fake.
No casualties.
Here. Take it.
Ahh! Ahh! Okay.
You okay?
Yeah.
Take this.
It'll make you feel better.
You're shaking.
It's just adrenaline
from the infiltration.
It's good.
You ready? Come on,
Iet's go. Come on.
Yeah. Yeah.
Go. Go.
KENNETH: We gotta
stick to the back roads,
we can't be seen out here.
DARIUS: Oh, my God! Okay.
Damn it!
We're getting off the road.
Why?
Those are
government employees.
They'll blow our cover.
We gotta wait it out.
Kenneth, it's fine.
They won't tell.
No. We can't have
any witnesses
that will connect
my car to the van.
The people that are after me
are gonna be on full alert.
They'll put
the pieces together.
Totally unprofessional!
It's okay.
It's just...
It's a girl.
My reason for
going back is a girl.
Who was she?
She's my first girlfriend.
Her birthday was
the exact same day
in April as
mine is in October.
We ended up working
at the same restaurant.
She was just so nice to me.
She would make me
special food
and after work,
while all her friends
were getting ready to go out,
she would just hang out
and talk with me.
She was really pretty.
What happened to her?
She died.
Some jerk,
some a-hole jerk
in a band got drunk
and crashed his car
into her Iiving room.
I should have
been there, you know.
People tell you that
there are other girls
out there, you know, and
it's not just about a girl,
it's about...
It's about a time
and a place.
Do you have a favorite song?
Would you tell me
what it is?
It's stupid.
What is it?
Over the Rainbow.
It's a really
beautiful song.
It's that time and
that place and that song,
and you remember
what it was Iike
when you're in that place,
and then you
Iisten to that song,
and you know
you're not in that place
anymore and it
makes you feel hollow.
Mmm-hmm.
Can't just go find
that stuff again.
I Iike your reason
for going back.
It's really nice.
Thanks.
Fucking Iasers?
What kind of Iasers?
I don't know, I'm not
a frickin' Stormtrooper.
JEFF: This guy's awesome.
He's over there right now
thinking he's building
a frickin' time machine.
Hey, Arnau,
what are the chances
he can do that
with these Iasers?
How would I know, I'm not a...
He doesn't know.
He's not a frickin'
Stormtrooper either.
Stormtroopers don't
know anything about
Iasers or time travel,
they're blue-collar workers.
I gotta see this shit.
Isn't this Iike
violating his privacy?
Don't worry about it.
JEFF: I can't see much.
Looks Iike an engine.
What are you building
in there, Kenny?
JEFF: Who's this asshole?
DARIUS: Oh, my God,
there are people
following him.
There are really
people following him.
We're doing this.
Stay back. Don't spook him.
Stay back.
Don't scare them.
This is fucking intense.
We're going
fifteen miles an hour.
Shit. He saw us.
Oh, shit,
they're onto us.
Onto what?
Shit.
Don't Iet him
see you! Duck!
Stay down!
What the hell,
did you see those guys?
They Iook Iike
government agents
or something.
He's really being followed.
Holy shit!
Is this guy for real?
Kenneth? Are you okay?
KENNETH: I can't talk
right now, okay?
Just watch your back.
Okay.
Stay Iow and Iay Iow.
Yeah.
Go to the beach,
I'll pick you up.
It's almost time, Darius.
DARIUS: This is
totally crazy.
Who do you think
those guys are?
I have no idea.
Maybe he's not
totally insane,
maybe he really thinks
he's doing something and...
I don't know.
What? Why are you
Iooking at me Iike that?
I don't know.
You got a thing for this guy?
What?
No! I'm talk...
You saw those guys.
Can I ask you a question?
Do you mind, as a reporter?
What?
What is it that
you two weirdos do
when you're off alone?
I'm getting information.
What are you doing
when you're off alone?
I'm seeing an old friend.
Just take me to the beach.
I have to meet him.
AII right, this is it.
It's pretty obvious
they see
a threat in me possessing
this kind of power.
It's not clear yet what
entity they represent.
Their presence here
definitely accelerates
the plan, though.
They're gonna
have one of their
guys at every door,
but you should be okay.
I don't think
they've ID'ed you yet.
Got it.
Good Iuck.
Wait!
Go! Go!
Shannon?
I'm supposed to
give this to you.
This is from Kenneth.
Kenneth said to
give this to me?
My wife, she's...
You tell him...
Tell him I hope he gets
wherever he's goin'
and it all works out
Iike he wants.
I'll tell him.
AII good?
Yeah.
What?
Nothing.
Yeah, we're getting
some really
great stuff, Bridget,
I'm gonna need
a couple more days.
Bridget, I'm doing
an interview right now.
Yeah, I'll send you
an e-mail with
all the information,
and I'll paint
you a real picture.
Okay. I have to
go right now.
Wow.
That all seems so dangerous.
Her running around
with this guy...
Oh, she'll be fine.
You got any more
of that Ieftover pie?
That was pretty good.
I was thinking about you
and the time
we spent together.
I was pretty ripped
back then. Top of
my game back then.
You were not ripped.
Yes, I was.
Why don't you feel me now?
You Iook great.
KENNETH: Are you familiar
with cryptography?
Yeah. Of course.
Yeah. Well, I prefer
the St. Goodnight
code and cipher
for sending messages
that can't be compromised.
It's just 4-4-3-1 -4 and
then you just reverse
the whole thing, okay?
Yeah. Got it.
Learn it.
Practice it.
Hey!
If I show you something,
will you promise
not to tell anybody
else about it, ever?
Yeah.
When we go back in time,
if anything bad happens,
if somebody gets hurt,
or if you mess up,
or if the guys
who are after me
find me and catch me,
put a note inside this tin.
I'm gonna do the same thing.
If anything goes wrong,
we go back and we fix it.
Okay.
So far so good.
So that's been
there since 2001?
Since I was a kid.
I used to come up here
and camp with the Boy Scouts
near here when I was Iittle.
Do you know
what Star Wars is?
Yes.
Yeah.
So, when I was younger,
I used to bring my
Star Wars figures up here,
'cause I didn't
wanna Ieave 'em
back at the house
'cause they'd get Ionely.
And some of
the more cynical kids
would make fun of me,
they would throw them
in the fire and stuff...
Really?
This was before my
martial arts training,
of course.
But I found
this hiding spot
and sneak out here
at night,
and put 'em in the tin,
take them out,
then put them back
in the morning and...
Anyway...
I wish I could see you
when you were a Iittle kid.
I was not as impressive
as I am now,
I can assure you.
What?
Yeah.
Okay.
Wanna see something cool?
Yeah.
Come on.
That was the best sex
I've ever had.
And I've had a Iot of sex.
That's what you said
about the roast chicken.
That was the best
roast chicken I ever had.
You don't know
how Iong I've
thought about this.
You've become this,
Iike, character
in my head that's Iike,
it feels Iike
you're from a fairy tale,
and you're Iike this purity
that's just not in my Iife.
Aww.
You are so cute.
Hey.
This is gonna sound crazy.
I want you to come
to Seattle with me.
What?
Yeah.
It's crazy,
but I want you to come...
Jeff, the minute you
drive out of this place,
you are not going to
want to be with me.
That's just not true.
That's what I'm saying,
I mean, do you not feel this?
You're not in your
right mind right now.
I'm absolutely
in my right mind.
This is the clearest
I've been in a Iong time.
I've done this before.
You haven't done it with me.
No, I've done this
before and I'm too old.
We're the same damn age.
Oh.
That's perfect.
That's unbelievable.
Unbelievable. Okay.
Great. This is good.
This is perfect.
I'm glad you said that
'cause this was a mistake.
You're right.
You know what?
I open up my heart
to you and...
Thank you,
because my head
was turned around...
Jeff...
But it ain't anymore.
I think you're being
a Iittle crazy about this.
Yeah. I think you're
crazy for saying no.
Please go.
I'm goin' by choice.
Why are you sitting here?
Why would you be
sitting on your computer?
You are a young man.
You got the whole
world ahead of you.
I'm asking you to
be a man and try.
Are you ready to have
a crazy night with me?
'Cause I'm ready.
Say you're ready.
Say you're ready.
I'm ready.
My man. Good answer.
Let's do something stupid!
Stay here.
You guys ever
partied in an Escalade?
Here we go.
Here we go.
Drink. Drink.
You drink. Open that
up and start drinking,
I didn't buy it for nothing.
Good girl.
Go. Go.
Drink, drink, drink.
Arnau!
This guy's
getting Iaid tonight.
He's my best friend!
Arnau! Pay
the son of a bitch!
You warm enough?
Mmm-hmm.
This is all your stuff?
Well, I just kind
of set up here,
the Boy Scouts don't
really come up here
after September, so
it's kind of Iike
having a second home,
come to spend some nights
and clear the head.
Okay. This is for you.
I circled the Iocation
on the map,
this way you'll always
know where to find
the truck and this campsite.
Don't get Iost.
Okay.
What's that?
Is that a guitar?
No, it's called a zither.
Can you play this?
Not very well at all.
My dad had one,
he was really good.
Belinda really
Iiked music, so...
I always wished I could have
played her something,
so I've been writing her
this song for when
I see her again.
Will you play it?
It's...
Please?
No, it's not finished
and it's really just
not very good, so...
Well, I'll tell you
if it's good or not.
Okay.
It's only halfway done,
so it's just Iike...
Stand straight
Fall back in Iine
Comb your hair
Get to work on time
Everyone in the big machine
Tries to break your heart
And pull you underneath
Maybe I'm wrong
And all that you get
is what you see
Maybe I'm right
And there's something
out there to believe
Everybody's
talking in their sleep
They push
a Iot of air around
But don't say
much of anything
Except when
they laugh at me
Like ghosts under a sheet
Everybody's
talking in their sleep
I messed up a bunch of parts,
but that's basically
what it is.
No, it's so good.
Shut up.
So good.
Thanks.
Yeah.
Yeah. Anyway, you cold?
Ew...
Trust me. Trust me.
Now, feel this.
It works, right?
What are you
doing in the Iobby?
Are they still in there?
Yeah, that's the point.
She's still in there.
You go.
What do you mean I go?
I didn't want to hang
out with these three.
I did it for you!
I don't think so.
It's fine. You go.
Are you gay?
What? No...
Is that what this is?
No.
I'm asking you seriously,
I'm not judging you.
You don't know this about me,
but I don't care
about that stuff.
No, Jeff, I'm not gay, no.
This is set up perfectly.
Do you not think she's hot?
You're acting
Iike it's so easy.
Because it is so easy.
No, Jeff. It's easy
for you, not for me.
Why not?
Because I'm not you, Jeff.
Do you just wanna
see me get embarrassed?
No!
Arnau, come here, man.
Come here.
Fucking come here.
I'm not pranking you, man.
You're not gonna
get this opportunity
very much Ionger.
You're not always
gonna be 21, young man.
I promise you fucking that.
I don't know.
I don't know what to...
How do I start?
First of all, take
these pedophile glasses off
and don't wear these,
they make you Iook
Iike a weirdo, man.
I'm gonna put these on you.
Holy shit!
Look at that killer.
That dude right there
crushes chicks.
I would take a photo
of you and show you how
good you Iooked right now,
'cause you Iook fantastic.
You Iook Iike a damn pilot.
Okay.
Like a cool pilot
who drives jets.
Pop this shit. Uh-oh!
Boom, boom, boom.
Act Iike you've
been there before.
You're not gonna
be your age forever.
One day, you're
gonna be the old dirtbag.
AII by yourself.
This is the moment
you Iive for.
Okay.
Okay?
Okay.
Hey, Halloween,
you smoke?
Yeah.
Jeff, what the fuck?
It's so early, Bridget.
Yeah, I'm working here.
Isn't that what
you're doing down there?
Yes. That's what I'm doing.
I've been going over
the notes that
you've been sending in.
This Belinda St. Sing,
the ex-girlfriend he said
died in an accident.
Is that her name?
Yeah, that's right.
Why?
You're past curfew.
Were those girls with you?
Mmm.
Hey, you know that
girl your boyfriend
was going back in time
to save, Belinda?
Yeah?
Well, she's alive and well.
Lives about an hour away.
Uh...
How? What do you mean?
Bridget called and
set up an interview.
I think
your Iittle boyfriend
is seriously nuts.
Yeah, I know,
he's totally nuts.
He's completely crazy.
I know.
So she's alive. Okay.
I wanna do the interview.
That's fine.
You sure
you got this, kiddo?
Yeah?
Darius?
Hi.
Hi. Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
Come on in.
I've never been interviewed
by a magazine before.
He worked at Anderson's,
which was
the restaurant I waited at
all throughout college,
and he was really nice.
Different just than
the typical guys, I guess.
So how Iong were
you guys together?
Uh...
Well, we were never
really together, together.
You never dated?
I mean, I wouldn't call
it dating. He was, um...
He was one of
those guys, who
you kind of know
has a crush on you,
but he's really nice
and so you're
really nice back.
But he wasn't the type of guy
who you could easily, um,
fit into your Iife,
you know, with your
friends and everything.
He was
weird, I guess we've all
had one of those guys, right?
Yeah. Yeah,
I know what you mean.
So, then what happened?
Do you guys still talk?
After that,
I started dating Rob,
who was my Iast boyfriend
before I met my husband,
and then Kenneth
quit the restaurant.
I didn't see him for
a while after that.
Then there was the accident.
Accident?
Kenneth ran his car
into my boyfriend's house.
There was a big dent
under the kitchen window.
My God!
So I convinced Rob
to just Iet him go
and we...
We told the police
it was a hit and run.
I haven't seen him
since then.
But you said
you've seen him recently.
How is he?
He's good.
Excuse me.
Darius?
Can we have
a moment of your time?
Nothing to be
alarmed about.
We'd just Iike to
ask a few questions
about Kenneth Calloway.
Whoa. Guys?
We're from
Seattle Magazine.
We're just here doing
a story on this guy.
We're not involved
with what he's
involved with.
What do you want with him?
SMITH: He's been contacting
government scientists
on the Internet,
asking questions
about our particle
accelerator in Berkeley.
We've been
investigating Calloway
for a couple of years now
and we suspect him
of being an agent.
He can't be a spy.
He was arrested
in Colorado for
breaking into
a nuclear physics
Iaboratory.
And then there was
the recent robbery
at a medical
research center here.
Oh, yeah?
And what did he take?
Are you sure it was him
that broke into
the medical research place?
You have evidence?
We're confident.
He hasn't been
back to his house
in the past 24 hours.
Give us a call if
you hear from him?
Will do.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So, what's
your story about?
Oh, the story.
I don't know anymore,
actually.
You all right?
You sure?
Yeah.
Wake up, Sleeping Beauty.
Kenneth?
Kenneth? I'm coming in.
KENNETH: Darius?
Hey. What are
you doing here?
Everything's set.
We move the machine
to the Iaunch site.
Departure is at 5:00 p.m.
How'd you get in here
anyway? The spooks
are all over me.
It's crazy out there.
I had to sneak in
through the back.
Hey, we need to talk.
About Iast night. I know.
Last night
was a thunderbolt.
But I realize
our working relationship
became complicated,
so for now, maybe
we just re-focus and
concentrate on the mission.
Whose house is this?
It's my house.
My parents Ieft it to me.
Where are the Iasers?
Can you show me the Iasers?
What's wrong with your voice?
Where's the time machine?
The time machine is
at the Iaunch site.
Oh, right,
it's at the Iaunch site.
Darius.
What are you doing?
I talked to those guys
who are following you.
And they told me
that you stole
those Iasers because
you're some kind
of spy or something.
That's perfect.
Let them think that,
it works in our favor.
It's better. Seriously.
I also talked to Belinda.
What?
Yeah.
You did not talk to Belinda.
Yeah, I did.
I talked to Belinda.
I was just at her house.
No! No!
What are you doing?
She's alive!
She's alive! Okay.
This is good. Okay.
This means
the mission must have
been successful,
and we have saved her
and we've come
back to the present...
Hey, hey...
Hey, you can be
honest with me, okay?
I really Iike you.
Okay.
Yes. But this is the thing.
It's a complicated science
and cannot be
measured by our brains...
You can't time travel!
This is all crazy.
Okay, you Iied to me.
Listen to me.
What else are
you Iying about?
Hey, hey, Iisten to me.
You come to that
Iaunch site at 5:00 p.m.,
you take my hand
and I'll show you
who can't time travel.
Oh, shit!
AII right?
Darius! They're
right behind the house!
Wait...
They're right behind me.
Wait, you're with that guy?
Are you...
No.
Were you making fun of me?
No, I would have never...
Nobody was making
fun of you, Kenneth.
We are writing
an honest piece about
you for a magazine.
Magazine? Darius, don't...
We're not
making fun of you.
Get out of my house!
JEFF: We're on your side.
We're here to help.
No, I'm Ieaving tonight!
So is he really building
a time machine or what?
Why did you
make me do this?
I didn't make you do this.
You wanted the story.
You don't care
about the story!
You don't care about him.
You just came here
to hook up with
old girlfriends.
What's going on?
Hey, guys,
check this out.
It's open.
Watch your head.
I know what they
were Iooking for.
I saw it, it was Iike a,
Iike a jet engine
or something.
JEFF: It's gone!
Darius, have you
seen this stuff before?
What the hell was
he building in here?
DARIUS: I don't know.
You don't think
he actually built it,
do you?
Holy shit!
Move!
JEFF: Darius!
Kenneth, I'm sorry.
Were you making a joke of me
the whole time?
No.
I promise.
I Iied about the story,
but everything else
was real, okay?
That was really me.
Then get on.
Come with me.
The mission's been updated.
I'm going back for you now.
AII right. You trust me?
Come on.
Take my hand.
I know what
I'm doing, okay?
Flip that switch.
Do it. Flip it down.
Are you ready?
Go!
KENNETH: ...to go it alone
or to go with a partner.
When you choose a partner,
you have to
have compromises
and sacrifices,
but it's the price you pay.
Do I wanna follow
my every whim and desire
as I make my way
through time and space?
Absolutely.
But at the end
of the day, do I
need someone when
I'm doubting myself,
and I'm insecure and
my heart's failing me?
Do I need someone who,
when the heat gets hot,
has my back?
DARIUS: So, do you?
I do.
Stand straight
Fall back in Iine
Comb your hair
Get to work on time
Everyone in the big machine
Tries to break your heart
And pull you underneath
Maybe I'm wrong
And all that you get
is what you see
Maybe I'm right
And there's something
out there to believe
Everybody's
talking in their sleep
They push
a Iot of air around
But don't say
much of anything
Except when
they're laughing
Like some ghosts
under a sheet
Everybody's
talking in their sleep
Watch out
Get back in Iine
They'll trip you up
It happens every time
Way down
Is just a big machine
It can break apart
Like anything
Maybe I'm wrong
And all that you get
is what you see
Maybe I'm right
And there's something
out there to believe
Everybody's
talking in their sleep
They push
a Iot of air around
But don't say
much of anything
Except when
they're laughing
Like some ghosts
under a sheet
Everybody's
talking in their sleep
Nah, nah, nah, hey
Nah, nah, nah, hey
Nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah, hey
Nah, nah, nah, hey
Nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah, hey
Nah, nah, nah, hey
Nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah, hey
Nah, nah, nah, hey
