Hey, so this isn't
matching up with this.
So I'm not sure which
one is right.
Can you just hand down
the original for me.
- Yes, me do.
- All right.
Hey, what were you saying before
about the paperwork?
Me doing now!
Go.
Stop worry.
Kevin, do you feel okay?
Me feel good.
Body strong.
Sleep big last night.
Yeah, I think we should
get him to the hospital.
Yeah, all right, Kevin.
Why don't you come with us?
- No, no, guys.
- No, he's fine.
- He's always been like that.
- No, he hasn't.
I mean, he's gotten worse
over the years, but...
He's making a statement.
It's an ironic comment
on our expectations of him.
A funhouse image
of our model of Kevin.
You keep think that.
Me mechanic not speak English.
But he know what me mean
when me say, "car no go,"
and we best friends.
So me think,
why waste time say lot word
when few word do trick?
Kevin, I appreciate
what you're trying to do.
Thank.
Here, we have a word code.
The same way
we have a dress code.
And what we're talking about
is basically
the speech equivalent
to just wearing underpants.
Sometimes,
words you no need use
but need-need
for talk-talk.
But save time.
More success.
Does it save time, though?
'Cause we've been here
for about an hour.
No me fault.
Kevin...
At most, you're saving
a microscopic amount of time.
Many small time make big time.
And what are you gonna do
with all this time?
See world.
Kevin, you can't possibly
save enough time
to see the world.
Kevin, are you saying,
"see the world"
or "seaworld"?
See world.
Oceans, fish, jump.
China.
No, see?
Right there,
that's the problem
with your method.
'Cause I still don't know
if you're saying seaworld
or see  world,
and it's taking a lot of time
to explain it.
Fine. Fine.
I'll talk normally.
When me president,
they see.
They see.

This week, we are rolling out
the brand-new
sabre tablet...
The pyramid.
Ooh, why is it
shaped like that?
So you can tell your clients,
"unleash the power
of the pyramid."
It's huge.
How much does it weigh?
Oh, no, no, no.
Without the battery pack
and the optional
memory booster,
it's barely three pounds.
How much memory does it have
without the booster?
- I'm sorry, "L"?
- Mm-hmm.
How many "L" to a "K"?
You're really gonna
want the booster.
How on Earth
are we supposed to sell--
I'll take five.
Andy, don't make us
sell this stupid thing.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
This is Dwight's meeting.
- Thank you, the--
- I just wanted to pop in
and get your opinions
on ties and tie clips.
Which combo do you think
Robert's gonna like more?
What do you think, c-span?
C-span?
Yeah... C-span.
Cocker spaniel.
Spaniel 'cause of your
Spanish bloodline,
cocker 'cause...
Is this really the best use
of our collective time?
I am still forming a first
impression with Robert.
Once it is formed,
we can all relax, okay?
I'm sorry to hijack
your meeting, d-dub-dog.
Had to pull rank.
Okay.
Let's look at some ties.
Here's how I'm gonna
help out from now on.
I'm going to not care.
And I'm gonna
sit around quietly
waiting for Andy's
inevitable demise.
Your friend Neil Patrick Harris
really made me laugh
the other night.
Um, D-dog,
you have a message.
Erin, you don't need
to call him that.
Andy wants us to, P-dog.
It's okay, E-dog.
Just who called?
Justine. She said
she's coming by later.
Your ex-wife?
Wait, I thought
she was a
And you  hated her guts.
- Kevin...
- Oh, my God.
No, no, no, no.
I like her.
Well, I'm just quoting you.
I would never
say that about her.
I don't know the woman.
No, man.
We get along now.
Real well.
Wow. All right.
Can't wait to meet her.
I'll introduce you.
Yeah, we had a few fights,
I suppose.
But last night, we put
a lot of that to bed.
I can't tell you what I did
with my ex-wife last night.
I have to sing it.
We took a shower
we were naked
we
scap dap dap doo doo
doo doo doo doo doo
Hi, dad.
Ah--ohh.
Oh, boy.
Hello, Andy.
Excellent tie.
Would you be requiring
a cold beverage
while you're here?
I'd love some coffee.
I was looking over
your projections,
and I think we can to better.
Are you factoring in
the whole national economy...
Declining and all that?
Andy, do you know why
I chose you?
I think I can sum up
with what I think
is your favorite
ice cream flavor.
Vanilla.
Valla? No, no.
You'll never guess
in a million,
billion years,
you'll never guess.
You were saying you chose me.
There was a reason.
Andy, can you inspire?
Do you have that skill set?
Can I inspire?
I don't know!
I don't know.
Oh, thank you.
- Oh, uh--
- Oh, sorry.
Here, just put it down.
Oh.
Mm.
Ah. That is very cold.
Yeah, it's old.
Why would I--
I asked if you wanted
a cold beverage,
and you said coffee.
Why don't we get Robert
a nice, hot, fresh cup,
and I will have this.
Andy, you don't want that.
I've been craving a freezing
cup of old coffee.
Mmm.
Sorry.
You like her.
I-I do.
Yeah.
She likes you.
You know, we've both
been into each other
at different times,
and just never really
synced up.
Now we're in
this weird dance--
I'm afraid you've
lost my interest.
Let me call you back.
I gotta go.
If the office superstore
was supposed to put us little
suppliers out of business,
why are we still here?
Yeah.
This is where we go.
You'd go someplace else.
That's not it.
That's not the answer.
- It's a answer.
- It's a wrong answer.
- There are no wrong answers.
- Take a look at where you are.
Where you once worked
in a dying industry,
you now work at its birth.
The superstores
are terrified of us.
Anybody know why?
Wait...They're terrified?
Let me tell you how I buy
something these days.
I know what I want,
I go on the Internet
and get the best price.
Or I don't know what I want,
and I go to a small store
that can help me.
The era of personal service
is back.
You are back.
You'll find that customers
will pay our higher prices
and then they will thank us,
and we will say to them,
"you are welcome."
Ah, thank you.
Ooh!
Andrew, I chose you
for a reason.
Lead these people.
Show me the best numbers
this place has ever seen.
Last quarter we saw 4% growth.
Double it.
You got it.
- Double.
- Done.
- I'm not kidding.
- Neither am I.
It's already done.
Ha. I'm just kidding.
- It's gonna take some time.
- Double.
Hey.
Hey...
What's up, guys?
Just thought we'd have
a little rap session,
talk about business,
see how things are going.
Well, you start.
If no one else wants to.
I was just thinking about
Robert.
Man, what a boss.
Just...Throws down goals,
you know?
Anyway, how's the sales doubling
project going?
How are we supposed to do that?
We can't just press
a magic button.
Of course not.
There's no magic button.
You have to...
Summon that.
If we could just
double our sales,
we already would have.
You're not making sense.
He brings up two good points.
Do you have any new leads,
any new territories
you want us to look into,
maybe have an in
with a big client
that we could get
our foot in the door?
Dwight, anything?
We could talk about
how fast children grow up.
And before you know it,
they're out of the house.
You know what?
We need to get our heads
out of the box.
If we did have something,
what would it look like?
What would it be?
Tuna.
New leads,
a new territory to look into,
maybe an in with a big company
that we could get
our foot in the door.
Fart.
Good sesh.
That leg's asleep.
Hello.
I'm looking for
a Darryl Philbin.
Don't-- Oh...
You must think--
I'm not.
I'm using the fax.
This isn't-- No, wait.
I'm not supposed
to represent the company, right?
There's usually an Erin here.
- Okay.
- So...
Darryl!
A girl!
Rub a dub dub
with the apricot scrub
What's up, darling?
Hey, everybody,
this is justine.
- Hello.
- Hi, justine.
- Hi.
- This is Jim
and Oscar.
Hi.
Everybody.
Hello.
Kevin.
Can we go someplace private?
Follow me.
I got a space.
After you.
I been thinking about you
all morning.
I don't know what you did.
I can barely walk today.
D-bone.
There you are.
Let me guess.
Somebody needs a brownie!
Lick the spoon?
No, that's okay.
-
- I just-- I wanted to ask you
about...
Is this about the profits?
Because if it is,
I just don't see the point.
It's so wall street.
- I know, right?
- Right?
- Yeah.
- Ha.
Um...
How is everything?
Good.
Really, really good.
Must be a tough time
to be a family farm.
Oh, it is.
And beets are not immune.
We made some inroads in salad,
but heirloom tomatoes
are pushing back.
Oof. What are you
gonna do about that?
I don't know.
What do you mean?
Gotta be some way you could
double your beet sales.
You wanted the job.
The job is yours.
Just do the job.
And I'll...Do mine.
Walnuts?
No!
Have you seen this?
Yeah.
This is Cece's
favorite magazine.
She loves the pictures
of babies.
She looks at it
when she's on the potty,
and she makes the faces--
- Have you read it?
Has an adult member
of your family
read this particular issue?
I flipped through it.
So you saw the article
on the importance
of taking frequent walks
while you're pregnant.
- Of course, yeah.
- Everyone knows that.
I will be taking a morning
walk and an afternoon walk.
Would you like to join me?
That sounds nice.
Great.
You have a walking buddy.
I do!
- Thanks for coming in, guys.
- You don't have to thank us
for coming in-- It's our job.
Well, I never got thanked
for coming into a meeting,
and I always wanted to be,
so I'm gonna thank people.
What's under the blanket?
This is what's under
the blanket.
We...Don't get it.
These are incentives.
It's how we're gonna
double growth.
Now, you're probably all
asking yourselves,
"well, how does this work?"
Seems like a basic
reward system
where you give us points
and then we redeem those points
for prizes.
You're exactly right,
and you get a point.
- Oh!
- Is that a vibrator?
- 20 points.
- How does one get a point?
I've outlined the exact
parameters in an email,
so check your spam folders.
But basically...
You do your job better,
you get points.
So... Collect 15 points,
and redeem them for
this polar bear.
Why is it all kids' stuff
and a vibrator?
It's so gross.
There's lots of stuff.
John Irving, collected works.
Or you can pool your points
and redeem 55
for this maternity shirt.
-
- How about you want us
to work harder, pay us more?
I can't.
This point system
is really insulting.
Ooh. Well, I didn't
mean to offend you,
and I hope you'll forgive me,
because I'm very, very...
Sari.
It's a tablecloth.
What if went all the way up
to 500 points?
That's a crazy
amount of points.
- But what if?
- Well, what do you want?
I don't know.
For such a crazy number,
I'd like something
pretty crazy.
All right.
For 500 points,
I will wear a dress to work.
Ah!
That's pretty good.
What about, uh, for
I'll run naked
through the parking lot
with a doughnut on my dingdong.
Yeah? You like that?
All right, for 5,000 points,
I will...Let you
tattoo whatever you want
on the stern
of the old
- Oh!
- Here we go!
All right, all right,
and you are totally serious.
Swear to God, hope to die.
Now, let's get to work!
Wait. But you did say
we could pool our points, right?
In that case,
let's get to work.
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
- Whoo!
All right, thank you very much.
Uh, Phyllis, brachen auto?
Ask for Donald.
Karen's bananas.
I just want you to benefit
from our...
T-bag-bone.
Andrew.
Have you noticed just
a little bit
of a mood shift around here?
No, I haven't noticed anything.
Really?
Because I sat next to Stanley
for years,
and this is naptime.
- Yeah?
- Open-eye naptime.
He balances the phone
on his shoulder
and just powers down.
Now look at him.
You've got to unleash the power
of the pyramid.
I don't know
what to tell you, man.
You think it
has something to do
with that incentive program?
Oh, 100%.
We all want to see you
tattoo your ass.
Uh...
I think people thought
I was kidding
when I said that.
No, you definitely
weren't kidding.
That came across
loud and clear.
Oh, by the way,
wanna hand this in?
Yeah, big sale.
Don't worry about it, though.
I don't really care
about the points.
I would like
a point receipt, though.
Hey, yes, this is Jim Halpert
calling for Donald.
Can you hold on for one second?
Thank you very much.
Who talked to Maggie
at Kaufman's?
Erin.
Yes, Mrs. Guffner?
Right.
And I'm back.
How are you, sir?
Erin can squeeze a couple more
golf games in, right?
No, I'm not getting out there
anytime soon.
Hey, Kevin.
What are you doing?
Don't talk to me!
Hi, Professor Frank.
Andy Bernard, class of '95.
Hey, there.
Um, I'm a huge fan
of your management book,
Um, quick question.
I may be missing
a chapter here.
De-incentivizing?
What are your strategies?
Looking for a real blow
to morale.
Uh, why?
Well, um, I guess you could say
I'm in one of those classic
ass-tattoo incentive situations.
Yes!
Took 'em one day.
Are you ready?
"I'm not as think
as you drunk I am."
I like it.
I like it.
"Do not resuscitate."
Okay, let's keep in mind,
it's not too late
to choose another prize.
And there are
some great new additions.
My car--
For 1,000 points.
Or best offer.
What else you got?
Oh, and then this
was Phyllis's idea.
- Oh, my God!
- So nasty, Phyllis.
We were hoping you could do
something like this.
So coming out
of his butt is a--
- Baby.
- Baby.
Yes.
Yeah, no problem.
You should think about this.
Anyone have any better ideas?
I like what we have.
- Yeah, nice try.
- Yeah.
For sure what we have.
- It's funny.
- It's apropos.
Just need a second outside.
- You getting psyched up?
- Yeah.
Andy, nobody really expects
you to go through with this.
Tunes...
What am I doing here?
Why did Robert pick me?
Confession,
I don't know what I'm doing.
I mean, do you like it?
You having fun?
Tell you this,
everybody else is having
a lot of fun.
And you did that.
But my ass is only so big.
I mean, I can't do this
every day.
But I think it's big enough
to buy you some time
till your next great idea.
Which, by the way,
I can't wait for.
No one expects me to go
through with this, right?
Absolutely not.
Let's ink my stink!
- Andy!
- Yeah!
My heart belongs to music.
But my ass belongs
to these people.
Whoa!
Good stuff.
Do your worst.
Uh, you can keep
your pants on, actually.
If you just drop 'em
down a bit,
that'd be great.
They're already off,
my good sir.
I'd really prefer
they not be down.
Well, I think down's better.
Sweating pretty heavily
down there.
Do you think you could work
from this?
We made some small adjustments.
- Okay, you want me to--
- Just these few adjustments.
Yeah.
All right, let's begin.
This is where I grin and--
Ow! Ow!
That was just a cotton swab.
Invest in softer cotton, sir.
Whew.
Oh, boy.
Ohhh! Ho, ho!
Ohhh!
Whoa!
Obviously, you can go
the ass tattoo route.
And obviously,
I'm gonna like it.
Draw some blood!
Ha!
Ahhhhh-haaaaa!
Great tattoo.
Why did I choose Andy
to run the office?
Because he's all surface,
uncomplicated.
What you see is what you get.
Could be a recipe
for mediocrity, yes,
but then again,
it might just be
why people fight for him.
It's a nard dog.
That's my nickety-name.
- Yeah!
- Woo-hoo!
I love it.
I love it.
Pull up your pants.
There's something
about an underdog
that really inspires
the unexceptional.
Um, what should we talk about?
Well, we could talk
about an ethical dilemma
I'm having.
Oh, yeah, sure.
Um, I hope I can help.
A coworker of mine is drinking
caffeine while pregnant,
and I don't know if I should
call social services
about it.
Angela, that's pretty
transparently me.
Maybe.
You know, it's just herbal tea.
In mugs with trace amounts
of coffee.
Yeah, I think you should
call social services.
I already did.
You know, maybe we should just
have our own pregnancy as
in not pretend like we
are in this together.
- Fine.
- Fine.
