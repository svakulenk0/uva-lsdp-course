Who am I?
Do you know this?
Actually I am a nobody.
I'm even worse than a nobody.
I am this guy.
Stop the bus.
My life is not for straight.
Thank you.
But, well worth the telling,
because it is a girl.
Not that girl.
I do not think that a girl.
No, it is about this girl.
Jill Johnson.
As long as I can remember,
I'm already in love with her.
But they barely know that I exist.
-- Rick, come here, dude.
I have a rather clear.
I'll call you back. Okay, day.
What's up, dude?
-- Hello Trey.
I'm so excited for this school,
advanced things we are going to see.
I think that is only good.
Do you have C batteries with you? AA?
I have this new sandwich Sony
in my backpack, it's a Wi-Fi.
You have forgotten her, dude.
Look, I will show you something.
She even looks to you.
If I could tell her but
what I feel for her.
I've already told you,
it never gets what about Jill.
She draws on the popular gang
and there is no outsider.
Come on, that bendegedoe is not real.
That you think.
Look around you, Rick.
Look, there you have the Jacks,
the Nerds,
the Immos,
the Frodos,
the Scarfacegezelschap,
sexual predators ...
and even Rick-meppers.
-- The who?
Yes, those are new.
But what does it matter?
Because we have our own gang, me and you.
Thanks Trey, you're the best.
-- Am I there?
No.
-- Come now.
You and me, baby.
We two against the rest, okay.
You look good today.
It is her good.

And now let me show you our crown jewel.
The Amalgamated laboratory

Ga assured exploration.
All the animals were genetically manufactured
and each animal has its unique characteristics.
What are you beautiful.
Hello, birdie.
Hello.
She is beautiful, do not you think?
-- Yes, that she is sure.
I will make a photograph of her
for the schooljournaal.
Our only rules: the animals do not enter
and make no pictures with flash.
Most of our animals
are hypersensitive to light.
They flew away.
What was that, pummel.
-- Pak him, Lance.
Come now, Lance, let him alone.
-- That you thought.
Is there a problem, Lance?
No, no problem, Uncle Lou.
Mr. Landers.
Students, this is Lou Landers,
visionary scientist ...
and CEO of Amalgamated.
Well, I'm simply a businessman now.
The future of science
belongs to you all.
Enjoy the tour.
What's up with you?
-- Yes, this is healthy hoestbloed.
Rick Riker.
Are you not coincidentally the son
of Blaine and Julia Riker?
Yes, that's right.
Good people, what's new with them?
She died nine years ago.
-- But for the rest everything okay?
Yes, thank you.
Now I live with my aunt and uncle.
You seem from the same stuff
if your uncle.
Let us hope that ultimately you
even murdered.
That's because you've put me laughing.
The next time I'm your pain.
Our work with these animals helped us
to develop new antibiotics,
advanced pesticides
and a powerful, new pheromone,
that the animals impetus to couples,
compound called H2O-9.
It delivers a strong,
sexual attraction.
A single drop is sufficient

We want to use it
to multiply ...
One promising research
we do in these dragonflies.
And this has libelsoort
an enormous strength for his size.
Keep it tight boys, I come out.
We have the DNA of these
three libelsoorten injected ...
in seven new
superlibellen genetically improved.
There are only six.
Well, one missing libel
is the least of my concerns.
This month I have lost six tigers.
In this space, we keep our wildlife.
Would you not do something?
-- Once I've put it on YouTube.
Pak, slut.
I understand it. Yes, of course.
Thanks for calling.
That was the director.
Rick walked away from a school trip.
After such a long upbringing
he is still so unsettled.
Why do you think so, Albert?
-- I have no idea, Lucille.
And I taught him everything
what I know about the man.
And a good man are you,
after all these years that we are married.
Like on that first day.
You're probably already have some age.
-- And your hair is gray.
You've kraaiepootjes.
-- You have one hour needed to pass urine.
Your thighs look like cottage cheese
overgaf someone on a hot sidewalk.
And you had always been a small penis.
Well, what does it helps if you're in love.
Rick, we already asked us where you were.
You're so late.
It was time that you are at home,
your aunt was becoming worried.
You may continue late into the morning sleeping,
but do not forget to eat the fish.
Well done, my boy.
I do not know what saves,
but you seem not quite okay today.
Teenagers, I will talk with him.
Heavy day, huh?
Well, I ga not lie to you,
puberty is a difficult time
in the life of a young man.
Perhaps this book will explain
what is going on.
Once look, mood swings,
vochtophouding ...
and once a month you from your vagina bleeding.
This is likely to be
the wrong book can be.
The important thing is that you

Here, take a drink.

Today you drink your first beer ...
and tomorrow we can besnijden.
My patience is running out, Dr. Strom.
If you just a few minutes
could wait ...
I've had long enough
egomaniak waited for this.
We are the Board of Directors,
our time is valuable.
Not so valuable as my time, Mr. Carlson.
You see, I have a terminal illness
and I are fighting for years against.
But the disease has affected my organs.
At this moment I have one hour to live.
It was in advertising.
Gentlemen, if you are ready,
allow me then to show you the future.
What should this?
-- An innovation.
It will not only save my life,
but also the life of this company.
Too long have we try to make profit
with pills and injections,
while the fate of the large total healing.
A device that can alter DNA,
and the body are perfect health
can return.
You're crazy.
-- No, crazy is hearing voices,
with cats talk,
in step with Paula Abdul.
I'm not crazy, I am a visionary.
The machine was never fully tested.
If something goes wrong ...
Start the machine.
-- Yes sir.
Plasmaniveaus stable,
genetic adaptations to optimum level.
Sir, the core becomes overheated.
We have to abort the process.
Is it successful?
I'm sorry.
I want you know what pleasure it will be
to lead this company without you, and ...
Let loose, let me loose.
Gentlemen, it is time
we agree that what occurred.
How long have I slept?
-- Five days.

the principal scientist in the world,
Professor at the Empire City University,
where he has the rare substance Cerillium works,
I'm so proud to welcome him,
Dr. Stephen Hawking.
Thank you for that warm welcome.
I have a disease that has paralyzed me.
I can not walk and
I use this computer to speak.
But I'm not discouraged
because I have the gift of science.
That is a lie,
I think every day to suicide.
But you should rejoice
with your life.
You can walk, talk,

and sex experience.
I have many years no longer had sex.
My nurse is a lesbian
and it is not the hottest.
Hey, who would be high?
I have some hashish in their pocket.

High, high, high.
Ga from the road.
No brakes.
Ga from the road.
Madam, watch out.
How do you ...?
I can not believe what you just
the old lady have saved her life.
Amazingly.
Had I not pushed from the road
then she was probably dead.
You would really be proud of yourself.
-- You are a kind of hero.
Can you tell me apologize?
Voila. Really kind of you
for me to come help, Trey.
No problem!
I was still waiting to Rick.
My god, how did you do that?
It is simpler than it seems.
No, I do not think so.
Why do not you show me what is going on?
Okay then, there is something,
but you must keep the secret.
I think I have superpowers.
I can feel difficult.
-- Okay, what do you think of it.
You may get as many times as you like
but I'll bet you 100 dollars ...
that you never touches me.
Easy earned.
What can you do all?
Well, I do not know,
I am bitten by a libel.
Some dragonflies have an armed skin.
I wonder whether my skin also ...
Well, fortunately that worked well.
So you really have superpowers.
We can form a team.
Then we are famous, get a lot of money ...
-- Forget the chicks.
We will not be famous
and there will be no chicks.
Okay, so I have not asked.
I have been like everyone else.
That is not what your parents wanted for you.
You're not my father.
But I love you like your father!
I believe in you like your father.
I had sex with your mother like your father.
You'll never understand me. Never.
That is not what your parents wanted for you.
What a fantastic action.
Well Rick, have you enjoyed the opera?
Son, is something you cross?
It's so unfair, they have nothing.
I want things to change.
-- And that'll do.
One day, Rick, people will ask you
to be a hero.
When that day comes,
you will then be ready for his?
Give me your wallet.
And that, too.
people will ask you ...
to be a hero.
When that day comes,
you will then be ready for his?
Rick, please.
Rick, I'm on the die.
-- No.
But do not worry,
my brother Albert will you adopt.
Rick, the money is all yours.
Sell all shares of the company
called Google, it is worth nothing.
Invest in Enron.
Rick, I have something for you.

I'm not a superhero, I am a niemendal.
Is everything okay?
-- What, have you heard that?
You have nothing else

Like your mother.
Who was that?
-- My mother.
Listen, what about this morning

You made us really scared.

Me too. My parents, like

I am afraid I have to say no.
But, what is it?
That was last month.
The new promotion
appears to be quite popular.
Listen, I have to buy a car.
Frankly, Mr. Riker, you are the worst
candidate we've ever had.
Thanks for the loan, Mr. Johnson.
This is a good boy.
There must be something that I can do?

You should not touch those pills, Barry.
Why have you brought me here?

Well, can you explain to me

Yes, once.
-- What did you do?
Well, I said ... I told him ...
I told him about Jill that ...
when you look in her eyes
and they look back in your eyes, that ...
that you know that you would do everything
to a better man to be so ...
if you ever had the good fortune
to her ...
every second you could earn

its infinite charm and beauty ...
and her endless love.

I know exactly what I want.
I'm sorry if ongenodigd binnenval.
It is okay, we all hoped
that someone would open a window.
It was here rather stale.
So, this is the hollow of Dragonfly.
How did you know ...
-- No, no,
I'm not here to fight with you,
there are thousands of others who I want dead.
With this visit I would like to show
who will be hurt if you frustrates me.
Never.
Time to go.
The woman, Lucille Adams

How was she injured?
-- Heavy.
And Dragonfly?
-- Well, I can tell you ...

Doctor, how it is with her?
-- It is becoming worse with her.
They can not talk, not walk,
she has no control over her bowels.
This is terrible.
-- I know,
I've already created a MySpace page
with the name 'Crazy Shit Machine. "
She already has 40 friends.
Wait again, that is another his file,

-- Because she is dead.
Excuse me really Rick,
but there is something good.
Your uncle woke up this morning from his coma.
-- Yes?
But you can not have him tell your aunt,
he is in a fragile mental state.

to say goodbye to Lucille Adams.
Goodbye.
-- And now the treurdicht.
It is sad to remember
that this is the last time ...
I looked at the face
my wife can watch.
How could you afpakken her from me.
I can not live without her.
Sorry, there was a terrible mistake.
This is your wife,
she is the wife of this man.
Give me five minutes.
You're a lucky man.
Where is Lucille?
I have a coupon for a cremation.
I'm so sorry for your loss.
What is happening?
I know I said things
but I realize now more than ever ...
that we may never together.
-- I believe you do not.
You love me Rick, I know.
-- Jill, believe me,
I tell you this for your own good, I ...
I do not like you.
You are no longer in my top five.
How could you?
'Causes more than likely depression'
My God, you should look.
-- What are you doing, man.
You have to herpakken.
-- It makes no sense
Look at yourself,
you eat junk, you wear a nepbaard,
and we felt your costume in the garbage.
-- Well, I'm no longer Dragonfly.
But you said that Hourglass
Thousands of people went dead.
I've already told you, I am no hero.
Aunt Lucille is dead,
I am the only girl
that I ever loved rejected ...
and I can not even fly.
That klotelibel had never bite me.
Then you had your father never allowed.
Look at the words that your ancestors
that ring graveerden.
Honor, courage, sacrifice,
beauty, commitment, courage, justice,
unity, brotherhood, pride,
low prices, affordable housing,
easy trousers, internetporno advantageous.
The remainder is in Latin.
Rick, a hero of the road is dangerous,
maybe you'll fail or you will fly,
it is important that you use your intellect
and others from the emergency help.
If you are a real hero.
Perhaps you are right, but
even though I would like to stop Hourglass,
I do not know where to begin.
Where does he find a thousand people together?
Look.
... live from the Empire City Convention Centre,
where thousands of people together,
but none of them is more important
then the winners for the World Humanity Awards.
I do row.
Those shorter road through the park
has spared us some time.
You go now,
I'm looking for a parking lot.
Each year, the World Humanity Awards place
for the largest philanthropic performance honor.
This gala will be the most prestigious world leaders
Empire City to attract.
Look, there you have Prince Charles
and Nelson Mandela. Nelson.
I was also in prison, man.
One of the guests here Hourglass,
but what is it?
Thanks for us to invite, Mr. Landers.
Well, if you will be honoured by the world
do you want your family with you.
One day you might also be part
of our family?
Ladies and gentlemen, our first prize
goes to the medical breakthrough of the year.
For the pioneering work of his company
in the field of feminine hygiene ...
The price to Lou Landers,
Lavement of the year.
Lavement
He is the Lavement of the year
Is it not amazing, friends?
Is not he wonderful?
The Lavement of the year
Lavement
He is Mr. Lavement of the year
See him laugh, see him shine
He is the Lavement,
the Lavement of the year
Mr. Landers ...
-- Keep the Lavement up.
Halt, Landers.
-- Mr. Riker,
So, you know.
-- Be sure there.
Someone in this auditorium is the Hourglass,
I need your help to find out whom.
It may be about equal, a guest of honour,
or maybe even a toneelknecht.
Perhaps it is nothing, I have seen a man
with something that looked like a barrel Cerillium.
Who?
-- It there.
His holiness, the Dalai Lama.
This man is not who you think,
he is the trophy.
No, I am a man of peace.
-- Keep your mouth.
You did all these people murder
and I can prove otherwise.
Let the world see the weapon that you
under this garment hides.
I love you not for the crazy, Hourglass,
you hide below five kilos Cerillium.
What?
Pak him.
Peace, kal ...
You? You're the trophy.
Hourglass.
Heldconventie?
-- It is a convention for people ...
who like verkleden
in their favorite hero or crook ...
and indeed, your costume is worthless.
-- From the road.
Hourglass, I let you never committed.
-- Forget it, Dragonfly, you come too late.
Wegwezen.
Goodbye,
vliegje small.
Dragonfly.
-- No.
Dragonfly, you must stop Hourglass.
I can not, I can not fly.
If my life can learn a lesson, it is
that the spirit is stronger than the body,
the hero is inside.
This is a text of Celine Dion.
Never mind, it's the truth.
You're right.
It works.
Sorry.
Look, Dragonfly, while your city dies.
Where am I?
-- You are with me,
your lover.
'10 SECONDS TO ONSTERFELIJKHEID '
-- No.
'Rosie O'Donnel goes naked'
-- No.
Understand you now?
Think of off-earner families.
There is no time anymore.
It is over.
I have you.
Did you think I would have done something
with the girl I love?
Well, we still fall.
If I could do but fly.
Maybe I had absolutely no hero ...
and I had a normal job,
an accountant, a turnleraar.
This is a tall building.
It may take me no longer care,
if I die is that fortunately, in your arms.
You're my hero, Rick Riker,
and I love you.
Fortunately, there remained only 50 floors.
Shut up.
Thank you, Dragonfly, by you
our city is finally secure.
That sound you've said, Dr. Hawking.
At the end of good, all right.
Let us what not to eat, I treat.
Who am I? I'm Rick Riker.
I'm Dragonfly,
and as long as there is injustice and crime,
I will always be a superhero ...
