Hi. I'm Johnny Knoxville.
Welcome to Jackass.
Hello. I'm Johnny Knoxville
and I'm about to rent a car.
What's up?
Uh, I have a reservation.
Okay, I need a driver's license
and a credit card.
All right.
I need a signature here
that you're going to use
your coverage instead of ours.
Is that white one us?
Yes.
We're gonna walk around
and inspect it together.
Looks pretty good.
I'm just looking for dents
and major scratches.
Yeah.
Something major,
gonna write it down.
Little ding there.
Yeah.
No, we'll take
good care of her.
Thank you.
Have a good week.
You, too. Thank you.
I'm Johnny.
Hey.
We're gonna be doing
a hell of a lot
of work here today.
Trust us. We're gonna have fun.
Hi. I'm Johnny Knoxville,
and this is called the...
Oh, fuck!
Shut the car off.
Oh, fuck!
I guess we didn't reinforce
the windshield.
That fucker comes...
missed me by that much.
That's why you got the roll bars
behind you, dude.
Whose car is this?
This is your guys' car.
I rented it
from you earlier.
Yes. Yeah, wha...?
Yeah, I hit a dog.
A dog isn't gonna do that.
Come on in.
I had a accident,
as you can see.
I was...
I mean, I drink.
I just black out,
so I, um...
Were you drinking
or anything?
Yeah, I had a little,
to be honest.
Is there any license
plates on it?
There was.
Yeah?
Well, hopefully you guys
will incur some of the cost.
Oh, no.
'Cause I rented it
from you guys fair and square.
I don't want to get stuck
with the whole charge of it.
Well, you are going to get stuck
with the entire thing.
Well, I don't think
I should.
I think
you guys should help.
No. You declined
any additional coverage.
Right there.
You declined it.
Yeah, but that's
just paperwork, you know?
It's a legal contract.
Yeah, but I was a little...
I was...
I had a few to drink
when I signed that, too, so...
We're gonna have to
get this worked out.
Yeah, you're gonna have
to pay for that car.
Well, you're gonna have to
help me pay for that car.
No, we don't do that.
I returned it
with a full tank of gas.
You returned
it demolished.
Well, it's got
a full tank of gas.
That's the least of our worries
right now, is the gas.
Oh.
This is
an unmitigated outrage.
I've never seen anything
like this before.
What does that mean?
No one's ever done that.
Well, I can't pay for it.
Well, you're gonna have to.
Well, I ain't.
Look, I'm gonna let
you two guys work it out
and I'm gonna go outside
but, um, that car's gonna
have to be paid for.
"F" you!
You all right?
You all right?
Knoxville knocked my nuts
in half.
This is...
Oh, it hurts my teeth!
I can't even
turn it off.
I thought
it was supposed to help.
Okay, you ready?
Yeah.
Okay, okay, I got it.
I'm taking care of you.
- It's all right. Okay.
- Oh, my God, it's so bad.
It's cool. You cool?
I'm good. Okay.
Come on.
Ease up. Come on.
Daddy's gotcha.
Oh, my God,
it's so fucking bad.
Daddy's gotcha. Come on.
Whoo!
You're gonna have
tits of steel.
Oh!
Yeah, you're so
buff right now.
Yeah, this goes
on the gooch.
Yeah, it goes-goes around.
This goes on the gooch.
Oh, dude, he's done.
Who's gonna do the gooch?
In case you didn't know
what the gooch is
the gooch is the spot
between your balls
and butt hole, and...
Ooh!
Oh!
- Ooh!
- Does it smell?
- Does it smell like "man"?
- Smell.
Just smell it. Just smell it.
Ehren, smell it.
No, come on.
All right, let's
zap my nuts.
Yeah, yeah,
let's get it over with.
- Are we ready?
- They're so gone, man.
Okay.
He likes it!
He li...
He likes it.
Afternoon. How you doing?
Oh...
Son of a bitch.
What happened?
Oh, man! Oh!
Aw, fuck! Oh!
Well, now the cats
are rockin'
And everyone's feeling
all right
And on a Wednesday evening,
there's sure gonna be a fight
Yeah, a fight
I say somebody's gonna get
their head kicked in tonight
Well, now
everybody's groovin'
And everyone's shouting
for more
More
I say there's gonna be
a pool of blood...
I say somebody's gonna get
their head kicked in tonight
We're gonna rip up
the chairs
Tear down the walls
Smash up the band
And really have a ball...
The whole dance hall will be
a total mess
Well, the cats are rockin'
And everyone is feelin'
all right
All right...
Whoa!
I say somebody's gonna get
their head kicked in tonight
Whoa!
Oh...
Yes! That was the best thing
I've ever seen.
Tear down the walls
Smash up the place
Really have a ball...
And the whole dance hall
will be a total mess...
Oh, fuck, dude.
Oh!
...And on a Wednesday evening,
there's sure gonna be a fight
Be a fight!
I say somebody's gonna get
their head kicked in tonight.
Are you okay? Are you okay?
Are you okay?
Get over here!
Help him! Help him! Help him!
Medic!
No, no, no, no.
Don't move him.
Don't move him!
Oh, shit.
That had bad news
written all over it.
Are you okay? You all right?
That was like the worst thing
that could ever happen
right there.
John can't drive for shit.
I don't know what happened.
I just remember we went
in the air
and the next thing I know
I'm... just fucked.
Look at that cart.
Dude, you were hauling
so much ass.
We're here in Tokyo,
and I feel like partying.
Hi. I'm Party Boy.
Oh, can I try this?
Here we go.
It's my party music.
You like it?
Kind of makes you
wanna party, huh?
Kind of feel like
partying right now.
Ready?
See, that's what
the big ones do
but sometimes
they don't wanna...
Ow!
Fuck!
Don't pull on it, man.
You can't pry
his mouth open.
It's slowly
getting weightless.
Is he over?
No, you're twisting him!
You're fuckin' twisting him!
Oh, fuck!
He's-He's got my nipple, dude.
He's got my fuckin' nipple.
Wait, wait, wait,
he's gonna help you.
I know. I know.
Hang on, hang on, hang on.
Hang on.
Don't move.
Oh! Ow...
You little bastard!
Oh, look at the teeth marks.
Man.
I'm Bunny the Lifeguard
and if any of these alligators
try to ruin our swimming,
I'm gonna wrestle them down
and probably have my way
with them.
If he falls
and he lands near an alligator,
an alligator grabs ahold of him,
Steve-O will relax,
let the alligator take him
and hopefully the alligator
will release him.
Hi. I'm Steve-O, and this is...
Oh, shit.
There's no such thing
as failure, Steve-O.
Take another step.
You got it.
Aah.
One thing I know is
good tightrope-walking.
Oh, no.
Oh, yes.
You're cool.
You're good.
Put the chicken
on him!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Oh, shit.
There you go.
Yeah, there you go.
Food, food, food,
food, food.
Go back the other way.
No, keep going, Steve-O.
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!
Yeah!
Come on, Steve-O,
keep your head up!
Keep your head up,
Steve-O!
Keep your head up!
Keep your head up!
- You guys, you gotta do this!
- Keep your head up!
Keep your butt up!
You got it!
All right, all right!
Keep your butt...
Put it in your ass
and let him take it.
Come on.
Oh!
Stick the bone up your ass.
And let him pull it out.
Get ready.
Stay there.
Don't move. Don't move.
It'll be over
before you know it.
Don't look! Don't look!
Steve-O, don't look.
Don't look! Don't look!
Don't move! Don't move!
Hold still! Hold still!
He's going to the tail of it.
Don't look. - Don't look!
- Don't move! Don't move!
I ran straight
into a crocodile.
What the hell.
Oh, my God.
Why can't you walk
on a tightrope?
I don't know.
I thought you'd do it.
Yeah.
I just... I don't know, man.
I'm sure I could learn
but today... you know...
today was my first try.
I'm Bam Margera,
and my parents are dead asleep.
It's 12:42 right now
and Phil has to be at work
at 5:00 in the morning.
So he's trying to get
a good night's sleep
and I'm gonna go
wake his ass up.
I'm dying!
Holy shit!
Oh, my God, I'm
opening the windows.
Gettin' crazy over here.
Look at Phil's tummy.
Oh! Oh, my God!
Phil, you gotta be up
for 5:00 in the morning tonight.
Yo, here he comes.
Here he comes. Here he comes.
Jesus Christ, Bam!
I almost broke my leg
getting out of there!
There's shit
all over the goddamn...
How am I going to work now?
Go!
I... oh! Jesus!
That woman in the corner
cold playin' the role
Leave her ass in the corner
till her feet gets cold
Knowin' for a fact
that girl is wack
If you hold your hand out,
she'll turn her back
Better walk, don't talk,

Can't be her friend
unless you spend
Aah!
Wall to wall after all,

All your money at the bitch
'Cause she thinks
she's so... phisticated
So... phisticated
So... phisticated
So... phisticated.
What are you doing?
You know, I oughta
arrest you right now
with all that
in your clothes.
What's wrong with you?
What are you
talking about?
Get this out of
your pocket, man!
That's all me!
- All of this!
- All of that! That's all me!
What is this bullshit?
- What is the meaning of this?
- Those are my bananas.
Don't never come in
here no more, man!
What are you...?
Get out!
And take the other stuff
out of your pockets.
Geez!
Get it all out!
That's how you treat
an old man?
Get out! Go!
An old man that steals,
I can't believe it.
Hey, man, what kind of games
you play? Get out!
Get out, man!
Goddamn it!
What is wrong with you?
Get out!
Man, quit playing!
I was Lon Chaney's lover!
Go back and love him!
So, we're gonna go
to this hardware store...
they sell toilets...
and, uh, I'm gonna take a shit
right in one of the toilets.
I'm gonna shit my pants
before we get
to that fuckin' place.
Dave, fight it, man.
And I don't even want to make
a joke about it right now
because I just want
to hold it in.
Gotta poo?
Pretty much.
Really? Yeah.
Really, man, don't.
Do you want
to ruin everything?
I swear to God, it's...
Really? That bad?
Yeah, like it's a problem.
Is this the worst
you ever had to go boom-boom?
No, no.
I shit my pants at the fair.
Oh, dude,
he's shitting right now.
Get outta the car!
Oh, get out, dude, get out!
No shit, get outta here!
Come on, man,
get outta the fuckin' car.
Get outta the fuckin' car!
What do I do?
Did you shit?
Holy shit!
I'm taking a cab
back to the hotel.
He just shat everywhere.
What's wrong, man?
I had to sit there
while he shat.
I need to go home right now.
It's on my hand.
Is that a bolt?
We have very...
What the hell
you doing?
What's that?
What are you doing?
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm almost done.
I hope you didn't
take a shit
in that son of a bitch.
You take a shit in there
you get to clean it out, pal.
That is disgusting, man.
What a fuckin' "Froot Loop."
Want to playback?
Ow!
What the fuck? What the...?
Got him, dude.
Turn around.
Let's see it.
That was so much...
Oh... no!
- Yeah.
- Look at me.
That's a good one.
We're ready.
I'm Ehren McGhehey,
and this is the mousetrap.
You'll be the cat,
I'll be the mouse
You'll be the cat,
and I'll be the mouse
You'll be the cat
and I'll be the mouse...
Go, go, go, go!
...You'll be the cat,
yeah, I'll be the mouse
You'll be the cat
and I'll be the mouse
You'll be the cat, baby,
I'll be the mouse
Oh!
Oh...
Ow. All right!
All right! All right!
...You'll be the cat...
- Ow!
Aah! Come on!
Come on.
Okay, that's enough.
That's enough!
That's enough!
I call it! Hey! Time!
This isn't gonna work.
It might.
Wh-What's gonna happen here?
I don't know
but it's not quite
what's going to be intended.
Raab's putting
a fucking tampon on.
That's like
a Courtney Love-sized maxipad.
Dudes, this is, like,
worse than a hanging.
I'm Raab Himself and I'm
a complete fucking idiot.
Oh, that's funny.
It didn't work.
Nope.
We gotta get
another one, man.
Let's do it again.
Hey, I'm Raab Himself,
and this is Bungee Wedgie.
Is that your shitty ass, dude?
Look at the bloody,
shitty underpants.
Didn't give me a wedgie.
I went forward.
I can't believe it.
All right, we're here
in the Valley today
to do our own little
riot control test.
This is George Hruska.
All right, George,
uh, what do you do
All right, George,
uh, what do you do
and what are we
doing here today?
Well, I'm vice president
of operations
with ALS Technologies.
We manufacture
less-lethal ammunition.
We're one of the top
manufacturing companies
in the United States
and we're going to shoot you
with one of our projectiles.
It's called the pen-prevent.
It's a 40-gram,
tail-stabilized bag.
It'll be traveling
about 250 feet per second.
Is that lethal?
It's considered less lethal.
So, this morning I thought
I was taking it in the chest
with the beanbag projectile,
but George and his
company said no way
'cause if it hits me
in the heart,
I'm pretty much
done with, so, uh...
We want to take every
single precaution...
Right.
...necessary to help
protect your vital organs.
Where are my intestines?
Are they in that area?
I think so.
Awesome.
Ugh.
So you're gonna take
some practice shots?
Right.
Jesus Christ.
Yeah.
You know, this is nothing
to be messing around with.
This is nothing
for anybody
to just be thrown
into a.12-gauge shotgun
and-and, uh, you know,
think they could take it.
You know, that's one
of the reasons I'm doing this
is because I can do this
in a controlled state.
Safety's off.
Going hot.
That really hurt.
That looked like it hurt.
Oh, fuck, dude.
Did you see the way
I caught that beanbag
with my stomach?
That's instinct.
You can't teach that.
Oh!
It hurts so much.
Like going from a prone position
to standing is... ooh!
Ouch.
Hi. I'm Wee Man,
and this is a big cone.
Oh, my God, my brakes!
I can't...
My brakes!
My brakes! My brakes!
Stop me! Stop me!
Stop me!
Oh!
- You all right?
- That was so fast!
- You all right?
- Yeah.
You have...
Your brakes go out?
Yeah. The whole thing
doesn't work.
Really?
Will you push me to the top?
I wanna do it again.
I could sure go
for a Miller High Life.
Oh, you're
in so much trouble.
Kick her ass!
I'm about to get the shit
kicked out of me by a girl.
Dude, I told you
to keep up the left!
Oh...
I'm not gonna agree!
...seven... eight... nine...
ten.
That's the winner.
That's it.
And the winner.
And still champion.
Now pronounce her name.
Look at his bloody mouthpiece.
Oh, God, my jaw is, like,
two inches to the left.
I seriously felt all right
for a little bit
until she punched me
in the nose.
I knew she was fighting dirty.
One, two, three, four.
Oh, Jesus!
Go grab the dead kitty.
Dude, I've fuckin' been in there
before, dude. It sucks.
When the days are short
and the nights are long
And I walk and they walk
I twist and they twist
And I shimmy and they shimmy
And I fly and they fly
Well, we're out there
having fun
In the warm California sun
Where they're out there
havin' fun
In the warm California sun
Where they're out there
havin' fun
In the warm California sun.
Yeah!
Whoo!
Oh, God!
I've got your picture
Of me and you
You wrote I love you
I love you too
I sit there staring when
there's nothing else to do
Oh, it's in color
Your hair is brown
Your eyes are hazel
And soft as clouds
I often kiss you when there's no
one else around
I've got your picture,
I've got your picture
I'd like a million of you
over myself
I want a doctor
to take your picture
So I can look at you
from inside as well
You got me turning up
and turning down
I'm turning in,
I'm turning round
I'm turning Japanese,
I think I'm turning Japanese
I really think so
I'm turning Japanese,
I think I'm turning Japanese
I really think so
I've got your picture,
I've got your picture
I'd like a million of 'em
over myself
I want a doctor
to take your picture
So I can look at you
from inside as well
I'm turning up,
I'm turning down
I'm turning in,
I'm turning round
I'm turning Japanese,
I think I'm turning Japanese
I really think so
I'm turning Japanese,
I think I'm turning Japanese
I really think so
I'm turning Japanese,
I think I'm turning Japanese
I really think so
I'm turning Japanese,
I think I'm turning Japanese
I really think so...
Since we no longer have
to bleep cuss words,
I promise I will get my mom
to say, "Fuck"
by the end of this movie.
Hello. I'm Johnny Knoxville
and we're about to test
my rocket skates.
Go!
All right, this is
rocket skates, take two.
This one's gonna be
a little more powerful
than the last one, so...
Why, these are
different bottle rockets?
No, there's
just more of them.
Ow.
Oh, fuck!
What's wrong?
I fell and busted my ass,
that's what's fuckin' wrong.
That's it.
No more rocket skates.
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh,
ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh,
ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh...
- That's the way
- Uh-huh
Uh-huh, I like it
- Uh-huh
- Uh-huh
- That's the way
- Uh-huh
Uh-huh, I like it
- Uh-huh
- Uh-huh
That's the way...
God, this party sucks!
Hey, my man... wasabi, lots.
Wasabi.
Yeah!
So today, I'm gonna treat myself
to some...
Blech!
Little circles.
God, chopsticks are so stupid.
That looks like
a pretty good line, huh?
Whoa!
More.
Do another one.
Do another snooter.
I need a pick-me-up.
Oh...
Look out!
God, get back here!
I said, "Get back here!"
Get... Hey!
My transistor radio
comes from far away
And when it's night
over here
Over there,
it's a-breaking day
I remember all the good times
I had a-walking in the sand
With a beautiful girl
that I met made in Japan.
This is bullshit!
Ow!
Uh-oh.
Phil?
Phil?!
Phil?!
Hey, Phil!
Oh, my God.
Is this thing real?!
What thing?
This alligator?!
What?
Look, look, look!
Look around the corner!
What is that?
Where have you been?!
Don't you even look? Oh!
Oh, my God!
It's moving!
Look, Phil!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
I don't know
what to do now.
Aren't you scared to death?!
Ooh, it's so gross
that it's even on the floor.
I'm going out! I'm leaving!
Where's my keys?
That is the scariest
fucking thing
I ever saw in my whole life!
- I'm leaving.
- Don't leave.
Where the hell you going?
I'm leaving.
I swear to God!
Phil, seriously, please.
How are we going to get
this thing out of here!
I'm scared to death!
Oh, God!
Aw, man.
No! No!
No, I'm not going near it!
No, no! God, where is it?
Oh, great!
You don't have it, do you?
He's not there?
Seriously, is that real?!
I'm serious. Is it real?
Is it real?
- Is it real?
- Yes.
How dare you bring that
in this house!
Dude, dude.
Ow! Wait a minute!
Stop! Chill, dude.
Look at that.
He kicked your ass, dude.
I didn't even
get you.
You got beat up by Wee Man.
Dude.
Let me see.
He didn't even get you.
Where? I didn't even...
He didn't even get you.
Oh!
Let me see the back
of your head.
It'll be all right.
I'm here with Eric Koston
and Clyde Singleton
and today I'm gonna
and... or try to.
So, this thing's long.
Yeah, thanks.
Thanks for reminding me.
You got it.
I got it.
I got this.
Do you know,
is he gonna go?
- Yeah.
- Is he gonna go?
He's gonna go somewhere.
He's goin'.
Yeah, he's goin', yeah.
My impression
of Johnny Knoxville.
Something like this.
Ow, my face!
I'm Johnny Knoxville
and I'm gonna grind
this rail.
Ready, set, go!
Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah!
He made it
all the way down.
I can't believe he got
that far.
I can't believe
he got that far.
You made it
to the fucking bottom!
I can't, I can't...
This is the paper cuts.
I'm getting paper cuts
between the webbings
of my fingers
and the webbings of my toes.
Hold it still.
There's no good way to do it.
Yeah, I know.
So just deal with it.
Take a... take a breath.
Ow! Ow!
Oh, you can feel
when it goes in.
Oh, this one works good.
Gimme the next one.
Do it. Do it.
Ow!
Oh, yeah, opened up
with a good one.
Did you hear that?
- Oh, that was my flesh!
- Oh, dude.
If I do your hand,
you'll forget
about the pain
in your foot.
That is a good point.
Take a deep breath.
Aah!
Lance is trying...
Are you gonna puke?
- Watch Lance pass out.
- Lance is gonna puke!
From what, the pepperoni
or the paper cuts?
Both?
The pepperoni?
Is he okay?
I don't know.
Wait, is he all right?
- Medic!
- Hey, don't knock over the beer.
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm good.
Steve-O, if you want to do
some more, do it.
I'm done.
Is everybody ready?
Yeah.
Okay.
That looks funny.
Now that sucked!
God, am I glad I came down
to see what was going on
in this room.
Mm-hmm.
Wait a minute.
I know what my fortune is.
It's partying.
This is...
Oh!
I like big butts
and I cannot lie
I like big butts
and I cannot lie
You other brothers
can't deny
That when a girl walks in
with an itty-bitty waist
And a round thing in your face
you get sprung
Oh!
I wanna pull up front, cuz I
notice that butt was stuffed
Deep in the jeans
she's wearin'
I'm hooked and I can't
stop starin', oh, baby
I wanna get wit ya
and take your picture
My homeboys tried to warn me
- But that butt you got makes
- Me so horny
Ooh, rump of smooth skin
You say you wanna get
in my Benz
Well, use me, use me
'Cuz you ain't
that average groupie
I want 'em
real thick and juicy
So find that juicy double
Mix-a-Iot's in trouble, beggin'
for a piece of that bubble
So I'm lookin'
at rock videos
Knock-kneed bimbos
walkin' like ho's
You can have them bimbos
I'll keep my women
like Flo Jo
So your girlfriend rolls
a Honda
Playin' workout tapes
by Fonda
But Fonda ain't got a motor
in the back of her Honda
My anaconda don't want none
unless you got buns, hun
You can do side bends or sit-ups
But please don't lose
that butt
Some brothers wanna play
that hard role
And tell you
that the butt ain't gold
So they toss it and leave it
And I pull up quick
to retrieve it
So, ladies,
if the butt is round
And you want
a triple-x throw down
Dial 1-900-MIX-A-LOT,
and kick them nasty thoughts
Baby got back
Baby got back.
Oh, honey,
it's been a while.
It's a little too much.
No.
Irving, you think
you can do it?
You want a spot?
No, I got it.
I got it.
You got it?
Yeah, yeah.
If you need a spot,
just give me a call.
Okay.
What's the quickest
you ever knocked anyone out?
I hold
the California state record.
It's like 18 seconds,
including the-the 10-count.
I took it to the jaw,
I took it to the jaw
One, two, three,
there was never a doubt
We want fun,
and you might as well face it
We want fun, yeah,
you better believe it
We want fun,
no, you don't understand
Fun, fun, fun, fun,
make your demands
We want fun
and we can taste it
Yes, everybody get wasted!
I think
you're gonna break that today.
I'm Johnny Knoxville.
And I'm Butterbean.
Today, we're gonna do
a little boxing.
All right, you guys,
touch gloves
and come out fighting.
Get up!
Aw, man.
One more time.
This is the last time
you're kicking my ass.
One more time.
More pain. That's it.
You haven't even hit me.
Hit me once, at least.
There you go.
He's out.
Is Butterbean okay?
Look at this.
And by knockout
in the first round...
new champion, Butterbean!
Whoo! Yeah!
Where we going, Knoxville?
The hospital.
What the hell are
we doing that for?
I don't know.
Apparently,
I have a big gash in my head
and I think
I'm a little concussed.
Are you giving me a shot?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Are you okay?
Mm-hmm.
- We got one more to go, buddy.
- Yes, sir.
Then you're a free man.
Thank you.
You're gonna be
not feeling great
the next 24 hours.
- Thank you, Dr. Cooper.
- Okay.
You'll probably see me
in two or three days.
Hey! Hey!
Goddamn it!
What are you doing?
Hey! Get off, man!
- What's going on here?
- Get off!
Get off!
We're in Okinawa
and we're about to go swim
with some whale sharks
but first...
we need to go rub one out.
Well, I made the mistake
of showing them
what sea cucumbers do
when they're threatened
and that is, you know,
as soon
as something touches them,
these white threads come
out of the end of it
and, uh, Steve-O and Chris
thought it was a great idea.
So, they're out there
trying to, uh...
Masturbate?
...masturbate, yeah.
So, anyway, I-I apologize.
This is the...
With a simple shave
of the razor
Steve-O easily
disguises himself...
to fool the whale
sharks into thinking
he's a harmless young boy.
I am pretty nervous
about my wiener
around that whale
shark; I really am.
Now, the best way to think
of the whale sharks
they're like big
puppy dogs. Uh...
Sometimes puppies bite.
Puppies,
they have little teeth.
They have little teeth.
Little teeth.
You're gonna get a gummer.
All right.
So, it's kinda like being
with a gal with no teeth.
- Kind of, yes.
- Yeah.
So right below in these waters,
are waiting to eat
these freakin' shrimp
out of our crotches.
Okay.
Oh!
Oh, they kind of... they pinch.
Are these alive?
Aah!
They don't feel good
on the way...
You're part of this.
Look at this shrimp.
I guess I don't really have
any last words.
I'm just gonna kill myself
once I lose my wiener.
Come on, baby,
let's do the twist
Come on, baby
Let's do the twist
You look fine, yeah
When you go like this
Tell me, baby
Have you seen my sis?
Tell me, baby
Have you seen my sis?
She knows how to rock
And do the cha-cha twist
Aha
Hey, cha-cha-cha
Whoa, baby, cha-cha-cha.
My penis is really small now.
I can't really look cool
right now.
Hi. I'm Johnny Knoxville.
This is the tidal wave. Go.
How'd it look?
It looked good.
You just got... creamed.
Ooh!
Ooh!
I don't even, like,
pick a tattoo, like...
unless I'm pretty sure
that people are gonna laugh
every time they see it.
Oh, my God, dude.
Like, how do you perform
the fuckin' world's
dumbest tattoo?
Fuck, man, at least I don't have
to look at it, right?
My name is Henry Rollins
and this is...
Yeah!
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
This is really gonna
fuck you up!
Prissy motherfucker!
It's a total smiley face, dude.
Oh! Oh!
I just fully got a haircut
just, like, a week ago.
You're about to get
many more.
Oh!
Oh!
Yeah, me, too.
I am not doing it.
Look at Ehren.
Oh!
Oh, shit!
So, we're finding it
a little bit chilly in Japan.
We're gonna warm ourselves up
with some fireworks.
Uh-huh.
Let's go, dude.
Roll back there, just a bit.
Oh, no!
This is a bad angle.
Switch.
Oh, no, no, no.
Uh...
Oh.
Uh...
Ow!
Like, an ember fell
right in my corn hole, dude.
All right,
Johnny's double-knotting it.
Double knot it, but gently.
You may think
this next stunt is impossible.
You gotta squat a little,
Pontius.
Oh!
Ew!
Every time!
Ew!
Is Chris's dick
shorter or...
Yeah, it's a
little shorter.
Ow!
Keep it in! Hold it!
Stick...
It almost hit Loomis
in the face.
Goddamn, this is the...
Let's get fucked up...
Fuck!
...Let's get fucked up...
Mother!
...Let's get fucked up...
What a dumb-ass idea.
...Let's get fucked up...
I'm surrounded by cacti.
For fuck's sake.
Cactus!
It's cacti!
It's cactus.
Whatever it is, it hurts.
You wanna get up and cross?
This is the yellow snow cone.
Pack it in there nice and tight.
Little cold out here.
It might take a second.
Oh! There we go.
I'm not even worried
about the pee.
I'm just worried about...
Come on,
you're missing the cone, dude!
I'm sorry.
You're missing the cone!
You better eat
that whole thing, too.
You gotta go eat
that spot, too.
Aw!
Enjoy the snow cone.
Aw, you just wasted
a whole bunch!
Dude, get that whole mouthful
right there.
Keep going!
Keep going!
- Eat it!
- Come on, it's your pee.
Oh, come on.
I'm trying. It's so cold.
Swallow it!
Swallow it!
Oh, God.
Eat it!
Swallow it!
- No, no, don't...
- Oh, no, no. Oh, no puking.
I'm doing it!
Don't look at it.
Dude, it's dripping
out the bottom.
Will you catch that,
what's dripping out the bottom?
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, that was bad.
That sucked!
Kick yourself in the head,
Wee Man.
This is totally better.
What are you doing?
Are you starting
to lose your mind
on that shit?
Bam, stop it!
Now, you're getting crazy
on this shit.
"Ape!"
He's starting to lose it!
Jesus Christ!
Ape, I need toilet paper!
Ape, I need toilet paper!
Okay, this is called the...
When people tee off
when they're coming down
with their swing,
we're gonna blow
these air horns.
Here she goes again.
No. It's another one?
She still hit it pretty good.
What'd I tell you?
What'd I tell you?
That I'd come over here
and kick your ass.
Here, you lost
your club. Sorry.
Didn't I tell you
I was going to come over here
and kick your ass
for that?
But... I'm sorry.
I got bursitis.
- You got bursitis?
- Yeah.
So, that means you gotta play
with a horn?
It helps.
I'll give you something
to play with, pal.
Sorry.
It won't happen again.
- Oh, fuck!
- He's teeing off!
Get down! Get down!
Oh, shit!
Get back.
Get down, get down.
Watch this! Wait. Wait.
Oh, these things
are scary.
I'm Bam Margera.
I'm Johnny Knoxville.
And we're gonna be
burglars today.
Oh, God!
Fuck! Get the diamonds!
Dude, I told you not
to fall off the damn beam.
Turn around!
Fuck!
Aw, holy fuck!
Idiot!
Go!
Oh, fuck!
You all right?
You okay?
I'm good. I'm good.
What'd you think happened
right there?
It's embarrassing.
I was barely
halfway through the ceiling
and you were already
out the door.
You're a real sprinter.
Guys in masks, I'm out.
I don't play.
I don't play.
Is there any actual,
like, real reason...
why anyone would shove something
up their ass like this?
No.
I'm claiming predictions
for this event.
Where's Ryan?
Are you going to make them?
Number one,
it's not getting in there.
Number two, even if it does,
it's not staying in there.
Definitely no
sitting down happening.
Number three, there's no way
they're gonna believe
that this is true.
So, you're saying it's...
I'm saying there's
nothing I want more
than for this to happen, but...
You don't want it
to happen that much.
No, I really do.
This is our original talent
for this piece, by the way.
Yep. I think that...
It's one of the
first things I think
I've ever seen
you duck out on.
Oh, man, I am so glad
I turned this idea down.
I'm so glad.
Oh, yeah.
I'll probably use all of this
before the end of the segment.
Uh... what else we got?
A condom.
Thank you.
And, um, a little toy car.
Blue, it's my favorite color.
Let me see that. Dangle it.
Look at the reservoir tip.
Now I'm lubing up...
I can't see the car.
...the little toy car,
because I'm going
to put it in my butt.
Be comfortable.
Hey, Ed's here
for rescuing, dude.
You're here for
making it a problem.
All right,
you're gonna watch this?
You're making me
uncomfortable.
Sorry.
I gotta get another job.
Lube up your corn hole.
I am. I'm spackling.
Spackling.
Heart rate's going up
for sure!
Oh, dude, it hurts.
Your adrenaline's flowing,
isn't it?
There's no getting around it,
it fucking hurts like hell.
Come on in, Manny.
You're just in time, Manny.
Oh, Manny...
tell me I'm a man.
Man, it feels so goddamn gross.
This is insane, man.
This is...
this is totally insane.
- It's in.
- It's in, dude.
- It's in?
- Yeah.
- Let's see.
- Oh, fuck!
I feel like
I have to shit my ass.
Is there anything intact?
You said
that you didn't want to do it
because your dad
would disown you?
Well, I mean, it wasn't that.
You drank wine
off of a dude's ass crack.
My dad never saw that.
I never told him that...
you know.
I was gonna do this
and I was like, "Dad"...
I was, like, "Dad,
we're going hard these days
and there's some ideas
floating around."
I just mentioned
the car in the butt.
My dad, like...
the only time in my life
I ever heard my dad, like...
You know, it's like
when your parents say,
"I'm not mad at you;
I'm just disappointed," you know
like, that hurts so much more,
you know?
Fucking rad.
Look at him walk.
John's gonna win, dude.
I'm not too excited
about this skit.
It's not my favorite
I've ever done,
because there's a toy car
in my butt
but this is the...
I think I need an X ray.
Antoine?
Yes?
How you doing?
Pretty good.
I'm Ryan, and this is...
What can I do for you?
I was partying last night
with some frat guys.
I passed out.
I must have fallen down
or broken something,
because I haven't been able
to walk right since.
We're gonna take
X ray now, to be sure.
Okay.
- Take one of those.
- Oh, okay.
This is comfy.
Hold your breath.
Don't move.
What's that?
I have no idea.
That's not part of you.
That's something extra.
I would've known
if I ate that.
No. You wouldn't be able
to swallow that.
That is a car toy.
Well, how did a car toy
get there?
Maybe you stuck it up your ass.
I didn't stick anything
up my ass.
Have you ever seen
anything like that?
No, I never seen that in there.
I've seen a toy car all over
but never
in somebody's rectum.
You can't get it out?
You don't have...
No, I... I'm a physician,
but I practice this,
X ray only.
You think maybe I can just,
you know, poop it out?
You won't be able
to poop it out.
In fact, it will hurt you.
I fact, I don't think
it's even good for you
that you poop it out.
What will happen
if you take Ex-Lax?
Will that help?
No, if he takes Ex-lax,
well, he gets a lot of diarrhea
but no car.
I appreciate it.
Thank you
for taking care of me.
Okay. Thanks again.
Oh! He's alive.
Oh, Johnny Knoxville,
he made it!
Oh, there is a God.
Oh, please.
And at last!
I thought it would never...
This is the end!
Oh, thank you, Jesus!
Oh...
Oh, child!
Oh, child!
- Let's see it! Let's see it!
- Not that bad.
Moments like this
never last
When do creatures
rape your face
Hybrids opened up
the door...
Ooh, baby, when you cry
Your face is momentary
You hide your looks
behind these scars
In hybrid moments
Give me a moment...
Oh, fuck!
...Give me a moment
- Oh, fuck!
- Give me a moment
Ooh, baby, when you cry
Your face is momentary
You hide your looks
behind these scars
- In hybrid moments
- Bam? Whoa!
- In hybrid moments
- Ha!
Aah!
Go!
Ow!
In hybrid moments,
in hybrid moments...
Give me a moment
Give me a moment...
Whose dick do I gotta suck
to get some explosions
around here?
I can't expect you to see me
when I'm not around
And my voice is destroyed
by confinement of sound
I'm a human machine
laced with hidden disease
If the future looks bleak,
then you're connected to me
Flesh into gear
My self appears dissected
and pretentious
A simple sound,
a heavy sigh
Could win
the whole world over
You live in fear of being
someone you didn't want to
He's got a boner.
I realize your insecurities
will get the best of you.
Oh! Oh, fuck!
It's a man.
Whoa!
Ow!
Whoa! Ow! Ow!
Gator wrestling.
For fuck's sake,
come here!
Hurry up. Hurry up.
Hurry!
We wanted to see if
you would run here
with a car up your ass.
Oh, I ain't
runnin' anywhere.
It's scary enough to walk.
You're nice.
You're a good man.
Want to come over for dinner?
Oh, that's okay.
You know
how to operate it now?
Yeah, I think so.
I think so.
If you're gonna be dumb,
you gotta be tough...
- I need help.
- Yep.
...When you get knocked down,
you gotta get back up
I ain't the sharpest knife
in the drawer
But I know enough to know
If you're gonna be dumb,
you gotta be tough...
The smiley face is
a complete crucial.
...I lit my brain
with rotgut whiskey...
What did I say?
Fuck.
I didn't say the "F" word.
Yeah, you did.
You said, "Fuck."
- I did?
- Don't worry, we'll bleep it.
Can we cut that out?
...And I had dudes
with badges frisk me...
It looks fine.
It looks normal.
...To teach me
how to swallow pride
I took advice
no fool would take...
I think it says, "Fuck,"
on my forehead.
...I got some habits
I can't shake...
They don't have a tail?
No! They must have
taken them out.
...I ain't the sharpest knife
in the drawer
But I know enough to know
If you're gonna be dumb,
you gotta be tough...
Show him the X ray.
...lf you're gonna be dumb,
you gotta be tough
When you get knocked down,
you gotta get back up...
I mean, trust me, dude,
I'm not unimpressed.
...That's the way it is
in life and love
If you're gonna be dumb,
you gotta be tough
If you're gonna be dumb,
you gotta be tough.
Aw, fuck!
The next time, we can do...
Son of Jackass.
Son...
D-ohh!
Yeah, dude.
