Whoa!
Mush!
Now beat it!
All right, I'll leave, if
that's the way you feel about it.
But I'll leave like a gentleman.
Quiet, everybody! Ladies and
gentlemen, your attention, please!
You're about to take your last look at
Mr. Thornton's handsome, smiling face.
So make the most of it, you weasels!
But, as a last insane gesture...
Mr. Thornton wants you all to step up
to the bar and have a drink with him!
Quiet!
Are you ready? Let's go!
To the bar, everybody!
There you are!
Hiya, Tex.
Hiya, dude. The boys're
telling me you're going home.
Yep. Catching tomorrow's boat.
Well, there's no use in wishing
you luck. I guess you've had plenty.
Give me Michigan Avenue
on a hot afternoon...
and you can have all the yellow
dust this side of Seattle.
I guess we all feel the same way, kid.
It seems that all the homesick
guys in the world came up here.
- Put this away for me. It's wearing me down.
- Sure thing.
- Ah, they been kinda running
against you. - Yeah- Oh, thanks.
Give us a couple more stacks. Here's where
I'm apt to earn my fare back to Seattle.
There you are.
Did I say Seattle?
You'd better quit while you still have
the price of a pick and shovel, dude.
What's the matter? You want your grave
dug? Give us some action! I'm buying!
Well, the hot seat went cold, eh?
Yeah. Yeah, I hope so.
Well, so long, fellas.
- So long.
- So long, dude.
Russ, my stomach wants
to know how my credit is.
Well, if your stomach's as good as
your credit, you'll live to be 100.
Thanks. Did I ever tell you about
my grandpa? Died when he was 106.
- What interrupted his youth?
- He quit drinking.
So they cleaned you out, eh?
- That's tough.
- Ah, there's a lot more where that came from.
What's the matter, Mr. Thornton? Ain't you
speakin' to your pals since you got rich?
Well, hello, Shorty! How are ya?
- Have a stimulant.
- Thanks.
- When'd you get out?
- This afternoon.
These bastilles up here ain't as cozy as
them stirs down in little ol' New York.
The finest jailhouse I ever seen
was the Coney Island precinct.
- They sent you up for opening the mails, didn't they?
- Shh! Shh!
That was a miscarriage of justice.
Listen-Ah!
All I did on that mail route was peek
in a couple of those bill o' dues.
It gets darned lonesome
on the trail there.
I was as innocent-like as if I was
sittin' in the New York Public Library.
Letters are supposed to
be private, even up here.
Well, if I wasn't honest trying to
seal it up, I wouldn't have got caught.
- That's too bad.
- Well, I wouldn't say that.
- That letter I opened was very interesting.
- Yeah?
Yeah. If you'd have saved a bit of your
bankroll, I'd have cut you in on somethin'.
- Oh. More mail?
- Yes and no.
That letter I opened was
worth about a million bucks.
Thanks very much for the snort-ola.
Ah! See ya around sometime.
Hey, Shorty! Shorty! Wait a minute.
Let me hear a little more
about that pipe dream of yours.
Pipe dream is right.
I been dreamin' about this for six
months up in that cold Arctic can.
- Yeah? What do you need
a bankroll for? - Well, I-
Hey, youse guys! Get outta here!
Boo!
I need a bankroll to grubstake
us as far as Dawson City...
and then a long way beyond that.
- Yeah? That sounds interesting.
- You know somethin'?
When they caught me
opening those letters...
and the judge presented
me with six months-
or, as the English jockeys
say, a dozen fortnights-
well, that judge asked me a lot of silly
questions, like how many letters I'd jimmied...
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
- But there's one question he didn't ask me.
- Yeah?
He didn't ask me what
was in that letter.
- Say, is your credit still good in there?
- I wouldn't be surprised.
- Come on. Let's go and exhaust it.
- Okay.
His name was Blake. Martin Blake.
He had red whiskers and,
well, he was a little blind.
Oh, yeah, I remember. He was cracked.
- Told everybody he'd found a rich lode.
- That's the guy.
Well, he got sick on the trail. He was
coming to Dawson City to file his claim.
He wrote a letter to his son,
John Blake, in San Francisco.
He had a note on the envelope
- said if anything happened to him...
the letter should be mailed.
Well, his number was up,
so the letter was mailed.
And you looked inside to be sure
everything was neat and in order.
Mmm. But there wasn't
much of a letter.
It was mostly a map.
You made a copy?
As I'm coming to the backstretch with a pencil,
I feel the long arm of John Law on my shoulder.
- Did they take the copy away from you?
- No.
- Then you still have it?
- No again.
Well, what'd you do with it?
I et it.
When that map started to digest
though, see, it sorta went to my head.
Went to my brain.
So, while I'm sitting up
there in the booby hatch...
I made a copy of it from memory.
Take off my boot.
Well, I'll show you. I
got a good memory too.
Course, there's a couple of things
here I don't quite figure out.
Now, you see...
I don't know if this is
a mountain or a river.
And I think they said
there was rapids here.
But I don't see how that could be,
because I don't remember no river up there.
Hey, listen, little man, the graveyards
up here is full of gold hopheads...
guys that smoked a pipeful of hope...
had glittering yellow dreams and ended
up under a pile of rocks in frozen ground.
Me, I'll take bourbon.
Kills you slower, but a
lot more pleasant-like.
Now, wait a minute, Mr. Thornton.
Something mighty
strange happened today.
- Something mighty strange.
- Yeah?
Sit down.
I'm standin' out in front
of the Palace Hotel, see.
Not doin' nothin', because, well, you know,
a fella just out of the can and broke...
just lookin' and standin' is
about the limit of your activities.
- Yeah.
- Well, it was a good idea, see.
- 'Cause things started happenin'.
- Yeah?
Out of this hotel comes the most beautiful
skirt that you ever put your peepers on.
And following her is a
dignified-lookin' guy-
I'd say 46 autumns.
And him and her get in the sled and
they go off, headed for Dawson City.
- Thanks for the society note.
- Yeah, but wait.
I get excited, see, I run into the
hotel and take a look at the ledger.
You know the names of these
two interesting people?
Mr. and Mrs. John
Blake of San Francisco.
Old man Blake's son?
I hope, in my subtle way,
I've made myself clear.
You have.
Look, if I get the money for
an outfit, how do we split?
Even-steven.
Okay. Wait here. I'll be right back.
Listen, they got a day's lead on us.
- It's only a gamble.
- That's what I like about it.
Hot-
What's the matter with this fido?
Sorry, Jack, but that one's taken.
Belongs to a team I sold yesterday.
I'll tell you what. I got a big fella
I'll give you for practically nothin'.
Fifty bucks!
What's the matter with him?
- He ain't broke yet, and I don't think he's gonna be.
- Oh. Tough, huh?
St. Bernard. He's all animal, Joe.
- He's on a hunger strike.
- Won't eat anything?
Nothin' but your hand or
your foot, or points north.
- He looks like he was stolen
from some joint in the States.
I never ask a dog no questions.
- Blue ribbons don't mean
nothin' to a pooch up here.
- How'd you like to see me make this guy eat?
- All right by me.
- I ain't got nothin' to do all winter.
- Get some grub.
- Frank, dinner for one!
- Unharness Little Boy Blue. Put him right there.
- Dinner for one.
- Okay. Let him out.
- I hope you know what you're doin'.
- I hope so too!
All right, let go of him.
All right, pull your dog out!
Don't let your dog get this piece.
He'll eat regular from now on.
I wish I had time to break
him. He'd make a great dog.
- All right, Frank, put him back.
- I'll do it. Here.
My name is Smith.
Are the outfit and provisions
ready that were ordered in my name?
Well, why don't you answer me,
Groggins? You speak English, don't you?
Uh, y-yes, sir. H-
Here's your whole outfit.
- Tenderfoot, huh?
- Not as tender as he looks.
If I'm not too inquisitive,
will six dogs be enough?
- They'll pull the load, all right.
- With me on it?
Well, I don't know about that.
You don't look like a man who knows
much about anything, Mr. Groggins.
that people come up here don't
usually make a buggy ride out of it.
They walk or run with the
dogs, sometimes break trail.
You sure will need more dogs
if you're gonna ride that sled.
And more dog food.
And a needle and thread.
What for, my intelligent friend?
To sew up the guys that's gonna
split their sides laughin' at ya!
Once in a while people do laugh at me.
But very briefly.
Well, sir, dogs! Dogs!
Uh, bring Flip and Frowsy.
Say, Joe, why don't you show the
honorable Mr. Smith this beautiful animal?
I don't think so. He's too savage.
Is that so? Well, just let him out.
- He's liable to get tough, Mr. Smith.
- Let him out, I said.
- What's his name?
- We call him Buck.
I don't like to take the
responsibility, Mr. Smith.
That's why you'll
never amount to much.
What are you asking for him?
Uh, 250 bucks.
Sold. Let him out.
So your name's Buck, eh?
You're tough, huh?
Hey, wait a minute. That
dog cost me a lot of money.
- I pay for my pleasure, Mr. Groggins.
- Wait a minute.
That dog belongs to me.
I bought him, Smith, and I
don't allow my dogs to be shot.
That is, of course,
unless I shoot them myself.
That's all right. I'll give
you twice what you paid for him.
He's not for sale.
Just as you say, my good man.
Just as you say.
Well, what others have you?
- Uh, here. Hitch 'em up.
- These two will do.
I ordered a collapsible bathtub
from Seattle. Did it get here?
You sweet meats.
You're losing your home.
Easy with ye.
Come on. Out.
Come on. Come on. Come on, Harmon.
Here ya are, Mr. Smith.
We thought it was
something to pile wood in.
The only bath a person gets up
here is by the sweat of the brow.
How interesting. Mush!
Been a great pleasure, gentlemen.
A great pleasure!
Nice guys.
Well, I don't like to
see a dog killed either.
But after all, 250 bucks is 250 bucks.
All right, I told you
I'm buying him, and I am.
- We ain't got no time to fool with him.
- Quiet, quiet.
Whose money is this?
Listen, you, you're my
dog, and I'm your boss.
The sooner you learn that, the easier
it's going to be for both of us.
Ho! Ho!
Right there!
Hey!
Go on! Get back there! What'd
you bring this baboon along for?
- That big guy don't like him.!
- That's just too bad! He'll learn to like him!
- Come on! Let's go! Mush! Mush!
- Get your teeth out of him.!
Come on! Get up there!
Come on, gray boy!
Come on, Buck.
- What's the matter?
- Nearly took my wing off.
Come on, big boy.
We don't mean you any harm.
We're trying to be friendly with you.
Buck, come here!
Come on, boy. Nobody's gonna hurt you.
Come on, now, be-
Buck! Hey, Buck! Buck, come here!
Well, you can kiss
that 250 bucks good-bye.
Yep. It's too bad too.
He'd have made a great dog.
Now he'll either freeze to death,
or wolves'll get him. Poor fella.
Make yourself at home, Buck.
Hey! Look, boss! Wolves!
No, he isn't dead. And he isn't a he.
Hey, you know who that
is? That's Blake's woman!
Oh, John! Oh, John
darling! I'm so glad!
Oh.
Oh- Oh,
I thought-
Is my husband with
you? Have you found him?
You're the only one
we've found so far.
What about your husband?
I don't know.
We ran into trouble...
and we lost most of our
provisions crossing the river.
The ice broke, and
- and then some of our dogs died.
Two days ago my husband
went out to look for food...
and he hasn't come back.
Do you think he's dead?
That's a pretty good guess.
What are we gonna do with her?
What can you do? Take her
to Dawson and leave her.
You're forgetting one thing, pal.
- Yeah?
- She and her old man was looking for the same thing we are.
And they had the map
- the original one.
You'll find my husband
for me, won't you?
There's nothing we can do. We're
a thousand miles from nowhere.
Either the cold got
him, or the wolves.
- Get on the sled. We're taking you to Dawson.
- But you gotta help me find him.
He isn't dead. I
- I don't believe that.
Hey, listen, lady, in this country when
a guy is gone for two days, he's gone.
I refuse to go until I
definitely know about my husband.
If you don't wanna stay and look
for him, you can go without me.
No! No! Put me down!
Put me down! I can't go!
I've got to stay! Put me down!
Stop! Stop this sled!
Whoa! What's the matter?
- You untie these straps.
- Oh, no, no. You might fall off.
I'm doing this for your own
good. Later on you'll thank me.
I hate you, you beast!
Let me out of here!
Sticks and stones may break my
bones, but words can never hurt me!
Whoops! Ha!
- Let's go! Mush!
- Mush.!
Beans.
It's customary up here, Mrs. Blake, for
everybody to pitch in and do their share.
You've been with us two days, and you haven't
done anything but sit around and look nasty.
Yes, I'm considered
a very excellent cook.
Huh. Well, how about giving these
beans the benefit of your talents?
I'll do nothing to help you.
I'm your prisoner, and since you seem to
want me with you, you'll take care of me.
Want you? We just had an attack of insanity
and decided to keep you from committing suicide.
Very bad idea, come to think of it.
Hey! You're forgettin'
our guest of honor.
Thank you, Mr. Hoolihan.
- Hey. Gimme. Come on, gimme.
- Hmm?
Say, uh, Mrs. Blake, if
I ain't too inquisitive...
what was you and your
old man gonna do up here?
Work.
Oh. Looking for the yellow stuff, eh?
Probably.
Can't understand it, a guy taking
his wife way out in the wilderness.
Stupid, if you ask me.
Mr. Blake had an excellent reason.
Yeah?
Yeah. He loved me and I loved him.
Well, I wouldn't let him go alone.
Undoubtedly, that will still impress
you as being a very stupid reason.
We thought it an excellent one.
I still think it's stupid.
Have some coffee.
It might warm you up.
Well, tell me somethin'.
Uh, didn't he have some object?
Wasn't there somethin' he was after?
What I mean is, did he have a hunch,
or did somebody give him a tip?
- I'm very tired, Mr. Hoolihan, and I know you must be.
- Me, tired? Heck no!
Well, I thought you might be,
asking such personal questions.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Boss, she's a woman in a million.
- You think so?
- Yeah. She don't talk.
Oh!
All right, get on with the dogs.
No, thank you. I'll
cross the way you men do.
Hold on! Hold on!
Hurry up! Hurry up!
Don't forget the gun!
Say! Nice, modest little
prices they have here.
They practically give things away.
Say, boss, how much we
got this side of the grave?
Just about enough for
a room in a poorhouse.
This mansion over here'll do. Come on.
- Come on, Buck.
- Come on, Buck.
Well, Mrs. Blake, I guess it's
about time to say good-bye.
There's an officer of the
Mounted Police down the street.
They'll get you back to the States.
We'd stake you ourselves, only,
well, we've mislaid our funds.
Yeah, yeah.
Well, you've been very
nice, Mr. Thornton.
I
- I suppose I was a little difficult, but...
- well, losing someone you've
grown to love isn't- - Yes, I know.
I'm sorry I was so rough.
Well, I
- I'm sorry I was so unpleasant.
Mmm. I'm sorry that I can't think
of a thing to be sorry about.
Ohh!
I suppose you've got friends
and relatives back in the states.
No. My husband's all I had.
- Why do you ask?
- Because we got a proposition to make.
Yes?
We know what brought you up
here. We've known all along.
I mean, old man Blake's claim.
But how? How could you possibly know?
Give me that map, Shorty.
Did you ever see this?
Or, uh, something like it?
Yes. Yes, I've seen the original.
This won't do you any
good. It isn't correct.
I know it. That's why I
was going to suggest that-
My husband had to borrow
and beg to make this trip.
He went through all sorts
of horrible difficulties and-
I know. Well, now he
- he's gone.
That's why I was
going to suggest that-
And you were gonna take
it away from him, steal it.
Oh, now, please be reasonable. Why don't
you come in with me and Shorty on this thing?
Where our map is incorrect, give us
the right route. We'll be partners.
And, well, while you're about it...
I suppose you may as
well consider all angles.
We need your information about this.
We could probably find the mine ourselves
without your help. It would take longer.
Of course, you don't
know us very well...
except that we're a
little rough on women.
We might play you dirty.
We might take your information and then
tell you to, well, go jump in the river.
On the other hand, we might
be on the up-and-up with you.
Let me see your map.
This river here
- it isn't a river, it's a dry creek.
- And that mountain peak, that's down here.
- Criminy! That's it!
Ha!
All the other mistakes are minor ones.
All right, Mr. Thornton,
now you can tell me-
How did you express it?
To go jump in the river?
We've gotta do a lot of jumping ourselves
to get the 700 bucks for the outfit.
- Seven hundred dollars is hard to get.
- My, oh, my, oh, my.
But we'll get it, if we have to take a knife,
stick somebody and take it away from 'em.
- Yeah!
- Come on, Shorty. Mush!
- Come on. Let's go.
- All set.
Keep your fingers
crossed till we get back.
We've gotta make a touch, Shorty.
Something that means more to
me now that just finding a mine.
Yeah, I been noticing that.
You're the doctor. You
know what's good for ya.
The way I figures it, hunting
for gold's a full-time job.
Anything that interferes
with it, interferes with it.
- What do you mean?
- You know what I mean.
Mind keeping that fat snoot
of yours out of my affairs?
All right, all right. No offense,
boss. No offense whatsoever.
- Where's Buck?
- Hmm?
Come on!
My, oh, my, oh, my, oh, my!
Can't you see that's poisoned meat?
That's the second
time he's attacked me!
Yeah, he's crazy about you!
Can't you see?
Wait a minute, partner. I'll give
you a chance to make some money.
- I doubt it.
- I'll give you $300 for him.
- Ha.!
- Five hundred.
Nope. Not interested.
I'll give you $1,000!
That's a fabulous price to pay for a
dog. I could get a team of six for that.
What do you expect you'd do
with him if I let you have him?
Give myself the exquisite pleasure
of putting a bullet through his head.
Yeah, that's what I thought.
No, thanks. I'm sorry I can't
contribute to your fun, mister.
Boo!
Well, Jack, my boy, how is tricks?
Hello, Sam! How are you? Glad
to see you. Sam, this is Shorty.
- Hello.
- Ah, yes!
Just seen the argument you had
with that fellow back there.
- He doesn't seem to like your dog.
- No, no.
The dog doesn't like him either.
Look, Sam, how you fixed?
Uh, pretty nearly flat.
But anyhow, I got enough to ask you
gentlemens to join me in a drink.
- Bourbon, straight!
- Ditto!
Likewise! Come on, boy! Come on!
Schnapps?
Well, Sam, here's to
your very good health.
- Skoal.
- Prosit.
You know, that's a lot of money
that fellow offered you for your dog.
Yeah? That's a lot of dog too.
- Hey, boss, let's head for the hotel, huh?
- No, no, no, not yet.
Maybe somebody we know will show.
Ole! Ha-ha! How are you?
I got lots trouble.
Nowhere I can get two dogs, cheap.
What matter, huh?
I got load of thousand-pound flour...
I got to get over to 40-Mile Creek.
Two of my dogs, they die.
It's too big load for the
other four dogs to pull.
Quiet, now!
Yo! That's one fine dog, mister!
You want to sell, maybe?
- No, I don't.
- I'll say he don't!
You know, that fellow back there...
- One thousand
bucks? - Mm-hmm.
What the dog do? Spit gold dust?
He's the best dog you've ever seen.
He could pull that load of
yours without any help at all.
- Sure! I'll bet you he could.
- Well, he could.
How'd you like to make a
little bet on that, partner?
Haven't any money to bet.
I hear of one dog in Nome...
he pull 800 pound.
But he dies dead to do that.
Ah, no dog can pull 1,000
pounds. It's impossible.
Well, then it's
impossible. Let's drop it.
Is it all right to
look at him, mister?
It ain't every day we can see a
dog that can pull a thousand pounds.
Come on, boss. Let's get outta here.
What's the matter, gentlemen?
If I overheard correctly...
the argument is whether or not
this dog can pull a thousand pounds.
I'm willing to bet a
dollar a pound he can't.
He won't bet. Says he's broke.
I don't want money
from you, my friend.
If your dog is able to do
it, I'll give you the $1,000.
- If he
can't- - Well?
Why, then, I'll take the dog.
No.
Mister, you wouldn't want to own a dog
that couldn't pull a measly thousand pounds.
- Sounds like an easy way of making money to me.
- Sure.!
First he shoots off his mouth.
Then he won't go through with it.
Well, my friend, these gentlemen seem
to think I'm giving you the best of it.
Don't do it, boss.
Let's go outta here.
A thousand dollars.
It's a bet!
It's a bet!
I think you make one
big mistake, mister.
But, well, we go outside.
- Thornton's crazy!
- If Jack says his dog can do it, he can do it!
- Ten-to-one he
can't! - It's a bet!
- Any more takers?
- I'll take ya!
- I got a poke that says you're wrong.
- I'm right!
- But it dies dead to do that.
- The dog will do it!
- Gee, boss, he can't do it. He'll kill himself trying.
- Shut up.
You're not only doing this for money.
You're afraid of getting stuck
here and losing that Blake woman.
Oh, all right.
Your dog is to pull the sled a
hundred yards from the standstill.
That's the bet.
All right, all right!
One, two, three, four...
All right, get back.
Nobody touch that dog.
five, six, seven, eight,
nine, 10, one, two-
Dog is gonna draw a
sled. Just stand there.
The dog will do it!
It's plenty load for one dog to pull.
The dog will do it!
Five, six, seven, eight, nine-
Keep your hands off that
dog, now! You understand?
Oh, I beg your pardon.
Seven, eight, nine, a hundred.
Go on, mister. We're waiting.
Buck.
Buck! Come on, boy!
Come on, Buck! Mush!
Come on, boy! Mush, Buck!
Come on, come on, Buck!
- Come on, boy.
- Stay away from that dog!
Buck, come on!
Buck! Come on, boy!
Come on, whitey! Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Hooray! That dog done it.
- He all right?
- Hope so.
Oh, I beg your pardon, old boy, but
haven't you forgotten about the money?
The gelt? Please.
Mmm! Thank you, sir.
- Oh, say. You know something?
- Well?
You'd make a good dog biscuit.
- What's that, a halter?
- Yeah.
Hmm. Being as I'm working like a
horse, I just as well look like one.
There you are. Now hang on to this.
Is that all?
Did you remember nails?
Nails. Hammers and saw. Look.
You bought 'em yourself. What's
the matter with you this morning?
- Nothing. Get out.
- Mmm.
Oh, hey, listen-
There's something we did forget
- a medicine kit.
We need some iodine and
quinine, just in case.
Yeah, all right. I'll get 'em.
Hmm. I hope it won't be
too heavy for you to carry.
- See youse later.
- All right.
Say, uh, what do we need
the nails and hammers for?
Well, the snow's disappearing fast.
We'll have to cache the sled
later on and build a boat.
Oh?
Say, uh, look-
Yeah?
What is it?
I, uh-
I got something to tell you. Maybe
you better take it sitting down.
You know how I feel about
women in this country.
Where we're going is ten
times as tough and rugged...
- as anything you've seen up to now.
- What are you getting at?
Well, just this.
I paid your room rent
here at the hotel...
and I'll leave you enough money
for expenses until we get back.
You mean I'm supposed to wait
here while you and Shorty go-
That's it.
I've been wondering whether
you'd try something like this.
Well, if you're going, I'm going too.
- You mean you don't trust us?
- I mean exactly that.
All right, Shorty and I will
stay here. You go find the mine.
- Oh, don't be smart.
- Well, you're not going.
Wouldn't be fair to
you, or to us either.
Slow us down to a walk and
make us carry double provisions.
Besides, it's more of a risk
than I want to see you take.
Believe me, that's my only
reason for making this decision.
If you don't like my way
of doing it, do it yourself.
- You can have my share.
- Oh, so you're gonna give me my mine, are you?
Well, thank you very much. You'll
not leave this town without me.
We'll leave without you.
You'll wait here and like it.
All right, come on. Let's get going.
- How about the iodine and quinine?
- I'll get them.
If that female iceberg comes out and
wants to tag along, smack her down.
Wonder what's happened now.
Oh, well. You know, I know a couple of
people used to fool around like that...
and they got children now.
You, uh
- You still want to go along?
Not only do I still
want to go, I am going.
All right, come on. Let's get going.
Mush! Mush!
Hey! Hey! Come on!
Mush! Mush!
Mush!
- What's up, Sergeant?
- They just brought a fellow in.
- Picked him up on the Skagway Trail.
- What happened to him?
It seems like he left his
sled to go hunting for food...
then couldn't find his way back.
He was almost a corpse
when they found him.
- What's his name?
- Well, we found these on him.
Name seems to be Blake
- John Blake, San Francisco.
Here it comes.
Say, it even looks like a raft.
Thanks. I always
wanted to join the navy.
- Will there be room for the dogs, sailor?
- I'm afraid not, matey.
- They'll have to run along the bank.
- Very well, sir.
Be careful of that varnish
on the deck, you two gobs.
Step right in, commodore.
Ca-
Toot, toot!
Hard aport!
Come on, Buck. Come on.
The way I figure it, we
go 100 miles upstream...
then we follow a creek
that runs into it north.
Huh!
Never fails.
Oh, you pretty things.
That's right
- north for about 40 miles.
And then all we gotta do is-
Oh, if you could only cook.
Then all we have to
do is find the knoll...
upon which stands a tree,
half-shattered by lightning.
And the cabin.
Near that knoll.
Gee, I wonder what
it's gonna be like...
having things instead
of wishing for 'em.
Hmm.
Not nearly so much fun.
You're wrong, Claire.
Wishing never got anybody anyplace.
It's owning something that counts.
Taking it when you can't get it any other way
- that's all right too.
It's the law up here
- The law of the Klondike.
When there's something
you need, grab it.
Take it away from the other guy.
It's a good law.
It works.
Nope. It only works when you
deserve to have what you take.
Otherwise it's stealing.
Perhaps that particular
commandment isn't respected up here.
They all get broken.
That one gets splintered.
Well, Noah...
that boat manipulating's a little too
tough for my delicate constitution...
so if you don't mind,
sir, I shall go below.
Good night.
- Night, Shorty.
- Night.
Good night, dice.
Summer's just around the corner.
I can smell it.
You know, somehow
Dawson and Skagway and...
even California seem like
places I've just heard of.
Seems as if I've lived out
here in this wilderness forever.
Other people and other places...
never existed.
But there's one thing I do remember...
and that's a very
kind and wonderful man.
I wonder what Buck sees in the fire.
What are you thinking of, Buck?
Well, he's probably
remembering more than thinking.
Remembering back to the time
when he was more wolf than dog.
When there was only one law-
the law we were just talking about.
It's getting late, Jack.
Think I'll say good night.
Not guilty, Your Honor.
Cabin!
- The tree!
- The mine!
Oh, boy!
Hey, somebody pinch me.
That does it.
It's just as it was in the letter.
My, oh, my, oh, my. I do declare.
Hey! Hey, boss!
Boss! Come here, quick.
Hmm. Look at this.
Oh, my. Oh.
Lookit, lookit! Tell me
if I'm dreamin'. Lookit.
Holy mackerel.
It's gold, Claire. More gold than
I've ever seen in my whole life.
Oh!
Oh, be careful!
Hey, if we panned this
much in an afternoon...
think what we'll get in a month.
Gee, I wish I could stick around
here a couple of days longer.
You know, I been dreamin'
of this moment all my life.
I'm sorry, Shorty, but
you got to file a claim.
As long as the trails are open, some
prospector is apt to discover this creek.
First to register
gets discovery rights.
You're the boss, boss.
- When I get to Dawson, first
thing I'm gonna do- - Don't.
- Don't what?
- Get drunk.
Not a chance. I'm gonna
catch up on my meals.
I like coffee, and my stomach's
been getting weaker every day.
Well, so long, kid.
- Don't spend it all in one place.
- So long.
Well, good-bye, Mrs. Blake.
Good-bye, Shorty.
Come on, dogs.
- Hey.! Hey, Shorty.!
- What?
You forgot your meal ticket.
Oh! Oh, yeah. Come to papa.
Snake eyes.
My, oh, my, oh, my. I do declare.
Well, good-bye.
- Good-bye.
- Bye.
What's the matter, boy?
Buck!
- What's biting him?
- I don't know.
- What's that, Jack?
- Wolves.
That's funny. They don't
usually come so close to camp.
Buck! Come here!
Buck, come back here!
If that's a pack, they'll
kill him. Buck, come here!
He's been changing lately.
Haven't you noticed?
Seems as though he
remembers things up here.
Buck, come back here! Buck!
Buck! Buck, come here!
Well, well. Welcome, stranger.
How are ya? Huh?
Well, seems we still
mean more to him than-
than that old memory.
Hey, hey, wait a minute.
You better come inside
before you change your mind.
Come on, tough guy. Come on.
Oh, that's grand music.
Yes.
That's grand music.
That's lovely. Come on.
All right, come on now.
Let's pull. Together.
One, two...
- three-
- Oh!
Well, we weren't together.
- Oh, I wish you hadn't.
- Why not?
I haven't let myself think about us.
- I didn't dare.
- Why?
Oh, I don't know. I-
I've had sort of a
strange premonition.
I don't know exactly
how to explain it, but-
Explanations belong 5,000 miles away.
I only have one question...
and I only want one answer.
You know the answer.
I don't want to know the answer.
It just struck me, Mr. Blake.
Now my back please, Kali.
I say, Mr. Blake, it's just
struck me that so far...
I've taken this
entire matter on trust.
I believed your story and put
up the money for this outfit.
I still believe your story,
but I think it's time...
you gave me a little
more positive proof.
When I asked you in Dawson
City to help finance me...
I told you I knew the
location of a very rich mine.
I still know where that mine is.
I'm taking you there.
But the map, Mr. Blake-
Why do you continually
refuse to show us the map?
I see.
Well, what's to prevent
our taking it away from you?
The possibility that
such a map may not exist-
except in my memory.
Violence will do you no good.
You've come this far...
and now there's nothing you
can do but go all the way.
You'll gain nothing... by killing me.
Now, now. Who talked of killing?
We're not pirates, my dear man.
We are gentleman adventurers
on the road to great riches, eh?
Come, come, Kali. My towel.
Say, Jack.
- Buck's gone again.
- Yes, I know.
- I heard his lady friend howling last night.
- Oh?
Well, that's what happens to a
fella when he gets in bad company.
Mmm!
Wait a minute.
According to all you told
us, and to all calculations...
we should have located
the mine two days ago.
I'm afraid you're bringing
out my worst side, Mr. Blake.
- Yes, I-I know, but- - If
you're trying to hoodwink us...
we are certain to find
it out sooner or later...
and if such is the case...
there is nothing left for
us to do but mourn for you.
I swear I'm doing the best I can.
I followed the compass
directions exactly.
- The cabin! That's it!
- My dear Mr. Blake...
how can you ever forgive me
for doubting your integrity?
You've placed me in a
most embarrassing position.
I scarcely know what to say.
One for the master.
And one for the dame.
And one for the little
boy who's filing the claim.
Why, Jack, I never suspected.
The world doesn't understand me.
At heart I'm an artist.
Oh, I want to write
poetry. I want to compose.
I want to sing, paint.
- Barns?
- Yes, yes. Those too.
I want to starve in a garret.
Wear me hair long. Get
egg on a flowing tie.
In other words, be a genius. Ah
- But no.
No, the world sneers at me talent...
and instead it gives me... gold.
Oh, my poor boy.
You seem to have all the
comforts of home, Mr. Thornton-
A comfortable cabin, golden
evidence of more comforts to come...
and a beautiful lady.
You will oblige me greatly
if you will assist...
in making this incident
as painless as possible.
Come on, get it over with.
What are you going to do?
Do? My dear man, nothing at all.
The important thing is-
We're going back by water,
Kali, using Mr. Thornton's canoe.
As I was saying, the important
thing is to prevent you people...
from filing claim on this
charming site before we do.
And how do you expect to do that?
Oh, very easily-
by leaving you here and destroying
all means of transportation.
- If you can't get back to
Dawson to file, why, then...
- you can't get back to
Dawson to file, now can you?
So we'll file instead.
If you want to work the
mine while we're gone...
you're very welcome
to do so, of course.
We'll be glad to recompense you
for your trouble when we get back.
Meanwhile we'll take with us your
gun and ammunition, axes, et cetera.
It would be a grave
error to leave behind...
the implements for building
another canoe, wouldn't it?
Kali!
Look here, Smith. Why
can't we do business?
I'm always open to an honest
proposition, Mr. Thornton.
We'll give you the claim, all of it.
You can have what gold we've got.
But leave us some way of getting out
of here. The winter snows are coming on.
My dear man, you call that
a business proposition?
We already have the mine, and
the gold is ours by right of-
How shall I put it?
By right of conquest.
Do you mind if we don't
argue the point anymore?
Let's help ourselves.
Mr. Thornton would
only squander the gold.
I must commend your sense
of humor, Mr. Thornton.
Very few people would be able to
smile on an occasion like this.
- Thank you.
- Not at all.
I remember watching a magician once.
From an apparently empty hat,
he shortly produced a rabbit.
He smiled very much as
you're smiling now...
because, I imagine, he
knew all the while...
You've something up
your sleeve, perhaps.
Perhaps.
Roll up your sleeve, Mr.
Thornton. There's no rabbit there.
Come, come. Don't let's
strain our friendship.
Madam.
Careful, you idiot. You
might have split the bottom.
We'll be back, my friends.
For the time being, good-bye...
and good-bye.
Look out!
Well, they wanted
gold. Now they got it.
Hey, Claire, get the medicine
kit and some hot water.
Is he badly hurt?
Yeah. He's got a nasty
crack on the skull.
Some prospector, I guess.
Go away, Buck. Get out of the way.
John! John!
Claire, dearest...
I'd like to talk to Mr. Thornton.
All right, dear.
I thought I'd...
lost you.
Try to rest, please.
He's feeling much better this morning.
He remembers everything, thank heaven.
It wasn't so serious as we thought.
He wants to see you, Jack.
What are you going to say to him?
I wanted you...
and I took you with us.
Well, I'm keeping you.
Jack.
You know I love you, don't you?
You couldn't doubt that, could you?
Well, he needs me.
You have your law and...
I have mine.
Best thing you can do, Blake, is to
get out of here as quick as you can.
You need medical
attention. Take the canoe.
It's easy going now, but it won't
be when the heavy snows come on.
Will you come with us?
No, I'll stay here and work the mine.
When you come back in the spring,
we'll divide what I've found.
I came to say good-bye to Buck.
He never would have forgiven
me if I'd forgotten that.
Would you, Buck?
You could have skipped that.
You're only making it
tougher on everybody.
Oh, Jack, put your arms around me.
Well, I'll be seeing you.
Yes.
You'll be seeing me.
I'll be seeing you too.
Every day and every
night and every minute.
This isn't the end.
It can't be.
Careful of that first stretch of
rapids. After that it's clear sailing.
Good-bye, Thornton.
And God bless you.
Good-bye, Blake.
Good-bye, Jack.
Good-bye, Claire.
It's hard to say no to
that call, isn't it, Buck?
It's all right, boy. Go ahead.
Shorty?
- Yeah!
- Shorty!
- Hello, boss!
- Why, you old son of a gun.
You came just in time.
You saved my life.
Well, look at you.
You're all dressed up.
Yeah. We're in the
money. I filed the claim.
We're rich
- Richer than Astor's pup!
No trouble at all. I went
right in and signed the names.
- Oh, and the
claim was- - Shorty.
What's that?
That's our new cook.
- Where'd you get it?
- I won it in a crap game.
