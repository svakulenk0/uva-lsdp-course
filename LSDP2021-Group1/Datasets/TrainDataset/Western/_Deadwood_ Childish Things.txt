What did you know about me, Bullock?
First we met?
- No concern for my feelings, huh?
- That you were a killer.
Certain facts show in the mug.
Look at her.
- You know she's fucked for food.
- What's the point?
In your mug, there is no such history.
Are you a cunt-driven, near-maniac
or a stalwart driven by principle?
The many cannot tell, for you yourself
are so fucking confused.
But you do make a good appearance...
so they're prone to grant
you their trust...
which we will use as an asset
in the coming campaign.
What's the campaign?
You have friends in Montana in high
positions, some type fucking judge?
- I've cut ties with the judge in Montana.
- Amiably or owing money?
Maybe you're mistrusted less
as a killer...
than showing your cards
a corner at a time.
Our cause is surviving.
Not being allied with Yankton or cogs
in the Hearst machine...
to show it don't fate us as runts, or...
two-headed calves or...
pigs with excess legs,
to a good fucking grinding up.
I only mention the judge in Montana...
toward maybe drumming up interest
in us there.
Annexation to Montana
instead of Dakota?
Hiking our skirts to Helena
might put Yankton back on its heels.
And as minutes turn to hours
over the piss-pot, I wonder, should we...
ruminate publicly in loud voices
over forming a new territory...
with an eye towards future statehood,
or even our own republic?
No dictatorship?
What the fuck do we need
a dictatorship for...
that silences the public voice,
that eases the enemy's way?
Noise made, overtures to
outside interests and...
enlistment of the hooples' participation
is what this situation demands.
And a trustworthy mug
with a vague motive...
out there, bugling the call.
I'm not interested.
Our moment permits interest in
one question only.
Will we, of Deadwood...
be more than target for ass-fucking?
To not grab ankle is to declare
yourself interested.
What's your posture, Bullock?
As you see.
Huzzah, then.
"The operations of
the old Aurora and Keets mines, and...
"a number of smaller adjoining claims,
are now entirely consolidated...
"accessed through the former
hidden-treasure property.
"Anxious as I know you to be,
Mr Hearst...
"to move to 24-hour operation...
"until workers at wage outnumber
individual prospectors in the camp...
"the matter of Chinese labour remains
delicate of introduction.
"And we must therefore rest content
with Germans...
"and Cornish unwilling to work at night.
"We shower them after every shift...
"and the gold they've combed into
their hair with grease...
"we recover from the traps installed
beneath the wash-house facility.
"The Cornish are quicker than
the Germans but...
"ever ready to combine and complain.
"And deserve their reputation
as high-graders...
"which, if anything, is understated."
"Through the vigilance of
our security fellows...
"the unremitting larceny of
these cunning and...
"clannish men is held
somewhat in check.
"I cite in particular the effectiveness
of Captain Turner...
- "invaluable to us since the Comstock."
- Watch it!
"With purchase of the claim formerly
operated by the Manuel brothers...
"we will control, save one,
the Garret property...
"every considerable deposit
now discovered."
"I am told your arrival is imminent,
Mr Hearst.
"I look forward to showing you every
aspect of what I believe soon may be...
"truthfully described as the largest...
"and most forward-looking
gold operation in the world.
"Francis Wolcott."
No one is with child.
Tessie may have clap.
We'll take her off the firing line, then.
With whatever intervening supervision...
I take it these new-arrived
Chinese whores...
- to be under your control?
- Well-evaluated, Doc.
I'd be available to see to their care,
like I do these here.
Declined, with thanks.
You may not be aware
that beyond their afflictions...
these girls are fucking starving to death.
I ain't one, Doc, holds the white man's
as the sole and only path.
I strive to tolerate what
I may not agree with...
but those people's culture,
their women are disposable.
They ship them unfed,
replace them when they expire.
They dose them with opium, I know,
which I gather eases their pangs.
Well, under this arrangement...
I withdraw my care for your whites.
- For Christ's sake, Doc!
- No, I need to live, too!
Raise your rates on these, then. Don't
disrupt the other fucking equilibrium.
I would see to those others pro bono.
I know what that means.
Prove to me you do.
- It won't cost you anything.
- Well, Jesus Christ.
Here, too, let me tolerate
a different point of view.
- Studying on a getaway, Tom?
- Ain't she a beauty, Al?
In the French, it's called a velocipede...
meaning "go swiftly into the world."
This is the gent's Boneshaker model...
and the French can stay
the fuck out of it.
How's that for a contraption, boss?
Someone from Farnum, that...
cunt with the long kraut moniker.
E. B. Ain't been over for coffee.
Should I ask if Farnum's
come for coffee...
before I get you to summon that cunt?
Dead and without a body...
you still outstrip him for intelligence.
Would you please know
Mr A. W. Merrick?
- I'm A. W. Merrick.
- Good.
I'm Blasanov...
agent for Cheyenne and
Black Hills Telegraph Company.
- Welcome, Mr Blasanov.
- Thank you.
Can you show me immediately to
my apparatus?
Our long-anticipated telegraph operator.
Your company, having leased space for
you in my office, your apparatus, sir...
is next to mine, and I will show it to you
with pleasure. This way.
Has my apparatus been... Thank you.
Been guarded from interference?
In candour, Mr Blasanov, some nights
more successfully than others.
There's a fucking pair to draw to.
I hope the electrical fluid is not
blistered with fierce voltage, someone...
- foolish to ground its potential.
- I'm not aware of any blistering...
and my hopes in that regard
may be different from yours.
Did you see my bicycle, young man?
They call that type bone-shaking, sir.
They do, for a mortal truth.
Look at it this way, then.
Mightn't the Lord give second chances?
Not on merit, necessarily.
I ain't claiming that.
Say he does it on whim, on any basis.
And here she comes...
with that little one beside her
and another she fixes to produce.
And keenness to
my shortcomings don't...
blind me to seeing a-right,
that when a boulder needs hauling...
I will haul a boulder,
which is asset to a woman...
with a child in her care
and another she readies to deliver.
Now, what harm is there in believing...
that not taking a chance might be
a confounding of His will?
I'm taking that silence for
fucking support.
- Mrs Bullock.
- Thank you so much for seeing us.
- Good morning, William.
- Good morning, Mrs Garret.
Please, come in.
It smells awful nice in here.
We had berry tea
before Sofia's lesson.
Will you have some?
- Please, if it's not a trouble.
- I don't want any, thank you.
I didn't know the smell was from tea.
Will you show William your corner
in our other room, Sofia?
Not your toys.
Show him only your books.
Thank you.
And thank you for the candy
when I first got to camp.
Please, forgive the suddenness
of my coming.
Not at all, Mrs Bullock.
I feel an urgency about the matter
which brings me.
Please tell me what it is.
You know that Miss Stokes...
the teacher for whom
we'd waited so long...
Has fled.
Yes.
A great disappointment to me,
as I'm sure it was to you.
I hope I'm...
adequate to guiding my son's studies.
I believe I am...
but a child in solitude cannot find
his gift for society.
What do you propose?
That I teach the camp's children.
The water is usually brought from
the kitchen, already at a boil.
- Please don't bother with the tea.
- It's no bother.
It would hardly be a bother,
if I were only properly prepared.
On a second opportunity, with adequate
notification, we will meet you in order...
and readiness.
I seem always to come upon you
with inadequate notice.
As you remarked,
simple courtesy would forestall that.
I'm trying to imagine
what courtesy of mine...
would have forestalled
the last awkwardness between us.
Do you wish, then, to take Sofia
under your care as well?
As well as whom, Mrs Garret?
Why, Mrs Bullock, as well as your son.
Whom else would I mean?
Good morning.
Good morning, Mr Swearengen.
Excuse me. Change of light.
Pupils slow adjusting,
hope that don't owe to morphine.
- No.
- Anyhow, thanks for...
brushing against my prick.
May I sit down?
Too early for you?
- I don't time my drinking.
- Dan!
$50,000. Now, to me.
Mr Dority signs for the murder of
Brom Garret...
on my orders, as commissioned by
his faithless wife.
Second document, signed by you.
Detailing during transport to New York
for trial, along with faithless wife...
Dority escapes custody.
$50,000, now to me. $10,000...
now you to Dority.
$10,000, now you to Adams.
Agreed, with these amendments.
$25,000 to you on signatures...
on Dority's safe return
following his escape...
and by your giving over the document...
signed by me to an agent
designated by Pinkerton...
or burning it in the agent's presence...
the second $25,000.
- Agreed.
- Will you draft Dority's confession?
I'll draft both fucking documents.
Now, would you find your own way out...
while I explain myself to the guilty party?
You want to brush agin my prick?
Got a good fucking head
on her shoulders...
unlike some other parties in this room.
That's some kind of contraption
you got there.
Do you suppose had the inventor
moved among us...
he'd have made a model more
suited to sinkholes?
Guided and pedalled a-right, she'll
roll smooth as a ball on a green.
Yours ain't the fucking hands
or the fucking feet.
So, this is the famous place of death.
At that very table, Mr Blasanov...
- Wild Bill Hickok was shot.
- I've read the account...
perhaps from your hand?
My bicycle...
masters Boardwalk and Quagmire
with aplomb.
Those that doubt me
suck cock by choice.
Does that signal a willingness
to wager?
You're goddamn right,
in specie or fucking currency.
Surely odds must differ between
Quagmire and Boardwalk.
I don't speak of
the Quagmire lengthwise.
Well, shall Quagmire be the Bella
Union gap of the main thoroughfare?
Done.
- 8-to-1 odds on the Quagmire.
- I shall swoop across it.
- 8-to-1 taken to 100.
- Even money on the Boardwalk.
Done! Taken to 100.
Loose boards to be nailed...
commerce suspended,
animals, drunks and sundries...
- cleared from my lane of passage.
- Done.
May I have time to
ready my camera, Tom?
- Get going.
- I'll make fresh plates...
- and a new stop-bath.
- Whatever the fuck that means.
- Come, Mr Blasanov.
- What has just happened?
Those who doubt me
suck cock by choice.
I had time only to make
cold meat sandwiches...
after seeing Mrs Garret.
- Fine.
- Ice-cold cider in the cellar.
I'll get it.
She thought it wonderful that
I should teach the camp's children.
- Good.
- Wonderful.
Poor woman.
Husband killed, left alone.
Any person would have found
her situation sympathetic...
let alone someone of your instincts.
- Mr Nuttall has received a bicycle.
- Has he?
- William was very excited to see it.
- Good.
Your food is ready.
He's out back waiting. William is.
- That's mighty good for business.
- Shut up!
There's a girl sitting by herself
in that whorehouse...
Joanie Stubbs.
Next you see her,
give her my congratulations.
Seeing you know about losing friends...
you might be a good person to go on
and talk to her.
How does standing in my own puke...
prompt you to volunteer me to give
a condolence call?
Why fucking wouldn't it, Jane?
You like being situated how you are?
What fucking friends
did she lose, anyway?
How are Martha and William?
Well.
What would you think of Marcus' lot,
Seth, as location for the bank?
I could see arguments in favour.
He's going back to Bismarck.
Asking $14,000, 10 of which he'd carry
at 1% a month, which I find reasonable.
Obviously, the location's its great virtue.
Under all the circumstances, I disagree.
- Too central?
- Not too central, no.
I'm thinking more the chief backer
might find unpleasant...
- this building being always in her view.
- I see.
Anything further you need explained
chapter and verse?
I hadn't understood the matter
continued so tender.
It ain't tenderness, avoiding provocation.
It's common fucking courtesy.
Which neither of you is showing
fucking much toward me.
It's over.
It's finished!
You've got the worst brother, Mose...
as ugly as he is,
that miserable a disposition.
Mr Manuel, how are you, sir?
Fuck you, Tolliver,
your crooked games...
- and your watered-down liquor.
- Francis Wolcott, Mr Manuel.
- Thank you for coming.
- State your business.
An admirable rigour in manner.
Would you join me, please?
Do I guess rightly, sir, that you and
your brother do not deal happily with...
- groups of men?
- Nor each other.
Yet you have made a rich find
and have done...
- very well in beginning its development.
- State your business.
Further development may require
organisation on a scale and...
dealings with men to which you and
your brother are not suited...
or not disposed to attempt.
With thieving bastard Cornishmen,
you mean?
Underground in the shafts,
high-graders every one of them.
The interests I represent have learned
to deal effectively...
over the years with high-grading
and other forms of theft by employees.
You ain't learned no effective method
when it's my brother going against you.
Against us in what sense?
In all five fucking senses.
More reason you and he might sever...
connections toward taking
separate paths.
I'm sitting here, ain't I?
We would offer $200,000 for
an undivided ownership on your claim.
We'd both have to fucking sell.
I'd presume your brother
has stays and...
encumbrances on your right
to separate sale?
He's encumbered every fucking breath
I've ever fucking taken.
$200,000?
Would it expedite matters if I made
our case to your brother?
I'll make the fucking case,
once I find the saloon he's in.
He should understand that our patience
is not inexhaustible.
- Did I say I thought that?
- No.
- Don't tell me how to talk to my brother!
- Certainly not.
Unless you're trying to
fucking irritate me!
Opposite of my intention.
- $200,000?
- Cash.
- Mrs Garret.
- Why do you linger?
The stages are frequent,
and you're past your stated purpose.
- Have you another?
- Please, Mrs Garret, do come in.
Do you believe I do?
My beliefs about you have to do with
your soul...
which I feel is cold and ungenerous,
unless you are a counterfeit.
And if you are a counterfeit,
the deception comes so naturally...
I'd credit its source in such a soul,
meaning cold and ungenerous...
and as capable of counterfeit,
manipulative and treacherous as well.
Who can you think I am, Mrs Garret?
- I, a poor working girl?
- You are not.
I only hope your high wroth, ma'am,
don't bespeak some affair gone amiss.
I hope to Christ not involving Mr Bullock.
Even under such duress,
you oughtn't presume to strike me.
For who do you take me, then?
For who do you mistake me?
I mistake you for no one, Miss
Isringhausen, and I know you for a fact.
All right then, Mrs Garret.
You've had your fit of temper.
Get the fuck back to your room.
How's his toothache?
I ain't requiring about
his toothache, Richardson.
And you oughtn't be requiring about
his toothache, either.
You ought to be hoping that his nibs
will be sleeping, so...
we can both sneak away
and go watch the ride.
What are you, what are you...
- You stupid...
- Mr Farnum, are you in there?
I need your permission, Mr Farnum.
I'm coming in.
What's killing you?
What's afflicting you?
Stop it!
For God's sake, get away from me!
I put clove-soaked cloth to my tooth.
I must have gagged on it...
- when I was napping.
- Are you saved, sir?
Your filthy hand was down my throat!
May I go out to watch the bicycle?
Watch the earth yielding up its dead,
so long as it's not near me!
And never violate
my private office again!
That cocksucker.
What do you think of that, Chief?
Some kind of fucking division of...
feeling? Yeah?
If I'm overstepping, boss, I apologise.
I'm waiting.
Sometimes I hear you speaking
in here...
when I know there's nobody
in here but you.
You have not yet reached the age,
Dan, have you...
where you're moved to
utterance of thoughts...
- properly kept silent?
- Been known to mutter.
Not the odd mutter.
Habitual fucking vocalising of...
thoughts best kept to yourself.
I will confide further.
Lately...
I talk to this package.
The severed, rotting head...
I paid bounty on last year
of that murdered fucking Indian.
Well, anyways, it's the late shift.
You subscribe one way or another to
Tom Nuttall's big ride?
No. I don't see him making it,
but I didn't want to root agin him.
The Indian got an opinion?
Don't the decapitated
deserve recreation, Chief?
As much, if not more so,
than those of us yet not dismembered.
You, fucking Chief,
are uglier than before...
when you were also
not a treat to the eyes.
Suffer the low vantage.
It's better for my standing in the camp.
That is a lay-down you propose!
Corruption won't never breathe stinky
on my bicycle!
Sent many of your friends to
the happy hunting ground.
Formidable, Tom was, and no more
a fool now than time shows us all.
Using the smallest possible aperture,
Mr Blasanov...
and the fastest shutter speed,
our endeavour is to capture...
Mr Nuttall's attempt
in all its vigour and velocity.
- We got to sell this claim, Charlie.
- Why?
'Cause if we don't,
we're going to fuck it up.
Speak for yourself.
Speaking for myself, if we don't sell,
you're going to fuck it up.
Speak for yourself.
Come on, Tom.
Go on, my son!
He made it, Chief.
My brother had an accident.
- What's his condition now?
- Fatal. Dead.
- Fatal gunshot.
- So, an accident.
Handling his weapon.
A self-inflicted wound.
Fucking stupid, showing off when
he's been fucking drinking.
Or a stupid fucking trick,
more than one fucking time he'd do that.
- For Christ's sake.
- Are there other kin, Mr Manuel?
- There's just us.
- Mother and father dead, no siblings...
- What did I just fucking say to you?
- Do you accept our offer...
as your brother's sole heir and
agent of your own interests?
$200,000.
- Cash upon execution.
- We already executed.
Jane Cannary! Jane Cannary coming in.
- Hello!
- Closed.
I ain't here for any funny business.
My name's Jane Cannary.
You and me got a pain-in-the-balls
mutual acquaintance...
- Charlie fucking Utter.
- How do you do, Jane?
Joanie Stubbs.
Would you like a drink?
Yes! But my opening position is no.
I'm having a drink, Jane.
I'll probably join you directly.
Charlie says you lost your friends.
Yes.
- I don't guess it was plague.
- No.
Fucking violence, probably.
I worked a plague tent last year.
People spoke of the good you did.
Some left the tent upright.
Maybe I will have a fucking drink...
just for sociability's sake
and 'cause I'm a fucking drunk.
Well, what's your preference?
That it ain't been previously swallowed.
Bourbon, if you got it.
Bourbon from Kentucky.
I should certainly fucking hope so.
Thank you.
Murdered? Your friends?
It's best probably not to talk about it.
If we held to that rule, we'd be...
mute like monks
months at a fucking time.
Three of them murdered.
Others shooed from camp
so they wouldn't be.
I heard of a beating
Charlie Utter dispensed to some...
cocksucker yesterday.
I wonder if that's connected.
I wouldn't be surprised.
Yes.
Does he pose a further danger to you,
the cocksucker?
Is that what's got you sitting in the dark?
Sitting count as waiting?
I'll say that's an attitude fit for darkness.
Not knowing what else to say...
or pretending that it ain't familiar.
Anyways, I'm fuck...
I'm pleased to meet you,
pleased to meet you.
- Pleased to meet you, Jane.
- All right.
Thank you for coming by.
Don't you want your drink?
I guess I'll leave it.
Refined spirits will sometimes
convulse me.
- Mr Ellsworth.
- I was hoping for a word.
As many as you'd like.
- Is your purpose clandestine?
- Private, as far as that goes.
Sofia's taking her nap.
Let me get you a better chair.
Would it speak ill of me that
I'm comfortable here?
The other morning, you was...
indisposed.
I regret having imposed
that on your attention.
I had a wife.
Took by typhus, and our baby girl.
- I'm so sorry, Mr Ellsworth.
- Thank you.
Anyways, I'm acquainted with certain...
experiences.
- Throwing up mornings, as an example.
- I see.
And I'd say, not claiming credentials...
for raising a family, as...
my time with them was...
brief.
But I'd hope it'd testify to willingness...
as a candidate for...
marriage, and so forth.
Offering myself.
Completing the sorry presentation.
I'm deeply grateful for your proposal.
May I ask a brief interval before
giving you my answer?
Long as you like.
- It will give me time to get up.
- I'll ask...
a little longer than that,
and some solitude.
Of course.
Thank you very much, Mr Ellsworth.
Yes, ma'am.
- Is the boy warm enough?
- Yes, thank you.
This roof over our heads, Mr Bullock...
testifies to your care for
William and me.
The fostering affection and guidance...
you show my son
to shape him into a man...
will only deepen my gratitude to you.
As for myself...
no further demonstrations
are necessary as...
other duties claim your attentions.
None such as you conceive
since your arrival...
nor will they again,
whatever the state of our relations.
Do not sacrifice further
on my account, Mr Bullock.
I reject the offering. I repudiate it.
I find it poisonous.
Not the eyesore of my previous visit?
Ah, Al, welcome. Yes, yes.
Tidied and reconstituted...
prompted in no small measure,
I might add, by your...
very much appreciated exhortation.
I just jotted a few fucking thoughts
down for your perusal.
In what regard?
Well, peruse it,
and you'll fucking find out.
What the fuck is this?
That is a telegraph apparatus,
whose operator, Mr Blasanov...
presently is taking the air.
"Sheriff Bullock would not confirm
having met with representatives...
"from the Montana territory
to discuss their offer of annexation."
- Is this true, Al?
- Did he fucking confirm it to you?
- I haven't spoken to Bullock.
- So...
then I guess it ain't confirmed.
Answer me this fucking question.
Why in fuck...
do I find out about
this telegraph operator...
arriving tardily and by accident?
I wasn't aware that you were owed
official notification.
Merrick, you and me are allies...
marching into battle together,
and aren't smart-assed...
replies amongst allies
a waste of fucking time?
Allies? Marching?
"Allies? Marching?"
Is exactly fucking right.
And this operator hitting camp is big.
The main dereliction is Farnum's...
whose bailiwick specifically is
new arrivals.
But you have also been fucking remiss.
What battle are we marching toward
in formation of some sort, Al?
I purchased a sleeping equipment.
Mr Blasanov, Mr. Swearengen.
How do you do, Mr Swearengen?
All right, Blasanov. That's some
pronounced fucking accent you've got.
I am Russian.
Now, you could have waited saying that
before I was fucking seated, huh?
Mr Swearengen was
keenly interested to hear...
that you're the camp's
telegraph operator.
- How do you do?
- Oh, no, no, no. How do you do?
You are the master of
the fucking secret code...
and all the other fucking
secret things, isn't that right?
- Not so secret.
- No, that's some fucking skill.
I'm sure people are trying to
bribe you right and left?
- No, no. I'm not allowed.
- Nor am I, no.
None of us are.
We are, every one, strictly forbade.
That's the fucking beauty of it all.
I think I haven't enough
English for you...
- Mr Swearengen.
- Bullshit.
You have the perfect,
exact fucking amount.
My only question for you, young man...
is your feelings on...
your prick being sucked constantly
and without charge, yeah?
And thus you encounter one of
our wonderful meaningless...
American traditions, Mr Blasanov,
the tall-tale conversation...
and tales and good nature.
The Gem, Blasanov...
my saloon. Very convenient to
your place of business?
Via private walkway,
which I will employ as we speak...
or by the public thoroughfare.
Visit, and you will experience
a tradition...
only used in this camp or my place...
by newly-arrived telegraph operators,
fucking free.
Be their preference of tail tall...
or fucking otherwise.
And by all means, welcome to America.
Evening, Bill.
Jane ain't with me, 'cause she's
a drunken fucking mess...
and I don't know what to do about it.
I know you want her looked out for,
and I'm doing my fucking best.
But I won't stand before you
claiming optimism.
Other news...
That letter you wrote your wife just
before that cocksucker murdered you...
it come to my hand.
I won't even try explaining fucking how.
And knowing what we know about
our fucked-up postal system...
I ain't committing it to the fucking mails.
You know I'll try to get it to her...
which I pray be a portion off your mind.
When I've found where she's at...
on my way setting off, I'll tell you.
All right. God bless you, Bill.
And as far as Jane,
as drunk as you've seen her...
you've never seen her this worse.
Between us, maybe having lost...
wanting to keep on.
So I don't know what the fuck to do!
But you know I'll... I'll keep trying.
Is this adequate, Mr Manuel?
Your brother's mortal remains
are housed inside...
under the care of Mr Lee.
- Do you speak Chinese?
- I do not, sir.
However you accomplish
communication...
with that son of a bitch,
then the more the...
disgrace to your soul!
Are we through here?
Can we finally complete
our transaction?
It fucking happens,
the fucking gun he was cleaning...
when he shot himself was mine.
- Is that so?
- And I'm asking to know if a person of...
the mind to blame me will have a way
to recover the fucking bullet?
I expect not, Mr Manuel,
or that other than yours...
any such mind is in the camp.
And suggest you think of other things...
like the money that Mr Tolliver's...
waiting to present to you
at the Bella Union.
That easy! To forget a fucking brother!
