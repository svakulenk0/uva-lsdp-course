In the sweat of thy face
shalt thou eat bread
till thou return
unto the ground.
and unto dust
shalt thou return.
pick this child up
on the healing side.
for the promise
on the other side,
that she might live
and abide with you.
Boy as old man:
When sister died,
there weren't none but women
and old men to bury her.
had gone off to
fight the Civil War.
I know something
about the Civil War.
The story I'm about
to tell is true
We buried sister in
the spring of 1862.
some Yankee bastards
dug her up
and tossed her out
like a rag doll,
on account of Paps
siding with the South.
In these Cumberland
mountains
down near the
Tennessee line,
half the folks sided
with the South.
The other half sided
with the North.
The neighbors turned
against their neighbors,
and it was rough
through here.
Giddyup.
Whoa.
We heard.
We can bury her again.
Israel can stand guard.
We're gonna take her home.
There'll be hell to pay.
So we brung sister
back home to our place
Up at the end of
Meshack Creek.
With the work of
feeding ourselves.
Mama!
Man: Whoa!
Mama, men coming.
Yankees.
They'll steal everything we got.
Will they hurt us?
Maybe not.
Go on! Go on!
Are you Sarah Anders?
I am.
Ma'am, they say your
husband's fighting
against his country.
We have orders to resupply
With contraband
from the enemy.
That means we'll take
forage provisions from you.
We got some hungry boys
down in Cumberland Gap.
I apologize for your hardship.
How many you got
here with you?
How many?
Me and my boy.
Where is he?
Boy, you go stand
by your mother.
Sarah: Come here.
Come here.
Ma'am, I will not hurt you
or your boy,
if you give us no trouble.
All right.
Take no prisoners.
You got a nice place.
I got a piece of bottomland
across the River.
Ohio River.
Brown County, Ohio.
Raise hogs, corn,
sorghum, mostly.
You should stay there.
Ma'am?
Captain?
Uh, there weren't no hams
in the smokehouse.
And there's no cows or pigs
in the stall.
Just cow shit and pig shit.
Well, see what's in there.
Mmm. Bread.
She don't own nigs.
He work like them.
What you think he is fighting for?
Keep us from stealing
his chickens?
That's a good reason.
Shit!
Johnny dog.
Neely, meet the elephant.
Shit...
That a fresh grave?
I'll tell where our cow is.
Well, I've seen all kinds
of hiding places.
She's up there.
Rodie!
Newt!
Captain?
A cow is up there somewheres.
Neely, Chicago, come on up.
Captain, we take the mule?
Uhh...
No.
Ma'am, I apologize for
the things this war makes.
Ugh...
Aah!
Newt!
Oh! Oh, no!
Newt!
I fell off!
I fell off!
I fell off!
Roll him on his side.
Rodie, keep that leg still!
All right, somebody...
Somebody get him
something to bite.
Oh, no! No!
Here, Newt, chew on this.
You all ready?
Oh, no!
Let's get him to the house.
It hurts!
It hurts.
Spin him!
There's a damn dog
under the bed.
Well, I'll kill the sum'bitch!
Captain: Neely,
rip up that pillowcase!
Yes, sir.
Ma'am, you got
some liniment oil?
No.
You got some whisky?
No.
Well, can you boil water?
Get the turpentine
out of the harness shed.
Rodie, get some water.
Neely, light that damn fireplace.
Hold still!
What's she got up there?
A ham and a rifle.
Captain?
Man: All right,
all right, soldier.
All right, all right.
Settle down.
It burns, don't it?
Well...
You want a chew?
No.
Look, he's sweating.
We can't move him
until the fever breaks.
You can sleep in there
if you want to.
I told the men
to sleep in the barn.
I'm gonna keep ahold
of this musket of yours.
I don't like this at all...
Staying here.
We've got plenty to eat.
Yeah...
Maybe them buzzards will, too.
Boy: Is he gonna die?
Like Jesse?
If the skinny Yankee gets well...
he might be the one
shooting at your pap.
You wash your face?
One day...
your pap will come
around up the creek.
Until then, you're
the man around here.
You need to sleep.
Got to bear up.
Captain?
It's me, Rodie.
Damn, Neely.
Captain, the woman's gone.
The woman's gone?
Mm-hmm.
You should try and
get some sleep.
I'll look for her.
Yes, sir.
Elephant...
Elephant.
Who's there?
It's me.
Corporal Neely said
you was gone.
Am I under arrest?
Who's buried here?
Excuse me for asking.
First Yankee that
dies in Altmara,
I'm gonna go down.
And I'm gonna dig up
the son of a bitch.
We buried her in Altmara.
The Yankees living down there
wouldn't abide that...
Her mixed in with their
damn Yankee kin.
Your daughter?
They dug her up.
We brought her back here.
Her pap don't even know.
She smelled so bad.
There'll be hell to pay.
Rodie?
Yeah?
Use the damn outhouse.
Sir?
There's a woman about.
Yes, sir.
It burns like hell, don't it?
Damn, it hurts.
Well, it's supposed to, now.
Is that fresh milk?
He can't keep the
hard stuff down.
Thank you, ma'am.
Whoa, whoa.
Well, the Yankees could
steal what we had.
But not what
we hadn't got yet.
I was young
but I was stout,
and I could handle a mule
as well as any man.
Your reins are too tight.
That's why she's drifting.
Whoa, whoa.
You need three fingers
of slack right here.
I got a matched pair of
sorrel mules back home
That turn on a skinny dollar.
Must be about 10, huh?
That old, huh?
Put some salt in his feed,
And you might get
A couple more crop
years out of her.
Come on, come on!
asked if he could turn
a few rows.
And that morning
was the first
I seen mama wear
her green dress
Captain:
Hyah! Hyah!
How's Newt?
You ain't been in to see him?
Cain't.
Bad luck.
This is not bad luck.
He is not dead.
It's a gut wound.
Ain't nothing you can do.
What's he doing out there?
Captain:
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
He is a widower.
He's, um...
Brushing off the cobwebs.
He ain't much of a soldier.
Whoa, whoa.
Thank you, sir.
Where's your husband fighting?
The army of Tennessee.
Was he at Shiloh?
Yeah.
That was a bad mess.
You was there?
No...
No.
No, we never been
in a big scrape.
"Meet the elephant,"
boys call it.
Ma'am, last night,
What you said about
your little girl.
I'm real sorry.
Sorry don't do nothing.
Don't stop you from
taking our cow or ham,
Killing our chickens.
Well, you have a corn crop.
Some have it worse.
So that's it?
You's out here blistering
up your hands
To make you feel better
about stealing from us?
If I was you,
I'd take advantage.
These blisters can't
hold out much longer.
Captain: Come on.
Ahem.
What?
Hell, Neely, they were
starting to smell.
Go ahead. Smell.
You can't leave dead chickens
in a rucksack for 2 days!
Corporal!
Uh...
Uh, captain?
Corporal.
Them chickens are
starting to smell.
Well, pluck 'em.
Uh, pluck 'em, sir?
How do you do this?
- I ain't.
- I might.
They say you cannot know who does
and who don't. It will surprise you.
You ain't running from
the elephant, are you?
Me?
Yeah, you.
No.
You get shot a lot easier
showing them your backside.
And you know something
about this?
I joined up to fight.
No...
No, I ain't running.
Yeah, I know
something about it.
Rodie, we ain't soldiers.
We are chicken thieves.
You kiss my brown spot.
I joined up to fight.
My brother saw action.
Wildcat, mule springs, Shiloh.
He said you become a new man,
with your first shot.
Dead and dying...
hardly get a passing thought.
Become cool and deliberate.
Captain!
Corporal?
You hear it?
Hear what?
Gunfire.
Whoa, whoa. What?
There was shooting
from over there.
Squirrel hunters most likely.
Go ride over and find out.
Ride over?
Might run straight up
to an ambush.
I'm in charge.
Neely, only reason
you got that stripe
is you too bold-ass dumb
to think for yourself.
Are you a general?
General, huh?
No, just a captain.
How many men you killed?
You really want to know?
None.
Rodie?
What?
You feel cool and deliberate?
Nothing's moving.
Damn.
We should...
We should bury them.
We'd have to hang
around to do that.
You want to hang around?
Hyah!
Want a chew?
Thank you.
Captain.
There was a farm burnt down.
Some old man and
his wife were killed.
Where?
There.
No more than 5 Miles up the creek.
You know whose place it is?
Yankees.
Ma'am, they weren't Yankees.
Just some old farmer
and his wife.
They sent two boys
into the Union army.
They were just farmers.
Like I said, the war
was rough through here.
How'd you sleep?
You're going to be fine, soldier.
Uh, how's Newt?
We're out of turpentine.
Captain, what do we do?
Oh...
I don't know.
We need to feed the boys
back at the Cumberland Gap.
And that old farmer
and his wife.
We should report back
that there's some
guerrilla outfit
running around killing Unionists.
I think we got to wait Newt out.
He's too sick to ride.
We could hitch up the wagon
to the mule,
haul Newt out.
Giddyup, giddyup.
I won't let that
woman and boy
root hog or starve.
No. No, sir.
Whoa.
Will you let me do that?
I don't need your help.
Well, I like working with mules.
How's your hands?
Blisters on top of blisters.
Let me see.
Let me see.
All right.
That's fine. Thank you.
Come on!
I told you I got you.
I told you.
Captain, Newt took a poop.
I guess that's a good sign.
Rodie, make sure
you clean up this porch.
My stomach hurts.
Worse than yesterday?
Mm-mmm.
Oh, you'll be fine.
You're not as hot.
How's he doing?
He's fine.
I'll make you some
sassafras tea.
She's pretty.
You are feeling better.
Ohh...
Hey, Johnny, I'm sorry.
You crossed my artillery line there.
Here, I'll let you spit back.
Go ahead.
You're scaring the boy.
No, he ain't scared.
Are you, Johnny?
Go ahead...
Spit.
Neely: Rodie,
you got a mean streak.
Cool and deliberate.
Captain?
Neely.
Uh, chicken's cooked.
Yes, yes.
I told you it was going
to get burnt.
Pow...
Pow.
Chicago: You are looking
rather well this evening.
Leave him alone!
Go to hell.
Chicago: Rodie!
Hey, hey, hey!
Is she crazy, captain?
Bastard!
Rodie hit her dog.
That damn Johnny dog
ate my food, captain.
Soldier, I want you
to apologize.
I'm telling you, captain,
that woman is crazy.
If you want another plate,
you'll apologize.
She hit me with
a damn bucket!
Common decency tells you
you don't pick up a woman
and throw her against a wall!
Private, you're dismissed!
Sir!
Hope you get a piece.
What'd you say, soldier?
Rodie, shut up.
Spent your whole damn day, what?
Plowing her corn.
You cut her wood.
I'm sure she thinks you're
a damn good samaritan.
You know what I think?
I think you just want
a little poke.
Rodie!
Rodie, stop it!
Come on, Rodie!
Rodie!
I hope you kills each other.
You rot in hell.
You rot in hell!
Come here.
Come here.
We can't just sit by.
I want you to go tonight,
to preacher's house.
And tell him that
there's Yankees here,
and he should get word
to our people.
Don't talk to anyone
but preacher.
And you have to be back
before sunup.
- You understand me?
- Yes, ma'am.
These are yours.
Go on.
And I'm sorry.
There was some...
ugly things said tonight about...
They weren't true.
No?
Don't think they were true.
Your little girl died, and...
Well, my wife died
I miss her.
Miss my farm, my boy.
I come here to your place,
and it looks a lot
like my place...
We ain't gonna be friends.
Let's just keep
to being enemies.
Yes, ma'am.
I forgot.
You have a better memory.
Ahem...
Is Newt asleep?
Yeah.
You know,
I don't think Rodie
mean to be disrespecting.
His brother was killed
by a rebel sniper.
He get crazy thinking
about it. He's...
Where are you from?
Chicago.
No, I mean before that.
This small village in Poland.
It's just very small.
You damn foreigner.
Why get mixed up in this?
I think I get to see new places,
I get tired of chopping sausage.
Pretty thin reason
to get shot at.
You got a better one?
I've heard your big reasons.
To save the union.
This is what the generals say.
To free the slaves?
Nobody that I know
want to get killed
to free a bunch of nigs.
It's a mess, ain't it?
Why did you...
Sign up?
Minister.
Brought a runaway slave
into our church
and ripped off his shirt.
Showed off the ugliest
damn strap scars.
Right there from the pulpit,
the minister asked
for volunteers,
and I stood up,
and here I am...
Stealing chickens.
Hold on!
Preacher:
Who's there, Israel?
It's Miss Anders' boy.
They came up the creek on horses.
How many Yankees is there?
Which?
One's hurt real bad.
Pharaoh sent his army
to smite Israel.
And they drowned
in the Red Sea.
It was wrong what they
done to your sister.
God's will is a powerful thing.
Mama, mama.
Where's your shoes?
What did preacher say?
What?
That's it's going to be all right.
Is he going to get word
to our people?
To your pap?
I think so.
Don't be so thick.
What did he say?
I can't understand him.
Rodie, you can get shot
for desertion.
You ain't gonna do it.
What makes you so sure?
Because...
You ain't sure.
You ain't no killer.
They wouldn't send
no fighting man
To rob widows and orphans.
You can't even do that.
Rodie?
If you desert...
I'll kill you.
Got to go, captain.
Rodie.
Rodie!
Stop!
Shit! A sniper!
God dang it, get down!
Get inside, get inside!
Come on!
Go, go!
What is it?
Newt, keep your head down!
It's a damn sniper.
Is it pap?
I don't know.
Just keep still.
Captain: What the hell
are you all shooting at?
We can't see the
sons of bitches!
It's the elephant.
It is.
It's just a damn sniper.
I believe he's up on that hill.
Anybody here hurt?
You know who's up there?
You know who's out there?
Pap.
You need to say something?
You think Rodie's dead?
I don't know.
Captain?
What are we going to do?
You's all as good as dead.
It's time to meet the elephant.
I'll need one of you...
to keep a gun on these... Rebs.
And I need the other
to cause a faint.
Faint...
What is?
It's a decoy to draw
the enemy's fire.
Chicago, I think you
better do the decoy.
Here.
Yes, sir, captain.
You shoot them if
they try to run for it.
Shoot?
Ready...
Go, go!
Get on!
Get out!
Hold it!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
What the hell?
Chicago: It's a nig.
Neely: Shooting
for the wrong side.
# When the reaping
is done #
# And the harvest
is o'er #
# At the feet of the son
# We will labor no more
# Serving faithfully...
You killed my boy.
And he killed
a federal soldier.
You'll burn in hell
for your sins.
Then I guess
we'll meet again.
Next time don't
send your boy.
Fight your own fights,
you rebel bastard.
# When the reaping
is done #
We ought to string up
that damn rebel preacher.
# And the harvest
is o'er #
# At the feet of the son
# We will labor no more
# Serving faithfully
You get that wagon
and mule ready.
We're hauling Newt
out of here.
# What a Joy it will be
# When the reaping
is done #
Hey!
You can't take
our mule.
Oh, get him away from her!
Get him away!
Stop it.
Get him away!
Stop bein' so damn stubborn!
All right?
They're dead!
They're dead!
You son of a bitch!
You hear me?
You stop that!
Boy...
Get away from me!
Boy, you get!
There'll be hell to pay.
Yeah, you said that before.
Go on in there.
Make sure she don't
strangle Newt.
Yes, sir, captain.
Hitch up that mule,
bring the wagon around.
Yes, sir.
We're getting
out of here, Newt.
I'm gonna miss the dog.
Shit...
Ahh!
Sorry, Newt.
Captain, we are ready.
Should we say some words?
You say it for yourself.
Bye, Rodie.
Giddyup!
What do you expect us to eat?
Ma'am.
I says, what do you
expect us to eat?
Ma'am, that husband of yours...
Why don't you
bring him home?
We'll all eat good.
I'm leaving your rifle.
Maybe the boy can
shoot squirrels.
Ma'am, I took your powder.
Let's go.
I thought she was
sweet on him.
No, you can't trust johnnies.
Come on, mule.
Whoa, shit!
What the hell happened?
I want you both to stay here.
Yes, sir.
What's he doing?
I think he's wanting
to kill somebody.
Ohh!
What'd you do?
What'd you do?
I shot.
Shot what?
I heard shooting.
I shot a Yankee.
Do they know it was you?
Do they?
I don't know.
Come on! Come on!
Sarah Anders!
Did you forget something?
Newt was shot about
a mile down the creek.
- You know anything about it?
- No.
Where's your boy?
I sent him up the spring.
Boy! Come here!
Your pants are wet.
I was up at the spring.
He was up at the spring.
Come here, boy.
Come here!
Now, did you kill Newt?
You look at him.
Did you kill Newt?
Your mother might tell you that
it's all right to kill Yankees.
But I just want you to know
that that boy...
He had a brother just like you.
And he had a family just like you!
And he never hurt a fly in his life!
And he wouldn't be dead If you hadn't
come down here stealing from us!
We was doing fine until
you showed up.
Don't blame it on...
Go ahead...
Kill us.
You know it scares me.
'cause I could.
I really could.
I just hope whoever
killed Newt...
Has the common decency
to give him a Christian burial.
What'd you do to them?
You heard the shots.
Damn...
Get that damn Yankee
out of our yard.
The captain asked us
to do the decent thing.
I don't guess the Civil War
was about being decent.
We dug up
the big redhead
and floated him down
Meshack Creek.
Ma said he come up that creek
to cause trouble,
and we sent him back down
where he come from.
We drug the skinny
Yankee up a hill
Where a big sycamore tree
had fallen over
We throwed the skinny Yankee
in the sinkhole,
I don't guess Ma hated
the skinny Yankee
Ma told me to never
never tell anyone
Except maybe once,
or maybe twice.
