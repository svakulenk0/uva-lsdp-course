My name is Red Doc and I can whip any men
in the house and ride any filly in the place.
Give me a fresh bottle,
the good stuff
and don't keep a tip
I don't like you.
Big Boy. I am Madame Lorraine.
I'm ready to see you got the guts.
But it will cost you.
On a horseback hanging from my chandelier
you name it!
I hope your aim improves.
You think I'm too drunk, don't you honey?
Come over here and sit by me.
I'll show you what I can do.
Let's make it comfy first.
Get rid of him. And make sure noone sees you.
Like always boss.
- I know who you are. You are the Jonah Hex.
- Congratulations.
I can shoot six bottles off
a fence and not miss a one.
Who gives a damn?
I could take it!
- seen him?
- Can't say that I have.
Are you sure?
A-Ha
Put a drink on the bar and go away.
- I have seen him.
- Talk.
I'll help you. Will you help me?
What kind of help? Enough money to leave town.
Got me a little paper round.
Madame Lorraine, she picks the well-heeled ones
they go upstairs...
...they are never seen again.
Take your reward.
Hey bartender...
Set up the house.
Hey, cowboy. How would you like to trade
that drink for some real fun water upstairs?
- You ask me because I'm so handsome?
- Cos I think you can afford a good time.
- How about we both get comfortable?
- I'm looking for a dead man named Red.
Oh, a dead man!
Now Why would I know anything about a dead man?
- You wouldn't hit a lady?
- You ain't no lady.
Drinks are on the house.
- You hit me.
- Hard as I could.
Only gonna ask this once:
Where is Red?
He's gonna be a little wraith.
Oh man,
You and your rats smart bussiness, ain't you?
Wait! We could be partners.
I don't mind splitting the take.
- You can't leave me here alone!
- You ain't alone. You got plenty of company ...
... And you know hell everybody there.
