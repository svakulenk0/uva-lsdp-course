- Hi.
- Morning, Molly.
I just saw Dingo Brion riding into town,
looking meaner than ever.
Thought you'd like to know.
- Morning, Marshal.
- Morning.
And how is the flower of the West
this morning?
Gone to seed.
- Calem Ware, you didn't sleep again.
- I slept fine.
Then what's troubling you this morning?
How do you make yourself
so fresh and beautiful this early morning?
It's glasses you need, my bucko.
You like some ham and eggs now?
You don't eat right or regular.
- You look after me like a mother hen.
- Old hen.
Now who is it this time?
Dingo Brion.
He rode into town this morning
with blood in his eye.
Hiram Hays run over
from the livery stable to tell me.
Will you marry me, Molly?
How can you joke when you know
he said he was coming back to kill you?
- The snarling beast.
- What?
Can't you hear it,
growling out there? Listen.
This town is like
a wild animal in chains, Molly.
It doesn't fight back right away.
It just lies there and snarls,
waiting for a chance to pounce on you.
- You hear that?
- Everyday.
- Be careful, Calem.
- What's for lunch?
- Cabbage and mutton.
- Then I'll be in for a double order.
It's not me you love, but my cooking.
Right you are, Molly.
But you know what they say?
A man's stomach had more sense in it
than either his heart or his head.
- Morning Calem.
- Marshal.
Marshal.
- Morning, Asaph. Mrs. Dean.
- Will you be in your office later, Calem?
- As soon as I have a shave.
- I'll be by.
I don't want to waste a lot of time
in town today.
I said I don't want to waste
a lot of time in town today.
No, of course not.
Your wife might enjoy herself a little.
Now, Cora, let's not go into that.
As soon as I get my business finished,
we're going back to the ranch.
Yes, dear.
- Good morning, Mr. Thorne.
- Good morning, Mrs. Dean.
My! How lovely you've done it over.
Mr. Dean and I are so looking forward
to seeing the young lady.
Cora, you fool.
Why haven't I seen you?
It's been two weeks.
I've been busy.
There's been no time or way. I...
You want everyone to see us together?
You used to find time and ways.
You're very clever at inventing ways.
Yes, Mrs. Dean. The remodeling
of the opera house has made it...
the finest little theatre west of Chicago.
I assure you, there will be two tickets
at the box office tonight...
for you and your husband.
- Morning, Marshal.
- Morning.
Morning, Juan. Morning, Cody.
Quite a looker, isn't she?
- Is she? I hadn't noticed.
- Thorne's noticed.
Leave it to Thorne to get the best.
A man's tongue works
like a shovel sometimes, Cody.
- It can dig his own grave.
- So I've been told.
- He's back, you know.
- Who?
- Dingo Brion.
- Is that so?
Says he's gonna put a slug
through that badge of yours by night.
- But I'm laying bets six to five he can't do it.
- Only that much?
Odds are getting shorter, Calem, each time.
- You worried?
- Not at six to five.
It's only long shots that worry gamblers.
Can I buy you a drink?
- Maybe later.
- Anytime.
Theatrical troupe arriving.
Welcome.
- Welcome to Medicine Bend.
- A whistle stop.
- I'm Thorne. You must be...
- I'm Mr. Willis. I'm the stage manager.
I'm glad to know you.
Your trunks have already arrived.
And I've make arrangements
for everyone at the hotel.
I may as well be frank with you, Mr. Thorne.
I opposed this small town from the first.
We'll do everything we can
to make you comfortable.
It's Miss Dickinson's idea
that we play Medicine Bend, not mine.
Tally!
- The beautiful Taleen.
- Hello, Thorne.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Miss Taleen Dickinson...
a star of great renown,
fresh from her triumphs in Chicago...
and all points West.
She comes to grace our theatre.
And I hope our town, permanently.
Because in front of all you nice people...
and for the 10th time...
I'm asking the lovely
Miss Dickinson to be my bride.
- Please, Thorne, I'm very tired.
- Yes, of course.
Thorne, aren't you going to
introduce me to the lady?
I've never met a great star before.
Marshal.
Miss Dickinson, our marshal, Calem Ware.
How do you do, Marshal?
You did say "Miss Dickinson"?
A stage name, Marshal.
Our marshal has been a peace officer
in many tough towns in the West.
- Dodge City, Abilene, Apache Wells.
- She wouldn't know Apache Wells.
That's a rough, dirty, untamed spot.
A place to forget.
But I do remember Apache Wells.
I mean, I do know the marshal's gun
has quite a reputation.
I manage somehow to keep alive.
- Perhaps till now.
- Till now?
He's betting with his friend,
but don't let him tell you any fairytales.
You'll love it here, Tally.
I'll make you love it and you'll want to stay.
You'll never want to go back
to San Francisco.
I wish you hadn't said what you did
about us in front of all your homefolks.
- But in Chicago you said that...
- I said I'd think about it.
Let me show you to your dressing room.
Lilly Langtry never had better.
- Morning, Tony.
- Howdy, Mr. Marshal.
A fine morning.
They always start out fine
until you wake up and get out of bed.
I heard some miners had another fight
in the south-end last night.
They don't open up the mines
pretty soon, there'll be...
No more talk, Tony.
I'll have the silent treatment this morning.
I'm shut.
Dingo! No!
Go over to Doc Wynn's
and tell him what happened.
Doc, the marshal just killed Dingo.
Hold off.
I never knew you packed a derringer, Calem.
Lots of things you don't know, Cody. Men!
Cody Clark's buying drinks.
He won all the bets.
That's right, drinks are on the house.
Everybody welcome.
Also, take up a collection to bury Dingo.
Add this to it.
That's right nice of you, Calem.
Funny how a man softens to another
when once he's killed him.
I don't know about that.
I'd do as much if it were your funeral.
I think you would. The feeling is mutual.
The odds are getting shorter, Calem.
Next time it'll be even money.
- You want that drink now?
- You drink it.
I never had any doubts
you would beat him, Calem.
Yes, sir, you're doing a job. A great job.
I've lived the greater part
of my life in Colorado.
When the mines didn't pan out, I drove
herds of longhorns north from Texas.
Started out a big cattle business.
We've built a great country.
Now I've only one dream left.
I want to live long enough
to see our territory become a state.
- It will be a state, Asaph.
- We've tried for 12 Years.
A measure to enter the Union
was vetoed twice.
And the bill will never be passed
until conditions...
like we've had in Medicine Bend
are completely corrected.
I'm not as rough and tough as I once was,
but if there's ever any way I can help...
You know what happens
when you put a lid on a boiling pot?
- It either boils over or it explodes.
- Unless you put the fire out under it.
- I guess we should pray for rain?
- You're storm enough, Calem.
You're putting out the fire and I'm grateful.
Calem...
I brought over what worldly effects
Dingo Brion had on him.
- Howdy, Asaph.
- Morning, Doc.
And look what else I found on him.
Five double eagles!
Dingo never had six-bits to jingle
in his pocket his whole miserable life.
- Where would he get $100?
- Probably stole them.
You can figure better than that.
I'd say someone wants you dead.
Enough to pay in advance for it.
It seems the evidence
supports Doc's theory.
That means somebody stands to profit
with you out of the way.
- Who? And for what reason?
- I never was much good at guessing.
If there's anything I can do.
They're all alike.
Hire a man to fight their battles,
then call it their town.
He has his own problems.
I sent out word to Dingo's wife and brother.
They'll be calling here
for him and his things.
Thanks, Doc.
- I guess, there's no use talking to you again.
- Probably not.
- Why don't you walk out, Calem?
- Where'd I go? lt'd be the same anywhere.
- My name's a hard one.
- You could change it.
No, I have got just one chance,
only one, to outlast the times.
- And I'm gambling I'll live to see it.
- You're fooling yourself, Calem.
Duty is one thing
and self-preservation is another.
You walk the streets a living legend...
yet all the time you're afraid
men will know you're human.
Cody knows it.
He knows that someday
something will fail you inside.
Call it what you will.
The urge to kill, fighting heart,
survival instinct...
or just guts.
When that happens...
Do you suppose
I haven't thought of that, Doc?
Do you think I sleep at night?
Don't you think I know
Dingo was a married man, had three kids?
He wasn't much good,
but that doesn't make it any easier for me.
And no matter how hard it was this time,
the next time it'll be worse.
Each time it gets harder.
Think it over, Calem.
It's Dooley Brion and Dingo's widow.
What a monster of a man.
He got that scar on his face from a cougar.
You know how he got even?
He killed that cougar
with his own bare hands.
Don't rile him, Calem.
- You killed my brother.
- Dooley, I'm not fooling with you.
Did you come here
to make trouble like Dingo?
No, I want no trouble.
Dooley, what happened
was Dingo's own fault.
You can pick up his body down at my office.
- The marshal has his things.
- Here.
- Guns. Stinking man-killing guns.
- Stop it, Dooley. It's over, Dooley.
Get in. Let's get Dingo
and go back to the ranch.
This money was Dingo's. He was carrying it.
I reckon you're feeling sorry for me,
Mr. Ware. You shouldn't.
I know Dingo was no good.
He was never no good.
But he was all I had.
Now that's he's gone,
I reckon I'll be better off without him.
It ain't Dingo and it sure ain't me
folks should feel sorry for.
It's you, Calem Ware. You that killed him.
You're the one folks should feel sorry for.
At least Dingo's at peace.
You never will be.
- Get in, Dooley.
- Give me that money.
- No. We need it.
- It's dirty money.
You know Dingo never earned
$100 in his whole life.
Marshal, I ain't holding no grudge.
But I'm telling you, keep away from me.
I don't hold with guns,
but there ain't a gun made...
can stop me before I can get my hands
on the men holding it.
So leave me be.
Doc, give these to Cody Clark
to put with Dingo's funeral collection.
Sure thing. What are you gonna do now?
For the first time in days,
I'm going to have some peaceful sleep.
A sell-out. Biggest thing ever to hit town.
Are you sure it's the show...
or that they're curious to see that lady actor
you announced you were gonna marry?
I hadn't thought about it
but it doesn't sound like a very bad idea.
Wait till you see her on the stage.
Real class.
Calem.
- Hello, Tally.
- You got my note?
I sort of hoped that you might
come to see me on your own.
What do you expect, Tally,
bands and bugles after nine years?
- Did you think it was easy for me?
- I don't know, was it?
Forgetting Apache Wells?
When we met,
you knew I was a peace officer...
that I was going to be
the marshal at Apache Wells.
Yes, you told me that.
I didn't know what it was like...
for a man to make his living by his gun,
walking the streets, a living target.
I died a little more each day
and I died more at night.
I think it's best we both forget.
Apache Wells?
Every time I hear those words
I get sick inside. Sick.
I can see that whole terrible thing.
That dirty little street,
the shootings every night, the killings.
That's what you saw.
When I think of Apache Wells...
I see a beautiful woman.
She loved a man, she said,
but she ran away.
I tried, Calem. I tried.
But that last night when the bullet hit you,
it was as if it hit me here inside.
I wanted to go to you, I wanted to.
Then I saw your face.
I didn't know you, you weren't human,
crawling about there in the dirt...
like some kind of an animal,
shooting until you killed.
Tally, stop it.
- Cora, you didn't tell her about us?
- No.
I knew you wouldn't.
I was deeply hurt when I learned
you wanted to marry her...
but now I don't think I have to worry.
Of course not.
Nothing is going to change between us.
I was going to tell her.
But Marshal Ware changed my mind.
Do you remember when you dropped it?
And the minister had to get on his hands
and knees to find it.
- You still wear it.
- I never could get you out of my mind.
I went back to work, I tried to.
- That's past. You're back.
- I wonder.
Thorne?
He doesn't know yet that we're married.
- I'm going to tell him.
- Then you've decided?
I wanted to see you once more to be sure.
I thought it was gonna be
so easy to tell you, Calem, but it isn't.
- Seeing you, talking to you, I'm not sure.
- You know I'm still in love with you.
- That's the way it's always been.
- But there must be other women, Calem.
Not for me.
I'm so confused.
- Tally, l...
- Look, Calem, I've got another show to do.
Good night, Tally.
So, here you are.
You'd better get over
to the new frontier in a hurry.
Dooley Brion's gone crazy wild.
I heard he's about killed Cody Clark,
and he's wrecking the whole place.
Let's go, Calem.
Dooley. Stop it, Dooley!
Why don't you try your hand
at stopping me?
- What's got into you?
- Him.
He came out to our farm
with all that dirty money, that's what.
I took the collection money
out to Dingo's wife like you asked, Calem.
When I gave it to her,
this moose blew his cork.
I had to put a gun on him to get away.
Later he comes roaring in here.
You can see what he's done...
I should have known it was all your doings.
I warned you to leave me be.
That's far enough, Dooley.
I told you before you couldn't stop me...
before I could lay my hands on you,
Calem Ware.
Now we'll see.
Two to one on Dooley.
Stand up to me, Calem Ware,
stand up to me now or I'll break your back.
Now I'll break you in two.
Even money.
You two men,
take him to the jail and lock him up.
I knew you'd want to make it alone this far.
Still keep them thinking you're not human.
From now on, I'm taking over.
Harley Baskam.
- And what did it sound like this morning?
- The beast? Still growling, Molly.
- Loud?
- Loud and angry.
I thought maybe with Dingo Brion gone,
it'd be over.
When one man goes down,
there's always another itching...
to take his place.
Somebody else so soon? Who is it now?
- Somebody I haven't seen in a long time.
- Calem, you can't.
- With your hurt hand you won't...
- What's for lunch today, Molly?
- Pot roast and potato pancakes.
- I'll just have to marry you now.
I know, "the way to a man's heart
is through his stomach."
Now, get out of here.
- $5,000.
- $5,000!
- We want him out of the way, don't we?
- Yeah, but...
I didn't expect you boys
to make such an offer.
You're not complaining
we've offered too much?
- You know I am.
- I don't get you.
Let's put it this way. I don't get you boys.
It's a lot of money,
even for Calem Ware's scalp.
- Why do you want him so bad?
- He's in our way.
He? What about the other people
around here?
Half the people in this town
are too yellow to fight back...
- and the other half look to me for a living.
- I can understand that.
- But why just one man?
- This has to be our town.
What's stopping you?
You're a big man, Mr. Thorne.
There's one bigger.
There's a cattleman named Asaph Dean.
He's the big power in this community.
He made this town, made the good rules...
and brought in Calem Ware
to see everybody lives by them.
Gentlemen, I don't move a finger
until I know some more.
- There's no reason not to tell you, I guess.
- That's friendly all the way around.
There's gonna be a boom in this town.
- What kind of boom?
- The mines.
I thought the mines were shut down here
because of no smelter.
There's gonna be
a smelter built here, a big one.
Thorne heard about it confidential.
That means the ore won't
have to be shipped hundreds of miles.
That means the mines open up.
Payoff again. And big.
The miners go back to work,
big times for all.
You cutting in on every place in town.
Sounds exciting.
I'll do it...
for one-third.
One-third?
We're not cutting you in.
You're only a hired gun.
The fastest you've ever met.
And don't call me that again.
Don't rush yourselves, gentlemen.
I'll be around until you come up
with the right answer.
And the right answer's one-third.
Next time don't offer
more than the going rate.
Aren't you smart.
Offering him $5,000,
making him ask questions.
Because you've got to be bigger
and better than everybody else.
- Shut up.
- That's your trouble.
Always got to do everything
in a big way, your way.
Always reaching out
for something you can't have.
- I can get anything I go after.
- It isn't just for money, either.
You got to make your pride feel good.
Like with Asaph Dean.
Up to now, the only way
you could figure to hurt him...
was in going after his wife.
Now you got another way,
you dump her for that singer.
Always the biggest and the best.
So you can brag.
One of these days your high conceit's
gonna trip you up for good.
You let me worry about that.
We're partners. What trips you, trips me.
Howdy, Calem, I've been waiting for you.
So is Mrs. Brion.
Dingo, and now Dooley.
Dingo was no good, but Dooley...
there ain't really nothing bad
or mean about him.
It's just that he's so big
he ain't never been treated like a human...
and he don't understand people.
But he's good. God knows he's good.
- He tried to kill me.
- I know.
I said yesterday
it wasn't Dingo I was sorry for, it was you.
- Sit down, Mrs. Brion.
- I ain't finished yet.
Dooley had his licking, plain and proper...
and that's the first time it ever happened.
You didn't shoot him down like a mad dog.
You stood up to him
like you would to any other man...
and Dooley knows it.
He'll never come after you again.
I swear to that.
And I'm asking you to let him go.
I'm begging you.
Dooley.
You can go home.
Dooley, I want you to know
why I'm letting you go.
It's for the sake of Dingo's widow.
She went begging for you. You hear that?
That should make you feel proud, Dooley.
She's all alone. Now, she's scared.
She needs a strong man's help.
You're going to be that man.
You understand?
I'll do right.
- The marshal's letting Dooley go.
- Why shouldn't he?
You would have fought the marshal, too,
if he'd killed your brother.
I guess another killing
for the marshal ain't nothing new.
Lord, give them the breaks
they never had before.
Amen.
Look out!
Why didn't you get him?
A man talks well if he's alive.
Patron, I have failed.
The life of  Ware is blessed.
My knife only missed him by inches.
What are you talking about?
I hear from behind the door...
when you give Dingo Brion
five pieces of gold to kill Ware...
and I think you do same thing for me.
Patron, you must hide me.
- Calem saw you?
You stupid fool.
You shot straight, Cody. He's dead.
Now, that's one you owe me, Calem.
Juan was screaming
how he tried to knife you.
It was the only way
I could stop him from trying again.
- What would Juan have against me, Cody?
- I wouldn't know. Would you?
Too bad. We might have
both been interested.
Couple of you boys
give me a hand here, will you?
Can I make reservations
on the first stage East?
Are you leaving us, Miss Dickinson?
Something wrong?
Please, I want to leave tomorrow,
if possible.
No stage tomorrow.
Next stage out is on Sunday.
Sunday then.
- Who is it?
- Calem.
Come in.
Tally.
Don't try to talk me out of leaving.
- But last night you said...
- Yes, that was last night.
- But today, it'll never be any different.
- Perhaps you can't see it.
Times are changing.
Things will be different.
Perhaps, but it's too late for us.
- No, Tally.
- Please, Calem, it's useless.
There's no going back for either one of us.
I'm going to Chicago,
I'll get a divorce quietly.
Is it Thorne?
I don't know.
I haven't decided yet.
If I married him,
I'd have to live here, close to you.
I couldn't help seeing you,
hearing about you.
I'm sorry it had to end this way, Calem.
I wanted to give you this.
I've kept it all these years.
I feel I have no right to keep it any longer.
Goodbye, Calem.
No need to get your blood
in a boil, Mr. Thorne...
just 'cause a man pays a call
on his own wife.
- His wife?
- News to you?
lmagine a smart operator like you
missing out on a little fact like that.
They've been hitched for a long time,
ever since he was Marshal of Apache Wells.
And you figuring to outrank Ware
in the lady's affections.
You've got your deal.
The cut you want. What are you waiting for?
Till the sun goes down, Mr. Thorne.
Listen...
it's none of my business
to be butting into your private affairs...
- I have no private affairs, Doc.
- How's your public affairs?
Juan worked for Cody.
That doesn't prove anything.
I don't know what you're tying to prove.
Why don't you walk out, Calem?
No one will blame you.
- A meal fit for a condemned man, Molly.
- Don't talk like that, not tonight.
- I guess it wasn't very funny.
- Yeah, I guess it wasn't.
A man rode into town this morning.
By invitation.
- A stranger?
- To you, not to me. Name's Harley Baskam.
Baskam? Sure.
He used to be tied in with Ben Wryson
and the bunch down at San Antone...
until Wryson got three bullets in him.
I know, Doc, I put them there.
Baskam swore he'd never forget it.
I guess it's time to make my evening rounds.
Here, try this liniment.
- You want me to drink that, Molly?
- I didn't say to drink it.
Give me your hand, takes out the stiffness.
- That's what you said, Doc.
- Try it on him.
Calem Ware.
Come on, put up your money.
I'll take any bet you want.
I'll lay you any bet you want.
Any bet.
- Two to one.
- What do you mean?
Calem Ware can clear leather faster
than any man in this part of the country.
"In this part of the country."
But there's a man here tonight
from another part of the country.
Cody, you're drunk.
I'm drunk. I'm celebrating in advance.
Two to one, I said.
Two to one in favor of Harley Baskam.
Baskam?
He's in town?
Harley Baskam from San Antone?
Like I said, two to one.
Do you know why Baskam's here?
He came to pay his last respects
to Calem Ware.
- They tell me you're a friend of Calem Ware.
- I am.
Then go tell him
he's got another friend waiting for him...
an old friend.
You look like a brave man, you tell him.
I said, go fetch Calem Ware.
Hello, Baskam.
- I see you remember me, Calem.
- I remember you.
- Like you remember Ben Wryson, maybe?
- Like that.
I've been looking for you all this time.
- I heard.
- Is that why you ran out?
There's a law in Medicine Bend, Baskam,
against packing guns on the street.
You don't say.
I'm taking your gun, Baskam.
- No man takes my gun.
- Then use it.
Get away from him, old man.
You do it and I'll drop you, so help me.
He's dead, what more do you want?
You got nerve.
- All right, your town's wide open.
- Yeah.
Drinks are on the house, everybody!
Dooley, give me a hand.
- Doc, look, he isn't...
- Get him out of here, quick.
Now we'll let them hear it.
Let them hear it.
- All right, folks! It's wide open!
- Yeah!
Yeah, the marshal's dead!
No, sir...
there'll be no drinking
to the death of Calem Ware in my saloon.
You don't seem to get the drift.
This isn't your saloon anymore.
But you just can't rob me of my business.
No one's robbing you,
we're just buying you out.
Sign it.
- There's nothing on this paper.
- We'll fill it in later. Sign it now.
You see, you're through
in Medicine Bend, Abe.
You and everyone else
who supported Calem Ware.
All right.
I'll sign it.
You all saw that. Abe drew first.
We were only trying to buy him out.
All right, serve them up.
Rest of the night, boys, drinks are
on the house in every saloon in town.
Now, hold it.
Now, we're not drinking
to the death of Calem Ware.
It's unfortunate that he got it,
even though he didn't understand.
But tomorrow you're all going to have
gold in your pockets.
The mines are opening up again.
So drink up.
Number two. Who's next?
Yeah. Anything you say, gents.
Drink up, everybody, the town's wide open.
Come on in!
Come on! Drinks for everyone!
Tomorrow the mines open!
Tomorrow everyone has money
in his pocket!
Don't be afraid to have fun.
There's no one around
to cramp your style. Come on.
The mayor and some of the town council.
In the name of heaven, Thorne...
help us stop this mob
before it gets out of hand completely.
You can see for yourself, Mr. Mayor,
what the situation is without a peace officer.
At the town council meeting on Sunday,
appoint Mr. Baskam marshal.
- There goes the end of the opposition.
- Not all of it.
The big trouble-maker's still left...
and I want the pleasure
of talking to Mr. Asaph Dean myself.
Dead or alive?
Drop the gun, Asaph.
See, this is just a social call.
Condolences, you might say.
See, Calem Ware is gone.
Mr. Baskam here
had to shoot him down in self-defense.
Calem dead?
So you just stick to your ranch
and leave the town to us...
or worse than this will be happening.
I knew you were capable of many things,
I didn't know you'd go this far.
- This is only the beginning.
- But the night ends it all.
If I'm to stay out of your town...
then you are to keep away
from my ranch and my wife.
I didn't say anything before...
because I figured Cora is old enough
to know her own mind.
But now I'm warning you.
You are warning me?
I'm too old to call a man out,
but I will if I have to.
Your wife wouldn't be worth
the trouble, Asaph.
You don't think I really wanted her, do you?
It amused me, that's all, to take
something away from the great Asaph Dean.
She's unimportant now.
It'll be as it was 20 years ago.
Only I won't be 20 years younger
to fight them.
It'll be the old order again,
plundering, fighting...
A lifetime of hard work...
and hopes...
nothing.
- I'll leave the ranch as soon as I can.
- Leave?
Knowing about Hamer Thorne and me...
Look for yourself, Asaph.
What do you see?
I'm getting old.
Even I can understand that now.
We're both too old for such foolishness.
Soon we'll forget and look ahead.
I'll let you turn out the lights.
I'm rather tired.
Calem.
Calem Ware?
Mrs. Dean. What are you doing here?
- I want to see the marshal.
- Come in.
I guess you haven't heard the news.
Harley Baskam shot down Calem Ware
earlier tonight.
- I'm too late.
- Too late for what?
It's as if I killed him. I'm the one to blame.
I should have told the marshal.
- I didn't know it could happen.
- What...
What could you have told Calem?
I've been very foolish, Doc.
I've been a very close friend
of Hamer Thorne for a long time.
I knew all about the plans
he and Cody Clark had...
for taking over Medicine Bend.
Would you be willing to swear to that?
Yes, I would.
Knowing what it would do
to your reputation?
Women close their eyes
to a lot of things, Doc...
when they love the wrong man.
Not to murder.
I'll testify any time you say.
You'll find me at the ranch
when you want me.
Dooley.
Any change?
Okay, take them back to the mine.
- So this is where he lived.
- Ever since he come here three years ago.
Never changed it none. Kept it simple.
Marshal Ware was a simple man.
He never asked for much
or never expected much.
I guess I'll have to pack what there is.
I remember the day he walked in,
carrying this same old carpet bag.
This held everything he owned...
and still will.
He used to have these shirts
made special in Kansas City.
Wouldn't trust nobody
to wash them, except me.
No, I ain't going to touch nothing
till Doc Wynn tells me to.
I didn't know Calem Ware had many friends.
Only those who really understood him,
like me and Doc Wynn.
The others he fooled
so they'd think he was tough.
But he wasn't.
I remember the first meal
I ever cooked for him.
He usually ate in the kitchen.
He right away asked me to marry him.
- Marry you?
- That was just his little joke.
He always said it
when I'd cook something special.
You loved him, too, didn't you?
It weren't no gunman killed him.
It was the beast that killed him,
the wild beast, that's this town.
He could hear it every morning.
Knew it was out there waiting for him.
He was only living for the day
when he didn't hear it.
Then he'd know it was dead.
This was Calem Ware's room.
- You asked to see it.
- Yes.
Yes, thanks.
My things at the theatre will be packed
after tonight's performance.
Would you see that
they get to the stage depot for me?
- Yes, Miss Dickinson.
- Thank you.
- This message is for you.
- Thank you.
Mrs. Ware.
It's a long time
since I heard that name used.
I'd like to see you a moment...
alone.
- lf it's about Calem, I know.
- Do you now?
Do you know that I have got him
in a cell over at he jail...
right this minute, as alive as both of us?
- Alive?
- We don't want it to get around just yet.
He'll carry a permanent part in his hair,
but by tomorrow...
he'll be waking down the streets
of this town again.
When they said he was dead...
I thought it was the worst thing
that could happen to me. Now I wonder.
I've known for years something had
been eating on Calem like an acid.
- Now I know it was you.
- You think I'm a coward?
- You're not woman enough for Calem Ware.
- You wouldn't understand...
but it doesn't matter
because I'm leaving tomorrow.
Go ahead, run out.
Losing you again is gonna hurt him...
not any more than he's been hurt already.
But it's a cinch he's better off
without a woman like you.
Last chance to get your bets down,
the race is about to start.
Once around the town
and finish at the hotel.
Let's start the race. Are you ready, boys?
Get set.
I wouldn't go out in the streets, ma'am.
Miners and riffraff are overrunning the town.
Look out for the horse race!
Doc.
- What do you want, another lecture?
- Please, may I see Calem?
I'll get him.
Doc.
- Your wife's here, she wants to see you.
- How does she...
Why'd you tell her, Doc?
She's leaving town tomorrow.
I figured she should know.
It's all over between us.
Goodbyes have been said, and maybe...
Maybe it's better that way.
Maybe then she'll find peace of mind.
Wish her the best of luck.
Calem's in no shape
to see anyone, Mrs. Ware.
You mean he won't see me.
- What did he say?
- Just said to wish you the best of luck.
- That's all?
- Yes, ma'am.
What were you going to tell him?
Nothing. Now.
- Look at it. It's only the beginning.
- And every third one's mine.
- Don't worry, you'll get yours.
- What do you mean by that?
Think of the prestige a man would have
if he killed the man who killed Calem Ware.
Don't pay no attention to Cody.
He's drinking.
- Here's to the first million.
- And to the second.
Something's wrong.
You're crazy, everything's all right.
No, listen.
You're hearing things.
That's the trouble, I'm not. Listen.
Out on the street, what do you hear?
There ain't a sound, no yelling, nothing.
What of it?
Everybody's in saloons. Everybody...
Give me a shot, quick.
- What's the matter?
- I saw him. Plain as day.
Closed up my place.
But he'd dead. He's dead.
- What are you talking about?
- Calem Ware, heading this way.
And all Texas streets dying in front of him.
Let him sleep it off in the back.
- He says he saw Calem Ware.
- How could he? I killed him.
- Are you sure you killed him?
- Cody was there.
Don't know.
I don't like it.
I don't like it quiet like.
Shut up!
It's Calem. Calem Ware. He's alive.
I don't know how, but he's alive.
And he's closing up the whole town.
That crazy doctor. I should have known.
You heard it, Baskam? You missed him.
He's coming back to give you a second try.
Ever hear of a man who faced
Calem Ware's gun twice and lived?
Baskam, the law against
packing guns still stands.
There's another charge against you now.
The murder of Abe Deland
of the Prairie House.
Drop your gun and come out
with your hands high.
Come and get me.
Folks, Medicine Bend is closed for tonight.
Get out of here, everyone of you.
A whole town fallen flat on it's face
because of one man.
And he won't stop at Baskam. We're next.
You're a gambler.
Sometimes you've got to lose.
Get my fast rig.
Meet me behind the opera house.
I'll clean out my safe.
You've got 10 minutes to close this place.
I never saw you
wear a pistol before, Thorne.
That gun-slinging husband of yours
has gone crazy.
He's already killed Harley Baskam
and now he's out to gun me down.
Yes, I know. Doc told me all about you.
You had me fooled completely, Thorne.
Sorry, I don't have time to discuss it
right now, we're in a hurry.
- We?
- Not you, my dear.
Cody Clark is waiting for me out back.
Not that I wouldn't enjoy
your company more.
Your nosey husband
better not get in our way.
Calem!
Calem, don't go around to the back,
they'll be waiting for you!
We will be waiting for him.
No, Thorne, no.
Thorne, you fool.
Hold it.
Calem...
Cora told me everything.
I've been a fool, Calem.
I and others like me. Cowards.
Sitting back and letting one man,
just because he wears a badge...
do a job single-handed
that all of us should be doing.
But we're backing your play now.
- What'll we do with him?
- Ask Mr. Dean here.
Calem, what does this mean?
The people of this town
don't need a man like me any longer.
It isn't just the badge that makes the law,
it takes the right people to stick together...
fight and find out what it stands for.
Now you've done it.
They sound clean, don't they?
I guess I never heard them
right before, Molly.
Marshal, when you get to your ranch,
you'll be hungry for a hot meal.
Just take this and heat it up.
It's Mulligan stew.
I meant to ask...
what did you hear this morning?
Nothing, Molly, nothing but church bells.
The beast will never growl again.
- Calem!
- Take care of yourself.
Seeing as how you're really leaving,
I made up some stuff you better take along.
Some bandages and medicine
you'll be wanting.
- How much medicine do you think I'll need?
- That isn't all medicine.
Here's the real medicine I fixed up for you.
And it's the only medicine in the world
that'll cure what ails you right now.
I tried to tell you yesterday...
that I finally saw the town as you saw it.
If you could spare the time,
I'm out of muscle.
So long, Doc.
Souvenir for you.
