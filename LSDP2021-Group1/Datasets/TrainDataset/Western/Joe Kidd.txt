Got some nice breakfast
for you boys.
Hey, Joe!
Wake up and eat something.
You're gonna appear
before the judge.
He's stinking drunk.
Why you put him in here?
We don't want him.
Güero son of a bitch...
woke us up.
He don't give a damn.
Joe, you hear me?
You're gonna appear
before the judge.
- Bob Mitchell hit me?
- Yup.
- Who else?
- And some others.
It took three of 'em
to get you in here last night.
I'll be back for you.
Smells good, huh?
Güero,
you would like some?
You say,
"Please, Señor Naco."
Say it!
I want to remind you,
we're not suing
anybody yet.
We're here to see if any
of you have a legal claim.
If you do, then a suit will be filed
that you can take to court.
I want you to think
before you act.
I don't know whether or not
the land grants you claim to have...
signed by the King of Spain
or the Emperor of Mexico...
are gonna stand up
against the deeds and titles...
on file in
this courthouse.
I do have other
court matters to attend to,
so I'm gonna postpone
these hearings until tomorrow.
Give careful consideration
to what you're doing.
I advise you
to be prudent...
before you take
a legal action...
that's gonna set some
people's teeth on edge.
- Calvin?
- Yo.
Give me Joe Kidd
right now.
Come on, Joe.
They're waitin' on ya.
Hey, güero, want some?
Go ahead, take it.
! Hijole chingado!
You want some?
Calvin, what in the hell's
going on in there?
Nothin'. Boy just
spilled his breakfast.
Shouldn't have
hit me, Bob.
Next time, I'll knock
your damn head off.
Let's go see the judge.
Your Honor, I've got
three warrants on Joe Kidd:
poaching, disorderly,
and resisting arrest.
- You said "poaching"?
- Yes, sir.
A witness saw him carrying a buck
off the Jicarilla reservation.
You arrested a man
for shooting a deer?
I warned him before.
He admits killing it.
- What did you do with this deer?
- I ate him.
You know it's against the law
to hunt on reservation land?
The deer didn't know
where he was,
and I wasn't sure, either.
You plead guilty?
I'm sayin' I shot a mule deer
south of Monero.
That's on the reservation.
I told him he had to pay
a fine and he got nasty.
- That's the disorderly charge?
- No, sir.
On the disorderly, I had to
arrest him for something else.
What?
He was standing out there
and he claimed he was gonna...
urinate over the courthouse.
You do just about whatever
you feel like, is that it?
Anything else?
Yes, there is.
Whether you want
to pay a $10 fine...
or spend 10 days in jail.
I'll take the 10 days.
Your Honor?
This court's adjourned
until 2:00.
You think you're
gonna sit in that jail...
while Calvin waits on you?
You're gonna paint,
scrub floors. I'm gonna...
I want to warn you people you're in
a United States territorial court.
We have listened to you enough.
Now...
Now it is our turn.
When the Anglo first wished
to build a house in Sinola,
he asked permission.
Yes, yes.
The old people, our grandfathers,
say "It is all right.
There is enough land.
Let the Anglo have a home."
Then you build more houses.
You bring in the railroad.
You make the courthouse.
That is when we begin to
hear you say strange things.
Two years ago, we start to
see about our land claims.
We go to the record office
in Santa Fe...
and ask the man for the copies
of our deeds and the titles.
You know what he say?
"We don't have records
like that anymore.
"There was a fire.
All the records
got burned up."
If you feel you have a
legal claim and can prove it...
We've heard all that!
Ricardo.
We let you use our land,
but you wish to steal it all!
Look, mister,
whatever your name is...
I am Luis Chama.
So you're Chama?
I feel you're a lot more
trouble than you're worth.
But I'm still
gonna inform you,
you're committing a criminal offense
before a witness in a court of justice.
That is the word.
Justice!
Later we will have much
time to talk about it.
What are you staring at?
I just want to make sure I remember
your face when you come to trial.
I want to show you something.
Anglos claim
they own all the land now.
Big cattle
and timber companies.
One day,
one day there was a fire.
! Que viva!
Pon el juez en la carreta.
Vamonos.
Stay where you are!
He's going with us.
Talk to him about the law
and the land rights.
What do you want him for?
Take Mitchell.
Mitchell's an expert
on rights.
- Think they'll shoot us?
- Maybe, maybe not.
Luis, he's got the judge!
- Who's with him?
- Joe Kidd. He was in the jail.
I don't care about him.
Get the judge!
I suggest you go right
on out back, Your Honor.
Hello, Joe.
How'd you make out?
I'm not sure yet, Harry.
Ah, güerito,
you're thirsty, huh?
Where is he?
He went home.
Naco! Naco!
Your friends
are calling you.
Vamonos, pronto, Naco.
I guess I better go.
I guess so.
- Naco!
- Maybe...
we'll see each other
in jail again, huh?
That's possible.
- Adios.
- Adios.
Naco, vamonos.
Calvin!
Where in the hell
have you been?
They broke those
two fellas out of jail!
- I said, where the hell have you been?
- Locked up.
- Where?
- In jail.
Form a posse!
Get mounted! Get your guns!
Goddamn!
Cheese.
I'll take the posse out.
You stay here.
Try to keep law and order
while I'm gone.
- How are we gonna find him?
- He just left fresh tracks.
They scattered tracks
all over!
How're we gonna know which
ones are Luis Chama's?
He gets up in them mountains,
he'll be home!
Now just a damn minute!
I'm not begging you
to go with me.
You want to sit on
your fat asses while...
that wild son of a bitch
is loose, that's up to you.
If you don't mind him
cutting your fences, running your stock,
that's all right with me,
but get outta the way,
'cause I'm gonna bring back
him or his hair.
Joe, what are you doin'
standing there?
Hmm.
Serving 10 days.
Bob, you know Joe's
the one we need.
You wanna go?
I haven't got anything
against Luis Chama.
Posse couldn't get him.
You think that's gonna work?
Joe, you take your broom,
that shovel, that rake,
and that bucket.
Get over to courthouse square
and pick up everything...
that's not nailed down
or painted.
- Howdy, Mr. Harlan.
- Howdy.
- Go to the Grand Hotel.
- You betcha.
Whoa.
Good morning, Mr. Harlan.
These telegraph messages come in
last night and this morning,
one all the way from Chicago.
Mr. Harlan,
I want you to know...
what a pleasure it is to
have you and your friends.
It's been two, three months.
Seems like yesterday. Oh, my, no.
I'm glad you weren't
here yesterday.
I guess you heard about
the excitement we had.
I've reserved the
governor's suite for you...
and two other rooms.
Will that be it?
Mr. Harlan?
I want the whole second floor.
Oh, I've got guests
in the other rooms.
I mean, I don't have
extra space anywhere.
What am I supposed to do?
I can't very well tell them
to get out, can I?
Gimme $10 a head and
I'll throw them out the window.
Say the rooms are spoken for
and there's nothing you can do.
If they give you trouble,
give me a holler.
- What's wrong with saying
the rooms are spoken for?
- Send this out.
Hello, Mr. Harlan.
Ma'am.
Anything I can do for you?
I want to see a man
named Joe Kidd.
Joe Kidd's
locked up in jail.
If he weren't,
I doubt we'd be talking.
You knew we had him
locked up?
I'd like to pay the fine on him.
Send him over to me.
Didn't know he was
a friend of yours.
We'll be on
the second floor.
Joe, Mr. Harlan
wants to see you.
Who?
- Mr. Harlan.
- I don't know the man.
- Do you know his name?
- Never heard of him.
He knows you and
he's paid your fine.
- He wants to see you right now.
- Yeah? Where is he?
Over at the hotel.
- And he's paid my fine, huh?
- Mm-hmm.
Well, he can't be all bad.
- Joe Kidd?
- Yeah.
Be with you in a minute.
Hey, aren't you
gonna wait?
You sure don't look
like you're supposed to.
Just how am I
supposed to look?
You're all dressed
like some town dude.
Were you really leavin'?
Not going to wait?
He asked to see me, but if he's busy,
maybe some other time.
You don't know Mr. Harlan
very well, do you?
Is that what you call him?
Mr. Harlan?
I call him Frank,
and a few other things. Why?
Well, you...
don't look like his daughter,
and I don't think
you're his wife.
I'm not his mother,
either.
But you do take care
of him at times?
Ask him, if you'd like.
Or find out for myself?
How long have
they had you locked up?
Two days.
What would you be like
after two months?
We wouldn't even
be talking now.
Mr. Harlan
can see you now.
Mr. Harlan,
Joe Kidd.
Mr. Kidd.
Mr. Joe Kidd.
You come well recommended.
Judge Vince Brennan, 4th Territorial
Court, spoke very highly of you.
Man with the Indian bureau,
name of Wattles,
said you worked up at the
Jicarilla Apache station,
know the mountains and game trails
better than anybody.
You were supplying
their meat for 'em?
Yeah, I worked
for them a few years.
Before that,
I understood you hunted men,
anybody with
a price on his head.
Good at it.
That was a long time ago.
You got a one-loop outfit
you work when you're not out hunting.
I get out now and then,
yeah.
We propose to spend a week,
maybe 10 days.
Pay you whatever
your rate is.
A bonus for everything
we shoot worth mounting.
Get us some mule deer,
some elk,
maybe one of them
mountain cats...
if we see one.
You think
this piece of iron...
will stop one of them
big old cats?
I suppose it would,
if he lets you get close enough.
If you get close enough.
hear that, Mingo?
I'd like you to meet
my associates, Mr. Olin Mingo,
Lamarr Sims.
This is Roy Gannon.
These gentlemen are A-1,
first-class hunters.
I'd bet them against
anybody at any distance.
You believe that?
If he says so,
it's all right with me.
Whatever he says,
that's it.
Let me show you
something here, buddy.
Shut the window, Lamarr.
We're gonna need four horses,
which we'll buy off you,
if you want.
Come to your place tomorrow
and start in the morning.
You're asking me
to guide for ya?
What do you think
I've been talking about?
I don't hire out to guide.
Either hunting
for animals or men.
You don't believe
we're after mule deer?
You're after Luis Chama.
Seen through it right away.
You got a keen eye.
It's simple. You deal in land
and he wants to take it away.
If the sheriff here
can't stop him, I will.
I got claim to 935 sections,
nearly 600,000 acres,
and I'm not gonna permit some
sheepherder named Luis Chama...
to get away with
cutting fences...
and stirring up the Mexican population
with talk about land reform.
Nor am I gonna waste time
arguing it in court.
Here it is.
I'll give you...
$500 to help us
track that man.
If it's your shot gets him,
it's all right with me.
$500.
What do you say?
- I already said it.
- Wait a minute, sir.
I paid a fine,
got you out of jail.
If you want
your $10 back,
I'll serve out
the rest of the time.
Ah...
he's going on
a huntin' trip.
I'll be back.
Emilio?
Vita?
Joseph!
Se llevaron a Emilio.
Se llevaron los caballos.
They take him.
They take the horses, too.
- When did this happen?
- This morning.
Emilio say, "Stay home."
And they take him.
There. Arriba.
Up there.
Joseph.
Joseph,
where you been?
Did Chama do this?
With some of his men.
They take some horses
and shoot the rest.
The one say you kill a friend,
so he do this.
Say he's
gonna kill you, too.
Where the hell do you
think you're going?
Come on in.
You want Luis Chama?
Got thinkin' about the money,
did ya? Changed your mind?
- Do you want him?
- I told you the deal.
$500, and I don't care
who pulls the trigger.
The price will be $1,000.
All right.
Anything else?
Nope.
I'll meet you downstairs.
You want something?
You know how many holes
I can put in you with this gun?
Lamarr, I got a dollar says
I can break your neck...
before you get that rig
moved a half inch.
Yeah.
Mr. Harlan wants you around.
That's the only reason
I don't plug you right now.
When Mr. Harlan doesn't
want me around anymore,
you let me know, huh, boy?
If I was to say
my prayers, we might get lucky...
and find him sittin' home
waitin' on us, Mingo.
"How do you do, Mr. Chama?
For a dumb-ass sheep dipper,
"you sure been
bothering me.
Causin' all kinds
of discomfort."
There's supposed to be
a road west of here.
We could save some time.
Game doesn't
walk down roads.
We're supposed to be
hunting mule deer.
If we find somebody walking down
the road, which don't seem likely.
Well, we've had company now
for about a mile.
- Where at?
- Both sides of us.
- I don't see a goddamn thing. How many?
- Three, maybe more.
- What the hell's going on?
- Keep your mouth shut.
We got people going with us.
Maybe Chama, maybe not.
- I don't see anybody.
- I see 'em, Frank.
You bet.
Right where he said.
I could wing one,
if you wanted to talk to him.
They're not much for
staying hid, are they?
No, they're showing themselves,
showing they don't give a darn.
They know they've
got us outnumbered.
Buenos dias, señor.
Buenos dias.
Nice looking string
you have there.
Still green.
They'll be all right.
- You rope 'em?
- Yeah.
We chased them
three or four days.
You haven't by any chance
seen any elk, have you?
No. Some deer.
You out hunting, eh?
You haven't been home
for a while?
No, not for a few days.
You want some game?
Go in the San Juans.
Maybe you get a bear.
My friend, I want
to ask you a question.
I want to ask it
only one time.
Yeah?
Where's Luis Chama?
Luis Chama.
Yeah, I saw him sometime.
Are you looking for him?
Well, we gotta go.
If I see Luis Chama,
I'll tell him you're asking for him.
Vamonos.
Adios.
Mingo,
I want him alive.
I got him through the arm.
He must have jumped.
I was aiming for his shoulder.
- You say you saw Luis Chama where?
- I don't know anybody that name.
We can cut your ears off
if you want.
I don't know him.
We can cut
somethin' else off, too.
Dile, hombre.
? Para qué quieres que te pegue?
He says, tell you anything.
Why get chopped up?
Chico, the only way you're gonna stay
alive is if you answer my questions.
You understand that?
I'm asking,
where is Luis Chama?
I don't know him!
Lamarr.
I came to hunt Chama,
not kill people in cold blood.
I don't have time
for court hearings.
If these people want to fight me,
I'll blow 'em straight to hell.
Anybody home?
Hello.
Well, well.
Look what I have found.
Evenin'.
Honey, I want
to ask you something.
You know a man
name of Luis Chama?
I know him.
- You see him lately?
- No.
- When was the last time?
- About a week ago.
Are you a friend?
- I see him when he goes by here.
- On his way to Arroyo Blanco?
You know where that is?
It's over the pass.
- I don't think he lives there anymore.
- We're friends.
We just want to stop in
and say "hello."
Is that why you have
all those guns?
This is a huntin' trip,
sweetheart.
You gotta have guns.
Ask her how come
she's got so many guns!
They belong to my
father and brother.
Where are they?
They went to see
a man about work.
Leave you here by yourself,
do they?
I don't mind being alone
for a few days.
Pretty girl like you
shouldn't be left alone.
Maybe we ought to camp here,
if she was to invite us.
- What's your name, honey?
- Helen Sanchez.
Helen, what
would you think...
if we stayed out here
with you tonight?
I think you're going to do
whatever you want.
They'd like
some more coffee.
- Have you told them yet?
- Nope.
Why not?
I didn't figure it was
any of their business really.
But you are with them.
Let's say
I made a poor judgment,
but I'm gonna have
to live with it for a while.
When I was in jail there in town,
there was a man named Naco.
He died two days ago.
He shouldn't
have come at me.
But you want Chama,
so you joined them.
Everybody wants Chama.
He's gonna get shot or hanged.
I think he realizes that now.
Some people would give their
lives for what they believe.
Do you understand that?
I guess so, if they want
something bad enough.
No. Even if there's no chance,
but to do it for others...
like a soldier
gives his life.
You don't know Luis Chama!
- Maybe you never met anybody like him.
- Maybe not.
Were you with him
when he came by my place?
Yes, I was there.
You want to kill me, too?
- A man named Emilio was with my horses.
- I remember him.
Ramon went back to see
if he was following us.
Ramon, huh?
Next stop,
Bandera Station.
- Isn't anything there but stock pens.
- Wanna bet?
- Mr. Harlan, where you been?
- Took our time...
to give you a chance to rest
from your train ride.
We expected
you'd be here waitin'.
We're here now, Eljay.
Yes, sir. Let's go!
We're ready.
All those guns
to kill one man.
Yeah.
If they find him.
They're all hidin'.
Call everybody out in the street.
All right!
Everybody out in the street!
Hold your fire.
They're way up in those rocks.
Chama?
You hit one of my men,
I'll kill ten
of your people!
Good morning, Padre.
Call all your people out here.
We're gonna hold services
here in the street.
Vengan aqui todos.
Bring 'em out,
out in the street!
Vengan tranquilos.
Vengan todos. No tengan miedo.
Vengan sin miedo.
Vengan tranquilos.
Roy?
Now, then,
I don't want to take up
much of your time.
I just want to say...
that we're gonna shoot
five of you if Luis Chama...
don't come down off his mountain
by sunup tomorrow morning!
If he don't show by noon,
we shoot five more.
Still doesn't show up
by supper time,
we put five more
against that wall.
Now the next day, if we have to,
we'll start all over again.
Son.
- ? Habla usted inglés?
- Si.
- Do you have a horse?
- I have a horse.
I want you to get on your horse
and go upstairs, there,
and ask Luis Chama
if he heard what I said,
in case he didn't
understand me.
- ? Comprende?
- Si, señor.
Padre, get 'em all
inside the church.
Vamos a la iglesia.
El resto espere en la iglesia
hasta que viene...
o todos estan muertos,
? Comprenden?
Repeat the whole sermon,
in case any of them
American citizens...
don't understand English.
! Oigan, arriba!
Si Luis Chama no baja
de la montaña para la mañana...
vamos a matar
cinco de ustedes.
Si no viene
para mediodia,
mataremos
cinco mas.
Y en la tarde, lo mismo.
Mañana lo mismo.
? Comprenden?
Stake out your men, Eljay.
Put the horses down at the other end
of town. Leave the saddles on.
Me and the little girl
will bunk in here.
Kidd, you're fired.
Take his gun, Mingo.
Put him in the church.
Look at him.
Without his gun he looks
like a big, dumb farm boy.
Go ahead, farm boy.
Take your pick.
I know it's
a crappy deal, buddy,
but that's all you got.
What's the matter?
You run out of nerve?
Go ahead, grab.
'Cause I'm gonna
blow your head off.
I said, make a grab.
Aaah!
Jesus!
That boy don't ever learn.
Well, the fun's over
and he's gone to church.
Tenemos que rezar mucho.
Are you thirsty?
- Yeah. What do you got there?
- Holy water.
I've drunk
just about everything else.
I might as well
have some holy water.
Today is the feast of
St. James, the apostle,
one of the first martyrs.
I will tell the people,
"Pray to him,
for his strength
and courage."
St. James was beheaded
rather than deny his faith.
You wouldn't have a gun around here,
would you, Padre?
Good time of day, Eljay.
Day's work's done,
man's waiting on a good supper.
Open the door, Mick.
- What about these people?
Are you gonna feed them?
- Feed 'em.
Roy, let him get some food
for these people in here.
! Señora, señora!
Dele comida para la gente.
Hey, Lamarr,
how're you feelin'?
That medicine
easing the pain any?
You just keep talkin'.
You'll be spittin' teeth
all night.
That's a high-priced waiter
you got there, Roy.
Ha, ha, ha.
You gonna eat all that?
- It's for the glutton outside.
- Oh, yeah.
How's he treatin' you?
We're going to get married.
What the hell do you think?
You wouldn't by any chance
have a loaded gun I could use,
would you?
Don't do anything foolish.
Wait for Luis.
I've been wondering about that.
The boy they sent out seems to be
having trouble finding his way back.
- He's hunting for Chama.
- Think so?
Luis is up there.
He knows, and he'll come.
With a gun or without one,
but he'll come.
I certainly do hope so.
If he doesn't,
he's gonna disappoint
an awful lot of people.
You don't blink soon,
your eyeballs will fall out.
Hey, how 'bout somebody else
comin' up here for a while?
You wanna take that,
Lamarr?
Why not?
Come on, Lamarr.
Let's get up here.
When this is over,
we finish it.
From the table where
they put the guns.
I don't even
know if it fires.
Don't worry.
It fires.
I have lived here
with my people 33 years.
and this morning,
I can't look in their faces.
I can't bless five of them...
and send them outside.
Well, Padre,
we'll see.
- He's dead.
- Yeah, I believe you.
Send up his gun and hat,
will ya?
Hey, Lamarr,
don't you fall asleep up there.
Why don't you go screw yourself?
That sweet boy's
fallen asleep,
or he's fallen
off the tower.
Oh, let him alone.
He's had a bad night.
Let's get five of 'em
out here. Come on.
I want Chama to see the facts of life
starin' him in the face.
Roy. Mingo.
You fellas get out
in the field.
Get against the rocks
where you can do some good!
There they are, Chama!
Are you gonna
come down now?
Chama, you've
got one minute!
That's not much of
a shot for you, is it, Mingo?
- It's where you hit 'em.
- I'll pick a spot.
First man, second button.
For six bits.
But you gotta hit the button.
For six bits, I'll hit
the second button on both men.
Jesus!
Mingo, shoot two of 'em,
right now.
- How're you doing?
- Don't touch it.
You would've let them
kill those people.
I'm going to tell
you something,
and you must listen
and try and understand.
If our people are killed
for what we are doing,
they will become names,
they will live forever.
Martyrs? I think we have
enough of them already.
Then why do you want me
to become one?
Listen!
We only win
if I stay alive.
If those men kill me now,
who will take my place?
Do you understand?
You'd let people die for you?
For themselves.
For what they believe.
They believe in you.
I am telling you how it is.
There is no other way!
I know another way.
Come with me,
back to Sinola.
Give yourself up,
take your chances in court.
Stay out of it.
You brought me into it...
when you stole my horses
and bob-wired my man.
And you killed one of ours.
So, you help her. Now we are even.
Go home while you can.
He is right.
We must give ourselves up.
Don't you see?
There is no other way.
I do not care
what you think.
I take you along
for cold nights...
and days when there
is nothing to do,
not to hear you talk.
Harlan!
You want Chama?
You'll find him
in the Sinola jail.
Let's mount up.
Just like that, huh?
Straight up or draped over
the saddle, either one.
What about my men?
I don't much care about them.
They can come along or stay,
whatever pleases them.
Listen to this Anglo
son-of-a-bitch!
Luis, say it,
we throw him off the cliff.
No te metas en esto.
Bien, que éste
no es el lugar.
All right. This isn't the time.
We will settle this later.
Vamonos con él.
? Pero quién sabe
hasta donde?
The train stop here,
Mr. Harlan?
It'll stop, Eljay.
Hold your fire.
They're out of range.
No disparen.
Esta muy lejos.
Compadre.
There'll be eleven.
Hi.
Hey, little girl.
Oh. You don't let a person
get a chance to breathe.
I'll get you breathing
so you're never gonna stop.
- You miss me?
- 'Course I did.
- You stayed here in the room?
- I sure did.
Like hell you did.
Mr. Harlan, ma'am,
how was your huntin' trip?
- Mitchell, how you been?
- Just fine.
Someone's gonna bring
Luis Chama in tomorrow,
and I want you to
hand him over to me.
- What'd you say?
- I want you to hand him over to me.
- Mr. Harlan...
- Take a few days off and get drunk!
Tomorrow's Sunday.
Go to church and pray...
that I don't see you again
'til this is done!
Little girl, find some whiskey
and pour me a drink.
Good morning.
Let's open up.
- We're closed.
- You're open.
We're open.
All right, I say Chama
goes to jail, pleads his case.
What do you say?
Adios, compadres.
Que les vaya bien.
Not you, Ramon.
Ramon.
Lead off, huh?
I figured
we might be too close.
Come on in, Kidd.
Nobody's gonna hurt you.
Hey, Kidd.
Bring Chama over here.
Come on in, Kidd.
Mitchell!
Got a prisoner for ya.
Jesus, Joe!
Here. Give me some cover.
Start with the hotel.
Bob,
get out of here!
Good luck.
Well,
that settles that.
Anything
I can do for you, Joe?
Come on.
Joe, you shouldn't
have done that.
Next time, I'll knock
your damn head off.
