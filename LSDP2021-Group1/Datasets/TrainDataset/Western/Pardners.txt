You got five minutes, Kingsley.
You coming out
or are we coming in after you?
- Sam Hollis.
- I know.
Come out! Wade, come out here!
- There's no room for your kind.
- Don't try to be a hero, Wade.
We'll let you live.
Looks like Hollis means business.
I think he's out to get you this time,
Wade.
I know, Slim, but I ain't a-scared none.
- There's only 12 of them out there.
- And remember, can't be no shooting.
We got to think of our wives and kids.
- Sally!
- Coming, Slim.
They're back again, huh?
What are you going to do?
We're gonna fight! Matilda!
- Where are you going, Matilda?
- Back to New York.
- And I'm taking little Wade with me.
- Excuse me, Sally.
You can't walk out on Big Wade now.
He's in trouble.
It's not my fault. Father was right.
I never should have come West.
You're savages, all of you.
They killed your brother, Wade.
Your father, Carol.
And they'll kill you, too.
Well, I'm bringing my son up in the city
where he can learn
to live like a gentleman!
Are you coming with us?
A man has got to stay and fight
for his land.
Well, little Wade and I
don't have to stay.
Kiss him goodbye
and bring him here to me.
- Will you be here?
- I'll be here.
- Matilda.
- Goodbye, little Wade!
You got five minutes, Kingsley!
You coming out
or are we coming in after you?
- I'll get little Slim.
- Yeah.
And put a slow fire under the supper.
- I think we're gonna be a little late.
- Please be careful, both of you.
Don't worry about us.
Worry about them.
Hurry along, Slim, time's a wasting.
Your time is up, Kingsley!
- Ready, Wade?
- All set, Slim.
Let's go. Wade!
- Cover me.
- I got you.
I warned you both to get off this land,
Kingsley.
This land belongs to him!
Let's string 'em up, men.
Let's get 'em, pardner!
I'm with you, Slim!
Wade! He really hit me, Wade.
Slim!
Hollis, you skunk.
You ain't getting away, Hollis!
You ain't getting away.
You're through, Hollis. Get up.
- I said get up!
- Yeah. Yeah, I will.
I know your kind.
Without a gang behind you,
you're nothing.
You're a coward!
And I ain't afraid of no coward.
I spurn you, and I turn my back on you.
Slim!
Over here, Wade.
- What happened?
- I think he got me.
So long, pardner.
So long, pardner.
Don't worry, Slim,
some day our sons will avenge us.
Yeah. I'll see you up in that big pasture
with the whistling wind in the sky.
Jim, you're all
a panicky bunch of rabbits.
But today the market is very unstable.
Thank you, Mr Graham.
Thank you, Mr Baxter.
You're welcome, Master Wade.
Same time tomorrow?
Yes, thank you.
- Thank you, Mr Hawkins.
- Thank you, Master Wade.
I almost made it that time,
didn't I, Mr Hawkins?
Almost.
Mr Hawkins, did you tell Mother
that I wanted to have a word with her?
Yes, Master Wade. She's in conference.
- She's in conference.
- She said you're to wait in your room.
- She'll come in as soon as she's free.
- I see.
Mrs Kingsley, I must still advise you
to sell your shipping holdings
and put the money
into conservative bond issues.
That's exactly what I expected to hear
you say, Jim.
That's why you'll always be working
for a salary.
We'll have to continue with this
next Saturday, gentlemen.
I'm giving an engagement party
for my son tonight.
- Wade is getting married?
- Yes!
- Who is the lucky girl?
- Amanda Wentwon'th.
- Wentwon'th Consolidated.
- Exactly.
They can't move their products
without ships.
Wade must be very excited
about getting married.
I haven't told him yet.
All right. Are you ready, Mr Hawkins?
- All ready, sir.
- Fine. Then go!
- I got you that time, Mr Hawkins.
- Bravo, Master Wade, bravo.
- Wasrt that a good one?
- Very good, sir, very good.
- Good, Master Wade, good.
- All right, now don't move, Laura.
'Cause this is a very tricky one.
- I got you, you varmint.
- Oh, how dare you!
Get going, boy.
We're gonna make tracks, boy.
- Get me up!
- Oh, yes, Mrs Kingsley.
Of course, Mrs Kingsley.
Get going, get going, boy. It's thieves.
Move! They're closing in on us.
Get going.
Don't slow up now, boy.
They've got us completely surrounded.
Get going!
I'll give you one minute
to get out of that disgusting outfit.
- Yes, Mother.
- I want to talk to you.
Oh, I'm sorry!
You're a quitter.
I'm sorry I kept you waiting, Mother.
- Sit down.
- Yes, Mother.
Tomorrow's your birthday.
I shall be very sorry to lose you.
Lose me? I'm not gonna die.
Dr Meister said that my heart is fine.
Except occasionally
I do get a little high-strung.
- Oh, be quiet!
- I'm quiet.
It hasn't been easy bringing you up
without a father.
And may I say
your father didn't amount to much.
Wasrt there anything good at all
about my mother, Father?
I mean,
wasrt there anything good at all
about my father, Mother?
Nothing. He was a cowboy,
a rough, untutored cowboy.
- By the way, you're getting married.
- I am? Well, congratulations to me.
- Anyone I know?
- Of course!
What kind of a mother
do you think I am?
I think that you're probably
one of the sweetest mothers
that a boy has ever had, Mother.
No. What I mean to say is,
what is the girl's name, if I may ask?
Amanda.
- That tall, mean girl?
- She's strong.
That's exactly what you need.
I'm announcing the engagement
at dinner tonight.
- Now, just a minute, Mother.
- Yes?
Well, what I mean to say is,
that this is a big step for a man,
and you just don't plunge
into these things.
Well, there's just something
I have to know.
- What is it?
- What time is dinner?
The usual time
and see that you're not late.
No, I won't be late, Mother.
I try my very best
to be prompt at all times.
Amanda! She's 7'2".
She's taller than me,
and she's mean and big,
and I haven't got a chance
with such a girl.
- Hello, Hawkins.
- Oh, I'm sorry, Miss Carol.
I have orders not to admit you.
But I must see my aunt, Hawkins.
It's terribly important.
- I'm afraid she won't see you.
- Well, tell her we're inside.
- She'll have to see us.
- We'll wait in the living room.
- We'll wait in the living room.
- You don't seem to understand.
Mrs Kingsley isn't going to like this.
Oh, dear.
Wow, this is a nice little barn.
You know, she's harder to see
than the President of the United States.
Well, Aunt Matilda's a little difficult.
You'll just have to charm her.
Oh, don't worry. I'll make an impression.
My antique chair!
- Well, I'm glad it was only an old one.
- Who are you?
Oh, well, this is Slim Moseley.
He's foreman of the K Ranch.
Howdy, ma'am.
Mrs Kingsley,
I believe you knew my father.
He worked for your husband.
- Yes. You're very like him.
- Well, thank you.
It wasrt intended as a compliment.
I don't think
my charm's getting through to her.
- What are you doing here?
- Well, we came for the rodeo.
Well, you see, ma'am, we're trying
to buy Cuddles, a champion bull,
and the K Ranch could build up
a fine-blooded line with him.
I fail to see how that affects me.
Well, Slim is gonna turn over
all his prize money.
But we'll still be a little short.
And Carol will lose the ranch
if you don't help her.
I'm not interested
in whether she keeps it or loses it.
Well, you should be.
Your husband died to save it.
- He was a fool.
- He was a hero.
- Nonsense.
- Well, he and my father were buddies.
- They died side by side.
- I don't want to hear about my husband.
What are you ashamed of?
The time that he and my father drove off
a pack of Indians
the night that Wade was born?
Or the time those three killers came
into town looking for him?
And you pleaded with him not to go.
And he said,
"Those killers are waiting for me."
Then he said goodbye to you.
He said goodbye to his little baby.
The baby cried and he patted it.
Then he opened the door
and walked down the street
to face those three killers.
And it was high noon,
ma'am, high noon.
The first killer was a giant, 6 feet tall,
squinty-eyes, no forehead.
The second was built like a gorilla,
a big gorilla.
The third one was a little man,
but mean.
A little, little man, very, very mean.
Then they met on the street,
and the three killers
started walking towards him.
Suddenly everybody started shooting
at once.
The first killer was shot in the chest.
The second killer was shot in the arm.
And the one who was shot in the arm
whipped out a gun from his hip,
and he started shooting at the shoulder.
And the one that was shot in the chest
reached for his shoulder holster,
and he shot with the shoulder holster.
The one that was shot in the arm,
he shot from the hip.
The one that was shooting from the hip,
shot with the shoulder,
then they whipped out two guns
and he shot 'em right in the heart,
bleeding blood, real red blood
they was bleeding.
And then he whipped around once,
he whipped around twice,
then he went back,
then he spun him around once,
and he spun him around twice,
and finally he looked up
and there he saw
the last killer coming towards him,
aiming.
He started to count,
one, two...
Three!
Oh, stop it! I've heard enough.
You haven't heard anything,
Mrs Kingsley.
The trouble is starting all over again.
There's a band of masked raiders
terrorizing the valley.
They're trying to drive
all the ranchers away.
That's the trouble with the K Ranch.
We lost a lot of stock.
Oh, please, Aunt Matilda,
if you'll help us this once,
I promise we'll never bother you again.
Hawkins, throw these people out!
Yes, ma'am.
You'll have to leave, sir.
Come on, Slim.
Thanks for being so neighbourly,
Mrs Kingsley.
It makes me appreciate
the killers out West.
Oh, my Ming vase!
Pick up a new one
and send me the bill, ma'am.
Hawkins, throw me out!
Will you look at them
trying to milk that wild cow!
Number 12 and 17 disqualified! No time!
Don't worry, Cuddles.
I'm still in first place.
We're going to take you home with us.
- You like my bull, eh, Slim?
- Sure do.
- I don't blame you.
- He'd be won'th a lot to the K Ranch.
Well, I hope
you can buy him from me, son.
The next team up
in the wild cow milking contest is
Number Two and Number Eight.
Slim Moseley and Killer Jones.
- That's me.
- Good luck.
There's not a man in the world that's
gonna stop me from winning this event.
I say, sir,
would you be good enough to tell me
where I could find Slim Moseley?
I mean...
Say, I don't like to disturb you, but I...
All right, cowboys, let's go!
Number Two and Number Eight!
Come on, Moseley,
you're holding up the show.
- I'm all set. Get Number Eight.
- Number Eight!
Number Eight, you have 60 seconds,
or according to the official rules,
you will both be disqualified
from the event.
I beg your pardon,
but I'm looking for Mr Moseley.
- You Eight?
- What?
- You Eight?
- Yes.
As a matter of fact,
I don't eat too much during the day.
Just a cookie and a glass of milk.
But I think it was the cookie with
the raisins that gave me the indigestion.
All right, hurry up.
Slim's waiting for you.
Oh, he is?
Fine. 'Cause I want to see him.
- He's out there!
- Oh, thank you very much.
People that just can't be neat.
Somebody's gonna trip
and hurt themselves.
Mr Moseley. Mr Moseley.
Hey, Mr Moseley, there was something
I wanted to talk to you about...
Let her go!
Disqualified! No time for Moseley.
Hey, Mr Moseley, you better be careful.
You're gonna get hurt.
And you were very careless back there.
- You dropped your rope.
- I did?
Oh, yeah, but don't worry,
I picked it up and tied it to the post.
- You tied it to the post?
- Yeah, you see, I thought that maybe...
Why, you!
If I get my hands on you, I'll...
Time's up and he made it!
Slim Moseley is up next.
Watch shoot Number Two.
Slim's riding Crazy Snake.
Let me have it!
Mr Moseley, can I talk to you a minute?
Get out of here, you'll get killed!
Well, I don't like to bother you,
but my mother's waiting and I got to go!
Will you get out of here?
Get out of here!
Here I go!
Moseley pulled leather!
He's disqualified.
Gee, that's too bad, Mr Moseley.
You should have held onto that horn
on the saddle.
I'll hold onto you!
And now we come to the last contestant
in our singing cowboy contest.
Get ready, Slim.
Now, we'll dim the lights down real low,
so we can all get in the mood
and hear a beautiful song of the range
from Slim Moseley.
The wind, the wind
The whistling wind
The wind
The wind
The whistling wind
A cowboy never rides alone
When the trail seems long
There's the friendly song
The song of the wind
The whistling wind
Where the wagon train
used to cross the plain
There's always the wind
The whistling wind
Whistling of the days of the long ago
Of the buffalo and the Navajo
Men like Daniel Boone
and the settlers too
And the West that grew
It's in the wind, all in the wind
The whistling wind
The whistling wind
When shadows pale along the trail
A cowboy never rides alone
'Cause he rides again
with the mighty men
Who ride in the wind
The whistling wind
When the shadows pale
On the long, long trail
There's always the wind
The whistling wind
The wind, the wind
The whistling wind
Ladies and gentlemen,
the judges have decided
that the winner of the singing cowboy
contest is Slim Moseley!
- Well, you did it.
- Here comes Cuddles.
The prize is
this beautiful silver loving cup.
There goes Cuddles.
Well, that's all the show, folks.
Thanks a lot. See you next year.
And adiós to you all.
Hi. I've been looking everywhere for you.
I'm not hard to find.
I'm in the loser's section.
Gee, it certainly was a big thrill
being your pardner.
Being my pardner?
On account of you, I lose the rodeo,
I lose Cuddles,
and my boss is gonna lose her ranch,
pardner.
I was only trying to help.
- Will you do me a favour?
- Yeah, sure. What is it?
- Don't help.
- What?
- Don't help. Now get out of here.
- No, I came here to see you.
- I'm Wade.
- Wade who?
- Wade Kingsley, Junior.
- You're sick.
- No, I'm all right.
- You're sick.
No, I'm well! I'm Wade Kingsley, Junior.
Look.
"All right, boys,
get on that posse and ride!"
Wade Kingsley, Junior.
That's what they mean
by a family skeleton, huh?
If your mother sent you here
on account of that broken chair,
- I told her I'd take care of it.
- Oh, no.
My mother doesn't even know I'm here.
I came here to see you myself.
I need help.
You gotta take me out West with you.
You wouldn't last 10 minutes out West.
If you don't take me tonight,
I'm not gonna last five.
- You've never seen Amanda.
- Amanda who?
- The girl I'm gonna marry.
- That's your hard luck.
I'm sorry, there's no chance.
No, wait a minute,
you got to take me with you.
Come on, your father
and my father were pardners.
They died together.
When I'm ready to die,
you can be my pardner.
Oh, we can be pardners.
Well, that's swell.
When I die?
Your friend sure had his heart set on
my bull Cuddles, didn't he?
- Oh, yeah.
- Too bad.
- All right, boys, get Cuddles in the truck.
- Oh, wait a second, sir.
It was really my fault
that Mr Moseley didn't win Cuddles,
- and, well, I'd like to buy her for him.
- "Her"?
Oh, sure. Her.
Well, you save your money for about
and we'll talk business.
No, well, how much does she cost?
"She" costs $7,500.
Oh, I thought she'd be expensive.
All right, you wait here,
I'll go get the money.
No. You want to come with me?
No, well, you don't have to,
you can trust me.
You fellas, don't load her
or don't take her,
because I'll go to the bank, I'll be...
You want...
You better wait here, but I'll be back.
Bye.
Boys, load Cuddles.
Thank you very much, Mrs Martin.
- Hello, Mr Hocker.
- Good afternoon, Mr Kingsley.
- May I help you?
- Yes, I'd be glad to sit there.
Thank you and I'd appreciate
your helping me, Mr Hocker.
I would like to close out
my account, please.
- But you have over $25,000.
- Yes, that's right.
I'm sorry, Mr Kingsley,
but we have standing orders
to get your mother's approval
of any withdrawals you make.
Well, let me just say this, Mr Hocker,
I think that if...
Murrayhill, 1098.
Mr Hocker, what I'm about to say is,
I think Mother will be awfully angry
if you call her.
She's very busy today.
As a matter of fact,
today's one of her busiest days.
- Hello?
- Hello, Mrs Kingsley.
I'm sorry to bother you.
Your son is here.
He wants to close out
his personal account.
What does he need all that money for?
I told you, you shouldn't have
bothered her today, Mr Hocker.
I'll put him on.
Thank you.
Hello, Mother dear.
Well, now, tell me what do you need
all that money for?
Well, it's a surprise, Mother.
Yes, yes, that's it,
I want to buy a surprise.
It isn't a wedding present for Amanda,
is it?
No, it's... Oh, yeah.
Oh, you hit it right on the head
that time, Mama.
Yes, it's a wedding present for Amanda.
How sweet.
Strange as it may seem, Mother dear,
this looks just like Amanda.
Well, here we are, Cuddles.
I'll bet Mr Moseley'll be glad to see us.
Come on in. Come on.
Be careful. Don't hurt yourself.
Come on, follow me.
That's a good bull, come on.
This is gonna be your house.
You'll sleep here and everything.
That's good, Cuddles. Come on.
Hey, wait a minute, Cuddles.
You belong in here, not me.
Hey, we're moving! Westward ho!
Cuddles!
Hello, there!
- I stepped on it.
- Oh, stop it.
- What are you doing here?
- I brought you Cuddles.
- I bought her for the K Ranch.
- That's wonderful! Thanks.
Oh, it's all right.
- No strings attached?
- Oh, no, no strings.
I just figured since it was my fault
that you lost her,
this is the least I could do.
- You know, I had you figured all wrong.
- Thanks a lot. It's nothing. Forget it.
- Oh, I won't forget it.
- Forget it.
- I won't forget it.
- Forget it.
- I won't forget it!
- Forget it!
I won't! Goodbye!
- You leaving?
- You're leaving.
You said
there were no strings attached.
- Yeah, but I only thought that...
- Well, don't thought.
I'm not taking you out West.
Okay, I'll go.
And you can keep Cuddles anyhow.
- Thanks and goodbye.
- Goodbye.
Help!
Oh, help, help!
I said goodbye, the trairs going.
- Help, help! Help!
- No, no!
Help!
Help! Help! Help!
Gee whiz. Thanks a lot.
You saved my life.
That's all right. Forget it.
- No, I won't forget it.
- Forget it.
- I won't forget it.
- I said forget it.
All right. I'll forget it.
- You do everything I say?
- Yeah.
- You get off at the next stop.
- Okay.
Easy, Cuddles. Nice, Cuddles.
You're a good boy, Cuddles.
- Slim, can I do something?
- Yeah, you can do something.
- Oh, water Cuddles.
- What?
- Water Cuddles.
- Oh. Oh, sure.
Here's your water, Cuddles.
- You moved. Should I try it again?
- Don't do nothing.
Just get out. Don't get off, just get out.
Like before I got off the train
and you had to save me
from getting killed when I fell out of it.
"Sincerely yours,
Wade Kingsley, Junior,
"your son."
Here, Cuddles.
Thank you, Cuddles.
The train is slowing down.
Yeah, we're switching over to let
the Eastbound Express have this track.
- You're in luck.
- I am?
Now you're gonna get off here.
- You really want me to go?
- No strings, first stop, remember?
- Yeah. All right.
- My coat.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Well, thanks for the ride and everything.
That's all right.
Cuddles.
Goodbye.
Hey!
Hey, Cuddles, what are you doing here?
You're supposed to be on the train
with Mr Moseley.
He's not gonna like this one bit.
And here he is.
What are you doing with Cuddles?
We werert doing anything, Mr Moseley.
- We were just talking.
- Trying to sneak off with him, huh?
No. I'd have to be an awful big sneak,
and I'm not an Indian giver.
Cuddles is yours, Mr Moseley,
but when I came off the train,
I felt like someone was following me,
and sure enough,
when I turned around...
So long, kid!
Hey, wait! Wait a minute!
Now look what you've done.
We've missed the train.
I'm sorry.
Is that gonna get me back to the ranch?
Well, I tell you what we could do.
- We could first...
- There's no "we."
There's "me" and there's "you,"
and you, I don't want to see any more.
- Yeah, but I thought maybe even...
- Don't thought. It's over.
Goodbye and good luck.
Goodbye, Mr Moseley. Bye, Cuddles.
Bye, everybody.
"And Mother dear, I have the most
wonderful pardner in the world.
"He's what they mean
when they call someone a man.
"He's gonna teach me to ride
and to shoot and be like him.
"You probably
won't even recognise me."
You know, Cuddles, he thinks
I'm the greatest guy in the world,
and I didn't even give that kid a chance.
Come on, Cuddles.
- Good morning!
- You!
Yeah.
It must be pretty hot walking, huh?
Where did you get this outfit?
Oh, a man gave me a lift,
and I bought everything from him.
- He was quite surprised.
- I'll bet he was.
Yeah, I bought the car for you
and the trailer for Cuddles.
And I know you're angry with me,
but would you please let me drive you?
- It will be my pleasure, pardner.
- Well, it'll be my...
Pardner! You really...
You really mean it?
- Certainly. We'll give it a try.
- Oh, that's terrific.
- We'll be just like our dads.
- Just like our dads, yeah.
Here, have some lemonade.
I'll fix up the trailer.
Come on, Cuddles.
Well, this looks like a nice place
to pitch camp.
Yeah, this looks like a very nice place
to pitch camp.
Why?
Well, that's what you said, remember,
you just said...
It makes no difference what I say.
It's what you think.
- Do you like it here?
- I hate it.
- You hate it?
- I changed my mind.
- You see these trees?
- Yeah.
They're to keep the wind off of us.
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.
- Oh, they're just like a tall blanket.
- They're like a tall blanket.
I'm gonna let Cuddles out.
I'm gonna haul some water,
then I'm gonna build a fire.
Oh, let me build the fire. I know how.
Would you let me make the fire?
I know how to make a fire.
Go ahead, make a fire.
- What are you doing?
- I'm getting some sticks for the fire.
Sticks? You got a whole forest there.
- Here, get some twigs over here.
- Oh, all right, I'll get twigs.
- I'll be right back.
- All right. Fine.
Come on, Cuddles.
And I'll get this fire started
while you're gone. He'll be right back?
Is that you, Slim?
Slim?
Moseley!
It's me, Wade.
You got no "yoo" on your "whoo."
- Slim?
- What?
Slim, I'm glad to see you. I missed you.
I was all alone here.
I didn't know where you went.
- You're looking swell.
- I've only been gone 20 seconds.
I'm sorry, but I was awful worried here
all by myself.
I'm trying to get the fire going here,
see?
Rubbing these sticks together.
Don't you think it would be better
with one stick?
- One stick?
- Yeah. Just one.
Well, I didn't know that...
Well, I really should have thought
of that myself. I'm sorry.
You really got your heart set
on being a cowboy, huh?
Oh, yeah, my heart's set on it,
but my stomach's a little shaky.
All right. Come on,
let's get the stuff out of the car.
I'll help you, Slim. Let me do it.
I'll get the stuff out of the car for you.
I'll have all the things that we need
right here.
You know,
you're gonna be all right, Wade.
- Really?
- Yeah.
You and I are gonna get along
together fine.
You mean we?
You and me
We're gonna be pardners
You and me, we're gonna be pals
You and me, we'll do and dare alike
We'll share what there's to share alike
That goes for money, whisky and gals
You and me
we'll be the greatest pardners
Buddies and pals
You and me, we're gonna be pardners
You and me, we're gonna be pals
You and me, when other friendships fail
We'll still be on that long, long trail
That leads up to those pearly corrals
Up in the sky
You and me
we'll be the greatest pardners
Buddies and pals
You and me
we'll be the greatest pardners
Buddies and pals
I'll teach you how to draw
Without a hitch or flaw
You'll draw just like your famous pa
- Who, me?
- Watch.
I got it.
Don't you think it'd be better with a gun?
Are we still pardners?
All right, we're still pardners.
Here, get the rope.
The fastest antelope
That sees you with a rope
Will know there just ain't any hope
- No hope at all.
- Come here.
Yeah.
- Give me room.
- Give me room. Room.
All right, grab the rope in the right hand.
- In the right hand, yeah.
- All right.
- And the rest in the left hand.
- The rest in the left hand.
- Spread your feet.
- Spread.
- All right, now, make a loop.
- Make a loop.
- Make a loose loop.
- A loose loop.
- Take it back slow.
- How do I take that back?
- Slow.
- Oh, slow.
Okay, go!
Hey, come here.
Did you ever ride a horse?
Well, my mother had an electric horse
that I used to ride all the time,
- but I never rode a real horse.
- Come here.
Yeah.
- There's a horse.
- Oh, hello, nice horse.
- It has hard skin, this horse.
- Yeah.
Put your hand here.
- All right, put your foot in my hand.
- Yeah.
Up we go!
You can't ride a horse.
You can't spin a rope.
It's a cinch you can't use guns.
You're impossible.
All right. Come on, let's bed down.
You and me
We'll be the greatest pardners
Buddies and pals
You and me
We'll be the greatest pardners
Buddies and pals
All right, let's get some sleep.
We'll try again in the morning.
Oh, thanks a lot. Here, I'll cover you up.
It's cold out here at night
in the open air.
This is Carson Valley.
And over here, that's the K Ranch.
Oh, the K Ranch.
I've been dreaming about that
ever since I was a little kid.
I can't wait to get there.
Look, I wouldn't be so anxious
if I were you.
What do you mean?
If the masked raiders ever find out
that your name is Kingsley,
- they'll string you up to the nearest post.
- They would?
Yeah, they would. I'll tell you what.
We'll call you Killer Jones.
I'll take a chance
they don't find out and kill you.
Oh, well, thanks a lot, Slim.
I certainly appreciate that.
And I sure enough like a guy
that's not afraid to take a chance.
- What was that?
- It must be the masked raiders.
The masked raiders?
- Maybe we can catch 'em.
- Yeah. I think I'll walk.
Hold tight.
We'll never catch 'em now, Killer.
Killer?
Slim!
- I'm so glad you're here.
- Relax, sweetheart.
Everything's gonna be all right.
- Any damage, Rio?
- I don't know.
I was just going out
to check the west fence.
Well, this is the first time
they've struck in broad daylight.
They must be desperate.
Did you get a good look at any of 'em?
Wish I had.
But they was all wearing masks.
There's gonna be a mass meeting
in town tomorrow.
Cuddles.
- How did you get him?
- You can thank Killer Jones for that.
Hey, look. Look what's in here.
Is the shooting over?
Yeah, the shooting's all over.
You can come out now, Killer.
Killer?
- Put Cuddles in the barn, huh, fellas?
- Sure, Slim.
Hello.
- You were at the rodeo.
- Yes, ma'am.
Looks like some deck's missing a joker.
So you're gun-shy, eh?
I'll bet you dance real pretty.
- No, I can't!
- All right, Rio!
All right, all right! No, no, no more.
I'm dancing, I'm dancing.
That's enough, Rio. That's enough.
Well, we're just having some fun.
What are you, his mother?
No, go ahead and check the west fence.
- You're the foreman. I just work here.
- That's right. I'm the foreman.
- Thanks for sticking up for me.
- That's okay.
- I'm awful sorry about what happened.
- Oh, that's all right.
I'm gonna have to learn
to take care of myself anyhow.
I told Killer that we might be able to use
an extra hand around here.
Well, I guess we can.
Oh, that's wonderful!
Thank you very much.
Here, you can have 'em both.
What I mean to say is, I'll work.
I'll do everything. You'll see.
You won't be sorry.
- Well, then good luck.
- Thank you, Miss Kingsley.
Oh, by the way,
may I just say one thing?
Sure.
You... You mustang! You...
- Moseley's back.
- You told me he wasrt due till tonight.
He wasrt.
He was supposed to come in
on the train.
He brought somebody with him.
- The law?
- No. Some joker called Killer Jones.
With Slim back,
you better lay low for a while.
We can't lay low.
The government needs this
whole valley for the new power dam.
It's either all or nothing.
If we don't get control of the K Ranch,
we're lost.
- How much time we got?
- One week.
Come on.
How about a piece of pie, honey?
- Some fresh coffee?
- No, thank... No, thank you.
Look, honey, a falling star. Here.
Make a wish.
- It wouldn't do any good.
- Oh, why don't you try?
All right.
I hope the bank believes in falling stars.
We don't need the bank
with a moon like that.
- No?
- No, look.
We don't need to swing in a hammock
We don't need the nightingale's tune
All we need to get going
Is me 'r you 'r the moon
We don't need a heavenly setting
We don't need a sleepy lagoon
All we need to get going
Is me 'r you 'r the moon
Just the three of us
What a situation
Just the three of us, plus
A natural inclination
Oh, we don't need a flowery season
Love is love December or June
We can make our own weather
Just put us together
Me 'r you 'r the moon
We don't need a comfortable parlour
We don't need a phonograph tune
All we need to get goir is
Me 'r you 'r the moon
We don't need a horse and a buggy
Buggy rides are over too soon
All we need to get goir is
Me 'r you 'r the moon
Just the three of us
What a pleasure this is
Just the three of us, plus
A couple of thousand kisses
We don't need a flowery season
Love is love December or June
We can make our own weather
Just put us together
Me 'r you 'r the moon
Me, you and the moon
Come in.
- Oh, good morning, Miss Kingsley.
- Good morning.
- Slim told me all about you.
- He did?
- So you're Cousin Wade, huh?
- Oh, that. Oh, yes, ma'am.
But I wouldn't like for it to get around.
- Don't worry. I'll keep your secret.
- Thank you very much.
And you're welcome to stay on here
as long as you like, Cousin.
Thank you very much.
It's nice here, and you're wonderful.
- Oh, it's all right, we're cousins.
- You're not kissing cousins.
- No.
- Come on, we'd better get going.
I got to get to the town meeting
when it starts.
- Are all the boys going?
- Yes.
- Me, too?
- Certainly. You're one of the boys now.
Oh, boy.
And I better get you a gun,
because we may have a little trouble.
- I think I better take my nap now.
- Here's a gun that belonged to your dad.
It has "Wade" right on it.
- For me?
- For you.
Oh, thank you.
- I'll wear this gun proudly for you, Dad.
- Okay.
I'll make you proud you got a son,
Wade, Junior, Dad.
Well, come along, boy,
the meeting's starting.
Come along, Cousin.
Are you coming, Slim?
Wow!
Come on, Killer!
All right, let's go.
Whoa, whoa, now. Nice...
Oh, boy. Good boy.
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.
Wait up! Here, nice horse!
Wait, wait, horse. Come here.
You got to wait for me, horse.
Well, now that you know
who the master is,
I don't suppose
we'll need this any longer.
Help! Help! Horse! Horse!
Runaway! Runaway! Help!
I'll see you in town. Come on, Buck.
- Need any help, honey?
- Why don't you stick to your cows?
Now, that's where you're making
a mistake. I'm not just a cowhand.
- I'm gonna be rich.
- Well, good.
You can buy yourself a new personality.
- Help!
- It's a runaway!
Stop 'em! Stop 'em!
Help! Help!
Help! Help!
Help! Help!
Stop! Help! Help!
Help! Stop!
- Help! Help!
- Help! Whoa!
Help! Help!
Stop them! Stop them!
- Stop them! Stop them!
- Gee, you drive awful fast for a girl.
- I think I'll get off at the next corner.
- I can't stop them!
You can't? I think I'll get off right here.
I stopped them. I stopped them!
Nice horsie! Oh, I'm a hero!
Look at me, everybody!
I stopped them all by myself!
I stopped them.
It's all right. You can wake up now.
I stopped the horses.
- Everything is fine now.
- It's all over?
Oh, yeah, I stopped the horses.
I just had to show 'em
who the boss was.
You're the bravest man I've ever known.
It wasrt anything.
- But you could have been killed!
- Yeah, I know.
- Thank you.
- We'd better get back to town.
Yeah, I guess so.
Giddyap!
Quiet!
Now, men, most of you
have already had trouble.
Your homes have been burnt
and your stock's been run off.
We need a new sheriff.
Let's get a good one.
We can't afford to wait any longer.
We must act now.
- What have we got a sheriff for?
- The sheriff can't do it alone.
He needs us behind him.
It's election time again.
They just killed the new sheriff.
- Mr Hollis, could you...
- I probably have more to lose
because of the masked raiders
than any man in this room.
I've been a banker in this community
for a good many years.
If these raids keep up,
my bank is going to be ruined.
Now, we need a sheriff who's not afraid
of these blood-thirsty killers.
- Well, I wouldn't...
- Someone who'll stand up
- to these cutthroats.
- Well, I'd like to...
I'm not finished yet, Slim.
A man who is fearless and unafraid.
- Well, I'm not...
- There must be one among us
who is not afraid to die
for our community.
You're right, Mr Hollis!
Here he is!
I told you he'd bring her back safe!
Hold them horses!
Stranger, we're proud to welcome
you to town.
'Twarrt nothing.
- Are you all right, Dolly?
- Yes, fine. Just a little bit shaken up.
- He stopped the runaway.
- Aw, 'twarrt nothing.
We were all scared silly.
Come on,
we'll get you into a nice hot tub.
- You'll feel better.
- All right.
Goodbye. And thank you.
- Let's take him into the meeting.
- Oh, well, wait.
Oh, I'm sore. Wait, be careful.
Wait, wait, sore.
Will someone raise his hand?
Will someone raise his hand?
You should have seen him.
He stopped a runaway.
- Leaped right into the jaws of death!
- There's a volunteer!
Bravest man I ever seen.
- Yeah. He's one of our boys now.
- Nice work.
Welcome, stranger. What's your name?
- My name is Wade...
- Killer Jones.
- Killer Jones.
- I'm proud to know you.
Killer Jones?
Thank you very much.
Well, you're just the kind of man
we need.
- You don't mean him? You can't do that.
- Why not?
- Yeah, why not?
- He's a busy man.
- No, I'm not busy.
- They want to make you sheriff.
They do?
The town needs a man
with your courage, Killer.
- You don't want to be sheriff.
- Oh, yes, I do.
- You don't.
- I do.
- No, you don't!
- I do!
- You see, he wants the job.
- Yes, I do.
All in favour of Killer Jones for the
new sheriff of Carson Valley say "Aye."
Aye!
- Opposed, "Nay."
- Nay!
- Nay!
- You sore loser!
This is Tom's. No sense wasting it.
- What happened to Tom?
- He retired.
- Congratulations, Sheriff.
- Thank you very much.
Oh, there's a hole in this.
Tom wasrt very neat.
- Well, you want to congratulate me?
- No. I don't want to congratulate you.
Why, because you don't think
I know how to sheriff?
- That's right.
- Yeah. Well, I'll show you.
Good. Show me. Now that you're sheriff,
show me your first move.
Well,
the first thing I'm gonna do as sheriff
is make you my deputy sheriff.
You're fired.
Are you sure
you know what you're doing?
Oh, yes, Miss Kingsley. Don't worry.
This won't interfere
with my work at the ranch.
- It won't?
- Well, no.
Because I can do all the little things
a sheriff is supposed to do,
like no double-parking horses
and no throwing paper in the streets,
in my spare time.
I didn't know it was this easy.
That's probably because
you've never been sheriff.
- No, I never was.
- That's the difference.
You see, son, you're talking to a sheriff!
I told you, you were fired!
Now go on, get going.
Slim!
Slim.
Boss, I got to hand it to you.
That's the dumbest sheriff
we've ever had.
I want to keep this one.
The others were too smart
and too dangerous.
As long as this idiot's sheriff,
we're safe.
That's for certain.
What about tonight?
Pass the word
we're hitting the K Ranch.
- Come on, I'll set 'em up.
- Right.
I don't think we can afford
any more men, Slim.
- Hi, Dolly.
- Hello, Dolly.
Who are you helloing, you two-bit,
blowhard, weak-headed jackass?
Come on, I want to dance with you.
- Which one of me?
- Any one of you.
Why'd you say
all those mean things to me over there?
Mean? Those were compliments.
If I ever told you
what I really think of you,
it would singe your hair off.
Then, what I don't understand is,
why did you want to dance with me?
Because I think I'm in love with you.
You idiot!
Why did you let them talk you
into becoming sheriff?
Is that all you're mad about?
Looks like your hen found herself
another rooster.
Get ready to see
some chicken fricassee.
- We'd better stop dancing.
- Why? I like it.
You better not talk to me any more.
Please run. He'll kill you.
Who... Oh, that's impossible.
I'm the sheriff.
Leave him alone, Rio.
He didn't mean any harm.
Who told you
you could dance with Dolly?
Since when do I have to answer
to anybody?
Do you realise I'm the sheriff?
Please, Rio, please!
Don't you know it ain't nice
to push ladies around?
You're not a lady.
It's too sharp.
- You pushed me.
- Yeah?
Well, I push you!
- I'll put a stop to this.
- Don't, Carol. He's the sheriff.
It won't help him.
You're right. He needs help.
Come on.
No, this isn't good. How's this side?
No, no, no. Wait, wait.
Okay. That's good. Okay, now!
I'm gonna kill you with these two hands.
Wait, couldn't we just talk
for one second?
- Where are you?
- Here I am.
It's Rio!
Pick him up
and bring him over to the bar.
Yeah.
Wade!
Wake up! Wake up, Wade!
Easy, easy! Wade, this is Slim!
I'm on your side.
- What happened? Where's Rio?
- You knocked him out.
- I did?
- Sure you did.
Well, I guess that'll learn him
not to tangle with the sheriff, huh?
That's right. Now, go in there
and take charge, Sheriff!
- I'm gonna kill him.
- You'll do no such thing.
I told you we need him.
You're not going to lay a finger on him.
- I can't let him get away with this!
- Don't worry!
When the time comes,
you can take care of him.
Anyone who touches him
answers to me. Is that clear?
- Yeah.
- All right.
Anything you say.
Why, you...
- I ought...
- Come here.
I believe you owe this young lady
an apology.
You behaved very badly, you know.
- It's all right, Killer. Forget it.
- But he wants to apologise, don't you?
Take off your hat. Take it off!
That's better. Now, say you're sorry.
- Sorry.
- I can't hear you.
- I'm sorry.
- Speak up, boy!
- I'm sorry!
- Don't you yell at me!
- Now, get down on one knee.
- Nobody talks to me like that!
I do, and make it both knees!
I'm sorry.
You don't look very good short.
Stand up.
You don't look very pretty tall, either.
Try it on one foot.
I'm sorry.
- The other foot.
- I'm sorry!
- Try it with both feet in air!
- That's impossible!
- You're not trying!
- I'm sorry!
There, that wasrt so hard, was it?
All you have to do is force yourself.
But there's something missing yet.
Lean on the table.
Put one hand on the table and lean.
And raise that foot!
I don't believe this.
That's very good. Now, dance!
Dance! Dance! Very good!
Very good! That was perfect.
Now, it's all a question
of good manners, isn't it?
Isn't it?
Yes, sir.
It's just a question of good manners.
Fine. Now take a walk. Wait a minute!
Take a walk
and take that walk backwards!
- Now we got a real sheriff.
- We sure have!
Come on, Sheriff, let's celebrate!
Come on, Dolly, have a drink.
How about making a speech, Sheriff?
Well, I wouldn't know what to talk about.
- Killer.
- Yeah?
Well, there's nothing wrong in that,
that's no crime.
And I ain't ashamed, neither.
Sure, I'm sweet on Dolly.
- Why?
- Oh, I don't know.
I reckon because she's a gal
and I'm a guy,
and, well,
there's a lot of things about Dolly I like.
She rides like a feather
She looks good in leather
Her horse is all that she thinks of
But she's my buckskin beauty
buckskin beauty
The only gal I'll ever love
- Love
- Love
She sure loves to battle
with a herd of cattle
And cactus is her favourite flower
But she's my buckskin beauty
buckskin beauty
A-blooming sweeter by the hour
Hour
Hour
When she came to woo me
She lassoed and threw me
'Cause that was the lady's style
And then she demanded
That we both get branded
and walk right down the aisle
But I hate to marry so I didn't tarry
But I took off like a frightened dove
But she's my buckskin beauty
buckskin beauty
The only gal I'll ever love
Goodbye, my buckskin beauty
buckskin beauty
The only gal I'll ever love
Love
Love
Slim, the masked raiders
are on their way to the K Ranch.
The K Ranch?
The masked raiders,
they're on their way to the K Ranch!
Let's go.
The masked raiders? The K Ranch?
- You better get the sheriff.
- You're the sheriff.
- I think it's time for my nap.
- Stop fooling around.
We gotta get to the K Ranch!
Well, I can't go anywhere
until you put me down.
Come on, men, we need a posse!
Let's go! Quick!
This way.
Slim.
You'd better hurry up.
We got to get out there.
They'll have every...
- Come on, Sheriff, let's ride.
- Yeah.
Come on, Buck.
- Good luck, Sheriff.
- Thanks, Dolly.
I'm riding.
Come on, boy, ride 'em.
Ride 'em!
A masked raider! Geronimo!
I got a masquerader!
I got... I caught a masquerader!
I got one of them. I got one of them!
I'll take him in. I'll bring him in to jail.
I got him. I caught him. I got him!
Stand back! I got a masked raider!
Here, right here! I got a masked...
Carol! Carol! Carol!
I got a masked raider.
I caught him myself. Right by the barn.
He had a flame in his hand,
and he was burning up the whole place,
but I walked behind him,
I stalked him and I held the gun on him,
and I caught him myself!
All alone, I caught... Slim.
Not you, Slim! Not my buddy and pal!
My pardner, one of the masked raiders.
Shame on you.
Shame, shame,
you criminal outlaw, you!
You're gonna have to hand in
your badge.
I hate to do this, but it's my duty.
- Hand it in, boy. Hand it in.
- Why don't you stop it?
I'm no masked raider.
But I saw you with the fire.
That's why I...
Sure did a good job here, didn't they?
Go get 'em!
They cut the west fence
and stampeded the herd.
- He was standing...
- Looks like they got clean away.
We'll see if we can round up your cattle,
Miss Carol.
I grabbed him
because he had the flame.
- Thanks very much.
- The torch was burning and so what...
Will you forget the torch
and clean up the porch?
It's like a joke, "Forget the torch
and clean up the porch."
But let me explain,
you see, if you didn't have the fire...
- Clean up the porch!
- All right.
- Hello, Slim.
- Hi.
Hello, Carol.
Well, welcome to what's left
of the K Ranch.
Oh, we're not licked yet.
If Mr Hollis will give an extension
on the note, we can...
I usually discuss business
with the people concerned.
What happens to Carol is my concern.
- Well, I...
- Please, Slim.
- Let me talk to Dan alone.
- Sure. Excuse me.
- I'm very sorry about all this, Carol.
- Why did it have to happen now?
You know, you need a man
to take care of this ranch for you.
A husband. I'm very fond of you, Carol.
I can offer a wife a great deal.
I'm asking you to marry me, Carol.
Well, thank you, Dan. I'm flattered,
but I'm going to marry Slim.
- Where will you and Slim live?
- Well, here, of course.
- I intend to hold on to the ranch.
- Your note's due on Monday.
My board of directors
want that note paid.
I've stalled them off as long as I can.
Now, I'm afraid
it's gonna have to be paid.
But I can't raise $15,000 by Monday.
Well, maybe
Slim can think of something.
- Goodbye, Dan.
- Goodbye, Carol.
- I'd like to see Mr Hollis, please.
- Just a minute. I'll call him.
Thank you.
They want me inside. I'll be right back.
He wants to see you.
- Well, what can I do for you, Sheriff?
- How are you, Mr Hollis?
I would like to pay off the note
on the K Ranch.
Now, where did you get
this kind of money?
Well, it's mine. Let me explain.
I'm sure I can trust you.
- I'm Wade Kingsley.
- Wade Kingsley?
- Junior.
- Junior?
Certainly. You remember.
Your father and my father
werert very good friends, were they?
- Oh, no, they werert.
- No.
- But time heals all wounds, doesn't it?
- Yes.
Well, there you are, Mr Hollis.
There's the money,
and I will take the note, please.
You keep this. I'll go and get the note
for you, Mr Kingsley.
Junior?
- Killer.
- Oh, Killer.
Yeah.
Get going.
You're going to rob this bank.
What?
Our sheriff is out there with $15,000
to pay off the note on the K Ranch.
If we lose the K Ranch,
we lose our whole set-up.
Right. So hurry.
- And, Rio.
- Yeah?
- Now you can take care of the sheriff.
- It'll be a pleasure.
- They're getting the note for you.
- Thank you very much, Mr Hollis.
Here you are.
You keep it
while they're getting the note.
That's good business.
Well, it certainly is nice
dealing with someone you can trust.
Thank you.
- The masked raiders!
- Everybody, get down.
Turn around
and keep your faces to the walls.
Where is he? Where's the sheriff?
Shut up!
No peeking. Turn around.
Don't worry, ma'am. It's me, the sheriff.
- Where's the sheriff?
- He must have got away.
- Here's the money.
- Hang onto this, Gus.
- I'll guard it like it was my very own.
- All right, let's get out of here.
It's me! But don't worry.
I'll be with them every minute.
- What happened?
- The masked raiders held up my bank.
- And the sheriff went with 'em.
- The sheriff?
Come on, Buck.
We lost them, boy.
Turn around,
we have to take the money back!
You're not paying attention!
- Come on, Gus!
- We got out of there just in time.
Yeah, they were sure throwing lead
at us.
It was easier than I thought it'd be.
You know what I'm gonna do
with my share?
Come on, Gus, you got the dough.
Put it on the table.
Let's split it up, huh?
How do we split it up?
- We got plenty this time.
- Yeah, I want my share right now.
I do the counting.
Where's your manners?
Take off that mask.
- Oh, it's a little chilly in here.
- I said take off that mask.
You wouldn't like it. I'm very ugly.
- You! Killer Jones.
- Killer Jones!
That was a pretty good holdup
we just pulled off, wasrt it?
- So Gus got it, huh?
- Yes, he did. You see, he...
Where do you want it?
Well, couldn't we just talk quietly
for a moment?
I said, where do you want it?
Well, this would be a good place
right here.
- Let me finish him off.
- All right.
- Let's kill him now.
- Kill me? I didn't do anything.
No? Look, put yourself in my place.
No!
- You go out to rob a bank...
- I do?
- You're with your buddies.
- My pals.
Right. You rush the bank.
We ain't a-scared of anything?
You get the money
and you get out of there.
- They're trying to kill you.
- Help!
You get on your horse
and you ride away.
They'll never catch us now.
Suddenly, you find
you've got a spy among you!
A spy!
The dirty rat!
- Would you shoot him?
- Shooting is too good for him.
What would you do?
I'd tie that dirty rat in that chair
and I'd gag his mouth!
Then I'd stick two sticks of dynamite,
each one in a back pocket,
and I'd light one at a time,
and I'd wait to see him blow to bits.
That's good enough for me.
Tie him to the chair, boys!
Wait a minute. I'm not a dirty rat!
No, wait. No, wait.
- Yes, you are.
- Oh, my leg.
Easy, easy. Wait. Wait. All right.
I'm sitting.
That's fine. The dynamite's in the box
with the powder.
If you blow me up, I'll tell Miss Kingsley
and she'll be pretty mad,
and you'll get fired
because she and I are friends.
Shut up!
Come on, hurry up.
All right, who wants to go first?
Take it easy, Killer!
You wanted to be sheriff. You're sheriff.
All of you, drop your gun belts.
Move slow.
Nobody's leaving!
But you don't understand.
We got to get...
Save it!
You'll do all your talking in town.
- That'll be too late.
- I said save it. Get over there. Over.
All of you! Get over!
And to think Carol trusted you, Rio.
You're a real one-man band.
All right, you're safe, I'm here, Sheriff.
Let's get out of here!
There's dynamite in his pockets!
Dynamite in his pockets?
Let's get out of here!
Come on!
Wake up! Slim, there's...
Slim! Slim, wake up! Wake up, Slim!
Slim, wake up!
Slim, Slim!
Slim! Wait, wait.
Wait, wait.
- Slim! Slim!
- Where did...
Slim, let's get out of here.
There's dynamite, it's gonna blow up.
- There's what?
- There's dynamite. It's gonna blow up.
- I'll see you.
- Take me with you!
Take me with you! Hurry up! Hurry up!
Slim! Cutting... Be careful. That's it.
That's it. Hurry. There's dynamite!
Cut this.
- This is gonna be a big one!
- What's gonna be?
- Wade.
- Oh, is that where they were?
Gimme these things! Get down!
Run! Get behind the rock!
- Boy, are we lucky.
- I should say so.
And are you lucky that you didn't
get hurt when Hollis hit you!
- Hollis?
- He's the one that hit you.
- So, he's the leader of the gang.
- Yeah.
- Come on, let's go.
- Where are we going?
- We're gonna round 'em up.
- Without guns or horses?
- I'll carry you.
- Oh, well, thank you. That'll be good.
- Then I won't feel too bad.
- Comfortable?
- Yeah.
- Get down and walk.
You said you'd carry me!
That's why I got on you, 'cause you...
We have been troubled
by masked raiders for some time,
We have been troubled
by masked raiders for some time,
not knowing who they were.
And we've all been fooled.
I have proof that Slim Moseley
is head of the masked raiders.
- And Killer Jones is his lieutenant.
- I don't believe it.
- Neither do I.
- It was hard for me to believe, too.
But why else do you think
they ran away?
They knew I was on to 'em.
Hurry up! We don't want to be late
for the meeting.
- It's the sheriff and Slim.
- Let's get 'em.
Let's make sure this time.
Let's ride 'em.
Don't let 'em get away!
What are we gonna do now?
Hurry up. They're coming.
Hurry up, Slim! Hurry up!
Now, get up.
You. Get up. Hold on.
Get going. Get over there.
Get over there, all of you.
- Get in there!
- Throw your guns out here.
- You in there, Al?
- Here you are, Sheriff.
- All right, fellas, where's Hollis?
- Where's Hollis?
Hollis is over at the K Ranch.
He's electing a new sheriff.
- He wouldn't dare!
- All right, get 'em in jail!
- Inside! Get going.
- Get in! All right, in!
Now, we have to elect a new sheriff,
someone we can trust. Like Rio here.
- Rio? Fine!
- Someone we can trust! Rio?
Well, look! It's Slim!
- And the Killer!
- Hold it!
Everybody, hands up!
Get over there, get on the wall!
Everybody! Fast!
- It's too quiet.
- It's too quiet.
- Something's wrong.
- Something's wrong.
- I'll go first.
- You go first.
- You cover me.
- I'll cover you.
- I'll take Hollis and you take Rio.
- You take Rio.
- You take Rio!
- Yeah, I'll take Rio.
Keep your hand on the gun.
If they make a move, let 'em have it.
Wade, will you stop fooling around?
That gun might go off.
Gun?
Where'd you get two guns?
Let 'em have it, Wade! Wade!
Drop your guns.
- Where's the sheriff?
- I wish I knew!
The sheriff must be close by.
Get him, Rio. Now, move!
I've waited a long time for this.
This'll square everything!
Drop it, Hollis!
Just in the nick of time, huh, Slim?
Pretty good!
Everybody stay where you are.
Don't move, Sheriff.
Now, give me that gun.
All right, Rio, get up! On your feet.
- Up! I've suspected you for a long time.
- Get over there with your buddy!
There's the leader
of the masked raiders, Mr Hollis.
All right, take 'em down to the
hoosegow with the rest of the gang.
- Let's go, Rio.
- Come on, Hollis, let's go.
Oh, Slim, I'm so proud of you.
I'm so proud I'm busting my buttons.
They're pardners, they're pardners
They're pardners, pardners, pardners
buddies and pals
You and me, we're gonna be pardners
Slim and Wade
They're gonna be pals
Wade and Slim
They'll do and dare alike
They'll share what there's to share alike
That goes for money, whisky and gals
You and me
we'll be the greatest pardners
Buddies and pals
We're not ready for "The End" yet.
We have something to say to you.
Right, Dean?
We sure do, Jer.
We want you folks to know
we sure enjoyed working for you,
and we hope you enjoyed the picture.
Yeah, and we hope you'll keep coming
to see us,

- So long.
Goodbye. Now, "The End." Not that way!
That's better!

we'll be the greatest pardners
