WHAT IS THIS PLACE?
LOOKS LIKE A GRAVEYARD.
THAT'S 'CAUSE HONEST FOLKS
GO TO BED EARLY.
NO KIDDIN'.
HOW MUCH MONEY YOU GOT?
I GOT SIX BITS,
BUT I NEED TO EAT.
I GOT A DOLLAR, JACK,
BUT I GOTTA TAKE A BATH.
LOOKS LIKE 11 CENTS.
FORK IT OVER.
WHAT?
COME ON,
THAT'S NOT FAIR.
HERE YOU GO.
I'M GOING TO USE THIS
TO GET US SOME REAL MONEY.
COME ON, AT LEAST
LEAVE US ENOUGH FOR A BEER.

IF I SIT IN FOR A COUPLE?
COME AHEAD.
WE GO NICKEL AND
DEEP BUCK LIMIT HERE.
OPEN.

CALL.
CARDS.

YOU LADS LOOK LIKE EXPRESS
GUARDS, WEARING SIDE
ARMS AND ALL.
THREE.
WE'RE DROVERS.
DEALER TAKES THREE
AND BETS A SHORT BID.

I SEE THAT,
AND RAISE TWO MORE.
HE'S GOT CARDS,
THAT'S THEIR WHOLE POKE.
SEE BET.

HEELER COUNTY?
LOVELY COUNTRY, THAT.

THE CONGRESS MINE.

LIKELY CATCH HELL
WHEN WE GET BACK.
I'M GONNA RAISE

THE OLD WOMAN WILL
HAVE MY HEAD. SEE THAT.
THAT'S FOUR BITS TO YOU.
FULL HOUSE.
KINGS OVER DEUCES.
HOW ABOUT YOU?
WHAT'D YOU DO THAT FOR?
DON'T TOUCH ME, PLEASE!
GET THE MONEY.
JUDAS PRIEST!
THEY WERE CHEATIN' ME.
I'M NOT TO BE TRIFLED WITH.
I KNOWED THEM BOYS.

THEY NEVER CHEATED NOBODY.
COME ON, WE GOTTA
GET OUT OF HERE.
THERE MUST BE $15 HERE!
COME ON,
BEFORE SOMEBODY COMES!
YOU DIRTY,
ROTTEN BASTARDS!
SHUT UP, WHORE!
WHAT DO YOU
THINK YOU'RE DOING?
YOU THINK YOU'RE
TOUGHER THAN ME?
YOU'RE NOT ANYTHING.
YOU PEOPLE LISTEN TO ME.
THEM MEN WERE
CHEATING ME.
AND I'M NOT
TO BE TRIFLED WITH.
I'M A DANITE.
AND I'LL AVENGE MYSELF
ON THE GENTILE
ANYTIME HE CROSSES ME.
SO WHEN THE LAW
COMES, YOU TELL 'EM.
TELL 'EM I'M NOT
TO BE FOOLED WITH.
TOM.
SIR.
YOU GREW UP, SIR.
I SUPPOSE I DID.
GIVE ME THAT.
WE RUN 3,000 HEAD
ON 50,000 ACRES.
NICE SIZE. HOUSE IS ABOUT
A MILE UP THE ROAD.
I HOPE IT HAS BEDS.
YEAH. NEW PRIVIES, TOO.
JUST DUG 'EM.
THAT'S NICE TO KNOW.
YOU'LL LIKE LOTTIE.
SHE'S GOOD PEOPLE.
I'M LOOKING FORWARD
TO MEETING HER.
SHE'S A HELL OF A COOK.
IS THIS HIM?
THIS IS LOTTIE.
HOW DO YOU DO?
IT IS SO GOOD
TO MEET YOU!
HE IS JUST BEAUTIFUL!
YOUR DADDY HAS TOLD ME
SO MUCH ABOUT YOU,
I FEEL LIKE
I ALREADY KNOW YOU.
I BELIEVE HE'S TALLER
THAN YOU ARE.
SMARTER, TOO.
I DOUBT IT.
WHAT ARE WE DOING OUT HERE?
LET'S GO INSIDE.
I BET YOU CAN
FIRE THIS A MILE.
YOU ALWAYS DID
ADMIRE THAT SHARPS.
SHOOTS TRUE TO 1,000 YARDS.
GENERAL CROOK GAVE IT TO ME.
I NEVER DID UNDERSTAND
THAT NAME HE GAVE ME, THOUGH.
"NEMESIS." NEMESIS
WAS THE GOD
OF RETRIBUTION.
HUNTED DOWN AND
PUNISHED THE WICKED.
COLLEGE MAN.
LAWYER, TOO.
WITH YOUR EDUCATION, THERE'S NO
LIMIT TO WHAT YOU CAN DO HERE.
REALLY PUT THIS PLACE
ON THE MAP.
IT'S GOOD TO HAVE
YOU HOME. I MISSED YOU.
IT'S GOOD TO
BE BACK, SIR.
YOU LIKE LOTTIE?
YES, I DO.
SHE'LL NEVER
TAKE YOUR MOM'S PLACE.
NO. I LIKE HER
VERY MUCH.
THAT REMINDS ME,
I GOT SOMETHING FOR YOU.
YOUR MOTHER GAVE ME THIS
JUST BEFORE WE WERE MARRIED.
THOUGHT YOU MIGHT
LIKE TO HAVE IT.
THANK YOU.
SHE CERTAINLY WAS BEAUTIFUL.
SHE WAS THE PRETTIEST
WOMAN I EVER SAW.
TAKE YOUR BREATH AWAY.
SHE COULD SING,
PLAY THE SPINET,
RECITE POETRY.
GOD KNOWS WHAT
SHE EVER SAW IN ME.
SHE FOLLOWED YOU
OUT HERE, SIR.
IT'S AWFUL TO THINK
OF HER DYING SO YOUNG.
THIS IS A HARD LIFE OUT HERE.
SOMETIMES I WONDER IF MAYBE
SHE JUST WASN'T CUT OUT FOR IT.
THERE'S SOMETHING I'VE BEEN--
DINNER'S ON THE TABLE!
WE BETTER GO.
MAKE A FUSS OVER DINNER.
SHE'S BEEN WORKING
AT IT ALL DAY.
'EVENING.
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?
WE WAS WONDERING IF
WE COULD REST OUR HORSES.
MAYBE GET A BITE TO EAT.
THE WOMAN'S GOT A STEW ON.
'EVENING, MA'AM.
GOOD EVENING.
SOMETHING SURE SMELLS
GOOD IN THERE.
THANK YOU!
I'LL HAVE YOUR SIDE ARMS.
IT'S A HOUSE RULE HERE.
YES, SIR. CAN'T BE TOO
CAREFUL THESE DAYS.
WHERE YOU FELLERS FROM?
DOWN HEELER COUNTY.
WE'RE DROVERS.
I GOT A HORSE HERE,
MIGHT HAVE A LOOSE SHOE.
WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK?
THINK HE'LL NEED A NEW ONE?
'MORNING, COME ON IN.
'MORNING, SIR.
LOOK AT YOU.
STARTING TO LOOK
LIKE YOURSELF AGAIN.
YOU BUILT
REAL BUSY RIGHT NOW?
HELL, NO. THIS PAPERWORK
IS ABOUT TO SOUR MY STOMACH.
MAYBE I CAN TAKE
A LOOK AT IT FOR YOU.
I WISH YOU WOULD.
EVEN WHEN YOU WERE LITTLE,
YOU WERE ALWAYS READING.
I CAN REMEMBER LOOKING
IN ON YOU AT MIDNIGHT
AND YOUR LAMP
WOULD STILL BE BURNING.
BUT YOU'D HIDE YOUR
BOOK UNDER THE COVERS
AND PRETEND YOU WERE ASLEEP.
HOW'D YOU KNOW
I WAS PRETENDING?
I'D FEEL YOUR FOREHEAD.
EVER SINCE YOU WERE A BABY,
WHEN YOU WERE REALLY ASLEEP
YOU'D GET A LITTLE
BEAD OF SWEAT RIGHT THERE.
SIR, I'VE GOT TO TALK TO YOU.
FIRE AWAY.
I HOPE YOU UNDERSTAND
I'M VERY GRATEFUL
FOR EVERYTHING YOU'VE DONE.
PAYING FOR MY EDUCATION
AND EVERYTHING.
IT WAS MY PLEASURE.
I'M NOT GONNA
BE STAYING HERE.
YOU'RE NOT?
NO, I'M GOING BACK
TO PHILADELPHIA.
UNCLE FLETCHER'S OFFERED
ME A POSITION
AT HIS LAW FIRM
AS A JUNIOR PARTNER.
HERE.
SEE WHERE IT'S GOT
MY NAME AND EVERYTHING.
IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU'RE ALL SETTLED IN.
IT'S NOT LIKE WE'LL NEVER
SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN.
I'LL HAVE HOLIDAYS
AND WHEN I GET TIME--
LISTEN, A MAN'S GOT TO
GO HIS OWN WAY.
WHEN ARE YOU LEAVING?
ABOUT TWO WEEKS.
THEN WE BETTER MAKE THE MOST
OF THE TIME WE GOT LEFT.
WHY, LANE CRAWFORD.
WE HAVEN'T SEEN YOU IN AN AGE!
'EVENING.
YOU ARE JUST IN
TIME FOR SUPPER.
THANK YOU,
MA'AM.
COME ON IN.
LOTTIE, THAT DINNER
WAS CAPITAL. JUST CAPITAL.
THANK YOU, LANE.
YOU BETTER SET A LITTLE FARTHER
FROM THE TROUGH.
YOU'RE STARTING
TO LOOK LIKE GROVER CLEVELAND.
YOU GO TO HELL, SIR.
EXCUSE MY LANGUAGE.
NOT TO WORRY.
WHY DON'T YOU MEN
GO OUT ON THE PORCH
AND I'LL BRING THE
DRINKS AFTER I FINISH
CLEARING THE TABLE.
THANK YOU AGAIN,
MY DARLING.
CERTAINLY.
I GUESS I HURT
HIM, DIDN'T I?
HE THINKS THE
WORLD OF YOU.
REAL NICE PLACE
YOU GOT HERE, NOBLE.
TOO BAD TOM'S NOT GONNA
BE HERE TO HELP YOU RUN IT.
GOT HIS OWN LIFE
TO LIVE, I GUESS.
BUT IT STILL SEEMS
KIND OF A WASTE.
DID YOU EVER HEAR OF A MAN
NAMED JOHN STILWELL?
CALLS HIMSELF RED JACK.
HIM AND THREE OF HIS BUDDIES
BUSTED OUT OF YUMA PRISON.
THEY'VE ALREADY
KILLED FIVE PEOPLE.
OWING TO THE FACT THAT
THEY'RE FEDERAL FUGITIVES,
I GOT TO GO GET THEM.
WHY YOU TELLING ME THIS?
NEED A TRACKER.
PAYS $100 IN FOUND.
SORRY, I'M RETIRED.
I SAID NO TO GENERAL CROOK.
THEY'LL RUN GERONIMO
DOWN THIS TIME.
I DON'T WANT TO SEE IT.
I'M GONNA HAVE TO SAY NO TO YOU.
GOT THIS PAIN IN MY SIDE.
HURTS LIKE A SON OF A BITCH
MOST OF THE TIME.
YOU REMEMBER.
I GOT IT AT MERENZE.
THAT BOHUNK
WOULD HAVE TOOK
YOUR HEAD OFF IF IT
HADN'T OF BEEN FOR ME.
GODDAMN YOU.
CURSE ME ALL YOU WANT TO.
I CURSE MYSELF FOR
HAVING TO BRING IT UP.
BUT THE PLAIN FACT
OF THE MATTER IS
I'M GETTING OLD.
I NEED YA.
WHEN ARE YOU LEAVING?
SOONER THE BETTER.
WHO'S THERE?
JUST ME.
THEY TEACH YOU EAVESDROPPING
IN LAW SCHOOL?
AMONG OTHER THINGS.
I'M COMING WITH YOU.
AFTER THOSE MEN.
I'M COMING WITH YOU.
NO, YOU'RE NOT.
YES, I AM.
I'VE MADE UP MY MIND.
I APPRECIATE THE OFFER,
BUT THIS IS SOMETHING
YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT.
I NEVER HAD
THE CHANCE.
IT'S NOT THE
TIME TO LEARN.
WE DON'T RIDE UP AND SERVE
A WARRANT ON THEIR FRONT PORCH.
I KNOW THAT.
I CAN HOLD MY OWN.
CAN YOU?
YOU HAVEN'T GOT ANY IDEA.
THIS IS TRACKING A MAN DOWN
LIKE AN ANIMAL AND KILLING HIM.
WE MIGHT COULD
USE A LITTLE HELP.
SOMEBODY TO MAKE COFFEE.
BRING ALONG THE PACKHORSE.
THIS IS NOT LAW SCHOOL.
YOU'D BE DOING THE DIRTY WORK.
TAKING ORDERS.
IF YOU MESS UP, I'LL COME
DOWN ON YOU HARD.
I'LL GET MY
THINGS TOGETHER.
IT'S A SIDE OF ME
I HOPED HE'D NEVER SEE.
JOHNNY.
MARSHAL.
NOBLE AND TOM ADAMS.
SHERIFF MURDOCK.
WORD IS OUT YOU'S
RIDING. MAKE 'EM STAND
STRAIGHT IT WILL.
SHOW IT TO 'EM.
YES, SIR.
"DANITE."
THAT RINGS A BELL.
MOUNTAIN MEADOWS
MASSACRE.
DANITES WERE
A BAND OF MORMONS.
GUNMEN. CALL THEMSELVES
AVENGING ANGELS.
IN '47, A WAGON TRAIN WAS
PASSING THROUGH CEDAR CITY.
DANITES KILLED EVERYBODY
EXCEPT THE INFANTS.
WORD HAS IT THAT THE
GOOD MORMONS IN THAT AREA
TOOK IN THE ORPHANS AND
RAISED THEM AS THEIR OWN.
WAS STILWELL ONE OF THEM?
COULD'VE BEEN.
I RECKON THEY'RE HEADED
FOR UTAH. THEY FIGURE
THEY'D BE SAFE THERE.
WHERE DO WE START?
I NEED TO STOP
FOR WATER.
THERE. TRUSCOTT'S WELL.
RAISE YOUR RIGHT HAND.
DO YOU SWEAR TO UPHOLD THE
LAWS AND THE CONSTITUTION
OF THE U.S.A
AND THE TERRITORY OF ARIZONA
AND TO PROTECT OUR CITIZENS,
EVEN AT THE COST OF YOUR LIFE?
I DO.
I'M HUNGRY. I WONDER WHAT TIME
THE SLOP HOUSES OPEN UP.
IT'LL BE A WHILE. IT'S SUNDAY.
PEOPLE GO TO CHURCH FIRST.
BROTHER JOHN.
WHO ARE YOU?
NOT TALKING TO YOU, SCUM.
I'M ADDRESSING
BROTHER JOHN STILWELL.
ARE YOU A SAINT, FRIEND?
YES, I AM.
AND YOU ARE A LOATHSOME,
CRAWLING THING.
OLD BASTARD.
HOW DO YOU KNOW ME?
I WAS IN THE WESTERN UNION
OFFICE LAST NIGHT
WHEN YOUR DESCRIPTION
CAME OVER THE WIRE.
SAID YOU WERE A SAINT,
SO I STAYED UP
ALL NIGHT TO WARN YOU.
FIGURED IT WAS MY DUTY
TO THE CHURCH.
WARN ME ABOUT WHAT?
THE GENTILES.
THEY'RE COMING TO GET YOU.
AND I CAN'T SAY
AS HOW I BLAME 'EM MUCH.
THAT'S BEEN TRIED BEFORE.
NOT LIKE THIS TIME, DANITE.
THEY'VE SENT THEIR AVENGER,
NOBLE ADAMS.
ADAMS, COMING HERE?
BROUGHT YOU UP SHORT,
DIDN'T IT, FILTH?
EVEN THE APACHE
WERE SCARED OF ADAMS.
NOBLE ADAMS HIMSELF.
BE HERE NOON TOMORROW.
THANK YOU, BROTHER.
DON'T THANK ME, FRIEND.
I HOPE HE GETS YOU.
STILL AND ALL,
A SAINT'S A SAINT.
MAY GOD HELP ME.
THEY SURE STICK TOGETHER,
DON'T THEY?
NOBLE ADAMS
COMING AFTER ME.
COMING AFTER US.
WE BETTER GET TO COVER.
WHAT ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT?
HE'S JUST ANOTHER STINKING
BULL, AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED.
EVEN SO, MAYBE WE BETTER CALL IT
A DAY AND HEAD ON UP TO UTAH?
NOT JUST YET.
WHY NOT?
WE'VE GOT TO LEAVE
SOMETHING BEHIND
FOR MR. NOBLE ADAMS TO FIND.
INEZ, HAVE YOU SEEN MY COAT?
I PRESSED IT FOR
YOU, MR. BOLTON.
GOOD.
NOW, WHERE'S MY HAT?
HEY, MARY!
YOUR SISTER SURE DOES
LOOK NICE TODAY, DOESN'T SHE?
SHE SHOULD!
SHE'S BEEN UP SINCE 7:00
GETTING HERSELF
ALL GUSSIED UP FOR YOU.
I WAS NOT.
YOU WERE TOO.
SEE YOU THERE.
I KNOW SOMETHING YOU DON'T!
WHO ARE YOU FELLAS?
'MORNING.
WE WAS WONDERING MIGHT
YOU COULD SPARE SOME
WATER FOR OUR HORSES.
WHY DIDN'T YOU
COME AROUND THE FRONT?
WHERE YOU FELLAS FROM?
HEELER COUNTY.
WE'RE DROVERS.
HEELER COUNTY?
MARY.
MAKES ME SICK THE WAY SARAH
MAKES SUCH COW EYES AT LON.
SHE LIKES HIM.
HE MAKES ME TIRED.
HE THINKS HE'S SO BIG.
WHAT A SAP.
YOU GO GET READY
FOR CHURCH NOW.
I DON'T WANT TO GO TO
CHURCH. I HATE CHURCH.
COME ON!
OH, WELL.
NO!
BETTER NOT DROP THAT.
YOU'LL CATCH HELL FROM MY DAD.
LOOK AT THAT.
A LITTLE PRINCESS.
JUST A LITTLE GIRL, JACK.
NOW
THAT'S MORE LIKE IT.
WHAT HAVE WE GOT HERE?
TAKE THE KID OUTSIDE.
THE NAVAJO GIRL'S NAME IS INEZ.
SHE'S A HOUSEKEEPER.
SHE AND THE YOUNG GIRL, MARY,
BEEN MISSING SINCE YESTERDAY.
I CAN'T TELL YOU
HOW SORRY I AM.
YOUR FATHER AND
I SWAPPED HORSES,
AND RAN CATTLE TOGETHER.
HE WAS A GOOD MAN.
YOU'LL NEED SOMEPLACE
FOR YOUR SPARE HORSES.
HERE, I'LL SHOW YOU.
NOBLE.
TRAIL'S POINTED DUE NORTH.
LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE
HEADED FOR UTAH.
WE BETTER CATCH 'EM
BEFORE THEY GET THERE
OR WE'LL NEVER GET
THOSE GIRLS BACK.
THOSE THREE ARE
THE NAVAJO GIRL'S BROTHERS.
THE ONE ON THE RIGHT,
NAMED TONIO.
THEY WANT TO COME WITH US.
NO. I BETTER
TALK TO THEM.
YOU REMEMBER THAT TIME
WHEN YOU NEARLY FILLED
ME FULL OF BUCKSHOT?
YOU WERE RIDING HOME
IN A WAGON FULL OF TURNIPS
AND I HELD YOU UP FOR
THE WELLS FARGO PAYMENT.
YOU WERE ALWAYS MAD
WHEN I GOT THE DROP ON YOU.
I SAW YOU HALF
A MILE BACK THAT DAY.
YOU BEEN SAYING THAT
SINCE YOU WERE 8 YEARS OLD
BUT I CAUGHT YOU EVERY TIME.
YOUR FATHER LOVED YOU
VERY MUCH. YOU SHOULD
NEVER FORGET THAT.
I REMEMBER THE SUMMER
WHEN MY FATHER WAS
SCOUTING AGAINST THE NAVAJOS
AND YOU ALL PUT ME UP?
YOUR FATHER WOULD
KISS YOU EVERY NIGHT.
I REMEMBER IT WHEN HE TRIED
TO KISS YOU GOODNIGHT.
YOU WERE WHAT?
MAYBE 9, 10?
YOU WENT CRAZY.
I GUESS YOU'LL BE
MOVING ON NOW.
I'M NOT LEAVING.
I THOUGHT IT
MIGHT BE USEFUL--
NO ONE'S MAKING ME MOVE.
MY FATHER
BUILT THIS PLACE.
I'LL HIRE SOMEONE
TO WORK IT IF I HAVE TO,
BUT I'M NOT LEAVING.
MARY AND INEZ ARE
DEAD, AREN'T THEY?
NO, I THINK THEY'RE
ALL RIGHT.
WE'LL GET 'EM BACK.
DO YOU KNOW THE TEHATCHI BREAK
ON THE LITTLE COLORADO?
SURE DO.
TELL THE NAVAJOS
TO MEET US THERE
WITH THE SUPPLIES.
I WANT YOU TO GO WITH 'EM.
BRING A SPARE MOUNT.
YES, SIR. YOU CAN
COUNT ON IT.
THERE IT IS.
GOD.
YOU PATROLLED ALL THIS
WITH CAUTION IN '64?
NAVAJO CAMPAIGN.
FROM HERE, EAST TO NEW MEXICO
AND NORTH TO UTAH.
FIFTEEN THOUSAND SQUARE MILES.
HARD COUNTRY. BAD MEMORIES.
IF WE HEAD DUE EAST,
WE HAVE TO CUT THEIR TRAIL
SOONER OR LATER.
LIKE TRYING TO FIND
A WAVE IN THE OCEAN.
I'LL KNOW IT WHEN I SEE IT.
THERE'S TRACKS
ALL THROUGH HERE.
MUSTANGS. INDIAN PONIES.
NOT OUR PEOPLE.
INEZ.
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
THEY'LL SEND SOMEBODY
TO FIND US, YOU'LL SEE.
HERE'S WHERE
THEY MOUNTED THIS MORNING.
THESE TWO ARE THE GIRLS.
SEE THE SMALL PRINTS?
HERE'S THE HORSE
THAT WAS LEADING THEM.
SEE WHERE THE RIDER MOUNTED?
MEDIUM STRIDE, HIGH HEELED,
THAT'D BE THE HORSE THIEF.
MILLER.
THERE'S TWO MORE.
LONG STRIDE'S.
PROBABLY THE CAVALRYMAN.
THAT LEAVES STILWELL.
WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT THAT?
SEE THE WAY HIS HORSE VEERS
TO THE RIGHT EVERY FOURTH STEP?
MEANS HE'S HOLDING THE REIGNS
IN HIS RIGHT HAND.
SON OF A BITCH IS LEFT-HANDED.
BETTER THAN SIX HOURS
AHEAD OF US. WE GOT SOME
HARD RIDING TO DO.
GODDAMN IT!
WHY DON'T WE TAKE
THE LEE'S FERRY
INSTEAD OF CHASING
ALL OVER THE PLACE?
LOTS OF SUN, ISN'T THERE?
YOU COULD GO FASTER
IF YOU LET US GO.
WHO SAID YOU COULD TALK?
YOU AIN'T GOT NO RIGHT TO TALK.
WHAT'S THE MATTER,
LITTLE LADY?
YOU AIN'T TIRED
OF OUR COMPANY, ARE YOU?
PICKED UP A COUPLE
OF HOURS ON 'EM.
WE'LL CAMP HERE
AND REST THE HORSES.
MIGHT TAKE A BATH, TOO,
AS LONG AS WE'RE HERE.
BATH SOUNDS GREAT.
I DIDN'T SAY YOU.
FIRST ME AND LANE,
THEN THE HORSES, THEN YOU
IF THERE'S LIGHT LEFT.
THIS IS GREAT!
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
LEAVE ME HERE
AND I'LL CATCH UP
WITH YOU LATER?
I SAID, "WHY DON'T YOU
JUST LEAVE ME HERE
"AND I'LL CATCH UP WITH"
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.
I WANT MY CLOTHES!
YES, THIS IS WHAT PASSES
FOR YOUR FRONTIER HUMOR?
YOU LOOK FOR THESE?
I FOUND SOMEBODY!
'EVENING.
IS THAT HIM?
I DON'T KNOW. COULD BE.
WHAT THE HELL YOU DOING
RUNNING AROUND NAKED FOR?
I WAS TAKING A BATH.
LOOKS LIKE
A LITTLE BLUE ACORN.
CAN I HAVE MY CLOTHES?
I DOUBT IT.
DO AS HE SAYS.
NOW.
WHO ARE YOU?
WE'RE UNITED
STATES MARSHALS.
WHO MIGHT YOU BE?
CHUB DUMONT.
THESE HERE IS MY PARTNERS.
ARMY HORSES?
YEAH.
BOUGHT 'EM AT A GOVERNMENT
AUCTION IN FORT STOCKTON.
FORT STOCKTON, TEXAS?
LITTLE FAR AFIELD, AIN'T YA?
MATTER OF FACT, WE ARE.
LIKE TO KEEP ON THE MOVE.
WE WAS IN WINSLOW
A COUPLE DAYS AGO
AND THIS HERE COME OUT.
BOUNTY HUNTERS.
PICKED UP YOUR TRAIL YESTERDAY.
THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE STILWELL.
GUESS WE WAS WRONG.
SO HAPPENS
WE'RE AFTER THE SAME PARTY.
THAT A FACT?
WE AIM TO GET THAT MONEY,
MISTER, ONE WAY OR THE OTHER.
WHY DON'T YOU STRING
ALONG WITH US?
BOUNTY'S NONE OF OUR CONCERN.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
THESE MEN LOOK HUNGRY,
WHY DON'T Y'ALL START DINNER?
COME DOWN THE RIVER WITH ME.
I'LL SHOW YOU THEIR TRAIL.
SCURVY LOOKING BUNCH.
I'VE SEEN WORSE.
WHAT ABOUT THOSE HORSES?
I NEVER KNEW THE ARMY
TO SELL 8-YEAR-OLD HORSES.
IT DOESN'T.
THEY'RE DESERTERS.
I'LL HAVE SOME MORE
OF THAT COFFEE, ACORN.
MY NAME'S TOM.
WELL, THANKS, ACORN.
REAL ELEVATED COMPANY
WE'RE TRAVELING IN.
JUST LEAVE IT ALONE.
GET THESE CLEANED UP.
CHUB
LOOKS LIKE OL' ACORN'S
THE NIGGER OF THAT OUTFIT.
I TOLD YOU ONCE,
MY NAME'S TOM. I'D APPRECIATE
IT IF YOU'D USE IT.
ARE YOU GONNA MAKE ME?
WHAT'D YOU HAVE IN MIND,
A SPELLING CONTEST?
LOOK AT HIM.
SCRUBBING OUT THEM DISHES
AND POURING COFFEE
JUST LIKE
A FINE LITTLE WIFE.
YOU WANNA BE A SQUAW,
BOY,
JUST COME OVER HERE
AND SIT ON BOB'S LAP.
I AIN'T HAD A WOMAN IN A MONTH.
I'LL MAKE YOU SQUAW!
ALL RIGHT. GET UP.
LORD, IF IT AIN'T
JOHN L. SULLIVAN HIS OWN SELF.
I GUESS I'M JUST GONNA
HAVE TO BEAT YOU LIKE A DOG.
SHIT, THAT'S RANK.
LOST YOUR SUPPER
AND A FIGHT ALL AT ONCE.
WANT SOME MORE?
THAT'LL DO.
YOU SHOWED HIM.
YOU STRAIGHTENED
THAT BOY OUT.
HE SURE DID!
GET AWAY FROM THAT.
I SAID, "GET AWAY
FROM THAT PISTOL."
GIVE ME A DRINK.
YOU HAD IT, BOY?
NEEDING A BIG 'UN?
WHERE'D YOU LEARN
TO FIGHT LIKE THAT, SON?
PHILADELPHIA.
PROFESSOR MIKE DONOVAN.
THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL.
THAT WAS ARTISTIC!
YOU BEAT
THE SHIT OUT OF HIM!
I GUESS I DID, DIDN'T I?
WHY DIDN'T YOU SHOOT HIM?
SIR?
HE WAS GONNA KILL YOU.
COME ON,
HE JUST GOT ANGRY.
HE WAS GONNA KILL YOU.
YOU ONLY PULL THAT WEAPON
FOR ONE REASON.
IF YOU'RE GONNA CARRY ONE,
YOU BETTER BE READY TO USE IT.
YOU'RE NOT.
SO LET'S HAVE IT.
SIDE ARMS, SIR.
WE'LL JUST KEEP THIS
ON THE PACKHORSE FROM NOW ON.
YOU JUST HAD TO
TAKE HIM DOWN A PEG,
DIDN'T YOU?
HE THINKS THIS
IS SOME KIND OF GAME.
GOOD MORNING.
'MORNING.
COFFEE'LL BE UP IN A MINUTE.
GOOD.
THE BOUNTY HUNTERS.
WHERE'D THEY GO?
'MORNING, TOM.
TOOK OFF A COUPLE HOURS AGO,
HEADED FOR BLACK FALLS.
SHOULDN'T WE GET AFTER 'EM?
STILWELL DIDN'T
HEAD FOR BLACK FALLS.
I SHOWED 'EM
THE WRONG TRAIL.
THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE
PUTTING ONE OVER ON US.
WHAT TRAIL
DID THEY FOLLOW?
REMEMBER THOSE
MUSTANG TRACKS?
THEY KEEP GOING
LIKE THEY'RE GOING,
THEY'LL END UP IN MEXICO.
I HATE THIS WIND!
THIS AIN'T NOTHING.
LOOK AT THAT!
I DON'T LIKE
THE LOOKS OF THAT!
WE GOTTA TAKE COVER.
WHERE?
I KNOW A PLACE.
FOSSIL HILL.
GODDAMN IT.
IT'S A NORTHER.
COME EARLY THIS YEAR.
HAVE TO WAIT IT OUT.
COME ON.
FEELS LIKE ANTS
ARE EATIN' ME.
WON'T BE A TRACK
LEFT OUT THERE.
THEY GOT TO
GET TO SHELTER, TOO.
THERE IS ONE PLACE THEY COULD
GO, BUT I DOUBT IF THEY
KNOW ABOUT IT.
NOT MANY WHITE MEN DO.
MAYBE....
WHAT?
NOTHING.
SPIT IT OUT.
I WAS JUST THINKING,
MAYBE THE NAVAJO GIRL
WOULD KNOW.
MIND IF WE HOLE UP HERE
UNTIL THE WIND BLOWS OVER?
COME ON!
GOT SOMETHING TO DRINK
OVER THERE, CHIEF?
I THINK IT'S PARTY TIME.
THAT SMELLS
LIKE HORSE PISS!
THAT'S TIZWAN.
THE OL' MAN MUST BE
PART APACHE.
YOU WANT SOME OF THIS BREW?
YOU KNOW WHAT THIS PLACE IS?
IT'S AN OLD-TIME
INDIAN CLIFF HOUSE.
NO,
IT'S TESTIMONY.
IT'S WHAT?
TESTIMONY TO
THE BOOK OF MORMON.
OH, BOY.
HERE WE GO.
THE BOOK
OF MORMON TEACHES
THAT WAY BACK IN BIBLE TIMES,
A LOST TRIBE OF ISRAEL
SETTLED HERE.
AFTER A WHILE,
THEY SPLIT INTO TWO BUNCHES.
THE NEPHITES,
WHO WERE BELOVED OF GOD
AND THE LAMANITES,
WHO WERE EVIL.
THEY HAD THIS WAR,
AND THE LAMANITES
KILLED OFF THE NEPHITES.
GOD WAS SO ANGRY
HE TURNED THEIR SKINS RED
AND MADE THEM DARK SAVAGES.
THAT'S WHY YOU'VE GOT
YOUR INDIANS TODAY!
HE IS A LAMANITE!
YOU SEE THIS? IT'S AN
OLD-TIME LAMANITE SKULL.
NAVAJO.
NO.
YOU ARE A LAMANITE.
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO STAY ONE.
YOU CAN BECOME WHITE
AND DELIGHTSOME AGAIN
IN HIS SIGHT.
THAT'S BULLSHIT
AND YOU KNOW IT.
NO, IT'S THE GOSPEL,
I'M TELLING YOU!
UP AROUND CEDAR CITY WE GOT UTES
JUST AS DARK AND UGLY AS HELL.
BUT WHEN WE BAPTIZE THEM
YOU CAN SEE 'EM BECOMING PALE
AND WHITE AND DELIGHTSOME AGAIN.
I'D SAY SHE LOOKS DELIGHTSOME
JUST THE WAY SHE IS.
HERE, HOLD THIS!
COME HERE, LITTLE LADY!
ARE YOU MAD AT ME?
DO YOU LIKE ME?
I GUESS SO.
YOU KNOW, IF I HAD A DAUGHTER,
I'D WANT HER TO BE
JUST LIKE YOU.
'CAUSE I THINK YOU'RE
A PRINCESS.
THANK YOU.
HOW OLD ARE YOU?
TWELVE AND A HALF.
CAN YOU REMEMBER THINGS
FROM WHEN YOU WERE REAL LITTLE?
DID YOU KNOW
I WAS AN ORPHAN?
A NICE MORMON FAMILY
TOOK ME IN TO RAISE.
JUST LIKE THEIR OWN,
OUTSIDE CEDAR CITY.
YOU EVER BEEN TO UTAH?
NO.
YOU'LL LIKE IT.
I GOT A HOUSE THERE
AND WE COULD FIX IT UP
AND LIVE IN IT.
NO!
AND AFTER A WHILE
SAY, ABOUT THREE YEARS....
I WANT TO GO HOME NOW!
PRINCESS.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO CRY,
EVER, PRINCESS.
I WON'T LET ANYTHING
HAPPEN TO YOU, EVER.
I PROMISE.
NOW, LOOK, I'M GONNA
DO SOMETHING NICE FOR YOU.
YOU'LL LIKE IT IN UTAH.
WE'LL HAVE LOTS OF FUN.
YOU'LL SEE.
HECK, WE GONNA GET THE CHIEF
TO COME AND BE OUR DADDY.
HOW 'BOUT THAT, CHIEF?
YOU WANNA BE OUR DAD?
NO.
WHY THE HELL NOT? YOU WANNA
STAY HERE AND DIE
ALL BY YOURSELF?
NOT AFRAID.
I DIE, I GO
BECOME LEGEND.
A LEGEND.
THEY WERE HERE ALL RIGHT.
OLD MAN SAID
THEY PULLED OUT YESTERDAY.
WHAT ABOUT THE GIRLS?
ARE THEY ALL RIGHT?
HE SAID THEY HAD THEIR WAY
WITH THE NAVAJO GIRL.
GODDAMN IT.
SOONER THEY HANG, THE BETTER.
COME ON,
WE'RE BURNING DAYLIGHT.
WHAT IS IT?
WHY WOULD THEY
LEAVE A TRAIL SO CLEAR?
SON OF A BITCH.
KNOW WHAT THAT IS?
LOOKS LIKE A HORSE APPLE.
DAY OLD. SEE WHAT
HE'S BEEN EATING?
THAT'S GRAMA.
THERE'S NO GRAMA AROUND HERE.
GROWS 10 MILES UP THE WASH.
THE FALSE TRAIL.
THEY'VE BACKTRACKED.
THEY'RE BEHIND US.
IN TWO DAYS,
THEY'LL BE AT LEE'S FERRY.
ONCE ACROSS THE RIVER,
THEY'RE THREE HOURS
FROM UTAH AND HOME FREE.
THEN, LETS GET AFTER 'EM.
NO, WAIT A MINUTE.
MAYBE WE CAN BEAT 'EM TO IT.
IF WE CUT ACROSS HERE, WE CAN BE
AT LEE'S FERRY AHEAD OF 'EM.
THERE'S A MOUNTAIN IN THE WAY!
RIGHT.
COME ON.
WE'LL HAVE
TO PULL IT TO THE TOP.
WATCH YOURSELF.
WATCH OUT.
NICE VIEW.
DON'T JUST STAND HERE
AND ADMIRE IT. LET'S GET GOIN'.
I'LL GET SOME MORE WOOD.
BOY'S ALL RIGHT.
GOT A LOT OF BARK ON HIM.
YOU SEE HOW HE GOT DOWN
UNDER THAT HORSE TODAY?
SCARED ME TO DEATH.
STILL CAN'T FIGURE WHY HE WANTS
TO LIVE IN PHILADELPHIA.
DO YOU EVER NOTICE THE WAY
HE LOOKS AT ME SOMETIMES?
HIS MOTHER USED TO LOOK AT ME
THAT WAY WHEN
WE LIVED BACK EAST.
SHE WASN'T ASHAMED OF ME, BUT
I DIDN'T HAVE THE EDUCATION
OF HER FRIENDS.
I THINK SOMETIMES SHE FELT
BAD FOR ME IN FRONT OF PEOPLE.
I THINK THAT'S WHY
SHE HAD ME BRING HER OUT HERE.
THAT'S WHY I SENT TOM
BACK EAST TO COLLEGE
SO NO ONE WOULD EVER
LOOK AT HIM THAT WAY.
THERE THEY ARE.
WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR?
THEY'D SEE US COMING.
WE'LL TAKE 'EM TOMORROW
AT LEE'S FERRY.
WISH WE HAD A FIRE.
NOT TONIGHT.
THEY'RE TOO CLOSE.
LOOK AT THAT SKY.
YOU CAN SEE EVERY STAR
GOD CREATED.
YOU CAN SEE A LOT OF 'EM.
KIND OF MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE
YOU BELONG TO SOMETHING BIGGER.
I GUESS IT DOES.
I GUESS THAT'S WHY
YOU STAY OUT HERE.
I GUESS THAT IS WHY.
GOODNIGHT, SIR.
GOODNIGHT, PARTNER.
GOOD ENOUGH. TOM AND I'LL CROSS
THE RIVER AND SET UP
ON THE BANK.
ALL RIGHT. I'LL BE ON
THIS SIDE IN THE TREES.
WHEN THEY'RE ALL IN THE RIVER,
I'LL HOLLER AT 'EM
TO SURRENDER.
IN THAT CURRENT,
WE'LL HAVE 'EM.
ALL RIGHT.
BUT IF ANYTHING GOES WRONG,
DON'T STOP TO ARGUE ABOUT IT.
SHOOT TO KILL.
I'VE BEEN MEANIN' TO ASK YOU
WHY YOU STILL USE
THAT SINGLE SHOT?
HITS HARDER.
WHAT IF YOU MISS?
I DON'T PLAN TO.
WHAT IS IT?
GODDAMN
BOUNTY HUNTERS!
GET OUT OF HERE!
STILWELL!
HOLD IT RIGHT THERE.
GODDAMN IT, WE LOST 'EM.
COME ON BACK.
LANE!
GET THE BANDAGES
OUT OF THE PACKHORSE. QUICK!
EASY, PARTNER.
LIE STILL.
STILWELL SHOT ME.
TOOK THE HORSE.
EASY.
WHAT'D HE SAY?
HE SAYS STILWELL SHOT HIM
AND TOOK HIS HORSE.
EASY!
HE TOOK
MY BADGE.
HOW'S YOUR MAN?
HE'S DEAD.
I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT.
OL' BOB SAID HE PICKED UP
YOUR TRAIL IN THE WOODS.
LOOKED LIKE THEY'S
HEADED SOUTH.
JUST TOUCH THOSE GUNS.
GET UP.
YOU MEN CAN RIDE OUT OF HERE
OR YOU CAN DIE.
THERE'S NO THIRD WAY.
LEAVE THAT TRASH
WHERE IT LAYS.
ONE MORE THING.
IF I EVER SEE
ANY OF YOU AGAIN
EXPECT NO QUARTER.
HE'S COMING.
WE ABOUT GAVE UP ON YOU.
WHERE'D YOU GET THE HORSE?
YOU'LL NEVER GUESS.
BOYS, I GOT ME NOBLE ADAMS.
HE JUST COME OUT OF NOWHERE.
BUT I WAS TOO QUICK FOR HIM.
I FILLED HIM SO FULL OF HOLES,
HE WOULDN'T FLOAT IN BRINE.
WOULDN'T FLOAT!
LOOK, THERE'S HIS BADGE.
BUT LOOK AT THIS.
WHAT IS IT?
WHAT DOES IT SAY?
SAYS THERE'S
A $500 REWARD FOR US.
THAT'S YOUR NAME RIGHT THERE.
$500?
LOOK AT THAT,
THAT'S $125 APIECE.
THAT'S A
PRETTY PIECE OF MONEY!
DEAD OR ALIVE.
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN.
BOUNTY HUNTERS.
THEY'LL CAMP IN THOSE TREES.
PROBABLY PAY US
A VISIT BEFORE MORNIN'.
I CAN'T ALLOW THAT.
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?
WE'RE GONNA KILL 'EM.
JUST LIKE THAT?
THEY HAD THEIR CHANCE.
AIN'T NO NEED
TO BOTHER WITH THAT.
WE AIN'T
GONNA BE HERE THAT LONG.
I'LL CROSS HERE. YOU GO
UPSTREAM,
AND GET THE OTHER SIDE OF 'EM.
WE'LL GET 'EM IN A CROSSFIRE.
ALL RIGHT?
YEAH.
WAIT FOR MY FIRST SHOT.
AIM LOW,
DON'T SHOOT TOO FAST.
HAMMER DOWN
ON AN EMPTY CHAMBER?
YEAH.
LOAD IT.
YOU'RE GONNA NEED ALL SIX.
HOW'S THAT FACE, CHUB?
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.
I'M GONNA SNATCH THAT BASTARD'S
PRIVATES OUT, YOU CAN BET ON IT.
FILL UP THEM CANTEENS
BEFORE WE MOVE OUT.
SNATCH OUT HIS PRIVATES!
OVER HERE.
COME ON, ACORN!
COME ON, ACORN!
KILL ME!
PUT ANOTHER ONE IN HIM.
KILL HIM!
I DON'T FEEL SO GOOD.
WHY DON'T YOU SIT THERE?
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
IT HAPPENS TO EVERYBODY.
I LOST MY NERVE.
NO, YOU DIDN'T.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
I JUST COULDN'T KILL HIM.
IF YOU HAD KILLED HIM
YOU'D FEEL
A HELL OF A LOT WORSE,
BELIEVE ME.
YOU JUST REST THERE.
I'M GONNA CUT LOOSE THE HORSES.
WHAT ABOUT THE BODIES?
TO HELL WITH THEM.
WE'VE WASTED ENOUGH TIME
AS IT IS.
WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE GO NORTHEAST THIS TIME
THROUGH MARSH PASS?
I SAID, WHAT ABOUT GOING
THROUGH MARSH PASS?
I HATE THIS WIND.
WE SHOULD CATCH UP
WITH 'EM BY MORNIN'.
I HOPE THOSE INDIANS
MAKE LITTLE COLORADO.
WE ONLY GOT
ONE DAY'S SUPPLY LEFT.
PLACE LOOKS KIND OF FAMILIAR.
FORT CAMMY'S 120 MILES THAT WAY.
YOU WERE BORN THERE.
WHEN YOU WERE 2 YEARS OLD,
I DECIDED TO LEAVE THE ARMY.
LOADED YOU AND YOUR MOTHER
IN A WAGON,
WE SET OUT FOR FLAGSTAFF.
WE'D STOP FOR THE NIGHT
RIGHT DOWN IN THAT BASIN.
YOUR MOTHER HAD JUST HANDED
YOU DOWN TO ME.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
MADE THE HORSES JUMP.
THE WAGON ROLLED,
AND SHE FELL UNDER THE WHEEL.
HER RIBS WERE ALL STOVED IN.
WE WERE MILES AWAY
FROM ANY HELP.
I TRIED TO MOVE HER,
BUT EVERY TIME SHE'D SCREAM.
SHE STARTED SPITTING BLOOD.
THE HURT COME IN WAVES
AND YOU'D START CRYING.
SHE'D SWALLOW THE PAIN
AND HOLD YOU IN HER ARMS
TILL YOU QUIETED DOWN.
MUST HAVE BEEN ALMOST MORNING
AND SHE STARTED TO GO.
I TOLD HER,
"YOU'RE GONNA MAKE IT.
"YOUR SON LOVES YOU TOO MUCH
TO LET YOU DIE."
SHE SMILED AT THAT.
THEN, SHE WAS GONE.
SHE'S BURIED RIGHT OUT THERE
SOMEWHERE.
WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'?
WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'?
MARY, GO!
WHAT HAPPENED, JACK?
TAKE THE PRINCESS AWAY.
SURE, JACK.
SHE CUT ME.
UNLOAD THE PACKHORSE.
BRING ME A BLANKET.
THE REST OF THEM ARE
AT THE LITTLE COLORADO
WITH OUR SUPPLIES.
HE'S GONNA BE BACK IN A
COUPLE OF HOURS
WITH HIS BROTHERS.
I'VE GOTTA TAKE
A LONG CHANCE.
I GOTTA KNOW IF I
CAN COUNT ON YOU.
IF I CAN'T, SAY SO,
BUT I GOTTA KNOW.
YOU CAN.
INEZ. I WANT TO KNOW
WHERE SHE IS.
I TOLD YOU, PRINCESS,
I LET HER GO.
CAN'T YOU LET ME GO?
SOMEBODY'S COMING.
ONE RIDER. HE'S GOT A RIFLE.
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.
WAIT A MINUTE.
THAT'S JUST ONE MAN.
I AIN'T RUNNING FROM ONE MAN.
GOES AGAINST THE GRAIN.
ME NEITHER.
I'M SICK OF RUNNING.
YOU BOYS DO
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO.
WHAT ABOUT YOU, KID?
YOU GONNA BE A RABBIT
ALL YOUR LIFE?
I AIN'T A RABBIT.
THEN LET'S GET HIM.
HALT!
UNITED STATES MARSHAL!
GET AWAY FROM HIM, MARY.
I CAN'T!
STOP.
I'LL SHOOT!
I'M JUST TURNING HER LOOSE.
NO!
DAMN.
CINCH THAT UP.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOUR LEG?
I THINK IT'S BROKE.
SURE IS.
TWO PLACES.
WHAT HAPPENED?
I DON'T KNOW.
I HAD HIM, BUT HE GOT AWAY.
I CAN SEE THAT.
WHAT HAPPENED?
I HAD HIM IN SIGHT
BUT I COULDN'T SHOOT HIM.
YOU HAD HIM IN YOUR SIGHTS?
HE HAD THE GIRL
IN FRONT OF HIM.
I DIDN'T WANNA HIT HER.
GET OVER THERE.
GET UP, BOY.
I CAN'T.
STAND UP!
EITHER OF YOU KNOW
WHICH WAY THEY'RE HEADED?
SEARCH ME.
I MEAN TO HAVE THAT GIRL SAFE.
I'LL ASK YOU AGAIN.
WHERE'S STILWELL HEADED?
GUESS.
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?
ALL RIGHT,
SAME QUESTION.
HE SAID HE WAS GONNA
TAKE THE GIRL HOME.
WHICH WAY?
MARSH PASS, I THINK.
THAT'S 80 MILES.
WHERE'S HE GONNA GET WATER?
I DON'T KNOW. THAT'S
ALL HE SAID, I SWEAR.
SORRY, SON,
BUT WE DON'T HAVE
A HORSE FOR YOU.
PLEASE, YOU CAN'T
LEAVE ME OUT HERE.
THERE'S PEOPLE
IN LITTLE COLORADO,
I CAN'T WALK ON THIS LEG.
GUESS YOU'RE OUT
OF LUCK, THEN.
HERE, TAKE THIS.
WE'LL BE NEEDING THAT.
GET ON THAT HORSE,
DAMN YOU.
PLEASE, MISTER!
I'LL DIE OUT HERE.
HELLO. I HAVE SOME
BAD NEWS FOR YOU.
I KNOW. TONIO BROUGHT
HER BACK THIS MORNING.
WHAT ABOUT MY SISTER?
I'LL DO EVERYTHING IN MY
POWER TO GET HER BACK.
I RODE OUT WITH LON AND HIS
FATHER. THEY'RE UPSTREAM
CATCHING SUPPER.
I HOPE YOU CAN STAY.
I CAME FOR A FRESH HORSE.
CAN I FILL THIS FOR YOU?
IF YOU WOULD.
I WOULDN'T BOTHER WITH THAT.
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE THE REST
OF THE HORSES TO THE RAILHEAD.
I'LL MEET YOU THERE
WHEN I'M DONE.
I'M COMING WITH YOU.
I THINK IT'D BE BETTER
IF YOU DIDN'T.
WHY?
WHY IN THE HELL NOT?
IS IT EASIER TO KILL 'EM
IF I'M NOT WATCHING YOU?
THANK YOU.
I KNOW WHERE HE IS.
HOME SWEET HOME.
AN INDIAN CLIFF DWELLING.
WE WERE THERE.
BE CAREFUL.
I WILL.
I'LL BRING HER BACK.
HELLO, THE HOUSE!
HI, CHIEF. WE'RE HOME.
I SAID, "WE'RE HOME."
LET'S GO, PRINCESS.
YOU SICK YOUR DOG ON ME?
LEAVE HIM ALONE!
YOU LIKE THAT INDIAN
BETTER THAN YOU LIKE ME?
ANSWER ME,
YOU DIRTY LITTLE WHORE!
GOODBYE, TRASH.
DON'T I GET A TRIAL?
YOUR HANDS ON A CHILD,
ALL YOU GET IS DEAD.
NO!
PLEASE, MISTER.
DROP IT.
GET UP.
PUT YOUR HANDS UP.
NOBLE ADAMS.
RIGHT.
MISTER,
TAKE ME HOME NOW, PLEASE.
I WANT TO SEE MY DADDY.
PLEASE GET UP, MISTER!
RUN!
YOU COME BACK OVER HERE
AND STAY HERE!
GOTCHA GOOD, DIDN'T I?
NOW, YOU DON'T MIND
IF I TAKE THE PRINCESS
FOR A RIDE, DO YOU?
I SAID
YOU DON'T MIND IF ME AND THE
PRINCESS GO FOR A RIDE, DO YOU?
GO TO HELL.
NOT ME, MR. NOBLE.
NOT ME.
BACK SHOT ME.
MY GOD.
BLOOD'S DARK.
THE BULLET'S IN MY LIVER.
I'LL BE DEAD IN AN HOUR.
YOU'RE GONNA MAKE IT, SIR.
GET HIM.
I'LL BE BACK.
STAY THERE
TILL I COME FOR YOU.
GO ON.
I KNOW WHEN I'M LICKED.
YOU GONNA HANG ME?
NO.
THEN THEY'LL SEND ME
BACK TO YUMA.
NO, THEY WON'T.
THEY WON'T?
'CAUSE I'M SENDING
YOU TO HELL.
AND LET'S JUST SEE WHAT'S
IN THAT LEFT HAND OF YOURS.
HE GOT HIM.
HE DIE.
HE GO
BECOME LEGEND.
WAIT A MINUTE. HOLD ON.
PUT HIM SOMEWHERE ELSE.
IT'S GONNA COST YOU.
I DON'T CARE.
I WON'T HAVE HIM IN THERE
WITH MY FATHER.
HAVE YOU THOUGHT
ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO?
FIRST THING IS
TO GET HIM BACK HOME.
TRY TO EXPLAIN TO MY STEPMOTHER
HOW I GOT HER MAN KILLED.
IT WASN'T YOUR FAULT.
WASN'T IT?
TOM!
I GOT YOU A NEWSPAPER.
THE  DENVER TIMES .
ONLY A WEEK OLD.
THANK YOU.
GOODBYE.
THANK YOU, TOM.
WHEN I GET THINGS
STRAIGHTENED OUT,
IF IT'S ALL RIGHT WITH YOU,
I'LL PAY YOU A CALL.
WE'D LIKE THAT.
I'LL SEE YOU THEN,
IN THE SPRING.
