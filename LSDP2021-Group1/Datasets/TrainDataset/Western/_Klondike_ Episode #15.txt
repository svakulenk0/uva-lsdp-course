then someone came and decided
they'd take it from you?
Man: I got a feeling this little
bag here more than suffice.
that is the earth into
things that cannot last?
This here champagne's
all the way from France!
Oh, hell.
Again?
Insides is in rebellion.
You didn't eat nothing.
The story I heard, a hungry
man craps out his heart.
- Hey, Bill?
- Yeah?
What you gonna do with all
your riches you get out of here?
Buy a 100 acres of prime,
arable farmland in Vermont.
You ought to come give it a visit.
Ugh. You concentrating in there?
I'm gonna by me an orange.
An orange?
Work camp in Dakota. A fella give me one.
It was like eating a color in juice form.
A fruit right out of Eden itself.
Inside, it's already sectioned up.
A fruit divided into bites for you...
it's like it grew for man to eat it.
Almost makes you think of the creator.
Feeling better?
- Not really.
-
I'm just hungry, is all.
Not a speck of food in all of Dawson...
that's edible, anyway.
The meat in town will kill you.
All this goddamn gold and
we can't get a good meal.
You watch over claim 152.
I'll lessen the world of an elk.
Claim 152 shall be watched over.
You're gonna need some help
bringing back the carcass.
I know a spot where the elk
drink not 10 miles from here.
We're burning daylight. Let's get to it.
The elk... they break up
the ice with their hooves,
look around for wolves,
but they don't expect a bullet from afar.
Oh, we know it's coming our whole lives
but it's always a surprise.
Bullet from afar.
You seen a lot of death, huh?
That's what soldiering will do for you.
Amazes me you can still
shoot without a thumb.
You just learn anew, is all.
Where were you when it happened?
Oh, a skirmish in Buenos Aires.
Me being a man and the
enemy being men, too,
in the midst of battle,
it's kind of like telling
one elk from another.
Army calls men in my situation
an accidental hostile.
- Shot by your own, huh?
-
Yeah.
Well, I was trained as a sharpshooter.
I was stationed on a hill about
a 100 yards from the battle.
I got hit in the back, shoulder.
Lost way more blood on those
two, but the damn thumb...
You know, the prehensile thumb
is what allowed early men to use tools.
It's what distinguishes man from ape.
Army turned me into an ape.
Would you mind cocking this for me?
I can load and shoot, but...
I have
difficulty with the barrel.
Your speciality, isn't it?
Taking down a target from afar.
Kind of like how your friend went down,
is what you're saying.
You know, the one that
took down your friend...
it would have had a louder report.
It meant it came from a bigger-bore
gun than this peashooter.
And you know that how?
It was in the mine next
to yours, don't forget.
I may not be worth much,
but I do know rifles, friend.
How loud it was, must
have a .45, .50 caliber.
You do know rifles.
It was a .45.
Not a .30 caliber like this one.
See them peaks there?
Well, that valley between there
is protected from the wind.
There's a shelter there.
It's made of logs and bark.
Abandoned by the tlingit.
Place like that, a man
could survive for years.
Just living and hunting.
No need for gold. Just the essentials.
For your hands are defiled in blood,
your fingers with iniquity.
Your lips have spoken lies.
Your tongue hath muttered perverseness.
- No defiler has eternal life.
- Sabine: Father.
I'm thinking prayer is not
gonna help much right now.
Not like a good nap will.
I think you'd better come back later, Bill.
He's not well.
Sabine, uh... maybe a bit of whiskey
hasten that nap you were talking about.
Think I might need some myself.
Pretty sure I know who killed my friend.
It was Goodman.
Wasn't it?
A murderer walks amongst us.
That's not God's plan.
What makes
you think he's got a plan?
Hmm?
You don't have to say it.
You don't have to break the bond.
Just nod.
God ain't watching you.
I promise he's not.
We're all one thing, you know.
You kill another, you kill yourself...
become a ghost.
No small talk?
I'd rather just carry your
bag to wherever it needs to go.
I liked it better when you used to smile.
The air smells nice.
Beautiful.
I heard you visited me while I was sick.
I have a memory of our... hands touching.
Did I do the touching or did you?
Me?
I just can't help but
play my cards around you,
for some reason.
Listen...
There's some things I got to do.
Don't you give me the "soldier
going off to war" speech.
I seen that look as
soon as you walked in...
the killer look.
The Yukon got you.
Didn't it, Haskell?
Ah, God damn it.
God damn it.
There ain't nothing noble in a fight.
Only in survival.
You go.
You get out while you can.
I don't want to see you again, Bill.
Not with that look on your face.
Count: No need.
I just came to pay my respects.
You're dying, right?
I fail to see what that
has to do with anything.
Oh.
Typhus is a bitch, isn't it?
You know, this is just a wooden box.
You shouldn't have let me kill you over it.
You are genuinely insane, aren't you?
Probably.
You remember over by the cemetery,
and you told me that I was a
dead man and not just in this life?
And that you, you said... you were saved?
You know, you genuinely believed
that your God was gonna
protect you from the typhus.
So I figured I was gonna win both ways.
Either you would somehow impossibly survive
and then I'd have proof
that your God exists or...
You'd end up just as you are now.
I killed you.
I didn't even have to fire a shot.
So you're convinced that
you've brought this down on me.
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
So, your God should just
strike me down right here.
Right?
A bolt of lightning from the heavens.
No?
Nothing.
This is all there is, Father.
There's only this life.
Soapy:  Your
hands are shaking, dentist.
Is it fear or distaste?
Might I ask where you practiced?
I don't practice. I just do.
My Father was a practitioner.
I learned from watching him.
I hope you took notes.
I'm an important man, you know.
I own 12 mines, all being
worked by their former owners.
You've had good fortune.
Fortune's got nothing to do with it.
Fortune's a bitch.
Trick is to look for present-day 'tunities
and grab those 'tunities when they come.
And I just grabbed one.
We're cleaning up Dawson, Soapy.
That means we're cleaning you up.
How's that, now?
I'm just a law-abiding citizen,
a businessman just looking for 'tunities.
'Tunities like buying up real claims
and selling non-existent claims.
"Lawson City."
Could kill that printer.
I'm trying to find out
where those claims are going.
The good news is, you're
gonna tell me. Get up.
Add armed resistance to the list.
I'm a bigger man than you, Superintendent.
You're gonna see that.
The world works in mysterious ways.
I am a bigger man than you.
- Howdy.
- Man: New blankets?
Too much smoke!
Belinda: Why haven't the men been working?
We've got money to pay them.
It's not about the money.
It's about fear.
Laborers can't work on the hotel
because the Count's
men are leaning on them.
God damn it.
It's bad enough for a
woman to be alone at night.
Even worse if she's carrying money.
You could kill me right now.
But the way I look at it,
you don't need a one-off,
living hand-to-mouth,
shivering in the night
for another man's agenda.
Which is exactly what
you're doing for the Count.
I can offer you a steady cash flow.
Regular employment.
That right there will
cover you for three weeks,
which is about three weeks
more than the Count's offering.
There will be more to come.
You don't just switch jobs
with a man like the Count.
You're the one with the gun.
You can do whatever you want.
With him, he'll just get more men.
I get the feeling
there's an idea percolating
somewhere in there.
We terminate the man...
terminate the relationship.
I want you to work for me.
I do not want you to kill him.
Well...
that's what it's gonna take.
I won't pay for murder.
I won't do that.
Yukon gets to all of us
sooner or later, lady.
What do you say?
Your prisoners have been
sitting in their cells,
leading the life of Riley,
eating, drinking at our expense.
Why haven't they been hanged?
We're waiting on the weather.
The cold snap such as this,
the ropes have been known to burst.
You have two days to hang
them, cold snap or no.
Oh, and incidentally, you're
to release Soapy Smith, as well.
Soapy Smith is a documented con man.
These mining camps you see around you?
They're just scraping at the gold.
In a few months, real
companies will be here
to mine the area hydraulically.
And that has what to do with Mr. Smith?
Nothing.
It has to do with you,
Your role here.
You and Mr. Smith are both gnats.
But necessary gnats.
In some ways, Mr. Smith
is more necessary than you.
He's the middle man, isn't he?
Gathering up claims on the cheap
before the big companies come.
You've done your Bible
studies, haven't you?
The good book has a great word
that perfectly describes your position.
"Abide."
Superintendent?
Abide.
Mm.
I brought some food for your prisoners.
I thought they might be hungry.
They're not really going
to be hanged, are they?
I have an order.
The problem with whores
is we just want bedrock...
something certain, something good,
to get us out of the mess that we've made.
I thought you, on that day,
riding in with that spotless red jacket...
Anyway, I know you'll do the right thing.
Wait.
The smells in the church
caught my attention.
I... I thought a lady... a woman...
It's rosewater.
Ahh!
Good on you.
Butter knife.
They gave me a butter knife.
Eating like that in front of your men
might come across as callous.
Is that you talking or them, Sundown?
Man: We're waiting on our wages, sir.
Told there are others
who will pay if you don't.
Lend us your knife, friend.
That won't do the trick.
Dumb as a doorknob, mate.
Tell him, Sundown. Tell
him we ain't playing.
Tell him we're cold. We're hungry.
Yeah, tell him, Sundown, tell him. Um...
If you don't, I will.
You put some money in our hands right now
or we're gonna have a problem.
We're all hungry. We're all cold.
This is something that only money can fix,
but we're surrounded by it.
The mines.
Millions of years ago,
the good lord saw fit to
put all that gold down there.
And now, men are just yanking it up,
randomly, out of the ground.
Men like Bill Haskell.
If you'll indulge me,
I say we just go and pay him
and his mine a little visit.
After that, I can assure you,
we'll all be eating sirloin.
Here.
Here, Sundown.
If anything ever happens to me,
my half of the claim is yours.
That's a right strange thing to say.
And whatever gold I pulled
out goes to my mother.
Address is in there in
some of the letters I wrote.
Something you want to talk about?
You see, the older a man gets,
the more knowledge he accumulates
that dirties his view of the world...
a bunch of stuff you
don't need in your head
that takes away the innocence.
No, Meek.
There's nothing I want
to talk to you about.
You're good just as you are.
Move away from the entrance.
I'm unarmed.
So was Epstein.
You were after my claim from the beginning.
Was it worth it? Huh?
Was it worth it?!
You don't understand.
What?
Suffering.
Goodman! Goodman!
Where the hell is he?!
Where the hell is he?!
He's got nowhere to run.
Winter will eat him up alive.
I need your dogs, Gorna!
You can't be stupid enough
to think you're actually
going out in this weather.
Only way I'm gonna find him.
Is it difficult...
To get blood out?
You can get the blood out of most things.
Except silk... I don't think...
A man come at me.
They do that, don't they?
Men.
They come at you.
Haskell's gone off to the wilderness.
What, in the dark?
By himself, too.
Carrot.
Carrot.
You're catching on.
Bar-chine.
Them "bars."
Feed-o.
"Freedom."
I...
Give.
Nem.
Name.
Feed-o.
You'll name your child "freedom."
I hope you have many sons.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
The tlingit... we have to release them.
You must be drunk.
They're to be hanged tomorrow.
Strip me of my uniform if you want.
I will not a party to murder.
Son of a... hey!
Hey!
the ones that are wise,
are rendered weak by power.
Hanging from the
gallows po-o-o-le
are only meant to manipulate,
beguile, entertain.
Woman:  from the gallows po-o-o-le
Like wolves, we'll pick away
at them around the edges...
Woman:  hanging from the
gallows po-o-o-o-o-o-le
hanging from the
gallows po-o-o-o-o-o-le
You made the right decision, sir.
Get some food in your belly
for you and your beloved.
And, you can't eat gold, now, can you?
Especially if you don't got none.
Yep.
Hey!
Get a whiskey for me and my friend here.
I'm buying.
Fare thee well to loved ones
farewell to...
Ahh!
Well, I best be moving along.
I got other business to attend to.
Man: I hope you fare better than me.
I had nothing but bad
fortune with that claim.
Fortune's got nothing to do with it.
Fortune's a bitch.
Well, better luck next time.
Man: Watch out your piss
doesn't freeze in midair.
It can climb back inside
you before you know it.
- Shut up.
- It'll kill you.
Yeah.
What the hell?! We got
shot! Hand me my rifle!
Wait up, God damn it!
They're coming for the bracers!
Bill: Hike! Hike!
Hike! Hike!
Keep on!
Go ahead! Go ahead! Good dogs!
Whoa-a-a-a-a!
Whoa!
Goodman!
Goodman!
Come out and meet me man-to-man!
Where's the law?
Went out... all of them.
Hunt tlingit.
Count and his men, too.
Raced right out of here.
Is Meredith suddenly helping out the law?
No, they ain't.
What are you talking about?
Count and his men...
they weren't going after natives.
They was going after Bill Haskell.
Are you gonna shoot your way out?
Take his dogs.
Get his gun.
I could shoot you.
Kill him.
Shoot him yourself.
If only you had a gun, huh?
- I feel bad for you, mate.
- Yeah, I wouldn't.
Let's go!
Get the guns on it!
Let's go! Come on!
Well, this is a bit of a predicament.
You come near me, I'll kill you.
Hike!
Hike!
A thousand to one, we make it to Dawson.
I say we work together.
Ow!
Or we could do that.
We do that, if you want...
we can turn this into a fight.
Killing you'd take too much energy.
Oh.
You got any matches?
No?
You got gloves, though, don't you? Eh?
- You gonna kill me for those?
- Maybe.
Maybe not.
You want to give me one?
Correct me if I'm wrong...
all right, I might be mistaken...
but... Dawson's that way, right?
Forest will cover us from the wind.
Yeah, but it will add 10 more miles.
I don't want to be out in this
cold any longer than I have to.
You know what I mean?
You stay out here in this
wind when you shortcut it,
you'll freeze fast.
There's cold, and then there's cold.
Really suggest you come with me.
You're just trying to
keep me close, aren't you?
So I don't get to that claim before you.
You go that way, I don't
got to worry about you.
Well, then, you should be
encouraging me, shouldn't you?
I don't like seeing men die.
Doesn't matter who they are.
You know, a few extra right turns
and I might have been you.
Kiss Belinda for me.
Man: There he is!
Hyah!
Pain stretches out like
the body's being crushed.
You pray for oblivion,
for the numbness of death.
Have we all come here
for the wrong reasons?
If he doesn't stop, bring him down.
Hey!
Hyah! Hyah!
Hyah!
Bring him down!
Get him! Hyah!
Ah!
Whoa!
Hey!
He-e-y!
Stay down!
Where is he?
You won't get any medical
help unless you talk.
You understand?
He was headed for him. Had to be.
There's a valley that way.
Out of the wind with trees for shelter
and a creek for water.
Be the sort of place a
man of the land would hide.
Let's go!
Hey!
He-e-e-e-y!
He-e-e-e-y!
Belinda: Hike!
Hike!
Hike!
Hike!
Hike!
Hike!
Hey, there! Whoa!
Go!
Hike!
Go!
Go! Hike!
Hike!
Hike!
Go!
Hike!
Mm.
Oh, hell.
Better than confession, shitting.
No offense, lord.
Purges a man of all that's
ungodly and untoward.
It's that one right there.
Yeah. There it is.
Come on, get in there.
There's gold here.
If you call a couple of ounces "gold."
Yielding pounds, not ounces
what the hell are you guys doing in here?
Where's the rest?
It ain't yours to take.
That's where you're wrong, friend.
Whoa!
Take him upstairs.
Mary, hot water... I want
every goddamn drop in Dawson.
Yes, ma'am.
Sir!
Keep on!
Mary, that's nowhere near enough.
I know. It takes time to heat.
There is no time!
Coffee service from the kitchen, tea...
anything, Mary, just go! Go. Go!
Now you stay with me.
Grab everything.
Haskell.
Don't just stand there!
Open your eyes!
Open your eyes.
More, goddamn it!
He's dying.
More!
Haskell.
Haskell!
Go!
Whoa!
Forget the rest! Only him!
Hyah! Giddap!
Come on! Giddap!
Hyah!
Sure... thing.
Sure thing what?
To be in the business,
I'll probably need to shove
his ass out of the fire.
Thank you.
You don't value your life enough,
throwing it away for revenge.
You got too much good in you.
Wonder.
Things in me now aren't
the things I came up with.
They're sharp-edged...
Burning...
like they're trying to
eat the meat off my bones
from the inside.
I want to keep you here in
this very room till spring.
Buy you the first ticket out...
so you don't become like the rest of them.
Let's do this one last time.
Everyone knows this claim's yielded,
and I know that that gold
hasn't gone into town.
I got people in places
who knows who's weighing what where,
who's selling what where.
And your gold ain't sold.
Where is it?
I'm gonna tell you again, there
ain't no gold in that bench.
There ain't no gold in this camp.
The only thing you're gonna
pull out of this camp is shit,
and you're welcome to that.
We ain't gaming no more, friend.
Where... is... it?
You may be stupid, but
you're smart enough to know
gold ain't worth dying for.
Well, by that logic,
it ain't worth killing
for, either, now, is it?
Enter.
Thank you.
The hell's going on?
Something you got no part of.
Go on.
You got that killing look.
Maybe I do, maybe I don't.
Maybe I'm just trying to scare someone
so something doesn't
happen that don't need to.
Goodman.
- You go on, Bill.
- Son of a bitch came back.
Couldn't hack the wilderness.
I'm the one who's gonna
handle this, you understand?
This is my fi...
Well, go ahead, shoot.
I shot your son-of-a-bitch
friend, all right?
Why?
Why do you think?
I got there first.
I was on 152 before it was 152.
I stood right on that ground.
But you didn't stake it.
That's 'cause I didn't see what you saw.
There's no reason in the
world it should have been you.
So, a man just... gets tired
of being dealt crappy cards
by the universe, you know?
So, come on, son.
You get on with it.
I ain't gonna do any killing today.
Yeah, you are.
Somebody's gonna.
You can sure bet somebody's gonna.
Don't.
He's bullshitting.
He's not.
Shut up, Haskell. You don't say nothing.
It was my fight.
And you thought it would
bring your friend back.
Did it?
The day's gonna come where
you're gonna get out of here,
carrying your gold and all the rest.
What I just did is make
sure that you don't leave
with the weight of killing a man, as well.
And yet, you're willing to carry it.
I ain't getting into heaven, Haskell.
I burned those bridges long ago.
Man: Forgive me for my sins, Father.
Father Judge: You're forgiven.
Don't you want to hear them first?
From you, swift water, no.
I suffer from... from
greed and avarice and, uh...
They're the same thing. You're forgiven.
I spend it on booze and on women.
You're forgiven.
You're dying, ain't you?
Near to it.
Hey, you want in on something?
Dawson City, it... it's done.
Go home.
Now, see, that's what I'm getting at, see.
Now, what if I was to tell you
that I was privy to a new rush?
An even hotter one... nome.
Well, just try saying a few
hail marys on the way up.
Well, thank you, Father.
I actually feel better.
Well, then, maybe my trip up here
wasn't a complete waste of time.
What?
Nothing.
Father, I hope you didn't just say
what I think you just said.
'Cause if you ain't got no hope,
no one does.
Thank you, Father.
Let's go!
Crap.
Could've used you not two minutes ago.
Whatcha talking about, Step?
Claim 152, right?
Gave me a take it or leave
it at 50 cents on the dollar.
I didn't know, Haskell!
Hm.
Meeker!
Meeker?!
I'm done with the Klondike.
I want to go a place where there's oranges.
Oranges all year round.
Men don't kill each other for oranges.
And they're a hell of a lot
more beautiful than gold.
Sundown did this.
He turned over the whole claim.
And they got the gold.
All of it.
Almost the whole claim.
Stroke of luck.
I wouldn't have thought of it
if I hadn't been purging
my gut at the time.
God bless you, Joe Meeker.
Oh!
Are you gonna get it or am I?
I'd say that qualifies us
as being rich men, wouldn't you?
Only if you get out with it.
Ain't no boat coming till the river thaws.
Don't know if I can wait four
months to get out of this hole.
Four months of fighting off
sons of bitches like Sundown.
Fighting for wood.
Fighting off mother nature.
I'm tired of fighting, Bill.
I just want to go.
Then let's do it.
What, now?
Now.
- Overland?
- Overland.
Huh. That's suicide.
Only if it kills you.
I knew I liked you, Bill.
There just ain't no "no" in you.
Might be the finest compliment
anyone's ever paid me.
I'm headed out, brother.
I wish I was taking you with me.
I guess I am, in a way.
We were richer, then, weren't we?
When we had nothing in our pockets,
just a head full of hope.
That's what I'll carry...
what we were in that moment in time.
Worth more than anything
any man could ever pull out of the ground.
You watch over me.
I'm going home.
Bring him.
Bill: If they're hanging him
for the death of my friend,
they got the wrong guy.
Oh, they got the right guy.
He murdered a mountie.
Justice will be served.
Tlingit might disagree.
You're a worldly man, Father,
but sometimes justice doesn't
just need to be justice.
Sometimes justice needs to be seen.
Pity you, killing for another man's agenda.
No.
You put two of my men in the ground.
And I lost men, as well.
Who wins?
Perhaps they've killed us both.
I'm headed out.
I heard.
I heard you bought up
everything at the dry-goods
store in preparation.
It turns out gold has some uses, after all.
Come with me.
Is that some sort of proposal, Mr. Haskell?
- It's halfway to it.
-
Younger version of me
jumped into your arms...
but I come too far, Bill.
My whole life,
trying to get a piece of something.
Well, I got it.
I got it here.
Everything I got invested
in the Fairview Hotel...
Sell it.
Hell,  I'll buy it from you.
That makes exactly no sense, Haskell.
Who gives a God damn about sense?
Sense never got anyone anywhere.
There's sense in the world.
If I go back to the states, I'm a...
I'm a midwife...
or a laundry girl.
I can't even vote.
There's no place in the
world for a woman down there.
There's a place with me.
No, there's not, Bill.
Not for me.
You'll make it out.
You know how I know?
'Cause you're too damn good
for the Yukon, Bill Haskell.
-
- You gonna be all right?
Well, physically, no.
But I still have high hopes for the spirit.
Thank you.
Take care of him.
You ready?
No. But yep.
Hike! Hike!
Hike!
Hike! Hike!
Hike!
Father.
I apologize, but I don't
have the energy for a sermon.
Well, that's okay.
What's going on?
We're fitting you for a coffin.
I'm not completely dead yet,
in case you haven't noticed.
You just sit back, relax. Understand?
Bill: Stay, GQ!
Good dog!
Hike!
Good dogs.
The pessimist in me's thinking,
"we're gonna die out here."
What's the optimist say?
"At least there ain't traffic."
Ground's too cold to dig.
Bodies won't go in till spring.
But the ice will keep them cold till then.
- Man: Mr. Capson.
-
Not to be too crass,
but that picture just
made you a lot of money.
You'll no longer be
Head Superintendent of
last chance outpost...
you'll be commissioner of
a far larger department.
Development's coming now.
Bigger population,
more tax revenue to pay
dutiful men like you.
Not me.
What?
The state can't pay a man if
he's no longer in their employ.
You're... what? You're not...
Tendering my resignation.
You've done the hard stuff, Superintendent.
You're quitting at exactly the wrong time.
I can't just find another lawman.
You and I, we have a shorthand.
Well, that's the problem...
that I could have a shorthand
with a man like you at all.
Don't worry, it's not worth anything.
It's just tin.
Bill: Easy! Easy! Whoa!
Let's see what we've got.
River, I think.
Go easy with it.
What?
Just thinking.
Thinking what?
That you hid the gold in shit.
I did, indeed  hide gold in shit.
How many times in the history
of this great human race
do you reckon that's happened?
Precisely never.
Whoa!
Ah!
Every time I start hating mother nature,
she goes and gives me something like this.
I know nothing, Haskell!
I know nothing!
Meek!
Aah!
Aaah!
Whoever it is that puts
us through this struggle...
whether it's God, the land
...Why do you do it to us?
Coffin's ready, Father.
Father, come on now.
Come on, Father.
One, two, and...
Here we go. Good man.
Bit premature, don't you think?
See, now, that's problem
with funerals, Father...
always happen way too late.
Funeral's the biggest
moment of a man's life!
Everybody weeping, hollering,
saying what a good soul he was,
only he's never around to see it.
You think this is necessary?
Just lay down, will you?
Let him give something back to you, okay?
Joshua fit the battle of
Jericho, Jericho, Jericho
Joshua fit the battle of Jericho
the walls came tumblin' down
Another season passing through
while the world goes on.
and even if you somehow make
it through and spring comes,

You got any citrus?
There gold?
Everywhere.
You just got to know where to look for it.
does the struggle and the
hardship make us better?
Man: Is it true, Mr.
London, you lived all this?
They're saying you're the new voice
of American exceptionalism.
Man 2: How much of this is
drawn from what actually happened?
We're busted.
They're all going to Nome, now.
Bypassing Dawson completely.
Never know.
Tomorrow might have
something in it today don't.
and the simplicity of the
world, from a man's needs.
