Whoa. I'll get this ear, and you get on.
Whoa.
Let me get my seat, now.
Whoa, now.
JESS: You got him?
- Yeah.
Have you got him?
All right. Go!
You let him know who you are, boy!
Yeah, boy!
You got him, Joe. You got him!
- That's it, Joe.
JOE: Whoa.
WILLIS:
Kid looks pretty good.
Well, hell.
Yeah, I taught him everything he knows.
How was the war?
Well, it was all right.
How was prison?
Glad to be out.
I'll bet.
Dock still in?
WILLIS: They might let him out of jail
someday if he'd stop trying to escape.
JESS: You'd have done good
if you hadn't pulled leather!
Like hell I did. I ain't touched
a saddle horn in my life.
Howdy, Willis.
Little brother Joe
went and shot up like a weed.
Happens.
You want to try a ride?
Hell, no. I leave that
to you and big brother Jess here.
How much to get your brains
beat out on a saddle?
Same as always.
Dollar a day, beans and hay.
- How long you been out?
- About a year.
- Doing what?
- White boy picking cotton.
Ma's gonna be happy to see you.
Hey, Ma!
Will's home!
WILLIS: Pa around?
- Oh, no. I ain't seen him in weeks.
He's off chasing honey ponds
and fritter trees.
WILLIS:
That'd be James W. Newton, all right.
Everybody says he's a good man.
Just can't nobody figure out
what he's good for.
Mmm.
I been dreaming about your
squirrel dumplings for four years.
And that's the last one, son.
Almost finished breaking
the Ferguson colt?
Yes, ma'am.
He ain't that tough.
We'll have about $ 10
by the end of the week.
He owes us four from last week.
- You gonna go get it?
- Yeah. I will.
Willis, are you gonna stay?
You can help us break some horses.
- Let Willis finish his dinner.
- No, little brother. I'm just staying a bit.
Besides, I ain't horse-crazy like you.
Well, it's nice to see
you ain't changed, Willis.
Well, you should have seen her, Ma.
We was talking about getting married,
living on the 40 acres, the whole bit.
And then some old jealous rat
told her old man...
...that I'd been in the penitentiary,
and that was it.
Cut me off, couldn't see her no more.
He wanted me to stay, work his crop.
I was the best cotton picker he had.
Just didn't want his beautiful daughter
hooked up with an ex-con, was all.
I ain't good enough for his daughter
but I'm good enough to work his crop?
I say, "To hell with you."
I know it ain't fair, son.
But maybe you should've stayed
and tried to work it out.
How? How, Ma?
Like I tried to work it out
in Cottonwood?
When folks that knew me
all my life testified against me...
...and I ain't done nothing?
I'm gonna work
some things out, all right.
If it ain't fair when it's all said and done,
it'll be unfair on my side of the fence.
GLASSCOCK: Where you know him from?
SLIM: We were in the pen together.
His brother stole some cotton,
drug him down with him.
He didn't do nothing.
Kid's green, but he's got guts.
This here's my business associate.
- Brentwood Glasscock.
- Willie Reed.
- Nice to meet you.
- You as well.
There's been a slight change
in plans, fellows.
I went out and got it set up.
We're going in at 12 noon
instead of 12 midnight.
Slim, I didn't travel 300 miles
to stick a gun in someone's face.
Then you can hold the horses.
Night jobs is too much work anyhow.
- Well, I ain't afraid of hard work.
SLIM: This'll be a milk run.
- Mr. Glasscock?
- Hmm?
The chief wanted y'all
to have a drink on him.
- It's Napoleon brandy.
- Thanks.
Heard they hit another pool
south of town.
- Yes, sir. They sure did.
- Who's "they"?
Chief Baconrind,
one of the Osage millionaires.
Last year, they wouldn't let him in here,
but the policy's changed.
WILLIS:
Yeah? Why's that?
GLASSCOCK:
He bought the place.
- Oil, huh?
GLASSCOCK: Mm-hmm.
To Oklahoma, gentlemen.
The Sooner State.
The sooner we get out of here,
the richer we'll be.
- You ain't gonna drink that?
- No.
Lordy, Indians will drink anything.
I prefer to go in at night.
There's more time to do your work,
and there's a lot less people.
Look, there's an easy way to do this
and a hard way.
As long as I'm leader,
we'll do it my way.
Which way is that, Slim?
Relax.
I got this sheriff's pecker in my pocket.
We just cut him in
on the take, that's all.
GLASSCOCK:
I still prefer nights.
Thanks a lot, Alvin.
See you next year.
Thank you, Mr. Williams.
- Howdy.
- Howdy.
Can I help you, sir?
This here's a bank robbery.
I want all your money.
Hands up, everybody.
Come on.
Howdy.
Do us both a favor
and just keep walking. Come on.
Lock him in that vault
and get that boy out of there.
Come on! Let's go! They're leaving!
Why is this happening?
SLIM:
Jesus!
Double-crossing bastard.
GLASSCOCK: Yeah?
- Glass, open up. It's me, Willis.
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.
Anybody see you come up here?
No, I come up the back.
GLASSCOCK:
That's Avis, my wife. This is Will Reed.
- Howdy.
AVIS: Hello.
- Pleased to meet you, ma'am.
- Charmed.
WILLIS:
Sorry to wake you tonight.
Well, they got Slim.
I know.
Newspaper didn't say nothing
about him being dead, though.
WILLIS: What'd we get?
GLASSCOCK: What did you get?
Nothing. I got out alive.
Well, if all we got's mine,
it's not a hell of a lot.
Just some damn Victory bonds.
If we got expenses for Slim, there's not
more than a few thousand.
It's not worth all that aggravation.
I'm with you on the idea
of these night jobs, Glass.
Yeah, now, I figure that
damn Jesse James routine we pulled...
...was over
at the turn of the century.
I tried to tell that idiot
there's less risk in night jobs.
Especially if you work the smaller banks.
But we're gonna get the big banks
because that's where the money's at.
The difference is, we got to do it right.
Yeah, yeah,
we got to scout our locations.
We got to get the best cars,
keep new tires on them, plan our routes.
I can take care
of the getting in and getting out...
...and you got the nitroglycerin, right?
Oh, yeah.
WILLIS:
So that's where you keep that stuff.
Yeah.
Avis is rather fond
of keeping it under the bed.
Aren't you?
These look promising.
None of those are traceable.
I suppose I could give you
Ninety.
Eighty, and I promise never
to tell anybody where they came from.
Eighty would be good.
Eighty-five would be better.
And we promise
never to rob your little bank.
Deal.
Deal.
You know, I'm retiring next month...
...and I've got some information here
that might be valuable...
...to boys in your line of work.
It's a few square-door safes
I know about...
...in this part of the country.
Course, it'll mean a little investment
on your part.
Can I help you?
- I like that Red Cross pin, Avis.
- Thanks.
- You a nurse?
AVIS: I was. That's how I met Brent.
One day he was
just another patient...
...and then I ran off with him,
and, well, here we are, casing a bank.
He takes all them powders and stuff.
He ain't sick or nothing, is he?
No, it's just him.
I wear this for luck.
WILLIS:
How's she look, Glass?
That list is genuine.
I knew that man
was an honest criminal.
We can punch through the drum.
The box is an old Packer.
- You can blow her with the grease, yeah?
- Yeah. Anything with a square door.
It'll take it off there in one pop.
What else is on that list?
Well, we got 41 banks here.
I figure we wait till these marks
are flush with that harvest money...
...and then we take them, one by one.
That's good, huh?
Very good.
Who's gonna handle security?
Now we need security?
While we're in the bank, someone's
gotta be outside, watch our backs.
We'll find somebody.
I reckon I know some fellows
we can count on.
JESS: What?
JOE: I want a soda pop.
JESS:
We'll get a soda pop.
Would you look at this?
My goodness.
Welcome to Omaha, boys.
- Willis.
- What do you say, little brother?
- You look good.
- Yeah? I feel good.
Look at Willis, the city slicker.
- You like that, boy? Like that?
- Well, yeah.
- Why'd you bring that horse stuff?
- You said you had a job for us.
I do have a job for you.
Just not that type of job.
What do you think of Omaha, boys?
Looks good.
Everything looks good
from the seat of a Studebaker.
JESS:
Oh, my. Oh, my... Hello, darling.
Say goodbye to Daddy there.
Say hello to me.
Oh, my goodness.
I like this town.
Look out!
Yep, it cost $ 1900
off the showroom floor...
...but this one's two
on account of these custom disks.
- Can you handle a car like this, Joe?
- Couldn't do no worse.
Good. That'll be part of your job.
Let's get you boys dressed.
- I don't know about this, Jess.
- Let's string him along for a little while.
Yeah, you're looking sharp.
Look at him. Look at him.
Look at him!
WOMAN: What do you do for a living?
- What do you do?
- I'm a manicurist.
- You are? A manicurist.
All right. What do you think
of these nails here?
- You need to come in.
- They need some help, don't they?
- Hey, don't you look all spiffed up!
- I was gonna say the same about you.
Let me introduce you
to these two fine ladies.
This here is Catherine
and this is Madeline.
JOE: Howdy, ma'am.
- Joe and Willis.
- Hi.
- So, what business are you boys in?
That's a mighty fine question.
What kind of businessman
are you, Willie?
A damn successful one.
Now, are you all coming?
Would you like to join us for dinner?
- Sure.
- Okay.
All right, then.
JESS:
Now, I don't tell a lot of people this...
...but I am good friends
with Pancho Villa.
No, it's the truth. That's true.
He comes to Texas, I go to Mexico,
we drink together.
He's always catching hell in the papers.
He's a great man.
A great man, Pancho Villa.
A friend of mine.
You ever had a steak so thick?
Mm-mm.
No way, Willis.
I ain't never broke the law. The saddle's
hard, but at least it's honest.
I ain't never broke the law neither,
and they gave me three years for it.
What about them watermelons
and chickens? That hog?
WILLIS: I ain't talking about that.
- It's about taking other people's money.
Not people's money.
The bank's money.
Banks have been dealing dirt
to our people since before we was born.
- It's time we dealt some back.
- Farmers got their money in there.
Insurance companies.
See, all the banks is insured now,
and that's who takes the loss.
Hell, they are the biggest crooks
of them all.
We are just little thieves stealing
from the big thieves.
That's all.
Have you turned the little Baptist yet?
We've got two pieces of cake
over there, and they do have a friend.
It just don't figure up to me, that's all.
Pa's doing his clean-living routine.
It's rubbing off on the kid.
WILLIS:
Yeah.
Well, if the kid ain't up for it...
It ain't like I'm afraid.
JOE: How's it look?
- Pretty dead.
Yeah?
Only an idiot would be out
on a night like this.
I don't know, Jess.
If somebody comes,
I don't think I can pull this trigger.
Listen, we're gonna do what we talked
about. We're not gonna kill anybody.
That's why we got these loaded
with bird shot.
Just gonna get this over with,
and then we'll get back to that cake.
All right?
- All right.
- All right.
GLASSCOCK: Light the fuse right after
you pour it, and pour it very steady.
Because if you get a gap in that liquid...
...it's gonna blow off crooked
and jam up.
See, dynamite blows out
in all directions...
...but nitro shoots straight out.
Anything that's not nailed down in here
is going right out that door over there.
WILLIS:
How long you been doing this?
Too damn long.
According to the odds and the gods...
...you only get to make one mistake
with this.
Then they walk
around the edge of the crater...
...and if they find a finger or toe...
...that's what they bury.
We should probably leave now.
JOE: What if they
blow themselves up in there?
Well, I reckon you'll be the first to know.
WILLIS:
Whoo!
Stop that noise!
- Who are you? What are you doing?
- Go back to bed.
I got a fire siren up here.
Do you hear me?
There ain't no fire.
If you don't tell me what you're doing,
I'm gonna crank it up.
- You touch the damn siren, I'll blow...
- Sorry to wake you, ma'am.
We're repairmen.
We're here trying to fix the lock.
No, you're not.
Not at 2:00 in the morning.
Touch the damn siren...
...I'm gonna blow your whole building
to kingdom come!
Hey, I said, turn that off!
You're bank robbers,
that's what you are!
Somebody catch these men.
They robbed the bank!
- Don't make me come up there!
- You're mean, you know that?
WOMAN: Stop these men!
GLASSCOCK: Whole town's...
...gonna be here in a minute.
- Jess!
JESS: What?
Get in there and carry that silver.
Get it all. Whoo!
JESS: Where?
WILLIS: Behind the smoke!
Catch them. They robbed the bank!
That's my money in that bank.
- Well, it's our money now.
WOMAN: No!
Go back to bed. All y'all.
All is well.
All is well.
WILLIS:
Pick your feet up, boy!
JOE: It's like lead shot.
- When I was your age...
...I could've passed you
running backwards with that load.
- Get it all?
JOE: Still a calendar in there.
I got them idiots
shooting at each other! Hee-hee!
It's a hell of a way to make a living.
I wanna ship this back to Texas, miss.
Well, whatever you say, Tex.
Ain't you a little young
to be running a hotel?
Well, ain't you a little young
to be staying here all by yourself?
Yeah.
Good evening, ma'am.
What can I get for you?
WILLIS:
You got any out-of-town papers?
No, sorry.
You might want to try the depot.
I tell you what.
How about that one right there?
- The
WILLIS: Yeah. Sounds good.
Let me get that for you.
I was gonna say
only criminals read the tabloids...
...but you don't look like
any criminal I ever met.
Well, you'd be right about that.
- Nickel for the paper?
- Yes, please.
So, what's fun to do in Omaha?
Well, you could chew gum.
It's been nice chatting with you,
but I have to close up now.
Looks like we're going
to the same place.
Piece of Wrigley's?
KAT: Hey, Louise.
- Hey, Kat. How are you doing?
Howdy. Will Reed.
Old friend of Louise's here.
- Hi there.
- So how do you two know each other?
Well, that is a wild story.
I'll let you tell it.
Boy, that is a wild story, isn't it?
Matter of fact,
it was 16 years ago to the week.
I was frog-gigging
right down in Gracey Creek.
Who do I see
bogged down to her knees in mud...
...with a frog stuck
on the end of her gig...
...but Miss Louise here.
Boy, we got a lot of catching up to do.
Yeah, I guess we do. We do.
Louise, frog-gigging.
Two on a match?
No, thank you.
I make it a habit to stay too busy.
Busy doing what? Gigging frogs?
No, I'm an oil man.
Really? You have oil wells and all that?
Yep. Working on one right now.
She's a real wildcat.
You have quite a line, Mr. Reed.
WILLIS:
Well, my friends call me Willis, Louise.
You ever hear of this place
called the Argosy Ballroom?
Yeah.
What do you say you and I go there
on Saturday night?
- I have to tell you something.
WILLIS: What's that?
I have a son.
- Really?
- Yeah.
What's his name?
His name is Lewis.
He's 10 years old.
His father died in the war.
I love kids.
Why don't you bring him along.
We'll go to the picture show instead.
I think he would like that
very much.
And you?
There you are. Sorry I'm late.
- Arthur, this is Mr. Reed.
- Will Reed. Pleased to meet you.
Arthur Adams.
Arthur owns the cigar stand
where I work.
You ready to go?
There's more money in that pile
than Pa made in his whole life.
Well, you got that right.
As long as you're telling Louise you're
an oil man, why don't you just be one.
Hell, I will be soon. If you boys
are smart, you'll invest with me.
Oil, huh?
Well, good luck to the both of you.
Any money I make I'm putting
into stocks and bonds.
You're what?
Silk stockings and bonded whiskey.
At least till I get myself killed.
- You want Avis to carry your share?
- No.
Put that thing away, Jess.
Nobody knows us around here.
Yeah, who's that?
DOCK:
The laws.
Looking for a bunch of no-good Newton.
WILLIS: So you finally
wore them tracking dogs down.
God almighty!
Dock, you son of a bitch!
JESS: They finally let you out?
- "Let"?
- Hell, I escaped.
- It's damn good to see you.
It's good to see you, brother.
Well, who's this?
Joe.
- Your brother.
- Joe!
Joe, I haven't seen you in a long time.
Damn if this don't call
for a celebration.
- Willis, you weren't lying in that letter?
- Hell, no.
Got 5000 in cash
and 3000 in bonds on this mark here.
Well, to hell with picking cotton.
- Goddamn it, Willis.
- Aw, couldn't take a little...
DOCK:
Joseph, Joseph.
JOE:
You got my hair, you...
What about Willie Hart?
William Hart's good,
but I like Tom Mix better.
Tom Mix?
Yeah, but them outfits he wears
is kind of fruity, don't you think?
He can rope and ride
better than any of them.
I want to be a cowboy when I grow up,
but Mother says I have to stay in school.
Your ma's right. You don't stay in school,
you'll end up picking cotton all your life.
- That don't sound like much fun, does it?
- No.
- So, what's next?
- Could we get a chocolate soda?
Lewis!
How about a triple chocolate soda
with a scoop of ice cream?
- Okay.
- That sound good?
I'll race you for it. Ready, set, go.
Watch it. There's your ma.
JESS: Whoo! I got him, Joe.
I got him. It's like a six-pointer.
JOE:
Yeah.
Some hunting season
this turned out to be.
WILLIS: I tell you what, boys.
We hit every bank on this list...
...and I guarantee
we make enough cash to retire.
Then y'all get to do
all the hunting you want.
What do we need Glasscock around for?
There's enough of us.
Well, I'll tell you why.
He knows his grease and every criminal
between Canada and Mexico.
While you two are farting around,
him and Avis are off scouting the marks.
We should get
in the booze business.
Everybody knows the big money's
in bootlegging now.
- Where will all that money end up?
- I don't know.
In a bank, that's where.
Willis thinks it ain't wrong,
because all them banks is insured.
To hear him tell it,
you'd think we were doing them a favor.
If nobody ever robbed a bank, the
insurance companies would go broke...
...because nobody would need them.
- That's right.
I take it you ain't working today, Jess?
What's she read, Joe?
Fourteen-six, since the last time.
All right. This getaway map's
got to be perfect.
We should be able to drive this route
with the headlamps off.
When do we get out, Willis?
Where does it end?
When we're millionaires, that's when.
How much is a million dollars, exactly?
A million, Hoss, is a one...
...and that many zeros.
JESS: You got more guns and running,
got more crime, and it just ain't worth it.
DOCK:
You done yet?
I'm just giving this fellow my opinion
of this new Prohibition.
You're no less of a drunk now
than when it was legal.
That's my point. That law
ain't really doing its job, is it?
Let's go, Jess.
- You got a wife?
- Mm-hm.
- You got kids?
- Mm-hm.
All right. Here you go.
Now, if I get arrested,
you've got to bail me out.
- Mm-hm. Mm-hm.
- All right, all right.
Have a good night.
Who knew making money the easy way
would be so damn much trouble?
It's colder than a bull's balls
in a blue norther.
It's colder than a day-old dumpling.
Colder than Pa's ass at plowing time.
Well, I guess this may encourage folks
to write more often.
- Well, boys, it's our lucky night.
- Oh, yeah?
Yeah. I was up
on that pole, thinking.
I decided we'll get
that other bank too.
Hell, Willis. I'm tired already.
What are you talking about?
Both banks, and at the same time. It's so
cold, there won't even be a dog barking.
Jess, go with Glass. Dock, come with
me. Joe, you soldier the whole street.
All right?
- Two banks?
- Yeah. What do you say?
- Okay.
- All right.
Glass, what's your watch say?
Willis, are you positive
you can blow that safe?
Sure he can.
Why you got to question
every damn thing?
When the 2:40 freight whistle blows,
light your fuse.
Then let's get the hell out of here
to someplace warmer.
Well, let's go, boys.
DOCK: Willis?
WILLIS: Yeah?
- Do you know the money's in there?
WILLIS: It's a bank, ain't it?
Stand back and let me show you
the two-step method.
What are you talking about?
Step one.
Step two.
That's an awful big shot you're pouring.
Yep.
Like Ma always said...
...God hates a coward.
Whoa, mister.
Whoa, now. Whoa.
- You're gonna have to go another way.
- There ain't no other way.
Turn around. It ain't safe.
I'm too tired for your nonsense.
Get out of my way, boy.
Giddap there!
You are a real desperado, Joe.
I told him it wasn't safe.
But you said he...
...he threatened to...
What was it?
Blow up your entire family
with dynamite?
Well, now, that was just at first.
I can't remember too much,
but he was friendly, kind of funny.
You know we sent out a posse,
and that airplane too.
Yeah. I know.
Believe me, these fellows are long gone.
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Mr. Aldrich.
I'll buy all of that gum.
- Well, hello, stranger.
WILLIS: Hello, Lou.
I'll buy the whole damn cigar stand.
One of my wells just come in.
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.
If your boss isn't here, I'll slip a hundred
in the till for the daily profits...
...sneak you out,
we take a slow drive in the country.
Willis, I don't know.
- Two hundred. Three hundred...
MAN: Will Reed?
That's him. He's one of them.
I'll be back in just a second, love.
Ma'am, gentlemen. Can I help you?
Come upstairs.
Explain what's in your room.
I don't see
how that's any of your business.
But come to think of it,
shouldn't be a problem.
What did they do?
They just searched me,
made me put this on.
WILLIS:
Well, get it off.
- What for?
- Because you got a...
MAN:
That's them, all right.
I know them voices anywhere.
Had on that same red sweater.
Thank you very much, sir.
Take him on back down.
Lying son of a bitch!
I ain't never seen that man in my life.
Tomorrow morning,
you boys will be indicted...
...for robbing the motion picture theater.
If you got a statement to make,
I'll be down the hall.
JOE:
I got a statement for you.
- That old man can't even see!
WILLIS: Settle down, Joe.
We didn't rob no damn picture show
and you know it.
Yelling ain't gonna do us no good.
They got us here.
We got to figure out
how to get out of here.
We wasn't within 500 miles
of here. They can't prove it.
Hell, boy, they just did.
Hey, don't you get it?
This here's a shakedown.
Congratulations on your first one.
They already got that 2000
from our room.
Which is three times the amount
that was stole from the picture show.
Willis.
When I was growing up, you and Dock,
you was off in the penitentiary...
...God knows where else.
I never knew it was like this.
Lord help me, I never knew.
Well, it is, little brother. It is.
But don't you worry, though,
because we're gonna get more.
Now, I'm about to show you...
...why we wear...
...our savings account.
Jailer! Let me out of here.
I've got a confession.
So you're not an oil man, are you?
What do you mean?
Well, you know,
there's talk around the hotel...
...and all that money they found
in your room.
All that money? Me and my brothers
made that money gambling.
You're a gambler?
No, I am no such thing.
I'm just making money right now
playing high-stakes poker and such...
...so I can be that oil man.
Hey, little darling.
Now, I have a question for you.
What I am is a businessman, like a lawyer
or someone playing the stock market.
I'm just making a living.
Do you follow me?
Yeah, okay.
All right.
I thought you boys
said you were oil men.
That's a lie! You hear about
those two banks in Hondo, Texas?
We did that.
He robbed one, I robbed the other.
I said, "Let's get them both."
- We're rich.
- Yeah, and goddamn you, Uncle Sam.
I am a veteran.
I fought the Kaiser near single-handed.
- My brother, the war hero.
- Hell, yeah.
Never got out of camp.
- Don't interrupt!
- Just New Jersey.
I can outdrink, outride and outrope
any member of this congregation.
I will lick any man that says different.
I will lick you if you say different.
WILLIS:
Ninety-four, 95.
MAN:
Well, hell, yeah, there's a pattern.
One, they've all been robbed.
And two, my company had to pay out.
And now it's up to the federal
government to bail you out, right?
Square-door safes blown with precision,
no rough stuff...
...couple of men outside for security...
And the few watchmen they've taken...
...say they're just a bunch of "please"
and "thank you" country boys.
If I got that much money in two years,
I believe I'd say "thank you" too.
Half the banks are clipping the association
for a hell of a lot more than was stolen.
Bankers think it's a license to steal
now that they're all insured.
Just double the premiums on any bank
that won't spring for a round safe.
MAN:
That's just fine.
In the meantime, what is my government
gonna do about this bunch?
We're after them.
And when we catch them,
we're gonna put them away.
JESS: Are we there yet?
JOE: Get back to sleep. You're next.
- So how'd we do, anyway?
- I don't know. We've done better.
- We'll do the count in the morning.
JOE: All right. Get some sleep.
WILLIS:
Night, boys.
Willis Newton.
If it ain't my old partner.
Seems you done all right for yourself.
Get yourself a top-notch crew and all.
Well, Slim, the only crew
I got's drilling for oil.
- So how the hell are you?
SLIM: Can't complain.
Thought we might talk a little business.
- So where you working these days?
SLIM: Chicago. Things are hopping there.
Big fix is in. Cops, politicians, judges.
Hell, they even bought the World Series.
- Boy, you must be in heaven.
SLIM: Yeah.
Could put you onto some sweet
business opportunities.
We even have a mutual friend.
Murray, one of your laundry fellows.
Slim, those days
are pretty much over for me.
But I do appreciate the offer.
Yeah. If for any reason
things don't turn out how you figured...
...Iook me up in Chicago.
There was some creep outside earlier
who wanted to talk to you.
It was just some old guy I knew
way back when.
Why are you sitting in the dark?
Hey, what's the matter?
What's wrong, baby?
Willis, do you trust me?
Tell me what happened.
Did he say something to upset you?
No.
I went to the bank today to put
your business things in the deposit box.
I didn't want to fold the oil lease papers,
but the box was too small, so I opened it.
Willis, there was so much
money in there.
I know you haven't
made any money in oil yet...
...and you can't be winning
that kind of money gambling.
And I've seen you sign in at hotels
under all these different names.
Reed, Rogers...
I found something in your jacket
that said your name was Newton.
Reed isn't your name, is it?
Why, Lou?
I don't even know your real name?
That doesn't matter.
It's part of my business.
- Am I just a part of your business?
- Don't say that.
What is your business?
You know what my business is.
I don't think I do.
Anyway, I put all that money
in a savings account.
- You what?
- It's too much money to be put in a box.
No. No, no.
You really shouldn't have done that.
Why not? The deposit box
is in my name.
You put the car in my name.
When it comes to money,
do what I tell you.
If it's in my name, I have a right.
Listen, I got that money
from a bank robbery.
From robbing a bank!
Are you happy now?
You trying to get me thrown in the pen?
They can track that stuff.
You're a bank robber?
My God, I'm in love with you.
A bank robber? And a big liar!
Don't act like I'm the only one
that's been telling stories around here.
- What?
- What?
Like Lewis' daddy
being killed in the war. Yeah.
He's still around somewhere.
You're still married to him.
You don't know anything about my life.
You have no idea.
No, I don't,
and you weren't gonna tell me.
At least I'm not stealing from anyone
or almost getting killed.
Goddamn it, Lou.
I was born into nothing.
Nobody ever gave me nothing, neither.
So it's real simple.
You do what you got to do,
and I do what I got to do.
But you're a bank robber.
Yeah.
I rob banks. That's what I do.
It's what I'll keep doing until I make
enough money from my oil business.
Louise...
I love you.
I want to be together all the time.
When I think of us,
I'm thinking about forever.
Then why didn't you tell me?
I was afraid you'd leave me.
I wouldn't have left you.
No matter how much money
you have...
...you've got nothing if you can't trust
someone as close to you as I am.
Do you understand that?
Yeah.
I tell you what.
This next trip we're going up to Toronto,
and I want you to come with me.
What?
I'm in love with a man
and I don't know his name.
WILLIS: You do too.
- No, I don't.
Name is Mr. Newton,
and you are my Mrs. Newton.
The guns go down under here...
...under a douche bag.
The customs man won't touch it.
The nitroglycerin,
do you carry that too?
No.
Do you ever get afraid?
I mean, what if they get caught?
That's not a lucky question.
Evening, ma'am.
What?
Mosler, son of a bitch,
is 11 inches thick.
When I started, you could punch
through a vault door with a jimmy bar.
Could they not sing?
It's gonna take a lot of explosives
to blow that.
That's all right.
We got a hell of a lot of explosives.
Can I be brutally honest with you, Willis?
Shoot, Glass.
Never mind.
Damn.
Son of a bitch
looks 11 inches thick to me.
What the hell have we got here?
- How do you get that open?
- You don't.
A month ago, they didn't have
a round safe.
These are worthless.
Damn it, Glass. Don't tell me
we come all the way to Canada for this.
You blink your eyes
and everything changes.
Registered goddamn bonds,
controls on explosives...
...round-door safe, cannonball safe...
...goddamn Bureau of Investigation
chasing you across state lines.
Oh, God, what did I do?
I thought you said you didn't smoke.
I didn't say that.
I said it was a waste of time.
Just like this whole damn trip to Canada.
Well, what about our vacation?
Hey, come on, let's get off here.
Come on.
I'm glad they're changing the safes. You
said you were done with all that anyway.
JESS:
It's right out there on the street?
It's dumb. These Canucks
take all the currency to one place.
They count it, then walk the shit
right back out in the street.
GLASSCOCK: What about guards?
- Ain't no guards!
JOE:
No guards?
- Two Canucks and the money.
- Just stick a gun in their face.
- Boom. Simple snatch and run.
- Like stealing Tobe Roberts' watermelons.
- Hey there, Louise.
DOCK: Hey, Lou.
WILLIS: Just talking to the boys
about a little business.
- How you doing?
JOE: Howdy, ma'am.
I never thought we'd go back to this
broad-daylight, Dalton Boys kind of thing.
What, your stomach
bothering you, Glass?
This'll be a lead-pipe cinch, boys.
Everybody know what to do?
I think I know the plan.
You grab the bag and we'll protect you.
- So is this the spot?
- Yeah.
Little bit more, Joe.
I thought it was right back there.
Little bit more.
We ain't gonna get that one bag.
We're getting all them bags.
- Go to hell. That ain't the plan.
- Plan just changed. We're getting it all.
Oh, shit.
Here they all come.
Dock, get him.
Glass, Jess, you take them two.
I got this one coming right at us.
Well, come on, you sons of bitches.
You want to live forever?
Drop the bag or I'll blow you
straight to hell. Drop it!
Drop the bag and get your hands up.
Let's go.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Give me the bag. Give me the bag!
- It's a holdup!
- Shit.
WILLIS:
Drop it.
Drop it, goddamn it.
You know, you are stupid
sons of bitches.
BANK MESSENGER:
Get him!
Don't move.
MAN 1:
Call the police.
MAN 2: Police!
MAN 3: They've got guns!
Hold it right there!
What are you doing with that damn gun?
Shit! Goddamn it!
God...!
Get off me,
you ignorant Canuck bastard!
Get off my leg.
Get the hell out of here,
you son of a bitch. Get out.
Get off my leg. Goddamn it. Shit!
Jesus!
Let him go.
Get out of here!
- Hold it right there.
- Drop the goddamn gun.
Let's go, let's go, let's go!
Joe.
Come on. Go.
- Drive!
- Get Dock on the way.
Let's go, let's go!
- Let's go.
- Come on.
DOCK:
Where the hell were you?
GLASSCOCK: Jesus.
JESS: Damn it.
GLASSCOCK: Gosh.
JOE: What was that back there?
You trying to kill us all?
What a fiasco.
Everybody in Toronto saw us, Willis.
We sure didn't see you.
Where the hell were you,
you yellow bastard?
Didn't fire a shot.
Listen to me, idiot.
I'm not supposed to fire a shot.
You're not supposed to fire a shot.
We're supposed to be backup.
If you'd backed up any more,
you'd be in Chicago.
- I'm a professional, I stick to the plan.
JOE: What plan?
WILLIS:
Everybody, shut up. It ain't over yet.
Got it? We'll see you two
back in the States.
GLASSCOCK: Why not call the radio,
tell them we're coming?
JOE: Stupid.
DOCK: He had no idea what was going on.
- Where was he?
JESS: I know.
I thought you were dead.
They made an announcement at
the track. Everybody's talking about it.
- I'm fine.
- They said one of the gang was dead.
Nobody was hurt. We got away.
Willis, we've got to get out of here.
I was so stupid today, Lou.
I wanted it all.
I almost got my brothers killed.
I don't know...
I don't know how we got out alive, Lou.
Hey, I know that gal.
Went to Sunday school with her.
In Parsons.
How much you think was in those bags?
Whatever it is, it ain't worth it.
"All four wounded bank employees
have been treated."
WILLIS:
Bunch of stupid, thick-headed Canucks.
"Six bandits got away
with an estimated $200,000."
Hell, maybe 80.
The Canucks are pencil-whipping
insurance companies just like back home.
Tell me, who's the criminals here?
"They are believed to be American,
one thought to be critically wounded.
Police are combing
hospitals and doctors' offices...
...hoping to find the perpetrators
of this shocking crime."
Wouldn't have been a shocking crime
if they'd just dropped the bags.
Okay, you got a bag.
Out of nowhere comes a gun.
What do you do? Drop the bag.
I pick it up, I'm gone.
How hard is that?
Goddamn.
Willis?
You have to promise me
this was the last bank robbery.
Damn right it was the last bank robbery.
Because from now on,
it's the oil business, and that's it.
You're crazy.
Why don't you tell me
about this oil well?
- This oil well?
- Yeah.
- It's out in west Texas.
- Yeah?
- I even got a name for it.
- What is it?
I'll give you one guess.
MAN: The big outfits been using them
high-dollar rotary rigs.
WILLIS: I don't care.
I put everything I got into this here rig.
Where's my oil?
Hell, Mr. Wilson, they done stuck
too many straws in this soda.
There ain't no pressure left.
Let me see if I got this straight.
I put your ass in charge. I've been
paying you top dollar for over a year.
Today, you tell me I got
a chickenshit rig, I'm getting outdrilled.
You got nothing to show for it
but a dry hole?
No, there was oil down there.
They got it all!
Ain't a damn thing I can do about it.
Let me just put it to you simple.
Just like an old sow's belly:
six tits, seven pigs.
Looks like you're number seven.
Well, so who do we go after?
Every one of them
carpetbagging sons of bitches.
Go ahead! That's Standard Oil over there.
John D. Rockefeller from New York City.
Right there is Gulf Oil, Mr. Mellon.
He's a northerner too.
Go on, get him while you're at it.
Big city boys with deep pockets.
Hell, boy, you ain't gonna get enough oil
out of that hole to part your hair.
That goes for all of you.
Every one of you lazy sons of bitches
is fired! Come on, Joe.
JOE:
Willis, I wish you'd have let me do that.
What the hell you looking at,
Betty Crocker peckerhead?
- You know where Jess run off to?
- I got a good idea.
- Why?
- Let's go get him.
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's Booger Red's Wild West show.
It's entertainment for the entire family,
an education for the children.
You'll see the star-spangled pig.
- First place.
JOE: He can't read.
First place. Three times this week.
Looks good, big snakes, but we got
a real job for you. Are you ready to go?
I got a job doing what I like.
What, this? This ain't real, Jess.
It's a damn zoo.
It is real. It is real fun.
Oh.
JOE:
We're broke, Jess.
Yeah.
What are we gonna do?
We're gonna rob something.
Yeah, all right.
That well was a duster.
- Oh, well, that explains it.
DOCK: Come on.
You run out of money
and you need me, Willis?
Look at the big oil man go.
Get off me.
What you doing with my bag?
JESS:
So you boys lost all your money?
Well, at least I know where mine went.
There's something I want to ask you.
Well, you never ask us anything, Willis.
- Just tell us what you decided.
- Now, settle down.
All right.
WILLIS:
All right, it's this.
Banks are pretty much over for us.
They've all gone to cannonball safes.
There's hardly any victory bonds left.
Folks are putting their money
in the stock market.
Or oil wells.
What are we gonna do?
I got something in Chicago...
...and, boys...
...this is the big one.
I still got to check it out closer,
but I got fellows on the inside.
- I don't know, Willis.
- Yeah. Hell, Chicago?
- What's wrong with Chicago?
- I don't know.
Since when have you been gun-shy
about traveling, Jess?
- I don't like the White Sox.
- Yeah.
I'm talking about
getting out of this game.
- We are out of the game.
- I'm talking about a couple of million.
A couple of million dollars?
Now, that's interesting.
- That's a lot of money.
- A lot.
Yeah. I'm talking about our children and
grandchildren not growing up on dirt.
- We won't have no kids if we get killed.
- Ain't nobody gonna get killed.
So banks are over for us.
So what?
We're getting desperate.
That's when it gets dangerous.
You know that, Willis.
This ain't gonna be no Toronto, Joe.
I promise you that.
DOCK: I only got one question.
- What's that?
Boys, do you know the money's there?
JESS: Aw, Joe.
DOCK: Joe!
I can't believe you lied to me again!
That's before I got swindled
out of my oil and lost $ 100,000.
Besides, I said, no more banks.
This is a train. It's safer.
Oh, God!
- I can't quit while we're busted.
- You promised you were finished.
I wanted to be. I lost almost everything
we had trying to be legitimate.
God don't want me to be legal.
I've tried and tried my whole life.
I keep getting pulled back in.
- We still have more money than most.
- You know we ain't most people.
- Besides, I owe the boys.
- They don't want the money. You do.
Yeah, but I've got to take care
of everyone.
Forget everyone else. Think of yourself.
What's wrong with you? You think
you're the only man who got a raw deal?
No, but I'm the one
who's not gonna take it lying down.
You see? You'll never get out of this.
Go get your million, but someday
you are gonna be alone...
...starting in about 10 seconds.
Stop. Stop it. Get out of the car.
Get out of the car.
We're going to Mother's.
Don't bother us.
- I want to stay.
- See? See?
- What do you want?
- Name's Willie Rice. Friend of Murray's.
Come on in.
MURRAY: Willie.
WILLIS: Murray.
Any trouble finding the place?
- None at all.
- Good. Come on.
Wait till you hear about this setup. It's the
sweetest deal I've ever stumbled over.
I grew up with him. Bill Fahy's the name.
Punk kid out back of the stockyards.
Puny little bastard.
Saved him more than once.
Anyway, he goes legit and becomes
a postal inspector, of all things.
Two months ago, they transfer him
from D.C. Back to his old neighborhood.
He likes the girls and he likes the ponies.
Now, with the girls, you pay them
enough, they always finish in the money.
But the ponies...
He's in deep, more than
a postal inspector makes in a lifetime.
- Anyway, he comes to me, and he says...
WILLIS: Jimmy, I get the picture.
Let me introduce you.
I want you to meet somebody.
Don't tell me your name.
It doesn't matter.
You're a friend of his or he wouldn't even
buy the first round, chiseling bastard.
Nice girls, huh?
Hey. It's the man I was telling you
about, the one that's gonna help us out.
Details, details.
Hey, buddy.
Details is my middle name, all right?
That's why I want to know everything
there is to know about this mail train.
I supply the guys, gas,
guns and the guts.
You boys can sit back and split even.
Can you handle that?
Yes, sir.
Good.
The consignments come down
every Thursday on the 57 train.
The Milwaukee registers are the pay dirt.
Last week, it was 63 bags
insured for 3 million.
And sometimes, the Federal Reserve
loads extra bags at the last minute.
I'm gonna check all this out,
then do some planning on this train.
Afterwards, any laundry work needs
doing, you take it at 5 percent, Murray.
Ten.
Seven and a half.
Done.
GLASSCOCK:
Gonna be dark out there tonight.
So I think it's a good idea
if we wear these light hats...
...so we can identify one another.
How do we know
we're not being set up?
Shit, Joe. Wait.
We're from Texas, and these fellows
must know plenty of thieves in Chicago.
- Yep, and the thieves know them.
- Chicago's run by the mob.
Irish, Italian, whatever.
Someone makes a score,
they got to fork a big chunk over.
Country boys like us ride in, do the job,
we're gone.
They get no tax from the big boys.
JOE: Mail train's a federal offense,
Willis. Federal.
- Breaking the law's breaking the law.
- This ain't a little robbery.
No, we sure as hell ain't talking
no little robbery.
And when the heat's on,
we got our friend on the inside.
I just got one question.
Yeah, the money's there.
Three million dollars' worth.
I just seen it
through a little peephole downtown.
Goddamn it, this is everything
we've been working towards.
We got a job to do,
and if we do it right, it's the last one.
It's too much money.
How do we get away with that?
It's like killing someone.
They ain't gonna let it go.
- We'll be in Mexico.
- You ain't up for it today?
- It's just...
- Here's your chance. You want out?
That ain't it and you know it.
I'm in.
I'm just asking, are you sure?
All right.
Boys...
...we're fixing to make history.
All right. Get off, boys.
This here is my train.
Scram, boys. The bulls!
Thought we was the law.
How about that?
JOE:
JESS: Hands up or I blow your head off!
- Get them up. Keep them up.
We're stopping this train at the crossing.
Mister, don't make me blow
your guts out, because I will. Do it.
- Get your mitts on that throttle.
FIREMAN: Do what he says, Steve.
What's wrong with you?
You been kicked in the head?
Hold on.
It's going too far.
Damn.
Goddamn it. Now, look at where we are.
Back it up to where I said. Now.
- It'll take a minute.
- Better take a quick minute.
Ain't this a hell of a way
to make a living?
Everybody in there, come on out.
What in the hell is going on?
Keep them hands up.
We're robbing this train.
I was wondering if we'd hit something.
- Anybody in there?
BRAKEMAN: No, just me.
All them postal turkeys is up front.
I'll see what the hell's going on
up there.
Get down.
We're going up to the crossing.
GLASSCOCK: Where is everybody?
SLIM: I don't know.
Something ain't right.
That big son of a bitch
must have run off.
What the hell's going on
with this train?
God.
Hey.
Hey, drop that goddamn gun!
WILLIS:... at the crossing.
We're parked on it...
...you stupid rat bastard.
Coming down with two!
Coming up with one.
Slowly.
SLIM: Remember, they got guns in there.
- Yeah, well, so do we.
JESS: I got him. I got him, Joe.
WILLIS: Got him?
Mail car 2105.
Everybody outside now.
Let's go!
Watch the window.
Don't shoot. We're out here too.
WILLIS:
Jackson, get that poison gas.
All right, you silly bastards.
You're about to wish to God
you had come out.
Don't let him kill them in there.
Oh, it's all right.
Nobody ever died from a stink bomb.
Drop them guns, now!
Come on.
JESS: Get over there.
WILLIS: Hurry up. Let's go. Let's go!
JOE: You, drop it.
WILLIS: Who's the head honcho here?
All right, move it, y'all. In here.
Come on, now.
I'm only after the registered mail,
and I want every sack of it.
- You understand me?
- Yes, sir.
Good. Let's go.
Talk to me.
Uh, Milwaukee registers are all up here.
St. Paul goes back this way,
and this section's going to Minneapolis.
There it is.
All right. Start helping me toss
these out, and get Milwaukee first.
- Every single bit of it, honcho. Let's go.
CLERK: Yes, sir.
JESS: Coming down.
Where the hell have you been?
Oh, Jesus! Some Hoosier tried
to sneak off the other side.
Had a shotgun. Goddamn it.
I had to shoot the son of a bitch.
Y'all got anybody over there
on the other side?
You've got us all here, mister.
JESS: Oh, hell. Joe, you got all them.
JOE: All right.
GLASSCOCK: I got him.
Hell, I shot him five times, Jess.
No, no, no.
He's further down the line.
Every one of you will pick up a bag
and lug it to them two cars.
- Get going.
GLASSCOCK: Let's go.
JOE: That too.
GLASSCOCK: Throw it down here.
Put them in the back seat of that car.
Some of you come here
and start loading in the back of this car.
Oh, my God.
You idiot!
You shot Dock!
No, no, I didn't.
That's a Hoosier, Jess.
Oh, Jesus.
You shot my brother.
Goddamn it, Willis! Willis!
Get over here. It's Dock!
- Jackson?
- Yeah. Go.
I think we can take this guy.
Yeah, you might all could take me,
but two or three of you will die doing it.
Now, get back to work.
Easy, Dock. Dock, come on.
Oh, shit.
WILLIS:
No, no. Shit.
- Goddamn it.
JESS: He's bleeding to death.
Oh, shit.
We got to get him to the doctor.
You hold it.
We're gonna get you out of here, Hoss.
Damn it. You just hang in there.
You hold on, Hoss.
Come on, Dock. Come on, now.
Come on.
Did you get it?
JOE:
Come on.
Easy. Come on, come on.
Get that on there.
Get the hell out of here.
Now!
- I don't think he'll make it.
- Yes, he is. Get us a doctor.
- Out here? Forget it.
- Then we'll bring him to Chicago.
They'll tear the town apart.
A doctor sees him, calls the cops.
Let's keep our heads.
This could blow the deal.
- We'll split the money and cut our losses.
- Job ain't done till Dock's taken care of.
- Bad idea.
- Take it easy.
Murray, you know people.
That's why you're in this deal.
I don't give a goddamn how,
but find someplace and someone.
If you don't, I swear,
you're not gonna make it.
Calm down, Willis. Calm down.
I know a guy.
Let's go then, goddamn it.
Joe, take Dock with Murray and Slim.
We'll stash the money.
- Eight shares, eight different places.
SLIM: Trust you with our shares?
We're trusting you with our brother.
Damn!
SLIM:
Jesus, Murray, I don't like this.
Somebody had to see us
drag this bloody son of a bitch up here.
Why isn't he dead, doc?
DOCTOR: I don't know. Chest wound
alone should have killed him.
Went in between his heart and his lungs.
I'II, uh, I'll be back tomorrow
to work on the fractures in his arms.
Keep quiet and don't get seen.
He wants to win a fiddling contest,
that's his problem.
It'd be a good idea
if we got the hell out of here too.
Joe? Get.
Hey.
We ain't leaving you, Dock.
When you wake up,
I'll be sitting right here.
Don't pass nothing till you get to Texas.
Remember, no contact for a year.
He didn't have a hat on, Willis.
God almighty.
Joe.
SERGEANT:
Visiting hours is over, pal.
Fan him.
A pin. Just like the kid.
It's got an anchor on it.
What's this about?
- What are you doing up here?
- They told me I could buy beer up here.
Come a long way for a drink, Tex.
- You got a name, candy boy?
- Yeah, I got a name. Name's Will Reed.
I'm an oil man, goddamn it.
I'm throwing a party. I came here...
Party's all over, pal.
We got your buddies two hours ago.
That was an awful big score
you guys made last night.
It's too bad half the world saw
you guys coming here.
I'm just a messenger boy
in this scheme, all right?
You two seem like good old boys.
We can work something out.
Is that so?
I ain't got none of that money...
...but I can get my hands on
a nice chunk of it, if you're interested.
They say the value
of money is all relative.
This, for instance, is only 10 smackers.
It's nothing compared
to the millions you crooks pinched.
But...
...it can pack a pretty hefty wallop.
Time's relative.
You're what, 22, 23?
You'll be 50 years old
before you get out of prison...
...if I don't get some answers.
We got plenty of time.
Because.
I need you, Lou.
Come on.
You can tell me, can't you?
I know this hurts.
I hope I die first.
Chief Schoemaker?
There's a message for you.
- They say it's urgent.
- Thanks. We'll talk later.
Time is running out, pal.
Looks like you've been jobbed.
- She'll be here.
- She?
Yep. She's a business associate.
She doesn't know what this is about.
She's just bringing the money.
Ain't a skirt in the world I'd trust
with 20 G's.
I'd be worrying
about every time I let her down...
...every time she caught me
hanging a story on her...
Women never really forgive you
for that stuff.
DETECTIVE: We've waited a half-hour.
She ain't gonna show.
There she is.
I've got the money.
- Yeah. You saw the papers?
- Yeah.
We're just business associates.
You don't know nothing.
- Okay.
- I'm getting out of this.
When the time's right,
we'll bust Joe and Dock out.
All right?
Hey, Lou.
This one's pretty.
You say you two
are just business associates?
Back off, flatfoot.
- It's all here. Let him go.
- Yeah. Get lost.
Nice doing business
with you, candy boy.
Let's have it.
You're in a lot of trouble.
You're coming with me.
- Take her down to the precinct house.
- Yes, sir.
WILLIS: Goddamn it.
Backstabbing Yankee bastards!
Couldn't you have counted it
a little faster?
SCHOEMAKER:
So you're the smart one, right?
I take a bird like you downtown,
you get a lawyer, you post bail.
I never see you again.
No, my friend. I'm taking you to
Rockford, where my cousin's the sheriff.
He's got a nice little solitary box
up on the third floor.
I think you'll like it.
Unless, of course, you want to tell me
where that post office loot is hidden.
So you can go tell the Feds about it?
Most of it.
Sorry, chief, but I ain't talking,
unless it's to the man in charge...
...and you ain't him.
ALDRICH:
Biggest one ever.
Makes quite a splash, this kind of thing.
Well, nobody got hurt but one
of their own. But all them zeros...
Yeah, the public's gonna want
to see blood on this one.
What we got to do here
is put our heads together...
...and try to figure out
who the inside man was.
I'm sorry. Inside?
They knew every consignment
on that train.
Somebody pretty high up on the inside
must have tipped them.
And I'll bet you my paycheck...
...it was someone
right in your department.
Huh.
Hmm.
Okay.
Thanks for coming, Lou.
I would've come sooner,
but they wouldn't let me.
WILLIS:
I know.
Schoemaker give you the list
of bad things that'll happen to me...
...if I don't tell him what he wants?
He said you could go in for life, Willis.
Could. I mean,
if I don't play my cards right.
They said you were in solitary.
Yeah.
How can you bear it?
I just sit there thinking.
About you, mostly.
I swear, it's like
you're there with me, Lou.
I can look into your eyes.
I hear your voice.
I even smell your hair.
I just think about being
in the same room with you, Lou.
Not talking or nothing.
Just knowing you're there.
You have got quite a line, Mr. Newton.
I suppose I do.
Lou.
You know all them things
I used to tell you I wanted?
All I want now is to be with you.
I hope this doesn't take too long.
I told my wife I'd try
to make it home for dinner.
No, no, it won't take but a minute.
In fact, it's right in here.
Well, go ahead. Take a peek.
Son of a gun.
That's strange, isn't it?
A peephole looking into the sorting room.
FAHY:
Son of a gun.
Anybody could have made this.
Oh...
Anybody exactly... your height.
MAN:
Yeah! Come on, now.
What did I tell you?
I ain't never been throwed.
Perfect record.
You owe me 50 Yankee dollars.
Hell of a ride, son. You win.
It wasn't as mean as you said.
I come all the way from Mexico for that?
Not just that, Jess.
I'm Frank Hamer, Texas Rangers.
Folks up in Chicago would like
to have a little word with you.
Aw, hell.
Frank Hamer.
Well, Frank, how about you let me go,
I'll let you keep that 50?
I guess not.
You guess not.
Howdy.
SCHOEMAKER:
Take a good look.
GLASSCOCK: That light's bugging me.
SCHOEMAKER: Look familiar?
- Yeah, I know them.
SCHOEMAKER: Identify them.
Well, let's see.
This is Rube Waddell.
That's Tris Speaker,
Rogers Hornsby...
- Isn't that Ty Cobb?
- Yeah, that's Ty Cobb.
SCHOEMAKER:
You know this bird?
Well, looks like he was weaned
on a pickle, don't it?
SCHOEMAKER:
Shut up.
Do you know him?
No, I don't,
and I wouldn't care to, neither.
You know, Jess, your brothers
have spilled the whole deal.
Well, great.
Then you don't need me, do you?
Sit down.
Look, chief, you are doing a hell of a job
on this case.
Congratulations on pulling us in...
...but you could squeeze us
from now until Judgment Day...
...and you won't get
word number one out of us.
Get out of here.
We got you, we got your brothers...
...we got Murray, we got Slim.
We even tracked down
your old pal Glasscock...
...at a health spa in Battle Creek.
Still can't help you, sir.
I'm getting sick and tired
of you stupid, closed-mouthed country...
Go easy on that stuff, chief.
You're either the smartest or dumbest
son of a bitch I ever dealt with.
We've tried it your way for three months
and haven't found a nickel.
Let's try it mine.
- Hey, Willis. K.P. Aldrich.
WILLIS: Howdy.
Feel like I know you already.
- You met Chief Schoemaker.
- Oh, yeah.
Well, sit, sit.
So are you from the federal government?
ALDRICH:
That's right.
It's about time.
- Uvalde, right?
- Yep.
ALDRICH: I'm from Austin myself.
- That's pretty country.
That it is.
Look, Willis,
I'm gonna put it to you square.
We got to figure some way out of this.
Yeah.
I figure since it's Joe's first offense...
Willis, I got a file
as thick as your arm there...
...on jobs you fellows pulled
all across the country.
I've been following you boys
for a while now.
I got to hand it to you, Willis.
You sure as hell had yourself
one hell of a gang.
But I'm sure some people
in the Justice Department...
...might be interested
in digging up some old business.
- Lf I deal, do we walk?
- No, not right away.
Not on this one.
But I could be very, very influential...
...with the judge
who will do the sentencing.
WILLIS:
Give me details.
You and Dock won't get more than 12.
Should be out in four.
Murray and Slim...
No, them bastards got their own money.
They can make their own deal.
What about Joe?
If Joe and Jess
make a good impression in court...
No, no. See, now,
Jess had nothing to do with this.
He was off running horses...
We got Jess when he came across
the border to ride a pony on a bet.
So don't bullshit me, son.
I'm being straight with you here.
All right.
How much?
They could get off with a year...
...but for that, I need
all the money back...
...and I need you to hand me
that little weasel Bill Fahy.
Hmm.
You know us Newtons do a lot of things,
but there are a few things we don't do.
We don't kill nobody, we don't steal
from women and children...
...and we don't rat.
Somebody's got to, Willis,
or we don't have a deal.
- May I approach the witness, Your Honor?
JUDGE: You may.
Could you identify, for the jurors...
...the person in this courtroom...
...who actually
masterminded the robbery?
It's the gentleman sitting there
in the brown suit, William Fahy.
He's a liar.
I've never seen this guy in my life!
I'm being railroaded.
It's not me.
It's them. It's Willis Newton.
He planned the whole thing
with his brothers.
Order in the court.
Sit down, Mr. Fahy, or I'll have you
removed from this courtroom.
The Newtons will be dealt with.
But since this is your trial...
...I suggest you concern yourself
with the business at hand.
Willis.
I think this is gonna work.
Well, when it does, you're gonna be
talking to an ex-millionaire.
JUDGE: Do you understand the meaning
of a guilty plea, Mr. Newton?
Uh, yes, sir, Your Honor.
It means we're guilty.
You caught us with the wet finger
in the sugar sack, sir.
We're guilty, and we're awful sorry
we put everybody through this trouble.
See, we're simple cowboys...
...and we don't know much about guns
and, you know, train robbing.
It just sort of come along on a lark,
if you know what I mean.
Is it true you turned to the fireman
and said:
"Ain't this a hell of a way
to make a living?"
I guess, I guess.
But a fellow has to ask himself
what's right and what's wrong.
And what we did was wrong.
I suppose we messed up
that train robbery...
...about as much as any outfit could.
Even managed to shoot our own brother.
No...
Your Honor,
I figure that the Newton Boys...
...was never cut out
for the wrong side of the law.
- You may sit down, Mr. Newton.
- Thank you, Your Honor.
JUDGE:
Counselor, approach the bench.
- Hell of a performance, Jess.
- Folks seemed to appreciate it.
Yeah, damn right.
Tell you what, it's a good thing
we still got that 35,000.
Actually, we don't have that 35,000.
- Did you spend it?
- No, I didn't spend it. I buried it.
I went out one night with this cab driver.
He was a great guy.
We found a perfect spot,
we covered it up...
...and I come back
a couple of days later.
It's daylight, and the whole damn place
looks exactly the same.
I can't tell one rock from another.
Then what you're saying...
...is you got drunk
and you lost that money.
I probably had a couple,
but that wasn't it.
The trouble was, this cab driver
was on a serious drunk.
He didn't even know what road
we was on. He was no help at all.
Goddamn it, Willis, I'd been looking
for that money every day...
...until they come and drag my ass
up here.
JUDGE:
Would the defendants please rise?
Oh, I guess you're right, brother Jess.
Us Newtons ain't cut out
for the wrong side of the law.
MAN:
Here they come, here they come!
Back up.
CARSON: My first guest is a gentleman
who was one of the Newton Brothers.
Would you welcome Joe Newton.
Joe?
- How are you, sir?
- Fine.
- It's nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
I think people thought I was really joking
and this was kind of a put-on.
- That we were gonna have...
- Nothing put-on about this.
- This was in 1924?
- 1924.
That you robbed a train.
What train was that?
Now, I wasn't around in 1924.
It's Rondout of Chicago,
out of Rondout, Illinois.
- About 30 miles out of Chicago.
CARSON: Right.
It was a little station called Rondout.
That's where they got the name,
and it was a mail train, going west.
CARSON: Right. Now, it says you...
In four years, you robbed 80 banks.
Well, we robbed a lot of them.
No, we didn't rob
all the banks in Texas.
We robbed 30, 40,
but we robbed plenty in other states...
...like Illinois, Arkansas, Missouri...
...Kansas, Wisconsin,
North and South Dakota...
...and several other states.
We were just like doctors,
lawyers and everybody else.
It was our business to do that.
We never killed anybody
and we never wanted to.
All we wanted was the money,
to make money.
CARSON: You lived pretty well,
I suppose, when you were...
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, we stayed at the best hotels...
...drove the best cars there was
in them days.
CARSON: Yeah. A lot of women?
- Well, there's always...
If you got a good car, a pocketful
of money, and you're a young man...
That'll help you quick with that.
Nobody never give me anything
but hell in my life...
...and I never done anything
I been ashamed of doing, either.
I've done some things I was sorry of.
One thing I was sorry of,
we robbed a bank up in Kansas.
An old boy inside got scared
and wouldn't open up $200,000.
All he had to do
was put it in the handbag.
When I bawled him out,
we said, "We got enough."
I said, "We never get enough."
I said, "When I go in to get anything,
I want it all."
From then on, I went inside.
They was cleaned out when I come out.
When did they catch you?
Right after the 1924...
One of our men. It wasn't one of us.
It was one of the men
that was working with us.
He got excited, and he...
It had to be excitement.
He went up and across on the other side
where he wasn't supposed to be...
...and shot my brother,
one of my brothers.
CARSON: Killed him?
- No, no.
He shot him five or six times with a.45.
It should have killed him.
- A.45 is a big-bore weapon.
JOE: Yeah.
That should have pretty well...
Your brother recovered?
Yeah, recovered
and lived to be 83 years old.
CARSON:
Yeah?
My mother was over in Cottonwood
one day, and she met my schoolteacher.
I had quit,
and she asked her why.
My mother said, "His clothes
got so bad, he was ashamed to go."
She said,
"He's the smartest pupil I ever had.
If you send him for an education, there's
no telling what he'll make of himself.
If he don't get his education,
there's no telling what he'll do."
CARSON: How old were you
when you started this?
Nineteen years old.
Nineteen years old.
When was the first time
you went to jail?
Uh, that Rondout train robbery.
CARSON: Yeah?
- Yeah.
I thought you were gonna put that on
and stick me up.
You thought I was gonna...
You thought l...
I thought you were.
I thought you were putting your
mask on and were gonna sort of...
Old habits die hard, don't they, Joe?
Let me ask you.
Looking back, if you had to do it over,
you wouldn't recommend...
No! We was crazy for doing it. I look
back and see then. But you're young then.
Then somebody said, "Why didn't you
invest that money into something?"
I said, "Who wants a better job
than what we already got?"
That's what we thought then.
Need money, go rob another bank.
- But you wouldn't recommend that...
- No, I wouldn't. That'd be crazy. Yeah.
When I first thought of robbing banks,
I never thought of hurting anybody.
I knew all of them bankers was rich,
and they didn't care about hurting...
They didn't care
about hurting us poor farmers.
So why should I care
about hurting them?
Why shouldn't I steal from them?
It's just one thief stealing from another.
