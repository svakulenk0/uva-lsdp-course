Leave it go, the strongbox.
- lf this is a holdup, why...
- Shut up!
- We haven't...
- Shut up, you too, boy!
Why we go so slow?
- Welcome to Arizona, Adam.
- John.
Meet my foreman Hermando.
Herman for short.
This crazy brigand used to
raid me so much in the old days...
...I had to hire him.
But he's been honest ever since.
I sure scare you out of the daylights,
eh, Mr. Stewart?
You did. It was a well-played joke.
- I don't think it's so funny.
- You must be Howie.
- You look like a Stewart.
- Yeah?
- Glad to meet you, Uncle John.
- Last time I saw you...
...you were a year old.
We'll have to get reacquainted.
Folks, this is the biggest day
in my life.
The guest of honour
is my brother Adam from Ohio.
He's a fine lawyer, and now
that he's going to be one of us...
...we'll finally have
some law in Ocatilla.
- Glad to have you settle here.
- Thank you.
John's been talking about you
for months.
- Glad to be here.
- This is Sheriff and Mrs. Gibbons.
They were married only last week.
- This is my son, Howie.
- How do you do?
- Hello.
- Howie.
You'll get to know everybody
soon enough.
Oh, Bill. Roll that coach out of here.
Hey, get those fiddles
and guitars going.
Come on, dance up, everybody.
We're going to have a gala.
Put it on that table over there.
Hurry up now.
I've been saving Corinne
for the last.
Adam, Howie, this is Mrs. Michaels,
my best girl.
He just calls me that.
I'm not really.
- How do you do?
- Yes, you are too.
Organize a party for me,
beginning to end.
A party needs a woman's touch,
and at a time like this...
...I always chase into town
for her help.
I can't imagine where
you could do better, John.
Thank you, Mr. Stewart.
Howie, how do you think
you're going to like living in Arizona?
Well, I don't know.
I liked it all right in Cincinnati.
Oh, Wick, I want you to meet
my brother Adam.
- Wick Campbell.
- How do you do?
- My nephew Howie.
- Howie.
Adam, Campbell is almost
as big in the town of Ocatilla...
...or so he thinks,
as I am in the valleys.
He'll probably throw you
a lot of business.
You can be sure of that. But I'm
small potatoes compared to John.
He runs everything
for 100 miles around Ocatilla.
I don't run anything, Wick.
But I like to help a man
build on his own, as I did you.
I haven't forgotten it, Stewart.
- He won't let me.
- That's right.
Howie, you and Maria
should be dancing.
Go on. Wick won't mind.
He can't dance. He's all mule feet.
May I?
Would you mind sitting this one out?
I'd like to talk to you.
Please?
Excuse us, Corinne?
I'd like a minute with Adam.
Naturally, after 18 years.
Come along. I want to
show you something.
I thought maybe we could
get better acquainted here.
- Do you live in Ocatilla?
- Yes.
Well, that's great. I'll be living there,
too, with my father.
I'll have a lot of free time on my hands.
Maybe we can spend it together.
Can I get you anything,
Mr. Campbell?
I can find what I want.
John's oldest friends,
late for his party.
We had to stay behind to see
that the holdup went off all right.
Well, it looks as though John
has got everything...
...he ever hoped for.
- Yeah.
Where in town do you live?
It doesn't matter.
- What are you so nervous about?
- Nothing. Why?
What's your hookup with Campbell?
Are you his steady girl or something?
Oh, no. No, I am not his girl.
Well, I shouldn't think so.
He's old enough to be your father.
Please, we dance. Yes?
All right.
Did you ever see a sight like that?
You never get tired looking at it.
In the beginning,
the Apaches came...
...and burned me to the ground
four times, but they couldn't kill me.
Bandits swept across
the Rio Grande...
...stole my cattle and horses time
and again. I killed three of them.
But I branded more cattle,
all I could find.
Mavericks that were running wild
because there was no market for cattle.
Then the markets opened, and I drove
thousands of longhorns to Abilene...
...Wichita and Dodge as the price
went from a dollar a head to 30.
And that did it.
Look, Adam, from the Bask Grande
to the Bonita River.
As far as you can see,
everything is mine.
- I'm proud of you, John.
- And I'm proud of myself.
All the years of fighting are behind.
When settlers came
to this valley...
...there was only the adobe village
of Ocatilla...
...which the Mexicans and the Indians
had started to build.
We finished it for them. And now
we've got the start of a real town.
And as the first attorney,
you'll mean law and peace.
And you'll make them strong,
and you'll make them last.
You place great faith in me, John,
but I'll do my best.
Sure.
You're a Stewart, aren't you?
I don't like strangers
dancing with Maria.
If she wants to dance,
that's her business.
- It's my business.
- Oh, Wick, please.
Flirting with him
because he's a Stewart.
- Now, listen, mister.
- You keep away from her at all times.
- You understand?
- Campbell!
I invite a man to my house,
he acts like a gentleman.
- He was pawing her.
- I was not. I didn't do anything.
I'm sure you weren't, Howie.
Keep on playing.
Go on dancing, folks.
I'm getting tired of you
telling me what to do.
Get out of here
till you sober up.
- We're going.
- Maria, you are always welcome...
...just the same as your father was.
- Come on.
- I'd like to...
- Let's have some refreshments.
Maria!
Keep away from me.
- You're acting like a little fool.
- Why do you act the way you do?
All because I would have fun
dancing with that Stewart boy.
No other man dances with you.
Most of all a Stewart.
Your jealousy is like a craziness.
Maria, when your father
was killed in my saloon...
...you were homeless.
I felt sorry for you.
I wanted to make it up to you.
- I gave you everything. All this.
- I did not know how it would be.
I did not think that
you would fall in love with me.
Or what you call love.
I do love you.
You've grown into
a beautiful young woman...
...and no man's going to
have you but me.
So you'll take and own me...
...like you do everything else...
...no matter how I feel.
That's right.
When I close that saloon tonight,
I'm coming back here.
And you'll be waiting.
- Better give me another one of those.
- Why all the champagne?
What is this,
your wedding night?
Wedding night.
Yeah, that's what I am,
a blushing bridegroom.
Maria.
Maria!
Maria!
- Maria!
- What's wrong?
- Where is she?
- Miss Segura?
- She left a couple hours ago.
- Where'd she go?
I don't know, but she said
she wouldn't come back ever.
I know where she went.
Herman, I want you to take Howie
with you today...
...when you check that south range.
- Whatever you say, boss.
- Pretty early for you, ain't it?
- Maria rode out here last night.
I've come to take her back.
She's here to stay.
She wants no part of you.
She's the only thing
that matters to me.
She's all I think about.
You wouldn't understand that.
Lately, I don't understand
much of anything about you.
You could talk to her.
Tell her I'll be good to her.
No. The girl's afraid of you.
It's as simple as that.
- You have no right to interfere!
- Right? She needed help.
You know, Campbell,
you're not thinking straight.
Since you've become a big man,
you have the idea that everything...
...should be done the way you want it,
and that's dangerous.
Better straighten yourself out
before somebody does it for you.
- You, Stewart?
- Possibly.
For days those hard cases
have been drifting in...
...from the tough towns in the West.
- I know, Dad. I wish I knew why.
Well, I know one thing,
they're professional gun hawks...
...every last one of them.
Your father's right, sheriff,
they are gun hawks.
Why don't you run them
out of town?
You can't go chasing strangers
just because they look ornery.
They gotta break the law first.
I don't like it.
There's gonna be trouble.
Marva's fixing some stew, Dad.
It's your favourite.
- Coming to supper?
- No. No, thanks, son.
I'll leave you two newlyweds alone.
Scavo. Welcome to Ocatilla.
Hello, Campbell.
Well, time hasn't changed you much.
Greedy-looking as ever.
Picked up the Colton Brothers here
on their way out of Kansas...
...moving fast.
- Glad to know you.
Al Drucker, Dave Weed
and some of the others you know...
...are already inside. Come on in.
Scavo, you know Drucker, Weed.
- Give these boys anything they want.
- Mr. Campbell, you ought to know...
...these fellas got no bottoms
to their stomachs.
- They'll eat and drink you dry.
- Did I ask you? Set them up.
We want to know when this ball
we've been invited to is gonna open.
Stewart's already opened it.
And I'm gonna close it,
with your help.
And I'm gonna start right now.
Well, Grinnel,
I've been expecting you.
I know.
And don't think I don't know...
...why you want my ranch in particular,
Campbell, because I do.
Why is that, Tod?
Well...
...it's because my ranch...
...butts right up against
Stewart's land.
Now, if you got a foothold
on the range...
...you'd be figuring out some scheme
to whittle John down to your level.
- Of course you're wrong about that.
- Am I?
Everybody knows you hate him
from here to breakfast...
...for keeping that Mexican girl
out of your reach.
Tod, I thought you were here
to talk about that loan on your ranch.
It's due today.
You wouldn't be thinking of giving me
an extension, would you?
- Can't afford it.
- No. That's what I was afeard of.
Your only reason for loaning me
that money in the beginning...
...was because you were sure
I'd never be able to repay it.
Well, I've got a surprise for you.
I'm going to pay that loan in full.
In cash.
So you can fork out that note
and mark it...
...cancelled.
The money will be here
on the noon stage.
Tod, I'm real glad to hear it.
I hate to see a hardship
worked on any man.
Red, go across the street
and get that lawyer Adam Stewart.
We'll settle this all legally
and right now. Go ahead.
And I'll buy you a drink to celebrate.
Well, that's real nice of you, Wick.
- What'll you have?
- Bourbon.
Two bourbons.
It seems a shame to take half
your office from you, Mrs. Michaels.
There's just no other place in this town
for an office, as John told you.
Besides, there's plenty of room.
You're very kind.
Of course,
I don't have any clients as yet.
You will. Your brother's
been drumming up...
...business for you for weeks.
How long have you known John?
Almost 10 years.
About the time my husband died.
We'd just moved here
and built this house.
I decided to stay...
...so John asked Mr. Carr
to give me a job in the freighter office.
What's this I hear about
you being his best girl?
That's just his way
of joking with me.
Well, if he had any sense,
he shouldn't joke about it.
I can see you don't know John.
Building his ranch, raising cattle,
helping this town to prosper...
...hasn't left him very much time
for the ladies.
- He's been much too busy.
- Yes.
- He told me so.
- Mr. Stewart.
Mr. Campbell would like to see you.
He has some lawyer business.
You see? A client already.
- Would you mind?
- Yes.
- Sheriff, I'm glad you're here too.
- What's the story?
Tod Grinnel came in here
begging for an extension on a loan...
...I hold on his ranch. I refused him.
He went crazy
and drew down on me.
Guess you heard the first shot.
That was his.
I had to kill him in self-defence.
- That right?
- Just like he said. We all saw it.
Mr. Stewart,
this is my first job for you.
You'll have to foreclose this mortgage
I hold on Tod Grinnel's ranch.
I thought Grinnel was your friend.
That's what makes it so sad.
I've known Tod for years.
First time I was ever forced
to kill a man...
...and it had to be a friend of mine.
Have some hot coffee
before you turn in.
No.
I shot some breakfast for us.
I'm sick of those Mexican flapjacks.
What's the matter
with the Mexican flaps?
You don't like too much
this ranch work, do you, Howie?
- You can have it.
- And how happen you took the job?
It was Uncle John's idea.
Said it'd be good for me.
You know, boy...
...the fever get
in your blood someday...
...like it did your uncle.
You can have him too.
Give me a cup of coffee.
Stewart's running too many cattle
for his range.
Maybe we should ship
some of them for him.
It's a good idea. Saves grass.
Go ahead.
It's Red Dawes, one of Wick
Campbell's men. I know him.
Campbell never can do this
to us Stewarts.
Look. They're coming back
to get him. Let's go.
Let them go.
We can't catch them now.
You see.
They take the cattle
to Campbell's ranch.
Yes, that's Campbell's trail herd
on the way to market.
- Any of them yours?
- Can't tell...
...but he's had time to rebrand them.
Campbell never take over
that many cattle from Tod Grinnel.
Come on, we'll follow them
to the loading pens.
There you are, Mr. Campbell.
The tally shows 1217 head.
A big shipment.
Just what my tally shows, Campbell.
Now, what business
is this of yours?
I know the late Tod Grinnel was
running slightly less than 1000 head...
...when you inherited his ranch.
- What of it?
- Happens I lost around 300 head...
...the other night...
...which makes up the difference
for the increase.
And many of the brands...
...they plenty fresh,
huh, Mr. Campbell?
If you'll check carefully,
you'll find that all the brands are fresh.
I'm in the cattle business to stay now,
and I rebranded Tod Grinnel's herd...
...with my own new, registered brand:
the Broken-Bar-O.
And you haven't any case
against me at all.
No?
This is Red Dawes' vest.
One of your hired hands.
- He'll be glad to get it back.
- He won't need it.
He was stampeded to death
rustling my cattle.
So Red turned to that?
I knew he was bad.
That's why I fired him a week ago.
You still haven't any case against me.
- What about it, Adam?
- It's his word against what you believe.
Not much evidence to give before
a court of law, without witnesses.
And you haven't any.
See, this law that protects you
also works for me.
You don't like that. Maybe you were
better off in the old days...
...when you took and kept
what you wanted...
...with a hard fist and a fast gun.
That's the last time you'll ever
throw anything in my face, Stewart.
There's one of them now.
That's John Stewart's nephew.
Good-looking fella, and young.
I can see how that Mexican gal would
like it better at the ranch than with you.
That's no way for you
to be losing your temper.
You're paying us good money
for that sort of thing...
...and now you want to have
all the fun yourself.
Pull a paper, fellas. High wins.
Let me have him, Scavo.
He's just my size.
Kid's yours, Weed. Take him.
Well, you don't have to push.
I don't?
And who are you?
My name's Stewart.
So you're a Stewart...
...from the big ranch in the valley.
Any of them Stewarts I hate.
I get all worked up.
I hate them so much I could kill.
Feel the same way
myself sometimes.
Look, fella, why don't you
have another drink.
Didn't you hear what I said
about the Stewarts?
Yeah, but I don't want to...
To fight you about it.
You're going to.
But I don't have a gun.
Then find one now.
I'll walk outside for a minute...
...then walk back in.
Who does he think he's fooling?
He ain't fooling.
He meant what he said.
He wouldn't.
Not when I don't have a gun.
Take mine, boy.
I don't want it.
I'm not afraid.
I just don't want to fight anybody.
I don't want your gun, fella.
Stewart did it, sheriff.
Killed him with my gun.
What a dirty trick I played
on that poor young punk.
But you can't let me stay here.
I'm innocent.
Every man there swore
that the dead man was only joking...
...when Howie suddenly
grabbed Scavo's gun and shot.
- I had to bring him in.
- They lied. I shot in self-defence.
We know that, Howie.
So does Clyde.
Then why am I in jail?
Why can't I get out on bail?
I'm sorry, Howie,
but bail isn't allowed in a killing.
Your father knows that too.
He's been riding all day
looking for the circuit judge.
- He's long overdue.
- Yeah.
Wait for the circuit judge.
With all those witnesses
calling me a liar.
You'll have a fair trial.
Then you'll be legally free.
Thanks. Thanks for nothing.
Put out your hands.
Now turn around.
- Well, what's all this for?
- Well, I'm taking no chances.
Anything happens to you,
Campbell will break my neck.
Come on.
Sit down.
We'll play some poker.
For chips. I'll collect later.
What are you doing?
I dropped a card.
These irons get in my way.
I'll get it.
What the devil?
I don't want to kill you...
...so do what I say and do it exactly,
or I will.
Now, easy, Howie. Easy.
Get the keys
and take off these irons.
I ain't got them, Howie.
The sheriff's got them on him.
- Don't stall me.
- So help me, Howie...
...now, that's the only set there is.
Now, why don't you settle down.
You can't get away.
And I won't say nothing
about your trying.
Get that ax, and be careful.
Split the chain on my ankles.
And swing straight.
Give me your gun belt.
Inside. Hurry up.
If you're heading to Stewart's
for his nephew...
...don't waste your time.
He ain't there.
- How do you know?
- I've been working there...
...keeping my eyes open,
like you wanted.
I had them open at daybreak
when that kid Howie rode in.
He went to the blacksmith shop,
cut off his handcuffs and leg irons.
I figured he escaped from jail.
Next, he got some grub and stuff,
then left again.
- His uncle help him?
- No, Maria Segura.
He knocked on her window,
talked to her, then rode away.
A minute later, she sneaked out
with a saddlebag and rode after him.
Stewart didn't know a thing about it
until he got up.
- Did she run off with that kid?
- It looked like it.
- I'll find him.
- And the girl?
You wouldn't want us busting up a
budding romance like that, would you?
Don't bait me, Scavo!
He ain't in there.
- Where is he?
- How do I know?
Mr. Stewart doesn't
tell me his business.
He just drove away
some time ago.
His team and wagon are gone.
Thanks very much, Mrs. Michaels.
It's not important anyway.
There's only one road
he could have taken.
His brother's ranch.
Campbell insisted on seeing Adam.
When I told him he'd driven away,
he said it wasn't important.
- That all?
- They headed out of town.
I didn't tell them that Adam
was on his way to see you.
- Howie is the one that bunch is after.
- Where is Howie now?
I don't know.
I'll have to catch Adam.
There he is.
- What's the meaning of this?
- What's the idea? Where you going?
None of your business,
but I was going to see my brother.
In such a hurry? You mean
you were going to see your son.
- Where is he?
- I don't know.
- He's not at the Stewart ranch.
- No.
He ran off with that Mexican filly.
You do know where he is,
and you'd better tell me.
I don't know.
And even if I did, I wouldn't...
- Where's the kid?
- You're crazy, Campbell.
- You're insane, Campbell. You...
- Where is he?!
I don't know, I tell you.
I don't know.
Those men killed him.
Campbell and the others.
They're the only ones
who could have.
Because of me.
Well, I'll kill them too.
And I'll get Campbell first.
What's to be done now, John?
What Campbell is up to
is pretty clear.
And then we ride, like in old times.
Shoot him down.
No. That's what he wants us to do.
It would justify his violence.
You and the sheriff get word to
Jason Carr, Green and Tom Baines...
...to meet us at the freight office.
- All right, John.
- Maria, where's Howie?
- I hide him at the little ranch...
...of Miguel Ruiz,
once a friend of my father's.
- Why didn't you tell me?
- He was afraid you'd send him to jail.
He's getting his guns.
He swears he'll kill Campbell.
- I tried to stop him. He wouldn't listen.
- Come on.
- Why'd you tell him, Maria?
- I had to.
- Give me that gun, Howie.
- No. Stay back.
I know what I've gotta do.
Because you threw a lucky shot once,
you think you can do it again.
You wouldn't stand a chance.
Stand back, Uncle John.
Oh, please, Howie. Listen.
No.
You're really to blame
for all this.
You made my father come here, where
he had no place to be. Now he's dead.
You killed him as much as anybody,
because you wanted your law...
...to take care of everything.
You can look at it that way.
I am to blame.
But I'm not going to
have you killed too.
You're afraid to fight him.
Well, I'm not.
Give me the gun.
I'll handle this my way.
What are you planning to do,
serve some papers on Mr. Campbell?
Look, Howie, this is a man's job.
Then who'll do it? You?
Don't come any closer.
You're not...
He'll be all right. Look after him.
Keep him here till I get back.
Why the back door?
I wanted to see the town
before it saw me.
- Still coming in.
- All afternoon. Several of them.
Tell Jason and the others,
when they come...
...that things have been changed.
You're wearing a gun.
What's brought
this change in you?
- Howie.
- John, all this could end...
...if you'd send Maria
back to Campbell.
She's why he hates so much,
isn't she?
Partly.
If Maria went back
it would be the end of her.
Could you ask her to do it?
- No.
- I didn't think so.
This fight isn't only over a girl.
Campbell has grown
as big as he can within the law.
Now he's using violence
to take him to the top.
- I'm standing in his way.
- You'll be killed.
The last to fight
and the first to die.
No, you forget Adam.
Oh, you got a winner at last.
John Stewart himself.
- You must be Frank Scavo.
- That's right, Mr. Stewart.
What can I do for you?
Thought Wick Campbell
might be here.
No, he don't happen to be around.
Least I don't see him.
- You seen him, Drucker?
- Why, no, I ain't.
If there's anything
we can do to oblige you...
There's nothing right now.
Well, anytime.
Plan to be in Ocatilla long,
Mr. Scavo?
Why, yes. Come here
on account of the climate.
Campbell said
we'd get real healthy.
Recently it hasn't been too healthy
for several people.
But if we could have a few more
new, fine, upstanding citizens...
...like you men, Ocatilla would soon
get a name for itself.
Good night.
Come on.
Stewart.
Good night.
Stand up, Campbell.
Stand up.
You're a born sucker, Stewart.
Bigger than I ever seen.
Oh, yeah? You're pretty smart.
Now, Mr. Campbell
dreamed this one up.
He figured you'd come storming
after your brother's shooting.
And I got the privilege of greeting you
because your nephew killed my friend.
Make your first shot count, Drucker.
I always do.
Now they find you dead
because you came busting in here...
...trying to murder
poor Mr. Campbell.
I might even get a reward
out of this, eh? Sucker.
Find Stewart. Find him and kill him.
Liar. Bragged he was
a first-rate gunslinger.
Brandy, Kansas,
ride out and cover all roads.
- He'll be heading out of town.
- All right. Get moving.
Campbell, I saw him heading around
back of the freight office.
That's interesting.
All right, men.
Save the horseflesh.
Go to your homes.
You're to have no part of this.
What's got into you?
Trying to cut down Campbell alone.
- Didn't Corinne tell you?
- We're all in this, or will be.
That's what I'm trying to prevent.
Takes one man to stop Campbell.
Without him, the rest will leave.
I'm the reason for this trouble.
I wanna finish it.
This badge doesn't mean
anything anymore.
- Only a target for Campbell's guns.
- But you pinned it on me.
Forget it. There's no law in Ocatilla.
Stewart!
We know you're in there.
Come out or we're coming in.
I thought I got away safely.
I'd never bring them here.
Make it quick, Stewart.
Looks like we've got
all the foxes bottled up in one hole.
Cut loose.
Maybe it's only you they want,
Stewart, and not us.
But if they should break in here...
John, you can't do it.
Green may be right.
Do you think if they killed you,
that would save us?
You're the leader. Without you,
there'd be nothing to stop them.
What they would do here
could happen to any house in town.
We're in for a siege. Got nothing
to fight back with but two pistols.
We'll all die like rats in a trap.
I'm gonna run for it.
Shut up. Stay down.
John.
Jason, Tom, Henry.
These were my husband's.
I packed them away years ago.
Jason, better go in with Clyde.
Tom, cover this window here.
Henry, take the back door.
Corinne, I'm sorry
I had to bring this on you.
Don't be. I'm glad you're here, alive.
When daylight comes
so they can see who you are...
...I wish you'd leave.
Even if they hold you...
...you'll be safer than in this house.
- I want to be here.
Remember? I'm your best girl.
Bad men, they shoot everybody.
Hear?
Who are they shooting at?
People in the señora's house.
They kill.
You mean the people
in the freighter office?
Just a minute.
Where do you think you're going?
I just came into town.
I gotta see Campbell.
Campbell's down at the hotel.
Hold it.
Hey, if you're a gunslinger,
how come you ain't wearing a gun?
- I lost it.
- Tell that to Campbell.
It's Howie. Fill that hotel with lead.
You're lucky you made it.
- What kind of a fool are you?
- I made it, didn't I?
What is this? What's going on?
Here, sit down here.
Let's have a look at it.
- Is it bad?
- No.
I can fix it.
Make a tourniquet out of the sleeve.
I'll get some water and bandages.
- I told you to stay where you were.
- I came here to get a gun.
- My father's, in his desk.
- You'll have to fight.
- Go relieve Henry Green.
- There's no water to wash the wound...
...but I found this whiskey.
- No water?
A bullet smashed the water cooler.
Bullets, fighting, killing.
It's not the answer to anything.
Just like that boy I killed
in the streets.
No older than Howie.
Why did he come here?
Why did he travel 1000 miles
just to come under my gun?
Maybe it was meant to be.
He could have become
another Campbell.
Why don't they come after us
if they're going to?
We need a drink.
I don't believe in bottled bravery...
...but this will tone us all up.
Howie, will you bring in
some wood for the stove?
Howie?
John.
Howie's out there.
Crazy fool.
Haven't you any sense at all?
We need water, don't we?
I got it.
If there's anything else you need,
just let me know.
That's the last water they'll get.
I think you're
the steadiest woman on earth.
Am I?
- You're trembling.
- Yes.
I'm gonna tell you again,
leave this house.
The situation is bad.
The showdown can come any time.
I know that.
For myself, I'm not sorry
for any of this.
But I am sorry that there
didn't seem to be time enough...
...for us to get to know each other
better in the past.
Are you, now? Has time run out?
I'm not a doddering old lady yet.
I suppose you've known it
all along...
...but the way I feel
toward you this moment...
...is no different than the way
I've always felt about you.
It's taken this,
seeing you at your best...
...to make me realize it
when it's too late.
John, if you're making love to me,
I'm not gonna let you sit there...
...and act as though it were
the end of our lives.
There are gonna be no goodbyes.
I'm not leaving this house...
...and that's that.
- You must.
If I'm to die, I want it all at once
and with you.
I'm not going anyplace else
to die in little pieces.
If there's any of that whiskey left,
you bring the bottle to me.
I'd like a sip to stop
the shaking in my knees.
I mean it about the bottle.
I really do.
I'll join you.
I want you to know, John,
you got no kick coming from me.
I've never wanted
anything more than I've had.
Only a chance to live my life
without being afraid.
I guess this is as good a way
as any to prove it.
Stewart! Everybody!
They're coming at us.
What are we gonna do?
Campbell's with them.
They've got a woman.
It's Marva.
I want to talk to Sheriff Gibbons.
Talk to me, Campbell.
Not you, Stewart.
I'll get you later,
and it won't be to gab.
You and your nephew murdered
two of my men, and you'll pay for it.
What about my brother, Campbell?
What about him?
I wouldn't know.
I understand he committed suicide.
If you're still alive, sheriff, speak up.
This is Gibbons.
What do you want?
I have no quarrel with anyone in there
except the Stewarts.
The rest of you come out,
I'll let you go free.
We've heard that before.
Well, listen to your daughter.
Please. Oh, Clyde, please.
Mr. Campbell means what he says.
Come out, you and father
and Corinne and the others.
You'll be safe.
Clyde, do you hear me?
Yes, I hear you.
We've got a right to live our lives.
Why should you give up yours
for something someone else did?
This isn't your fight.
Oh, Clyde.
Please.
Please think of us just once.
Why should we all be killed?
He started it. He said so.
Go, Clyde, if you wish.
You've done your share.
All right, what's the answer?
If you got any ideas you can
hold out till help comes, forget them.
The town's all sewed up.
We've gotta say yes.
What am I gonna do?
I won't hold it against any of you.
Go on, run out, all of you.
We Stewarts don't need you.
Have you lost your reason? Are you
trying to turn your man into a coward?
- He'll die.
- He's not dead yet.
- Nor are any of the others.
- Tell them to snap it up.
Marva, you can't be idiot enough
to believe that this man here...
...will keep his word.
He'll kill them all
if they come out of that house.
Get off the street.
Look at him.
They're here for one reason only.
To kill.
Don't come out, Clyde.
Campbell's lying.
He'll never keep his promise.
I was crazy to think so.
Put them in the hotel
and lock them up.
Women sure jinx you, Campbell.
Watch that window.
Dynamite.
Must've broken into
the freighter warehouse.
Try to pick off
who's throwing it, Tom.
- That was close.
- Too close for Baines.
Blowing us apart, room by room.
John, you haven't got a prayer
against that dynamite.
You're right.
We'll go out the back door...
...one at a time, so they won't
have a bunch to shoot at.
Maybe they figure
they got most of us by now.
It would help. We'll head for the river.
That's the only way.
First one out will have the best chance.
That's you, Clyde, with that wound.
- He's really botched it now.
- I'll go anyway.
I've got to take that chance.
Wait 10 seconds, Clyde.
Stay close to the well.
Come on, you killers.
Try and stop us. Try!
They're coming out the front way.
Dad covered for us.
It's only the old man.
Come on.
Come in, sheriff.
Ann.
- What happened?
- Campbell's blowing up the town.
They've gone kill-crazy.
Ride to the Stewart ranch for help.
Ride fast.
You can make it by sunup.
No, no, Stephen. Don't go.
It ain't our fight. Think of the family.
If Campbell finds out...
Oh, please, please. You can't.
- Six wins.
- Well, what do you know, I win again.
No, you were on four.
Oh, I say I was on six.
- How lucky can a guy get?
- All right, stop it!
Ain't you had enough, Scavo?
Well, we're just
celebrating a victory.
What victory?
You give me one old man
and two shopkeepers.
Where's John Stewart and the boy?
For the 10th time,
I told you I blew them out of the creek.
And you were well-paid for it.
You been eating my food and drinking
my whiskey till it runs out of your ears.
- You forgot our travel expenses.
- Not another cent.
Bring in the safe, boys.
Hold it!
Take his gun.
All right.
You're overplaying
your hand, Scavo.
Yeah? Go on.
Open her up, Mr. Campbell.
Open it.
We'll let you see how fair and even
we divide the money among us...
...so you'll know
we're not cheating you.
On second thought, we'll split it later.
You know we'll be honest.
All right, you got what you want.
Now I don't need you.
I don't need any of you.
I can get 50 men better than you.
So get out of my town.
Your town?
Ain't you heard?
This is our town.
Come on, boys,
we're drinking on Mr. Campbell.
I have looked for her,
like you paid me.
- I have found her.
- Maria? Where is she?
She is now at the ranchita
of Don Miguel.
- Maria, you must talk to me.
- There is nothing to say.
Do not come near me.
You have killed.
Only because of you.
Because of you and John Stewart.
It is not true. You wanted power.
No. Only you.
Thinking about you
has made me crazy.
I would pray that I were ugly...
...so that you would never
look at me again.
No, Maria. You and I
will always be together.
They're looting Ocatilla,
but it doesn't matter.
We'll rebuild it. We'll start over.
No. No!
You're the only thing I ever wanted.
Campbell!
You saved me the trouble
of finding you.
- I'm unarmed.
- There's an accounting to be made.
My brother, the others and Howie.
You'll be unhappy to know
he's going to live, thanks to Maria.
No. No, I'm glad.
I made a mistake.
You... You'll give me a chance?
You'll be that fair?
I'm walking out of that door for a
minute, then I'm gonna walk back in.
One of your men
did that to Howie.
Find yourself a gun,
and when I come in, use it.
You! You had a gun.
The fine gun that I gave you.
- Where is it?
- I do not know.
- Where is it?!
- I do not know!
Liar!
No! No, I haven't got a gun!
I have two.
This one belonged
to my brother Adam.
Take mine. It's loaded.
Either you ride to the
marshal's office with me in Tucson...
...or pick it up and use it.
You watch out for Howie,
Maria, I'm going to town.
Haven't they done enough damage?
Marva.
It's John.
Corinne. Marva.
- Corinne. Marva.
- John.
Stick around, Stewart.
You trying to wreck
my organization, Stewart?
I have wrecked it. Campbell's dead,
and the others have gone.
Except for me.
Except for you.
Unbuckle your gun belt.
Toss it down.
Them two gals I got locked upstairs
should make my ride to the border...
...real pleasant. Especially that
pretty gal of yours, Corinne.
Get up.
It's on this time to stay, Clyde.
And I hope you find your old job
very dull from now on.
- I hope so, John.
- Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Goodbye, Padre.
You did a first-rate job.
Thank you, John.
Haven't you forgotten
something, Howie?
Oh, I forgot to pay.
For you, sir. It was a nice wedding.
I don't think it's quite enough
for a double wedding.
There you are.
Goodbye, everybody.
- Ready, Mrs. Stewart?
- Ready, Mr. Stewart.
