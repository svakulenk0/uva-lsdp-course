For years following the Civil War
the question was whether Indians
or the United States Army
would control Arizona Territory.
Bands of hostile Apaches
roamed the countryside.
Only the courage and dedication
of a few brave fighting men
kept the Territory from being
completely overrun.
In the summer of 1869,
Cochise, bold chief of
the Chiricahua Apaches,
made a brutal vow to kill every man,
woman and child in southern Arizona.
Many of the settlers in the area
had already felt the fury
of Cochise's bloody oath.
A small detail of
United States cav alrymen
were escorting the survivors to
a hastily-established outpost.
There, the Army was determined
to make a last-ditch stand.
I know how to spell our name.
Go work.
Hey! Hey, look!
It's Bruce.
Don't get your hopes up, sis,
when the Captain comes courting
he doesn't bring a crowd of people.
Ellen.
- It's good to see you, Bruce.
Is something wrong?
Your pa at the house?
- Yeah.
Let's go talk to him.
Isn't that the Carter family?
What's left of them.
Apaches hit this morning.
Your place will be next.
Sure glad you came to stand
them off, Captain.
We make our stand at Apache Wells.
Oh, you're going to have a hard time
talking Pa into leaving.
They all wanted to stay, too.
The Apaches made a pretty good
argument against it.
Sergeant Walker.
Have some of the men
find their wagon.
Pitch it up and bring it
to the house.
Captain, wait. Don't you think you
ought to talk to Pa first?
I think he'll understand.
Pa!
Captain Coburn.
Mrs Malone.
Cochise's gone on the war path.
- What?
We're escorting the settlers
into Apache Wells.
I didn't ask for any escorting.
Neither did they, Cochise sent his
braves to burn them out.
Pa knows how to deal
with the Apaches.
There's no dealing with them, Mike.
How many guns do you have?
Just this one.
She's never failed me yet.
Look, Mr Malone.
Our job is to protect you people.
We can't put soldiers
at every farm house.
You've got to come in where our
strength is concentrated.
You better listen to him, Harry.
Kate.
We have given ten long years of
hard work to build up this place.
And you'll give your life
if you try to hang onto it.
Cochise made a vow he'd kill every
white man in southern Arizona.
Looks like he's already started.
Now this is no time to argue.
I'm not going to let you stay here
and get killed.
Well, I guess it's the only way.
It'll take me a little
while to pack.
Sorry, ma'am, we can't wait.
Troopers will bring
your wagon around.
Be ready to go when it gets here.
Come on, Ma.
Pick up what you can, kids.
Captain, shall I order
the men to dismount?
Sergeant Walker gives the orders.
I know that, sir, but the men
asked me to talk to you.
They're complaining you're driving
them too hard. They need a rest.
They can rest when we
get back to camp.
I know, Captain, but we got to
stop somewhere.
There's water, hay for the horses.
We can stand off the Apaches here
as good as any other place.
Bodine, are you talking command
of this outfit?
No, sir.
When I was a sergeant the officers
used to listen to what I had to say.
Is that why they broke
you to Corporal?
They'll need me again, sir.
Maybe they will, but by God I don't.
If you give me one more
bit of trouble
I'll bust you all the way
back to Privey.
Now, mount up.
Yes, sir.
Locking horns with
the Captain again, Bodine?
I don't back off for nobody,
Sergeant.
Well, that's why you're here.
You and a dozen more like it
that nobody else could handle.
Sergeant, I want to tell you
something.
He might break the rest of them
but he won't even make a dent in me.
Sergeant Walker?
- Hello.
Put a match to it, no use leaving
anything for Cochise.
Whoa!
Captain Coburn drove
the settlers hard all day,
but nightfall and weariness
finally forced a halt.
I want your complete
cooperation tonight.
If we're attacked they'll probably
hit the wagons and the horses first.
I want you people to bed down
right up there in those rocks.
There'll be no fires, no noise.
Be ready to move out at daylight.
We don't have much water, sir.
- I know.
Give the women and children what they
need, save the rest for the horses.
Get them started, Sergeant.
- Yes, sir.
All right. Bring your belongings
and come with me.
Look, Captain,
what about us troopers?
We're just as thirsty as they are.
We've been riding in
the hot sun all day.
It won't hurt you to go one night
without water.
Look, Capt...
- That's all, Bodine.
You know, we'd better get ready to
help if there's Indian trouble.
Let's ask the Captain if he'll
lend us a couple of rifles.
You know how I am with guns, Mike.
Can't hit the broad side of a barn!
Well, if those Apaches get close,
you'll learn fast enough.
Any chance those Apaches will
hit tonight, Captain?
They don't let me in on their
plans always, Mike.
Just try to keep ready.
Doug and I would like to help if
you'd let us have a couple rifles.
I appreciate the offer but I don't
have enough guns to arm my own men.
Well, then I guess we'll have to
sharpen up the old axe, huh?
Many a battle has been won with less.
Hey, Mike, Doug?
Come on, give me help.
Here. Ma and Pa went up the hill,
you can take them up, huh?
All right.
Oh!
It's been a long time since we've
been able to talk to each other.
Over a month, Colonel hasn't been
too generous with leave time lately.
Oh, well you won't have
any more excuses.
I'll be right there at Apache Wells.
I won't be looking for excuses.
Come on, I'll walk you.
Mm, uh-uh. I like it right here.
Listen to that lonely sound.
Probably a lonely Apache scout.
Did you come out here just to
protect me from the Indians?
Well, not exactly but...
They'd give anything for a scalp
as pretty as that one.
How about you? Hmm?
It'd be awful easy to hand it to you.
Why don't you?
I'm not a very good bet for
a girl like you.
Men in my business don't
stick around too long.
Your warning comes
a bit late, Bruce.
I'm going up the hill, see you later.
You know that's all
the water we have.
You'd never do that if you weren't
hiding behind those Captain's bars.
I'm not hiding behind anything,
Bodine.
I fought in this army for ten years
before they pinned these on me.
I don't need them now.
Oh?
You mean you're willing to forget
you're an officer
and reckon man to man?
I've tried everything else with you.
I guess that's the only language
you understand.
Captain! Captain!
Captain, you'll kill him, sir.
Pick those horses up and put
a guard on the water.
Yes, sir.
Apache Wells, Arizona territory.
Colonel Homer Reed in command
of a troop of cavalry
whose assignment was to hold
the lonely outpost at any cost
and to protect the settlers
in the adjacent area.
Nearby families had already
taken refuge here,
only the most distant ranches
remained to be accounted for.
Attention! At ease.
That Captain Coburn's outfit?
- No sir, that's the morning patrol.
Captain was due back yesterday,
wasn't he, sir?
I'll send a detail if they don't
return by nightfall.
The old man is lost if Coburn
isn't around.
It'd suit me if that stiff-necked
Captain never came back.
Bugler! Sound assembly.
Take care of your wounded.
The rest of you, hold your posts.
They might come back.
Good work, Sergeant.
- Thank you, sir.
Captain and me have ridden together
for a long time.
Can't lose him this close to home.
These Apaches are getting bolder.
I thought they'd follow you
into camp.
Maybe next time they will.
I'm getting sick and tired of
having to turn and run
every time an Apache
sticks his head up.
When are we getting those
new rifles, Colonel?
I've put in requests at least
a dozen times.
Army keeps sending back excuses
instead of rifles.
They give us an impossible job
and no tools to do it with.
How long do you think we could hold
this place against an all-out attack?
Not long with our old worn-out guns.
You think Cochise would risk all his
forces on a frontal assault?
He's smart, Colonel.
When our patrols can't stand
and fight it shows weakness.
He won't be long in
taking adv antage of it.
At least you got the settlers here
where our power is concentrated.
Show them where to set up camp,
will you?
Yes, sir.
Bodine.
Why didn't you pick him up?
I don't know what you're
talking about.
Stand up when I'm talking to you!
You heard me call.
With all that shooting?
I didn't hear nothing.
That beating the Captain gave you
didn't teach you much, did it?
Oh, I haven't forgotten anything
about that, Sergeant.
He did a pretty good job on ya.
- Yeah.
You...
Anybody else want to
take a look, huh?
Anybody else want to take a look?
Look! Come on, look!
Anybody else down here?
Come on, look at it!
Don't think that this gives
Captain Coburn the whip hand.
Oh I'm going to be a good soldier
from now on.
Every time the Captain rides out of
this camp I'll be right behind him.
He catches a bullet I want to
make sure he's dead.
Malone's old rifle had
finally failed him.
Ironically, an Apache bullet
had caught him
just as safety seemed assured.
He's dead!
I thought we'd made it but...
He was laying dead on that seat
when we got in.
If we joined the Army...
...could we get some rifles, Captain?
I'd see that you get guns some way.
Good 'cause we're ready to fight!
Stand at... ease.
Colonel Reed had fired off an angry
demand to his home base.
After two weeks of anxious waiting,
a reply finally came.
All right, what is it?
A shipment of new lever-action
rifles came in from back east.
They're sending you 40 of them.
- When do we get them?
You'll have to meet them beyond
the Chiricahua mountains.
They hired some scouts to
bring them that far.
Figured you fellas were the best
to sneak them past Cochise.
They sure give us
the tough end of it.
It's up to you, Bruce.
We'll get them through.
- Going to have your hands full.
Those mountains are crawling
with Apache.
Three different bunches of them
gave me a run.
I had to come around here through
the Apache pass to get by them.
May as well back the same way.
Keep your eyes open.
The guns will be here at
Hatchet Rock tomorrow, noon.
Hatchet Rock.
Might as well keep it, Captain.
Might come in handy.
Thank you.
You've done a good job,
the rest is up to us now.
Better get some rest.
- Thank you, sir.
Well, Bruce the Army finally
came through, 40 repeating rifles.
That will improve our
chances against Cochise.
Improve them? Trade our old
singleshots for those lever actions,
we can hold off all the Apache
in this territory.
We're going to have to
bring them in first.
I'll get some men together now, sir.
Take as many men as you need,
I don't want to be left shorthanded
but take enough troopers
to get the job done.
We'll sneak out of here after dark,
Apache won't even know we're gone.
Oh, Captain.
- Yes, sir?
That last mission you were on...
...there is a rumour that you
beat up one of the men.
Colonel, you know how rumours get
started on a small post like this.
This is a serious matter, Captain.
I'll overlook it this time,
but from now on try...
Baby them a little more?
Captain, there are two ways
to get men through a door,
you can kick them through or
you can lead them through.
That's right, sir, but they wind up
the same place anyway.
Take a look out there, Colonel.
It's not exactly the cream
of the crop,
yet we're expected to make soldiers
out of all of them.
I know it's a ragtag bunch they
sent us to fight Indians,
but this mission is vital, Bruce.
We can't afford any trouble
in the ranks.
I don't expect any trouble, sir.
Sir...
With the Captain's permission,
I'd like to go along on this one.
You sure got a sixth sense for
something big, haven't you, Sergeant?
Well sir, I been around long enough
to get these stripes here,
I'm bound to know if
something's going on.
I see.
It's the rifles, isn't it, sir?
Yes, it is. Let's just keep it
between the two of us.
The less the men know, the less
the Apache can get out of them
in case they get captured.
Attention.
I need ten men for a mission,
a very important one...
...and it's very dangerous.
I'm asking for volunteers.
Come on, Doug!
What's the matter with you, Fuller?
What about you, Higgins?
Thank you, men. We'll leave tonight.
Check your equipment,
take care of your horses.
Dismissed.
Captain?
- What is it, Sergeant?
You said this was an important
mission but...
It is.
You sure haven't got the best men
riding with us.
Those two green Malone boys,
it's their first time out.
Bodine, he's always trouble.
He'll do, Sergeant.
Have them ready after chow.
- Yes, sir.
They're proud to be riding
with you, Bruce.
Glad to have them.
They'll make good soldiers.
Watch out for both of them,
especially Doug.
Mike can take care of himself
but Doug...
...he'll need help at first.
I'll keep an eye on him.
I guess it's because I'm older that
they seem like such boys to me.
They'll be men when we come back.
They're waiting for us, Doug
we've got to go.
Goodbye, Mama.
Boy, take care of Doug, huh?
Goodbye, sis.
- Bye.
Goodbye, sis.
- Take care.
Everybody is counting on you, Bruce.
You've got to get those
rifles through.
We'll do our best, sir.
Under the cover of darkness,
Captain Coburn moved out with his
little band of volunteers.
Everything depended on his success
in reaching the rendezvous with
the supply wagon and the 40 rifles.
Coburn led his men deep into
the Chiricahua mountains.
When they reached Apache Pass
the Captain sensed that hostile eyes
were watching from the high rocks.
Have a look now, sir.
Apache can hide in a badger hole.
Hold up a couple of minutes,
I want to take a look.
Yes, sir.
Apaches wouldn't take on this many
soldiers would they, Mike?
You're not scared, are you?
A little, aren't you?
Of course not.
That's what we joined up for,
to get a crack at them.
I think I can shoot once but
I wonder if I'll be able to reload
with a bunch of Indians
hollering down on me.
You'll do fine.
Just remember we'll be fighting them
side by side.
Hooo!
All right, two men dismount
and take cover.
He signalled to someone up there
before I got him.
That means they know we're coming.
You look a little pale, boys.
I thought you wanted to
see 'em butchered.
Leave those two kids with the horses.
Assign a rearguard and the rest
of you come with me.
Yes, sir.
Malone brothers,
stay with the horses.
Yes, sir.
Bodine.
- Yes, Sergeant?
You, you post the rearguard
and cover.
The rest of you come with me.
Doug!
Look, I saw one.
- What?
I saw one up there!
Let's go get him.
But, the Sergeant told us
to stay here.
But, he didn't tell us not to fight.
I'll circle around this way,
you come up the back of him.
Mike?
Come on now, you've got to get
your feet wet sometime.
This is as good a place as any.
I'm scared, Mike. I'm scared.
I never should have joined the Army.
Look, I know how you feel,
everybody's nervous at first.
You'll get over it once you
get into the action.
Well, come on!
Let's go get us an Apache.
Mike. Mike!
Doug! Come on, Doug.
I'm coming, Mike.
Doug, help me! Doug!
Doug, come on help me.
Mike!
Mike!
Where's Mike?
I tell you where he is,
the Apaches carried him away.
This kid didn't have the guts
to help his brother.
I can't believe that, Doug.
It's true.
He just kept calling me.
I couldn't make myself go to him.
I can still hear him.
I can still hear him
calling for help.
Fetch the horses.
On your feet.
Mike!
Mike!
Mike, Mike!
Please, please let me go!
I've got to help him.
Mike, please!
- Take it easy, kid.
Let me go. Let me go!
Shut up!
- Mike, Mike!
Mike! Mike!
- Doug. Listen, Doug.
Now you listen to me.
Its too late to help your brother.
He's dead, you understand?
He's dead.
Get him on a horse.
The troopers were on the run.
The Captain couldn't afford
to lose one more man.
If those 40 repeating rifles didn't
get back to Apache Wells,
Cochise would massacre every one
of its defenders.
As far as we go, Sergeant.
We going to be here long, Captain?
I don't think so, why?
I've a feeling we're being watched.
You could be right.
Dismount.
Keep your rifles handy.
We going to go back the same way
we came, sir?
I don't think it makes any difference
how we go back, Sergeant.
If we get hit again we'll just
have to make a run for it.
We left half our men
lying dead back there.
Yes, sir.
Some of the best ones, too.
There's only seven of us left
to get them guns through.
Six.
Six men and a worthless, yellow kid.
Don't be too hard on him, Captain.
Remember that was his first time
under fire.
That's no excuse. I've got no use
for a coward, Sergeant.
Yes, sir.
Bodine.
- Hmm?
When we going to get out of here?
- Shh! When I say so.
Come on, we got a couple of
pretty good horses.
What are we waiting for?
I've still got something
to settle with that Captain.
Get it settled, I don't intend to
ride back to that death trap.
I promise you one thing, we'll never
go back with this outfit.
Hold your fire.
Glad you're here, Captain.
I didn't aim to wait long.
Kind of jumpy, aren't you?
- There's good reason.
We come within a ace of tangling with
a herd of Apache about an hour ago.
Chiricahuas?
No, them's Tontos.
Them's wearing war paint.
Seem to knows where they's going.
To join Cochise.
That's my guess.
We're shorthanded,
be glad to have you ride with us.
Not on your life.
My contract called for me to bring
this wagon here and no further.
I value my head too much to travel
into Chiricahua country
with old Cochise on the war path
like he is.
You got a point there.
Army doesn't give us any such choice.
That's your problem, Captain.
Mind if we take off now?
All right gather around, men.
This is what we came for.
No other gun of its kind
in southern Arizona.
Oh-wee!
With these the Indians could wipe out
every white man in this territory.
I've got to get them through to
Apache Wells and we will,
else there will be seven more dead
troopers lying in these hills.
Now, if we are overrun...
...the last man alive will
light this fuse...
...and stay with this wagon until
it's blown to hell.
Are there any questions?
Good.
Sergeant, want me to take the team?
Sure. Go ahead, Bodine.
Hey! I thought you said we weren't
going to go back with this outfit.
You just relax, Barrett, just relax.
There's been a change of plans.
I didn't tell you to stop, Bodine.
Captain, it's a long pull up
that hill, the horses are winded.
All right, dismount.
We'll rest here for a minute.
Good shot, Barrett.
Come on, tie him up.
The rest of you keep those rifles
pointing in the air.
Now, me and Barrett are taking off
with these rifles.
Don't worry, we're not hogs,
these guns are worth plenty.
We might need some help.
The Captain didn't
offer you anything
when he asked you to volunteer.
Go along with me,
I'll make you rich.
You do that and you'll sign the death
warrant of everybody at Apache Wells.
Don't worry about that, these guns
will make us king of the mountain.
Higgins, what about you?
I know you like money.
Come on, you'll never have a chance
like this with that uniform.
Eight dollars a month
don't pile up very fast.
I knew you'd see it my way.
Well, Fuller?
Oh, that's right.
You'd rather have the Captain
chew your tail out every day,
or are you waiting for the Apaches
to come along and finish the job?
You'll be running the rest
of your life, Fuller.
You'll have to hide your face
everywhere you go.
How long do you think he's been
called Fuller?
That's right, I changed my name
to get into the Army.
I sure don't mind changing it
to get out.
Right, and when we get to where
we're going, which is Mexico,
soon as we cross that border
you can call yourself lucky
when those senoritas start
swarming all over you.
Kid, how about making it unanimous?
Oh, come on now!
You sure you don't want to
face your folks
right after letting your
brother get killed?
What about them?
We can't just leave them
here to die.
Ah, don't worry about it.
We'll let them loose
before we leave.
They'll make their way back
all right.
Come on, kid!
You coming with us or not?
All right.
As long as you're letting them go.
Pack those rifles on the team,
we're heading across country.
I'd offer to take you with us,
Sergeant,
but you might slow us down.
Damn you, Bodine.
Well, Captain...
You've been top dog for a long time.
You know there's an old saying,
"Every dog has his day".
And I'm doing the barking now.
I thought that uniform would do
something for any man that wore it,
even you, Bodine.
Well, it did something for me.
It got me what I've been
waiting for.
Chance to turn traitor?
Well, I guess it's all in the way
you look at it.
See, the uniform I
started out in was grey.
When I was captured at Shiloh
they gave me a choice...
...to rot in a stinking
Yankee prison camp...
...or join you Blue Coats
fighting Indians.
You see, Captain Sir,
I'm sort of a galvanised Yankee.
I don't have too much respect
for this blue outfit.
I don't imagine you had too much
loyalty for the grey one, either.
I want to tell you something,
Captain.
Changing uniforms has
taught me one lesson.
A man only owes one loyalty...
...to himself.
Come on, Bodine. We're ready to go.
All right head on out,
I'll be with you in a minute.
Higgins, pick up that loose stuff.
- All right.
This is your idea, Captain.
You ordered the last man to stay
with the wagon...
...till it was blown to hell.
Well, you're the last man.
See you in hell, Captain Sir.
Sergeant!
Sergeant, can you hear me?
Yes, sir...
I can hear you.
I can see, too.
Listen, I, my rope is tied to the
wagon but I don't think yours is.
Can you roll away from here?
I'm sorry, sir. I, I can't make it.
It's a long way to Apache Wells,
Sergeant, think you can make it?
I sure don't want to stay here, sir.
You're going to have to rest.
Now, don't you go passing out on me.
I won't pass out on you, Captain.
Just keep talking to me.
I don't know why you don't go ahead
and leave me here anyway I'm...
I'm slowing you down.
I know how determined you are
to get those guns.
Now, you listen to me,
we'll make it back together
or we won't make it at all.
You got more guts than
any man I ever knew.
Must have been bred in you.
Not exactly.
Actually, I come from a long line
of losers, Sergeant.
Matter of fact my family motto was,
"If at first you don't succeed...
"...give up".
You sure switched that around
somewhere.
I tried to.
When I was nine years old,
I'll never forget that,
big, old kid knocked me down.
I just lay there and thought it'd
be safer, till he kicked me.
Well, something must've popped
inside of me because I got up
and fought back for the first time
in my life and I liked it.
Did you whip him?
No.
No, he beat the tar out of me.
But, I learnt something though.
We're all going to die someday.
It's better to die fighting than
lying with your face in the dirt.
That sort of spirit sure made
a hell of a soldier out of you.
Yeah, I knew I wanted the Army
when I was 15.
Ran away from home to join up.
Clawed and scratched through the
ranks till I was a top cat like you.
Of course, with my background
if it hadn't been for the war,
I'd never have made Officer.
I won these bars fighting
in the field.
There's going to be a star
there someday, Captain.
There won't be anything there
if I don't get those rifles back.
Yes, sir.
Come on.
I'm sorry, Captain.
Looks like I'm going to
have to carry you.
Now, look dead, will you?
You couldn't have found
a better decoy!
Here he comes.
Colonel Reed.
Get him to the hospital tent!
Sergeant Walker, Captain?
- Yes, sir.
The guns and the rest of the men,
where are they?
We lost them, sir.
Step inside, Captain.
I want to see Captain Coburn.
- You can't see him now.
But, I can't...
No, Captain I won't allow another
mission to leave here.
You said the Tonto Apache
were joining Cochise.
What does that mean?
They're preparing for
an all-out attack.
Exactly, and they might hit
any time.
That's why we've got to have
those rifles.
I need every man here
to have even an outside chance of
defending this place.
I can't send half my command off
on some wild goose chase now.
Then give me four men,
I'll get those rifles back.
You had 11 when you lost them.
That mean I can't go, Colonel?
That's exactly what I mean!
You failed once, Captain
and put us in deep trouble.
One more failure would mean
certain disaster.
Don't you understand?
We've got the fight of our lives
trying to hold this place.
You see those people out there?
They were all depending on you.
And they'll all be dead
this time tomorrow,
but by God we'll go down fighting.
And you're asking me to send
more troopers?!
What's the matter with you?
I am relieving you
of your command, Captain.
You'll fight when we're hit but you
have no further authority here.
If we survive, a court martial will
decide your future in the Army.
That will be all, Captain.
I said, that will be all!
Ellen!
Sorry, Ellen I wanted to
tell you myself.
That'd make it a little easier
for you.
Easier?
Both my brothers are gone and you're
going to make it easier for me.
How?
You said you'd watch out for them!
You promised to bring them back!
Why didn't you?
I tried. When the Apache hit,
I tried to put them in a safe place.
A safe place?
You stand there without a scratch
yet both my brothers are dead
and you left them in a safe place?!
Ellen, didn't the Sergeant tell you?
Doug's not dead, he's alive!
Oh I don't believe you!
They're both dead.
No, they're not.
Well then, where is he?
Where's Doug?
He deserted, but he is alive.
You're lying!
Doug would never desert,
he's too loyal.
Oh, I knew I shouldn't have
let him join the Army.
He wasn't the kind to make
a good soldier.
He was so timid and didn't
like fighting.
He couldn't even stand
the sight of blood.
But, he'd never desert
Mother and me.
It's true, Ellen, he went with them.
Well, then they forced him to go.
They forced him!
If he's alive I know he'd be back.
Just as well get that out of
your mind, he's not coming back.
Why?
Because he is a deserter and if
he comes back he'll be shot.
You could, couldn't you?
You could shoot a poor,
frightened boy!
Oh, it's funny how blind
I have been about you.
It's funny I didn't see it long ago
the way that you force your men,
expecting them to be
as strong as you are!
Well, you're cruel, Bruce,
cruel and brutal!
The way you beat up that man
coming up here!
You beat his face to a pulp because
he wanted a dipper of water?!
Oh, it's funny I didn't see then
how truly heartless you are.
No wonder Doug ran off, no wonder
they all went, you drove them to it!
They ran off to get away from you.
Now, just a minute!
Maybe I did make a mistake,
but you might as well hear
all of the story.
Doug didn't desert
to get away from me.
He could've saved Mike's life
and he didn't do it.
He didn't want to come back and
face you, that's why he deserted.
No. No!
Coburn knew that because of
his failure
the entire camp could be
overrun by the Apaches.
The Colonel had ordered him
confined to post
but a heavy weight of guilt made him
decide to disobey that order
and take the gamble of going alone
after the guns.
Soldier.
Yes, sir?
I need your sidearm.
Do you mind saddling that horse?
- Yes, sir.
The Captain hoped to pick up the
track of the rifles by daybreak.
He studied the trail taken
by the deserters.
At least he had a fresh horse
for the search ahead.
Whoa!
Your pack horse just about had it.
Riding all night through
these mountains,
I bet we didn't cover ten miles.
That's right, Fuller, we didn't
run into any Apache, either.
Now look, we'll hole up here,
hide our v aluable merchandise.
You keep talking about how
v aluable these are.
I wonder if we'll live long enough
to cash them in.
Know what your trouble is, Higgins?
You don't have any faith in me.
Yeah, it about sums it up.
Give me a hand here, hold it up.
You treat all this stuff
with love and care, boys.
This here rifle I'm holding...
...is worth a thousand dollars
in pure, raw gold.
Ooh-wee!
Yeah but worth's one thing,
getting's another.
Don't you worry about that, Higgins,
I'll get it.
I'll get a thousand dollars apiece
for these rifles, maybe more.
See, boys...
...I'm a first-class salesman,
a travelling salesman.
This here's my sample case.
How far you travelling, Bodine?
- Oh, not too far.
My best customer is up
in those hills somewhere.
Cochise?
That's right, boy.
Apache gold is what I'm dealing for.
You said we were going to sell
those guns in Mexico!
What's the matter, sonny,
you getting cold feet?
Want to go back... to a firing squad?
I'll be glad to dump these rifles.
We can start making better time.
Our next stop will be Mexico where
all those senoritas hang out.
Yeah, and ol' Cochise's next stop
will be Apache Wells.
Well, I'm glad you boys are
beginning to appreciate
just how well I use this
head of mine.
What are you talking about?
Ha, the Army will be too busy
fighting Cochise
to send anybody chasing us.
You already got the Army wiped out
and you ain't even found Cochise.
There you go worrying again,
Higgins. I won't have to find him.
I get close enough,
his braves will find me.
They'll cut your throat before you
get a chance to talk to him.
Oh no, this is my insurance.
He needs these guns a lot more
than he needs my scalp.
Keep a sharp lookout.
Time enough to let down after
we get across the border.
Come on, let's go.
Sonny boy, you take care
of the horses.
Listen, I'm going to go up there
and pick me out a spot.
Why don't you all go around the
other side, you know, just in case.
Good idea.
The Captain would have given anything
to get a crack at Bodine,
but recovering the guns was
his prime concern now.
Bodine was hurried up
into the mountains
where Cochise waited with
a party of braves.
Soldier, you are a very brave man...
...or a fool.
I'm neither one, just a hunter...
...out after big game.
The hunter was captured by the game
he was seeking.
It's the only way I could get to
see the mighty Cochise.
The Army insults me!
Sending an underling to parlay!
Nobody sent me, I came on my own.
The White Eyes do not let
their soldiers ride alone
through the Chiricahuas.
Nobody gave me permission to come.
Then you deserter.
If you want to call it that.
A man who turns on his friends
cannot be trusted by his enemies.
We will talk no more.
Now, wait a minute, wait a minute!
I'm not asking you to trust me.
You have more of these?
...if you want them.
Show me the rifles.
I am not like your people,
my word can be trusted.
When I see the rifles,
you will get the Apache gold that
means so much to the White Eyes.
Coburn trailed the deserters back to
where they stood guard over the guns
waiting for Bodine's return.
Higgins, get away from him!
Let me get a shot at him.
Now, let's go
get us an Apache.
I'm scared, Mike.
I'm scared!
I never should have joined the Army.
Get out of the way, Higgins.
That's no excuse.
I've got no use
for a coward.
Captain!
Captain!
Get him up, get him off of me!
Doug.
That kid!
I should have known.
The guns!
Where are they?
- Now look!
He say, two men ride away
with horses.
We will follow.
But, if this is a trick,
YOU will be the first to die.
Cochise knew he must
keep those rifles
from reaching the cav alry
at Apache Wells.
It's no use trying to outrun them
dragging these pack horses.
Give me a hand, will you, Doug?
You going to fight them here, sir?
I'll try slow them down, it's up to
you to get the rifles through.
But, I won't leave you
here alone, Captain.
You're going to obey orders, soldier.
- Yes, sir.
Sure feels good fighting on
the right side for a change.
Come on, help me load these.
- Yes, sir.
Better get going, hadn't you, Doug?
- Yes, sir.
Hup. Hup!
With five guns,
Coburn hoped to buy enough time
for Doug to get to Apache Wells.
It's Coburn.
It's Coburn!
Wait a minute, Chief, it's no trick.
I've got the same rifle he has,
I'll get him out of there for you.
I'll get those rifles for you.
At ease, soldier.
There are your rifles, Colonel.
Break them out.
Issue one to each man.
Captain Coburn stayed behind
to fight off the Indians, sir.
Alone?
- Yes, sir.
He wouldn't let me stay.
He said it's the only way we could
get the guns through.
He could still be alive.
Corporal.
Captain Coburn's in trouble.
I need some volunteers. Mount up.
Think you can ride, son?
Yes, sir!
Go get him.
Yes, sir.
Bodine was caught between the Army
and hostile Apaches.
All he could do was try to
save his own hide now.
Hyah!
Yes, sir.
Captain sir.
Captain Coburn?
Captain Coburn?
Everything's all right, Doug.
Everything's going to be all right.
Attention!
Forward!
Ho!
Go ahead, Doug.
Oh, Doug!
Good work, Captain.
For once I am glad you
disobeyed orders.
So, am I, sir.
The boy made the difference.
Go ahead, Captain.
