.
Fire, water, wind,
earth and emptiness...
Five core elements of life
that once inspired a book.
The Book of Fate.
Far away from here
there was a mythical world -
free of suffering and injustice.
But it wasnt enough.
People wanted to play God...
They created a pen
to control the Book of Fate.
Mightier than a sword,
it could write off deeds -
and bring back the dead.
But the book gave power,
power caused fear -
and fear brought suffering.
And from the suffering arose a war.
Darkness fell on earth, making
demands on the pen and the book.
But the book was gone.
lt was thought
to be lost forever -
but hundreds of years later
it reappeared -
on a small planet called Earth.
The prophecy says:
Only the chosen will get
a second chance from the book.
The destiny of the chosen one
is to guide the book back.
But his journey will be long,
filled with errors and grief.
This is his story.
THE BOOK OF FATE
Did you hear their heavy steps?
I did, and I saw them.
Not human.
Wheres the cross?
Somewhere in here.
Its goIden, up to your waist.
You wont need me, wiII you?
-Youre a priest.
The onIy one who can read.
Think of our innocent sister.
It is aIready noon.
We must go on.
CarefuI, brother.
CaIm down, girI.
YouII be fine.
Get up, girI.
You mustnt stay here.
Sergei!
Can you see anything?
Viktor! HeIp!
Sergei! HeIp!
What a way to die...
-We Ieft him there!
This pIace is cursed.
I said we shouIdnt come here.
Our own brother, dead...
Lets Ieave whiIe we can.
Be quiet, Viktor! Tatjana is
turning into a monster Iike that.
She has been bitten
by the deviI himseIf.
We must find the cross first.
And we cant! -WeII find it.
But wiII it save our sister
if we take it to her bedside?
The cross and the text on it
wiII save Tatjana.
But were running out of time.
The sun wiII soon set.
Even the cross will be
powerless after the sunset.
YouII be fine.
Dont worry.
CaIm down.
YouII soon get some heIp.
Who are you?
WeII take care of this.
Its not too Iate.
The brothers can heIp her.
They went to get this.
The cross...
Perhaps it doesnt even exist.
Perhaps its just a taIe.
Quick, into the haIIway!
Is this the one?
Is that the speII?
But this book, this is...
Wheres the cross?
We need it.
You know about the cross.
My brother and the cross
are somewhere up there.
How do we get them down?
-NataIie...
Youre too weak for them.
God wiII protect me.
-Not in here.
NataIie, take the priest
and the cross out of here!
Priest!
Take the cross to the graveyard!
You!
What do you want?
Ive never Iiked you.
Id waste it soon
if I were you.
Shut up, wiII you!
I smeII fear.
Shut up!
You dont know this scoundreI.
Same difference.
My brother and I wiII bury him.
You wiII hang
in the morning, boy.
WeII see about that, moron.
Im warning you,
if you wont go by horse now -
youII go feet first
in the morning!
Wrong town, dog!
The saIoon is cIosed.
Were out of Iiquor.
Do you wish to die?
Mom!
No!
No!!
I knew it!
Youre causing troubIe again.
Things were just fine...
-For you, perhaps.
This bunch is pure troubIe
but youve done nothing.
Ive got one of them in jaiI.
And he wiII never hang,
aIthough he deserves to.
You! Youre defending a man
who shot his own.
The truth is, another innocent
died because of you.
This time I wont...
-Men coming! At least four.
Hes coming to get his brother.
You shouId never
have come back.
Take cover.
Theres nothing more we can do.
Youre our onIy hope.
Redeem the past and heIp us.
I know you can.
Show it to us aII.
HeII just run away, Iike before.
Do your job.
This aint over.
Smart move.
Dont forget
whose side youre on.

We have to fight this war

Move!
We pissed them off
by pushing them back.

started making picture books.
This is not even Russian.
-If its from the Russians -
it must be taken to headquarters.
You know that, Pyykko.
They mustve been in a hurry!
The book is onIy haIf-done.
III take it when I go courting.
There are empty pages in it.
AII pages must be returned.
Even the used ones.
That wouId give them
something to study...
Greetings from home.

Right before his death -
destiny gives the priest
a second chance.
Next opportunity: Arizona 1 887.
The innocent suffered again.
I got even more interested
in the book.
I studied the text,
began to understand.
The priests story was interesting.
He had been fearfuI, brave,
negIigent, even reckIess.
BIindIy doing the right thing.
The priest gave advice
but was never understood.

was approaching us.
Wake up! She is here.

Its a serious offence to

The book is indestructibIe.

A very dangerous saboteur

Dont be fooIed by appearances.
She is beautifuI, but deadIy.
Shes aIready here! She aImost
destroyed The Book of Fate -
but I Iocked her in the cargo hoId.
-Good. But that is not enough.
She must be eIiminated.
You must kiII her.
I can guard her
for the duration of the trip.
Prisons wont stop her.
She has escaped before.
Theres not much time.
You dont understand.
In order to kiII -
I must remove my energy chip
and that wiII be the end of me.
You wiII sacrifice yourseIf

You must do it.
There is no aIternative.
The bIood of the innocent

Danger!

GaIagf is Iying!
Listen! GaIagf wants to

They must not go to eviI hands.

Youve got to trust me.
No one eIse can stop him.
