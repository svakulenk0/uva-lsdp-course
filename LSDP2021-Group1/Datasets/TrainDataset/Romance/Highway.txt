Oh, I don't know.
Something.. - Then, this is the
one that we kept on one side.
I wonder, if he is
that absolutely.. - I mean
absolutely different, you know.
- This is the veil.
With the embroidery..
- Yes, I like it too.
How are you, darling?
Nice to meet you..
- My daughter's mother-in-law.
Go! One, two, three, four..
And turn and go!
Smile, mama.
Smile, mummy.
I think this
will go with this one.
Right..
- Okay, let's ask.
Come on, come on,
I'll get you the reflection.
Like it?
- That's nice.
I think that's beautiful.
- This is yours.
"The bride's anklets
are so pretty.."
"The bride's veil is so pretty."
"The bride's veil is so pretty."
"The bride's earrings
are so pretty."
Right. Do it properly.
Remove all the extra flowers.
Mister, cover them
with flowers.
Okay?
Like I told you earlier.
Bye!
Let's go..
What's the urgency?
We have the rest of our lives.
We've been asked not to meet
for a few days..
Let's go.
I think you should return.
No one has seen us yet.
Vinay, I want to breathe.
Wedding traditions..
Welcome! The costumes,
the jewelry, etcetera..
Please let's get
away for a while.
Just for an hour.
- An hour?
Start the car. - 15 minutes.
- Let's go.
- Let's go.
Thank you.
Five minutes to go.
The time hasn't started yet.
Let's escape
these bright lights.
Out in the open.
To the highway?
- Without bodyguards?
Just a glimpse
of the highway. Okay? Promise.
Veera, you're being..
- Please.. Vinay, please.
Okay.
It's working.
All the knots in my brain
are untying.
Good. Let's head back.
Some untying left.
Little more.
A little longer
has become a lot longer.
So?
Little more.
Veera, it isn't safe here.
You're here.
Vinay..
Let's not go back.
Let's run away.
Very funny.
- Yes! Let's make a run for it.
And build a beautiful home
on some mountain top.
You can be a shepherd.
I can cook.
It'll be great fun.
Okay. I'm turning back.
- Okay.. No!
Sorry, sorry.
- Enough!
No, Vinay, little more.
Vinay, please.
We should've turned back
much earlier.
Is it closed?
Veera.. Veera, sit!
Veera, get back in the car.
See!
The air is so different here.
So fresh.
Veera, come back.
Breathing the city air
makes you restless.
Why can't it be like this?
If you've had your fun,
come back.
Come out for a second!
- Veera, hurry.
Just for one second, Vinay.
Please!
He's coming from behind.
Run!
Hey, you scum!
Stop! Stop, I say!
Stand right there.
- Hurry!
Constable!
- You..
Vinay.
Get in the car.
- Vinay!
I had told you..
I had told you. - Vinay!
Get out! Open the door.
Take the car. Get in!
Don't you dare!
- Get in.
Stay there. Or I'll shoot!
Let's move!
Do you have a vehicle?
Where are you?
Where do we have to go?
Can you see the road
at the back?
Drive along that.
I'll tell you.
Tell me.
- 300.
Take the road
behind the mountain.
No! No..
Let go!
- No!
Let her go.
Open the back door.
Get in there.
Tie her hands.
Your name?
What's your name?
I want to go home. Please..
Name?
- Please..
Please.
- Stop!
Speak up!
Veera
- Veera what?
Tripathi.
Are you done?
Come on.
Manik Tripathi's daughter?
I told you a thousand times.
Stay away from the rich.
Don't mess with them.
They're linked to big shots.
They'll skin you alive
if you mess with them.
Now deal with it.
He didn't know who she is.
Who travels in a flashy Audi?
Tell me.
Tripathi's daughter.
- Yes!
Tripathi's daughter.
The police, the home guard.
BSF, the army..
They'll enter your behind
and exit through your mouth.
Now save your honor.
A man should know his place.
Why climb a mountain
if you don't have the guts?
What are you staring at?
What will you do? Eat me up?
You're scared witless.
Pair of eunuchs!
Bhaati!
You shouldn't have said that.
I won't forget this.
No, I won't, Bhaati.
Or should I fix you right now?
I swear..
Put that away! - Hello.
Easy.
- Don't stop me.
Stay away from the rich.
Fear them!
- Not a word more.
Why should we fear the rich?
Salute them.
Open doors for them. Why?
Because they can take your life
whenever they want.
They've got it all.
What's left?
We're used to licking
their soles.
Enjoy getting harassed now.
You mother..
Let's go.
Sit!
You're talking
about Manik Tripathi.
He owns factories
around the world.
Ministers and politicians are
his mates. Must we take them on?
What will you do?
What now?
Call him up.
Hello, Mr. Tripathi.
You know what? Your daughter
is in our custody.
I am messaging you an address.
Come there with the ransom,
please.
Yes.
That's just what I'll say.
And when the girl gets shot
in the leg
Tripathi will come running
with the cash.
Or I'll sell her off to a
brothel. In some shady street.
Vanished. India is too big.
A bad omen is shadowing him.
He'll land us in trouble too.
You'll die
a dog's death, Bhaati.
A dog always dies
a dog's death.
What'll they do to me?
Hang me four times?
I've murdered three men already.
I'll die as I lived.
But this will happen for sure.
I will do it.
Listen.
Wake up!
I am Gaurav.
Don't be scared.
They call me Goru.
I'll take care of you.
No.
I'll talk to you later.
We have to go now.
It's too risky here.
Get up. Now!
I don't trust
any of you anyway.
So, do what you have to do.
Let's go.
Switch off your phones.
Their woman is in our hands.
Today is our day.
Hail Kishan Das!
- Hail him!
Yes!
Hail Lord Lakkad!
- Hail him!
Yes!
Hail our villages.
- Hail our land!
Hail the Lord!
Any new 'qawali'
out in the market?
Listen.
People don't like listening
to new 'qawali'.
A special recitation.
In honor
of Khwaja Gharib Nawaz.
Is it old?
- Very old.
Then it's fine.
Hello.
- Hello.
Pal, you've outdone yourself!
Your name will spread
far and wide.
Couldn't you talk on the phone?
I heard today.
Tried calling you.
Where will you hide us?
Things have changed.
You're famous now.
Wherever you go with the girl,
all Ajmer Sharif will know
and we'll all become famous.
So, you can't stay here.
Is it on the news?
Not yet.
Everyone knows because
of the damn police.
My God!
You have M.K. Tripathi's
daughter. Imagine!
It's me.
Are you unwell?
Your lips must be numb.
I'm on your side.
Make sure you never talk
to anyone about me.
They're dangerous people.
Who knows
what they'll do to you?
You couldn't even imagine it.
But I am here.
I'll take care of you.
I'll take care of you.
I really will.
You want to go home, don't you?
You want to go home, don't you?
Back to your parents?
To your family?
You want to return, right?
I'll take you back.
You're back.
Let's give her some water.
We'll feed her later.
There's Aadoo.
We're over there. Okay.
- Sit down.
Out. Hey, Aadoo
Hurry up!
Check the corners.
All clear?
- All clear.
Come on.
Sorry! Sorry, please!
Please!
Please..
Please!
I'm sorry! Please..
- What is it?
She wants to run.
- So?
Run!
Well?
Run.
Hey!
"Where are You?"
"Where am I?"
"Where are You? Where am I?"
"Where are You? Where am I?"
"O Lord, show compassion to me."
"Countless sorrows surround me."
"I believe that You will restore
my world."
"Hear the one who has no one."
"Where are You? Where am I?"
"Where are You? Where am I?"
"Where are You? Where am I?"
"Where are You? Where am I?"
"How fearsome
is the path before me!"
"Why have You
turned away from me?"
"Where am I?"
"Where am I?"
"Darkness descends around me."
"No light to be seen."
"Body broken, soul defeated."
"The stars of good fortune
have faded."
"Show a ray of hope."
"There's nothingness
everywhere."
Get back!
She ran away of her own accord.
She'll return in the same way.
Move!
No tea for me?
I'm making cottage cheese curry.
Will you eat it?
We need SIM cards.
Take Tonk with you.
Send the stuff back with him.
We need other stuff too.
- Don't worry.
Excuse me!
Can you hear me?
What is it?
Can I come out
just for a little while?
Why?
Closed spaces
make my head spin.
I'm feeling ill.
Let her out.
- I won't try..
M.K. Tripathi.
- ...and run. Just for a while.
This is such an odd place.
I've never seen
a place like this.
We spend all our time in hotels
on our holidays.
No point travelling.
We may just as well
check into a hotel in Delhi.
Hotels are the same everywhere.
Why am I talking so much?
It feels so unreal.
Like I'm watching a movie.
I have no control. Words
pour out without my knowledge.
Actually, I haven't said a word
for almost two days.
Maybe, that's why. Sorry.
- Hey!
Here.
Anyway, it feels good
sitting out here. So, thank you.
You, come here.
I felt like throwing up inside.
That's why, I said..
Feels better out here.
It's the fresh air..
There's a lot to..
I'm still talking!
What's going on?
I should be tense right now.
I am tensed.
No more talking.
Is the tea good?
- It's different.
It's good. Is there sugar in it
or something else?
Hey! You made the tea.
I added sugar, but maybe
some salt fell in.
There's salt everywhere.
On my face, too.
- Right.
I thought it was only me.
Everyone has got salt on them.
Look at my arm.
Salt here too.
Why did you have
to run away like that?
I told you, I'd make some
arrangement.
Now listen carefully.
Has the salt gone?
No..
You better trust me.
How will it work otherwise?
Here's my plan.
Panicking won't help.
The plan is.. Look.
- No!
I know what
you must be thinking, Mahabir.
Maybe, you misunderstood
the whole thing.
That's possible, right?
I'll tell you what's going on.
You can..
You've it got wrong. Listen!
She's a consignment.
Not a girl.
I am not arguing..
- That's enough!
End of story.
- Okay.
You! Can't you dress decently?
Stop.
- What are you doing?
Let's go.
Are we going now?
- Yes.
Where to?
- No idea.
Will Goru tell everyone?
Shut her mouth!
Tie her hands.
Put her in the truck!
What about the truck papers?
And the state border police?
We need the license plate
registration.
Show these papers. They belong
to a junked old truck. Here.
Well done!
Now, what's the plan?
We talk to Tonk in Ajmer.
- Shall I switch the phone on?
Throw that SIM card away.
We'll call from a landline.
Stop!
Look away!
Where the hell were you?
Where were you?
Have you lost your mind?
How dare you ask?
You can go and relieve yourself.
Don't I have to go, too?
Think about it.
Come on.
What happened?
- Got through?
Yes. Tonk will call her parents
from her phone.
He'll meet us in two days.
Let's go.
I'll sit in the front.
I'll break your bones
if you talk nonsense.
Okay.
Break my bones.
Satisfy yourself.
But I will sit in the front.
No problem.
I'll sit next to her.
She'll be sitting
between us. Okay?
Sorry. I was very rude.
It's strange!
I'm never so rude to anyone.
Never!
I'm usually very well behaved.
I mean, I have good manners.
And with you..
Sorry.
I felt like throwing up..
- Shut up!
I am apologizing.
- Am I apologizing?
Are we here to show off
our good manners?
Show them off
in your father's house.
Hurry up!
Hi, Veera!
How are you?
How am I?
I'll think about it
and let you know.
Up!
What happened, sir?
What's inside?
Nothing, sir.
Nothing?
Driving an empty truck?
Just some household goods.
Or stolen goods from Rajasthan?
I swear on my mother, sir.
Get out!
Get down.
Open the back.
- Sir..
May I talk to you, sir?
- What is it?
We're in a hurry.
- So?
Can we work this out?
Bribing the police?
You little scumbag!
Do you have the means?
- No, sir.
Open up! Move.
Open it!
Open it.
Open up. Right now!
Want a caning?
Quick!
The other one.
Step aside!
You look dishonest.
So, you confused us.
Get going!
Are you offended?
Should I confiscate it?
No, sir.
Let them go.
What.. What happened?
Were you hiding?
Did you hide?
Yes.
Why?
This was your chance.
Why did you hide?
I don't know.
What do you mean?
That's what!
I don't know!
Maybe, I've lost my mind.
I could've escaped so easily.
What's wrong with me?
What's going on?
Eat quickly if you want to eat.
We'll not stop
for a long time now.
I was nine years old.
At home..
He used to bring
imported chocolates for me.
My uncle.
He made me sit on his lap
and loved me.
And then alone..
In the bathroom
he would make me
sit on his lap again
and love me.
I used to scream.
But he'd cover my mouth..
Like this.
Cover my mouth
so that my screams
could not come out.
It hurt so much.
It's all over.
We're done.
My doll.
You are the best girl
in the whole world.
"The most beautiful.."
He came home again.
Again and again.
Inside, I was screaming
my lungs out.
Don't tell anyone. Okay?
One day, I told mummy.
I explained to her.
Mummy said
Don't tell anyone.
Okay?
I didn't tell anyone.
Then one day, it all stopped.
But he still visited.
With chocolates for me.
He comes to the house
even now.
I sit on his lap.
He loves me.
I smile.
My doll.
The most beautiful of all..
The beasts!
Manners. Culture.
Greet them
touch their feet in respect.
They're all around you.
You have to survive among them
laugh with them
befriend them
love them.
The place you've got me from..
I don't want to go back there.
The place we're going to..
I don't want to get there.
But this road..
It's very good.
I want this road to never end.
Hello. Get in touch
with ACP Chaudhary.
Ask him to report to my office
urgently.
The case was filed at Dera Mandi
Police Station. - Sir.
All the details are in the file.
- Thank you, Vikram.
Thanks for everything.
This cannot go public.
The special cell is handling
the case.
Information will be shared
with caution.
His name is Mahabir Bhaati.
He's on the run.
They're not professional
kidnappers
just petty criminals.
Kids, run! - Land grabbing,
armed robbery, etcetera.
Call from the girl's phone.
Then remove the battery.
A call from Veera's phone.
- Take it.
First let's find out
if you're worth trusting.
I'll call later.
The call's from Noida.
Near Delhi border.
DL registration.
Show us the papers.
I came of my own accord
to tell you.
Why would I lie now?
I have no clue
where Mahabir has taken her.
I've come from so far
to tell you everything.
I'll tell you everything.
Hiding information
is out of the question.
Just ask!
They left this place a week ago.
They could be anywhere.
I'll tell you when to hand over
the ransom money.
Just relax. And wait.
I'll let you know.
He called from Calcutta.
"The girl dances
and ensnares me.."
Move the barricade.
Let them pass.
Check the papers.
- Stop..
Get back.
- You have already checked..
They have nabbed a person
there. - In Shyambazaar..
Move from here.
Come out.
- Check the car.
Where are you coming from?
- Next state.
Let a few pass.
- Show the papers.
God knows where she is.
What they're doing to her.
"A bite of sweet betel quid."
"A cotton Lahori suit."
"In high spirits,
the firefly soars.."
"The Lord is your gardener,
O green forest."
"Never mind the cuss words,
He watches your every step."
"Ignore what the world thinks."
"Take the name of God.
Take the name of Ali.."
"Take the name of God.
Take the name of Ali.."
"She has taken the path to Him."
"She has taken the path to Him."
"Ali.."
"Travelling on and on.."
"Ali.. On your path,
she walks. Ali.."
"On your path, she walks."
"Firefly, free spirit,
firecracker."
"Flying about intoxicated"
"all around. Free spirit,
firecracker."
"Flying about intoxicated"
"all around."
"The Lord is your gardener,
O green forest."
"Never mind the cuss words,
He watches your every step."
"Ignore what the world thinks."
"Take the name of God.
Take the name of Ali.."
"Take the name of God.
Take the name of Ali.."
"Throwing caution to the wind,
I am in Your hands."
"Throwing caution to the wind,
I am in Your hands."
"Throwing caution to the wind,
I am in Your hands."
"Throwing caution to the wind,
I am in Your hands."
"God's chosen one,
His most dear one.."
"God will take away
the suffering He inflicts."
"Take His name and dance.."
"Ali.. Take His name
and dance.."
"Ali.."
"Take the name of God.
Take the name of Ali.."
"Take the name of God.
Take the name of Ali.."
"Growing wild like the fig tree,
worshipped by all."
"No one plants her.
No one can cage her."
"On this endless journey,
like rainwater falling"
"soiled if she
touches the ground."
"Just chant the name of Lord.
Give yourself up to Him."
"Just chant the name of Lord.
He is everywhere."
"Just chant the name of Lord.
Give yourself up to Him."
"Just chant the name of Lord.
He is everywhere. Lord.."
"Lord.."

I am in Your hands."
"Throwing caution to the wind,
I am in Your hands."
"Throwing caution to the wind,
I am in Your hands.."
"Throwing caution to the wind,
I am in Your hands."
Wow!
Great!
There are such
unique places in this country.
Tell me.
Why are the rich fascinated
by dirty, run-down, old ruins?
Step to the side.
Step forward.
Hold this.
Hold it straight. We need
to show the date.
What language is it?
- Bengali.
So that they think
we're in Bengal. Smart!
You've been abducted.
Look upset.
Who'd pay ransom for you?
Stop laughing.
Be serious.
How can I be serious,
looking at you?
Aadoo!
Okay. I'll turn around.
Higher.
This place is good.
The market is nearby.
Better buy her clothes.
She'll stand out like this.
Everything will be okay.
But I'd like to know..
If anything goes wrong..
The ransom, the calls.
By the way, are we still..
Sticking to our plan?
Why?
Just asking.
We're selling the girl
to a brothel.
Okay.
- Don't get fond of her.
Nothing like that.
Is she the only respectable one?
What about the poor girls?
Women are taken away at night.
For some big shot
from the city.
A woman is required tonight.
And who takes her to him?
Let it be..
- Her own husband!
Her man.
He sits outside while his wife
is inside with the big shot.
Then the door opens
and he brings his wife
back home.
And he takes out all his
frustrations on the woman.
Because the rich can exploit us
whenever they feel like.
To hell with them!
To hell with them!
Drop it.
He's not in the mood.
I'll fix his mood.
Are you mad?
Never do that.
Got it.
What is it?
You asked him to buy
clothes for me.
Aadoo told me.
Stop acting. I look very nice.
What is this song?
Well?
- Why do you want to know?
I want to hear the song.
That's it.
Go now.
Mahabir Bhaati.
Where did you hear it?
- Why should I tell you?
Now, I have to know.
What song was that?
It's not a song.
Then?
So where did you hear it?
My mother used to sing it.
Really?
Wow!
For you?
Tell me. Please! - Yes,
she used to sing it for me.
When she went to work,
I went with her.
I'd cry, so she'd sing. Okay?
You used to cry!
Does your mother live with you?
Enough. Go inside!
Stand up!
You see,
I don't feel like going.
Too smart!
- Right!
I'm not scared anymore.
Don't get offended, but..
I find you really cute now.
So, what made you cry?
Tell me.
Who troubled the little one?
Sorry! I won't ask again.
Listen..
"Sleep now."
"Do not cry."
Look down!
Where's your mind?
You burnt the food.
"My adored son, sleep now."
"Your dreams will carry you"
"to a field
of sweet delights."
"The parrot on the tree"
"tells you"
"to smile."
"The swan wants
to befriend you."
"My adored son."
"My adored son."
"The night is as dark as coal."
"Your eyes fill with sleep."
"With a blanket of stars
covering you."
"Sleep a sweet sleep."
"The night is as dark as coal."
"Your eyes fill with sleep."
"With a blanket of stars
covering you."
"Sleep a sweet sleep."
"If you toss and turn"
"the mynah bird
will steal you away."
"A falling star,
a little star."
"A falling star."
"It asks after you."
"Why don't you sleep?
Why do you cry?"
"Why did you get so lost?"
"What upset you?
Who upset you?"
"What did you leave behind
in the land you came from?"
Your mother..
What do you call her?
Mom.
So..
Is she well?
I mean..
Is she all right?
You have to promise me,
Mahabir.
Once we're done with all this
you'll see her.
Where is she?
In the village.
So, you'll go to the village
and see her.
Okay?
Promise?
"Tell me what is in your heart."
"Share your thoughts with me."
"The parrot on the tree"
"tells you"
"to smile."
"The swan wants
to befriend you."
"Sleep now, my adored son."
"Sleep now, my adored son."
"Sleep now, my adored son."
"Sleep now, my adored son."
It's in English, right?
- Totally in English, sir.
This one.
"Let me dominate you.."
"Dominate your body.
Terminate this naughty."
"Let me dominate your..
Dominate your body."
"Terminate this naughty."
"I am a hot Tamale.
Red Chille me, finale."
"Fire like Bob Marley.
Do you wanna mash up, mash up."
"I am a hot Tamale.
Red chille me, finale."
"Fire like Bob Marley.
Do you wanna mash up, mash up."
"Shout it out loud."
"Something about these streets.
The way my mind's on a spree."
"As I listen to this beat."
"listen, listen to this beat..
I got a feeling so real."
"Do you see what I see?
The way you make me feel."
"Makes my heart beat a mill.
This is the real deal"
"it's like the type of thrill
that I wanna be about."
"Wanna wanna be about.
Wanna shout it out loud."
"Shout it,
shout it out loud."
"I am a hot Tamale.
Red chille me, finale."
"Fire like Bob Marley.
Do you wanna mash up, mash up."
"I am a hot Tamale.
Red chille me, finale."
"Fire like Bob Marley.
Do you wanna mash up, mash up."
"Boy."
"You try to chain me,
slave me."
"Hate me, flame me..
Oh, you know you can't tame me."
"Boom like Bob Marley,
my swag is so gnarly."
"You be so dizzy izzy. Mash up
the beat, we'd be getting busy."
"Wake up in it,
now mash up with it."
"Walk up in it,
gotta get it, get it."
"I am a hot Tamale.
Red Chille me, finale."
"Fire like Bob Marley.
Do you wanna.."
Come.
Take your stuff.
Chandigarh bus station?
I'm proud of you. Okay, bye.
Are you leaving?
- Yes. I have to.
Take care of yourself.
We'll meet again.
Let's go.
Look there.
A police station. Go inside
and talk to the man in charge.
Tell him your name
and your father's name.
Say that you're
the kidnapped girl.
You know that I won't go.
Take your phone.
Call your home first.
Can't you hear me?
I won't go.
You won't go? So what
will you do with me?
Marry me?
Raise my kids?
What will you do?
What's come over you?
Why create a scene?
What will you do with me?
Well?
You know who I am.
That's just it.
I know who you really are.
I killed three people.
I have..
With these very hands.
My life is over.
It'll never get fixed.
Never.
I will only die.
You should go back.
Go back to Delhi.
How will I, Mahabir?
Look. I'm telling you to go.
It'll be a disaster. Go away!
What's your story?
How did this happen?
- Shut up!
Go to the police station.
I won't go. What will you do?
What the hell! Let go!
Mahabir, let me go!
Quietly, come along.
Are you that strong?
I won't go.
Don't drive me crazy.
I won't go.
Kill me too!
Stop, Mahabir.
Don't be childish.
Are you crazy?
What's wrong?
Hello!
One minute.
I have to make a call.
Hey!
- Hello..
Get up!
Where do I catch the bus
to Chandigarh?
Reckong Peo bus stand.
- Reckong Peo.
Reckong Peo bus stand?
- Get in.
Shimla..
Get this straight.
Whatever happens, you don't
decide alone. Got it?
Move away. Stand there,
near the bench.
"I was bound to come this way."
"My path is somewhere here."
"I stand at the crossroads."
"The journey opens
its arms to me."
"Where am I?"
"Where am I?"
"Where am I?"
"Sighs, fear,
happiness, paths.."
"Brittle words,
true relations.."
"Among all these"
"where am I?"
A 20 minute stop. Be quick!
There's no plan
of raising kids
or marrying.
There's no plan.
All I want is a little more.
A little longer with you.
I never felt like this before.
The way I feel with you..
I can do anything.
Anything I feel like.
And you'll handle it.
I don't even have to think.
I've never felt like this.
But I'm being very selfish.
You'll be in trouble.
They thought
we were in Calcutta.
Now they'll know
that we're here.
Nothing can save us now, right?
Oh no! All ruined!
What now?
Let's sit on top.
What?
- On the roof.
Coming?
Let's decide the next move..
- You talk too much.
Come on.
"Wrapped in clouds
of white wool"
"I am like the winter breeze."
"Not caring what's left behind."
"Not seeing what lies ahead."
"I ask myself.."
"Where am I?"
"Where am I?"
"Where am I, now?"
"Where am I?"
"Where am I, now?"
"Finding myself
amidst lost desires.."
"Firm desires, shaky pursuits."
"In all of this"
"where"
"am I?"
What are you staring at?
You like the mountains
or the sea?
I've never seen the sea.
I like the mountains more, too.
Like that one.
It is calling out to me.
I wish we could go there.
Then come along.
We'll go there!
Got other plans?
Okay. Let's go.
Please! For one second.
Are you done? Give it back.
Enough. Give it here.
It has power, boss.
Hands up!
- I'll give you a tight slap.
It's not a toy. Give it to me.
Tell me something.
One bullet and a man
is finished, right?
Two are finished.
The one who gets shot
and the one who shoots.
It's a bad thing.
Give it to me.
So why don't you throw it away?
Why keep it?
What the hell do you know?
I can see.
We won't fight.
No fighting.
Don't say such things.
Again?
Okay, sorry!
Let's go.
Let's race.
Ready, steady, go!
I wanted a home
on a mountain like this.
Always wanted one.
My home.
My dream.
Pick any mountain you like.
They're all ours.
Really?
Yes, they belong to us.
They'll be here whenever
you come back.
I'm choosing one.
- Sure, go ahead.
I don't know why I'm..
Keep this.
- No..
This is my dream home.
Exactly how I want it.
We're saved so much work.
Okay?
- Okay.
Be comfortable. The owners
won't be back soon.
Hungry? Okay.
- Yes.
Ten minutes.
I'll make something.
Freshen up and just relax.
Leave it. I'll do it.
No. This is my home
Now out!
Who's denying it?
- Out.
Let me clean up.
- Out.
Come on in!
What is it?
- One minute.
No..
- No way.
This can never be mine.
I've come so far away.
No, Mahabir.
Everything will be all right.
Mom!
Everything is over.
I was once my mother's
adored son.
Mom..
Mahabir..
Mahabir, where's your gun?
Where's your gun?
I threw it away.
- Veera Tripathi?
Stay away!
Back off!
Get back!
It's all right.
- Veera Tripathi?
What did you shoot?
Rascal! Why shoot?
What was he doing?
Veera, listen.
- Move back.
I'll kill everyone.. - Veera,
he needs to be hospitalized.
Veera, there's no time.
He'll die. He needs
to be hospitalized.
Nothing will happen to him.
We have to take him immediately.
Please! - Mahabir..
Let's go. Mahabir..
Help him. - Stretcher.
Listen to me. I'll take you
to your village.
Okay? Promise!
To your mom.
I said everything will be okay.
Didn't I?
Nothing has gone wrong.
I am telling you.
Nothing has changed.
See for yourself.
Veera.
I know what you're thinking.
But you know nothing.
Okay. Anyway..
The important thing is
that we save Mahabir.
Papa, please. We need
to save Mahabir.
He kidnapped me.
But it's not what it seems.
Quite the opposite. - What..
What's happened, child?
Nothing has happened.
I am fine.
- Veera.
Who is this man?
Who is this man?
I am fine.
- Sit down.
Let go.
- Easy! Gently.
Papa, please!
- Calm down.
What's that for? This injection?
Papa, listen to me. Please.
You don't understand.
Okay. Wait. One second.
Here's what.
There's something
I want to tell you.
Stop.
Quiet.
Why don't you understand?
What have you done?
You don't get it! - Veera..
Sleep! You're exhausted.
You have to sleep. Okay?
Sleep. Sleep..
- No..
He died on the spot.
At around 9.30.
Before we could get him
on the stretcher, he died.
I see. - Can we take Veera
back to Delhi?
Sure.
- Thank you.
Where's the body?
- In the mortuary.
The post-mortem?
- Done, sir.
Mahabir Bhaati.
- Right, sir.
Navita, come here.
I'll prepare the injection.
Vinay's mom wants to see you.
Be nice to her. Okay?
Be pleasant.
Like everything was normal.
What do you think, Veera?
In which city should we have
the wedding?
M.K. was saying New York.
Convenient for everyone.
Guess what, Veera.
We're engaged.
You know, the other day,
I came back home from work
and he had done up
my entire room with flowers,
candles.. - She's not interested
in the story.
- Of course, she is.
Every winter they say
it's so cold.
Every summer that say
that it's too warm.
Absolutely.
- Why is it such a surprise?
Every year..
- What happened?
Why are you coming down?
Where is the nurse?
- Let her come.
Come on, dear.
Slowly. Careful.
Come in.
Good.
So, how are you
feeling now?
Better.
And you?
We're fine.
Just worried about you.
Hope you'll get better soon.
She looks much better.
Hi, Vinay.
- Hi, Veera.
I found my home on a mountain.
Really?
I cooked food.
I cleaned my house too.
Then the bullet was fired.
Vinay loves the mountains,
right?
That Austrian resort? You know
Veera's favorite.. - The ski..
The ski resort.
- I always said
that I would run away.
I don't want
to live in the city.
Doesn't everyone say that?
But who runs away?
I wouldn't have either
if Mahabir hadn't kidnapped me
and taken me away.
But now..
I'm gone.
I cannot come back.
Veera, I think you should rest.
We'll talk later.
It's so strange.
I was kidnapped
but I was free there.
I'm in prison here.
Hey.. Anyway.
Pratima.
- Come on, Veera.
Is this my home?
- Come!
No chocolates today,
Mr. Shukla?
I'll order some now.
Where?
Where will you give them to me?
Here? Or in the bathroom?
Quiet.
Enough of this.
Yes, mummy? Is there
something you want to say?
Stupid. I don't know
what she's talking about.
Can't you remember?
Let me remind you.
My princess.
You're the most beautiful girl
in the world. My doll.
Remember?
With your hands
how you'd cover my mouth
so that my screams
could not be heard.
Well?
All my screams..
My cries of pain..
To keep my screams silent
you forced my mouth shut. Hush!
Control her!
Priya. Hold her, please.
- In the bathroom..
Again and again.
- Veera.
The running tap..
Where were you, nurse?
Take her away.
- She has really gone crazy.
They are right.
I used to scream. I was nine!
That hand was over my mouth.
My cries were silenced.
No one heard me.
Mad! She has gone mad.
Ask her to shut up, Manu.
Ask her to shut..
- Shut up!
Yes. It happens.
These things happen
all the time.
So you know what?
I'm not okay with it.
This world
where this happens..
Where you can't tell a lie
from the truth.
Everything is mixed up.
There's so much confusion.
Veera. Baby..
Okay. Let's be sensible.
- No!
I will not be sensible.
I'm stupid. I'll remain stupid.
Relax.
Sensible?
Veera, be careful
when you go out.
Strangers are bad.
A girl should always be careful.
Why didn't you ever say
that I should be careful
inside the house too?
That I should also protect
myself from you.
Why didn't you ever tell me?
I was so exposed here.
Inside my own house.
So, I don't want to be sensible.
I am foolish. I'm bad.
But I am not one of you.
I will not come back.
