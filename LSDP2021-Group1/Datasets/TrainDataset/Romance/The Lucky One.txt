LOGAN: You know, the smallest thing
can change your life.
In the blink of an eye, something happens
by chance, when you least expect it...
...sets you on a course
that you never planned...
...into a future you never imagined.
Where will it take you?
That's the journey of our lives.
Our search for the light.
But sometimes...
...finding the light means you must pass
through the deepest darkness.
At least, that's how it was for me.
Security team's ready to go.
Move them.
Ready? Move.
Ready? Go.
Don't move!
SOLDIER 1: Three civilians!
LOGAN: Check them!
LOGAN:
Woman and child!
SOLDIER 2:
Stay left! Coming through!
Three children, three children!
SOLDIER 3:
I'm chasing one to my left!
VICTOR:
Go.
VICTOR:
Shit.
SOLDIER 4:
Over here.
- Castro!
CASTRO: Right here.
Bumping heads with third platoon.
Get on the horn.
CASTRO: I'm on it, Aces.
- "Aces"?
You guys came...
I got a man down. Need Doc Sanders.
First floor corridor.
Secure the hallway!
Move!
Move, move, move!
Talk to me, Castro. It's Aces.
We're gonna get you out of here.
Roger. About 20 mikes. Helo is inbound.
Let's move out.
VICTOR:
Now just sit.
Mortar. Right where you were sitting.
Three other guys didn't make it.
The corpsman found this
in your SAW pouch.
I saw you pick it up.
Looks like it saved you.
Got yourself a guardian angel.
She's not mine.
- Do you know whose picture that is?
- No idea.
- You know whose picture this is?
- No.
- No. Sorry.
- No?
No, I don't think so.
We're the wasted generation
I'm telling you, man, you gotta set eyes
on that girl one day.
You got to thank her.
No question. She's the reason
you're still breathing.
Give her a kiss for me too.
I'm only alive because I followed
your crazy ass.
LOGAN: We just got a couple breaks is all,
man. No big deal.
Bullshit.
Things like this don't just happen.
She's got you out of this mess.
We're going home.
God, you're full of shit, Victor.
I say you owe her. Big time.
BOY: You're doing good.
Now look at my shot.
LOGAN:
Zeus!
Buddy, hey. Come here.
How you doing? Hi.
How you doing? Hey, buddy.
They look after you?
Go on, ask her.
So, Mom, when do I get my room back?
Honey, let's make Uncle Logan
feel welcome.
BOYS:
Mom.
SISTER:
Go outside and play.
- Come on, we were just about to win.
- Go outside now.
- Yes, ma'am.
- Oh, fine.
SISTER: Are you okay?
- Yeah.
He's gonna make it on YouTube.
Time to wake up!
Mom! Mom!
Hey, sorry. Tim. Sorry.
You know, the Corps
can get you some help.
LOGAN: Why did I make it out
when so many guys didn't?
But I feel like there's this debt
that I have to pay.
I don't know where I belong.
I guess I should figure that out.
Um...
I know there's no easy answer, sis...
...but maybe all I need is time.
LOGAN:
Any chance you recognize that girl?
No, I'm sorry. Not in the boat region.
Good luck.
Thank you.
BARTENDER: Hey, Roger?
Guy wants to know who this girl is.
ROGER:
Beth Green.
Runs the pet motel
just outside of town there.
- Do you know her?
- Ha-ha.
Girl can't look like that in a town like this
and not be known.
Used to be married to a buddy of mine.
What's it to you, anyway?
Oh, I just owe her thanks is all.
LOGAN:
Hello?
WOMAN:
Hello.
Can I help you?
What a beautiful Shepherd.
What's his name?
Zeus.
- Oh, he's a sweetheart.
- He's good with people.
Well, better than I am.
BETH: Well, at least you don't introduce
yourself to the animals before their owners.
- I'm Beth.
- Logan.
Um... So I, uh, came here...
Excuse me for a second.
Hello?
Oh, hi, Mrs. Jackson.
Come on.
I was just about to call you to confirm...
...that Selby is coming in today at 2
and he's gonna be with us for a week.
Great. Excellent.
No. No, Kevin doesn't
work here anymore.
Okay, see you then. Bye.
It's Beth.
Yes, we do train. We're full service.
I'm so sorry.
Just bring in Napoleon's papers and any
dietary restrictions that he might have.
- Monday is great. Bye.
ELLIE: Oscar, get up here.
Well, Zeus is way too well behaved
to need training...
...so I'm guessing that you're here
to board him?
No, I'm not going anywhere.
I just got off the road yesterday.
Where from?
Colorado.
And what brings you to Hamden?
It's kind of a long story. Actually,
I don't really know where to begin.
Oh, gosh. I'm so sorry. That's absolutely
none of my business. Um...
What can I do for you, Logan?
I'm really here
because I came to see you.
You see, I found this.
Oh. It was just...
Oh, you saw the ad. Of course.
Okay. So the job doesn't... It doesn't pay
much. Um, mostly you'll just be walking...
...feeding, cleaning cages.
It's six days a week.
Zeus is welcome anytime.
And help, Logan. That's the job.
We just need some help.
ELLIE:
Oscar. Get up here.
Up.
Come on.
Can I borrow your pen?
So besides Zeus, do you have any
experience with working with dogs?
I worked with some bomb dogs.
- Oh. So you were a cop...
- A Marine.
You know what?
You don't need to finish filling that out.
Just leave me a number where I can
reach you and I will call and let you know.
Sounds like you're having trouble
finding someone for the job.
Why does a person drive from Colorado
to Louisiana to work in a dog kennel?
I couldn't tell you. I walked.
You walked?
You walked here from Colorado?
I like to walk.
Would you excuse me for a minute,
please?
You are such a stubborn boy.
Get up here.
Come on. You can do this.
There's a good... Unh!
- Did you take your medication?
- Oh.
I'm still pumping on all cylinders.
That's all that matters, so...
What is it?
There's a man here who came to apply
for the job and I can't get rid of him.
He looks harmless.
BETH: He walked here from Colorado.
- Oh?
Tell him you hired somebody else
or something.
Why do I have to tell him?
You're the one that doesn't want him.
Do you want to hire a crazy person?
Are you crazy?
I beg your pardon, ma'am?
My granddaughter thinks
you might be.
No, ma'am.
Yeah, well, you look like a sharp,
capable young man.
You tell me why there's a sharp, capable
young man wanting a job cleaning cages.
Because it seems like peaceful work.
My last job wasn't.
Oh, where were you? Wall Street?
No, ma'am. I was in the Marine Corps.
Ah. Marine Corps.
LOGAN:
Hey. Down.
- Train him yourself?
- Yes, ma'am.
Hmm. You're a good boy.
How'd you get him to leave?
- I gave him the job.
- You what?
Well, we gotta hire somebody.
You don't know anything about him.
Neither do you.
MAN:
Just needs a little tender loving care.
I'll take it.
MAN: I got tools and lumber and the like.
You're welcome to them.
LOGAN:
Thanks.
BETH:
Come on.
You know, you don't need
to be here until 7:30.
I couldn't sleep.
Figured I'd get an early start.
ELLIE:
Well, we had a whale of a storm.
That lovely thing came down.
That's where we store everything
up there.
- Teslin. Here's your new boss.
LOGAN: Hey, boy. Hey, boy.
BETH: You ready to go?
- Who's that?
That's just somebody that Nana hired.
- Aren't you forgetting something?
- Oh.
BETH: Come on, baby,
we don't want to be late.
Dad doesn't like it
when I practice in the house.
BETH: So maybe you can practice
on the porch.
ELLIE: The little one.
LOGAN: Hey. How you doing?
BETH: I put Duckie in your backpack
for tonight.
BETH:
What's he doing?
Can you believe that he got
that old thing going?
Oh, good Lord.
You know, I'm substituting
for Julie next week.
It's only a couple days, but...
Why don't you go back full-time?
It's been almost a year.
I know how long it's been.
Do you think that he has an off switch?
I hope not. Ha-ha-ha.
Can I help you?
The hell you doing around here?
Is there a problem, officer?
There will be, you don't answer
my questions when I ask them.
I work here.
Put your hands on that bench. Ahem.
Why?
Boy, you wanna do this at the station?
A soldier boy?
"Sergeant Logan Thigh-bolt."
It's Thibault.
- And I'm a Marine.
- Mm-hm.
Well, where's everyone at, Thigh-bolt?
They're all out. Do you want me
to give Beth a message?
Oh-ho.
So it's Beth, is it?
You just tell Beth I'll see her at 4.
You should come.
You never know, you might have fun.
You've always loved their house.
- Save your breath. I'm not going.
- Why not?
ELLIE: You know I can't stand Judge Clayton
and his fundraising extravaganzas.
Mom, check it out.
Hey. Oh, that looks great, sweets.
You look very handsome.
- Hey, Dad.
- Ah!
Hey, wait. What in the world
is this mess here, now, huh?
We gotta teach you how to tie
a proper tie, boy.
Whoo-wee.
I love you in that dress, huh?
Makes me wish I never would have
signed those papers.
Tell me about your new boyfriend.
BETH: What?
- Soldier boy, huh?
BETH: Don't ask me about him.
I didn't hire him.
- He has nothing to do with me.
- Okay. Okay.
KEITH:
Hey, Mama.
Place is looking great.
CHARLOTTE: You look beautiful.
BETH: Thank you.
Thank you so much for coming.
Really good to see you. Here you go.
We've got the governor in our camp.
I just heard.
Benny. Wait a second,
where's my grandson?
- There he is.
- Come here, Benny.
How you doing, sweetie?
He's fighting the good fight
for Hamden's future.
- Tell your mama how we gonna win.
BEN: Vote Clayton.
All right, and?
- The name you trust.
JUDGE: And you know.
- The name you know.
- Yep.
- The judge you trust, the mayor we need.
- Ha, ha, ha. This kid is sharp as a tack.
He's gonna do great things.
You mark my word.
- Where did you dig up that jacket?
- Oh.
Oh, come on.
It's just a garden party, Daddy.
It's not just a garden party.
MAN: How you doing, judge?
- How are you?
- Good to see y'all. Thank you so much.
WOMAN: Nice to see you.
BETH:
Come on, Dexter, go get it.
Go. Yeah.
Yes. Whoo! Oh.
That's it, boy, get it, get it.
Pick it up. Come on.
Oh! Whoa!
BETH: That man is so irritating.
Every time I turn around he's just...
- Uh, uh, uh.
- Good morning.
ELLIE:
Mm.
So you were saying?
LOGAN: We moved around a lot, so I kind of
grew up everywhere, and nowhere.
ELLIE: Oh, that must have been hard, huh?
Changing schools, leaving friends.
LOGAN: It was okay. It was all I knew.
- Mm. But you went to college?
Yes, ma'am. Just for a year.
What'd you study?
He didn't study much
if it was just for a year.
ELLIE:
Elizabeth Green.
- I liked philosophy.
ELLIE: Really?
Yeah, I like to read.
Give us a quote of your
favorite philosopher.
"Sometimes the questions are complicated
and the answers are simple."
ELLIE: Hmm.
- Don't tell me.
Voltaire?
It's Voltaire, isn't it?
It's Dr. Seuss.
Thank you very much the tea, Mrs. Green.
I should get back to work.
Will you call me "Ellie,"
for goodness sake?
Voltaire.
BETH:
What sound does a tiger make?
"This lazy ladybug
didn't know how to fly."
I wanna turn the page.
You can turn the page next.
"One day the lazy ladybug wanted
to sleep somewhere else."
Oh, this looks great, you guys.
Ah. That's beautiful.
Julie's not coming back
after she has the baby.
We'd really like to have you
back full-time.
I can't right now, Rhonda. I'm sorry.
A violin?
A violin? Only girls play violins. Don't you
play, like, basketball or something?
BOY 1: Oh, fine.
The girl wants back his violin.
BOY 2:
It's his mom. Let's go. Let's go.
Hey.
You okay?
LOGAN:
Not bad.
BEN:
I didn't think anyone was listening.
Glad I was.
BETH:
That's perfect.
LOGAN: Here she is.
- Hi.
LOGAN:
Oh, she's happy to see you.
WOMAN: How'd she do?
LOGAN: She was great.
- Make sure you bring her back soon. Cool.
WOMAN: Thank you.
ELLIE:
Logan. Can you drive?
Beth's out with a friend and my ride
to choir practice just fell through.
My bossy granddaughter
won't let me drive since I...
Well, you can hardly even call it a stroke.
It's more like a tap, really. Heh.
- Hasn't slowed me down in the slightest.
- I can see that, ma'am.
- How old are you, dear?
- Twenty-five.
How many tours?
Three.
My grandson never finished his second.
Yeah. You would've liked him.
You two, you were cut
of the same cloth.
You know, you live long enough,
Logan, you lose enough people...
...you learn to appreciate
the memories you have.
Stop begrudging the ones
you never got to make.
Beth hasn't lived as long as I have.
She isn't as bad as she seems.
She doesn't seem so bad to me.
LOGAN:
Hello?
BETH:
All right, thank you. I'll see you later.
BETH:
Yeah. Whoo!
Yes. Here we go.
Whoo! Ha-ha.
BEN: Yahoo.
- Ha-ha-ha.
Come, come, come.
Oh, thank you, honey.
Good job. That's it.
Night, all.
Do you like jambalaya?
No. Ben. Ben, I'm sure that Logan
already has plans.
Do you?
I can't remember the last time
I had a plan.
All right, man. You got dance moves?
- Yeah.
- Yeah? Yeah, what you got? Whoo-hoo.
BEN:
Mom ran track. She was super-fast.
BETH:
Cross-country, I wasn't that good.
Is that why you got a scholarship
to Tulane?
Because you weren't any good?
Okay. Once upon a time
I was pretty good.
Are you happy?
LOGAN:
You went to Tulane?
No, State to be close to home.
Had some personal stuff come up.
She got pregnant. With me.
BETH:
Well, thank you, Benjamin.
Isn't it your night for the dishes?
Thank you.
LOGAN:
Do you still run competitively?
Oh, no, no, no. Now I just do it to clear my
head. It's a lot cheaper than therapy, so...
So is walking.
- Who plays chess?
- Me.
Me too.
Bet I can beat you.
- What's the bet?
- Dishes tonight.
Dishes tonight,
against the pooper scooper tomorrow.
Gotta warn you, I'm not bad.
Check.
Let's do a flip.
Oh, that was cool.
Wheelie.
Somersault.
Checkmate.
Detergent is under the sink.
LOGAN:
What? Did I just get hustled?
Have to admit,
I played better the second time.
BEN:
Sure. Until your second move.
You have any other secret talents
I should know about?
You're the one with the secret.
I saw him playing the piano.
Really?
Yeah.
I saw it when I put the keys back.
He's really good.
Hey, you're not too bad yourself.
- Why don't you play something for us?
- How about a magic trick instead?
Yeah, okay.
He hates playing for people.
He doesn't think that he's good enough.
Hmm.
Ordinary deck.
Wow, okay, cool.
- Oh. It's all right.
- Ha-ha.
Show me again.
- Tell me when to stop.
- Stop.
Memorize the card,
and I am not looking.
Okay, I got it.
Let me give it a little magic.
LOGAN:
Wow.
- I didn't know you were a magician too.
- Wait till you see this one.
Ben, sweetie, it's past your bedtime.
- Wait, this is the best one.
- Show me tomorrow.
Ben, say good night to Logan, now.
- Come on.
- No. I just wanted to show him a trick.
I'm sorry. He's not usually...
It's fine. It's fine.
My brother taught him a few tricks.
Magic was kind of their thing.
We lost him last year.
He was a Marine too.
It's been hard on Ben.
It's been hard on all of us.
ELLIE:
Thank you.
GROUP & ELLIE :
We share
Well, I'm glad you came.
ELLIE:
Oh!
- Ho-ho. Whoo! Ha-ha.
BETH: Oh...
Aren't you helpful, dear, and chivalrous?
You are so...?
Isn't he chivalrous?
Have you been drinking?
I had a little something
called a Moscow Mule.
It sounds terrible, but it was so good.
- I'll make you a cup of tea.
- Oh, good.
Okay.
Look, there's something that
I've been meaning to tell you.
I never fully explained how...
And I'm sorry,
I can't find the right words.
It's all right.
Another time, maybe.
After all, I'm not going anywhere.
Okay.
Good night, Logan.
No. No!
Jesus!
No!
LOGAN:
Beth! Beth!
No! Stop it!
No.
LOGAN:
It's okay.
It's okay.
BETH:
At first they wouldn't tell us anything.
Just that friendly fire was a possibility.
So it's a year ago today...
...and the official investigation
into the death of Sergeant...
...Drake...
...Green...
...is still ongoing.
That's the worst part. Not knowing.
I would give anything...
I would give anything to know
that he didn't die for nothing.
We were inseparable as kids, you know?
We did everything together.
We even built that wall together.
Well, Drake built the wall...
...and I supervised...
...which consisted mostly of drinking
iced teas and reading the Brontës.
Oh. This one day...
...I couldn't find my book anywhere.
So I asked him about it.
And he just pointed.
Look. Look.
God, I was so mad.
I was so mad at him.
And he just laughed.
It was...
BETH:
I'm sorry.
LOGAN:
It's okay.
You got a great laugh, you know that?
I wish I could hear it more.
Why don't you try telling me a joke?
Because you're gonna have to get a few
beers in me before I start telling you jokes.
Okay.
- Okay.
- Okay.
"...Except for Ron and Hermione's slow,
deep breathing.
Harry glanced over at the dark shapes
they made on the floor beside him.
Ron had had a fit of..."
Mom.
- Mom.
- Yes. "On the sofa. Hermione's..."
"...So that her silotee..."
Silhouette.
Come on, Brutus. Hi, buddy.
All right. Come on.
Come on, come on, come on.
Ha-ha. Oh, come on. What...?
Shake.
Wa-yaah!
What's the black dog tag for?
This one's mine, and the black one is
in memory of my best buddy, Victor.
So they're like friendship bracelets.
Yeah. Yeah, you could say that.
No... Oh, man, he's toast.
- Your turn.
- Don't. No.
LOGAN:
Where you going?
Hey. You can run, man,
I'm gonna make a Marine out of you.
LOGAN:
Get over. Go through.
Up!
See.
I've been working on my pop-ups
all week.
KEITH: All right. That's my boy.
BETH: There you go. Get in the car.
LOGAN:
See.
- How's old Thigh-Bolt working out for you?
- Do me a favor, okay?
Try and remember
this is a charity game.
What the hell's that supposed to mean?
Don't push him too hard, okay?
Hey, you know what?
When Benny's on your time,
you guys do what you want.
You can plant your flowers, you can do
your crochet, play the fiddle, whatever.
When he's with me we do it my way.
- Have fun, sweetie. Seat belt.
- Bye, Mom.
- Need to give the kid some room to breathe.
I'm okay.
No.
Cooper.
Cooper, stop.
That's $9. Thank you.
BETH:
I'm gonna get going.
I'll be back later to help you pack up.
Hey. What's up?
KEITH: Unh. There you go.
BETH: Oh.
- What happened?
BEN: We won!
Oh, he took his eye off a ground ball.
It's not as bad as it looks.
He just got a little nosebleed.
I still stopped it. Got my glove down,
kept my body in front. Only one run scored.
Ha, ha. It was the play of the game.
Tell you what,
might make a man out of him yet.
Why don't you go on inside?
Take a shower. I'll be right there.
- See you later, buddy.
BEN: Bye, Dad.
What? It was an accident.
You really don't see it.
See what?
That boy would run through
a brick wall for you.
What does that gotta do with him
not being able to field a ground ball?
- Huh?
- Okay.
Don't worry about it.
Please go home, Keith.
Hey, wait a second. Hey.
Who do you think
you're talking to, huh?
Keith, calm down.
You calm down.
Let me tell you something.
That's my son in there too, and I can
take that boy anytime I want. You got that?
Let go of my arm. Let go of my arm.
- What's the matter?
LOGAN: You should do as she says.
Let go of her arm.
BETH:
God!
Gosh, I hope that this heals up
before your birthday.
Your friends' parents are going
to think that I beat you.
I don't have to have a party.
Dad says I'm kind of getting old for them.
That is ridiculous. Of course you're gonna
have a party. You only turn 8 once.
You only turn every age once.
Shower. Now.
BETH:
Thank you for that.
He can't really take Ben away
from you, can he?
You haven't met Keith's father.
Why don't you just leave?
If I tried to take Ben out of Hamden,
I could lose him altogether.
LOGAN: It's none of my business,
but how did you end up...? I mean, what...
What possessed me to marry him?
Picture this:
Senior year, he was captain of the football
team. I thought that I was in love.
Then I got pregnant.
He asked, I said yes.
Only thing is, he didn't quite realize
I expected him to stop dating.
I don't want to go anywhere else.
This is our home.
Has been forever.
Whatever else Keith may be,
he'll always be Ben's dad.
I just want to make sure you're okay.
Thank you.
See you in the morning.
Come on, buddy. Come on.
Hey!
When are we gonna get those beers?
I won't forget.
BETH: It's just a casual beer
between coworkers.
Mm-hm.
It's not a date.
Oh. Did I say anything?
- Do you think life has a plan for you?
- Oh, jeez.
Do you?
If it does, it hasn't shared it with me.
Why did you enlist?
It was the family business.
Oh, I had you figured for a military brat.
Your father was a Marine?
And his dad before him.
So you signed up for them?
The first tour was for them.
The second and third were for the guys
that were still out there.
What time do you think it is?
Am I boring you?
I want to show you something.
Come on. We have to go now.
BETH: This is where I come
when I want to be alone.
LOGAN:
She's a beauty.
BETH:
Dad grew up around boats.
He was a vet, but he loved to fish.
Mom was a music teacher.
She couldn't stand it.
LOGAN: You've never mentioned
your parents before.
BETH: They died in a car accident
when we were very young.
LOGAN: Sorry, I was just...
- It's a fair question.
I guess that's why
Drake and I were so close.
We were so lucky to have Nana.
Dad took Drake fishing all the time.
When he taught him how to steer this thing,
he couldn't have been more than 6 or 7.
- What about you?
- Oh.
I love this boat.
I know she doesn't look like much now,
but she could really fly.
- Well, we should take her out sometime.
- Oh.
Can't even get her started now.
LOGAN:
That's too bad.
Are you sure you're okay to drive?
I'm perfectly sober,
thank you very much.
Hold on.
You do realize we're gonna
have to do this all again?
You never told me that joke.
Is there any way
I can make it up to you?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's been so long.
- God.
- It's all right.
You should be kissed every day,
every hour, every minute.
Keith?
Oh, Danny.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Put that down.
You know y'all were doing 50
through town?
Oh, like hell we were.
Keith put you up to this, didn't he?
- Didn't he?
- Beth, you need to go home.
- Oh.
- Let's just say it never happened.
BETH: No.
- Sorry.
BETH:
No, it's me that's sorry.
Well, that's as clean as it'll ever be.
Please go.
Oh, shit.
LOGAN:
Ben.
You know, you should read this when
I'm done. I think it could really help you.
Who says I need any help?
My undefeated record.
Oh, is that so?
- Guess you're looking for Mom.
- What makes you think that?
She's in the barn.
Ben?
Light.
What are you...?
I just wanted to stop by
and make sure you're okay.
You just wanted to stop by?
- How mysterious.
- Okay.
I wanted to see you.
BEN:
Mom.
What is it, sweetie?
The ice cream is melting.
Can I just eat it?
Just put it in a bowl first.
BEN:
Okay.
Feel like some ice cream?
LOGAN:
Come on. Yeah.
Let's see what you got.
LOGAN:
Yeah.
Come on.
LOGAN:
Yeah. Now it... Perfect.
Show me.
Come on. Yeah.
Champion.
Go ahead, say it.
Say what?
Oh, don't be shy.
You know you want to.
"I told you so." There. Feel better?
So you were right.
Only thing is, it's not gonna work out.
No guy could ever be this good.
They never are.
Eventually, it will end.
Things will get awkward.
He'll quit, Ben will be
heartbroken, it will be my fault.
Yeah. And he'll grow up hating you.
He'll move far away, he'll never call.
I'll be dead and you'll be alone.
Forever.
BEN:
Pick a card, any card.
BEN:
Tell me when to stop.
Stop.
BETH: I know. Just the turkey things, right
on the counter next to the fridge, I think.
Impressive trick.
I'm gonna grab this from you.
Oh!
Excuse me.
KEITH:
What the hell's he doing here?
Ben invited him.
It's his party.
You think I don't know what's going on
around here?
Hmm?
I don't think I like you seeing him.
Well, you don't have a say in it.
I certainly have a say
in who my son sees.
Hmm?
And if I was to say that his mom's
unhealthy relationship...
...with some crazy drifter...
...was creating an unstable
environment for my boy...
...I don't think there's a judge in the world
who'd disagree with me.
Certainly not in this town.
He wants you out of my life.
I can't risk losing Ben.
I'm sorry, Beth.
I didn't come here to make things
harder for you.
You don't know what I'm dealing with.
I do know that you deserve
better than this.
How you doing? You want a ride?
What do you want?
I wanna get you a job.
You gotta be tired of cleaning up
dog shit by now. Ha-ha-ha.
I know some people.
I could make a couple calls...
...and get you something worthy
of a veteran.
What do you think?
You don't know who you're dealing with.
I know exactly who I'm dealing with.
I've known guys like you my whole life.
You think a gun and a badge
and a name make you something.
- You better watch your mouth.
- I'm done talking to you.
ELLIE: So are you planning to let him
bully you all your life?
BETH:
Excuse me?
You heard me.
You know, sacrificing everything in life
for our children is...
It's not selfless. It's...
Well, it's ridiculous.
I am doing the best that I can.
Really?
BEN:
Ooh. The power of earth.
KEITH: Hey.
BEN: You need some help?
Yeah. Grab that rag and start
at the back. I'll meet you in the middle.
Hey. We're gonna have some pizza
tonight if you wanna stay for dinner.
You know what, Keith?
That's not gonna work anymore.
I figured it out. You don't want full custody
any more than I want you to have it.
You can try and take him,
but I will fight you.
I will fight you and your family's lawyers.
- Okay, calm down.
- I am a damn good mother.
Okay, just...
You know that.
Everybody knows that.
You wanna go back to court,
you just tell me when.
Otherwise, you stay the hell out of my life.
BETH:
Why did you come here?
To find you.
LOGAN:
Aah. Come on.
Oh, shit. Damn Mary Carlson fell
and broke her wrist, bless her heart.
Fifty cents to the swear jar, Nana.
ELLIE:
Who's gonna play for the choir now?
- Probably sound better without her.
- You could do it.
- I could.
- Could you?
- Maybe.
- Maybe? It's only a few hymns.
- I'm gonna need your help.
- No way.
I can't do it alone, though.
I said I don't wanna do it.
- Hey, can I join you?
- Sure.
What if I screw up?
That's the best part about
performing in a church.
Forgiving audience. Right?
I can't get up there alone.
I need you to be the guy next to me.
What do you mean?
It's how Marines work.
We watch each other's backs.
You don't worry about yourself.
You think about the guy next to you.
All right?
All right.
LOGAN:
How many moves do I have left?
BEN:
You're done.
Let's move. Come on.
Hey, hey. Give it.
Come on, come on. Hey.
CHOIR : And o'er
Jesus, Jesus
Precious Jesus
Oh, for grace
To trust Him more
And now, we'll have
a special musical offering.
- He's so scared.
BOY: He can't play that.
He can play.
JUDGE: You know, I had no idea
he could play like that.
I'm gonna have him play my victory song
come November.
- He'll be ready.
- Thank you.
I was wondering if you've found anybody
to take over for Julie's class next semester.
I don't know. Have I?
BETH:
I'll call you tomorrow.
- Keith. Hey, Keith.
- Hmm?
Remember I told you about that guy
showing Beth's picture around?
- Yeah, so?
- Yeah, so, that's the guy.
BEN:
I wanna run home with Zeus.
What's up?
- What do you want now, Keith?
- I gotta talk to you.
It's Sunday night.
Can't this wait?
No, Beth. Look, this is just
strictly police business.
Come on, Keith.
Where did you get that?
Your boy Logan had it.
I take it you didn't give it to him.
This was Drake's.
He didn't wander into town by chance,
Beth.
He came here to find you.
When he first got here,
he was asking all around about you...
...showing that picture to everybody.
You know what they said
about friendly fire...
No.
I'm not accusing anyone.
I'm just saying that a guy like that...
No friends, no people, just shows up here
with something so personal?
I mean, now, that just don't
smell right to me.
I've seen stalkers,
I've seen how they think.
And once they fixate on somebody...
...they're capable of anything.
- Where did you get this?
- I found it.
This was Drake's. He took it
everywhere with him. He told me.
LOGAN: Listen to me.
BETH: No, you listen to me.
You didn't come here by accident.
You came here to find me.
I know I should have told you.
I tried. I didn't know how.
Try telling me now.
LOGAN:
Move! Move, move, move!
It was in the morning...
...after a night raid.
I just found it.
In the middle of nowhere.
I tried to find out who lost it.
I never stopped trying,
but nobody claimed it.
Finding something like that...
...in a war...
...was like finding an angel in hell.
So I kept it with me.
Then I survived a lot of things.
Things that I had no right to.
I promised myself that if I made it out...
...I would find that girl...
...and thank her...
...for saving my life...
...when others weren't so lucky.
But I couldn't find the words.
How do you explain something that you
can't even understand yourself?
Understand this:
This was Drake's.
It was meant to keep him alive.
I wish it had.
You should go.
Now.
BEN:
Logan, wait.
Oh, man. You sure?
You need it more than I do.
Take care of your mom, all right?
BEN:
I thought I was the guy next to you.
LOGAN:
You're my best buddy.
I'll always be next to you.
Tell Zeus I said bye.
- Here you go.
- You're welcome.
That's when you know
KEITH:
I tried to warn her.
I tried to tell her he was no good.
She didn't wanna listen to me.
- About ready here, bud?
KEITH: Mm.
That's when you know
Let's do it.
MOORE: You ain't driving nowhere.
KEITH: Oh.
- And here's your change.
KEITH: Yep.
- Get your coat.
- All right.
Appreciate it, J.D.
BARTENDER:
Hey, no problem, man.
- Thank you.
KEITH: Whoo.
Hey, hang on, man. Stop the car.
- I think you need to let it go...
- Hey, stop the goddamn car!
MOORE:
He ain't worth it.
Shit.
Hey. Hey, soldier boy.
Don't you walk away from me
when I talk to you.
Mm.
MOORE:
Keith, come on.
You ain't got nothing to say for yourself?
LOGAN: Zeus!
- Jesus.
- Easy, boy. Easy.
MOORE: Stand back. Stand back.
Man, easy.
MAN: Are you crazy?
- Easy.
MOORE: Come on, Keith. Put it down.
- Shut up. Ah!
MOORE:
Hey. Hang on, bud.
Hang on.
You're not a bad guy, Keith.
Zeus.
Okay, folks. Let's go, let's move along.
Everything's fine.
Could have killed him.
I talked to Sheriff Grey.
He gonna look the other way.
Now, come on, Keith. Hey.
You pull yourself together now, all right?
Gonna be fine.
Yep.
It'll all blow over by the time
the election rolls around.
You're not the only one whose life
got better when he came here.
You might not believe it, but I think
he was meant to find that photo.
Right. Right. Of course.
It was all part of a plan.
None of us are in control of anything
that happens. It's all down to fate.
Well, you call it what you like,
but I think it happened for a reason.
So you're saying...
...Drake died so that Logan could live?
No. Honey.
Oh, sweetheart.
It's not Logan's fault that he survived.
CASTRO:
I'm on it, Aces.
LOGAN:
"Aces"?
LOGAN:
Zeus, stay here. I'll be right back.
Keith?
What are you doing?
KEITH:
I always loved these plates.
What do you want, Keith?
What do I want?
I want...
I just want us to be a family again.
Please.
Can we be a family again?
I can change.
I have, I've changed.
I can make you happy, Beth.
I can. I can make you happy again.
Keith...
I know you care about Ben...
...but it's not gonna happen for us.
You have to let it go.
Let it go.
Why should I let it go?
All right, maybe I should just go on
and take Ben, now.
Huh? Take him away for good.
Can't say I didn't warn you.
Why don't I just take him
right now?
Where's he at? Benny.
- Ben? Ben.
- Ben.
BETH:
Ben.
Benny!
Hey! Come back!
- He's heading for the tree house.
KEITH: Ben! Come back here!
Ben! Ben!
Ben! Come back here!
Benny! Come here!
It's dangerous out there!
LOGAN:
Beth!
ELLIE:
Go with her, Logan!
LOGAN:
Beth!
KEITH:
Ben!
Come on! Just walk back to me!
Walk back to me right here!
I can't, Dad. It's too shaky.
Just wait right there, I'm coming to you.
Dad, I'm scared.
- Aah! Ben!
BEN: Aah!
Help!
Help! Help me, Dad!
- Aah! Hang on, Ben!
BEN: Help!
Help!
- I can't...
- I'm slipping!
- Help!
- Help me, Dad!
Help! Dad! No!
Hold on, Ben!
Ben! Just stay there!
I can't, Dad!
Hang on, buddy, I'm coming!
- Dad!
KEITH: Hang on!
- Just hang on, I'm coming!
BEN: I can't hold on!
KEITH:
I got you. I got you.
- I need you to let go and grab onto me.
- I can't.
I can't.
Yeah, you can. Now come on.
You can do it.
Ben! Ben!
KEITH: Keep your arm there.
Just hold on tight.
BETH: Ben!
KEITH: Hold on tight and don't let go.
You're gonna be all right.
Logan!
Logan, I need your help!
Ben! Ben!
Here comes Logan.
LOGAN: I got you.
KEITH: Come on. Take him.
- My leg's caught. Take him.
- I'll come back for you.
- Dad!
KEITH: It's okay. I'm fine.
- Dad! Dad!
LOGAN: Almost there.
LOGAN:
I'm gonna go back for Keith.
No!
BEN:
Dad! No!
JUDGE: Here,
I don't want any problems down there.
So keep this road clear so we can get
these vehicles out of here.
Bring it.
Get back to the bridge,
and make sure it's secure, all right?
EMT:
You're all good.
JUDGE:
Thank you.
JUDGE:
Take him.
Okay?
Thank you for saving Benny.
I didn't save him.
Your son did.
All right.
I'm sorry.
Did they find my dad yet?
LOGAN:
How's Ben doing?
- Does he know?
- No.
Poor Keith.
I wish I could have done something more.
You did a wonderful thing.
You and Keith did a wonderful thing.
I'll go get Beth.
Thank you.
I came back because I found this
in the book that Ben gave me.
That's your brother, Drake, isn't it?
Yeah.
I know what happened to him.
I was there.
What do you mean
that you were there?
Our platoons crossed paths
during the night raid.
We were ambushed.
There was this sergeant
that they called "Aces."
One of his men got hit.
He didn't think about himself
for one second.
He just took care of his man.
And then I found your picture
the next morning in the rubble outside.
He must have lost it on the way in.
I know I've made it hard for you
to believe the truth.
And I'm sorry for a lot of things,
but nothing more than that.
I just wanted you to know...
...he didn't die for nothing.
BETH:
Logan, wait.
Don't go.
You belong here.
With us.
LOGAN:
Everyone has their own destiny.
Not everyone makes the choice
to follow it.
And I'm lucky I did.
LOGAN:
Birthday boy, you old enough to steer?
BEN:
Yeah, I am 9, you know.
LOGAN:
Aye, aye, captain.
Take it easy.
- Little more left.
- That way. That way.
