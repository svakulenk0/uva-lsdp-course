Hey!
We did it!
Good luck, soldier.
When's the last time
you saw her?
Our wedding day.
Four years ago.
Let me guess.
Met her on Friday,
married her on Sunday,
shipped out on Monday.
Pretty much.
Me, too. I'll bet we don't
even recognize them.
I'd recognize her
anywhere.
I find the pheasant
to be quite pleasant.
I find the pheasant
to be quite pleasant.
How do you find
the wine?
I find the wine
extraordinarily--
Betty?
I prefer to dine
at home alone.
Paul?
Paul!
When I didn't see you
on the dock--
I didn't know you were
coming today.
Didn't you get
my letters?
I started
to read them, I did,
but after the first few,
I couldn't bear to hear
about all that fighting
and the killing.
I wrote you almost
every day.
I know.
And I kept them. Look.
See?
Oh, Paul, even the thought of you
in all that danger,
it was just too much.
I knew if I got them,
you were still alive.
That's all
I cared about--
that you were alive...
safe.
That's all that was
important to me.
Can you forgive me?
Yeah, sure.
I wrote to you.
You got those, right?
Got a few.
I told you
I wasn't a big writer.
I quite agree
the distinction is dubious.
It's a course I'm taking.
Self-improvement.
His name's Armistead.
He makes tons of money.
The whole country's
making money
hand over fist.
You've been away,
out of touch.
You don't know,
but you will.
I went to make sure Mr. Sweeney
held your job, like he promised.
He said you could start
the day you got back.
Just make sure
you wear your uniform.
Who could resist
a war hero?
Of course
I negotiated a raise.
Betty, I don't want
to go back to selling chocolate.
You've got
something better.
No...
I don't.
But, you know...
in the war,
I had time to think about
what's important,
about what I want
out of life
for me, for us.
I wrote you all this
in the letters.
Are we back to those
old letters again?
You want me to read
the letters?
No. It's just you'd understand
what I'm feeling,
what I want.
Sweetie...
Tell me what you want.
I thought...
some time.
Time's money.
I want things, Paulie.
My whole life
I've been without.
I want things.
Don't you want...
things?
And you'll wear your uniform,
won't you?
My uniform?
To sell chocolates...
millions and millions
of them.
Won't you?
Yes.
Here, let me help.
I'm sorry.
He's going to kill me.
It's just glass.
You can replace it easy.
Sorry.
No, no, it's my fault.
Look at this mess.
Here you go.
Are you all right?
Ticket, please.
Had an accident.
Yes.
Thanks.
Hey!
Hey!
Thanks.
Speed you were going,
you could have made
Sacramento before me.
You smell anything?
No.
Phew!
Hi.
Oh, my God.
I'm so embarrassed.
I wanted to apologize,
but you looked
so peaceful.
Apology accepted.
Good book?
Quite a mouthful.
It's required reading.
College?
My master's degree.
Playing hooky?
No. I'm going home.
My family
has a vineyard in Napa.
And you?
Uh, business
in Sacramento.
The train goes
to Sacramento.
My ticket didn't.
I mean, it did
when I got on,
but...
Oh, no.
I think this is yours.
Yup.
I thought it was a mistake.
I'm so sorry.
Is this seat taken?
How are you?
Look, uh, I'm Bill.
This is my buddy
Herman.
And you're, uh...
Not interested.
Ooh.
I had
a girlfriend once
that always
used to say
she was
not interested.
It was never what she meant,
was it, Herman?
Most definitely not.
Not after she
got to know me.
Stop it.
Fellas.
Fellas.
Lady doesn't want
to be bothered.
Just let her be.
Oh, now what are we
going to do?
Shut up, Herman.
I think
he broke my nose.
I got to get
to Sacramento.
Not on this bus,
you don't.
I don't think
we've been properly introduced.
I'm Paul Sutton.
Victoria Aragon.
I'm sorry
about the bus.
Um...
I feel terrible.
All the problems
I've caused you.
You should just
keep going.
Who knows what
will happen next?
There's always
the possibility
of a forest fire,
I suppose.
Why aren't you
on the bus?
My stop.
You're waiting
for a ride.
No. No.
A miracle.
He's going to kill me.
Who?
My father.
If you're still worried
about that picture--
It's not about
the picture.
Oh, God.
Look, it's none
of my business,
but if you'd like
to talk about it...
''I was not meant
for the conventions of this world,
''not meant to be
tied down.
I'm a...
free spirit.''
Who's a free spirit?
My professor.
He and I were...
We--We were...
I don't think just because
some free spirit
broke up with you--
I'm pregnant.
Oh.
You're very upset.
I can understand that.
Definitely understand that.
But, Victoria,
look at the positive side.
It's a new life
coming into the world.
That's a miracle
in itself, right?
''I will kill anyone
who dishonors my family.''
How many times
has he said that?
A hundred times,
a million times?
I'm sure it's just
a figure of speech.
My father means
what he says.
Always.
He's--He's very
old-fashioned.
If I come home this way
without a husband,
he'll kill me.
I know he will.
How about if you do show up
with a husband?
Who does what,
comes for the day
and then just leaves?
Sure. Comes to meet the family,
stays one night,
leaves in the morning,
writes a letter
saying he's...
Abandoned me.
It happens.
You're very kind
for trying to help me.
Maybe it might work...
but...
there's nobody.
Miss Aragon.
Victoria.
There's me.
Was it horrible,
the fighting?
Once the shooting starts,
you just go blank.
The trick was to get your mind
on something else.
What did you do?
Write letters
to my wife.
In my head.
Then later, I would
write them down.
About the war.
About what I'd like
our life to be like when I got home--
The perfect little house,
kids running around
in the yard with the dog,
great job.
She must have cherished
every word.
Yeah, every word.
You're very kind
to do this for me.
And the baby.
I'm doing it
for the both of you.
Then we both thank you.
You're both welcome.
We call it Las Nubes.
It means the clouds.
It's beautiful.
Yeah.
Well, if we're going
to do this right...
The wedding bonbon
deluxe.
Big seller
around June.
We're unarmed.
Don't shoot.
Hello, Papa.
Victoria.
Who's this?
Paul Sutton...
my husband.
Marie!
Marie!
It'll be O.K.
Like hell
it'll be O.K.!
I will not
allow this.
I'll go to the pope
himself
to get this undone.
We weren't married
in a church.
Marie!
¿Qué pasa, Alberto?
Mama.
Victoria!
¿Cuál es
el problema?
Here is the problem.
Is this how
you were brought up?
To betray
your mother?
Betray your father?
I did not betray
anyone.
What are you
talking about?
What do you think
I'm talking about?
The gringo.
His name is Paul.
Mi hijita linda.
Abuelita.
I told you.
I told you!
A girl's place
is here, at home!
Here!
Not alone in some city
doing God knows what.
I'm going to school there.
That's what I'm doing.
What is going on?
Your daughter,
she is married!
Felicidades,
querida.
Mama!
Grandpa,
make him stop.
Please.
Ha! That's right.
That's right.
Coddle her.
The whole bunch of you.
But I tell you right now,
this will not stand
so long as I draw breath.
I swear before God.
Alberto!
You are so unfair.
Me? Ha ha!
I'm unfair?
I came home
to tell my family
that I spit
on their trust?
I'm the one
who came home
to rub in their face
that I married this--
this...
What do you do?
Chocolate.
I sell chocolate.
No.
You...
You are the head
of the family.
Say something.
I am Pedro Aragon.
Welcome
to our happy family.
Thank you.
May I?
Sure.
Of course.
Help yourself.
Huh?
Ugh!
¡Cierra la puerta!
It's wonderful!
It's wonderful!
Why can he never just say,
''I'm happy for you.
Congratulations, Victoria''?
Why must everything
be a drama?
It's a bit
of a shock.
Not for Grandma
or Grandpa.
Not for you.
Why is he
always this way?
I hate him!
Victoria!
He is your father.
He has never
taken change well.
Even as a child,
he was this way.
Only with the vines
he has patience.
Maybe he should have
some for us, too.
That would be nice
for a change.
You could have
at least prepared us.
A call, a letter
would have been wiser.
I wanted to surprise you.
Well, you certainly
succeeded.
He wants me to marry
some man in Mexico
I have never even met
just because he has
the right bloodlines.
I'm not a horse, Mama.
It's my choice
who I marry, not his.
Muchachas,
la comida.
How many times
have you told me,
''The heart wants
what the heart wants''?
And is this what
your heart wants?
Yes.
Really and truly?
Really and truly.
Everything
will be fine. You'll see.
Everything
will be perfect.
Ooh!
What a delicate ring.
You are beautiful
tonight.
Marriage becomes her,
no?
Mama?
Dear God, bless this food
we are about to eat,
and bless the harvest
of the grapes you have given us
in your wisdom
and grace, amen.
- Amen.
- Amen, amen.
Bon appetit.
This is pumpkin
flower soup.
It's a specialty
of my grandmother's.
It's delicious.
It's been in the family
cookbook
before your Declaration
of Independence was signed.
So, with all the commotion,
we never heard the whole story
of how you two met.
I was on leave in June.
July.
Just after I moved
to the city.
That's right.July.
At the USO.
I didn't know
you worked at the USO.
Um...
I wasn't actually
working there.
Then what were you doing
in a hall filled
with strange men?
Pedro.
Mi abuelo vivió a--
Excuse me.
My grandfather lived
to 1 02,
and he used salt
like a fish in the sea.
My great-grandfather
was 1 06!
So, tell us, Mr. Sutton,
since we now have such a clear picture
of how you two met...
where are you from?
Moline. Moline, Illinois.
Mmm.
Wherever that is.
It's in the middle
of the country.
Exactly in the middle,
right?
Right.
And your parents,
they are
still in Moline?
I never knew my parents.
Oh. Who brought you up,
the fairies?
I grew up in a home.
Whose home?
I meant an orphanage.
Wonderful.
This is just wonderful.
My daughter
can trace her ancestors
back 400 years
to some of the finest families
in Mexico,
and you are telling me
she has married a man
with no past?
Or worse...
a man with no past
and no future!
Wonderful.
You don't know
that he has no future.
You don't know
anything about him.
Do you?
Yes. I know he knows
how to love somebody.
I know he wants a house
with kids and a dog.
A great job.
You mean,
like the one he has?
Excuse me.
It was very good.
Thank you.
He doesn't pull
any punches, does he?
I'm sorry.
You must think
they're horrible.
When I was a kid...
every night I'd climb
up to the roof of the orphanage,
and I'd make a wish
on every star I could see.
That's a lot of wishing.
It usually boiled down
to one wish, really.
What was that?
What you have in there.
Everyone always
telling you
how you should
live your life?
Better than having
no one telling you.
I don't know
about that.
I do.
That's no reason
for him to treat you that way.
No.
And I was going
to say something, but...
I thought,
''What if it were me?
''A strange man
comes into my house,
''tells me he's married
my only daughter,
and I'm the last to know?''
Probably act the same way.
No, you wouldn't.
I don't know
about that.
I do.
It's only another
eight hours,
I'll be back
on the road.
Anyway, I think
the worst part's over, don't you?
This bed
was part of my dowry
when I married
Mr. Aragon.
It was my grandmother's
before that.
Her dowry.
She had it brought
all the way from Paris.
He was a diplomat,
my grandfather.
And this is
where we've spent
our first
wedding nights,
my mother...
my grandmother...
and me.
We can sleep
in Pedro's room.
In that teeny-tiny
little bed
on your
wedding night?
Ay, hija, no.
You need room...
to maneuver.
Mommy!
I know this is not
your first night together,
but I would like
to think it is.
It's just that
from the beginning,
all our marriages
have been so blessed.
You know,
it is out of love
that my husband roars so.
We are very traditional
people, Paul,
and this modern world
takes a little getting used to.
He'll come around.
Love each other...
always.
Ha!
First he comes into my house,
steals my daughter.
And now...
Now he takes my bed?
No!
Vida...
You don't want to see it,
but your daughter
is a woman.
And she was not stolen
any more
than you stole me.
Or have you forgotten
that little room under the stairs
in my father's house, hmm?
I asked for
your hand properly,
with respect.
Who is he?
He is nobody.
He is her choice,
and she is our daughter.
Alberto, it is from us
that she has learned to be who she is.
If we don't have
confidence in her,
how can we have confidence
in ourselves?
First you go
and wish them good night
so they won't go to bed
thinking that you're
furious with them.
But I am!
Shh!
I am furious
with them.
You should smile more.
You are so handsome
when you smile.
First go
and wish them good night.
Go.
Do you like
selling chocolate?
No, not really.
Why are you
doing it?
It's part of
what I thought
I'd use
this trip for,
try and figure
things out for myself.
But you have things
figured out.
It's not that easy.
It's complicated.
It doesn't sound
that complicated to me.
You're not married.
I'm sorry.
It's just not a good time
for me now.
You've been wonderful...
more than wonderful.
Would you
turn around, please?
There'll be someone
for you, Victoria.
You don't have to
make me feel better.
No, I believe that.
I believe that there's
a perfect someone for everyone,
someone who'll love you
no matter what.
Would you marry
someone
if it wasn't your baby
they were carrying?
If I loved her.
Good night.
Good night.
May I?
One moment, Papa.
Your mother
sent me to wish you
good night.
Good night, Papa.
Good night,
Mr. Aragon.
Good night.
Does the door
have a lock?
No.
Do you think
he suspects?
I don't know.
Better not take
the chance.
In case he comes back,
I should stay.
Yes.
Good night.
Aah!
Victoria!
Victoria!
Aah!
It's all right.
It's all right.
Just a dream.
It's nothing.
Must be the change...
coming home,
everything so fast.
What's the matter?
Frost!
Alberto...
what you think?
It doesn't reach
the inside.
We can still
save them.
We have a chance.
Now!
Sí, Don Alberto.
How can I help?
Do you know
how to fly?
If you'll show me.
We are going to
lose everything,
and you want me
to take time to show you?
Look.
Spread out.
Spread out!
Like a butterfly.
If you're going
to help,
help!
Butterfly.
Get the heat down
on the grapes.
Follow me.
Up...
down...
up...
down.
That's it.
Come on. With me.
The bus doesn't leave
until 1 1 A.M.
Then it's daylight.
Everyone will be up.
It's better this way.
Less questions.
Yes.
I wish you
the best of luck.
You, too.
Buenos días, señor Paul.
It's the call of the grape that
robs our sleep.
When she's ripe,
she calls to a man.
Give me that.
Toma,Jose.
Walk with me.
Bring the chocolates.
Here.
Here!
Jose.
Buenos días,
don Pedro.
Buenos días.
Ha ha ha.
You know, everybody
gives you advice
how to grow old.
And the doctors,
they say,
don Pedro,
no chocolates.
Don Pedro, no salt
and no cigars
and little brandy
as possible.
What the hell
do the doctors know
about the needs...
of a man's soul?
Nada!
Nothing.
Uh...
May I?
Oh, this one.
This looks like
my granddaughter's...
uh...
I never
noticed that.
Hmm.
Ohh...
Oh ho ho ho ho!
Excelente!
You know, in 1 580,
the first Aragon, also a Pedro,
came from Spain
to Mexico
with a dream
in his head,
the clothes
on his back,
and the root
from the family's vineyard
inside his pocket.
Excuse me.
May I...see one more?
Which one?
Ah, that's no good.
Try one more.
Ahh...
That's wonderful.
Ha ha ha ha.
Come...
I will show you
something.
This is the root
I brought with me,
a descendant
from the root
the first Pedro
brought with him.
All our vines
come from this one.
It's not just
the root of Las Nubes.
It's the root...
of our lives,
of Victoria's life.
Now that you're
a part of all this,
a part of us,
it is the root
of your life.
You are an orphan
no longer.
So...
you will stay
with your family
while we harvest
the fruit?
Ah...
It's a special time.
It's a time of...magic.
I really can't.
I have commitments.
What about the commitments
to your family?
W-What can be
more important than that?
I would like to,
really.
But I can't.
He said you...
would not stay.
Who did?
Alberto.
He said, ''The first chance
the gringo gets,
he will leave her.''
His exact words.
I'm not leaving her.
I'm--
No, no, no, no.
I understand.
Just my...
poor granddaughter.
He will whip her
with it.
She'll be the one
to pay for your commitments.
Such a pity.
Such a sweet girl.
But it would
just be the difference of a day.
The most important day
of our year,
the day that makes
or breaks our fortunes--
that's what he will
throw up to her...
for the rest
of her life.
I know...
my son.
Don Pedro.
Eh?
You're right.
It's only one day.
I'll stay.
Right.
May I?
It's a good thing.
You have no more
chocolates to sell, anyway.
Come on.
I thought you were
leaving.
I thought it would be better for you
if I stuck around...
at least until
the harvest.
Don't you have
chocolates to sell?
Family comes first.
Hey, everybody,
I'm home!
Ha ha ha ha!
Hey, there.
Ohh!
¡Pedro! ¡Sí!
Ah! Ha ha ha!
Hiya, sis.
Hi,Jose.
Bienvenido.
Hi, Grandpa!
Ha ha ha!
Hi, Grandma.
Oh! Ha ha ha!
My favorite
chili's ready?
¡Claro que sí,
Pedrito!
Saluda a su madre.
Hi, Mom.
Oh, at last!
Hi, Pop.
Sorry I'm late.
Pedro.
This is my husband
Paul Sutton.
Paul, my brother.
You got hitched?
Hey, that's swell!
Oh!
Victoria Sutton.
I like that.
Welcome to
the family.
I'm Pete.
Thanks.
Pete.
Who is Pete?
Pa, come on.
I don't know any Pete.
I know I pay
a fortune in tuition
to Stanford University
for a Pedro Alberto Aragon Limantour.
Maybe I am paying
for the wrong person
and I should
stop the check!
Glad to meet you,
Pedro.
Can we begin now?
Victoria.
Make sure he knows
what he's doing.
We don't want him
cutting off his fingers
and getting blood
on the grapes.
It would ruin
the taste of the wine.
¡Que empiece la vendimia!
¡Sí, señor!
Aren't you happy
you stayed?
No, gracias.
¡Listo!
Papa.
Salud.
¿Listos todos?
Come on.
¡ Tiren las uvas!
How do they feel?
They're
a little big.
Clothes are
like family.
You have to
live in them a while
before you get
the perfect fit.
But you are doing great.
I don't know if everyone would
share your opinion.
It's not easy
being in charge.
It was not easy for me.
It's not easy for him.
Every man has to
find his own way.
But I have faith
in my son,
and I have faith in you.
But your fly
is open.
My wife's family,
the Aztecs,
have a belief
that you have to
have the permission
of the four winds
to harvest
what the earth gives.
Isn't she beautiful?
¡Las mujeres!
Victoria!
Come on! You're a married
woman now.
What about Pedro?
He's not married.
Neither are we.
La la la la la la

I want you more than anything,
Victoria.
You can't imagine
how I want you.
But I'm not free.
And I won't
hurt you that way.
I won't.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Pop, we can lead the market instead
of chase after it.
Where the hell
is my hat?
We can raise money
through limited partnerships.
Hi, Paul.
Hi, Pedro.
Morning, Mr. Aragon.
So what do you
think, Pop?
About what?
Modernizing
the operation.
The limited
partnerships.
You take in a partner,
you take on trouble.
You can always borrow
from the bank.
Listen,just because
you harvested a few grapes
doesn't give you
a say.
Stick to your candy,
and keep your nose
out of our business.
Now... tell me what's
going on here...
that you sleep
one night on the floor,
the next
on the couch.
You'll use any excuse
to make him feel unwelcome,
won't you?
There is something
wrong here.
This whole thing
smells wrong.
A girl comes home
with a husband
nobody ever heard of...
with her suitcases
full as when she went away...
like she has
no place else to go.
Where's my hat?
You don't want me
here?
I'll leave.
Is that
what you want?
I want the truth.
That's what I want.
No, you don't.
The only truth you want is the truth
according to you.
That's the only truth
you can accept.
Try me.
The truth is,
she came home
because she loves
her family.
I told you...
stay out of
our business.
She is my business.
You were looking
for this?
Señora!
Señora.
I appreciate it
very much,
but I don't
have time.
It smells.
I know,
but I have to leave.
I have business.
Don Pedro has
finished your business, I think, no?
And besides, you
must see it through.
See what through?
Your fate...
what brought
you here.
Nothing
brought me here.
I brought me here.
Ah.
-
-
Oh!
Ohhh...
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Here, let me
help you inside.
No. We had a plan.
You were going to
stay for one night
and go back
to your wife.
We should stick
to the plan.
I can't leave you
like this.
And tomorrow? Will you stay
tomorrow, too?
And the day
after that?
Go home, Paul.
You still
have a wife.
Leave it
at the station.
Victoria, please--
You can't help me
anymore, Paul!
No one can help me.
It's not
your problem.
It's not my problem.
I can't leave.
Victoria!
Victoria?
Victoria!
Don't think that just because
you married her
any of this
is yours...
if you married her
at all.
What's that
supposed to mean?
I wasn't there.
I didn't see a wedding.
I didn't even see
a wedding certificate.
And don't think
that just because
I speak with an accent
I think
with an accent.
For four years
that I've been at war,
to do what I had to do,
I had to keep myself
closed off.
What's your reason?
What the hell
are you talking about?
Reason for what?
For shutting your daughter
out of your heart.
Can't you see
how amazing she is?
How alive?
My whole life, I've dreamed of getting
the kind of love
your daughter
tries to give you.
I would die
for what you have.
Why can't you
just love her?
She's so easy to love.
You know nothing
about my daughter!
You hear me?
Nothing!
I know that she is
good...and strong...
and deserves all the love
this world has to give.
Can't you see that?
How wonderful...
how special she is?
You see this?
This land...
this vineyard!
This is 365 days
a year.
Who do you think
I do this for?
For them!
All of them!
I love my family!
You should let them
know it.
Paul. Hey, Paul.
Hey.
Brandy.
Ohhh...
The finest.
I made it
myself.
Huh?
The secret
about brandy...
is age.
The secret
of everything...
Ha ha ha ha!
is age.
Hija...
Are you all right?
He only
went to work.
He will come back.
What the hell
is that?
My uniform.
Ah.
Of course.
Ha ha ha ha.
Newlyweds.
What else
do they do
but make love
and war?
Did you talk to her?
I tried.
Wouldn't make
a difference.
Talking between
men and women
never solves
anything.
Where we think...
they feel.
They are creatures...
of the heart.
Please.
Sit down.
Don Pedro--
No, no, no.
Please. Come on.
- Come on. Give me that.
- Don Pedro--
No, no.
I'll miss my bus
again.
You make yourself
comfortable.
Please. Tomorrow we will
go to the festival
for the wine blessing.
The bus will be there.
I have
the perfect solution
for you.
Ha ha ha!
Here.
Salud.
Salud.
Amor
My love
If you call me,
my love
Allow me
to call you
Beloved
-
-  My love
I will cherish you
For
Ever
Thank you.
Isn't that the most
romantic thing you ever heard?
Maybe it loses
a little bit on translation.
No, no,
no, no, no.
All right, now.
Muchachos...
Otra vez.
Esta vez el va
cantar. Vamos.
Now you sing.
Amor
Mi se llamas
amor
That's all right,
that's all right, that's all right.
It's all right.
You did wonderful.
Let's let the experts
do it themselves.
Amor
Si me llamas amor...
You're a gringo.
Nice, but still
a gringo.
The heart you
are talking to is Mexican.
You speak to it in the language
it understands.
You...
You...
be strong.
Ah. Stand
right here.
Right here.
All right.
Salud.
Mmm.
No, no, no.
You've had enough.
All right.
You boys...
wait for my signal.
¿A usted quién
ha invito?
Ay, señor.
¡Sáquese de aquí!
Amor
Si me llamas amor
Si me dejas amarte
Mi bien
Alberto.
Alberto.
Listen.
La la la
la la la
Llamaradas
Amor
Si me llamas
Amor
Si me dejas amarte
Mi bien
Yo te voy a adorar
Amor
Si me llamas amor
You keep watching
the window.
When the light
comes on,
you are saved.
Yo te voy...
Just watch
the window.
Las estrellas
nos verán
Asombradas
He seems to love her.
Llamaradas
Mm-hmm.
Maybe I...
I've been too tough
on him.
Si me das
tu valor
Si me atrevo
A quererte
Mi sol
Te voy a idolatrar
¡Ay! Ha ha ha ha!
Los ángeles
nos traerán
La ternura
What's the matter?
Las flores
nos vestirán
De dulzura
Contigo voy a sonar
Con querubes
Contigo voy a pasear
En las nubes
Contigo voy
a pasera
Paul.
En las nubes
Contigo voy a pasear
En las nubes
Nubes
Now that you're
single, Paul,
don't start having
too much fun at the festival.
Our bus leaves
in 1 0 minutes.
The Aragons!
Oh!
Aah!
The Aragons are coming!
Look!
Whoo!
Whoo!
Whoo!
Whoo!
Hello.
How are you?
MarieJose.
I will now recite
the blessing of the harvest.
We thank you,
Lord in heaven,
for bestowing on us
the bounty of thy harvest.
We ask only
that each life here
be blessed with the full
measure of love,
health, and happiness
that those who
acknowledge God in heaven
justly deserve.
Amen.
- Amen.
- Amen.
- Amen.
Excellent!
- Hooray!
- Hooray!
- Ha ha ha!
Victoria.
Your serenade
was very beautiful.
Will you toast
with me?
What do we toast to?
To...what if.
To what if.
Father Phillipo...
may I introduce
Paul Sutton...
my new son-in-law?
As you can see,
a bona fide war hero.
He helped bring in
the harvest.
Papa...
What? I can't be proud?
This is a blessed surprise.
Congratulations, Victoria!
Thank you.
I gave her
first communion.
Always thought I'd
give her in marriage.
And you shall.
City Hall is not
a proper place
to take your
wedding vows.
Not for my own
daughter.
Tonight...
Listen to me!
Tonight...
I give my daughter's
hand in marriage
before the eyes
of God.
And I will take it
as a personal insult
if you all
do not show up.
Whoo!
You are
all invited!
Why are you
doing this?
A man can change
his mind, can't he?
We have to tell them.
No. I have
to tell them.
I'm not scared now.
Here.
For the baby.
A little present.
What did you
get it for?
Courage under fire.
Paul Sutton...
you're the most honorable man
I have ever known.
Where you headed,
soldier?
San Francisco.
I can get you as far as
San Rafael. Climb in.
Thanks.
What you doing
around these parts?
Walking.
Walking.
In the clouds.
Ha ha ha ha.
Well, welcome
back to Earth.
Ha ha ha ha.
Who's there?
It's me.
You read them.
Yes, Paul, I--
Betty?
Paul. Paul,
listen to me.
It wasn't going to work...
for either of us.
If I'd only read
those letters sooner.
We hardly even
knew each other.
We want different things,
different lives.
Who is it, Betty?
I don't even
like dogs!
It's not what
it appears to be.
Armistead?
Paul,
listen to me.
What we want
is so opposite.
It would've
never worked.
I would've
been miserable.
I came all the way back.
I was ready to try.
Paul, don't do
anything crazy.
I'll just get my things and--
Don't hit me.
I'm not going
to hit you.
Betty...
We could still
be friends.
Friends?
I thought an annulment
would be the easiest.
You just have to...
sign it.
I'm sorry, Paul.
Paul!
Are you all right?
Yeah!
I'm fine!
Ha ha ha ha!
Thanks.
Mr. Aragon?
Mr. Aragon.
I owe you
an apology, sir.
What I did was wrong.
Get off my land.
My intentions were good.
I wanted to protect her.
Stay away from her.
I can't.
She's like the air to me.
I've come to ask you
for her hand in marriage.
You are already married,
you son of a bitch!
Jose!
My gun!
But, Alberto--
My gun! Now!
My marriage was
never meant to be.
It was the war.
It was a mistake.
But it's over...
annulled. Look.
You deceived me...
in my own house...
in my own bed!
Stay away from her!
I love her.
I want to be with her
for the rest of my life,
to take care of her!
Jose! My gun!
Victoria!
My gun!
Victoria!
Paul.
You made me the fool
in front of the world!
It's not even your child
she carries!
It will be
if she'll have me.
I--I'll see you
dead first!
Señorita!
Paul!
Victoria!
Paul!
Pedro!
Victoria!
Stop!
Stop!
I love him!
I love him!
No!
Oh, my God.
Papa.
What--What
have I done?
Oh...
Please.
No!
Don Pedro!
Let me go!
Get away!
I want to stay!
Get--Get away!
Pop! Pop!
Pedro!
Lie down, Pedro!
Don't run!
Lie down!
Pedro!
Aah!
I'm all right!
Papa.
I was afraid.
I was afraid
of losing you.
All of you.
I didn't know
any other way to love.
Can you teach me?
Please...
can you teach me?
The fire burned through...
everything.
There's no root stock
left to...to replant.
Las Nubes...
is finished.
Uhh...
Has it reached
the inside?
It's alive.
It's alive!
Las Nubes lives!
We can plant!
This...
is the root...
of your life...
the root...
of your family.
You are bound
to this land...
and to this family...
by commitment...
by honor...
and by love.
Plant it.
It will grow.
I don't know how.
Victoria.
Help your husband.
Beautiful.
