Lady Crane:
My firstborn son.
My child king, hush.
Listen to the gods,
for you they sing.
Fight no more, sweet child.
Your wars are won.
The wolves are buried
and the false stag done.
Shut your blue eyes, my love.
Let the crown fall.
The Father above
beckons you to his hall.
In Seventh Heaven
I'll see you once more.
But now I seek vengeance
on Sansa the whore
and my brother the Imp
who killed his own king.
Born amongst lions,
our curse from within.
I will slay him, I swear.
With noose or with knife,
though it take me a fortnight,
a moon or my life.
Bobono: What is that
I hear and smell?
-
- Someone I'll soon send to hell.
Man:
Izembaro: You beast, you beast.
You killed my wife.
And now you've taken
your father's life.
No worse child
ever stained this land.
I curse the day I named you.
Bobono:
You're good at that.
Where did you learn?
I'm a jealous woman.
I've always liked bad men
and they've always liked me.
They'd come home wherever
home was that night
stinking of some whore's perfume.
So we'd fight and I'd
put a hole in them.
And then I'd feel terrible,
so I'd patch them up.
And good at putting holes in them.
And that.
What happened to the actress?
Bianca.
She'll have a hard time
finding work as an actress
after what I did to her face.
Mmm.
I never did learn to cook.
But eat.
Eat. You need it.
The company is moving
on to Pentos soon.
You should come with us.
- I can't.
- Why not?
Got a feeling you'd be
good at this sort of work.
And besides, we need a new actress.
I don't think I could
remember all of the lines.
Come with us.
What's left for you here?
You wouldn't be safe.
Not while she's looking for me.
She doesn't have a name.
Where will you go?
Essos is east and Westeros is west.
But what's west of Westeros?
I don't know.
Nobody does.
The edge of the world, maybe.
- What's that?
- Milk of the poppy.
I don't want any.
Sleep is the only way you'll heal.
Trust me, if my soup didn't
kill you, nothing will.
Thing about Gatins, right,
is he used to be pretty.
I was a famous kisser.
You lads know how to kiss proper?
Course we do.
This is for masters, this technique.
- You're not ready.
- I'm ready.
He says he's ready.
All right.
Now, pay attention.
You put your left hand on the
back of the lady's head.
Your right hand holds the small
of the lady's back like so.
Very romantic.
Take your middle finger, yeah,
and you jam it right up her bunghole.
Ah, it smells like pussy to me.
Look at him.
You get hard, boy?
Fuck you!
Disgusting old twats.
Got off on that,
did you, you old fuck?
-
-
Where's the other one?
- The one with the yellow cloak.
- Fuck you!
Those are your last words, fuck you?
Come on, you can do better.
Cunt!
You're shit at dying, you know that?
-
-
_
_
_
_
I'd call that a successful gambit.
- Would you?
- Look around.
The city has come back to life.
- You made a pact with fanatics.
- I did and it worked.
If you shaved your beard with a straight
razor, you'd say the razor worked.
That doesn't mean
it won't cut your throat.
Spoken like a man who has
never had to shave.
I'm going to miss you.
I know.
I hope you're right about
this expedition of yours.
If I don't return,
you'll know I was wrong.
We need friends in Westeros.
And we need ships.
Most of all, we need our queen.
She'll come back.
She has to.
My heart's been broken
too many times already.
I'll walk the rest of the way myself.
I can't go off on a secret mission
in the company of the most
famous dwarf in the city.
Varys.
The most famous dwarf in the world.
Your Grace, several members
of the Faith Militant
have been permitted
entry to the Red Keep.
Have been permitted?
That's rather a tortured
way of putting it.
They demand to see you, Your Grace.
Who permitted them
inside the Red Keep?
The king is aware of their presence?
He's currently in his
chambers at prayer.
Your Grace, His Holiness
the High Septon
wishes to speak with you at
the Great Sept of Baelor.
His Holiness the High Septon
is welcome to see me
here in the Red Keep.
Your Grace, this is not a request.
It is a request, Cousin Lancel.
You are asking me for
something, I'm refusing.
The High Septon commands you.
He promised me I could stay in
the Red Keep until my trial.
He made no such promises.
If you refuse to come of your
own free will--
Get out.
Move aside, ser.
Order your man to step aside
or there will be violence.
I choose violence.
Please tell His High Holiness
he's always welcome to visit.
Looks like a siege, my lady.
You have a keen military mind, Pod.
My lady.
My lady.
Who goes there?!
State your business!
My name is Brienne of Tarth.
Please inform Ser Jaime Lannister
I've come to speak with him.
Tell him I have his sword.
Getting a bit old
to be a squire, aren't we?
Podrick fucking Payne.
I thought you'd be dead by now.
Not yet.
- Are they in there?
- Uh-huh.
You think they're fucking?
What?
No.
Why not?
I'd fuck her.
You'd fuck her, wouldn't you?
- I'm her squire.
- Oh.
Well, he'd
fuck her, that's for sure.
And she'd fuck him, don't you think?
The way she looks at him.
The way all women look at
him is frankly irritating.
I preferred working with the
little brother on that account.
Come on, you're the one
with the magic cock.
You must have shown it to her by now.
- She's training me to fight.
- Is she?
Oh. - An hour in the morning,
an hour at night.
Every day.
Then how come an old cunt like me
can still sneak up and murder you?
Well, that's a different
sort of fighting.
Now, that's the truth, isn't it?
You want to learn
that sort of fighting?
All right.
All right, let's start
with your footwork.
Show me your stance.
Now listen to me, Pod.
See how your feet
are about a yard apart?
Lesson number one, assume
everyone wants to hit you.
'Cause they do, Pod. Everyone
wants to hit a fucking squire.
Do it again.
Come on, don't sulk.
Jaime: I never thought
you'd find her.
Why would you assume that?
In my experience, girls like
her don't live very long.
I don't think you know
many girls like her.
Well, I'm proud of you.
I am. You fulfilled your
oath to Catelyn Stark
Of course, my sister
wants Sansa dead.
The girl is still a suspect
in Joffrey's murder,
so there is that complication.
What the hell are you doing here?
I've come for the Blackfish.
You're welcome to have him.
Lady Sansa desires to take her
ancestral seat back from the Boltons
and assume her rightful
position as Lady of Winterfell.
With what army does she
plan on taking Winterfell?
The Tully army.
They're a bit occupied at the moment.
I was sent here to reclaim Riverrun
currently defended
by the Tully rebels,
so you can see the conundrum.
The Tullys are rebels because
they're fighting for their home?
Riverrun was granted to
the Freys by royal decree.
As a reward for betraying Robb
Stark and slaughtering his family.
Exactly.
We shouldn't argue about politics.
You're a knight, Ser Jaime.
I know there is honor in you.
- I've seen it myself.
- I'm a Lannister.
Don't ask me to betray my own house.
I do no such thing.
Take Riverrun without bloodshed.
Ride south again with your mission
complete and your army intact.
What do you propose?
Allow me to enter Riverrun
under a flag of truce.
Let me try to persuade the
Blackfish to give up the castle.
Why would he abandon
his ancestral home?
Because you'll allow him to lead
the Tully forces safely north.
Have you ever met the Blackfish?
- No.
- He's even more stubborn than you are.
All right.
Try to talk some sense
into the old goat.
He won't listen, but his men might.
Not everybody wants to die
for someone else's home.
I need your word.
If I persuade him
to abandon the castle,
you'll grant a safe passage north.
You have my word.
You have until nightfall.
You gave it to me for a purpose.
I've achieved that purpose.
It's yours.
It will always be yours.
One last thing, Ser Jaime.
Yes, Lady Brienne?
Should I fail to persuade
the Blackfish to surrender
and if you attack the castle,
honor compels me
to fight for Sansa's kin.
Of course it does.
To fight you.
Let's hope it doesn't come to that.
Blackfish: I've said no
three times already.
I have a signed letter
from your niece Sansa Stark.
I haven't seen her
since she was a child.
I don't know her signature.
I don't know you.
And I will not surrender.
Double the guards tonight.
The Kingslayer wants to try us.
I can feel it.
As I have said,
my name is--
Yes, Brienne of Tarth.
I know your father.
- Good man.
- He always spoke highly of you.
And if he were here now, I'd tell
him the same I'm telling you.
If you think I'm abandoning
my family's seat
on the Kingslayer's word of
honor, you're a bloody fool.
Riverrun cannot stand against
the Lannisters and the Freys.
We can stand longer than your
one-handed friend thinks we can.
- He's not my friend.
- No?
Who gave you permission to cross the
siege line and enter the castle?
Who gave you that sword with
the gold lion on the pommel?
Ser Jaime kept his word
to your niece Catelyn Stark.
He sent me to find Sansa,
to help her as Catelyn wanted.
He gave me this sword to protect her.
That is what I have done
and I will continue to do
until the day I die.
She's exactly like her mother.
I don't have enough men to
help her take Winterfell.
You have more than she does.
She wants her home back.
I understand that.
But this is my home.
And if Jaime Lannister wants it,
he can bloody well take it
the way everyone else does.
Find the maester.
We need to get a raven
north to Sansa.
What should I write?
Tell her I failed.
There's to be a royal announcement?
There is.
Why wasn't I informed?
There is to be a royal announcement
in the throne room
at this very moment.
Where are you going?
To stand by my son.
Your place is in the gallery
with the other ladies of the court.
Pycelle:
Tommen:
the Faith and the Crown
are the two pillars
that hold up this world.
One collapses, so does the other.
The Father judges us all.
If you break his laws...
After conferring with His
Holiness the High Septon,
we have determined that Loras Tyrell
and Cersei Lannister's trial
will be held in
the Great Sept of Baelor
on the first day of the
Festival of the Mother.
Furthermore, after much prayer
the Crown has decided
that from this day forward,
trial by combat will be forbidden
throughout the Seven Kingdoms.
Tommen: The tradition
is a brutish one,
in order to avoid
true judgment from the gods.
will stand trial before seven septons
as it was in the earliest
days of the Faith.
Crowd:
Your Grace...
that old rumor you told me about.
My little birds investigated.
And?
Was it just a rumor
or something more?
More.
Much more.
Missandei:
I am happy.
You should both be happy as well.
Not so long ago, this city
was ready to devour itself.
Now it's like a man reborn.
I will be happy
when our queen returns.
Why don't you drink? Why don't
either of you ever drink?
Unsullied never drink.
- Why not?
- Rules.
And who made these rules?
Your former masters?
Those miserable old shits
didn't want you to be human.
Have a drink with me.
And you?
What's your excuse?
I have tried wine before.
It made me feel funny.
That's how you know it's working.
Here's to our queen.
Anyone not drinking
is disrespecting our queen.
To Daenerys Stormborn,
Mother of Dragons,
Breaker of Chains,
long may she reign.
- Long may she reign.
- Long may she reign.
Tyrion:
Tastes like it has turned.
Yes, yes.
Fermentation.
One day, after our queen has
taken the Seven Kingdoms...
I'd like to have my own vineyard.
Make my own wine.
The Imp's Delight.
Only my close friends could drink it.
Tell me a joke, Missandei of Naath.
I do not know any jokes.
Grey Worm?
Right.
Three lords
walk into a tavern--
a Stark, a Martell, and a Lannister.
but when the barkeep
brings them over,
each of them finds a fly in his cup.
The Lannister, outraged, shoves the
cup aside and demands another.
The Martell plucks the fly
out and swallows it whole.
The Stark reaches into his cup,
pulls out the fly and shouts,
"Spit it out, you wee shit.
Spit it out."
It's funnier in Westeros.
The Starks and the Lannisters,
I thought these were enemies.
Yes.
A joke is like a story, Torgo Nudho.
Not a true story, necessarily.
A story that's supposed
to make you laugh ideally.
I do.
Tell a joke.
Two translators
are on a sinking ship.
The first says,
"Do you know
how to swim?"
The second says, "No, but I can
shout for help in 19 languages."
Ah!
That is the worst joke I ever heard.
You don't even know what a joke is.
I am soldier all my life.
You think I never hear joke?
You lied to us.
I make joke.
More jokes.
I once walked into a brothel
with a honeycomb and a jackass.
- The madam says--
-
The Masters have come
for their property.
Lord Edmure.
I apologize for the way
the Freys treated you.
A man of your birth deserves better.
You have my word you'll be properly
fed and clothed from now on.
I have your word?
Oh, good.
Good, that's--
that's a fine thing.
My uncle will never
surrender the castle, ser.
Whatever game you're playing.
The Blackfish is an old man.
A good death is all he can hope for.
But you, you have a
child now, I've heard.
A son you sired
on your wedding night.
You're a potent man.
A son I've never met
born of a wife that I haven't seen
since our first night together.
You should be with them both.
I can arrange that, you realize?
Comfortable rooms for you
at Casterly Rock.
A tutor for your boy, knights to
train him to fight and to ride.
And when he comes of age,
he'll have a keep of his own.
Do you imagine yourself
a decent person?
Is that it?
After you've massacred my family.
Kept me in a cell for years.
Stolen our lands.
I'll remind you that
our houses are at war.
I'm sorry if this conflict
has inconvenienced you,
but rebelling against the
Crown does have consequences.
Says the man who shoved his
sword through his king's back.
Did I give you the impression
that this was a negotiation?
It's not.
You understand. On some
level you understand
that you're an evil man.
I'll leave the judgments to the gods.
Well, that is convenient for you.
You're a fine-looking
fellow, aren't you?
Your square jaw,
your golden armor.
Tell me, I want to know.
I truly do.
How do you live with yourself?
All of us have to believe
that we're decent, don't we?
You have to sleep at night.
How do you tell yourself
that you're decent
after everything that you've done?
I was your sister's prisoner once.
She hit me on the head with a
rock if I remember correctly.
Yeah.
She should have killed you.
Perhaps, but she didn't.
Catelyn Stark hated me
just like you hate me.
I admired her.
Far more than her husband or her son.
Do you think I care whom you
admire and whom you don't?
No, I don't, but I'm telling you
anyway because you're my prisoner.
You don't have a choice.
The love she had for her children,
I was a little awed by it.
Reminded me of my sister.
Oh.
Oh, I see.
You're a madman.
I'm not here to trade insults.
- Your sister was a strong--
- Don't talk about Cat!
- I'll talk about whomever I want.
-
She loved her children.
I suppose all mothers do,
but Catelyn and Cersei,
there's a fierceness
you don't often see.
They'd do anything
to protect their babies.
Start a war.
Burn cities to ash.
Free their worst enemies.
The things we do for love.
You didn't come here
to talk about our sisters.
That's exactly why I came here.
I love Cersei.
You can laugh at that if you want.
You can sneer.
Doesn't matter.
She needs me.
And to get back to her,
I have to take Riverrun.
I'll send for your baby boy.
And I'll launch him into
Riverrun with a catapult.
Because you don't matter
to me, Lord Edmure.
Your son doesn't matter to me.
The people in the castle
don't matter to me.
Only Cersei.
And if I have to
slaughter every Tully
who ever lived to get back to her,
that's what I'll do.
Guard:
Edmure Tully,
son of Hoster Tully
and the rightful Lord of Riverrun.
I demand entry.
Don't let him in.
He's the Lord of Riverrun.
I have to obey his commands.
He's been their captive
ever since they murdered
his king at the Red Wedding.
Why do you think the people who
murdered his king at the Red Wedding
would decide to let him come home?
Because it's a trap, you idiot.
Don't let him in.
He's my lord, my lord.
I've sworn to serve the Lord of
Riverrun and obey his commands.
You're not obeying Edmure's commands.
You're obeying the fucking
Kingslayer's commands.
Edmure:
My lord has given an order.
With a knife to his throat.
That is not a valid order.
Lower the drawbridge and
open the gate for Lord Ed--
Man:
Aye, ser.
I'll have your head before
I surrender Riverrun.
You are not lord
of this castle, my lord.
- Lower the drawbridge.
- Man #2:
Black Walder:
we've just surrendered
our most valuable prisoner.
Welcome home, my lord.
Command all the forces within the
castle to lay down their arms.
Open the gates.
- My lord--
- Your lord has given a command.
Man:
Find the Blackfish.
Put him in irons and hand
him over to the Freys.
Find him.
Go on.
Come with us.
I've run before from the Red Wedding.
I'm not running again.
This is my family home.
Your family is in the North.
Come with us.
Don't die for pride when you
can fight for your blood.
You'll serve Sansa far
better than I ever could.
Guard:
-
- Go on, now.
I haven't had a proper
sword fight in years.
I expect I'll make
a damn fool of myself.
We found the Blackfish, my lord.
Good.
Bring him to me.
He died fighting, my lord.
- I was wrong. I admit it.
- That changes nothing.
The Unsullied could mount
a defense off the beachhead.
If the slavers' forces--
No more talking from you.
Your talking gave us this.
And I have acknowledged that.
I'm trying--
You're trying to tell me
what the army should do.
You do not know
what the army should do.
All right, what should the army do?
We'll not go to the beach.
If we go to the beach, the
Masters will take the pyramid.
The pyramid is the only place
in the city we can defend.
- We stay here.
- And then?
We wait for them to come to us.
Then we fight them.
-
-
Clegane.
What the fuck you doing here?
Chasing them.
You?
Hanging them.
Any particular reason?
They're our men.
Or they were.
They attacked a nearby sept
and murdered the villagers.
Same reason.
I was helping build it.
You've got friends?
Not anymore.
They're mine.
It's the Brotherhood's good name
they've dragged through the dirt.
Fuck your name.
They're mine.
I killed you once before, Dondarrion.
Happy to do it again.
Drop that arrow, you bloody girl.
Tougher girls than you
have tried to kill me.
You can have one of them.
Two.
No, no, no.
We're not butchers.
We hang them.
Hanging?
All over in an instant.
Where's the punishment in that?
- They die.
- We all bloody die.
Except this one here.
I'll only gut one of them.
Beric:
I'll chop off one hand.
We gave you two of the three
out of respect for your loss.
That's generous.
Bunch of nancies.
There was a time I would
have killed all seven of you
just to gut these three.
You're getting old, Clegane.
He's not.
Please don't.
I'll give you anything.
Got anything to eat?
Enjoying yourself?
I prefer chicken.
You ought to join us.
We could use you.
I tried joining.
Didn't work out for me.
Clegane, we're here for a reason.
The Lord of Light is keeping
Beric alive for a reason.
He gave a failed, drunk priest
the power to bring him
back for a reason.
We are part of something
larger than ourselves.
Lots of horrible shit
in this world gets done
for something larger than ourselves.
Cold winds are rising in the North.
And you're going to go stop them?
We need good men to help us.
Last time you saw me,
you wanted to execute me.
Beric:
But the Lord of Light gave
you the power to defeat me.
- Why?
-
I beat you because I'm
better than you, Beric.
I was better than you before you
started yammering on about the Lord
and I'm better than you now.
Aye, you're probably right.
You're a fighter.
You were born a fighter.
You walked away from the fight.
How did that go?
Good and bad, young and old,
the things we're fighting
will destroy them all alike.
You can still help a lot more
than you've harmed, Clegane.
It's not too late for you.
-
-
Lady Crane?
If you'd have done your job, she
would have died painlessly.
Instead...
The Many-Faced God
was promised a name.
He must always receive what is his.
You can't change that.
I can't change that.
No one can.
And now he's been
promised another name.
- Hey!
- Get out!
- Yah!
-
-
-
-
-
Hey!
- Yah!
-
Ah!
Woman:
My basket!
It will all be over soon.
On your knees or on your feet?
Haven't we been through this already?
That won't help you.
You told her to kill me.
Yes.
And there she is.
Finally a girl is no one.
A girl is Arya Stark of Winterfell
and I'm going home.
