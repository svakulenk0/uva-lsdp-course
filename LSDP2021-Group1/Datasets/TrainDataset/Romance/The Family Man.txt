The Family Man - 25 fps
This will be the final
boarding call for flight 2...
to London, Heathrow.
Okay.
I'm not even
gonna say it, Kate.
Then it'll be
like I never left.
Okay?
Wait.
I have a really bad feeling
about this.
About the plane?
You think it's gonna crash?
Don't say that.
No. Look, I know that we've
talked about this a thousand times,
and we agreed that going to
London was the right thing to do.
But in my heart...
this feels wrong.
- Don't go, Jack.
- You mean don't go at all?
Well, what...
what about my internship?
Believe me, I know... I know what an
incredible opportunity this is for you.
- For us, Kate.
- Right, for us.
But I'm afraid that if you
get on that plane... Look.
We're at the airport. Nobody ever
thinks clearly at the airport.
So we should just trust
the decision we already made.
You've been accepted to one of the
best law schools in the country.
I've got this internship at Barclay's
Bank. We have a great plan, honey.
You wanna do something
great, Jack?
Let's flush the plan. Let's
start our lives right now, today.
I mean, I have no idea what
this life is gonna look like,
but I know that it has the both
of us in it, and I choose us.
The plan doesn't
make us great, Jack.
What we have together,
that's what makes us great.
- I love you, Kate.
- I love you too. I do.
And one year in London
is not gonna change that.
A hundred years
couldn't change that.
Experts are predicting
a mild rally in the bond market.
- Last night was incredible.
- Huh?
I said, last night was great.
You are an amazing lover.
Thanks.
You're not bad yourself.
- I wanna see you again.
- I'd like that too.
- Tonight.
- It's Christmas eve, Jack.
So? I'll pour eggnog over you.
I have to go visit
my parents out in Jersey.
Jersey? Do you have any idea
what the traffic's gonna be like?
That's why I'm taking the train.
It was nice meeting you, Jack.

Mrs. Peterson.
Hello, Jack.
You don't have to stop singing on my
account. Oh, it's because I'm shy, Betty.
So, when are you gonna leave that old
corpse, Mr. Peterson, and run away with me?
You know you could never
satisfy me the way he does.
Ah.
Merry Christmas,
Mr. Campbell.
How'd you make out
this year, Tony?
About four grand, and a bottle
of 25-year-old Scotch from 9D.
I'm putting it all in
commercial paper like you said.
Good, but just until
the deutsche mark turns.
- Thank you, Mr. Campbell.
- All right.
- Good morning, Joe.
- Merry Christmas, sir.
Campbell wants these
available. Thanks, Adelle.
Better you than me.
If Med Tech shares fall
any lower than 43,
we're in trouble
with the stock valuations.
So for God's sake, please watch what
you say to your institutional customers.
We still have almost a full day of trading
before zero hour, and I don't want any trouble.
A penny for
your thoughts, Alan.
Hmm? Oh, God, I'm sorry.
Jack, I was thinking about,
you know, Dee and the kids.
I promised I'd be home for
dinner. It's Christmas eve, Jack.
Oh, is that tonight?
You think I like being
here on Christmas eve, Alan?
No. Well, maybe.
Okay.
Okay, maybe I do have a touch of
tunnel vision this holiday season.
But in two days
we're going to announce...
one of the largest mergers
in U.S. corporate history.
When a deal like this turns up, you get
on it and you ride it till it's over.
You don't ask it for a vacation.
December 26. After that there'll be
so much money floating around here,
it'll be like Christmas
every day.
December 26, people. If you'd like to
celebrate that day, you all have my blessing.
- You're right. I'm sorry.
- I don't want you to be sorry. I want you to be excited.
I want my gift to you to be the first
gift you open this year. You know why?
Because my gift comes
with ten zeroes.
You're right.
I'm focused. I'm there.
Good man. Everybody, turn to
page 12 in your prospectus.
You have six messages. Two of them
are imperative. Whoa. I'm going home.
I'm not even here now. Good night.
Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas.
It's only 8:30. I'm disappointed.
Got some last-minute shopping to do?
You too? This holiday's about giving. I'm
giving everything I've got to this deal.
- So in a way, I'm more Christmassy than anybody.
- You're my role model, Jack.
- Oh, and Oxford called.
- Ooh, my suits are ready.
Care for a Lifesaver?
- No, thank you.
- Help yourself.
Kate Reynolds. Her assistant said you
could reach her at home after 8:00.
Kate Reynolds was
my girlfriend in college.
- I almost married her.
- You?
- Married?
- Almost married.
- And almost a broker at E.F. Hutton.
- Excuse me?
She didn't want me to go to London.
We're standing at the airport saying
good-bye, and she asked me to stay.
So you left her.
- Wasn't easy.
- Oh, stop it. I'm getting all weepy.
I took the road
less traveled, Adelle.
And look where it took ya. I'm
gonna get this gal on the phone.
Nope. You almost married this woman.
You're not even curious
why she called?
She's probably just having
a fit of nostalgia.
Lonely Christmas eve. Call the one that
got away. Why call her back and mislead her?
This happened
a very, very long time ago.
Jack Campbell still
at his desk.
Now there's
a Hallmark moment for you.
Peter, I don't see you
rushing home to trim the tree.
That's because I'm a heartless
bastard who only cares about money.
Well, you know what?
God love you for that.
Got a call
from Terry Haight.
Bob Thomas is nervous.
That'll happen when you're about to
spend $130 billion on some aspirin.
Somebody's gotta
nurse him through this.
Why are you staring
at my breasts, Peter?
- I need you, tiger.
- Where is he?
- Aspen.
- Call Aunt Irma and tell her I won't be able to make it.
You're a credit
to capitalism, Jack.
Hey, Peter, let me
ask you a question.
An old girlfriend calls you out
of the blue on Christmas eve.
- What do you do?
- You suddenly having trouble getting dates?
- Yeah.
- Leave it in the past.
Old flames are like
old tax returns...
put 'em in the file cabinet for three
years, and then you cut 'em loose.
I'll leave from my office
tomorrow in the afternoon.
Call the group. Schedule an
emergency strategy session for noon.
That'll be a nice
little holiday treat.
- Good night, Frank.
- Hey, Mr. Campbell.
Why didn't you call down?
I would have had Joe get your ride.
I'm thinking I'll walk tonight.
It's a nice night for it.
I'll send your car home
for you. That'll be fine.
- And Merry Christmas to you, sir.
- To you too.
- Eggnog?
- Yeah, dairy case. Five dollar.
Okay.
Hey, yo. Y'all do the lotto here,
right? Y'all do the lotto here?
Yeah. Cool. 'Cause I got a
winner, baby. I got a winner.
Certified, good as gold. I know lotto keep
a lot of brothers down, but not Cash Money.
Don't do me none, son,
'cause I'd be like...
Bang on the lottery! You know
what I mean? It's all good.
Relax, son. Relax. I got you
four numbers. Check it. Bust it.
That's a winner, son.
$238, B.
Cheddar coming.
- Give me my money.
- I'm sorry. Your ticket bad. You draw in the lines.
- What are you talking about, B.?
- You draw in the lines with a pencil.
I know about this.
- Yo, buster, check the ticket, son.
- No, you get out.
Yo, you ain't even looked at the ticket.
You looking at me, son. Check the ticket.
You get out now! You take
the ticket somewhere else!
Next customer in line!
You get out or I call 9-1-1.
Oh, my God!
Check the ticket, stupid.
Look at the ticket. Shit, now
I'm gonna make you call God.
That's my word. You best check that
ticket, fool! Let me see the ticket.
Was I talking to you?
Maybe I'll buy it from you.
You know, make a little business deal.
Stupid-ass white boy in $2,000 suit gets
capped trying to be a hero. News at 11:00.
That's what you wanna see? You wanna see
Cash up in here? You want me to set it, son?
Do you wanna die?
Do you want to die?
No.
Look, I'm talking about
a business deal.
Okay? I buy the ticket
from you for $200.
I take it to a store where the guy behind
the counter doesn't have a death wish.
I just made myself
a quick $38.
Like I said, it's...
it's just a business deal.
All right. Yeah.
All right.
You blew it, B.
You blew it.
The ticket was real.
Damn, you had your chance too.
Come on, Jack.
Let's get out of here.
How'd you know my name
was Jack?
I call all you guys Jack.
Here. Nice doing
business with ya.
Hey. Hey, um...
What do you want to carry
that gun around for anyway?
You're just gonna wind up
doing something you regret.
You're talking to the wrong
person about regrets, Jack.
I mean, there must be programs
out there and, um, opportunities.
Wait a minute. Are you
actually trying to save me?
This is bananas.
This man thinks
I need to be saved, yo!
Well, everybody needs something.
Yeah? Well, what
do you need, Jack?
- Me?
- You just said, everybody needs something.
I got everything I need.
Wow. It must be great being you.
I'm not saying that you'd be able to do it
without some hard work, some honest hard work,
and possibly some medicine.
You know, I'm gonna
really enjoy this.
You just remember that
you did this, Jack, okay?
You brought this on yourself.
Merry Christmas.
Mmm, ten more minutes, Jack.
It's Christmas.
# Jingle bells Santa smells
Rudolph laid an egg #
Never mind.
- Who's here?
- Rise and shine.
Don't you think
we should open some presents?
- I think you should give Mama five more minutes in bed.
- Come on, Dad. Get up.
- Can we do that?
- Yea! It's Christmas!
- It's Christmas!
- Look, your sister's jumping on the bed.
What is this dog doing on the bed?
He needs to get off the bed.
- Did Santa come?
- I don't know. We'll have to go see.
- Let's go see the presents.
- You wanna get some presents?
Mommy just needs to wake up.
Jack. Strong coffee.
Oh, Jack.
Merry Christmas, dear.
Lorraine. Ed.
Hey, Jack, you old bird dog.
Merry Christmas to ya.
Talk to him. One day a year
away from the Ponderosa.
- I don't think that's asking too much.
- This is who I am.
Tell her, Jack, for God's sake. You're
the only one around here that gets me.
- I need some eggnog.
- 'Course you do, sweet thing.
It's almost 8:00 in the morning.
- Excuse me.
- Where you going, Jack?
- Josh, Annie, giddyup!
- Where's my car? Where's my Ferrari?
- What?
- Where's my Ferrari?
What the hell are you talking... What's
he talking about? You got a Ferrari?
Let me borrow your car and then
I promise I'll have it returned.
My Caddy?
Drive your own damn car.
Oh, just let him borrow your
precious Cadillac, for God sakes.
There's a perfectly good minivan
sitting out there in the driveway. Here.
What the hell's wrong
with him anyway?
- Tony, thank God!
- Sorry, pal. Entrance is for residents and guests only.
What? What are
you talking about?
Jack Campbell, penthouse "C."
What's the matter with you?
Mrs. Peterson, I think there's
something wrong with our man Tony here.
Who is this man?
Oh, come on. What is going
on with you two this morning?
Is this like a, uh...
a Christmas joke?
"Who is this man?" Well, we're on
the co-op board together, Betty.
And we fought side by side
for garbage disposals.
And every morning we exchange
quasi-sexual witty banter. Ok?
Shall I call the cops?
I'm gonna call the cops.
No, I'm gonna call the cops!
You're scaring me.
- No, no, no, no.
- Thank you for not calling the cops.
Now, I'm going upstairs, I'm gonna
get some sleep. Then I'll be fine.
Sleep you shall. Noblesse oblige
isn't dead. Not yet anyway.
Let's, um... Let's get you some help. Surely
there's a shelter somewhere in this city.
A shelter?
Hey, hey, are you
smacked out of your head?
I'm the richest man in this building!
I've got twice the square footage you have!
- And I'm going upstairs.
- Take a walk, pal.
Oh, not cool.
Not cool!
You wanna get cute?
Get cute.
I'm gonna go to my office. I'm gonna file
a complaint to the manager of the building.
I'm gonna have you fired, Tony. And, Mrs.
Peterson, you're on notice with the co-op board!
So you better just stop whatever
this is that you're doing!
Oh, come on!
Frank, you won't believe what's been
happening to me. Is Adelle here yet?
- Hold it right there.
- Where's Mintz?
The building is closed, pal.
You have to come back tomorrow.
Frank, why do I feel the need to remind
you that I'm Jack Campbell, President?
I don't care who you are. It's Christmas,
and like I told you, the building is closed.
I don't think
you heard me correctly.
I'm Jack Campbell.
Jack Campbell!
President!
Have a nice holiday, man.
- That's my car!
- Hi, Jack.
- You stole my car.
- I know this whole thing is really bizarre to you...
and you're feeling
quite shocked, but just hop in.
I'll explain everything
to you, okay?
Come on.
Come on.
You're probably gonna wanna
buckle up, Jack. This thing moves.
- What's happening to me?
- Breathe into the bag, Jack.
This kind of thing makes a lot of guys
have to throw up. I seen it happen before.
So if you feel the urge, you roll
down the window and do it out there.
Try not to get
so worked up, Jack.
After all, you brought
this on yourself.
Brought what on myself?
I didn't do anything!
"I got everything I need."
That sound familiar?
You mean 'cause you thought I was
cocky, I'm now on a permanent acid trip?
Bag yourself, Jack.
Oh, my God! Ah!
The way you intervened in that store last
night, you did a good thing there, Jack.
I mean, it was incredibly impressive
all the way across the board...
to the upper echelons
of the organization.
Please just tell me what's
happening to me in plain English...
without the mumbo-jumbo.
- This is a glimpse, Jack.
- A glimpse?
A glimpse of what?
You're gonna have to figure that out
for yourself and you got plenty of time.
- How much time?
- As much time as it takes,
which in your case is probably
gonna be considerable.
Okay, look, look. I-I-I just
want my life back, okay?
Now, what's it gonna take?
You wanna talk turkey?
Let's talk turkey.
How much money?
- It doesn't work like that, and I can't tell you why.
- Why not?
Because you have to figure
this thing out for yourself.
Are you listening to me? Figure it
out, figure it out. Figure out what?
- Let it come to you, man.
- I don't have time for this right now.
- I'm in the middle of a deal.
- Well, you're working on a new deal now, baby.
What's this?
Open it.
What is it,
some kind of a signal?
Will you come
whenever I ring it?
Now you gotta
get out of the car, Jack.
But what do I do? I'm sorry. I
can't spend any more time with you.
- I got some other business I gotta take care of.
- No, y-y-you did this to me.
You can't just leave me like this.
Okay. Look, you wanna get some air?
Let's get outside, get some air.
We'll walk and I'll explain
everything to you, okay?
- Thanks, man.
- Sure.
Excuse me. Do you know
where Merrison Street is?
Jeannie.
- I found Jack.
- Oh, there you are, stranger.
Where you been?
You look terrible.
Truth is, I expected you.
Kate called and asked
if I knew where you were, so...
Oh, I put the Barcalounger in the center
of the room. It's throwing everybody off.
What do you think?
It's a great room.
Great room.
You and me, buddy,
we know how to live, huh?
Come on.
Come on, Jack.
Come on...
Come on, buddy.
Take your seat.
Are you okay?
I mean, you take off Christmas morning and
you don't tell anyone where you're going.
- We're friends?
- Talk to me.
I'm having kind of a bad day.
You know, I read somewhere that the
suicide rate doubles during the holiday.
What am I saying that for?
You don't wanna hear that. Come on.
Is it...
Is it trouble at work?
I... I don't think so.
Well, it's not Kate, is it?
You see, huh? It's like we're
inside each other's heads.
Kate's my wife.
Just keep saying it over and over again,
Jack, like a mantra. Keep saying it.
Look, you know,
you fit the profile exactly...
in your 30s, house, kids,
financial responsibilities.
You start thinking this
isn't the life I dreamt about.
Where's the romance,
you know?
Where's the joie de vivre?
Suddenly every lingerie ad
in the Newark Star-Ledger...
represents a life
that you can't have.
It's just two kids, right?
Come on. Come on.
All right, sometimes it feels like you
gave up the whole world. I know that.
But look what you got.
Look at that: four bedrooms,
two-and-a-half baths,
a partially finished basement.
And good kids.
Look. You know what?
You probably don't wanna
hear this right now.
But remember last summer when I almost had
that thing with Arnie, Jr. 's speech therapist?
You remember what
you said to me?
You said, "Don't screw up
the best thing in your life...
just because you're a little
unsure about who you are."
Okay?
Go get 'em, tiger.
Could you hold on a second?
Um, never mind because...
because he just walked in.
Thank you. Thank you.
Do you... have any idea
what you put us through today?
You walk out of here
at 7:30 in the morning.
You don't tell me where you're
going, or even that you're going.
And I don't see you
till hours later?
I called all of our friends. I had
the state troopers looking for you.
I was on the phone with the
hospital, for God's sakes.
What kind of man leaves his family on Christmas
morning without a word about where he's going?
- What kind of a man does that, Jack?
- I don't know.
Could you... Could you please
stop yelling at me?
- Where were you?
- I was in the city.
The city?
New York City?
- Yeah.
- Why?
- Because that's where I live.
- Don't start, Jack. Don't.
Look, you don't understand.
I... I... I woke up
this morning here.
And this is very strange
because...
this isn't my house.
And those aren't my kids.
I'm not Dad.
I- I-I'm not a dad.
You're not my wife.
You know what, Jack.
It's not funny this time...
because I am really mad.
I mean, really mad.
I mean it.
I don't even...
What...
What's that?
I like it.
Thanks, Dad.
That's mine. Hey,
I need that back.
She took my bell.
You missed the whole thing...
the pancakes and the presents.
You spent six hours putting
that bike together for Annie,
and then you didn't even get to see
the look on her face when she opened it.
You missed Christmas, Jack.
I'm sorry.
You know, we don't even
have enough time for this.
And at least you're okay.
I'm okay, we're okay.
But you've gotta get dressed for the
Thompson party. And you are not wearing that.
I don't care how hilarious
you think it is.
Party? No, I'm not
going to a party.
You look forward to this party all
year. What is it with you today?
Believe me, Kate. I really don't
think that going to a party...
is the right move for me
at the present time.
Okay, fine. You know what? Then
you just do whatever you wanna do.
- What are you doing?
- Telling my mother she doesn't
have to stay with the kids.
- Why not?
- Because you'll be here.
I'll be ready in ten minutes.
This is... This is
just subpar.
# Oh, the weather outside
is frightful #
Lance, here you go.
Excuse me.
# Let it snow, let it snow
Let it snow #
# It doesn't show
signs of stopping ##
- Kate. Jack.
- Evelyn.
Come in. Hey, everybody,
Kate and Jack are here.
- Hey!
- Jeannie.
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.
Jack, Merry Christmas.
Whoops.
Here.
- So, like the dress?
- Oh, it's lovely.
I thought I saw you notice
it at the kids' recital.
It's lovely.
It's lovely.
There he is.
- Hey, Jack. Happy holidays, man.
- Yeah.
Jack, come on over.
Hey, Jack.
Cheers, baby.
- You guys see Van Horn last night?
- Thirty-two points.
- That kid's gonna take the Nets to the championship.
- The Nets? Are you kidding?
They suck.
But they're due.
They're certainly due.
So, tomorrow's
the big day, Jackie.
Okay. Why?
My triple bypass.
I'm going under the knife
tomorrow. I told you that, right?
- Triple bypass.
- Yeah.
You really think you should
be eating all that?
Figure I'm going in
for a cleaning tomorrow.
Might as well load up on the
fried stuff tonight, right?
That's good thinking, Bill.
Have another drink.
Some fried pork, mashed potatoes.
He'll be dead by morning.
- How 'bout a cigar, Jack?
- Oh, no, thank you. I'm cutting down.
- Come on. They're American made, not Cuban.
- Oh, really?
Come on.
- Very nice.
- I thought you'd like 'em.
Superb.
- How 'bout you, Arnie?
- I'm all right. Thanks.
- Finger food?
- No, thank you. I'm fine.
Come on. Soon as I put 'em
down, you're gonna grab a couple.
- You always do.
- No, I'm okay.
Let me. They will melt
in your mouth.
Yeah.
- Good?
- Fabulous.
At the end of this whole thing, she
made me this hand-embroidered sweater.
- It was really lovely.
- How nice.
So I'm slipping it on and I notice that
she's misspelled the word "lawyers."
I spent the entire
day walking around...
with a sweater that said,
"Nonprofit layers do it for free."
So you're a lawyer?
A nonprofit lawyer?
Probono.
- You don't get paid at all? Nobody makes a dime?
- Jack?
"Anyhoo..."
I better go wake my mom.
There you go.
Uh, I don't think so.
- She's your dog, Jack.
- No, she's not.
You're right.
She's the kids' dog.
Maybe we should go wake Josh
and make him walk her.
If you take a dump sometime in this century,
then we could go home where it's warm.
If I can even remember
how to get home.
You remember,
don't you, girl?
Hello?
# Am I hard enough
Am I rough enough #
# Am I rich enough #
Hello?
# I'm not too blind #
# To see #
- Hey!
- What?
Oh. That baby's crying.
And?
Don't give me that look, Jack.
Tuesday's your day and you know it.
And listen, try and get Josh
to day care on time, okay?
# You're a pretty, pretty
pretty, pretty #
# Such a pretty girl ##
All right.
Holy Mother of God!
You're not really
my dad, are you?
No, I'm not.
I work on Wall Street, you
know, with the big buildings.
I live in an apartment
with a doorman.
And I can buy
almost anything I want.
This isn't my life.
It's just a glimpse.
Where's my real dad?
I don't know.
But don't worry.
He loves you, and I'm sure
he'll be back very soon.
What are you doing?
They did a pretty good job.
Who did?
The aliens
in the mother ship.
You look just like him.
Oh, thanks.
Slightly better looking
though, right?
Oh, no, you're not gonna
start crying, are you?
I don't think I could
really deal with that right now.
Do you like kids?
On a case by case basis.
Do you know how
to make chocolate milk?
I... I think I could
figure it out.
Promise you won't kidnap
me and my brother...
and plant stuff in our brains?
Sure.
Welcome to Earth.
# We're going to the zoo
zoo, zoo #
# Look at all the crocodiles
swimming in the... ##
This is where babies go when
their parents are at work.
Check.
Just push the red button.
Okay.
Do I get a receipt or something?
I have winter camping till 4:00
and ballet class until 5:30.
- 5:30. Okay.
- And try not to be late...
- 'cause kids don't like to be the
last one picked up.
- Got it. Good tip.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Hey, Annie. Where do I go now?
- Big Ed's.
Big Ed's Tires?
Why?
- 'Cause you work there.
- You mean I sell tires.
That's what I do.
I'm a tire salesman.
Good Lord!
- Morning, Jack.
- Hi.
- Good morning, Jack.
- Hi.
Hey, Jack.
Jack, my boy.
Hey, guess who I played
bridge with two nights ago.
Hell, you'll never guess.
One Sydney Potter. That's Sydney
Potter, C.E.O., Buy Rite Transport.
Only the third biggest
trucking outfit in the state.
"Anyhoo," he's looking
for a new parts supplier.
We can handle volume
like that, now can't we, Jack?
I'm gonna have to
get back to you on that, Ed.
Right on.
Right on.
Excuse me. Uh, do I... do I have a
private office somewhere in the building?
Sure, Jack.
Where is it?
Oh, uh, it's...
it's right back...
right back there.
Thank you.
Oh, no.
You must've needed this
every day.
What are you smiling about?
Eighty-eight?
I was in London in 1988.
You never went to London.
Jack, you're needed in mag
wheels. Customer waiting.
I was the number one junior sales
associate for E.F. Hutton in 1988.
- Did you know that?
- Uh, no. No, I didn't.
That's great.
That's the kind of thing you
could really build on, you know?
- Uh-huh. Yeah.
- I mean, sales has always been a feeder for M&A. Always.
Uh-huh.
Well, look, here we are.
The mag wheels. Mag wheels.
Oh. So.
Hey, Jack, um,
are you sure you're okay?
Well, I'm just a little confused
right now about why I work here.
Uh...
I just started here
last Tuesday, so...
The closing tip was
a mildly bullish plus-76.
Much of the market's action today was
fueled by the latest round of merger mania...
to hit Wall Street...
when Global Health Systems and Med Tech
Pharmaceutical announced their intentions...
to join forces in a massive
$122 billion stock swap deal,
the largest ever
in the health care industry.
When asked about the possible
anti-competitive implications,
Global chairman Bob Thomas
referred reporters...
to P.K. Lassiter & Company president
Alan Mintz, the architect behind the deal.
- That's my deal!
- Ironically, Mintz first met Thomas at a Lamaze class.
- What?
- While coaching their pregnant
wives, Mintz and Thomas...
struck up a dialog, and two months
later, the deal with Med Tech was born.
He wasn't the architect!
I'm the architect!
Labor department officials announced today
that 275,000 new jobs have been created.
The kids are asleep.
The kids, hon.
Honey.
Sweetheart, I said
the kids are asleep.
That's just great. Those little
monkeys can be a real handful.
Hey, I was watching that.
Not tonight.
Please leave
my socks alone.
Wait.
- You want me.
- That is the general idea, yeah.
Oh, well, maybe we should
grab a bottle of wine first.
Kind of break the ice.
Yeah, that's very funny.
Look, it's 10:30.
By 11:00 you're gonna be
snoring like a monster,
but that's very sweet.
I'll remember that
for next time.
Whatever you say...
honey.
Yeah.
Oh, God, you're beautiful.
Thanks, Jack.
No, I'm serious.
You're really stunning.
This is good stuff.
I want you to keep this up.
You were always a very pretty girl in
college. There's no question about that.
But this...
You've really grown
into a beautiful woman.
How can you do that?
What?
Look at me like you haven't seen
me every day for the last 13 years.
Okay, wait. Don't move.
Don't look.
Stay right there.
I got something.
# The world was on fire #
# No one could save me
but you #
Good night, sweetheart.
# Strange what desire #
# Will make foolish people do ##
Okay, we're almost
out of here.
Mary Janes, Mommy.
You promised.
That's right. I did
promise. Okay. All right.
We're gonna stop at the
kids' shoe department first,
and then I gotta pick up my
watch from the battery store.
Then I'm gonna go
to the linen store.
Why don't we go
to all the stores?
Every single store in this
god forsaken shopping mall.
Wouldn't that be exciting?
You know what?
Why don't I take the kids,
and you just stay here and hang
out in the men's department?
Come on, hon.
It's perfect for your frame.
Why don't you try it on?
I might want to take an
inch out of the back. Okay.
Lengthen the sleeve.
You look amazing in that suit.
I mean, really... wow!
Off the charts, great.
It's an unbelievable thing.
Wearing this suit actually makes
me feel like a better person.
I'm gonna buy it.
It's $2,400.
Are you out of your mind?
Come on, let's go.
- She got those shoes.
- Those shoes were $25.
Come on.
Take it off, all right?
We'll go to the food court and get
one of those funnel cakes you like.
Daddy's a crazy guy.
No.
No.
Do you have any idea
what my life is like?
- Excuse me?
- I wake up in the morning covered in dog saliva.
I drop the kids off,
spend eight hours
selling tires retail.
Retail, Kate.
I pick the kids up,
walk the dog,
which, by the way,
carries the added bonus...
of carting away
her monstrous crap.
I play with the kids,
take out the garbage,
get six hours of sleep
if I'm lucky.
Then everything starts
all over again.
So what's in it for me?
Wh-Where are my Mary Janes?
You know, it's sad to hear that your
life is such a disappointment to you.
I can't believe it isn't
a disappointment to you!
Jesus, Kate, I could have been a
thousand times the man I became.
I could have been one of
the richest... Forbes...
How could you do this to me? How could
you let me give up on my dreams like this?
Really, I want to know.
Who are you?
All right, look.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I was such
a saint before...
and I'm such a prick now!
But maybe I'm just not...
the same guy that I was
when we got married.
You know what?
Maybe you're not.
Because the Jack Campbell I married
would not need a $2,400 suit...
to feel better about his life.
But I'm telling you, if that's
what it's gonna take, then buy it.
Jesus! We'll take the money
out of the kids' college fund.
Forget it.
We'll get a funnel cake.
It'll be the highlight
of my week.
Listen, I'm really sorry
about that back in the store.
I don't want to fight with you.
I just sometimes wonder how
we ended up here, you know.
I mean, back in college,
d-did you see us here?
Life has thrown us a few
surprises. I'll give you that.
It really has, hasn't it?
Yeah. So, if you had to, what would
you say was the biggest surprise?
Just out of curiosity.
I'm just asking.
- Well, Annie, for one.
- Surprise, we're pregnant.
Yeah, that must have been.
I mean, that... that was.
That was a very unexpected moment.
- What are you gonna do?
- I think it turned out all right, don't you?
Yeah.
I really like Annie.
Well, good, Jack.
Maybe we'll keep her.
No, I love her.
I love Annie.
I'm just...
We had a lot of good times,
didn't we?
Do you remember the place on
Charles Street where we used to go?
Charles Street?
In the village?
When we were living
in Greenwich Village.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Great times. Great place.
Why did we ever leave?
You can't really raise a kid
in an apartment in the village.
Then there was the whole trek out to
the hospital. That didn't help either.
You were great. I mean, surviving
the heart attack was one thing.
- You had a heart attack?
- Hey, Jack, stop that.
'Cause I am...
I'm still mad at you.
Who knows what would have happened
if you hadn't stepped in at the store?
That's why I work for Big Ed.
That's why I work
for Big Ed. Yeah.
So we had a baby,
Big Ed had a heart attack.
Bought that house, and I've
been working for him ever since.
Sayonara, Wall Street.
Our life in a nutshell.
If you want to
look at it that way.
How would you look at it?
A great success story.
What do you say, Jack? Show 'em how
to do it, baby. Jack, we need a strike.
- Damn!
- Jesus, Jack. What are you doing?
It's a league match. Where's your
follow through? Where's your stance?
You know what?
I'm doing the best I can.
It's okay, Jack.
Why am I so competitive
all the time?
You can still pick up that
spare. Crack 'em, Jack!
Here we go.
Hurt 'em.
You're Jack Campbell.
You're better than the sport.
You shot the rapids in Kanai.
You ran with the bulls in Pamplona.
You've jumped out of an airplane over
the Mojave Desert, for Christ's sake.
You can do this.
You can do this.
Yes! Victorious!
Huh? All right!
High five!
- You're up.
- Go get 'em.
Hi, Jack.
- Evelyn, right?
- Very funny.
I saw you on lane 20.
You got the flu or something?
Something like that, yeah.
Need a nurse?
Are you a nurse?
If that's what you want.
Hey, wait a minute.
Um, don't run away.
Are we...
Are we what, Jack?
Well...
Is there something
going on between us?
Are we finally being honest?
It would help me if we were.
Okay. You're right.
We've been dancing
around this for years.
Here goes.
When I get dressed for a party,
and I know you're gonna be there,
let's just say I don't go strapless
because my husband likes it.
I've got six sets of snow
tires piled up in my garage,
and I won't even drive
in the snow.
And our kids
just happen to be...
in the same ballet class
every year.
So, if you're asking whether
I'd like it to be more,
the answer's yes.
Kate would never have to know.
Do I have your number?
Steve's out of town
with the kids this weekend.
Why don't you just stop by?
Hey, Jack.
You're all flushed.
I feel good. Guess that
No. I just saw
Evelyn Thompson.
She's relentless.
She wants to have
an affair with me.
- She said that?
- Pretty much.
What is it about you?
So... if you would write
her exact address down there.
You have a pen? Please. Whoa,
whoa, whoa. Hold on a second.
You're not actually thinking
about cheating on Kate?
Well, it wouldn't really
be cheating, Arnie.
It's complicated.
Maybe I haven't been as good a consigliere
as you've been to me, but hear me out on this.
A little flirtation is harmless,
but you're dealing
with fire here, man.
The Fidelity Bank and Trust
is a tough creditor.
You make a deposit somewhere
else, they close your account...
forever, all right?
Arnie, I don't want
your head to explode,
but I'm telling you,
those rules don't apply to me.
I-I'm not even...
I'm not talking about rules.
I'm talking about...
Y-You're...
There isn't a guy in Union County
who wouldn't give his left nut...
to be with Kate, all right?
She's amazing, and you're
gonna fuck it up.
Just think about that,
all right?
Hey, honey.
How was the game?
Long and boring
and generally pretty sad.
Arnie seemed to enjoy it.
Sort of.
Hey, where's that chocolate cake?
- Do you mean this chocolate cake?
- That's my piece.
I was saving it because I got nauseated by
that precooked mini-mall rotisserie chicken.
Mmm. Mmm.
It's good.
Give me that cake.
No way.
- Come on.
- I'm sorry.
It's too important to me.
I want that cake!
- You want this cake?
- I want it.
Thank you.
- It's good, right?
- Mm-hmm.
Oh, God!
Are the kids asleep?
- Say it to me, Jack.
- What?
You know what I like to hear.
I know, baby. I know
what you like to hear.
Tell me.
Tell me, tell me.
You're a bad girl, baby.
You make me so hot.
What?
Not it?
Nice, Jack.
- What?
- Sweeping me off my feet.
You make me hot.
What do you say, everyone?
- This is a little birthday party for Katie.
- Happy birthday, Katie.
Good to see you kids still
together. Hello, kids.
Happy birthday. Very exciting.
Evelyn, you look tremendous.
- Thank you.
- Look what happens when I do that.
- Jack? The man.
- Yes. Yes.
Do you have anything to say to your
lovely wife on the day of her birth?
- You happy she was born?
- Hey, hey! Today's your birthday?
- That's funny, Jack.
- You know what?
Wow, your birthday.
It's... You're my wife.
You are my wife.
Today is your birthday.
Well, actually, I do have one
thing that I want to say to you.
And God,
I hope you like it.
Bill?
- Oh, no.
- Yes. You hit it, Bill.
You wore that shirt last year,
by the way. Just so you know.
# Many guys
have come to you #
- # With a line that wasn't true #
- Oh!
# And you passed them by #
# Passed them by #
# Now you're in the centering
and their lines don't mean a thing #
# Why don't you let me try #
# Let me try #
# Now, I don't wear
a diamond ring #
# I don't even have
a song to sing #
# All I know is
la-la-la-la la-la-la-la-la #
# Means I love you #
# La-la-la-la
la-la-la-la-la #
# Means I love you #
Ahh!
Sweet.
# The things I am saying
are true-ooh-ooh #
# And the way
I explain it to you #
- Get down, Jack.
# Yes, to you #
# Listen to me
La-la-la-la #
# La-la-la-la-la means #
# I love you #
# Ohh #
# La-la-la-la
la-la-la-la-la #
# Means I love you ##
Happy birthday, sweetheart.
Yeah.
Yeah, Jack!
There's love in the air.
He loves her.
It's official. There's love.
Mmm. Come on,
it's time to get up, honey.
Go, go.
Good morning, Joshie.
Happy anniversary, honey.
Now, listen, before you do whatever
crazy stunt you've got planned,
I want you to open mine first.
Maybe I should wait.
No! Come on! Come on,
come on, come on. Open it.
Zeena?
I found it at an outlet store.
Look, I know it's a knock off, but
I think it's gonna look great on you.
You...
Ah, enjoy it, sweetheart.
Uh...
Yeah, uh... You're probably
expecting something from me.
Um, here's the thing.
I hadn't really planned on giving
you your anniversary gift...
until tonight.
You know, anniversary's
good all day.
What are you talking about?
You can never wait all day.
You can't even wait till
it's light out. Come on!
I know. I know.
That's me. It's true.
And... But, um,
it's funny.
You forgot.
You actually forgot
our anniversary.
I'll fix it. I'll go out right
now and I'll get you something.
I'll make it right.
Let me know if there's enough
chocolate in there, sweetheart.
- Mm, not bad.
- Good.
I should have warned you.
Dad always does something really
special for the anniversary.
Like what? One year he
had a star named after her.
He had a star
named after her?
Well, that's nice, but
isn't that a little... corny?
Mom liked it.
Maybe there's a jewelry store at the mall. I
can pick her up a pair of earrings or something.
That's good, but...
you did forget
the anniversary.
That's right. That is a
major oversight. Okay, okay.
So, if I'm Kate, I can't
afford the finer things.
My husband's career is definitely
a crushing disappointment to me.
I'm trapped in suburbia.
Did he ever take her
to the city?
Now you're getting
the hang of it.
Jack, can we afford
this place?
I'm taking my baby out for our
anniversary. Damn the costs.
We'll have the Terrine of Quail Breast
with Shiitake Mushrooms to start.
Then the Veal Medallions
in Raspberry Truffle Sauce.
And the Sea Scallops
with Pureed Artichoke Hearts.
Very good, sir. And may I say,
those are all excellent selections.
You may. Also, we'll have
a bottle of Lafite, '82.
Honey, that's an $800
bottle of wine.
We'll just have some red wine
by the glass.
You are so not
off the hook yet, Slick.
But I'm getting close, right?
You wanna dance?
I-I don't think
there's dancing here, Jack.
Sure, there is.
Come on.
Not bad for a tire salesman
from New Jersey.
I have my moments.
You gotta try one of these.
Ahh.
God, I miss that taste.
I need to tell you something.
Okay.
I think it may help us,
but there's a slight chance
it could make things worse.
I'm living someone else's...
I feel like I'm living
someone else's life.
I remember I used to
walk to work, and, uh,
I had a warm bialy
in my hand,
and a hot cup of coffee
from Dean & Deluca,
the crisp feeling
of The Wall Street Journal,
the smell of leather
from my briefcase.
I used to be so sure about
everything, confident.
You know, I-I knew
exactly who I was...
and what I wanted.
And then one morning,
I woke up...
and suddenly
it was all different.
- Worse, do you mean?
- No.
Well, maybe a few things,
but mostly just different.
And it's okay.
But I never used to
be like this, Kate.
I was the guy
who had it all figured out.
I had no doubts.
I had no regrets.
And now?
Now I don't.
I don't have it all figured out.
Me neither.
But you always seem so certain.
Do you think there aren't
mornings when I wake up...
and wonder, "What the hell
am I doing in New Jersey?"
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- My office is a dump.
I answer my own phone,
and you seen my paycheck.
Your paycheck is a disgrace
to paychecks.
Can you imagine a life...
where everything was just easy?
You know, where you ask for things,
and people just bring them to you?
It's wonderful.
I think about it too.
I do.
I wonder about what kind of life I
would have had if I hadn't married you.
And?
Then I realize I've just erased all the
things in my life that I'm sure about.
You and the kids.
Good things.
Yeah.
What are you sure about?
I'm sure that right now,
there's nowhere else I'd
rather be than here with you.
Oh.
Oh, Jack.
You like it?
This is beautiful.
You know champagne
makes me do crazy things.
I'll just fill yours
up to the top.
I don't know how you did it,
Hoss, but you pulled it off.
- I'm out of the doghouse?
- Way out.
Happy anniversary, sweetheart.
You may even get lucky
tonight, Jack.
You're so beautiful.
I already told you
you were gonna get lucky.
My God.
All this time,
I never stopped loving you.
That's all I wanted to hear.
I'm gonna wear the usual today.
What are you thinking?
You want to come to work
with Dad, help me sell tires?
It's fun.
I'm pretty good at it.
Who's this? Who's that?
Who is that?
Who's on that tie?
That's Grandpa.
Yes.
Jack!
Mmm.
Have a great day.
For the money, this is hands
down the best radial we carry.
Okay.
I guess I'll take 'em.
You won't regret it.
Tommy.
Would you set Mr. Collin up with four
B.F. Goodrich G-Force T.A.'s?
Give him ten percent off for
having the best costume. Thank you.
You bet. Right this way, sir. Follow me.
Tell me, does the tire
smell good?
Remember our
Valentine's Day special:
balance and alignment for free!
How are you doing today?
It just blew out on me.
Do you have a tire like that?
I seem to have
some sort of a blowout here.
- Why don't you let me take this one, Kenny?
- Okay, chief.
Peter Lassiter.
- Do I know you?
- Not exactly.
I've seen you on CNBC.
You look taller in real life.
Truth is, Mintz was so busy
timing his wife's breathing,
he didn't realize that Med Tech needed
Global more than the other way around.
Ten days, two weeks tops, they would
have approached you with an offer.
I'm willing to bet anything it
would have been 130 billion, not 122.
The trouble is, Peter, you had
a pussycat running the show.
What you needed was a Doberman.
I'm impressed.
I really am.
Now, about my car.
Sure. We're gonna have to
special order that tire,
so it'll be ready
in a couple of days.
All right.
This is my office address.
Why don't you drop off
the car yourself?
We're really more of a boutique
operation, as you can see.
But you're not interested in
boutique dollars. I get it.
He's expecting you,
Mr. Lassiter.
Alan, this is Jack Campbell,
the one I was telling you about.
- Of course. Jack. Hi.
- Mr. Mintz.
No, just call me Alan. We like to
cultivate a very casual atmosphere here.
- I can see that.
- What can I tell you? Do you have kids?
Uh, actually, yes.
Two of them. Good ones.
Great, great.
Why don't you have a seat?
Peter mentioned to me that
you're an avid CNBC watcher.
But he didn't say whether you had
any actual Wall Street experience.
Um, I was a sales associate
at E.F. Hutton.
A broker, really?
And now you're in
the tire business?
That's right.
And auto supply.
In the retail end, I understand.
We get about 60 percent of our
business from automotive service.
And do you mind me asking what kind
of sales you did in the last year?
Just ball park. We did
And what do you project
for this year?
I think we're gonna have
a banner year.
Sales are up almost 20 percent
in the first quarter,
and we just landed a major
trucking company account.
You did? That's great. So that puts
you just a tad over two million?
That's right. And that would
make us number one in our market.
Excuse me. I'm gonna get
a glass of water.
Look, I know our paltry
little $2 million in sales...
is about what you spend a year
on office supplies.
And some regional trucking company
account is nothing compared...
- to a multi-billion-dollar merger.
- No, no, no.
- I'm not trying to knock the tire business.
- It's okay, Alan. I get it.
I'm in your shoes, I'm thinking
the same thing, but here's the deal.
Business is business.
Wall Street, Main Street.
It's all a bunch of people
getting up in the morning,
trying to figure out how they're
going to send their kids to college.
It's just people,
and I know people.
- Oh, I'm sure you do.
- Take you, for instance, Alan.
You have a certain energy about
you, an active kind of energy.
I wouldn't be surprised if you
drank about 16 Diet Cokes a day.
You're an excellent father, but you feel
guilty about the time you spend away from home.
You drink bourbon, but you
offer your clients Scotch.
And your wife
decorated this office.
He certainly seems
to have your number.
You're a little tougher,
Peter.
For one thing,
you like expensive things.
That's easy.
You've seen my car.
You smoke Hoyo de Monterreys.
You're a Scotch man, single malt,
not because it's trendy but because
you've been doing it for 40 years...
and you like to stay
with what works.
You have two great loves
in your life: your horses...
and this company.
And you're a man who prides himself
in finding talent in unusual places.
- How would you know that?
- Because I'm here.
I'm prepared to do whatever
it takes to get this job.
I'll start wherever
I have to start.
I'll park cars if I have to.
The biggest part of judging character
is knowing yourself, and I know this:
I can do this job.
I can.
Give me a chance, Peter.
I won't let you down.
Alan, why don't you
show Jack around?
This is our war room. We did seven
major deals in here last year,
three of them... hostile.
- Seven?
- Yeah. You get a kind of a feeling from...
Can we cut the shit here for a minute?
Where did you get that information?
Did you go through his wallet?
Did you surf some Net?
It doesn't really matter because that
circus act you pulled back there...
may have dazzled Lassiter, but
it doesn't cut any shit with me.
Even if you get this job,
which I highly doubt,
let me just give you
a word of warning.
Peter Lassiter gets tired of his
pet projects very, very quickly.
I've got that big office because I prove
myself to him year after year after year.
Nobody is gonna come in here
and turn the old man's head,
especially not some tire
salesman from New Jersey.
So if you're cautious
and you're quiet,
you watch yourself,
stay away from Lassiter,
maybe I'll think about keeping you
on here after he gets bored with you.
Do we understand each other?
Alan!
God, you really are different.
- Excuse me?
- I mean, wow!
I'm impressed. I'm impressed.
Good for you.
Are we understanding
each other?
Yes, Alan, I understand you.
- Okay then.
- Good.
- Good.
- Okay. Okay.
Alan!
Keep your eyes closed.
Hold on.
Go ahead.
Open your eyes.
Welcome to Xanadu.
It's pretty incredible,
isn't it?
It's like a museum.
Look around.
So what's the big surprise?
You didn't rent this
for the weekend, did you?
Think... bigger.
For the week?
This place is a perk, Kate.
A perk?
For what?
A company called P.K. Lassiter
Investment House...
uses it to attract
new executives.
I'm going into arbitrage, honey.
It turns out
I have a knack for it.
Jack, what are you
talking about?
I'll be making twice what I
make now, plus a hefty bonus.
That's just to start. And we
can live in this apartment...
practically rent free...
until we find a place of our own.
Are you out of your mind?
I don't think so.
This is gonna be a better life for all of us.
We can put Annie and Josh into private schools.
Annie goes to
a great school, Jack.
I'm talking about the best
schools in the country here.
What could you possibly be
thinking about? What about my job?
Well, this is New York City. It's like
the needy people capital of the world.
Your Jersey clients aren't a tenth as
pathetic as the ones you could find here.
I can't even believe you're talking
about moving back into the city.
I thought the reason we left was because
we didn't want to raise the kids here.
No. No. This is the
center of the universe.
If I were living in Roman times,
I would live in Rome. Where else?
"Today America is the Roman
empire. New York is Rome itself."
- John Lennon.
- Jack!
Okay, you know something? I'm
detecting, like, a funky tension here.
This was supposed to be a happy day,
so guess what? I don't need this.
We don't have to live here.
Forget it.
- I'll commute. I'll drive to work.
- God!
In traffic, it's over an hour each
way. That's three hours every day.
- When are you ever going to see the kids?
- Kate.
You're not understanding me.
I'm talking about a
perfect life, a great life.
Everything we pictured when we
were young. The whole package.
You said so yourself.
Life has thrown us a few surprises,
so we made sacrifices.
Well, guess what?
Now I can finally get us back
on track. I can do that, Kate.
I want to do that.
I need to do that as a man!
For all of us.
Please just think about this
for one second.
No more lousy restaurants.
No more clipping coupons.
No more shoveling snow.
Then get a goddamn
snowblower, Jack!
Don't go get a new career
without even telling me about it!
And don't... don't take Annie
out of a school she loves.
Don't move us out of a house
we've become a family in.
You're... You're...
Don't you see? I'm talking
about us finally having a life...
that other people envy.
Oh, Jack.
They already do envy us.
From London to New York.
I came back.
When you got on that plane,
I was sure it was over.
I left the airport afraid
I'd never see you again.
And then you showed up
the very next day.
That was a good surprise.
You know, I think about
the decision you made.
Maybe I was being naive,
but I believed...
that we would grow old together
in this house,
that we'd spend holidays
here and...
have our grandchildren
come visit us here.
I had this image of us
all gray and wrinkly,
and me...
working in the garden,
and you repainting the deck.
But things change.
If you need this, Jack,
if you really need this,
I will take these kids
from a life they love,
and I'll take myself from the only
home we've ever shared together...
and I'll move wherever
you need to go.
I'll do that
because I love you.
I love you,
and that's more important to me
than our address.
I choose us.
Oh. I'm gonna chase you.
You can't catch me.
No, you can't. You can't.
Oh!
Whoa! Oh. Whoops!
I fell down.
I knew you'd come back.
Oh, Annie.
I love you.
- What are you doing?
- Ringing my bell.
Ninety-nine cents, darling.
Out of ten.
- You!
- Jack!
What's up?
How you feeling, baby?
Why are you here?
Here's your change, darling.
Five, six, seven, eight,
nine, oh-one.
Is that rock salt?
Look at you, man. Went and got
all domestic and everything.
You really figured
some things out, huh?
You're not
sending me back.
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.
Hey, did you hear me?
- Wait a second.
- I'm talking to you.
You see that?
Character. And for what, for nine
bucks? That's just so disappointing.
I'm not going back.
You understand me?
- Okay, relax, Jack.
- You can't do this.
You can't keep coming in and out of
people's lives, messing things up.
It's not right.
A glimpse, by definition,
is an impermanent thing, Jack.
I've got kids.
I'm going home.
Is it morning yet?
No, honey.
Go back to sleep.
Take care, Annie.
I'm going back to the mother ship.
Hey.
Hey.
These past few weeks,
I know I've done some...
some unusual things.
It's been interesting,
that's for sure.
I've done some good things,
too, though, haven't I?
You've been Jack Campbell,
and that's always a good thing.
I need you to remember me, Kate.
How I am right now...
at this very moment.
I need you to put that image
in your heart and keep it there.
Keep it with you
no matter what happens.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.
Please just promise me.
You have to promise me, because if you
don't, then it's like it never happened,
and I don't think
I can live with that.
I promise.
Promise me again.
- I promise.
- Okay.
Now come to bed.
Soon.
Yeah.
What time is it?
Okay. Yeah.
- Waiting for me by the door, huh?
- Paula.
Wow.
Merry Christmas.
Christmas?
It's not Christmas.
It's whatever you
want it to be, Jack.
It's not Christmas.
Jack. Jack?
Can I help you?
Is Kate here?
- Does Kate live here?
- Kate? No.
There's nobody named Kate here.
Of course not.
You okay?
No.
Hello.
Santa Claus, where are you?
Everybody's here.
- Adelle?
- You're a half an hour late.
The emergency strategy session?
Trip to Aspen?
Is this ringing any bells?
Everybody is panicked
here, Jack.
Jack?
I'll be there in 20 minutes.
No, I'm not gonna go talk to them until
I have something to talk to them about.
Steve, I don't care if it's
Christmas day. We're in a crisis here.
Wait a minute. Jack just walked
in. I'll call you back. Jack.
Thank God that you're...
- You're here. Are you all right?
- What's going on here?
What's...
Well, it's not good.
Bob Thomas has been talking to a European drug
company, Jack, and we don't know which one.
They're gonna let Bob buy a minority stake,
and let him keep running the entire company.
Global knows. I don't know how they know,
but they know and they're up in arms.
They think that somehow we should
have been prepared for this. Prepared!
Oh, God, we're in trouble.
You know something, Alan?
Somewhere inside of you, there's
a much more assertive person.
Is this another one of those
Sun Tzu Art of War tricks?
No.
So what are we gonna do, Jack?
Jack?
I'll tell you exactly
what we're going to do.
You're going to do whatever
you have to do to find out...
which European company
he's been talking to.
Then I'm going to
clean myself up,
fly to Aspen and drink
eggnog with Bob Thomas.
His wife and kids will be playing
in the background in the snow...
while I convince him
that the European company...
is the devil...
and Global is the answer
to his prayers.
Then I'm gonna spend
four hours skiing... alone.
Completely and utterly alone.
I'm going to do that
because that is my life,
that's what's real...
and there's nothing
I can do to change that.
For Manhattan.
Kate Reynolds.
I need an address too.
It's very fragile, so I want you
to be very careful with it, okay?
It's valuable.
It's over 300 years old.
You'll probably need a few
guys to carry it. All right.
The painting is also very,
very old, so take extra care.
It means a lot to Kate, okay?
I appreciate it.
Yeah? What?
Are you from the moving
company? I'm Jack Campbell.
I'm an old... friend of Kate's.
Kate, some guy is here.
Did you call the airline like I asked
you to do? It's like two hours...
- Jack.
- Kate.
God, it's been a long time.
You look...
- You look great.
- Thanks.
I... Come on in.
Come on in.
I'm just doing some... Lori,
do you know where those boxes...
I'm sorry.
No, no, no! You know what... Jack.
Don't... Please.
I don't even care.
Oh, great. Thank you.
- What's going on?
- I'm moving to Paris.
Hey, Lori, have you seen that
box? It says "Jack" on it.
I put it with the rest
of the Salvation Army stuff.
Do you want me to look for the
box or call the airline, Kate?
Hey, kind of under
a little pressure here.
Hey, kind of giving up Christmas
day for my ex-boss here.
Hey, didn't mind offering to help when
she was opening the Prada bag I gave her.
- Maybe it's by the wardrobe boxes.
- Thank you.
- So you're moving.
- Yeah, to Paris.
My firm has an office there.
I'm gonna be heading it up.
Paris. Paris, France?
That's the one.
So you're... you're not
at a nonprofit firm?
God, no, not with
what they pay me.
Are you married?
No, I never got married,
Jack. You?
Not exactly.
Look, could we take a minute here,
maybe go get a cup of coffee
or something?
- I'll go for a cup of coffee.
- Yes. I found it.
Congratulations. Your
earlier flight was canceled,
but I got you out of
Kennedy on United at 7:00.
- Excellent.
- Am I good or what?
Yes, you're brilliant.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Here you go. It's just
some old stuff of yours.
Do you ever think
about us, Kate?
About what might have happened?
Jack, I'll tell you what.
If you're ever in Paris, look me up and
we'll go have that cup of coffee, okay?
Or cafe. Or cafe au lait.
Oh, wait. No, no, no, no!
Don't close that up. I will
never find this box again.
Well, I marked it. Just
be more specific next time.
We'll leave it open then. I was
just trying to close it up.
Make a right here.
Sir, you're gonna be late
for your flight.
We're not going to the airport.
You can't leave this here.
You can't park here!
Kate! You can't go.
- Don't get on that plane.
- Jack?
Please, let's just go have a cup of
coffee. That's all I'm asking for.
I'm sure there's another
flight to Paris tonight.
Jack.
What are you doing here?
Do you need closure?
Because if you do, after
all these years, you got it.
I'm okay. I'm fine.
I... I was heartbroken, Jack,
but I got over it,
I moved on, and...
you should move on too.
Okay? I'm sorry.
I just can't...
I've gotta go.
I-I... I'm sorry, Jack.
I'm sorry. Excuse me.
Can I just...
I'm sorry. I was here.
We have a house in Jersey!
We have two kids.
Annie and Josh.
Annie's not much of a violin
player, but she tries real hard.
She's a little precocious, but that's
only because she says what's on her mind.
And when she smiles...
And Josh,
he has your eyes.
He doesn't say much,
but we know he's smart.
He's always got his eyes open.
You know,
he's always watching us.
Sometimes you can look at him
and you just know...
he's learning something new.
It's like witnessing a miracle.
The house is a mess,
but it's ours.
After 120 more payments,
it's going to be ours.
And you,
you're a nonprofit lawyer.
That's right.
You're completely nonprofit.
But that doesn't seem
to bother you.
And we're in love.
After 13 years of marriage,
we're still unbelievably in love.
You won't even let me touch you
till I've said it.
I sing to you.
Not all the time, but
definitely on special occasions.
And we've... we've dealt with our share
of surprises and made a lot of sacrifices,
but we stayed together.
You see,
you're a better person
than I am,
and it made me a better
person to be around you.
I don't know. Maybe it
was all just a dream.
Maybe I went to bed one
lonely night in December,
and I imagined it all, but...
I swear, nothing's ever
felt more real.
And if you get
on that plane right now,
it'll disappear forever.
I know we could both go on with
our lives, and we'd both be fine.
But I've seen...
what we could be like together.
And I choose us.
Please, Kate.
One cup of coffee.
You can always
go to Paris.
Just... please,
not tonight.
Okay, Jack.
Okay.
