RADIO ANNOUNCER:
Okay, what we're
getting now is, yes,
they're saying
it was, in fact,
a fire that erupted
inside the external tank
of the ship
exactly 98 seconds
after it entered
the asteroid field.
No one is sure
what caused the fire
which led to
the massive explosion
killing all 12
crew members and scientists
aboard the space
shuttle Deliverance,
taking with them our
last and only hope.
Once again,
if you're just tuning in,
the CSA space shuttle
Deliverance
has been destroyed.
The final mission to
save mankind has failed.
The 70-mile-wide asteroid
known commonly as "Matilda"
is set to collide with Earth
in exactly three weeks' time,
and we'll be bringing you
up-to-the-minute coverage
of our countdown
to the end of days,
along with all your
classic rock favorites.
This is Q107. 2.
I think we missed
the exit.
...they say the damage
to the tower has rendered
all cellular
telephones useless.
No word yet on how long
before water and power
will be shut off altogether.
But we'll be bringing you
all the information you need
just as long as
we have a live feed.
And be sure to stay tuned
at 9: 00 p.m.
Eastern Standard Time
for the End of the World
Awareness Concert.
RADlO ANNOUNCER:
The human migration
continues...
SURFER: Sorry, dude!
It's okay.
WOMAN: What are you doing?
MAN: Hey, up yours, pal!
DODGE: I'm sorry, sir,
that's not covered
under your current policy.
I'm afraid the Armageddon
package is extra, yes.
Well, that protects you
and your family
against any sort of
apocalyptic disaster.
Asteroids, obviously,
plague, famine, locusts...
Drawbacks? Um...
The premiums are high...
I'm sorry...
Can you just hold on
for one moment? Thank you.
So feel free to wear
your casual Friday
clothing pretty much
any day of the week.
And since Ted in
Human Resources
is no longer with us,
I thought I'd let you all know
of a few positions
in upper management
that have been
made available.
So, if anyone wants to be
Chief Financial Officer...
CFO? Anyone?
Life has no meaning.
ALFRED: Anyone?
I really think
I'm coming down
with something.
BlCYCLlST: On your right!
On your right, buddy.
On your right!
You could have
told me that yesterday!
Linda?
Oh, hi, Elsa.
Hi, Mr. Dodge.
Okay, I finish.
Okay.
Me estoy volviendo vieja,
Mr. Dodge.
I getting older.
I didn't mean to rush
you off or anything.
Do you have
someplace to be?
I mean, ifyou want,
you could...
I don't know,
you could watch TV here,
or something,
whatever you like.
Oh, my kids are waiting.
Oh, right. Of course.
You have kids.
Listen, Elsa,
you don't have
to come next week.
Or, you know, ever,
if you don't want to.
It's okay.
You firing me?
No, no, no. No, I just...
Is this because
I don't watch
TV with you?
No. No. I, uh...
I just thought,
considering...
There's just no need to...
Nothing.
Forget it. It's fine.
You're out ofWindose.
More Windose, got it.
See you next week, Mr. Dodge.
Okay.
I regret my entire life.
Okay.
Okay.
Bye!
Bye, now.
NEWSREADER:
Well, it's no longer
just the postal service.
Commercial airlines have
discontinued altogether today.
After much delay,
the final flight,
piloted by Delta Airlines,
Ieft Chicago Midway
at 3:45 Central Time,
touching down in
Seattle at 6:15 Pacific.
Private charters
have been given
military clearance
to use intercontinental
airspace at their own risk.
And now
the traffic report. Amy?
We're fucked, Bob.
NEWSREADER:
Thank you, Amy.
Oh, shit.
RADlO ANNOUNCER:
...they have yet to make
a statement regarding rumors
of a classified space launch
for high-ranking
government officials,
religious figureheads,
and important contributors
to athletics
and entertainment.
They have predicted
the exact location of impact,
but the government
is refusing to release
this information to the public
to avoid creating
an even greater
sense of panic.
Oh! You're early!
Hi.
Aw. Warren told me
about Linda.
Oh, yeah...
I am so surprised
she didn't do it sooner.
She never really
looked happy,
especially when
she was with you.
That's new information.
Really?
Mmm-hmm.
Why do you think
she didn't want
to have kids?
Karen Amalfi is
coming alone tonight.
Don't. Do not.
Do not what?
Please, Warren.
Can we just have a few
sober moments tonight?
This is the
Last Supper, Diane.
You think Jesus was sober
for his last supper?
You think he turned
water into lemonade?
Dodge,
a little help, please.
Uh-uh. No, no, no, no, no.
Dodge is my friend.
My friend.
Look at this, my friend.
This is a Don Ramon cigar.
This is the hardest
cigar in the world...
Can you chop those
a little louder, please?
This is the hardest cigar
in the world to find.
And tonight,
I'm going to share
one of my last 13 with you.
How's that sit?
Hi, Danny.
Hey, can I fix you
a drink, son?
Quit ruining my life.
DlANE: Good for you,
sweetie.
Express yourself.
Go fuck yourself!
I was thinking
maybe we should set up
Dodge with Karen.
Don't you think?
Oh, my God,
will you stop it?
What?
He doesn't want to
get set up with
one ofyour gross friends.
He needs to
meet somebody!
No, he doesn't!
Leave him alone.
He is alone,
look at him.
I'm fine.
No, honey,
you're not fine.
You're gonna die alone.
Doesn't that bother you?
He's not gonna die alone.
Yes, he is.
He's not gonna die alone.
He's gonna die
with everybody else!
There's just no need
to cling to who's closest.
This isn't
the fucking Ark, Diane.
This is the Titanic!
And there is not
a life raft in sight.
Welcome aboard.
Dodge, you remember
Karen Amalfi.
Hello, good to see you.
Hi.
It's everything
I never wore.
Ta-da!
Mmm!
It's very nice,
very shiny.
You're funny.
Hmm.
So...
Well...
We decided that
we would use this time
to be with family.
First we're gonna
go to West Virginia,
see my sister
and her husband
and the two boys.
Even though
we just saw them.
We just saw them.
And then Lacey
wants to go to her
stepfather's in Aspen
so that she can
tell him to fuck off.
And also ski!
And ski.
Great!
CHlP: Yeah.
Karen?
Oh.
Um... Hmm.
Okay, well, I think
I'm finally gonna
take that pottery class.
And... Well,
I'm gonna eat
whatever I want,
and totally
not even care. Just...
Go, girl.
And maybe I'll, um,
be spending a little time
with someone special.
Yeah.
Oh, me? Let's see...
What was the question?
WOMAN: Qué serà, serà!
We're gonna ski first,
and then she's gonna tell...
WARREN: Drink! Drink!
Drink! Drink! Drink!
Fight through the burn,
fight through the burn!
Fight through the burn!
Yes!
Yes!
Winner's wine!
Hey, Dodge!
Hey, Roache.
Dodger!
I'm gonna miss you, man.
Gonna miss you...
Oh, boy.
It's the fucking
Wild West, you know?
Is it?
Come on.
Single guys like us,
I mean, we gotta grab
this thing, you know?
Because it is
a different world now.
It's a different world.
Okay.
We gotta... You know?
No, I don't. I don't...
I don't...
You don't? Dude,
the sky is falling.
The sky is falling.
And it's raining pussy!
It's raining pussy
Dude, ever since
Deliverance, man,
I've been with
a different girl
every day.
And they don't care
about getting pregnant.
They don't care
about diseases,
or are you gonna
call them back,
or can you
provide for them,
or do you have
a small dick,
or are you related.
All right?
And it's like
the apocalypse...
The apocalypse has
leveled the field, man.
Oh, my God.
Do you want to
double-stuff that cookie?
Do you
want to double-stuff
that cookie with me?
Two chefs in the kitchen
We're double-stuffing
the cookie
Dodge and Roache
You guys, look!
Sarah and Dave
brought heroin.
It's time.
Bucket list! Bucket list!
Wait, where's Lacey?
Let Lacey do it,
she's a dental assistant.
I'll do it.
Yeah, you do it, Lace.
ROACHE: Here we go.
DlANE: Oh,
don't grab, Roache.
Let's watch her,
let's everyone
watch her do it.
ROACHE: Put some
Radiohead on.
I want to do heroin
to Radiohead.
WARREN: Yeah! Yeah!
This is dynamite!
Everybody, run!
I'm kidding! It's not.
It can't hurt you
unless you get
about this close to it.
Are you hiding?
Yes.
You don't have to do heroin
ifyou don't want to, sweetie.
Look, I tried.
I just can't spend
the last month of my life
getting to know someone.
It's ridiculous.
You don't like Karen?
I couldn't
possibly give a shit.
I'm not gonna sit across
from someone and hear
all their stories,
even if she was
someone I could be
interested in,
because I just...
I'm not sure that
the month between
my wife leaving me
and the end of the world
sounds like good timing.
Do you?
What... Hey...
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
What?
What?
What?
You're Warren's.
No, I'm not.
Nobody's anybody's
anything anymore.
Why did Linda
get to disappear?
Why does everybody else
get to do what they want?
I don't know
what I want.
You can't run
from this, Dodge.
Hello?
You okay?
No.
How could I be so stupid?
I don't know.
I don't know you very well.
I'm never gonna
see my family again.
I missed the planes,
all of them.
I mean, God,
it's the end of the world
and I'm still 15 minutes late.
I can hear
my father say it now.
I can hear him say,
"Flaky and irresponsible,"
and he's right.
How could I do this?
I put my energy
in the wrong places,
I give my time to
the wrong people.
I mean,
when I think of all the...
All the holidays
I didn't spend
with my mum and dad
to be with some guy
I used to know.
Would you like to come in?
I won't steal anything
ifyou don't rape me.
Agreed.
My name's Penny.
I'm Dodge.
How long have you
lived here?
Three years. You?
I just broke up
with someone.
Oh, I'm sorry.
No, I mean...
You know,
it was building to this.
He's just taking the night
to clear out his stuff.
I mean, it's always better
to sleep on the fire escape
than have pity sex,
I always say.
Mmm.
What's that?
What? Oh, that is cough
syrup with codeine.
Splash of vodka.
Can I have a sip?
Actually,
I'm feeling
a little...
Mmm.
You want some weed?
Hmm?
Oh, no, thank you.
It's the only thing
that sends me to sleep
and the only thing
that wakes me up again.
I mean, seriously,
I've got a wicked
case of hypersomnia.
I mean, I could sleep
through the apocalypse.
Who's the girl?
Who?
Oh. That's Olivia.
Is she the one
that got away?
Well, they all got away,
but she was the first, yeah.
Are you gonna go
and get her back?
I'm sure she has
enough on her plate.
And what is it about
the end of the world
that brings them
all out ofthe woodwork?
COMMENTATOR 1:
...there he's got it.
COMMENTATOR 2:
Yeah.
He changed his mind, as he...
...doing a terrific
job of cutting him off.
Now coming from behind,
he's got him
around the shoulders,
and down goes...
Oh.
I'm ready to go
downstairs now.
Oh?
Wait here a tick.
Okay.
He's gone.
Took my Pet Sounds with him.
I should've seen that coming.
Mmm.
So...
So...
What are you doing
with the rest of your life?
Oh, um...
Little of this,
little of that.
Probably catching
up on some "me" time.
Find God.
Maybe move around
some chairs.
Well, maybe
I'll run into you
at a support group
or an orgy or something.
Yeah, that sounds nice.
Uh...
What's that?
That's your mail.
Why do you have it?
Oh, you know
how the mailman would
sometimes put the mail
in the wrong box?
Uh-huh.
Well, over time,
say like... Well,
three years, I mean, it...
God, it really
adds up, doesn't it?
Isn't it funny?
I mean, how we've lived
so close and
we've never said hi.
Oh, but I did meet
your roommate a few times.
My roommate?
You mean Linda?
Linda. Linda, right.
And her boyfriend,
what was his name?
Oh, God, they seemed
so happy together.
What was his name?
I haven't seen
them in a while.
Are they all right?
What was his name again?
I forget.
$8.50.
Come on.
BOY: Give it to me!
I'll hit it!
MAN: Fuck, yeah! Hit it!
Whatstarted as a few
individuals acting out
has quickly escalated
into a massive riot
sweeping through
the streets of downtown.
If we could show
the live footage, Dory?
Dory?
You see people using
every available weapon,
Iooting, smashing windows,
setting fires,
and in some cases,
attacking one another.
With the lack of
police presence,
we are seeing people
with nothing left to lose.
They appear to be
moving off Main Street
and heading towards
Division Avenue,
where residences
and businesses
are more at risk.
And perhaps
it's only a matter of time
before the city is
too dangerous to inhabit.
Oh, my God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Okay. Okay.
Oh, Sorry. Okay.
Good, Sorry. Here we go.
Come on.
Penny?
Penny! Penny?
Penny!
Who the fuck are you?
Oh, shit! I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm Dodge,
I live upstairs.
I've never
seen you before.
We've run into
each other a few times,
but that's not...
I'm pretty good with faces.
Anyway... Obviously,
there's a riot going on.
Maybe you heard
the screaming,
smelled the burning.
If you could
just wake up Penny,
I think we should get out
of the building as
soon as possible.
Jesus.
You're fucking her,
aren't you?
What? No... What?
No, I'm...
No. I'm not.
Oh, I knew it!
I knew it.
Fuck! I knew it!
Ow! Ow! Ow!
Shit!
Okay, all right.
Penny! Come on,
here we go. Wake up.
DODGE: There you go.
Hey! I decide
when Penny wakes up!
This isn't what
it looks like.
I broke my hand, baby.
I hope you're happy.
It's my guitar hand.
Aren't they both
your guitar hands?
Penny, there's
a small riot brewing and
we need to go, right now!
She's not going
anywhere with you...
Would you
please just stop?
We all need to go!
Come on! Here we go!
Here we go, guys! Come on!
My hand! My gift.
Will you just
look at it? I broke it.
OWEN: This is the guy?
I can't believe
you want this creep
instead of me.
Hey! Hey!
I'm not kidding!
Let's do it!
Oh, he's old!
He's not even good-looking.
What, do you have a job?
Mister Job?
Owen!
I told you there
wasn't anybody else.
Oh, shit, my records.
So you broke up
with me for nobody?
Do you not see
how that's worse?
We don't have time for this.
Scott Walker, Wilco...
John Cale!
Hey, that's my Cale.
We don't have time
for any of this, guys!
Goodbye, friends!
DODGE: Come on.
Give me that Cale.
DODGE: Okay, here we go.
PENNY: I'll drive.
All right, all right.
OWEN: Hey!
Watch out for my hand.
Here we go.
I can't believe
you're breaking
up with me now.
It's the worst timing
for me, ever!
We didn't
get back together.
What do you call
last night?
Nothing happened!
Since when is
snuggling nothing?
Shit. I thought
it was right there.
You don't remember
where you parked?
No, it was...
It was on...
It was on 1st and 9th.
Fuck, maybe
it was 10th and 2nd?
This way.
It could have been 3rd...
It was definitely one
of those combinations.
OWEN: I'm the asshole, right?
Everything's my fault?
DODGE: Can we just
concentrate on
finding the car?
No, Owen,
it's not about that.
I'm just saying
that we're not a match.
I mean, isn't it better
we find out now,
rather than later?
No!
What do you mean,
not soul mates?
I love you.
I want to
take care of you.
Just get...
Penny, let's go,
come on!
Owen?
Come on!
You okay?
Come on! Go forthe car.
There it is!
OWEN: Is this because
you pay my rent?
Because I had to swallow
a lot of pride to
let you do that.
Get in the car, Owen.
I'm not leaving the city.
Well, it's my car.
Oh, that's right,
I don't have a car.
Throw that in my face
while you're at it.
They're right on top of us!
"They're right on top of us!"
Would you get out and help?
I'll do it!
No, no, no.
No, no, no. I'll do it.
Just...
Oh, God, there's a guy.
There's a guy right there!
Cut the wheel! Cut it!
What are you doing?
Cut the wheel!
I'm...
Cut the wheel!
Fire! Fire!
There's fire!
OWEN: You're not
cutting at all!
Are you freaking blind?
God, here they come!
What is wrong with you?
Hey! Hey!
I know a guy with a plane.
Ifyou drive me to
where I need to go,
I can get you to your family.
Hello? Cut the wheel!
That's it. Now come
forward a little bit.
Ah, he'll be fine!
Hey!
So tell me
about this plane.
You know, hybrid cars
don't need as much gas.
Yes. They still need
a little gas, don't they?
No, I'm just saying,
you don't have to
fill them up as much.
Does this mean
we're not going
to the plane?
Look, maybe
you should just
forget about the plane.
I left Owen in
the middle of a riot.
He used you as
a human shield, Penny.
You don't even know him.
Look, you're the one
who woke me up
in the middle of the night,
dragged me out of bed...
You're right.
I don't know why
I bothered saving your life,
after you ruined mine.
What is that
supposed to mean?
What? What is that?
Well, you know how
sometimes the mailman
would put the mail
in the wrong box?
Well, sometimes,
the girl that
you never got over
sends you a letter.
That's from the girl?
My God.
Oh, my God!
That's great, right?
Yeah, it's pretty good.
What would be great
is if I could call her
from a regular phone,
or I could just hop
on a train to wherever,
or not die in
the outer suburbs.
But instead,
I am on the scenic route
to the guillotine
with you, and you.
She could be
at the fucking
pyramids by now.
She could have
blown her head off,
and I wouldn't know,
because I didn't get this
three annoying months ago!
Oh.
Now I feel bad.
Fuck. Look,
guilt isn't a feeling
that I'm comfortable with.
Well, fortunately
you won't have
long to live with it.
What are you doing?
Penny, this really
doesn't involve you.
I said I was
gonna get you there,
I'm gonna get you there, so...
Where was the last place
you saw her?
Where was she
Look, you don't need to
spend the last few days
ofyour life
with a total stranger.
You're not a total stranger,
and these aren't my last days.
Oh, you're a survivalist.
No, I'm not a survivalist.
I'm an optimist.
Hello!
You having some trouble?
Do you know
where the nearest
gas station is?
Yeah, but diesel is
all they got left.
Where you headed?
Where we headed, Dodge?
Somerset.
Somerset. Wherever that is.
I think Huntsville
might be as far as I'm going.
Great! Thank you!
GLEN: So,
what's your pilgrimage?
Because everybody's
headed somewhere.
Well, I'm going to see
my family, and he's...
He's looking for someone.
Who is it
you're looking for?
His high school
sweetheart.
Is that right?
Well, there's no
greater search
than that of lost love,
I'll give you that.
You married?
No, darling,
I never did walk the plank.
There was a special lady.
My Rita passed
seven years back.
You know,
it's all about who
you lay down with
when the lights go out.
Takes longer
than it should
to figure that part.
Truth is, it's nice to have
some company for a change.
Even strangers.
Why don't you
tell us your life story?
Then we won't be
strangers anymore.
GLEN: Yeah?
Well, sure. Let's see.
I was born in...
Wait a minute.
I should probably tell
Daddy's life story first,
so there's some context.
Okay.
Uptime?
Groovy!
Yeah. Daddy was born
in Skokie, lllinois.
And his dad
was born in Okie.
Used to catch bass.
So they run
a bunch of tests
and they all
come back with
the same bad news.
Doctors give me
six months to live.
Then I go home,
turn on the TV,
and they say three weeks.
If you ask me, a man is
not supposed to know
when his time is up,
it's not natural.
That's when you
find yourself renting
a gun and buying a bullet.
But that ain't
no way into heaven.
Isn't that right, Dodge?
Hmm?
No, I guess not.
I'm gonna go
drain the snake.
You wanna join me?
No, thanks, I'm good.
Okay, what a fucking weirdo.
I think he's soulful.
Who drives around
with shovels?
I don't trust him.
Glen? What?
He told us his life story.
Yes, and thank you
for that, by the way.
Do you know,
ifyou actually listened,
you might learn something.
Sorry needs to go out.
I'll go. I will take him.
I'm gonna take him
for a sniff.
Don't go anywhere.
I knew it
as soon as I saw you.
That detached look
in your eyes.
That vague way about you.
You almost had me
fooled with that line
about your
high school girlfriend.
I'm sorry, I don't...
Don't be sorry, son.
Just kill me quickly.
What?
Well, I thought
we could do it
in that nice field,
but if you're gonna
shoot me in the back,
then let's get it over with.
Shoot you? I don't...
Are we still
speaking metaphorically?
Well, what's it
gonna be, then?
Knife? Piano wire?
Okay, you know what?
She's gonna be
back any second.
Don't tell me
they sent a girl
to do a man's job.
I specifically
requested a male!
Unless you're
some sort of team!
Is that how this works?
Okay, you know what?
I don't think I am
who you think I am.
Well, that's a relief.
Because I was afraid
I could fight you off!
You know, Dodge,
when a man...
PENNY: Dodge? Glen?
Oh, my God.
Glen's dead.
Are you okay?
Did you get the plates?
PENNY: "When a man..."
"When a man..."
What do you think
he was trying to say?
I don't know, Penny.
"When a man..."
Loves a woman?
"When a man..."
Is a trucker?
The man...
The man committed
suicide via homicide
two weeks before
the apocalypse.
I'm not really concerned
with any Road Warriorwisdom
I may have
missed out on. Okay?
All right.
I'll drive.
Do you have the keys?
Oh...
Okay.
Okay.
You'd think a lifetime
ofwaiting for
the worst to happen
would have
prepared me for this.
How could anyone
prepare for this?
I always knew.
I always knew
it'd be over too soon.
I never saw myself
as an old man.
Really?
I thought I was
gonna live forever.
Was totally gonna peak at 40.
Well, I hear 30
is the new 40.
Luckily, I'm getting
my mid-life crisis
in just under the wire.
She must be really special,
huh? Olivia?
To want to find her
after so much time.
She was, yeah.
So why did you break up?
We were young.
We were not
fully formed beings yet.
Life just took us
in different directions.
She dumped you?
Yes.
What about you?
What about me?
Who's the one that got away?
I am, thank God.
I don't mean
I'm anything
special, I just...
I'm glad that part of
my life's over with,
you know? Relationships.
I thought
you weren't cynical.
I'm not cynical. I'm...
I'm clinical.
I am a recovering
serial monogamist.
Sounds very serious.
Very serious.
I went to this
therapist who told me
that I had problems
being alone.
But then, I mean,
she wanted to see me
five times a week,
so you tell me
who had the real problem.
You know,
if the end of the world
has taught me anything,
it's that I'm finally
getting my...
Oh, my God.
Is that a Friendsy's?
I would kill for a pint.
Hi, welcome to Friendsy's,
where everyone's your friend!
Hi!
Hi!
Two for dinner? Yeah!
Look at this little guy.
Is this okay?
Oh, yeah!
Everyone's welcome, yeah.
Dude brought in a wolf
last week. It's crazy!
Come on in!
Okay.
Taquitos!
MAN: Yeah, three orders.
I can't believe
you guys are still open.
Yeah, we thought about
closing up shop,
but then we realized
this is really
our family, you know?
In fact, the tragedy
has brought us closer.
Some of us too close.
That's impossible.
And under new management,
it's a lot less corporate.
Right, Steven?
Right. I hope
a booth is okay.
Yeah, it's...
We burned
all the chairs
in a bonfire.
I'm gonna pass you
off to Katie, okay?
You're in warm hands
with her.
My skin feels great!
Thanks, Darcy.
Isn't he incredible?
Hi, I'm Katie.
Can you
slide over, please?
Yeah.
Can I touch your hair?
Yeah.
Oh, it's so soft.
Thank you.
Can I get you guys
something to
wet your whistle?
Everything's awesome!
How are your mudslides?
Fucking awesome!
Can we get two mudslides?
Yes.
Thank you.
Do you guys wanna
know the specials?
Because these guys
are getting
really creative.
No, just the mudslides.
Okay! Gotcha.
Guys, I'm rolling
pretty hard right now,
but ifyou two
keep it super positive,
I will bring you
those M-slides.
And maybe an order of
spin-dip for the table.
That is amazing!
And you know what,
it's his birthday today.
Why didn't you
tell me that?
Happy birthday!
Thank you.
Wow.
I really hope you're
having a good time.
Yeah, I am having fun.
I think that this place
is some sort of cult
and we probably
shouldn't eat anything.
Oh, you're crazy.
This is amazing.
Look, people are
sitting down together,
everybody's happy. Hey!
There's a conga line.
Just like...
This is a piece of
American history.
It's a human landmark.
It's a shout-out to
the man upstairs to say... Oh!
I smell weed.
Excuse me! I smell weed.
Yeah, it's right this way.
Conga your way
to a great time!
Is it good?
This bun is a donut.
It's exactly what
you think a burger
with a donut bun
would taste like.
Mmm!
What did you do?
When?
You know, before,
like, as a living.
I sold insurance.
That's...
Oh.
Oh!
Oh, you're serious.
Yes, I am.
Oh.
Oh!
Okay. How does...
How does somebody
get into that field?
You dare to dream, Penny.
I don't know, you...
I guess you start
with all ofyour
childhood fantasies
of being a fireman
or an athlete or whatever.
And then eventually
reality hits,
and you realize that,
really, all you want
is to have a desk
somewhere with
your name on it.
But why insurance?
I didn't like law,
and the economy
was headed
in one direction.
I'm the type of person,
I just...
I feel more comfortable
with a safety net.
Whoops.
Mmm-hmm.
Yeah.
So, go on.
How do you know
a man with a plane?
I don't know him.
I said I knew him.
I know, I know.
I'm not getting
my hopes up. I'm just...
I'm just really excited.
Obviously.
...with
the Friendsy's family
It's your very
last birthday
Happy birthday!
There'll never be another
So tell all your
sisters and brothers
It's your very
last birthday
Happy birthday! Ooh!
Oh!
Okay...
That's... All right.
Hi, buddy.
Hi, there.
Can I join in?
Look, I don't
wanna be rude, but...
Oh, God!
Yeah, we should go.
We should go.
Okay. Sorry.
Here's some money.
Oh!
All right.
Come on, let's go.
All right, see you soon!
Okay, have a good night.
Let's get these off.
They were...
Oh, God.
Dodge,
I want you to be my last.
That's a lot of pressure.
Listen, l...
Sorry, you go first.
I wasn't saying anything.
It's just...
I think I got a little
carried away before with
the mudslides and the orgy,
and, you know, obviously,
things are very
complicated right now.
What are you doing?
I just want you
to know that l...
I wasn't trying
to take advantage.
Obviously, you're very young.
What are you, like 30? 31?
Twenty-eight.
Oh, God. Oh!
God, you try to be
a good person...
Relax, Dodge. It was...
It was end-of-the-world sex.
It was creature comfort.
Well...
If anything,
it was my fault.
You didn't do anything.
I think I did some things.
It isn't gonna
happen again,
I promise.
You've got Olivia,
I've got my family.
You know,
we both have more
important places to be.
Just... A little sex.
It was bound to happen,
Iet's not make
a big deal out of it.
I dated someone
from Camden.
Listen, Penny, it...
I don't understand.
What is he doing?
I guess he's...
Is he trying
to pull us over?
Oh, come on.
He can't be serious.
How fast are you going?
Who gives a shit?
Why aren't you
slowing down?
I think we can take him.
Oh. Hey! Hey! Hey!
Slow down!
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Slow down! Pull the car over.
Come on.
Don't you think
that he must have
better things to do?
Penny, pull the car over.
Jesus, what's he
gonna do, shoot us?
There's a very
real possibility
he could shoot us, yes!
All right! All right!
Let's pull it over.
All right! God, but...
But I should warn you,
my dad's ex-military
and he says I have
a really serious
problem with authority.
Put that away, please.
Give that.
Mmm, mmm.
No, it's all
I've got left
and I'm trying
to ration it.
Come on.
What do I do with it?
Oh, just...
Just put it in your mouth.
That was still lit.
Hello, Officer,
what seems to be
the problem?
Well, for starters,
you're driving about
over the speed limit.
Really? Huh.
I thought I was making
better time than that.
And you know,
you got a tail light out.
No.
Yeah.
Also, your plates
expired about a month ago.
Go on.
Um, that's it.
That's everything.
Those three things.
Well, why don't you
write us out
any number of expensive,
time-sensitive tickets,
and we'll be on our way?
I need some identification.
Of course.
My name is Penny,
and this is Dodge.
Hi.
Okay.
License and registration.
Well, you see,
that's where
we've got a problem,
because I didn't get
a chance to retrieve
my identification
before fleeing my home
during a deadly riot.
However, we were
fortunate enough
to hitch a ride with
a very nice trucker,
who, turns out,
had hired a hit man
to assist him in a suicide,
thus bestowing us with this...
This beautiful mode
of transportation.
So, the answer is no,
no license or
registration here.
However,
given the current
situation with the...
Couldn't you find it
in your heart
to set aside the law
just this once
and let us on our way,
so that I can
give my friend here
a fighting chance
of being with
the one he loves
before we all reach
our untimely conclusion?
No.
All right.
Oh, excuse me,
do we get a phone call?
No, phones are dead.
Okay.
Have fun.
Oh! Hello?
What are you in for?
Disturbing the peace.
Brilliant.
Well, might as well
get comfortable.
This is as good
a place to die as any.
I ruined your life.
No, you didn't.
Oh, yes, I did.
I ruined my life,
and I took you down with me.
I was a terrible neighbor,
and I'm a...
I'm an awful daughter.
Hey. Hey.
Shh.
DODGE: Look at him.
Sound asleep in
his sandwich board.
You know why?
'Cause he always knew
the end was near.
And he's currently
not surprised.
You are looking at
a vindicated man.
How come you're not
with your family?
I don't really have any.
What do you mean?
My mother passed away,
and my father drove away
a long time ago.
My wife recently ran away,
as fast as any
human woman could.
It only took Armageddon
to give her the courage.
Which is ironic, because
being afraid of dying alone
is why I got married
in the first place.
Your roommate
was your wife.
My wife was my roommate.
Should have listened
to my mother.
Even after she got sick,
she always made
the most sense.
You would have liked her.
She would have
liked you, too.
You think so?
She died alone.
Guess it doesn't
matter now.
How long since
you've seen your dad?
Um...
Twenty-five years?
Twenty-five years? Wow.
Well, don't you have
anything to say to him?
Nothing good.
Well, what about Olivia?
We were together
on and off for ten years.
She wanted to get married.
I didn't pull the trigger.
Somebody else did.
And then I met Linda,
and the rest is
almost history.
What did she say,
Olivia, in her letter?
She said
she and her husband
had gotten divorced,
and that she had
a 6-year-old son
named Marcus,
and she asked
about my parents,
and she said she missed me.
You know, garden-variety
"end of the world"
mumbo jumbo.
I did ruin your life.
No, you didn't.
I had a really
long head start.
Oh, man,
I don't feel good.
Is that the weed
kicking in?
What does it feel like?
Feels like
I'm falling off a cliff
with a bomb
strapped to my chest.
Well, that could be anything.
Damn it, Wally!
There you go.
Look who's here.
Look who's here.
Hey, hey, hey.
Come here.
There you go.
Well, sorry, folks,
but Wally's been
taking the quota
pretty serious these days,
and I'm afraid that...
Well, your truck
was impounded.
Is there some place
I can drop you folks?
Uh, Delaware.
Yeah... No.
How far is it to Camden?
RADlO ANNOUNCER:
No matter where
the impact occurs,
it will create a firestorm
that will wipe out all life.
Thank you!
So how long
were you with this guy?
Total?
Nine months,
plus six more.
How do you know
he's going to be here?
He's always here.
There he is.
Penny.
Hey, Speck.
Oh, my goodness.
I knew
you'd come back.
No, I'm not back. I...
We were just
in the neighborhood.
I haven't seen
this girl in 12 months
and she's just
in the neighborhood.
Lance Corporal James Speck.
Speck, this is Dodge...
Lieutenant Colonel
Dodge Petersen.
Look, we're in
a bit of a pickle,
and I was hoping that
you could help us out.
Helping you out of a pickle
should be my middle name.
Na-hah!
Come on.
Bring your little amigo.
You have to leave
the dog up top.
Mom just vacuumed
the bomb shelter.
Come on,
I'll show you the digs.
Fellas.
Hey.
That's Entertainment.
Sports and Recreation.
And if nature calls...
Hey.
Wow.
As you can see,
we have enough rations
to live down here
comfortably for
a good six months.
These walls are
pure titanium.
Yeah, I was going to say 11.
Resurfacing
won't be that easy.
The world will need
a strong leader.
Is that a satellite phone?
It is. You want to
call your folks?
What?
Yeah, I was talking
to your dad the other day.
What time is it
across the pond, 1600?
I don't know.
Mum?
It's me.
Yeah, yeah, no, no, no.
I'm fine. We got out.
Uh, me and a friend.
Yeah, he is.
Hi, Dad.
I miss you like crazy.
Tell me everything.
How's the garden?
Is everyone there?
Is that Benny?
Yeah, yeah. Put him on.
Oh, you twat.
No. You're mental.
Oh, my God.
Oh, I hear the baby.
Is that my niece?
Yeah.
She sounds beautiful.
What did you name her?
You have a lot of guns
and a lot of potato chips.
Yeah, gotta be safe.
So how long
you known our Penny?
About a week.
Give or take.
So what's your pitch?
My pitch?
'Cause let me
tell you something
about that girl.
She may be a romantic
on the outside,
but on the inside
she's all survivor.
And she knows her
best chance of survival
is sitting right here,
and I'm talking about me.
Can we restart
civilization
without her?
Sure.
But she deserves to be
one of the top quality
females in contention.
There's no room
for you, dude.
That's okay.
Got a pretty good lead
on a school desk.
SPECK: There she is.
Uh, we should go.
I thought
you were staying.
I promised I'd take him
somewhere. Can we...
Can we borrow one
from the fleet?
Are you sure you don't
want a fallout tablet
for the road?
That's okay, thanks.
The car's
a loan, Penny.
I want to see it
back here
with you in it.
Thank you.
For everything.
I should have
married you.
When?
When you would've said yes.
Dodgy-Dodge.
Keep her out of trouble.
You okay?
They sounded good.
They sounded really good.
My dry cleaner.
Meatball subs
at Zuzu's. Mmm.
Mmm... Mmm-hmm.
Uh...
Ducks pond
in the summertime.
Mmm, riding the subway.
Oh, you lost me there.
Nobody misses the subway.
No, I did some of my best
people-watching on the subway.
Huh.
How about things that
we are not going to miss?
Like going to the dentist.
Oh! Dr. Hoberman.
Oh, my God. Oh.
Dr. Hoberman.
That's it.
Wow.
I cannot tell you
how many hours
I spent out here
obsessing
over that window.
Which window?
Right there.
That's a good window.
I don't think
anybody's home.
Oh, come on,
we have to try.
I'll be right here
ifyou need me.
Nobody's home.
Try the knob.
You know what,
she's definitely not here.
Well, we've driven
all this way
and it has definitely
not been in vain.
You know what?
I think there's
a hide-a-key.
Okay, here we...
Go.
DODGE: You are insane.
Come on.
Looks the same.
Smells the same.
So what are we looking for?
Something with
an address, I guess.
Oh, my God!
What? What?
We have exactly
the same wallpaper
in our kitchen!
Don't do that, please.
Isn't that wild?
Aw!
Oh! Wow.
Okay.
Oh. Oh, I love this house.
Wow. And I can make
something with this.
I'll go check
the bedrooms.
Yeah, we used to break
into people's houses
when we were kids,
me and my brothers.
I mean, we wouldn't
steal anything.
We'd just eat
their ice cream
and watch cable.
Then this one time, Benny,
who must've been
about, like, seven,
he took off
all his clothes
and he got onto
this old man's
exercise bike...
Um, Penny?
Oh, wow.
How long was I out?
Couple of hours.
Think you needed it.
Well, I've lost athird
of my life to sleep,
what's another
couple of hours?
Can you grab the wine?
Yeah.
DODGE: Okay,
so explain this to me.
Mmm-hmm.
You picked the tomatoes,
you made the sauce.
You went out and
harvested the wheat.
Yes, I harvested the wheat.
That was actually good.
I don't know.
It was the best I could do,
but just imagine
a big juicy ham
instead of the canned beets.
Mmm. Perfect.
Aw.
How could anyone
abandon this face?
Look at that little face.
Look, look, he's got
bits of gray in his beard.
Highlights.
What'd you do? Before.
I think you could
say that I dabbled.
How did you learn
to cook like this?
Mmm.
I watched
everything my mum did
and did the exact opposite.
My dad had
the real talent,
and my mum was
sort of a cheerleader.
You've never seen
two people more in love.
I think that's the reason
I can never settle
for anything
less than amazing.
You know?
They made it look so easy.
There's a reason
that opposites are
supposed to attract.
I'm the result
of two romantics
getting together.
I'm totally screwed.
Mmm. I love this song.
I can't believe I nearly
never heard it again.
You know, this was
the first record
I ever got.
I stole it from
my dad's collection.
Pretended that he didn't know,
and then I'd hear him
whistling it the whole time.
Just to torture me.
Is that how you
got into records?
Yeah, he started it, but...
I don't know, I just...
I love records.
I mean, they're not
for everyone, you know?
You really have to
take care of vinyl.
It's very delicate,
it can get wrecked so easily.
You really have to love it.
Do you hear
how full it sounds?
Now, what you want to buy
is a thicker record.
They're more stable.
The grooves in
them are sort of
deeper and wider.
You get more detail.
I mean, they're
harder to carry around
'cause they're heavier,
but they're worth it.
You know,
my parents have this...
It's an amazing turntable.
It's vintage,
cherry wood Victor 45.
Oh! Perfect tone.
All the original parts.
I can't wait
to hear it again.
So, what else
are you going to do
when you go home?
I'm going to...
I'm going to listen
to my mum play piano.
I'm gonna sit
in my dad's garden.
He grows the most
ridiculous sunflowers.
They're like 10 feet tall.
I'm going to hang out
with my brothers.
I'm gonna play with
my niece and my nephews.
I'm gonna do all the things
I missed out on for so long.
That sounds great.
It is.
I'm not gonna waste my time
on the wrong person.
I'm not gonna
waste my parents' time
introducing them to
some future stranger.
And no more days spent
picking out what
you're gonna wear
for nights that
don't mean anything.
No more wondering
whether you're with
the right person,
or if this is the guy
that you're meant
to have kids with.
All those
ridiculous questions.
It's liberating.
That's what it is.
Maybe you just haven't
met the right guy.
You're a really nice person.
You are an awful
judge of character.
I'm gonna fix that.
Okay.
What do you think
Sorry would like to do?
I don't know.
Lay in the sun somewhere.
We could look
for a Frisbee.
Or I could set up
a squirrel hunt.
Do you think he's horny?
Oh, yes, I think he is
definitely girl-crazy.
Maybe he wants
to find his owner.
You know,
abandonment issues?
You know what?
Maybe we're
enough for him.
I don't know,
he seems comfortable.
What is it?
It has a return address.
Is it close?
Yeah, it's pretty close.
That's great.
So, uh...
We'll go
first thing tomorrow.
Okay.
Okay.
Uh, should l, um...
Should I disappear?
No, stay here in the car.
What happened?
What's happening?
Was she home?
Yeah, I think so.
Did you knock?
Why are we driving away?
I wrote her a letter.
I put it on her door.
She should get it soon.
You wrote her a letter?
Well, what did it say?
It just...
It doesn't matter.
I don't understand.
Why don't you want to see her?
What's happened?
We really can't
talk about this, Penny.
Why not?
Because I don't want it
to change anything.
Change what?
You have somewhere
you need to be.
And what about you?
What's changed?
Dodge!
You're not taking
this very seriously.
No, it's very good.
Wait. Keep practicing.
Hey!
Where are we?
Come on.
MAN: Who's there?
Frank?
Hi, Frank.
Dodge.
Is it a bad time?
Why, no. No, of course not.
Come in. Please, come in.
Thank you.
Dodger!
I can't believe it.
You're here,
you're really here.
Who's your friend?
This is Penny.
Penny, this is Frank.
Hi.
Hi. I'm his father.
Oh! Oh, it's lovely
to meet you.
You, too!
Welcome.
Well, you must be
hungry or something.
Actually, I was hoping
that I could talk
to you for a minute.
Sure. Uh, go right
in there. Go ahead.
Is there a restroom?
Yeah, right at the top
of the stairs. Here.
There you are.
Thank you.
Top of the steps
on your left.
There you go.
What's the dog's name?
Sorry.
What?
Sorry?
She your girlfriend?
I don't know.
She should be.
Did we get old or what?
So you're here to tell me
all the things I did wrong?
No, you know
all the things
you did wrong.
I came here to
ask you something.
I know
I could have handled
things differently.
I don't want
to talk about it.
You know,
your mother didn't
make it any easier...
Don't. Don't say
another word about her.
We were so young
when you were born...
And now you're not,
and neither am l.
And we had
our whole lives
to figure it out.
I'm just trying
to say I'm sorry.
Well, just say it, then.
I'm sorry.
Now what?
I don't know.
You were the one
with the question.
I guess I just
couldn't believe
you didn't wanna see
your old man again.
Your mother wouldn't
take my calls,
she ripped up
all my cards
and letters to you,
but, you know,
I figured when
you got older...
Not that it was
on you, no, no.
No, I did that.
I know I lost all my
privileges when I left.
You know,
when you were a baby,
she used to hold you
so tight sometimes,
I thought you
couldn't breathe.
Um...
Maybe that was just me.
I really am sorry.
It doesn't matter anymore.
We're in the same place now.
Well, I know
I wasn't there
for you back then.
It's not too late.
May I propose a toast?
Please.
To the beginning
ofthe world.
To the beginning
ofthe world.
It's a good one, that.
Such a good
cheap wine.
You are the love of my life.
Elsa, what are you
doing here?
It is Thursday.
Are you
shitting me, Elsa? Seriously?
Go home.
Just be with your family,
or do anything else.
I'm serious.
You... Leave. Please.
It's just that...
You don't... It's not...
I'm sorry.
I just... I'm not trying...
Never mind.
See you next week,
Mr. Dodge?
Okay.
Ah!
Bye, Elsa.
More Windose!
More Windose.
...once again,
CSA's latest report reveals
Matilda will be
arriving one week
ahead of schedule.
The point of contact
is 16 hours, 26 minutes away,
so be sure to
mark your calendars.
Also, a friendly reminder
to set your clocks ahead
for daylight savings time.
Spring forward.
That's one hour ahead.
On a personal note,
this is my final broadcast.
Our final broadcast.
On behalf of myself,
producer Bruce Hammond,
and everyone here
at the network,
we bid you all
a fond farewell.
It has been my pleasure
to bring you the news
for the past 27 years.
Tonight, I'll be sitting
across the dinner table
from my wife, Helen,
and we'll be talking
about our sons,
Henry and Paul.
And we'll be
saying our prayers
for each and every one of you.
Good night, good luck,
and God bless.
Hey, what is it?
How could you let me go?
I don't know.
It was so stupid.
I woke up.
I made him turn around.
I don't want to
fall asleep, okay?
Don't let me fall asleep.
Promise.
I promise.
What about
your parents?
They're romantics,
they understand.
Besides,
they've got each other.
I just want to be with you.
And I want to be with you.
I couldn't live without you.
No matter how long.
What do we do now?
I just want to
lay here with you.
Just want to talk to you.
What are we
gonna talk about?
Where'd you grow up?
Well, I was born in Surrey.
I know.
My whole family
are from there.
Mmm.
My mum was a journalist
before she married my dad.
They never fought.
Or at least we never
heard them fight.
Charlie's the oldest,
then Benny, then me.
We had a sister,
but she died
when she was born.
I still think about her.
Oh, God!
What was her name?
What was your
sister's name?
Um... Patricia.
Patricia Hope Lockhart.
That's beautiful.
That's a beautiful name.
I wish I'd met you
a long time ago.
When we were kids.
It couldn't have happened
any other way.
It had to happen now.
But it isn't enough time.
It never would have been.
I'm scared.
I...
Am madly in love
with you, Penny.
You're my favorite,
favorite thing.
I thought that somehow
we'd save each other.
We did.
Penny...
I'm really glad
I got to know you.
