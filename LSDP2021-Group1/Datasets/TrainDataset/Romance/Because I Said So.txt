Look at you.
Look over here.
Okay, great, great.
WOMAN: All right,
let's do this.
Do you like my new dress?
Okay, ready?
All right, say "cheese."
ALL: Cheese...
Oh, wait. Excuse me,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Maybe it's just me,
but can I just say,
why "cheese"?
I know it's not your fault,
obviously you didn't
make it up, but please,
it makes us look like
pod people.
How about something
more snapshot like?
WOMAN: That's good.
I think we've got it, though,
don't you?
I'm living the dream
over here.
Honey, did you see that
young man Cousin Dougy
brought with him?
He's been staring
at you all afternoon.
Don't destroy the cake.
I used fresh tangerines.
Can you taste it
in the frosting?
Has he really? It's delicious.
Yeah, God,
his eyes are gorgeous.
They're kind.
And they're gorgeous. Go on.
I'll go over.
You will?
Yeah.
Okay. All right.
Oh, but, honey.
Just don't do that thing
you do.
What thing, Mom?
Oh, you know
that little thing.
It's no big deal.
That, you know,
when you're insecure,
you're self-conscious,
that little very loud,
nervous laugh?
Honey, it's adorable, but...
Oh, God, look, there she goes.
Oh, look.
MAE: Oh, I know,
we see it.
She only buttons
the part she can see
in the mirror.
At least she shaves more than
the front of her legs now,
she's got almost the whole...
Hi.
Hi.
Okay, it's going...
It's okay.
Yeah.
Uh-oh. Kiss of death.
WOMAN: It was so...
DAPHNE: You're beautiful.
MAE: Are we going to
do the picture?
MAGGIE: All right,
let's do this.
Let's just do it, okay?
Okay.
This time I think
we should pose.
I think we should
pose for one.
Oh, wait a minute, wait.
Hold on for just one second,
okay? Where's Mil?
Oh, God, how did we
lose her?
Milly? Where are you?
I'm upstairs,
with Uncle Harold's nephew.
The politically-active
open-hearted journalist?
Maggie, what do you do?
You hit "Speaker," Mom.
No, no, I know.
Okay, I knew that, but...
No, but the one
that says "speak."
So how's it going?
It's good.
It's good.
Okay.
I think he may have
a hot dog with a bun.
Are you having a picnic? What?
No. Uncircumcised is back in.
You know that guy I dated
before Derek, he had a...
And I preferred it
because it was
so much more dramatic.
When it finally made its
appearance, you were like...
What's in there?
Just stop it for a second.
Just a little...
This is your wedding.
All right.
And don't forget,
you have one breast
smaller than the other.
Thank you, Mom. God.
Wait, didn't he get back
together with his wife?
Oh, no.
Well, Milly,
congratulations
on your first wedding.
Let's hope it's the first
of many. Cheers.
All right.
A little thyme, remember?
For hope.
And they say lavender
for remembrance.
But my grandmother
preferred marigolds
'cause she said
it made you remember
only the good stuff.
My God. All right,
we gotta cut off the champagne
and get some food
in their stomachs
before there's an encore.
Let's go ahead
and get the entrées ready,
all right?
Thank you.
Not a good time.
Honey, I was just thinking
about that brilliant
but went-overboard-
with-the-teeth-bleaching
flute player from Ohio.
Yup, he actually stopped
by work to surprise me.
Hey.
DAPHNE: How sweet.
He's getting to know
my staff as we speak.
I guess I was wrong.
I mean, I had him pegged
for one of those guys
who wants you
till he's got you
and then doesn't think twice
about sleeping
with your best friend.
You know, that kind of guy.
No, no, Mom. He's great.
Beautiful, beautiful.
You know, Mom, I gotta go.
We're about to serve
the entrées.
And I wore those shoes
that we just bought,
no wonder they were on sale,
my feet are killing me.
I'm gonna call you
when I get home, okay?
I love you, bye.
Milly.
Oh!
That's it, Cooper.
DAPHNE: Whose idea
was this?
A Korean spa?
MAE: Mine.
Oy.
Ma, why do you wear
the high-tops?
I just got these.
What's wrong with these?
They're just kind of
depressing.
They're kind of something
you would wear in a hospital.
Wait a sec, I'll have
you know, young ladies,
that this underwear
enhances the female form,
highlighting the elegance
of the waist and making
the legs appear longer,
instead of the...
Well, I'm sorry to say this,
but the awful, you know,
foreshortening aspect
of a thong,
which breaks up
the body disproportionately.
Mom, come on,
for your 60th birthday,
we're gonna break you down
and we're gonna buy you
something beautiful,
something that Grandma Moses
would not wear.
Yes, you are.
And speaking of your birthday,
we've talked about possibly,
like, a really small party.
We feel you should
have a party.
Not a big one.
Just intimate.
Elegant...
Something very sophisticated.
Because it's a really big
milestone for you, Mom.
No. Misses, no.
Absolutely no.
Misses...
No, I'm not going to
talk about it, we're not
going to think about it
and certainly I'm not gonna
not celebrate the fact that
my life is basically over.
Ma.
But I did find a recipe
for a butterscotch buttercream
cake that is to die for.
We got her.
Totally got her.
Massage naked.
Take all clothes off.
No. Not now, pal. No.
No.
Whose idea was this?
Which one of you could
possibly think that
I would ever enjoy this?
No, it was not. It was so you.
Just you wait.
No.
Hi, babe.
Okay.
Honey, I'm worried about you.
It's not sad sobbing.
I promise, Mom,
I'm fine, I'm fine.
It's just the pressure point
reflex thing.
Pardon?
What kind of oil
would you like?
Oh, wakana oh yulike
to you too.
Mom.
What? It's a greeting.
Hey, wait. What are you...
What are you...
What are you doing here now?
Hey, that's the head.
That's...
Soft to hard. Soft to hard.
God damn it.
Oh, my God.
Girls, she's not back
with Rafferty, is she?
She doesn't want to
talk about it, Mom.
I knew it. I thought we got
rid of that pathologically
ambivalent narcissist
three years ago when he almost
stood you up at Mae's wedding.
Well, you know what, Mom?
He's never gonna
stand me up again
because he's been sleeping
with my ex-boyfriend.
MAE: Oh, my God.
MAGGIE: Oh, God.
MAGGIE: I could kill him.
DAPHNE: Oh, God.
You deserve somebody
who wants you,
somebody who's as good
and as kind as you are.
Why do you always
have to put me down?
I'm not putting you...
Yes, you are.
Love is supposed to make you
feel good about yourself.
You shouldn't have to
settle for crumbs.
Okay, okay. I know.
I'm an idiot, okay?
I'm done. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
DAPHNE: No, no. No.
All right. You're the
psychologist in the family.
What do you think we should do
about your sister?
I swear, with men,
she's like psychotic flypaper.
They're either gay,
married, unavailable
or out of their minds.
No, Mom, you have to leave her
alone. You have to quit
making her so insecure.
She had the least
amount of time with Dad
who wasn't exactly
a great male role model.
And stop being a helicopter,
Mom, you're hovering.
You're right, you're right.
I'm gonna back off,
I'm gonna give her some space
to sort things out
for herself.
Good.
Yeah.
If only I could choose
for her.
No.
No. That is so...
That is so
Your parents
didn't choose for you.
Yeah, but maybe
they should have.
You know what I think?
I think you're fixating on her
to avoid dealing with this
very big birthday
you have coming up.
I am not fixating on her.
Is it crazy for me
to want her to have
one healthy relationship
in her life?
I mean, come on,
if she keeps up this pattern
of wrong choice
after wrong choice...
I mean, okay, one thing
when you're in your 20s,
but 20 years later,
it's not so pretty.
Maggie?
I don't...
I don't want her to end up
alone.
You know what I realize?
I give up the search.
I don't need anybody.
I mean, look at Mom.
She's been single
most of her adult life
and she's lived a great life.
So you know what?
I'm going to be
just like you, Mom.
Just like you.
DAPHNE: Milly, you are gonna
thank me for this later.
Okay.
"Adult Friend Finder."
"Over 14 million members."
Well, that's a very good sign.
I like how they use
the word "friend."
Friendship is the cornerstone
of any good relationship.
Oh, my God. Oh, sorry, Coop.
I'm sorry, honey.
Wait, okay. Wait. Shoot.
No, no, no. Be quiet, okay?
Gone, gone.
All goney, right? Gone.
Cooper, quiet.
Mr. Online Support?
Yeah, no. What's happened is
my computer
has apparently frozen.
No, I was just doing
a little bit of pre-Christmas
online shopping.
Why do you need to know
what site I'm on?
Oh, my God.
God darn.
Hello, is this We Match 4 You?
"Let me preface this ad by
saying if you are a nut job,
pervert or fruitcake, move on.
"Nudists, mama's boys,
the sexually confused
need not apply."
"Anarchists, xenophobes,
philistines, masochists,
sexists, bigots not welcome."
I know it's $5 a word.
No, well, don't worry.
I'm not that talky.
So let's just take it from
page two. "Chronically itchy."
"I'm looking for someone
with a steady job
who knows the value of work.
"That does not exclude
the independently wealthy."
Okay, hope that goes out...
Polka dots. Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, I like it.
I like it, I like it.
Oh.
Hi. You must be Daphne Wilder.
It's so nice to meet you.
Let's date your daughter.
MAN: I'll just dig in
real quick,
'cause I'm hypoglycemic,
'cause otherwise my
blood sugar hits the ground
and... You know? Okay.
I was just wondering
what you think the cornerstone
of any good relationship is?
What is in there?
So why don't you just
free associate, okay?
I say marriage, you say...
I say marriage.
No, no, I say marriage and...
I say marriage.
Right, but that's not what
I meant. I meant that...
I...
I...
Me.
Me.
I have a slight allergy
to dander and nut meats.
Okay, done,
thank you very much.
It's been wonderful
meeting you.
Thank you.
Appreciate it, yeah. Right.
Thank you very much.
Okay, yeah.
If I say marriage,
then what do you say?
Vera Wang.
Your name is?
Louie.
Huey.
I've already got a woody.
Uh!
How old did you say you were?
My name is Dr. Iris McDunna.
I'm sorry, I'm right
in the middle here, Iris.
I know.
I read your ad,
"You'll know me
by my polka dots."
I'm a licensed psychologist
and I wanted to offer you
my services.
I wanted to suggest
that as a mother,
you attend, free of charge,
one of my Letting Go seminars.
Hi. I think we were
supposed to meet now.
Yeah. Oh, that's...
Right.
Right. That is so...
Iris, I'm so sorry.
I can't afford to be rude.
I'll leave you my card.
Thank you so terribly much.
God. Thank you,
whoever you are.
I'll have another. Another.
I really don't think
I can't get through
another one of these
without being
heavily medicated.
That bad, huh?
Bad?
Yeah. Like...
Wow.
And I like that you're going
for a younger guy.
Me?
No, no, no.
That ship's docked.
No. No, this is
for my daughter.
Let me get this straight.
So you're meeting these guys
for her?
Uh-huh.
So she's cool with you
doing this for her, then.
Maybe you should just
go play your guitar.
She doesn't know, does she?
Look.
I wouldn't be here
if it weren't for the fact
that Milly is...
She's at a crossroads
in her life.
Another hard left
and I really...
She's like this person
who's too sensitive.
You know what I mean?
She's an innocent.
She's a pushover.
I'm usually not this
in-the-muck-of-it.
I mean, actually,
I consider myself
a reasonably sane mother.
Well, yeah,
it is a crazy love, though.
I mean, who's to say
I wouldn't do the same
for my own kid?
Mmm.
Excuse me. I'm Jason Grant.
I don't mean to interrupt.
I've been waiting
over by the bar,
but I only have so much time
before I have to
get back to work.
DAPHNE: I just wanted to
ask you about your family.
Yeah, well, my dad is an
engineer who was always
a closet architect.
And I grew up
with a love of old buildings.
I know what you mean.
So I suppose I became
the architect that he always
dreamed of being.
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.
Oh, thank you, dear Lord.
Can I order you something?
You know, actually it turns
out I'm so not hungry at all.
Let me get you the
It's the
best-kept secret in the city.
Can we have two orders
of that, please?
And a bottle of the
Castellare Chianti Poggiale.
If you insist, huh?
No, I do, I do.
Do you mind my asking why
a man like you hasn't found
a woman already?
Well, I'll admit
I'm a bit of a workaholic.
It's a very important time
in my career right now.
I've found women
but just not the right one.
A lot of great "almosts"
out there.
Oh, yeah, a lot of "almosts."
Yeah.
You speak Italian, huh?
No, I fake Italian.
I'd really love to learn it.
You know, Milly happens to be
a phenomenal cook.
She's always wanted to take
a cooking tour of Italy.
Oh, wow, I was gonna
go there this fall.
Really?
But it's a crazy time
for me right now.
My company is celebrating
their tenth anniversary.
Oh.
You're gonna need
a caterer then.
I mean, those kinds of
occasions should be marked,
don't you think?
You are good. So James Bond.
Yes.
Well, it was a pleasure
to meet you, Daphne Wilder.
Well, Jason, my pleasure.
Gotta love a woman
in polka dots.
Not everyone can pull it off.
Thank you.
Bye.
Bye-bye.
Bye.
Oh, my God.
Oh, yes.
And the winner is?
Duh. Hands down,
bachelor number 17.
Him?
Yes.
Oh, I don't trust that guy.
That guy was playing you
like a slide guitar.
He was not.
He's a very stable,
responsible, mature young man.
He has empty eyes.
They were not empty.
And who am I supposed to
choose anyway, huh?
Who do you think is better?
Me.
What?
I like you.
And I have an odd instinct
that I'd like her too.
Maybe I should meet her.
Let me be perfectly honest
with you, okay?
You're a very charming guy,
irresistible, in fact.
And that's why I know
you would be
a horrendous choice
because I'm not looking for
a great affair
for my daughter.
You know, like,
gorgeous musician
who's gonna break her heart.
I'm looking for
a life partner.
That's great. Thanks.
Yeah, no, I love being reduced
to a cultural cliché.
That's just terrific.
Because only musicians
break people's hearts. Wow.
Uh...
It's not the only place
I have them.
Well, look,
you're a great guy.
I hope you have a great life.
But I have to do
what's best for my daughter.
Yeah, of course you do,
but maybe you don't know
what's best for your daughter.
I beg your pardon?
Maybe you do.
Maybe I do.
Nice to meet you, Daphne.
Pleasure. Pleasure.
Here we are.
Almost here.
Yeah, we've landed.
We're in heaven.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Look. Oh, God.
Mil, look at this.
Mom, it's polka dots. It's so
Minnie Mouse. I don't even
know if I like it. Do I?
I'm hearing you hate it.
Me, too.
Oh, please, just try it on.
Why?
Because I said so.
Honey, look,
it might surprise you.
Anyway, you look beautiful
in dresses. In fact,
you know what I think?
I think that you should
wear it to that catered affair
on Sunday.
To work? Mom,
I spill things all the time.
Oh, come on, just try it on.
All right.
Okay. That's incredible.
It's not really me at all.
What are you talking about?
It is totally you.
Well, it's sort of
more you in a way.
You know what it is,
it's kind of Aunt Jemima
meets Betty Crocker.
You know, that's ridiculous.
Come on, sweetie,
you know what I'm going to do?
I made up my mind.
I'm going to get it for you.
No, no, no. You're not
getting me this dress.
I don't even like it
and it's absurd for work.
No.
Hello.
Excuse me.
These meatballs
are my mom's recipe.
Fantastic, I recommend
everybody try some.
I love that shade of orchid.
Uh-huh.
Thank you, Matisse.
The chicken satay has got
a really unique flavor.
What'd you use?
It's cumin. I'm so sorry,
I can't really chat right now.
You guys,
the chocolate waterfall's
not in the right spot.
Oh, no, we can't have that.
You know what?
Let's just go ahead
and just shift everything over
so it frames the temple doors.
Thank you.
Yeah. That's the perfect spot.
So, you like the building?
I actually think
it's a little cold.
I'm Jason Grant.
I'm the architect.
Milly. Nice to meet you.
Come on, Mom.
Pick up the phone.
Oh, Daphne. Here we go. Hello.
Oh, Mom, hi, it's me.
I have to tell you
the most amazing thing
happened.
This guy at work
asked me out.
He did?
Yes, he's so cute.
Mom, he's an architect.
We're gonna go out
Saturday night.
Oh, you are?
I'm just so excited.
I'm so excited.
Milly, well, that is
really great, sweetie.
That is so darn great.
It's great, right?
Mom, he's so cute,
I can't even believe
that it's happening to me.
And he loved the polka dots.
Thank you.
Oh, yeah?
Thank you Mom. Yes.
Well, honey, it's just,
I guess, dumb luck.
You're the best. I love you.
Okay.
Bye.
Bye.
Coop, come on!
Yep.
Hello, Jason, this is Bond.
James Bond. Call me.
I'm hearing rave reviews.
All right, I just pulled up.
I'm walking in.
It's okay. Don't worry.
I'm here, I'm here.
Sorry, sorry.
No, no, they're not angry.
They're not... Hold on. Sorry.
They're just... They're
probably hungry or something.
Feed them the spring rolls
from the Adams wedding
and the sauce
from the Levy wedding.
All right, I'm walking in.
Okay, bye.
There's a lot of static
out there.
You can say that again.
There's a lot of static
out there.
You know it's caused
by a lack of humidity
in the air
that causes an imbalance
of the positive and negative
charges.
You know, ice cream is known
to cut the static cling
in 98% of most cases.
I love ice cream,
but I'm really late to work.
And I'm so sorry.
Nice tattoo, though.
What flavor?
Why don't you get me
your favorite?
Why don't I get your favorite?
Okay.
I'll have the Fudgsicle.
Oh, no, no. The Dreamsicle.
Wait. Is that
the tall rainbow one
that's really
embarrassing to eat,
but it's really, really good?
Okay. Never mind.
I will have the Dreamsicly one
that has the green wrapper
with the Japanese writing
on it.
Thank you.
I'm really beginning to feel
like I'm never going to
meet anyone
and it's making me
feel hopeless.
Well, as I've said before,
Stuart, Sheila was a huge
loss, but that was 1993.
Oh, it's still so fresh.
This makes me feel like
when I was in the 2nd grade,
and I walked around
with a booger in my nose
all day and nobody told me.
Why didn't they tell me?
Well, more to the point,
why didn't Sheila tell you
she was unhappy?
Oh, God, this is making me
feel nauseous.
Maybe I should change
my appointment time
from Thursdays at 3:00
to Mondays at 1:00.
No, Stuart,
we've tried that before.
You had Fridays at 1:00
and Tuesdays at 11:00.
It really didn't help
your hypoglycemia.
Now let's focus
on where we ended last time.
Meeting new people,
joining an adult-education
class or a book club.
I did go to an
Internet dating service.
Good for you.
That's very brave.
It was a nightmare,
Dr. Wilder-Decker.
It made me
want to kill myself,
even more than the last time.
Wow. Well, what triggered
those feelings, Stuart?
This mother put an ad out
looking for a mate for her
daughter and I answered it.
A mate for her daughter?
Stuart, some people
really shouldn't have kids.
I guess I didn't pass the test
because she made me
feel about this big.
Well, I wouldn't worry
about that, Stuart.
Imagine how screwed up
any daughter of hers would be.
And then when I pressed her
as to why I couldn't
meet her precious daughter,
do you know what she said?
I really hear
it didn't go well.
"Because I said so.
That's why."
Mother, how could you?
When are you planning
on telling her?
Well, why does
she need to know?
I mean as long as she's happy,
that's all that's important.
And, my goodness, who knows?
This architect could be
the real magilla.
As I've always said,
"God couldn't be everywhere,
and that is why
he made mothers."
What? That was on
a Hallmark card we gave you,
and Milly thought
it was too corny.
Don't you dare tell her,
Maggie, or you and I are gonna
have some serious issues.
Well, we already have
some serious issues, Mom.
Always so dramatic.
Mother, this is like 6th grade
drama club. Speak English.
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.
Oh, hi, honey.
Oh, Mom.
I was just in the neighborhood
and I thought I'd drop by.
Okay, Mom. Please,
you have to start calling me.
I have a date that's
on his way over right now.
Oh, but Milly,
you look so beautiful.
Are you sure you want to
wear that dress, though?
It was such a hit
the first time.
I know,
but don't you think
you ought to mix it up
a little bit?
What for?
Well, okay, you know,
you're right.
You're right.
It looks perfect on you
and everything about it.
I'm just sort of wondering,
if maybe you ought to
button those buttons.
No, no, I like it like this.
Milly, you look like
you're asking for it.
I am asking for it.
Okay, all right, I'll pretend
I didn't hear that.
All right, what are you
going to do with your hair?
I already did it.
Oh, of course you did.
Sure you did.
And you're making cookies too?
That's about
the sweetest touch.
No, actually, I just want the
house to smell like cookies
when he gets over here.
Mom, it's 6:49, look.
And he's supposed to
be here at 7:00.
You have to go, please,
please, please.
Okay. I can take a hint.
It's not a hint. Mom, go.
All right.
Oh, he's here. He's here.
Okay, you gotta go.
All right.
You gotta go please, Mom, Mom.
All right.
But wait, sweetie.
Just have a good time.
Okay.
Feel free to be yourself,
but remember...
I love you, but you gotta go.
...don't be too, you know,
forthcoming with all your
failed relationships.
Okay, I got it.
And sweetie, sweetie.
I love you.
Keep that mystery alive.
I love you.
I love you for some reason.
Okay.
I'm going to pull my hair out.
What? What, what?
I know, I know.
Just one more little thing.
I don't know, Mom, I gotta go.
He's here.
I want you to wear this.
Oh, my God.
Grandma's diamond?
Yeah.
Put it on me, put it on me.
I want to wear it tonight.
All right.
Okay.
I know. I know, he's coming.
Don't worry. Here we go.
Okay.
Mom, you never let any of us
wear this. It's so special.
So special.
Thank you.
What?
May it bring you luck with the
architect. Your sisters and
I will expect a full report.
Okay?
Okay.
I'll give it to you tomorrow
night after I go out with him.
Tomorrow night?
Yeah, yeah.
I'm going out with
another great guy tonight.
He's taking me to Luna Station
to hear some music.
You are?
Can you believe that, Mom?
It's like I gave up,
I stopped trying
and the universe brought me
two amazing guys.
Great, right? Wow.
Whoa, that's so great.
It's one of those
amazing things, huh?
All right, sweetie.
Well now, bye.
Bye-bye.
Go, go.
Go, Mother, go.
Hi.
It was either this or roses.
Thank you.
Come on in.
Cookies?
Yeah.
Nice.
Really seem to have
such a different approach
and attitude towards life
that people don't really
get here as much, I think.
Okay, don't worry.
We're gonna get
a quick look at who he is
and then we're gonna go home
and finish watching
Gary Cooper in
Come on, man.
Okay. Yes. Yeah.
Okay. Go, go, baby.
Okay, okay.
Come on.
Coop, Coop, everything's okay,
sweetie. Where the heck am I?
God. Okay. Oh, jeez.
Okay. Let me just...
Okay, I'll turn this. Okay.
Luna Station.
Is, okay, what?
So where is Amherst?
Well, where is north?
The left?
Give me a left.
Give me a right. Left. Right.
Something like...
Please. For God's sake.
You know what you are?
I'll tell you what you are.
You are redundant.
And it's a horrible quality.
You awful machine.
And that's for you.
Are you guys ready to rock?
ALL: Yeah.
All right.
Let's play something
for Milly over there.
A little blues in E, okay?
One, two, three, four.
Now we're coming up on the A.
Molly, that sounds terrific.
I feel really bad.
No, no, I would have done
the same thing if one of
my staff had called in sick.
It's only gonna be
It's just that they memorized
an E progression
and that is a major feat
for them.
Okay.
Yeah, I'll be right back.
Go, Nicky.
Yeah.
A little bit harder
over there.
Strum a little bit closer,
up here.
That sounds really nice.
Really?
Well, thank you, teacher.
Actually, I love to sing.
My whole family loves to sing.
And when I was younger,
I always wanted to
take piano lessons,
but my mom was struggling
so much supporting us all
that I just felt
way too guilty to ask.
Here.
What?
What?
Play what you were
playing before.
It sounded really good.
Really?
Yeah.
I'm no good, but okay.
Try it.
Like that?
Yeah.
All righty.
I'll take it up here.
Okay.
We'll meet in the middle.
It's down there.
Sorry.
How about I come close to you?
I don't mind.
All right.
Why are there a lot of ducks
in Venice?
Ten ducks are swimming
down the canal
and one says,
"This place is quacked."
That's terrible.
No, that's really cute,
actually.
It's very cute.
This is me. Come on in.
I love this. It's so cozy.
Thanks.
So comfy.
Yeah.
Three, two, one, blast off.
I'm in orbit. I'm in orbit.
Okay, Lionel,
let's... All right.
Okay, come back here.
Let's start winding down
for bed, all right?
Who are you?
What planet do you hail from?
This is Milly from
planet Milly. This is Lionel
from planet Johnny.
Hi, Lionel,
it's very nice to meet you.
You have a 'gina.
I have a what?
I have a penis.
You have a 'gina.
Okay, buddy, give me
a break here, okay?
Can I see it?
Hey.
Lionel. Lionel.
Lionel.
JOHNNY: Dad?
Hi.
This is Milly.
Joe Dresden. Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
Sorry. It's moon dust.
It's okay.
Well, excuse me.
It's usually just us guys.
Johnny hasn't brought home
a gal in, God,
I don't know how long.
Great, I'm getting it
from both sides.
Sorry.
Come on, buddy, let's you
and me go in the other room.
These guys are boring.
Nope, nope, nope.
What'd you have
for lunch today?
Baloney sandwich.
I'm not the baloney.
Yes, you are.
I think we got him.
There we go.
We got him.
We'll see you.
Night.
Oh, my God.
Mr. Grant. This way.
Hey, man, how you doing?
This is so amazing.
Yeah.
It's really unbelievable.
Yeah?
This is so great.
It's beautiful.
It's great.
I love this angle on the city.
I never knew this existed.
Gosh.
So what's good here?
Well, I hope you don't mind,
but knowing your love of food,
I didn't want you to
miss these.
Oh.
No, no, no, that's great
'cause I make decisions
all day long.
You know, the Gillespies'
daughter is allergic
to chocolate,
but she wants a brown cake,
and...
My lease is up on my car,
do I get a hybrid? 'Cause
I really believe in them
but I don't know if it's time
to switch insurance, it's...
What I mean is, it's very nice
to not have to think
for a change.
Well, last time I was
in Italy, I was in Siena,
and they make this wine there,
and this is the only place
in the city that serves it.
You've been to Siena, right?
Oh, well, of course,
I haven't. No.
Are you kidding?
Wouldn't it be fun to drink
our way through Tuscany?
lt'd be amazing.
God, this calamari is so...
Is that City Hall?
God, I love old buildings.
You know, the attention to...
Not that I don't love
modern architecture
'cause I totally do.
It's so bold,
but you know what I mean.
Who wants to live
in all that concrete?
And yet, you know,
the Zen of clean minds,
that kind of Asian simplicity,
living without
all the clutter, is great.
This view is amazing.
My mom would love this view.
Oh, yeah?
Does she have good taste?
lmpeccable.
Now I know that this is
the part of the evening
where I'm supposed to sit
way over here in this chair.
But can I jump five spaces
and pass "Go"?
Well, "can" implies
"are you capable."
"May" asks the question.
Milly, may I?
Yes, you may.
Milly, may I kiss you?
I'm sorry.
Could you hold that thought
for a second?
I have to, like...
What?
Well, I just got that new
conference call feature,
so we thought we'd try it out.
New?
Hey, Milly.
Hi, how's it going?
Yes. He's a great kisser.
Wonderful.
Isn't that great, girls?
BOTH: Yeah.
That's so much better than...
Remember that Ted guy?
He seemed to have
a lot of potential,
Oh, yeah.
And as I remember,
an over-intake of Mentos
which didn't cover
the buffalo wing breath.
That's disgusting, Mae.
Though, as I recall,
those kisses bombed upstairs,
but had a certain finesse
downstairs.
I remember that.
Yes, downstairs and...
I don't want to hear it.
Guys, all right,
I gotta go kiss.
I gotta go kiss.
Okay, I gotta go too.
No.
Me three.
Bye.
No.
Okay.
What, honey?
Mom?
Are you okay?
What, honey?
No, yeah. I'm fine.
No, wait. Mom,
what's that sound?
Well, Cooper's in heat.
Good night.
Cooper's a boy. Mom?
He wants potato pancakes
in the shape of footballs
with Gandalf's face
on them in sour cream.
We can do that.
You start, though.
Hello.
Hi. Wow.
Lionel helped picked these.
He wanted you to know.
Oh, my gosh.
Thank you so much.
Lionel, they're beautiful.
And you know what?
You can actually
eat these flowers.
They're really good in salads.
Although, when I was your age,
I didn't like anything green.
And now I've learned to love
spinach...
Now if she could
just stop talking
for five seconds.
...Brussels sprouts, broccoli.
Oh, I got it,
I got it, I got it.
No, we'll get it.
I got it.
Hey, Lionel, come on,
you wanna help us eat
the centerpiece?
LIONEL: Can I, Dad?
Yeah, yeah.
Go ahead. Go crazy.
Bye.
If you don't, I will.
There was a lot going on
the other night.
And I didn't get to tell you
about Lionel's unique rhythm
and I'm sorry...
Oh, gosh, no, it's fine.
I actually feel
a kinship with him.
You know he can't stop
running around
and I can't stop talking.
I kind of think you're gonna
have your hands full.
They said it couldn't be done,
but I did it.
How was your date with the...
Oh, my gosh, Mom...
Mom, this is Johnny.
Johnny, this is my mom,
Daphne.
Hi. Oh.
Oh!
Lionel. Johnny's son.
John, is it?
Lionel. Come on, buddy.
Uh-huh.
Lionel, come on here now.
Pardon me.
MILLY: Johnny. That's Johnny.
Lionel, that's so cute.
Oh, my gosh. Oh, Mom.
The delivery man's here.
Is this menorah-esque?
Mom, I don't even know
if this is good.
Find something Hobbit-like.
I don't have anything
Hobbit-like.
We should try
and make this work, though.
They're never gonna never know
it's from Gelson's.
Oh, wait, wait.
I used this for Jason's party.
Jason has such
nice eyes. Okay.
Thank you.
Happy Bar Mitzvah,
Josh Greenberg.
How do you know Jason has
such nice eyes?
Does he? Oh, that's so sweet.
He seems like
a very special person.
What if we try that new vase
on the coffee table?
He is nice.
But actually, they both are.
Oh, I'm sure they both are.
But in terms of who you
wanna get serious with,
that Johnny, at least from
what I can see, can't even
get his life together.
But I'm gonna stop, all right?
You know what's wrong?
The couch is
in the wrong place. Look.
I got an idea.
Okay.
So we'll move the couch.
Which way?
Let's move it this way.
Here we go.
That's so good.
Okay, there we go.
I think it's good.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, my God, look at that.
It's so great.
It, like, completely opens
the room up.
So very, very, very good.
I love it.
The only thing is...
Can I just say this?
What?
We haven't tried the couch
by the window.
I think we should.
All right. I don't
even know if I see it here.
Okay. Oh, gosh.
Just a second. Hello?
You have the wrong number.
Yeah.
There is no J. Bond here.
FYI, the Eagle has landed.
Yeah, the hen is in the house.
Repeat, the hen is
in the house. Right now.
All right, honey?
Mil, if we push this
five inches to the left,
I swear it's gonna
transform your life.
You really think so?
I wouldn't lie to you.
All right.
Come on, let's go.
Okay, on three.
Yeah.
One, two, three.
This way. Mom?
Pick it up. Answer it.
Does he sound wonderful
or what? Why don't you
wanna talk to him?
I do wanna talk to him.
I just don't wanna do it
in front of you, all right?
Come on, Milly,
I mean I don't...
La Bohème.
Oh, come on,
sweetie, I love
Just pick up the phone.
Mom, I don't want to
talk to him.
Mil, Mil, pick up the phone.
Mom, stop. No, no, no,
don't pick up the phone.
Here, take it. Say yes.
Stop, stop.
Hi.
Yeah, I'm great.
Oh, great. Yeah, okay.
Mmm-hmm.
That sounds really great.
Great.
Yeah, great. Okay.
All right.
Okay, I'll talk to you soon.
Okay, great. Bye.
He obviously adores you.
You think so?
Oh, God, and who wouldn't?
But, hon, are you aware
of how many times
you used the word "great"?
These candlesticks gotta go.
No, no, no. I like them.
They're staying.
They're great.
Milly, you know how much
I hate to meddle,
but I once had the choice
between a mature,
responsible young man
like Jason,
and your father,
who, of course,
I was infatuated with.
And to this day...
Okay, okay.
You know what?
To be fair, you're reading
a lot into a guy that you've
met for ten minutes.
Truth be told,
that Johnny has heartbreak
written all over his face.
No, no, no. Truth be told,
you know absolutely
nothing about him.
And know what, Mom? I gotta go
'cause I'm getting
my bangs cut.
What?
No, no, you go ahead.
No, that's okay, you go ahead.
Yes.
Fine.
Cut your bangs and quit
hiding your incredible eyes.
To be truthful, you know
nothing about him.
He's actually a good parent.
Hiding your incredible eyes.
I can't do this.
Milly, I love you
and you may be brilliant,
but you're not smart.
I just want you to
have a full, beautiful life.
Do I not have a life, Mom?
Because I thought
I had a life.
No. No, you have a career,
you have a car
and you have a loft
you pay way too much rent for.
That's not a life.
Milly, I'm your mother.
I love you enough
to tell you the truth.
Your version
of the truth, Mom.
No. No.
The truth is, happiness
is a series of choices.
It's not something
that just sort of happens.
One wrong decision
can change your whole life.
There's still time, Mom.
Not if you waste
another minute of it.
I mean for you.
And I don't say
"great" too much.
MILLY: This is great.
This is great.
The view is great.
The night is just so great.
You warm enough?
You wanna go inside?
No, no, no, I'm fine.
I'm nice and toasty.
Okay, all right.
And don't you just love
my mom's orange blossom
cheesecake? So good.
Get a big bite.
Wow.
It's great, right?
It's superb, which is
a synonym for great, if you're
ever looking for one.
You know, you're cold.
Let's go inside.
You get the candle,
I'll get the rest.
Let me grab that.
Be careful with that.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Oh, my gosh, please tell me
where I can get you
another one...
You can't.
It's my great-grandmother's.
Oh, my God. Jason.
I don't know
what to say. I'm sorry.
Please, I'm just,
I've been so out of it lately.
My alarm clock
didn't go off today
and that's why I was late
and I've just been
so stressed with
the Greenberg Bar Mitzvah,
but that's a whole...
You just seem really angry.
Nope.
I'm great.
Okay.
MILLY: I promise you
they're the best
chocolate soufflés ever.
Well, they better be.
They're worth it.
Touchdown.
Oh, my gosh, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry.
Hey, it's all right.
That's all right.
I'm sorry. I bumped
into, like, a parking
meter yesterday
and I'm always breaking stuff.
Why are you apologizing?
It isn't even your fault.
Lionel, put some shoes on
before you come back
in here, all right?
Look, I know he can be a lot
and it gets a little crazy
around here sometimes.
But here you are making us
chocolate soufflés
and you're apologizing.
Sometimes, I think you let
people make you feel bad
about yourself.
Yeah, like you are right now?
What is going on
with us today?
We're having an off day,
that's all.
What are you doing?
I'm leaving.
I'm leaving because
you're miserable
and we're having a bad day.
You just admitted it.
No, I said "off day."
And, yes,
we've had better days,
and I'm sure we'll have
a few hundred more weird ones
if we stay together. So what?
Johnny.
Give me your hand.
What?
I'm going to
try something here.
What are you doing?
Just a little something.
Oh.
The soufflés are done.
No, the timer didn't go off.
No, no. I feel it.
I feel it. Watch.
Those look beautiful.
Thank you.
The one thing I can
actually do right.
You have perfect timing.
Thank you.
Come here.
Don't apologize.
He has this way
of calming me down.
A huge plus.
Yeah.
But then the whole
Lionel thing.
I just worry and wonder,
would I be a good mother
to him?
Don't worry.
It's not genetic.
They've been through
so much, though,
with Lionel's mom, like,
freaking out and splitting
when he was so young.
I don't know, not that we're
anywhere near talking
about any of this yet.
Just the fact
that you're wondering,
though. God.
I mean the fact is
you don't know either
of these guys that well.
Who knows if Jason
even wants to have kids?
JASON: Absolutely.
Four kids.
And I wanna name the first
one Charlie after my father
and that works
if it's a boy or a girl.
Then I want to design
a huge Craftsman house
for the whole brood.
The exhibit's in here.
Oh, no, no, no.
Don't let me in the museum.
Too many breakables.
Don't worry. They're insured.
Hey, listen.
I'm sorry I lost my temper
with you the other day.
You felt bad enough already.
I can be a real ass
and I hate that about myself.
Another family heirloom.
He buys jewelry.
Well, it's a no-brainer.
He's the one.
He felt remorse, Mae.
DAPHNE: Well,
that's a lovely quality.
No, he knew
he should feel remorse.
Oh, my God, Milly.
Those empanadas are amazing.
They're gonna be perfect
for Mom's party.
Oh, my party.
Mom, what about these
for your party?
Oh, shoes, please.
Why are you making
such a big deal
over this dreaded event?
Why are we celebrating
my descent into oblivion?
Come on, Mom.
It's not that bad.
Snap out of it.
Well, I mean, it is
a milestone, and actually,
I am taking stock of my life
and trying to find
some peace and quiet
in my old age,
so, Milly, will you please
bring Jason to the party?
I would just love to meet him.
That's all I'm asking.
I understand,
but isn't it my choice
who I bring?
I think it is.
Thank you.
All right.
Okay.
Oh.
Oh, my God.
Mom, Eli says
that's what I say
right before I...
No kidding? Me, too.
And, you know, it was funny,
the other night,
we hadn't had sex
in so long, by the third one,
I was setting off
the car alarms
in the neighborhood,
and dogs were barking...
Three? Is that normal?
Please. Everyone knows
I hold the record
in this family.
Why are you so quiet?
'Cause she's doing
the Oompa-Loompa
with two guys, Mom.
Stop it.
What?
DAPHNE: Wait a minute.
At this point,
are you doing it
with both of them at once?
No. I'm not. Absolutely not.
Honey, I've been thinking
about your situation
with Jason.
Mom, I didn't ask for this.
It happened to me.
So move on.
Things have gotten
so out of hand
I broke my first bundt cake.
Has anybody seen my G.I. Joe?
Believe me, it's not in here.
I left it on the bed.
...that it happened to you.
You're making me hate you
and I don't ever want to
see your face...
With that Johnny...
Happy birthday, Mom.
Happy birthday, Mom.
Happy birthday.
MILLY: Your favorite
butterscotch cake.
We made it.
MAGGIE: Well, some of us
made it.
MAE: We helped, okay?
It's really yummy.
I tried some.
All right.
Make a wish, make a wish.
Make a wish, Mom.
Come on, make a wish,
make a wish.
Make a wish, make a wish.
Happy birthday.
We love you, Mom.
I'd like to propose a toast.
To the incredibly unique
Daphne Wilder,
the fearless leader of
the Wilder women, who I hope
to someday call family.
You've created
a wonderful family,
and I hope when my folks
stop through town,
that Milly'll charm them
as much as she's charmed me.
Cheers.
Cheers.
Cheers.
Cheers.
WOMAN: Cheers.
Thank you so much.
Thank you, thank you.
What was that exactly?
Did you know
he was gonna do that?
Did he just propose?
Because I think
he just proposed.
I think he did.
The question is, to who?
Maggie, stop being a killjoy.
All right, girls,
what do you think?
He seems well-read.
He's tall.
Okay, you guys
don't like him at all.
Don't listen to your sisters.
For God's sake, sweetie,
do not listen to them.
Here's what I'm thinking.
I'm thinking his parents
are from Connecticut.
They're a little conservative,
so maybe you should
just wear your pleated skirt.
Just this once, honey?
Stop.
It's just a gesture,
just make them
more comfortable.
I understand it's a gesture
but, Mom,
this is moving very quickly.
He just said
all of this. It's...
Milly, don't fight it.
This is the way
it's supposed to be.
You're just not used
to feeling pursued and adored.
I hate pleated skirts.
Isn't this about the time
we were going to sing?
That's a great idea.
Come on, Mils.
Yes, yes.
My voice.
Not bad. What do you
got going, Mom?
Nice.
Yes.
Milly? Will you take
the soprano?
You know, that's it.
That's it.
No, no. You're so
out of control.
What'd I do this time?
You're forcing me.
Jason's here.
You're making me...
So, Jason, can I get you
another one of these?
Will I need one?
Oh, yeah.
They're just getting started.
Who wants lavender ice cream?
No, no, no.
No, no, no.
You're not gonna go.
You're out of control.
Milly's right.
I don't know how
she can take it.
I can't.
I can't take it anymore.
Well, excuse me for just
one moment here. I thought
that this was my birthday.
My very big, special birthday.
Yes, Mom. It's your big,
special birthday.
That's how you should remember
you're too old...
Old?
Not too old, but too old
to be doing this to Milly.
You're pushing her
like you pushed her
into Girl Scouts.
Thank you very much.
I'm not ten years old anymore.
You have to stop.
Yeah.
You have to change
at some point.
Fine. But I just want you
girls to understand something
about motherhood, okay?
Mom.
Okay?
MAGGIE: Yeah, okay.
I mean, it is the most
impossible love.
You tell me when it ends.
You tell me when it stops.
All I know is, it's absolutely
fine for me to teach you
how to walk and talk,
and then you grow up and you
head off in the wrong
direction toward a cliff.
And I'm supposed to just
stand there and wave and go,
"Well, kids, good luck.
It's Mom. I'm here."
Well, I can't do that.
What am I supposed to do, huh?
Am I supposed to just put my
feet up at the end of the day
and say to myself,
"Well, you know,
they're on their own
and she says she's fine."
Well, you won't be.
Just stop it. God damn it.
You are making me crazy
and you're never gonna change
'cause you don't even know
when you're doing it.
Oh, well, I am gonna stop
as in right now.
So, let me tell you,
I am washing my hands
of your emotional problems.
I'm just a visitor
with a limited day pass
from here on in.
Oh, my God, I can't even talk.
Mom.
Oh, my...
Great.
She loses her voice
and we are three days
from Hungarian flu.
You guys, the last time
I had her at my house,
Derek and I were in therapy
for two months.
I can't do it with this.
No, no, no. I know
it's my turn technically,
but you cannot...
We can't be in the same room
together right now.
Rock, Paper, Scissor.
Rock, Paper...
Fine, fine, fine.
Hi. Oh, Ma, I'll take that.
We know you're about to
get sick, so we're gonna
Rock, Paper, Scissors
to see whose house
you're gonna stay at.
'Cause you know what, Mom?
We all want you to stay.
We're fighting for you.
Let's declare, guys. Please?
Okay.
MAGGIE: Oh, you win, Mils.
That's great.
Have fun, you guys.
What?
"You don't need to
take care of me."
"Go out and have fun
with Jason."
No. No. Why?
"Because I said so."
No. I'm not leaving.
They say dogs feel disoriented
when they get debarked.
"Now there was a man
who knew how to be a man."
Mmm-hmm.
"There's turkey meatloaf
in the fridge."
"What's an orgasm feel like?"
Amazing?
I don't know. Amazing, and...
Like...
Like being
totally out of control.
Just like...
"No, I wouldn't like that."
Yes, you would.
Oh, Mom, no, no, no.
It's not like being drunk.
It's just satisfying and...
Like you're out of your body,
but you're in your body,
and your toes curl under...
That doesn't sound delicious,
I know, but, God,
it's so delicious, Mom.
And you can laugh or cry,
but like a good cry.
I mean, I've cried before.
It's just like...
You know, just...
Oh, my God,
I can't believe
I just said that to you.
I'm not explaining it right.
I'm not explaining it right.
Didn't you ever
have one with Dad?
"He said he didn't have
all day
and he worked nights."
Oh, Mom.
"Don't tell your sisters
I asked."
Hello?
No, I'm sorry.
She can't come
to the phone right now.
Can I take a message?
You're calling about
the personal ad?
Are you sure that you have
the right number?
Yeah, Daphne Wilder.
Okay. Bye-bye.
MILLY: Just a little
belated birthday gift.
You like it?
See, it brought me luck,
so I thought maybe
it would bring you luck.
Oh, do you like it, Mom?
Mom? I know.
I know all about
your little ad.
And I think it's so great.
It's so bold
and so brave of you
and finally it shows me
that you heard us
at your birthday party.
You're trying to live
your own life.
And I want you to know, Mom,
you don't have to go through
the personals to find love,
'cause that can be so...
Terrifying.
Jason's uncle is coming
into town next week
with his parents
and he's dying
to meet you, Mom.
Jason says he's, like,
the most amazing guy
in the entire world
and I haven't even
really told him about the...
All right, all right, fine.
Fine.
Hello.
Is this Milly Wilder's home?
I'm Joe Dresden,
I'm Johnny's father.
Are you Milly's mom?
This is Lionel,
this is Johnny's boy.
"Daphne."
"Can't talk."
Well, it's overrated.
Sign? Do you sign?
"Laryingitis."
Laryngitis.
That's the alternate
spelling, I guess.
I know Johnny had a date
with Milly tonight
and I was hoping to catch him.
I can't reach him
on his cell phone.
I stupidly misplaced my keys
and I can't get back
into our house.
They're beautiful.
Three girls, huh?
And all by yourself.
That couldn't have been easy.
Yeah, yeah, I know,
but still, it had to be tough.
"There's tougher things."
Yeah, like trying
to give you a compliment.
You know,
what could be good
for that throat
is a couple of drops
of brandy.
Mine's feeling
a little scratchy, too.
Hello.
MILLY: Hi.
JOHNNY: Hi.
Hi.
Hi.
We were worried sick
about you.
It's nice to see you
again, Milly.
You, too.
It's a great night, isn't it?
It's one for the books.
MILLY: Yeah.
She has a 'gina, too.
Lionel.
As Grants,
we Grant you health,
we Grant you happiness,
we Grant you someone else
to water your plants.
Cheers.
Definitely.
Cheers.
Reggie's the toast giver.
He's the real talker
in the family.
I see.
Can somebody get me
another bourbon and soda
on the rocks?
Oh, no, no, no,
you can't order bourbon...
They seem to be
hitting it off.
Definitely. Yeah.
Beautiful. I don't think so.
And then I want you to
try the buffalo filet
while we're here.
Yeah.
You know, the buffalo was an
endangered species up until
a couple of years ago
and now we're eating them.
Isn't this great, Mom?
...and you look out
over the fields
and what you see are herds
of commercial buffalo.
And then you also see
herds of...
I had a great time.
Please tell your parents
good night for me, okay?
Good night.
Good night.
Tell me you're not seeing
that guy. Are you, Milly?
Yes, but I don't...
Actually, the "yes"
is all I needed to know.
No, no, no,
but the "but" part's
really important too.
But what? Not him.
Why?
'Cause he looks like some guy
your mother would love.
Johnny, wait, though.
This is really difficult
for me and I've never
been here before.
I don't know how to
navigate this.
Oh, poor thing.
Don't talk to me that way.
Oh, I'm sorry.
What was I thinking?
You're involved with this guy
to the point where
you're meeting his family
and I should be careful
how I'm talking to you?
Are you sleeping with him?
I wouldn't say it that way.
Well, what way
would you say it?
Are you going to stop
seeing him?
That pause says it all.
No, it doesn't.
That's not true.
That's not true.
Who are you?
I can't even look at you.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
I'm gonna go check
on the soufflés.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
JASON'S MOTHER:
Jason's finally met
such a wonderful girl.
She's so sweet.
She has the loveliest spirit
about her.
But I still can't believe
he found her on the Internet.
Not like in our day.
That somehow reminds me
of people writing
a phone number
on the bathroom wall.
Sweetie, I think that
we should...
Are you dating somebody else?
What?
I just heard your mom
on the phone talk about
how you're dating some girl
you met on the Internet.
Oh, it's nothing
like that at all.
I'm surprised
and I don't even know
if I have the right to be,
'cause to be honest,
I feel like I need to tell you
that I'm also dating
somebody else.
Well, first of all, to be
honest, you didn't need to
be so honest.
I'm not seeing anyone but you.
But since we're being honest,
this is something
that I was saving for later.
What?
My mother's personal ad?
Oh, my God.
You sounded just like her
there.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Hey, hey, hey.
What does it matter
how we met?
You and my mom have been
totally scheming
and now I know exactly
why she pushed me on you.
Because she was voting
for you. She found you.
Yeah, and it doesn't
take anything away from us.
What matters is that
we did meet and how good
this is between us.
And the truth of that...
The truth? Where's the truth?
Where's the truth?
Because you've been living
a lie and I've been
lying to you, Jason.
And it doesn't
change anything.
How does that not
change everything?
Because you're here.
I think you already
made your choice.
But if it helps, I'll say it.
Stop seeing him.
Then you and I can get closer.
Close enough to spend
the rest of our lives
together.
I knew I had you
the day I met you.
How could you know
something like that?
'Cause you were so nervous,
you laughed like a hyena
in that beautiful polka dot
dress of yours.
Really?
Mmm-hmm.
I'll tell you one thing,
though.
You did not have me
the moment that we met
because I wasn't even sure
that I liked the fact
that your staff talked
about you behind your back
at the dessert table.
And, excuse me,
but, truth be told,
I didn't like anything
that you ordered for me
on our first date,
except the calamari.
And okay, fine, yes,
it was nice to not have
to think for a change,
but who wants someone
who doesn't think?
Look, and sometimes you laugh
when I cry and say, "Huh?"
when I make perfect sense.
And never, ever, in my life
have I burned a chocolate
soufflé until now
and that, in and of itself,
oh, my God, should have
told me I don't feel
like myself around you.
And I would have decided that
a long time ago
if it weren't for my mother.
Because who wants someone
who laughs like a hyena
in a polka dot dress
that my mother made me buy?
I love that dress.
Take her out.
Hey.
Stuart, this is an emergency.
Well, should I wait?
Let's reschedule.
But I'm suicidal.
Oh, wow, this is making me
feel like when I was
the last pick in kickball...
Right and that's exactly
where we'll begin next week.
Maggie, you promised me
after Willie Matthews,
you would never
lie to me again.
Oh, Milly Woo, Milly Boo.
Stop.
Well, I'm sorry.
Mommy made me promise
not to say anything
or she'd be furious.
Mommy?
Mommy made you promise?
Where is your own moral code?
Your adulthood?
Your sisterhood?
Just...
I'm feeling rejected by you.
Okay.
And it's bringing up memories
of summer camp
when Jimmy Feldon and
Eric Fishman both transferred
out of my bunk.
I totally understand, Stuart.
Come back today
and we'll do a two-hour
session at 3:00 p.m.
Listen, you're right.
I didn't handle this well
and I understand
you feel betrayed.
But, really,
isn't some of this anger
a little misplaced?
No, no, Maggie.
It's placed exactly
where it should be.
And there is plenty to
go around, so don't worry,
Mom will be getting hers.
Okay...
Maggie.
Stuart, I am asking you
to empower yourself and leave.
This could be a huge day
for you, Stuart.
This makes me feel like when
I was 13 and no one came
to my bar mitzvah.
Why didn't they come?
I don't get it.
Stuart, you have
a blood sugar problem, okay?
Just get some lunch,
you'll be fine.
Honey, I know this is painful.
Do you have any snacks
in here?
Third shelf on the right.
Honey, instead of blaming Mom,
you should really focus on
the fact that both of these
guys went along with it.
I am, I am. Because
I just told Jason that...
Guys...
Guys?
That was plural, wasn't it?
I feel like I don't know
what you guys
are talking about
and it's making me feel
very much out of the loop,
and it's making me want
to jump out the window.
Stuart. For ten years,
my sister has sat here
and told me that you're
about to commit suicide.
Well?
You mean she's been
talking about me?
Wow. God.
Mom? Are you there?
Pick up the phone, Mom.
Hello?
Oh, my God.
Oh, thank you, dear God.
Mom.
Mom.
DAPHNE: Yeah.
Yeah?
DAPHNE: Yes!
Oh, my God.
Yes, oh, yes!
Oh, my God!
Yes. Yes.
Yes!
Okay, so the orange-cranberry
muffins are in here?
They're in there.
And the ones with the nuts
are in here too?
They're in there, too.
I had a little trouble
with the frosting,
but I know how much
you love butter cream.
Mother, I told you
on the phone I need distance.
Okay. But it's a new recipe.
Tangerine instead of orange.
For a clean slate?
Why don't you get it?
I don't want to see you.
Milly, if I'm guilty of any
crime, it's just that I've
just loved you too much.
Here.
Milly?
It was just so you. I...
Milly?
This isn't the way
it was supposed to be.
Welcome to life.
Yeah, but I mean,
how can I be happy
if she's not happy, hmm?
What am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do?
What are... Nothing.
Just do nothing.
Hopefully, you still have
a mental picture of me.
We have the same hands
and earlobes
and love of Bauer pottery.
and I respect that.
that I found Grandma's recipe
for your favorite
Lady Baltimore cake.
The one from my
third birthday.
The one from
your third birthday.
Obviously,
he has more character.
I mean,
he's really a good guy.
He was just an
innocent bystander.
I know that I'm
saying too much.
I've learned my lesson.
Good.
Because, Milly,
it's your life.
Yup, that's right.
That's absolutely right.
But, Milly,
if you're in any way
still pulled to Johnny,
then please don't let
your pride or our differences
come between you
and getting what you want
otherwise, honey,
you're gonna end up
like some pathetic character
Believe me,
I know what I'm talking about.
Okay.
Milly...
I never meant to
hurt you, sweetie.
And I promise I will never
ever interfere ever again.
I guess
what I'm trying to say is
that I was just
trying to protect you
from becoming me.
My sweet girl.
Mom?
Hi, honey.
I miss you.
I miss you, too.
Solo on the four chord.
Alternate the bass line,
will you?
Too late for spring sign-up.
I've actually been here
before.
I came once on a Tuesday
when it was closed,
and I just wanted to...
You know, I can't hear you.
I'm sorry.
Please.
I miss you.
I miss us
and I'm not seeing anybody.
That doesn't change
anything for us, Milly.
Yeah, but Johnny, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry,
I'm so deeply sorry,
and I wish I could find
a less cliché word
for sorry, but...
It was an aberration.
It's not who I am,
and I know
we can't start over,
but maybe we could...
Maybe we could try this again.
I need to get back up there.
LIONEL: Okay, you're driving
a bus. Seven hundred
and fifty people get on.
Two get off.
Thirty thousand
seventy-one get on.
Four hundred and five
get off.
A thousand get on
and nine hundred
and ninety-nine get off.
Get off.
What color are
the bus driver's eyes?
I don't know.
I said you're driving the bus.
Get it, dummy?
You dummy.
Dummy.
You did say that, Lionel.
That's right. That's so good.
He did.
That is so great.
That is so great.
Want to hear it again?
Well, I mean, I don't know.
Actually, I thought
you really nailed it
that last time, so...
Didn't he?
Just one more time. Please?
Okay.
Okay, you're driving a bus.
Five people get off.
Six people get on.
Really?
Seven hundred
and seventy-five thousand
get on.
Seven hundred
and thirty-five million
and one...
Oh, no.
Hey, guys.
You know, I forgot
a few things at the market.
I'm just gonna...
I'll be right back.
Dad, Dad, you got to
hear this punch line.
Yeah, yeah. You really,
really... You have to
stick around for this.
Think you got to, Johnny.
LIONEL: Okay, now.
What is it?
You are driving a bus.
Yeah.
A billon million catrillion
get on.
I cannot believe
you are here.
You are truly insane.
Two hundred billion million
get off.
Well, I... This is
a surprise to you?
Daphne, you're not listening.
Honey, oh, no, no.
I swear, of course,
I'm listening.
Okay. Dad and Daphne.
You're driving a bus.
Five hundred catrillion
cazillion get on.
But zero...
Lionel, look.
A blimp.
Where?
Right there.
I can't see it.
Right there. Look harder.
Where? Show me.
I can't see it.
Up, up. Look harder.
I've wanted to talk to you
for the past few days
and I haven't had the nerve.
That I find hard to believe.
Johnny, you have
too much pride.
I prefer to call it
common sense.
It's pride,
and it's a quality
you and I share.
It's an admirable one,
until it becomes a wall.
"Well, yes, I am alone,
"but at least
I have my righteous anger
to keep me company at night."
Come on, that's not a life,
and you know it.
And let's face it.
I mean, if it wasn't for me,
obviously Milly
never would have betrayed you
in the first place.
So what are you doing, Johnny?
What are you doing?
Why waste one more minute
of your life?
And I'm right.
I'm so right.
Damn it.
For once, she is.
Jeez, you guys,
no one's listening.
If Milly was here,
she would get my joke.
You're driving a bus.
Ten people get on.
Ten people get off.
Thirty thousand get on.
Thirty thousand get off.
A million get on...
See, that's the fun
of the tuna pasta toss,
'cause it's delicious
and it's easy,
because when
you're cooking for one,
it's really important
to look forward to
the end result. You know?
JOHNNY: What if you want to
make it for two?
It's a little bit
more complicated,
but I think it can be done.
I see some of you
have gone ahead
and already
added your carrots
and your pickled relish.
And remember
that some people like dill.
Even before I met you,
I had an instinct about you.
And once I saw
you were a woman
with profound static cling,
I wanted to be
that force around you.
Personally, I love dill.
I think it's not used enough
and very underrated,
sort of, like, mayonnaise,
and I also really love
olive oil for tuna.
I love that
when I breathe you in,
you smell of cake batter.
And I love that
you have this insane way
of talking in circles
that makes perfect sense.
I do?
'Cause sometimes
I feel like
nobody understands me but...
Me.
I get you.
That's wonderful.
But, you know,
my bladder is about to pop.
Can you hold it for a minute?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, guys.
Where were we?
With the tuna pasta
and the tuna noodle doodles,
tuna sandwiches, tuna...
I love your eyes.
I even love
your mother.
MILLY: Well, we gotta
get this show on the road.
MAGGIE: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Where is she?
Well, it should have started
That's not like her.
I mean, the ceremony
has to start soon.
I don't know
where she is, though.
Oh, my God.
I'm worried.
I hope she's okay.
Just call her.
All right. I'm calling.
It's her own wedding.
Oh, no.
No.
Hi, honey.
Hi, Mom. Where are you?
Honey, I just have to
talk to you a little
bit later, okay? Mil...
Oh, my God. I kind of think
she's having sex
with Joe right now.
Great.
Awesome.
Would she like us to explain
that to all the guests,
or just the preacher?
She is a woman after
my own heart.
All right, Mom?
We are gonna give you
five more minutes.
Ten. Ten.
Mom. Come on.
Open up
the champagne, sweetie.
What's the rush?
Because I said so.
Are we married or what?
MAN: All right.
