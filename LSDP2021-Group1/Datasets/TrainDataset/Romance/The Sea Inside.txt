Easy.
Diazepam, five milligrams.
Easy now, Mr. Cable,
you're gonna be fine.
Just having a nightmare.
Let it go Mr. Cable.
Whatever it is,
you have to let it go.
Where am I?
You're in a hospital.
Saint Jude's.
I'm doctor Jeremy Newman.
I've been assigned
your case.
You were admitted
last night.
Don't you remember?
That's okay.
Perfectly normal after
that kind of trauma.
What happened?
Paramedics were called
just after midnight.
They found you, right
in front of your house.
You had violent choleric
abdominal convulsions.
I'm afraid we had to evacuate
your stomach contents.
And?
It's just, uh...
I apologize...
I've never had to tell
a patient this before.
We're a small hospital
and painfully short-staffed.
I'm actually a pediatric
doctor by training so
any bad news
I have to give
usually involves a lollipop.
Would you like one?
It's grape.
Doctor, please.
You died, Mr. Cable.
Your heart stopped beating
for nearly two minutes.
No, no, it's alright.
We resuscitated you.
We brought you back.
You're good as new
well, practically.
So, that's why I'm here.
Now, over the next
few days, we'll...
run a series of tests to...
My name is Simon Cable.
I was born on
July 4th, 1974.
My parents were
Catherine and Leonard.
My father owned
a publishing company.
My mother ran charities.
I have one older brother
Peter.
You can ask me anything
I'm...
fine.
That's the spirit.
This won't take long.
Okay, so
do you remember my name?
Dr. Newman... Justin.
Jeremy, that's okay, nobody
around here remembers it anyway.
Um, and the date?
It's the...
Uh, have I missed a day?
No, it's friday.
Then it's uh...
God, I've always been
terrible with dates.
Well, that, that's okay
don't worry about it.
Um, how about the month?
What month do you
think it is?
It's uh, summer, maybe?
How about the year?
Well, last year was 1999.
So, this year is 2000.
It's the year 2000, right?
Uh, your wife's name?
Simon, this is the
The year is 2002.
And your wife
whose name is Anna
is waiting outside.
Back that truck out now!
Get these cars out of here!
We're gonna to need
some backup here!
Hey, come out here.
Are you alright?
You okay?
Take it easy man, I'm going to
take you on a little trip.
You okay? Just hang in there now.
Won't be long.
- What have we got?
- We got trauma...
Let's move on.
Saline, stabilize the heart.
Watch your backs.
Make it jolly.
Help me move.
Make that bolder.
His name is Simon Cable.
One, two, three.
Time is twenty hundred hours.
He's crashed, he's crashed!
Get the defrib!
Start chest compression.
One, two, three, four, five.
One, two, three, four, five.
One, two, three, four, five.
One, two, three, four, five.
One, two, three, four, five.
One, two, three, four, five.
No pulse.
Been flat.
Get someone from
surgery down here, pedals.
One hundred.
Charging!
Clear! No change.
Two hundred.
Charging! Clear!
There's nothing to explain
Dr. Newman.
His synoptic cholinesterase
is practically non-existent.
I really don't wanna be
discussing this right now.
What I need is coffee.
Poisonings have
suspicious need.
You have to come report it
to the police.
That's hospital policy.
Let's rule everything out first,
that's all I'm saying.
Diazepam, five milligrams.
Take it easy, Mr. Cable.
You're gonna be fine.
Just having a nightmare.
Let it go Mr. Cable.
Whatever it is
you just have to let it go.
So what we're looking at here
is anterior grade amnesia.
Basically short term
memory loss.
Nothing to get
too worried about.
Nothing to get
too worried about?
These episodes usually
sort themselves out
in a couple of days
a couple of weeks.
You're telling me that
I've lost two years of my life?
Think of it as if
your life's a puzzle
that's been jumbled up.
All the pieces are
still there
we just have to put them
back together.
Fit them in the right
order and place
and, honestly, Simon
I love a good puzzle.
And I have a wife?
Yeah, these situations are
tough on couples
but your wife will
help us with this.
She could be the key.
So, if you're
feeling up to it
I'll go and get her.
What do you think, Simon?
Would you like me
to get your wife?
Simon?
God! Simon.
I was so scared.
I called every hospital.
I didn't sleep at all.
Give me a break now.
The doctor says
i'll be just fine.
Oh, my god
what happened to you?
You have no idea
how scared I was.
For a moment lactually felt
what it would be like
if you weren't in my life.
I just completely lost it.
You know
it was kind of pathetic.
What's the matter?
Are you hurting?
Dr. Newman hasn't told you
what's happened to me, has he?
Now you're
freaking me out, sir.
I've lost my memory.
I can't remember anything
about the past two years.
I don't even know
how I got here last night
and I don't know
who you are.
What are you doing, Simon?
Telling you the truth.
I'm sorry.
I don't know you, at all.
You're serious?
With everything
that's happened
this is how you're
going to tell me?
Wait a second.
I don't think you understand.
- Are you crazy, Simon?
- I don't know what happened.
I have nothing left.
Wait! Please!
Anna!
Anna!
Whoa, Mr. Cable. Whoa, stop.
Stop her!
- Stop who?
- My wife!
- There's no one here
- What are you talking about?
No aerobics for at least
a week, Simon.
Dr. Newman, will you please
stop my wife?
Stop her?
She's not going anywhere.
You have to tell her
what's happened to me.
- I have, Simon
- No, you haven't!
Yes, he has, Simon.
Thank god, you're okay.
The kids I work with can't
get enough of these things.
I love watching their
eyes light up
when they finally
put it all together.
It's just amazing.
Anyway, in order to recover
what you've lost, Simon
we need to find
two points in time
and join them.
So, let's begin with the last memory
you can recall two years ago.
Can you tell us
what happened last night?
I wasn't with you
last night.
He has no memory
of any of it.
Your role, Anna
will be to help him
put his life back together.
Our life.
- It was our life.
- Of course.
Last night I was at home.
You were up here.
I don't know what happened.
Peter.
- I must have been visiting Peter.
- Peter?
Peter is my brother.
He lives up here.
He moved into our parent's
estate after my mom died.
We don't really
get along, but...
That's the only reason
I'd be up here, right?
Simon, honey.
Peter's dead.
What?
Peter died before we met.
There's no fucking way.
I was going to see him
just last night.
You didn't see
Peter last night.
He means his last night
the last night he can remember.
There was rain
and this light.
Then everything's quiet.
No rain.
No light, just...
Oh, gosh, he's talking
about the car accident.
Just this empty void
and I'm lost in it.
It happened right
before we met, Simon.
I don't know that much,
Just that you were up
here to see Peter.
I don't even know why
you never used to like
to talk about your brother.
There was a fight over
their father's estate.
Maybe you read about it.
Anyway after the accident
this is the hospital you were
taken to, I know that much.
Wait a minute.
I was here before?
I really need a cigarette.
So, we have our two moments
Simon.
Both were accidents.
Both led you to St Jude's.
I can't remember.
It doesn't make sense.
None of this makes
any fucking sense.
Two days ago
you came up here
to close up your
parents' house.
It's been sitting here
for two years, ever since...
Anyway, you finally
agreed to let it go.
You were going
to pack up the furniture
fix some of the fixtures
finish the old staircase and
refinish?
Interesting.
Not really, it's a gorgeous place
but it's falling apart.
No, no, what I mean is.
Well, one or two of Simon's
enzyme counts are lower than normal.
But I thought you said
I was okay.
I said practically, kid.
But your lower enzymes
are an indication
that somehow your
bloodstream was poisoned.
Are you saying someone
tried to poison him?
I'm not trying
to say anything.
But it's highly possible
that your condition was
caused by fumes
from certain cleaning
solutions or varnishes
trapped in an enclosed space.
- So now what?
- Well, you'll be fine.
We've got you an Atropane.
We'll reactivate your
Cholinesterase
with one of the Doximes.
The sooner you can eat
something, the better.
I've scheduled an M.R.I.
To make sure that
everything is a okay.
So, if you'll excuse me.
I'm sure you've seen enough
of me to last you a lifetime.
I'll check back in
with you in a few...
Anna?
You can drop the pretense now
you smug fuck.
My god, I knew you were
a good liar.
But this performance
is unbelievable!
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.
Then I'd pay
closer attention.
Don't think you're going to win
this little game of yours.
Because I'm a much better
player than you are.
This is about her
isn't it?
Do you think
I'm that blind?
Is she really worth this?
All of it?
Who are you talking about?
I'm talking about you.
A rich little daddy's boy
in way over his head.
This would actually be sad
if you weren't so pathetic.
Wait!
You said Peter was dead.
Of course he's dead.
You killed him.
Knock knock, mr. Cable
it's time for your M.R.I.
What happened?
Ask him.
Sleep well, honey.
You... hey!
Come on, home boy.
I'm gonna take you
on a little trip.
This isn't happening,
Man, I didn't think
you could get any whiter.
But you look like
you've seen a ghost.
You have to lie here.
So?
What'd make someone
wanna kill a nice
all-american dude
like you?
What?
Who said what? Relax, man.
It's just a rumor.
Everyone talks about
everything around here.
Especially nurse Clayton.
Arms down, please.
Nobody was trying
to kill me.
It was just chemical
I was using on the stairs.
Right, yeah.
Fumes must've got to you.
Keep your head still.
Anyway, my point is this:
everybody dies
no mystery there.
But why and how
everyone dies?
That is a mystery
we would solve.
Probably the biggest
mystery there is.
Man, you're not
making any sense.
I'm not the one who can't
remember what year it is.
Okay.
- What's your name?
- Travis.
Straps, too tight?
Travis, are you going out of
your way to make me nervous?
Hell no, if I wanted
to scare you
I'd just tell you about
the number of tumors
these machines cause.
you hang tight now.
I don't wanna be around
when this thing starts leaking.
I mean scanning.
Dr. Newman will be right along
see you later.
Thanks, Travis.
Hey! You, in there.
Fuck.
who is it?
Doctor Newman?
I know this sounds ridiculous
but I've got this...
terrible itch on my nose.
Who is there?
Hey, I don't suppose
you can unstrap me for...
Hello?
Hello?
What are you doing?
My name is Simon Cable.
You want to check
the chart or something?
I don't think I need that!
Get off me.
Get the fuck off me!
Somebody! Somebody help me!
Somebody help me!
Sweet jesus.
what the hell just happened?
What are you, some kind of
a lunatic or something?
Who's that?
This is a hospital pal,
not a nuthouse!
Oh, hey doc!
Glad you could make it.
We got a live one here!
- How did I just get here?
- Just get into bed, Mr. Cable.
You shouldn't be up
and about, not yet.
Who are you?
Someone just tried
to kill me.
- Yeah, wacko!
- Mr Travitt, enough.
Giving him some positive
reinforcement, doc.
This is Saint Jude's
hospital.
Do you know
why you're here?
I was just in the M.R.I. room
I was strapped down mister...
No, Mr. Cable, you were admitted
into this room last night.
Now, do you know
why you're here?
I wasn't in this room
last night.
I was alone...
in a private room.
- No offense taken.
- Mr. Cable, look at me.
All I want you to do
is to answer my one question.
Do you know why you are in
the Saint Jude's hospital?
Yes, because of the
staircase.
See, I just need
to talk to my wife.
- Your wife?
- Just find dr. Newman.
He'll know where she is.
We don't have a Dr. Newman
on our staff, mr. Cable
Now, please look, if you
don't calm down I'm...
What do you mean
you don't have a Dr. Newman?
- I was with him all last night!
- Mr. Cable, please!
The doctor who was
here today
a pediatrician.
I talked to him
for about a half hour.
Mr. Cable, please
listen to me.
You have been unconscious
since your car accident.
No, no, it wasn't
an accident.
It was poisoning
you must not have been on duty.
You've been involved in a
serious road accident
and the trauma has obviously
affected your memory.
- A car accident?
- Yeah.
And you're lucky
to be alive, actually.
- Last night?
- Yeah.
That's impossible!
Swell going, doc.
You calmed him right down.
What are you running
away from, Mr. Cable?
What were you
hoping to find?
Your mind's playing tricks
on you mr. Cable, that's all.
- There was no poison?
- No, I'm sorry.
And there is no Dr. Newman
on the staff at this hospital.
Look, you've been
unconscious.
So the oxygen supply
throughout your system.
- What's the date?
- What?
The date today?
- July 29th, why?
- And the year?
- The year?
- Yeah, what year is it?
So you're telling me
that it's the year 2000
and I've been in a car accident.
That I wasn't poisoned
and there is no
doctor Newman.
Yeah, that's right.
What about my wife?
- Your wife?
- Yeah, my wife.
actually, your admission
papers have you down
as being single,
Mr. Cable.
Okay, I've just spent
the entire day
wandering this hospital
talking to a Dr. Newman.
My wife, a mystery woman
Orderly named Travis.
Now, you want me to believe
that none of this happened?
You want a cup of coffee?
I'm not crazy.
I can't be.
I don't doubt you believe
what you believe, mr. Cable
The mind is a remarkable thing
Perhaps your mind is
showing you
something you need to see.
So being poisoned
and nearly murdered
this is what I need
to see?
It's not for me to say.
I have been in this
hospital before
but two years from now.
This is not my mind playing
tricks on me, this happened.
And this is where you met
a Dr. Newman
and an orderly named travis?
Yes, will meet.
You know, it's possible
you could be suffering
from a preoccupied delusion
Mr. Cable.
- It wasn't a delusion.
- Just consider.
While you were unconscious
you fabricated a story
then stored it deep
within your memory banks.
So that now awake
when you look back on it
it appears as real as
any true memory.
It was as real as
these walls, or you.
Even when you're unconscious
your senses are alive.
You have overheard things
and then incorporated them
into your delusion.
You said Travis, the patient
in your room is Travitt.
You met a Dr. Newman
I'm Truman.
It's like in a dream.
You think you heard a siren
and then when you're wake
you realize
it's only your alarm.
Hey, wacko, you know
what I've been thinking?
I swear I know you
from somewhere, I mean
Were you anybody
been in the papers or anything?
What about Anna?
Is she also just part of the dream?
Yes, Mr. Cable, I would
venture that she is.
I just want to remember.
I have to.
Sorry to interrupt, doctor.
I wanted to bring in
one of my nursing students
to check Mr. Hungout's
vitals if that's okay.
That's fine, nurse Clayton
go right ahead
okay, what the hell
was she doing here?
- It's just nurse Clayton?
- But she was in my dream.
Mine, too, hey what's
she wearing in yours?
How are you today?
That's... but you said...
what? What is it?
That's... she's my wife!
Anna?
Yes?
Anna have you been here
in the last 24 hours?
No, is everything
okay, doctor?
Mr. Cable, I need you to
get into bed right now.
How could I know her name, huh?
How could I?
I know who you are.
I got it.
You're the son of that
dead rich guy, aren't you?
You're all in on this
You're all out of your
fuckin' minds!
I know I was here!
I was in this goddamned room!
Anna!
Tell him you know me!
- A Dactyl ten.
- Tell him you know me!
Mr. Cable, just come
and sit down, will ya?
- It wasn't a dream!
- I know.
- That was real, and this isn't.
- Just relax.
This is bullshit!
What are you doing?
This is for your own good.
No! No, please
- That's it.
- I'm telling you.
You're not real!
Who's there?
What do you want?
What do you want?
Get away from me!
Doctor!
Doctor, doctor, doctor!
- Has to be on the door.
- You're gonna hurt yourself.
This is around that
goddamn door!
Keep your head still.
- Mr. Newton...
- Someone behind that door!
- Nurse?
Please!
He's right there!
- Five milligrams Diazefam
- No, no!
Simon, listen very carefully
to what I'm saying.
You've been prescribed
a drug that's known to have
mild psychiatric
side effects.
No one in the hospital
who's gonna kill you.
There's no one behind the door
Well if you're so sure
then look.
Simon, please.
Look behind the
fucking door!
Okay, I know.
Just look behind the door.
Not to see if there is someone there
but to prove to me that
there isn't someone there.
This will relax you.
C ward I'll join you
there in a minute.
Don't leave!
Don't you leave me!
Simon, I have other
patients who need me
but they're not
about to die!
Neither are you.
And that's a promise.
Goddamn you people!
Mr. Cable, please have some
consideration for others.
Then get me off this thing.
The doctor's orders
were quite clear.
Yeah, I know, I know
but I'm claustrophobic
One hand.
Yeah, well, it'll keep you
quiet for a moment.
But just a moment.
Mr. Cable, I am not
going to fight you.
What I will do is
call security.
Mr. Cable, you're meant
to stay here
until you're ready to...
What are you looking for?
He was here.
I know he was.
It's 2002.
Someone just tried
to kill me.
I promise you, kid,
that is not true.
- Pralidoxime is known.
- You're not listening to me.
Someone tried to kill me
before the nightmare
Just after that orderly
left me
strapped to that
goddamned machine.
You've got to believe me
someone came into the room...
Take it easy, kid.
Try and relax.
Take a breath.
Good, okay.
Now, I wanna show you
something I think may help,
And that's me
waking you up.
Keep your head still.
No masked intruders
my friend.
It was so real
I, I just...
Under the influence of
some psychoreactive drugs
nightmares can be
indistinguishable from reality.
It couldn't have been
a nightmare.
You saw it
for yourself, Simon.
You were all alone
in that room.
I know I was here two years
ago, after my accident.
See now that's good.
I told you to start
remembering.
And the quicker
that happens
the quicker you accept
what really happened
the quicker you'll finally
be able to move on.
Yeah, but still, I...
It wasn't as if I was
remembering the past.
It was as if I was
part of it.
I could interact
with the people there.
I got it figured out then.
Maybe whoever it was that came
after you
was part of your memory too.
That's why he never
showed up on the tape.
I'll just sit here
and look pretty.
Was there ever
a Doctor Truman here?
Truman?
That vaguely rings a bell.
Yes, 'cause I remember
nurse Clayton.
And uh, and a
patient named Travitt.
No shit? There's a
Travitt on the fifth floor.
- What?
- Yeah.
Heart transplant patient.
Been waiting here
about two years.
May I help you?
I'm just uh...
Looking up a friend.
But it's two o'clock
in the morning.
What the fuck are you
looking at?
I'm so glad to see you.
Hey, got a cigarette?
No, he hasn't.
How you doing, doc?
Mr. Cable, I think we should
leave Mr. Travitt to sleep.
Oh, no.
Plenty of time to sleep
when you unplug me
from all this shit.
Don't you recognize me?
Grim reaper?
We were in this hospital
together two years ago.
They come and they go.
Come on, Mr. Travitt.
Please.
- Think back, 2 years.
- It doesn't matter.
Yes, it does!
I was in this hospital
two years ago I know I was
and he was here with me!
Holy shit, wacko!
Are you sure, Mr. Travitt?
Abso-fucking-lutely, yeah.
This guy almost
shouted the place down.
I see they won't let you
escape from this place either.
It wasn't a delusion then.
I was here two years ago.
It was real.
This is good.
Isn't it, doc?
Isn't it?
So you think you're feeling up
to a few more questions?
Simon Cable, born July 4th.
- My name?
- Dr. Newman, Justin?
Jeremy, close enough.
And the date?
Is it tomorrow?
Then it's the
I'm impressed, kid.
Who's the president?
Don't worry about it.
Let's get you back
down to your room.
Is uh, Mr. Travitt ever going
to make it out of here?
There's only one inescapable rule
in the game of life, kid.
Sooner or later everybody
has to stop playing.
Whoops, that's me.
I think it'd be better
if you've got some sleep.
Thank you, doctor.
I know I haven't been easy.
Of course
we're not done with you yet.
We have a puzzle downstairs.
That still needs to be
put together.
I think I just might
be up for that now.
Okay.
Simon?
Where have you been?
I've been looking
everywhere for you.
I know, I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have run off.
I just...
It just seemed so cruel
what you were saying.
You have to believe me.
I'm not making this up.
I'm not trying to hurt you.
I honestly don't remember
who you are.
The doctor swears
my memory will return, but
It just might
take some time.
I've got time.
I'll help you.
If I did something
to hurt you...
Claire.
My name is Claire.
Going down?
Yeah.
Sorry.
Freight elevator's broken.
This never happens.
This never usually happens.
You're going back up
I assume?
Yeah, we must have
missed our floor.
There's one thing
I don't understand.
How, how can you and I.
- I thought I was...
- You're married.
Yeah.
I don't regret it, Simon.
Any of it.
it was you.
Anna knew.
No, she didn't.
That's impossible.
Yes, she did, something.
She said, she, she knew.
She was pissed.
I mean, really pissed.
You don't love her, Simon.
What we have is
something really amazing.
Anna doesn't matter.
I know what we were
and what you felt.
It's just waiting
to be remembered.
Some things just
don't get lost.
I don't know
what to believe anymore.
I'll come back then.
- wWe'll just take this slow.
- Claire, wait!
I love you, Claire.
Finally, he says it.
Yeah, but don't leave me
out here all exposed.
I love you too, Simon.
I wish I didn't, but I do.
I think this is my favorite
room in the whole house.
All these things growing.
I could live in here.
Back in a minute.
Simon, what we just
said to each other.
It's serious.
I know.
I really don't need
this drama, you know?
I don't think
we have a choice.
We always have a choice,
Simon.
I remember...
What?
The sunroom...
You...
I remember loving you
I told you
some things just
don't get lost.
Sometimes...
I can't help but
think that
we're paying for
what happened.
What do you mean?
I'll come back.
Think of me.
Claire?
Claire?
Claire!
How about a glass of water?
Since you're up.
What the hell
are you doing here?
You're not going to start acting
funny on me, are you?
How the hell did you get down
here? You were just up...
Off we go.
- It's the year 2000, isn't it?
- All year.
You know, the egyptians have
these things called calendars.
- You might wanna get one
- Mr. Travitt.
Will you please stop
pressing that button?
Wacko is flying
high again, doc.
Give him a shot in the ass
with something or break my balls.
How are you feeling
right now?
Any dizziness?
Shortness of breath?
No.
I have some difficult
news for you.
Concerning your brother.
We did everything
we could for him.
Is there anyone we can
contact for you?
Your parents or...
No, both our parents
are dead.
I don't know what friends
he had up here.
The last few years
we didn't really
get together that much.
If it makes you feel any better
you donated blood to
your brother last night.
What did he need
my blood for?
I needed a transfusion
after the accident.
He was with me?
Wait, I, I thought
I had the accident before.
Great.
H.G. Wells
back from the future.
It's been a long night.
You're completely loony
you know that, don't you?
So, you want to talk about
horse racing?
What?
Tomorrow morning, they're
going to open me up
and cut out my heart.
Gonna replace it with
mechanical pump that's
supposed to keep me going until
my transplant comes through.
I like playing the horses.
I like long shots.
I mean, if this is the
last conversation
I'm ever going to have
I'd, I'd like...
Ah, forget it.
You're not going to die.
So, you're a doctor now?
No, time traveler.
Just like you said.
I've seen tomorrow.
Trust me.
You're not gonna die.
You feel up to
seeing her now?
And who would that be?
Your brother's fiance.
Why not?
Thanks.
Hi, I'm Simon.
It's so nice to
meet you.
Jesus.
No.
Sorry?
There's no way
you are engaged to him.
Not even in my
twisted head.
I was just having
some coffee, I...
I wasn't really
looking to get married.
Actually, now that
you're here
I do have a couple
of questions for you.
Yeah?
About what?
The car accident
last night?
And about your brother
I need you in the ICU
Miss Hathaway.
Okay, we can finish
this later.
We can finish what later?
Simon?
Claire?
Jesus, are you okay?
I've been thinking about you
but every time...
It's true about Peter.
You were engaged to him?
Oh, my god.
How could this be happening?
You were with Peter
and I knew?
Simon, stop, what's
wrong with you?
We were having an affair?
He was my brother, Claire.
- Don't do this, not now.
- Well didn't you loved him?
Stop it.
Did you ever love him?
Of course I loved him.
things change.
You know all this, Simon.
And us? Why?
I guess now we have
one of those moments.
you know, people are always
talking about them.
Something that happened
in the past, so...
A moment that you wish you could
go back to and change
something you wish you could
have said or done differently.
So, would you?
Change what happened?
Wouldn't you?
It's really good
to see you, sir.
Was that your
brother's fiance?
What do you want
Miss Hathaway?
You know, you can call me
Anna, if you want.
I just want to tell you
something if you had a second.
What?
Well, I think you'll like this story
'cause it's about your brother.
I was alone in the ICU
when he woke up.
What do you mean
he woke up?
It was really beautiful
you know this one last
fight for life
before he died.
Always check the patient's
blood pressure, Mr. Cable?
Nurse Clayton!
Patient has recovered
consciousness! Vitals are dropping!
Simon did this to me.
Simon killed me.
I left it on by mistake
in my pocket.
I hate it when I do that.
Do you want some coffee?
No, that's wrong.
I would never do anything
to hurt him.
Are you sure about that?
What, what does this
even matter to you?
'Cause I think
you're lying.
I am not lying.
How would you know?
You've been so confused.
Not about that.
I would know
if I'd killed my own brother or not.
See, you're not really
sure, are you?
Why are you doing this?
Truth is anything could've
happened that night
and you wouldn't know it.
Who are you?
Who are you?
I guess I'm nobody.
Not like you.
Rich family, glamorous.
I'm just a girl who's
trying really hard
to be seen.
Bet you see me now.
You're going to
blackmail me.
You've gonna blackmail me.
I love all those pictures
of you in the magazines.
Going to parties.
Living the life.
You're fucking nuts.
Won't it be so
nice to be part of it all?
You listen to me.
I would never hurt my brother.
Do you understand?
If you want, I can go to the police.
I'm sure they'd
decide quickly.
What you would
or wouldn't do.
Would it be okay
if I called you Simon?
You know 'cause
we're going to be
seeing a lot of each other
from now on.
You're psychotic!
Wait!
You can't do this!
- I just don't give a fuck.
- Not anymore I don't.
It's just not going to happen.
Come on, man.
I just fucking screwed up.
You screwed everything up, Simon!
Mom was too easy on you.
I'm glad dad didn't live long
to see what you've turned into.
You know, I don't have to
listen to that shit anymore.
I'm sick of it!
Oh, you're sick?
How do you think I feel?
I'm sick of it!
- Get out of my house!
- Your house?
- Our house!
- It's my house!
Now, get out, Simon.
This time you lose!
You can't just
kick me out, Pete.
Where the hell
are they going?
Stay away from me!
Stay away from me!
All right, Mr. Travitt.
If you have other...
I told you someone
was trying to kill me.
I told you, but nobody
wanted to listen.
Okay, Mr. Cable.
can't you just let me...
I had no choice.
Mr Travitt.
No, it's not Travitt
it's that one.
The one who was waiting
behind the door.
The one that was
trying to kill me.
I told you to look!
I told you
to fucking look!
I'm... Just let me go.
Yes?
Help me!
Somebody!
Security to second floor.
security to second floor.
Don't do this to me!
No, don't do this to me!
- He's in that room.
- Alright.
In the stairs!
Shit, I'm still here.
My god.
Again?
You killed him.
No, this isn't real!
You understand?
This can't be real.
Do not move!
- Hey, Cable, my man, slow down.
- It's you?
Last time I checked, yeah.
You okay?
Come on.
Look, I don't want mean to
be outta line or nothing
but you're really starting
to scare me here, you know?
- You okay?
- Wait.
Hey! Cable!
Oh, shit.
Thank god!
You're alive.
Matter of opinion, wacko.
What's the problem?
You look worse than me.
Mr. Cable, will you
please leave?
He's alright, see?
He's just fine!
It was just all in my head.
Why don't you go back
down the stairs to your own room.
I need you to tell me
about my brother's death.
Peter Cable, 2 years ago.
I need to know exactly
what happened!
The soup tastes weird.
It's the same as yesterday's
mr Travitt.
In fact, it probably
is yesterday's.
You were here, I need
to know what happened.
Doctor Newman said
you should remember things
at your own pace, Mr. Cable.
But I can't!
I'm running out of time!
The soup is too goddamned salty.
Please!
Like my wife she'd oversalt
the shit out of everything.
- I need you!
- Mr. Travitt
I'm sorry the food isn't
up to your standards
but it's the best I can...
calm down! Calm down!
Calm down, calm down!
Oh, god, he's
hemorrhaging!
- What is it?
- Gurney now!
And find Newman!
You need to help me!
It's not my fault!
Give me your hands now!
Press here firmly!
Okay, mr Travitt.
Both hands!
- There's so much blood.
- I didn't mean to do it, I...
Move! Move! Both!
Nurse, get him
some oxygen!
Give me a chest setting
for spreaders!
We're going to have to
hyperventilate.
Clear airway.
For christ's sake, I just
told you it was my fault!
I killed him!
This has nothing
to do with you.
I killed him!
Jesus.
Let go of my arm
Mr. Cable.
Okay, please tell me about
Peter cable, two years ago.
Can you page
Dr. Seymour for me, please?
What happened to
my brother?
He was brought in
by the paramedics.
I think there were
Human M.V.A:s arrived
We got two.
There's one en route.
Your brother's injuries
were so severe
Mr Cable, that after surgery
he was hooked up to
life support on the I.C.U.
where he died.
Yeah, I'm sorry.
Was nurse Hathaway
in the I.C.U. that night?
Why don't you ask her
yourself?
You know I know
she was here.
- Claire, hospital.
- What do you want?
Just wanna make sure that
you're playing by the
rules of the game
I gave into you.
You remember.
What a surprise.
You're completely out of
your fucking mind.
You realize that?
See, there's
the old Simon I know.
You coming home, honey?
- Not to you.
- Want to bet?
You're bleeding.
I don't know
what happened.
You hit your head
in my memory.
And now you're bleeding.
I killed Travitt
and now he's dying.
Anyway, now that you've made
your breathtaking recovery.
Are we clear on the terms
of our arrangement?
- It's over.
- I will decide when it's over.
No, you won't.
The thing is, Anna.
None of this is
gonna to happen.
The thing is, Simon.
It happened.
And I'm going to
change it.
Everything's going to
be different!
You can't change anything.
This isn't going to
end like this!
I won't let it!
Take me back!
One, two, three, four!
Shit.
That was stupid.
Simon?
I love you, Claire.
Finally, he says it.
I love you too, Simon.
I wish I didn't, but I do.
I think this is my favorite
room in the whole house.
All these things growing.
I could live in here.
Back in a minute.
Simon, what we just said
to each other.
Serious, I mean.
It's really serious.
We do have a choice.
What are you saying?
I'm saying.
As much as I love you
Claire,
He's my brother.
I just can't do this
to him.
But you can do it to me?
I have to...
Peter.
Peter, wait!
Peter, please.
Can we talk about this?
I don't want to talk,
Claire.
I don't even want to
look at you!
Peter, I...
Claire! Get the fuck out!
Oh shit.
Wait! Claire!
Claire, wait!
We really need
to talk, Pete.
I don't think I have anything
left to say to you, Simon.
Peter, please.
she was my fiance
Simon!
Nothing happened
between us.
You have to believe me.
She, she loves you.
She's in love with you.
- You don't know that.
- Simon, I want you out of the house.
Pete, I didn't mean for
any of this to happen.
You make me sick.
You are not ending up
with her.
Peter, don't go up there.
I made a mistake!
Your whole life's a mistake, Simon!
Mom was too easy on you
I'm glad dad didn't live
long enough to see what you've...
Why is it always
have to be about this?
This is what its about.
I'm sick of it!
- Now, get out of my house!
- It's our house!
- It's our...
- It's over, get out Simon.
This time you lose!
Wait! Don't!
Don't go out!
Don't go out there!
Peter!
Peter.
Jesus!
Hang on, man.
Peter, just keep
breathing.
You okay?
I'm going to change, man.
I promise, I'll be different.
I'm gonna get you
to the hospital.
You're gonna make it, man.
You're going to be
alright, Pete.
I'm going to get you
to the hospital.
Come on! Just go!
You're going to be
alright, Pete.
There won't be an accident.
Back that truck up, now!
Caucasian male.
Lacerations to the head and neck.
Possibly thirty years old.
Get these cars out of here.
Are you alright?
You okay?
Take it easy now man.
I'm gonna to take you on a little trip.
Peter?
Simon?
Back here.
A fire in summer?
I wanted a fire.
I figured why not
learning to live
a little.
It's really good
to see you, sir.
It's good to see you, too.
Come here.
- Are you okay?
- I don't know.
No one says
you have to know.
Anyway.
I know you like bread.
Great.
I was thinking how much
I've missed seeing you,
like when we were kids.
Oh, god, we used to be up
in that attic for hours.
Yeah.
You know Pete, I don't even
remember why we stopped talking.
Doesn't matter now.
You're here.
We're talking.
That's all I wanted.
I'm not sure I can remember
what happened, Peter.
Your memory again?
I just I need to know
what happened.
Why do you want to go
over this again?
You fell through
the skylight?
Is that what happened?
I think you know
exactly what happened.
It's just too tough
for you to face it.
Which I can understand
Well, but what about
Claire?
She was coming back
for you, Simon.
You were driving us
from the house,
from the cliffs.
There's only one road.
There was no way
you could have seen.
Seen what, Peter?
I can't help but think that
we're paying for what happened.
It wasn't supposed
to happen like this.
Doesn't matter now.
There's only one inescapable
rule in the game of life, kid.
Sooner or later
everybody has to stop playing.
No, wait a minute.
There's something wrong, Peter!
There's something wrong!
I was going to change
everything.
This is your choice, Simon.
I thought I could
change it.
You need to leave
this behind you, Simon.
For Claire.
For me.
For dad.
You died, Simon.
We all did.
And you can't move on from all
of this until you let go.
Let it go.
I need another chance.
I know I could do better.
Simon, how many more chances
do you think you should get?
Are you alright?
You okay?
Take it easy man.
I'm going to take you
on a little trip.
Dr. Truman, M.V.A.s arrived.
- What have we got?
- We got two, there's one en route.
This is Mr. Simon Cable.

He's crashed!
Get the defrib!

It's your choice, Simon.
Where you go.
It's your choice.
Time of death
Easy.
Diazepam, five milligrams.
Easy now, Mr. Cable.
You're going to be fine.
You were just having
a nightmare.
You're in a hospital
Saint Jude's.
I'm doctor Jeremy Newman.
I'm assigned your case.
You were admitted last night.
You don't remember?
This is the 29th of July.
The year is 2002,
and your wife,
whose name is Anna,
is waiting outside.
You died, Mr. Cable.
