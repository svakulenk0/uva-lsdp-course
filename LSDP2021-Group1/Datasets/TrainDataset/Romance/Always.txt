Hey, Bud! Get up!
Pete, can't get through.
That's funny.
It seems pretty clear over here.
Tanker Base.
Tanker Base,
this is Fire Boss. Over.
WOMAN: Go ahead, Boss.
FIRE BOSS: We've got
a situation here.
Sector K, that's for,
"Kwick, we're kooking."
WOMAN: Cavalry coming up
inside four minutes.
Tanker 57 to Fire Boss.
Make that one minute.
Peter St. Peter,
don't do this to me. How much fuel you got left?
I love it
in the kitchen, baby. You know that.
Peter St. Peter,
you've got that Evel Knievel sound in your voice I hate.
I want to blow
out this one tree, funny face...
...and make a wish
for your birthday.
You want to keep flying,
land that plane.
Do what the lady says.
In the trees...
Obscuring...
Excuse me, I didn't
quite catch that.
Take over, Frank.
Yeah.
Tanker 57 to Tanker Base.
I've got a small
inconvenience here.
Talk to me, Pete.
I may have
overestimated my fuel just a tad.
I see the base and my
right engine is fine, so there shouldn't be any...
...problem.
What do you need?
What do you need?
Glider practice.
FRANK:
We've got a situation.
Flier coming in, dead stick.
This is good.
I was rusty on panic.
No problem. I've got
the airport in sight.
A nice little headwind.
Up and over.
Come on, Mama.
Up and over. Up and over.
Please, please.
Come on, Mama,
we're too cute to die.
Up!
There he is!
Okay.
Happy birthday.
I'm taking a plane.
Why?
This time
he's really done it.
Done what?
Oh, Christ.
Happy birthday to you...
Take off!
You don't even
understand how I feel!
This time I'm
going to show him.
Excuse me, Willy.
You magnificent pagan god!
PETE: Thanks, Al.
What gives?
She's showing you.
She's a great girl.
She's great.
Showing me what?
I didn't know it
was her birthday.
It's because you don't
love her like I do.
Where did you get
that oil on your face? Where?
It's here. Look.
It's terrible.
Thanks.
What do you mean,
"showing me"?
I don't like her
flying that. Now you're getting it.
You're mad at me.
I can tell.
It's okay. I'm just moody.
Beautiful day.
Yes, it is.
How was my landing?
Nearly perfect.
Wow! Thanks.
You only fly like that
when I'm watching.
I always come in
on three wheels.
Perverse, aren't you?
Don't do that, Dorinda.
Can she take
the Wiley scrapper? The Wiley vet?
Who knows?
There's a quick left. Look out.
Level off
when you come in.
Don't tell me what to do.
What did I say?
You got something
in your teeth.
I ain't
falling for that.
You caught some
heat coming in.
You know women.
I mean your plane.
I might have to kill
you for that remark.
Every time you come in,
the fire trucks come out.
Nails, go play golf.
It's my plane.
You've got something
between your teeth.
What makes you think
I forgot your birthday?
Why do you do this?
Want to dance?
There's a dance tonight.
Coming through.
Please, take mine.
This is for you.
You're incredible.
You think you
can buy me off
with some crummy present
you got in an airport gift shop.
It's worked before.
I don't want it.
Take it.
Fathead.
"Fathead"?
Yeah.
I don't want it.
Yes, you do.
I don't.
You do.
You do. You really do.
You really don't?
No.
Oh, Pete.
Girl clothes!
Get back!
Don't touch that!
Why didn't you tell me
before I lost my temper?
So you do like dresses.
It's not the dress.
It's the way you see me.
Know what this
place reminds me of?
I'll bet you a beer
you're going to tell me.
You lose.
Love! It ain't
what it used to be.
There have only
ever been two kinds.
Flash fires,
which are all flame,
burn themselves out
and leave nothing.
Then there is
the long burning. That is nature's burn.
Even when you
think it's out...
...the forest floor
is warm to the touch.
That's what you
and Dorinda have got.
You're a poet, Al.
You're a really bad poet,
but you're a poet.
To hell with it.
This place reminds me of World War II.
This is deep.
I wasn't in it,
but think about it.
The beer is warm,
the hall is a Quonset...
...there are B-26s outside,
hotshot pilots inside. Airstrip in the woods.
It's England!
Everything but Glenn Miller.
Except we bomb places
that are already burning.
You see, Pete,
there ain't no war here.
What's taking her so long?
That's why they don't
make movies called,
Night Raid to Boise,
Idaho or...
...Firemen Strike at Dawn.
And this is why you're
not exactly a hero
for taking
the chances you take.
You're more of
what I would call a dickhead.
Is this heading somewhere?
Here's my point.
I'm talking to this guy.
He tells me about
this tanker school in Flat Rock, Colorado.
A school for fire pilots.
There are no forest fires
in Flat Rock, Colorado,
because there are no trees.
That is why they
call it Flat Rock, you dunce.
I think they
know this, Pete.
That's why they
chose Flat Rock.
So they could start
a few little fires
without burning
down all of Colorado.
The idea...
...is to teach
guys to do drops
and set up test areas
to teach pilots
who want to get their
Initial Attack cards.
Are you following this?
Yeah. Yeah.
They're looking for
a great teacher,
like a commanding officer.
An experienced guy
who might be looking for a change of pace.
Year-round employment,
great paycheck. Are you with me?
I'm way ahead of you.
It's not a bad notion.
I'm glad you
see it like this.
It's a terrific idea.
You'd be perfect for it.
Me? I'm not
talking about me.
I don't need a day job.
I'm very happy...
Gosh.
Beer, please.
In a champagne glass.
Make it two.
Let me make
something clear.
If you think
you can make me
weak in the knees by
giving me girl clothes,
you're as out-of-date
as your airplane. You know?
I know.
I'm not weak in the knees.
I'm weak in the head.
You're beautiful.
I love you.
I know.
So tell me you love me.
Please, please.
Tell me, tell me.
Tell me, tell me!
In front of all
these people?
You mean Carl?
Le Budweiser.
The '89.
BOTH: Thanks, Carl.
To us.
Always.
Hmm.
St. Louis. Southside.
You never laugh
at my jokes.
What jokes?
Left rudder. Left.
I know, I know.
It's too bad we
don't have a song.
You know, when couples
say, "Honey, they're playing our song."
I can't believe you forgot.
What, we have a song?
Yes, we have a song.
You big lug!
You'll break my heart.
You're calling me
a "big lug"?
Let's try that signaling
to the band bit.
It works in the movies.
Guys, hit it.
They
Asked me how I knew
My true love was true
I of course replied
Something here inside
Cannot be denied
You laugh like a donkey.
I do not.
Do, too.
I don't do that.
Do you know him?
Never saw him before.
You smiled at
a poor defenseless guy.
Yes, I think I did.
That was
a damn-fool thing to do.
Why, darling?
You are giving
smiles away now?
I'm feeling very fine.
Are you sure you're
not feeling feverish?
I'm all right as long
as we keep dancing.
Happy birthday.
It's not my birthday.
It isn't?
No.
I forgot your
birthday again?
No, you just
remembered it wrong.
My turn, flyboy.
Hi, Donnie.
You look like an angel.
Let's go start
ourselves a little fire.
Airborne, cutting in.
Stand in the door.
Whoa! Time out now.
Nobody dances with this dress
until they wash their hands.
Miss Scarlett?
Oh, boys.
You want to dance
with my girl, you've got to wipe your hands.
That's it. Whoa!
That's not a towel.
That's good. Very good.
You missed a spot.
Oh, God!
Is that your plane?
Yes, that is mine.
Come on. A shortcut.
Pete?
Hmm?
Haircut.
What?
You want me to get
a haircut today?
Cat food.
Green apples.
You're shopping in
your sleep again.
Chicken wings.
Tempura batter.
What is for dinner?
Toilet paper. Soap.
And dessert?
Kitty litter.
Q-tips.
Socks.
Pete?
What?
You have a bad dream?
It's cold.
Come on.
I'm watching the fire.
We don't do fires
at night.
We do fires in the day.
At night, we eat, drink
and be mad for each other.
Mmm. Sounds like
an all right life.
I like it.
I thought I might try it.
Try what?
Tankers.
I'd like to get
type-rated for air tankers.
Then we'd both be up
there instead of
one of us on the ground
and the other...
Forget it.
I could make it in a year.
With three years
of hauling freight, I've done 1,000 hours.
I saw the last
four minutes. Forget it.
It's none of your beeswax.
It is my beeswax and
I won't let you do it.
How will you stop me?
By telling you "no."
By asking you nicely.
Dorinda, honey, please.
Don't be
a pigheaded fool.
That is irresistible.
Now you listen to
me for a change.
I'll make you a deal.
Here's your chance to
get me out of the air.
I'll ground myself
in Flat Rock and be your girl.
Have you been
talking to Al?
Or...
...I head off on my own
and tonight is goodbye.
I'll find my own piece of sky
and a guy who flies sensible.
I fly sensible.
Not when something
is on fire.
That is the deal.
Then it is no deal.
Let's change the subject.
What's going on?
Why are you doing this?
Because...
Because why? Why?
Because...
Why are you doing this?
Because I love you.
Fighting fires is what
I do and it is what I love, and you know that!
What the hell is going on
that you want me to quit?
You want me to move
to Colorado and
teach pretend fires
to trainees like I'm going to an office?
Pete.
Your number is up.
When my number is up...
...it is up.
Right?
I could just as soon
buy it ferrying Bibles to Salt Lake City.
When it is your turn,
I don't want to be around.
I think that is
very selfish of you.
You should be
at the funeral,
crying and looking
terrific before you enter the nunnery.
You wish!
I'll have better things
to do and better men to do them with.
Forget about these
other men, Dorinda.
You'll never be
with another man.
I will, too,
and he'll be tall.
No, Dorinda.
Why not?
You'll never get over me.
Don't kid yourself.
No one will ever
be as much fun.
Fun?
You think I have fun
when you have fun?
When you fly into
some narrow canyon,
you think I'm
on the ground going, "Boy, this is fun"?
I could understand
how you fly
if you were
risking yourself for civilization.
If you were...
...putting your life on
the line for another life,
anybody's life.
I love you, Pete.
But I'm not enjoying it.
Every time
you take off,
I wait for
the phone to ring.
I go to bed sick
and I get up scared.
I don't like being
sick inside all the time.
Do think I like being afraid
that you won't come back?
Okay. Okay.
Look...
...I have an idea.
Bear with me a second.
Okay.
Keep an open mind,
because it is a pretty radical idea.
Al told me about
a training school in Flat Rock, Colorado.
They need
a commanding officer and I was wondering,
why don't I take you
to Colorado and you could be my girl
and I could teach those
geeks to fight fires.
You know, till they could
put out a cigar at 200 feet
and I'd come
home every night
and we'd have an apartment
with a microwave oven.
Don't answer it.
I won't.
It's not my phone.
Hi, Al.
No.
No, because
it is my day off.
Get yourself another pilot.
I'm hanging up my spurs.
That's right.
Yes, she's a great
girl, isn't she?
Okay.
Al is on his way over.
It's your lay-off day.
There is a new burn
in the south rim.
There are already two
pilots down.
Down?
Sick.
What you got?
We've got nine hot spots.
We're only taking care of three of them.
I love you!
You can't leave
without knowing that.
I know you do
and you know I do.
How would I know that?
You never say the words!
These days we've had,
last night. These things are fragile!
What? We got
a lot of things settled last night.
Shut up!
Kiss me and fly!
Dorinda, I love you!
I love...
I love you!
Al the Pal, this is Pete
St. Pete. Over.
This is Al the Pal.
I've got you loud and proud.
This is Fire Boss, over.
AL: This is Al the Pal.
Roger, Al.
Go for the leading edge of the fire.
You got it.
PETE: Two minutes
behind him, Boss.
Good enough, good buddy.
Get down!
Save some fire for me.
There is plenty of
fire for everybody.
Watch his next pass
and build on that.
Oh! Bad strike!
Al, pull up.
Goddamn it, I thought
that was it, man!
Oh, shit.
Al! What happened?
PETE: Talk to me.
My engine is on fire!
Can you believe that?
And I was in
such a good mood.
You think you
can make it back?
It ain't happening!
The fire will hit
the fuel tank any second! Damn!
Use your extinguisher.
Already did.
I'm screwed.
Pete, lighten up
or you won't pull out of that dive!
Pete, this ain't
a dogfight, man!
BOSS: Pete, this is the boss!
That dive is way too steep!
Pull out of there!
You're too heavy!
Get out of there!
Now!
Baby, you're the greatest!
Come on.
Get up!
Come on, Pete, pull up.
Come on, man.
Get up!
Oh, yes! He made it!
That lucky son of a bitch.
Hello, Pete.
Hello.
Hap.
Hello, Hap.
That was quite
a show back there.
Yes, ma'am.
Take a seat.
Okay. Thanks.
I sure saved Al's bacon,
all right.
Too bad about my port engine.
My fuel tank went up like...
Just a minute.
Comfy around the neck?
Yeah. Yeah, it's fine.
Listen, how did I
get out of that one?
You didn't.
I didn't?
Mmm-mmm.
My plane blew up.
I remember that.
A real fireball.
Now I'm sitting
in the woods, getting my hair cut.
Either I'm dead
or I'm crazy.
You're not crazy, Pete.
Hap.
Don't think
I'm doubting
your good faith.
I just want to get
something clear.
Okay?
Okay.
Okay.
I'm dead?
That's right.
I'm dead?
Right.
Keep the sideburns.
What a jerk
I turned out to be.
Dead.
What do you think of that?
Dorinda.
She's still not over it.
I hope not. I've only
been dead 20 minutes.
Yes and no.
Down there they think it's six months.
Time is funny stuff.
A lot funnier than
Einstein ever figured out.
Yeah?
How did he take it?
That'll do it.
Where was I?
"Time is funny stuff."
Yes. That was it.
Space has its points, too.
So in the five months since you crashed...
You said it was
six months.
That was then.
I'm explaining this to you in the wrong order.
Hey, look!
PETE: I did my first
solo in one of those!
HAP: That's right.
I did that!
That's right.
Boy, was I nervous!
But you want to know a funny thing?
Once I got up there,
I felt like a veteran.
I couldn't do
anything wrong.
I flew that plane
like Fats Waller flies his piano.
I circled the field,
then I found
a perfect sideslip
in the wind
and I came in
just like a leaf.
That's right.
You think you did
that by yourself?
There was nobody else
up there with me.
There was, Pete.
There was?
There was someone like you.
Behind him was someone else.
Maybe someone who learned
what he learned on a motorized box kite.
And you knew that,
though you had a different word for it.
I did? What word?
It's what fliers
and piano players
and everyone else count on.
They reach for it. They pray for it.
And often, just when
they need it most, they get it.
It's breathed into them.
It's what the word means.
Spiritus.
The divine breath.
Inspiration.
Inspiration.
And now it's your
turn to give it back.
That's how
the whole thing works.
That's how the
whole thing works.
So now I'm supposed
to give inspiration to some flyer?
Yes, but you're
not going back as a flying instructor.
That's only part of it.
How does this
work if I'm...
They hear you inside
their own minds,
as if it were their
thoughts. Clever?
Clever.
But remember, Pete.
You've had your life,
for better or for worse.
Anything you do
for yourself now is a waste of spirit.
There's your boy.
Hi.
Hey, Rachel.
Hi, buddy.
Why are you so happy?
I think you're a pretty
silly-looking guy. What do you think of that?
It has a mind of its own.
A glitch in the transmission.
Are you Baker?
Yeah.
The boss wants
to see you.
Thanks. Where?
To the right of
where it says, "Women."
Green door.
Thanks.
I'm the "Women."
First thing you have
to know is what type of plane you're flying.
That determines
how many drops you can make.
In our example,
we have an eight-door aircraft...
Looking for
the training school? Yes.
See the base
commander next door.
Al, you son
of a bitch, you!
Jeez, you look great!
I mean, you look
terrible in the same old great way.
Honor to meet you,
sir. Ted Baker.
Sorry I'm late.
Did you get lost?
Yes, I did.
How did you know?
It says here you
got your ticket back
after a 12-month
suspension.
While they looked
into why you flew 500 kitchen units...
There's a crawly
thing on your face.
Don't you want to
scratch your cheek? Its legs are tickling you.
You mixed up Burbank
with Van Nuys.
Lymers.
It's a little Lyme tick.
My directional
gyro wasn't working.
They're burrowing in.
They're laying eggs.
You also violated
military air space.
Try this.
It'll feel good.
There you go.
I'm going to
like this job.
Sir, you have
a smudge on your face.
Here?
The other side.
Right there.
Another comedian.
I'm not a comedian.
You better not be.
I feel so alive!
Let me light that
for you.
It's okay.
Probably a cross wind
over the trash can.
Kid, I think
we're both making a big mistake.
Why don't you try again
with Wing 'N' Prayer?
That was an air
delivery service. I was ahead of my time.
You're that guy!
That's why I'm here.
I've never seen an
operation like this before. I like the smell of it.
The smoke?
That, too.
I knew that was
what I wanted to do.
I don't know.
Give him a chance!
Okay, you've got a chance.
Don't screw it up.
Thank you, sir.
Look at that bum.
He thinks he is on vacation.
AL: Go.
Go.
Tune it. Tune it.
Beautiful.
C-119 Transport,
this is Al the Pal.
Let the games begin.
Right on.
Looking good.
Pitiful.
It's a little premature.
Bring it in, Powerhouse.
That's it. Beautiful.
Bring that fat
bomber in here.
Drop! Drop!
I'm glad we're not at war.
Ted Baker, show time.
Hit it.
Bad line, Ted.
Bad line!
If you don't
straighten out, you'll dump all over Al.
Great line, Ted.
Aim for the flag that
looks like an umbrella.
I'm sorry, Hap,
I can't help it. What the hell?
Oh, my God!
Nuts.
Whoa!
You'll find
your fortune falling
All over town
Is this first place?
You must have showers
Cute.
Now we know
how ready you are.
Fire season will
be here soon.
If we get a real big one,
they'll be calling guys
from all over. They'll be...
...calling veterans,
first-timers,
guys from all
over the country.
When they call me and
say, "What've you got?"
I'll tell them
I've got nothing
because you're nothing.
What you did today was nothing.
You can't hit
a smoking oil drum and a drum ain't a tree!
A tree can explode
like a bomb!
It can go up
like a Roman candle.
An oil drum has no heat.
In a real fire, there is heat.
There's heat that
can suck you under, flip you over.
There are currents
that tie knots in a windsock. And, Baker...
You're on the bus.
When I get back from
San Diego tomorrow, I want you gone.
Come on, Al.
I didn't say anything.
Good.
It wasn't his fault.
Tell him it wasn't your fault.
Where are you going?
Where are you going?
Don't quit.
I didn't come back to inspire a quitter.
He'll cool off once
his color is normal.
Party's over for me.
Forget that. This is your farewell party.
Saddle up.
We're going to hit the bright lights.
I think she likes you.
Oh, Ted.
I met the most important
girl of my life in a bar like this.
It's true.
I took one look
at her and I said, "This is it."
I went up to her and
I looked in her eyes,
and I said,
"You are the reason
that I am here."
What'll it be?
Vodka martini.
Don't forget the olive.
Root beer.
Don't forget the olive.
Hello, Ted.
We'll miss you.
"You're the reason
I'm here."
Can I buy you a drink?
Sure.
Bartender.
Diet Pepsi.
With or without
the olive?
With or without...
I think without.
Thank you.
Dance with her.
She wants to dance with you.
Don't you have
any impulses?
Dance?
Sure, I'd love to.
Love to what?
Did you say "dance"?
Did I? I can't dance.
Talking is nice.
I'm not a good
talker either.
This is nice.
It is?
Don't you think so?
Rachel?
Do you think
it's possible to see a girl
and know right off
that she is it?
I think it's possible.
This is hard
to talk about.
Try.
It's happened to me.
I think you're
overdoing this.
It has?
It was last summer.
I only saw her once.
I wish you could have met her.
It's like reading a book,
and after the first page,
you know how
it will turn out. It was like that.
That's why I'm here.
It feels good to
tell somebody that. Thank you.
Well, I think I'll just...
...come in again.
Rachel, what
about your drink? He's bringing your drink.
I don't think I've
ever come across
this particular
technique before.
First approach,
this is Cessna Skymaster 5-2-1-0 Kilo.
Roger, 1-0 Kilo.
DORINDA: Squawk 0-2-4-7,
maintain 5,500.
Say again.
Dorinda?
Honey bunny?
You little quarter-pounder,
is that you?
Lamb chop, what are
you doing here?
Coast approach, baby.
Request immediate
rendezvous upon landing.
Welcome.
I'm Julia Child.
Today we're going to make
a holiday feast or
le fete d'holiday.
We're going to start
with half-boned chicken or poularde,
demi des Francais.
To bone the chicken,
you need
a very sharp knife.
You can't do nothing
without a very sharp knife.
Now I've done it.
I cut the dickens out of my finger.
I'm glad in a way
this happened.
Accidents do occur
from time to time in the kitchen.
Have you been
here long, kid?
Huh?
Been here long?
Not so long.
I've been doing standby
at the tower for about a month.
It's just holiday relief.
Can I use your phone?
Yes.
Frank, this is Al Yackey.
I'm the guy that was
over this morning
looking for
the Skymaster that
was being retired.
You said I could
check it out as soon as
I found a pilot to
fly it to Flat Rock.
I found a guy.
I'll be over in an hour to take it off your hands.
I'll bring
the guy with me.
What are you doing?
I'm taking you back
to Flat Rock with me.
I can't go.
Why?
Because...
...I'm here now.
Stop it, okay?
You don't play dumb
with me and I won't play dumb with you.
I miss him, too!
I miss him, too.
I miss him every day.
I loved him like I
never loved a guy and I don't love guys.
You don't have
an excuse. You quit!
You quit. You gave up.
He never quit anything
until it killed him.
That was his way.
There are worse ways and you sure found one.
I can't
live without him.
Bullshit!
Bullshit.
That's Al coming
in from San Diego.
We'll talk to him.
He's a good guy.
He always sees
the funny side. Want to cut your engine?
Reminds me of
a girl I knew.
How are you doing, Linda?
You'd better land
and sit this one out.
And make it fast.
MAN:
Walk! Don't walk!
No swimming! No entry!
It's a fact.
I saw the signs. A-ha!
I saw all the signs.
Exit!
Falling rocks!
Jesus saves! Save water! Turn off the lights! Click.
Hi.
Danger!
Keep off the grass!
I saw the signs.
No shoes, no shirt, no service.
Yield. Tow away.
Use other door.
That's no way
to live.
No wonder I'm not
giving lessons in love.
Lessons in love.
I can turn a plane
on a wingtip.
I can stall a plane
at 1,000 feet and come up smiling.
Come up smiling.
But that don't
matter a damn.
Matter a damn.
You can hear me.
You can hear me.
I can hear you fine.
Hey, old-timer.
Just passing through?
Ted, listen to me.
How did you
know my name?
Maybe crazy old hobos
are like radio stations,
picking up voices
from people who've gone off the air.
So tune in, kid.
I want to get this through to you.
Get through to you.
With me,
it was Dorinda.
Dorinda.
When you meet
the woman you love...
The woman you love.
Not Dorinda,
the one he loves.
Dorinda,
the one you love.
After you're dead
you can never
go back for her.
Go back for her.
You can't turn around
and do it right.
Turn around.
Do it right!
That's not what I mean.
What I'm trying to say is,
I've seen the signs.
No exit. No passing.
No parking.
No U-turn.
I'm going back to get
my Air Attack card.
Tower, find Al Yackey
and tell him Ted Baker wants to talk.
I like you this way, Ted.
You're revved up and full of moxie.
I hate you!
Charlie! Somebody!
In this world,
you have to go out
and get what you want.
Follow me?
Rachel, slow down.
Where is she taking us?
Ted!
Don't "Follow Me"!
Ted.
I think we're being
a little gullible.
It's empty.
That's my boy.
I know him.
That's my boy.
Should I call the base?
We'll need
a forklift again.
You all right?
I'm okay.
Al Yackey, please.
Yes, it's me.
No, I'm fine.
You should come
down here and see
how your boys
redecorated my porch.
It's your deal.
I'm just renting.
Okay, I'll see you.
Hello, Dorinda.
I'm right here.
I'm sitting here...
...right beside you.
I know you can't see me,
but
I can see you.
I can see your hair.
It's almost in your...
That's my girl.
You're still my girl,
aren't you?
I thought so.
God, I wish
we'd met sooner.
I wish we'd met
when we were five.
I'd have swept
you right off your three-wheeler.
You've still got
a funny face.
I can't believe
how much I miss you.
I miss you
like it was
a thousand years.
I remember everything.
I remember things I'd forgotten.
Like...
...from the first
second I met you,
when you were
sitting alone in that restaurant
and I looked
at you and I said, "That's her."
"That's the one."
Do you remember?
I walked up
to you and I said...
You're the reason
I'm here.
Ted Baker.
Wing 'N' Prayer.
I don't know your name,
but we met...
Danced.
Uh...
We did?
Well, not exactly.
You were dancing
with everybody
and I tried to
dance with you, but... Yeah.
Happy days.
You're here again!
Are you all right?
I'll have the fence fixed, I swear.
You never told me
life was so exciting.
I can explain everything.
No, I can't.
People always
dropping in.
Why are you still here?
I told you to leave.
He likes you.
He doesn't like anybody.
Is this your cat?
Yes.
What's his name?
Linda Blair.
You laugh
like a donkey.
I like it. I...
...used to know
a donkey.
Why are you still here?
Al, do you remember
Ted Baker? Ted, this is Al Yackey.
How have you been?
I'm stupid. You guys...
You must be one
of Al's pilots.
I was.
That's a nice surprise.
Isn't it?
Yes, isn't it?
Indeed it is.
Yes, Baker is one
of the boys.
I am?
Yes.
The lad shows
a lot of promise. I do?
Dorinda is one of the
toughest fire-fighting babes you'll ever see.
And funny.
She told a joke in
mess the other day.
Milk squirted out half
the nostrils on base.
One old guy laughed so hard
he passed a kidney stone...
Yes, you did,
you scalawag. Don't deny it.
She killed me.
I spotted.
Anyway...
Ted Baker, what
should I call you? Baker, Ted, Teddy?
Let's get back to the base.
We've got some catching up to do.
You can show Dorinda
the ropes later.
DORINDA: What ropes?
See you again,
Miss Durston.
Miss Durston.
He's so well reared.
You'll say anything,
won't you?
Don't forget,
you're still my girl.
Relax.
This is supposed
to be fun.
You look like you're
hanging in a closet.
Drop your shoulders.
Drop them.
I need you to go to
town for supplies.
You'll need help
lifting the supplies, so I'll send a guy with you.
Uh, let's see.
Baker. Yes, Baker.
He's too beautiful.
He's too much twisted steel and sex appeal.
I can't be with a guy
who looks like I won him in a raffle.
A couple of drinks,
a couple of laughs...
Hey...
You'll have
time for the short, ugly guys later.
Hold your course.
I gotta relax.
You know what
I do to relax?
I sing. I hum.
I whistle.
Relax your shoulders.
Both of them.
This is fun. Relax.
I have to relax.
This was a great idea.
It's not my idea.
I know, but it's
still great.
On my great idea scale,
I give it an eight.
An eight? Not a ten?
No.
No, ten is for
stuff like
penicillin and
democracy.
But going to the store
to get you supplies is an eight, tops.
Maybe even a
seven and a half.
This is getting
worse by the minute.
It wasn't my idea.
I know that.
"I'll tell ya, little missy, you're
"mighty pretty
when you're angry." Uh-huh.
Oh, so you
do impressions?
Just that one.
Uh-huh.
Who was it?
BOTH: Who was it?
James Stewart?
You think it was
Henry Fonda?
"Well, I'll tell ya,
little missy, you're
"mighty pretty
when you're angry." Wa-ha.
Henry Fonda.
John Wayne!
Don't you know who he is?
That was John Wayne?
Do it again.
No.
Oh, come on.
Come on.
If I know who it is,
I'll recognize it.
But Henry Fonda?
"Well, I'll tell ya something, missy...
"...you sure
do look pretty when you're angry."
Wa-ha.
Wa-ha.
Wa-ha.
Wa-ha.
Wa-ha.
I'll sing to you.
I'll sing to you,
you college boy.
I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy
She crossed the Missouri
with her lover, Ike
TED: Whoa.
DORINDA: Is he drunk?
TED: I don't know.
DORINDA: Whoa.
Too close.
Hey, mister.
Go call the
paramedics. Hurry.
WOMAN: What happened?
Call an ambulance!
Well, Frank is sick
and I'll try to help him.
Tell me your names.
Who's first?
Mario.
Todd.
Ascensión.
All right,
what do you want to be when you grow up?
I want to work
on Wall Street.
Wall Street?
I never had good enough grades to work on Wall Street.
What about you, Mario?
MARIO: I want
to be an astronaut.
GIRL: I want
to be a veterinarian.
BOY: I want to be
a football player.
You did real good,
stopping that bus before you died.
Come on, kid.
You can do it.
I have to go
to the bathroom.
I have to go
to the bathroom, too. Come on, Frank.
Hey, you made it!
Hi.
Hi.
Come in.
Thanks.
Holy cow,
look at this.
Yeah.
You've been busy.
Kind of.
I had no idea.
Everything smells great.
Look what you've done.
She can't do toast.
You've got a little
mashed potatoes right...
Oh.
Oh, look at me.
Uh, let me go get
myself fixed up.
There's something
fishy here and it's not the chicken.
Then there was the time
he delivered a PBY to
to Michigan or Mexico.
Know what a PBY is?
Ketchup?
Sure.
He's taking off
in this PBY,
which is a feat in itself.
They're amazing planes.
TED: It's like
a tugboat with wings.
Do they only feed
you every two weeks?
What was I
talking about?
Pete, still.
So he's flying this PBY
when he sees this fire.
Forest fire.
Uh-uh.
Main Street.
Village grocery store.
The nearest fire engine
is 20 miles away.
Oh, you can
pick up the chicken.
Anything that flies,
it's okay.
Even in a
good restaurant.
Mmm-hmm.
He sees this building on fire
and outside of town is this reservoir.
So he...
Fills the plane with water
and dumps it on the fire.
No, he missed!
He hit the post office next door.
Took him three tries.
The town was awash.
The groceries were burned.
It was fire,
flood and famine. If he'd managed
the plague, it would've
been the Four Horsemen
of the Apocalypse
in one PBY.
I mean, he was unique.
Why are you
plucking your eyebrows?
Oh, I didn't know I was.
Nervous habit.
Want to do the wishbone?
Sure.
Okay, here we go.
Your wish.
He was up in that plane,
doing his dumb stunts.
There would be this
tone in his voice.
I called it his
"Evel Knievel" voice.
I don't know who he was
when he sounded like that.
Part of you thought
it was great.
DORINDA: What did
he think I thought?
Was he dumb
enough to think
I admired him for it?
For flying like that?
Okay.
Do you think?
I wasn't there.
I shouldn't be
talking about this.
Some birthday.
It's your birthday?
No, it's yours.
No, it isn't.
Since it was your birthday
this time last year,
it should be
this year, too. No, no.
Pete remembered
my birthday wrong.
It's a year tomorrow.
TED:
It's a year tomorrow.
A year?
I saw him land
a plane once. I saw him dance.
He had his own
way of doing both.
He could drive an A-26
around the sky.
He wasn't dumb.
You were impressed that
he brought that A-26 in on an empty tank.
You try it.
When I do,
I'll have the height.
I'd like to be there.
I want you
to be there.
What are you doing to me?
Trying to
confuse you, I hope.
You are.
You never thought
you'd dance again, did you?
I guess.
Shh! Hear that?
What?
There's no music.
That's my girl, pal.
Yes, put that one on.
Fast forward.
Keep going.
Keep going.
Keep going.
No, don't stop.
Left rudder.
TED: I think
you got me all wrong.
You invited me
because I'm a safe guy
who will play along with
your memories of Pete.
I don't have any
memories of Pete.
I have memories
of my own,
but I don't let them get
in the way of my life.
Oh, Hap!
Please! Please,
take me out of here.
Can we...
...just finish this dance
some other time?
I'm sorry.
Sleep tight, baby sister.
See you tomorrow.
I'll see you tomorrow.
I'm going to see
if old Dollar's tied
to the hitching rail
and ride off
into the sunset by myself again.
Can I
have this dance?
Lettuce.
Ketchup.
Peaches.
Cantaloupe.
Eggs.
PETE: You're shopping
in your sleep again.
DORINDA:
Peanut butter.
Gin.
Anything special for me?
Chlorine bleach.
Chap Stick.
Band-Aids.
You always made me laugh.
Uh-uh.
Yes, you did.
You never laughed.
I never laughed
at your jokes,
but you were
always very funny.
Liar, liar,
pants on fire.
I swear to God
I'll keep you safe.
I'll never
leave you again.
Yes.
Good night, Dorinda.
Night, Pete.
Hap. How did
you get here?
I mean, how did I get here?
Mainly by the wrong road.
I told you,
your life is over
and anything you
do for yourself
is a waste of spirit,
remember?
Yes, I remember.
But you didn't tell me
everything, did you?
Do you know what
I've been going through?
Yes.
What do you want
from me, Hap?
If I'm really dead,
how come I hurt so bad?
What kind of deal is this?
You said I was going back
to be an inspiration.
You never said
I would feel what I'm feeling.
You didn't tell
me that I would...
...see Dorinda.
What do you
really want from me?
We gave you
a chance to say,
"I'm glad I lived.
I'm glad I was alive.
"Now it's my turn
to give you a hand. Let me give you what I had."
But I also sent you
back to settle with the one you love.
I sent you back
to say goodbye.
Until you do that,
she won't be free. And neither will you.
I'm not ready
to say goodbye.
You're such
a good man, Pete.
We don't send
back the other kind.
But you still
have to learn that
to gain your freedom,
you have to give it.
So go find out.
DORINDA:
Shake 'N' Bake, do you read?
Shake 'N' Bake,
this is Tanker Base. Do you read?
TED: I read you,
but I'm a little busy right now.
You've been up a long time.
How's your fuel reading?
How's your fuel?
Ted, leave your mike open.
TED: Okay,
I'm coming in.
He is really low on fuel.
That's beautiful.
How'd you
teach him that?
You don't teach that.
He's got wings. Best I've seen since Pete.
What gives?
Baker coming in on
a wing and a prayer.
You gave my crew
That's all I had.
Jesus.
Another damn hotshot.
Another by god hotshot.
FIREMAN: Right behind you!
Round them up!
There's a cutback over here! Let's go!
MAN: Operations,
this is Smoke Jumper's squad boss!
Say again, over.
Mayday!
We have a major blowout!
Our escape route
has been cut off.
We're by the radio tower
on the south side of Dome Peak.
Our only escape route
is the gully to the southwest.
We're heading for
the Kootenai River.
I can see the waterfall
at the upper end of Bull Lake.
Get on the radio
to the heli-base. Have the choppers standing by.
Libby Operations
to Heli-base.
Ted, those choppers
are 40 miles away. They fly at 100 miles an hour.
Libby Operations
to Heli-base.
We're 12 miles away.
We fly at 220 miles an hour.
WOMAN:
Libby Operations,
this is Heli-base.
We read. Over.
Air Attack, 6-3 Echo,
this is Operations.
We will handle
the incident from here.
Contact the Jumper boss
and ascertain their location.
Hey, Ted.
What are you doing?
Don't worry, Al.
I'll bring him back.
Nails, get me a WAC chart
and sectional for Dome Mountain.
Get everything
you've got together.
I'll take your plane.
It's my plane, I fly it.
We don't have time, Nails.
Get a load of mud and
fill it to the tabs. I'll need all of it.
Not even that
shithead Pete could pull this off.
But he would have tried.
I'll have your
license for this!
I work for the Department
of Agriculture...
Alex, get up on that ridge
and see if we can get to the river!
MAN: Clear!
Dorinda.
You may want to
come down here.
We've got sort
of an emergency.
The wind shifted and
the smoke jumpers...
Ted is going to
fly into the gully above the waterfall.
Yes, honey,
it's dark here, too.
You okay?
I see the water.
But there's a firestorm
on the ridge.
Find out where they're heading
then show me on the map.
How strong are
the winds on the fire?
How about some coordinates?
Powerhouse!
I'd like to be
in on this one.
You might get to.
Al wants to see you.
Great!
Don't cut it.
I'll hold it for you.
Winds from the southwest,
Dorinda, you throttle
back and return
that plane to
the ramp right now.
Honey, we got six poor guys
out there and I need 59 here, right now.
I don't know
what you're doing, but turn this plane around.
You never would
listen to me
and you've always done
fine, but this isn't the same.
This is Ted's mission
and you're not good enough.
You won't make it.
Is that what you want?
That's not my girl.
Damn it, Dorinda!
This is no time to dick around...
...with an airplane!
Let's not be rational.
Throttle.
More throttle.
Level out. Level out!
And you say I flew crazy?
What are you doing? Fly smart.
Those guys need you.
I hear it!
If you've got
water, use it!
Did you see that flare?
There they are.
Make a path for
them to the river.
Ride it.
Ride it, Dorinda.
Slip right. Slip right.
Use the crosswind.
Right rudder.
Here we go. Come on, man.
Drop it now.
Too high!
Anticipation, 500 feet!
You've got to take it lower.
FIREMAN: Can't take
much more of this!
You've got one more load.
You can do it, Dorinda.
Drop into the pocket.
Hold it!
It's too hot!
I know, baby, but
you've got to get lower.
PETE: Throttle.
More throttle.
Ride it.
It's too hot!
PETE: That's it!
Now!
Pull out! Pull out!
FIREMAN: Go for the wet spots!
Go for the wet spots!
Pull out!
Twist out!
That's it. Twisting out!
That's it.
Get up. That's it.
You're going up.
FIREMAN: Head downriver!
This is Tanker 59
to Tanker Base.
I am fine.
The jumpers are
in the clear.
Now I can tell
you everything.
You'll have a
wonderful life, Dorinda.
You won't have
any more bad dreams. You'll go to bed happy
and wake up laughing.
You'll be with people.
You'll have fun.
You'll have everything,
including love.
I could never tell you
how I felt the way I'm telling you now.
I'm only a thought,
which you just think is your own.
But now,
I can say what I've
always wanted to say.
I love you, Dorinda.
I love you.
I should have told you
that a long time ago,
without any jokes.
I should have
said the words
because I know now that
the love we hold back
is the only pain that follows us here.
And the memory
of that love
shouldn't make you unhappy
for the rest of your life.
I hope you can hear me
because I know this is true,
from
the bottom of my heart, how good your life is.
How good it will be.
Can you hear me?
Brush your hair
from your face if you can hear me.
Brush your hair
away from your face one more time,
so I can see your eyes
and say "goodbye."
I'm losing pressure.
Don't worry.
Try to make it to the water.
You can make it.
You can do it.
The water is easy.
PETE: Dorinda.
Dorinda.
I'm right over here.
Look at me.
Pete!
There is the rest
of your life.
I want you to go to them.
I'm releasing you.
I'm moving out
of your heart.
Go on.
Go on.
That's my girl.
And that's my boy.
