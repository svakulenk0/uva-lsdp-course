You must remember, young thespians,
learning is never seasonal.
So, do allow the shimmering lights
of summer to refresh and illuminate
- your fertile young minds.
- What's she talking about?
The future greets you
with its magic mirror,
reflecting each golden moment,
each emboldened choice.
Dude, Miss Darbus
has snapped her cap.
Dude, you're actually listening?
Yes, Jason.
So, what was your favorite
summer memory, Miss Darbus?
Summers have passed fleetingly
since I was your age,
but I remember each
with poignant clarity.
Summer. Summer.
Summer.
BOTH: Summer.
- Summer.
- Summer.
- Summer.
- Summer.
- ALL: Summer. Summer.
- Ashland Shakespeare Festival of...
- Summer. Summer. Summer.
...'88 leaps fondly to mind.

Anticipation.

School's out
Scream and shout.
Finally summer's here.
Good to be chilling out
I'm off the clock
The pressure's off.
Now my girl's what it's all about.
Ready for some sunshine.
- For my heart to take a chance.
- Oh, yeah
I'm here to stay, not moving away.
Ready for a summer romance.
Everybody's ready, going crazy
Yeah, we're out.
Come on and let me hear you
say it now, right now.
What time is it?

The time of our lives.
Anticipation.

Summertime.
School's out
Scream and shout.
Goodbye to rules
No summer school
I'm free to shop till I drop.
It's an education vacation.
And the party never has to stop.
We've got things to do
We'll see you soon.
And we're really gonna miss you all.
Goodbye to you and you.
And you and you.
Bye-bye until next fall.
Everybody ready, going crazy

The time of our lives.
Anticipation.

Summertime.
School's out
Scream and shout.
No more waking up at 6:00 A.M.
'Cause now our time is all our own.
Enough already, we're waiting
Come on, let's go.
Go out of control.
All right.
Everybody.
Yeah.
Come on.
School pride, let's show it
We're champions and we know it.
Wildcats, yeah, are the best, yeah.
Red, white and gold.
When it's time to win, we do it.
We're number one, we proved it.
Let's live it up, yeah, party down.
That's what this summer's all about.
What time is it?
Summertime is finally here
Yeah.
Let's celebrate.
We wanna hear you
loud and clear now.
School's out.
We can sleep as late as we want to.
It's our time.
Now we can do
whatever we wanna do.
What time is it?
It's summertime.
We'll be loving it.
Come on and say it again now.
What time is it?
It's party time
Party time.
Let's go and have the time of our lives.
Let's go.
Yeah
Yeah!
No, but seriously, guys,
this summer I gotta make bank.
My parents keep talking about
how much college is gonna cost.
Yeah, my folks are gonna match
whatever I make,
but I gotta get hired first.
Me, too. I'm saving up for a car,
so I can take that little hottie
on a proper date.
Gabriella.
I understand you've moved
every summer for the past five years,
and I'd hate to think today is goodbye.
No worries. My mom promised
I'm here until graduation next year.
Bless Mom's little heart.
Sharpay, we got off to a rough start,
but you really came through.
I mean, you helped me
with the winter musical.
I did?
Those vocal exercises?
See you.
Gabriella and I have
had, like, five job interviews,
but we keep getting beat out
by college kids.
Yeah, same here. I guess I'm back
in the babysitting business.
Hey, Martha. Hey, Taylor.
Hey, Kelsi, what are you planning
to do this summer?
Grow, write music. Grow.
Your summer activities consultant
has arrived.
Hopefully some of those activities
will include a job.
Hey, whatever happens, as long
as we're together, it's cool, right?
You promise?
Here's my promise.
- "T" as in Troy?
- Well, I... Yeah.
Hey, man, how's it going?
There you go, boss.
Hoops. Let's go.
Yeah, sure, sure.
We're not busy or anything. Let's go.
Troy: We could go to the movies,
download music.
Oh, I'm definitely teaching you
a twisted-flip on the skateboard.
Oh, and I have first-aid training,
so I can patch myself up afterwards.
All right!
"Going to movies, listening to music.
"And, golly, Troy,
I have first-aid training."
Oh, please.
Oh. Come here, Kelsi.
I have a summer job for you.
At our country club.
Our rehearsal pianist
is evidently moving.
Or hiding.
- Pardon?
- Sounds great.
Cheer up, Shar, it's summer.
We can do whatever we want to.
Everything changes.
Ryan, who's the absolute primo boy
at East High?
I'd say Troy Bolton has that category
pretty much locked up, don't you think?
And East High's primo girl?
- Just answer the question!
- Gosh, you?
Troy, Sharpay.
Sharpay, Troy. Sharpay...
Shar.
- It just makes sense.
- Evidently not to Troy.
But it's summer, Ry.
Everything changes.
What time is it?
Summertime.
Hey
it's our vacation.
What time is it?
Party time.
That's right
Say it loud.
What time is it?
The time of our lives.
Anticipation.
What time is it?
Summertime.
School's out
Scream and shout.
Troy: Nice workout, fellas.
- I'm starving.
- Me, too.
I'll tell you what. I'm seeing moves
I didn't see last season.
- Keep it coming, guys!
- Yeah. What team?
ALL: Wildcats!
All right!
Yo, time for milk.
- So, guys, how's the job hunt coming?
- The big zero.
- Uh-oh. Girlfriend alert.
- Talk to me.
This is Thomas Fulton,
General Manager
of Lava Springs Country Club
here in Albuquerque.
I understand you've been looking
for summer work.
Hey, Troy, does Gabriella
still remember your name,
or did she find somebody new
to karaoke with this summer?
That sounds fantastic, Mr. Fulton.
But how did you get my name?
Well, we've always had
a student summer work program
here at Lava Springs.
So, are you ready?
Here's the thing. I know the most
amazing girl... I mean, student.
Straight A's, quintuple straight A's,
and it would be
so amazingly perfect if...
Man, he's really working someone.
It can't be Gabriella.
Whenever she calls, he just blushes.
Yeah, I never said that.
Yes!
- What's up, dog?
- Nothing. Nothing. Nothing!
Okay. I'll tell you what,
you guys stick together this summer,
you work on the game,
and we are talking back-to-back
- championships next fall.
- Yeah!
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Can we all redirect this energy
by carrying in the groceries?
- Yes, Mrs. Bolton.
- Yes, Mrs. Bolton.
MAN ON RADIO: Hey,
we're kicking off another hot summer
here in Albuquerque.
So, for those cool enough
to have a convertible,
crank up the sound,
breathe that fresh air,
and say hello to summer!
Miss Evans, Mr. Evans,
looking very sharp this summer.
Welcome back to Lava Springs.
Thank you, Charles.
Hi, boy!
Oh, can you find
some shade for my car?
- Even if we have to plant a tree.
- Fulton.
And may I say, welcome back.
It's good to be home.
Are the flyers ready?
This year we embossed the flyers
for the show.
Inspired.
I plan to limit member talent
auditions to 30 seconds each.
Amateur performers are very...
- Draining?
- Yes.
Understood.
And should I...
We be so fortunate as to win
the Star Dazzle Award again.
But where would we put it?
We're planning on expanding
the trophy case.
The designs are in my office.
- Fulton, you are so efficient.
- Well...
The staffing matter we discussed?
Done. With discretion.
Fabulous.
- Oh, stop it. Yes. Yes.
- SHARPAY: Ryan!
- ALL: Sharpay!
- Girls.
Your chaise in its usual spot,
Miss Evans?
Thank you, Javier.
Emma, Jackie and Lea, east of me.
Oh, and you'll be a prince to angle our
chaises on the hour, as the sun moves.
Well, thanks to the kind words
from your mother last season,
I've been promoted.
But, no worries,
I'll make sure that the new lifeguard
is fully briefed
on just how you like things.
So, what's the theme of
the summer talent show, Sharpay?
- Redemption.
- Love it.
It was a very trying year, ladies.
My drama department
was invaded by outsiders,
singers coming from the chemistry lab
and locker room. Shocking, really.
Sis, we've got the pool, the entire club,
and the whole summer to enjoy it.
And the spa has been redone.
There's a guacamole facial and
a seaweed body scrub on the menu.
What could be more fabulous?
- More ice.
- Right away, Miss Evans.
It's out with the old
And in with the new.
Goodbye, clouds of gray
Hello, skies of blue.
A dip in the pool
A trip to the spa.
Endless days in my chaise
The whole world according to moi.
Excuse me.
Thank you.
Iced tea imported from England.
Lifeguards imported from Spain.
Towels imported from Turkey.
And Turkey imported from Maine.
We're gonna relax and renew.
You go do
I want fabulous
That is my simple request.
All things fabulous
Bigger and better and best
I need something inspiring
to help me get along
I need a little fabulous
ls that so wrong?
Fetch me my Jimmy Choo flip-flops.
Where is my pink Prada tote?
I need my Tiffany hair-band.
Then I can go for a float.
A summer like never before
I want more.
She wants fabulous
That is her simple request.
All things fabulous
Bigger and better and best.
She needs something inspiring
to help her get along.
She needs a little fabulous
ls that so wrong?
Fabulous pool.
Fabulous splash.
Read my lips.
Fabulous parties
Even fabulous trash.
Fabulous fashion.
No.
Fabulous bling.
Yeah.
She's got to have fabulous everything.
Nothing to discuss.
Everything's got to be perfect for...
Me!
She wants fabulous
That is her simple request.
All things fabulous
Bigger and better and best.
She needs something inspiring
to help her get along.
She needs a little fabulous
ls that so wrong?
This won't do
That's a bore.
That's insulting
I need more
I need, I need, I need
I need, I need, I need
I need fabulous
I want fabulous.
Fabulous hair, fabulous style.
Fabulous eyes and that fabulous smile.
Oh, I like what I see
I like it a lot.
Is this absolutely fabulous?
Fabulous, fabulous, fabulous.
Absolutely.
Not.
Yeah!
Gabriella: I got you.
I got you. It's okay.
- What are you doing here?
- I'm the new lifeguard.
Wait, are you a member here?
I told you to hire Troy Bolton,
not the entire East High student body!
You told me to hire Troy Bolton.
"Whatever it takes."
Well, why didn't you warn me
about the rest of them?
I did discuss the matter
with the Lava Springs board, of course.
The board. You mean, our...
Mother!
Gabriella Montez and the Wildcats?
Mother, how could you?
Think of your future, kitten.
These are your school chums,
not the fuddy-duddy Lava Springs staff.
These are not my chums!
They'll steal my talent show.
And what fresh talent
you'll have for your summer show.
Mother, did you hear what I just said?
Ryan, talk to Mother.
- Hi, Mom.
- Ducky! How's my dashing boy?
Tell pumpkin if she worries too much,
she'll get frown lines.
Namaste.
- I want them out!
- But your mother specifically said...
Oh, don't mention
that backstabbing yogini to me!
If you can't fire them,
make them wanna quit.
I'm hoping Chef Michael's
gonna teach me
the art of Austrian flake pastry.
And Sharpay's gonna be
where I work every day.
How much better can summer get?
Right? Right?
- A real dream come true.
- If you actually get to know her,
- I mean she's...
- Dude.
Hey, I didn't even know
Sharpay's parents owned this place.
Mr. Fulton just said, you know,
there's Wildcat fans at Lava Springs,
and jobs are available.
So, I said let's go for it.
Inspiring, Mr. Bolton. Truly inspiring.
However, what we're looking for
from all of you,
is not inspiration, but perspiration.
Confirming assignments.
Bolton, Danforth, waiters.
And, when needed, caddies.
What?
Miss McKessie,
I'm told that you're efficient.
- Well...
- Prove it.
You'll handle member activities.
Keep me in sight at all times.
Kelsi, piano.
Lunchtime and cocktail hour.
That means mood music,
not new music.
Capisce?
Martha, chopping, cutting,
preparing plates.
Do complete the summer
with the equal amount of digits
I assume you currently possess.
Oh, Zeke, you will assist Chef Michael
in the...
The promised land.
You hold on to that.
Mr. Fulton, Your Excellency, sir,
would it be okay if we draw straws
to see who has to wait on Sharpay?
Please, none of you
will be waiting on Sharpay.
Oh, yes. Snap.
- You will be serving Miss Evans.
- Who's that?
Always address our members as Mr.,
Mrs., or Miss. Let's practice.
- Do we have to?
- Shall we?
"Miss Evans,
would you care for lemonade?"
Actually, I'm not Miss Evans. I'm Jason.
- It smells so good and I am so hungry.
- No, wait. You don't...
- No, no, no.
- Gabriella: What's for lunch?
Miss Montez.
It would seem your lunch break
does not start for 3.5 minutes.
I do hope no members drowned
in your absence.
Henceforth, do clock in
and out on time.
Three infractions of any kind,
and your employment is terminated.
Capisce?
Chop, chop, chop.
- Okay, that man officially scares me.
- Yeah.
Suddenly, I'm beginning to miss
detention with Miss Darbus.
- How sick is that?
- Come on.
We got a hoop out back,
two free meals a day,
and we only have to wear
these stupid outfits on duty.
All for one, and one for all. All right?
- This is our summer. Now, what team?
- ALL: Wildcats!
- What team?
- Wildcats!
Come on.
How did we get from the top
of the world to the bottom of the heap?
I don't recall you mentioning
the boss is such a creep.
We still have the ingredients
to make this summer sweet.
Well, we got rags instead of riches.
And all these dirty dishes.
Just wish I had three wishes.
Okay, guys, break it up.
We've got to work, work
to work this out.
We'll make things right
The sun will shine.
If we work, work, there'll be no doubt.
We can still save the summer
if we work this out.
Dude, what have you gotten us into?
Come on.
We can totally turn this thing around!
I'd rather face a seven footer
straight up in the post.
Yeah
That sure beats hanging here.
And burning someone's toast
I needed Benjamins
But this ain't worth the stress.
Maybe there's a better way
to fix this greasy mess.
We're a champion team
A well-oiled machine.
And we've faced tougher problems
than this
I know it's a grind
But I'm sure we can find.
A way to have fun
while we get this job done.
We've got to work, work
to work this out.
We'll make things right
The sun will shine.
We got to work, work
There'll be no doubt.
If we all come together
We can work this out.
Let's work it!
Tell me what you want.
Tell me what you need.
A little bit of sugar.
A little bit of butter.
It's the perfect recipe.
Payday
it'll taste so sweet.
Payday
Good enough to eat.
Gonna make some motion pictures.
Hit the mall with all my sisters.
Get tickets to the Knicks and Sixers.
Kick it with the music mixers.
Buy a ride that suits my style.
Lounge around the pool awhile.
Make a date with my favorite girl.
We've got it made.
Whoa, we've got to work, work
to work this out.
We'll make things right
The sun will shine.
If we work, work, there'll be no doubt.
We can still save the summer
if we work this out.
Work this
Got to work this.
We can work this out.
So, can we work this out?
Yeah, we can work it out.
FULTON: Send the waiters right in.
Miss me? Of course you did.
Hey, you ever been on a golf course?
We're employees, Troy. Not members.
And I don't play golf.
Who said anything about golf?
Are you sure it's okay for us
to be out here?
Yeah, unless the jackrabbits turn us in.
So, how's kitchen duty?
Oh, you know, the team that
washes dishes together, wins together.
My mom said summer jobs look good
on college applications.
All part of the frightening concept
called "our future."
Are you worried?
Hey, college costs a fortune.
My parents are saving pennies,
unlike the people at this place.
You're a cinch for a scholarship.
I'm only as good as whatever happens
next season. It's...
I always liked the idea of
being in charge of my future,
until it actually started happening.
So, let's just think about right now,
because I've never been in one place
for an entire summer,
and this means a lot to me,
especially being here with...
Such an outstanding peanut-butter
and-jelly-sandwich maker like me?
I want to remember this summer, Troy.
- Here, catch.
- Oh, I love this game.
- Ready?
- Go.
- Beautiful.
- Very nice! Oh. Your turn.
- You didn't catch a single one of them.
- You...
Troy: That was so bad.
Fulton, when I was
on the fourth fairway today,
it seemed bone dry.
Oh, no way!
Could you tell maintenance
to give it a little extra splash?
No way!
- May I have this dance?
- Why, of course you may.
Let's go then.
You are gonna get so wet!
Yeah!
Keep an eye on them tomorrow
and keep me posted.
Why are you smiling?
No worries, Ryan.
This is our turf, remember?
First a break-time infraction,
now frolicking on the golf course.
We are not off to an auspicious start,
are we, Miss Montez?
Actually, Mr. Fulton, this was my idea,
so she's...
How gallant, but irrelevant.
We won't allow this to happen again,
will we?
Good morning, everybody.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Smells good. That smells good.
- Hey, Martha.
- Hey.
- Hey, Jason.
- Hey, morning.
- What's up?
Yeah
You are the music in me.
- Sounding good, Kels.
- Thanks.
Actually, I need to go get ready
for the ladies' luncheon.
Won't exactly be rocking out.
You know, I am so excited
about the club's talent show.
I mean, the employees
get to do a number,
and I have ideas for everyone.
You guys can sing the lead,
and maybe Zeke and Chad
can do backup,
and everyone can dance.
Big timeout on that one.
My singing career began and ended
with the East High Winter Musical.
I'm just here to make a check
and sneak in the pool after work.
That's... That's really it.
Oh.
What was that
you were playing a minute ago?
Oh, it's... It's nothing. It's just nothing.
What's this?
Well, I was thinking
if you'd do the show,
that I wanted to be ready,
and I wrote this for you guys.
Come on. Go.
Yeah.
You are the music in me.
You know the words
"Once upon a time"
Make you listen, there's a reason.
When you dream
There's a chance you'll find.
A little laughter, or happy ever after.
You're harmony to the melody.
That's echoing inside my head.
A single voice above the noise.
And like a common thread.
You're pulling me.
When I hear my favorite song
I know that we belong.
Oh, you are the music in me.
Yeah, it's living in all of us.
And it's brought us here because.
Because you are the music in me
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You are the music in me.
It's like I knew you before we met
Can't explain it.
There's no name for it
I sang you words I've never said.
- And it was easy.
- So easy.
Because you see the real me.
As I am, you understand.
And that's more than
I've ever known, oh.
To hear your voice above the noise.
And know I'm not alone.
Oh, you're singing to me.
When I hear my favorite song
I know that we belong.
You are the music in me.
It's living in all of us.
And it's brought us here because.
You are the music in me.
Together we're gonna sing.
We got the power to sing what we feel.
Connected and real.
Can't keep it all inside.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You are the music in me.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
You are the music in me.
When I hear my favorite song
I know that we belong.
We belong.
You are the music in me.
It's living in all of us
it's brought us here because.
You are the music in me.
Oh yeah
Oh yeah.
You are the music in me.
Yeah
- Oh, I love that song.
- Troy: Great job, Kels.
Oh, I've got the talent show sign-up
sheet right here. Are you in?
Maybe we can work this out,
but only if we're all in this together.
Yeah!
This is going to be fantastic.
I'm going to coordinate rehearsal
to coincide with all of our schedules.
Goldenthroat, this is Jazz Square.
We may have trouble.
Ryan: Now, it's an amazing song,
but Kelsi didn't write it for us.
Hi, Mom.
- Seaweed scrub, darling?
- Maybe later.
Ryan, it might be wonderful
if Troy participates in our talent show.
What? If he sings with Gabriella
then our whole show is going to be
the "Troy and Gabriella Show."
I'm not certain Gabriella
is ideally suited
to help Troy realize his full potential
at Lava Springs.
Mommy, what time
is Daddy gonna be here?
We tee off at noon. Join us?
Love to.
Up. And how shall
we get to the food today, sir?
- I don't know, perhaps skipping.
- Very well then.
Shall we?
Hipty scouty, hipty skipty,
hipty skipty, hipty skipty...
Danforth, Bolton,
you're caddying today.
$40 a bag. You've been requested.
- What?
- By who?
Dude, who cares?
For $40, I'd caddy for Godzilla.
Close, very close.
Thank you.
- Thanks.
- Thanks, man.
Hey, boys! So, Troy, I thought
it was time for you to meet my parents.
Oh.
Enchantee.
- Awesome.
- Hi.
Hello.
So, where's your dad?
SHARPAY: Hi, Daddy!
Where's the first tee
and what's the course record?
I'm just kidding. I built the course
myself and I hold the record,
but who's counting? Princess.
- Son, you've been working out.
- Yoga.
Bring that around, there you go.
Quite a season you boys had.
Oh, Troy played
for the golf team, too, Daddy.
Oh, versatile. How about you, son?
- Baseball. Track and field.
- Outstanding.
Might come in handy the way
I play golf. Fair warning.
Fore!
- Brilliant, darling. Brilliant.
- Lovely.
Chad, you'll be caddying for Mother.
Troy, Daddy.
BOTH: Daddy.
Bravo!
Brilliant. Let's take a walk.
- Is that a new outfit?
- Yes, just this morning. And yours?
Mr. Evans: This old thing?
I got it last week.
Come on, Chad.
What do you think?
Well, it's 190 to the pin,
downhill lie, elevated green.
I'd go with a full five, sir.
Hi.
- Nice call.
- All right.
Princess, grab your pitching wedge.
This one's yours.
Thanks, Daddy.
Mr. Evans: Line it up.
Oops.
That's my girl.
That girl needs to take up knitting.
Or some sport
where she can only injure herself.
- I'm in the sand.
- Me, too.
Knees, hips, shoulders, hat.
Good. Drill it.
Backboard.
BOTH: Yes!
That's my boy.
- Where...
- I have no idea.
Gabriella! Dinner tonight?
Sneak a swim?
Troy!
- Oh, lovely, darling.
- Nice.
Daddy, why not let Troy try a shot?
- Of course. Of course.
- No, I shouldn't.
- Come on.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah!
- Mr. Evans: Yes, sir.
- Are you sure it's okay, Mr. Evans?
- It sure is.
- Give it a ride.
- Thank you.
- Here you go, Daddy.
- Thank you, dear.
Mr. Evans: That's a beautiful swing.
Mrs. Evans: Really beautiful.
That is a beautiful swing.
- Chad: That was awesome.
- Thanks, man.
- Come on! What do you say we...
- What? I don't know.
Mr. Evans: Off we go.
I'm saving up for a car.
I'm saving up for a car.
Well, Tiger Woods would
have been proud to make that putt!
What a shame that Troy
is only bussing dishes all summer,
given that he's a potential star
for your Alma mater, Daddy.
I've seen Troy play basketball.
I think the U of A Redhawks
will be very interested in him.
That's inspired, Daddy.
Troy is very concerned about college.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- How's Coach Bolton these days?
- Oh, fantastic.
Outstanding.
What?
Oh, next time
I see Country Club Princess,
I'm gonna launch her and her pink cart
straight into the lake.
I'll build the ramp, buddy.
Danforth, this is a kitchen,
not a day spa.
You and Jason suit up for dinner duty
in the dining room.
Bolton, you have five minutes
to change and come with me.
In case you're not familiar
with this particular item,
it goes around your neck,
like a dog collar.
Chop-chop.
- And she stepped on the ball.
- I did not.
- Yes, you did.
- MAN: I can believe that.
Hey! Here's our superstar.
Troy Bolton, this is Peter.
- Peter. Good to meet you.
- How are you?
- This is Claire.
- Hello.
- And you know the family.
- Hello.
This kid's pretty handy on the fairways
as well as the hard court.
Bet you worked up yourself an appetite
lugging those bags
all over the place, huh?
Yeah, yeah. A little bit.
What do you say we get some food,
and we can talk about your future.
- My future?
- Yeah, sit down.
Peter: Have a seat.
Daddy's on the board of directors
at the University of Albuquerque.
So, Troy, I saw your
championship game. I mean, wow!
That last-second shot at the buzzer...
Outstanding.
Actually, my teammates here
stole the ball,
otherwise I wouldn't have
had a chance...
Oh, you're much too modest, Troy.
You were voted MVP
for the entire season.
This shirt positively screams
for a Windsor knot.
- Thank you.
- Let me get that for you.
You know, we've got a heck of
a basketball program over at U of A,
and an excellent
scholarship program as well.
Scholarship?
Yeah. You know,
between the two of us here,
we... We pull a little weight over
at the school.
Well, time flies when you're having fun,
but Mr. Fulton will probably
want me clocking out.
Come on. Don't be silly.
You haven't had any dessert,
and we haven't talked about golf, yet.
Oh, basketball and golf are
just the beginning with Troy, Daddy.
Have you heard him sing?
Mr. Evans: Oh, triple threat.
Oh, how wonderful.
Troy can participate in the talent show.
Oh, come on, Troy.
Give them a sample. Kelsi!
Kelsi. No, actually my voice is...
Is feeling a little bit hoarse tonight,
you know, all the talking.
But thank you very much for the food
and the golf and everything.
It was amazing.
But you will sing some other time,
though? With me. Promise?
- Promise.
- Perfect.
Dessert?
Sorry I'm late!
Give me two more minutes.
Nice tie. Your shoes
don't match though. Kidding.
Honey, two minutes is being late,
but an hour is approaching a felony.
Just because Troy's a nice guy, doesn't
mean he's immune to boy disease.
Boy disease?
Yeah, forgetting things
he shouldn't forget.
Oh, so now you're a boy expert?
My older sister has 10 rules
about boy behavior,
and nine of them involve boys
forgetting things
they should never forget,
like dinner dates.
Well, it wasn't an official date
type of thing.
Rule number three,
all dates are official,
whether the boy knows it or not.
- You're not done.
- But I'm done for the day, sir.
And actually, I have a date.
Mr. Bolton, you're under
the mistaken impression
I'm interested in what you have to say.
Just follow me.
- But I...
- No more speaking.
- Hey, where are we going?
- Please, Mr. Bolton.
- How long is this gonna take?
- Watch your step. Insurance issues.
I'm supposed to have a date tonight.
But the evening is young
and so are you.
Well, where are we?
Hold your applause until the very end.
What the heck? Mr. Fulton?
A long time ago
In a land far away.
Lived the pineapple princess, Tiki.
She was sweet as a peach
In a pineapple way.
But so sad that she hardly speaky.
Still, if you listen well
You'll hear her secret wish.
Aloha, everybody, my name is Tiki.
I long to free
A truly remarkable fish.
My sweet prince.
Humu, humu, nuku, nuku, a pua'a.
Makahiki malihini who.
Humu, humu, nuku, nuku, a pua'a
Ooh.
Hawana waka, waka, waka
Niki pu, pu, pu
Ryan, the fog!
Ryan:  She dreams of a boy
Who is under a spell.
That has left him all wet and scaly
I sing from my heart
Of the power of love.
Just a girl with a ukulele.
- Come to me.
- Come to her.
- My sweet one, and be still.
- Be still
I'll grasp your tail
Then stroke each tender gill.
My sweet prince.
Humu, humu, nuku, nuku, a pua'a.
Makahiki malihini who.
Humu, humu, nuku, nuku, a pua'a
Ooh.
Hawana waka, waka, waka
Niki pu, pu, pu.
Now this is where we lead
into the whole Kabuki thing.
The clouds turned gray
And the big sky cried.
And the ocean had a fit
Ryan! Where's my ocean?
Then the wind went whoosh
And thunder cracked.
And mighty Mount Fufu spit
Mighty Mount Fufu spit.
Tiki, Tiki
Want to speaky, speaky, speaky.
With the mighty spirit Fufu.
Tiki, Tiki
Want to speaky, speaky, speaky.
- The words I will not mince.
- Word!
Please make a man
Of my fresh fish prince.
This is real fish talk. No lie.
And then the fish turns
into a gorgeous prince and sings...
I'm Prince Humu
Humu, nuku, nuku, a pua'a.
No. No way.
Makahiki malihini who.
With me.
Humu, humu, nuku, nuku, a pua'a.
Hawana waka, waka, waka
Niki pu, pu, pu.
Everybody!
Humu, humu, nuku, nuku, a pua'a.
Makahiki malihini who.
Humu, humu, nuku, nuku, a pua'a.
Hawana waka, waka, waka
Niki pu, pu, pu.
Waka, waka, waka
Niki pu, pu, pu.
Waka, waka, waka
Niki pu, pu, pu.
One minute.
SHARPAY: We'll talk about this later.
So, you love it?
Look, you ever tried just singing?
I mean, without all the lights and sets
and, like, backup people?
Well, it'd be much harder
to get applause that way.
I'm not talking about applause.
I'm talking about hanging out
with friends.
You know, doing nothing,
and singing for fun.
Wait a minute.
Not doing anything.
That might work.
A dark stage, a single spotlight.
We break out of darkness
into the circle of light.
- Wait, "we"?
- No set, no frills.
- Oh, man.
- Simple.
Dramatic. Just you and me.
That is such a great idea, Troy.
We could do it at our club talent show.
Look, I'm here to work.
Sharpay, I already told you
being onstage really is your thing,
it's not mine.
It could be our thing.
Time out on that one,
okay? I've got an "our thing,"
it's with Gabriella, and...
And I'm very late for her, so I got to go.
- But the show could be so amazing...
- I love your shoes.
- You like them?
- I really do.
I bought them in New York.
I have them in nine colors.
Girls! Again from the top.
Hey, lifeguard!
You're crazy, Wildcat!
And so late, but I brought food,
a few little candles.
I'm good for a poolside picnic.
What do you say?
Zeke even made desserts.
But first, I dare you to jump in.
You know we're not supposed
to be in the pool. Club rules.
Cramp!
I need a lifeguard!
Rescue me! Rescue me!
Here I come!
Thanks for coming in. Follow me.
Oh, listen.
You know, right now, with you,
it's finally starting to feel like summer.
Yeah, it is.
The water bugs are back.
Look, Mr. Fulton, this was my idea,
she had nothing to do with it.
I generously overlooked
your previous break violation,
but then came the golf course jaunt,
and now this. Two strikes.
Don't get a third. Out of the pool.
Sharpay's dad let me play a few holes
and then invited me to dinner
with some U of A alumni.
Really?
And they were talking
about scholarships,
while Jason and Chad
were, like, serving me.
And getting paid for it. It's called a job.
You were invited,
nothing wrong with that.
Yeah. I don't know. It felt weird.
I love that you've got the team
working together,
but you're not gonna be
a Wildcat forever.
The team is now, and that's... It's good,
but everybody's got their own future.
I'm not sure I know what you mean.
Well, when you graduate,
lots of people are gonna be
chasing the same opportunities.
There's nothing wrong with
keeping your eye on the prize.
In fact, if you don't, you get left behind.
Yeah, I know, I'm just saying,
I didn't get my friends jobs at the club
so they could sit and watch me
eat in the dining room.
You know, I'm just saying
never be ashamed of attention,
as long as you've earned it.
You know, a scholarship's special,
that's why there's only a few
to go around.
Yeah, yeah. I get it, Dad.
Okay. So, how was the food
at Lava Springs?
Insanely good.
- Take it out for a spin.
- No way.
Well, you didn't think I was going
to drive this heap, did you?
Yes! Yes!
Okay, bring those knees up as high
as you can and circle those arms.
Hey, water bug. Last night was so fun.
I really didn't mean
to get you in trouble.
Same here.
- So, maybe today we can have our...
- SHARPAY: Troy?
What time is your lunch break?
Troy!
- 1:30.
- 1:30, great.
Free cheeseburgers are on me.
Everybody looks great. Awesome job.
Okay, now, some jumping Jacks.
Hey. What is she up to?
- Who knows?
- Believe me, she does.
I'm sorry I'm late, Mr. Fulton,
but about the pool thing last night,
you can't blame Gabriella...
- I'm promoting you.
- You're what?
There's an opening
as an assistant to the golf pros.
Salaried job, no clocking in.
- But, I...
- $500 a week, plus tips.
What? Per week?
Oh, my... That's off the hook!
I think it sounds very manageable.
Shall we?
FULTON: Bolton!
- Wait. So you want me to teach golf?
- To kids. Oh, the joy.
- But, sir, I don't think I'm qualified.
- Worry not.
Simply show the little angels
which end of the club to hold,
tee the ball up, then duck.
In addition, the board is extending
membership privileges to you.
You have complete use
of club facilities, but do so prudently,
meaning, fellow Wildcats? Not.
Congratulations.
You'll find an appropriate choice
of clothing here.
Do not mix checks with plaids,
blue with browns,
and avoid wearing white socks
at all cost.
Leave your shoes outside the locker,
they will be buffed and polished
each evening.
Yes! Oh, man!
Save it for the first tee.
And to get there,
this might come in handy.
That's the key to your golf cart.
Number 14.
The same number that's on your
basketball uniform, so I'm told.
Questions?
How did this happen?
It would seem that the Evans family
thinks you have untapped potential.
Young man,
the future is full of uncharted waters,
and this family has real clout,
so I suggest you take the ride.
Yeah.
Italian.
Awesome, junior golfers!
You guys look amazing!
Hey! Hey! Slow down, champ.
Slow down.
Save some for the other kids.
There you go.
Cool shorts, buddy.
All right. Hey. Hey, cutie.
Try holding the club that way,
you're going to hit it way farther.
All right. Nice backswing, man.
Nice backswing.
Good job, killer. Make the ball fear you.
You look good. Great job, everybody.
Good job, guys!
- Bolton. Bolton. Your 11:30 is here.
- Thanks, man.
Good luck, buddy.
Troy!
Oh, man.
- Cool balls.
- Thanks.
You're welcome.
By the end of summer,
you'll have me playing like a pro.
Yeah.
If I live that long.
I'm so excited about the show.
Oh, and don't worry.
We'll find something great to do.
Look, Sharpay, I already told you,
singing really isn't my thing.
And here's the best news,
all the Redhawk boosters will be there.
- Really?
- Of course.
We'll lock up your scholarship
with a high "C" right from center stage.
We're all in this together, right?
Your parents have been really,
really nice, Sharpay,
but singing with you
isn't a part of my job.
I know,
just something you promised to do.
Remember?
You look fabulous in your new clothes,
by the way.
- You like the shoes? They're Italian.
- Nice.
Let me show you how this is done.
It's really easy.
Just line up to your target.
Nice, easy backswing.
- Hey, Gab.
- Hey!
That girl's got more moves than
an octopus in a wrestling match.
- Nah. He knows how to swim.
- Yeah. Troy can handle himself.
I did overhear him asking her
for her opinion
on his new Italian golf shoes.
He didn't ask me.
So, wake up, sister! She's basically
offering him a college education
just to sing with her in the talent show.
- Troy would never do that.
- Taylor: You got eyes, use them.
- Let's go eat.
- Yeah, I got to go. Hey, see you later?
- Okay.
- Okay.
You're going to take it back
and through.
- Troy, Fulton wants you in the lobby.
- Fantastic. Thank you. See you.
And she steps on the ball.
- Troy Bolton. This is...
- I've seen them all play at U of A.
Oh, all right.
Well, come scrimmage at our gym.
It'll be good for your game.
- Play with you guys?
- Yeah. Let's get down, bro.
- Awesome.
- All right.
- Let's all get some awesome lunch.
- Yeah.
I knew it! Coral blue!
It's perfect for your skin tone.
And mine, too!
We are majorly skin-tone compatible,
Troy.
- I have no idea what that means.
- You don't need to. I'm here for you.
- Who's hungry?
- Let's eat.
I mean, how can you hit the ball
straight if your clubs don't trust you?
- That's the key. So, it's all in the grip.
- Okay.
You got to hold it just right.
That looks great.
Hey, I almost forgot.
I ordered Swiss on my burger.
So, go ahead and check it out, man.
Try it. See what you think.
Danforth, table three
needs more iced tea.
Now, rotate your hands over the top.
- Put your thumb on that side.
- Okay.
There you go, man. You're good.
I'll see you on the course.
- Yeah. Let's do it, man.
- Yeah.
- Zeke! Troy wants Swiss.
- Coming right up.
You know, you were right.
There's a guy out there
that looks just like Troy Bolton,
but I have no idea who he really is.
Oh, hey.
Kelsi's got some great new ideas
- to spice up the talent show. It's got...
- I'm thrilled.
That new duet
that Troy and Gabriella sang? I need it.
- Actually, it's not available.
- Repeat.
Well, it's something I wrote
for Troy and Gabriella,
just in case they decide to...
You're an employee,
not a fairy godmother. Let's have it.
Transpose it into my key. Troy and I
will be doing it in the talent show.
Oh, and brighten up the tempo.
We'll need to keep people awake.
What about our song?
- What about Humu Humu?
- Change in plans.
What am I supposed to do
with my Tiki Warrior outfit?
Save it for Halloween, go to a luau,
sell it online. I don't know!
But in the meantime,
keep an eye on those Wildcats.
If they're planning on
being in the show,
which I doubt,
once they hear about Troy and me,
I don't want any surprises.
Oh, and don't worry,
I'll find a song for you
somewhere in the show.
- Or the next show.
- Really?
Don't strain yourself, slick.
Entertainers are so temperamental.
Transpose!
Look at you.
- Go, team.
- Yeah. It's a gift from the guys.
The "guys"?
Oh, you mean all those tall people?
Yeah. Yeah.
Hey, look. I got to go in a minute,
but I'll be back in about an hour.
I'll pick you up in my new truck
and we'll go to a movie. I promise.
"Promise" is a really big word, Troy.
Yeah. I know.
And we've got
the staff baseball game after work.
Remember, you "promised"
that you'd play?
Right. Right. Baseball.
I will absolutely meet you there.
- You forgot, didn't you?
- No. I just got the date mixed up.
And I'm sorry
I couldn't make lunch today. I just...
It's been wild, you know?
I can't believe
how things are working out here.
So I see. Italian golf shoes,
new clothes, golf carts.
That's crazy stuff.
Hard to keep track of it all, I bet.
So, what's your point?
It just doesn't seem like new stuff,
it seems like a new Troy.
All right, let's see if Tiger Woods
still has a jump shot.
- Hey, hey, Bolton! Come on!
- Hey!
Why don't you tell them
to come over here and mix it up?
We'll show them some game.
You know,
I don't think that's how they roll.
That's not how they "roll"?
No, no, no, that's not what I meant.
I just think it's a closed practice. Sorry.
Wow. Well,
maybe you can get us a video?
Bolton, come on!
But yesterday you said we were
going to play two-on-two after work,
- before the baseball game.
- I know. I know, man. I'm sorry.
Come on, Zeke, that was so yesterday.
You know, when we were all on a team!
- Hey, man.
- Hey, how's it going?
Hey, Bolton! That's my ball.
- Here we go!
- How's it going, guys?
Would you guys be mad at me
if I ask him to get me
one of those cool Redhawk jackets?
Hey. Come on.
I'm so excited about the game.
It's going to be so cool.
Hey, Ryan. No rehearsals?
My sister is working up something new.
So, you coming to the baseball game?
I'm not staff. Wasn't invited.
Hey, everyone's invited.
Come on. Hop in.
All right.
Hold on!
All right! Right here!
Taylor: Beep, beep!
Beep, beep!
What, did Fulton send you out here
to spy on us?
Nah, my sister did.
She thinks you guys are going to
upstage her talent show.
Oh, no worries.
We were going to do the show,
but then Troy bailed on us,
so, whatever.
What do you mean "whatever"?
It's our summer, remember?
I thought we decided
doing the show would be fun.
- Well, I think so.
- Me, too.
- Who are we kidding?
- I don't think so.
We don't know
how to put together a show.
No, but he does.
If we have a real director
putting it together, it could be great.
Have the employees ever won
a Star Dazzle Award?
- Hey, now...
- I know what you can do, Ryan,
- so why not do it for us?
- All right, look,
if you want to play ball,
then grab a mitt, but I don't dance.
You don't think dancing
takes some game?
- You got game?
- A little.
ALL: Yes!
Hey, pitcher. Ball.
Chad: All right! Let's hustle!
Come on! Wildcats!
ALL: Get your head in the game!
Hey! Oh! Play ball.
Hey, hey!
Hey, batter batter, hey, batter batter
Swing
I've got to just do my thing.
Hey, batter batter, hey, batter batter
Swing.
Yeah
I'll show you that it's one and the same
Baseball, dancing, same game.
It's easy
Step up to the plate, start swinging
I want to play ball now and that's all.
This is what I do
it ain't no dance that you can show me.
Hey, hey, hey.
- Yeah.
- You'll never know.
- Oh, I know.
- If you never try.
There's just one little thing
that stops me every time.
- Yeah.
- Come on!
- I don't dance.
- I know you can.
- Not a chance.
- No
- if I can do this, well, you can do that.
- But I don't dance.
- Hit it out of the park.
- I don't dance.
- I say you can.
- There's not a chance.
- Oh.
- Slide home, you score.
Swinging on the dance floor
I don't dance, no.
Hey, batter batter, hey, batter batter
Swing
I've got to just do my thing.
Hey, batter batter, hey, batter batter
Swing.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Two stepping, now you're up to bat
Bases loaded, do your dance.
It's easy, take your best shot
Just hit it
I've got what it takes playing my game.
So, you better spin that pitch
you're gonna throw me.
- Yeah.
- I'll show you how I swing.
- You'll never know.
- Oh, I know.
If you never try.
There's just one little thing.
- That stops me every time.
- Yeah, come on.
- I don't dance.
- I know you can.
- Not a chance.
- No, no.
If I can do this
Well, you can do that.
- But I don't dance.
- Hit it out of the park.
- I don't dance.
- I say you can.
There's not a chance
Oh no.
Slide home, you score
Swingin' on the dance floor
I don't dance no.
Lean back, tuck it in, take a chance.
Swing it out, spin around
do the dance
I wanna play ball not dance hall
I'm makin' a triple not a curtain call
I can prove it to you
till you know it's true.
'Cause I can swing it
I can bring it to the diamond too.
You're talkin' a lot
Show me what you got.
Stop
Swing.
Hey
Swing it like this.
Yeah oh.
- Swing.
- Come on.
- Jitterbug.
- Just like that oh.
That's what I mean
That's how you swing.
You make a good pitch
but I don't believe.
- I say you can.
- I know I can't
I don't dance.
You can do it
I don't dance, no.
Nothin' to it
Atta boy, Atta boy, yeah.
Hey, batter batter, hey, batter batter

One, two, three, four
Everybody, swing, come on.

But I don't dance.
Hit it out of the park.

There's not a chance
No, no.
If I can do this
Well, you can do that.
But I don't dance.
Hit it out of the park.

- I know you can.
Not a chance
No, no.
If I can do this
Well, you can do that.
But I don't dance.
Hit it out of the park.
- I don't dance.
- I say you can.
- There's not a chance.
- Oh.
Slide home, you score
Swinging on the dance floor
I don't dance, no.
Safe!
That's it!
It's okay!
Hey, Evans.
I'm not saying
I'm going to dance in the show,
but if I did,
what would you have me do?
PLAYER: Hey! Get back, get back!
Here we go, here we go!
Defense, hold him tight!
Oh, dang!
Mr. Evans: This kid's good.
I like what I'm seeing.
Troy gives 110, 24l7,
that you can count on.
Here we go!
- Game. Game.
- Good game!
Huh? Was I right?
Great.
All right,
so you call that a "little" game?
Little League. World Series.
Newport, Rhode Island.
Champions.
- Good job!
- Nice hat.
Gabriella: You're so awesome.
Ryan: Hey.
What can I say?
- Troy, you ready to run it back?
- Let's run it, man.
- All right. Let's go, yo.
- Let's go.
Let's go, yo, let's go. Let's run it back.
- Looking good.
- Wow, Wildcat!
- Too much?
- Only in daylight.
- Yeah.
- East High colors, very impressive.
- Hey. Be true to your school, right?
- Absolutely.
Everyone's excited
about doing the show.
Hey, I know everyone thinks
that I'm Sharpay's poodle,
- but I really think that I could...
- Hey.
If they were thinking that,
they're not thinking that today.
How do you do that swing-step
you did last night?
That's easy.
Hey.
- Hey.
- Hey.
So, I called last night.
I got hung up at the gym.
Hey, my dad says you're doing great
with those college guys.
Oh. Yeah. They're awesome.
Playing with them is like being
in another world.
Well, you missed out on a fun night.
It was a great game.
But the dessert afterwards
had to be the best part.
Her mom makes the best brownies
- in the entire world.
- Yeah, I know. I've had them.
Well, I'll see you guys later.
Hey, LeBron,
how'd it go with the Redhawks?
You know, they're very tall.
We got Vince from maintenance
to play, so it worked out.
- In case you were wondering.
- Maybe we could play later today.
I don't know. Check with Vince.
Well, Mr. Evans set up the workout,
not me.
Did you even ask to include us,
Captain?
I didn't go looking for the Redhawks,
the Redhawks came to me. Okay?
I didn't sign up for this golf job,
Fulton offered it. I said yes.
My decision. But I show up to work
same as you, so chill, man.
You get a speck of dirt on your pants,
- and someone dry cleans you.
- And you wouldn't do the same thing...
- if I was as good as you?
- I did not say that.
- You didn't have to!
- And neither did you!
You know what? We didn't vote you
captain because of your jump shot.
Okay, we did it because you're the guy
who usually knows what's up.
- But I guess things change.
- You think you got me all figured out?
Well, I don't think so.
And I don't answer to you.
Then maybe you should
start answering to yourself!
Look, we have been like brothers
since pre-school.
If I don't know who you are these days,
then who does?
Excuse me. You're all being paid
to work, not play Dr. Phil. Chop-chop.
Table settings, nice. Oh. No, no.
No. No. No. Now, that? Fabulous.
Troy!
Daddy will make certain the entire
scholarship committee is right here.
Perfect view.
I've already spoken to your mother.
They're going to be sitting at a table
right next to ours.
It's going to be a fabulous evening.
- Come on.
- Great.
SHARPAY: Rehearsal, everyone!
- Taylor, I'm signing off on everything.
- Fabulous!
Taylor: Thank you, Mrs. Evans.
Mrs. Evans: Good job.
Look, Sharpay. I know I promised
I'd do this, but just take it easy on me.
I'm kind of new
to the whole performing thing.
Five, six, seven, eight!
You are the music in.
You are the music in
Are the music in.
You know the words
"Once upon a time"
Makes you listen, there's a reason.
And when you dream
there's a chance you'll find.
A little laughter, or happy ever after.
You're harmony to the melody.
That's echoing inside my head.
A single voice.
Above the noise.
Like a common thread
Sing it to me.
When I hear my favorite song
I know we belong.
'Cause you are the music in me.
It's living in all of us.
It's here
Because you are the music in me.
You are the music in.
You are the music in
Are the music in
Harmony to the melody.
Echoing inside my head.
When I hear my favorite song
I know we belong.
'Cause you are the music in me.
It's living in all of us.
It's here
Because you are the music in.
Me, me, me, me, me.
You are the music in.
You are the music in me.
Yeah, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Great job! One second.
Great rehearsal!
Everybody break!
You know, Troy,
I've always known you were special.
And it's pretty obvious I'm special, too.
I think we were meant to sing together,
don't you?
I need some air.
Don't be long!
We're going to run it again!
Show me what you got!
Come on, everybody! Here we go!
You're up! You're up! You're up first!
Here we go! Give it to me!
Come on! Oh, yeah!
You got it! Here we go!
Pass it to me!
Come on, let's dance!
You're up! You're up!
Let's show them what we got!
Come on! All right!
Ryan: Oh, cut that! Get out of here!
- You got it! Hey.
- Good job!
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
I said keep an eye on them,
not turn them into the cast of Grease!
Pretty cool, huh?
Do you want us to lose the Star Dazzle
Award to a bunch of dishwashers?
Us? Well, I guess that's showbiz.
When did you become one of them?
You know,
I'll take that as a compliment.
But you and Troy
have a good show, sis.
Oh, we plan to.
Give me a beat.
The Midsummer's Night Talent Show
means something to me,
- and to my family.
- Well...
Those Wildcats will turn it into a farce.
I'm... Your brother is one of
"those Wildcats," I'm told.
Oh, don't you mention that traitor to us.
Employee involvement in the show
is a tradition here.
Traditions change. My parents have
important guests coming.
We'll need every employee working
the party, and not on stage.
Pardon moi, but
we're not just talking about employees,
we're talking about your classmates.
You might want to think this one out.
All right.
Done. Now do it.
- Hi, Taylor.
- Hi.
Distribute these in the staff area,
but not until the end of shift.
- What? Wait! Mr. Fulton...
- No discussion, Miss McKessie.
This is a business.
Welcome to the world of adults
who wish to keep their jobs because
they have mortgages they wish to pay,
tuition bills, car payments,
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
So, sometimes, we have
to perform tasks, however unpleasant,
that are necessary
for that all-too-important paycheck
to land in our all-too-empty pockets!
- May I get you a cup of tea, Mr. Fulton?
- Chamomile would be lovely.
- Go, Martha! Go, Martha!
- Go, Martha! Go, Martha!
May I have your attention, please?
You guys,
I need to make an announcement.
All junior staffers will be required
to work on show night.
- What?
- Yeah, it says,
"No staff participation in the show
will be allowed. No exceptions."
KELSI: No show?
Taylor: There's a show.
We're just not in it.
That's great.
I'm sorry, you guys. There's nothing
we can do about it. It's Fulton's orders.
There's no way this is Fulton's idea.
Unless Fulton suddenly has blonde
hair and wears designer flip-flops.
Excuse me.
- Totally!
- Sharpay!
Forget about the rest of us,
how about the fact
that your brother has worked
extremely hard on this show?
Oh, boo-hoo. He'll be in the show.
He'll do his celebrity impersonations.
And don't lecture me about Ryan,
given the way you've been interfering
with Troy's future.
What?
You've gotten him written up by Fulton
for sneaking on the golf course,
swimming after hours.
I had to step in just to save Troy's job.
I'm not interested in what you think
you're doing for Troy.
That's between you and him.
But you're messing with my friends,
my summer,
and that's not okay with me.
You don't like the fact that I won.
What's the prize? Troy?
The Star Dazzle Award?
You have to go through all of this
just to get either one?
No, thanks, Sharpay.
You're very good at a game
that I don't want to play,
so I'm done here.
But you better step away
from the mirror
long enough to check the damage
that will always be right behind you.
Girls!
Hey.
What do you mean you're done here?
I mean, you can't quit.
Us working together sounded good,
but plans change and people change.
The club talent show is a big deal
for Sharpay,
and evidently for your future,
so it's cool.
Just make it happen.
- Wear your new Italian shoes.
- Hey, I'm still me.
Blowing off your friends,
missing dates?
- If that's you, it's good to know.
- No, no, no, no, no.
I was only doing that because
I'm working on the scholarship thing.
You know that.
But if along the way
you act like someone you're not,
pretty soon that's who you become.
I meant what I said about movies
and summer and just being together.
I'm sure you did, at the time.
But I also meant what I said,
that I want to remember this summer.
But not like this, Troy.
I gotta say
what's on my mind.
Something about us
doesn't seem right these days.
Life keeps getting in the way.
Whenever we try.
Somehow the plan
is always rearranged.
It's so hard to say
But I gotta do what's best for me.
You'll be okay
I've got to move on and be who I am
I just don't belong here
I hope you understand.
We might find a place
in this world someday.
But at least for now
I gotta go my own way.
Don't wanna leave it all behind.
But I get my hopes up.
And I watch them fall every time.
Another color turns to gray.
And it's just too hard to watch it all
Slowly fade away
I'm leaving today
'Cause I gotta do what's best for me.
You'll be okay
I've got to move on and be who I am
I just don't belong here
I hope you understand.
We might find our place
in this world someday.
But at least for now
I gotta go my own way.
What about us?
What about everything
we've been through?
What about trust?
You know I never wanted to hurt you.
What about me?
What am I supposed to do?
- I gotta leave, but I'll miss you.
- I'll miss you.
Oh, so
I've got to move on and be who I am.
Why do you have to go?
I just don't belong here
I hope you understand
I'm trying to understand.
We might find a place
in this world someday.
- But at least for now.
- I want you to stay
I gotta go my own way
I've got to move on and be who I am.
What about us?
I just don't belong here
I hope you understand
I'm trying to understand.
We might find our place
in this world someday.
But at least for now
I gotta go my own way
I gotta go my own way
I gotta go my own way.
You're usually taking these
right off the grill.
Maybe I've been eating too much
at the club.
You've barely been out of this room
the last three or four days.
- Let's call the guys, get a game going.
- They wouldn't come even if I called.
I find that hard to believe.
Dad, do I seem different
to you this summer?
You dress a lot better, that's for sure.
Oh, man, I'm serious.
Maybe my friends are right,
maybe I'm turning into a jerk
with new shoes.
New shoes, not a new kid.
Where's this coming from?
I've been so focused on my future.
I mean, Gabriella quit.
Chad won't talk to me.
I don't see the Wildcats
running around here.
Is this about going after
what you want?
Yeah, Dad.
The scholarship's important. I get it.
Hey, hey.
Look, it's only a big deal
if it makes sense to you.
I don't even know who I am anymore.
You know what?
I've known this kid for a long, long time.
And I got a lot of faith in him.
He looks a lot like you.
I'm absolutely sure he's going
to figure out the right thing to do.
It's so good. I cannot wait.
BO Y: Yeah,
I'm eating so much breakfast,
I won't be able to eat my dinner
at night.
KELSI: Oh, yeah.
It's okay, Ryan's gonna help.
- I don't know.
- We'll get it eventually.
Excuse me.
Everybody's always talking at me.
Everybody's trying to get in my head
I wanna listen to my own heart talking
I need to count on myself instead.
- Did you ever.
- Lose yourself to get what you want?
- Did you ever.
- Get on a ride then wanna get off?
Did you ever.
Push away the ones
you should've held close?
Did you ever let go?
Did you ever not know?
I'm not gonna stop, that's who I am
I'll give it all I got, that is my plan.
Will I find what I lost?
You know you can.
Bet on it, bet on it, bet on it, bet on it.
Bet on me
I wanna make it right, that is the way.
To turn my life around
Today is the day.
Am I the type of guy
who means what I say?
Bet on it, bet on it, bet on it, bet on it.
How will I know
if there's a path worth taking?
Should I question every move I make?
With all I've lost, my heart is breaking
I don't want to make
the same mistakes.
Did you ever.
Doubt your dream will ever come true?
Did you ever.
Blame the world but never blame you?
- I will never.
- Try to live a lie again
I don't wanna win this game
if I can't play it my way
I'm not gonna stop, that's who I am
I'll give it all I got, that is my plan.
Will I find what I lost?
You know you can.
Bet on it, bet on it, bet on it, bet on it
I wanna make it right, that is the way.
To turn my life around
Today is the day.
Am I the type of guy
who means what I say?
Bet on it, bet on it, bet on it, bet on it.
Oh, hold up.
Gimme room to think
Bring it on down.
Gotta work on my swing
Gotta do my own thing.
Hold up.
It's no good at all to see yourself.
And not recognize your face.
Out on my own
it's such a scary place.
The answers are all inside of me.
All I got to do is believe
I'm not gonna stop, not gonna stop
till I get my shot.
That's who I am, that is my plan
We'll end up on top.
You can bet on it, bet on it
bet on it, bet on.
You can bet on it, bet on it, bet on it
Bet on me
I wanna make it right, that is the way.
To turn my life around
Today is the day.
Am I the type of guy
who means what I say?
Bet on it, bet on it, bet on it
You can bet on me.
This way.
What do you mean
you're not doing the show?
- Exactly that.
- We're singing a duet, Troy!
A duet means two people.
Well, mostly me in this case,
but whatever! Duet!
I'm an employee.
Employees aren't allowed in the show.
No, no, no, no. No, no.
You're an honorary member.
Not anymore.
- I asked Fulton for my kitchen job back.
- What?
Sharpay, I don't like the way
you've been treating my friends.
And I don't like the way
I've been treating them either,
so I'm doing something about it.
An entire table of University boosters
are coming to see you, thanks to me.
So, I'll be their waiter.
They'll be thrilled.
Troy, Troy. This could change your life!
I'm more interested in
about what my friends think of me,
and what I think of myself.
Oh, we could all hold hands
around the campfire some other time!
Right now we've got a show to do.
No. You've got a show to do.
I got a kitchen to clean.
It's okay.
Kelsi, find Ryan.
Taylor: Welcome this evening.
You'll be seated at table 21.
Kelly, will you escort them, please?
Excellent.
Ladies, you look gorgeous
- this evening. Beautiful.
- FULTON: And now, returning with
a abridged version
of last year's tap-dancing epic,
Tina and her Tippety-Tappity Toes!
There you are! Thank goodness
you've come to your senses.
Plug in the volcano.
Humu Humu is back on.
Enjoy your pineapple on your own, sis.
I'm not doing the show.
What? Oh, put some fresh batteries
in your Tiki Warrior costume
- and let's get going!
- Took your advice. Sold it online.
You've always wanted the spotlight.
Now you've got it. Break a leg.
The curtain's up. Showtime!
Kelsi told us what went down
between you and Sharpay.
I'm more interested in what went down
between me and you, man.
- I was a jerk.
- Yeah.
But, hey, brothers fight.
And they're still brothers.
All right!
Guys, I messed up your show
and I'm sorry.
Yeah, because show business
is our entire lives, right?
Hey, I hope you haven't permanently
filled my spot in the two-on-two game.
And, Ryan, I know how hard
you must've worked on this show.
Making these Wildcats look good
couldn't have been easy.
- Hey.
- So, I apologize.
Hey, the truth is,
we've all had a lot of fun.
At least, I have.
Hey, you gotta see
this dude play baseball.
I'm looking forward to it.
- All right!
- Yeah!
Troy, listen, all these people out there,
I don't really want
to see my sister crash and burn.
At least, I think I don't.
I think you should sing with her.
My life is over. I've been a good girl.
I've never lied, except when necessary.
I always bought my parents
expensive gifts,
using their credit card, of course.
But I don't deserve this humiliation!
You need to get out there.
Mrs. Hoffenfeffer and her sock puppet
are stinking up the premises.
Well, the only thing that
would make it any lovelier would be
that if I won that Star Dazzle Award!
Sharpay, I'm going to find you.
That award, I tell you, it's mine!
Mine! Mine!
Mirror, mirror on the wall. Who's the...
Oh, forget it.
How's your show going?
How's it going?
My show makes the captain
of the Titanic
look like he won the lottery.
- I'll sing with you, Sharpay.
- What?
I promised. And I keep my promises.
But what was the first thing you said
to me when I started working here?
- Bring me more iced tea?
- Think harder. We're...
- All in this together.
- Exactly.
Well, we are.
So, let's get out there
and knock them dead, Troy Bolton!
I do the show
if the Wildcats do the show.
And I'd think fast.
I just sort of wish
you were doing this for me.
You're a good guy, Troy.
And actually, right now, I think
I like you better than I like myself.
Did I just say that?
SHARPAY: Girls! Places!
- Okay. Everyone. Ryan, the show's on.
- Where's the music? Where's Troy?
Talked to Sharpay, everything's cool.
Hey, speaking of my sister,
she wants you to learn a new song.
Everyday. I can't learn a new song!
- Kelsi will help you with it.
- What?
- It's showtime!
- Yeah!
Chad: What team?
ALL: Wildcats!
- What team?
- Wildcats!
- What team?
- Wildcats!
Once in a lifetime.
And now it's time for our five-time.
Star Dazzle Award winner,
Miss Sharpay Evans,
singing this year with
our assistant golf pro, Mr. Troy Bolton.
Where is Troy?
- Hey. Why did you switch songs?
- Switch songs? What?
- Yeah, Ryan said...
- FULTON: Bolton!
- But I didn't learn a new song.
- Exactly.
Girls!
Once in a lifetime.
Means there's no second chance.
So I believe that you and me.
Should grab it while we can.
Gabriella: Make it last forever.
And never give it back.
It's our turn
and I'm loving where we're at.
BOTH: Because this moment's really
all we have.
Every day of our lives.
Wanna find you there
Wanna hold on tight.
Gonna run.
While we're young
And keep the faith.
Every day.
From right now.
Gonna use our voices
and scream out loud.
Take my hand.
Together we will celebrate.
Celebrate.
Oh, every day
They say that you should follow.
And chase down what you dream.
But if you get lost and lose yourself.
What does it really mean?
No matter where we're going.
Oh, yeah, it starts from where we are.
There's more to life.
When we listen to our hearts.
And because of you
I've got the strength to start.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Every day of our lives.
Wanna find you there
Wanna hold on tight.
Gonna run.
While we're young
And keep the faith.
Oh, every day.
From right now.
Gonna use our voices
and scream out loud.
Take my hand.
Together we will celebrate.
Oh, every day.
We're taking it back
We're doing it here together.
It's better like that
And stronger now than ever.
We're not gonna lose.
'Cause we get to choose
That's how it's gonna be.
Every day of our lives.
Wanna find you there
Wanna hold on tight.
Gonna run.
While we're young
And keep the faith.
Keep the faith.
Every day of our lives.
Wanna find you there
Wanna hold on tight.
Gonna run.
While we're young
And keep the faith.
Oh, yeah.
- Every day.
- Every day.
From right now.
Gonna use our voices
and scream out loud.
- Take my hand.
- Take my hand.
Together we will celebrate.
- Every day.
- Oh, every day.
Oh, oh, every day.
Oh, every day.
Every day.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- I'm singing every day.
Every day.
Every day.
Every day.
Every day.
Every day.
Every day.
Yeah.
Just fabulous! Fabulous!
Well. If you'll all
please take your seats.
I have one last task
to perform this evening.
The Star Dazzle for this year goes to,
of course, our one and only...
My brother, Ryan Evans!
That's our boy!
Fix the hat.
Gabriella:  Yeah.
You are the music in me.
You know the words
"Once upon a time"
Make you listen
there's a reason.
When you dream
There's a chance you'll find.
A little laughter, or happy ever after.
Gabriella AND Troy:
You're harmony to the melody.
That's echoing inside my head.
A single voice above the noise.
- Here's to the future.
- No. Here's to right now.
And like a common thread.
You're pulling me.
When I hear my favorite song
I know that we belong.
Oh, you are the music in me.
Yeah, it's living in all of us.
And it's brought us here because.
- Because you are the music in me.
- Because you are the music in me.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You are the music in me.
When I hear my favorite song
I know that we belong.
You are the music in me.
It's living in all of us.
And it's brought us here because.
You are the music in me.
You are the music in me.
Chad:  One, two, three, four.
The summer that we wanted.
Yeah, we've finally got it.
Now's the time we get to share.
Each day we'll be together.
Now until forever.
So everybody everywhere.
Let's take it to the beach
Take it there together.
Let's celebrate today
'Cause there'll never be another.
We're stronger this time
We've been there for each other.
Everything's just right.
Everybody, all for one.
Our real summer has just begun.
Let's rock and roll, and just let go.
Feel the rhythm of the drums.
We're gonna have fun in the sun.
Now that all the hard work
Work is done.
Everybody one for all
And all for one.
- All for one.
- All for one, one.
Summertime together.
Now we're even closer.
That's the way it's meant to be.
Oh, we're just getting started.
Come and join the party.
You deserve it same as me.
Let's take it to the beach
Take it there together.
Let's celebrate today
'Cause there'll never be another.
We're stronger this time
We've been there for each other.
Everything's just right.
Everybody, all for one.
Our real summer has just begun.
Let's rock and roll, and just let go.
Feel the rhythm of the drums.
We're gonna have fun in the sun.
Now that all the hard work

Everybody up.
Everybody rock it.
Take it from the top.
And never ever stop it.
It's not about the future.
It's not about the past.
It's making every single day
Last and last and last.
Fun and sun
What could be better?
Let's have fun
Everyone together now.
Everybody, everybody now.
This is where our summer
really begins.
The very last time
it's ever gonna be like this.
It's a party you don't wanna miss.
Guys, show them
we can make some moves, hey.
Girls, show them
we know how to groove, oh.
- Here.
- And now.
- Let's turn the party.
- Out.
Everybody jump in.
Everybody, all for one.
Our real summer has just begun.
Let's rock and roll, and just let go.
Feel the rhythm of the drums.
We're gonna have fun in the sun.
Now that all the hard work
Work is done.
Everybody one for all.
Everybody, all for one.

Feel the rhythm of the drums.
We're gonna have fun in the sun.
Now that all the hard work
Work is done.
Come on, everyone, let's dance.
We can't let the moment pass.
Let's make the party last.
All for one.
All for one
Yeah!
Coral blue!
It's totally like your skin tone.
And mine, too! We are majorly
skin-tone compatible, Troy.
My daughter.
Then maybe you should
start answering to yourself!
By the end of summer,
you'll have me playing like a pro.
Oops.
If we live that long.
For you.
MAN: Cut!
Troy!
- Put it in forward.
- It is!
