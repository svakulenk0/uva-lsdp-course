Subtitles by Ruthless
Waking up begins with saying
''am'' and ''now''.
Jennifer, I'm not gonna tell you again.
For the past eight months waking
up has actually hurt.
The cold realization that
I'm still here slowly sets in.
I was never teribly fond of waking up.
I was never one to jump out of bed and
greet the day with a smile like Jim was.
I used to want to punch him sometimes
in the morning he was so happy.
I always used to tell him that only fools
greet the day with a smile...
...that only fools possibly
escape the simple truth.
That now isn't simply now.
It's a cold reminder.
One day later than yesterday.
One year later than last year.
And that sooner or later it will come.
He used to laugh at me and then
give me kiss on the cheek.
It takes time in the morning
for me to become George.
The time to adjust to what is expected
of George and how he is to behave.
By the time I have dressed and
put the final layer of polish...
...on the now slightly stiff
but quite perfect George...
...I know fully what part
I'm supposed to play
Looking in the mirror staring back at me
isn't so much as a face...
...as the expression of a predicament.
Just get through the goddamn day.
A bit melodramatic, I guess.
But then again...
...my heart has been broken.
I feel as if I am sinking, drowning...
...can't breathe.
Aren't you going to say something?
Are you kidding? It's spectacular.
What are you doing?
Just stop it.
Stop it.
I don't think that you're quite
ready for life in a glass house.
Drapes, old man.
You're the one who is always saying
that we are invisible.
That's not exactly what I meant.
For the first time in my life
I can't see my future.
Every day goes by in a haze.
But today I have decided
will be different.
Finally. You know it's been
raining here all day.
I've been trapped in this house
waiting for you to call.
I'm sorry, I must have the wrong number.
I'm calling for Mr. George Falconer.
I'm sorry, I was expecting someone else.
Yes sir, you have indeed called the...
...correct number. How may I help you?
- This is Harold Ackerley.
I'm Jim's cousin.
Of course.
Yes, good evening Mr. Ackerley.
I'm afraid I'm calling with
some bad news.
There has been a car accident.
An accident?
There has been a lot of snow here
lately and the roads have been icy.
On his way into town,
Jim lost control of his car.
It was instantaneous apparently.
It happened late yesterday, but his
parents didn’t want to call you.
I see.
In fact, they don't that
I'm calling you now.
But I thought that you should know.
Thank you.
I know this must be quite a shock.
It was for all of us.
Yes, indeed.
- Will there be a service?
- The day after tomorrow.
Well, I suppose I should
get off the phone...
...and book a plane flight.
The service is just for family.
For family, of course.
Well, thank you for calling.
- Mr. Ackerley?
- Yes?
- May I ask what happened to the dogs?
- Dogs?
There was a dog with him but he died.
Was there another one?
Yes, there was a small female.
I don't know, I'm sorry.
I haven't heard anyone
mentioning another dog.
- Well, thank you for calling Mr. Ackerley.
- Goodbye, Mr. Falconer.
Hello, Charley.
How did you know it was me?
Charlotte, nobody else calls me
before eight in the morning.
I didn't call too early, did I?
You sound grumpy.
No, I have a headache.
Listen, I was going to call you actually.
Is too late to change my mind about tonight.
No, of course not.
I haven't seen you all week.
- I'm dying for a dose of you.
- I know, I'm sorry.
So great, I'll see you tonight.
I have to run.
I'm late for the work.
I'll call you later from school.
Alright, I see you then.
- Bye, kiddo.
- Bye, old man.
Good morning, Mr. George.
Sir, you don't look so good today.
Good morning, Alva.
No, I didn't sleep very well.
You forgot to take the bread
out of the freezer this morning.
It stays fresh that way.
It was a little too fresh this morning.
There are some papers
laid out on my desk...
...which need to stay there.
Please don't move them.
- I'm afraid my pen leaked all over the bed.
- It's okay, sir.
- Alva?
- Yes, sir?
Thank you, you're a wonderful.
This government, as promised,
has maintained the closest surveillance...
...of the Soviet military buildup
on the Island of Cuba.
- Professor Falconer?
- Yes?
There was a student here this
morning asking for your address.
My address?
- Did you give it to him?
- Yes, sir.
I did.
I hope that's okay.
I realize that I probably shouldn't
have but he was very nice.
Before I knew it he...
Your hair looks great up like that.
I really fits suits you.
You always look so beautiful...
...really fresh...
You have such a lovely smile.
- Arpège?
- Sir?
Really beautiful.
- Good morning, Don.
- Good morning, George.
Good morning, George.
Good morning, Grant.
You look awful.
What have you been doing?
Look around you, Grant.
Most of these students aspire to
nothing more than corporate job...
...and a desire to raise coke-drinking,
TV-watching children...
...who as soon as they can
speak start chanting TV jingles...
...and smashing things with hammers.
- You're really scaring me today, George.
Don't tell me. You have
easy time with these students.
I found them staring at me
in a kind of bovine stupor...
...as if I were lecturing in
a foreign language.
Remind me why we shouldn't
all just be annihilated.
You seem to think this is all a joke.
We're living in a world where
nuclear war is a real threat.
I don't understand how
that doesn't concern you.
You're serious, aren't you?
Yes, I'm serious.
George did you even read the article
I gave you on bomb shelters?
Our is almost done. We had 3
contractors work on it...
...so none of them know what we've got.
I'm having the outside of it landscaped
so no one will that it's there.
Really?
If word gets out that
you've got a better shelter...
...then everyone will try to get in
when something happens.
So?
There will be no time for sentiment
when the Russians fire a missile at us.
If it's going to be a world with
no time for sentiment Grant...
...the it's not a world
that I want to live in.
After Many a Summer Dies the Swan.
I think you've all...
...read the Huxley novel I assigned
more than three weeks ago?
How does the title relate to our story?
- Yes, Mr. Mong.
- It doesn't.
It's about a rich guy who's too
afraid that he's too old for this girl...
...and thinks that a young guy...
Russ.
Russ?
Yes, Mr. Hirsch.
Sir, on page 79, Mr. Propter says that...
...the stupidest text in the Bible is
“they hated me without a cause.”
Does that mean the Nazis were
right to hate the Jews?
- Is Huxley an anti-Semite?
- No.
No, Mr. Huxley is not an anti-Semite.
Of course, the Nazis were
wrong to hate the Jews.
But their hating the Jews
was not without a cause.
It's just that the cause wasn't real.
The cause was imagined.
The cause was fear.
Let's leave the Jews out o
this just for a moment.
Let's think of another minority.
One that...
One that can go unnoticed if it needs to.
There are all sorts of minorities,
blondes for example...
...or people with freckles.
But a minority is only
thought of as one...
...when it constitutes some kind of
threat to the majority.
A real threat or an imagined one.
And therein lies the fear.
If the minority is somehow invisible...
...and the fear is much greater.
That fear is why the
minority is persecuted.
So, you see there always is a cause.
The cause is fear.
Minorities are just people.
People like us.
I can see that I've lost you a bit.
So tell you what? We're gonna
forget about Mr. Huxley today...
...and we're gonna talk about fear.
Fear, after all, is our real enemy.
Fear is taking over our world.
Fear is being used as a tool of
manipulation in our society.
It's how politicians peddle policy.
It's how Madison Avenue sells us
things that we don't need.
Think about it.
Fear of being attacked.
Fear of that there are communists
lurking around every corner.
Fear of that some little
Caribbean country...
...that doesn't believe in our way
of life poses a threat to us.
Fear that black culture
may take over the world.
Fear of Elvis Presley's hips.
Actually, maybe that one is a real fear.
Fear that our bad breath
might ruin our friendships.
Fear of growing old and being alone.
The of that we're useless and that
no one cares what we have to say.
Have a good weekend.
Sir! May I talk to you for a minute?
Why don't you always
talk to us like that?
I don't think it went over very well.
Man, fear of things gets
to me all the time.
But you can't talk about it with
anyone or you just sound like a fool.
- You can't even talk about it with Lois?
- I don't think she's afraid of anything.
Everyone's afraid of something, Kenny.
What are you afraid of, sir?
Cars.
How can you live in Los Angeles
and be afraid of cars?
Maybe you can't.
Sometimes my fear of things
can almost paralyze me.
It's like I get really panic stricken and
I feel like I might explode or something.
- May I ask you a personal question, sir?
- If you like.
Do you ever get high?
- How old do I look to you?
- Have you ever taken any drugs?
Of course, Kenny.
Like what?
I don't feel I should be discussing this
with you on campus Mr. Potter.
It's the only way I get by sometimes.
- Have you ever tried mescaline?
- Not my drug of choice.
I shaved off one of my eyebrows once
on mescaline. Not a good look for me.
- Sir?
- I looked in the mirror.
Big mistake if you're high on mescaline.
I decided that my eyebrows
were taking over my face.
Before I knew it, I had shaved one off.
I wore a band-aid over my eye for about
six weeks while my brow grew back.
Very embarrassing.
- You didn't take it again after that?
- Kenny, have you been listening to me?
I shaved off my eyebrow.
I wanted an experience Mr. Potter,
not a career on stage.
If you ever want to get high sir,
I usually have some dope.
You're really mad aren't you?
I'm sorry, sir. I guess you don't feel
very comfortable talking like this.
What makes you say that?
Lois thinks you're kind of cagey.
Like this morning...
...when you were listening to all that
crap we were talking about Huxley.
Well, not all of you.
I didn't notice you open
your mouth once.
I was watching you.
You let us ramble on and on
and then you straighten us out.
But you never really tell us
everything you know about something.
Well, maybe that's true up to a point.
It's not that I want to be cagey.
It's just that I can't really discuss
things completely openly...
...at school.
Someone would misunderstand.
I tried that today.
It didn't really work out.
What was it you wanted to get, sir?
Nothing. I was on my way
to the dean's office.
You mean you walked all the way
down here just to talk to me?
- Why not?
- Well...
I think you deserve
something for that, sir.
Here sir, take your pick.
- It's on me.
- Thank you.
I thought you'd probably pick blue.
- Why blue?
- Isn't blue supposed to be spiritual?
What makes you think I'm spiritual?
And you? Red?
- What is red stand for?
- A lot of things.
Rage, lust.
No kidding?
Well sir, I...
I guess I see you around.
Hello?
What are you up to, kiddo?
Just trying to finish up a book.
How's your day going?
Fine.
I was just leaving school and wanted to
know if you needed anything for tonight.
Thanks, you're sweet.
But I think I'm all set.
Be a darling and...
...pick up gin for me, Tangueray.
I love the color of the bottle.
You love what's in it.
What time do you want me?
Perfect. I'll see you then.
I'll see you then.
Bye, Geo.
Bye, kiddo.
Beautiful.
- Yes, Mr. Potter?
- Are you going somewhere, sir?
That is usually why people
get into their cars.
No, I mean are you going on
vacation or something?
- What?
- I saw you cleaning out your office.
What exactly is it that you want, Kenny?
I was just hoping that perhaps we could get
together for a drink or something sometime.
Why is that?
I don't know, sir.
Because I think you might like it.
And...
...because you seem as though
you could use a friend.
- Oh really?
- Yes, sir. You do.
They may be right.
It will have to be another time.
I'm late.
But thank you for the invitation.
And thank you for the talk earlier.
And stay away from the mescaline.
Hello, Mr. Falconer.
- Hello. How are you today?
- I'm fine, sir.
- Do you need to get into your box?
- Yes, I do.
Follow me.
Here you are, sir.
If you could please sign here...
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
So explain your friend Charlotte to me.
What would you like to know?
I don't know.
You seem very intimate I guess.
Like you were once
together or something.
- You haven't slept with her, have you?
- Yes.
And?
A few times when we were young.
I wouldn't say that it
meant nothing to me...
...but it certainly meant
a great deal more to Charley.
It was a long time ago in London.
I love Charley.
- And We were very close friends
but that's all. - Well, I'm confused.
If you sleep with women
then why are you with me?
Because I fall in love with men.
Because I fell in love with you.
Anyway, doesn't everyone sleep with
women when they're young?
- I haven't.
- You're joking.
No, I'm not.
It was just never anything
that interested me.
Well, you're awfully
modern aren't you?
You know, I think that was the first
thing that I noticed about you...
...was how sure of yourself you were.
How can you be so sure about
everything at your age?
You think I'm sure of myself?
Of course, you are.
I'm finished now.
Thank you.
Yes, Mr. Falconer?
Is there something else we
can help you with today?
I can't find my check book
and I need some cash.
Not my day I'm afraid.
Excuse me a minute.
Mommy says bushy eyebrows are pedestrian,
but I think yours are pretty.
I think yours are pretty too.
Why do you look so sad?
Would you like to meet Charlton Heston?
Ben Hur.
He's our scorpion.
Every night we throw in something
new to him and watch him kill it.
Daddy says it's like the colosseum. So my
brother Tom put on all the columns in here.
He wants to be a set designer.
He hasn't eaten the spider yet...
...cause he's still full from
the moth we gave him last night.
Daddy says he wants to throw
you in to the colosseum.
No kidding?
Why?
He says you're light in your loafers...
...but you aren't even wearing loafers.
I think my brother Tom is
light in his loafers too...
...but he wears Keds.
He made me do a hair conditioning
treatment on my hair with eggs.
Does it look shiny?
Sweetheart, what are you doing
bothering Mr. Falconer?
She's not bothering me at all Susan.
How are you?
I'm glad to see you George.
George, we're having a few people
over tonight for drinks...
...and would love to have you
join us if you could.
- Thank you. That's very kind of you but I
have plans. - Another time then.
Jennifer, let's let Mr. Falconer get
back to his banking.
Goodbye, George.
Bye, Susan.
Bye, Jennifer.
- May I help you, sir? - I'd like to buy
some bullets for this gun, please.
Yes, sir.
This is a really old gun, sir.
We have a two for one sale on
handguns at the moment.
- Perhaps one for the little lady?
- No thank you. Just the bullets, please.
- Here you go. Anything else?
- No, thank you.
That would be $2.29, sir.
Thank you.
I'm sorry. I hope she
didn't growl at you.
She goes a little crazy sometimes when
I have to leave her in the car.
She's perfect.
What's her name?
India.
Let's go there.
You little baby.
I used to have smooth fox terriers.
You don't see them very often.
The very smell of buttered toast.
She's still a puppy isn't she?
Well.
- Have a nice evening.
- You too.
Good night, India.
- I'm sorry about that.
- No, It's ok.
- It's my fault. I'll get you another pack.
- It's ok. Don't worry.
No, no I insist.
Thank you.
I'm sorry about the broken glass.
- Here you go.
- Thanks man.
You want one?
No, thanks.
Actually, yes.
Why not?
Thank you.
- Carlos.
- What did you say?
Carlos. You asked me my name.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm sorry.
You're really something.
You have an incredible face.
Enjoy that. It's a great gift.
Your Spanish is perfect.
Thank you.
I should have used it more.
Well...
It's not too late.
What are you doing?
Aren't we going somewhere?
No. But, thanks.
You know, it's the smog that
makes it that color.
I've never seen a sky like this before.
Sometimes awful things have
their own kind of beauty.
Could I have another cigarette?
Sure.
- Are sure that you don't want to go
for a drive? - I'm sure.
- Where are you from?
- Madrid.
Madrid?
How did you get here?
It's a long story.
I met a guy from LA at the
hotel where I worked...
...who told me I could live with him
and that he could get me an agent.
But he never realized that
I have a Spanish accent.
I like your accent.
You speak very well.
- How did you learn English? - My mom had
an American boyfriend when I was little.
Is your mother in Madrid?
Yes, she is.
She cuts hair.
She cut my hair before I left.
Do you like it?
- I thought it made me look like James Dean.
- You are better than James Dean.
Really?
Thanks.
No one has ever picked me up
and not wanted something.
I think you picked me up.
This is kind of a serious day for me.
Come on. What could be
so serious for a guy like you?
I'm just trying to get over
an old love I guess.
My mother says that
lovers are like buses.
You just have to wait a little while
and another one comes along.
I have to go.
You're a nice guy.
I hope you find...
...someone like you.
Thanks.
I'm going away.
It's your turn to change it.
Yeah, I'm not changing it.
It's your turn.
Besides, you never like
what I put on anyway.
I'll give you five dollars if you
change it. I'm too old to get up.
You're only old when it's
convenient for you to be old.
What are you reading anyway?
Oh God. Not that depressing crap again.
It's for my class.
What highbrow work of fiction
might you be reading?
Don't be so smug.
Man, what a life he has.
- Don't you just envy him?
- Why?
Because he can sniff
anyone's arse he wants?
Nice.
No, because he just does what he wants.
Like yesterday...
...I was standing in the front yard
and Susan came over to talk.
And that little brat of hers
Christopher came...
...running over waving that
damned gun of his around.
And our little dog walked
right up, hiked his leg...
...and peed all over Christopher's
new tennis shoes.
All over Christopher actually.
And of course, I had
to act like I was upset
It was so perfectly executed
you should have seen it.
After all the times those kids
have tortured that poor dog.
I mean, you should take a
lesson from him. They don't...
They don't stay up all night worrying.
They figured out how to get the two
of us to do exactly what they want.
They are basically very sophisticated
little parasites when you think about it.
Well, the dumbest creatures are the
happiest. Just look at your mother.
He's really just living the moment.
It's like now.
What could be better than
being tucked up here with you?
If I died right now it would be OK.
Well, it wouldn't be OK with me so why don't
you shut up and go change the record.
Good answer.
You know what? I was thinking
about taking them up...
...to Denver with me next week
if it's okay with you.
It's my mom.
She loves them.
Probably that recognition
of a similar mind.
You stay there, old man.
No, I did not forget the gin.
I'll see you in ten minutes.
Christopher, would you
like it if I killed you?
I don't know.
If you keep this up
we're going to find out.
So, why don't you go home
and stop shooting people?
I'm so happy to see you.
Come on in.
It smells wonderful.
I'm very hungry. Where is Lois?
I gave her the night off.
I'm cooking myself.
- You are?
- Yes, I'm trying something new.
- Charley darling, ''you cooking' is new.
- Don't be smart.
I'm in a good mood tonight.
I'm going to be fun.
I've already made two
New Year's resolutions.
Resolution one: No more talk
that of awful ex-husbands...
..and children who don't give a damn.
- And the other one?
- One what?
Resolution.
Resolution two: More smoking and more
drinking and screw it all! So come on...
...mix me up a drink.
I'll have a gin and tonic, please.
- And watch out baby!
- Coming up.
- It was sweet of you to come tonight.
- Sweet had nothing to do with it.
- I needed to see you.
- Come off it.
Whenever you do something sweet
you're too ashamed to admit it.
Here is to our early
New Year's resolutions.
Cheers.
What are your resolutions by the way?
To let go of the past completely,
entirely, and forever.
Light me up, will you?
Darling, you don’t look well.
Do you remember that little
heart attack you had last year?
- It wasn’t a heart attack.
- Well whatever it was darling...
...you don’t look so hot.
I’m fine.
I never felt better.
- I'm a little tired. I haven't
been sleeping... - Geo, it's normal.
You were with Jim for 16 years.
I think about Richard every day.
It’s hard being alone.
At least you have a job and a life.
Let’s have a bit of dinner shall we?
Because I’ve worked so very hard.
- What are you talking about? - Seriously,
there no such thing as old anymore.
The other day one of my students
has called me a senior citizen.
I wouldn't mind if old didn't exist...
...but I'm not sure senior is
what I'm aiming for either.
It's all becoming so bland.
It's not why I came to America.
It's like a complete breakdown
of culture and manners.
The young ones have no manners.
The other day at the car wash
a young man looked me up and down...
...and actually asked me if I
was a natural blonde.
- What did you say?
- I looked him straight in the eye...
...and said: ''Let's just say
if I stood on my head...
...I would be a natural
brunette with lovely breath.”
- You didn't!
- I did!
And the amusing thing was
that it went right over his head!
You know, you had a mouth on you
even back in London.
Do you remember that old lesbian
who threw her drink over your head...
...because you asked her if
she was hung like a donut.
Geo.
We could always go back to London.
The two of us.
- No, thanks.
- You know you miss it.
I miss it sometimes.
Maybe if Jim had lived.
He loved being in England. He asked us
to stay the last time we were there.
Do you really think you
would have moved?
I don't know. It's silly to even talk
about it. It was only a fantasy.
What's this?
It's my mother's wedding ring.
I found it a drawer
when I was cleaning out.
Charley my dear, you and I are
both in need of another drink.
Wait!
Wait, wait!
I love this!
- You're insane!
- Come on, old man!
Don't move.
Thank you.
- Very smooth cigarette move.
- I've always wanted to do that.
You don't even smoke.
Well, not for the last
sixteen years. Jim hated it.
What's to stop me now?
It's not as if he's gonna to kill me.
This is so nice, lying here with you.
Don't you ever miss this?
What we could have been to each other?
Having a real relationship and kids?
- I had Jim.
- I know, but I mean a real relationship.
Geo, let's be honest, what you and Jim
had together was wonderful but...
...wasn't it really just a
substitute for something else?
Is that really what you think
after all of these years?
You think Jim was just some
kind of substitute for real love?
Jim was not a substitute for anything.
Do you understand?
There is no substitute for Jim...
...anywhere!
And by the way, what is so real
about your relationship with Richard?
He left you after nine years!
Jim and I were together
for sixteen years!
And if he hadn't died we
would still be together!
What the hell is not real about that?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I know how much the two
of you loved each other.
I suppose I'm just jealous that
you and I never had that kind of love.
Actually, I've never had that
kind of love with anybody.
I don't think Richard ever loved me...
...except for the way I looked.
And Clay...
I don't know. You raise
a child and love it...
...and then when they are
old enough they just leave.
Charley, there is nothing
wrong with your life.
You just like feeling sorry for yourself.
It's one of your great pleasures.
And it's not one of yours?
You're as pathetic as I am.
Feeling sorry for myself is definitely
not one of my great pleasures.
Well, it's not one of mine either. I don't
like feeling sorry for myself one bit.
I tried to hold onto
Richard for so long...
...even when it was obvious to
everyone but me that it was over.
And now Clay is grown up.
I mean, what am I doing here Geo?
Tell me, what?
You have plenty of friends.
You'll be fine.
Yes, I have friends.
But none of them need me.
And yes I have you and if you weren't such a
goddamn poof we could have all been happy!
I only have you now
because you lost Jim.
Soon I'll lose you to someone else.
It's not as easy for a woman.
I've done everything the way
I was supposed to and...
...all I have to keep me
company is a bottle of gin.
Maybe you should try
donuts with your gin.
Screw you.
Charlotte, you are dramatic.
I swear you really almost had me.
A tiny tear was beginning to
form in the corner of my eye.
Now stop it.
You are still
breathtakingly beautiful.
When you can be bothered
to get up and out of bed...
...and you stop whimpering about
everything for five minutes.
Go to London.
Change your life.
If you're not happy being a woman
then stop acting like one.
You have all the answers.
No, I don't have any to mention.
If you're so smart why don't you
have something new in your life?
Take that position at Stanford.
You complain about that little school
but you could go anywhere you want.
I think what I've done
has been worthwhile.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said that.
As much as I dread it, I think
I will go back to London.
Why do you dread it?
When I lived in London last I was
young. I was fresh, I was everything.
Coming to America was such a dream,
it was the icing on the cake.
Going home is defeat.
None of it really worked
out the way I'd planned.
Most things don't work out
the way people plan.
You're just living in the past. You need
to start thinking about your future.
Living in the past is my future.
It doesn't have to be yours.
You're a man.
And you're a bore tonight.
Can't we just feel sorry for
ourselves a little bit longer?
Let's have another drink.
- I don't think so. I have to go. Come on.
Walk me out. - Please, please!
- Come on, I have to!
- No, this was such fun! No.
When will I see you again?
- Aren't you going to England?
- I'll never do that!
It's far too much effort.
Besides, I don't think Jim would want me
to leave you here in LA all alone.
Don't worry about me. I'll be fine.
I've got all the answers. Remember?
What are you doing this weekend?
I think I might just be very quiet.
You never really did take me
seriously, did you George?
I tried to Charley. Remember?
A long time ago.
It didn't really work out, did it?
No, Charley.
Sleep tight.
Patrick, a beer and a
packet of Lucky Strike, please.
Excuse me.
It's too hot in there.
Yes, it is.
- Would you like a cigarette?
- No thanks, I don't smoke.
- This place is really crowded.
- Well, it is Saturday night.
It's usually as bad as this.
People normally just stop by and pick
someone up and then head on down the beach.
Yeah. It's pretty wild out there.
I'm surprised the cops
don't break it up.
- Is it always like that?
- Since the war ended.
It's pretty great actually.
It's kind of pagan.
- I'm Jim.
- I'm George.
Pleased to meet you Jim.
I'm sorry, I'm supposed to meet some
friends but I can't find them.
I just needed to get out of the house
but the lure of a cold beer got to me.
Do you live hereby?
Canyon.
- For how long?
- Since 38.
- Where are you from?
- Colorado.
I really like it here.
It's close to beach.
I think I might stay after
I'm discharged.
I don't know, maybe
I'm a bit of a pagan.
- After you.
- No.
Sorry.
- Well, hello.
- Hi.
Do you buy me a drink?
I think I'm taken.
Too bad, too bad.
Do you want another beer?
Patrick, a bottle of scotch and
a pack of Lucky Strikes to go, please?
Patrick, cancel that.
Well, hello Mr. Potter.
Hello, sir.
- What are we drinking?
- Scotch.
Okay.
I come here all the time. I live just
around the corner, but then you knew that.
On Camphor Tree Lane.
You're still carrying that around.
One must always appreciate
life's little gifts.
So, what are you doing here?
- Just out for a ride on my bike.
- Is that all?
I don't know.
Were you looking for me?
Maybe. I don't know.
I feel like my head's
stopped up with stuff.
What kind of stuff?
Like, the stuff you were talking
about today in class.
That is definitely not important.
No, it is important.
Your class is great.
But somehow we always seem
to get stuck talking about the past.
The past just doesn't matter to me.
- The present?
- I can't wait for the present to be over.
It's a total drag.
Well, tonight is the exception.
What?
Tonight, yes!
The present, no!
Let's drink to tonight.
Tonight.
So if the past doesn't matter and
the present is a total drag.
What about the future?
What future?
Cuba might just blow us up.
Death is the future.
I'm sorry.
I don't mean to be depressing.
It's not depressing.
It's not depressing, it's true.
It may not be your immediate future
but it's what we all share.
Death is the future.
You're right, I guess.
If one is not enjoying one's present
there isn't a great deal to...
...suggest that the future
should be any better.
Yeah, I've thought that before.
But the thing is you just never know.
Look at tonight.
Actually...
...I feel really alone most of the time.
- You do?
- Yeah.
I've always felt this way.
I mean we're born alone, we die alone.
And while we're here we are absolutely,
completely sealed in our own bodies.
Really weird.
Kinda freaks me out to think about it.
We can only experience the outside world
through our own slanted perception of it.
Who knows what you're really like?
- I just see what I think you're like.
- I'm exactly what I appear to be.
If you look closely.
You know the only thing that has made
the whole thing worthwhile...
...has been those...
...few times that I've been able to really,
truly connect with another human being.
I had a hunch about you, sir.
- You did?
- Yes, sir.
I had a hunch you might
be a real romantic.
You know, everyone
keeps telling you that...
...when you're older, that you'll
have all this experience.
Like it's some great thing.
That's a load of shit.
I think I've actually just
gotten sillier and sillier.
- Really?
- Absolutely.
So, all your experience is useless.
No, I wouldn't say that.
As our friend Mr. Huxley says:
Experience is not what happens to a man.
It is what a man does
with what happens to him.
- Let's go swimming.
- Okay.
- What?
- It was a test.
I thought you were
bluffing about being silly so...
...I said to myself I'll suggest doing
something completely outrageous.
And if he resists, if he even hesitates
then I know he's full of shit.
Well, I wasn't.
Were you?
Hell, no!
Come on sir.
I'll help you down.
Let's go.
Come on, sir.
Sir?
Sir?
That's enough for now, sir.
- I'm fine.
- I'm cold. Come on.
Can we go back to your place, sir?
Of course.
Where else?
- Where else.
- Are you out of your mind?
- What's the matter?
- You can't get home like that!
We're invisible, don't you know that?
You know sir, they ought not
to let you out on your own.
You're liable to get into real trouble.
I excel at it.
Your forehead is bleeding.
The bathroom is just down the hall
if you would like to take a shower.
Aren't you taking a shower too, sir?
I'm fine. I'm English.
We like to be cold and wet.
First, I think that we need
to take care of that cut, sir.
Do you have any band-aids?
- Going camping, sir?
- I'm fine, really.
Stay there.
I'll be right back.
Sit up.
Tilt your head back.
Well sir, I'm afraid this
time you don't have...
...the excuse of mescaline
to explain your band-aid.
I think we should get you
out of those wet clothes.
Yes, sir.
- You're not too cold?
- I'm great.
- Would you like a drink?
- A beer, sir. If you have one.
I'm afraid that's all we have.
Two beers coming up.
- You live here all by yourself, sir?
- I do now.
I used to share this place with
a friend. He was an architect.
Man, guys my age dream about the
kind of setup you've got here.
I mean, what more can you want?
You get to be left alone and
come and go as you please.
Is that's your idea of the perfect life?
What's the matter, sir?
Don't you believe me?
If you're so keen on the
idea living by yourself...
...where does Lois fit into this plan?
Lois? What's she got to
do with anything?
I got the impression that you
and she were together.
Not really.
She is kind of cool and...
...we're good friends but...
I think what you really want to
ask me is if we sleep together.
- And do you?
- We did. Once.
- Why only once?
- I didn't say only once, I said once.
Come on, the last thing I want to
talk about right now is Lois.
What time is it?
My watch seems to have stopped.
Do you want me to go?
You must be kidding.
Go, get us another beer.
Is that an order, sir?
You're damn right it is.
Pathetic.
Did you say something, sir?
Why are you here?
Why did you get to the office and
ask secretary for my address?
I just wanted to see you
someplace other than school.
Why?
Sometimes I think I'm crazy cause I see
things so differently than everyone else.
I feel like I can talk to you.
To be honest sir, I was also
worried about you today.
Me?
What's to be worried about?
I'm fine.
I'm...
I'm fine.
A few times in my life I've had
moments of absolute clarity.
...as though it had all
just come into existence.
...and I realize that everything is
exactly the way it was meant to be.
