Do you, Angela Nardino,
take Dean Cumanno
as your lawfully wedded husband,
to love, honour and obey
till death do you part?
I do.
You happy, baby?
I'm so happy. It's beautiful, Dean.
It's everything I ever wanted.
Yeah?
Like the song says,
the best is yet to come.
The honeymoon!
Oh. You got a little bit of cake
right...
I think we've put in
enough of an appearance here.
Come on, let's go.
It's tradition for the best man
to dance with the beautiful bride.
- Piss off, Leo.
- You can't be rude to your friends.
I'd love to dance, Leo.
The best is yet to come
come the day you're mine.
Come fly with me
Let's fly, let's fly away
Just say the words
And we'll beat the birds
down to Acapulco Bay
It's perfect for a flying honeymoon
They say
Come fly with me
Let's fly, let's fly away.
Congratulations, man. She's great.
I love your friends.
That's the busboy, honey.
You even got me great busboys.
Now, let's have one more dance
with the bride and groom...
Are you still nervous?
No. And, Dean, thank you
for respecting my religious beliefs.
I'm really ready now.
Thank you, God!
I'm ready to do things to you
that no woman has ever done before.
How about a...?
Come on...
Here it is.
Oh, it's so...tasteful.
Oh, my God!
That's how much I love you, baby.
You must love me...a lot.
Take me, Dean.
- Don't tease me.
- I'm not.
I'm not a big fan of this material.
Angela?
Angela!
Don't do this to me, Angela.
Welcome back.
Oh, my God. What happened?
Not a whole hell of a lot.
Oh, my God. Are you kidding me?
Our wedding night?
Oh. I am a bad wife.
No. No. No, no, no.
I got some frostbite
in some very weird places.
You've got your whole life
to make it up to me.
- And I'm gonna start right now.
- Yeah?
OK.
Oh, my God, I'm gonna be sick.
Just give me a minute, baby.
No, no, no! There's no rush.
No rush.
I gotta stop by the office
before we leave for Barbados.
You can freshen up.
Just let me give you
a quick kiss goodbye.
No, no, no, no! That's OK.
That's OK. I-I-I'm late.
I'll see you in an hour, maybe two.
What the...?!
Nice security.
Sorry, boss.
I went to bed late last night.
But it's nothing compared to you,
huh?
Yeah. Is the Mercedes ready?
Yeah. Just about.
We switched the VIN and...
Wendy's making the pink slip
for you to sign.
That's a great wedding present,
boss.
Angela's going to go nuts for it,
huh?
Not as nuts as she was last night,
huh? Huh?
Hey, boss, was she worth the wait?
- Come on, boss...
- Hey! We're talking about my wife!
A man's wedding night
is his own private sacred business.
It's not to entertain lowlife scum
like yous guys.
Angela's got to be an animal.
He's even walking funny.
Hey, back to work.
Break is over, guys.
Oh, congratulations, Mr C.
I heard the wedding was awesome.
I'm almost through
with the docs on the Mercedes.
Thanks, Wendy.
Oh, boy.
Oh, boy.
You need to sign here,
and I think...
here.
Is it hard?
- What?
- Getting married.
I haven't been here long, but I've
heard stories about you and women.
Well, those days are all over,
Wendy.
Forever. It's...
Thank you.
Damn it.
Here, let me help you.
- Mr Cumanno!
- I'm sorry!
I'm so sorry, Wendy. I'm so sorry.
I'm just nuts today.
I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't.
I'm married, Wendy. I can't.
You're right. I'm sorry.
Screw it.
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. OK. OK.
- Oh, my God.
- Thanks.
- Is that frostbite?
- It's fine!
Piss off!
Baby, it's me.
Shit! Get out. Take the back stairs.
- My hair's stuck.
- What?!
- Dean?
- Honey.
I was feeling so much better,
I wanted to pick up where we left off.
That's great. You know what?
I'll finish here. I'll meet you
outside in a sex...sec.
OK.
I love you.
I love you too.
You look pretty.
- Come on.
- Ow! Not so fast.
- You are not welcome down there.
- I'm trying!
I can't believe it.
Is that Mercedes for...?
Dean.
Honey, this isn't
what it looks like.
I swear. Her hair got stuck in my
zipper. I wasn't getting nothing.
The happiest 17 hours of my life.
You just lost the best thing
you never had!
Angela, wait!
She seems...nice.
My client has agreed,
against my advice,
to settle
for a one time cash payment.
$300,000.
For one day?
One horribly traumatic day
in which my client suffered
irreparable psychological damage
to her self-esteem.
Oh, and she keeps the Mercedes.
- What?
- Bullshit.
We can drag it before a judge if you
think that would be more favourable.
That would put your client's
business under scrutiny.
What was it again, Mr Cumanno?
Random repossessions?
Give her what she wants.
I can't believe you wore the grey
dress. I distinctly said the blue.
- It worked, didn't it?
- You were lucky.
I was good.
Excuse me. I wonder if I could
ask your help for a moment.
I'm trying to find Route 40.
Route 40? Well, you're on it.
- That's it.
- What?
- Where is it?
- There.
That black thing
with the lines on it.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I didn't know where it was.
Thank you so much.
- My pleasure.
- Sorry to trouble you.
Forget it. You're not going to kill
yourself and stink up my new car.
Our new car.
Hey, Mom!
I only do these things
because I love you, Page.
How was the wedding?
Beautiful.
Like all my weddings.
You have any idea what that meat
is doing to your arteries?
Haven't you heard?
Cigarettes dissolve cholesterol.
No cards, Page.
- This is a classy place.
- It relaxes me.
So? How did we do?
Not too bad.
- How not too bad?
- About 80.
Plus the car.
That's it?
For that I lived four months
in a crap hotel without cable?
I'm so sick
of this small-time bullshit.
- I had to kiss that greasy mook.
- Dean wasn't so bad.
Anyway, we'll make more in
the next one. I'm thinking Seattle.
- Maybe San Francisco.
- Mom. Remember our deal.
- This was it. I'm going solo.
- Here we go.
It's happening, Mom. Accept it.
I am old enough to be on my own.
You have no idea
what it's like to be all alone.
I'll tell you what'll happen.
You'll go off, you'll get lonely,
some moron will come along,
you'll think it's true love,
you've never been
so sure of anything, and then bam.
He will pull a conceive and leave,
and then it's my life again.
I am not that stupid.
You know what I mean.
Well, you're right. I was stupid,
and it left me pregnant and alone.
If Barbara hadn't shown me
the con...
And you taught me. OK? I'll be fine.
OK. Fine.
If you've made up your mind,
we will go to New York
and divide up everything.
I'll get the cheque.
Oh, my Lord!
What seems to be the problem?
Well, I was just about to take
a bite and I saw glass. Look!
I am so sorry, ma'am.
This has never happened.
Of course, your meal
is complimentary.
Armand, a bottle of wine. Quickly.
Perhaps a 69 Merlot?
Those shoes are so wrong for this.
Thanks.
I don't understand the problem.
We deposit our money and you
give it back when we say so.
I'm afraid it's not that simple,
Ms Conners.
Hello. I'm Gloria Vogal. IRS.
Hello.
Oh, you've heard of us. I'm surprised.
We seldom hear from you.
Well, I suppose I might be a little
late with this year's return.
Maybe even the last seven.
Mother, I'm stunned.
I had no idea you would evade
your responsibilities...
Shut up, Ms Conners. We've never
seen a dime from you either.
Look, I know
what must have happened.
I always assumed that
my returns were filed by my husband.
Oh. Which one?
Look. Just because
I've had some trouble
- with my personal relationships...
- Ms Conners...
How you earn your money
is of no interest to the IRS.
How can I put this in language
you'll understand?
- We just want our cut.
- How much?
With interest and penalties,
the total comes to 247,811 dollars.
What?!
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
That is in addition to what
used to be in your accounts.
Your latest divorce settlement
arrived this morning. Thanks.
But that's everything.
It's not all bad. We'll give you
a full 90 days to pay.
Or...
we move forward
with criminal charges
for felony tax evasion and fraud.
Good luck.
Here's the last of our cash.
That's $1,300 each.
Wow. Have a nice life with that,
princess.
- I'll economise.
- Sure.
You can do your own hair
and your own nails.
They actually have some great shoes
at Wal-Mart.
All right!
One more con,
but only if we do it right.
What does that mean?
No more small-time crap.
It has to be big.
One big final score to pay off
the IRS and set me up on my own.
What are you talking about?
Palm Beach.
Palm Beach? Forget it!
People that rich are already
suspicious. It's too hard to play.
Palm Beach or nothing.
Too expensive.
Let's find something else.
I am home.
What's the best way to get a room?
I was thinking the Trogden Triangle.
Right. But where are we going to
find a trumpet and a talking parrot?
I was thinking something simple,
traditional.
- The flopper diver.
- No way am I...
Oh, my God!
She's cracked her head open!
Oh, darling. Careful.
You may be paralysed.
Call a doctor.
Although I'm sure she'll be fine.
Yeah. I think I'm...
Just please let me know
if there's anything else we can do.
You might consider
investing in a mop.
Once again, I apologise.
Since we seem to have lost
your reservation,
we can let you have this suite
for one night.
Then I'm sure we can work
something out.
Could everyone please
just let her rest now?
Don't you ever flop me
without my consent.
It had to look real. You fall lousy
when you know it's coming.
I fall fine.
- Fake.
- Oh, shut up.
No, don't do that.
No! Stop!
Hey, boss. Just got three Camrys in.
Cherry.
Parts'll bring in a hundred thou,
easy.
Great.
The change of title came through
on the Mercedes. You have to sign.
Bitch.
You know...
This is the eighth frame
we've gone through in a week.
Maybe it's time
to retire this picture.
Why can't I stop thinking about her?
Was it the legs?
- She had amazing legs.
- Give me that!
Or maybe it was that she dumped you.
'Cause that's never happened before.
Yeah. Yeah.
Who the hell does she think she is?
Does she think she can do this
to me? Well, she's wrong!
I'm going to find her.
And then?
Then I'm going to take care of it.
Doctor Arnold Davis.
Made huge money when an old uncle
died. 45. Pretty good shape.
- Who's the old bag?
- His mom. She lives with him.
Forget it. He's taken. Momma's boy.
- We could get around her.
- Pass. Mothers are death.
Can't argue that.
David D Cummings.
Just ended marriage number three.
The downside?
Very big on iron-clad prenups,
and, as you can see,
massive competition.
We could handle 'em.
We'd have to be into a group thing.
Ménage à trois?
Try ménage à cinque.
Pass.
William E Tensy.
CEO of Tensy Tobacco.
Old money, but also just plain old.
Go on! Get out!
Goddamn! Go!
- How much?
- Three billion. More every day.
- Hmm...
- I am not dating the walking dead.
The older the better. With luck,
they die right after the wedding.
I'd have to kiss that?
I'd have to kiss that more than you.
Well, maybe you're into necrophilia.
We'd better work fast.
Why can't we pick someone
who's just a little bit cute?
- Dean was kind of cute.
- You're in serious denial.
Cute is dangerous.
Cute leads to feeling, which leads
to screwing, which leads to screwed.
I know we could make that doctor
and his mom work.
We're doing Tensy. That's that.
That is not that. If you want to
work Tensy, fine. I'm working Davis.
Page, I've told you before,
no simultaneous cons.
Too many angles.
They always go bad.
- But it's not just that, is it?
- What?
You don't think I can be primary.
I didn't say that.
Although it does take
an enormous amount of skill.
I can make men do anything.
Boys. You can make boys do anything.
Gas station attendants, bartenders,
the odd migrant worker.
A one-shot seduction is child's play
compared to getting someone
to marry you in three months.
- Four months.
- What?
Well, it took you four months
this time.
You used to be able to do it
in three.
What are you saying? That I'm
losing it? That I'm getting too old?
- I didn't say that.
- I'm in terrific shape.
Feel my butt.
I am not feeling your butt again,
Mother. We all know it's wonderful.
Tell you what. We'll play for it.
Winner picks the mark.
Great. We'll cut cards.
Right!
I'm going to trust your cards?
See that guy over at the bar?
First one to get him
to buy her a drink wins.
Deal.
Hot.
Yeah. Sure is.
Let me get that for you. Here we go.
Oh, my.
Would you?
Sure.
Oh, you're so kind.
I'm Betty.
- Hi. My name is...
- Excuse me.
May I grab your nuts?
Salty.
Are you OK? Can I get you a drink?
- We go with Tensy.
- Stupid jerk.
He doesn't look so bad in this light.
Oh, yeah. His liver spots
are positively glowing.
- Let's run through it once more.
- I know what to do.
Got a light?
Yeah.
Your trash is on fire.
Holy shit!
- Set.
- Good.
Stay by the phone. Timing is crucial.
Always treating me like a child.
Child!
Excuse me, sir,
but smoking is not permitted.
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
Nazi.
Pardon me.
Is no crime.
OK, Doctor Davis. Let's see
where you're going tonight.
Good start, Page.
Crap!
Davis residence.
Arnold Davis, please.
Sorry, he'sjust left.
Oh, no. This is...
He left me a message...
I'm supposed to meet him.
Who is this?
This is... Stupid cellphone.
Mrs Wyler?
Right. This is Mrs Wyler.
I believe he said The Glades.
And that's on...
I think it's on the far end
of 0cean.
Great. Cutting out. Thank...
Hi, can I get you a drink?
Wow, I've never heard that one
before.
You've blown me away
with your creativity.
- Well, I uh...
- ''Well, I uh...''
Your recovery's even better.
Do you even care at all who I am?
I could be the anti-Christ or have
the intelligence of a thermos,
but those are not the matters
the male penis ponders.
So please tell me,
why did you walk all the way over
here to ask to get me a drink?
Well, because I'm the bartender.
Martini. Very dry.
Sure.
Our next item is an exquisite piece
from the Kerner estate.
A stunning work by Fyodor Turgenev
entitled ''Form In Repose''.
I'm looking for an opening bid
of 130,000.
- 130!
- Very good.
I have 130. Do I hear 140?
Thank you. Do I hear 150?
I am offer of 170.
Was that 175, sir?
I'll take that. 175,000.
I have 180. Do I hear 190?
Do I hear 190?
I really must hear a number
or see a paddle, sir.
- I think he...
- Yes, ma'am. I have your bid.
It's to you at $180,000.
Going once, twice...
Sold to the persistent woman
on my right.
Thanks. You did good. Bye.
Er, that's 3.50.
I'll flip you for it. Call it.
- No. We don't really...
- Call it.
Tails.
Heads. Aw, too bad.
Thanks.
Wow, Jack. She got a free drink
and one of your balls.
I just think she's nervous
being on her own.
Yeah. She's a delicate flower.
Oh, wait. I think I see crack.
That's just his butt, lady.
Let me see.
Looks good.
From where I'm standing.
- Oh!
- Oh, my God!
What? What is the matter?
My beautiful man. He ruined.
Ruined!
We can have this expertly repaired.
No. Man thing off. Deal off.
What good is to me now?
He has no...pipiska.
Mother, did you have any trouble
finding the place?
- This is beyond civilisation.
- Son of a bitch.
- Ow!
- Oh! Oh, my baby!
I am so sorry.
Get away from him!
I told you it was dangerous
to come to these low-class bars.
It stings, Mother! It stings so bad!
- Mother will help you.
- The retina is detached. I know it!
Are you OK now?
Yes, you idiot!
Idi what?
Yeah?
Subject will pass the checkpoint
in ten minutes. Everything set?
Yeah, of course.
What's wrong, Page?
Mother can tell something's wrong.
Mother knows nothing.
I'm following right behind him,
so be sure to remove the spikes.
And he mustn't see you,
so we can bond.
I know. You're driving me crazy.
You're driving me crazy.
That answers the question of whether
you're already in a relationship.
Since you can't seem to read
my subtle signals, I'll help you out.
Piss off!
Everyone's a little irritable
after they choke.
Two headlights. That's not him.
That was wrong on so many levels.
You!
- What happened?
- What are you doing here?
- I followed you.
- More like stalked me.
Listen, mouthbreather,
I am fully capable
and really in the mood to kick
the shit out of your psychotic ass!
Does this look familiar?
Might be mine.
Well, if you're not sure...
Thanks. Now go.
My car doesn't drive good
with a tree in it.
What a baby. It's a flat.
I'll fix it.
Wait. We'd better clear that stuff
out of the road.
No. I'll do it. Just get the spare.
Now!
Look, I'm willing to explore
the ''being dominated'' thing,
but let's take it slow.
- Uh-oh.
- Watch out!
What did you push me for?
I saved you, you moron.
That can't be good.
Wait, wait. I'm hurt.
No, you're not.
Nothing could hurt you.
Are you calling me a liar?
Where are you hurt?
My ankle.
See?
What the hell?
Perfect.
No!
- They're really piling up...
- Oh, my ankle.
Your ankle is fine. I'm going.
Are you mixing medications?
You're ruining the magic, idiot.
I much sorry.
Must be glass in road.
Oh, the statue stealer.
Whenever I see you, things seem
to be going into the crapper.
You have head injury.
I rush you to hospital.
No, no, no. I don't.
I don't.
The police will be along shortly
and they'll sort this out.
See? Delayed shooting head pains.
Come. To hospital we go.
What about your car?
You have flat tyres.
- Is nothing.
- Oh.
What are you doing? Get off me.
What?
- You were the one...
- I gotta go.
How do I look?
If I were a guy, I'd do you.
You're sweet.
I'm going back to the hospital
to see if I can fix the mess
you made last night.
With that on,
he'll forgive anything.
He better, for your sake.
Be nice or I won't tell you
which eye looks bigger.
- Which?
- Are you gonna be nice?
I'm always nice.
The left. Here, use my eyeliner.
Shit.
I want my purse, jerk-off!
That's not very friendly.
Now, go back out and when you kick
the door open, say something nice.
You stole my purse, dipshit,
so I'd have to see
your ugly-ass face again.
No. You forgot your purse
for the second time
because you were in such a hurry
to leave me stranded.
Give it to me. Or would you rather
have my heel up your ass?
Who told you I'm into that?
Pretty rough on the boss.
He's not really into ass play.
That's just his sense of humour.
He owns this place?
Yeah. His dad left it to him.
These development creeps are trying
to give him three mil for the place.
Whole world's gonna be
Gaps and Starbucks.
He's loaded. Good, Page.
Greetings.
Oh, it's you.
Doctors don't want me to smoke.
It's ridiculous.
They depend on cigarettes.
They're a perfect scapegoat
for their incompetence.
You're here about the insurance.
My attorneys will take care...
That won't be necessary.
I have no want to sue you.
Sue me? My people will tear you
a new heinie.
I am only come to see how you feel.
My poor...
poor...
babushka.
That's very nice of you, Mrs er...
Miss. Just call me...
Ulga.
- Ulga?
- Mmm.
Well, that's lovely, Ulga.
Yes?
- I am Ulga Yevanova. I am here...
- Yes.
We've been expecting you.
I am Miss Madress.
I run this household.
Oh, good for you.
I will announce you.
We have a bitch alert.
Come on, bartender, it's your
night off. Do something fun.
Good boy.
I love it here.
It's the only bloody place left
that doesn't make you feel
like a killer for having a smoke.
Yes. Is lovely.
Dobriy vecher.
I'll be your waiter tonight -
Vladimir.
Allow me to tell you
tonight's specials.
No need for English. We have
one of your countrywomen here.
Oh, wonderful.
So tonight we have
cutleta po kievsky.
- Da.
- Bifstek potatarsky.
Da. Da.
E adibris dilatina.
Oh.
Dilatina.
Excellent choice. The steak tartare.
Oh, I love a woman
who eats raw meat.
Oh. That's real nice.
You're not just going
to stand there? Help me.
Please.
Isn't that the shoe
you wanted to jam up my ass?
No. That was the six-inch heel.
Now come on.
What are you doing here?
Working.
Working?
You some kind of wilderness
female mud wrestler?
I'm an environmentalist
studying the effect of waste run-off
in the neighbouring wetlands.
Oh. Well...
you environmentalists
really dress hot.
There's no law to say you can't
look good while you're saving stuff.
So why are you following me?
- I'm not following you!
- Then what are you doing here?
Come on. I'll show you.
You're not out here burying
high school kids, are you?
Well, they egged my car.
What do you do? Spy on people
humping in boats? That's perverted.
I photograph stars.
Just because they're famous doesn't
mean they don't deserve privacy too.
Who you got?
The stars up there.
You sneak way out here
to stare at space and shit?
No. I come here to get away
from the lights of the city,
so I can see the space and shit.
- Why?
- Take a look.
Jesus.
That's the Crab Nebula.
That is the exact colour
of a sapphire ring I've wanted.
OK.
And this...
is the Great Globular Cluster
in Hercules.
I don't think I want to see that.
Wow.
Good cluster.
And I think you can also see
the Corona Borealis tonight.
Wait, wait. I'm not done
with the globular thing.
OK.
I love to watch a woman eat.
It is surely
one of the most sensual acts.
Da.
Da. Da.
- Da.
- Da?
Is such joy to hear
my native tongue again.
I deeply appreciate what you say
and er...
what you don't say.
Oh, William. So much loudness.
Can we not go somewhere
I can relate to you...
orally?
All right! Who will favour us
with next song?
We have a fellow countrywoman here!
Oh, no, I am so...
Please, I am so not musical.
- Please...
- How about Karabushka?
There isn't a Russian alive
who doesn't know Karabushka!
Da, da
Karabuschka
Da, da
Da, da...
Aah... Moscow
Da, da... Leningrad
Er, Minsk and...
Oh, you know...
I am just fooling.
I am so full of good humour.
Flew in from Miami Beach
B-0-A-C
Didn't get to bed last night
was on my knee
Man, I had a dreadful flight
I'm back in the USSR
You don't know how lucky you are,
boy
Back in the USSR
Been away so long
I hardly knew the place
Gee, it's good to be back home
Leave it to tomorrow
to unpack my case
Honey, disconnect the phone
I'm back in the USSR
You don't know how lucky you are,
boy
Back in the US, back in the US
Back in the USSR...
Look, there's another one.
There's two at once.
Did you see that?
Yeah. God, I never knew you could
have this much fun for free.
Well, it's not completely free.
So are you ready
to tell me the truth?
What?
Tell me why you're here really.
I told you.
I'm an environmentalist...
student at the University of Miami.
What, you don't believe me?
Well, I'd like to, but...
What about my butt?
Oh, I gotta go.
- Again?
- Yeah. I have work to do.
It's eleven o'clock at night.
I have to write
an environmental impact report.
Will it mention me?
- Wait! What's your name?
- Jane.
- Will I see you again?
- Try wishing on a star!
Is that five people?
Keys are in it.
Hey, Mom. How did it go?
Perfect.
His infatuation
is right on schedule.
You're home now.
You could stop with the accent.
What's that?
What's what?
Mud?
I gave myself a facial.
Some special local stuff.
I think I'm gonna take a nice
long shower and go to bed.
Smoking is part of the fun
of being a kid.
Yeah. We just did some tests
on some nine-year-olds.
After a little puking, you couldn't
drag them away from the stuff.
You're only young once.
Why not indulge them, I say.
- Ooh!
- Oh, darling. What matter?
Head pain back again?
No, no, no. It's all right.
Ulga.
Ulga?
I have a gift for you.
A gift?
A gift! Oh!
A personal fire device.
I'm not insisting
you take up smoking,
but I thought it would
give you some incentive.
There is nothing sexier
than smoke billowing proudly
out of a woman's hot, red...
engorged nostrils.
That image will haunt me.
- Still a little sleepy, my dear?
- Oh, no.
No. It was another wonderful night.
I think that I deserve a big kiss
for that big gift.
Oh, yes.
Is no getting around that.
Oh, no, we mustn't.
God is everywhere.
Yes, he is, isn't he?
Nosy bastard.
I'll have Miss Madress
get your purse.
Is he that repulsive to you?
No. Is er...
a Russian expression of happiness.
Poy, poy, oy, I'm so happy.
Save it. I'm on to you.
You are attracted to me?
Oh, flattering, but I no do females.
I've been with him for seven years.
I've seen him with many women.
I've never worried.
Passing amusements.
But you. Oh, you're good, baby.
I no understand. What is you want?
I is want your ex-commie ass
out of his life.
I didn't put up with his crap just
to be squeezed out before he kicks.
I expect a big pay-off!
You must believe.
I have true feelings for him.
Oh, spare me
your Bolshevik bullshit.
Either you disappear
or I tell him exactly what I saw.
Your dark honesty is refreshing.
But please, I beg you,
leave me one more night
to bow out gracefully.
I have something for you.
I know it's not the sapphire
you wanted, but...
It sure isn't.
- It's a meteor fragment.
- Like the ones we were watching?
That's been to the far reaches
of our solar system.
No lousy sapphire's
ever pulled that off.
You don't do anything
like normal people, do you?
Some things.
Kitchen's through there,
master bedroom's upstairs,
her room is down the hall.
You have seven minutes.
Here you go.
The thing that's screwing us
is all this second-hand smoke
nonsense.
They've convicted the tobacco
companies without any evidence.
Hmm. Is oddness.
What?
Costly lighter gift you gave
is missing.
You must have left it somewhere.
Never. I cherish too much.
Perhaps...
No.
Is inconceivablish.
What is inconceivablish?
Well, your housekeeper
did much admire,
and when she gave me purse
to leave yesterday,
was open.
Sir, I would never take so much
as a hairpin from this household.
Is this not clothing you wear
yesterday when you see me out?
Hello.
No. She set me up.
She could have slipped that
into my pocket any time.
You doubt me?
Oh, William.
Oh! How you can sleep on
so lumpy a...
My wife's old jewellery!
Why are you stealing
from loyal, kind employer man?
No! It's her! Can't you see?
You bitch!
My cigarettes!
I feel like vomiting!
Oh, please, Mr Tensy!
I have been a dedicated and
trustworthy servant for seven years.
Look into my eyes.
You must believe in my complete
and total innocence.
If it's at all possible...could you
slap her around a little bit?
Very good, darling.
You're doing better.
Come on, let's hear a little pain.
I've set you up with an interview
with Tensy tomorrow.
Tomorrow? That's Saturday.
- There are no weekends in conning.
- I'll go first thing Monday.
No. We can't take the chance
of someone else getting that job.
You have to get close to him.
He's days away
from popping the question.
No way. You couldn't
have gotten him that far this fast.
Have you really learned so little?
One month flat.
That's a new record.
Mom's still got it.
Jack, I'm still coming to the game,
but I might be late.
I'm sure the van can wait
for five minutes.
I'll probably make it on time
anyway. I've gotta go. Bye.
Sorry I'm running late,
Miss Brekenhal,
but I've been losing consciousness
more frequently lately.
Allergy season, I think.
That's no problem at all.
Please call me Alison.
Oh, well, Alison. I just have
a few questions to ask you.
Do you smoke, Alison?
No.
No. Well...
We've gotta go!
She said she'd be a little late.
Twenty minutes is not a little.
We've entered ''stood up'' territory.
I worked for the English ambassador
to Turkey until they shot him.
They shot him.
But I kept cleaning
till they burned the Embassy down.
Well, that was very loyal.
So when should I start?
If you just fill out
this application form,
and I can verify your employment.
Oh, certainly.
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
I'll get towel.
Here.
You seem very dedicated
to your work, Alison.
Something inside me.
This need to please my employer
in any way possible.
Here is towel, and I find
other employment form.
I don't think that'll be necessary.
Alison seems...
more than qualified.
It's still wet.
Not bad, huh?
What?
It's just a little hacky
to go right for the member massage.
What are you doing
the rest of today?
I don't know.
Beach, nap, nothing. See ya.
Shit!
Shit, shit, shit!
You really are a delicate flower.
Jack! You missed the game.
Why didn't you go?
I don't know.
My friends have this theory that...
I'm in love with you.
Hello, daughter.
What are you doing here?
I thought you'd be out with Tensy.
Sometimes people
aren't where they say.
I got bored here,
so I took myself out for a walk.
Bullshit.
I saw you with your boyfriend.
You spied on me?
So this is why
you've been so nice to me.
- I have not been nice to you!
- You betray me for some bartender.
That bartender owns the bar and has
an offer to sell for three million.
You're not ready, Page.
Yeah. I already got him
to say he loves me.
You're not ready to con a guy
without falling in love yourself.
I am in complete control.
I saw the kiss.
Your eyes were closed.
That was the sun.
Last time the sun got in my eyes,
I got a daughter.
And that's the worst thing
that every happened to you.
I'm a pro, Mother, and I'll prove it.
There. Nothing.
But the best from you.
Give me a chance to make it
even better.
- Crap!
- What's wrong?
- I gotta go.
- Why?
- Because I'm no good for you.
- I'll be the judge of that.
You have to trust me.
I am not a good person.
No, you are good.
You may not know it, but I do.
You come on tough,
but it's just an act.
You don't even believe in sleeping
together. You're like an Osmond.
Look, you don't get it. I haven't
been completely honest with you.
Look, I know you're not really
an environmentalist, OK?
Who cares? The important thing is
I love you and I want to be with you.
I gotta go.
You win. I dropped the con.
It's for the best, dear.
Shut up, Mother.
Barbara.
You are a lifesaver.
To pull that job off
on such short notice.
I was taught by the best.
I had a blast. I've been out of the
game for so long, I forgot it's fun,
even though we were conning
your daughter,
who I haven't seen
since she was four.
Three.
But we weren't conning her.
We were protecting her.
She wanted to run off on her own.
This was the only way to stop her.
You won't be able
to stop her forever.
I know that. Page is an amazing,
brilliant, talented girl.
But she's still green.
When she's ready, I'll tell her.
You're sure she's not ready now?
I just caught her kissing
some loser with her eyes closed.
Really?
I'll get this.
Classy. I'm still learning from you.
Sweetie, I'm home.
Sounds like a good day.
Yeah, it was fantastic.
Is Tensy the largest producer
of phlegm on the East Coast?
I just quit smoking.
Well, the good news keeps on coming.
Hey, I got a killer dress
for tonight.
That plus the official letter
cannot fail. You want to see?
No. I'm going out for a walk.
OK. Well...I'm already late.
Jane, Jane, don't hang up!
You gotta give up on that girl, man.
Yeah. There's something weird
about her.
Yeah, but that's what I liked.
Me too.
What are you doing here?
I was coming to you.
Let me in. I have a surprise.
Moment. Am naked.
I don't see a problem there.
Here I come.
- Oh, my!
- Completely restored.
Only 7,000 for a new willie.
Oh, is so nice.
But, William, you know
how the Lord feels
about having men in hotel room.
Even a man who has ordered champagne
and oysters from room service?
It's OK. I didn't charge it
to your room.
I cannot anymore see you.
Why on earth not?
Let us leave at that.
Make pain less.
Goodbye...forever.
No, no. What is this all about?
''We regret to inform you that your
application for permanent residence
''has been denied.
''You must leave the country
no later than tomorrow.''
Oh, I try everything!
But is very political red tape
to get green card
and I am loopholeless.
Well, this is horrible.
And I was going to ask you
to marry me.
Marry you?
Yes.
Yes, I...
purchased a ring and...
everything.
But with your leaving...
I am but ignorant unintelligible
foreigner,
but if you marry me, I believe
that puts kibosh on deportation.
Really?
Oh, Ulga, Ulga.
Will you...
What?
Marry me?
Oh, marry you.
Oh, is legal question.
Yes, I will.
Is binding answer.
Leave me alone.
I'm engaged! We're talking
a settlement of 20 million minimum.
We're finally set for life, darling.
I just have time for one quick whoo!
I said whoo.
Why won't you talk to me?
There's nothing to say.
I scared you when I told you
I loved you, didn't I?
Jack, there is no love.
It's just a trick of the brain -
a combination of hormones
and chemicals.
Then why are you here?
Tell me to my face
you don't love me.
I don't love you.
Wow. More believable
than I thought it would be.
I know I freaked you out
by moving too fast
with all that ''I love you'' stuff.
So let's just...get married.
I gotta go.
That is jarring.
My love, tonight we will celebrate
this ecstatic joining of our spirits
with the union...
of our aching bodies.
Oh, you have stomach cramp again.
No. I ache for you, my pumpkin.
Let's hump.
William, my religion.
Humping is not yet allowed.
Of course it is.
I proposed, you accepted.
To God, everything else
is just paperwork.
William, I insist we wait
till after wedding.
Ulga, I am much more powerful
than you.
Now just relax and enjoy it.
William?
William? Oh.
Always something in your mouth.
William?
Are you dead?
No.
No! Why me?
Oh, wake up, you disgusting shit!
Twenty million.
- What?
- I need you here.
Well, that's real attractive.
We've got to make it look like
he died at his house alone.
Room service!
Let's get him to the bedroom.
OK. Too far.
The balcony.
Just hold him. I'll be right back.
Champagne and oysters.
- All this just for you?
- Oh, yes.
I mean, someone is joining me.
- I'll open the champagne.
- I'll take care of it.
Thank you. Tip's included.
Good night.
I ask you to do one simple thing...
I don't consider holding
a 500-pound corpse simple.
- You flung open the door...
- I didn't fling it!
We just have to get the body
back to the house.
Have you seen her?
Dean.
Shit!
- Angela!
- I'll meet you in five minutes.
- He looks pissed.
- I'll handle him.
Angela!
Angela!
Angela!
- Angela!
- Oh, God!
Angela, stop!
I have missed you so much. So much.
I've never been so in love
with anybody in my entire life.
I'm begging you!
Just give me one more chance.
Marry me again.
What? Get up.
How did you find me?
The title for the Mercedes
gave this as your address.
I drove straight through.
Your hair's different.
It looks really pretty. I like it.
- Give me a kiss.
- No.
No, no, I've changed.
I've totally changed. This place
is crawling with prime trim,
I'm barely even noticing.
- I can't deal with this now.
- No, listen to me!
I'm not leaving without you.
I love you.
I don't care who hears it.
I love her! I love her! I love her!
I love her! What do you want me
to do? You want me to sing?
Come fly with me
- Come fly, come fly...
- Shut up!
What do you want, baby?
I'll do anything.
Anything?
I had no idea
you were into this stuff. Ow!
I've been trying
a lot of new things lately.
Oh, wait. I don't know about that.
Are you questioning me?
No. No, no, no. It's just...
Kiss my foot and apologise.
I'm sorry. Ah...
Good boy.
Oooh, yes.
Now, I'm just gonna get some...
whipped cream.
I got no problem with that.
I'll be right back.
Hurry up.
Careful. We don't want
any more damage to the body.
- Housekeeping!
- No. No. No!
Housekeeping.
No! No! No! No!
I don't need anything.
Please just get lost.
Lady!
You know, I've been cleaning
this room for three weeks,
and so far, no tip.
- There's 20 bucks in my pants.
- 20?
How about I sit on your kinky face
for a while?
OK, OK, OK! 50.
That's more like it.
Unbelievable.
Both of these wallets yours?
Two wallets? Untie me.
Now, that'll be another 20.
All right. He's sleeping.
He wakes up having one
of his famous coughing fits,
flails around, and falls onto
the statue becoming peniley impaled.
That's believable, right?
I just really need a shower.
Where's the penis?
It's still there. It's just
the rigor mortis is gone.
Not his, the statue's.
It's still in the car. I'll get it.
There you go.
This is...
This is unbelievable.
Oh, God!
You are so enormous.
You gold-digging whore!
You're already working someone else?
Get off of her, asshole! Get off!
- Don't shoot him, Dean.
- Why not?
He's already dead.
Oh, you are one sick slut!
I am not a sick slut.
One penis coming up, Mom!
- Wendy?
- Er, hello.
Mom?
- You're her mother?
- It's just a nickname.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
- You two played me.
- Oh, no.
The whole marriage was bullshit.
And this one you even offed!
We didn't off him.
He coughed himself to death.
Yeah, right! You let
your own daughter seduce me?!
Do you know how much therapy
you people need?
Look, Dean...
I don't blame you for being upset.
We did an awful thing.
And for the first time,
I feel really bad about it.
But maybe,
despite all this craziness,
there's still hope for us after all.
There's more hope for you and him
than for us!
Dean, please tell me it's OK.
I love you.
Forget it.
Fine! Look, you brought this
on yourself.
- You cheated on me.
- You set me up to cheat!
We can't make a scumbag do anything
he wouldn't do...
Shut up, junior slut!
Get over there!
You two got some brass balls
in those panties. I'll give you that.
In the few moments you have left...
I want to see some begging
and some pleading.
Mom...
Dean, you got so many tells.
You are not the killing type.
Don't screw with me.
I'm on a fine edge here. Don't.
See? No bullets.
Fine. So I'm not that big
on homicide!
But I could do worse!
I found all your IDs!
All your aliases.
I'll get them to the cops when they
start investigating decomposing boy!
You two will get
some filthy lesbo lockdown!
With bad lighting!
I don't have to kill you
to kill you.
Dean, wait! Look, what if
we gave you back your money?
Well?
I stopped walking, didn't I?
First you've got to help us
make it look like this creep died
here, so there's no questions.
- You know how to do that?
- I'm from Jersey, aren't I?
Boy, Dean was really incredible
with that body.
Well, you gonna let me in
on the play?
What play?
You promised that mook 300,000.
When we take him to the bank,
we'll be about 300,000 short.
- The money will be there.
- What?
I don't want a big scene about this,
but Mrs Vogal from the IRS
was more of a
''protecting you from making the
worst mistake of your life'' thing
than a ''the government
took all our money'' thing. OK?
What?
I pulled a tiny little con
to keep you from leaving.
Oh, you bitch of bitches!
Stop it!
There seems to be a problem
with your account, Ms Conners.
- It was closed yesterday.
- That's impossible.
- What the hell is going on?
- Nothing. I swear.
Here's the signature.
Barbara.
Wait.
I gave my old partner all my account
numbers for the IRS scam
and that hag ripped off every penny!
Tell that to your cellmates.
For once she's telling the truth.
I'm going to believe the seed of Satan?
Give me the keys to my car.
- What?
- Give me the keys to the Mercedes.
Goodbye.
I can't believe it. I can't believe
this. I've blown both our lives.
I'm sorry, Page.
I'm a terrible person.
I'm a terrible mother.
I'm a terrible everything.
Aw... You're finally
seeing things clearly.
What the hell are you doing?
You want money? The guy who wants to
marry me is worth 1.5 in a divorce.
- She's just gonna screw with him.
- Hugely.
I was wondering how long
you were gonna stay this time.
Look...
I know I've been horrible,
but this talk about love and marriage
can make anyone act freaky.
I know that I must seem
like a mean selfish bitch, but...
No. You seem like the sweetest,
most wonderful person I've ever met.
What a moron.
Friends, employees,
beer wholesaler...
I have an announcement.
Jane and I are getting married.
- That is awesome!
- Yeah.
Jane, come here.
Jack, so now that you have
some extra responsibilities,
that doesn't mean
you're going to sell this place?
No. We'll do just fine.
Thanks, man.
Sell what, honey?
Nothing. Someone offered me three
million for the bar and the land.
Three million.
That sounds like something.
Yeah, but this place was my dad's.
You know, it's home.
It's too late anyway.
They got another lot.
Yeah.
There's no money. I'm bailing.
No! You can still get
a decent settlement.
He'll lose the bar.
This is wrong. It's over.
She's growing a conscience
on my score?
Don't make her do this.
I'll get your money.
No. We're doing it.
May I have this dance?
Um, Jack...
I gotta go.
Is that who I think it is? Jane!
Is it. How are you, darling?
Pissed off.
We were just on our way
to see you at the hotel.
Oh, this isn't Jack, is it?
Jane goes on and on about you.
I think she's in love!
I'm Betty, Jane's second cousin,
and this is my brother.
Vinny Staggliano.
I'm afraid you caught us
at a weird time.
I just asked asked Jane
to marry me and...
Oh, that's great! Congratulations.
I think she's having
second thoughts.
That's just the way our Jane is.
But she gets over it though.
Especially when her family's here.
Why don't you kiss and make up?
- I'm not really in the mood...
- Kiss. That's nice.
I think your relatives
are gonna like Bill's boat.
Who cares what they like?
Nice boat.
I'm so sorry. I'm so clumsy.
That's OK.
- How ya doing, Skippy?
- Hey.
Hey, you.
I got the lotion.
Who's got the hands?
Don't look at me.
I don't like getting all gunky.
Jack, would you mind?
- Sure.
- Thanks, babe.
You are the most kind,
wonderful man.
Look at all the fish.
Got it. This is gonna be a fun trip.
I honestly don't know why you'd
want to wear an off-the-shoulder.
This is what I want.
Fine. What would I know?
I've only been married 13 times.
I'm coming out. You'd better be nice.
I'm always nice.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Fine.
If you're going to be sarcastic.
I'm not being sarcastic.
It's perfect.
Really?
There's nothing you would change?
Not a thing.
Oh, my God.
I might just see
what it looks like without this.
I take it back.
No. No, I like that idea.
So, Mother likes it?
- She's not my mother.
- I'm not her mother.
You really are good at this.
I'm almost buying it.
Ladies and gentlemen,
friends and family.
We have come here today
to celebrate two wonderful people
who have managed to find each other
in this sometimes
seemingly cold world,
and pledge their hearts.
Do you, Jack Withrowe,
take this woman to be
your lawful wedded wife,
to love her, honour her
and cherish her
until death do you part?
I do.
And do you, Jane Helstrom,
take this man to be
your lawful wedded husband,
to love, honour and to cherish him
until death do you part?
I do.
What?
I do.
I now pronounce you husband
and wife, and you may kiss the bride.
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you
Mr and Mrs Withrowe.
Make sure he sees you drinking a lot.
That won't be hard.
There's my wonderful
new daughter-in-law.
- Are you avoiding me?
- Uh, no.
I gotta go.
Don't let it bother you.
She's shyer than shit.
What is it you do, Mr Staggliano?
College professor.
Oh, what do you teach?
College stuff.
What are you, a fucking cop?
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
I'll only need 30 minutes.
It won't work. He loves me too much.
Men don't turn women down.
Just like our first date,
only less mud.
It's beautiful.
Happy?
I always know the right thing
to say.
I love you...Jack.
I love you very much.
You're different, aren't you?
You wouldn't let anything ruin this.
Well, sometimes these hotel soaps
irritate my skin.
I'm serious.
Say nothing will ruin us.
Nothing will ever take me away
or keep me from loving you.
Um...can I have some water?
I think I drank too much champagne.
OK.
Jane?
Jack?
What are you doing out here alone?
Oh, my wife celebrated herself
into an early coma.
Well, her loss is my gain.
Walk me to my room.
I have a wedding gift for you.
No, that's OK. I was just gonna...
Oh, come on. You can't turn down
a wedding gift. It's bad luck.
- I never heard that.
- Sure.
Everything to do with weddings
is bad luck.
I can only stay a minute.
Will you just relax?
OK? Sit down.
This hotel is so nice.
I'm so glad my brother and I
decided to stay here too.
Er, yeah, it's...
You mentioned something about a gift.
You're so greedy.
But I happen to have it right here.
Cognac. Wow.
Jane is gonna love this.
Thank you so much.
Oh, can't we just try some?
Please?
Jack.
Thought you might not
want to wait alone. Ow!
Ow, ow. Could be wrong.
It feels good going down, doesn't it?
It's er...
It's really good.
No, thanks. I should
be getting back to Jane.
Jack, she's asleep.
Come on. You deserve to have
a bit of fun on your wedding night.
It's just fruit.
It's just a waste of time.
He's just gonna throw her out
on her ass. I'm not worried.
Is that why you're melting down
the remote?
Cute.
You got a tiny bit of cream...
right...
- I gotta go.
- Oh, why?
- I just can't do this.
- What's the matter?
Is it because
you don't find me attractive?
No. No. A part of me
is very, very interested,
but the other parts are yelling,
''You just married her cousin.''
Jane would never know. I promise.
Yeah, but I would.
I could never do that
to someone I love.
Yeah.
You really do love her, don't you?
Yeah, and I really
should be getting back.
Look, I'm sorry, I'm really sorry.
Please don't leave like this.
Can't we just, you know,
have a make-up drink or something?
I'll be good, I promise.
Please.
- I'm going over there.
- It isn't time yet.
I don't care, you shit!
I can't do this to him.
It hurts when you screw
with people's feelings.
Not as much as this.
Oh, my God! Jane!
What?
I'm sorry.
While we are willing to admit some
wrongdoing on the part of my client,
given the extremely short duration
of the marriage...
No negotiation.
Give her whatever she wants.
We talked about you not saying that.
Give her whatever she wants.
Jane. Jane!
I don't know what happened.
It was weird.
There's only one man in the world.
What the hell's taking so long?
Oh, relax. You'll get your money.
You destroyed my daughter,
but you'll get it.
Hey, I was minding my own business
when you bitches came along
and ripped out my heart
for a game of hacky sack!
Come off it.
We're both the same. Scum.
We are not the same.
I wasn't lying when I said ''I do''.
No, you were lying
when you tried to nail Page.
Look, where I come from
guys make mistakes sometimes.
It didn't change the fact
that I loved you.
I know I wouldn't do it again.
- Because you got caught.
- No.
Because of what I lost.
I'm not the only guy in the world
that's ever screwed up.
Even a goody-goody like Jack
can't keep his wang in the hanger.
Yes, he can.
- What did you say?
- Nothing.
No, no, no. What did you say?
I micked him.
Strictotoxin.
You're between out and awake.
I makes people easy to handle.
Whoa! Wait. You're kidding?
He said no,
and you let her believe
he went for a soil sample?
That's a new low, even for you!
Look, you wanted your money.
What was I supposed to do?
Tell her the guy you made us con
was the only decent guy she ever met?
This is just too sick!
I thought this revenge thing would
be fun, but you've ruined it.
- I don't want this guy's money.
- I don't either.
- I'm not taking it.
- Neither am I.
- Neither am I!
- I'll take it.
- What?
- You said you didn't want it.
You should tell Page the truth.
What for? He's only gonna end up
hurting her anyway.
She's better off with me.
I'll protect her.
From what? From love?
- From pain.
- Love is pain!
Life is pain. You can't protect
anybody. It's always gonna get you.
Sometimes life can also be good.
But you gotta be open, you gotta
take chances, you gotta let go!
What self-help guru moron
taught you that?
Nobody had to teach me.
It's common sense.
And Deepak Chopra is not a moron!
I've seen a lot of crap in my life,
but the way you're cheating her
out of a decent future, it sucks!
Of all the lousy things you've done,
you should be most ashamed of that.
And what you did to me, too.
I don't want to leave that out.
- Here's your money.
- I don't want it.
- Good luck with psycho mom.
- What was that?
- I took care of it.
- How?
I don't want to talk about it.
Let's just get out of here.
So where are we going?
Seattle or San Francisco?
You know, you don't
have to stay with me.
There's plenty of money for you to
set up on your own. You can have it.
Thanks, Mom,
but you're the only person
in this world I even half trust.
What are you doing?
- Turning around.
- Why?
- Promise you won't attack me?
- What is it?
We're travelling at speed.
It would endanger us.
What is it?
Jack turned me down.
So I kinda...
I micked him.
You are the most evil, manipulative...
You're right. I am.
I've just been so afraid of losing you
or of you getting hurt like me.
But I can't protect you.
I just get you hurt
in different, sick ways.
So you might as well get hurt
in your own healthy, normal ways -
ways you come up with on your own
and can't blame me for.
Oh, it's a hug.
I can pull over for a hug.
Don't cry too much or you'll look
like hell when you go back to him.
You should wear the blue dress.
Mom.
Right. Wear whatever you want.
Except what you're wearing.
What are you doing here?
You know what I'm doing here.
You thought I'd want you
after what you did?
You don't? OK, fine.
All right. Wait, wait, OK, fine.
So I still want you.
No kidding.
But don't you ever
cheat on me again. Ever. Ever!
- OK, fine!
- I mean it.
If you see some gorgeous girl giving
you that ''Let's screw around'' look,
just remember
she may be working for me.
All right, fine! But you!
No more conning! No more!
As my wife, you gotta live
a respectable life - chopping cars.
First you gotta help me
with one thing.
No. First you gotta help me.
OK.
You're not gonna fall asleep on me
again, are you?
I feel pretty good about tonight.
I don't wanna go in there.
The bank owns it now.
- There's some stuff left.
- I cleared out everything.
Surprise!
Jane?
- How...?
- My name is Page.
I never realised I could feel
this way again.
That I could be so totally in love
with someone.
Oh, I feel the same way, Stanley.
