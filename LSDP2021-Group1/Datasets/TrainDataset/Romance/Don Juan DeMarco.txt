My name is Don Juan DeMarco...
...son of the great swordsman
Antonio Garibaldi DeMarco...
...tragically killed defending
the honor of my mother...
the beautiful Dona Ines
Santiago y San Martine.
I am the world's greatest lover.
I have made love
to over a thousand women.
I was 21 last Tuesday.
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening, Nicholas.
No woman has ever
left my arms unsatisfied.
Only one has rejected me...
and as fortune would have it...
she's the only one who
has ever mattered.
This is why...
at 21...
I have determined to end
my life.
But first...
one final conquest.
May I?
Actually...
I'm expecting a friend.
He should be here soon.
I will not linger.
I am Don Juan.
That's very funny.
Is there
a costume party at the hotel?
No, I am Don Juan...
directly descended from
the noble Spanish family.
And you seduce women.
No, I never take advantage
of a woman.
I give women pleasure...
if they desire it.
It is of coursethe greatest pleasure
they will ever experience.
There are some women...
fine-featured...
a certain...
texture to the hair,
a curve to the ears, that ....
that sweeps like the turn
of a shell.
these women...
have fingers...
with the same sensitivities
as their legs.
The fingertips have
the same feelings as their feet.
When you touch their knuckles,
it is like passing your hands
along their knees...
and this...
tender, fleshy part
of their finger...
is the same as brushing your hands
around their thighs...
and...
finally...
Every woman is a mystery
to be solved...
but a woman hides nothing
from a true lover.
Her skin color can tell us
how to proceed.
A hue like the blush of a rose,
pink and pale...
and she must be coaxed
to open her petals...
with a warmth like the sun.
The pale and dappled skin
of the redhead
calls for the lust of a wave...
crashing to shore...
so we may stir up what lies beneath...
and bring the foamy delight
of love to the surface.
Although there is...
no metaphor truly describes
making love to a woman,
the closest is playing
a rare musical instrument.
I wonder:
Does a Stradivarius violin feel...
the same rapture
as enraptured as the violinist...
when he coaxes a single,
perfect note from its heart?
Muchas gracias, senorita.
Every true lover knows that
the moment of greatest satisfaction...
comes when ecstasy is long over...
and he beholds before him...
the flowers which has blossomed
beneath his touch.
Sorry I'm late, it was unavoidable.
Hope you went ahead
without me.
Oh well.
Now I must die.
THE BEACHES OF
CANARY ISLANDS
Unmask the Mysteries.
- Hey.
- Evening, Jack.
How you doing, man?
You're putting on
a little weight here.
You know..., you and me been
going to the same bakery.
Sorry to do this to you, Jack.
but this is a job, that
only Super-shrink can handle.
He's a jumper to be
reckoned with, I'm telling you.
What's the costume?
He's Don Juan.
"He wishes to end his life...
gloriously".
He wants us...
to send our finest swordsman...
to do battle with him,
preferably...
"Don Francisco de Silva".
Did he actually say this?
I was up there.
How do you get in this?
Over here.
You sure this is how
Freud started?
What do I know?
I'm just a dumb cop.
You're the shrink.
Where is
Don Francisco de Silva?
I will fight none other.
Where is he?
Don Francisco de Silva...
Left for Mallorca...
on this weekend
but I am his uncle...
Don Octavio de Flores.
This will not do. I must die
at the hands of Don Francisco.
I am Don Juan DeMarco.
You are the Don Juan?
This is correct.
Why, with so many successes,
does the great Don Juan
wish to end his life?
Because there is nothing left
to live for.
Do you mean to say
there is nothing at all?
Not when...
my Dona Ana is everything.
Her name is Dona Ana.
Now you understand
why I must die.
I ask only that it be at the hands
of Don Francisco...
so it may be said I died in glory
from a worthy opponent.
Don Juan, this young woman...
Dona Ana, must be very special.
I would like so much to hear
about her.
Have you never met a woman
who inspires you to love...
until your every sense
is filled with her?
You inhale her...
you taste her...
you see your unborn children
in her eyes...
and you know that your heart
has at last found a home.
Your life begins with her...
and without her
it must surely end.
I have no doubt losing a love like this...
can be very painful, ....
but why lose hope
along with life?
Why lose everything?
You must not forget, my friend...
that the power of your love...
the power of the love of Don Juan
is eternal...
and will not be denied.
I apologize...
for this unmanly display,
Don Octavio.
Please.
I accept.
Bravo.
Bravo.
Good Morning, Doc!
White male, age 21,
brought in on a ten-day paper...
after suicidal gesture...
apparently precipitated by a...
break-up of a relationship.
And the patient...
indicates no previous history
of suicides,
no record of prior hospitalization.
There's no record of anything,
school, jail...
mother, father, parents, nothing.
And this kid is...
"bizzako"...
and is...
severely delusional....
and believes he's somebody else.
Anybody we know?
Name is Don Juan.
- I'm working nights again.
All right, okay.
I'm not kidding.
Let's settle down and...
I'm always the bad boy.
Who wants him?
I do.
- Wait.
- Don't be exasperated.
Wait a minute.
Are you not retiring?
Of course I'm retiring, but I think
it make a hell of a swan song.
This sound like a long term case to me,
the way you described it.
I'm ganna give it to Bill.
Do you have the time?
Wait. Hold on one second.
No offense. I'd like to
discuss this in some detail.
Can you talk about it later?
- Is that alright?
- I look forward to it.
I want this kid.
Be reasonable. Jack...
You're leaving in ten days.
So is the kid.
A delusional patient does not
get cured in a week and a half.
The instant his 10-day paper
expires, he'll be committed...
Then we'll have to transfer
him to Bill anyway.
If this was a year ago...
and I said I'd get this kid out of here
in 10 days, there'd be no doubt.
That's probably true.
So that's not the real reason
you're giving him to Bill.
You've been doing it by the numbers
for months now. You know it.
You're burnt out.
That's why you asked
for early retirement.
You don't need more time
to travel with Marilyn.
Don't make my life harder for me
than it has to be.
How long have I known you?
For 25 years we've been going around like this?
Yes, and during that time you're the
best damn clinician this place has seen.
The best, everybody knows that.
But now it's time...
You know, it's time to get away.
Where are you going?
The pyramids? Oh, it's wonderful.
All that sand...
that sky, those vistas,
you'll have a wonderful time.
I wish you could see your face.
I'm giving him to Bill.
This kid is gonna do
a flamenco number on Bill's head
until it looks like a tortilla...
and it's gonna be on your watch.
Would you...
Would you like to talk about
why you attempted to kill yourself?
You want Don Juan DeMarco,
the world's greatest lover...
to talk to you?
What do you know of great love?
Have you ever loved a woman...
until milk leaked from her
as though she had just
given birth to love itself...
and now must feed it or burst?
Have you ever tasted a woman...
until she believed that
she could be satisfied...
only by consuming the tongue
that had devoured her?
Have you ever loved
a woman so completely...
that the sound
of your voice in her ear...
could cause
her body to shudder
and explode with
such intense pleasure...
that only weeping could
bring her full release?
Where is Don Octavio De Flores?
Who? Who?
My host at this villa.
Villa?
Villa?
Si, villa.
Where is Don Octavio?
You mean Dr. Mickler?
Who?
Why do you think that
Dr. Mickler is...
Don Octavio de Flores?
Why do you think Don Octavio
de Flores is Dr. Mickler?
Hello there, Willy.
How are you?
- Don Octavio de Flores?
- I just said...
- You told him that you were
Don Octavio de Flores?
Oh, Jesus.
You told a delusional patient...
you were a 17th century
Spanish nobleman.
The idea
was to get him in the bucket, right?
Well, he's all yours, Don.
Wait a minute,
did you tell Paul?
You bet i did.
And what did he say?
His exact words were,
"Jack broke it,
let him fix it".
This is very kind of you
to show me the way.
Yeah, come on in.
Dr. Mickler.....
Dr. Mickler...., I've brought...
Mr. Juan here for his appointment.
Thank you, Gloria.
I can return at the end
of the hour and see him back.
- No, it's okay, I'll do it.
- It's really no trouble.
I'll be passing by this door
in exactly one hour.
- Gloria. Thank you.
- I have a break coming up.
- Thanks a lot.
- No problem.
What are you doing
to these girls?
Gosh almighty.
Your people took my mask,
Don Octavio.
They had no right to do that.
I never remove
my mask in public.
Do you understand
the consequences of this?
Not fully, but...
Well, I will be cursed.
I can certainly understand
how that could be upsetting.
Think how you would feel...
if you were made to take off
this mask that you are wearing.
Our masks really
get us in Dutch, don't they?
How long you been wearing yours?
Since I was 16.
I placed the mask on my face
and vowed never to remove it,
on the day I left my mother,
the dark beauty, Dona Ines.
I have some pills here.
I'd like you
and I'd like you to take them,
I think they'll help.
Pills to stop delusions?
Then I am afraid we must take
these pills together...
because...
you are severely deluded.
What delusions have I got?
This fantasy that you are some...
Dr. Mickler.
I'm very disappointed in you,
Don Octavio.
Very disappointed.
Here's the drill.
They can make you take the medication.
That's State law.
You're on what they call
a 10-day paper.
For those 10 days
they can do...
- whatever they think is appropriate.
- I am not deluded.
I am Don Juan.
If you will not medicate me
for these 10 days, I'll prove it to you.
Alright. What if I don't believe
you're Don Juan?
Then I will take your medication...
and you may commit me
for as long as you like.
Do we have an agreement?
Do I have these 10 days
to tell you my story?
Very well.
I was born in Mexico.
It became evident from
a very early age...
that there was something
different about me.
I, myself...
slowly began to realize
that my play
was not like that
of the other boys.
By the time I was 10,
the attraction that females had for me
was becoming of some concern
to my mother.
She presented me to God...
and asked the Lord to save me
before it was too late.
Apparently...
it was too late.
The lessons I learned in church
were not without value, however.
By the time I was 12,
I understood the obligation
the Lord spoke of
to share one's blessings
with those less fortunate.
Vayanse ya de aqui!
Se acabo lo bueno!
One night...
I watched Dona Querida
at the window in her slip.
and noticed, for the first time
how a woman's underclothing...
barely touches her skin...
how it rides on
a cushion of air as she moves...
how the silk floats about
her body, brushing her flesh...
like an angel's wings...
and I understood how a woman
must be touched.
Are you Italian,
Mexican or Spanish?
That is all you have to say?
What is my nationality?
No. Your name is DeMarco.
That's Italian.
You were brought up in Mexico
and whwn you speak English,
you speak it
with a Castilian accent.
My accent has been colored
by my many travels.
Very well, I will answer your question.
I was raised in Mexico.
My father was born in Queens.
His name was Tony DeMarco.
He was Italian. The Dance King of Astoria.
Excuse me.
Your father was a dance king...
here in New York City,
in Astoria?
Si
My father had come to Mexico to work
for a pharmaceutical company.
He had just gotten off the bus
and was walking...
to a nearby hacienda
to inquire about renting a room...
when he first saw my mother.
Both her parents were killed
by a sickness.
My mother was younger and stronger.
and survived.
She took over their plantation.
Sitting in the sunlight
on the veranda...
the bright rays lighting her hair,
she was a vision so beautiful...
that, at first, my father
could not believe his eyes.
It was love at first sight.
They held each other in
the moonlight, kissing and touching
dancing until morning.
I thought you said that your mother
was standing in the sunlight.
That's my father's story.
My mother says it was at night.
They were married
the next week.
My father took
the name Don Antonio...
and became "el patron",
running the coffee plantation.
Their love was like
a perfect prayer.
Even God could not deny it.
I was born exactly
nine months later.
So I said to him "Let me just
see if I understand this".
"You have been exploring
our car for six days now...
"and you still have absolutely no idea
what's wrong with it..."
"why the radiator keeps
running out of fluid?"
"So this means
we get the car back..."
"just as broken as when
we brought it in..."
"Except now you want us to pay
you $430 for the time it took you..."
"not to figure out what's wrong"
Know what he said to me?
"We can keep looking if you want,
Mrs. Mickler...
...but it's $65 an hour".
Well, I don't know, pay the guy.
Pay it?
Where were you just now?
Down in Mexico.
- Jack, I was looking for you.
- A little springtime.
- Excuse me, Nurse.
- You're giving me tulips?
- Grace, I'm sorry.
- Thank you.
- Jack, why are you giving me tulips?
- I want to talk to you about the kid.
- What's the occasion for tulips?
- Listen, the hell of it.
This kid is fantastico.
I'm glad he's meeting
your expectations.
- Jack, there's something I want to discuss.
- I know you do.
- Let me tell you what he did this morning.
- Please, wait! Jack!
When do you intend to start
Don Juan on medication?
He's been here 2 days.
You do intend to
give him medication?
Well, I don't know.
Wait.
He's a delusional patient.
Meds?
If I give him medication...
I'll never get into this world...
that he's in and it's a wonderful world.
- No meds.
- Ok.
- Temporarily.
- Thank you.
- If you do one thing for me.
- What's that?
Well, right now...
Don Juan is having a distracting
influence on the female staff up in his unit..
I mean, officially, in his hacienda...
there are more nurses
on Valium than patients.
- Right.
- Could you do something about that?
I took care of it, my dear man.
Don't worry about it.
Hey, man,
it's time for your shrink.
- Who are you?
- I'm your new nurse, Mr. Compton...
but you can call me "Rocco",
Casanova.
I am not Casanova.
I am Don Juan.
Yeah, right. Come on, man.
Come in.
Doc, Don Juan.
Hi, Rocco.
Thank you.
Well, got a real treat
for you today.
Here are her nipples...
and here's her pubis.
Her lover is kissing the contours
of her bottom...
just where it folds
onto her upper thighs.
Why don't we move on
to something else?
What do you have in mind,
Don Octavio?
Why don't we talk about...
who I am?
Yes, i know who you are.
Who am I?
You're Don Octavio de Flores
the uncle of Don Francisco de Silva.
And where are we, here?
I haven't seen a deed,
but assume the villa is yours.
What would you say to someone
that said to you this is a
psychiatric hospital and that
you're a patient here
and that I am your psychiatrist?
I would say that he has a rather
limited, uncreative way of looking
at the situation.
You want to know if I understand
that this is a mental hospital.
Yes, i understand that.
But then how can I say
that you are Don Octavio...
and I am a guest
at your villa, correct?
By seeing beyond
what is visible to the eye.
Now, there are those, of course, who
do not share my perceptions, it's true.
When I say
that all my women are..
dazzling beauties,
they object.
The nose of this one is too large...
The hips of another, are too wide,
perhaps the breasts...
of a third, they are too small.
But I see these women
for how they truly are:
Glorious...
radiant, spectacular...
and perfect because
I am not limited by my eyesight.
Women react to me the way
that they do, Don Octavio...
because they sense that I search out
the beauty that dwells within them
until it overwhelms
everything else.
And then, they cannot avoid
their desire...
to release that beauty
and envelop me in it.
To answer your question...
I see as clear as day that this...
that this great edifice
in which we find ourselves...
is your villa,
it is your home...
and as far for you,
Don Octavio de Flores,
you are a great lover
like myself...
even though you may
have lost your way...
and your accent.
Shall I continue?
Very well.
Back to Mexico.
My mother, God bless her,
does not give up easily.
When i was 16,
she made one last attempt
to instill Christian values in me...
by finding me a tutor.
My mother's judgement
left something to be desired.
Dona Julia was 23 and married,
the faithful and devoted wife
of Don Alfonso...
a man of 50.
It was no secret that Dona Julia,
would have been much better served by...
two men of 25.
"Glorify God in your body
and your spirit...
which are God's"
My feelings consumed me
day and night.
I felt within me...
a torment...
a burning wound...
a yearning...
combined with the most
indescribable bliss...
but what was it?
And you had no idea what it was?
Well, I had an idea, but...
nothing definite.
My father,
understanding that manhood
was nearly upon me,
began to teach me how
to use my sword.
So a lot of sword fighting
went on when you were growing up?
It was a small and isolated town
that resisted modern technology.
Advance.
Lunge.
I notice that the smile...
on Dona Julia's face was gone.
It had been replaced by a sadness
even sweeter than the smile.
I sensed that Dona Julia was
having a struggle within her....
and my own situation was becoming
no less difficult.
I could only think of
Dona Julia.
To keep myself from going mad...
I turned into a metaphysician.
I considered the meaning
of the truth...
of being...
and God.
I thought of the timetable
for the sun's demise...
and then I thought
of Dona Julia's eyes.
I never will consent.
I never will consent.
I never will consent.
But somehow,
she consented.
She did.
Then suddenly i was hit
with a revelation:
The way a woman's body is made,
the way a man's body responds to it,
the fire burning in my loins,
the intense desire
to merge as one...
it all came together...
in one brilliant flash.
There are only four questions
of value in life, Don Octavio.
What is sacred?
Of what is the spirit made?
What is worth living for?
And what is worth dying for?
The answer to each is the same.
Only love.
Dona Julia...
was my first love.
Well,
I see our time is up.
The mask?
Obsessive compulsive disorder...
with eroto-manic features.
Confirm...
delusional disorder.
Confirm depression with...
obsessional features.
Possible hysterical personality.
I take it you want to go upstairs.
What gave you that idea?
Why are you listening
to opera?
You hate opera.
You have very...
very beautiful eyes.
Come here.
You know, I have to go upstairs and...
take my calcium so my bones don't
break into little pieces...
my aspirin, so my heart
doesn't clog up...
my Metamucil, so I don't get
colon cancer...
and, of course, my estrogen
to convince my body...
that I'm still 23.
Come here.
What the hell are you doing in there?
Rain check?
No, no.
I was thinking about
our adolescence.
There isn't any
transitional battleground left
for us anymore.
I just feel as thought
we've surrendered our lives to
the momentum of mediocrity.
What happened
to all the celestial fire...
that used to light our way?
Oh, Jack, no. Listen, honey.
You know all those fires
are a lot of trouble.
They caused a lot of trouble,
are hard to control, they flare up
they burn a lot of energy...
and then they suddenly die.
I want to tell you something.
That's bullshit because...
No, it's not bullshit.
A good, steady, warm, glow...
you know, that does the trick
over the long run.
No fire...
No heat.
No heat, No life.
- That's the equation.
- No, no Jack.
May I assume that...
the upshot of all this is that you will not
be easing gracefully into retirement?
Goddamn right, baby.
What am I going to retire from?
Life?
Listen. We haven't started yet.
This is a 12-rounder,
and this is the third round...
and you and I are going to go
out of here like Halley's comet.
Listen to me. What is going on?
You've been funny lately.
I don't know.
Come on, you gotta me, Jack.
It's no secret.
I don't know.
I've been feeling...
I've been treating this
kid lately.
He thinks he's Don Juan
and he's got a costume.
He's got a sword and a mask and...
And so who is he really?
I don't know.
But he's...
he's getting to me.
Goddamn. you're a great broad,
really.
I know.
This is going to be a good one.
- Oh, Jesus, not there, honey.
- Wait, I'm sorry.
Damn, What is that?
Your hair comb?
- I'm on my hair clasp. It's got teeth!
- I don't want to be injured here.
At every instant we fell into
each other's arms.
Time stopped
for those four months.
There was neither day or night,
just my love and hers.
As for Don Alfonso...
he spent so much time away handling
the details of his trading business,
that I was practically able
to live in Dona Julia's house.
I truly believed I had found
everlasting paradise...
until one night...
Dona Julia...
my sweet bird!
Where is he?
- Where have you hidden him?
- For God sakes, Don Alfonso...
What sort of drunken fit
has seized you?
How dare you suspect me!
Me, who the thought
of infidelity would surely kill.
Yes, search...
and search and search.
Heap insult on insult.
You ungrateful, purgerous,
barbarous man.
Are you quite satisfied now?
I will kill this man.
My sword.
Where is my sword?
He's going to kill me.
He's going to kill me.
Quick. Go out the garden gate.
I will kill you!
It was the last I was ever to see
of my tutor...
the lovely Dona Julia.
In great remorse, she left that night
and was never to be heard of again.
Don Alfonso
was humiliated
that he had been cuckolded
by a 16-year old boy...
so to retaliate,
he announced publicly...
that he and my mother had been
having an affair for many years.
It was, of course,
a bold-faced and terrible lie.
My father was quick
to defend my mother's virtue.
I have no doubt...
my father would've prevailed...
were it not
for one fatal mistake.
He looked up
at my mother's eyes...
and it was too late.
Antonio...
No, Juan!
I will lose them both!
You have killed my father.
Now you must kill me.
Forgive me, father.
Of course i forgive you.
You are my son.
And so it was that my father...
the great swordsman
Don Antonio...
died in my mother's arms...
as our tears fell upon him.
That evening,
to hide my shame forever,
I placed a mask
upon my face...
and vowed never to remove it
in the presence of another.
My father left me too soon.
Don Octavio.
I never had the chance...
Oh, great.
- Are you Dr. Mickler?
- That's right.
Sign here.
Would you just hold that for a sec?
Hello, dear.
So, Jack,
what's the occasion?
Excuse me, madam.
You're the occasion.
No, really. Are you sure...
there's no...
Beautiful.
Excuse me, ma'am.
Buenos dias, El capitan.
Where's Rocco?
He has moved to Madrid.
- Madrid?
- Si.
- Spain?
- Si
Then he feels so guilty,
he feels so overcome with shame...
that he puts on this mask...
and he vows never...
to take his mask off again
as long as he lives.
Now, is that
a perfect myth or not?
It's wonderful.
It's a wonderful story.
You know, Jack, this kid is remarkable.
You're right.
You're right.
It's like a Greek myth.
It's exactly like a Greek myth.
The son becomes potent...
sexually active...
Leads to the destruction of his father,
who he replaces. As, of course, he must...
He must some day, to become a man
but the guilt...
of replacing the man who loves him
and gave him life is too great.
It's enormous. So he must
hide it by wearing a mask.
It's time to put the kid on meds, Jack.
You want to drive this kid nuts?
Fill him full of...
anti-psychotic chemicals...
and in 48 hours
you'll have a nut case
you are not ever going to forget
for the rest of your life.
Jack, he is a schizophrenic.
He is not Don Juan.
How do you know
he's not Don Juan?
I've been with the kid. I know.
Has he ever told you, Jack,
in any of his sessions...
- I haven't...
- Has he mentioned it?
that he's been living
with his grandmother
in Queens?
Has he ever told you?
....any details like that.
I got a call about an hour ago
from the department.
Now, please, Jack...
put the boy on medication.
- Paul, you don't understand...
- Jack!
Please!
Take it easy. He is your patient.
You got five days.
You got five days.
I am pissed off at you.
And don't forget
we're barbecuing Saturday.
Really pissed off.
Mrs. DeMarco?
Yes. This is Dr. Mickler. Remember?
We spoke on the phone
about your grandson.
I want to have a...
Dona Ana.
she's all he talks about.
He waits for the mailman every day
like he's delivering cannoli.
The boy's convinced
he's found his one true love.
He's worse than his father,
Tony
Tony,
the Dance King of Astoria.
This is his father?
He won a prize for dancing?
You never heard of him?
Did his father sell pharmaceuticals?
Tony couldn't sell a boat
to a drowning man.
He worked
for a dry cleaning concern.
He did drapes and sofas.
Is his father still alive?
Didn't Johnny tell you anything?
Tony died...
in a terrible car crash.
It was five years ago.
In Mexico.
In Phoenix.
They never lived in Mexico?
Never.
- Where is his mother?
- I couldn't tell you.
We were never what
you might call close.
Mrs. DeMarco, How often did
you see your grandson...
when he was growing up?
Only once.
Johnny was six.
Do you mean that
that's the only time...
you saw Johnny
in your entire life?
Until three months ago.
I open the door...
and there was Zorro.
Chelsea Stoker.
I just seen your grandmother and
she's got the bizarre impression
that your name is
John Arnold DeMarco...
that you grew up
in Phoenix, Arizona...
and that your father
died in a car crash.
Interesting fantasy.
But I suppose
if it makes her happy...
it is harmless enough.
She told me your father
worked in....
a dry cleaning establishment.
You want me to tell you some story like my
grandmother's so you will think I am sane.
If that is what it takes to get out of
this place. I will be happy to do it.
But there is a rumor that you are
supposed to be a psychiatrist.
I've heard that rumor, too.
Can you not tell when you meet
a woman who's completely insane?
Are you saying that your grandmother
made this all up?
In so many words, yes.
She hated my mother.
It's not unusual because my
grandmother hated everybody.
So we stayed as far away from her
as possible.
- In Phoenix, Arizona.
- In Mexico.
You mean you never lived
in Phoenix, Arizona?
No, I never lived
in Phoenix, Arizona.
What about
your father's death?
I have told you how my father died,
Don Octavio.
Her name is Chel--
I'm not going to take it away.
I just want to point out
her name is Chelsea Stoker.
They never use
their real names.
She is really my Dona Ana.
She is trying to teach me a lesson.
You know, I...
I once treated a young man,
about your age...
and he fell in love oddly enough,
with a girl on a poster.
He was very insecure about women...
And..
and he tried
to contact her.
He must have called...
the magazine 100 times...
till finally somebody
at the magazine...
took pity on him
and gave him her number.
So he called her.
They had a one-minute conversation
and she let him know...
she never wanted to speak
to him again.
And then what happened?
He tried to kill himself
is what happened.
Dona Ana is real, Don Octavio.
Want to hear about her?
I suppose so.
Shortly after
the death of my father...
my mother decided that it would be
the best to send me to Cadiz...
as though a voyage at sea
would purify me.
She herself had determined
to take her vows...
at the convent of Santa Maria,
where she is a nun to this day.
I was being sent forth...
Like a dove of promise.
Of course, what my mother never
knew was that the ship...
was run by scoundrels.
Instead of Cadiz...
they set sail...
for an obscure
Arabian Sultanate,
where the passengers were
immediately sold into slavery.
You were sold
into slavery in a...
- sultan's kingdom?
- That's correct.
I was purchased...
by one of four wives of a sultan
and led off by her eunuch.
I had no idea why I was made
to dress as a female.
my mask had been replaced
by a mask of another sort...
and so I supposed I was keeping
the vow I made to hide my face.
The Sultan had a harem...
of fifteen hundred young women...
so the demands he placed on
his wives were relatively minor.
I was presented to the Sultana.
I still did not understand why
I was required to be in drag.
You may rise.
And you my go.
You may stay.
Slowly...
I began to develop a theory...
why I was brought
to the Sultana...
But, i still loved Dona Julia.
I am sorry.
I love another.
Undress!
Kill me if you must.
I am prepared to die,
for I cannot go on living...
knowing that I defiled
the memory of the woman...
who brought my manhood alive
and made it sing.
It sings?
I was prepared
to lose my life...
rather than debase
my love.
How could I be unfaithful
to my dear Dona Julia...
who had nearly given up
her life to love me?
How could I sleep
with another woman...
after giving
myself, body and soul...
to sweet Dona Julia?
How could I forsake
the purity of love...
I had with my flower,
Dona Julia?
Actually, I was surprised at how
easy the past can be overcome.
You know, my friend, until this afternoon
I have always believed that a man
could love only one woman.
I've been badly misled.
It's absolutely incredible...
to me just a few hours ago Dona Julia
was the only woman who existed...
and now...
there is the magnificent
Sultana Gulbeyaz.
- What a glorious body, breast...
Will you please shut up?
Suddenly...
I was truck by the danger
of my situation.
I prayed they'd found
a place to hide me...
where I wouldn't be discovered
by the sultan.
As fortune would have it...
their solution was a
brilliant one.
It was God's canvas...
in all its natural beauty.
For the next 2 years...
my days were
spent with the Sultana
And yours nights?
My nights were spent with the 1500
young women of the Sultan's harem.
Come.
Come to me, my little cockatoo.
At the end of 2 years,
I noticed...
I didn't have the same
enthusiasm as before.
This could be a problem.
You may rise,
my little dove.
Oh, well...
all good things
must come to an end.
Gulbeyaz,
sensing the danger
to us both,
arranged for me
to depart within the hour.
I had learned to love
in 1000 ways,
each one is a lesson
in the soul of a woman.
I knew i would miss
every one of them.
They'd stolen my spirit...
and infused me with joy,
like a May day breaking.
I would...
I would like to hear this in
complete detail...
but there's something that
i must do now...
so I wonder if we could
continue this tomorrow.
Of course.
Thank you.
Hasta manana.
You're home early.
How would you feel
about coming upstairs?
Ok. Go!
Ok. Wait a sec.
Over here now.
What happened?
- You're no good at all.
- I am too good. I've got 3. Look.
- I got three.
- Well...
- When is my turn?
- I got five.
I know. You're better than me.
- Did you get it?
- Yes!
Last but not least, the moment
we've all been waiting for....
Don Juan DeMarco.
In respect to that,
I want to say that...
I've got a meeting with the kid...
later on today and I think it might
very well be the definitive meeting.
Jack, this isn't a treatment conference.
This is a disposition conference.
We have to know what to do with this kid
on Monday when his 10-day paper expires.
Do we ask the judge
to commit him?
Do we let him go?
What?
I won't know until I have
the meeting with the kid.
He's a suicidal patient.
He's not suicidal.
It was a call for help.
You're not suggesting
that we let him go, are you?
- No, I'm not suggesting that.
- Alright.
First thing Monday we have to get
the judge over here for a hearing.
Also on Monday we'll have to
transfer him to another therapist
because that's your last day, Jack.
Bill?
You think you're up to it?
If he's on medication, I could.
He'll be on medication.
Alright. I'll give him...
I don't know., A hundred milligrams
of Mellzac, Q.I.D
And Bill can begin to decrease it
once his anxiety lessens about
being attacked...
- by his patients.
- Could you tell him to stop?
And if he refuses?
Do we restrain him
and give it by injection?
I'll get him to take the medication,
for Christ's sake.
What's the big concern here?
He hasn't been assaultive.
Anyway, I've got to go.
No, no. There's one other
piece of business.
Okay, we're ready.
For he's
A jolly good fellow...
For he's
A jolly good fellow...
For he's
A jolly good fellow...
Which nobody can deny!
"Today is the first day
of the rest of your life".
Come in.
I am Dona Ines,
the mother of
Don Juan DeMarco..
May I come in, Don Octavio?
Ah, Please.
I came as soon as the
archdiocese de Mexico City
told me that my son had called them.
What exactly is wrong with him?
I'm very grateful, Sister,
that you've come...
at this strange moment in time...
because there is so much
crucial information
that I need in order to help
your son.
How can I be of help?
For instance, is it a fact
that your son grew up...
with you and your husband
in Mexico in a small town?
San Luis Coatzalcoalcos.
It's not very far from "Izucar de Matamoros"..
Have you heard of it?
Well, not many have.
It's very small
You know, In order to help your son
I have to have some information.
I need to know about
Don Alfonso,
about his father, Don Antonio,
and about your relationship
with both of them.
I think it would be best if you would
discuss these matters directly with my son.
My vows to God
do not allow me to talk...
about certain aspects
of my past.
I don't think, Sister...
I'm making myself clear.
I've been to see
your son's grandmother.
and she tells me that
neither you nor your son...
have ever lived in Mexico.
She said that you met Tony
in Queens, New York,
and until recently
she said she only saw her
grandson once in her life,
when she was in Phoenix, Arizona.
She also said that 5 years ago...
that your husband died in a car crash.
Now, in addition...
I'm sorry,
but you must understand, Sister,
that i need to know the truth.
The truth is inside you,
Don Octavio.
I cannot help you find that.
Isn't she exactly
as I described her, Don Octavio?
Yeah.
Exactly.
Dona Julia has become
a nun at the same convent.
So it seems.
I told my mother could go back today,
but I'll miss her.
She really has a way of putting
me in touch with what's real.
Why are you so certain...
that your mother was not having
an affair with Don Alfonso?
My mother was not
having an affair.
Well, I think you can understand how
the thought might have occurred to me,
when you told me
how your father died.
It's never been clear
to me what...
what your mother meant when she
cried out: "I'll lose both of them!"
Did she mean
both her husband and her son?...
Or both of her lovers?
My mother...
was not having an affair.
Do you understand why
it's necessary...
Stop!
You don't think I know what's going on
with you, Don Octavio? but I do. You need me...
for a transfusion because your
own blood has become dust
and clogged your heart.
Your need for reality...
Your need for a world
where love is flawed...
will continue to choke your veins
until all the life is gone.
My perfect world is no less real
than yours, Don Octavio.
It is only in my world
that you can breathe.
Isn't it?
Isn't it?
Yeah
You're right. My...
world is...
not perfect.
What is this thing
that happens with age?
Why does everyone
want to pervert love
and suck it bone-dry
of all its glory?
Why do you bother
to call it love anymore?
This will be our...
last session.
I'm retiring on Monday.
Then I'll tell you about Dona Ana.
and you will decide
if I should be set free.
On the second day,
after i left the Sultana,
our ship was caught
in a typhoon.
I alone survived.
After days drifting at sea,
I found myself
on the island of Eros.
She was 17...
and Nature's bride,
fresh and fair,
and unacquainted with
the miracle of physical love.
Her beauty was not made
of shapes and forms,
but shined from within,
like a star.
There are those who do not believe
that a single soul...
born in heaven...
can split into twin spirits
and shoot,
like falling stars to earth,
where over oceans
and continents
their magnetic forces
will finally
unite them back into one.
But how else to explain
love at first sight?
We were convinced
that there was no other life
beneath the sky but ours.
We believed...
that we would never die.
You must promise me
that we'll be together
for all time,
that we'll live here on this beach...
always...
and that should circumstance
ever separate us,
it is here we will come...
to wait all eternity...
for the other to return.
I love you.
Promise me.
I promise.
One day,
I asked her to be mine.
I love you too much,
but i cannot love you any less.
It's of no great consequence, but...
will you be wearing your mask
throughout our lives together?
I have sworn to do so.
Then I ask only that you tell me
what led you to make such a vow.
I related the sad tale
of my Dona Julia...
never guessing for a moment...
that my sweet Dona Ana believed
I had saved myself for her...
as she had for me.
Very well, my love.
I will accept that I am not the first...
if you'll tell me,
with the same honesty,
how many others
there have been.
This would have been a very good time
for me to lie, but truth...
is a terrible habit.
Including you,
there have been
exactly ...
one...
thousand five hundred and two.
I could see...
that this was a sum
substantially greater...
that the one she had in mind,
and not easy for her to assimilate,
try as she might.
As her pain struck at my heart
like a dagger,
I begged to be forgiven.
I removed my mask
as a gesture of remorse
but my it was to no avail.
To hide her humiliation,
she took off the mask
and left me forever.
So my adventures came to an end,
and with them the chance that
one day, like my father,
I would die in the arms
of the woman I loved.
Who am i?
Sit down.
You...
are Don...
Juan...
DeMarco,
the greatest lover
the world has ever known.
And you, my friend,...
who are you?
Who am i?
I am Don Octavio de Flores,
married to the beautiful
Dona Lucita,
the light of my life.
And you, my friend...
you have seen through
all of my masks.
Here's your water, Doctor.
Thank you.
You said that you believed,
Don Octavio.
I believe that you are Don Juan,
but there are
a lot of people that don't.
Then I'll do as you ask,
my friend.
Vamos!
You're retiring on Monday.
So, what are we going to do?
We're going to get airborne.
kid, I'll tell you that.
I'm trying to tell you something:
I like it here.
- I like my garden.
- We need to be a flight of eagles.
I don't see myself
in that picture.
What's the matter with you?
What are you talking about?
- I don't know.
- I need to find out who you are.
Jack, you know who I am.
Who's brought you coffee
for the last 32 years?
Listen, I know a lot about dirty coffee
cups and I know a lot of facts,
but I need to know all
about you.
What do you wanna know?
I want to know...
What your hopes
and your dreams are
that got lost along the way
while I was thinking
about myself.
What's so funny?
Thought you'd never ask.
- Hey, Doc.
- Good morning.
Do you understand
why you're here, young man?
Okay, then.
I'd like for you to tell me a little about
yourself, where you grew up?...
what made you want
to kill yourself? how you feel now?
I was born in...
in Queens.
Me and my parents
moved to Phoenix
when I was a kid.
I hated it.
When I was sixteen,
my father was killed in a...
car accident just outside of town.
My mother...
she'd been having these affairs
and my father knew.
Anyway, she felt so guilty,
she decided to become a nun.
So, within three weeks
of my father's death,
she was in a convent
somewhere in Mexico.
And there I was.
I had nowhere to go.
I didn't know what to do.
So, one day, I was...
looking at this magazine,
and there was a centerfold,
And I knew she wouldn't
go for me,
the way that I was,
you know, so I...
I'd been reading a book,
this book,
and...
I decided to become Don Juan.
So,
I called up the magazine.
They wouldn't help me.
They wouldn't give me any information, so...
So, I was about to give up and...
one day I reached this woman
who worked there.
I think she was a temp,
or something....
The woman took pity on me
and she gave me the girl's number.
So I called her up.
I said that we were
meant to be together and...
she called me a creep
and then she hung up.
I just decided
that my life was over, so I...
was going to kill myself.
Or at least I was going to make
people believe that I would kill myself
kill myself so I could get some
attention, or something.
I never really had any intention
of killing myself.
Thank you.
This has been very helpful.
Someone will show you
back to your room now.
Doctors,
this seems like
a perfectly normal kid to me.
I've had a couple of...
centerfold fantasies myself...
and I'm certainly not going to...
commit him to a mental institution
for his.
Your Honor,
I.... I think his behavior...
Let him go.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
As his doctor,
I concur with your views.
I've spent more time
with him than you have!
I will call you later
and thank God for medication.
Have a wonderful vacation.
Bill, Nurse. As head of
the hospital, let me speak.
My name...
is Don Octavio de Flores.
I am the world's greatest
psychiatrist.
I have cured
over a thousand patients.
Their faces linger in my memory
like summer days.
But none more so than
Don Juan DeMarco.
So it was not so insane
that we all found ourselves...
on an airplane,
flying to the island of Eros.
It was like...
the Garden before the Fall.
Everything seemed possible.
How does our fable end?
His Dona Ana,
his centerfold,...
was she...
waiting all eternity on the beach
for him to return,
as they'd promised each other?
Why not?
Sadly, I must report...
that the last patient I ever treated,
the great lover,
Don Juan DeMarco,
suffered from a romanticism...
which was completely incurable.
And even worse...
highly
contagious.
