-
- Are we on?
Hello.
When? Thank you.
Yes. I'll tell him.
Sir.
He's gone.
Contact family members...
the various corporate boards...
and business interests.
Yes, sir.
Sir, I-
I am so sorry
for your loss.
Am I speakin'
to a Theophilus Hamilton of Birmingham?
Sir? Yes, sir. This is he.
Name's Howard Stevens.
You can call me Red.
I need a lawyer for a few
business ideas I have...
a few still
in the dream stage.
-
-  Though the skies may weep...
the Bible assures us that
precious in the sight of the Lord...
is the death ofhis saints.
I wonder who the old man
negotiated with for the rain.
Well, it's a sure bet
he's laughin'...
watchin' us get soaked.
Yeah, well,
now it's his turn.
There's not a person here
whose life, in some way...
has not been touched
by Howard ''Red'' Stevens.
Red often quoted
Malcolm Muggeridge...
saying that, ''Every happening,
great or small...
''is a parable by which
God speaks to us...
and the art oflife
is to get the message. ''
May the message of Red Stevens
continue in the hearts of those he leaves behind.
- What are you doing? You're gonna get all wet.
-  Bill.
Even though Dad moved his corporate offices
from Texas many years ago...
for tax reasons...
he always said he wanted
to be buried under Texas soil.
Is that him?
That's him.
Mom.
-  You're late.
- For what?
-
-  Give me some of that!
Settle down over there.
Good morning.
Before we start,
I'd like to say how much Red...
meant to me personally.
As you know, we started out
as business partners...
and we ended up
as friends.
I am deeply grieved
by his passing.
Yes, well, that's very nice.
Now, may we proceed?
Red's will
is in his own words...
still, every bit
as legal and binding-
Blah, blah, blah.
''And, so,
my eldest son, Bill...
I leave my company,
Panhandle Oil and Gas. ''
- Currently worth $600 million.
-
''However, Bill, since you had
zero interest in my company while I was alive...
''I don't imagine that will
change much after my death.
Therefore, the board
will maintain control.''
Excuse me, but my client would like
to explore all of his options.
Your client
has no more options.
One of those instructions
Mr. Hamilton skipped over...
is Red's desire that each of you vacate
after receiving your portion of the estate.
- As in, leave the room.
- What the- She can't talk to me like that.
- Well, do something.
- You can go now, Mr. Stevens.
- What-All right. Fine. Fine.
-  We should really go.
I have never been so humiliated.
Did you see that old man
talkin'to me that way?
And you guys just sat there
and said absolutely nothin'.
That's it?
- A cow farm?
- A 10,000-acre cow farm.
Well, what's that worth anyway?
Ruth, come on.
Come here.
What exactly do we get?
A place for you
to take your mistress.
Come on, Yuth.
Let me explain.
- I want to see everything. Full disclosure.
- Come on, Jack. Let's go.
- Good day, Mr. Stevens.
- You said you had a strategy.
- This is a long way from over.
- You said it was a slam dunk!
-
- ''To Sarah, widow of my late son,
Jay Howard Stevens...
''I am truly sorry
for the events of the past.
''Please know thatJay's death
represents the greatest tragedy...
''I have ever experienced.
''I leave you control of my Myers Park estate
where you now reside...
- ''and a managed trust for
expenses as long as you live.
- There we go.
''Since your choice
of male companionship is vast and varied...
the deed and title for the house
will remain under the control of my trustees. ''
- Good day, Mr. Hamilton.
- Good day.
It's amazing just how far
the fruit can fall from the tree.
And still roll
a great distance.
Nice of you to show up.
You're in time for nothin'.
Let's go.
Jason.
How do you know
my name?
It's my business to know everyone
named in your grandfather's will.
Let's cut the B.S., 'cause
I know what he left me- nothing.
Walk away-you'll never know,
will you?
-  Jason?
-
So, what's in the box?
Your inheritance.
Have a seat.
Does the box or the seal appear to have been
tampered with in any way?
No.
Then therefore
witness this day...
that I am
breaking the seal...
affixed in my presence
by Red himself.
-  Miss Hastings.
- Yes, sir.
- Are we on?
-  Yes, we are.
Mmm. Well, then,
if you're watching this...
I must be dead.
That's a strange concept.
How was my funeral?
Well attended?
I hope it rained.
Hamilton, Miss Hastings...
I hope you're having
a better day than I am.
If you've just been
with my family, I doubt it.
Jason, I made a lot
of mistakes with our family...
but you're the one
I think I hurt the most.
The only way I can make it up to you
is to not give you anything.
I knew it.
What I mean by that is that
I'm not giving you anything just yet.
So sit back down there.
I've been thinking about this
for a long time.
How can I give you something and not have it
ruin you like your uncles and aunts?
Even some of their kids.
So I want to give you a gift-
a series of gifts...
leading up to, well...
I wanna call it
''the ultimate gift.''
Now,you fail in any way,
it's over.
You get nothing.
And everything you do
must be to Mr. Hamilton's satisfaction.
You might wanna make friends with him
sooner than later.
This is a voice-activated
Conversay.
It allows two-way communication
between our office and you.
And you can also replay
Red's messages on it if you need to.
-  Sir.
- Ah, good.
There's a flight to Houston
tomorrow at 7:00 a.m.
As in morning, 7.'00 a.m.?
Yes. That 7:00 a.m.
- For what?
- You have until then to accept.
- Why do I have to go?
- You'll find out when you get there.
- This is whacked.
- You might wanna rethink that.
What could he possibly give me
that he hasn't already taken away?
Huh? Screw him.
Screw both of you.
-
- Well.
How was your day?
I'm not sure.
What do you mean?
My grandfather may have
left me something.
- Yeah?
- I'm just trying to figure it out.
- You mean it's not cash?
- I don't know.
Don't know?
If I want to play into his little power trip,
I gotta go pick it up.
- Where?
- Texas.
- Yech.
- You know what? I'm not going.
Well, aren't you
at least curious?
What if it's... gold?
He ruined my life.
My best revenge
is to just...
ignore him.
Besides,
I've got a trust fund.
Worst-case scenario-
I'll live off my mom.
I don't need his money.
Yeah, but one can always use
some extra walking-around money.
Not if I have
to sell my soul.
But, if you had to, at least try to get
as much out of him as you can.
My gosh. What if you actually
had to get a job sometime?
-
-
Police escort-sorta.
-
-
Uh, ladies and gentlemen...
from the flight deck, we have a very full flight
to Houston this morning.
-
-  Uh, excuse me, sir.
Can I- Can I see
your boarding pass again?
Thank you.
Yeah. See, this is, uh-
I'm sorry. This is for coach.
Nah. That's impossible.
- No. It's, uh, 3 2B.
- Well, change it.
We can't- Please.
We can't- No.
Thanks a lot.
We can't change it.
It's a ''Q'' fare. You can't upgrade.
- So, can we-
- Do you have any idea who I am?
I- I know exactly
who you are.
You're the guy in Seat 3 2B. Here we go.
-
-
Conversay to Jason Stevens.
-
-  Hello, Jason.
What is this, one of those things
Aunt Martha had to wear?
I see you're at the, uh,
Houston airport.
Uh, Baggage Claim.
-
- You got a problem?
You don't look like you've worked
a day in your life.
Great.
The Amazing Kreskin.
I'm don't know what I'm supposed to be doing,
because no one's been-
Hey! Hey!
I'm Gus.
I'm your ride. Get in.
I'm sorry about
your grandfather's passin'.
He was some man.
He loved to work.
The man just loved
hard work.
Yight. Mind if I smoke?
Ah, it's a free country.
Can you stop
at the next convenience store?
- Convenience store?
- Please.
The last store was
about 50 miles back.
We've been on my property
for the last 30 minutes or so.
Well, seein' as how
you're Red's grandson...
you'll stay in the main house
with us.
I know it ain't much.
The little lady just wanted a modest place.
Dinner's in an hour.
Breakfast at 5:00.
Uh, Gus?
- Aren't you forgetting something?
- I don't think so. Shoot.
- The gift.
-
So this is hell.
Hey, city boy.
Breakfast is over.
Don't you have some kind
of gizmo to wake you up?
Beat it.
-
-
- Good morning.
- What is your problem!
Time to get to work.
The sun'll be up soon.
-
- Let's go!
Your granddad and I
started out together...
wildcattin' oil wells
down in Louisiana.
Made some money.
We each bought cattle spreads...
as a hedge against
the oil runnin' out.
Of course,
he really made it.
- Nice to own your own little piece ofTexas, right?
- Yight.
Just from there-
eight feet
from the center.
What?
Lunch will be sent
'round about 11:00.
Well, how far
am I supposed to go?
Don't worry.
You'll run out of posts
before you run out ofTexas.
I wish I had a dollar
for every fence post I've ever set.
Matter of fact, I do.
-
-
Hey.
What do you think?
No! Hey!
Aw! Come on, man!
So, I'm dying to know. What did you get?
Uh, it's complicated,
but it involves land...
building materials
and slave labor.
They're giving you
a shopping mall?
Not exactly.
So it must be the land, right?
They're giving that to you?
- Uh, land's got a lot to do with it, yeah.
- You don't sound too sure.
Well, whatever it is, I gotta survive
this geriatric cowboy...
until he gives it to me
or when I get back or-
or when I'm finished.
Finish what?
You know what?
Let me get back to you, okay?
Jason, what are you-
So that's it.
Yeah.
Let's go.
I'm not done.
Work's never done
on a ranch.
All right. Whatever.
You know, you do any work
like you just did...
you can do anything.
Now, aren't you
forgettin' something?
- I don't think so. Shoot.
- The gift.
I came here to pick up a gift.
Yemember?
That was the gift?
I do manual labor
for a month...
and you're trying to tell me
it was a favor- to me.
- The gift of work.
- Wow.
- Congratulations.
- Look, Hamilton.
Just tell me what
my total inheritance is. I'm over this.
Where are you going?
Where is he going?
Can you tell him
to come back, please?
Mr. Hamilton.
Mr. Hamilton.
-
- Hey.
Mr. Hamilton, sir.
Please.
I think it's only fair I know the amount
of money we're dealing with here. Don't you?
I've been gone for a month.
Just tell me-
What do I have to do? What is it?
Red said,
''a series of gifts.''
But let me add
a personal note.
I, too, think
this is a waste of time.
But it will end shortly,
because you are going to fail.
I expect you to fail
and to fail miserably.
Now, if you do want
to continue...
make an appointment
with Miss Hastings.
Okay. Look. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Mr. Hamilton.
I've been acting like a moron
about this whole thing, and I'm sorry.
And now I- I see exactly
what you and Red have in store for me...
and I think
it's exceedingly beneficial.
So, what's the next gift?
You'll know.
Howdy.
Wait. Wait.
That's an $8,000
paint job!
You don't begin to live
until you've lost everything.
Heck, I've lost everything
three or four times.
It's the perfect place
to start.
Now, for most
of your adult life...
you have been
the life of the party...
and an easy touch
for a lot of weak hangers-on.
Now let's see who
your real friends are.
I was at your funeral, and there wasn't
a single person there...
who wasn't on your payroll or didn't
have something to gain from your death.
What exactly is he
asking me to do?
He wants you to come back
at the end of the month...
with one true friend.
Thank you.
- And how were the lobster tails?
- It was fine, thanks.
The lady was enjoying
the Montrachet.
And sir, the Margaux.
I hope it met
your expectations.
It was terrific.
Thank you.
We don't get too many requests
for the '7 8.
It's a bit too pricey
for some of our patrons.
I'll just leave this
with you then.
Caitlin, where do you
see our relationship?
- What are you asking me, Jason Stevens?
-Just thinking.
How long have we
been going out?
Uh, an appropriate
amount of time.
- Long enough.
- See? My thoughts exactly.
I was thinking that maybe
it's time to take us... more seriously.
Yes?
But there's something
I want to ask you first.
Jason, if you're talking about a prenup,
isn't that sort of passé?
Well, see, I'm in-
I was thinking-
Excuse me, sir.
The charge card company
declined the charge.
That's impossible. I don't have a credit limit.
Just run it through again.
It's always our practice
to run it through again...
but they declined.
Okay.
So, I was thinking, um...
well, maybe, it'd be a good time
for me to move in with you.
Uh, you move in with me?
Why? Half my wardrobe's at your penthouse.
Just for a change of scenery.
Besides, I'm remodeling my place.
A remodel? But-Who's your designer?
I know everyone in town.
I should've said
I'm beginning to remodel.
I've only really started
with the demolition.
I'm sorry, sir.
Your bank is on the line.
They'd really like
to speak with you. I must insist.
Look, guys. I'm having
a little bit of a setback.
It's nothing that can't be fixed.
All right?
-
- Sweetie, I'm switching accounts right now...
and I'm...
temporarily out of money.
Is there a way
you could pay for this?
Jason, you're, um-
You're, uh...
asking me
to pay the bill?
- It's-
-
What?
Yo, dude,
I'm rollin' over.
What do you mean
I can't?
I have been there for you
countless times.
You owe me. That's it.
Bottom line.
Who was the one who loaned you
I could come up with a better excuse
when I was 12 years old.
All I need is a place to sleep.
I don't get what the problem is.
You can let me spend the night.
One night. Hello?
Sorry. Your service has been disconnected.
- Can I help you? Yeah, shut up.
- No. Nothing, thanks.
Jason.
Um- Uh,
what a surprise.
- Mom, you're never gonna believe this.
- I'm afraid I can't let you in.
I'm having a bit of a situation.
I need some help.
- I need to borrow some money.
- Of course you do. Everyone needs money.
Uh-
Didn't your grandfather
leave you anything?
What are you talking about?
He hated me.
Jason, he did not.
He didn't come around much, but, uh,
I always thought it was because of me.
It doesn't matter.
Do you have any extra spending cash?
I would love
to help you.
- But I can't.
- You can't?
They told me specifically that you would be
comin' around for money...
and that I was not
to give you anything.
But I'm your son, Mom.
That's what you're supposed to do.
If I violate
their instructions...
I am out everything-
everything.
So for the sake
of the greater good...
I must insist
that you leave.
I'm not gonna upset
the whole applecart...
just because you're facing
a few challenges.
I'm sorry. I just
cannot help you.
- Thanks.
-
-
- Ow!
Hey, man. You're-
You're on my bench.
You're on my bench.
Beat it.
- A simple ''no''would have sufficed.
- Fine. No.
- No, what?
- No, you cannot sit on this bench.
This is not your bench.
This is a city bench.
- Go sit on another bench.
- But it's my bench.
I've gotjust as much
right to it as anybody.
- It's a free country, you know.
-
See, that's where
you're wrong.
Name one thing
in this country that's for free.
You need money for everything.
Without money, you're nothing.
Look at you.
No money. No food.
No family. No friends.
Nothing.
Besides, I'm sitting
on this bench now.
This is my bench.
Okay?
I'll flip you for it.
Fine.
-
-
I have a quarter.
Thanks.
Oh.
Well, aren't you gonna
chase him for it?
Beat it, kid.
I've been watching you.
You're not a real bum.
We saw you at a funeral.
Quite the entrance.
- What were you doing at-
- My mother and I come here for lunch every day.
Except, right now,
she doesn't know where I am.
-  Emily.
-  Whatever.
Emily.
Oh. Emily.
- You must really be having a bad life.
- Come on. Right now.
I was just having a pleasant conversation
with this gentleman.
- Leave us alone, please.
- Dear, don't be ridiculous.
Sorry to disturb you. Come on.
That's okay. I'm not the one
who's disturbed.
Some friend you are.
Thanks a lot, poser.
You know what I've said
about talking to strangers.
- He's not a real bum.
- Hey. Whoa, whoa. Wait, wait, wait.
Okay, this is gonna sound
really, really strange...
but I'm just gonna
come out and say it.
I'll make a deal with you.
I need a friend.
But only for a little while,
and, uh...
in return, I don't know,
I'll take you both to Disney World.
- Excuse me?
-
- I need a friend.
- Explain yourself.
- It's complicated.
- No, it's not.
It's pathetic.
- Come on. Now, just because-
- Mom, I told you.
- He's not a real bum.
- Okay.
Oh, dude, come on.
She doesn't even like
Châteauneuf du Pape.
Miss Hastings,
bring me the Stevens file.
Looks like our boy's not even
gonna make it through round two.
But, sir...
doesn't he have until
the end of today?
Well, from what I hear...
he could have another month
and still get the same result.
Yes, sir.
- So, what do you think? Is this a good spot?
- Yeah, perfect.
You can see everything
under the perfect tree.
- Hey! Hey! Give that back!
- I'm sorry, ma'am. I'm just hungry.
- Sir,you need to step back.
- Don't you have a sandwich?
- You need to step back.
-  Leave her alone.
Get back. Get back.
I've got 9 11all dialed in.
All I have to do is press ''Send.''
Sweetheart, get back.
- Ow! No!
- Hey! Hey! Leave 'em alone.
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!
Whoo! Yeah.
My bench.
Mwah!
- So, you have a bet with a dead guy?
- Mm-hmm.
- Cool.
- Emily. Be polite.
Wait. How can you have a bet with a...
deceased person?
See, that's the part
that's complicated.
So you come up
with a friend.
What do you get if we
go along with this?
- Emily.
- No, it's okay. I don't know.
Something about an ultimate gift
or something.
But you're not sure
what that is.
Yeah, that about
sums it up.
So what do we get
if we agree to do this?
- We need money.
How much are you willing to pay?
- Emily.
I'm sorry. You're gonna
have to excuse my daughter.
Sometimes she tends to be
a little outspoken.
I can't promise you anything.
Now, that's better.
But what if
we really did...
become friends?
- Emily, it's not polite-
- Shh.
- So you're Jason's friend?
- Yes, I am.
- True friend?
- Absolutely.
Pinky promise.
So, how long have you
known Mr. Stevens?
We go way back.
We're like this.
Now, where do I sign?
And, uh...
he hasn't promised you
any compensation for this friendship?
Look at him.
Does he look like
he has anything to offer?
So, uh...
you expect this friendship
to continue?
I plan on knowing  Jason
for the rest of my life.
Tomorrow- lunch at noon,
our usual spot in the park.
Sure.
Just a minute, pal.
You owe me.
Emily. Wait.
They go back a long way, don't they?
There was a time when Mr. Hamilton
was quite ill...
and needed
a kidney transplant.
Your grandfather went out of his way
to help him find a donor.
You could even say, I think,
that Mr. Hamilton's alive today...
because of Red Stevens.
Um.
In the, um, basement
of this building...
there's a small apartment
for a custodian.
It isn't being used right now.
Perhaps you'd, um, like
to take a look at it?
Thank you.
Jason, you have no concept whatsoever
of the value of money.
Money has always been available to you,
like the air you breathe.
I tell you, let's, uh, review some highlights
of your recent past.
A $25,000-per-night suite
in Paris...
with a personal chef
whom you tipped heavily.
Toured the Bordeaux region
in chauffeured hot-air balloons.
That was amazing.
A week of heli-skiing
in Saint Moritz.
A small fleet
of exotic cars.
The latest in everything,
including women.
But the past is the past...
and I figure you've probably had
a pretty tough month.
Well, it's about time.
Thank you very much.
And if I ever
see you two again...
it'll be too soon.
Well, seeing how you've never
held one of those before...
let me explain what it is.
That's a paycheck.
That's for what you earned at Gus's ranch.
Of course, the I..S. ravaged it first.
I hate those guys.
In your pocket
every step of the way.
You start out in business,
and then you have to make a payroll.
Andjust when you think
you're gonna make a-
Mr. Stevens, this is
the ''Gift of Money, ''please.
Yeah, all right. Sorry.
Look at me.
I'm carrying on about death and taxes
even after I'm dead.
Now,you have to take that money and-
as much as you need it yourself-
spend it on someone
experiencing a real problem.
What can they teach you?
Put yourself
in their shoes.
Jason, would you like us
to cash it for you?
Please.
I think we know you
well enough...
that we won't need
any I.D.
How will you know
how I spent it?
We'll know.
Hey.
I didn't
take anything.
Nothin'. Nothin'.
Oh, no.
Great.
Naturally.
Ayoung blonde woman
and her little girl.
-Just down the hall.
- Thanks.
Paging Dr. Howard. Dr. Howard.
Paging Dr. Kline.
Dr. Kline.
Paging Dr. Howard.
What are you doing here?
- You saw her.
- Yeah.
Did you talk to her?
- So, what's wrong with her?
- That depends.
- On what?
- On who you really are.
Maybe I can help you.
Emily has leukemia.
We thought she was in remission after
her bone marrow transplant...
but a couple of weeks ago-
her body started
to reject the transplant.
I'm sorry.
Uh, hey.
Uh, well, you gotta
need money, right?
Oh, so that's it. You won your bet
with your rich grandfather.
You're back off the streets.
Congratulations. What is it now?
Uh, I do have
to give away some money.
You're getting less mysterious
by the minute.
I bet you're gonna get to the end
of your game, collect your cash...
- and just ride off into the sunset.
- I don't know. Maybe.
But, Alexia, if I can help you,
why won't you just let me?
Because no... rich kid
is gonna use me or my daughter...
to play a game.
She owes $1,600
in back rent. Pay it.
You're a hundred dollars short.
Your check was for 1,500.
Tell Hamilton I'm good for it.
Just pay that bill.
- Your other hundred.
-
Well, push ''Play.''
Our lives should be lived
not avoiding problems...
but welcoming them as challenges
that will strengthen us...
so that we can be
victorious in the future.
So, now that I've given you the gift of work
and friends and the value of money...
let's discover
the gift of family.
Now this is a tough one...
but see if it's even
remotely possible...
to get something positive
out of our family.
See if they truly know
how to count their blessings.
If my doctors
are remotely accurate...
this assignment might even
fall on Thanksgiving.
How appropriate.
He's joking, right?
Dr. Allen,you're wanted in O.B.
Dr. Allen, please report
to Obstetrics.
- Hey, where's the girl?
- Who, Emily?
She's with God.
Oh, there's my best friend.
Listen, about the other day-
So, now you know
all about me.
No more mysteries.
- Look, I'm really sorry.
- Shut up.
Don't be pathetic.
I wonder if he takes
advance orders.
For what?
For my place.
You know, up there.
What do you think
it's gonna be like?
Butterflies.
Lots of butterflies.
Did you know, God...
paints every color on a butterfly
with his fingers.
I didn't know you thought about
stuff like that.
I think about dying.
There's something basically unfair
about a person dying.
I even hate the idea.
You know, I, uh-
I don't know much
about God or-
or Jesus.
But I can promise you that those arms
are meant for you.
What's gonna happen
to my mom?
I really don't hate her,
you know.
Did I mention...
I wouldn't be upset
if you kissed her?
Do you think
your mom and I-
Okay. It's official.
- You are the slowest person I have ever met.
-
You two were made
for each other.
I knew that
back in the park.
- In the park, I looked like a bum.
- Let's not be delusional.
You were a bum.
So, what are you doing
for Thanksgiving?
- Mrs. Drummond?
- Yes.
I want to send Emily's charts and blood work
off to a specialist-
see whether or not she's a candidate
for another transplant.
Oh. Uh, will that give her
a better chance than chemo?
Unfortunately, chemotherapy
isn't going to be enough.
I'm sorry.
Thank you.
So when I found out
I was pregnant...
he was getting ready
to leave for college and, uh...
didn't want anything
to get in his way.
And Emily- she's-
she's the best decision
I ever made.
So, apparently...
someone came by
and covered my back rent.
Was it you?
Thank you.
I have a question for you,
and I hope I'm not being out of line here.
I was wondering if you'd like
to join me for Thanksgiving.
Oh. Um, thanks.
That's nice of you to ask,
but I can't.
Um, obviously, Emily needs me here, so-
But thanks.
Well, it's too bad,
because you're missing out...
on a splendid example
of a way-too-wealthy American...
dysfunctional thing.
- It's-Yeah.
- Oh.
You know, I have the strangest feeling
I might have enjoRed it.
What are you
thinking about?
Nothin'.
You're thinking
about Jason.
Yeah. He's weird, isn't he?
He's a good weird.
You know, he, uh, invited me...
over to Thanksgiving
with his family.
- Oh, really?
- Yeah. Of course, I told him, ''Whatever, loser.''
- I think you should go.
- Absolutely not.
I wouldn't dream of missing
Thanksgiving with you.
So why'd you decide to come?
- My daughter banished me.
-  Oh.
So I have you by decree.
Mmm, knowing Emily-
by design.
Mission accomplished.
Two completely
opposite people...
who wouldn't have had
a chance without me...
destined to make
each other miserable.
You okay, Jason?
Oh. Don't tell me
you've never been on a bus before.
Wow.
-
- Brace yourself.
Jason, seriously.
- I'm willing to bet that they are
perfectly normal people.
- Oh, yeah? How much?
Thank you.
You know, I had my firm
do an informal audit-
just the financials
of the publicly held side.
And there's still
several hundred million floatin' around.
Well,you knew him better than I.
Most of those companies
were privately held.
Maybe we should check into
some ofhis favorite charities.
- They do have to report large contributions.
- That's a great idea.
Daddy always was a sucker
for a begging hand.
Hmm. Unfortunately,
you're right.
And what sort ofbusiness
does your family come from, Alexia?
Um, health care.
Oh, how wonderful.
Well, we have a wing
in the hospital downtown.
A couple of wings, I think.
Or is it
a couple of hospitals?
I always forget.
My daughter is receiving great care
thanks to your father.
Great sector-health care.
Little flat in the third quarter,
but poised to rocket.
-
- Okay. I'd like to propose a toast.
-
- Yes. To each other.
For suffering through a year
of great adjustment.
Uh, excuse me.
Does anyone else seem to notice
it smells a little like-
cowhide in here?
And how are those
sin stocks of yours doing, Jack?
What's wrong with a little
investment in alcohol, tobacco and firearms?
- Over the stench of oil?
-  And what's wrong with oil,
thank you very much?
My money's just as
green in Manhattan as anywhere else.
So, who does get
the rest of the estate?
Sarah?
Well, I don't know
anything about that.
Well, you were
the last one in there.
- No, I wasn't.
- Well, that's just ridiculous, darling.
When we left, you were
the only one there.
Well, Jason was also there.
- Ah. Jason.
-  Do enlighten us, Jason.
You certainly could not
have been the one...
that received the bulk
of Red's estate.
-  Or are you?
- Is that why you insisted we
get together for Thanksgiving-
so you could reveal
your newly enhanced trust fund to us?
It's Thanksgiving. I was hoping
maybe we could all go around the table...
and each say something
that we're most thankful for.
- Are you on crack, Jason?
- Again?
Well, here's a thanks.
We don't have to put up with Dad's endless
litany of clichéd quotes this season.
Or hand-spun,
cornpone wisdom.
Who is that?
I think he works
down at the video store.
Well, Jason will tell you
all you need to know about this man...
this... dearly departed.
I mean, he more
than anyone here...
has a bone to pick
with the late, great Red Stevens.
Jason, I can only imagine
what you'vejust been through.
- I could never get them to be
thankful for anything either.
-  What have you got?
- Hey.
-  What in the world is that?
- All right, give it back.
-  Pass it to me. Come on.
- Give it back!
-  ...and if you do succeed...
- Here. Take it!
-you'll be one step closer to all I have for you.
What's ''all I have for you''?
It's between him and me.
It's none of your business.
It has everything to do with us.
It's our money!
So he's making you work
for your inheritance?
Not anymore, 'cause I don't
think I could ever win at this one.
Alexia, let's go.
- Jason. Wait. Wait!
- Don't!
Just tell them
what they want to hear.
I don't have
to tell them anything.
Jason, you're gonna hear
from my attorney Monday morning.
- Yeah. Ditto.
- Shut up, jack.
You're all pathetic.
Wait.
Jason, slow down.
I put up with that for years.
I was a part of that.
What happened
to your dad?
He's dead. What else
do you want to know?
How'd he die?
The only person who really knows
just took it to his grave.
Jason, there's something
I always want you to remember, okay?
When I met you,
you were a homeless person.
And you made friends
with my daughter.
We shared
peanut butter-and-jelly sandwiches.
All this without me knowing
anything about your background.
Yeah, well, the problem is,
that's me back there.
Yeah, but you can walk away from all that.
You already have.
I appreciate what you're saying,
but money changes things.
It gets you stuff. It's a- It's a way
to live life worry free.
- Money takes away the worry.
- Yeah, I saw what money can do.
And your worries-
or whatever
you want to call them-
they're not
life or death, Jason.
Okay, I'm sorry, but my getting
my inheritance is a matter of life or death.
And I know when I say that,
I sound like I'm being a Stevens...
and being a Stevens
is all about money.
But it's not.
It's more.
So, I'll pay you back
as soon as possible.
What?
Uh, the money I owe you-
the 1,600.
Happy Thanksgiving.
