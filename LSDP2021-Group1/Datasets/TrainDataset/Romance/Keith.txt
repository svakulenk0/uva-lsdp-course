Because Walt specifically promised
me an agreeable lab partner.
- Walt?
- You need to relax.

Then you'll be ahead of the game, right?
Then I can focus on that things
where good I and keep up my GPA.
Okay, so we need to fill this one with

Gotta keep up that GPA.

Except you're about ten years into the future...
We don't need chemistry.
We need time travel.

Keith is actually pretty sharp
when he press myself.
Okay.
- But a bit kind of...

Should cry for me because

It's posted in the front office.
- Why are they do that?
- Why Duke?

- Actually I have a partial scholarship.
- Ah, that's right.

So they basically give you a punch of money
for banding a ball over a net.
Something like that.
Where did you apply?

Keith.
Keith!
- The lab report is due tomorrow.
- Ah, yes.
But the real pressing question is,
how is Rafael Marques, your boyfriend.
He is not...
Great choice that Rafael!
Brainy stud! Perfect guy! Can't go wrong!
- You were at the brink.
- No.
But you were.
- If you weren't then how would you know?
- Because that's where everyone goes.
- What about the lab report?
- Hop in!
- Come on! I do my best work while I'm driving.
- I have your book.
By heating tin metal...
in air... at a high temperature...
we were produce a tin-oxygen product
called...
Wait!
So we need to convert two masses to moles
and dividing the greater mole quantile by the lesser.
Okay, so... 0,01731 tin,
and 0,0350 oxygen.
- So the mole ratio is?
- Mole ratio? What's that?
- It's the thing you have to figure out.
- But you are already knowing the answer.
Oh, come on, you're being a jerk!
I need to be back in office in fifteen minutes.
What's the rush? We're here in a yellow truck,
a road ahead of us and nothing but opportunities.
- Okay, what opportunities...?
- Choose a place!
- Pick a place! Right now! At random!
- Okay, I choose...
...the third point on our lab report
calculating the mole ratio.
I can't concentrate driving in a straight
line like this, this is not gonna work.
- Then turn!
- Where?
Anywhere.
Wow! Very funny.
The mole ratio therefore is two to one.
But now we need to find potential
oxidation numbers of tin and oxygen.
Which are?
It's time for our picnic scene.
Keith!
There he is! How's it going?
Move along, dear!
In case you haven't heard picnics
they usually take place outdoors.
Oh, is that what it says
in the official picnic rule book?
This's not funny.
Do you think our check is ready yet?
I know, my pumpkin love, I'm pissed off too.
Can you believe this shit?
It's been three months since that accident.
The nerve...
- Take me back to school now!
- Yeah! Let's go back to the library
and finish lab report in a safe,
acceptable way like everybody else.
Bone grafts are really starting to kick in now.
Hey, Ralph!
No, thanks.
- You said two one right for the mole ratio?
- Yeah.
Duke.
- You'll give a job like this one day?
- God, no.
- My dad used to work in a place like this.
- Ah, yes. Daddy Anderson.
An accountant? A salesman?
A Norwegian fisherman!
District manager for a phonecall company.
You're not very good at reading minds.
Well, that's 'cause I wasn't really trying.
He manages stacks of paper. Moving them from
side to side, every day, he hates his job.
When he was your age he dreamed of
going to Duke but they rejected him.
So he poured over every detail of your application,
night after night, until you finally got it right.
Natalie Anderson, the star of the household,
who loves beeing in the center of the attention.
She just wished it din't mean
having to play tennis all of the time.

- Right.

Why don't you tell him the truth?
You're spending a couple of
hours with your lab partner.
- What I do with Raff is none of your business.
- My point exactly.

and nothing but opportunities, right?
Turn right up here!
Right here! This dirt road up ahead!
Come on! What?
- Why here?
- Why?
It's not supposed to be a why, right?
Were you scared?
- Wow! Slow down!
- Just funny. Really funny.
- What?
- You chose this road.
So that's the Brink!
I've never been on this side.
- I've never been on that side.
- You're not missing much.
Really? I thought you're the Brink Queen.
It's getting on really old.
It's all about what you're wearing and who's
hooking up with who and showing off your boyfriend.
- Many essential information.
- Oh, yeah.
Down there they live and die by that crap.
But up here it's like...
...what have I ever care.
- You don't...
- What?
You don't care what people think.
You're just...
...you.
- Whatever that is.
- It's a good thing.
Really good thing.
So do you come here a lot?
Cool.
- I found your place.
- I don't know how you did.
Chances are probably one in a billion.
Stranger things have happened, right?
You know... we should probably leave.
- Yeah.
- We're lab partners.
- Yeah.
- This is strictly a lab partnership.
- Absolutely.
- And Walter would be very very upset right now. So...
- Hello, Raff.
- Hi, beautiful! Are you ready?
I'm so sorry, I've just go ahead from a shower.
Actually... I don't really feel like
to go to the brink tonight.
- Why? What's wrong with the brink?
- Just that we've gone on since last six weeks in a role.
I know but we've promised to Trisha,
- and you know to Robbie.
- We'll see them all the time.
Well, you see me all the time.
So you're sick of me all the time?
Of course I'm not kidding sick of you
I'm just really be .
Had a long day, practice after school.
I was getting to call you sooner.
Okay, it's right. Just get some sleep
and we'll hang tomorrow, okay?
- Yeah, see you next happening.
- Okay.
- Okay, bye!
- Bye!
- Hi!
- Hi!
Natalie!

- Notre Dame!
That's great!
We have to celebrate this!
- Okay, partner, now I've got a scene.
- Shoot!
It's the scene where you tell me the truth.
The big confession scene.
What are you doing after finish highschool?
Really.
- I'm going to London.
- London?
Me too! With Raff and Brooke and Travis!
We should meet up!
Not that London.
London Ontario. It's a classic
truckshow there every year in July.
- So you really are truck geek.
- You see I open up to you and you dump on me.
No, just because I know you have dreams
more than a truck show.
- The sky's the limit, right?
- Yeah, actually it is.
You, sure?
I'm sure you sell yourself short.
Are we... are we moving?
- We are moving!
- A step for moving into the space on a mission...
Keith, we have a problem.
- I think, there is an untreatable one in the space craft...
- Keith! Get up! Come on!
- Keith, it's gonna go over! Get up!
- He's taken on the body by trusted co-pilot
- called Natalie Anderson...
- Keith! It's gonna go over!
- "It's gonna go over!"
- Come on! What are you doing?
- Keith! Stop it!
- She's just saying: "Keith, stop it!"
Keith, come on!
- Shit! Keith! Hurry up!
- "Get up, Keith. Get up."
Keith, come on, get up or
you're gonna get killed! Keith!
Stop it! Stop the truck! Keith!
What the hell was that?
Are you crazy?!
If you do shit like that,
you could get yourself killed!
Don't mention what would've
happened to my truck...
Oh... oh yeah!
It's true you wanna go over?
- I wasn't even close.
- Yes, you were.
- You don't know how close is.
- Don't give me one of your stupid lines!
I know what close is.
Goodnight, partner.
Take care of yourself, okay?
MORPHINE, INDICATED FOR THE TREATMENT OF DEPRESSION
No, not C, Z. Zetterstrom.
Z, E, T, T, E... Are you sure?
- What do you think you do on?
- What?
- Using yourself phone on the school property?
- Hey... don't!
It was Duke, apparently there's
a problem with my trans courts.
- Oh, so everything is okay?
- Actually I have to go in the front office to deal with this.
Sucks.
- Bye!
- Bye!
Look, he's not gone for few days now so I was thinking
I should call him you know get him kinda homework at all.
I'm sorry, we don't get out any information.
But it's kind of emergence.
You know Keith is falling behind me,
it's in fact bad for me to perform the APs.
You have to speak to Mr. Miles regarding that.
Okay, look, he's my friend. He's gave me his number,
I'd just losted it. It's really not a big deal.
- I'm sorry, I can't.
- Where is he? Why isn't he come?
I'm trying to learn, but he doesn't care!
I think Keith's having a thought time at the moment.
- Thought how?
- Thanks.
- That's all I can say really.
- But... is there anything I can do?
- I knew this was a bad idea.
- What?
- What?
- Partner on your guys.
But it was random.
He chosed me?
- Keith chosed me?
- I'll make sure he gets your notes.
Randy Randerson's managed to set into final match.
- Wanna I come in?
- Maybe. No.
Shit, I don't know. I think, I just
to get some sleep, or something.
Are you puzzle with Keith?
- Where that come from?
- Do you?
As the matter in fact I have
absolutely zero plans with Keith.
- But you were hanging with him.
- I hang with a lot of people.
Is there any wrong with that?
I'm only had to be seen with you?
No, no. Relax, okay?
The match is over.
Sorry. It's just a screwed day.
So everything is okay?
He's just my lab partner and my friend.
Actually he's not even my friend
- so can we just let it go?
- Yeah, whatever.
So we'll talk to later.
Natalie, we have to talk!
I've lost a match.
Get over, Mom!
Natalie, come back!
Natalie, I'm talking to you!
- Yeah?
- Hi! Is Keith home?
- Keith?
- I'm his lab partner.
- May I help you?
- Are you Mr. Zetterstrom?
- Mr. who?
- This is the Zetterstrom house?
My name is Don. Don Sope.
Sorry. Wrong house.
Oh, quiz! Sweet! What timing.
Morning, Walt! Thank you.
Hey, partner, thanks for those notes,
I killed that quiz.
- Where have you been the last two weeks?
- Last two weeks?
- What, do you come here every day?
- There's some wrong with you, isn't there?
Yeah, yeah there is, with me,
definitely with you,
- with this sexy little freshman right here.
- I don't wanna be funny anymore, Keith.
Oh, well I hate to break it to you, Anderson
but you've never really been funny to begin, right?
What are you? Depressed or something?
Depressed? Yes, throw that out there.
Chicks find it incredibly sexy.
- I'm being serious, Keith.
- Why?
It never works.
You could have to told me.
Could I told you what?
- That you have problems?
- You don't know the half of them.
- Hey, Raff.
- What's going on?
What?
- The jacket...
- Oh, are you like it? I got it from K-Mart.
Raff, I was cold he lent it to me.
Oh, come on, you don't expect
him to believe that, do you?
See Raff we're part of this jacket smuggling ring,
but if you're quiet enough I swear
there's a fleece in it somewhere for you.
- Look, I'm not talking to you, okay?
- Hey, man, don't get mad at me.
- I only a supply dishing, okay? I don't create the demand...
- Shut the hell up!
Raff! Raff, it's just a jacket.

- I don't know. I don't know anything anymore.
Why did you choose me your lab partner?
- Me?
- Don't bullshit me! Miles told me!
Walter Miles is CIA, you can't trust him.
- Where do you live?
- What?
Where do you live?
You've lied about it!
- Are you losing it partner?
- You lied about everything!
'Cause you know what, I've got some great pills that
you can take. But I'm sure you already knew that.
I just don't understand,
Natalie was one of the school's finest students.
- I needed the chemistry notes.
- You know very well that's not the way to get them.
- She made a mistake.
- She's been under a lot of pressure lately with
the tennis, the schedule and the homework...
I'm sorry but the faithing's school
properties are remarked one week suspension.
- What? What was just to suppose to do...?
- Natalie.
- I can make any exceptions to therefore.
- I needed the notes I have to take my AP!
Mr. Miles make sure you get thoes notes.
Just don't make a mass of those things
what there you worked so hard!
Please, can we leave just not?
- You don't wanna something to tell us?
- Stop the car!

- You didn't want me to.
There are billion other schools
and than or I could get a job
- Or something.
- You don't have to a comromise, honey
if we focus on this week the scholarship'll be back.
Maybe I don't wanna give it back.
Maybe I don't wanna play tennis
for six hours a day at the college.
Maybe I'm sick of it after 10 stupid years!
Thouht I ever cared of you?
Honey, there's no reason to give up on your dream now.

Alright ladies, gentleman.
Please leave your final reports on my desk...
and I want to make sure your glassworhts are cleaned,
your beakers and your testcubes aren't dirty.
If these aren't clean, you must clean them
or you'll lose points.
If anything is missing, please gonna sign me immediately.
Finally you make sure that your labdesks are cleaned...
Four test cubes, three beakers...
and a Bunsen burner.
Yeah, okay, everything seems to be in order. Keys?
Natalie, key?
The end of Chemistry as we know it.
You're such a goddamn glib little actor!
As far as I'm concerned this is
a really chickenshit goodbye!
Excuse me.
Don't worry, Walter.
She was adressing her remarks to me.
Hey! That truck-guy's here.
Said something about going out bowling.
- Okay.
- I've got.
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Everybody bites it sooner or later.
I'm just in the AP class, ahead of the game.
- Always the joke.
- Al says it's a phase, it'll stop soon.
But, hey! At least it wasn't all
about the sympathy for the sick kid.
That's not fair!
Is Duke fair?
Is Europe fair?
At this rate I won't even make it
to London, Ontario. Is that fair?
Bowling.
That's what I get.
Bowling.
- We're not going bowling.
- Why?
We're saving that.
Turn left!
- So where are we going on?
- The sky's the limit.
I've never lied in thus far.
I'm not gonna start now.
What are we doing? Really?
- This is the goodbye-scene.
- Let's not... Okay?
Come on, Zetterstrom!
You can do it!
Okay. Wake up Natalie!
Don't you see what happened here?
You had a beautiful life,
and I had shit.
I hated your guts.
I wanted to take you down, I wanted to make you
as miserable as I am and that is exactly what I did!
Now, how's that for a goodbye?
- Pretty lame.
- Face it, Anderson! I screwed you.
I screwed you big time.
So you screwed me. So what?
Me? I made love to you.
Try again.
Try again!
I had it all figured out.
So I cut out a little early, who cares?
It's probably a good thing.
Life sucks, anyway.
But then I met you and it got weird.
And you were so amazing.
- And I...
- What?
What?
I just wanted a little more time.
So all in all, I'd say you're
the worst thing that's ever happened to me.
Goodbye partner.
I'm staying with you until you leave.
I don't care how much time we have!
Give up you stupid jerk?
I'm starting it up.
Now turn into the left till the get its place!
Then back a little bit.
Okay.
Perfect. It'll good for 50,000 miles.
