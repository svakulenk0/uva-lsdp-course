Buck it out!
It's a form,
for crying out loud!
What could be simpler? All you
have to do is fill in the blanks.
What do I have to do,
hire a nursemaid
to hold your hand,
put ribbons in your hair?
If you want him down,
this is no huge problem.
You should be able to fill
out a form correctly!
Then I'll just have to
get somebody who can.
I'm not gonna ask you again.
Get back to your desk,
Rebecca!
I was a good boy.
What's happening, boys?
I was a good boy.
Well, well.
What are you
doing here?
I smell business.
Third bureaucrat
this month.
Aah!
Hey, enough
of this shit.
Tell Carl
to shoot him.
He's fucking up
traffic.
What's his name?
Jeffrey Arthur brose
of the interstate
commerce commission,
whatever the hell
that is.
What'd you say, man?
You said the what? The
interstate commerce commission?
He didn't say that.
Yes, he did.
Here. Hold this.
Just tell them
don't shoot.
Regis, get back here.
Just hang on
a second.
Strap in. This is
gonna get weird.
I wanna talk
to this guy.
No! No! Go away!
Regis: Hey, hey, hey.
No, go away.
Any improper behavior
on the part of any employee
has to be reported.
Ok. Just be easy, man.
Look, I just wanna
talk, all right?
See? I got no gun.
Got no gun.
I will kill myself.
I believe you.
I believe you.
I just wanna
ask you a question.
Now, you work for the interstate
commerce commission, right?
No. They let me go.
They just threw me out.
You, too?
They evicted me, too.
I mean, they bought up
my whole apartment building
so they could turn it
into a parking garage for...
They're so unfair!
I agree.
"The durable goods
division."
Now, can you please tell
me what the hell that is?
What is that?
Don't work there anymore, and
they're on the second floor.
But do you know
anybody I could talk to?
Because I've been writing
and I've been phoning them.
I sent an e-mail,
and nobody calls me.
They're just
jerking me around.
I'm telling you, it's
driving me crazy, man.
No, I'm crazy!
Uhh!
They were gonna
shoot you, Jeffrey.
Christ, Regis.
What are you, insane?
The gun's on safety.
All right, boys, I'm
thinking this looks, uh...
Handled.
Come on, stingo.
Let's get out of here.
Aah! Aah! Aah!
Move! Move!
Go! Go!
Sector 6 secure.
Sector one secure.
Go.
Freeze!
Corey luchessi.
I work here.
Sector 5 secure.
There's a gun on you.
Get up slowly.
Sorry, sir.
Sector 2 secure.
Sector 3 secure.
All sectors secure.
America held hostage,
day 182,
a special report.
CNN has just received
this smuggled video footage
showing American
awacs soldiers in captivity
and under extreme duress.
You see this?
Government officials
expressed outrage
upon viewing these tapes.
Pentagon sources
say the U.S. seventh fleet
remains on full alert in the
sea of Japan at this hour.
Air force officials have
reiterated their initial statement
describing
the awacs crew's mission
as a routine flight...
Can you believe this?
I mean, what is
this president waiting for?
...aircraft carrier
in the Gulf.
North Korea maintains
the awacs crew...
Is leaseholder
one word or two?
It's one.
Damn.
In the face of growing
capitol hill support
for military intervention,
the president
called for Patience
and stated
that the negotiations...
Oh, I see. So you
negotiate for 13.
How many do you
go to war for? 14?
That it? I mean,
everything's about numbers.
You're an alcoholic.
That's your third.
Hit me again, man.
Yeah?
Regis.
Mm-hmm.
It's farr.
Ok.
I'm not here.
I'm not here.
Captain.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I got a coat and a tie.
Yeah, Harlan Regis,
homicide.
Detective Regis, come
right on through, please.
I'll take
your weapon.
You'll get it back
when you leave.
This way, please.
Gentlemen.
Straight ahead.
Dang.
And straight down
this hallway to the left.
Puncture wounds
upper torso and base neck
would be 5 to 8
centimeters across.
Lividity and rigor
are progressing...
What's up?
Jimmy.
Get in here
and take a look at this.
She's a baby.
Man, what is
the world coming to?
What time she found?
About 11:00.
Name?
Carla town.
Our best guess
is she's dead
maybe 3 hours.
Where's the first family?
Camp David.
Left yesterday
afternoon.
So do you got an idea
what the murder weapon is?
Well, it's not as clean
as a knife, reg.
You see that jagged edge
on the wound there?
It's not big enough
to be scissors,
so I figure it must be
something smaller.
Excuse me. All film
stays in house.
Orders.
Whose orders,
tepper?
Anyone know what she
was doing here so late?
You're not cleared.
Who invited you here
anyway?
We did.
Sir,
he's not cleared.
He's
a D.C. homicide cop.
Well, if I'm not mistaken,
Mr. spikings,
what I see over there
is a homicide.
Spikings:
But jurisdiction...
jurisdiction
can go to hell.
With all due respect,
I'm in charge
of white house security.
With all due respect, I'm the
president's national security adviser.
A woman murdered
in the white house
the president sleeps
is a matter
of national security.
Alvin Jordan.
Yes. Harlan Regis,
homicide.
Sir, do you happen
to know what she was doing
working here so late
on a Friday night?
Well, the government doesn't shut
down just because it's Friday.
Ah, yes. I understand.
Oh, and do you know how many
people were in the white house?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Carry on, detective.
Thank you, sir.
We'd like you to avoid
using 2 words
if you give any statements
to the media.
The words
are woman and murder.
You say all information
will be forthcoming
on an appropriate
and timely basis.
Mr. spikings...
One more thing.
I'm gonna need
everything you have
on what she was
working on...
you'll get
what's material.
Well, this is D.C., and,
unfortunately, she's mine.
She was murdered
in the white house,
not in some alley
out in southeast.
She was killed
in my city.
She was killed
in my house.
Don't you ever forget that.
He's all yours.
Hey, I'm just trying
to do my job.
Oh,
I guess I'm supposed
to get my briefings
from CNN, right?
No, you get it from
your secret service liaison
for the task force.
Well, he didn't
assign me one.
Yes, he did.
Nina chance.
I see. They think
I'm boo boo the fool.
Excuse me?
So I guess he figures that
I'll be easier on you
than I would some rookie
with acne, right?
Detective,
I'm an on-line agent
for the United States
secret service,
which means,
among other things,
that I'm fully qualified
to answer any questions
relating to white house
security.
Furthermore, I resent
the implication...
furthermore, you resent
the implication?
Man.
People don't even speak
English in this town anymore.
Detective,
it's this way.
I know that.
There's been
no statement yet
about what's happening
in the white house.
We've been told only
that the first family
is at camp David
for the weekend.
As you can see behind me,
the immediate area
has been sealed off.
Sheldon turcott,
CNN, at the white house.
Why kill someone from
the office of protocol?
Maybe she sat some ambassador
in the wrong seat.
Oh, they kill you
for that now?
Tough town.
If I would have known,
I would have put
a turnstile in here
and charged admission
or something.
Who else was here?
Um, secret service.
They started
around 11:15.
And can you believe they
even took her garbage?
Anyway,
if you guys want me,
I'll be downstairs,
Thank you
very much.
Anytime.
Wait a minute.
The body's found at 11:00,
and the feds arrive here
How do they do that?
Yeah. They don't even have
cool sirens like we do.
Look at her photo album.
Look at this, Regis.
Is this the only one?
It's the only one
I see,
but, you know,
I just got here.
I can tell you that the
apartment is registered
in the name of,
uh...
Brookland
associates,
but that is about all
I have right now.
Psst.
Wow. 1.2 on the beach.
White house giving out
some pretty sweet Christmas
bonuses this year.
Yeah,
looks that way.
I want a complete list of
everybody in-house last night
between 9:00 and 11:00,
and don't tell me
that is classified.
Quick on the draw,
huh, agent chance?
There's only 30 names here.
All whereabouts
accounted for.
Spikings told me
that there were 31.
I mean,
I see his name here.
So whose name
is missing?
Well, apparently, agent
spikings was mistaken.
The count is 30
in-house.
Better check it out.
I'm on it.
So, agent chance,
where you from?
Iowa.
Iowa, huh?
So why
the secret service?
I mean, why not...
Why not
kindergarten teacher?
No, you don't look like
one of those at all.
I was in the Olympics.
The Olympics?
That's how I got
in the secret service.
Is that right?
I was on
the sharpshooting team.
I met president Reagan.
It was in 1988.
One of his agents
was a woman.
She sort of took me
under her wing.
Mmm. Sharpshooting. Ha.
I feel safe already.
I brought home the gold.
Wow.
Chance: Where are we going?
Regis: To my place.
I gotta change.
You're being evicted?
The whole damn building.
The feds
are tearing it down
to put up a parking
garage for the, uh...
For the, uh...
Interstate commerce
commission.
Yeah.
What do they need a parking
lot around here for?
Hell if I know. I've been
trying to figure that out.
Whole building thinks that I
can fix it because I'm a cop.
Harlan, what's going on?
Mrs. Wallace.
Look, in less than a month,
we're going to be living
out on garbage cans.
I'm making progress,
Mrs. Wallace.
Truly I am.
Progress?
Is that what you call it?
Progress.
I should say you are
making some progress.
You better take care of your business, boy.
You know that?
That's what you
should be doing
is taking care of your business.
Making progress.
I know what he's
making progress at.
All right, make
yourself comfortable.
Washington city,
July 21, 1861.
And this is manassas,
first battle of bull run.
Come here. I want
to show you something.
Right here, that's where stonewall
Jackson got his nickname.
That's sutley Springs there.
Civilians used to come
on that crest over there
and take carriages and
picnics to watch the battle.
Amazing, huh?
How did you...
I'm a homicide cop in the
homicide capital of the world.
It's cheaper
than a shrink.
You did this
all by yourself?
Mm-hmm.
Yep.
The whole thing.
My father was
a history buff,
so I guess it kind
of rubbed off on me.
And what did he do?
He worked at the Smithsonian
for about 34 years
as a guard.
How am I gonna
move all of this?
I mean, first, I gotta
take it all apart,
and then I gotta put it
all back together again.
Oh, no. Hell, no.
I can't move.
I'll be right back.
Detective Regis, stengel's
been looking all over for you.
Who isn't?
Regis,
remember that claim check?
I sent greeley
to the drug store.
Hey.
Hi.
All right, let's
see what we got.
And there she is,
live and in color.
Where'd you get these?
We're gonna be late for the autopsy.
We gotta go.
Her visa card activity,
last 24 hours.
Banning travel,
I got it by a nose hair.
Her phone records,
her credit card,
her bank account all impounded
and now classified.
She had a shuttle flight
to New York,
a reservation at the Pierre,
a hertz rental car,
connecting flight to the
Virgin Islands, St. Croix,
one way.
Lady was buying herself
a new life.
She wasn't coming back,
uh-uh.
All right.
The evidence indicates
a crime of passion.
There's clear evidence
of vaginal penetration.
There's traces of lubricant
in the vaginal tract
and under the fingernails.
The blows were from the left
and powerful.
A condom was used.
No semen...
No blood except hers...
No DNA.
Signs of force?
No.
So you're saying sex,
not rape?
This doesn't
leave the room.
It was here we saw the image
of an untroubled
president Jack Neil
before
the white house murder
cast a dark cloud over this once
highly regarded administration.
Corey Alan luchessi,
janitor.
Nobody can account for him
during a 45-minute period
prior to the point
where
the secret service
found him working in the
east room at 11:02.
The time of
her death has been set
between 10:30
and 11:00.
That guy eats
a jelly doughnut,
and then he
stabs her 8 times.
Lee Harvey oswald
was seen
in the book depository
cafeteria drinking a coke
a minute
after Kennedy was shot.
He's reading
soap opera digest.
No, that's not enough.
If that's all you got,
you got nothing.
Except this.
It was found
in the bathroom.
It's the missing button from a shirt
found in luchessi's apartment.
Luchessi doesn't
clean the bathrooms.
All right,
where is he?
They're picking him up.
What would it take
for me
to see all the surveillance
tapes from that night?
Not much.
Just an act of congress.
After you, detective.
Hal, that button
was labeled
as being found
in the dining room.
How did it get
up in the lavatory?
Uh, I just must
have labeled it wrong.
Luchessi...
Luchessi...
Did you kill her?
Did you ever have an
affair with Carla town?
No.
No. Never.
But you did come on
to her though, right?
You did come on
to her, yeah?
Did you come on
to Carla town?
Yeah.
I came on to her.
I mean, you ever
get a look at her?
Oh, yeah.
Hot.
You ever take it
any further than that?
No.
I mean,
listen to me.
Carla...
Was strictly
hands-off.
What do you mean,
hands-off?
I don't know.
But that...
that was the word.
The secret service was
looking out for her.
How?
I don't know. Uh...
L-like if she worked
late, see. Um...
Well, the secret
service guys,
they would always
drive her home.
Don't want that,
don't want that...
That.
This is an act of war.
This is the pueblo
revisited,
and he wants to
negotiate?
Give me a break.
Neil negotiating to
defend us at a table?
Why, he can't even
defend his own house.
Fred, Fred, look.
Let me remind you
that China
and north Korea
had a defense pact
for 35 years.
You don't want
to go in there
with thousands, maybe 10s of
thousands of American lives...
Where is your rider at?
TV: He's
absolutely right.
He's got a sense of
history about this.
In '94, a U.S.
helicopter pilot
crossed over to north
Korean territory...
How did you get down here?
Ok...
If you want to live,
open the door 2 inches
and slide your weapon
out nice and easy.
Don't make me have to
stain my linen.
Out!
Shit!
It's a nasty-ass
city, Regis.
Congratulations.
You are now
a statistic.
Let me see that.
Son of a bitch.
So they're eavesdropping,
for Christ's sake.
Big surprise.
It's the government.
Look,
They
brought you in on this
for the same reason they
brought the doctors in Dallas
to work on Kennedy 2 hours
after he was killed.
They have to be seen to
be going the extra mile
so that nobody
could say
they could've
done more.
Well, you never would
have let me hold luchessi
on what they have.
You know that.
All right.
Go back and take
another look at it,
but don't make
any fucking noise
till you have
something real.
Yes, sir.
Come on, Carla...
Talk to me.
Talk to me.
Talk to me...
This is full frame?
Drug store machines
automatically crop.
Can you get me
closer to this?
No problem.
He's secret service.
Can you make me
a hard copy?
Thank you.
You're the man.
Yes, could I have a, uh,
fruit juice, please?
Hey.
Hey,
aren't you, um...
The speaker
of the house.
Yeah. How you doing?
How you doing?
Good, thanks.
Hey, listen, do you
ever speak to anybody
at the interstate
commerce commission?
I... i assume that
organization or something...
I'm not really sure...
but they're evicting me.
In fact,
they're evicting...
excuse me. Mr. speaker?
The detective's services
are needed elsewhere.
Don't worry about it.
I'll... I'll call you.
Right.
Yeah.
What are you
doing here?
I'm trying
to find you.
Look, the task force
is closed.
We have a suspect.
Yeah. Me, too.
Who's that?
He's secret service. You should know.
Who is he?
I can't tell you.
What, is that
classified, too?
Yes, it is.
Ok. I'll just have to
find out for myself.
There he is right there.
The one who just stepped to the podium.
That's him.
What's his name?
I can't
tell you that.
Well, look,
either you help me,
or I'll have to
find out the loud way.
All right.
Please.
What's his name?
Burton cash.
Who's he
assigned to?
Kyle Neil.
The president's son?
Ladies and gentlemen...
It brings me great honor
to present the first lady
of the United States,
Mrs. kitty Neil.
If the bodyguard
was there,
that means that Kyle
was on that boat as well.
Kitty:
...Domestic violence
has shattered 3 more homes
in America.
Kyle Neil was having an
affair with Carla town.
He's the one who had sex
with her that night.
You should transfer
up here right now.
Kitty: Silence is the lie
that says all is well.
I've got to go.
Hey, hey, hey,
how long do you
think it'll be
before the media
finds out
that the president's son was banging
her an hour before she died?
I've got to go.
Nice dress.
Kitty: ...With industry,
and concerned citizens
and say it's enough?
You are to have no further
contact with detective Regis.
Is that understood?
What if he initiates
contact, sir?
Then I want a report,
detailed and immediate.
Written?
Beginning with what
you two just discussed.
Right now.
Kyle?
Excuse me.
Kyle?
Kyle?
Uh...
We used to date.
Then you know
how it works.
I think you should
get some revenge.
Excuse me?
You should get
revenge.
And how do I go about
getting that?
Move to New York,
become a big model,
don't take his phone
calls anymore...
Interesting.
I need a drink.
Would you like one?
Your treat?
Uh-huh.
Sure.
What would you like?
Whatever the lady's
buying.
Bourbon?
Nice.
After 2 bourbons, she's telling
me his underwear preference
and that his one
mission in life
is to get laid in every
room in the white house.
That sounds
like a plan to me.
She even
told me this...
she said once Kyle
even bragged
about sharing a mistress
with his father.
Carla town?
Well, she
wasn't sure who.
Well, it gets
better than that, man.
Her uncle's company,
brookland associates...
leading east coast
fund-raiser for Jack Neil.
Really?
I mean, the company
that leased the president's
campaign space
owned her apartment.
Well, this is good.
This is very good.
I hope you know
what you're doing.
Good night, now.
Night, dear.
What, do you want
to see my badge?
Why did you come here?
So I'm digging...
I'm going through
the people magazine
and just happened
to come across page 16.
I find a picture of Kyle
coming back from Brazil,
and you're standing next
to him with an earpiece.
You know, I must have looked at 18
months of pictures of this guy,
and you know what I found?
I found that you
were in over half of them.
You were on his detail
and you didn't tell me.
Until when?
I have nothing more to
discuss with you about this.
The case is closed.
Agent chance, when did they
remove you from Kyle's detail?
You show up here
grilling me about work?
Just answer
the question.
Don't come
to my home again.
Answer the question!
You waltz in here
expecting me to violate
every oath I've ever taken.
I have a duty
to protect!
Your duty could send
an innocent man
to prison for the
rest of his life.
Are you comfortable
with that?
I... i think
you should leave.
How is that spikings finds
a button in the bathroom
that no other
detective found, huh?
What, did he plant it there?
I asked you to leave.
Did he plant the button?
I don't know, ok?
Everybody's
lying around here.
Ok, so again...
Why did they remove you
from Kyle's detail?
They didn't
remove me.
One night...
I heard sounds...
Of violence... fighting...
coming from
his apartment.
So I went in,
and I found him...
Beating up
his girlfriend.
And it was ugly.
And they...
We...
Covered it up for him.
That was even uglier.
And that's when I asked
to be reassigned.
Look, Nina,
I don't know what I
would do if I was you,
but I do know
one thing.
I could not let
an innocent man
fry for something
he did not do.
Maybe you can.
Get Neil out!
Bring our soldiers home!
Get Neil out!
Testing 1, 2, 3.
Testing.
The response? North Korea has
broken off negotiations...
The dark cloud that seems to be
hanging over this administration...
By an incredible
turn of events,
the FBI has not been able
to interview the first son,
now said to have been
in the white house
at the time
of the murder.
Get Neil out!
Bring our soldiers home!
I have this to add to
the Carla town effects.
Could you open it,
please?
Sure.
Thank you,
agent chance.
No problem.
Go on through.
Thanks.
Ok.
Hello?
Hello.
Any problem?
No. I finally
found everything.
You all done then?
Yeah. Yeah.
Spikings
wants to see you.
Now.
Is there anything
I should know about?
I don't know.
Is there?
You were
in the Olympics.
You know what it means
to be a team player?
Sharpshooting
isn't a team sport.
Well, this is.
We put our lives
on the line...
Every single day.
We have to trust the
people we work with.
Is there a problem?
You tell me.
This case is closed.
So I've heard.
Harlan Regis hasn't.
You would tell us
if he tried to contact
you, wouldn't you?
Of course.
Good.
'Cause if anybody found out
he elicited your support
for his paranoid
theories,
I'd hate to think
how that would look.
What people might think...
As a team.
Why is the door shut?
Excuse me?
Why are your
hands on me?
'Cause if anyone
walked in here,
I'd hate to think
how that might look,
what people
might think.
As a team.
In this day and age,
they might get
the wrong idea.
Sir...
Agent chance examined
Carla town's effects
Get her.
And Cooper...
Do it quietly.
Yes, sir.
Nina chance... find her
and lock her down.
You two cover
the stairwell.
I'll take the front.
Hey, Nina.
Hey.
We got a visual.
I got it. I got it.
Hey...
Cover the front.
Right.
Your approval
rating's dropped 19%.
Your point?
The point is,
that it's enough
to distract anybody.
From making
a sober judgment?
I can't defend
my own house,
so how am I going
to defend America?
We're a superpower.
We should act like one.
And so is China.
Which, the last time I looked,
had a defense pact
with north Korea.
We can handle
China... Now.
rate they're arming,
who the hell knows?
Mr. president...
Let's bring the boys back.
We can go in
with special forces.
Alvin?
General Tully
has a point.
think we should strike
the north Koreans.
The vice president's point
just amplifies mine.
Mr. president...
Jack...
I'm not going
to war over this.
Alvin...
I want the 7th fleet to stand down.
Not turn around.
Stand down.
If that doesn't bring them back
to the table, we'll reconvene.
All right, thank you,
Mr. president.
Gentlemen?
You may be prepared
to sit around here
while they're torturing
our boys. I'm not.
We're not being passive.
We're being patient.
And prudent.
Mr. president...
I feel duty-bound
to tell you
that your lack of action here
borders on the criminal.
Then you've done
your duty, general.
Now I'll do mine.
I expect your resignation
on my desk in the morning.
You shall have it.
That's all, gentlemen.
Alvin?
What's the matter?
Here.
This is Carla's tape from
my answering machine.
Well, how'd you get it?
That's right.
I stole it.
Look...
Here's what you need.
In her appointment book,
she has
a meeting in there
scheduled for tomorrow
in New York.
Craig nisker
and associates?
He's the king of tell-all.
His agency sold 5 of the top 10
scandal memoirs of all time.
That's his motive.
I'll be damned.
Jack, Kyle,
and Carla...
The oval office
threesome.
Figure she was going
to burn the whole family.
She was going
to score big with this.
I guess Kyle
found out about it.
We can place him at
the scene of the crime,
and we know that he had a history
of violence against women.
That's it.
Oh, he's mine.
Well, you just don't
get it, do you?
These people can
make us disappear.
I've got to get
out of here.
Where are you going?
I checked into a motel.
I'll call you.
Be careful.
The court
may direct what?
Mr. Peterson?
Uh, under 21.98
of the criminal code,
the court may allocate a fine
for the children of the victim.
Please,
Mr. Peterson, please.
What is it,
the porch light's on,
but nobody's home,
is that it?
Peterson:
Or the victim's spouse.
Incorrect, Mr. Peterson.
The court may direct that the
amount of the fine when paid
be paid for the use of the
female seduced or her child
if she have any.
Now, pursuant
to this statute,
we have Desmond vs.
Presley, which states...
Where testimony
in rape prosecution
concerning clothing of
defendant was technically...
what is it, Mr. Neil?
Heavy date?
That's... that's
pretty funny.
Hey.
You look good.
What's going on?
I just need your car,
all right?
Hey!
Get the fuck off of me!
Easy! Easy!
Jesus Christ, man,
you are a son of a bitch.
I'm going to have your goddamn
badge, you know that?
Why didn't you just shoot
her if you had this, huh?
You know who I am? You know
who you're dealing with?
I don't give a shit
who you are.
You're going down.
Turn around.
Get off of me!
Get over here.
Just like a big fish.
Fell right for the bait.
Or a man who wants to know
who's trying to frame him.
You were with her
that night.
You had sex with her,
and then you offed her.
Oh, Jesus.
You think
it was an accident
she was murdered an hour
after I slept with her?
Someone knew I'd be there
with her that night.
Yeah, maybe somebody with
a motive as good as yours.
What motive?
Did your father
have sex with Carla town?
I don't know my
father's sexual resume.
You knew that she was
leaving town, though.
Yeah, I read
the newspapers.
a connecting ticket
to the Virgin Islands,
and a hertz rent-a-car.
So?
So, Carla town didn't
have a driver's license.
You think
I killed Carla?
Yeah.
You think you
could prosecute me?
Your arms don't reach
that high, detective.
Still don't understand
why you showed up.
I go to sleep
every night
thinking about a woman
with 8 stab wounds.
A woman that I slept
with an hour before.
You try that
as a sleeping pill.
Hey, you forgot
something.
TV: In what is fast rivaling the
north Korean hostage-taking
as an issue of concern
for the white house,
the murder of Carla town
remains unsolved.
As the attention of Washington
homicide detectives
turn to Kyle Neil,
and the president's approval
ratings continue to plummet,
we must ask...
Will Carla town be
Jack Neil's chappaquiddick?
At this hour, no one knows
where the trail will end.
We do know
that for an administration
already knee-deep
in troubled waters
of a potentially international
confrontation in north Korea,
a serious domestic
concern of this nature
is especially dangerous to the
president's public image.
If Jack Neil is unable to protect
the workers under his own roof...
Coffee?
Yeah.
Come on, Regis.
Sorry I'm late.
What's the matter?
What is it?
They were there.
Who was where?
The president
and the first lady.
They weren't at camp David
when Carla was murdered.
They were in
the white house!
How do you know this?
That morning, I almost
shot their golden retriever.
They never go anywhere
without that dog.
Tonight, I saw footage of them coming
back from camp David with the dog.
Their alibi
is complete bullshit.
So, that means they
took them to camp David
after the body
was discovered.
Nina: Yeah.
Regis: Spikings. He could
have smuggled them out.
How?
The tunnels underneath
the white house.
Now, hey, look, I built
this city, remember?
I just can't
believe this.
They covered it up,
and they got them out?
Why?
Because then they'd
be considered suspects
just like
everybody else.
Why should they be,
though?
That's the question.
Nina: Because he's the president
of the United States.
Regis:
What does that mean?
That he doesn't
have a motive?
He has a mistress about
to drop a tell-all.
That's
motive enough.
The wounds are
from the left.
President Neil
is right-handed.
Yeah, I noticed that.
He writes
with his right hand,
but he swings
a baseball bat
and a golf club
with his left.
Jesus.
Yeah, she's still there.
Now, do you want me
to finish this?
Man: No. They're right
where we want them.
We're right on schedule.
Thanks, Regis.
I appreciate it.
I can take care
of myself.
I want you to lay low until I
get to Jordan or spikings.
Ok. Yeah.
Ok?
Secret service.
Shit! Mmm!
Back door.
Hey!
Move! Move!
Get them!
Go!
Go! Go!
Go for the gas tank!
He's clear!
Come on!
Reporter: Harlan, what
about Nina chance, huh?
Detective, do you have
any more information...
detective, is the
white house involved?
You want the spotlight?
Become a rock star.
I'd reassign you, but
it'd make even more news.
Come in!
Call for you,
detective Regis.
I'm not taking
any calls.
It's
the white house.
How lovely for you.
Jordan: That was some stunt you
pulled last night, detective.
Last night had nothing
to do with me.
I was off-duty.
Why do I find that
difficult to believe?
I don't care
what you believe.
I want to know why the
president was in residence
the night
of the murder,
and you
didn't tell me.
The president's
not to be involved.
The president is about to
become an official suspect.
Whoa.
Suspect?
Look, it's my duty
to question...
you're not questioning
the president.
The presidency is an
institution, not a person.
That institution will
be protected at all costs.
Why do you think we got them
out of there that night?
I don't know. Maybe
cover up a crime.
No. To get the smell of blood
away from the north Koreans.
They'd eat us alive. We'd
never get our boys back.
This is global, detective.
It's a little bit
off your turf.
This is a homicide.
This is my turf.
Let me tell you
something.
I've known Jack Neil
for 3 decades.
I'm godfather
to his son.
Your suspicions
are ludicrous.
Luchessi's a stooge.
How?
Then prove it.
Nobody can pinpoint the
actual time of death,
and he can't prove his
whereabouts for an hour.
There are 27 cameras covering the
hallways of the working white house.
You're telling me none of them
captured her walking down a hallway
within 3 minutes
of her death?
Or are you trying
to tell me?
The tapes
are classified.
Out of my reach.
You republican
or democrat?
I think Washington is drowning
in a sea of its own bullshit.
Those 13 men aren't risking
their lives over bullshit, pal.
Well, this is not
about those 13 men.
It's about a dead woman
in the white house.
You know...
Harvard did a study.
Said you could measure
a man's longevity
by the first thing he turns
to in the morning paper.
Well, I'm
an obituary man.
Start with the comics.
You'll live longer.
Whoever leaked this,
I'm going to bottle
their last breath.
Sir, if she
was alive at 10:49,
she had to be
murdered while at...
this doesn't change a damn
thing about luchessi.
Nobody saw him until 11:02.
That still gave him
Regis... What are you
going to do?
Put the president
in a lineup?
Ok. You're Carla town.
You're about to sell this story
for a shitload of money.
You're going
to move to paradise.
You buy a one-way ticket,
never to return, right?
Tape: This is sears
calling for Carla town,
confirming Monday
between 8:00 and 12:00
to install the trash compactor
you bought yesterday.
Why the hell would you
have a trash compactor
installed 2 days
after you're gone?
Maybe she forgot?
She just bought it
the day before.
What?
Shit!
Monday, 4:30.
You're right.
What have you got?
Wait a minute...
And the handwriting
on the 23rd?
The slope of the writing
is different.
Here.
Look at this.
The loop on the top of this
"L" is smooth and continuous.
In the day planner,
here, there's an obvious
pause in the writing.
Mm-hmm. Which indicates
a deliberate stroke.
Here.
It's on the "b" as well.
This is a forgery.
There never
was an appointment.
She wasn't
going anywhere.
Spikings?
Entered at 12:09,
left at 12:14.
Yes?
Yes, sir.
Surveillance tapes.
Well, he had clearance.
Thank you.
Bob?
Yes, sir?
I want to talk to detective Regis, D.C.
homicide.
He's going to want to
question Nick spikings.
Get me spikings'
address in Alexandria.
Bob: Yes, sir.
Somebody's been playing
us like puppets.
What are you saying?
Carla town wasn't killed to
protect the administration.
She was murdered
to destroy it.
What do you mean?
I'm saying that somebody dumped
the dead body in the white house
so that the blood trail could
lead right to the first family.
They even manufactured
the motive.
So?
Spikings: Only the guard
knew I took the tapes.
That means you've got
someone on the inside.
Regis: It's time you and I
stopped playing games.
Sit down.
You have any idea what it takes
to stand all day in one place
watching a dumpster
in the pouring rain?
Because that dumpster just
happens to be next to a hotel
where the president is going to
be staying the following day?
And his life
is in your hands.
Loneliest job
in the world.
Get rid of the wire.
I know who's
listening anyway.
Regis.
Think you got it all
figured out, huh?
You haven't read me
right at all.
I see my life
and my service
with a clarity
you're incapable...
shit.
Shit!
Aah!
Shit!
Cover me!
Go!
Thought you were
a sharpshooter.
Save it.
Freeze China out if they
stand with north Korea.
All talks for
a grain deal cease
until they stand down.
If China wants grain,
I want our boys back.
You got 5 minutes, al.
I'm afraid it's going
to take longer than that.
It's bad news,
Mr. president.
It's still Jack, Alvin.
Nick spikings is dead.
What?
And he had evidence that
Kyle killed Carla town.
Spikings collected it.
They found a condom
with Kyle's semen
and the woman's
fingerprints on it.
They found
the murder weapon.
And a surveillance tape putting
Kyle and the woman together
just minutes
before the murder.
There's got to be
another explanation.
No, no.
And spikings was just about to
cut himself a deal to leak it.
Nick spikings?
He wouldn't
do that to me.
Everybody
has a price.
Not the first thing
in your life
you've been naive
about, is it, Jack?
Obviously not.
Well, you're safe now.
So's Kyle.
Spikings...
Was murdered.
Man on TV: Just get a bucket
and start getting the water
out of the boat,
you guys.
Second man: Mayday, this is the
ketch Rene off Turner point...
let's see what we got.
Jordan.
All right,
he goes out there.
Hey, we got a special on
that model this week, folks.
back off.
Sure. Only a couple left,
though.
Just so you know.
Regis: 20:16.
I can even throw in a universal
remote with that, you know?
Back off!
Sure, sure, take your time.
Just, uh, ask for Jack.
He comes in, and yet
he leaves... wait.
Who's that?
I know that guy.
That's the guy
that was at spikings'.
The 31st name.
Jordan walked him in.
Jordan set up
the whole thing.
Yeah.
Newscaster: The investigation
into the white house murder
has resulted in 2 suspects.
The car, a burgundy
Chevrolet caprice,
has been identified as
the possible suspect car.
In other news,
a strike is pending as
workers' contract talks...
There won't be anything
anyone can prove.
All the evidence
will be destroyed.
What do you want?
Your resignation.
Effective 10 P.M.
I don't know why you
look surprised, Jack.
Tully wasn't half-right
when he called it criminal.
Because we didn't go in
with guns blazing?
You think that would've
saved our boys?
You have failed,
Mr. president!
You have failed your
office pitifully.
I've seen your
cowardice grow
from the very
beginning.
And then, finally,
not having served your
country in the military,
you had no idea of
the time-honored code
of never leaving a man
on the field of battle.
You should've brought
those awacs boys home
dead, wounded,
or otherwise.
You should've done it
by force if necessary.
Any president who
serves up his country
as appetizers
for the enemy
isn't fit for this office.
So the choice is yours.
You can... you can resign.
Say it's due to your health.
And you can tour the best
golf clubs in America.
Or you can stay
in office,
and you can watch
your son destroyed.
The choice is yours.
I mean, if any father
can call that a choice.
Why didn't he just
kill Neil?
Because it's easier
to kill the secretary
than it is
the president.
Besides, alive
and ruined is better.
Than what?
Than dead and martyred.
Radio newscaster: And now
this special bulletin.
An oval office address is
scheduled for 10:00 tonight.
Unidentified sources say
the president will resign.
Jordan played his card.
Newscaster: In related news,
all federal...
all right,
that gives us 2 hours
to get to the white house
and the president.
Are you insane?
How?
We'll use the tunnels
the same way they got out.
You don't even know
where they are.
Yeah, but you do.
I mean, you know
the security,
and you know the layout.
You're out of your mind.
Why, because I'm about
to help a government
that's kicking me out
on the streets?
You got no argument there.
Regis: We got to get rid
of this car.
Hello.
Don't say my name.
Just listen.
Remember where we had
that homicide 2 weeks ago?
Stengel: Yeah.
Ok. Meet me there
in one hour.
Get down.
Cops.
That's the steam grate.
It'll take us to one of 3
points that are vulnerable
to penetration in
the white house.
Eisenhower put a water filtering
system down in there.
There's got to be
an alarm.
Yeah, there is.
It goes off
all the way across town.
The general services
building.
No white house,
no secret service.
Regis:
Response time?
Well, officially
But realistically 10 or 11.
By that time
we'll either be fired,
or we're going to be dead.
I was a park ranger
during that.
You?
What do you think?
Meet and greet time?
Ahem.
He said you did it, too.
Hold on.
Evening, officers.
Evening.
Tense night in
the big city, huh?
Yeah.
Could be this thing with
the president maybe, huh?
Nice to know, though,
that we have our
men in blue out here
to keep a watchful eye
over us.
Are you from Washington?
Ok.
Hey, didn't that old senator
lay the wood
to that stripper around
here somewhere years ago?
All right. Take it easy
this evening, huh?
Just asking.
Didn't see it on my...
my guide map.
Ok, we'll see you
later, all right?
All right, gentlemen.
Good night.
Good night.
Come on, come on.
Yes.
Go.
Regis: Be careful.
Come on, come on,
come on.
My grandmother moves
faster than you.
Nina: Wait.
Stengel: Where are we?
We're under the mall.
That's Pennsylvania Avenue.
Which way?
It's not far.
Oh, Christ.
Now what?
End of the line.
This is the old
emergency water system.
These pipes go
right through the wall.
Good, 'cause that's
where we're going.
After you're sworn in,
you'll make a short statement
saluting Jack Neil
for his service
to his country.
You'll ask for
the country's prayers
for bi-partisan unity.
Would you 2 excuse us
now, please?
Thank you very much.
Gentlemen,
at 2400 hours,
president Dylan
will sign off
on the raid
into north Korea.
Nina: We're looking for
a steel door.
What do you got?
Army corps of engineers.
These are
the escape tunnels.
Lincoln had these built
in case the confederates
laid siege to the white house.
Who says history
isn't practical?
We're running
out of time.
Go.
You first.
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.
What the... whoa.
Regis: You hear that?
Oh, Jesus!
Oh, Christ.
Oh, stengel.
Go ahead. I'll be ok.
Ok.
Hang in there,
all right?
Aah!
Uhh!
Uhh!
Uhh!
We got to cross over.
Newswoman: Tonight,
in less than an hour,
Jack Neil will step down
after a little more
than 2 years in office.
For CNN, I'm Doris MacMillan
reporting.
Let's do this.
Ok, wait.
We're here.
These are motion sensors.
They trip the alarm
in the white house.
We set those off and this
room fills up with agents.
How long?
We've come too far
to turn back now.
Yeah.
I'll hold them off
as long as I can.
Movement in 102.
Repeat, movement in 102.
Subsector-11 tunnels.
Repeat, tunnels,
subsector-11.
Move! Get out of the way!
You're under arrest!
Drop your weapon!
Agent: Check the corridor
all the way down.
Second agent:
Checking subsector grade.
Agent: Yo, go!
Agent: Cover sector-12.
Got it.
Freeze! Hold it!
Ok, on the ground.
On the ground!
Get on the ground.
Agent: Clear sector 7
right now.
Report back to me only.
Let's go.
What agent captured?
Get her up here.
Not now.
Hold it.
Let me see some I.D.
Agent, gun!
The janitor!
Jordan.
Agent: Get down!
Get down!
Get him!
He killed spikings!
Mr. president!
Your son is innocent!
Sir, you can't
be here.
I am here.
Seal the corridor.
I am still the president!
Seal the corridor!
Alvin Jordan,
you're under arrest
for conspiracy in
the murder of Carla town
and Nicholas spikings.
You have the right
to remain silent.
Anything you say can
and will be held against you
in a court of law.
You have the right
to an attorney.
If you can't afford one,
you prick,
one will be appointed
by the courts.
How did you get in here?
I crawled.
He's the one who gave spikings
the evidence on your son.
Regis: The evidence
is you on tape
with the man you walked
in to kill Carla town.
The same man who put a bullet
through Nicholas spikings.
Stand him up.
You don't have
to believe me.
Just look at the tape.
It's in my back.
Agent?
Mr. president, Carla
town was killed
to destroy you.
To force your
resignation.
Then Jordan had
spikings shot
because
he saw the tape.
Arrest him.
What?
Not him.
Him.
My god, Alvin.
You really had her killed,
didn't you?
I think president Teddy
Roosevelt said it best.
If I must choose between
righteousness and peace,
I choose righteousness.
She was 25 years old.
She was a child.
She was a casualty of war.
Mr. president.
Get him out of here.
Thank you, son.
Gun!
Nina, just stay easy.
Stay easy.
Just stay easy.
I'm right here.
All right, hold on.
No, there's absolutely
no truth whatsoever
to any of those rumors.
At no time was
president Neil planning
on resigning from office.
Here's what we know so far.
The murderer of Carla town
is dead.
He was killed today
as he fired upon authorities
attempting to arrest him.
In that same gun battle,
national security advisor
Alvin Jordan
and senior secret service
agent Nicholas spikings
were also killed.
Did the killer actually
penetrate the white house
with the objective
of killing miss town?
In 180 years,
there has never been a
penetration of the white house.
President and Mrs. Neil will
have a statement for you later.
Thank you very much.
Call D.C. homicide.
Tell them the detective
we found in the tunnel
is on his way to
university hospital.
Paramedics say
he's going to be fine.
Neil: How is she?
She's stable.
You saved my life.
Thank you.
And detective,
how can I ever repay you?
Mmm, don't bother.
Just doing my job.
Well,
there is one thing.
Yes, detective?
Have you ever heard of the
interstate commerce commission?
Sure.
Secretary Randall's office
is right down the street.
Right down the street?
Yeah.
See? It's not
what you know,
it's who you know.
What are you doing
for dinner?
What... what... i mean,
I'm not trying to...
