Your tonsils out your asshole.
What do you think
Of them apples, huh?
Stop! Stop!
Hey, mister...
Get the hell off my truck!
- Keep goin'
Before you get killed. -
I'm gonna give you
Till the count of five!
One, two, four...
Bull's-eye!
Mister? Jesus.
I'm sorry. Damn you.
Now come on!
Come on, come on.
Come on.
Whoo!
Whoo!
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!
- Oh, shit. - hey, caleb?
Fasten your fuckin'
Seat belt!
Son of a bitch!
No! -
Whoo-hoo!
It's time to pay The fiddler.
Where's my sister, jess?
I taught severen
Everything he knew,
But not everything I know.
The last sound that you hear
On your way to hell...
Is gonna be your guts
Snappin' like a bullwhip.
This ain't got nothin'
To do with my sister!
You leave her out of this
And let her go!
Jesse, let him come back.
It's too late for that, Mae.
Goddamn, jesse,
Where's my sister?
Everything is gonna be
All right.
Don't be scared.
- I'm gonna take her back.
- Sure you will.
Caleb, look out!
Jess!
Hey!
Go, caleb.
Make a run for it.
Come on, jesse!
Get in the car! Mae, come on!
Hurry up!
Get in the car!
Go on! Aah!
Go on, honey. Go on. Run.
Run, sarah!
No!

Block that sun out!

No!
Caleb!
Wait, sarah!
My god.
Jesse.
Roast.
Fun times.
Caleb, what's happening?
I brought you home.
I'm afraid. Don't be.
It's just the sun.
