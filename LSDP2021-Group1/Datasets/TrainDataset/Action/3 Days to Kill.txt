Mr. Director, this is
Agent Vivian Delay.
For the last ten years, the
Central Intelligence Agency
- has been after Wolfgang Braun.
- The Wolf.
As you know, we have no positive
identification on what the Wolf looks like.
What we do know is he's a
former German national
who sells atomic material to
terrorists all over the world.
Intelligence confirms that a
transaction is to take place
next week in Belgrade.
The Wolf's number one
man, the Albino,
will be selling a dirty
bomb to Syrian buyers.
We've already dispatched a
team to eliminate the buyers,
secure the bomb, and
apprehend the Albino.
How may I be of service, sir?
Your target is the Wolf.
We have reason to believe
he'll be present.
Find him and eliminate him.
Yes, sir.
Let them get the Albino,
you get the Wolf.
Oh, sir, if I may,
who is our agent on the ground?
The buyers have been neutralized.
Well done, Ethan. Well done.
Maid service. I have
your extra towels.
This cold is killing me.
- Yeah?
- You left a big mess.
I'm thinking about calling in sick.
Come on, you haven't had
a sick day in 32 years.
- Here's the scanner.
- Thank you, Yasmin.
Uh... be sure to stock my bedroom with
those little shampoo bottles, I like them.
All teams in position.
Excuse me.
Nice work in there, my man.
Oh... it's Zooey's birthday.
I need a second to make a call.
Cell phones aren't secure, Ethan.
Yeah, well, it's my daughter.
You've got a payphone outside,
you've got five minutes.
Let's see the scan.
Hey, hey, listen I'm trying to
make a phone call over there and
I don't have any change so if I could
borrow some out of this money.
I can come back and
I can pay you back.
Come on, come on.
Son of a bitch.
All right, this is worth a lot.
I take some of this.
I'm coming back for that.
Excuse me.
Have we met before?
You would remember me, no?
Karachi!
Yasmin's been compromised.
We need to move now, Axel!
No one moves on the Albino
until we have cleared
what's in the box. Come on.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. We met in
Karachi last April exactly.
But then you were working
as a cocktail waitress
if I remember it correctly?
- Oh, shit.
- We got confirmation.
That's a dirty bomb.
- Hi sweetie, it's your father.
You didn't forget, which
means you probably love me.
Of course I do, Zooey.
You can prove it by singing me
"Happy Birthday, " loudly.
Well, I could sweetheart,
but, uh, I'm at work.
You can leave a message
after the beep.
What the f...?
All right.
Go, go! Get in position! Cover me!
Cover Ethan now!
We're going in! We're going in!
Cover Ethan! Cover Ethan!
All right, that's enough.
Put it down.
Now.
Now slide it over here.
You're not going to
kill me, are you?
Not unless I have to, all right?
But I'm not running after
you anymore, fucker.
Ohh...
I see you've read the report.
- It's called Glioblastoma.
- Yeah.
It's a type of brain cancer and
it's spread to your lungs.
It doesn't say how
much time I have left.
Three months, possibly five.
Yeah.
So, no Christmas this year, huh?
I'm afraid not.
I suggest you put your
affairs in order.
Thank you, doctor.
Well done securing the bomb, Ethan.
But now that you're no
longer operational,
we need to terminate
our relationship.
We've wired your pension
into your account.
The CIA thanks you
for your service.
What the...?
- What are you doing in my place?
- You do not speak French?
No, I'm American. I...
- I live here.
- Which floor?
No, I mean, I live here.
You? You are the owner?
I'm so happy to finally meet you.
This is my wife, Teresa.
My son Abbate.
My daughter Sumia is in the
kitchen, she's pregnant.
These are my cousins.
They are visiting us from Mali.
Until they go to stay with
my brother in Saint-Denis.
- Do you know Saint Denis?
- No, I don't know Saint Denis.
- What are you doing in my apartment?
- We were without a home.
We were seeking shelter.
You are lucky we're here.
- Bad spirit fill empty spaces.
- Yeah, but now I'm back.
And it is good that you are
finally back. My name is Jules.
Ethan.
Where's all my stuff?
I also started to paint the room.
My wife think it is best
to have a cheerful color.
Is yellow good for you? I'm happy to do
the work. It's not a problem, Ethan.
Actually, Jules,
there is a problem.
That's months from now.
Then I guess I need to
throw them out myself.
No, no, no, hey, ho.
I'll go to... Hey! I'll go to jail?
All right, what exactly
then am I supposed to do?
Did you really just say that to me?
Ethan, Ethan!
I need to talk to your dad.
Psst!
Please give me a minute
to finish my call.
- I'm sorry, Ethan.
- Let's talk in private, Jules, in my room.
I can assure you, we have not
touched any of your things.
I'm not saying you did, but
I think it's time you and I
got to know each other
just a little better.
'Cause you're not just
crashing at some guy's house.
No problem, Ethan. We
will pack and leave now.
Where are you gonna go
with a pregnant kid?
I don't know, but we'll
leave without packing.
Sit down.
You don't have to go
yet, Jules, at least...
not until your
daughter has her baby.
But you stay under my rules.
- I am also a believer in rules.
- Rule #1, no one steps in this room again.
No one. Absolutely.
I'll put a bigger sign.
That's right, you
put a bigger sign.
Rule #2, you always do what
I say, no questions asked.
Yes, of course.
And rule #3, you don't
ever paint my room again.
- You don't like the color?
- No.
I told my wife yellow
is not a man's color.
No, yellow is not a man's color.
- So you also have a daughter?
- Yes.
Like Sumia.
OK, OK, no more yellow.
Who is the most beautiful
girl in the world?
- Is that you?
- Look, Daddy!
Hey, , Christine.
Hi, you.
Hey.
- This is Christine.
- Hello, Tina. It's me.
I'm in town.
I'm in a meeting right now, so
this is not a good time to talk.
I don't want to talk.
I want to see you.
Yeah, I'm exceptionally busy,
so, uh... unless it's urgent
I've got some legal stuff I need you
to look at before I leave town.
Why?
- Are you getting married?
- No, why, are you?
No, not today.
All right, I'll meet you outside.
OK, see ya.
Why are we really here, Ethan?
I wanted to see you.
And our daughter, you
want to see her too?
Yes. Yes.
I started a college fund.
Why the sudden interest?
It's not sudden, Tina.
I try to stay in touch.
I left her a message
on her birthday.
Yes, and now she'll have to wait
another year to hear from you again.
I'm dying, Tina.
- You think this is easy for me?
- No, I'm...
I'm sick.
I mean, I'm dying.
Sorry it took so long,
but I'm afraid your will
must be signed in both
French and English.
I don't want Zooey to know,
at least not right away.
Come on in.
It's nice.
The place looks better than before.
Don't look too hard.
It's falling apart.
I know I haven't done
right by you and Zooey.
I want to see her before I go.
You have to make me a promise.
I'll let you see her
under one condition.
Are you done?
Are you really done
working for them?
- Yes.
- Promise me.
Yes. I missed a lot.
I should have left a long time ago.
I'm gonna be fine.
I've got the whole
day planned. First...
Oh, no, no, sweetheart, no.
She has her own plans.
You'll just have to catch up.
Hi, sweetie!
Hi.
Hi, Zooey.
How are you?
I'm good, how are you?
I'm good, thank you.
- OK.
- Mom, please don't cry. I'm fine.
No, I'm just... I'll be
back home at 8:30. Yeah?
What are we supposed to do?
All right, how about I cook?
You're on.
So you want me to call you Dad
or should I just call you Ethan?
I think I like Dad.
Favorite place to go after school?
I didn't know we had
a favorite place.
Flying chairs, remember?
Look, Ethan, we don't need
to do this, all right?
I know you probably want to talk
and get to know each other.
That's why I transferred
back here to Paris.
Look, I'm not mad
at you, all right?
I don't need you to explain any of
this, all right? It's not a big deal.
Come on, Zoe, let's go to the cafe.
Hugh, I want you to meet Ethan.
Who?
- I'm Zooey's father.
- Oh! Hello.
No.
Well, great to meet you,
Ethan... Mr. Renner.
Sorry, sometimes I
just get a bit nervous
when I see American cowboys.
Yee-haw!
OK.
He's older than you.
Yeah, he's a senior.
Is there something wrong with that?
Back when I was
growing up if you...
Hugh is so different than you.
Look, I know I'm blowing
it here, Zooey, I...
Look, I...
thought you might want
to ride this home.
- Wow, is this for me?
- Yeah.
It's... so purple.
Yeah, it's your favorite color.
Right, when I was like nine.
I'm taking the metro
with my friends.
All right, so I'll see
you at home for dinner?
Zooey, I'll see you
at home for dinner?
- How are these?
- Fresh.
They're fresh? I just need
to steam them, right?
Don't forget to soak it in milk.
Milk?
Only if you plan to fry it.
Haven't got that far.
I like a man that doesn't pretend
to know his way around the kitchen.
Yeah, well, you're talking
to the right guy.
Yes...
I think I am.
Well, I'm soaking tuna in milk and
thanks to you, frying
it for my daughter.
So today is Zooey's lucky day?
What did you say your name was?
You can call me Vivi.
Nice running into you,
Vivi, but not interested.
Maybe we could talk?
My wife gave me this.
Come on, cheri,
let's go for a drive.
All right, but my
bike's coming with me.
The bike's going with me.
Who exactly do you work for, Vivi?
I work for the director of the CIA.
Wouldn't know about the top shelf.
Serbia was my operation.
I was looking for the Wolf.
We believe he was at
the hotel that day,
and I believe that you
may have seen him.
- Wait a minute.
- And I'm willing to bet
that when you see him again
you'll recognize him.
I want you to come work for me.
Not a chance.
I've already got plans.
Don't you think Zooey deserves
to have her daddy around
for more than just a
few measly months?
Jesus!
That was really close.
In exchange for your cleaning services,
I could offer you an experimental drug.
Interested?
This, Ethan,
could extend your life.
Where's the literature?
You know, the test results.
How come no one's told
me about this before?
Because you weren't worth
the cost of treatment.
Wow. You make me feel so special.
- You weren't. But now you are.
- Why?
Because you're sick and dead
men have nothing to lose.
I have access to
many things, Ethan,
but only you can give
me access to the Wolf.
I need you to find him...
and I need you to kill him.
So I buy back my life
by killing for you?
When did you become
so self-righteous?
Jesus Christ, I just wanna be sure that
we're talking about the same thing here.
You know, killing.
There's a man inside that works
for the Wolf's accountant.
I'm gonna need you
to start right away.
Well, I got a fish
to fry and I'm late.
I can get you in home in
time for dinner, Ethan.
Question is...
do you want your bike back?
- Pretty public place.
- Meaning?
Meaning a silencer would...
be handy.
So, how many guys are
we talking about?
One.
Knock 'em dead.
Yeah, well, that's
the point, isn't it?
Grenade!
Pretty good for a jobber.
You said there'd be
one guy, not five.
Oops.
But I did say keep the young
man with the mustache alive.
What do you think
this guy looks like?
- Middle-aged.
- Not a chance.
- Tell her how old you are.
- I am...
Make an effort, all right?
I'm trying to save your life.
- Now tell her how old you are.
- I'm 32.
- Middle-aged.
- Jesus Christ!
Now this...
is a young man with a mustache.
No, that's a goatee.
That's a mustache and some stubble.
- That's a goatee.
- That's a goatee?
That's a mustache, all right?
This is a goatee.
- That's a shadow.
- It looks French.
- Since when?
- That's a goatee...
What, from your century, grandpa?
Look at that, that's a mustache.
All right, so what about
the rest of these guys?
- Hmm?
- Oh, my...
Who are all these other guys here?
- I don't know.
- And that doesn't bother you?
Nope.
Because I usually like to know the
person I'm killing needs to be dead.
And that's why you never made
it to the top shelf, my friend.
Goatee, you're up.
I'm looking for the accountant.
When does he get back to Paris?
I don't know, I swear.
Kill him.
Hold on, I can get
this guy to talk.
He didn't know.
Goddamn it.
Do you even have a line
that can't be crossed?
I'm gonna need a significant raise.
I wanna leave my daughter more
than just my shit pension.
Look, I'll close at 25 but I'm gonna
cap you to half a dozen kills.
Half a dozen?
I'm already halfway there.
We've all been asked
to tighten our belts.
Don't take this the wrong way,
Viv, but you're not my type.
I'm everybody's type.
- You... Are you sure this works?
- No.
But I am sure that if you don't try
it, you'll be dead in two months.
It's 50 thousand, not 25.
And you're giving me credit for
those three guys upstairs.
And I'm also gonna want a...
I'm gonna need a million
dollar life insurance policy.
Take it or leave it.
I'll take it.
I like the package.
All right, now do it.
Breathe, Ethan.
It will hit you morphine-quick.
One way or another...
I will make you feel better.
Don't forget to soak the fish.
You promised me my bike.
Zooey!
- Zooey! Are you OK?
- No, I'm not OK.
Look at this.
This looks terrible.
I think your... Your hair?
No, no. Yes. Yes, my hair.
I look like a freaking Chia Pet.
It looks, uh, awesome.
- Really?
- Yeah.
You think this can go to prom?
Well, if you're going you might
as well take it with you.
- Oh, is that some kind of joke?
- No, no, I mean...
All these times, now's
the time to say a joke?
No, I mean, maybe...
- Maybe we can fix your hair.
- Fix it? You can fix this?
No, you can... You could wash it...
You could sleep on it and,
look, tomorrow it will be...
It'll be back to normal,
all right? Maybe?
- You really think so?
- Yeah.
Why don't we pick up some dinner?
Hey. Don't offer to cook dinner if
you're going to be three hours late.
Look, I'm sorry, Tina, but I was...
Save it. I was crazy to
think I could count on you.
I was gonna ask you to look after
Zooey while I go to London for work.
Then, go.
Really, you should
go, I can handle it.
You can't handle dinner. How are
you gonna handle a teenager?
How about I just diffused a
major meltdown. Her hair, OK?
I have to take the first
flight out tomorrow morning.
I'm calling a sitter.
I was late because I found
a doctor who can help me.
- What?
- There's, um...
There's a specialist
here in Paris who has
a experimental drug she's
willing to test on me.
Experimental.
What exactly does that mean?
It means I might be able to spend a
little more time with you and Zooey.
You should have called, Ethan,
because I was going to kill you.
Can we just, like, maybe
quit fighting for a second.
Maybe not talk about
killing someone? Me.
I could grill us up
some of this tuna.
- Tuna?
- Yeah.
- Tuna.
- With all that mercury?
No way!
You're gonna fix that door, right?
Oh. Um...
Yeah, that was a mistake.
You haven't been here 24 hours.
I hope the sofa is going
to be comfortable.
Yeah. Better than a cot in Karachi.
Do you need something
to help you sleep?
Yeah, I'm gonna need it now.
You're terrible.
What the hell did you give me?
- You're not coming over?
- No. I'm dizzy.
My head... My head's dizzy.
Vivi.
- Read the manual.
- Wait! I'm hallucinating.
I'm hallucinating.
- What?
Vodka. It'll take the edge off.
Is everything OK?
Yeah.
- I had a little trouble finding the vodka.
- Huh.
Listen, you can call
me anytime you want.
It's only a one hour difference
between Paris and London.
- There you are.
- And you can call me, too.
- I love you.
- All right.
I'll be back in a couple
of days, I'm running late.
- Your daddy has a list.
- Kind of a big list.
- Washing powder...
- I'll see you guys!
- Have fun!
- ...for black clothes.
Zooey, come on, breakfast.
Look at me. Come on.
Just one time up here. One time.
Atta girl.
Zooey!
Oh.
What?
Wow, it's...
- It's what?
- Geez.
- So, what, Ethan?
- It's...
It's so red.
Vivi?
Are you going to get that?
Sorry. Nobody important,
just my boss, Vivi.
Was she the one calling you
in the middle of the night?
We talk a lot because we
sell internationally.
It's always daytime somewhere.
All right, so now we've
got three days to kill.
What are you doing?
It's called a ringtone, Ethan.
I'm giving you mine.
Maybe we can talk more
than once a year.
There. Welcome to this century.
Zooey. Zooey.
Don't you want to ride
your bike to school?
You think Hugh's gonna
like my hair color?
Yes, I do.
- Really?
- Yes.
- You think he'll really love it?
- Well, if he cares about you he will.
So you don't love it?
No.
No, I mean, yes, Zooey.
Zooey, I really love it.
Awesome.
I can see you don't
believe in the customary
forty-eight-hour
window between kills.
Well, you only have
three days left.
I'm not getting into
your car, Vivi.
Not until I get a second opinion on
that whatever it was you gave me.
- I told you it's kosher.
- No, it's not.
- Aw.
- The manual says,
if you'd bothered to read it,
you'd find out if I can't
keep my heart rate lower,
that shit's gonna act
like a hallucinogen.
So keep your heart rate low.
Yeah, well, it's kind of hard
with the job you got me doing.
Get in the car already.
I need you to locate
the Italian accountant
who cooks the books for
your old friend the Albino.
How am I supposed
to locate this guy?
With the help of this man.
His name is Mitat Yilmaz.
He runs a limo service
that caters to the Albino.
Get to know him, he'll lead you
straight to the accountant.
All right.
- And, Ethan?
- Yeah?
Lose the bike.
- Buy a suit.
- Why?
So, you understand we are
a luxury car service, right?
- Yeah.
- How did you come to hear of us?
An Albino told me.
Did he also tell you that
we offer discreet luxury?
He told me not to talk to the
hired help, to talk to the boss.
We're not the help, OK? We are the
executive vice president of sales.
Ooohh!
You're a couple of turds.
Listen, asshole...
little piece of turd,
you're nobody to us.
And you will never meet
the boss. Understand?
All right, I'm sorry.
Yeah.
I had a really weird
night, you know,
a couple of weird nights.
Jetlagged.
I think maybe we got off on
the wrong foot. My fault.
Yeah.
Can we start again?
Let's start again.
Jesus Christ, I'm starting to think
you can see the Eiffel Tower from
everywhere in this town.
You are a very rude man
to sit behind my desk
without an invitation, Mr...?
Why are names important right now?
Because I don't want
to kill a total stranger.
What do you want
to kill me for, Mitat?
You are sitting in my chair.
I'm just waiting for you.
The Albino sent you, huh? Bastard!
I've always been loyal. Please...
- These your girls in the picture?
- How dare you look at them?!
Sit down. I also have a
pretty teenage daughter.
Father to father, your girls ever
lock themselves in
their room, you know?
Cut their hair,
paint it red, you know?
Put wigs on and shit like that?
No. Never.
I knew it! I'm in trouble.
- So the Albino didn't send you to kill me?
- No.
Then who are you?
Ethan. Come on.
I'm gonna have a conversation
with this man in the bathroom.
I do not want to be disturbed.
Yes. Rule #2: Do whatever you say.
That's right, Rule #2.
- He's a bad guy?
- Something like that.
And you are a good guy?
You are a professional, huh?
Why have I never seen
you in Paris before?
I've been away on business
for about five years.
What is so important that you'd
leave your daughter so long?
Well, I was never good at
balancing work and family.
You know, when I go home,
this life, the killing, the
rest it all disappears.
I made the wrong choice leaving.
Everyday I bring my girls to school
and I have dinner with my family.
That's the key.
Oh, good for you, Mitat.
So let's not miss
dinner tonight, hmm?
When is the accountant
arriving in Paris?
Please remind me, who is he again?
- Hello?
- Hello, Mrs. Driskal here.
I'd like to have a word
with Zooey's father.
I'm Zooey's father.
Is she all right?
Zooey's fine, but we need to meet.
We need to have a conversation
about Zooey's behavior.
I can be there right away.
Well, do hurry.
We're going to school.
As I was saying to Zooey,
study after study has shown that
aggression is exacerbated by
violent images in popular culture.
Well, Zooey's mother raised
her to be a pacifist.
Hm.
Hitting a classmate in the face
is hardly a passive response.
With an open hand
or a clenched fist?
- What difference does that make?
- Well, from my experience,
anger, frustration, insult,
they all call for...
they all call for
different responses.
Mr. Renner,
it's extremely important
that you send your
daughter a clear message
that no matter what she
has to confront in life
violence is not an
acceptable answer.
Ru try.
If that wasn't so weird, it would have
been really embarrassing, Ethan.
- Let me see your hand.
- What?
Let me see your hand, Zooey.
Ow, my thumb.
If you're gonna hit someone
with a clenched fist
be sure to not tuck your thumb in.
You've been gone for five years
and this is what you say to me?
Oh, God.
- Are you Muslim?
- No.
I told you this is my boss's car.
- Oh, so Vivi's Muslim?
- No.
- I'm plugging in my phone. This stuff sucks.
- I know.
I like this, who are these guys?
- Do you even care why I got into a fight?
- Let me out!
Why can't you just listen to
me and try to understand?
OK, why don't you
tell me all about it?
I have a new friend from Pakistan,
and there's this British girl
who keeps calling her Paki.
Today she put bacon in her locker,
so I hit her in the face.
Well, she won't do
that again, will she?
Just a second, sweetie, sounds like
the spare's loose in the trunk.
Hey!
I'm trying to have a
conversation with my daughter.
I'm... I'm sorry, sweetie,
now where were we?
- Punching the girl, right?
- I feel really bad.
Well, don't, because sometimes it's
the only way to stop a bad guy.
- So you're not mad at me?
- No, I'm not mad at you.
I'm proud of you, you
stuck up for your friend.
Whatever. I'm taking the metro.
- And, Ethan?
- Yeah.
You might want to take something
for that cough. It's really annoying.
Jesus Christ!
Let's see if we can jump
start your memory, Mitat.
It's my daughter.
- Zooey?
- Hey. Sorry about earlier.
That's OK, honey. I'm sorry, too.
Favorite place to hang
out after school?
I'll wrap my sales meeting and
meet you at 3:30, sweetie.
She just invited me to hang out.
What do you think about that?
A girl like this will keep
you running in circles.
You must draw the
line, not be so soft.
You're right, Mitat.
I have been way too soft.
Now, where do I find the
Albino's accountant, hmm?
Hi, Zooey.
It's 3:40, Ethan. Where are you?
I'm on my bike, sweetie.
Forget it, you're always
late. I'm leaving.
No, no, no, I'm almost
there, honestly, Zooey.
Give me...
Give me five minutes.
Fine, five minutes.
I have homework.
Wow.
Kids.
It's just Hugh and the prom
and you came into town.
This is really new for
both of us. I get it.
So, favorite place to go after
Flying Chairs, you remember?
- I remember.
- Kind of?
- Yeah.
- OK.
Gosh, the bike.
What's going on, Ethan?
It's just some flu I picked up.
Can't seem to shake it off.
What if it's something worse?
No, it's, uh...
It's nothing worse.
You remember when we'd drink hot
chocolate at the beach house?
Sort of.
It's the one place I
wouldn't mind calling home.
- More than Pittsburgh, really?
- Yeah, more than Pittsburgh.
You know, I kept all our
home movies in a box.
How about we make dinner
and watch them tonight?
- Yeah, that'd be awesome.
- Good.
Oh, shoot, I forgot. I have
to go to Karina's tonight.
- Who?
- Karina, she's my lab partner.
We're doing a science project together.
I'm going to spend the night.
- On a school night?
- Yeah. I'm sorry, Ethan, I'm really sorry.
No, it's OK. It's just...
Don't I need to call
her parents first?
Yeah, if you speak Russian.
That's all her parents understand.
Look, call Mom.
She'll tell you it's cool.
I don't need to call your mom.
- Can we watch those movies tomorrow?
- Yeah, sure.
See you later.
Hi, this is Christine, I'm not
here, so please leave a message.
Tina, it's me.
Can you believe Zooey and I
hung out on flying chairs
and we had hot chocolate
and it was her idea?
Thanks for all this, Tina.
You're a really great mom.
Hi, I'm thrilled
everything's going so well.
Well, I've never heard of her
nor her Russian parents.
Zooey!
Son of a bitch!
Is this your car?
... Is this your car?
- Whoa.
- No.
Hey! You know the rule.
Never involve family.
This isn't a business
meeting, Mitat, this is...
This is more of a
father-to-father type of visit.
- It's dinner time.
- Mitat?
- Do you know this man, Mitat?
- Yeah, we work together.
- Never seen him before.
- It's an American.
OK. Come, come with us.
Thanks for that.
This is Rachelle, Sarah.
I have a serious problem
with my daughter, Zooey.
You've been gone for five years
and you did not expect trouble?
- We cannot help you.
- That's right, you probably can't.
But your girls might be
able to tell me where
a 16-year-old would go to
party on a school night.
What does this "spider" mean?
They are good girls,
they do not party.
What does this "spider" mean?
La Soiree House.
- How do you know that?
- Thank you.
I have a daughter in there.
Zooey.
Zooey!
Stop, please, please.
Stop, please.
Ethan!
Ethan!
Ethan! Please!
Come on, Zooey. Come on.
I got you, honey.
What are you doing here?
Better question, Zooey, is,
what were you doing last night?
God, this is so embarrassing. They'll
never let me in there again.
Why would you ever want to go
back to a place like that?
Because I like being
with my friends.
Your friends?
Do you even remember what happened?
In the bathroom?
- Zooey!
- What?
In the bathroom, do you
remember what happened?
Look, Karina and I aced
the practice test, OK?
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, we did.
So we decided to go hang
out with some friends.
I've gotta go catch the metro,
I'm gonna be late for school.
- You're not going to the metro.
- What?
You're not going to school today.
Not dressed like that.
You're putting this on
and we're going home.
- We're gonna have a talk.
- How exactly am I supposed to get home?
- Gonna ride this bike.
- I don't think so, Ethan.
You're getting on this bike and I'm
gonna follow you every step of the way.
- No, you're not.
- Stop talking and get on the bike.
I thought that's what you
wanted to do, Ethan, talk!
Get on this bike.
- Or what?
- Now!
I don't even know how
to ride a bike, OK?
What kind of kid doesn't
know how to ride a bike?
The kind of kid who never
had a father to teach her.
Goddamn it.
This is the flattest spot, so
let's just try it right here.
Gosh, did you have to get
the biggest bike there?
It's not the biggest bike,
Zooey, it's a girl's bike.
Right, you picked it 'cause
it had the big bow on it.
No. I can explain the big
bow, I got it. Get on.
There's too many people. Look,
can we go somewhere private?
- Gosh.
- There's not too many people.
But it's purple.
It is purple. Get on.
- How do you even get on it?
- Just get on.
Wow, we did it. We're
halfway there. We're on it.
Give yourself time to push here, OK?
It's right here then. All right?
Zooey, all right.
- Whoa. OK?
- OK.
- Good.
- Easy, please.
OK, I have you. Now, just
kinda, you know how to pedal.
- Yes. I'm right here.
- Why is it so high?
Don't let go. I'm gonna...
Look, I traveled a lot, sweetheart,
and your mother and I...
There is no easy...
There's no good answer, honey.
All right.
- Do you have another family?
- No. No, sweetheart. I didn't. Come on.
- Is that what it is?
Do you have another perfect
daughter somewhere?
Did you see me and not want me?
- Do you not love me?
- No, sweetheart, no, that's not it.
Well, why did it take so
long for you to come back?
Look!
it felt like the harder
it was to come back.
OK, OK, all right.
That's all. It's nothing
to do with you.
Would you still care about
me if I did horrible things?
Yes, of course.
Absolutely.
I lie a lot. Like, all the
time about everything.
Even when I don't need to.
I don't know why.
Well, you know, sometimes that's
easier than telling the truth.
That girl I hit at school, she
wasn't teasing a Pakistani friend.
She was hitting on Hugh.
- It's all right, he prefers soccer.
- Yeah.
Hugh!
These are so beautiful, thank you!
Give me one sec,
I'll be right back.
Ethan, don't say anything weird.
- You rave, Hugh?
- What?
- You rave?
- No, no way, Mr. Zoe.
I'm an athlete. I'm a striker.
Last game I scored two
goals, by the way.
- So you like to score?
- Yeah, yeah, definitely, yeah.
No! Well, I... I... I
mean on the field.
- Yeah.
- On the field only, yeah.
- Soccer?
- Yeah.
Not a fan. I'm from Pittsburgh,
where we play real football.
- Oh yeah, American football.
- No.
Real football.
OK.
Nice bike.
- You like the bike?
- Yeah.
You're the only one.
I won't be home late, Ethan.
- Where are you two going?
- School.
Great, well, I'm headed
that direction myself.
No, you're not.
Yeah, well, I could be.
I'm going to the market.
Oh, OK, well, I'm gonna...
OK, see you later, Mr. Zooey.
I don't like being called that.
You don't like Hugh?
I'm in, uh, sales, sweetie.
It's my business to read people.
You know, a lot of my friends'
dads are in sales, Ethan,
and not one of them
dresses like you.
What are you saying?
I'm saying they wear suits.
That's what they wear to work.
Hey, I love you!
- Haven't I helped you enough?
- You know the drill.
The accountant checked out. I need
you to tell me where he is now.
- I gave him to you yesterday.
- I know you did.
And now you're back.
I thought you were a pro.
I'm suddenly a single dad.
It's getting complicated.
Is it my fault if your
daughter is out of control
and affecting your
work and judgment?
You're right, Mitat. It
is affecting my judgment.
'Cause you should have
been dead a long time ago.
Hey, my wife works late. I need
to pick up my girls at 4:30.
I can't promise, but
I'll make an effort.
Open up.
I can't get around your mirror.
Fine, asshole.
Yes!
Ethan! Ethan!
That briefcase has the routing codes
to the Albino's accounts, doesn't it?
Yeah.
Do not open! The lock has
an explosive trigger.
I got the codes to the briefcase. Give
me the codes to the trigger, Guido.
But after I give it to
you, you will kill me.
No, but I swear to God I'm
gonna really torture you
- if you make me count to three.
- No.
- OK, one...
- Oh, no.
- ...two
- No.
No.
- Zooey?
- Ethan, so listen,
I was thinking about tonight.
Sweetie, I'm gonna be home on time for
dinner, all right? I promise. Now, can I...
- Can I call you back?
- I want to make dinner for Hugh tonight.
Just the two of you, like a...
- ...romantic dinner?
And I want to make him
real spaghetti sauce
but I don't know what I
need besides tomatoes.
I can't find Mom,
so I need your help.
Just a sec, sweetie.
Guido, are you a real Italian?
What?
I mean, are you a real Italian?
I mean, were you born there?
Yes. Catania, Sicily.
Could she have a recipe for sauce?
Sauce?
Yeah, sauce, you know, sauce.
- Is that code?
- No, it's not code.
- You just said you're a real Italian, right?
Si, so you must know a little
something about spaghetti sauce!
Ah! Spaghetti sauce! Red or white?
- Red or white?
- Red, vegetable, not too spicy.
Vegetarian, not too spicy.
OK, I know what to tell her.
Sweetie, it just so happens I'm in a
meeting here with a real live Italian.
His mama has a great recipe.
He wants to give it to you.
His name is Guido.
Why don't you say
hello to my daughter.
Hello. I am Guido.
Hi, Guido, this will
only take a second.
No, no!
- Please take all the time you want.
- Who's Guido?
No, no, no.
So, this is my mama's
favorite reduction sauce.
You will need tomatoes,
capers and garlic.
She always uses tomatoes
from her garden.
Your mom has a garden?
That is so cool.
Yes, she worked all her life
so I could go to school,
and now I am the only one
left to take care of her.
What else, Guido?
Heat the olive oil,
crush the garlic.
Then you peel the tomatoes.
After ten minutes, no more,
add capers and parsley.
And my mama's secret
is a cup of red wine
and a teaspoon of sugar.
Boy, that Guido's a
real mama's boy, huh?
I think it's sweet that he loves
his mother. Thanks, Ethan.
- Remember, don't get home too early.
- OK.
No, wait!
Oh, please call her back.
I wanted to give her my mama's
favorite recipe for cannoli.
You know how to tell time?
Where's the one?
Where's the three?
That's two hours.
You cut this guy
loose in two hours.
Guido, remind me where you're
going after this kid lets you go.
I'm going back home
to live with Mama!
You're late.
I'm in the middle of
a training session.
Yeah, I... I can see that.
Job's done.
- You're no fun.
- Not really.
Sit down.
Or did you forget why you came?
- Champagne?
- I don't think so.
You're just an American girl having
a good time in Paris, aren't you?
Who doesn't love Paris?
Now that we've
bankrupted the Albino,
he'll come running back to Paris
with his tail between his legs,
leading us straight to the Wolf.
When?
Very soon.
You can't go dressed like that.
What's wrong with how I dress?
What are you, , 42 long?
Yes.
- Take it off.
- Excuse me?
Shoes, everything. Let's go.
- What's going on?
- Baby.
Baby?
You let that guy go, right?
You didn't hurt him?
No, you keep that,
that's yours now.
My God.
This is not the first
time for you, after all.
Actually, it is.
What about your daughter?
I wasn't there.
I was working far away,
in Africa to be precise.
You were doing good?
I don't even remember.
The baby is coming!
It is a girl.
Before the baby leaves the
house for the first time,
it is our custom to have the
family offer a blessing.
- Leave?
- Yes.
- We are keeping our word to you.
- Word?
What word? I mean, I just
I brought Chinese, OK?
I've got a 100 fortune cookies.
It's OK. Everything
is as it should be.
Look, I didn't mean for you to have to
leave right after the child was born.
I mean, there's plenty
of room for everyone.
Maybe it's too much room.
My wife wants a smaller place
out of the city. No guests.
Just us and the children.
It is good as long
as we are together.
Sumia wants to call the baby Ethan.
- It's a boy's name.
- No.
It's the name of a great man who
didn't shoot us when he could.
And instead gave us his home.
She has chosen carefully.
The name is perfect.
Hey, how did it go?
Hugh asked me to go to the prom.
Good.
So dinner was a success.
Wow. You look nice.
Did you wear that for me today?
Uh... no. I had to...
I had to give a speech.
Are you coming to the
pre-party tomorrow?
Well, I am if you're asking.
It's on Hugh's father's rooftop.
You know Hugh comes from
a really cultured family.
Yeah.
Don't forget you've got Steelers
blood running through your veins.
They sent Hugh to a special school to learn
how to dance when he was like eight.
So?
So that means he's probably
a really good dancer.
So?
So I don't know how to
dance like that, Ethan.
- No.
- Come on.
- I'm not gonna dance.
- You can stand on my feet.
- I'm too big for this.
- You're not too big.
Now, stand on my feet.
I'm gonna teach you how to dance
to your mother's favorite song.
OK.
There and back.
- Pretty easy, huh?
- Not too bad.
Now get off.
Would you wear this
suit tomorrow for me?
Of course I would.
Mom.
Sweetie.
You haven't coughed.
Not since I've been back.
Remember when I'd bring Zooey
to school in the first grade?
She had that stuffed rabbit.
Lamby the lamb.
Right, Lamby the lamb.
I remember the day she never
took him to school again.
My stomach hurt that day.
That's how I feel now.
- Like you lost something.
- Yeah.
- Have you told her yet?
- No.
- You're gonna have to.
- I know.
Just tell her you love her.
She knows.
She needs to hear it from you.
Of course I love her. I mean,
I love her the same way...
the same way I love you.
Good morning.
Oh, God.
- You're not on the couch.
- No, Tina, I'm not on the couch.
Good morning, parents.
Wow, sweetheart.
What a good idea. Here.
Bring that orange juice right here.
Sweetie, just put down the tray,
I'll meet you in the kitchen. OK?
Come on, I squeezed the
oranges all by myself.
Now, please.
What's wrong, Mom?
You're acting really weird.
Nothing, sweetie. Just go finish getting
dressed and I'll take you to school.
Come on, let's go. Go.
Love you, Mom.
I love you, sweetie.
What's wrong with her seeing us?
Really.
What happens when you're gone?
Yeah?
The Albino is staying
at the Grand Hotel.
All right.
Hey. I'm not going anywhere.
- Hello.
- I'd have to be blind not to.
Your girls are expecting
you home tonight.
Who were you talking to?
Come on, accelerate!
Come on!
Come on, faster!
Have we lost him?
This kind of guy,
he'd never give up.
Why you don't kill me already?
Because you're the
father who knows best.
Just kill him!
Vivi...
Welcome back.
You let the Wolf slip
through your hands again.
Where am I?
A safe place.
We got your lab results
back today, Ethan.
I was actually pretty curious
myself. And as it turns out,
it looks like the treatment's
having a positive effect on you.
It's my wife. Hello?
Um...
I'm leaving the
doctor's office now.
Hurry up and get home. We're
gonna be late for Zooey's party.
OK.
I don't want to spend the rest
of my life killing for you, Vivi.
You're almost there, Ethan.
Kill the Wolf.
I'm gonna need a new suit.
You heard him.
There has been a change in plans.
We're leaving tonight.
Take me to my partner's house.
He will help me to
get out of Paris.
- Mom, don't ruin my night.
- Why don't you try them on?
No!
- Listen, just at least try them on?
- No!
Whoa!
Just smile and have fun.
Why? I hate these shoes.
I look like Little Miss Sunshine.
- You look great, honey.
- No, I don't.
- Zoe.
- Hugh.
- You look great.
- Really, I do?
Yeah, of course.
Oh, Mr. Renner, Mrs. Renner,
these are my parents.
Nice to see you again.
Thanks for inviting us.
You're welcome.
This is Ethan, Zooey's dad.
Hi. And this is my partner.
Pleasure to meet you.
And you.
If it wasn't for this party,
we might never have met.
How do you do?
Enchanté.
Wow.
Yeah, wow.
Kids.
Wow.
- May I take this? Thank you, sir.
- Yeah.
Isn't this great?
Yeah.
Zooey, do me a favor.
Try and use your best
judgment with Hugh tonight.
Cheers.
You're working again!
Yeah. There's a problem here.
That's why you came back to Paris?
No. I came back to
see you and Zooey.
It was all a lie.
You promised you'd keep
your work away from us.
- You're probably not even sick.
- It's not a lie, Tina.
Right now I don't have
the time to explain.
How many guys do we have?
The police will be
here in ten minutes.
- You all right?
- No.
No, I'm not so good.
I've gotta go...
If we go now, there is enough time.
OK. This party's over.
- You used us both!
- No, I would never do that.
I'll get my funds,
bring everyone in.
Make sure the street's blocked.
At least have the
decency to look at me.
Kill him.
It's just bad luck.
You're sick, Ethan.
Wow, this is unbelievable.
Yeah. I know. It's crazy.
I'm gonna be sick.
Come with me.
Did you scratch yourself?
No, please don't go.
Come home with me.
Just leave it to someone else.
Just please stay here.
- Zooey!
- What?
Get down!
You hear me in there?
I'm sending you down.
Oh, shit.
Wheel's turning.
No, stay, you fuckers!
Don't!
I gotta...
Don't.
I wouldn't mind killing you.
You scared a lot of
people up there.
This is my daughter's party.
Yes.
Yes, come on.
Viv.
Oh, my God.
Am I in hell?
So that's what it looks
like to you, Ethan.
Figures.
- Finish it.
- What?
You'll do what I tell you to.
- No.
- Finish it.
I passed my quota, Vivi.
Ethan...
Jesus Christ!
Are you really done
working for them?
A killer is a killer.
He'll never change.
I know I haven't done
right by you and Zooey.
Kill him.
- What about your daughter?
- I wasn't there.
Do it.
What kind of kid doesn't
know how to ride a bike?
The kind of kid who never
had a father to teach her.
- Ethan.
- Ethan!
Do it!
Promise you'll never
lie to me again.
You have no choice.
I don't think so.
The wife wants me to give it up.
No, she's down on the beach
right now throwing rocks.
- What?
- Yeah, we're...
We're taking a break from
each other right now.
At least she's not
throwing them at me.
Yeah, it's been all right.
There's been good and bad days.
She said things, I've said things.
but the week overall's
been really worth it.
Hey.
These are some presents
from me and, um...
a package that was
dropped at the house.
I can hear your car running.
Are you gonna go back?
I love you, Tina.
Just not enough to quit.
I think you're wrong,
but I understand.
If I could say one word to
you to change your mind,
would you give me that chance?
This isn't a game.
We don't have to stay in the same room,
we don't have to sleep together,
that's not what I'm asking.
If that becomes important,
you'll be the one to decide.
I'll hear the music,
and then I'll know.
And if I never hear it...
I've already gotten
more than I deserve.
I just wanna hang out as long as I
can with my daughter and my wife.
- What's the word?
- What?
What's the one word to
make me change my mind?
It's, uh... it's Christmas.
That's two, Ethan.
- Hey, Mom!
- Hi, sweetie.
I'm so glad you came!
Come on, let's go inside.
Dad's gonna make us hot cocoa.
Come on.
Is Dad a badass?
Well, he's, um... He's
done some things.
You think Dad's gonna stick around?
As long as he can, sweetheart.
He loves you so much.
Luis-subs Subtitling :D.
