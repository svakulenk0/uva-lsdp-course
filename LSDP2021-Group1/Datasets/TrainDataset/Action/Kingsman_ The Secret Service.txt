MAN :
This is Zero One Alpha.
We have secured Falcon.
I say again, we have
secured Falcon.
MAN 2 :
Grenade! Sir, get back!
Shit.
Fucking missed it.
How did I fucking miss it?
Merlin...
I apologize for putting you
in this position.
You trained him well.
James...
training is over.
Welcome to Kingsman...
Lancelot.
Sir.
I'll deal with this mess...
personally.
I very much regret
that your husband's bravery
I hope you understand.
WOMAN:
How can I understand?
He won't tell me anything.
I-I didn't even know he
wasn't with his squad.
I'm so sorry,
I can't say more.
But I would like to present you
with this Medal of Valor.
And if you look closely
on the back, there's a number.
And as a more concrete
gesture of our gratitude,
we'd like to offer you, um...
Let's call it a favor.
The nature of it is your choice.
Just tell the operator,
"Oxfords not brogues,"
and then I'll know it's you.
I don't want your help.
:
I want my husband back.
What's your name,
young man?
Eggsy.
Hello, Eggsy.
Can I see that?
You take care of this, Eggsy.
All right?
And take care of your mum, too.
¶ ¶
So sorry,
Professor Arnold.
Just a tiny bit more.
Oh, for God's sakes,
just rip it off.
I'm under very
strict instructions
not to hurt you.
Look, you've made a mistake.
I'm a university lecturer.
I've got no money.
This isn't about money.
Our boss just wants
to talk to you.
Am I meant
to find that reassuring?
He'll be here soon.
He'll explain.
Do you like whiskey?
Red, get the '62 Dalmore.
Mm.
Honestly,
this whiskey,
it's amazing.
You will shit.
¶ ¶
I suppose asking to borrow a cup
of sugar is a step too far.
Professor Arnold...
I'm here to take you home.
Hmm.
It'd be a sin
to spill any.
Don't you think?
¶ ¶
Can you hold these? Please?
Thank you.
Everything is clean.
My kind of welcome.
Mmm!
:
No stomach for violence.
I mean, literally.
I see one drop of blood,
that is me done.
I'm like...
projectile.
Listen, I'm so sorry
you had to witness all
this unpleasantness,
due to our uninvited guest.
But I promise you, by
the time I've found out
who he works for,
you and I will be
the best of friends.
To the shop, please.
Arthur's in
the dining room, sir.
Arthur.
Galahad.
The others were
beginning to wonder
if we were going to have
a double toast.
ARTHUR:
Gentlemen, I'm thankful to say
it's been 17 years
since we last
had occasion to use
this decanter.
Lancelot...
was an outstanding agent
and a true Kingsman.
He will be sorely missed.
To Lancelot.
OTHERS:
To Lancelot.
ARTHUR:
I intend to start
the selection process
for Lancelot's replacement
tomorrow.
I want each of you
to propose a candidate
and have them report to UKHQ
no later than 9:00 p.m. GMT.
Thank you.
ARTHUR:
Merlin.
Come in.
Lancelot was investigating
a group of mercenaries
who were experimenting
with biological weaponry.
Glasses, gentlemen, please.
Uganda, 2012.
Synthetic cathinones.
They put it in
the water supply
of a guerilla
army base... rage,
cannibalism,
multiple fatalities.
Chechnya, 2013.
Insurgents turned
on one another.
Indisputably, the work
of our mercenaries,
but no trace
of any chemicals of any kind.
So what happened to Lancelot?
He tracked them
to this property
in Argentina.
While he had them
under surveillance,
he became aware
they'd effected a kidnapping.
So he executed a solo
rescue mission,
which failed.
This is his last transmission.
Who is he?
Some climate-change
doomsayer,
expounds something
called Gaia theory
about the world healing itself
or some such.
But what's curious is
he's not actually missing.
This is Professor Arnold...
at Imperial College
this morning.
ARTHUR:
It's all yours.
And don't forget your
membership proposal.
Try picking
a more suitable
candidate this time.
with the times remains
an entirely
foreign concept to you.
Need I remind you
I wouldn't be here
if it weren't
for that young man?
He was as much Kingsman material
as any of them. More so.
But he wasn't exactly
one of us, was he?
Let's face it, Galahad,
your little experiment failed.
With respect, Arthur,
you're a snob.
With respect?
The world is changing.
There's a reason why aristocrats
developed weak chins.
WOMAN:
Eggsy?
Eggsy, come here.
REPORTER:
...impact of global warming...
WOMAN: Got any Rizla, babe?
No.
Why don't you do
your mum a favor,
go down to the shop
and get some?
Get them yourself.
Oi.
What have I said to you about
speaking to Dean like that?
EGGSY:
Three's a crowd, isn't it?
Why don't Dean's poodle go?
I'll tell you what.
Why don't you take this,
go and get some Rizlas,
get yourself some sweets...
and while you're gone,
we'll show your mother
how three can be good company.
MOTHER:
Thanks, babe.
Come here.
There we go.
Is that better?
MAN:
Low self-esteem,
that's her problem.
Fuck off. Why would she
have low self-esteem?
Eggsy's mum is well fit.
No offense, bruv.
It's all right.
One of these days,
I'm gonna smash his face in.
Are you mental, cuz?
He'd just get that lot
to do you and then pretend
he knew nothing...
...about it.
MAN:
Oi!
You think you can chat shit
about us
and we won't do nothing
just 'cause our guvnor's
banging Eggsy's mum?
Pretty much, yeah.
Bruv, just leave it.
Let's just go, man.
It's not worth it.
You boys
have outstayed your welcome.
Leave.
What?
I'm sorry about that, bruv.
Yeah.
Mug.
They weren't fucking
worth it, boys.
It's freezing.
Why are we walking?
You jacked
his fucking car keys, bruv?
Yeah.
Now we're gonna nick his car.
Fucking...
Shit.
Move, bruv!
Hold on, boys.
Hey, that's my fucking car!
Hey! Hey!
Eggsy, I swear,
you want to fucking stop it!
You're a fucking dead man!
Stop it!
I'm gonna fuckin' have ya!
Come on.
Floor it, Eggsy!
Floor it!
Wanker!
Yeah, yeah, Dean, look, it's me.
Eggsy just stole
my fucking car, yeah.
Yeah, I've come out the pub,
he's done about 15 doughnuts
in my fucking face,
and he's drove off.
No, I can't have it!
He's disrespecting me,
and that means
he's disrespecting you.
Oh, hold up! What the...
Come on, Eggsy!
Dickhead.
Foxes are vermin, cuz.
Should've driven it over.
Should've done a lot of things.
I'll sort this.
Get out of the car.
I said,
get out of the fucking car!
POLICEMAN :
Now, you can start giving me
some names
of the boys you were with,
or you go down.
It's up to you.
I want to exercise my right
to a phone call.
Well...
I hope it's to your mum,
to tell her you're gonna be
¶ ¶
RECEPTIONIST:
Customer Complaints,
how may I help you?
Um... my name's Eggsy Unwin.
Sorry, Gary Unwin.
And I'm up shit creek.
I'm in Holborn police station,
and my mum said
to call this number
if ever I needed help and...
I'm sorry, sir. Wrong number.
Wait! Wait!
Oxfords not brogues?
Your complaint has been
duly noted,
and we hope that we have not
lost you as a loyal customer.
Yeah.
You what?
I...
Yeah.
Yes, I totally understand.
¶ ¶
Eggsy.
Would you like a lift home?
Who are you?
The man who got you released.
That ain't an answer.
A little gratitude
would be nice.
My name is Harry Hart,
and I gave you that medal.
Your father saved my life.
EGGSY:
Like an officer?
Not quite.
So where was you posted,
Iraq or something?
Sorry, Eggsy, classified.
But my dad saved
your life, yeah?
The day your father died,
I missed something.
And if it weren't
for his courage,
my mistake would have cost
the lives of every man present.
So I owe him.
Your father was a brave man.
A good man.
And having read your files,
I think he'd be
bitterly disappointed
in the choices you've made.
You can't talk
to me like that.
Huge IQ, great performance
at primary school...
and it all went tits up.
Drugs, petty crime,
never had a job.
Oh, you think there's a lot of
jobs going around here, do you?
Doesn't explain why
you gave up your hobbies.
First prize,
regional Under-10s gymnastics
two years in a row.
Your coach had you pegged
as Olympic team material.
Yeah, well, when you grow up
around someone like my stepdad,
you pick up new hobbies
pretty quick.
Of course.
Always someone else's fault.
Who's to blame
for you quitting the Marines?
You were halfway
through training,
doing brilliantly,
but you gave up.
Because my mum went mental.
Banging on about losing me
as well as my dad.
Didn't want me being cannon
fodder for snobs like you!
Judging people like me
from your ivory towers
with no thought about
why we do what we do.
We ain't got much choice.
You get me?
And if we was born with the same
silver spoon up our arses,
we'd do just as well as you.
If not better.
YOUNG MAN: What the fuck
you doing here?
You taking the piss?
Some more examples of young men
who simply need
a silver suppository?
No, they're exceptions. Come on.
Nonsense.
We haven't finished our drinks.
After you nicked his car,
Dean says you're fair game.
He don't give a shit
what your mum says.
HARRY:
Um, listen, boys.
I've had
a rather emotional day,
so whatever your beef
with Eggsy is,
and I'm sure it's well-founded,
I'd appreciate it enormously
if you could just leave us
in peace
until I finish this lovely pint
of Guinness.
You should
get out of the way, Granddad,
or you'll get hurt and all.
He ain't joking.
You should go.
:
Hmm...
Excuse me. Excuse me.
If you're looking
for another rent boy,
they're on the corner
of Smith Street.
Manners...
...maketh...
...man.
Do you know what that means?
Then let me teach you a lesson.
Are we going to stand
around here all day,
or are we going to fight?
You fucking dirty,
fucking dirty...!
Sorry about that.
Needed to let off
a little steam.
I heard yesterday
a friend of mine died.
He knew your father,
too, actually.
Now, I do apologize, Eggsy.
I shouldn't have done this
in front of you.
No, please, I won't
say nothing.
I swear...
If there's one thing I can do,
it's keep my mouth shut.
You won't tell a soul?
Ask the Feds.
I've never grassed anyone up.
Is that a promise?
On my life!
Much appreciated, Eggsy.
You're right about the snobs.
But there, too,
there are exceptions.
Best of luck with everything.
ANCHOR: In celebrity news,
the Richmond Valentine movie
premiered in Hollywood
last night.
The story of the Internet
billionaire's rise to power
is expected to be
this award season's hot ticket.
One notable absence
from the red carpet
was Iggy Azalea,
still missing three days
after she failed to appear
at her Oakland concert.
No ransom has been demanded.
Eggsy, just go, please,
because he's gonna...
No, please, don't hurt him!
Fuck off!
Don't hurt him!
Get the fuck away with you!
Shut the fuck up!
Who was with you
in that fucking pub?
I want to know the name
of the geezer you was with!
I wasn't with no one!
Who was it?
I don't know what
you're on about.
Who was it?
I don't know who
you're fucking on about!
Fucking tell me his name!
I don't know
who you're fucking on about!
DEAN:
You listen to me!
I want to know
who you was with in that pub.
Do you understand?
I want to know his fucking name!
Because, I swear,
I'll rip your head off.
Tell me!
I don't know what you're fucking
on about!
DEAN:
Tell me!
Just tell him, Eggsy!
Fuck off!
Fuck off, Michelle!
I could kill you right now,
and no one in the whole world
will notice!
HARRY :
But I would.
I have enough evidence
on your activities
to have you locked up
for the rest of your life,
Mr. Dean Anthony Baker.
What the fuck?!
So I suggest
you leave the boy alone,
or I shall be forced
to deliver it
to the appropriate authorities.
Eggsy,
meet me at the tailor
I told you about.
What the fuck's going on here?
Eggsy, you fucking maggot!
Hey, we got a racer!
Come here.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Eggsy, you fucking...
Come here, son!
You wanker!
I'll have you, son!
¶ ¶
I've never met
a tailor before,
but I know you ain't one.
Come with me.
Come on in.
What do you see?
Someone who wants to know
what the fuck is going on.
I see a young man
with potential.
A young man who is loyal,
who can do as he's asked,
and who wants to do
something good with his life.
Did you see the film
No.
How about
All right.
My point is, that the lack
of a silver spoon
has set you on a certain path,
but you needn't stay on it.
If you're prepared
to adapt and learn,
you can transform.
Oh, like in
Well, you're full of surprises.
Yes, like
Only, in this case,
I'm offering you the opportunity
to become a Kingsman.
A tailor?
A Kingsman agent.
Like a spy?
Of sorts.
Interested?
You think I've got
anything to lose?
Since 1849,
Kingsman tailors have clothed
the world's most
powerful individuals.
By 1919,
a great number of them
had lost their heirs
to World War I.
That meant a lot of money
going uninherited,
and a lot of powerful men
with a desire to preserve peace
and protect life.
Our founders realized
that they could channel
that wealth and influence
for the greater good.
And so began our other venture.
An independent, international
intelligence agency
operating at the highest
level of discretion.
Above the politics
and bureaucracy
that undermine the integrity
of government-run
spy organizations.
The suit is a modern
gentleman's armor,
and the Kingsman agents
are the new knights.
EGGSY: How deep does
this fucking thing go?
HARRY:
Deep enough.
¶ ¶
¶ ¶
Shit, we're late.
¶ ¶
Your father had
the same look on his face.
As did I.
Come on.
Galahad.
My code name.
Late again, sir.
Good luck.
In you go.
MERLIN:
Fall in.
Ladies and gentlemen,
my name is Merlin.
You are about to embark
on what is probably
the most dangerous
job interview in the world.
One of you,
and only one of you,
will become the next Lancelot.
Can anybody tell me
what this is?
Yes?
Body bag, sir.
Correct.
Charlie, isn't it?
Yes, sir.
Good.
In a moment, you will each
collect a body bag.
You will write your name
on that bag.
You will write the details of
your next of kin on that bag.
This represents
your acknowledgment of the risks
that you're about to face
as well as your agreement
to strict confidentiality.
Which, incidentally,
if you break,
will result in you
and your next of kin being
in that bag.
Is that understood?
Excellent.
Fall out.
Roxanne.
But call me Roxy.
I'm Eggsy.
"Eggy"?
No, "Eggsy."
Eggy?
And where did they dig you up?
You know we're not allowed
to discuss
who proposed us.
No need to bite his head off.
Charlie's only making
conversation, right, Charlie?
Hm.
I'm Digby.
Digby.
Eggy, this is Rufus.
Rufus, Eggy.
So, Eggy, are you
Oxford or Cambridge?
Neither.
Saint Andrews?
Durham?
No, wait, I think
we may have met.
Did you serve me
at the McDonald's
in Winchester service station?
No, but if I had,
I'd have given you an extra
helping of secret sauce.
It's definitely Saint Andrews.
Just ignore them.
You need a pen?
Cheers.
Amelia, isn't it?
Amelia, Eggsy.
Hi, Eggsy.
Don't take any notice
of those guys.
ROXY:
That's what I told him.
It's just scare tactics.
Classic Army technique.
No one's gonna die.
Shame.
VALENTINE:
Great.
You don't know,
the CIA don't know.
Nobody knows who this guy is?
Fine.
Seriously, it's fine.
Well, it's not really fine,
but it's not why I'm here.
Hell, man, you know me.
Money's not my issue.
I could've retired
straight out of MIT,
fucked off to some island,
let the business run itself.
Nobody told me to try
and save the planet.
I wanted to.
Climate change research,
lobbying,
years of study,
billions of dollars,
and you know why I quit?
Because the last time I checked,
the planet was still fucked.
Hence, my epiphany.
Money won't solve this.
Those idiots
who call themselves politicians
have buried their heads
in the sand
and stood for nothing
but reelection.
So I spent the last two years
trying to find a real solution.
And I found it.
Now, if you really want to make
the world a better place,
I suggest you open
your fucking ears,
because I'm about
to tell it to you.
PRESIDENT:
Go on, Mr. Valentine.
I'm still listening.
VALENTINE:
As long as you agree
to all my terms.
¶ ¶
What the fuck's going on?
The fuck is this?
What's going on?
Oh, shit.
Jesus!
CHARLIE:
All right, no one panic.
Listen to me.
Stay calm.
Fuck.
Loo snorkels, loo snorkels!
Loo snorkels?
Showerheads!
Showerheads?!
She's right.
Go! Fucking go!
Hey, hang about, what's wrong
with the fucking door?
¶ ¶
Congratulations
on completing your first task.
Charlie, Roxy, well done.
For those of you
who are still confused,
if you can get a breathing tube
around a U-bend of a toilet,
you have an unlimited
air supply.
Simple physics,
worth remembering.
Eggsy, well done for spotting
that was a two-way mirror.
He's probably seen
enough of them.
Yeah, you can all wipe
those smirks off your faces.
Because as far as I'm concerned,
every single one of you
has failed.
You all forgot the most
important thing...
Teamwork.
So much for classic
Army technique.
Thirty-five.
One-oh-five.
That's it. That's it.
Hello.
Can I help you?
Yes. I have a question
about anthropogenic force.
:
Oh... Really?
Well, it's actually
quite fascinating.
My colleague died
trying to rescue you,
and I'm sure you saw
how well trained he was,
so I suggest you tell me
who kidnapped you
and why they let you go.
I have no idea
what you're talking...
I'm not supposed to say it,
but it was...
Oh, for God's sake,
I've barely touched you.
Oh, man up!
VALENTINE: Fuck that guy,
whoever he is. I'm gonna...
He made me kill
Professor Arnold.
I goddamn loved
Professor Arnold.
Well, the good news is
we know the emergency
and surveillance system work.
You know what's not good news?
:
"My colleague died!"
That's what he said!
This is an organization,
and they're all over us.
Whoever you spoke to...
I told you, I made contact
with the KGB, MI6,
Mossad and Beijing.
They all insist
he wasn't one of theirs.
Beijing.
So freaky how there's
no recognizable name
for the Chinese secret service.
Now, that's what you
call a secret, right?
You know what?
Fuck it.
We need to speed things up.
Bring the product
release forward.
We're only halfway
into production,
and speeding it
will cost a fortune.
I look like I give a fuck?
Just get it done.
As some of you
will have learned last night,
teamwork is paramount
here at Kingsman.
We're here to enhance your
skills, test you to the limit.
Which is why
you're gonna pick a puppy.
Wherever you go, your dog goes.
You will care for it,
you will teach it,
and by the time it's fully
trained, so will you be.
Those of you who are
still here, that is.
Do you understand?
Choose your puppy.
EGGSY:
A poodle?
ROXY:
What?
They're gun dogs.
Oldest working breed.
Easy to train.
A pug?
It's a bulldog, innit?
It'll get bigger though,
won't it?
Shit.
His MRI shows
no signs of concussion.
No direct
brain trauma at all.
How much longer
can he be out?
That's the million-dollar
question.
We don't know what he was
exposed to in there.
What about Harry's footage?
It didn't stream to
his home terminal.
Encrypted and uncrackable.
If and when he comes around,
you might want to have a word
with him about
sharing his password.
Is he gonna be all right?
We need to have patience, Eggsy.
But there's hope, okay?
If I were you, I'd concentrate
on your training.
Make it through the tests.
Make him proud.
Fuck!
Come on, come on, come on!
J.B., come on!
Come on!
I'm not coming last
'cause of you.
J.B., I'll shoot you!
Goddamn you,
I'll fucking shoot you!
Merlin said
we're not allowed to hold you.
Bollocks.
¶ ¶
Water!
Come on, then!
Eggsy, forget it!
Oh, what's wrong, mate?
You can't take a joke?
Seriously, you'll get thrown
out, and it's just not worth it.
Maybe I don't give a fuck
if I get kicked out!
Do it.
Come on, you pleb.
Charlie, fuck off!
Aw...
Yeah, go on, walk away.
Dickhead.
Come on, J.B.
Come on, good boy.
MERLIN:
starting now.
CHARLIE:
You know, it's unbelievable.
You're still here,
lingering like
some big steaming shit
that just won't flush.
Roger that.
Target identified.
And how about
you shut the fuck up?
Positive discrimination,
that's what it is.
It's like those fucking state
school kids who get into Oxford
on "C" grades 'cause their mum
is a one-legged lesbian.
You don't know fuck all
about my grades.
Oh, forgive me, I'm sure
you're highly educated.
Fire when ready.
EGGSY: How's that
for positive discrimination?
I want to thank you both
for listening,
and I really, really appreciate
you traveling all this way,
Your Royal Highness.
And you, too,
Prime Minister.
I think this is quite brilliant.
It's absolutely brilliant.
You are completely crazy.
Don't touch...
Sorry, Your Royal Highness.
But you've got
a big role to play
in getting the Scandinavian
region back on track.
You're popular,
inspirational,
and you have the power
to galvanize the people.
Now, whether
you're on board or not,
I'm going to have to insist
on getting you somewhere
I can ensure your safety.
How about you, Prime Minister?
You in or out?
Well, I think it's about time
that a politician did something
that, uh...
actually made a difference.
Too true.
What...?
Take her away.
Drink?
Why not?
Don't worry. No harm
will come to the princess.
Well, I'm a republican anyway,
so it...
it really doesn't matter.
Release the princess!
Okay, you're done.
Not so bad, right?
Hardly felt a thing.
Welcome aboard.
Pleasure is all mine.
Ever heard of knocking?
Only when I'm casing
a place to rob.
Merlin said
you wanted to see me.
I hope J.B.'s training
is going as well as yours is.
Sit.
Congratulations on making it
to the final six candidates.
Your test results were even
better than I could've hoped.
Come in.
Oh...
Eggsy, I need to have
a private conversation.
You're dismissed.
Nonsense.
Let him observe.
Might learn a thing or two.
As you wish.
Take a look at this.
HARRY:
Oh, for God's sake, I've barely
touched you. Oh, man up!
Fucking hell!
That is rank, Harry.
You blew up his head?
It's a bit much, innit?
Actually, the explosion
was caused
by an implant in his neck.
Here, under the scar.
HARRY: Did my hardware pick up
the signal that triggered it?
Fortunately, yes.
Unfortunately, the IP address
I traced it to is registered
to the Valentine Corporation.
HARRY:
That's not much of a lead.
He has millions
of employees worldwide.
EGGSY: That Richmond
Valentine is a genius.
Did you not see
his announcement today?
No.
We each spend on average
$2,000 a year
on cell phone
and Internet usage.
It gives me great pleasure
to announce
those days are over.
As of tomorrow,
every man, woman and child
can claim a free SIM card,
compatible with any cell phone,
any computer,
and utilize my communications
network for free.
Free calls, free Internet
for everyone.
Forever.
HARRY: Valentine's assistant
has the same implant scar.
I think Mr. Valentine and I
should have a tête-à-tête.
He's having a gala dinner
next week.
I'll get you an invitation.
You need to be careful, though.
Since you've been out, hundreds
of VIPs have gone missing.
No ransom notes,
exactly like Professor Arnold.
Then I suggest you make my alias
somebody worth kidnapping.
Fuck, fuck.
Fuck, fuck, fuck.
What, don't like heights?
Yeah, it's okay.
I've done it before,
which is probably why,
come to think of it.
Hey, it's gonna be all right.
You're top of the class.
MERLIN :
Listen up.
Your mission is to land
in the target
without the radar detecting you.
If I read you on the radar
or you miss the target,
you go home.
Is that understood?
Drop zone coming up,
We got to go.
Eggsy, I really don't
think I can do this.
Of course you can't.
Head to the back
and I'll show you how, yeah?
Come on!
Eggsy! Eggsy, wait!
Hang on!
Roxy, just stop fucking about!
Follow me, yeah?
Come on!
:
Roxy, it's now or never.
Jump!
EGGSY: Good girl, Rox,
I'm glad you made it!
Yes!
Yeah!
Please!
Yeah!
Come on!
MERLIN:
My, my, you're all
very cheerful.
Did you really think it was
gonna be that straightforward?
Any idiot can read
a heads-up display.
A Kingsman agent
needs to be able
to solve problems
under pressure.
Like what to do when one of
your group has no parachute.
ROXY: What? No parachute?!
EGGSY: Shit!
Who?!
Fuck!
Which one?
RUFUS:
What do we do?!
MERLIN:
I told you. Aim for the target.
Come in under the radar.
And I hope not to be
scraping one of you up.
But if I do have to,
and you're inside the target,
please know I'll be
very impressed.
RUFUS: Fuck!
ROXY: Oh, shit!
Everybody listen,
I've got a plan!
Pair off!
Grab the closest person to them.
Rufus, come on!
Oh, fuck!
EGGSY:
Rufus!
Oh, shit! I can't!
Fuck!
Oh, thank God.
EGGSY:
Rufus, you wanker!
Shit, we're an odd number now!
Quick, make a circle!
CHARLIE: Fuck, he's right!
Boys, let's do it.
We pull our cords one by one!
When we know who's fucked,
the person on their right
grabs them.
ROXY:
Okay, Eggsy.
MERLIN:
Good plan, Eggsy.
You have 30 seconds.
Come on now, hurry.
Me first!
Oh, fuck!
:
Yes!
Okay, me next.
See you on the ground, boys.
Now me.
Fuck!
Roxy, no matter what happens
now, I've got you, all right?
Okay, Eggsy.
Yours first, okay?
Yep.
Oh, shit!
Shit!
Shit!
Rox!
Fuck.
Hugo, Digby.
You don't land in the K,
you're not in the K.
Rufus, you opened too soon.
You were all over the radar.
All three of you,
pack your bags, go home.
Eggsy, Roxy, congratulations.
You set a new record.
Opening at 300 feet,
that's pretty ballsy.
Well done for completing
another task.
Fall out.
Sorry, sir.
But why the fuck did you
choose me as the gimp?
Am I the expendable candidate?
No, no, no.
You don't talk to me like that.
You have a complaint,
you come here
and you whisper it in my ear.
You need to take that chip
off your shoulder.
¶ ¶
Mr. DeVere.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
I'm awfully sorry.
I seem to have my
dates muddled up.
Oh, no, no, no.
I canceled the gala
because of you.
Anybody willing to donate that
much deserves their own dinner.
Come in.
Thank you.
Gotta admit, I was really
intrigued to meet you.
There aren't many billionaires
I don't know.
I don't doubt it.
And, obviously, I had my people
look into your affairs,
and that's some
pretty old money you're from.
How'd your folks make it?
Property, mostly.
Property and the markets.
Nothing questionable,
if that's your concern.
Ah, look, I'm just into finding
out what caliber person you are.
I'm sure you understand that.
I most certainly do.
Hope you're hungry.
I'm famished.
Good.
VALENTINE:
Grab a seat.
¶ ¶
I'll have the Big Mac, please.
Great choice!
But nothing beats
two cheeseburgers
with secret sauce.
Goes great
with this '45 Lafite.
A classic pairing.
And may I suggest Twinkies and
a 1937 Château d'Yquem
for pudding?
I like it.
So...
you want to donate
to my foundation.
You are aware that
I wound things down
in that area, right?
Climate change is a threat
which affects us all,
Mr. Valentine.
And you're one of
the few powerful men
who seems to share my concerns.
No, I shut things down because
I wasn't getting anywhere.
Every bit of research kept
pointing to the same thing.
That carbon emissions
are a red herring
and that we're past
the point of no return,
no matter what
remedial actions we take.
Oh, you know your shit.
I sometimes envy
the blissful ignorance
of those less well-versed
in the... shit.
As Professor Arnold always said,
"Humankind is the only virus
"cursed to live with the
horrifying knowledge
of its host's
fragile mortality."
You know, not a lot of
people knew about him.
You like spy movies,
Mr. DeVere?
¶ ¶
Nowadays they're all a
little serious for my taste.
But the old ones...
marvelous.
Give me a far-fetched
theatrical plot any day.
The old Bond movies!
: Oh, man!
Oh, when I was a kid,
that was my dream job:
gentleman spy.
I always felt
the old Bond films
were only as good
as the villain.
As a child,
I rather fancied a future
as a colorful megalomaniac.
What a shame
we both had to grow up.
Bon appétit.
Just give me a couple of days
to think over your proposal.
I'll have my people
get in touch with yours,
and it's all good.
And thank you for
such a... happy meal.
Well, want me to follow him?
Nah. I put a nano tracker
gel in the wine.
We'll know his every move
for the next 24 hours.
Finally find out
who he works for.
Valentine didn't let me
out of his sight.
All I got was this
on the way in.
South Glade Mission Church
is a hate group
based in Kentucky.
FBI have been
monitoring them for years.
But you think Valentine
is a supporter?
No evidence yet
of a direct connection,
but I'll keep looking.
Oh, by the way,
our ever-growing list
of missing persons now includes
Scandinavian royalty.
Royal Crown Princess Tilde.
TILDE:
Just let me out...
you psycho!
I told you,
you're free to go
any time you want, as long
as you agree to my conditions.
I don't agree,
and I am never, ever
going to agree!
Tough shit.
Bitch.
MAN :
Let me out! ...open up.
I want to speak
to the British consul!
NEWSWOMAN:
has continued to grow
in recent weeks,
and world leaders are coming
under increasing pressure
We are doing
everything in our power
to find Princess Tilde.
You know, governments
and security forces worldwide
are working together to find the
person behind these abductions.
NEWSWOMAN:
continue to wait in line
day and night
Uh, Mrs. P.
You get one?
Yeah... yeah,
I been queuing up all day.
NEWSWOMAN:
Richmond Valentine
has already seen
over a billion cards
distributed.
MERLIN:
At ease.
So you thought
we were done for the day, huh?
Well, we're not.
A party?
Tonight, in London.
Who's this?
Your target.
Your mission
is to use your NLP training
to win over the individual
in the photograph
in your envelope.
And when I say "win over,"
I do mean in the biblical sense.
Easy.
Posh girls love
a bit of rough.
We'll see
about that, yeah?
We certainly will.
Hi. Sorry, I just had
to come over and say,
amazing eyes.
Are you wearing color contacts?
No!
CHARLIE: You so are.
ROXY: Oh, my God, negging!
That's hilarious.
I haven't heard anyone
try that since the noughties.
Excuse me?
Negging.
Saying something negative
to a pretty girl in order to
undermine her social value.
It's supposed to make you
want to win his approval.
Absurdly basic,
neuro-linguistic
programming technique.
Is it just me, or does
this champagne taste
a little bit funny?
It's an acquired taste, mate.
I think
it's just cheap.
Get one of these instead.
They're delicious.
You know, if you're
into seduction techniques,
this guy is textbook.
See what he just did?
It's called an opinion opener.
He got you talking
with a neutral question,
got all of us
involved in the conversation,
so that you
craved individual attention.
No, I'm just saying
the champagne tastes rank.
Lady Sophie Montague-Herring,
phone call for you
at reception.
Be right back.
We'll see you in a bit, yeah?
ROXY: See you in a bit.
Budge up, Rox.
I'm feeling a bit rough.
Are you all right?
No.
MAN:
Sorry to eavesdrop, but,
you know, there's
a much easier way to guarantee
getting someone home.
Rohypnol.
Or even something stronger.
:
Who the fuck are you?
Where am I?
This knife...
can save your life, eh?
Fuck!
My employer's got
two questions for you, Eggsy:
What the fuck is Kingsman,
and who's Harry Hart?
I don't know
who the fuck that is!
Shit!
Oh, Eggsy, I just killed
two of your friends for giving
me the same bullshit answer!
Fuck!
Just cut
the fucking ropes, please!
MAN:
Hey, Eggsy!
Is Kingsman worth dying for?
:
F...
Fuck you...!
Congratulations.
Bloody well done.
How'd the others do?
Roxy passed with flying colors.
Charlie's up next.
Want to watch?
Yeah, all right.
Oh, fuck.
Is Kingsman
really worth dying for?
No, it fucking isn't!
Shit, I'll tell you
what you want. Please!
:
Chester King is Arthur.
Arthur's head of a spy agency...
It's called Kingsman.
Get me out of here!
Thank you, Charlie.
Much appreciated.
Come on!
That wasn't the fucking deal!
:
Fuck...!
Oh, fuck!
I had such
high hopes for you.
You're a bloody disgrace.
Arthur, I'm sorry.
At least untie me.
Untie yourself.
Arthur... Arthur, please.
CHARLIE: I'm the fucking son
of the... shit!
:
Anyone? Hello?
Galahad, Percival,
congratulations.
Your candidates
have reached the final stage
of the testing process.
As tradition allows,
you now have 24 hours
to spend with them.
Eggsy...
you should know your
father reached this point.
From now on,
there are no safety nets,
understood?
Good. Dismissed.
:
Charlie,
time to go home.
CHARLIE:
Fuck you!
Fucking Dad's
gonna hear about this!
EGGSY :
or not to pee?"
That was the headline
the day after
I defused a dirty bomb
in Paris.
EGGSY: "Germany - 1,
England - 5."
Missed that game.
I was breaking up
an undercover spy ring
at the Pentagon.
My first mission.
Foiled the assassination
of Margaret Thatcher.
Not everybody'd thank you
for that one.
The point is, Eggsy,
nobody thanked me
for any of them.
Front page news
on all these occasions
was celebrity nonsense.
Because it's the
nature of Kingsman
that our achievements
remain secret.
A gentleman's name should
appear in the newspaper
only three times:
when he's born,
when he marries,
and when he dies.
And we are,
first and foremost, gentlemen.
That's me fucked, then.
Well, it's like
Charlie said...
I'm just a pleb.
Nonsense.
Being a gentleman
has nothing to do with the
circumstances of one's birth.
Being a gentleman
is something one learns.
Yeah, but how?
All right, first lesson.
You should have asked me
before you
took a seat.
Second lesson.
How to make a proper martini.
Yes, Harry.
Goddamn it!
This fucking hurts!
You're the one who asked
for a biometric security system.
What's wrong
with a simple switch?
A simple switch?!
This is an extremely
dangerous machine.
It should only be
operated by someone
as responsible
and sane as me.
Bad shit can happen if this
falls into the wrong hands.
Whoa!
We done here? Shit!
No. Now this one.
For the test at the church.
This one just has
a short range.
A simple switch will do.
So are you gonna teach me
how to talk proper,
like in
Don't be absurd.
Being a gentleman has nothing
to do with one's accent.
It's about being at ease
in one's own skin.
As Hemingway said,
"There is nothing noble
"in being superior
to your fellow man.
True nobility is being superior
to your former self."
the first thing every gentleman
needs is a good suit.
By which I mean,
a bespoke suit.
Never off the peg.
And Kingsman suits
are always bulletproof.
So let's get you measured,
and then, whether
you get the job
or not, you'll have
a lasting and...
useful memento
of your time at Kingsman.
I'm so sorry, sir,
but a gentleman is
completing his fitting.
Fitting room two is available.
One does
not use fitting room two
when one is popping
one's cherry.
Perhaps I'll show you
fitting room three
while we wait.
So we going up or down?
Neither.
This it?
Of course not.
Pull the hook on your left.
Ah, yes.
Very, very nice.
Now, you're going to
need a pair of shoes
to go with your suit.
An Oxford is any formal shoe
with open lacing.
This additional decorative piece
is called broguing.
"Oxfords, not brogues."
Words to live by, Eggsy.
Words to live by.
Try a pair.
Your weapon scores are
excellent, by the way.
These you're familiar with.
And this is
our standard-issue pistol.
It's quite unique.
As you'll see, it also
fires a shotgun cartridge
for use in messy
close-range situations.
How do they feel?
Yeah, good.
Now do your very
best impersonation
of a German aristocrat's
formal greeting.
No, Eggsy.
That is sick.
In the old days,
they had a phone
in the heel, as well.
How do I get it back in?
Well, it's coated in one of
the fastest-acting neurotoxins
known to man, so...
very carefully.
Now, I've had
a lot of fun with this.
One of our finest examples
of chemical engineering.
A poison...
Harmless when ingested,
but at a time
convenient to you,
can be... remotely activated.
Primed.
Lethal.
And what about these?
What do these do?
Electrocute you?
Don't be ridiculous.
It's a hand grenade.
Shut up.
You want to electrocute someone,
you'll need a signet ring.
A gentleman traditionally wears
the signet on his left hand,
but a Kingsman wears it
on whichever hand
happens to be dominant.
Touch the contact
behind the ring,
it delivers 50,000 volts.
And what about them?
What makes them so special?
Nothing.
That technology's caught up
with the spy world.
Put it back, Eggsy.
TAILOR:
Gentleman's just finished.
Mr. DeVere!
What a coincidence!
You are totally
the reason I am here.
When you left my house,
I was thirsting
for that dope-ass
smoking jacket you had on,
and since I'm going
to Royal Ascot,
and apparently you need one
of these penguin suits...
here I am.
What are you doing here?
What's up, man?
Richmond Valentine.
This is my new valet.
I was just introducing him
to my tailor.
Another coincidence.
So am I.
Have you had any chance to
think further on my proposal?
Most definitely.
My people will be getting
in touch with you very soon.
I guarantee it.
A word of advice:
Ascot requires top hat.
I might suggest Lock & Co.
Hatters.
St. James's.
"Lox," as in smoked fish?
As in "locked up."
Oh.
I have trouble understanding
you people sometimes.
You all talk so funny.
Gentlemen, would you
look after him, please?
Now, this...
is a dope-ass top hat.
Gazelle!
Let's go ascoting.
VALENTINE :
Your hat looks fine, Gazelle.
Come on, don't make me late
for the queen.
Come on, Gazelle,
we're gonna be late.
How far is Ascot?
How far?
Merlin said you wanted
to see me, sir?
Sit down.
Pretty dog.
What's his name?
J.B.
As in James Bond?
No.
Jason Bourne?
No. Jack Bauer.
Oh!
Bravo.
It pains me
to admit it, Eggsy,
but I think that one day
you might be as good a spy
as any of them.
Take it.
Shoot the dog.
¶ ¶
This weapon is live.
Shoot the dog.
Give me the gun.
At least the girl's got balls.
Get out.
I knew you couldn't make it.
Go home.
Merlin,
send in Roxy, please.
Welcome...
to Kingsman...
Lancelot.
¶ ¶
Mom?
Eggsy!
Oh, God, where have you been?
I've been so worried about you.
Oh, my days,
look how big you've grown.
Where is he?
I'm fine.
Eggsy, please, please,
just don't get involved.
Ma, I should never
have left you on your own.
This stops right now.
I'll be right back.
Eggsy...
Oi! Dean!
Oh, Mugsy.
So you're back.
What, you gone
and nicked a fucking taxi now?
Yeah. Can I have a word
about my mum's black eye?
You want to have a word with me?
You get out of that cab,
I'll knock you straight
back down on your fucking arse.
Tell your muppets to go inside,
then I'll get out.
Go on, lads.
There'll be two hits:
me hitting him;
him hitting the floor.
Come on, then,
you prick, let's see
what you got, eh?
Want a bit of me?
What are you doing?
What the fuck?
Get out of the fucking car!
No, no! Come on!
What are you doing?
What are you doing, you mug!
Go on!
You got no bollocks!
Come on, bruv,
he hit my fucking mum!
Come back when you've
grown a pair! Mugsy!
HARRY:
You throw away
your biggest opportunity
over a fucking dog.
And then you humiliate me
by stealing my boss's car.
You shot a dog
just to get a fucking job.
Yes, I did.
And Mr. Pickle here
reminds me of that
every time I take a shit.
You shot your dog
and had it stuffed?
You fucking freak.
No, I shot my dog, and then
I brought him home
and continued to care for him
for the next 11 years
until he died of pancreatitis.
What?!
It was a blank, Eggsy.
It was a fucking blank.
Remember Amelia?
Yeah.
She didn't drown.
She works in our tech department
in Berlin; she's fine.
Limits must be tested.
A Kingsman
only condones the risking
of a life to save another.
Like my dad saved your life even
though your fuck-up cost his.
Or have you got him
stuffed here and all?
Can't you see that
everything I've done
has been about trying
to repay him?
MERLIN:
Harry, listen to this.
Valentine's at last
saying something of note.
VALENTINE :
Know what I love
about pen and paper?
Nobody can hack into this shit.
Our worldwide tour
was a complete success.
We... have total coverall.
Like when all your numbers
in bingo are crossed out.
GAZELLE:
Bingo?
Bingo. The game.
You have played
bingo, right?
Do I look like
I play bingo?
Point is...
if our tests go well
:
at the church tomorrow,
we are good to go.
South Glade Mission Church.
Merlin, get the plane ready.
: Will do.
Harry, I'm so sorry.
I'm gonna do ev...
You should be.
You just stay right there.
I'll sort this mess out
when I get back.
CHURCH LEADER:
And I say to you, bear witness!
Watch the news.
MAN: You preach!
Watch the news... AIDS!
MAN 2: That's right!
Floods!
The blood of the innocent
spilled!
And yet,
there are those who doubt
this is the wrath of God.
Our filthy government
condones sodomy,
divorce...
abortion...
and yet, some still doubt
this is the work
of the Antichrist!
You do not have to be a Jew,
a nigger, a whore,
Praise the Lord! Amen!
Or a atheistic,
science-lovin'
evolution spouter...
MERLIN :
Charming sermon.
Can you see Valentine anywhere?
CHURCH LEADER:
So, my friends,
although he is a just God,
he is justly
:
a vengeful one,
and there can be
no turning back
:
from the Almighty...
You sure we're out of range?
We're over a thousand feet away.
What's wrong?
What if the calculations
are wrong?
You just have to trust me.
...Jew, nigger, fag-lovers,
and the Devil is burning them
for all eternity!
Would you excuse me?
Where are you going?
Hey. What's your problem?
I'm a Catholic whore
currently enjoying
congress out of wedlock
with my black,
Jewish boyfriend
who works in a military
abortion clinic.
So, hail Satan,
and have a lovely
afternoon, madam.
CHURCH LEADER: ...he may,
in fact, use us...
VALENTINE:
Oh, shit. He's leaving.
I'm starting the test now.
Let's hope enough of these
freaks have our SIM cards.
CHURCH LEADER:
Might I ask you to sit down,
my friend!
WOMAN: Just leave this church!
You just leave this church
like the infidel you are!
WOMAN:
Satan cannot save you now!
You will eat your babies!
You will drown
in the blood of the Lord!
He will not save you!
Holy fuck!
Aw, shit, I can't watch this.
Get over here.
¶ ¶
¶ ¶
Geez! Fuck.
MERLIN :
Galahad, can you hear me?
Harry!
Harry, what the heck
is going on?
Could you turn
the volume down, please?
I didn't expect it
to be that effective.
What kind of response
are we talking?
GAZELLE:
A hundred percent.
VALENTINE:
So everyone's been affected,
whether they have
a SIM card or not.
And we get the added benefit
of wiping out the Kingsman.
Not yet.
¶ ¶
¶ ¶
¶ ¶
:
Fuck!
Oh, you need to see this.
¶ ¶
¶ ¶
¶ ¶
¶ ¶
¶ ¶
HARRY:
What did you do to me?
I had no control.
I killed all those people.
I wanted to.
Clever, isn't it?
In simple terms,
it's a neurological wave
that triggers
the centers of aggression
and switches off inhibitors.
Transmitted through your nasty,
free SIM cards, I assume.
Do you know what
this is like?
It's like those
old movies we both love.
Now I'm gonna tell you my
whole plan, and then I'm gonna
come up with some absurd and
convoluted way to kill you,
and you'll find an equally
convoluted way to escape.
Sounds good to me.
Well, this ain't
that kind of movie.
No...!
¶ ¶
VALENTINE:
Is he dead?
That tends to happen when you
shoot someone in the head.
It feels good, right?
No, no,
it does not feel good.
It feels fucking awful.
What?! You just killed
how many people in that church?
This is one guy.
No, no, no,
they killed each other.
Okay, send out
the countdown clock.
This party starts...
tomorrow.
¶ ¶
¶ ¶
Arthur?
Are you there?
:
Sadly, I am.
Assemble the Kingsmen.
HARRY:
has been about
trying to repay him?
¶ ¶
HARRY:
who wants to do something good
with his life.
¶ ¶
Arthur,
Harry's dead.
Galahad...
is dead.
Hence, we have just drunk
a toast to him.
Well, then you know
what that psycho's doing.
How many people around the world
have got those SIM cards?
Valentine can send his signal
to any of them, all of them.
If they all go homicidal
at the same time, then...
Indeed.
And thanks to
Galahad's recordings,
we have Valentine's confession.
The intelligence
has been passed on
to the relevant authorities.
Our work is complete,
and a most distinguished
legacy for our fallen friend,
it is, too.
And that's it?
Come and sit down, boy.
This...
is an 1815 Napoleonic brandy,
and we only drink it
when we lose a Kingsman.
Galahad was very
fond of you.
And on this occasion,
I think it's acceptable
for us...
to bend the rules a little.
Are these all Kingsmen?
ARTHUR: Yes,
they're, uh, founder members.
I want you to join
me in a toast.
To Galahad.
To Galahad.
Harry says you don't like
to break rules, Arthur.
Why now?
You're very good, Eggsy.
Perhaps I will make you my
proposal for Galahad's position.
Provided, of course,
that we can see eye to eye
on certain political matters.
Can you guess...
...what this is?
I don't have to;
Harry showed me.
You click it, I die.
I thought that brandy tasted
a bit shit.
Bravo.
Valentine won you over...
somehow.
Once he explained, I understood.
VALENTINE:
you get a fever.
That's the human body
raising its core temperature
to kill the virus.
Planet Earth works
the same way.
Global warming is the fever.
Mankind is the virus.
We're making our planet sick.
A cull is our only hope.
If we don't reduce
our population ourselves,
there's only one
of two ways this can go.
The host kills the virus,
or the virus kills the host.
Either way...
ARTHUR:
is the same.
The virus dies.
So Valentine's gonna take care
of the population problem
himself.
Well, if we don't do
something, nature will.
Sometimes a culling
is the only way
to ensure that this
species survives.
And history will see Valentine
as the man who saved
humanity from extinction.
And he gets to pick and choose
who gets culled, does he?
All his rich mates,
they get to live,
and anyone he thinks
is worth saving,
he's keeping them safe,
whether they agree
with him or not.
And you... Eggsy.
In Harry's honor,
I am inviting you
to be part of a new world.
It's time to make your decision.
I'd rather be with Harry.
Thanks.
So be it.
The problem with us
common types is...
that we're light-fingered.
Kingsman's taught me
a lot, but...
sleight of hand...
Yes, they're, uh,
founder members.
...I had that down already.
You dirty little
fucking... prick.
It's okay, Lancelot.
Put it down.
It's verified.
Arthur's phone is
receiving update texts
about getting to safety...
We don't have a lot of time.
What are you gonna do?
Question is,
what are we gonna do?
God knows who's in Valentine's
pocket and who's not.
We have no choice.
We're gonna have to deal
with this ourselves.
Follow me.
¶ ¶
What the fuck is this?
I have no idea.
What you're playing with
is a prototype personal
trans-atmospheric vehicle.
It was developed
as part of Reagan's
Star Wars project.
It's pretty basic,
but... it should still work.
We're gonna take out
one of Valentine's satellites.
We're gonna break the
chain, stop the signal.
It'll take him a couple
of hours to reroute it,
which buys us enough time
for you to get me into
Valentine's mainframe so I can
shut it down.
Lancelot,
you're gonna be using it.
Get into your halo suit.
¶ ¶
PILOT :
MAN :
Please.
Thank you.
VALENTINE: So, how many more
are we expecting?
GAZELLE:
Not many.
Most have their own bunkers.
I figure we're just getting
the really nervous ones.
WOMAN:
Welcome, Prime Minister.
MERLIN:
can emit some kind
of counter signal
to ensure the wearer
remains unaffected
by the waves from
the SIM cards.
The waves that turn everyone
into a psycho killer.
Quite.
But what he probably
didn't tell anyone
is it can also super-heat their
soft tissue at his command.
Valentine selected
his chosen few
to get the countdown warning,
but he had to be sure
they didn't blab
to the wrong people beforehand.
How does this help us
right now?
It doesn't.
Roxy! Here we go!
¶ ¶
MERLIN: The higher you go,
the more the balloons expand.
When you reach the edge of
the atmosphere, they'll explode.
You'll need to deploy your
missile just before that, okay?
The edge of the atmosphere.
Once you've deployed,
you'll need to release
for descent fast.
Good luck.
You can do this, okay?
Yeah.
Eggsy, come on!
Time is not our friend.
¶ ¶
MERLIN:
You're gonna need to blend in.
I'm supposed to be Arthur?
His invitation's in his phone.
Give them this.
Give his real name:
Chester King.
What about you?
I'm your pilot...
I'm gonna stay here.
Is that gonna fit me?
A bespoke suit...
always fits.
Just be grateful
Harry had it made for you.
Get dressed.
What the fuck's wrong with them?
I don't know.
Could have something to do
with the mass genocide.
Give me the mic.
Hey-oh!
Everybody, listen up!
Hello, hello!
What the fuck is wrong
with you people?
I just want to remind you
that today
is a day of celebration.
We must put aside
all thoughts of death
and focus on birth.
The birth of a new age.
We mustn't mourn those
who give their lives today.
We should honor
their sacrifice...
Has she got my number to
call me back? I got a new phone.
VALENTINE: ...and their roles
in saving the human race.
We must put aside
doubt and guilt.
You are the chosen people.
When folks tell their kids
the story of Noah's Ark
is Noah the bad guy?
GROUP: No!
Is God the bad guy?
GROUP:
No!
How about the animals marching
two by two?
No!
Of course not!
Yeah, that's it!
Let's turn those frowns
upside down.
Eat, drink
and party...!
And I will see you all
in the new age.
¶ ¶
EGGSY :
Rox, It's me.
How's the view?
Hideous.
Mine's pretty sweet.
They made you
one of these suits yet?
:
No, not yet.
You've got something
to look forward to then.
We're coming up
on Valentine's base.
Gotta go.
Good luck.
Looking good, Eggsy.
Feeling good, Merlin.
MERLIN :
requesting permission to land.
MAN :
Fuck me.
Mm-hmm.
MERLIN:
we're on.
Chester King.
Mr. King, welcome.
I'm sure you've
adhered to Valentine's
strict no-weapons policy,
but if you don't object...
Of course.
Thank you.
Do you have any luggage?
Congratulations, Mycroft,
you just graduated
from my pilot to my valet.
You cheeky...
Understood?
Good.
Thank you.
¶ ¶
MERLIN : Eggsy,
find a laptop, get me online.
The clock is ticking.
And remember, try to blend in.
Would sir care for a drink?
Martini.
Gin, not vodka, obviously.
Stirred for ten seconds
while glancing at
an unopened bottle of vermouth.
Thank you.
Merlin, are you clocking this?
Yes, I am.
Stay focused.
Lancelot, you're doing great.
Not much further to go.
:
Yes, Merlin.
MERLIN:
Eggsy, get me online now.
EGGSY:
Yep, I'm on it.
Lancelot, you're approaching
your altitude limit.
Those balloons won't last
much longer.
Prepare to engage missile.
Society's dead.
Long live society.
Amen to that.
I'm Morten Lindstrom.
Chester King.
How'd you get online?
I couldn't.
Oh, well,
it's a closed network, you see.
Pre-authorized
connections only.
Ah.
I've got a fix on the satellite.
EGGSY:
Do you have the correct time?
I think I'm still
in my last time zone.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Let's see now.
MERLIN:
Eggsy, I'm in.
Get your arse
back to the plane, now.
On my way.
Lancelot, good luck!
Firing in three,
two...
Nice and slow.
Fuck are you doing here?
Well, my family
were invited, obviously.
Now, get the fuck up.
Slowly.
MERLIN:
Lancelot, hurry up and fire!
That other balloon
is gonna blow!
Yes, Merlin.
I've nearly got it.
Give me a second!
Valentine!
I've caught a fucking spy!
V-Glass, zoom.
Oh, fuck!
It's that young valet.
Son of a bitch.
ROXY:
Got it!
VALENTINE:
Oh, shit.
Sound the alarm!
I'm not taking any chances.
Okay, you send out
the two-minute warning.
I'm starting the override.
All right, let's do this.
FEMALE AUTOMATED VOICE:
Countdown initiated.
You see him?
Right here.
MERLIN:
Eggsy, take a left.
Two guards, up ahead.
Lancelot, release now!
MERLIN:
There's two more.
All right,
everybody on your feet!
Countdown to V-day!
Welcome in the new age!
Aah! Flat spin!
MERLIN:
Eggsy, next left,
down the narrow tunnel!
VALENTINE:
Ten,
five,
two,
one!
MERLIN:
Nice!
:
Well done, both of you.
It's not working!
It's supposed to be working!
What the fuck?
EGGSY :
Yes!
Well done, Rox. Good girl.
We've lost one of
our satellites.
Oh, no, no.
There's no way
I can hack past that.
What's going on?
Is there a problem?
Come on,
there's no need for guns.
I'm just a pilot.
Fuck.
Merlin!
Get in here!
Come on!
Let's get the fuck out of here!
We can't.
I can't get
into Valentine's machine.
He's got biometric security.
You're gonna have
to get in there
and make sure his hand
never touches that desk.
Are you taking the fucking piss?
I'm afraid not.
Let's have that then.
Uh-uh.
This is mine.
I'll show you yours.
Good choice.
VALENTINE:
How long to re-link
the satellite chain?
It'll take an hour,
maybe two.
Bullshit! Just bring
these two closer together.
But that's not yours.
V-Glass, call E-man.
E, it's V.
Listen, man, I got
a little hiccup on this end.
I need to piggyback.
One of my satellites
just went down,
but it's right next
to one of yours.
You read my mind.
How long before
you make that happen?
Go.
All right,
we should be coming back online.
Ten percent.
Oh, shit!
Eggsy, Valentine's using
someone else's satellite.
:
He's going to reconnect
the chain.
It's going to take him
no time at all.
It's at 20 percent.
Eggsy, it seems Valentine's got
a present for you.
Get a move on!
Is that Kingsman kid dead yet?
Not yet, but he will be soon.
Good.
Merlin, I'm fucked.
As am I.
They're coming at me
from both sides.
I'm out of options.
Rox, Rox, I need a favor.
Call my mum.
Tell her to lock herself
away from Dean.
:
tell her I love her.
Oh, for fuck's sake.
Merlin, remember those implants
you said were of no use to us?
Any chance you can turn them on?
All right.
My turn to play, Valentine.
Oh, oh, no!
No, no, what the fuck is he...
I can't stop this.
Yes, please.
No!
¶ ¶
MERLIN:
Oh, my God!
That is fucking spectacular!
Merlin, you're a fucking genius!
WOMAN:
What the fuck is
happening out there?
Aren't you that princess
who went missing?
Can you get me out?
If I do,
will you give me a kiss?
I've always wanted
to kiss a princess.
If you get me out right now,
I'll give you more
than just a kiss.
VALENTINE :
You motherfucker.
Did you really think
I was stupid enough
to implant one of those things
in my own head?
What are you, fucking crazy?
All those innocent people
killed, and for what?
You didn't stop shit!
Yeah, fine,
I've locked the door.
What do you want me to do now?
As I said,
put your daughter
in the bathroom
and throw away the key.
VALENTINE:
It's still happening!
You're fucking insane.
ROXY:
Just do it.
¶ ¶
What the hell?
What the...?
MERLIN:
Eggsy, the signal's started!
Get Valentine's hand off
that bloody desk now!
Sorry, love.
Gotta save the world.
If you save the world,
we can do it in the asshole.
I'll be right back.
Good luck!
¶ ¶
London.
¶ ¶
¶ ¶
GAZELLE :
Rio!
¶ ¶
¶ ¶
Get down!
You did it!
GAZELLE: The glass
is not gonna hold long.
You stay here.
Merlin, quickly,
how do I get up there?
Keep shooting.
I'll find a route.
Understood.
Holy fuck!
: We're back up!
We're back up!
:
This is great!
¶ ¶
MERLIN:
Eggsy! Fuckin' get on with it!
VALENTINE:
Kick his ass, Gazy!
¶ ¶
VALENTINE:
Seoul, Caracas, Mumbai!
¶ ¶
MAN:
I'll kick your ass!
VALENTINE:
kill that motherfucker!
He killed all our friends!
¶ ¶
¶ ¶
MERLIN :
Eggsy...
the world is going to shit!
¶ ¶
Is he dead yet?!
Not yet!
Stop playing with your food!
Kill him!
¶ ¶
Gazelle!
Gazelle!
MERLIN:
come on!
MERLIN :
Kill him!
:
Fuck.
Gazelle...!
Hey-hey!
MERLIN :
Well done, son!
Yes! Yes, Eggsy!
Well done, Eggsy.
And you, Lancelot.
I'm so sorry.
Mummy would never hurt you.
Mummy would never hurt you.
I'm so sorry.
:
You okay?
Harry would be proud
of you, Eggsy.
He was right.
¶ ¶
What's up, man?
Is this the part where you say
some... really bad pun?
Well, it's like you
said to Harry.
This ain't
that kind of movie, bruv.
Perfect.
¶ ¶
Eggsy, where are you going?
There's no need for champagne.
We got loads in the plane.
¶ ¶
Did you save the world?
Yes, I did.
So... you gonna come in?
Yes, I am.
Merlin, the cell's locked...
How do I get in?
Twenty-six,
:
Twenty-five.
Merlin...
you're the guv'nor.
MERLIN :
You owe me, Eggsy.
Eggsy?
Oh.
Oh, my word.
¶ ¶
¶ ¶
Michelle, turn that shit off.
It's doing my nuts in.
EGGSY:
I rather like that song.
Leave it on, eh, Mum?
¶ ¶
Mugsy's back.
You finally come to have that
word with me, have you, son?
Or are you gonna
run away again
and pretend you're going
to court dressed like that?
Oh, you mean this.
No.
I know this bloke
who's just taken over a
tailor's shop on Savile Row.
He's given me a job, Mum.
Comes with a lot of perks.
Including a house.
Come and live
with me there, Mum.
Come on.
Sit down, you.
Only place she'll be visiting
is you in fucking hospital.
Do you hear?
Just leave him alone, Dean!
Eggsy, go.
Please, just go, babe.
All right.
Yes, do as Mummy says.
Why don't you ask
that tailor friend of yours
to knock up
a nice chicken costume...
It'd suit you, you mug.
¶ ¶
As a good friend once said...
"Manners...
"...maketh...
...man."
Hey...
Shut the fuck up.
DEAN:
Eggsy, I'm gonna shove
your manners
up your fuck...
So...
are we gonna
stand around here all day,
or are we gonna fight?
