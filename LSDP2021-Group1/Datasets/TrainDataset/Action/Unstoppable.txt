We're working together
today on train 1 206.
That's the one.
That's the profile?
Yeah.
Want to take a look?
How you doing?
Is there a problem?
No problem.
I just don't like working
in a damn day-care center.
Yeah. well.
I don't like working at
a retirement home. so...
All right.
I'll tell you what.
I'm gonna finish my coffee.
I'll meet you on the wagon.
Sounds good.
Yeah. That's the one.
You know that punk's
union. right?
Heard they just made him
a shop steward at the UTU.
First year?
CLARK: You know
how he got hired?
His name's Colson.
His two uncles are running
things over at Thornwood
and his brother's
lead welder at Deacon.
The whole family's
from Stanton.
That figures.
Here.
they're shit-canning
guys every day.
but you got
the right last name
and a rookie's pay grade.
you got a job.
BUNNY: What the hell
are these guys?
Dewey. Gilleece.
Sorry to break up
charm school,
but what
the hell is that beast
still doing on D-1 6?
I told you I need
that track clear.
Relax. buddy.
We were just
about to move it.
Like hell you are.
I've got 1 50 school students
coming in on some
field trip on D-1 6.
I need that track cleared.
D-1 0's clear.
You can set it there.
All right. All right.
settle down. Settle down.
Welcome to the
Railroad Safety Campaign.
We're a not-for-profit program
designed to educate
young people like yourselves
about railway safety.
Hey. settle down.
Show of hands.
Who's ridden a train before?
Me!.
Me!.
All right! All aboard!
So what's our day?
They got us going
on light power.
We're supposed
to pick up 25 cars
just past Stanton
then it's pretty
much a straight shot
through Wilkins.
Any slow orders?
No.
You sure?
They'd be highlighted in red.
No. No slow orders.
All right.
BUNNY ON RADIO:
Dewey, what the hell
is taking you so long?.
It's a 39-car consist.
Bunny.
The thing's half a mile long.
for Christ's sake.
Gilleece. channel up.
GILLEECE: Go for Gilleece.
You believe this shit?
Hey. hold up.
You forgot to tie
the air in from the point.
Yeah. so?
So. you don't
have any air brakes.
You can tie the hoses
once we got her parked
and Bunny's quit
his bitching.
Okay.
I only got one rule.
One rule only.
You gonna do something.
you do it right.
You don't
know how to do it.
ask me. all right?
Likewise. if you
need anything from me.
you better speak up
'cause you're
the conductor.
Once we get our freight.
it's your train.
I'm just the guy
driving it.
How long you been
out of training?
About four months.
Four months? Wow.
Yeah.
Full-on yellow vest rookie.
How long you

Twenty-eight years.

Something different?

The POS releases are in.
Filled out our time slips.
We're good to go.
Good. All right.
You're at 29 cars.
You got 1 0 to go.
You're good.
Dewey, you got 29.
Ten more makes...
You taking PB-9
over to D-1 0?
Dewey.
Dewey.
Hold your horses.
What's wrong?
Damn trailing point switch.
The track's aligned for D-1 6.
What's your
stopping distance?
At least 20 cars
to a stop. Damn it!
Okay. so we back it up
and lose a little time.
I'm hopping out.
Do not get out
of that cab. man!
Don't worry.
I'll set the independent.
Dewey! Dewey!.
Come on,
get back on.
Dewey!
You better get back on!
I'm on it. I'm on it.
Shit!
You better get
back on. dickhead.
Hey!
Shit!
MAN: Nice job. Dewey!
God damn it!
So now what the hell
do we do?
Shoot.
Ooh. you're in trouble.
Just don't talk about it.
Just put your sister on
the phone. sweetheart.
Dad.
She doesn't want
to talk to you.
Listen. Just tell her
I was... I didn't forget.
I was just...
I was running late.
She's got a date tonight.
With who?
Just put your
sister on the phone.
Wait. Here she is.
FRANK: Nic?.
Nicky?
Hello?
Listen. just...
Baby, look,
I didn't forget.
I was...
Frank.
the stop blocks are up.
Is there a problem?
No. there's no problem.
except you got it backwards.
Turntable house
goes on my end.
You're on the ballast.
On my end.
Other than that, no problem.
No problem at all.
Like I told you.
if you don't know something.
just ask. That's all.
I got it.
I hope so.
Whatever.
Excuse me?
This shit. This
"Let's make the new guy
prove himself"" bullshit.
I gotta tell you.
I've heard it before
and it gets old real fast.
Well. that's how it is
at the retirement home.
Company wants to get
rid of us old heads.
They give all the jobs
to you new guys.
you yellow vests.
I'm not trying
to take anything
from anybody.
As reassuring as that is.
a lot of guys
don't see it that way.
I'm here.
I'm walking in right now.
I got a car full of donuts
for those kids.
A coaster? What train?
DEWEY: Connie?
How the hell
did this happen?
It just got away from me.
It got away from you?
It's a train. Dewey.
not a chipmunk.
I had to leave the cab
to throw a switch.
You left the cab?
GILLEECE: Yeah.
And it gets worse.
The air brakes
weren't tied on.
They aren't tied on. still.
We've got an
unmanned train rolling
into opposing traffic
with no air brakes.
is that what
you're telling me?
I set the independent brakes.
That'll for sure stop it.
How fast is it going?
No more than 1 0 miles per.
Okay.
Jump on the hi-rail
and go after it.
Now!.
Okay. ballbuster.
Call the field trip!
I don't care where
they are on the main line.
they need to get
into the nearest siding.
RS Campaign. RS Campaign.
This is Fuller Yard.
Do you copy?
RSC answering dispatch.
How can I help you? Over.
RS Campaign.
this is Fuller Yard.
We've got
unauthorized activity
on your track.
We're gonna need you
to divert to a siding
at Portville.
Dispatch. please repeat.
Please repeat. Over.
What time is train time?
ALL: Anytime!
Divert to a siding
in Portville. Do you copy?
I copy.
I'll divert into the siding
at Portville. Over.
Get me 777's
cargo information.
I have to
call corporate
and report this.
Now. Dewey said
he applied the independent.
so friction should
stop the damn thing
after a few miles.
Still. we need to alert
every northbound
train on the mainline.
First 20 miles of
track take priority.
I don't care if
you're talking about
a spot weld on
a Class 3 rip track
or ground operations
in Afghanistan.
it's all about precision.
WAITRESS: Right.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
Sure.
Hello.
Ned. where are you?
Oh. Connie.
I'm just driving in now.
I got to go.
How far are you
from milepost 5?
Roughly six minutes.
traffic contingent.
Great. I need you to
haul ass over there
and throw the siding switch.
We got a coaster.
A coaster? Really?
Yeah.
It should roll past MP 5
in about 1 5 minutes.
That should give
you enough time
to throw the switch.
get it off the mainline
and onto that siding.
You want me to climb
onboard and stop it?
What? No.
Two hostlers are on the way.
Just throw the switch. Ned.
Roger that.
You can always
count on him to be late.
I'll see you later.
See you!
Yeah, I can get you
where you need to go
'Cause I'm a country boy
What do we do when we
get to a railroad crossing?
ALL: Stop. Iook and listen!
I can't hear you!
ALL: Stop. Iook and listen!
You from Stanton?
Born and raised.
Yeah?
My whole family's
from Stanton.
Married?
Yeah.
Well. sort of.
It's a long story.
We got a long day.
How about you?
You married?
Short story. Once.
Got two beautiful daughters.
though. 1 8. 1 9.
They are both waitressing.
trying to work their
way through college.
Oh. yeah?
Yeah.
Where at?
Hooters.
Hooters. You know?
All right.
That's right. Hooters.
Wipe that grin off your face.
I'm a fan.
Yeah.
You're blushing.
I'm used to it.
I'm used to it.
BUNNY ON INTERCOM: Connie.
Corporate on line 2.
This is Connie Hooper
at Fuller Yard.
I'll hold.
Did I hear right?
You've got a coaster?
Yeah.
This sort of thing happens.
We're on it.
Won't it trip a relay?
Listen. I need to speak
to Mr. Galvin directly.
I see.
Can you have him
call me. then?
No. I'm about to review
the cargo shipment myself.
Who the hell are you?
I'm here for the
Railroad Safety Campaign.
Scott Werner. FRA Region 2.
Federal Safety Inspector.
I'm supposed to give
a presentation
to the children.
go over some basic stuff.
That's great.
Hey. Bunny? Bunny!
Can you help me out here?
Okay. see this
guy right there?
He's gonna tell
you where to sit.
Track geometry.
alignment...
Thank you so much.
I brought some gauges...
The kids are gonna
love that. It's great.
God damn it.
Where the hell
is this thing?
Bunny?
I need to know exactly
what's in cars 7 to 1 0.
Get a hold of
the shipper. please.
Are you kidding me?
Where's the train?
Where does it look like
the goddamn train is?
It's not here!
What are you
doing out here?
Do I look like
I got a train hidden
in my back pocket?
Bunny. get me Connie.
It's Ned.
Get behind us. jackass.
Did you get here too late?
Don't give me that shit.
You two numbnuts
are always screwing up.
You switched the track
that was supposed to get
the train on the right track.
Connie. Yeah. it's Ned.
Did you throw
that switch yet?
Yeah. six minutes ago.
but your train.
it's not here.
I thought it might be
going a little slower
than you guessed,
but these two numbnuts
that you sent.
they just showed up
and they ain't
seen it. either.
Are you saying our
train's already passed?
Yes. ma'am.
That'd be my guess.
It's not a coaster.
That train's under power.
That'd be my guess. too.
Put Dewey on the phone.
Sure.
She wants to talk
to you. asshole.
Yeah.
I need you to
rally every cell in
that brain of yours.
When you applied
the independent.
was the throttle in
the forward position?
Yeah. I had to
get it moving!
In what position
was the throttle set?
Damn it. Dewey.
what position?
Connie. the throttle
was in notch 8. full power.
Okay?. It was 39 cars!
Okay.
Take the southbound track.
Catch up.
See if it's still
going slow enough
for one of you to climb on.
You have got until milepost 1 3
before the track splits.
Let me talk to Ned again.
Nice job. asshole!
Ned. I want you to
get back in your car
and follow the mainline. Okay?
I want a set of
eyes on that train.
You got them. Roger that.
I can't hear you!
ALL: Railroad Safety Campaign!
You're good.
Keep it coming. 50.
Slow down.
All right. you're good.
Yeah.
What's going on?
You got a minute?
I thought he said
it was looking good.
That's what he thought.
Turns out
the judge they assigned
was a real hard-ass.
You gotta be kidding me.
Look. the restraining order
is being continued for
another 30 days.
Thirty days?
What am I supposed
to do for 30 days?
Stay away from my kid?.
And then there's
another hearing
after that. I guess.
What's taking
you so long. Will?
You call that lawyer.
you can tell him
he can stick it
up his ass. I got to go.
FRANK: Will,
pick up the radio.
Will. pick up the radio.
Over.
Are you there?.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Get off the phone.
knock off the hand brakes.
get up here.
It's time to go.
We got work to do.
Copy.
No. it's definitely
under power.
We're not sure of
the exact speed yet.
I thought all these trains
had some sort of
dead-man brake.
There's a wand the engineer
has to hit periodically
or the air brakes are
automatically applied.
Unfortunately.
this train's air brakes
were disconnected.
Sir, I would gladly
explain the particulars of
locomotive operation to you
if we had time.
but right now I really
need your assistance
posting officers at
all the mainline crossings.
One question.
How do you all
plan to stop it?
We're working on it.
Go. go. go!
The split's coming up!
Are you sure
you can do this?
Just get
alongside of the cab.
Get up alongside of it!
I'm trying!
Go. go. go!
Remember. we don't have
a lot of track!
You got it. go. go!
Dewey!
It's too fast! Back it up!
Come on. Dewey! Go back!
Jump. Gilleece!
Do it!
Get in! Watch out!
GILLEECE: So now
what the hell do we do?
How many cars are we
supposed to cut in?
Twenty. Why?
Twenty cars. okay.
See the switch stand
up ahead of us?
The switch stand. yeah?
Uh-huh.
Take a look in
the rear view mirror.
You see the one behind us?
Way back there.
You see it?
Uh-huh.
There's exactly 21 cars
between the two stands.
Don't ask me how I know.
So why is it that
there's still more
than four and a half cars
that are yet to clear?
Because I...
Excuse me?
Because I cut...
Because what?
I cut in too many cars.
Cut in too many cars. huh?
Maybe if you
weren't on my ass
the whole time.
I might be able
to think straight
and do my job.
What do you mean.
""Maybe. if I...""
You been on my
ass this whole trip!
You're blaming it on me?
I'm just saying.
pick a goddamn job!
I got my job!
You pick one!
I pull the throttle.
you pull the pin!
It's one or the other!
You're five pins too many.
Pull the pins.
You're right.
pull the pins.
I've had my training!
All right?
Yeah. but we're out
here in the real world.
This ain't training.
In training.
they just give you an F.
Out here. you get killed.
I screwed up. okay?
Yes. you did.
Stop and roll back and
I'll cut the empties.
Roll back?
Oh. Lord.
We can't stop out
here on the main.
We're more than
a mile out on the main.
more than a mile
to the next stop.
You don't take
a consist this size
that distance in reverse.
Fine.
Then we'll make the turn
at the next siding.
The next siding's
not for 1 0 miles.
We do that. we're late.
I don't run late.
Just green-sheet it
and we'll move on.
Come on. We green-sheet it
and it's my ass!
Cut me some slack.
What do you mean.
it's your ass?
You're a Colson.
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?
That means you
can call your uncle
and they'll take care of it.
Is that what
this is about?
No. it's about
the five cars too many.
We're gonna stop. roll back
and cut those empties!
This may be your engine.
but it's my goddamn train.
Yes. it is.
I'm the goddamn conductor!
That's true.
MALE DISPATCHER ON RADIO:
I'll write you up and
green-sheet your ass.
Will you?
How about that?
What's your location?. Over.
Something's funny?
No.
What the hell are
you laughing at?
What are you laughing at?
Because it's funny.
You're a funny guy.
Well-trained. but funny.
Yeah. this is 1 206.
We're 60 miles
from Wilkins.
Forty minutes
out of Fuller Yard.
Negative. 1 206.
Clear your train
at the next siding
until further instructed.
Over.
What's up?
There's an unmanned train
out of Fuller, on the
northbound track. Over.
On our track?
A coaster?
all the details yet.
Just proceed to
the next siding
and hold tight. Over.
Next siding's
not for 1 0 miles.
Affirmative, 1206.
Just get in that
siding and sit tight
until we give you
the all-clear. Over.
Affirmative.
It's coming right at us.
More word on that
runaway freight train
in rural Pennsylvania.
The train, A WVR777,
otherwise known as 777,
Ieft Fuller
Yard in northern PA
sometime before 8: 00 a. m.
this morning
and no one was onboard.
MALE AN NOU NCER:
Live, local,
late-breaking.
The engineer, they say,
made an error in
controlling the train.
Before leaving
the locomotive,
he intended to apply
the independent brakes.
And then by the time
he realized his mistake,
the train was going too fast
for him to climb back on.
We're being told
now by a spokesperson
for the Public
Utilities Commission
that this employee
will be held accountable.
Connie?
Yeah.
Headquarters is
on the phone. It's Galvin.
Mr. Galvin. how are you?
God damn it.
How could this happen?
It's an unfortunate
combination of human error
and bad luck.
Luck?
I was a yardmaster
for 1 0 years. Ms. Hooper.
Luck has no business
in a rail yard.
What are we worried about
in terms of cargo?.
Well. obviously.
the diesel fuel's a concern.
No, I said cargo.
Okay. well.
cars 7 through 1 0
and 1 6 through 1 9
are carrying a chemical
called molten phenol.
We're still trying to
connect with the shipper
to determine
exactly what that is.
It's used in
the manufacture of glue.
Can you hold on
one moment?
You know about
molten phenol?
Yes.
Mr. Galvin. we have
an FRA inspector here.
May I put you on speaker?
Region 2 Federal
Safety Inspector Scott Werner.
How can I help?
Just tell me what you know
about molten phenol.
Well. it's serious stuff.
Very toxic.
highly combustible.
Oh, that's terrific.
Hooper. get state
police back on the line.
Make sure they
got a HazMat team
briefed and ready.
And ask them to
put a spotter chopper
over 777.
I take it you've
sided all rail traffic?
CONNIE: On our end, yes.
Brewster's notifying its own.
Sir.
how are we going
to handle this?
I mean. this train
is en route to pass
through some
highly populated areas.
We're having a strategy call
in about two minutes.
All right. I'll be ready.
You won't be on
the call. Ms. Hooper.
Excuse me?
You'll be advised.
For now. coordinate
with local authorities.
God knows we gotta have
over 1 00 crossings that
need to be secured.
One hundred
and seventy-three.
Railroad crossings.
Between here and AWVR
substation in Brewster.
Listen. Mr. Galvin.
this train is half a mile
long and is traveling
at speed into population
with eight freight cars of
hazardous chemicals
and 5, 000 gallons
of diesel fuel.
Sir, we're not just talking
about a train here.
We're talking about
a missile the size of
the Chrysler Building.
So. what is your
point. Ms. Hooper?
My point is
after it crosses
through Findlay.
there's about 1 2 miles
of vacant farmland.
but after that. it's nothing
but town after town
all the way to Stanton.
We have a very
limited window here.
So. what are you
suggesting we do.
derail it?
Yes. sir. I am.
While we still can.
Mr. Galvin. I understand
that's gonna cost the company
a lot of money...
Do you think?.
Ms. Hooper. we're not
gonna intentionally destroy
one of our own trains.
Not when we can
still stop it.
We can avoid
a lot of collateral...
I'm going to extend you
my last ounce of good will
and pretend this conversation
never happened.
He thinks I'm worried
about my job.
Ma'am.
please stay in your van.
Come on.
Please get back
into the van.
FEMALE REPORTER:
Can you please tell us
what's going on?
Every crossing's
closed off for 20 miles.
Ma'am. for your safety.
please get back into your van.
I'm not getting
back in the vehicle.
We need to know
what's going on.
Guys. get out of there.
There's a train coming.
WOMAN: Hurry!
Hurry! It's coming!
MAN: Come on. We got to go.
Get out of there! Move it!
Get out of the way!
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
We're not gonna
fit in that siding.
that's what's wrong.
in the siding yet?
What's your location?.
FRANK: No, we're not in
the hole. We're not gonna
make it, can't do it.
Too much train.
I'm gonna need you
to realign the switch
so we can proceed
to the next siding.
get off the main. Over.
I understand that.
but you gotta
understand this.
we're not going to fit.
That siding's a good
Check your timetable.
it's gonna tell you
the siding is 4. 1 1 1 feet.
But that's
signal to signal.
In reality.
it's more like 2.500 feet.
You add those five cars
that you picked up...
We can fit.
No, we won't fit.
Dispatch. this is 1 206.
Can you tell me where
the nearest rip track is?
there's one in 6.2 miles.
How fast are you going?
Why? Is that coaster
still on the main?
I repeat, it is not a coaster.
Over.
You're telling me
it's under power?
Get in the goddamn siding.
that rip track is
confirmed vacant.
It's your call, Frank.
We need to throw the switch
if you're staying on.
We're not staying on!
Pull the brake. Frank.
We pull the brake
and side up. I crash.
I know what
the hell I'm doing.
Bullshit!
You're gonna get us killed.
Hey!
an answer. Over.
Realign the switch.
Over.
The train was just going
with no one in it.
Just took off.
We were yelling on
the radio earlier,
there's a runaway
train coming through.
It could be coming
to our town next
and the high school's
right next to those
train tracks.
FEMALE REPORTER:
Just a few moments ago,
a train came barreling down
these tracks...
We're still going
over the numbers.
but should 777 derail.
we're looking at
a major disaster.
If even one of
those HazMat cars blew.
it could easily
decimate an entire town.
That train is carrying
eight of them.
Can you please
explain to our viewers
what you witnessed...
Environmental liability.
track damage.
car and locomotive loss.
We're looking at
a projected cost
easily over $1 00 million.
And the resulting
stock devaluation?
Our projections
indicate it could be
in the 30 to 40% range.
Oh!
I say we go with
Mr. Galvin's option.
I've already prepped
our substation in Brewster.
They just need a go-ahead.
You have it.
Okay. everybody out.
Hoffman. you stay here.
Baker.
get me a track schematic.
Fuller to Stanton. please.
This is Owens.
So the red means?
Everything in red means
trouble on the mainline.
That's a lot of red.
WOMAN ON INTERCOM: Connie,
Mr. Galvin on line 2.
ON SPEAKERPHONE:
This is Connie Hooper.
Have all the
mainline crossings
been closed?
Yes, I've been
coordinating with PSP.
Do we have
a strategy in place?
It's already underway.
By the activity
level behind me,
it is evident that
a plan to stop the
runaway train is underway,
but so far,
no one at AWVR
is commenting.
We just witnessed
A WVR employee Ryan Scott
boarding one of
the rescue helicopters.
He is a 22-year-old
Marine vet who has just
returned from Afghanistan.
What the hell is this?
I need a police escort now!
Whoa!
It says here
you're a welder.
Lead welder.
Listen. buddy.
I don't got a lot of time.
You can call my yardmaster.
Connie Hooper!
Connie sent you?
That's what I said.
I need your help.
ON RADIO:
At over 2.000.
you wouldn't have fit.
Good call. Over.
Thank you.
but I need to know where
that oncoming train is.
How far away is it?
You're not sure?
Well. find out!
I'm high above
central Pennsylvania.
This train got away...
Emergency
responders want to halt
all activity near the line
and possibly
evacuate all homes
within a mile
radius of the tracks.
There's thousands
of gallons of fuel onboard,
which is highly flammable.
But we're still
awaiting word on that.
This is Galvin's strategy?
MALE REPORTER: Looks like
they're putting a train
in front of 777
in an attempt
to slow it down.
Now, they are sending
a chopper with Ryan Scott
and the railroad company
is still refusing to comment.
We've just learned that
veteran Judd Stewart
is at the controls
of the engine
that is in front of
the runaway train.
This is Connie Hooper
from Fuller Yard.
Is this your guy
coming off the helicopter?
Still holding at 55.
Get her down to 40
and keep braking.
Shit!
That's it. Keep going.
Keep slowing.
Get her down to 40
and we'll set our boy down.
MALE REPORTER: Unbelievable!
Do this!
Come on.
...incredibly dangerous...
Do this. Judd. come on!
I'm under 40.
Is he on yet?
Now!
MALE REPORTER:
Looks like Marine Ryan Scott
has been injured.
It's a no-go.
Slow down!
Just keep braking.
Try to slow it.
Try to get 777 off the main.
Switch has been thrown.
Slow down. God damn it!
Don't side it yet!
It's going too fast.
Bail! Bail! Bail!
Holy shit!
Maybe it derailed.
MALE REPORTER: Wow!
I can't believe
how crazy that was.
Oh. my God!
Galvin. you asshole!
Fuller Yard.
Fuller Yard. This is 1 206.
We're passing milepost 52.
heading northbound
on the Main 1.
speaking with?
Frank Barnes. the engineer.
This is Connie Hooper.
yardmaster at Fuller.
Why are you still
on the mainline?
We were directed to
a siding that's a no-go.
We're heading to a rip track
just past milepost 5-0.
We need to know the location
of your yard's train.
It just passed milepost 47.
Holy shit.
They tried to side it.
but it jumped the switch
and derailed the lash-up.
Lash-up? Who was driving?
FEMALE REPORTER: The engineer,
a 26-year rail
company veteran,
was killed earlier today
in Keating Summit,
central Pennsylvania.
Judd Stewart.
Stewart?
You said Stewart?
Judd Stewart.
an engineer from Brewster.
You know him?
What's your power
on the point?
She's not a hotshot.
but she's still got
some life left in her. over.
Give her all you got.
Tell Galvin we got two guys
out on the mainline
about to play chicken
with our train.
We tried to stop it.
We blew it.
What?
HOFFMAN: That train's
got to go down.
The only question is
how to minimize the damage.
Quiet!
We just learned there is yet
another train on this track,
headed directly
at the runaway.
GALVIN: What the hell
is this?
We gotta learn
about it on damn TV?
Nicole.
Listen. don't hang up.
Don't hang up.
Dad. I'm busy. Okay?
Okay, I understand.
Dad?.
I just wanted to
tell you I love you.
that's all.
Okay. fine!
Dad. what's wrong?
Nothing. nothing.
I just...
Dad. what's wrong?
Just tell your sister
I love you both. okay?
I got to go.
What's wrong?
holding up?
About a half a mile from
that rip track. Over.
Chances are
you're going to see
FRANK: Affirmative.
Why are you braking?
Trust me. If we head
in this hot. we'll tear
right off the track.
Oh. Jesus.
Get her down to 40
and brace yourself.
You need to get at least
Yes!
CLARK ON RADIO:
Frank, go to 6.
Frank, go to 6.
Yeah. I'm at 6. Go.
They're evacuating Arklow.
They're going to
derail the train.
What are they using?
Standard DRE.
Yeah.
a portable derailer.
WILL: What are you doing?
I got a look at that train's
last coupler knuckle.
it was open.
We take off right now.
we get back on the main.
we can chase it
down in reverse.
Chase?
Whoa. wait a minute.
The only way to stop
that kind of power.
grab it by the tail.
boom. gun it in
the opposite direction.
We can't just chase it down.
If it goes down.
we're gonna be
a wreck on a wreck.
Doesn't matter.
There's a good chance
the derailer won't work.
It's called a derailer.
for Christ's sake!
That's what they do!
A train that size
going that fast.
it will vaporize anything
that gets in its way.
Bullshit!
They wouldn't use it if...
They're wrong. all right?
They're wrong.
Are you in or are you out?
You want to get
yourself killed.
you do it alone.
You know what?
Ask your wife
what she thinks.
Wait!
If you're right and
that derailer fails.
what are the odds it
makes it to Stanton?
You saw the train.
What do you think?
Are you there?
Just wanted to see
how you boys are doing.
We're doing about 60
mile an hour. Connie.
Sorry? Frank.
I don't understand.
We're going
after your train.
The rear knuckle
was left open.
so if we can catch up.
we can tie it on
to our locomotive.
try and slow down 777.
Frank. you can't.
We already are.
Portable derailer's
not gonna cut it. Connie.
Who said anything
about a derailer?
Dispatch.
they said that they're
evacuating Arklow.
Two plus two is four.
It's Ned. He said
he's still following...
No. No. No.
Tell him I'll call him back.
Get me Galvin. now.
Frank. that train's
carrying 30.000 gallons
of toxic chemicals.
They had a window before.
but that train's going
into populated areas.
There's no way
they'd derail it now.
Are you sure about that?
Look. Iet me
make some calls.
Make some calls. Please.
What do you think?
Do you think
they can catch up?
Possibly.
But even if they do.
we're talking about
coupling at 1 0 times
the normal speed. in reverse.
I thought you were
in favor of derailment.
Yeah. when they were
in the middle of nowhere.
not now.
It's just town
after town out there!
Mr. Galvin says he'd
have to call you back.
This is Connie Hooper
for Mr. Galvin.
WOMAN: Mr. Galvin is
in a meeting.
Then maybe you can tell me.
Is the company planning
on derailing 777?
Last I heard.
Galvin was dead
set against it.
I'm sorry,
I'd really like to
help you, Ms. Hooper.
But I'm not at liberty
to give you that information.
No. of course
you're not at liberty to.
Frank's right.
What's the fastest
you've taken a single
engine like this?
Unattached?
Yeah.
Fifty. 55.
Of course.
I was going forward.
CONNIE ON RADIO:
This is 1 206. over.
Frank, you're right.
About the derailment.
They're planning an attempt
outside of Arklow.
Tell them idiots
it ain't gonna work.
That portable derailer.
it's worthless.
She already told us.
Frank. this is Oscar Galvin.
VP of Operations.
patched in at his request.
open mike.
Yeah.
we're derailing 777. Frank.
It's a done decision.
Like it or not,
it's our best option
at this stage.
There'll be less collateral
damage in Arklow.
It's already being evacuated.
and we can't let 777
make it to Stanton.
Look. Mr. Galvin.
with all due respect.
I've been railroading
I'm telling you.
we got a real chance
to stop this thing.
No. we already tried.
That was from the front.
We're long hood lead back.
It's a different situation.
We got more control now.
What if I cancel the derailer
and you fail. Frank?
That train will be doing
into that elevated
S-curve in Stanton.
The damage will
be 1 00 times worse.
Right. I'm just telling you.
the portable derailer
is worthless.
You got too much train
traveling entirely too fast.
Maybe 1 206 should just
stay on it as a backup.
Look. I am not
jeopardizing more personnel
and more property
just because some engineer
wants to play hero.
End of discussion!
That train is our property.
It's our decision!
Now you stop your pursuit
or I will fire you!
Fire.
You already did.
Already did what?
You've already fired me.
I received my 90-day notice
in the mail 72 days ago.
Forced early retirement.
half benefits.
So you're going to
risk your life for us
with three weeks left.
Not for you.
I'm not doing it for you.
Frank.
Let me see that thing.
Mr. Galvin.
this is Will Colson.
your conductor.
I'm letting you know.
we're going to
run this bitch down.
Maybe you didn't
hear what I just said.
Colson. I will fire you!
Well. that's too bad.
I was just starting
to like this job.
God damn it, you listen to me!
You son of a bitch!
You will be fired!
You're breaking up.
Sorry. you're...
This garbage is...
Sir. I think they're gone.
This is your
headache now. Hooper.
Now you get them
off the main or consider
yourself shit-canned. too!
I like them.
Bring up Beech Siding
to Arklow.
Take a look behind me,
you can see emergency
evacuation measures
are currently in effect
right here in the tiny town
of Arklow.
The lash-up was a no-go.
Connie. are you there? Over.
Frank. I'm real sorry
about Galvin.
That's okay.
Listen. Iisten. Is he off?
Yeah. he's gone.
Okay. Iisten up.
I'm going to need you
to do us a favor.
I need you to keep us
posted on the speed
and location of 777.
Location and speed.
Over.
Connie?
Frank. 777's
You got some
catching up to do.
What did you say
your wife's first name was?
Darcy.
So. what was the long story
you didn't want to make long?
I come home from
work two weeks ago
and she's
texting on the phone.
I ask her who with.
she says. ""Nobody.""
I say. ""Let me see
the phone."" She says no.
This goes on
five or six times.
Wait. you're losing me.
She's texting...
There's this guy
we both went to school with.
He's a cop.
he's a PA state trooper.
He's always had
a thing for Darcy.
Going way back.
CONNIE: 1206, where are you?.
We're just passing
milepost 5-7.
You're about a mile
and a half behind.
How far out of Arklow
is 777?
Seven and a half miles.
It picked up speed.
You better step on it.
I'm stepping on it.
in it. around it
and through it. Connie.
Thank you. Over.
She's texting on the phone.
I keep on asking for it.
she keeps on saying no.
She starts to walk
away and I grab for it.
You hit her?
No. no. no.
I mean. I scared her.
but I didn't hit her.
Anyway. I drive
to this guy's house
and tell him we need to talk.
Iet's take a ride.
He jumps in my truck
and starts in with.
""You got it all wrong.
We're just friends.""
Then he stops once he sees
the gun I got
sitting on the dash.
Oh!
I look him in the eye
and say. ""She's my wife.
You find a new friend.""
You pulled a gun on a cop?
CONNIE: Frank?.
Frank. 777 just
passed milepost 61.
Thank you. Connie.
You want to hear the kicker?
Yes. I do.
It wasn't even him
that was texting her.
It was my sister-in-law.
Anyway.
by the time I got home.
his buddy's waiting for me.
just waiting to serve me
with this restraining order.
Darcy wouldn't
even look at me.
So I'm living
with my brother.
There was a hearing today.
The judge ordered
a 30-day extension.
It's like one day
everything's going okay.
and the next. it's all
falling apart faster
than you can put
it back together.
Yeah.
Never too late. though.
FEMALE REPORTER:
The plan to derail
this 39-car runaway train
is just minutes away now.
There's a tremendous
amount of activity
going on.
Will this train be
able to be stopped?.
We're just passing
milepost 6-2.
Milepost 6-2, over.
Still a mile gap.
maybe more.
We're not
gaining on her. Frank.
Hold on.
It's just like
the shooting range!
All right. here we go!
Come on! Let's go!
This is it! It's game time!
Remember. we're aiming
for the red circular button!
Now!
Hold your fire!
You're shooting
the fuel cap. God damn it!
Hold your fire!
We were aiming to
disable it by firing
shotgun rounds
at a fuel stop safety switch,
and so some shots were fired.
FEMALE REPORTER:
That safety switch is
a mighty small target.
And it's right
next to a fuel tank.
We're not gonna
catch it before Arklow.
Frank.
you're closing the gap.
You should cut your speed.
Allow yourself some
stopping distance.
Just in case.
No can do. Connie.
If we slow down now.
we'll never catch it.
Not before Stanton. Over.
It's your call.
However,
we have now also learned
that two railroad employees
are now in
pursuit of train 777
in a single locomotive.
It is unclear
what their plan is...
WOMAN ON INTERCOM:
Connie Hooper for you.
Did I or did I not tell you
to get 1 206 off the main?
I asked them nicely.
You're 1 00%% sure that
derailer won't work?
Yes. 1 00%%%? No.
Which one is it?
Pretty funny.
And if it does?
If it does. then
we're a wreck on a wreck.
I'm here with FRA
official Gene Devereaux.
This train is getting close.
How is this going to work?.
Basically,
it works like a ramp.
The train comes along,
this piece here
will lift the flange
and pull it outside the rail.
That will cause
the train to flip over
on its right-hand side.
Son of a bitch won 't
even know what hit it.
FI REMAN : Train's about
four minutes out!
OFFICER: Guys. come on.
Get it started!
Guys. come on!
FEMALE REPORTER:
It has not succeeded!
What?
What in the hell was that?
That was 1 0 million pounds
of train. Mr. Galvin!
And this is the sound
of me saving your ass!
Frank. do you copy?
Frank?.
This is 1 206. Over.
You were right.
It barely bumped.
Jesus Christ.
We're bringing you
live coverage right now
on what could very well
result in one of the
worst disasters
in the history of
the state of Pennsylvania.
Now, the particulars
are still being examined,
but authorities
are far more focused
on the potential
destruction that would
result if train 777
were to derail in Stanton.
What'd you mean about
being married once?
Alice. my wife.
she died of cancer.
Four years ago.
I'm sorry.
Me. too.
Me. too.
Every night. I'd come home.
tell her about my day.
where I'd been.
what I hauled.
who annoyed me.
Guess I would have made
the evening report. huh?
Yes. you would have
made it. definitely.
You should call your wife.
I would.
but it's her day off.
She's probably sleeping.
Don't make excuses.
Wake her up.
Been calling for
the past two weeks.
She still hasn't
called me back.
She won't.
You got to call her.
Don't you know
how that works?
You quit too easy.
PAULINE: Darcy!
Darcy!
I have been
calling and calling.
What is wrong?
As we told you earlier today,
those emergency evacuations
began early this morning
as they try to move people
out of harm's way.
You get a sense of
the perimeter here.
You see the firefighters...
PAU LIN E: Hey. it's me.
Yeah. we're on our way.
Yeah. I know.
I'm watching it.
Two railroad employees
are presently in
pursuit of train 777
in a single locomotive.
No one seems exactly clear
on what their plans are
should they catch
up to that train.
It's Dad.
We have just learned
that railroad employee
Frank Barnes,
a 28-year veteran of
the freight company
responsible for the runaway,
and Will Colson, a conductor,
are now onboard
another locomotive.
We're on our way.
A single locomotive
trying to catch up
to the runaway train.
She's gotta get dressed.
And get this.
They were traveling...
I can tell.
She'll be ready
in a minute.
... at speeds of up
to 70 miles an hour
in reverse.
from the significantly...
Come on. Darcy. Iet's go.
Come on. get dressed.
...more populated
town of Stanton.
Let's go. boys!
Okay.
you're getting close.
The gap's at a mile
and 777 is 1 0 miles
to Stanton.
Now. Iisten.
Frank. I got a guy here
named Werner from the FRA.
Now. I'm inclined to defer
to your judgment here.
but he...
All right. Put him on.
We could use all
the help we can get.
Just press this
and hold to talk.
It's about slowing 777
once you've tied on.
I know
conventional wisdom says
to just gun it in
the opposite direction.
But you'll have
a better shot
alternating full throttle
with dynamic braking.
Yeah. but we can't afford
to lose counterthrust.
What you'll lose
in counterthrust
you'll compensate for
in tractive force.
Are you sure about that?
Well. it's more of a hunch
based on some
quick calculations.
It's a hunch.
I'm 70 miles an hour
and he's giving us a hunch.
Okay. Thank you.
Put Connie back on. please.
It's me, Frank.
Yeah. Connie.
does this guy know
what he's talking about?
In a perfect world.
yes. I'd say yes.
In a perfect world. okay.
We have more now on
that runaway freight train
in rural Pennsylvania.
They've devised
an ambitious plan
to bring it to a stop.
A single locomotive
moves in from behind,
catches up,
hooks up and then brakes
in an effort to slow it down.
Passing milepost 7 -6.
Connie. Over.
You're only
a half mile away.
Half a mile. Out.
Frank. running in reverse.
how are you gonna gauge
our gap distance?
I could go out there.
I could signal you by hand.
At 70 mile an hour?
I'm asking.
Would it help?
All right.
Radio and hand signals.
We'll combinate.
And be careful.
I will.
And take that
vest off. too.
Why?
Just take it off.
I don't want to
look out this window
and see you in
that yellow vest.
It'll freak me out.
Come on. Will.
Pick up. Come on.
ON VOICEMAIL: This is Will.
Leave me a message.
Damn!
Ten cars. Frank!
Affirmative. Over.
All right.
here she comes!
Three cars?
Three cars steady. Copy.
All right.
Steady, steady!
Two cars?
Yeah. two cars. Copy.
Steady. Over.
Keep it coming.
keep it coming!
Keep it coming!
Steady. steady!
MALE REPORTER: Will Colson
is trying to hook up 1206
with 777.
Oh. my God.
Something has gone
terribly wrong.
Will. what was that?
The grain car
blew a seal!
Are we tied off?
Will, what's going on?.
MALE REPORTER: Right now we
are looking at live pictures
of this rescue operation.
Are we tied off?
No. Frank. it didn't work.
Our knuckle closed!
Will. use hand signals!
Hand signals!
We tied on?.
We're good! We're good!
What?
Oh. shit.
Frank.
the pin didn't fall!
FRANK: Say again.
The what?
Will. are we tied on?
It's not gonna work.
The pin didn't fall.
What?
The pin didn't fall!
It's not locking!
All right. well. Iook.
Try and get down there.
see what you can do.
Be careful!
Be careful.
Will!
MALE REPORTER:
It's not slowing down.
It's gaining speed right now.
He's reaching down,
trying to couple...
Will. can you read me?
MALE REPORTER: He's gone!
Will Colson is down.
We do not see him.
Chopper 43,
can you zoom in?.
We do not see
the conductor, Colson.
Come on. baby.
Will. can you read me?
Will!
MALE REPORTER:
Chopper 43, zoom in.
There he is. Will Colson.
As he struggles
to pull himself up,
Iooks like Will Colson
is in trouble.
MALE REPORTER:
The train is coupled.
I'm now being told
that the connection
has been made.
It looks
as though this train
is now attached.
successfully attached
to 777.
But it looks like
Will Colson is injured.
You all right?
I'm great.
Hey. hey. don't touch that!
Don't touch that boot!
Here. just wrap it up
with this.
Wrap it real tight.
all around.
You okay?
I'm all right.
I'm all right.
MALE REPORTER: Barnes
and Colson have caught up
to the runaway train.
Darcy. come on. Come on.
But the train continues
to speed in excess of
heading to Stanton.
Connie. how far we got?
How far to Stanton?. Over.
You guys are doing great.
You're cutting
it close. though.
How's Will?.
He's...
He's different. Over.
Ready for
a little tug-of-war?
Let's do it.
Match our speed with theirs.
Frank. we're gonna
snap right off.
No. we're not. we're not.
We're just stretching.
that's all.
We're just stretching.
FEMALE REPORTER:
Here in Stanton,
the evacuation procedures
continue for the entire town.
This is the town where that
mainline train track turns
into an elevated curve.
They say there is
virtually no chance
this speeding,
out-of-control train
will make it
through that curve.
We should be slowing down.
Which we're not.
Shoot.
Go to the dynamic.
Alternate full throttle.
Christ! Those cab brakes
are getting a workout.
MALE REPORTER:...because
of the highly toxic nature
of the cargo.
Come on. Frank.
Come on. baby.
Ah!
What's our speed?
We're under 50.
Connie. how far away?
FRA's got men on the ground
ready to hop onboard
as soon as you
guys get it under 20.
All right. Tell them.
be ready to hop. Over.
Shoot!
What is it?
We're gaining speed.
Consist is too heavy.
We're being dragged.
Connie!
I'm here. Frank.
We're gonna be
coming in too hot.
Let them know.
The limit on
that curve is 1 5.
I don't know if you can
take it much faster.
maybe 20. 25. max?
We may not have a choice.
Just tell them it's
gonna be real hot.
What about the braking
on the freight cars?
Good. good.
All right. I'm on it.
Just sit down. No. no.
I've got it. Sit tight.
I'll go out. Sit down.
No. in fact. come here.
You sit here. I'll go out.
Just keep it at four.
You all right?
Take it easy.
Yeah.
Hold that dynamic
at a four.
Four.
Integrate it
with the throttle
if you have to.
Hold it at a four.
integrate the throttle.
Burn the block out.
it doesn't matter.
Hey. don't get
sentimental on me.
Makes me think I'm gonna die.
Just hold that four.
Come on. Frank.
MALE REPORTER:
AWVR officials
have no comment.
Barnes is attempting
to manually brake
the last car of 777.
He's actually running
on top of the grain cars
and jumping...
Way to go. Frank.
Let's go. Frank.
Looks like 777
is slowing down.
FEMALE REPORTER:
We understand
this is some sort of
an attempt to try
and stop the train.
Yes! Come on.
come on! You can do it!
Will. how fast you going?
All right.
we're dropping. 33.
MALE REPORTER:
The railroad spokesman
just confirmed he is...
Think it'll work?
...attempting to slow 777
by manually
braking each car.
Theoretically.
Provided that locomotive's
independent brake holds out.
We continue to
bring you live coverage
of this breaking news event
from the town of Stanton.
Emergency management officials
have created this perimeter.
ON LOU DSPEAKER:
This is the police.
Get off the roof.
You are being
asked to evacuate
for your own safety.
Shit!
Frank!

We're picking up
speed again.
Can you still slow it down?
We're almost at the curve.
Frank. our engine

have the muscle
to stop this thing.
We're creeping up fast.
All right. well.
just hang on to
the independent.
I'll tell you when.
Elevated and strictly Class 2,

Frank!
We're at... We're at 60.
and we're going to
hit 80 in no time!
He's not gonna make it.

Yes. it is. Will.
You can do this.

the speed of the pickup
with the train.
Do it. you pussy!
Jump in the back!

Blah. blah. blah.
Same here.
Felt pretty good. actually.
Yeah. it did. actually.
...bringing it to
a successful conclusion.
What was your first reaction
when you realized
what was happening?
I felt I was in
my comfort zone.
What'd they say
about your job?
They said it's mine
if I want to keep it.
They'd be stupid
not to give it to you.
Yeah.
That's what I told them.
Said they better think about
giving me a better one. too.
How about me?
How about you?
As you can see,
the result was a positive.
Ned...
Do we have
any better of an idea
as to how this happened?
NED: Well,
the thing that happened...
Thank you very much, Ned.
Everybody, this is Ned Oldham.
To answer that
last question...
Sorry. I wonder if
you can help me.
