\ No \
\ No \
\ No \
\ No \
\ No \
\ Sip the juice \
\ I got enough
to go around \
\ And the thought
takes place uptown \
\ I grew up
on a sidewalk \
\ Where I learned
street talk \
\ And then taught
to hawk New York \
\ I go to Queens for queens
to get the crew from Brooklyn \
\ Make money in Manhattan
and never been took in \
\ Go uptown to the Bronx
and boogie down \
\ Get strong on the island,
recoup and lay around \
\ Time to build
my juice back up \
\ Props stack up \
\ Suckers get smacked up \
\ Don't doubt
the clout \
\ You know
what I'm about \
\ Knockin' niggers off,
knockin' niggers out \
\ Shakin' 'em up,
wakin' 'em up \
\ Rakin' 'em up,
breakin' 'em up \
\ Standin' on shaky ground,
too close to the edge \
\ Let's see if I know
the ledge \
\ The corner's triflin',
'cause Shorty's here \
\ I get cocked liftin'
\ Here's a sip for
the crew that's deceased \
\ If I get revenge,
then they rest in peace \
\ Somebody gotta suffer \
\ I just might
spare one \
\ And give a brother
a fair one \
\ Stay alert and on pees \
\ And I do work
with these \
\ Like Hercules \
\ Switch to southpaw,
split your right jaw \
\ 'Cause I don't
like y'all \
\ I'm hype
when night fall smooth \
\ But I move
like an army \
\ Bulletproof down \
\ In case brothers
try to bomb me \
\ Puttin' brothers
to rest \
\ Like Eliot Ness \
\ 'Cause I don't like stress \
\ Streets ain't a place
for innocent bystanders to stand \
\ Nothin's gonna
stop the plan \
\ I'll chill like Pacino \
\ Kill like De Niro,
black Gambino \
\ Die like a hero \
\ Livin' on shaky ground \
\Too close to the edge \
\ Let's see
if I know the ledge \
\ Shells lay around
on the battle ground \
\ Dead bodies are found
throughout the town \
\ Try to put shame in my game
to make a name \
\ I'm gonna
put it on a bullet \
\ Put it in your brain \
\ And my pockets
are still fat \
\ Wherever I'm at,
I get the welcome mat \
\ So come say hi
to the bad guy \
\ Don't say goodbye \
\ I don't plan to die \
\ 'Cause I get loose \
\ And I got troops \
\ And crazy juice \\

Her boy Tyrone--
You know Tyrone,
that tall skinny boy?
Nice kid.
He's looking to get
into the Acme School,
that school
where they teach you
to fix cars, washing machines,
and whatnot.
You make good money
doing that.
Are you listening to me?
I'll give you $5.00,
Raheem.
Now, let me in.
Did you say $5.00?
Yes, I did.
Cool. $5.00.

And you're not going

Remember that.
Quincy, where's

What's up, Lenny, man?
Better hurry that ass up.
Mrs. Sanders ain't going

Yo, Raheem!
Yo, Raheem!
Keesha. Keesha, wait.
I don't want to argue.
I'm tired of that shit.
What the fuck

I could help.
That's my baby, too.
Ifwe got back
together...
I ain't even about
to let you have my baby
so you can have him
hangin' out with you
and your fucked-up friends.
And how would Charlene
feel about that?
I ain't messin'
with Charlene no more.
Raheem, you ain't even
foolin' nobody.
Everybody knows.
It's all over the school.
Come talk to me
when you're serious.
I'm serious now.
I'm serious, too,
Raheem!
This does not
make you a man.
I need a real man.
I'm not lettin' my child

Iike you and your
stupid-ass friends.
Yeah, well,
fuckyou, then!
I don't need
your tired ass anyway, bitch!
That was real smooth, man.
I'm squashin' her.

'cause I don't care
if he's crazy or not.
I'll stomp the shit

You ain't saying
nothing but a word!
He's just bullshittin'.
He didn't mean it.
Shit if I didn't mean it.
Fuck that little
Puerto Rican maricon!
Maricon? Maricon?
Ifyou're looking' for faggots,

Yeah, man.
She liked it, too.
My man,

Thankyou.
Appreciate it.
So how was it?
It was good.
What do you think?
I heard Donna Bromwell

The bitch tried to fuck me
on the stove.
She still got that,

No, man. I wasn't lookin'

I was doin' the hootchy-kootchy,
my friend.
You knew it was Donna
from that hair on her face.
Yeah, man, come on.

'Reckin' crew!
Hope you're feelin'

What's happenin'?
You got that
party tape for me?
Yeah, I got the shit.

Hit the button!
Hit the button!
Pow!
Kiss? Money?

Do you hit
Brenda's skins?

Snappy-nappy

nickel-and-dime bullshit.
Yo, DJ Plaz,
DJ Rich E. Rich,
Pete Rock, and DJ Scratch

So what?
They won both contests
last year.
That was the Hott Boxx.
Anybody could have won

This is the Ruffhouse.
The comp will be serious.

Ah, thankyou.
Yo, Blizzard is in there

stickin' the place up.
Word, right now?
He let you out?
He asked me if I wanted
a piece of the action.
You said no?
What are you, crazy?
I don't think so.
Let me tell you

That crazy motherfucker

I'm too hungry

But I only did it
foryou, Ed.
Cody still ain't

Oh, shit!
Shot his moms in the back.
Yo, Steel. Let me borrow

You see me watching TV.
Heh heh heh!
Made it, Ma!
Made it, Ma!
Top of the world!
Top of the world!
Yo!
Ifyou gotta go out,
that's how you go out.
That motherfucker took
his destiny in his own hands.
Mmm, some destiny.
What you know about it,
Big Chops?
What you ever control?
I control my life.
That's bullshit.
I got more control
overyour life than you do.
How you figure that?
I'm lettin' you breathe,
ain't I?
You can't even
walkyour own block
without getting fucked up
by Radames, let's not forget.
Ha ha ha.
Oh, shit!
It's Blizzard!
A gunman was killed
in a shoot-out with police
as he attempted to rob
the Harlemwood bar
just under an hour ago.
The gunman,
identified as 20-year-old
Barnett Jerkins,
wounded two officers before
he himself was killed.
On the news at 7:00,
we'll have more on this story
as well as an update
on the campaign...
Y o, man, we were
just down there.
To have the already
financially strapped city
provide more
police protection
on the subway els
after dark.
What the fuck are you doing, man?
Come here!
Fuckin' Radames.
We ain't shit.
Man, what's your problem?
You're my fuckin' problem!
People sweat us
on the street,
and you don't even
give a fuck.
I thinkyou're
exaggerating.
That's bullshit, man!
We run from the cops,
we run from Radames,
we run from
security guards,
we run from Old Man Quiles
and his bullshit store
when he come
with that bullshit gun.
All we do
is fuckin' run!
I feel like I'm on
the god damn track team.
I'm serious!
What's the matter,
Raheem?
Nothin' to say?
That's 'cause
you know I'm right.
In your heart,
you know I'm right.
Yo, big man! Ifyou want
respect, you gotta earn it.
You damn right!
You gotta be ready
to go down,
stand up,
and die like Blizzard did
ifyou want some juice.
Blizzard? Blizzard ain't
stickin' up to nothin' now.
That's 'cause we wasn't there
to back him up!
Ifwe was there--
There'd be five dead niggers
instead of one!
You ain't sayin' nothin' now,
right, big man?
I never thought
I'd see the day
when you'd
talk like a punk.
Fuckyou, man!
Yo, chill!
Fuck chill!
Checkyourself, Q.
You gotta
snatch some collars
and let them
motherfuckers know
you're there
to take them out
anytime you
feel like it.
You gotta get the ground
beneath your feet,
get the wind
behind your back,
and go out in a blaze.
Otherwise
you ain't shit.
You might as well be dead
your damn yourself.
You tryin' to tell me
I ain't shit?
I ain't tryin'
to tell you shit.
I'll tell your mama
you ain't shit.
Yo, man, what
are we fightin' for?
I don't know, nigger.
You ready to die?
You're fucked up, man.
Don't turn your fuckin'
back on me, nigger!
You broke
the fuckin' vase, man!
What the fuck

Damn, man!
What the fuck?
Messin' up my shit, man!
Feed y'all!
Sorry, man. Here!
Fuck that money, man!
Look at that shit!
I got to tell
my parents--
Shut the fuck up!
All right, that's it!
That's it!
Bishop, I want you and Q
to settle this shit
right now!
Come on, y'all.
You're like brothers.
Fuck that.
You are brothers!
Fuck that.
We used to be like brothers.
All right,
we're going to squash it.
What do you say?
Bishop?
Yeah, it's cool.
All right.
I'm not makin' sense!
You're not makin' sense!
You know why?
What?
Uh, how you doin'?

Um, Frank, Q.
Q, Frank.
How you doin'?
Q.
What, did names like
Mustafah and Akbar
become too hard
to spell?
My real name is Quincy,

of that name,
so people call me Q
or GQ, you know,
Iike a nickname,
abbreviation.
Well, uh, Quincy,

hubcaps or something like that?
Asshole.
Excuse me? Speak up.
I can't hearyou, boy.
O.K., Frank, I found it.
Remember these?
Ha ha ha.
What the hell are you laughing at,
you chain snatcher?
Look, who is this kid,
and what is he
doing here?
Frank, don't you think
it's a little late
to try acting
like a husband now?
You're taking this
save-the-children shit too far.
Bye.
Just telling you
foryour own good.
Bye, Frank.
I can't express
concern, what?
So that's him, huh?
That's him.
You know, he got a real
attitude problem.
Definitely.
Mmm, baby.
You're sweatin' already.

Is that your spot?
Yeah. You know

\ Don't worry, baby \
Wish I could
spend the night,

That would be nice.
Sleep all day.
I could make you
breakfast in bed.
That'd be dope. That'd

I...I thinkyou'd better let me

Mm-hmm.
You can cook, all right.

at the ball court.
When is it?
Tomorrow mornin'.
I can't make it, man.
What do you mean,
you can't make it?
I got a real important
appointment.
Well, how important is it?
It's my deejay audition.
Oh, man.
All right, Q.
I'm going to
straighten this out
with the rest
of the boys,
but make sure you
get there afteryou're done.
This is
serious business,
so we're gonna
wait foryou.
That's cool.
Why don't you tell me
what it is now,
get it over with?
Later.
By the way,
good luck, man.
Smooth.
What do you mean,
it ain't good enough?
What do you mean,
it ain't good enough?
My name is Flex.
Look, this brother
look like Gumby.
What you talkin' about,
I ain't good enough?
I mean exactly
what I said.
You need
more experience.
You need to work
on your mixing more.
My--my--
what you mean?
What the fuck's
wrong with my mix?
I know you didn't
snatch that from me.
What's wrong
with my mix?
Look, the shit
is totally sloppy.
Only a fool would
open up like you.
Nobody likes
the records you play.
It's completely
whacked--face it!
Face it.
Fuckyou!
You might have a chance
if that shit
wasn't so small.
Next!
You ever deejay before?
Yeah, you know,
run away, make tapes
for my boys, stuff like that.
You know what I'm sayin'?
Yeah, you local.
I really
liked your tape.
Thankyou.
I'll see you
Saturday night.
What is your name?
GQ.
GQ.
Come on.
Yes!
You know, I think
you and me can be closer
than two craps
together coming out--
What's happen, Trip?
Yo, yo, my brother.
Heard you made that deejay comp.
Congratulations.
GQ, you know
what I'm sayin'?
All right.
What's up, man?
I made that deejay contest
Saturday night.
Once again, it's on.
What you talkin' about?
It's on.
What's this nigger
talkin' about now?
Stickin' up Old Man Quiles
Saturday night.
What? Man, you better
stop bullshittin' me.
I ain't bullshittin' you.
What, is you scared?
Steel ain't scared,
are you, Steel?
Here come Raheem.
Yo, what's up, Q?.
What's up, man?
Chillin'.
You got it?
Yeah, I got it.
Come on, let's walk.
What's goin' on
with this garbage?
Check this out.
Oh, shit!
This shit is sweet.
I got it from Sweets.
I ain't never
shot nobody before.
Yo, be careful with that.
It's loaded.
Quiles is not
gonna draw on somebody
that got a gun on him.
It's gonna be
a piece of cake.
A piece of cake.
We go in
right before 1 1 :00,
get the loot, and jet.
The whole thing won't take longer
than three fuckin' minutes.
You decided it
this morning without me?
Yeah. While you was at
your, uh, appointment.
Check this here, man.
I got to deejay
Saturday night.
I'm not missin' that.
Guess you got to
disappoint them.
I ain't disappointin' shit.
Maybe not.
There's going to be
a lot of deejays there, right?
Yeah.
How do they pick
who goes when?
There's 40 deejays,
all I know is
I go seventh.
We're going to
need an alibi.
Since you're
going seventh,
that'll give us
an opportunity to go in,
do what we got to do,
and jet.
Get the fuck
out of there.
I think that'll work.
What about the cops?
Bishop checked it out.
There's two
overlappin' patrols
about three minutes apart.
We got to be fast.
Yo, I think we should
plan this another time.
This nigger's scared!
I have to deejay
Saturday night.
Fuck that shit!
We're goin' Saturday night,
and that's it.
I'll hold onto the gun.
Why him?
'Cause I already got it,
motherfucker!
Just let him
hold the gun.
The nigger be
acting stupid.
Shut up!
Suck my dick.
What time you
gotta be there?
Before 9:00.
We'll pick up your shit,
go over there,
set you up--
You'll be straight, man.

You didn't have to!
He made a move.
He didn't make
no fuckin' move!
You're lyin'!
I was lookin'
right at you!
Yo, man.
He's dead, isn't he?
What we going to do?
He knew who we was!
Fat boy says your name.
He knew who we was!
Everybody just shut up!
Yo, man!
Fuck! What we going to do now?
We gots to get rid

Yeah, you're right, man.
Bishop,

I'm not playin' here.
Oh, really?
Stop this shit, man!
You stop it, man!
Yo, stop!
Oh, shit!
Hey!

Don't go fuckin'

Wipe that shit.
Come on.
Look, if I go down,

Those motherfuckers
don't give a fuck
who shot who.
Come on.
Raheem!
Damn.
I warned him.
You saw that!
I told him, man.
He had no business
grabbin' the gun.
But it was Raheem!
I don't give a fuck!
Nobody's supposed
to do that shit.
If anybody
got a problem,
we can deal with it
right now.
You got a problem
with it?
I'm warning you, Q.
We got to get the fuck
back to the club.
Um...
if anybody asks
about Raheem,
we don't know.
We ain't seen him.
You can't fuckin' keep up
with a man at a party.
So...
Um...
Come on.
Come on!
Let's go.
Come on!
Let's go.
Let's go.
Good luck.
Fuck that!
You are brothers.
Piece of cake, Q.
Round 2!
Once again,
we have deejay,
that fly-guy,
GQ!
And from Detroit,
DJ Plaz!
Hey!
Hey! Get down here!
Get down here.
Keep your mouth shut!
Raheem is dead.
Somebody shot him.
Hey! Sit back
and be cool.
I'm Detective Markham.
This is Detective Kelly.
We want to askyou boys
some questions.
Let's go.
Let's open it up
right now!
Break away!
Move it!
When was the last time
you saw Raheem Porter
breathin'?
Tonight at the club.
What time?
An hour
before Qset up.
Where did he go
afteryou last saw him?
I have no idea--
Why'd he leave?
I don't know.
I thought
he was checkin' out.
He was talkin'
to a girl,
clockin' the 'ho's.
Clockin' the 'ho's?
Clockin' the 'ho's?
Did you leave
the club tonight?
I went to the basement.
What for?
I ran into
an old girlfriend.
What were you doing
down in the basement?
Do you know
Fernando Quiles?
Yes.
You got popped for boostin'
in Quiles' store.
Yes or no?
Well, I--
Yes or no?
Yes.
Mr. Quiles was regularly
harassed by local gangs.
Do you have any rivalry
with other gangs?
Puerto Rican gang,
Rapido Muerte.
We know who they are.
Radames. They always
fuckin' with us.
Radames.
Tell us about Radames.
Puerto Rican gang.
They think they rule
the fuckin' world.
Didn't your gang
regularly harass Mr. Quiles?
No. 'Cause
we're not a gang.
Yeah. We didn't
kill him, though.
We didn't say
you killed him.
We said you regularly
harassed Mr. Quiles!
How about Porter?
Did they harass him, too?
If anybody had a motive
to do Raheem in,
it would have
been Radames.
Q got loud on you.
They screamed on you.
We just want to get
the full confession.
We want to get
the story from you.
When it goes down,
I can talk to the D.A.
Everything's
going to be cool.
I didn't do nothing.
They say
you was the cap man
who blew Raheem away.
Who the fuck
killed Porter?
Who killed him?
I don't know, man!
I don't know.
Why do you seem
so nervous?
What are you
nervous about?
We're three niggers
in a police station.
It doesn't matter
what happened.
Ify'all want us
to be guilty,
we'll be guilty.
Ifyou didn't
do nothing,
you got nothing
to worry about.
\ Oh \
\ Amazing \
\ Ah \
\ Grace \
\ How \
\ Sweet \
\The sound \
Quincy, please
eat something.
I don't feel like
eating right now, Mama.
I know,
but just try, O.K.?
Just try for me.
Come on.
O.K.
\ A poor wretch like... \
\ Me \
\ I... \
Yo, man.
I'm scared.
You scared?
\ Was lost \
\ But now \
\ I'm found \
\ Was blind... \\
You don't have
to be doing this.
Sit down.
I got this, Myra.
Be with the people.
It's O.K.
I'm O.K.
How you doing,
Mrs. Porter?
I'm O.K.
Can I help you?
Help me.
Bring in the corn bread.
This one?
Yes.
What's up, Myra?
Q!
I haven't seen you
in a long time.
Sorry it had
to be like this.
How you doing?
Under the circumstances,
I'm all right.
I got to stay strong
for Ma, though.
She's trying to deal with this
by keeping busy,
and she keeps going
and going nonstop.
I don't think
she's cried yet or...
Hey, Roland.
How you doing?
I should be
asking you that.
We're staying strong.
I'd feel better
if I knew the police
had somebody, you know.
They, uh...
they say there
was no witnesses,
and they don't
have any leads or...
I don't know.
We been askin' around, too.
Nobody's seemed to have
seen or heard anything.
We'll find
those motherfuckers,
the police ain't going
to have to do shit.
Eric, put them here.
Uh, Myra?
Yes, Ma.
I've got to take
care of that.
Excuse me.
You remember me,
Mrs. Porter,
Roland Bishop?
Yes, Roland.
Thanks for coming.
You don't have
to thank me.
Raheem was one
of my best friends.
It's nice to see
people come together
when something bad happens.
Personally, for me, though,
Raheem was like my brother.
I mean, he was
more than a brother.
I mean, we did
everything together,
just kickin' it every day.
If there's
anything I can do,
just let me know.
Who is it?
Hey, Q.
Come on in, man.
I heard about Raheem.
I really liked Raheem.
Did somebody shoot him?
Yeah.
Do you know who?
No, man.
Heard you got arrested.
What? Where'd
you hear that?
From Ishmal.
Who?
Ishmal, from
the second floor.
And Wendy,
Clarence, and Rashid.
No, man. I didn't
get arrested.
Hey, Q!
Oww!
Shut up!
Yo, Q!
Hey, Q!
Motherfucker,
you hurt my arm.
What'd you call me?
You heard me!
I told you about
that word, all right?
You got to learn
not to use
that language, man.
Come here, man.
Sit up.
Yo, B, man,
do me a favor.
What?
If Bishop comes by,
tell him I ain't here.
Don't you like Bishop?
Why you ask
so many questions?
'Cause I like Bishop!
Why?
He's cool.
He's cool, huh?
Tell Mr. Coolman,
if he comes by, I ain't here.
What's in it for me?
You get to keep your
own teeth, that's what.
That's no good.
I'm losin' my teeth anyway.
I can't believe this, man.
I'm getting blackmailed
by my own baby brother?
I tell you what.
You like that radio?
Yeah.
It's dope.
Right.
Go ahead.
You can have it.
Really?
You do what I tell you.
Fine by me.
Go ahead. It's yours.
What do you say, man?
Thankyou.
Damn, man.
Has it been that long?
You want to try it again
outside after school, punk?
What's up?
I ain't seen you
in a couple days.
What's been happenin'?
Man, get off that shit.
It's over!
There ain't nothin'
nobody can do about it now.
What do you want
from me, man?
Nothin'!
Just came to see
ifyou was all right,
see how you been doin'.
Well, I ain't--
I ain't talked to
nobody, all right?
I know. We crew.
Always will be.
I just came to see
what's up.
Let me tell you somethin', B.
I'm only playin'
your fuckin' game
'cause there ain't
shit else to do.
But don't you ever
pull a gun on me again.
I hope I won't have to.
We all go down ifyou do,
'cause we all crew.
Just try me ifyou think
I'm bullshittin'!
Excuse me.
Look at this!
The brother finally decides
to stand up like a man
and throw down.
Too bad Raheem had
to die first, huh?
It's over.
Everything starts from now.
We all go down
unless we stay together.
Ain't no one man above the crew.
You know that shit.
You're crazy, man.
You know what?
When you said that last time,
I was kind of trippin', right?
But now...
you right.
I am crazy.
But you know what else?
I don't give a fuck.
I don't give a fuck
about you,
I don't give a fuck
about Steel,
and I don't give a fuck
about Raheem, either.
I don't give a fuck
about myself.
Look, I ain't shit.
I ain't never
gonna be shit.
And you less
of a man than me,
so soon as I decide
you ain't gonna be shit,
pow.
So be it.
You remember that,
motherfucker,
'cause I'm the one y'all
need to be worried about...
partner.
Baby, can I get you--
Don't do that!
Sorry.
Don't scare me like that.
Watch that shit.
I said I'm sorry.
Didn't your mama teach you
to make yourself known
before entering
a fuckin' room?
Watch your mouth
in my house.
Fuckyou.
I am not one ofyour
high school playmates,
and ifyou cannot
respect me in my house,
then get out
of my house.
Go on! Out!
Come on, nigger.
I got what you need.
Well, well...
Iookee here.
Get the fuck
out of here!
I want to talk
to your sorry ass outside.
Yo, man.
I think Bishop's
lost it, man.
So what else is new, man?
I mean seriously, man.
He was talkin'
some way-out shit,
about how he got more juice than
everybody else on the street,
that everybody learn
not to fuck with him,
or else they end up
like Raheem and Quiles.
He say that shit
in front of people?
No, only to me,
but he meant it, man.
I could see it
in his face.
Somethin's gonna happen.
I feel it.
Yo!
Get the fuck off me!
What's the idea
of tellin' the cops
I killed Raheem?
But I didn't tell
the cops a damn thing.
Don't give me
that shit, man.
They brought me in
for questioning.
And they said
you said...
I did it.
I didn't tell 'em shit!
You got it wrong.
Now, punk, you the one
that got it wrong.
You been askin'
for an ass-kickin'
for a long time.
Raheem ain't here
to protect you no more.
Ha ha ha!
I don't need Raheem or nobody
for no fuckin' punk spic!
What the--
He's fuckin' suicidal.
Ever seen...
Chinatown...

I must've missed it!
Oh, shit!
Get him, man!
Yo, man, you think
he saw us?
Yeah.
What you think
he gonna do?
I think we lost 'em.
Riverside, motherfucker.
I'm here to see Sweets.
\ There's got to be
a reason \
\ And we know
the reason why \
\ You try to put on
those airs \
\ And act real cool\
\ But you got to
realize \
\ That you're acting
like fools \
\ Ifthere's music,

Ha ha ha!
Uh, excuse me.
Sweets?
Do I know you?
No. Um...

Come on, come on,
I don't have all night.
I need some protection.
How much we talkin' about?

Yes.
Tell your mother

You thinkin' about Raheem?
I know who killed him.
What?
I know who killed Raheem.
Who?
I can't tell you that,
Yolanda.
Did you tell the police?
Hell, no, I ain't

You're mixed up in it.
I didn't kill him,
ifthat's what you're thinkin'.
What areyou

I don't know.
You don't know?
Excuse me, I thought

Yes?
Oh, hold on.
It's Steel.
What up?
Q, man, I'm at the pool hall

See how scared you are?
Don't you get tired

What the fuck

Nothin'.
I'm an ordinary

Excuse us for a minute.

What's up, Trip?
Lookin' for that P-funk.
You seen Qaround?
Mm-mmm. Somethin'

He ain't been actin'

I mean, it kinda hurtin'
because we been best friends
since we was in the second grade!
Did you know that?
I try to talk to him.
He don't even hear me.
He gone.
I mean, I can
look out for myself,
but...
Man, I don't know what
he might do to Steel,
the way he been

Q my man and everything,
but, uh...
I'll do him in
if I have to.
Word up.
Who is it?
Hello, Mrs. Thurman,

Damn! Thanks a lot,
Mrs. Thurman.
Shit!
Hey! I want to

Check down the hill.
Thought you'd be lookin'
