for the final quarter
of the N.B.A. finals...
The lighter terrain here...
- Hey, Millie.
- Oh, hey, David.
You got a lot of cities there.
See you later.
Hey, Millie.
Give me a sec.
Hey.
I wanted to give you this.
I picked it up at a
yard sale in Plymouth.
I-I thought you'd really like it.
It's a little dinged up
and it's missing a few steps, but...
I love it.
- You do?
- I do.
- Mark.
- Hey, what's this?
- Christmas come early?
- Mark, stop it.
- Mark, give it back to her.
Look what David got Millie!
You guys like the Eiffel Tower?
Wow, if you shake this
thing hard enough,
you can hear the Eiffel Tower move.
- Hey, who wants to give it a shake?
- Okay, that's enough!
- Stop it. Just give it back.
- All right.
Okay, I'm sorry.
Here.
Sorry, buddy.
Guess I don't know my own strength.
- I can't believe you're such a jerk!
- I was just playing around.
They thought
it was pretty funny.
David, don't go out there.
It's not safe.
David, just forget about it.
Come on, Rice Bowl!
Don't be stupid!
David, come back. Come on.
Just let it go. It's okay!
Come on, David!
- All good. See?
- David!
- Millie, don't go out there!
-
- David... Get help!
- Millie, get back here!
- You can't help him!
And that's how it
happened the first time.
One second I'm a goner,
and the next thing
I know I'm at the Ann
Arbor Public Library.
You know, when I ask a question,
I expect an answer. Okay?
Hey, hey, hey.
What happened to you?
Just kids at school.
Hey, David, get back down here,
get a mop and clean this crap up!
- David! David.
Open the door.
Did I just teleport?
Great.
I teleported to the library.
Look... No, no, no.
I'm not going anywhere.
You're okay.
David?
David?
I mean, who would have
believed me anyway?
Uh, I'd like a room.
You're not gonna be any trouble,
are you? No weird stuff?
Nope.
No weird stuff.
Been there.
If we're lucky,
maybe we'll see King Kong.
- Really?
-
- You got me?
- Oh, I got you. I'm not letting you go.
Is there a bathroom for customers?
Hey.
It's this way.
Yeah.
Make it quick.
No problem.
Thanks.
I'm gonna need a bigger bag.
Holy shit.
Whoo!
- Hey!
I said no weird stuff.
Let's go... two days'
rent. You owe me rent.
- Hello? Hello?
The police and the F.B.I.
Have already been through here.
- Who are you with?
- N.S.A.
The vault has a time lock,
pressure mounts, steel plates.
- This guy didn't open a door.
- Open a door?
We didn't know we were robbed
until halfway through the day.
I want the security tapes
for the whole month.
And I need the name of everyone who has
a safety deposit box in that vault.
That's confidential.
Why do you need those names?
Whoever robbed your vault
has been in it before.
Now, I want those names,
and I want those tapes.
Today.
# I saw a signpost tellin'me
to pick my feet...
She floats into the river.
But as you can see, this flood became
more severe about 10 minutes ago.
The question now, Pat, is,
what will happen to these people?
- How they doin'?
- Down by six at the half.
Don't think you'll be
needing that umbrella.
You never know.
-
- What are you drinking?
Gin and tonic.
Uh, Tanqueray and tonic.
Two of'em, please.
So, you live in London?
- Taxi!
Shit.
Dude, this totally sucks.
Hey, I thought this was where the storm
was supposed to hit.
- I heard it hit Fiji.
- Fiji, huh?
Yeah. They got,
like, 30-foot swells.
Really?
Wh... Whoa!
Let's go.
Because you are an abomination.
-
Only God should have the power...
to be all places at all times.
One less of you to worry about.
Cut him down!
Let's get the hell out of here.
- Yeah?
We have a lead on the bank, sir.
I'll be on the next plane.
Hey, Angelo.
How'd they do?
- Not so good.
- Ah.
- Told you you wouldn't
be needing that umbrella.
Yeah. You were right.
#
#
Eight years
we've been looking for you.
And who are you?
My name's Roland.
- What are you doing in my apartment?
- Oh, we'll get to that.
What kind of crook...
leaves a note?
- I think I need to talk to my lawyers.
You're not under arrest.
- You mean you're not the...
- Police? Mm-mmm.
Anybody can rob a bank.
What I'd like to know is
how you rob a bank...
without opening any doors.
Look, uh,
if you're not the police...
and I'm not under arrest...
I think I'd like you to leave.
-
- You need some help with that?
Been a while
since you used a door, huh?
Oh, I know who you are.
This conversation's over...
This conversation's not over...
until you answer my question!
Tell me, how'd you
last this long? Huh?
Jumpers.
electricity passing
through your brain, huh?
Perfect!
Who's protecting you?
Give me an answer so I can go home.
I hateJumpers.
-
-
You think you could
go on like this forever...
There are always consequences.
Where you goin', huh?
I've got you now.
-
-
-  Currently 66 degrees in...
-
David? David!
David! David!
Don't go!
Don't go. Just... Just...
Just hear me out.
Okay?
David...
I-I don't know if
I'm going crazy here or not.
I don't know a lot of things these days,
but if you can hear me...
Just wait, David! Don't go!
I gotta talk to ya!
David, if you can hear me, Son...
it's okay.
You can come home...
You're not crazy.
- Telecommunications.
- This is Roland.
He got away.
We have his jump sites.
Everybody.
Who is this?
May I help you?
Yeah, uh...
Hi, Mrs. Harris.
It's me, David.
David?
David Rice?
Millie was right.
You're not...
Dead. Yeah.
No, I'm not.
Actually, I was hoping
you could tell me where to find Millie.
Millie. She's got her own place
over on Morton.
Number 260.
- She's still here?
- Yeah, uh-huh.
She works at Houlihan's Bar
down by the campus.
Okay, you saw her.
Holy crap!
Rice Bowl?
Mark!
Mark Kobold!
Sorry, man.
I don't know you.
Jesus Christ!
Am I seeing a ghost?
Is this some kind of
sixth-sense shit?
I don't know what you're
talking about. Okay?
Hey! Everybody!
It's Rice Bowl!
Come on, don't you wanna grab a beer
with an old buddy from high school?
- I'm not this David...
Yo, it's the Rice Cake.
-
- Millie?
- Hi!
You were gonna leave
without saying anything?
Uh...
- Sorry. I didn't see you.
- No?
Weren't you just up there
staring at me for the past 45 minutes?
Yeah, David.
Why didn't you say somethin'?
- I think you're drunk.
- I'm not drunk. Okay? I'm cool.
I am totally, 110% cool.
Yeah, that was really
cool. Why don't you...
go find a bench and sleep it off. Okay?
A little splash of that.
-
- Hey! No!
- Come on.
-
- Mark!
Rice Bowl goes down!
Whoo!
- Whoo!
-
Wh-What did you do to me?
Freak!
Guess I don't know my own strength.
-
-
Hey, wh...
-  Hey. Are you okay?
- Hey.
Yeah.
Where's Mark?
- He took off.
- What?
Yeah, I don't think, uh, he's gonna
come back anytime soon.
Oh.
Bleeding a little.
We should take care of that.
Come on.
So, you saw me as soon as I came in?
Maybe.
I didn't know what to say.
How about, "Hi. Hello.
Been a long time. How are you?"
- Hi.
- Hello.
- Been a long time. How are you?
- I'm good.
How are you?
Why don't we skip this boring stuff?
You know, I didn't think,
uh, you'd still be here.
Where else would I be?
You had those lists, right?
And you were gonna
go travel the world and...
Things change.
We all need to grow up, right?
So what do you do?
Banking.
I'm in banking.
In banking?
How'd you get into that?
It's pretty easy, actually.
I just sort of landed in it.
Didn't you flunk algebra?
No.
- Fiona, I'm gonna take my break now.
- Yeah, sure. You bet.
-  So, you're back.
What now?
What's your plan?
Maybe gonna do some traveling.
I was thinking of maybe
checking out Rome, actually.
You were thinking
of checking out Rome?
You know that was my dream.
Don't try to rip me off. Okay?
- So come with me.
- So come with you?
- You're asking me to go to Rome?
- Mm-hmm.
I mean, only if you want to
skip the boring parts.
I got it.
I'll take it!
- As you like.
Yeah, yeah.
Can you believe just 10 hours ago
we were in Ann Arbor?
Yeah.
I'm afraid that's classified.
Really?
Well, then I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to see a federal warrant.
'Cause I don't believe you are
who you say you are.
Certainly.
Great.
Another cop.
So, Mark, tell me
what happened at the bank.
I told them already.
You're just another suit.
You're never gonna believe me.
It says here you were
beamed into the vault.
You wanna laugh about it?
Go ahead. Have a laugh.
You hear me laughing?
The girl's name is Millie Harris.
She boarded a plane
to Rome 16 hours ago,
and she didn't go alone.
I think there's something
you're not telling me.
What do you mean?
This room.
First class.
it's because they are.
- I told you, I'm in banki...
- Banking?
that you flunked algebra.
But just don't lie to me.
I'm not lying to you.
No?
Good.
Can't... reach it.
-
I could eat.
- You know, you could've just
asked me out on a date.
- You know, this has always been
number one on my list.
I know.
You must be pretty good
at this, huh?
Good at what?
- Rookie.
- No idea.
- W-W-W-W-Wait!
- Sorry, sir.
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.
No. No. It's impossible.
What?
- It's closed.
What do you mean, it's
closed? How is it closed?
- We just wanna go inside there.
- No, it's impossible. No, no.
- It's the Colosseum. How is it closed?
- It's impossible.
David, it's okay. I got
to see it from outside.
- You know, she came all
this way to go inside.
Hey, come on.
Sorry, he's... I don't know.
- Bye.
- What?
Come on.
How about a private tour?
It's closed. We can't
break into the Colosseum.
Who said it's closed?
The door was open.
Wanna see the Colosseum or not?
Come on.
We so should not be doing this.
You've gotta admit,
it's worth the risk.
Yeah.
-  It's so cool!
- It is.
Down here is where they used to keep
the gladiators and the lions in cages?
- We should go down there.
- Can't go down there. It's off-limits.
- Even when it's open.
- Nothing's off-limits.
What?
-
Psst! Millie!
Did that door just open too?
- It's open now.
- Yeah.
You're gonna want to see this.
Trust me.
Uh-oh.
I think he's telling you
do not enter.
You speak Italian?
No.
- Uh-huh?
Means "come on in."
Oh! I thought it meant "bullshit."
Well, no, that means that you should
stay here while I go around...
and open it from the other side.
It's all right.
You'll catch on.
Mmm.
Thank you very much.
Next showing will be at 6:00.
Don't forget to tip your usher.
- Uh, do you mind, man?
- Whoa!
- Just a little privacy, eh?
- Sorry, man.
This isn't a fashion show.
I'm taking a piss. Do you mind?
Place is all yours.
Wouldn't open that door if I were you,
not if I wanted my girlfriend
to keep breathing.
Bring her down, have a
nice, romantic picnic?
Nice little tea party?
Is that what you think is gonna happen?
- If you so much as look at her wrong...
- You gonna jump me? Where?
Did you think you were the only one?
You really have no idea, do you?
You lead the life you live.
Just jump
all over the place...
jump, jump, jump,
jump, jump, jump...
and nothing's gonna happen?
Well, they've noticed.
Not me.
I mean I already knew.
I'm not talking about me, but them.
Down there.
Hello, boys.
Just me, then.
-
- Huh. That's new.
Welcome to the war.
Just let me know if you guys
are gettin' tired.
- Close.
- David?
-
- What's going on?
Great. Let's meet
the girlfriend, shall we?
No.
-
- Who are these people?
Paladins.
Paladins killJumpers.
I kill Paladins.
Class dismissed.
- Uh-oh.
Wait!
I just came through your jump scar.
What do you think
you're doing here? Huh?
If I were you, I'd jump right back.
You're not supposed to see
all this stuff. Get out!
So if you'd like to
kindly fuck off, as in now.
Maybe your girlfriend's still alive.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- What happened to you?
- Uh, nothing.
Let's go. Come on.
I think we should just get out of here.
You were right. Okay? I shouldn't have
gone down there. Everything's fine.
Come on. We can
still make the museum.
Must be a cab around here somewhere.
Why aren't you talking to me?
Please talk to me.
- I'll tell you everything
back at the hotel. Okay?
I'm not waiting for the hotel.
- Look, Millie, it's,
uh... it's all fine. Okay?
No, it's not all fine.
- I wasn't supposed to go back there.
-
- Huh?
-
- No, I think you guys made a mistake.
- Be quiet.
You're looking for that guy over there.
-
- I'm sorry. I know I wasn't
supposed to be back there.
Can't you just let us
off with a warning...
Whoa! Okay, okay.
-
- Okay, okay, okay.
- Millie, just go back
to the hotel. Okay?
No...
- I'm with him!
I don't know her.
Millie, go back to the hotel.
- No. No.
-
I told you.
I want to see Millie.
- Where is the body?
- I didn't do anything, okay?
I-I don't know how many times
you want me to tell you the same thing.
Do you know how much longer
he's gonna be back there?
Yeah. I know. We've been waiting for
I don't speak your...
I don't know what you're saying.
Now you "seat," or we seat you.
- Okay.
- Seat!
I seat.
-  She's got
nothing to do with this.
We will hold on to your passport.
Hello, David.
they come through that
door. You understand?
You have to get out of here.
- Ditch the girl. If she's
with you, she's dead.
- Mom.
- Twenty seconds, David.
Mom! Mom!
Hey!
-
Millie.
All done. You okay?
Mm-hmm. Hey.
- I'm free to walk.
- They just let you go?
- They just let me go.
- Just like that?
Just like that.
Come on.
If they just let you go,
why are we running?
Well, uh, they really strongly suggested
that we leave town now.
- But what did they say to you?
- Asked me some questions.
- For eight hours?
- They had a lot of questions.
I really want to trust you.
You're making it extremely difficult.
All right. So trust me.
Let's go.
Whoa!
Whoa! Hey.
- Can you take us? Yeah?
Get in the cab, Millie.
Millie, get in the car.
Please.
Please get in the cab.
Remember how I told you you didn't
need to tell me everything?
I changed my mind.
What's in the backpack?
Where did you get that?
I don't want to lie to you.
But you don't want to
tell me the truth either.
I can't get on this flight
with you, Millie.
- Mm-hmm.
We lost him, sir.
- How many did you send?
- Two men.
- I told you to send everybody.
- Well, she said two would be enough...
but, uh, they missed him.
It's like he knew we were coming.
We're searching the grid now.
Keep me informed.
I'm taking a different tack.
William Rice?
Yeah.
I.R.S.
Could we, uh, go inside and talk?
I don't have to ask.
That's a courtesy.
- So, what's this all about?
Your son. David.
Why? Is he in some kind
of trouble or something?
This will go a lot swifter
if you let me ask the questions.
When's the last time
you saw your son?
Eight years ago.
Eight years?
That's right.
What about friends?
Anybody I can talk to?
He didn't have
a whole lot of friends.
I'd like to talk to
David's mother if I could.
Yeah, me too.
If you find her, tell her I said hello.
That her?
Mary Rice. At least that was
her name back then.
When's the last time you saw her?
She split when the kid turned five.
Five. Oh.
If I hear anything,
I'll be sure to give you a holler.
- No, you won't.
- No. I won't.
Have you seen the special move
you can do on this new thing?
They've added this
new control and, like,
you just... If you... Just
double-click it. See that?
What do you say?
Whoa.
Still alive, are ya?
- What? That's just great.
- There's more of them?
Hundreds more. I'm
tracking 10 right now.
- What about the rest?
- What about the rest?
Like I said, I hunt them.
- So who are these guys?
I told you.
They're Paladins.
Yeah, you told me their name.
You didn't tell me what they want.
- Well, it's pretty simple,
isn't it? They want us dead.
- Didn't you figure that out yet?
-  Yeah. No, I got that much.
- Good. I'm glad.
- Yeah. Thanks.
- Do you mind just, uh...
- Why?
Because we can do
whatever the hell we want.
- Now can you please just...
- I'm hit!
- He's dead.
- Great. Thanks.
You really don't get it, do you?
Paladins have been killing
Jumpers for years.
Way back since medieval times.
They're fanatics.
Religious nut jobs.
Inquisition. Witch hunts.
That was them.
Look. They're smart.
They're fast. They're organized.
No matter what, they'll kill anyone
that gets in their way.
Like your family.
Your friends.
That little girlfriend
you're traipsing around Rome with you.
They're dead.
All of'em.
Get used to it.
It's just a matter of time.
I'm gonna get some takeaway.
Do you want some?
He's your father.
I'm sorry. I talked to him,
but he wouldn't budge.
I don't know how my
mother puts up with him.
Somebody get some help!
- Now!
You okay? Stay still.
Oh!
- Mark.
- Jesus Christ.
- What did you tell him?
- How did they know about Ann Arbor?
- Don't touch me.
- Who'd you tell?
- Stay the hell away from me.
Was it a black guy with white hair?
Was his name Roland?
Just answer the question...
or I'll drop you off the top
of Mount Everest, okay?
- What? What?
- What did you tell him?
I don't... What? Tell what?
I know you told him
about home, all right?
I know you told him about Ann Arbor.
Did you tell him about Millie?
I told him everything.
Why?
Why did you do that?
- Why not?
-
Whoa! Whew!
Where'd the Paladin go?
- Swimming.
- Pacific?
No. Actually, Atlantic.
Nice little shark pit round Cuba.
- Put that stuff back!
Actually, I need to borrow a few things.
Just stay away from the wall!
I'll cut your eyes out.
I need to find Roland.
No, you don't.
No, you don't.
- I only got eight hours.
- Eight hours?
There's a girl...
Her flight lands in eight hours.
Think that stuff's gonna help?
That stuff's four years old.
I've been tracking him for 10 years.
Look at this. Look.
You see this?
Our first round in Nepal.
You should see the one he gave me
back in Prague.
Look. Forget it.
Forget Roland.
Don't waste your time.
Just leave it to me.
- Do you mind?
- Look.
Little, uh... Little privacy here?
You know, this is
kind of my thing. Just...
Just... Get... You know, turn around.
Yeah.
I'm... I was thinking
that if we do this together...
we could get him.
What? You mean, like, you and me?
- Like we team up?
- Yeah.
-
Look. I'm sorry,
but I don't play well with others.
Find a rock. Crawl under it.
Stay there.
That's "good-bye" in Chinese.
Yeah. No. I've been meaning to call.
Really. I still really
want to get the tattoo.
-
-
You can't keep following me.
Yeah, lucky me.
Why are you walking?
I mean, I... I know Tokyo pretty well.
I got a lot of jump sites here.
You know, I-I... I like
walking for a change.
Makes me feel normal.
You, uh... You ever read
Marvel Team-up?
Yeah, I read it. And?
Two superheroes joining forces
for, like, uh, a limited run.
I see what you're trying to do, yeah?
I'm not buying it.
For your own sake, just go home.
- You live in a cave.
- It's called a lair.
And what's the point?
I'm just saying, you know.
We, uh, kind of have this common thing.
And I know where to find Roland.
So we doing this, or what?
Sorry. Clutch stuck.
- You're real subtle.
Yeah, I'm not gonna
get rid of you, am I?
Whoa. Whoa.
You might want to hold on, son.
That was close.
Not bad.
This thing must be two tons, easy.
How are you, uh...
If it moves, I can jump it.
tried to hop a whole building.
- Won't be trying that again.
- Why's that?
That's 'cause he's dead.
Killed him.
Still managed to shake it
a little though.
- Doing what? Driving?
- No. Jumping.
- Since I was five.
- Five?
- Yeah.
How'd you keep it a secret from people?
It's pretty easy when
they're not around.
- Where were they?
Not around.
You know, my mom...
she took off when I was five.
My dad, he...
Did I ask about your family?
I mean, are we on
Griffin, I can't keep
doing this. I gotta go.
Her flight lands any second.
I need an answer.
-
-
This is it, all right?
Marvel Team-up, now or never.
-
- A very limited run, right?
Save her, kill him, you know.
We're done.
All right, Spidey.
Hey!
Due to increased security
measures, all bags...
- Hey!
Detroit International
Airport asks you...
- Hey.
The flight from Rome landed an hour ago.
Oh, no.
All right. Well, we gotta find her,
you know.
You go find her. I'm gonna arm up.
Meet me back at the lair.
- All right?
- Fine.
What you looking at?
Boo!
Hey. Uh, I'm Millie's friend,
David. Is she here?
Last I checked she was with you.
Hey. Your friend came by.
- What are you talking about?
Black guy, white hair.
You just missed him.
- Jesus.
- Hey.
What the hell are you doing here?
I buzzed, but you didn't pick up.
- So you just broke in?
- Yeah. Well, I needed to
make sure that you were okay.
I'm sorry.
You're sorry.
Thank you.
I think you should leave.
- What? What are you doing?
- Uh...
- David, I told you to leave.
- Uh...
- "Um" what?
- I'm not in banking, okay?
- No, really?
- I mean, the money did come
from a bank, you know.
Yeah.
- Uh, a few banks, actually.
Are... Are you telling
me you're a bank robber?
Small part. Uh...
Will you please get out of my house?
Uh-huh.
-
- Millie, I'm sorry.
Wh... Oh, my God. Okay.
- Just go. Leave me alone.
Come on.
This might hurt a little bit, okay?
-
-
- It's okay.
- Where am I?
Trust me, okay?
- I'm not gonna hurt you.
- Don't you even come near me.
- Millie.
- Don't even come near me.
I'm gonna explain this, all right?
I'm gonna explain everything.
In here.
Just, uh... Just stay
where you are, all right?
Just stay right there.
- David?
-  Hurry up. It's closing.
There's something I gotta tell ya.
- Did you find her?
There's something that's
gonna piss you off.
- Piss me off?
- David.
What is this?
- David?
- What's she doing here?
- This isn't some kind
of clubhouse, you know.
- Wanna see the top of Everest?
- I was trying to tell you.
- Maybe the bottom?
- What?
- Griffin, listen to me. I...
That's what I was
trying to tell you.
By bringing her down here, they can
follow you. They have a machine.
- It can open wormholes
and keep them open.
What are you talking about?
I'm saying they can
follow us anywhere.
And you brought her here.
- Shit.
- There's two of you?
David, what is going on?
Millie... Millie, stay right here.
No. No!
- What have you done?
- Griffin...
- Where does this thing go?
- We gotta go.
David, what did you do?
Holy shit.
-
-
I never hurt anybody.
Not yet, but you will.
Sooner or later, you all go bad.
What if I'm different?
- You're not different.
-  I'm different.
-  Boo.
- Move!
-
-
-
Millie, get out of here.
Run, okay?
-
-
I'm gonna get you down
so you can get me out of here.
Great.
-
Can you take me now, please?
Okay.
I'll take you.
I'll leave you alone.
It was always you though.
Ever since we were five.
It was always you.
Please just take me.
Take a deep breath.
I got it.
I trapped them there.
No. Millie.
- Got her!
- No!
Crap. I, uh... I didn't expect that.
I... I didn't know.
Now they have to come to us.
Let's get these fires out.
- Huh? What?
- What are you doing?
Nothing. I was, uh,
thinking about going bowling.
- What?
What? Roland's in there
with his whole army.
I'm gonna go back there and end this.
What do you think?
- Yeah, but Millie's in there.
Well, yeah, there is that as well.
- Huh?
Griffin, it's my fault that she's there.
All right? You...
- What?
I can hear you! I'm not deaf.
I understand what you're saying.
- All right. Well...
- It's a crying shame. It really is.
But you know what? We all have to...
make sacrifices once
in a while. You know.
Where's the detonator?
-
You know what?
I made mine.
All right?
When I was five.
Came to my house
and killed my parents.
David, David.
Yeah?
How about
this for talking, huh?
Am I getting the message through to you?
I can't let you do this.
Look, David. You touch the safe again,
and I'm gonna kill you. Have you got it?
Give me the detonator, David!
- Give it back!
- Sorry, Griffin!
-
Give it back!
-  Whoa.
-  Whoa!
Don't.
Bad move.
-
-  Hey!
Oh, shit.
-
-
- God, I hate Chechnya.
Where'd you go?
-
-
- Thanks.
Cut me down, and, uh, we
can finish this, yeah?
You know, it didn't have to be this way.
There's five of them back there.
You go back there alone, you're dead.
You hear me?
You can't win!
Get me down, David!
You do this alone, and you're dead.
You're not a hero, David!
You're a Jumper!
You don't save the girl!
Don't you get it?
- Whoa.
-
No!
Shit.
There's some things
you can't jump, David.
- Only God should have this power.
Not you, David.
David, I'm so sorry
about what I said before.
Take a deep breath.
David. Hey. Hey.
David? Hey. Hey.
David!
-  Ooh.
- Shit. I'm sorry.
- Oh, you...
- I'm sorry.
What's my dishwasher
doing in the library?
Oh.
David!
- Stay here, okay?
What?
I told you I'm different.
I could have dropped you
with the sharks.
Hi.
Can I help you?
Is-Is Mary here?
Hey, Mom.
Honey, why don't you wait upstairs?
Okay.
You know, it wasn't
easy finding you.
You shouldn't be here.
So it's true.
You're one of them.
Yes, it's true.
Kill you, or leave you.
So you left.
- I was five.
I did what I had to do.
I've never stopped thinking about you.
Not even for one day.
So I'm a Jumper.
You're a Paladin.
That's right.
What now?
I'm giving you a head start, Son...
because I love you.
Good luck.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
You sure?
Yeah. I am.
Good.
'Cause I'm freezing.
Can we please go someplace warm?
- Where do you want to go?
- Surprise me.
