We cannot hide our ways any longer.
Nor should we.
The Ori have amassed armies
that move to destroy us.
Everything we believe
or we are is an affront to them.
They will stop at nothing to destroy
every last shred of evidence
that opposes their fanaticism.
We have no choice.
We have tried to argue reason.
We can fight,
use what we know to oppose them.
We are so few compared to them.
Is forced indoctrination
really the answer?
You would deny the Ori
the very essence of self.
It is no different
than the murder they propose.
The only moral way
to change someone's mind,
make them see the truth as you put it,
is to present evidence.
We believe
in the systematic understanding
observation and experimentation, through
argument and debate,
but most of all, freedom of will.
I will not compromise
the fundamental tenets of my devotion
in order to preserve it.
We acknowledge the incredible potential
of the technology of the Ark.
And the danger
such power presents.
It will not be used
as a weapon against the Ori.
The debate on the issue is closed.
Give me a hand?
You really think this is it?
Well,
it's covered in Ancient writing.
These symbols here are a part
of the oldest dialect I'm aware of.
It says
"... safely kept is the
something of old."
What's the something, Daniel?
Well, if I knew for sure,
I wouldn't have said the something...
- Why am I answering her?
- Stop your yammering and open it.
- We can't just open it.
- Why not?
it's a powerful piece
of Ancient technology
capable of making anyone
who looks into it believe
that the Ori are not gods.
As far as we know.
But we already believe that.
No harm done, open it.
{\I said "as far as we know". There may be other things it's capable of making you believe.}As far as we know. Maybe
it can make you believe other things.
Maybe, we're supposed to believe
{\those other things}them too.
{\You know, t}That's beside the point, there's
another reason we can't just open it.
They are raw and bleeding.
I've broken every nail.
We've been out here
in the scorching heat for days.
- I haven't showered.
- None of us have.
That is painfully obvious.
Now, according to you,
this crusty old chest
is our salvation from oppression
at the hands of the Ori army.
Our best, and maybe,
only remaining chance that we have.
We have dug
how many holes in the ground?
- Help me out here, Muscles.
- Many.
Now, all the years
the Jaffa were here,
they knew{\ that} Dakara was the first landing
place of the Alterans in this galaxy.
You mean to tell me they never looked
for Ancient artefacts?
There were a few artefacts
that were excavated
and catalogued
when the city was being rebuilt.
But, with the constant change
of leadership, little time or manpow...
Bla bla bla.
But here we are.
Finally. We may have found it:
The Ultimate Weapon.
So could someone{\ please}
explain to me why we can't
confirm our blessed fortune
by simply opening it?
Because it's sealed shut.
It definitely won't open.
Why didn't you say so?
{\Well, }I was trying to
but you wouldn't stop your yammering.
No no! You can't do that! I told you
this is a piece of technology.
You could damage it.
It's been buried for millions of years.
What?
I do not remember sending out
invitations to this party.
We have to fall back!
Move ahead!
What are you doing?
We have to go there.
We know.
There's too many of them.
- There's no other way out of here.
- We know!
How about now?
Yeah, "now" works for me.
Commander, we have them trapped.
Vala, it's Tomin.
That's funny.
I was just about
to say the same thing!
Vala, you have to trust me. Your
position has been targeted from space.
I think we have to trust him.
Jackson?
What if we got them to open it?
Well it wouldn't be the worst thing
in the world, would it?
All right.
Invite him in.
You can come in.
I look like crap.
Hi!
How are you?
What's new?
What are you doing here?
Took the words right out of my mouth.
How did you know we were here?
The power of the Ori
need not be questioned.
Oh... Here we go.
Tell me.
What is this artefact you have found?
Shouldn't you know that, already?
Your logic.
No, wait, wait.
No need to be difficult here.
You wanna know what it is?
I'll tell you.
Inside this Ark is a secret
to destroying the armies of the Ori.
And I think the last thing
you wanna do is to open it.
You think I fear the content?
I'm saying you really should.
Open it!
- You didn't hear what I just said?
- Open it!
It's sealed shut.
Wait, no!
Not what I was expecting.
Foolhardy are those
who do not follow the path.
Anyone wanna bet
what he's gonna say next?
Kill them.
I could have made money on that one.
Prior!
I gave them my word,
if they surrendered peacefully,
- they would be spared.
- Your word...?
- {\The word of the Ori is all that matters!}Only the word of the Ori matters!
- The Book of Origin says the truth
is the begining of the path...
Tomin, I grow tired
of your questioning!
Kill them now or you shall burn
in a fire of everlasting torment.
He can't hurt you, Tomin.
We trusted you.
Trust me now.
- Fire your weapon!
- You think he's testing you.
Really he's forcing you to do it
because he's realized that for
some reason beyond his comprehension,
he's completely powerless.
Kill them!
I command you!
Stop! Do not fire!
How?
Here.
We can show you.
We use this device.
It temporarily neutralizes
their abilities.
the Ori crusade is planning to send
a new wave of ships
through the Supergate sometimes soon.
The coordinated attack on Earth
may be imminent.
It's a little non specific.
That's why I suspect the Priors release
details on a need-to-know basis.
Shame you didn't find the real Ark.
Yes, Sir.
But not for lack of trying.
No other useful intelligence?
Well, at the moment,
Tomin is coming to grips with the fact
that he's devoted his life
to serving false gods.
Great.
What does he want?
Who is that?
Come on in.
You might as well meet him.
Colonel Mitchell.
I recognized you from your file.
Mitchell, this is James Merek.
IOA oversight.
I'm a huge fan, Colonel.
It's a real pleasure to meet you.
What happened to Woolsey?
His time has been taken out
by the Atlantis expedition.
Which, quite frankly,
I'm grateful for.
It is a thrill for me to be here.
You have been doing such an incredible
job under such difficult circumstances.
I don't think this gonna be much
for me to do here other than...
stay out of your way.
What do you want?
I believe protocol requires me
to notify you
that I will be interrogating
the prisoner personally.
I believe your report
refers to him as Tomin.
No last name.
Right. Sorry, I...
I get confused. See,
we were thinking of him more as a guest.
Of course.
My mistake.
I trust the enemy commander
hell-bent on our total annihilation
has been given comfortable quarters.
Yeah, he's had a change of heart.
Come on, Colonel.
Don't all bad guys say that
after we capture them?
Actually, he captured us,
and then, he surrendered.
And my people have already
questioned the man.
No, I see. Look,
I'm sorry.
I really don't wanna step
on any toes here.
My superiors have asked me to prepare
a report on this matter personally,
and I don't want to disappoint them.
You know, me being new
in my job and all.
You understand.
Of course.
Thanks so much.
I can't tell you how exciting it is
for me to be working here with you.
Actually, I used to do what you do,
Colonel, so I know exactly how it feels.
I'm sure you know
I'm just trying to do my job.
Thank you, Mr Merek.
General.
Colonel.
He used to do what
I do.
What{\ the hell} does that mean?
What's his background?
Former CIA. Black ops.
Oh great! So the IOA is...
having one of our own spies
spy on us.
I have no doubt
the IOA chose him carefully.
Why do I get the feeling
we're gonna miss Woolsey?
The Ori are dead and gone.
As we said,
we don't exactly know for sure.
We know we sent
a weapon to the Ori galaxy
that was supposed to be
capable of destroying them.
But not those that worship them.
No. Not humans.
Just the ascended beings.
I know it sounds complicated
but the point is, unless we stop it,
this holy crusade
in the name of the Ori
could end in a bloody mess
for all humans.
A futile bloody mess.
And your hope is that this Ark
will convince those
that still believe in the Ori
to stop believing as they do.
In Ancient,
it's called "Armiria Veremas",
that loosely translated,
means the Ark of Truth.
I know I have no right to say this,
it just seems wrong.
Oh hey... I'm not saying it's right.
I mean,
obviously Alterans didn't think
it was morally right to use it
or we wouldn't be in this situation.
But compared to the bloodshed
we may be facing.
We think the Ark may be capable
of brainwashing people
to believe whatever it's programmed
to make them believe.
But how did you know where to look?
We didn't.
That chest we found
was obviously not the Ark.
But still you must have had some idea.
I've had a vision several times.
Daniel shared his mind with
the former Alteran named Merlin
for a short time.
His consciousness is gone{\ now}, but he was
the one who helped me build the device
We think that these visions might be
remnants of Merlin's memories,
left behind intentionally to steer us
in the direction of the Ark.
And you think I'm crazy
for believing in the Ori.
You're not crazy, Tomin. Just...
wrong.
You've both read the Book of Origin,
have you not?
Yes.
Do you not remember
the part about Ortus Mallum?
You've got to forgive me,
I don't know it by heart.
Book with fine printing,
not many pictures.
Ortus Mallum
is the birth place of all evil.
The passage speaks of a mountain
that erupts and buries the place
where all evil once sprang forth.
Look, I only ask because you mentioned
a mountain that explodes in your vision.
Amelius, what are you doing?
It's time to go.
I know.
They have to know the truth.
They will find nothing.
All will be destroyed.
My notebook.
I had the most amazing idea last night.
Well, we think we could use
the ZPM on board the Odyssey.
Unfortunately,
it's nowhere near enough power
to sustain an outgoing wormhole
indefinitely.
I take it doing the whole Pegasus thing
again is not an option.
The fact is we were lucky to avoid the
attack from the Wraith the first time.
we believe we can beam
strategically in between
the Supergate's individual segments.
Hopefully, undetected,
they'll be triggered
by any inbound Gate activation.
The resulting explosion should,
theoretically, create a chain reaction
that will essentially utilize
the massive amounts of energy
being channeled into the Gate
from the dialing galaxy, to destroy it.
Don't blow it up just yet.
We may still need that Supergate.
Dr. Jackson.
The Ancients didn't bring the Ark with
them, Sir. It's still in the Ori galaxy.
Okay, then.
I just need to get a few things
straight here, for the record.
Okay?
Shouldn't be that hard.
So...
- you're a commander in the Ori army.
- I was.
Yes, was.
Of course.
So...
your duties as a commander involved...
Following the orders of the Priors,
supervising the warriors
under my command.
Well...
good.
See?
No big deal.
Okay, moving on.
In the time that you've been here in our
galaxy, how many innocent human beings
would you say you slaughtered?
I'm talking personally here.
I'm sure you didn't keep
a running tally.
So maybe you could just give me
a general estimate.
Hundreds? Thousands? More?
- What do you want from me?
- I just want you to answer my questions
and I have quite a few.
They cover things like your plans,
your tactics, your numbers, training...
anything that might help us in defending
against the attack that you say
is coming. How many innocent human
beings would you say you slaughtered,
because they chose
not to believe in the Ori?
Where's Vala?
She could not bear to watch.
Did you hear the plan?
Tomin wishes to accompany us.
He believes he can help us establish
contact with the anti-Ori underground.
He may be in fact the best way to figure
out what Ortus Mallum actually is.
Well, we can definitely use
all the help we can get,
assuming of course the Ori
are actually dead.
Or this could be a very short mission.
Indeed.
- General.
- Colonel.
I was just giving
Dr. Jackson the good news.
The mission's been approved.
I thought it was already approved.
no mission is approved until
the IOA officially signs off on them.
You've been given
temporary command of the Odyssey
for the duration of this operation.
Sir, does that mean
I have to sit in the chair?
That it does.
And I wish the fun ended there.
Mr Merek will be overseeing
the mission.
Personally, I'm excited.
Yeah, me too.
That's to be my first time
on one of our battle cruisers.
See you on board, Colonel.
Dr. Jackson.
General.
Can I confine him to quarters?
It's your call, Colonel.
One of the decisions those of us
in command have to make.
Thank you, Sir.
Thank you, Sir.
Ready to fly.
We're ready to go, Sir.
All right.
Weapons to maximum.
Sir?
It's a joke, Marks.
Make it go.
Nothing I have done since
turning against the Goa'uld
will make up for the atrocities
I once committed in their name.
Somewhere deep inside you,
you knew it was wrong.
A voice you did not recognize
screamed for you to stop.
You saw no way out.
You tried to convince yourself that
the people you were hurting deserved it.
You became numb to their pain
and suffering.
You learned to shut out the voice
speaking against it.
There's always a choice.
- Indeed, there he is.
Yet you sit here now.
I sit here,
and I cannot imagine the day
when I will forgive myself.
Because it will never come.
One day, others may try to convince you
they have forgiven you.
That is more about them than you.
For them, imparting forgiveness
is a blessing.
How do you go on?
It is simple.
You will never forgive yourself.
Accept it.
You hurt others.
Many others.
That cannot be undone.
You will never find
personal retribution.
That which is right, just and true
can still prevail.
If you do not fight for what you believe
then all may be lost for everyone else.
Fight for others.
Others that may be saved
through your effort.
That is the least you can do.
Okay, I think we're ready.
Dial it up.
Looks like we have a stable connection.
What?
Based on the intel Daniel provided
when he was a Prior,
- I was pretty sure this was gonna work.
- Yeah, I didn't doubt that. It's just
now that we're actually here,
it's kinda cool.
Take her in.
You see that?
What?
That old man?
What about him?
Nothing.
Glad we had this chat.
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
In fact I get the feeling
we're on the right track.
This is Hermes.
Hermes, this is Daniel.
Vala, my wife.
We are still married.
We'll talk about that later.
the rumor that the fires of Celestis
have gone out.
Really?
I assume Tomin also explained
that we're not from around here.
That, he did.
Still, I'm surprised such news
wouldn't have spread far and wide.
You would think.
But perhaps Tomin didn't explain
exactly how far away we live.
The Priors have seen this as a sign
that the Ori are not pleased.
They say our efforts against
the crusade of evil are not enough,
that we must do more.
As I told you,
many more ships have been built.
They are ready to embark.
Tomin also tells me you seek
the true location of Ortus Mallum.
We do.
What makes you think such a place
actually exists in the real world?
You {\do not}don't believe all that is written in
the Book of Origin to be based in some
true historical event?
What I believe is not the issue.
Do you want me to tell you
what I believe?
I want you to prove it.
Well, that we can do.
There are ruins of a village
high in the mountains
that border the plains of Celestis.
That is believed to be the location the
Book of Origin references as the birth
- place of Evil.
The Ori followers built
their holy city on the planet
where they believed their gods
once triumphed over the Alterans.
Celestis isn't on this planet though.
If we show you our map, could you direct
us to the coordinates of the planet
where Celestis is?
We're talking about the Vatican
of the Ori followers, right?
then it's likely Merlin's device
worked, and the Ori are dead.
But the Priors are not.
{\Well, w}We didn't come all this way
to stop now, did we?
Many times throughout history, the ruins
of Ortus Mallum have been searched
by both the Priors of Ori,
and those that believe as we do.
We have long searched for the artefacts
that{\ wi}'ll prove the truth about our past,
our ancestors, and the falsehood
of the Book of Origin.
Let's hope that means
what we're looking for is still there.
Why was I not notified
that you had someone on board
with new intel about Ori army activity?
Well, I'm sure I called for you,
there was no answer. Oh, wait.
I may have not pressed the com button
all the way down.
I must've looked stupid
standing there talking to myself.
- Anyway, if you'll excuse us...
- Colonel.
I'm sure I don't need to remind you
about protocol.
We are all going to find the Ark,
Mr Merek, it's just too late
for you not to join us.
You were granted the use of this ship,
the most valuable asset
Earth currently has at its disposal,
to prevent any further Ori ships
from getting through the Supergate.
- And that's what we're gonna do.
- Do you
or do you not have reliable intelligence
that more
Ori ships are about to leave?
Stay out of my way.
- Your instructions were clear, Colonel.
- We're not there yet. Major Marks!
New coordinates have been entered
to the nav system. Take us there.
Yes, Sir.
You have no idea
how much time we have.
I'm not gonna sacrifice
this mission,
Earth, or our galaxy
for some fool's quest.
Then replace me!
Go ahead.
Replace me.
You sure you don't want the chair?
No.
It's all yours.
Got your back though.
Thanks.
Any idea where to start?
Not really.
You okay?
I was thinking about
what this place really was.
Colonel Mitchell,
this is Major Marks, come in.
We read you, Marks, go ahead.
Sir, someone
has turned on the Asgard core.
What?
Who?
Do you really need to ask?
According to the security access card
that was used,
it's Mr Merek.
The room is sealed
and he's not responding on the com.
It can't be shut down remotely.
What the hell does he think he's doing?
I don't know, but we better find out.
Jackson! Teal'c!
We gotta go, keep looking.
- What's wrong?
- Merek's up to something.
He's turned on the Asgard core.
That will alert the Ori ships
to our presence.
Yeah, I think that's the idea.
We got it, you guys...
find the Ark.
Transport Colonel Carter and myself
back up to the ship now.
It's SG-3, Sir.
Transmitting from P6X-437.
On screen.
A Prior arrived thru the Gate 15 minutes
ago and immediately made contact.
Not sure how,
but he seemed to know we were here.
He says he has no intention of harming
us, just he has a message to deliver
- What is it?
He wants us to let him
through the Gate?
Does he know this didn't exactly
work out well the last time?
More for the Prior
in question than us, Sir.
True.
Says the message is key
to human survival on Earth.
He says he knows
that we have a technology
that can temporary
neutralize his powers.
- He does, does he?
-
Apparently, word that SG-1 actually
killed a Prior is getting around.
Give us an hour to make
the necessary preparations.
Yes, Sir.
Reynolds out.
Open the door, Mr Merek.
Do you really think
we can't bypass the security lock?
You have put this ship and everyone
on board in serious danger.
Look, you know
that activating the Asgard core
will alert
any Ori vessel to our presence.
I assume that's your plan,
force me to take action against them.
- Carter?
- Almost.
It won't shut down.
No.
It's creating something virtually.
What is it?
You'll see.
I believe it's almost done.
What the hell are you thinking?
Unlike you, doing the job
that I was sent to do.
Stop any further Ori invasion
at all cost.
Well, how does getting us killed
and this ship destroyed accomplish that?
I assure you
that's not the plan, Colonel.
Oh, really? Because we're about to be
surrounded by a bunch of Ori ships.
So I figure we got 2 options.
We can shut that thing down
and hope to outrun them,
or we can stay and fight
and lose badly.
And that's where you're wrong.
There are always other options.
You're just failing to consider them.
I hate to be the downer
at this party, but this is hopeless.
I'm not getting any energy readings,
so, short of literally looking under
every rock and stone on this mountain,
I'm not sure what we're supposed to do.
Or we could wait for Daniel
to have another one of his visions.
Guys, I think there's something here.
I think
we're supposed to go down there.
This is Colonel Carter, we need
an ARG in the Asgard core room now.
Don't worry, {\Colonel,} it's being contained
by a force shield.
For now. If you knew anything
about these things, you'd know
- nothing will hold it for long.
- Do you have any idea
what it finally took
to eradicate these little buggers?
Exactly why it will be so effective
in neutralizing the Ori fleet.
That's your plan?
What are you? Totally nuts?
Not my plan.
It's the IOA's.
In the event that the Supergate
on this side was impossible to destroy,
a backup plan was devised.
We knew we could draw the Ori
to the Odyssey by turning on the core.
with a large number of them but we'd
certainly be able to hang in long enough
to get this Replicator
on board of one of their ships.
And since you
were unwilling to even try
to destroy the Gate,
you left me no choice.
We came here to find the Ark.
Nobody expected you to find it.
Excuse me?
The Ori ships are preparing to leave.
For all we know,
they're already gone.
Obviously, you didn't come up
with this on your own.
Who wrote this program?
Does it really matter?
Thank you.
The ARG won't penetrate the shield.
When I shut it down, don't hesitate.
-
- I won't.
Zats have no effect on them.
Neither did this thing.
You need P-90s.
Don't let it get away!
This way.
Why the hell didn't it work?
I believe that particular susceptibility
was programmed out of this version.
You slick son of a mental,
why didn't you tell us?
You obviously had no intention
of allowing me
- to follow through with the plan.
- If we can't stop it,
it will cannibalize
this ship and start replicating.
I should hope so.
And thanks to you it's now the only
way we have of infecting the Ori fleet.
And what the hell is the IOA gonna do
when the Replicators finish with the Ori
fleet and {\they }decide to take a little trip
Precautions to prevent that scenario
have been put in place.
Self destruct.
You built in some sort of shutdown
command into the programming.
It wasn't me.
{\Sir, }12 teams of 2 have been armed
and are searching top to bottom.
These things are crafty, Captain.
They'll avoid any area of the ship
exposed to internal sensors.
They're small enough to use
the ventilation shafts or
to move through hollow walls and it's
only a matter of time before we could
- be dealing with more than one.
- We'll find it, Sir.
Carter, talk to me.
The Asgard core was designed
to be very user friendly.
Whoever wrote this program didn't have
to have an extensive knowledge
of Replicator technology.
They only had to explain what they
wanted{\to create and}, the core filled in the blanks.
- And?
- Unfortunately, that means
the complete program
exists only in the core database.
Which means
{\that }you have to leave the core on
{\if you're gonna}to find the self destruct command.
If it even exists.
How long?
I don't know. I'm trying to narrow down
the search parameters but it's huge.
{\Alright, look,}Just forget about the fact that
we're standing here screaming and waving
our hands at the Ori. They probably
already know our position anyway.
{\Alright,}Let's jump into hyperspace. At least the
Ori ships won't be able to attack us.
Yeah but they can track us in hyperspace
and we can't stay there forever.
Believe me,
if we don't find that Replicator
or the self destruct command,
"forever": not going to be a big issue.
Hey guys, it's Mitchell, we're about
to beam you onboard immediately.
Wait, you can't, not yet.
Yeah, well,
Merek activated the Asgard core.
So we're expecting Ori ships
around here sometime soon.
Plus, we have
a little Replicator problem.
So we're going to jump into hyperspace
to avoid the bad guys
I'm sorry, did you say
"Replicator problem"?
Major Marks, transport the team
on the planet back up to the ship.
As soon as they are safely onboard,
take us into hyperspace.
Sir, I'm attempting to transport
the team on the surface
but the system is not responding.
I've lost control
of the ship's computer.
- It's plugged itself in somewhere.
- That was fast.
{\Well, i}It doesn't have much learning to do.
Everything about the Odyssey
and its systems has been preprogrammed
into the Replicator's memory.
I'm attempting to isolate life support,
navigation and hyperdrive command
and restrict it to the Asgard core.
Hopefully I can maintain
some measure of control from here.
Right, I'm going to help
find the damn thing.
What's a Replicator?
You do not wish to know.
Your friendly neighborhood
ship's commander.
Looks like you got
a little more time down there.
We're having a bit of trouble
with the beaming thing at the moment.
Okay, so?
Onwards.
What do you think, Muscles?
Wait wait wait, we can't.
We don't know how stable this tunnel is.
So we turn back then, Daniel Jackson?
Bombs away.
Sir, we have lost
the external communications array,
we are experiencing power fluctuations
throughout the power grid.
Yeah, I got that.
Daniel Jackson.
This is it.
Oh, you're sure this time?
Definitely.
We found it.
You demonstrate great courage
facing me in person,
General.
Courage is only required
when facing that what you fear.
The flames of ignorance
burn without pain.
Beware the power,
or it will consume you
before you know.
You can skip the fire and brimstone.
If you're here to tell me
that you're finally coming after Earth,
I already know.
It is not too late.
Allow me to deliver
the message to your world
that Origin is the way to salvation
and you will all be spared.
I have to tell you,
even if I did let you have your say,
I don't think my world is gonna listen.
Then you are all doomed.
That may be so.
But I don't think
it's you that's gonna do it.
I would not be so sure.
Really?
What took you so long?
Earth has to be the most
densily populated planet in the galaxy.
What are you waiting for?
Sure you've tried to...
warn us a couple of times, but come on,
you can do better than that, can't you?
We've been a tremendous
pain in your proverbial backside.
You don't really expect me
to believe that you...
you've just been saving
the best for last, do you?
What's wrong?
You guys are never speechless.
I'll tell you what I think.
I say this move
reeks of desperation.
You're not all that sure to slam-dunk.
Your defences are no match
for the might of the Ori
which shall rain down Apocalypse upon...
Right, right, here's a news flash.
The Ori are dead.
We killed them.
Sent a weapon devised by a ex-Ancient
through the Supergate,
and wiped them all out.
These beings you call gods,
the ones who lied to you,
manipulated you,
for their own selfish
power-hungry reasons
are gone.
And everything you think
you're doing in their name
is entirely without meaning.
I was wrong.
You are not courageous, General.
You are without reason.
Your planet will burn
in all the depths of darkness.
We'll see about that.
There is one thing I do know for sure.
If we're going to hell,
then you're coming with us.
You go ahead and burst
into flames if you like.
to the rear auxiliary
control room in your level.
Copy that.
All personnel, this is Colonel Mitchell.
Please report, I got it.
Oh, shit!
{\Hey, Sam, t}They seem to be living up to their name.
There's {\definitely }more than one at this point.
- How many?
- A lot.
The original has probably
converted into a queen by now.
The good news is {\that }it's likely stationary.
Other Replicators will bring it
raw material {\that }
it will then use to create new blocks.
That's what you're looking for
at this point.
Cam?
Cam!
Daniel, for goodness sake,
stop fussing,
- and just open it!
- Wait, wait, wait!
What was supposed to happen?
Nothing.
I don't think it's turned on.
Maybe it's broken.
Perhaps its power source
has been depleted.
- {\Well, i}It is millions of years old.
- I don't think it's turned on.
Well, turn it on then.
I think...
it has something to do with
these symbols.
They look like buttons.
Perhaps we should examine
more closely on the surface.
Good idea.
Cam!
Cam, are you there? Please respond.
Sorry about that Sam,
I ran out of ammo and had to hide.
Copy.
Colonel?
Four Ori mother ships on sensors.
They're moving to surround us.
Got it. Jumping to hyperspace.
Odyssey, this is Teal'c. Come in.
Odyssey, this is Teal'c. Come in.
Teal'c!
I assume you haven't found
the magic shut off switch?
No. The Replicators are going to come
after the core sooner or later.
I don't know why they haven't yet.
- Consolidating their numbers?
- Whatever they're trying to do,
eventually, they're going to want
to take total control of this ship.
{\And i}In order to do that,
they{\'re gonna}'ll have to get into this room.
We should stop them from doing that.
I got people trapped all over the place.
Replicators have blocked down most
of the elevators and bulkheads.
{\They're t}Trying to restrict the crew movement.
They've also shutdown systems
all over the ship.
It takes a lot of power to replicate.
My guess is the queen has set up shop
somewhere close to a main conduit.
Position all the personnel you have
right here, protect that room
- at all cost.
- We should probably weld the door shut.
- You won't be able to get out.
- If the Replicators make it
- into the core, it's not {\going to}gonna matter.
- Do it. I'm going to go find the queen.
Like grandma said,
you want honey, follow the bees.
Sounds like a good way
of getting stung to me.
Hey!
Hello?
Let me out of here.
Anybody?
Help!
Daniel Jackson?
Vala Mal Doran?
Odyssey... This is Teal'c.
Do you read me?
Odyssey, this is Teal'c.
Can you hear me?
God!
Your gods cannot save you now,
Daniel Jackson.
Well... That's just a statement
of general dissatisfaction.
Please, mercy.
They're comin'.
Carter, I found it.
It's in an access tube
off cargo hold three.
That's good.
Now get the hell out of there.
-
- Not yet.
it's making more of
those little buggers right now.
Destroying the Queen will likely draw
any other Replicators{\ on board} directly to you.
Not a good plan until
we have the shutdown code.
Right.
Besides, they're not coming
after the core just yet.
When they do, we may need
the distraction to draw them away.
Copy that.
This program is huge.
That could take weeks to go through.
- Skim.
- What if I miss it?
It's a base directive. It's like the one
that tells them to replicate.
Only this one,
when transmitted on a certain frequency,
will command them to disassemble.
It should stand out.
What the hell?
So much for the rumors.
- Oh no!
- What?
I asked the core to analyze the program
looking for the shutdown command.
- It says there isn't one.
- Can we write one?
Already started.
Good to see you, Mother.
Or should I call you Vala?
I believe you renounced our
blood relation last time I saw you.
Seems you have
no blood left to speak of.
You'll be somewhat satisfied to know
that Merlin's weapon did work.
The Ori were destroyed.
Really?
Somehow,
you and your simple human friends
managed to destroy quite a large group
of very powerful ascended beings.
Well, we're a very determined bunch.
I always say you never know
what you can do until you try.
I agree.
You don't seem too cut up about it.
No.
The energy transferred to
the Ori by their human followers
used to be spread out among many.
I get it all.
If you don't kill us all first.
It's a shame I can't use
your little discovery
to convince everyone
in your galaxy to follow me.
It would be much more humane.
Not as much fun, though.
Not wanting to give you any ideas
but why can't you use the Ark?
It's just not the same.
People need to be convinced
to see me for what I really am.
A spoiled brat with a God complex.
No, Mother.
The Ark can only be programmed
to make people believe what is true.
Once the Ancients have been destroyed,
I will be a being
of unchallengeable power, worshipped
by all those beneath me.
A true god by any definition,
wouldn't you say?
You know, I think we really...
We got off on the wrong foot.
Who am I kidding?
I knew you were an asshole
the moment we met.
Colonel,
we're running out of ammo, here.
Cam, we could really use
that distraction now.
Roger that, Sam.
I'm working on it.
We're being overrun.
You need to draw them away.
I'm on it ASAP.
You're looking for this?
Did I drop that?
{\I don't suppose y}You'd mind flipping that switch
and blowing us both up, would you?
Why do you need to take on the Ancients?
Seriously, how many human worshippers
do you really need?
Can't you just live with
what you have and be happy?
I mean, my own mother
used to say to me: "Vala,
happiness is not something you can buy."
Or in my case, steal.
- But I think the point is...
- They are a threat to me.
From what I understand,
they don't even care about you.
They saw the Ori as a threat
and they did nothing about that.
That's what you chose to believe.
They gave you the means
to destroy the Ori.
They'll stop at nothing to destroy me.
I will not rest
until they're all wiped from existence.
I wish you hadn't inherited
my determination.
Sir, long range sensors just picked up
seven Ori mother ships
exiting hyperspace
in our solar system.
I've Colonel Ellis for you.
General, we have visual
of enemy contacts.
- For the moment.
-
The weapons platform
in Antartica is incapable
of defending the planet
against seven Ori ships.
So why are they waiting?
Yes, Sir.
I don't know. Just be glad
they're giving us a little more time.
Sir, given how seriously
outgunned we are,
I don't see how a little
more time really helps
or what could possibly
save us at this point.
I was hoping...
SG-1 might show up at some point.
-
- I tell you this much,
We just dropped out of hyperspace.
That's funny, I was just thinking
we couldn't get anymore screwed.
The Replicators took back
navigation and hyperdrive control.
Four Ori mother ships
just appeared on sensors!
Kill me!
Believe me, I'm trying.
They did this to get
the self-destruct code.
What is it?
Tell me!
I don't know.
It's on the other side of the crystal.
You're not Merlin.
Then help me.
You must find the strength.
Nope.
No.
No, I've had it.
You know, I'm really not
in the mood for games right now.
You're not a figment of my imagination
and you're not...
Merlin.
You're Morgan le Fey.
You're delirious.
Merlin died.
He didn't ascend.
His consciousness left me and it's...
it's gone.
The Ancients must be able to see
through your disguise, I know I can.
I just don't know
why you think it's necessary.
You were once ascended.
You know how complicated it can be.
Interfering with the lower planes
is not allowed.
Yeah I know.
I did it myself more than once.
Helping me is forbidden and letting me
know you're helping me, well, that's...
worse.
I did it once and they stopped me.
I was exiled for it.
Yet, here you are.
Merlin saw the Ori for what they were.
He knew they needed to be stopped.
I was the one who prevented him
from doing it the first time.
You kept him alive.
You helped us find him.
I realized he was right.
The Ori were going
to destroy the Ancients.
No matter they want to admit it or not,
we saved them.
I think we deserve
the Ancients' help in return.
So I believe.
Then help us.
I've done all I can.
No, you can do more.
You can do much more,
and you have to.
Not on my own.
She's too powerful for me.
She...
you mean Adria, don't you?
She took on the mantle of the Ori.
Yeah, I was afraid of that.
- She has their galactic power.
- Then take it away from her.
And not just for our sake.
I've distracted her,
I've helped you when you needed me.
I promise you, Daniel,
I've done all I can.
No.
You need only use the Ark
on one Prior.
The crystals in their staffs
are linked to one another.
It's how the Doci communicates
with all at once.
If you can turn just one of them,
Adria's power will be
greatly diminished.
How?
How?
Carter, I hope you can hear this.
The self-destruct program
is on the other side of the crystal.
Oh, hell.
Tomin.
Tomin, it's Vala.
Now, come on.
Come on!
Come here.
Listen.
Everything's gonna be okay,
I promise.
Can you pull yourself together?
Good.
Now, I want you
to help me find Daniel.
I'm right here.
You guys okay?
I don't feel very good.
Let's find the Ark.
Come.
Oh, give me a break.
Shields are at 18%,
hyperdrive is still offline.
And then she just suddenly disappeared
somewhere as if she had
something really important to do.
And when I turned around, about
seven symbols on the Ark were glowing.
- It was Morgan.
- Is she helping, because
- if she is, I don't understand...
- Which seven symbols?
{\Well, y}You don't expect me to remember?
With the fate of 2 galaxies {\hanging }
in the balance, {\yes, }I expect you to remember
the {\essential }clue given to you
by {\a powerful}an ascended being.
The glow wasn't that long{\. It was}, more like
a bright light when I turned around,
- I realised I was alone{\ and might }-- look for you.
- Which ones?
One here, two here,
two here, and two there.
- Does it come in any order?
- No, all at once.
- Of course.
- Someone's coming.
Okay, seven symbols.
Just make a guess.
- "Veramas" is truth in Ancient.
- Good.
Two there.
I guess not.
This is Colonel Mitchell of the Earth
ship Odyssey. We surrender.
Please cease fire.
Repeat, we surrender.
Sam?
I don't think they're gonna stop.
I have to get the hyperdrive back
in time. We can't take much more.
You can't win.
There's only one path,
the power and glory of Origin.
Adria.
I'm sorry.
-
- Me too.
We're obviously never
going to agree.
Are you gonna kill me now?
No! You can't take away my power.
I think we just did.
You will all burn
in the fires of eternal damnation.
Not if I have anything to do with it.
You're no match for me.
I am now.
What?
What did he say?
I don't understand.
He said: "Have mercy,
"I was blind, but now I see."
Sam!
Why did they stop?
but I'm glad they did.
It was "Origin".
What was?
The keyword that activated the Ark.
I realized while Adria was talking,
{\the }in Ancient, {\version of }the word also means
truth, in older dialects.
I guess the Alteran that built it
must have thought it was ironic.
You know, I'm starting to think
that irony is very overrated.
Have you reconsidered?
No.
I do not understand.
Take it.
We have something to show you.
What is the meaning of this?
See for yourself.
Hey.
Hey.
- How did it go?
- Worked like a charm.
Daniel was right.
The Priors' staffs still all seemed
to be connected somehow.
Were they in each galaxy?
Yeah, {\I mean, }whatever subspace link connects
them is obviously somewhat limited.
And {\still }when Daniel opened the Ark
for the Prior{\ that was here},
everyone seemed to get the message.
- The ships backed off.
- Yep.
Sorry I missed it.
How are you doing?
You know,
I've felt worse.
Well, apparently, when you're feeling
better, the IOA wants to meet with you.
Really?
Something about an apology.
I don't know. My recovery
could take a while.
Yeah. Not too long I hope.
- No.
- Oh, sorry.
It's okay.
I guess maybe that hurts a little.
I'll...
let you rest.
Sam.
Yeah.
What's in the bag?
My God. I almost forgot.
I baked these for you.
Macaroons.
I'm sure they're not as good
as your grandma's.
Nice recall.
Cheek okay?
Yeah.
You're going to make a great leader.
When I was being tortured
by the Prior,
the teachings of Origin
gave me the strength I needed.
There are still so many things about it
that mean a great deal to me.
I don't doubt that there is morality and
wisdom in it, that's what made it
a such powerful law for so many people.
I think in principle
the idea of bettering ourselves and
seeking Ascension,
in one way or another,
that's what it's all really about.
It might just need some revision.
Well, that's entirely up to you
and your people.
Though I might humbly recommend
that the part about burning people alive
for not following along
should be the first bit to go.
Perhaps throw in
some colored pictures.
Now I haven't asked
because I fear I know the answer.
But now that I'm leaving.
I don't exactly know
where my place is.
But I hope it's here.
I'm sorry.
I know I'll never make up
for the things I've done.
But I promise you I'll spend
the rest of my life trying.
I know.
So will I.
I know I was the one who found it.
I'm not entirely happy with the fact
we were forced to use it{\ either}.{\But} I think
it was better than the alternative.
- No one disagrees with you.
- But it is a very dangerous piece
- of technology to keep lying around.
- It's out of my hands{\, Dr. Jackson}.
{\Okay, l}Let's say someone does figure how to
reprogram it.
Or worse, {\let's say }it falls in the wrong hands.
It could be the most
powerful weapon
we've ever come across.
I'm well aware of the risk.
So is the IOA.
For now,
the Ark is being studied at Area 51.
That's all I know.
I'm sorry, Dr. Jackson.
I've done all I can do.
It's kinda weird, not having
a big bad guy to fight any more.
{\Yeah, t}That's what we thought
when we defeated the Goa'uld,
and the Replicators, the first time.
Well, Jackson and Vala
took care of that.
That whole Ori thing
was not our fault.
Just take the blame,
you'll get used to it.
We played a big part
in fixing the problem.
There are still many planets
on our Gate system
that may remain unexplored.
Yes. Let's see what mysteries
P3K-546 withholds.
And what treasure.
I'm sure something will come up.
Walter, hit it!
