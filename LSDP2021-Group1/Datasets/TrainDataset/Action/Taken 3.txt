- CLARENCE: Honey?
- Hmm?
- Have you seen my checkbook?
- Yeah. It's downstairs in the living room.
-
- Shh.
Darling, are you okay?
Fine!
CLAIRE: Are you sure?
I'm just gonna take the dog for a walk.
Okay.
Nice office.
Nice family.
Sorry to disturb you
at this time of night...
but we have a little problem.
Your boss owes me money.
A lot of money.
And I'm here to collect it.
I'm just the accountant.
I don't know anything.
You don't need to know anything...
except the combination to the safe.
You do know the combination, yes?
Yes.
Perfect. Please.
- Get in.
- Ah.
STUART:  This is
Hello, my friend. It's Malankov.
I came to your office
to collect my money.
What a disappointment
to see it's not here.
But I am leaving you
something here in return.
As a reminder.
I cannot wait any longer.
My best to the family.
Sweet.
Yeah.
How old?
No matter how old they are, my friend,
they will always be our baby.
Ain't that true? Come on, big guy.
Thank you.
- Whoa!
- BRYAN: Happy birthday!
Dad!
- My birthday's not even for three days.
- You're always saying I'm so predictable.
I wanted to shake things up a bit,
make it a little less predictable.
Sorry.
Come in.
- Champagne glasses?
- KIM: You know me.
Why would I have champagne glasses?
Or a giant stuffed panda?
- I heard that.
-
- Inappropriate, huh?
- Well, I mean...
- not if I was 7.
- I can return it...
or you can hang on to it until you have
a 7-year-old of your own.
- Not funny.
-
- JIMY: Hey, baby. Babe?
- Hey!
- Hey, look who's here.
- Mr. Mills.
Hello, Jimy.
- How are you?
- Good. You?
You know. Hey.
Hi.
Hey, if you guys are having a father-
daughter moment, I can really...
No, no, no. I just dropped by.
I thought I'd do
something unpredictable.
Kim's always pointing out
how predictable I am.
That's funny coming from her.
You wanna talk about predictable?
- I'm not predictable!
- Oh, come on.
Every single day she goes
to the same exact store,
right off campus,
every morning before class...
- and gets the same peach yogurt drink.
- Stop.
The fourth one from the back.
Not the fifth one, not the third one.
The fourth one will stay cold,
but not too cold.
That way, when she's drinking it,
uh... as a snack in between classes...
It's still cold.
I know. I would do
exactly the same thing.
Yeah, the OCD gene.
JIMY:  Uh...
What's with the bubbly?
Uh, pre-birthday celebration.
If you don't mind, I just think
it's a little early to pop open a bottle.
Yeah, no problem.
I'll put it in the fridge.
What's that?
Whoa. A panda.
That was awesome.
I'll leave you two.
Dad, don't...
You don't have to take it.
Now I feel bad.
Yeah, you should feel bad.
I'll exchange it for something
more predictable.
- Love you.
- Take it easy, Jimy.
Bye.
Hey, babe.
- Is something wrong?
- Nothing.
- Are you sure, babe?
- Mmm-hmm.
Stop. Stop.
I just need a second, okay?
You might want to buckle up, Phillip.
Bryan.
How did it go?
Great. Fantastic.
Couldn't have gone better.
The panda was not a hit, I take it.
Careful what you say.
He's sitting right next to me.
When did she grow up, Lenore?
I know. It goes so fast. All of it.
Where are you?
Just going home. Make a little dinner.
- If you'd like to join us.
- "Us"?
Me and the panda.
I'll, uh... take a rain check on that.
If that's okay with you?
And the panda?
That's fine by us.
I'll see you.
See you.
I know what you're thinking.
Keep it to yourself.
Oh, God.
- Hey.
- Lennie.
You changed your mind!
Yeah. Uh, you left the door open.
Come on in.
Okay.
- I'm not intruding?
- No, of course you're not.
I was just preparing dinner. Drink?
Yes, please.
Thanks for coming over.
Cheers.
- You look stressed.
- Yeah.
What?
Stuart and I...
We've tried everything.
Therapy. Counseling.
Together, separately.
He wants it to work. He really does.
And you?
I know I'm hurting him.
I just don't feel anything anymore.
I hate that. I hate not feeling.
I hate going through the motions.
The only thing I feel is trapped.
I have
the worst taste in men!
Thanks.
- Oh, no.
-
No, not you.
Oh, God, I'm sorry.
It's okay.
Do you know what I fantasize about?
I'm afraid to ask.
Us.
- Yeah?
- Mmm-hmm.
And right after...
the guilt comes roaring in
and I feel like such a shit.
Does it make me a bad person...
being married to one man,
fantasizing about another?
Confused maybe. Bad? No.
You must think I'm crazy.
If you are, Lennie,
you're not the only one.
Oh, Lennie.
- I'm sorry.
- No.
It's me that should be apologizing.
It's not that I don't want to.
Believe me.
But until you and Stuart
clear up your situation...
I think it would do more harm than good.
For all of us.
Why do you have
to be so damn honorable?
Believe me, right now, I wish I weren't.
- Uh, I'm gonna go.
- Wait.
Here.
I'm going out of town in a couple
of days for a month on a job.
If you ever feel
you need to go someplace...
just to be by yourself...
use it.
Thank you.
BERNIE: I put on six pounds of muscle.
Oh, you guys are giving me a hard time.
CASEY: Well, it's not
helping your stroke.
BERNIE: You were
plus two on the last one.
You? Me?
- Did the rest of you get on the green?
- SAM: I'm not even on the green.
But seriously, it's money.
It would be fun.
I know. I can't go, Sam.
It's a four-man job.
We can't do it without you.
I know. But a couple
of things have come up...
and I'm not comfortable
being away for a month right now.
- Kim?
- It's not Kim.
- Man, you gotta let this go.
- You do.
Lenore's a grown woman.
She can take care of herself.
You're not her husband any longer.
But she is my friend.
I think you better talk
to somebody about this.
A shrink, maybe.
Why would I go to a shrink
when I got you guys?
-
- There's a good point.
BERNIE: Can somebody
drop the flag stick?
BRYAN: Hey, Kim. What's up?
- You want me to take it out?
- If you wouldn't mind.
Sure. When?
Okay, baby.
SAM: Okay. The big moment.
- BRYAN: That's a good shot.
-
This is an unexpected treat.
Yeah, I, um... need some advice.
Okay, shoot.
Um...
I guess it's not something
I was really planning on...
or even thought about, ever.
Anyway, I just wanted your advice.
- I'm flattered.
-
-
- Whoa.
Poor lady.
That is going to be
serious trouble in a few years.
You mark my words.
What was it you wanted to ask?
KIM: Um...
A puppy.
- A puppy?
- Yeah.
I was thinking about getting a puppy.
- From where?
- Um...
My friend found one
behind her building...
and we were trying to find it a home...
we put it on Facebook,
but nobody claimed it yet, so...
You wanna know what I think?
Yeah.
I mean, it's a lot of work.
It's a lot of responsibility.
With your lifestyle
the way it is at the moment,
with college.
With a puppy you have to be there
all the time and feed it, walk it.
It's no different than having a kid.
Have you had a chance
to look at the menus?
Uh, not yet, Annie.
What will I have?
- Stuart.
- Hey, Bryan.
What are you doing here?
Um...
Everything all right?
Yeah. It's fine.
Can I talk to you inside?
Yeah, yeah, sure.
I was just making some coffee.
Milk? Sugar?
STUART: Um, both, please.
Okay. Milk, cold or hot?
Uh...
Hot, please.
- So, how's business?
- Oh, you know.
Some days good, some days great.
Yeah.
One sugar or two?
Um...
Two, please.
- Here we go.
- Thanks.
Um...
I'm sorry to bother you this late...
but I thought it was more,
um... respectful...
to say what I have to say to you
face-to-face, man-to-man.
So to speak.
I know that Lenore has...
She's spoken to you about the problems
that we've been having.
Um...
You're a good guy, Bryan. I like you.
You're a respectful guy.
And, listen, I'm not
accusing you of anything.
But Lenore and I...
if our marriage
is gonna work...
that can't happen
with you in between us.
But, Stuart...
there's nothing between Lenore and I,
other than we share Kim.
I didn't say there was.
Obviously...
you share a daughter...
and, uh... you've tried to be
the best father that you can,
under the circumstances.
And, uh... part of that
means the two of you
talking and staying in touch.
But I still want you
to stop seeing my wife.
Until we sort things out.
Does she know you're here?
It doesn't matter if she does,
or if she doesn't.
That's not the point.
I'm asking you to stop seeing my wife.
Can you do that?
I can do that.
Wow. That's great.
Thank you.
I gotta go to Vegas tonight.
Some business meeting tomorrow.
I really don't want to be
worrying about...
- you know.
- Yeah.
Thank you.
I really appreciate it.
BRYAN: "Need to see you.
Urgent. Bagels."
Uh, four bagels and some
cream cheese, please.
Okay.
- Be careful. They're really hot.
- Thanks.
- Have a good day. Thanks.
- Take care.
BRYAN: Hello?
- Lennie?
-
Lennie?
Lennie?
Lennie.
Jesus, God.
Lennie? Wake up!
Come on, come on!
- Lennie!
- Freeze! Don't move!
Step away from the knife.
- Get your hands up!
- Sir, back away, now.
I didn't do this.
COP 1: Get your hands up, now!
Slowly.
Get your hands up.
- You gotta listen to me.
- On the floor, now!
Listen to me.
- Down on the floor!
- Listen to me.
- Step away from the knife!
- COP 1: On your knees. Now!
COP 2: Down!
COP 1: Get your hands up!
Hands up!
Hands up! Higher!
BRYAN: I didn't do this.
-
-
COP 3: Shit! Moving in!
COP 4: He's there!
-
-
Hey! Hey!
Drop your weapon!
-
-
COP 5: Oh, he's heading west!
He's heading north.
- Stop!
-
COP 5: Suspect in sight.
COP 4: Go inside. I'm heading back.
Hey!
Hey! Police!
Door's sealed!
- I just saw him inside.
- COP 6: Shit!
Clear! Moving in!
COP 4: You see him anywhere?
He disappeared.
God damn it. He's gone.
This is 103. Suspect is gone.
Yeah.
BRYAN:  Kim, it's Dad.
Where are you?
I'm at Mom's.
Looking for my yellow sweater.
Are you alone?
Stuart is in Vegas. Why?
I have something to tell you.
Dad?
Dad, what's wrong?
Something terrible has happened.
And I want you to hear it from me first.
Your mom...
She's dead.
Someone murdered her...
in my apartment.
It looks like I did it.
I don't know why. I don't know who.
But I'm going to find out.
Listen carefully, Kim.
No matter what anyone says,
don't trust them.
- No.
- You hear?
- I'll find a way to contact you.
- But Dad...
Try to be strong.
- Dad?
- I love you.
Wait.
Sergeant Dotzler,
suspect's name is Bryan Mills.
- His?
- His.
Not his.
The officers arrived
on the scene because...?
Anonymous call came in,
reported a woman screaming...
"He's killing me. He's killing me."
Her name is Lenore St. John.
We sent a car to her address.
It was listed on her license.
Her daughter was there, but her husband
was in Las Vegas on business.
He's, uh... taking the first flight home.
- Any witnesses?
- We're canvassing now.
Call came from an unlisted number.
We're checking out the cells as well.
Download both of the phones,
correlate the data.
I want to know when these two people...
spoke, texted, emailed.
Every form of communication.
Dates, times...
duration of calls.
DOTZLER: Let's bag this.
OFFICER: Detective, bag that.
What's wrong?
Good.
FEMALE REPORTER: Right now,
this is still a very active crime scene.
Investigators have been here
on the scene
all morning, but so far...
police have not told us what happened
inside the apartment...
where earlier this morning...
a woman's body was discovered.
Bryan Mills is the owner
of the apartment...
- and the ex-husband of the deceased.
-
- Who's this?
- BRYAN: It's me.
You're on the news.
I didn't do it, Sam.
Obviously, you didn't do it.
Are you all right?
I'm going down the rabbit hole.
The code still the same?
Yeah. It's still the same.
- I'll be in touch.
- Be careful.
So, this is the area we lost him, sir.
The guy vanished.
Uh, that's the gun that he took, uh... off
one of our officers, sir.
He had a gun, and he didn't fire at you?
No, sir.
And the helicopters...
saw nothing?
Choppers didn't see anything, sir. No.
I know he's good...
but...
vanishing into thin air?
Let's move the truck.
Do you know why your wife
went to visit Mr. Mills?
No, I don't know.
Their relationship
was mostly centered
around their daughter.
Um, but I think...
he wanted more than friendship.
I asked her to speak to him...
and tell him that he should
stop bothering her about it.
So you think that's what
she was doing over there?
I don't know.
What are you doing?
Stuart, why are they going through
all of Mom's stuff?
Hey, Kim.
Miss St. John, Frank Dotzler.
Mills. My name is Mills.
Sorry for all the chaos.
We're just looking around to see
if we can find something to help us.
I know what you're looking for.
I would just really like
them out of her bedroom
for a few minutes.
Garcia, let's vacate the bedroom.
Everybody out of the bedroom.
Thank you.
If I could just have a few minutes
of your time. Ask you a few questions.
Why aren't you out there trying
to find out who did this...
instead of just standing around,
going through our home?
We have people out there looking.
But in order for me
to get a full picture...
I have to ask questions of him.
I have to ask questions of you.
My mom went to see my dad.
I don't know why.
Probably to talk about me.
Look, there's just...
He didn't do it.
He just didn't. He didn't do it.
There's no way on earth he would lay
a hand on her. Just, don't.
He loved her.
That's all I know.
Please.
That's mine. That's not even hers.
Excuse me.
I'm sorry.
Oh, God.
Come on, let's get you home.
If something comes to mind,
anything at all...
It might not be anything.
Um, you know what happened in Paris
and Istanbul a couple years ago
where Bryan saved his family.
Sure. You think
that's connected to this?
I never really wanted
to know all the details...
but a lot of people
ended up dead and now this.
So what you're telling me is...
I'm dealing with a very dangerous man.
No.
No. Bryan's not dangerous.
The world he lives in is.
He loves his family...
but he has a lot of enemies.
I see.
FEMALE DOCTOR:
Bring him into Room Three.
DOTZLER: Garcia will, uh...
get you back home.
Thank you.
DOTZLER: This guy's a ghost.
At 21, he's in the army.
At 23, he joins Special Forces.
Then he's gone.
No service record.
No discharge.
Nothing. Nothing.
Sounds like spy shit to me.
Until we have another suspect,
he's our man.
So here's our best way of finding him.
His daughter with the deceased.
Her husband says that
he's really close to her.
Devoted to her.
So let's keep a close watch on her.
Where she goes, who she calls,
who she talks to.
Let's not screw this up, okay?
So, this is gonna be our best shot
at finding him.
Do we have the deceased's car?
Yeah, that just came in.
They have his, too.
All right. Garcia, Smith.
Let's do a full sweep of the car.
GPS downloaded,
see where he went and when.
See if they correlate.
See if we can find out what's going on.
Just came in, his and hers.
Let's go, then.
Follow me.
IMPOUND TECHNICIAN:
So, what's this about?
GARCIA: Some guy offed his ex.
SMITH: Allegedly.
Right. Allegedly.
- He didn't do her in the car, did he?
- No, in his house.
IMPOUND TECHNICIAN: Good.
I hate going in those after.
Blood. Pieces of flesh and shit.
It's disgusting.
Which GPS you want done first?
His, then hers.
IMPOUND TECHNICIAN: Right over here.
What the hell were you doing
all the way out there, Lenore?
Excuse me.
Inspector Mallory, LAPD.
We're following up on a missing
persons investigation.
I was wondering
if you'd seen this woman.
Nope.
She was here about 10 p.m. last night.
I was here then.
I didn't see her.
I didn't see hardly nobody.
Not exactly a bustling destination,
if you know what I mean.
MAN: Hey, Sally.
WAITRESS: Excuse me.
Duty calls.
WAITRESS: Amanda?
Excuse me.
Inspector Mallory, LAPD.
Are these security cameras operative
or are they just there for show?
Yeah, they work.
Follow me.
You have the tape from yesterday?
I wasn't here. The other guy was.
But if someone was here,
it will be on there.
Just push that button for the playback.
I'm just gonna stay here
while you look at that.
You have problems with this system?
MAN: Breaks down sometimes.
They keep saying
they're gonna replace it.
GARCIA: Excuse me.
Have you seen this woman?
You fellas should get more coordinated.
Coordinated? What do you mean?
Like, color-coordinated?
No, like, one of your guys
was just in here asking the same thing.
- One of our guys?
- Yeah.
- Him?
- Yeah. Him.
Took off to the gas station.
Shh.
Freeze!
Mr. Mills?
Freeze!
- GARCIA: Step out, buddy.
- SMITH: Get out of the room.
GARCIA: Freeze!
Stop what you're doing, Mr. Mills!
Step away from the desk!
SMITH: Back away from the desk, sir.
Step away from that desk,
or I'll shoot you!
SMITH: Back away from the goddamn desk!
Now!
Step away one step from the desk.
Just keep your hands
where we can see them.
Stay perfectly still.
SMITH: You know the drill.
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.
You have the right to an attorney...
to have one present during questioning.
Brooks. All right.
BROOKS: Garcia and Smith.
They got him.
- Garcia.
- Yeah, just picked him up.
Easy-peasy.
If he's a pro like you said...
he wasn't on his game today.
- He's playing you!
- What are you talking about?
Where is he? Where is he?
He's back in Phillips' car. Why?
- Stop the cars!
- What?
Stop the cars!
Now!
SMITH: Oh, come on!
- Phillips.
- Yeah?
GARCIA:  Our boss has got
a hair up his ass about something.
Just keep an eye on this guy, all right?
Yeah, okay.
- JOHNSON: They think we're idiots.
- PHILLIPS: It's unbelievable.
He acts like I've never
done this before.
He's just being Dotzler.
You know what it is?
He's a control freak.
If he's not doing it himself,
he's not happy.
-
-
Keep driving!
Phillips!
Come on.
What the hell is he doing?
Pull it over!
Back it up!
Get out of the car!
Drive!
Stop the car.
Come on, move.
Radio.
Cell phone.
This is gonna end bad for you.
Don't be such a pessimist.
FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE:
Connecting to LAPD protected files.
PILOT:
All units, code 10-29
on a police car number 706.
Number 706.
OFFICER: Suspect in sight.
Here, here!
Send some backup, now!
Dotzler.
By now, I'm sure you know who I am.
You know what I'm capable of.
I am beginning to.
Let me ask you something,
just so I'm clear.
CIA operative?
Division 6? Division 7? What?
All you have to know is I'm innocent.
Give me two days, I can prove it.
I can find out who did it.
You may very well
be innocent, Mr. Mills.
But that's the court's job
to decide, it's not mine.
My job...
is to bring you in and let the law
take its course, that's it.
- Good luck.
-
I got a GPS on the phone.
He's heading north.
You want me to send units?
Don't bother. He's gone.
- It's a dead end.
- Wait, wait.
Why does he want us to have this?
- He fucked up.
- This guy doesn't fuck up.
He wants us to watch it.
GARCIA: Why?
I don't know yet.
Who is she waiting for?
Who are these guys?
- Holy shit!
- Who are these guys?
Give me our tech guy.
I need some magic done
on a security tape.
Now. Right now.
SAM: Hey, let me guess.
Pileup on the 710 North.
Massive clusterfuck
of police vehicles...
Sounds about right.
Hey, thanks, Sam.
You want to tell me what's going on?
Lenore sent me a text.
Asked to come over
to my place for bagels.
I got the bagels.
When I came back,
I found her car out front.
Um...
She was in my bed
with her throat slashed.
Oh, Jesus.
What else?
I found a location on her car's GPS
from the night before.
She was out at this gas station
in the middle of nowhere.
I saw it on a security camera.
She was snatched.
What do you want us to do?
I downloaded all her phone records
from the police files. And mine.
Maybe there's something there.
I need analysis of this.
Her hair. Might turn up something,
might turn up nothing.
Anything else?
I want to go to the funeral.
PASTOR: The Bible constantly tells us...
that there will be
difficult times in life...
when we feel like we are walking...
through a dark, dangerous valley.
Valley of the shadow of death.
But what the word of God
does make very clear...
is that, as we move
through such times...
"the Lord is my shepherd.
"He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.
"He leadeth me beside still waters."
In the name of the Father...
and of the Son...
and of the Holy Spirit.
CASEY: Are you holding up?
- Right there.
- MAN: Mmm-hmm.
Get me sound on that. Right there.
Kim, I'm so sorry.
If there's anything we can do...
Hey.
BERNIE: We're there for you.
- You know that, right?
- KIM: Mmm-hmm.
- Hey, baby.
- Hey.
KIM: I just want to go home.
-
-
You hear that?
You hear that click?
Yeah. We're getting some
interference somewhere.
There it goes again.
- KIM: Hey.
- Hi.
Oh, sweetie.
They're jamming our signal.
I know. I know.
I'm so, so sorry.
Listen.
He'll be in touch.
Just stick to your schedule.
Your very predictable schedule.
You want me to put a tail on them?
No, it's a waste of time.
It'd be a waste of our money.
These guys could lose a tail
if it was attached to a dog.
We're done.
Cut the feed.
Stuart, why are there still...
Why are there still cops camped outside?
Uh, I think it's standard
operating procedure.
They think my dad's going to show up here?
Are they stupid or something?
I don't know what they think.
Inspector Dotzler asked
if we minded and I said no.
You should have asked me. I mind.
I'm sorry.
And who's he?
STUART: Well, um...
We need protection.
Kim, honey,
I know it's hard on you,
but it's hard on me, too.
I'm sorry. I didn't realize
it was a competition.
It's not a competition.
Please, don't hate me.
I'm not responsible for what happened.
I don't hate you, Stuart.
But for the last two years...
every time I looked
into my mom's eyes...
the only thing I saw
was hurt and sadness.
And for that...
I do hold you responsible.
- Where are you going?
- School.
If I'm allowed.
-
-
I got you, baby. I got you.
Hmm.
- Why are you following me?
- It's for your own protection, miss.
Protection? From who? My father?
You really think
my father would hurt me?
Your mother probably
didn't think so either.
Asshole.
- Hey.
- MAN: Hey.
Anything?
GARCIA: She's on campus.
You want me to follow?
Is the bug active?
- Yes.
- Okay. Stay there. Listen.
If he shows up, we'll hear it.
- What else?
- She went into this convenience store,
chugged down a drink of some kind...
- right from the fridge.
- All right.
Keep me informed.
PROFESSOR: As you might remember,
last week we discussed disassociations...
and interactions between dorsal
and ventral streams...
in object recognition.
- Now, a dominant hypothesis...
-
is that the dorsal stream is supporting
motor interactions with objects.
While ventral stream structures extract
visual information...
about the object that is independent.
I'm feeling a little nauseous.
Would you mind taking notes for me?
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks.
PROFESSOR: Now, in other words,
object knowledge
is represented in the ventral stream...
Excuse me. I wonder if you could,
um... help me out with something?
- Sure.
- There was a young woman in here...
- about an hour ago?
- Oh, yeah. Poor kid.
- Does she come here often?
- Every day.
- She bought what?
- Same thing, a peach yogurt drink.
But today, she drank it
all right there from the fridge.
Must have been thirsty.
You got anything?
GARCIA:  Yeah, she went
to school. Got nauseous in class.
Now she's on her way to the bathroom.
Call for back-up.
I'm coming right now.
-
-
Shh!
-
-
Shh.
Here, Kim. Drink this.
I put something in the yogurt
to make you nauseous.
This will take it away.
Hi, baby.
Hi.
- Oh, Kim. Kim.
-
Oh, Kim.
Daddy. I don't know what to do.
I'm pregnant.
What?
I'm pregnant.
Dad?
I'm okay.
I have low blood sugar.
I haven't eaten since yesterday.
Um...
Eat this.
Don't you worry.
Let's get through this first and then...
we'll figure out what's best for...
What you have to do is act natural.
This cop is really smart.
Anything out of the usual...
he'll become suspicious. Okay?
I love you.
I love you, too.
- GARCIA:  Yes.
- Where are you?
I'm in the science building. East wing.
- She's in the bathroom.
- Don't move. Wait for me.
Where are you staying?
I'm still at Mom's.
I started packing her stuff.
It doesn't feel real.
Oh, I know.
I know.
Dad, there's...
Stuart's been acting really weird.
He must be scared about something.
He hired bodyguards.
-
-
- GIRL 1: Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.
It was so much fun. But you know what?
- He was such a jerk.
- GIRL 1: Really?
GIRL 2: He made me pay
for my own drink at the bar.
I was wearing something
more skimpy than this.
- More skimpy than that?
- I don't know what was happening.
GIRL 1: Maybe he's blind. I don't know.
GIRL 2: I don't know.
- GIRL 2: He is such a jerk.
- I'm not gonna do it again, though.
GIRL 1: No, it's cool, I've seen him.
I completely understand.
GIRL 2: He's hot, right?
- GIRL 2: Go, go, go!
- GIRL 1: I'm going!
GIRL 2: Go, go, go.
-
- What the...?
Excuse me?
Perv!
He just left.
She's in the can.
I can't let you leave.
Seal all the areas.
Hey!
There he is.
Down the south corridor!
Freeze!
Go, go, go!
Move!
MAN 1: Just move! Come on!
MAN 2: This way! Move, move!
I know you think you're helping him...
but you're not.
You're not.
Unless we get him to come in...
I can't start trying to make sense
of what happened.
Someone killed my mom.
That's what happened.
It was not my father.
Without hearing his side of the story,
they can't know that, can they?
I do.
Is there anything else?
You know we can arrest you
for obstructing
an ongoing investigation?
Arrest me.
Rather not.
Well, then, if you're not going to,
can I go home?
Of course. Of course.
Thank you.
Interesting family.
MALANKOV:  Don't worry,
we will take care of this.
Do as we planned.
Call the car.
BODYGUARD: Where are we going, boss?
STUART: The Malibu house.
Okay, let's go get drunk.
-
-
I'm not gonna hurt you.
I need a ride. Mind if I drive?
Okay.
What's your name?
Mike.
I'm Bryan. You have kids, Mike?
- Yeah, two.
- Uh-huh.
- How old?
- Owen is three, and Tori is seven.
Great age.
A piece of advice.
Don't miss a day of it.
Before you know it,
they'll be having kids of their own.
Know what I mean?
BRYAN: Thanks, Mike.
- Uh-huh.
- You know, if you stand in a field
with a book of matches...
you can have hundreds
of rabbits in seconds...
like this.
- You know how?
- No.
Come in, all rabbits.
Come in, all rabbits. You like this?
-
-
-
-
Who hired you?
Huh?
Who are you working for?
Your accent is shit!
Who are you working for?
I'd rather die than tell you.
Scumbag!
-
-
Boss? They're at the gate.
Let them in.
Oh, and take a stroll.
I need a little privacy.
-
-
Many?
Many?
Oh!
Bryan?
None of this
is making sense to me, Stuart.
I was hoping you could help me out.
How did you...
Survive the crash?
The Russians who were following me
when I was following you...
do they work for you, Stuart?
No. I don't know
what you're talking about.
What do you know?
The only thing I know is that
you were fucking my wife.
And I know that she's dead!
No, no, no!
What do you know?
I don't know anything.
I swear. I don't know anything.
- If I believed that, we wouldn't be here.
- No! No! No!
Malankov, Malankov, Malankov!
What?
Malankov.
Oleg Malankov.
Who is Oleg Malankov?
I owe him money.
You don't know him.
He'll never give up.
It's only a game for him.
I lost everything.
He said he'd kill my family.
Why didn't you tell this to the police?
You let them think it was me.
I was angry with you.
God damn it, you promised!
- You promised to stop seeing her!
- So what do you think happened?
She came over to my place.
This Malankov followed her there?
If you weren't seeing her
behind my back...
she wouldn't have been there
in the first place, would she?
They would have killed her
someplace else.
So why are they coming after me?
Because I told them who you were.
That you would find them and kill them.
How convenient would that be for you?
I kill them, your debt is cancelled.
I'm sorry, Bryan.
But I loved her. You gotta believe me.
I loved her! I loved her!
Here's what you're gonna do.
You're gonna go to the police
and tell them everything.
I can't.
I can't. He's crazy. You don't know him.
You can do whatever the hell
you want. Either way...
I'm a dead man.
I'm dead.
They kill you, they don't get paid.
You're not the one
they're gonna come after next.
Kim.
SAM: Hey.
Can I get your keys, please?
Do you know what you're getting
yourself into, man?
Yeah. As a matter of fact, I do.
Could I get your keys
and your phone, please?
BERNIE: You mind putting your hands
on the steering wheel?
Or what? What are
you gonna do? Shoot me?
Left or right?
Go ahead, put the cuffs on.
Thank you very much.
-
-
-
-
Dad!
Let's go, Kim.
What's going on?
We're keeping you safe.
KIM: Sam?
Hey, Kim. We're gonna get in the truck.
CASEY: Hi, Kim.
Let's go.
DOTZLER: Bernard Harris.
He's a trained sniper.
Left the army at 24.
Nothing, nothing after that.
Nothing until he registers
as one of three founders
of something called
Private Securities International.
The other two being, Casey Mark,
Navy SEAL, eight years' service.
"Explosives expert." It's right there.
Next time we hear from him, he's 45
and Senior Vice President
of Private Securities International.
Sam Grossman, communications expert,
a wizard,
and he's the COO of Private
Securities International.
Now, our primary person of interest...
Bryan Mills.
Is listed as an "employee" of Private...
You get the picture.
These are very serious people.
If you don't bring your A-game,
they're gonna run around you,
through you, under you.
I need it to stop right now.
There's one more thing. This.
The Russian, he killed himself.
Probably because he didn't
wanna give up the information
that Mills was asking him for.
Because obviously,
he's not trying to kill you.
Obviously, he's not
trying to kill anybody.
He's only trying to get information.
He's only trying to figure this out,
just like we are.
Except for the fact
that he is a step ahead of us.
I'd like to know the relationship
between the Russians
and the wife's murder.
One of these four people,
they know something about it.
They know the answer.
I need you guys to find them.
I need you to bring them in.
- BRYAN: Anything yet?
- SAM: No.
Nothing came up
from the samples you gave me.
But this is gonna take
a while to sort through.
Bryan, there's a shitload of data here.
STUART: What is that?
I downloaded the police computers.
- For what?
- BRYAN: The first thing they're gonna look at...
are the phone records to see
if there are any clues.
Mine and Lenore's.
What's it gonna tell you, that you
and Lenore spoke to each other?
You know what? Don't worry about it.
We're almost done here anyway.
So, what's the plan?
The plan is to make sure
my daughter is safe.
And the only way
to do that, so it seems...
is to eliminate the thing
that will make her unsafe.
Malankov.
Good one, Stuart.
I'd like to help.
CASEY: Oh, you're gonna help, all right.
Like bait helps to catch a shark.
Excuse me?
BRYAN: Start talking about Malankov.
I want to know every detail.
Who he is, what he does,
where he lives...
where he works.
Oleg Malankov.
He's as tough as they come.
He served in the Russian Army
when they invaded Afghanistan.
He was Spetsnaz.
It's like our Navy SEALS.
After the collapse of the Soviet Union,
when everyone was
grabbing what they could...
there was a real demand
for men with his kind of skills.
He became one of the grabbers.
STUART: I met him when I was doing
a deal involving heavy machinery.
Since then, we did business
on a number of different occasions.
Some deals worked out.
I don't have the money.
Last one didn't.
What?
My mom is dead because of one
of your shitty business deals?
No.
Kim, that's not what happened.
Fuck you!
- I'll fucking kill you!
- Kim.
BRYAN: We need him.
We need him.
Call him.
Why?
Because you're gonna set him up for me.
Make the call. Now.
On speaker.
Pow.
Stuart. I've missed you.
I have your money.
You have it?
That was fast.
How can I trust you?
You can trust me.
Where do you want me to bring it?
Meet me at the building downtown.
In one hour.
- Sure, one hour.
-
Scumbag!
Tell me how his security works.
STUART: Malankov works out
of his penthouse apartment.
He has a private elevator
with two bodyguards.
Malankov is coming. Send the elevator.
STUART: The elevator is controlled
by security upstairs.
Once they see who's inside
the elevator and give the okay...
they will send the elevator up.
STUART: Outside the elevator,
upstairs...
is a security station
and three more bodyguards.
Two sets of doors.
Through the second set of doors
is Malankov's private apartment.
SAM: Can you help me out, here?
I got an address but I don't have a name.
- I got a back full of perishables.
- Go to the first floor and ask for the desk.
- First floor. Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.
Hello, sir.
STUART: I'm here to see Oleg Malankov.
Okay, sir, have a good day.
Thanks.
BRYAN: Get out.
It's Dotzler.
Answer it. Act normal.
Don't try anything smart.
- Hello?
- DOTZLER: Mr. St. John?
Frank Dotzler.
Where are you?
Um, I'm in a business meeting.
Is there anything wrong?
Bryan Mills removed your stepdaughter
from your home.
I'm there right now.
STUART: Oh, my God. That's, um...
- When are you coming home?
- I'm leaving immediately.
It should take me about an hour
to get there from where I am.
- Where exactly is that?
- Malibu.
Listen, Inspector,
I don't think he means her any harm.
Mr. St. John, this man
is the prime suspect
in the murder of your wife.
His associates held guns on my men
in the front of your home.
As far as I'm concerned, he is dangerous
and has to be taken into custody.
So, if you'd like,
I can send a car for you,
but I need you somewhere safe.
No, no, no. It's fine.
I'm leaving right now.
I'll be waiting for you.
Get me a location on St. John's phone.
SAM: As soon as he finds out
you're not in Malibu,
he'll be headed right here.
I'd say we have
less than 30 minutes
to do this before he shows up.
It's enough time for me.
Can you handle this, Kim?
What do I have to do?
Just keep me up to date
on what comes up.
Thanks, Sam.
Inspector, the tape you gave us
from that gas station...
here are the stills, frame by frame.
GARCIA: Hey.
He lied to you about where he was.
- What a surprise.
- He's downtown.
Let's call out the cavalry.
All right.
We're out of this location!
We're on the move! Let's go!
They're gone.
Okay. Cops on the move.
Okay. Let's go.
You do exactly as you were told.
Don't improvise.
Try anything funny,
and they'll kill you.
And if they don't, I will.
I don't know how many times
I can say sorry.
Come here, Kim.
There.
Dotzler.
I found out something
you might wanna know.
Matching insurance policies
on St. John and his wife.
$12 million. Each.
How about that?
Stuart St. John.
Mr. Malankov's expecting me.
MAN: What's in the bag?
We're in.
Okay.
Stuart St. John is clear.
Unlock the elevator.
-
-
Okay.
Got him.
- Go! All right.
-
What's going on?
Everything okay?
MAN 2: Mmm-hmm.
Call the elevator.
-
-
Get back to the truck.
Bingo.
Right on.
-
- Mmm.
He's coming up.
Go, go, go.
Showtime. Bingo.
What the hell's going on?
-
-
Guys?
Go check it out.
-
-
Get up.
Get up!
Who are you, old man?
You killed my ex-wife.
But you're not gonna kill my daughter.
Your daughter?
Shit!
We are fucked by the same man.
What are you talking about?
Stuart St. John.
First, he gets me to kill your wife...
then you.
And when that doesn't work...
he pushes you to kill me, no?
Either way, he wins.
Your wife was just
part of a business deal...
like many before her.
It is my turn to lose the game.
Finish me!
Finish me.
I deserve it.
Yes.
You do.
Dad?
Listen.
- Dad?
- SAM: What is it, Kim?
- No!
- Ahhh!
Sam! Sam!
Kim.
Come on. Let's go.
- STUART: Come on. Move.
- Kim!
Get in the car!
Let's go, come on!
Where are we going?
Get in the car.
-
-
He's still alive.
Let's get a medic in here...
SMITH:  ASAP! Medic!
Inspector!
- SMITH: Yeah?
- The elevator!
Dotzler, it's Smith.
We're in Malankov's building.
- I think, uh... Mills is here.
- Really?
Yeah. We're gonna check
the apartment now.
Shit!
Hey! Can you move?
Back it up. Back it up.
All right, let's go. Everybody in.
Come on! Let's go!
This guy's still warm. We got a good chance
he's still in the building.
Call downstairs, lock it up.
Nobody in, nobody out.
COP: Lock it up. Nobody in, nobody out.
-
-
BRYAN: "Text from your phone
asking Mom to meet you...
"at the Rancho Berrego
the night she died.
"Someone used your phone?"
Call Dotzler!
WOMAN:
Santa Monica Aviation.
This is Mr. St. John.
I'll be there in 15 minutes.
Get the plane ready.
It'll be ready.
Why are you doing this?
Because your father and his friends
are homicidal maniacs.
- You're a lying piece of shit.
- Shut up.
You killed her! I know...
You shut up!
Shut up!
Brooks.
I want the full work-up on a black Porsche,
license plate number 6-8-9-M-J-C-6.
Okay.
Connect me to the Porsche phone
and trace it.
All right.
I need a run on a California plate
I need a phone, too.
Pick up the phone.
PILOT: Black Porsche's
phone position received.
Heading west.
-
- Yes?
Listen, Mr. Mills.
It's Dotzler.
I've started to piece
this thing together.
There's two life insurance policies.
One for St. John, one for your ex-wife.
You understand?
Stuart owed money to these Russians.
A lot of it.
The ones who abducted her.
Then they took her to my place
and killed her to
keep me out of the way.
I need you to step back...
and allow me to handle this.
I got it.
What's your first
priority here, Inspector?
To arrest St. John
and charge him
with your ex-wife's murder.
My first priority is my daughter.
Get out of the car.
Come on, let's go.
Go!
Okay, we're leaving now.
Come on, let's go.
PILOT 1: Yes, sir!
PILOT: Approaching Runway Two.
Ready for takeoff.
Come on, guys. Let's go.
PILOT: Requesting
permission for takeoff.
HELICOPTER PILOT:
We got a visual on the Porsche.
He's heading to Santa Monica airport.
I want all units in the area
of the Santa Monica airport...
to be on the lookout
for a black Porsche.
No.
Let's go!
- Come on!
- PILOT 1: We don't have enough speed!
Let's go!
STUART: Give me the goddamn gun!
Give me the goddamn gun!
-
- I'll shoot you in the head!
Shut up!
Very smart...
playing me off against the Russian.
Coming over for coffee.
Taking my phone,
sending texts and then erasing them.
So that your pals...
could plant Lenore's body...
and make it look as if I killed her.
All your problems solved.
All your worries over.
But it didn't quite work out that way.
STUART: Oh, listen, Bryan.
They're coming.
You can't kill me now.
- Oh, yeah?
-
Dad...
I know you know a lot of people...
and with a good lawyer,
you'll get out of jail in a few years.
And then I'll come for you.
I'll find you.
And we both know what's gonna happen.
DOTZLER: I knew from the beginning.
It was the bagels.
They were warm.
I had to ask myself...
what kind of guy
goes out for warm bagels...
and comes back and commits murder?
So, I compared the timestamps
to the deleted texts...
that you downloaded from our computers.
Which, by the way, is illegal,
and I could arrest you for it.
I could. But it's got me.
And I was able to figure it out.
She was leaving him.
He needed the insurance money
to pay Malankov.
You didn't help us out
by escaping, you know.
He figured, what better way
to get rid of Malankov
and keep the insurance money...
than by getting me
to kill the guy who would kill him...
because it was the only way
to keep my daughter safe.
Almost worked.
Almost.
So, are we done, Inspector?
Of course.
Of course we're done.
We're done.
Could you, um... just stay in town
for the next month or so...
just in case I have any
other questions for you?
Sure.
BRYAN: Now, you two.
I've thought about this all night.
It's a very important choice.
Whatever you decide...
the two of you, together...
I'll support you 100%.
And I know your mom would
have said the same thing, too.
- Tell him.
- Dad...
we've been talking.
We thought that...
if it's a girl...
we'd like to name her after mom.
She'd like that very much, Kim.
Hot nights coming
Keep the car running
Lavender fingers
Swallow my pollen
Gold, I swam into your spell
On the rite of God we fell
You were plush and I laid bare
You had me howling
Cold, I fell into your skin
On the night you led me under your sin
You had me howling
You had me howling
Golden siren
Under-exposing
Come lay your weakness down
On the floor in the backseat
Gold, I swam into your spell
On the rite of God we fell
You were plush and I laid bare
You had me howling
Cold, I fell into your skin
On the night you led me under your sin
You had me howling
You had me howling
