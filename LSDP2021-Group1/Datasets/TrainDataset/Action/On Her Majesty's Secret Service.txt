I've been saying for years, sir,
that our equipment is obsolete.
And now computer analysis reveals an
entirely new approach: miniaturisation.
the antipersonnel and
location fix seems obvious.
Number Ten's making ugly noises
about Operation Bedlam.
Miss Moneypenny,
did you check with Communications?
Replies to our Cairo
and Madrid enquiries: all negative, sir.
The PM wants to be informed
personally when we find 007.
No!
Good morning!
My name's Bond. James Bond.
Don't move, Mr Bond.
- Your bagages, sir?
- In the boot.
- Take care of those gloves.
- Right, sir.
- Commander Bond, how are you?
- Fine. Good to see you, Manuel.
Everything seems up to
the Palécio's standards.
That red Cougar outside.
Does it belong to a lady?
Yes, sir. Contessa Teresa di Vicenzo.
Che bellal
I'm sure we can look after
your special needs.
- Banco.
- Les jeux sont faits, monsieur.
- Cartes.
- Cartes.
- Vfngt mille-
- La banque vingt mille- Give the bank
- La banque a vingt mille
-20,000 francs!
- La banque a vingt mille
- Too rich for my blood.
- Vingt mi/le, la banque.
Banco.
- Madame?
I don't have the money.
- Je regrette, mais c'est impossible.
- I regret too, but I don't have any money.
- Dame can't pay up.
- OK, madame, venez avec moi.
- S'il vous plait, madame?
- Forgive me. My mind was elsewhere.
Madame has forgotten
we agreed to be partners this evening.
- Please continue.
- Merci.
Well, that's a bit of luck, being bailed out
like that at the last minute!
- Dom Pérignon '57.
- Sir.
Why do you persist
in rescuing me, Mr Bond?
It's becoming a habit,
isn't it, Contessa Teresa?
Well, Tracy, next time
play it safe and stand on five.
- Send it to suite 423 with caviar for two.
- Oui, monsieur.
- You're full of surprises, Contessa.
- So are you, Mr Bond.
Do you always arm yourself
for a rendezvous?
Occasionally. I seem
to be accident-prone.
You're very sure of yourself, aren't you?
Suppose I were to kill you for a thrill.
I can think of something
more sociable to do.
Will you stop playing games?
Who was that man in your room?
- You're hurting me.
- I thought that was the idea.
- Who was he?
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- I can be a lot more persuasive.
- I'm sure you can.
You're the most extraordinary girl.
I'm not interested
in your opinion of me, Mr Bond.
- I'm here for a business transaction.
- Really?
So, you know your perfumes.
What else do you know?
The only thing you need know about me
is that I pay my debts.
Good morning.
- Morning. Café for two with orange juice.
- Yes, sir.
- Connect me with suite 423, please.
- The Countess has left the hotel, sir.
- Checked out?
- A few minutes ago.
- Mr Bond?
- Yes.
- You've lost something.
- Really?
Why not? Perhaps
we can make up a foursome!
You've thought of everything. What a
lovely surprise, meeting again so soon!
- Mm.
- Thank you.
- And where's the party this time?
- You have an appointment.
Do not kill me, Mr Bond.
At least not until we've had a drink.
Then if you wish,
I'll give you another chance.
- But today is the 13th, Commander.
- I'm superstitious.
- A martini for our guest, Olympe.
- A pleasure.
- Shaken, not stirred.
- Of course.
- Campari for me.
- Mm-hm.
My apologies for the way you were
brought here today. Please sit down.
I was not sure
you would accept a formal invitation.
There's always something formal
about the point of a pistol.
- Olympe, we will finish our struggle later.
- As you wish.
She also plays
a very good game of chess.
- Salute.
- Cheers.
Marc Ange Draco. Head of Union Corse,
one of Europe's biggest crime syndicates.
- The biggest.
- Not quite.
An organisation known as SPECTRE
operates worldwide.
However, your legitimate business fronts
are more extensive.
Construction, electrical supplies,
numerous agricultural holdings.
Your dossier on me
- Tracy?
- Yes, Tracy. Tracy.
Her mother was an English girl-
romantic -
who had come to Corsica
to look for bandits.
Rather like those women who ventured
into the desert looking for sheikhs.
Twelve years later my wife died.
I sent Teresa to Switzerland
- No, thanks. I prefer my own.
-to finish her education.
Unfortunately I didn't give her a proper
home. She was without supervision.
she joined the fast international set.
One scandal after another.
When I disapproved,
cut off her allowance,
Yet, behind her bravado,
something was eating away at her soul.
They burn the heart out of themselves
by living too greedily.
-all is finished.
- Why are you telling me this?
Without telling me, she married. An Italian
count who killed himself in a Maserati
I gave her too much,
and it brought her nothing.
I have been informed of everything
you have done for my daughter.
- Everything?
- Don't worry, don't worry about that.
What you did, the way you behaved,
might be the beginning
I find her fascinating,
but she needs a psychiatrist, not me.
To make love to her enough
to make her love him.
She's very attractive,
but what you ask is not for me.
I'll give you a personal dowry
of one million pounds
- But I don't need a million pounds.
- Stupido!
I'm sorry, Draco,
but in my profession, I can't...
- What?
- You have connections not open to me.
Some of my men
have recently defected to him.
- I don't know where he is.
- Can you find out?
If I could, I wouldn't tell
Her Majesty's Secret Service.
For that,
Teresa always comes back to me.
- You understand?
- Let's say I'll sleep on the idea.
- James! Where have you been?
- Much too far from you, darling.
Heartless brute! Letting me pine away
without even a postcard.
Cocktails at my place,
eightish, just the two of us.
Same old Moneypenny.
Britain's last line of defence.
You'd better go in.
He's running a very tight ship today.
I'm relieving you
from Operation Bedlam, 007.
But, sir, Blofeld's
something of a must with me.
- Have you lost confidence in me?
- I'm well aware of your talents, 007.
But a license to kill is useless,
unless one can set up the target.
- Sir...
- I'll find you a more suitable assignment.
- Under the circumstances...
- That's all!
- How can a girl keep herself alluring...
- Take a memo, please, Moneypenny.
Sir, I have the honour to request
if you'll accept my resignation
- Resignation from what?
- Her Majesty's Secret Service.
And kindly present it
to that monument in there.
Underneath de mango tree
Me honey and me
come watch for de moon...
-007... James Bond here.
- He wants you, James.
Well, you didn't really
want to resign, did you?
Moneypenny,
what would I do without you?
My problem is that
you never do anything with me.
- Where are you off to?
- Oh, just some place to laze about.
What would I do without you,
Miss Moneypenny? Thank you.
Teresa!
It's so long since we see you!
- Yes, very well.
- There's Tracy.
- Huh?
- Tracy.
- Teresa!
- Happy birthday, Papa.
You make it so by being here.
You look marvellous.
- Salut, Olympe. How are you?
- It's good to have you back.
- You look wonderful!
- Thanks.
Mr Bond, may I introduce
my daughter? Teresa.
- We've already met.
- But each time is a renewed pleasure.
Madame always makes one feel
so welcome!
You must give me
the name of your oculist.
There are many things
about Mr Bond one does not know.
It would be interesting
to attend night school perhaps.
Whatever he may arrange,
I know it's for your happiness.
- Thank you.
- Many happy returns.
The best years
are still to come, let's hope.
Yes, wasn't it kind
of your father to invite me?
- Really?
- Mm-hm.
No woman would waste excellent
champagne discussing business.
Unless, of course, she happened
to be part of the arrangement.
Don't blame Olympe.
I'm not your daughter for nothing.
I suggest you revise the terms
of your contract, Mr Bond.
- You'll find your liability too expensive.
- There you're mistaken.
'Papa.
- Yes?
- Mr Bond wants information.
- What are you talking about?
You always taught me
a good host supplies his guest's needs.
- Uh-huh.
- And without obligation.
- And then?
- I'm not sure obligation is the right word.
- Now!
- Please, please, Teresa.
Tell him, Papa,
or you'll never see me again.
There may be a connection between
that man Blofeld and the lawyer
- Named Gumbold.
- Gumbold?
- Bern, Switzerland?
- Yes, Gumbold.
So, now Mr Bond need have
no further interest in me.
I was always taught
that mistakes should be remedied.
We have all the time
I'll see to this appointment,
then catch up with you.
- The story of our life, James?
- Just keep my martini cool.
- I will be back in an hour.
- Bon appétit, monsieur.
Such things should be left to a girl's
father, who knows what is best for her.
Tomorrow I will speak to him alone,
man to man.
- No, Papa.
- Why not?
No talk. Whatever happens,
there'll be no regrets.
- Afternoon. ls the Admiral in?
- Certainly.
- Hm?
- Right, show him in.
- Aye aye, sir.
- If you please, sir.
- Thank you.
Unusually small
for a Nymphalis polychloris.
I wasn't aware that your expertise
included lepidoptery.
Came across a letter from Gebrﬂder
Gumbold, solicitors in Switzerland
to a certain
Count Balthazar de Bleuchamp.
- De Bleuchamp?
- French form of "Blofeld".
You've been relieved from
Operation Bedlam, 007. Remember?
to our College of Arms
in the City of London
with the request they try to establish
de Bleuchamp's claim to the title,
and Sir Hilary Bray
has replied to Gumbold
suggesting that he should meet
de Bleuchamp in person.
I've taken the liberty, sir,
of working with the college on this,
using an examination
of my own family tree as cover.
I've also been reading up
on the technical side of heraldry.
So that, should he consent to meet, I can
act as a representative of the college.
Come.
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon, Sir Hilary.
Have a look at this: arms of Sir Thomas
Bond. Baronet of Peckham. Died 1734.
Good motto, eh?
"The world is not enough."
- You're doing a splendid job.
- Thank you, Mr Sable Basilisk.
We've traced your line
back to Sir Otho le Bon.
Held the manor of Wickhambreux by a
knight's fee from the Earl of Thanet, 1387.
Gumbold's telephoned from Bern
to say his client has consented to see me.
- You mean me?
- Yes, you.
But, Commander Bond, I am only able
to countenance this deception
I haven't exaggerated.
We appreciate your help.
All right, then. I've arranged to lose myself
amongst the churches of Brittany.
- Where do I go for this meeting?
- Well, they want a description of myself.
- Tactfully adjusted to favour me.
- Yes.
They will send the time and place
from where I am to be
It's not our sort of thing,
but under the circumstances...
- Sounds as if they're suspicious.
- No, no, no, not suspicious. Just discreet.
There was no objection to my fee
of a thousand guineas.
- Could their claim be genuine?
- Hard to say. Our methods are exacting.
We never speak until we're absolutely
certain there's no error on our side or
-forgery on anybody else's.
- I hope I live up to your high standards.
One helpful physical point may be that the
real de Bleuchamps are without ear lobes.
It's not the sort of thing we rely on,
but it could help.
- No ear lobes.
- Invite him to Augsburg.
The de Bleuchamps have been
coming from there for generations.
Yes, I'd like to get him
away from Switzerland.
- Sir Hilary Bray, Baronet?
- The same, dear lady.
I'm Fréulein Irma Bunt,
personal secretary to the Count.
- Have you had a good journey?
- No, intolerable. I'm not a good traveller.
- Grunther will take your luggage.
- I can manage.
- I take it.
- Oh, very well.
- I'm afraid not, Fréulein...
- Bunt.
Bunt. Interesting name for a genealogist.
Are you from a naval family?
It's a nautical term, you see, meaning
the baggy or swollen parts of a sail.
- Nothing personal, of course.
- Interesting.
- You speak German?
- I'm afraid not.
- French?
- A little. Where are we off to?
- You are comfortable?
- Yes, indeed, Fréulein.
- Your kindness is quite overwhelming.
- Good.
Hup! KQn7rn!
- I've never been in one of these before.
- You must your pipe knock off.
Mind your head, Sir Hilary.
- Please fasten your safety belt.
You enjoy the skiing
or the bobsleigh perhaps?
Up to there is for the public, and
from here upwards it is strictly private.
may come through
without permission from the Count.
There is the Bleuchamp Institute
for allergy research.
- What kind of allergies?
- All of them.
Like the hay fever,
or the sickness caused by the oysters,
- I'll be glad to get my feet on the ground
- Not ground. Ice.
Fréulein, I should warn you,
guns make me very nervous.
They're to keep away the spies
from the chemical companies.
Many times already
they have tried to steal our discoveries.
Yes, we live in a world
of avarice and deceit.
- Here, at least, there's no avarice.
- Really?
The Bleuchamp Institute
is not for profit, Sir Hilary.
The Count does his work
for the sake of mankind.
He wants to leave his mark
on the entire world.
- Characteristic ambition.
- Characteristic?
- Of a true humanitarian.
- Ah!
Formerly it was a sports club,
open to the public.
Now it belongs to the Count,
who has given it to scientific research.
Josef, Sir Hilary Bray
will take number four.
I will show you there after Grunther
has taken you for a medical examination.
- I'm quite all right now.
- You are our honoured guest, Sir Hilary.
And after your experience
in the helicopter,
we must make sure
that you are well again.
- Grunther, take Sir Hilary to Dr von Sant.
- Ja, Fréulein.
- Yes?
- Der Englénder ist gekommen.
- Provide him with the usual comforts.
- Ja.
- And then take them to number four.
- Ja.
If you wish anything for your comfort,
you must ring this.
- And the attendant will come.
- Very considerate. Thank you.
You must also ring for him
to open the door
-when you wish to leave.
- A complicated arrangement.
and disturbing each other
when they should be resting.
The Count believes very strongly
in undisturbed rest.
Prudent fellow. When can I see him?
We have a lot to discuss.
He will send for you, Sir Hilary,
when he's ready.
Meanwhile, I should like you to join me
in the Alpine room before dinner.
- Alpine room?
- Yes.
Grunther will come for you.
Shall we say seven?
Ah, Sir Hilary!
Please, come to meet our patients.
- How do you do?
- He's a famous genealogist.
- You will have a drink, yes?
- Please, come and sit down.
- What is a baronet?
- It's a kind of inferior baron.
- Oh, how disappointing.
- Well, er...
Oh, I don't mean you're inferior,
I mean the title is.
Yes, but what's a gynae... genealogist?
What is that?
- Pommy word for an old people's doctor.
- Ah! So he's here to cure Fréulein Bunt.
- What will you drink, sir?
- Malt whisky and branch water, please.
I'm sorry I was so rude
about what a baronet is.
- Sir.
- Thank you.
- Er, you mean there aren't any others?
- Only the staff, and you can't count them.
But what is a genealogist?
Will nobody tell me?
- It would be a pleasure to tell you.
- Well?
Genealogy is all about
ancestors and families.
I mean, it could easily be
that any one of you here
If only we could go back
far enough to find out.
We do not use surnames here.
It is a rule of the clinic.
Our schedule is rather strict.
So is our diet.
Sir Hilary, if you would sit there,
between Helen and Ruby.
I'm afraid I've never had
much to do with young ladies.
- I hope you enjoy it.
- Thank you. I'm sure I will.
- Are you here for Christmas, Sir Hilary?
- Er, well, I might be.
- Oh, good! Then we can have a party.
- That sort of thing's not quite in my line.
I used to hate chicken.
Used to make me break out.
It was all over.
You'd be surprised where.
- Potatoes did it to me. Now I adore them.
- No medical histories, please.
Girls, I'm sure Sir Hilary would like to tell
us about the College of Arms in London.
- If you'd really enjoy that.
Please. Yes!
- Fascinating!
- Tell us all about it.
The Herald's College,
or College of Arms,
consists of 13 members
of the royal household,
appointed by the sovereign
to run armorial, genealogical,
-ceremonial and other matters.
Mm-hm.
The 13 members
are divided into three categories:
Their titles and offices
are of great antiquity.
...when I tell you the first Clarenceux,
King-of-Arms, was created in 1334
Now, when we authorise a coat of arms,
it can include all sorts of funny things.
Crescent moons, portcullises,
beasts couchant and rampant,
I brought a book on the subject. There's
a picture of my own coat of arms,
No, no! He will give the book to me.
I will pass it to everyone in turn.
- It is fairer like that, yes?
- Of course. If you think so, Fréulein.
Just a slight stiffness coming on
in the shoulder.
What a nice man!
Sweet!
- Good evening, Sir Hilary.
- Good evening.
If you'll forgive me,
that's what I'm here to find out.
To confirm, Sir Hilary.
There can be no doubt of the truth.
If there were no doubt,
the college would not have sent me.
Well, since you are here,
I'll make everything very plain to you.
To begin with,
I was born without ear lobes.
A well-known congenital
distinction of Bleuchamp ancestry.
Like the Hapsburg lip,
or the hawknose of the Medicis.
Granted, but the fact
you're of de Bleuchamp ancestry
The college will require
more concrete proofs.
I have all the relevant documents:
title deeds, certificates of birth and death.
They'll be sent to your room
for authentication.
And you've only to ask Fréulein Bunt
for anything at all you may require.
- Are you comfortable here?
- Yes, but puzzled by your clinic.
Well, the methods of the great pioneers
have often puzzled conventional minds.
I have devised a cure for allergies
which depends on holding
an unusual and rather delicate
psychological balance.
So, you see, I must impose
special conditions on my patients.
The cure is not entirely
psychological, Sir Hilary.
Vaccines which must be modified
to suit each individual case.
I might not be able to spare you
as much time as I might wish.
If you wish to be confirmed as the Count,
you must give me some of your time.
I need details of living relatives,
your parents and grandparents.
- The documents you will see...
- Can answer many questions, but not all.
- Could you accompany me to Augsburg?
- Augsburg?
The ancestral home
of the de Bleuchamp family.
There are notable Bleuchamp tombs, and
important records in the city archives.
That may not be convenient
for some time.
But I'm determined
my title shall be recognised.
- Proceed with your preliminary research.
- I'll be happy to start straightaway.
...al/e eingeschlossen
sind. Der Gast darf nicht gestért werden.
Du hast zwar nichts gefunden,
aber bleib wachsam.
- Sir Hilary!
- Shh...
I've brought you the book.
- The illustrated book?
- No, don't turn it on.
- I want to see the pictures.
- But you're a picture yourself.
You are funny
at pretending not to like girls.
That lipstick was an inspiration.
So are you.
- What's your name?
- Ruby Bartlett, from Lancashire.
- Morecambe Bay actually.
- How did you get here?
It's true!
My family's got a chicken farm and every
time I did something on it, I nearly died.
The specialist said there was a wonderful
Swiss clinic where they cured you free
- No, about the clinic, I mean.
- Oh!
Well, the specialist had me
meet Fréulein Bunt in London
and she said I had
a very interesting case.
- Oh, bother!
Do you remember
when you first came here,
How you were sick
when you even saw one?
But all that is over now,
for! have shown you how foolish it was
- And soon you will go home
- Ruby!
- To look after the chickens,
- Ruby, wake up!
You do love me just a little,
don't you, Hilly?
I must teach you
how to give them special care
- Ruby, wake up!
-/ will tell you when.
I come to see the book.
The pictures, yes?
Oh, jolly good idea.
Now, where did I put it?
- Perhaps if we turn on the light.
- No!
- But, Sir Hilary...
- Hilly.
Coming here like this
was an inspiration, and so are you.
- You'll need to be.
- What you say?
I said a miracle our meeting like this.
I don't even know your name.
Surely there's a restaurant, a sports club
up there. I've seen them advertised.
- It's all closed down.
- Since when? I've seen them advertised.
You are mistaken, sir.
For many weeks now they are finished.
From here upwards now is forbidden!
Private! Closed!
Hey!
- Sir Hilary!
- Good morning.
Good morning, Sir Hilary.
Your stiffness of last night, it is all gone?
- For the time being.
- Then come and do curling with us.
- Won't it be frightfully energetic?
- No.
We will show you.
- You can teach me.
- We're leaving very soon. I must see you.
- Eight o'clock tonight.
- Ah! Good morning, ladies.
Morning!
Good morning, Sir Hilary,
and how's your research?
I've never heard
anything so ridiculous.
Since when is climbing
a criminal of fence?
- Excuse me. Piz Gloria's private property.
- The whole bloody Alp?! Ridiculous!
There are many signs,
and my servant warned you at the station.
No, Fraulein! I had my throw.
Made a mess of it, I'm afraid.
- Yes! Go on!
- Very civil of you.
- Who the hell are you, anyway?
- I am the director of this institute.
You'll be sent down by cable car
and you will not trouble us again.
- They'll be sent down later.
- But they're mine!
We have certain rules
which must be observed.
- The authorities'll hear about this.
- Good day, sir.
- Director, or Count, as I think I can say.
- Yes?
I'd like the afternoon off,
so if the cable car's going down...
I must have some fresh air.
Your ancestors are very hard work.
And the College of Arms
is being very well paid.
- Well, if you put it like that...
- I do put it like that.
Let me show you what I've achieved,
then we can go to Augsburg.
Not over Christmas.
The archives will be closed, no?
Girls, that is
enough curling for today.
- I must see you tonight.
- Nine o'clock?
- Hilly's so sad that Ruby's leaving.
- I'm Sir Hilary Bray.
- Oh, no, no, no, Mr Bond.
Respectable baronets from colleges
do not seduce female patients in clinics.
On the other hand, they do get
their professional details right.
The Bleuchamp tombs
are not in the Augsburg Cathedral,
Takes more than a few props
to turn 007 into a herald.
It'll take more than cutting off
your ear lobes to turn you into a count.
I may yet surprise you, but I'm afraid
that you have no surprises left for me.
such a keen climber, such a brilliant
conversationalist. Before he left us.
- He reported where I am.
- I doubt that.
In any case,
no one's coming to your rescue.
In a few hours, the United Nations
will receive our yuletide greetings.
The information that I now possess
the scientific means to control,
or to destroy, the economy
of the whole world.
People will have more important things
to think of than you.
- If they believe your threat.
Oh, they will. In any case,
I have prepared a demonstration.
Remember that disagreeable outbreak
of foot-and-mouth disease
I shall instruct them, in very convincing
terms, exactly how I arranged that.
- Bacteriological warfare.
- With a difference.
Our great breakthrough
since last summer
has been the confection
of a certain virus omega.
- Infertility.
- Total infertility. In plants and animals.
Not just disease in a few herds, Mr Bond
or the loss of a single crop.
But the destruction of a whole strain
for ever, throughout an entire continent.
If my demands are not met,
I'll proceed with the extinction
of whole species of cereals
and livestock all over the world.
Not after their scientists analyse a sample
of virus omega they have received.
Nothing is born.
No seed even begins to sprout.
- They'll find an antidote.
- Of course!
They'll have time. Once they're warned,
you'll have problems dispensing the stuff.
I have been training
my own special "angels of death".
- Those girls?
- Those girls. And many others like them.
And how many millions do you
want for your services this time?
This time the price is different. You'll be
more amused when you know what.
Meanwhile, I will
keep you here as my guest.
You'll be useful in helping
to convince the authorities
Come, let me show you
to your new quarters.
You're likely to be with us
for some time, Mr Bond.
a little therapy
to soothe your restless nature.
You perverse British,
how you love your exercise.
Every year, dozens of amateur climbers,
they wind up in the same predicament.
A kind of waxwork show
for morbid tourists.
Dear, dear me.
Now, now, now, now, Mr Bond,
you must learn to be absolutely calm
before we can accept you back
into polite society.
Going-away presents.
From the Count himself,
- I want to open mine now!
- Oh, no!
It is more fun
to open them all together, yes?
Please sit down.
We will wait for the others.
Look, pressies!
- Your very good health, my dears.
Cheers.
It has something special in it
for the holy night celebration.
...and now you're going
on a journey. A journey home.
I will tell you when.
And I will tell you how.
They're beautiful and
you're longing to know what is inside.
Every night
at exactly 12 o'clock you must be alone
I'll tell you what to do
I will tell you when
After you've heard what I say, push the
mirror back to conceal the receiver again.

Merry Christmas!
Maybe you should have been

Goodbye, girls.
Merry Christmas and a happy New Year.

- Auf wiedersehen!
Auf wiedersehen!
- Der Englénder ist ins Don' gef/iichtet.
- Er ist ausgeriickt?
Der Englénder. Quick!
Wir mtissen ihn umzingeln.
- Come on.
They need sunshine and raindrops
Reindeer, even though they try,
they need other things
- Darling, you're in trouble. What is it?
- There's people after me.
- Can I help?
- Have you got a car?
- Outside.
- I wouldn't go banco on that.
- Giving up bad habits, eh?
- James, where are we heading?
- Nearest post office to contact London.
- Why are they looking for you?
- I suspect they're trying to kill me.
- No sign of them yet.
- Or of someone saying thank you.
ear lobes. What were you doing
so near Piz Gloria?
- Winter sports? Very wholesome.
- Just one winter sportsman.
- Turn left. A crowd may discourage them.
- Stehen bleibenl
-{honks horn}
-{screaming}
- We can get out there.
- If you say so.
{Bond} I said a crowd
would discourage them.
Sorry about the accommodation,
Contessa.
- You'll get another chance.
- But when?
Let's get some rest.
We'll push on as soon as we can.
Mm-mm. Her Majesty's Secret Service
is still my job.
But there's nothing you can do
about your job at the moment, is there?
Tracy, an agent shouldn't be concerned
with anything but himself.
- We'll just have to go on the way we are.
- No.
I wonder how much
they're asking for this place.
The proper time for this
is our wedding night.
- Whatever you say, darling.
- And that is yours.
- Oh!
- It's not New Year yet!
- James!
- Keep going!
- Simple!
- Good girl!
- James!
- Keep going!
A grave deep enough, I think,
to prevent even 007 from walking.
{Moneypenny} United Nations, sir.
Red scrambler.
Of course, there's a total news blackout,
but my informant was very plain.
- How plain, sir?
- They're going to buy Blofeld off.
- And the price?
- Amnesty.
Official recognition of his title
when he retires into private life
Blofeld wants a decision
by midnight the day after tomorrow.
Sir, that gives us time
to get to Piz Gloria first -in force.
Sir, destroy the institute
and Blofeld's virus with it.
Sir, if we destroy the centre of
communication that controls the girls,
I have my orders, 007.
You have yours. Forget it.
And the girl who helped me
We just leave her?
This department is not concerned
with your personal problems.
- She saved my life.
- Operation Bedlam is dead.
- Do you understand?
- Yes, sir.
Your call to Marc Ange Draco,
Head of Draco Construction.
- Hello, Draco.
- Who is it?
- Bond. James Bond.
- Thank God, James.
I'd like to interest you in a deal requiring
certain aerial activity to install equipment.
Are you sure we're going to find Teresa
when we get up there?
I'm pretty certain.
There's a good reason for going anyway.
- If they agree.
- They can do nothing else. You know it.
I shall be able to offer you
anything your heart could wish for.
Oh, come now, Tracy,
don't be so proud.
Your own father's profession
is not entirely within the law.
His brotherhood also have exotic ways
to keep it a close shot.
{woman} Basie Approach calling
unidentified aircraft over Basie-
I think some people
don't know we are crusaders.
Whereas if you displease me,
I can promise you a very different estate.
- Excuse me, sir.
- Yes?
There is something on the radio
you should hear.
- Excuse me.
- This is Ziirich Information
I repeat. This is Ziirich Information
calling unidentified aircraft...
That helicopter is one of three.
None have answered air control.
- And?
- There are suspect aircraft in the vicinity.
Ziirich, this is Foxtrot Golf Sierra,
leading Red Cross helicopter flight.
Carrying Red Cross medical supplies
to Italy. What's the trouble? Over.
We have no record of your ﬂight plan
or registration, over.
I repeat, we have no record
of your flight plan or registration, over.
Then your registrations
must be out of date, over.
Foxtrot Golf Sierra, this is Zurich
Information. Land at Ziirich and report.
I say again,
land at Ziirich and report, over.
Do you wish to commit murder?
I told you, this is a mercy flight
carrying blood plasma
and emergency equipment
for the victims
of the Italian flood disaster at Rovigo.
- Golf Sierra?
- Yes?
In case one of us is delayed on the way
home, it's better to have a rendezvous.
Before we start getting sentimental,
I think we're being followed.
This is military air control.
There is no record of your mission.
Fighters have been dispatched
to intercept you.
Check with Geneva.
Check with the Red Cross in Geneva.
Foxtrot Golf Sierra,
you are carrying passengers?
Distinguished representatives
of the world press.
They've had enough
of your nonsense. So have I.
- Take me to the Alpine room.
- Oh?
What were all the world's charms
to mighty Paris
when he found that first dawn
in the arms of his Helen?
And when do you expect the signal
accepting your terms?
"Thy dawn, O Master of the World,
thy dawn.
"For thee the sunlight
creeps across the lawn.
"For thee the ships
are drawn down to the waves.
"For thee the markets throng
with myriad slaves.
- Helicopters!
- Get our positions covered!
- Tracy! Darling!
- Thank God, Teresa.
- Guns make me nervous.
- You've done your share.
- All points covered?
- Yes, sir.
- All set to blow?
- Fuse is set for exactly
five minutes, ten seconds.
The place will be sealed off for ever.
Will that give the Englishman
time to get out?
- Where are you going?
- Where's James?
- We can't leave him!
- He doesn't need you.
- I will not go without him!
- You'll have to.
Never mind that!
Go and get the brandy, huh?
-{bells ringing}
-{man} Your Royal Highnesses,
- Good luck, Teresa.
- Thank you.
to meet the man who cost me
three of my best operators.
You even got away with
quite a chunk of the haul.
Congratulations, 007. I must confess
I've sometimes thought you a little, erm...
- Irresponsible?
- Exactly! That's the word. Thank you!
- This time, my boy, I can't complain.
- Nor can I.
- Teresa.
- Yes, Papa?
Look, James, I know that
we haven't always exactly seen...
Well, don't forget,
if there's anything you need...
Thank you, but this time I have
the gadgets and I know how to use them.
Remember, obey your husband
in all things. You promise me?
"Her price is far above rubies",
or even your million pounds.
Teresa, just because you're Mrs Bond,
don't forget my birthday next year.
- Have I ever?
- Both of you, or maybe all of you!
- Au revoir.
- G ood bye!
Miss Moneypenny,
what would you do without me?
O07 never had any respect
for government property.
- Pleased?
- Mm, not bad for a start.
But, darling,
now we have all the time in the world.
-{cheering}
-{Tracy laughs}
He's got a point, we do
look like an ad for a flower shop!
And that reminds me,
I didn't even send you ﬂowers.
Anyway, you have given me
a wedding present.
- He loves me.
-Instinctively.
- Infuriatingly.
-Intensely.
- In...
- In? In?
- In.
-Indubitably.
It's quite all right, really.
She's having a rest.
There's no hurry, you see?
We have all the time in the world.
