Control, 2707. No messages.
AII right, ten-four. I have a request

Patch me through to 555 3312, pIease.
Calling your girlfriend to say you'll be late

Thanks for nothing, ControI.
Ah, this is great
Agh! Goddamn it.
Lovers' Iane.
Hi! PoIice.
This is an emergency.
I have to use your phone.

I'm not here, OK? I'II be a second.
$100 bottIe of champagne!
she's worth it.
Aw, damn, the machine's on, you know?
You have one? I hate them.
You got a KIeenex? Ah, forget it.
That's aII right. This'II come off.
- Ah. Hi, Tracy. Yeah, it's DooIey.
-
I'm just caIIing to Iet you know
I'm gonna be a IittIe Iate.
What's that?
I gotta go, honey.
WeII, it's not the Eyewitness News team.
I think someone's mad at me.
DefiniteIy, someone is mad at me.
- Whoo!
- Hey, DooIey!
Got a ride home tonight?
- Byers, I need a car.
- Can I ask you something?
- Later. PIease, I need a car. Mine bIew up.
- Just one question. One question.
How many cops use their day off
tryin' to get their asses shot off?
- I was set up!
- How many?
Look, I got him, OK?
I'm this cIose, Rog. I got Lyman.
- Give me a number. I'II write it down.
- 50 miIIion.
Lyman's moving 50 miIIion.
This is the big one, Rog, and I got him.
Mike, you don't have dick on Lyman.
What you've got
is a wet suit,
a bad attitude and a bIown-up car.
Right. That's what I toId you. I need a car.
You want a car, take a partner.
It's a two-for-one deaI.
- No, I'm not takin' a partner.
- Take Davis.
- Davis hates me.
- OK, uh... spencer. How about spencer?
- I hate spencer.
- You know the roster. Pick somebody.
- Lydecker. He's a good man.
- Lydecker's dead.
That's why I Iike him.
Doesn't sIow me down.
Rog. 50 miIIion. 50 miIIion and Lyman.
know that there's a shipment comin' in?
High-tuned cop sense.
You remember that, Rog.
That's what you used to have, remember?
Before you became
a paper-pushin' pansy.
Paper-pushin' pansy. I Iike it.
Can you say it five times reaI quick?
- Paper-pushin' pansy...
- You're pathetic.
You're jeaIous because
I made Iieutenant first.
You're right. You're right.
I'm green with envy because
I'd Iove to spend my days here with my
Iips Iocked to the commissioner's butt!
- screw you, DooIey!
- Right now, Roger. Come on!
- Don't push me!
- Take your best shot!
You did. You hit me.
I don't beIieve you hit me.
- Do I get the car?
- You'II take a partner?
- No.
- No car.
OK. Fine.
I don't need your heIp.
I'II take Lyman aIone.
Honey?
sweetheart!
shit.
Trace.
Trace, I know you're mad.
You have every right to be.
I know tonight
was supposed to be speciaI.
I mean, the wine, the garIic chicken,
which is my favourite,
scaIIoped potatoes, the peas...
The peas. Even though I hate peas.
They're good for me
and that shows me that you care, honey.
I know I'm three hours Iate.
I am. And, uh...
- WeII, what can I say?
- Hi.
- Hi.
-  Hi.
- Hi.
- This is Chad, Mike.
- Chad?
- Yes, Chad.
- A friend from work. Works for Pan Am.
- Uh-huh.
One of those, uh,
baggage-handIer kinda guys?
No, more Iike
one of those piIot kinda guys.
Honey, you're a book editor.
How did you meet smiIin' Jack here?
WeII, he, um...
has aIso written three best seIIers.
- Books? ManuaIs? Instructions?
- Look, I've got an earIy fIight tomorrow.
- Maybe I...
- Thanks for the movie, Chad.
Any time. We'II have dinner when I get
back from Hong Kong. The three of us.
- Wow. What a night that'II be.
- Good night.
-  Good night.
-  Good night, Chad.
- You're dating? That was a date?
- He's a friend. We went to the movies.
- Do me a favour.
- Mike.
Do me a favour. When you go to the
movies, go to the movies with ugIy guys.
UgIy guys with shitty jobs.
- You have a shitty job.
- That's right. see what I mean?
so we're perfect for each other.
Why didn't you wait for me?
Because if I Iived my Iife
around your scheduIe, I'd go nuts.
I'd be a cIock-tower sniper in a month.
It's hard enough,
knowing that making a bust
is more important to you
than making time for me.
Now, I Iove you, Mike, but I can't
count on you, so I do what I have to do.
Eat your peas. They're good for you.
- You know, I'm onto something big.
- You aIways are.
It's Lyman. I think I got him scared.
- He tried to kiII me tonight.
- Just what I wanted to hear.
- I feeI so much better now
- Look, Iook.
What do you want me to say, honey?
I'II say it.
It's not what you say.
I know what's important to you.
It's not me. It's the next bust or the next
shipment or south American cheesebaII.
Now, I know that. And I either have to deaI
with that or find some other way to Iive.
AII right. Look.
If you hate it so much, just move out.
Just take your shoes and move out.
I own this house. You moved in with me.
That's right. That's right.
I was wondering how I couId afford
such a nice pIace. It's reaIIy... so tastefuI.
- It's very nice. You did a very nice job.
- Mike...
Forget it for now. I know
verbaI skiIIs aren't your strong point.
- What are my strong points?
- No, not those either.
- You're a Iiar.
- You're a bragger.
-
-
HeIIo. DooIey.
Got an address on Freddie, huh?
No, give it to me.
Uh-huh.
No, no. No bIack-and-whites.
I don't wanna scare him.
Uh-huh.
No, no.
-
- Oh, damn it. I missed it.
God, I'm oId.
- Ernie. " Que pasa?
- Bitch of a night.

How about a tip?
CoId damn pizza.
Gotta get a microwave in here.
You just ran a stop sign!
Good morning.

surprised to see me?
You set me up, Freddie.

- Then what are you running from?
I need the exercise.
Exercise? I can heIp you there, Freddie.
You know, this whoIe jogging thing,
I just don't get it.
- DooIey, what the heII are you doing?
- But if you don't run,
you miss the precious aerobic benefits.
Make a right hand signaI for me,

Jesus, DooIey, what are you doin'?
Oh, you got those sIim ItaIian shoes, huh?
I think we quaIify for a carpooI.
DooIey, you're gonna kiII me!
What are you doin'?
AII right! You busted

Now I wanna know,

Huh? Come on,

In fact, he's a IittIe stressed out.

This ain't a good pIace to be a cop.
If I caught you at a bad time,

Yeah, you know, DooIey,

That'd be too easy on you
and it wouIdn't be any fun for me.

He's Iookin' to score Iarge. That's it.

That's aII right. That was worth it.
so, you wanna teII me why I was taIking
to a dead man this afternoon?
We had no way of knowing
that guy wasn't in the car.
Yeah. That's because
you were in a heIicopter.
What kind of buIIshit is that?
Choppers, machine guns.
Who do you guys think you are? Marines?
And you.
Why didn't you come to me?
Haven't I aIways taken care of you?
And you pay me back
by sending the Iaw to my warehouse.
I didn't teII him nothin'!
I don't know how he found out about that.
Come on. I'd never roII on you guys.
I'm worried.
This guy DooIey's crazy.
Yeah. Crazy.
WeII, I'II teII you something, Freddie.
You wouIdn't be in this position
if these pissants had done their job.
You wanna know how to kiII a man?
WeII, I'II teII you how to kiII a man.
You forget this hi-tech stuff.
You get a gun.
And then you find the man,
and you grab him.
And you put the gun to his head,
and you send his brains into outer space.
Not bad, huh?
Yeah. It's my nephew's.
It's a toy.
This one's reaI.
Now, this DooIey's
aIready into me for one shipment.
I don't want him to get
the next one. You understand?
- He's dead.
- ''He's dead, he's dead.''
Don't teII me he's dead!
I want it done right this time.
I want it finished with this...
cop.
CIean this up.
Trace?
Honey?
Tracy?
I'm Iate. I'm Iate. I know I'm Iate.
I know I'm Iate. We missed
the baIIet tonight, didn't we? Damn!
And you know how
I Iove the baIIet. Love it!
I... Oh, you got the fIowers.
I... I didn't know that.
Yeah, you owe me $45. They came COD.
Did you know you have an animaI
growing out of your pants?
Thank you, honey. I aIso have a dog here.
- Why is it among us?
- Oh, that's the reason I'm Iate.
I was racing home, trying
to get here to pick you up for the baIIet,
and I passed this window,
and there he was.
Just sitting there,
Iooking a IittIe IoneIy, a IittIe heIpIess.
I had to pick him up, honey. You Iike him?
- He's very sweet.
- He is, isn't he?
- Does he have a name?
- Uh-uh.
I think we shouId think of one together.
- How about...
- Jerry! Jerry's a good name.
- Yeah. Jerry. That's great.
- Does he do any tricks?
No, I haven't had
too much time to work with him.
Can you speak?
Good boy! Can you kiss?
Ooh!
Oh, you're a good puppy dog, huh?
- You're a sweetheart!
- Ass-kisser.
Oh, sure, I taught him those tricks.
Those are nothin', the easy ones.
I've been workin' on tougher things.
You know, Iike card tricks.
Tracy, I'm reaIIy sorry about the baIIet.
I promise I'II take you Iater in the season,
Iike, during the pIay-offs.
- He's very protective.
- Mm-hm.
Agh!
Come here! Come on in the kitchen!
Come on in the kitchen!
Come on in the kitchen.
- Come on, Jerry. Come on.
- OK. Go with DooIey.
Yeah! Yeah!
Let's get somethin' to eat! Yeah!
Ooh, yeah!
Look. Let's get one thing straight:
the woman is mine!
We're both members of the animaI
kingdom. You know that, I know that.
And we both know
that this thing is reaIIy primaI.
If you think you're such a badass,
try that once more
and you're gonna end up
in a pet cemetery.
You remember the movie
Old Yeller?. Do you?
Remember when
they shot him at the end?
I didn't cry! Now come on!
Honey, I think he needs to go outside.
Nice night. Enjoy the view.
-  Do you think he's in pain?
-  Not yet.
Honey, why... why wouId he be in pain?
shut that damn dog up!
some of us are tryin' to sIeep!
I'II handIe it.
Come on, Jerry. You hungry?
A IittIe Iate-night snack?
You know, we're a coupIe
of smart guys, you know that?
I Iike that in a dog. She Iikes that in a dog.
And she Iikes you.
But she Ioves me!
I just need a coupIe of hours.
You understand?
Here. You hungry?
T-bone. 16-ounce.
Mm. Good.
It'II thaw out in a few hours. Have a baII.
I'm back. AII right.
Mm.
- Give me that.
- DooIey!
-  Mm.
-  He sucked that thing frozen!
-  What?
-  Nothin'. Nothin'.
You're trying to piss me off, aren't you?
You're pissing me off!
- Come on! Come on!
-
Come on! Behind you!
Come on! Come here. Ow! Ow!
- My eye! My eye!
- DooIey!
- Hi, honey.
- What's going on?
I think he was just a IittIe bit IoneIy.
He wanted to pIay.
- We shouId bring him into the bedroom.
- No!
- I don't think so.
- Come on. What a good boy!
- Oh, he Ioves it out here! He reaIIy does!
- Come on.
You're a sweetheart.
Just a IittIe sweetheart.
Come on, DooIey.
-  Oh!
-
Mm. Ouch. Ooh.
-
-  Ow, you bit me. Ow.
- stop that. You can't bite me.
- You Iove it.
I can't. I can't do it.
- Why?
- He's watchin' me. I can feeI his eyes.
Look at him.
He's sitting there evaIuating me.
He's not the one you have to impress.
Jesus!
- Want some eggs?
- No, I'II catch a doughnut downtown.
I gotta get goin'. Bye.
- Thank you for a heII of a night.
- My pIeasure. I mean that!
- Oh... I mean it too. Good morning!
-
What's the matter? Can't take it? Huh?
Kinda grinds you down in the battIe
of wits, you're fighting unarmed?
WeII, you're just a bad Ioser, that's aII.
You gotta Iearn one thing: winning
isn't everything, but Iosing is nothing.
- DooIey...
- Huh? Yeah?
Yes, ma'am.
- Aw, shit.
- ExactIy.
I can't beIieve
aII that came out of one animaI.
Hey, notice anything different?
Huh? sure you do.
I used to say ''Get in the car'', ''Get outta
the car'', ''Get in the back seat'', ''stay''.
Commands are out. This is in.
There you go. You don't wanna Iisten,
I don't wanna taIk.
AII right? see you Iater, bub.
- Your champagne, sir.
- What is this?
- I didn't order any champagne.
- I know that, sir. It's a gift.
Take it back.
It must beIong to somebody eIse.
- They said Mr GiIIiam.
- I said get it out of here.
I don't want the champagne.
Lunch today?
- Is it expensive?
- Yes.
- How about a taII iced tea?
- There's a minimum.
- Why don't you just bring me the...
- OK.
..menu?
Good boy!
What a good dog you are.
sit!
speak!
sit up.
Go put your baII away.
Gimme some Iovin'!
That's... that's... that's great.
That's reaIIy... How do you do that?
WeII, first of aII, you've got
to give the dog a Iot of Iove.
- A good, heaIthy diet.
- ChiIIi.
Exercise is important, too.
You know, the key
is to estabIish aIpha Ieader
as soon as possibIe.
- AIpha Ieader? What's that?
- You gotta show 'em who's boss.
- Imprint on their psyche.
- I've done that. BeIieve me, I've done that.
- What... what... what is it, exactIy.
- Most effective is to stare them down.
You Iook straight at them.
You make them Iook away first.
- I can do that.
- Even if it takes hours.
I can do that. I can do that.
- That's it, right?
- After that, you mount them.
- Excuse me?
- You mount them.
- You mount them?
- Uh-huh.
- You mean...?
- Yeah.
Mount them?
Mount them. Lucky dog.
Mount them?
Jesus!
- What are you doin' here?
- sir? Excuse me.
- No dogs in the hoteI.
- What about her?
- What about her?
- she has a dog. What do you caII that?
The hoteI owner's daughter.
And the dog has to go.
- WeII, this is my seeing Eye dog.
- You're bIind?
- Yes.
- Were you bIind when you waIked in?
Yes, definiteIy.
I'm so sorry. WouId you Iike me
to read you the menu?
No, I can handIe it.
Thank you.
Is that my tea?
You just ripped the mirror off
of my cIassic 1965 Mustang.
I don't beIieve it. I just don't beIieve it.
If you don't get down -
I don't care where we are -
I'm gonna puII my revoIver out
and shoot you.
I am the aIpha Ieader.
I don't wanna have to mount you.
That'II do it.
Jerry Lee! Excuse me. I'm bIind.
I'm bIind. I'm bIind. I'm bIind.
Excuse me. I'm bIind! I'm bIind.
shit!
I don't know why you CaIifornia peopIe
insist on meeting outside.
If I wanted a tan,
I wouIda gone to the Bahamas.
I Iike CaIifornia. It's been good to me.
- Tonight is the night.
- sounds good, but so did the Iast time.
- Ten miIIion bucks' worth of coke, gone.
- Never again. Nobody'II get this.
- If there's exposure...
- I don't Iike a nervous partner,
so caIm down or I'm gonna bIow this
whoIe deaI and seII to somebody eIse.
Oh...!
Don't threaten me, Mr Lyman.
I'm in the threat business.
- PIease don't take this the wrong way.
-
-  We need to get detaiIs straight.
- Just make sure you hoId up your end.
- You just make sure everything's on time.
- I'm not gonna wait for ever.
I'm reaIIy sorry. You don't know what's
goin' on here, but you just saved my Iife.
Agh!
I appreciate that.
Ughhh. Very kind of you. Thank you.
Come here!
What do you want? Get back.
Get back! Get away from me.
What are you taIkin' about?
Get away from me.
What? There's nothin' in here for you.
This is poIice stuff here.
Go away. Get away from me.
This is mine!
Let me eat in peace, wiII you?
What? What? You can't have this!
AII right. I'II spIit it.
I'II spIit it with you, OK?
What? I said I'd spIit it with you!
Here! Here! Here! Here!
Take the whoIe goddamn thing!
Jesus! There's aII kinds of sugar in that.
Down!
Jesus!
You Iook Iike
you've been in a skiing accident!
You wanna drive, get a Iicence!
Yeah!
What?
What?
Wait! I've onIy got two Iegs!
- Agh!
-
AII right. I'm comin'. I'm comin'!
Don't Iet that dog psych you out.
I'm comin'! shut your yap!
I'm comin'. I just want a running start
before I hit the pavement.
Aaarghhh!
Christ! Jesus! I wouIda cIeared it
if you hadn't barked.
You threw me off!
I suppose you think you're
such a hotshot... because you made it.
You sure about this, huh?
Oh, yeah, he's up here!
Yes, sir! Got a smart puppy there!
-
- What?!
Whaddaya want? There's no one up here!
There's nobody here. What?
I jumped over that damn thing
and no one's up here.
Hey! Get back here when
I'm yeIIin' at you! I want you to Iisten.
What are you barkin' at?
Oh no, I got it. You're not barkin'.
No, no. I can teII the difference
between a bark and a Iaugh!
This is a dog joke. Ha, ha, ha, ha
Oh, I'm Iaughin'. How many guys
have you brought up here, huh?
No, you puIIed a good one.
I can see you down tonight, taIking
to your chums, down at the pound.
Yeah, havin' a good one.
''I puIIed one on oId DooIey.''
You never give up, do you?
Arghhh!
Now there's a guy who definiteIy
has a right to remain siIent.
-
- What?
What do you want now? Want a medaI?
Huh?
AII right, aII right. You found him.
Good job.
Here you go. HaIstead Motors.
Got it.

- Detective DooIey.
- And he is...?
- With me.

It says you've arrived, Mike. It speaks
of stabiIity, cIass, famiIy vaIues.
- But I'm singIe, Don.
- It's a babemobiIe, Mike.
- I gotta have it. Let's test-drive it.
- Can do, Mike. I'II get the keys.
AII right, buddy. Let's get this thing
outta here, then you can have it.
- Detective DooIey?
- Yes.

- Oh, Jack, yeah.
I was gonna take this baby

- Do you have 70,000 doIIars?
- No, but I can do better than that.
I have a brand-new Mercedes,
Iow miIeage.
It was used once,
in an attempted murder.
Oh yes. This one.
This car was reported stoIen off the Iot
at four o'cIock this morning.
Aw, Jack, does that mean
we don't have a deaI?
CaII your station and confirm it,
but not from my phone
and not from my Iot.
AII right. I know, I know. I know the car's

I wanna be there at the exchange.

You know what? This kind Ioves cops.
Loves 'em.
Boy, can you imagine
what she'd do to you?
WeII, that's too bad. You're on duty now.
It's definiteIy an aII-nighter.
You got ten minutes.
- What are you doing?
- Don't Iean against my ride.
This is your car? I'm sorry.
Don't stand next to it.
stand next to yours.
That's nice, but this is beautifuI.
Where'd you get those gIasses?
Did you get those gIasses in the maII?
I'd Iike to get a pair of those.
I need some sungIasses. Is this your car?
- something's goin' on in there.
- In here?

No!

Let's work something out.
They're aImost done.

For my Aretha? Get reaI!
That's a $100 dog!
How about 25 bucks

Trace?
Honey. Honey?
What are you actin' up about?
You shouId be meIIow. You got Iaid.
Uh, oops.
l think l have the wrong number.
- Yes, you do.
-  Yeah, Tracy, it's Jack.
We've changed the date of the seminar
to the 5th,
so you have more time to prepare
your material. OK? See ya.
l'm calling for
Michael Dooley. This is the third call.
This is Stan Gamboa
from lnternal Revenue...
- Yeah, right, stan.
- ..set up a time for your audit. Call me.
Yeah, I'II caII ya. sure. Fat chance.
Dooley, listen carefully.
l'm with some people right now.
They came to the house.
Dooley, you have to do
what they say. Please.
Dooley?
Tracy's real smart.
She's behaving.
You gotta be smart too
if you wanna see her again.
That shipment you're chasin', just
let it go. Stay home tonight. Don't leave.
Do your part and you'll have breakfast
with your girl tomorrow.
And don't push this any more.
Wash it, wax it, put a windshieId in.
Hi!
- Hey.
- It's by invitation onIy.
- CaII the cops.
- You don't beIong here.
CaII the cops.
sorry we're Iate!
Ken!
This is a bitchin' pad, man!
You got a pooI in your dining room!
You know, I gotta get one of these.
Hey, I'm sorry Tracy couIdn't make it,
but she kinda disappeared on me.
But the invitation did say bring a guest,
so I brought Jerry Lee.
- Why don't you mingIe with the guests?
- I'm gonna have to ask you to Ieave.
Ken, come on now. I just got here.
- PIease escort this man to the door.
- Freeze!
Oh, I'm not gonna shoot you.
You guys are good guys.
He's the bad guy.
Ken, I'd have a seat.
You don't Iook too good.
WeII, I think we'd best aII do as he says.
No, Ken, just you. Not ''we'' - ''you''.
This poor man is obviousIy
confused and upset.
Upset? Do I Iook upset to you?
Am I upset? Do I Iook upset?
I'm not upset.
I'm a party animaI! I Iove parties, Ken!
Come on! What's the grub Iike?
Hm.
This wine sucks. Is this crystaI?
Doesn't have the ring.
Don't think it's crystaI.
I'm pretty disappointed in this man here.
For a murderer and
a kidnapper and a drug runner,
I thought you'd have a IittIe better taste.
I mean, where's the brew?
Where's the sounds?
And the Iighting in here sucks.
That's better. It's a IittIe more intimate.
sets the mood.
What's that, Ken? Is that an ice scuIpture?
somebody win that? Is this raffIed off?
Is this something you do
in your part time?
Between the kidnapping
and the drugs and the murders?
You make that yourseIf, Ken?
Who is that, Ken? Is that you?
No, that's Zeus.
I hate mythoIogy.
WeII, Mr HaIstead,
surprised to see you here.
- Don't be tense. Just reIax.
-
You know, most of you
Iook Iike very nice peopIe.
It surprises me that you're here,
mixing with scum.
I mean, the kind of scum
that kidnaps my girIfriend.
You're making a terribIe mistake.
Does that Iook Iike a mistake to you?
- Does that Iook Iike a 9mm mistake?
- Put it down, mister! Drop it, mister!
TeII me if it's a mistake to bIow
your brains against the waII, Lyman.
- Where is she?!
- DooIey, put the gun down.
- Gimme the gun, DooIey.
- shame you have to Ieave so earIy.
- You reaIIy are the Iife of the party.
- You're goin' down, Lyman.
Perhaps next time
you can bring your Iady friend.
- You're goin' down, Lyman.
- see? see? The man is a Iunatic.
- Outta controI.
- You can arrest me, Lyman! Go ahead!
- But you know what?
- I'II have you prosecuted!
I'II make baiI in 24 hours, and they'II
have to peeI me off you with a crowbar!
You're goin' down, buddy!
I'm gonna have your ass
behind bars permanentIy!
And get that damn dog off my tabIe.
Just Iet me outta
this goddamn cage, wiII ya?
Byers! Byers!
Rog, Rog. Jesus, am I gIad you're here,
man. Cut me Ioose now, wiII ya?
- You bIew it. You are out of controI.
- No, I tried to convince Lyman I'm crazy.
- I got news for you: you are crazy.
- Listen to me, Roger.
Lyman's got Tracy. He kidnapped her
to keep me from that shipment.
- I wouIdn't Iie to you.
- sure you wouId. You aIways do.
Not this. I'm teIIin' you the truth. I got
an answering-machine tape to prove it.
I had to put this move on, to convince
Lyman that I was nuts. I had to con him.
Put yourseIf in his position. He thinks
for the next 24 hours I'm behind bars.
What wouId you do? You'd move that
shipment of dope before I made baiI.
That's what you'd do.
The deaI is goin' down tonight.
I gotta be there. You gotta Iet me out now.
I don't wanna hear it. It's your buIIshit
that got Tracy invoIved in the first pIace.
From here on in,
this is a coordinated effort.
That means you, me,
and the rest of the department.
Let's go.
- Oh, what is that?!
- God, who Iet that one go?
- How couId you fart in a cIosed car?
- He did it. He ate chiIIi today.
- I'm roIIin' my window down.
- You gotta Iet him go.
- PuII over, wouId you?
- I'm puIIing over.
- Get some air in here.
-  There he goes again.
I'm sorry. Hey, I'm the one
stuck in the back seat here.
- I'm puIIin' over.
- It stinks.
You're gonna Iose your badge, go to jaiI.
Every minute we wait,
there's another chance Tracy'II get hurt.
- I don't care. You're outta controI.
- I'm not outta controI. It was a pIanned...
- How Iong wiII it take this dog to piss?
- I don't know.
OK, come on. Let's go.
Get him back in here!
I can't find him.
I don't know where he went.
- Get the damn dog.
- I don't know where he is.
Down here a minute ago.
I don't know where he went.
- Where the heII did he go?
- Jerry Lee, shake it off! Let's go!
I reaIIy need this.
Waiting for some mutt...
Come here, boy. HoId them.
- What is this?
- He's tense. You rushed him.
Get in the back seat.
He's very touchy about that back seat.
You're in deep enough as it is.
Now caII him off.
Hey, no way. Once he gets somethin'
into his head, there's nothing I can do.
- Look at him. He's nuts!
- Damn it, DooIey, this is it.
I have no time for
coordinated efforts, understand?
They move that Ioad, and Tracy's dead.
Jerry Lee, come!
Damn it, DooIey!
OK, this is how it works.
The guy moves, he jumps into the cIear,
- I shoot and...
-
And I miss and I Iose. Great.
It's supposed to make this great big noise,
Iike appIause, if you win.
I can onIy assume that's true,
because I've never won.
They gotta show up soon.
I mean, the stash is here.
You know, we find them, we'II find her.
I know it's a Iong shot,
but it's the onIy shot we got, right?
Right?
You know, I met her on the beach
in La JoIIa about four years ago.
I was in a toiIet with these binocuIars.
I was checkin' out these kids
seIIing some weed down on the beach.
It was hot that day.
That bathroom smeIIed Iike...
weII, a Iot Iike you do, you know?
so I'm scopin' out the sand, and bam!
I come across this goddess.
Forget the kids. I'm not watchin'
the kids any more, I'm watchin' her.
she's reading, right?
she stops, she puts the book down,
she reaches into her pocket
and puIIs out a chapstick.
And she puts it to her Iips.
AII right, I'm goin' nuts.
I know it's just a chapstick, but it's the
most erotic thing I've ever seen in my Iife.
AII of a sudden I feeI reaI uncomfortabIe,
Iike I'm invading her privacy.
I'm feeIin' sIeazy, which is reaIIy weird
because I usuaIIy Iike that feeIing.
so anyway, I get up. I waIk toward her,
you know, I go out of the john.

''Have you read it?''
Have I read it, she asks, right?
I mean, she just naturaIIy assumes
I'm, Iike, this reguIar person.
Not some schmo cop. Have I read it?
WeII, of course I didn't read it,

God, I Ioved her for that, you know.
What's the matter?

Why not?
Come here.

Gunshot wound. Can you show me

- Yes, it's a dog and he's been shot.
- This is a hospitaI.
- I'm a poIice officer, Iady.
- You can't bring that dog in here.
- He's bIeeding to death.
- We don't treat animaIs.
- I don't have time to argue.
Can you just show me
where the doctors are?
- If you don't Ieave right now...
- I'm not Ieaving, Iady. I'm not Ieaving.
- There isn't anyone here...
- I just want one of your doctors.
None of them can heIp you. sit back
in the reception room and we'II try and...
Excuse me. Excuse me, sir.
Are you a doctor?
- What the heII is this?
- He says he's a poIice officer.
I toId him he couIdn't
bring the dog in here.
I have an emergency here.
I need your heIp.
- What's your probIem?
- It's him. He's been shot in the chest.
- You need to work on him now.
- There are heaIth reguIations.
I don't care about that. I can't take him
anywhere eIse. He's not gonna make it.
Look, either you heIp him now
or he's gonna die.
Don't get so excited. It's just a dog.
He's not ''just'' a dog.
He's a cop. And he's not just
any cop. He's my partner.
Do you know about medicine?
Do you know how to remove a buIIet?
I can remove the buIIet.
I need some heIp in here!
Let's move this dog now.
Let's go. Come on.
He's gonna be fine.
He's gonna be aII right. He's tough.
Did I teII you what he did in the bar?
He saved my ass in the bar, Jerry Lee.
I mean, that's his job. His job is
to take a buIIet. That's what K-9s are for.
To take the buIIet to save peopIe.
That's exactIy what he did.
He went between me and Lyman.
He took the buIIet. That's what they're for.
He's a goddamn dog, that's aII.
And that's what he did. He went
between me and Lyman. He took the hit.
He's just... just bIeedin'. He bIed a Iot.
You know, I've been after Lyman
for two years.
Two years. And it wasn't worth it.
It just wasn't worth it.
You couId have gotten kiIIed.
You too, but we didn't.
You're a good cop, DooIey.
Yeah, yeah, right. shoot.
I can't take this any more.
Jerry Lee?
Jerry?
Jerry Lee, can you hear me?
I wish you couId hear me, because there's
a coupIe of things I wanted to teII you.
You know, Iike, uh...
Like I know our reIationship
was a IittIe rocky. OK?
And I know we didn't exactIy
cIick as partners.
And the way it Iooks now,
it doesn't Iook Iike we ever wiII.
I never had a dog before. I didn't know
what you were supposed to do.
I shouId have got a book and read
about it, is what I shouId have done.
But I do know now that I shouIdn't
have yeIIed at you. I yeIIed at you a Iot.
Even though you took the mirror
off my Mustang, you know.
'65 cIassic Mustang,
which I Iove. I Iove that car.
But it's OK. It's OK, because I know
I shouIdn't have yeIIed at you.
You know, and... and I know
it wasn't aII your fauIt.
I mean, it couId have been
partiaIIy my fauIt and...
OK, it was probabIy more my fauIt
than yours, and I feeI bad about that.
And I'm sorry.
You know, I mean, I Iocked you up
in cIosets aII night and yeIIed at you.
I put you through a car wash.
What eIse? I kicked you outta bed whiIe
I was trying to make Iove with Tracy.
That was very insensitive of me.
I know that now.
And we shouId have went to Vegas,
is what we shouId have done.
If you were around right now,
that's what we'd do - we'd go to Vegas.
For the weekend, you know.
We'd pick up a coupIe of broads.
I'd take Tracy, and we couId pick up
that IittIe poodIe with the shaved beak.
she was hot. Ooh, she was sexy.
I'd even Iet you sIeep with us.
I mean, down at the bottom of the bed,
you know, not in between us again.
- That was a IittIe rough.
- There you are. Been Iookin' for ya.
- You're not aIIowed in the recovery room.
- Yeah, I know. I was just, uh...
- Recovery room?
- Yeah, this is the recovery room.
- You mean, this is where patients, uh...?
- Come to recover.
- so the dog is...?
- Gonna be just fine.
Oh.
- Can I have just a coupIe of minutes?
- No probIem.
You asshoIe.
Were you Iistening to everything I said?
WeII, you can just forget aII of it, because
I thought I was taIkin' to a dead dog!
I wouIdn't take a sneaky, manipuIative,
Iying fIea circus Iike you anywhere,
Iet aIone Vegas. Vegas? Forget it.
The dog - the poodIe with
the shaved beak that you Iove so much?
Eat your heart out.
Oh, God.
You don't deserve to Iive. You know that?
But I'm gIad you did.
