Whew! Well, Naomi,
here we are.
My favorite view
of the city.
You were right, Elena.
It was
worth the hike,
even if there
was no path.
Well, there used
to be one.
But I haven't been
up here in 41 years.
Oh, right.
You were stuck
in that amulet.
Yes. That's kind of why
I wanted to come up here.
There's something
I need to show you.
What is that?
This wand belonged
to Shuriki,
the sorceress
who invaded Avalor.
The one who put you
in that amulet?
Sort of.
It's time I told you
the whole story--
how I lost everything
and everyone I loved,
and how I finally
found my way back home.
The truth is, I would
still be trapped in
that amulet today
if it wasn't for
a brave young princess
named Sofia.
Mama, Papa!
You okay, Sof?
That was weird.
It was like
I just had a dream,
but I was
wide awake.
It's called daydreaming.
I do it all the time.
Children,
as I was saying,
I hope you all
have a wonderful summer.
Class is dismissed.
-
-
Have your steward
write my steward.
Oh, I can't wait
to find out
where Daddy is taking us
for our summer trip.
Come along, Sofia.
Yeah, we better get home.
And I better get to
the secret library.
KING ROLAND: The kids will
be here any minute, Miranda.
We have to figure out
where we're taking them.
What about Corinthia?
I was hoping to go someplace
we haven't been before.
The kingdom could use
a new trading partner.
We're home!
So, where are
we going, Daddy?
We're still trying
to figure that out, Amber.
I wish to be small.
Like the Amulet of Avalor?
Exactly like
the Amulet of Avalor.
Don't be so alarmed.
I know I am not the first
talking book you've seen here.
Usually, they just
tell the stories.
They don't talk to me.
Well, this book was made
by a powerful wizard.
Who?
Me. Alacazar.
The royal wizard of Avalor.
Well, I was
a royal wizard,
before I turned myself
into a talking book.
Why did you do that?
It is a long story,
which I am
about to tell you,
so get comfy.
Whoa!
Across the great ocean,
in the enchanted kingdom
of Avalor,
there once lived
a young princess named Elena.
so that her family
would be spared.
I saw this before
in my daydream.
That was Elena's way
of calling you here,
so I could tell you
the whole story.
And that is how the princess
wound up inside your amulet.
There's a princess
inside my amulet?
And she's been there
for 41 years.
But this is
the most important part.
Shuriki thought she had
gotten rid of Elena,
but she was wrong.
so that someday, her story
could have a happy ending.
And at last,
it seems Elena
finally found the princess
we have been searching for.
She chose me?
You catch on quickly.
I like that.
Now, in order to find Elena,
you must travel to
my home in Avalor,
and summon my chanul.
Wait. I have to do what?
Go to my home in Avalor
and summon my chanul.
But be careful,
for Queen Shuriki
still rules Avalor,
and is as powerful
and evil as ever.
So you probably want to
keep your distance.
I can see
you are unsure.
Listen, Elena tested
many princesses before you.
She granted them
powers and curses,
but you are
the only one she chose,
and she has been
preparing you for this day
since you first
put on the amulet.
So you can do this
if you choose to.
Her story is in
your hands now, Sofia.
It is up to you
how it ends.
I don't care where
the dart landed, James.
We are not going
to the North Pole.
I know where
we should go.
We should go to Avalor.
- What?
- Avalor?
That's so far away.
And we need to visit
a kingdom we can trade with.
I just read all about it,
and Avalor is the perfect
place for all of us.
You say you wanna go
somewhere new
Well, I have just
the new kingdom for you
A special place
that we all can explore
So let me tell you
about Avalor
It's where everyone
goes to trade
We can shop in
their grand arcade
It has plenty of
sights to see
And ancient ruins
of mystery
And beautiful scenery
So let's get out
of our royal home
And all set out
for the great unknown
We'll chart a course
of our very own
And take a leap into
the great unknown
The great unknown
Avalor sounds great.
What an adventure
it could be.
And good for the kingdom.
Just as long as
we get to go shopping.
We'll take
the royal galleon.
Across the ocean
as I set sail
I'm hoping
that I won't fail
To find a princess
I've never met
And end
my biggest story yet
And free her from
my amulet
So let's get out
of our royal home
And all set out
for the great unknown
Maybe pick up
a brand-new throne
Let's take a leap
Into the great unknown
The great unknown
As the trade winds
begin to blow
There's so much
that I still don't know
To free this princess
all on my own
Is such a leap
A journey deep
Into the great unknown
SAILOR: Land ho!
We're here!
Amber, wake up.
What's going on?
Where are we?
We're in Avalor.
Ease the mainsail!
Attention!
Quite a sight,
is it not?
The kingdom of Avalor.
SOFIA: How am I going to find
Alacazar's house
in that huge city?
ROLAND: Good morning,
Admiral Vazquez.
Your Majesty.
Have you sent word of
our arrival to Queen Shuriki?
- We sent a launch
an hour ago.
- Excellent.
Why did you do that?
It's the royal custom
to greet the king or queen
when visiting
a new kingdom, Sofia.
We have to meet her?
Yes. Isn't it exciting?
Queen Shuriki!
Oh! Don't sneak up
on me like that, Esteban.
Can't you see I'm
putting on my best face
for our visitors?
Oh, should I come back
when you are finished?
I am finished.
Of course you are,
my queen. My mistake.
It is time to greet
King Roland of Enchancia.
Everything must look
its absolute best, Armando.
Yes, Your Grace.
I have spent years making this
the cleanest, quietest,
most orderly kingdom
in the world.
Nothing is out of place,
everyone does
what they're told,
no unruliness.
No irritating jingle-jangle
of bells or music.
Just simple peace and quiet.
No one will make
a peep, Your Grace.
Except the cheers
of my subjects, of course.
And the cheering crowds
will be cheering this time,
correct, Esteban?
We sent the royal guards
ahead to offer encouragement.
Perfect.
Hello. Hello.
This is quite a welcome.
I'll say.
Hello. Hello!
They really like me.
Oh, they like her
even more.
I'd keep my distance,
Amber.
Yes, your beloved queen
has arrived.
Cheer like you mean it.
Welcome to Avalor.
I am Queen Shuriki.
And I am
Chancellor Esteban.
Oh, it is an honor
that you have chosen to visit
our humble kingdom.
You honor us with such a warm
reception, Queen Shuriki.
That is the Avaloran way,
King Roland.
Oh, what pretty music.
Now let us adjourn
to the palace.
Esteban, the flute.
Hey!
After you, princess.
The palace was built
centuries ago.
It's a little busy,
if you ask me.
And this is
my throne room.
I spend most of
my time here.
So what do you think?
That's quite a throne.
Thank you.
Took them over a decade
to dig up all the diamonds.
But it was worth the wait.
Don't touch that!
James, where are
your manners?
It's a very delicate fabric.
Come along, my boy.
You must all be famished
after such a long journey,
so I... I mean, the queen,
had the chefs prepare
a small taste
of the local cuisine.
MIRANDA: Oh, it's such
a lovely view
from up here,
Queen Shuriki.
I can't wait to go
back down to the city
and look at
all the beautiful old houses.
Old houses?
That's the last thing
you should be looking at, dear.
Our marketplace
and park lands
are second to none.
Esteban, clear my schedule.
I shall personally
give our guests
a tour of the city
this afternoon.
Hey, hey,
what's for lunch, Shuriki?
What are those?
Oh, those are jaquins.
Magical creatures
of legend.
Majestic symbols
of Avalor.
They used to be
symbols of our kingdom.
Now they are
just a nuisance.
Why is that?
Because we sing.
Ha ha!
From the misty
jungle highlands
We fan our wings
and fly
To delight
all Avalorans
With our mighty
jaquin cry
They're singing!
Can you believe
that, Sofia?
Talking animals!
Who ever heard of
such a thing?
Let's dig in,
Oh, ho, ho,
that looks tasty.
LUNA: Hey, save room for
dessert, Skylar.
My compliments to the chef
and whoever said
you should eat outside,
'cause that is
a great idea!
Brilliant.
Oh, shoo.
Get out of here, you pests.
Aw, but we just
got here.
You can tell the people
what to do,
but you can't
boss us around.
Mess with a jaquin,
you get the claws.
That's it.
Enough is enough.
Let's finish our meal
inside, shall we?
Yes, yes.
Let's all go inside.
Mmm. Food tastes better
when we take it from Shuriki.
It's paw-licking good.
LUNA: This mango
is sublime.
Um, excuse me.
Hey, what are you
still doing out here?
I'm not exactly sure,
but maybe you can help me.
We do not help
friends of Shuriki.
I'm not her friend.
My family
had to visit the palace.
I really came here
to find Alacazar's house.
Who's Alacazar?
He was the old royal wizard.
Remember?
Oh, yeah.
Didn't he split after
Shuriki took over?
Who can blame him?
She probably would've
zapped him
like the king and queen,
and Princess Elena.
- So young.
- So brave.
- Poor Elena.
Well, what if I told you
I know a way
to bring Princess Elena back?
You better not be
toying with me, little girl,
because I am highly emotional
and extremely gullible.
I'm telling the truth.
So if one of you knows
where Alacazar's house is,
maybe you could
take me there.
Whoa ho now,
what do we look like,
flying horses?
Do you see a saddle
on this back?
Relax, you two.
- What's your name?
- Sofia.
Well, Sofia, if you can
bring back Elena,
I'll take you
to Alacazar's house,
as soon as someone
tells me where it is.
It's right below
the moon cliff.
One of the old timers
showed me once.
Hop on,
Your Highness.
Thanks.
This is gonna take
some getting used to.
Hold on!
Your kingdom is beautiful.
It looked even better
before Shuriki took over.
Sure did.
And sounded better, too.
What do you mean?
- She outlawed music.
- Why?
Because she wanted
everyone to forget
the old Avalor.
That's why we jaquins
still sing.
To remind everyone that
the spirit of Avalor lives on.
And 'cause it really
bugs Shuriki.
Way back in
the old days
Before the time of
Shuriki
You could always
hear music
In the streets
of the city
Although now
it is quiet
And the bells
are not ringing
If you listen
real closely
You can hear
our hearts singing
All across
the kingdom
The people
are still strong
Because the spirit
of Avalor
Continues to live on
Yes, every man and woman
Everyone, everywhere
Even children
do their parts
To uphold the spirit
of Avalor
With a song
inside their hearts
Avalor, Avalor
They uphold
the spirit of Avalor
With a song
inside their hearts
The queen
hushes their voices
But we gladly
sing for them
-  The guards,
they do not like it
- No, they don't.
- But we simply ignore them
- Yes, we do.
We all yearn for
the day when
That old queen
is sent packin'
And you'll hear
better music
-  Than the sound
of us jaquins
- That's for sure!
All across
the kingdom
The people
are still strong
Because the spirit
of Avalor
Continues to live on
Yes, every man and woman
Everyone, everywhere
Even children
do their part
To uphold
the spirit of Avalor
With a song
inside their hearts
Avalor, Avalor
From the parrots
in their treetops
To the merchants
in their carts
We feel
the spirit of Avalor
Way down deep inside
our hearts
Everyone, everywhere
We hold
the spirit of Avalor
Avalor, Avalor
With a song
inside our hearts
Avalor, Avalor
This is it.
Whew!
That was a workout.
Hello. Can I help you?
Hi. Uh, was this
Alacazar's house?
Alacazar? I'm sorry,
but he has not lived here
for many years.
I know, but maybe
you can help me.
I need to summon his chanul.
I don't know
what that is,
but I'm afraid
you won't find it here.
Good day now.
Well, that could've
gone better.
How do you know
what a chanul is?
Oh, well...
That was my mom
you were just talking to.
I'm Mateo.
Wait. You're Alacazar's
grandson?
You know my grandfather?
Uh, sort of.
My name is Sofia.
I know this might
sound strange,
but your grandfather
sent me here
to free Princess Elena.
Princess Elena?!
Wait. That means...
that's the Amulet
of Avalor.
Yes. How did you know?
My mother told me
the story so many times,
I memorized it.
Follow me.
- Where are we going?
- To my workshop.
Wish me luck.
It's a long way down.
I know, but it's
the only way
to keep
everything secret.
When Queen Shuriki
took over,
she banned all magic
except her own.
So there are no wizards
in Avalor?
Not anymore.
My grandma hid
all my grandpa's
things down here,
but my mother never wanted
anything to do with it.
So it sat here
all locked up
until I found it.
I've been trying to teach
myself magic ever since.
Okay, now let me think.
I just need a few things.
Okay, sit here, Sofia.
Why?
We're going to summon
my grandpa's chanul.
What is a chanul exactly?
A spirit animal.
It's like a guide to
all the magical stuff
in the world
that we can't see,
like Princess Elena.
It was my grandpa's chanul
who figured out
she was in the amulet
and told him how
to get her out.
Here we go.
Now where's my tamborita?
Okay, this is the first time
I've tried this incantation,
so it may not work for the first
eight or nine times.
Maybe ten. Ahem.
Appear to us,
animal spirit of Alacazar.
It's okay.
I have another
drumstick.
Let's try that again.
Huh?
What's happening?
I am.
Greetings from
the spirit world!
How ya doin' today?
O mighty chanul,
you honor us
with your presence.
Hey, I know you're excited.
I get it.
It's not every day
you meet a spirit animal, right?
But you called me,
I'm here,
so we can skip
all the fanfare,
and get on with it, okay?
Of course, mighty chanul.
Oh, you can
call me Zuzo.
Yes, of course,
mighty Zuzo.
You don't have to
call me anything.
So, you're the princess
that's gonna free Elena.
I guess so.
All right then.
Now here's what
you gotta do.
Wait. I thought I just
had to summon you.
Uh-huh, so I can tell you
how to get her out.
That's what
spirit guides do.
They guide you.
First, you're gonna
need the wand
that put Elena in there.
Queen Shuriki's wand?
But she keeps it
in her pocket.
That's great.
You'll know exactly
where to find it.
Now, once you've got the wand,
you just wrap
the amulet around it
and put 'em on
the crown of Aziluna.
- The crown of who?
- Aziluna.
He was a great healer who could
undo any spell or curse.
There's an ancient Maruvian
statue of him
way up in the mountains.
It's kinda like a hospital
for magical mishaps.
But I don't know where it is,
or how to get there,
or how I'm going to steal
Shuriki's wand.
Okay, let's all
take a big breath.
In. Out. Good.
Now I've got some
spirit animal wisdom for you.
Just because
you're the one
doesn't mean you're
the only one.
That's not supposed to
make any sense right now.
You'll get it later.
But first, you gotta
go get that wand, princess.
All right, it's been a pleasure
being your spirit guide today.
Safe travels. Bye.
How great was that?!
I summoned
my first chanul!
Sorry. Whoa!
Hey, nice move. I bet you're
a good dancer, aren't you?
That's how I'll
get her wand.
I'll dance with her.
That won't work.
Shuriki outlawed dancing
when she banned music.
My mom still taught me
the sambarosa, though.
- We have to go
back to the palace.
- We?
ARMANDO: And when the farmer
followed her into the jungle,
she turned into
a jaguar!
But really, she was
a wicked witch
who had taken over
the jungle.
The farmer tried
to escape...
Our kingdom has
a wide array of
enchanted agriculture,
and creatures,
not to mention
our flying horses.
Forget trading
with Enchancia.
We should invade it.
Here you are,
princess.
You were out there
a while, Sofia.
The jaquins
sang me a song.
Yes, they can't seem
to stop doing that.
Well, Armando
is putting on a show
for the other little darlings
if you want to join them.
Actually, I was hoping
to learn
one of the Avaloran
dances I've heard so much about.
The sambarosa.
Oh, I'm afraid
I don't know that dance.
It's the most famous
dance in Avalor.
I can teach it to her.
No, you won't, Armando.
More tea, Your Grace?
Why not? Is there some kind
of law against dancing?
Sofia, no one would
pass a law against dancing.
That's like passing
a law against fun.
Well, in Avalor, we--
We only dance on
special occasions,
like royal visits.
So we will be happy to
show you the sambarosa.
Right, Your Grace?
If we must.
Let me fetch the guitar.
Great.
This is how you dance
the sambarosa.
You join hands
and stomp your feet like this.
Move back and forth,
then twirl your partner.
Whoo!
Come on.
Everyone try!
Queen Shuriki,
will you dance with me?
Oh, how sweet of you
to offer,
but I'm having
too much fun watching you.
But I'm sure you dance
better than anyone.
Please?
How can I say no
to such a dear child?
Ow!
So sorry, Your Grace.
I'm so clumsy.
Enough dancing!
I mean, so delightful.
We really must
get back to our discussions,
Your Majesties.
Can we play
hide-and-seek?
Yes, yes, yes.
Whatever you want, dear.
We can dispose of that
now, Esteban.
Sofia, I don't wanna play
hide-and-seek.
It'll be fun, Amber.
Is it okay if we hide
and you seek, Mr. Armando?
Oh, of course.
That would be
delightful.
Okay. One, two, three, four...
Come on.
Five, six, seven, eight...
What are you
up to, Sofia?
I'll explain later,
but I need you both to hide
as long as you can.
It's important.
- You got it, Sof.
- Why won't you tell us?
It's for your own
good, trust me.
Hmm.
I got it!
Right on, Sofia!
I don't know how
you pulled that off.
Shuriki never lets anyone
get close to her.
Look at her.
Girl looks sweet as sugar,
but she's got some skills.
Okay, Mateo, show us the way
to Aziluna.
We've got a princess
to free.
SOFIA: What's that?
An old Maruvian temple.
The statue is inside.
Whoa, man, they really
let the place go.
The Maruvians vanished
centuries ago.
No one knows what
happened to them
or where they went.
All that's left of
the ancient civilization
of Maru are ruins like this.
SOFIA:
Where's the statue?
Well, legend has it
you need to swim across
the enchanted waters
for the magic to work.
You'll be fine, Sofia.
Good luck.
Okay.
Being a mermaid would
really come in handy
right about now.
Whoa! Did you see that?
I wish I could
shape shift that easily.
That must be it.
Right. I have to put
the amulet and wand
on the crown of Aziluna.
Whoa!
Whoa!
My amulet.
It changed color.
Princess Elena?
I'm free!
I'm finally free!
Whoa!
- Are you okay?
- I'm good.
I'm good.
I guess that's what happens
when you're stuck inside
an amulet for 41 years.
You forget how to walk.
I knew you were the one!
Thank you.
You're... welcome.
Princess Elena!
Oh, jaquins.
Princess Elena.
Princess Elena!
I'm Mateo.
Alacazar's grandson.
Oh, you don't have to bow,
Mateo.
And you can just
call me Elena.
Okay, Elena.
I can't believe
you're really back.
Neither can I.
I was in the amulet so long,
I thought I might
never get out.
But here I am.
It feels so weird
Having my feet
on the ground
It's been a while since
I've been walking around
With my own eyes,
I can once again see
My dream has come true
I am free
But now that I'm here,
there's a mission at hand
To drive that witch
out of our beautiful land
I'll banish the darkness
and bring back the light
'Cause this time
I'm ready to fight
This is my time
My time to face
my old foe
My time
Reclaim what was ours
long ago
This is my time
To stand up
with honor and pride
My time
I've come too far
To be denied
Now off I must fly
to the palace once more
To win back the freedom
of all Avalor
I've spent my whole life
waiting just for this day
And nothing will
get in my way
This is my time
I have a plan
that can't fail
My time
I won't stop
till I prevail
My time
To honor
my family and friends
My time
This is my time
once again
This is my time
Once again
Okay, I'll see you
back in the city.
Where are you going?
To give Shuriki
a taste of her own magic.
But Queen Shuriki
is really powerful.
Not without her wand.
Wait. I'll come with you.
- Me, too.
- No.
No. You've already
risked so much for me.
This is something
I have to do alone.
Let's go.
We've got to help her.
Let's go.
Right. Go, Luna.
Catch that princess.
LUNA: Let's do it!
Where are those children?
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.
Any of you.
Please.
You want me
to go with you?
Thanks, but I've got this.
The trade agreement
is ready
for your signature,
Your Grace.
Done. Now that
that's taken care of...
ELENA: Shuriki!
- Huh?
- Huh?
Princess Elena!
The time has come
to pay for your crimes.
Crimes?
What crimes?
Shuriki invaded Avalor,
and overthrew
the royal family.
My family.
Is this true?
Oh, Elena.
Some inherit
their kingdoms.
Others have to take
theirs by force.
Hey!
Then I'm here
to take mine back.
But Avalor has been
so much better without you.
Why ruin a good thing?
Looking for this?
How did you get that?
It was that little princess.
The one with
the necklace.
Wait. Sofia's
involved in this?
Yes. She freed me
from her amulet,
so that I could free Avalor
from you.
Oh, I don't know
about that.
It takes more than
a wand to make you
a sorceress.
Your spell has echoed in my mind
for 40 years, Shuriki.
I know it by heart.
You'll have to do
better than that.
What is this?
I've never seen
this painting before.
Oh, that's no
ordinary painting, Elena.
That's how Alacazar
protected your little
sister and grandparents--
inside an enchanted painting
even my magic cannot touch.
Isabel.
And speaking of family,
you haven't said hello to
your cousin Esteban.
No.
This cannot be Esteban.
You were stuck in
that amulet a long time.
You may still be 16,
but Esteban grew up.
Wait. You're with her?
I... I had
no choice, Elena.
Is that so, Esteban?
Seize her!
Found ya!
Oh!
Uh, what's going on?
Nothing, Armando.
I'm just setting things
back in order.
Hey, not so fast, Shuriki!
Hop on, Elena.
No, wait.
Don't leave, Skylar.
Guards, stop them!
I want her captured
by nightfall.
Her and that
little princess.
Leave Sofia out of this.
And lock them up
while you're at it.
MIRANDA: Get your hands
off me!
You'll regret this.
I doubt it.
Wait. Wait.
Skylar, we have to go back.
Why? So she can
finish you off?
You are brave, princess,
but your battle strategy,
not so good.
Elena, what happened?
I tried my best, Sofia,
but I couldn't
get the spell right,
and Shuriki
has your family now.
She has my family?
I'm so sorry.
There she is.
Archers, lock your arrows.
Draw!
Whoa. They're
shooting arrows!
Evasive action.
Dodge and weave.
Yeah, we could do that.
Or we could just
get on up outta here.
- We can go to my place.
- Great. Hang on.
Oh, I hope they're okay.
This is not okay, Roland.
Where is Sofia?
I will get us
out of here, Miranda,
and we will find Sofia.
The prisoners are secured,
Chancellor Esteban.
Those prisoners are royalty,
and you will
treat them as such.
Yes, chancellor.
Ay yi yi.
Yet another mess to clean up.
So Princess Elena lives.
Apparently so.
She is the rightful
heir to the throne.
We should be
helping her.
What do you suggest
do, hmm?
Fight the queen?
Because we will lose.
But Elena's
your cousin, Esteban.
And her grandparents
raised me like a son.
And I think about
what happened to them
every day.
So I do not need you
to remind me, Armando.
Elena, what happened
back there?
I never knew
what happened
to my sister
and my grandparents
until today.
Seeing them trapped
in that painting
reminded me of
the last time I saw Isabel.
- Isabel?
- My little sister.
She'd been out in
the garden all day,
building a new feeder
for the jaquins.
She was filthy,
and our parents were
on their way home for dinner,
so I asked her to change.
And she comes back
wearing a clean dress,
but her hands and face
are still covered in dirt.
I had just finished
cleaning her off
when I heard our parents'
carriage pull up outside.
And then,
Shuriki arrived.
I'm sorry.
When I saw her in
that enchanted painting today,
she still had
a smudge on her cheek.
I guess I missed a spot.
We have the spell
that can get them out.
- We do?
- We do.
Your grandfather
showed me where it was
before he left,
but I never learned magic,
so I cannot
cast the spell.
You will have
to do it, Mateo.
And, uh, why would I
be able to do it?
Mateo, you're down there
in the basement
practicing magic
day and night.
You think
I don't know this?
But Elena,
I must warn you.
To bring them out
with Shuriki still in power
will put them
in great danger.
-
-
We have visitors.
Quick, hide, over there.
-
- Okay. Coming, coming.
Rafa, did you hear?
They're saying that
Princess Elena has returned.
Oh, hurry.
Hurry. Come inside.
We have to be careful.
Princess Elena,
it's okay.
We can trust them.
It is true.
The princess lives!
My princess.
You don't have to bow.
Oh, okay.
We are at your command.
I will take on
Shuriki myself.
Thank you,
all of you,
but this is my fight,
not yours.
I'm the one
who must face her.
You may be the one,
but you're not the only one.
Zuzo said that, and now
I know what he meant.
Okay. What did he mean?
We can all help.
You don't need
to face Shuriki alone.
You just need to tell us
what to do.
Hmm. You know,
all this time
I was stuck in the amulet,
I thought I was alone,
but you're right, Sofia.
It doesn't have to be that way.
I have all of you.
Yeah, but what good
are we against Shuriki
and all her soldiers?
I'm still
figuring that out,
but I'm going to need
everyone's help.
- We're with you.
- All the way.
Not just you.
Everyone.
Where are we?
A secret back entrance
to the palace.
Not that I ever snuck out
when I wasn't supposed to.
I'll see you at
the rendezvous point, Skylar.
You better.
How will we find
my family?
There's only one place
Shuriki would've put them.
Princess Elena?!
Hey there.
You look like a nice guy
who just wants to do
the right thing.
I do?
I mean, I do.
Whatever you need,
princess.
I am at your service.
Ahem. Excuse me,
but Queen Shuriki
wants the both of you
to report to her
right away.
I'll go.
You stay here.
No, but she asked
to see the both of you.
One of us has to
watch the prisoners.
Um, wait.
Hold on.
That hurts.
Oh, one of the guards
wouldn't leave.
Sofia, if you shrank down,
you could sneak
right past that guard.
But you're not
in my amulet anymore.
Do you think I still
have my powers?
There's only one way
to find out.
I wish I was small.
Armando, I need you
to distract the guard.
Hello. Excuse me.
Hello.
What is it now?
There's something
very, very important
I must tell you.
Over here.
I wish to be big again.
- Hi.
- ALL: Sofia!
Sh. We have to hurry.
You have a lot
of explaining to do.
Mom, I will... later.
I promise.
But right now, we have to find
a way to get past that guard.
I'll take care
of him.
And when the farmer
followed her into the jungle,
she turned into
a jaguar!
This is the important thing
you had to tell me?
You haven't heard
the ending yet.
Grab him!
Got him!
Well done.
Dad, this is
Princess Elena.
I'm sorry for the danger
I put your family in.
But I've waited
so many years
for the one princess that could
free me from the amulet,
and that was Sofia.
I sensed it from
the very first day
she moved into your castle.
So when I was picking out
Sofia's welcome gift,
it was you who made
the amulet glow?
Yes. I needed someone
young enough
to get close to Shuriki
without making her suspicious,
but brave and clever enough
to get me out.
So you shouldn't be
mad at her.
You should be proud.
Sofia, you still should've
told us what was going on.
I know. I just wanted to
keep you all out of trouble.
Well, it's
too late for that.
I think a pardon
may be in order just this once.
I have a plan to get you
all to safety,
but we have to hurry.
I'm losing my patience,
Esteban.
Where is Princess Elena?
Queen Shuriki,
when I helped you invade Avalor,
you promised me that no one
in my family would be hurt.
I also promised you power,
and look at you now,
Chancellor Esteban.
Just be happy I kept
one of my promises,
or you'll wind up like
your aunt and uncle.
You wanted to see me,
Your Grace.
I don't want to see
anyone until those
princesses are found.
Hey there, Shuriki.
Long time no see.
I've put up with you buzzards
outside, but not in my palace.
But it's so comfy
in here.
Ooh, here's a nice
little perch.
Get off my throne.
-
- Missed me!
Capture that beast.
You heard the queen.
Move!
Yes, sir.
Okay, let's see the spell.
Whoa.
Oh, boy,
that's a tongue twister.
ELENA: Mateo!
Oh, it's you.
Oh, Isabel!
You have to get them
out, Mateo.
Now.
Okay.
- Isabel!
- Elena!
I missed you so much.
Let me just...
You're safe.
The palace looks
so different.
- What happened to Shuriki?
- She's still here.
I never should've let
Alacazar put us in
that painting.
Uh, can we talk
about this later?
We have to go.
Everyone hurry.
Get on a jaquin.
Whoa, princess.
You should've given me
a head count.
Some of you may
have to double up.
These jaquins will take
your family back to your ship,
and we're taking
the others.
Since when do people
ride jaquins?
Don't get used to it.
I'm not running away
from Shuriki again, Elena.
We're not running
away,
You'll see.
I'm going to stay
and help Elena.
What? If I knew that,
I would've gotten on
another bird thingy.
We should help, too, Rollie.
I intend to,
but the children
should return to the ship
where it's safe.
We'll be okay, Dad.
We won't be alone.
Everyone's coming.
ROLAND: What do you mean,
everyone?
MAN: Come on.
We're going to the castle.
- Viva Avalor!
- ALL: Viva Avalor!
Hey, Shuriki.
I'm getting a little
lonely up here.
You again.
Too slow.
-
-
Missed me again.
You're gonna have to aim
better than that
if you're gonna zap me.
Oh, I will, you pest.
Oh. Uh-huh.
Nice shot, Shuriki.
Well, it's been a blast
distracting you,
- but I'm outta here.
- Distracting me?
What is she talking
about, Esteban?
-
- What?
What is that sound?
They're coming,
Your Majesty.
Who is coming?
All of Avalor.
Is that... singing?
So we will march
to the palace once more
To bring back the freedom
of all Avalor
We've spent our whole lives
waiting just for this day
And nothing,
no, nothing
Will stand in our way
This is our time
Together as one,
we won't fail
Our time
This time we know
we'll prevail
Our time
To honor
our family and friends
Our time
This is our time
Once again
- Halt!
- Stop right there.
I'll take care of them.
Brace yourself, Miranda.
They locked the gate.
We'll have to break it down.
Or we can fly around
the other side and open it.
That'll work, too.
Stay together.
Stay strong!
GUARD: Stand firm, men.
Stop in the name
of the queen.
Stop them!
- There's just too many.
- Retreat! Run!
I think I'll just
go over here now.
Cowards!
Enough!
Leave my palace
at once.
It's not your palace,
Shuriki.
It's ours, and you can't
stop all of us.
I don't have to.
I only need
to stop you.
Esteban!
What are you doing?
Elena, catch.
Ha! You can't use the wand
on me, girl.
Maybe so, but let's see
how powerful you are without it.
Shuriki, your reign
is over.
No.
She's gone, Elena.
We won.
After all these years.
All hail the rightful heir
of Avalor,
Princess Elena!
Wait. I'm in charge
of the kingdom now?
You are the eldest child.
The crown goes to you.
It does?
You will be
a great ruler, Elena.
And you'll have
your grandfather and I
to help you,
so there's nothing
to worry about.
Now go and address
your people.
Right.
Address my people.
Okay.
Hello. Hi.
How are you?
Hey there.
And thank you
for everything.
Elena, I guess
this belongs to you.
Sofia, I want you
to have it,
for all you've done
for Avalor.
Besides, I think I've
seen enough of that amulet
for a lifetime.
Thank you, Elena.
Thank you, cousin.
For a moment, I wasn't sure
whose side you were on.
I was always
on our side,
but I couldn't let
Shuriki find a way
to destroy that painting.
Our family was in there.
And so, I pretended
to follow her
to keep them safe.
I hope you understand, Elena.
- Elena!
- Isa!
Any time you need
a ride, princess,
I'm your jaquin.
Let every bell
in Avalor ring.
We are free!
- How was that?
- Great.
SOFIA:
Thus began the reign
of Princess Elena,
and with it, a new age
of joy and prosperity
for all of Avalor."
Wonderful.
I would call that
a very happy ending.
It is, but I don't think
her story is over just yet.
Of course it isn't,
but what happens next
is a tale for another book.
Thank you for
all you have done, Sofia.
And this is for
the journey ahead.
Which brings me to this.
I need to figure out
what to do with
the pieces of her wand.
Well, you could just
toss 'em off the cliff.
I was thinking of
something a little more secure.
I know.
You could...
No, that's too obvious.
Hmm.
I know. We can hide them
in the treasury,
and not tell anyone
where we put it.
Yes. It'll be
the best-guarded
secret in Avalor.
Thanks, Naomi.
What are friends
and Grand Counselors for?
So, should we
head back down?
Are you sure you don't
need more rest?
You are 57, after all.
Well, as my says,
time spent in magical jewelry
doesn't count.
Then we better go.
The kingdom's
not gonna rule itself.
Right.
