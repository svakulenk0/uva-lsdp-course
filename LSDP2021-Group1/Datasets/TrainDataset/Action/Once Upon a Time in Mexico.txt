I never heard of him.
Who?
The man you recommended.
The guitar fighter'?
Wiped out a couple towns single-handedly.
A real nut. Yeah.
You probably heard of him. You just didn't
know it was him they were talking about.
You should meet him.
Me. Me. That's me.
Just as long as I'm not the guy that
has to make the introduction, okay?
Were you here in Mexico during
the Barillo cartel massacre?
No.
Uhh.
That's when I first heard
about him. He was a legend.
They used to say he was the
biggest Mexican they'd ever seen.
That was total bullshit.
He was 5'9", 5'10", tops.
That's no record,
but bigger than most of us.
But Marquez,
that's a different story.
Marquez, he really had it in
for this Mariachi, see.
They called him "Mariachi"
because he used to carry this guitar.
A guitar?
Believe me, he really knew
how to play it too.
Look, this story is well-traveled.
It might have picked up some
embellishments along the way.
Just read between the lines.
Now, he may not have been
the biggest Mexican ever...
All right.
But she was as deadly
as she was beautiful.
There's a girl?
Oh, yeah. There's a girl.
When he'd run out of ammo,
she'd take over.
The most drop-dead gorgeous
woman you'll ever see.
That's where all the trouble began.
She was with Marquez.
And when Marquez saw that she was with
the Mariachi, well, he went crazy.
He hunted him down and fought
Mariachi to the death. And then she...
put a bullet in his heart.
Only he didn't die.
I don't know what happened after that.
Would you like some?
No. Maybe Marquez caught up
with them, or the cartels.
But like I said, the man
is a myth, a legend.
And if he's still living,
he's the one you want.
Well...
that is truly unbelievable.
Well, I'm not big on
telling stories.
Where's the money you owe me?
That's the reason I'm here.
I couldn't find a briefcase small
enough for $10,000 in cash.
It'll do.
Just for my own edification,
I offered you 50.
Why'd you say no?
I'm not a greedy man.
Not looking
to get rich quick.
Besides, 50,000 is a lot for what you
wanted me to find out, you know.
You may as just as well put a bullet
in my head as cough it up, right?
But 10?
Ten thousand is civilized.
Ten is something
we both can live with.
Ten might still be too much.
You'd kill me over $10,000?
You wouldn't dare.
You wouldn't dare.
Yes, I would.
Would you do me the honor?
You need to learn
to play.
That's why you're here.
I hear this
is a town of Gunmen.
We only make
guitars here.
Mariachi.
Which one?
I don't know who you mean.
I'm honored to be
in your presence.
But there's someone else who
wants to meet you.
No.
Keep it. He made that for you.
You know, if I was you, son,
I'd turn around and go back right now.
Go back to
where I came from.
Instead of selling my mind and
my soul to these Cocksuckers.
You speak English?
I didn't think so.
Come on.
Attempts have been made
on me and my family by the cartels.
The same cartels that are
threatening our freedom...
freedom which we must
defend to the death.
I present
to you Señor Blascoe.
Please sit.
We hear you want
to work for us.
I too am ready to start a new life.
This is your lucky day.
Did you order my
Does it have a name?
They call him "El."
As in "The."
I know what it means.
Thank you.
Alert the Barillo cartel
that  has come out of hiding.
I don't think we should--
Are you a Mexican...
I'm a Mexican.
Good.
Then do as I say.
Nice tune.
Something my brother taught me.
I killed him.
Yes, I was privy to that
information already. How charming.
You know, El,
if I may call you that.
I've been doing a little snooping
around, and it seems that the cartels
have quite a price
on your head.
I wouldn't want to be you.
Tell me, is there anyone
who doesn't want you dead?
You tell me.
I need you to kill a man.
El, you really must try this,
because it's puerco
It is a slow-roasted pork, nothing fancy.
It just happens to be my favorite,
and I order it with a tequila and lime
in every dive I go to in this country.
And honestly, that is the best
it's ever been anywhere.
In fact, it's too good.
It is so good that when I'm finished
with it, I'll pay my check,
walk straight into the kitchen
and shoot the cook.
Because that's what I do. I restore
the balance to this country.
And that is what I would like
from you right now.
Help me keep the balance
by pulling the trigger.
You want me to shoot the cook?
No, I'll shoot the cook.
My car's parked
out back anyway. You...
will kill Marquez.
Do you remember
General Marquez?
He's being paid
by the Barillo cartel
to kill the President
in an attempted coup d'état.
Attempted?
Oh, no, no.
The President will be killed,
because he's that piece of good pork
that needs to get balanced out.
I say "attempted" because we don't
want Marquez taking power.
I need you to put the hurting,
so to speak, on Marquez
after he's killed
the President. Savvy?
So why me?
Well, frankly, because
you've got nothing to live for,
and, in a way,
you're already dead.
And Marquez is the man
who killed you.
So why not return the favor?
Go to the church.
Meet with an associate
of mine named Salome at 3:00.
And I will contact you afterwards
if we have a deal.
Was I right?
I guess not.
MAN: The last shipment of guns
that were seized at our border
have not been
accounted for, Sanchez.
You are now off that assignment.
Who wants to volunteer?
Okay. You, Gomez, it's yours.
With el Presidente's new campaign
against the Barillo cartel,
their activities are being
pushed into the forefront.
Large payments, deliveries,
whispers of a political takeover.
I need new point men,
strong and willing.
This is a top priority of el Presidents.
Who wants this?
Romero, it's yours.
Pick your secondary person.
A third, if you have to.
That's all. Dismissed.
I should take his left nut.
You're with us.
People of Culiacan.
I've come here to bring you a
message of peace.
Peace that at this moment is being
threatened by a group of people
that is threatening our nation.
People like Armando Barillo.
I invite you to
gather our forces
in order to prevent the
destruction of our unity
and our peace.
Presidente, history teaches
us no matter how great your armies are,
you will always need
the favor of the inhabitants
to take possession of a province.
How can you compete with a man
like Barillo? He owns Culiacan.
He doesn't own its people.
Barillo has purchased hundreds
of homes and ranches
in the northern part of Culiacan.
And then he has turned around
and given these homes to the people.
He's a folk hero to them.
He's also a mass murderer
and a drug kingpin.
He's trying to make himself a martyr
by drawing the people to his side,
but the people can
see through that.
Men like Barillo have stolen
this country's soul.
But my people will stand up
for what is right.
I'm afraid they're no longer
your people, sir.
Then I will die fighting.
Are you with me?
To the death.
What's wrong?
Everything.
This way!
Come on, come on,
come on, come on!
Any suggestions, Miss "Why don't
we get a room on the fifth floor
so we can see
the beautiful sunset"?
Jump.
Swing, swing, swing.
Hang on!
What do you mean, hold on?
Let go now!
Give me that!
Stop the bus.
Stop the bus.
A vow must be broken.
Forgive me for what
I am about to become.
When was your last confession?
An hour ago.
And the name of your priest?
Sands.
Okay. You are expected to carry out
your assignment to the letter--
Yeah, yeah, I know.
Failure to appear
in designated locations
at assigned times
results in forfeit of protection,
protection you will definitely need.
Yeah.
You'll be paid.
Coup d'états, like elections,
don't come cheap.
So there's plenty of dough
floating around.
There's more.
You will be a free man,
from Marquez, the cartels,
and even from the President,
who isn't your biggest fan,
let's face it.
When do I begin?
Give me a moment.
MAN:
It's a church, hombre.
I'm sorry.
Are you still standing?
Still.
Good. Well, the Barillo cartel
aren't the nicest of guys, are they?
However, you've passed the test.
You're gonna do just fine.
Assemble your team, and I will
call you with further instructions.
I'm just walking my beat, friend.
Mexico's my beat, I'm walking it.
I throw shapes, and they catch them.
I set them up and watch them fall.
Have him meet me
at the bullfight, 5 p.m.
What?
Why? Why would I want that?
Why would I want bubble gum?
All right. All right.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Okay, this should hold the both
of us over for quite a long time.
So I don't ever
want to see you again.
Fuck off.
Hi.
Hello.
The CIA sharing a meal
with the FBI.
Now, if that isn't inter-agency
cooperation, I just don't know what is.
I'm retired FBI.
A real agent never retires.
He just takes it a little easier.
Why are we talking?
You tracked down Armando Barillo
for two years when he was running his
operations out of San Antonio. Is that correct?
Spinning wheels.
Never led to an arrest.
Well, he--
He is, in fact,
sitting directly behind you.
I know.
He settled back in.
He's been living here for six years.
Can't be touched.
Did you know that most agents
never even see a top-10 criminal
for their entire careers? You
brought down two, didn't you?
And now your third is sitting
in very close proximity.
Now, retired or not,
that has really got to tug
on the old short and curlies.
I'm a civilian now.
Didn't he kill that agent friend of yours?
What was his name, uh...
Archuleta?
Yes.
Barillo is a Mexican citizen.
He cannot be extradited for crimes
committed in the U.S.
Did you happen to know of a Dr. Guevera?
Worked for the cartel.
This doctor pumped your friend Archuleta
full of drugs, day after day,
so that they could torture him
for two weeks before he died.
You must have known that.
Dr. Guevera himself
having dinner with your prey.
I wonder what it is
they're up to now.
Two weeks of torture, Jorge.
Think about that.
For your dead friend...
for the job you didn't finish
in San Antonio.
Now, are you really going
to let it slip away again?
I'd like you to have a bite
of my pork, because it's...
the world.
ANNOUNCER :
It's Mariachi Happy Hour!
Get your Mariachi song for 5 pesos.
A Mariachi kiss for 20 pesos.
And a Mariachi fuck
for only 50 pesos!
Where the
hell have you been?
Far away.
Still fucking around?
Let me get Fideo.
I'm here for my guitar.
It's his last night.
LORENZO:
They're firing him.
Hey...
Fideo, it's me.
Still drinking. Like a fish
I guess we haven't
changed so much.
LORENZO: I didn't think you'd
ever come back for this thing.
Neither did I.
Are we on?
I'll let you know.
I'll let you know.
Bring him sober.
We're gonna need him, so...
coffee.
Lots of coffee.
SANDS: Sometimes a revolution
is exactly what is needed
to clean up the system.
One...
giant enema, which just so happens
to be my area of expertise.
Bullfights. Bull hockey.
Do you like this?
The bull is stabbed,
prodded, beaten.
The bull is wounded. The bull
is tired before the matador
ever steps into the ring.
Now, is that victory?
Of course it is.
Wanna know
the secret to winning?
Creative sportsmanship.
In other words...
One has to rig the game.
Go collect.
speech
on the
in the town of Culiacan.
He's going to be isolated
in the main edificio
in the center of the plaza.
Very easy access to him if...
somebody can get you in.
Right. You're the man
who can do that.
I am not the prince.
I am the man behind the prince.
I see.
He's not the first prince I've served,
nor the first one
that I've betrayed.
You're a good rat. I like you.
I try.
The rest upon
completion.
Mucho gusto.
Right. Right.
Every goddamn time.
What do you want in life?
SANDS:
Belini...
how long have you and I
done business together?
A long time.
And in a way...
I kind of, almost, could have the
tiniest smidgen of respect for you.
Almost.
But you need to stop
farting around.
Now, do you have the information
that I need on Barillo or do you not?
I have what you need.
I'm just enjoying this
temporary position of power.
That make you nervous?
You know that withholding vital
information from a federal officer
is a serious offense.
Especially when that officer
has paid handsomely for it
and wouldn't think twice about
ripping that patch off your eyehole
and skull-fucking you
to death.
WAITRESS: Más
No.
I'm fine. Go away.
I am fine. Go away.
You're off the hook.
Leave me alone.
That spill just
cost you your life.
A little help.
Okay-
I know it's on you somewhere.
Somewhere.
All right.
Time to get messy.
Well, I suppose I should thank you
for not sticking it up your ass.
However.
You're about a quart low.
You're gonna pay
for that, cop.
Why doesn't my key work anymore?
It's too small.
Oh!
Stand back.
I just-- I brought you a gift.
I'm still mad at you.
And trust me,
it wasn't easy to get. So...
Come closer
and I'll thank you.
Are you trying to give me a boner?
Closer, I said.
How about that
little tip-off?
Guarantees you a big arrest
and an accommodation.
Even from your
twisted little agency.
I'm impressed.
But then what?
Would you like to hear my plan?
Either that
or I start target practice.
Okay. The new President is on a quest
to clear out the Barillo cartel.
And Barillo has set up
a counterattack
by hiring a military general
named Marquez.
And he wants him
to throw a coup d'état
while the President's
visiting Culiacan.
Now, I have a man inside
as insurance
just to make sure that Marquez
never takes power.
The last piece
of the puzzle...
is Barillo.
Your tip-off assures
that Barillo is out of the picture
while the battle ensues.
In the aftermath
of this very healthy revolution,
I will calmly waltz away with
the 20 million pesos
that Barillo is prepared to pay
Marquez for the coup.
And you want me to go with you?
You detain Barillo
with the information that you
have, and then, uh, you join me
and share the spoils.
You meet me
two nights from now
at La Pileta, 10 p.m. sharp
and, uh, bring only
what's important to you.
Oh, yeah.
It might get a wee bit dangerous
there, sugar-butt. So...
Can you dig it?
I can dig it.
SANDS:
I want my key back.
Testing. One, two. Testing.
Hello?
Can you hear me now?
Okay-- Fucking bells.
Uh, did you assemble
your team?
You know I did.
Why me followed?
Oh, yeah, that. Let's just call that a...
guarantee of compliance, shall we?
Because Cucuy also
provides protection.
From what? Mosquitoes?
Oh, gosh, I really wouldn't want to
mess with him if I were you,
because he's a bit of a live wire,
that one.
And he's not the happiest
that you killed his man.
Oh, yeah, by the by,
I have your next assignment.
You the Mariachis?
This is the back entrance.
Make a note of it.
'-
Who are they?
Musicians.
Why so heavy?
Built-in amplifier.
Play something.
All right.
Let's go.
I was afraid you couldn't play.
EL MARIACHI: Are you kidding?
What we are looking for is
support from the people of this state.
A man can do a lot alone,
but he can do better with his
people backing him.
I wonder how much
we're getting paid for this shit.
A man who wants nothing
is invincible, cabrón.
Are you gonna tell him
that this is his last meal?
ls there a particular
song you would like to hear?
La Maraheña.
We just played for el Presidente,
I can't buy half a tequila
with this shit!
It was meant as an honor.
Fuck honor.
We need money.
The score is tomorrow.
Enough for everybody.
Even for you, Lorenzo.
Why are you suddenly interested
in the score? What's in it for you?
Only revenge.
Much delayed revenge.
Go practice.
Practice?
Playing or shooting?
What do you think?
I don't think. I drink.
Yeah, hello.
Been following Barillo
and the good Dr. Guevera.
Oh, Agent Ramirez, no longer retired.
Good man.
Welcome to the fold.
I haven't spotted any
illegal activities yet.
Only that Dr. Guevera is scheduled
for a medical procedure
Uh-huh, the Day of the Dead.
That's tomorrow.
Also identified a member of the group
as Billy Chambers.
A fugitive. We've been wanting
to pick him up for some time now.
Billy Chambers?
Yeah. You sure?
Bet my badge on xx.
Well...
whatever they're up to,
I can guarantee you
that it's going
to happen tomorrow. So...
you is--
What's
If you see an opening, take it.
What do you know?
Not enough. Get inside.
I got nothing.
I gotta get in. I got nothing.
Try to make a move.
I don't have a move to make.
What are you gonna do, stupid?
Billy Chambers is on the move.
Where are you going?
You're buying a taco.
This is too easy.
Where are the other guys?
This is a setup.
It smells like a setup.
I'm making my move.
Pollo.
Pollo.
Billy Chambers.
Well, that depends who's asking.
I thought that was you.
Here, let me pay for this.
Oh, well, thanks.
Oh, goddamn it.
Is that real?
Yes, it is.
Goddamn.
What took you boys so long?
Whoa, hey, friend.
You ain't gonna need that.
Believe it or not,
man, I'm ready to go.
Let's talk over there.
After you.
BILLY:
Man, I just wanna get out of here.
I've been on the run
hiding out here down in Mexico
for the last
eight goddamn years.
And, uh, I've been working for this
here cartel for the last four.
I ain't got shit. All I got
is what I'm wearing on my back.
I can't go nowhere. Sort of got
me by the balls, you know?
Jorge Ramirez.
I'll take you in under the FBI's
supervision and protection
until we can take you
back to the States,
where you will be prosecuted
for the crimes you committed.
In the U.S.?
In the U.S.
The things that I've had to do for
the goddamn cartel are unspeakable.
You really don't know
what Barillo's up to?
I'm close to the man.
I'm real close.
But he don't let nobody in,
that cocksucker.
Can you get him
close to Barillo?
Him?
I need your help.
Then you get me out of here.
Then I'll get you out of here.
Him too.
There's cartel
on every corner.
Sands told me you handle protection.
I don't work for Sands anymore.
And since I'm a Mexican,
I can do whatever I want.
Then I guess
I don't work for Sands neither.
Goodbye.
There's a price on your head.
I'm going to collect. Why don't you
just tell Barillo everything you know.
And then maybe
he'll just cut off your hands.
And if I don't?
You know that old man
I killed in your village?
What if your whole village
was next?
Would you kill them?
Me? They certainly would.
Then I guess I have no choice...
but to kill you all.
You...
are last.
That should put him out
for a few days...
and give him some nasty dreams.
You have
to relax your fingers.
Music is pure,
from one's soul.
If the soul is pure,
the music flows free.
And if the soul isn't pure?
Then you must practice
like a motherfucker.
I present to you, uh...
Señor Cucuy.
Get this condescending ass
out of here.
Hey, you want me to
break his fingers?
No. I want you to chop them off.
I was just making a joke.
I wasn't.
Sit, please.
So...
you are the man who brought us
the Mariachi.
The man I work for, Mr. Sands...
he is using the Mariachi
to kill General Marquez.
So you want to join us,
here's how it works.
There is the bait.
There is the trade.
A favor for a favor.
You are.
This ain't my line of work.
This guy's all fucked up.
MAN :
General Marquez is arriving!
Bring out the Mariachi!
Bring him out to the General!
EL MARIACHI : I didn't kill you before.
Enough blood had been shed.
But I see now...
that blood will spill again.
General Marquez,
the Mariachi is not here.
He escaped.
You too will escape.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, Lore--
Why?
Practice shooting, not drinking.
LORENZO:
We are on.
By order of the President,
they are searching all vehicles
for guns and drugs.
That fucker's been
blockading all the goddamn roads.
Take us back another way.
By order of the President.
Who does this guy think he is?
He wants to get rid of me?
Fine.
BARILLO:
I'll get rid of him.
yeah.
Don't put me out completely.
Have my men wait outside.
Barillo and Dr. Guevera must
already be inside of the building,
having entered
through the back or basement.
They should be mid procedure.
Federal agents.
This is going down now.
If Barillo wanted to look
unrecognizable to authorities,
he succeeded.
Massive tissue loss due to
an only partially completed
facial reconstruction wasn't
necessarily the cause of death.
They switched bodies.
Barillo!
FBI.
He was anyway.
Bring him along.
Listen, I cannot do everything
by myself.
I need someone
to go in there with me.
No. I lost my inside man.
Probably dead.
And Cucuy, greedy turd that he is,
ratted me out and has disappeared.
Plus, I'm pretty sure the cartel
is shadowing me.
Now, listen, I have got a swell bunch
of guys intercepting Marquez's army,
but they've got no guns.
Now, listen, I want you to understand me.
This is no time to screw the pooch,
because this is supposed to be
the big dance number, all right?
Hello?
Hello? Are you there?
Okay, okay,
I'm going to freak right out.
I would like the puerco
and a tequila with lime.
Yeah, listen, uh,
I need a new line.
This one's been compromised.
Okay? Thank you.
I'll be waiting here
at the La Vaca Volando.
That's right.
The Flying Cow.
You really didn't see it coming,
did you?
Sorry, baby, I told you I wasn't
interested in your scheme.
Too small.
Oh, my Christ.
Is that Barillo?
That's the new Barillo. The old Barillo
died in surgery a few hours ago.
What kind of cartel would have
you running its operation?
I'm his daughter.
You've been spying on my operation
for some time.
I feel it's only fair to warn you
that killing me is crossing the line,
and you will have every single
marine from here to Guanténamo Bay
up your keister, mister.
So just know that.
Fortunately for you, nothing you did
is worth dying over.
You have only seen too much.
We are going to make sure
that doesn't happen again.
On this day of the dead,
I offer you a chance for a new life.
That sounded a
little extreme for a parade.
Those are troops
coming up from the south, sir.
Whose?
Emiliano Marquez.
Well, what do we do?
We stay here. This place is fortified.
It's much easier to defend this place
than to chance going out in the open.
Nicholas? What are you talking
about, "fortified"? Come here!
Just stay clear of those windows, sir.
You let me handle it.
My name is Sheldon Jeffrey Sands.
I work for the
Central Intelligence Agency.
I throw shapes.
I throw shapes.
I set them up.
I watch them fall.
I'm living la  loca.
No!
I'm terribly sorry about your
chewing gum, but listen.
I will give you this...
Ouch. God.
If you'll be my eyes.
It's a dollar.
I meant...
this.
I need you to take me
to the center of the city.
ls someone following you?
Well, it's a little difficult for me to
tell right now, because I'm kind of having a bad day.
Do you see someone?
Yes, he's getting close.
Okay, okay. Listen,
have you ever seen one of these?
Have you ever used one?
No.
Don't ever, because they're
very, very bad.
But right now what I need
for you to do is to aim this
at the bad man who's following us
and shoot him in the head.
Kill him?
Oh, yeah.
Very mátalo. Close?
Si.
Okay. Smoke him.
Smoke the fucker. Just send him
straight to fucking Broadway.
What'?
No puedo.
Okay. Come here.
Right or left?
Derecha.
Was that my right or your right?
derecha.
Wrong man.
Sorry.
Look me in the eyes...
and then kill me.
Oh, good boy.
Now you're thinking.
Take me to the center of the city,
where there will be even more dough.
For you...
for our daughter...
for Mexico.
In my past, I'd
take on evil from the bottom.
Now I realize...
start at the top.
The President is a good man.
I'll go around back.
Meet me in five.
Watch him.
We could torture him.
He's FBI.
No. He's retired.
That doesn't count.
I was tortured once.
I didn't like it.
You know what
the fucked up thing is?
They tore out my left nut.
That sort of turned me off
of the whole thing.
What should we do with him?
Let's go eat about it.
Hey, Snow White,
watch that fucking pig.
Just-- Just lay low.
They'll leave us alone.
Uh-huh.
LORENZO:
What the fuck?!
I don't like military.
Get out.
Why are we stopping?
We can't go any further.
Why? Why not?
Look out there.
It's a fucking coup d'état!
I can't see, fuck-mock!
I have no eyes.
Well, then listen to it, fucker!
The military's throwing over the
presidency. All hell's broken loose.
Work. Work.
You guys have to get out now.
Keep your money, because
I'm not moving one inch.
Okay-
Fuck! Now what?
Do you know armor-piercing bullets?
Yeah.
These are much better.
What do you want in life?
Good choice.
You ready?
Yeah.
Okay, let's go!
Come on!
NICHOLAS:
Presidents! Presidente!
It's no longer safe to be here, sir.
Let's go.
Nicholas, qué pasa?
You have a meeting
with General Marquez, sir.
It feels like you need
some protection, sir.
Who are you guys?
Sons of Mexico, sir.
Are we in front of the building?
Si.
Okay-
This is it, kid.
I don't hear you running.
Why would the people want me dead?
I've done nothing but try to help them.
FIDEO: What are you talking about? Come over here.
Let me show you something.
Look out there! You see?
Well, don't look too close,
Presidente.
But your people are out there
fighting for you, you understand?
Presidente,
take off your jacket.
This also?
Yes.
Put this on.
What is this, payoff?
This is money someone paid
to have you killed.
Yeah, and now it's money
to save your life, Presidente.
Here, get some tequila
for yourself.
Leave here
and lock the door.
Carolina?
She died.
Your daughter?
She died.
And you?
Dead.
And I?
Alive and well.
In hell.
Everything in its place...
Perdón, Martin.
Nicholas?
You fucking little monkey.
Stand up.
See anything you like?
No.
JORGE: Do you remember
a man named Archuleta?
Why?
I present to you Special Agent
Jorge Ramirez.
You tortured and murdered Agent
Archuleta. He was my partner.
He was also my friend.
Agent Ramirez, you have
to follow certain rules.
Oh, I'm retired.
Rules don't apply to me
any more than they do to you.
Mr. Chambers.
Yes, sir.
You just going to stand there?
I'm afraid anything but standing's
gonna cost you extra.
You leave me no choice.
Did you get your man?
One of them.
If that isn't inter agency cooperation,
I just-- I just don't know what is.
See you later.
Fuck you.
Are you okay?
I don't know.
You will be.
What do you want in life?
To be free...
Simple.
No.
MAN :
Cucaracha!
