We put the tree up we decorate it and then she spends the month hanging out watching Lifetime and Hallmark fucking bullshit Christmas movies. I had to watch the fucking the the football game in the bedroom last night on our worst TV because she needs to hang out with the tree in the living room with the lights on and all that shit when she needs to maximize it as much as possible. So we get the tree this weekend.	-1.0

4	So we have a new tradition.	1.0
3	This is the last four or five years where we will invite our Jewish friends over and they'll their kids get to help because they're excited to decorate the truck in love it. And by the way, I don't know if I didn't agree with me, but I think decorating trees kind of a pain in the ass. I agree 1 million percent which is why I was getting people that are more excited and much more work. So it is great while I stand my end.	-1.0
4	Google so we bought our tree on Saturday and because they fucked up the trunk as I said this on the live earlier, right? So like usually the tree place trims the trunk and trims the shitty branches the bottom of the tree cleans it up for you and I think because we bought a tree from like this look specials rack and we didn't realize it the guy didn't give us any fucking but he didn't even put it in the tree stand with a lot of times I do for you to have to worry about that. You didn't do that. So we get home and I get rid of some of these shitty branches and there's like two feet of just bear trunk. Mama Bear was not having it. So we didn't end up decorating on Saturday night. How tall is the tree at the end like four feet? No, it's actually still pretty tall because we got one without all that it was like bumping the top of the ceiling we have tall ceiling. Yeah, so we didn't end up decorating them Saturday night, which was the plan. So on Sunday morning. I had to saw part of the tree off with a hand saw and then we decorate it on Sunday afternoon and the entire time we're doing a time like I am so glad my nine-year-old is 9 years old so that he can decorate the tree so that I don't have I can do it except I still had to do wrap around with this is the worst part wrap around with the lights that and then like the beads and all that shit.	-1.0
2	And then the I fucking I have a tweet about this where like my son's like hey, can I help decorate the tree? I'm like, I'm like sure he's like, what do we do with like what we put up the lights and then Mom and tell mommy tells us what we did wrong goes through and rearrange the lights and fixes the branches.	-1.0
4	I just like I really I honestly don't give a shit. But what's funny about hanging out with the tree when I was a kid our tree was in the the living room which like we had a family room and the	-1.0
2	living room we get living room was like that and you were eight like an attic wild pheasant you say the family room was like nobody hung out in there except on the holidays really write the living room is where the TV was we hung out.	-1.0
4	So like there was no hanging out with the tree unless as a kid, maybe you want to hang out in there or like after the fact we're all the presents are under you're hanging out with the presents and stuff. But now you live in an apartment you have three rooms, right? And the tree is just in your face at all times.	-1.0
3	I mean, don't get me wrong. I do love a good Christmas tree hang It's just I like the time frame to be a little bit more condensed. Yeah just can't have it the whole time because guess what these trees.	1.0
4	They absorb a lot of water. They did a water them all the time.	-1.0
3	By the way, that's sap, that's app is out for vengeance it is it hits you and your family.	-1.0

2	that this is the Christmas episode is not the Christmas episode is gonna be next week where we talk about shopping and stuff.	0.0
4	This is chores. And I do think that's a good point you like that extra sound is that decorating the tree is not a common chore because you only do it once a year, but it is a shitty chore and it's actually one place where kids come in handy if they're old enough they're excited about it and they do a lot of the work and you can sit back and do whatever this weird thing you did you bitch that's a bit.	-1.0
2	What do you make that that can't German mulled wine?	0.0

4	Glug glug missed a good you look pretty Swedish. I am I'm Swedish. So last time if you remember correctly. Oh, I wanted to know I'm wearing my glasses today for the first using means everybody. Wow. I never wear my glasses today for the first time on the podcast because you know what the people demanded it. Yep and put up a poll and people voted for it. And the people that voted against it.	-1.0
2	I can see their names and they're going to get you know, a bag of dicks in the Male, you know we can actually fucking order those. You know, what is it makes you so much more sophisticated does make me sophisticated as you just demonstrated.	-1.0
4	Yeah with my disgusting burp. I apologize for any one who had to hear that. So last two weeks ago. We did the worst parent teachers episode. And basically we got through bedtime and a couple other times it's dinner time and some other shit and there's a lot of stuff we didn't get to and we had so many comments and so many different little topics within it that we wanted to finish it off. So that's what we're doing today and the first One of the top of the paper maybe not the top of the list but the top of the paper that I put together is homework. So today my kid gets home and he has to do like reading responses once a month where he has to do basically like a really brief book report on whatever book He's reading. I had to sit down with him and like help them structure it because like each there's three paragraphs and each one has to have kind of a different thing. I'm sitting with them and I much prefer this to math homework with him because the mass shit. I can't even do half it like it's getting more snow. He's in fourth grade is getting more sophisticated in the Common Core just the principles of it are tough. And before you start bashing Common Core. Yeah. I find it difficult. I understand the rationale behind it essentially is to give you like mechanisms be able to do math in your head in a more logical way the kind of the way that we do it like if you're breaking up a tip. You divide it by 10 you do all that shit right away with not really how we were taught. We were taught memorization and all that shit. Whatever. I'm not going to get in a comic or different app.	-1.0
2	We already got a micro lesson on we definitely did some we did some writing but so like he uses the computer to write his thing and you know, how like spell check or like a grammar like if there's a proper noun.	1.0
3	He doesn't write it with him.	0.0
4	No, they letting him use computers and like his handwriting sucks and he hates it. So we're like fine, you know, nobody's gonna be my handwriting is an absolute joke, it's based its cursive because I start to write so fast and it just it's a mess and no one can be I can't even read it. So he types which is fine. It's the skill he needs to learn but like he can't deal with the red line that shows you that it's like a misspelling or a grammar issue or it's a proper noun and I fucking even knows what proper nouns I don't know when they learn that.	-1.0
2	He's like, why is this show a red line? I'm like dude. I'm like that doesn't matter like you're writing on a fucking computer.	-1.0
4	You can spell check and fix all this stuff later. You just got to get your thoughts out right and he can't fucking	-1.0
2	Get past the red line and he's like I can't do it. I'm like dude. There's fucking Cisco just write your damn thoughts of a fink clean that up after know he won't do it.	-1.0
4	I fucking hate it and I hate sitting down and doing homework with my kid because of so, what does he and of course then complains about having to do it becomes like he's like flying and oh, yeah, or he throwing a fit or he gets so frustrated that it just puts the whole thing. That's a the proceedings come to a halt. It's just super A frustrating and I don't want to do homework.	-1.0
2	I spent 20 years of my life doing homework. I'm over it.	-1.0
3	Yeah, and I think everyone would agree.	1.0
4	Well handmade is better says homework was her least favorite parenting chore. It brings out both of our ugly sides from her laziness and my stubbornness which is exactly right, right. Like he doesn't want to do it. He gets frustrated I give up so easily and then I'm like you have to fucking do it this way. I'm just fucking furious and it's too early to have a beer and you just like locked in this. Oh my God, and we are so similar. And we just it just it's a meltdown from the fucking start. G-dog Tha no idea if that's what I'm supposed to say GD OG Tha I like it you like when I break down the usernames got it figured out right on are in real time. She says not understanding the math getting them to do it and then whining the whole time yeah trying to break down the rationale behind someone like the Common Core techniques is beyond me half the time.	-1.0
3	Well, I'm often I go I go right to the internet. I'm just like common YouTube videos and shit.	-1.0
4	Yeah. Yeah, I don't really do that.	0.0
3	You got to do that and then but also what I find out what I find sometimes works is if I start doing I'm like let me do it. Look no. No, you're doing it wrong. Like well, how do you do it and they're so pissed?	-1.0

2	You can't bully me. I'm like, I'm not gonna bully you but like you tell the kid for like months like you need to Branch out and recent you might like this thing and he's fucking so reluctant to admit it and then he finally admits any gets mad because I'm proofreading his thing.	-1.0
