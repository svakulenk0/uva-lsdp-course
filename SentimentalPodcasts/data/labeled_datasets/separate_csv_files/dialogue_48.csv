2	Hi, this is Mary HK, Troy and you're listening to Hey, cool life a micro pot about mental health and creativity. Hmm. It is January the 23rd 2019 and this is episode 22 in reality. It is actually the evening of the 22nd. But um I'm a very early morning tomorrow. So I am trying to record it tonight and seeing how it goes. I've already done that thing where I fussed too much and premeditated too much. So I've tried recording it once before and I didn't like the results and I was having this Stern conversation with myself being like the whole agreement was that you Just deliver the first Pancake no matter how misshapen and raw the dough but then the sort of staunch like determination with which I refuse to let myself even like mess with it felt really ungentle.	-1.0
3	Like I was like this seems really harsh.	-1.0
2	So I'm allowing myself to record it again and see how it goes. So yeah, I I wanted to talk a little bit about friendship. You know, I am really selective about who I spend time with because you know, like I've been in recovery now from my eating disorder and like pretty much sober for about 8 months which is less than a human gestation period and it's still really new and it Really new and it takes a lot of work. And so I kind of treat myself with gentleness and acknowledge how much mental real estate this is occupying. It really beats being fully in the disease or in relapse, but you know, I do treat myself. not carefully or gingerly or with kid gloves or anything just with like, you know, just a little more tenderness than I have historically and so yeah, like I might not see a lot of people really often like I shared earlier about how I manage my day and how I only really take on two large chunks of activity a day because any more than that and I just get really anxious and	-1.0
3	I start tripping out a lot, but I've been really noticing like who I spend time with and who I talk to and there are a lot more people that I talk to who I may not see that regularly Beyond people in like my 12-step meeting and they're all great and I really really go to them and they're such a source of like infrastructure when I just need another brain to Noodle on an issue with me.	-1.0
2	me but I used to pride myself so much on being self-sufficient and I don't know like it's another one of those things where I just like felt like it was a thing that you should aspire to and should be successful at and now I'm not so so sure considering like how creative and like inventive and inaccurate my brain can be so I've been talking to a certain group of friends who are also like I would say like dealing with their own emotional homework and	1.0
3	you know, they're all writing away at their own owner's manuals and I love comparing notes and I love hearing how people are doing.	1.0
2	And so I started asking people. How are you and you know and a friend of mine who is very very that's say influential and has a massive massive social.	0.0
3	You're following once remarked after an international tour how infrequently people ask how she's doing and it how how all these responses like are so like responses on social media or even in person usually are so blithe and they're like positive assumptive. It's all like you're killing it you're crushing it. I want your life like you look this you look that you look great. You're you know, whatever.	1.0
2	And she's like, you know what? I never really get an invitation to speak or check in on how I am actually doing and I've personally found that like when my brain is overwhelmed and I'm anxious and I'm just like in that real not scribble. sometimes like asking someone else how they're doing is like a really great trick to get that light spot light off the inside of my own brain with like, you know that like and just shine a bit of attention on to something else like something outside of me and it's funny like if you ask someone how are you, you know with my friends and	-1.0
3	It's like crew of people who like we said, we like talk about our emotions all the time. We like text about like, you know, just like to give each other affirmations and all that stuff and with them it's really different, but I wanted to talk a little bit about how to really ask how someone's doing because we're so unused to it and I certainly was really, you know, I was like a foal trying to walk. It was just all like you know, like shifting weight awkwardly like buckling under certain pressures and all this stuff and When you ask how someone's doing and they're like, oh, you know the same, you know, same same tired like everyone else and they move you along.	-1.0
2	Sometimes I'll just ask like no really like what kind of day are you having and then just like people are better sometimes about talking about logistics and then like moving into how they feel about it and like a lot of times you can ask a follow-up question or like	1.0
3	Oh, yeah, like, you know an affirmation or recognition or like making space for it as an answer and be like, oh, wow, like, you know, like that sounds potentially overwhelming like how how do you feel about it? How are you doing about it?	1.0
2	And then, you know, then they can sort of talk about how they feel and and then like again because people are so in used to it.	0.0
3	I'll sometimes volunteer something to and then know that it's an invitation to ask how I'm doing and it's so basic and it's so pedestrian but you know, it's not going to be a new / that we increasingly don't talk to each other and interact in like ways to like really share data and really share truth and you know for me for a long time what helped is	0.0
2	so I just like convinced myself because for the longest time like I was just like why are people talking like I had no capacity for empathy and compassion and so I was always really confused by like when people would like share about themselves.	-1.0
3	I'm like, why is what is this Deluge that I have unwittingly subscribe to but now I feel sort of like my my perspective has really changed on it because I've reaped so many benefits and sharing how I feel because I've	1.0
2	That articulating an issue makes the issue right sized and describing it makes it feel real ER and if I say something that I believe it helps me sort of like inspect it.	1.0
3	You know, it's kind of like when someone asks you to describe a new book and you can't describe it like really concisely and like three sentences you're like, whoa needs work problems are kind of like that too.	0.0
2	They just feel a lot more outsized if you don't let it out because you're convinced that your brain will somehow fix it.	-1.0
3	Like that's where a lot of my anxiety comes from.	-1.0
2	That's where a lot of the circular thinking and rumination comes from so sometimes I just let it out and it just makes it a lot. Better but yeah, so what I had to sort of assume like the first baby step I took in this entire Enterprise of like human decency and I city is that I just like pretended as if people cared about my response like I used to be the king of being like, oh, you know just fine Kelly and you know, whatever like tired or like.	1.0
3	Oh, yeah great non-roma. How about you and just like turn that around so quickly like Like like it's like a judo move. And now I just like really take that as a sign to check in and I just pretend that people care about my response no matter how sheepish I feel about it and how embarrassed I feel about it. And now I feel like it's like a sign of weakness which high like what is like, where did that come from?	1.0
2	And that helps you get started on talking about feelings with other? and then you'll sort of find out like who the people are who aren't total like energy black holes and like who aren't just like vampiric and then those are the places where you can go to like not like totally Workshop an issue, but like just get your mind off yourself because that's where I just get into a lot of trouble and then from there.	-1.0
3	I'm at this point where now I'm like like effusive in a real way and I really like I'm flooded with gratitude and I tell all my friends that I love them and I really mean it and I don't even need MDMA to be coursing through my veins or anything like I'm just like wow like,	1.0
2	this is such a trip like we're all just doing our best and figuring things out at like a really Scribbly way and my thing it's like I forget everything I learn all the time. And so having people sort of bear witness to you and how you're doing and remember for you and you remembering for them and like everyone can like hold up a loving mirror and ask questions about why you believe the things you believe like Human beings are designed to need each other. And what's dope about that is it like once that need is met like it feels really good and it feels really safe and it feels really complete. And so even if you feel like a maniac especially if you're like a woman, especially if you are like a woman of color or you are just not like you're like average cishet, you know, like monoculture like mono conscious person who's like quote normal or a quote like skin-toned, you know, like yeah, like it's just a way to like take small defiant actions to like take up space and to like reaffirm your own agency, you know, not dump not like pollute not take advantage, but just like command that attention. Um and have and like amplifying other people and inviting them to do it to like, you know, I'm literally sitting here recording a mini pod on the floor about asking how are you like that's where I like that's the key to Wellness. Like it really really helps me and it's free. You know, so I hope you find some utility in that and I hope you have a gentle day and I hope you find small reassuring ways to accept the flavor of brain that you have in like hopefully grow to love it and appreciate it.	1.0
1	Alright. Bye.	0.0
